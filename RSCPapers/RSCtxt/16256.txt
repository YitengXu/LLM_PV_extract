    , Accepted 18th September 2018First published on 19th September 2018AbstractAnthocephalus cadamba shaped carbon nanostructures comprising FeNi encapsulated in radially grown nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) are produced by controlled pyrolysis which exhibit advanced electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a low overpotential of ∼290 mV at 10 mA cm−2, small Tafel slope (37 mV dec−1) and endurance in an accelerated stability test. In addition to better surface electron transfer kinetics, the radial growth of NCNTs offers plenty of electrochemically active sites (high roughness factor ∼340) in tiny spaces, better accessibility to reactant species and appropriate gas outlets to prevent bubble accumulation during OER. Besides OER, the preferential 4e− pathways for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and excellent overall oxygen electrochemistry ΔE (Ej(OER)=10 − E1/2(ORR) = 0.71 V) suggest excellent bifunctionality and advocate the practical importance of Anthocephalus cadamba shaped carbon nanostructures as a possible unitary oxygen electrocatalyst for metal–air battery systems.
Introduction
Emergence of sustainable, eco-friendly electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices like unified regenerative fuel cells and metal–air batteries demand electrocatalysts to achieve the desirable oxygen evolution/reduction reaction (OER/ORR) rate to overcome their sluggish kinetics owing to the multiple sequential electron transfers involved.1–4 Precious metal based electrocatalysts such as Pt-group based nanostructures are widely studied/explored for ORR, while the Ru/Ir based oxides are for OER.1–9 Besides limited reserves, high cost and operational instability of these benchmark electrocatalysts, their mono-functionality (e.g. Pt-based nanostructures which are excellent for ORR, have a much inferior OER activity and the Ru/Ir based electrocatalysts which are best used for OER show very poor ORR activity) is a major obstacle in the commercial domain and technological scalability.1–4,10 Importantly, unlike ORR which is a gas consuming reaction, OER is a more aggressive process, due to gaseous product evolution, and requires appropriate gas outlets to prevent bubble accumulation.4,10 Recently, tremendous efforts have been devoted to exploring non-precious transition metal based electrocatalysts through sensible designing for next generation electrochemical devices.10–19 Among the various available selections, studies suggest that NiFe based nanomaterials, in particular, are promising OER electrocatalysts with good activity and stability in an alkaline medium due to the synergy between Ni and Fe which modifies the electronic structure and consequently optimizes the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates.20–29 Nevertheless, these FeNi based nanostructures also suffer from poor ORR activity and consequently, are practically limited to electrolyzers only and are not suitable for devices like metal–air batteries and fuel cells where ORR also plays the decisive role in performance evaluation.21 The recent literature survey suggests that the presence of hetero-atoms (e.g. N, B, S, P etc.) in carbon nanostructures (CNS) like carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, etc. activates these CNS electrochemically towards ORR.10,11,30–39 Moreover, the hetero-atoms like N, in particular, easily co-ordinates with transition metals to form the M–NxC complexes during the course of the synthesis and are considered as highly efficient active centres for oxygen electrochemistry.10,11,15,17,18 Though recent scientific contributions suggest that transition metal–carbon based nanoelectrocatalysts have potential to perform bifunctional oxygen electrochemistry (ORR/OER),10–19 the cycling loss caused by the combined large overpotentials (ηORR + ηOER, for oxygen electrochemistry) in systems like a metal–air battery diminishes the cycling efficiency and power output by 70% and needs to be minimized for efficient utilization and practical realization of these devices.3 The matrix which provides a measure of the combined overpotentials for oxygen electrochemistry and a better reversible oxygen electrode behaviour is represented by ΔE (= Ej(OER)=10 − E1/2(ORR) where Ej=10 mA is the potential at which the OER current density attained a value of 10 mA cm−2 and E1/2 is the half-wave potential of ORR on electrocatalysts under study) and its magnitude should be as small as possible for minimizing the cycling loss.3,33 Therefore, electrochemically, the most active catalysts must be rationally designed and implemented to reduce the magnitude of the combined overpotentials in order to make the process (ORR/OER) energy-efficient. Consequently, rational designing of highly active, economical, earth-abundant transition metal based resilient electrocatalysts is of paramount importance in the attempt to assimilate the bifunctionality (ORR/OER) for efficient overall oxygen electrochemistry.
Herein, we report a single-step facile approach to obtain Anthocephalus cadamba shaped carbon nanostructures comprising FeNi nanoparticles encapsulated in radially grown nitrogen-doped CNTs (NCNTs) produced by controlled pyrolysis of ferrocene, nickelocene and melamine. The radially grown and spatially separated NCNTs are expected to accommodate plenty of electrochemically active sites in tiny spaces, thereby, offering better accessibility of electrochemically active sites to the reactant species, enhanced electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), appropriate gas outlets to prevent bubble accumulation in OER and consequently smaller ΔE (=Ej(OER)=10 − E1/2(ORR)) = 0.71 V as compared to the various recently reported transition metal–carbon based state-of-the-art nanoelectrocatalysts for overall oxygen electrochemistry.
Results and discussion
Structural characterization
FeNi nanoparticles encapsulated in NCNTs are obtained by pyrolysis of ferrocene, nickelocene and melamine at 750 °C (Fig. S1†) by varying the temperature ramping rate by 3, 10, 25, and 40 °C min−1, and accordingly named FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of different FNMR are shown in Fig. 1a–h at different magnifications. It is noted from the SEM images that the temperature ramping rate during pyrolysis significantly influences the final structure of FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25 and 40), and the structure obtained for FN25R (Fig. 1e and f) shows radially grown diverging NCNTs that resemble Anthocephalus cadamba (inset of Fig. 1e) which is further validated by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images as shown in Fig. 2. The bright-field, dark-field and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images (Fig. 2a–c) clearly indicate the radially grown NCNTs with FeNi nanoparticles encapsulation. For better visualisation, in an attempt to see the individual NCNT of FN25R closely, a small amount of the FN25R sample was dispersed in an ethanol solution and sonicated for ∼1 h. The HAADF-STEM image of a single NCNT of FN25R clearly indicates the encapsulation of FeNi nanoparticles in a NCNT bamboo compartment. This kind of metal nanoparticle encapsulation due to unique host and guest interactions activates the enveloping carbon electrochemically and at the same time the carbon layers of NCNTs protect these nanoparticles from leaching or agglomeration providing better electroactivity and improved operational stability of the electrocatalyst.11,12,40 The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image indexing of such an encapsulated nanoparticle suggests the presence of (111) planes of FeNi.24 The drift-corrected imaging and elemental mapping (area marked in box) further suggest the presence of iron and nickel in the encapsulated nanoparticles (Fig. 2e–g). Overall, the Anthocephalus cadamba (as shown in Fig. 1e,f and 2a–c) shaped carbon nanostructures are expected to be advantageous in electrochemistry as they may offer, due to radially grown NCNTs, a large ECSA with better accessibility to reactant species and improved surface charge transfer kinetics by accommodating plenty of active sites.

The Raman study as shown in Fig. 3a clearly indicates the higher ID/IG ratio for FN25R (∼1.12) as compared to FN3R (∼0.94), FN10R (∼1.05) and FN40R (∼0.93), where ID and IG represent the intensity of defect band (D ∼ 1360 cm−1) and graphitic band (G ∼ 1580 cm−1), respectively. The high ID/IG ratio indicates the increased surface defect density which can be largely attributed to the incorporation of hetero-atoms in the carbon matrix.41

(h) Total metallic (Fe + Ni) as evaluated using ICP-AES for each 50 mg of FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40) and nitrogen atomic% evaluated using XPS study (inset of h). 
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns as shown in Fig. 3b consist of diffraction peaks centred around 44.6°, 51.9° and 76° corresponding to the characteristic reflections arising from (111), (200) and (220) planes of a face-centred cubic phase of FeNi nanoparticles in FNMR (JCPDS # 03-1109).24,25,29 It is observed that the intensity of FN25R is stronger among FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40) which can be attributed to the comparatively higher metallic content in FN25R as evident by the inductive coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) study discussed subsequently. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study has been performed on FNMR to access the surface chemical compositions and elemental valance states. The wide XPS spectra show the presence of characteristic C1s, N1s, Fe2p and Ni2p (Fig. 3c) peaks in addition to surface adsorbed oxygen. Fig. 3d–h and S2–S4† show the deconvoluted high resolution XPS (HRXPS) spectra of C1s, N1s, Fe2p and Ni2p for FNMR (M = 25, 3, 10, and 40), respectively. The deconvolution of the C1s HRXPS spectrum (Fig. 3d) of FN25R suggests the signature of various carbon functionalities such as sp2-C (∼284.4 eV), sp2-C–N (∼285.4 eV), sp3-C–N (∼286.5 eV) and some carbon–oxygen interactions.10–13 Depending upon the nitrogen chemical environment and interactions with other elements, the deconvolution of the N1s spectrum suggests the presence of pyridinic (N1 ∼ 397.8), pyrrolic (N3 ∼ 399.6 eV), quaternary (N4 ∼ 400.7 eV) and some oxygenated nitrogen (N5 ∼ 401.7 eV) functionalities (Fig. 3e).10–13,18,32,33,37
Among the various available nitrogen functionalities, the pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen with a characteristic binding energy of 398.6 ± 0.3 eV easily co-ordinate with transition metals like Fe/Ni to form M–NxC (M = Fe, Ni) complexes.10–13,15,18 These M–NxC centres (Fig. 3e, N2 ∼ 398.7 eV shaded area) are electrochemically active and are extremely beneficial in oxygen electrochemistry.10–13,15,18 On the other hand, the quaternary nitrogen moieties modulate the C–N bonding in the carbon matrix close to the O–O bond length and promote easy oxygen adsorption which in turn improves the ORR activity.32a The overall nitrogen atomic percentage is found to be ∼8.1, 8.4, 10.8, and 8% for FN3R, FN10R, FN25R, and FN40R, respectively. The normalized elemental composition as evaluated from XPS (Experimental section)32b is summarised in Table S1† which suggests high nitrogen and metallic atomic percentage in FN25R as compared to other electrocatalysts (FNMR, M = 3, 10, and 40) used in this study. The HRXPS spectra of Fe2p and Ni2p (Fig. 3g and h) can be deconvoluted to resolve the various states of the Fe (Fe0, Fe2+, Fe3+ and Fe2+ satellite peak) and Ni (Ni0, Ni2+, Ni3+ and Ni2+ satellite peak) species in FN25R. The peaks centred around 707.9, 710.9, and 713.6 eV can be attributed to the Fe0, Fe2+, and Fe3+ 2p3/2 states whereas the peaks centred around 719.3, 724.2, and 727.6 eV can be attributed to the Fe0, Fe2+, and Fe3+ 2p1/2 states.10–14,22–24 Besides, a Fe2+ satellite peak at 716.3 eV has been observed.13,22 Similarly, the peaks centred around 852.9, 854.7, and 857 eV can be attributed to the Ni0, Ni2+, and Ni3+ 2p3/2 states whereas the peaks centred around 869.3, 872, and 874.8 eV can be attributed to the Ni0, Ni2+, and Ni3+ 2p1/2 states.20–29 A Ni2+ satellite peak has been also observed around 861.8 eV.22 It may be noted that the XPS study reveals the shift of peaks corresponding to the Fe species towards high binding energy whereas the shift for Ni is towards the low binding energy side with respect to the monometallic Fe/Ni systems.42,43 This shift can be attributed to the difference in electronegativity44 of Fe (1.8) and Ni (1.9) which further indicates the electronic modification due to the formation of bimetallic FeNi nanoparticles. It has been observed that the shift is not symmetric which may be ascribed to some additional electronic modification due to the presence of a variety of nitrogen moieties in the vicinity of Fe/Ni species which can result in the M–Nx (M = Fe, Ni) coordination in the structure as evident by the presence of the N2 moieties in deconvoluted HRXPS of FNMR (Fig. 3e and S2–S4†).44b The total metallic contents (Fe + Ni) are carefully evaluated by inductive coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Experimental section). It has been found that for each 50 mg of electrocatalysts, the amount of metallic content is 7.9 (Fe ∼ 4.4 mg and Ni ∼ 3.5 mg), ∼8.6 (Fe ∼ 4.2 mg and Ni ∼ 4.4 mg), 15.7 (Fe ∼ 10.8 mg, and Ni ∼ 4.9 mg) and ∼6.43 mg (Fe ∼ 3.93 mg, and Ni ∼ 2.5 mg) in FN3R, FN10R, FN25R, and FN40R, respectively as shown in Fig. 3h. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area, evaluated by nitrogen adsorption–desorption process, is found to be ∼126 m2 g−1 for FN25R and is superior to that for FN3R (∼67 m2 g−1), FN10R (∼72 m2 g−1), and FC40R (∼62 m2 g−1). Overall, the experimental findings suggest that the temperature ramping rate during the synthesis of FNMR influences the final morphology (Fig. 1) in addition to the total nitrogen (inset of Fig. 3h) and metallic (Fe + Ni) content in the structure (Fig. 3h), which in turn can modify the overall oxygen electrochemistry.
Oxygen electrochemistry
In an attempt to access the electrocatalytic activity of the as-synthesized FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40), the OER study has been performed in an alkaline medium (1 M NaOH) using a standard three electrode system with Pt-ring as the counter, KCl saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference and FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40) modified glassy carbon as the working electrodes, respectively. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) OER polarization curves recorded at 1200 rpm and at a scan speed of 10 mV s−1 using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) system with FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40) are shown in Fig. 4a. For a comparative study, the LSV-OER polarization curves are recorded on commercially available state-of-the-art Pt–C and RuO2 electrocatalysts too, under similar experimental conditions. Interestingly, the greatly enhanced OER current is observed on FN25R (94 mA cm−2), largely exceeding that of Pt–C (15 mA cm−2), RuO2 (30 mA cm−2) in addition to FN3R (25 mA cm−2), FN10R (46 mA cm−2) and FN40R (17 mA cm−2) at 1.7 V vs. RHE, and is shown in the inset of Fig. 4a. Table 1 summarises the OER electrocatalytic activity of FNMR, Pt/C and RuO2. The OER on-set potential (Eon-set, the potential corresponding to 2 mA cm−2 is taken for this study) and the potential required to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Ej=10, an important metric associated with an integrated solar water-splitting system) are carefully evaluated from Fig. 4a to access the comparative OER activity of various electrocatalysts and compared in Table 1. To our delight, the FN25R offers a current density of 2 mA cm−2 at 1.4 V (Eon-set, η2 = 170 mV, η2 indicates the overpotential at 2 mA cm−2) and 10 mA cm−2 at 1.52 V (Ej=10, η10 = 290 mV, η10 indicates the overpotential at 10 mA cm−2), respectively. It may be noted that these potentials are much lower than that for FN3R (η2 = 330, η10 = 390 mV), FN10R (η2 = 260, η10 = 340 mV), FN40R (η2 = 350, η10 = 420 mV), Pt–C (η2 = 340, η10 = 430 mV) and RuO2 (η2 = 260, η10 = 350 mV) as well (Fig. 4b, Table 1). This performance is better than those of various recently reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts (Table S2†) based on the FeNi system such as NiFe/CNx (η10 = 360 mV), FeNi/nanocarbon hybrids (η10 = 330 mV), FeNi-LDH nanosheets (η10 = 302 mV), NiO/NiFe2O4(η10 = 303 mV), and NiFe-LDH/CNT (η10 = 300 mV) in an alkaline medium.29 In order to study the intrinsic OER catalytic kinetics, we examined the Tafel plots.45,46 The Tafel slope (Fig. 4c, Table 1) obtained for FN25R (∼37 mV dec−1) is lower than that for FN3R (∼43 mV dec−1), FN10R (∼48 mV dec−1), FN40R (∼57 mV dec−1), Pt–C (∼50 mV dec−1) and RuO2 (∼70 mV dec−1) which suggests favourable reaction kinetics of FN25R. In order to see the validity of the Tafel analysis, the rotation dependent OER polarization curves are recorded47 on FN25R in a 1 M NaOH solution at a scan speed of 10 mV s−1. It is observed that (inset of Fig. 4d) the OER current density at 1.75 V vs. RHE is constant and the OER polarization curves nearly overlap with each other (Fig. 4d) irrespective of the working electrode rotation speed (400, 800, 1200 and 1600 rpm) suggesting a negligible effect of mass transfer.13,47 To shed some more light on the reaction kinetics, the OER order has been evaluated by recording the LSV-OER polarization curves in 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1 M NaOH aqueous solutions (Fig. 4e). The reaction order for OER, as deduced from Fig. 4e, is first order with respect to OH− (Fig. 4f) which signifies that each electrochemical active centre in FN25R entertains a single OH− ion for all steps involved in OER process.12 The possible reaction steps involved in OER in an alkaline medium, assuming a single site mechanism (which is evident by first order reaction kinetics, Fig. 4f) as suggested by Shinagawa and co-workers in an alkaline medium can be written as46 A + OH− ↔ AOH + e−(1) AOH + OH− ↔ AO + H2O + e−(2) AO + OH− ↔ AOOH + e−(3) AOOH + OH− ↔ AOO− + H2O(4) AOO− ↔ A + O2 + e−(5)where A indicates the electrochemical active site available on the surface of an electrocatalyst. Depending upon the coverage of the reaction intermediates AOH, AO, AOOH and AOO− in due course, each reaction step (eqn (1)–(5)) can be the rate determining process for OER.46 The theoretical study suggests that for a single site mechanism the high coverage of the electrochemically active sites (A) with OH− ions accounts for a very small Tafel slope (∼30 mV dec−1) with eqn (1) as the rate determining step.46 In the present study, the experimentally obtained smaller Tafel slope (∼37 mV dec−1) is in accordance with the first order reaction kinetics which suggests that eqn (1) is the possible rate determining step for OER on FN25R in an alkaline medium.

Further, to understand the better OER performance of FN25R among FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40), the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded in a 1 M NaOH aqueous solution at a scan speed of 10–100 mV s−1 in a non-faradaic region (Fig. S5†) and the double layer capacitance (Cdl) is evaluated.45 Interestingly, the BET specific surface area and ECSA follow the linear monotonic pattern as shown in Fig. S6.† The high specific BET surface area, Cdl, ECSA and large surface roughness factor (Rf) for FN25R (Cdl ∼ 13.6 mF cm−2, ECSA ∼ 23.8 cm2, Rf ∼ 340) among FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40) as evident from Fig. 4g,h and Table 2, may account for the better OER performance. This large Cdl, ECSA and Rf values obtained for FN25R are in agreement with the Raman study (Fig. 3a) which shows a large ID/IG ratio (∼1.12, indicates the richness in surface defect). Thus, the Anthocephalus cadamba shaped carbon nanostructures due to the radially growing FeNi encapsulated in NCNTs offer better accessibility of reactant species with plenty of electrochemically active sites.

To shed some more light on the OER performance of various electrocatalysts under study, we evaluated the surface electron transfer kinetics (the ease with which the electron transfer takes place between the catalyst and reactant species)10–12,48 of FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40) by implementing the one electron involved quasi-reversible [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− redox process in an aqueous solution of 5 mM [Fe(CN)6]3− and 0.5 M KCl. The higher current density (anodic/cathodic, Fig. 4i) with smaller redox peaks separation (ΔE = EO − ER = 93 mV, Fig. 4j) of FN25R as compared to FN3R (∼118 mV), FN10R (∼103 mV) and FN40R (119 mV) advocates for the better surface electron transfer kinetics/reaction reversibility48 of FN25R under similar experimental conditions, which in turn supports the improved OER performance. Further, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements in a 1 M NaOH solution suggest the smallest charge transfer resistance for FN25R as compared to FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40), Pt–C and RuO2 as evident from the Nyquist plots (Fig. S7†) advocating for the favorable charge transfer kinetics. Moreover, Fig. 4k shows the CV curves recorded for FN25R at different scan rates of 10–100 mV s−1 with very well defined redox peaks. Interestingly, the linear variation of the redox peak current density (Janodic) with scan rate (Fig. 4l) suggests that the electrochemical process is mainly confined to the surface of the electrocatalysts.48 Consequently, the FN25R with high BET surface area, ECSA and Rf offers/supports the improved/better OER activity among FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40). The accelerated stability test (AST, @1200 rpm and 100 mV s−1 scan speed) has been implemented to study the operational stability, and suggests 92% current retention by FN25R after 2000 cycles (Fig. S8†).
To explore the bifunctionality towards complete oxygen electrochemistry (OER and ORR), we also investigated the electrocatalytic ORR performances of FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40) in an oxygen saturated 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) system (Fig. 5a).

The Eon-set (the potential corresponding to 50 μA cm−2 for the present study) and half-wave potential (E1/2) deduced from the ORR-RRDE polarization curves (Fig. 5a) are used to evaluate the ORR activity.1b The FN25R exhibits much more positive Eon-set (∼0.937 V) and E1/2 (∼0.810 V) potentials as compared to FN3R (∼0.828, 0.690 V), FN10R (∼0.898, 0.700 V), and FN40R (∼0.891, 0.629 V, Fig. 5b) with enhanced ORR current density among FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, 40, Fig. 5a). In addition to better Eon-set and E1/2, FN25R having a smaller Tafel slope (55 mV dec−1, evaluated in a low-overpotential region, Fig. S9†) than that for FN3R (80 mV dec−1), FN10R (67 mV dec−1), FN40R (108 mV dec−1) which suggest the more favourable ORR kinetics for FN25R (Fig. S9†). The better ORR performance of FN25R may be owed to the high BET surface area, Cdl, large ECSA and Rf (Fig. 4g and h, Table 2), better surface electron transfer kinetics (Fig. 4i and j) as is the case with OER. It is evident from Fig. 4a and b that RuO2 (η2 = 260, η10 = 350 mV) shows better OER activity in comparison to Pt–C (η2 = 340, η10 = 430 mV) under similar experimental conditions. However, for ORR, Pt–C (Eon-set ∼ 0.908 V, E1/2 ∼ 0.815 V) outclasses RuO2 (∼0.756 V, ∼0.518 V) which suggests the mono-functionality of these precious metal based electrocatalysts and limits their suitability/applicability where bifunctionality is much needed. Nevertheless, the FN25R in addition to enhanced OER activity (η2 = 170, η10 = 290 mV, Fig. 4a and b), emulates Pt–C (Tafel slope ∼ 50 mV dec−1, Fig. S9†) for ORR activity and is better than the various recently reported non-noble electrocatalysts for ORR (Table S3†). Moreover, the electron transfer no. (n) for per oxygen molecule reduction and percentage peroxide (% H2O2) generation (Fig. 5c and d) during ORR process are deduced from Fig. 5a using eqn (6) and (7), respectively.7,8,11,12 (6) (7)where n is the electron transfer no., Id is the disk and Ir is the ring current. N represents the collection efficiency of the Pt ring electrode (0.3). The study suggests, besides Pt–C, the FN25R has a better electron transfer no. and less peroxide generation among FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40) and RuO2, advocating the preferential 4e− ORR pathways (Fig. 5c and d).
The AST study of FN25R (@1200 rpm and 100 mV s−1 scan speed) shows a current retention value of ∼94% after 2000 cycles (Fig. S10†) which reveals its better cycling stability during the ORR process too. The SEM image and XRD pattern (Fig. S11†) of FN25R recorded after ORR-AST show that the overall structure remains the same.
To appraise the performance of electrocatalysts under study towards overall oxygen electrochemistry (ORR + OER, bifunctionality), we compared the overvoltage associated with OER and ORR by evaluating ΔE = Ej(OER)=10 − E1/2(ORR).15–19,33–39 The smaller magnitude of ΔE implies less cycling efficiency loss and better electrochemical performance than those of a reversible oxygen electrode.1,3,15–19,33–39 The ΔE value as deduced from the OER (Fig. 4a and b) and ORR (Fig. 5a and b) studies, obtained for FN25R (Fig. 5c) is ∼0.71 V, which is much smaller than that for FN3R (∼0.93 V), FN10R (∼0.87 V), FN40R (∼1.02 V), Pt–C (∼0.855 V) and RuO2 (∼1.062 V), reassuring better bifunctionality of FN25R. In addition, the evaluated ΔE for FN25R is much lower than for the various recently reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts in the alkaline medium (Table S4†) which includes e.g. non-metallic hetero atom doped/co-doped carbon nanomaterials like P-doped C3N4 (ΔE ∼ 0.96 V),38 NGRW (ΔE ∼ 0.75 V),37 N,S-doped carbon nanosheet (ΔE ∼ 0.88 V),33 MWNCNTs@S–N–C (ΔE ∼ 1.25 V),39 B-MWCNTs (ΔE ∼ 1.2 V),36 N-doped graphene–CNT nanocomposites (ΔE ∼ 1.00 V),35 and N–MWCNT (ΔE ∼ 1.05 V),34 transition metal based carbon nanocomposites like Fe/Fe3C@NGL-NCNT (ΔE ∼ 1.29 V),19 Fe/Fe3C@ N-graphitic layer (ΔE ∼ 0.97 V),13 Fe/N/C@BMZIF (ΔE ∼ 0.79 V),18 Fe3C–NCNTs co-embedded boron doped carbon (ΔE ∼ 0.788 V),12 and Fe3C–FeNx enriched carbon sphere (ΔE ∼ 0.758 V),11 in addition to the transition metal oxides based bifunctional electrocatalysts like LiCoO2 (ΔE ∼ 0.97 V),49MnxOy(CoxOy)/N-doped carbon (ΔE ∼ 0.87 V),50 NiCo2O4/graphene (ΔE = 0.915 V),12,33 CaMn4Ox (ΔE = 1.04 V),12,33 CoFe2O4/N–P-biocarbon (ΔE = 0.98 V),51 CoFe2O4/rGO (ΔE = 0.98 V),52 and NiO/CoN PINWs (ΔE ∼ 0.85 V).17 The FN25R further surpasses some of the active and popular precious metal based electrocatalysts like Pt/C (ΔE = 0.94 V) and Ir/C (ΔE = 0.92 V).32 Overall, the FN25R collectively shows the superior oxygen electrochemistry and may be of practical importance.
Practical realization
Motivated by the enhanced overall oxygen electrochemistry (OER and ORR) of FN25R, we fabricated a prototype of the metal–air battery system as a practical demonstration of ORR, with 3 × 1 cm2 aluminium foil (a common house hold) as the metal electrode (Fig. 6a) and FN25R drop-casted on carbon paper (CNP, the loading is maintained to ∼0.4 mg cm−2, Fig. 6b) as air the cathode. The fabricated metal–air battery system is used for powering the light emitting diode (LED) in an attempt to study the practical viability of the electrocatalyst in an ambient environment. The Al-foil and FN25R@CNP are appropriately wrapped with a porous cloth used as a separator, and the whole assembly is dipped in a 3 M NaOH aqueous solution (as an electrolyte). A prototype of such a battery is shown in Fig. 6c. To our delight, three such prototype battery systems joined in series are capable of powering two red LEDs (Fig. 6d). In an attempt to study the variation of open circuit potential (OCP), we fabricated a prototype battery as discussed above with 1 mm thick Al-foil. The careful continuous monitoring of OCP suggests that it drops from 1.223 to 1.161 V in 200 h (Fig. 6e) which indicates excellent stability and applicability of FN25R as an air-cathode electrocatalyst. Fig. 6f and g display the optical photographs of a standard three electrode electrochemical setup consisting of 1 – Pt counter, 2 – Ag/AgCl reference and 3 – FN25R coated carbon paper as the working electrodes in an alkaline aqueous solution, used for possible visualization/realization of OER process on FN25R. The accumulation of oxygen bubbles on FN25R@CNP as evident from Fig. 6g exhibits the OER facilitation.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the study suggests that the temperature ramping rate during the pyrolysis of ferrocene, nickelocene and melamine, influences the final morphology, in addition to the total nitrogen and metallic (Fe + Ni) content in the structure. A ramping rate of 25 °C (FN25R) results in Anthocephalus cadamba shaped carbon nanostructures comprising FeNi encapsulated in radially grown NCNTs. The diverging and spatially separated NCNTs accommodate plenty of electrochemically active sites in tiny spaces offering better accessibility of electrochemically active sites to the reactant species. In addition, the overall structure offers an enhanced electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), higher specific BET surface area, appropriate gas outlets to prevent bubble accumulation in OER, and better surface electron transfer kinetics. Besides promising OER, the preferential 4e− ORR process ensures the bifunctionality in an alkaline medium with a smaller ΔE (=Ej(OER)=10 − E1/2(ORR)) ∼ 0.71 V as compared to the various recently reported transition metal–carbon based state-of-the-art nanoelectrocatalysts for overall oxygen electrochemistry. The smaller ΔE suggests that the OER and ORR processes are more energy-efficient on FN25R as evident by the smaller Tafel slope and high current density for the respective electrochemical processes and may be of practical importance.
Experimental section
Materials
The materials used for the present study include bis(cyclopentadienyl)nickel (Sigma Aldrich, 99% purity), bis(cyclopentadienyl)iron (Merck, 98% purity), melamine (C3H6N6, S.D. Fine Chemicals, 97.5% purity), Milli-Q water, (conductivity ∼ 5 × 10−8 S) and sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH, S.D. Fine Chemicals, AR grade), commercial Pt–C (20 wt% Pt) (Arora-Matthey, India) and RuO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9% purity). All chemicals were used as received.
Synthesis of FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40)
40 mg of bis(cyclopentadienyl)nickel (nickelocene) and 40 mg of bis(cyclopentadienyl)iron (ferrocene) and 100 mg of melamine were mixed properly using a mortar and pestle. The obtained mixture was used as a precursor and transferred to a quartz tube of 11 mm diameter and 60 cm of length closed at one end as shown in Fig. S1.† The open end of the quartz tube was connected with a rubber bladder to collect the residual gases as shown in Fig. S1.† The precursors were kept at the closed end of the tube. The closed end of the quartz tube was placed in the middle of the furnace (Lenton LTF 14/--/180, Fig. S1†). The pyrolysis temperature used for this study was 750 °C and maintained for a duration of 1.1 h. Once the reaction was completed, the furnace was allowed to cool down to room temperature. The temperature ramping rate used for this study was 3, 10, 25, and 40 °C min−1, and the samples are named accordingly FN3R, FN10R, FN25R and FN40R. The deposited FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40) at the inner wall of the quartz tube was gently removed and collected for further studies.
Morphological and structural characterization
The samples were characterized by the following techniques which include an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; X'PertPRO PANanalytical) operating in the reflection mode with Cu Kα radiation λ = 1.5417 Å, at a scan rate of 0.05 s−1 and the 2θ range applied was 5–90°. A scanning electron microscope (SEM; FEI Inspect F50 models) operating at 20 kV was used for the investigation of the morphology, and a transmission electron microscope (FEI TITAN THEMIS 300) operating at 300 kV was used for bright-, dark- and high angle annular dark field imaging. Raman spectroscopy of the sample was carried out using a WITec Alpha 300 (Nd:YAG laser source, excitation wavelength 532 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS ULTRA DLD from Kratos, monochromatic Al Kα 1486.6 eV excitation source) was used to investigate the interaction between the elements, a compositional study. The specific BET surface area for FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40) is evaluated using nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm analysis using a BET Surface Analyser (Smart System). For the ICP-AES measurements 50 mg of each FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40) sample has been annealed at 600 °C in an oxygen environment to remove carbon. The residual metallic content obtained after annealing is dissolved in a water–aqua regia solution (1:2 volume ratio) of 15 ml and subjected to magnetic stirring for 3 h followed by sonication (∼30 min) to obtain a homogeneous solution prior to the ICP-AES study.
Elemental atomic percentage calculation
The elemental atomic percentage in FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40) has been evaluated by integrating the area under the curves for the respective XPS spectrum, the obtained area was normalized with the respective sensitivity factor (SF) as shown in eqn (8). (8)where i = C/N/Ni/Fe; SFC = 0.25, SFN = 0.42, SFFe = 3, and SFNi = 4.5.
Electrochemical measurements
The OER and ORR studies were carried out at room temperature using a standard three-electrode cell (CHI752, USA) with a commercial glassy carbon electrode (GCE, active geometrical area of ∼0.07 cm2 for the RDE and 0.196 cm2 for the RRDE, CHI Instruments) covered by active materials (FNMR) with Nafion® as a binder (5%, Sigma Aldrich) solution served as the working electrode, Pt ring as the counter electrode and KCl saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. 7 mg of the materials (FNMR) was dispersed in a 1 ml mixture of Milli-Q water and ethanol (50:50%) solution followed by sonication for 1 h to form homogenous ink. 60 μl of this ink then transferred to other plastic vials with 15 μl of Nafion® solution followed by a sonication for 30 min. Then 5 μl of this catalyst ink was drop-casted on the active carbon area of the glassy carbon electrode by using a micropipette and drying under an IR lamp. The catalyst loading used for the OER/ORR study was maintained to 0.4 mg cm−2. For a better comparative study, all the potentials are converted with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the equation ERHE = Eo Ag/AgCl + (0.059 × pH) + EAg/AgCl, where Eo Ag/AgCl is 0.197 V vs. SHE. The ORR polarization curves were recorded in an oxygen purged 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution. To evaluate the electron transfer no. (n) per electrochemically reduced oxygen molecule and percentage peroxide generation associated with ORR process, the RRDE-ORR polarization curves were recorded at 2200 rpm and 10 mV s−1 scan speed in the potential window of 0.05 to −0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl. To monitor the peroxide generation, the Pt-ring electrode was kept at a constant potential (0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl). The OER study was performed in a 1 M NaOH aqueous solution, purged with nitrogen gas prior to the experiment, at a scan speed of 10 mV s−1 and a rotation speed of 1200 rpm in the potential window of 0 to 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The Tafel slope was evaluated in a current window of 5–15 mA cm−2 for uniformity on each electrocatalyst in the present study. To evaluate the double layer capacitance (Cdl) of the FNMR system, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded in the non-faradaic region at different scan speeds of 10–100 mV s−1. As the recorded current on FNMR modified GCE was normalized with the active geometrical surface area of the electrodes (RDE-GCE ∼ 0.07 and RRDE-GCE ∼ 0.196 cm2) the loading of the commercial catalyst used for comparative studies was maintained the same as that of FNMR.
The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and roughness factor (Rf) of FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40) electrocatalysts are evaluated using eqn (9) and (10).2 (9) (10)where Cdl (Fig. S4),† represents the double layer capacitance deduced from the CV curves recorded in the non-faradaic region (Fig. S4†) at different sweeping speeds (Fig. S4†), Cs exhibit the standard capacitance of the atomically flat surface of the respective materials per unit area under identical experimental conditions (Cs = 0.040 mF cm−2).2 The active geometrical area of the electrode (Ag ∼ 0.07 cm2), the FNMR (M = 3, 10, 25, and 40), and loading used for the Cdl study was 0.4 mg cm−2. The Cdl values used for ECSA evaluation are 0.548, 0.615, 0.952 and 0.434 mF for FN3R, FN10R, FN25R and FN40R, respectively, under similar experimental conditions.
