    , Accepted 16th April 2020First published on 16th April 2020AbstractMulticomponent perovskites of the type CsxFA1−xPb(BryI1−y)3 are good candidates for highly efficient perovskite and tandem solar cells. In this work the degradation mechanisms of these multicomponent films were investigated and our results show that the degradation is a complex process, with the formation of a number of intermediates and lead-based products. In situ X-ray diffraction analysis carried out in the first stages of the degradation indicate that different from MAPbI3 perovskites, the degradation of these multicomponent films begins with the formation of hexagonal polytypes as intermediates, which in turn are converted to hydrated phases. The initial steps of the degradation were also monitored for the first time by in situ environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) with 75% of relative humidity. In situ ESEM images show that the degradation has its beginning at the “valleys” of the wrinkled morphology found in these films, possibly because of a smaller grain size in these regions. XPS analysis confirms that the hydrated perovskite films continue to react with the environment, leading to the formation of metal hydroxides, carbonates, and oxides as final products. Our results also indicate that the degradation mechanism is highly dependent on the Cs concentration and Br content providing guidance for choosing the best compositions for efficient, but more environmentally stable solar cells.
Introduction
In the last decade, research on organic–inorganic, hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has advanced rapidly due to their excellent optoelectronic properties combined with low-cost and solution-process fabrication methods. These materials present tailorable bandgaps, ambipolar charge transport, long diffusion length of charge carriers, and high defect tolerance, which make them very attractive for efficient photovoltaic solar cells.1–7 PSCs have recently achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.2%,8 attracting much interest from industry to manufacture large area modules and tandem devices.9–11
The light-harvesting perovskite material, with the chemical formula ABX3, commonly refers to a 3D organic–inorganic, hybrid compound in which A is a monovalent cation such as methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3+), formamidinium (FA, CH(NH2)2+), or caesium (Cs+); B is a divalent metal such as lead (Pb2+) or tin (Sn2+); and X is a halide anion, such as bromide (Br−) or iodide (I−). It is possible to combine cations (e.g., adding Cs+ into FAPbI3 or replacing Pb2+ with Sn2+) or anions (e.g., mixing Br− and I−) in the crystal lattice. Due to this composition flexibility, one can tune the bandgap (Eg), making it suitable to single junction solar cells (1.1–1.4 eV) or tandem solar cells (where this material is applied as a top semiconducting layer).12–14 The interest in tandem solar cells (all perovskites, Si-perovskites, and CIGS-perovskites) is due to the possibility of overcoming the Shockley–Queisser limit for single layer cells.15–17 As an example, CsxFA1−xPb(BryI1−y)3 and MAyFA1−yPb(BryI1−y)3 compositions are appealing because of their adjustable bandgap by mixing Cs, MA and FA at the A-site and Br− and I− at the X-site.18,19
To make large-scale application possible, it is essential to control H2O permeation to prevent perovskite degradation. The long-term stability of perovskite solar cells is generally achieved by incorporating H2O barrier layers on the back side of the device. Nevertheless, for solar cells with physical encapsulation, lower PCEs have been reported and further improvement is necessary and intrinsic stability is highly desirable.20–24 The knowledge and control of the intermediates and final products formed during degradation are crucial to propose new strategies to decrease degradation. There are many reports concerning the degradation of MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 films.25–32 A common agreement in the literature is that water plays a catalytic role in the entire degradation process, and PbX2 is the major degradation product. Many degradation routes have been proposed with different intermediates and final products, which, we believe, is a consequence of the diverse conditions that the films are allowed to degrade under.30 Nevertheless, there is still little knowledge regarding the degradation of mixed cation, mixed halide perovskites (CsxFA1−xPb(BryI1−y)3).31
In this work, we describe a systematic investigation of the degradation mechanism of mixed-halide, mixed-cation perovskites (CsxFA1−xPb(BryI1−y)3), where x = 0.10, 0.17 and 0.20 and y = 0.17 and 0.38. These multicomponent films were allowed to degrade under ambient conditions for 60 days and both changes in the morphology and their chemical composition were evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. Our results show that the degradation is influenced by the fraction of bromide and caesium. Furthermore, the degradation of multicomponent perovskites not only converts the perovskite to its precursor materials, but the degradation process passes through several intermediate phases, beginning with transitions to hexagonal perovskite phases prior to hydrated phases. These pathways are different from those of MAPbX3. Further hydration of these phases results in the formation of many compounds such as oxides and carbonates.
Experimental
Precursor solutions
To prepare the precursor solutions, the following chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich: formamidinium iodide (FAI, >98%), caesium iodide (CsI, 99.99%), lead bromide (PbBr2, >98%) and lead iodide (PbI2, 99%), which were dissolved in 1 M solution of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (4:1 DMF:DMSO). The precursor solutions were prepared according to the following composition: CsxFA1−xPb(BryI1−y)3, where x = 0.10, 0.17 or 0.20 and y = 0.17 or 0.38. The films were named depending on the composition (x/y) as follows: 10/17, 17/17, 20/17, 10/38, 17/38 and 20/38.
Film deposition
Glass substrates were soaked in a piranha solution (five parts of concentrated H2SO4 and two parts of H2O2 (30%)) for 10 minutes, and then rinsed, first in water, then in isopropanol and dried under a N2 flow. The perovskite films were then deposited using the solvent engineering method,33 following a two step procedure: 10 s at 1000 rpm and 30 s at 6000 rpm, through spin-coating. The anti-solvent (chlorobenzene) was dropped on the spinning substrate 10 s before the end of the spinning. The films were then annealed at 100 °C for 30 min, in a N2 glove box.
Characterization

In situ GIWAXS measurements were performed at the XRD2 beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS), Campinas, Brazil. The samples were transferred from an inert atmosphere into the GIWAXS chamber. The samples were, then, measured at 0% relative humidity (RH). After 10 min, the chamber was filled with moisture until 40% RH was reached. X-ray scattering was measured for 60 min at this RH, and then the RH was increased to 60%. Again, the samples were measured for 60 min. After that, the RH was turned back to 0% and the scattering was measured for 60 min. The X-ray energy was 7 kV and the scattering signal was collected using a Dectris Pilatus 300k detector with an integration time of 1 s, placed at 190.47 mm from the sample. The angle of incidence of the X-ray beam was set to 3° with an exposure time of 5 s and a sleep time of 25 s. Each GIWAXS image was calibrated using the AgBE standard and azimuthally integrated between 270 and 50° to obtain 1D X-ray diffraction patterns using the fit2D software package. Ex situ GIWAXS was performed at the 11-3 beamline at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) with a photon energy of 12.7 keV, using a Rayonix MX225 CCD detector. The sample was placed in a helium atmosphere during GIWAXS acquisition. Images were calibrated using LaB6 and integrated azimuthally, in a range of 30–150°, to obtain 1D patterns using the Nika software package. The reciprocal lattice maps were recorded using pigyx and py-FAI python libraries.
The morphology of perovskite films was investigated through scanning electron microscopy using a Quanta 250 microscope coupled with a field emission-scanning (FEG-SEM) microscope in which, concomitantly, dispersive energy spectroscopy (EDFS) was performed on the top of the perovskite film. In situ FEG-SEM was performed in environmental mode (FEG-ESEM), maintaining the films inside the microscope chamber at 75% of RH for 5 h.
UV-Vis absorption spectra were obtained with an Agilent Cary 60 Absorption Spectrophotometer by transmitting an open beam of polychromatic light from a Deuterium-Tungsten light source (DH-2000-BAL), operating in the range of 215 nm to 2500 nm.
The perovskite surface composition was also studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) under a reduced pressure of 10−9 Pa with a Scient Omicron ESCA+ spectrometer containing a high-performance hemispheric analyser (EA-125). Monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) was employed as the excitation source. Data analysis was performed in CasaXPS, setting the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV as the reference for calibration.
Results and discussion
The classical ABX3 perovskite structure shows various polytypes depending on the stacking sequence of the close-packed AX3 layers.34 In this work, we use the well-established Ramsdell notation35 to refer to the phases observed in the degradation process, as reported previously in the literature.36 For example, the photoactive α phase is composed of cubic close-packed AX3 layers, resulting in a 3D framework of BX6 corner-sharing octahedra (3C phase). Moreover, the yellow δ phase already observed in lead halide perovskites is composed of a pure hexagonal closed-packed AX3 phase (2H phase). The other two common intermediate phases are composed of a combination of hexagonal and cubic phases (4H and 6H phases), resulting in a 3D framework of both face-sharing and corner-sharing BX6 octahedra.34,37
In order to study the initial stages of degradation in multicomponent perovskite films, in situ grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was carried out under different RH conditions (setup in Fig. 1a). For this study, the compositions 10/17, 20/17, 10/38 and 20/38 were chosen. Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of the fresh samples which exhibit the main perovskite diffraction peaks.

For the fresh samples, the diffraction peaks assigned to the orthorhombic CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 phase at q ∼7 nm−1 are observed for the 20/17 and 20/38 compositions only (Fig. 1d and f). This could be related to the lower solubility of Cs in the precursor solution.38 However, for the 20/17 the intensity of this peak increases up to 60% RH while for the 20/38 the intensity remains constant. Due to the small amount of Cs in the 10/17 sample, this peak appears only at 60% RH and its intensity increases continuously. Interestingly, this peak does not appear for the 10/38 sample under any conditions (Fig. 1e). The formation of CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 is an irreversible process which is evident when the samples are set back again to 0% RH. After one hour at 60% RH, all samples exhibit peaks related to hexagonal phases. The sample 10/17 shows the 4H (q = 8.3 and 9.6 nm−1) and 2H (q = 8.4 nm−1) hexagonal phases, while the sample 20/17 presents only a small signal related to the 4H phase (Fig. 1c and d). For the samples with 38% Br, the formation of intermediates is different. For the sample 20/38 we observe the formation of both hexagonal 6H phases (q ∼ 8.8 nm−1) and hydrated perovskite (q ∼ 8.0 nm−1) simultaneously, independent of the environment. For the 10/38, the hydrated perovskite appears only at 60% RH. We conclude that Cs and Br contents drive the formation of a certain type of hexagonal phase with concomitant formation (or not) of hydrated perovskites.
In addition, we observe an increase in the intensity of the peaks related to the hexagonal phases for all samples except the film with the composition 20/17 (Fig. 1c–f), which is our most stable sample. Another important conclusion here is that the increase of Cs yields more water-tolerant films, as observed in previous reports.39 However, the increase in the Br content accelerates degradation, as seen by the appearance of peaks related to hydrated perovskites in the films with 38% Br (Fig. 1e and f) in the first stages of the degradation process.
The samples were also analysed after the complete degradation. Fig. 2 shows the integrated 1D profiles from ex situ GIWAXS taken after 60 days under ambient conditions. The black phase of the perovskite is, in majority, converted into other phases and products, as evidenced by the dramatic decrease in the intensity of the diffraction peak at q = 10 nm−1 ((100) black-phase perovskite). For all compositions, a peak at q = 7.9 nm−1 emerges after degradation. For methylammonium perovskite, the monohydrate product was reported to form metastable, thin, pale-yellow needles that can undergo further hydration, forming dihydrate crystals.40–42 Hence, we attribute the peak at q = 7.9 nm−1 to the formation of (CsxFA1−x)4Pb(BryI1−y)6·2H2O. This peak is slightly shifted to lower q due to the larger size of the FA cations. Besides, these peaks are quite intense, which is characteristic of these hydrated phases. The dihydrate perovskite can be considered as a network of isolated [PbI6]4− octahedra balanced by surrounding H2O, FA+ and Cs+ cations.43 Additional peaks related to perovskite degradation products were also observed. The two peaks at q = 6.9 and 7.0 nm−1 are the (101) and (002) peaks of orthorhombic CsPb(IxBr1−x)3.44 The sample 10/38 does not present this peak and for samples 17/38 and 20/38, these peaks are shifted to higher q indicating the incorporation of more Br into the structure. The peaks at q = 8.2 and 9.1 nm−1, respectively are attributed to the 4H hexagonal phase.36 The 4H phase is composed of I and Br and the shift of these peaks to higher q is explained by replacement of I by Br.34 The 38% Br samples present well-defined peaks at q = 8.7 and 10.1 nm−1, related to 6H perovskite polytypes (Fig. 2). The hexagonal 6H phase is reported as being a Br-rich phase,34 and this explains why these hexagonal phases are not found in the 17% Br series.36 The 10/17 composition presents unique features, as can be seen by the presence of PbI2, which is not present in the other samples. It seems that the formation of 2H phases (formed exclusively by I) in this composition in the first stages might be related to the presence of more PbI2.40

In situ and ex situ GIWAXS results confirm that the initial stages of the degradation of multicomponent perovskites pass through the formation of the hexagonal phases prior to the hydrated phases. The exception is the 20/38 sample in which both the hexagonal phase (6H) and the hydrated perovskite are found under all ambient conditions investigated. In summary, samples containing 17% of Br pass through 4H and 2H hexagonal phases prior to degradation into hydrated phases. On the other hand, samples with 38% of Br form the phase 6H and hydrated perovskite phases almost simultaneously. This corroborates what was already reported earlier by Dang et al.,34 that Br-rich perovskites present heterogeneous distribution of Br− and I−. Thus, isolated Br-rich regions in pristine perovskites promote the formation of the 6H phase (Br-rich phase). Simultaneously, the I-rich regions become more suitable to incorporate water into the structure, leading to the formation of the hydrated perovskite. Interestingly, we have recently reported through in situ GIWAXS that the initial steps in perovskite film formation also pass through the formation of hexagonal phases and intermediates and that the water content has an important role in directing the formation of these structures.45
For a better understanding of the initial stages of the degradation, we analyse the formation of the hexagonal and hydrated phases by subjecting the samples to in situ FEG-ESEM imaging. In situ FEG-ESEM images were taken during the exposure of the sample 10/17 and 10/38 to a RH of 75% for 5 hours, in order to monitor the degradation reactions (see the videos in the ESI†). To our knowledge, this is the first time that in situ degradation analysis through ESEM has been carried out in perovskite films. Fig. 3a–g show screenshots of each hour of humidity exposure during the ESEM imaging of the sample 10/17. Film wrinkling is observed in all fresh samples and it has been assigned to mechanical stress during the formation of crystalline intermediates and their subsequent conversion to black phase perovskites.46 Complete degradation was achieved after 5 h of exposure and it occurred mainly in the electron beam exposed area. Secondary electrons generated at the sample surface collide and ionize water molecules as they are accelerated towards a positively biased gaseous secondary electron detector. The ionization of water causes a cascade of reactions and the positively charged ions (HxO+) are accelerated towards the sample surface counterbalancing the charge and, in the case of perovskite samples, reacting with it, increasing the degradation rate of the area exposed to the electron beam. We saw that the degradation has its beginning in the “valleys” of the wrinkled film. We believe that this is related to the presence of smaller perovskite grains at the “valleys” compared to the “hills”, as we can see in the cross-section SEM images (Fig. S8†). Furthermore, for the sample 10/17, at about 1 hour of exposure, few grains start to coalesce (Fig. 3b). We assigned these structures to the hexagonal phases (4H and 2H), consistent with the in situ GIWAXS results. After 2 hours, we observe the formation of needle-like structures (Fig. 3c), previously assigned in the literature to hydrated perovskites.31,32,43 It is important to point out that our assumptions were based on the fact that both in situ GiWAXS and SEM track degradation with time. It is therefore necessary to perform further analyses to confirm our findings.

For the sample 10/38 (Fig. S9†), the hydration and the hexagonal phases begin to appear almost at the same time (Fig. S9 and ESI Videos†). In addition, the degradation starts faster compared to the sample 10/17. The first degradation products begin to appear 15 min after contact with the humid atmosphere (Fig. S9b†). In addition, the complete hydration of the perovskite occurs within 2 hours. These results agree with the in situ GIWAXS data that more Br causes much higher instability in the perovskite films. As the control experiment, the same procedure but now in high-vacuum mode was carried out to avoid the influence of humidity. Fig. S10 and the ESI Videos† show that the electron beam does not degrades the sample in the same manner as the humidity inside the microscope chamber.
SEM images, before and after degradation, were also obtained to track the change in morphology with time. Comparing Fig. S11a (fresh) and b† (aged under ambient conditions), we observe that the morphology, shape, and contour of the grains are completely different. Besides, after degradation, there is coalescence of the grains associated with the formation of other phases and products, as expected due to the very unstable nature of the perovskite towards moisture. Samples with 17% of Br present needle-like structures. These structures have already been observed previously30,47 and have been assigned to hydrated perovskites. We could not find any compositional inhomogeneity, on a length scale of 50 μm, in the perovskite layer by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. S12 and S13†).
Changes in the colour and absorption profile directly confirm the decomposition of the perovskite structure after prolonged ambient exposure (Fig. 4a–f). The UV-vis spectra of the fresh samples show the characteristic absorption onset at ∼765 nm for 17% Br- and ∼710 nm for 38% Br-based perovskites, corresponding to their optical band gap, Eg = 1.62 eV and Eg = 1.75 eV, respectively. The increase in the band gap is caused by the higher content of Br and Cs in the perovskite structure.48 We notice that a more abrupt visual change starts to appear on the second day and the films are entirely degraded after 20 days. For samples with 17% of Br, on day 2, the onset shifts to higher wavelengths and a broad absorption band appears around 550 nm, related to the presence of hexagonal phases.36 On day 3, the samples 17/17 and 20/17 present an absorption band at 500 nm (4H phase) that evolves to a broad absorption band at ∼650 nm, between 5 and 10 days, related to remaining of the 3C phase original absorption band.36 The sample 10/17 behaves slightly different: there is a gradual increase in the onset until it reaches the characteristic absorption of the 2H phase (∼465 nm).36 For samples with 38% Br, on day 2, two distinct absorption bands appear at ∼525 nm and ∼465 nm, associated with 6H and 4H phases, respectively. For the samples 10/38 and 17/38, these bands are present until day 10, while for the sample 20/38 they last until day 3. After day 10, a new broad absorption band appears at ∼850 nm, related to scattering from film irregularities.36

XPS can provide additional information about the surface composition of the perovskite films and, thus, help us to establish the products formed by the action of moisture and oxygen that could not be detected by XRD (i.e. amorphous phases). The XPS survey spectra of all the samples studied in this work can be found in Fig. S14a–f.† A pronounced increase in the O 1s (532 eV) and C 1s (284 eV) relative peak intensities and a decrease in the I 3d (620 eV) peak intensity after degradation are observed. In the next paragraphs a more complete analysis will be provided based on the deconvolution of the signals for the elements C, O, Pb, I, Cs, and Br, taken before and after degradation. The Br 3d, I 3d, Cs 3d and Pb 4f high-resolution XPS spectra of the fresh samples are shown in Fig. S15–S18.† The C 1s and O 1s high-resolution XPS spectra (before and after degradation) are presented in Fig. S19 and S20,† respectively.

Fig. 5a and b show the comparison of Br 3d and I 3d core-level XPS spectra, respectively, for samples containing 17% and 38% Br, after 60 days of degradation under ambient conditions. We observe a wider profile in the spectra from degraded samples, which indicates the existence of more chemical components. The electrons with lower binding energies (blue) can be attributed to Br in hexagonal phases and CsPb(IxBr1−x)3,49 whereas the other component (orange) can be associated with other degradation products such as (CsxFA1−x)4Pb(BryI1−y)6·2H2O.50,51 For the sample 10/17, the I 3d peaks are wider and a third component (green) was used to fit the results, which is related to I− in PbI2 (Fig. 5b), in agreement with previous analyses.52,53 Br 3d XPS for all samples presents a more significant contribution (measured using the relative integrated intensities) from the components related to the hexagonal phases (Fig. 5a – blue). On the other hand, the I 3d XPS has more contribution from the component related to hydrated perovskites and other degradation products (Fig. 5b – orange). This indicates that the hydrated perovskites are I-rich species, in contrast with the hexagonal phases, corroborating our in situ GIWAXS and ESEM experiments. It is important to point out that, with concomitant increase in the amount of Cs in the sample, the Br 3d and I 3d XPS bands related to hydrated phases decrease for samples with 17% of Br. In contrast with the samples with 38% of Br, where the opposite behaviour occurs. This result is in agreement with in situ XRD results, where an increase in the stability was found for compositions with higher Cs and less Br contents (Table S2†).

The ratios between the deconvoluted areas are presented in Table S2.† 
The perovskite A-site was studied using the Cs 3d XPS spectrum (Fig. 6a and S17†). After degradation (Fig. 6a), the Cs 3d peaks are slightly shifted to higher energies and also present a wider profile due to many components. Cs 3d XPS spectra were fitted with two components for all samples. The one, at the lower binding energy, is related to the Cs in the CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 phase (blue); this phase is expected to be formed as it is thermodynamically more stable under ambient conditions.44,54,55 The other (orange) can be associated with the Cs in the hydrated perovskite species and also with CsOH.36,50 Again, the sample 10/38 did not present a peak related to CsPb(IxBr1−x)3, indicating that the Cs is in (CsxFA1−x)4Pb(BryI1−y)6·2H2O and other degradation products.50
 Fig. 6  High resolution XPS analysis. (a) After degradation high resolution XPS Cs 3d core-level spectra of all samples – deconvolution peaks are attributed to Cs electrons in (CsxFA1−x)4Pb(BryI1−y)6·2H2O and, also, CsOH (orange), in CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 phases (blue) and, for the sample 10/38, to Cs in other degradation subproducts such as CsX and CsOH (green); (b) high resolution XPS Pb 4f core level spectra of samples, after degradation – the deconvolutions are attributed to (CsxFA1−x)4Pb(BryI1−y)6·2H2O, hexagonal phases, Pb(OH)2 (blue), PbCO3 (orange), CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 (purple), and PbO (green). 
The Pb 4f peaks broaden after several days of sample storage under ambient conditions, extending to both lower and higher binding energies Fig. 6b. The main feature (blue), in the middle, is related to halide rich hydrated species, Pb(OH)2, and also to the Pb cations in the dihydrate perovskite.56–58 The component at lower energies (green) can be related to Pb(II) oxide (PbO) formation.28 The component at higher energies (orange) can be related to CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 and the hexagonal phases described before. At last, we observe a small contribution at even higher binding energies, that can be assigned to lead carbonate (PbCO3).56–58 It has been reported in the literature that, in contact with water, Pb2+ ions in perovskite films may be converted to Pb(OH)2 and, then, to PbO.28 Also, the reaction of one of the degradation products with CO2 and O2, in light, can lead to the formation of PbCO3.59,60 The asymmetry towards higher energies, more evident for the sample 10/17, may be due to the contribution of the lead iodide signal.26 The sample 17/38 presents a dissonant behaviour: a wider profile for both higher and lower energies, suggesting that more PbO and hydrated perovskites are present in the degradation products.28,61
Carbon and oxygen are always present in samples exposed to the atmosphere, either because of incidental contamination or oxidation and water incorporation. The high-resolution XPS spectra of O 1s and C 1s electrons are shown in Fig. S19 and S19,† respectively. The C 1s component located at the lower binding energy, 284.8 eV, (Fig. S19†) is related to C–H from ex situ absorbed hydrocarbon contamination.52 The peak area increases significantly after degradation. At 286 and 288 eV contributions from electrons of the C–N bond62,63 and from the conjugated N–CN carbon of the formamidinium ion can be found.62,63 At last, the signal at ∼289 eV is attributed to CO/C–O.26,61,64 The features in the O 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. S20†) at 532.2 and 533.5 eV confirm the CO/C–O bonds observed in the C 1s spectrum. The component at a higher energy (533.5 eV) is derived from metal hydroxides, that can be lead(II) hydroxide (Pb(OH)2),28,65 and the other (532.2 eV), originated from the C–O/CO bond in PbCO3, overlapping with features related to water in the hydrated perovskite lattice, which explains, also, the size of this Gaussian component.28,66 The component at 530.5 eV in the O 1s XPS spectrum is attributed to PbO, corroborating the Pb 4f XPS results.28,66 We observe, further, other small features at about 536 eV, related to water absorbed by the perovskite film.
The decrease in the I/Pb and Br/Pb ratios (Fig. S21a and b†) suggests a loss of iodine and bromine during the degradation process. Analysing the results summarized in Table S3,† the ratio [Br + I]/Pb decreases almost to half of the initial value. This indicates that part of the halides is lost in the degradation processes. The ratio ([Br + I]/Pb) value is much lower than the expected value considering only the hydration products. This corroborates our findings of other degradation products such as PbO, Pb(OH)2 and PbCO3. Similar behaviour is found for the (Br 3d + I 3d)/Cs 3d area ratio (Table S3†). Here, we observe a decrease in the Cs content almost to the same extent of the halides (Fig. S21c and d†). This can be associated with the higher mobility of Cs and halides in water.67,68
In summary, for perovskites containing 17% of Br, the degradation mechanism passes, necessarily, through 4H and 2H hexagonal phases. On the other hand, the perovskites with 38% of Br pass simultaneously through hexagonal phases and hydrated structures. When the hydrated perovskites are then formed, other reactions take place, due to the higher amount of water in these structures. Consequently, different degradation products are formed. Evolution of HI and HBr is expected to shift the reaction equilibrium in the direction of the products, promoting the formation of metal hydroxides (Pb(OH)2 and CsOH), oxides (PbO), and carbonates (PbCO3). The possible reaction mechanisms and the products formed are depicted in (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Scheme of the possible perovskite degradation pathways, depending on the initial composition. We note that, with a less amount of Br, the perovskite passes through 4H and 2H phases before forming the hydrated perovskite. On the other hand, the perovskites with a higher Br content can form both the phase 6H and the hydrated perovskite simultaneously. 
Conclusions
In this work the degradation mechanisms of mixed-cation perovskite films with different stoichiometries (CsxFA1−xPb(BryI1−y)3) were investigated by in situ, structural and surface techniques. Our study presents new findings on how mixed-halide and mixed-cation perovskites can degrade when exposed to ambient conditions. We tracked the initial stages of perovskite degradation using in situ ESEM and GIWAXS. The compositions with 17% of Br begin to degrade with the formation of hexagonal phases (2H and 4H) and, then, hydration starts to occur. For perovskites with 38% of Br, the formation of the 6H hexagonal phase and hydration occur almost simultaneously due to the heterogeneity of the Br and I distribution in the film. In situ FEG-ESEM images obtained in a chamber at 75% of RH were obtained for the first time to track visually the beginning of degradation. It was possible to visualize that the hexagonal phases start to appear at the “valleys” of the wrinkled morphology presented by these films, likely related to the smaller grain size in these parts of the film. After the initial stages, the reactions led to the formation of other products (hydroxides, oxides and carbonates) due to the evolution of halide gases, independent of the initial composition.
Additionally, we observed that higher fractions of Cs increase the stability, while higher Br fractions have the opposite effect and are detrimental to stability. Our findings provide guidance for selecting the best compositions, type of protective layers (e.g. when applying these films as a top layer in tandem solar cells) and postconditioning procedures for perovskite thin films.
Another highly important aspect of this work is the recycling of devices that are no longer functional. Given the fact that many companies have started the PSC business, the adequate management/recycling of these devices after usage is of critical relevance.69 And for the correct disposal, our investigation provides detailed information about the final products as a consequence of the complete degradation of multicomponent perovskites.

(a) After degradation high resolution XPS Br 3d core level spectra of all samples – deconvolution peaks are attributed to hexagonal phases, CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 (blue), (CsxFA1−x)4Pb(BryI1−y)6·2H2O and other degradation products (orange); (b) after degradation high resolution XPS I 3d core-level spectra of all samples – deconvolution peaks are attributed to hexagonal phases, CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 (blue), (CsxFA1−x)4Pb(BryI1−y)6·2H2O (orange), and PbI2 (green). The ratios between the deconvoluted areas are presented in Table S2.†	 

 	Fig. 6  High resolution XPS analysis. (a) After degradation high resolution XPS Cs 3d core-level spectra of all samples – deconvolution peaks are attributed to Cs electrons in (CsxFA1−x)4Pb(BryI1−y)6·2H2O and, also, CsOH (orange), in CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 phases (blue) and, for the sample 10/38, to Cs in other degradation subproducts such as CsX and CsOH (green); (b) high resolution XPS Pb 4f core level spectra of samples, after degradation – the deconvolutions are attributed to (CsxFA1−x)4Pb(BryI1−y)6·2H2O, hexagonal phases, Pb(OH)2 (blue), PbCO3 (orange), CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 (purple), and PbO (green).	 

 	Fig. 7  Scheme of the possible perovskite degradation pathways, depending on the initial composition. We note that, with a less amount of Br, the perovskite passes through 4H and 2H phases before forming the hydrated perovskite. On the other hand, the perovskites with a higher Br content can form both the phase 6H and the hydrated perovskite simultaneously.
