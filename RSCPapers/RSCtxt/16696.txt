    , Accepted 28th June 2021First published on 28th June 2021AbstractGraphitic carbon nitrides have CO2 photoreduction ability, but their activities are limited by the low potential and mobility of photogenerated carriers. Herein, ultrathin mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (CNNS) synchronously decorated with functional cyano groups and nitrogen vacancies were prepared by a facile molten salt route. The CNNS presented unprecedentedly excellent gas-phase CO2 photoreduction performance under visible light irradiation without any co-catalyst or a sacrificial agent, and have a CH4-yielding rate of 23.0 μmol g−1 h−1 and a selectivity of 97.9%. This boosted performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of cyano group decoration, abundant nitrogen vacancies and extremely high surface area, which improve electron storage, charge carrier mobility, CO2 affinity, and optimize the energy band structure. This work demonstrates that a structural optimization combined with defect design of carbon nitride framework is a powerful approach to improve the photocatalytic activity, providing an accessible way to design highly efficient carbon-based photocatalysts.
Introduction
The increasing usage of fossil fuels and the large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have caused a global energy crisis and greenhouse effect. Reducing CO2 into organic fuels is regarded as a propitious way to simultaneously alleviate corresponding environmental and energy problems.1–4 However, the reduction of CO2 is difficult to be achieved under mild conditions due to the high bond dissociation energy (127 kcal mol−1) for the cleavage of the C–O bond and the formation of the C–H bond. Fortunately, photocatalytic reactions provide a sustainable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly route to reduce CO2 using various semiconductor (e.g. metal oxides,5,6 sulfides,7 phosphides,8 and metal-free polymers9,10) photocatalyst, which can convert solar energy into chemical energy and decrease the activation barrier of the reaction. Among these photocatalysts, graphitic carbon nitrides (CN) have attracted extensive attention owing to their strong reduction ability, visible-light-responsiveness, easy fabrication and high chemical stability.11–14
However, pristine bulk CN (denoted as BCN) has a low CO2 conversion rate due to its low surface area (below 10 m2 g−1), insufficient visible light absorption (below 460 nm), high electron–hole recombination rate, and few active sites for interfacial reactions. Compared to BCN, two-dimensional (2D) CN nanosheets possess a more abundant surface active sites and shorter diffusion paths for the photogenerated carriers, thus 2D CN exhibits improved photocatalytic activity.15,16 Nevertheless, one open problem associated with 2D CN is their apparently wider bandgap from the strong quantum size effect, so that 2D CN nanosheets synthesized by a traditional method usually suffer from poor capability to absorb the wide-spectrum visible light and thus show poor visible-light photocatalytic activity.17,18
To solve this problem, many strategies have been used to tune electronic structures of 2D CN, such as doping with a heteroatom,19,20 crystallizing,21,22 and introducing carbon or nitrogen-vacancy defects.13,23 Among these, the introduction of nitrogen vacancies can not only narrow the band gap to enhance visible light harvesting but also trap photoexcited electrons to inhibit the recombination of electron–hole pairs. Moreover, the decoration with cyano groups can harvest visible light and efficiently separate photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which are generated by replacing amines upon structure termination.24 The introduction of nitrogen vacancies and cyano groups into the CN structure usually needs a high temperature (about 600 °C),25 a reducing atmosphere (e.g. H2, NH3),26 or an alkali-assisted route.27 However, most of the above approaches require complex procedures, high-cost reagents, as well as high energy consumption, limiting their practical applications. Therefore, the development of an alternative simple approach is still desirable to modify the electronic structure and optimize the photocatalytic performance.
In the present work, ultrathin mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (denoted as CNNS) with cyano groups and nitrogen vacancies were prepared via a facile molten salt route. In contrast to BCN, the as-synthesized CNNS photocatalyst demonstrates superior photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity with a CH4-yielding rate of 22.9 μmol g−1 h−1 and a selectivity of 97.9% under visible light irradiation in a gas phase. This promising performance was attributed to its 2D mesoporous nanosheet structure, high surface area, abundant nitrogen vacancies and cyano groups, which improve electron storage, charge carrier mobility, CO2 affinity, and optimize the energy band structure.
Results and discussion
Graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets with cyano groups and nitrogen vacancies were synthesized via the direct polycondensation of dicyandiamide through a one-step ionothermal process; LiBr-KCl eutectic mixture served as a molten salt medium (Fig. 1a). XRD patterns of the obtained BCN and CNNS are shown in Fig. 1b. Two diffraction peaks in BCN were observed at 27.8° and 13.3° (2θ). The former can be assigned to the characteristic interplanar stacking of conjugated aromatic units (002), and the latter corresponds to the in-plane tri-s-triazine units (100).28 Compared with BCN, CNNS showed no XRD peak shift. In sharp contrast, a broader diffraction peak of the (002) plane emerged, and the intensity significantly decreased, clearly demonstrating the destroyed long-range order in atomic arrangements after the molten salt synthesis procedure. As reported in our previous work, salt ionic liquid wrapped on carbon nitride surface layers reduces the interlayer-binding strength, suppresses the coalescent and facilitates the formation of nanosheets.29 However, the diffraction peak at around 13.3° remained, indicating that the planar atomic structure had been preserved. As observed in an SEM image (Fig. 1c), the morphology of CNNS revealed a two-dimensional (2D) pleated flake structure. A TEM image (Fig. 1d) verified the presence of a porous nanosheet structure. The nanosheet morphology of CNNS was further confirmed using AFM (Fig. 1e). A large number of nanosheets with a lateral size of several microns were displayed. The average thickness of the nanosheets was about 4.3 nm (Fig. 1f and inset). The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of CNNS and BCN are shown in Fig. 1g. CNNS exhibits a typical IV isotherm, assigned to the existence of mesopores. Compared with BCN, CNNS revealed a much higher BET surface area of 512.6 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 1.72 cm3 g−1 (Table S1†). The Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) analysis shows that CNNS possessed more abundant mesopores than BCN. The higher surface area of CNNS may originate from their 2D nanosheet morphology and a large number of mesopores. The 2D nanosheet with abundant mesopores should result in high-efficiency photocatalytic performance because of plentiful reaction sites.30

FTIR spectra were recorded to characterize the chemical functional groups of the as-synthesized CNNS and BCN (Fig. 2a). The broad bands at 3000–3700 cm−1 can be attributed to N–H and O–H stretching vibrations, which were assigned to residual amino groups and absorbed H2O.31 The stronger intensity of the O–H stretching peak in CNNS may be due to the larger specific surface area and thus the adsorption of more water on their surface, while the N–H stretching peak decreased. A new peak at 2173 cm−1 corresponded to the asymmetric tensile vibration of the CN triple bond in cyano groups presented in CNNS, which were reported to increase the off-domain of electrons, adjust the energy band structure, and facilitate the separation of carriers.32 Strong vibration bands at 1200–1700 cm−1 and 810 cm−1 were assigned to the stretching vibrations of CN heterocyclic units and the s-triazine rings, respectively.33

XPS was performed to further validate the chemical composition and chemical state of BCN and CNNS. BCN and CNNS were mainly composed of C, N, and O elements (Fig. S1a, Table S2†). The high-resolution C 1s XPS spectra presented four peaks, as shown in Fig. 2b. The first one located at 284.6 eV was for sp2 C–C bonds, which were attributed to the standard reference carbon signal. The binding energy peaks at 288.2, 285.5 and 286.2 eV were assigned to the sp2-hybridized carbon bonded to nitrogen in aromatic ring N–CN, C–NHx on the edges of heptazine rings, and CN bonds, respectively.34,35It is interesting that the 286.2 eV (CN) signal was intensified and the 285.5 eV (C–NHx) signal was reduced in comparison with BCN, evidencing that the cyano groups were formed in CNNS by replacing the –NHx (as seen by FTIR). Fig. 2c shows the high-resolution N 1s spectra. The peaks at 398.6 and 400.8 eV were obtained for both samples, which were ascribed to CN–C and NHx species.36 A new peak centered at 400.2 eV referring to nitrogen in CN appeared in CNNS. The peaks from CNNS and BCN referring to tri-coordinated N–(C)3 were centered at 399.3 and 399.5 eV, respectively. Such reduced binding energy of nitrogen in N–(C)3 was derived from the structural changes induced by cyano groups.37 Moreover, it is worth noting that the CN–C and N–(C)3 ratio of CNNS was 0.3, lower than that of BCN (Table 1), implying the loss of two-coordinated N and the formation of nitrogen vacancies on the surface. Meanwhile, the intensity of the NHx signal for CNNS decreased, agreeing with the C 1s spectra. The high-resolution XPS O 1 s presented two peaks (Fig. S1†) corresponding to H2O (532.1 eV) and O2 (530.8 eV), which arose from adsorbed water and air. Furthermore, according to the elemental analysis, the C/N atomic ratio of CNNS (0.73) is higher than that of BCN (0.68) (Table S1†), further confirming the presence of nitrogen vacancies. More amounts of H and O in CNNS may come from the adsorbed water. Based on the above results, the as-synthesized CNNS possessed a triazine-based structure with abundant cyano groups and nitrogen vacancies were formed during the procedure of molten salt synthesis.

Such optimizations of morphology and structure can be expected to promote the optical properties and photogenerated charge separation. The UV-Vis diffuse-reflectance spectra (DRS) and corresponding Kubelka–Munk diagram of BCN and CNNS are shown in Fig. 3a and b. The absorption band at 445 nm was obtained for BCN, which was attributed to π–π* overlapped electron transition in the conjugated aromatic C3N4 ring,38 while the CNNS had a band edge at 413 nm. From the Kubelka–Munk diagram, the band gap energies (Eg) of BCN and CNNS were 2.79 and 3.00 eV, respectively, indicating an obvious blue shift of 0.21 eV for CNNS. This wider bandgap was due to the quantum size effect of the smaller nanostructure.39 Moreover, the Urbach tail edge of CNNS presented an obvious bathochromic shift, corresponding to the UV-vis DRS spectra. Urbach energy (Eu) was calculated to be 0.18 and 0.53 eV for BCN and CNNS, respectively (Fig. 3b inset). As reported, the Urbach tail is associated with the midgap states that originated from the nitrogen-vacancy defects.40 This resulted in smaller transition energy (Et) from the valence band (VB) position to the midgap states for CNNS, so that the photoexcited electrons can be more easily transformed from VB to midgap states.41 The XPS valence band spectra of BCN and CNNS are shown in Fig. 3c. It can be seen that Fermi levels above VB maximum were 2.04 and 2.13 eV for BCN and CNNS, respectively. The VB edge position can be determined using the formula EVB = Φ − Evac + Efv, where Φ is the work function with a value of 3.88 eV for carbon nitride, Evac is a constant of 4.44 eV, referring to the energy of free electrons in the hydrogen scale, and Efv is the difference between the Fermi level and VB maximum.42 The VB potentials of BCN and CNNS were calculated to be 1.48 and 1.57 eV, respectively. The more positive VB potential for CNNS suggested a stronger oxidation potential, facilitating the oxidation of H2O to generate H+. Based on the band gap, the conduction band (CB) potentials of BCN and CNNS were determined as −1.31 and −1.43 eV, respectively. The band structure alignments for BCN and CNNS shown in Fig. 3d are based on the experimental results. Compared with BCN, the wider bandgap and deeper midgap state of CNNS can endow the carbon nitride framework with more accommodated charge carriers and kinetic advantage for photogenerated carriers.

To study the recombination behavior of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of BCN and CNNS were first investigated, as shown in Fig. 4a. CNNS exhibited a blue-shifted emission peak at 415 nm, in accordance with the bandgap, and a remarkable decrease in the PL intensity compared with BCN (peak at about 450 nm), indicating non-radiative recombination paths for the photogenerated electron–hole pairs owing to nitrogen vacancies and functional cyano groups.43 The time-resolved photoluminescence decay (TRPD) spectra of CNNS and BCN are shown in Fig. 4b. It can be seen that the fluorescence attenuation of CNNS was slower than that of BCN. The average fluorescence lifetime (τav) of CNNS (5.87 ns) was 1.4 times more than that of BCN (4.20 ns), suggesting a higher photogenerated charge separation rate of CNNS. The prolonged photoelectron lifetime by CNNS may stem from the electron-withdrawing property of cyano groups.37 According to the TRPD analysis, the fast decay component (τ1, A1 51.1%) was dominant for BCN, indicating direct recombination of the exciton. However, the slow decay component (τ2, A2 63.4%) was dominant for CNNS, suggesting the indirect recombination of exciton in CNNS. The improved indirect recombination may originate from nitrogen vacancies, which is also beneficial to extend the carrier lifetime owing to its longer recombination path along trapping-detrapping-recombination.44

The results were further verified by room-temperature EPR spectra. As shown in Fig. S2,† Lorentzian lines from unpaired electrons in BCN were almost invisible. The intensity of the ESR signal noticeably increased in CNNS, owing to the high concentration of delocalized electrons on the sp2-hybridized atoms of the π-conjugated aromatic C3N4 rings of CNNS. It has been reported that the enhanced concentration of delocalized electrons can be derived from nitrogen-vacancy defects and strong electron-withdrawing cyano groups.36,37,45 The enhanced charge migration was further demonstrated by the smaller radius on the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots and higher photocurrent density of CNNS than those of BCN (Fig. 4c and d), which indicated a lower electron-transport resistance and a more efficient tapping of photogenerated electrons of CNNS.46,47
CO2 photoreduction experiments for BCN and CNNS were performed in a visible-light-driven (λ ≥ 420 nm) reaction vessel for 5 h. The product of CO2 reduction on BCN was only CO, with a yield of 5.5 μmol g−1 (Fig. 5a). However, CO and CH4 were steadily produced over CNNS with CH4 as the predominant product. The yield of CH4 was 115.0 μmol g−1 and CO was 9.7 μmol g−1 with corresponding CH4 and CO yielding rate were 23.0 μmol g−1 h−1 and 1.9 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively (Fig. 5b and c), show the high CO2 reduction activity for CNNS. According to the number of electrons required for the CO2 reduction reaction, the selectivity of CH4 production is defined as [8 k(CH4)]/[8 k(CH4) + 2 k(CO)] × 100%, where k(gas) is the yielding rate of product gas. CNNS possessed a CH4 selectivity of 97.9%, which indicates the high CH4 production selectivity in this cocatalyst-free and sacrificial agent-free photoreduction CO2 reaction system. Moreover, under illumination of light with λ ≥ 200 nm, CNNS also presented higher photocatalytic activity (CH4: 50.8 μmol g−1 h−1, CO: 5.1 μmol g−1 h−1) than that of BCN (CO: 2.6 μmol g−1 h−1), as shown in Fig. S3.† The CO2 photoreduction performance of the photocatalyst was better than that of many reported photocatalysts (Table S3†). In addition, O2 production was also detected during the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. S4†), which is the product of H2O oxidation by holes and is needed to close the photoredox cycle. To identify the carbon source of the resulting products, Ar was used as a substitute for CO2 to carry out the same experiment. No generated CO and CH4 were detected, indicating that the photocatalytic products were indeed originating from CO2. To test the stability of CNNS, the catalyst was reused in a fresh reaction mixture for five cyclic operations. As shown in Fig. 5d, there was no significant attenuation in the production of CO and CH4 for the CO2 conversion system. The results indicated that the as-synthesized CNNS revealed excellent photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance and selectively boosted the CO2 conversion into CH4.

The adsorption of CO2 plays a primarily important role in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction process, which depends on the affinity between the photocatalyst surface and CO2 molecules. The CO2 adsorption performance was measured and the data is shown in Fig. 6a. CNNS showed a noticeably increased CO2 uptake, the maximal amount at 760 mmHg were 2.03 and 0.95 cm3 g−1 for CNNS and BCN, respectively. The doubled CO2 adsorption capacity of CNNS arose from their higher specific surface area and developed mesoporous volume. The CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) measurement was performed to investigate the CO2 adsorption behavior of as-synthesized samples (Fig. 6b). The peaks at 115 °C of BCN and 175 °C of CNNS related to the desorption of CO2 adsorbed physically, and the higher desorption temperature of CNNS indicated the firmer absorption of CO2 molecules on the surface. Notably, the peak intensity of CNNS at 380 °C derived from basic sites was very high, implying the strong CO2 chemical adsorption ability of CNNS. In contrast, no CO2 chemisorption peak can be identified from BCN. These results suggested that CNNS can effectively adsorb CO2 molecules, thereby promoting the photoreduction efficiency. It is understood that CO2 adsorption leads to the formation of partially charged species CO2δ− through interactions with surface atoms.48 In the CO2 molecule, each oxygen atom acted as an electron donor and has a lone pair of electrons, and carbon atoms can accept electrons from Lewis base centers. The unsaturated carbon atoms around nitrogen defects could form a co-ordinate bond with electron-pair donors, promoting the trapping of CO2. Moreover, the formed cyano groups probably capture CO2 since nitrogen atoms with an unbonded electron pair could endow the CNNS with Lewis base functionality. Nitrogen vacancy defects and cyano groups in CNNS can lead to extended delocalization of the π-conjugated system and thus change the intrinsic surface electronic property.45,49 Subsequently, CNNS presented the enhancement of interaction with CO2 molecules.
 Fig. 6  CO2 adsorption isotherms (a) and CO2-TPD profiles (b) of BCN and CNNS. 
To further elucidate the enhancement of photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance and high selectivity for CH4 production, we investigated adsorption energies of reactants (CO2 and H2O) and products (CO and CH4) based on density functional theory (DFT) (Fig. 7 and S5†). Compared with pristine carbon nitride, the calculated adsorption energies (Eads) of CO2 and H2O on CNNS were more negative, indicating a higher adsorption affinity of CNNS toward the reactants, which are in accordance with the above CO2 adsorption results (Fig. 6a and b) and XPS results (Fig. S1 and Table S1†). The Eads is improved by introducing nitrogen-vacancy defects and cyano groups, which could facilitate the activation of reactants.50 It is well known that CO generation is a two-electron reaction (eqn (1) and (3)), which should be easier to reach than the eight-electron-involved CH4 generation (eqn (2) and (3)). Moreover, the adsorption energy of CO on pristine carbon nitride was calculated to be 11.1 kJ mol−1, thus the CO product is easily desorbed from BCN. However, due to the stronger interaction between CO molecules and CNNS (Eads (CO) = −3.2 kJ mol−1), the escape of *CO for the generation of CO gas is suppressed, and the following protonation of *CO is promoted to boost the generation of CH4.51 Furthermore, CH4 molecules can be readily released from CNNS surface during the CO2 reduction since its Eads (CH4) is 1.0 kJ mol−1. CO2 + 2e− + 2H+ → CO + H2O(1) CO2 + 8e− + 8H+ → CH4 + 2H2O(2) H2O + 2h+ → 2H++1/2O2(3)
 Fig. 7  Adsorption energies of CO2, H2O, CO, and CH4 on BCN and CNNS. 
Based on the aforementioned results, the mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance of CNNS may be proposed as following (Fig. 8): (1) ultrathin nanosheet morphology and mesoporous structure endued CNNS with a widened bandgap, strengthened redox ability of photoexcited charge carriers, high surface area, and a more active sites for CO2 reduction; (2) with functional cyano group decoration and nitrogen-vacancy defects, a deeper midgap state was induced in CNNS, and the radiative recombination of the photoexcited electron–hole pairs and electron-transport resistance was restrained; (3) the reactants (CO2 and H2O) adsorption and the affinity of CNNS toward CO were simultaneously promoted, facilitating the photocatalytic reaction and CH4 selectivity. Consequently, the favorable characteristics gave this material the prominent CO2 photocatalytic performance and CH4 selectivity.

Conclusions
In summary, mesoporous ultrathin graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (CNNS) with functional cyano group decoration and nitrogen vacancy defects were prepared by a facile molten salt route. The as-synthesized CNNS possessed excellent gas-phase CO2 photoreduction performance and high selectivity for CH4 production without any cocatalyst or sacrificial agent. Based on the comprehensive experiments results and theoretical calculations, the superior photocatalytic performance of CNNS stemmed from larger surface area, optimized energy band structure, enhanced electron transport ability, prolonged lifetime of photoexcited charge carrie, and improved reactants binding affinity. The facile synthesis route and outstanding CO2 photocatalysis performance in this work provide a novel way on the design of high-efficiency and high-selectivity carbon-based photocatalysts.
Experimental method
Sample preparation
BCN was prepared by calcination of melamine at 500 °C for 3 h in an air atmosphere. The obtained product was ground into powders in a mortar for further characterization.
CNNS were prepared in a molten salt medium. Typically, 1 g dicyandiamide was used as precursor, and the eutectic mixture of LiBr/KCl (75: 25 mass ratio, melting point: 263 °C) was used as the salt medium. Dicyandiamide and the salt medium with the mass ratio of 1: 80 were ground to be well mixed and then put into an alumina crucible with a lid and heated at 500 °C for 3 h in an air atmosphere. After the furnace was cooled to room temperature, the resulting product was taken out and repeatedly washed with distilled water to remove the salt medium. The product powders were placed in a refrigerator freezer at −18 °C and freeze-dried by a vacuum freeze dryer for 24 h prior to further characterization.
Sample characterization
An X-ray diffractometer (XRD, X'Pert Pro, Philips, Netherlands) was used to check the phases of the product. A Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (VERTEX 70, Germany) was used to characterize the functional groups in products, and samples were tested by embedding them in KBr pellets. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a VG Multilab 2000 instrument (Thermo Electron Co., USA). Elemental analysis was performed on an Elementar Vario EL III microanalyzer (EA, Germany). A scanning electron microscope (SEM, Novo 400, FEI Co., USA) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, 2000F, Jeol Ltd, Japan) were used to check the morphologies of products. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a Nanoscope MultiMode V instrument (Keysight SPM 6500, USA) under the ScanAsyst Air mode. The sample powders were directly sprinkled on conductive carbon adhesive tapes for SEM. In order to obtain more details of the morphology, the sample was dispersed in ethanol for 30 min by sonication and then dropped on copper microgrid and mica plate substrate for TEM and AFM measurements, respectively. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption was measured at 77 K on an automatic surface area and pore size analyzer (Autosorb-1, USA), all samples were degassed at 393 K for 3 h before measurements, and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was calculated according to the adsorption isotherm. The adsorption properties for CO2 were measured on an Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimetry System (Micromeritics ASAP 2020, USA) at 25 °C and the samples were degassed at 300 °C for 3 h prior to measurement. The CO2-TPD was recorded on a catalyst analyzer (CAT-B, BEL, Japan). A UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600, Japan) was used to obtain the light absorption properties of samples. Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved transient PL decay curves were measured respectively by using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FL3-32, Horiba Jobin–Yvon, French) and an FLS920 fluorescence lifetime spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK). EPR spectra were measured on an ESR spectrometer (MEX-nano, Bruker) with a modulation frequency of 100 kHz and a microwave power of 35 mW.
Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the CASTEP Package. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was applied as the exchange–correlation function. For geometry optimization, the energy cutoff was set as 450 eV and a Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh of 4 × 4 × 1 was used. Lattice parameters were fully relaxed, the geometry of the crystal was fully optimized for the electron structure and total energy calculation. The absorption energies between gas molecules and C3N4 were calculated using the following equation:Eabs = Egas + EC3N4 − Egas@C3N4where E is the electronic energies of the studied system.
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2
The photocatalytic CO2 reduction experiments were performed in a Labsolar-6A system (Perfect Light Co., China). As shown in Fig. S6,† 0.05 g photocatalyst was uniformly dispersed on a thick glass sheet having an area of about 7 cm2, and then placed in a reaction cell (Pyrex glass) with a total volume of 350 mL. The system was vacuumed before the light was irradiated such that the air was completely discharged. Then, high-purity CO2 gas was introduced into the reactor, and 5 mL of deionized water was injected into the bottom of the reactor as a reducing agent. The sample was not directly contacted with H2O, thus photocatalytic reaction was carried out in an atmosphere of gaseous CO2 and gaseous H2O. After standing for 30 min, the reactor was then irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp (420 nm filter) from the top. Water was circulated during the experiment, and the reaction temperature was maintained at a constant temperature of 20 °C. In the course of the reaction, the gas in the reaction pool was tested every 1 h with GC2010Plus gas chromatography (GC) with a flame ion detector (GC-FID, GDX-502 column) and a thermal conductivity coefficient detector (GC-TCD, TDX-01 column).
