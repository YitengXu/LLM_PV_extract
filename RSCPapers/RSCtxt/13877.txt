    , Accepted 30th April 2019First published on 30th April 2019AbstractIn this paper, we synthesize the size distribution and optical properties of the atmospheric water-soluble fraction of light-absorbing organic carbon (brown carbon; BrC) in the continental outflow from the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) in South Asia to the North Indian Ocean. A comparison of the mass absorption coefficient of water-soluble BrC (babs-WSBrC-365nm) in PM2.5 with that in PM10 sampled over the Bay of Bengal reveals the dominance of BrC in fine mode. Furthermore, the babs-BrC-365nm shows a significant linear relationship with mass concentrations of airborne particulate matter, water-soluble organic carbon and non-sea-salt-K+ in the continental outflow from the IGP. This observation emphasizes the ubiquitous nature and significant contribution of water-soluble BrC from biomass burning emissions (BBEs). Comparing the absorption properties from this study with global datasets, it is discernible that BBEs dominate BrC absorption. Furthermore, the imaginary refractive index of water-soluble BrC (kWSBrC-365nm) in marine aerosols sampled over the North Indian Ocean during November is significantly higher than during December to January. Thus, significant temporal variability is associated with crop-residue burning emissions in the IGP on the composition of BrC over the North Indian Ocean. Our estimates show that the babs-WSBrC-365nm and kWSBrC-365nm from post-harvest crop-residue burning emissions in the IGP are much higher than the BBEs from the southeastern United States and Amazonian forest fires. Another major finding of this study is the lack of significant relationship between kWSBrC-365nm and the mass ratio of elemental carbon to particulate organic matter, as previously suggested by chamber experiments to model varying BrC absorption properties in ambient aerosols. Therefore, considerable spatio-temporal variability prevails among emission sources (wood burning vs. crop-residue burning), which needs to be considered when assessing the regional radiative forcing of BrC relative to major absorbing elemental carbon.

Environmental significance
A certain class of organic compounds in the atmosphere absorb light in the near-UV region, referred to as brown carbon (BrC), another recently recognized climate-affecting competitor of black carbon (BC), characterized by their broad spectral absorption properties. Our observations over the North Indian Ocean revealed that BrC particles from crop-residue/wood burning and fossil-fuel combustion in South Asia mostly occur in fine mode, and those influenced by forest fires exist in relatively coarse mode. Contrary to chamber studies, BrC absorption over South Asia and in the continental outflow does not exhibit a relationship with mass ratio of BC to organic matter in aerosols, hence emphasizing the need to consider the diverse and high geographical variability in assessing regional climate forcing.

1. Introduction
Airborne carbon particles, emitted by a variety of natural (e.g. wildfires, resuspension of soil organic matter, biogenic emissions) and anthropogenic processes (e.g. biomass burning, fossil fuel combustion), have received considerable attention from the scientific community due to their impact on Earth's radiation budget through direct (i.e., absorption and scattering) and indirect radiative effects (e.g., cloud albedo effect, cloud lifetime).1,2 The predicted radiative forcing estimates of light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols (LACs) carry large uncertainties, arising mainly due to a rather poor characterization of chemical and optical properties.3 The LACs are comprised of both strongly absorbing black carbon (BC) or elemental carbon (EC) and weakly absorbing organic carbon (brown carbon, BrC; mostly absorbing in the near-UV region) aerosols.4 Among these, BC is a minor component of LACs (i.e., often accounting for ∼1–10% of PM2.5 mass) and is an important warming agent of our planet after CO2 with predicted net radiative forcing estimates ranging from +0.17 to +2.1 W m−2 (av. +1.1 W m−2).5 On the other hand, the overall warming effect of light-absorbing organic aerosols (OA) for the internally and/or externally mixed scenario is +0.12 W m−2 and +0.22 W m−2, respectively.6 These estimates are also consistent with other studies focusing on BrC aerosol radiative forcing (e.g., +0.04 W m−2 to +0.11 W m−2 by Feng et al.;7 +0.22 W m−2 to +0.57 W m−2 by Lin et al.;8 +0.11 W m−2 by Wang et al.9). Though these forcing estimates are comparatively lower in magnitude, it is conceived widely now to assess the bulk absorption characteristics of BrC due to its ubiquitous nature and higher atmospheric abundance.10–12
While the climate effects of BC are well recognized,13 the role of BrC is poorly characterized due to the more complex nature of absorbing organic molecules and the paucity of observations.10,14–17 Unlike BC, BrC is either emitted directly from combustion sources such as biomass/fossil fuel;4,17–23 and/or formed through ambient photochemical reactions such as formation of light-absorbing nitrophenols,24 by the uptake of isoprene epoxydiols on acidic sulfate aerosol,25 nitro derivatives from the glyoxal chemistry,26 secondary organic aerosols (SOA) generated through a mixture O3/α-pinene/NO3. radicals27 as well as carbonyl chemistry in solution containing amines28 in the atmosphere during transport. The impact of LACs over South and East Asia is critical due to their projected climate effects.
A growing number of studies reported in the literature have highlighted the significance of biomass burning emissions (BBEs) as a major contributor to BrC aerosols globally22,29–34 and also over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), a hotspot region characterized by intense emission of LACs in South Asia, and outflow to the Indian Ocean.12,35–44 The net effect of organic aerosols on climate forcing also depends on changing optical properties of BrC.45–47 It is, therefore, essential to incorporate relevant parameterization of BrC aerosols from the IGP to improve the direct radiative forcing estimates and climate forcing feedbacks from South Asia. Recent studies have developed a strategy to incorporate absorption characteristics of BrC aerosols from BBEs in global climate models based on their relationship with either modified combustion efficiency (MCE) or BC to OA loading,6,15,48,49 assessed from chamber experiments of wood burning. However, the application of this parameterization with regionally representative ambient measurements from South Asia is lacking in the literature. Therefore, our goal here is to validate the relevance of these parameterizations for the existing literature datasets from the IGP and the IGP outflow to the North Indian Ocean. In addition, we have reviewed the knowledge gap in BrC aerosol research and suggest future needs to understand the changing optical properties during long-range transport.
2. Methodology
2.1. Synoptic meteorology: AMBTs and MODIS fire count data
Atmospheric outflow from the IGP and Southeast Asia (SEA) during the northeast monsoon (late November to early April) significantly influences the chemical composition of aerosols (here BrC) over the North Indian Ocean.37,50–52 The IGP is characterized by intense agricultural activities and heavily urbanized land in northern India, northbound by the Himalayas and accommodates ∼400 million people. The IGP is also a hub for widespread emission of LACs, largely originating from post-harvest crop-residue/wood burning, dung cake combustion, vehicular exhaust, and coal-fired power plants.40,53–59 Favorable meteorological conditions aided by shallow boundary layer during the late northeast monsoon facilitate the advection of airborne BrC and other pollutants from the IGP to the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) of the North Indian Ocean. Here, we synthesize the absorption characteristics of water-soluble BrC from source region (Patiala: PTA, in Punjab) and receptor site in the IGP (Kharagpur: KGP) as well as from the MABL of the North Indian Ocean. Fig. 1 depicts the 7 day isentropic backward air mass back trajectories (AMBTs) along with moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite-based fire count data for the aerosol sampling days for all these sites. These results clearly emphasize the impact of crop-residue/wood burning emissions in the IGP and forest fires in SEA as major sources of atmospheric water-soluble BrC.

2.2. Aerosol sampling and analysis of chemical constituents
Aerosol samples (PM2.5 and PM10) were collected on pre-combusted quartz filters using a high-volume air sampler at the two sampling sites in the IGP and also from the MABL of the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea during two research cruises (SS-259 and SK-254). Table 1 describes details of the sampling location, duration, type and the total number of aerosol samples for the BrC absorption data used in this study. The particulate mass loading was assessed by standard gravimetric analysis. A portion of the filter was placed in a precleaned Savillex Teflon vial and extracted with Milli-Q water (specific resistivity: 18.2 MΩ cm) by ultrasonic agitation (10 min × 3 times). Water extracts were centrifuged and the supernatant was injected into a Dionex-500 ion chromatograph connected in line with suppressed conductivity detection. Methanesulfonic acid (20 mM) was used as eluent for cations and a mixture of 1.7 mM NaHCO3 and 1.8 mM Na2CO3 solutions as an eluent for anions. Cations were separated using a CS-12A column connected to a cation self-regenerating suppressor (CSRS-300), and anions were separated on AS-14 with an anion self-regenerating suppressor (ASRS). The aqueous extracts of aerosol samples were filtered using pre-combusted Whatman glass fiber filter (GF/F, 0.7 μm) and measured for water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) with a total organic carbon analyzer (Shimadzu TOC-5000A). A 1.5 cm2 punch of the filter sample was used for assessing the mass concentrations of EC and organic carbon (OC) with a thermo-optical transmittance-based carbon analyzer using National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH-5040) protocol.60,61 More details of the analytical procedures are provided elsewhere.37,62

2.3. Optical properties of water-soluble BrC
We used the mass absorption coefficient and efficiency (babs-WSBrC-365nm and MAEWSBrC-365nm, respectively) and absorption Ångstrom exponent of water-soluble BrC (AÅEWSBrC) from our earlier datasets31 from the IGP and IGP outflow to the North Indian Ocean for assessing the (i) imaginary refractive index of BrC (kWSBrC), (ii) relative radiative forcing of BrC over EC and (iii) simple forcing efficiency (SFEWSBrC). Furthermore, we synthesized the available data on BrC optical properties from the IGP source/receptor sites and compared with the cruise datasets as well as the data from island observatories to understand the characteristics of BrC aerosols from South Asia. These optical properties of water-soluble BrC are briefly mentioned below.
The babs-WSBrC is assessed from the light absorption of bulk water extract of aerosols at 365 nm relative to 700 nm (i.e., reference wavelength not absorbing) as follows: (1)here, A365 and A700 are the measured absorbances at 365 and 700 nm, respectively. Vextract refers to the volume of deionized water used for extraction and Vair is the volume of air filtered (m3). Likewise, l is the path length of the cell used for light absorption measurement and fdil is the dilution factor. The fdil accounts for not only the dilution made (if any) before measuring the light absorption but also the filter area used for the extraction and the total aerosol filter.
The babs-BrC is dependent on the wavelength according to eqn (2) (ref. 63) and the power exponent of wavelength is referred to as AÅEWSBrC:64 (2)
The mass absorption efficiency at 365 nm (MAEWSBrC-365nm) is defined as (3)
The light extinction of ambient aerosols is often described by their refractive index (m = n + ik), which is a complex number with imaginary part (k) being mostly responsible for the absorption and real part (n) dictating the refraction.65 We estimated the complex component of the refractive index of a light-absorbing portion of WSOC (kWSBrC-365nm), which is similar to previous studies:39,66 (4)here, ρ is the particle density in the atmosphere (i.e., 1.5 g cm−3, adopted from Shamjad et al.67).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Atmospheric loading of OA: evidence for BrC in PM2.5
Over the IGP, BBEs are a major source of airborne particulate organic matter (i.e., estimated here as OC × 1.5 (ref. 68)), assessed based on the radiocarbon/stable carbon isotopic composition of total organic carbon,40,69 accounting for on average ∼50% of PM2.5 loadings (i.e., ∼100–400 μg m−3 over Patiala and ∼20–180 μg m−3 over Kharagpur) during winter. We have ascertained the impact of continental outflow from the IGP on the North Indian Ocean during winter by comparing the diagnostic mass ratios of crustal elements and anthropogenic species.51,68,70,71 Besides, the radiative forcing estimates of aerosols over the North Indian Ocean have included only BC and dust but not BrC.52,72 The net effect of OA on regional radiative forcing depends on the quantitative emission estimates from different sources, relative proportions of absorbing versus non-absorbing organics, composition, particle size distribution, and their variable optical characteristics.73 Because of the various types and complex nature of constituent organic compounds, global climate models use the OC loading to represent the particulate organic matter. However, aging (or oxidation) processes during transport significantly influence the absolute loading of OC and the light-absorption properties of constituent BrC compounds. It is, therefore, necessary to incorporate this variability alongside the ground-based measurements of OC concentrations to understand the net influence of BrC on aerosol radiative forcing.
In general, OC loading from a source region along with other major water-soluble inorganic ions (e.g., SO42−, NO3−, K+, NH4+), EC and dust are fairly sufficient to account for the mass closure of an aerosol sample by comparing their sum of concentrations with the gravimetric mass.68,74 However, receptor sites that are downwind of source emissions contain a significant fraction of unaccounted particulate matter with relatively low concentrations of OC. This is because of the oxidation of organic matter (OM) during transport, where carbon atoms are replaced by other heteroatoms such as O, N, etc. To account for the ageing effect, Turpin and Lim75 have suggested a conversion factor of 1.6 ± 0.2 and 2.1 ± 0.2 times the OC concentration (i.e., an average mass ratio of molecular weight per carbon weight of commonly reported compound classes) to assess the particulate OM loadings of urban (source) and nonurban (remote downwind sites) aerosols, respectively.
To validate the applicability of these conversion factors for the real-time data from South Asia, we have measured dominant contributing chemical species in PM2.5 from the IGP and its outflow to the Bay of Bengal. We deduced the OC to particulate OM conversions for the IGP (av. 1.5 ± 0.2; range: 1.3–2.7) and the IGP outflow sampled over the Bay of Bengal (2.0) based on the mass closure approach.68 Our OM/OC ratios are also somewhat comparable to those directly obtained by an aerosol mass spectrometer over Kanpur (∼1.84;76 1.99 (ref. 77)), another urban site in the IGP. The composition of PM2.5 over the IGP and the IGP outflow can be fairly described as ∼5–10% of EC, ∼30–50% of OM, ∼30–40% of anthropogenic water-soluble inorganic ions (SO42− + NH4+ + NO3− + K+) and ∼10% of mineral dust.68 The combined use of our independently assessed conversion factor of OC to OM along with the real-time data during the winter period could be a more representative parameterization in the regional/global climate models focusing on the radiative forcing of OA from South Asia.
3.2. Wavelength dependence and size distribution: sources of BrC
We have examined the wavelength dependency of the mass absorption coefficient of water-soluble BrC (babs-WSBrC) in aerosols, computed across the full wavelength range (i.e., between 300 nm and 700 nm) for the two sampling sites in the IGP (Patiala and Kharagpur) and over the North Indian Ocean (Fig. 2). A comparison of the spectrum of babs-WSBrC in daytime PM2.5 (Fig. 2a) with that in nighttime (Fig. 2b) over Patiala, a source region characterized by open crop-residue burning emissions, suggests significant photochemical processing of water-soluble BrC in the former samples. However, we could not see any differences in AÅEWSBrC. Another striking feature of the data is the significant decrease of babs-WSBrC-365nm with a concomitant increase of AÅEWSBrC in the IGP outflow, influenced by remnant crop-residue burning-derived BrC aerosols (Table 2). This could be due to photobleaching of chromophores in the visible region compared to the near-UV region.

We found somewhat higher babs-WSBrC-365nm and lower AÅEWSBrC in TSP collected over the North Indian Ocean during SS-259 cruise (November 2008; Fig. 2d) compared to the PM2.5 and PM10 collected over the Bay of Bengal during SK-254 cruise (27 December 2008 to 28 January 2009; Fig. 2e and f). Coincidently, the sampling period of TSP during SS-259 overlaps with crop-residue burning emissions in the IGP (e.g., Punjab region). Accordingly, both AMBTs and MODIS fire count data during SS-259 cruise showed long-range transport from BBEs in Punjab. Therefore, observed high babs-WSBrC-365nm and low AÅEWSBrC over the North Indian Ocean during early northeast monsoon emphasizes a stronger impact of BrC emissions from the crop-residue burning. Similar to SS-259 cruise (Fig. 2d), we observe low AÅEWSBrC for the PM10 sampled from the SEA outflow (i.e., forest fire influenced samples in SEA; Fig. 2f). These findings suggest that water-soluble BrC from BBEs probably occurs in coarse mode.
The mass concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 (i.e., particles having aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 and 10 μm, respectively) over the Bay of Bengal during the winter cruise (SK-254) varied as 2–78 μg m−3 and 6–108 μg m−3, respectively. A comparison of babs-WSBrC-365nm between these two size-fractionated aerosols (i.e., PM2.5 and PM10) provides an understanding of the overall broad size distributions of light-absorbing water-soluble organic compounds (or simply WSBrC here) over the Bay of Bengal during winter-Integrated Campaign of Aerosols, trace gases and Radiation Budget (W-ICARB).37 Over the Bay of Bengal, the marine aerosols sampled during the winter cruise had a significant contribution from the continental outflow from the IGP (IGP outflow) and SEA (i.e., SEA outflow).37 A comparison of babs-WSBrC-365nm in PM2.5 with that in PM10 sampled over the Bay of Bengal revealed a dominance of water-soluble BrC in fine mode (Fig. 3). It is noteworthy that the slopes of linear regression of babs-WSBrC-365nm in PM2.5versus PM10 in both the continental outflows are not statistically significant (SLOPESTEST; std. err: 0.14; t-score: 1.48; df = 27; P > 0.05). However, it is apparent from Fig. 3 that water-soluble BrC emissions from forest fires in the SEA outflow are coarser than that observed in the IGP outflow sampled over the Bay of Bengal. Another noteworthy feature of the data examined here is that babs-WSBrC-365nm shows a significant linear relationship with the PM2.5 mass loading over the IGP and the IGP outflow sampled over the Bay of Bengal (Fig. 4a and S1†). Although a quantitative assessment of mass concentration of water-soluble BrC is not feasible due to a lack of universally accepted standards and poor characterization of constituent absorbing organic compounds, this observation emphasizes the ubiquitous and significant contribution of BrC aerosols over South Asia to the ambient PM2.5.
 Fig. 3  Comparison of mass absorption coefficient of water-soluble BrC, measured at 365 nm (babs-WSBrC-365nm), in PM2.5 and PM10 aerosols sampled over the Bay of Bengal during a winter cruise (W-ICARB: 27 December 2008 to 26 January 2009). Absorption data are from ref. 37. 
 Fig. 4  Scatter plots between mass absorption coefficient of water-soluble BrC (babs-WSBrC-365nm, in units of M m−1; M = 10−6) and the mass concentrations of (a) PM2.5, (b) water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and (c) water-soluble potassium (K+) in aerosols sampled over the IGP and IGP-outflow to the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and Arabian Sea (ARS) during winter period. The K+ concentration in marine aerosols is corrected for sea salt contribution.12,36,37 
A close examination of the temporal variability of babs-WSBrC-365nm and other chemical proxies of combustion sources such as EC and nss-K+ (i.e., a proxy for vegetation burning78) in PM2.5 along with AMBTs and MODIS fire count data (Fig. 1) further strengthen our earlier inference that BrC over the Bay of Bengal is predominantly associated with BBEs in both the continental outflows (i.e., IGP and SEA outflows).12,36,37 We also observed a significant linear relationship of babs-WSBrC-365nm with mass concentrations of WSOC and K+ (i.e., corrected for sea salts in the case of marine aerosols) in the IGP outflow to the North Indian Ocean (Fig. 4b and c). This observation clearly indicates their common source contribution from BBEs and/or common transport pathway. The radiocarbon (i.e., 14C)-based source apportionment studies of WSOC from an urban site (Delhi) of the IGP and the MCOH (i.e., a receptor observatory in the North Indian Ocean and influenced by the IGP outflow) during winter season have revealed the dominant contribution (∼80%) from BBEs.41,42 Likewise, the dominant contribution of OC from BBEs over the IGP during winter period is also discernible from the 14C-based isotopic signatures of total (organic) carbon (TOC ≈ EC + OC).40,69 Taking together all of these observations, we have inferred that BBEs (i.e., wood burning/crop-residue burning) in the IGP mostly contribute to BrC aerosols in the continental outflow to the North Indian Ocean.
On the contrary, several studies have highlighted the significant contribution of WSOC and hence BrC aerosols (i.e., due to the linear relationship with babs-WSBrC-365nm) from fossil-fuel combustion sources over East Asia.21 Likewise, Zhang et al.79 have observed that BrC-SOA over Pasadena (i.e., a receptor site of air pollutants from Los Angeles, California) is 4–6 times more absorbing (MAEWSBrC-365nm: 0.69–0.77 m2 g−1) compared to the fresh-SOA over Atlanta, Georgia (∼0.11–0.19 m2 g−1). Although both these sampling sites are urban regions, the compositional variability in the precursor volatile organic compounds (i.e., photooxidation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons under high NOx over Los Angeles) and their oxidation pathways to SOA has been suggested as a principal cause for the observed differences in the BrC absorption.79 In order to assess the regional source strength of BrC emissions, we have compared the babs-WSBrC-365nm, MAEWSBrC-365nm, and AÅEBrC from South Asia with those documented in the literature.
On a global scale, it is evident from this compilation that BBEs dominate the BrC absorption with relatively high values of babs-WSBrC-365nm being noteworthy for the post-harvest crop-residue burning emissions from the IGP in South Asia (Fig. 5a). Interestingly, the source strength of BBEs on the BrC (i.e., either primarily emitted or secondarily formed) absorption in the urban environments of the IGP36,39,80,81 in South Asia, per se represented by babs-WSBrC-365 nm, is ∼1–2 orders of magnitude higher than that observed in the USA79 and somewhat comparable to that documented from East Asia82,83 (Fig. 5a). However, the MAEWSBrC-365 nm shows somewhat higher values from several geographical locations over South and East Asia as well as North America (Fig. 5b). This observation suggests greater contribution of BrC aerosols from BBEs to the columnar load of airborne LACs over South Asia. Furthermore, the MAEWSBrC-365nm from the crop-residue burning emissions in the northwestern IGP (e.g., Punjab region) is somewhat similar to that from wood burning emissions (0.13–1.1 m2 g−1)19 but comparatively higher than those documented for secondary BrC aerosols (0.001–0.088 m2 g−1).84 Overall, our results highlight the broad absorption characteristics of polar BrC (i.e., based on water extract). However, rather limited studies have focused on the absorption properties of water-insoluble BrC from South Asia and other studies elsewhere. Satish and Rastogi have documented a somewhat larger share of absorption from the water-insoluble BrC in paddy residue burning emissions over the IGP. Likewise, Shamjad et al. have estimated higher values of the imaginary refractive index of water-insoluble BrC from another urban site in the central IGP. Sengupta et al.85 have demonstrated that non-polar fraction of BrC (i.e., based on n-hexane extract) is 2.3 times more absorbing in nature than polar BrC (i.e., based on water extract) for four most commonly used global biomass types.

3.3. Imaginary refractive index of water-soluble BrC
The imaginary refractive index of BrC (k) is mostly responsible for the absorption.65 Here, we have assessed the imaginary refractive index of water-soluble BrC (kWSBrC-365nm) during winter season over the IGP (Patiala: 0.02–0.14; av. 0.061 ± 0.034; Kanpur: ∼0.042;39 Kharagpur: 0.037 ± 0.012 (ref. 36)) which is somewhat higher than that of the IGP outflow sampled over the Bay of Bengal (December 2008 to January 2009: 0.011–0.036; November 2008: 0.021–0.032) and the Arabian Sea (November 2008: 0.014–0.073). A gradual decrease in kWSBrC-365nm values from the IGP source region (Patiala) to downwind receptor sites (Kanpur, Kharagpur)/oceanic regions (Bay of Bengal) may be due to a decrease in source strength of BBEs during transport. Given the widespread impact of IGP outflow on the North Indian Ocean during northeast monsoon, the kWSBrC-365nm values during November 2008 cruise (0.028 ± 0.011) were higher (t-score = 2.83; df = 53; P < 0.05) by a factor of 1.3 than those observed during December 2008 to January 2009 (0.022 ± 0.007). However, no such significant differences were observed in the kWSBrC-365nm values of aerosols from Arabian Sea (0.029 ± 0.014) and Bay of Bengal (0.027 ± 0.004) during a November 2008 cruise (for the cruise tracks, see ref. 37). Our estimates of kWSBrC-365nm for samples influenced by biomass burning sources in the IGP (at Patiala12) are much higher than those observed from the southeastern United States and Amazonian fires (Fig. 5c). Due to the inherent relationship between MAEBrC-365nm and kWSBrC-365nm, their spatial variability trends are somewhat similar (Fig. 5c).
To effectively model the variability in optical properties of BrC from BBEs, some studies have made use of the relationship between MCE (a ratio of molar concentration of CO2 to that of CO2 and CO) and kBrC, MAEBrC or AÅEBrC.86,87 It has been shown by these laboratory-based combustion studies of different wildfuels that BrC absorption characteristics are better correlated with the EC/OC or EC/OM ratios compared to MCE.6,15,49 Furthermore, these studies have also suggested that BrC absorption from BBEs is a characteristic feature of organic compounds with extremely low volatility and depends mostly on the combustion conditions, as represented by the BC/OA ratio, instead of on fuel types.6,15 Additionally, Saleh et al.15 have proposed a linear dependency of kBrC-505nm on BC/OA ratio for a wide range of household biofuels (e.g., black spruce, ponderosa pine, rice-straw, organic hay, sawgrass, and wiregrass) in climate models to account for regionally varying BrC aerosol radiative forcing. Therefore, we have reexamined the interrelationships of BrC optical properties and their variability or association with EC/OM ratios in the IGP outflow.
We could not observe any such linear relationship between kWSBrC-365nm or kWSBrC-550 nm and EC/OM (here OM = OC × 1.5 and OC × 2.0 for continental and marine aerosols, respectively) over the IGP and the IGP outflow to the North Indian Ocean (Fig. 6). The data in Fig. 6 include aerosol samples from both the crop-residue burning emissions (from Patiala-Punjab: rice-straw) and wood burning emissions (Kharagpur, KGP: December 2009–March 2010) in the IGP, and the IGP outflow sampled over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Our results are consistent with the previous findings from Kanpur, another urban site in the central IGP.67 The lack of linear relationship between log(EC/OM) and kWSBrC-365nm in the South Asian outflow, therefore, clearly emphasizes the need to reconcile the current parametrization of BrC optical properties from real ambient aerosols compared to those observed in the controlled combustion/chamber experiments.
 Fig. 6  Scatter plot between the mass ratio of EC to OM and the imaginary refractive index of water-soluble fraction of BrC (kBrC-365nm) absorption measured in water extracts at 365 nm in ambient aerosols influenced by BBEs over the IGP and its outflow over the North Indian Ocean.12,36,37,100 Here OM is 1.5 and 2.0 times OC for continental and marine aerosols, respectively.68 This compilation includes data from four sampling sites in the IGP (Patiala, Punjab;12 Delhi;100 Kharagpur: KGP;36 Bhola, Bangladesh),100 Maldives Climate Observatory at Hanimaadhoo (MCOH)100 and two research expeditions from the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and the North Indian Ocean (SS-259 and SK-254).37 BBEs refer to biomass burning emissions. 
We have observed an inverse linear relationship between kWSBrC-365nm and AÅEBrC for the IGP outflow (Fig. 7). As MAEWSBrC is related to AÅEWSBrC (i.e., MAEWSBrC ≈ Kλ−AÅEWSBrC; K = proportionality constant),17 the observed negative relationship is, therefore, obvious between kWSBrC-365nm and AÅEWSBrC. Similar to this study, Chen and Bond19 have observed a negative linear relationship between AÅEWSBrC and MAEWSBrC (i.e., assessed based on methanol extracts of biofuel burning-generated aerosols). Furthermore, their study has shown a decrease in AÅEBrC with an increase in the temperature of biofuel (wood) burning (higher BrC absorption with increasing temperature; contrary to Saleh et al.15). However, Fig. 7 also depicts the variability of EC/OM ratios for a given pair of AÅEWSBrC and kWSBrC-365nm values in the IGP outflow. On a similar note, no significant linear relationships were observed between AÅEWSBrC or MAEBrC-365 or kWSBrC-365nm and the EC/OM ratios in the IGP outflow (data not shown here). These results are somewhat contrary to those deduced by Saleh et al.15 based on chamber experiments of different biofuel combustion-generated aerosols in which BrC absorption was correlated with BC/OA ratio. Likewise, Xie et al.88 also found a similar linear relationship between the optical properties of BrC and EC/OC ratios for the individual wood combustion-generated aerosols but was not observed for pooled biofuel combustion samples. Based on these chamber experiments, Xie et al.88 have suggested that both fuel types and combustion conditions are crucial factors that dictate the light-absorption characteristics of evolving BrC. However, our observations from the IGP outflow are in contrast with inferences from chamber experiments. Overall, BrC absorption characteristics over South Asia are not only influenced by fuel type and combustion conditions but also affected by other atmospheric processes such as OM oxidation during long-range transport (i.e., photobleaching).12,41,42

Here OM is 1.5 and 2.0 times OC for continental and marine aerosols, respectively. This compilation includes data from four sampling sites in the IGP (Patiala: PTA;12 Delhi;100 Kharagpur: KGP;36 Bhola, Bangladesh),100 Maldives Climate Observatory at Hanimaadhoo (MCOH)100 and two research expeditions from the North Indian Ocean (SS-259 and SK-254).37 
3.4. Relative radiative forcing (RRFBrC)
We have estimated the fraction of solar radiation absorbed by water-soluble BrC compared to that absorbed by EC (termed relative radiative forcing; RRFBrC) in the IGP outflow sampled over the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea37 according to methods described in earlier publications.12,36,42,81,89 To estimate RRFBrC, we first need to assess the wavelength-dependent fraction of solar emission flux absorbed by BrC (i.e., here the light-absorbing WSOC) and EC, which can be approximated by using their wavelength-dependent MAEλ (i.e., MAEλ0 × (λ/λ0)−AÅEBrC) and the Lambert–Beer law as given in eqn (5) and (6): (5) (6)
In eqn (5) and (6), MAE refers to mass absorption efficiency (in units of m2 g−1). Wavelength λ0 corresponds to 365 nm for the light-absorbing WSOC and 678 nm for EC. Likewise [WSOC] and [EC] refer to their mass concentrations and λ is any wavelength between 300 nm and 2500 nm. Here, we assumed the atmospheric boundary layer height (hABL) as 1000 m as the samples analyzed belong to the winter season. We used the solar emission flux (I0(λ)) from the clear sky Air Mass 1 Global Horizontal (AM1GH) solar irradiance model by Levinson et al.90 and the output from eqn (5) and (6) in (7) to estimate the fraction of solar radiation absorbed by the light-absorbing WSOC relative to that of EC in marine aerosols from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea during winter period: (7)
Our estimates of RRFBrC in the IGP outflow to the Bay of Bengal during December 2008 to January 2009 (2 ± 1%; no. of samples, N = 15) were significantly lower (two-tailed t-test; t-score = 10.3, df = 21; p < 0.05) than that sampled during November 2008 (12 ± 4%; N = 8). Likewise, significant differences (t-score = 2.7; df = 21; p < 0.05) were observed between Arabian Sea (8 ± 4%; N = 15) and Bay of Bengal for the IGP outflow sampled during November 2008. This observation highlights the persistent differences in the relative proportions of BrC and EC, primarily due to the varying source emissions of BBEs (crop-residue vs. wood combustion), over the IGP and the North Indian Ocean during the impact of IGP outflow. The AMBTs for the sampling days show their origin from the IGP during both cruises (November 2008 and December 2008 to January 2009). However, several studies have documented that post-harvest crop-residue burning emissions (in October to November) in the IGP significantly influence the composition of OA and, therefore, could be a major source of BrC (i.e., as evident from the back trajectories and relative increase in MODIS fire counts over the IGP) during November 2008 cruise. On the other hand, wood burning emissions mostly contribute to OA (here BrC) over the IGP during the winter period. Therefore, we infer that observed relative differences in the fraction of solar radiation absorbed by BrC compared to EC over the North Indian Ocean could be primarily due to variability in the source emissions of BrC.
Our RRFBrC values from the North Indian Ocean are comparable to (but somewhat lower than) those obtained from the source/receptor sites influenced by the BBEs in the IGP. For instance, we found that average RRFBrC was ∼40% over Patiala (i.e., a source site), ∼3–11% over New Delhi42 and ∼2–34% over Kharagpur36 (i.e., receptor sites) and ∼1% over MCOH (an island observatory in the Indian Ocean)41 and are influenced by BBEs in the IGP. Using a different approach, Shamjad et al.39 have estimated that BrC absorption could account for ∼30% of that of EC at an urban site (Kanpur) in the central IGP and is also influenced by the BBEs. Likewise, Kirillova et al.91 reported that the WSBrC could absorb ∼4 ± 1% of solar radiation compared to that of EC at the Nepal Climate Observatory, Pyramid station (NCO-P) in the Himalayas. All these studies highlight the significance of BrC contribution (although lower) from South Asia.
Most of the BrC absorption estimates from South Asia are based on solvent extracts (i.e., water/methanol) of ambient aerosols. The absorption properties of solvent extracts of BrC can be compared with their particle nature by using the bulk solution mass absorption coefficient (i.e., α(λ)) normalized with material density (ρ). More recently, a correction factor has been proposed to account for the effect of BrC absorption in the aerosol phase before comparing it with that of BC.17,20,73,92 Absorption of organic compounds in the UV and visible regions is, in general, attributed to their electronic transitions.20 Sun et al.20 have advocated that n → π* electronic transitions are responsible for the absorption of BrC at near-UV-visible wavelengths and the energy band-gap model with Urbach tail relationship could be useful for a better description of absorption spectra of BrC rather than AÅEBrC. Moosmüller et al.92 have reviewed various theoretical models such as the damped simple harmonic oscillator model and the band-gap model with and without Urbach tail to explain the wavelength-dependent AÅEBrC and bulk absorption coefficient of particulate BrC. Andersson63 has suggested that the absorption of BrC in ambient aerosols is somewhat related to the difference between optical energy gap of bulk amorphous material (EOG) and energy of the incident light photons in a power-law relation, the power exponent being AÅEBrC. All these models provide better understanding of the wavelength-dependent absorption spectra of water-soluble BrC aerosols.
Considering the small particle sizes relative to the wavelength of light (i.e., Rayleigh regime, πd/λ ≪ 1; d = particle diameter),93 Sun et al.20 have proposed a conversion factor (ξ ≈ 0.7), which is a weak function of the imaginary part (k) of the complex refractive index of BrC, to constrain the particulate BrC absorption from the bulk solution-based BrC absorption of aerosols: (8) (9)
Using a value of ∼1.5 for the real part (i.e., n dominates the refraction) for BrC and kWSBrC-365nm from water extracts, we found that there is little (or no) variability in the ξ value (0.75 ± 0.00) for the wintertime aerosols over the Bay of Bengal. Liu et al.73 have documented that light absorption measured in the water extracts is somewhat lower than that in aerosol phase by a factor of 2, predicted using Mie theory and size-segregated BrC absorption data from the USA.30,73,94 However, we would like to emphasize here that the correction factors used to upscale/downscale the measured BrC absorption from the solvent extract would have an effect in a reciprocal manner and may not alter the interpretations in this study.
The estimates of RRFBrC over the IGP are somewhat higher than those derived by the radiative transfer/3D-global chemical transport models. For instance, Shamjad et al.38 have estimated using the optical properties of LACs (i.e., BC + BrC) from a photoacoustic soot spectrometer and the Santa Barbara Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (SB-DART) model that BrC radiative forcing contributes to ∼10–15% of LACs over the IGP (i.e., derived from increase in BrC absorption to total aerosol absorption from 2.6 W m−2 in normal days to 3.6 W m−2) during the impact of BBEs. In general, the estimated BrC contributions to total aerosol radiative forcing from the IGP and the IGP outflow sampled over the North Indian Ocean are comparable to other studies from East Asia and elsewhere. For instance, Park et al.95 have used 3-D GEOS-chem in combination with both aircraft- and ground-based measurements to assess the BrC radiative forcing (+0.05 W m−2), which accounts for ∼15% of that of LACs at the top of the atmosphere over East Asia. Likewise, the radiative transfer calculations by Zhang et al.16 indicate that BrC absorption accounts for ∼24% of that of LACs (i.e., BC + BrC) at the tropopause in which light-absorbing organic compounds within 5 km have a lower share of estimated forcing despite their higher abundance compared to that obtained from above 5 km (i.e., ∼67%). All these studies underscore the need of consideration of observation-based regionally varying BrC optical properties to assess the radiative forcing and, hence, contribute to the more accurate prediction of climate forcing feedbacks of LACs over South Asia.
3.5. Simple forcing efficiency (SFE) of BrC
We have also estimated the SFE of BrC absorption to constrain its direct radiative effect by using the approach of Bond and Bergstrom,1 which is in turn based on the formulations of Chylek and Wong.96 According to those calculations, the total radiative forcing of a particle is somewhat related to wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering properties and can be described by the following mathematical expression: (10)
In eqn (10), as and Tatm refer to surface albedo (0.19) and atmospheric transmission (0.79), respectively. Likewise, Fc corresponds to the fraction of cloud cover (0.6), SFE is expressed in W g−1 and dS(λ)/dλ is the wavelength-dependent variation in the solar irradiance. The other terms β(λ), MSC(λ) and MAE(λ) are the wavelength-dependent backscattered fraction of light, mass scattering cross-section and mass absorption efficiency (i.e., in m2 g−1). For this calculation, we used the clear sky wavelength-dependent solar irradiance reference spectra of AM1-GH of Levinson et al. (2010). For simplicity, we have considered the absorption part of the equation to estimate SFE of BrC in the IGP outflow and the above equation is modified according to Lei et al. (2017).97 However, it is important to note that in eqn (11) the scattering part always dominates the SFEBrC and, therefore, this parameter always carries a negative sign, which implies cooling effect on climate: (11)
By integrating eqn (11) for the wavelength range from 300 to 700 nm, we obtained the SFEBrC values for the IGP outflow. The SFEBrC values ranged from 0.4 to 10.2 W g−1 (2.5 ± 1.9 W g−1) over Patiala (PTA), 0.3 to 1.9 W g−1 (1.0 ± 0.3 W g−1) over Kharagpur (KGP), and 0.3 to 1.9 (0.7 ± 0.4 W g−1) over the Bay of Bengal during SK-254 cruise, and 0.4 to 1.3 W g−1 (0.8 ± 0.2) over the North Indian Ocean during SS-259 cruise. Our SFEBrC values from the IGP are comparable to those from the laboratory biofuel combustion-generated BrC aerosols from China.97 Bond and Bergstrom1 have shown that a small change in the imaginary part of the complex refractive index (i.e., from 1.55 + 0.05i to 1.55 + 0.06i) could turn the SFEBrC from negative to positive (i.e., warming). Therefore, changes in kWSBrC during long-range transport from the IGP to North Indian Ocean significantly influence SFEWSBrC.
By looking at the spectral variability of SFEBrC values with a wavelength range between 300 and 700 nm (Fig. 8), we observed a significant increase in AÅEBrC from the source region that is influenced by BBEs in the IGP to IGP outflow sampled over the Bay of Bengal during the winter cruise. By comparing the radiocarbon isotopic composition of WSOC in PM2.5 from an urban region in the northwest IGP (i.e., Delhi) and the downwind oceanic receptor site in the Indian Ocean (i.e., MCOH) as well as hilltop observatory in the Himalayas, Gustafsson and coworkers have demonstrated that BBEs dominate the light-absorbing OA.41,42,91 Although we have not measured the radiocarbon signatures of WSOC, given the significant linear relationship of babs-WSBrC with water-soluble fine potassium (K+), we infer that BBEs in the IGP outflow are a major source of BrC over South Asia.36,37 However, recent literature highlights the significance of BrC from vehicular emissions and coal combustion.21 These contrasting views need further detailed investigation on the relative significance of BrC emissions from different combustion sources and both physical and chemical processes affecting their light-absorption characteristics are, thus, crucial for assessing the climate effects of LACs over South Asia. All these studies have emphasized the widespread occurrence of BrC aerosols in the IGP outflow to the tropical Indian Ocean. Incorporation of these observation-based optical properties of BrC in global climate models could reduce the uncertainties related to the radiative forcing estimates of light-absorbing OA over South Asia.

3.6. Research needs for BrC from South Asia
A rapidly increasing number of studies in the literature have emphasized that the solution pH of solvent extracts of aerosols significantly influences the light absorption by BrC. For instance, some studies have observed a significant shift in the absorption properties of BrC in water extracts with solution pH varying from 2 to 8.98 A majority of the studies have not measured/reported the solution pH of the water extracts used for the assessment of BrC absorption. However, varying pH of the solvents could significantly affect the absorption by shifting the wavelength-dependent absorbance curve and, thereby, could cause variations in AÅEBrC.99 In contrast, Dasari et al.100 have shown that the changing solution pH of water extracts between source region in the IGP (i.e., at Delhi) and the downwind continental and island receptor sites (Bhola, Bangladesh and Maldives Climate Observatory at Hanimaadhoo) has rather limited (or no) effect on light-absorbing WSOC in the South Asian outflow to the Indian Ocean. It is also important to consider that absorption properties of BrC aerosols assessed from water and organic solvent extracts are somewhat different from those predicted for ambient particles based on the Mie theory.20,73,92 Furthermore, there exists an inherent assumption that the dissolution process has no effect on the source-specific absorption characteristics of BrC chromophores and/or no in situ formation of new light-absorbing organic compounds in the solvent extracts due to the coexistence of other inorganic ions such as NH4+, SO42− and other non-absorbing OA. All these factors significantly affect BrC absorption and, thereby, affect the derived optical properties from bulk solutions.
Recently, Satish and Rastogi44 have observed larger contribution of water-insoluble BrC (i.e., based on the differences in the absorption spectra of methanol and water-soluble BrC) in aerosols derived from paddy residue burning. Satish and Rastogi44 have also found a considerable shift in the absorption spectra of water- and methanol-soluble BrC from paddy residue burning in Punjab, northwest India. According to their results, water-soluble BrC showed absorption mostly in the near-UV region (300–400 nm) and that of methanol-soluble BrC extended also to the visible region. However, Phillips and Smith101 have reported that methanol-soluble BrC absorption is grossly overestimated by a factor of almost two compared to that obtained from water extracts if not accounting for light extinction by the scattering species in the solvent. While the BrC absorption characteristics studied over the Indian Ocean are mostly during the continental outflow, abundant presence of color dissolved organic matter in the surface waters could also be likely to contribute to atmospheric BrC. However, the possibility of BrC contribution from remote marine aerosols has never been investigated or considered to assess the relative source strength of oceanic versus continental sources. Considering this divergence in analytical methods, there is an urgent need for making a generally acceptable extraction protocol (i.e., choice of solvent, pH and wavelength at which babs-BrC needs to measured) before assessing the optical properties of BrC from solvent extracts and incorporating them in global climate models to assess the radiative forcing of LACs.
Due to the highly variable optical characteristics and complex nature of constituent light-absorbing organic compounds from source emissions/formation pathways, we need more observations from regional to global scale for refining climate models and satellite retrieval algorithms in order to accurately predict the climate effects of BrC.15,17,43,102 Over the IGP, foggy conditions are more prevalent during the winter period. Therefore, it is likely that the optical properties of light-absorbing OA could be influenced by fog processing. More recently, Choudhary et al.103 have documented that both MAEBrC-365nm (1.8 ± 0.2 m2 g−1) and RRFBrC (54.3 ± 16.5%) are significantly enhanced by fog processing and are distinctly different from those observed during non-foggy days (i.e., 1.6 ± 0.1 m2 g−1 and 23.7 ± 10.8%, respectively) over the IGP. However, Choudhary et al.103 have observed no substantial changes in AÅEBrC between foggy (2.0–3.6) and non-foggy days (1.7–3.9). Likewise, the effect of fog processing on the chemical composition of OA was also evident through the relative increase in OC/EC and WSOC/OC ratios over the central IGP during the winter period.104 Therefore, fog chemistry could be an important factor for the varying BrC optical properties in the IGP outflow.
Chakrabarty et al.35 have suggested that the traditional burning of funeral pyres is also a significant source of BrC over South Asia. Additionally, their study reported that the mean MAEBrC was 3.11 m2 g−1 at 550 nm and BrC absorption peaked between 400 nm and 600 nm. However, most (or all) of the PM2.5 sampled from the source and receptor sites in the IGP and the IGP outflow over the Bay of Bengal showed peak maximum at less than 400 nm, perhaps relating to different BrC compounds from those documented from South Asian funeral pyre combustion. Likewise, it has been highlighted that aqueous chemistry involving the reactions of carbonyl compounds (e.g., methylglyoxal, glyoxal) with ammonia or acidic ammonium sulfate could contribute SOA that are significantly light-absorbing in the near-UV-visible region.105 If this reaction pathway governs BrC absorption, we would expect a secondary absorption maximum between 400 nm and 500 nm.105 However, the typically observed absorption spectrum of BrC in the water extracts analyzed from the IGP and its outflow to the Bay of Bengal showed peak maximum below 400 nm. These findings indicate either a minor contribution of light-absorbing OA from funeral pyres in South Asia to BrC absorption or the SOA formed here in the IGP outflow to the Bay of Bengal are susceptible to much-aging processes.
4. Conclusions
Overall, the light-absorption properties of BrC aerosols from anthropogenic combustion sources (i.e., either BBEs or fossil fuel combustion) are inherently linked with the composition of OA. More recently, Lin et al.106 have documented that nitroaromatic compounds could account for 70–80% of the BrC absorption in the atmospheric aerosols sampled during a nationwide biomass burning event. The molecular-level analysis of OA from BBEs (e.g., sawgrass, peak, ponderosa pine, and black spruce) has revealed the abundant presence of BrC chromophores from functional groups containing nitroaromatics,106–108 polyphenols108 and derivatives of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.108 These kinds of studies would be further relevant to understand the complex nature and type of BrC aerosols from South Asia; however, these are lacking in the literature. Despite a growing number of observations assessing BrC absorption, there exists still a paucity of data on the molecular-level characterization of compound classes responsible for the light-absorbing nature, origin (primary emissions vs. secondary formation) and regional relative significance over South Asia.

Environmental significance
A certain class of organic compounds in the atmosphere absorb light in the near-UV region, referred to as brown carbon (BrC), another recently recognized climate-affecting competitor of black carbon (BC), characterized by their broad spectral absorption properties. Our observations over the North Indian Ocean revealed that BrC particles from crop-residue/wood burning and fossil-fuel combustion in South Asia mostly occur in fine mode, and those influenced by forest fires exist in relatively coarse mode. Contrary to chamber studies, BrC absorption over South Asia and in the continental outflow does not exhibit a relationship with mass ratio of BC to organic matter in aerosols, hence emphasizing the need to consider the diverse and high geographical variability in assessing regional climate forcing.
