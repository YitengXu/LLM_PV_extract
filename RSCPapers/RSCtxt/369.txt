    , Accepted 5th February 2021First published on 6th February 2021AbstractThe construction of organic solar cells with stacked structures by the sequential deposition (SD) of donor and acceptor films has great potential in industrial production, as it demonstrates little dependence on the ratio of donor and acceptor materials, solvents, and additives. Herein, we present an eco-friendly solvent protection (ESP) method for the fabrication of high-performance OSCs with stacked structures. Several non-aromatic and non-halogenated solvents are employed as protective agents to build SD devices with a configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS Clevios P VP Al 4083)/donor/protective solvent/acceptor/perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Al, which shows that n-octane is the optimal choice for SD devices. Nine different SD systems including the fullerene and nonfullerene ones present comparable photovoltaic performance to their BC counterparts, which proves the universality of this ESP method. Significantly, the device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/D18/N3/PDINO/Al with n-octane as the protective solvent achieves a maximum PCE of 17.52%, which is the record efficiency of SD devices. Furthermore, a protective factor (δ) is proposed to demonstrate the quantitative relationship between δ and PCE after experimental and theoretical investigation, which presents an idea to understand the mechanism and provides a guideline for solvent choices.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are at the dawn of commercialization. The construction of OSCs with stacked structures by sequential deposition (SD) of donor and acceptor films has great potential in industrial production. Thus, various methods including vacuum deposition, film-transfer, and a multiple spin-coating process with orthogonal solvents have been employed to fabricate stacked OSCs, which usually have various limitations for general applications. Herein, a universal method was developed for the fabrication of high performance stacked OSCs, which employed eco-friendly solvents as a protective layer (ESP) between the donor and acceptor layers. By tuning the spreading coefficient (S) and saturated vapor pressure (P) of the protective solvents, a record PCE of 17.52% for SD devices was achieved when n-octane was used as the protective solvent. Furthermore, a novel protective factor (δ) is proposed based on S and P, which presented a quantitative relationship with PCE with a (R-squared) correlation coefficient over 0.9. This factor is important to understand the mechanism and provides a guideline for the application of this ESP method.

Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn great attention in the past few decades due to their merits of low cost, light weight, and flexibility.1–4 With great efforts on material development and device engineering, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs has exceeded 17% for single-junction5–9 and double-junction tandem OSCs.10,11 The BHJ structure is generally fabricated by blend casting (BC) the solutions of donor and acceptor materials, the performance of which heavily depends on the morphology of the blend film. However, the random distribution of donor and acceptor materials in BC devices leads to an extraordinarily complicated process of morphology formation, resulting in increased carrier recombination, unbalanced charge transport, restricted efficiency, and poor stability.12–16 In order to improve device performance, various methods for device engineering including additives,17–20 solvent vapor annealing21–23 and thermal treatment24–26 were employed to tune the morphology of the active layer. To some extent, the complex fabrication processes inevitably limit the potential of commercialization of OSCs.
Recently, the sequential deposition (SD) of donor and acceptor films into a device with stacked structures has made a significant contribution to the fine regulation of morphology, balanced transportation of charges, and direct pathways for carriers.27,28 In comparison to the BC method, the independent processing and optimization of donor and acceptor materials in the SD process is a promising method in industrial production, since it exhibits little dependence on the ratio of donor and acceptor materials, solvents, and additives, etc. To date, various methods including vacuum deposition,29,30 film-transfer (floating or using poly(dimethylsiloxane) stamp),14,31–33 and a multiple spin-coating process with orthogonal solvent27,34 have been adopted for the fabrication of OSCs with stacked structures.35 Among them, solution processing of sequential organic films is a simple and straightforward method.36 Cao et al. adopted non-halogenated solvents as orthogonal solvents to fabricate bilayer OSCs with a PCE of 12.9%.37 Hou and coworkers utilized orthogonal solvents to process efficient polymer solar cells using a layer-by-layer (LbL) approach, which offered a PCE of 13.0%.38 Obviously, the requirement of orthogonal solvents for the deposition of the bilayer limits the universality of this strategy. Recently, Yan et al. took advantage of donor polymers with strong temperature-dependent aggregation (TDA) properties to sequentially process the overlying acceptors from a wide range of nonorthogonal solvents.39 Nevertheless, the obligation of donors with TDA characteristics hinders the further development of various donor polymers (e.g. PM7 without TDA characteristics). Furthermore, Sun and coworkers developed a batch-insensitive conjugated polymer with a well-defined fibril structure, followed by the deposition of non-fullerene acceptors to afford a PCE of 16.5%.40 However, this strategy is limited to the conjugated polymers that can form fibril morphology. Important progress was reported by Li and coworkers, who utilized a LbL-bladed coating strategy to fabricate efficient OSCs based on PM6:Y6, yielding a high PCE of 16.35%, which was proved to fit several donor/acceptor systems.41 Thus, developing a universal method for the fabrication of high-efficiency OSCs with stacked structures is highly in demand.
Herein, we report a novel protocol named eco-friendly solvent protection (ESP) method for the fabrication of high-performance OSCs with stacked structures. The non-aromatic and non-halogenated solvents, including dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, ethanol, methanol, and diethyl ether, are employed as protective agents to fabricate SD devices with the configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS Clevios P VP Al 4083)/donor/protective solvent/acceptor/perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Al. The eco-friendly solvent is spin coated on top of the donor film to protect the donor material from being dissolved by the recoated acceptor solvent, which shows that n-octane is the optimal choice for SD devices. With n-octane as the protective solvent, nine different donor and acceptor systems including the fullerene and nonfullerene ones are investigated and their comparable photovoltaic performance to their BC counterparts is presented, which proves the universality of this ESP method. Significantly, the device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/D18/N3/PDINO/Al with n-octane as the protective solvent achieves a maximum PCE of 17.52%, which is the highest efficiency of SD devices. Furthermore, a protective factor (δ) is proposed to demonstrate the quantitative relationship between δ and PCE after experimental and theoretical investigation.
Results and discussion
Photovoltaic performance
The SD device and chemical structures of the active layer materials are shown in Fig. 1. The donors (e.g. D18) and acceptors (e.g. N3) are insoluble or weakly soluble in eco-friendly solvents including alcohol, alkane, ether, etc. (Fig. S1, ESI†). Thus, eco-friendly solvents are used as protective agents to fabricate SD devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor/protective solvent/acceptor/PDINO/Al in this study.

The photovoltaic performance of the devices with D18:N3 film, D18/protective solvent/N3 film or D18/N3 film as the active layer is shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S2 (ESI†), Table 1 and Table S2 (ESI†). The BC photovoltaic device based on the D18:N3 film shows a high PCE of 16.58% with a VOC of 0.832 V, a JSC of 26.71 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 74.62%. The D18/N3 based device is fabricated by direct spin-coating of N3 chloroform (CHCl3) solution on top of the D18 film, which affords a much lower PCE of 15.32% with a VOC of 0.834 V, a JSC of 25.53 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 71.98%. This PCE loss may be ascribed to the damage of the D18 film upon the direct deposition of N3 CHCl3 solution (Fig. S3, ESI†). In order to protect the D18 film, several eco-friendly solvents, including DMSO, DMF, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, ethanol, methanol, and ethyl ether, are spin-coated on top of the donor film before spin-coating of N3 solution. Not surprisingly, the performance of the D18/protective solvent/N3 based devices is generally improved compared to that of the D18/N3 film based ones (Table S2, ESI†), which may be ascribed to the protection effect of the eco-friendly solvent. Furthermore, optimal PCE can be obtained by the simple adjustment of spin-coating speed, which is not limited by the ratio of donor and acceptor materials (Table S3, ESI†). Impressively, the D18/n-octane/N3 based OSCs deliver an optimal PCE of 17.52% with a VOC of 0.834 V, a JSC of 27.79 mA cm−2, and an FF of 75.61%, which is higher than those of D18:N3 or D18/N3 based devices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest value for SD devices to date. As shown in Fig. 2b, the BC device of D18:N3 demonstrates an EQE > 80% at 480–590 nm, suggesting efficient photocurrent generation. The EQE of D18/N3 based devices shows obvious attenuation throughout the spectrum due to the damage of the D18 film by N3 solution, while the SD device with the D18/n-octane/N3 film affords an EQE over 80% in the range of 475 nm and 590 nm, indicating that the protective solvent plays a key role in the protection of the D18 film. Obviously, the ESP method breaks the limitation of orthogonal solvents and the need for an additive, revealing independence on the ratio of donor and acceptor materials. Thus, it may be a promising method for industrial production.

To investigate the universality of the ESP method, several other non-fullerene and fullerene-based systems were studied with n-octane as the protective solvent. Photovoltaic performances of the SD and BC photovoltaic devices are presented in Tables S1–S12 (ESI†). For all nine systems, the PCEs of the SD devices reach over 90% of those of the conventional BC devices, and much higher than those of the donor/acceptor devices without protective solvents, regardless of the fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors. For example, the classic fullerene based device of PTB7-Th/n-octane/PC71BM exhibits a PCE of 8.34%, which is 98% of that of PTB7-Th:PC71BM based ones (Table 1). Obviously, the ESP method was proved to be a universal strategy for the fabrication of high performance SD devices.
Optical properties
Optical absorption spectra of the materials are presented in Fig. 3 and Fig. S4–S7 (ESI†). The D18 film exhibits an absorption band at 410–620 nm, with a peak at 584 nm and a shoulder at 548 nm, and the N3 film possesses a strong absorption peak at 840 nm (Fig. 3a), similar to the reported results.22,42 It is noted that the absorption spectra of the D18 film barely changed after spin coating of the protective solvents on top of the film (Fig. S4, ESI†), which suggests that the influence of protective solvents on the D18 film is negligible. Not surprisingly, the absorption spectra of the D18:N3 films generally resemble the overlapping of the spectra of these two compounds. However, the absorption spectra of the D18/N3 film without protective solvents show a decrease in the absorption peaks at 584 nm and 548 nm in comparison to the D18:N3 film, which is reasonably ascribed to the damage of the D18 film upon spin coating of N3 solution. Due to the protective effect of n-octane, the absorption spectra of D18/n-octane/N3 almost resemble that of the D18:N3 film (Fig. 3a).

(g and h) AFM height and phase (inseted) images of the D18 film and D18/N3 with n-octane as the protective solvent. 
Photoluminescence (PL) measurements of different thin films are illustrated in Fig. 3b and Fig. S7 (ESI†). The fluorescence spectra of the D18:N3 film reveal that the fluorescence intensities of the donor and acceptor are effectively quenched, indicating efficient charge transfer between the donor and acceptor materials. Not surprisingly, the D18/n-octane/N3 film exhibits a similar fluorescence intensity to the D18:N3 film, while the D18/N3 film without protective solvents shows a relatively stronger fluorescence intensity.
Recombination losses and charge transport properties
To investigate the bimolecular recombination dynamics in the devices, the dependence of JSC on light intensity (P) was measured.43 The α in the power-law dependence (JSC ∝ Pα) of the SD device with n-octane as the protective solvent is 0.983, which is larger than that of the BC device (0.978) and SD device without the protective solvent (0.972) (Fig. 2c). The Jph–Veff curve shows that the exciton dissociation probability of the SD device without the protective solvent (98.9%) is good, while those of the SD device with n-octane as the protective solvent (99.4%) and BC device (99.3%) are relatively higher (Fig. 2d). The carrier lifetimes (τ) under open-circuit conditions (Fig. S8, ESI†) were extracted from the TPV decay dynamics.44 The SD device with n-octane exhibits a τ value of 99.16 μs, longer than that of the BC device (82.09 μs) and the SD device without the protective solvent (69.88 μs), which suggests that SD device possesses weaker recombination. These observations suggest that the SD device with n-octane as the protective solvent shows fine charge generation and collection efficiency, and weak recombination, leading to excellent photovoltaic performance.
Furthermore, the hole mobilities (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) of the BC device, the SD device with n-octane and the SD device without protective solvent are 1.96 × 10−4/1.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.94 × 10−4/1.80 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.90 × 10−4/2.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The more balanced charge transport mobilities of the BC device (μh/μe = 1.10) and the SD device (μh/μe = 1.07) than that of the SD device without a protective solvent (μh/μe = 0.84) are in accordance with the difference in FF (Fig. S9–S11 and Table S13, ESI†).
Morphology investigation
To investigate the influence of the protective solvents on the film morphology, the thickness of the films was measured using profilometer. The thickness of PEDOT:PSS/D18/N3 is only 105.00 nm, while those of PEDOT:PSS/D18/protective solvent/N3 are obviously enhanced (∼108–133 nm), which demonstrates the excellent protective effect of the solvents (Fig. S12, ESI†).
To probe the molecular packing mode of neat and stacked films, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement was performed. The 2D GIWAXS images of neat N3 films, neat D18 films, and D18/n-octane/N3 films are presented in Fig. 3c–e. The corresponding intensity profiles of 1D GIWAXS along the in-plane (IP, dotted line) and out-of-plane (OOP, solid line) directions are shown in Fig. 3f. An OOP direction peak of neat N3 film (Fig. 3c) located at q = 1.79 Å−1 (d ∼ 3.51 Å) exhibits a strong π–π stacking, indicating a preferential face-on orientation. Diffraction peaks of N3 in the IP direction at q = 0.296 Å−1 (d ∼ 21.23 Å) can be assigned to the lamellar packing. The neat D18 film (Fig. 3d) shows a π–π stacking peak at q = 1.70 Å−1 (d ∼ 3.70 Å) and bimodal lamellar peaks in both IP and OOP directions at q = 0.301 Å−1 (d ∼ 20.9 Å). For the D18/n-octane/N3 film, a strong diffraction peak in the OOP direction at q = 1.75 Å−1 (d ∼ 3.59 Å) (Fig. 3e) is assigned to the π–π stacking of either D18 or N3. Also, the scattering peak in the IP direction at q = 0.296 Å−1 (d ∼ 21.23 Å) is attributable to the lamellar stacking of N3. These observations suggest that D18 and N3 in the D18/n-octane/N3 film have molecular packing similar to that of the neat films, which beneficial to charge transport and photovoltaic performance.
The surface morphology of the films was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The mean-square surface roughness (Rq) of the pristine D18 film is 1.59 nm, which barely changed after the spin-coating of protective solvents on top of the film, indicating that the protective solvent has little effect on the morphology of the D18 film (Fig. S13, ESI†). Moreover, the Rq value of the D18/N3 film without the protective solvent is 1.28 nm (Fig. S14, ESI†). In general, the Rq values of the D18/protective solvent/N3 films become smaller than that of the D18 film. For example, the Rq value of the D18/n-octane/N3 film decreases to 1.11 nm, suggesting a more uniform surface, beneficial for the contact and charge transfer between the active layer and the interfacial layer (Fig. 3h). The TEM image of the D18/n-octane/N3 film shows delicate bright and dark regime interpenetration, indicating the existence of fine phase separation (Fig. S15, ESI†).
To investigate the vertical phase segregation of the SD device, dynamic secondary-ion mass spectrometry (DSIMS) was used to study the distribution of the components along the direction normal to the surface by tracing the elements of individual material.45 Due to the absence of characteristic elements between D18 and N3, the PM7 and Y6 system is chosen to be investigated with DSIMS, since PM7 and Y6 possess the characteristic elements Cl and F, respectively (Fig. S16, ESI†). Since aluminum (Al) atoms, indium (or tin) and sulfo group are unique to Al electrode, ITO glass and PEDOT:PSS, respectively, we can easily identify these characteristics to trace the location of the materials in the SD device (Fig. S16a, ESI†). The region of carbon (C) element is reasonably assigned to the film of PEDOT:PSS/PM7/n-octane/Y6/PDINO. According to the sulfo group distribution of PEDOT:PSS, we can roughly define the PM7/n-octane/Y6/PDNIO position at t/tmax of 0.65–0.75. Thus, the intensity change of F and Cl can be found at t/tmax of 0.65–0.75 (Fig. S16b, ESI†). Obviously, Y6 acceptors are assembled at the air surface, while PM7 polymer donors are enriched at the bottom of the SD device. Moreover, the region with t/tmax of 0.676–0.723 shows the interpenetration of Y6 and PM7. Thus, the SD device possesses a fine vertical phase separation with a p–i–n structure, which is in accordance with the SEM cross-section images of the PM7/n-octane/Y6 system (Fig. S17, ESI†), beneficial to the photovoltaic performance.
Voltage losses of the SD device based on the D18/n-octane/N3 film
The energy losses of different parts of the SD device with n-octane as the protective solvent are shown in Fig. 4. As shown in eqn (1), the energy loss can be divided into three parts:46 (1)in which ΔE1, ΔE2 and ΔE3 are the radiative loss above the bandgap, the radiative loss below the bandgap, and the nonradiative loss, respectively.47 Detailed energy losses of the device are summarized in Table S14 (ESI†). For the SD device with n-octane as the protective solvent, radiative loss above the bandgap (0.26 eV) is unavoidable, which can be obtained according to the Eg and maximum voltage (VSQoc) calculated by the SQ limit. Radiative loss below the bandgap calculated by VSQoc and open-circuit voltage (Vradoc) is 0.05 eV, when only radiative recombination existed. The nonradiative loss can be acquired by measuring the EQEEL of the relevant optimal SD device using eqn (2):48 ΔE3 = qΔVnon-radoc = −kTln(EQEEL)(2)

A high EQEEL value of 2.76 × 10−5 corresponds to a low nonradiative loss (0.27 eV) of the SD device based on D18/n-octane/N3 film. In addition, the low energy loss (0.58 eV) is beneficial to the photovoltaic performance of the SD device.
Investigation of solvent protection mechanism
As discussed above, different protective solvents can influence the optical properties and morphology of the donor/protective solvent/acceptor film and the photovoltaic performance of SD devices. Thus, it is important to probe the mechanism of the ESP method. Obviously, the protective solvents which cannot be fully volatilized before spin-coating of the acceptor solution need to be well spread on top of the donor film. Thus, the spreading coefficient (S) and saturated vapor pressure (P) of the protective solvents are the key parameters to determine the protective effect. First, the equation of spreading coefficient (S) can be represented as:49 (3)where  is the surface tension of the solvent, and θ is the contact angle of the protective solvent on top of the donor film. Photographs of contact angles of eight solvents on top of D18, PM6, PM7, PBDB-T, PTB7-Th and P3HT films are presented in Fig. 5a and Fig. S18 (ESI†). According to eqn (3), all S values of different protective solvents on various donor films are calculated to be negative (Table 2 and Table S15, ESI†). Note that the liquid drop can spread on the film spontaneously with S ≥ 0.50,51 With the negative value of S, the closer the value of S is to 0, the easier the protective solvent spreads on the donor film. Thus, alkanes including n-hexane, n-heptane, and n-octane spread on the surface of the donor films more easily than DMSO and DMF.

Saturated vapor pressure (P) of the solvent is another key factor to evaluate the protective effect of solvents on top of the donor films. According to the Clausius–Clapeyron equation, the integral form is shown as below:52 (4)where ΔvapHm is the molar enthalpy of vaporization of the protective solvent, which is identified as a fixed value here. T is Kelvin temperature, R is the molar gas constant, and C is a constant. Thus, lnP (or logP) and 1/T possess a linear relationship (Fig. S19 and Table S16, ESI†). Note the saturated vapor pressures of the protective solvents at multiple temperatures can be easily found in the solvent handbook. The lower the P of the protective solvent is, the less volatile it is.
To combine these two parameters S and P, a novel parameter, protective factor (δ), is proposed to describe the protective effect of eco-solvents on the donor films. The equation of δ can be represented as: (5)
The protective factors of eight protective solvents on top of the D18, PM6, PM7, PBDB-T, PTB7-Th and P3HT films are summarized in Table 2 and Table S17 (ESI†). The D18 system is chosen as the example to investigate the relationship between PCE and δ. Fig. 5b shows the quantitative relationship between δ and PCE of the D18/solvent/N3 system, which shows a strong exponential relationship with a (R-squared) correlation coefficient of 0.9510. In general, the closer the δ value is to zero, the higher the PCE is. Moreover, the quantitative relationship between δ and PCE of other systems is investigated. Impressively, all plots of PCE-δ of other eight systems exhibit a strong exponential relationship with a (R-squared) correlation coefficient above 0.9 (Fig. S20, ESI†), suggesting the universality of the protective factor. Thus, the protective factor (δ) can be used to assess the effect of protective solvent on device performance and predict the PCE of the SD device with different protective solvents.
Conclusions
In summary, an ESP method with an eco-friendly solvent as the protective agent is developed for the construction of high performance OSCs with stacked structures. Nine donor/acceptor system based SD devices present over 90% of the PCE of the donor:acceptor based BC devices when n-octane is used as the protective solvent, which proved the universality of the ESP method in constructing high performance OSCs. Impressively, the device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/D18/N3/PDINO/Al with n-octane as the protective solvent affords a PCE of 17.52%, which is the record value for SD devices. Furthermore, a new parameter named protective factor (δ) is proposed to describe the protective effect of the solvents, which presents the exponential relationship with PCE with a (R-squared) correlation coefficient over 0.9. This contribution presents a novel method for the construction of high performance SD photovoltaic devices, and offers in-depth understanding of the mechanism.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are at the dawn of commercialization. The construction of OSCs with stacked structures by sequential deposition (SD) of donor and acceptor films has great potential in industrial production. Thus, various methods including vacuum deposition, film-transfer, and a multiple spin-coating process with orthogonal solvents have been employed to fabricate stacked OSCs, which usually have various limitations for general applications. Herein, a universal method was developed for the fabrication of high performance stacked OSCs, which employed eco-friendly solvents as a protective layer (ESP) between the donor and acceptor layers. By tuning the spreading coefficient (S) and saturated vapor pressure (P) of the protective solvents, a record PCE of 17.52% for SD devices was achieved when n-octane was used as the protective solvent. Furthermore, a novel protective factor (δ) is proposed based on S and P, which presented a quantitative relationship with PCE with a (R-squared) correlation coefficient over 0.9. This factor is important to understand the mechanism and provides a guideline for the application of this ESP method.
