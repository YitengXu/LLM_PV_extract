In this work, based on very recently synthesized ultrathin anatase TiO2 nanowires, we explore the possibility of these wires as photocatalysts for photoelectrochemical water-splitting via the mono-doping (C, N, V, and Cr) and n–p codoping (C&V, C&Cr, N&V, and N&Cr) schemes. Our first-principles calculations predict that the C&Cr and C&V codoped ANWs may be strong candidates for photoelectrochemical water-splitting, because they have a substantially reduced band gap of 2.49 eV, appropriate band edge positions, no carrier recombination centers, and enhanced optical absorption in the visible light region.I. IntroductionPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting into hydrogen driven by visible light is one of the most desirable goals in energy and environmental science.1–4 Since the pioneering work of Fujishima and Honda,5 TiO2, as a very promising photocatalyst for solar energy utilization, has received extensive attention both experimentally and theoretically.6 However, as a wide band gap (3.2 eV) semiconductor, bulk TiO2 can only absorb the ultraviolet light, which accounts for a very small percentage (3–5%) of the solar energy. To expand the spectral response of TiO2 to the visible light (45%) region, great efforts have been made on its band gap optimization by utilizing impurity doping schemes (see reviews 2, 7, and 8 and references therein). Proper selection of cation or anion dopants for TiO2 will create donor or acceptor levels below conduction band minimum (CBM) or above valence band maximum (VBM), broadening the solar absorption spectra.9–14 However, the thermodynamic solubility of the mono-dopants in TiO2 is usually rather low, which limits the carrier concentration.15 Moreover, the partially filled mono-doping levels will act as carrier recombination centers resulting in the loss of the excited carriers; their strong localization will reduce the carrier mobility and thereby lower the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency in mono-doping systems.16 Fortunately, n–p codoping has been proved to be an effective way to narrow the band gap, increase the dopant concentration, and passivate the defect bands simultaneously;15–25 these advantages are ascribed to the coulomb interaction and charge compensation effects between the neighboring anion and cation dopants.Besides having a suitable band gap, the appropriate band edge position of a photocatalyst also plays a vital role in PEC water-splitting. As the CBM of bulk TiO2 is only slightly higher than the potential of the hydrogenation production reaction (H+/H2, see Fig. 1), limited donor–acceptor combinations can be chosen to ensure the reaction towards hydrogen production.23 In fact, many 3d transition metal dopants are found to shift the CBM down below the H+/H2 potential.23 Therefore, if the CBM of the host TiO2 can be lifted, more candidates of n–p pairs are then expected. Fig. 1  Band edge alignments of bulk anatase TiO246 and the ANW with respect to the potentials for hydrogen production reaction and water oxidation reaction. Owing to quantum confinement effects, the band gaps of low dimensional nanostructures are generally larger than their corresponding bulk phase, basically reflected in the up-shift of the CBM.26 In recent years, one dimensional (1D) nanostructures such as nanotubes, nanowires and nanorods as water-splitting photocatalysts have been attracting ever-growing interest due to their intriguing physical and chemical properties, such as good charge transport, low charge carrier recombination losses and enhanced light absorption efficiencies.14,27–39 Indeed, the water photoelectrolysis photoconversion efficiency of highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays is as high as 16.25% under UV illumination.28,32,40–42 The maximum photoconversion efficiency of TiO2 nanowires increases more than twofold than that of TiO2 bulk and thin films.27,29 A photoconversion efficiency of 5.02% is achieved under an AM 1.5 illumination using single crystal rutile TiO2 nanowire arrays as the photoelectrode, whereas vertically aligned anatase TiO2 nanowires on a conductive substrate yield a photoconversion efficiency of 2.87% even without the optimization of the wire height.43 A wide variety of nano compositions including Fe2O3, WO3, ZnO, VO2, BiVO4 nanowires and Ti–Fe–O, Cu–Ti–O, Ta3N5, TaON nanotubes have been reported to possibly address the short charge diffusion challenge and the mismatch of the electronic energy levels as well.30Very recently, atomically thin wires of anatase TiO2 with the diameter range of 4–5 Å have been successfully synthesized through a scalable chemical solution method;44,45 the structure is a single anatase unit cell growing along the [001] direction (see the right panel of Fig. 1). Such a thin 1D nanostructure should have a strong quantum confinement effect, which might provide more space to engineer the band gap and the band edge positions for better PEC water-splitting performance. In this work, we take this ultra-thin anatase TiO2 nanowire (ANW) as the host and consider different dopants to tailor its band gap and band edges within the framework of spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT). Both the mono-doping (C, N, V, and Cr) and the n–p codoping including compensated (C&Cr and N&V) and noncompensated (C&V and N&Cr) codoping are taken into account. The C&Cr and C&V codoped ANWs with suitable band gaps (2.49 eV), proper band edge positions, the absence of carrier recombination centers and increased optical absorption in the visible light region may be good candidates for promising visible-light PEC water-splitting.II. MethodologyThe DFT calculations were performed within the spin-polarized local-density approximation (LSDA) considering the projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials, as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).47,48 We applied the LSDA + U method to treat the 3d electrons of transition metals,49 and the Hubbard U parameters (4.1, 2.2, and 6.8 eV for Ti, V, and Cr, respectively) were chosen to reproduce the experimental band gaps of anatase TiO2 (3.2 eV),26 rutile TiO2 (3.0 eV),50 V2O5 (2.0 eV) and Cr2O3 (3.4 eV).51 Both the atomic positions and unit cell parameters were fully relaxed until the forces on each atom were less than 0.01 eV Å−1. We used a 1 × 1 × 2 supercell containing 54 atoms to simulate the ANW, caved out from bulk anatase TiO2 along the [0001] direction (see Fig. 2a). A Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh of 1 × 1 × 3 for ANWs and an energy cutoff of 450 eV were adopted for the optimization of the structures and denser k points of 1 × 1 × 7 were used to obtain accurate density of states and band gaps. The optimized lattice parameters for the anatase TiO2 bulk (a = 3.750 Å, c = 9.485 Å) are in good agreement with the experimental values (a = 3.785 Å, c = 9.502 Å),52 which establishes the validation of the computational scheme employed here. Fig. 2  (a) The ANW supercell model caved out from the 4 × 4 × 2 supercell of bulk TiO2. The nonequivalent Ti (O) atoms in the ANW are labeled with i, ii, and iii (1, 2, 3 and 4), respectively. (b) The top view of the relaxed ANW. The sequential connection of the peripheral O atoms with lines shows an octagon, the circumcircle of which has a diameter of ∼5.8 Å. To compare the Kohn–Sham levels of the pure and doped ANWs from different DFT calculations, we exploited a band alignment procedure by calculating the mean electrostatic potential as a function of the distance from the ANW axis. The computational procedure is described in detail in ref. 53 and is briefly mentioned here: (1) calculate the electrostatic potential distribution of the nanowire supercell; (2) compute the average values of the electrostatic potentials on the surface of a number of cylinders with different radius R coaxial to the nanowire axis (i.e. z axis) and plot the average electrostatic potential versus R; (3) the average electrostatic potential far away from the z axis (the vacuum region) tends to be a constant (denoted by Ev) which is defined as the vacuum level and shifted to zero; and finally, (4) subtracting Ev from the energy of the VBM gives the absolute position of the VBM, whereas adding the LDA + U band gap to the absolute value of the VBM determines the position of the CBM.III. Results and discussionThe optimized ANW belongs to the P-4M2 space group and contains four nonequivalent O atoms and three nonequivalent Ti atoms; it has a diameter of ∼5.8 Å and an octagonal cross section (see Fig. 2), consistent with previous results.54 The CBM (VBM) of the ANW shifts up (down) by 0.40 (0.12) eV as compared with that of the bulk TiO2; consequently, the band gap of this ANW increases to 3.72 eV (see Fig. 1). Similar to the bulk phase of TiO2, the valence and conduction bands of the ANW are mainly comprised of O 2p and Ti 3d orbitals (see Fig. 3a). The large up-shift of the CBM towards the vacuum energy level is expected to enhance the reducing power of TiO2 for hydrogen production and relax the stringent requirements on the choice of the dopants aforementioned.

The grey shaded area denotes the DOS of TiO2 excluding the dopants; the magnitude of the DOS from the dopant atoms is tripled and highlighted by different colors and shadings; the dotted line refers to the Fermi level. Eg (Ei) is the energy difference between the highest occupied band level and the lowest unoccupied band minimum (between the VBM and CBM of the host). A. Mono-doping in the ANWWe considered four kinds of substitution, e.g., a V or Cr atom replacing a Ti atom as the n-type dopant, and a C or N atom replacing an O atom as the p-type dopant. For each system, all the nonequivalent doping sites were taken into consideration; the cations and anions prefer to occupy the Ti (iii) and O (4) sites, respectively (see Fig. 2a). Fig. 3b–e plots the DOS of the C, N, V and Cr mono-doped ANWs and Fig. 4 displays the band edge alignments with respect to the vacuum energy level. The band gaps of the mono-doped ANWs are reduced to a different extent. Note that the band gap (Eg) defined here is the energy difference between the highest occupied band level (i.e. the Fermi level) and the lowest unoccupied band minimum, including the intermediate bands (IBs), whereas the energy difference between VBM and CBM of the host is defined as the intrinsic band gap (Ei). Ei of all mono-doping here could not be narrowed, even a little enlarged, which is also observed in previous calculations for the bulk doping.55,56 Fig. 4  Band edge alignments of the pure ANW and its doping systems. The upper (blue)/lower (red) short lines denote the positions of CBM/VBM and the numbers above them are the corresponding values with respect to the vacuum energy level; the grey short lines between the CBM and VBM are the defect intermediate bands; the gray areas show the band tail states. The blue and red dotted lines refer to the positions of the potentials for hydrogen production (H+/H2) and water oxidation (O2/H2O), respectively. Nitrogen doped bulk TiO2 has been one of the most extensively studied photocatalysts due to its visible light sensitivity.9,16,55,57,58 With regard to the explanation of the visible light response of N-substituted TiO2, there are differences of view depending on the type of DFT methods. For example, Gai et al.,16 employing periodic DFT, gave acceptor states overlapping with the VBM, which is considered to reduce the band gap for the visible light response, whereas DFT + U studies predicted isolated states above the VBM, i.e. IBs induce the visible light response.55 The prediction of DFT + U is closer to the results of experiments than that of periodic DFT. For the ANW, our LDA + U calculations show that the substitutional N introduces an IB, located at 0.87 eV above the Fermi level; besides, another more delocalized band close to the valence band edge (Fig. 3c) is a hybridization orbital of the N 2p states and O 2p states. This IB is beneficial for extending the absorption edge to the visible light region, since the electrons in the VB can be excited to it and then subsequently excited to the CB by visible light photons; on the other hand, owing to the fact that it is empty, this IB is believed to promote the recombination rate of holes and electrons. For C doping, due to the C 2p orbital energy being higher than that of N 2p, it has been observed that C 2p acceptor states lie deeper in the band gap for C doped TiO2. Similar to earlier predictions of substitutional doping in bulk TiO2,59 the C dopant in the ANW creates three localized bands located at the VBM, across and 1.23 eV above the Fermi level, respectively, and they are mainly of C 2p character. Particularly, the band located at the VBM is somewhat overlapping with the VBM.For the cation (V or Cr) doped ANW, due to the V or Cr 3d orbital energy being lower than that of Ti 3d, the impurity states are introduced at the CBM hybridizing with the Ti 3d states and below the CBM. Moreover, Cr 3d states extend so much that they mix with the O 2p states and produce a small peak at the VBM, which was also predicted by other theoretical calculations for bulk doping.60,61 The electronic configuration of Cr is 3d54s1. When Cr is in the octahedral coordination field with a low spin (t2g)5, which is a triply degenerate electronic ground state, removal of this degeneracy occurs according to the Jahn–Teller effect. The split Cr t2g appears to be more delocalized, forming hybridized states with O 2p and Ti 3d. These hybridized states are strongly in favor of the migration of photoexcited carriers in the process of photocatalysis. Due to the presence of the IB in the band gap of the ANW, 1.14 eV below the CBM for the V doping or 0.43 eV above the VBM for the Cr doping, the response of these two cases to the visible light photons is expected. However, these IBs are partially filled, by which the lifetime of photoexcited carriers will be reduced, and thus the quantum yields are decreased significantly.B. Compensated and noncompensated codoping in the ANWFrom the above discussion, one can see that in all of the mono-doped ANWs empty or partially filled localized IBs are introduced, which may facilitate the nonradiative recombination of the carriers.3 To reduce or eliminate the recombination centers, a compensated n–p codoping method has been proposed.16 Meanwhile, a noncompensated n–p codoping approach was recently developed15 to utilize the IB states to narrow the band gap and enhance the visible photoactivity.15,62 Therefore, we will consider both the compensated and noncompensated n–p codoping schemes below.For the anion–cation substitutional codoping, the cation and anion prefer to occupy the Ti and the neighboring O lattice sites, respectively, which have been verified to be the most energetically favorable in earlier studies.15–17,63 To evaluate the stability of the anion–cation codoping pairs with respect to the isolated dopants, we calculated the defect pair binding energy, defined as64Eb = E(n doped ANW) + E(p doped ANW) − E(n&p codoped ANW) − E(ANW)Positive Eb means that the n–p pair is more stable than the corresponding mono-doped ones. The binding energies for the C&Cr, N&V, C&V, and N&Cr pairs are 3.01, 2.20, 1.88 and 2.00 eV, respectively, showing that the n–p dopant pairs tend to bind to each other and the compensated codoping enhances the stability better than the noncompensated one. The large binding energies arise from charge transfer between the n–p dopant pairs, and also between the dopant and its adjacent atoms. This charge transfer can be confirmed by the Bader charges, summarized in Table 1. Taking the C&Cr-codoped ANW for example approaches further about this charge transfer: the C dopant has a charge of −0.77e for the mono-doping, while it is −0.87e for codoping, gaining more electrons; the Cr dopant reduces the oxidation number relative to mono-doping, i.e. gaining more electrons, too. A possible explanation for the charge transfer situation of C&Cr-codoping is that these two dopants form a bond with the covalent character, which can be confirmed by their significant overlapping of the dopant DOS in Fig. 3f. From Fig. 3g–i one can see that the impurity states of the other every dopant pair are well hybridized with each other, and this implies that the dopant pair forms a covalent bond.

In this the nanophase morphology material is not all the same as the bulk one through our codoping calculations. For the compensated C&Cr-doped ANW, the dopant states locate at the band edges of the host ANW overlapping with them and spread away (Fig. 3f), without creating IB states. This hybrid effect is very much in favor of the migration of photoexcited carriers and the process of photocatalysis.56 Whereas, the compensated N&V-doping in the ANW induces the empty IB ∼0.50 eV below the CBM, different from the bulk case with a “clean” gap;16,21,65 these intermediate states may result from the quantum confinement inducing the noncompensated charges.66 As expected, both of the noncompensated, codoped ANWs (C&V and N&Cr) have IBs (Fig. 3h and i). The N&Cr doping in the ANW creates two IBs about 0.60 eV away for the two band edges, respectively, with one partially filled and the other empty. Whereas, in the C&V doped ANW the only one impurity band lying about 1.02 eV above the VBM is completely filled with electrons, and the other impurity states either locate at the CBM of the host ANW overlapping with it or become broadened within the CB and VB. The fully filled IB is extremely beneficial for suppressing the formation of recombination centers just because of occupied electrons, as well as IB-to-band transitions possibly excited by lower energy photons.The band gaps of the four n–p codoped cases are all reduced compared with that of the pure ANW and the positions of the band edges also meet the thermodynamic requirements of the water-splitting reaction except for the N&Cr doping (see Fig. 4). Especially, the C&Cr and C&V doping reduces the band gap substantially from 3.72 eV of the pure ANW to 2.49 eV, suggesting that it might be good for the visible light adsorption and the spontaneous, efficient water-splitting reaction.C. Optical absorption of the codoping in the ANWTo provide further evidence, we calculated optical absorption spectra of the four n–p codoped ANWs. The absorption coefficient of a material is given by α = 2πε2/(nλ), where n is the refractive index (since n varies with λ within a very small range, i.e. 2.4–2.6, we take n = 2.54 at 550 nm in the calculations67,68). In the electrodipole approximation, the imaginary part of the dielectric function ε2 is expressed as  where c and v represent the conduction and the valence band states, p is the momentum operator, H is the external field vector, and |c, k〉 and |v, k〉 denote the unoccupied and occupied wave functions at point k in reciprocal space. Fig. 5 displays the absorption coefficients α as a function of wavelength λ for the pure and the n–p codoped ANWs. It is clear that the pure ANW has no absorption in the visible light region and responds only to UV light photons. As compared with the pure ANW, the four n–p dopant pairs can help enhance the intensity of the intrinsic absorption, since the n–p dopant pairs can modify the band edges of the ANW (see Fig. 3), increasing the DOS of band edges; all four n–p codoped systems show red-shift of the absorption edges, which results from the IBs or the band gap reduction. For the N&V codoped case, the absorption peak (∼380 nm), corresponding to the transition from N 2p to Ti 3d and/or V 3d states of the CBM, lies in the UV spectrum region yet. Despite the N&Cr codoped ANW having one peak (∼430 nm) in the visible light region, it associates with the empty IB transitions (see Fig. 3i), so most of the resulting hole-electron pairs will be annihilated by the empty IB itself. For the C&V codoped case, there are two peaks associated with IB transitions: one lies at ∼360 nm and the other at ∼480 nm. Different from N&Cr doping, IBs in the C&V codoped ANW cannot become the killers of the excited hole–electron pairs owing to either occupied by electrons fully or overlapping with the band edges forming band tail states. These results suggest that noncompensated n–p codoping may have a better optical adsorption towards improving solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. This opinion is consistent with the stepping-stone model proposed by Zhu et al. according to which the presence of the IBs can effectively narrow the band gap and thereby enhance the visible photoactivity of TiO2.15 The C&Cr codoped ANW also exhibits the visible light photoactivity. Moreover, all of its IBs form band tail states, which can be documented by the presence of only one peak (∼410 nm) caused by the impurity absorption. Fig. 5  Calculated optical absorption spectra for the pure and n–p codoped C&Cr-, N&V-, C&V-, N&Cr-ANWs. Based on the above analysis, the C&Cr and C&V codoped ANWs may be the most promising candidates for highly efficient water-splitting photocatalysis considering the following four advantages: (1) the band gap is reduced to 2.49 eV; (2) the CBM of the C&Cr (C&V) doping is 0.13 (0.35) eV above the potential for the hydrogen production reaction and the VBM lies 1.13 (0.86) eV below the potential for the oxygen production reaction, which meets the thermodynamic requirements of water photolysis; (3) the optical absorption is greatly red-shifted to the visible light region; (4) the absence of the empty or partly occupied IBs in the band gap should notably reduce the recombination of photon-generated electron–hole pairs and achieve a better quantum yield.Finally, to examine the effect of the supercell size on the photocatalytic property of the C&Cr and C&V codoped cases, we doubled the diameter of the ANW. The relaxed new larger ANW (LANW) with a reduction of the band gap by ∼0.1 eV relative to the ANW also has an octagonal cross section. To be consistent with the above, the lowest-energy C&Cr and C&V codoped configurations in the LANW will be used to calculate the electronic structures of these two doped systems. Their DOS is reported in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 clearly shows that the four advantages of the C&Cr and C&V codoped ANWs are maintained in the corresponding codoped LANW.

Eg (Ei) is the energy difference between the highest occupied band level and the lowest unoccupied band minimum (between the VBM and CBM of the host). IV. ConclusionIn summary, we have studied the electronic structures of the doped anatase phase TiO2 nanowires including the mono-doping (C-, N-, V-, Cr-doped) and codoping (noncompensated C&V- and N&Cr-doped; compensated N&V- and C&Cr-doped) by employing LSDA + U. Both the mono-doping and codoping can efficiently tune the band gaps and band edges of ANWs to match visible light absorption and the hydrogen or oxygen production levels. Especially, the compensated C&Cr and noncompensated C&V codoping narrow the band gap of ANWs to 2.49 eV without introducing additional recombination centers, which should be a good candidate for PEC water-splitting. The excellent performance of the C&Cr and C&V codoped ANWs is further demonstrated by the increased optical absorption in the visible light region. These interesting findings are fundamentally intriguing in their own right, and may also stimulate the experiments to synthesize new functionalized materials for better PEC water splitting.AcknowledgementsThis work is supported by the NBRP (2011CB302004, 2010CB923401), NSF (11074035, 21173040, 11247285) and the NSF of Jiangsu (BK2012322) of China.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Band edge alignments of bulk anatase TiO246 and the ANW with respect to the potentials for hydrogen production reaction and water oxidation reaction.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) The ANW supercell model caved out from the 4 × 4 × 2 supercell of bulk TiO2. The nonequivalent Ti (O) atoms in the ANW are labeled with i, ii, and iii (1, 2, 3 and 4), respectively. (b) The top view of the relaxed ANW. The sequential connection of the peripheral O atoms with lines shows an octagon, the circumcircle of which has a diameter of ∼5.8 Å.	 

 	Fig. 3  DOS of the pure ANW (a) and the C-, N-, V-, Cr-, C&Cr-, N&V-, C&V-, N&Cr-doped ANW (b–i). The grey shaded area denotes the DOS of TiO2 excluding the dopants; the magnitude of the DOS from the dopant atoms is tripled and highlighted by different colors and shadings; the dotted line refers to the Fermi level. Eg (Ei) is the energy difference between the highest occupied band level and the lowest unoccupied band minimum (between the VBM and CBM of the host).	 

 	Fig. 4  Band edge alignments of the pure ANW and its doping systems. The upper (blue)/lower (red) short lines denote the positions of CBM/VBM and the numbers above them are the corresponding values with respect to the vacuum energy level; the grey short lines between the CBM and VBM are the defect intermediate bands; the gray areas show the band tail states. The blue and red dotted lines refer to the positions of the potentials for hydrogen production (H+/H2) and water oxidation (O2/H2O), respectively.	 
Eb = E(n doped ANW) + E(p doped ANW) − E(n&p codoped ANW) − E(ANW)

p	−0.98	−0.77	 	 	−0.87	−1.10	−0.86	−0.93
n	 	 	2.09	1.85	1.68	2.10	1.95	1.82
Ti	2.11	2.03	 	 	2.07	2.11	2.04	2.12
O	 	 	−1.04	−0.96	−0.91	−1.04	−1.04	−0.97

 		 

 	Fig. 5  Calculated optical absorption spectra for the pure and n–p codoped C&Cr-, N&V-, C&V-, N&Cr-ANWs.	 

 	Fig. 6  DOS of C&Cr- and C&V-doped LANW. The grey shaded area denotes the DOS of TiO2 excluding the dopants; the magnitude of the DOS from the dopant atoms is tenfold and highlighted by different colors and shadings; the dotted line refers to the Fermi level. Eg (Ei) is the energy difference between the highest occupied band level and the lowest unoccupied band minimum (between the VBM and CBM of the host).
