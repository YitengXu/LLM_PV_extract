    , Accepted 18th February 2013First published on 18th February 2013AbstractHeteroleptic ruthenium(II) sensitizers DV42 and DV51, encompassing a novel unsymmetrical pyridine-quinoline hybrid ligand with extended π-conjugation, were synthesized, characterized, and utilized in nanocrystalline dye-sensitized solar cells. Due to the extended conjugation of DV42 and DV51, the absorption of the corresponding sensitized TiO2 films extends into the red spectral range, shifted by 30–40 nm relative to the absorption of TiO2 films sensitized with the standard Z907 ruthenium(II) dye. Contact angle measurements of DV42- and DV51-sensitized TiO2 films suggest that these films are hydrophilic with contact angle values commonly observed upon sensitization with the standard N3 ruthenium(II) dye. Electrochemical studies of the novel ruthenium(II) dyes show that their first oxidation potentials lie well below the I−/I3− redox potential allowing easy regeneration. The excited-state oxidation potentials of both dyes lie above the TiO2 conduction band, permitting efficient electron injection from the excited dye molecules into the semiconductor conduction band. Liquid electrolyte dye-sensitized solar cells incorporating DV42- or DV51-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes afford overall power conversion efficiencies of 3.24 or 4.36% respectively. These efficiencies are up to 56% of the power conversion efficiencies attained by TiO2 photoelectrodes sensitized by the benchmark Z907 ruthenium(II) dye under similar experimental conditions.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) provide an appealing alternative to the conventional solid-state cells.1 This is mainly due to their ability to function indoors and under low light conditions, their potential transparency and flexibility, their invariant efficiency with the operating temperature, and their relatively low production cost.2 A DSC device is comprised of two facing electrodes: the photoanode, which is transparent, consists of a thin nanoparticulate film of a mesoporous large band gap semiconductor deposited on conductive glass. A monolayer of sensitizer (dye) molecules is chemically grafted onto the semiconductor through anchoring functionalities such as carboxylic or phosphonic acids. An electrolyte containing a redox couple is placed between the photoelectrode and the cathode, typically comprised of platinum deposited onto conductive glass, to transfer the charges.
The dye, which is the heart of the DSC device, undergoes transition from its ground to its excited state upon light absorption. One electron is then injected from the dye into the conduction band of the semiconductor, resulting in an oxidized dye molecule. Ideally, the photoinjected electrons percolate through the nanoparticulate network and get collected at the back contact. They subsequently flow through the external circuit performing useful work and eventually arrive at the counter electrode. The oxidized dye is regenerated to its ground state by taking an electron from the redox couple, which is in turn reduced at the counter electrode completing the circuit. The device maximum voltage (Vmax) that can be generated equals the difference between the semiconductor Fermi level and the electron mediator species’ redox potential. The result of this regenerative cycle is the conversion of photons to electrons, while no chemical species undergo permanent transformations.
Charge generation, i.e., the injection of an electron from the dye into the conduction band of the semiconductor, is one of the most important steps in the DSC photoelectrochemical cycle. The “ideal” dye has to fulfill a variety of photophysical, structural, and electrochemical requirements: (i) a broad, strong absorption extending from the visible to the near-infrared; (ii) chemical stability in its ground, excited, and oxidized states; (iii) its excited state should not be deactivated through the emission of heat or light; (iv) an irreversible adsorption onto the surface of the semiconductor; (v) a strong electronic coupling between its excited state and the semiconductor's conduction band to ensure efficient electron injection; (vi) an excited-state oxidation potential sufficiently higher (by about 150–200 mV)3 than the semiconductor conduction band edge in order to result in an effective electron injection; and (vii) a ground-state reduction potential sufficiently lower (by about 200–300 mV)3 than the redox potential of the electron mediator species, in order to be regenerated rapidly.
Although many different compounds have been utilized as sensitizers in DSC applications,2 Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes comprise the most successful family of DSC dyes in terms of both photovoltaic performance and long-term stability. N3 and N719 (Fig. 1) were the first high performance Ru(II) sensitizers to be reported.4N3 and N719, which differ only in their protonation state, afford a very high conversion of incident photons into electric current over a large spectral range, giving DSCs with overall power conversion efficiencies of 10.0% and 11.2% respectively. The higher power conversion efficiency of N719, when compared to the tetra-protonated parent dye N3, originates from the increased cell voltage. The structural fine-tuning of these early Ru(II) polypyridyl dyes has led to even more efficient sensitizers with amphiphilic properties and extended conjugation that achieve power conversion efficiencies up to 12.3%. Thus, CYC-B1 (Fig. 1), reported in 2006, bears a highly conjugated ligand substituted with alkyl bithiophene groups.5 The overall power conversion efficiency of CYC-B1 was reported to be 8.5%, 10% higher than that of N3 under the same cell fabrication and measuring conditions. Z991, the mono(tetrabutylammonium) salt of CYC-B1 (Fig. 1), holds the 12.3% DSC power conversion efficiency record. This was achieved with phosphinate amphiphile dineohexyl bis-(3,3-dimethyl-butyl)-phosphinic acid (DINHOP) as the co-adsorbent.6

The structural and photoelectrochemical properties of a Ru(II) polypyridyl dye and, therefore, its efficiency in a DSC are dictated by the coordinated ligands. As part of our ongoing work in the development of novel Ru(II) photosensitizers for DSC applications,7 we herein report the synthesis, characterization, and sensitizing ability evaluation of two new Ru(II) dyes (DV42 and DV51, Fig. 2). DV42 and DV51 bear a novel pyridine-quinoline hybrid ligand with extended aromatic conjugation. The unsymmetrical, bidentate pyridine-quinoline ligand in DV42 and DV51 was designed with a long aromatic moiety. This novel architecture should facilitate an increased extinction coefficient of the main metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band of its Ru(II) complexes and an increased response to red light in the corresponding sensitized TiO2 electrodes.5,8 Moreover, this ligand scaffold was constructed in order to enable the detailed study of the influence of exceedingly long aromatic moieties on the hydrophobicity and wettability of the corresponding Ru(II) polypyridyl dyes.

Experimental
Materials
Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were purchased from Aldrich. Solvents were purchased from Fluka or Panreac and used without further purification. A dichloro(p-cymene)ruthenium(II) dimer was purchased from Alfa Aesar. 2,2′-Bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (H2dcbpy) was obtained from Dyesol. Acetonitrile, used in the electrochemical studies, was degassed by a freeze–pump–thaw cycle and stirred overnight over P2O5, at room temperature, under an argon atmosphere. It was then distilled under argon and degassed again via another freeze–pump–thaw cycle, before being stored over activated 4 Å molecular sieves. DMF, used in the electrochemical studies, was degassed by a freeze–pump–thaw cycle and stirred overnight over activated MgSO4, at room temperature, under an argon atmosphere. A further quantity of activated MgSO4 was added and DMF was then distilled under reduced pressure, before being stored over activated 4 Å molecular sieves. All synthetic reactions were performed under an argon atmosphere in degassed (15 min of argon bubbling) solvents. cis-Diisothiocyanato-(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)-(4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bipyridine) ruthenium(II) dye (Z907, Fig. 3) was purchased from Dyesol.

Analytical measurements

1H, 13C, HSQC, and COSY Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained with a Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer in (CD3)2SO or CDCl3. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm downfield from Me4Si, by using the residual solvent peak as an internal standard. Data for NMR spectra are reported as follows: chemical shift (δ ppm), multiplicity, and integration. Electronic spectra (UV-vis) in solution [5 × 10−5 M in ethanol (DV51 and Z907) or DMF (DV42)] were recorded with a Hitachi 3010 spectrophotometer in standard 1 cm path length cuvettes. Diffuse reflectance (R%) and transmittance (T%) UV-vis spectra of the dye-sensitized TiO2 films (for this purpose one layer of a transparent Dyesol paste was doctor-bladed onto microscopy glass) were obtained on the same instrument using an integrating sphere with 60 mm diameter and were transformed in absorbance (A%) units (A% = 100 − R% − T%). Infrared spectra (FTIR) in the powder form were obtained using an FTIR Nicolet 6700 spectrometer. Data for FTIR spectra are reported as follows: frequency (cm−1) and strength (s = strong; m = medium; w = weak). Despite our repeated attempts, we were unable to get reliable Elemental Analysis data for the newly synthesized complexes, possibly due to insufficient combustion. High Resolution Mass Spectra (HRMS) were recorded using a Bruker Daltonics APEXIV 4.7 Tesla Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass spectrometer. Micro-Raman spectra were measured in the backscattering configuration using a Renishaw inVia spectrometer with an excitation at 514.5 nm by an Ar+ ion laser. In all cases, very low laser power density (0.01 mW μm−2) was applied in order to avoid dye degradation and thermal shifts of the modes. The advancing contact angle of water droplets on the films was measured with a Contact Angle Meter (CAM) 100, KSV Instruments, Ltd, equipped with a horizontal microscope and a protractor eyepiece. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed in 10−3 M solutions of the corresponding complexes in acetonitrile (DV42) or DMF (DV51) containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBATFB) as a supporting electrolyte, at a sweep rate of 100 mV s−1, using the Autolab PGSTAT-30 potentiostat (Ecochemie). A three-electrode, one-compartment electrochemical cell was used, with Metrohm dot (6.0302.000) and planar (6.0305.000) platinum working and counter electrodes, respectively, as well as a Metrohm Ag/AgCl 6.0726.100 reference electrode (LiCl saturated in EtOH). The experiments were performed in deoxygenated solutions purified by N2 gas (99.9%) for 30 min prior to use. During the experiments, N2 was passed over the solution surface.
Electrodes preparation and devices assembly-characterization
Titania films were prepared using the doctor-blade technique by depositing one transparent layer (7–8 μm, measured with an AMBIOS XP-2 profilometer) of a commercial paste (DSL18NR-T, Dyesol) onto a pre-cleaned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass (Pilkington Solar, 3.2 mm thickness). The DSL18NR-T paste solely consists of anatase particles and elongated nanorods with an average size of 17 nm, while its pore size distribution is wide, presenting a maximum at 30 nm. The films were then dried at 125 °C for 6 minutes. A second layer (4.5–5.0 μm) was deposited on top by doctor-blading a paste of large scattering particles (WER2-O, average size of cubic-like particles: 150–250 nm, Dyesol). Next, the films were gradually annealed at 125 °C (5 min), 325 °C (15 min) and then at 525 °C for 30 min. The double layered films were post-treated at 70 °C for 60 min with an aqueous solution of 0.04 M TiCl4, then thoroughly cleaned with water and ethanol and re-annealed at 450 °C for 1 h. The thermally-treated titania films were sensitized by overnight immersion in 0.3 mM dye solutions. The solvents utilized were DMF for DV42, ethanol for DV51, and acetonitrile/tert-butanol for Z907. In the case of Z907 the corresponding solution also contained an equimolar quantity of chenodeoxycholic acid as a co-adsorbent.
In order to evaluate their photovoltaic performance, the dye-sensitized films were incorporated as the active photoelectrode (PE) in a lamellar solar cell configuration of the following structure: conductive glass/TiO2 + dye/electrolyte/Pt/conductive glass. 1.1 mm thick TCO10-10 conductive glasses (Solaronix), platinized by sputtering (resulting in a thickness for the Pt layer of about 100 nm), were used as counter electrodes (CE). Non-sealed DSCs were fabricated by placing a drop of a liquid electrolyte (1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 50 mM LiI, 15 mM I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate dissolved in acetonitrile–valeronitrile (85:15)) onto the photoelectrode and sandwiching the CE on top of the PE.
Current–voltage (I–V) measurements were performed by illuminating the DSCs using solar-simulated light (1 sun AM 1.5 G, 1000 W m−2), from a 300 W Xe lamp. Illumination under 400 nm was excluded using a cut-off UV filter (Oriel). The active area of the DSCs was set at 0.15 cm2, using a black metallic mask of very large area to exclude parasitic light in front of the cell (while the aperture area was larger, 0.36 cm2).9I–V characteristics were obtained using linear sweep voltammetry (scan speed: 50 mV s−1) on an Autolab PGSTAT-30 potentiostat.
Synthesis

Synthesis of 6-bromo-4-phenyl-2-pyridin-2-ylquinoline (1)10. 
In a round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirrer under an argon atmosphere were added 2-amino-5-bromobenzophenone (5.5 g, 20.0 mmol), acetic acid (20 mL), and H2SO4 (98%, 0.1 mL), along with an excess of 2-acetylpyridine (4.5 mL, 40.0 mmol). This reaction mixture was heated at 110 °C under stirring for 48 h. Upon cooling to room temperature, a needle-like solid precipitated from the resulting reaction mixture. This was filtered and washed repeatedly with hot water and methanol. Subsequent drying under vacuum afforded 1 (6.5 g, 90%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz): δ 8.72 (d, 1H), 8.67 (d, 1H), 8.54 (s, 1H), 8.11 (d, 1H), 8.08 (d, 1H), 7.87 (t, 1H), 7.80 (dd, 1H), 7.49–7.56 (m, 5H), 7.36 (t, 1H).


Synthesis of 4-phenyl-2-pyridin-2-yl-6-(4-vinyl-phenyl)-quinoline (3). 
In a degassed three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirrer were added 1 (4.0 g, 11.0 mmol), (4-vinylphenyl)boronic acid (4.5 g, 22.0 mmol), and Pd(PPh3)4 (0.63 g, 0.55 mmol). To this flask were then added degassed toluene (200 mL) and a degassed 2 M aqueous solution of Na2CO3 (50 mL). The mixture was heated under reflux and vigorously stirred for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting mixture was filtered and the organic layer was separated, washed with H2O (3 × 50 mL), and evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained solid was suspended in methanol and filtered to afford a pale white solid. Drying under vacuum resulted in the final product 3 (3.4 g, 80%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz): δ 8.71 (m, 2H), 8.59 (s, 1H), 8.29 (d, 1H), 8.14 (s, 1H), 8.01 (d, 1H), 7.88 (t, 1H), 7.46–7.64 (m, 9H), 7.35 (t, 1H), 6.75 (dd, 1H), 5.81 (d, 1H), 5.27 (d, 1H).


Synthesis of 6-{4-[(E)-2-(9-anthryl)vinyl]phenyl}-4-phenyl-2-pyridin-2-ylquinoline (LP1). 
In a two-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirrer, under an argon atmosphere, were added 3 (1.50 g, 3.90 mmol), an excess of 9-bromoanthracene (1.51 g, 5.87 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (18 mg, 71.3 μmol), and tris(3-methylphenyl)phosphine (72 mg, 235 μmol). DMF (45 mL) along with Et3N (6 mL) were then added and the system was carefully degassed again. The reaction mixture was heated under reflux for 72 h and after cooling to room temperature was poured into a mixture of crushed ice and water (500 mL). A yellowish solid started to form immediately. This mixture was filtered and repeatedly washed with water to remove any excess of solvents. The solid crude product was vigorously stirred for 24 h in ethanol and filtered again. Crude LP1, obtained after drying under reduced pressure at 50 °C for 24 h, was redissolved in the minimum amount of DMF and precipitated with H2O to afford ligand LP1 as a yellow powder (1.31 g, 60%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz): δ 8.88 (s, 1H), 8.80 (d, 1H), 8.65 (s, 1H), 8.50 (s, 1H), 8.41–8.39 (m, 2H), 8.27 (s, 1H), 8.15 (d, 1H), 8.08–8.04 (m, 2H), 8.00–7.98 (m, 2H), 7.81–7.76 (m, 5H), 7.73–7.71 (m, 2H), 7.64–7.58 (m, 3H), 7.54–7.50 (m, 4H), 7.46–7.44 (m, 1H), 7.03 (d, 1H). 13C{1H} NMR (CDCl3, 125 MHz): δ 156.36, 155.65, 149.41, 149.22, 148.05, 140.14, 138.92, 138.38, 136.99, 136.71, 131.54, 130.81, 129.72, 128.88, 128.74, 128.64, 128.46, 127.84, 127.15, 126.59, 125.96, 125.56, 125.33, 125.22, 124.09, 123.48, 121.92, 119.78.

Synthesis of cis-[Ru(LP1)(H2dcbpy)Cl2] (DV42). 
A two-necked 50 mL round-bottomed flask, equipped with a stirring bar and a reflux condenser, was charged with [RuCl(p-cymene)]2 (76.5 mg, 0.125 mmol), LP1 (140.2 mg, 0.250 mmol), and degassed DMF (35 mL) at room temperature under argon. The reaction mixture was heated in the dark at 60 °C for 4 hours. H2dcbpy (61.1 mg, 0.250 mmol) was then added and the reaction mixture was heated in the dark under argon at 140 °C for 4 hours. This solution was cooled to room temperature with a water bath, and DMF was removed on a rotary evaporator. The resulting black solid was taken up and washed on a G4 sintered glass crucible with Et2O (3 × 10 mL), EtOH (6 × 5 mL), and again Et2O (3 × 5 mL). The remaining black powder was dissolved in the minimum amount of DMF, precipitated with Et2O and washed on a G4 sintered glass crucible with Et2O (5 × 10 mL), to afford complex DV42 as a black powder that was dried overnight under high vacuum (178 mg, 73%). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 500 MHz, due to the existence of two diastereoisomeric pairs of enantiomers, each having twenty six diastereotopic protons in the aromatic region, proton signals cannot be fully assigned and integrations are not given): δ 10.42 (d), 10.21 (d), 10.11 (s), 10.10 (s), 10.05 (d), 9.89 (d), 9.47 (d), 9.25–9.11 (m), 9.08 (s), 8.98–8.93 (m), 8.90 (s), 8.72 (s), 8.67 (s), 8.61–8.59 (m), 8.38–8.13 (m), 8.00–7.51 (m), 7.24 (d), 7.19–7.17 (m), 7.08–6.94 (m), 6.78 (d). 13C{1H} NMR (DMSO-d6, 125 MHz): δ 165.83, 165.71, 165.60, 165.34, 165.11, 162.33, 162.16, 161.50, 161.30, 160.61, −159.93, 159.27, 158.76, 158.06, 155.35, 154.56, 154.39, 153.84, 153.58, 153.09, 153.04, 152.10, 147.72, 146.89, 146.79, 137.02, 136.76, 136.22, 135.88, 135.52, 132.11, 132.06, 130.93, 130.34, 129.46, 129.16, 128.92, 128.21, 128.15, 127.96, 127.92, 126.91, 126.69, 126.62, 126.42, 126.13, 125.93, 125.65, 125.11, 124.84, 124.62, 123.74, 123.48, 122.61, 121.25, 120.38.

Synthesis of Na-cis-[Ru(LP1)(Hdcbpy)(NCS)2] (DV51). 
A two-necked 50 mL round-bottomed flask, equipped with a stirring bar and a reflux condenser, was charged with [RuCl(p-cymene)]2 (76.5 mg, 0.125 mmol), LP1 (140.2 mg, 0.250 mmol), and degassed DMF (35 mL) at room temperature under argon. The reaction mixture was heated in the dark at 60 °C for 4 hours. H2dcbpy (61.1 mg, 0.250 mmol) was then added and the reaction mixture was heated in the dark under argon at 140 °C for 4 hours. NH4NCS (475.8 mg, 6.3 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture and heating at 140 °C continued for 4 more hours. This solution was cooled to room temperature with a water bath, and DMF was removed on a rotary evaporator. The resulting black solid was taken up and washed on a G4 sintered glass crucible with H2O (5 × 10 mL), MeOH (10 × 1 mL), and Et2O (5 × 5 mL). The remaining solid was dissolved in the minimum amount of DMF, precipitated with Et2O and washed on a G4 sintered glass crucible with Et2O (5 × 5 mL), to afford complex DV44 as a black powder that was dried overnight under high vacuum (186 mg, 73%). Chromatographed DV51 was obtained from DV44 by the following procedure: 90 mg of DV44 were dissolved in a 0.02 M NaOH solution in MeOH (5 mL) and MeOH (2.5 mL). This solution was filtered, loaded on a Sephadex LH-20 column (equilibrated with MeOH), and purified with MeOH as an eluent. The collected main band (deep red) was concentrated on a rotary evaporator to about 7 mL and slowly titrated with a 0.02 M HNO3 solution in MeOH to pH 5.2 (monitored by a pH meter). The solvent was then removed on a rotary evaporator and the remaining black solid was dissolved in DMF, precipitated with Et2O, and washed on a G4 sintered glass crucible with Et2O (5 × 5 mL), to afford purified DV51.

Results and discussion
Synthesis, NMR, and MS studies of ruthenium dyes
The synthetic approach followed for the preparation of the bidentate pyridine-quinoline hybrid ligand LP1 is presented in Scheme 1. LP1 was synthesized by a Suzuki coupling reaction of 6-bromo-4-phenyl-2-pyridin-2-ylquinoline (1) with (4-vinylphenyl)boronic acid (2), followed by a Heck coupling reaction of the resulting 4-phenyl-2-pyridin-2-yl-6-(4-vinyl-phenyl)-quinoline (3) with 9-bromoanthracene (4). LP1 was obtained in 43% total isolated yield and characterized by 1H, 13C, COSY, and HSQC NMR spectroscopy, as well as with FTIR and Elemental Analysis. Complexes DV42 and DV44, both with cis geometry, were prepared by straightforward experimental procedures (Scheme 2), both in 73% isolated yields. These reactions were monitored by removing small aliquots, which were analyzed via UV-vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Purified and half-deprotonated DV51 (Fig. 2), free of S-coordinated NCS linkage isomers, was obtained from DV44 in 33% isolated yield by Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography. DV42 and DV51 were characterized by 1H, 13C, COSY, and HSQC NMR spectroscopy. Additional characterization was performed including UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and HRMS.

 Scheme 2  Synthesis of Ru(II) photosensitizers DV42 and DV44. 
Due to the unsymmetrical nature of LP1, there are two possible diastereoisomeric pairs of enantiomers for DV42 and DV51 (as well as for DV44). Indeed, the existence of two diastereoisomers for both DV42 and DV51 is clear in their respective NMR spectra. For example, two well-resolved doublets at δ 7.02 and 6.94 ppm, for the major and the minor isomers respectively, were recorded in the 1H NMR spectra of DV51. Integration of these two peaks, which correspond to the vinylic protons next to the phenyl ring of coordinated LP1, suggests a 62/38 ratio for the two diastereoisomeric pairs of DV51. Although the existence of two diastereoisomers for DV42 and DV51 results in fifty two diastereotopic aromatic protons for each, making the complete NMR peak assignment impossible, this does not impose any problem in their function as efficient photosensitizers in DSCs. Equally important, the molecular ions for DV42 and DV44 (the precursor of DV51) were detected by negative mode high resolution ESI at m/z 975.1068 and 1021.1255 respectively (requiring 975.1088 and 1021.1235) indisputably proving the structure of these novel Ru(II) complexes.
UV-visible studies
The UV-vis spectra of the dye solutions (Fig. 4a) show low frequency MLCT transitions (λmax) at 588 nm for DV42 and 552 nm for DV51; this shift is mainly due to the solvatochromic effect. Extinction coefficients (εm) equal to 9438 and 8896 M−1 cm−1 for DV42 and DV51, respectively, were calculated. In comparison to the Z907 dye (Fig. 3), with λmax = 518 nm and εm = 10180 M−1 cm−1, the absorption of the new dyes is slightly lower and shifts well to the red. The UV-vis spectra of the sensitized TiO2 films show a maximum at about 550 nm for both DV42 and DV51. These maxima are red-shifted by 30 nm in relation to the corresponding maximum of the films sensitized with the structurally related Z907 dye (520 nm), which was used as a reference. Even though the thickness of the TiO2 films cannot be precisely controlled, the films sensitized by DV51 present better absorbance than those sensitized by DV42, while both show slightly lower absorbance than Z907-sensitized films. The absorption edges of the sensitized films were found to be 715 and 725 nm, for DV51 and DV42 respectively, by the tangential method (Fig. 4b). Thus, the absorption of both DV42- and DV51-sensitized films extends well into the red spectral range, shifted by 30–40 nm relative to the absorption of the Z907 dye,11 in accordance with our anticipation for a red-shift for DV42 and DV51 due to their extended aromatic conjugation.

Vibrational (infrared, Raman, and resonance Raman) spectroscopy
The infrared spectra of DV42 and DV51 were recorded in the 4000–400 cm−1 region. These spectra are very rich in the fingerprint region (1600–400 cm−1) due to the various atomic vibrations of the two coordinated bidentate ligands LP1 and H2dcbpy. Noteworthily, the presence of a strong absorption band at 2098 cm−1 [v(CN) stretching], along with the absence of such a band at about 2080 cm−1, in the infrared spectra of DV51, confirms solely N-coordination for the ambidentate NCS ligands.7b,12
Resonant Raman spectra of dyes DV42 and DV51 are shown in Fig. 5. The two strong bipyridine modes, ν(CN) and ν(CC), appear at 1475 cm−1 and 1540 cm−1, at the same frequencies observed for the Z907 dye,13 although reversed in intensity. A new ν(CC) mode is observed at 1603 cm−1 and dominates over the 1613 ν(CC) cm−1 one, which is resolved as a satellite peak in the spectra, after the fitting analysis. This last mode is present in Z907 spectra too. Furthermore, characteristic Raman peaks of the quinoline hybrid ligand C–C stretching modes14 at 1358 cm−1 and several C–H modes above 2600 cm−1 from the extended aromatic conjugation unit are observed.
 Fig. 5  Resonant Raman spectra of dyes DV42 and DV51 in the powder form and resonant Raman spectra of dyes DV42, DV51, and Z907 after sensitization of thick TiO2 films. Raman modes discussed in the text are marked in the figure. 
Upon grafting the dyes onto TiO2, the corresponding resonant Raman spectra are enriched with the TiO2 anatase modes at frequencies below 650 cm−1. The strongest mode observed is the E1g at 143 cm−1. The weak Raman peak of the protonated carboxyl group at about 1720 cm−1 is even more reduced in intensity, while in the case of DV51 it vanishes, indicating chemisorption of the dye on the semiconducting surface.7f,g,13 Moreover, weak shifts and changes in the relative intensities of the C–H and C–C modes in the 1250–1320 cm−1 region are observed after fitting analysis, in agreement with literature findings regarding related dyes.7g,13
Contact angle studies
Contact angle measurements provide information on the chemical nature of the sensitized photoelectrode surface and, amongst others, can be used as a preliminary diagnostic method for determining the efficient and optimum duration of TiO2 dye sensitization.11,15 The surface of the non-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes is very hydrophilic and rough. As a result, the corresponding contact angle, measured for 10 μL water droplets on the various films, is very low with θ = 11°. Following sensitization, the films show higher contact angles (Table 1), 55° for the DV51 and 27° for the DV42 films, but remain hydrophilic with values that are commonly observed upon sensitization with the N3 dye.15,16 In this respect, DV51- and DV42-sensitized films differ significantly from the Z907-sensitized TiO2 films, which present strong hydrophobic character exhibiting a measured contact angle of θ = 125°; this contact angle is in agreement with that reported in the literature.11 Therefore, the increased steric bulk of the novel pyridine-quinoline polyaromatic ligand does not result in a significantly enhanced hydrophobicity, as one would anticipate based on the ligand's extended aromatic system.

Electrochemical studies
The cyclic voltammograms of both DV42 and DV51 dyes present quasi-reversible waves with a large peak separation between the anodic (Eap) and cathodic (Ecp) peak potentials (ΔEp = Eap − Ecp ∼ 0.26–0.28 V), attributed to the oxidation of Ru(II) to Ru(III). The first oxidation potentials (Eox) were estimated to be +1.04 and +1.14 V vs. NHE,17,18 lying well below the I−/I3− redox potential (+0.31 V vs. NHE)17 and allowing easy regeneration for both dyes. The 0.1 V difference in the oxidation potential of the two dyes (Table 2) may be attributed to the contribution of the NCS vs. the Cl ligands on the HOMO levels of the respective complexes, as proposed in the literature for several other ruthenium(II)-based dyes.19 Chloride ligands, having an increased electron-donating nature in comparison with thiocyanates,20 promote the easier oxidation of the corresponding ruthenium(II) ion. Both Eox values are analogous to the previously measured Eox values for the benchmark Z907 dye (+1.01 V vs. NHE).21 Given that neither DV42 nor DV51 emit when photoexcited in the visible, their LUMO energy levels could not be estimated from the intersection of the corresponding superimposed UV-vis and emission spectra.7g Alternatively, the dye excited-state oxidation potentials (E*ox)22 were estimated at −0.68 and −0.76 V for DV42 and DV51, respectively, by using the values of the absorption threshold (Eg) determined from the optical spectra. E*ox values of both dyes are more negative than the conduction band edge of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE)23 permitting efficient electron injection from the excited dye molecules into the semiconductor conduction band.

Photovoltaic studies
The photovoltaic performance of the sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes was examined following their incorporation into sandwich-type liquid DSCs. The J–V characteristics were obtained under 1 sun (AM 1.5 G) illumination (Fig. 6) and the corresponding derived electric parameters are summarized in Table 3. The overall power conversion efficiency (η) determined for the DV42 dye-based cells was as high as 3.24%. DV51-based cells showed 4.36% power conversion efficiency accompanied with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 9.30 mA cm−2, an open-circuit potential (Voc) of 0.68 V, and a filling factor (FF) of 0.69. Thus, all photovoltaic parameters are improved in DV51-sensitized cells in comparison with the DV42-sensitized cells.

In view of the fact that electron collection is similar for photoelectrodes consisting of the same TiO2 type, the Jsc increase in the DV51-based cells can be attributed to improved light harvesting in comparison to the DV42-sensitized cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, simple TiO2 films (without any scattering layer) sensitized by the DV51 dye present a higher optical density (A = 0.88 at MLCT) when compared with those sensitized by DV42 (A = 0.83 at the respective MLCT, Fig. 4b). Besides improved light harvesting, the current increase could also be realized because DV51 either enhances electron injection (having an excited-state oxidation potential 80 mV higher than that of the DV42 dye)22 or is regenerated more efficiently by the redox electrolyte. An improved DV51 regeneration could originate from the highly efficient electron transfer from the iodine ions to the NCS ligands, which are known to be excellent electron acceptors,24 despite the fact that the driving force for DV51 is 100 mV smaller than that of DV42 (see the first oxidation potentials in Table 2).
The 0.05 V Voc increase in the DV51-sensitized cells can be attributed to a small shift of the TiO2 conduction band. Given that DV42 leaves two protons on the TiO2 surface upon adsorption, in comparison to one proton for DV51, the semiconductor may be charged more positively in the case of DV42. Suppressed recombination between electrons injected in the semiconductor and triiodides, in the case of DV51-sensitized cells, seems to be an even more possible reason for the improved Voc. This suppressed recombination may originate from the increased hydrophobicity of the DV51-sensitized cells, when compared with their DV42 counterparts. The use of hydrophobic dyes in order to increase Voc is a well-known concept in DSCs literature;25 furthermore, Grätzel and co-workers have observed a 50 mV difference between two dyes that differ about 9° in the contact angles of the respective films.11 In order to more accurately elucidate the observed differences and correlate the photovoltaic performance with the electron dynamics in DV42- vs.DV51-sensitized solar cells, comprehensive studies are currently underway and will be reported in due course.
Finally, comparative experiments performed on identical DSCs sensitized by the widely utilized standard Z907 dye, which attains power conversion efficiencies over 10% in the literature,26 show that the efficiency of the cells obtained from DV51 is about 56% of that attained by Z907 (Table 3). Again, the reduced Jsc and Voc values of DV42- and DV51-sensitized cells in relation with those sensitized by the archetypal Z907 dye (Fig. 6) can be ascribed to the more hydrophobic character of Z907, preventing electrons from recombining with triiodides at the TiO2 surface.
To better understand the DSC performance of DV42 and DV51, the corresponding IPCE (incident photon-to-current efficiency) spectra were recorded (Fig. 7). Slight differences were observed concerning the shape of the action spectra profiles for the Z907 and DV51 dyes, presenting IPCE values over 85% and close to 60% at about 530 nm, respectively. This is in agreement with their Jsc values reported in Table 3. In contrast, DV42-sensitized cells presented a significant red shift of about 30 nm, attaining a maximum IPCE value of 47% at about 560 nm. This shift is not consonant with the absorbance characteristics of DV42 shown in Fig. 4a (note that the transmittance/reflectance of the films was recorded on transparent films); the shift can be attributed to the stronger interaction of the DV42 dye with the scattering TiO2 layer employed in the IPCE measurement. By integrating the product of the incident photon flux density and the IPCE values over the 400 to 800 nm wavelength regime, the calculated short-circuit photocurrents closely match the experimental Jsc values for all cells (within a maximum deviation of 10%).

Conclusions
Two novel, heteroleptic ruthenium(II) sensitizers (DV42 and DV51), bearing an unsymmetrical pyridine-quinoline hybrid ligand with extended π-conjugation, were synthesized, extensively characterized, and utilized in liquid electrolyte dye-sensitized solar cells. The absorption of both DV42- and DV51-sensitized TiO2 films is red-shifted by 30–40 nm relative to the absorption of TiO2 films sensitized with the benchmark Z907 ruthenium(II) dye. This red shift is attributed to the extended aromatic conjugation of DV42 and DV51. Contact angle measurements of DV42- and DV51-sensitized TiO2 films suggest that these films are hydrophilic with contact angle values that are commonly observed upon sensitization with the standard N3 ruthenium(II) dye. The excited-state oxidation potentials of DV42 and DV51 lie well above the TiO2 conduction band, permitting efficient electron injection from the excited dye molecules into the semiconductor conduction band. Moreover, both novel ruthenium(II) dyes have first oxidation potentials that lie below the I−/I3− redox potential allowing easy regeneration. Dye-sensitized solar cells integrating DV42- or DV51-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes afford power conversion efficiencies of 3.24 or 4.36% respectively. These power conversion efficiencies are up to 56% of the corresponding efficiencies attained by TiO2 photoelectrodes sensitized by the standard Z907 ruthenium(II) dye under similar experimental conditions.
