    , Accepted 14th May 2015First published on 28th May 2015AbstractOrganic–inorganic metal halide perovskites have led to remarkable advancements in emerging photovoltaics with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) already achieving 20%. In addition to solar cells, these perovskites also show applicability for lasing and LED applications. Here, we control perovskite crystal domain size and microstructure by guiding the growth through a highly ordered metal oxide honeycomb structure, which we form via colloidal monolayer lithography. The organic–inorganic perovskite material fills the holes of the honeycomb remarkably well leading to fully controlled domain size with tuneable film thickness. The honeycomb region is predominantly transparent, whereas the perovskite crystals within the honeycomb are strongly absorbing. We fabricate semi-transparent perovskite solar cells to demonstrate the feasibility of this structuring, which leads to enhanced open-circuit voltage and fill factor in comparison to unstructured partially dewet perovskite thin films. We achieve power conversion efficiencies of up to 9.5% with an average visible transmittance through the active layer of around 37%. The controlled microscopic morphology of perovskite films opens up a wide range of possible investigations, from charge transport optimization to optical enhancements and photonic structuring for photovoltaic, light emitting and lasing devices.

Broader context
Hybrid perovskite materials have recently disrupted the field of optoelectronic research due to their unique properties that combine low-cost synthesis, simple solution processing and exceptional optical characteristics, which allow applications in highly efficient solar cells, light emitting diodes and lasers. The crystallization is not yet fully understood and leads to different thin-film morphologies that are difficult to control. While many applications require continuous films with minimized pinholes and defects, some applications benefit from controlled distinct perovskite domains in the micrometer range to induce special optical effects. Therefore a templating technique was developed to use patterned oxide structures that confine the solution processed perovskite domains with controllable size and thickness. We demonstrate the application of this technique within an enhanced semi-transparent perovskite solar cell and provide a pathway to attractive building integrated photovoltaics and other micro-structured perovskite technologies.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic perovskite materials have attracted increasing attention over the past two to three years leading to high performance solar cells with recorded power conversion efficiencies exceeding 20%,1–6 as well as demonstration in other optoelectronic applications, such as thin-film transistors, lasers and light emitting diodes.7–10 For many optoelectronic applications, the introduction of periodic structures on the photonic length scale can be important to control the interaction between light and matter. For instance, lasers require optical feedback11–13 and LEDs require control over the angular emission of light.14–16 Specifically for perovskite solar cells, in addition to achieve high performance, another important application of controlling the optical properties of the active layer is the fabrication of semi-transparent solar cells for building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).17 Previously, we have reduced the surface coverage of the absorbing perovskite layer, by forming randomly distributed islands of perovskite upon the planar n-type charge collection electrode in a perovskite solar cell. The average visible transparency of the fabricated films can be controlled from close to 0 to 80% with neutral colour and reasonably high photovoltaic performance still being preserved.18 However, the presence of regions in the solar cell where the p-type and n-type charge collection materials make contact, in between the perovskite islands, leads to the formation of a “shunt diode”, lowering the open-circuit voltage. In addition, the non-uniform shape of the perovskite islands leads to scattering of light, which is non-ideal.
Previously, long before the perovskite solar cell research pandemic, Kagan et al.19 demonstrated that layered organic–inorganic perovskite films can be structured on the 3–10's of micrometer length scale via imprinting a substrate with a self-assembled monolayer of functional groups, which induce a strong contrast in the surface energy between patterned and non-patterned regions. Subsequent coating of the surface energy patterned films with the layered perovskite (C6H5C2H4NH3)2SnI4 led to structuring of the perovskite, where the material was absent from the hydrophobic regions. The 3D crystalline CH3NH3PbX3 perovskite (where X is one or more halides), which show good PV performance and high luminescence efficiency, have a very strong tendency to crystallize into large domains, often on the 10's of microns length scale.20 For the surface energy patterning to be successful on a length scale shorter than the natural crystalline domain size, the surface interaction must be very strong, and dominate over the inherent tendency to form large unbound domains. Thus far, we have found surface energy patterning challenging to replicate structures at the photonic length scale into the optoelectronically relevant perovskite materials. There is therefore a pressing need for a new approach to structure these perovskite materials with periodic length scales close to the wavelength of light.
Colloidal monolayer lithography (CML) represents an efficient and low-cost technique for the fabrication of large area, highly ordered, structured arrays. Through the self-assembly of different size of polymer microspheres, monolayers can have feature sizes ranging from tens of nanometres to several micrometers.21 Densely packed monolayers of microspheres can be produced by drop-casting,22 dip-coating,23 spin-coating,24 electrophoretic deposition25 or water interface transfer of the monolayer onto a substrate.26 To date, this has been successfully applied in a plethora of fields where precise domain size control is required, including bio-sensing via surface enhanced Raman scattering,27 photonic crystals,28,29 or surface plasmon applications.30 On the other hand, incorporating insulating oxides, such as SiO2, has been proven to work well in perovskite solar cells31 and as insulating buffer layers in solid state dye sensitized solar cells.32,33
Herein we employ a double templating approach to introduce periodic structure into perovskite thin films. We use a colloidal monolayer of polystyrene (PS) microspheres as a sacrificial template to fabricate micro-structured SiO2 honeycomb films. With subsequent coating and infiltration of the SiO2 honeycomb with a perovskite precursor solution, we achieve precisely controlled perovskite domains. As an example of their use, we incorporate these patterned perovskite films into semi-transparent perovskite solar cells, which exhibit high levels of transparency and reasonably high efficiencies due to increased fill factors and open circuit voltages as compared to semi-transparent perovskite solar cells fabricated from disordered perovskite islands.
Results and discussion
We show a schematic illustration of the fabrication method for patterning the oxide structures in Fig. 1a. We uniformly deposit colloidal PS monolayers onto the FTO/compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) coated substrate via spin-coating (step 1 and 2), and then subsequently fill the gaps of the hexagonal closely packed PS microspheres with either a TiO2 precursor solution or a SiO2 nanoparticle solution (step 3). We finally sinter the films at 500 °C to remove the polymer template, leaving behind the inverse porous honeycomb structure (step 4). Fabrication of PS monolayers has been previously reported on smooth surfaces such as glass (root mean square roughness ∼2 nm), and silicon wafers (root mean square roughness <0.5 nm).34 We managed to get a uniform distribution of microspheres on the FTO/c-TiO2 surface (Fig. 1b) with a measured root mean square roughness of 5.2 nm (Fig. S1, ESI†). We employed two different oxides to fabricate the scaffold: TiO2 shows a tubular-like honeycomb structure after curing (Fig. 1c and AFM image in Fig. S2, ESI†) and SiO2 yields a more contiguous honeycomb structure (Fig. 1d). A broad range of other oxides should also be able to be template following this methodology, provided that the precursor solvent does not dissolve or wash away the PS spheres from the substrate during the spin-coating process.35 We optimized the curing process via different heating steps leading to honeycomb structures with open pores at the top and bottom. We included a soft baking step of the as deposited polystyrene spheres at 80 °C for 2 h to dry the films and begin to melt the microspheres to increase the contact area with the c-TiO2 layer before forming the scaffold. Subsequently a quick increase to 250 °C to rapidly degrade the microspheres and a slow rise to 500 °C to form a stable oxide structure. We note that the 80 °C step is important to resultantly expose compact TiO2 at the base of the holes in the as formed SiO2 honeycomb. We used PS microspheres with diameters of 0.37 (Fig. 1e and f), 0.6 (Fig. 1g and h) and 1 μm (Fig. 1b–d) to fabricate scaffolds with different pore sizes.

SEM images of colloidal monolayer (e, g) of PS microspheres with 0.37 and 0.6 μm diameter and corresponding SiO2 honeycomb scaffold (f, h). 
In order to template the perovskite material, we fill the pores of the honeycomb structures with CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite by spin-coating the precursor solution and annealing in a nitrogen filled glovebox. After annealing, the perovskite films show uniformity over a wide area on the TiO2 and SiO2 scaffolds (Fig. 2a and b). We control the perovskite film thickness within the pores by diluting the precursor solution. As a control, using the same concentration of precursor solution, we fabricated perovskite films on planar FTO/c-TiO2 substrates (no scaffold, Fig. 2c) and mesoporous SiO2 film (400 nm thick, Fig. 2d). While the film formation on the patterned honeycomb structures appears to be completely uniform, the films on top of FTO/c-TiO2 as well as on a mesoporous SiO2 scaffold show random formations of perovskite domains as has been previously observed.18,20,36 Since the honeycomb pores are significantly smaller than the randomly forming domains in unstructured substrates (Fig. 2c), the perovskite growth is bounded by the honeycomb walls. This leads to good filling behaviour within the pores and therefore the presented micro-structured oxide scaffold provides controllable perovskite domain size, despite the extremely strong tendency of the material to crystalize.36 The crystal structure itself does not show a significant change, as we show in Fig. S3 (ESI†), though we note that the diffraction peak widths are broader for the perovskite processed on the honeycomb structure. This indicates that the crystal domain size is smaller, consistent with confinement of the crystallisation within the honeycomb.
 Fig. 2  SEM images (top view) showing perovskite film formations within TiO2 (a) and SiO2 (b) honeycomb scaffolds, on a c-TiO2 layer (c) and on a mesoporous SiO2 scaffold of 400 nm thickness (d) produced with 20 wt% perovskite precursor solution. Detailed top view and cross-section SEM images show the filling characteristic of TiO2 scaffold with 20 wt% (e, f) and 40 wt% (g, h) perovskite precursor solution. 
In addition to varying the pore size of the honeycomb structure, we can also tune the height of honeycomb walls by changing the PS microsphere size and the concentration of TiO2 precursor or SiO2 nanoparticle solution. For example in this study the honeycomb structure, which we fabricated from 1 μm PS microspheres, yields 400 nm in wall height. Moreover, by varying the concentration of the perovskite precursor solution, we can control the thickness of the in-filled perovskite domains. In Fig. 2e–h we show the filling of TiO2 scaffold pores walls with 20 and 40 wt% perovskite concentrations, respectively. At lower concentration the perovskite forms only within the pores (Fig. 2e and f) while at higher concentration an additional capping layer is formed on top of the metal oxide scaffold (Fig. 2g and h). We fabricate the SiO2 honeycombs from a SiO2 nanoparticle-solution, which forms cup-like shapes of mesoporous SiO2. These SiO2 structures appear to predominantly coat the entire substrate at the base of the “cups” and may therefore require interpenetration by the perovskite in order for the electronic charge to be conducted through the perovskite to the compact TiO2.
In Fig. 3a we show a comparison of the total transmission spectra of the control substrate (FTO/TiO2 compact layer) and substrates with additional TiO2 (FTO/TiO2 compact layer/TiO2 honeycomb) or SiO2 (FTO/TiO2 compact layer/SiO2 honeycomb) honeycomb structures. While the TiO2 honeycomb film appears to reduce the specular transmission in the visible range, the SiO2 honeycomb shows a considerably different characteristic, since it transmits even more light than the TiO2 compact layer substrate. We expect the improved transmittance to be caused by reduced reflectivity that results from a decreased refractive index contrast at the compact TiO2/air interface due to the insertion of the porous SiO2 “interlayer” (nair = 1.0, nSiO2 = 1.5, nTiO2 = 2.637,38), leading to an anti-reflective character.39
 Fig. 3  Total transmission measurements (a) within the visible spectrum of FTO/c-TiO2 substrates (solid red line), compared to FTO/c-TiO2 substrates covered with the SiO2 honeycomb scaffold (dashed green line) and TiO2 honeycomb scaffold (dotted blue line). Total transmission measurements (b) within the visible spectrum of top-electrode less devices with (dashed lines) and without SiO2 honeycomb scaffolds (solid lines) and absorbing layers fabricated with 10 (blue lines), 15 (magenta lines) and 20 wt% (green lines) perovskite solutions. 
As an example application of patterned perovskite thin films, we proceeded to develop semi-transparent perovskite solar cells and focused on the SiO2 honeycomb structures since we showed them to be more transmissive in the visible spectrum than the TiO2 honeycomb structure (Fig. 3a). We compare the optical properties of these films coated with CH3NH3PbI3−xClx directly to dewet perovskite films with the absence of any scaffold in Fig. 3. The transmission through the honeycomb-structured films is similar to that through the dewet perovskite films, but there is a slight flattening of the overall spectra, consistent with some panchromatic light passing un-attenuated through the SiO2 regions. We note that the honeycomb-structured SiO2 regions are likely to be mesoporous and hence also contain a certain fraction of perovskite. This explains why we have not yet achieved entirely neutral transmission with this structure. Despite the lack of neutral transmission, the average visible transmittance (AVT) of around 47% is reached for the low perovskite concentration (10 wt%), followed by around 37% and 28% for medium (15 wt%) and high (20 wt%) perovskite concentrations for the honeycomb structured films. We fabricated devices exceeding efficiencies of 12% with thicker, less transparent films made from 30 wt% perovskite solution (shown in Fig. S4, ESI†). We note that we usually employ 40 wt% solution for fully optimized planar heterojunction or meso-superstructured devices, so all the concentrations for semi-transparent solar cells fabricated in the present work are lower than those required for maximum performance in solar cells.
We fabricated solar cell devices by capping the micro-structured perovskite layers with an organic hole-conductor 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), and a top electrode (Ag), as we show schematically in Fig. 4a. In Fig. 4b we show a colour-enhanced cross-section SEM image of a complete device fabricated from the micro-structured SiO2 honeycomb and 20 wt% perovskite precursor solution. We compared devices with and without the honeycomb scaffold at identical perovskite concentrations and measured the device performance under simulated AM 1.5 100 mW cm−2 sunlight (see J–V characteristic curves in Fig. 4c). We observe an increase in both open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) for the devices employing micro-structured SiO2 honeycomb as scaffold. The enhanced Voc and FF can be explained by the suppression of recombination, or “shunting” paths between the hole-blocking layer (c-TiO2) and the hole-transporting layer (spiro-OMeTAD) by the non-conductive SiO2 oxide. We show the shunt resistance (RSH) and series resistance (RS) for devices in Fig. 4c which we determined by fitting the J–V curves with a one-diode model after Unger et al.40 We calculated the values for the 20 wt% samples as RSH = 4.1 × 109 Ohm, RS = 65.4 Ohm for the honeycomb structured device and RSH = 1.8 × 104 Ohm, RS = 138.7 Ohm for the dewet device. We found a similar trend for the 10 wt% devices (RSH = 1.7 × 109 Ohm, RS = 43.7 Ohm for SiO2 HC and RSH = 1.6 × 109 Ohm, RS = 246.2 Ohm for the dewet device). The higher shunting resistance supports the argument that recombination paths are significantly blocked in the honeycomb-structured devices.

Perovskite (purple) is shown in cup-shape SiO2 scaffold pores (green) and covered with hole transporting layer, spiro-OMeTAD (yellow), below a silver top-electrode (white). Measured (symbols) and one-diode model fitted (lines) J–V characteristics of devices fabricated with and without SiO2 honeycomb scaffolds and covered with perovskite films processed from 10 and 20 wt% precursor solutions (c). The arrows indicate the obvious change of shape that results in higher open-circuit voltages and fill factors for the SiO2 honeycomb scaffold devices. The current voltage curves were scanned from forward bias to short-circuit at a rate of 0.15 V s−1. 
We note that the average short-circuit current densities (JSC) are slightly lower for devices with honeycomb scaffolds, as compared to dewet perovskite film devices, which we attribute to the fact that some perovskite domains might not be in full contact with the electron-transporting layer. However, we assume that the few separating SiO2 regions are partially infiltrated by perovskite and therefore allow for slightly reduced charge transport. This effect is consistent with our previous observation showing lower photocurrents for perovskites infiltrating meso-structured scaffolds,41 presumably due to the electron–hole lifetime being shorter when the material infiltrates the mesoporous oxides.42 This trend is slightly suppressed at higher perovskite concentration (20 wt%), since the majority of the perovskite film will be formed from larger crystalline domains for both the dewet perovskite films and honeycomb structured films. In Table 1 we summarize the solar cell performance parameters. Perovskite solar cells employing micro-structured SiO2 honeycombs exhibit high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) while maintaining high optical transparency. PCE of 4.5% can be reached at 47% AVT (excluding the absorption in the silver electrode) with perovskite precursor concentration of 10 wt%. Higher concentrated perovskite (20 wt%) leads to a PCE of 9.5% at 28% AVT. Following the method described by Eperon et al.18 we calculated the AVT of the photoactive layer (SiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD) to be 63 and 37%, respectively, for the lower and higher concentrated micro-structured perovskite films. We note that all the current voltage curves presented here are scanned from forward bias to short-circuit. There is a certain degree of hysteresis in the J–V curves and the stabilized power output at the maximum power voltage is lower than that determined from the current voltage curves.43 For instance in Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†) we show the forward current voltage scans for a typical device, which exhibited a J–V derived PCE of 7.5% with a stabilized PCE of just over 5%.

Experimental
The glass substrates have been purchased from Pilkington Inc. with a coated FTO layer of 15 Ohm square−1. FTO was partially removed from the substrate via etching with zinc powder and 2 M HCl then cleaned sequentially with Hellmanex detergent, DI-water, acetone and ethanol. A 10 min O2 plasma etching was applied before the TiO2 compact layer was deposited by spin-coating a solution of 0.71 g titanium isopropoxide and 0.07 g HCl in 8 mL of ethanol. Then it was sintered on a hot plate up to 500 °C for 30 min.
The fabrication of a closely packed monolayer of polystyrene microspheres followed the modified spin-coating procedure after Hulteen et al.34 and Cheung et al.44 The diameters of employed microspheres varied between 0.37 to 1 μm and were ordered from Fischer-Scientific (10 wt%). The particle solution was mixed in a 10:1 (v/v) dilution with a 1:400 (v/v) solution of Triton X-100 in methanol. The resulting solution was dispersed for 10 minutes in a sonication bath and then filtered with a 2.7 μm filter. The multi-step spin-coating involved a first step of 300 rpm for 10 seconds, a second step at 600 rpm for two minutes and an additional step of 2000 rpm for 10 seconds. The self-assembled polystyrene monolayer was dried at room temperature in air for about 3 hours. The oxide honeycomb is fabricated by spin-coating a solution of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol (the same as previously used for the compact layer) or a solution of 20 nm pre-made SiO2 particles in ethanol45 onto the polystyrene monolayer. Subsequently the monolayer was sintered in multiple steps (drying at 80 °C for 2 hours, quick heating to 250 °C for PS degradation, holding for 30 minutes, then increase within 2 hours to 500 °C and sinter for 30 minutes) to form a stable oxide honeycomb structure.
Filling the honeycombs with perovskite was realized via spin coating different concentrations (10%, 15% and 20% in dimethylformamide) of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx2 onto the patterned substrates. This was carried out in a N2 filled glove box at spin speed of 2000 rpm for 60 seconds. The perovskite layer was then annealed for 1.5 hours at 100 °C.
For the fabrication of solar cell devices the hole-transporting layer was deposited on top of the perovskite films by spin-coating a solution with 10 wt% 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) in chlorobenzene and 30 mol% lithium bis(trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)imide and 80 mol% 4-tert-butylpyridine as additives, at 2000 rpm for 60 seconds in the N2 atmosphere. The sample was dried overnight in a light-sealed desiccator. A 120 nm Ag layer was finally evaporated on top of spiro-OMeTAD as the top-electrode.
For measuring the performance of the solar cells, simulated AM 1.5 sunlight was generated with a class AAB ABET solar simulator. It was calibrated to give simulated AM 1.5, of 100 mW cm−2 equivalent irradiance, using an NREL-calibrated KG5 filtered silicon reference cell. The mismatch factor was calculated to be 1.065 between 300–900 nm, which is beyond the operating range of both the KG5 filtered silicon reference cell and the perovskite test cells.46 The current–voltage curves were recorded with a sourcemeter (Keithley 2400, USA). The solar cells were masked with a metal aperture defining the active area (0.0625 cm2) of the solar cells.
The transmission measurements were carried out with an internally coupled integrated sphere in a Varian Cary 300 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Structural characterization was carried out with a Hitachi S-4300 field emission scanning electron microscope and film thickness was measured using a Veeco Dektak 150 surface profilometer.
Conclusions
In summary, we have presented a scalable technique for fabricating highly ordered patterned metal oxide scaffolds that can be used to pattern perovskite thin films on a photonic length scale, despite the tendency for the material to crystalize in much larger domains when unbound. We have applied these films to semi-transparent perovskite solar cells, which exhibit very respectable measured efficiencies of over 9% with relatively high photoactive layer average visible transmission of 37%. With respect to the semi-transparent solar cells, the key attribute of the honeycomb scaffold is that the electronic contact between the compact TiO2 and the hole-conductor is suppressed, which otherwise results in a low shunt resistance in the solar cell. For enhancing the use of semi-transparent solar cells, further work should be focused upon more effective segregation of the perovskite from the scaffold region, achieving steeper template walls and focusing on reducing the light scattering by tuning of the template pore size and uniformity. Beyond semi-transparent solar cells, this sort of optical structure may be able to be modified to enhance the overall light absorption and emission from perovskite thin films. Not limited to photovoltaics, this work opens the door for many future applications that involve the controllable patterning of perovskite films for photonics and optoelectronics, relevant to LEDs and lasers.

Broader context
Hybrid perovskite materials have recently disrupted the field of optoelectronic research due to their unique properties that combine low-cost synthesis, simple solution processing and exceptional optical characteristics, which allow applications in highly efficient solar cells, light emitting diodes and lasers. The crystallization is not yet fully understood and leads to different thin-film morphologies that are difficult to control. While many applications require continuous films with minimized pinholes and defects, some applications benefit from controlled distinct perovskite domains in the micrometer range to induce special optical effects. Therefore a templating technique was developed to use patterned oxide structures that confine the solution processed perovskite domains with controllable size and thickness. We demonstrate the application of this technique within an enhanced semi-transparent perovskite solar cell and provide a pathway to attractive building integrated photovoltaics and other micro-structured perovskite technologies.


 	Fig. 1  Fabrication steps for patterned oxide scaffolds (a): an aqueous solution of PS microspheres is spin-coated onto the FTO/c-TiO2 (1), the microspheres assemble in a hexagonal-close-packed monolayer (2), spin-coating the oxide precursor solution fills the gaps of the monolayer (3), porous honeycomb structure forms after sintering procedure (4). SEM images (with magnified insets, scale bar 1 μm) showing a typical highly ordered monolayer of 1 μm diameter PS microspheres (b), cured TiO2 (c) and SiO2 (d) honeycomb structure. SEM images of colloidal monolayer (e, g) of PS microspheres with 0.37 and 0.6 μm diameter and corresponding SiO2 honeycomb scaffold (f, h).	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM images (top view) showing perovskite film formations within TiO2 (a) and SiO2 (b) honeycomb scaffolds, on a c-TiO2 layer (c) and on a mesoporous SiO2 scaffold of 400 nm thickness (d) produced with 20 wt% perovskite precursor solution. Detailed top view and cross-section SEM images show the filling characteristic of TiO2 scaffold with 20 wt% (e, f) and 40 wt% (g, h) perovskite precursor solution.	 

 	Fig. 3  Total transmission measurements (a) within the visible spectrum of FTO/c-TiO2 substrates (solid red line), compared to FTO/c-TiO2 substrates covered with the SiO2 honeycomb scaffold (dashed green line) and TiO2 honeycomb scaffold (dotted blue line). Total transmission measurements (b) within the visible spectrum of top-electrode less devices with (dashed lines) and without SiO2 honeycomb scaffolds (solid lines) and absorbing layers fabricated with 10 (blue lines), 15 (magenta lines) and 20 wt% (green lines) perovskite solutions.	 

 	Fig. 4  Schematic illustration of the device architecture with oxide honeycomb scaffold (a). Colour enhanced cross-section SEM image of a complete device fabricated from the micro-structured SiO2 honeycomb with 20 wt% perovskite precursor solution (b). Perovskite (purple) is shown in cup-shape SiO2 scaffold pores (green) and covered with hole transporting layer, spiro-OMeTAD (yellow), below a silver top-electrode (white). Measured (symbols) and one-diode model fitted (lines) J–V characteristics of devices fabricated with and without SiO2 honeycomb scaffolds and covered with perovskite films processed from 10 and 20 wt% precursor solutions (c). The arrows indicate the obvious change of shape that results in higher open-circuit voltages and fill factors for the SiO2 honeycomb scaffold devices. The current voltage curves were scanned from forward bias to short-circuit at a rate of 0.15 V s−1.
