Introduction
Two dimensional (2D) materials play a crucial role in the world of nanomaterials since graphene was first synthesized in 2004.1–3 Graphene is an atomically carbon monolayer with strong sp2 hybridized orbitals. It is a semi-metal with Dirac cones formed at the Fermi level with linear band dispersion near the six corners of the two-dimensional hexagonal Brillouin zone.4 The linear band dispersion leads to zero effective mass and high carrier mobility. Intractably, the lack of a finite energy gap indicates that the current can not be turned off completely, which is a formidable hurdle to the use of graphene in high speed switching devices, photocatalytic reactions or other applications. Nevertheless, graphene indeed leads the trend of 2D materials, following which, many 2D materials have been synthesized and even more have been predicted,8–10 examples including silicene, germanene, BN, MX2 (M = V, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W; X = S, Se, and Te), MXene, and g-C3N4 as well as their derivatives.11–13 These 2D nanomaterials draw considerable attention due to their novel electronic, mechanical, magnetic and photocatalytic behaviors exceeding those of graphene.14 Among them, Si-based 2D monolayers are more desirable. Main reasons are as follows: (1) fundamentally, Si is the second most abundant element only to oxygen in the crust. (2) Secondly, Si-based materials are always hard, stable, nontoxic and compatible. (3) More practically, most electronic devices are made of Si-based materials. It is no exaggeration that we are experiencing a “Si revolution”.15–17
Hitherto researchers are still endeavoring to develop Si-based materials both experimentally and theoretically. Among them, silicon carbide nanomaterials with high stability and excellent elastic properties were investigated by Zhou et al. systematically.18,19 Recently, a room temperature silicene field-effect transistor (FET) with high charge transport and strong compatibility was reported and highlighted.20 Moreover, new silicon allotropes were predicted to have higher conversion efficiency from solar energy to electric power and better optical properties than traditional Si-based materials.21 Meanwhile, other Si-based monolayers and their allotropes were also investigated due to their promising applications in nanoelectronics and photovoltaics.22,23 Another fact worthy of attention is that 2D materials are most likely to be constructed by even-number rings, such as tetragons, hexagons, octagons or odd-even mixtures,24–27 while thermally stable 2D monolayers that consist of pure odd-number rings are extremely scarce. Intriguingly, inspired by the pure pentagon-based C20 cage, Wang et al. declared that penta-graphene could exist in a dynamically and mechanically stable form.28 The all-pentagon carbon monolayer breaks the rule of traditional 2D monolayer allotropes generally consisting of even-number rings and may be experimentally exfoliated from the T12-carbon phase.29 Considering that Si is another most versatile element in the periodic table besides C and forms tremendous allotropes in different forms, thus, we wonder whether Si-based 2D materials such as Si and SiX (X = B, C, N) allotrope monolayers could be formed by all pentagons? If the answer is yes: the dynamical and thermal stabilities, the intrinsic electronic properties as well as the potential applications of Si-based pentagonal monolayers are worth to be systematically investigated. Further exploration surprisingly shows that Si-based pentagons are experimentally proved to exist in okayamalite Ca2SiB2O7 by means of Rietveld refinement, as shown in Fig. 1a.30 It is revealed that okayamalite exhibits a melilite-type structure with the space group P21m. The key results give direct structural evidence that Si and B are ordered distributing on the T1 and T2 sites, respectively. It is also worth to mention that researchers have developed new synthetic routes to layered porous materials by taking advantage of solid weaknesses, which can lead to new configurations that break the rules of current feasibility.31 To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies reported on 2D Si and SiX allotropes composed of all pentagons. Thus these fundamental studies are highly desired to forecast novel properties and develop potential applications. In addition, enlightened by g-C3N4, which is proved to be a metal-free polymeric photocatalyst for hydrogen production from water under visible light, researchers are endeavoring to find more metal-free nanomaterials with sufficient efficiency, stable structure, flexible manufacturing and the capability of harvesting light. Considering that finding proper photocatalysts for water splitting by using solar energy is one of the glorious missions of material science, we expect to give powerful physical insights for Si-based pentagonal monolayers as photocatalyst in visible light water splitting.

In this work, by using first principles calculations, we systematically study the stability and electronic properties of all pentagon-based Si (p-Si) and SiX (p-SiX, X = B, C, and N) monolayers. Phonon spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations provide compelling evidence for thermal and dynamical stabilities of p-SiX monolayers. Remarkably, we find that p-SiC and p-SiN are in-direct and quasi-direct semiconductors with band gaps of 2.35 and 4.98 eV by HSE functional, respectively. High carrier mobilities of p-SiC up to 2500 cm2 V−1 s−1 can be comparable with many other 2D materials, which can make p-SiC a good candidate for FET or other electronic devices. Furthermore, inspired by g-C3N4 nanomaterials, the applications in photocatalytic water splitting of p-SiC are demonstrated indicating that p-SiC could be another potential metal-free photocatalyst which fulfills the energetic requirements in reduction and oxidation processes for water splitting. We demonstrate that the stable p-SiX monolayers exhibit interesting mechanical and electronic properties and could be potential candidates in many areas such as FET and photocatalytic water splitting.
Computational methods
First principles calculations were performed by using density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). The electron exchange-correlation functional was treated by using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) parametrization.32,33 The atoms positions and lattice parameters are fully optimized until the force on each atom is less than 0.02 eV Å−1. The 2D system is separated from its periodic images by a vacuum slab of 15 Å. The 2D Brillouin zone was sampled by 9 × 9 × 1 K-points within the Monkhorst–Pack scheme for structural optimization and by 11 × 11 × 1 K-points for electronic structural calculations.34 The energy cutoff, convergence in energy, and force are set to 450 eV and 10−5 eV, respectively. In addition, considering that the PBE functional underestimates the band gaps of semiconductors,35 band structures of four monolayers are also examined by the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional for better description.36 Besides, AIMD simulations are carried out to examine thermal stability by using 3 × 3 supercells at 300 K and 600 K within each time step of 3 fs.
Results and discussion
Geometric structures of p-Si and p-SiX monolayers
Similar to the geometrical structure of penta-graphene, the pentagon Si-based monolayer structure is shown in Fig. 1b. p-Si possesses a P21m symmetry with a 2D tetragonal lattice, which is analogical to the symmetry in penta-graphene.28 As for p-Si, the optimized lattice parameters are a = b = 5.59 Å. The length of each Si–Si bond in the ground state p-Si monolayer is 2.36 Å, which is similar to the Si–Si bond in the silicene monolayer.10 In one primitive cell of p-Si, there are six Si atoms. It can be seen distinctly that Si atoms have two nonequivalent crystallographic sites. For one type Si atom represented by Si1, the number of nearest-neighbor atoms around Si1 (labeled as green ball in Fig. 1c) is three. While for another type Si atom represented by Si2 (labeled as purple ball in Fig. 1c), the number of adjacent atoms around which is four. There are six Si atoms in each primitive cell: four Si1 atoms distribute inside the unit cell, while two Si2 atoms locate in the middle and at the corner of the primitive cell, respectively. Based on the two types of Si atoms, an artful pattern entirely composed of Si pentagons, commonly known as Cairo pentagonal tilling37 is clearly shown from the top view in Fig. 1b. From the side view, it is obscure that a layered structure like a sandwich with the thickness of 1.32 Å is formed. Based on the ingenious design of the p-Si monolayer, p-SiX (X = B, C, and N) composed of all pentagons is proposed by substituting Si1 in p-Si with X (X = B, C, or N), as shown in Fig. 1b. There are two Si atoms and four X atoms in the primitive cell of p-SiX. As for p-SiC, the bond length of Si–C is 1.91 Å, while the bond length of C–C is 1.36 Å indicating a pronounced character of the double bond.
Energetic, dynamic and thermal stabilities
After ingenious building of various Si-based pentagonal monolayers, the emphasis is to confirm their dynamical and thermal stabilities. The lattice dynamics are studied by calculating phonon dispersion curves, as shown in Fig. 2a. For the p-Si monolayer, apparent imaginary frequencies are spread all over the Brillouin zone, indicating the dynamical instability of p-Si. The optimized structure of the p-SiC monolayer is stable with well separated positive optical and acoustical frequencies. Two acoustical branches are with linear dispersions near the Γ point, whereas the lowest transverse branch displays a quadratic dispersion near the Γ point. As for p-SiB and p-SiN monolayers, the lowest transverse branch has quite a few imaginary frequencies as K → 0. It may be interpreted that p-SiB and p-SiN monolayers could also be stable if the wavelength of this particular mode is relatively smaller.38 To further check the thermal stability of dynamically stable p-SiX monolayers, AIMD simulations are performed. The snapshots of structures calculated by AIMD are shown in Fig. 2b. After running 1000 steps at the temperature of 300 K and 600 K, no broken bonds and structure reconstructions are found in all cases, suggesting that the structures of p-SiX monolayers are stable even at a temperature of 600 K. Our present analysis about phonon dispersion curves together with AIMD simulations provides a stringent and eloquent examination of the dynamical and thermal stabilities of Si-based pentagonal monolayers, respectively. The evolution of free energy for p-SiC during AIMD simulation at 300 K is shown in Fig. 2c, which further proves that at the temperature of 300 K the p-SiC monolayer is thermodynamically stable.

Electronic properties of p-SiX monolayers
It is proved that fully optimized p-SiX (X = B, C, N) monolayers are dynamically and thermally stable. Next, we put emphasis on the electronic properties of above three p-SiX monolayers. The energy band structures and the density of states of p-SiX monolayers are plotted in Fig. 3. p-SiC is an indirect semiconductor with a band gap of 1.39 eV by PBE functional. Herein, the valence band maximum (VBM) is located at the K point, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) lies on the K → Γ path. There are two degenerate states with different dispersions at the VBM. p-SiB is metallic with the Fermi level buried into the VBM. p-SiN is an indirect semiconductor with an energy gap of 3.59 eV by PBE functional, because the VBM is located on the K → Γ path, while the CBM lies on the Γ → M path. However, the sub-CBM on the K → Γ path exists in the p-SiN monolayer, which is pretty close to the CBM with an energy difference less than 0.1 eV. Thus, p-SiN can be treated as a quasi-direct semiconductor with a wide band-gap. Considering that the PBE functional may underestimate the band gaps of semiconductors and sometimes misjudge the dispersion of energy structures, we also used the HSE hybrid functional to ensure the calculation reliability for p-SiC and p-SiN monolayers. After the correction by using the HSE hybrid functional, the band gaps of p-SiC and p-SiN are 2.35 and 4.98 eV, respectively. Analysis of the partial DOS of p-SiC reveals that the electronic states near the Fermi level mainly originate from C-2p and Si-3p states, and the C-2p state contributes more conspicuously than Si-3p. Fig. 3d presents the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied electronic states in p-SiC. It is worth while to note that the electronic properties of the p-SiC monolayer are rather similar to those of the recent famous g-C3N4 monolayer. Both of them are indirect semiconductors with band gaps within the range of 2.30 to 2.90 eV. As known to all, g-C3N4 is a promising metal-free photocatalyst which has been proved both theoretically and experimentally.39 Accordingly, a question arises about whether p-SiX monolayers have promising effectiveness in photocatalytic reactions or other related applications.

Small effective mass and high carrier mobility of p-SiC
In the view of potential applications of p-SiX monolayers in nanoelectronics or as photocatalysts, high charge mobility and effective electron–hole separation are essential aspects. The carrier effective mass can give a quantitative description of the ability to transfer electrons–holes along specific directions. The effective masses of electrons (m*e) and holes (m*h) are studied by fitting parabolic functions to the VBM and CBM of p-SiC, according to the following equation: (1)where k is the wave vector, and Ek is the energy corresponding to the wave vector k. We present the m*e and m*h of VBM and CBM along specific directions listed in Table 1. Herein the reciprocal point corresponding to CBM of p-SiC is labeled as X for simplicity. The region chosen for parabolic fitting is within an energy difference of 60 meV. On the basis of analysis of effective masses, it can be predicted that the effective masses of p-SiC are in general smaller than other 2D materials40,41 and common photocatalytic materials.42,43 In the photocatalytic process, the transfer of carriers to the reactive sites is more easier with smaller effective masses. It is found that m*e is equivalent along two adjacent special reciprocal points near the CBM. As for m*h at the VBM, there are two fold degenerate states: the heavier holes correspond to the less dispersive band C1, while the lighter holes are related to the more dispersive band C2. The effective masses of holes have obscure direction-dependence, which could be distinguished in band structures shown as Fig. 2a. Moreover, the difference between effective mass of electrons and holes is larger than 0.25me indicating effective separation of electron–hole pairs and the small probability of recombination for photogenerated carriers.

The carrier mobility is another vital parameter for 2D nanomaterials. It is shown that the carrier mobility in 2D materials is dominated by acoustic phonon scattering via intra- and intervalley deformation potential (DP) couplings at room temperature.44,45 The mobility can be estimated by the DP theory proposed by Bardeen and Shockley.46 Based on the effective mass approximation, the carrier mobility is determined as follows:47 (2)where e is the electron charge, m* is the carrier effective mass, KB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature, Ed is the DP constant denoting the shift of the band edges (Eedge) (CBM for electrons and VBM for holes) induced by strain (ε): dEedge/dε, and C = [∂2E/∂ε2]/S0 is the elastic modulus of the 2D system activated by strain, where E is the total energy and S0 is the area of the system. The isotropic strain is defined as ε = Δc/c0, where the lattice constants of the freestanding monolayer equals to c. The calculated relative energy and the CBM and VBM positions of p-SiC monolayers as a function of the uniaxial strain εx along the x direction are shown in Fig. 4a and b. It is shown that the linear fittings of relative position of CBM and VBM and the parabolic fitting of total energies fit well with theoretical calculations in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The elastic stiffness C of the p-SiC monolayer is estimated to be a constant with the value of 71 N m−1. The DP constant Ed for electrons (originates from CBM shifting: EdC) and holes (originates from VBM shifting: EdV) is estimated to be 3.0 and 2.9 eV, respectively. The eqn (2) shows that the carrier mobility is a scalar determined by four variables: DP constant Ed, elastic stiffness C, and effective mass of carrier and temperature. Since all involved variables have been investigated, at the room temperature of 300 K the electron mobility at the CBM along the x direction is about 2.5 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the hole mobility at the VBM is about 1.9 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.3 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 for two different degenerate edges at the VBM. The carrier mobility of the Si-based pentagonal monolayer can be compared with or even higher than that of many other 2D semiconductors, examples including MoS2 monolayer,48 phosphorene,49 InSe multilayers50 and some organic electronic materials.51,52 Furthermore, the electronic structures and band gaps can be modulated regularly by isotropic strains as shown in Fig. 4b. By exerting isotropic strains ranging from −4% to 10%, two distinct dividing lines are drawn at point ε = −1% and ε = 9%, respectively, which indicate that isotropic strain can introduce a phase-transition into p-SiC monolayers. The band gaps decrease monotonically with VBM at the K points and CBM at the X point under isotropic strains ranging from −1% to 9%. When isotropic strain was in the range of −4% to 2%, the band edges change with VBM at the Γ point and CBM at the X point. While for isotropic strain larger than 9%, semiconducting p-SiC transforms to a metallic monolayer. Moreover, to ensure the stability of the strain induced system, we examine the phonon spectra as well as the evolution of geometrical structures and free energies during AIMD simulation for the p-SiC monolayer under the strain of −2% and 2%, respectively. The results indicate that no imaginary frequency exists in the phonon spectra, no bond is broken and the evolution of free energy is stable during AIMD simulation at 300 K for 3 ps. It is predicted that p-SiC could be thermodynamically stable by introducing proper strains. We believe the 2D pentagon Si-based semiconductors with extraordinary carrier mobility and strain-controllable electronic structures may have promising applications in high speed electronic devices like field effect transistors (FET) and high compatibility with current Si-dominated nanodevices.

p-SiC monolayer for hydrogen generation via water splitting
Due to the big difference between high carrier mobilities μe and μh, the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs will be decreased greatly. Therefore, we wonder if the p-SiC monolayer could be a new candidate beyond g-C3N4, which can be used into photocatalytic reactions, especially water splitting. The band gap of the p-SiC monolayer is estimated to be 2.35 eV by HSE hybrid functional corresponding to a wavelength of 528 nm, showing a semiconductor-character absorption in the green region of the visible spectra. Analogous to g-C3N4, the band gap is large enough to meet the requirement of the oxidation reduction potential (ORP) for the water-splitting reaction (1.23 eV). Furthermore, in addition to the magnitude of the band gap, the location of the VBM and CBM with respect to the reduction and oxidation levels in water-splitting is equally important. We have calculated the work function and the band edges of p-SiC with respect to the vacuum level by the HSE functional. The work function of p-SiC is estimated to be 6.28 eV. It is known to all that the value for the reduction level of hydrogen is μHe+/H2 = −4.44 eV with respect to the vacuum level. The calculated value for the oxidation level of H2O is μOh2/H2O = −5.67 eV. The schematic diagram of band level alignment of the p-SiC monolayer for water-splitting photocatalysts is shown in Fig. 5. Our analysis shows that the oxidation level is located 0.61 eV higher than the VBM level, which could permit transfer of holes with a low driving force. And the reduction level of H+ and the oxidation potential of H2O are right lying in the middle of the band gap, which indicates that the reduction process is energetically possible. These physical insights provide eloquent evidence that the p-SiC monolayer could have promising application to act as a metal-free photocatalyst for hydrogen generation by water splitting. It is worth to mention that the absolute energy point of the VBM and CBM should be shifted by introducing isotropic or uniaxial strain. After examination, we further determine that the work function and the absolute energy point of band edges could not be changed too much to affect the electronic properties as well as the potential applications of Si-based pentagon monolayers by exerting proper strain. As for p-SiC, by introducing strains ranging from −1% to 1%, band gap changes are in the range of 0.3 eV, while work function changes are within 0.1 eV. Consequently, the absolute positions of band edges for p-SiC still meet the fundamental condition for photocatalytic water splitting.

Conclusions
In summary, we have designed a new type of all pentagon based monolayers p-SiX on the basis of okayamalite structure Ca2SiB2O7. The dynamical stabilities of p-SiX (X = B, C, N) monolayers are proved by phonon spectra with the absence of imaginary frequencies. AIMD simulations provide eloquent evidence for the thermal stability of p-SiX monolayers, which can withstand temperature even at 600 K with tiny lattice distortion and none bond broken. Electronic structures reveal that p-SiX (X = C and N) is a semiconductor with band gaps of 2.36 and 4.98 eV, respectively. Furthermore, small anistropic effective masses and high carrier mobilities up to 2500 cm2 V−1 s−1 are quantitatively evaluated. Besides, the band gap of p-SiC can be modulated monotonically by reasonable isotropic strain which indicates the promising application of p-SiC in electronic devices beyond other current 2D materials. More meaningfully, sufficient discussions indicate that both the band gap and the band edges of p-SiC can meet the requirement of the reduction and oxidation levels in water splitting. Our study reflects that p-SiC can be a potential photocatalyst for water splitting beyond g-C3N4 or other traditional photocatalysts with high carrier mobility and low recombination rate.
