    , Accepted 8th December 2015First published on 10th December 2015AbstractUnderstanding the metal–support interactions between Ni ansd La2O3 has helped us design an improved catalyst for the ethanol steam reforming (ESR) reaction. Information from in situ X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) has helped us to prepare a Ni-based catalyst, in which strong metal–support interactions (SMSI) maximize the hydrogen yield by suppressing undesired reaction pathways. It was found that the Ni, formed as nanoparticles, was well dispersed both in and on the La2O3. The Ni/La2O3 catalyst, when compared to a Ni/SiO2 catalyst, yielded twice as much H2 (3.7 mol H2 per mol EtOH) at 395 °C by both inhibiting methanation (CO + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O) and promoting the water gas shift reaction (CO + H2O → CO2 + H2). It is expected that our enhanced understanding of Ni/La2O3 physical/chemical interactions will help us design new catalysts for various catalytic applications.
Introduction
With increasingly rapid industrialization the need to satisfy growing energy demands has been thrown into sharp focus.1 Fossil fuels, due to their cost and ease of extraction, are still the main global energy source; however, the ongoing consumption of fossil fuels is creating serious environmental problems. How to address these problems is an important unresolved issue.
Among the renewable energy technologies, e.g. solar energy, wind power, marine energy etc., hydrogen fuel cells that use hydrogen, sourced from hydrocarbons or ethanol, offer conversion efficiency and environmental benefits.2 Of the means used to generate hydrogen, ethanol steam reforming3–5 [ESR (C2H5OH + 3H2O → 6H2 + 2CO2)] is commonly preferred due to its minimal environmental impact.6,7
Transition metals such as Rh, Pt, Ru, Pd Ir, Co, Ni, Cu and Fe (ref. 8) show significant activity and selectivity for ESR. Of these, Rh shows a particularly impressive activity; however, its high cost limits its more widespread application. Apart from the noble metals, Ni shows promise due to its C–C and OH bond breaking activity.9 However, Ni-based catalysts still face issues related to their high working temperature window (>500 °C), sintering and coke deposition. Many authors have proposed strategies to prevent coke deposition and agglomeration on Ni-based catalysts, e.g. Nichele et al.10 used CaO-doped Ni/ZrO2 to improve coking resistance, while Carrero et al.11 used Cu–Ni, supported on high surface area SBA-15a, to prevent sintering at high temperatures.
The pathways for hydrogen production in a generalized ESR scheme9 are shown below:Dehydrogenation: C2H5OH → C2H4O + H2Acetaldehyde decomposition: C2H4O → CH4 + COAcetaldehyde steam reforming: C2H4O + H2O → 3H2 + 2CO
In addition to the main reaction pathways, some important side reactions may occur:Water gas shift reaction (WGSR): CO + H2O → CO2 + H2Methanation: CO + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O
Ni is a well-known methanation catalyst:12 during low-temperature ESR (<500 °C), methanation may occur, consuming large volumes of H2 and CO. Generally, catalytic methanation on supported nickel catalysts is dependent on the active phase's particle or crystal size13 and the interactions between the active metal and its support (SMSI).14 If this side reaction can be suppressed we can potentially maximize hydrogen yield, reduce energy loss, and minimize catalytic sintering.
Recently, SMSI have been widely discussed15–17 and interpreted in terms of how electron transfer can lead to tailored catalytic properties.18 The catalysts derived from ABO3 perovskite have many features that encourage their use in dry reforming of methane (DRM),19,20 ESR21,22 and oxidative ethanol steam reforming (OESR).23–25 LaNiO3 is an easily reducible perovskite structure that was first used by de Lima et al.21 in a partially reduced form to enhance ESR activity and stability. However, the current literature focus remains on how carbon formation can be inhibited on the dispersed metal particles during ESR.26,27 At the time of writing, little experimental evidence has been offered to substantiate the existence of SMSI and how they affect reaction paths. To address this issue and explore the underlying catalytic mechanism we prepared two catalysts with supports shown to be inert towards ESR: (i) Ni/La2O3, derived from perovskite, and (ii) Ni/SiO2, prepared by a sol–gel method with a similar Ni loading/size.
Experimental
Catalyst preparation
LaNiO3, was prepared using a co-precipitation method. Initially, 100 mL of 0.6 M solutions of both aqueous lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (98% ACROS) and nickel nitrate hexahydrate (99% ACROS) were mixed (1:1 molar ratio) and stirred while NaOHaq (3.2 M, 400 mL) was added dropwise (for 1 h) to produce precipitation. The suspension was filtered and repeatedly washed with DI water and the product dried at 110 °C overnight. Finally, the sample was calcined at 400 °C for 2 h and then at 700 °C for 6 h (ramp rate 5 °C min−1). The catalyst derived from LaNiO3 is denoted as Ni/La2O3. The sol–gel method28 was used to synthesize Ni/SiO2. Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (0.01 mol, 99% ACROS) and citric acid (0.015 mol) were dissolved into 100 mL of absolute ethanol and stirred at 60 °C for 4 h. Then, a solution of deionized water and absolute ethanol (molar ratio, 3:1) was added. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (5.62 g, TEOS) was added dropwise into the solution. After drying at 80 °C overnight, the precursor was calcined at 450 °C under air for 3 h. All catalysts were reduced in situ in hydrogen at various temperatures. For the Ni/La2O3 catalyst, the reduction was performed at 550 °C for 1 h (heating rate 7 °C min−1); while for Ni/SiO2 the reduction was performed at 600 °C for 1 h. The Ni loading for both samples was 26.5 wt%.
Characterization
Specimens were characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) with either a Bruker D2 Phaser X-ray powder diffraction spectrophotometer (in-house) or by using the synchrotron light source (to record in situ XRD) at the beamline 01C of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Hsinchu, Taiwan. The electron storage ring was operated at 1.5 GeV with a beam current of 100–200 mA. The XRD pattern was recorded using a wavelength of 0.5167 Å for limited angular regions at room temperature. The wavelength was changed to 1.5418 Å as the energy of CuKα1. The crystallite size of the nickel was estimated using the Scherrer equation. In situ X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) were obtained using the beamlines 17C and 20A at the NSRRC as above. The electron storage ring was operated at 1.5 GeV with a beam current of 300 mA. Hard XAS were recorded at beamline 17C, with a double Si (111) crystal monochromator being used for energy selection. One collimating mirror and one refocusing mirror, both coated with Rh, were respectively located upstream and downstream of the monochromator. These two mirrors also served to reject high harmonics. The focused beam size at the sample position was 4 × 2 mm2. Soft XAS, made in fluorescence mode for the oxygen K-edge, using an ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of 1 × 10−10 torr, were recorded at the beamline 20A. A 6 m high energy spherical grating monochromator (6 m-HSGM) was used to perform the energy scan. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was conducted using a Philips Tecnai F30 FEI-TEM at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The powder samples for the HRTEM were prepared (in ethanol) by ultrasonic dispersion prior to deposition and drying on carbon-coated copper grids. The reduction behaviour of the samples was measured by temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) controlled by an AutoChem II analyzer. Samples (50 mg) were heated in 10% H2 at a flow rate of 30 ml min−1, with the temperature being increased from room temperature to 600 °C. Prior to the H2 uptake experiment, all catalysts were reduced in situ in 10% H2/N2 at various temperatures (1 h) and then cooled to room temperature using high purity N2.
Catalytic activity measurement
The samples' catalytic activities with respect to the ESR reaction were evaluated at atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed reactpr. Catalyst (50 mg) was placed in a quartz tubular reactor allowing activity to be evaluated using stepwise temperature changes from 325 to 500 °C (ramp rate 1 °C min−1) with 30 minutes waiting time for reaction equilibrium at each analysis reaction temperature with measurements taken for each 35 °C reaction temperature increase. A liquid reactant mixture of H2O/EtOH = 6 molar ratio was introduced at a flow rate of 0.005 mL min−1 and further eluted by He (15 mL min−1). The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV = 1.74 h−1) was defined as the ratio between the inlet feed (ethanol) mass flow rate and the mass of catalyst. It should be noted that a higher steam/ethanol ratio was meant for evaluation of catalyst but the condition is also associated with higher energy penalty. Prior to the reaction, samples were activated by reduction with 10% hydrogen (at a temperature determined by temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) measurements) for 1 hour to ensure that the nickel species (NiO or LaNiO3) was reduced to metallic Ni. The gaseous products were characterized by gas chromatography (GC) on an Acme 6100 instrument equipped with a pulsed discharge helium ionization detector (PDHID). Three factors were selected to evaluate the ESR reaction of the samples: (i) the conversion of ethanol [XEthanol(%)], (ii) the product distribution [Pi(%)] and (iii) the hydrogen yield (YH2) which was calculated using the mole ratios of MEthanol and products (Mi), as defined by eqn (1), (2) and (3), respectively: (1) (2) (3)
Results and discussion
H2-TPR and morphology analysis
Profiles (a) and (b) in Fig. 1 represent H2-TPR measurements of the LaNiO3 (perovskite type) and the as-prepared Ni/SiO2 samples, respectively. LaNiO3 shows three reduction peaks at 305 °C, 339 °C and 489 °C, with the first two slightly overlapping. By referring to the results of in situ XRD in Fig. 2, the first reduction peak at 305 °C was identified as originating from the partial reduction of LaNiO3, i.e. with the perovskite phase retained. The second reduction peak at 339 °C was identified as Ni metal, reduced from NiO, which indicates that not all the Ni participates in the perovskite phase. Finally, the third peak at 489 °C is associated with the complete reduction of bulk perovskite. The as-prepared Ni/SiO2 shows three main reduction peaks. The first two at 329 and 402 °C represent the reduction of NiO to Ni, while the broad reduction peak at 534 °C is associated with Ni release from the SiO2 matrix.

The TEM image of LaNiO3 perovskite (particle diameters ∼50–100 nm) is shown in Fig. 3(a). The Ni/La2O3 catalyst is shown in Fig. 3(b)–(d). Comparing Fig. 3(a) LaNiO3 and Fig. 3(b), i.e. after pretreatment with 10% H2 at 550 °C for 1 h, it is apparent that the perovskite phase is transformed – this observation is in good agreement with the in situ XRD (Fig. 2). Notable are the well-dispersed Ni nanoparticles (NPs) on the La2O3 support (average diameter 5.9 nm; see TEM results and XRD, Fig. S1†). Interestingly, Fig. 3(c) and the enlarged section of Fig. 3(d) show one Ni NP with a clear Ni (111) lattice on La2O3 surrounded by the lanthanum oxide support. This indicates that Ni NPs can be partially embedded into the La2O3 support after reduction. For the Ni/SiO2 catalyst shown in Fig. 4, the Ni NPs are well dispersed (average diameter of 6 nm; see TEM results and XRD, Fig. S2†). From the above results, the Ni/La2O3 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts have similar Ni particle sizes.

Analysis of the strong interaction between Ni and La2O3

In situ XAS was used to study the electronic structures of the Ni/La2O3 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts. Fig. 5 shows the Ni K-edge XANES of the Ni/La2O3 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts (metallic Ni foil is also included as a reference). The dominant XANES peak (white line, denoted as WL) at the Ni K-edge is an absorption threshold resonance, which is assigned to the allowed orbital transition from 1s to 4p.29 As shown in this figure, the Ni/La2O3, Ni/SiO2 and metallic Ni foil had the same resonance, thereby indicating that the oxidation state of Ni in the Ni/La2O3 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts was that of metallic Ni. However, a white line of slightly higher intensity was obtained for Ni/La2O3, suggesting that the Ni atoms' orbital electron density was modified by interaction between the Ni NPs and the La2O3 support.30 The interaction between the Ni NPs and the La2O3 support was examined using O K-edge XAS on Ni/La2O3 and Ni/SiO2, as shown in Fig. 6 and 7, respectively. To facilitate comparison, La2O3, SiO2 and LaNiO3 samples are also included as references. The spectra reveal excitations from the O 1s orbital to unoccupied states.31 The O K-edge spectrum of the Ni/La2O3 catalyst in Fig. 6(a) has two major excitation peaks: O 1s to Ni 3d–O 2p from 530 to 531.7 eV and O 1s to La 5d–O 2p from 533 to 537 eV. The small shoulder from 530 to 531.7 eV is due to the transitions of the O 1s electron to the antibonding O 2p state hybridized with the 3d metal states.32 In contrast to Ni/La2O3 catalyst, there is no peak between 530 and 531.7 eV for Ni/SiO2, see Fig. 7(a), which indicates that there is no strong interaction between Ni and the SiO2 support. This result can be explained by the chemical environment of the Ni NPs in Ni/La2O3 in which most Ni NPs formed by reduction migrate from the lattice to the surface,33 while others become partially embedded in the lanthanum oxide, producing multiple interfaces between the Ni and its support.

Evaluation of catalytic activity

Fig. 8 shows ESR reaction conversion profiles as a function of reaction temperature (°C) from 325 to 500 °C. At 325 °C the Ni/SiO2 catalyst shows a maximal conversion of ethanol (100%), whereas the Ni/La2O3 catalyst showed only 32% conversion; however, as the reaction temperature increased from 325 to 395 °C, the conversion approached 100%. Generally, ESR depends on the catalyst's ‘active surface area’ which may be the case with Ni/La2O3 and Ni/SiO2, as the Ni NP sizes were similar [see XRD (Fig. S1 and S2†) and TEM (Fig. 3 and 4)]. H2 uptake data were obtained to determine the active areas; see Table S1.† The H2 uptakes for Ni/SiO2 and Ni/La2O3 were 552.8 and 54.4 μmol per g respectively, indicating that the main effect of SMSI is the suppression of H2 adsorption34 or metallic Ni partial embedding into the support to reduce the exposed Ni surface area.

Fig. 9 shows ESR product distribution profiles, as a function of reaction temperature (°C), from 325 to 500 °C, for Ni/SiO2 and Ni/La2O3. For the Ni/SiO2 catalyst at 325 °C, H2 (46.6%), CO (18.9%) and CH4 (25.3%) were the main gaseous products, with a small amount of CO2 (9.2%). With the reaction temperature raised to 360 °C, in addition to the main gaseous products H2 (50.14%) and CH4 (26.37%), the concentration of CO decreased to 0.34%, while the concentration of CO2 increased to 23.14%. The CO concentration remained low for temperatures between 395 and 465 °C. At relatively high CH4 concentrations our results agree with the existing catalytic Ni methanation literature.35 The Ni/La2O3 catalyst was tested for comparison. At 325 °C, H2 (62.2%), CH3CHO (20.2%), CO2 (8.2%) and CH4 (6.1%) were the main gaseous products with a small amount of CO (3.3%). At 395 °C, the concentration of CH4 was ∼8.3% with the CO being only ∼1.6%. Within a reaction temperature window between 360 and 500 °C, the Ni/La2O3 catalyst gave the greatest H2 yield (3.7 mol H2 per mol EtOH at 395 °C), with lower concentrations of methane, but higher CO.
 Fig. 9  ESR reaction of (a) Ni/SiO2 and (b) Ni/La2O3 catalysts with WHSV = 1.74 h−1 and H2O/EtOH = 6. The conversion of ethanol for all catalysts at the reaction temperature range between 395 and 500 °C was 100%, and the temperature rate was 1 °C min−1, with 30 min waiting time for the reaction equilibrium at each analysis temperature that was taken every 35 °C increase in the reaction temperature. 
The Ni/SiO2 catalyst, having the largest surface area, gave the highest hydrogen yield below 360 °C (1.64 mol H2 per mol EtOH), cf. Ni/La2O3 (0.51 mol H2 per mol EtOH). However, within the reaction temperature set between 360 and 500 °C, the situation was reversed with the Ni/La2O3 catalyst giving a greater H2 yield. This may be explained as follows. After the dehydrogenation of ethanol, the acetaldehyde generated can undergo two competing reaction paths,36 (i) decomposition into CH4 and CO (CH3CHO → CO + CH4, or (ii) acetaldehyde steam reforming (CH3CHO + H2O → 2CO + 3H2). From either of these reaction paths, the water gas shift reaction (WGSR) can take place (CO + H2O → CO2 + H2).37 In contrast to Ni/La2O3, the Ni/SiO2 catalyst produces less CO (0.3%) and more CH4 (23.01%) at 395 °C, implying that the Ni/SiO2 catalyst also promotes methanation, producing methane and water by consuming CO and H2.
In order to confirm this hypothesis, mixed gases comprising CO (29.5 torr), H2 (295 torr) and H2O (334 torr) were used as reactants (at 395 °C) with the two catalysts, as seen in Fig. S3.† For Ni/SiO2 [Fig. S3(a)†], H2 (89%) and CH4 (8.2%) were the main gaseous products plus CO2 (2.8%), with most CO being consumed by methanation. In contrast, in the case with Ni/La2O3, the concentrations of H2, CH4, and CO2 were 92%, 1.1% and ∼6.9% respectively. With this catalyst, the CO produced was more likely to go through the WGSR. In addition, the CH4/CO species in the given ESR with Ni/La2O3 were significantly suppressed. The SMSI significantly affects the reaction pathways by promoting the water gas shift reaction. The water dissociation provides the required oxygen source to remove CH4/CO and this could be attributed to the La2O3 support and the SMSI between Ni and the support, as discussed in the literature,38,39 where the interaction significantly enhances the ability of the admetal to dissociate the O–H bond in the adsorbed water molecule to produce a high hydrogen yield (YH2).38 At 395 °C, the Ni/La2O3 catalyst showed the highest hydrogen yield (3.7 mol H2 per mol EtOH), which clearly indicated its high ESR activity at mild temperatures, especially when compared with Ni/SiO2 catalyst. Table 1 gives a comparative summary of the various Ni-based catalysts for ESR.40–43 Despite differences in the steam/ethanol ratio, the Ni/La2O3 catalyst shows the highest hydrogen yield. From the observations and experiments above, we conclude that SMSI plays an important role in catalysis. We have demonstrated that the interactions can be effectively used to suppress methanation while generating higher hydrogen yields, thus helping us to design a superior catalyst for ethanol steam reforming.

Morphology and TGA analysis for used catalysts
The carbon balance for ESR reaction on Ni/La2O3 catalyst is shown in Table S2.† Carbon deposition has been frequently mentioned in the literature as a problem associated with Ni-based catalysts. Whisker carbon44 or carbon nanotubes result from adsorbed carbon atoms on Ni particles, this adsorbed carbon later diffuses and nucleates into a carbon fiber.45 The comparative morphologies of used Ni/La2O3 and used Ni/SiO2 catalysts after the ESR reaction at 395 °C for 14 h are shown in Fig. 10. The sizes of the nickel NPs were ∼8.3 nm for used Ni/La2O3 and 13 nm for used Ni/SiO2. In addition, most carbon fibers, or carbon nanotubes, grew from metallic nickel.
 Fig. 10  TEM images of used (a) Ni/La2O3 and (b) Ni/SiO2 catalysts. 
Fatsikostas et al.46 proposed that the La2O3 support can react with CO2 to form a lanthanum oxy-carbonate species that reacts with surface carbon, thereby removing carbon deposits by the reaction La2O2CO3 + C–Ni → La2O3 + 2CO + Ni. Thus, the La2O2CO3 species is believed to function as a scavenger able to clean the deposited carbon from the Ni surface. As shown in Fig. S4,† the used Ni/La2O3 indeed exhibits similar XRD patterns to La2O2CO3. Additionally, SMSI also inhibits coke deposition in close proximity to metallic Ni; however, the accumulation of carbon deposits may move particulate Ni away from the support.47,48
Coke deposition for Ni/SiO2 and Ni/La2O3 was quantified using TGA measurements; see Fig. S5.† The TGA of used Ni/SiO2 [Fig. S5(a)†] exhibited a weight loss (D1) at around 400–600 °C that was the oxidation of carbon filaments,49 while, in contrast, the used Ni/La2O3 showed distinct weight losses in various temperature ranges, i.e. 200–400 °C (D1), 400–600 °C (D2), 620–656 °C (D3) and 656–718 °C (D4) (ref. 22 and 49), suggesting that the ranges D2 and D3 were the oxidation of carbon filaments and graphitic carbon, respectively, and D4 was thought to result mainly from the lanthanum decomposition, i.e.: La2O2CO3 → La2O3 + CO2.50 In addition, the weight gain D1 was the oxidation of nickel to nickel oxide. Furthermore, the total wt% of carbon was estimated to be about 18.5% for Ni/La2O3 and 57.8% for Ni/SiO2. In addition to the support as a scavenger to remove the coke deposition, the less carbon deposits on Ni/La2O3 catalyst could be also due to the less exposed Ni particles, which are the active sites for carbon deposition. Furthermore, SMSI not only favours the dissociation of O–H bond to improve catalytic activity but also makes the cleavage of C–O bonds more difficult to prevent coke deposition by inhibiting the Boudouard reaction (2CO → C + CO2) during the ESR.51–53 Therefore, as seen in the case of Ni/La2O3, the strong interaction not only inhibits the particles from growing during the reaction at high temperatures but also contributes to the decreased amount of carbon deposition. This physical/chemical phenomenon is not found with Ni/SiO2.
Conclusions
In summary, using LaNiO3 as the catalyst precursor; we observed, using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and HR-TEM analysis, nanosized Ni particles both supported on and embedded within the La2O3 support. SMSI was shown to inhibit methanation and enhance the stability of the nanocatalyst while promoting the WGSR during ESR. In comparison, coke formation on Ni/La2O3 was also significantly reduced. It was found that the Ni/La2O3 nanocatalyst showed a much higher hydrogen yield at 395 °C compared to the data reported in the literature. Moreover, the work not only discusses the catalytic role of supports but also shows that the interaction between metal and support can significantly influence the reaction pathways. In addition to these effects, the SMSI prevented Ni NPs from agglomerating at high temperatures, while also suppressing coke deposition. We also demonstrate approaches of preparing nanocatalyst with desirable SMSI properties which can hold promise for the design and preparation of nanocatalysts for various heterogeneous reactions in the future.
