These assessments are well-known to be useful in developmental stages of a product in order to identify the bottlenecks for the up-scaling in its production phase for several aspects spanning from economics through design to functionality. An LCA study was performed to quantify the energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from electricity use in the manufacture of a light-weight lamp based on a plastic foil, a lithium-polymer battery, a polymer solar cell, printed circuitry, blocking diode, switch and a white light emitting semiconductor diode. The polymer solar cell employed in this prototype presents a power conversion efficiency in the range of 2 to 3% yielding energy payback times (EPBT) in the range of 1.3–2 years. Based on this it is worthwhile to undertake a life-cycle study on the complete product integrated polymer solar cell. We have compared this portable lighting system with other lighting solutions, namely: a kerosene lamp in a remote rural area in Africa (Ethiopia), as a replacement of a silicon PV based lamp, in place of a torch with non-rechargeable lead-acid battery and instead of a battery charging station. The analysis reveals that the OPV lamp has a significant advantage provided that some of the challenges facing this novel technology are efficiently met such that it can enter the market of portable lighting devices.

Broader context

Polymer solar cells have been researched broadly in the past decade and are progressing towards large scale manufacture, commercialization and product integration. Most reports present somewhat unrealistic views on the capacity of the technology which must be viewed as marginal compared to existing solar cell technologies. In contrast to most other solar cell technologies polymer solar cells ideally do not present an abundance problem and it is currently the only solar cell technology with manufacturing schemes fast enough to reach production levels of a gigawatt-a-day. Recent efforts have analyzed the impact that polymer solar cell production has on the environment through life cycle analysis. Of the few reports available only one report was based on real production data showing energy payback times similar to the 2 year service life. In this work we address the impact on the energy payback time when this inferior but highly adaptable technology is integrated into products in the form of lighting solutions for developing countries and find energy payback times on the order of 10 years which is significantly longer than the service life. When exchanging existing lighting solutions with the polymer solar cell based lighting solutions energy payback times on the order of 1–2 months are obtained.

1. Introduction

Polymer solar cells are a technology that has been touted as the only inherently low cost photovoltaic technology1–4 for which there are no known limitations in the abundance of the elements in the materials. Of the inorganic photovoltaic technologies only silicon (crystalline, microcrystalline and amorphous) has no identified material shortage problems while many of the potentially low cost inorganic photovoltaics are not scalable to multi-GW production volumes due to the low natural abundance for some of the elements that enter as active components in those solar cells (e.g. CdTe, CIGS).5,6Polymer solar cells have been shown recently to yield energy pay-back times of 1–2 years and very low CO2 equivalent emission figures of less than 40 g per kW hel.7–9 The polymer solar cell technology was thus found to be very similar to other PV technologies in its current form and has the potential to outperform all other known PV technologies through process and technology development. Recently a new record beyond 8% in efficiency was reached.10 The vision of polymer solar cells is their use in electrical energy production in large solar panels and while this has been documented and grid connected polymer solar cell modules have been reported,11 this area of application is still some way into the future. The current areas of application for polymer solar cells are niche products and stand alone systems. It is of considerable interest to carry out life-cycle analysis of polymer solar cells in such a context. Recently polymer solar cells were employed in conjunction with white light emitting diodes, polymer lithium ion batteries and flexible printed electronic circuits in lighting applications for the “Lighting Africa” initiative (Fig. 1).12 The effort sought to provide low cost reading light and simple rechargeable lighting in developing countries without an electricity grid. The results are very promising and demonstrated the scalability and adaptability of the polymer solar cell technology. This can be ascribed to the observation that polymer solar cells have an exceptionally steep learning curve as compared to for instance crystalline silicon solar cells.13

When contemplating large scale distribution of a new technology into a developing country several important issues must be examined carefully. Amongst those is the life-cycle analysis of the entire product. The LCA study is a holistic approach that not only provides information about how much time is taken in returning the energy employed in the manufacturing of a product, which is important in the early stages of development; but also allows for the identification of bottlenecks, a key-factor in the production stages; and make it possible to achieve reductions in the environmental impacts of the product (the so-called eco-design or sustainable design). Furthermore, it can be viewed as an inventory of emissions that gives the greenhouse mitigation potential of the product.
In this case the lamp comprises several components in addition to the polymer solar cell: a lithium-polymer battery, a LED and protective layers, which have not yet been analyzed from the point of view of their sustainability. However, all the components of the device are Pb and hazardous substances free and the battery is RoHS compliant. All of this makes the lamp a candidate for an eco-friendly and eco-labelled product. The eco-label evaluates a product's impact on the environment throughout the whole lifecycle and proves that climate requirements are taken into account when designing the product, as reflected in the Integrated Product Policy of the EU.14
2. Methodology of a life-cycle analysis
The present analysis was performed according to ISO 14040 guidelines15 to quantify the energy use and GHG emissions from electricity consumption for an organic solar module based lamp. The scope and boundary of each analysis have to be clearly stated. In our study we have focused on six main stages:
(1) Definition of system boundary and functional unit.
(2) Compilation of material inventory for the production of an organic solar lamp, even including materials not present in the final product.
(3) Definition of a lifetime of the unit, taking into account several degradation studies and forecasts.16–18
(4) Compilation of the energy embedded in the manufacture of materials from raw materials to initial input into the manufacture machinery.
(5) Energy embedded in the direct process.
(6) Compilation of life-cycle GHG emissions, being necessary to adopt a fuel mix when there are electricity inputs.
Once accomplished all these stages, indicators and environmental factors, such as EPBT, GPBT (Greenhouse Pay-Back Time), and equivalent CO2 emission factor, can be calculated.
A life-cycle assessment usually includes a life cycle cost analysis, but up to now just some attempts to detail the cost structure for polymer solar cells have been made.4,12,13,19 So this cost study is beyond our purposes.
The system boundaries shown in Fig. 2 will include the raw materials production and the end-of-life, i.e. decommissioning. There are several functional units along the present study. One chosen functional unit, a 104 cm2 lamp, has served as the base of calculations on the energy embedded in the materials and for comparing with other lighting products. Another functional unit has served for comparisons for products that are investigated, therefore a functional unit in hours of daily operation over a period of one year was chosen.
 Fig. 2  System boundaries of the OPV life-cycle assessment. 
Data for the specific lamp materials were gathered from different sources. Where possible, we have extracted data from manufacturers, free databases and the literature. For some new materials and processes we had to create data by use of knowledge gathered for subcomponents. Calculations of the fabrication of the organic solar module process were based on our previous studies on organic solar cell module production, since the same materials have been used as active layer and for electrodes and buffer layers that were included in this device.8,9
The production of the lamp was assumed to take place in Europe. For the OPV lamp, production of polymer solar cells is located in Denmark. The blocking diode, the LED, the battery and all electric and electronic components are commonly manufactured in China or East Asia. However, since it is not possible to quantify the emissions in these locations, these components were assumed to be fabricated from a European energetic supply, adding the transport from these places to the location of the manufacturing and from there to the place of use.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Material inventory
A material inventory summarizes the amount of raw materials used to manufacture a unit of a product, i.e. here an OPV lamp with a total area of 104 cm2. The subsequent energy calculations will take this into account.
The OPV lamp comprises several layers which can be seen in Fig. 3. With the product specifications, shown in Table 2, all the materials were tracked back to the point of resource extraction, using cradle-to-gate data from manufacturers (Amcor, AEC, OSRAM), literature and public databases. Materials not found in databases were modelled using stoichiometric calculations and estimations that will be detailed.

3.2. Life-cycle energy use
All the manufacturing, assembly, transportation of the materials for the organic solar cell and the balance of system (BOS) such as battery, LEDs, blocking diode, supporting frame and their accessories, consume energy, which is here referred to as embodied energy†. LCA studies for photovoltaics usually show a high variation in results and conclusions. Crucial issues when compiling a life-cycle inventory (LCI) are the difficulty in accessing data (few manufacturers provide reliable and verifiable data) and the uncertainty in power mixes assumed for the material production processes and process-specific emissions. This gives rise to some difficulties in the present study since the manufacturing process of some components has been carried out in different steps and/or different countries, having different energetic conditions, as was described above.

3.2.1. 
            Transport
          . 
An extra energy requirement in the manufacturing phase is the energy used in transporting the different elements to the assembly site. The transport of all materials from providers to manufacturers has been taken into account. Estimating transport often involves making a qualified guess about what the solar powered device industry will look like in a few years. For example, it is expected that there will only be a few battery manufacturers. The transport, mentioned above, was assumed to be carried out by truck for short transport distances and by boat for longer transport distances. The energy used in transporting all the materials associated with the OPV lamp has been estimated according to specific transportation energy assumptions extracted from EEA (2003): 0.83 MJ t−1 km−1 by heavy truck and 0.11 MJ t−1 km−1 when shipping transportation.20 OPV modules, LEDs, batteries, and blocking diodes are mounted at Mekoprint Electronics A/S, located in Aalborg, Denmark. The energy consumed in transport will be added in the following sections to the total energy requirements.


3.2.2. Construction phase. 
3.2.2.1. Organic solar modules. 
Only a few studies have undertaken the task of estimating the energy consumption in the manufacturing of polymer solar cells7–9,21 and only one has been based on real data for a semi-industrial processing using roll-to-roll methods realized at Risø National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy.9 The energy consumptions during manufacture of flexible organic PV modules‡ were found to vary between 2.34 GJ per kWp by Roes et al.7 almost 4 GJ per kWp by Anctil et al.21 and 7.33 GJ per kWp from our previous study.9 These variations can be attributed to different technological assumptions or processing methods and system boundaries. The solar cell modules were based on a manufacturing procedure known as ProcessOne22 which involves the use of slot-die coating for the preparation of individual solar cells in the form of stripes that are then serially connected in the final screen printing step where the back electrode is formed.
In the present study, we used the data already published,9 for reaching the embodied energy in a polymer based module produced according to ProcessOne.22 The same procedure is used for the organic solar module embedded in the OPV lamp, which was formerly detailed and where the only changes are the size of the modules and the use of different screens for printing the back contacts. Since the final module outline should be small this implied the slot-die coating of narrow stripes with a short separation of 5 mm to maximize the usage of area. We had estimated energy requirements for the materials in a polymer based modules production to be 302.27 MJ m−2 that is equivalent to 29.39 k Wh m−2. Given that the patterns for producing the modules are different, the amount of some materials such as solvents or inks in the OPV lamp is about 30% per linear metre less than in the former study. Table 3 summarizes the most recent life-cycle inventory for OPV modules.

3.2.2.2. Protective layers. 
As can be observed in the exploded view of the OPV device shown in Fig. 3, there are several layers for giving both protection and support structure to the lamp. All of them are considered made of the same quality of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with different thicknesses listed in Table 2. This polymer is well studied from the industrial point of view and known to require 80.75 MJ kg−1 of primary energy for its manufacture.23 A detailed material and energy inventory is shown in Table 4.

3.2.2.3. Battery. 
A light weight lithium–polymer (Li–Po) battery was included in the OPV lamp. When compared to a lithium-ion battery, Li–Po has a greater life-cycle degradation rate. However, more than 500 charge–discharge cycles can be carried out before the capacity drops to 80% and these batteries are solid and have the safest design. Data about energy requirements for small and medium size electronic facilities, such as batteries, LEDs and diodes, are increasing as LCA studies are becoming widespread, but there are still little available data about these facilities. For batteries, Rydh and Sanden made a complete energy analysis review of different technologies.24,25 In a Li–Po battery, the common materials are shown in Fig. 4 and materials content provided by the manufacturer was detailed in Table 2.
 Fig. 4  Components in the Li–Po battery contained in the OPV lamp. 
The anode is generally made of 14 µm thick graphite coated on copper foil.26 The embodied energy in the anode materials was found to be 160 MJ kg−1 of graphite27 and 52 MJ kg−1 of copper foil.28 The diaphragm is made of equal proportions of polypropylene and polyethylene.
These polymers are materials easily found in the PlasticsEurope database23 with energy requirements of 73.37 and 78.08 MJ kg−1 respectively. Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) is the most widely used salt in the electrolytes for these kinds of batteries. LCA data for lithium and the other ingredients (ethylene, and propylene) were found. However, the LCA data of LiPF6 were not available in the literature and neither in the Ecoinvent database29 Therefore, the electrolyte has been modelled on the basis of its chemical synthesis with respect to industrial production requirements in terms of materials, energy, and catalysts, as shown in Table 5.PCL5 + 6LiF → 5LiCl + LiPF6

The cathode is made of lithium cobaltite (LiCoO2). The manufacturing process for the cathode salt needs energy for oxidation of pure CoCl2 in a precise controlled furnace in which cobalt oxide (Co3O4) is produced. The cobalt oxide is then mixed with lithium containing compounds and transformed into LiCoO2. Assuming the calculations of Zackrisson et al., a total of 3 kJ electricity are needed per gram of LiCoO2 produced.30
For other components of the battery, valuable information for aluminium packaging was obtained from the manufacturer (Amcor) and from the PlasticsEurope database.23 The energy requirements for plastics and nickel were obtained from Norgate and Rankin.31 This leads us to a material and energy inventory for the battery which is shown in Table 6.

3.2.2.4. Light emitting diode. 
Regarding the materials and the processes in manufacturing of opto-semiconductor devices, there is limited information. A detailed inventory of materials such as: gallium nitride—and its starters: trimethyl gallium, ammonia precursors, high purity gases—sapphire substrate and silicon, was not available; we have based our calculations, for energy needed in the production of the materials, on data from OSRAM: 0.41 kW h of primary energy are required per LED product.32 The manufacture of LEDs consists mainly in the steps shown in the frontend and backend processes as illustrated in Fig. 5. Including CVD, metal deposition, photolithography, etching and cleaning steps. The energy in the manufacturing is ∼30 kW h of primary energy per wafer (1000 LEDs),33 but there are no data available for bonding wafers, or laser lift-off, and neither for mounting, testing, packaging, phosphor coating or encapsulation processes. The energy requirements for the rest of processes are listed in Table 7, giving a total embodied energy of 1.48 MJ from which 1.17 MJ are embodied in the materials, 0.31 MJ in direct process, and the energy required for transport of the LED from the manufacturing place to Denmark is 8.21 kJ EPE.

3.2.2.5. Electronic board. 
An electronic circuitry comprising silver was printed on top of a PET membrane followed by semiautomatic mounting of discrete components to complete every lamp. These components such as blocking diode, white LED and a battery were mounted after the printing on the back side, using a fully automated SMD (surface mount device) process line with a consumption of 5.2 kW h per 256 lamps at Mekoprint Electronics A/S. After component assembly the lamps were laminated and laser cut into individual lamps as shown in Fig. 6. In Table 8 we have summarized the material inventory for the electronic board. For simplicity we have considered the same manufacturing energy input for both LED and blocking diode. For the copper tape and the metal dome made in stainless steel and gold, we used the values proposed by Norgate and Rankin et al.31 on behalf of gross energy requirement for their production.

3.2.3. Operational phase. 
There is no external source of energy supply in the operational phase. Since the OPV application has no mobile parts and all the components except the batteries have long term guarantees, the maintenance and repairing energy can be neglected.


3.2.4. Decommissioning phase. 
At the end of the life-cycle, the solar PV system generates a substantial amount of waste. Up to 60 elements can be found in complex electric and electronic equipments (EEE), the lithium battery contains only some milligrams of cobalt, but the large amount of EEE represents an enormous metal resource that could become available when devices have reached their end-of-life. In EU and USA there exist some plants for recycling spent batteries, but in developing countries the collection and recycling are usually much lower.
In the field of organic solar cells there is no previous experience in recycling procedures, although some attempts have been made for producing biodegradable solar cells.34 Until this comes to the market, or a recycling system is established, it is assumed that the solar PV lamp would be land filled and no recycling processes are considered either for the electronic subcomponents or the solar cell itself.

3.3. Life-cycle GHG emissions
The CO2 emissions due to the production of the PV lighting product can be obtained by multiplying all energy and material inputs by their corresponding emission factors. For PV modules, electronic devices and battery production, the emission factor, we assumed, was based on the fuel mix of Denmark in 2009,35 where about 48% of the electricity was produced by coal-plants, 20% by natural gas plants, 20% by wind-farms, 3% by fuel plants and 9% by other plants. For this electricity system, the CO2-emission factor is 420 g per kW h produced electricity.
Finally, the total calculated embodied CO2 plotted in Fig. 7 is 0.39 kg per lamp. The emissions due to manufacture of the raw materials account in the OPV for 77%, while in the battery the value is 66% and thus slightly lower. The results show that emissions due to the transportation have the highest value in the OPV. This can be explained because it contains a great number of components and the majority are manufactured in East Asia. On the other hand the emissions in the LED from the transport can be almost neglected because of the low weight of the product that allows cheap transport in terms of energy (and obviously cost).

3.4. EPBT analysis of the OPV product
As a result of the life-cycle study a total embodied energy of 9.55 MJ in gross energy is estimated for the lamp assembly. Fig. 8 summarizes the values obtained in this study for the energy requirements in the production of each component per OPV lamp. The energy embodied in materials, in direct process and in transport is shown independently. According to the values shown in previous tables, almost 80% of the total energy needed for the lamp, i.e. 7.50 MJ, is embedded in the materials, 1.83 MJ is accounting for direct process energy and 0.60 MJ is the energy consumed in transportation.
 Fig. 8  Share of energy embodied in the materials production, in direct process energy and in transport in an OPV lamp. 
When looking at the share of the energy used for components and process for manufacturing the lamp depicted in Fig. 9, the solar cells are responsible for the 41% (4.10 MJ) of the entire energy, followed by the electronic board and the protective layers, both around 18% each (1.73 MJ and 1.70 MJ, respectively). Production of materials, processing and transport of the LED contribute 15% (1.48 MJ) to the energy requirements, and the battery accounts for just 5% (0.46 MJ) in the manufacturing phase. The assembly of the components takes 2% (0.21 MJ) of the embodied energy.
 Fig. 9  The energy input in the manufacturing of the OPV lamp including energy embedded in the materials, in direct process energy and transport per component. 
In Fig. 10 the share of energy requirement for each material is shown, without taking transport into account. It is clear that ITO is the more consuming material accounting for around 35% of the energy. This was in some way expected since in an OPV, the ITO accounts for 87% of the embodied energy.9 More interesting is the large amount of energy consumed in the protective layers (PET film) and in both LED and blocking diode that accounts for 22% and 15% respectively. It is not surprising in the case of the PET, since it is a material which basically constitutes most of the lamp by weight (67% of the weight). But the manufacturing of the LEDs as has been described is still very energy-intensive at least for their use in small devices where the performance is very low.
 Fig. 10  Share for embodied energy in the materials for manufacturing an OPV lamp. 
The energy payback time (EPBT) is defined as the ratio of embodied energy, converted to electrical energy, to the annual electrical production. (1)
Hence, and assuming a best thermoelectric efficiency of ηth-el of 35%, the estimated embodied energy for the OPV lamp is equivalent to 178 W hel. The OPV device must supply a load, which follows a daily constant pattern of 3 hours per day leading to a daily average energy consumption of 255 mWh. This means that the annual electrical production is 93 W hel per year. According to eqn (1), an EPBT of 9.98 years is obtained for the lamp. Therefore, the OPV device will generate less energy than the energy embodied in it by the end of its life-time (estimated in 2 years).
The amount of 0.41 kg of embodied CO2 for the given OPV lamp has been calculated in the life-cycle GHG emissions study. The electricity generated by the OPV device in its life-time can be estimated to be 186 W hel. Another significant parameter for any electricity generating technology is the CO2 emission factor (equivalent CO2 emissions per kW h of generated electricity). It is calculated as the total CO2 emissions due to the embodied energy of the module (embodied CO2) divided by the total generated electricity by the module during its life-time. For this OPV device the CO2 emission factor is about 2.18 g per W hel.
3.5. Comparison with other portable power products
The environmental impacts of the OPV lamp can only be evaluated properly by comparing it to other alternative options, because avoided emissions depend on the electricity, or lighting supply in this case, which the OPV lamp would be replacing. In order to compare the lamp with another light source, the energy embedded in the OPV system, EEMB, during its lifetime, L; and the energy “saved” during each year of operation, Eavoided (eqn (2), both in primary energy). That is the energy that is saved every year by not using the alternative to the OPV lamp. Several scenarios are then used for this comparison, we have in the following considered four alternatives for lighting devices and listed the details in Table 9. (2)

Case 1: kerosene light. 
The fuel consumption of a typical kerosene lamp is between 0.02 and 0.05 L h−1 and the emission factor is considered 0.123 kg of CO2 per h,36 delivering a lighting strength of 45 lumens. The energy consumption in the kerosene production was found to be 2350 kJ kg−1 calculated using the energy requirements for its production from the literature.37,38


Case 2: small PV lighting system. 
This product is powered by a 0.7 Wpa-Si solar panel. Two NiCd 2000 mA h AA-type batteries store the harvested solar energy and deliver electricity to a light system when night falls at the end of the day. The lighting system comprises 6 LEDs, delivering a total of 7 lumens. It is assumed that the LEDs have a life-time of 20000 hours of operation. Maximum daily operation time is 3.5 hours. The life-time of entire product is considered to be 10 years.



            Case 3: small torch lighting system. 
This system is a torch in which the electricity is stored in a 4.5 Ah battery. Light is delivered by a 7 W compact fluorescent light bulb (CFL) of 150 lumens. It is assumed that the CFL has a lifetime of 10000 hours of operation. And the batteries have a lifetime of 3.5 years. The life-time of the other components is considered to be 10 years.



            Case 4: battery charging station. 
In some remote rural places the possibility to recharge a lead acid battery from a diesel generator is well explored. The system typically comprises a diesel engine, assumed to have a nominal power of 5 kVA, an efficiency of 80% and an average factor of use of 10% for the purpose of feeding a lighting service.
Firstly, the OPV lamp would be used in a remote area as a replacement for a kerosene lamp. We have chosen Ethiopia where excellent solar conditions exist, well above 2000 kW h m−2y−1.42 Ethiopia would thus be an excellent place to make use of a solar powered lamp since most of the inhabitants live in rural areas (85%) and where the average electrification rate is only 1%.43 As a result, Ethiopians experience numerous limitations at night-time. Once the sun sets between 6 and 7 o'clock, the only source of light in most parts of rural Ethiopia is a dim kerosene lamp producing health-hazardous smoke and presents a significant fire hazard. Therefore, the substitution of the poor kerosene lamps with solar powered LED lights could not only solve lighting needs, but would also provide environmental, social and economical benefits.
An EPBT of 0.12 years is obtained, when a kerosene lamp is substituted by the OPV lamp, meaning that the OPV device would need to operate just 1.46 months in order to earn back its invested energy. In case the OPV lamp replaces a lead acid battery powered torch or a battery charging station as light supply, it will require only 0.05 or 0.07 years of operation, respectively. All EPBTs are shown in Fig. 11. In Table 9, all the emission factors for the lanterns or systems are also shown. Despite the fact that the torch and the BCS are the most energy intensive systems, the emission factors are not so high because they are used in combination with a CFL bulb of 7 W. For a diesel generator the considered emissions are 1.27 kg of CO2 per kW hel.36 This figure includes emissions during fuel combustion, the fuel extraction and refining, manufacturing of the generator itself and fuel transport (over 100 km). And 2.56 kg CO2 eq per litre of kerosene have been estimated from the literature.37
 Fig. 11  Energy pay-back times obtained when switching to an OPV lamp from different lighting systems. 
Finally, by proceeding similarly to the way EPBT is estimated, we obtain a CO2 pay-back time or greenhouse gas pay-back time (GPBT) as the ratio of the total embodied CO2 in the OPV lamp, to the total avoided CO2 emissions. In terms of avoided CO2 emission a GPBT of 0.13 years is obtained when comparing the OPV based lamp to a silicon based PV lamp, whereas the comparison of the OPV lamp with a kerosene lamp yields a GPBT of 1.5 days (0.004 years). In the case where an OPV lamp replaces a non-rechargeable battery or a battery charging station as light supply, 0.025 or 0.011 years of operation will be required, respectively (Fig. 12).
 Fig. 12  Greenhouse-gas Pay-Back Time for the OPV lamp in comparison with other lighting products. 
Approximately 109 kg of CO2 will be saved in the case where a kerosene lamp is replaced by BCS, 115 kg if it is substituted by a non rechargeable lamp, 121 kg if it is substituted by a PV silicon battery lamp, or 124 kg by switching to an OPV lamp. The contribution of the solar cell to the embodied CO2 emissions in the two evaluated PV lamps ranges from 41% in the case of the OPV lamp to 15% for the PV silicon lamp. The emissions produced during the usage phase represent around 80% for a kerosene lamp and accounts for 42% if a Battery Charging Station is operated instead (Fig. 13).

4. Conclusions
We have performed a life-cycle analysis of a product that integrates a polymer solar cell module. Even though organic photovoltaics is not a mature technology, it has been proven that it can be integrated into a lamp and act as a sustainable source of light in conjunction with a light emitting diode and a battery. The required energy for manufacturing the OPV lamp is 9.56 MJ per unit and this is the lowest value when comparing with other PV technology lanterns or traditional torches based on different batteries.
The EPBT for the OPV based lamp in this study is around 10 years. It should be noted that this factor is probably over estimated since the use of OPVs is below the potential for the technology. It has not been designed for earn-back of the energy involved in its manufacturing, but for providing a service causing significantly less damage to the environment. An OPV lamp in substitution of a kerosene lamp would need to operate just 44 days to recuperate the energy invested. The comparison with a kerosene lamp also showed that while the OPV lamp experiences its emission release during the production of the product, the kerosene lamp does this during its entire life-cycle, deferring its emissions to the future and distributing them, raising indoor air pollution in households and creates a fire hazard. From an environmental point of view, the change to an OPV lamp as a reading light system could provide ancillary health benefits, with as little as just 1.5 days for earn-back of the emissions generated during the manufacturing.

Broader context

Polymer solar cells have been researched broadly in the past decade and are progressing towards large scale manufacture, commercialization and product integration. Most reports present somewhat unrealistic views on the capacity of the technology which must be viewed as marginal compared to existing solar cell technologies. In contrast to most other solar cell technologies polymer solar cells ideally do not present an abundance problem and it is currently the only solar cell technology with manufacturing schemes fast enough to reach production levels of a gigawatt-a-day. Recent efforts have analyzed the impact that polymer solar cell production has on the environment through life cycle analysis. Of the few reports available only one report was based on real production data showing energy payback times similar to the 2 year service life. In this work we address the impact on the energy payback time when this inferior but highly adaptable technology is integrated into products in the form of lighting solutions for developing countries and find energy payback times on the order of 10 years which is significantly longer than the service life. When exchanging existing lighting solutions with the polymer solar cell based lighting solutions energy payback times on the order of 1–2 months are obtained.
