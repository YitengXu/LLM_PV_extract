    , Accepted 17th October 2019First published on 24th October 2019AbstractThe purpose of this paper was to examine the effect of microbial fuel cells coupled with solar cells (MFC-SCs). In this study, MFC-SCs were constructed to understand the role of intermittent illumination in electricity generation and sediment remediation based on the sediment microbial fuel cell scenario. Furthermore, the microbial community structure on the anode in the sediment was probed using high-throughput sequencing. We identified that SCs with natural intermittent illumination (12 h per day) can promote the electricity production and nutrient utilization of the sediment of MFCs to the greatest extent, which can help manage solar energy utilization for environmental conversion and control the eutrophication of water bodies.The removal rates of NH3–N, NO3–N, organic matter and TP by the MFC-SC were 46.23% ± 1.06%, 41.50% ± 3.80%, 23.20% ± 1.40% and 24.40 ± 5.50%; in contrast, those of the traditional MFC were 25.10% ± 2.40%, 18.70% ± 4.10%, 14.10% ± 0.90% and 13.00% ± 2.50%, respectively. Meanwhile, the treatment groups in MFC-SCs influenced the species components and microflora structure. The 6329 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the control group without solar cells outnumbered those of the treatments of 24 h MFC-SC (5676), 12 h MFC-SC (5664) and 3 h MFC-SC (5592). This can advance the enrichment of dominant bacteria; meanwhile, the microbial process and the mechanisms behind it require further study. These results indicate that MFC-SCs provide a comprehensive method of solar energy utilization and environment remediation.

Environmental significance
Sediment is the origin of contaminants and collects pollutants. Polluted sediment gathered at the bottom of rivers is hazardous to aquatic environments and to human health. Exploring environmentally friendly and economic remediation techniques for polluted sediment is necessary. A microbial fuel cell coupled with a solar cell (MFC-SC) was used to remediate actual contaminated sediments. The results of this work demonstrate that natural intermittent illumination (12 h per day) can promote biodegradation of pollutants and electricity production simultaneously. Furthermore, the effects of intermittent illumination were analyzed from the perspective of microorganisms. This study provides evidence of the benefits of solar energy utilization, which will aid the popularisation and application of this technology.

1. Introduction
Sediment is a sink for various contaminants, such as heavy metals, organic chemicals and nutrients.1 The contamination of sediments poses a threat to aquatic ecosystems and has adverse effects on human health. MFCs can convert chemical energy contained in organic compounds into electricity as a renewable and potential future clean energy source.2 This charge generation process can be expressed briefly by the following equation (eqn (1)):3 (1)
MFCs have been used for energy generation and pollution remediation. For example, sediment microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) have been used as power sources for instruments to monitor marine or remote lake environments for a long time.4,5 The merge of an MFC and a Fered-Fenton reactor recovered sustainable energy from sewage sludge, and more than 75% of the VSS was removed.6 Some industrial effluents such as those from rice mills and starch-processing plants as well as some refractory organics can be purified by MFCs.7,8 However, many factors influence the performance of MFCs, including the type and moisture content of organic matter in the anode,9–11 the native microorganisms and microflora, the anode electrode materials, the distance between the anode and cathode, the reactor type and the external resistance.12–16 The structure and relative species abundance of the microflora is one of the most important parameters. Many electrochemical bacteria17–19 have been discovered. These bacteria mainly belong to the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria.20 Power generation and remediation efficiency have direct relationships with the exoelectrogens.
Research on improving MFC performance has been conducted to expand their range of application.12,21 Combining other technologies with MFC systems has been proven to increase practicability. For example, some researchers added wetland plants to a SMFC and constructed a P-SMFC system, in which the wetland plants supply organic matter to maintain steady SMFC operation.22–24 Some researchers designed photoelectrocatalytic microbial fuel cells (PEC-MFCs) to degrade pollutants.7 Additionally, solar cells (SCs) are stable and inexpensive devices which can transform solar energy into electric energy. Combining SCs with MFCs was realized in previous studies.25–27 The introduction of a SC under light irradiation maximizes the ability of the anode to provide electrons to the MFC.28 However, solar illumination is intermittent in reality. The effects of MFC-SCs under intermittent illumination on sediment remediation remain unclear.
In this study, a MFC-SC system was constructed with a 1 V SC module cascaded into an MFC. The electric field was altered by changing the illumination duration of the SC and determining the effects between the SC and MFC from the perspectives of performance and microbial community structure. We tested the power density, output voltage and removal efficiency of contaminants in the sediment. We identified that the treatment groups with SCs of different suitable intermittent illumination durations can promote sediment remediation and produce electricity simultaneously. This study will be helpful in exploring the electrical characteristics of microbial fuel cells modified by SCs on sediment and will provide evidence of beneficial solar energy utilization for the popularisation and application of the technology.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 MFC-SC construction and operation
The MFC-SC system was mainly assembled from a double-chamber Plexiglas reactor, an anode, a cathode and an SC. The anode chamber was air-tight, whilst the cathode chamber was open. A small hole of 0.5 mm was opened in the anode chamber cover to collect greenhouse gas and connect with the Plexiglas nozzle. The Plexiglas nozzle was connected to the vacuum gas collecting bag by a latex tube, and the gas leakage treatment was performed with Vaseline. The volume of both chambers, which were connected by a channel and separated by a piece of proton exchange membrane, was 500 mL. The anode chamber was filled with black odour river sediment which was sampled from Suishi Ferry, Pearl River Branch (Guangzhou, China). The sediment constituents are as follows: NH3–N, 62.24 g kg−1; NO3–N, 48.52 mg kg−1; organic matter, 39.26 g kg−1; total P, 0.82 g kg−1; and water holdup, 68.53%.29 The cathode chamber was filled with 50 mM potassium ferricyanide solution, which acted as an electron acceptor. The electrode material was carbon felt, and the size was 8 cm × 5 cm × 5 mm. The materials were remodified to ensure efficiency.30 The SC was inserted into the MFC-SC system. In this study, an incandescent light (60 W) above the enclosed container (40 cm × 40 cm × 50 cm) was used to enable the bottom SCs to function steadily. In this way, sunlight was imitated and reinforced, and the illuminating intensity reached 37.5 mW cm−2. An SC was attached to the MFC system with Cu wires to form the MFC-SC system. In this association system, a 1000 Ω resistor was inserted to protect the circuit. A data acquisition system was inserted above the resistor to measure the open-circuit voltage and closed-circuit voltage, as follows (Fig. 1):
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the SC-SMFC system. 
2.2 Measurement and analyses
Before the operation, 200 mL of 1.0 g L−1 glucose solution and 300 mL of eutrophic sediment were filled in the anode chamber. At the same time, 500 mL of potassium ferricyanide solution was filled in the cathode chamber. Various microorganisms exist in the sediment, and the glucose solution can provide nutrient substance for microorganisms. To stimulate the formation of a microbial membrane on the anode surface, we replaced the glucose solution in the anode and the potassium ferricyanide solution in the cathode in batches every week. The MFC system was initiated successfully after the fourth replacement, when the output voltages after the third and fourth replacements were both 0.45 V. Then, the mixture of glucose solution and sediment was replaced with 500 mL of polluted black odour river sediment, which was treated as the electron donor in the anode chamber. Meanwhile, 500 mL of 50 mM potassium ferricyanide solution was refreshed as an electron acceptor in the cathode chamber. At the same time, the MFC-SC systems were constructed by cascading a 1 V SC into each circuit. The working time of an SC can be controlled by changing the light irradiation time. Three treatment groups were set with 3 h of illumination from 12:00 to 15:00 (3 h MFC-SC), 12 h of illumination from 0:00 to 12:00 (12 h MFC-SC) and 24 h of illumination (24 h MFC-SC). The control group was a single MFC without a SC. Each group contained three parallel samples; S1, S2 and S3 were subjected to 3 h of illumination of the MFC-SC; S4, S5 and S6 were subjected to 12 h of illumination of the MFC-SC; S7, S8 and S9 were subjected to 24 h of illumination of the MFC-SC; and S10, S11 and S12 were chosen as the control group.

2.2.1 Electricity generation monitoring. 
A data acquisition system (Keithley Instruments, USA) was connected between the two ends of the resistor to monitor the electricity generation performance; this system was connected with a personal computer to store the collected information. During the monitoring period, the time interval for data acquisition was 20 min. Current–voltage curves were tested utilising a resistance box in the range from 1 Ù to 99999 Ù. Given that the voltages from the data acquisition system were obtained, and the protective resistance was fixed (1000 Ù), the circuit current was calculated based on Ohm's law, that is, I = U/R, where U is the voltage and R is the resistance. The internal resistance of the MFC was obtained through the polarisation curves. The internal resistance was divided into active, Ohm and concentration polarisation areas. When the maximum output power density appeared in the Ohm polarisation area, the corresponding external resistance was equal to the inner resistance of the MFC. We can compute the inner resistance from the slope of the current–voltage curve.


2.2.2 Polluted sediment characteristics. 
In this research, the parameters of NH3–N, NO3–N, organic matter and TP were measured with regular soil analysis methods.29


2.2.3 Microbial community analysis. 
At the end of the MFC-SC run, anode carbon felt samples were obtained from the anode chamber and were cleaned several times to remove oily impurities and some nonelectricigens. The anode carbon felts were cut into pieces with sterilised scissors, and the DNA of the microorganisms attached on the anode felt surface was extracted. The samples were used as templates for specific PCR amplification using the primer pairs 338F (5′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′). The microbial community between the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and the relative abundance of species at the phylum level were detected and analysed using high-throughput sequencing.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Power generation using MFC-SCs
Microorganisms will grow rapidly if sufficient nutrients are supplied. In the anode chamber of a MFC, the microorganisms digest organic pollutants to promote cell proliferation. A biofilm is formed on the anode by gathering microorganisms; this requires approximately 28 days. The four sets of production units had similar initial outputs, thereby indicating that the same microorganism conditions were suitable for degrading pollutants. The output voltage of the treatment group was nearly 1 V under illumination at 0 h and then decreased gradually with decreasing organic pollutants, as shown in Fig. 2a. The performance of the 12 h MFC-SC (0.5 ± 0.1 V), followed by the 3 h MFC-SC and 24 h MFC-SC, was superior to that of the MFC (0.25 ± 0.1 V). The better performance with the SC indicates that MFC-SCs can be operated; this demonstrates that electricity-generating bacteria under suitable electrical stimulation on the anode can be acclimated and cultivated and are suitable for electricity generation. The detailed tendency of output voltage for 24 h is shown in Fig. 2b. In the MFC system, the output voltage decreased slowly, and the values varied from 0.1 V to 0.36 V. However, the voltage outputs of the 3 h MFC-SC and 12 h MFC-SC varied in a broad range because of the additional SCs. The 24 h MFC-SC showed a high value for a long time until the substrate concentration could not support microbial survival. The presence of a SC changed the output voltage. This phenomenon is equivalent to the introduction of an additional electric source when a SC is introduced into a MFC system. The electrons generated by the anode will flow into the cathode through an external circuit for the 3h MFC-SC at the 12th h, whilst protons run into the cathode through an exchange membrane. This process will be accelerated with the cooperation of an electric source. Hence, the voltage increased. The additional electric source disappeared after 3 h. The balance of the potential difference was broken once the SCs stopped working. At the same time, many charged particles were present in the anode chambers; thus, a potential difference appeared, which caused the anode to change from positive potential to negative potential. The change range narrowed as the reaction progressed. Similarly, the additional electric source disappeared for the 12 h MFC-SC at the 12th h, which dropped the voltage below zero.

To evaluate the effects of the SCs, we tested the polarisation curves and power densities of the MFCs when the systems were steady. We removed the SCs from the MFC-SC systems after 13 days of operation. The maximum power density and internal resistance were calculated. Fig. 3 shows that the different illumination durations affected the polarisation behaviour and power production of the MFC-SCs. The maximum power densities of the 3 h MFC-SC, 12 h MFC-SC, 24 h MFC-SC and MFC were 5.08, 5.80, 3.68 and 6.30 mW m−2, respectively. The internal ohmic resistances of these samples were 2566, 2211, 2605 and 2105 Ω, respectively. The power density of the 12 h MFC-SC (5.8 mW m−2) was the highest compared with the other treatment groups. This result suggests that suitable electrical stimulation is important for the power generation and for the activity of electricity-generating bacteria. This is similar to the results of Chen et al. and Sun et al. Chen et al. found that a low external DC electric source with a MFC can improve the performance of the MFC, and a high DC electric source destroys the electrochemical performance of MFC.31 Sun et al. found that the electric source can control the activity of the electrobiofilm; a negative electric source of 2 V inhibits the catalytic oxidation activity of the biofilm, whilst a negative electric source of 5 V enhances this oxidation activity.32 We also found that the output power densities of the treatment groups with the influence of extra SCs were lower than those of the controls, and the internal resistances of the treatment groups were higher. We infer that the fast reactions of the MFC-SCs due to the external SC will exhaust the organic pollutants that provide nutrition to the microorganisms in the MFC. A study reported that the introduction of photocatalysis improves the ability of the cathode to accept electrons and the ability of the anode to provide maximal electrons.27,33 For example, researchers found that a new tandem system of a MFC with a SSC could provide a higher power output.27,34 Under illumination, the open circuit voltage and maximum output power density of the new MFC system were significantly improved compared with those of a conventional MFC system.35 Sun et al. found that a photocatalytic battery connected with a microbial fuel cell could produce a voltage of 0.7 V, which provides an energy reaction barrier for the circuit and achieves H production in the cathode.36 The amount of organic pollutants utilised as nutrition for the microorganisms was greater than that in the control groups before testing the polarisation on the basis of the output voltage. In general, these experimental results are extremely useful in practice and show the possibility of the application of MFC-SCs with suitable and discontinuous duration of illumination.

3.2 Effects on sediment pollutant remediation
A MFC is a device that can disintegrate organic matter and other pollutants to produce electricity. In this process, the MFC not only recycles energy from waste but also removes contaminants to clean the environment. Organic matter, TP, NH3–N and NO3–N were detected at the end of the operation. The removal efficiencies with different illumination times were analysed.
The continuous movement of electrons can format current and electrons from decomposed organic matter. The removal efficiency of pollutants in the sediment can be estimated through the quantity of electrons produced. The quantity can be calculated using eqn (2). The results are as follows: Q12 h MFC-SC (680.6844C) > Q24 h MFC-SC (642.5222C) > Q3 h MFC-SC (533.8188C) > Q MFC (436.77C). The electricity of the 12 h MFC-SC group reached a peak, and the 24 h MFC-SC was the lowest among the four groups. The electricity quantities of the treatment groups were larger than those of the control. This conclusion was confirmed by the detailed pollutant removal data. (2)

Fig. 4 shows that the organic matter content in the anode chamber decreased significantly at the end. In the experiments, the organic matter removal rates of the 3 h MFC-SC, 12 h MFC-SC and 24 h MFC-SC were 15.9 ± 1.7%, 23.2 ± 1.4% and 19.3 ± 1.9%, respectively, which are higher than that of the control group (14.1 ± 0.9%). This result also indicates great enhancement of the anodic oxidation efficiency with the SC. This is similar to the results for a MFC–SSC (microbial fuel cell-silicon solar cell), which were not a simple summation of the MFC and SSC. Only by cooperation with the anodic microorganisms could rapid electron transfer be realized.25–27 The differences between the two groups were significant. The results indicated that the microorganisms adsorbed on the anode carbon felt surface could decompose organic pollutants. The organics were dissolved firstly into small molecules, mainly by the processes of oxygenolysis and hydrolysis. These tiny molecules can be used as energy and C sources in microbial metabolism. In this reaction, protons and electrons were produced. The protons and electrons transferred from the anode to cathode differently in the following ways: electrons flowed through the external circuit, whilst protons flowed through the proton exchange membrane. Some research has shown that electrical stimulation can change cell growth. Electrical stimulation can also enhance enzyme secretion and shorten the mitotic cycle by promoting the metabolism process in a low electric field. Ding et al. found that electron–hole pairs were produced and a directional electric field was formed when SCs were exposed to illumination, and the presence of the electric field promoted the decomposition of organic matter in the anode chamber.27 Hence, with the enhancement of light irrigation from 3 h to 12 h, the nutrients were utilized better because of the electric field. However, at high voltage, electrical stimulation inhibits cell growth and even leads to cell mortality.37–39 This may prevent the microorganisms from using the nutrients from 12 h to 24 h of illumination time. The illumination time, apparently, will influence the organic matter removal rate, and introducing SCs has a positive effect on organic matter degradation in SC-SMFC systems.
 Fig. 4  The changes in concentration of the final sediment indices in the MFCs. (a) Organic content at different reactor. (b) Total phosphorus at different reactor. (c) Ammonia nitrogen at different reactor. (d) Nitrate nitrogen at different reactor. 
An excess amount of N in water is the primary cause of eutrophication. Removing the N contents from sediment and its overlying water is crucial for the remediation of eutrophicated water bodies. The main mechanisms of N migration and transformation include nitration, denitrification, anammox, organic N mineralisation, and absorption and release by microorganisms. At the end of the operation, the NH3–N and NO3–N contents were tested, and the results are shown in Fig. 4c and (d), respectively. The maximum removal rate of NH3–N was highest in the 12 h MFC-SC (46.23% ± 1.06%), followed by the 3 h MFC-SC (28.4% ± 1.4%) and 24 h MFC-SC (35.3% ± 3.2%), compared with the MFC group (25.1 ± 2.4%). Meanwhile, the maximum removal rate of NO3–N reached 41.5% ± 3.8% with 3 h of illumination. The maximum removal rates of the two other treatment groups were 26.4% ± 5.4% and 31.9 ± 4.3%, which were higher than that of the control (18.7% ± 4.1%). Employing exoelectrogens as anodic bio-catalysts can oxidize organics.40 Ammonium may contribute to electricity generation in MFCs in two ways. First, because ammonium-N is in its lowest oxidation state, it can supply electrons via its oxidation; second, ammonium-N is transformed into to nitrate nitrogen when it is used as an electron donor through nitrification.41 The SC-MFC system is demonstrated to accelerate electron transfer in the anode chamber, which promotes the nitrification and oxidization process in the anode cell. Hence, the efficiency of the treatment groups was higher.
Nitrate removal in a MFC-SC can be realized via heterotrophic denitrification as the electron acceptor in the anode.42,43 NO3–N will be converted into N2 gas and some N2O. It is speculated that the rate of nitrate removal is positively related to the NH3–N content.
The TP also decreased while the system was running, and the removal rates are shown in Fig. 4(b). The removal rates of the 3 h MFC-SC, 12 h MFC-SC and 24 h MFC-SC were 16.3 ± 2.5%, 24.4 ± 5.5% and 18.3 ± 3.2%, respectively, which were higher than that of the control (13.0 ± 2.5%). The differences between the two groups were significant. The total P was mainly removed in two ways. Firstly, some organic P in the sediment was transformed into gaseous phosphine and then spilled off. Secondly, P around the anode carbon felts will be absorbed by microbes to meet their demands of growth and reproduction. Phosphorus may function as an anodic fuel in MFCs, supplying electrons via its oxidation. With the fast electron transport in the MFC-SC system, the removal rates can be improved.
The better the microbial growth, the higher the efficiency of nutrient use. Suitable electrical stimulation aids the activity of electricity-generating bacteria, while excessive stimulation inhibits the normal metabolism of some microbial microorganisms.44 It was speculated that the 3 h MFC-SC and 12 h MFC-SC would show positive electricity-generating activity and that the 24 h MFC-SC may inhibit the electricity-generating activity.45,46 Hence, the different treatment groups have different removal rates.
Overall, the organic matter, NH3–N, NO3–N and total P contents in the sediment decreased significantly after the systems were run for approximately 28 days. The removal rates of organic matter, NH3–N and total P reached their peaks when the SCs worked for 12 h, followed by lighting for 24 h. NO3–N reached the maximum removal rate with 3 h of illumination. The MFC-SCs performed more effectively in remediating sediment contaminants than the controls. Hence, the added electric field can improve sediment remediation. Different illumination times exhibited different influences on contaminant removal. The removal rates of the 12 h MFC-SC was ideal.
3.3 Influence on the microbial community

3.3.1 Analysis of OTUs and biodiversity. 
Anode carbon felts were obtained to analyse the biodiversity of the microorganisms attached on the felts by high-throughput sequencing after pretreatment, DNA extraction and PCR amplification. Among the 199774 sequences in the test, only 71181 were valid. The OTUs with 97% sequence similarity were generally regarded as a species. The OTUs of the treatment and control groups were averaged. As shown in Table 1, the results were in the following order: MFC (6329) > 24 h MFC-SC (5676) > 12 h MFC-SC (5664) > 3 h MFC-SC (5592). This result indicated that the quantity of OTUs in the control group was significantly higher than in the treatment groups (p < 0.05). The quantities of OTUs were different among the treatment groups, but the changes were insignificant (p > 0.05); this suggests that the different illumination times had different influences on the microbial community. Based on the OTUs in all samples, the Shannon indices were calculated to show the alpha diversity of each sample (Table 2). The Shannon index of each sample ranged from 10.4 to 10.7, and statistical analysis showed that there was no significant relationship between the samples (p > 0.05). The number of species in the community decreased, indicating that the species in the samples were not as rich. Some microorganisms are eliminated by the new environment. This can advance the enrichment of dominant bacteria, combining electricity production with the oxidation of organic matter as discussed above. This result is mainly due to the fact that certain microorganisms, such as Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes, cannot survive well within the electric field in this study. Aelterman et al. noted that an anode potential of −200 mV versus Ag/AgCl generally has the highest respiration rate and current generation, whilst −400 mV has the lowest rate and biomass quantity.47 This result indicates that some bacteria may have been inactivated or even killed when the environment was changed. The microbial process and the mechanisms behind it require further study.

S1, S4, S7 and S10 from the 12 groups were chosen as representatives for the treatment and control groups. Some differences in the microbial communities among the samples were clearly observed after the Venn diagram of the OTUs was drawn (Fig. 5). A total of 815 species were found in all four samples. This value was much lower than the exclusive species in S1 (2190), S4 (2244), S7 (2051) and S10 (2066). This result proves that the addition of SCs will influence the species components and the structure of the microflora attached to the anode carbon felt.

Bacteria are important exoelectrogenic organisms that can use varied organic compounds as C sources to produce electricity. Different illumination times in the MFC-SCs had strange effects on the microbial community structure. The observed species were affiliated to 10 phyla in the bacterial classification analysis (Fig. 6). These phyla included Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chlorob, Chloroflexi, Elusimicrobia, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae, OD1, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. At the phylum level, the primary microorganisms were Proteobacteria (41.8% to 50.26%), followed by Chloroflexi (13.2% to 15.55%) and Nitrospirae (10.23% to 15.43%). The proportion of Firmicutes (1.74% to 2.7%) was relatively small; Proteobacteria and Firmicutes are the two most crucial types of electroforming microorganisms that have been isolated.48 The differences among the treated groups should be indicated. For example, the relative abundances of Nitrospirae and OD1 were high in the MFC-SC systems, whilst that of Firmicutes was high in the MFC system. Fig. 7 shows the classification of bacteria at the genus level (relative abundance of <1%). The abundance of Geobacter sp. was the highest at the genus level. Geobacter sp. is electrogenically active and enhances the electricity production.49Pseudomonas also belongs to Proteobacteria and is a typical electrogenic bacterium. Its abundance reached 11.5%, 14.33% and 8.53% in the 24 h, 12 h and 3 h treatment groups, respectively; these percentages are higher than that in the control group. However, Clostridium sp. also has an important composition. Clostridium sp. belongs to Firmicutes and is also a typical electrogenic bacterium; however, its proportion in the treatment groups was lower than in the blank group. However, the combined application of SCs and MFCs can promote the growth of some electrogenic bacteria.

4. Conclusion
In this study, a new MFC-SC system was developed to promote electricity generation and pollutant degradation. The results showed that the removal efficiencies of organic matter, total P, NH3–N and NO3–N from the sediments in the treatment groups were higher than those in the control groups, especially in the MFC-SC under 12 h of natural illumination. Thus, it is identified that natural intermittent illumination (12 h per day) can promote biodegrading pollutants and electricity production simultaneously. The OTU and biodiversity results showed that the MFC-SC influenced the species components and microflora structures on the system anode. Different illumination times on the MFC-SC exhibited different effects. It can promote enrichment of the dominant bacteria. The electrons were generated by electrogenic bacteria, and the electron transfer rate could be improved by adding a SC, which was beneficial in effectively restoring the polluted sediment. Therefore, the combination of sustainable and environmental techniques may extend the application of individual devices, and understanding the effects between them may pave an avenue to obtaining clean energy.

Environmental significance
Sediment is the origin of contaminants and collects pollutants. Polluted sediment gathered at the bottom of rivers is hazardous to aquatic environments and to human health. Exploring environmentally friendly and economic remediation techniques for polluted sediment is necessary. A microbial fuel cell coupled with a solar cell (MFC-SC) was used to remediate actual contaminated sediments. The results of this work demonstrate that natural intermittent illumination (12 h per day) can promote biodegradation of pollutants and electricity production simultaneously. Furthermore, the effects of intermittent illumination were analyzed from the perspective of microorganisms. This study provides evidence of the benefits of solar energy utilization, which will aid the popularisation and application of this technology.
