ChinaReceived 9th May 2013, Accepted 25th July 2013First published on 31st July 2013Abstractg-C3N4/BiOBr composite photocatalysts have been synthesized in the presence of the reactable ionic liquid 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([C16mim]Br). The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and photocurrent analysis. During the reaction process, the ionic liquid [C16mim]Br acted as solvent, reactant, template and dispersing agent at the same time, leading the g-C3N4 to disperse well on the surface of the BiOBr flower-like microspheres. The photocatalytic ability of the as-prepared photocatalysts was evaluated using rhodamine B (RhB) as a target pollutant. The photocatalysts exhibited a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance in the degradation of RhB. The results of PL, EIS, and photocurrent tests indicated that g-C3N4 combined and dispersed well on the surface of BiOBr which facilitated electron–hole separation, and led to the increased photocatalytic activity. The optimal g-C3N4 content for the photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4/BiOBr composites was determined. Radical trap experiments certified that the hole was the main reactive species for the photocatalytic degradation of RhB. A possible mechanism of g-C3N4 for the enhancement of visible light performance was proposed.1. IntroductionPhotocatalysts used for removing environmental pollutants and converting solar energy have attracted more and more attention.1,2 The semiconductor TiO2 has been widely used in photocatalytic reactions and is considered to be a good photocatalyst.3 However, due to its wide band gap (3.2 eV), it can only exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet illumination, and the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of TiO2 is limited.4 Therefore, the development of photocatalysts working under visible light is indispensable. Many kinds of photocatalysts have been developed to degrade organic pollutants or split water under visible light irradiation, such as BiVO4,5 CdS,6 Ag3PO4,7 g-C3N4,8 AgNbO3,9 Bi2WO6,10 Bi2O3,11etc.Recently, much attention has been focused on a new type of semiconductor material, bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX, X = Cl, Br, I), owing to their potential photocatalysis application.12,13 Among these BiOX catalysts, BiOBr is of great research interest because it is an active and stable visible-light photocatalyst.14,15 Several methods have been developed to prepare BiOBr photocatalysts.14–20 However, its photocatalytic activity has been also limited by the high recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. So, many different materials have been used to couple with BiOBr in order to enhance its photocatalytic performance, such as graphene,21 Bi(OH)3,22 BiOI,23 ZnFe2O424 and Ag–AgBr,25 or with the noble metal Ag.26 The results indicated that modification with another material can enhance the photocatalytic activity of the pure BiOBr. Therefore, it can be expected that composite materials could further improve the photocatalytic activity of BiOBr.Polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) materials have attracted much attention in the field of photocatalysis because they are inexpensive, non-toxic and easy to prepare.27–29 They are composed of C and N with a narrow band gap energy of 2.7 eV.30,31 They can be used for photochemical splitting of water, solar energy conversion and to selectively oxidize environmental pollutants. However, the photocatalytic efficiency of pure g-C3N4 is limited due to the recombination of its photo-generated electron–hole pairs.32 Many methods have been used to develop the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4, such as regulating shape,33 doping with heteroatoms (B,34 S,35 P,36 Fe,37 Ag29 and Au38), and coupling with dyes or other materials like BiPO4,39 ZnO,40 TaON,41 Bi2WO6,42 graphene,43 and MWNTs.32 The results showed that the g-C3N4 can be used as an efficient cocatalyst to increase the photocatalytic activity of a semiconductor. Therefore, if a g-C3N4 modified BiOBr photocatalyst could be synthesised, the photocatalytic activity of the composite could be enhanced. Our group has previously reported flower-like hollow BiOBr microspheres synthesized through a solvothermal process in the presence of the reactable ionic liquid [C16mim]Br.14 The ionic liquid [C16mim]Br acted as solvent, reactant and template at the same time.Up to now, the controlled synthesis of a g-C3N4/BiOBr composite photocatalyst in ILs has not been reported in the literature, and it is also a challenge to find a facile one-step route to synthesize a g-C3N4/BiOBr composite in this ionic liquid system. Since g-C3N4 poorly disperses in aqueous solution, therefore, the introduction of an ionic liquid was necessary to make g-C3N4 disperse better. In this paper, g-C3N4/BiOBr composites have been synthesized through a facile one-pot ethanol-assisted solvothermal process in the presence of the reactable ionic liquid [C16mim]Br. During the reaction process, the ionic liquid [C16mim]Br acted as solvent, reactant, template and dispersing agent at the same time. The results demonstrated that g-C3N4/BiOBr composites remarkably enhanced the rhodamine B (RhB) photodegradation activity over the pure BiOBr under visible light irradiation. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and photocurrent analysis have been used to analyze the photocatalytic mechanism. The results indicated that g-C3N4 combined and dispersed well on the surface of BiOBr which facilitated electron–hole separation, and led to increased photocatalytic activity. The radical trap experiments showed that the hole was the main reactive species for the degradation of RhB. A possible mechanism of g-C3N4 for the enhancement of visible light performance was also proposed.2. Experimental2.1. Material and sample preparationAll chemicals were analytical grade and used without further purification. The ionic liquid [C16mim]Br (1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide) (99%) was purchased from Shanghai Chengjie Chemical Co. Ltd.2.2. Synthesis of graphitic C3N4The metal-free g-C3N4 powders were synthesized by thermal polycondensation of dicyandiamide. In a typical synthesis run, 2 g of dicyandiamide was put into a crucible with a cover semi-closed and calcined in a tube furnace at 350 °C for 2 h using a heating rate of 3.9 °C min−1, and then calcined at 600 °C for 2 h using a heating rate of 2.8 °C min−1. The resulting yellow products were collected and ground into powders for further use.2.3. Fabrication of g-C3N4/BiOBr composite photocatalystsThe procedure for preparing g-C3N4/BiOBr composite photocatalysts was as follows: firstly, 1 mmol of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was dissolved into an ethanol solution containing stoichiometric amounts of the ionic liquid [C16mim]Br. Secondly, different amounts of g-C3N4 were added into the solution and the mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Thirdly, the suspension was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave up to 80% of the total volume. The autoclave was then heated at 140 °C for 24 h and cooled down to room temperature. The final solid product was collected by centrifugation, then washed with deionized water and ethanol for three times, and then dried under vacuum at 50 °C for 24 h before use in photocatalytic reactions and further characterization.2.4. CharacterizationX-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out on a Bruker D8 diffractometer with high-intensity Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) measurements were carried out with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL JWSM-7001F) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS) operated at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs were taken with a JEOL-JEM-2010 (JEOL, Japan) operating at 200 kV. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was recorded on an UV-2450 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) using BaSO4 as the reference. The structural information for samples was measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Avatar 470, Thermo Nicolet) using the standard KBr disk method. The PL spectra of the photocatalysts were detected using a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer. Photocurrent analysis and EIS were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660B Chenhua Instrument Company, Shanghai, China).2.5. Photocurrent measurementPhotocurrent tests and EIS measurements were conducted using an electrochemical analyzer with a standard three-electrode configuration. A 500 W xenon lamp was used as the photosource. The working electrodes were ITO glass (0.5 × 1 cm2) coated with the as-prepared samples (0.1 mg), and the counter electrode was a platinum wire. The reference electrode was a saturated Ag–AgCl electrode. A 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline aqueous solution (pH = 7.0) was used as the electrolyte. The EIS was performed in a 0.1 M KCl solution containing 5 mM Fe(CN)63−/(Fe(CN)64−. Sunless conditions were ensured when experiments were carried out.2.6. Photocatalytic activity measurementPhotocatalytic activities of the composite powders were evaluated by the photocatalytic degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation. Experiments were carried out in a Pyrex photocatalytic reactor with a 300 W Xe lamp with a UV cutoff filter (λ > 400 nm) as the visible-light source, and a circulating water system to prevent thermal catalytic effects. Aeration was performed using an air pump to ensure a constant supply of oxygen and full mixing of the solution and the photocatalysts during the photoreactions. The distance between the light source and the Pyrex glass was about 20 cm. In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 0.01 g of the g-C3N4/BiOBr powders was dispersed into 100 mL of the RhB (10 mg L−1) solutions. Prior to irradiation, the solution was stirred magnetically in the dark for 30 min in order to reach the adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and the RhB. During irradiation, about 3 mL of the suspension was withdrawn periodically from the reactor cell. During the process of irradiation, the intense red color of the RhB solution gradually faded. The photocatalyst powders and the RhB solutions were separated by centrifugation. The RhB concentration was analyzed by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2450), and the absorbance wavelength was 553 nm.3. Results and discussion3.1. XRD analysisThe powder XRD patterns of the as-prepared g-C3N4/BiOBr composite samples are shown in Fig. 1. The results show that the photocatalysts are well crystallized. All the diffraction peaks for the samples are readily indexed to the structure of the tetragonal phase of BiOBr (JCPDS card No. 73-2061). However, no typical patterns of g-C3N4 (0 0 2) are observed in the g-C3N4/BiOBr composites, which is due to the low g-C3N4 content in the g-C3N4/BiOBr composites and the well dispersed g-C3N4 in the composite material. The result can also be found in similar systems.44,45 No other characteristic peaks are found, indicating the high purity of the as-prepared samples. The existence of g-C3N4 is further identified by IR and EDS. Fig. 1  The XRD patterns of the as-prepared g-C3N4/BiOBr composites synthesized at different conditions. 3.2. FT-IR spectra analysisFig. 2 displays the FT-IR spectra of the pure BiOBr, and g-C3N4/BiOBr samples. The band at 1630 cm−1 in the spectrum of BiOBr corresponds to the bending vibrations of O–H. Absorption bands observed at 1567, and 1406 cm−1 are ascribed to the typical stretching modes of CN heterocycles,46 which are fully present in these g-C3N4/BiOBr composites, suggesting the maintenance of the g-C3N4 structure during the hybridization between g-C3N4 and BiOBr. The band at 810 cm−1 belongs to the characteristic breathing mode of s-triazine.47 The absorption band at 510 cm−1 is ascribed to the Bi–O stretching mode. No characteristic absorption peaks of the ionic liquid are found in the FT-IR spectra. It shows that the ionic liquid could be easily removed from the surface of the material by washing with water and alcohol. Fig. 2  FT-IR of g-C3N4/BiOBr materials with different contents of g-C3N4. 3.3. SEM, TEM and EDS analysisThe surface morphology of the as-prepared samples is examined by scanning electron microscopy. Fig. 3a–3c are typical SEM images of the 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr microspheres. As can be seen from Fig. 3a and 3b, the 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr composites synthesized have a flower-like three-dimensional structure. The flower-like microspheres consist of numerous nanosheets. Fig. 3c is the high-powered scanning electron micrograph of the flower-like 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr microspheres. It can be seen that the flower-like g-C3N4/BiOBr composite is obtained from self-assembled nanosheets with a thickness of about 10 nm. In order to investigate the morphologies of samples with different g-C3N4 contents, the SEM images have been given in Fig. S1, ESI.† As can be seen, the morphologies are similar when the g-C3N4 content is increased. Fig. 3d shows the TEM image of the 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr microspheres. It can be seen that g-C3N4/BiOBr is a microsphere structure and it can be inferred that the g-C3N4 is dispersed on the surface of the BiOBr crystal. The EDS pattern (Fig. 3e) indicates the g-C3N4/BiOBr composites contain C, N, O, Bi, and Br elements. It proves that the sample prepared was the g-C3N4/BiOBr composite material. This result is consistent with the results from FT-IR analysis that g-C3N4 is combined with BiOBr.

(d) TEM image of the 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr microsphere structures. (e) EDS of the 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr microspheres. 3.4. Optical absorption propertiesDRS of the g-C3N4/BiOBr composites is given in Fig. S2(a), ESI.† The colour of g-C3N4 is yellow, and the colour of BiOBr is white. The colour of the composites changed from white to slightly yellow when the g-C3N4 content increased. Compared with the pure BiOBr sample, the absorption of the g-C3N4/BiOBr composite samples within the visible light range apparently increased and a red shift appeared upon the addition of the g-C3N4 powder. The result indicates that g-C3N4/BiOBr composites could absorb more visible light than a pure BiOBr sample, leading to the formation of more electron–hole pairs. These results are attributed to the interaction between the g-C3N4 and BiOBr in the composite samples. Fig. S2(b), ESI† shows that the band gaps of the different content g-C3N4/BiOBr composites are lower than for the pure BiOBr. The bandgaps of the g-C3N4/BiOBr composites are about 2.70–2.76 eV. The reduced band gaps are of benefit for the transition of electrons to form electron–hole pairs and for generation of more radicals. It can be speculated that the g-C3N4/BiOBr composites can have a better photocatalytic activity than pure BiOBr in visible light.3.5. Photoluminescence spectra analysisPL spectra could be used to confirm the recombination of photo-induced electrons and holes. Photocatalytic activity is, in part, a function of the life-time and trapping of electrons and holes. After irradiation of the photocatalyst, electron–hole pair recombination occurs, photons are emitted, which leads to photoluminescence. A weaker intensity of the peak represents a lower recombination probability of photogenerated charge carriers.44,48 Fig. S3, ESI† shows the PL spectra of BiOBr and 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr. It can be seen that the photoluminescence intensity of the g-C3N4/BiOBr composite is lower than that for pure BiOBr which indicates a reduced charge recombination of the g-C3N4/BiOBr composites in comparison to BiOBr alone. This result indicates that the introduction of g-C3N4 reduces the recombination efficiency of electron–hole pairs. In other words, the combination of BiOBr and g-C3N4 contributes to improving the photocatalytic activity of BiOBr.3.6. Photocurrent analysisA photocurrent is generated by the electron transfer from the conduction band of samples to the electrodes. In general, a higher photocurrent would mean the presence of longer living photogenerated carriers and hence a higher photocatalytic activity.49,50Fig. 4 summarizes the currents measured for BiOBr and 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr. As can be seen, the dark current is very low. Upon light illumination, the photocurrent increases sharply reaching a steady state quickly. The current returns quickly to its dark current state when the light is turned off. The 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr has a higher current than that of the pure BiOBr. The result indicates that the introduction of g-C3N4 improves the separation efficiency of electrons and holes. Fig. 4  Transient photocurrent response for the pure BiOBr and 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr. 3.7. EIS analysisEIS measurements have been used to investigate the charge transfer resistance. They have similar plots with one semicircle in the high frequency region and an incline straight line in the low frequency region. The semicircle in the high frequency region is attributable to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), showing the charge transfer through the electrode/electrolyte interface. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the diameter of the Nyquist circle of 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr is smaller than that of BiOBr. It indicates that 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr has a lower resistance than that for pure BiOBr which can accelerate the interfacial charge-transfer process. The results of photocurrent and EIS analysis demonstrate that the introduction of g-C3N4 into BiOBr can improve the separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs,51 contributing to the enhanced photocatalytic activity. Fig. 5  Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of BiOBr and 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr. 3.8. Photocatalytic performanceRhB was chosen as the target pollutant to measure the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4/BiOBr under visible-light irradiation, as shown in Fig. 6a. It could be seen that the introduction of different amounts of g-C3N4 could improve the photocatalytic activity of BiOBr. The 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr composite shows the highest activity, which is much better than for pure BiOBr, as well as the composites with other g-C3N4 contents. After irradiation for 30 min, only 39% of RhB was photodegraded by pure BiOBr, while 87% of RhB was photodegraded by 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr. When the g-C3N4 content is higher than 3 wt%, a further increase of g-C3N4 content causes a decrease in the photocatalytic activity of RhB degradation. The variation of UV-visible absorption spectra of RhB degraded over 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr is shown in Fig. 6b. Under visible light illumination, the color of the RhB solution changes from a red to light green and then disappears during the reaction. The peak intensity of the UV-visible absorption related to RhB decreases significantly, and the maximum absorption of the RhB solution shifts from 553 to 510 nm after irradiation for 60 min. Fig. 6  (a) Effects of g-C3N4/BiOBr with different g-C3N4 contents on RhB photocatalytic degradation efficiency; (b) temporal UV-vis absorption spectral changes during the photocatalytic degradation of RhB in aqueous solution in the presence of 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr. 3.9. The proposed mechanismAs is well known, the photoinduced holes or the formed hydroxyl radicals are the two main species for the oxidization of organic pollutants.52 The species in our photodegradation process is confirmed by the hole or hydroxyl radical trapping experiments.53Fig. 7 shows the photocatalytic activities of the 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr composite for the degradation of RhB with or without adding EDTA–2Na and t-butanol under visible light irradiation. It can be seen that the degradation efficiency of RhB decreased significantly upon addition of disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA–2Na, a quencher of holes), with 90% of RhB remaining in the solution after irradiation for 150 min. On the contrary, the photocatalytic activity is somewhat restrained when tertiary butanol (TBA, a quencher of ˙OH) was added. The above results indicate that holes were the main reactive species for the degradation of RhB. Fig. 7  Comparison of photocatalytic activities of the 3 wt% g-C3N4/BiOBr catalyst for the degradation of RhB with or without adding EDTA–2Na and t-Butanol under visible light irradiation. The band structure of a photocatalyst is responsible for the efficient generation and separation process of the electron–hole pairs. The valence band (VB) potentials can be theoretically predicted by the following empirical equation: EVB = X − Ee + 0.5Eg, where EVB is the valence band edge potential, X is the electronegativity of the semiconductor, which is the geometric mean of the electronegativity of the constituent atoms, Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (∼4.5 eV), and Eg is the band gap energy of the photocatalyst. Moreover, the conduction band edge potential (ECB) can be acquired by the formula ECB = EVB − Eg. The EVB of BiOBr was calculated to be 3.06 eV. Thus, the ECB of BiOBr is estimated to be 0.29 eV. The theoretical calculated values of the CB and VB potentials of the g-C3N4 material were −1.12 and 1.57 eV.44 Based on the experimental and theoretical results, the reaction mechanism diagram of the g-C3N4/BiOBr composites is presented in Scheme 1. Scheme 1  Schematic of the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges in the g-C3N4/BiOBr material combined with the possible reaction mechanism for the photocatalytic procedure. With the induction of light, both BiOBr and g-C3N4 in the composite can be excited and engender photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Because the CB edge potential of g-C3N4 (−1.12 eV) is more negative than that of BiOBr (0.29 eV), and the VB of BiOBr is more positive than that of g-C3N4, the photoinduced electrons on the g-C3N4 surface can transfer easily to the CB of BiOBr, leaving the holes on the g-C3N4 valence band. At the same time, these exited holes on the VB of BiOBr would migrate to the VB of g-C3N4. Therefore, the electron–hole pairs are separated efficiently on the composite interface and also the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes is effectively reduced. As a result, the g-C3N4/BiOBr composites have increased photocatalytic activity.4. ConclusionsIn summary, g-C3N4/BiOBr composite photocatalysts have been successfully synthesized in the presence of the reactable ionic liquid [C16mim]Br. SEM analysis indicated that g-C3N4/BiOBr composites were flower-like microspheres consisting of numerous nanosheets. DRS analysis indicated that the bandgaps of the g-C3N4/BiOBr composites were lower than those for the pure BiOBr. Enhanced photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4/BiOBr composite photocatalysts has been observed. PL, EIS, and photocurrent analysis of the photocatalytic mechanism, indicated that g-C3N4 combined and dispersed well on the surface of BiOBr which facilitated electron–hole separation, and led to the increased photocatalytic activity. The radical trap experiments showed that the hole was the main reactive species for the degradation of RhB. The introduction of g-C3N4 to BiOBr contributed to the improved performance of BiOBr. The optimal proportion of g-C3N4 in the composite was 3 wt%.AcknowledgementsThis work was financially supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 21206060, 21007021 and 21177050), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2012M510125), Jiangsu Province (1102118C), and the Doctoral Innovation Fund of Jiangsu (CXZZ12_0668).ReferencesZ.
