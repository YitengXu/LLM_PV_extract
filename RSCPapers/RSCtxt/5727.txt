    , Accepted 13th December 2019First published on 17th December 2019AbstractThe strategy of using ternary blends for the active layer becomes increasingly important in single-junction organic solar cells (OSCs), particularly for boosting the performance of high-performance non-fullerene-based devices. In this work, a non-fullerene small molecule named IT-4F with a moderate bandgap (1.58 eV) is introduced as the third component into the PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl binary blend, where IXIC-4Cl is a low-bandgap acceptor with absorption up to ∼1000 nm. Compared to the 11.99% and 13.47% efficiencies for the binary devices based on PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl and PDBD-T-2Cl:IT-4F, respectively, the ternary OSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.96% when the weight ratio of PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl:IT-4F is 1.0:0.3:0.7. Through device and film characterization, IT-4F is shown to be an effective third component with functionalities including modulating the electronic properties, adjusting the frontier orbital energy levels, complementing the absorption spectrum and improving the active-layer morphology, which lead to significantly increased open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF). Our method could be employed as a general approach to enhance the performance of nonfullerene OSCs based on low-bandgap small molecule acceptors.
Introduction
Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have been widely studied due to their strong absorption and tunable electronic and optical properties.1–22 Thanks to device engineering and material innovation, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of NFA-based binary organic solar cells (OSCs) is over 15%.23–30 Ternary OSCs are now one of the most promising methods to improve the performance due to their outstanding advantages, including tuning the energy levels by controlling the proportions of the components, broadening the absorption spectra, improving the morphology by doping with specific materials to change the global crystallinity, forming possible cascade charge transfer structures, enhancing the efficiency of exciton dissociation by capturing photons manifested as energy transfer, and coexisting charge transfer tunnels due to alloy-like structures achieved by ternary systems. Noticeably, due to the similarity in surface tension, different NFAs could have decent miscibility in the active layer, which, in combination with the wide-range tunability of their energy levels and absorption profiles, makes them ideal for donor:acceptor:acceptor (D:A:A)-type ternary devices.31–37 Not only can different NFAs form complementary absorption and thus enhance the efficiency, but the interplay between the two acceptors as well as between the acceptors and donors can also provide a model system to investigate the mechanism of the ternary blend.38–57
Some of the state-of-the-art NFAs have extremely red absorption that can cover the near-infrared region, e.g., 900 to 1000 nm, which is favorable for broadening the absorption spectrum of the active layer.58–61 However, the device performance based on polymer donors and this kind of NFAs is mostly lower than expected. For example, IOIC-2Cl shows an absorption edge of ∼1000 nm, but the PBDB-T-2Cl:IOIC-2Cl binary device exhibits a PCE of only 11.6%, with a short-circuit current (JSC) of 19.16 mA cm−2. A similar result is observed in PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl based OSCs, where the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) are 0.787 V and 69.5%, respectively. The main reason for the low performance of these binary systems could be the energetics of the active layer. For instance, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)–LUMO offset between PBDB-T-2Cl (−3.57 eV) and IOIC-2Cl (−4.10 eV) is too large, which is detrimental for VOC, while the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–HOMO offset (−5.50 eV and −5.52 eV for PBDB-T-2Cl and IOIC-2Cl, respectively) is nearly zero, which could hinder charge transfer. The PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl system faces the same problem (LUMOIXIC-4Cl = −4.13 eV, HOMOIXIC-4Cl = −5.52 eV). To solve this problem, it is necessary to tune the electronic properties and a reasonable approach is to introduce a proper third component into the host system to form a ternary blend.
In this work, we incorporate IT-4F into the PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl blend and study the effect of this molecule on the device performance and working principle. IT-4F is chosen as the third component for two main reasons. First, IT-4F is compatible with the donor PBDB-T-2Cl in binary devices. Second, it has a moderate bandgap (absorption edge ∼800 nm) that makes its absorption complementary to both PBDB-T-2Cl and IXIC-4Cl, allowing it to fill the absorption gap between PBDB-T-2Cl and IXIC-4Cl. Consequently, the PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl:IT-4F based ternary OSCs perform significantly better than both binary systems. The best performance is achieved at a weight ratio of 1:0.3:0.7 for PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl:IT-4F, with a PCE of 14.96%. Compared to PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl (11.99%) and PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F (13.47%), the clear improvement made by the ternary device is mainly attributed to the large enhancement in JSC. Overall, the design principle of this work, namely, adding a moderate-bandgap small molecule acceptor as the third component to modulate the electronic and optical properties of the active layer, could be applied to various low-bandgap NFA-based systems and serve as a general method to increase the performance of non-fullerene OSCs.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures of PBDB-T-2Cl, IXIC-4Cl, and IT-4F are shown in Fig. 1a. A series of devices using different weight ratios of PBDB-T-2Cl, IXIC-4Cl, and IT-4F were fabricated with a device structure shown in the same figure. Fig. 1b is the energy diagram of all materials in this work and the values were obtained by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV). The HOMO of PBDB-T-2Cl (−5.51 eV) is close to that of IXIC-4Cl (−5.52 eV) while that of IT-4F is deeper (−5.69 eV). The LUMOs of PBDB-T-2Cl (−3.57 eV), IT-4F (−4.07 eV) and IXIC-4Cl (−4.13 eV) are cascaded. Furthermore, Fig. 1c shows that the main absorption of these three materials is complementary. At a weight ratio of 1:0.5:0.5 and 1:0.3:0.7, the PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl:IT-4F ternary blend film exhibits one more main absorption peak than binary blend films according to Fig. 1d.

ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/PNDIT-F3N/Ag structured conventional devices are fabricated to investigate the performance of the binary and ternary OSCs. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 2a, and Table 1 shows the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. Binary OSCs based on PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl show a PCE of 11.99%, with a VOC of 0.787 V, a JSC of 21.907 mA cm2 and a FF of 0.695. In contrast, the PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F-based binary OSCs exhibit a higher PCE (13.47%), with an increased VOC (0.884 V) and FF (0.764), yet a reduced JSC (19.941 mA cm−2). Obviously, the relatively low FF and VOC are the limiting factors of the PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl-based OSCs. Next, IT-4F was added into the host system, and the optimized ternary device was obtained at a weight ratio of 1:0.3:0.7 for PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl:IT-4F, where the best PCE is as high as 14.96%, with a VOC of 0.847 V, a JSC of 23.655 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.747. From the PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl binary OSCs to the ternary device, the JSC increased by 24.8%. Fig. 2b shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and integrated JSCs are provided in Table 1, which are within 3% error compared with values from the J–V measurements.

To understand the mechanism of our ternary OSCs, we measured the photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 2c, excited at 760 nm) of neat IXIC-4Cl and IT-4F and their blend films with different compositions to investigate whether energy transfer between IXIC-4Cl and IT-4F occurs. The neat film of IXIC-4Cl exhibits a relatively weak PL peak at ∼970 nm while IT-4F shows a strong peak at ∼800 nm. The PL signal of the IXIC-4Cl:IT-4F (0.3:0.7) blend film is not the linear superposition of that of the IXIC-4Cl and IT-4F pure films. In the acceptor blend film, the emission of IT-4F is effectively quenched, while that of IXIC-4Cl shows a clear improvement, indicating energy transfer from IT-4F to IXIC-4Cl. Furthermore, solar cell devices based on pure IXIC-4Cl, pure IT-4F or the blend (IXIC-4Cl:IT-4F = 0.3:0.7) were made to investigate whether there is charge transfer between IXIC-4Cl and IT-4F. The JSC values of the devices based on pure IXIC-4Cl and pure IT-4F are 0.905 and 0.225 mA cm−2, respectively, and that of the blend film-based device is 0.622 mA cm−2. These results indicate that there is no significant charge transfer between IXIC-4Cl and IT-4F.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out to understand the morphology difference between the binary and ternary blend films. From the AFM height images shown in Fig. 3a, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values for the PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl and PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F binary blend films and the PBDB-T:IXIC-4Cl:IT-4F (1:0.3:0.7) ternary blend film are 2.48, 1.63 and 2.11 nm, respectively. To probe the detailed morphology and phase separation, we performed grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) experiments. Fractal-like network and Debye–Anderson–Brumberger models were employed to analyze the scattering with contributions from the pure phase domain and intermixed amorphous phase. The pure phase domain sizes (2Rg) of the PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl and PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F binary films and the optimal ternary film are 11.6, 7.26 and 11.0 nm, respectively, and the corresponding intermixing domain sizes are 13.6, 35.2 and 25.9 nm, respectively. Compared to the binary film of PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl, the introduction of IT-4F in the ternary film enhances the intermixing, which would promote exciton dissociation and thus increase the photocurrent. On the other hand, the ternary blend shows a more favorable amount of intermixing compared to the PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F binary blend, which could balance charge transport and exciton splitting by suppressing excessive intermixing. Overall, the smaller pure phase domain sizes and the enlarged intermixing domain sizes enabled by incorporating IT-4F enhance exciton dissociation and facilitate charge transport (Fig. 4).

To further understand the crystallinity and molecular packing, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) experiments were conducted. The (100) lamellar packing of the IXIC-4Cl and IT-4F neat films is found at a qr of 0.45 and 0.35 Å−1, respectively, which corresponds to d-spacings of 14.0 and 17.9 Å. Furthermore, the π–π stacking of IT-4F is much weaker as indicated by the broad and gradual scattering near 1.7 Å−1, while that of IXIC-4Cl is stronger with a peak at a qz of 1.76 Å−1, whose d-spacing is 3.57 Å. This indicates that IXIC-4Cl has a much stronger π–π stacking propensity. For the PBDB-T-2Cl neat film, the lamellar peak is found at a qz of 0.31 Å−1 (d = 20.3 Å) together with a π–π stacking peak at a qz of 1.60 Å−1 (d = 3.93 Å). In addition, crystalline coherence lengths (CCLs) were calculated using CCL = 1.8π/FWHM, where FWHM is the full width at half-maximum for the peaks in the intensity profile, which is an estimate of the length over which the ordered crystalline packing is maintained. The PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F film and ternary film exhibited a similar CCL of 16.3 Å of the π–π peak while PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl is more prone to aggregate (CCL of the π–π peak = 29.5 Å), which is consistent with the conclusion obtained from AFM and GISAXS that adding IT-4F decreases the pure phase domain size of the active layer.
The photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) is measured to study charge generation and extraction (Fig. 5a). The saturation current (Jsat), exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) can be calculated (Table S1, ESI†). The ηdiss values of PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl, PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F and PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl:IT-4F are 91.6%, 96.8% and 94.4%, respectively. The corresponding ηcoll values are 78.4%, 85.7% and 84.1%. This indicates that adding IT-4F into the host binary system (PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl) is able to increase the exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency concurrently, which is in accordance with the results of GISAXS. In Fig. 5b, we plot VOC of the binary and ternary devices as a function of the IT-4F content in the blend. The increase in VOC shows an almost linear dependence on the content of IT-4F, which indicates the decent miscibility of the two acceptors and possibly an alloy-like morphology for the acceptor phase.62,63 Furthermore, the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method was utilized to estimate the hole and electron mobilities of the blend films. As shown in Table S2 (ESI†), the hole and electron mobilities decrease as the load of IT-4F increases. The corresponding hole/electron ratios (μh/μe) are 1.93, 1.68 and 1.55, for PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl, PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl:IT-4F and PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F, respectively, which agrees with the GISAXS results. The addition of IT-4F leads to more balanced μh/μe, which is favorable for charge collection. Next, we studied the relationship between JSC and light intensity, which can be described by the power-law formula: JSC ∝ PlightS. The result is shown in Fig. 5d, where the S values of PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl, PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl:IT-4F and PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F are 0.948, 0.967 and 0.977, respectively, which indicates that the incorporation of IT-4F reduces bimolecular recombination in the active layer.

Conclusion
In summary, we employ a moderate-bandgap small molecule acceptor, IT-4F, as the third component and fabricate a series of OSCs using PBDB-T-2Cl as the donor and IXIC-4Cl and IT-4F as the acceptors. We have shown that IT-4F was able to complement the absorption of the binary blend of PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl, which increases the photocurrent of the solar cell. In addition, energy transfer between IT-4F and IXIC-4Cl is observed. More importantly, IT-4F is able to suppress the excessive aggregation/crystallization tendency of IXIC-4Cl, which improves the morphology of the active layer. These beneficial features offered by IT-4F allow the ternary device to perform better than either binary counterpart. The best PCE for the ternary device is as high as 14.96%, obtained at a weight ratio of 1:0.3:0.7 for PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl:IT-4F, which is a remarkable improvement compared with the binary devices. Detailed device and film characterization reveals that the ternary blend film has a more optimized morphology, which enhances exciton dissociation, reduces charge recombination and balances charge transport. This work sheds light on the design of ternary material systems when the performance of a binary blend that contains a low-bandgap acceptor is limited.
