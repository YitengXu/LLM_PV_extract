    , Accepted 6th November 2018First published on 6th November 2018AbstractThe ternary concept based on two electron donors and one electron acceptor has been deployed to extend the absorption as well as photovoltaic performance of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). However, it is still challenging to achieve the delicate morphology of ternary blended bulk-heterojunction films through rational molecular design. To overcome these issues, herein, we designed and synthesized a series of narrow bandgap conjugated copolymers by combining two conjugated polymers with various molar ratios of the naphthobis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NT) unit (namely, NT00–NT100). All-PSCs were constructed by integrating these resultant copolymers with a commercially available electron-accepting copolymer N2200. The resultant all-PSCs based on the ternary copolymers NT40 exhibited an impressively high power conversion efficiency over 8.0%, which was clearly superior to that obtained for devices based on the NT00:NT100:N2200 blended films. Further characterization of the morphology of the films revealed that the incorporation of the NT unit improved π–π stacking and a degree of phase separation, which are conducive to exciton diffusion and charge transport.
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention since they are light-weight, show great potential for the fabrication of flexible devices based on roll-to-roll processing, and have a short energy payback time.1–7 Considerable progress has been made recently in the development of high-performance PSCs due to the emergence of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), which have high absorption coefficients that facilitate the harvesting of solar photons.8–11 Even though all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) with a polymer donor and a polymer acceptor have lower photovoltaic performances than the devices based on fullerene derivatives or NFAs, they have attracted particular interest due to their high photochemical, thermal, and mechanical stability.12–24
To improve the photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs, one critical challenge is to develop novel p-type copolymers with appropriate frontier molecular orbital energy levels and high absorption profiles that can pair with relevant n-type copolymers.25–27 A representative case is the recently developed electron-donating conjugated polymer comprising an imide-functionalized benzotriazole unit in combination with an electron-accepting copolymer poly{[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} (termed N2200), with impressively high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of >9%. The improved photovoltaic performance can also benefit from complementary absorption by physically blending two electron-donating polymers with electron-accepting polymers, leading to PCEs >10%.28 However, such a ternary blending approach remains challenging since the crystallinity, domain sizes, and domain purity are more difficult to control in ternary mixtures than in binary mixtures.29–31
Herein, we developed a series of ternary-conjugated copolymers consisting of two electron-rich units of thiophene and benzodithiophene and an electron-deficient unit of naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) (NT).32,33 The resultant copolymers having different molar ratios of the NT moiety (10 to 100%) were synthesized using the Stille method (Scheme S1, in the ESI†) and named NT10 to NT100. For comparison, the binary copolymer with alternating thiophene and benzodithiophene backbone (namely NT00) was also synthesized (Fig. 1a).

The corresponding binary copolymers, namely, NT00 and NT100, showed highly complementary absorption spectra. In addition, the absorption spectra of the random ternary polymers gradually broadened, increasing the absorption from 600 to 800 nm as the concentration of NT in the copolymer increased (Fig. 1b). The copolymer NT40 showed panchromatic absorption from 400 to 800 nm, which was advantageous for harvesting light. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels gradually decreased from −5.22 eV for NT10 to −5.52 eV for NT100. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels gradually decreased from −3.00 eV for NT10 to −3.40 eV for NT100 (Fig. 1c, Table S1 in the ESI†). For these copolymers, the gradual decrease in HOMO energy levels with the increase in NT content was advantageous for increasing the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of all-PSCs.34
The photovoltaic performances of the binary and ternary all-PSCs based on the resultant polymers were evaluated using a conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer donor:N2200/PFN-Br/Ag. Herein, we used poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] dibromide (PFN-Br) as the electron transport layer.35,36 All-PSCs based on the alternative copolymers had moderate PCEs of 3.20% for NT00:N2200 (device A) and 3.51% for NT100:N2200 (device C). We then optimized the content of NT in the copolymers (Fig. S3 and Table S2, ESI†). The optimized all-PSC based on NT40:N2200 (device B) showed remarkable photovoltaic performance with a maximum PCE of 8.06%, a VOC of 0.80 ± 0.01 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 14.87 ± 0.19 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 67.16 ± 0.60% (Table 1). Furthermore, we also explored the photovoltaic properties of the ternary blend all-PSCs composed of NT00:NT100:N2200 with varying weight ratios of NT100 (0–100% in 10% increments) under the same processing condition (Fig. S4, ESI†). However, the incorporation of 40 wt% NT100 into the NT00:N2200 film (device D) only led to a PCE of 4.81%, indicating that the random copolymer with panchromatic absorption can effectively improve the JSC value and may yield a favorable film morphology for efficient simultaneous charge transport. It is also noteworthy that the NT40 copolymer with a different molecular weight had a similar PCE of ∼7.9% (Fig. S5, ESI†). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of these devices (Fig. 2b) agreed with the corresponding absorption spectra of the blend films (Fig. S1 in the ESI†).

Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were recorded to elucidate the charge generation and recombination kinetics for these all-PSCs. The PL quenching efficiency was 87.7% for device A, 97.5% for device B, 88.3% for device C and 92.6% for device D (Fig. S6, ESI†). The highest PL quenching efficiency of 97.5% for device B indicated the efficient charge carrier dissociation and improved miscibility of the copolymers and N2200. In order to investigate exciton dissociation and carrier generation, we measured the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) of the devices. The photocurrent density (Jph) is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD represent the current densities measured under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = Vbi − Vappl, where Vbi is the voltage when J = 0 (the built-in voltage) and Vappl is the applied voltage. The exciton dissociation probability P(E, T) values can be calculated from the value of the photocurrent density (Jph) divided by the saturated photocurrent density (Jsat). The dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) showed that device B had the highest Gmax and P(E, T) values (Fig. 3a and Table S5, ESI†),37 indicating that device B had good exciton dissociation and carrier generation characteristics and thus high JSC values. Charge carrier mobility was measured using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method in hole-only and electron-only devices (Fig. S7 and Table S6, ESI†). All devices had similar electron-mobility (μe) values exceeding 1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 owing to the same electron acceptor N2200 in the active layer blend films. Device B had the highest hole-mobility (μh) of 6.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to a more balanced μh/μe ratio than that for device D, which can maximize photocurrent and suppress bimolecular recombination in device B.

We also measured photovoltaic parameters as a function of light intensity (Plight) to probe the charge recombination dynamics in the photoactive layer (Fig. 3b and c). The plots ofJSCversusPlight are illustrated according to the power law dependence of JSC upon illumination intensity, JSC ∝ (Plight)S, where Plight is the light intensity and S is the exponential factor that is close to unity under weak bimolecular recombination.38 The devices A–D had a very close S value approaching 1.0, indicating the similar weak bimolecular recombination for these devices. The slope of VOCversus the natural logarithm of Plight can also be used to elucidate the charge recombination mechanisms for these devices. A slope close to kT/q indicates that the bimolecular recombination was predominant and the trap-assisted mechanism was weak. The parameters k, T, and q represent the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and elementary charge, respectively.39 As extracted from Fig. 3c, devices A, B, C, and D have a slope of 1.42, 1.20, 2.13 and 1.59 kT/q, respectively. The lowest slope of device B, which is close to kT/q, suggests suppressed trap-assisted recombination, thus resulting in high FF.36,40Fig. 3d illustrates the dark J–V curves for devices A–D with an active layer thickness of around 100 nm. Diode ideality factor (n) was obtained by fitting the dark J–V curves via a one diode replacement circuit.41 The resulting diode ideality factor was 1.81, 1.72, 1.84, and 1.86 for device A, B, C, and D, respectively. The slightly lower ideality factor for device B can be understood as weaker recombination induced by defect states.
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to characterize the ordering of the neat polymers and polymer blends. As can be seen from the diffraction patterns (Fig. S8†), NT00 shows a predominant face-on orientation, as evidenced by the (010) π–π reflection in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction at q = 1.69 Å−1 (d = 3.72 Å, d = 2π/q) with a crystal coherence length (CCL) of 1.78 nm and the (100) reflection in the in-plane (IP) direction characteristic of the lamellar stacking at q = 0.30 Å−1. NT100 shows a compact π–π stacking distance as a sharp (010) peak emerges at a high q value of 1.81 Å−1 (d = 3.47 Å) with a CCL of 3.23 nm, while the edge-on π–π stacking signal of low intensity can be seen in the 2D diffraction patterns. Higher order reflections of the lamellar peak, namely, (100) and (200), are seen for NT100 in the OOP direction, arising from the NT moieties in the conjugated backbone. Thus, the incorporation of NT into the NT00 polymer backbone has great impact on the polymer packing in the solid-state. Compared with NT00, NT40 showed enhanced molecular co-facial packing, as indicated by the sharper (010) peak in the OOP direction at 1.71 Å−1 (d = 3.67 Å) with a CCL of 2.24 nm. This finding indicated that the NT units within the polymer backbone improved the π–π stacking and increased the crystal size of polymers. The blend films showed scattering features that were characteristic of each component (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4e, the NT00:N2200 blend showed a broad (010) peak in the OOP direction at ∼1.73 Å−1. The (100) reflection in the IP direction splits into 0.25 and 0.30 Å−1 peaks, arising from the lamellar stacking of N2200 and NT00, respectively. The (001) peak in the IP direction at 0.46 Å−1 is associated with the backbone of N2200. It should be noted that (100) peaks in OOP direction are seen for NT00:N2200 and NT40:N2200, which are not observed for the corresponding neat films, suggesting that the lamellar packing of either or both materials improved. On comparing the NT40:N2200 binary and NT00:NT100:N2200 ternary blends, we found that the lamellar stacking and π–π stacking regions have no distinct differences due to the similar scattering features of the polymers. However, after normalizing the 2.5–3.0 Å−1 region signals in the OOP direction (Fig. S9, ESI†), the NT40:N2200 blend displayed more intense π–π stacking feature than the NT00:NT100:N2200 ternary blend. This may be one of the reasons for higher SCLC mobility and FF of NT40 based devices.

The size of the phase-separated domains for the all-polymer blends was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS). As shown in Fig. 5a–d, the NT00:N2200 blend film showed large fiber-like aggregates across the entire film, while the NT100:N2200 blend film showed a much smaller, less well-defined texture. The NT40:N2200 blend film showed a small size fibrillary-like texture, while the NT00:NT100:N2200 ternary blend film showed a better-developed fibril structure that was less well-defined than that of the binary NT00:N2200 blend film. RSoXS profiles of the four blends using optimized photon energy (285.2 eV) are shown in Fig. 5e. The NT00:N2200 blend film had an interference at q = 0.045 Å−1, corresponding to a spacing of ∼140 nm, which was consistent with the TEM results as well as the poor JSC and FF of device A. In contrast, scattering from the NT100:N2200 blend monotonically decreased over the entire scattering vector range, with no discernible characteristic length scale. The highly intimately mixed domains of NT100:N2200 were detrimental to the efficient charge transport, leading to reduced JSC and FF. This finding is also in agreement with the TEM results, where phase separation, if present, occurred on a very small length scale. It is reasonable to conclude that the incorporation of NT unit into conjugated the polymer backbone promoted miscibility for NT00 and N2200. This is also evident in the NT40:N2200 blend where an interference was seen at q = ∼0.016 Å−1, corresponding to the average center-to-center distance of about 39 nm, which was much smaller than that for the NT00:N2200 and appropriate for exciton diffusion, charge transport, and the enhancement of JSC and high FF of device B. However, for the NT00:NT100:N2200 ternary blend film, evidence for a relatively large-scale phase separation is seen with the interference occurring at q = ∼0.081 Å−1, corresponding to a distance of 78 nm, which is in agreement with the observed lower device performance. The detailed morphological characterization again underlined the significance of the findings demonstrated in this study. By combining two polymer donors in a random copolymer structure with various molar ratios, the delicate bulk-heterojunction microstructural morphology can be effectively controlled to facilitate efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. This paves a way for designing novel conjugated polymers for the next generation efficient all-PSCs.

In conclusion, we developed a novel concept to overcome the bulk-heterojunction morphology and efficiency limit in all-PSCs by designing and synthesizing a series of ternary copolymers whose optical properties and energy levels were effectively tuned by controlling the molar ratio of each component, thus enabling panchromatic absorption with suitable energy levels. All-PSCs based on the random ternary copolymer NT40 showed superior photovoltaic performance to that of its binary and ternary blended counterparts. This enhanced performance was attributed to its strong and broad absorption spectrum, favourable film morphology, and suppressed recombination. Our study demonstrates that ternary copolymers with broader absorption can open the horizon for fabricating high-performance all-PSCs. In addition, the desired bulk heterojunction microstructural morphology can be finely tuned by modifying the composition and molar ratio of random copolymers, leading to efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport and enhanced photovoltaic performance. From our studies it is apparent that the photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs maybe further improved by designing efficient random copolymers with absorptions that cover the visible and near infrared regions.
