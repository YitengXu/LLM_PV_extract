    , Accepted 11th October 2019First published on 11th October 2019AbstractEnergy offsets at the electron donor/acceptor interface play an important role in the operation of organic solar cells (OSCs), because their magnitude strongly affects the efficiency of photo-induced charge separation and hence the short-circuit current of a device under illumination. However, quantitative assessment of energy offsets in operating devices remains an open challenge that is still out of the reach of present techniques. Here we show that the ratio of the radiative efficiency (EQEEL) for a blend device to that for the lower bandgap component device (usually a non-fullerene acceptor), namely the EQEEL ratio, can be a strong indicator of the energy offsets in the blend device. In photovoltaic devices based on donors and acceptors with similar backbone structure but varied energy levels, lowering the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) offset increases the open-circuit voltage (VOC) from 0.95 V to 1.05 V, which is consistent with the EQEEL variation trends in the devices. The blend EQEEL approaches that of the emissive low bandgap acceptor when the HOMO of the donor is sufficiently deepened, which at the same time corresponds to a reduction in VOC loss and inefficient photoinduced charge separation. The results suggest that the intrinsic energy loss associated with charge separation can be minimized in practice by minimizing the energy offsets but at the expense of lowering the charge separation efficiency. Statistics from several state-of-the-art material systems reveal that efficient charge generation occurs when the EQEEL ratio is less than 0.1, corresponding to an additional non-radiative voltage loss due to the energy offset of 60 mV. Based on this finding and a modified Shockley–Queisser theory, we estimate an upper thermodynamic efficiency limit for single-junction organic solar cells of about 31%, which is slightly below the Shockley–Queisser limit.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs), which comprise organic semiconducting donor and acceptor materials, have shown promise as a low-cost renewable energy source. Recently, the power conversion efficiency of OSCs has skyrocketed from around 10 to more than 16% because of the distinctive advantages of non-fullerene small molecular acceptors (SMAs). The successful implantation of SMAs in OSCs has greatly reduced the energy offset required between the donor and acceptor to drive photon-to-electron conversion, resulting in improved energy usage in these devices. Although it is recognized that the energy offset plays a decisive role in the operation of OSCs, the accurate evaluation of the offset in different donor/acceptor systems remains challenging because of the used empirical methods based on electronic orbital energy measurements. In this contribution, we propose an electroluminescence efficiency measurement approach to be a reliable way to probe the energy offset directly from a working device. Our study on extensive non-fullerene systems gives an optimal energy offset that can properly balance charge generation and voltage loss. Based on the findings, we conclude our work could provide guidelines for future SMA design and energy offset optimization.

Introduction
Nowadays, small molecule electron acceptors have emerged as promising alternatives to fullerene derivatives for organic solar cells (OSCs), boosting the power conversion efficiency to over 16%.1,2 One of the major advantages of non-fullerene electron acceptors is their relatively small energy offsets required to drive charge separation3,4 and hence the energy loss associated with the charge separation process can be as small as 0.4–0.5 eV,5 comparable to that of other high performing photovoltaic technologies such as crystalline silicon or perovskite solar cells.6 Extensive studies suggest that the difference in the ionization potential (IP) or electron affinity (EA) between the donor and acceptor7 or the electronic orbital energy offset between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) of single components is a key determinant of the charge separation efficiency.8 Hence, accurate determination of the energy offsets is vital for material design guidelines and probing charge transfer therein.
However, the commonly used experimental methods for assessing the energy offsets at the D/A interface rely on a range of empirical methodologies, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) data of individual components in solution and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) on neat films of the components,9,10 which might cause significant systematic errors. Moreover, the concept of molecular orbitals is no longer applicable in D/A blends, since the intermolecular interactions between the two components cause additional changes in the energy levels.11 In addition, both CV and UPS measurements suffer from several shortcomings, such as failing to give an accurate representation of the magnitude and less reproducibility. For example, the obtained HOMO levels of the typical non-fullerene acceptor ITIC measured by different research groups span from −5.48 eV to −5.80 eV.12–14 Even in the same group, considerable deviation up to 0.1 eV can be observed.13,15,16 Hence, evaluation of the charge transfer efficiency by the electronic orbital energy offset at the D/A interface appears to be empirical.
Alternatively, the energy offset driving charge separation can be estimated by measuring the charge transfer energy (ECT) from absorption and emission of interfacial charge transfer states (CT states) using Marcus theory, and comparing ECT with the optical bandgap of either the donor or acceptor (ΔE = Eg − ECT).17,18 However, some studies have provided evidence that the electroluminescence (EL) of devices based on non-fullerene acceptors is dominated by the transitions of singlet excitons formed in the low bandgap component.19,20 In that case, the feature of charge transfer states vanishes (also see Fig. S1 for example, ESI†),3,21 and to accurately determine the energetic conditions for charge separation in these systems presents a big challenge.
In this study, the photovoltaic properties of devices based on a series of donors and fluorinated acceptors with similar backbones but different energy levels were investigated. The HOMO shift in the donor materials allows us to identify the correlation between the energy offset and charge separation efficiency via radiative efficiency (EQEEL) measurements of the electroluminescence and internal quantum efficiency (IQE). We found that the ratio of the EQEEL for the blend device to that for the lower bandgap acceptor device can serve to quantify the energy offset and estimate the corresponding charge separation efficiency in the complete device. Furthermore, energetic loss analysis using a detailed-balance approach reveals that the voltage loss due to non-radiative recombination (ΔVnon-radOC) decreases with decreasing energy offset at the interface, however, at the expense of reducing the charge separation efficiency and concomitantly reducing the IQE. A similar trend was observed in material systems with varying HOMO energy levels in the acceptors. Therefore, a sufficiently high energy offset at the D/A interface is indispensable for efficient charge separation, although it leads to an additional non-radiative voltage loss of 60 mV in devices.
Results and discussion
Materials and their photovoltaic properties and radiative properties
In this study, we use low bandgap small molecule i-IEICO22 and two of its fluorinated derivatives (i-IEICO-2F and i-IEICO-4F23) with varying HOMO levels as electron acceptors, and four thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (TPD)-based wide bandgap semiconducting polymers24 (PTH37, PMT49, PMOT39 and PMTT56) with varied conjugated side chains and HOMO levels as electron donors. The chemical structure of the donors and acceptors, as well as their HOMO values measured by UPS (see Fig. S2, ESI†), are shown in Fig. 1a.
 Fig. 1  (a) Chemical structures of the polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors used in this study, together with the HOMO levels for the donor and acceptor materials obtained from ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS, see Fig. S2, ESI†). (b) Schematic diagrams of how the HOMO offset functions in OSCs under working conditions (driving energy for hole transfer, left) or the electroluminescence experiment (potential barrier for hole injection, middle), and the concept demonstration showing EQEEL modulated by the HOMO offset (right). 
Both the acceptors and the donors possess an invariant conjugated backbone, enabling us to modify the energy levels via side-chain engineering or fluorination,25,26 thus without causing pronounced change in the film morphology (as is ensured by transmission electron microscopy measurements in Fig. S4, ESI†). Hence, the energy offsets play a prominent role in determining the charge separation efficiency in these material systems, although other factors such as film morphology and material crystallinity might cause some subtle impact on it.8 Especially, in material systems based on wide bandgap donors and low bandgap acceptors as described in this study, the LUMO energy offset is expected to be substantially larger than the HOMO offset, giving rise to more efficient charge generation through the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) pathway and relatively less efficient charge generation through the photo-induced hole transfer (PHT) pathway27 (Fig. 1b, left panel). In the extreme case of donor polymers with sufficiently deepened HOMO levels, blending with an acceptor does not result in obvious hole transfer, indicative of inefficient charge separation at the D/A interface.
As mentioned above, the energy offset can be quantified by measuring the electroluminescence quantum efficiency under the LED operation mode, which involves charge injection into the active layer (Fig. 1b, middle panel). As a result of radiative recombination of injected electrons and holes, electroluminescence from photovoltaic D/A blends has been recognized as a powerful tool to probe the energy of interfacial charge transfer states in OSCs.21,28,29 In blends based on emissive low bandgap materials as described in this study, EL emission from singlet states becomes dominant when the electronic coupling between the local-excited state and ground state is overwhelmingly strong.3,19,20 Under the LED operation mode, the HOMO offset becomes a potential barrier and hole injection will be hindered. Hence, when different polymers with varying HOMO levels are used as electron donors, the corresponding barrier height for hole injection and the subsequent radiative recombination with injected electrons are modulated (Fig. 1b, right panel). In other words, as long as the charge injection from the anode to the polymer is unaffected, as in our case (see Fig. S10, ESI†), the radiative efficiency is indeed an indicator that reflects the potential barrier and thus the energy offset at the D/A interface. Furthermore, any reduction of the radiative efficiency implies additional non-radiative loss, thus decreasing the open-circuit voltage (VOC) for the device, as will be explained below.
The voltage loss associated with photon conversion is given by ΔVOC = Eg/q − VOC, where q is the elementary charge and Eg is the lowest optical bandgap energy of either the donor or acceptor. When comparing the obtained VOC with its radiative limit and the Shockley–Queisser limit, it allows one to categorize the voltage loss into three different types via ΔVOC = ΔVSQOC + ΔVrad,belowgapOC + ΔVnon-radOC, where ΔVSQOC is thermodynamically inevitable as limited by detailed balance between the absorbed and emitted photon in thermal equilibrium, ΔVrad,belowgapOC is a radiative voltage loss, caused by the absorption below the optical gap in an actual device, and ΔVnon-radOC is the voltage loss due to non-radiative recombination.6,21,30 As shown in the literature, ΔVnon-radOC is the dominant voltage loss in many material systems based on non-fullerene acceptors,3,31 and can be quantified by the device radiative efficiency (EQEEL) via:32,33 (1)where q is the elementary charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Fig. 2 summarizes the voltage loss as a function of radiative efficiency as well as ΔVnon-radOC for the material systems used this study (with silicon34 and perovskite35 data taken from the literature), which are grouped together based on the acceptor used. For each low bandgap non-fullerene acceptor, wide bandgap polymers with varied HOMO levels were employed as electron donors (see Table S1 for detailed values and photovoltaic parameters, ESI†). For a fair comparison of voltage losses, the optical bandgaps of the absorbers are determined from the energy of half of the photovoltaic external quantum efficiency (EQEPV) maximum, which are consistent with several physical methods36–38 (Fig. S3, ESI†). As can be clearly seen from Fig. 2, the voltage loss and ΔVnon-radOC are inversely related to EQEEL. Note that for a given low bandgap acceptor, EQEEL increases with the decrease of the energy offset. For example, for the systems based on the blend of the TPD polymers with i-IEICO-4F, as the nominal hole injection barrier height decreases from 0.22 eV (PTH37) to 0.06 eV (PMTT56), the measured EQEEL increases from 2.3 × 10−3% to 2.7 × 10−2%. As a result of the enhanced EQEEL, the non-radiative voltage loss ΔVnon-radOC decreases from 0.28 V (PTH37) to 0.21 V (PMTT56) (Table 1). A similar trend can be observed in the systems based on other acceptors such as IEIO-4F, FOIC, Y6 etc. (photovoltaic parameters and EQEEL values can be found in Table S1, ESI†).

The shaded dash line indicates the lower predicted limit of ΔVOC comprising inevitable radiative voltage loss (ΔVSQOC, approximately 0.28 V for all the devices) and calculated non-radiative voltage loss (ΔVnon-radOC, decreases with increasing EQEEL according to eqn (1), as marked on the top x axis). The distance between the markers (ΔVOC) and the dash line represents the voltage loss induced by absorption broadening due to sub-bandgap states (ΔVrad,belowbapOC). All of the data for OSCs can be found in Table S1 (ESI†), expect the values for crystalline34 silicon and perovskite35 are taken from the literature.

The data shown in brackets are the average values and standard deviations, which are evaluated from over ten independent devices. The optical gap (Eg) is defined as the energy of the half EQEPV maximum from the low bandgap acceptors (Eg,half, see Fig. S3, ESI), from which the voltage loss can be determined through ΔVOC = Eg/q − VOC. The radiative efficiencies (EQEEL) are acquired using a high-sensitivity spectrometer (QE Pro, Ocean Optics), and the non-radiative voltage losses are calculated with eqn (1).

Quantifying the energy offset with EQEEL
The four TPD-based polymer donors, in conjunction with the three i-IEICO-based low bandgap acceptors, provide a 4 × 3 device matrix for this study. As described above, PHT is expected to be less efficient when compared to PET and limits the charge separation in typical non-fullerene OSCs. To quantify the energy offset for PHT, we first investigated the influence of the donor HOMO shift on the EL intensity. The EL intensities of OSCs from different blends, together with that of the corresponding pristine acceptor, are shown in Fig. 3a–c, respectively. In all cases, the EL of the blends is dominated by the emission of the low bandgap acceptor, while emission from the CT states is hardly detectable (see Fig. S6 for the normalized EL spectra, ESI†).
 Fig. 3  (a–d) The EL intensity of blends with different HOMO offsets, the grey dash line denotes the EL intensity of the neat acceptor device. The corresponding EQEEL is labeled in the same color. The devices are forward biased with identical injection current density. The EL intensity of the blend increases when decreasing the HOMO offset, with the EL intensity of the neat acceptor as an upper limit. (e–h) The IQE of the HOMO offset driven PHT process, normalized to that of PET. The normalized IQE in the long wavelength region corresponds to the relative hole transfer efficiency (IQEPHT/IQEPET), which drops significantly with decreasing HOMO offset due to insufficient driving energy. 
Among the three acceptors used in this study, i-IEICO-4F has the lowest HOMO level, thus when blended with any given donor used in this study, i-IEICO-4F can afford the largest HOMO offset, while i-IEICO-2F offers a moderate HOMO offset, followed by i-IEICO. Consistent with the trend of lowering the HOMO by fluorination, the device based on i-IEICO-4F delivers the lowest VOC but highest short-circuit current density (JSC), indicative of high charge separation efficiency, which we discuss in detail below. The device based on i-IEICO-2F shows a moderate JSC and VOC, while the i-IEICO device has the highest VOC but lowest JSC (Table 1). Clearly, this trade-off feature between a small energy offset for high VOC and large energy offset for high JSC appears to be one of the main limitations for OSC performance. While the empirical method relying on individual HOMO levels (i.e., obtained by CV and UPS methods) can correlate the charge separation efficiency with the energy offset to some extent, on the other side, the uncertainty of HOMO levels measured by UPS is inevitable, which could lead to deviations up to 0.1 eV.39 This is obviously larger than the HOMO increment of each material in this study, and thus has the potential to make such correlation ambiguous. For example, the HOMO level difference between i-IEICO and i-IEICO-2F is about 0.04 eV (−5.22 eV vs. −5.26 eV measured by UPS, Fig. 1a).
To overcome this challenge, we use the electroluminescence intensity together with the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) to quantitatively assess the energy offset and charge separation efficiency directly in working devices. The donors and acceptors used in this study possess complementary absorption (Fig. S5, ESI†), thus enabling spectral disentanglement between PET pathways and PHT pathways.27 To visualize the effect of the energy offset on the charge transfer efficiency in the devices, the IQE is used to disentangle the individual contribution from PET and PHT. The original EQEPV and IQE spectra of the devices are provided in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Having ruled out the contribution from absorption, the IQE spectra are product of two major processes: charge separation and charge collection. For this reason, we measure the saturation current density (Jsat) for the devices. We find that the dissociation efficiency (Jsat/JSC), which is believed to correlate with the charge separation efficiency due to field-dependent exciton separation,40,41 decreases with the energy offset. To further clarify the contribution of charge collection, we carry out light intensity dependent JSC and transient photovoltage measurements, and find that the charge collection scenarios are nearly identical for all the studied devices (see Fig. S8 for details, ESI†). Based on our analysis, the IQE should be a suitable tool to reveal the charge separation efficiency of the studied devices. Furthermore, because PHT is less efficient when compared to PET, for each acceptor series the IQE signal due to PHT normalized to that of PET (IQEPHT/IQEPET) reflects the degree of balance between PET and PHT. It can be considered as a direct parameter of the hole transfer efficiency in different blends (Fig. 3e–g).
As can be seen in Fig. 3e, for the polymer:i-IEICO-4F system, regardless of the polymer donor used, the PHT efficiency can rival that of PET, suggesting the HOMO energy level offset suffices to drive hole transfer at the D/A interface. For the polymer:i-IEICO-2F series, with the decrease in the HOMO offset the EQEEL of the blends increases monotonically, approaching that of the pristine i-IEICO-2F when PMT56 is employed as the donor (Fig. 3b). However, as evidenced by Fig. 3f, the PHT of the polymer:i-IEICO-2F series is inferior to that of the i-IEICO-4F based devices, probably due to the accumulation of bound electron–hole pairs in the acceptor and the consequent geminate recombination (Fig. S8, ESI†). As a result, the reduced PHT lowers the overall charge separation efficiency, and is responsible for the decrease in JSC (Table 1).
In the case of the polymer:i-IEICO blend, similar to that observed in the other blends, the EQEEL increases monotonically with a deepening HOMO. It should be noted that the magnitude of this enhancement is less significant as compared to the i-IEICO-2F series, and even less as compared to the i-IEICO-4F series. In addition, the EQEEL of the blends is close to that of the neat acceptor, indicative of a negligible barrier for hole injection and overwhelming electroluminescence from the acceptor. Nevertheless, the small HOMO offset has a pronounced negative impact on the PHT process as shown in Fig. 3g, resulting in a dramatic drop in JSC.

Fig. 3d and h summarize the EQEEL and IQEPHT/IQEPET of different blends as a function of the HOMO offset, respectively. The EQEEL and IQEPHT/IQEPET show opposite trends when the HOMO offset changes, which can be understood in terms of the barrier height for hole injection (Fig. 1b, middle panel) and driving energy for hole transfer (Fig. 1b, left panel), respectively. Besides, the photoluminescence quenching efficiency of the blend films also shows a strong dependence on the HOMO offset (Fig. S9, ESI†), consistent with the trend in the electroluminescence (Fig. 3).
To further verify that the blend EQEEL relative to that of non-fullerene acceptors (namely the EQEEL ratio afterward) can be used to assess the energy offsets at the donor/acceptor interface, we apply the method to other material systems consisting of several state-of-the-art donors and acceptors (PTB7-Th, J52,42 J61,42 J71,43 PBDB-T,13 PBDB-T-2Cl,44 IEICO-4F,45 FOIC,46 PM647 and Y6,47 see Fig. S11 for the structures and Fig. S12 for the HOMO levels, ESI†). The EQEEL and IQEPHT/IQEPET of the devices from the blends based on the IEICO-4F, FOIC and Y6 acceptors are shown in Fig. S13 and S14 (ESI†). Despite the overall structural dispersity, we note that the EQEEL of the blends is enhanced continuously toward that of the acceptor as the HOMO offset decreases in all devices, and is eventually limited by the EQEEL of the low bandgap acceptor. More importantly, the general principle of the increasing EQEEL of the devices relative to that of the low bandgap acceptor with decreasing IQEPHT/IQEPET remains valid. Based on these results, we can conclude that the measurement of EQEEL indeed provides a feasible and reliable method to precisely evaluate the energy offset, and thus confirm the generality of this method in non-fullerene OSCs.
Additional voltage loss associated with a reduced EQEEL ratio
The validation of eqn (1) (Fig. 2) and the observations on the EQEEL of blends and acceptors (Fig. 3) indicate that the non-radiative voltage loss (ΔVnon-radOC) can be further split into two contributions: (2)where q is the elementary charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. EQEEL ratio is the EQEEL ratio between the blend and acceptor, and EQEEL,A is the EQEEL of the neat acceptor. ΔVnr,offsetOC is the additional voltage loss due to the presence of the energy offset, and ΔVnr,AOC is the non-radiative voltage loss due to the non-unity EQEEL of the acceptor itself.

Eqn (2) implies that non-radiative voltage loss can be reduced by decreasing the energy offset or enhancing the radiative efficiency of the low bandgap acceptors. Generally, decreasing the HOMO/LUMO energy offset at the donor/acceptor interface is used to reduce voltage loss and to improve VOC in OSCs.48 However, this strategy also suffers from inefficient charge separation, which restricts the overall efficiency.

Fig. 3d and h illuminate this trade-off by plotting EQEEL (limited by charge injection) and IQEPHT/IQEPET (limited by charge extraction) as a function of energy offset, respectively. Under this circumstance, minimizing the HOMO/LUMO energy offset while still maintaining efficient charge generation could be an effective way to balance the trade-off. However, as we mentioned above, determining the energy offset in an operating device is not straightforward. In order to find the optimal energy offset (or equivalents) required for efficient charge separation, we use the EQEEL ratio as an alternative metric to quantify the energy offsets for organic solar cells.
The relative quantum efficiency (IQEPHT/IQEPET) (Fig. 4a) and the IQE of PHT (Fig. 4b) are plotted against the EQEEL ratio for all the studied devices to reveal that the right compromise needs to be achieved between hole extraction (for higher IQE) and hole injection (for reduced VOC loss). The critical EQEEL ratio, the value at which a transition from the EQEEL ratio-dependent regime (the left shaded area) to the saturated regime occurs (the right dash line), is found to be around 0.1. Below this critical ratio of 0.1, the IQE starts saturating to a maximum value, but at the expense of increasing non-radiative voltage loss due to the energy offset as described by eqn (2) and shown by the top x axis of Fig. 4a and b. In the EQEEL ratio-dependent regime, IQEPHT/IQEPET decreases with the increase of the EQEEL ratio for all material systems, indicating that charge generation is limited by the inadequate energy offset at the D/A interface. This is further underscored by the fact that when the HOMO levels of the donor and acceptor are closely aligned and thus the EQEEL ratio is close to unity, the absolute IQE for PHT dramatically drops to 10–30% (Fig. 4b). The rapid drop of the IQE confirms that efficient charge separation requires an energy level difference, which could be essentially due to the large exciton binding energy in organic materials. Therefore, it is clear that to achieve optimal device performance, an elaborate compromise between photocurrent loss and photovoltage loss is needed, as marked by the oval-shaped area in Fig. 4a. Therefore, Fig. 4a essentially summarizes the requirement for efficient non-fullerene organic solar cells through a figure of merit correlating the balance and efficiency. While this optimal condition could not be intuitively quantified from the energy level offset, however, it corresponds to an EQEEL ratio in the range of about 0.01–0.2 (Fig. 4a). Using eqn (2), this corresponds to a non-radiative voltage loss due to the energy offset (ΔVnr,offsetOC) of 0.04–0.12 V in addition to the intrinsic non-radiative voltage loss due to the non-unity EL efficiency in the pristine acceptor film (ΔVnr,AOC).
 Fig. 4  (a) Relative IQE of PHT(IQEPHT/IQEPET) and (b) absolute IQE value of PHT(IQEPHT) as a function of the EQEEL ratio in blends. The EQEEL ratio between the blend and acceptor gauges the HOMO offset as the PHT driving energy, in which a ratio slightly below unity indicates closely aligned HOMO levels and minimized hole transfer driving energy, whereas a small ratio indicates a large HOMO offset and large driving energy. The top x axis shows the value of additional non-radiative voltage loss induced by the presence of the energy offset, referring to eqn (2), the dash line indicates the proper EQEEL ratio to balance charge separation and voltage loss. (c) Theoretical efficiency limit for ideal and organic solar cells as a function of optical gap (Eg). An ideal solar cell without non-radiative loss can afford an efficiency above 33% (black solid line). An organic bulk heterojunction solar cell with additional non-radiative loss pathways due to the necessity of the charge transfer driving energy shows a maximum efficiency of about 29–31%, given a unity EL efficiency for the neat acceptor (blue and red solid lines). The circles mark the best performing OSCs (PM6:Y6) (PCE ∼16.17%, Fig. S16b, ESI†) and the optimal device in this study (PMT49:i-IEICO-4F, PCE ∼13.0%, Fig. S16a, ESI†), respectively. 
Actually, the EQEEL of most pristine low bandgap non-fullerene acceptors is on the order of 0.1% (see Fig. S15, ESI†), of which the neat i-IEICO-4F film exhibits the highest EQEEL of 0.3%. We note that the EQEEL values are very close to that of crystalline Si (0.5%)34 or perovskite solar cells (∼0.3%),35 implying these non-fullerene acceptor systems have potential in reducing the VOC loss associated with non-radiative recombination.
On the other side, owing to the abovementioned compromise between the photocurrent loss and photovoltage loss for optimal device performance, a relatively larger voltage loss (∼0.59 V) is observed in the best-performing PMT49:i-IEICO-4F device (with an efficiency of around 13%, Fig. S16a, ESI†) and PM6:Y6 device (with an efficiency of 16.17%, Fig. S16b, ESI†). This is consistent with the findings in the literature that most state-of-the-art non-fullerene OSCs reported so far exhibit voltage losses ranging from 0.58 V to 0.70 V.2,47,48 By contrast, crystalline Si shows a relatively smaller loss of 0.43 V,34 and perovskite solar cells show a similar value of 0.46 V.35 And it should be noted that the observed discrepancy can be mainly ascribed to the additional non-radiative voltage loss from the indispensable energy offset (ΔVnr,offsetOC) between the donor and acceptor. In addition, it is not surprising to see that the PMTT56:IEICO-4F system affords the lowest voltage loss of 0.48 eV (Table S1, ESI†) as it has a minimized HOMO offset (corresponding to the highest EQEEL ratio) and a highly emissive acceptor at the same time, despite its inferior efficiency for charge generation (Fig. 4a and b).
Implications of an optimal EQEEL ratio for theoretical efficiency limits
Our study shows that an additional non-radiative voltage loss due to the energy offset (ΔVnr,offsetOC) of 0.04–0.12 V in bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells is inevitable because of the compromise between photocurrent and photovoltage. The additional loss in optimal devices corresponds to an EQEEL ratio in the range of about 0.01–0.2, implying a practical upper limit of 20% for EQEEL in organic solar cells, given the unity radiative efficiency of low bandgap acceptors. With the disclosed limitation underlying the device performance of organic solar cells, we further update the upper limit of their power conversion efficiency.
Considering the Shockley–Queisser limit for an ideal solar cell which has a perfect photoresponse (an EQEPV of 100% above the optical gap and 0% below the gap) and negligible nonradiative recombination (an EQEEL of 100%), the maximum obtainable efficiency is about 33% according to the detailed balance theory.49 Taking into account the unavoidable non-radiative voltage loss (ΔVnr,offsetOC), the highest achievable efficiency in single-junction organic solar cells is in the range of 29% (for an EQEEL of 1%) to 31% (for an EQEEL of 20%) (Fig. 4c). These potential efficiency values are very similar to those derived from other solar cell technologies, and much higher than previously expected for fullerene based OSCs.50 Here, we attribute this discrepancy to the minimized driving energy required for charge separation51 and the improved radiative efficiency for non-fullerene acceptors.
In pursuing high efficiency, although the best device performance was achieved under optimal conditions which correspond to a critical EQEEL ratio (Fig. 4a), there still exists much potential for improvement towards the upper limit (Fig. 4c). It is worthy of note that the EQEEL of these state-of-the-art devices is on the order of 0.01%, which is mainly limited by the inferior radiative efficiency (∼0.1%) of low bandgap acceptors and thus far below 1%. Therefore, if it is possible to enhance the radiative efficiency of low band gap acceptors through molecular design in the future, power conversion efficiencies of OSCs approaching the predicted upper limit might be possible. Moreover, designing molecules that require smaller energy offsets (e.g., by increasing the dielectric constant of the active layer) would slightly increase the critical EQEEL ratio (as well as the predicted upper limit) and thus could also be a viable pathway to improve the efficiency.
Our study clearly indicates that there is still substantial potential for boosting the efficiency in OSCs by enhancing the intrinsic radiative efficiency of low bandgap acceptors and further optimizing the energy offset with our approach, because the non-radiative voltage loss of the present devices has a significant portion in the overall energy loss as compared to the SQ limit value.
Conclusion
In summary, we propose an alternative method of measuring the radiative efficiency ratio between an actual photovoltaic device and the emissive device based on the pure acceptor to evaluate the energy offset at the donor/acceptor interface in non-fullerene acceptor based organic solar cells. This method can provide some useful perspectives to reach a rational overall optimum for non-fullerene acceptor systems, where the empirical threshold value of ∼0.3 eV for efficient charge separation is no longer applicable, or for bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells where evaluation of the energy offset from the HOMO/LUMO energy levels for individual donors and acceptors is difficult. We find that the EQEEL of the photovoltaic device is modulated by the energy offset, and reaches its upper limit set by the radiative efficiency of the acceptor when the energy offset is sufficiently small.
Considering that emerging non-fullerene acceptors can afford EQEEL up to 0.3%, the lowest voltage loss in these systems can be as low as 0.48 V when the HOMO offset is small. However, such a small HOMO offset usually leads to inferior charge separation, thus lowering the overall efficiency in these devices. A critical EQEEL ratio of 0.1 was empirically derived: charge separation remains efficient when the EQEEL ratio is below this threshold, but drops significantly when the ratio is above. To achieve optimal performance, by matching the donor and acceptor and/or chemical modification, the EQEEL ratio of blend devices should be tuned to the critical EQEEL ratio, which corresponds to an optimal energy offset that minimizes non-radiative voltage loss while maintaining efficient charge generation.
Methods
Materials
The synthesis of thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (TPD)-based wide bandgap semiconducting polymers was reported elsewhere,24 while i-IEICO and its fluorinated derivatives i-IEICO-2F and i-IEICO-4F were synthesized according to the procedure given in the literature.22,23 Polymer donor PM6 and small molecular acceptor Y6 were purchased from Solarmer, and donor PTB7-Th was purchased from 1-Material. Other donors and acceptors used in this study (J52,42 J61,42 J71,43 PBDB-T,13 PBDB-T-2Cl,44 IEICO-4F,45 and FOIC46) were synthesized in the lab according to the literature.
Device fabrication
An inverted device architecture of ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/active layer (∼80 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm) was employed for all the photovoltaic cells in this study. The active layers were prepared from 20 mg ml−1 chlorobenzene (CB) solutions, where the D:A mass ratio was maintained at 1:1. As an exception, FOIC and Y6 based devices were deposited from 12 mg ml−1 and 16 mg ml−1 solutions in chloroform (CF) with a 1:1 mass ratio. All active layers were as cast without further treatment. For the optimized PMT49:i-IEICO-4F devices, 1.0% volume of diphenyl ether (DPE) was added into the solution as an additive, and the active layers were thermally annealed at 100 °C after spin coating. The single component devices have the same device architecture as the blend devices, where the pristine films were prepared from solutions with lower concentration (10 mg ml−1 for polymer donors, 15 mg ml−1 for acceptors) to obtain a thickness of about 60 nm. The devices were encapsulated with epoxy resin and tested in ambient conditions.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS)
Samples for UPS measurements were prepared by spin-coating donor or acceptor solution (10 mg ml−1 for polymer donors, 15 mg ml−1 for acceptors) onto ITO-coated glass substrates. The samples were then transferred into the ultrahigh vacuum chamber of an ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer (K-ALPHA+, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The UPS signals were obtained at a working pressure of 5 × 10−9 mbar with a He I source (21.22 eV, sample bias −5 V).
Device characterization
Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and photovoltaic parameters were collected using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G illumination from a SAN-EI solar simulator (Model: XES-40S1). The light intensity was corrected using a NREL certified mono-crystal silicon reference cell (Hamamatsu S1133, with a KG-5 visible color filter) with spectral mismatch accounted for. The device area was defined as 4.5 mm2 and 16 mm2 by a laser cut mask. EQEPV and IQE spectra were acquired using an integrated spectral response measurement system (QE-3011, Enlitech Inc.), equipped with a standard silicon cell to calibrate the light source and a small integrating sphere to record the reflectivity. The device test environment is as follows: 25+/2.5 °C, 30% humidity in ambient air. The voltage scan conditions are from −0.2 V to 1.2 V, with a step of 0.01 V, 10 ms delay. All of the devices were encapsulated with epoxy. The absorption spectra were measured using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV3600, SHIMADZU). The photoluminescence spectra of the blend and neat films were recorded under constant excitation using a Flurorolog-3 (HORIBA) spectrometer. The photoluminescence quantum yield was measured independently using an absolute PL quantum yield spectrometer Quantaurus-QY (Hamamatsu, C11347-11).
Electroluminescence experiments
For electroluminescence (EL) measurements, the blend and single component devices were forward biased using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit with 50 mA steady current injection, if not stated otherwise. The large injection current compensates morphology or trap induced non-radiative processes, and reveals the potential radiative capability of the materials. The emitted photons were captured by a standard lamp calibrated high-sensitivity spectrometer (QE Pro, Ocean Optics) equipped with a cooled Hamamatsu CCD array. The number of photons collected by a light guide or detector is highly sensitive to the distance and incident angle; we used a customized tiny integrating sphere to collect emitted photons in all directions while maintaining the incident EL intensity as high possible. A reference lamp was also employed to calibrate the set-up. The electroluminescence external quantum efficiency (EQEEL) was calculated as wavelength integrated photons divided by injected electrons. Small molecule acceptors tend to aggregate in neat films; the acceptor films used in the EL experiment need to be uniform and free of pinholes to ensure correct determination of EQEEL.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs), which comprise organic semiconducting donor and acceptor materials, have shown promise as a low-cost renewable energy source. Recently, the power conversion efficiency of OSCs has skyrocketed from around 10 to more than 16% because of the distinctive advantages of non-fullerene small molecular acceptors (SMAs). The successful implantation of SMAs in OSCs has greatly reduced the energy offset required between the donor and acceptor to drive photon-to-electron conversion, resulting in improved energy usage in these devices. Although it is recognized that the energy offset plays a decisive role in the operation of OSCs, the accurate evaluation of the offset in different donor/acceptor systems remains challenging because of the used empirical methods based on electronic orbital energy measurements. In this contribution, we propose an electroluminescence efficiency measurement approach to be a reliable way to probe the energy offset directly from a working device. Our study on extensive non-fullerene systems gives an optimal energy offset that can properly balance charge generation and voltage loss. Based on the findings, we conclude our work could provide guidelines for future SMA design and energy offset optimization.

 	Fig. 2  The overall voltage loss (ΔVOC) as a function of radiative efficiency (EQEEL) in different non-fullerene devices. The shaded dash line indicates the lower predicted limit of ΔVOC comprising inevitable radiative voltage loss (ΔVSQOC, approximately 0.28 V for all the devices) and calculated non-radiative voltage loss (ΔVnon-radOC, decreases with increasing EQEEL according to eqn (1), as marked on the top x axis). The distance between the markers (ΔVOC) and the dash line represents the voltage loss induced by absorption broadening due to sub-bandgap states (ΔVrad,belowbapOC). All of the data for OSCs can be found in Table S1 (ESI†), expect the values for crystalline34 silicon and perovskite35 are taken from the literature.

 	Fig. 3  (a–d) The EL intensity of blends with different HOMO offsets, the grey dash line denotes the EL intensity of the neat acceptor device. The corresponding EQEEL is labeled in the same color. The devices are forward biased with identical injection current density. The EL intensity of the blend increases when decreasing the HOMO offset, with the EL intensity of the neat acceptor as an upper limit. (e–h) The IQE of the HOMO offset driven PHT process, normalized to that of PET. The normalized IQE in the long wavelength region corresponds to the relative hole transfer efficiency (IQEPHT/IQEPET), which drops significantly with decreasing HOMO offset due to insufficient driving energy.

 	Fig. 4  (a) Relative IQE of PHT(IQEPHT/IQEPET) and (b) absolute IQE value of PHT(IQEPHT) as a function of the EQEEL ratio in blends. The EQEEL ratio between the blend and acceptor gauges the HOMO offset as the PHT driving energy, in which a ratio slightly below unity indicates closely aligned HOMO levels and minimized hole transfer driving energy, whereas a small ratio indicates a large HOMO offset and large driving energy. The top x axis shows the value of additional non-radiative voltage loss induced by the presence of the energy offset, referring to eqn (2), the dash line indicates the proper EQEEL ratio to balance charge separation and voltage loss. (c) Theoretical efficiency limit for ideal and organic solar cells as a function of optical gap (Eg). An ideal solar cell without non-radiative loss can afford an efficiency above 33% (black solid line). An organic bulk heterojunction solar cell with additional non-radiative loss pathways due to the necessity of the charge transfer driving energy shows a maximum efficiency of about 29–31%, given a unity EL efficiency for the neat acceptor (blue and red solid lines). The circles mark the best performing OSCs (PM6:Y6) (PCE ∼16.17%, Fig. S16b, ESI†) and the optimal device in this study (PMT49:i-IEICO-4F, PCE ∼13.0%, Fig. S16a, ESI†), respectively.
