    , Accepted 31st May 2020First published on 2nd June 2020AbstractWith an absorption edge as far as 690 nm, SrNbO2N holds great promise for solar energy conversion. However, very poor photocatalytic activity is generally seen for SrNbO2N, limiting its practical applications as a photocatalyst. In this work, SrNbO2N is modified by introducing Zr at B sites, i.e. SrNb1−xZrxO2+yN1−y (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), which are then investigated as photocatalysts for water oxidation reactions. Zr modification not only induces porous microstructures and inhibits the formation of Nb4+ defects, but it also ameliorates the surface hydrophilicity of SrNbO2N. Clear improvements in photocatalytic water oxidation have been realized after Zr modification and an apparent quantum efficiency of as high as 1.44% has been achieved. Further analysis of the band edge alignments suggests that Zr modification positively shifts the valence band edge of SrNbO2N, which favors water oxidation reactions.
1. Introduction
Our modern economy's ever-growing demand for energy is unlikely to be fulfilled by the limited fossil-fuel reservoirs in the planet, let alone tackling the difficult problems of environmental degradation that accompany fossil fuel consumption.1–4 In this context, it is of great urgency to search for and develop clean and renewable energy resources as alternatives to fossil fuels. Chemical fuels produced by solar energy, in particular solar hydrogen production by photocatalytically splitting water, has been considered as an ideal technique for this purpose.5–10 This largely arises from the fact that solar insolation is virtually infinite and widely distributed and hydrogen is a clean energy vector that will help to decarbonize our energy infrastructure.11,12
Conventional stable photocatalysts are generally wide band gap semiconductors, the light absorption ranges of which do not match well with the solar spectrum.13 They may also suffer from poor charge separation conditions that dissipate most photo-generated charges.14 Recently, oxynitrides with a perovskite structure, e.g. A2+/3+M4+/5+(O,N)3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, La; B = Nb, Ta, Ti) have attracted a great deal of attention as potential photocatalysts for solar water splitting.15–21 This is not only due to their strong visible light absorption, suitable band edge alignments and good chemical robustness for the water redox reaction but also due to their good dielectric properties that favor charge separation.22–27 For instance, SrNbO2N has a light absorption edge of as far as 690 nm (Eg ∼ 1.8 eV) and has a high dielectric constant of 25000 at room temperature.26,28,29 As the exciton (photo-generated e–h pairs) binding energy is inversely proportional to the square of the dielectric constant,30i.e. (where m* is the reduced effective mass of ; e is the elemental charge; εr is the relative dielectric constant and h is Planck's constant), SrNbO2N would have much better charge separation conditions than most conventional semiconductors, such as TiO2 (εr ∼ 45)31 or ZnO (εr ∼ 8).32
However, pristine SrNbO2N does not show satisfactory photocatalytic activity for water splitting under ordinary conditions.33–35 This has been attributed to a high density of defects (e.g. Nb4+) produced during the synthesis procedures (high-temperature ammonolysis) that induce fast charge recombination within this compound.33,36 How to reduce the density of defects is critical to achieving efficient solar water splitting with this promising compound. In this work, we have modified SrNbO2N by introducing Zr to the B sites, i.e. SrNb1−xZrxO2+yN1−y (0 ≤ x ≤ 1). The presence of Zr at B sites not only helps to reduce the density of Nb4+ defects but also improves the surface hydrophilicity of SrNbO2N, which in turn, contributes to high photocatalytic activity for water oxidation under visible light illumination.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials synthesis
Zr modified SrNbO2N, i.e. SrNb1−xZrxO2+yN1−y (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), was prepared by ammonolysis of suitable metal oxide precursors at high temperature. The metal oxide precursors were produced using a standard polymerized complex (PC) method. In a typical synthesis of a precursor for SrNb0.2Zr0.8O2+yN1−y (x = 0.8), 0.2940 g of niobium chloride (Aladdin, 99%) was dissolved to make a clear solution containing 12.1 mL of ethylene glycol (Aladdin, GC grade) and 10.4520 g of citric acid (Aladdin, 99.5%). Subsequently, 1.1400 g of strontium nitrate (SCR, 99.5%) and 1.8500 g of zirconium nitrate (Zr(NO3)4·5H2O, Macklin, 99%) were added into the above solution. After fully dissolving all reagents, the solution was heated on a hotplate at 573 K until a brown resin formed. The resin was calcined at 823 K for 10 h to remove any organic components. The resultant white powder was amorphous according to XRD analysis. The amorphous powder was used as a precursor for further ammonolysis. For the ammonolysis experiment, about 0.2 g of precursor powder was placed in an alumina boat and transferred into a tube furnace. The powder was calcined at 1123 K for 10 h under a flow of ammonia (flow rate: 300 mL min−1) (Jiaya Chemicals, 99.9999%). The resultant powder was washed sequentially with diluted hydrochloric acid and deionized water three times and denoted asSrNb0.2Zr0.8O2+yN1−y (x = 0.8). Other samples with different Zr content were prepared under the same procedures using different amounts of zirconium nitrate in the initial step.
2.2 Materials characterization
Powders of SrNb1−xZrxO2+yN1−y (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) were subjected to a number of analytical techniques. First, the structure and phase purity were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques on a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer (Bruker, Germany). The incident radiation was Cu Kα1 (λ = 1.5406 Å) and Cu Kα2 (λ = 1.5444 Å) with a ratio of 2 to 1. The step size for data collection was 0.02° and the duration time of each step was 0.2 s. The General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) software package was applied to perform XRD Rietveld refinement.37 Optical properties were evaluated with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (JASCO-V750), which was equipped with an integrating sphere. The data were collected in diffuse reflectance mode over a spectral range from 200 to 900 nm. BaSO4 was used as a non-absorbing standard material. A field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S4800, Japan) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100, Japan) were used to examine the microstructures of the as-prepared samples. The nitrogen content and the thermal stability of the freshly prepared samples were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on a Labsys evo system (France) over a range from 298 to 1473 K at a heating/cooling rate of 10 K min−1. The surface area of the as-prepared samples was investigated using a Micromeritics Tristar 3020 instrument and calculated based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller model. Before testing, all samples were heated at 473 K for 2 h under vacuum so that gas adsorbed on the surface could be removed. The surface conditions and valence band of the as-prepared samples were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo Escalab 250, monochromatic Al Kα source). All binding energies were corrected using the C 1s peak at 284.7 eV as the reference point.38 XPS data were fitted using XPSPeak41 software with Gaussian–Lorentzian functions (Lorentzian weighting of 20%) and a Shirley-type background. Dynamic water contact angle measurements were taken using a software-controlled video-based wetting angle meter (Data Physics Instruments GmbH, Filderstadt, Germany).
2.3 Photocatalytic water oxidation
The photocatalytic properties of SrNbO2N before and after Zr modification were evaluated by comparing their oxygen production in the presence of a sacrificial agent under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 400 nm). These experiments were performed in a top-irradiation type vessel connected to a gas-closed circulation and evacuation system (Perfect Light, Labsolar-IIIAG). The sample powders were deposited with CoOx as a cocatalyst to facilitate the water oxidation reaction. This was done using a thermal deposition method according to previous literature:39,40 100 mg of the as-prepared sample powders were ultrasonically dispersed into cobalt nitrate aqueous solution to form suspensions. The suspensions were then dried at 373 K in air for 1 h, calcined at 973 K under ammonia flow (300 mL min−1) for 1 h and re-calcined again at 473 K in air for a further 1 h. The CoOx deposited sample powders and 0.2 g of La2O3 (pH mediator at ca. 8.5) were ultrasonically dispersed into 100 mL of silver nitrate aqueous solution (0.05 M), which were then sealed in the reactor. The reactor was evacuated for 45 min to remove dissolved air. A water jacket with circulating water flow was used to keep the reactor temperature at around 293 K. Visible light illumination was generated using a xenon lamp (Perfect Light, PLX-SXE300) equipped with a UV cutoff filter (λ ≥ 400 nm). The gas component within the reactor was examined with an online gas chromatograph (GC) (TECHCOMP, GC7900) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and 5 Å molecular sieve columns. Pure Ar was used as the carrier gas. Cyclical oxygen evolution experiments were performed in a similar setup except using Na2S2O8 aqueous solution (0.05 M) as a sacrificial agent. For apparent quantum efficiency determination, monochromatic light was also generated by filtering the output of a xenon lamp (Perfect Light, PLX-SXE300) with a bandpass filter (Perfect Light) at 420, 450, 500, 550 and 600 nm, respectively. The photon flux of the lamp at individual monochromatic light wavelengths was determined with a quantum meter (Apogee MP-300). The apparent quantum efficiency was then determined using the following equation: (1)where n = 4 for oxygen production, ng is the moles of gas production per hour, np is the moles of photon flux per hour.
2.4 Mott–Schottky analysis
Mott–Schottky analysis was performed based on electrodes fabricated using the sample powders. Sample powders were deposited onto fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (1 × 3 cm) as the electrodes. This was done using an electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method.41 In brief, suspensions formed by dispersing 50 mg of finely ground sample powders and 10 mg of iodine in 50 mL of acetone were used for deposition. Two pieces of FTO glass were placed in parallel into the above suspensions with their conductive sides facing inward. The distance between them was about 1 cm. A constant 10 V bias was applied between the FTO glasses for 3 minutes using a potentiostat (Keithley 2450 Source Meter). FTO glass at the anode side deposited with sample powder was therefore used as the electrode. The electrode was calcined at 673 K under nitrogen flow for 1 h to remove any remaining iodine. A few drops of titanium tetrachloride (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%) alcohol solution (10 mM) were added onto the electrode, which was then heated at 623 K for 15 minutes. We repeated the above steps 6 times to avoid exposure of the naked FTO and facilitate particle interconnections.42 A Zahner electrochemical workstation connected to a three-electrode configuration setup was used to perform the analysis. The as-prepared electrode, platinum foil (1 × 1 cm) and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. K3PO4/K2HPO4 solution (0.1 M, pH = 12.66) was used as an electrolyte and a buffer solution. The capacitance was extracted from impedance data at 1000 Hz with 10 mV amplitude.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural changes after Zr modification
The successful incorporation of Zr into SrNbO2N, i.e. SrNb1−xZrxO2+yN1−y (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis. Fig. 1 illustrates the XRD patterns of freshly prepared sample powders with different Zr content. All patterns closely resemble the standard patterns of SrNbO2N (JCPDS: 01-078-1458), indicative of single phase formation. There is, however, successive shifting of all reflections towards low angles in response to Zr uptake (Fig. 1, right-hand plot), suggesting gradual expansion of the unit cell as a result of Zr modification. This can be rationalized by Vegard's law, as Nb cations are replaced by larger Zr cations in the perovskite structure (ionic radii: Nb5+ ∼ 0.64 Å; Zr4+ ∼ 0.72 Å in octahedral coordination).43,44 This can be further supported by the unit cell parameters determined by Rietveld refinement (Fig. 1b). All unit cell parameters increase monotonically with incorporation of Zr and a watershed point at x = 0.8 is noted where the structure changes from tetrahedral to orthorhombic symmetry. The detailed unit cell parameters and typical refined XRD patterns are tabulated in Table 1 and plotted in Fig. 2. Such structural changes probably originate from an alteration in the tilt of the Nb(O,N)6 octahedra. For instance, an anti-phase tilt of Nb(O,N)6 octahedra along [100] is maintained up to x = 0.8 but changes to an in-phase tilt at x = 1.0.45

3.2. Microstructures
Sample powders of SrNb1−xZrxO2+yN1−y (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) were then inspected under a microscope. Fig. 3 displays typical field emission scanning electron microscopic (FESEM) images of all of the sample powders. Pristine SrNbO2N contains a dense agglomeration of particles with a particle size of around 100 nm. Introducing Zr clearly modifies these microstructures, as particles become loosely contacted with porous structures. This explains the much increased surface area in Zr modified SrNbO2N (Table 1). It is known that Zr is highly refractory, thereby hindering particle intergrowth during high-temperature ammonolysis.46,47 These porous microstructures are highly beneficial for photocatalysis as they facilitate mass transport during photocatalytic reactions. Further elemental mapping analysis confirms the homogeneous distribution of all elements across the sample particles (Fig. S3†) and TEM analysis indicates the porous nature of these particles with high crystallinity (Fig. S4†). It is worth mentioning that the color of the sample powders is strongly correlated with the Zr content, as can be seen from their digital photographs (Fig. 3g). Pristine SrNbO2N has a nearly black color with a reddish hue. It changes consecutively to dark brown, dark orange, yellow, light yellow and becomes almost white as x varies from 0.2 to 1.0. Such clear color changes indicate substantial alterations to visible light absorption, as can be seen in the following section.

3.3. Light absorption
The light absorption of SrNb1−xZrxO2+yN1−y (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) is evaluated with their UV-Vis light absorption spectra. Fig. 4a illustrates their absorption curves which are converted from diffuse-reflectance spectra. Pristine SrNbO2N shows intense absorption across UV, visible and up to infrared regions, being consistent with its black color. It has been pointed out that the strong absorption tail above its absorption edge (λ ≥ 650 nm) arises from various types of defects, such as Nb4+ species.33 These defects often serve as charge trapping centers and promote charge recombination. It is clear from Fig. 4a that such an absorption tail is gradually damped along with Zr modification, indicating a decrease in defect concentration in the presence of Zr. This phenomenon might be rationalized by the inductive effect of Zr on the Nb–O/N bonds:48 Zr is less electron-negative or more electron-donating than Nb.49 Therefore, partially replacing Nb with Zr increases the covalency of neighboring Nb–O/N bonds. The net effect is to increase the crystal field around Nb, which stabilizes Nb in its high oxidation state. In addition to a lower absorption tail, Zr modification also blue-shifts the absorption edge of SrNbO2N, which can be attributed to the reduced N content according to TGA analysis (Fig. S1†). This probably stems from a charge balance requirement that increases O content in the structure, i.e.. The accurate band gap for most Zr modified SrNbO2N is difficult to calculate using Kubelka–Munk transformations as absorption by defects strongly interferes with the absorption edge. Nevertheless, enlargement of the band gap along with Zr modification can be inferred qualitatively.

3.4. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS)
The elemental distribution and surface conditions were examined using XPS techniques. Fig. 5 illustrates the XPS spectra of core-level electrons for the constituent elements. XPS of other samples can be found in the ESI (Fig. S2†). For the Nb 3d state, four overlapping peaks can be resolved for pristine SrNbO2N at around 204.9, 207.9, 206.5 and 209.4 eV. These peaks can be assigned to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 states of Nb4+ and Nb5+ species,50 respectively. The presence of Nb4+ species is consistent with previous expectations. However, the peaks for Nb4+ species decrease after Zr modification and are absent for x ≥ 0.4 (Fig. S2†), verifying the usefulness of Zr in inhibiting Nb4+ species. The O 1s state contains two overlapping peaks centered at around 529.8 and 531.5 eV, assignable to lattice oxygen (O2−) and hydroxyl groups (OH−).51 The clear increase in the latter peak after Zr modification implies an improved surface hydrophilicity. This is confirmed by the water contact angle measurements (Fig. 6). A much smaller water contact angle for SrNb0.2Zr0.8O2+yN1−y (x = 0.8) compared to SrNbO2N (x = 0.0) suggests a more hydrophilic surface after Zr modification. The N 1s state for SrNbO2N (x = 0.0) involves a broad peak at around 396 eV. This peak decreases quickly along with Zr content, being in a good accord with TGA analysis in which Zr modification decreases N content. The presence of Zr in the structure is supported by two overlapping peaks centered at 181.6 and 184.0 eV, which can be attributed to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 states of the Zr4+ species.52 The trend in the peak intensities is consistent with the Zr content in the structure.

3.5 Photocatalytic activity
The photocatalytic activity of SrNbO2N before and after Zr modification was assessed by comparing their oxygen production in the presence of a sacrificial agent under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 400 nm). Cocatalyst CoOx was loaded onto sample powders to promote water oxidation reactions. The importance of water oxidation reactions can be realized from the involvement of four electrons and four protons, and are considered as the rate-limiting step for water splitting.53 To exclude any spontaneous reactions that may lead to oxygen evolution, control experiments were conducted first with one of the following components missing: sample powders, light illumination, water etc. No oxygen was detected under these conditions, ruling out any spontaneous oxygen evolution reactions. In contrast, oxygen signals were detected when sample powders were illuminated, confirming real photocatalytic reactions. The temporal photocatalytic O2 evolution profiles are shown in Fig. 7a. SrNbO2N (x = 0.0) exhibits only mild O2 evolution under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 400 nm), in good agreement with a previous report.33 However, this situation is clearly improved after Zr modification. In particular, SrNb0.2Zr0.8O2+yN1−y (x = 0.8) produced nearly twice as much O2 as SrNbO2N (x = 0.0) in the same period of time, highlighting the usefulness of Zr modification. Nevertheless, low activity for O2 production was also noticed at low (x = 0.2) and high (x = 1.0) Zr content. This probably stems from a compromise between defect density and visible light absorption, as they both decrease along with Zr modification. The photocatalytic performance was further investigated by varying the amount of cocatalyst CoOx loaded (Fig. 7b). An optimal loading point at 1 wt% was found for SrNb0.2Zr0.8O2+yN1−y (x = 0.8), which was also chosen for cyclical testing and action spectra analysis. Cyclical oxygen evolution testing is shown in Fig. S5a. SrNb0.2Zr0.8O2+yN1−y (x = 0.8) demonstrates almost no degradation for photocatalytic oxygen evolution, and XRD analysis indicates no structural changes before and after the experiments (Fig. S5b†), confirming the good stability of this compound. The action spectra (i.e. AQE vs. excitation wavelength) of SrNb0.2Zr0.8O2+yN1−y (x = 0.8) are illustrated in Fig. 7c where its UV-Vis absorption spectra are also included. The AQE of SrNb0.2Zr0.8O2+yN1−y (x = 0.8) reveals a clear dependence on the excitation wavelength that matches its UV-Vis absorption spectra well. Therefore, it is indeed a photon-driven process. An AQE of as high as 1.44% has been achieved at 420 ± 20 nm, suggesting good photocatalytic activity after Zr modification. The AQE obtained in this work is comparable to or better than those of many active oxynitrides reported in the literature (Table S1†).

3.6. Band edge alignment
The impact of Zr modification on the band edge positions has also been investigated. This was carried out using Mott–Schottky (MS) analysis in combination with an XPS valence band scan. MS plots of SrNbO2N (x = 0.0) and SrNb0.2Zr0.8O2+yN1−y (x = 0.8) are shown in Fig. 8a where both compounds have a positive slope, indicating n-type semiconductivity. Their flat band potential (Fermi level under flat band conditions) is deduced from extrapolating the linear part of the MS curves and read to be −0.82 V and −1.00 V vs. NHE for SrNbO2N (x = 0.0) and SrNb0.2Zr0.8O2+yN1−y (x = 0.8), respectively. On the other hand, the XPS valence band scan suggests their valence band edges are 1.80 eV and 2.07 eV more positive than the Fermi level of SrNbO2N (x = 0.0) and SrNb0.2Zr0.8O2+yN1−y (x = 0.8), respectively. Considering their band gaps (1.8 eV for SrNbO2N and 2.2 eV for SrNb0.2Zr0.8O2+yN1−y (x = 0.8)), their band edge alignments can be deduced, and are schematically plotted in Fig. 8c. It can be seen from Fig. 8c that a positive shift in the valence band edge and a negative shift of the conduction band edge occur for SrNbO2N after Zr modification. This could be another reason for the better photocatalytic O2 production as holes in SrNb0.2Zr0.8O2+yN1−y (x = 0.8) have a higher oxidation power than those in SrNbO2N (x = 0.0). The positive shift of the valence band is probably related to the decrease in the N content in the structure, as N 2p orbitals make a greater contribution to the top of the valence band.

4. Conclusions
SrNbO2N has been modified by introducing Zr at its B sites. The perovskite structure of SrNbO2N was maintained after Zr modification with slight unit cell expansions. The presence of Zr in SrNbO2N induces porous microstructures, inhibits Nb4+ defect formation, improves surface hydrophilicity and, more importantly, enhances photocatalytic activity for water oxidation reactions. An AQE as high as 1.44% has been achieved at 420 ± 20 nm for SrNb0.2Zr0.8O2+yN1−y (x = 0.8). Zr modification is also responsible for a positive shift of the valence band edge, which may also contribute to the improved photocatalytic activity.
