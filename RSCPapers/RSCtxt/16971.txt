    , Accepted 24th September 2018First published on 27th September 2018AbstractIn this work, an anode material with improved thermal stability, charge capacity, charge capacity retention, energy density, cyclic performance, operation safety, reversible capacity, and rate capability was synthesized for battery applications. The graphene-magnetite-polyaniline (Gr-Fe3O4-PANI) nanocomposites (NCs) are believed to deliver outstanding performance owing to the collective effect of the layered graphene (Gr) and magnetite (Fe3O4) hollow rods (HRs), as well as the better conductivity of polyaniline (PANI). The Gr-Fe3O4-PANI NCs easily enable the insertion and deinsertion of Li+, the passage of ions in the electrode, fast kinetics of Li+, and low volume expansion. Gr-Fe3O4-PANI NC was prepared by polymerizing aniline in the presence of already prepared Fe3O4 HRs, then dispersing in Gr. Fe3O4 HRs were synthesized by a hydrothermal route. Electrochemical properties were investigated by galvanostatic charge–discharge analysis and cyclic voltammetry. A lithium-ion battery (LIB) based on the Gr-Fe3O4-PANI exhibited a superior reversible current capacity of 1214 mA h g−1, excellent power capability, low volume expansion, high cycling stability and 99.6% coulombic efficiency over 250 cycles.
1 Introduction
Rechargeable batteries are in high demand today and used in nearly all aspects of life, including power tools, electronics, transport, and medical devices; they are also used for storing electricity produced by renewable sources such as solar, wind, and tidal energy.1–5 The technology is improving continuously, with an increase in energy density and decrease in charging time.6 It is very likely that with greater understanding of nanotechnology, batteries will play a pivotal role in the next major wave of innovations.7,8 Improvements facilitated by nanotechnology can offer a new lease on life for existing battery materials and may further develop some new materials which have not yet been considered.9,10 The major motivation for the research in batteries is to find suitable electrodes having a higher surface area, which in turn allows free flow of charge as well as higher capacity and more charge/discharge cycles.11,12
LIBs are lightweight, environmentally friendly, high-energy and have high power density, thus gaining a lot of attention.13 The nanomaterials which have the higher storage density of lithium as compared to the standard graphite and metal electrodes include the carbon nanotubes, carbon-coated silicon nanowires, LiMn2O4 or LiCo2O4 nanoparticles, and layered nanostructured vanadium oxide.14,15 Manganese oxide, ZrO2, SiO2, or Al2O3 nanoparticles, when added to the solid polymer gel, can considerably improve the storage and conductivity of the electrolyte.16 As the liquid electrolytes used in Li-ion batteries can rupture the cell when overheated and induce combustion, safety in batteries is an important issue.17,18 Polymer gel electrolytes reduce or eliminate the chance of a short circuit by replacing liquid electrolytes. Solid ceramics have the advantage of high-temperature resistance and suit the requirements of higher stress applications such as renewable power stations and large vehicles.19 Researchers are doing a lot of work to develop an efficient electrode material and electrolyte for LIBs, which is still a challenging task.20,21 Furthermore, lower levels of thermal stability, specific capacity of the electrode, and energy conversion efficiency remain to be overcome.22
Due to these reasons, developing a high energy density battery requires a high-capacity electrode material. In LIBs, the anode is generally made of graphene, but it suffers from the very low theoretical capacity of 370 mA h g−1.23,24 Fe3O4 has a high theoretical capacity of 926 mA h g−1 and is environmentally safe, low cost, and naturally abundant. These properties of Fe3O4 make it a potential anode material for LIBs. However, the limited long-term cycling stability and rate capability of Fe3O4-based electrodes, mainly caused by the large structural-volume change and slow electrochemical kinetics, severely hinder their practical application.25 PANI has a specific capacitance of 742 mA h g−1, high thermal stability, low volume expansion and high chemical resistance. These properties make it useful for improving the electrochemical applications of Fe3O4 in LIB applications.26
Therefore, the growing demands of high energy density LIBs can be fulfilled by exploring alternative anode materials. Due to aggregation of cell material, poor conductivity, large volume changes of electrode material, and electrode degradation during lithiation, the specific capacity of LIBs suddenly fades. Therefore, hollow rods of Fe3O4 were synthesized by a hydrothermal route, and then aniline was polymerized in the presence of Fe3O4 HRs to prepare the excellent electrode material Gr-Fe3O4-PANI for LIBs.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Ferrous chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2·4H2O, 98%, Sigma), ferric chloride hexahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 98.5%, Fluka), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, ≥97%, Merck), waterborne polyurethane (WPU, 48%, SRC), N-methyl pyrrolidinone (C5H9NO, 99%, Merck), graphene nanosheets (Gr, 99%, Merck), ammonium persulfate (APS, 99.5%, Fluka), lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6, 98%, Uni-chem), aniline (C6H5NH2, 98%, Fluka), and double distilled water were used for the synthesis of Gr-Fe3O4-PANI nanocomposite.
2.2. Synthesis of magnetite (Fe3O4) HRs
The Fe3O4 HRs were prepared by using a facile hydrothermal method. In a typical synthesis procedure, 1 mmol FeSO4·7H2O and 2 mmol Fe(NO3)3·9H2O salt were dissolved in 30 mL of distilled water. To this mixture, 9 mmol NaOH was added at 5 °C under constant magnetic stirring to ensure good dispersion of the reactants. After 10 min, the solution was placed into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, and the temperature was maintained at 80 °C for 24 h. After cooling down, black Fe3O4 HRs were removed from the solution and washed thoroughly with distilled water, then with ethanol. Finally, the Fe3O4 HRs were dried at 60 °C for 10 h in an oven for further characterizations.27 Experimental conditions and composition of Fe3O4 HRs are given in Table 1.

2.3. Polyaniline surface modified Fe3O4 NPs (Fe3O4-PANI)
Fe3O4-PANI HRs were prepared by the facile in situ polymerization of aniline in the presence of Fe3O4 NPs. In brief, aniline (2 g, 21.5 mmol) and Fe3O4 HRs (6 g, 63 mmol) were dispersed in aqueous solution (110 mL) of 0.2 M HCl at 5 °C. Ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8) (5.5 g, 22 mmol) was added as an oxidant to this mixture, which was stirred and sonicated for 0.5 h, then kept overnight for the polymerization of aniline on the surface of Fe3O4 HRs. Finally, Fe3O4-PANI NPs were separated, washed several times with DI water and ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C.
2.4. Synthesis of Gr-Fe3O4-PANI nanocomposite for battery applications
Gr-Fe3O4-PANI NC was facilely formed by mixing Fe3O4-PANI HRs and Gr nanosheets (NSs). Briefly, Gr NSs (2 g) and Fe3O4-PANI HRs (10 g) were added in 50 mL 10% ethanol solution and stirred mechanically along with sonication for 0.5 h. Final Gr-Fe3O4-PANI NC was separated, washed several times with deionized water–ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C.28
2.5. Electrochemical measurements of Gr-Fe3O4-PANI NC
Nanocomposites of Gr-Fe3O4-PANI were annealed for 10 min in an inert argon atmosphere at 600 °C. A slurry was prepared by using 90% w/w Gr-Fe3O4-PANI and 10% w/w waterborne polyurethane as a binder. A working anode was prepared from the homogenized slurry, which was spread on Cu foil with a coating density of 30 mg cm−2 and then dried. A coin-type half-cell was constructed for electrochemical tests of anode material.29 A mixture of one molar lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) in ethylene carbonate-diethyl carbonate (in equal ratio) was used as an electrolyte, and a Celgard 2320 tri-layer PP–PE–PP membrane was used as an insulator. The cells were assembled in an inert Ar-filled glove box, and galvanostatic charge–discharge test of the anode in the range of 0.01–3 V against Li+/Li was carried out at different current densities.
2.6. Characterizations
The X-ray diffractogram was obtained on the XRD instrument MSAL-XD2 using Cu Kα radiation. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained by using Bruker VERTEX 70 instrument, and morphological analysis was conducted using scanning electron microscope (SEM) Hitachi S-4800, transmission electron microscope (TEM) Philips EM 400, and HRTEM (JEOL-2010 operated at 200 kV). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TA/SDT Q6 system. BET isotherms were obtained on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus (USA). Cyclic voltammetry was performed at room temperature by using the IME6X electrochemical workstation at 0.01–3 V and a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Chroma 1701 battery test system was used to carry out the galvanostatic charge–discharge tests.
3. Results and discussion
This research work was carried out to prepare a superior anode; thus, LIB anode was made using the Gr-Fe3O4-PANI nanocomposites. This material was subjected to XRD, TGA, BET, SEM, TEM, galvanostatic charge–discharge tests and cyclic voltammetry analysis.
3.1. XRD analysis
The crystalline structure of all the materials was investigated by powder XRD of Gr, PANI, Fe3O4, and Gr-Fe3O4-PANI NC, as shown in Fig. 1(a–d). The pure Gr shows a broad diffraction band at a 2θ value of 25°, which is related to a 0.35 nm interlayer spacing [Fig. 1(a)]. The PANI shows many broad diffraction peaks [Fig. 1(b)]; the most prominent one is at 2θ = 25.4° (d = 0.35 nm). Fig. 1(c) shows the XRD spectra of the Fe3O4 HRs, which is according to JCPDS standard 19-0629, with a = 8.211 Å and dhkl = 2.4993 Å.30 The broad peaks confirm the nanocrystalline nature of Fe3O4 with no impurity. A small broadband at 2θ = 25.1° in the XRD of the Gr-Fe3O4-PANI nanocomposite apparently shows the overlapping of the Gr and PANI reflection peaks, thus showing the existence of PANI and Gr on the surface of the Fe3O4 [Fig. 1(d)].

3.2. Morphological study
SEM analysis of Gr-Fe3O4-PANI demonstrates the ultrathin morphology of graphene, as shown in Fig. 2(c). Interestingly, it indicates that graphene is in the form of nearly transparent, uniform and flexible two-dimensional ultrathin nanosheets with edges rolled up.31 The PANI nanofibers (NFs) synthesized in the absence of graphene and Fe3O4, shown in Fig. 2(d), are similar to those already reported.32,33 As-synthesized Fe3O4 comprises highly uniform hollow rods (HR) with high surface area, as demonstrated in Fig. 2(a and b). The Gr-Fe3O4-PANI nanocomposite demonstrates dissimilar morphology from that of their components PANI, Fe3O4 and Gr, as shown in Fig. 2(e and f). The nanocomposite has a different 2D structure in which Gr is present in wrinkled form with the PANI nanofibers on the surface of Fe3O4 HRs. It is notable that the nanocomposite has uniform morphology with no individual agglomerates of their components Gr and PANI, indicating that Fe3O4-PANI is covered by the Gr sheet. TEM images in Fig. 2(f) and Fig. S1† confirm that PANI nanofibers are anchored on the surface of Fe3O4 HRs to form a PANI-Fe3O4 connection. Consequently, the Fe3O4 HRs act as a template as well as the initiator for the formation of the Gr-Fe3O4-PANI NCs.

3.3. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (BET)
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of Fe3O4-PANI HRs and Gr-Fe3O4-PANI NC are shown in Fig. 3(a). The isotherms are typically type iv isotherm, which corresponds to the mesoporous structures, as defined by the IUPAC classification of nano-porous substances.34 The surface area of Gr-Fe3O4-PANI is 53.3 m2 g−1, which is quite higher than the 10.5 m2 g−1 of Fe3O4-PANI, which is due to the 2D structure of Gr, which can support active sites on the surface.35 Due to the lesser diffusion length of Li+, the higher surface area of Gr-Fe3O4-PANI is quite significant for attaining higher storage of lithium under the quick charging–discharging. The mesoporous structure of Gr-Fe3O4-PANI successfully improves the electrochemical properties of LIBs by mitigating the changes in volume during the process of lithiation and delithiation.

3.4. Thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis
The thermal stability of Gr-Fe3O4-PANI with respect to the change in temperature was observed by TGA analysis to evaluate the thermal stability of the LIB anode. TGA curves of Gr-Fe3O4-PANI NCs and its components Gr, Fe3O4, and PANI are shown in Fig. 3(b). With the increase in temperature, Gr-Fe3O4-PANI NCs demonstrated four-step degradation in the TGA curve, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Gr and PANI are thermally stable up to 600 °C and 400 °C, respectively, and therefore Gr-Fe3O4-PANI shows a similar weight loss.36 In the first step, 2% weight loss at 100 °C was observed due to the removal of moisture, and 4% weight loss occurred due to degradation of Fe3O4 in the second step at 100–300 °C. In the third step, 6% weight loss occurred due to degradation of PANI at 300–450 °C, and in the fourth step, 9% weight loss above 450 °C was observed due to the degradation of Gr-PANI.37 Overall, 21% mass loss was observed, which validates that the anode material is highly stable even at very high temperature, which was a major drawback of LIBs.
3.5. Electrochemical characterization

3.5.1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis. 
CV was used to determine the redox voltage, which changes with the change in the surface charge. For the 1st cycle, peaks due to the anodic and cathodic current of 2.2 and 0.73 V, respectively, correspond to the oxidation of Fe and reduction of Fe3+. A reduction peak due to the reduction of Fe3O4 by Li+ and the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) was observed. A sharp cathodic peak established the phase transformation of Gr-Fe3O4-PANI and constitution of SEI. Cathodic and anodic peaks are reproduced in the 2nd and 3rd cycle, with the changed position of anodic peaks. Thus, the electrochemical reversibility was indicated after the formation of SEI in the 1st cycle. Fig. 4(a) shows the CV of the anode for the first, second and third cycles. After the electrochemical test, morphology was perfectly retained and no broken or collapsed structures were observed, suggesting structural stability of Gr-Fe3O4-PANI as shown in Fig. S2.†

3.5.2. Galvanostatic charge–discharge test. 
The anode performance was evaluated by the galvanostatic charge–discharge test. In the 1st cycle, current discharge capacity and current charge capacity were found to be 1350 mA h g−1 and 1136 mA h g−1, respectively. Formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) resulted in a low coulombic efficiency of 84.15%. The first discharge curve demonstrates a plateau in the range of 0.7–1 V, which indicates the formation of SEI because of the decomposition of LiPF6 electrolyte and insertion of Li+ into the Gr-Fe3O4-PANI NC. However, in the first charge curve, no plateau was seen, verifying SEI formation as an irreversible process. Afterward, charge–discharge curves for 2–250 cycles remained similar, thus endorsing the reversibility and stability of Li insertion and deinsertion. The current charge and discharge capacity of 1060 mA h g−1 and 1086 mA h g−1 were observed along with a coulombic efficiency of 97.6% in the second cycle [Fig. 4(b)]. In the beginning, a decrease in current discharge capacities from 1350 to 960 mA h g−1 was observed from the 1st to 10th cycle, and after that, no change in this value was observed up to 250 cycles, showing more than 99.37% coulombic efficiency (Table 2). Only a minute drop in the charge–discharge capacity was seen during the first 10 cycles owing to the rearrangement of PANI with the Gr and Fe3O4, which activated all the electrode material during the first few cycles. The results illustrate the decent cyclic stability of Gr-Fe3O4-PANI and consistency from 10–250 cycles, supporting its stability and activation. Rate performance against the cycle number was evaluated for the Gr-Fe3O4-PANI anode at a variable current density of 0.1–5 A g−1 [Fig. 4(d)]. Even at a high value of 5 A g−1, the higher reversible capacity of 98 mA h g−1 was observed, and when the current density was decreased to 0.1 A g−1, reversible capacity reached its high value again. Cyclic efficiency test of Gr-Fe3O4-PANI shows a very high performance with a reversible specific capacity of 949 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles. A very high coulombic efficiency (>99%) after the 10th cycle is shown in Fig. 4(c). Reversible capacity of the Gr-Fe3O4-PANI is considerably better as compared to the already reported anode materials (Table 2).

The distinctive structure of Gr-Fe3O4-PANI includes a very low thickness, higher surface area, and vacancies, which enable the facile insertion and desertion of Li+ into the Gr-Fe3O4 structure (Fig. 2b). The synergistic effects of these structural features not only facilitate the transportation of electrons and ions but also stimulate the penetration of the electrolyte. The Gr-Fe3O4-PANI exhibits a long-term cycling stability, superior rate capability, and high reversible capacity, which make it a potential material as an efficient electrode. Gr and PANI have the best electron conductivity and are p-type materials,46 smoothly enabling Li+ transfer. Owing to the high conductivity of PANI and enhanced cell kinetics, coulombic efficiency after the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 10th, 20th, 50th, and the 250th cycle was 84.15%, 97.60%, 98.01%, 98.70%, 99.78%, 99.64%, and 99.37%, respectively (Table 3). The coulombic efficiency after the 20th cycle became almost constant and retained more than 99% of its value up to 250 cycles.

4. Conclusions
The nanocomposite Gr-Fe3O4-PANI was prepared for use as a high-performance anode in LIBs. PANI nanofibres were anchored selectively at the surface of Fe3O4 HRs by polymerizing aniline in the presence of Fe3O4 HRs and GR. TEM analysis verified the formation of PANI–Fe3O4 junction. The anode presented a large surface area (57.8 m2 g−1), high thermal stability (up to 600 °C), high current density (0.1–5 A g−1), excellent cyclability (250 cycles), superior reversible current capacity (1214 mA h g−1 at 250 cycles), and high coulombic efficiency (99.25%). Galvanostatic charge–discharge test of this anode was performed at the voltage range of 0.01–3 V against Li+/Li at different current densities. Phase transformation of Gr-Fe3O4-PANI and SEI formation were established by the cathodic peaks at 1.15 V and 0.73 V, which correspond to the reduction of ferric and ferrous ions into iron, respectively. Gr-Fe3O4-PANI kept a two-dimensional morphology with no breakage or distortion after battery tests. Therefore, it can be concluded that the production of Gr-Fe3O4-PANI based-material for LIB electrodes is a huge step towards developing energy storage devices that fulfill today's needs.
