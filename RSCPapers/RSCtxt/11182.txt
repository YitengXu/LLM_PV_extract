    , Accepted 16th May 2022First published on 16th May 2022AbstractWater electrolysis is the major prerequisite to realizing future global carbon neutrality, and large-scale production of efficient and economic electrocatalysts is essential for industrial hydrogen production. Herein, MoNi4 catalysts were synthesized by a two-step approach of ball milling and laser-direct-writing, where Ni–Mo powders were directly converted into a MoNi4 alloyed compound and strongly anchored on a nickel foam matrix. The MoNi4/Ni catalyst achieved an overpotential of 43 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH, along with impressive stability at a large current density of 400 mA cm−2 for 100 h. The overpotential of MoNi4/Ni also showed 198 mV lower than that of a commercial Ni mesh electrode when evaluated under real industrial conditions (6 M KOH at 70 °C), allowing its feasibility for practical utilization. Commercial silicon solar cell-driven water electrolysis based on MoNi4 catalysts was also demonstrated, suggesting a promising alternative for replacing noble catalysts for sustainable energy generation.
Introduction
Water electrolysis is considered to be an efficient strategy for the conversion of electrical energy into chemical energy in highly renewable power systems.1,2 Generally, water splitting can be performed under either acidic or alkaline conditions. In an acidic environment, the two half-reactions of water splitting – the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) – have traditionally relied on precious metals and metal oxides, resulting in high cost of hydrogen production.3–5 Water splitting under alkaline conditions broadens the range of electrocatalysts to earth-abundant materials (e.g., Ni-based catalysts), and has been explored in the commercial field for sustainable hydrogen production.6–13 However, there are still challenges in the fabrication of effective HER and OER electrocatalysts with both high intrinsic activity and long-term stability. In the 1980s, Brown and coworkers reported that Ni–Mo alloys exhibited attractive activities as alkaline HER electrocatalysts.14,15 Recent research suggested that alloying Ni with Mo (MoNi4 alloys) could effectively modulate the d-band electron density states of Ni and tune its interaction with reaction intermediates, thus facilitating hydrogen adsorption/desorption.16–18 Soon after, some strategies for synthesizing MoNi4 alloy electrocatalysts were explored to speed up the sluggish HER kinetics under alkaline conditions. As expected, the as-formed MoNi4 electrocatalyst exhibited HER activity comparable to that of the Pt/C catalyst, suggesting its promising potential for practical application.19–24 Generally, the traditional synthesis procedures of MoNi4 electrocatalysts involve a two-step hydrothermal reaction and calcination (H2/Ar atmosphere) approach.18–20,25–27 Such a process is usually performed in the limited inner volume of a Teflon autoclave under rigorous calcination conditions, which greatly restricts the large-scale fabrication of electrodes for industrial applications. In addition, the synthesis of pure MoNi4 phases remains a challenge since the as-formed products are usually accompanied by the generation of many by-products (e.g., MoO3 or NiMoO4).23,24,26 Moreover, durable HER electrodes under high current operation should be carefully considered. The commercial electrodes for water-alkali splitting usually need to perform at high current densities ranging from 200 to 400 mA cm2, and strong adhesion between the catalyst coating and metal substrate is required under the influence of violent current and airflow.28–31 Therefore, it is highly desirable to explore a facile way to achieve scalable production of pure MoNi4 electrodes, and attain a strong bond of catalyst coating on the substrate to ensure high stability.
Laser-assisted methods have been widely used in material processing due to their advantages of large-scale fabrication at room temperature, rapid reaction speed with high yield and high purity, a wide range of source material selection without size limitation, etc.32–34 Some previous results indicated that laser-assisted techniques could achieve the desired alloys without tedious chemical synthesis requirements (e.g., high vacuum, toxic reactants, and high pressure). Furthermore, strong metallic bonds to the substrate can be realized by adjusting the processing conditions, revealing a good way of obtaining unique objective microstructures and phases.35–37 With the aim of achieving highly scalable, high-yield, and high-purity MoNi4 catalysts with low fabrication cost, a fast-processing-speed strategy, named “laser-direct-writing”, was first invented to accomplish this goal. Based on the local photo-thermochemical reaction, an irradiation laser beam was focused on a Ni and Mo metallic powder mixture coating supported by a nickel foam substrate to enable a site-specific phase transition of the Ni and Mo powder mixture directly forming MoNi4 alloys, and at the same time, metallurgical adhesion between the MoNi4 coating and nickel foam substrate can also be achieved. Our results reveal that the in situ synthesis of the MoNi4 active coating, as well as its strong surface adhesion on Ni foam, can yield a low overpotential of only 245 mV, which in turn stably delivers industrial cathodic current densities of up to 400 mA cm2, superior to that of the state-of-the-art Pt catalyst. It should be noted that our synthesized MoNi4/Ni electrocatalyst can show a long-term stable operation (>100 h) at 400 mA cm2. In addition to the unique features of large-scale production with high yield, this “laser-direct-writing” technology provides an efficient avenue for the design and exploration of highly efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts with desirable compositions, microstructures, and phases.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and structural characterization of the MoNi4/Ni electrocatalyst
The MoNi4/Ni electrocatalyst was prepared by a two-step approach – ball milling and laser-direct-writing, and the fabrication process is illustrated in Fig. 1. In detail, Mo and Ni powders were first ball-milled at a molar ratio of 38:62 for various ball milling times (1, 5, 10, and 20 h). The as-obtained NiMo alloyed powder was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. S1†) to optimize the best milling time. As the milling time increases, the peak intensities of Ni and Mo gradually decrease, accompanied by broadened peak widths. It can be mainly attributed to the grain refinement and accumulation of microstrain as the ball milling proceeds.38 It also indicates that Ni peaks are shifted to a low-angle direction (Fig. S1†), suggesting the diffusion of Mo atoms into the Ni lattice matrix.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the formation of the MoNi4 coating on Ni foam. 
When the ball milling time reaches 20 h, the Ni peak gradually disappears, and the Mo peaks become much broader (Fig. S1†), indicating the formation of an amorphous-like halo peak. It also suggests that a sufficient ball milling time (20 h) may prompt Mo atoms to enter the Ni lattice, which can distort the Ni lattice matrix. This further speeds up the amorphization of the Ni matrix, and thus the typical Ni peaks cannot be detected in the XRD pattern.39,40 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the powdered samples after 1, 5, 10, and 20 h milling are shown in Fig. S2.† The Ni and Mo powder mixture milled for 1 h exhibits a plate-like morphology. When the milling time is switched to 5 h, the morphology substantially changes from a plate-like to a powder-like structure with a small size distribution. In comparison, with a further increase of milling time up to 10 h, particle agglomeration with a random shape is observed. After a continuous increase of milling time to 20 h, a block-like agglomeration structure with a large size can be found, as shown in Fig. S2.† Second, the ball milled powders were evenly spread on nickel foam to form a homogeneous layer. A laser beam was then applied to scan the surfaces of the as-prepared layer to form MoNi4 nanostructures. A thermal imaging system (InfraTec VarioCAM HD) was used to record the temperature variation in the thermal field of the material during the entire laser process. The temperature history of different zones (upper, middle, and lower) of the electrode surface was extracted by using IRBIS 3 professional software (Fig. 2a–c). The corresponding real-time curves of the temperature variation of the selected point in nodal temperature data (arrows in the images indicate the micro-area with the highest temperature) were also recorded during laser processing. From the time dependence-of-temperature plots (Fig. 2d–f), the highest temperature for each point was calculated to be 1323 °C, 1566 °C, and 1842 °C for different zones. It is observed that the temperature increases gradually with the laser scanning process (from the upper to the lower zone), resulting from the heat accumulation under continuous laser treatments. According to the phase diagram of the Ni–Mo alloy (Fig. S3†),41,42 the eutectic point (composition at 35.8 at% Mo) is around 1310 °C. All peak temperatures for the laser treatment process detected in our work are above the eutectic temperature, assuring the melting of the Mo and Ni powders. Since the molybdenum composition in the present work is 38 at% (close to the eutectic composition), the as-obtained alloy should be MoNi3 rather than the MoNi4 crystalline phase after the cooling process. However, the achieved alloy with 38 at% Mo (20 at% Mo cannot generate MoNi4 after laser treatment, see the XRD result in Fig. S4†) in our work is related to MoNi4, which seems to deviate from the results of the phase diagram of the Ni–Mo system. This is probably due to the fast fabrication process of laser treatment with instant heating and cooling steps. Specifically, the ball-milled Ni and Mo atoms with low crystallinity aggregate into a more stable crystal nucleus under the laser treatment with high instantaneous temperature. Subsequently, such crystal nuclei grow into grains of MoNi4 intermetallic compounds via the following equation to minimize the surface energy.4Ni + Mo → MoNi4

XRD was carried out to analyze the variation of phase composition with respect to the milling time after laser treatments (Fig. 3a). The sharp peaks at 43.8°, 51.2°, 74.1°, and 90.0° could be indexed to the MoNi4 planes (ICDD 03-065-5480), which is an indication of high crystallinity in these coatings. Furthermore, a small diffraction peak at 40.5° ascribed to metallic Mo can be observed in 1 h-MoNi4/Ni, 10 h-MoNi4/Ni, and 20 h-MoNi4/Ni, which probably originated from the unreacted Mo powder in the as-milled mixture. The existence of large-sized prepared powder mixtures milled for 1, 10 and 20 h is due to the bad reaction between Ni and Mo, leading to some extra Mo metal being left on the as-formed coatings. Meanwhile, the XRD pattern of 20 h-MoNi4/Ni also indicates the presence of NiMoO4 (ICDD 00-016-0291). An almost amorphous structure was observed in the 20 h-MoNi4/Ni sample, which reacts with oxygen in the air to form NiMoO4. In addition, the XRD results of physically mixed Ni and Mo powders without ball milling after laser treatment (Fig. S5†) can also be well indexed to NiMoO4, indicating that ball milling is an indispensable step to achieve single-phase MoNi4 catalysts. However, extra milling time (more than 20 h) will be unfavorable to form pure MoNi4 species due to the formation of the by-product NiMoO4. The SEM images of 5 h-MoNi4/Ni after laser treatment show a continuous dense surface (Fig. 3b), and 3D porous networks constructed by many ultrathin and smooth nanosheets can be observed in the magnified inset image. However, the surface morphologies of 1 h-MoNi4/Ni and 10 h-MoNi4/Ni coatings were much rougher than that of 5 h-MoNi4/Ni, with plenty of shrunken pores and non-fusion balls (Fig. S6†). The mismatch of thermal coefficients for Ni–Mo mixture powders may result in pores and balls during the rapid cooling of laser processing. Compared with other samples, the surface of the 20 h-MoNi4/Ni sample is even more irregular, and composed of large line cracks bonded to each other coherently (Fig. S7†). This could be ascribed to the large residue stress and surface tension in the highly unstable melting pools formed during laser scanning. Nanosheets of the 5 h-MoNi4/Ni sample were further elucidated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 3c). High-resolution TEM of MoNi4 nanosheets shows interplanar spacings of 0.207 nm and 0.178 nm, corresponding to the (121) and (002) lattice planes of MoNi4 (the inset image of Fig. 3c).18,43 The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3d) also confirms the existence of MoNi4, in which each diffraction ring is well indexed to the typical planes of MoNi4. Elemental mapping under energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) indicates a homogeneous distribution of Ni, Mo, and O elements with a Mo/Ni ratio of 0.28, which is close to the stoichiometric ratio of MoNi4 (Fig. 3e and S8†). Meanwhile, the ICP-OES results of the 5 h-MoNi4 sample (Table S1†) showed that the atomic ratio of Mo/Ni in the MoNi4 catalyst is about 0.25, which further verified the existence of MoNi4.

The chemical compositions and surface valence states of 5 h-MoNi4/Ni alloy nanoparticles were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). An XPS survey scan (Fig. S9†) further confirms the presence of Mo, Ni, and O. The molar ratio of Mo/Ni is estimated to be around 0.35, a little different from the EDS data (0.28). With a fixed ion beam energy of 4 eV, different sputter times (30, 60, and 105 s) are applied to refer to different layer depths (1.1, 2.2, and 3.9 μm) for comparing valence variations of the as-prepared 5 h-MoNi4/Ni sample before and after operation in KOH solution (Fig. S10†). We used XPS with Ar+ etching to observe the valence states of each element at different depths of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 4a, the Mo 3d XPS spectra of 5 h-MoNi4/Ni (etching for 30, 60, and 105 s) have a large envelope of peaks that can be deconvoluted into four sets of doublets from Mo0, Mo4+, Mo5+ and Mo6+ with the 3d5/2 peaks centered at 227.9 eV, 229.1 eV, 230.5 eV and 232.2 eV, respectively.20,43 The high-resolution Ni 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 4b) was de-convoluted into three pairs of peaks, which were ascribed to Ni2+ species at 873.1 eV and Ni0 species at 869.6 eV accompanied by two broad satellite peaks. However, the Mo0, Mo4+, Mo5+, and Ni0 peaks were not observed at the topmost surface of the catalyst due to oxidation in air. As the sputtering went on (30 s), additional components appeared at the lower binding energy side of the Mo 3d and Ni 2p peaks, which should be attributed to Mo0, Mo4+, Mo5+, and Ni0 species (see Fig. 4a and b).

In order to explore the oxidation state changes of Mo and Ni after the durability measurement, we extracted the Mo 3d and Ni 2p signals of 5 h-MoNi4/Ni after operation in KOH for 1 h (Fig. 4c and d). It is observed in Fig. 4d that the additional Ni0 component increased when etched for 30 s, similar to the situation in 5 h-MoNi4/Ni before operation. Meanwhile, it was noted that the Ni 2p orbitals (etching for 0 and 30 s) after the HER test were shifted to high binding energy, indicating the thickening of the oxide layer after the operation (Fig. 4d). In addition, the mass percentages of all Mo species (Mo0, Mo4+, Mo5+, and Mo6+) before and after operation are summarized in a histogram to compare the vitiation of Mo species (Fig. 4e, f and S11†). It was found that the content of Mo6+ species in 5 h-MoNi4/Ni decreased, but the Mo5+ content increased after operation in KOH with the extension of the etching time (from 30 s to 105 s). This can be attributed to the transformation from Mo6+ to Mo5+ on the surface of the catalyst layer under negative potential operation in KOH. Therefore, those Ni2+ and Mo5+ species on the topmost surface in the catalysts can function as the main active sites because the catalytic reactions tend to occur primarily on the near-surface of the catalysts.
HER performance of catalysts
To evaluate the electrocatalytic HER activities, the laser-treated samples are directly used as working electrodes for electrochemical measurements in a classic three-electrode system. We compared the HER performances of the laser-prepared MoNi4 coatings with different ball milling times and commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. The polarization curves of these samples in 1 M KOH solution are shown in Fig. 5a. The catalytic performance increases and then decreases with an increase of the ball-milling time, and the optimized ball milling time is 5 h with the best HER activity (Fig. 5b). According to the polarization curves, the 5 h-MoNi4/Ni sample exhibits an overpotential of 43 mV to achieve a geometric current density of 10 mA cm−2 (η10). The η10 of the 5 h-MoNi4/Ni sample is close to that of the Pt/C catalyst and even exceeds that of Pt/C at high current density. Meanwhile, the HER performances of pure nickel foam and NiMo mixed powders without ball milling were also measured for comparison, and both showed low HER activity (Fig. S12†). This further illustrates the significance of the ball milling prior to laser treatment. To eliminate the effect of catalyst loading on the HER activity, the current density of LSV data was normalized with the catalyst loading mass on nickel foam (the coating amount of the active component was calculated via the mass difference between the bare Ni foam and the coated Ni foam after laser treatment, see Table S2†). As displayed in Fig. S13,† the HER activity of the 5 h-MoNi4/Ni coating is almost comparable to that of Pt/C after mass normalization. Meanwhile, the MoNi4/Ni catalysts present a price of only 118.6 US$ m−2 including the cost of the Ni foam support, which is almost 34 times lower than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts (Table S3†). Taking the performance and cost factors into consideration, the 5 h-MoNi4/Ni coating is regarded as a competitive substitute for Pt/C catalysts. The Tafel slope was measured to characterize the HER kinetics. By fitting the linear part of the Tafel plot, the 5 h-MoNi4/Ni catalyst possesses a Tafel slope of 44 mV dec−1, lower than the 56, 54, and 88 mV dec−1 of 1 h-MoNi4/Ni, 10 h-MoNi4/Ni and 20 h-MoNi4/Ni coatings, respectively (Fig. 5c). The Tafel slope of MoNi4/Ni lies in the range of 39–118 mV dec−1, suggesting a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism with the Heyrovsky desorption as a rate-determining step.44,45 In addition, the electrode reaction kinetics is further evidenced by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. The 5 h-MoNi4/Ni catalyst has the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct = 1.455 Ω cm−2) compared with other samples, as shown in Fig. 5d and Table S4.† The smaller Rct implies faster electron transport during the HER, thus offering a higher HER activity.

(h) A comparison of the fabrication time and overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH of transition metal Ni–Mo based HER catalysts obtained by different methods. 
To get insight into the origin of the high electrocatalytic activity of the 5 h-MoNi4/Ni coating, the electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) of the electrodes were estimated by the cyclic voltammetry technique to obtain the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) (Fig. 5e and S14†). As shown in Fig. 5e, 5 h-MoNi4/Ni has a considerably higher Cdl (83.7 mF cm−2) than the other three samples, suggesting more accessible active sites in the 5 h-MoNi4/Ni coating.
To investigate the effect of surface wettability on HER efficiency, we examined the hydrophilicity of samples with different ball milling times from the perspective of static contact angle (θ) (Fig. 5f). Suitable catalyst wettability facilitates enrichment of the reactants around the catalysts, thus improving the catalytic activity, particularly at high current densities. The static contact angle images show that the 5 h-MoNi4/Ni sample presents the smallest contact angle (42.5°), which is much lower than those of the other three catalysts (in the range of 60°–80°). These results strongly suggest that the hydrophilic 5 h-MoNi4/Ni sample with hydroxyls could effectively adsorb the H2O reactant, forming a high concentration of H2O in the MoNi4 nanosheets. It has been proposed that increasing the concentration of one reactant around the active sites with an unchanged concentration of other reactants can promote reaction rates.46 Therefore, the reason for the 5 h-MoNi4/Ni catalyst exhibiting excellent HER performance can be attributed to its high intrinsic activity and good affinity for electrolyte droplets.
Aside from catalytic activity, long-term stability is also an important descriptor for an active HER electrode. The durability of the as-fabricated 5 h-MoNi4/Ni electrode was tested at constant current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm2 for a total time of 100 h. As shown in Fig. 5g, there is no obvious decline after 100 h of chronoamperometry measurements, indicating the excellent stability of the 5 h-MoNi4/Ni catalyst for the HER. The SEM and TEM images of the 5 h-MoNi4/Ni sample display a negligible change of the morphology and structure before and after long-term stability measurement (Fig. S15 and S16†). This is due to the strong metallurgical bond between the MoNi4 coating and nickel foam formed by the laser treatment. The fabrication method of the MoNi4/Ni catalyst has noticeable advantages over other methods such as the hydrothermal reaction, gas–solid reaction, and electrodeposition (Fig. 5h and Table S5†). It is worth indicating that the synthesis time for the MoNi4via the laser-direct-writing method is only 14 s, three to four orders of magnitude lower than those of traditional synthesis methods of Ni–Mo catalysts. Meanwhile, the laser-prepared MoNi4 also shows lower HER overpotential than other NiMo counterparts in alkaline media. Briefly, the laser-direct-writing strategy is time-efficient to synthesize scalable electrodes with high HER performance.
The XPS spectra associated with Ar+ bombardment indicated that the content of Mo5+ species in the 5 h-MoNi4/Ni sample increased after the durability measurement, and thus a plausible mechanism can be proposed to illustrate the HER catalytic process via the classical two-electron-reaction models of Volmer–Tafel or Volmer–Heyrovsky routes, in accordance with our previous work (Fig. 6).47,48 Herein, the Mo6+ species on the catalyst surface is inclined to be reduced to Mo5+ under operation at negative potential. H3O+ cations produced by the water dissociation are weakly bound to the vacant sites on the metal complex (Mo5+–Mo5+) via a dative bond (step 1). In the subsequent path (step 2), the H3O+ cations on the active Mo5+ sites are reduced to H− driven by the applied negative potential, accompanied by the oxidation of Mo5+ to Mo6+. The generated H− are chemically coordinated to the Mo center by forming a covalent bond (Mo6+–H−). In the following reductive elimination step 3 and dissociation step 4, the oxidation state of the Mo center returns to Mo5+, resulting in the formation of a dihydrogen (H2) molecule. Moreover, since fewer protons existed in the alkaline solution, the HER process inevitably underwent water dissolution to produce H3O+ cations. It is reported that Ni(OH)2 is particularly active for dissociating water molecules in alkaline solutions. According to previous reports, Ni foam coated with Ni species can generate Ni(OH)2 after soaking in KOH solution.49 In this paper, Ni2+ species are present on the MoNi4/Ni catalyst surface in the form of Ni(OH)2, which accelerates the dissociation of water by building up the surface of Ni(OH)–M(metal).47,50,51 Therefore, the synergistic effects of Ni2+ (Ni(OH)2) and Mo5+ (MoNi4) on the water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption–desorption steps contribute to the excellent HER activity in alkaline media.

A commercially advanced alkaline water electrolyzer usually requires a catalyst electrode with the typical size of several square meters. To confirm the capability to scale up production, we prepared a MoNi4/Ni catalyst with an area of 100 cm2 by laser treatment within 5 min (Fig. 7a). The catalysts were coated over a whole nickel foam substrate uniformly. Meanwhile, a nickel mesh is widely used as the cathode substrate in alkaline electrolytic cells due to its low cost, simple preparation, and good corrosion resistance. Therefore, we also prepared a MoNi4 catalyst with an area of 100 cm2 on a nickel mesh substrate by laser scanning (Fig. S17†).

(c and d) Polarization curves for the 5 h-MoNi4/Ni sample and Ni mesh in 6 M KOH (c) and 6 M KOH at 70 °C (d). (e) Long-term stability tests of the 5 h-MoNi4/Ni catalyst at a high current density of 400 mA cm−2. 
To evaluate the performance of the MoNi4/Ni catalyst under industrial conditions, LSV measurements were conducted in a real industrial water electrolysis environment. A Ni mesh is usually utilized as a commercial HER electrode in a water-alkali electrolyzer, and thus it was selected as a contrast sample to examine the HER activity of MoNi4/Ni in 6 M KOH solution at 25 °C and 70 °C. It is found that the overpotentials of the MoNi4/Ni catalyst at a current density of 200 mA cm−2 are 315 mV and 346 mV (25 °C and 70 °C), lower than those of the industrial nickel mesh (Fig. 7c and d), indicating the promising application of the MoNi4/Ni catalyst in industry. Moreover, the laser-prepared MoNi4/Ni catalyst showed an almost steady trend with a slight decrease in potential after operating for 100 h at 400 mA cm−2 (Fig. 7e), suggesting the excellent long-time durability in 1 M KOH electrolyte at an ultrahigh current density. Note that we chose a Pt mesh rather than a carbon rod as the counter electrode, since carbon rods would gradually dissolve at such a high current. Therefore, the slight drop in potential (increase in HER performance) can be attributed to Pt deposition in Mo-based catalysts in the cathode, being consistent with our previous work.48
The cost of electricity and specific power consumption are important factors in industrial hydrogen production. The use of low-cost solar cells to drive electrolysis is an appealing option to achieve low-carbon sustainable development. To this end, we assembled the laser-prepared large electrode and a Pt mesh as an alkaline water electrolyzer driven by a commercial Si solar cell (5 V, 1 A) (Fig. 7b). This large-sized MoNi4/Ni electrode can produce continuous hydrogen gas when exposed to sunlight (Movie S1†). Therefore, the catalyst is economically competitive considering its superior catalytic activity and long durability operating at an industrially required current density (400 mA cm−2). The strategy presented here is cost-effective and time-efficient to inspire the exploration of non-precious Ni-based catalysts for practical hydrogen production.
Conclusions
In summary, a two-step approach – ball milling and laser-direct-writing – was first invented to synthesize a MoNi4 nanosheet structure anchored on a Ni-foam framework. Our results reveal that the as-prepared MoNi4/Ni electrocatalyst exhibits an ultrahigh HER activity in an alkaline electrolyte, in terms of an extremely low overpotential of 43 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Moreover, it exhibits stable working at a high current density of 400 mA cm−2 for 100 h. Our experiments show that the synergistic effects of Ni2+ and Mo5+ of the MoNi4 nanosheets on the water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption–desorption steps contribute to the excellent HER activity in alkaline media. Furthermore, the strong metallurgical bond between the MoNi4 coating and nickel foam formed by the laser treatment was verified to demonstrate better durability at a high current density of 400 mA cm−2. Also, this smart strategy can realize scaled-up production of HER catalysts with a very short synthesis time of up to 14 s, and the 5 h-MoNi4/Ni catalyst can achieve a competitive HER performance to the commercial Ni mesh HER electrode in 6 M KOH solution at 25 °C and 70 °C. This work provides a promising strategy for fabricating cost-effective, efficient, and large-scale Ni-based HER electrodes for sustainable hydrogen production.
Experimental section
Material synthesis
First, Ni62Mo38 powder was processed by ball milling. A 150 ml stainless steel jar, with hardened steel balls of Ø = 6 mm, was used for the ball-milling processes. The jar and milling media were charged with 10 g of Ni and Mo powders. The used ball to powder ratio (BPR) was ∼40:1. To avoid excess cold welding of the powders, 1.5 ml of isopropanol alcohol was used as a process control agent (PCA). A rotation speed of 400 rpm was employed, with 20 min milling and 10 min pause to reduce overheating of the powder. In order to obtain powders with different morphologies, the samples were extracted following different periods of milling (1, 5, 10, and 20 h). In the second step, the ball milled powders mixed with ethanolamine were evenly spread on nickel foam (1 × 1 cm2) via knife coating technology. The coated samples were then dried in a drying oven at a heating temperature of 60 °C for 1 h. A nanosecond pulsed laser was used to sinter the NiMo alloy powders and nickel foam. The laser scanning speed was 100 mm s−1, and the power was 49 W.
Laser temperature measurement
A sample of size 1 × 1 cm2 was taken for laser treatment. The laser scanning speed was 100 mm s−1, and the power was 49 W. Throughout the laser processing, the thermal field of the material was recorded using a thermal imaging system (InfraTec VarioCAM HD). The temperature history of the different zones (upper, middle, and lower) of the electrode surface was extracted using IRBIS 3 professional software. The temperature was calibrated in the thermal imaging system.
Materials characterization
SEM as well as the corresponding elemental mapping, and EDX analysis were performed on a Hitachi S-4800 with an electron acceleration energy of 5 kV. TEM images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100F with an electron acceleration energy of 200 kV. XRD patterns were recorded using a DX-2700BH with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) with a step size of 0.2°. XPS experiments were carried out on an Axis Supra instrument from Kratos Analytical Ltd. using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray beam (1486.6 eV).
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical performance analysis was carried out in a three-electrode system at room temperature. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a graphite rod were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The potentials were referenced to an RHE by adding 1.067 V (0.241 + 0.059 × pH) in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The scan rate was 5 mV s−1 for the linear sweep voltammetry tests. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out at an overpotential of 120 mV while the sweeping frequencies ranged from 100000 Hz to 0.1 Hz. CV was conducted between 0.28 and 0.38 V versus an RHE with a scan rate of 4–16 mV s−1. The stability measurements were carried out under a static current density of 10 mA cm−2, 100 mA cm−2, and 400 mA cm−2 for 100 h, respectively. In the high-current stability test at 400 mA cm−2, a Pt mesh was chosen as the counter electrode since carbon rods are prone to dissolution at such a high current. All polarization curves and durability tests have been iR-corrected.
