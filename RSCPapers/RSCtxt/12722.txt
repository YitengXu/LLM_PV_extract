    AbstractThe optical properties of Yb3+ and Er3+ co-doped Ln2BaZnO5 (Ln = Y or Gd), synthesized by solid-state reaction, are investigated in detail. Two main emission bands centered around 548 nm (green) and 673 nm (red) are observed under 977 nm laser excitation via an upconversion process. Studies of the behavior as a function of dopant concentration are described and relatively high infrared to visible upconversion efficiencies of ∼5% are obtained at room temperature. Under modulated 977 nm excitation and for fixed dopant concentrations, the upconverted emission chromaticity can be varied by changing the excitation duration. The results of power dependence studies and lifetime measurements are presented. This detailed study of the upconversion processes allows us to identify the dominant upconversion mechanisms in Yb3+,Er3+ co-doped Ln2BaZnO5 oxides.
1. Introduction
Since its discovery in the 1960s,1–3 upconversion (UC) has been the focus of much research. Potential applications include solar cells,4–7 novel display technologies,8–10 inks for secure printing11 and, more recently, biophysics.12–14 Upconverting materials could indeed be used as probes for single molecule imaging in biological cells. For bioimaging, nanoparticles with high brightness and continuous emission are required. In addition, they need to be resistant to photobleaching and have a minimal spectral overlap with the cellular autofluorescence. Current imaging methods use organic dyes or fluorescent proteins. The use of such probes is problematic because of their sensitivity to photobleaching, which limits the imaging times. Another major drawback is that they are usually excited by UV light, often resulting in tissue photo-toxicity and limited observation depth (due to poor light penetration). Fluorescence imaging using NIR excitation is expected to have a major impact in biomedical imaging. NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals were shown to present ideal properties for single molecule imaging experiments.15 They emit under low energy excitation (980 nm), which makes the imaging process less damaging for the biological tissues. The use of upconverting materials is also being considered in the photovoltaic industry for the development of high-efficiency solar cells. The largest losses in the traditional silicon solar cells arise from the mismatch between the wavelengths in the solar spectrum and those that can be efficiently used by solar cells. Photons below the band gap of the silicon semiconductor (i.e. photons with a wavelength above 1100 nm) are not absorbed and do not contribute to energy conversion, while a portion of energy above the band gap is also lost. Significant improvements in solar cell efficiencies can therefore be expected by combining luminescent upconverting and downconverting layers that would shift the energies of these wasted photons to the spectral range that is optimally used by solar cells. Trupke et al.16 deposited an upconverting layer based on NaYF4:Er3+ phosphors at the rear face of a silicon solar cell and demonstrated that external quantum efficiencies close to 1% could be achieved under laser excitation at 1550 nm in a poorly optimised prototype. Both of the above applications require, however, the development of more efficient, high stability upconverting materials with low excitation density thresholds. Oxide materials are usually very stable chemically, mechanically and thermally, and could therefore be promising hosts for light upconversion applications.
Most of the rare-earth upconversion work is focused on the investigation of halides,17–22 glasses23–26 and oxides.27–30 In the present work, we present results obtained on a new host, namely Y2BaZnO5. Ln2BaZnO5 ternary oxide hosts were first reported by Raveau and Michel in 1982.31,32 Since then they have attracted attention for their interesting magnetic and optical properties. Ln2BaMO5 oxides (Ln = Y, Gd and M = Zn, Cu) crystallize in the orthorhombic system, space group Pnma. Ln ions occupy two different sevenfold coordinated sites with the same symmetry but with slightly different Ln–O distances, while the M ions exhibit an unusual distorted tetrahedral coordination. A great variety of magnetic properties has been observed when changing the nature of Ln and M.33,34 The optical properties of Ln2BaMO5 (Ln = Y, Gd, Er, Yb, Eu and M = Cu, Zn) were also investigated.35,36 High resolution absorption spectroscopy measurements were carried out at low temperatures, revealing the presence of two non-equivalent Ln3+ sites.32 More recently, Birkel et al.36 investigated the upconversion properties of Gd2BaZnO5:Yb3+,Er3+ and La2BaZnO5:Yb3+,Er3+ under 980 nm continuous excitation and observed bright green and red emissions. In the present work, we focus on the investigation of Yb3+–Er3+ co-doped Y2BaZnO5 and Gd2BaZnO5 hosts for infrared to visible upconversion. We show that, by optimizing dopant concentrations, upconversion efficiencies in excess of 5% can be achieved. We also show that these phosphors present interesting colour tunability properties when changing the excitation pump duration. Luminescence mechanisms are elucidated through power dependence and lifetime measurements.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of Ln2BaZnO5:Yb3+,Er3+phosphors
Ln2BaZnO5:Yb3+ (x%),Er3+ (y%) phosphors (with Ln = Y or Gd, and x and y ranging from 0 to 12%) were synthesized by solid-state reactions. Stoichiometric amounts of Ln2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%), Yb2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%), Er2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%), ZnO (Fisher Scientific, 99.5%) and BaCO3 (Fisher Scientific, 99+%) were mixed, ground together, and sintered at 1200 °C for several days with intermediary grinding stages.
2.2. ICP-AES analysis
Dopant concentrations were measured by ICP-AES (Varian Liberty ICP-AES) after digesting the samples in high purity nitric acid (Fisher Scientific, Nitric acid 69% Optima).
2.3. X-Ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis
X-Ray powder diffraction patterns were measured using a theta–theta diffractometer (Bruker D8), equipped with a Cu Kα source (generator: 40 kV and 40 mA), a scintillation detector with pulse-height analysis, and a variable knife-edge collimator for high resolution X-ray diffractometry. The best achievable instrumental resolution is 0.08° in 2θ.
2.4. Upconversion luminescence spectroscopy
For spectroscopic studies, the sample was finely ground and sandwiched between two quartz plates (Helma, 106-QS). For the acquisition of upconverted luminescence spectra, samples were excited with the 977 nm output of a temperature-controlled cw laser diode (Thorlabs, L980P100 and TCLDM9) driven by a laser controller (ILX-Lightwave LDC-3742), and pulsed either using a function generator (Agilent Hewlett-Packard 33120A) or a precision pulsed current source (ILX Lightwave LDP-3811). The visible upconverted emission spectra were recorded with a conventional setup consisting of a monochromator (grating 1200 lines per mm blazed at 500 nm Bentham TMC 300-C) and detected using a Si-photodiode (Newport Si 818-UV) via lock-in detection (Signal recovery, dual phase DSP 7265). Longpass and shortpass filters were used as appropriate (Schott RG 715, Edmund Optics NT47-819). All spectra have been corrected for the optical response of the system and filters used. For excitation power-dependence measurements the power was measured using a calibrated detector and power meter (Newport 835 with a Newport Si 818-UV detector).
For upconversion efficiency measurements, the sample of interest was finely ground and sandwiched between two quartz plates (Helma, 106-QS), one of which was coated with a reflective layer of aluminium. The sample holder was then placed at the rear face of an integrating sphere (Instrument System, ISP-150-100). The 977 nm excitation signal was focused onto the centre of the sample holder using a focusing lens (Newport, KPX049AR.16). After initial alignment of the setup, the efficiency measurements were performed in two steps. For the first measurement, the quartz sample holder at the rear-face of the integrating sphere was left empty (no sample inside), and the laser excitation on the sample was collected using an optical fiber and analysed with a spectrometer (Instrument System, CAS 140B). For the second measurement, the sample under investigation was placed inside the quartz holder, and both the fraction of the excitation light that had not been absorbed by the sample, and the emitted upconversion light, were collected and quantified. From these two measurements, the fraction of the incident power absorbed by the sample was calculated. The upconversion efficiency was calculated as the ratio of the upconverted emission in the range 380–780 nm to the power absorbed in the range 950–1000 nm.
For emission rise time and lifetime measurements, a tunable optical parametric oscillator (OPO) (Continuum Panther OPO) pumped by the third harmonic wavelength at 355 nm of a Q-switched YAG:Nd laser (Surelite I laser) was tuned to 490 nm, 808 nm or 977 nm to excite the sample with a 7 ns pulse at a 10 Hz repetition rate. The fluorescence from the sample was separated from the pumping light using a filter (Schott, GG 455), and was then passed through a spectrometer (Jobin Yvon, Triax 550) and detected using a photomultiplier tube detector (Hamamatsu R550) connected to a 500 MHz digital oscilloscope (LeCroy, 9350A) and a desktop computer.
3. Results
3.1. Crystal structures

Fig. 1 displays the typical powder X-ray diffraction patterns of Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+(7%),Er3+(3%) (a) and Gd2BaZnO5:Yb3+(7%),Er3+(3%) (b). Both crystal structures are orthorhombic, space group Pnma. Relatively pure phases were obtained, as shown by the good quality of the Rietveld refinements. Cell parameters were obtained for both structures: (a) a = 12.3354(2) Å, b = 5.70897(7) Å and c = 7.06887(9) Å (ICDD 87082), and (b) a = 12.4861(4) Å, b = 5.7713(2) Å and c = 7.1720(2) Å (ICDD 88602). Note that the lattice parameters obtained in the doped samples are slightly smaller than those in the pure phases, which is attributed to the smaller sizes of the Yb3+ (0.0925 nm) and Er3+ (0.0945 nm) compared to Y3+ (0.096 nm) and Gd3+ (0.100 nm).

3.2. Upconversion luminescence emission
Following 977 nm excitation (40 µW) at room temperature, Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+,Er3+ powders yield green to orange emission, visible by the naked eye. Typical emission spectra (Fig. 2a) show an intense emission corresponding to the intra 4f–4f 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 electronic transition of the Er3+ ions at around 673 nm (red), and a weaker emission assigned to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition at around 548 nm (green). Under 490 nm excitation, corresponding to the direct excitation of the above lying 4F7/2 level, the red to green emission intensity ratio is closer to 1 (Fig. 2b). In that case, the 4F9/2 level is populated by non-radiative relaxation from the 4S3/2 and 2H11/2 thermalised levels.

3.3. Concentration dependence of UC efficiencies
The upconverted emission intensity and spectral properties depend on dopant concentrations. In Fig. 3, the emission spectra of four selected samples of the Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+(x%),Er3+(10 − x%) (x = 2, 5, 6, and 7) family are presented. The red to green emission intensity ratio is seen to increase with the Yb3+ to Er3+ concentration ratio. The inset of Fig. 3 shows the evolution of the red to green emission intensity ratio for five selected Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+(x%),Er3+(3%) samples (x = 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11), where the Er3+ concentration is fixed to 3% and the Yb3+ concentration varies from 3% to 11%. The red to green intensity ratio is again seen to increase with the Yb3+ concentration. This concentration dependence of spectral emission properties indicates that the green and red level population mechanisms are different; in particular, the 4F9/2 red emitting level is not exclusively populated by non-radiative relaxation processes from the upper-lying 4S3/2 and 2H11/2 green emitting levels. Moreover, the increase of the red to green ratio with the Yb3+ concentration (at fixed concentration of Er3+) suggests the existence of green level depopulation and/or red level population processes at higher Yb3+ concentrations. These results will be explained in a subsequent section.
 Fig. 3  Upconversion luminescence spectra for selected samples of the Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+(x%), Er3+(10 − x%) (x = 2, 5, 6, and 7) family at room temperature under 977 nm excitation. The inset presents the red to green emission intensity ratio for selected Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+(x%),Er3+(3%) (x = 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) samples at room temperature under 977 nm excitation. 
The upconversion efficiencies of a variety of Ln2BaZnO5:Yb3+(x%),Er3+(y%) samples (Ln = Y, Gd; 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10) were measured at room temperature under 977 nm excitation (Fig. 4). Three independent measurements were performed for each sample. For given Yb3+ and Er3+ concentrations, Gd2BaZnO5 and Y2BaZnO5 doped samples presented similar efficiencies. Samples containing between 3–4% of Er3+, and total dopant concentrations (Yb3+ plus Er3+) in the 10–13% range were shown to present the highest efficiencies for infrared to visible upconversion. A maximum upconversion efficiency of 5.2 ± 0.2% was obtained with Gd2BaZnO5:Yb3+(7%),Er3+(3%) at room temperature under 13.2 mW excitation. It is worth noting that very similar upconversion efficiency values and concentration dependence trends were measured on Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+(x%),Er3+(y%) samples.
 Fig. 4  Room temperature upconversion efficiencies as a function of dopant concentration for a variety of Gd2BaZnO5:Yb3+,Er3+ samples. The upconversion efficiency is expressed as the intensity ratio of the upconverted emission in the range 380–780 nm to the power absorbed in the range 950–1000 nm. The colour bar on the right is used to display the UC efficiency values for each dopant composition. Contour lines (lines with the same upconversion efficiency value) and contour labels displaying the UC efficiencies associated to those contour lines are also included. 
3.4. Pump power dependence of the luminescence emission
Pump power dependences of the green 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and red 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 emissions were investigated at room temperature under 977 nm excitation. Both green and red emissions show a quadratic dependence on the excitation power in the low power regime, which confirms that two-photon steps are involved in the upconversion process (data can be found in ESI†).
3.5. Color tunability with excitation pulse duration

Fig. 5 displays the red to green emission intensity ratio under different 977 nm excitation pulse durations, Pd, ranging from 50 to 4500 µs. As can be seen in the inset of Fig. 5, the red and green emission intensities increase continuously by lengthening the pulse duration. However, the intensity of the red band increases faster compared to the green band, resulting in a variation of the emission color (chromaticity) from green to reddish-orange with increasing Pd. The rise times of the 4S3/2 green and 4F9/2 red emitting levels were measured under 5 ns pulsed 977 nm excitation (OPO). The green level was shown to build up faster than the red one (39 µs and 69 µs rise times, respectively). These results confirm that the green and red emitting levels are populated via two different routes.
 Fig. 5  Variation of the red to green intensity ratio with the excitation pulse duration, Pd. In each measurement, the sample was excited with a pulsed signal of constant amplitude, 154 Hz repetition rate, and variable pulse duration Pd. The individual variations of the red and green emissions with Pd are presented in the inset. The results are presented on a log scale. 
Note that the quadratic dependence of both the green and red band intensities with the change of pumping power (data provided in ESI† Fig. S1) guarantees invariance of chromaticity, irrespective of the excitation intensity.
3.6. Lifetime measurements
The temporal evolutions of the Er3+4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (green) and Er3+4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (red), Er3+4I11/2 → 4I15/2, Er3+4I13/2 → 4I15/2 and Yb3+2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transitions in Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+(7%), Er3+(3%) were recorded under pulsed 490 nm (direct excitation of Er3+4F7/2), 808 nm (direct excitation of Er3+4I9/2), 977 nm (direct excitation of Er3+4I11/2 and Yb3+2F5/2), and 890 nm (direct excitation of Yb3+2F5/2) excitations, respectively. It is worth noting that unlike Yb3+, Er3+ does not absorb at 890 nm, which guarantees a selective excitation of Yb3+ under 890 nm excitation. The intrinsic lifetimes of the Er3+4S3/2, 4F9/2, 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 levels under direct excitation of the levels of interest were measured to be 80 µs (±5%), 92 µs (±5%), 314 µs (±5%) and 2.72 ms (±5%), respectively, while the Yb3+2F5/2 level presented a lifetime of 735 µs (±5%). The temporal evolutions of the Er3+4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (green) and Er3+4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (red) transitions were also recorded under pulsed 977 nm excitation (7 ns pulse) and are presented in Fig. 6. At the end of the excitation pulse (t ≈ 0), no luminescence intensity is observed for 4F9/2; instead, the transient exhibits a typical (delayed) rise and a decay part. This is a clear fingerprint of an energy transfer process.
The experimental intensity data were fitted to:37 I(t) = A(1 − e−t/τr) × (e−t/τd)(1)where A is the intensity factor, and τr and τd represent the rise and decay times of the transient, respectively and are related to the transfer rate constants between Yb3+ and Er3+ and to the intrinsic lifetimes of the levels involved.37 The best fit for the 4F9/2 transient corresponds to τr = 60 µs and τd = 190 µs. The 4S3/2 transient, in contrast, has an instantaneous rise during the excitation pulse in addition to a delayed rise after the end of the excitation pulse, showing that both excited state absorption (ESA) and energy-transfer upconversion (ETU) processes are involved in the 4S3/2 green level population. The rise and decay times of 4S3/2 are, respectively, 38 µs and 169 µs.
 Fig. 6  Temporal evolution of the green 4S3/2 and red 4F9/2 level populations under pulsed 977 nm excitation on a log scale. The inset presents the intensity data at the short times on a linear scale. An OPO system was used for excitation, providing 7 ns pulses with a 10 Hz repetition rate. 
It is worth noting that the lifetimes measured under 977 nm excitation are longer than those obtained under direct 490 nm excitation, which confirms the energy transfer and suggests that the de-excitation dynamics are dominated by the transfer steps in the population channels for the green and red levels.38
Lifetime measurements were also performed on a Yb3+-free Y2BaZnO5: Er3+ (10%) sample. Under 977 nm excitation, the lifetimes of the green 4S3/2 and red 4F9/2 levels were measured to be 539 µs and 1.23 ms, respectively. The green and red level lifetimes in Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+(7%),Er3+(3%) are much shorter than those measured in the Yb3+-free sample, which confirms the predominance of ETU over ESA in the Yb3+, Er3+ co-doped samples.
4. Discussion
Before we propose a model for the mechanisms governing upconversion emission in Ln2BaZnO5:Yb3+,Er3+(Ln = Y, Gd), we summarize the key findings presented in the previous section:
(i) The green and red emissions are assigned to the Er3+4S3/2,2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and Er3+4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions, respectively.
(ii) The green and red emissions are 2-photon processes.
(iii) There are two different routes involved in the population of the green 4S3/2 and red 4F9/2 levels (Fig. 3, 5, and 6).
(iv) There is a small contribution of the non-radiative 4S3/2 → 4F9/2 relaxation to the population of the 4F9/2 level (Fig. 2b).
(v) The red to green emission intensity ratio increases with the Yb3+ concentration at fixed Er3+ concentration (Fig. 3).
Observation (iii) suggests that the mechanisms governing the green 4S3/2 and red 4F9/2 level populations involve two different excited intermediary levels of Er3+. Given the energy matching conditions, the second Yb3+ to Er3+ energy transfer involved in the 4S3/2 green level population route necessarily involves the 4I11/2 intermediary level: Yb3+2F5/2 + Er3+4I11/2 → Yb3+2F7/2 + Er3 +4F7/2 (Er3+) (Fig. 7). According to the experimental results, the intermediary level involved in the red channel population is different from 4I11/2. For favorable energy matching, the red level population route therefore involves the 4I13/2 intermediary level via the following Yb3+ to Er3+ energy transfer: Yb3+2F5/2 + Er3+4I13/2 → Yb3+2F7/2 + Er3+4F9/2. Note that the 4I13/2 level is populated by non-radiative relaxation from the upper lying 4I11/2 level (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Simplified energy level diagram of Er3+ and Yb3+ ions and the dominant upconversion mechanisms in Ln2BaZnO5:Yb3+,Er3+ (Ln = Y, Gd). Radiative processes of ground state absorption (GSA), excited state absorption (ESA) and green and red luminescence, as well as non-radiative energy transfer upconversion (ETU), back energy transfer (BET) and multiphonon relaxation processes are represented. 
As seen in the previous section, the intrinsic lifetime of the 4I13/2 level is much longer than that of 4I11/2 (2.72 ms versus 314 µs), which makes the Yb3+2F5/2 + Er3+4I13/2 → Yb3+2F7/2 + Er3+4F9/2 energy transfer more favorable than the Yb3+2F5/2 + Er3+4I11/2 → Yb3+2F7/2 + Er3+4F7/2 energy transfer. This explains the high red to green emission intensity ratios observed in these materials when excited at 977 nm.
The variation in chromaticity observed as the excitation pulse width is increased is related to the temporal nature of the various energy level populations involved in the excitation and emission process. These are dominated by the Er3+4I11/2 energy level which has a lifetime of ∼314 µs and controls the intensity of red emission observed via the competing rate for non-radiative relaxation to the 4I13/2 level, energy transfer to Yb3+2F5/2, radiative emission and further excitation via ETU or ESA to the Er3+4F7/2 level. Under steady-state conditions, corresponding to the population of the 4I11/2 energy level remaining unchanged, no variation in chromaticity should be observed. This is indeed the case for excitation pulsed longer than ∼1 ms (Fig. 5). For very short excitation pulses green emission dominates (inset to Fig. 5) indicating that the ETU and/or ESA rates are larger than non-radiative relation to the 4I13/2 level. Close inspection of the inset reveals that this remains the case until pulse widths of greater than ∼150 µs are used. It is also of note that the increase in the green emission intensity with pulse width is limited to ∼3 times that at short pulse durations, whereas the red emission increases by more than 2 orders of magnitude. Interestingly the emission lifetimes of the red and green fluorescence are similar (92 and 80 µs respectively) hence this difference is not related to a significant variation in their emission rates. A possible explanation of this relates to the fast population of the long-lived 4I13/2 level by multiphonon relaxation from 4I11/2. This is related to the relatively high phonon energy of the host (around 966 cm−1according to our Raman studies). Once the Er3+4I13/2 energy level becomes populated it undergoes ETU with the consequence of populating the Er3+4F9/2 level and further reducing the population of excited Yb3+ ions; this will then impact on the probability of ETU from the 4I11/2 state. To confirm our hypothesis, a full study on the excited state dynamics is required along with temporal modeling which awaits further work.
The dominant mechanisms likely to govern the upconversion emission in Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+(7%),Er3+(3%) are summarized in Fig. 7. Under 977 nm excitation, both Yb3+ and Er3+ absorb the incident radiation, so that the 4I11/2 level of Er3+ can be populated via two different routes. Owing to the high absorption cross-section of Yb3+ under 977 nm excitation and the high Yb3+ to Er3+ transfer probability, the main population route of the Er3+4I11/2 level involves an energy transfer between Yb3+ and Er3+, as follows: Yb3+2F5/2 + Er3+4I15/2 → Yb3+2F7/2 + Er3+4I11/2. The second route, less likely due to the lower absorption cross-section of Er3+, involves a ground-state absorption (GSA) of Er3+ without any Yb3+ assistance: Er3+4I15/2 + hν → Er3+4I11/2. From the 4I11/2 level of Er3+, the 4F7/2 level is populated by a second ET: Yb3+2F5/2 + Er3+4I11/2 → Yb3+2F7/2 + Er3+4F7/2, and in a lower measure, by an excited state absorption (ESA) of Er3+: 4I11/2 (Er3+) + hν → 4F7/2 (Er3+). The populated Er3+4F7/2 level then relaxes rapidly and non-radiatively to the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels due to the small energy gap to these lower-lying levels. The above processes then produce the two 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 green emissions centered at 514 and 548 nm, respectively. The red emitting level is populated mostly by ET from Yb3+ to Er3+:Yb3+2F5/2 + Er3+4I13/2 → Yb3+2F7/2 + Er3 +4F9/2 but also by multiphonon relaxation from 4S3/2 and 2H11/2.
The room-temperature intrinsic lifetimes of the three intermediary levels involved in the upconversion mechanisms are rather long: 314 µs (Er3+4I11/2), 735 µs (Yb3+2F5/2) and 2.72 ms (Er3+4I13/2) respectively, which increases the chances of second Yb3+ to Er3+ energy transfer that is necessary for upconverted light generation. The lifetimes of the green and red emitting levels are close to 170 µs and 190 µs, respectively. These values are comparable with those measured in NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+.39
5. Conclusion and future work
Upconversion properties of Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+,Er3+ and Gd2BaZnO5:Yb3+,Er3+ oxide materials were investigated. We believe that the high upconversion efficiencies obtained at room temperature (>5%) are the highest reported to date for an oxide phosphor. Page et al.40 performed quantitative upconversion efficiency measurements on a variety of Yb3+, Er3+ co-doped hosts, including NaYF4, Y2O2S and Y2O3. The most efficient upconversion material they investigated was a NaYF4:Yb3+(18%),Er3+(2%) powder sample for which they reported an efficiency of 4%. The most efficient oxide was Y2O3:Yb3+(8%),Er3+(6%) with an efficiency of 1%.
In this paper, we also showed that Y2BaZnO5:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphors present interesting color tunability properties when varying the excitation pulse duration. Power dependence studies and lifetime measurements provided an accurate model for the upconversion mechanisms involved in these materials. Concentration, temperature dependence studies and Judd–Ofelt analyses are currently being carried out and will be the subject of a future publication.
