    AbstractA novel type of donor-π-acceptor double cable poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) derivative bearing a fullerene pendant and a phenyl group as the linking bridge between the P3HT donor and C60 acceptor (C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4) with tunable donor/acceptor ratio was synthesized via a facile postpolymerization functionalization. The molecular structure, electronic property and molecular arrangement, as well as the surface morphology of the synthesized C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 were characterized by FTIR, 1H NMR, UV-Vis and fluorescence emission spectroscopies, XRD and AFM. FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopic studies confirm the polymeric structures of C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 with the successful grafting of the C60 moiety with tunable donor/acceptor ratio (wt.% ∼1:1; 1:0.9; 1:0.8; 1:0.6). UV-Vis absorption spectroscopic study confirms the nature of C60-Ph-P3HT as the mono-adduct of C60, and indicates a very weak perturbation of the molecular arrangement of the P3HT backbone upon the grafting of the C60 pendant. The fluorescence intensity of C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 is found to be dramatically quenched compared to that of the P3HT and P3HT/C60 (1:1) blend, and notably, C60-Ph-P3HT-1 approaches 98% quenching. The molecular arrangement of C60-Ph-P3HT is investigated by XRD analysis, suggesting that the grafted C60 moieties in the side chain slightly interferes with the lamellar stacking of the polythiophene main chain of P3HT. The AFM measurements on the surface film morphology of C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 reveal that the rms roughness of C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 is larger than that of P3HT.
1. Introduction
In the past two decades, conjugated polymers such as poly(p-phenylenevinylenes) (PPVs) and polythiophenes (PTHs) have received much attention for their potential application in flexible polymer solar cells (PSCs).1 So far, the most efficient architecture to build PSCs is the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure comprising of an interpenetrating network of a conjugated polymer donor and a soluble fullerene acceptor as the photoactive layer.1–6 Since the first successful utilization of PTHs in PSCs by Sariciftci et al.,3PTHs have been widely incorporated as the conjugated polymer donor due to their excellent electron-donating ability and electrochemical stability, and specifically poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been nowadays demonstrated by Heeger, Krebs, Brabec and others to be the most attractive and extensively utilized donor material for PSCs.1–6 Despite the recent considerable progress for the study of PSCs pointing to their bright prospects for inexpensive solar energy conversion,6 the power conversion efficiency achieved so far remains low, and this has largely hindered their commercialization.1,6 One of the main problems is that the conjugated polymer donor and fullerene acceptor species are usually chemically incompatible, and tend to undergo uncontrolled macrophase separation to form domains larger than the exciton diffusion length, which may hinder the photoinduced charge separation and the charge transportation in the composite film.1,6,7
To control the morphology within the photoactive layer so as to minimize the donor–acceptor macrophase separation, donor-π-acceptor double cable conjugated polymers with donor and acceptor moieties integrated in the same main chain via a π-linking bridge were developed.1a,1b,7–11 Since the first report of a “charm bracelet” PTH with covalently bound C60 by Benincori et al.,9a the synthesis of the fullerene-based donor–acceptor double cable polymers have been largely focused on PTHs, PPVs, and polyacetylenes (PAs).1a,1b,7–11 For instance, Cravino et al. synthesized a bithiophene–fulleropyrrolidine dyad which was used as a monomer for electrochemical polymerization, resulting in a new PHT double-cable polymer with pendant C60, which could generate a charge separated state after photoinduced electron transfer.9b Ramos et al. used a double cable PPV-type polymer with a pendent fullerene as a single component in PSCs, which exhibited, however, a low efficiency.9c Zhang et al. synthesized soluble copolymers by chemical co-polymerization of a C60-derivatized monomer with another thiophenic monomer unit bearing a solubilizing polyether chain. The use of different ratios of the two monomers led to two soluble copolymers containing 7 and 14 mol% of the fullerene-derivatized monomer.9d In these studies, a homogeneous dispersion of the donor/acceptor domains could be realized and the interface between donor and acceptor counterparts could be improved and even maximized so as to gain an intimate and controllable interfacial contact. Another noteworthy advantage of the donor-π-acceptor double cable conjugated polymers is that their electronic and physical properties can be easily tailored over a wide range by adjusting the structures and ratio of the donor and acceptor moieties, as well as the π-linking bridge. However, the power conversion efficiency of the devices utilizing the donor-π-acceptor double cable conjugated polymers as the donor material was even lower than that of the devices fabricated via the conventional BHJ structure, with the maximum PCE being 0.52%.9g This is mainly because the fullerene content in the donor–acceptor polymers is below the percolation threshold for the formation of a donor network, limiting the transportation of electrons. Therefore, it appears quite important and challenging to synthesize the donor–acceptor polymers with tunable donor/acceptor ratio, and consequently adjustable solubility.
In this paper, a novel type of soluble donor-π-acceptor double cable P3HT bearing a C60 pendant with tunable donor/acceptor ratio was synthesized via a facile postpolymerization functionalization of P3HT. A phenyl group as the simplest π-chromophore has been integrated as the linking bridge of the P3HT donor and the C60 acceptor in order to mediate the electron transfer readily. The synthesized donor-π-acceptor double cable P3HT (C60-Ph-P3HT) has been characterized by FTIR, 1H NMR, UV-Vis, and fluorescence emission spectroscopies, so as to determine the polymeric structure and investigate the electronic properties. The molecular arrangement and thin film morphology of the synthesized C60-Ph-P3HT were also studied by XRD and AFM measurements, respectively. The dependence of the electronic property and molecular arrangement of the synthesized C60-Ph-P3HT on the ratio of donor/acceptor was addressed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All solvents employed (HPLC grade) and other reagents were commercially available, and used without further purification. N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS), sarcosine, 4-formylphenylboronic acid and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4) were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was purchased from Fusol Material, Ltd. (regioregular, Mn = 40872, Mw/Mn = 2.08).12
2.2. Measurements
Column chromatography (CC): SiO2 (100–200 and 200–300 mesh). FTIR spectra were recorded on a TENSOR 27 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) by dropping samples onto KBr pellet. UV-Vis spectra were measured on a UV-3600 spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) using a quartz cell of 10 mm layer thickness and 1 nm resolution. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV400 NMR instrument using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal reference. Fluorescence spectra were measured using a Perkin-Elmer LS55 spectrophotometer. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were taken using a Nanoscope III (Digital Instruments, USA) operating in height mode. Molecular arrangement was evaluated using wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) running in a MXPAHF diffractometer (MacScience, Japan). The voltage and current of an X-ray source were set to be 35 kV and 130 mA, respectively. WAXD profiles were obtained with a 2θ scan mode.
2.3. Synthesis
The synthetic route of the donor-π-acceptor double cable P3HT derivatives (C60-Ph-P3HT) is shown in Scheme 1. The detailed synthetic procedures are as follow:

Poly(3-bromo-4-hexylthiophene) (Br-P3HT). 
Four Br-P3HTs with different content of bromine substitution (20, 18, 16 and 12% for Br-P3HT-1,2,3,4 respectively) were prepared using the same procedure, by varying the molar ratio of the reactants of P3HT and NBS (see step i of Scheme 1). In the following, the synthesis of the 20% bromine-substituted P3HT (Br-P3HT-1) was taken as the example and hereafter only 20% substitutions for other P3HT derivatives were described unless specified. NBS (20.89 mg, 0.117 mmol) was added to a flask containing P3HT (0.10 g, 0.602 mmol) in chloroform (10 mL). The solution was stirred at room temperature for 6 h and heated at 50 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was then poured into a saturated NaHCO3 solution (50 mL). The organic layer was washed with water six times and dried over MgSO4. Precipitation into methanol gave a black solid (96.2 mg). 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ (ppm): 6.99 (g1, broad, 0.805H), 2.82 (f1, broad, 1.609H), 2.63 (f2, broad, 0.405H), 1.72 (e, broad, 2H), 1.37 (bcd, broad, 6H), 0.93 (a, broad, 3H). FTIR (KBr): ν = 2954, 2925, 2857, 1721, 1459, 1377, 1182, 1073, 824 cm−1.


Poly(3-(4-formylphenyl)-4-hexylthiophene) (4-FPh-P3HT). 

Br-P3HT-1 (200 mg, 0.22 mmol Br) and 4-formylphenyl boronic acid (49.5 mg, 0.33 mmol) were mixed in THF (12 mL) in a 20 mL Schlenk flask under nitrogen. After Br-P3HT-1 was dissolved completely, 2 M Na2CO3 solution (1.1 mL, 2.2 mmol) and 10% equiv. molar of Pd(PPh3)4 (25.4 mg, 0.222 mmol) were added, and then the flask was sealed with a glass stopper. The mixture was then heated to 80 °C for 48 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with chloroform and washed with water 3–5 times to remove the excess boronic acid. The organic layer was dried with MgSO4 and the polymer was precipitated from methanol. After purification with methanol using a Soxhlet extractor, the polymer was dissolved in chloroform and passed through a silica gel column using chloroform as an eluent to remove the trace catalyst. The as-prepared polymer 4-FPh-P3HT-1 was again precipitated from methanol and dried under vacuum (195 mg). 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ (ppm): 10.0 (j, single, 0.195H), 7.85 (i, double, 0.389H), 7.42 (h, d, 0.379H), 6.97 (g1, broad, 0.805H), 2.79 (f1, broad, 1.597H), 2.35 (f2, broad, 0.393H), 1.67 (e, broad, 2H), 1.33 (bcd, broad, 6H), 0.89 (a, broad, 3H) (letters a to j stands for chemical shift of different hydrogens). FTIR (KBr): ν = 2730 (–CHO), 1600 (–phenyl) cm−1.


Poly(3-(4-N-methylfulleropyrrolidinephenyl)-4-hexylthiophene) (C60-Ph-P3HT). 

4-FPh-P3HT-1 (40 mg, 0.0428 mmol CHO) was mixed with C60 (150 mg, 0.208 mmol) and sarcosine (19.5 g, 0.216 mmol) in 200 mL of toluene and the mixture was heated at 120 °C for 24 h. After cooling, the reaction mixture was filtrated using a Whatman filter paper (150 mm∅). The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure and precipitated into 100 mL methanol and then collected by centrifugation. The crude solid was purified on a silica gel column using CS2 to remove C60 perfectly, and then washed using toluene as the eluent, yielding a black powder (60.2 mg). 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ (ppm): 7.80 (i, broad, 0.389H), 7.41 (h, broad, 0.379H), 6.97 (g1, broad, 0.805H), 4.98 (k1, double, J = 10.4 Hz, 0.193H), 4.93 (j, s, 0.206H), 4.25 (k2, double, J = 10.4 Hz, 0.195H), 3.0 (m, single, 0.554H), 2.81 (f1,broad, 1.704H), 2.35 (f2, broad, 0.394H), 1.69 (e, broad, 2H), 1.34 (bcd, broad, 6H), 0.89 (a, broad, 3H). (letters a to k stands for chemical shift of different hydrogens). FTIR (KBr): ν = 2783 (N–CH3), 527 (–C60) cm−1.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization of polymers
Among the reported syntheses of the fullerene-based donor–acceptor double cable polymers, P3HT has been extensively studied as the most attractive donor material for PSCs,1a,1b,7–11 for which the synthesis of P3HT-based donor–acceptor polymers, however, requires in general tedious procedures involving the synthesis of monomers, because either the functional groups are often intolerant of the rather harsh polymerization conditions or the functional groups might inhibit the polymerization of monomers.9 In light of the recent success of applying the alternative approach of postpolymerization to functionalize such precursor polymers as PAs and PTHs, so as to simplify considerably the synthetic procedures for the derivatized polymers with versatile functional groups,13 in this work we manage to synthesize the novel donor-π-acceptor double cable P3HT derivatives bearing a fullerene pendant by a postpolymerization approach, as illustrated in Scheme 1, simplifying the functionalization of the commercially available P3HT to merely three steps. Note that, so far, tremendous studies on the P3HT-based PSCs with bulk heterojunction structures have widely used a donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:1 (or 1:0.8) for P3HT/fullerene derivatives (mostly [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester, PCBM), whereas the optimized donor/acceptor weight ratio has not been fully determined.1–5 Hence, in the present work, we preferentially synthesized four new donor-π-acceptor double cable P3HT derivatives (C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4) with different contents of C60 substitution of 20, 18, 15 and 12%, which correspond to different weight ratios of ∼1:1, 1:0.9, 1:0.8 and 1:0.6 (donor:acceptor, see Table 1), respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of tuning the donor/acceptor ratio by our approach, with which other contents of C60 substitution could be realized in principle.

Poly(3-bromo-4-hexylthiophene) (Br-P3HT), poly(3-(4-formylpheny1)-4-hexylthiophene) (4-FPh-P3HT) and poly(3-(4-N-methylfulleropyrrolidinephenyl)-4-hexylthiophene) (C60-Ph-P3HT) have been characterized by FTIR and 1H NMR so as to determine their chemical structures. Fig. 1 compares the FTIR spectra of four grafted 4-FPh-P3HT-1,2,3,4 (a) and C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 (b). Obviously, 4-FPh-P3HT-1,2,3,4 all show a new vibrational line at 2730 cm−1 associated with the aldehydic C–H stretching vibration, which is absent in the FTIR spectrum of the pristine P3HT, indicating that the grafted 4-FPh-P3HT has been successfully synthesized by Suzuki coupling reaction of Br-P3HT and 4-formylphenylboronic acid (see step (ii) of Scheme 1).13b Upon the Prato reaction of 4-FPh-P3HT with C60 and sarcosine,14 such a characteristic vibrational line at 2730 cm−1 disappears in C60-Ph-P3HT, suggesting that the –CHO group of 4-FPh-P3HT has been completely transformed. The IR bands at 527 and 568 cm−1 have usually served as diagnostic vibrational bands for the identification of C60 incorporation into macromolecular chains.11 It is clear that these two characteristic vibrational bands appear in the same frequency in the IR spectra of the four grafted C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 (see Fig. 1b). Another characteristic vibrational band at 2783 cm−1 is assigned to the –CH3 within the N-methylpyrrolidine ring, confirming the successful grafting of the C60 moiety of C60-Ph-P3HT.
 Fig. 1  FTIR spectra of 4-FPh-P3HT-1,2,3,4 (a) and C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 (b) in comparison with that of P3HT. The asterisk, filled circle, filled triangle, and arrow denote the vibrational lines at 2730, 1600, 2783, and 527 cm−1, respectively. 
The chemical structures of Br-P3HT, 4-FPh-P3HT and C60-Ph-P3HT were then elucidated by 1H NMR analysis, as shown in Fig. 2 (see also ESI-S1† for the spectra of other substitution ratios). In the following, only the substitution ratio of 20% (Br-P3HT-1, 4-FPh-P3HT-1 and C60-Ph-P3HT-1) was discussed for clarity. As a reference, the pristine P3HT shows a dominant proton signal at 2.80 ppm (H(f1)), corresponding to the α-methylene protons, which are indicative of hexyl chains adjacent to the thienyl units linked head-to-tail (see Fig. 2A).12,15 After P3HT was brominated at the 4-position of the thienyl ring via electrophilic substitution affording Br-P3HT-1 (see step (i) of Scheme 1), a new broad proton signal near 2.64 ppm (H(f2), Fig. 2B) appears and is attributed to the α-methylene protons within the hexyl chains attached to the partially brominated thienyl ring. Apparently, the chemical shift of H(f2) is down-field shifted compared to that of H(f1), indicating the influence of the bromine as an electron-attracting group on the α-methylene protons. According to the integral ratio of H(g1) to H(a), a bromine substitution ratio of 20% of the P3HT backbone in Br-P3HT-1 is calculated (see ESI-Table S1†). For 4-FPh-P3HT-1, which was synthesized via the Suzuki coupling reaction of Br-P3HT with 4-formylphenylboronic acid (see step (ii) of Scheme 1), obviously a new proton signal around 10.0 ppm (Fig. 2C) appears and is assigned to the protons of the aldehyde (–CHO) group, indicating the successful grafting of the formylphenyl group. In the same way used above, the formylphenyl substitution ratio of 4-FPh-P3HT-1 (20%) was calculated either from the integral ratio of the single peak at about 10.0 ppm to the broad peak at about 0.90 ppm (a, which is due to the proton of terminal methyl (–CH3))13b,15 or from the integral ratio of H(g1) to H(a) (see ESI-Table S1†). Comparing the spectra of 4-FPh-P3HT-1 and Br-P3HT-1, which have the same substitution ratio of 20%, one can find that the chemical shift of H(f2) of 4-FPh-P3HT-1 is evidently down-field shifted versus that of Br-P3HT-1, suggesting that the electron-attracting ability of the grafting group sensitively affects the chemical shift of the α-methylene protons.

1H NMR spectra of P3HT (A), Br-P3HT-1 (B), 4-FPh-P3HT-1 (C), and C60-Ph-P3HT-1 (D). All polymers were dissolved in deuterated chloroform, and spectra were recorded at room temperature. The solvent line of CHCl3 is marked with an asterisk. 
The 1H NMR spectra of C60-Ph-P3HT-1 (Fig. 2D) indicate the complete disappearance of the aldehyde proton signal at about 10.0 ppm, confirming the complete transformation of 4-FPh-P3HT-1 to C60-Ph-P3HT-1. It is clear that two distinct signals at 4.98 and 4.25 ppm are found (H(k1) and H(k2)), which are attributed to the two geminal protons of the methylenes in the pyrrolidine ring, and are split, suggesting that these two protons are not equivalent and exhibit a much more dramatic chemical shift difference (Δδ = 0.73 ppm). Besides, the signal at about 3.0 ppm (H(m)) was assigned to the N-methyl protons of the fulleropyrrolidine, which always appear at 2.98 ppm for the fulleropyrrolidine monoadducts.7,14a Likewise, calculating from either the integral ratio of H(m) to H(a) or from the integral ratio of H(k2) to H(a), the ratio of 4-N-methylfulleropyrrolidinephenyl substitution is determined to be 20% for C60-Ph-P3HT-1, corresponding to a donor/acceptor weight ratio of ∼1:1 (see Table 1 and ESI-Table S1†).
3.2. Electronic absorption and geometric configuration of C60-Ph-P3HT

Fig. 3I presents the UV-Vis absorption spectra of Br-P3HT-1, 4-FPh-P3HT-1 and C60-Ph-P3HT-1 in CHCl3, and also included those of P3HT and C60 for comparison (see ESI-S3† for the UV-Vis spectra of other substitution ratios). The absorption maximum (λmax) of Br-P3HT-1 in CHCl3, which is due to the π–π* transition of Br-P3HT, was observed at 427 nm (curve c), which is dramatically blue-shifted compared to that of P3HT (450 nm, curve a), indicating a certain extent of twisting of the polymer backbone.13b,c Upon the substitution of the bromine group in Br-P3HT-1 by 4-formylphenyl groups affording 4-FPh-P3HT-1, interestingly, λmax of 4-FPh-P3HT-1 (438 nm, curve d) experiences an apparent red-shift of ∼11 nm (see curve d of Fig. 3I). It should be noted that, compared to that of P3HT, λmax of 4-FPh-P3HT-1 is still blue-shifted (∼12 nm), which is, however, much smaller than in the case of Br-P3HT-1. These results indicate the different effect of the electron-withdrawing 4-formyl group and the electron-attracting bromine group on the twisting of the interannular bond between the two thienyl rings.
 Fig. 3  (I): UV-Vis absorption spectra of P3HT (a), C60 (b), Br- P3HT-1 (c), 4-FPh-P3HT-1 (d), and C60-Ph-P3HT-1 (e) in toluene; (II): UV-Vis absorption spectra of P3HT blended with C60 using the weight ratio 1:1 and C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 in toluene. 
The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of C60-Ph-P3HT-1 in CHCl3 solution exhibits two broad absorption bands between 310 and 600 nm (curve e, Fig. 3I). The first absorption band with the first λmax around 327 nm is due to the absorption of the fullerene moiety, which is slightly blue-shifted compared to that of C60 (330 nm, curve b). This absorption peak is known to be sensitive to chemical reactions, i.e., its intensity weakens upon chemical modification to the molecular structure of the C60 cage.16 The second broader band with the second λmax at 432 nm is attributed to the mono-adduct of C60 and amino acid via the Prato reaction and exhibits the common feature of [6,6]-closed structure which gives an electronic absorption peak at 432 nm.13 Interestingly, and coincident, the third λmax of the C60-Ph-P3HT at around 448 nm, which is originated from the π–π* transition of the C60-Ph-P3HT polymer backbone, is partially overlapped with the second λmax at 432 nm, but is still detected as a shoulder absorption band (see inset of Fig. 3I). Noteworthily, for C60-Ph-P3HT, the λmax at around 448 nm is found to be slightly blue-shifted compared to that of P3HT, suggesting a very weak perturbation of the molecular arrangement of the P3HT backbone upon the grafting of the C60 pendant. Fig. 3II compares the UV-Vis absorption spectra of C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 in CHCl3 solution, including that of a 1:1 mixture of P3HT/C60, indicating that both bands with λmax at 327 and 432 nm, as well as the shoulder band at 448 nm discussed above, are exactly the same for different donor/acceptor ratios (see Table 1). This result suggests that, unlike the case of Br-P3HT and 4-FPh-P3HT, the electronic properties of C60-Ph-P3HT are much more independent of the donor/acceptor ratio.
Importantly, it was observed that both the λmax and the absorption onset of the C60-Ph-P3HT-1 are overlapped with those of 4-FPh-P3HT-1. This indicates that the presence of the C60 pendant on the side chain does not affect the band structure of the P3HT chain, suggesting no twisting of the polymer backbone at all. Accordingly a possible energy-minimized structure of C60-Ph-P3HT is proposed in Scheme 2, in which the orthogonality of the phenyl ring and thienyl ring due to the steric interaction of the phenyl group with the hexyl and the neighboring sulfur atom forces the phenyl group to be perpendicular to the main-chain plane of P3HT.17 Subsequently, the pyrrolidine ring connected with such a phenyl group as well as C60 preferably locates in the same orientation with the phenyl ring (i.e., being perpendicular to the main-chain plane of P3HT) so as to minimize its steric interaction with the hexyl substituent on the neighboring thienyl ring and sulfur atom. This proposed structure of C60-Ph-P3HT accounts for the red shift of its λmaxversusBr-P3HT, as discussed above, because the orthogonality of the phenyl ring and thienyl ring forces the phenyl group perpendicular to the main-chain plane and the polymer backbone to become planar.13,17 With this proposed structure of C60-Ph-P3HT, a facile electron transfer from the P3HT donor to C60 acceptor upon photoirradiation, which is readily mediated by the phenyl bridge, is expected (see Scheme 2), as discussed further below.

3.3. Fluorescence property of C60-Ph-P3HT
In the donor–acceptor systems based on the functionalized fullerene derivatives, the singlet excited-state properties (i.e., fluorescence properties) are useful for probing the intramolecular charge transfer dynamics between the donor and fullerene derivatives as the acceptor.18 The fluorescence spectra of C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 and P3HT in chlorobenzene obtained using identical spectrophotometric parameters are compared in Fig. 4. The fluorescence spectrum of P3HT shows a strong fluorescence maximum at 578 nm, which is consistent with previous reports.16c,19 Compared to P3HT, the fluorescence of a mixture of P3HT and C60 with a weight ratio 1:1 is slightly quenched but still comparably strong, indicating that a very weak intermolecular photoinduced electron transfer between the P3HT and C60 may occur. However, in the case of C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4, the fluorescence intensity was dramatically quenched compared to that of P3HT and P3HT/C60, and the extent of quenching is obviously dependent on the different substitution ratio, with C60-Ph-P3HT-1 approaching a 98% quenching according to the integral of the fluorescence band (see Fig. 4). These results indicate that a strong intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer resulting from the covalent linkage of C60 moieties to the P3HT backbone via the phenyl bridge takes place within C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 upon photoexcitation, and such an intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer is sensitively dependent on the donor/acceptor ratio (see Scheme 2 and inset of Fig. 4). Evidently, the significantly higher quenching of the fluorescence intensity of C60-Ph-P3HT compared to the mixture of P3HT and C60 (1:1) confirms that the photoinduced electron transfer of C60-Ph-P3HT is much more facile. This result points to the high potential of the application of C60-Ph-P3HT in PSCs.

3.4. Molecular arrangement and surface morphology of C60-Ph-P3HT
The XRD pattern of the annealed films of P3HT on quartz (curve a, Fig. 5) exhibits typical diffraction peaks corresponding to lamellae formation (a axis, 2θ = 5.46°, interlayer d spacing of 16.1 Å).16c,20,21 The XRD patterns of C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 (curves b–e, Fig. 5) show first-order reflections at 2θ = 5.21, 5.19, 5.15 and 5.07°, respectively, which correspond to the interlayer d spacings of 16.9, 17.0, 17.2 and 17.4 Å, respectively. Noteworthily, the interlayer d spacing values of C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 are slightly larger than that of P3HT, indicating that the grafted C60 moieties slightly interfere with the lamellar stacking of the polythiophene main chain.20 This result coincides with that obtained from the UV-Vis spectroscopic study as discussed above. On the other hand, the intensity of the XRD peaks for all C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 is weaker than that for P3HT film, suggesting that the existence of the C60 moiety in the side chain of P3HT may block the molecular arrangement and crystallization of the conjugated chain of P3HT. Interestingly, with the decrease of the C60 content (i.e., increase of the donor/acceptor ratio) from 20% (C60-Ph-P3HT-1, curve e) to 12% (C60-Ph-P3HT-4, curve b), the C60-Ph-P3HT films exhibit the increase not only of the interlayer d spacing but also of the peak intensity of the 2θ (5.21 and 5.07° respectively), confirming that the extent of C60 substitution slightly perturbs the lamellar stacking of the polythiophene main chain via the steric interaction of the C60 substituent with the hexyl side chain, which uniformly spaces the polythiophene main chain (see Scheme 2).21

To investigate the surface morphology of C60-Ph-P3HT, we carried out AFM measurements of C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4, and Fig. 6 illustrates the AFM images in height mode (images c–f) obtained on the films prepared by spin-casting the chlorobenzene solution onto indium tin oxide (ITO), which also includes those of P3HT (image a) and P3HT/PCBM (image b) for comparison (see also ESI-S4† for their 3D morphologies). It is found that the surfaces of the C60-Ph-P3HT films are all very smooth with a root-mean-square (rms) roughness of 1.662, 1.176, 0.730 and 0.560 nm for C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4, respectively. Noteworthily, the rms roughnesses of C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 are much larger than that of P3HT (0.411 nm), and those of C60-Ph-P3HT-3,4 are comparable to that of the P3HT/PCBM mixture (0.577 nm). Besides, the interpenetrating networks of C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 are well developed and donor–acceptor domains are easy and clear to distinguish. As a result, such a small feature size in the C60-Ph-P3HT film is expected to facilitate the exciton separation and, therefore, benefit charge separation efficiency in PSCs.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized a novel type of soluble donor-π-acceptor double cable P3HT derivative (C60-Ph-P3HT) bearing a C60 pendant as the acceptor, a phenyl group as the linking bridge and tunable donor/acceptor ratio (wt.% ∼1:1; 1:0.9; 1:0.8; 1:0.6) via a facile postpolymerization functionalization of P3HT, which simplified significantly the synthesis to merely three steps. Based on the UV-Vis spectroscopic study, the characteristic absorption peak at 432 nm confirms the nature of C60-Ph-P3HT as the mono-adduct of C60, and the λmax at 448 nm, which is originated from the π–π* transition of the C60-Ph-P3HT polymer backbone, is found to be slightly blue-shifted compared to that of P3HT, suggesting a very weak perturbation of the molecular arrangement of the P3HT backbone upon the grafting of the C60 pendant. A possible energy-minimized structure of C60-Ph-P3HT has been proposed with the phenyl group and pyrrolidine ring being perpendicular to the main-chain plane of P3HT. The fluorescence intensities of C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 are found to be dramatically quenched compared to those of P3HT and the P3HT/C60 (1:1) blend, with C60-Ph-P3HT-1 approaching 98% quenching. The molecular arrangement of C60-Ph-P3HT is investigated by XRD analysis, suggesting that the grafted C60 moieties in the side chain of P3HT slightly interferes with the lamellar stacking of the polythiophene main chain. Finally, the surface morphology of the C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 films was measured by AFM, revealing that the rms roughnesses of C60-Ph-P3HT-1,2,3,4 are all larger than that of P3HT. Besides the facile synthesis of the donor-π-acceptor P3HT derivative via the facile postpolymerization approach, C60-Ph-P3HT-1 may become a promising photoactive material in PSCs in terms of its nearly 100% quenching of the fluorescence intensity and increased rms roughness versus the pristine P3HT.

The 1H NMR spectrum of P3HT shows a dominant proton signal at 2.80 ppm (H(f1)) along with a very small neighboring signal at 2.56 ppm which is attributed to a small percentage of the head-to-head linkages. Comparing the integrated area of this small signal with that of H(f1), the degree of regioregularity of P3HT was calculated to be about 93% (see ESI-S1†).
