    , Accepted 3rd January 2013First published on 7th January 2013AbstractIn this paper, we report the design and synthesis of isoindigo based low band gap polymer semiconductors, poly{N,N′-(2-octyldodecyl)-isoindigo-alt-naphthalene} (PISD-NAP) and poly{N,N′-(2-octyldodecyl)-isoindigo-alt-anthracene} (PISD-ANT). A series of donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers can be prepared where donor and acceptor conjugated blocks can be attached alternately using organometallic coupling. In these polymers, an isoindigo dye acceptor moiety has been attached alternately with naphthalene and anthracene donor comonomer blocks by Suzuki coupling. PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT exhibit excellent solution processibility and good film-forming properties. Gel permeation chromatography exhibits a higher molecular mass with lower polydispersity. UV-vis-NIR absorption of these polymers exhibits a wide absorption band ranging from 300 nm to 800 nm, indicating the low band gap nature of the polymers. Optical band gaps calculated from the solid state absorption cutoff value for PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT are around 1.80 eV and 1.75 eV, respectively. Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) values calculated respectively for PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT thin films on glass substrate by photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) are 5.66 eV and 5.53 eV, indicative of the good stability of these materials in organic electronic device applications. These polymers exhibit p-channel charge transport characteristics when used as the active semiconductor in organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) devices in ambient conditions. The highest hole mobility of 0.013 cm2 V−1 s−1 is achieved in top contact and bottom-gate OTFT devices for PISD-ANT, whereas polymer PISD-NAP exhibited a hole mobility of 0.004 cm2 V−1 s−1. When these polymer semiconductors were used as a donor and PC71BM as an acceptor in OPV devices, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.13% is obtained for the PISD-ANT polymer.
1 Introduction
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and isoindigo (ID) dyes possess a high photo- and mechanical/thermal stability, and were applied in the form of inks or paints for colouring fibers, plastics and surface coatings earlier.1–6 Recently, DPP7–22 and ID23–34 dyes have been proven to be very promising fused aromatic conjugated blocks for making low band gap donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers. These moieties or dyes are gaining significant attention in the organic electronics community due to their excellent performances both in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) and organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. DPP and ID are both strong electron withdrawing moieties due to their two lactam rings and can be used as strong electron acceptors for making D–A based low band gap polymer semiconductors with deep HOMO levels. The insolubility of the DPP and ID core is due to the strong π–π stacking and the hydrogen atoms at the lactam nitrogens, resulting in strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions. It has been shown that DPP and ID based small molecules and polymers can be solution processable by replacing the hydrogen atom on lactam with straight or branched alkyl side chains. Additionally, the optical and electronic properties of these materials can be tuned by incorporating suitable conjugated blocks (either electron donor or acceptor) adjacent to the DPP or the ID moiety. Recently, we have reported 3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione14–17 and 3,6-di(furan-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione18,19(DPP derivatives) based D–A based low band gap organic semiconductors with hole mobilities of 1 to 1.54 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OTFT devices and 5% power conversion efficiency (PCE) in OPV devices. Following recent reports on (E)-1H,1′H-[3,3′]bindolylidene-2,2′-dione or ID based D–A low band gap organic semiconductors for high performance organic electronic devices by Reynolds and other groups,35 we have also started exploring this potential moiety for designing novel D–A materials. ID is a fused planar aromatic conjugated moiety where two indole heterocycles are combined with a central carbon–carbon double bond in E-configuration. The planar ID acceptor building block has been used comprehensively to combine with other donor building blocks such as thiophene, fluorene, carbazole, phenylene, bithiophene, propylenedioxythiophene, thienothiophene, terthiophene, benzodithiophene and dithienosilole for synthesizing various D–A copolymers.23–34 These copolymers have been used in OTFT and OPV devices due to their higher mobility and higher PCE, respectively. Incorporation of such donor aromatic blocks with ID is expected to enhance intermolecular interactions through π–π stacking and may enhance charge delocalization. Optical, electrochemical, electrical and morphological properties of such D–A copolymer semiconductors are strongly dependant on the nature of the donor moiety inserted in the polymer backbone. In the above cases, ID has been combined mostly with thiophene or thiophene based derivatives. Naphthalene and anthracene are two of the most common and easily available fused acene donor aromatic blocks, which have not been hitherto widely used as comonomers. We recently developed polymeric semiconductors with naphthalene and anthracene combined with DPP furan and these copolymers exhibited mobilities as high as 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OTFTs and a promising PCE around 2.6% in OPV devices.19 Inspired by this performance, we decided to use the electron rich ID conjugated block for making D–A based low band gap copolymers with weak electron deficient blocks naphthalene and anthracene. 2,6-Attachment of naphthalene and anthracene gives the most planar conformation compare to other confirmations (1,4- or 1,5-attachment) and it can achieve the highest extended π-conjugation. Combining the dibromo ID compound with 2,6-bisboronic esters of naphthalene and anthracene via Suzuki coupling gave us poly{N,N′-(2-octyldodecyl)-isoindigo-alt-naphthalene} (PISD-NAP) and poly{N,N′-(2-octyldodecyl)-isoindigo-alt-anthracene} (PISD-ANT) polymers, respectively. PISD-ANT on octyltrichlorosilane (OTS) treated Si/SiO2 substrate showed the highest hole mobility of 0.013 cm2 V−1 s−1 using gold for source and drain electrodes. Bulk heterojunction OPV devices fabricated using PISD-ANT as a donor copolymer with [6,6]phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) as the acceptor gave the highest power conversion efficiencies of 1.13% using a polymer to fullerene ratio of 1:2. This result clearly denotes how commonly available acene blocks can be incorporated into a conjugated backbone using potential electron accepting dyes. The polymer synthesis, optical, electrochemical characterization, device performance (OTFT and OPV) and structure–property correlation are explained in detail.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Syntheses and characterization of polymers
The starting monomer 6,6′-dibromo-N,N′-(2-octyldodecyl)-isoindigo (1) was synthesized according to the literature method.34,35 The synthetic route for novel alternating copolymers poly{N,N′-(2-octyldodecyl)-isoindigo-alt-naphthalene} (PISD-NAP) and poly{N,N′-(2-octyldodecyl)-isoindigo-alt-anthracene} (PISD-ANT) involving an isoindigo unit with naphthalene and anthracene is shown in Scheme 1. Copolymerization was conducted at 80 °C under argon atmosphere for 72 h using compound 6,6′-dibromo-N,N′-(2-octyldodecanyl)-isoindigo (1) with 2,6-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxabrolan-2-yl)naphthalene (2) in the presence of Aliquat 336 as a phase transfer catalyst, Pd(PPh3)4 as an organometallic catalyst, and 2 M K2CO3 as base in toluene via Suzuki coupling. The reaction was terminated by adding the bromobenzene and phenyl boronic acid end capping reagents, respectively, and stirring the reaction mixture for a further 3 h. The polymer reaction mixture was then poured into a mixture of methanol and 2 M HCl and stirred for a few hours to get precipitation of the polymer PISD-NAP with a good yield. The crude polymer PISD-NAP was then subjected to purification in a cellulose thimble via Soxhlet extraction using methanol, acetone, and hexane, respectively, for 24 hours each. The Soxhlet extraction technique removes oligomers and catalytic impurities effectively from the crude polymer sample. The final residue was then extracted with chloroform and precipitated again from methanol, filtered, washed with methanol and dried. Another copolymer, PISD-ANT, was synthesized and purified in exactly the same way as the above method, but using 2,6-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxabrolan-2-yl)anthracene (3) and 6,6′-dibromo-N,N′-(2-octyldodecanyl)-isoindigo (1) starting comonomers. Both copolymers displayed good solution processibility in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, THF, chloroform, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene. These polymers also displayed nice film forming properties and large flakes of polymer films can be formed after precipitating the polymers in methanol as a non-solvent. Purified polymers PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT showed number average molecular weights (Mn) of 74190 g mol−1 and 55270 g mol−1 with polydispersity indices (PDI) of 2.91 and 2.40, respectively, measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at a column temperature of 40 °C with THF as eluent and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) as standard. GPC elution curves for both polymers and their molecular weight details are given in Fig. S5† (Table 1). Molecular weight disparities between PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT polymers are due to the solubility difference arising from shorter to longer conjugated moieties (naphthalene and anthracene) incorporated in the backbone. The thermal stability of the polymers was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen flow. PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT polymers exhibited a 5% weight loss at 364 °C and 348 °C, respectively, which indicates the excellent thermal stability of the polymer semiconductors (see Fig. S6†). DSC characterization was carried out up to 300 °C and no thermal transitions were observed (see Fig. S7†).

2.2 Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT polymers were measured in DCB solutions and as spin coated thin films on glass. The spectra are shown in Fig. 1 (Table 2). All copolymers exhibit wide absorption bands extending from 300 nm to 800 nm. Two absorption peaks in both regions are associated with the π–π* transition band and intramolecular charge transfer between naphthalene/anthracene and ID moieties. Most donor–acceptor based materials exhibit such features in their absorption spectra. PISD-NAP shows two absorption maxima (λmax) at 468 nm and 582 nm in DCB solution whereas PISD-ANT exhibits λmax at 418 nm and 600 nm. Another shoulder peak at 630 nm is observed for PISD-ANT polymer. A wider absorption spectrum profile for PISD-ANT, together with a 18 nm red shift in λmax compared to PISD-NAP copolymer, is indicative of the better light harvesting capabilities of this polymer due to the extended conjugation length of the backbone (anthracene vs. naphthalene). Solid state absorption measurements of these copolymers were measured by spin coating their thin films on glass substrates using DCB solution and are quite similar with those of the solution spectra, as shown in Fig. 2 (Table 2). A slight difference compared to solution data is that the solid-state absorption spectra of the polymers have broader long wavelength edges, indicating weak intermolecular interactions related to π–π stacking. The isoindigo conjugated block contains a weak donating phenylene ring. The absorption maxima of PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT (both in solution and solid state) are blue shifted compared to other reported isoindigo based copolymers in which the ID block is combined with thiophene, bithiophene, propylenedioxythiophene, thienothiophene, terthiophene, benzodithiophene and dithienosilole.23–34 Thiophene and its derivatives are strong donors by nature and once they are combined with strong electron acceptors, such as ID, they result in strong donor–strong acceptor low band gap materials, which causes a decrease in the conjugation. However in the case of PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT, we have used weak electron donating conjugated moieties (weak donors – naphthalene and anthracene) combined with a strong ID acceptor, which produces weak donor–strong acceptor low band gap semiconductors. The absorption maxima of PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT are well matched with other weak donor–ID based low band gap polymers where fluorene and carbazole blocks have been used as comonomers.24 Band gap engineering is strongly dependant on the nature and strength of the donor/acceptor blocks involved in the conjugated backbone according to their ionization potential and electron affinity values, respectively. The optical band gaps, calculated from solid state absorption cut off measurements are found to be 1.80 eV and 1.75 eV for PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT, respectively.

2.3 Redox properties and photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) measurements
An investigation of the electrochemical properties of PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT is important in order to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. These energy levels are critical to the functioning of OTFT and OPV devices. The electrochemical properties were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), as shown in Fig. 2, by using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4) solution of the supporting electrolyte in acetonitrile at room temperature under nitrogen with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Ag/AgCl and polymer coated Pt electrodes were used as reference and working electrodes, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO of the PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT were calculated from the oxidation and reduction onset potentials recorded by voltammogram. Oxidation and reduction onset potentials were determined from the cathodic and anodic peaks via intersecting two tangents drawn with respect to the rising current and baseline charging current. The HOMO and LUMO values were calculated with reference to the ferrocene oxidation onset potential using HOMO = 4.4 eV + Eoxd.onset and LUMO = 4.4 eV + Ered.onset equation for the calculations. The HOMO values for PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT are 5.70 eV and 5.62 eV, respectively, indicating the deep nature of the energy levels with respect to the vacuum level, which is beneficial for oxidative stable devices. A slightly lower HOMO value of PISD-NAP compared to PISD-ANT is due to the electron rich nature of anthracene compared to naphthalene. The LUMO values for PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT from reduction onsets are 3.61 eV and 3.70 eV, respectively. These energy values are quite comparable to the other ID based copolymers and the lower HOMO energy values could be attributed to the electron deficient lactam ring present in the ID unit.5,6 The band gap calculated from the HOMO–LUMO difference of CV data for PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT are 2.09 eV and 1.92 eV, respectively, which are higher than the optical band gaps (1.80 eV and 1.75 eV) obtained from the thin film UV-vis-NIR spectrum. This difference in band gap is attributable to the exciton binding energy of the polymer.36,37 To corroborate the HOMO values calculated from the CV, we also conducted photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) measurements using a spin coated thin film of polymers on glass substrates, as shown in Fig. 3. The calculated HOMO values for PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT by PESA are 5.66 eV and 5.53 eV, respectively, which are in agreement with the CV data. LUMO values calculated using the optical band gap and HOMO values (calculated by PESA) difference for PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT are around 3.86 eV and 3.79 eV, respectively, and these HOMO values calculated by PESA are more practical than CV data due to the use of solid state measurements. We decided to use these materials as donor polymers for OPV application because of their low band gap and lower HOMO energies.

2.4 X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
X-ray diffraction (XRD) is an important tool to investigate the molecular packing and ordering of polymer chains in the solid state. We conducted 2D-XRD experiments on polymer flakes in order to get clear information about π–π stacking and the interlayer spacing distances. Polymer flakes were prepared by dissolving the polymer in chloroform and making its dilute solution in a round bottom flask; later on, the solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator and then a thin layer of polymer deposited on the flask wall was rinsed off with a non-solvent such as methanol. The 2D-XRD images and 2D-XRD diffraction patterns of the PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT copolymers were measured when the incident X-ray was normal to the polymer flakes and are shown in Fig. 4. Both diffractograms exhibit primary (100) and secondary (010) peaks which correspond to the interlayer d-spacing and π–π stacking. The primary peaks located at 2θ = 4.08° and 2θ = 4.22° for PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT correspond to a d-spacing of 21.63 Å and 20.91 Å, respectively. The secondary diffraction peaks for both polymers are rather broad and range from 15 to 28 Å, which may be attributed to the short range order arising from the amorphous regions and some randomly ordered crystalline domains in the polymer. Secondary diffraction maxima peaks for PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT were measured at 2θ = 23.70° and 2θ = 24.42° which are assigned to π–π stacking distances of 3.8 Å and 3.7 Å, respectively. Lower d-spacing and π–π stacking distances for PISD-ANT compared to PISD-NAP are due to the higher conjugation length of the isoindigo–anthracene repeating unit compared to the isoindigo–naphthalene block, which induces better π–π stacking. The lower π–π stacking distance of PISD-ANT is expected to result in a higher performance in OTFT devices. The π–π stacking distances for PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT are slightly higher than earlier reported isoindigo–bithiophene based copolymer PII-2T (3.4 Å to 3.5 Å),26 which is related to the weak electron donating nature of naphthalene and anthracene compared to the strong electron donating bithiophene block used in the conjugated backbone.

2.5 Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) performance and morphology study

PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT based OTFT devices were fabricated using top-contact, bottom-gate device geometry and the transfer and output characteristics for PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT OTFTs measured in air are shown in Fig. 5. The PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT based thin films spin coated from chloroform solution OTFT devices exhibit hole mobilities of 0.003 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.013 cm2 V−1 s−1 on OTS treated Si/SiO2 substrate in air, respectively. When dichlorobenzene solvent was used for the spin coating of PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT on OTS treated Si/SiO2 substrates, 0.0038 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.0032 cm2 V−1 s−1 mobility was recorded, respectively. The higher mobility of PISD-ANT compared to PISD-NAP is due to the smaller π–π stacking distance of PISD-ANT calculated from the XRD measurements (see the XRD analysis section). The on/off ratio, threshold voltage (Vth) and mobility values at various conditions have been listed in Table 3. It is vital to note that the mobility values measured in air indicate the high stability of these materials, which might be due to the lower HOMO values of both polymers (PISD-NAP ∼5.66, PISD-ANT ∼5.53). In most of the earlier reported papers, the isoindigo strong acceptor block is combined with strong donors such as thiophene and bithiophene in their conjugated backbone, which exhibits higher mobility (varying from 0.019 to 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1), whereas in these materials we used weak donors such as naphthalene and anthracene, respectively. Compared to the earlier report on DPP based polymers with naphthalene and anthracene, this performance is lower, which may be due to the large dihedral angle between the isoindigo phenylene unit with naphthalene and anthracene (phenylene–phenylene dihedral angle is larger than thiophene–phenylene). The weak intramolecular interactions between the strong acceptor and weak donor makes these materials more amorphous than strong acceptor and strong donor based conjugated materials. Additionally, distortion in planarity is also caused due to a high dihedral angle between the isoindigo unit and the six member naphthalene/anthracene ring (less orbital overlapping) compared to a five member thiophene or bithiophene heterocyclic ring (more orbital overlapping). A small red shift from solution to solid state absorption of PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT is also the signature of weak intramolecular interactions. Strong D–A interaction and backbone planarity is expected to show better π–π stacking and favors charge carrier transportation. Our observations are in close agreement with the effect of polymer symmetry and backbone curvature on interchain “molecular docking” of isoindigo-based polymers and their device performance.38 The morphological behavior of PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) using spin coated thin films (similar to the device fabrication conditions) on Si/SiO2 substrates. The AFM height and phase images of the thin films for PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT are shown in Fig. 6a and b, respectively. AFM images of both polymers exhibit a more amorphous nature with small crystalline domains, which resemble a nodular morphology. PISD-ANT shows more big grains with fewer voids, which make the interconnecting network of nodular morphology more pronounced compared to the PISD-NAP polymer. Such morphological observations are more similar to an earlier reported isoindigo based IIDT polymer where the isoindigo unit was combined with thiophene blocks.26 The conjugated backbones of PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT are constructed with strong acceptors and weak donors, which might be responsible for the amorphous nature. Additionally, distortion in the conjugated backbone plane causes slight deviation in molecular orbital overlapping. Strong intermolecular π–π interactions and donor–acceptor intramolecular interactions are usually responsible for getting very high mobility in OTFT devices.

2.6 Organic photovoltaic (OPV) device study and blend morphology
After evaluating PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT polymers for stable OTFT applications, we decided to use these materials as active semiconductors for OPV devices due to their wide absorption range and promising mobility values. The photovoltaic devices were fabricated and investigated by using a blend of PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT with PC71BM (1:2) using various conditions, such as thermal annealing and the usage of additives. The UV-vis absorption spectra of PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT copolymers blended with PCBM as a pristine, chloronaphthalene (CN), and diiodooctane (DIO) additive added spin coated thin film are shown in Fig. 7. From this optical data, it is clear that the absorption profile of the polymer:PCBM blend is quite different from that of the polymer. After addition of DIO as a processing additive, the relative intensity ratio of the two peaks in the absorption spectrum is higher than the neat film and the film with CN additive. Such kind of change in the absorption profile is related to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) enhancement. The IPCE spectra of the devices are depicted in Fig. 8 and we have clearly noticed the effect of processing additives for enhancing EQE response. PISD-ANT based OPV devices exhibited three times higher EQE response than PISD-NAP based devices due to the better light harvesting capability and higher charge carrier mobility. This has been also proved by showing the differences in hole mobility values of both polymers when they are used in OTFT devices. Photovoltaic results of the respective devices are summarized in Table 4 and their current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 9. In general, PISD-ANT based devices showed much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than those devices based on the PISD-NAP polymer. The higher performance was mainly attributed to the larger short circuit current (Jsc) generated, which was related to the better absorption and higher mobility of the PISD-ANT polymer.

As photovoltaic performance is known to be affected by film morphologies, next, the morphology of the various films were studied using AFM operating in the tapping mode. The topological and phase images were shown in Fig. 10. It was found that devices based on PISD-ANT/PCBM showed smaller domain size than that of PISD-NAP/PCBM. Smaller domain sizes imply that there is more interface available in the PISD-ANT/PCBM films for exciton dissociation. This can be translated to higher Jsc compared to PISD-NAP devices. Hence, the better device performance given by the PISD-ANT/PCBM films can be correlated with this improved morphology. Processing additives such as CN and DIO were also added to fine tune the nanostructures of the active layers. The best performance device was based on PISD-ANT/PCBM in DCB (with 2.5% v/v CN), which had a PCE of 1.13%, with a Jsc of 4.51 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.70, and FF of 0.36.

3 Conclusion
A series of copolymers containing isoindigo strong acceptor combined with naphthalene and anthracene weak donors have been designed and synthesized by palladium-catalyzed classical Suzuki polycondensation. Poly{N,N′-(2-octyldodecyl)-isoindigo-alt-naphthalene} (PISD-NAP) and poly{N,N′-(2-octyldodecyl)-isoindigo-alt-anthracene} (PISD-ANT) were obtained in a good yield with good film forming properties. The optical and electrochemical band gaps calculated for PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT are 1.80 eV and 1.75 eV respectively. The HOMO values for PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT were determined using cyclic voltammetry and photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) and found to be in good agreement. The HOMO values are in the range of 5.53 eV to 5.66 eV for both polymers, indicating the oxidative stability of these materials. Upon testing these polymers in OTFT devices at ambient conditions (in air), the polymer exhibits excellent p-channel charge transport characteristics. The highest hole mobility of 0.013 cm2 V−1 s−1 is achieved in top contact and bottom-gate OTFT devices for PISD-ANT, whereas the polymer PISD-NAP showed a hole mobility of 0.004 cm2 V−1 s−1. Additionally, these polymers also demonstrated promising performance in organic photovoltaic devices when combined with PC71BM as an acceptor. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.13% is obtained for the PISD-ANT polymer. The promising performances of these materials in both OTFTs and OPV devices at ambient conditions makes isoindigo a very promising conjugated moiety for constructing a variety of new stable polymer semiconductors.
4 Experimental
4.1 General
All the reagents and solvents were purchased from Strem, Acros, and Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. All reactions were carried out using the Schlenk technique in an argon or nitrogen atmosphere with anhydrous solvents.
4.2 Characterization

1H and 13C NMR data were performed on a Bruker DPX 400 MHz spectrometer with chemical shifts referenced to residual CHCl3 and H2O in CDCl3. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis against polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) standards was performed in THF at 40 °C on a Waters high pressure GPC assembly with an M590 pump (model 2690), μ-Styragel columns of 105, 104, 103, 500 and 100 Å and a refractive index (RI) detector. A typical concentration of 1.5 mg weight of polymer dissolved in 1 mL of THF was used for running GPC samples. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu model 2501-PC. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed using an Autolab potentiostat (model PGSTAT30) by Echochimie. All CV measurements were recorded in solid state with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte (scan rate of 100 mV s−1). The experiments were performed at room temperature with a conventional three-electrode configuration consisting of a platinum disc working electrode, a gold counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out under nitrogen on a TA Instrument DSC Q100 instrument (scanning rate of 10 °C min−1). Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a TA Instrument TGA Q500 instrument (heating rate of 10 °C min−1).
Core compound 6,6′-dibromoisoindigo is the fully conjugated and most important functional derivative for synthesizing various conjugated semiconductors. This compound can be obtained easily in quantitative yield from the acid catalyzed aldol condensation of 6-bromoisatin and 6-bromooxindole refluxed in acetic acid under argon, reported by Reynolds et al.35 In order to induce good solubility, an octyldodecyl group was attached to the ID core. The nitrogen atom of the compound was alkylated by using branched 2-octyldodecyl bromide in anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent in the presence of potassium carbonate (K2CO3), producing compound 6,6′-dibromo-N,N′-(2-octyldodecanyl)-isoindigo in 74% yield after column chromatography (see 1H and 13C NMR Fig. S1 and S2 spectra†). This dibromo derivative (compound 1) was used as a common block for polymerization with other bisboronic esters of naphthalene and anthracene, respectively. Naphthalene and anthracene bisboronic esters were prepared from their dibromo analogues using bis(pinacolato)diboron and potassium acetate in the presence of Pd(II), according to the literature method (see 1H and 13C NMR Fig. S3 and S4 spectra†).19
4.3 Synthesis of poly{N,N′-(2-octyldodecyl)-isoindigo-alt-naphthalene} (PISD-NAP)
To a 50 mL Schlenk flask, 6,6′-dibromo-N,N′-(2-octyldodecanyl)-isoindigo (4) (0.300 g, 0.30 mmol) and 2,6-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxabrolan-2-yl)naphthalene (5) (0.114 g 0.30 mmol), 2 M aqueous K2CO3 solution (5 mL) and 2 drops of Aliquat 336 were dissolved in toluene (15 mL). The solution was purged with argon for 30 min, and then tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (20 mg, 0.012 mmol) was added in the above solution quickly. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 3 days. Then, a toluene solution of phenyl boronic acid was added and the mixture was stirred for an additional 4 h, followed by addition of a few drops of bromobenzene and stirring overnight. The resulting mixture was poured into a mixture of methanol and water and stirred for a few hours. The resulting solid was filtered off and subjected to Soxhlet extraction for 2 days in methanol, acetone, and hexane for the removal of oligomers and catalytic impurities. The remaining polymer was extracted with chloroform and precipitated again from methanol, filtered, washed with methanol, and dried under vacuum at room temperature (78% yield). Mw/Mn (GPC) = 74190/215969. UV-vis: 468, 582 nm (in chloroform).
4.4 Synthesis of poly{N,N′-(2-octyldodecyl)-isoindigo-alt-anthracene} (PISD-ANT)
To a 50 mL Schlenk flask, 6,6′-dibromo-N,N′-(2-octyldodecanyl)-isoindigo (4) (0.300 g, 0.30 mmol) and 2,8-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxabrolan-2-yl)anthracene (6) (0.124 g, 0.30 mmol), 2 M aqueous K2CO3 solution (6 mL) and 2 drops of Aliquat 336 were dissolved in toluene (12 mL). The solution was purged with argon for 30 min, and then tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (20 mg, 0.017 mmol) was added. The reaction was stirred at 80 °C for 3 days. Then, a toluene solution of phenyl boronic acid was added and the mixture was stirred for an additional 4 h, followed by addition of a few drops of bromobenzene and stirring overnight. The resulting mixture was poured into a mixture of methanol and water and stirred for a few hours. The resulting solid was filtered off and subjected to Soxhlet extraction for 2 days in methanol, acetone, and hexane for the removal of oligomers and catalytic impurities. The remaining polymer was extracted with chloroform and precipitated again from methanol, filtered, washed with methanol, and dried under vacuum at room temperature (62% yield). Mw/Mn (GPC) = 55276/132786. UV-vis: 418, 600 nm (in chloroform).
4.5 OTFT fabrication and characterization
Top-contact, bottom-gate OTFT test devices were prepared on a silicon wafer in ambient conditions without taking any special precautions to exclude air, moisture and ambient light. A heavily n-doped silicon wafer with a 220 nm surface layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) was used as the substrate/gate electrode, with the top SiO2 layer serving as the gate dielectric (capacitance 15.6 nF cm−2). The SiO2 surface of the Si wafer substrate was cleaned by sonication in acetone, and then immersed in piranha solution (volume ratio of H2SO4 to H2O2 was 2:1) for 8 minutes at room temperature. The cleaned wafer was then immersed in a 0.1 M solution of octyltrichlorosilane (OTS-8) in toluene at 60 °C for 30 min, followed by rinsing with toluene and then drying with N2. It has been shown by many groups that the self assembled monolayer (SAM) of OTS on Si/SiO2 substrate regulates the surface energy and is often responsible for better molecular organization and ordering of appropriate organic and polymeric semiconductors. Additionally, such surface treatment has been shown to reduce the trap density of states which controls charge transport. The semiconductor layer (PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT polymeric thin films of 8 mg mL−1 in chloroform) was deposited on top of the OTS-8-modified SiO2 surface by spin coating. PISD-NAP and PISD-ANT thin films deposited on Si/SiO2 were optionally annealed on a hotplate at 100 and 150 °C, respectively at ambient conditions. Subsequently, on top of the polymer active layer, 50 nm thick gold (Au) was deposited for source (S) and drain (D) electrodes through a shadow mask. Silicon oxide at the backside of the silicon wafer of the TFT device was removed with sandpaper to provide a conductive gate contact. The TFT devices were then characterized using a Keithley SCS-4200 probe station under an ambient environment with a relative humidity level of 65%. The field effect mobility (μ) was calculated from the saturation regime of the transfer characteristics. The charge carrier mobility values were calculated from the saturation regime of the OTFT transfer characteristics from eqn (1). (1)where W and L are the channel width and length, respectively, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the insulation layer. Channel width and channel length for these devices are 15 μm and 4 mm, respectively.
4.6 OPV fabrication and its characterization
For solar cell device fabrication, indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were purchased from Kintec. The glass/ITO substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in subsequent baths of detergent (15 min), de-ionized water (15 min), acetone (15 min), and isopropanol (15 min). The substrates were then subjected to air plasma cleaning for 2 minutes prior to the spin coating of a 30 nm thick PEDOT:PSS hole transporting layer (Clevios P VP AI 4083). The ITO/glass substrates with PEDOT:PSS were baked at 140 °C for 10 min in a glovebox. The active layers of, PISD-NAP:[70]PCBM and PISD-ANT:[70]PCBM using 1:2 ratios were spin coated on PEDOT:PSS deposited ITO glass using dichlorobenzene. An aluminum cathode was deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask under a vacuum pressure of 10−6 Torr to complete the devices, giving a device area of 0.07 cm2. The IPCE (incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency) was measured using a Merlin radiometer (Newport) with a monochromator-calibrated wavelength control; the incident light intensity was determined by a calibrated Si photodiode (Hamamatsu). The current–voltage characteristics were measured using an Agilent 4155C Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer under simulated AM 1.5G illumination, while irradiance was provided by a 96000 solar simulator (Xenon lamp, Newport Oriel). The simulator lamp intensity was set using a single crystalline silicon reference cell.
