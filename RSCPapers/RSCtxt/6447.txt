Soc., Perkin Trans. 2, 1984, 2023-2026Photogalvanic and cyclic voltammetric studies of the effect of complexing agents on aqueous iron(II)—a new methylene blue system(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )Adurthy S. N. Murthy and Konda S. ReddyAbstractThe effect of complexing agents KH2PO4, NH4HF2, and EDTA on the photopotential and photocurrents of a few FeII–dye photogalvanic systems has been examined. The photogalvanic outputs have been found to be enhanced in the presence of KH2PO4. The conclusions are supported by detailed cyclic voltammetric studies.
