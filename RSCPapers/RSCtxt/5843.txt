    , Accepted 11th November 2020First published on 12th November 2020AbstractThe crystallinity of a perovskite film can play a key role in the photovoltaic performance and long-term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we introduce 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) into perovskite on the reduction-active poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transport layer and maximize its morphology-regulating effect via enhancing the concentration of CH3NH3I used in the two-step spin-coating. Since the high concentration iodine methylamine increases the oxidation potential, a perovskite film with large grains can be obtained. Furthermore, we proposed using a small amount of tBP with a high concentration of CH3NH3I and found that it would form a gradient structure in the perovskite. A small amount of tBP in CH3NH3I can further enhance its diffusion mobility into PbI2 films. Moreover, tBP in perovskite with a gradient structure can further induce coordination between tBP and perovskite, leading to considerably large perovskite grains (∼1.4 μm) with defect-free morphology. The perovskite grains can be more completely surrounded by the stronger hydrophobic tBP. Therefore, both the efficiencies and moisture stabilities of the PSCs can be significantly enhanced. PSCs without encapsulation could even maintain more than 80% of their initial PCE after 400 h of moisture exposure (RH ∼50%). Moreover, the flexible devices after optimization could achieve a PCE of 14.92%, and still maintain at 11.39% after 20 times of mechanical bending.
Introduction
In the past few years, hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have successfully gained attention because of the outstanding photovoltaic performances, low fabrication costs and flexible device applicability.1–6 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has dramatically increased from 3.8% to an amazing 25.5% within just a few years.7–14 Although the rapid development of PSCs is in progress, high-stability devices with low-cost mass-manufacturing and higher efficiency are still the main goal pursued by researchers to advance commercialization. In this regard, several approaches have been carried out including additive incorporation,15–17 interface engineering,18–20 encapsulation techniques,21–23 cation substitution,24–26etc. Though additive incorporation is considered the simplest and most effective strategy to optimize perovskite crystallinity and stability, numerous disadvantages to using high concentration additives in perovskites still exist such as poor charge transmission and non-tunable band gaps. Moreover, additive effects are still limited owing to the rapid saturation of all the available bonding sites.27 To overcome the above issues, strengthening the additive effects on perovskites with lower additive concentrations might be an ideal option.
In addition to the additive optimization, the poor moisture resistance of perovskite is another troublesome issue for researchers, which makes the use of a glove box inevitable for most high-efficiency PSC fabrication. The use of a glove box during PSC fabrication might seriously hinder mass-manufacturing and the commercial potential. To solve this problem, 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) was introduced into the perovskite precursor to both improve the photovoltaic performances and moisture stabilities of the PSCs.28–33 Owing to the hydrophobic chain in this additive, a significant improvement in the moisture resistance of perovskite can be obtained.28–30 Furthermore, some pyridine derivatives and pyridine-containing compounds have been used by researchers to optimize perovskite materials as hole materials due to their specific chemical properties, thereby improving the performance of the PSCs.34–36 However, the disadvantages of poor charge transmission caused by a high concentration of tBP (or other additives) in perovskites usually hinder the photovoltaic performances of the devices. Wu et al.29 successfully introduced a small amount of tBP into the antisolvent instead of the perovskite precursor to achieve high efficiency PSCs via the formation of a gradient heterojunction structure. The use of a very large amount of toxic antisolvent (>150 μL cm−2) may seriously damage the environment. In addition, it is difficult for tBP to diffuse into the inner perovskite film via antisolvent incorporation, which hampers the optimization of tBP in the perovskite. To enhance the tBP effect on the perovskite with lower amounts of tBP and without antisolvent treatment, introducing a reduction-active PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer (HTL) underneath the perovskite to facilitate tBP coordination might be a good option.34 However, for commercialization and long-term stability, the optimization is still insufficient. Further efforts to enhance tBP coordination with the perovskite are needed.
In this work, we propose a simple strategy to further improve tBP coordination on the base of PEDOT:PSS by enhancing the concentration of CH3NH3I and further introducing tBP into the high concentration CH3NH3I to form a gradient structure. High concentrations of iodine methylamine could largely improve the specific chemical oxidation of the perovskite via the p-doped PEDOT chain from the PEDOT:PSS layer, which can significantly enhance the coordination of tBP with the perovskite. Further insertion of a very small amount of tBP into CH3NH3I and depositing it on porous PbI2 can form a tBP gradient distribution in the perovskite layer. The tBP effect with this gradient distribution (dense inside) in perovskite can be more effectively strengthened. A very large perovskite grain (∼1.4 μm) can be obtained by using less tBP additive (only about 30–40% compared with other studies28–30,37), which indicates that the tBP coordination (morphology regulating effect) to the perovskite is improved. For the simplest ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3-tBP/PC61BM/Ag PSC, the PCE and the fill factor (FF) were enhanced to 18.91% and 0.81 on a glass substrate and to 14.92% and 0.73 on a flexible PET substrate, respectively. In addition, the moisture stabilities of the PSCs were significantly improved since the perovskite grains were surrounded by the stronger hydrophobic tBP. The optimized PSCs without encapsulation could even maintain more than 80% of their initial PCE after 400 h of moisture exposure (RH ∼50%). Moreover, the fabrication procedure can be performed well without the use of a glovebox and in ambient air (relative humidity >40%), which implies greater advances for the applicability and mass-manufacturing.
Experimental
Materials
CH3NH3I (MAI) and PbI2 were supplied by Jiangsu Yanchang Sunlaite New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) were supplied by Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Glass/ITO and PET/ITO were purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd. Other materials were purchased from Aladdin.
Devices fabrication
Inverted-planar rigid and flexible perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) were fabricated on laser-patterned, indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass and PET substrates (10 Ω sq−1), respectively. Both of them were sequentially ultrasonically cleaned with de-ionized water, acetone, ethyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol for 15 min followed by high temperature drying with nitrogen and treating in a UV ozone oven for 20 min. After the above cleaning procedure, a thin layer of compact PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on the clean substrates at 2000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s in turn, and then annealed at 120 °C for 1 h. The PbI2 precursor (1.2 M, dissolved in DMF and stirred for 1 h at 70 °C) without or with 40 μL mL−1 of tBP were continuously spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS substrate at 4500 rpm for 30 s and dried at 70 °C for 15 min. Upon the formation of dried PbI2 or PbI2·tBP film, different concentrations of CH3NH3I (dissolved in IPA, 8 mg mL−1, 12 mg mL−1, 16 mg mL−1, and 20 mg mL−1) with and without tBP (0.8%, volume ratio) at 15 °C was individually spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s to form perovskite and annealed at 100 °C for 1 h. For the electron transport layer, PC61BM (20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 80 °C for 1 h. Finally, the fabrications were finished by thermally evaporating Ag to form the electrodes with the thickness of about 100 nm and the effective area of 0.06 cm2. All the details for the procedure above are illustrated in Fig. 1.

Characterization
The crystal structures of PbI2 and MAPbI3 were examined using an X-ray measurement (XRD, Thermo ARL-X’TRA, America) with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å). A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Ultra55, ZEISS, Germany) was employed to examine the morphology. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of cells were achieved using a Keithley Model 2400-SCS Source Meter under AM 1.5 illumination. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption was characterized by a UV-Visible Spectrophotometer (Lambda 900, America). The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was obtained by a quantum efficiency (QE)/IPCE test system (Solar Cell Scan100/Zolix). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were investigated by the electrochemical workstation (Zennium Pro, Germany). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL) were obtained by a PG2000-Pro-EX spectrophotometer (Shanghai Ideaoptics Corporation) and a transient fluorescence spectrometer (FLS980, Edinburgh Instruments, EI), respectively. The contact properties were carried out using a contact-angle instrument (Krüss Optronic, Germany). X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a K-Alpha instrument.
Results and discussion
The high crystallinity of the films is usually a key character in high-efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we introduced 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) into the PbI2 precursor on the reduction-active poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) flexible hole transport layer and spin-coated a high concentration of CH3NH3I on it to largely facilitate the tBP morphology-regulation effect on the perovskite. Fig. 1 demonstrates the discrepancy between the conventional and proposed tBP-induced PbI2 and perovskite films. The PbI2 film without tBP incorporation shows a compact layered dense morphology as depicted in Fig. 1a, which is due to the high volatility of DMF.38 This dense morphology of PbI2 film would hardly convert into perovskite completely after the two-step CH3NH3I spin coating, leading to defects and pinhole issues for the perovskite films. In contrast, the PbI2 film with tBP incorporation demonstrates free-standing porous morphology as shown in Fig. 1b. The formation of this highly porous structure is due to the coordination of tBP with the center Pb2+ in PbI2, which hinders the nucleation of the PbI2 clusters.29–31,39 Fig. S1† shows the XRD analysis for PbI2 films with or without tBP insertion, respectively. For the PbI2·xtBP film, the characteristic diffraction peaks at 6.8° and 13.6° were observed in addition to the diffraction peaks of pure PbI2, which certifies that tBP could strongly coordinate with PbI2 to form a porous PbI2·tBP film. This highly porous morphology of PbI2·tBP is beneficial to the complete conversion of the perovskite after spin-coating CH3NH3I since it offers an enlarged reaction area for CH3NH3I infiltration. The water-contact-angle experimental results in Fig. S2† also demonstrate the existence and higher hydrophobicity of the PbI2·xtBP film, which significantly enhances the moisture resistance and stability of the device. Fig. 1d shows the top-view image of the tBP-induced perovskite film, whose formation was facilitated by the porous PbI2·tBP film and the high concentration of the two-step CH3NH3I spin-coating. The considerably compact and defect-less perovskite film could be obtained with the huge grain sizes larger than 1.2 μm. This observable change of perovskite morphology by the insertion of tBP and high concentration of CH3NH3I could greatly enhance the photovoltaic performance and long-term stability of the flexible PSCs. Fig. S3† shows the lower-magnification SEM image of the perovskite film treated by tBP and high concentration CH3NH3I on the reduction-active PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer, which shows uniform large grains of the perovskite.
To certify and understand why the tBP-induced perovskite treated by a high concentration of CH3NH3I on the reduction-active PEDOT:PSS has better performance, a series of SEM and XPS analyses were performed. Fig. 2a–d shows the top-view images of CH3NH3PbI3·tBP films treated by different concentrations of CH3NH3I in the range of 8–20 mg mL−1 in ambient air, respectively. For the CH3NH3I concentration at 8 mg mL−1, a small particle morphology full of defects was observed, similar with the typical perovskite that is not treated by tBP additive. This implies weak coordination and the morphology-regulation effect by tBP on the perovskite. With the increase in concentration of CH3NH3I to 12 mg mL−1, a pinhole-free perovskite film with larger grain sizes of about 1 μm can be observed. Further increasing the CH3NH3I content to 16 mg mL−1 would lead to a considerably compact and defect-free perovskite film with grain sizes larger than 1.2 μm. This demonstrates the significant enhancement of the morphology-regulation effect in the tBP-induced perovskite via the reduction-active PEDOT:PSS layer. As for PEDOT:PSS, the PEDOT chain is highly p-doped via oxidation, which indicates that the PEDOT:PSS layer is intrinsically reduction-active. PEDOT:PSS could be easily chemically reduced by amine groups including methylamine,40 tetrakis(dimethylamine)ethylene41 and polyethylenimine.42,43 Hence, producing a tBP-doped perovskite with a higher concentration of iodine methylamine could significantly strengthen the chemical oxidation of the perovskite via the reduction-active PEDOT:PSS, leading to a large change in the work function and ionization potential of the perovskite.37,43 This considerable change could significantly enhance the coordination (morphology-regulation) between tBP and CH3NH3PbI3. It is noteworthy that no further considerable morphology improvements could be observed with CH3NH3I concentrations larger than 16 mg mL−1, which implies that 16 mg mL−1 is the threshold concentration for the morphology optimization. Fig. 2e and f show the XPS analysis to certify the tBP coordination to Pb2+ in CH3NH3PbI3·tBP films treated by different concentrations of CH3NH3I. The inset in Fig. 1 shows the structure of the tBP functional group and its coordination with the perovskite. The experimental results demonstrate that the binding energy of Pb 4f7/2 in perovskite shifted to a lower energy level from 138.93 eV to 138.62 eV for CH3NH3PbI3·tBP treated with higher concentrations of CH3NH3I, which implies the stronger coordination (morphology-regulation) of tBP with the perovskite and formation of a more compact perovskite film with larger-sized grains.

(e) Overall XPS spectra, and (f) Pb 4f7/2 XPS spectra of pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3·tBP treated by different concentrations of CH3NH3I (12, 16 mg mL−1). 
To further improve the morphology regulation and electron diffusion in the perovskite, a very small amount of tBP (0.8%, volume ratio) was introduced into the high concentration (16 mg mL−1) CH3NH3I and spin-coated onto porous PbI2·tBP on the reduction-active PEDOT:PSS layer to form a tBP gradient structure. Fig. 3a–c show the top-view images of the CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP films with different concentrations of the tBP additive in PbI2 (40 and 60 μL mL−1) and (40 μL mL−1 in PbI2 and 0.8% in CH3NH3I), respectively. The corresponding grain size distribution statistics are shown in Fig. S4.† Compact and pinhole-free morphology of perovskite films could be obtained for CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP films with tBP additive in 40 and 60 μL mL−1 owing to the morphology-regulation effect by the incorporation of tBP. It should be noticeable that no further morphology optimization occurs as the tBP concentration increases to 60 μL mL−1, which implies that 40 μL mL−1 is the threshold concentration for the morphology optimization. Moreover, a higher concentration of tBP might cause unfavourable electric resistances and hinder the photovoltaic performances of the PSCs.34 However, for CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP films with the tBP additive in 40 μL mL−1 in PbI2 and 0.8% in CH3NH3I, further optimization of the perovskite morphology with grain sizes more than 1.4 μm can be achieved as shown in Fig. 3c. This achievement could be attributed to the small amount of tBP in CH3NH3I that can provide great diffusion mobility to penetrate into PbI2 and enhance the crystal grains by retarding the perovskite crystallization rate. The XRD experimental results in Fig. S5† demonstrate that the flat PbI2 film spin-coated by tBP-incorporated CH3NH3I shows smaller residue PbI2 characteristic peaks, which certifies the improved diffusion mobility of tBP-incorporated CH3NH3I to convert PbI2 into CH3NH3PbI3 more efficiently. Additionally, the high porosity of the PbI2·tBP film can work as a mesoscopic substrate for a better scaffold and contact area for tBP-incorporated CH3NH3I infiltration, leading to the significant diffusion mobility and morphology-regulation effect. Fig. 3d shows the theoretical models of CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP films facilitated by different morphologies of PbI2, which implies that the porous morphology of the PbI2·tBP film can further enhance the diffusion mobility of tBP-incorporated CH3NH3I, leading to considerably smooth, defect-less and very large grain sized films. The schematic shown in Fig. 3e further explains the effect of the tBP-incorporated CH3NH3I spin-coated on porous PbI2. The porous morphology of PbI2 can result in a higher concentration of tBP in the inner side of PbI2 and form a gradient structure in the perovskite layer. The coordination between tBP and perovskite can be further enhanced since the tBP distribution is more concentrated and closer to the reduction-active PEDOT:PSS layer, which is beneficial for PEDOT:PSS oxidation facilitation of the tBP additive. Thus, the perovskite grains can be more optimized and completely surrounded by hydrophobic tBP, leading to higher efficiency and moisture stability of the device.

The series of perovskite compositions and the photovoltaic performances of the PSCs with and without optimization were investigated. Fig. 4a shows the XRD patterns for conventional CH3NH3PbI3, and CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP with CH3NH3I concentrations of 12, 16 mg mL−1 and 16 mg mL−1 with 0.8% tBP, respectively. The complete conversion of perovskite could be achieved by spin-coating different concentrations of CH3NH3I on the porous PbI2·tBP films, and no PbI2 residue XRD peaks could be detected for the CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP films. In addition, higher peak intensities of CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP were observed, especially for CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP with a CH3NH3I concentration of 16 mg mL−1 with 0.8% tBP, which indicates the significant improvement of perovskite crystallization. Fig. 4b shows J–V curves of the different types of inverted-planar rigid PSCs. The PSC fabricated without tBP treatment exhibits a very low PCE of 2.91%. In contrast, all CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP-based PSCs show excellent photovoltaic performances, especially for that treated by a CH3NH3I concentration of 16 mg mL−1 with 0.8% tBP, which shows the greatest efficiency with Voc = 1.01 V, Jsc = 23.15 mA cm2, FF = 0.81, and PCE = 18.91%. The significant enhancement in PCE can be attributed to the high crystallinity of the CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP caused by greater tBP coordination with perovskite (facilitated by the high concentration of CH3NH3I) and tBP gradient structure in perovskite. The detailed information about short-circuit density, open-circuit voltage and fill factor of each PSC are all listed in Table S1.†Fig. 4c demonstrates the increases in external IPCE and the integrated Jsc for the devices are 9.13, 20.78 and 22.08 mA cm−2, respectively, which is very close to the Jsc from the J–V curves and in agreement with previous results. The statistical device PCEs of 3 sets of 20 PSC devices each with conventional CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP with CH3NH3I concentration in 12 mg mL−1 and 16 mg mL−1 with 0.8% tBP were also investigated and are shown in Fig. 4d. The experimental results imply that not only higher efficiency, but also better reproducibility could be achieved, which greatly overcome the reproducibility issues and advance the PSC applicability to a new extent.

(b) The J–V curves; (c) IPCEs and corresponding integrated Jsc and (d) statistical device performances of PSCs prepared under different conditions: conventional CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP with CH3NH3I concentration in 12 mg mL−1 and 16 mg mL−1 with 0.8% tBP, respectively. 
To get further insight into the improvements of the devices, UV-vis absorption and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5a, compared to the perovskite film prepared by conventional CH3NH3PbI3, both CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP films prepared by a CH3NH3I concentration of 12 mg mL−1 and 16 mg mL−1 with 0.8% tBP can lead to a stronger absorbance due to the larger grain sizes and defect-less morphologies. Fig. 5b shows the characteristic Nyquist patterns and fitting model of the PSCs fabricated by conventional CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP with CH3NH3I concentration in 12 mg mL−1 and 16 mg mL−1 with 0.8% tBP. The main arcs in the low-frequency region represent the electron–hole recombination resistance (Rct), which the fitting value is increased from 1556 Ω to 1667 Ω. This further confirms that the perovskite film with better crystallinity can block the disadvantages of electron–hole recombination. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of films fabricated by conventional CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP with a CH3NH3I of concentration in 12 mg mL−1 and 16 mg mL−1 with 0.8% tBP were also investigated, and the perovskite films were deposited on the PEDOT:PSS film and the excitation light was incident from the ITO side. It is clear that the PL intensities decreased especially for CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP with a CH3NH3I concentration of 16 mg mL−1 with 0.8% tBP as shown in Fig. 5c, which indicates that it possesses better interfacial contact and hole transfer. In order to further reveal the hole extraction capability between the perovskite layer and HTL, the time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra are provided in Fig. 5d. The TRPL spectra are fitted by the biexponential decay function: (1)

Generally, the fast decay constant τ1 is related to the free carrier quenching at the interface, while the slow decay constant τ2 will affect the radiative recombination of the carriers. The average decay lifetime can be calculated according to the equation of  detailed parameters are listed in Table S2.† The experimental results show that the high concentration of CH3NH3I solution with incorporated tBP results in a reduced τavg from 23.8 ns to 16.5 ns, which is consistent with previous results. The decrease of the decay lifetime can explain the superior hole carrier-extraction capability due to the high-quality perovskite film with a lower trap-state density, which can improve the photovoltaic performance of the device.44,45
The trap-state density in perovskite films were further verified by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) technique, which was applied to the HTL-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. Dark J–V curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 5e. The trap-state density (Ntrap) is determined by the equation: (2)where ε is the relative dielectric constant of perovskite, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, e is the electron charge, and L is the thickness of perovskite films.46 The trap-state densities of perovskite films fabricated by conventional CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP with a CH3NH3I concentration of 12 mg mL−1 and 16 mg mL−1 with 0.8% tBP are calculated to be 1.15 × 1016, 1.04 × 1016 and 0.88 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. The perovskite film treated by CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP with a CH3NH3I concentration of 16 mg mL−1 with 0.8% tBP shows a much smaller VTFL than that of other films, indicating the optimization of the perovskite film was successful with a lower trap-state density. In addition, the light intensity dependent Voc for the three kinds of devices was investigated to analyze the charge carrier recombination. Details are shown in Fig. 5f. The slope of Vocversus log-scaled light intensity is kT/q. Here, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature and q are the elementary charge. The lowest slope for the PSCs fabricated by CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP with a CH3NH3I concentration of 16 mg mL−1 with 0.8% tBP is 1.57 kT/q, which is lower than that of the other two devices. The result indicates that the trap-state density is effectively suppressed.47
The moisture stabilities (RH ∼50%) of the different devices were also investigated as shown in Fig. 6. The PSCs fabricated without tBP incorporation showed a very poor moisture resistance, a very fast reduction in performance and reached 0% after 200 h, which indicates poor applicability and commercial potential for the conventional PSCs. In contrast, PSCs fabricated with tBP optimization have largely enhanced moisture stabilities. The PCE can maintain 60% after 400 h of moisture exposure. This is due to the coordination between the nitrogen atom at the end of tBP and Pb2+ in CH3NH3PbI3, leading to a surrounding hydrophobic tertiary butyl group of tBP.35,37 The water-contact-angle measurements in Fig. 6 also reveal that the water contact angle can increase from 52.7° to 67.8° after the tBP incorporation, which shows higher hydrophobicity of the CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP film. Further enhancing tBP coordination by treating with a high concentration of CH3NH3I with 0.8% tBP can improve the moisture stabilities of the PSCs to a new extent. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, PSCs fabricated with a high concentration of CH3NH3I with 0.8% tBP can maintain more than 80% of their initial PCE even after 400 h of moisture exposure. The water contact angle could also be further increased to 71.9° to show higher hydrophobicity. The larger water contact angle is mainly owing to the hydrophobic tBP, which exists on the surface and interface of perovskite film. In addition, the previous reports of Liu et al. also show that the tBP can be anchored on the surface of CH3NH3PbI3.30 This implies that not only higher efficiencies, but also better moisture stabilities can be achieved after optimizing tBP coordination with the perovskite.
 Fig. 6  Device stability of fabricated PSCs without encapsulation with pristine CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI3·xtBP film with CH3NH3I concentration in 12 mg mL−1 and 16 mg mL−1 with 0.8% tBP, respectively. Insets show the water contact angle measurements for each PSC. 
To advance the application of planar-structured PSCs, great photovoltaic performance of the device after repeated mechanical bending is also important. Here, we replaced the rigid substrate of the devices with the flexible PET/ITO substrate and investigated the photovoltaic performance and mechanical bending tolerance of each device. Fig. 7a depicts the J–V curves of flexible tBP-induced PSCs (treated by high concentrations of CH3NH3I with 0.8% tBP) before and after different times of mechanical bending, respectively. The inset shows the photograph of a flexible PSC without encapsulation. The photovoltaic performance of the flexible PSC can still perform well with Voc = 0.97 V, Jsc = 21.21 mA cm−2, FF = 0.73, and PCE = 14.92%, which keeps about 79% of the rigid one. The decrease in the Jsc and FF is because of the higher series resistance of the flexible devices. The mechanical bending tolerance of the flexible PSCs with each perovskite was also monitored and displayed in Fig. 7b. The PCE could be maintained at 72% even after mechanical bending up to 40 times for the flexible tBP-induced PSCs (treated by high concentrations of CH3NH3I with 0.8% tBP). This demonstrates that the optimized flexible PSCs we made could well-tolerate repeated mechanical deformation. Compared with other flexible PSCs (made by 12 mg mL−1 CH3NH3I solution without tBP), the photovoltaic performance drops to only 58% after the 40 times repeated mechanical deformation. For flexible PSCs with conventional CH3NH3PbI3, the PCE significantly drops to 15%. This indicates that this well-treated device hence could greatly tolerate repeated mechanical deformation, which advances the potential for its wearable applicability and commercialization in the future.

Conclusion
The high photovoltaic performance, moisture stability and repeated mechanical deformation stability of flexible PSC devices can be further optimized to a new extent by maximizing the tBP additive engineering, which involved enhancing the concentration of CH3NH3I used in the two-step spin-coating and further introducing tBP into the high concentrations of CH3NH3I to form a gradient structure. The reduced content of tBP in this study can suppress the negative impact on the perovskite such as the non-tunable band gaps and unfavourable electric resistances, which usually emerge at high concentrations of additives, and lead to excellent photovoltaic performances. The Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE were increased to 23.15 mA cm−2, 1.01 V, 0.81 and 18.91%, which was much better than previous studies. Furthermore, the enhanced hydrophobicity of tBP can further improve the moisture stabilities of devices, which largely enhance its commercial potential. The flexible device was also fabricated and achieved a PCE of 14.92%. In addition, this flexible PSC can better tolerate the repeated mechanical bending, which advances the universal applicability.
