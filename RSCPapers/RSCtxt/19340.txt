1. Introduction and historical development
Porphyrins are a class of naturally occurring macrocyclic compounds, playing a very important role in a diversity of biological processes, including cell respiration, detoxification of xenobiotics, oxygen transport, fatty acid oxidation and light harvesting.1,2 The study of synthetic porphyrins has gained particular interest due to potential applications of these compounds in areas such as catalysis,3 optical sensors,4 electronic devices,5 supramolecular systems,6 photovoltaic cells,7 solar energy conversion8 and medicine.9
Porphyrins fused with aromatic units10 have recently emerged as a hot topic of research,11–18 in particular porphyrins bearing benzene rings fused at the β-pyrrolic positions.19–21 These compounds are called benzoporphyrins and the focus of the present review will be the tetrabenzoporphyrins (TBPs) which have four fused rings (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Basic structure of a porphyrin and a benzoporphyrin. 
In general these compounds have a UV-Vis absorption spectrum similar to porphyrins, however, depending on the number of benzene rings, the range of absorption Q bands is red-shifted to 600–750 nm. This property, coupled with the fact that they are good singlet oxygen generators, puts benzoporphyrins, and analogous compounds in a privileged position with respect to their therapeutic application.22
Tetrabenzoporphyrins (TBPs) were first synthesized by Helberger et al. in 1938,23 and later in 1940–1950 by Linstead et al.24,25 These studies were conducted after work developed by the same authors on the synthesis of phthalocyanines. Since then, five main methods for preparing TBPs have been described in the literature: (a) condensation of isoindole precursors; (b) retro-Diels–Alder; (c) oxidative aromatization; (d) one-pot cycloaddition approach with aromatization and (e) one-pot Heck approach with aromatization (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  General synthetic routes to obtain TBPs. 
The condensation of isoindole precursors (Fig. 2) was one of the first methodologies used to obtain TBP type compounds. However, with the development of new synthetic approaches, this method has become impractical, since it furnishes low yields, the formation of many byproducts and requires extreme reaction conditions (e.g. melting at 350–400 °C).22
The retro-Diels–Alder method overcomes some limitations of the previous strategy, and has been used by Ono et al.26–31 to prepare TBPs with different degrees of substitution in the benzene fused rings and in the meso-position phenyl groups.
At the same time, Finikova and co-workers32–34 reported in a pioneering work, the use of the oxidative aromatization method. This approach showed clear advantages over the retro-Diels–Alder method, including the use of cheap and more readily available components. Also it allowed the synthesis of TBPs with different degrees of substitution, representing an extremely versatile strategy (Fig. 2).
Kräutler and co-workers reported the synthesis of “black” TBPs using the direct cycloaddition with sulfoleneporphyrins and benzoquinone.35 More recently Wang et al.36 reported an innovative method based on the Heck reaction, and a one-pot aromatization. The authors started from the β-octabromoporphyrin to obtain TBPs using a sophisticated approach (Fig. 2).
2. Major synthetic methods
The synthesis of TBPs was first described in the 1930's,23 but it was only in the 1990's that the major problems associated with obtaining this kind of compound were better studied. Ono and co-workers published a solution to the problems related with the condensation of the isoindole precursors, namely their instability, the possibility of using only a few inert substituents (e.g. alkyl groups or halogens), low yields, complex and virtually inseparable mixtures, and the low solubility of the TBPs.26
The strategy was called the retro-Diels–Alder method. These authors reported in 199726 a new synthesis of a pyrrole fused with a bicyclic skeleton 3 (Scheme 1) that served as a building block for the construction of the corresponding porphyrin 4a.
 Scheme 1  First syntheses of TBPs by the retro-Diels–Alder method. 
Pyrrole 3 was synthesized by Diels–Alder reaction of β-sulfonylnitroethylene and cyclohexadiene (1) followed by reaction of the β-nitrosulfone 2 with ethyl isocyanoacetate in the presence of DBU. The β-nitrosulfone acts as a nitroalkene equivalent in the Barton–Zard pyrrole synthesis, and the reaction proceeds via elimination of sulfinic acid, addition of ethyl isocyanoacetate, cyclization and elimination of nitrous acid to give the desired pyrrole 3. Then compound 3 was converted into the corresponding porphyrin 4 in 20–30% yield by reduction with LiAlH4 at 0 °C, followed by subsequent tetramerization and oxidation with chloranil. A year later, porphyrin 4 was used to obtain TBP 5 after the thermal retro-Diels–Alder extrusion of ethylene by heating at 200 °C.26,27
This was the first example of the retro-Diels–Alder methodology applied in the construction of a TBP, and afterwards a lot of effort was made to functionalize these compounds with different meso-substituents (Scheme 1). This approach has inspired a large number of publications.26–29,31,37 For example, Lim and co-workers published an approach to porphyrin type 4a in order to produce benzoporphyrin derivatives (Scheme 2).38
 Scheme 2  A synthetic approach to a TBP precursor. 
In 2001 Ono and co-workers showed that the same strategy could be used for the preparation of TBPs with eight ester groups 15a–b from pyrrole 13b (Scheme 3).28,39 Dimethyl bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene-1,2-dicarboxylate (10) was prepared by the Diels–Alder reaction of cyclohexadiene (1) with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD), and converted into sulphide 11a by reaction with PhSCl. Oxidation of 11a with m-CPBA followed by treatment with DBU gave the α,β-unsaturated sulfone 12. Pyrrole 13b was prepared in good yield by treatment of 12 with tert-butyl isocyanoacetate in the presence of t-BuOK, followed by reaction of 13a with TFA at room temperature. The overall yield was 72% from DMAD after six steps. Tetramerization of 13b with aldehydes in the presence of TFA, followed by oxidation with DDQ and metallation gave the porphyrins 14a–b (32–35%), which were converted into TBPs 15a–b in quantitative yields by heating at 200 °C under low pressure for 10 min.28
 Scheme 3  Synthesis of TBPs with eight ester groups by the retro-Diels–Alder approach. 
Three years later, Ono et al. also demonstrated the versatility of this methodology to construct thia-, dithia- and oxathia-TBPs 18a–c as the first examples of core-modified TBPs (Scheme 4).30 The authors adopted the approach of reacting a tripyrrane analogue with a central thiophene ring 19a, which was prepared by the acid-catalyzed condensation of α,α′-bis(hydroxymethyl)thiophene 16d with pyrrole 3. Hydrolysis of the ester groups with lithium hydroxide afforded dicarboxylic acid 19b in 98% yield. Condensation of 19b with 16a–c in the presence of TFA in CH2Cl2 followed by oxidation with DDQ gave the macrocycles 17a–c as mixtures of diastereomers in 42, 37 and 23% yields, respectively. Porphyrins 17a–c were converted into the corresponding TBPs 18a–c quantitatively by heating at 230 °C (Scheme 4). Recently, cruciform porphyrin pentamers fused with benzene units 20a–c (Fig. 3) were also constructed using a similar approach.40
 Scheme 4  Synthesis of thia-, dithia- and oxathia-TBPs by the retro-Diels–Alder method. 
 Fig. 3  Cruciform porphyrin pentamers fused with benzene units. 
Uno et al. have developed a methodology to halogenate the retro-Diels–Alder precursor 4a and convert it into the corresponding chlorinated TBP 22 (Scheme 5). N-Chlorosuccinimide (NCS) was found to be suitable as a chlorinating reagent, and the tetrachlorinated TBP 22 could be obtained in 70% overall yield, after the retro-Diels–Alder reaction.41 Ono's research group has determined an obvious evolution on TBP synthesis.26–31 Nevertheless, problems related with price, availability, hazardous compounds such as β-sulfonylnitroethylene and versatility of the building blocks should be optimized.
 Scheme 5  Methodology to halogenate the retro-Diels–Alder precursor 4a. 
Several alternatives have been proposed to the retro-Diels–Alder method, such as the oxidative aromatization approach42 essentially developed by Vinogradov and co-workers.32–34,43 The main advantages of this methodology are simplicity and generality. The procedure allows the introduction of substituents into both benzo- and meso-phenyl rings while employing only inexpensive and readily available components. The methodology was published in 2001 and describes the synthesis of the tetrahydroisoindole 27 by two independent conversions of inexpensive sulfolene (23) (Scheme 6). Compound 28 was further transformed by the Lindsey condensation, giving tetracyclohexanoporphyrins 29a–e, which were finally aromatized (14a, 30b–d).43 These TBPs with eight ester groups were the first to be reported by Vinogradov et al., and the non-substituted derivatives can also be synthesized by this method (Scheme 7).44
 Scheme 6  Synthesis of TBPs with eight ester groups by the oxidative aromatization method. 
 Scheme 7  Synthesis of TBPs following the oxidative aromatization method. 
It is important to mention that a similar approach to synthesize non-substituted TBPs was previously developed by Cavaleiro and co-workers.45 However, the low-solubility of the TBPs discouraged subsequent studies. Moreover, the method also inspired the synthesis of the related dipyrromethanes and subsequent condensation to obtain meso-disubstituted TBPs 40, by two separate routes (Scheme 8).46
 Scheme 8  Synthesis of meso-disubstituted TBPs. 
Nonetheless, retro-Diels–Alder and oxidative aromatization methods still suffer from an important drawback, which are the harsh conditions required for the aromatization step. Heating at over 200 °C to promote the ethylene extrusion, and further prolonged heating of the hexadecahydro-TBP precursors with DDQ, resulted in loss of valuable target porphyrins at the final stage of the synthesis.
Cheprakov et al. have proposed the synthesis and use of 4,7-dihydroisoindole (50) to overcome this problem (Scheme 9).47 This synthesis is straightforward and employs tosylacetylene (47) as a powerful dienophile and is readily obtained by a previously published procedure from commercial bis-(trimethylsilyl)acetylene (45).48 Tosylacetylene (47) was then treated with a large excess of butadiene to obtain adduct 48 which was subsequently used for the preparation of 4,7-dihydroisoindole 50 by standard Barton–Zard chemistry.
 Scheme 9  Synthesis of TBPs from 4,7-dihydroisoindole. 
The porphyrin derivatives 51a–b obtained from 50 were further used for the preparation of TBPs 5b and 37, which were formed in very good yields compared to those obtained with the same benzaldehydes and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoindole. The aromatization step was effected with DDQ in refluxing toluene, and is no longer a bottleneck in the synthesis.47
Furthermore, Filatov and Cheprakov reported, for the first time, the synthesis of a TBP 56 with π-donor substituents in the annelated rings starting from the 4,7-dihydroisoindole 49 (Scheme 10). Dihydroisoindole 49 served as a starting material for the construction of diacetoxy-pyrrole 54 and then the classic oxidative aromatization procedure was pursued. Dehydrogenation occurred with the elimination of four equivalents of acetic acid to give a mixture of isomeric tetra-acetoxy TBPs 56.49
 Scheme 10  Synthesis of TBPs with π-donor substituents in the annelated rings. 
Recently, Wang et al. gave an important contribution to the progress of TBP chemistry, where the β-octabromoporphyrin 57 reacts with 4-vinyl pyridine in a three-step cascade reaction involving an eight-fold Heck reaction, six-π electrocyclizations, and subsequent aromatizations, resulting in the corresponding TBP 58 (Scheme 11).50
 Scheme 11  Synthesis of TBPs with eight pyridyl groups using the Heck reaction methodology. 
The demand for alternative TBPs with withdrawing groups led Chen and co-workers to develop a strategy for the synthesis of the novel fluorinated TBPs 61 from the β-octabromoporphyrin 59 (Scheme 12).51 The methodology was based on perfluoroalkylation, radical cyclization, and reductive defluorinative aromatization by highly selective C–F bond activation. However the authors report serious degradation of the obtained porphyrins.
 Scheme 12  Synthesis of fluorinated TBPs from a β-octabromoporphyrin. 
Uno et al. also developed a method to synthesize fluorinated TBPs, recreating the use of isoindole 63 to obtain this type of compound (Scheme 13).52 More recently, the focus has been on the establishment of functionalization procedures for TBP core structures. Beletskaya et al. developed a method based on Buchwald–Hartwig amination of meso-4-bromophenyl-TBP 67 to obtain the previously unknown amino-substituted π-extended TBPs 68 (Scheme 14).53

Bischoff and Senge studied SNAr reactions of TBP systems at the meso-positions with n-BuLi and n-C6H13Li, and the method is promising for the preparation of 5,10-substituted TBPs. However, the authors mentioned that further studies are required.54 Shaposhnikov and co-workers also reported a method for the synthesis of 5,15-diamino TBPs 72 that involved the condensation of phthalimides 69 and 70, and subsequent deprotection with the formation of TBP 72 (Scheme 15).55 The use of phthalimides as precursors in the synthesis of TBPs was a subject of some concern, as the method requires very high temperatures (e.g. 350 °C) which limits the type of substituents.56–62

3. Main applications in chemistry, catalysis, medical diagnostics, photodynamic therapy and materials science
Porphyrin derivatives are widely recognized for their use in medical applications such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) and tumour photodiagnosis. PDT involves the occurrence of chemical reactions activated by light of a visible wavelength that is used to selectively destroy target cells or tissues. The reaction requires a photosensitizer in the target tissue, a light source and oxygen. Therefore, with the development of new and effective synthetic methodologies to obtain different TBPs, these compounds are being studied as a potential alternative to common porphyrins for PDT uses. Due to the extension of their π-conjugated systems, TBPs display high chemical stability, red-shifted absorption bands, increased basicity and decreased oxidation potentials compared with the parent porphyrins. This different behaviour could involve different properties in terms of biological activity.63–65
Vicente et al. reported the synthesis of a water-soluble nido-carboranyl-TBP (76) (Scheme 16), by the oxidative aromatization method, with 43% overall yield. In comparison with a structurally related carboranyl porphyrin, this TBP showed a significantly higher uptake in human glioblastoma T98G cells in vitro, probably as a result of its higher hydrophobic character due to the four β,β′-porphyrin fused benzene rings.63 Sol et al. also reported a series of new conjugated tetraglucosyl-TBPs and tetrapolyamine–TBPs, and the preliminary viability tests in vitro on two human cancer lines (MCF-7 and HaCaT) in the presence of a polychromatic light source showed a pronounced photocytotoxicity activity.
 Scheme 16  Synthesis of nido-carboranyl-TBP. 
A different and important biological application for TBPs is their use as O2-sensors.66 Ecological questions can be studied making use of O2-sensors. Borisov and co-workers described the synthesis of a fluorinated TBP and subsequent immobilization into magnetized microparticles. This sensor was distributed across the surface tissue of a coral, and lifetime imaging was used to resolve the spatial–temporal dynamics of O2 over the tissue surface.67,68
Quantification of dissolved O2 can be of major clinical interest for the evaluation of complications from diabetes, peripheral vascular diseases, cerebrovascular and cardio-vascular events, and eye pathology, as well as the detection of tumours. The main strategy to build O2 sensor molecules is to encapsulate Pd (or Pt) TBPs inside dendrimers, since dendrimers surrounding luminescent chromophores have been shown to increase diffusion barriers for oxygen in solution.69–73 Since the main purpose of O2-sensors involves biological applications, the potential probe phototoxicity is a subject of major concern. Vinogradov et al. reported the synthesis of polyethyleneglycol-coated Pd(II) TBP-based dendritic nanoprobes (Fig. 4) and found these phosphorescent probes were non-phototoxic in a standard cell-survival assay. The data revealed that, as long as light doses are less than or equal to those commonly employed in PDT, TBP dendritic probes could be safely used for tissue oxygen measurements.71,72

It is important to note that the possibility of using TBP dendrimers as colorimetric and/or luminescent pH sensors was also explored. In fact dendritic cages are effective in modulating TBP protonation constants (pKa), since peripheral charges on dendrimers stabilize TBP internal dications. Furthermore, the peripheral charges on the dendrimers ensure complete membrane non-permeability.74
TBPs are also being studied for their properties as liquid crystals (Fig. 5), since the liquid crystalline state offers possibilities for the assembly of molecules into organized structures exhibiting novel bulk properties. In fact, at the present time, liquid crystals are extensively used in all types of display applications. Nevertheless their distinctive electro-optic properties also make them appropriate materials for non-display purposes.75–77 Qi and Liu synthesized and studied several liquid crystal TBPs (Fig. 5). The authors demonstrated the application and usefulness of cyclic voltammetry, luminescence and surface photovoltage spectroscopies in the analysis of hexagonal TBP liquid crystals. The photovoltaic properties and the charge-transfer process of the liquid crystalline state reveal that all the TBPs were p-type semiconductors.
 Fig. 5  Liquid crystal TBPs. 
The development of organic semiconductors has gained particular interest from researchers, since they can now be used as active elements in optoelectronic devices (e.g. organic light-emitting diodes), organic solar cells, organic field-effect transistors, electrochemical transistors, and recently in biosensing applications. Organic semiconductors have many advantages, such as easy fabrication, mechanical flexibility, and low cost. Organic semiconductors differ from their inorganic counterparts in many ways, such as easy shaping and manufacturing, infinite variety and tunable properties by changing the chemical structure.78 TBPs have been shown to possess excellent performance for transistor applications as well as durability. The performance is strongly dependent on the fabrication process of TBP films due to the solid state structure.79–82
Aramaki and Sakai reported that porphyrin 4a gives a good quality amorphous film by coating from solution. The authors demonstrated that precursor 4a can be converted into the corresponding TBP film even in the solid state, by heating, resulting in a good semiconductor.81 Furthermore, changing the central metal on the macrocyclic system causes a dramatic change in charge-transport properties and, in fact, constitutes an important way to model the conductivity properties of the material.79,80
The application of π-extended porphyrins, with absorption in the red region of the spectrum,83–86 is generally useful for medical applications and semi-conductor research, but also includes the conception of optical limiters87–90 and other nonlinear optical materials.91,92 Optical limiting devices have therefore become an important area of study, because of rapid advancements in high-power laser technology, which resulted in an increased necessity to protect sensors and human eyes from the damaging effects of high-energy lasers. The concept of optical limiting is related to the properties of optical nonlinear materials which are transparent under normal conditions, but become opaque when exposed to a high flux of optical radiation. Optical limiting power requires a large ratio of absorption cross section between ground and excited states, and a rather longer lived excited state compared to the pulse duration. Organic molecules with π electron delocalization, in particular tetrapyrrolic macrocyles (including TBPs), are considered potential materials for this application due to their large and fast nonlinear optical response and capability to be easily engineered for a particular purpose.87–92
Several authors have studied the correlation between meso-substitution of TBPs and their optical properties. The excited-state absorption was found to be the dominant factor for TBPs nonlinear properties, and it was established that the selection of the proper substituent on the TBPs could increase the absorption cross section ratio, which also increases the optical limiting power.87,89
The construction of sensitizers for photovoltaic (PV) cells is, in addition, a subject of major interest. Organic PV devices acquired considerable interest in the scientific community due to the simple and inexpensive techniques needed for processing the photoactive layer. A typical solar PV cell requires at least three major components: a light-absorber (a dye), a hole-transport agent, and an electron-transport agent. Occasionally one component can be used in multiple functions, as in many organic solar cells where, for example, the light-absorbing dyes also act as charge-transport agents. Thus some reports have considered and evaluated the use of TBPs in this type of application. Organic PV cells using TBPs as donor material, and fullerene as an acceptor could be obtained thermally, and the insoluble character of TBPs enables the fabrication of TBP–fullerene PV cells as a solution process. These solution-processed devices have attained power conversion efficiencies as high as 5%, and the performance of TBP-based PV cells could be improved by introducing different fullerenes.93–98
To finish, a range of authors have established99–102 some structure–property relationships depending on the specific field of application, but there are no simple rules for a specific response to each kind of use.
4. Conclusion and perspectives
Benzoporphyrin derivatives have an enormous potential for application in natural and applied sciences. In fact, there is a tendency for studies and applications in PDT since these compounds provide adequate photophysical properties for this therapeutic method. Nevertheless, some problems related with the propensity for self-aggregation in solution should be studied and overcome. As highly conjugated compounds, TBPs present strong π-stacking interactions. This property of self-organization in the solid state or in solution is remarkable for use in materials and electronic science. For example, there are many possibilities for studies in polymer science to evaluate these compounds in terms of their ability to store and conduct energy. As observed in graphene chemistry, many properties will be discovered in the future, since these compounds are under intense study and present a high level of π-conjugation. It is important to mention that TBP derivatives have occupied a prominent place in heterocyclic chemistry, and it is believed that their potential to act as organic-metal catalysts or photocatalysts is practically unexplored.
From the synthetic point of view, several important advances have been made in the last thirty years. Initially, the synthesis of TBPs was conducted using the condensation of isoindole precursors. Nonetheless, questions related with precursor reactivity and the use of melting temperatures (350–400 °C) led to the abandonment of the method. Ono and co-workers reported a practical alternative to the previous methodology, that involved the formation of porphyrins with fused bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene units, followed by quantitative elimination of ethylene (>200 °C), affording high yields of pure TBPs. The major disadvantages of this chemistry relate to the expensive nature of the precursors, and the high temperatures which may not be compatible with several functional groups. On the other hand, an alternative route was developed by Finikova and co-workers, where tetrahydro-isoindoles were cyclotetramerized to give hexadecahydro-tetrabenzoporphyrins. Dehydrogenation then afforded the fully conjugated systems. Improved yields can be obtained when dihydro-isoindoles are used instead of tetrahydro-isoindoles, since the last step of dehydrogenation occurs more easily in porphyrins produced from the first intermediate. These methodologies overcome the drawbacks associated with the dehydrogenation of the bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene units. The development of newer methodologies, such as cycloadditions with sulfones and benzoquinones, and a one-pot Heck approach using octabromoporphyrins, allowed the construction of TBPs with significantly different substituents in the benzene ring and, in some cases, the reduction of the overall number of steps. Despite that, the obtaining of TBPs in fewer and more efficient steps continues to be an important issue to be solved. Perhaps multicomponent or flow chemistry approaches could provide TBPs in good yields and “single” steps in the future, opening up new possibilities for this chemistry, and encouraging more sophisticated studies and applications.

Carla Marisa Brito Carvalho
	Carla Marisa Brito Carvalho received her BSc degree (2005) from the Department of Chemistry, University of Aveiro, Portugal. In 2007, she received her MSc degree under the direction of Professor José Cavaleiro, and in 2008 she started her PhD under the supervision of Professors Maria da Graça Neves and Augusto Tomé, also from the Department of Chemistry, University of Aveiro. Since 2012 she has been working with Professor Kleber Thiago de Oliveira as a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Federal University of São Carlos, São Paulo, Brazil. Her research interests are the chemistry and applications of tetrapyrrolic macrocycles.

Timothy John Brocksom
	Prof. Timothy John Brocksom finished his PhD in 1968 at Liverpool University, under the guidance of Prof. Sir A. R. Battersby. He then moved to Stanford University for a post-doctoral position with Prof. W. S. Johnson, and in 1970 on to the University of British Columbia for a second post-doctoral with Prof. J. P. Kutney. In 1972 he moved to the University of São Paulo as visiting Prof. and finally he moved in 1977 to the Federal University in São Carlos as full Professor. His actual research interests encompass methodologies and syntheses towards sesquiterpenes and diterpenes, with particular emphasis on the Diels–Alder reaction, and transition metal catalyzed reactions of poly-olefinic substituted cycloheptanoids.

Kleber Thiago de Oliveira
	Prof. Kleber Thiago de Oliveira was awarded his PhD in Organic Chemistry in 2006 from the University of São Paulo in Brazil, under the direction of Prof. Mauricio Constantino. He then carried out two post-doctorals, first with Prof. Cavaleiro at the University of Aveiro, and then with Prof. Iamamoto at the University of São Paulo. In 2009 he became a professor at the Federal University of ABC (Brazil), and then in 2010 moved to the Federal University of São Carlos (Brazil), integrating the group of Bioorganic Chemistry. His research group is totally focused on the design and synthesis of new heterocyclic photosensitizers.
