, Accepted 17th March 2015First published on 17th March 2015AbstractIn this study, a hybrid nanostructure comprising ZnO nanorods embedded in polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was developed for use as an antireflection (AR) coating. The fabrication process includes the etching of PMMA as an alternative to conventional photolithographic methods. This approach enables rapid, large-scale production at low cost with minimal pollution. The PMMA serves to protect the ZnO nanorods against external damage, while the O2 plasma treatment provides a modified surface profile to reduce reflectance. X-ray diffractometer (XRD) measurements and TEM results confirm that the resulting crystal structures are pure ZnO with good crystallinity. This paper compares three hybrid nanostructures (flat film, columnar, and conical) as antireflective layers. The application of poly-Si solar cells with the proposed AR layer was shown to improve cell efficiency by enhancing short-circuit current density.
Introduction
Surface antireflective (AR) coatings are widely used to improve the performance of optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells, planar displays, and light sensors. Such coatings on the surface of an optoelectronic device are meant to reduce the reflection of light and thereby increase light transmission.1–3 Subwavelength structures (SWS) are micro- or nano-structures with dimensions smaller than the wavelength of incident light. SWSs with a deep, tapered morphology are able to supress the reflection of incident light over a wide spectral bandwidth. Many types of SWS have been proposed for solar cells, such as subwavelength gratings,4–6 self-assembled nanoparticles,7,8 porous silicon,9,10 and silicon nanowire arrays.11
ZnO nanorod arrays are a type of SWS with good optical properties, ideally suited to use as AR layers on solar cells.12,13 Chen et al. reported a notable improvement in the efficiency of the devices after the application of ZnO nanorod arrays as an antireflective layer on poly-Si solar cells.14 ZnO nanostructures such as one-dimensional (1-D) nanowires, nanorods, and nanobelts have also been applied to light-emitting diodes,15–17 bistable memory,18 and nanogenerators.19 However, ZnO is susceptible to harsh environments, which can undermine their practical applicability.
To protect ZnO nanorod arrays from the damage caused by acidic and alkaline environments, this study proposes a hybrid conical structure in which a ZnO nanorod array is embedded within a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) nanostructure. Zhu et al. reported a significant improvement in broadband absorption across the entire visible and near-infrared solar spectrum through the application of an AR layer of nanocones.20 This study employed O2 plasma treatment to produce a hybrid structure with conical surface formations with the aim of improving the performance of solar cells.
Yu et al. reported that CdS/ZnO nanorod arrays can reduce reflectance to an even greater degree than ZnO nanorod arrays, when applied as antireflective coatings to facilitate light trapping in c-Si solar.21 Few previous reports have discussed the effects of material gradient index on efforts to reduce reflectance. This study attempted to match the refractive index of PMMA (1.43) with that of ZnO (2.0).22
This study developed a simple, low cost process for the production of antireflective surfaces, in which a ZnO nanorod array is embedded within a PMMA layer on the surface of solar cells. This process involves the etching of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), as an alternative to conventional photolithographic methods. We also investigated the effectiveness of three hybrid nanostructures with distinct shapes (flat film, columnar, and conical), which were produced simply by varying the etching time.
Experiment
Sample preparation
ZnO nanorods were synthesized using a two-step process that began with the formation of a ZnO seed layer followed by a chemical bath.23 A ZnO film was first deposited by radio-frequency (RF) sputtering deposition on a p-Si (100) substrate and poly-Si solar cells (Motech Industries, Inc.) to form a crystal seed layer. Sputtering was conducted under Ar gas with deposition pressure of 10 mTorr, Ar flow rate of 12 sccm, and RF power of 30 W. Following deposition of the ZnO seed layer, ZnO nanorods were formed in an aqueous solution of zinc acetate dehydrate (0.025 M) and hexamethylenetetramine (0.025 M) at 80 °C for 3 h. The products were then rinsed using deionized water, air-dried, and annealed at 300 °C in air for 1 h. PMMA solution dissolved in toluene at a concentration of 4 wt% was subsequently dropped onto the ZnO nanorods and spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 60 s. The spin-coated ZnO nanorods covered with PMMA were then thoroughly dried on a hot template at 100 °C for 20 min. We then used O2 plasma treatment to remove a portion of the PMMA covering, with the aim of producing a surface coating of conical structures. Specifically, O2 plasma treatment (50 W) was applied at a pressure of 10 mTorr to dry-etch the residual PMMA with the aim of exposing the tips of the ZnO nanorods. A flow chart illustrating the fabrication process is presented in Fig. 1.

Characterization
The crystal orientation of the ZnO nanostructures was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku RINT 2100) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2010). Observation of the surface morphology and cross-section views of the samples were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Hitachi S4100). Reflectivity was measured using an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3310) in a wavelength range of 400–800 nm. The solar cells were characterized under AM1.5G illumination.
Results and discussion
Fig. 2 presents X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns typical of an as-grown ZnO nanorod array. Three peaks corresponding to (100), (002), and (101) were identified. A strong (002) preferential orientation was also observed. The inset in Fig. 2 present a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the fabricated ZnO nanorod array. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns reveal clear phases, indicative of crystal of high quality with single crystalline fibrils derived from ZnO nanorods along the [001] direction. This TEM image reveals that the ZnO nanorod array grown on the seed layer is preferentially oriented along the c-axis.

The height and roughness of the surface of the nanorod array produces strong light scattering and improves light absorption by reducing reflectance and extending the duration in which the light remains in the solar cell.
High ZnO nanostructures for surface roughness
We began by estimating the etching rate of O2 plasma treatment through the observation of a Si wafer spin-coated with PMMA. The thickness of the PMMA (as determined from a cross-section SEM image) decreased linearly with etching time from 0 to 150 s. Fig. 3 presents the thickness of the PMMA as a function of etching time. The nearly linear etching rate within the timeframe employed in this study made it possible to predict the results as calculated from a slope of approximately 1.22 nm s−1.

Fig. 4(a) presents top-view and cross-section SEM images of as-grown ZnO nanorods. The ZnO nanorods were preferentially vertical to the substrate with a diameter of approximately 100–200 nm and a length of 1 μm. The SEM images are consistent with the XRD patterns. This resulted in ZnO nanorod structures with dimensions shorter than the wavelength of visible light.

Fig. 4(b) presents top-view and cross-section SEM images of the PMMA-coated nanorods. The top-view image reveals a smooth surface across the ZnO nanorods due to even coverage of the PMMA, which entirely concealed the ZnO nanorods. The cross-section SEM image in Fig. 4(b) clearly shows that the free space between individual ZnO nanorods was entirely filled with PMMA, which insulated the nanorods from contact with air. Ultimately, the role of the PMMA was to protect the ZnO nanorods against damage from the external environment.
The smooth surface caused by the PMMA was modified to a roughened state in order to expose the tips of the nanorods. Fig. 4(c)–(f) respectively present SEM images of the ZnO nanorod/PMMA structure after 60, 90, 120, and 240 seconds of O2 plasma etching. When the duration of O2 plasma treatment was increased from 60 to 90 s, the PMMA layer became thinner, such that the tops of the nanorods became visible (Fig. 4(e)); however, the gaps between individual ZnO nanorods remained entirely filled with PMMA. ZnO is a semiconductor and PMMA is an insulator, such that the large difference in conductivity between the two significantly affected the contrast of the SEM images. The ZnO nanorods appear bright white and the PMMA appears dark black, which makes them easy to differentiate.
A further increase in the duration of O2 plasma treatment to 240 s (Fig. 4(f)) resulted in a slight change in the surface morphology and length of the as-grown nanorods; however, the effects were largely unnoticeable. This can be attributed to the fact that the rate at which the ZnO nanorods were etched by the O2 plasma treatment was far lower than that of the PMMA. As a result, this method provides excellent selectivity in dry etching, wherein the tops of the nanorods are exposed but the rest of the rods remain protected from further plasma damage.
Measurement of optical properties
As shown in Fig. 5(a), it was found that adding a ZnO seed layer to the bare Si wafer reduced the average reflectance from 35.7% to 23.8%, which was further reduced to 10.47% when a ZnO nanorod array was grown over this layer. Reflectance with the seed layer can be effectively reduced through the addition of intermediate index layers, which break the air-silicon index discontinuity into smaller and smaller steps.3 The refractive indices of ZnO and PMMA are approximately 2.00 and 1.43, respectively, both of which are between those of Si (3.94) and air (1.00). Thus, the refractive indices increase progressively from air to the Si substrate, the result of which is similar to a multilayer AR coating.24 Furthermore, the refractive index of ZnO nanorods gradually alters the incident light axis and leaves a rougher, less reflective surface, which explains why the reflectivity of ZnO nanorod arrays is lower than that of a bare Si wafer.25

(b) Top-view SEM image of ZnO nanorod/PMMA structure following O2 plasma treatment for 120 s. The inset shows a magnified image and (c) a schematic illustration. All scale bars are 500 nm. 
Fig. 5(a-1,2) also presents a comparative spectral reflectivity plot of ZnO nanorod arrays and ZnO nanorod/PMMA structures grown on single-crystalline Si wafers and then etched for various durations (0 to 120 s). Following O2 plasma treatment over a period of 0–120 s, the average reflectivity of the ZnO nanorod/PMMA structure decreased with an increase in etching time. The average reflectivity after 120 s was slightly lower (9.93%) than that of the as-deposited ZnO nanorod array (10.47%). The porosity of the nanorod array varied gradually from the top (air/nanorod interface) to the bottom (nanorod/seed layer interface). The porosity gradient created a graded-refractive-index layer along the incident light axis.3,11,26 Shin et al. reported that a difference in refractive index at the air/nanorod interface reduces reflectivity and is influenced by the surface profile of the nanostructures.27 The conical shape at the end of the nanorods creates a porosity gradient and lowers the initial value of the refractive index (adjacent to the air), thereby reducing the difference between the refractive indices.
Fig. 5(b) presents a top-view SEM image of the ZnO nanorod/PMMA structure following O2 plasma treatment for 120 s. As can be seen, the tips of the nanorods emerged from the PMMA with sufficient roughness to reduce reflectance. The inset in Fig. 5(b) presents a higher magnification image showing the morphology of ZnO nanorod/PMMA structure after O2 plasma treatment for 120 s. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the exposed ends of the PMMA-wrapped nanorods formed conical shapes, which may explain the low reflectivity of this structure. Fig. 6 presents top-view SEM images of poly-Si solar cells with ZnO nanorods grown on the surface. The nanorods, which preferentially grew on the boundaries of poly-Si grains, appear as a white dust. The grain boundary is like a well with a high aspect ratio and is therefore difficult to fill with conformal step coverage by sputtering. The thickness of the seed film on the side wall was not uniform (thick on top and thin at the bottom) and an overhang formed at the top corners of trenches along the grain boundaries.28 Therefore, Yang et al. reported that vertical ZnO nanowire arrays on arbitrary substrates using solution method can be better step coverage.29 Song et al. reported that the morphology of ZnO nanorods is largely influenced by the thickness of the seed layer,30 such that a thicker seed layer leads to the formation of longer nanorods, as shown in the inset of Fig. 6(b). The other hand, the vertical ZnO nanorods depend on the crystals of ZnO seed prefer a {0001} orientation by post-anneal.29

Fig. 7 compares the current–voltage characteristics (measured under AM1.5G illumination) of a bare poly-Si solar cell with those produced using ZnO nanorod arrays, ZnO nanorods with PMMA coating, and O2-plasma-etched ZnO nanorods with PMMA coating, respectively. The short-circuit current densities (Jsc) of the three solar cells with AR coatings exceeded those of the bare poly-Si solar, due to a reduction in reflectivity. The short-circuit current of the device with O2-plasma-etched ZnO nanorod/PMMA coating is 6% higher than that of the device with ZnO nanorod arrays. The light conversion efficiencies of the three cells are as follows: bare poly-Si solar cell (10.23%), ZnO nanorod array (10.85%), ZnO nanorod/PMMA coating (11.2%), and O2-plasma-etched ZnO nanorod/PMMA coating (11.57%). The trend in efficiency is consistent with the trend in reflectivity.

Conclusions
Our findings demonstrate that ZnO nanorod/PMMA coatings may be suitable as AR layers for electro-optical applications. ZnO nanorods were coated with PMMA polymer to provide protection from the air and O2 plasma treatment was used to modify the surface profile of the AR layer. The application of O2 plasma treatment to the ZnO nanorod/PMMA structure for 120 s was sufficient to form nanorods with a shape capable of reducing reflectivity while remaining well protected from harsh environmental effects. All of the AR coatings in this study reduced the surface reflectivity of incident light, which led to a notable improvement in light-harvesting efficiency. The ZnO nanorod/PMMA structure that underwent O2 plasma treatment for 120 s presented the highest efficiency of 11.57%.
