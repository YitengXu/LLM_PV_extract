TiO2/CdS nanoparticles and Pt nanoparticle-decorated reduced graphene oxide sheets (rGO/Pt) were synthesized separately and characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical experiments. Hydrocarbon samples were collected and analysed using gas chromatography (GC). After 5 hours of illumination under visible light, 0.11 μmol of CH4 was produced at an average production rate of 0.0867 μmol h−1, which is higher than the production of CH4 measured from the TiO2/CdS and the TiO2/CdS/Pt control samples. The photoelectrochemical experiments confirmed that the presence of rGO sheets in the nanocomposite enhanced the electrochemical and photocatalytic properties of the nanocomposite as a result of rapid electron transport and the inhibition of charge recombination.
1. Introduction
Considerable attention has been devoted to the consequences resulting from the greenhouse effect, which arises from the increasing concentrations of CO2 and other harmful gases in the atmosphere.1 One strategy to minimize this effect is to capture these gases from the atmosphere and convert them into more economically attractive substances. Therefore, capturing and converting carbon dioxide into hydrocarbons has attracted considerable attention in both the scientific community and in industry.2,3 Several studies on the reduction of CO2 to methanol (CH3OH), formaldehyde (HCOOH), and methane (CH4)4–17 have been reported. Among the hydrocarbons produced from carbon dioxide, methane is one of the products with economic appeal as a fuel because of its high energy density (55.7 kJ g−1).8
Different strategies have been proposed for converting carbon dioxide into hydrocarbons, such as thermochemical,9 electrochemical10,11 and photoelectrochemical methods.12 Among the methods applied for this purpose, the photoreduction of CO2 using water and sunlight is a promising and elegant strategy because it uses the sun as the energy source in a process that is similar to photosynthesis in plants. In general, this process can be performed using suitable semiconductors that are able to absorb visible radiation.13 When a semiconductor is illuminated with energy greater than or equal to its band gap, electrons (e−) are promoted from its valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB).13,14 Once within the conduction band, electrons can reduce carbon dioxide to hydrocarbons in the presence of H+ ions. The positive charges (holes – h+) remaining in the valence band can oxidize water molecules to oxygen gas, thereby generating protons (H+).
TiO2 is typically employed as the semiconductor of choice in studies of photocatalysis because of its relatively low cost, excellent stability over a broad pH range, corrosion resistance and strong oxidizing power.15 Nevertheless, its wide band gap allows for the absorption of ultraviolet light, which is a drawback for the application of TiO2 in photocatalysis using sunlight as the illumination source. This drawback can be circumvented by doping TiO2 with anions or cations, by sensitizing with dyes or by combining with another semiconductor with a narrow band gap that is able to absorb radiation within the visible range.16,17 Cadmium sulfide (CdS) has been widely used in conjunction with TiO2 in photocatalytic systems due to its strong absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum.18,19 The use of TiO2/CdS composites provides optical and catalytic properties that differ from those of the individual constituent materials. Depending on the nanoparticle size, CdS provides broad visible light absorption, proper thermal stability and resistance to photodegradation when coated with a protecting layer.20,21
One of the primary drawbacks in photocatalysis is the poor conversion efficiency provided by these systems, which is on average 2.5% (quantum efficiency) under visible light.22 The efficiency values found for these photocatalytic systems are primarily associated with the fast dynamic charge recombination of photogenerated charges (electron–hole).23,24 It is largely accepted that the photogenerated electrons in the semiconductor (without any bias voltage from an external source) are conducted through the material by diffusion among the nanoparticles.25,26 The process of electrons diffusing in the semiconductor is not efficient because of surface defects, which result in an increase in charge recombination processes (e− with h+), thereby decreasing the photocatalytic efficiency.24 An interesting approach to decrease this effect is to improve electron transport in the system by introducing conducting carbonaceous materials. Xia et al.27 reported that TiO2 electrodes containing dispersed carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are more efficient in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 than analogous TiO2 electrodes without the presence of the carbonaceous material.27,28 More recently, many researchers have reported increases in the photocatalytic activity of several semiconductors by preparing composites with MWCNTs or graphene-based materials.29–31 This photocatalytic approach is more efficient than the use of small amounts of metal nanoparticles known as co-catalysts deposited onto the semiconductor surface or onto the surface of carbonaceous materials.32 Metal nanoparticles commonly used as co-catalysts are Ni, Ti, Co, Rh, Ir and Pt.33 Pt-based composites are interesting because of their unique properties, and these composites are used in several applications in magnetic, catalytic, and biomedical areas.34 These nanocomposites are currently considered to be the most effective catalysts for hydrogen evolution35 and for CO2 reduction,36 primarily because of their stability, chemical inertness and high catalytic activity.
Hence, this work presents, for the first time, the use of the quaternary nanocomposite TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt as a catalyst for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane using water and visible light as the only energy sources. Samples of TiO2/CdS and rGO/Pt were prepared separately and then mixed to obtain TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite films. Each individual component and the quaternary nanocomposite were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, electron transmission microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity of the TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt system for the conversion of CO2 to methane was investigated for five hours using a homemade photoreactor.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of TiO2/CdS nanoparticles
The procedure used for the preparation of TiO2/CdS nanoparticles was similar to that described by Li et al.37 First, 1.5 g of the polymer Pluronic® F-127 (BASF) was dissolved in 19 mL of ethanol containing 0.14 g of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O. Titanium tetrachloride (0.015 mol) was then added to this solution, which was vigorously stirred for 1 h. The resulting solution was deposited onto a Petri dish, and the system was maintained at 40 °C for 4 days under ambient conditions for solvent evaporation. The material was heated at 400 °C for 4 h (EDG3P – S model, EDG) to produce TiO2/CdO powder. Then, 0.3 g of TiO2/CdO powder was dispersed in 50 mL of an aqueous solution containing Na2S (0.2 mol L−1) at room temperature. After 6 h of continuous stirring, the resulting product was obtained by filtering, washed three times with distilled water and then dried. The semiconductor samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction using a Shimadzu-XDR 7000 diffractometer equipped with a copper tube and a graphite monochromator and operated at a power of 40 kV and 35 mA. Scanning electron microscopy images were acquired using a FEI Inspect F50 – high-resolution SEM operated at a voltage of 5 to 10 kV and current of 12 μA. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy images were acquired using a HRTEM-JEM 3010 URP microscope. Raman spectra were recorded using a Raman confocal spectrometer, model T64000 – Jobin Yvon – USA, with an exposure time of 30 s, accumulation of 10 spectra and laser excitation of 514.5 nm in the frequency range of 200–800 cm−1.
2.2. Synthesis of platinum nanoparticles on graphene oxide
The deposition of Pt nanoparticles onto graphene oxide sheets was performed following the procedure described by Xing et al.38 This procedure consists of depositing Pt nanoparticles over the material of choice by adding a precursor, K2PtCl4. The procedure begins by depositing 15 mL of an aqueous solution containing ethylene glycol (2:1 ethylene glycol:water, volume ratio) to an aqueous solution of graphene oxide prepared following the procedure reported by Gorchinskiy et al.39 The resulting solution was then transferred to a volumetric flask. Then, 10 μl of K2PtCl4 that was previously dissolved in water at a concentration of 0.01 mol L−1 was deposited. To deposit Pt nanoparticles over graphene oxide sheets, the system was refluxed for 2 h using a thermostatic silicone oil bath (125 °C). Following this step, Pt nanoparticles were deposited onto the graphene oxide sheets at a concentration of 1% by weight (with respect to rGO). Pt/graphene oxide samples were separated from the ethylene glycol solution using distilled water (washing steps) and centrifugation for three times. To complete the reduction of graphene oxide, small amounts (drops) of hydrazine hydrate were added to this solution under stirring to provide reduced graphene oxide (rGO) decorated with Pt nanoparticles.40 The same procedure was used for depositing Pt nanoparticles over TiO2/CdS to obtain the TiO2/CdS/Pt nanocomposite. The samples were characterized using XRD, SEM and HR-TEM.
2.3. Preparation of quaternary nanocomposite TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt
Nanocomposites were prepared by dispersing 1% by weight of rGO/Pt and TiO2/CdS into an isopropanol/water solution (2:1). The system was kept in an ultrasonic bath for 30 minutes to completely disperse the components in the solvent mixture. Afterwards, the suspension of the quaternary nanocomposite was deposited by the doctor blading technique onto an FTO substrate (active area of 2 cm2) and then dried in an oven to evaporate the solvent to obtain TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt (film thickness: 6 μm). For comparison, TiO2, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CdS/Pt films were prepared using the same procedure described above for the preparation of the TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite. The nanocomposites were characterized using SEM and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy with a Varian Cary 5G UV-VIS spectrometer (NIR) equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory.
2.4. Photocatalytic reduction of CO2
The photoreactor was constructed by taking into account some features described in the literature.41 It was equipped with rubber septa for collecting gaseous samples, inlet and outlet gas valves, a pressure gauge and a quartz window for sunlight illumination. The quaternary and other nanocomposites, as well as the individual samples, were deposited onto a glass substrate and then introduced inside the reactor. The system was sealed by a metal lid and nitrile rubber, specifically designed for this task. Dynamic vacuum was applied to the reactor for 30 minutes to remove air. Then, 0.5 mL of liquid water and CO2 (99.9% purity) were injected into the reactor until a pressure of 0.2 bar was reached. The reactor was subsequently continuously illuminated by polychromatic light (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) for 5 h using a solar simulator (Solsim). During the illumination, the gaseous samples that formed inside the reactor were collected each hour, injected into an HP5890 series II gas chromatograph, and quantified.
2.5. Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical experiments were conducted using an Autolab® PGSTAT10 potentiostat/galvanostat (Eco Chemie) controlled by GPES software, which was used for acquiring and analysing the data. A conventional three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell, consisting of the FTO/TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt, FTO/TiO2/CdS/Pt, FTO/TiO2/CdS and FTO/TiO2 films as working electrodes (active area of 1 cm2); Ag/AgCl in a KCl solution (3.0 mol L−1) as the reference electrode; and platinum wire as the counter electrode, was used in the experiments. An aqueous solution of Na2SO3 (1.0 mol L−1) was used as the supporting electrolyte and sacrificial reagent (hole scavenger) to avoid degradation of the CdS nanoparticles.42–44 The photoelectrochemical cell was placed in an optical bench consisting of an OrielXe (Hg) 250 W lamp coupled to an AM 1.5 filter (Oriel), collimating lenses and a water filter (Oriel). The light intensity was calibrated using an optical power metre, model 1830 C (Newport) to 100 mW cm−2, but no correction was made to account for reflection and transmission losses. We used the same films in the PEC studies, with the exception of those decorated with Pt nanoparticles.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CdS/Pt nanoparticles
Fig. 1 presents powder XRD patterns of the pristine TiO2, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CdS/Pt samples.
 Fig. 1  Powder XRD patterns of the TiO2, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CdS/Pt samples. 
Anatase and rutile are the crystalline phases in the pristine TiO2 sample according to the XRD pattern shown in Fig. 1. This mixture of crystalline phases has previously been reported for TiO2 samples synthesized using other methods.45–47 The peaks at 2θ values of 25.3°, 37.9° and 48.2° can be indexed to the (101), (004) and (200) planes of anatase titania, and the peaks at 2θ values of 27.5°, 36.2°, 41.3° and 44.1° can be indexed to the (110), (101), (111) and (210) planes of rutile titania, respectively. The powder XRD pattern of TiO2/CdS shows broad and intense signals within the ranges of 24–30°, 35–40° and 45–50.47,48 These diffraction signals correspond to the crystalline planes of CdS nanoparticles, which overlapped with the diffraction peaks of anatase TiO2. The broadening of the basal peak at 25° and increase in intensity of the peak at 44° indicate the presence of the CdS nanoparticles, which were also observed by other techniques, as discussed in the next section. Another important observation is that the characteristic XRD signals from the rutile phase observed in the XRD pattern of the pristine TiO2 sample essentially disappear in the TiO2/CdS sample. This result is likely a consequence of the synthesis of CdS nanoparticles in conjunction with TiO2, which primarily contributes to the formation of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. The anatase crystalline phase has provided better results when applied in dye-sensitized solar cells and in other photocatalytic systems than the rutile phase.49–51 As shown in Fig. 1, it is not possible to observe the X-ray diffraction signals from platinum nanoparticles in the TiO2/CdS/Pt systems because of the amount of platinum nanoparticles is below the detection limit of the instrument. Additional information regarding the composition of the nanocomposites was obtained by Raman spectroscopy and high-resolution microscopy (HR-TEM).
Fig. 2(a) presents the Raman spectrum of the TiO2/CdS sample measured under a laser excitation of 514.5 nm (Elaser = 2.41 eV), and Fig. 2(b) shows the HR-TEM image of the TiO2/CdS sample deposited on a copper grid. The secondary electron (SE) images of TiO2/CdS nanocomposite show that the two nanoparticles coexist in an aggregated form and this morphology was also confirmed by High Angle Annular Dark Field (HAADF) Images (Fig. S1†).

An intense resonance effect is expected for the CdS crystalline phase because the band gap of the CdS nanoparticles is 2.4 eV, which is similar to the laser excitation used to characterize the semiconductor samples in this work. This effect is indeed observed, as shown in Fig. 2(a), because an intense signal was registered at 300 cm−1 and corresponds to the first-order longitudinal optical phonon (1 LO).52 The second-order LO is less intense, and it was registered at 600 cm−1, in good agreement with results reported elsewhere for samples containing CdS.53–55 The presence of titanium dioxide nanoparticles was also confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 2(a), by the presence of vibrational modes at 395, 516 and 637 cm−1. These signals correspond to the anatase crystalline phase of titanium dioxide.52 Note that the characteristic Raman signals from the rutile phase were not identified because they should appear within the range of 420 to 450 cm−1.52 This result is consistent with the data obtained from the powder XRD patterns, in which no diffraction peaks associated with the rutile phase could be identified in the TiO2/CdS samples. Fig. 2(b) shows the HR-TEM image of this sample, where it is possible to observe the presence of CdS and TiO2 particles. The (101) plane of TiO2 and the (112) plane of CdS were also identified. Note that in this image, the sample is composed of nanosized spherical particles and oblate spheroids for both TiO2 and CdS. The morphology observed in this work was also reported by other authors for a system composed of TiO2/CdS.56
3.2. Characterization of reduced graphene oxide decorated with platinum (rGO/Pt)
Fig. 3 presents powder XRD patterns of the graphene oxide samples reduced by hydrazine and of the reduced graphene oxide decorated with Pt nanoparticles. Note that the process for depositing Pt nanoparticles over the carbonaceous material also reduces the graphene oxide sheets, giving rise to a rGO/Pt nanocomposite, a conductive material. Fig. 3 also shows the thin-film XRD pattern of a Pt film on a conducting glass substrate for comparison.
 Fig. 3  Thin-film XRD pattern of a platinum film over a conducting glass substrate (Pt), powder XRD patterns of hydrazine-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and reduced graphene oxide decorated with Pt nanoparticles (rGO/Pt). 
As observed in Fig. 3, graphene oxide samples reduced by hydrate hydrazine (rGO) show a broad signal with maximum intensity at 24.2°, which corresponds to an interplanar distance of d(002) = 0.37 nm, providing evidence for the loss of some oxygen-containing functional groups.57 A similar signal profile is also observed in the graphene oxide samples decorated with Pt nanoparticles (rGO/Pt), except for the appearance of two new intense signals at 39° and 46°, which correspond to the crystalline planes of Pt with (111) and (200) orientations, respectively.57 These two signals may be visualized in Fig. 3 for the platinum film over a conducting glass substrate (Pt), thus confirming the existence of crystalline platinum. Other diffraction peaks correspond to the crystalline phases of the FTO (Fluorine-doped tin oxide) conductive substrate, and these peaks are marked with asterisks. Xing et al.38 also observed similar XRD patterns for carbon nanotubes decorated with Pt nanoparticles. The SEM images in Fig. 4(a) indicate that Pt nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed over the sheets of carbonaceous material. Pt nanoparticles supported on graphene images were also observed by HAADF detector. Both aggregated and isolated Pt nanoparticles were found and the average size is around 3–4 nm (Fig. 2S and 3S†). It is interesting to observe that Pt nanoparticles were found in both sides of the graphene sheets as revealed by the HAADF images and their corresponding SE images.

The HR-TEM image in Fig. 4(b) shows that the Pt nanoparticles that decorate the rGO sheets have different nanoparticle morphologies and minimum aggregation. This low degree of aggregation among Pt nanoparticles provides evidence for an intense interaction between rGO sheets and the nanoparticles. Moreover, sheets from this material have a high surface area, allowing Pt nanoparticles to deposit onto both sides of the sheets, which might favour the photocatalytic processes.58,59 Fig. 4(c) shows the particle size distribution for Pt nanoparticles determined from HR-TEM images. The Pt nanoparticles have a broad size distribution, as shown in the histogram of Fig. 4(c), with an average particle size of 3.44 nm ± 1.26. This broad particle size distribution for Pt nanoparticles is associated with the employed synthesis method, and it has already been reported elsewhere.38
3.3. Characterization of TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite
The surface morphology of the TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite was investigated by SEM images as shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  SEM image of the TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite. 
As shown in Fig. 5, TiO2/CdS nanoparticles were deposited over the rGO/Pt sheets, which have a wrinkle-paper-like surface. The TiO2/CdS and Pt nanoparticles have a large dispersion over the entire rGO sheet, and this feature can positively contribute to the photocatalytic processes. The secondary electron (SE) and the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) images of the TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite also confirmed that both Pt and TiO2/CdS nanoparticles are supported on the reduced graphene oxide layer. In addition, the Pt and the TiO2/CdS nanoparticles are in both (upper and bottom) sides of graphene sheets (Fig. 4S†).
In order to obtain a more detailed morphology of the nanocomposite, EDS analysis was carried out in the TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite (Fig. 6). The mapping of the elements confirms the presence of all components distributed over the graphene sheets in an intimate contact which is important for the success of the photocatalytic reaction as depicted in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 6  EDS analyses of TiO2/CdS/Pt nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide (rGO): (a) HHADF image, (b) titanium map, (c) oxygen map, (d) sulfur map, (e) cadmium map and (f) platinum map. 
The absorption spectra of the TiO2, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt samples were measured using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Diffuse reflectance spectra of the TiO2 (1), TiO2/CdS (2) and TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt (3) nanocomposites. 
The absorption of the TiO2 nanoparticles is limited to the UV region, whereas the TiO2/CdS sample presents a broad band from 200 to 600 nm, which is characteristic of the titania nanoparticles and of the first excitonic peak of the CdS nanoparticles.60 Compared to the TiO2/CdS sample, the increase in optical absorption above 400 nm for the TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite is a result of both reduced graphene oxide absorption and light scattering.
3.4. Analysis of hydrocarbon production and photoelectrochemical measurements
The TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite was analysed as a photocatalyst for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane in the presence of only water and solar irradiation. Fig. 8 shows the results of methane production as a function of reaction time (5 h) for the quaternary nanocomposite photocatalyst and for the TiO2, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CdS/Pt samples.
 Fig. 8  Amount of methane produced by the photocatalysis reaction in the presence of water and carbon dioxide for different samples: TiO2, TiO2/CdS, TiO2/CdS/Pt and TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt. Reaction parameters: 50 mg of photocatalyst, CO2 pressure inside the reactor equal to 0.2 bar, 0.5 mL of water, and illumination (100 mW cm−2) for 5 h. 
As shown in Fig. 8, the pristine TiO2 sample exhibits limited photocatalytic activity, giving rise to only 0.04 μmol of methane. This effect is likely a consequence of the band gap of TiO2 (3.2 eV), with maximum absorption in the UV range, thus limiting methane production in the visible range. Wang et al.61 achieved 0.07 μmol of methane from a TiO2 (Degussa P25) sample using a similar experimental procedure to that reported herein. Fig. 8 also shows the production of CH4 for the TiO2/CdS sample, indicating a slight increase in the production of methane compared to pristine TiO2 due to the CdS absorption in the visible range (see UV-vis spectra in Fig. 7). When the TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite containing graphene sheets decorated with Pt nanoparticles was employed, the production of methane significantly increased, even compared to Pt-coated TiO2/CdS samples. This effect results from the beneficial synergy between all four components in the photogeneration, charge separation and transport of the charge carriers.
The mechanism involved in the production of methane from CO2 and water is complex and begins upon photoexcitation of the two semiconductors. First, it is interesting to consider the energy level diagram of all components in the TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite. The relative energetic positions of the conduction band (CB), valence band (VB) and work function (ϕ) for TiO2, CdS, RGO and Pt are shown in Fig. 9(a). A schematic illustration of the photoinduced charge separation and transfer process in the TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite is also presented in Fig. 9(b).
As shown in Fig. 9(a), the energies of the TiO2 CB and VB are −4.32 and −7.52 eV, respectively, whereas those for the CdS on TiO2 are −4.14 and −6.48 eV,62 respectively. In addition, the ϕ of rGO and Pt are approximately −4.9 eV and −6.3 eV, respectively.63,64 In this diagram, the CB edge of CdS is above that of TiO2. When the TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite is exposed to visible light, excited electron–hole pairs are generated in both semiconductors. Due to the specific nature of the band alignment at the TiO2/CdS interface, the photogenerated electrons are transferred to the CB of TiO2, whereas the holes remain in the VB of CdS.65–67 The spatial separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs in different semiconductors reduces charge recombination and is important for photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical devices.68,69 The rGO sheets are a well-known electron-accepting material with excellent conductivity properties as a result of its two-dimensional planar structure. Thus, a faster electron transfer from both TiO2 and CdS nanomaterials to the rGO sheets (via the titania conduction band) is expected to occur. The rapid transport of the charge carriers in the graphene sheets promotes an even better charge separation. This process eventually decreases the rate of recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs.

In addition, the high surface area provided by the carbonaceous material favoured a homogeneous distribution of the Pt nanoparticles and a strong physical contact between the TiO2 and CdS nanoparticles. In this respect, the Pt nanoparticle co-catalyst also efficiently contributes to conduct electrons towards carbon dioxide molecules, thereby reducing them to methane. Fig. 9(b) schematically illustrates how the proposed photoinduced charge separation and transfer process occurs in the TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite.
According to Inoue et al.,70 the conversion of CO2 to methane involves a multistep reduction process given by: 
H2O(l) + 2h+ → 1/2O2(g) + 2H(aq)+
(1) 
CO2(aq) + 2H(aq)+ + 2e− → HCOOH
(2) 
HCOOH + 2H(aq)+ + 2e− → HCHO + H2O(l)
(3) 
HCHO + 2H(aq)+ + 2e− → CH3OH
(4) 
CH3OH + 2H(aq)+ +2e− → CH4 + H2O(l)
(5)where e− and h+ denote photogenerated electrons and holes, respectively. First, the presence of h+ promotes water splitting, resulting in the formation of oxygen gas (O2) and H+ ions. These H+ ions, when combined with CO2 molecules and electrons, promote the formation of organic molecules (hydrocarbons), which at the end of the process are converted to methane by adding more protons and electrons.71
In summary, the photocatalytic results indicate that the TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite exhibited better performance towards CO2 photoreduction than the TiO2, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CdS/Pt nanocomposites. This conclusion is also supported by the photoelectrochemical measurements performed using the TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt quaternary nanocomposite and using the TiO2, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CdS/Pt films deposited onto FTO substrates (Fig. 10). The substrates were employed as working electrodes in a typical three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell.
As observed in the chronoamperometry measurements (Fig. 10), the photocurrents responded immediately to the presence of light when the cell operation was interrupted every minute for 50 s (on/off cycle). All samples exhibited anodic photocurrent, indicating that the electron flux is towards the electrode and then driven to the platinum wire by the external circuit. The films prepared with TiO2 nanoparticles showed only a small photoactivity, i.e., a low photocurrent due to its limited band gap in the ultraviolet region.72 For the TiO2/CdS film, appreciable values of photocurrent appeared immediately under illumination (ON) and decreased to nearly zero in dark conditions (light OFF). This effect is due to a strong absorption of CdS nanoparticles in the visible region, followed by a fast electron transfer to the TiO2 nanoparticles.62,63 An enhancement in the anodic photocurrent values was observed for the TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite compared to TiO2/CdS/Pt and TiO2/CdS. In fact, platinum nanoparticles contribute to the increase in the photocatalytic activity of the systems, as previously reported.73,74 The higher anodic current for the TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite is consistent with the photocatalysis data as a higher amount of methane gas was detected when the TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite was employed, suggesting that the quaternary nanocomposite is an efficient material for photocatalysis. It is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of each component separately. We strongly believe that electrons are transported more efficiently through the rGO sheets, thereby decreasing the recombination between electrons in the TiO2 CB and the holes in the CdS VB. In addition, the presence of Pt nanoparticles is important for more efficiently catalyzing the CO2 reduction reaction. Coupling two semiconductors (TiO2 and CdS) with complementary absorption profiles and suitable energy levels, which allowed an efficient electron transfer between them, was also a key factor for the success of this quaternary nanocomposite.

4. Conclusions
TiO2/CdS and rGO/Pt nanocomposites were synthesized separately and then mixed to obtain a new TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite with interesting properties for application in photocatalysis. The XRD data indicated that anatase was the main crystalline phase in pristine TiO2, likely due to the simultaneous synthesis of CdS in conjunction with TiO2. According to the SEM and HR-TEM images, Pt nanoparticles deposited over rGO sheets are homogeneously dispersed over the entire sheet of carbonaceous material. The TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite was investigated as a photocatalyst for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane in the presence of only water and visible light. The TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite provided higher photocatalytic activity than TiO2, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CdS/Pt samples. This result suggests that the transport of photogenerated charges occurs in the carbonaceous material, which is favoured by the relatively high rGO surface area, by the efficient contact among TiO2/CdS nanoparticles and by the presence of Pt nanoparticles, which are able to efficiently transport electrons towards carbon dioxide molecules. The enhanced electron transport in the graphene films of TiO2/CdS/rGO/Pt nanocomposite was also evidenced in the photoelectrochemical measurements.
