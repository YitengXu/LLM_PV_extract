    , Accepted 10th January 2022First published on 30th January 2022AbstractMolecular engineering for non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with advanced power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), particularly from the aspects of theoretical analysis, has been a hot topic in the community of bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs) in recent years. In this context, taking NFAs Y6, Y10 and Y11 as research objects, the influence of molecular engineering of the terminal group (A) and the electron-deficient core (A′) group on the performance of NFAs and donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces was theoretically explored by using density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) and Marcus charge transfer theory. It was found that the introduction of fluorine into the terminal group and benzotriazole (BTZ) into the electron-deficient core group improved the molecular polarity index (MPI), the electrostatic potential (ESP), the optical absorption properties, the first excited-state lifetime (τ), the hole and electron delocalization index (HDI, EDI), the electron transfer rate (Ke) and the electron mobility (μe) of the investigated NFAs, and reduced the charge recombination rate (KCR) and enhanced the charge separation rate (KCS) of the investigated D/A interfaces, thus leading to a higher PCE. More importantly, the designed J11/Y6, J11/Y11 and PM6/Y10 interfaces have superior KCS/KCR values to the experimental interfaces. Our investigation provides a theoretical guideline for a molecular design strategy of advanced OSC devices.
1. Introduction
With the depleting fossil resources and continuous environmental pollution, clean and renewable energy has attracted considerable attention around the world.1–6 Solar energy is one of the most reliable resources that could meet the gigantic and sustainable demands for energy around the world.7,8 Solar cells have exhibited tremendous potential in effectively utilizing solar energy.9,10 Since Heeger et al.11 first proposed the bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs) in 1995, BHJ OSCs have been gaining popularity in the field of solar cells due to their light weight, mechanical flexibility, transparency, and low risk of pollution.12–17 The BHJ active layer composed of an electron donor and acceptor plays a dominant role in the performance of the OSC devices.18,19
Although fullerene derivative acceptors (FAs), acting as the electron acceptors, have strong isotropic electron transport abilities,20,21 the inherent defects including the weak absorption in the visible and infrared bands, and high cost of manufacturing and purification have considerably limited their practical applications.22–24 Compared with FAs, NFAs are easier to design by modifying the core and terminal groups, which endows them with tuneable energy levels to acquire suitable energy offsets.22,23,25–27 The extraordinary performance of NFAs has received a huge amount of attention. Therefore, scientists are gradually replacing FAs with NFAs as the electron acceptor, which has led to the rapid development of NFA solar cells.28–32
Recently, Yuan et al. have developed a series of A–DA′D–A non-fullerene acceptors.33–42 Among them, a new non-fullerene acceptor named Y636 with dithienothiophen[3,2-b] pyrrolobenzothiadiazole (TPBTD) as the core group and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2FIC) as the electron-deficient terminal group was synthesized and characterized. The PCE of OSC devices based on PM6/Y6 has reached a value of 15.7%. By replacing the terminal group 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2FIC) with 2-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophene-4-ylidene)malononitrile,43 another promising NFA structure Y1039 was synthesized with an excellent PCE value of 13.46% when mixed with J11. A novel NFA named Y1140 was synthesized by using benzotriazole (BTZ) instead of the electron-withdrawing core benzothiadiazole (BTD) of Y6. The device having Y11 as the electron acceptor and PM6 as the electron donor showed a remarkable PCE value of 16.54%. The molecular structures of Y6, Y10, Y11, PM6 and J11 are presented in Fig. 1, and the diversities of the electron-withdrawing terminal groups and the fused-ring electron-deficient core groups in the molecular structures of NFAs lead to the obvious discrepancy of PCE. Therefore, it is extremely significant to explore the effects of molecular engineering on the performance of NFAs and OSCs.

Herein, the influence of the structural diversities of the electron-withdrawing terminal group and the fused-ring electron-deficient core group of NFAs on the performance of OSCs is comprehensively investigated by using density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) and Marcus charge transfer theory. In addition, the performance of PM6/Y6, J11/Y10, and PM6/Y11 interfaces is theoretically explored, and three novel interfaces J11/Y6, PM6/Y10, and J11/Y11 are constructed to investigate the potential applications in OSCs. The geometric structures and photoelectric properties of NFAs were analysed, such as frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), FMO energy levels, densities of states (DOSs), surface electrostatic potentials (ESPs), electron affinities (EAs), ionization potentials (IPs), hardness (η), electron reorganization energy (λe), absorption spectra, excited states, electron transport rates (Ke) and electron mobility (μe). In terms of six D/A interfaces, several significant parameters affecting the PCEs of OSC devices were assessed, comprising the charge difference density (CDD), the energy levels interrelated to open-circuit voltage (Voc), the absorption spectra related to light-absorbing efficiency and the charge separation and recombination rate (KCS and KCR) related to short-circuit current density (Jsc).
2. Methods
DFT44 and TD-DFT45 have been widely used to study BHJ OSC performance.46 Using the B3LYP47 hybrid density functional theory combined with the 6-31G(d,p)48 basis set, the geometric structures of Y6, Y10, Y11, PM6, J11 and their corresponding cations and anions were optimized. Considering the computational cost, the monomer is employed to build PM6, J11 and related D/A interfaces. The previous publications also show the reliability of simulation calculations using the monomer as the model of the electron donor in the organic photovoltaic heterojunction system.49–52 Frequency analysis was performed at the same theoretical level to ensure that the optimized geometry is at the minimum point on the potential energy surface without imaginary frequencies. To save computing resources and time, the alkyl chains of the two polymers, the NFAs and the D/A interfaces are methylated since the side alkyl chains of organic molecules have little significant effect on the optical and electronic properties of the molecules.53,54 The D/A interfaces are commonly used as BHJ interface models of OSC devices. In our work, the π–π stacking mode is adopted in the configuration of the D/A interfaces, which is one of the most stable configurations of D/A interfaces confirmed by previous results of theoretical studies.29,49–52,55 The geometry optimization and frequency analysis of D/A interfaces were calculated at the same theoretical level as that of the NFAs.
For the absorption spectra of the NFAs and D/A interfaces, the B3LYP functional and 6-31G(d,p) basis set were employed within the framework of TD-DFT, since it provides values close to the experimental results (Table S1, ESI†). The conductor-like polarized continuum model (C-PCM) method56 was taken into account to simulate the solvent environment (chloroform). In order to sufficiently characterize the excited state charge transfer (CT) characteristics of A–DA′D–A type non-fullerene NFAs, a hole–electron analysis was implemented in Multiwfn 3.8.57 The charge density differences (CDDs) of the D/A interfaces were calculated by Multiwfn 3.8 to characterize the excited states.
The Marcus charge transfer theory56 is used to calculate the electron transfer rate (Ke) and mobility (μe) of the donor and acceptor, and charge separation and recombination rate (KCS and KCR) at the D/A interfaces. The charge transfer integral (VDA) of the D/A interfaces is calculated by the finite field method and the generalized Mulliken–Hush (GMH) model.58 The DFT/PW91PW91/6-31G(d,p) method56 is used to explore the transfer integral (te) of the NFAs. In addition to the package mentioned above, other calculations in this work were performed using the Gaussian 16 package.43
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Donors and acceptors

3.1.1. Ground state structures and electronic properties. 
The active layer composed of the electronic donor and acceptor is a chief part of the OSC devices. As shown in Table S2 and Fig. S1 (ESI†), the bond lengths of NFAs are identically similar. Meanwhile, the NFAs have prominent planarity with dihedral angles close to 0°. The good planarity brings about high electron mobility in NFAs.59
The electronic structure is critical for the photoelectric properties of NFAs, which could further influence the efficiency. The frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of the NFAs associated with the main transition configurations are presented in Fig. 2a and Fig. S3 (ESI†). The FMO distributions of the NFAs are nearly identical. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and LUMO+1 of Y6, Y10 and Y11 are delocalized throughout the whole backbone, and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), HOMO−1, HOMO−2, and HOMO−3 are mostly localized on the DA′D moieties, whereas LUMO+3 and LUMO+2 are mainly contributed by the A moieties. Combining the results of Fig. 2a, Fig. S3 (ESI†) and Table 3, it is seen that most of the excitation of Y6, Y10 and Y11 in the visible region exhibits an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character, which facilitates the reduction of the Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes, and thus promotes the dissociation of excitons.50

The energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO are important parameters that markedly affect the electronic properties, carrier transport properties and optical absorption. The LUMO level of the acceptor was lower than that of the donor, and the HOMO level of the donor was higher than that of the acceptor, which revealed that the six D/A interfaces can overcome the Coulomb attraction and make the excitons dissociate successfully. Compared with Y10, Y6 has low-lying HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which is ascribed to the introduction of fluorine with strong electron-withdrawing ability due to its strong electro-negativity.60,61 Compared with Y11, Y6 has low-lying HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which might be due to the large hyperpolarizability of sulphur atoms. Moreover, BTD has low-lying HOMO and LUMO energy levels compared with BTZ (Table S3, ESI†), indicating that the electron accepting strength of BTD is stronger than that of BTZ. The driving force of exciton separation at D/A interfaces is mainly provided by the difference between the LUMO levels of the donor and acceptor, named the electron barrier.62 In terms of NFAs, the lower the LUMO level, the larger the electron barrier. The results indicated that the electrons of the polymers are more easily transferred to the LUMO levels of Y6 and Y11, while the polymers/Y6 and polymers/Y11 interfaces are more prone to exciton separation compared with polymers/Y10. The partial density of states (DOS) was used to supply quantitative information to analyse what each part of the molecule contributes to the HOMO and LUMO. As shown in Fig. 2b, the NFAs can be divided into three parts: TPBTD, FIC, and alkyl for Y6, TPBTD, TC, and alkyl for Y10 and TPBTZ, FIC, and alkyl for Y11. The HOMOs and LUMOs of NFAs are chiefly contributed by DA′D cores and terminal groups, respectively. The densities on the HOMO and HOMO−1 are fully localized on electron-donating fragments. The densities of LUMO and LUMO+1 are almost localized on electron-deficient fragments. Through comparison, it can be seen from Fig. 2b that the FIC unit may contribute to reducing the HOMO and LUMO compared with the TC unit since Y6 has lower FMOs than Y11. Notably, the DOS distributions of Y6 and Y11 are more uniform than that of Y10.
Molecular surface electrostatic potentials (ESPs) manifest the three-dimensional charge distributions of NFAs, which visualizes variable charged regions, and deficient and rich electron positions of all investigated NFAs. As listed in Fig. 3a and b, the surface ESP (isosurface = 0.001 a.u.) distributions and further quantitative information on Y6, Y10 and Y11 are given. The surface ESP distributions of Y6, Y10 and Y11 gradually alter from red to blue, indicating that the surface ESP changes from negative to positive owing to the electron-withdrawing terminal groups. Analyzing the molecular surface areas at different electrostatic potential intervals helps in understanding the quantitative distribution of the molecular surface electrostatic potentials. As shown in Fig. 3a, the surface ESP area distributions of Y11 in different electrostatic potential intervals are relatively uniform. For the NFAs, the ESP distribution trend of the atoms is consistent. The negative electrostatic potential in neutral systems usually appears near the lone pair electrons and π-electron clouds of highly electronegative atoms.63 For the central acceptor units (atoms 0–15), the minimum ESP appears in the imine nitrogen atoms of BTD and BTZ (atoms 7 and 8 of NFAs), while the maximum ESP appears in the nitrogen atoms of pyrrole (atoms 12 and 13 of Y6 and Y10, atoms 11 and 12 of Y11). The lone pair electrons of the imine nitrogen atoms of BTD and BTZ participate in the hybridization to form three sp2 hybrid orbitals, which leads to the enrichment of electrons in the region near the imine nitrogen atom, thus resulting in a minimum ESP. The sp3-N lone pair electrons of the nitrogen atoms in pyrrole participate in the π-conjugation of the carbon skeleton and lose a significant magnitude of the lone pair character, leading to the maximum ESP.63 As listed in Table 1, the quantitative information of surface ESP distributions on Y6, Y10 and Y11 is extracted. The polarity of the molecules is closely related to the charge distribution, while the molecular polarity index (MPI) of NFAs is estimated by Formula S1. The MPI of Y11 is smaller than that of Y6 and Y10, which displays that the charge distribution on the surface of Y11 is more even. According to previous research,64–66 the difference of surface ESPs between the donor and acceptor is positively interrelated to the intermolecular electric field (IEF). At the same time, the strengthening of IEF might be instrumental in the exciton dissociation and charge transport. The overall average ESPs of Y6 and Y11 are larger than that of Y10, which is conducive to forming stronger IEF at the D/A interface, leading to faster exciton dissociation and charge transport.

3.1.2. Open circuit voltage (Voc). 
Open circuit voltage (Voc) is a critical element influencing the performance of organic solar photovoltaic cells.67 The Voc of D/A interfaces can be estimated theoretically by the following equation:68 (1)where e is the elementary charge, and EHOMO(D) and ELUMO(A) are the HOMO of the donors and the LUMO of the acceptors, respectively. ΔV = 0.3 V, the empirical constant for NFAs molecules.69 The Voc values of OSC devices with experimentally synthesized and designed D/A interfaces are listed in Table S4 (ESI†). The experimental and the theoretical Voc values range from 0.83 V to 0.89 V, and 0.75 V to 0.81 V, correspondingly. Since PM6 has lower HOMO levels than J11, PM6 based OSC devices have higher Voc than J11 based OSC devices when the NFA is the same.


3.1.3. Electron affinities, ionization potentials, hardness, and reorganization energy. 
Electron affinities (EAs) can be used to estimate the difficulty of hole–electron binding, while the ionization potentials (IPs) can be used to measure the difficulty of molecular ionization, which also represents the electron and hole barriers in the electron transport of the OSCs.70,71 The IPs and EAs of the molecules are estimated by formulae (S3) and (S4) (ESI†). Generally, for NFA acceptors, lower IPs can facilitate the separation of excitons, while higher EAs result in easier electron injection.72–75 Compared with Y10, Y6 has higher EAs, while Y11 has lower IPs (Table 2). Therefore, the polymers/Y6 and polymers/Y11 interfaces might have better efficiency of electron injection and exciton separation, respectively. The hardness (η) can evaluate the ICT capability, while lower η brings about lower ICT resistance. The results indicated that Y11 has a lower ICT resistance compared with Y6 and Y10. In addition, electron reorganization energy (λe) is a crucial parameter in NFAs, which can evaluate their electron transport characteristics. In general, the lower λe represents superior mobility and intramolecular electron transfer performance.71 The value of λe manifests that Y11 has high electron transfer rate and electron mobility.

Compared with Y6, Y11 has lower IPs, η and λe, which is attributed to the introduction of BTZ in the electron-deficient core. The nitrogen substitution with a lone pair of electrons (n–π*) of BTZ weakens the electron accepting strength of central substitution, thereby increasing the ICT transition. Therefore, the polymers/Y11 OSCs might have a higher Jsc.


3.1.4. Electronic absorption spectra. 
When the molecules of the BHJ active layer that absorb solar energy are excited, an exciton is produced. A BHJ active layer with excellent performance should have a wide and strong absorption spectrum. In Table 3, some key parameters related to the light absorption performance are provided, including the main transition configuration, transition energy (E), optical absorption peak (λabs), oscillator strength (f), and excited-state lifetimes of S1 (τ); meanwhile, the corresponding optical absorption spectra are plotted in Fig. 6a.

As shown in Fig. 6a, the absorption spectra of NFAs have two absorption peaks in the ranges of 350–550 nm and 600–1200 nm, respectively. Compared with Y6, Y11 possesses an about 10 nm red-shifted absorption spectrum, which might be due to the nitrogen substitution with a lone pair of electrons (n–π*) weakening the electron accepting strength of central substitution thereby increasing the ICT transition, resulting in a red-shifted absorption. Moreover, the BTD with strong electron accepting ability weakens the ICT of Y6, resulting in a blue-shifted absorption. The τ of NFAs is one of the significant factors for considering the efficiency of charge transfer. The NFAs with a longer lifetime in the excited state are more prone to charge transfer. As listed in Table 3, the τ of Y6 is higher than that of Y10, implying that fluorinated NFAs have better light absorption performance than their nonfluorinated counterparts. Meanwhile, the τ of Y11 is higher than that of Y6, illustrating that introduction of BTZ in the electron-deficient core group could improve the optical properties of OSC devices.


3.1.5. Excited state analysis. 
The S0 → S1 transition of NFAs is selected to study electron excitation characteristics owing to its correspondence to the ICT and the maximum optical absorption peak.76 The electron and hole distributions of Y6, Y10 and Y11 are portrayed in Fig. 4a. The holes (blue area) are chiefly localized on the DA′D units, while the electrons (green area) are delocalized throughout the whole backbone of the NFAs. As listed in Fig. 4b, the hole and electron distributions of Y6, Y10 and Y11 are smoothed to investigate the relative positions of the hole and electron distributions. The results illustrate that the centroid distances between the holes and the electrons of Y6 and Y10 are smaller than that of Y11. Fig. 4c lists the contributions of non-hydrogen atoms to holes, electrons and their overlaps in the investigated NFAs, while the results displayed that all non-hydrogen atoms of Y6, Y10 and Y11 contribute to the distribution of holes, electrons and their overlaps.

(b) Smooth description of holes and electrons (isosurface = 0.0005 a.u.). (c) Electron–hole overlap transition density matrixes of Y6, Y10 and Y11 in the excited state (from top to bottom), the colors show the contributions of non-hydrogen atoms to holes, electrons and their overlaps. 
The efficient photoelectric conversion process of OSCs is positively related to rapid exciton separation. As listed in Table 4, the characteristic parameters of electron excitation are computed by Multiwfn to compare the exciton separation capacity of NFAs. The centroid distance between the hole and the electron (D index) can be used to measure the degree of exciton separation in the CT direction. The D indexes of the S0 → S1 transitions of the three NFAs are close to the length of a C–C bond, which is relatively small. The overlap degree of the hole and the electron (Sr index) can estimate and show the excitation characteristics of electrons through quantitative values. The larger the Sr index, the higher the overlap of holes and electrons, and the more difficulty in hole and electron separation. The Sr indexes of Y6, Y10 and Y11 are greater than 0.6 (the upper limit is 1.0), which means that the hole and electron distributions overlap. Estimated from the Sr and D indexes, the S0 → S1 values of the three NFAs are local excitations. The D indexes show that Y6 and Y11 have more efficient exciton separation in the CT direction. The Sr index of Y10 is larger than those of Y6 and Y11, indicating that Y10 possesses a larger overlap of holes and electrons and can result in harder separation of holes and electrons. The HCT index represents the average extension degree of the holes and the electrons in the charge transfer direction. Y11 has a larger HCT index than Y6 and Y10 with wider spatial extension of holes and electrons in the CT direction. In addition, the hole delocalization indexes (HDIs) and electron delocalization indexes (EDIs) of the NFAs are calculated, as shown in Table 4. The smaller the HDI (EDI) value, the higher the delocalization degree of holes (electrons), that is, the greater the uniformity of distribution. Y6 and Y11 have larger HDIs and EDIs compared with Y10, bringing about holes and electrons possessing more uneven distributions, which might be due to the charge aggregation produced by adequate exciton separation. The t index and the binding energy of excitons (Ecoul) are usually used to measure the separation degree of holes and electrons in NFAs, while a larger t index and a smaller Ecoul will make exciton separation easier for NFAs. The values of the t index and Ecoul are in the order of Y11 > Y6 > Y10 and Y11 < Y6 < Y10, respectively. The NFAs of Y11 and Y6 have a larger t index and a smaller Ecoul than the NFA of Y10, resulting in more efficient exciton separation in the CT direction, which is consistent with the analytical results above.

Compared with Y10, Y6 has a larger D index, HCT index and t index, and a smaller Sr index and HDI (EDI) value, which might be due to the introduction of the fluorine atom with stronger electron-withdrawing capability in the terminal groups of the NFAs, promoting the effective exciton separation and leading to polymers/Y6 with a higher Jsc. Furthermore, Y11 possesses a larger D index, HCT index and t index, and smaller Sr index and EDI value, which might be due to the lone pair electrons of the central nitrogen atom on BTZ with more activity than the central sulfur atom on BTD.
As listed in Fig. 5a, the orientation of the ICT effect in the excited state can be precisely analyzed by the atom–atom charge transfer matrix (CTM) method. The abscissa and ordinate represent the hole and electron position, respectively. The influence of hydrogen was neglected in transitions, owing to the hydrogen playing an inessential role in overall transitions.77 As shown in Fig. 5a, the diagonal elements of Y6, Y10 and Y11 displayed large numerical areas, certifying the large hole and electron distributions in the DA'D and terminal groups. The values of the lower right corner are smaller than those in the no-diagonal elements in the upper left corner, which illustrated that the electron transfer is chiefly from the small atomic number to the large one, meaning the electron transfer is from the DA'D groups to the terminal groups. As listed in Fig. 5b, the interfragment charge transfer (IFCT) is employed to quantify the charge transfer in electron excitation further. Y6, Y10 and Y11 are split into fragment 1 and fragment 2, which represent terminal groups and DA'D cores units, respectively. For the electron excitation process of Y6, the overall direction of charge transfer is from fragment 2 to 1 with the net transfer amount of 0.23684 electrons. The IFCT results of Y11 are similar to Y6 while the net transfer of electrons from fragment 2 to 1 is 0.24653 electrons, indicating the stronger ICT effect of Y11 than Y6. Nevertheless, compared with Y6 and Y11, the overall direction of charge transfer of Y10 is also from fragment 2 to 1 with a smaller net transfer (0.20337 electrons) due to the diversity in the core and terminal groups. Therefore, the results provide theoretical support for the charge transfer of NFAs, while indicating that Y11 and Y6 are more excellent charge transfer materials than Y10.

3.1.6. Electron mobility of NFAs in Marcus theory. 
The free electrons produced by exciton separation at D/A interfaces migrate to the NFA phase.59 The electron transport rate (Ke) and mobility (μe) are the key factors to measure the transport efficiency of electrons in the NFA phase. The acceptor with a higher Ke and μe can obtain higher electron transport efficiency, and the OSCs can also have a higher Jsc.
Marcus theory is usually used to calculate the Ke of NFAs:78 (2)where λe represents the electron reorganization energy, te is the electron transfer integral, ℏ is Planck's constant, KB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature (T = 300 K), and Ke is the electron transfer rate. The parameter of te can be given by the following equation:79,80 (3)In the formula, EL+1 and EL represent the energy levels of the LUMO+1 and LUMO for acceptors, respectively. The te is significantly influenced by the intermolecular stacking of NFAs or the pathways of electron hopping. The face-to-face π–π stacking has a principal contribution to the pronounced electron transport for organic materials as the π–π stacking has a larger orbital overlap according to reports, which is conducive to boosting the electronic coupling. Herein, when the electron transport properties of NFAs were investigated, the electron hopping pathways in the orientation of π–π stacking between the adjacent molecules were usually considered.49,51
As the acceptor materials of the active layer in the OSCs (electron transport layer), NFAs should have excellent electron transport capability. According to the Einstein equation, the μe can be calculated as:81,82 (4)where e is the electron charge, De is the electron diffusion coefficient, KB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is room temperature. The electron diffusion coefficient De can be evaluated from the hopping rates as:83,84 (5)where km is the hopping rate due to the charge carrier transfer to the mth neighbour, and rm is the distance to neighbour m, and pm is the relative probability of charge carrier transfer to a particular mth neighbour. In addition, when considering only one neighbour, the diffusion constant along a single molecular dimer is simply defined as:85 (6)where ke and r are the rate of charge mobility and intermolecular distance for the dimer, respectively. At room temperature, the mobility of hopping μe can be expressed as:86,87 (7)where r and Ke are the jumping distance between adjacent NFAs and the electron transfer rate, respectively.
The electron transport rate (Ke) is mainly determined by electron reorganization energy (λe) and electron transfer integral (te), while a smaller λe and a larger te result in a relatively large Ke. As shown in Table 5, Y11 has a relatively small λe, leading to a large Ke. The order of the te of the NFAs is Y11 > Y6 > Y10, in which Y11 has a significantly larger te, resulting in more excellent Ke. Apparently, the value of Ke is positively correlated with μe. The value of μe for Y6 is about 1.5 times that of Y10, while Y11 is about 3 times that of Y10, which implies that Y11 is the better electron transport material. The fluorinated IC of Y6 has a stronger electron-withdrawing ability than the TC of Y10 due to the strong electronegativity of the fluorine atom, promoting the intermolecular interactions through forming noncovalent F–S and F–H bonds, which is favorable for the electron transport.88 In addition, compared with Y6, Y11 has a larger μe due to the introduction of the BTZ in the core group of the NFAs, which is consistent with experimental results.34,36 The large μe increases te and free movement of intermolecular electrons, leading to a higher Jsc of polymers/Y11. Overall, Y11 has better electron transport performance in the electron transport layer of OSCs due to the introduction of fluorine in the terminal group and BTZ in the electron-deficient core group, which is beneficial to obtain higher Jsc.

3.2. Donor/acceptor interfaces

3.2.1. Absorption spectra. 
The light-absorbing ability of materials in OSCs exerts crucial influences on Jsc, and thus a rational match in photo-absorption between donor and acceptor materials is necessary for high-efficiency OSCs. Fig. 6b shows the simulated absorption spectra for six D/A interfaces. The corresponding main transition configuration, transition energy (E), optical absorption peak (λabs) and oscillator strength (f) of these six D/A interfaces are listed in Table S5 (ESI†). As can be seen, six D/A interfaces have similar absorption spectra with a wide absorption spectrum from 400 to 1200 nm. The λabs mainly corresponds to the electronic transitions from HOMO to LUMO. As shown in Table S5 (ESI†), the sequence of the strongest absorption peak (S2) is PM6/Y11 > J11/Y11 > PM6/Y6 ∼ PM6/Y10 > J11/Y10 ∼ J11/Y6. The results indicate that the investigated D/A interfaces have similar light absorption performance.

(c) The CDD plots, excitation energy E, and corresponding oscillator strengths f of CT states among S1–S5 for the investigated D/A interfaces, where the violet and turquoise colors show the increase and decrease in electron density, respectively. 


3.2.2. Charge density difference. 
To further clarify the excited state characteristics and the electron transfer process of D/A interfaces vividly and intuitively, DFT and TD-DFT are used to probe into the charge transfer characteristics under optical excitation. The charge density difference is as follows:89–91 (8)where Cμai represents the μth eigenvector of the single configuration–interaction43 Hamiltonian in the basis of the occupied Hartree–Fock molecular orbital MOφi() and the unoccupied orbitals MOφa(). The CDD represents the difference in charge distribution between the nth excited state and the ground state.92 The first and second terms of the formula represent the hole and electron, respectively.93
The CDD plots of CT states among S1–S5 for the investigated D/A interfaces are displayed in Fig. 6c for each dimer model. As we can see, some states exhibiting electron transfer from the donor to acceptor after the transition are characterized as CT states, in which holes are concentrated in the polymers, and the electrons are distributed on the NFAs, indicating that the electrons are transferred from the polymers to NFAs. The CDD plots exhibit the electron transfer processes and characteristics of each excited state and the roles of the polymers and the NFAs in each excited state. The results demonstrated that effective charge separation happened in the S1 state of all investigated D/A interfaces.


3.2.3. Charge separation/recombination rate in Marcus theory. 
After excitons are generated in the active layers, they migrate to the D/A interfaces and separate to form free electrons and hole carriers,50,94,95 while the charge separation and recombination rates (KCS and KCR) at the D/A interfaces are crucial parameters to evaluate the efficiency of exciton separation. The Marcus semi-classical model is usually used to calculate the KCS and KCR at D/A interfaces:56,96 (9)In the above formula, kB represents Boltzmann's constant, ℏ represents Planck's constant, T = 300 K, the room temperature, VDA is the charge integral rate of the electron coupling between the polymers and NFAs, λtol is the reorganization energy, which can usually be expressed as the sum of the internal and external reorganization energy of the molecule (λin and λs, respectively), and ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change during the charge separation and recombination process, which can be divided into ΔGCS during charge separation and ΔGCR during charge recombination. It can be seen from formula (7) that the KCS and KCR are mainly determined by the three main parameters VDA, λ, and ΔG. These parameters are listed in Table 6 and Tables S6–S8 (ESI†).

The difference of reorganization energy of D/A interfaces is extraordinarily small; hence, the parameters of charge transfer integral (VDA) and Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) play a decisive role in the charge separation and recombination rates (KCS and KCR). The value of VDA is proportional to KCS and KCR, specifically, the larger VDA is instrumental in the generation of larger KCS and KCR. It could be seen in Table 6 that PM6/Y11 has the highest KCS with a value of 4.399 × 1014 s−1 among the investigated D/A interfaces owing to its highest VDA. When the |ΔGCS| < λtol, the smaller ΔGCS is more conducive to effective exciton dissociation, while with the |ΔGCR| > λtol, the smaller ΔGCR is profitable in the generation of weaker charge reorganization. The ΔGCR differences of all investigated D/A interfaces are relatively small, which may be owing to the slight difference between the EIP(D) and EEA(A) values. Furthermore, the D/A interfaces formed by polymers/Y6 and polymers/Y11 have a significantly smaller ΔGCS, which might be conducive to acquiring a larger KCS. Besides, the designed novel D/A interfaces of J11/Y6 and J11/Y11 also have a smaller ΔGCS compared with the two existing D/A interfaces of PM6/Y6 and PM6/Y11, showing that the charge separation performance of the designed J11/Y6 and J11/Y11 interfaces is more outstanding than that of the experimental interfaces PM6/Y6 and PM6/Y11, which is more beneficial to the charge transfer in the BHJ active layer.
For the D/A interfaces, a larger KCS and a smaller KCR are more instrumental in obtaining higher Jsc. The results display that all the investigated D/A interfaces have extraordinarily large KCS and small KCR (KCR ≪ KCS) values, manifesting that the electron–hole pairs can be completely separated. For the experimental interfaces, the order of KCS/KCR is PM6/Y11 > PM6/Y6 > J11/Y10, indicating that the introduction of fluorine in the terminal group and the BTZ fused-ring as the electron-deficient core of NFAs can make the D/A interfaces achieve a greater KCS, which leads to more effective charge separation and hence obtaining a higher Jsc, which agrees well with the experimental results. In order for effective reproduction of the results closer to the experimental results, the three D/A interfaces were constructed by using the dimer donor and NFAs. The corresponding optimized structures are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), and the parameters of all investigated D/A interfaces are shown in Table S9 (ESI†). As shown in Table S9 (ESI†), the trend of λtol, ΔGCR, ΔGCS, and VDA of D/A interfaces constructed by the dimers was consistent with D/A interfaces constructed by monomers. Meanwhile, the order of KCS/KCR was (PM6)2/Y11 > (PM6)2/Y6 > (PM6)2/Y10, which was consistent with the results of the D/A interfaces formed by using monomer donors and NFAs. In addition, comparing the novel designed D/A interfaces with the experimental D/A interfaces, the order of KCS/KCR is J11/Y11 > PM6/Y11 > J11/Y6 > PM6/Y6 > PM6/Y10 > J11/Y10. The results reveal that the KCS/KCR values of all the designed D/A interfaces are larger than the corresponding experimental interfaces, which proves that the designed interfaces possess immense application potential in OSC devices.

4. Conclusions
We have systematically investigated the effects of molecular engineering of the terminal group (A) and the electron-deficient core (A′) on the performance of NFAs and the D/A interfaces using DFT, TD-DFT and Marcus charge transfer theory. The results indicate that the introduction of heterocycle BTZ in the electron-deficient core and the substitution of F for H atoms in the terminal groups of NFAs promotes exciton dissociation, elevates the electron transfer rate and mobility, prolongs the first excited-state lifetimes of investigated NFAs, increases the charge separation rate, and decreases the charge recombination rate of the D/A interfaces. Comprehensively, the PM6/Y11 interface possesses the highest performance among the three experimental D/A interfaces, which is consistent with the experimental results. Most notably, the designed D/A interfaces of J11/Y6, J11/Y11 and PM6/Y10 have superior performance to experimental D/A interfaces. Our work investigates the effect of molecular engineering on the performance of NFAs and OSCs and discovers three advanced performance D/A interfaces. It may provide theoretical guidance for experimentalists to discover promising NFAs in high-efficiency OSCs.
