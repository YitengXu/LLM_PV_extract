    , Accepted 24th November 2015First published on 24th November 2015AbstractTwo types of cyclopentadithiophene dyes with different linking modes with an N-annulated perylene (NP) donor were designed and synthesized. These new dyes were applied in Co(II)/(III) based dye-sensitized solar cells and an efficiency up to 7.8% could be obtained for peri-NP linked CPD-1. The effect of the linking mode on the material properties and device performance was discussed.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted extensive attention because of their high efficiencies, simple fabrication, and low production costs.1 Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving their power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs). To date, a PCE greater than 12% has been achieved using porphyrin-based dyes2 and the efficiency has been further improved to 13% with the introduction of the benzothiadiazole (BT) unit at the acceptor moiety.3 One of the key strategies to achieve highly efficient DSCs is to develop appropriate push–pull type dyes with appropriate energy level alignment and strong light harvesting capability. Among the various push–pull dipolar structures, arylamine based dyes are the ones that have been extensively studied.4 Arylamine derivatives are well-known electron-rich compounds and possess many favourable properties such as redox, ion transfer processes, photoelectrochemical behaviour as well as excellent electronic properties,5 which make them desirable organic sensitizers.
Our group is particularly interested in perylene and its derivatives due to their excellent photophysical properties, charge transport properties, as well as outstanding chemical, thermal, and photochemical stability.6 They have been successfully incorporated in both organic photovoltaics7 and DSCs.8 In particular, N-annulated perylene (NP),9 in which the nitrogen atom is annulated at the bay region (Fig. 1), has emerged as a superior building block. The electron-rich nature of NP makes it an ideal electron donor that can be further functionalized.10 Our group first reported that porphyrin dyes with NP as an electron donor could give more than 10% power conversion efficiency in Co(II)/(III) based DSCs.11 We also demonstrated that NP can be used as an efficient spacer for the design of push–pull type sensitizers.12 At the same time, P. Wang13 and Z. Wang's14 groups also employed the same NP as building blocks for DSCs, and impressively, a PCE over 12% can be achieved.13e To date, most chemistry on NP based dyes has been mainly focused on peri-positions, while the modifications in the bay-region have rarely been reported. Hence, it is essential to design NP-based molecules with two different modes, i.e., peri- and bay N-linkages (Fig. 1), and study their effects on material properties and device performance.
 Fig. 1  NP functionalized cyclopentadithiophene dyes CPD-1 to CPD-4 with different linking modes. 
In this work, four NP-functionalized cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) dyes CPD-1–CPD-4 were designed and used in DSCs (Fig. 1). The molecular design is based on the following considerations: (1) NP is electron-rich and thus can serve as an electron donor like aryl amines; (2) compared with normal aryl amines, NP shows strong absorption in the visible range (λmaxabs = 413 nm) with a high extinction coefficient, which will be good for light harvesting; (3) CPDT was selected as a π-spacer for its rigid structure and facile introduction of alkyl chains;15 (4) cyanoacetic acid was chosen as an electron-acceptor/anchoring group because it has been proved to be efficient for many metal free sensitizers;16 (5) as compared to CPD-1 and CPD-2, the NP unit in CPD-3 and CPD-4 is linked to CPDT through the bay amino-site instead of the commonly studied peri-position. These two different linking modes will provide a good comparison and allow us to investigate their effects on the electronic structure of the dyes and consequently the device performance; (6) for CPD-2 and CPD-4, an electron-deficient BT moiety was inserted between the NP and CPDT unit to generate a D–A–π–A structure, which is believed to facilitate intramolecular charge separation and to tailor the light-harvesting properties.17
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route of NP functionalized CPDT dyes CPD-1 to CPD-4. Reaction conditions: (a) (i) Pd(PPh3)4, aq. K2CO3, toluene; (ii) cyanoacetic acid, piperidine, CHCl3; (b) (i) NBS, DMF, 0 °C; (ii) Pd(PPh3)4, aq. K2CO3, MeOH, toluene, 4-tert-butyl phenyl boronic acid; (c) Cu, 18-crown-6-ether; 1,4-dibromobenzene; (d) (i) n-BuLi, THF; (ii) n-Bu3SnCl. 
The synthetic route towards NP functionalized CPDT dyes CPD-1–CPD-4 is shown in Scheme 1. Suzuki coupling of NP boronic ester 110b with monobromo-CPDT 212 followed by Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid afforded CPD-1 in 55% yield. CPD-2 was synthesized through similar two-step reactions in 23% yield, except that the first step would be a one-pot three-component Suzuki coupling reaction of monobromo-NP 310b with BT diboronic ester 4 and monobromo-CPDT 2. The synthesis of CPD-3 and CPD-4 commenced with the preparation of key intermediates 7a and 7b. The parent NP 5 was treated with NBS followed by Suzuki coupling to afford 6 in 68% yield. The Ullmann reaction of 6 with 1,4-dibromobenzene gives 7a, which was subsequently converted into 7b. CPD-3 was prepared by Stille coupling of 7b with monobromo-CPDT 2, followed by Knoevenagel condensation. Similar to CPD-2, CPD-4 was synthesized through a two-step procedure, firstly through a one-pot three-component coupling reaction followed by condensation with cyanoacetic acid.
The absorption spectra of CPD-1–CPD-4 in THF (Fig. 2) were measured and tabulated in Table S1 (ESI†). CPD-1 and CPD-3 exhibit strong absorption peaks at 488 nm (ε = 6.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1) and 450 nm (ε = 6.7 × 104 M−1 cm−1), respectively, which can be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer. As compared to CPD-1, the absorption peak of CPD-3 was blue shifted by about 38 nm, indicating the lower conjugation of the bay-linked NP with the CPDT moiety. When the BT moiety was incorporated to form the D–A–π–A structure, CPD-2 and CPD-4 show two separate absorptions at 400–700 nm.18CPD-2 exhibits strong absorptions at 524 nm (ε = 4.3 × 104 M−1 cm−1) and 450 nm (ε = 4.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1), while CPD-4 shows two peaks at 516 nm (ε = 4.5 × 104 M−1 cm−1) and 449 nm (ε = 5.0 × 104 M−1 cm−1). We also observed the red shift of the UV-vis absorption with the introduction of the BT group, with about 36 nm for CPD-2 as compared to CPD-1, and a more distinctive shift value of 66 nm for CPD-4 as compared to CPD-3. This red shift demonstrates that the D–A–π–A motif, in which the auxiliary electron-withdrawing unit is incorporated into the dye molecule, is a good strategy to facilitate electron transfer from a donor to an acceptor.

To evaluate the energetics of our synthetic dye molecules, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in deoxygenated THF solution were performed (Fig. 3 and Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The potential was externally calibrated by the ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) couple. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of CPD-1–CPD-4 were estimated to be −5.01, −5.06, −5.07, and −5.12 eV (HOMO) and −3.13, −3.25, −2.77, and −3.22 eV (LUMO), respectively, from the onset of the first oxidation/reduction wave. As a result, their electrochemical energy gaps were determined to be 1.88, 1.81, 2.30, and 1.90 eV. Such values are in agreement with the calculated optical energy gaps (Table S1 in the ESI†). The HOMO energy levels of these dyes seem similar.

TD DFT calculations (B3LYP/6-31G*) were then conducted to gain a better understanding of the CPDT dyes. Their frontier molecular orbital profiles and calculated energy levels are shown in Fig. 4. The HOMO of CPD-1 is delocalized through the entire molecule, while its LUMO is mainly distributed at the CPDT and the acid binding moiety. CPD-2 shares a similar electron distribution pattern to CPD-1, but with its HOMO more delocalized at the NP unit due to the additional BT group. The longest-wavelength absorption maxima for CPD-1 and CPD-2 are calculated to be 608.0 nm (oscillator strength f = 0.8728) and 776.0 nm (f = 0.6272), respectively (Fig. S2, S3 and Tables S3, S5 in the ESI†). In contrast, the bay-NP linked dyes CPD-3 and CPD-4 show well-separated orbital distributions, with their HOMOs mainly delocalized at the NP unit, and their LUMOs at the CPDT and the acid binding moiety. Due to little overlap of the HOMO and LUMO profiles, CPD-3 and CPD-4 show nearly zero oscillator strength for HOMO to LUMO electronic transitions. As a result, their largest oscillator strength values come from the HOMO−1 to LUMO transition, with absorption maxima at 503.3 nm (f = 1.4112) and 606.7 nm (f = 1.2777), respectively (Fig. S4, S5 and Tables S7, S9 in the ESI†). This also suggests that the peri-linked NP-CPDT dyes should have better light harvesting properties than the bay N-linked dyes. Calculations also show that these four dyes all have similar HOMO energy levels (−4.81 to −4.85 eV) and the introduction of the BT unit decreases the LUMO energy levels. All these are in agreement with the above electrochemical measurements.

The newly synthesized dyes CPD-1–CPD-4 were studied for photovoltaic characterizations with the Co(II)/(III) based electrolyte. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and the corresponding IPCE spectra for CPD-1–CPD-4 cells measured under standard AM1.5 irradiance are shown in Fig. 5 and the device characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The IPCE of CPD-1 covers the whole visible range and reaches a maximum value of 73%, indicating efficient electron injection from the excited dye into TiO2. As a result, the CPD-1 cell exhibited a maximum PCE of 7.16% (Jsc = 13.07 mA cm−2, Voc = 748 mV, FF = 0.73). Under the same conditions, CPD-2 gave a much lower PCE of 5.21% (Jsc = 9.76 mA cm−2, Voc = 746 mV, FF = 0.72), mainly due to the decreased Jsc value. The insertion of an additional BT group for CPD-2 has facilitated its intramolecular charge separation, as a result, the broader IPCE spectra were observed. However, CPD-2 also showed a disjointed electronic structure due to the lower conjugation of the BT group with the NP and CPD units (Fig. 4), which has eventually led to a less efficient electron injection process. Therefore, the maximum IPCE value for CPD-2 decreases considerably (<52%). For CPD-3 and CPD-4 dyes with the NP unit linked through the bay position, lower PCE values were obtained. The most distinct difference is the onset of IPCE for CPD-3 and CPD-4 has blue shifted by 60 nm and 110 nm, respectively, as compared to their peri-position linked derivatives CPD-1 and CPD-2. Although Voc and FF remained almost constant for CPD-3 and CPD-4, the Jsc values were decreased to 8.75 and 9.08 mA cm−2, respectively. As a result, PCEs of 4.70% and 5.01% were obtained for CPD-3 and CPD-4.

In order to further improve the device performance, the synthetic CPD dyes were co-adsorbed with deoxycholic acid (DCA) to reduce the charge recombination and dye aggregation.19 The peri-NP linked CPD dyes showed different results from the bay-NP linked CPD dyes. The efficiencies of CPD-1 and CPD-2 were further improved to 7.82% and 5.62%. In contrast, CPD-3 and CPD-4 showed decreased PCE values of 4.31% and 4.53%, respectively.
To further understand the dye structure–device performance relationship, electrochemical impedance measurements were conducted on the CPD-1–CPD-4 cells under illumination and in open-circuit states. As commonly understood, Voc is intimately correlated to the conduction band (CB) position and the charge recombination rate.20Fig. 6a shows the dependence of the chemical capacitance (Q) of the four cells on Voc. At a fixed bias voltage, the difference in chemical capacitance indicates that the CB position of TiO2 slightly varies among the four cells. The CPD-3 cell presented the largest upward shift of the CB while CPD-1 the least,21 but the Voc difference is not so big. Fig. 6b shows the recombination resistance (Rct) of the cells at different Q. At a fixed electron density, the Rct values for all four cells are only slightly different from each other. The above two factors led to a quite similar Voc for all cells. Thus, the superior performance of CPD-1 is due to its better light harvesting properties, which result in a higher photocurrent.

In summary, two types of NP functionalized CPDT dyes were prepared and tested in DSCs. As compared to the bay-NP linked dyes CPD-3 and CPD-4, the peri-NP linked CPD-1 and CPD-2 dyes gave relatively high power conversion efficiency due to more efficient intramolecular charge transfer and good light harvesting properties. Among them, CPD-1 exhibits 7.8% PCE with DCA. Further work to improve the device performance by modifying perylene-based dyes is currently underway.
