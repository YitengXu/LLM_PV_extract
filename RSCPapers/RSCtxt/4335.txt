    , Accepted 16th May 2016First published on 16th May 2016AbstractWe report a 3D flexible electrode, with a Cu nanowire array/polyimide membrane as the platform and nickel–phytate nanoplates as the electroactive material, used as an efficient water oxidation electrode and a favorable positive electrode for supercapacitors. The fabricated 3D electrode shows improved electrochemical performance, revealing the enhanced current density and ultra long-term electrochemical stability (7 days for electrocatalysis with 6% current density loss and 20000 cycles for the galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements with 12% areal capacitance loss). With deep analysis, the crucial factors determining the great enhanced performance could be the outstanding electron transfer provided by the 3D-nanowires support, the large electrochemically active surface area (EASA) and the formation of NiOx species with a high oxidation state. Moreover, the growth mechanism of the Ni–phytate compounds is carefully investigated. Importantly, this green approach considered to be a corrosion-growth process is conducted under mild conditions and involves the application of phytic acid, abundant in living organisms, could have potential in future research.
Introduction
The growing energy crisis, coupled with global warming, is driving researchers to develop more approaches for efficient energy storage and conversion systems, such as water splitting, supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries and fuel cells.1–4 As one of the most desirable processes for harvesting and storing natural sunlight as chemical energy, water-splitting has attracted much attention for converting solar energy into oxygen and hydrogen.5 The cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been well-studied recently. Specifically, some non-precious-metal based materials exhibit ultra-high HER performance with low overpotentials (<100 mV),6–9 which are very close to platinum. However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water-splitting is kinetically sluggish due to a large energy barrier.10–12 Moreover, large-scale application of the state-of-the-art noble metal based water oxidation electrocatalysts is limited by their high price and rareness. Therefore, to establish less expensive, more abundant and efficient oxygen-evolving catalysts still remains a great challenge. Currently, transition metal-based materials, such as nickel and cobalt, have been widely studied in previous work.13–22 Many of them have achieved interesting results, even already overtaking the performances of RuO2 and IrO2.20–22 But the high power consumption in the electrolysis of water is also a challenge because of the high overpotential of the anodic reaction. Therefore, the exploration of advanced catalysts for water oxidation is the most crucial issue to cheaply produce hydrogen.
Among the numerous transition metal catalysts for OER, Ni-based materials are one of the most promising candidates due to their abundance, low-cost, eco-friendliness and high performance. Ni–M oxide,23 Ni–M layered double hydroxide,5,21,24 Ni–M oxyhydroxide (M refers to Fe or Co),16 NiSx (ref. 20) and Ni3N18 are well investigated as robust OER catalysts in strong alkaline electrolyte (pH > 12). Besides, Daniel G. Nocera and his co-workers also found Ni–Bi thin films,25,26 which are generated from Ni2+ aqueous solution containing borate, exhibited admirable activities in mild electrolyte with the existence of proton accepting species (borate for instance). The mechanism of oxygen-evolution for Ni-based catalysts is generally considered as the followed steps.27,28 Ni2+ + 3OH− ↔ NiOOH + H2O + e−, E = 1.4 V(1) NiOOH + OH− ↔ NiO(OH)2 + e−, E = 1.43 V(2) NiO(OH)2 + 2OH− ↔ NiOO2 + 2H2O + 2e−, E = 1.55 V(3) NiOO2 + OH− → NiOOH + O2 + e−(4)
As we all know, the as-defined materials are gradually transformed during the redox process. Hence, NiOOH can be easily grown on the surface of Ni-based materials as active centers,18,20,29 which is regarded as the vital determinant for efficient conversion of OH− into oxygen.
With the development of portable and wearable electronics, flexible devices have been paid extensive attention.30–36 Ni–M oxide32–34 (M refers to Co and Mo) and Ni(OH)2 (ref. 37–40) have been widely studied as admirable pseudocapacitive-type flexible supercapacitors (SCs) due to the presence of multiple oxidation states and, importantly, the active materials can be easily grown on a soft platform. Herein, selecting a suitable substrate is the basic condition for fabricating flexible SCs. Metal-coated polymers, such as polyethylenenaphthalate (PEN), polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), polyethersulfone (PES) and polyimides (PI), are good alternative current collectors due to their thinness, light-weight and flexibility.39,41 Especially, a polyimide membrane covered with Cu is generally used as a flexible printed circuit (FPC) in the field of microelectronics due to its outstanding thermal, chemical and mechanical performance, and is considered as one of the most promising flexible plastic substrates.42
In this work, we report a 3D flexible electrode (3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs) based on nickel–phytate nanoplates (NiNPAs) grown on a Cu nanowires array/Cu-coated polyimide membrane (3D-NA/PI) which shows remarkable electrochemical activity. According to our latest work about Co–phytate,43 the 3D architecture could offer more efficient electron transfer pathways between the catalysts and substrates, further leading to a decline of the grain boundary resistance. Besides, the improved OER activities and specific capacitance in this work have also verified that the 3D-NA substrate fabricated by Cu-coated polyimide film plays an essential role in the enhanced electrochemical performance. The peculiar jagged nanoplates are formed in a green way via facilely immersing the fresh active nickel plating into a phytic acid aqueous solution at room temperature. Then, the growth mechanism of Ni–phytate compounds is further investigated. Specifically, phytic acid (C6H6(H2PO4)6, also called inositol hexaphosphoric acid) is a natural and non-toxic substance and has been wildly studied in the field of biology, pharmacy, food and material science.44 Its mixed salts, such as calcium, magnesium and potassium phytate (known as phytines), are ubiquitous in most cereal grains, legumes, nuts, tubers, pollen and organic soils and are regarded as the primary phosphorus source in living organisms. Since phytic acid has a peculiar structure (12 neighbouring protonation sites), it can strongly couple with multi-metal cations. Meanwhile, the metal ions react with other phytate anions. Consequently, cross-linked Ni–phytate compounds can be easily constructed and dissolved into the weak acid solution provided by phytic acid. Due to the strong coordination and weakly acidic properties, phytic acid is considered to be the best candidate to generate jagged nanoplates compared with phosphoric acid. The fabricated 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs electrode both presents favorable OER and capacitor behaviour evaluated by the high current response and ultra long-term stability. Even at flexural conditions, the 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs electrode can also function well, suggesting the as-prepared electrodes could be considered as a promising candidate to be applied to construct flexible devices for capacitors. To study the behavior of Ni–phytate catalysts during the electrochemical process, it is necessary to analyze the structure and morphology before and after electrochemical measurement. The results show NiOx species with a high valence state and amorphous nature have been found and the nanofiber-shape covering the bulky nanoplates could act as the essential electrochemical active centers.
Experimental section
Construction of 3D nanoarray (3D-NA) supports on Cu-coated PI film
A typical approach to obtain Cu(OH)2 nanowires on copper substrates is shown as follows.45 Prior polished Cu-coated PI was immersed into 10 mL of a 7.5 mmol L−1 CuSO4 aqueous solution for 5 min, and then 10 mL of 0.4 mol L−1 Na2O2 was added. After 20 min, a blue layer appeared on the surface of the Cu foil. The Cu foil covered with Cu(OH)2 nanowires was reduced by 20 mL of 0.4 mol L−1 NaBH4 to form the 3D-NA substrate. For the construction of densely arrayed Cu wires, we repeated the above Na2O2–NaBH4 treatment another two times.
Coating active nickel plating on the substrate
The techniques for electroless coating of a metal surface on various substrates have been well established previously.46,47 Firstly, nickel sulfate hexahydrate acted as the Ni2+ source, and sodium acetate and tri-sodium citrate used as the complexing agents were completely dissolved in deionized water, separately. Then, these two solutions were mixed together with addition of sodium hypophosphite serving as the reducing agent based on the chemical content of the coating bath in Table S1.† Subsequently, the obtained mixture (coating bath) was heated to 90 °C with stirring. Electroless deposition of nickel on 3D-NA or planar Cu-coated PI (PL) was conducted in a coating bath for several minutes to form 3D-NA/Ni (Ni coated on 3D-NA) or PL/Ni (Ni coated on PL) with a silver-white metallic luster. The chemical composition of the coating bath and its operating conditions are given in Table S1.†
Nickel–phytate nanoplates grown in situ on active nickel plating
3D-NA/Ni or PL/Ni was immersed into a 1 M phytic acid aqueous solution. With the oxidation and coordination of phytic acid, some bubbles appeared at the surface of the active nickel plating. When the reaction was complete, the colour on the electrode surface changed from silvery white to black. Then 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs or PL/Ni/NiNPAs was washed with distilled water and dried in air for further tests. Moreover, the mass loading of active materials grown on the substrate was determined by the weight difference between the substrate (3D-NA or PL) and the electrode obtained at a fixed time of coating and immersion and the final values were generally the average of 5 individual electrodes, and are listed in Table S6.†
Characterizations
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Fangyuan DX-1000 powder X-ray diffractometer (China) with Cu Ka radiation at 40 kV. Attenuated total reflection infrared spectra (ATR-IR) were recorded with a NICOLET 6700 FTIR spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher USA). X-ray fluorescence spectra (XRF) were obtained with a Axios XRF spectrometer (PANalytical B.V.). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was carried out on a field emission Hitachi S4800 microscope (Japan). Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS) was performed on an EDAX detector (USA). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were recorded by a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S (USA) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were acquired with a Kratos AXIS ULTRA DLD Photoelectron Spectroscope (UK). Depth-profiling XPS spectra were performed via etching the sample surface with an Ar+ ion gun. Raman spectra of the powder samples were recorded on a LabRAM HR Raman microscope (Horiba, France) with a laser excitation wavelength of 532 nm.
Electrochemical measurements
All tests were carried out at room temperature on a computer-controlled Autolab PGSTAT 12 potentiostat/galvanostat (Metrohm, Switzerland) with a three-electrode system using the platform of Nova 1.11 software. The prepared catalysts on Cu were used as the working electrode and the geometrical surface area in the electrolyte was precisely controlled by a tap and kept at ∼0.5 × 0.5 cm2 for OER measurements as well as ∼1.0 × 1.0 cm2 for capacitance measurements. Besides, Hg/HgO was used as reference electrode throughout the experiments; Pt foil and a graphite electrode acted as the counter electrode for the OER and capacitance measurements, respectively. As for the OER performance tests, the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) and linear sweeping voltammograms (LSVs) were obtained by sweeping the potential from 0 to +0.8 V vs. Hg/HgO in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution (pH = 13.2) with a sweep rate of 50 mV s−1 and 2 mV s−1, separately. The potentials in the paper were versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) through calibration equations: E(RHE) = 0.059 × pH + E(Hg/HgO) + 0.098. For comparison, RuO2 (Alfa Aesar, UK) ink was prepared by mixing 3 mg of RuO2, 500 μL of distilled water–isopropyl alcohol (18:7, v/v) and 10 μL of Nafion solution (5% wt, Dupont, USA), which was dropped onto Cu-coated PI with a mass loading of 0.28 mg cm−2. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded at a fixed potential in 1 M KOH using the electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT 12 potentiostat/galvanostat equipped with a FRA32 M module) in the frequency range of 10−2 to 105 Hz. And the corresponding solution resistance as well as electron transfer resistance were obtained by fitting the equivalent circuit diagram on Nova 1.11 software of Metrohm. The iR drop of all electrochemical measurements was then corrected according to the uncompensated resistance. As for the capacitance measurements, CVs, galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves and EIS were conducted in 6 M KOH aqueous solution with a three-electrode configuration at the same electrochemical workstation as above. Specifically, the EIS measurements for capacitance behaviors were performed at the open circuit potentials with a frequency range from 10−2 to 105 Hz with an ac signal amplitude of 5 mV.
Results and discussion
Construction and characterization of the as-prepared electrodes
The fabrication of the flexible electrode is demonstrated in Scheme 1 and the details are provided in the experimental section. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images are firstly used to characterize the morphology of each electrode as shown in Fig. 1. They prove that Cu nanowires are directly grown on the Cu–PI substrate (Fig. 1a) with a diameter of 80–100 nm. From the high magnification image (inset), we can observe the wheat-like nanowires covered with loose and rich-porous structures caused by a great deal of gas generation on the surface of the Cu–PI substrate during Na2O2–NaBH4 treatment, which has been carefully investigated in our previous work.43Fig. 1b shows the active nickel plating is deposited on the 3D-NA substrate and the inset demonstrates that the Cu nanowires are definitely wrapped into the plating layer. The as-prepared 3D-NA/Ni was subsequently immersed into 1 M phytate acid to form the nanoplate structures with thin and varied thicknesses, as indicated in Fig. 1c. The cross-sectional view of 3D-NA/Ni (Fig. 1d) also reveals the active nickel plating is well constructed on the 3D-NA substrate with a thickness of 2 μm. Fig. S1† shows the high-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) of the Ni–phytate nanoplates. The TEM image in Fig. S1a† reveals the edge of the nanoplates is much thinner than the central area because of the transparent nature observed at the edge of the nanoplates. The crystal lattice fringes can be clearly observed in the high-magnified TEM image from Fig. S1b.† A series of concentric rings in the SAED pattern demonstrates the polycrystalline nature of Ni–phytate.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, Raman spectra, attenuated total reflection infrared spectra (ATR-IR), and X-ray fluorescence spectra (XRF) were further obtained to determine the composition of the as-prepared electrodes. Fig. 2a demonstrates the XRD of 3D-NA/Ni and no additional peaks are observed except three main peaks from the Cu substrate, suggesting the active nickel plating is amorphous. After 3D-NA/Ni was immersed in 1 M phytic acid for 12 h, there are four new peaks (marked with ●) observed in the XRD pattern of 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs, implying Ni–phytate composites have formed on the 3D-NA/Ni substrate. The Raman peaks (as shown in Fig. S2†) at 558, 584, 816, 920, 1225, 1370, 1490 and 1517 cm−1 are assigned to Ni–O, O–P–O deformation, P–O–C rock stretching, P–O–(H or metal) stretching, C–H bending of cyclohexyl ring out of plane, P–O stretching, and ring C–H bending,48–50 respectively. Moreover, the ATR-IR spectrum of the as-prepared 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs electrode before measurement is provided and the typical peaks of phytate are marked in Fig. S3,† indicating the generation of a Ni–phytate substance on the electrode.51,52 Furthermore, XRF was also applied to analyze the content of various elements for each electrode in Fig. S4 and S5 and Table S2.† As shown in Table S2,† the primary elements of the electrode surface for 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs are Ni, O, P and Cu, while for 3D-NA/Ni, the surface is mainly composed of the elements Ni and P. This is because the electroless deposition introduces phosphorus during the reaction process of sodium hypophosphite.43 Compared with 3D-NA/Ni, 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs contains abundant oxygen and the high relative content of phosphorus indicates the generation of Ni–phytate compounds. To explore the electronic interaction between the elements on the electrode surface, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed as follows. Fig. S6† and 2b prove the presence of Ni, C, O, P and Cu both on the 3D-NA/Ni and 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs electrodes. The Ni 2p and P 2p spectra of the 3D-NA/Ni substrate reveal Ni is composed of Ni(II) and Ni(0) and P is composed of P(III) and P(0),53,54 which could be due to the fresh Ni plating surface being partly oxidized during the plating process and the NaH2PO2-containing coating bath introducing the P element.53 In comparison with 3D-NA/Ni, 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs exhibits many differences in the high resolution XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 2c, the Ni 2p spectrum mainly exhibits doublet peaks at 856.3 and 862.0 eV as well as a tiny peak at 852.5 eV, suggesting most of the metallic Ni is converted into a divalent Ni oxidation state. Specifically, the Ni(II) peaks show a slightly negative shift contrasted with 3D-NA/Ni, which is possibly ascribed to the formation of Ni–phytate composites affecting the binding energy of the 2p electron orbital.55 As for the P 2p spectrum, the peak at 133.6 eV belongs to the phosphate group of the Ni–phytate compounds.55 In regard to C 1s, the peaks at 288.5 eV and 286.1 eV (from Fig. 2e) could be assigned to the C–O and C–C groups5 in the phytate derivatives, while these two binding energies are not observed in the 3D-NA/Ni substrate. In summary, the analysis results above all prove Ni–phytate compounds have been successfully generated on the electrode surface.

OER performance of the as-prepared electrodes
The OER performances of the various electrodes were measured in 1 M KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with Hg/HgO and Pt film as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. Fig. 3a displays the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs (the final mass loading of active material on the 3D-NA substrate was determined as 0.30 mg cm−2), PL/Ni/NiNPAs (the final mass loading of active materials on the PL substrate was determined as 0.30 mg cm−2), RuO2 (with the mass loading 0.28 mg cm−2 drop-casted on the PL substrate and 3D-NA substrate), 3D-NA/Ni substrate and 3D-Ni substrate. As shown in Fig. 3a, RuO2 coated on the 3D-NA substrate (3D-NA/RuO2) shows enhanced OER activity compared with RuO2 coated on the PL substrate (PL/RuO2), while it shows a much lower current density than 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs. At the current density of 25 mA cm−2, 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs exhibits a much lower overpotential (η = 340 mV) than PL/Ni/NiNPAs (η = 380 mV), PL/RuO2 (η = 400 mV) and 3D-NA/RuO2 (η = 368 mV). The OER performance of Ni-based electrocatalysts in recent reports and our work have been compared in Table S4.† In addition, the 3D-NA and 3D-NA/Ni substrates exert a low current density, which reveals the OER activity of 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs mostly comes from the Ni–phytate nanoplates. Tafel curves are further fitted in Fig. 3b and used to evaluate the kinetics during the OER process. The smaller Tafel slope of 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs (96 mV dec−1) indicates the current density sees a more rapid rise than PL/Ni/NiNPAs (98 mV dec−1) with increasing potential. Besides, a smaller Tafel slope is also observed on 3D-NA/RuO2 (67 mV dec−1), suggesting the 3D-NA substrate exhibits more efficient conductivity than the PL substrate. Furthermore, long-term durability is an important criterion for a good OER catalyst. Here, chronoamperometric measurements of 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs were conducted continuously for a long period of 7 days at 1.57 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH in Fig. 3c, showing a slight current density loss of 6%. Such excellent stability has seldom been reported in previous works and this electrode exhibits great application potential in commercial production, even to replace RuO2. The essential reason for the ultra-long OER stability is probably due to the particular nanostructure of 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs. As shown in Fig. S1a,† the TEM image reveals the edge of nanoplates to be much thinner than in the centre. That means the Ni–phytate nanoplates are in situ grown from the surface of 3D-NA/Ni and are not stacked on the other nanoplates from Fig. 1c. In addition, there are numerous spaces among the nanoplates for efficiently releasing oxygen bubbles (Fig. 1c). Therefore, the Ni–phytate nanoplates show a staggered and self-supported nanostructure, making the active sites more stable during the OER process than the other catalysts coated on the substrate. A comparison of the LSV curves before and after electrolysis is demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 3c, and shows a slight positive shift of oxidation peak potential and a declined current density at high potential. This is possibly ascribed to the original Ni–phytate compounds transforming into NiOx species during the electrocatalysis process. Moreover, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) at 1.57 V vs. RHE were also investigated to analyse the electron transfer resistance (Rct). The EIS of 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs before and after 7 days' electrocatalysis do not show great changes from the inset (II) of Fig. 3c. As shown in Fig. S7,† 3D-NA/Ni and 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs reveal a much smaller semicircular diameter at high frequency contrasted with the PL-substrate-based electrode, meaning the introduction of a 3D architecture will lead to a decline in Rct. That is to say the electron transfer is more rapid on the 3D-NA substrate than on the PL substrate. Additionally, the values of Rct are calculated according to the fitted equivalent circuit diagram and listed in Table S3.† The electrical double-layer capacitances (Cdl) of several electrodes were also calculated according to the fitting curves (Fig. S8f†) of the current density (at the designated potential) vs. scan rate, and could be used to appraise the electrochemically active surface area (EASA).19 Thus, a higher value of Cdl reflects a larger EASA, revealing the 3D architecture will bring about an increase in electroactive sites and further enhance the OER performance. We also compare the actual oxygen production (obtained by detecting the dissolved oxygen via an oxygen sensor) to the theoretical oxygen production in Fig. S9.† It is clear that the two curves almost perfectly match implying the faradaic efficiency is close to 100%. This means the PL/Ni/NiNPAs and 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs electrodes can effectively convert electrons to oxygen molecules. The 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs electrode was further used as a catalyst for oxygen-evolution in neutral conditions (0.025 M sodium tetraborate, pH = 9.2). The polarization curves recorded in Fig. S10† exhibit a desirable current density at a low overpotential as well.

Capacitive performance of the as-prepared electrodes
Electrochemical measurements for the capacitive performance were conducted in a three-electrode system, where Hg/HgO and graphite were used as the reference and counter electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was firstly applied to describe the capacitive behaviors, as shown in Fig. 4a, and was recorded at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in 6 M KOH. As shown here, 3D-NA/Ni, PL/Ni/NiNPAs and 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs display a pair of symmetric redox peaks, revealing a desirable reversibility and probably involving the transformation of Ni(II) and Ni(III).37–39 The redox peaks are related to the faradaic reactions of the NiOx species:Ni–phytate + 3OH− → NiOOH + H2O + e−, (1st cycle)NiOOH + H2O + e− ↔ Ni(OH)2 + OH−. (after 1st cycle)

As we all know, the specific areal or mass capacitance (C, mF cm−2 or F g−1) can be determined from CVs by the formula , where I, V, and v are defined as the current density (mA cm−2, A g−1), potential (V) and scan rate (V s−1). Accordingly, it is obvious that the specific areal capacitance of 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs is much larger than 3D-NA/Ni and PL/Ni/NiNPAs since it has a higher current density. From the EIS at the open circuit potential in Fig. S11,† the semicircle region at high frequency and the spike at low frequency indicate the dynamical process is controlled by Rct and ion diffusion. It is known that a small semicircular diameter reflects a small Rct as described above. Thus, the 3D-NA substrate exhibits a better electrical conductivity than the PL substrate, which is possibly because the 3D-NA substrate provides a high surface area to grow the Ni–phytate nanoplates and channels for electron transfer. That is to say the introduction of Cu nanowires will sufficiently expose the active sites and significantly improve the efficiency of charge transfer, matching with the mechanism of enhanced performance for OER. Fig. 4b demonstrates the CVs of 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs at a scan rate of 5–50 mV s−1. These are in agreement with the rules reported in most works that with increasing scan rate, the current density as well as the gap between oxidation peaks and negative peaks both increase.
This is because the internal resistance of the electrode is enlarged by a fast scan rate.37 The areal capacitance of 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs was further quantified by galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements according to the following equation: , where I, t, and V are assigned to the charge or discharge current density (mA cm−2), time (s) and potential (V). Fig. 4c shows the discharge curves at a series of current densities ranging from 1–50 mA cm−2. The corresponding specific areal and mass capacitance (obtained by dividing the specific areal capacitance by the average mass loading of 0.3 mg cm−2) is plotted in Fig. 4d, and shows the specific capacitance of the 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs electrode is about 1064 mF cm−2 and 3546 F g−1 at the current density of 1 mA cm−2 and declines with increasing current density. The value stays at around 650 mF cm−2 and 2166 F g−1 when the current density increases to 50 mA cm−2, implying superior charge transfer and ion diffusion efficiency even at such a fast electron exchange process.37 Moreover, long-term GCD measurement is an important standard to evaluate the stability of the as-fabricated electrodes (Fig. 4e), especially at a high current density. After the first 200 cycles, the capacitance is enhanced, which is possibly due to the formation of small Ni(OH)2 nanosheets on the electrode surface leading to exposure of more active sites.37,56 After the following 20000 cycles, the capacitance remains stable (about 88% retained relative to the 200th cycle), which means the 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs electrode shows a desirable long cycle life even at a current density of 100 mA cm−2. Owing to the activation process of the electrode during the initial GCD cycles, the coulombic efficiency rises from 30% (at the first cycle) to ∼100% (at the 150th cycle) and is maintained at around 100% in the remaining cycles. Such excellent coulombic efficiency implies 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs has perfect reversibility. The capacitance performances of Ni-based materials in recent literature and our work are listed and compared in Table S5.† We further compared the Nyquist curves before and after 200 cycles in Fig. S11† and a larger electron transfer resistance after cycling is obtained, which is probably caused by the generation of Ni–O species and the collapse of the original structure during the cyclic process.
Criteria associated with electrochemical performance for preparing electrodes
We found that the electrochemical performance (OER and capacitive activity) was strongly influenced by active Ni plating, the time of coating and immersion (in 1 M phytic acid) as well as treatment with different acids. As shown in Fig. S12,† the soaking treatment in phytic acid for 13 h will bring about improved OER performance of both the commercial Ni film and PL/Ni substrate. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity is probably due to phytic acid being able to strongly bond with metal and corrode the electrode surface leading to the formation of Ni–phytate with a high specific area, which can efficiently promote water oxidation and capacitance. There are few differences observed between the CVs of the commercial Ni film treated with and without phosphoric acid. However, the OER activity of PL/Ni/Ni-phosphate and the redox peaks decline compared with the PL/Ni substrate as the strongly acidic conditions of phosphoric acid quickly dissolve the active Ni plating on the electrode surface (as shown in the inset (I) of Fig. S12b†) and cannot generate the ordered nanoplates. The capacitive performance of the electrodes can also be evaluated by the CVs in Fig. S12,† which reveal the treatment of phytic acid does indeed improve the faradaic pseudocapacitance. This is ascribed to the formation of Ni–phytate with a high specific area providing more active sites for electron exchange between the active materials and electrolyte. In addition, the electrochemical activities including OER and capacitive performance were investigated for different times of coating (active Ni plating deposition) and immersion (in 1 M phytic acid) in Fig. S13.† When the coating time of nickel on the 3D-NA substrate was prolonged, the current density and areal capacitance for the corresponding 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs (with an immersion time of 13 h) both increased. A longer time of Ni deposition (20–30 min) does not bring about a significant promotion of electrochemical activities. As for the study of phytic acid treatment of the 3D-NA/Ni substrate (with a coating time of 7 min), extending the immersion time for the first 13 h will markedly improve the current density and areal capacitance. However, continued treatment in phytic acid (up to 18 h) will result in a decrease of OER and capacitive performance. Combining the quantitative analysis (listed in Table S6†) of Ni plating and active material and the SEM images of 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs at several immersion times (Fig. S14†), we can obtain some insight into the electrochemical activity changes with different coating and immersion times. As expected, the specific mass of Ni plating and electroactive materials increases with prolonged coating times, which implies the thickness of Ni plating per square centimeter increases as well. So the improvement of OER and capacitive performance is possibly due to the increase of active material within a short period of coating time. But, the active Ni plated coating is too thick after 20–30 min, making the electron transport from the active material to the Cu–PI substrate difficult and leading to the suppression of electrochemical activity. Similarly, an increase of immersion time will promote the formation of Ni–phytate nanoplates and also decrease the thickness of Ni plating, which synergistically enhances the performance of OER and faradaic capacitance. When the immersion time is extended up to 18 h, the specific mass of the active substance is barely 0.09 mg cm−2 and the electro-activities become difficult. Since the active materials are in situ grown on the flexible substance, it is necessary to characterize the OER and capacitive behaviors at flexural conditions. Therefore, the cyclic voltammograms (Fig. S15†) for the 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs electrode at normal and bent conditions were obtained in 1 M KOH at the scan rate of 50 mV s−1. It is clear that the CVs at the two states show little difference suggesting the fabricated flexible electrode can function well in extreme conditions. To appraise the chemical stability of the as-prepared electrode, the OER performance and XRD analysis of the 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs electrode exposed to ambient air for several months were also studied, revealing subtle changes compared to the freshly fabricated electrode.
Structure and morphology of the transformed electrode surface
To clearly understand the transformation of substances on the electrode surface before and after the electrochemical measurements, XRD, Raman, ATR-IR, XPS depth profiling spectra, SEM and TEM were carried out to characterize structure and morphology of 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs after electrochemical oxidation in 1 M KOH at 1.48 V vs. RHE (0.6 V vs. Hg/HgO). As shown in Fig. 5a, the electrode after electrocatalysis for 30 min still showed the peaks of Ni–phytate at 23.0, 28.6, 36.1 and 47.4 degrees (marked with ●), but exhibited lower intensity and broader peaks than the 3D/Ni/NiNPAs electrode, which might be ascribed to NiOx species in situ forming and covering the Ni–phytate nanoplates. Further, the Raman spectrum also supplies evidence of the transformation of surface materials after electrocatalysis as a broad peak at 400–600 cm−1 is obtained. Based on previous reports, this wide peak displayed in Fig. 5b is possibly attributed to the presence of NiO, Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH.29 As for the electrode before electrolysis, the Raman pattern shows two separate sharp peaks at 557 and 584 cm−1, which can be attributed to Ni–O and O–P–O in the Ni–phytate composites.48,50 Moreover, the ATR-IR spectrum after electrolysis is also shown in Fig. S3.† Compared with the as prepared 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs, the electrode after electrolysis lacks the characteristic peaks of Ni–phytate, but a narrow band at ∼1380 cm−1 and a broad peak at 3000–3800 cm−1 still remain. This is probably because the CO vibration of the absorbed CO2 molecules in the NiOx species57 and some OH- or H2O-containing species, like Ni(OH)2, NiOOH and NiO·xH2O, are generated during the electrolysis process. The survey scan depth-profiling XPS spectra (Fig. S17†) and high-resolution spectra of Ni 2p (Fig. 5c) for the 3D-Ni/Ni/NiNPAs electrode after electrolysis (for 10 min) were further explored to analyze the content and species from the surface to the inside of the bulk. After Ar+ ion etching, the main elemental composition, including O, Cu, P, Ni and C, is not changed from Fig. S17.† While, the relative mass content of Ni, O, P reveals many differences. From Fig. 5d, the Ni and P content all grow with increasing etched depth, while the O content decreases. From the high-resolution XPS of Ni 2p in Fig. 5c, the Ni(II) peak is shifted from 855.5 eV to 856.4 eV and a Ni(0) peak emerges at 852.5 eV with increased etched depth. The lower binding energy (855.5 eV) of the surface materials reveals the transformed structure could be NiOOH or NiOx species with high valence state.58 Specifically, the Ni(II) (856.4 eV) and Ni(0) (852.5 eV) peaks are consistent with the Ni 2p spectrum of 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs in Fig. 2c. The content and species changes are possibly due to the increasing Ar+ ion etched depth gradually devastating the species on the surface of the electrode along the sequence of the generated NiOx species (outer), the Ni–phytate compounds (middle) and the Ni plating (inner). Correspondingly, the microstructures are greatly changed after electrochemical oxidation just for 10 min. As shown in Fig. 5e, the morphology still remains as a bulky nanoplate structure similar to the electrode appearance before electrolysis. However, the high magnification SEM shows the aggregate nanofibers in situ grow on the large nanoplates making the original smooth nanostructure more rough and fluffy. Moreover, the low-resolution TEM images (Fig. 5f) also reveal nanofibers covering the bulky structure, which is very different from the Ni–phytate nanoplates before water oxidation. From the high-resolution TEM (the inset of Fig. 5f), the nanofibers with a diameter of 5–6 nm show clear but disordered crystal lattice fringes marked in the white, mainly composed of lattice spacings of 0.242 nm and 0.143 nm from Fig. S18a.† They match well with NiO (JCPDS 89-7131) and NiOOH (JCPDS 06-0075). Combined with the SAED pattern in Fig. S18b,† the nanofibers have been proved to be amorphous. The changes in structure and morphology could be the reason why the areal capacitance and coulombic efficiency are enhanced at the initial GCD cycles.

Mechanism of formation of the Ni–phytate nanoplates
The outstanding OER performance and capacitive behaviors could be due to the following factors; the architecture of the three-dimensional Cu nanowires, the formation of Ni–phytate nanoplates and the generation of NiOx species with small substructures. As mentioned above, 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs has a smaller Rct both at fixed potential and open circuit potential (OCP) than PL/Ni/NiNPAs, because the 3D Cu nanowires directly grown on the Cu/PI substrate provide straight conduction channels for efficient electron transfer between the catalyst and substrate, according to previous reports.43,59,60 Without the 3D architecture, electrons are partly consumed during the transfer pathway due to great grain boundary resistances between the 2 μm nickel plating, which is discussed in our previous work. However, the introduction of a 3D architecture can also supply sufficient active sites to connect catalysts and electrolyte. Furthermore, the approach of simply immersing the chemically deposited Ni substrate into phytic acid at room temperature forms staggered and self-supported nanoplates with a high specific surface area. However, other acids, like phosphoric acid or hydrochloric acid, would probably corrode the nickel due to their strong acidic properties. Meanwhile, the corresponding products, Ni3(PO4)2 or NiCl2, would be quickly dissolved into the acids (as shown in the inset of Fig. S12b†). Different from the acids mentioned above, phytic acid provides mildly acidic conditions (H+ cannot be fully ionized in solution) and a strong chelating ability caused by the 6 neighbouring phosphate groups, which is beneficial to the formation of this special nanostructure. The mechanism (Scheme 2) proposed as follows and is considered to be a corrosion–growth process. H12Phy ↔ H12−nPhyn− + nH+(5) Ni + 2H+ → Ni2+ + H2↑(6) Ni2+ + H12−nPhyn− → Ni H12−nPhy2−n(7) Ni H12−nPhy2−n + mH+ ↔ NiH12−n+mPhy2+m−n(8)where n is related with the protonation constant. Firstly, some Ni is dissolved into phytic acid by the effect of acid corrosion (6). Once the Ni2+ cations are generated around the electrode surface, phytate anions capture Ni2+ immediately with their strong chelation properties (7). According to reports,43,55 the metal ions not only link with one phytate anion, but also bond with another anion, as indicated in Scheme 2. Then, the remaining phosphate groups sequentially react with the other metal ions. Therefore, the Ni ions and phytate anion crosslink with each other resembling metal–organic frameworks to form aggregate Ni–phytate compounds on the electrode surface. As the phytic acid is a weak acid, these Ni–phytate composites do not decompose into the solution due to the supply of H+ in the inner space. However, protons in the outer space will gradually diffuse to the electrode surface and combine with the Ni–phytate compounds to generate soluble substances (8). Therefore, the reaction will continue until all the active Ni plating transforms into dissolvable Ni–phytate complexes. Thus, the duration of the reaction between the phytic acid and active nickel plating is a crucial factor for OER performance. As we mentioned in the introduction, Ni-based materials are easily transformed into NiOOH at the potential of oxygen-evolution and NiOx species with high valence states are considered to be the electrochemically active site for OER. The formation of NiOx species in a short time of electrolysis has also been proved. This means that the transformed NiOx species with high valence states act as the new active materials for the subsequent electrochemical process.

Conclusions
In summary, a facile and simple approach is used to successfully fabricate a three-dimensional flexible substrate based nickel–phytate electrode (3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs) as an efficient water oxidation catalyst and supercapacitor material. The factors, including 3D architecture, Ni–phytate nanoplates and the formation of NiOx species during electrolysis, show crucial influence in the excellent electrochemical performance. First of all, the 3D nanowires, grown on the active nickel plating, offer more straight conduction channels for electron transfer without overcoming the grain boundary resistance, leading to the decline of Rct during the electrochemical process. Then, the introduction of active nickel plating is beneficial to generate jagged Ni–phytate nanoplates with a large specific surface area. Further, the NiOx species with a high valence state and nanofiber structure provide sufficient active sites. Consequently, 3D-NA/Ni/NiNPAs shows favorable OER performance with a current density of ∼25 mA cm−2 at the low overpotential (η) of 340 mV and super long-term durability (7 days) for electrocatalytic water oxidation. Simultaneously, the as-fabricated electrode also exhibits nice capacitive behaviours, revealing a specific capacitance of 1064 mF cm−2 and 3546 F g−1 at the current density of 1 mA cm−2 as well as adequate cyclic stability (20000 cycles). Particularly, the growth mechanism of the Ni–phytate compounds is proposed as a corrosion–growth process. Importantly, this approach, constructing metal–phytate materials on a 3D flexible substrate, is a good example of the extension of the fabrication method in our latest work, which can be facilely achieved in a green way and enlighten us to design more efficient electrocatalysts.
