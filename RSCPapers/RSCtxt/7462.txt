    , Accepted 8th January 2015First published on 9th January 2015AbstractA novel method has been developed for the preparation of nanostructured haematite (α-Fe2O3) films for use in photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting and the degradation of organic pollutants. The method has two stages, the electrodeposition of Fe films in alkalescent aqueous electrolyte with ferrous sulphate and ammonia, and the in situ thermal oxidation of the Fe films to α-Fe2O3. The thickness and crystallinity of the α-Fe2O3 films can be precisely controlled by adjusting the duration and the annealing conditions of the electrodeposition, respectively, avoiding the microstructural defects arising from the traditional electrodeposition of FeOOH films and the unwanted phases of FeO and Fe3O4 produced by thermal oxidation of Fe foils. This facilitates the generation, transportation and collection of photogenerated charges on the α-Fe2O3 film. The optimized α-Fe2O3 film, obtained from a Fe film deposited for 30 s and then annealed at 500 °C for 2 h, showed a stable PEC water oxidation current around 1.35 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5 irradiation. This was the highest current so far obtained using undoped α-Fe2O3 films produced by electrodeposition. When further coated with a cobalt phosphate (Co–Pi) co-catalyst, the optimized Co–Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanode showed an incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) above 18% at 400 nm and a stable photocurrent of 1.89 mA cm−2. The α-Fe2O3 film also showed excellent stability and degradation efficiency (rate constant 0.9372 h−1) in the PEC degradation of methylene blue (MB) in neutral aqueous solution under a positive bias potential.
1. Introduction
The extensive use of cheap and plentiful energy in the form of fossil fuels has produced a revolution, both in human life and in the natural world. However, fossil fuels are a limited resource, and in addition burning them has a negative impact on the environment. In order to reduce fossil fuel consumption and at the same time address the associated environmental problems, the need to increase the utilization of clean energy, such as solar energy, has been widely acknowledged. It is inspiring that a photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) technique has been developed to solve these problems using sunlight to split water and degrade organic pollutants, following the pioneering work of Fujishima and Honda.1–3
Considerable attention has been devoted to developing an ideal photoelectrode, which is the key to the PEC conversion of solar energy to chemical energy, for example in PEC water splitting and waste water treatment.4–9 Among the various semiconductor materials so far studied (e.g. TiO2, ZnO and WO3),10–14 haematite (α-Fe2O3) is one of the promising due to its small band gap (2.1 eV), which allows it to harvest the energy of about 40% of the solar spectrum, up to a wavelength around 600 nm; it also has excellent stability under alkaline conditions, and it is environmentally benign, naturally abundant and low in cost.15–19 However, the PEC activity of α-Fe2O3 is limited by a number of factors, including the short lifetime of its photogenerated charge carriers (<10 ps), short hole diffusion length (∼2–4 nm), and the poor kinetics of its oxygen evolution reaction.20–24 To address these limitations, a number of strategies have been developed for improving the PEC properties of α-Fe2O3, including modifying its electronic structure by elemental doping,25–27 synthesizing nanostructured α-Fe2O3 in order to shorten the pathway that photoexcited electrons and holes are required to travel,28,29 integrating α-Fe2O3-based composite photoanode with a better conducting material,30,31 and decorating the surface of α-Fe2O3 with a co-catalyst such as cobalt phosphate (Co–Pi), to facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction.32,33
Numerous methods have been reported for preparing the α-Fe2O3 photoanode, including hydrothermal methods,34,35 spray pyrolysis,36,37 DC magnetron sputtering,38 electrodeposition,25,28,39 atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition,33,40 atomic layer deposition41 and anodization.42 Among these, electrodeposition is both convenient and cost-effective.
The reported electrodeposition method for preparing α-Fe2O3 films involves two steps, the first being the electrodeposition of a FeOOH film and the second being calcination. The electrodeposition may be either cathodic or anodic, depending on the nature of the electrolyte. Cathodic electrodeposition involves the electrochemical reduction of H2O2 in a solution containing Fe3+ to form OH−, and the subsequent precipitation of Fe3+ by increased pH in the locality of the cathode to form FeOOH films.25,39 Anodic electrodeposition on the other hand involves the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, followed by precipitation of Fe3+ and the development of FeOOH films near the anode.28 The FeOOH films prepared in this way can be converted to α-Fe2O3 films by calcination.
In summary, the processes for FeOOH film formation by both cathodic and anodic electrodeposition arise from the direct transformation of Fe2+ or Fe3+ to FeOOH films, the reduction of H2O2 to OH−, the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, precipitation of Fe3+ to form FeOOH, and annealing of the FeOOH film to form an α-Fe2O3 film. In this complex process a variety of compounds of Fe2+ and Fe3+ are formed in aqueous solution, including polyhydroxy compounds, polynuclear complexes and bridging ligands.43–46 These occur at the working electrode, causing unavoidable microstructural defects in the FeOOH film deposited, and these are also then present in the final α-Fe2O3 structure.47 Neither cathodic nor anodic electrodeposition gives an orderly arranged FeOOH film.
A number of studies have described the preparation of α-Fe2O3 films by the direct thermal oxidation of Fe foils, which promises a simple way of preparing an α-Fe2O3 photoelectrode.48–51 A variety of iron oxide structures can be formed directly on the Fe foil by varying the annealing conditions, and simple aerial oxidation of iron provides a convenient route to haematite nanowires.50 The thickness and crystallinity of the oxide film is difficult to control, however, due to the rapid oxidation of metallic iron during thermal oxidation of the Fe foil. In addition, the presence of FeO and/or Fe3O4 at the interface of metallic iron and Fe2O3 is unavoidable, and as a result the photoresponse of the α-Fe2O3 photoelectrode is somewhat poor.
Based on the above background, we have been able to propose a novel method for the preparation of α-Fe2O3 films, combining the advantages of electrodeposition and thermal oxidation, and at the same time avoiding their defects. The method involves direct electrodeposition of Fe films on a conductive substrate, such as F-doped tin oxide (FTO), the α-Fe2O3 film being obtained under alkaline conditions on coated glass by adding an excess of ammonia in ferrous sulphate solution, followed by the in situ thermal oxidation of the Fe film to form the α-Fe2O3 film. This method has a number of advantages:
(i) it ensures the uniformity of the deposited Fe film and the resulting α-Fe2O3 film, since the alkaline conditions inhibit the corrosion of the Fe deposited;
(ii) it facilitates the deposition of the Fe film in an orderly manner, since the existence of ferrous hydroxide compounds modifies the reduction of Fe2+ to Fe, and prevents the generation of microstructural defects in the deposited film, which distinguishes it from traditional strategies such as the direct electrodeposition of FeOOH films from Fe2+ or Fe3+;
(iii) it prevents the presence of the undesired phases of FeO and/or Fe3O4 formed during the traditional thermal oxidation of Fe foils, since the uniform and tunable Fe film on the FTO substrate is completely transformed into α-Fe2O3;
(iv) it facilitates the generation and transport or collection of photo-generated charges in the α-Fe2O3 film due to its tunable thickness, phase purity and absence of microstructural defects.
In the present study, the feasibility of the convenient method described above for the preparation of highly photoactive α-Fe2O3 films for effective PEC water splitting and organic pollutant degradation has been investigated. The results indicate that the Fe film deposited can be completely converted into α-Fe2O3, and the thickness and the crystallinity of the resulting α-Fe2O3 film are tunable by adjusting either the duration of the deposition of the Fe film or the annealing conditions.
The effect of annealing temperature and time on the PEC water-splitting performance of α-Fe2O3 films was studied in detail. α-Fe2O3 films decorated with Co–Pi were also prepared by photo-assisted electrodeposition in order to increase the efficiency of oxygen evolution at decreased over-potential. Finally, the effect of PEC organic pollutant degradation with the α-Fe2O3 films has been examined.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of α-Fe2O3 film
The Fe film was first electrodeposited on the F-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate (13 Ω cm−1) in a two-electrode configuration with the FTO glass forming the cathode and a platinum foil the anode (Fig. 1 and ESI Fig. S1†). The distance between the cathode and the anode was 3 cm. The electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 5 g of FeSO4·7H2O and 30 mL of ammonia (27%) in 150 mL of deionized water, giving pH 10.8 at 25 °C. Electrodeposition was carried out at 2 V for 15, 30, 45 and 60 s with vigorous stirring. The Fe film deposited was rinsed with deionized water for 5 min and dried at 50 °C in a gentle stream of nitrogen over 1 h, followed by thermal oxidation in air. The deposition of Co–Pi on the surface of the α-Fe2O3 film was carried out in a three-electrode system with the α-Fe2O3 film forming the working electrode, platinum foil as the counter-electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference, by a photo-assisted electrodeposition (PED) method. 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer solution at pH 7 containing 5 mM Co(NO3)2 was used as electrolyte. The PED was carried out at 0.1 V under illumination provided by an artificial solar light. After PED, the α-Fe2O3 film modified with Co–Pi was rinsed with deionized water for 5 min and dried at 50 °C for 1 h.

2.2 Characterization
The morphology and microstructure of the samples were investigated by FE-SEM (Sirion 200, Philips, Netherlands) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray detector (EDX). XPS spectra were assessed using an AXIS Ultra DLD (Kratos, Shimadzu) using non-chromatic Al Kα radiation at 12 kV and 25 mA. The crystal phase of the samples was determined by X-ray diffractometry (XRD; AXS-8 Advance, Bruker, Germany). Raman spectra were recorded on a Senterra R200 system (Bruker, Germany) with laser excitation at 532 nm. The UV-visible absorption spectra of the samples were recorded on a UV-vis photospectrometer (TU-1901, Beijing Purkinje General Instrument Co.).
2.3 Photoelectrocatalytic measurements
PEC water-splitting experiments were carried out in a 1 M KOH electrolyte using a three-electrode system with a SCE as reference, a platinum foil as the auxiliary electrode, and the prepared films as working electrode. The PEC tests were controlled from an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660c, CH Instruments Inc., USA). A 350 W xenon lamp (Shanghai Hualun Bulb Factory) with AM 1.5 filter was used for light illumination (light density, 100 mW cm−2). Incident photon-to-charge conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a monochromator (Zolix, China), a 500 W xenon arc lamp, calibrated silicon photodetector and a power meter.
The PEC degradation of MB was conducted at pH 7 under vigorous stirring, AM 1.5 irradiation, electric bias 0.6 V (vs. SCE), and with 0.01 mol L−1 sodium sulphate supporting electrolyte. The photocatalytic (PC) degradation was performed without application of an external potential to the working electrodes. The initial concentration of the MB solution was 5 mg L−1 and 25 mL of reaction solution was used. At different time intervals, the reaction solution was analyzed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV2102 PCS, UNICO, Shanghai).
Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) was carried out using an electrochemical workstation (Zennium; effect-Elektrik, Germany) equipped with a controlled intensity-modulated photospectroscopy set-up (CIMPS, PP211), following a three-electrode configuration, with the prepared α-Fe2O3 film as the working electrode, a platinum foil as the counter-electrode, and a SCE as reference electrode with a 1 M KOH electrolyte. A white-light lamp (WLC02; Zahner-Elektrik) was used as light source. Modulated light in the frequency range 0.1–10 KHz superimposed on a steady DC light intensity of 80 mW cm−2 was applied. The bias potential applied at the working electrode was 0.23 V vs. SCE.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Preparation of α-Fe2O3 film
In the present study we have developed an alternative technique for the preparation of Fe films, using electrodeposition in ammonia. In order to understand the effect of ammonia on the electrolyte, a variety of electrolytes were used for electrodepositing the Fe films. The voltammetric curves carried out on FTO substrates in different electrolytes are shown in Fig. 2, and it can be seen that the onset potential increased after the pH had been adjusted using NaOH (curve a vs. curve c, and curve b vs. curve d), and the deposition current increased with increasing concentration of electrolyte (curve a vs. curve b and curve c vs. curve d). However, comparison of curves d and e reveals that the electrodeposition behaviour in the electrolyte containing ammonia differed from that containing NaOH, even though the pH was similar. This suggested that the reaction occurring on the FTO substrate in the electrolyte with ammonia was different from that with NaOH. This speculation was verified by the XRD patterns of the films deposited from the electrolyte with NaOH shown in ESI Fig. S2,† which indicated that the deposited films were tetragonal Sn films. However, the XRD patterns of the film deposited from the electrolyte containing ammonia shown in Fig. 3(A) indicated that it was a cubic Fe film. From the inset in Fig. 1, this Fe film had a matt black colour and showed good uniformity, and was well adhered to the substrate. The presence of ammonia thus led to a significant improvement in the uniformity of the deposited Fe film and prevented the reduction of SnO2 occurring under strongly alkaline (NaOH) conditions. A more detailed discussion is given in the ESI.†

 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of α-Fe2O3 film (deposited for 30 s) annealed at (A) different temperatures for 2 h, and (B) at 500 °C for various lengths of time. 
The Fe films were annealed in air at different temperatures for various lengths of time, and their XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(A) shows the XRD patterns of Fe film annealed at temperatures ranging from 300 to 700 °C for 2 h. It can be seen that the cubic phase of the Fe film changed to an amorphous phase at 300 °C, and the characteristic peaks of α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS no. 890598) appeared at 400 °C. When annealed at 500 °C the intensity of the (110) peak was the strongest, the intensity of (104) peak increased at 600 °C, and the (012) peak appeared at 700 °C.

Fig. 3(B) shows XRD patterns of Fe film annealed at 500 °C for different lengths of time. The (110) peak of haematite appeared after annealing for 0.5 h and became more intense after a further 2 h. When the time of annealing was further extended, a new (012) peak appeared and the intensity of the (104) peak clearly increased. In contrast, there was no significant change in the (110) peak. It is notable that the (110) peak first appeared during annealing, applying that the α-Fe2O3 film had preferred orientation in the (110) direction. This is a favourable result, since the conductivity of α-Fe2O3 along the (110) direction is four orders of magnitude greater than in the orthogonal direction.40
In order to further identify its physicochemical characteristics, Raman and XPS tests were performed on a representative α-Fe2O3 film (deposited for 30 s, annealed at 500 °C for 2 h). The Raman spectra shown in Fig. 4(A) exhibit the characteristic peaks of α-Fe2O3 at 212, 271, 384, 484, 579 and 1282 cm−1.52 Unlike some earlier reports,36,53 the peak located at approximately 650 cm−1, which was assigned to magnetite (Fe3O4) or a disordered phase (possibly induced by the presence of FeO), was almost negligible, indicating that the film contained α-Fe2O3 of high purity. The XPS spectra of the α-Fe2O3 film shown in Fig. 4(B) indicated the presence of iron (Fe), oxygen (O) and carbon (C). The existence of C could be attributed to an impurity introduced during sample preparation, or possibly to absorption of CO2 from the air. Fig. 4(C) shows the Fe 2p core-level spectra, with Fe 2p3/2 lines at a binding energy of 710.8 and 724.1 eV. The binding energy of the Fe 2p3/2 line was typical of α-Fe2O3, and clearly different from the corresponding values for Fe3O4 (709 eV) or FeO (709.1–709.5 eV).15,54 A characteristic satellite peak of α-Fe2O3 also appeared at 718.8 eV.55 These results confirmed that α-Fe2O3 thin films could be synthesized at high purity by a route involving the electrodeposition of a Fe film in an electrolyte with ammonia, followed by thermal oxidation in air.

A typical SEM image of the Fe film is shown in ESI Fig. S3,† and it can be seen that the Fe film consisted of nanoparticles and its surface was relatively smooth. Fig. 5 shows SEM micrographs of α-Fe2O3 films (500 °C for 2 h) prepared from Fe films obtained for different deposition times, and Fig. 6 illustrates the corresponding cross-sectional SEM images. After annealing in air, the nanoparticle-like Fe films were transformed into compact α-Fe2O3 films, especially in the case of the sample with 5 min deposition (Fig. 5(A)). The α-Fe2O3 film of the samples deposited for 30, 45 and 60 s had similar surface morphology, showing a compact film with some nanoparticles on the surface (Fig. 5(B)–(D)). All the α-Fe2O3 films prepared were well adhered to the FTO substrate, and the thickness of the film was linearly dependent on the deposition time (Fig. 6 and ESI Fig. S4†).

α-Fe2O3 is an n-type semiconductor with band gap ∼2.1 eV, which means that it can absorb light of wavelength below 590 nm. This is verified by the UV-vis absorption spectra of α-Fe2O3 films illustrated in Fig. 7. With an increase in annealing temperature from 400 to 600 °C, the absorption intensity gradually increased up to 700 °C, at which the intensity then decreased in the region 320–500 nm and became lower than that of the sample annealed at 500 °C (Fig. 7(A)). When annealed at 500 °C for 0.5 h, the absorption intensity in the region 320–480 nm was lower than that of the sample annealed for 2 h, whereas it was higher in the region 480–720 nm (Fig. 7(B)). When the annealing time was increased to 4 h, the absorption intensity was lower in the region 320–450 nm than that of the sample annealed for 2 h. With a further increase in annealing time to 6 h, the absorption intensity was lower in the region 320–550 nm compared to that of the sample annealed for 4 h.

According to the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 3, it can be concluded that a stronger (110) peak of α-Fe2O3 would increase the absorption intensity in the response region, and the (104) peak would further increase the absorption intensity up to the appearance of the (012) peak. After that the absorption intensity would decrease, with an increase in the intensity of the (104) peak. This result indicates that the light absorption intensity of α-Fe2O3 film was related to the crystallinity and lattice orientation of the film.
3.2 Photoelectrocatalytic characterization
The PEC water-splitting activity of the α-Fe2O3 films was studied in a three-electrode PEC cell to observe the response of PEC water oxidation in 1 M KOH under simulated solar light irradiation (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5). The potentials were measured relative to the SCE reference electrode and converted to the RHE scale, according to eqn (1): ERHE = ESCE + 0.0591 × pH + E0SCE,(1)where ERHE is the calculated potential vs. RHE, ESCE is the measured potential, pH is about 13.9 and E0SCE is approximately 0.2415 V at 25 °C. The photocurrent densities measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE of the α-Fe2O3 films annealed for 2 h at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 8(A).
 Fig. 8  Photocurrent density of α-Fe2O3 film (deposited over 30 s) annealed at (A) different temperatures for 2 h, and (B) 500 °C for various durations, measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH electrolyte under AM 1.5 illumination. 
The α-Fe2O3 film annealed at 500 °C showed the highest photocurrent density of 1.35 mA cm−2, whereas the film annealed at 300 °C showed the lowest photocurrent, possibly because insufficient crystallization of the film led to a higher density of defects and lower conductivity. The α-Fe2O3 film annealed at 600 °C showed lower photocurrent than that of the sample annealed at 500 °C, which could be attributed to the rapid increase in resistance of the FTO film (ESI Fig. S5†). An increased resistance could also explain the decrease in the photocurrent of the sample annealed at 700 °C. Moreover, the decreased absorption intensity in the region 320–500 nm of the sample annealed at 700 °C would also account for the decrease in photocurrent.

Fig. 8(B) shows the photocurrent densities of α-Fe2O3 films annealed at 500 °C for different times. The sample annealed for 0.5 h showed the lowest photocurrent (0.8 mA cm−2), while the highest photocurrent (1.35 mA cm−2) was obtained for the sample annealed for 2 h. When the annealing time was further increased, the photocurrent decreased slightly. According to the XRD patterns (Fig. 3) and the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 7), the α-Fe2O3 film showing the strongest (110) peak in the XRD patterns (the α-Fe2O3 films annealed at 500 °C for 2 h vs. 400 °C for 2 h or 500 °C for 0.5 h) should have had substantially improved photocurrent density. However, the samples with the (012) peak (the α-Fe2O3 films annealed at 500 °C for 4 h or 6 h, or 700 °C for 2 h) showed a relatively small photocurrent density. This interesting result could be due to the superior conductivity of α-Fe2O3 along the (110) direction compared with that in the orthogonal direction, as mentioned earlier.

Fig. 9 shows the chopped photocurrent–potential (I–V) curves of the α-Fe2O3 films for different deposition times (annealed at 500 °C for 2 h). Clearly, among the four samples under test the sample with a deposition time of 30 s showed the highest photocurrent response. However, a further increase in deposition time reduced the PEC water oxidation performance. For example, the sample at 60 s showed the lowest photocurrent response. As mentioned earlier, α-Fe2O3 is an indirect band gap semiconductor with a very short lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers (<10 ps) and a short hole diffusion length (2–4 nm).24 Although the increase in film thickness would improve the light absorption by generating more photocharges, it would also increase the recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and decrease the efficiency of charge transfer. This means that the benefit of improved light absorption would be offset by a rapidly increasing recombination rate, especially in very thick films. Hence, a suitable thickness of α-Fe2O3 film is crucial for both light absorption and charge transfer in PEC applications. In the present study the optimum sample (30 s) contained an α-Fe2O3 film with a thickness of 230 nm (ESI Fig. S4†).

Cobalt phosphate (Co–Pi) is an effective co-catalyst that can improve the water oxidation kinetics on the photoanode surface in PEC water splitting.33,56,57 In order to improve the performance of the prepared α-Fe2O3 film in PEC water splitting, Co–Pi decorated α-Fe2O3 films (Co–Pi/α-Fe2O3) with different PED times were prepared. The EDX result of the Co–Pi/α-Fe2O3 film prepared with Co–Pi deposited over 600 s is shown in ESI Fig. S6† and confirmed that the Co–Pi had been applied uniformly. The I–V curves of the Co–Pi/α-Fe2O3 films deposited at different PED times are shown in Fig. 10(A), and it can be seen that the application of Co–Pi on the α-Fe2O3 film reduced the onset potential of the photoanode for water splitting, both under illumination and in the dark, which means Co–Pi could facilitate the water oxidation reaction taking place at the Fe2O3 electrolyte. After deposition of Co–Pi for 300 s, the photocurrent response of the sample increased significantly, from 1.35 to 1.72 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. When the PED time was further increased to 600 s, the photocurrent response increased slightly, with a photocurrent of 1.89 mA cm−2. On the other hand, after 1200 s PED the photocurrent response fell to 1.53 mA cm−2. As can be seen from the Nyquist plots of these samples shown in Fig. 10(B), Co–Pi can decrease the resistance of the α-Fe2O3 films in PEC water splitting, and the lowest resistance of the Co–Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanode occurred at 600 s. However, a thicker Co–Pi layer, as in the case of 1200 s Co–Pi/α-Fe2O3, would increase the resistance of the Co–Pi layer itself and finally reduce its charge transfer properties. In these circumstances, 600 s was thus the optimum time for deposition of Co–Pi on the α-Fe2O3 film.

The measurements were carried out in 1 M KOH electrolyte under AM 1.5 illumination. 
The stability of the photoanode in PEC water splitting is crucial in both fundamental and practical studies. Fig. 11(A) shows the photocurrent curves of optimized α-Fe2O3 and the Co–Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanodes measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH electrolyte under AM 1.5 illumination for 2 h. The photocurrent of the two photoanodes after 600 s deposition were 1.34 and 1.85 mA cm−2, respectively, without any significant decline, indicating that both photoanodes exhibited excellent stability in PEC water splitting. For quantitative investigation of the photoactivity of the α-Fe2O3 films as a function of wavelength, the IPCE was measured for the two photoanodes at 1.23 V vs. RHE, and the result is shown in Fig. 11(B). The IPCE behaviour of both photoanodes was observed between 350 and 570 nm, roughly consistent with the light absorption spectrum of the α-Fe2O3 film (Fig. 7). This indicated that the photons absorbed at different energies had been successfully converted to photocurrent. The IPCE values of the Co–Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanode were higher than those of the bare α-Fe2O3 photoanode in the full response region, which meant that the decoration of the Co–Pi co-catalyst made the conversion to current of absorbed photons at different energies more effectively. The IPCE values in the short wavelength region (<380 nm) were up to 22% for the Co–Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanode, much higher than those for the reported α-Fe2O3 film prepared via anodic or cathodic electrodeposition.

It will further be noted that a common characteristic of the α-Fe2O3 photoanode was that the IPCE curve decreased more rapidly in the region 380–450 nm compared with the absorption spectrum (see Fig. 7). This is due to the fact that the photons in this region only excite the indirect d → d transition of Fe3+, which generates electron–hole pairs localized in Fe3+ and cannot provide sufficient energy for water oxidation.23,58,59
The PEC activity of the optimized α-Fe2O3 film was also investigated experimentally by organic compound degradation. The PEC (at a bias potential of 0.6 V vs. SCE), photocatalytic (PC; PEC without bias potential), and direct photolytic (DP) degradation of MB in neutral aqueous solution were respectively performed under the conditions indicated. Fig. 12(A) shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of MB solution after PEC reaction on the α-Fe2O3 film for different times. The characteristic peak of MB at 665 nm was found to decrease steadily with reaction time. As shown in Fig. 12(B), the performance of the α-Fe2O3 film in different systems was in the order PEC > PC > DP. The highest rate constant was 0.9372 h−1 obtained by PEC, which is 5.06 or 9.12 times greater than that for PC (0.1851 h−1) or DP (0.1028 h−1), respectively. This suggests that the presence of α-Fe2O3 film could improve the degradation efficiency of MB, particularly under a positive bias, for improved separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the α-Fe2O3 film. Since the kinetic constant of the PC reaction was only 1.8 times higher than that of the DP reaction, this also confirmed the poor transport properties of photogenerated charges in α-Fe2O3 film without a positive bias.

The reuse of the α-Fe2O3 film for the PEC degradation of MB in three PEC cycles is shown in Fig. 12(D) and further indicates that the α-Fe2O3 film was stable for PEC applications, including the degradation of organic compounds.
3.3 IMPS measurements
In order to illustrate the lesser microstructure defects in the α-Fe2O3 films prepared in this study, IMPS was applied to measure the charge carrier transit times (τd) in the α-Fe2O3 films prepared in the study and the anodic α-Fe2O3 films prepared by traditional anodic electrodeposition.28 IMPS is a powerful, non-destructive technique for characterization of the photo-generated carrier transportation and recombination/relaxation information in the photoelectrode.60–62 The average time of photogenerated charges needed to reach the back contact, the transit time τd, can be estimated from eqn (2): τd = (2πfmin(IMPS))−1,(2)where fmin is the frequency at the minimal value in the IMPS plot.60 The transit time reflects the recombination probability of photogenerated electrons and holes in the photoelectrode, which is always related to the microstructure of the photoelectrode film.62
The XRD patterns shown in ESI Fig. S8† indicated that the annealed film consisted of α-Fe2O3, as has previously been reported in the literature.28 The SEM images shown in ESI Fig. S9† indicated that the FeOOH film deposited and the anodic α-Fe2O3 film were uniform, and the thickness of the anodic α-Fe2O3 film was 410 nm. For comparison, the α-Fe2O3 film with a deposition time of 60 s whose thickness was also 410 nm (ESI Fig. S4†) was selected for the IMPS test; this film was denoted 60 s/α-Fe2O3.

Fig. 13 shows IMPS plots of the anodic α-Fe2O3 film and the 60 s/α-Fe2O3 film. According to the fmin, the calculated transit time (τd) values of the anodic α-Fe2O3 film and the 60 s/α-Fe2O3 film were 3.004 and 1.197 ms, respectively. The τd of the anodic α-Fe2O3 film was almost three times that of the 60 s/α-Fe2O3 film, demonstrating that the photogenerated charges more readily reached the back contact in the 60 s/α-Fe2O3 film than in the anodic α-Fe2O3 film. Since the nanostructured defects in the photoelectrode film can generate a large number of crystal boundaries, which impede the transportation of charges and promote the recombination of photogenerated electron–holes,62 the IMPS result indicated that the α-Fe2O3 film prepared in the present study should possess fewer nanostructural defects in comparison with the anodic α-Fe2O3 film prepared by traditional electrodeposition.

4. Conclusions
A convenient method has been developed for the preparation of photocorrosion-stable and highly photoactive α-Fe2O3 films. Ammonia in the electrolyte was crucial for obtaining a uniform Fe film by electrodeposition, and the Fe film was completely transformed to α-Fe2O3 film by in situ thermal oxidation. The optimized α-Fe2O3 photoanode showed a stable PEC water oxidation current of 1.35 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 irradiation. After decoration with a Co–Pi co-catalyst, the optimized Co–Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanode showed IPCE above 18% at 400 nm with a stable photocurrent of 1.89 mA cm−2 for PEC water splitting. The α-Fe2O3 photoanode also demonstrated excellent stability and degradation efficiency (rate constant 0.9372 h−1) for the PEC degradation of MB in neutral aqueous solution. This study provides a useful insight into the design and preparation of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes for cost-effective and highly effective PEC applications.
