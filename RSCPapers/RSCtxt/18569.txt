    , Accepted 23rd November 2018First published on 23rd November 2018AbstractHigh-performance fiber-shaped energy storage devices (FESDs) based on Ni–Fe batteries are indispensable for the development of portable and wearable electronics. Construction of highly capacitive pseudocapacitance cathode/anode materials holds great potential for the fabrication of high-performance FESDs. In this study, CoP@Ni(OH)2 nanowire arrays (NWAs) with hierarchical core–shell heterostructure, directly grown on carbon nanotube fiber (CNTF), are prepared by a facile and environmentally friendly hydrothermal method, followed by phosphorization and chemical bath deposition process. CoP NWAs possess excellent electrical conductivity, and the core material and secondarily grown substrate can provide fast charge transfer and reaction kinetics between electrolyte and pseudocapacitance material. 3D spindle-like α-Fe2O3 (S-α-Fe2O3) architecture is well-dispersed and directly grown on CNTF via solvothermal method and post-annealing process. An FESD consisting of a CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF as the positive electrode, a S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF as the negative electrode, and KOH-PVA as the gel electrolyte is fabricated. The FESD achieves a maximum capacity of 0.203 mA h cm−2 and highest energy density of 81.0 mW h cm−3, which are mainly attributable to the uniquely hierarchical core–shell and spindle-like nanostructure. Furthermore, the device shows a high power density of 12000 mW cm−3 and a long cycle life with 85.3% retention after 3000 cycles at the current density of 30 mA cm−2.
Introduction
Academic and industry communities have transferred their focus to reproducible and continuously renewable energy resources, mainly because of the rapid consumption and negative environmental influences of fossil fuels.1–9 As reasonable choices, solar cells, fuel cells, secondary rechargeable batteries, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), and supercapacitors provide enormous potential as energy conversion and storage devices.10–16 Safety concerns associated with non-aqueous LIBs and toxic Pb-acid and Ni–Cd batteries cannot be neglected owing to their use of highly toxic and combustible organic electrolytes.17–19 Aqueous rechargeable batteries based on Ni-metal, such as Ni–Fe, Ni–Bi, and Ni–Zn batteries, have attracted significant attention as substitutive forms of energy storage owing to their highly safe performance, high ionic conductivity, insignificant environmental issues, and low cost.1,4,5,7–9,20–22 However, the shortage and high price of Bi restrict its practical application.1,21,22 The dendritic crystal formation and morphological damage, occurring on Zn anodes during the charge–discharge process, negatively affect the maintenance of battery capacity.8,23 For example, Zong et al. reported that a hybrid zinc-battery with robust electrochemical performance was assembled using NiCo2O4 NWAs, grown on carbon-coated nickel foam (NiCo2O4/NiF@C) as the cathode, a zinc plate as the anode and 6 M KOH containing 0.2 M Zn(OAc)2·6H2O as aqueous electrolyte. However, application of alkaline aqueous electrolyte in as-mentioned hybrid zinc-battery does not make it a sufficiently safe energy-storage device. Furthermore, the weak flexibility of NiCo2O4/NiF@C cathode and zinc plate anode restrict its practical application in portable and wearable electronics.24 Compared with Ni–Bi and Ni–Zn batteries, Ni–Fe batteries have received much attention, because the anode materials for this battery type are mainly iron oxides containing Fe2O3 and Fe3O4. These oxides are considered promising candidates because they are nontoxic, highly corrosion resistant, abundant, and inexpensive.5,7,20,23,25 However, with the rapidly growing demand for the miniaturization of portable and wearable electronics, it is necessary to fabricate energy storage devices with high energy density and tiny volume.26–36 Fiber-shaped energy storage devices (FESDs) are the primary choice to meet the requirements of miniaturization.31,37,38 To the best of our knowledge, FESDs based on Ni–Fe batteries have not been reported until now. On this basis, the selection of cathode and anode materials with high capacitance and electrical conductivity, directly grown on a conductive fibrous current collector (binder-free), appears to be particularly important for constructing high-performance FESDs.20,23,33 However, the low specific capacitance of the single-component Ni-based cathode materials has seriously restricted their practical application.5,20 Moreover, conventional Fe-based materials have low specific capacitance and inferior rate capability.23,39 Current advances in novel core–shell nanostructured cathode materials and, in particular, three-dimensional (3D) anode materials have empowered researchers to restudy Ni–Fe batteries.
Transition metal phosphides such as CoP, Co2P, and NiP2 have been extensively investigated as novel cathode materials for ESDs owing to their high electrical conductivity and high redox chemical valences in comparison with other transition metal oxides, such as CoO, NiO, and Co3O4.18,40–44 Specifically, Co phosphides have been considered as potential promising low-cost competitive cathode materials for ESDs because of their high conductivity and stability.40,42,44 Furthermore, the smaller band gap of Co phosphides indicates higher conductivity than that of single-component oxides or even corresponding ternary Co–Ni oxides.40,44,45 Additionally, single-metal phosphides show great promise in the construction of next-generation electrodes with increased specific capacitance resulting from their high electronic conductivity. However, further increasing the capacitance of binary CoP is still a tremendous obstacle. One prospective approach is to construct a hierarchical core–shell heterostructure with highly-conductive Co phosphides as the core and well-known pseudocapacitive transitional metal hydroxides as the shell layer.33,36,46 In a recent study of the establishment of the core–shell structure, the authors claimed that it is expected to provide optimized electrochemical performance for ESDs.
Numerous investigations have been undertaken of anode materials, suitable for constructing nanostructured Fe2O3 materials with different morphological features to overcome the aforementioned issues.20,23,36,47 For example, Shen and co-workers reported that Fe2O3 nanorods, grown on graphene foam/carbon nanotube hybrid films, showed good electrochemical performance.20 Wang et al. synthesized hierarchical Fe2O3 hollow spheres as lithium ion battery anode materials.47 Therefore, constructing Fe2O3 with a unique 3D morphology is a proven and effective method, utilized in building of high-performance Ni–Fe batteries.
To this end, we are focused on developing an electrode architecture that can offer coinstantaneous improvements in specific energy and power density, applicable to high-performance FESDs. We have prepared 3D well-aligned CoP nanowire arrays (NWAs)@Ni(OH)2 nanosheets (NSs) with hierarchical core–shell heterostructure and 3D α-Fe2O3 with a spindle-like nanostructure (S-α-Fe2O3), grown directly on carbon nanotube fibers (CNTFs: diameter of about 120 μm) for use as binder-free positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Additionally, we have successfully fabricated a high-performance FESD based on a Ni–Fe battery, using the aforementioned positive and negative electrodes and KOH-PVA as gel electrolyte that achieved a high energy density of 81.0 mW h cm−3 at 1200 mW cm−3. Furthermore, the developed FESD can be cycled up to 3000 cycles with only 14.7% attenuation of capacity. This work provides a promising strategy for effectively constructing FESDs based on nanocomposites, which may smooth the way to developing high-performance, wearable, low-cost, portable, and safe energy storage technologies.
Experimental
Preparation of CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF
The CoP NWAs on a CNTF was synthesized by using a simple hydrothermal method and, subsequently, by phosphating. Before growing all samples on the CNTFs, the CNTFs were pretreated with O2 plasma at a power of 150 W for 8 min. Firstly, typically, 1.66 g mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.42 g NH4F, and 1.71 g CO(NH2)2 were dissolved in 40 mL deionized (DI) water and stirred vigorously to form an uniform solution. The CNTFs were immersed in the solution, which was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Then the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 120 °C for 6 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the CNTFs with grown sample on their surface were washed repeatedly using DI water and dried for 12 h at 60 °C, forming the Co–O/CNTF precursors. Thereafter, they were phosphatized at 350 °C in Ar for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 (0.1 g NaH2PO2·H2O as bonderite), the CoP NWAs/CNTF was obtained, and the mass loading of the CoP NWAs was measured to be 0.97 mg cm−2. The synthesized CoP NWAs/CNTFs were suspended into a homogeneous solution containing 10 g Ni(SO4)2·6H2O, 2 g K2S2O8, 5 mL of aqueous ammonia (28%), and 100 mL DI water for 30 min. Finally, the positive electrode material CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF was washed repeatedly using DI water several times and dried at 60 °C for 10 h in a vacuum (mass loading: 1.24 mg cm−2). The Co3O4 NWAs/CNTFs were also prepared by annealing the Co–O/CNTF precursor at 420 °C in Ar for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 (mass loading: 0.93 mg cm−2). Furthermore, the Co3O4@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF was prepared by the same method for comparison (mass loading: 1.23 mg cm−2).
Preparation of S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF
The S-α-Fe2O3 grown on a CNTF was fabricated by using a facile hydrothermal method and a post annealing treatment. 4.05 g FeCl3·6H2O and 1.66 g C8H6O4 were dissolved in 100 mL DMF and stirred vigorously to form a uniform solution. The CNTFs were immersed into the solution which was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Then the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 100 °C for 14 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the CNTFs with grown sample were washed repeatedly using DI water and dried for 12 h at 60 °C, forming the Fe–O/CNTFs precursors. Then, they were subsequently annealed at 350 °C in air for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1, and the S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF (mass loading: 0.78 mg cm−2) was obtained.
Assembly of CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF//S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF FESDs
The as-assembled FESDs were constructed using hierarchically-structured CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF as a positive electrode, S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF as a negative electrode, and KOH-PVA as gel electrolyte. The solid gel electrolyte was prepared by blending 11.2 g KOH and 10 g PVA in 100 mL DI water with intense stirring at 95 °C for 2 h until the solution turned clear. Thereafter, both CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF and S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF electrodes were immersed into the KOH-PVA gel electrolyte for 10 min and subsequently dried at 60 °C for 2 h twice. Finally, all-solid-state FESDs were triumphantly assembled by twisting the two electrodes together and dried at 60 °C for 12 h until the KOH-PVA gel electrolyte cured fully.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the process of preparation of CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs with hierarchical core–shell heterostructure and S-α-Fe2O3 directly on CNTFs to construct the high-performance FESD. For the positive electrode, CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs were directly grown on a CNTF via three processes, consisting of hydrothermal synthesis, phosphorization in argon, and chemical bath deposition. For the negative electrode, S-α-Fe2O3 was directly grown on a CNTF via a two-step process, which included hydrothermal synthesis and annealing in air. The FESD was assembled by twisting the two electrodes together with a gel electrolyte coating. CoP exhibits many excellent characteristics, such as high electrical conductivity, electrochemical activity, and chemical stability.40,41,45 α-Fe2O3 with a spindle-like nanostructure also possesses many remarkable properties, such as high specific surface area and negative potential.20,23 In present study, the CoP NWAs, grown on the CNTFs, not only act as electrically conductive and stable supports for the growth of the nanostructured metal hydroxide that acts as the cathode, but also promote ultrafast charge transfer and ion diffusion. S-α-Fe2O3 that serves as the anode, directly grown on the CNTFs, demonstrates prominent electrochemical performance. Therefore, the FESD assembled by these two electrodes can provide good technical support for the next generation of portable and wearable electronics.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the fabrication of the cathode and anode materials and the fiber-shaped Ni–Fe battery. 
Facile and environmentally friendly hydrothermal phosphorization and chemical bath deposition processes were used to prepare CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs, because these processes form a CoP@Ni(OH)2 composite active material with a hierarchical core–shell heterostructure. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image in Fig. 2(a) reveals that the Co–O precursor NWAs was uniformly grown on the entire CNTF. The amplified SEM image in Fig. 2(b) clearly shows that the Co–O precursor is well-distributed and highly aligned in the hybrid CNTF. Fig. 2(c) shows the SEM image of the CoP NWAs with its morphology remaining in perfect condition after phosphorization of the Co–O NWAs precursor, indicating that the effect of the phosphorization on morphology can essentially be ignored. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of the as-prepared CoP NWAs also displayed the same results and element distribution (Fig. S1†). The morphology of the Co–O NWAs precursor after high-temperature calcination still remains intact, as shown in Fig. S2.† The TEM measurement of the as-synthesized Co3O4 NWAs likewise shows similar results and element distribution (Fig. S3†). Fig. 2(d) clearly shows that the ultrathin Ni(OH)2 NSs were uniformly anchored on the surface of the CoP NWAs after chemical bath deposition, forming homogeneous and unique 3D hierarchical core–shell heterostructures. Nevertheless, although the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets can be homogeneously attached on the surface of the Co3O4 NWAs to form a similar structure, the aligned core–shell structures suffer a degree of destruction (Fig. S4†). TEM was used to further observe the microstructure of the as-prepared CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs, and a representative core–shell nanostructure is displayed in Fig. 2(e). A high-resolution TEM image in Fig. 2(f) shows interplanar spacing of 0.257 nm, which is consistent with the (012) planes of α-Ni(OH)2. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings in Fig. 2(g) indicate that the Co and P elements come from within the nanowire, whereas the Ni and O elements are uniformly distributed within the outside coatings, further confirming a typically hierarchical core–shell heterostructure. Additionally, TEM imaging of the Co3O4@Ni(OH)2 NWAs also confirmed a similar structure, as shown in Fig. S5.† The chemical compositions of the core and shell were confirmed by an X-ray diffraction (XRD) method, and the results prove that they are recognized as orthorhombic CoP NWAs (JCPDS card no. 29-0497)42 and rhombohedral α-Ni(OH)2 nanosheets (JCPDS card no. 38-0715),20 respectively (Fig. 2(h)). The XRD pattern of the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs includes the major diffraction peaks of both the CoP NWAs and Ni(OH)2 NSs with no other superfluous peaks, indicating that the fabricated core–shell heterostructures consist solely of CoP and α-Ni(OH)2. Fig. S6† shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs cathode material. The BET surface area of the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs is estimated to be 133.7 m2 g−1. Additionally, the XRD patterns of the Co3O4 and Co3O4@Ni(OH)2 NWAs are shown in Fig. S7.† X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed on the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs to analyze the surface elemental composition and chemical valence states of different elements. The survey spectrum inserted in Fig. 2(l) indicates that the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF sample consists of Co, P, Ni, O, and C, in which the element C comes from the substrate CNTF and amorphous carbon, derived from the annealing process. Therefore, Co, P, Ni, and O are the main chemical elements in the near surface of the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF samples. Fig. 2(i)–(l) display the typical Co 2p, P 2p, Ni 2p, and O 1s narrow scan of the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF sample. The Co 2p1/2 region shows two peaks at 797.7 and 794.3 eV, and the Co 2p3/2 region shows two peaks at 781.9 and 778.6 eV (Fig. 2(i)). Meanwhile, two satellite (denoted as Sat.) lines associated with Co 2p are also present. As shown in Fig. 2(j), the P 2p region displays two peaks at 130.3 and 129.5 eV, representing the binding energies of P 2p1/2 and P 2p3/2, respectively, along with one peak at 133.8 eV.40,48 The peaks at 778.6 and 129.5 eV trend towards the binding energies for Co and P in CoP.45,48 Two typical peaks centered at 873.0 and 855.6 eV are observed in Fig. 2(k) and are in accordance with Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 of Ni(OH)2, respectively.3,20 Moreover, two Sat. lines in connection with Ni 2p also appear. In the O 1s region (Fig. 2(l)), binding energies at 531.2 eV are identified as OH groups. The plot for C 1s is shown in Fig. S8.† These data further confirm the hierarchical nanostructure and composition of the CoP core/Ni(OH)2 shell.

With regard to the anode material S-α-Fe2O3, the as-synthesized Fe–O precursor was also homogeneously grown on the CNTF after the hydrothermal process (Fig. 3(a)) and showed an octahedral-like structure (Fig. 3(b)). Additionally, the chemical composition of the Fe–O precursor was proved by XRD measurement to be FeO(OH), as shown in Fig. S9.† Subsequent to the annealing treatment, the Fe2O3 showed a spindle-like morphology (Fig. 3(c)). TEM was also used to further prove the spindle-like morphology of the as-fabricated S-α-Fe2O3 (Fig. 3(d)), with the high-magnification image in Fig. 3(e) showing the lattice fringes with 0.294 nm spacing, corresponding to the (116) plane of S-α-Fe2O3. TEM mapping results showed that the elementary compositions of S-α-Fe2O3 contain Fe and O elements (Fig. 3(g)). Moreover, diffraction peaks at 24.1°, 33.2°, 35.6°, 40.9°, 49.5°, 54.1°, 57.6°, 62.4°, 64° and 71.9° can be respectively indexed to the (012), (104), (110), (113), (024), (116), (018), (214), (300) and (1010) phases of standard hexagonal Fe2O3 (JCPDS card no. 33-0664) (Fig. 3(f)).23 Fig. S10† shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of the S-α-Fe2O3 electrode material. The BET surface area of the S-α-Fe2O3 is estimated to be 116.5 m2 g−1. The XPS result in Fig. 3(h) shows a typical Fe 2p spectrum of S-α-Fe2O3 with the two peaks located at 724.6 and 711.0 eV corresponding to Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2, respectively. Meanwhile, the Sat. line connected with Fe 2p at 719.0 eV further certifies the S-α-Fe2O3 phase rather than Fe3O4.20 The O 1s region shows two peaks, centered at 532.5 and 530.4 eV (Fig. 3(i)) that represent C–O and Fe–O, respectively. The aforementioned results indicate that the as-synthesized product was indeed S-α-Fe2O3, directly grown on CNTF as the negative electrode.

Fig. 4 shows the electrochemical performance characteristics of the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF in 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. As is known, to acquire remarkable rate capability and specific capacitance of electrode materials with a hierarchical core–shell nanostructure, the core needs superior electrical conductivity, and the shell layer must have outstanding pseudocapacitance characteristics.33 Co3O4 NWAs/CNTF electrode suffers from low electrical conductivity and low rate capability, as shown in Fig. S11,† further weakening the rate capability of the hierarchical Co3O4@Ni(OH)2 NWAs core–shell nanostructure/CNTF electrode (Fig. S12†). To overcome this limitation, we phosphatized the Co3O4 NWAs to transform them into CoP NWAs, which resulted in preferable conductivity and rate capability (Fig. S13†). Comparison of the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves of Co3O4@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF and CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrodes at current densities of 2 and 20 mA cm−2 reveals a drastically longer discharge time for the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode (Fig. 4(a) and (b)), signifying notably larger capacitance for this electrode. In addition, the IR drop in the GCD curve at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 for the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode is as low as 2.5 mV, which can be basically ignored. However, the IR drop for the Co3O4@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode reaches 23.7 mV (Fig. 4(a)). When the current density increases 10-fold (20 mA cm−2), the IR drop for the Co3O4@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode is as high as 249.4 mV, while that for the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode is only 24.5 mV (Fig. 4(b)), indicating that CoP NWAs can effectively decrease the IR drop and enhance electrochemical capacitance of the core–shell-like electrode. The typical CV curves of the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode are displayed at various sweep rates ranging from 1 to 10 mV s−1 (Fig. 4c). Fig. 4(d) shows the relationship between log(i) vs. log(v) from 1 to 10 mV s−1 for the cathodic and anodic peaks. Assuming that the measured current i obeys a power law relationship with the scan rate v, according to the equation i = avb, where a and b are adjustable parameters, b can be determined from the slope of the plot log(i) vs. log(v).49,50 On the basis of the approximations, b = 1 corresponds to surface-controlled current, whereas b = 0.5 indicates current, controlled by the semi-infinite linear diffusion. The slope of the lines in Fig. 4(d) is calculated to be ≈ 0.80, indicating that the charge storage process is synergistically controlled by the capacitive and diffusion behaviors, further empowering the high rate performance. Fig. 4(e) shows the typical GCD curves of the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode at different current densities (from 2 to 20 mA cm−2) over the voltage window of 0–0.4 V. The nearly symmetric and nonlinear pattern, associated with the GCD curves, further confirms the existence of faradic redox reactions that suggest strong pseudocapacitive behavior of the active materials. As we expected, the capacity of the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode was as high as 0.689 mA h cm−2 at a current density of 2 mA cm−2, and an impressive capacity of 0.495 mA h cm−2 can be maintained even at a high current density of 20 mA cm−2, signifying that 71.8% of the capacity can be maintained with a 10-fold increase in current density from 2 to 20 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4(f)). This value is far higher than that for the Co3O4@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF (24.2%), indicating excellent electrochemical performance of the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs. To understand the superiority of the electrochemical performance of the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode in comparison with that of the Co3O4@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were carried out. As shown in the Nyquist plots (Fig. 4(g)), the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode displays a dramatically smaller semicircle (related to the charge-transfer resistance, Rct) compared to the Co3O4@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode, confirming the increased efficiency of the electrochemical reaction occurring in the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode. The lower equivalent series resistance Rs is 4.4 Ω for the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode but is 26.5 Ω for the Co3O4@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode. Moreover, when compared with the Co3O4@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode, the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode has a lower diffusion resistance owing to its more ideal straight line in the low-frequency region. Thereby, the low electrical resistance and the IR drop, and fast charge transfer contribute to the large capacitance and good rate capability of the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode. To investigate the cycling life of the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF and Co3O4@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrodes, GCD measurements were repeated over 15000 cycles at 20 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4(h)). The first and last GCD curves for both electrodes after 15000 cycles are displayed in Fig. S14.† Significantly, the capacity of the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode after 15000 cycles remained at 85.4%, whereas that for the Co3O4@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode remained at 59.7%. The extraordinary properties of the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF electrode make it a promising candidate for use in the construction of future flexible energy-storage devices.

Fig. 5 displays the electrochemical performance characteristics of the as-synthesized S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF anode. The representative CV curves of the S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF electrode are displayed at various sweep rates ranging from 5 to 50 mV s−1 (Fig. 5(a)). It is worth noting that a pair of redox peaks can be clearly seen, indicating typical battery-type electrochemical behavior. As the scan rate increases, the positions of the oxidation and reduction peaks shift accordingly in more anodic and cathodic directions, respectively, showing the kinetic irreversibility resulting from polarization and ohmic resistance during the faradaic process. According to the relationship between log(i) vs. log(v) mentioned above, the slope of the lines is calculated to be ≈ 0.79 (Fig. 5(b)), showing that the charge storage process is synergistically controlled by the capacitive and diffusion behaviors, further highlighting the high rate performance. In Fig. 5(c), the nonlinear and almost symmetric GCD curves of the S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF electrode reflect improved pseudocapacitive performance and faradaic reversibility. The capacity of the S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF electrode is as high as 0.474 mA h cm−2 at a current density of 2 mA cm−2, and 0.335 mA h cm−2 at a high current density of 20 mA cm−2, indicating an excellent rate capability. The superiority of the electrochemical performance of the S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF electrode was also demonstrated by the results of the EIS study, as shown in Fig. 5(e). From the Nyquist plots, it can be clearly seen that the S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF electrode shows a small semicircle, signifying the high efficiency of the electrochemical reaction of the S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF electrode. As well, the equivalent series resistance of the S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF electrode is 3.29 Ω. Meanwhile, the electrode shows a low diffusion resistance as a result of its ideal straight line in the low-frequency region. These results further verify the outstanding electrochemical performance of the S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF electrode and are in excellent agreement with the aforementioned results. The cycling performance of the S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF electrode was also investigated by repeating 6000 cycles of the GCD test at 20 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5(f)), with the first and last GCD curves for the S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF electrode after 6000 cycles, displayed in Fig. S15.† Of note, the capacity of the S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF electrode after 6000 cycles still remained at 76.8%, revealing remarkable cycling life. The prominent performance of the S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF as the negative electrode makes it a promising candidate for use in construction of future fiber-shaped portable energy-storage devices.

To confirm suitable operation of the as-prepared electrodes in fully functional devices, we assembled solid-state FESDs using the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF as the positive electrode, the S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF as the negative electrode, and KOH-PVA gel electrolyte. The optical image of the as-assembled FESD is shown in Fig. S16.† The as-assembled FESDs can rein in the operating voltage window of CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF (0–0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF (−1.2–0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) to attain a high voltage of 1.6 V (Fig. 6(a)). CV curves at various scan rates (Fig. 6(b)) show that the FESDs can successfully work at 1.6 V with representative pseudocapacitive features. The nonlinear and nearly symmetric GCD curves (Fig. 6(c)) reveal a battery-type electrochemical characteristic and great reversibility with high coulombic efficiency for the FESDs. The capacity of the FESD is as high as 0.203 mA h cm−2 at a current density of 3 mA cm−2, and the capacitance still maintains 0.128 mA h cm−2 (63.1%) at a high current density of 30 mA cm−2, indicating admirable rate capability. As shown in Fig. 6(e), the high energy density of 81.0 mW h cm−3 is achieved at a power density of 1200 mW cm−3, and the energy density remains at 51.1 mW h cm−3 even at a high power density of 12000 mW cm−3. The areal energy and power densities of the FESD are shown in Fig. S17.† Those values considerably exceed previously reported flexible ESDs, such as ZNCO@Ni(OH)2//VN@C (33.66 mW h cm−3),33 NiO//Fe3O4 (5.2 mW h cm−3),5 Fe3O4–C//CNT (1.56 mW h cm−3),51 H–TiO2@MnO2//H–TiO2@C (0.3 mW h cm−3),52 TiO2//Fe2N (0.61 mW h cm−3),53 MnO2/PEPOT:PSS//ordered microporous carbon (11.3 mW h cm−3),54 MnO2//Fe2O3@C (0.85 mW h cm−3),55 MnO2//MWNT (11.7 mW h cm−3),34 Ni@Ni–Co–S//rGO-CNTs (18.4 mW h cm−3),56 and NiPx//Ni@rGO (8.97 mW h cm−3),57 further confirming the excellent electrochemical performance of our as-assembled FESDs. Furthermore, the FESDs maintained 85.3% of their initial capacitance after long-term charge/discharge cycling at 30 mA cm−2 for 3000 cycles (Fig. 6(f)), and the shape of inserted GCD profiles for the last 10 cycles is maintained well in comparison with that of the first 10 cycles, indicating excellent cycling stability. More importantly, the mechanical flexibility of the as-assembled FESDs is particularly important for their potentially practical application in the fields of portable and wearable electronics. As shown in Fig. 6(g), there are very small changes in the GCD curves of the device at a current density of 6 mA cm−2 and different bending angles from 0° to 180°, confirming the prominent mechanical flexibility of our FESDs. Additionally, after 3000 cycles of bending from 0° to 90°, the specific capacitance still remained at 92.4% (Fig. S18†), further ascertaining the sturdy mechanical flexibility of our FESDs. Additionally, the corresponding comparison of the EIS data is shown in Fig. S19,† again illustrating strong mechanical stability performance of the FESDs. Six red light emitting diode (LED, 1.8–2.2 V) indicators, connected in parallel, were lit up by two FESDs, under normal circumstances connected in series, as shown in Fig. 6(h). Fig. 6(i) shows that the two devices can be used to light the LED indicators even at an 180° bending angle, and the brightness remains almost unchanged in comparison with the normal condition in Fig. 6(h). These practical applications further confirm that the FESDs can act as energy-storage devices and show strong, flexible mechanical performance. These results confirm the success of our strategy to fabricate flexible high-power energy-storage devices for integration into wearable electronic devices.

Conclusions
In this study, through rational design, we developed a facile and environmentally friendly method to fabricate novel well-aligned hierarchical CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs core–shell heterostructures and spindle-like α-Fe2O3 grown on CNTF surfaces as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The CoP NWAs not only serve as a stable conductive support but also provide fast and efficient pathways for electrons, whereas the nanosized ultrathin Ni(OH)2 NSs largely shorten the diffusion paths and enable fast ion transport that results in high rate performance and long-term stability. Owing to the increased electrical conductivity of the CoP core material and the synergistic effects of the well-aligned CoP NWAs and Ni(OH)2 NSs, the capacity of the CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF is as high as 0.689 mA h cm−2. The S-α-Fe2O3 with ultrahigh specific surface area, directly grown on the CNTF, shows a high capacity of 0.474 mA h cm−2. We also assembled solid-state FESDs with the as-fabricated electrodes and a KOH-PVA gel electrolyte that successfully show an operating voltage of 1.6 V and deliver high capacity of 0.203 mA h cm−2, energy density of 81.0 mW h cm−3, and rate performance of 63.1%. More importantly, the as-assembled devices display an outstanding cycling property and strong, flexible mechanical performance. Therefore, the hierarchical core–shell heterostructure CoP@Ni(OH)2 NWAs/CNTF as the positive electrode and S-α-Fe2O3/CNTF as the negative electrode in the assembled FESDs show great potential for application in portable and wearable energy storage devices.
