    , Accepted 5th November 2017First published on 6th November 2017AbstractBarium disilicide (BaSi2), composed of abundant and inexpensive elements, is a potential absorber material for thin-film solar cells. In this study, density-functional theory calculations show that BaSi2 belongs to a Zintl phase with a mixed character of covalent units of tetrahedral Si4 with an ionic nature described by (2Ba2+)(Si4)4−. The molecular orbital diagram is elucidated based on the electronic structures, suggesting that the charge transfer transition from Si p to Ba d greatly enhances optical absorption. A large photoabsorption coefficient is confirmed using advanced excited state calculations that include excitonic effects. The ionization potential of BaSi2 is smaller than that of silicon or germanium, suggesting that the band edge positions are suitable for p-type conductivity and type II heterojunctions for BaSi2/Si or BaSi2/Ge. The chemical potential window for the stable growth of a stoichiometric BaSi2 film is very narrow, and the stability of native defects is investigated under realistic growth conditions. Si vacancy, Ba substituted for Si antisite, and Si interstitial defects are predominant but do not cause the generation of a significant number of carriers. The calculated Fermi level is pinned in the middle of the band gap for the entire silicon chemical potential range and a wide growth temperature range, indicating the feasibility of bipolar doping, which is advantageous for fabricating p–n junctions.
Introduction
The world primary energy demand is projected to grow to ∼26 TW (19643 million tonnes of oil equivalent) by 2040, which is almost a 54% increase from the current energy demand of 12.7 TW.1 To meet this future energy demand, the utilization of solar energy has been proposed as one of the most promising approaches among renewable energy resources (hydro, geo-thermal, and wind energy).2 Photovoltaic (PV) cells or solar cells are the technology used to convert solar energy into electrical energy.
Among the various types of solar cells that have been developed, thin film PVs are the most viable technology, revolutionizing the problems faced with the present Si-based solar cells.3,4 Although silicon is an earth abundant element, the amount of silicon required in a c-Si cell to compensate for its low photoabsorption cross-section is very high. Moreover, high processing temperatures are needed due to silicon's high melting point of 1414 °C, and high purity is required because of its low tolerance to defects, which can adversely affect the cell performance. Thus, more efficient photoabsorbers such as compound semiconductors Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS), CdTe (CT), and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) have been used as the active layers of thin-film solar cells. Record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 22.6%,5 22.1%,6 and 12.6% (ref. 7) have been achieved for CIGS, CT, and CZTSSe, respectively. However, the toxicity of the heavy-metal Cd in CT, the rising cost and scarcity of In, Ga, and Te in both CIGS and CT, and the polymorphism and unavoidable antisite disordering (due to defects such as copper-on-zinc and zinc-on-copper) that limits further efficiency improvement are of great concern in these materials, limiting the development of future clean and efficient PV technologies.8–10
Alternative compounds consisting of abundant, inexpensive, and eco-friendly elements have been considered to meet the requirements of next-generation clean energy technologies. In particular, researchers have considered the possibilities of alternative binary and ternary materials consisting of inexpensive and abundant elements such as BaSi2,11 FeS2,12 Fe2S,13 SnS,14 Cu2O,15 Cu2S,16 Sb2S3,17 ZnSnN2,18 Cu2SnS3,19 Cu3BiS3,20 CuSbS2,21 CuSbSe2,22,23 and CuTaN2 (ref. 24) for thin-film solar cells. However, due to various scientific and engineering challenges, very few systems have been demonstrated as prototype PV devices.
Barium disilicide (BaSi2) has been suggested as a promising candidate for solar cell applications and has received great attention recently.25–29 Apart from a suitable band gap (1.25 eV), the optical activity is very strong in this material, and it has been shown that the absorption coefficient of BaSi2 is roughly eighty times larger than that of c-Si and two to four times larger than that of conventional absorbers such as CT, CIGS, and CZTSSe.30 Thin films of BaSi2 have been grown on Si or Ge substrates (111) mostly by using the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique to achieve high crystallinity. In addition, other deposition techniques based on sputtering and vacuum evaporation have also been used as low cost methods.31–35 Moreover, the large quantum efficiencies (>70%), long minority-carrier life time (10 μs), and long minority-carrier diffusion length (10 μm) are promising properties adding to the advantages of BaSi2.31–35 In fact, a conversion efficiency of 9.9% has been reported for the first prototype p-BaSi2/n-Si heterojunction solar cell.36
Understanding the fundamental physical properties such as band edge energies, absorption coefficients, and band offsets, along with the thermodynamic stability and formation mechanism of dominant intrinsic point defects in the absorber material is crucial for designing an efficient thin-film solar cell. However, few systematic studies have been performed on the defect properties of BaSi2.37,38 The sources of the carriers and the dominant native defects in BaSi2 are still unclear. First-principles density functional theory (DFT) plays an important role in providing deep insights into the defect properties of semiconducting materials.39 Therefore, in this paper, we present our systematic study of the electronic properties, optical properties, and defect physics of BaSi2 from first-principles calculations. The optical properties are studied by solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) in terms of the two-particle Green's function, i.e., quasi-electron and quasi-hole states. With the knowledge of structural and electronic properties, the molecular orbital (MO) diagram of BaSi2 is proposed. Our study on the native defects of BaSi2 reveals that none of the native defects cause the generation of a significant number of carriers. In fact, the Fermi level is pinned in the middle of the band gap, indicating high potential for bipolar doping. We demonstrate that external doping is effective for shifting the Fermi level and realizing bipolar conductivity. We further show that bipolar doping can be easily achieved in BaSi2, making it a potential material for fabricating p–n homojunctions.
Computational details
The electronic structure calculations are performed using a unit cell configuration (24 atoms), while the defect properties are determined using a 192-atom (2 × 2 × 2) supercell configuration. All calculations are performed using the plane-wave projector augmented-wave (PAW) method as implemented in the VASP code within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE).40–42 The lattice constants were relaxed by minimizing the total energy to an accuracy of 0.1 meV, and the atomic positions were relaxed by minimizing the forces on each atom to an accuracy of 0.01 eV Å−1. An energy cutoff of 400 eV was applied in all cases, and a 3 × 4 × 2 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh was employed for convergence. The ion positions are relaxed until the forces on each of the ions are less than 0.03 eV Å−1. A plane-wave cutoff of 400 eV and a Γ-centered k-point mesh of 2 × 2 × 2 are used in the defect calculations. The image charge correction proposed by Makov and Payne (ref. 43) was applied to charge defects. The valence band maximum (VBM) corrected for defective systems by aligning the averaged electrostatic potential far away from the defect sites.39 For the band gap calculation, additional methods such as the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) screened hybrid functional (ref. 44) and quasi-particle (GW)45 were used. Among various GW approximations, we used partially self-consistent GW (scGW0) in which the Green's function ‘G’ is updated iteratively, whereas the screened Coulomb potential ‘W’ was kept fixed. A PBE wave function was used for GW calculation. Optical properties are calculated with a combination of the GW and BSE scheme.46
The ionization potential (IP) of the materials commonly estimates from two different computational results for the slab model and the bulk system (unit cell).47,48 The IP is a physical quantity providing the energy difference between the vacuum level and the VBM for a considered material: IP = ϵVac-Ref − ϵVBM-Ref(1)where ϵVac-Ref is the energy difference between the electrostatic potential in the vacuum region and the peak position of the deep semi-core state in the bulk-like mid-layer of a slab, while ϵVBM-Ref is the energy difference between the VBM and the peak position of the deep semi-core state from bulk calculation (unit cell configuration of the material). In the present study, Ba-5s state was used for the deep semi-core state. Electron affinity is usually computed by subtracting GW band gap from the IP. However, for minimizing computational errors caused by different VBM positions in PBE and GW, we have applied an additional correction scheme as discussed in the band offsets section. For the slab model, three main surfaces (100, 010, and 001) of BaSi2 are constructed in such a way that Si4 tetrahedra and BaSi2 stoichiometry remain invariant. Thus, there are no dangling bonds associated with silicon in our models. A total 120 atom slab model considering eight layers of BaSi2 and a vacuum layer of 20 Å is considered. For silicon and germanium, we selected the (111) surface because it is the preferred orientation commonly used as a substrate for growing silicide thin films.11,25–28 We followed the standard procedure and relaxed the top and bottom surfaces with the mid layer fixed by using a 7 × 7 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh for convergence. Furthermore, the surface energy (γ) was computed using the formula (2)where Eslab is the total energy of the slab, Ebulk is the total energy of the bulk per unit cell, n is the number of bulk unit cells contained in the slab, and A is the surface area of each side of the slab.
The total energies of the defects are calculated using a supercell. For defect D in the charge state q, the formation energy ΔH(Dq) is expressed as39 ΔH(Dq) = Etot(Dq) − Etot(bulk) − ∑Δniμi + q(Ev + EF + ΔV),(3)where Etot(Dq) and Etot(bulk) are the total energies of the BaSi2 supercell with and without defect D, respectively, and EF is the Fermi energy of the system measured from the VBM. Moreover, Δni is the number of atoms of species i (i = Ba or Si) that are removed from (Δni < 0) and/or added to (Δni > 0) the supercell to create the defect. Finally, μi is the corresponding chemical potential referenced to the standard elemental state, i.e., μi = μ0i + Δμi, where the reference potentials μ0i are those of metallic Ba and the solid state of Si.
Based on the computed ΔH(Dq), the concentration of charge defects c(Dq) is estimated using the following formula:39 (4)where Nsite is the number of possible lattice sites per supercell in which the defect can be formed, Vcell is the cell volume, kB is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Finally, the thermodynamically equilibrium hole (nh) and electron (ne) concentrations can be expressed as49 (5) (6)where mh and me are the effective mass of holes and electrons, respectively, while EF and Eg are the estimated Fermi and band gap energy, respectively. We used our calculated values of 0.42 for me and 0.57 for mh, which are consistent with the reported averaged effective masses (0.41 and 0.53 for me and mh, respectively).50 Our effective masses were estimated from parabolic fitting of the band edges. The pinned Fermi level EF is determined to satisfy charge neutrality conditions51 (7)for given chemical potential conditions.
Results and discussion
Structural analysis and molecular orbital diagram of BaSi2
BaSi2 is a member of the Zintl phase group (ref. 52), which crystalizes in a BaSi2-type structure (orthorhombic, space group: no. 62, Z = 8).53 Even though the crystal structure of this compound has been previously discussed, detailed analysis of this structure with quantum mechanical calculations has not been performed. Such analysis is essential for understanding the detailed structure of BaSi2, which has a unique Si atom motif, namely the Si tetrahedron (Si4). Fig. 1 highlights the structural analysis of BaSi2. In a conventional unit cell of BaSi2 (Fig. 1a), eight Ba atoms occupy two inequivalent 4c Wyckoff sites whereas 16 Si atoms occupy three inequivalent positions at 4c and 8d Wyckoff sites. The main structural feature of BaSi2 is the Si4 unit (Fig. 1b), where each Si atom is covalently bonded with three neighboring Si atoms. This behavior can be confirmed by charge density analysis. Fig. 1c shows the contour plot of the charge density along the (100) plane from the highest electron density of 0.02 electrons per Å3 (red) to the lowest electron density of 0.002 electrons per Å3 (green). This isolated Si4 tetrahedron can be attributed to the typical Zintl phase of BaSi2. According to the Zintl–Klemm concept,52 Ba atoms supply their valence electrons to Si atoms, and the Si atom with an excess valence electron forms covalent bonds with the adjacent three Si atoms, satisfying the octet (8-N) rule. This situation can be expressed with the chemical formula [2Ba]4+[Si4]4−.

(b) Each Si atom in the Si4 tetrahedral unit has three-fold coordination with neighboring Si atoms with an average bond length of 2.41 Å and lone pairs. (c) The contour 2D plot of the charge density along the (100) plane. 
Due to the number of inequivalent positions, the local chemical environment in BaSi2 is different at each site, making this compound complicated to understand, especially when considering the influence of this local chemical environment on the electronic properties. Therefore, we perform additional analysis with Born-effective charge (Z*) calculations (ref. 54) to understand the bonding characteristics of BaSi2. Our analysis (Table S1, ESI†) shows that there is a large variation in Z* (∼30 to 47% for Ba atoms, and ∼11 to 80% for Si atoms) compared to their nominal static charges of Ba (+2) and Si (−1), respectively. This analysis confirms the charge transfer in BaSi2 and the covalent (within the Si4 tetrahedral unit) and ionic bonding (within BaSi2).
To understand the MO of BaSi2, we perform a combined analysis of the orbital decomposed density of states (DOS), charge density, and crystal orbital overlap population (COOP). Fig. 2a shows the DOS for BaSi2, which can be divided into six regions with respect to the energy range, such as −13 to −12 eV, −11 to −10 eV, −6 to −5 eV, −3 to −2, −2.2 to the VBM, and the conduction band minimum (CBM) to 4 eV for parts I, II, III, IV, V, and VI respectively. Pronounced peaks appear in regions I and II, which correspond to Ba p- and Si s-like states, respectively, while peak III consists of Ba p- and Si sp-states. The valance band region (parts IV and V) is composed of Si p-like and Ba pd-like states. On the other hand, the conduction band region (part VI) is mainly derived from the Ba d- and Si p-like states. To understand the character of bonding/anti-bonding or non-bonding in BaSi2, we perform additional orbital decomposed DOS (Fig. S1a†) COOP (Fig. S1b†), as shown in the ESI.† Fig. S1b† shows the calculated COOP for different bonds such as Ba–Si, Ba–Ba, and Si–Si, where positive, negative, and zero values along the y-axis indicate bonding, antibonding, and non-bonding interactions, respectively. The aforementioned six regions can be identified with the same energy range. We further confirmed these chemical bonds with partial charge density analysis, where each part of the respective region is shown in Fig. 2b. Here, each DOS peak in BaSi2 has been analyzed using charge density analysis. Based on the combined analysis of Born-effective charges, COOP, DOS, and charge density, we elucidated the molecular orbital diagram of BaSi2 for the first time (as shown in Fig. 2c), starting from the bonding nature in a [Si4]4− unit. Because the Si atom with an excess valence electron is isovalent to P atoms, we deduce the MO diagram of the [Si4]4− unit from that of the P4 tetrahedron. The MOs in a Group 15 based tetramer with a regular tetrahedral shape (Td-symmetry) have been extensively investigated [ref. 55 and references therein]. Thus, the P4 tetrahedron with Td-symmetry has five occupied MOs: the 1a1 and 1t2 MOs predominantly formed from the 3s orbital, and the 2a1, 2t2, and 1e MOs predominantly formed from the 3p orbitals. The P4 tetrahedron also has unoccupied MOs such as the 1t1 and 3t2 MOs. We think that a similar situation is also realized in the [Si4]4− unit. (The Si–Si COOP analysis shows that states above 0 eV are anti-bonding states, which is consistent with the fact that the 1e and 1t1 orbitals are bonding and anti-bonding states.) The MO diagram of BaSi2 consists of the energy diagram of [Si4]4− and [2Ba]4+. The valence band of BaSi2 is composed of the MO states of [Si4]4−, that is, 1a1, 1t2, 2a1, 2t2, and 1e MO states, while the conduction band is composed of Ba 5d and Ba 6s states, as well as [Si4]4− 1t1 and 3t2 MO states.

Electronic and optical properties within the GW + BSE formalism
The calculated electronic band structure of BaSi2 is shown in Fig. 3a. Here, we present the orbital decomposed band structure near the band edges. The width of red and blue lines represents the contribution of Si p and Ba d orbitals, respectively. The VBM is composed of Si p-like states, whereas the CBM is composed of Ba d-like states, which is also observed in the charge density plots at the VBM and CBM, respectively, in Fig. 3b. Our HSE06-estimated indirect band gap is 1.25 eV, whereas the smallest direct gap is 1.37 eV. The small difference between the indirect and the direct gap (∼0.12 eV) contributes to strong photoabsorption as shown below. On the other hand, the quasi-particle approach (scGW0) yields a fundamental band gap energy of 1.28 eV.

(b) The square of the wave function (yellow surface) corresponding to the VBM and CBM with an isosurface at 0.005 e Å−3. (c) Average absorption coefficient (see Fig. S2† to observe in each crystallographic direction) of BaSi2 calculated with independent particle (PBE functional (blue line)), self-energy interaction (GW (red line)), and the inclusion of e–h Coulomb interaction (GW + BSE (black line)). Inset (i) shows the imaginary part of the dielectric function, while inset (ii) shows the close up of absorption spectra. 
Thus, both computational methods estimate a similar band gap, which is in good agreement with the measured experimental band gap value of 1.3 eV.35 Table S2 (ESI†) shows the calculated energy gaps at various high symmetry points of the Brillion zone (BZ). Because BaSi2 has several local maxima and minima in the valence and conduction bands, respectively, several direct band gaps exist in the small energy region above Eg. This is plausibly the reason why BaSi2 has a large optical absorption coefficient. However, high photoabsorption does not necessarily deteriorate the carrier mobility. In fact, we found that the averaged effective masses of electrons  and holes  in BaSi2 are slightly smaller than those of Si .56
The standard DFT calculation is known to fail in describing the properties of light absorption. However, the GW approximation and BSE scheme include the e–e correlation and e–h interaction, respectively, and hence, the combination of GW and BSE can frequently give results that match with experimental results. Therefore, the optical properties of BaSi2 are discussed using first-principles many-body perturbation theory by solving BSE in terms of the two-particle Green's function for the quasi-electron and quasi-hole states following the method described in our earlier studies.57 The imaginary part of the dielectric function and absorption spectrum are depicted in Fig. 3c. In comparison with the spectra at the independent-particle level (PBE), self-energy effects (GW) generally blue shift the absorption edge. However, when considering e–h interactions (GW + BSE), the spectrum is slightly red shifted due to the exciton effects. We observed three new absorption peaks at 1.48 eV, 1.65 eV, and 1.95 eV (see inset (ii) in Fig. 3c) immediately above the onset of absorption (1.28 eV) by considering e–h interactions. An apparent 150 meV red shift of the prominent absorption peak at 2.82 eV (see inset (i) imaginary part) is observed with the use of e–h interactions.
Band offsets of BaSi2 with Si and Ge
Band alignment is related to the conductive properties of the semiconductor, describing whether the semiconductor is likely to become n-type or p-type; if the VBM is higher, it is likely to become p-type.58 Therefore, this section can be considered a prologue to the full investigation of the conductive properties induced by native defects in the following section. The IP and electron affinity determine the valence band and conduction band offsets between the different materials that control the barriers for carrier transport at heterojunctions in electronic devices and photovoltaic cells. In the present study, the band offsets of BaSi2 with respect to a potential substrate material, i.e., silicon and germanium, are studied. The results are summarized in Fig. 4. Our estimated ionization potentials of Si (4.95 eV) and Ge (4.68 eV) are in good agreement with the previously reported PBE/DFT data.59 Note that PBE usually underestimates the ionization potential by up to 0.3 eV compared to HSE or GW due to the self-interaction error.59 Therefore, we used a new methodology discussed elsewhere60–63 to estimate the IP. It shows that the band gap center (BGC) is less affected by the band gap correction than the VBM. Thus, a more accurate reference for band calculations is EBGC instead of the conventional EVBM and ECBM. Here, one can subsequently determine these band edges by subtracting or adding half of the fundamental band gap (Eg) calculated with GW/HSE methods.
 Fig. 4  Band alignment based on the calculated ionization potential (IP). Three surface orientations (100, 010, and 001) are used for BaSi2, while only one orientation (111) is used for Si and Ge. Note that IP corresponds to the negative of the valence band maximum with respect to the vacuum level. 
Our computational results for the IP of BaSi2 are 4.58 eV, 4.64 eV, and 4.59 eV for the (100), (010), and (001) orientations, respectively. There is no comprehensive study for describing the work function of pristine BaSi2 in the literature, while the work function of n-type and p-type samples of BaSi2 was reported to be 3.20 eV (ref. 64) and 4.56 eV (ref. 26), respectively. However, detailed experimental studies on the effects of surface orientation on the work function are lacking. It appears from Fig. 4 that all the BaSi2/Si(111) interfaces form type-II heterostructures which explains the recently observed high conversion efficiency of p-BaSi2/n-Si heterojunction solar cells.65
We also estimated the surface energy and found that (010) is more stable than (100) and (001) surfaces as estimated surface energies are in the order of 0.472 J m−2, 0.476 J m−2, and 0.518 J m−2, respectively. The relaxed structure of all three surfaces is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†).
Intrinsic defect properties and external doping
First, we study six native point defects, i.e., silicon vacancies (VSi), barium vacancies (VBa), silicon substituted for barium antisites (SiBa), barium substituted for silicon antisites (BaSi), silicon interstitials (Sii), and barium interstitials (Bai). For Sii and Bai, we adopted a previously reported interstitial site28 as an initial configuration and fully relaxed the local geometry. The VBa and VSi are created on Ba(I) and Si(I) sites, respectively (see details about various inequivalent positions in Section 1 Born-effective charges in the ESI†). The vacancies are created on these sites because the formation energy was lower (∼0.1 eV) on these sites compared to other inequivalent sites for the respective atom. Moreover, the same sites are also considered for the antisite defects of BaSi and SiBa. The local geometries of some stable defects are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†).
To guarantee the stable growth of stoichiometric BaSi2, the formation of other competing phases, such as BaSi, Ba2Si, Ba3Si4 and Ba5Si3, must be avoided. Such growth conditions are described by a set of equality and inequality expressions of barium and silicon chemical potentials, as addressed in the ESI.† The allowed chemical potential results in the domain −1.07 eV < ΔμBa < −0.71 eV and −0.19 eV < ΔμSi < 0 eV referenced to elemental phases for Ba and Si, respectively (Fig. S5, ESI†). The chemical potential range for the stable growth of BaSi2 is relatively narrow, indicating that the growth conditions must be carefully optimized to synthesize the stoichiometric BaSi2 phase. Fig. 5a and b show the calculated formation energies for the predominant charge states of these native defects under Si-rich (Ba-poor) and Si-poor (Ba-rich) conditions, respectively. The defect that gives the lower formation energy is considered to be stable, yielding a significant concentration in the compound. The slope of each line indicates the charge state q, and a kink on each line indicates the thermodynamic transition level (q/q′) at which the predominant charge state is changed from q to q′.
 Fig. 5  Calculated formation energies as a function of the Fermi energy of the intrinsic point defects in BaSi2 under (a) Si-rich and (b) Si-poor conditions. The vertical dashed lines mark the estimated equilibrium Fermi level at T = 600 °C. (c) Calculated intrinsic carrier concentrations (inset shows the Fermi level variation under both Si-rich and Si-poor conditions) with increasing growth temperature under the Si-poor conditions. (d) Defect density (NT) of dominant defects at a growth temperature of 600 °C. 
The vacancy VSi was found to give the lowest formation energy among the considered defects in a wide range of Fermi energy conditions under both Si-poor and Si-rich conditions. It is rather surprising to see that VSi is predominant even under the Si-rich conditions. This behavior can be understood from the fact that the removal of a silicon atom does not cost much energy in BaSi2 due to the self-compensation of dangling bonds among the three silicon atoms left in the tetrahedron. In addition, VSi is positively and negatively ionized under lower and higher Fermi energy conditions, respectively, indicating that VSi can act as both a donor and an acceptor depending on the Fermi energy. The Sii and BaSi defects are relatively stable defects in BaSi2. However, they become charge neutral in a wide range of Fermi energies at the middle of the band gap and are thus not capable of generating carriers. Based on the above analysis, BaSi2 is inactive for electronic conductivity without external doping similar to intrinsic semiconductors. To validate the above speculation, we have estimated a pinned Fermi level, equilibrium defect concentration (NT), and carrier concentrations based on charge neutrality conditions.51 The vertical dashed lines in Fig. 5a and b mark the equilibrium Fermi level at T = 600 °C, while Fig. 5c shows the calculated electron and hole concentrations with growth temperature under Si-poor conditions. The calculated electron carrier density of n ∼ 1016–1017 cm−3 is in good agreement with the measured electron carrier density of n ∼ 1016 cm−3. Hence, our computational findings agree with various experimental measurements (ref. 27, 28 and 31–35) where undoped BaSi2 shows very weak n-type conductivity with electrons as the majority carriers. Moreover, it is also observed that, at low growth temperature (∼300 °C), the electron and hole carrier concentrations are comparable. Thus, it would not be surprising if both p-type and n-type conductivities were experimentally observed in undoped BaSi2 samples. This behavior was indeed observed in a recent experimental measurement when Sasaki et al. (ref. 26) measured holes to be the majority carriers with p ∼ 8.6 × 1017 cm−3 in a BaSi2 film. It was also said that BaSi2 and other silicide semiconductors can change to the p- or n-type depending on their deposition conditions, composition ratio, and impurities.26 The inset in Fig. 5c shows the estimated Fermi level variation under both Si-rich and Si-poor conditions. The Si-poor conditions led to an increase in the Fermi level even though the difference is marginal. Fig. 5d shows the calculated defect concentrations (NT) as a function of the Si chemical potential for predominant defects V+Si, Si0i, and Ba0Si at a growth temperature of 600 °C. The calculated equilibrium defect concentration of NT ∼ 1015−1016 cm−3 agrees with the measured value of NT ∼ 1015 cm−3.37
Multiple thermodynamic transition levels are observed in the band gap (see Fig. S6, ESI†). In particular, there are three transition levels for VSi, possibly due to the fact that various numbers of electrons can be accommodated at the defect site. The three dangling bonds created at the VSi site are stabilized either by forming new Si–Si bonds among the three silicon atoms or by forming lone pairs with extra electrons added in the system. These transition levels may be correlated with deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements to understand the nature of the trap levels. In a recent DLTS measurement (ref. 37), two majority-carrier (electron) trap levels, located at about 0.1 and 0.2 eV below the CBM, were detected in the n-type BaSi2 layer. It is also observed from Fig. S6† that VSi gives rise to Kohn–Sham levels located in the band gap (see the DOS plots of VSi in Fig. S7a.†). However, by looking at the DOS near the band edge region of the supercell with V_Si, we found that the Si character predominates at the defect level than the Ba character. Since the CBM of BaSi2 is composed of Ba d-like states, free electrons in the conduction band are unlikely to encounter the silicon vacancy states. Hence, this might suppress the electron traps in BaSi2. For a comparison, we also studied a similar compound FeS2, which is known as an absorber material for solar cells. Here, we prepared a supercell of anion vacancy (V_S) similar to the case of BaSi2 for analysis. We found that unlike BaSi2, cation character (Fe in this case) predominates at the defect level as well as CBM.66 Since they have the same character, electrons at the CBM are likely to be trapped at the vacancy site in FeS2. Fig. S7† shows the DOS of BaSi2 and FeS2.
Overall, based on our native defect study, BaSi2 is found to be inactive for conductive properties, although the stable charge defect, V+Si, causes a slight predominance of electron carriers over hole carriers. In fact, we found that the Fermi level is pinned in the middle of the band gap, similar to the case of classical semiconductors such as silicon. Thus, bipolar conductivity is highly expected from external doping. To verify our hypothesis, we studied the role of various external dopants in BaSi2 in the following section.
External doping
An approach to increase electron (hole) carriers is doping BaSi2 with an impurity that provides excess electrons (holes) in its dominant form. In principle, there are two choices for n-type doping in BaSi2: (i) substituting tetravalent Si with a pentavalent element such as N, P, As, or Sb, or (ii) substituting divalent Ba with a trivalent element, such as La and Y. Similarly, there are two choices for obtaining p-type conductivity: (i) substituting Si with a trivalent element such as B, Al, Ga, and In, or (ii) substituting Ba with a monovalent element such as Li, Na, or K. There are few experimental studies investigating the role of external dopants such as B, Al, Ga, In, Cu, and Ag in BaSi2,28,38,67 and theoretical studies are limited. Although some calculations were previously performed using a unit cell (24 atoms) to investigate the effects of atomic substitution for foreign elements,68,69 such models tend to represent solid solutions or alloys instead of doped BaSi2.
In our present study, we choose eight external dopants (Li, K, Al, Ga, N, Sb, Y and La) and investigate their capability of shifting the Fermi level. We used the same supercell configuration of 192 atoms (2 × 2 × 2) as that used for the native defect calculation. The reference chemical potential of all external dopants is derived either from metallic elemental phases (Li, K, Al, Ga, and Sb) or from the molecular phase (N2). See Table S3 in the ESI† for the DFT-estimated chemical potentials of various dopants. In general, the chemical potential of a dopant should be estimated from its limiting phase which is subject to an upper bound. For La and Y, we adopted silicide phases LaSi2 and YSi2, while for Li, K, Al, Ga and Sb, elemental phases were used since these choices yield smaller chemical potentials for these dopants. We considered all possible sites for all dopants and found that Li and N atoms prefer to occupy the interstitial site rather than the substitutional Ba or Si site, whereas all other dopants prefer substitutional sites. See Fig. S8(a–c) in the ESI† for the calculated formation energy of all dopants. One can see that the formation energy of KBa, AlSi, GaSi, and SbSi is very low compared to their corresponding interstitial defects. On the other hand, the formation energy is high for LiBa and NSi compared to their corresponding interstitial defects. Based on the charge neutrality conditions, we estimated the Fermi level and carrier density of various selected dopants as depicted in Fig. 6. The Fermi level was shifted accordingly for various dopants as shown in Fig. 6a. Similarly, the electron carrier density is enhanced with Li and Sb doping (solid lines in Fig. 6b), but not much with La and Y (Fig. S9†), whereas K, Al, and Ga doping improves the hole carrier density to some extent (dotted lines in Fig. 6b). Overall, our results show that both n- and p-type conductivity can be achieved up to an order of ∼1019 and 1018 cm−3 with external doping, respectively. The estimated defect concentration for these external dopants is shown in Table S4.†

The intrinsic electron and hole concentrations are nearly identical (see Fig. 5c) and are shown as a thick solid black line in (b). 
Conclusions
Based on the present theoretical study, we suggest that BaSi2 has great potential as a low cost, earth-abundant photoabsorber material. From our advanced computational method taking into account exciton effects, small absorption peak structures were identified near the threshold along with a very high optical absorption due to multiple direct transitions at different k-points with the energy of photons near the fundamental band gap. The ionization potential of BaSi2 is smaller than that of Si or Ge, suggesting that either a type-II or a type-III heterojunction is formed at BaSi2/Si and BaSi2/Ge interfaces depending on its surface orientation. Furthermore, our DFT supercell calculations for native defects revealed that silicon vacancy, antisite BaSi and Si interstitial defects are the predominant defects but none of them causes the generation of a significant number of carriers in BaSi2. This behaviour is different from many common photoabsorbers like CIGS and CZTSSe, which are intrinsically p-type semiconductors. In fact, the calculated Fermi level is pinned in the middle of the band gap similar to intrinsic semiconductors like silicon. This indicates that bipolar doping is feasible as demonstrated by our detailed study on external dopants in BaSi2, from which Sb and Ga were predicted to be a promising donor and acceptor, respectively. Hence, it is highly expected that BaSi2-based p–n homojunction solar cells can be fabricated once the doping process is established.
