    , Accepted 12th January 2021First published on 12th January 2021AbstractIn this review, we describe the photoelectrochemical (PEC) transformation of atmospheric species such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N2) into useful industrial products on TiO2 and TiO2 composite photoelectrodes. The configuration and classification of PEC cells, and the mechanisms for PEC CO2 and N2 reduction are discussed in detail. Although CO2 and N2 PEC reduction processes are similar to each other with regards to electrode materials, basic working principle and the configuration of the reaction systems, their mechanisms differ significantly. Therefore, various examples of the PEC reduction of CO2 and N2 at TiO2 and titanate-based semiconductor photoelectrodes with different specific cell constructions and reaction mechanisms are introduced and discussed. Despite the significant progress on the PEC reduction of CO2 and N2 at TiO2 based electrodes, some challenges still remain and are outlined. In addition, we propose new approaches to further improve the PEC properties of TiO2 and titanate-based semiconductors for the selective reduction of CO2 and N2 into useful products.
Introduction
Both nitrogen (N2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are abundant gases in the atmosphere, which in principle could be transformed into useful industrial products benefiting the environment and society. In recent years, the excessive utilization of fossil fuels (such as petroleum and natural gas) and raw materials in the chemical industry has produced large amounts of CO2 which has unfortunately worsened environmental issues such as global warming.1–4 Therefore, seeking a green and facile technology to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals with a move towards a carbon neutral society is an ideal solution to the emerging climate crisis. At present, there are several technologies employed for the utilization of CO2, including thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis etc.4–6 Among them, one of the most eco-friendly ways is photocatalysis, which converts CO2 into carbohydrates and oxygen under irradiation via: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light → C6H12O6 + 6O2.7 For example, Xin et al. prepared Ti3+ self-doped brookite TiO2 nanosheets by a facile oxidation-based hydrothermal method to achieve CO2 photocatalytic reduction with simple facilities and low energy costs.8 Furthermore, electrocatalysis has also been used for the conversion of CO2 into a variety of products such as methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), ethanol (C2H5OH), methanol (CH3OH), acetic acid (CH3COOH) or even carbon under appropriate conditions.9–12 For example, Farkhondehfal et al. investigated the reduction of CO2 into syngas using Ag/TiO2 nanotubes as an efficient and inexpensive electrocatalyst.13 This conversion process normally involves multiple electron-proton transfer steps which as a result causes issues with selectivity and therefore will be a key criterion for the large scale industrial conversion of CO2 into useful products.
Ammonia (NH3) is an important raw material for both the chemical industry and the agricultural sector, and has also been identified as one of the most promising carbon-free energy carriers,14,15 in particular as a hydrogen carrier that can be stored and efficiently transported. To date, N2 is predominantly converted to NH3 by the conventional Haber–Bosch process, which is the reaction of N2 with hydrogen (H2) over an iron-based catalyst under high temperature (300–500 °C) and high pressure (150–300 atm).16 This is because N2 molecules are extremely stable due to the strong non-polar NN covalent triple bond, and therefore results in high energy consumption for ammonia synthesis (1–3% of the world's annual energy consumption).17,18 The other reactant, high purity H2 is normally sourced from the steam reforming of natural gas, therefore, industrial ammonia synthesis is responsible for a significant release of the greenhouse gas CO2 due to this process. Due to the above problems, the development of energy-saving and ecofriendly technologies for NH3 production at ambient conditions is highly desirable. Similar to the case of CO2 conversion, the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) can also be achieved via photocatalytic and electrocatalytic processes under mild conditions.19–21 For instance, Zhang et al. reported the synthesis and application of Mo-doped W18O49 ultrathin nanowires as a photocatalyst for nitrogen fixation, which attained an ammonia production rate of 195.5 μmol gcat−1 h−1.21 In addition, Li and his colleagues synthesized amorphous Sn/crystalline SnS2 nanosheets as the electrocatalyst to reduce N2 to NH3 with high activity and selectivity.16 If these processes are powered by renewable electricity, then the NRR process is able to complete the following reaction: N2 + 6H+ + 6e− → 2NH3,22,23 in a completely carbon free process with no environmental impact.
Although photocatalytic and electrocatalytic processes have been extensively used for the conversion of CO2 and N2, they still suffer from limitations. For example, problems such as low solar energy conversion efficiency, poor charge separation and transport capability always restrict the practical application of photocatalytic reactions.9 On the other hand, electrocatalytic processes are generally more efficient for the catalytic reduction of CO2 and N2, however, a large amount of electricity is required and if renewable energy is not exclusively utilized, it will produce detrimental environmental impacts.4 In recent years, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) technique has become increasingly popular in the energy and catalysis fields because it combines the advantages of both photocatalysis and electrochemistry, and could in principle circumvent problems encountered by the individual techniques.24,25 In a PEC process, a light source is used to produce photoexcited electrons/holes with high reduction/oxidation abilities, where an external electrical bias is simultaneously applied to separate electrons/holes and further improve their redox abilities for the potential conversion of CO2 and N2. To realize successful PEC reduction of CO2 and N2, the conduction band (CB) level of the photoelectrode materials should be more negative than the reduction potentials of CO2 and N2, and the valence band (VB) should be more positive than the oxidation potential of water, when referring to the electrochemical energy scale. The above indicates that suitable wide bandgap semiconductors would in principle be ideal photoelectrode materials.8,26
TiO2 and titanate nanostructures have demonstrated excellent performance in both photochemical and PEC fields including applications in catalysis, energy conversion and sensors due to their high photo-electric conversion rate, large specific surface area, low cost, environmental safety and high stability.27–29 In addition, TiO2 and titanate nanostructures can be synthesised as various forms, including one-dimensional nanostructures (wire, rod or tube etc.), two-dimensional nanosheets and three-dimensional nanostructures (sphere, cube or hierarchical structure etc.), which are used for different purposes based on their specific morphologies. More importantly, a suitable bandgap of ∼3.2 eV has enabled TiO2 (titanate) to be one of the most frequently used photoelectrode materials for the PEC reduction of N2 and CO2.8,30 In particular, the photocatalytic and PEC performance of TiO2 (titanate) based materials could be significantly improved by element doping, deposition of co-catalysts, defect engineering (O or N vacancies etc.), or formation of heterojunctions.31 The above modifications would promote charge separation, facilitate absorption of visible light, and increase the adsorption and activation sites of CO2 or N2, thus enhancing the photoelectrocatalytic capacity.32,33 Therefore, all of these features have made TiO2 (titanate) a highly suitable material for the PEC reduction of CO2 and N2.
To summarize the progress made so far and to identify further improvement, several reviews on N2 and CO2 reduction have been published in recent years. For example, Dey et al. presented a review regarding PEC catalytic reduction of CO2 into C1 products using a modified semiconductor-based catalyst system.34 Sangiorgi et al. reviewed recent advances on metal-free carbon-based materials for electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction.35 In addition, Liu et al. summarized the existing limiting factors related to PEC CO2 reduction reaction (PEC CO2RR), which included complex reaction pathways, obstructed mass transfer, and large optical voltage requirements.36 Then, they proposed an ideal wireless system for PEC CO2RR with minimum polarization loss and wide optical absorption. In terms of nitrogen fixation, Yan et al. reported on recent advanced materials developed for electro- and photoelectrocatalysis of ambient N2 fixation.37 Meanwhile, Vu et al. discussed the latest achievements, related methods and fundamental challenges in photo(electro)catalytic nitrogen fixation.23 In this review, the conversion of two of the main components in the atmosphere (CO2 and N2) to useful industrial products is described together due to their significant similarities regarding the electrode materials and the reaction system configuration. This work concentrates on the PEC reduction of both N2 and CO2 on TiO2 (titanate) based nanomaterials, which have already been demonstrated by the cited publications in this review to be highly applicable and promising photoelectrode materials. First, typical PEC systems for N2 and CO2 reduction and their corresponding working mechanisms are introduced in detail. Next, some typical examples of PEC reduction of CO2 and N2 on various TiO2-based nanomaterials are highlighted to demonstrate the promise of this approach. Finally, the existing problems and challenges that have been encountered and the key strategies for improving the PEC reduction of N2 and CO2 on TiO2 materials are discussed.
Configuration of PEC reaction systems
PEC reduction system of CO2
The PEC CO2RR is usually comprised of photoelectrodes, an external power supply, electrolyte, light source (Xe lamp) and a proton-exchange membrane, which allows H+ ions to transfer between the anode and cathode chambers, while preventing the reaction products travelling between the two chambers.35,36,38 In aqueous electrolytes, the poor conductivity of semiconductor electrodes and low CO2 concentration will significantly limit the mass transfer during the CO2RR. In addition, an aqueous solution provides a source of protons for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that is a problematic competition reaction at the cathode. Therefore, to improve reaction efficiency, the products of the CO2RR should be quickly removed from the PEC system to allow subsequent CO2RR reactions to occur with less mass transfer resistance.36
Generally, the PEC CO2RR system can be divided into a photoanode-driven, photocathode-driven, (PN junction)-driven and wireless system.35,38,39 In the first system (Fig. 1A(a)), an n-type semiconductor material is used as the photoanode and a metal electrode as the cathode. The photoelectrons generated on the photoanode can be transported to the cathode by the external bias to drive the CO2 reduction reaction, while the holes oxidize H2O to produce O2 and H+ ions, which will permeate the ion-exchange membrane to the cathode chamber and participate in the CO2 reduction reaction. In the second system (Fig. 1A(b)), a p-type semiconductor material acts as the photocathode and a metal electrode as the anode. In the anode chamber, H2O will be oxidized to O2 and H+, which can selectively transfer across the membrane to the cathode chamber. On the photocathode, CO2 can be reduced by the photogenerated electrons with the aid of the transferred H+ ions. As shown in Fig. 1A(c), the (PN junction)-driven system consists of a p-type semiconductor as the photocathode and an n-type semiconductor as the photoanode. Although the electron–hole pairs produced on the both photoelectrodes recombine easily, this PN junction system is still regarded as the most promising design for large scale PEC CO2 reduction due to the elimination of the external potential source thereby saving energy. In the above traditional PEC cells, external electrical power is still required for mass transfer and separation of photogenerated charges, which will decrease the efficiency of the reaction. Accordingly, wireless PEC systems (Fig. 1A(d)) have been designed to minimize polarization and diffusion losses. In this design, the anode and cathode are combined together with an ion-exchange membrane between the two electrode chambers.36 No matter which system is used, the energy levels of the photoactive materials should satisfy certain requirements for CO2 reduction reactions to proceed.

PEC reduction system of N2
As shown in Fig. 1B, the PEC NRR reduction system consists of photoelectrodes with different configurations, which are nearly identical to those of the PEC CO2RR system. The PEC NRR occurs at the cathode (N2 + 6H+ + 6e− → 2NH3), while oxidation of H2O takes place at the anode. The PEC reaction cell can be either a single chamber cell or an H-cell with two separated chambers. However, NH3 produced at the cathode could in principle be oxidized by the anode in the same single chamber cell, leading to lower NH3 yields. While in an H-cell, the cathode and anode are separated by an ion-exchange membrane, through which H+ generated on the anode can readily pass and facilitate the NRR on the cathode, thereby avoiding the re-oxidation of NH3.40 The photocathode should therefore also be a p-type semiconductor where the conduction band minimum lies below the reduction potential for N2. Thermodynamically this is only slightly more positive than the potential required for water reduction but fortunately the majority of photoelectrodes are poor HER catalysts. Therefore, a high Faradaic efficiency may be expected for photocatalysts that are active for N2 formation thereby reducing the electrical energy input required compared to a purely electrocatalytic driven process. Indeed, this reaction has been studied in the 1970's at Al and p-type GaP electrodes41 and the 1980's at Fe, GaP at TiO2 electrodes,42 where the recent upsurge interest in this approach has been encouraged by the potential use of NH3 as a clean energy carrier.
Reaction mechanisms
Reaction mechanism of PEC CO2RR
By adjusting the applied external bias, the PEC reduction process can transform CO2 into different compounds such as methane (CH4), ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and formic acid (CHOOH) etc. through various reaction mechanisms, accompanied by the production of many intermediates.2,9 In 1978, Halmann first proposed that the mechanism of PEC CO2RR was similar to that of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on metal electrodes.43 Generally, the PEC CO2RR can be classified into C1 (Fig. 2A(a)) and C2 (Fig. 2A(b)) pathways based on the C atom number in the final products. In Fig. 2A(a), the CO2 anion radical (CO2˙−) is formed by the single electron reduction of CO2 in a rate-determining step. After that, the second electron and a water-mediated proton (H+) are obtained by CO2˙− to form HCOO−, and eventually CHOOH. In another reaction pathway, CO as the main intermediate is reduced to formyl (˙CHO) or ˙COH, which then reacts with water-mediated H+ to form C1 hydrocarbons and oxygenates (CH4 and CH3OH).44,45 In Fig. 2A(b), the crucial C–C bond formation reaction is a co-dimerization step mediated by electron transfer to form the ˙C2O2− intermediate, which then undergoes multiple electronation/protonation steps to produce ethylene glycol (CH2OHCH2OH), ethylene (C2H4) and ethanol (CH3CH2OH).46

Although CO2 conversion has been explored through experimental and theoretical methods, the understanding of the reduction mechanism is still challenging. Among the factors affecting the reaction mechanism of CO2RR, the selection of (photo)electrode materials is the decisive one. Specifically, the material composition, surface defects and crystal planes of the catalysts will affect the reduction pathways of CO2. For example, ˙CO intermediates produced in the reduction process (Fig. 2A) can be further reduced to liquid products (e.g. alcohols and aldehydes) on copper-based materials;36 and CO formation on Ag, Au, Zn metals occurs due to weak binding; while HCOOH could be produced from ˙CO intermediates on metals such as Sn, In, Pb, Hg.2,46 Xiong et al. deposited Pt and Cu2O nanoparticles (NPs) on TiO2 with {101} and {001} co-exposed surfaces to obtain a Pt–Cu2O/TiO2 catalyst, which showed high selectivity to CH4 (96.6%) in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.47 In this catalyst, the Pt load significantly promoted the generation of CH4, while Cu2O suppressed the production of H2. Han et al. introduced FeS2 into TiO2 nanotubes to prepare a worm-like FeS2/TiO2 composite, which achieved an excellent methanol yield of 91.7 μmol h−1 L−1 after PEC CO2 reduction.27
In addition, the defects on the surface of electrode materials may also affect the CO2 reduction mechanism. For example, Sun et al. deposited Ag and TiO2 nanoparticles on zeolite TS-1 to obtain a Ag–TiO2/TS-1 composite with abundant Ti3+–VO defects.48 In the process of CO2 conversion, Ag–TiO2/TS-1 not only showed high selectivity for production of CO and CH4, but also inhibited the competitive HER, mainly because of the synergistic effect between highly dispersed Ag nanoparticles, TiO2 with exposed {101} planes and abundant Ti3+–VO defects.
Furthermore, different exposed crystal surfaces of electrode materials may also exhibit diverse effects on CO2 reduction. For example, Truong et al. prepared rutile TiO2 nanocrystals with exposed high-index {331} facets, which exhibited high selectivity to CH3OH (0.569 μmol g−1 h−1) in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction process.49 However, Yu et al. reported that anatase type TiO2 crystals with co-exposure to {001} and {101} surfaces showed high selectivity for CH4 (1.35 μmol g−1 h−1).50
Reaction mechanism of PEC NRR
In general, the reaction pathway of PEC NRR involves two main mechanisms: dissociative and associative mechanisms.51–54 In the dissociation mechanism (Fig. 2B(a)), the NN triple bond is first cleaved before hydrogenation, and then two isolated N atoms are adsorbed on a catalyst surface to independently form NH3 molecules through hydrogenation. This mechanism is similar to the Haber–Bosch process and therefore requires a lot of energy. Alternatively, the intact N2 molecules can be initially adsorbed on the catalyst before hydrogenation in the associative pathway, which can be divided into the alternating (Fig. 2B(b)), the distal (Fig. 2B(c)) and the enzymatic (Fig. 2B(d)) pathways based on the adsorption mode and hydrogenation sequence. In the alternating pathway, H atoms alternately bond with two N atoms on the catalyst surface, and two NH3 molecules are consecutively released. However, this process can potentially form intermediate by-products (such as N2H2 and N2H4), leading to a decrease in NH3 productivity.55,56 While in the distal pathway, the hydrogenation reaction is firstly completed on the N atom farthest away from the catalyst surface to form the first NH3 molecule. Then the second N atom starts to be hydrogenated to produce the second NH3 molecule. For this mechanism, the intermediate by-products (such as N2H2 and N2H4) produced in the alternating pathway are not likely formed during the reaction process.57 In addition, the hydrogenation process in the enzymatic mechanism is similar to that of the alternating pathway, except that the N2 molecules are adsorbed on the active sites of the catalyst surface with a side-on mode, which is different from the end-on adsorption mode in the above mechanisms.
It is worth noting that the association and dissociation mechanisms discussed above are not always dominant because different catalysts may produce different reaction pathways for PEC NRR, and even the same catalyst may show diverse reaction pathways on different crystal faces. For example, Li et al. prepared oxygen vacancy (OV) modified BiOCl as the photocatalyst and found that the specific structures of OVs on various BiOCl facets determines the nitrogen fixation pathway through different adsorption and activation effect of OVs to N2 on the catalyst surface.58 For instance, the OVs on BiOCl {001} facets facilitated NH3 generation via the distal route, while those on BiOCl {010} facets are more inclined to fix nitrogen with the production of the main intermediate N2H4via the alternate route.
Due to the complexity existing in the reaction mechanism of N2 fixation, a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental research is therefore needed to obtain more detailed information about the reaction process and possible intermediates. Furthermore, it is also necessary to design the effective photo(electro)catalysts to reduce the overpotential, suppress the side reaction such as the HER and finally realize N2 reduction based on the expected reaction pathways. The latest design ideas include the defect/strain engineering modification and preparation of heterojunctions with specific morphologies/structures, which will be discussed in Conclusions and perspectives.
PEC reduction of CO2 and N2 at TiO2 (titanate) based photoelectrodes
PEC CO2RR at TiO2 (titanate) based photoelectrodes
To date, some transition metal oxides (TiO2, ZnO and Cu2O etc.) have been widely used as photoelectrode materials in PEC CO2RR.9,26 Among them, TiO2 and titanate composites obtained by various modification methods including formation of heterostructures, metal deposition and doping etc. are the most popular ones.30,44 In the following section, some typical examples of PEC CO2RR at TiO2 composites as the photocathode and photoanode are presented in detail.
Although TiO2 is an n-type semiconductor, it can be used as the photocathode in the PEC reduction process after it has been combined with other p-type photoactive materials to form a heterojunction. For example, Li et al. prepared a TiO2–Au–Cu2O Z-scheme as the photocathode to reduce CO2 (Fig. 3A).26 In this heterostructure, the embedded Au particles functioned as a charge transfer mediator to promote the electron transportation from the CB of TiO2 to the VB of Cu2O under light irradiation. This charge transfer increased the electron concentration at the CB of Cu2O and the hole concentration at the VB of TiO2, which endowed TiO2–Au–Cu2O with both high reduction (−1.04 V vs. NHE) and oxidation (+2.55 V vs. NHE) capabilities. The photocurrent density of TiO2–Au–Cu2O (Fig. 3A(b)) for CO2 reduction reached −1.82 mA cm−2 at +0.11 V vs. RHE, which is much better than the value of −1.10 mA cm−2 attained at TiO2–Cu2O (Fig. 3A(a)). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency of TiO2–Au–Cu2O is also superior over both pure Cu2O and the direct Z-scheme TiO2–Cu2O material.

Noble metals and organic ligands have been used as co-catalysts on the surface of TiO2 to promote photogenerated charge separation and visible light absorption. For example, Xu et al. fabricated a novel photocathode by modifying four different amine ligands, Pd nanoparticles and Eosin Y disodium salt (EY) dye on a functionalized TiO2 electrode for the PEC reduction of CO2, as shown in Fig. 3B.29 The presence of Pd nanoparticles accelerated the in situ production of H+ involved in the CO2 reduction process, while the adsorbed EY dye improved the light absorption of TiO2, while the amine ligands could effectively capture CO2 and activate its reduction. The maximum production rate and the highest selectivity of the main reduction product CH3OH were estimated to be 43.6 M cm−2 h−1 and ∼100%, respectively. Furthermore, the Faraday efficiency of the PEC cells surprisingly exceeded 1000% with the assistance of photoelectrons, which was ascribed to the synergistic effect between the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic processes.
Similarly, a heterogeneous photocathode was also prepared by covalently binding a Ru(II)-organic complex containing exposed pyridyl on TiO2 nanotube arrays for PEC reduction of CO2.28 The PEC cell produced 84.8 μmol methanol with 63.9% Faraday efficiency and 45% selectivity at −0.9 V after 8 h irradiation, while the non-covalent bonded system only produced 41.3 μmol methanol under the same experimental conditions. Such a significant difference was attributed to the strong light absorption capacity and the excellent charge transfer efficiency of Ru-pyridyl, which could promote the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs (Fig. 3C). The mechanistic investigation also revealed that the expose pyridyl provided the active sites during the formation of pyridiniumformate intermediates, which facilitated efficient CO2 methanolization.
As an n-type semiconductor, TiO2 is more frequently used as a photoanode than photocathode in PEC CO2 reduction systems. In these photoanode-driven PEC reduction systems, the photogenerated electrons are excited from the VB of the photoanode material to its CB, and then transferred to the cathode for reducing CO2. As displayed in Fig. 3D, Zhan et al. modified Ce–CdS quantum dots (QDs) on TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) to obtain Ce–CdS QDs|TiO2 NTs as the photoanode by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method, while Cu foam was used as a common cathode to reduce CO2.59 Compared to the CdS QDs|TiO2 NTs system, the Ce doped CdS QDs|TiO2 photoanode-driven system increased the yield of formic acid, the photocurrent density and the IPCE value by ∼1.4 times, 1.4 times and 1.6 times respectively, which is attributed to greater visible light absorbance, higher electron density and longer charge lifetime of the Ce–CdS QDs|TiO2 composite. Specifically, the formation of a new Ce 4f electronic state in the mid-gap region of Ce–CdS QDs promoted the migration of the photogenerated charges and retarded their recombination. The photogenerated holes at the VB of CdS reacted with the sacrificial reagent S2−via the redox couple Ce3+/Ce4+, which further increased the photocurrent.
Pan et al. constructed a photoanode-driven PEC system for the direct use of solar energy for CO2 reduction, as shown in Fig. 3E.4 In this system, nanosheet-like CoOx was prepared on the surface of copper foam via electrodeposition and used as the cathode, while a TiO2 nanotube array was used as the photoanode. Moreover, a thin layer of ZnO was deposited on the CoOx cathode by an atomic layer deposition technology as a protective layer to improve the stability of the CoOx cathode. The PEC CO2 reduction system exhibited a high CHOOH yield of 56.6 μmol cm−2 h−1.
In recent years, a new type of PEC reduction CO2 system has been developed by integrating both the photoanode and photocathode into a single system, named (PN junction)-driven system. The reduction mechanism of (PN junction)-driven system is similar to plant photosynthesis. For example, J. LaTempa et al. constructed a PEC cell with a p-type silicon nanowire array as the photocathode and an n-type TiO2 nanotube array film as the photoanode for reducing CO2 to hydrocarbon fuel.11 A maximum combined CH4 and C2H4 production rate of ∼201.5 nM cm−2 h−1 was obtained at an applied potential of −1.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Herein, Cu nanoparticles were modified on Si nanowires to improve photogenerated charge separation and product selectivity towards CO2 reduction, thereby improving the overall yield of the products.
By following different reaction mechanisms and pathways, CO2RR may produce various reduction products even including competitive products such as H2. Therefore, it is ideal to utilize advanced analytical techniques for distinguishing between the chemicals produced in the catalysis process. Gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector and flame ionization detector are normally used for the detection and analysis of the gas products of CO2RR.60 Meanwhile, high performance liquid chromatography, ion chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance are also utilized to detect the liquid products of CO2RR.61 All the above detection methods can accurately quantify and identify CO2 reduction products, which is of great significance for the evaluation of catalytic performance of PEC CO2RR.
PEC NRR at TiO2 (titanate) based photoelectrodes
In 1977, Schrauzer et al. first reported pioneering research on the photo-reduction of N2 by TiO2 in aqueous solution, which provided a new strategy for the synthesis of ammonia at ambient temperature and routine pressure.62 Recently, various modification methods such as formation of surface defects, cocatalysts, and heterojunctions including Z-schemes have made modified TiO2 (titanate) nano-materials the most frequently used optoelectronic materials for solar-driven nitrogen fixation.63,64 For example, it was reported that surface defect engineering could greatly improve visible light absorption and adjust the local electron state of charge trapping centers of the modified materials, which therefore promoted PEC NRR performance.33,65 As an example, Xu et al. developed an extrusion-based 3D printing technique to obtain a hierarchical porous TiO2 structure with multi-scale pores as the gas diffusion electrode for the NRR.66 The 3D printed hierarchical porous TiO2 photoelectrode exhibited high nitrogen fixation due to the large surface area, strong adsorption and high activity. N2 could effectively diffuse into the porous TiO2 photoelectrode and be reduced at high efficiency. More importantly, the TiO2 scaffold could be reused owing to its rigid structure, which is of great significance for its practical application. As shown in Fig. 4A, the surface oxygen vacancies (Ovac) produced a defect state below the conduction band of TiO2, which could not only adsorb and activate N2, but also serve as trapping sites for energy and electron transfer. Meanwhile, this new defect state will narrow the band gap to improve the absorption of visible light. Therefore, oxygen vacancies are formed on the catalyst surface to increase the conversion efficiency of N2 to NH3.

Using cocatalysts to improve performance is also an effective approach in this area. As one of the most common cocatalyst with a strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are normally deposited on semiconductors to promote charge separation of the composite and therefore increase the conversion efficiency of N2 fixation under visible light irradiation.67,68 In 2013, Oshikiri et al. developed a plasma-induced technology to prepare a Nb–SrTiO3 single crystal substrate for ammonia synthesis.69 As shown in Fig. 4B, Au and Ru NPs were respectively deposited on the front and back side of the Nb–SrTiO3 substrate, which was also used to separate the anode chamber (KOH/ethanol) from the cathode chamber (HCl). Under light irradiation, the LSPR effect excited hot electrons of Au NPs into the CB of Nb–SrTiO3, leaving holes on the Nb–SrTiO3 surface to efficiently oxidize hydroxyl ions and ethanol in the anode chamber. Meanwhile, the photogenerated electrons could reduce N2 at Ru surface in the cathode chamber. More interestingly, a chemical bias could be generated via adjusting the pH difference between the two compartments and applied on the PEC cell to promote NH3 synthesis without any external potential. However, H2 was also produced at the Ru surface, resulting in a relatively low NH3 yield rate of 1.1 nmol cm−2 h−1 due to the strong hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) capability of Ru.
Based on the above PEC system, Oshikiri et al. improved the conversion rate of N2 to NH3 by replacing Ru with a Zr/Zirconium oxide (Zr/ZrOx) thin film as the cocatalyst on the Nb–SrTiO3 photoelectrode to minimize the HER.70 The other side of Nb–SrTiO3 substrate was loaded with Au-NPs as the photoanode (Fig. 4C). Although both N2 and H+ reduction simultaneously occurred on the surface of Zr/ZrOx, the NH3 yield at Zr/ZrOx film was ∼6 times that achieved at the Ru cocatalyst, owing to the stronger adsorption of N than that of H atoms on Zr/ZrOx. In addition, the hot electron transfer excited by LSPR could promote electron–hole pair separation, allowing more electrons to be involved in N2 reduction and more holes to be trapped at the Au/Nb–SrTiO3 interface for the oxidation reaction. Accordingly, this PEC reduction system exhibited improved selectivity for N2 reduction and a higher NH3 synthesis rate than the system reported in the previous example.
The previous examples in this section demonstrated that both noble metal cocatalysts and surface defects could effectively improve the conversion of N2 to NH3 on TiO2 (titanate) materials, therefore the combination of these two modification techniques is expected to further promote the PEC catalytic capability of TiO2 (titanate). As a verification to the above assumption, a composite photocathode was prepared by photo-reduction of Au NPs on TiO2 nanorod (NR) arrays vertically grown on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass, followed by atomic layer deposition of an amorphous TiO2 thin film (a-TiO2) with abundant Ovac.71 As shown in Fig. 4D, the Au NPs could absorb visible light to provide hot electrons for NH3 synthesis. In addition, the surface Ovac can adsorb and activate N2 to improve the fixation of N2. Furthermore, a new defect level was formed below the a-TiO2 CB to capture photo-excited electrons, which promoted the separation of photo-generated charges. Due to the synergistic effect of surface Ovac and Au NPs, a NH3 production rate of ∼13.4 nmol cm−2 h−1 was obtained at a-TiO2/Au/TiO2 NR, which is ∼2.6 times higher than bare TiO2.
In addition, the development of heterojunctions or Z-schemes is another strategy to improve PEC NRR performance of TiO2 (titanate). For example, a MoS2@TiO2 heterojunction was prepared by Ye et al. for effective PEC NRR.72 As shown in Fig. 4E, PEC measurements were performed in a two-chamber H-type cell separated by a Nafion membrane. The oxygen evolution reaction took place in the anode chamber (eqn (1)), and H+ produced at the anode migrated to the MoS2@TiO2 photocathode chamber through the Nafion membrane, and reduced N2 to NH3. 3H2O → 6H+ + 1.5O2 + 6e−(1)The NRR yield and Faraday efficiency at MoS2@TiO2 (mole ratio: 1/2) photocathode were estimated to be 1.42 × 10−6 mol h−1 cm−2 and 65.52%, respectively with a bias of −0.2 V versus RHE. Furthermore, Fig. 4F shows that MoS2 is not only an effective cocatalyst on TiO2, but also provides adsorption sites for nitrogen fixation. Next, the well matched energy levels between MoS2 and TiO2 promoted the effective transport of photogenerated electrons to the active adsorption sites on MoS2 for selective nitrogen reduction, resulting in such a high NRR yield and Faraday efficiency for PEC NRR under visible light. Finally, the detailed catalytic performance data including main product, Faraday efficiency, production rate and applied potential for the examples listed in this review have been summarized in Table 1.

Though UV-vis and FT-IR spectrophotometry, fluorescence, ion chromatography and ion selective electrodes have been widely used to determine PEC NRR efficiency,37,73,74 the trace amount of NH3 contained in air or the experimental reagents may significantly decrease the accuracy of the detection results. Recently, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) combined with N isotope labeling has been used to ensure that the produced NH3 in PEC NRR is not from adventitious N2 containing species.75,76 However, it should be noted that in fact this approach was suggested much earlier when the photoelectrochemical production of NH3 was studied.41 When 15N2 is deliberately used as the gas source, 1H NMR spectroscopy can quantitatively and precisely distinguish 15NH4+ produced by the NRR from the contaminant 14NH4+ based on the difference between the chemical shift of 15N doublet coupling and that of 14N triplet coupling. Ideally, 1H NMR spectroscopy should be combined with spectrophotometry for the accurate determination of PEC NRR productivity.
Conclusions and perspectives
Because N2 and CO2 are abundant components in the atmosphere, the transformation of these two substances to usable resources will greatly benefit a sustainable environment. To date, many PEC NRRs have been performed on nano-TiO2 or titanate photoelectrodes, which are also one of the main photoelectrode materials used for PEC CO2RR. Therefore, a summary on PEC CO2RR and NRR using TiO2 (titanate) photoelectrodes is meaningful for further improvement and future practical application of these techniques.
Due to the high similarity between the experimental setups and electrode materials used for the PEC reduction of CO2 and N2, the two reactions are also facing similar critical challenges for further development. First, their practical application is still limited by the problems associated with photoelectrode materials such as limited absorption capacity of visible light, low charge separation efficiency, small energy conversion efficiency, low amount of active sites and poor stability.36,44,46,77–79 In addition, the competition between CO2RR/NRR and the HER significantly lowers the N2 conversion rate and selectivity of the CO2RR. Furthermore, H+ is easily adsorbed on the catalyst surface which will hinder the adsorption and dissociation of CO2/N2, and thus lower the selectivity and yield rate of the reduction reactions. To circumvent the above problems and further improve the PEC CO2RR/NRR, some novel strategies have been proposed and summarized as follows.
(1) The PEC reduction mechanism of both CO2 and N2 requires further study. Although the relevant mechanisms were studied by many researchers, a deep understanding and theoretical investigation for PEC reduction of CO2 and N2 is still an ongoing challenge, especially the influence of the electrode materials, the solvent and applied potential on the system. Accordingly, some advanced in situ characterization techniques and modeling methods have been used to precisely explore these processes. For example, Raman, infrared, X-ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopy are used to identify reaction intermediates, as well as the adsorption and reaction active sites in PEC CO2RR and NRR. In addition, density functional theory and molecular dynamics can be used for calculating energy barriers to control the CO2 and N2 conversion reaction in a more dynamical way while also taking into account the role of solvent molecules.
(2) The PEC reduction capability of TiO2 (titanate) based materials can be improved via the formation of photoactive heterojunctions (such as Z-schemes) using novel techniques such as site-selective nano-deposition. For example, the orientation controlled deposition of a photoactive nanostructure on another one could produce a spatially separated composite nanostructure, which will facilitate photo-induced charge separation and provide more active sites and hot electrons to reduce the overpotential and energy barrier for CO2RR/NRR.80,81 In addition, undesired side reactions such as HER in the reduction process could also be suppressed at the spatially separated composite nanostructures. Furthermore, recent work in the area of localized surface plasmon resonance driven chemical synthesis shows that tuning the wavelength of light can introduce selectivity in the chemical reaction, which may be a useful strategy for tuning the reaction products of CO2 reduction.82,83 Most importantly, it is necessary to investigate and understand the structure – performance relationship of PEC nanocatalysts, which would significantly improve the activity and efficiency, and further facilitate the rational structural design of these catalysts.
(3) The operando generation of defects on TiO2 (titanate) based materials could be an effective strategy for boosting catalytic activity for PEC NRR/CO2RR and suppress the competitive HER. Recently, tuning surface strain has become a new technique to produce operando defects, which are traditionally generated by an external force such as physically compressing or stretching the nanostructures. However, it is very difficult to correlate the catalytic performance with the surface strains without precisely tailoring surface strains on catalysts. Therefore, controllable approaches to produce and modulate strain in a desired way on the catalyst surface are highly required. Forming structural disorder alloys, selectively removing the alloy atoms, and precisely doping elements in nanocatalyts would represent promising approaches to controllably induce surface strains. They could modulate the surface electronic structure to an appropriate condition, decrease edge defects to suppress H+ adsorption and HER, and provide planar defects as active sites for N2 or CO2, resulting in the enhancement of catalytic performance.
