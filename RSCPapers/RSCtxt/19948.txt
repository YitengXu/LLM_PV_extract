    , Accepted 29th January 2021First published on 3rd March 2021AbstractThe development of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is facing a huge challenge due to high cost and insufficient lithium resources. With the large-scale application of electric vehicles and portable electronics, the demand for LIBs is growing rapidly. In this connection, it is urgent to find a new secondary battery technology to make up for the shortcomings of LIBs. Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) with low cost and high efficiency have drawn much attention. Particularly, layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) with large interlayer distance and diffusion paths have been intensively investigated as cathode materials for PIBs. However, LTMO cathode materials often exhibit unsatisfactory electrochemical performance caused by the large potassium ion radius. To this end, this review mainly summarizes the progress of the research on LTMO cathode materials in PIBs. Meanwhile, the potassium storage mechanism and structural transformation are also analyzed for different metal-based LTMO cathode materials (single metal materials, dual-metal-based materials and multi-metal-based materials). What's more, the key technical issues and scientific challenges faced by LTMO cathode materials in PIBs are analyzed. This review provides constructive insights into the development of PIBs based on LTMOs.
1. Introduction
With the drastic consumption of energy, people generally regard the use of new energy sources with renewable and environmentally friendly features as an efficient strategy to replace conventional energy sources. Solar, wind, and tidal energy represent today's new renewable energy sources, and their development is in line with the changing world. However, such energy sources have an indirect and transient nature, which seriously hinders their further development. Therefore, energy storage systems play a crucial role in integrating renewable energy sectors. To ensure the stability of the power system, it is essential to develop some massive energy storage systems.1 By virtue of its convenience and high efficiency, electrochemical energy storage (EES) is deemed to be an ideal energy storage method.2,3
Among the wide variety of applicable energy storage technologies, there is extensive research on rechargeable batteries as a common EES strategy for portable and efficient power storage.4,5 Since Sony commercialized lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in 1991, LIBs have been gradually but widely used in commercial fields, such as new energy vehicles and portable electronic devices due to the high energy density and energy conversion rate.6 However, as far as LIBs are concerned, the two indispensable elements, lithium and cobalt metal, are costly and not very abundant in Earth's crust.7 From the perspective of sustainable development, it is difficult to support the development of large-scale EES systems due to the scarcity of lithium (only 0.0017 wt% of Earth's crust). As elements of the same main group, sodium and potassium have abundant reserves. The most promising alternatives to LIBs have been considered to be sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), which have a “rocking chair” mechanism similar to LIBs,8,9 as shown in Fig. 1. Two different materials are used for the cathode and anode that can reversibly insert and extract alkali metal ions. The battery completes the charging and discharging through the transfer of alkali metal ions between the cathode and anode electrodes. However, due to the larger ion radius of K+ (1.38 Å) and Na+(1.02 Å) than Li+ (0.76 Å) (Fig. 2a), the desolvation energy of SIBs and PIBs in some solvents (e.g., propylene carbonate (PC) solution) is reduced, and so is the corresponding charge transfer resistance, thus yielding faster electrode dynamics than in LIBs.10,11 In recent years, compared with SIBs, PIBs have attracted special attention. The natural abundances of potassium and sodium are similar, and both are higher than that of lithium. The standard electrode potential for K+/K (−2.94 V, relative to a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) is lower than the standard electrode potential for Li+/Li (−3.04 V, relative to a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)), resulting in higher working voltage (Fig. 2b). Besides, compared to Na+, K+ can reversibly insert into graphite, which satisfies the anode demand to a certain extent. Moreover, K will not alloy with aluminum foil (which means that aluminum foil can replace the more costly copper foil as a current collector) and take the place of aluminum foil, thereby saving costs.12 Please note that K+ has a higher diffusion rate than Na+ and Li+ due to the minimal Stokes radius (3.6 Å) within PC solvent.13 Furthermore, in non-aqueous electrolytes, K+ ions have higher ionic conductivity which can have huge potential in terms of their power development characteristics. PIBs, while offering many unique advantages in large-scale energy storage applications, also severely limit the electrochemical performance due to the larger ion radius, the low energy density, and the greater structural stresses during the decoupling dynamics. Therefore, the development of suitable cathode materials, anode materials, and high-performance electrolytes has become the key to boosting the electrochemical properties of PIBs.

(d) Advantages of layered transition metal oxides. 
Among the above components, the electrode materials play a decisive role in the inherent electrochemical characteristics (cycling ability and rate performance). Hence, searching for efficient electrode materials, especially cathode materials, has become the top priority to solve the energy density problem of PIBs. In commercial applications, the cost of cathode materials is relatively high, and the capacity of cathodes is lower than that of anodes. The anode materials usually have an excess capacity which results in a low full battery capacity. Therefore, this problem can be solved by developing suitable cathode materials. However, the larger size of K+ causes many cathode materials to collapse in the structure during the harsh potassiation/depotassiation process, thus resulting in low capacity and short cycle life. Fig. 2c shows the number of scientific papers on cathode potassium materials in the past five years. Among several common cathode materials for PIBs (layered metal oxides, Prussian blue and its analogs, polyanion compounds, and organic cathode materials), layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) are widely considered because of their simple structure and easy synthesis (Fig. 2d). Besides, the large interlayer distance and diffusion path can fully accommodate the larger ions.14 The application of LTMOs as cathodes in LIBs and SIBs has been extensively studied. In lithium-based transition metal oxides, some elements (Ti, V, etc.) are inert to Li+ intercalation, but their Na-based counterpart complexes exhibit activity for Na+ intercalation.15,16 Unlike Li and Na systems, some representative potassium-containing LTMOs show low reversible capacity and multilevel phase inversion (caused by voltage change), which can be attributed to the strong mutual repulsion between potassium ions and the stable K+/vacancy arrangement.18–20 In recent years, many groups have researched various types of transition metal oxide. For example, some transition metal ion doping was used to improve K+ half-cell and full-cell performance. Several review articles systematically elaborated on the classification and structural characteristics of various PIB cathode materials.21–28 There are no specific discussions to our knowledge on the specific structural characteristics of LTMOs or explanations for the potassium storage mechanism during cycling.
This review summarizes the recent developments in the use of LTMOs as cathode materials for PIBs, and focuses on their structural transformation, potassium storage mechanism, electrochemical performance, existing problems and challenges, and further improvements in several areas. Moreover, the applications of these cathodes in a full battery are discussed. Meanwhile, the special material designs are introduced, including mixed-phase preparation, metal replacement and morphological modification to improve the overall performance of the material, as well as sacrificial salt compensation and protective coating strategies to reduce irreversible phase changes during cycling and enhance stability in air. These in-depth insights into layered metal oxides can inspire the structural design of new types of cathode material for PIBs in the future.
2. Structure type and evolution of LTMOs in alkali metal batteries
It was first reported in the 1980s how LTMOs were used as cathode materials for LIB and SIB electrodes. LiCoO2 and NaCoO2 have shown electrochemical de-intercalation behavior.29–31 LTMOs have been extensively studied,30 and they have been widely used as cathode materials for LIBs and SIBs. Besides, the structure types of LTMO are relatively stable, but there are many variants, and at the same time, all kinds of LTMO are relatively small.2 Therefore, relevant research on LTMOs in PIBs is limited. A brief description of the structure types and structurally evolved laminar transition metal oxides is provided in this section.
The general formula of transition metal oxides can be expressed as AxMO2 (0 < x < 1; A = Li, Na, K; M = V, Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cr, etc.). As mentioned above, LiCoO2 is already a proven lithium-ion battery electrode material for commercial applications. Besides, there are common LTMOs consisting of alkali metal ions which are also mature cathode materials, such as LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 and NaFeO2. Materials that typically have a layered rock salt structure with an Rm space group are mainly formed by stacking MO2 layers. Alkali metal ions exist between adjacent MO2 layers. When MO2 layers along the c-axis are stacked in a different order, the positions occupied by alkali metal ions between the layers will change accordingly, thereby forming different layered structures. Delmas et al. have suggested a symbol system for LTMOs which contain alkali metals.32,33 From the schematic diagram of a typical layered structure of AxMO2,34 transition metal oxides can be divided into the following three typical types: O3-type, P3-type, and P2-type. The O3-type layered material is stacked in an ABCABC mode, while the P3-type and P2-type are in ABBCCA and ABACAB modes, respectively. The structure is shown in Fig. 3. O and P represent the coordination environment where the alkali metal ions are in octahedral and prismatic points under different stacking modes; the numbers 3 and 2 indicate the number of transition metal ions occupying different positions determined by the oxygen ion stacking mode. In addition, when the local unit cells in the layered structure deform symmetrically, an apostrophe is added between the letters and numbers.

The research on LTMOs in SIBs can provide good references for PIBs. For example, NaxMO2 will form the P2-type and O3-type with the change of x; usually 0.6 < x < 0.7 in the P2-type and 0.7 < x < 1 in the O3-type.35 KxMnO2 can form P2-K0.3MnO2 and P3-K0.45MnO2 because of the difference in x. The content of K+ acts on the structure and morphology of the sample in a remarkable way.36 In addition, Hironaka et al. synthesized P2-KxCoO2 at 600 °C, while the formation of P3-KxCoO2 only needs 400 °C.19 The structure of the material is affected by the reaction temperature. Generally, higher temperature conditions are more suitable for the P2-type than P3-type. In addition, their structures are also affected by the types of transition metal element. In single metal systems, KxScO2 can form a stable O3-type structure,37 KxCrO2 can form a stable O3-type or P3-type structure,38 and KxMnO2 and KxCoO2 can form a stable P2-type or P3-type structure.19,36 In binary metal systems or multi-metal systems, some existing studies are based on partial transition metal substitution and introduction of doping atoms into single metal systems without changing the original layered structure, such as in P2-K0.44Ni0.22Mn0.78O2,39 P3-K0.48Mn0.4Co0.6O2,40 P3-K0.67Mn0.83Ni0.17O2,41 P2-K0.75[Mn0.8Ni0.1Fe0.1]O2,42 P3-K0.5[Mn0.8Fe0.1Ni0.1]O2 (ref. 43), and so forth. At present, no research has pointed out the types of stable layered structure possessed by other transition monometallic systems. During charging and discharging, as the alkali metal ion insertion/extraction reaction proceeds, the layered structure of transition metal oxides undergoes a series of changes. O3-NaMO2 will change to P3-NaMO2 when charging. Conversely, the discharge is the P3-type to O3-type transition,8 which is a reversible process. In the same way, there is a similar performance in PIBs. For O3-KCrO2, there are O3 → P3, O3 → O′3 and O′3 → P′3 transitions in the reversible transformation process of P3 and O3-type structures.38 In the middle, the interlayer slips of the MO2 layer occur due to the influence of the change in the content of K+ between the layers, resulting in structural changes. This change will not break the Cr–O bond. The above-mentioned P3-KxCoO2 was synthesized at 400 °C and P2-KxCoO2 was synthesized at 600 °C.19 The transformation of the P3-type to the P2-type is generally accompanied by the breaking of the Co–O bond. The electrochemical characteristic is not sufficient to provide the energy required for this transition, so there is no structural transition between the P3-type and P2-type during charging and discharging. For P2-NaxMO2,47 there are structural changes similar to those of the P3-type and O3-type during the cycling. The P2-type will reversibly change to the O2-type due to the Na+ content and the slip of the MO2 layer.44 However, research on P2-KxMO2 cathode materials has not yet reached a similar conclusion. This result may be attributed to the fact that the size radius of K+ is larger than that of Na+, which makes it easier for K+ to occupy a larger prism space than the octahedral space between MO2 layers. The formation of a more stable P-type structure is the reason why researchers have turned to pay more attention to P-type layered metal oxides in recent years while using binary or multi-metal systems to modify the electrochemical performance of materials.
However, vanadium oxide with an amorphous layered structure is one of the materials favored by researchers. In K2V3O8, a reversible phase transition between KV3O8 and K2V3O8 is discovered during K+ insertion and extraction, but the volume change rate caused by this transformation process is as high as 23.4%.45 This process will lead to mechanical destruction of the material's structure and attenuation of capacity. In addition, some studies indicate that structural water can support and stabilize the layered structure of the material.46,47 This promoting effect of structured water on the electrochemical performance of materials needs further study.
The electrochemical properties of electrode materials are closely related to their inherent microstructure and the influence of alkali metal ions on the material's structure. An ideal positive electrode should have practical advantages:27 (i) it should accommodate a large number of alkali metal ions (with a high theoretical specific capacity); (ii) it should show a high standard redox potential; (iii) it should maintain structural integrity during cycling (with a long cycle life); (vi) the diffusion coefficient of alkali metal ions should be large, and the conductivity to electrons should be high (with high rate performance); (v) it should have high chemical stability and thermal stability (and not cause side reactions with the electrolyte (good battery efficiency and safety)); (vi) it should be environmentally friendly, have low cost and high efficiency, etc. Transition metal oxides have many of the above-mentioned advantages, and to a certain extent show their application prospects as cathode materials for PIBs. With regard to LTMOs, their structures are affected by the initial K content, the type of transition metal and other conditions. As a matter of fact, different materials often exhibit different structural evolution in electrochemical reactions. Therefore, transition metal oxides usually have some issues such as continuous capacity decay and slow reaction kinetics. A number of research studies on the electrochemical performance and potassium storage mechanism have been performed on these issues. They are discussed in detail below.
3. Transition metal oxides as cathodes for PIBs
3.1 Single metal materials

3.1.1 Mn-Based materials. 
In recent years, low-cost, low-toxicity Mn-based materials for layered oxide cathodes have been developed rapidly. But they are limited by poor cycle life and rate performance. Various techniques such as surface modification, reducing the particle size, and morphology and structure modulation are commonly used to improve their performance.48
The P2-type and P3-type KxMnO2 are the most extensively investigated systems in this category. Vaalma et al. introduced a non-aqueous K-ion battery on the basis of layered K0.3MnO2 which significantly exhibited a reliable cycling behavior from 3.5 to 1.5 V vs. K+/K (Fig. 4a). Even at 2C-rate, it showed a high capacity retention of 72% and a high voltage efficiency. The hard carbon/carbon black composite was capable of delivering up to 200 mA h g−1 and the layered birnessite K0.3MnO2 136 mA h g−1 (Fig. 4b and c).49 Liu et al. prepared Mn-based layered KxMnO2 (x = 0.3 and 0.45) with P2/P3-type structures via a simplified co-precipitation method. They observed that K0.45MnO2 under the same synthesis conditions had differential structures and smaller particle sizes. In contrast, K0.45MnO2 performed somewhat better than K0.3MnO2. At 20 mA g−1, it could offer 128.6 mA h g−1 reversible specific capacity with an average voltage of 2.75 V, as well as a high rate performance with a specific capacity of 51.2 mA h g−1 even at 200 mA g−1.36 Investigation of K0.28MnO2·0.15H2O with a two-dimensional open framework was carried out as an intercalation host for K+. The water molecules inside the interlayers among the MnO2 layers might be essential as structural support pillars during repeated cycling. This cathode delivered a high reversible capacity of 150 mA h g−1 when cycling at 0.1C for 100 cycles or more, as well as acceptable power capability up to 5C-rate.46

Kim et al. once worked on a potential reversible phase change of P3–O3–X for the P3-K0.5MnO2 during its electrochemical process.50 As illustrated in Fig. 4d, during K+ extraction, the (003) peak and (006) peak shift towards lower angles, reflecting the MnO2 slab distance expansion, which is common in layered alkali-transition metal-oxide compounds. More importantly, the (015) peak in KxMnO2 disappears and a new (104) peak emerges at x ≈ 0.41. Unfortunately, the (104) peak coincides with the Al peak at ≈18.5°; however, when the K+ is extracted, it develops into a distinct shoulder-like peak. This characterization indicates a phase change from the P3 to the O3 structure with the removal of K+. Upon further K-extraction to x ≈ 0.34 in KxMnO2, a novel collection of XRD peaks emerge to the left of the (003) and (006) peaks, showing that another phase transition is happening. They put off explicitly determining the structure of this new phase in the highly charged state and denote the phase as “X” (Fig. 4e).50 In particular, in situ and operando XRD are usually used to observe the crystal structure and phase changes of active materials during charge–discharge cycling. When LTMOs are used as the cathode of PIBs, the main focus is to understand the crystal structure changes in different stages of charging and discharging, and operando XRD research has made a significant contribution to revealing various phase transitions of different cathode materials. The in situ and operando XRD characterization of electrodes involves simultaneous real-time online analysis of reaction products under realistic reaction conditions. Its main advantage lies in the continuous monitoring of electrochemical, physical or chemical processes on a single sample or device under operating conditions, without the need to prepare multiple samples for ex situ measurement, and it can detect some non-equilibrium short intermediate states that cannot be captured by ex situ characterization.
Another aspect that has been extensively studied is the control of morphologies and structures, so that the electrode has a longer cycle life and high energy density. Lei's group formed in situ biphasic layers for a Mn-based oxide cathode.51 This structure could address both the irreversible phase transition and the dissolution of Mn2+. The stable electrochemical performance of KIBs was achieved by forming biphasic layers of robust SEI film and a non-active K-poor spinel interlayer on the surface of P2-KMO (Fig. 5a). This results in the reversibility of redox reactions with a 9.9% volume change during the (de)potassiation, enabling good rate capability and steady performance for 300 cycles with a capacity retention of 90.5% and coulombic efficiency of up to 100% at 50 mA g−1.51 Chong et al. constructed K1.06Mn8O16 nanorod/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrids, which possessed a large specific surface area, high K-ion transportability, and efficient electron transfer paths. They exhibited a highest discharge capacity of 321.8 mA h g−1 at 10 mA g−1 and superior rate capability (187.1 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1).21 Mn-based layered oxide (K0.32MnO2) microspheres self-assembled from ultrathin nanosheets were constructed as potential cathode electrodes for non-aqueous KIBs (Fig. 5b), with a reversible discharge capacity of 95.1 mA h g−1 at 10 mA g−1.25

P3-K0.5MnO2 hollow sub-microspheres were synthesized through a scalable two-step self-templating strategy (Fig. 5c). The obtained electrode has the comprehensive advantages of good cycle stability, excellent rate performance and size synergy. Apart from the above-mentioned advantages, they also possessed a high degree of crystallinity, spherical morphology, and inner hollow features. Similarly, a high energy density of 100.7 W h kg−1 can be achieved with a hollow sub-microsphere cathode//graphite anode potassium-ion full cell.52 AlF3 coated K1.39Mn3O6 microspheres exhibited a high reversible capacity of 110 mA h g−1 at 10 mA g−1, as well as excellent rate capability and cycling stability (Fig. 5d). They exhibit 94.9% capacity retention over 100 cycles, which is far better than that of uncoated microspheres or the bulk counterpart.53
As a cathode material, layered manganese oxide can not only form a stable P2-type or P3-type structure and exhibit good electrochemical performance, but can also help reduce cost and solve environmental protection problems. In fact, research on multi-metal layered oxides based on Mn has been conducted by many groups.


3.1.2 Co-Based materials. 
Commercialization of Co-based layered oxide cathodes for Li-ion batteries is already underway. Due to the excellent efficiency of rate performance and stability of discharge voltage, K-ion batteries have also made some important progress.1 A layered P2-type K0.6CoO2 cathode was demonstrated by Kim et al. to provide a reversible capacity of 80 mA h g−1 with the K content in KxCoO2 varying from 0.33 to 0.68 and an average redox potential of 2.7 V (vs. K/K+).18 Hironaka et al. reported potassium intercalation behavior in P2-type and P3-type KxCoO2 and phase evolution depending on the K content in K-ion cells. The K intercalation for K–Co layered oxides, P2-type and P3-type KxCoO2 (x < 1), showed that the electrodes undergo reversible and topotactic K intercalation in non-aqueous K cells. Both P2- and P3-KxCoO2 deliver a reversible capacity of ca. 60 mA h g−1 in the voltage range of 2.0–3.9 V with good cycle stability and rate performance.19 A facile and self-templated autoflow synthesis method was used to synthesize P2-type K0.6CoO2 microspheres. Due to the special morphology and hierarchical structure, the homogeneous P2-K0.6CoO2 microspheres exhibited a high specific capacity of 82 mA h g−1 at 10 mA g−1 and maintained a high capacity of 65 mA h g−1 at 40 mA g−1 for more than 300 cycles, with a capacity decay rate of 0.04% per cycle.54 A first-principles study of the phase stability of layered KxCoO2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) in the O1/P3/O3 family of host structures has been reported to determine the ordering preferences of K within each host. P3 hosts are considered to be stable at moderate K concentrations and display multiple hierarchical structures, characterized by well-ordered domains separated by inverse phase boundaries.55
Although Co-based materials have good electrochemical performance, Co is in short supply and its cost is high. Therefore, it is necessary to find new materials to ease the pressure on resources. Sometimes, Co can be introduced into LTMOs as a heteroatom to improve electrochemical performance.


3.1.3 Cr-Based materials. 
O3-KCrO2 was synthesized under an argon atmosphere by simple solid-phase sintering.38 KScO2 and KCrO2 have the lowest energy among O3-type layered structures and the most stable structure of various KMO2 (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, etc.)56–59 compounds (Fig. 6a). It is indicated that KScO2 and KCrO2 have good thermodynamic stability as layered metal oxides. The XRD patterns are indexed to the Rm space group (Fig. 6b) indicating that the prepared KCrO2 sample has an O3-type ABCABC oxygen stacking sequence, in which Cr and K ions occupy octahedral sites (Fig. 6c). They have first charge/discharge capacities of 135 and 92 mA h g−1 in the half-cell test (Fig. 6d). In general, the charge and discharge curves are almost identical, which mainly explains the reversible decalcification reaction of K. In Fig. 6e, the location and intensity of the oxidation and reduction peaks in the dQ/dV curve coincide well, which is in accordance with the reversibility of the K+ insertion and extraction reactions. Combining Fig. 6d and e, it can be found that multiple phase changes will occur with the change of K content.

This conclusion is deeply supported by in situ XRD results. The typical charge and discharge curves of the KCrO2 cathode with a current rate of 2 mA g−1 are presented in Fig. 7a and b illustrates the corresponding in situ XRD patterns. Fig. 7c and d magnify the highlighted area in Fig. 7b. The in situ XRD patterns show that during the charging process, as the repulsive force among oxygen atoms increases, the interlayer distance of the MO2 layer after K+ de-intercalation increases, corresponding to the small angle deviation of the (006) crystal plane in Fig. 7b. In the discharge process, the XRD profile returns to the original angle, indicating the reversibility of its structure. Fig. 7d signifies the sequence of phase transitions that occurs with the variation of K+ content with the charge/discharge process. The result of forming a large number of different phase structures is consistent with the stepped charge distribution in Fig. 6a. O3-type KxCrO2 undergoes a complex and reversible phase transition of O3–O′3–P′3–P3–P′3–P3–O3 during the K extraction process. The reinsertion of K+ takes the reverse path of K+ extraction, indicating that it is reversible. But even at the end of the discharge, the in situ XRD test shows that the O′3 type structure will not be converted to the O3-type structure. The result shows that when the KxCrO2 material is discharging, K+ cannot be completely re-intercalated. With the increase of K+ intercalation content, the slow change of K+ intercalation kinetics makes it difficult for K+ to re-embed into the MO2 layer of the KxCrO2 material. Electrochemical testing and characterization results show that O3-KCrO2 is able to be utilized as a type of cathode material for KIBs, offering a reversible capacity of approximately 90 mA h g−1.38 Similarly, Nirmalesh et al.60 synthesized KCrS2 as a positive electrode of KIBs, proving that O′3-K0.8CrS2 and P3-K0.39CrS2 have good reversibility during the charging and discharging process. KCrS2 has an original discharge capacity of 71 mA h g−1 and 90% of the initial capacity is retained after 1000 cycles.60 O3-KCrO2 shows good cycling stability and rate performance, indicating that the KIB system may become an effective technology for large-scale energy storage. It is useful to discuss the electrochemical properties of O3-KCrO2 and the K storage mechanism for studying other Cr-based layered metal oxides.

In addition, Hwang and his colleagues successfully synthesized pure P3-K0.69CrO2 from O3-NaCrO2 using an electrochemical ion exchange method.61 This electrode was first operated to be a high-powered cathode for KIBs. In the voltage range of 1.5–3.8 V (vs. K+/K), the reversible transition of P3-K0.69CrO2 was observed, corresponding to a high reversible capacity of 100 mA h g−1 at 0.1C (Fig. 8b).61 It is not easy to synthesize pure P3-KxCrO2 under conventional solid-phase sintering conditions. However, in the process of ion exchange, the Na+/K+ exchange process gradually becomes slow after a few cycles.62 The phase is successfully converted into P3-KxCrO2. After the completion of the ion exchange process, all the diffraction peaks are apportioned to the pure P3-type layered structure.19 In addition, after 300 cycles, the Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern of the cycled electrode was nearly identical to the simulated pattern of the P3-KxCrO2 structure. To gain an understanding of the effect of the K content on the potassium storage mechanism, this work used first-principles calculation to calculate the formation energies of P3-KxCrO2 as a function of the K content (0.11 ≤ x ≤ 0.83) using first-principles calculations.61 The calculation results indicated that the P3-KxCrO2 cathode was reversibly operated at low formation energy in the voltage range of ∼1.84 to ∼3.96 V (vs. K+/K). Fig. 8b illustrates the prediction of the P3-KxCrO2 cathodic redox potential range as a function of the K content (0.11 ≤ x ≤ 0.83) superimposed on the GITT curves in the voltage range of 1.5–3.8 V (Fig. 8c).61 According to the calculation data prediction and electrochemical results, it can be concluded that the P3-type structure can reversibly change in the voltage range of 1.5–3.8 V when the K+ content is 0.22 ≤ x ≤ 0.69. Consistent with the conclusion of O3-KCrO2, when K+ was released from the MO2-layer of P3-KxCrO2, the c lattice parameter of the P3-KxCrO2 cathode gradually increased because of the repulsion force between the two neighboring oxygen layers (O2−–O2−),17,63,64 as commonly observed in the layered oxide cathode materials in LIBs and SIBs upon the deintercalation process. For the present work, they developed Cr-based layered oxides as cathode materials, not for commercial applications due to the toxicity, but for scientific queries to confirm the feasibility of the K interlayer. In order to improve practicality, it is necessary to perform further studies on the optimization of the electrolyte solution and reduce the slow ion exchange process.65,66 An elementary analysis of transmission electron microscopy and EDX mapping of O3-NaCrO2 and P3-KxCrO2 indicated that the Na+ in the O3-NaCrO2 cathode was completely exchanged for K+.

Nirmalesh et al. made some improvements on the basis of O3-KCrO2, and synthesized P′3-K0.8CrO2, which can be used as a stable positive electrode for KIBs.67 Through the in situ XRD test, it was found that the phase change of P′3-K0.8CrO2 and the phase change of O3-KCrO2 are different during charging and discharging. Throughout the first charge and discharge, the structure undergoes a reversible change of P′3 → P3 → P3/P′3 → P′3, and then after the cycle is stable, the structural changes of P′3 → P′3/P3 → P3 → P′3 → P′3/O′3 → O′3 are observed.67 It can be found that during the charging and discharging, there is no O3-type structure, and only the P′3 type persists. This structure is stable, resulting in a volume change rate of only 1.08% while providing a large space. The shape point position facilitates the diffusion of K+, thereby effectively improving the cycle stability and rate performance of the material.
Although many studies have been carried out on Cr-based layered metal oxides, they have not yet completely solved the complex phase transition problems in the entire initial charge and discharge. In general, Cr-based layered metal oxides have a high theoretical specific capacity, but the capacity is difficult to exert and the capacity attenuation is severe. The reason is that the electrical conductivity of the material itself is poor, and the layered structure is unstable in terms of electrochemical behavior, and cannot be well matched with K+. The above work has contributed to the design and development of new layered metal oxide cathode materials.


3.1.4 V-Based materials. 
Hierarchical transition metal oxides of vanadium oxide exhibit a large MO2 interlayer spacing and the multivalent state properties of vanadium ions, making them have broad prospects in the storage of Na+ and K+ (ref. 68–74) and polyvalent ions (such as Mg2+).75–77 An interesting phenomenon is that pure α-V2O5 shows an irreversible transition during the first cycle with the formation of a stable α′-NaV2O5.78 Multiple studies have shown that layered metal oxides often have turbine stacking faults, and MO2 layers are almost randomly stacked on top of each other.45 Because the vanadium MO2 layer has a high capacity for containment and reduces the diffusion barrier, more alkali metal ions can be stored.68,78 Based on first-principles calculations, Daniel Koch et al. studied the insertion energy and diffusion barriers of four distinct phases of vanadium oxides (α-V2O5, β-V2O5, bronze-type vanadium dioxide [VO2(B)], and rutile-type VO2 [VO2(R)]) for KIBs.79 The structure diagram below shows the most likely sites for K+ insertion, as seen in Fig. 9. The difference between the metastable β-V2O5 and the orthogonal α-V2O5 can be imagined as the rotation of the [V2O5] layer around the a lattice direction,80,81 causing a larger channel-like structure in the a–b plane. After calculation, the related insertion energy and diffusion barrier are plotted. This study uses the same calculation settings to compare and evaluate different phases and stoichiometric vanadium oxides (α-V2O5, β-V2O5VO2(B), and VO2(R)).79 These results will be useful for future in-depth studies on the rational selection of vanadium oxide materials at other charge states.

Vanadium oxides often cannot form stable P-type structures similar to Co-based or Mn-based layered oxides, but they often form disordered layered structures. Daniel et al. reported that water inspired structural rearrangements of the vanadium–oxygen octahedra and increased the stability of the highly disordered potassium-intercalated vanadium oxide nanosheets.46 Vanadium oxides and vanadates exhibit diverse structures and multiple valence states such as KV5O13,82 K3V5O14,82 KV3O8,83 K0.25V2O5 (ref. 84) and K0.5V2O5.83,85 A stratified potassium vanadate, K0.5V2O5, was introduced by Leqing et al.86 The as-fabricated material provides a reversible capacity of approximately 90 mA h g−1 at 10 mA g−1 in the voltage range of 1.5–3.8 V (vs. K+/K), and demonstrates 81% capacity retention after 250 cycles at 100 mA g−1.86 The ex situ XRD test and XPS (Fig. 10) characterization show that K0.5V2O5 exhibits high reversibility in the process of charging and discharging. The insertion and extraction of K+ in the material are accompanied by the transition of V4+ and V5+ chemical states. Similarly, K2V3O8 (ref. 44) can deliver a high reversible capacity over 100 mA h g−1 in the voltage range of 1.5–4.5 V, which is higher than that of K0.5V2O5.86 But its cycling stability is relatively poor (73% of capacity retained after 50 cycles). Also, in ex situ XRD and XPS characterization (Fig. 11a–c and f–h), V4+ and V5+ valence change is observed. The difference is that during the cycling, K2V3O8 undergoes a non-total K insertion and extraction process, accompanied by a reversible phase change between KV3O8 and K2V3O8. Such a transformation process causes a large volume change of about 23.4%, thereby causing mechanical failure of the electrode materials.44

Regarding K2V3O8, its structure is stable and it has a P4bm space group with a quadrilateral structure, as shown in Fig. 11e. Jae et al. further demonstrated that it was coordinated with four hendecahedra of KO11, VO5, and VO4, where one VO5 shares its four oxygens with four VO4 tetrahedra producing four penta-shaped voids that allow insertion and extraction of K+.87 They proved that the discharge response proceeds through the K+ insertion into hendecahedrally coordinated potassium sites.87
In previous studies on KxV2O5, including K0.42V2O5,88 K0.5V2O5 (ref. 86) and K0.51V2O5,89 their insufficient initial K+ content limited the energy density in the full cell because virtually all recyclable K+ was provided by the cathode material. In order to further increase the initial K+ content in KxV2O5, K0.83V2O5 was prepared.28 The cycling stability test shows that more than 80% of the capacity is retained and the coulomb efficiency exceeds 99.2% after 200 cycles. Through experimental research and theoretical simulations, the material can change the fold degree of the [V2O5] layer by changing the distance between the layers. This change provides additional flexibility to reduce deformation and maintain the structural integrity of the K+ insertion/extraction process, thereby stabilizing the cycling performance. Pairing this K0.83V2O5 with a commercial graphite anode allows the construction of a full cell with an energy density of 136 W h kg−1 (based on the total mass of K0.83V2O5 and graphite in the cell). Its average operating voltage is about 2.4 V.28 This work proved the commercialization possibility of KxV2O5 and laid the foundation for the further design of new layered transition metal oxide materials with high initial K+ content.

3.2 Dual-metal-based materials
Layered Mn-based oxides are particularly attractive among transition metal oxides because of their large capacity and low-cost advantages. However, the Jahn–Teller effect caused by Mn3+ will inevitably cause structural degradation, resulting in poor electrochemical performance.90,91 To solve this problem, other transition metal ions (e.g. Ni, Co, Fe, and Mg) are used as additives to weaken the Jahn–Teller effect. This is mainly based on the induced cation rearrangement to enhance electrochemical performance.92–94 Through the cation rearrangement, the average oxidation state of Mn can be increased, thereby suppressing the multi-phase transition in the K+ deintercalation process and avoiding the structure disorder due to the Jahn–Teller effect. Ohzuku et al. first used LiCoO2 and LiNiO2 to form LiNi0.5Co0.5O2 one-to-one solid solution and applied it in LIBs.95 A single-phase reaction instead of a multi-phase reaction was exhibited during the electrochemical reaction test, thus verifying the effect of ion doping.

3.2.1 Ni–Mn-Based materials. 
Ion exchange is an effective strategy because Na+ (1.02 Å) and K+ (1.37 Å) have similar ionic radii, and the crystal structure is not changed during the exchange. According to reports, P2-K0.64Na0.04[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 was synthesized by electrochemical ion-exchange, using P2-Na0.64[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 as a sacrificial template. The tendency of larger K+ to occupy prismatic sites preferentially leads to a potential higher than the expected potential (4.65 V), resulting in a P2–O2 transition. By setting the voltage to inhabit the P2–O2 phase conversion zone, higher cycling stability can be achieved. As shown in Fig. 12a and b, owing to the delay of the P2–O2 phase transition and the high diffusion rate during the K+ extraction process, reversible specific capacities of 82 and 75 mA h g−1 are obtained in the voltage range of 1.5–4.5 V, when charged at 0.5C/15C and discharged at 0.5C.96 Besides, P′2-K0.83[Ni0.05Mn0.95]O2 delivered a high energy density of 155 mA h g−1 (420 W h kg−1) at 52 mA g−1.97 The low activation barrier energy of 271 meV helps in the rapid migration of K+ and provides excellent cycling stability with 77% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 520 mA g−1 (Fig. 12c–g). The full battery paired with the hard carbon anode can output a high energy density of 283 W h kg−1 in the voltage range of 0.5–4.0 V and has good cycling stability. The analysis of operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction (O-SXRD) shows that the P′2–OP4 phase transition process does not appear in the range of 1.5–4.3 V, which is also an important factor to maintain long-cycle stability (Fig. 13a). It is further revealed by first-principles calculations that the potassium storage mechanism of Kx[Ni0.05Mn0.95]O2 helps to maintain the stability of the overall structure by maintaining the single-phase reaction of the P′2 phase (Fig. 13b–f). The same electrochemical ion exchange was adopted to synthesize P2-K0.75[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2, which exhibited satisfactory electrochemical performance. As observed from Figure 12h, 86% capacity retention after 200 cycles and 83% after 500 cycles were obtained at 1400 mA g−1.14 The excellent electrochemical performance is inseparable from the large interval between layers. Fig. 13g and h show the process of electrochemical exchange. It can be concluded that the formed P2-K0.75[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 has a large interlayer distance (6.5 Å). O-SXRD and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy studies have shown that the single-phase reaction of the Ni4+/2+ redox pair is the key to excellent electrode performance when the operating voltage is 1.5–4.3 V (vs. K+/K). By comparing the formation energy of P2/O2-Kx[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 with different K contents (Fig. 13i), P2-Kx[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 is more stable than O2-Kx[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2. Using first-principles calculations and combining research results, the storage capacity of K was verified. In addition, some reasonable predictions were put forward: (i) as the K content in the structure approaches ∼0 or ∼1 mol, the c-axis parameter will be greatly reduced; (ii) reducing the prism (such as P2 or P3) c-axis parameter of the layered structure will lead to the crystal slip phenomenon, and the phase transforms into an octahedron (Fig. 13j).

Ni is selected as a dopant for a similar ion radius of Ni2+ (0.69 Å) and Mn3+ (0.645 Å).98 As for P3-K0.5MnO2, the extension of the z-axis in the MnO6 octahedron caused by Mn3+ leads to a difference in the distance between Mn and O in the octahedron.99 P3-K0.5[Ni0.1Mn0.9]O2 was prepared to suppress the Jahn-Teller effect by reducing the ratio of Mn3+.100 The presence of Ni can maintain the stability of the overall structure and suppresses the shrinkage and expansion of the lattice by sharing oxygen with Mn (Fig. 14a and b). According to O-SXRD, K0.5[Ni0.1Mn0.9]O2 undergoes the O3 → P3 → P′3 phase transition during the process of K+ insertion. Ex situ XANES analysis reveals that the average oxidation state of Mn after doping Ni is increased (Fig. 14d–h). Zhang et al. designed P2-type K0.44Ni0.22Mn0.78O2 as a new type of Ni/Mn-based layered oxide with a capacity of 125.5 mA h g−1 available at a current density of 10 mA g−1.39 Assembly of the full battery with soft carbon as the anode caused 70 mA h g−1 discharge capacity at 50 mA g−1, and a 90% capacity retention after 500 cycles. The first two cycles of in situ XRD analysis explored the single solid-solution processes under the P2 frame, showing a small volume change of 1.5% (Fig. 14c). It should be noted that during the potassiation/depotassiation process, the NiO peak remains unchanged, indicating that it is electrochemically inactive during the cycling. As the extraction of K+ progresses, the c axis expands and the ab plane contracts, which can be attributed to the increase in electrostatic repulsion between adjacent oxygen layers and the smaller ion radius caused by Ni2+ → Ni4+.101 To restrain the Jahn–Teller effect, Bai et al. synthesized a P3-type K0.67Mn0.83Ni0.17O2 layered material with an initial discharge capacity of 122 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1.41 It is further confirmed that the incorporation of an appropriate amount of Ni can effectively reduce structural degradation and create more K+ migration channels, thereby ensuring excellent magnification and cycling ability.

3.2.2 Co–Mn-Based materials. 
Generally, the process of large K+ slow migration will bring about a multi-step voltage curve. However, these multiphase transitions are often not conducive to capacity retention during long cycling. According to the one-to-one solid solution concept, Co replaces half of Mn, so Mn gets to a higher +4 state. Thus, P3-K0.54[Co0.5Mn0.5]O2 exhibits a smooth charge and discharge profile and provides a discharge capacity of 120.4 mA h g−1.102 Analytical methods combining ex situ XRD, first-principles calculations, and electrochemical distribution maps reveal the overall K storage mechanism. It is further verified that the less use of Mn4+/Mn3+ redox pairs and the sharing of oxygen with the CoO6 octahedron can greatly suppress the Jahn–Teller deformation and improve the stability of the structure. Furthermore, by changing the compound method of Mn and Co, a lower activation barrier (∼170 meV) than before is needed to maintain the diffusion of K+, thus achieving good rate performance. During the deintercalation of K+, the c lattice parameter of P3-Kx[Co0.5Mn0.5]O2 rises from ∼18.86 Å to ∼19.63 Å, which can be attributed to the O2−–O2− rejection reaction formed as a result of the potassium vacancy. This further results in the (003) peak moving to an angle lower than 2θ in the XRD pattern (Fig. 15b). Furthermore, a new type of P3-K0.45Mn0.5Co0.5O2 using a simple sol–gel method was synthesized as a cathode material for PIBs and non-aqueous potassium-ion hybrid capacitors. There is a two-phase (P3–O3) redox mechanism with redox activity of Mn4+/Mn3+ and Co4+/Co3+, with an average working potential of 2.55 V (vs. K+/K) in P3-K0.45Mn0.5Co0.5O2. When the K content is between 0.26 and 0.56, excellent cycle stability and fast reaction kinetics can be guaranteed. Meanwhile, the charge/discharge curve is smooth because of the presence of binary Mn–Co which hinders the ordered arrangement of K+/vacancies. For PIBs, a high capacity of 140 mA h g−1 and a capacity retention of 80% after 50 cycles can be achieved over a wide voltage range of 1.2–3.9 V.103

Cryptomelane-type KMn8O16 has a unique tunnel structure and can be synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. However, it exhibited fast capacity decay due to the unstable tunnel structure. By adopting the strategy of Co doping with different ratios, much better cycle stability can be obtained while maintaining a unique structure. In all ratio samples, KMn7.6Co0.4O16 showed an initial discharge capacity of 246 mA h g−1 at 10 mA g−1 (Fig. 16).104 The significant improvement in performance can be attributed to the addition of Co, which enhances the structural stability and conductivity of the overall material. The voltage curve of the layered material during K+ insertion/extraction is the key reason for the capacity loss of the PIBs. A solid-state method was adopted to synthesize the rhombohedral P3-K0.48Mn0.4Co0.6O2, presenting a capacity of 64 mA h g−1 at about 3.0 V (vs. K+/K) and the capacity retention exceeds 81% after 180 cycles.40 The study of these Co–Mn-based layered oxides helps us explore the bimetallic system of PIBs on the one hand, and then develop cathode materials with high capacity and good cycle stability on the other.

3.2.3 Fe–Mn and Mg–Mn-based materials. 
In order to further reduce the cost of cathodes and adapt to the migration of large-size K+, the necessary structural design and the use of cheaper metal (Fe and Mg) doping strategies have been widely recognized. During the K+ deintercalation/intercalation process, the large structural changes and deformations of the layered material and severe side effects with the electrolyte further reduce the capacity and cycle stability. The interconnected K0.7Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 nanowire skeleton structure was synthesized for the first time and exhibited an ultra-high initial discharge capacity of 178 mA h g−1. The special three-dimensional network structure provides a channel for K+ diffusion and electron transmission (Fig. 17). In addition, the capacity of the full battery assembled with soft carbon as the anode can be maintained at 76% of the original capacity after 250 cycles.105 Besides, P2-K0.65Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 (P2-KFMO) microspheres formed by primary particle self-assembly were prepared by a modified solvent-thermal method. Thanks to the unique microsphere structure and the stable electrolyte mesophase formed during K+ migration, P2-KFMO delivers a high reversible capacity of 151 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1, and shows 78% capacity retention after 350 cycles. Moreover, a full battery system was built with hard carbon as the counter electrode, and it showed good cycle stability (over 80% capacity retention after 100 cycles).106 To explore the optimal Fe substitution ratio for the cathode reaction, a series of P3-K0.45Mn1−xFexO2 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) were fabricated by the solid-state method. K0.45Mn0.8Fe0.2O2 exhibited the best electrochemical performance. The discharge capacity is up to 106.2 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1, and the capacity retention after 100 cycles is 77.3%.107 It has been verified by ex situ XRD that appropriate Fe doping can improve the structural stability of K0.45Mn1−xFexO2.

Mg is often used as a dopant due to its electrochemical inertness. In the case of LTMOs, Mg is often used to adjust the layered structure to improve electrochemical performance. For example, Mg is used as an additive to partially replace Ni to form Na0.67Mn0.67Ni0.33−xMgxO2, which can inhibit the P2–O2 phase transition and thus improve cycle stability.93 The partial replacement of inactive Mg+ in Na2/3[Mg0.28Mn0.72]O2 also causes an additional increase in specific capacity.108 A novel potassium-deficient layered P3-K0.45Mn0.9Mg0.1O2 was developed by the solid-phase reaction, and the structural stability was verified by ex situ XRD and SEM results.109 Furthermore, referring to the relevant reports of LiMn1−yMO2 and NaxMn1−yMO2 applied to LIBs and SIBs,110–112 respectively, the performance of the KxMn1−yMyO2 material depended largely on the phase structure, compound, and microstructure.25 Based on the unique layered structure and effective Mg doping strategy, K0.7Mn0.7Mg0.3O2 particles showed a high reversible capacity of 144.5 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1 and a high capacity retention of 82.5% after 400 cycles. Moreover, the full battery using a K0.7Mn0.7Mg0.3O2 cathode and hard carbon anode also demonstrated superior properties (a capacity of 73.5 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1).113 For H-K0.7MnO2, a phase transition from H-K0.7MnO2 to P3-K0.48Mn0.94O2 occurs during charging. During the discharge, an irreversible diffraction peak appears at ∼25.1°, indicating that this phase transformation is not totally reversible. However, for H-K0.7Mn0.7Mg0.3O2, this phase transition is totally reversible even at a high cut-off voltage of 4.0 V. This ex situ XRD and the corresponding dQ/dV curves indicate that the incorporation of Mg can inhibit the irreversible phase transition and improve the structural stability.

3.3 Multi-metal-based materials
Multi-metal-based materials used as cathodes for PIBs mainly include some ternary materials. As far as we know, ternary materials with a layered structure such as LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2,114 LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2,115 Li[Ni1−x−yCoxMny]O2,116 Na[Ni0.61Co0.12Mn0.27]O2 (ref. 117) and Na0.67[Ni0.4Co0.2Mn0.4]O2 (ref. 118) have been widely studied in LIBs and SIBs. Especially in LIBs, NCM series materials have been considered as the most up-and-coming cathode materials for new generation batteries. However, the studies of potassium-containing ternary cathode materials in PIBs are still in the preliminary stage, and further development research is needed. Co-precipitation is a common method for preparing ternary cathode materials. As a new cathode material for PIBs, K0.67Ni0.17Co0.17Mn0.66O2 is often synthesized by a co-precipitation-assisted solid-phase method.119 As seen in Fig. 18, the redox reactions between Mn3+/Mn4+ and Ni2+/Ni4+ correspond to two redox pairs of 3.71/3.45 V and 2.47/2.33 V, respectively. Subsequently, the anode peak shifts to 3.73 V from 3.81 V, indicating an enhanced reaction kinetics. Also, the overlapping CV curves show that the K+ insertion/extraction process is highly reversible. By studying the effect of incorporating different amounts of Na on the electrochemical performance of K0.67−xNaxNi0.17Co0.17Mn0.66O2 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5), it is found that the P3/P2-K0.37Na0.3Ni0.17Co0.17Mn0.66O2 electrode exhibits better reversible capacities than P3-K0.67Ni0.17Co0.17Mn0.66O2, indicating that incorporation of an appropriate amount of Na can activate the crystal structure from the single phase to the dual-phase.120 Too much Na+ will limit the migration of K+, so the ratio should be controlled within a reasonable range to achieve better performance.

Although potassium (K) has a larger atomic weight than lithium (Li), it has a lower redox potential in organic solvents. Therefore, when combined with a suitable anode electrode, PIBs can maintain high-voltage features.12,121 Exploring high-voltage cathode materials is one of the development trends of PIBs. Some monometallic potassium-based layered oxides such as K0.6CoO2 and K0.5MnO2 tend to exhibit high reversible capacity and fast kinetics.18,19 However, in comparison with lithium-based analogues, these results are mostly based on lower operating voltage, reducing the practicality of the material.122 Recently, some multi-metal based layered oxides such as K2/3Ni1/6Co1/6Mn2/3O2 (ref. 119) and P2-K2/3Ni1/3Co1/3Te1/3O2 (ref. 123) have been reported to have better electrochemical performance than the parent KxCoO2 and KxMnO2. Due to the presence of Ni2+/Ni4+ redox pairs, nickel-based metals should inherently have a higher cut-off voltage.124 K2/3Ni1/3Co1/3Te1/3O2 possesses a unique layered honeycomb skeleton structure upon introducing Te element (Fig. 19). During the extraction of K+, several small peaks appear in the 2.8–3.8 V voltage range, representing the order of K+/vacancies.125 In addition, the main redox peak at around 4.3 V further reveals that K2/3Ni1/3Co1/3Te1/3O2 is an available cathode material for high-voltage PIBs.

The electrochemical ion exchange method is another common method for preparing layered multi-metal-based oxides in addition to the co-precipitation method. The Na0.9Cr0.9Ru0.1O2 fabricated in this method exhibits a large specific capacity (100.6 mA h g−1) and excellent rate performance (with a capacity retention of 80.1% after 300 cycles at 0.5C and 81.2% after 500 cycles at 5C).126 When discharged to 1.5 V, the insertion of K+ causes the transformation of the P′3 single phase to a P3 and O3 dual-phase, resulting in the lengthening of the layer spacing. On the other hand, the K+ diffusion path is a direct diffusion process from prism to prism. For the above reasons, the diffusion coefficient of K+ (10−13 to 10−12 cm2 s−1) during intercalation is comparable to or higher than that of Na+ (10−14 to 10−12 cm2 s−1), which can be derived from the constant current galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). Using electrochemical ion exchange, another P2-K0.75[Mn0.8Ni0.1Fe0.1]O2 electrode can handle a considerable amount of K+ without a multi-phase transition (∼0.5 mol), ensuring a high reversible capacity of 110 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. In addition, the full battery is assembled with a hardened carbon anode for excellent stability up to 1000 cycles.42 According to the bond valence sum (BVS) energy diagram (Fig. 20a) of P2-K0.75[Mn0.8Ni0.1Fe0.1]O2, K+ has enough two-dimensional diffusion paths between MO6 octahedra (M: Fe, Ni, Mn), thus avoiding the occurrence of multiphase transformation. During charging, the (002) hex and (004) hex diffraction lines gradually evolved to low angles, while the (100) hex and (103) hex diffraction lines tended to higher angles (Fig. 20b). All diffraction peak shifts are reversible when discharging. This highly reversible structural evolution validates the excellent electrochemical performance of P2-K0.75[Mn0.8Ni0.1Fe0.1]O2 (Fig. 21a–e). Similarly, to overcome the problems of capacity reduction and structural degradation of Mn-based layered cathode materials, P3-K0.5[Mn0.8Fe0.1Ni0.1]O2 was synthesized by the strategy of partial replacement of Mn3+ through Fe3+ and Ni2+. By comparing the integral spin moments of Ni, Fe, and Mn in P3-K0.75[Mn0.8Fe0.1Ni0.1]O2 and O3-K0.25[Mn0.8Fe0.1Ni0.1]O2, the redox reactions of each transition metal in Kx[Mn0.8Fe0.1Ni0.1]O2 in the K+ de-intercalation process were determined. The calculation results show that the transition metal ions in P3-K0.75[Mn0.8Fe0.1Ni0.1]O2 can provide enough electrons to promote the release of K+ from the structure, leading to a high reversible capacity (120 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1).43

4. Issues and challenges
We have described the latest achievement of LTMO cathode materials for PIBs and given some conclusions. PIBs are a potential substitute for LIBs. Potassium has richer natural reserves than lithium. And the mobility of K+ is higher. Potassium does not easily react with aluminum as a current collector. Moreover, the layered structure of LTMOs promotes electrochemical performance. However, the application of LTMO cathode materials and PIBs still faces many issues and challenges, which are mainly as follows:
(i) Limited energy density. Although the working voltage of PIBs is similar to that of lithium batteries, the larger ion radius of potassium and the higher atomic weight of potassium will reduce the weight and volume energy density. The layered transition metal oxide can only provide a limited volume of energy to assist in increasing the energy density of the potassium ion battery, but the unstable charging structure of the material at high voltage will cause the capacity fading.
(ii) Poor long cycle stability. The layered structure of LTMOs provides potassiation/depotassiation space for K+, which can effectively alleviate the volume change caused by K+. However, the mechanism of layer sliding in the adjacent oxygen layers can be characterized as the features in the potential profile induced high coulombic repulsion at lower K content. These procedures are coupled with large volume changes and are therefore partially irreversible, which accounts for the observed capacity fade in this potential range. In addition, the low electrochemical potential of K+/K is prone to oxidation reactions, and the layered structure enhances the contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte. Therefore, the solvent of the electrolyte is easily reduced on the electrode surface, causing serious side reactions to consume the electrolyte.
(iii) Structural design optimization. Currently, LTMOs are widely studied in LIBs and SIBs, providing theoretical support for LTMOs in PIBs. The layered structure is also mainly based on the P2-type, P3-type, and O3-type. Even now, there is still much room for optimization and improvement in the structural design of materials. For one thing, the aim of developing multi-metal-based materials is to obtain a more stable material structure, which contributes to reducing the local mirror image deformation of the material's structure and some irreversible structural distortions. For another, the material's structure is optimized for building composite materials with other systems or coating on the surface. The above strategies are all good attempts.
Generally, the existing LTMO cathode materials still cannot meet people's needs in actual battery applications. However, research on cathode materials has provided good strategies for further improvement. PIBs using LTMOs are expected to replace LIBs as a new type of commercial product, due to the fact that LTMO cathode materials show huge commercial prospects.
5. Prospects
As mentioned above, focusing on structural stability and fast dynamics under the premise of ensuring safety is the key to the development of high-voltage LTMO cathode materials for PIBs. However, there are still lots of problems in practical application. Much work still needs to be done. Improvements should give priority to energy density, cycle stability, safety, and structural changes.
In order to reduce the deterioration of the structure, the valence of Mn ions can be appropriately increased to reduce the destructive effect of the Jahn–Teller distortion in the octahedron, thereby reducing the structural transformation during the extraction/insertion process of K+, and avoiding the disorder of the crystal structure. In addition, a reasonably designed redox pair combination (e.g. Fe3+/4+ and Mn3.6+/4+) contributes to the energy density. Note that accidental oxidation and decomposition of the electrolyte may occur during the charging process. The excellent electrochemical performance is produced by the structural stability related to the single-phase reaction when K+ is extracted/inserted into the main structure. However, in a highly disabled state, the diffusion of potassium ions from the structure will inevitably be accompanied by a variety of phase transitions, resulting in energy loss during cycling. In view of this situation, improvements can be made in the following aspects: (i) forming a specific solid solution to reduce the lattice parameters can alleviate these multiphase transitions, thereby retaining the ultimate capacity for extended periods; (ii) making double transition metals coexist in the transition metal layer is beneficial to alleviate the degree of irreversible multiphase transition and improve the stability of the structure; (iii) a relatively small substitution (20%) at the transition metal site can improve the cycle stability during the insertion and extraction of potassium ions. In summary, the design idea of a dual-coordination strategy with a dual-level structure and doping elements may provide an effective way to develop advanced LTMO cathode materials.
For the fast dynamics, the activation barrier should be as low as possible to promote the rapid diffusion of potassium ions in the crystal structure, and the structural design should be reasonable to achieve a larger diffusion path. Furthermore, when cycling at a high potential, the stable catholyte mesophase film formed by the carbonate solvent can effectively prevent the negative reaction between the electrolyte and the active material. Therefore, the formation of a stable catholyte mesophase film by the adaptation between the cathode material and the electrolyte is of great significance to the stability and rapid kinetics of electrochemistry.
The integral electrochemical performance is an essential feature of PIBs, but the production cost is also a key factor. Balancing the relationship between them is still a challenge and is a key link to the commercialization of PIBs. In this regard, cheap metals and simple synthesis methods are welcome to reduce the cost. Till now, Mn-based cathode materials have become a preferred cathode owing to the low cost and suitable electrochemical properties. In addition, it can help increase the limited energy density by adjusting the structure type, introducing heteroatoms, and other technical means. Combining the need for low cost, chemical/thermal stability, and electrochemical performance, it is necessary to develop the most suitable elemental composition and ratio to yield an environmentally friendly cathode material for PIBs which is suitable for large-scale energy storage applications.
In the future, more efforts should be made to meet these requirements, whether in innovative structural design methods or in studying the mechanisms of structural evolution during the cycling. In terms of structural design, in addition to the most popular and effective micro/nanocomposite materials with other systems, and coating the surface with a protective layer, we should also construct primary/secondary hierarchical structures to stabilize the surface passivation. Meanwhile, they can be further processed for micro-hole formation to adapt to volume changes to ensure stability during long cycling.127 For example, a new type of AlF3 coated K1.39Mn3O6 was developed as a cathode material for PIBs, and it showed a high reversible capacity.53 Gao et al. demonstrated that the interlayer water was capable of acting as a structural support and buffer during K+ extraction and reinsertion to facilitate the K+ diffusion.128 As for the reaction mechanism, an in-depth study of the relationship between battery performance and structural evolution should be carried out to accelerate the commercialization of PIBs. Advanced in situ measurement techniques (e.g. in situ TEM, XRD, and FTIR) combined with first-principles calculations should be applied to further precisely explore the real reaction mechanism and crystal structure evolution during the charge/discharge cycling. They can also foresee and solve existing problems, such as the irreversible capacity loss in the initial cycle. To this end, efforts should be made to enhance the test combination between the cathode material and other parts of PIBs including the anode material, electrolyte additives, binders, etc. Regardless of the challenges that still need to be overcome, we believe that the greater application of LTMOs in PIBs will be proven at the industrial level, which has the potential to promote the widespread application of low-cost PIBs for energy storage systems in the near future.
