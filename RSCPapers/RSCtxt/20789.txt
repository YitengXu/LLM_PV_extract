    , Accepted 4th March 2023First published on 7th March 2023AbstractHarvesting and converting solar energy is a promising strategy for addressing energy and environmental crises. To achieve this strategy, numerous semiconductors and heterojunctions have been explored and developed. However, the low utilization rates of light and low charge separation efficiency are still major drawbacks limiting its development. The structure and electron transfer paths of semiconductor heterojunctions are important for solar energy harvesting and conversion. A one-dimensional hollow structure has excellent light scattering and reflection effects that can improve the harvesting and conversion of solar energy. Furthermore, S-scheme has recently become a hot topic of research because of its ability to weed out useless photoelectrons and holes while retaining powerful ones. In this study, a hollow Ni2P/TiO2 S-scheme heterojunction was designed to harvest solar energy and enhance the photoelectric effect. The Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction has excellent photoelectric separation effects, which are confirmed by photoelectrochemical characterization results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Consequently, the hollow Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction provides good photocathodic protection under visible light irradiation, and the surface potential of 304ss coupled with the Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction decreases to −0.83 V in a 3.5% NaCl solution. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) shows that the 3D morphology and roughness of the 304ss surface changes slightly with the photocathodic protection of the Ni2P/TiO2 composite. Based on the band matching and electron spin resonance (ESR) experimental results, the S-scheme interfacial charge transfer path was confirmed. This study demonstrates the potential of the Ni2P/TiO2 S-scheme heterojunction for photocathodic protection and can inspire future exploration of the S-scheme heterojunction for photocathodic protection.
1. Introduction
Currently, industrial development relies heavily on fossil fuels; however, the consumption depletion of limited fossil fuels threatens human development.1,2 Moreover, the overuse of fossil fuels has caused serious environmental and energy problems. It is imperative to develop and utilize green energy to face this challenge. At present, solar energy is considered to be an abundant and sustainable green energy.3–5 The photoelectric effect of semiconductors is a promising strategy for converting solar energy into sustainable energy.6 Since Honda and Fujishima discovered electrochemical photolysis of water on a semiconductor electrode in 1972,7 the catalytic science of converting solar energy by semiconductors has been explored and developed rapidly, such as photocatalytic degradation,8–11 photocatalytic hydrogen production,12–14 and photocathodic protection.15–17 However, photocatalysis is still difficult to use widely in practice. The main challenge is low sunlight capture and the separation of photoelectrons and holes, especially for single-semiconductor.18 The heterostructure construction and proper structural design of semiconductor materials are effective strategies for solving the above problems.19–21
In the past few decades, mainstream type-II heterojunctions have been explored to improve the photoelectric performance of semiconductors. However, the charge-transfer path of type-II heterojunctions leads to a decrease in the redox capacity of the catalyst. Moreover, from a dynamic viewpoint, electrostatic repulsion between type-II heterojunctions prevents further charge transfer. This makes the type-II heterojunction model controversial.
In recent years, a new step-scheme (S-scheme) heterojunction is proposed.22,23 The S-scheme comprises two n-type semiconductors: oxidation and reduction semiconductors. When two semiconductors come into contact, the Fermi level restructures and creates a built-in electric field that facilitates charge transfer. In addition, when exposed to light, the photogenerated electrons of the oxidized semiconductor and the holes of the reduced semiconductor recombine at the contact interface. Moreover, holes with strong oxidizing capacity and electrons with reducing capacity are retained at oxidation and reduction semiconductors, respectively. This is very good for charge separation and improves the dynamics of the redox reaction.
The morphology of a semiconductor is closely related to its photoelectric conversion efficiencies.24 A hollow structure with a high light-harvest efficiency, high surface area and rapid electron transfer can enhance the photoelectric effect of semiconductors.25–27 TiO2 nanotubes have a unique hollow tubular shape, which can enhance light absorption and utilization through light scattering and reflection.28 In addition, compared to nanoparticles, nanonetworks and nanospheres, TiO2 nanotubes can enhance the rapid separation of photogenerated carriers.29–31 However, TiO2 can only capture and convert UV light (only 5% of solar energy), and photogenerated electrons and holes are easily recombined.32–34 Therefore, to further enhance solar energy capture and the utilization of the TiO2, it is particularly important to properly use heterojunctions based on the hollow structures of TiO2.
Herein, S-scheme heterojunction construction and excellent structural design strategies are adopted to enhance the photoelectric effect. Specifically, TiO2 nanotubes with hollow structures and Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction were obtained by anodic oxidation and hydrothermal methods, respectively. The morphology, structure and material composition of the Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction were analyzed, and light absorption performance and photoelectric performance thereof were investigated. The Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction has excellent photoelectric separation effects, which are confirmed by photoelectrochemical characterization results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. For proof-of-concept demonstrations, the Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction was used as a photoanode to capture visible light to obtain photogenerated electrons and achieve photogenerated cathodic protection for 304ss.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of hollow TiO2 nanotubes by anodic oxidation
The hollow TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2 NTs) were prepared using a simple anodic oxidation method, as in our previous studies.35,36 The typical preparation process was finished by cutting a commercial Ti plate into pieces with a size of 10 mm × 40 mm × 0.3 mm, washing these pieces several times in ultrasonic cleaner ethanol and deionized water, and chemical polishing to remove oxides on the surface of the Ti piece to obtain cleaned Ti piece. The polishing solution contained 3.56 wt% NH4F, 41.37 vol% HNO3, and 41.37 vol% H2O2. Then, the cleaned Ti piece was anodized for 1 hour at 20 V in an electrolyte of a two-electrode system, where the Ti piece acted as a working electrode and a Pt having a size of 2 cm × 2 cm acted as a counter electrode. The electrolyte contained 0.55 wt% NH4F, 9.09 vol% H2O, and 90.91 vol% ethylene glycol. Finally, the anodized Ti piece was annealed at 450 °C for 2 h to obtain hollow TiO2 NTs.
2.2 Preparation of the hollow Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction
A hollow Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction was prepared using a low-temperature hydrothermal method. First, a certain amount of red phosphorus, NiCl2·6H2O, ascorbic acid (AC) and poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) (1.89:1.39:2:1 mass ratio) are weighed containing water (60 mL) in a beaker and dissolved by a magnetic stirrer to obtain a precursor solution. Subsequently, the precursor solution was transferred to a stainless steel reactor (100 mL) containing hollow TiO2 NTs and reacted by heating it in the air at 140 °C for 12 h to obtain a composite photoanode sample. After the reaction finished, the sample was naturally cooled to room temperature and washed several times with deionized water. Then, the sample was vacuum dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The composite photoanode is denoted as Ni2P/TiO2-x, where x represents the concentration of Ni2+ in the precursor solution, which has a unit of mmol. In this experiment, Ni2+concentrations of 1 mmol, 15 mmol and 30 mmol were adopted in the samples Ni2P/TiO2-1, Ni2P/TiO2-15 and Ni2P/TiO2-30, respectively.
2.3 Characterization methods
The surface morphology and hollow structure of the hollow TiO2 NTs and the Ni2P/TiO2 composite were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, S-4800, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV and transmission electron microscopy (TEM JEM-2100F, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The element types and contents at various points in the prepared sample section were characterized by line scanning using TEM. The distribution of elements on the entire surface of the sample was characterized by mapping scanning using X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford, UK). The crystal structure of the sample was explored using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8ADVANCE, Germany). The element composition and valence state on the surface of the prepared samples were analyzed and characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Escalab 250Xi, USA). Raman spectra of the prepared samples were investigated using a confocal Raman microscope (Renishaw inVia MZ20-FC, UK). The light absorption performance of the sample was tested and analyzed using UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS, Hitachi U-3900H, Japan). The Tauc plot method was used to obtain a band gap of the sample, where the wavelength range used in the test method was 200–800 nm, with barium sulfate as a reference material. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of the prepared samples were measured using Bruker (EMX Plus).
2.4 Photoelectric and photoelectrochemical performance measurements
Photoluminescence spectra were used to qualitatively characterize the photoelectric separation efficiency of the samples, where the incident light was 375 nm (PL, Edinburgh FLs980, UK). Electrochemical data were collected with an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E, Shanghai Chen Hua, China). The photoinduced volt–ampere characteristic curve (i–V), Mott–Schottky curve, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were tested with a three-electrode system. In this system, the working electrode (WE) was the TiO2 NTs or Ni2P/TiO2 composite, the counter electrode (CE, Pt) was platinum with an area of 2 × 2 cm2, the reference electrode was a saturated calomel electrode (RE, SCE), and the electrolyte was a 0.1 m L−1 Na2SO4 solution; the device is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The test AC voltage amplitude of EIS was 10 mV (relative to the OCP), and its frequency range was 10−2–105 Hz without light. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the open-circuit potential (OCP) and photocurrent density over time (j–t) tests adopted the test equipment and conditions that we worked on before using a double electrolytic cell and a three-electrode system under intermittent simulated sunlight. A 300 W high-pressure xenon lamp (PLS-SXE 300C, Beijing Perfectlight, China) equipped with a 420 nm filter simulated visible light, and the light intensity was 320 mW cm−2. The double electrolytic cell consisted of a corrosion cell and a photoanode cell connected by a Nafion membrane. The corrosion cell contained a 3.5% NaCl solution, and the photoanode cell contained 0.1 mol L−1 Na2S and 0.2 mol L−1 NaOH solutions. During the OCP test, the 304ss electrode and the sample were connected by copper wires as the WEs, and they were placed in the corrosion and photoanode cells, respectively. The RE and CE were placed in the corrosion cells. In the j–t test, to avoid the influence of polarization on the photocurrent test, the 304ss electrode was connected to the ground wire interface (GNE) of the electrochemical workstation, with the RE port connected to the CE port. Then, the sample was used as a working electrode. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) was used to characterize the surface of the 304ss electrode before and after photocathodic protection to obtain 3D images and surface roughness information to intuitively understand the photocathodic protection of the prepared samples.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and morphological characterizations
The Ni2P/TiO2 composite was obtained using a two-step method. First, hollow TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2 NTs) were obtained using the anodic oxidation method. Afterwards, the Ni2P/TiO2 composite was prepared based on hollow TiO2 NTs using the low-temperature hydrothermal method. The preparation process is shown in Fig. 1(a).
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic of the preparation of hollow Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction; (b) SEM images of the hollow TiO2 NTs; (c)–(e) SEM images of Ni2P/TiO2-1, Ni2P/TiO2-15; (f)–(h), and (i) elemental mapping of P, Ni, O, and Ti of Ni2P/TiO2-1. 
SEM was used to investigate the morphologies and sizes of the hollow TiO2 NTs and the Ni2P/TiO2 composites. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the hollow TiO2 NTs were prepared by anodization, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The hollow TiO2 NTs were arranged neatly and uniformly to form a one-dimensional hollow structure. The tubes had an average length of about 60.8 nm and an average inner diameter of about 650 nm, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Fig. 1(c)–(e) shows the surface topography of the Ni2P/TiO2 composite prepared by applying the hydrothermal method. In Ni2P/TiO2-1 and Ni2P/TiO2-15, it can be observed that a small amount of Ni2P nanoparticles was randomly distributed in the hollow TiO2 NTs. In addition, the elemental mapping of Ni2P/TiO2 composites shows that P and Ni were uniformly distributed on the surface of the hollow TiO2 NTs in a circular form (Fig. 1(f)–(i)). Numerous thin films formed by the Ni2P on the surface of the sample Ni2P/TiO2-30 caused the disappearance of many TiO2 NTs hollow structures (Fig. S4, ESI†). The above results show that the samples Ni2P/TiO2-1 and Ni2P/TiO2-15 have hollow structures. According to relevant studies, the hollow heterojunction can lead to an effective increase in light absorption and capture ability and thus may induce fast electron transport.25,37–39 These results show that Ni2P nanoparticles developed on hollow TiO2 NTs using the hydrothermal method can be expected to further enhance the photoelectric effect of TiO2.
Furthermore, TEM images and high-resolution TEM images of Ni2P/TiO2-15 were collected. Fig. 2(a) and (e) show the hollow tubular structure and nozzle morphology of Ni2P/TiO2-15, respectively. In addition, a single Ni2P/TiO2-15 nanotube shows a distinct wall boundary, which clearly indicates that it has a hollow structure, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Consistent with the results obtained by SEM, the inner diameter, length and thickness of the nanotubes are about 60, 650, and 10 nm, respectively. Fig. S6(a)–(e) (ESI†) shows the TEM image of Ni2P/TiO2-15 and the corresponding surface scanning map. The distribution of Ti, O, P and Ni elements presents a hollow tubular shape, and P and Ni are uniformly distributed across the entire nanotube. Moreover, the cross section line scanning of the Ni2P/TiO2-15 nanotube clearly showed that Ni and P elements were evenly distributed on the TiO2 nanotube wall, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Notably, many obvious rod-like granular distribution patterns are not found on the inner wall of TiO2 NTs. The possible reason is that the supply of precursor liquid in the tube hindered the growth of Ni2P nanoparticles. A detailed analysis of the Ni2P/TiO2-15 surface scanning and line scanning is provided in Note S1 (ESI†).

Fig. 2(b) shows a high-resolution image of the Ni2P/TiO2-15, in which the c and d areas are magnified to obtain a clear lattice image. The lattices with a plane spacing of 0.169 nm correspond to the {300} plane of the Ni2P (JCPDS no. 03-0953), as shown in Fig. 2(c). Fig. 2(d) shows the plane spacing of 0.352 nm that corresponds to the {101} plane of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1272).40Fig. 2(f) depicts a high-resolution image of the Ni2P/TiO2-15 nozzle, and it can be clearly observed that Ni2P/TiO2-15 is a tubular shape with a certain wall thickness. Fig. 2(g) and (h) show enlarged planes compared to (f). The plane spacing of 0.351 nm matched well with the {101} plane of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS no. 89-4921), as shown in Fig. 2(g). Moreover, Fig. 2(h) shows a plane spacing of 0.221 nm that matched well with the {111} plane of the Ni2P. In addition, it can be clearly observed that the Ni2P nanoparticles grow near the nozzle and the inner wall of the TiO2 nanotube, which agrees with the SEM results.

Fig. 2(i) shows a comparison diagram of the XRD results of the Ni2P/TiO2-15 and standard PDF card, where 2θ = 35.0°, 38.4°, 40.1°, 53.0°, 70.6° and 76.2°, belonging to diffraction peaks of Ti in Ti substrate (JCPDS no. 44–1294). The peaks at the 2θ values of 25.3°, 48.1° and 82.6° were attributed to the (101), (200) and (224), respectively, crystal faces of the anatase TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1272), indicating that the anatase TiO2 have been successfully formed on the Ti substrate after the anodizing and annealing at 450 °C. In addition, the peaks at 2θ = 40.7°, 44.5°, 47.3°, 54.2°, and 54.9° corresponded to the (111), (201), (210), (300) and (211) crystal planes of the Ni2P (JCPDS no. 03-0953), respectively. The anatase TiO2 (101), Ni2P (111) and Ni2P (300) agreed with the results obtained by the high-resolution TEM, which indicated that the Ni2P/TiO2 composites could successfully be prepared using the hydrothermal method. Fig. 2(j) shows the Raman spectra of the TiO2 NTs and the Ni2P/TiO2 composites. The peaks appearing at 147, 197, 392, 513, and 635 cm−1 can be attributed to the anatase phase TiO2.41–43 Furthermore, the Raman spectra of the Ni2P/TiO2 composites maintained similar peaks to TiO2, which indicated that the crystallites of TiO2 crystallites were unchanged in the Ni2P/TiO2 composites. In addition, no significant Ni2P has been observed in Ni2P/TiO2 composites, which may be related to low Ni2P content and molecular symmetry.41,42 The Ni2P/TiO2-15 sample was analyzed by XPS. The full-scale XPS spectra revealed the presence of Ti, O, Ni and P elements in Ni2P/TiO2-15. In addition, there are no other impure elements (Fig. S8(a), ESI†). In the Ni 2p spectrum, the binding energies of 853.3 eV and 870.5 eV corresponded to Niδ+ (0 < δ < 2)44–46 of Ni2P, as shown in Fig. S8(b) (ESI†). A set of peaks with binding energies of 856.0 eV and 874.0 eV corresponded to the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 orbitals of Ni2+, respectively. In addition, the peaks with binding energies of 862.0 eV and 879.8 eV corresponded to the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 orbital satellite peaks of Ni2+ (denoted as “sat”), respectively. In the P 2p XPS spectrum, the binding energy of 129.9 eV belonged to Pδ− in Ni2P,45–47 as shown in Fig. S8(c) (ESI†). The binding energy of 133.0 eV was attributed to the P in phosphate,44–46 which may have resulted from the sample being oxidized when exposed to air.48,49 In addition, EDS spectra showed that the surface of the Ni2P/TiO2 composites included P, Ni, O and Ti elements (Fig. S9, ESI†). The atomic percentages of surface elements of all samples basically agree with the stoichiometry of their compounds, and P and Ni elements increase with the increase in the concentration of P and Ni sources in the reaction solution, which agrees with the SEM observation results (Table S1, ESI†). Thus, XRD, Raman, XPS and EDS results affirmed that Ni2P/TiO2 composites were successfully prepared using the hydrothermal method.
3.2 Optical absorption properties analysis
The light absorption of Ni2P, TiO2 NTs and Ni2P/TiO2 composites was analyzed by the UV-Vis DRS, as shown in Fig. 3(a). It can be observed that the absorption capacities of hollow TiO2 NTs and Ni2P/TiO2-1 were basically the same in the visible light region. This result showed that the growth of a small amount of Ni2P on hollow TiO2 NTs provided no significant improvement in light absorption performance. Compared with hollow TiO2 NTs and Ni2P/TiO2-1, the absorption performance of Ni2P/TiO2-15 and Ni2P/TiO2-30 in the visible light region was significantly enhanced. Moreover, the light absorption edge clearly redshifted, indicating that a certain amount of narrowband Ni2P loaded on TiO2 could effectively improve its light absorption. Fig. 3(b) shows the curve of the ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance absorption spectrum data transformed by the Kubelka–Munk equation for Ni2P, hollow TiO2 NTs and sample Ni2P/TiO2-15.50–52 The band gaps (Eg) are calculated using the following equation:(αhν)2 = A(hν − Eg),where α is the absorption coefficient, h, ν, and A are Planck's constant, the frequency of light, and a constant, respectively. Eg is the bandgap. As can be seen, the Eg of Ni2P, hollow TiO2 NTs and Ni2P/TiO2-15 were 1.0 eV, 3.28 eV and 3.1 eV, respectively. To further confirm the above experimental results, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out. Fig. 3(c)–(h) shows the band structures and density of state (DOS) of the TiO2, Ni2P and Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction. The results show that TiO2, Ni2P and Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction are direct bandgap semiconductors with bandgap widths of 3.054, 0.9627 eV and 1.5 eV, respectively. The values obtained in the DFT calculation are smaller than those obtained in the experimental DRS owing to the calculation defect.53,54 These data suggest that Ni2P loaded on the TiO2 plays a critical role in harvesting visible light, which is expected to enhance the photoelectric effect.

3.3 Photoelectric and photoelectrochemical performance analyses
PL is an effective method for evaluating the photoelectric separation efficiency of semiconductor materials. A part of the photocarriers generated by the semiconductor after being exposed to light recombines and emits various wavelengths of fluorescence. Generally, a higher intensity of the PL peak indicates a higher degree of photogenerated carrier recombination of the semiconductor material.55,56 The PL of the TiO2 NT and Ni2P/TiO2 composites was carried out, and the results are shown in Fig. 4(a). In the TiO2 NTs, strong fluorescence emission peaks existed at around 420 and 440 nm. Moreover, it could be observed that the Ni2P/TiO2 composite also had similar emission peaks. However, the peak intensity was clearly weaker than that of the hollow TiO2 NTs. This result indicates that the Ni2P/TiO2 composites effectively improved the separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers and significantly reduced the recombination of photogenerated electrons with holes. The peak intensities showed a decreasing trend from TiO2 NTs, Ni2P/TiO2-1, Ni2P/TiO2-30 to Ni2P/TiO2-15, indicating that Ni2P/TiO2-15 had better photoelectric separation efficiency. Furthermore, time-resolved transient PL decay spectra (TRPL) are detected, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The decay curve is fitted with a double-exponential formula. The carrier average life is calculated using the following equation:  
 Fig. 4  (a) PL spectra for the hollow TiO2 NT and Ni2P/TiO2 composites; (b) TRPL of hollow TiO2 NT and Ni2P/TiO2 composites; (c) photoinduced i–V curves of hollow TiO2 NT and Ni2P/TiO2 composites. 
The results show that the Ni2P/TiO2 composites exhibit a longer average lifetime (Ni2P/TiO2-1: 8.75 ns, Ni2P/TiO2-15: 14.00 ns, Ni2P/TiO2-30: 9.46 ns) than that of TiO2 NTs (8.65 ns), which indicates that the former can effectively promote the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes. Detailed fitting results are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). Moreover, the EIS Nyquist plots further confirmed this result. The impedance of the TiO2 NTs was significantly greater than that of the composite samples, which shows that the photogenerated electrons and holes of Ni2P/TiO2 composite are effectively separated57(Fig. S10, ESI†). Additionally, the i–V curves were used to further investigate the photoelectric separation efficiency of the samples, as shown in Fig. 4(c). The results show that the photocurrent of the Ni2P/TiO2 composite samples was significantly stronger than that of the TiO2 NTs. This proved that the composites had better photoelectric separation effects than TiO2 NTs. In addition, Ni2P/TiO2-15 exhibited the strongest photocurrent, which agrees with the results obtained by PL spectroscopy. Thus far, the above analysis showed that the Ni2P and TiO2 composites had better photoelectric separation efficiency.
3.4 Charge transfer mechanism of the Ni2P/TiO2 composite
To get more insight into the effect of the photoelectric separation of the Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction, the electrostatic potentials were calculated, and the work functions (φ) were confirmed as φ = Evac − EF.54Evac and EF are the electrostatic potentials of vacuum energy and Fermi energy levels, respectively. The results showed that the Fermi level of the Ni2P (3.46 eV) is higher than that of the TiO2 (5.10 eV) (Fig. 5(a) and (b)). Therefore, when the Ni2P contact with the TiO2, the electrons in Ni2P were transferred to TiO2, eventually reaching equilibrium (4.53 eV) (vs. vacuum) (Fig. 5(c)). Furthermore, the band structure of TiO2, Ni2P and Ni2P/TiO2 were analyzed by Mott–Schottky curves, as shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). As observed from the slope of the tangent line of the Mott–Schottky curve, all samples exhibit the characteristics of n-type semiconductors owing to the positive slope. Regarding TiO2 NTs, the results agreed with previous studies.58 The Ni2P/TiO2 composite was an n-type semiconductor, indicating that TiO2 and Ni2P,59 which are both n-type semiconductors, still exhibited the characteristics of n-type semiconductors after being combined. Moreover, the Fermi energy levels of TiO2, Ni2P and Ni2P/TiO2 are −0.31 vs. SCE (equal to −0.068 V vs. NHE), −0.97 vs. SCE (equal to −0.728 V vs. NHE) and −0.81 V vs. SCE (equal to −0.568 V vs. NHE), respectively. Because of the solvation effect, the Fermi level measured in the experiment is low (Table S3, ESI†), which does not affect the charge transfer trend.60 Consequently, the Ni2P and TiO2 would be positively and negatively charged, respectively, resulting in the formation of an internal electric field (IEF) and band edge bending (Fig. 5(d) and (e)). The IEF and band edge bending contributed to the recombination of invalid electrons with holes at the heterogeneous interface and retained the electrons and holes with strong reduction and oxidation abilities.

To investigate the location of the energy band of the TiO2 and Ni2P, VB-XPS was utilized combined with the results of DRS. The corresponding EVB,XPS of TiO2 and Ni2P is 2.75 and −0.39 eV (Fig. 6(a) and (b)), respectively. The EVB of the corresponding standard hydrogen electrode (EVB,NHE) is calculated using the following equation:EVB,NHE = φ + EVB,XPS − 4.44,where φ is the work function of the instrument (4.6 eV). Thus, the EVB,NHE of TiO2 and Ni2P is 2.91 and −0.23 eV, respectively. According to the formula: ECB = EVB − Eg, the ECB,NHE of TiO2 and Ni2P is −0.37. and −1.23 eV, respectively.

Furthermore, to investigate the construction of the heterojunction and charge transfer mechanism, the dominant reactive oxygen species was tested using ESR. No ESR signal was observed in all samples in the dark, suggesting that there is no electron and hole separation, as shown in Fig. S12(a) and (b) (ESI†). Under visible light irradiation, the DPPO-˙O2-signals could be observed for all samples (Fig. 6(c)). For TiO2, only a weak signal can be observed because its CB edge (−0.37 eV) electron has a weak reduction ability to O2 (O2/˙O2− = −0.33 eV).61 Ni2P showed a stronger reduction ability than TiO2 NTs, and a stronger signal was observed because of its higher CB position (−1.23 eV). In contrast, Ni2P/TiO2-15 showed the strongest signal of ˙O2−, indicating that it can retain strongly reducing electrons and react with O2. TiO2 NTs and Ni2P/TiO2 composite showed DPPO-˙OH signals (Fig. 6(d)), and Ni2P/TiO2 was significantly stronger than TiO2 NTs, indicating that Ni2P/TiO2 retained a stronger oxidation hole. However, Ni2P does not have enough oxidation ability to react with OH-owing to its high valence band (−0.23 eV), so DPPO-˙OH signals are not detected.
Based on the above experimental results and the DFT calculation, the charge transfer mechanism in the Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction was analyzed (Fig. 6(e)). If the Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction is a type II heterostructure, the charge transfer path is that the photoelectrons transfer from the Ni2P conduction band to the TiO2 conduction band under illumination, and the photogenerated holes transfer from TiO2 to Ni2P to participate in the reaction. If the above transfer path is reasonable, only weak ˙O2 signals can be observed in the Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction and no DMPO-˙OH signals can be observed due to the weak reduction and oxidation ability of the Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction. This clearly contradicts the experimental results observed with ESR. However, in the Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction, the S-scheme migration path is formed for photoelectrons. In particular, under illumination, the photoelectrons generated by TiO2 and the holes generated by Ni2P are recombined at the interface under the action of IEF and static power. Therefore, carriers with a strong reduction ability and oxidation ability accumulate in the higher conduction band (Ni2P) and lower valence band (TiO2), respectively. This fact implies that the Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction can reduce O2 and oxidize OH−, which is the same as the results obtained by ESR. Therefore, the photogenerated charge transfer path in the S-scheme described above is reasonable, which is beneficial for improving the photoelectric effect and photochemical conversion.
3.5 Application of a hollow Ni2P/TiO2 S-scheme heterojunction for photocathodic protection
To demonstrate the application potential of hollow Ni2P/TiO2 S-scheme heterojunctions in solar energy harvesting and conversion, Ni2P/TiO2 composites act as photoanodes to generate photoelectrons that provide electricity for 304ss to form cathodic protection under visible light irradiation. Monitoring the change in the open circuit potential of metal in a corrosive medium is an effective means to evaluate photocathodic protection. Fig. 7(a) shows the OCP curve of the various samples coupled with 304ss under intermittent visible light irradiation. It can be observed that when the TiO2 NTs and Ni2P/TiO2 composites were exposed to light, the surface potential of 304ss quickly dropped and maintained a steady potential, in which the potential of the 304ss coupled with the Ni2P/TiO2 composite was significantly lower than those coupled with the TiO2 NTs (Table S4, ESI†). In the absence of light, the surface potential of the 304ss increased slowly and remained below the initial potential. In addition, the decrease in the surface potential of 304ss was related to the yield of photogenerated electrons and their reducibility. The more photogenerated electrons that were available and the stronger their reducibility, the greater the drop in potential. As shown in Fig. 7(b), it can be clearly observed that the potential drop coupled with the Ni2P/TiO2 composite was significantly higher than that of the TiO2 NTs, and Ni2P/TiO2-15 showed the largest potential drop. Moreover, Fig. S13 (ESI†) shows the j–t of TiO2 NTs and the different composite photoanodes coupled with 304ss. It can be observed directly that the photocurrent density of the Ni2P/TiO2 composite was significantly greater than that of the TiO2 NTs, and the photocurrent density of Ni2P/TiO2-15 showed the maximum current density (Ni2P/TiO2-15> Ni2P/TiO2-30> Ni2P/TiO2-1 > TiO2 NTs (Table S5, ESI†)). The magnitude of the photocurrent was determined by the number of photogenerated electrons migrating from the Ni2P/TiO2 composite to the 304ss surface. Compared with previous reports (Table S6, ESI†), the performance of this system is superior to TiO2-based type-II heterojunction with the same hole scavenger. This indicates that the hollow Ni2P/TiO2 S-scheme heterojunction has better photoelectric conversion efficiency.

Fig. 8 shows the 3D topography and surface roughness data of the protected and unprotected 304ss obtained by CLSM. There was basically no difference in the laser confocal 3D topography of the blank, unprotected and protected 304ss samples after the 4 h immersion experiment. Moreover, their surface roughness did not change significantly (Fig. 8(d)). This result showed that 304ss had no obvious corrosion within 4 h. Additionally, this result showed that the photocathodic protection of the Ni2P/TiO2-15 was in the cathodic protection range of 304ss and there was no hydrogen evolution corrosion reaction. With regard to the 304ss sample after the immersion experiments for 8 h and 12 h, it can be found that the unprotected sample was obviously corroded, and convex corrosion products were observed. However, there was no obvious difference between the blank 304ss and the protected sample surface from the laser confocal 3D morphology. Moreover, the arithmetic average height (Sa) and root mean square height (Sq) of the unprotected 304ss sample were clearly higher than those of the blank and protected samples (Fig. 8(h)–(m)). This result showed that Ni2P/TiO2-15 provided good photocathodic protection for 304ss in the 8 and 12 h tests. Furthermore, the stability of heterojunction photoelectric conversion is crucial for its application. Fig. S14 (ESI†) shows the Ni2P/TiO2-15 long-term intermittent illumination experiment for 50 h (25 cycles). Consequently, Ni2P/TiO2-15 still had a good light response. Moreover, the 304ss surface potential can be maintained at a value lower than the self-corrosion potential under illumination, providing good cathodic protection. This result indicates that the Ni2P/TiO2 composite exhibits excellent stability in photoelectric conversion.

In addition, based on the charge transfer characteristics of Ni2P/TiO2 S-scheme heterojunction and its application in cathodic protection, the charge transfer mechanism of cathodic protection is explored in the collection and conversion of solar energy. This result could be attributed to the joint effects of the following factors. First, Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction inherits the unique hollow structure of TiO2 nanotubes and has excellent light capture and charge transfer performance. Second, Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction forms the S-scheme migration path for photoelectrons, which retain highly reductive photoelectrons. A schematic diagram of the photocathodic protection mechanism of the Ni2P/TiO2 S-scheme heterojunction is shown in Fig. 9. Specifically, the photogenerated electrons in the Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction are transferred to the Ni2P conduction band through the S-scheme path under illumination. Then, under the action of potential difference, photogenerated electrons transfer to the surface of 304ss, forming cathodic protection for it. Furthermore, Na2S, as an effective hole scavenger, can effectively capture photogenic holes, resulting in the following reaction:62,63S2− + 2h+ → S(x − 1)S + S2− → Sx2−(x = 2–5)S + Sx2− → Sx+12−(x = 2–4)

In general, the hollow Ni2P/TiO2 S-scheme heterojunction has great potential for application in solar energy harvesting and conversion.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a hollow Ni2P/TiO2 S-scheme heterojunction was designed to harvest solar energy and enhance the photoelectric effect. The Ni2P/TiO2 S-scheme heterojunction exhibited better light absorption and photoelectric separation abilities compared with the TiO2 NTs. Based on the experimental results of band matching and electron spin resonance (ESR), the S-scheme interfacial charge transfer path was confirmed to enhance photoelectric separation. As proof-of-concept demonstrations, the Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction was used as a photoanode to capture visible light to obtain photogenerated electrons, thereby achieving photogenerated cathodic protection. Consequently, the hollow Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction, as a photoanode, provides good cathodic protection for 304ss, and the surface potential of the 304ss coupled with the Ni2P/TiO2 heterojunction decreases to −0.83 V in a 3.5% NaCl solution under visible light irradiation. In general, the hollow Ni2P/TiO2 S-scheme heterojunction has great potential for application in solar energy harvesting and conversion.
