        We, for the first time, prepared a flexible photoelectrode for CdS/CdSe quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). A power conversion efficiency of 3.47% was achieved under AM 1.5G illumination for a sandwich type QDSSC consisting of this flexible photoelectrode, Cu2S counter electrode and polysulfide electrolyte between the electrodes.

Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have recently attracted much attention since semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), such as CdS, CdSe, PbS,1 are considered to be next-generation alternative sensitizers of costly dyes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The QDs have many advantages, including solar spectrum matching capability from tunable size-dependent gaps, multiple electron–hole generation ability from impact ionization effect, low cost, and easy synthesis. In other ways, development of flexible solar cells is also an unavoidable trend in the future.2 To the best of our knowledge, however, there is no report on the flexible photoelectrode of QDSSCs. Many reported techniques3 in preparation of DSC photoelectrodes have demonstrated that a high temperature (450 °C–500 °C) sintering process is crucial to achieve better electrical contact between the semiconductor films and the conducting layer on the substrate, as well as between TiO2 particles. However, flexible transparent conductive oxides (TCO) substrates, such as indium tin oxides–polyethylene terephthalate (ITO–PET), cannot withstand high temperature. Herein, to utilize the advantages of the sintering process and of flexible transparent substrates, we have found a new route through the technique of first depositing the TiO2 layer and fluorine-doped tin oxides (FTO) layer at high temperature and then preparing the PET substrate at lower temperature to avoid the temperature conflict, and firstly report on the preparation of highly efficient flexible CdS/CdSe QDSSCs photoelectrodes.
Glazed graphite substrates (40 mm × 45 mm × 2 mm) were firstly pretreated using abrasive paper (PANDA, #300) and adhesive tape (3M, Scotch 810) to be rough in the middle area (20 mm × 45 mm) (see Fig. 1a, step 1). TiO2 paste with 300 nm TiO2 rutile particles was then deposited on the rough surface of the graphite substrates by screen printing and followed by sintering at 450 °C for 30 min as the scattering layer, the thickness of which was kept the same (2 μm). TiO2 paste with 20 nm TiO2 anatase nanoparticles was subsequently deposited on the scattering layer by screen printing and also sintered at 450 °C for 30 min as the nanocrystal layer, the thickness of which varied from 4 μm to 16 μm (see Fig. 1a, step 2). The preparation of the 20 nm-sized nanoparticle TiO2 and TiO2 paste was carried out according to the literature.4 After despositng the TiO2 scattering layer and nanocrystal layer, the FTO layer was then directly deposited on the nanocrystal layer surface and the graphite surface of both sides by the spray pyrolysis technique (see Fig. 1a, step 3) with the homemade deposition setup that was published elsewhere.5 The temperature of the nanocrystal layer surface and the graphite surface was kept at 450 °C, and an intermittent spraying process with 1 min spraying and 1 min suspension was applied to help maintain the high temperature since the nanocrystal layer was actually a kind of thermal isolation structure.6 The spraying time was kept to 1 h. After the FTO layer was successfully deposited, the temperature was firstly cooled to 250 °C, at which point the PET substrate could be directly melted onto the entire FTO layer surface (see Fig. 1a, step 4) and then rapidly cooled to room temperature. The thickness of the PET substrate was about 70 μm. Therefore, the structure of graphite substrate/TiO2 scattering layer/TiO2 nanocrystal layer/FTO layer/PET substrate was obtained. At last, the structure of the PET/FTO/Nanocrystal Layer/Scattering Layer could be easily peeled off from the graphite substrate because the TiO2 scattering layer was of a relatively incompact structure (see Fig. 1a, step 5). A small number of the TiO2 scattering layer particles were left on the rough graphite surface in the middle area after peeling, and in the meanwhile a thin surface glazed graphite layer of both sides could also be peeled off together with the FTO layer (see Fig. 1b). Accordingly, the flexible TiO2 photoanode based on PET was successfully achieved. For comparison, the conventional method7 was used to deposit the same nanocrystal layer and scattering layer on commercial FTO glass (Pilkington, TEC-15, 13 Ω/□) sequentially with the same screen printing and sintering process. Finally, the conventional FTO glass based TiO2 photoanode as the structure of Glass/FTO/Nanocrystal Layer/Scattering Layer was sensitized by CdS and CdSe quantum dots sequentially together with the flexible photoanode. The thickness of the nanocrystal layer and scattering layer was kept the same as the flexible photoanode. Fig. 1c and d shows the flexible photoanode before and after the CdS/CdSe QDs deposition, respectively.

The deposition of CdS and CdSe quantum dots on the photoanodes was achieved by the chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique according to the literature.8 All the QDs (CdS and CdSe) deposition were carried out at 10 °C. The deposition time for CdS and CdSe QDs was 50 min and 5.5 h, respectively. Finally, to achieve better performance, the photoanodes were passivated with ZnS by twice being dipped into 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2 and Na2S aqueous solution for 1 min alternately.
To investigate the properties of the flexible photoanodes, Cu2S on brass9 as counter electrodes and polysulfide electrolyte (1 M Na2S and 1 M S) were used to assemble the sandwich-type QDSSCs. A silicone spacer (thickness: 25 μm) was used to separate the photoanode and the counter electrode. A mask with a window area of 0.15 cm2 was clipped on the TiO2 side to define the active area of the cell when testing. The morphologies of the flexible photoanode were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI, S-FEG, XL30). The optical transmissions were characterized by UV-VIS spectroscopy (SHIMADZU, UV2550). The electrical properties were measured by four-point probes resistivity measurement system (Four Probes Tech, RTS-9). The J–V characteristics of QDSSCs were recorded by a potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research, Model 263 A) under AM 1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel Solar Simulator, 91192). The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured by using a lab-made IPCE setup illuminated under 8 mW cm−2 monochromic light.10 The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out on ZAHNER IM6e electrochemical workstations over a frequency range of 0.1–105 Hz.

Fig. 2 displays the SEM micrographs of the cross section of the flexible photoanode with the nanocrystal layer of 8 μm after CdS/CdSe QDs deposition. The FTO layer we prepared is about 1.5 μm, which is thicker than the 450 nm FTO layer of the commercial FTO glass. To investigate the optical transmission of our FTO layer with the commercial FTO layer, we deposited the same quality FTO as prepared in the flexible photoanode directly on glass, and compared its transmittance with the commercial FTO glass shown in Fig. 3a. The result clearly shows that the transmittance of commercial FTO is higher than our FTO layer. Fig. 3a also shows the IPCE spectrum of our PET based flexible photoanode and the FTO glass based photoanode, the nanocrystal layers of which were both kept at 8 μm. The result shows that the IPCE values of the glass-based photoanode were higher than the PET based flexible photoanode throughout the responsive wavelength, which thereby could be well-explained by the different optical transmittance of these two different FTO layers. On the other hand, four-point probes resistivity measurement shows that the sheet resistance of our FTO layer is 14–15 Ω/□, which is almost the same as the value of commercial FTO glass. To further investigate the electrical contact between the FTO layer and TiO2 nanocrystals, Fig. 3b displays the Nyquist plots of the QDSSCs based on these two different photoanodes. The magnified figure in Fig. 3b illuminates the highly approximate values of series ohmic resistance, which mainly reflect the resistance of the FTO layer and the contact resistance between FTO and TiO2 nanocrystal at high frequency (lowest Z′).11 Therefore, the electric contact between the FTO layer and TiO2 nanocrystals of the PET based photoanode was as good as of the glass based photoanode since the two FTO layers were of almost the same sheet resistance.

Fig. 4 shows the J–V curve of QDSSCs based on four different flexible photoanodes with different nanocrystal layer thicknesses of 4 μm, 8 μm, 12 μm and 16 μm, which were defined as sample A, B, C and D, respectively. The result shows that with the increasing thickness of the nanocrystal layer, the short circuit current density (Jsc) firstly increased to the highest value when the nanocrystal layer thickness was 12 μm and then decreased slightly; the open circuit voltage (Voc) steadily decreased. This trend was similar to that in typical DSCs.7 The specific photovoltaic performances of the four flexible samples are shown in Table 1. The highest power conversion efficiency could be reached up to 3.47% when the nanocrystal layer thickness was 12 μm. For comparison, conventional QDSSCs of glass-based photoanodes with nanocrystal layer thicknesses of 4 μm, 8 μm, 12 μm and 16 μm were also tested as sample Glass-A, Glass-B, Glass-C and Glass-D, respectively, as shown in Table 1. The highest efficiency of 3.96% was achieved for Glass-C, the nanocrystal layer thickness of which was also 12 μm. Therefore, the flexible photoanode prepared through our novel method could achieve more than 87% efficiency of the conventional glass-based photoanode. The reason for the lower efficiency of the flexible photoanode was mainly the lower Jsc shown in Table 1. Considering Jsc was basically determined by IPCE,10 lower Jsc was thereby caused by lower transmittance of the FTO layer we prepared according to the above-concluded relations between IPCE and FTO transmittance.

In summary, we have developed a novel method to successfully avoid temperature conflict between the sintering process and flexible transparent substrates, and for the first time have prepared a high quality flexible photoanode for CdS/CdSe QDSSCs. The highest efficiency of 3.47% was obtained under AM 1.5 illumination for the QDSSC based on this kind of flexible photoanode, which reached more than 87% efficiency of the conventional glass based photoanode. These reproducible results and the new preparation technique we propose in this work are able to inspire more efficient work in preparing flexible QDSSCs or DSCs.
