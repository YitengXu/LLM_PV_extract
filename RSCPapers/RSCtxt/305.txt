    , Accepted 16th June 2015First published on 19th June 2015AbstractTo make quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) competitive, photovoltaic parameters comparable to those of other emerging solar cell technologies are necessary. In the present study, ZnSe was used as an alternative to ZnS, one of the most widely used passivation materials in QDSSCs. ZnSe was deposited on a TiO2–CdS–CdSe photoanode to form a core–shell structure, which was more efficient in terms of reducing the electron recombination in QDSSCs. The development of an efficient passivation layer is a requirement for preventing recombination processes in order to attain high-performance and stable QDSSCs. A layer of inorganic Mn–ZnSe was applied to a QD-sensitized photoanode to enhance the adsorption and strongly inhibit interfacial recombination processes in QDSSCs, which greatly improved the power conversion efficiency. Impedance spectroscopy revealed that the combined Mn doping with ZnSe treatment reduces interfacial recombination and increases charge collection efficiency compared with Mn–ZnS, ZnS, and ZnSe. A solar cell based on the CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe photoanode yielded excellent performance with a solar power conversion efficiency of 5.67%, Voc of 0.584 V, and Jsc of 17.59 mA cm−2. Enhanced electron transport and reduced electron recombination are responsible for the improved Jsc and Voc of the QDSSCs. The effective electron lifetime of the device with Mn–ZnSe was higher than those with Mn–ZnS, ZnSe, and ZnS, leading to more efficient electron–hole separation and slower electron recombination.
1. Introduction
Solar power is a source of low-cost, clean, and environmentally friendly energy. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received much attention because of their simple fabrication procedure and high efficiency. A DSSC device consists of a dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, a tri-iodide/iodide (I3−/I−) electrolyte, and a counter electrode (CE).1,2 Inorganic quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have been extensively explored to replace the expensive dyes in DSSCs due to their band gap tunability, low production costs, simple fabrication, high absorption coefficient, solution processability, multiple exciton generation (MEG) potential, and hot electron transfer. These aspects have made them prime candidates for next-generation solar cell designs.1–8 Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) materials such as CdS, CdSe, PbS, PbSe, CdTe, and InP have been extensively studied as light harvesters due to their unique advantages.9–13
As QD-sensitizers, CdS and CdSe are promising materials for liquid junction solar cells, which have been rejuvenated because of the emergence of QDs. CdS has a higher conduction band edge than TiO2, which is advantageous for the injection of excited electrons from CdS.14 Also, the band gap of CdS (2.25 eV) limits the absorption range of wavelength. Although the absorption range of CdSe can extend to higher wavelength, the electron injection efficiency seems to be lower than that of CdS due to its lower conduction band edge than that of TiO2.2,14
Due to the advantages of light harvesting and electron injection, CdS and CdSe have been used as sensitizers for TiO2 thin films. The sensitization is achieved by SILAR (successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction), chemical bath deposition, electrophoresis, linker assisted binding and direct adsorption.14–20 SILAR has gained popularity due to its simplicity and, more importantly, the intimate contact between donors and acceptors that results.
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of QDSSCs is still lower than that of DSSCs.21–24 The poorer performance of QDSSCs is mainly due to the narrow adsorption range of QDs, weak electron collection by the TiO2 from the QDs,25 charge recombination at the QD–electrolyte interface,26 recombination at the interface between the CE and the electrolyte,27 and the difficulty of assembling a sufficiently large number of QDs on a mesoporous TiO2 matrix to obtain a well-covered monolayer without cluster formation or aggregation.28 Other possible reasons include the selection of an efficient electrolyte in which metal chalcogenide can run stably without serious degradation.
The PCE of QDSSCs could be improved in the following ways: (i) optimization of the QD-sensitized electrode structure,29 (ii) efficiently controlling the crystal size and size distribution of the QDs,30 (iii) using a polysulfide electrolyte,30 (iv) modifying the intrinsic properties of semiconductor nanocrystals by introducing dopants,31 (v) passivation layer deposition, and (vi) finding a suitable CE material32 that favors electron transfer, collection, and reduced recombination. The optical and structural properties are significantly affected by the high surface-to-volume ratio of QDs. Because defects on the surface of QDs serve as temporary surface traps for electrons, they hinder charge transfer into the TiO2 conduction bands and therefore greatly decrease the power conversion efficiency in QDSSCs.33 It is possible to suppress the recombination of injected electrons at the photoanode/electrolyte interface by passivating a wide-band-gap shell on bare QDs and enhancing the efficiency in QDSSCs.34
Among the wide-band-gap semiconductors, zinc sulfide (ZnS) is a preferred material for surface coatings.35 ZnS has a more negative minimum conduction band edge (Ecb) and a more positive maximum valence band edge (Evb) compared to CdSe and CdS, leading to a type I energy alignment of the core/shell structure. In this structure, the ZnS shell prevents the recombination of holes and electrons at the QD/electrolyte interface.36 As a consequence, although the electron back-reaction from QDs to the electrolyte is reduced, the hindrance of the desired hole transport from QDs to the electrolyte reduces charge separation in QDs.37 Hence, controlling the ZnS thickness is beneficial from the reduced recombination and overcomes the loss in charge separation, which is critical for improving the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs.
Theoretically, the negative impact of the passivation layer on electron and hole separation in a QDSSC can be overcome using a type II core/shell energy alignment. Ecb and Evb of the shell are higher than those of the CdS and CdSe cores in a type II core/shell structure. ZnSe is one suitable passivation material to form a type II core/shell structure for CdSe/CdS QDs. ZnSe treatment can effectively cover the bare TiO2 and QDs, resulting in strong inhibition of the electron leakage from either TiO2 or QDs to the electrolyte, thereby significantly improving the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs.38,39
ZnS and ZnSe have limited application potential in QDSSCs because of their wide band gap, which does not allow absorption of sunlight in the visible and infrared regions. Today's best QDSSCs with passivation layer have only achieved power conversion efficiencies of 4–5%. The work of Ahmed et al. reported that the ZnSe that was deposited on a CdS/CdSe/TiO2 photoanode to form a semi-core/shell structure has been found to be more efficient in terms of reducing electron recombination in QDSSCs. Then the power conversion efficiency was improved from 1.86% for ZnSe0 (without coating) to 3.99% using 2 layers of ZnSe coating (ZnSe2) deposited by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method.40 For instance, Liu et al. found that the maximum energy conversion efficiency of 3.46% was achieved for CdSe QDSSC with ZnSe/ZnS treatment, showing a 22% increment compared to that with ZnS treatment.39 However, the passivation layer alone in QDSSC is not sufficient to greatly improve the photovoltaic performance. Recently, Aboulaich et al. reported that under optimal conditions, thioglycerol-capped ZnSe:Mn QDs with an average diameter of 3.5 nm and a PL quantum yield of 3.5% in water at neutral pH were produced.41 Therefore, the dopant can alter the charge separation and recombination dynamics in QDSSCs by creating electronic states in the mid-gap region of the QDs.31 It is also possible to tune the optical and electronic properties of semiconductor nanocrystals by controlling the type and concentration of dopants, which improves the PCE. Introducing intermediate energy levels into the ZnS or ZnSe is one way of expanding the absorption window into the visible region.42 Therefore, the combination of both dopants and passivation layers in QDSSCs can greatly improve the photovoltaic performance. To date, the application of Mn–ZnS and Mn–ZnSe in the CdS–CdSe QD system has not been reported.
Research has not been reported on QDSSCs based on CdS–CdSe QDs using Mn–ZnS and Mn–ZnSe as a shell layer. In this work, we demonstrate the effect of Mn–ZnS and Mn–ZnSe coating layers on the performance, charge transport, and recombination of CdS–CdSe-sensitized solar cells. Under standard simulated AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2), a solar cell based on the CdS–CdSe–ZnS QD-sensitized TiO2 electrode presents a Voc of 0.565 V and a PCE of 3.82%. Most importantly, by exchanging the ZnS with ZnSe, the cell performance of the CdS–CdSe–ZnSe QDSSC was further improved to a Voc of 0.583 V and an energy conversion efficiency of 4.22%. Photovoltaic investigations showed that the cell performance of the QDSSC was obviously improved by the introduction of Mn–ZnS and Mn–ZnSe, which leads to a highly efficient solar cell with energy conversion efficiencies of 5.17% and 5.67%. A study of the electron transport and recombination confirms that the ZnSe or Mn–ZnSe coating layers significantly suppress the electron recombination compared to ZnS or Mn–ZnS in solar cells.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Cadmium acetate dehydrate [Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O], manganese(II) acetate tetrahydrate [Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O], zinc acetate dehydrate [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O], sodium sulfide (Na2S), sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), potassium chloride (KCl), copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate [CuSO4·5H2O], sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3), and urea (CH4N2O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide HT/SP) was supplied by Solaronix. All other chemicals were commercially available and were of analytical grade.
2.2 Fabrication of TiO2 photoanodes
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, 13 Ω sq−2, Hartford Glass Co. Inc.) was used as the substrates for the photoanode and CE. The TiO2 photoanodes were fabricated on ultrasonically well-cleaned FTO substrate via the doctor blade method. 20 nm anatase TiO2 particles (Ti-Nanoxide HT/SP, Solaronix) were first deposited on FTO substrates with an active area of 0.27 cm2. The TiO2 substrate was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min to remove the impurities. A thickness of 7.5 μm was obtained after solvent evaporation. The as-prepared TiO2 electrodes were used for further sensitization by CdS and CdSe QDs.
2.3 Fabrication of CdS–CdSe-sensitized photoanodes
CdS and CdSe QDs were prepared based on a literature method.43 In brief, a TiO2 film was dipped into an aqueous mixed solution containing 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O for 5 min to allow Cd2+ to adsorb onto the TiO2. It was then rinsed with DI water and dipped for another 5 min into an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Na2S, where the pre-adsorbed Cd2+ reacts with S2− to form the desired CdS. The film was rinsed again with DI water and dried with a drier. This procedure was repeated for five cycles, and the as-prepared electrode was named as TiO2–CdS.
For CdSe QDs, sodium selenosulfate (Na2SeSO3) was used as a Se source for SILAR. An Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution was prepared by refluxing Se (0.2 M) in an aqueous solution of Na2SO3 (0.4 M) at 120 °C for 4 h. The as-prepared CdS electrodes were then dipped into an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O for 5 min at room temperature and rinsed with DI water. Then, samples were dipped into an aqueous solution of Na2SeSO3 for 5 min at 50 °C and rinsed again with DI water. This procedure was repeated for eight cycles, and the as-synthesized electrode was named as TiO2–CdS–CdSe.
2.4 Deposition of ZnS and Mn–ZnS passivation layers
The as-synthesized CdSe–CdSe electrodes were coated with a ZnS passivation layer using 1, 2, and 3 SILAR cycles, which decreases the rate of recombination and assists in electron transport. The electrodes were alternately dipped into an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O for 5 min and a solution of 0.1 M Na2S for 5 min. They were then rinsed with DI water and dried with a drier. The preparation of the CE is described elsewhere.38 For Mn2+ doping, appropriate molar percentages of 5%, 10%, and 15% Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O (5 mM, 10 mM, and 15 mM) were mixed with the Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O. This enabled the co-adsorption of Mn2+ and Zn2+ ions, which in turn promoted the incorporation of Mn2+ in the ZnS film. The as-synthesized electrodes were named as CdS–CdSe–ZnS and CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS.
2.5 Deposition of ZnSe and Mn–ZnSe passivation layers
The CdS–CdSe electrodes were coated with a ZnSe passivation layer using 2 SILAR cycles. The electrodes were alternately dipped into an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O for 5 min at 50 °C and a solution of Na2SeSO3 for 5 min at 50 °C for 5 min. They were then rinsed with DI water and dried with a drier. For Mn2+ doping, 10% (10 mM) Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O was mixed with the Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O. This enabled the co-adsorption of Mn2+ and Zn2+ ions, which promoted the incorporation of Mn2+ in the ZnSe film. The as-synthesized electrodes were named as CdS–CdSe–ZnSe and CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe. Finally, the prepared photoanode and CEs were sealed using a sealant (SX 1170-60, Solaronix) at 100 °C. The space between the electrodes was filled with a polysulfide electrolyte consisting of sodium sulfide (1 M), sulfur (2 M), and sodium hydroxide (0.2 M) in a solution with a methanol-to-water ratio of 7:3.
2.6 Characterization
The surface morphology and elemental compositions of the electrodes were investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-2400, Hitachi) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDX) operated at 15 kV.‡ The crystalline nature of the electrodes was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/Max-2400, Rigaku) using a Cu Kα source operated at 40 kV and 30 mA in the 2θ range of 20–80°. X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 with monochromatic Al-Kα radiation of 1486.6 eV and with an electron take-off angle of 90°. The current–voltage characteristics of the QDSSCs were examined under one sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) using an ABET Technologies (USA) solar simulator with an irradiance uniformity of ±3%. The surface roughness of the substrates prepared using SILAR was characterized using an atomic force microscope (JPK NanoWizard II AFM, JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany) with a scan rate of 0.8 Hz in contact mode.
The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded using an OPTIZEN 3220UV spectrophotometer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted on the QDSSCs using a BioLogic potentiostat/galvanostat/EIS analyzer (SP-150, France) under one sun illumination. The frequency ranged from 100 mHz to 500 kHz at room temperature. The applied bias voltage and AC amplitude were set to Voc of the QDSSCs and 10 mV, respectively. The electrical impedance was characterized using Nyquist and Bode plots. To test the stability, the CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe QDSSC was continuously irradiated with AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 under working conditions, and the J–V curves were tested every 1 h.
3. Results and discussion
The SEM images in Fig. 1 show the result of different passivation layers of ZnS, ZnSe, Mn–ZnS and Mn–ZnSe on the surface of TiO2–CdS–CdSe. The CdS–CdSe–ZnS film in Fig. 1a is composed of nanoparticles with average diameters in the range of ∼14–26 nm. Fig. 1b shows the deposition of ZnSe on the surface of CdS–CdSe. The sizes of the constituent particles increased, with average diameter in the range of ∼15–28 nm. The top view of CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS and CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe samples (Fig. 1c and d) shows the filling of pores in the TiO2–CdS–CdSe film with the introduction of Mn into ZnS and ZnSe. The CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS sample shows that some of the pores are partially filled with Mn–ZnS, but clear evidence of filling is seen at Mn–ZnSe. The pore filling with nanoparticles in CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS and CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe can facilitate the penetration of the electrolyte. Top view of the resulting samples (Fig. 1) demonstrates that the surface coverage of the passivation layer on CdS–CdSe increases with Mn-doping in the passivation layer, i.e. it changes from nanoparticles on top of the mesoporous CdS–CdSe film to a complete densely packed layer of Mn–ZnS and Mn–ZnSe. However the improved surface morphology could extend the absorption in the visible and near IR regions of solar light. The elements in the photoanode were confirmed by EDX analysis, and the results are shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† Fig. S1† shows that the energy levels of the Mn element observed at 0.650 keV, 5.89 keV, and 6.536 keV correspond to LIαβ, Kα, and Kαβ, respectively.

The surface topography of the as-deposited CdS–CdSe–ZnS, CdS–CdSe–ZnSe, CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS and CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe films was investigated by scanning probe atomic force microscopy (AFM), and 3D AFM images are shown in Fig. 2. The typical root-mean square roughness (Rq) of FTO-TiO2 was found to be 35.21 nm and the result is shown in Fig. S2.† The Rq were observed to be 14.92, 12.41, 9.4, 8.5 nm on deposition of CdS–CdSe–ZnS, CdS–CdSe–ZnSe, CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS and CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe electrodes, respectively. The decrease in surface roughness with the doping of Mn in ZnS and ZnSe is associated with a filling of pores in the TiO2–CdS–CdSe surface. It is evident that the doping of the thin film modifies the surface morphology and the surface roughness. Fig. 2d shows that a thick layer of Mn–ZnSe is formed on the surface of TiO2–CdS–CdSe. The result of AFM studies is consistent with the SEM analysis. An even and regular morphology is required for acceptable performance in photovoltaic devices. The photovoltaic performance of a solar cell mainly depends on the small roughness of the film, and reduction of the surface roughness tends to improve the conversion efficiency of QDSSCs.44 The crystallinity of the CdS–CdSe on the TiO2 substrate was determined by XRD and the results are shown in Fig. S3.†

XPS was measured to know the composition and chemical bond configuration of Mn-doped ZnS and Mn-doped ZnSe thin films on the surface of TiO2–CdS–CdSe. Fig. 3 displays the XPS spectra of the nanostructured TiO2–CdS–CdSe films loaded with Mn–ZnS and Mn–ZnSe QDs. In Fig. 3, the characteristic peaks of Ti, O, Cd, Zn, S, Se, and Mn are all shown. The Cd 3d peak appears at a binding energy of 405.13 eV. When Cd reacts with S and Se, the formation of CdS and CdSe QDs is verified by the signals of S (2p) and Se (3d) peaks at binding energies of 161.06 eV and 53.92 eV, respectively. The binding energy peaks of Zn 2p3/2 are observed at 1022.37 and 1022.33 eV for CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS and CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe, respectively. The binding energy of the Zn 2p1/2 peak for CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS and CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe films is observed at 1045.45 and 1045.51 eV, respectively. Fig. 3 shows that the peak of Zn in Mn–ZnSe has higher intensity than the Zn peak in Mn–ZnS. This shows a good symmetry, indicating the presence of Zn in the 2p chemical states in Mn–ZnS and Mn–ZnSe thin films. Also, the peak deconvolution process clearly shows that the Mn 2p spectrum of the film is composed of two peaks, at 641.64 eV and 653.1 eV, indicating the state of Mn2+ in Mn–ZnS and Mn–ZnSe QDs. The individual XPS spectra of Zn, S, Se, and Mn elements are shown in Fig. S4.† Therefore, the XPS results suggest that the Mn–ZnS and Mn–ZnSe are successfully deposited on the surface of CdS–CdSe QDs.

Fig. 4 illustrates the overall operating mechanism of the proposed solar cells based on the TiO2–CdS–CdSe–ZnSe photoanode. Upon illumination, the CdS and CdSe mainly absorb visible light, generating photoexcited electron–hole pairs. After that, the electrons that were photoexcited on the CdSe–CdS sensitizers were effectively transported to the conduction band of TiO2 through the cascade type-II band structure, and holes moved in the opposite direction through the valence bands, finally oxidizing the polysulfide mediator. ZnSe has been proven to be a good passivation layer for reducing electron recombination at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface.40 Overall, the ZnSe passivation layer on the surface of CdS–CdSe can improve the photovoltaic performance of the QDSSCs.

The absorption spectra of TiO2 films with ZnS, ZnSe, Mn–ZnS, Mn–ZnSe passivation layer treatment are shown in Fig. S5.†Fig. 5(A) shows the light absorption spectrum of the TiO2–CdS–CdSe photoanode with different passivation coating layers. 2 SILAR cycles were used to deposit the passivation layer on the surface of QDs. The sensitization of ZnSe on the surface of CdS–CdSe can slightly enhance the absorption intensity compared to that of ZnS in the whole visible region. The optical absorption ranges of the CdS–CdSe–ZnS and CdS–CdS–ZnSe samples are extending to ∼619 and 628 nm, respectively. After dopants are introduced into ZnS and ZnSe, the absorption edge of the CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS and CdS–CdS–Mn–ZnSe samples shifts to ∼662 and 691 nm, respectively. In addition, the deposition of Mn–ZnSe also extends the absorption edge towards a longer wavelength and shows a small proportion of absorption in the near infrared region simultaneously, which is due to the Mn–ZnSe formed inside the mesoporous TiO2–CdS–CdSe, where it has to form small crystals, which may show some quantum confinement effects. The improved absorbance range of Mn–ZnS and Mn–ZnSe is due to the improvement of surface morphology and introduction of intermediate-energy levels into the ZnS or ZnSe with Mn-dopant.42 The absorbance intensity of these films increases and noticeable shifts of the absorbance edge towards longer wavelengths occur with Mn-doping into ZnSe QDs. The visible light absorption indicated that Mn is doped successfully into ZnS and ZnSe, and the improvement of the visible light absorbance may enhance the performance of the QDSSCs. The higher photovoltaic performance can be attributed to the higher intensity and red shift of light absorption in the range of 400–700 nm and increases of the electron concentration in the TiO2 substrate sensitized by CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe. Especially, the optical absorption is heightened and desirable for solar light harvesting. These results indicate that the light absorption range can be improved by the doping of Mn into ZnS or ZnSe, providing its application value to enhance the performance of QDSSCs.

Fig. 5(B) shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the TiO2 films loaded with CdS–CdSe–ZnS, CdS–CdSe–ZnSe, CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS and CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe QDs, respectively. The spectra reveal that the PL of the film loaded with CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe QDs is higher than that of the film loaded with other QDs. The possible reason is that the Mn2+ doped into ZnSe QDs can cover an emission window similar to that of the current workhorse of intrinsic QD emitters, leading to the increase of the PL of QDs.45 The dopant creates electronic states in the mid-gap region of the QDs and thus alters the charge separation and recombination.46 In addition, the increase in PL enhances the emission quantum yield (QY) of QDs, which leads to the production of more excitations. In a typical PL experiment, a light source was used to excite the QD that provides photons with energy higher than the band-gap energy. After the photons are absorbed, holes and electrons are formed with finite momenta in the valence and conduction bands, respectively. The photon emission is derived from the recombination of the electrons and holes. The high PL emission value is favorable because more excitons (electrons and holes) results in more recombination of electrons and holes to emit a large number of photons. However, in the QDSSCs, the electrons are mainly transferred to electrodes instead of recombination with holes. So a high PL intensity would improve the high charge density in the QDSSCs.47 So the dopant Mn2+ can accelerate the electron injection from QDs to TiO2. This result is consistent with the improvement of absorbance in CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe QDs facilitating the transfer of electrons from QDs to TiO2.
In QDSSCs, the facile SILAR method is one of the most popular methods to fabricate QD-sensitized electrodes. In our previous studies we reported that for the co-sensitization system, an electrode prepared by using 5 cycles of CdS plus 8 cycles of CdSe (TiO2/CdS5/CdSe8) exhibits the best performance.48 The optimization of the SILAR cycles of ZnS on the surface of CdS–CdSe is shown in Fig. S6 of the ESI.† In the J–V curves corresponding to Fig. S6,† the photovoltaic performance was reduced with an excess amount of ZnS (3 SILAR cycles). The reason is the excessive passivation layer deposition overcrowding QDs, which may affect the performance of the solar cells. For the passivation layer deposition system, an electrode prepared using 2 SILAR cycles of passivation on the surface of CdS–CdSe exhibited the best performance. Fig. 6 shows the J–V curves of the CdS–CdSe–ZnS, CdS–CdSe–ZnSe, CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS, and CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe cells with a photoactive area of 0.27 cm2 under the irradiation of 1 full sun intensity (AM 1.5 G at 100 mW cm−2). The average values for key photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1.

The photovoltaic parameters of the QDSSC fabricated using combined CdS–CdSe–ZnS QDs include a Voc of 0.565 V, Jsc of 11.75 mA cm−2, FF of 0.575, and η of 3.82%. The QDSSCs using CdS–CdSe–ZnSe QDs as a sensitizer show the best performance, with Jsc = 12.64 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.583 V, FF = 0.571, and η = 4.22%. The sensitization of CdS–CdSe with ZnSe results in a systematic improvement of Jsc and Voc, which is attributed to the slightly extended light absorption range and increased absorptivity with red-shift of the absorption onset of QD sensitizers. We expect that the optical and structural properties would be significantly affected by Mn doping in the passivation layer. Still, it is necessary to suppress the recombination of injected electrons at the photoanode/electrolyte interface by doping the passivation layer with Mn and enhancing the efficiency in QDSSCs. We found that the introduction of Mn into ZnS and ZnSe improved the photovoltaic performance of the QDSSC. The J–V curves of optimized Mn doping in the ZnS layer are shown in Fig. S7.† The electrode prepared with 10% Mn in the ZnS shows superior photovoltaic performance in the QDSSC (Table S2, ESI†).
The Jsc of CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS QDs is 17.34 mA cm−2, and the power conversion efficiency is 5.17%, which is higher than that of the CdS–CdSe–ZnS electrode (3.82%). Similarly, in CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe QDSSCs, the Jsc was improved to 17.59 mA cm−2, and the efficiency was 5.67%, which is higher than that of the QDSSC without Mn doping (CdS–CdSe–ZnSe: 4.22%). The higher Jsc for CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe cells should be ascribed to the broader light-harvesting range and higher electron injection rate. The result shows that the Mn–ZnSe passivation layer for CdS–CdSe acts as an efficient intermediate layer between the electrolyte and the photoanode surface, significantly improving the electron lifetime and leading to improved photovoltaic performance.

Fig. 7a shows the impedance spectra of QDSSCs associated with different photoanodes measured under a simulated light source of 100 mW cm−2. The corresponding Nyquist plots for the frequency range of 100 mHz–500 kHz are shown in Fig. 7a. The equivalent circuit in the inset of Fig. 7c is used to fit the Nyquist plots using Z-view software. The EIS investigation of the QDSSCs provides valuable information for understanding the photovoltaic parameters of the J–V curves. Generally, all of the EIS spectra of QDSSCs containing a liquid electrolyte exhibit three semicircles in the Nyquist plot. The starting point of the first semicircle is the series resistance Rs, which is the transport resistance of FTO and all resistances outside of the cell. The first semicircle in the Nyquist plot contains the recombination resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface (RCE), which is parallel to the CE capacitance (CCE). The second semicircle (middle frequency circle) is the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface, which is parallel to the corresponding chemical capacitance (Cμ). The low frequency semicircle (third semicircle) is the Warburg diffusion (Zw) in the electrolyte.
 Fig. 7  Electrical impedance spectra of QDSSCs with different electrodes in the form of (a) Nyquist-plots, (b) Bode phase-diagrams, and (c) the equivalent circuit used to fit the experimental data. 
Similar Rs values were obtained for all Nyquist plots in Fig. 7a because of the identical CE (FTO/CuS). The change in RCE could be attributed to the property alteration of the redox polysulfide using similar CuS electrodes. The RCE values of CdS–CdSe–ZnS, CdS–CdSe–ZnSe, CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS, and CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe were found to be 3.30, 2.16, 2.62, and 1.87 Ω, respectively. The results suggest that the electron injection at the counter-electrode/electrolyte-solution interface was more efficient in the presence of the Mn-passivation layer (Mn–ZnSe), which prevented undesirable leakage from the QDs to the polysulfide electrolyte. The Rct value of CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe (4.79 Ω) is lower than that of CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS (5.26 Ω). The low Rct value suggests that the CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe configuration provides better electron transport in the photoanode by suppressing the recombination when the Mn–ZnSe layer passivates on the surface of CdS–CdSe.39 The Zw value (1.37 Ω) of the CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe indicates better electrolyte diffusion, facilitates faster mass transport of the electrons, and improves the performance of the QDSSC.
The chemical capacitance (Cμ) mainly indicates the injection and accumulation of electrons into the photoanodes. The capacity to accumulate electrons was dependent on the conduction band position, as in eqn (1):49,50 (1)
According to the EIS model, the electron lifetime before the recombination (τr) can be estimated [τr = 1/(2πfmax)] using the Bode plot (Fig. 7b). The τr values obtained for CdS–CdSe–ZnS, CdS–CdSe–ZnSe, CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS, and CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe were 124, 141, 201, and 263 ms, respectively. The increased electron lifetime in CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe supports the reduction of back-reaction for the injected electrons with a polysulfide electrolyte. The ZnSe layer effectively passivated the surface of the CdS–CdSe QDs and hence reduced the recombination.

Fig. 8 shows the photovoltage decay plots and the electron lifetimes as a function of photovoltage. It was observed that the photovoltage of the photoelectrodes CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS and CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe decays more slowly than that of the photoelectrodes CdS–CdSe–ZnS and CdS–CdSe–ZnSe. The decreased electron lifetime of the CdS–CdSe–ZnS and CdS–CdSe–ZnSe electrodes indicates a higher charge recombination rate and a lower charge collection efficiency than those of the CdSe–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe and CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS electrodes.51 These results demonstrate that the improvement of CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe in QDSSCs is attributed to both the enhanced light absorption and the reduced charge recombination.

Fig. 9a and b show the impedance spectra for the CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS and CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe under different applied biases in the dark. The Nyquist plot indicates that the diameter of the lower frequency semicircle decreases with increased bias voltage from 0 to 0.7 V. The decrease in diameter under bias conditions is due to the electrons injected into the conduction band of TiO2 that recombine with the polysulfide electrolyte. The rate of this recombination (back reaction) is faster with an increase of the bias voltage toward the Voc. Under short circuit conditions, more injected electrons reach the external circuit by the back contact, so the number of electrons returning to the redox couple is reduced significantly.52 Therefore, under bias conditions, the decrease of the lower frequency semicircle can be explained by the change of the number of electrons recombining with the electrolyte at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The arc of the semicircle is closely related to the short circuit current, and expansion of the semicircle at lower frequency corresponds to a decrease in the short circuit current. The QDSSC based on CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe shows a smaller lower frequency than that based on CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS, which may be due to the higher recombination of electrons with the polysulfide electrolyte. These results show that the internal resistance at the TiO2/electrolyte interface in the QDSSC is a crucial factor for the performance of the cell.52,53

The mechanism underlying the photovoltaic performance improvement of the CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe QDSSCs was further investigated by measuring the recombination resistance (Rrec) and chemical capacitance (Cμ) of the devices as a function of bias voltage. These were calculated from the fitted results shown in Fig. 9c and d. Higher recombination resistance and chemical capacitance (Cμ) were obtained in the CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe QDSSCs, indicating a suppressed recombination process with more efficient electron transfer. This in turn improves the performance compared to the CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS QDSSC.54 The CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS QDSSC showed decreased charge transfer resistance and chemical capacitance, which may be due to the high recombination of electrons with the electrolyte. This tends to reduce the electron injection and the shift in the Fermi level towards the conduction band energy.50
The CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe QDSSC was illuminated continuously in a solar simulator with a light intensity of 1.5 G at 100 mW cm−2 for 10 h. The photovoltaic parameters (Voc: open-circuit voltage; Jsc: short-circuit photocurrent density; FF: fill factor; η: power conversion efficiency) of the CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe QDSSC were measured every 1 h for 10 h. The change in photovoltaic parameters is presented in Fig. 10. After light soaking, the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell significantly increases from 5.67% to 5.88%, which is related to the enhanced penetration of the polysulfide electrolyte through the complete thickness of the electrode and the “activation” of the entire electrode.55 There is a slight improvement in Voc from 0.584 to 0.592 V, while Jsc was improved from 17.59 to 17.73 mA cm−2 and FF was improved from 0.552 to 0.560 in the 10 h of illumination. The CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe cell has outstanding stability with no measurable degradation of the initial performance in the course of 10 h of irradiation. To the best of our knowledge, this stability performance is the best ever achieved for a QDSSC based on a CdS–CdSe electrode.

Though the photovoltaic performances for different photoanodes have been calculated and discussed above, all the QDSSCs based on different photoanodes used similar CuS counter electrodes and polysulfide electrolytes. The lowest FF was obtained with the Mn-doped electrodes. Previous results show that the counter electrodes have a significant influence on the FF of the solar cells.56 The FF of the Mn–ZnS and Mn–ZnSe electrodes may be improved upon replacing the CuS counter electrode with any other metal sulfide counter electrodes. However, the Mn-doped ZnS and Mn-doped ZnSe electrodes exhibited the highest Jsc and PCE compared with the previously reported photoanodes.31,40 The order of the PCE is CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe > CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS > CdS–CdSe–ZnSe > CdS–CdSe–ZnS. The doping of Mn into the ZnSe shows superior performance to that of Mn-doping into ZnS. For the first time, the pores of the CdS–CdSe QDs are completely filled with a thick layer of Mn–ZnSe. The high performance of CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe is due to the fact that the Mn–ZnSe layer acts as a blocking layer to retard the recombination at the interface of the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte. Also, the increased Voc, Jsc, FF and η are believed to be related mainly to the absorption range of the CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe QDs in the UV-region as well as the Mn–ZnSe layer may reduce further recombination and contribute to obtain a superior photovoltaic performance.
4. Conclusions
The results show that cascade structures of CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS and CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe can be used as photoelectrodes to improve the performance of QDSSCs. However, the efficiency of a CdS–CdSe–ZnSe-sensitized solar cell is strongly dependent on the passivation layer type and Mn doping therein. The device with CdS–CdSe–ZnS generated an η of 3.82%, whereas that with CdS–CdSe–ZnSe generated an η of 4.22%. Interestingly, the overall power conversion efficiency increases noticeably after introducing the Mn doping in the passivation layer.
As a result, the QDSSC based on the CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS photoanode achieved an efficiency of 5.17% and a Jsc of 17.34 mA cm−2. Also, the introduction of the Mn–ZnSe passivation layer improved the electron transportation rate and decreased the recombination, improving the electron lifetime and photovoltaic performance (PCE: 5.67%; Jsc: 17.59 mA cm−2). The investigation of the charge transport in the photoanode by transient photovoltage decay and phase plots confirmed that the effective electron lifetime was improved with Mn–ZnSe coating compared to the cell with Mn–ZnS, ZnSe, and ZnS coatings. The large accumulation of photo-injected carriers in the conduction band of the photoanode and lower recombination of photo-generated electrons with the electrolyte in CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe were confirmed by impedance analysis. The enhancement in the photo-electrochemical performance with quantum-dot sensitization of TiO2 is another milestone for achieving higher photo-conversion efficiencies of 5.67%. This novel approach is potentially extendable to other QD sensitizers and provides a path for further development of this low-cost photovoltaic technology.
