    , Accepted 12th January 2013First published on 16th January 2013AbstractA novel porous fluorine doped tin oxide (PFTO) conductive framework was introduced to counter electrodes (CEs) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). When modified by platinum (Pt) or carbon (C), the PFTO conductive framework displays high catalytic activity to I−/I3− redox couples. Power conversion efficiencies of 6.09% and 5.81% were obtained in the DSSCs based on Pt and C modified PFTO CEs respectively, which were close to that of DSSCs with Pt coated FTO glass (6.05%) and Pt sheet (6.26%) CEs. Maximum limiting performances of the CEs were obtained from the polarization curves. The CE based on PFTO showed higher maximum limiting power conversion efficiency (∼20%) compared with the planar FTO substrate Pt CE (∼18%), with the increase of its surface area and electrocatalytic activity.
Introduction
After two decades of development, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have reached a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of about 12%,1 which shows their great potential as a low-cost photovoltaic energy conversion device. As a photoelectrochemical solar cell, a DSSC typically contains a dye-sensitized photoanode, a counter electrode (CE) and an electrolyte containing iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couples.2 Absorption and conversion of incident sunlight are carried out in the photoanode where the dye molecules play an important role. The electrons are collected in the CE from the external circuit and transferred to the redox couples in the electrolyte under the effect of the electrocatalyst. Then, the electric charges are transferred to the photoanode in the electrolyte between the photoanode and the CE. The charge transfer rate between the CE and the electrolyte is one of the key factors for the photocurrent of the solar cell. To improve the cell's performance, platinum (Pt) is most commonly used as the catalyst in CEs. However, as a noble metal which has low crustal content, Pt significantly leads to the high cost of DSSCs. Therefore, much work to reduce the amount of Pt usage in DSSCs and a search for alternatives to Pt have been done in recent years. Some substitutes have been developed: carbonaceous materials such as active carbon,3 carbon nanotubes,4,5 graphene,6,7 some compounds of transition metals,8–12 polymers,13,14etc.
To improve the catalytic reaction on the interface of the electrolyte and the CE, some criteria for the CE materials can be summarized as follows.
(1) High catalytic activity to the redox couples. Materials with high catalytic activity would produce enough catalytic sites for redox couples even though a small amount of the active materials are loaded on the CE. To take Pt as an example, as Pt has high catalytic activity for I−/I3− redox reactions, it shows good performance even though there is just a thin Pt film on the conductive substrate.15
(2) High surface area. To take porous carbon as an example, although it does not have as high a catalytic activity as Pt, the high surface area provides a large contact area with the electrolyte.16
(3) Good electronic conductivity. The electrons in the substrate of the CEs should be transferred to the surface of the catalyst, so good electronic conductivity is required in CEs. Therefore, some materials with good conductivity were proven to have good performance such as carbon nanofibers17 and conductive polymers.13,14
Besides, in order to be widely applied in the CEs of DSSCs, the catalytic materials should be abundant in the crust, easy to fabricate, stable in the work environment and so on.
However, few substitutes have such good catalytic activity as Pt, so it is important to increase the contact surface area between the electrolyte and the CE materials. The most common method to improve the electrolyte–CE contact surface is to increase the thickness of the porous catalyst film. However, with the improvement of the thickness, the conductivity and stability of the film will be decreased. Take active carbon for example, in order to obtain performance comparable to Pt CEs, the thickness of the film should reach as high as tens of micrometers.18 Some work has been done to improve the stability of the carbon CE like introducing TiO2 to the film as a binder.19,20 However, TiO2 as a wide band gap semiconductor would inevitably increase the resistance of CEs.
In order to fabricate CEs with high electronic conductivity and high surface area, herein we first differentiated the processes of catalysis and charge transport by introducing porous fluorine doped tin oxide (PFTO) to the CEs as a conductive framework. The charge transport takes place in the conductive framework while the catalysis reaction takes place in the active materials. As is well known, FTO is widely used as a transparent conductive layer in the field of solar cells,2 electroluminescent devices,21 flat panel displays,22 electrochromic devices,23 sensors,24etc. In this work, FTO nanoparticles were prepared by the sol–gel process.25 The nanoparticles were fabricated into a porous film as a conductive framework, and then modified by an electrocatalyst (Pt and C in this paper). The as-prepared electrodes were applied in DSSCs as CEs. After electrochemical testing, we found the as-prepared CEs had a high performance in DSSCs close to Pt and had few negative effects on DSSCs fabricated at the present stage.
Experimental
Fabrication of FTO nanoparticles and preparation of Pt, C modified PFTO CEs
FTO nanoparticles were fabricated via the sol–gel method. Typically, 6.5 g SnCl4·5H2O was dissolved completely in 10 mL deionized water by stirring for 15 min. Subsequently, 1 mL HF aqueous solution (40 wt%) was added under stirring for fluorine doping. After stirring for another 15 min, NH4OH aqueous solution (90 wt%) was added to the mixture drop by drop under continued stirring until the solution turned to a gel. By drying in air at 120 °C for one night, a dry gel was obtained. After being calcined in air at 650 °C for 30 minutes, FTO nanoparticles were formed via a self-assembly process.22
The as-prepared FTO nanopowders were mixed with terpineol (AP) and ethyl cellulose ethanol solution (10 wt%) in the weight ratio of 1:2:4. The mixture was mixed uniformly by ball milling in a planetary muller (Nanda instrument plant, Nanjing) for 4 hours and the final paste was obtained after removing the ethanol in a rotary evaporator (6 kPa, 40 °C, ∼20 min). The paste was coated on the FTO glass (14 Ω sq−1, NSG, Japan) by doctor blading.
The fabrication processes of Pt or C modified PFTO CEs are shown in Scheme 1. To prepare Pt modified PFTO CEs (FTO-PFTO-Pt), the FTO glass coated with FTO paste was heated in air at 500 °C for 30 minutes. When cooled to room temperature the electrodes were immersed in 0.02 M H2PtCl6·6H2O ethanol solution for one hour and then heated in air at 380 °C for 30 minutes. For comparison, Pt modified porous TiO2 film CEs (FTO-PTiO2-Pt) were prepared by a similar method. The only difference was replacing the FTO nanopowders with TiO2 nanopowders (P25, Degussa, Germany, average size of 25 nm). To prepare C modified PFTO CEs (FTO-PFTO-C), the FTO glass coated with FTO paste was heated in a nitrogen atmosphere with a temperature increase from room temperature to 500 °C within 50 minutes and kept at 500 °C for 30 minutes. The electrodes turned black when the cellulose carbonized to C particles and the C modified PFTO film was obtained.

TiO2 photoanode and DSSC fabrication
The TiO2 paste was purchased from Solaronix SA, Aubonne, Switzerland. The TiO2 paste was coated onto FTO glass by doctor blading and heated in air at 500 °C for 30 minutes. When cooled to 80 °C, the electrodes were immersed in an N719 dye ethanol solution for 20 hours. An acetonitrile solution containing 0.06 M LiI, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate was used as the electrolyte. The sensitized TiO2 electrodes were assembled to form sandwich-type DSSCs with the as-prepared CEs. For comparison, DSSCs based on Pt sheet (Pt) and Pt sputtered FTO glass (FTO-Pt) CEs were prepared.
Characterization
The size and morphology of the FTO nanoparticles were studied by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM, FEI NOVA NanoSEM230, USA). The crystallinity was characterized by X-ray diffraction (ARL X'TRA, Switzerland, CuKα, λ = 1.540562 Å). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and porosity were measured on a Tristar micromeritics surface area and porosity analyzer. The composition of the powder and the element distribution in the film were determined by X-ray energy-dispersion spectroscopy (EDX, EX-250, HORIBA, France). The surface composition was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI-5000C ESCA system). Pt and C modified FTO nanoparticles were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 200CX, Japan). The thickness of the CE was determined by the DEKTAK 150 Profilometer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of symmetrical cells was observed with an electrochemical workstation (PAR2273, Princeton Applied Research, USA) at a frequency range 50 mHz to 100 kHz. The symmetrical cells were fabricated with two identical electrodes, whose areas were 0.25 cm2. Polarization curves of the symmetrical cells were tested with a digital sourcemeter (Keithley 236, USA). DSSCs were tested with a Keithley 236 sourcemeter under AM 1.5 illumination from a sunlight simulator (Oriel 92251A-1000, Newport, USA).
Results and discussion
The as-prepared FTO nanocrystals were analyzed by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 1a, the sizes of the nanoparticles are between 20 nm and 30 nm without obvious aggregation. The XRD patterns of the crystal particles are present in Fig. 1b. The peaks show a cassiterite phase which is the same as the phase of SnO2 in FTO glass. The results of X-ray energy-dispersion spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are displayed in Fig. 1c and d respectively, and both indicate that the powder contains a fluorine element. Moreover, the XPS shows F 1s signals which can be assigned to the formation of Sn–F complexes in the SnO2. These indicate that FTO nanocrystals with good dispersity were synthesized.

To determine the morphology and distribution of electrocatalysts in the PFTO framework, TEM and EDX maps were carried out. TEM images are shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2a, Pt adheres on FTO particles as smaller particles about 5 nm in size, while the C (Fig. 2b) is coated onto FTO particles as a thin coating layer. In both cases the active materials are uniformly distributed in the PFTO film.

To determine the surface area and porosity of PFTO and Pt, C modified PFTO, nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiments were performed. The detailed report of the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms for the samples is summarized in Table S1.† The BET surface area calculated from the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. 3a) of the PFTO, Pt modified PFTO and C modified PFTO are 42.54 m2 g−1, 43.86 m2 g−1 and 75.33 m2 g−1, respectively. The BET surface area has no significant increase when modified by Pt, as the Pt particles with few pores adhere on the surface of the FTO particles. However, the BET surface area increases from 42.54 m2 g−1 to 75.33 m2 g−1 in the presence of carbon particles when modified by carbon. Fig. 3b shows the Barrett–Johner–Halenda (BJH) desorption pore size distribution curves of the samples. From the curves, BJH desorption cumulative volumes of pores were calculated to be 0.29 cm3 g−1 for PFTO, 0.26 cm3 g−1 for PFTO-Pt and 0.24 cm3 g−1 for PFTO-C. These indicate that when modified by Pt and C, some pore volume in PFTO was occupied by Pt and C particles. The most probable pore size is ca. 31.5 nm for the samples. In the counter electrode, a big pore diameter is expected to transport the ions in the electrolyte.

Fig. 4a and b show the top view SEM image and EDX map of the Pt modified PFTO electrode, respectively. From the SEM image we can see that the film consists of nanoparticles with large numbers of micropores. The morphology is similar to the TiO2 porous film in the photoanode which is known as an important point to improve the performance of DSSCs.2 Similarly, CEs with this morphology can offer a large interface area between the electrode and the electrolyte which will improve the exchange current through the interface. The top view and cross-section EDX map (Fig. 4b and d) indicate that the Pt particles are homogeneously spread over the entire FTO film transversely and longitudinally. When calcined in a nitrogen atmosphere, cellulose turned to C particles and the film turned to a C modified porous film. From the SEM and EDX map image (Fig. 4e–h) we can see that the film has a porous morphology and the C element spreads over the film homogeneously.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is one of the most common and effective methods to study the charge transfer resistance (RCT) between a CE and electrolyte which is widely used to illustrate the catalytic activity of the CE materials. Fig. 5 shows the Nyquist plots of the symmetrical cells fabricated with two electrodes of Pt, FTO-Pt, FTO-PFTO-Pt, FTO-PFTO-C and FTO-PTiO2-Pt, respectively, and the inset gives the equivalent circuit. Typically, the Nyquist plots of symmetrical cells contain two semicircles: the semicircle in the high frequency region (the first semicircle) corresponds to the charge transfer resistance at the CE–electrolyte interface, and the other one corresponds to the Warburg diffusion process of ions in the electrolyte (ZW). Besides, from the intercept at the high frequency we can get series resistance (RS) of the counter electrode. The values of RCT and RS are shown in Table 1. RCT of the Pt and C modified PFTO films are 0.48 Ω cm2 and 0.51 Ω cm2, respectively, which are obviously smaller than those of planar Pt electrodes (1.34 Ω cm2 of Pt and 1.88 Ω cm2 of FTO-Pt). This can be explained by the increase of the interface between the active materials and the electrolyte due to the increased surface area of the CEs when nanoscale active materials adhere on the porous film with high roughness. The series resistance of Pt coated on FTO glass is 1.75 Ω cm2, which is larger than that (0.79 Ω cm2) of a Pt sheet. This can be attributed to a larger sheet resistance of the FTO glass than that of a Pt sheet. For FTO-PFTO-Pt and FTO-PFTO-C CEs, besides the resistance of the FTO glass, the resistance of the PFTO film should be considered, consequently the RS of which is 2.52 Ω cm2 and 2.75 Ω cm2 respectively.

In a DSSC, the electron transfer processes in the photoanode–electrolyte interface, electrolyte interior, and electrolyte–CE interface are in series (Fig. 6). For series processes, the reaction rate is determined by the rate-determining step, which is the one with the smallest rate in an electrochemical system. To determine which part is the rate-determining step, we treat the CE and electrolyte as one part (named A) and the photoanode as the other part (named B), and let the potential of the photoanode–electrolyte interface be 0 (see the “0” point in Fig. 6). When the DSSC works in short circuit, the photovoltage is applied to A directly and the potential of CE is −VOC. While in open circuit, the voltage applied to A is zero. That is to say the potential of CE ranges from 0 to −VOC. Therefore, if we replace the photoanode with a CE to assemble a symmetrical cell and measure the polarization curve from 0 to −VOC, the polarization curve will approximately show us the maximum limiting current of A in its work situation.
 Fig. 6  The schematic of electronic migration and electrical potential distribution in an equivalent DSSC circuit. 

Fig. 7 shows polarization curves of different CEs and a J–V curve of an integrated DSSC with a PCE of 6.26%. The horizontal axis represents the potential of the CE. When the potential is close to 0, the slope of the polarization curve is the reciprocal of the sum of RCT and RS, as shown in eqn (1), where J and φ are the current density and the potential of the electrode, F is Faraday's constant, J0 is the exchange current density in the CE–electrolyte interface, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature and n is the number of electrons contributing to the charge transfer. From Fig. 7 we can obtain the slope near zero point and consequently get the value of RS + RCT. As shown in Table 1, the value of RS + RCT follows the order of Pt (2.24 Ω cm2) < FTO-PFTO-Pt (3.47 Ω cm2) < FTO-PFTO-C (3.93 Ω cm2) < FTO-Pt (4.09 Ω cm2), which is in accordance with that from EIS. (1)
 Fig. 7  Polarization curves of symmetrical cells fabricated with two of the same electrode fabricated with a Pt sheet (Pt), Pt coating FTO glass (FTO-Pt), C (FTO-PFTO-C) and Pt (FTO-PFTO-Pt) modified PFTO on FTO glass, Pt modified porous TiO2 on FTO glass (FTO-PTiO2-Pt). The dotted curve is a J–V curve of a DSSC with a PCE of 6.26%, the voltage of which is changed to the corresponding potential. 
Except for FTO-PTiO2-Pt, all other CEs have a higher current than the photoanode from −VOC to 0. This means that when DSSCs work, the rate-determining section is the photoanode, and the CE has few negative effects on the as-prepared DSSC's performance, until the maximum limiting current of the photoanode is large enough to make the CE the rate-determining section. When the CE becomes the rate-determining section, the J–V curve should be close to the polarization curve shown in Fig. 7. As discussed above, when a DSSC works in short circuit, the potential of the CE is −VOC. Thus from the polarization curves we can read the JSC, and we can obtain the maximum limiting power conversion efficiency (PCElim) of the DSSC based on eqn (2), where Pmax is the power the cell puts out when working at the maximum power point, and Pin and Iin are the power and intensity of the incident light. We assume that the VOC is 0.8 V and Iin is 100 mW cm−2. Then the PCElim of the corresponding CE was obtained. As shown in Table 1, with PFTO as the conductive framework, a higher PCElim was obtained in Pt (20.25%) and C (19.58%) modified PFTO CEs compared to the planar Pt on FTO glass (17.58%). For comparison, FTO-PTiO2-Pt CE has a small initial slope in the polarization curve due to the large resistance of TiO2 porous film. This will lead to a low fill factor of the DSSC based on the CE as shown in Fig. 8 and Table 1. (2)
 Fig. 8  
J–V curves of DSSCs fabricated with Pt, FTO-PFTO-Pt, FTO-PFTO-C, FTO-Pt and FTO-PTiO2-Pt CEs. 
The J–V curves of DSSCs based on the as-prepared CEs are shown in Fig. 8 and the performance parameters are shown in Table 1. The J–V curves indicate that J–V performances of Pt sheet, FTO-PFTO-Pt and FTO-PFTO-C CEs are almost the same. The slight promotion of the JSC and PCE of the Pt sheet is due to the smooth surface of the Pt sheet which can reflect the transmitted light through the work electrode and then bring about a secondary absorption. This demonstrates that high-performance CEs have few negative effects on the DSSCs' performance. For the FTO-PTiO2-Pt CE, the high resistance reduces the CE's performance, and leads to a low FF in the DSSC. When the DSSC based on FTO-PTiO2-Pt CE works at open circuit, the output voltage of the cell is VOC and the potential of the CE is 0 V. As the cell's output voltage decreases, the potential on the CE becomes more negative. At the same time, the current density through the photoanode and electrolyte–CE interface would increase, and the former is larger (Fig. 7). In this case, the rate-determining section is the electrolyte–CE interface, so the integrated current density is close to its maximum current density. Thus the smaller slope of its polarization curve would lead to a lower FF in the J–V curve of the DSSC (Fig. 8).
The thickness of the Pt and C modified PFTO CEs discussed above are 13.23 and 23.62 μm, respectively. CEs with different thicknesses were also studied. For Pt modified PFTO CEs, with the increase of thickness, the loading of Pt will consequently increase, but the electrolyte will find more difficulty in permeating through the film. As a result, the electrochemical performances do not have a significant change when the thickness increases from several micrometres to more than 60 micrometres. The detailed performance parameters are summarized in Fig. S1 and Table S2.† As for C modified PFTO CEs, the performance decreases when the thickness increases due to the small average pore width (11.21 nm, Table S1†) of C modified PFTO which is not conducive to ion transport in the CE. The detailed performance parameters of PFTO-C CEs are summarized in Fig. S2 and Table S3.†
Conclusion
In summary, FTO nanocrystals with sizes ranging from 20 to 30 nm were synthesized via the sol–gel method. The as-synthesized FTO nanocrystals were fabricated into a porous film as the conductive framework and modified by Pt and C. Compared to planar Pt CEs, Pt and C modified PFTO framework CEs show lower RCT and higher limiting diffusion current density for the increase of roughness. Herein limited by the photoanodes, DSSCs based on the as-prepared Pt and C modified PFTO CEs obtained a PCE of 6.09% and 5.81%, respectively, compared with that (6.05%) of FTO-Pt cells and that (6.26%) of Pt sheet cells. To determine which part mainly limits the performance of DSSCs between the photoanode and the CE, maximum limiting performance of CEs was developed. FTO-PFTO-Pt shows a high PCElim (20.25%), which is higher than that (20.12%) of a Pt sheet CE and that (17.58%) of a FTO-Pt CE. According to the maximum limiting performance, for the most efficient DSSC (lower than 12%) to date, the power conversion efficiency is limited by the photoanodes, which more or less tells us to be more circumspect to make a conclusion that a novel CE is better than Pt CE based on the power conversion efficiency.
