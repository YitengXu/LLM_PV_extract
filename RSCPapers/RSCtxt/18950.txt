    , Accepted 6th February 2015First published on 9th February 2015AbstractTernary ZnxCd1−xSe alloys are potential materials for sensitized photovoltaic devices because of their tunable bandgaps and band structures. In this work, random deposition of Cd and Zn was realized by the co-evaporated chemical vapor deposition method to tune the distribution of the lattice constant and the mixing of the structural phase to the utmost, and thus release the misfit stress by the self-adaption mechanism. As a result, the coaxial nanowire with an approximate composition x of 0.5 exhibited the high crystal quality and the long nonequilibrium carrier lifetime because of the alloy disorder effect. The corresponding photo-electrochemical cell acquired a power conversion efficiency of 3.68%. This work paves the way for the design and development of high-efficiency coaxial solar cells based on ternary or multi-component alloys.
1. Introduction
Recently, photovoltaic devices have been a subject of great interest due to the growing awareness of energy shortage and environmental protection.1,2 Many studies have focused on increasing the efficiency of solar cells or photo-electrochemical (PEC) cells using oxide semiconductors, such as ZnO and TiO2.3–8 These oxide semiconductors have large and fixed bandgaps, which individually cannot efficiently absorb sunlight in the visible region and result in a low efficiency. An alternate strategy of coating nanowires (NWs) with narrow bandgap semiconductors, such as ZnSe, CdSe, CdS, PbSe, and ZnCdSe, has been applied to extend their absorptions into the visible region.9–16 As compared to the binary materials, the ternary alloy ZnCdSe has the advantage of a tunable bandgap by controlling its composition,17–24 which allows it to achieve higher absorption and more suitable band structures, resulting in improved conversion efficiency. In spite of these advantages, the low crystal quality in the ZnxCd1−xSe shell shall diminish cell efficiency. Many efforts have been devoted to improve the crystal quality and optimize the band structure.22–24 For instances, Y. Myung et al. fabricated polytypic ZnxCd1−xSe shell layers on ZnO nanowire arrays by the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method and showed a maximum solar efficiency of 1.5% at x = 0.3;23 whereas, L. Yang et al. reported ZnxCd1−xSe quantum-dot-sensitized TiO2 solar cells based on the ion-exchange method and showed the best performance at a relatively high composition of x = 0.6 due to efficient band alignment.24 Until now, the relationship between the crystal quality and alloy growth technique as well as compositions is still not clear. In comparison with aforementioned methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is expected to achieve better crystal quality due to the high growth temperature and high purity of atoms.25 However, due to the challenge of the controllable composition, there are very few reports on the synthesis of the alloy shell directly by the CVD method.
In this work, we synthesized ZnO/ZnxCd1−xSe coaxial NWs with a tunable shell composition (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) directly by the CVD method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission analysis, and time resolved photo-luminescence (TRPL) were performed to investigate morphologies, crystal quality, interfacial structures, and optical properties of coaxial NWs. Solar cells based on different ZnO/ZnxCd1−xSe NWs were assembled. A maximal efficiency of 3.68% was achieved at x = 0.51. The mechanism for improved efficiency was discussed as well.
2. Experimental section
Synthesis of ZnO NWs
The growth of vertically well-aligned ZnO NWs on the aluminum zinc oxide (AZO) substrate was carried out in a horizontal quartz tube furnace with three heating zones. High purity metallic zinc powder (5 N, 1.0 g) was used as the source material and placed at the central heating zone of the quartz tube. The substrate with the dimensions of 1.0 cm × 1.5 cm was placed at a distance of 7.5 cm downstream of the Zn powder. Before heating, the system was evacuated to 1.0 × 10−2 Pa, and a mixed gas consisting of 100 sccm N2 flow and 8 sccm O2 flow was introduced into the tube. Then, the tube was heated to 580 °C at a rate of 20 °C min−1 and maintained at this temperature for 30 minutes.
Shell growth on ZnO NWs
To coat the ZnCdSe shell layer on the ZnO NWs, high purity metallic Zn powder (5 N) was mixed with Cd powder (5 N) physically and positioned at the central zone of the quartz tube. The shell composition was controlled by changing the ratio between Zn and Cd powders. Considering the lower melting point of Se than that of Zn and Cd, the Se powder (5 N, 0.2 g) was placed at the first zone, upstream of Zn and Cd powders. The system was evacuated again and then only 200 sccm N2, as a carrier gas, was flowed through the tube. The heating zones were heated at a rate of 20 °C min−1. During the ZnCdSe shell growth, the temperature of the first zone was maintained at 410 °C while the central zone at 460 °C. After growth, the system was naturally cooled down to room temperature.
Device fabrication
For photovoltaic applications, the as-prepared coaxial NWs were used as working electrodes and nanostructured Cu2S was used as the counter electrode, which was prepared by immersing a brass sheet in HCl solution (37 wt%) at 70 °C for 5 minutes and subsequently dipping it into a polysulfide solution (1.0 M S, 1.0 M Na2S and 0.1 M NaOH in deionized water) for 5 minutes.26,27 The two electrodes were separated by a 60 μm-thick polymer film and the internal space of the cell was filled with polysulfide electrolyte. The active area of the solar cell was about 0.20 cm2.
Characterization
Morphologies of the as-prepared ZnO and ZnO/ZnCdSe NWs were characterized by field emission SEM (LEO 1530, operating at 20 kV). The structures and compositions were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku R-Axis Spider), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Tecnai F30, operating at 300 kV), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The transmission spectra were recorded by using a Varian Cary 300 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. TRPL measurements were carried out using an Edinburgh FLS920 spectrofluorometer at room temperature. The detected energies for different samples were in accordance with their estimated bandgaps (1.74 eV, 1.92 eV, 2.10 eV, 2.32 eV, 2.51 eV, and 2.67 eV). Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of solar cells were measured under AM1.5 solar illumination (100 mW cm−2). An Agilent B2912A was used as the ammeter in the J–V measurement. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured on a broadband spectroscopy system consisting of a grating monochromator (Acton Research Corporation, Spectra Pro-750i), a 100 W bromine–tungsten lamp, and a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR830 DSP), by comparing with the reference Si and Ge cells.
3. Results and discussion
The morphologies of bare ZnO NWs and coaxial NWs were first observed by SEM. Fig. 1(a) shows the top view of aligned ZnO NWs, demonstrating the high growth density and smooth surface along the entire length (seeing inset). Fig. 1(b) shows the SEM image of as-prepared ZnO/Zn0.51Cd0.49Se NWs. The top hexagonal structure changes into a round shape, indicating the formation of a shell layer. The inset in Fig. 1(b) is a magnified cross-sectional view of a coaxial nanowire. The rough surface clearly demonstrates that shell is deposited successfully over the entire ZnO nanowire. For the samples with different compositions, they are almost of the same morphologies and are not presented here.

To examine their structures and compositions, we performed XRD measurements on these samples. Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD spectra of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xSe NWs with different compositions x. For all the patterns, there is a sharp peak at around 34.5°, which is assigned to a ZnO wurtzite (WZ) hexagonal structure, demonstrating the preferential orientation along the [0001] direction. As for the ZnO/ZnSe NWs (x = 1), the peak around 27.23° is correlated with (111) planes of zinc blende (ZB) ZnSe. With the decrease of Zn content, the diffraction peaks of ZnCdSe gradually shift to smaller angles due to the increased lattice spacing by exchanging Zn atoms with Cd atoms. Meanwhile, the number of peaks gradually increases, and three peaks at 23.92°, 25.42°, and 27.14° are clearly observed for ZnO/CdSe NWs, which are indexed to (100), (002) and (101) planes of WZ CdSe, respectively. The evolution of XRD patterns originates from different stable phase structures of ZB and WZ for ZnSe and CdSe, respectively. According to the position and intensity of the WZ(002) or ZB(111) peaks, we calculated the average composition x with the help of Vegard's law,28–31 which is 0.33, 0.51, 0.72, and 0.86, respectively. Fig. 2(b) shows the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of (002) or (111) peaks of ZnCdSe shell layers. The width of ternary alloys is relatively larger than that of binary ZnSe or CdSe, and a maximal value appears at x = 0.51, which means that the crystal quality and structure significantly depend on the content of Zn or Cd elements. In order to reveal the intrinsic mechanism, we plotted the dependence of WZ phase ratio on composition x. Clearly, the phase structure gradually transforms from ZB to WZ with the decrease of Zn content, and the position of phase variation appears at 0.4 < x < 0.8, which is almost similar to other reports.32,33 It is known that binary ZnSe and CdSe are quite different in the lattice constant and phase structure, resulting in the appearance of strain states and precipitation of different phases in ternary ZnCdSe alloys. On gradual mixing of Cd elements with ZnSe materials, the stress increases, which leads to FWHM broadening (see Fig. 2(b)) and appearance of the WZ phase (see Fig. 2(c)). When the ratio of Zn to Cd is approximately 1:1 (x = 0.51), a random arrangement of Cd and Zn creates the greatest disorder to the elements in the immediate neighbor as well as the distant neighbor positions of the lattice structure. In this case, the distribution of the lattice constant reached the widest status, leading to the maximal FWHM; meanwhile, each WZ and ZB structure takes almost half the phase.

To elucidate the structure of NWs after coating the ZnCdSe shell layer, more detailed investigations were conducted by TEM and EDS. Fig. 3(a) shows the low magnification TEM image of a ZnO/ZnSe nanowire. It is fully covered with a uniform shell layer, demonstrating the core/shell structure. Fig. 3(b) shows the EDS line-scan profile along the line marked in Fig. 3(a). The Zn element distributes over the whole core and shell region, while the O and Se appear in the core and shell regions, respectively, which confirms the ZnO/ZnSe coaxial nanowire. To understand the detailed structure, HRTEM was conducted and the results are shown in Fig. 3(c). The core is identified to be WZ ZnO with a [0001] growth direction and an interplanar spacing of 0.52 nm, while the shell corresponds to ZB ZnSe with [111] growth direction and an interplanar spacing of 0.324 nm. Due to the large lattice mismatch between the ZnO (0001) plane and ZnSe (111) plane, a rotation of about 54° is observed between these two directions. This behavior is different from the coherent growth reported in our previous work due to the lower growth temperature.9

Fig. 4(a) corresponds to the TEM image of a ZnO/CdSe nanowire, revealing its core/shell structure. The EDS line-scan profile in Fig. 4(b) identifies the Cd and Se elements in the shell, and the Zn and O elements in the core regions, respectively. The HRTEM image of the interface region for the ZnO/CdSe nanowire is presented in Fig. 4(c). The lattice spacing of the shell layer is measured to be 0.35 nm, which agrees well with that of bulk WZ CdSe in the c-axis direction (JCPDS 77-2307). There is only a slightly tilt of about 5° between the WZ CdSe [0001] direction and WZ ZnO [0001] direction, almost demonstrating an epitaxial growth. Note that the CdSe shell layer is almost defect-free and exhibits a good crystal quality; however, obvious defects can be found in the interfacial ZnO region with about 4 nm thickness (strained ZnO region marked in Fig. 4(c)) because the large mismatch stress (a lattice mismatch of 26%) is almost accommodated in the ZnO interfacial layer. These interfacial defects will significantly affect the charge separation and then cell efficiency, which will be discussed later.

For the ZnO/ZnxCd1−xSe NWs with different x values, as revealed in XRD patterns, they are of polycrystalline in structure. Here, we choose the ZnO/Zn0.51Cd0.49Se NWs as an example to get insight into the details. Fig. 5(a) and (b) are the low magnification TEM image and EDS line-scan profile, respectively, confirming its ZnO/ZnCdSe coaxial structure. Interestingly, the HRTEM image shown in Fig. 5(c) exhibits a structure which is different from that in Fig. 3(c) and 4(c). The shell is composed of multiple grains with a slightly different lattice constant due to strained inducement and the alloy disorder effect (or element random distribution). Just because of this, most mismatch stress can be automatically adjusted by local composition variation and phase transition during growth and released by the interfaces between grains. In this case, despite of large mismatch between the core and the shell, a thin coherent layer with WZ structure grows on the interface because of the aforestated stress release mechanism, demonstrating the high crystal quality. As reported by Y. Myung,23 the ZnO/ZnxCd1−xSe nanowire with a similar composition (x = 0.5) showed a WZ-ZB superlattice structure in the z-axis direction, demonstrating a large composition variation in the shell region. This behavior also reveals that the synthesis of ternary compound directly by the element co-evaporation method used in our work is beneficial for the alloy disordered distribution and release of mismatch stress.

Fig. 6(a) shows the photographs of the ZnO/ZnxCd1−xSe NWs with different compositions x. The sample color gradually changes from dark (ZnO/CdSe) to red (ZnxCd1−xSe) and then to yellow (ZnO/ZnSe), demonstrating the graded composition. The corresponding bandgaps were further investigated by transmission measurements. The bandgap of each sample was estimated from the intersection point of two fitting lines, i.e. the saturation and inclined line marked in Fig. 6(b). The bandgap values of ZnSe and CdSe NWs are 2.67 eV and 1.74 eV, which are consistent with those of bulk WZ CdSe and bulk ZB ZnSe, respectively. Additionally, the absorption edge expands in the region from 2.67 eV to 1.74 eV with the decrease of Zn content, which almost covers the entire visible spectrum. The bandgaps of ternary alloys were estimated to be 1.92 eV, 2.1 eV, 2.32 eV and 2.51 eV for the composition x of 0.33, 0.51, 0.72 and 0.86, respectively. Note that there appears a relatively strong infrared absorption for the ZnO/Zn0.51Cd0.49Se NWs (marked in Fig. 6(b)), which is attributed to the type-II interfacial transition absorption due to the coherent structure.9Fig. 6(c) shows the dependence of the bandgap energy on composition x which demonstrates a significant variation from linearity. The nonlinearity was fitted by Eg(x) = Eg(CdSe) + (Eg(ZnSe) − Eg(CdSe) − b)x + bx2, where b is the bowing parameter. The least square fit yields b = 0.53 eV, which is slightly larger than that of bulk (0.41–0.48 eV) but lower than that obtained by Y. Myung (0.79 eV).23 It is known that the bowing parameter b in a mixed crystal of ABC reflects its miscibility between AC and BC alloys.33,34 In the light of this, the low b in our work revealed the relatively random element distribution, which is consistent with the discussion in Fig. 2 and 5(c).

We fabricated the PEC solar cells based on above different ZnO/ZnxCd1−xSe samples and evaluated their photovoltaic performances. Fig. 7 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells under AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2). The detailed performance parameters of the solar cells are listed in Table 1. The solar cell with the composition of x = 1 (ZnO/ZnSe) shows the lowest efficiency of 1.07% due to the largest bandgap and smallest light absorption. In principle, CdSe has the lowest bandgap and can absorb more sunlight than others. Hence, the ZnO/CdSe nanowire cell is expected to obtain the highest efficiency according to Shockley–Queisser detailed balance theory.35 However, the maximal performance was achieved in the ZnO/Zn0.51Cd0.49Se nanowire cell, which acquired a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.64 mA and an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.75 V, yielding an efficiency of 3.68%. The inset in Fig. 7 is its IPCE curve. The maximum IPCE of 51% is higher than the generally reported value of approximately 30%.23

To understand the mechanism of superior performance of the ZnO/Zn0.51Cd0.49Se nanowire cell, TRPL measurements were performed to gain the dynamic information on recombination and charge transport. The PL decay curves were fitted by a typical biexponential form to obtain the average lifetime τ.36 As shown in Fig. 8, the ZnO/Zn0.51Cd0.49Se NWs possess the longest lifetime, revealing the lowest recombination rate. Supposing that the diffusion coefficients (D) are the same in the ZnCdSe alloys, the longer lifetime means the longer diffusion length L () and thereby the higher charge separation and collection efficiency. As we know, the conversion efficiency of solar cells significantly relies not only on the light absorption range, but also on the charge collection efficiency. In this sense, the long carrier lifetime in ZnO/Zn0.51Cd0.49Se NWs dominantly contributed to the high conversion efficiency. Additionally, one can see that the average lifetime in the Zn-rich ternary alloy (x > 0.5) is shorter than that in the Cd-rich ternary alloy (x < 0.5). This is because the Zn-rich alloy has the larger conduction band offset, which provides the larger driving force for electron transfer,36,37 thus resulting in the shorter PL decay lifetime. Therefore, several factors, including effective bandgap, crystal quality, and band structure, etc., should be comprehensively considered to improve the performance of coaxial solar cells based on the ternary or multi-component alloy with different stable phase structures.

4. Conclusions
In summary, arrays of ZnO/ZnxCd1−xSe coaxial NWs with a tunable shell composition have been successfully synthesized via the co-evaporation CVD method. XRD results disclosed that the CVD method is beneficial for the random deposition of elements in the lattice structure, resulting in the wide distribution of the lattice constant and phase mixing. TEM measurements revealed that the mismatch stress can be automatically adjusted by local composition variation and phase transition during growth and released by the interfaces between grains. As a result, a coherent WZ interfacial layer was grown in the ZnO/Zn0.51Cd0.49Se nanowire. Transmission analysis indicated the tunable bandgap and low bowing parameter b, which demonstrated the relatively random element distribution in ternary alloys. TRPL measurements demonstrated that the ZnO/Zn0.51Cd0.49Se nanowire had the longest carrier lifetime, which was in favor of high charge collection efficiency. As a result, the corresponding cell acquired a maximal conversion efficiency of 3.68%. This work provides a strategy to design and develop high-efficiency coaxial solar cells based on ternary or multi-component alloys.
