    , Accepted 10th September 2014First published on 18th September 2014AbstractHeteroleptic trans-bis(alkylphosphine) platinum(II) bisacetylide complexes Pt-1 and Pt-2 were prepared to achieve broadband absorption of visible light. Two different ethynylBodipy ligands, 2-ethynylBodipy and 2,6-diethynylBodipy or 8-(4′-ethynylphenyl)Bodipy, were used in each complex. Each Bodipy ligand gives strong absorption in the visible spectral region, but at different wavelengths, thus broadband absorption in the visible spectral region was achieved for the Pt(II) complexes (ε is up to 1.85 × 105 M−1 cm−1 in the region of 450–700 nm). Singlet energy transfer from the peripheral coordinated Bodipy to the central coordinated Bodipy (with 2,6-diethynyl substitution) was confirmed by steady state absorption/luminescence spectroscopy, fluorescence excitation spectroscopy and nanosecond/femtosecond ultrafast time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. Long-lived triplet excited states were observed for both complexes (τT = 63.13 μs for Pt-1 and τT = 94.18 μs for Pt-2). Nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy indicated that the triplet excited state of Pt-1 is distributed on both Bodipy units. For Pt-2, however, the T1 state is confined to the central coordinated Bodipy ligand. These complexes show high singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yields (ΦΔ = 76.0%). With nanosecond pulsed laser excitation, delayed fluorescence was observed for the complexes (τDF = 43.8 μs for Pt-1 and τDF = 111.0 μs for Pt-2), which is rarely reported for transition metal complexes. The complexes were used as efficient multi-wavelength excitable triplet photosensitizers for triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion.
Introduction
Transition metal complexes have been used in photocatalysis, hydrogen production (H2), photoredox catalytic organic reactions, molecular devices, photodynamic therapy (PDT), non-linear optics, and electroluminescence,1–13 as well as in photochemistry studies, such as investigations of singlet or triplet exciton migration.14–16 Concerning these aspects, the Pt(II) complexes are of particular interest because of the efficient production of triplet excited states and the readily derivatizable molecular structures.17,18 Since most of the applications of these complexes are related to the triplet excited states, with which the consequential electron transfer or triplet energy transfer is initiated, the visible light harvesting ability and the lifetime of the T1 state of these complexes are crucial, because the above-mentioned intermolecular processes are capable of being enhanced with the abundant molecules at the excited states and the long-living triplet excited states. The weak absorption of conventional transition metal complexes may be attributed to the weakly allowed S0 → 1MLCT transition (charge transfer character).13 The visible light-absorbing ability is capable of being enhanced by switching the S0 → S1 transition to the S0 → 1IL (intraligand) transition, with the latter as a strongly allowed π–π* transition. In recent years Pt(II) complexes with visible light-harvesting ligands were reported.5,11 Our group reported Pt(II) complexes which contain visible light-harvesting ligands such as Bodipy, coumarin, naphthalenediimide, perylene bisimide, etc.13 These complexes show strong visible light absorption and long-lived triplet excited states, and have been used in triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion, photoredox catalytic organic reactions and photosensitization of singlet oxygen (1O2).13
We noted that a common disadvantage of these complexes is left to overcome, that is, there is usually only a single kind of visible light-harvesting ligand in these complexes, as a result, there is only one major absorption band in the visible spectral region.5,13,17 This is clearly a drawback if a panchromatic light source was used, such as solar light. Therefore, it is important to prepare Pt(II) complexes that show broadband absorption of visible light. This goal cannot be achieved by using the conventional molecular structural protocol based on using a single kind of visible light-harvesting ligand in the complex molecule.13
On the other hand, the trans-bis(alkylphosphine) platinum(II)-alkynyl complexes have attracted much attention.5,19–24 The molecular structure of these compounds can be easily modified by using different acetylide ligands, providing tunability of both the photophysical and redox properties.1,19 However, trans-bis(alkylphosphine) platinum(II)-alkynyl complexes showing strong visible light absorption were rarely reported.20,25,26 We have shown the rich triplet excited state-related photochemistry of organic fluorophores, such as Bodipy, coumarin, rhodamine, NDI and PBI with transition metal complexes,13 thus it is interesting to study the intramolecular excited state energy transfer with the trans-bis(alkylphosphine) platinum(II)-alkynyl complexes that contain organic chromophores.
In organic molecular dyads, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was very often used to achieve a broadband visible light absorption.27 However, to the best of our knowledge, this strategy was rarely used to achieve broadband visible light absorption in transition metal complexes.13,17,18 Recently we prepared a Pt(II) complex with Bodipy and naphthalenediimide ligands, but the absorption wavelength and intensity are not satisfactory.19
In this paper we propose a strategy to achieve broadband visible light-absorption in transitional metal complexes. Our method is exemplified with two heteroleptic trans-bis(alkylphosphine) platinum(II)-alkynyl complexes (Pt-1 and Pt-2, Scheme 1).5,19–24 For transition metal complexes containing multi-chromophores to achieve broadband absorption of visible light, it is important to control the direction of the singlet energy transfer so that the spin converter acts as the singlet energy acceptor to ensure efficient transformation of the photoexcitation energy into triplet state energy.13b,28,29
 Scheme 1  Pt(II) complexes used in the study. The known complex Pt-3 is also presented. 
Herein we prepared two heteroleptic trans-bis(alkylphosphine) platinum(II)-alkynyl complexes (Pt-1 and Pt-2, Scheme 1). In these complexes, different Bodipy units are connected to the Pt(II) atom either at the 2-position or the meso(4′-phenyl) position of the Bodipy unit, so that different absorption wavelengths and T1 state energy levels resulted, and intramolecular RET is ensured with the central 2,6-coordinated Bodipy moiety as the singlet energy acceptor, which is an efficient spin converter to produce triplet excited states.13b
With steady state and nanosecond or femtosecond ultrafast time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy techniques, we confirmed the singlet and triplet excited state energy transfer in these complexes. By nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy, we found that the triplet excited state of Pt-1 is delocalized on the three Bodipy ligands, due to degenerated T1 and T2 states, whereas in Pt-2 the triplet excited state is exclusively confined to one Bodipy ligand. Long-lived triplet excited states (τT is up to 94.18 μs) were observed for the complexes. The complexes were used as multi-wavelength excitable triplet photosensitizers for TTA upconversion.
Experimental section
Analytical measurements
All the chemicals used in synthesis were analytically pure and were used as received. Solvents were dried and distilled before synthesis. cis-Pt[P(n-Bu)3]2Cl2 was prepared according to a literature method,5 and the synthesis of compounds 1, 2, and 3 was reported previously.30,31

Complex Pt-a. 
Under an Ar atmosphere, compound 1 (34.8 mg, 0.1 mmol) and cis-Pt[P(n-Bu)3]2Cl2 (80 mg, 0.12 mmol) were dissolved in a mixed solvent of THF/Et2NH (1:1, v/v, 6 mL), and the flask was placed in a Dewar flask (ethyl acetate/liquid nitrogen low temperature bath). The flask was evacuated and back-filled with Ar. Then CuI (3.8 mg, 0.02 mmol) was added. The temperature of the mixture was allowed to rise from −78 °C to RT within 8 hours. Then deionized water was used to quench the reaction. The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (DCM, 3 × 15 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified using column chromatography (silica gel, CH2Cl2:petroleum ether = 1:2, v/v) to give compound Pt-a as a purple solid. Yield: 44.5 mg (45.3%).

The mixture was heated at 45 °C for 9 h. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was further purified using column chromatography (silica gel, CH2Cl2:petroleum ether = 1:1, v/v) to give Pt-b as a yellow solid. Yield: 36.9 mg (37.6%).

CuI (3.0 mg, 0.015 mmol) was added, and the mixture was stirred at 0–5 °C for 1 h. Deionized water was used to quench the reaction. The mixture was extracted with DCM (3 × 15 mL).

Complex Pt-2. 
Complex Pt-2 was prepared by a procedure similar to that for complex Pt-1, with Pt-b (29.0 mg, 0.03 mmol) as the starting material, instead of Pt-a. Complex Pt-2 was obtained as a dark green solid. Yield: 12.0 mg (33.3%). M.p.: 226.4–228.6 °C. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.49–7.48 (m, 3H), 7.36 (d, J = 10.0 Hz, 4H), 7.29–7.27 (m, 2H), 7.08 (d, J = 10.0 Hz, 4H), 5.97 (s, 4H), 2.64 (s, 6H), 2.55 (s, 12H), 2.13–2.08 (m, 24H), 1.61–1.55 (m, 24H), 1.45 (s, 12H), 1.43–1.37 (m, 30H), 0.89 (t, J = 10 Hz, 36H). 13C NMR (100 MHz): 159.1, 157.5, 145.8, 144.9, 142.2, 142.0, 137.8, 133.7, 133.3, 133.1, 132.3, 131.3, 131.1, 130.6, 123.3, 117.3, 117.1, 117.0, 113.3, 113.2, 113.1, 111.0, 102.0, 32.1, 28.7, 26.7, 26.6, 26.4, 26.3, 26.1, 16.7, 15.9, 15.4. MALDI-HRMS: calcd ([C113H161B3F6N6P4Pt2]+), m/z = 2263.1212, found, m/z = 2263.1409. Anal. calcd for [C113H161B3F6N6P4Pt2]: C, 59.95; H, 7.17; N, 3.71. Found: C, 60.05; H, 6.87; N, 3.87.


Crystal structure. 
The crystal was mounted on glass fibers for X-ray measurement. Reflection data were collected at room temperature on a Bruker AXS SMART APEX II CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromatized Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) and a ω scan mode. All the measured independent reflections (I > 2σ(I)) were used in the structural analyses, and semi-empirical absorption corrections were applied using the SADABS program. The structures were solved by the direct method using SHELXL-97. The hydrogen atoms of the organic frameworks were fixed at calculated positions geometrically and refined by using a riding model. In particular, the atoms (C22–C45) of the ligand are found to be disordered and modelled over two split positions with occupancies in a ratio of 0.3:0.7. All corresponding non-hydrogen atoms were refined by using the “Sadi” and “Simu” restraints to make the parameters of the disordered atoms more reasonable. A single crystal of Pt-b suitable for X-ray diffraction was grown by layering n-hexane onto the dichloromethane solution of the complex. The ORTEP drawing of Pt-b is depicted in Fig. 1. Selected atomic distances and bonding angles are summarized in Table 1.†

Nanosecond time-resolved transient difference absorption spectroscopy. 
Nanosecond time-resolved transient difference absorption spectra were recorded on a LP920 laser flash photolysis spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, Livingston, UK). The sample solution was purged with N2 or argon for 30 min before measurement. The samples were excited with a nanosecond pulsed laser (Vibrant 355II, wavelength tunable in the range of 410–2400 nm), and the transient signals were recorded on a Tektronix TDS 3012B oscilloscope.


Femtosecond ultrafast transient difference absorption spectroscopy. 
The ultrafast wavelength dependent pump probe spectroscopy measurements were performed using a Ti:sapphire laser amplifier-optical parametric amplifier system (Spectra Physics, Spitfire Pro XP, TOPAS) and a commercial setup (Spectra Physics, Helios). Pulse duration was measured to be 100 fs. Wavelengths of the pump beam were chosen according to the absorption spectra of complex Pt-2 as 500 nm (selective excitation into the peripheral Bodipy moiety) and 640 nm (selective excitation into the central coordinated Bodipy moiety). White light continuum was used as a probe beam.


TTA upconversion. 
A diode-pumped solid state continuous laser was used for upconversion (632 nm and 589 nm). The laser power was measured with a phototube. The mixed solution of the Pt(II) complex (triplet photosensitizers) and PBI (triplet acceptor) was degassed for at least 15 min with N2 or argon before measurement. The spectra were recorded on an adapted RF5301PC spectrofluorometer (Shimadzu, Japan).


The delayed fluorescence of the upconversion (τDF). 
The delayed fluorescence lifetimes (τDF) and spectra were recorded with an Opolette™ 355II + UV nanosecond pulsed laser (typical pulse length: 7 ns, pulse repetition: 20 Hz, peak OPO energy: 4 mJ, and wavelength is tunable in the range of 210–355 nm and 410–2200 nm. OPOTEK, USA), which is synchronized to a FLS 920 spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh, U.K.). The decay kinetics of the upconverted fluorescence (delayed fluorescence) was monitored with a FLS 920 spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh Instruments, Livingston, UK). The prompt fluorescence lifetime of the triplet acceptor perylene was measured with an EPL picosecond pulsed laser (405 nm) which is synchronized to the FLS 920 spectrofluorometer.

Results and discussion
Molecule design and synthesis
The principal molecular designing strategy of heteroleptic Pt-1 and Pt-2 is to use different Bodipy ligands showing different absorption wavelengths, in one Pt(II) complex molecule. Moreover, the energy acceptor acts as the spin converter,13b thus to convert the harvested excitation energy to the triplet state. Bodipy was selected as the visible light harvesting chromophore because of its strong absorption of visible light, high fluorescence quantum yields and easiness of derivatization.32–39 High fluorescence quantum yield indicates that the internal conversion is weak and it is more likely the ISC will be efficient if the Bodipy is attached to the Pt(II) centre. The Bodipy ligands in the complex molecule are with different coordination profiles, either at the 2-position of the π-core of Bodipy, or the 4′-position of the meso-phenyl group (Scheme 1). Thus the two coordination moieties give different absorption wavelengths.12,13
The central coordinated Bodipy units with 2,6-diethynyl presumably will show a longer absorption wavelength than the peripheral Bodipy ligands, which are metalated at the 2-position (Pt-1), or at the 4′-position of the meso-phenyl group of the Bodipy unit (Pt-2). Thus with spectral overlap, singlet energy transfer from the peripheral coordinated Bodipy ligands to the central coordinated Bodipy ligand is envisaged. With the central coordinated Bodipy moiety as the efficient spin converter to produce triplet excited states, effective broadband absorption was achieved for Pt-1 and Pt-2. The central coordinated Bodipy unit and the peripheral coordinated Bodipy at the 2-position (Pt-1) are expected to undergo efficient ISC because the metalation is directly on the π-core of the Bodipy chromophore.13
In Pt-2, the metalation of the peripheral Bodipy unit is on the meso-phenyl moiety, not on the π-core of the Bodipy. As a result, the UV-vis absorption of this ligand is not perturbed, i.e. it is at ca. 500 nm and the emission band overlaps with the absorption spectra of the central coordinated Bodipy unit. Thus singlet energy transfer from the peripheral Bodipy unit to the central Bodipy unit is expected. Complexes Pt-a and Pt-b were prepared as reference complexes. The previously reported Pt-3 was used as a reference for photophysical studies.
The preparation of the ligands is with Bodipy as the starting material (Scheme 2). Iodination and the Sonogashira coupling reactions readily introduce either mono- or bis-acetyl units at the 2- and 6-positions of the Bodipy chromophore. The Bodipy ligand with the ethynyl group at the meso-position was prepared with 4-bromobenzenaldehyde.
 Scheme 2  Preparation of the ligands and the Pt(II) complexes. The model complex Pt-3, triplet acceptor PBI used in TTA upconversion and the standards (B-6 and DCM) for determination of the fluorescence quantum yields are also presented. Reagents and conditions: (i) dry CH2Cl2, BF3·OEt2, NEt3; (ii) NIS, RT; (iii) trimethylsilylacetylene, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, PPh3, CuI, NEt3, reflux, 8 h; (iv) Bu4NF, THF, −78 °C; (v) K2CO3, MeOH, RT, 3 h; (vi) dry CH2Cl2, CF3COOH, BF3·OEt2, NEt3; (vii) distilled THF, NHEt2, CuI, −78 °C to RT, 8 h; (viii) NHEt2, 45 °C, 8 h; (ix) THF/HNEt2, CuI, 0–5 °C. 
Complexes Pt-a and Pt-b are the synthons for complexes Pt-1 and Pt-2 (Scheme 2). CuI catalyzed acetylization readily gives the desired complexes Pt-1 and Pt-2 with moderate to satisfactory yields. The reference complexes Pt-a and Pt-b were prepared by similar methods. All the complexes were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HR MS.
Single crystal molecular structures
The single crystal structure of complex Pt-b was determined (Fig. 1). The coordination geometry of the Pt(II) center is square planar with two PBu3 ligands, an ethynyl ligand and a Cl atom in a trans-arrangement.40 The meso-phenyl moiety takes a perpendicular geometry toward the π-core of the Bodipy chromophore. Thus there is no efficient π-conjugation across this phenyl group. This postulation was confirmed by the unchanged UV-vis absorption of the Bodipy unit upon coordination with the Pt(II) center in complex Pt-b. The C(21)–Pt(1) bond length is 1.965 Å. The P(1)–Pt(1) bond length is 2.318 Å. The CC bond length, C(21)–C(20), is 1.18 Å. All these bond lengths are similar to the reported linear Pt(II) complexes.41
Redox properties
The redox properties of the complexes were studied (Fig. 2). Complex Pt-a shows reversible oxidation wave at E1/2 = +0.62 V, and a reversible reduction wave at E1/2 = −1.52 V (Fig. 2a). The reversible reduction potential of Pt-b is at −1.51 V (Fig. 2b), which is similar to Pt-a. Irreversible oxidation wave at +0.91 V was observed for Pt-b. The energy gap of Pt-a is smaller than that of complex Pt-b. These differences can be attributed to the different linkage between the Pt(II) coordination centre and the Bodipy chromophore in complexes Pt-a and Pt-b.13 The cathodically shifted oxidation wave of complex Pt-a as compared with Pt-b may be due to the π-backbonding in Pt-a, for which the π-conjugation core of the Bodipy moiety is connected to the coordination centre.

The redox potentials of complex Pt-1 were studied (Fig. 2c). A reversible reduction wave was observed at E1/2 = −1.56 V. By comparison with the redox potential of Pt-3, the reduction wave at −1.56 V can be attributed to the sum of complexes Pt-a and Pt-1. A reversible oxidation wave at E1/2 = +0.43 V was observed. By comparison with Pt-3, this wave can be attributed to the central coordination Bodipy moiety. The oxidation wave of the peripherally coordinated Bodipy moiety in Pt-1 is at +0.70 V, which is anodically shifted as compared with that of complex Pt-a. This change can be attributed to the weaker π-backbonding in Pt-1 than in complex Pt-a. Similar results were observed for complex Pt-2 (Fig. 2d). Generally the redox potentials of the complexes Pt-1 and Pt-2 are the sum of the central coordinated Bodipy moiety and the respective peripheral coordinated Bodipy units (Table 2). Therefore, there is no strong electronic interaction, such as π-conjugation, between the chromophores in Pt-1 and Pt-2 at ground states. This conclusion is supported by the UV-vis absorption and the luminescence studies.

Steady-state electronic spectroscopy (UV-vis absorption and luminescence emission spectra)
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the complexes were studied (Fig. 3). Reference Pt-3 gives an absorption band centered at 643 nm, whereas complex Pt-a gives absorption at 584 nm (Fig. 3a). The effect of metalation of the π-core of Bodipy on the absorption is clear, that is, with metalation, the absorption of the Bodipy unit is red-shifted as compared with that of the free ligand.13 For Pt-1, the absorption band covers the range 450–700 nm, which is clearly much broader than the complexes with a single visible light-absorbing ligand, such as Pt-a and Pt-3. The absorption band at 643 nm of Pt-1 is attributed to the central coordinated ligand, as demonstrated by Pt-3. The minor absorption bands at 606 nm and 565 nm are attributed to the peripheral Bodipy ligands, as demonstrated by complex Pt-a.
 Fig. 3  UV-vis absorption spectra of the complexes. (a) Pt-a, Pt-1 and Pt-3. (b) Pt-b, Pt-2 and Pt-3. c = 1.0 × 10−5 M in toluene, 20 °C. 
No long range π-conjugation exists between the two difference Bodipy units across the Pt(II) centers in Pt-1. This postulation is supported by the same absorption band at 643 nm of Pt-3 as compared with the absorption band at 644 nm for Pt-1. This finding is different from the previously reported Pt(II) complexes,42 for which the absorption of one coordination ligand can be affected by the other coordination ligands in the molecule, demonstrated with the platinum–acetylide copolymers.43Pt-2 shows two well-separated absorption bands at 504 nm and 640 nm (Fig. 3b). By comparison of the shape and energy of the absorption bands with that of the references Pt-b and Pt-3, the two major absorption bands of Pt-2 can be assigned to the peripheral 4′-phenyl coordinated Bodipy unit and the central coordinated Bodipy unit, respectively.43 The absorption of Pt-2 is the sum of the reference compounds Pt-3 and Pt-b (Fig. 3b).
Therefore we propose that there is no significant electronic interaction between the two different coordination units in Pt-2. No S0 → T1 absorption bands were observed for the complexes.44 We found that the absorption bands of Pt-1 and Pt-2 are not broader than those of the complexes Pt-a and Pt-b, thus the numbers of the conformers of Pt-1 and Pt-2 in liquid solution are limited otherwise the broadening of the absorption bands should be observed.45
The UV-vis absorption maxima on the higher energy side of the absorption spectra of complexes Pt-1 and Pt-2 are identical to those of complexes Pt-a and Pt-b, respectively. Conversely, the absorption maxima on the lower energy side of the spectra are identical to that of complex Pt-3. Therefore, the Franck–Condon singlet excited states of the complexes are spatially confined to respective acetylide ligands, and there is no π-conjugation across the Pt(II) atom, otherwise red-shifted absorption bands will be observed for Pt-1 or Pt-2. This finding is different from the previously reported delocalized Franck–Condon singlet excited states in Pt(II) acetylide copolymers containing phenyl and thienyl acetylide ligands.43,45–47 Previously Pt(II) complexes with a Bodipy ligand were reported, but these complexes show ‘narrow’ absorption bands in the visible spectral region.48
The luminescence spectra of the complexes were studied (Fig. 4). Pt-a gives emission at 627 nm. The emission intensity is the same in both aerated and deaerated solutions. The luminescence lifetime of this emission band was determined to be 0.24 ns. These features and the small Stokes shift indicate that the luminescence is fluorescence. A minor emission band at 800 nm was observed and the emission intensity is reduced in aerated solution. Thus this emission band is most likely originated from a triplet emissive state, i.e. the emission band at 800 nm is phosphorescence. A similar emission feature was observed for Pt-1 (Fig. 4c). For complexes Pt-b and Pt-2 (Fig. 4b and d), only fluorescence emission bands were observed. The major emission band of both Pt-1 and Pt-2 is at 670 nm. In contrast, the emission of complexes Pt-a and Pt-b shows blue-shifting of 42 nm and 46 nm, respectively, as compared with that of Pt-1 and Pt-2, probably due to the different coordination profile of the Pt(II) centers.

Pt-1 shows a similar minor emission band at 825 nm, but Pt-2 does not show such emission. We propose that the emission band of Pt-1 at 825 nm is due to the peripheral coordination Bodipy ligand. Note that the energy gap between the S1 and T1 states of Pt-1 is 0.26 eV, much smaller than those of the linear Pt(ii) ethynylene complexes with simple organic acetylene ligands (ca. 0.7 eV).42 A small S1–T1 state energy gap is beneficial for fast ISC.42
In order to study the intramolecular singlet energy transfer, the luminescence of the complexes was compared (Fig. 5: the solutions are with the same optical density at the excitation wavelength). The emission of Pt-1 is, at 669 nm, different from that of Pt-a (Fig. 5a). Similarly, the emission of Pt-b at 516 nm was significantly quenched in Pt-2. Singlet energy transfer is the plausible reason for the quenching effect of the emission of Pt-a and Pt-b in the triads.
 Fig. 5  Emission of the complexes to demonstrate intramolecular singlet energy transfer. (a) Pt-a (c = 2.0 × 10−5 M), Pt-1 (c = 0.5 × 10−5 M) and Pt-3 (c = 1.0 × 10−5 M), λex = 424 nm. (b) Pt-b (c = 1.0 × 10−5 M), Pt-2 (c = 0.3 × 10−5 M) and Pt-3 (c = 1.0 × 10−5 M). λex = 490 nm. In (a) or (b), optically matched solutions at the excitation wavelength were used therefore the concentrations are different; in deaerated toluene, 20 °C. 
To evaluate the intramolecular energy transfer efficiency, the luminescence excitation spectra of the complexes were compared with the UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 6).27b Good superimposition between the excitation spectrum and the UV-vis absorption spectrum was observed, indicating an efficient RET effect in Pt-1. For Pt-2, two well-separated bands in the excitation spectrum were found. With normalization of the band at 640 nm, the excitation band at 502 nm is weaker than the corresponding UV-vis absorption band. The singlet energy transfer in Pt-2 from the peripheral Bodipy coordinated ligand to the central coordinated Bodipy part was calculated to be 44.8%.27b The inefficient intramolecular energy transfer can be attributed to the intramolecular electron transfer or inappropriate dipole moment orientation, the poor spectral overlap, etc.49,50 We noted the discrepancy between the results obtained by quenching studies and the excitation/absorption comparison, which is a lasting question in RET.27b The photophysical properties of the complexes are listed in Table 3. Pt-1, Pt-2 and Pt-a show weak fluorescence (ΦF < 5%), but complex Pt-b shows much stronger fluorescence (ΦF = 27.7%). The singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yields (ΦΔ) of the complexes were also measured (Table 3). The high values indicated efficient ISC in these complexes. Furthermore, the ΦΔ of Pt-2 is dependent on excitation wavelength, which is an indication of non-unity intramolecular electron transfer.

The fluorescence lifetimes of Pt-1 and Pt-2 were determined to be 0.48 ns and 0.66 ns, respectively. These values are very close to the fluorescence lifetime of the reference complex Pt-3 which contains only the central coordinated Bodipy ligand (0.49 ns).51 Therefore, we propose that there is no significant photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer, otherwise the fluorescence lifetimes will be reduced. This postulation is also supported by the similar triplet state lifetimes of Pt-1 and Pt-2 as compared to the reference complex Pt-3 (see the later section).52
Nanosecond time-resolved transient difference absorption spectroscopy: localization of the triplet excited state
In an effort to study the triplet excited state of the complexes, nanosecond time-resolved transient difference absorption spectra of the complexes were studied (Fig. 7). For Pt-a (Fig. 7a), a bleaching band at 566 nm was observed upon nanosecond pulsed laser excitation. This band is due to the depletion of the ground state of the Bodipy moiety upon photoexcitation. A minor bleaching band at 428 nm was also observed, which can be assigned to the ground state depletion of the same species. Transient absorption bands at 366 nm and 470 nm and a broadband in the region of 600–800 nm were observed. These features indicated that triplet excited state localized on the Bodipy part was populated. The decay curve gives the lifetime of 50.0 μs (at c = 1.0 × 10−5 M, Fig. 7b).
 Fig. 7  Nanosecond time-resolved transient difference absorption spectra and the decay curves of the Pt(II) complexes. (a) Complex Pt-a, (b) decay of Pt-a at 584 nm; (c) Pt-b, (d) decay of Pt-b at 504 nm (λex = 503 nm pulsed laser); (e) Pt-1, (f) decay curve of Pt-1 at 644 nm; (g) Pt-2, (h) decay curve of Pt-2 at 640 nm. With nanosecond pulsed laser excitation (λex = 532 nm). c = 1.0 × 10−5 M in deaerated toluene at 20 °C. 
For Pt-b, a bleaching band at 501 nm was observed (Fig. 7c), where the Bodipy moiety gives strong steady state absorption (Fig. 3b). Thus the triplet excited state of Pt-b is localized on the Bodipy ligand, not on the Pt(II) coordination center. The triplet state lifetime is up to 597.75 μs (c = 1.0 × 10−5 M). To the best of our knowledge, this is the longest RT triplet excited state lifetime observed for the Bodipy chromophore in transition metal complexes. Previously this value is normally shorter than 100 μs.30,53–58
The transient absorption spectra of Pt-1 show a bleaching band in the region of 550–700 nm (Fig. 7e), which is in agreement with the steady state absorption of Pt-1. The bleaching peak at 620 nm is stronger than that at 658 nm. Based on the steady state UV-vis absorption spectrum of Pt-1, we propose that the triplet excited state of Pt-1 is distributed on the three Bodipy ligands, and it is more localized on the peripheral coordinated Bodipy unit, than on the central coordinated Bodipy part. This apparent delocalization is most probably due to the degenerated T1 and T2 states of the complexes, i.e. triplet state equilibrium. This postulation is in agreement with the observation that the 810 nm phosphorescence band of complex Pt-a was not quenched in complex Pt-1. The triplet state lifetime of 63.13 μs was observed for Pt-1 (1.0 × 10−5 M). The uniform decay of the two triplet excited states indicated that the two isoenergetic triplet excited states are in fast equilibrium, i.e. there is efficient triplet state energy transfer between the different Bodipy ligands in the molecular chain.41 This conclusion is in agreement with the previous report of triplet excited state energy transfer across the central coordination Pt(II) center.43 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the excited state equilibrium was observed for the linear Pt(II) arylacetylide complexes.43 Previously, the T1 triplet excited state of the Pt(II) acetylide polymer or oligomers was reported to be spatially confined to one ligand.15 Although triplet state equilibrium was proposed previously, no direct spectral evidence was observed due to other competitive processes such as electron transfer (charge separation).52
The transient absorption of Pt-2 shows a major absorption band at 635 nm (Fig. 7g). Interestingly, no bleaching band at 501 nm was observed. Therefore, the triplet state of Pt-2 is exclusively confined to the central coordinated Bodipy ligand, not on the peripheral coordinated Bodipy ligand.43 Since we have shown with Pt-b that the triplet state of the peripheral coordinated Bodipy part can be produced upon pulsed laser excitation at 503 nm (Fig. 7c), the lack of the bleaching band at 500 nm of Pt-2 with pulsed laser excitation at 503 nm (see ESI, Fig. S18†) indicated intramolecular triplet–triplet-energy-transfer (TTET) from the peripheral Bodipy moiety to central Bodipy in Pt-2. No triplet state equilibrium was established in Pt-2 because of the large energy gap between the triplet states localized on the central and the peripheral Bodipy moieties. The triplet state energy level of the unsubstituted Bodipy was determined to be 1.70 eV by phosphorescence,53 whereas the central coordinated Bodipy moiety is with the triplet state energy level of 1.61 eV.30 The triplet state lifetime of Pt-2 was determined to be 94.18 μs (c = 1.0 × 10−5 M−1). The T1 state lifetime is very long, even with the Pt(II) center π-conjugatedly linked to the Bodipy chromophores,59 compared to platinum–phenyl acetylide oligomers (normally <25 μs).45 The observation of the long-lived triplet state with the complexes is unusual considering the low energy level of the coordinated Bodipy ligand (ca. 1.6 eV). Usually the triplet state lifetime will be short because the non-radiative decay will be significant with smaller T1–S0 energy gap.60 These long-living T1 states of the complexes are beneficial for the application of these complexes as the triplet state energy donor to initiate the cascade photophysical processes.59
Linear Pt(II) acetylide complexes showing a long-lived T1 state were rarely reported.17 Previously Pt(II) acetylide complexes with fluorenyl ligands were reported to show the T1 state lifetime up to 178–220 μs, but those complexes show weak absorption of visible light.47 Notably the long-living triplet state of Pt-1 and Pt-2 is not compromised by any low triplet state yield indicated by the high singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yields (ΦΔ, Table 3).44 A similar triplet state lifetime of the complexes Pt-1, Pt-2, and Pt-a and the reference complex Pt-3 (64.3 μs)51 indicated that there is no significant photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer for Pt-1 and Pt-2, otherwise the triplet state lifetimes will be substantially reduced.52 Furthermore, all the transient absorption features (T1 → Tn transitions) are similar to that observed for the Pt(II) Bodipy acetylide complex, thus the compelling evidence shows that the transient species are due to the triplet excited state of the coordinated Bodipy ligands, not charge separated states.52
Calculation of the free energy changes of the photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer
The study of the triplet excited state implies that no significant electron transfer exists for complexes Pt-1 and Pt-2, because the triplet state lifetimes of Pt-1 and Pt-2 are close to those of complexes Pt-a and Pt-3. This conclusion was supported by calculation of the free energy changes (ΔG°CS) of the photo-induced intramolecular electron transfer with the Weller equation.
First, we assume that the triplet excited state of Pt-1 and Pt-2 is responsible to initiate the photo-induced intramolecular electron transfer. Based on the electrochemical properties of the complexes (Table 2), the central coordinated Bodipy moiety was considered as the electron donor (EOX1/2 = +0.43 V), and the peripheral coordinated Bodipy as the electron acceptor (ERED1/2 = −1.56 V). The E0,0 value was approximated by the phosphorescence of Pt-1 (ca. 1.55 eV). Therefore the free energy change of electron transfer of Pt-1 was approximated as ΔG°CS = e[EOX − ERED] − E0,0 = 0.43 − (−1.56) − 1.55 = +0.44 eV (the static Columbic energy is usually small and was not considered here). Thus, the triplet excited state of Pt-1 is unlikely to drive intramolecular electron transfer. Similarly a positive value of +0.45 eV was determined for Pt-2. If the singlet excited state of Pt-1 and Pt-2 was responsible to drive intramolecular electron transfer (E0,0 is approximated with the fluorescence emission wavelength as ca. 1.85 eV), ΔG°CS = +0.14 eV and ΔG°CS = +0.15 eV were obtained for Pt-1 and Pt-2, respectively. Thus, no photo-induced electron transfer is expected for Pt-1 and Pt-2.
Femtosecond time-resolved transient difference absorption spectroscopy: singlet energy transfer
The two kinds of Bodipy ligand in Pt-2 show substantially different absorption wavelengths (Fig. 3b), thus Pt-2 is ideal for the study of the ultrafast singlet energy transfer. Femtosecond ultrafast pump–probe experiments were performed for Pt-2 at 504 nm and 640 nm pump wavelength to excite the singlet state of the peripheral BODIPY part and central coordinated BODIPY part, respectively (S0 → S1) (Fig. 8). Upon excitation of Pt-2 at 504 nm, bleaching bands were observed around 505 nm and 650 nm where the peripheral BODIPY part and central coordinated BODIPY part give the steady state absorption, respectively. While the bleaching signal around 505 nm decreases, the bleaching signal around 650 nm increases concomitantly (Fig. 8). The decay time of the bleaching signal of the peripheral Bodipy part (around 505 nm) is about 25 ps, which is approximately equal to the rise time of the bleaching signal of the central coordinated Bodipy part (around 650 nm, Fig. 8b). This process indicates singlet energy transfer from the peripheral Bodipy part to central coordinated Bodipy part (kEnT = 4.0 × 1010 s−1). On the other hand, a positive signal (excited state absorption) appears above 680 nm probe wavelength after 800 ps delay time (independent of the pump wavelength). This signal can be attributed to the T1–Tn transition.
 Fig. 8  Picosecond ultrafast transient absorption spectra of Pt-2 upon femtosecond pulsed laser excitation at 504 nm. (a) Transient absorption spectra after pulsed laser excitation at 504 nm. (b) Decay traces at 500 nm and 650 nm. c = 1.0 × 10−5 M in toluene at 20 °C. 
In addition, an extra pump probe experiment was performed with 640 nm pump wavelength (see ESI, Fig. S19†). There is a single bleaching signal at 650 nm, which corresponds to the singlet state of the central coordinated BODIPY part and no singlet energy transfer is expected. Furthermore, a similar T1–Tn transition was observed as a positive signal at the same wavelength (680 nm).
DFT calculations on the photophysical properties of the complexes
The spin density surfaces of the complexes were calculated (Fig. 9). For Pt-a and Pt-b, the spin density is localized on the Bodipy unit, not on the Pt(II) coordination centre. This result is in agreement with the transient absorption spectra (Fig. 7). For Pt-1, the spin density surface is localized on the peripheral coordinated Bodipy part. Since the spin density surface shows the location of only the T1 state, this result is in agreement with the nanosecond time-resolved transient difference absorption, which indicates that the triplet state is more localized on the peripheral Bodipy moiety (Fig. 7), as well as the fact that the phosphorescence of the peripheral coordinated Bodipy (Pt-a) is retained in Pt-1 (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 9  Isosurfaces of spin density of the complexes Pt-a, Pt-b, Pt-1 and Pt-2. Calculated at the optimized triplet state geometries. Toluene was used as a solvent in the calculations (PCM model). Calculation was performed at the B3LYP/GENECP/LANL2DZ level with Gaussian 09W. 
For Pt-2, the spin density is exclusively localized on the central coordinated Bodipy ligand, and the peripheral coordinated Bodipy ligand does not contribute to the spin density surface at all. This finding is in full agreement with the transient absorption spectrum (Fig. 7g). Based on the spin density surface, the T1 state of Pt-2 is highly confined to the central Bodipy ligand (Fig. 9).46
For Pt-1 and Pt-2, the common feature of the spin density surface is the minor contribution of the Pt(II) atom. With the large π-conjugation ligand, the S1 and T1 states are more localized on the ligand, therefore the 3IL → S0 transition is assumed to be a strongly forbidden transition, which may be responsible for the long lifetime of the T1 state of the complexes.44
The electronic structures of the singlet excited states and the triplet excited states of the complexes Pt-1 and Pt-2 were studied in detail by DFT and TDDFT methods. HOMO → LUMO+1 is involved in the S0 → S1 transition of Pt-1 (Fig. 10), thus the S1 state is featured with a charge transfer character. The S3 state is localized on the central coordinated Bodipy unit. The S18 state is mainly localized on the peripheral Bodipy ligands.

The triplet state of Pt-1 was studied by the TDDFT method based on the ground state geometry (Table 4). HOMO → LUMO+2 is involved in the T1 state, thus the T1 state is localized on the central coordinated Bodipy unit to a large extent. HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 are involved in the T2 state. Thus the T2 state is localized on the peripheral Bodipy unit.

The electronic structure of the singlet excited state and the triplet excited state of B-2 was also studied by the DFT and the TDDFT calculations (Fig. 11 and Table 5). The S0 → S1 transition is composed of HOMO → LUMO, both orbitals are localized on the central coordination Bodipy unit. We found degenerated S2 and S3 states (Table 5), for which HOMO−3 → LUMO+1 and HOMO−2 → LUMO+1 are involved, respectively. S2 and S3 states are localized on the peripheral coordinated Bodipy units (Fig. 11). We noted the discrepancy between the calculated excitation energy (UV-vis absorption) and the experimental values. This result is within expectation because it is known that the DFT theory usually overestimated the excitation energy of Bodipy compounds.61

The triplet states of Pt-2 were studied by similar methods based on the ground state geometry (Fig. 11 and Table 5). HOMO and LUMO are involved in the T1 state (Table 5). Thus it is clear that the T1 state is localized on the central coordinated Bodipy unit. This conclusion is in agreement with the nanosecond time-resolved transient difference absorption spectra of Pt-2 (Fig. 7). Degenerated T2 and T3 states were observed for Pt-2 (energy level is 1.39 eV). Inspection of the MOs involved in T2 and T3 states indicates that these triplet states are localized on the peripheral coordinated Bodipy units.
The photophysical process of Pt-1 and Pt-2 are summarized in Scheme 3. For Pt-1, the UV-vis absorption spectrum indicated that the peripheral coordinated Bodipy part shows higher singlet state energy (1[BDP*-p] in Scheme 3) than the central coordinated Bodipy part (1[BDP*-c] in Scheme 3). The luminescence emission studies show that the fluorescence of the 1[BDP*-p] part was quenched in Pt-1, i.e. the singlet excited state of the peripheral coordinated Bodipy is with a slightly higher energy level than the central coordinated Bodipy moiety does, thus the singlet energy transfer from the 1[BDP*-p] to 1[BDP*-c] takes place. As a result, only the fluorescence emission from the 1[BDP*-c] part can be observed. Both coordination parts can undergo ISC to give the triplet excited state. The two triplet excited states localized on the central and the peripheral Bodipy parts are in fast equilibrium, since the two triplet excited states decay uniformly (Fig. 7e). Triplet excited state equilibrium in transition metal complexes was rarely reported.62
 Scheme 3  Qualitative energy level diagram of complexes (a) Pt-1 and (b) Pt-2. BDP stands for Bodipy. BDP-c stands for the central coordination Bodipy part. BDP-p stands for the peripheral coordination Bodipy part. 
For Pt-2, the difference between the S1 state energy levels of the peripheral and the central Bodipy parts is more distinct than that of Pt-1. Based on the transient absorption spectra, no triplet state equilibrium was observed for Pt-2. Thus we propose that the 3[BDP*-p] state was quenched by the efficient triplet state energy transfer to 3[BDP*-c]. This photophysical process is different from that of Pt-1.
Triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion with the complexes as triplet photosensitizers
The complexes show strong absorption of visible light and long-lived triplet excited states, thus these complexes can be used as triplet photosensitizers for TTA upconversion.13,63 Among the upconversion methods, TTA upconversion is of particular interest, due to its strong absorption of visible light, high upconversion quantum yields, and tunable excitation/emission wavelength. Non-coherent, low power excitation light is sufficient for this kind of upconversion, such as solar light.64–68 Conventional triplet photosensitizers for TTA upconversion are limited to Pt(II) or Pd(II) porphyrin complexes.64,65,69,70 Recently we developed a series of Ru(II), Pt(II), Ir(III) and Re(I) complexes for TTA upconversion; all these complexes show strong absorption of visible light and long-lived triplet excited states.13,65 However, to the best of our knowledge, no complexes showing broadband visible light absorption have been used as a triplet photosensitizer for TTA upconversion. It will become possible to carry out multi-wavelength excitable upconversion with the complexes Pt-1 and Pt-2, which may be suitable for TTA upconversion with a broadband excitation source.
First a 635 nm laser was used for excitation. All the complexes Pt-1–Pt-3 give strong fluorescence at 670 nm (Fig. 12a). In the presence of a triplet energy acceptor PBI, emission bands in the region of 510–600 nm were observed (Fig. 12b). Excitation of PBI alone with a 635 nm laser did not produce any emission bands in the same region. Thus, these new emission bands can be attributed to the upconverted emission of PBI. Upconversion quantum yields of 1.53%, 1.19% and 2.42% were determined for Pt-1–Pt-3, respectively.
 Fig. 12  Upconversion with Pt-1, Pt-2 and Pt-3 as the triplet photosensitizers and PBI as a triplet acceptor. (a) Photoluminescence spectra of the photosensitizers alone at 635 nm excitation (10 mW). (b) Photoluminescence spectra in the presence of PBI. Excited with a 635 nm laser (10 mW). (c) Photoluminescence spectra of the photosensitizers alone at 589 nm excitation (5 mW). (d) Photoluminescence spectra of the complexes in the presence of PBI. Excited with a 589 nm laser (5 mW). For Pt-1, c [PBI] = 2.6 × 10−5 M; for Pt-2, c [PBI] = 4.0 × 10−5 M; for Pt-3, c [PBI] = 4.1 × 10−5 M. The asterisks indicate the scattered laser (589 nm and 635 nm). c [photosensitizers] = 1.0 × 10−5 M in deaerated toluene at 20 °C. 
Since these complexes show broadband absorption in the region of 500–700 nm, we also used another excitation wavelength (589 nm) for the TTA upconversion (Fig. 12c and d). Interestingly, we found that the TTA upconversion is stronger as compared with that excited at 635 nm. For example, the upconverted emission intensity in the region of 500–600 nm is stronger than the residual fluorescence of the complexes, which can be treated as an internal standard. The upconversion quantum yields were determined to be 9.72%, 4.89% and 9.84% for Pt-1–Pt-3, respectively with excitation at 589 nm.
The upconversion can be performed in dim light, for example, the light from a spectrofluorometer (see ESI, Fig. S20†). TTA upconversion was observed with Pt-1 and Pt-2 by excitation at 600–620 nm with a spectrofluorometer. Other upconversion methods failed to be carried out with weak light as an excitation source.71
The TTA upconversion with the complexes as triplet photosensitizers is visible to the naked eye (Fig. 13). For the complexes alone, deep red emission was observed upon 635 nm laser excitation. In the presence of a triplet acceptor/emitter PBI, strong green emission was observed. Such strong and un-aided eye-visible upconversion will be promising for applications in luminescence bioimaging72–75 or solar cells.76–78
 Fig. 13  Photographs of the TTA upconversion. Emission of triplet photosensitizers alone and the TTA upconversion. Excited with a continuous 635 nm laser (10 mW). c [complexes] = 1.0 × 10−5 M. For Pt-1, c [PBI] = 2.6 × 10−5 M; for Pt-2, c [PBI] = 4.0 × 10−5 M in deaerated toluene at 20 °C. 
The delayed fluorescence of the TTA upconversion was studied (Fig. 14). Firstly, we studied the fluorescence emission of Pt-1 alone. Interestingly, we observed long-lived luminescence (τDF = 43.8 μs). The emission features, such as the wavelength and the band shape, are superimposable to the steady state luminescence spectrum of Pt-1. The emission of Pt-1 was also studied in aerated solution, and no signal was observed. Considering that the power of a nanosecond pulsed OPO laser is high, and the long-lived triplet state of Pt-1, we propose that the long-lived luminescence is due to the delayed fluorescence, via the TTA mechanism. This postulation was supported by the fact that no such long-lived fluorescence can be observed with the picosecond pulsed laser, for which the laser power is much lower. Thus, another mechanism for the delayed fluorescence, i.e. the thermally activated reverse ISC, is not responsible for the delayed luminescence of Pt-1.79,80

(a) Pt-1 alone, the fluorescence and phosphorescence regions were measured (550–850 nm, τDF = 43.8 ms, τP = 47.6 ms). (b) TRES of Pt-1 in the presence of PBI. Upconverted emission in the range of 500–600 nm was observed (τDF = 130.5 μs). (c) TRES of Pt-2 alone. The fluorescence region was measured (550–850 nm, τDF = 111.0 μs). (d) TRES of Pt-2 in the presence of PBI. Upconverted emission in the range of 500–600 nm was observed (τ = 43.5 μs). For Pt-1, c [PBI] = 4.0 × 10−5 M, for Pt-2, c [PBI] = 4.0 × 10−5 M. c [sensitizers] = 1.0 × 10−5 M in deaerated toluene. Excited with a nanosecond pulsed OPO laser synchronized with a spectrofluorometer (λex = 560 nm), 25 °C. 
Similar delayed luminescence was observed for Pt-2 (τDF = 111.0 μs, in aerated solution, no signal was detected). Delayed luminescence was observed for Pt-a (13.7 μs) and Pt-b (189.2 μs). The delayed fluorescence of the complexes is due to the long-lived triplet excited states. To the best of our knowledge, the delayed fluorescence of Pt(II) complexes is rarely reported.17,81–84 Previously it was observed for Pt-3.51 Delayed fluorescence may find applications in time-gated luminescence bioimaging.85
In the presence of triplet energy acceptor PBI, fluorescence emission in the region of 500–600 nm was observed (Fig. 14b and d), which is the featured fluorescence of PBI. The luminescence lifetime was determined to be 130.5 μs and 43.5 μs with Pt-1 and Pt-2 as the triplet photosensitizers, respectively. Thus the TTA upconversion was confirmed by the delayed fluorescence of PBI.69
Conclusions
In summary, two heteroleptic trans-bis(alkylphosphine) platinum(II)-alkynyl complexes with three Bodipy ligands were prepared to achieve the goal of broadband absorption of visible light (Pt-1 and Pt-2). Sequential intramolecular resonance energy transfer (RET) and intersystem crossing (ISC) were concerted to transform the harvested broadband photoexcitation energy to triplet excited state energy. Both the singlet energy donor and the acceptor give strong visible light absorption, but at different wavelengths. The singlet energy acceptor is also a spin converter to produce triplet excited states. Two reference complexes with only one visible light-absorbing Bodipy ligand in the molecule were prepared for comparison. Singlet energy transfer from the peripheral coordination Bodipy moiety to the central coordinated Bodipy (with 2,6-diacetyl profile) moiety was confirmed by steady state luminescence spectroscopy, fluorescence excitation spectroscopy and femtosecond ultrafast transient difference absorption spectroscopy. Nanosecond time-resolved transient difference absorption spectroscopy indicated that the triplet excited state of Pt-1 is delocalized on both the peripheral and the central coordinated Bodipy units. For Pt-2, however, the T1 state is confined to the central coordinated Bodipy segment. Long-lived triplet excited states were observed for both complexes (τT = 63.13 μs for Pt-1 and τT = 94.18 μs for Pt-2 at 1.0 × 10−5 M). With pulsed laser excitation, delayed fluorescence was observed for the complexes (τDF = 43.8 μs for Pt-1, τDF = 111.0 μs for Pt-2), which is rarely reported for transition metal complexes. The complexes were used for multi-wavelength excitable triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion. Furthermore, the efficient singlet and triplet energy transfer for the chromophores across the center coordinating Pt(II) center will be fundamentally important for investigation of the photochemistry of Pt(II) complexes and for construction of functional molecular arrays with these photoresponsive units. Our results are useful for preparation of transition metal complexes that show broadband absorption of visible light and long-lived triplet excited states, for the study of the fundamental photochemical properties of transition metal complexes and the applications in photocatalysis, luminescence bioimaging photodynamic therapy and upconversion.
