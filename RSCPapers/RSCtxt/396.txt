    , Accepted 27th October 2020First published on 28th October 2020AbstractDespite the high quantum efficiency of solar energy conversion by photosynthesis, practical development of photosynthetic solar energy has been limited so far. One of the main challenges is the relatively poor absorption of photons by photosystems due to narrow absorption spectra, reflection, and respiration. Although most studies focused on increasing the harvesting of photosynthetic electrons (PEs), engineering photon absorption in photosynthesis is another important pathway to pursue for enhancement of photosynthetic solar energy harvesting. Here, plasmonic resonance energy transfer (PRET) from plasmonic nanoparticles to thylakoid membranes (TMs) is proposed to stimulate photosynthesis and increase production of PEs. Gold nanorods (AuNRs), which have a plasmon resonance peak close to 680 nm, are selected to increase the production of high energy PEs by PRET. With AuNR conjugation to spinach TMs, light-triggered PE currents increase to the magnitude 4 fold larger than the currents without the plasmonic AuNRs. Biophotovoltaic (BPV) cells were prepared with the plasmon-enhanced spinach TMs, and they were connected in series and with a capacitor for charge accumulation. The spinach BPVs were charged to achieve high OCP enough to power an LED lamp, demonstrating the feasibility to operate low-power electronics.
Introduction
A biophotovoltaic (BPV) cell is an electrochemical system which converts incident solar energy to electrical energy using biological materials. Commonly, photosynthetic cells, bacteria, and organelles are utilized as energy resources in BPV cells because they can produce high energy photosynthetic electrons (PEs) using absorbed light energy during photosynthesis. A number of approaches to extract PEs in a form of electric currents from photosynthesis have been investigated using whole photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria1–5 and living algae6–10 or subcellular photosynthetic apparatuses such as chloroplasts,11 thylakoid membranes (TMs),12–18 photosystem II (PS II)19–23 or photosystem I (PS I).24–26 Cyanobacteria are widely employed in microbial fuel cells because PEs generated inside cyanobacteria can be transported to the outside of the membrane with relative easiness compared to other photosynthetic cells.27,28 However, the need for cultivation and difficulty in controlled cultivation hamper their further development into practical applications. Otherwise, living algal cells can be utilized as is in nature, however, a high aspect-ratio nanoscale electrode should be developed to penetrate the cell membrane without rupture to extract PEs.7 Although both these whole photosynthetic organisms have their advantages in long term sustainability, such living cell-based systems are limited in their scalability and controlled operation due to the continuous cell proliferation. On the other hand, subcellular apparatuses, which are isolated and purified from the cell fragments, can be processed into devices in a form of coating on an electron collector or a mixture with an electrically conducting material. Therefore, various attempts have been made to construct electron conduction pathways based on electron mediators,4,29 conductive nanowire percolations20,30 or conductive nanosheet percolations31,32 or by modifying an electrode surface physically/chemically with carbon nanotubes,33,34 redox-polymers,11,35 and tethering molecules22,36 or by enlarging the surface area.37–39
Plasmon resonance energy transfer (PRET) can further advance the performance of a photosynthetic BPV cell by plasmonic stimulation of photon absorption by PS II or PS I. Since induction of plasmon effects near PS II or PS I can dramatically increase photon absorption by the photosynthetic apparatus, introduction of PRET can help overcome limited photon absorption by photosystems, a major obstacle in BPV technology.40 The possibility of plasmon-enhanced energy transfer to photosystems has been studied by optical measurements,41–44 numerical simulations45,46 or photodiode enhancements.47–49 Recently, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the UV-blue fluorophore to TMs was reported and showed the feasibility of enhanced photon absorption by resonance energy transfer.50
In this study, we propose a plasmon-induced photosynthetic anode where plasmonic gold nanorods (AuNRs) are conjugated to TMs to increase photon absorption (Fig. 1). AuNRs were selected as plasmonic nanomaterials which have plasmon resonance near 680 nm. Since P680 of PS II uses 680 nm to excite PEs, plasmonic energy can be transferred not only to light harvesting complexes (LHC) but also to P680 to generate larger quantities of high energy PEs. Since the degree of plasmon enhancement is inversely proportional to the 6th power of distance, a short tethering molecule was utilized to conjugate AuNRs to PS II. We demonstrated the influence of PRET from AuNRs on TMs by comparing PE currents from both gold nanorod–thylakoid membrane conjugates (Au–TM) and pure TMs. Noticeably, PE currents in the presence of the conjugates increased 4.2 times compared to PE currents from pure TMs without the conjugates. We configured an array of serially connected BPV cells with the Au–TM anode and a Pt on carbon (Pt/C) cathode in combination with a charge accumulation circuit. The charging and discharging characteristics of the BPV cell array were analyzed under different anode conditions. The BPV cell array produced an output potential above 2.0 V and powered an LED, demonstrating the possibility to operate low-power electronics only with spinach extracts.

Results
Conjugation process of AuNRs with TMs
Maintaining a close distance between AuNRs and TMs was achieved by forming conjugation of AuNRs and TMs using a heterogeneous bi-functional polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule, HS–PEG–NHS ester (Fig. 2a). The conjugation proceeded through 3 steps (Fig. 2b). First, AuNRs with peak plasmon resonance wavelength at 675 nm (close to the photosynthetic absorption wavelength of 680 nm), were prepared as an aqueous solution. Then, the HS–PEG–NHS ester tethering molecule, which has four PEGs as a spacer, an –SH (thiol) group at one end and a succinimidyl (NHS) ester at the other end, was added to the AuNR solution. Since AuNRs were suspended in distilled water where pH was 6.5, the thiol groups were easily attached on the surface of AuNRs. Use of distilled water prevented AuNRs from being aggregated, while a highly ionic suspension could trigger nanoparticle aggregation.51 Nanoparticle aggregates formed are likely to red-shift and broaden their plasmon resonance spectra (Fig. S1†). Finally, the TM suspension in PBS was mixed with AuNR–PEG–NHS ester conjugates. To maintain optimum environments for NHS ester to react with the amine groups of TMs, the TM suspension was concentrated to have ×2 PBS. The final suspension of Au–TM had ×1 PBS at pH of 7.4, and NHS ester formed chemical bonds with TMs. The final solution had 174 μg mL−1 of AuNRs, 38 mM HS–PEG–NHS ester, and 0.1 mg Chl per mL of TMs.

Each sample through the conjugation steps was pictured using a SEM or TEM to observe its geometry and morphology after attaching the tethering molecules or TMs (Fig. 2c–f). Pure AuNRs in distilled water showed their rod shape with an average width of 17 nm and length of 45 nm with a clean interface between the surface and suspension as shown in the TEM images of Fig. 2c and d. After coating the HS–PEG–NHS molecules on the AuNR surface, coated tethering molecules appeared as jiggling coronae around each AuNR surface (Fig. 2e). The thickness of the corona was measured as 3 to 4 nm which was matched with the length of tethering molecules. The final solution, AuNR–TM conjugates, was observed using a SEM since a single thylakoid vesicle had a diameter of 300 nm, which was bigger than the size of AuNRs. As shown in Fig. 2f, AuNRs were well dispersed and attached on the surface of TMs after mixing TMs with the AuNR–PEG–NHS solution.
Characterization of HS–PEG–NHS ester on AuNR–TM conjugation
Thiol groups are well known to have excellent affinity with gold, and therefore, HS–PEG–NHS attached on any Au surface would be detected using a spectral method such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 3, S2†). Similar to the result of the tethering molecule on the Au film which is explained in the ESI (Fig. S2a–e),† pure AuNRs and AuNR–PEG–NHS ester samples were cast on a substrate and dried to be analyzed using XPS (Fig. 3a). In Fig. 3b, the Au peak was clearly noticeable in the XPS spectrum of the pure AuNRs. On the other hand, in the case of AuNR–PEG–NHS ester samples, they have –NHS ester exposed at the outside of the AuNR–PEG–NHS esters instead of Au, and their XPS results showed C, O, and a small fraction of N (Fig. 3c–e). Furthermore, since pure AuNR and AuNR–PEG–NHS ester had different surface compositions, they were distinguishable by measuring the zeta potential. Pure AuNRs had a larger negative zeta potential of −64 mV, while AuNR–PEG–NHS ester had a relatively positive zeta potential, which was −19 mV.

The morphology of Au–TM was analyzed using SEM images (Fig. 4). Typically, a single vesicle of the pure TM had a disk shape with 300 nm diameter (Fig. 4a). To confirm the assembly between AuNRs and TMs and the influence of tethering molecules as shown in Fig. 4b and c, TMs prepared without and with the tethering molecule, HS–PEG–NHS ester, were imaged. Without the HS–PEG–NHS ester, AuNRs were randomly deployed on TM surfaces and the substrate (Fig. 4d). However, when the tethering molecule was applied to attach AuNRs to TMs, a much larger number of AuNRs were dispersed on the surface of TMs (Fig. 4e). Based on each SEM image which showed 5 μm2 area, it was estimated that 2094 AuNRs were attached on the TM in the case of using the tethering molecule, while only 460 AuNRs were observed in the same size of area without tethering molecules. Considering the density of the bulk AuNR solution and the dilution factor, theoretically 360 AuNRs were supposed to exist in 5 μm2 area (Fig. 4f). This matches properly with the results of AuNR deployment without the tethering molecules. Therefore, the tethering molecule, HS–PEG–NHS ester, dramatically improved linkages between AuNRs and TMs.

Theoretical value was calculated based on the density of the bulk AuNR solution and the dilution factor. 
Plasmon-enhanced PE current and electrochemical characterization
With firm AuNR attachment on TMs, the distance between AuNRs and the TM was likely to be maintained within a few nanometers (the length of HS–PEG–NHS ester). This short distance facilitates plasmon-induced energy transfer from AuNRs to the PS II and PS I of TMs, leading to increased photon energy absorption. To understand how such plasmon-stimulated photosynthesis influences the magnitude of PE currents, a conventional three-electrode system was prepared (Fig. 5a). A gold electrode was used as a working electrode where the TM or Au–TM was dispersed. A Pt mesh and an Ag/AgCl electrode were employed as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. To measure PE currents, the chronoamperometric (CA) method was utilized. 0.5 V of bias potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) was applied to the working electrode where the pure TM or Au–TM was dispersed. Light was illuminated on the TM-deposited electrode at the intensity of 10 mW cm−2 using a halogen lamp and light-triggered PE currents were measured using a potentiostat (Fig. 5b). The PE currents from Au–TM were measured as 437.1 nA cm−2, whereas the PE currents from pure TMs were measured as 98.4 nA cm−2.

(f) Nyquist plot comparison with bare Au, pure TM, and Au–TM with and without light illumination. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses were conducted to electrochemically characterize Au–TM anodes. To monitor the influence of TMs or AuNRs on the circuit impedance of the measurement system, Bode and Nyquist plots were analyzed and compared for a bare electrode, pure TM, pure AuNRs and Au–TM. In a phase diagram, no noticeable phase change was observed in all cases compared to the bare Au electrode, which means that the dispersion of TMs, AuNRs or Au–TM negligibly affected the capacitance of the overall system (Fig. 5c). On the other hand, overall resistance decreased when TMs or Au–TM was applied (Fig. 5d and e). In the system, electron flux increased as TMs generate PEs by photosynthesis, and therefore, the decrease of resistance from 93.78 Ω to 80.11 Ω indicated PE flux from TMs. Moreover, resistance further decreased to 66.61 Ω in the case of Au–TM, and this supported the statement that more PEs were generated from Au–TM compared to pure TMs (Table S1†). Changes in resistance values were also observed under light illumination and compared among Au–TM, pure TM, and the bare Au electrode (Fig. 5f). Since incident light was not able to generate any light-induced current or electrons from the bare electrode, the Nyquist plot of the bare electrode stayed identical (130.9 Ω and 126.7 Ω, respectively). On the other hand, resistance decreased from 95.55 Ω to 80.56 Ω in the case of the TM-deposited electrode under illumination, and this indicates the contribution of PE flux by photosynthesis (Table S2†).
Experimental analyses of plasmon-enhanced PE currents
To confirm the AuNR-induced PRET, the wavelength dependency of plasmon-enhanced photosynthesis was investigated (Fig. 6a–c). The photosystems of plants mainly utilize photons with the wavelengths of either 680 nm for PS II or 700 nm for PS I to generate high energy PEs. Since the AuNRs used in this work have plasmon resonance wavelength at around 675 nm, a plasmon field was generated at the wavelengths of around 675 nm, which is close to the absorption wavelengths for either PS II or PS I. The Au–TM was illuminated with three different light sources: white, red, and blue lights. Under the white light illumination, plasmon enhancement was evident between Au–TM and pure TM samples (Fig. 6a). Switching to red illumination produced plasmonic enhancement similar to the white illumination due to the coincidence between illumination and AuNRs (Fig. 6b). However, the degree of PE current was reduced compared to the case of white illumination. This reduction in PE current was ascribed to the reduced contribution of photons with wavelengths shorter than red light to photosynthesis. The white light contains photons with shorter wavelengths which contributed to PE current generation but not to plasmon enhancement (e.g. near 450 nm range). As shown in Fig. 6c, use of blue illumination resulted in no PE current difference between Au–TM and pure TM samples. This indicates that no plasmonic resonance occurred in the Au–TM samples, since the wavelength of the absorbed photons did not match with the plasmon resonance wavelength of the AuNRs.

PE currents measured under (a) white, (b) red, and (c) near-UV illumination. (d) PE currents depend on different combinations of each component in Au–TM (AuNR, tethering molecules and TMs) and DCMU-treated TMs and Au–TM. (e) Actual measured PE currents which were plotted in (d). A spike at 90 s occurred by unexpected external noise. 
To confirm whether the enhancement originated from the AuNR-based plasmon energy transfer, PE currents were measured from different combinations of the components used in the conjugation (Fig. 6d and e). First, PE currents were measured from main components such as TMs, AuNRs, and the tethering molecule, HS–PEG–NHS. Starting from the PE current of Au–TM, enhanced PE currents were only observed from Au–TM samples. The magnitudes of PE currents from pure AuNRs, tethering molecules or AuNR–PEG–NHS ester were negligible. This confirmed that either AuNR itself, the tethering molecule or AuNR–PEG–NHS ester does not generate any light-triggered electrical current. The effect of bi-products or intermediate products of Au–TM including TMs was also investigated in the same manner. Probable bi-products or intermediate products such as HS–PEG–TM and a simple mixture of TMs and AuNRs were exposed to light illumination, and they did not show any PE current enhancement, either. Since simple physical mixing of AuNRs and TMs could place AuNRs on the surface of TMs and transfer plasmon energy, the PE currents were slightly higher than the PE currents from pure TM samples. However, the difference was statistically insignificant since physical mixing of AuNRs and TMs was less likely to place AuNRs close enough to the TMs within the effective range of PRET.
Moreover, because attached AuNRs performed as the plasmon energy sources, PE current variation depending on the density of AuNRs was investigated (Fig. S3†). By varying the amount of AuNRs while other materials were maintained identical, the PE current of each sample was measured and compared. Starting with 174 μg mL−1 of AuNRs, the PE current density was measured as 155.3 nA cm−2 which was 10.2 fold larger compared to the PE current density of the pure TM (15.2 nA cm−2). For 52.2 μg mL−1 of AuNRs, PE current decreased to 101.4 nA cm−2. Moreover, as the AuNR density decreased to 17.4, 5.22, and 1.74 μg mL−1, PE currents also decreased to 72.3, 66.5, and 49.0 nA cm−2, respectively (Fig. S3a†). To confirm the effect of dispersion density of AuNRs, each sample was observed using a SEM. For 174 μg mL−1 of AuNR concentration, AuNRs were densely distributed and covered TMs completely (Fig. S3b†). When 52.2 and 17.4 μg mL−1 of AuNRs were used, AuNRs still aggregated (Fig. S3c and d†). A further decrease of AuNR concentration resulted in sparse AuNR distribution on TMs, and this led to reduction of PE currents (Fig. S3e and f†).
Photosynthesis inhibition
The origin of measured PE current was investigated by photosynthesis inhibition treatment. A 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), a well-known herbicide, blocks the quinone binding sites of PS II, where quinones become reduced and transfer Pes to the plastoquinone (PQ) pools. Addition of DCMU eventually stops continuous PE transfer in TMs and terminates photosynthesis. This DCMU inhibition test was performed to confirm the origin of PE currents. As shown in Fig. S4,† PE currents from both pure TMs and AuNR–TM conjugate samples were suppressed upon DCMU application. Any presence of residual light-triggered currents can be noise currents from the measurement system or unwanted non-photosynthetic currents.
Numerical analysis of plasmon enhancement by AuNRs
Numerical simulations of plasmon enhancement by AuNRs were also performed to understand how the geometry and distribution of AuNRs influenced plasmon near fields and plasmon energy transfer around them. The 3D models of TMs and AuNRs were constructed as reported previously.52 Briefly, the TM was assumed as a thin layer with 5 nm-thickness and AuNRs were floated above the TM with 3 nm-distance to represent the tethering molecule and elsewhere was filled with water. Since some of the AuNRs attached to TMs were close enough to affect each other and amplify plasmon intensity, plasmon near fields were simulated in two cases of AuNR distributions; (1) a single AuNR on TMs and (2) paired AuNRs on TMs (Fig. 7a and b). The contour images of plasmon enhancement were obtained around AuNRs. Then, in order to observe the dependency of the enhancement on distance from AuNRs, plasmon enhancement factors (E/Fs) were plotted along the distance from the center of a single AuNR or double AuNRs. In the case of the single AuNR, maximum E/F reached 5.36 depending on the distance from the center of the AuNR (Fig. 7c). On the other hand, for the paired AuNRs, a gap between the two AuNRs was varied to understand how the plasmon field by the two AuNRs is influenced by each other. As shown in Fig. 7d–f, maximum E/Fs were 11.69, 10.29, and 9.36 for the gaps of 5, 10, and 20 nm, respectively. This indicates that a narrower gap between AuNRs increases plasmon enhancement to a larger degree. It is also noteworthy that the E/F by paired AuNRs was much higher compared to the E/F by a single AuNR.

In each graph, the distance between AuNRs and the TM, and the TM thickness were fixed as 3 nm and 5 nm, respectively. 
Plasmon-stimulated spinach thylakoid BPV cell
A photosynthetic BPV cell was prepared using spinach-extracted TMs. The spinach-based Au–TM was deposited on a flat metal electrode. For the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at a cathode, the conventional platinum on carbon (Pt/C) air breathing electrode was employed (Fig. 8a). A BPV cell module which had a cathode holder with an air vent, an anode holder with the anolyte chamber and an anode cap with the anolyte inlet was custom fabricated (Fig. 8b and S5†). Theoretically, TMs on an anode produce PEs and protons using incident light and water, and then those PEs move via an external electric circuit while protons move to a cathode. On the cathode side, water molecules are generated using PEs, protons, and incoming oxygen. Therefore, a constructed BPV cell is expected to have an open circuit potential (OCP) in the range of 0.4 to 0.5 V since the electron carriers of TMs have their midpotentials near 0.2 to 0.3 V and the practical ORR of the Pt/C electrode is near 0.7 V.53 To observe the cell performance of the BPV cells with only TMs or Au–TM, the I–V curves were obtained by sweeping the potential from OCP to zero. Pure TMs and Au–TM had similar OCP since they had the same PEs donors, on the other hand, the short circuit current density (Jsc) of Au–TM was 0.2 μA cm−2 which was 5 fold enhanced compared to the pure TM, 0.04 μA cm−2. The maximum power (Pmax) of the Au–TM BPV cell was measured as 11 nW cm−2 while the pure TM had a lower Pmax of 3 nW cm−2 (Fig. 8c).

(j) The LED that was unlit during charging and (k) lit during discharging. (l) Charging performance changes during three continuous charging/discharging cycles of Au–TM. The spike of the 1st charging cycle is due to unexpected external noise. 
Photosynthetic BPV cells were connected in parallel and serial arrays to boost up the power output. Serial connection of individual electrochemical cells superposes individual cell potentials, whereas parallel connection of cells increases output currents. Here, two BPV cells were prepared to understand the characteristics of photosynthetic BPV cell arrays (Fig. 8d). As shown in Fig. 8e and f, cell performances were measured starting from a single BPV cell using the pure TM which had an OCP of 0.39 V, Jsc of 0.2 μA cm−2 and a Pmax of 8.5 nW cm−2. In the case of serial connection, the OCP of the cells increased to 0.8 V, while Jsc slightly decreased to 0.14 μA cm−2 possibly due to the added electrical resistance between two individual BPV cells. On the other hand, in the case of parallel connection, OCP remained in the same range of 0.4–0.5 V and Jsc was almost doubled from 0.2 to 0.38 μA cm−1.2 An identical configuration was applied to BPV cells using Au–TM. The OCP was doubled from 0.39 V to 0.85 V for serial connection, and Jsc was doubled from 0.38 μA cm−2 to 0.73 μA cm−2 for parallel connection, as expected.
For practical use of a spinach BPV cell, a power management circuit was designed to accumulate PEs in a capacitor and to operate a low-power device (Fig. 8g and h). By connecting eight BPV cells in series, a high OCP over 2.0 V was achieved. A 220 μF capacitor was installed to store produced PEs such that the potential of the capacitor slowly increased toward OCP (Fig. S6†). Previously, it was demonstrated that Au–TM generated 4 fold more PEs than the pure TM. Therefore, the capacitor was charged 6 times faster until it reached 2.0 V when Au–TM was used (Fig. 8i). Accumulated PEs were rapidly discharged by switching the circuit to power an LED (Fig. 8j and k, S7, Video S1†).
Since the charging speed is directly related to the PE generation rate of pure TMs or Au–TM, the durability of TMs significantly influences the repeated charging performance of a spinach TM BPV. Therefore, TM durability during charging/discharging cycles was investigated (Fig. 8l). In each cycle, a power management device with eight BPV cells in series was charged until it reached 1.8 V and then discharged. A plant-growing light bulb was used to trigger photosynthesis during the charging/discharging cycles. As the cycle repeated, the charging speed decreased, resulting in an increase of charging time to 2.4, 5.23 and 18.93 hours for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd charge, respectively. It is likely that the photosynthetic apparatuses of TMs were damaged by hydrogen peroxide produced from photosynthesis. This biological toxicity can be reduced by applying a reactive oxygen scavenger such as catalase.
Discussion
In this study, TMs are employed as photosynthetic energy sources due to their great advantage compared with other intact photosynthetic micro-organisms such as cyanobacteria or whole cells. Unlike the intact cells, the charge carrying molecules of TMs are exposed to the outside of the membrane. Thus, TMs can be directly applied on the surface of any charge collector. Moreover, the exposure of the molecules would lead to an easy modification of TMs with other functional nanomaterials such as conducting nanowires, nanosheets, quantum dots, chemical wires or plasmon nanoparticles.
Localized surface plasmon resonance was investigated to achieve plasmon enhancement of PE current production. It occurs when incident light with a certain wavelength generates an additional electromagnetic field around plasmon nanoparticles.54,55 This plasmon resonance influences other dipolar molecules within the field, and this is commonly called plasmon resonance energy transfer (PRET).56,57
Previously, PRET has been mainly investigated regarding interactions between semiconducting nanomaterials.58–65 In photosynthesis, in the same manner, the photosynthetic dipolar pigments such as PS and LHCs also interact with the plasmon resonance of nanomaterials.40 Therefore, several attempts have been made to study plasmonic effects between the photosynthetic apparatus and plasmonic nanoparticles41,43–46,48 or nanostructures.42,47,66 It was observed that the absorbance and fluorescence of the photosynthetic molecules were enhanced under the plasmonic effect. Therefore, we hypothesized that higher PE current could be generated from Au–TM conjugates through PRET from AuNRs to TMs (Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  Energy diagram of plasmon resonance energy transfer from attached AuNRs to LHC or PS II in the TM by AuNRs. Basically, LHC and PS II can obtain energy from incident light and produce high energy PEs at P680. In addition, they can obtain more energy from the plasmon near field of AuNRs. Plasmon resonance energy can be transferred to PS II or to LHCs. 
To transfer plasmon resonance energy from AuNRs to TMs, Au–TM must meet the following conditions; (1) wavelength match between plasmon resonance and TM absorbance, and (2) placement of TM pigments within the effective range of PRET. Firstly, P680, a reaction center in PS II, uses 680 nm light energy to produce high energy PEs.67,68 Thus, AuNRs, which have the plasmon resonance peak at 675 nm, were carefully selected as plasmonic nanoparticles for this work. Secondly, the effective distance of PRET typically extends up to 50 nm with a rapid decay by the 6th power of the distance.69 Thus, the distance between the AuNR and PS II or PS I significantly influences the degree of plasmonic enhancement in PE generation. Here, since the thickness of the TM is in the 4–5 nm range70 and the length of chemical molecules is around 3 nm, plasmonic resonance energy from AuNRs could be effectively transferred to the photosynthetic molecules of the TM.
In the simulation, maximum E/Fs by the plasmonic near field were 5.36 and 11.69 for single and double AuNRs with a 5 nm gap, respectively. However, E/F from actual experiments ranged between 4.2 and 8.4. This is due to the non-selective conjugation between the HS–PEG–NHS ester and TM. Because NHS ester was used as a functional group to react with amines (–NH2) of proteins, AuNRs could be conjugated with any protein on TM surfaces. It is ideal to attach all AuNRs to PS II which is a main contributor in high energy PE generation. However, AuNRs which are attached to other proteins of TMs are less likely to contribute to PE current enhancement.
It was previously reported that PS II had 40% number fraction on the TM surface among all photosynthetic apparatuses including PS I, cytochrome b6f (cyt b6f) complex and ATP synthase.71 In addition, each apparatus had different projected sizes (285, 190, 51, and 30 nm2 for PS II, PS I, cyt b6f, and ATP synthase, respectively). Therefore, it was calculated that the PS II complex occupied 62% area fraction among exposed photosynthetic apparatuses on the TM. Besides, the average number density of PS II on the TM was reported as ca. 1701 ± 49 μm−2 based on the electron microscopy images of freeze-fractured chloroplasts.72 Based on the average diameter of a single TM vesicle, 300 nm, a TM vesicle has about 121 PS II complexes on its surface. Also, when AuNRs on TMs were counted from SEM images in this experiment, the number of AuNRs attached on a single TM vesicle was also 120 on average. As mentioned above, AuNRs could attach on any protein on the TM surface, and thus 62% of the AuNRs could be assumed to be conjugated with PS II and this may explain the discrepancy of E/F between the simulation and measurement results. Furthermore, since a single PS II complex had a projected size of 324 nm2, a conjugation of two AuNRs with a single PS II is feasible. Therefore, due to the coexistence of single-AuNR-conjugated TMs and paired-AuNRs-conjugated TMs at the same time, plasmon E/F varied from 4.2 to 8.4 in this study.
Previously, photosynthetic BPV cells have been developed to have an enlarged electrode structure and to apply a larger quantity of photosynthetic apparatuses to increase their output power densities. While maximum power densities reached the level of tens of μW cm−2, the cell potential was still insufficient to operate practical devices.73,74 For higher output potentials, capacitive electrode materials75–77 or commercial power management systems78 have been used in BPV cells. Although capacitive electrode materials, such as graphite or carbon cloth, demonstrated the feasibility to store PEs generated from photosynthetic apparatuses, it is challenging to develop electrodes with high capacitance, high electrical conductivity and large electrochemical surface area at the same time. On the other hand, a power management system can amplify output potential using relatively small input power. However, the power management system basically needs a standby current input to be operated, and thus it is impractical for a BPV cell. In this study, the output potential of the plasmonic BPV cell was increased by connecting multiple cells in series and the output current was amplified by accumulating PEs in a capacitor. With this configuration, an output potential over 1.6 V was achieved, and an LED with 1.6 mW power consumption was successfully powered.
Conclusions
We demonstrated a multi-fold enhancement of direct harvesting of PEs by conjugating plasmonic AuNRs to spinach TMs. The plasmonic conjugation dramatically improved photon absorption and transfer of energy in a resonance form to TMs by a plasmon near field formed around the AuNRs on TMs. With this approach, the magnitude of extracted PEs from Au–TM increased 6 fold on average compared to pure TMs. The plasmon enhancement effect was analyzed using experimental and numerical studies. Furthermore, plasmon-enhanced spinach BPV cells were configured in a cell array form either with serial or parallel connection. Their operation characteristics were analyzed and by connecting eight BPV cells in series and using a power management circuit, an LED was lit successfully.
