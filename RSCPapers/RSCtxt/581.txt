, Accepted 11th June 2013First published on 11th June 2013AbstractAn effective approach to extend the light absorption range of conjugated polymers for high performance photovoltaics is synthesis of copolymers composed of at least two different chromophores with a complementary absorption range. For this purpose, we synthesized random conjugated copolymers consisting of DPP and isoindigo as co-electron accepting units in donor–acceptor type conjugated copolymers. The random copolymers exhibited both broad light absorption and low-lying HOMO level, which contribute to enhancement of JSC and VOC, respectively. Furthermore, the predominant face-on orientation of the random copolymers on the substrate is beneficial for charge transport in the device. The polymer solar cell (PSC) based on the random copolymer has shown a promising efficiency of 6.04% which is the highest value among PSCs based on random copolymers.

Broader context
Much effort has been devoted to improve the power conversion efficiency of polymer solar cells for next-generation energy resources. Although various approaches have been developed for high performance conjugated polymers as electron donor materials, the development of conjugated polymers with broad absorption (panchromatic) is strongly demanded for achieving high efficiency of solar cells, because most of the conjugated polymers typically absorb only a limited range of the solar spectrum. For this purpose, we synthesized random conjugated copolymers composed of two different chromophores (diketopyrrolopyrrole and isoindigo) with a complementary absorption range as co-electron accepting units in donor–acceptor type conjugated copolymers. Both broad light absorption and low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital level in conjunction with predominant face-on orientation of the random copolymer lead to exhibition of a promising power conversion efficiency of over 6%. The synthesis of a random copolymer provides an effective approach to achieve high performance organic solar cells with panchromatic light absorption.

Introduction
One of the most important issues for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells (PSCs) is the development of conjugated polymers which exhibit broad light absorption with strong absorptivity, high charge carrier mobility, suitable energy level matching with the electron acceptor (fullerene derivatives), and appropriate molecular orientation to form an optimum pathway of charge carriers to the corresponding electrodes.1 In the past few years, remarkable progress in the PCE surpassing 8% has been achieved with the configuration of a bulk-heterojunction network structure consisting of a high performance conjugated polymer as an electron donor and a fullerene derivative as an acceptor.2 Although the recent improvement of PCE makes the PSCs possible for practical application, the efficiencies of PSCs are still far from competing with their inorganic counterparts.3
To increase the PCE of PSCs, the intense and broad light absorption is important because the limited absorption range results in lower current density (usually less than 10 mA cm−2) in comparison with other types of solar cells (over 30 mA cm−2 in inorganic solar cells), which limits further improvement of the PCE of PSCs.4 Three promising approaches to extend the light absorption range have been used: (1) fabrication of tandem-stack solar cell devices, (2) use of a ternary (two donors and one acceptor) blend consisting of different photoactive components which have a complementary absorption range, and (3) synthesis of a random copolymer consisting of different monomers showing different absorption ranges. Although impressive advance in PCE of over 8% has been achieved using a tandem device structure, the fabrication technique is still challenging because it is not always possible to select an appropriate interconnection layer material.5 The second approach, the use of a multiple chromophore mixture in a single active layer, is also useful for achieving the broad light absorption because the absorption range can be widened as two different components with a complementary absorption range are used as active layer materials. However, the successful increase of the current density has rarely been reported, because the morphology control of the blend for the electron acceptor to be located at the boundary between two different polymer domains is extremely difficult.6 If two different polymer domains are formed side by side, the excitons generated in the polymer domains may not be easily dissociated before they recombine.
On the other hand, random copolymers consisting of two different monomers with a complementary absorption range have shown the broadening of the absorption spectrum. Li et al.7 reported the synthesis and photovoltaic application of a random copolymer showing a high PCE over 5% with broad light absorption. Nielsen et al.8 also reported a random copolymer which shows an extended absorption range yielding a 4–5% PCE. Recently a semi-random copolymer exhibiting very high current density over 16 mA cm−2 has been reported.9
In this work, we report synthesis of random conjugated copolymers in which diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP) and isoindigo are used as co-electron acceptor units in donor–acceptor (D–A) type copolymers for high efficiency PSCs. Among various building blocks for semiconducting conjugated polymers, DPP and isoindigo have frequently been used, because they are easily accessible with promising optoelectronic performances of their resultant polymers.10 Interestingly, DPP and isoindigo exhibit various properties in common, such as highly fused conjugated structure, high molar absorptivity and electron-deficient nature. These characteristics lead their polymers to exhibit low band-gap, strong π–π interactions, high crystallinity and high charge carrier mobility. However, the two units show different electrochemical properties such as the frontier molecular orbital energy levels (FMO) and band-gaps. The representative DPP-based polymer (PDPP3T), whose chemical structure is shown in Fig. 1, shows NIR absorption over 900 nm with a high-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level around −5.2 eV while the representative isoindigo-based polymer (PIT) absorbs photons shorter than 750 nm in wavelength with a low-lying HOMO level of around −5.9 eV.10 Hence, it is expected that random copolymerization of the two units can tune the absorption range and the HOMO energy level of the resulting polymer. Furthermore, since the size of DPP and isoindigo monomer units is nearly the same, as schematically shown in Fig. 2, it is expected that the random copolymers based on DPP and isoindigo are readily co-crystallized, which is beneficial for charge transport. The random copolymers composed of thiophene as the electron donor and DPP/isoindigo as the electron acceptor exhibit not only broad and intense light absorption from 500 nm to 900 nm but also low-lying HOMO levels. The grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) reveals that the random copolymers predominantly take the face-on orientation in a thin film, which would be beneficial for vertical charge transport in the device. Combination of favorable optical and electrochemical properties and high crystallinity with the face-on orientation of the random copolymers provided a promising PCE of 6.04% which is the highest PCE among random copolymer-based PSCs to the best of our knowledge.

Results and discussion
The random copolymers were synthesized via the Stille coupling reaction using a palladium catalyst, as shown in Scheme 1, and the reference homopolymers were synthesized according to the procedure reported in previous literature.11 To investigate effects of copolymer composition on properties of random copolymers, three random copolymers with different molar ratios of DPP to isoindigo (DPP/isoindigo = 0.3/07; 0.5/0.5; 0.7/0.3) were synthesized, and two homopolymers (PDPP3T and PIT) were also synthesized for comparison. Since the compositions of DPP and isoindigo in the random copolymer were nearly equal to the feed ratios (Table S2 in the ESI†), it is concluded that the reactivities of DPP and isoindigo monomers are almost the same. All the polymers synthesized in this work have similar molecular weights in the range of 20–30 kDa with narrow polydispersity and high solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and chlorobenzene (Table 1).

When the UV-Vis spectra of two homopolymers (PDPP3T and PIT) are compared, as shown in Fig. 3, PIT absorbs the light in the range of 550–750 nm with the maximum absorption (λmax) at 694 nm while PDPP3T absorbs the light in the range of 650–950 nm with the λmax at 795 nm in the solution state. The copolymer PR1 (30/70 DPP/isoindigo) exhibits slightly broader absorption than the homopolymer (PIT) while the λmax is nearly the same as PIT. The copolymer PR2 with the equal composition (50/50) of DPP and isoindigo exhibits a broader absorption range of 650–900 nm with a red-shift of λmax than PR1, while the copolymer PR3 with DPP rich composition (70/30) shows slight red-shift but the absorption intensity and range are weaker and narrower than PR2. In the film state (Fig. 3b), the absorption spectra of all the polymers exhibit broader absorption with red-shift as compared to the solution spectra, while the effect of copolymer composition on the absorption behavior exhibits the same trend as the absorption in solution. It should be noted here that the absorption spectra of random copolymers are roughly equal to the sum of two homopolymer absorptions. When the full-width half-maxima (FWHM) of absorption spectra, representing quantitatively the absorption range, are compared (Table 1), it is revealed that the FWHMs of copolymers are larger than the two homopolymers, indicating that the absorption ranges of random copolymers are broader than those of homopolymers. Particularly, the absorption spectrum of PR2 is nearly equal to the sum of absorptions of PDPP3T and PIT (Fig. S1†). Therefore, the random copolymers with extended light absorption would provide strong potential for achieving panchromatic PSCs.

The FMO energy levels of random copolymers and reference homopolymers in the thin film state were measured by cyclic voltammetry (Table 1 and Fig. S2†). The HOMO levels of PIT and PDPP3T were −5.65 and −5.35 eV, respectively, which are very consistent with the literature values,10b,j while PR1, PR2 and PR3 have HOMO levels of −5.50, −5.62 and −5.63 eV, respectively, which are rather close to that of PIT. These low HOMO levels of random copolymers would be beneficial for obtaining high open circuit voltage (VOC) of PSCs. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PR1, PR2 and PR3 are −3.79, −3.89 and −3.85 eV, respectively, affording the LUMO–LUMO offset between polymer and PC71BM (−4.2 eV) of over 0.3 eV, which ensures efficient exciton dissociation.12
PSC devices were fabricated with the conventional structure, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al, where the active layer was composed of conjugated copolymer and PC71BM. When the blend ratio of polymer to PC71BM was changed for optimization of the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, it was found that the optimum ratio was 1 to 2. Fig. 4 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of optimized PSCs, and relevant photovoltaic properties are listed in Table 2. The best PCEs of PR1, PR2 and PR3 were 3.49%, 6.04%, and 4.93%, respectively (Fig. S3 and Table S1†). For comparison, we also fabricated PSCs from two homopolymers (PDPP3T and PIT), which show PCEs of 4.5% and 3.43%, respectively, which are very much comparable to the literature values.10b,j Therefore, it is concluded that the random copolymers show better efficiencies than the corresponding homopolymers. The copolymer PR2 shows the highest JSC, because PR2 exhibits broad and strong absorption, as can be seen in Fig. 3. It should be noted here that PR2 synthesized in different batches exhibits a similar performance close to 6% (see Fig. S9 and Table S2 in the ESI†). The extinction coefficient of PR2 (ε = 3.7 × 104 L−1 mol−1) is much higher than that of PDPP3T and comparable to that of PIT, although PR2 has the equal composition of DPP and isoindigo. Along with the intense light absorption, PR2 has broad light absorption in the range of 600–900 nm in wavelength, i.e., PR2 has the largest FWHM of the absorption band. These two factors of strong and broad absorptions contribute to high JSC. The panchromatic absorption characteristics of random copolymers were also evident in wide and strong incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra, as shown in Fig. 4b.

When the VOCs of PSCs based on random copolymers are compared with those of two homopolymers, the PSCs based on random copolymers exhibit intermediate VOCs between the two homopolymers. The VOC of PR1 is 0.78 V, which is slightly lower than that of PIT (0.81 V), while the VOC (0.69 V) of PR3 is considerably higher than that of PDPP3T (0.63 V). Particularly, the VOC of PR2 (0.77 V) is significantly higher than the arithmetic mean value (0.72 V) of two homopolymer VOCs. Note that the VOCs of random copolymers are very consistent with HOMO energy levels.
The crystallinity of a conjugated polymer is another important factor for achieving high JSC of PSCs, because highly crystalline polymers afford efficient charge carrier transport. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) reveals that both homopolymers (PDPP3T and PIT) exhibit similar melting points, as shown in Fig. S5.† However, the random copolymer PR1 does not show a melting point while PR2 and PR3 show a clear melting point, indicating that the random copolymers (PR2 and PR3) have semi-crystalline characteristics, which may facilitate the hole transport affording high JSC. The structural information such as molecular orientation, intermolecular distance and crystallite size of PR2 in thin films was further investigated by the grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The out-of-plane (qz) scan for an as-spun thin film of PR2 does not show a characteristic diffraction peak in the range of 0.1–0.5 Å−1, while a broad and strong diffraction peak is observed at qz = 1.62 Å−1, which is associated with π–π stacking with a d-spacing of 3.8 Å, as shown in Fig. 5a, indicating that most polymer chains take the face-on orientation on the substrate. When PR2 was thermally annealed, the (100) scattering peak was clearly seen at qz = 0.30 Å−1, corresponding to an interchain distance of 20.9 Å with two small peaks of (200) and (300) reflections while the (010) peak was still broad and strong, indicating that thermal annealing enhances polymer crystallinity. The in-plane (qxy) scans of GIWAXS reveal that the as-spun film of PR2 exhibits an intense (100) peak at qxy = 0.31 Å−1 corresponding to the interchain distance of 20.3 Å, which is slightly shorter than that in the qz direction, indicating that polymer crystallites in the face-on orientation are more densely packed than those in the edge-on orientation. After the samples are thermally annealed, the (100) peak of the qxy scan becomes stronger while the (200) and (300) peaks are distinctly grown. Furthermore, the (100), (200) and (300) peaks in qxy are sharper and stronger than those in qz, while the (010) peak in qxy is weaker than that in qz. This indicates that PR2 takes predominantly the face-on orientation in a thin film, as depicted in Fig. 5e. PR2 molecules in the PR2/PC71BM blend also take preferentially the face-on orientation, as shown in Fig. 5c and d. The out-of-plane (qz) of PR2 in the blend exhibits a strong and broad peak composed of two peaks at qz = 1.35 Å−1 and at qz = 1.62 Å−1, corresponding to the PC71BM scattering peak and the (010) peak of PR2, respectively. Addition of DIO makes the (h00) peaks more discernible, while the (010) peak remains unchanged. This preferential face-on orientation of PR2 is beneficial for charge transport in the solar cell device and thus contributes to high JSC.

To assess the vertical charge transport, the hole mobility is measured by the standard method using a single charge-carrier device. The single-carrier mobility is extracted from the dark current density–voltage (JD–V) curve and is calculated by the trap-free space charge limited current (SCLC) model at low reverse applied voltage using the Mott–Gurney square law, J = (9/8)ε0εrμ(V2/L3), where ε0 is vacuum permittivity, εr is the dielectric constant of the polymer (assumed as 2.75 for the polymers), μ is the drift mobility of each charge carrier, V is the effective applied voltage, and L is the thickness of the polymer film (Fig. S4†). The hole mobilities of PR1, PR2 and PR3 are 0.046, 0.102 and 0.023 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while PIT and PDPP3T show the hole mobilities of 0.012 and 0.009 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Particularly, PR2 exhibits the highest hole mobility due to high crystallinity with preferential face-on orientation of crystallites in a thin film. Therefore, integration of high hole mobility and broad light absorption of PR2 leads to the highest JSC.
The JSC of PSC is also related to the morphology of the active layer in PSCs. Particularly, when the morphology of PR2/PC71BM without DIO is compared with that of PR2/PC71BM with addition of DIO, as shown in Fig. 6, it is realized that the blend without DIO shows macroscopic phase separation between PR2 and PC71BM while the blend with addition of DIO exhibits a fibrillar structure with nanoscale domain size. Other copolymers exhibit the same morphological behavior, although their domain sizes are larger than that of PR2. When the morphological change of PR2 in a blend film is examined by transmission resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS), the addition of DIO dramatically reduces the domain size from ca. 100 to 18 nm, which is very consistent with the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation, as show in Fig. 6c. This morphological development upon addition of DIO enhances charge generation and transport in the active layer, leading to high JSC of a PR2-based PSC. It should be mentioned here that the addition of DIO enhances largely JSC while the FF is nearly unchanged or slightly decreased (see Fig. S3 and Table S1†). Similar to our result, several research groups reported that there was no significant improvement in FF while JSC was largely enhanced.13 For instance, Ye et al.13c have demonstrated that the additive not only reduces the domain size of the active layer but also blurs the sharpness of the domain interface, and therefore the enhanced bi-molecular recombination at the rough interface leads to the reduction in FF upon addition of the additive.

Conclusion
We synthesized random conjugated D–A type copolymers with two accepting units, DPP and isoindigo, for achieving PSCs with panchromatic light absorption. The optical and electrochemical properties of a random copolymer were optimized by varying the ratio of the two acceptor units in copolymers. PR2 containing equal amounts of DPP and isoindigo in the copolymer absorbs a wide range of the solar spectrum from 600 to 900 nm with low HOMO level, which is beneficial for achieving high performance PSCs. Furthermore, the random copolymers have a semi-crystalline nature along with preferential face-on orientation on the substrate, which facilitates effective charge transport in the vertical direction to the electrode. The morphology analysis reveals that an addition of DIO effectively reduces the domain size, which also contributes to efficient charge transport for high JSC of PSCs. Under optimized conditions, PR2-based PSC exhibits a promising PCE of 6.04% with a VOC of 0.77 V, a JSC of 13.52 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.58, which are superior to the values of the two homopolymers. Therefore, the synthesis of a random conjugated copolymer provides a potential approach to achieve high performance organic solar cells with panchromatic light absorption.
Experimental
Synthesis of copolymers
For synthesis of PR1, a mixture of 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene (0.100 mmol), dibrominated DPP (0.030 mmol), dibrominated isoindigo (0.070 mmol) and 7.0 mg of bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride (10 μmol) in 6 ml of anhydrous toluene was refluxed for 24 h under nitrogen, followed by end-capping using 2-bromothiophene and 2-tributyltinthiophene successively. After cooling down to room temperature, the solution was precipitated in methanol, filtered, and then purified by Soxhlet extraction successively with methanol, acetone, hexane, and then chloroform. Finally the chloroform fraction was concentrated, and then precipitated in methanol. The dark purple solid was obtained after filtering by a PTFE filter and dried overnight in 85% yield. PR2 and PR3 were synthesized by following the same procedure for synthesis of PR1 except for the amount of DPP and isoindigo (0.050 mmol and 0.050 mmol, respectively for PR2; 0.070 mmol and 0.030 mmol, respectively for PR3). The yield of PR2 and PR3 were 68% and 77%, respectively. PIT and PDPP3T were synthesized by following the procedure reported in previous literature.10
Characterization
1H NMR spectra were obtained from a Bruker Avance 500 MHz NMR spectrometer with deuterated chloroform as a solvent. Size exclusion chromatography was performed at room temperature on an Agilent 1200 GPC System (eluted with CHCl3). The molecular weights were calculated according to relative calibration with polystyrene standards. UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured with a Lambda 25 (Perkin Elmer) spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out on a potentiostat/galvanostat (VMP3, Biologic) in an electrolyte solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in acetonitrile using gold electrodes as a counter and a working electrode, respectively, and silver/silver ions (Ag in an 0.1 M AgNO3 solution) were used as a reference electrode. The thermal properties of polymers were measured by DSC (TA-Q200) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The thin film morphology was observed by TEM (JEM1010) operating at 80 kV of acceleration voltage. GIWAXS scans were obtained at the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. An X-ray beam was impinged onto the sample at a grazing angle above and below the critical angle of the polymer film (αc = 0.16), but below the critical angle of the silicon substrate (αc = 0.22). RSoXS spectra were obtained using a transmission geometry with the beam energy of 284.4 eV which generally probes the carbon edge resonance.
Fabrication and characterization of the devices
The architecture of the solar cell device used in this work is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al. The active layer solution was spin coated onto the PEDOT:PSS (Clevious AI 4083)-coated ITO glass. For optimization, a mixture of chlorobenzene and diiodooctane was used as a solvent. After the active layer was dried completely, Ca (10 nm) and Al (100 nm) were thermally deposited as the cathode under 4 × 10−6 Torr. The photovoltaic performance was measured under nitrogen atmosphere inside a glove box. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 4200 source-meter under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) simulated by a Newport-Oriel solar simulator. The light intensity was calibrated using a NREL-certified photodiode and light source meter prior to each measurement. The active area was 0.04 cm2. The IPCE was measured using a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under a short circuit current state with illumination of monochromatic light.

Broader context
Much effort has been devoted to improve the power conversion efficiency of polymer solar cells for next-generation energy resources. Although various approaches have been developed for high performance conjugated polymers as electron donor materials, the development of conjugated polymers with broad absorption (panchromatic) is strongly demanded for achieving high efficiency of solar cells, because most of the conjugated polymers typically absorb only a limited range of the solar spectrum. For this purpose, we synthesized random conjugated copolymers composed of two different chromophores (diketopyrrolopyrrole and isoindigo) with a complementary absorption range as co-electron accepting units in donor–acceptor type conjugated copolymers. Both broad light absorption and low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital level in conjunction with predominant face-on orientation of the random copolymer lead to exhibition of a promising power conversion efficiency of over 6%. The synthesis of a random copolymer provides an effective approach to achieve high performance organic solar cells with panchromatic light absorption.
