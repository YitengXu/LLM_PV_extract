    , Accepted 15th January 2019First published on 16th January 2019AbstractUtilising photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices to produce sustainable fuels from water and CO2 is a very attractive strategy, in which sunlight is used to convert the greenhouse gas (CO2) into a usable form of stored chemical energy. While significant progress has been made in the development of efficient photoactive catalysts for PEC reactions, limited efforts have been focused on the reactor design where continuous flow microfluidic PEC reactors are particular promising. In this work, a range of CuO-based thin films were used as photocathodes in a continuous flow microfluidic PEC reactor using CO2-saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution under simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiation for up to 12 h. The highest photocurrent density obtained was for the α-Fe2O3/CuO photoelectrode yielding −1.0 mA cm−2 at 0.3 V vs. RHE and initial results indicated a solar-to-fuel (STF) efficiency of 0.48%. While the CuO, Cu2O and CuO–Cu2O photoelectrodes virtually only formed formate, the bilayer α-Fe2O3/CuO photocathode produced methanol in addition to formate indicating that combined copper and iron oxides in continuous flow microfluidic PEC cells have great potential of direct solar conversion into useful chemicals.
Introduction
Solar renewable energy could offer a sustainable alternative solution to deal with global warming and fossil fuel depletion. Since sunlight is considered to be the most abundant energy source, especially in converting CO2 into useful hydrocarbon products,1 the production of solar fuel from water and CO2 has attracted much attention.2,3 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO2 reduction cells using semiconducting photoelectrodes have been studied as an alternative and promising approach to PEC water splitting applications.4–6 Although PEC CO2 reduction has been proven feasible, the physicochemical mechanisms involved in the production of carbon-based chemicals at a semiconductor–liquid electrolyte junction are very complicated and challenging.7
The PEC CO2 reduction process is initiated when incident photons are absorbed by a semiconducting material, leading to the creation of electron–hole pairs. Then, the photogenerated charge carriers, driven by the space-charge field, flow to the interface of the semiconductor/liquid electrolyte, in which water oxidation (oxygen evolution reaction – OER) or CO2 reduction into chemicals, such as CO, HCOOH, CH3OH, take place. In other words, PEC CO2 reduction devices involve two half-cell reactions with different kinetics.4 Despite a large number of efforts being made since Halmann reported a PEC CO2 reduction cell for the first time in 1978,8 this technology is still in its early stage of development. A plethora of promising p-type (photocathodes) and n-type (photoanodes) semiconducting materials has been studied, revealing that photocathode-driven devices for CO2 conversion into carbon-based chemicals can achieve higher efficiency and selectivity.9 This is mainly related to the fact that in PEC CO2 reduction cells, p-type semiconductors are coupled with selective and efficient OER catalysts such as Pt, while n-type semiconductors are coupled with electrodes that enable the CO2 reduction half-reaction such as Cu-based materials showing low selectivity and efficiency due to the competitive water reduction reaction (hydrogen evolution).10–13
A p-type semiconducting candidate should absorb a large part of the solar spectrum and simultaneously its conduction band edge should lie at a more negative potential than that of the CO2 reduction reaction potential.14 Among these materials, copper oxides seem attractive due to their low cost and abundance, chemical stability and toxicity in comparison with other photocathodic materials. Hence, photocathodes based on cupric oxide (CuO) were synthesized for PEC CO2 reduction into carbon-based chemicals.
PEC CO2 reduction systems suffer from low solar-to-fuel (STF) efficiencies that do not exceed 1.2%, the highest yet recorded.15 The theoretical efficiency limitations of PEC reactions that occur on the electrode/liquid electrolyte interface at a molecular level highly depend on transport phenomena.16 A promising route to enhance the performance of PEC CO2 reduction cells is to promote mass transfer of the reactants, intermediates and products at the electrode/liquid electrolyte interface. Therefore, PEC cells should be designed in shape and dimensions that promote transfer of reactants, intermediates and products to and from the active sites of the electrodes. In this study, the performance of a newly-designed continuous microfluidic PEC cell was evaluated using CuO-based photocathodes for PEC CO2 reduction highlighting the significance of reactor design and igniting a discussion about the benefits of a microscale-based PEC cell approach.
Experimental
Preparation of photocathodes

Synthesis of CuO and Cu2O thin films. 
Initially, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass purchased from Pilkington (8 Ω sq−1) was cut into rectangular pieces and used as substrates. Then, these pieces of FTO glass were ultrasonically cleaned in ethanol and acetone for 30 min, followed by rinsing with deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C) and dried in air. CuO and Cu2O thin films were synthesized on FTO glass using an electrodeposition method performed on an Autolab PGSTAT 302N electrochemical workstation. As illustrated in Scheme 1a, the electrodeposition of CuO and Cu2O thin films was carried out using a 3-electrode set-up that consisted of FTO glass as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (KCl 1 M) as the reference electrode and Pt foil as the counter electrode. Only a certain area (1 cm × 1 cm for linear sweep voltammetry experiments and 3 cm × 1 cm for CO2 reduction experiments) was exposed to the aqueous electrodeposition solution containing 50 mM potassium perchlorate (KClO4 >99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 4 mM copper(II) nitrate trihydrate (CuNO3·3H2O >99%, Sigma-Aldrich).15,17 Working electrodes were held at a constant potential of −0.33 V vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The thickness of the films was controlled by varying the deposition time ranging from 30–180 min. After drying, the electrodeposited thin films on FTO substrates were annealed at 600 °C for 2 h with a heating ramp of 5 °C min−1 in the air or Ar atmosphere to fabricate CuO or Cu2O electrodes, respectively. CuO/Cu2O photocathodes were also fabricated using the same electrodeposition method. CuO thin films were synthesized on FTO glass followed by Cu2O deposition on the CuO layer.

Synthesis of Fe2O3 thin film. 
Nanostructured Fe2O3 thin films were synthesized on FTO glass using a hydrothermal synthesis method, which was carried out in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (Scheme 1b). Briefly, an aqueous hydrothermal solution was prepared containing 0.15 M iron chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O >98%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 M sodium nitrate (NaNO3 >99%, Sigma-Aldrich).18,19 A few drops of hydrochloric acid (HCl 36.5–38%, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to adjust the pH of the solution to 1.5. FTO substrates were placed with the conductive side facing down in autoclave filled with hydrothermal solution. The autoclave was sealed tightly and heated at 100 °C for 3, 6 and 12 h in an oven. After that, the autoclave was naturally cooled down to room temperature and the samples were rinsed with deionized water. Subsequently, a uniform orange thin film (β-FeOOH) deposited on the FTO glass was sintered in air at 600 °C for 3 h with a heating ramp of 5 °C min−1. As a result, a dark red colour thin film was obtained. After that, the electrodeposition method used to synthesize the CuO thin film was used to fabricate another layer on top of the dark red coloured thin film.

Materials characterization
Optical absorption of all samples was obtained using a UV-Vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 950) equipped with a 150 mm integration sphere. Energy band-gaps of the bare semiconducting materials were calculated using the Kubelka–Munk formula:20,21 (1)where R is the reflectance (absolute values). Crystalline structures of all samples were investigated with a D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker AXS) with Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a nickel beta filter (2θ = 10–80°). Particle size of all sample electrodes was examined with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM, FEI Quanta 3D FEG) at an accelerated voltage of 10 kV. In addition, a FEI Scios dual-beam microscope equipped with an Octane Plus EDS (Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis, EDAX) detector was used for compositional analysis of electrodes. High resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, FEI Titan Themis 200) equipped with EDX detector operated at 200 kV was used to examine the nanostructure of the thin film. Prior to TEM experiments, iron oxide particles were diluted in ethanol, sonicated for 5 min and a few drops of this solution were placed on a carbon coated Cu grid.
Fabrication of microfluidic cell
Two different reactors were fabricated for the PEC experiments, as described here. A polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) homemade batch reactor was fabricated using a Trotec Speedy 300 laser engraver/cutter. The distance between the working and counter electrode was fixed at 10 mm while the total volume of the reactor was 15 mL (50 mm × 30 mm × 10 mm). This reactor was assembled with working electrode, counter electrode and a PMMA chamber. In addition, two stainless steel plates were used to hold together the cell (PEC reactor 1 – PECR1). A similar reactor with an inlet and outlet of electrolyte was used for the continuous flow PEC measurements. A sandwich-type microfluidic photo-reactor was also designed and fabricated with a working and counter electrode at the bottom and top part of the photo-reactor as illustrated in Scheme 2. A PMMA sheet (100 μm thickness) was cut by Trotec Speedy 300 laser engraver/cutter. Then, the PMMA sheet was placed in between the two electrodes creating a reaction chamber. Finally, two gaskets of a thermoplastic film (Surlyn 30 μm, Dyesol) were cut and placed between the PMMA layer and electrodes in order to seal the reactor (PEC reactor 2 – PECR2). The total volume of the microchamber was ≈50 μL (31 mm × 10 mm × 0.16 mm).

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements

J–V measurements (linear sweep voltammetry) were conducted in the homemade batch reactor as described above. They were performed on an Autolab PGSTAT 302N electrochemical workstation in a 3-electrode configuration consisting of FTO/photocatalyst working electrode (photoelectrode), Ag/AgCl (KCl 1 M) reference electrode and Pt foil as the counter electrode at room temperature. Although Pt is not considered as the best catalyst for water oxidation, it is widely used in PEC CO2 reduction studies.9 Among the best catalysts for the water oxidation reaction are IrO2 and RuO2.22 However, in this study, Pt electrodes were selected due to their stability and because they allowed a more fair comparison with the literature. The illuminated surface area of the photoelectrode in direct contact with the electrolyte was 1 cm × 1 cm. The electrolyte for all PEC experiments was 0.2 M NaHCO3 purged with high purity CO2 (99.99%) or N2 (99.99%) for 30 min prior to the experiment. NaHCO3 was chosen due to its stability in CO2 reduction experiments and enhanced CO2 solubility.23–25 All PEC experiments were performed under continuous or chopped irradiation using a Newport 92250A solar simulator (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) as the light source. During irradiation of the backside (the side that is not contact with the electrolyte) of the photoelectrodes, potentials were swept from −0.6 to 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a scan rate ranging from 1 to 5 mV s−1. However, the potentials with respect to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode were re-calculated and converted to these with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) via the following equation: VRHE = VAg/AgCl + 0.222V + 0.059V × pH(2)
It should be mentioned that the pH of N2-purged 0.2 M NaHCO3 solution was 8.4, while the pH for the CO2-purged solution decreased down to 6.6. In other words, CO2 purging affected the calculated values for the conversion of VAg/AgCl to VRHE.
The efficiency of the as-prepared photoelectrodes for PEC CO2 conversion into carbon-based products was further evaluated with a 2-electrode configuration in both types of reactors. CO2-purged solution was supplied to PECR1 and PECR2 using a syringe pump (Genie Touch, Kent Scientific Corporation). The liquid flow rate was in the range of 40, 80, 120 and 200 μL min−1. Finally, the liquid solution was collected from the outlet and analyzed. CO2 conversion into methanol was confirmed and quantified using a Bruker AVIII 300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. 1H NMR allowed the quantification of all liquid phase products identified in these experiments. Standard curves were made using purchased chemicals of interest with internal standards in 0.2 NaHCO3. During the PEC experiments, a fraction of electrolyte was collected (1 mL) from the outlet of the reactor and mixed with deuterium oxide (D2O, 99.9% Sigma-Aldrich) and dioxane that served as an internal standard. Specifically, 606 μL of sampled electrolyte solution, 24 μL of 5.86 mM aqueous dioxane solution and 70 μL of D2O were placed in NMR tubes (Norell, 5 mm ultra-precision). Finally, the product peak areas were compared to the internal standard curves to quantify the concentration of CO2 produced by the reduction reaction enabling the estimation of STF efficiency through the following relationship:9,26 (3)where r is the amount of chemical fuel produced (mmol) per second, ΔG0 is the Gibbs free energy for conversion of gaseous CO2 into the produced fuel, Psolar is the power density of the light source (AM 1.5 G) and surface area is the irradiated photoelectrode area exposed to the electrolyte solution. Overall STF efficiency is calculated by summing the STF efficiencies of every different obtained product.
Results and discussion
Photoelectrode characterization
The films of CuO and Cu2O on FTO glass in this study were synthesized using an electrodeposition method. FTO glass was utilized as the substrates because it is transparent (allowing the back illumination of the photoelectrode), electrically conductive, resistant to high temperatures and rigid, avoiding cracks of the synthesized photocatalyst due to bending. The crystal structures of the as-prepared semiconducting materials were initially analysed by XRD as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The XRD patterns of electrodeposited and sintered in air CuO samples showed diffraction peaks that matched the monoclinic crystal structure (JCDPS no. 80–1917).27 Specifically, CuO diffraction peaks were detected at 2θ = 32.6°, 35.6°, 38.8°, 48.9°, 53.7°, 58.5°, 66.4°, 42.6° and 73.9° corresponding to (100), (002), (111, 200), (−202), (020), (202), (022) (220) and (311) crystal planes, respectively. In addition, no characteristic peaks related to Cu2O, Cu(OH)2 or metallic Cu were detected. The Cu2O samples that were electrodeposited and annealed in Ar atmosphere presented two main diffraction peaks at 2θ = 68.2° and 72.7° that were assigned to (200) and (311) cubic crystal structure planes of Cu2O (JCPDS no. 05-0667).28,29 In this sample, a weak peak (2θ = 50.3°) was detected, which indicates the presence of metallic Cu impurities. XRD spectra of CuO/Cu2O photoelectrodes showed that both monoclinic CuO and cubic Cu2O crystal structure planes evidenced the formation of a heterojunction layer on FTO. Fig. 1a also shows the XRD patterns of iron oxide films with diffraction peaks at 2θ = 33.1°, 35.6° and 64° that were attributed to (104), (110) and (300) hematite structure planes (JCPDS no. 33-0664). This means that pure rhombohedral phase α-Fe2O3 was hydrothermally synthesized on FTO substrates without any peak indicating the presence of other iron oxide states or metallic Fe after annealing at 600 °C for 3 h in air. Both hematite and CuO characteristic diffraction peaks were observed in α-Fe2O3/CuO samples indicating the presence of both hematite and CuO on FTO substrate.

(c) Plots of the transformed Kubelka–Munk function versus the energy of absorbed light for pure CuO, Cu2O and a-Fe2O3 on FTO. 
In Fig. 1b, the UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra of the as-synthesized Cu2O, CuO, CuO/Cu2O, α-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3/CuO films on FTO glass are illustrated. A sharp decrease in reflectance at about 560 nm was observed for sample α-Fe2O3. Likewise, an abrupt increase in reflectance at 570 nm was presented for the Cu2O electrode, while the reflection edge was extended to almost 900 nm for the CuO/Cu2O electrode. However, a sharp decrease above the wavelength corresponding to the energy band gap of both semiconducting materials is not observed as expected, which is attributed to the presence of authorized energy states within the forbidden energy region. Such states can be associated with oxygen vacancies that can be found in metal oxides synthesized via electrodeposition or facile hydrothermal routes. Even after the annealing process at high temperatures, oxygen vacancies can be created due to oxygen that stems from metal oxides.30 The α-Fe2O3/CuO sample showed two shoulders in the reflectance spectrum due to the presence of two semiconducting materials. In general, all CuO-based films showed a broadband absorption in the wavelength region between 400–900 nm due to the low band gap energy of CuO. The band gap of CuO, Cu2O and Fe2O3 was estimated to be 1.4, 2 and 2.1 eV, respectively, that matched well with the reported literature.15,31–33
The morphology of the samples was investigated using SEM, TEM and EDX mapping. Fig. 2a shows a top view of micro-coral arrays consisting of cubic-liked CuO particles ranging from 100 to 300 nm. In the top cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 2b), the as-sythesized CuO photoelectrodes exhibited 2 μm thickness after 1 h of electrodeposition time. It should be mentioned that the thickness of the CuO thin films could be easily controlled by changing the electrodeposition time. The optimised electrodeposition time (1 h) for the PEC CO2 reduction process was investigated and confirmed by electrochemical measurements of solar irradiated electrodes as shown in the following sub-section. The existence of micro-voids inside the CuO structures or in between the FTO substrate and the CuO layer could be the reason for the high electrochemically active surface area in all CuO-based photoelectrodes (Fig. 2b). For a more detailed analysis of the element distribution, EDAX mapping of the bare CuO film on FTO was conducted. EDAX (Fig. 2c) revealed that the glass layer at the bottom, which consisted of silicon and oxygen, was covered with a conductive layer of ∼100 nm thickness that consisted of Sn. On top of the Sn layer, the electrodeposited layer consisted of Cu and O, confirming the successive deposition of a uniformly thin CuO film. In addition, large voids (300–500 nm) between the Cu2O particles were observed (Fig. 2d).

The SEM photo of the hydrothermally synthesized α-Fe2O3 sample (Fig. 2e) revealed the formation of well-distributed hematite nanorods oriented upward. A typical hematite nanorod was approximately 500 nm in length and 50 nm in diameter and its elemental composition was confirmed through EDX elemental mapping (Fig. 2g). Most of the hematite nanorods have the as-described dimensions and morphology but it can be seen in the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 2f), that a few nanorods had significantly larger length and diameter. This can be attributed to different localized conditions in the autoclave, which is one of the main disadvantages of batch hydrothermal synthesis methods.34 As illustrated in Fig. 2h, some of these large nanorods were covered with cube-like CuO particles highlighting the full coverage of each substrate via this electrodeposition method. In addition, the surface area of the semiconducting material was significantly increased when CuO particles were electrodeposited on hematite nanorods. The cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 2i) of the α-Fe2O3/CuO sample illustrated the presence of a bilayer structure consisting of a CuO layer of ∼2 μm thickness deposited (1 h deposition time) on a hematite nanorods layer of 200–400 nm (6 h hydrothermal synthesis). Finally, EDAX elemental mapping confirmed that Fe is well-distributed between the conductive substrate of FTO glass and CuO layer (Fig. 2j).
PEC CO2 reduction
PEC activity of the selected as-synthesized photoelectrodes was investigated in CO2-purged 0.2 M NaHCO3 aqueous solution. Fig. 3 shows the current density as a function of potential under solar light illumination (AM 1.5 G; 100 mW cm−2). CuO and Cu2O photoelectrodes showed a reductive photocurrent corresponding to PEC CO2 reduction.15,17,35,36 More specifically, a positive onset potential of ∼0.8 V vs. RHE was achieved for bare CuO electrodes (Fig. 3a). The effect of CuO layer thickness was scrutinized because this property has a great impact on light absorption properties and resistance that play a crucial role in PEC activity of photoelectrodes.37 Although CuO thickness did not affect the onset potential, the photoresponse was notably enhanced leading to a photocurrent density of −0.80 from −0.55 mA cm−2 at 0.25 V vs. RHE when CuO electrodeposition time increased from 30 to 60 min. However, a further increase in electrodeposition time resulted in a decreased photoresponse. In general, the photoabsorber’s thickness can influence the photoelectrochemical activity because there is a trade-off relation between charge collection and light absorption.37 For instance, a thin film enables efficient collection of holes at the back contact of the photoabsorber and electrons at the photoabsorber–electrolyte interface to drive the CO2 reduction reaction but achieves low light absorption. On the other hand, although thick photoabsorber layers exhibit enhanced light absorption, electron and hole recombination limits the electron transfer process at the semiconductor interface and thus hinders subsequent oxidation or reduction reactions. Therefore, it is crucial to optimise these two key factors in order to synthesize the optimal CuO film on FTO substrate. The same trend of photoabsorber thickness on photoresponse of photoelectrodes was observed in bare Cu2O samples. Generally, Cu2O showed significantly lower PEC performance than CuO films and this was attributed to lower absorbance of solar light (larger band gap) and the presence of empty spaces on the surface of FTO glass after electrodeposition and calcination steps. In addition, for both CuO and Cu2O photoelectrodes, anomalies were observed in the J–V curves at 0.75 and 0.90 V vs. RHE, which are attributed to Cu2+, Cu+ or Cu2O reduction, respectively, under illumination and applied bias potential.38
 Fig. 3  Current density vs. potential (J–V) curves of (a) CuO, (b) Cu2O, (c) α-Fe2O3 and (d) α-Fe2O3/CuO photoelectrodes in 0.2 M NaHCO3 showing the effect of electrodeposition or hydrothermal synthesis time. All the J–V curves were obtained under continuous or chopped illumination of solar light (AM 1.5 G; 100 mW cm−2) in PECR1. 
PEC performance of hematite nanorod arrays on FTO was also studied showing a water-oxidizing photoanode behaviour. The optimum hydrothermal synthesis time was determined based on the PEC activity of the photoelectrodes. In hydrothermal synthesis, increasing the growth time will result in longer nanorods causing two opposite phenomena: (i) enhanced light absorption that increases PEC activity and (ii) broadening of the length that photogenerated electrons must diffuse in order to be collected at the FTO back contact that decreases the PEC activity. However, hematite photocatalyst has a very short lifetime of its photogenerated charge carriers (<10 ps), and thus, only very thin hematite films can be used in PEC applications.39
Hematite photoelectrodes with hydrothermal growth time of 6 h presented the highest photoresponse (Fig. 3c). In particular, a photocurrent density of 0.1 mA cm−2 at 1.20 V vs. RHE and an onset potential of 0.9 V were recorded. The best hematite nanorod thin films deposited on FTO glass were used as substrates for CuO electrodeposition. Therefore, a p–n bilayer photoelectrode was formed as can be seen from SEM-EDAX images (Fig. 1a and c) and J–V curves (Fig. 3a and c). The PEC activity of these samples is presented in Fig. 3d as a function of electrodeposition time of CuO. Thus, the effect of CuO thickness over hematite nanorod arrays on the overall PEC performance of photoelectrodes was explored. However, a similar behavior to the CuO and Cu2O samples was obtained showing that the optimal electrodeposition time was 1 h. The α-Fe2O3/CuO samples prepared under optimal synthesis conditions (6 h hydrothermal synthesis time of hematite thin film and 1 h electrodeposition time of the CuO photoelectrodes) reproducibly achieved photocurrent densities of −1.20 mA cm−2 at 0.3 V vs. RHE and onset potentials of 0.7 V vs. RHE.
The enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of CuO layer loaded on Fe2O3 nanorods compared to bare CuO (Fig. 4a) can be attributed to the increased surface area as observed in SEM images, and formation of a p–n heterojunction at the interface between the two photocatalysts. Specifically, p–n junctions can provide effective separation of the photogenerated charge carriers and thereby enhance the overall photoelectrochemical activity of the α-Fe2O3/CuO photoelectrode. Another factor that can lead to enhanced current densities of mixed copper and iron oxide photoelectrodes for CO2 reduction is a synergistic effect between Cu and Fe particles.17,40,41

(b) Linear sweep voltammograms of α-Fe2O3/CuO electrodes in 0.2 M NaHCO3 electrolyte solutions purged with N2 (red) or CO2 (black). Both J–V curves were obtained under chopped illumination of solar light (AM 1.5 G; 100 mW cm−2) (PECR1). 
To determine if charge transfer is selective to CO2 reduction compared to hydrogen production through water splitting, linear sweep voltammetry measurements were conducted for both N2 and CO2 pre-purged electrolyte. As presented in Fig. 4b, the onset potential for N2-purged electrolyte was approximately 0.75 V vs. RHE, while for CO2-purged electrolyte the onset potential was anodically shifted to 0.90 V vs. RHE indicating that the α-Fe2O3/CuO heterojunction could be an efficient photoelectrode for CO2 conversion into fuels. In addition, enhanced photocurrent density in CO2-purged NaHCO3 electrolyte can be attributed to the fact that both water and dissolved CO2 can serve as electron acceptors in PEC cells. Finally, it should also be mentioned that sharp spikes observed in each chop cycle of all chop-lighted linear sweep voltammograms corresponded to capacity currents.42 This effect is more intense in p–n junctions because of the formation of a depletion layer between CuO and α-Fe2O3 layer that results in additional capacitance in the photoelectrode.43
The majority of PEC reduction of CO2 studies has focused on the development of materials with high PEC activity utilising laboratory-scale batch reactors for their evaluation. Generally, only a few studies have explored the effect of continuous flow reactors in photocatalytic or PEC systems for CO2 reduction.44–46 Among them, Homayoni et al. utilized a continuous flow PEC reactor with microchannels showing an interesting shift of products from methanol to longer chain carbon-based products. Therefore, this has already highlighted the importance of reactor design to the complex PEC CO2 conversion process, which has a lot of similarities with both photocatalytic and electrocatalytic CO2 conversion routes. In this study, a sandwich-type planar microfluidic PEC reactor was designed and fabricated consisting of a photoelectrode, Pt coated on FTO (counter electrode), laser cut PMMA parts and Surlyn gaskets (PECR2) without any separator between the electrodes. Although ion-conducting separators or membranes are critical components in electrochemical and PEC cells, they add substantial cost, increase the complexity of reactor design, increase the ionic resistance and are vulnerable to degradation effects.47 Therefore, both PECR1 and PECR2 were designed and fabricated without an ion-conducting membrane.

Fig. 5a shows the total photogenerated products as a function of photoelectrosynthesis time using as-prepared photocathodes of 3 cm2 in PECR1. CuO, Cu2O and composite CuO/Cu2O photoelectrodes converted CO2 to formate and according to eqn (2) their STF efficiency after 12 h was 0.10, 0.04 and 0.14%, respectively. However, in the case of the bilayer α-Fe2O3/CuO photoelectrode, methanol was also obtained in addition to formate, boosting the STF efficiency to 0.2%. Nonetheless, the presence of iron oxide can generate a synergistic effect between Cu and Fe atoms that can shift CO2 reduction products to higher energy density chemicals. In addition, all curves did not illustrate a linear increase vs. photoelectrosynthesis time because back reactions took place simultaneously, such as methanol and formate oxidation on the dark anode.
 Fig. 5  (a) Product concentration in 0.2 M NaHCO3 electrolyte as function of photoelectrosynthesis time for CuO, Cu2O, CuO/Cu2O and α-Fe2O3/CuO photoelectrodes used in PECR1, and (b) product concentration in 0.2 M NaHCO3 electrolyte as a function of flow rate in PECR2 for CuO, Cu2O, CuO/Cu2O and α-Fe2O3/CuO photoelectrodes after 1 h of PEC CO2 reduction experiment. In all cases photoelectrodes were directly wired with counter electrodes while not biased. 
The absence of a separator between the two electrodes allowed product crossover. In addition to liquid crossover (formate and methanol), gas crossover was observed because oxygen evolved out of the liquid electrolyte due to the water oxidation reaction that took place on the dark anode electrodes. The formation of oxygen bubbles is a deleterious effect as it reduces the active electrochemical area of the electrodes and enhances product mixing.48 One way to minimize this effect was the utilization of a continuous flow reactor instead of a batch reactor. Membraneless continuous flow cells can reduce the ionic resistance due to the greater ion-mobility in liquid electrolyte solutions.48 Flow reactors can also significantly reduce the cost and improve the stability of PEC systems bringing them a step closer to an economically viable industrial application. For these reasons, the performance of the as-fabricated microfluidic reactor (PECR2) was also evaluated.
As illustrated in Fig. 5b, in all cases a flow rate of 0.08 mL min−1 was optimal. Initially, an increase in flow rate led to an enhancement of CO2 conversion into methanol and formate but when the flow rate increased higher than 0.08 ml min−1, the efficiency of the system decreased. This effect was associated with the efficient reactant supply and residence time. A longer residence time means that dissolved CO2 in the electrolyte remains in contact with the photoelectrode for sufficient time to complete the desired reaction but simultaneously the products in contact with the illuminated semiconducting material or Pt can be re-oxidized. Another plausible limiting factor in the efficiency of PEC CO2 reduction at low flow rates is the formation of oxygen bubbles in the microchamber of PECR2. Oxygen bubbles that significantly decrease the efficiency of the cell were observed in flow rates lower than 0.01 mL min−1 due to small fluidic drag force while such bubbles were not observed at flow rates higher than 0.02 mL min−1 showing stable operation. In other words, as the flow rate increased the drag force became larger decreasing the size of the bubbles. On the other hand, at high flow rates the diffusion of the products across the electrodes is ruling the CO2 reduction process. Another difference between PECR1 and PECR2 is that in batch reactors the large inter-electrode distance results in large current gradients, while in continuous flow microreactors with a small distance between electrodes this disadvantageous effect can be minimized.49 In addition, high surface-area-to-volume ratio of both photocatalysts and electrocatalysts improved the mass transfer and decreased the reaction time.46 Therefore, the optimal α-Fe2O3/CuO photoelectrode achieved the highest overall STF efficiency of 0.48% after 1 h with 0.08 mL min−1 continuous flow rate in microfluidic reactor with close spacing of 160 μm. Although the highest STF efficiency of 0.48% in this study is low, it is among the highest recorded in such PEC CO2 reduction systems9 while the best STF efficiency reported so far is 1%.50 Overall, the low STF efficiency that was observed in all cases can also be attributed to low solubility of CO2 in water-based electrolytes (0.034 M) at standard pressures.45,51 The limitation of CO2 solubility in water sets a maximum limit of catalytic current density and therefore STF efficiency for PEC CO2 reduction.

Fig. 5b illustrated that utilization of PECR2 led to production of higher concentrations of formate and methanol and enhanced percentage of methanol formation in the case of α-Fe2O3/CuO photoelectrodes. Thus, the continuous flow microfluidic PEC reactor promoted the formation of methanol which has significantly higher energy density than formate. A possible chemical route for CO2 conversion into methanol is that methanol formation commenced after formate is already formed. An indication for this scenario is that the product distribution changed as a function of irradiation time. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, the product distribution shifted away from formate toward methanol for photoelectrosynthesis times longer than 2 h. Methanol formation is enhanced in PECR2 (Fig. 5b) due to the high surface-area-to-volume ratio of both photocatalyst and electrocatalyst and the small inter-electrode distance that increase the interaction of the generated products.
Conclusions
In this work, an electrodeposition method was employed to synthesize CuO-based photoelectrodes for PEC CO2 conversion into liquid fuels. Hydrothermal deposition of a hematite thin layer prior to CuO electrodeposition significantly increased the PEC activity of the electrodes due to a higher surface area and formation of a p–n junction between the two layers. Therefore, coupling α-Fe2O3 nanorods with CuO considerably enhanced the PEC CO2 reduction efficiency and it seems a promising heterojunction for artificial solar fuel generation. In addition, a continuous flow microfluidic PEC cell was developed for PEC CO2 reduction experiments showing the ability to convert CO2 into formate and methanol. Both products were measured to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the system. It was found that the optimal flow rate was 0.08 ml min−1 and the α-Fe2O3/CuO under optimal conditions achieved an STF efficiency of 0.48%. Finally, it was proven that fabrication of a continuous flow reactor from low-cost materials can offer the ability to investigate the potential benefits of microfluidics in PEC CO2 reduction using existing technology of electrochemical and PEC cells.
