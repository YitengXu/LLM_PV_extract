    , Accepted 20th April 2014First published on 22nd April 2014AbstractSolution-processable D–A conjugated polymers are proving particularly promising in bulk heterojunction solar cells. Among these, P(BDT–DTBT) and their derivatives with benzodithiophene (BDT) as the donor unit and benzothiadiazole (DTBT) as the acceptor unit are the most commonly studied conjugated polymers due to their excellent photovoltaic properties. There have been a lot of reports recently on the design and structural organization of P(BDT–DTBT) for solar cells, and it has been demonstrated that one of the critical issues for achieving high performance is the rational molecular design of P(BDT–DTBT) polymers. In this review, we focus on the various structural modifications and photovoltaic properties of the resulting P(BDT–DTBT) polymers. We hope that this review will give some inspirations for high-performance P(BDT–DTBT) polymers and be an important guideline for the design of photovoltaic conjugated polymers.Chen GaoChen Gao graduated from the Beijing University of Chemical Technology, receiving his Bachelor and Master degrees in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

Introduction
In the past decade, bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their many advantages, such as easy fabrication, low cost, light weight and flexibility. Significant progress has been made in this field. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single junction PSC devices have surpassed 8%,1–9 and the PCE of tandem PSC devices has broken 10%10 so far. Nowadays, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are almost ready for commercialization; however, efforts are still needed to lower the cost further, for example by minimizing the synthetic steps,11 and increase the PCEs. Rational design on the polymers as donor materials in the active layer of PSCs is the most effective way to pursue a higher PCE. There are four key points for designing ideal donor polymers: (1) a suitable band gap for a wide and strong absorption spectrum in the visible and near-infrared region; (2) a low-lying HOMO level in order to get a high open-circuit voltage; (3) a coplanar structure and good crystalline properties to enhance the charge transport efficiency and to increase the fill factor (FF) of the devices; and (4) good solubility and high molecular weight.
The donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating structure has been proved to be an effective way to fulfil these four key points. Among the various D–A conjugated polymer building blocks, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as the donor unit and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) as the acceptor unit have been widely used and demonstrated to be excellent polymer architectures for high-performance PSCs. The BDT unit has a symmetric and planar conjugated structure, which can easily realize ordered π–π stacking and facilitate high charge transport ability. Furthermore, the BDT core provides two positions on the central benzene core for attaching different substitutes to ensure good solubility and tune the energy level of the polymers. Since Hou and co-workers12 first reported the synthesis and photovoltaic properties of BDT, a series of copolymers based on the BDT donor unit and different acceptor ones, such as thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT),13–17 thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD),18–20 diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),21 bithiazole,22 quinoxaline,23 and isoindigo,24etc., have been designed.
On the other hand, benzothiadiazole (BT) is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing moieties used widely in PSCs due to its easy preparation, excellent stability and electro-optical characteristics together with its ability to adopt a quinoid structure. By combining BT with various donor units, like carbazole,25–28 2,7-silafluorene (SiF),29 cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT),30–33 dithienosilole (DTS),34 and indacenodithiophene (IDT),35etc., numerous kinds of BT-based D–A copolymers have been developed.
As mentioned above, BDT and BT are the most widely used conjugated moieties, hence the D–A conjugated copolymers, namely P(BDT–DTBT), based on BDT derivatives as the donor unit and BT derivatives as the acceptor unit (in DTBT, two thiophene moieties were flanked into the benzene ring of BT as a π-bridge for reducing steric hindrance and tuning the electronic properties) can be ideal donor materials for high-performance PSCs. Furthermore, PBDT–DTBT is a kind of “weak donor–strong acceptor” polymer:36,37 the “weak donor” BDT helps maintain a low HOMO level and “strong acceptor” DTBT would reduce the band gap of the polymer. During the last few years, there have been a lot of works based on this kind of polymer, and this review will focus on summarizing these works. Although there have been some reviews38,39 on the BDT-based or BT-based polymers, here our special attention is paid to the various structural modification strategies, including heteroatom substitution on donor or acceptor units, introduction of two-dimensional conjugated side chains, fluorine substitution and π-bridge choice, and the interplay between molecular structure and device efficiency parameters. We hope this review will assist broad masses of readers to better understand the relationship between their structure and performance (Scheme 1).

Heteroatom substitution on donor or acceptor units
Replacing the heteroatom of donor or acceptor units by other chalcogen atoms is an effective strategy to optimize the photo-physical properties, and hence understand the structure–property relationships of D–A polymers. Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF) was firstly synthesized by Hou and co-workers.40 The five-membered ring of furan shows weaker steric hindrance to adjacent units compared with thiophene, due to the smaller diameter of the oxygen atom. Consequently, BDF-based polymers demonstrate a coplanar structure and well-conjugated backbone, which promote the high charge mobility and narrow energy band gap. Polymer 1 (PBDFDTBT) (Scheme 2 and Table 1) containing BDF and DTBT was synthesized by Hou's group. 1 showed a low band gap of 1.60 eV and a high PCE of 5.0%. Zou and co-workers41 synthesized three BDF-based D–A copolymers: 2a (PBDFDODTBT), 2b (PBDFDTBTz) and 2c (PBDFDTBO). They found that BDF-based polymers showed an order of magnitude higher hole mobility compared with the corresponding BDT-based polymers. 2a gave the highest PCE of 4.5% among the three polymers. Li and co-workers42 designed and synthesized four 2D-conjugated copolymers, 3a (PBDTT–BT), 3b (PBDTF–BT), 3c (PBDFT–BT) and 3d (PBDFF–BT), based on the BDT or BDF unit as donor and BT as the acceptor. The copolymers based on BDF exhibited a lower band gap and broader absorption spectrum but a higher HOMO energy level, owning to the face that the BDF-based copolymers possess better planar structures and better conjugated backbones than do the BDT-based copolymers. Polymer 3c based on the BDF unit with thiophene conjugated side chains showed the best PCE of 4.42%. Zou and co-workers43 designed and synthesized D–A copolymers, 4a (PBDFFBT) and 4b (PBDTFBT), containing BDF or BDT unit as donors and the monofluorinated BT unit as acceptor. Polymer 4a and 4b demonstrated high hole mobilities of 1.83 × 10−2 and 4.98 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 as measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method, and promising PCEs of 3.3 and 4.0%.

Benzooxadiazole (BO) shows a lower-lying oxidation potential than BT does, because of the stronger electronegativity of the oxygen atom than that of the sulfur atom. Introducing the BO unit to the D–A copolymers is an effective way to reduce the HOMO level and increase the value of the open-circuit voltage, Voc. Wei's group44 synthesized a conjugated polymer 5 (PBDTBO) comprising BDT and BO units. The polymer showed a low HOMO level of −5.27 eV. The PSC device based on polymer 5 exhibited a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 10.4 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 5.7%. Benzotriazole (BTz) is another kind of BT analogue (replacing the sulfur atom with a nitrogen atom). Although the electron-accepting capability of the BTz unit is weaker than BT, it is easy to modify the N–H bond of BTz-based polymers for a better solubility. Li and co-workers45 designed and synthesized polymer 6 (PBDTDTBTz) comprising BDT and BTz units. The PSC device based on this polymer gave a relatively low PCE of 1.7%, because of the wide optical band gap, high HOMO level and poor charge transporting property. Zou and co-workers46 synthesized three new D–A copolymers, 7a (PBDTTDTBO), 7b (PBDTTDTBT) and 7c (PBDTTDTBTz), based on 2D-conjugated BDTT as the donor and DTBO, DTBT or DTBTz as the acceptor. All the copolymers showed high field effect hole mobilities up to the order of 10−2, and their blends with PC70BM exhibited mobilities as high as 10−1 order by the SCLC method. 7c gave the lowest PCE of 3.1%, mainly due to high HOMO level and relatively wide band gap. The device based on 7a showed a high PCE of 5.9% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 11.45 mA cm−2 and an FF of 61%, due to the deep HOMO level and high charge transporting ability.
Replacing S by Se in aromatic rings in conjugated polymers tends to lower the band gap and red-shift the absorption spectrum, because the Se atom is much larger in size and less electronegative compared with the S atom. Furthermore, the interchain Se⋯Se interactions could improve the charge mobility of the polymers.47–49 Hashimoto and the co-workers50 designed an electron-deficient building block benzoselenadiazole (BSe). The BSe-based D–A copolymer 8a (PBDT–DTBSe) was synthesized and the BT-based analogue 8b (PBDT–DTBT) was also synthesized for comparison. 8a exhibited a higher field effect hole mobility of 5.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a lower band gap of 1.55 eV, compared with 8b. The device based on 8a gave a high PCE of 5.18% when blended with the additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), which was slightly higher than that of the BT-based analogue (5.01%). Chen and co-workers51 introduced a fluorine atom on BSe unit in order to get a higher Voc of the BSe-based PSC device. Polymer 9 (PBDT–FBSe) showed a PCE of 5.00%, with a Voc of 0.78 V, much higher than the 0.6 V of 8a. Li's group52 synthesized two fluorinated BT- and BSe-based D–A copolymers 10a (PBDTBT) and 10b (PBDTBSe). The BSe-based polymer showed an obviously red-shifted UV-vis absorption and a higher charge transporting ability compared with the BT-based analogue. By a series of optimizations, the device based on 10b gave a PCE of 2.2%, much lower than the 5.06% of 10a, mainly due to the poorer morphology of the active layer.
You's group53 replaced the benzene in the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) unit with pyridine to get a more electron-deficient acceptor unit, thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (PyT). The PyT-based D–A copolymer 11 (PBDT–DTPyT) showed a narrow band gap of 1.51 eV. The device based on 11 gave a PCE of 6.32%, with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 12.78 mA cm−2 and an FF of 58.5%. Ma and co-workers54 synthesized two D–A polymers 12a and 12b, based on PyT as acceptor and BDTT as donor with different alkyl chains. The two polymers showed low band gaps of 1.56 and 1.53 eV. High PCEs of 4.84 and 5.11% were obtained for an inverted PSC device, higher than the PCE of the counterpart BDT–DTBT-based polymers.
Introduction of two-dimensional conjugated side chains
Rational design on the two-dimensional conjugated side chain of the D–A conjugated polymer is an effective way to tune different properties,55–57 such as thermal stabilities, band gaps, HOMO and LUMO energy levels, hole mobilities, and provide a larger conjugated area which is beneficial for enhancing the intermolecular π–π interactions and obtain higher photovoltaic performances. Hou and co-workers58 designed and synthesized thiophene-substituted BDT, 5-alkylthiophene-2-yl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene (BDTT). The polymer based on BDTT and DTBT, 13 (PBDTTBT) (Scheme 3 and Table 2), showed broad absorption bands covering 300–700 nm and a low HOMO level of −5.31 eV. The device based on 13 gave a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 10.7 mA cm−2, an FF of 57.5% and a PCE of 5.66%.

Hou's group59 designed a new conjugated polymer 14 (PBDTP–DTBT) copolymerized with alkylphenyl-substituted BDT (BDTP) and DTBT units. 14 showed a similar Eoptg of 1.7 eV and a deeper HOMO level of −5.35 eV compared with the alkoxyl side chain analogue. The device based on 14:PC70BM (1:1.5) showed a Voc of 0.922 V, a Jsc of 11.46 mA cm−2, an FF of 44.60% and a PCE of 5.09%. When the device was processed with 0.5% DIO, the FF and PCE remarkably increased to 70.9 and 8.07%, respectively. The introduction of the additives effectively enhanced the crystallinity of the polymer and induced the formation of a multi-length scale morphology. Zou's group60 synthesized two alkoxylphenyl-substituted BDT-based polymers, 15a (PBDTPODTBO) and 15b (PBDTPO–DTBT). The two polymers exhibited deep HOMO levels of −5.56 and −5.46 eV and surprisingly high hole mobilities of 2.2 × 10−1 and 3.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (measured by the SCLC method), due to the strong π–π stacking interactions of the two-dimensional conjugated polymers. The 15a:PC70BM (1:1.5) blend showed a high PCE of 6.2%, with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 11 mA cm−2 and an FF of 64%. Zou and co-workers61 further combined the alkoxyphenyl-substituted BDT with monofluorinated BT units, and the resulting D–A copolymer (16, PBDTPO–FBT) exhibited a narrow optical band gap of 1.53 eV and a deep HOMO level of −5.43 eV. The unsatisfactory PCE of 2.70% based on 16:PC70BM with 3% DIO as a solvent additive was mainly ascribed to the low molecular weight of 16 (Mn = 3.4 kDa).
Wei's group62 designed and synthesized a series of D–π–A conjugated polymers consisting of alkoxy-modified benzooxadiazole and BDT with various two-dimensional conjugated alkylthiophene side chains for 17a (PBDTTBO), alkylphenyl for 17b (PBDTPBO) and alkylfuran for 17c (PBDTFBO). With variation of the side chains from thiophene to phenyl then to furan, the HOMO levels of the polymers changed from −5.46, −5.40 to −5.38 eV, respectively, with nearly the same optical band gap. The devices based on 17, blended with PC70BM gave PCEs of 5.9, 4.8 and 3.6%, respectively. A device incorporating 17a and PC70BM (1:2) with 1% 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) used as an additive, exhibited a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 12.8 mA cm−2, an FF of 67%, and a high PCE of 7.4%. The results indicated that the design of different conjugated side chains is an effective way to tune the photovoltaic properties of the 2D conjugated polymers.
Ge's group63 designed and synthesized a series of BDT–DTBO-based D–A copolymers, 18a (PBDT–DFBO), 18b (PBDTT–DFBO) and 18c (PBDTF–DFBO), with furan as a π-bridge and various side groups. When the alkoxy side chains were replaced by alkylfuranyl or alkylthienyl side chains, the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymers were shifted to lower energy levels, because furan and thiophene demonstrate a weaker electron-donating ability than does alkoxy. 18a, b and c gave PCEs of 5.9, 5.0 and 7.0%, respectively, after polar solvent (methanol or ethanol) treatment. This result demonstrated that the energy levels, charge transport ability, and photovoltaic properties could be tuned by side chain engineering and solvent treatment.
Shen and co-workers64,65 introduced the DTBT moiety into side chains as an electron-deficient unit via vinylene groups. A series of new D–A copolymers based on BDT and thiophene with DTBT as conjugated side chains were designed and synthesized. 19 (PTG1) demonstrated a deep HOMO level of −5.56 eV and a wide optical band gap of 2.03 eV. The PSC device based on 19 with 3% DIO as an additive and optimization of the active layer thickness gave a PCE of 4.32% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 10.59 mA cm−2 and an FF of 49%. For further improving the photovoltaic performance of 19, the D–A copolymer 20 (PBDT–TBTF) comprising BDT and thiophene backbone with a fluorinated-BT conjugated side chain was designed. 20 showed an enhanced absorption coefficient and low-lying HOMO level. The PCE of the device based on 20 was up to 6.21% by a methanol treatment optimization. These results exhibited that using DTBT as conjugated side chains was an effective strategy to tune the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers and achieve high-performance solar cells.
Fluorine substitution
Fluorine atom is the most electron-withdrawing substituent and the smallest electron-withdrawing group. Introduction of F into the conjugated backbone would lower both the LUMO and HOMO levels of the conjugated polymers, without causing much steric hindrance, which is beneficial to increase the Voc and improve the environmental stability (a low HOMO level reduces the potential for oxidation and improves the stability against photooxidation).
The donor–acceptor conjugated polymer 21a (PBnDT–DTffBT) (Scheme 4 and Table 3) which contains 5,6-difluoro-4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene was first reported by You's group66 and the non-fluorinated analogue 21b (PBnDT–DTBT) was also synthesized for comparison. Both the HOMO and LUMO levels of 21a were decreased due to fluorine substituents compared to 21b. The device based on 21a and PC60BM showed a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 12.9 mA cm−2, an FF of 61% and a high PCE of 7.2%. At the same time, Li and co-workers67 designed and synthesized nearly the same electron-deficient building block, difluorobenzothiadiazole. Fluorinated polymer 22 showed lower energy levels, a higher melting point and reduced solubility. The device from 22 with PC70BM at a 1:1 weight ratio gave a result with a Voc of 0.69 V, a Jsc of 8.89 mA cm−2 and an improved FF of 55.4%. The PCE reached 3.4% which was much lower than the PCE of 21a, perhaps due to the different alkyl chain and device optimization. For further understanding of the impact of fluorine, You's group68 designed fluorinated polymer PBnDT–DTffBT (21a), non-fluorinated analogue PBnDT–DTBT (21b) and monofluorinated analogue PBnDT–DTfBT (21c). They found that adding fluorine substituents to the conjugated backbones could improve all three key device parameters (Voc, Jsc, and FF) of polymer-based bulk heterojunctions. The increase of Voc was ascribed to the decreased HOMO level, and the improvement of Jsc and FF could be attributed to suppressed charge recombination and better device morphology.

Peng and co-workers69 compared two polymers, 23a (PBDT–OBT) and 23b (PBDT–FBT), based on BDTT and BT moieties. The BT units were modified with electron-rich alkyloxy and electron-deficient fluorine substituents. The devices based on 23a and 23b showed high PCEs of 5.64 and 6.21%. Wu's group70 designed D–A conjugated polymer 24a (PTBDTff–DTBT) which combined BDTT and fluorinated ffDTBT. The non-fluorinated counterpart 24b (PTBDTDTBT) was also synthesized for comparison. The device based on 24a:PC60BM gave a PCE of 4.8%, much higher than the 1.9% of 24b. Chen and co-workers71 designed and synthesized three fluorinated BT-based conjugated copolymers 25a (PBDTTEH–DTHBTff), 25b (PBDTTEH–DTEHBTff) and 25c (PBDTHDO–DTHBTff) which differed in substituents on the BDT units and alkyl chains on the thiophene π-bridge. PCEs of 4.46, 6.20, and 8.30% were obtained from the PSC devices based on 25a, 25b and 25c, respectively. The PCE of 8.30% for 25c is the highest value among the reported traditional single-junction polymer solar cells without any additives or post treatments.
Inspired by the good result of 21a, You and co-workers72 designed and synthesized the fluorinated benzotriazole unit. For the weaker electron-withdrawing ability of BTz than the BT unit, the polymers based on benzotriazole 26a (PBnDT–HTAZ) and fluorinated benzotriazole 26b (PBnDT–FTAZ) demonstrated medium band gaps (∼2.0 eV). The device based on 26b and PC60BM showed a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 12.45 mA cm−2, an FF of 72.2% and a PCE of 7.1% with an active layer thickness of 250 nm. It is worth noting that the PCE remained above 6% even with an active layer thickness of 1 μm. This result means that 26b is a promising polymer donor material for low-cost, large-area roll-to-roll processing.73 Li's group74 designed a kind of conjugated side-chain-isolated D–A copolymers, 27a (PBDT–HBTA) and 27b (PBDT–FBTA), based on the donor unit of 2D conjugated BDTT and the acceptor unit of BTz without or with fluorine substitution. The PSC based on 27b:PC70BM (1:2, w/w) with 5% DIO additive displayed a PCE of 6.0% with a Jsc of 11.9 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.75 V and an FF of 67.2%.
Peng's group75 designed and synthesized two conjugated copolymers, 28a (PBDTFBZO) and 28b (PBDTFBZS), comprising dialkylthiol-substituted BDT as donor and monofluorinated BTz unit as acceptor. The two polymers showed low-lying HOMO energy levels for the dialkylthiol side chain and F atom. The PSC device based on 28b exhibited extremely high PCE of 7.74% with a high Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 12.36 mA cm−2 and an FF of 71.2%. Notably, the tandem devices based on 28b and a DPP-based copolymer exhibited high PCE of up to 9.40%.
π-Bridge
π-Bridges play an important role in D–π–A conjugated polymers, which affect the optical properties, energy levels, solubility, molecular architectures, hole mobilities and device performances of the polymers. Wang and co-workers76,77 designed and synthesized a series of polymers based on the BDT donor unit and BT acceptor unit with different π-bridges (furan for 29a (PBDT–F–BT), thiophene for 29b (PBDT–T–BT) and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene for 29c (PBDT–TT–BT) (Scheme 5 and Table 4)). Band gaps of 29a, to b to c were tuned from 1.96 to 1.82 to 1.78 eV with HOMO levels up-shifted from 5.44 to 5.35 to 5.21 eV, respectively, because of the increasing electron-donating ability of furan, thiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT). 29a with the furan π-bridge showed a high Voc of 0.94 V due to the low-lying HOMO level. Although having a relatively low Voc, 29c with the TT π-bridge exhibited the highest Jsc, FF and PCE, ascribed to its low band gap, higher extinction coefficient and straight linear molecular architecture. The PSC device based on 29c showed a PCE of 4.93%, much higher than the 2.81% of 29a and 3.72% of 29b.

The relatively low Voc of 29c prevents the polymer based on the TT π-bridge from reaching a higher PCE. Wang and co-workers78 changed the BT moiety for the BO moiety as the acceptor unit of the TT-bridged polymer. The stronger electronegativity of the oxygen atom in the BO unit helps 30 (PBDT–TT–BO) to achieve a lower HOMO level of −5.31 eV compared with the −5.21 eV of 29c. The inverted device blended with 30 and PC70BM gave a relatively high Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 13.87 mA cm−2, an FF of 66.6% and an impressive PCE of 7.05%. Furthermore, Wang and co-workers79 designed two new polymers containing the BDT donor unit and a BT or fluorinated BT acceptor unit with the TT π-bridge. The non-fluorinated polymer 31a (PBDT–TT–HBT) and fluorinated polymer 31b (PBDT–TT–HBT) demonstrated PCEs of 4.37 and 3.56%, with Voc values of 0.72 and 0.81 eV, respectively. The relatively low PCE of 31b was mainly ascribed to the undesirable solubility and poor device morphology.
Hou and co-workers80 designed and synthesized two new copolymers, 32a (PBDTT–DTTBT) and 32b (PBDTT–DTBT), based on 2D-conjugated BDTT and BT units with different π-bridge units of TT or thiophene. The 32a:PC70BM blend film gave a high hole mobility of 1.97 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 measured by the SCLC method, which was two orders of magnitude higher than 32b (1.58 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The PCE of the device based on 32a and PC70BM reached 6.03%, much higher than the 2.34% of 32b. Wei and co-workers81 designed two polymers with different backbone conformations and π-bridges. The thiophene-bridged 33a (PBDT–TBT) showed a zigzagged chain conformation (Z-type), whereas the TT-bridged 33b (PBDT–TTBT) showed a linear chain conformation (L-type). With the conformation changing from Z-type to L-type, the inter-chain π–π stacking was enhanced and 33b blended with PC70BM showed a higher PCE of 6.3% than did 33a (4.9%). This result demonstrated that changing the Z-type polymer to the L-type by using different π-bridges is an effective way to improve the photovoltaic performance.
Outlook and conclusion
The PCE of the solar cells is proportional to the Jsc, Voc and FF of the devices. It is well known that a low-lying HOMO level helps the polymer to gain a high Voc, and the Voc–HOMO relationship scatter graph (Fig. 1) demonstrates this law. Introducing the F atom into the conjugated backbone is an effective way to reduce the HOMO levels. The fluorinated polymers 21a, 23b, 26b, 27b, etc. demonstrate lower HOMO levels and higher Voc compared with the non-fluorinated analogues. Changing BT for a stronger electron-withdrawing unit, like BO or PyT, can also achieve a high Voc. In addition, replacing the alkoxy side chain on BDT with alkylfuranyl, alkylthienyl or alkylphenyl can also achieve the same effects.

The donor polymer should possess a relatively low optical band gap and strong optical absorption to match the solar spectrum in order to enhance the Jsc of the device. From the PCE–Eg relationship scatter graph (Fig. 2), we can see that the low band gap (lower than 1.8 eV) polymers tend to have high PCEs. The BSe- or PyT-based polymers (8a, 9, 11 and 12) exhibited low optical band gaps and high Jsc (higher than 10 mA cm−2). However, the medium and wide band gap polymers have their own advantages in their utilization in tandem solar cells. The tandem devices based on medium band gap polymer 28b gave a high PCE of 9.40%.
 Fig. 2  PCE–Eg relationship graph of polymers 1–33. 
Another requirement for polymer donor materials is a high hole mobility. A high and balanced charge transporting property of the PSC device is beneficial to the FF and Jsc. The influential factors of the PCE are complex, therefore it is hard to judge the direct relation between PCE and hole mobility from the scatter graph (Fig. 3). But when the polymers possess similar backbone structures, the polymer with a higher hole mobility tends to exhibit a better photovoltaic performance.

Molecular weight is an important parameter for conjugated polymers, as typically a higher molecular weight leads to a better photovoltaic performance. Fig. 4 shows that the polymers with a number-average molecular weight (Mn) between 30 and 60 kDa demonstrate a high performance (above 4%); however, the polymers with an Mn of below 10 kDa usually demonstrate a relatively poor result. Very recently, You and co-workers82 designed a set of 26b with different molecular weights, and they found that the polymer 26b with an Mn of 40 kDa gave the highest PCE of 7.3%, whereas the polymer with an Mn of 10 kDa exhibited a poor PCE of only 3.4%. This result agrees with the statistical result.

In this review, we have summarized several aspects of the structure modification rules of PBDTDTBT derivatives. Most polymers were synthesized via the Stille coupling reaction, except for polymer 13 which was synthesized via the Suzuki coupling reaction. It is noteworthy that sometimes the mentioned design rules are not so much perfect in some specific occasions. For example, introducing an F atom to the conjugated polymers brings about a lower HOMO level and higher Voc, but simultaneously reduces the solubility of the polymers, which is unfavorable for device processing. To overcome the negative effect, intelligently collaborating with different rules is an effective way to obtain high PCEs. Taking the TT π-bridge polymers as an example, 29c with a TT π-bridge showed a superior Jsc and FF but an inferior Voc compared with those of the thiophene and furan π-bridge analogues. For further rational modulation of the structure of 29c, the BT moiety was replaced with BO to increase the Voc. The resulting polymer 30 demonstrated a high PCE of 7.05% based on the inverted device.
In summary, the PBDTDTBT derivatives have been demonstrated to be an important class of organic semiconductor materials for PSCs: some types of polymers gave PCEs exceeding 7%, or even 8%, like 14 (8.07%), 17a (7.4%), 18c (7.0%), 21a (7.2%), 25c (8.3%), 28b (7.74%) and 30 (7.05%). Among all these high-performance polymers, 25c demonstrated the highest PCE of 8.3%, which is the highest value for reported traditional single-junction polymer solar cells without any additives or post-treatments. Another noteworthy type of polymer based on a fluorinated benzotriazole (26b and 27b), which exhibited high PCE and FF values, even with an active layer thickness of 1 μm, is shown to be a promising donor material for low-cost, large-area, roll-to-roll solution processing. We believe that the PBDTDTBT derivatives will break the 10% PCE milestone within a limited time.
