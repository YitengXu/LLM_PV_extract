The layer number of graphene can be tuned by changing the gas flow ratio and growth time. The assembled films from the vacuum filtration of the 3D graphene possessed excellent electrical transport properties (Rs ∼ 0.45 Ω/sq, σ ∼ 600 S cm−1), superior to the reported graphene and carbon nanotube films.

1. Introduction

Graphene has recently attracted considerable attention due to its unique characteristics, including exceptional electron/hole carrier mobility,1 high current carrying capability,2 and high mechanical robustness,3etc. Many efforts have been made to apply graphene transparent conducting electrodes in CdTe solar cells,4dye-sensitized solar cells,5 organic photovoltaic cells,6,7 Schottky cells,8,9 with the highest cell efficiency of 4.17%,4 which is still far away from the solar industrial applications. However, it is more applicable to use highly conductive material as back electrodes in the solar cells of CdTe and mc-Si. In our former study, B-doped graphene, prepared by a newly-developed bottom-up method,10 was first used as graphene back electrodes in CdTe solar cells with a high conversion efficiency of 7.86%.11 However, the integrated graphene-based back electrodes still show poor electrical conductivity due to the large resistance from the interfaces of submicron graphene sheets, which may limit the ability of charge collection. Therefore, large-size, highly conductive and continuous graphene sheets are required for high-efficiency CdTe applications.
Up to date, several approaches have been proposed to synthesize large-scale graphene, such as chemical exfoliation of graphite oxide,12,13 liquid ultrasonic exfoliation of bulk graphite,14etc. However, these methods can introduce severe structural defects in graphene sheets during the preparation, and the sizes of graphene sheets obtained are normally small (∼50–500 nm). The assembled graphene films possess very high resistance (10–100 kΩ/sq), which is mainly attributed to the small size of defective graphene sheets and the large inter-sheet contact resistance. Recently, chemical vapour deposition (CVD) has been developed to synthesize large-area graphene on metal substrates.15,16 Although CVD graphene films exhibit extremely high carrier mobility (up to 5100 cm2 V−1s−1) and low sheet resistance (∼100 Ω/sq) and satisfy the requirements of PV applications,6,8,9 the graphene yield is still low due to the limited growth area of the 2D substrate.
In order to overcome the large resistance from structural defects and interfacial contacts of small-size graphene sheets to obtain highly conductive grpahene films, a new growth strategy is proposed to take the advantages of the CVD method to grow graphene on three dimensional (3D) skeletons (porous substrates) with a large surface area, and therefore, the entire network of interconnected graphene sheets can be formed. The 3D graphene networks have been used as the backbone of the polymer composites to significantly enhance the mechanical and electrical properties.17 Therefore, the large-size 3D network of CVD graphene is expected to possess excellent electrical properties and promising photovoltaic applications.
In this study, we have used 3D templates of Ni foams to grow a large-scale graphene network at ambient pressure CVD (APCVD). The high-yield large-size graphene network shows high crystalline quality and excellent electrical conductivity. It has been demonstrated that the 3D graphene is suitable to act as back electrode materials for CdTe solar cells with an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.1%, which is superior to those of reduced graphene oxide (RGO), B-doped graphene and carbon nanotube back electrodes in this type of solar cells.
2. Experimental
2.1 
          Growth of the 3D graphene network

          Ni foams were used to catalyze the graphene growth. Firstly, Ni foams were immersed in a dilute solution of acetic acid for 30 min to remove the oxide layer on their surface, then washed in isopropanol and acetone for 10 min, respectively, and finally rinsed with deionized water and dried for use. Secondly, the Ni foams were heated to 1000 °C in ∼40 min under H2 (200 sccm), then a gas mixture flow of CH4, H2 and Ar was introduced to initiate graphene growth for 10–30 min, and the specific flow rates are listed in Table S1.† After growth, the samples were rapidly cooled to 500 °C at a rate of ∼200 °C min−1 under Ar and H2. The Ni foams covered with graphene were drop-coated with a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) solution (4% in anisole), and then baked at 100 °C for 2 h. The PMMA/graphene/Ni foam structure was obtained after solidification. Then the samples were put into a 5 M HCl solution for 5 h to completely dissolve the Ni foams to obtain the PMMA/graphene. Finally three dimensional graphene networks were obtained after removing PMMA in acetone.
2.2 Preparation of the assembled films
The assembled graphene films were prepared on a cellulose ester membrane through vacuum filtration of 3D graphene suspension. The film thickness was carefully controlled by varying the volume and concentration of suspension.
2.3 Fabrication of CdTe solar cells
An n-type CdS layer was grown on FTO glass (purchased from Solaronix SA, TCO 22–15) using a conventional chemical bath deposition method at 80–85 °C. After cleaning and drying, a CdTe film was deposited by close space sublimation at a substrate temperature of ∼580 °C, and the typical thickness of CdS and CdTe is 100 nm and 7 μm, respectively, as shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.†CdCl2 thermal treatment was carried out at 420 °C. A 5 wt% Cu particle-doped graphene network was used to form back contact of the CdTe cell, and the contact was annealed by placing the device in a tube furnace at 280 °C with a 100 sccm mixture flow of Ar and 5% H2 for 30 min.
2.4 Characterizations and measurements
The graphene morphology was examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6510). HRTEM images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were performed on a JEOL JEM 2100F transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The layer number and quality of graphene were determined with Raman spectroscopy having laser excitation energy of 514 nm in Renishaw inVia Reflex laser Raman. A Dektak 150 step profiler was used to measure the thickness of the graphene films. The sheet resistance and electrical conductivity of the graphene films were obtained by the Van Der Pauw method with an Accent HL5500. The photocurrent density–voltage characteristic was measured using a Keithley Model 2440 source meter under AM 1.5 illumination. A 1000 W Oriel solar simulator was used as a light source and the power of the light was calibrated to one sun light intensity by using a NREL-calibrated Si cell (Oriel 91150).
3. Results and discussion
The Ni foam framework, used as a template for the growth of the graphene network, is a 3D porous structure with tortoiseshell-like morphology, and the pore sizes range from 60 to 130 μm, as shown in Fig. 1a and S2.† The Ni foam consists of polycrystalline Ni grains in the range of 5–20 μm (Fig. S2c and S2d)†. The optimal APCVD was performed at 1000 °C with the CH4:H2:Ar gas rates equal to 2:50:300 in standard cubic centimetre per minute (sccm). The SEM images of the as-grown graphene are illustrated in Fig. 1b and 1c. After the 10 min CVD growth, the entire Ni foam surface was observed to be fully covered by a continuous graphene film, and the graphene with many wrinkles is adhered to the Ni foam surface (Fig. 1b). Many suspended graphene particles bridging these gaps between the interfacial Ni grains were found to form continuous large-size graphene sheets (Fig. 1c), consistent with the graphene growth on metal foils or films.16,18

In order to obtain a free standing graphene network, the graphene-coated Ni foams were drop-coated with a PMMA solution, and then baked at 100 °C for 2 h. The PMMA/graphene/Ni foam structure was obtained after solidification. Notably, the PMMA layer was deposited on the graphene surface as a support to prevent the graphene architecture from collapsing during the Ni foam etching in HCl solution. The PMMA layer was completely removed by hot acetone to yield a graphene network on a desired substrate, which can be confirmed by SEM observation and EDS analysis. The obtained graphene network exhibiting an interconnected 3D network structure is shown in Fig. 1d, and all the graphene sheets (grains) in the graphene network are connected with each other without any breakage. No Ni trace was observed by EDS spectra after acid etching (Fig. S3a & S3b).† The free-standing and flexible graphene network has a very high specific surface area (500–600 m2 g−1) and extremely low density (4.8–5.5 mg cm−3), which is dependent on the porosity and density of the Ni foam template. Obviously, the large grain size and 3D porous structure of Ni foams are crucial to obtain a large-size high-quality graphene network.
The extremely high surface area of Ni foam provides an effective substrate for CVD to produce a large yield of 3D graphene. It is clear that our APCVD method can achieve large-scale graphene growth, and the graphene yield is typically ∼1–4 wt% based on the current type of Ni foams in this lab, which is dependent on the layer number of graphene sheets under different growth conditions. For example, by using 1 g Ni foams, 10 mg 3-layer graphene product was harvested, but the yield of the 10-layer graphene was about 40 mg. It is worth noting that the graphene quantity and the graphene network size can be easily scaled up for future applications by using large Ni foam substrates.
After the graphene networks were ultrasonicated in acetone and filtrated, a large amount of 3D graphene fragments were obtained, as shown in Fig. 1e and its inset. The graphene fragments reveal a curved and crumpled structure with some wrinkles in Fig. 1e, and their typical sizes range from 10 to 50 μm, much larger than chemical exfoliated graphene.12 To investigate the morphology and microstructure of graphene fragments, a single graphene sheet was transferred onto a Cu net surface, as shown in Fig. S4.† The single graphene sheet has a relatively smooth surface with few wrinkles, and shows very good transparency under an electron beam. The wrinkle formation is due not only to the thermal expansion coefficient difference between Ni and graphene,19 but also to the inhomogeneity of the graphene layers. HRTEM images (Fig. 1f) demonstrate that the different graphene layers, including one layer, two layers, and three layers, exist in the obtained graphene network. Clear hexagonal spots with alternating spot intensities were observed in the 1-layer well-crystallized CVD graphene (Fig. S5a).† The ring-like selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) indicates the turbostratic stacking in the 3-layer graphene,20 as shown in Fig. S5b.†
The quality and layer number of the graphene sheets were further confirmed by Raman spectra. No D-band in all the graphene samples was observed, suggesting high graphene quality. Only G band and 2D band were observed for all the graphene sheets in Fig. 2, and the layer number was less than 3 according to the 2D-band index. In the thinnest graphene sheet, a sharp line width of ∼34 cm−1 and a single Lorentzian profile of the 2D-band (2695 cm−1), as shown in Fig. S6,† are two hallmarks of the 1-layer graphene.21 In the other thicker sheets, the 2D-band peak positions of 2700 and 2705 cm−1 represent the existence of 2-layer and 3-layer graphene, respectively.22,23 The disordered layer stacking in the 2-layer and 3-layer graphene is evident with both very high intensity and narrow full-width at half-maximum of the respective 2D band, which is consistent with the SAED pattern. Such stacked graphene sheets were found to possess nearly identical electrical characteristics of 1-layer graphene.15,24

The average number layers of graphene can be tuned by changing the growth conditions. The 3D multilayer (>3) graphene networks were obtained by increasing the flow ratio of CH4:H2 or the growth time. The Raman spectra of the samples grown at different CH4 flow rates (2–20 sccm) are shown in Fig. 3a. The peak position of the 2D-band is clearly up-shifted (Fig. 3b), whereas the intensity ratio of 2D-band to G-band (I2D/IG) decreases with the increase of CH4 flow rate. The layer-number of the corresponding graphene increases from 3 to 10, as shown in Fig. S7.† The 2D band peak positions for the graphene grown at the different H2 flow rates (CH4:Ar = 2:300 sccm) for 10 min are also shown in Fig. 3c, and the 7-layer (H2 = 10 sccm) and 4-layer (30 sccm) graphene were obtained, respectively. When H2 flow rate was further increased to 100 sccm, the few layer (<3 layer) graphene was observed due to the hydrogen gas etching effect.25 Moreover, the longer growth time favours the formation of thicker graphene sheets, as shown in Fig. 3d. More wrinkles can be formed with decreasing H2 gas and increasing growth time (Fig. S8).†

In order to evaluate the electrical characteristics of the graphene networks, the uniform thin films were assembled by vacuum filtrating a graphene network suspension through a cellulose ester membrane, as shown in Fig. 4a. The film thickness can be simply controlled by the amount of graphene suspension. The 10-μm-thick assembled graphene film, as shown in Fig. 4a, has a sheet resistance of 1.6 Ω/sq (electrical conductivity: ∼600 S cm−1). The sheet resistance of the 40-μm-thick graphene film is 0.45 Ω/sq, and the electrical conductivity is 550 S cm−1. The above electrical conductivity (σ) was calculated according to the following equation: σ = 1/(Rsd), where Rs and d are the sheet resistance and thickness of the graphene thin film, respectively. Apparently, the electrical conductivity of the graphene film is dependent not only on the film thickness but also on the assembly process.

(c) Band structure of the graphene-based CdTe solar cell. (d) J–V characteristics of CdTe solar cell with graphene back electrode. 
The electrical conductivities of our graphene films (550–600 S cm−1) are much higher than those of the graphene films from chemical or thermal reduction of graphene oxide (2–200 S cm−1),12,26,27 B-/N-doped graphene films (1.6–3.1 S cm−1)28 and carbon nanotube papers (∼200 S cm−1),29 as listed in Table 1. The higher electrical conductivities of our graphene films are attributed not only to the large size and high crystalline CVD graphene sheets but also to the 3D interconnected graphene. The 3D continuous network structure of the CVD graphene formed by Ni foam template greatly eliminated the contact resistance from grain boundaries to further improve the electrical conductivity. Therefore, the 3D graphene network with unique electrical characteristics may provide various applications in polymer composites, lithium ion batteries, supercapacitors, PV devices, etc.30,31

To further verify graphene network application in PV devices, we have first demonstrated the highly conductive 3-layer graphene networks as the back electrode in a CdTe cell. The solar cell consists of FTO transparent electrode, CdS window layer, CdTe absorber layer and 3D graphene back electrode, as illustrated in Fig. 4b, and the cell band structure is shown in Fig. 4c. The photovoltaic performances of CdTe solar cells were investigated in the light of the AM 1.5 G condition at a calibrated intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 4d. The photovoltaic parameters of the device are listed in Table 1. The fabricated CdTe solar cell (area: 1.0 cm2) with a CVD graphene-based back electrode has a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 20.1 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.78 V, a calculated fill factor (FF) of 58.0% and an overall PCE (η) of 9.1%. Notably, over 20 CdTe cells were fabricated to allow a statistical evaluation of the cells, a relatively narrow distribution of cell efficiencies was observed, and these values remained the same during the measurements in a two-month period, which revealed excellent reproducibility and stability of these devices. The conversion efficiency is much higher than those of CdTe cells with RGO (6.50%),11 B-doped graphene (7.86%)11 and carbon nanotubes (7.0%)32 as back electrodes, as listed in Table 1. The higher efficiency due to the larger Voc and FF indicates that the highly-conductive graphene back electrode improves the hole-collecting ability and reduces the barrier height to form a better back contact with the p-CdTe, compared with the other carbon-based back electrodes. Further optimization is still in progress to improve the cell efficiency.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have developed an APCVD method for large-scale preparation of high-quality 3D graphene on Ni foams. The single- to few-layer graphene sheets were obtained by tuning the flow rates (CH4, H2) and the growth time. The graphene sheets have lateral sizes of 10–50 μm, and the 3D graphene yield was 10–40 mg per gram of Ni foam. The graphene sheets in the graphene network are interconnected into a 3D flexible graphene network with a high specific surface area. The assembled graphene films exhibit outstanding electrical properties, and their conductivities reach up to 550–600 S cm−1. Moreover, the high-quality graphene networks were successfully demonstrated as back electrodes in CdTe solar cells, and the FTO/CdS/CdTe/graphene solar cell has a conversion efficiency of 9.1%. The excellent graphene-based conducting materials may be used as new low-cost back electrodes for PV devices in the future.
