1. Introduction
2,2′:6′,2″-Terpyridines and their structural analogs have gained much interest in recent years as functional templates in the fields of supramolecular and coordination chemistry as well as materials science.1–8 The rich coordination chemistry and generally high binding affinity towards a variety of interesting transition as well as rare earth metal ions, in concert with the resulting redox and photophysical properties, have given rise to diverse metallo-supramolecular architectures and a multitude of potential applications. This is expressed by the enormous number of scientific publications and patents dealing with the synthesis, properties and applications of terpyridine-containing systems (June 2010: almost 5500 hits in SciFinder™). Due to their distinct photophysical, electrochemical, catalytic and magnetic properties, terpyridines and their complexes have been studied regarding a wide range of potential applications covering light-to-electricity conversion,9–29 light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs),30,31 (electro)luminescent systems (e.g. organic light-emitting diodes) or non-linear optical devices.32–41 Moreover, ditopic and dendritic terpyridine ligands may form polymetallic species which can then be utilized as luminescent or electrochemical sensors.42–97 Besides these objectives, their biomedical and pharmaceutical utilization (e.g. as DNA binding or anti-tumor active agents) are currently fast growing fields of research.43,98–109
Furthermore, the catalytic activity of terpyridines and their transition metal complexes has been employed to enhance various (asymmetric) organic transformations:110–112 carbon–carbon single bond formation,113 etherification,114 oxidation of alcohols or ethers,115,116 cyclopropanation,117,118 epoxidation,119 CuI-catalyzed alkyne–azide cycloaddition (CCAAC),120 hydrosilylation121 and controlled radical polymerization,122 only to name a few. Additionally, RuII–terpyridine complexes have been used for the photo-catalytic splitting of water.123–125
Well-designed supramolecular (co)polymer architectures have been realized based on metal–terpyridine connectivities, opening avenues to smart materials with the opportunity of switching the physical and/or chemical properties of materials depending on parameters such as pH value or temperature.1,6,8,126–132 The self-assembly of terpyridine complexes onto nanostructures (e.g. based on gold, silver, CdS, TiO2, carbon nanotubes)133–137 as well as surfaces (e.g. glass, indium tin oxide, gold, graphite)138–146 should also be mentioned in this context.
The diversity of applications related to terpyridines and their metal complexes calls for a high structural variability of the basic 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine subunit. In particular, the terpyridine motifs featuring π-conjugated substituents, commonly attached in the 4′-position, are of increasing interest. The general schematic structures of three widely used types of such terpyridines are depicted in Fig. 1. By far, the majority of conjugated terpyridine-containing systems used today is based on the so-called Kröhnke-motif featuring a functionalized phenyl-ring in the 4′-position of the terpyridine unit (1).7 Their rigid U-shaped counterparts 2 have—mainly due to synthetic limitations—been employed less frequently.147 The Ziessel-type terpyridines 3 where the π-conjugation is extended via ethynyl-based systems have been studied in particular with respect to electron transfer processes.146,148

In this review, the basic synthetic strategies applied in the relevant field of terpyridines are discussed first. In the following the syntheses and applications of π-conjugated mono-, bis-, as well as star-shaped oligoterpyridines are elaborated. For detailed information on mono- and oligo-nuclear terpyridine complexes the reader is referred to the literature.102,149–154 The main part of this work deals with monodisperse bisterpyridines, metallopolymers prepared thereof and their utilization in a range of applications. In this context, materials based on polydisperse π-conjugated terpyridines are also discussed. Non-conjugated polymers and dendritic architectures bearing terpyridine ligands have recently been summarized elsewhere.6,8,126,155,156 Concerning star-shaped architectures as well as metallocycles based on fully-conjugated terpyridines, a complete overview is provided. Finally, surfaces and nanomaterials modified with conjugated terpyridines are briefly discussed.
2. Synthetic concepts in terpyridine chemistry
Before detailing the different types of π-conjugated terpyridine architectures and their incorporation into advanced supramolecular architectures, the basic synthetic concepts towards the key structures 1–3 (Fig. 1) shall be briefly discussed. The first synthesis of 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine (tpy) was reported in 1932 by Morgan and Burstall who isolated tpy in poor yield as a by-product of the oxidative condensation of pyridine with FeIII chloride.157 Since then, a multitude of protocols for the preparation of the basic tpy structure and the introduction of various substituents, suited for further interconversion reactions to other functionalities, have been published.
Various types of cross-coupling reactions, such as the (unselective) Ullmann reactions of 2-halopyridines with 2,6-dihalopyridines or the Pd0-catalyzed Stille as well as Suzuki reactions of appropriate pyridines and 2,2′-bipyridines have widely been utilized for the construction of the tpy core.158 However, these approaches suffer from the poor availability of the required starting materials. The synthesis thereof often involves harsh reaction conditions, many functional groups are not tolerated and the isolated yields are in many cases remarkably poor. Thus, synthetic approaches based on the synthesis of either one, two or all three pyridine rings are preferred and have been the subject of recent reviews and monographs.1–7,126,156,159–161
The by far most common approach for the construction of terpyridines was reported by Kröhnke in 1976.162 In general, derivatives of 2-acetylpyridine and a (hetero)aromatic aldehyde are used in a so-called Kröhnke-type condensation reaction yielding 4′-substituted 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridines 1 (Scheme 1).1–7 Sasaki et al. reported the synthesis of symmetrical terpyridines with a high degree-of-functionalization on the outer pyridine rings using 2,6-diacetylpyridine as starting material.163 A variety of more efficient and environmentally friendlier variants to the original reaction protocol has been developed in recent years, including the utilization of microwave irradiation (in order to decrease the reaction times),164–166 “green solvents” (e.g. poly(ethylene glycol),167,168 ionic liquids,169 solvent-free conditions170–172) or aqueous ammonia (avoiding the excess of ammonium acetate as source for nitrogen).173 Since many functional groups (i.e. R and R′) are tolerated under the reaction conditions, Kröhnke-type terpyridines 1 have become the most frequently used building blocks in the field of π-conjugated terpyridines.
 Scheme 1  Schematic representation of the synthesis of substituted Kröhnke-type terpyridines 1 (top) and rigid U-shaped terpyridines 2 according to Risch and co-workers (bottom). 
Similar to the synthesis of 1, rigid U-shaped terpyridines 2 can be obtained from activated cyclic ketones (i.e. as imine or enamine) and (hetero)aromatic aldehydes or ternary iminium salts according to the groups of Thummel174,175 and Risch,147,176 respectively (Scheme 1). U-shaped terpyridines 2 are less established in the literature mainly due to the limited abundance of the employed cyclic ketones and the rather low tolerance towards the presence of functional groups under the reaction conditions. It is worth mentioning that the protocols for the preparation of either 1 or 2 are exclusively suited for the particular class of terpyridines. A universal condensation method for the synthesis of 1 and 2 has not been reported yet.
The so-called Ziessel-type terpyridines 3 featuring ethynyl-substituents in their 4′-position are prepared via Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions. The parent compound, 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridin-4′(1′H)-one177—obtained by condensation reaction of ethyl 2-picolinate and acetone, followed by cyclization in the presence of ammonium acetate—can be easily functionalized in the 4′-position, leading to 4′-bromo-178 or 4′-triflato-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine179 as the most favoured substrate for subsequent cross-coupling reactions with terminal alkyne derivatives.180–184 This widely used approach is of broad scope, since the isolated yields are usually moderate to good and most functional groups are compatible with the Sonogashira protocol.
Further π-conjugated connectivities, such as the vinyl group,40,87,180,185–187 its isoelectric counterparts188 or N,N-diphenylamino derivatives189 have also been reported, but represent rare examples. 4′-Azido-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine190 was recently utilized as a substrate for the CuI-catalyzed alkyne–azide click (CCAAC) reaction introducing the 1H-[1,2,3]-trizole moiety as a new linker between the terpyridine unit and π-conjugated residues.191,192 However, it was shown by density functional theory (DFT) calculations that the trizole ring resembles a part of the overall π-conjugated system only in very special cases.193
In comparison to complexes of RuII ions with bipyridine-type ligands their terpyridine-based counterparts generally exhibit much less useful photophysical properties.194 The weaker ligand field of tpy leads most notably to lower energy metal-centered (MC) states as compared to complexes of [Ru(bpy)3]2+-type. As a consequence, there is enough energy at room temperature to efficiently populate the MC states from metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) states resulting in fast deactivation of the excited-state via nonradiative processes. Different approaches for the modification of the terpyridine structure were reported in the last 15 years, e.g., increasing the energy gap between the 3MLCT and 3MC states by introducing electron withdrawing and donating substituents.195 The most common method of course is the extension of the π-conjugated system of the ligand increasing the electron delocalization; the Ziessel-type terpyridines 3 turned out to be promising candidates in this respect.196–201
In Kröhnke-type terpyridines (1) the phenyl and the central pyridine rings are twisted on average about 20°–30° due to the unfavorable interaction between the adjacent protons (Fig. 2).202 The nonplanarity between the terpyridyl and the phenyl ring leads to a mismatch between the ground and excited state geometries, thus minimizing the effect of increased delocalization.203 However, it was shown by Presselt et al. by means of Bader's quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM)204 that lateral substituents in the 4-position of the attached phenyl ring, such as vinyl or ethynyl moieties, or coordination to transition metal ions (e.g. ZnII or RuII) can enhance the delocalization expressed by the parameter ellipticity (ε) in the bond critical point (BCP), i.e. the phenyl–pyridine bond.205,206

Fang et al. could significantly reduce the torsion replacing the phenyl-ring by a pyrimidin-2-yl unit (4). The almost flat molecular structure of 4 enabling good electronic conjugation was confirmed by X-ray crystal structure analysis (Fig. 2).203 The coplanar alignment of the rings helped to lower the energy of the π* orbitals due to better π-conjugation. A series of RuII complexes of 4 with improved photophysical properties compared to analog complexes of 1 was synthesized. However, the incorporation of the materials into more advanced structures or the implementation into device architectures has not yet been reported.
Besides this approach, various groups refined the general tpy motif by replacing the central or the outer pyridines by other N-heterocyclic rings. Due to an increase of the energy gap between 3MLCT and 3MC states, the RuII complexes thereof also exhibited improved photophysical behavior, such as room temperature emission.207–212
3. Monodisperse π-conjugated 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridines
In order to evaluate the large variety of π-conjugated terpyridine architectures systematically, a classification into mono- and polydisperse systems has been carried out in this review. Polydisperse π-conjugated terpyridines are obtained utilizing the polymer chemist's toolbox, such as polycondensation or radical polymerization reactions. The remaining majority of π-conjugated terpyridines can then be summarized as monodisperse systems, which will be discussed first.
3.1 Rigid linear and angular π-conjugated 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridines
As already pointed out, the two most important synthetic approaches for the construction of π-conjugated bisterpyridine architectures are (a) the ring assembly via Kröhnke-type condensation methods and (b) the various types of transition metal mediated cross-coupling reactions.1,7 The variants of the Kröhnke-type reaction are an important tool for the synthesis, in particular, of 4′-substituted monoterpyridine derivatives. In recent years, the later method appeared to be of high relevance for the synthesis of complex bisterpyridine structures, due to the efficiency and multiplicity of modern cross-coupling procedures.

3.1.1 π-Conjugated monoterpyridines. 
Kröhnke-type terpyridines bearing functionalities suited for further modification in order to extend the π-conjugated system are widely utilized. In general, the terpyridine building blocks reported by various groups were prepared by applying ring assembly strategies. Table 1 summarizes the most relevant monoterpyridine derivatives 1 currently employed as key substrates in the field of π-conjugated terpyridines. Starting from these building blocks, various types of monoterpyridines with extended π-conjugated systems have been synthesized. Since the main focus of this review is to cover linear and star-shaped terpyridine-based architectures, only a few examples will be briefly highlighted.

Andreiadis et al. reported on the synthesis of π-conjugated terpyridine-based pentadentate ligands 6 (Scheme 2).258 The extension of denticity was realized by thermal cycloaddition of the cyano-substituents of 5 with sodium azide. Ligands 6 were found to efficiently sensitize the luminescence of lanthanide ions in the visible to near-IR regions with high quantum yields (ΦPL). In particular, the ΦPL values for the NdIII complexes of 6 were so far among the highest reported in literature.

Monoterpyridine 7 was prepared from 1h in a solventless Wittig reaction and applied as a surface stabilizing agent to yield 8 to 14 nm sized Ag nanocrystals (NCs, Fig. 3). A pronounced solvent-dependency on the photophysical properties was observed; with increasing solvent polarity the photoluminescence (PL) of the Ag NCs decorated with 7 was remarkably red-shifted.

Golubkov et al. published the synthesis of monoterpyridine 8 featuring a π-conjugated hydrophobic perylene diimide (PDI) chromophore and a hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) chain (Fig. 4).260,261 The self-assembly of 8 in a water/THF mixture into long, ribbon-like fibers by π–π stacking of the PDI moiety could be evidenced by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). Furthermore, 8 was utilized as a template for self-assembly processes, regulated through metal coordination. It was shown that a range of supramolecular nanostructures could be obtained by varying the coordinated metal ion, such as tubular fibers for PdII, vesicles of 26 nm diameter on average for PtII or nanoplatelets with dimensions of 60 × 40 nm for AgI ions, respectively.

The disk-like hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC) unit represents the largest fused aromatic system that has been coupled to terpyridines up to now. The synthesis of 9 involved a Diels–Alder [4+2]-cycloaddition reaction followed by oxidative cyclodehydrogenation, the common general protocol for the synthesis of HBCs (Scheme 3).262 In the case of 10, 4′-ethynyl-terpyridine (3a; R, R′ = H) was coupled to an iodine-functionalized HBC in a Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction. Within the family of HBC derivatives,2649 and 10 are the first examples with pendant polypyridyl ligands and open the avenue for the marriage of the optoelectronic properties of both the “superaromatic” HBC substituent with those of metal ion bisterpyridine complexes.

3.1.2 π-Conjugated linear and angular bisterpyridines. 
Bis(2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine)s via ring assembly strategies. 
The most common methods involving the ring assembly towards bisterpyridines and bis(U-terpyridine)s are the well-known Kröhnke- and Mannich-type condensation reactions, respectively.
Following the general protocol as introduced by Kröhnke,162 an aromatic dialdehyde (A) bearing the designated π-conjugated spacer unit is reacted under basic conditions in a twofold Claisen–Schmidt aldol condensation with a derivative of 2-acetylpyridine (B) yielding a diketone intermediate (C), which is subsequently reacted with a pyridinium salt (D) in a Michael-type bis-addition giving bisterpyridine E (Scheme 4).1,7,263,267
 Scheme 4  Schematic representation of the synthesis of bisterpyridine E utilizing the Kröhnke approach.1,7,263 
The main disadvantage of this method is the occurrence of by-products168 requiring special efforts to purify the desired terpyridines E.1 Thus, the isolated yields for this methodology are often rather low (30 to 40%). Furthermore, the Kröhnke approach has notable restrictions as the limitation to connect the terpyridine subunit with the spacer only via C–C single bonds or the insufficient availability of the required dialdehyde reactants (A). Nevertheless, over the last two decades, the groups of Constable, Kurth, Flamigni, Higuchi, Schubert and, in particular, Newkome have widely applied this reaction sequence for the synthesis of bisterpyridines (11–17, Fig. 5).167,263,265–276
 Fig. 5  Schematic representation of bisterpyridines 11–17 synthesized by ring-assembly methods.167,263,265–276 
Applying environmental friendly reaction conditions, bisterpyridine 11a was synthesized by Winter et al.167 For this purpose, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-300, Mn = 300 g mol−1) as solvent and aqueous ammonia as nitrogen source were used replacing ethanol and NH4OAc. This procedure featured short reaction times, easy purification and rather good yields (51%) in comparison to the conventional Kröhnke methods.
Besides 11a with unsubstituted outer pyridine rings, Kurth and Higuchi also reported on bisterpyridines 11b–d bearing electron-donating (R = Me, OMe) as well as electron-accepting substituents (R = Br) in the 6- and 6″-positions, in order to vary the photophysical properties.263,265 They utilized the general two-step Kröhnke reaction procedure as outlined in Scheme 4 to obtain 11b–d in about 20% overall yield depending on the nature of the peripheral substituents (Table 2).

Bisterpyridine 12 was prepared by Constable et al. in the same way, reacting 2-acetylpyridine with thiophene-2,5-dicarbaldehyde in 30% yield.267 Tanaka and co-workers utilized anthracene-1,8-dicarbaldehyde for the Kröhnke-type synthesis of 13 (38% yield).277,278 Both groups did not report on the photophysical properties of the ditopic ligands, due to subsequent utilization of 12 and 13 for the synthesis of RuII dyads and triads.
Newkome and co-workers showed the successful synthesis of a series of angular bisterpyridines in moderate yields by utilizing the Kröhnke approach (14–16, Fig. 5).268–271,273–275 In 1,3-bis(terpyridin-4′-yl)benzenes 14, bearing different substituents on the phenylene unit, the angle with respect to the two terpyridine moieties was 60° facilitating the subsequent self-assembly with metal ions into hexagonal metallomacrocyclic architectures.268 In order to vary the π-conjugated spacer unit, the same group also introduced a carbazole moiety, leading to pentagonal metallomacrocyclic structures.273 For this purpose, 9H-carbazole was N-alkylated and formylated under Vilsmeier-conditions. The resulting carbazole dialdehyde was reacted under common Kröhnke conditions to yield 15 (34%). Furthermore, Hwang et al. showed the successful synthesis of an angular bisterpyridine (16) bearing a triphenylamine moiety, which has been widely used as hole-transport material in optoelectronics due to the simple synthetic accessibility and stability to oxidation.275 Therefore, commercially available triphenylamine was formylated with POCl3 (so-called Vilsmeier reagent) and subsequently treated with 2-acetylpyridine under basic conditions leading to 16 (34% yield). X-Ray crystal structure analysis of 16 revealed the coplanarity of the terpyridine units and the desired angle (119.69°) for subsequent hexamer formation (Fig. 6). Besides angular bisterpyridines 14–16, also a linear ditopic ligand (17, Table 2) was synthesized by Chan et al.276 applying the solvent-free reaction conditions introduced by Raston and co-workers.170–172

Furthermore, Kimura et al. synthesized an enantiomeric pair of bisterpyridines (18) in (R)- and (S)-conformation derived from enantiomerically pure 1,1′-bi-2-naphthyl-(BINOL) derivatives in a Kröhnke-type reaction (Fig. 7).279 The twisted bridging ligands of C2-symmetry were obtained in about 42% yield. Both enantiomers were utilized for the chirality-induced self-assembly into helical metallopolymers with FeII ions (see Section 5.2.3).

Bis(iminium salts) were introduced by Winter et al. to extend the class of rigid U-shaped terpyridines also to ditopic derivatives, the so-called bis(U-terpyridine)s.280 For this purpose, a multiple-step one-pot Mannich reaction (Scheme 5) was applied.147,176 The appropriate ternary iminium salts F were prepared from the corresponding dialdehydes following Böhme's protocol281 and reacted with four equivalents of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroquinolin-8-one (G) and NH4OAc as nitrogen source yielding bis(U-terpyridine)s 19–26 (Scheme 5). A variety of π-conjugated substituents (e.g. oligophenylene and thiophene units) could be utilized and the ditopic terpyridine derivatives were obtained in moderate to good yields depending on the nature of the iminium salt. Fixing the outer terpyridine rings in an all-cis configuration by annulation, the unfavorable bite angles of the ligands—generally responsible for the weak room temperature emission of RuII–terpyridine complexes—could be significantly improved.149 Besides the symmetric systems (19–26), an unsymmetric bisterpyridine 27 comprising one U-shaped and one 2,2′,6′,2″-terpyridine bridged by a phenyl moiety was recently prepared from iminium salt H by Hummel et al. (Scheme 5).227

Cross-coupling procedures. 
Owing to the limited availability of aromatic dialdehydes required for ring assembly methods and the—in many cases—only moderate overall yields, considerable efforts were made in finding appropriate methodologies for the construction of π-conjugated bisterpyridines based on directed cross-coupling procedures. In particular, the family of Pd0-catalyzed coupling reactions gained considerable interest due to the desired efficiency and simplicity in concert with the controllable functionalization possibilities.1,282–288 In recent years, Suzuki–Miyaura,282 Kumada,283 Negishi,284 Heck,285 Stille286 and Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions,287,288 all based on a Pd0/PdII catalytic cycle, have been applied. By utilizing commercially available compounds (e.g. Pd(OAc)2 or PdCl2) a homogenous catalysis with toleration of a wide range of functional groups is enabled. Depending on the type of cross-coupling reaction, the terpyridine unit is connected to the π-connected backbone either via a single, a double or a triple bond.
C–C single bond formation by cross-coupling methods. 
Though the Stille cross-coupling reaction has gained considerable interest for the synthesis of highly functionalized monoterpyridine derivatives,289–292 it is still only of minor importance for the construction of more advanced π-conjugated bisterpyridines.1,7,289–291,293 Variants of the Kumada and Yamamoto cross-coupling reaction were also utilized in the past for the Ni-catalyzed homo- or heterocoupling of monoterpyridines. In 1990 Constable and Ward reported the synthesis of bis(2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridin-4′-yl) 28, applying a NiII catalyst.177 In continuation of this, the Kumada approach was applied by the groups of Constable266 and Sauvage294,295 in order to gain access also to the homologous bisterpyridine 29a.
However, the by far most relevant cross-coupling procedure for the connection of terpyridines via C–C single bonds to π-connected backbones is the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction.215,216,263,265,296–299 In general, an aromatic dibromide is reacted in this case with the terpyridine moiety bearing a boronic acid (or its ester), or vice versa, using Pd0/PdII catalysts. In 1999, the group of Rehahn reported on the synthesis of bisterpyridine 30a bearing a terphenyl unit with solubilizing n-hexyl side chains as π-conjugated spacer synthesized by Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling (Table 4).300 The power of the method in comparison to conventional ring-assembly methods was demonstrated by the fact that 30a could be obtained in almost quantitative yield after recrystallization.
Taking this into account, the group of Kurth developed an efficient synthesis protocol by employing either a Suzuki-type cross-coupling dimerization or a two-step coupling reaction sequence including a Miyaura boronic ester formation for the synthesis of peripheral symmetrically and asymmetrically substituted bisterpyridine derivatives 29 and 31–36 (Fig. 8, Table 3).215,216,263,265,297,298 For this purpose, different catalysts, bases and solvents were used to elaborate the optimal reaction conditions for this Suzuki-type cross-coupling reaction of aromatic dibromides with 1a in the presence of bis(pinacolato)diboron.216 Linear and angular bisterpyridines with pyridyl (32), oligo(thiophene) (33–35) or oligo(phenylene) bridges (29, 31 and 36) were prepared in this way. Additionally, electron-donating as well as electron-accepting substituents in the 6,6″-position of the terpyridine units were introduced (29, 31 and 35) in order to investigate their impact on the photophysical properties of the bisterpyridine and the corresponding metallopolymers. Depending on the nature of the lateral substituents and the π-conjugated backbone the solubility of the bisterpyridines 29 and 31–36 certainly varied and, therefore, they could be isolated in moderate to good yields after purification.216,263,265,297

The investigation of the UV-vis absorption behavior of bisterpyridines 29g/h, 31a–c, 32 bearing aromatic and N-heteroaromatic spacer units revealed maxima of around 300 nm depending on the peripheral substituents R. The slight blue shift of the absorption maximum for the angular bisterpyridine 31a–c was attributed to a sterical interaction between the two terpyridine units in angular connection preventing planarity.216 Emission maxima were obtained at around 370 nm with quantum yields up to 0.62. Replacing the pyridyl spacer unit by a thiophene one resulted in a significant red-shift of the absorption and emission maxima of around 70 nm indicating a push–pull effect between the electron-rich thiophene bridge and the electron-poor terpyridine unit as equally reported by the group of Schubert.216,219,302,303 This effect was further enhanced by incorporating electron-rich methoxy substituents in the 6- and 6″-positions of the terpyridine units. Generally, electron-donating substituents in these positions led to increased extinction coefficients and quantum yields compared to compounds with electron-accepting substituted as well as unsubstituted bisterpyridines (29a and 31a, Fig. 8 and 9).216,263

Further increase of the conjugation length (35/36) led to an even more pronounced red-shift in absorption and emission. Applying MOPAC/AM1 as well as PM5 calculations, Kurth et al. could attribute the lowest energy absorption bands either to π–π* transitions of the central spacer unit or to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state. Additional investigation of solvent effects on the photophysical properties of the synthesized bisterpyridines emphasized a stabilizing effect of increased solvent polarity on the excited state of these types of bisterpyridines.263
In a recent study Kurth and Higuchi et al. showed the successful incorporation of a triethylene glycol (TEG) substituent in the 6-position of the terpyridine moities.301 In order to prevent steric crowding in the coordination sphere of prospective metallopolymers, only one of the peripheral pyridine ring was functionalized. 6-TEG-4′-(4-bromophenyl)-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine was obtained in a chemoselective nucleophilic substitution from the corresponding 6-bromo derivative and utilized in a one pot Suzuki-type dimerization, yielding 36 together with 29f as a by-product.301 Due to the elongation of the π-conjugated system, 36 showed the most pronounced bathochromic shift in absorption as well as in emission. Furthermore, ligand-centered transitions led to an increase of εmax when the spacer was extended from two to three phenylene units.301
Besides these contributions, the group of Che also applied the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling procedure for the synthesis of bisterpyridines 30b/c and 37.304,305 Linear oligo(phenylene) units with solubilizing alkyloxy- or benzyloxy-chains (30b/c) and a fluorine unit (37) were introduced as central chromophores (Table 4). The bisterpyridines were obtained in rather high yields when compared to the results of Kurth and Rehahn.263,300,308 Absorption maxima ranging from 324 to 354 nm and emission maxima up to 447 nm were reported. Quantum yields were only determined in the solid state, consequently they cannot be compared to the other values reported in solution.

A similar structure to 37 was prepared by Ji et al. by Suzuki cross-coupling. Bisterpyridine 38 featured a direct attachment of the terpyridine units in the 2- and 7-positions of a fluorene group bearing n-octyl side chains in order to improve the solubility.307 Compound 38 exhibited only absorption transitions at 288 and 339 nm corresponding to the overall π-conjugated systems, whereas the individual terpyridine and fluorene bands would be expected well below 300 nm. This finding suggested electronic coupling between the fluorene bridge and the two terpyridine moieties. In addition, steric interaction of the hydrogen atoms in the 1- and 3-positions of the fluorene with the hydrogen atoms of the central pyridine rings in 38 was observed, which disturbed planarity and, thus, decreased the effective π-conjugation length.307
In 2004, Tanaka et al. synthesized bisterpyridine 39 with the terpyridine units connected via a xanthene moiety.296 Suzuki cross-coupling between 2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethyl-xanthene-4,5-diboronic acid and 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridin-4′-yl triflate in a 1∶2 ratio yielded 39 almost quantitatively (90%). The ligand was subsequently used for the synthesis of PtII complexes. Therefore, the photophysical properties of the bisterpyridine itself were not further investigated. The anticipated parallel orientation of the terpyridine moieties was proven by X-ray crystal structure analysis of the corresponding PtII complex (Fig. 10).

Bernhard et al. showed the successful synthesis of an enantiomerically pure chiral bisterpyridine 40 (Fig. 11) presumably by a Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction.309 The chiral terpyridine subunits were prepared by a Kröhnke approach utilizing 2,6-diacetylpyridine and (1S)-(+)- or (1R)-(−)-myrtenal, respectively.310 However, the characterization of the ditopic ligand was not further discussed; the focus was on the utilization of 40 for the synthesis of homoleptic and heteroleptic RuII bis-complexes.
 Fig. 11  Schematic representation of a chiral bisterpyridine 40 synthesized by Bernhard et al.309 
Furthermore, the same group reported on the synthesis of monoterpyridines 41a/b and bisterpyridine 42 featuring a photochromic dithienylethene (DTE) bridge by Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling.311,312 Therefore, the bis(boronic ester) of the bridging unit was reacted with 1a. Such ligands are of particular interest for applications in the fields of controlled electron transfer and luminescence alteration due to their possibility of “switching” the molecule between an open and closed form, simply by irradiation at specific wavelengths (Scheme 6).311 Abruña and co-workers could show that irradiation at 320 nm of a colorless solution of the open form of bisterpyridine (o-42) for a few minutes led to a color change to purple, resulting in a broad absorption band at 570 nm (Fig. 12). This characteristic behavior was ascribed to the more extended π-conjugated system in the closed form (c-42) than in the open state (o-42), with the higher degree of electron delocalization resulting in a red-shift of the longest absorption wavelength band from 340 nm to 570 nm.311–313 On-line 1H NMR spectroscopy experiments could reveal a quantitative and reversible open-to-close conversion.311 The ditopic ligand was used for the preparation of heteroleptic RuII, OsII, FeII and CoII bis-complexes, which could subsequently be cyclized either electrochemically or photochemically.311 The group of Mattay reported in a recent study a similar chromophore with two additional aryl moieties annelated to the thienyl units and a perfluorinated cyclopenteno-bridge.314 This bisterpyridine showed the anticipated photochromic behavior of o-42, undergoing photocyclization under UV-irradiation. Recently, Piao et al. reported on the application of 41c (R = OC12H25) as a fluorescent probe in bioimaging.100 Due to its low cytotoxicity 41c could be utilized as a detector for biological processes, such as the metal ion transmembrane transport.

Complementary to their examples of bisterpyridines synthesized via ring-assembly methods (14–17), the group of Newkome also applied the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling for the synthesis of the angular systems 43 and 44 with angles of around 60° between the terpyridine motifs (Fig. 13).31543 was obtained in moderate yield (32%) from the dimerization of 4′-(3-bromophenyl)-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine in the presence of bis(pinacolato)diboron. To further increase the size of the anticipated metallomacrocycles, an additional phenylene unit was introduced (44) by reacting 1,4-benzenediboronic acid with 4′-(3-bromophenyl)-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine under Suzuki–Miyaura conditions.315 Due to their low solubility in common organic solvents, both ditopic ligands were characterized by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry. Compounds 43 and 44 were subsequently used for the synthesis of trimetallic hexameric macrocycles.
 Fig. 13  Schematic representation of angular bisterpyridines 43 and 44.315 
Moreover, Risch and co-workers synthesized linear and angular rigid bis(U-terpyridine)s 45 as well as their S-shaped counterparts 46 by utilizing the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction (Fig. 14).227,316 However, the photophysical properties of 45 and 46 were not investigated in detail and, thus, could not be compared to those reported for e.g.36a. Additionally, the preparation and characterization of various dinuclear heteroleptic RuII and PtII complexes derived from 45 and 46 were reported.316 Furthermore, the unsymmetrical derivative 47 comprising a rigid S-shaped and a 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine unit was obtained from the reaction of 4-bromophenyl-substituted S-terpyridine and 1e under the same reaction conditions (62%, Fig. 14).227

C–C double bond formation by cross-coupling methods. 
The connection of terpyridine moieties to a π-conjugated spacer unit via C–C double bonds can also be realized applying Pd0/PdII-catalyzed cross-coupling procedures, i.e. the Heck reaction. In this case, a terminal alkene is reacted with an aryl halide, generally resulting in the thermodynamically more stable (E)-alkene.285 However, compared to the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction, only few examples deal with this approach for the preparation of π-conjugated bisterpyridines (48–51).
In addition to the already discussed bisterpyridines 30b/c and 37, the group of Che synthesized bisterpyridine 48 (Table 5) by a Heck cross-coupling procedure.304 Due to the additional double bonds, improved planarization was achieved resulting in a more pronounced bathochromic shift in absorption as well as in emission. Furthermore, 48 exhibited the highest, up to date reported, quantum yields (ΦPL = 0.63) in the solid state of all known bisterpyridines.193,304 The absence of side chains contributed further to the enhanced planarization and, therefore, to a smaller energy band gap.193,219,302,303

Recently, Mikroyannidis and co-workers reported the synthesis of bisterpyridines 49–51 applying the Heck reaction with Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst.28,317 The key building block, 4′-(4-vinylphenyl)-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine (1d), was obtained from 1a in a Stille cross-coupling reaction. The terminal vinyl-group was subsequently used for the PdII-catalyzed Heck cross-coupling reaction with 1a (to yield 49) or the respective π-conjugated spacer units (to yield 50b and 51a). Bisterpyridines 49–51 synthesized by this protocol were obtained in moderate to good yields (46–61%). In accordance with other reported bisterpyridines, the UV-vis spectra of 49–51 were dominated by the characteristic π–π* transitions of the terpyridine moiety (300–330 nm) and the π–π* absorption bands of the overall π-conjugated system between 340 and 420 nm. Within the series, 49 showed the most bathochromically shifted absorption maxima. However, in contrast to this, 51a exhibited the most pronounced red-shift emission, despite bearing planarity disturbing dodecyl side chains. The authors attributed this behavior to the electron-donating character of the side chains. Additionally, fluorene containing ligand (50) showed the highest quantum yield (ΦPL = 0.55) of all reported ligands. 50 and 51a were used as emissive materials in double-layer OLEDs. Devices of the configuration ITO/PEDOT/ligand/Ca/Al were fabricated and the electroluminescence properties were investigated. Turn-on voltages of 8 to 10 V were required and, at a driving voltage of 14 V, a maximum luminance of 63 cd m−2 and a current density of 688 mA cm−2 were obtained for 50.
C–C double bond formation by condensation reactions. 
In addition to the Pd0/PdII mediated cross-coupling procedures, various groups applied the Wittig and Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons (HWE) condensation reactions—both established synthetic tools in π-conjugated polymer chemistry—in order to connect π-conjugated spacer units with the terpyridine moieties via C–C double bonds.318,319 In particular, Schubert and co-workers followed this approach by linking the terpyridine moieties with π-conjugated spacer units, which have been widely used in the field of PPE/PPV-type polymers.
A diverse library of bisterpyridine architectures (50a, 51(c/d)–58) was obtained by HWE condensation in high yields (above 80%, Scheme 7, Table 5). For this purpose, the key building block 1f was combined with aromatic dialdehyde derivatives.219 The high (E)-selectivity of the HWE condensation was proven by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Taking all this into account, the HWE reaction was found to be more efficient for the attachment of π-conjugated spacer units to the terpyridine moiety compared to the Pd0-catalyzed methods. Independent of this, Yuan et al. also reported the synthesis of bisterpyridine 50b by Wittig reaction of 1h (Table 5).305 The investigation of the photophysical properties of 50–58 revealed a distinct red-shift of the absorption maxima together with a strong increase in the molar extinction coefficient with increasing π-conjugation length. The emission maxima of 50–58 covered nearly the whole blue range (444–500 nm) and quantum yields up to 85% were obtained (Table 5). Additionally, the emission data of spin-coated films were compared to those of dilute solutions. Due to strong π–π interaction in the solid state, a red-shift of the emission maxima (∼30 nm) together with a decrease in the quantum yields (∼25%) were observed.

Winter et al. also synthesized aldehyde-functionalized π-conjugated monoterpyridine 59 by Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction of 1c.219,30259 was subsequently utilized for the preparation of the unsymmetrical bisterpyridine 60219 and the isomeric set of bisterpyridines 61 (Scheme 7, Table 5).302 Since p-61 is considered as a building block for photoactive complexes and metallopolymers,320 the ultrafast photoinduced dynamics were investigated by femtosecond time-resolved absorption spectroscopy as well as time-resolved fluorescence and Raman measurements.321,322
Furthermore, the group of Schmehl prepared bisterpyridines 48, 49, 51b and 62 (Table 5).323–326 The authors could show that the utilized Wittig approach starting from 1h was better suited for the synthesis of bisterpyridines when compared to the Heck cross-coupling procedure also reported by Vellis et al.28 The ligands were not characterized further and used for the subsequent preparation of heteroleptic RuII, OsII and ZnII bis-complexes. The (ultrafast) photophysical properties indicated the potential of the complexes to serve as new light-harvesting materials.323–326
Electron-withdrawing groups on the vinylene unit are known to improve the electroluminescence efficiency in poly(phenylene–vinylene)s (PPVs).319 In general, such PPVs can be prepared by Knoevenagel-type polycondensation reactions and many examples are reported. Surprisingly, the application of these reactions in the field of π-conjugated terpyridines is rather rarely investigated up to now. Duprez et al. synthesized an α-cyano PPV end-capped with a terpyridine unit.18 In addition, Schubert and co-workers reported the preparation of cyano-functionalized mono-(63) and bisterpyridines (64 and 65) by microwave-assisted Knoevenagel condensation.240 Monoterpyridines 63 were obtained from aldehyde derivative 59 in high yields by reaction with benzylcyanide and malononitrile (Scheme 8). Accordingly, the reaction of 59 with 2,2′-(1,4-phenylene)diacetonitrile yielded 64. The benzylcyanide-functionalized terpyridine 1i was used for the synthesis of bisterpyridine 65 (Scheme 8). As expected, a pronounced bathochromic shift of both the absorption and emission maxima compared to the corresponding terpyridines without electron-withdrawing CN-substituents was observed (Table 6). However, incorporation of 64–66 into supramolecular architectures was not reported yet.

C–C triple bond formation by cross-coupling methods. 
Besides the previously discussed connection of the chelating terpyridine moiety to the π-conjugated backbone via single and double bonds, realized by Pd0/PdII-mediated cross-coupling procedures or condensation techniques, considerable efforts are currently made to apply triple bonds as a linker. Contrary to the various available double bond formation reactions, only the metal-catalyzed Glaser and, in particular, Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions represent appropriate tools for the connection of the terpyridine unit via a triple bond to the spacer.
With respect to this the groups of Ziessel and Harriman investigated both reactions in detail regarding the directed construction of photoactive molecular wires.178,180–183,199,221,327–336 In an early contribution, the authors synthesized bisterpyridines 66 and 67 applying Pd0-catalyzed methods (Fig. 15).178,327 Both 66a and 67a were obtained from Pd0/CuI-catalyzed Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction of ethynyl-functionalized terpyridines 3a (R = R′ = H) or 1c with 4′-bromo-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine or 1a, respectively. Utilizing CuI/CuII catalysts (i.e. Glaser conditions), dimerization of 3a or 1c was observed yielding bisterpyridines 66b and 67b, respectively. Ligands 66 and 67 could be obtained in almost quantitative yields after purification, except 67b owing to the rather low solubility in organic solvents.

Furthermore, the authors reported the synthesis of a series of bisterpyridines (68–70) containing an additional chelating moiety within the π-conjugated spacer unit (Fig. 15).328 Tritopic ligands 68 and 69 were prepared by Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction of 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridin-4′-yl triflate and the corresponding diethynyl-substituted bipyridine derivatives. Besides that 2,9-dichloro-1,10-phenanthroline was reacted with 3a to yield 70. All ligands were obtained in good yields, characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, as well as infrared (IR) spectroscopy and utilized for the self-assembly into molecular wires. The oligoacetylene spacers could be shown to operate as effective pathways for transporting electronic charges.183,329
In order to further extend this work, the π-conjugated spacer unit was varied by incorporating different oligoaromatic units (i.e. 1,4-phenyl-, naphth-1,4-yl- and anthracen-9,10-yl, 71–73, Fig. 16) between the lateral terpyridines.331 For this purpose, the respective aromatic dibromides were reacted with 3a under Sonogashira cross-coupling conditions. Due to the rather low solubility of this kind of bisterpyridines, 71–73 precipitated during the reaction. The compounds were obtained as yellow to orange solids, which was in accordance with the acquired photophysical data.

As a considerable drawback, increasing the conjugation length of such rigid ligands led to a gradual decrease in solubility. Taking this into account, Khatyr and Ziessel developed a synthetic approach for the design of soluble bisterpyridine ligands 74 without losing the effectiveness of electronic conductivity by an iterative strategy based on Pd0-promoted cross-coupling reactions (Scheme 9).180,181 Intermediates I–N were readily prepared by palladium-mediated coupling procedures, comprising several protection, deprotection and cross-coupling steps. The terminal alkyne and halide derivatives (I–L) were reacted with 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridin-4′-yl triflate or 3a, respectively, using a Pd0-catalyst in the presence of a base in order to gain access to 74a–d. However, the utilization of a catalytic amount of CuI was not reported. Bisterpyridine 74e was obtained from the reaction of trimeric dibromide M with 2 eq. of building block N. Additionally, the oxidative Glaser homocoupling of monoterpyridine N in presence of a CuI-species and oxygen yielded bisterpyridine 75 (Scheme 9). All reported ditopic ligands were obtained up to 80% yield and were characterized by standard procedures.180,181

Electronic communication along the molecular axis of 74 as well as 75 was indicated by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. As anticipated, the lowest energy absorption transition shifted progressively towards higher wavelengths with an increasing number of repeating units (Table 7). Additionally, this behavior mirrored the increasing degree of π-conjugation. Within this series, bisterpyridine 74e showed the most pronounced bathochromic shift (λabs = 440 nm), due to a total of 78 π-electrons contributing to the conjugated system. The same stands for the emission behavior of 74 and 75. An excited triplet state could be excluded by the fact that no change in the steady-state emission occurred for oxygen-degassed solutions of the respective bisterpyridine. The large Stokes shifts (1450 to 2990 cm−1) revealed the charge-transfer characteristics of the excited state (Table 7).180 Further on, 74 and 75 were applied for the preparation of RuII- and RuII/OsII-dyads, in order to study the intramolecular electron and triplet-energy transfer processes along the molecular axis.199,333,334

The same groups also reported the synthesis of an angular bisterpyridine (76, 56% yield, Fig. 17, Table 7) bearing a π-conjugated thiophene unit substituted with a dodecyl chain for solubility reasons.335 In contrast to the previous procedures, here a CuI co-catalyst was applied in the cross-coupling reaction. In order to overcome the intrinsic complexation of the catalysts, larger amounts were used. 76 revealed its longest wavelength absorption band at 380 nm and emission was centered around 400 nm in dilute solutions. The fluorescence band became structured and underwent a blue shift with decreasing solvent polarity. The reported ligand was furthermore used for the synthesis of homometallic dyads (RuII) and heterometallic triads (RuII, ZnII), respectively.335

Finally, Benniston et al. described a series of bisterpyridines 77 connected via a geometrically constrained 4,4′-biphenyl bridge, in order to study how the rate of through-bond electron transfer depends on the torsion angle of the bridging unit (Fig. 17).336 The synthetic route towards 77 involved alkylation of 4,4′-diiodobiphenyl-2,2′-diol with diiodoalkyl or ditosyloxyoligoether linkers, respectively, under basic conditions and subsequent cross-coupling with 3a using standard Sonogashira reaction conditions (33–56% yield). As anticipated, the solubility in organic solvents, such as chloroform or toluene, could be increased with increasing number of repeating units within the alkoxy and oligoether bridge. Besides the terpyridine binding units, also the crown ether macrocycle (77b) was utilized for the coordination of alkali metal ions. The respective complexes were identified by ESI mass spectrometry, revealing a high selectivity of 77b for the complexation of Li+ (n = 2), Na+ (n = 3) and K+ ions (n = 4), respectively.
Related to these contributions, the groups of Lin337–339 and Sun307 synthesized bisterpyridines 78 and 79 with fluorene-based π-conjugated spacer units bearing alkyl-chains or carbazole pendants in the 9-position of the fluorene core (Table 8). In the case of 79, additional phenyl units with electron-donating or -accepting units were incorporated. In all cases, Sonogashira cross-coupling of dibromo-functionalized spacer units with terpyridin-4′-yl triflate was performed to yield 78 in moderate (about 40%) and 79 in high yields (72 to 89%). The photophysical properties of 78 and 79 were investigated in dilute solutions as well as in the solid state. The sterical demanding carbazole unit in the side chain of 78c had no significant impact on the photophysical behavior. In contrast to that, bisterpyridine 79c bearing electron-rich methoxy groups featured a bathochromic shift in absorption of around 30 nm when compared to its electron poorer counterparts (79a/d). This behavior was attributed to charge-transfer (CT) characteristics of the longest wavelength absorption band. 78 as well as 79 exhibited intense violet to blue emission with quantum yields up to 0.29 in dilute solutions. Thin film investigations on 79 revealed similar results for the absorption behavior, but a strong red-shift in emission (about 80 nm) attributed to aggregation of the linear chromophores in the solid state.

Brombosz et al. utilized the Sonogashira cross-coupling procedure for the synthesis of bisterpyridine 80 (Table 8).340 Diiododistyrylbenzene and two equivalents of 3a were reacted under PdII/CuI catalysis to yield 80 in moderate yield (23%). 80 was subsequently utilized for sensing experiments with transition metal ions as well as anions. High sensitivity towards various transition metal ions was observed, e.g. for ZnII ions the emission color was shifted from blue to orange. Furthermore, the ZnII complex of 80 served as an efficient sensor for fluoride ions compared to other halide ions (Fig. 18).

The group of Newkome extended their library of angular bisterpyridines as templates for the construction of metallomacrocycles with examples obtained by the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction (Scheme 10).272,274,342 For this purpose, they synthesized the diethynylbenzene O bearing an electron-donating, -accepting or sterically demanding substituent in the 3-position. O was subsequently reacted with 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridin-4′-yl triflate—unsubstituted or disubstituted with an electron acceptor in the 4,4″-position—to yield angular bisterpyridines 81 in low to moderate yields. Besides this, also the Glaser coupling was applied as an alternative route towards an 60° angled bisterpyridine bearing triple bonds (82, Scheme 10).272 Additionally, 60° angled bisterpyridine ligands 83 were obtained in good yields by cross-coupling 1,4 diiodobenzene or 1,4-bis(dodecyloxy)-2,5-diethynylbenzene with 4′-(3-bromophenyl)-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine or 4′-(3-ethynylphenyl)-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine under Pd0/CuI-catalysis (Scheme 13).315 As already pointed out, these building blocks were used for the synthesis of trimeric and hexameric FeII or RuII macrocycles.272,274,315,342

Furthermore, the group of Baumgartner recently reported the incorporation of dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]phospholes as a conjugated spacer via the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction (84) (Table 8).341 Upon bromination of P-phenyl-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]phosphole simultaneous oxidation of the phosphorus center was observed. This aromatic dibromide was subsequently reacted under Sonogashira conditions with 3a. As a by-product, a monoterpyridine with one unreacted bromo-functionality was observed. Both species were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).
The photophysical properties of 84 (Table 8) were supported by theoretical calculations on the B3LYP/6–31G* level,343,344 predicting a HOMO–LUMO energy gap of 2.87 eV. The influence of the pH value on the photophysical properties was also investigated; addition of acetic acid led only to a negligible bathochromic shift in emission. This behavior was explained by the more electron-withdrawing nature of the dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]phosphole spacer, preventing charge-transfer processes with the electron-poor, protonated terpyridine moieties.341 Schubert and co-workers synthesized the bisterpyridines 85–90 in order to elaborate structure–property relationships between the nature of the overall π-conjugated system and the resulting photophysical properties (Table 8). For this purpose, the length of the conjugated system was varied (85 and 86)306 and the influence of the triple bond as a linker between the conjugated spacer and the terpyridine moieties in comparison to double bonds (see 50a, 57 and 58) was studied for three examples (88–90).
In general, low solubility and poor processability of the metallopolymers is a considerable drawback resulting from the rigid-linear structure and high molar masses. In order to enhance the processability and to improve the solid-state properties of the targeted metallopolymers, rigid π-conjugated bisterpyridines with polycaprolactone (pCL) side groups (92) were reported by Winter et al.345 Hydroxyalkyl-functionalized ditopic ligands 91 (Scheme 11) were prepared by a Pd0-catalyzed Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction in almost quantitative yields. As expected, the photophysical properties of 91 were identical to those reported for 85. Following well-described procedures, macroligands 92 (Scheme 11) were synthesized by SnII-catalyzed bulk polymerization of ε-caprolactone. The molar mass of 92 was estimated by 1H NMR spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and UV-vis titration experiments. Furthermore, the photophysical properties were studied in dilute solutions and in the solid state (i.e. thin spin-coated films on glass slides). A negligible influence of the pCL chains on the photophysical properties was concluded from the results. In order to prove that aggregation is hindered due to the covalent attachment of the polymers, a blend of 91b in a pCL matrix was investigated. A strong aggregation of the π-conjugated system of 91b when blended into a solid pCL matrix was indicated by a bathochromic shift in absorption as well as in emission, in concert with a strong decrease of the quantum yield (ΦPL = 0.11), compared to the covalently bound materials 92a/b (ΦPL ≈ 0.40).345 The self-assembly of 92 with ZnII ions led to metallopolymers overcoming the crucial limitations of processabilitiy and film-forming behavior.

So far, the majority of π-conjugated bisterpyridines reported in literature features spacer units with electron-donating properties. Recently, the group of Schubert reported the synthesis of a series of bisterpyridines with electron-acceptor containing linkages.240,303 A variety of acceptor units, known from the field of π-conjugated polymers (e.g. [2,1,3]benzothiadiazole, terephthalates, thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine, quinoxaline or nitrile-containing systems), was combined with terpyridine moieties (Scheme 12). The acceptor-type spacer units were synthesized in multi-step procedures and reacted with 1c under Pd0-catalyzed Sonogashira cross-coupling conditions (Scheme 12). Bisterpyridines 93–100 were obtained in moderate to good yields after gel filtration using aluminium oxide and subsequent precipitation. Detailed investigations on the steady-state photophysical properties were carried out in order to elaborate the influence of the electron-acceptor spacers on the π-conjugated system (Table 9). Within the series, bisterpyridine 97 exhibited the most pronounced bathochromic shift in absorption and in emission, resulting also in the smallest optical energy band gap.303 This behavior was explained by strong electronic interaction of the lateral electron-rich p-dialkoxy benzene substituents with the electron-poor thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine unit, resulting in an intramolecular charge transfer. Ditopic ligands 93–100 featured blue to red emissions with high quantum yields (ΦPL) in the range of 0.37 to 0.79. These ditopic building blocks were utilized as monomers for the synthesis of ZnII metallo-homopolymers as well as random co-polymers.303
Furthermore, Akkaya and co-workers reported the synthesis of a boradiazaindacene (BODIPY) containing bisterpyridine applying Sonogashira cross-coupling.346 Starting from 3,5-bis(decyloxy)benzaldehyde and 2,4-dimethylpyrrole, the green emitting BODIPY unit was obtained in moderate yields (Scheme 13). After iodination and subsequent cross-coupling with 1c under the usual Sonogashira-conditions, bisterpyridine 101 was obtained in high yields. The longest wavelength absorption band revealed a large bathochromic shift (λabs = 577 nm). 101 shows a bright orange to red emission.

Additionally, Rowan and co-workers described the synthesis of analogous structures to bisterpyridines reported by the group of Ziessel.178,327 In this case, the outer pyridine rings were replaced by 1-methyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl units (102 and 103, Fig. 19).347–350 4-Ethynyl-functionalized 2,6-bis(1-methyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)pyridine (BIP) was reacted with 1,4-diiodo-2,5-bis(octyloxy)benzene under Sonogashira conditions yielding 102 (82%). 103 was obtained by dimerization of 4-ethynyl-BIP in the presence of oxygen under Glaser conditions. The photophysical properties of 102 and 103 are summarized in Table 10.

2,2′:6′,2″-Terpyridines with miscellaneous connectivities. 
Besides the previously discussed ring-assembly and cross-coupling procedures, several alternative synthetic approaches for the connection of the chelating terpyridine units to a π-conjugated backbone have been reported in the literature.
Würthner and co-workers reported already in 2002 on the successful synthesis of bisterpyridines 104 based on the perylene bisimide motif bearing different solubilizing substituents (Table 11).351–353 Condensation of 1j, obtained from reduction of the corresponding nitro compound, with bisanhydrides of perylene tetracarboxylic acid in quinoline and ZnII acetate as catalyst led to the formation of 104. Due to strong interaction with the column material upon chromatography, only moderate to low yields were obtained. The steric demanding substituents on the perylene bisimide core enabled good solubility in polar aprotic organic and aromatic solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane or toluene, and allowed characterization by standard techniques. UV-vis absorption spectra of 104 were dominated by the characteristic transitions of the perylene bisimide chromophore between 500 and 650 nm, whereas at wavelengths below 350 nm both the terpyridine moiety and the perylene bisimide spacer absorbed. Intense red emission with high ΦPL values of around 0.90 was observed.

Moreover, Harriman et al. published a bisterpyridine with a boron dipyrromethene dye as a spacer unit (105, Table 11).354 The chelating terpyridine units were attached to the boron center via terminal triple bonds. 105 was obtained by a low temperature reaction of lithiated 1c with BODIPY. Steady-state absorption as well as time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy revealed absorption and emission maxima of 517 nm and 532 nm, respectively. The rather small Stokes shift (545 cm−1) and the observed quantum yield as well as the excited-singlet state lifetime (ΦPL = 0.72, τS = 6.5 ns) correlated well with previous results on related boron dipyrromethene dyes,355 indicating that the attached terpyridine moieties do not significantly influence the photophysical properties of 105.354 Characteristic terpyridine π–π* transitions were observed at around 280 nm. Changes in solvent polarity had only marginal effects on these values. Bisterpyridine 105 was furthermore utilized for electro-optical investigations in the presence of ZnII ions.
The Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, the so-called ‘click’ reaction,356,357 was utilized by Schubert and co-workers as a reliable synthetic tool, also for the straightforward synthesis of π-conjugated bisterpyridines.192,193 With respect to this, 106 was prepared by the combination of two orthogonally substituted substrates (i.e.1c and 4-azido-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine190) within one click reaction (Scheme 14). Due to the rigid structure and the absence of solubilizing side chains, very low solubility of 106 in common organic solvents was observed. As a consequence, the photophysical properties of bisterpyridine 106 were not investigated.

Recently, Wild et al. investigated the structure–property relationship of various types of bisterpyridines (50a, 57–58, 88–90 and 107–109).193 For this purpose, different π-conjugated spacer units were incorporated into bisterpyridines by systematic variation of the spacer as well as the linker. The π-conjugated spacer comprising a dialkoxybenzene-, a dialkylfluorene- or an anthracene-containing system was linked to the terminal terpyridine units by double bonds (50a, 57–58) and compared to the corresponding architectures with triple bonds (88–90) or 1H-1,2,3-triazole moieties (107–109, Table 11). UV-vis absorption as well as emission spectroscopy of all these bisterpyridines in dilute solutions and thin spin-coated films were applied. In accordance with DFT calculations, a double bond attached to the phenyl-terpyridine moiety led to a higher degree of conjugation,205,206 as confirmed by the most pronounced bathochromic shift in absorption and emission and an additional increase of the extinction coefficient of bisterpyridines 50a and 58 compared to those containing either a triple bond (88 and 89) or a triazole (107 and 108). The anthracene-bearing bisterpyridine 58 exhibited a steric interaction between the vinylic protons of the double bond and the protons in the 1- and 8-positions of the anthracene unit. This resulted in a torsion and, thereby, a hindered conjugation which was confirmed by a decreased bathochromic shift in absorption, a clearly larger Stokes shift and a remarkably low quantum yield compared to the other ditopic ligands (Table 5, 50a and 58). The triazole moiety can only be considered as a part of the overall conjugated system in very special cases (i.e. for fluorene derivative 107), as confirmed by DFT calculations.193

3.2 Rigid star-shaped π-conjugated 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridines
In recent years, various reviews dealing with terpyridine-based metallo-dendrimers and metal-containing star-shaped (macro)molecules have been published.1–7,126,156,160 However, in most cases the structures were built-up from 4′-O-substituted 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridines and only few examples are known where rigid, fully π-conjugated oligoterpyridines were utilized as core molecules for the construction of complex star-shaped metal-containing architectures.
In 1992, Constable and Cargill Thompson reported on the synthesis of the rigid tristerpyridine 110 with a phenyl moiety as the core (Fig. 20).266,358 A structurally related derivative bearing three so-called U-shaped phenyl-substituted terpyridine units (113) was published later by Winter et al. (Fig. 20).280 In these contributions, the established protocols for the Kröhnke-type162 and the domino-Mannich-Aldol condensation reactions,147,176 respectively, were applied to yield the tristerpyridines in moderate overall yields (25–35%). Tristerpyridines 111 and 112 (Fig. 20) as homologous to 110 were prepared by the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of 4′-phenyl-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine functionalized with a boronic acid ester.359,360 In these cases, significantly higher yields compared to the condensation reactions were obtained. As a common property and due to the absence of any solubilizing side chains a very low solubility of 110–113 in most organic solvents was reported.

He et al. synthesized tristerpyridine 114 by reacting 1a with n-butyllithium and, subsequently, with phenyltrichloro-silane (Fig. 21). Self-assembly of 114 with AgI ions into chiral architectures was reported for this tripodal substrate.255

Schmittel and co-workers prepared the D6h symmetric hexakisterpyridine 115 (Fig. 21).361,362 The terpyridyl arms were attached to the hexaethynylbenzene core in remarkably good yield (65%) via a 6-fold Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction. 115 was used by the authors for the construction of hexakis–heteroleptic complexes in the context of the general concept of so-called technomimetic molecules and, in particular, towards molecular wheels.363
The Pd0-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling reaction was also used for the synthesis of star-shaped terpyridines. The symmetric tristerpyridine 116 was obtained by Nishimori et al.364 in good yield (65%, Fig. 21) starting from 4′-((tributylstannyl)ethynyl)-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine365 and 1,3,5-tribromobenzene.
Porphyrin-based oligopyridyl systems have widely been studied due to their attractive photophysical properties and applied as substrates in photovoltaic processes.231–234 Besides these intensively investigated structures with one or two terpyridine units,148 only few examples are known where the porphyrin unit serves as the center for molecules with three or four terpyridine moieties attached. Such a tetrakisterpyridine-porphyrin derivative (117, see Fig. 21) as the potential core for the construction of porphyrin-containing metallo-dendritic architectures was reported recently by the group of Newkome.366117 was synthesized in very low yield (3%) from 4′-(4-formylphenyl)-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine (1f) and pyrrole following a microwave-assisted Adler-type condensation protocol.222 A set of structurally related tetrakisterpyridine derivatives with a phthalocyanine core (118) was prepared in moderate yields (35%) by condensation of the corresponding 4′-(3,4-dicyanophenyl)-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridines in the presence of ZnCl2 (Fig. 21).89
With respect to potential applications as functional (supramolecular) materials in the fields of photovoltaics or OLEDs, some highly fluorescent tris- (119–121) and tetrakisterpyridines (122) containing rigid hexaalkyl-truxene or dialkoxybenzene moieties were prepared by Yuan et al.305 and Wang et al.223 as well as Winter et al.219,302 (Fig. 21). The compounds were synthesized in moderate to high yields (35–81%) by combination of the Pd0-catalyzed cross-coupling and the Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons (HWE) condensation reaction. In contrast to the unsubstituted compounds 110–113, good solubility in most organic solvents was achieved by the incorporation of solubilizing alkyl- or alkoxy groups.
As for their linear mono- and bisterpyridine counterparts, the utilization of conjugated star-shaped terpyridines, e.g. in opto-electronic applications, has been proposed. Thus, the understanding of the photophysical properties of the materials is a requirement. A distinct influence of the conjugated linkage in 119 on the absorption and emission behavior was observed (Table 12).305 The longest wavelength emission within the series was determined for 119b containing a vinylenic linkage. Moreover, comparing the photophysical data of tristerpyridines 121 and 122, also the order of the conjugated subunits within the molecules was of importance.219,302

The more pronounced shift of the emission to longer wavelength occurred when the double bond was neighboring the terpyridine unit (121). In addition, increasing the number of terpyridine arms affected the photophysics (122 and 123). The remarkable Stokes shift of 4300 cm−1 for 123 pointed to significant changes in the molecular structure in the excited state.302 Time-resolved spectroscopy helped to gain detailed insight into the excited-state properties of a family of linear as well as star-shaped π-conjugated terpyridines.321,322
These examples underline the potential of rigid star-shaped π-conjugated terpyridines as building blocks for complex supramolecular functional materials. However, the still limited structural diversity and—in many cases—the large synthetic effort remain as considerable drawbacks.
4. Polydisperse π-conjugated 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridines
4.1 2,2′:6′,2″-Terpyridines in the side chain
An enormous diversity of π-conjugated polymers for potential applications, e.g. in the fields of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) or organic photovoltaics, has been published within the last few decades.318,319,367,368 For the synthesis of such materials polycondensation reactions are widely applied; among others, the efficient Pd0-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions are in the focus of modern polymer research. Different functional groups, conjugated and non-conjugated, have been introduced as lateral side chains by polymerization of the respectively functionalized monomers or via post-polymerization modifications (e.g. grafting methods). Also, transition metal binding sites, such as terpyridine moieties, can be introduced efficiently as side chains into polymeric materials using these approaches.318
In particular, two types of conjugated polymers with grafted terpyridines have been reported where (a) the conjugated system extends over the entire molecule including the terpyridine side chain or where (b) the conjugation into the side chains is interrupted by heteroatoms or alkyl spacers.8
For the synthesis of the fully conjugated polymers 124–131 (Fig. 22) different polycondensation reactions, such as Pd0-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions (i.e. Sonogashira,86,369 Suzuki,369 Heck369 and Buchwald–Hartwig256) and the Wittig257 as well as the Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons condensation370 were applied. Highly soluble and fluorescent polymers were obtained in 45 to 93% yield. The number-average molar masses (Mn) and polydispersity indices (PDIs) were determined by SEC, 1H NMR spectroscopy and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization–time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Table 13). However, in neither case a full characterization of the polymers, i.e. the thermal and mechanical properties as well as their processability, film-forming behavior or solid state properties, was carried out. Thus, characterization was only focussed on the photophysical and electrochemical properties in solution (Table 13). The photophysical data were in full accordance with those reported for the related π-conjugated polymers.318 In detail, absorption bands in the range of 300 to 450 nm were assigned to π–π* transitions of the polymer backbone, additional bands around 300 nm correspond to π–π* transitions of the terpyridine substituents. Bright photoluminescence (λPL = 400–520 nm, ΦPL up to 0.55) originated from the π-conjugated structures with little interference of the terpyridine arms. In the presence of various transition or rare earth metal ions quenching of the photoluminescence (e.g. FeII, NiII, CoII, CuII) and a pronounced ionochroism (e.g. FeII, CoII, CuII, PdII, EuIII) were observed and, therefore, the polymers might be of interest for applications as sensitive and specific fluorimetric chemosensors.86,235,256,257,369

Addition of transition metal ions to solutions of 124–131 will lead to cross-linking of the materials via intermolecular complexation. Rabindranath et al. investigated this behavior and observed the formation of a supramolecular gel (132) from 125a and ZnII ions by cross-linking (Scheme 15).256 However, a detailed insight into the structure, properties and potential applications of these supramolecular gel-like materials has not yet been reported.
 Scheme 15  Schematic representation of the cross-linking of a π-conjugated polymer with ZnII ions according to Rabindranath et al.256 
Polymers containing terpyridines and other metal binding sites in their side chains have recently been reviewed by Shunmugam and Tew.371 In general, the terpyridine moieties are attached via flexible ether linkages to the non-conjugated organic polymer backbone. In contrast, reports on conjugated polymers with terpyridine side chains attached via non-conjugated spacers are rare.23,86 Cheng et al. utilized the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction to synthesize low molar mass poly(dialkoxyphenylene-thiophene) (133) and poly(dialkyl-fluorene-thiophene) (134) with one and two pendant terpyridine side chains per monomer unit, respectively (Fig. 23, Table 13).23 The photophysical properties for these types of conjugated materials are listed in Table 13. Aiming for photovoltaic applications, these moieties were subsequently used for the preparation of trithiocyanato RuII–terpyridine complexes, which are known to be versatile sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells.372
 Fig. 23  Schematic representation of conjugated polymers with pendant non-conjugated terpyridine side chains according to Cheng et al.23 
The polymerization under Heck cross-coupling reaction conditions was also carried out using 1,4-divinylbenzene, 1,4-dialkoxy-2,5-diiodobenzene and an diiodo-functionalized terpyridine–RuII complex.373 The advantages of this earlier approach compared to the work by Cheng et al.23 are as follows: (a) the content of the RuII complex in the polymer can easily be tuned via the monomers’ ratio and (b) complete coordination of all terpyridine sites by RuII ions is guaranteed by performing the complexation prior to the polymerization.
4.2 2,2′:6′,2″-Terpyridines as part of the main chain
Besides dye-sensitized systems, also conjugated polymer-based organic solar cells374 as well as so-called hybrid cells375 combining these two types of photovoltaic devices are in the focus of current research. Among others, the incorporation of transition metal ions—such as RuII, OsII or ReI—via complexation into π-conjugated polymers is a common approach in the field of hybrid materials.236
In particular, Krebs and co-workers reported on the synthesis of π-conjugated oligomers21,376 and polymers18,22 of poly(phenylene-vinylidene)-type (PPV) end-capped with a terpyridine moiety as well as their application as building blocks for the construction of photovoltaic devices. The synthesis of the oligomers followed a stepwise and unidirectional approach,377i.e. the HWE condensation and hydrolytic deprotection in turn. The stepwise preparation of the terpyridine-functionalized oligo(phenylene-vinylidene) (OPV) trimer 137 is depicted in Scheme 16.376 The acetal-protected monomer 136376,377 was utilized as a key substrate and reacted with terpyridine 135 to yield 137 in an overall yield of 43%. The main advantages of this step-wise protocol are that (1) the length of the π-conjugated system can be controlled easily via the number of reaction sequences and (2) a reactive endgroup (i.e. aldehyde) for further modifications is maintained. A similar approach was followed by El-ghayoury et al.378 where an alkyne-functionalized OPV was reacted with 4′-bromo-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine under Sonogashira cross-coupling conditions.
 Scheme 16  Schematic representation of the synthesis of the terpyridine-terminated OPV trimer 137 according to Jørgensen and Krebs.376 
The philosophy of a stepwise and unidirectional synthesis was developed further by Hagemann et al.21 resulting in the preparation of a so-called “all-in-one molecule” (138) for organic solar cell applications (Fig. 24). The central part of 138, which was prepared in a multi-step organic synthesis, consisted of a dyad of a ZnII porphyrin and bisterpyridine–RuII complex. Pendant arms of an oligohexylthiophene (OHT) and an OPV were meant to function both as antennae for light harvesting as well as donor and acceptor groups for attraction of photoinduced charges.21 However, very poor performance in terms of converting light to energy was observed for 138 (about 1000 times less efficient compared to a device based on a 3-hexylthiophene oligomer), mainly due to bad morphology as well as nonradiative energy conversion by the ZnII porphyrin moiety. Consequently, this subunit was omitted by Krebs and co-workers in their later contributions.
 Fig. 24  Schematic representation of the multidomain compound 138 for photovoltaic applications according to Hagemann et al.21 
For the preparation of PPVs bearing a terpyridine ligand at one chain end, Duprez et al.18 applied a directed Heck cross-coupling reaction of 4′-(4-bromophenyl)-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine 1a and monomer 139 to obtain donor- (OF-tpy, 140) and acceptor-type polymers (CNOF-tpy, 141) (Scheme 17, Table 13). The macroligands were used for the formation of homo- and copolymers by selective complexation of RuII ions. Their synthesis and the preparation of photovoltaic devices thereof will be discussed in a later section.
 Scheme 17  Schematic representation of the synthesis of PPV-terpyridines according to Duprez et al.18 
Related to this polycondensation approach, Weder and co-workers synthesized polydisperse conjugated ditopic macroligands with two 2,6-bis(1-methyl-1H-benzo[d]imida-zol-2-yl)pyridines (BIPs) as endgroups (143).349,350,379 For this purpose, the standard protocols for Sonogashira polycondensation were applied (i.e. Pd(PPh3)4/CuI as the catalytic system in toluene/diisopropylamine). The size of the oligomers could be easily controlled by adjusting the ratio of the diethynyl and dihalogen compounds. An excess of ethynyl-BIP (142) was added as the end-capping agent in order to obtain a high degree-of-functionalization (Scheme 18). Due to the highly extended conjugated system, a distinct bathochromic shift of both absorption and emission maxima compared to the monodisperse ligand 102 was observed (Table 10). The photophysical properties of 143 mirrored those of PPE-type polymers318,319 with only marginal influence from the terminal BIP substituents. Macroligand 144 with an additional non-conjugated chain—resulting in electronic decoupling of the conjugated backbone from the terminal ligand sites—was also prepared. Very high solubility of the macroligands was reported, which is an advantage when the materials are further utilized as prepolymers for the construction of high molar mass supramolecular polymers.379
 Scheme 18  Schematic representation of polydisperse ditopic macroligands according to Weder and co-workers.349,350,379 
The group of Krebs also reported on the synthesis of a polythiophene end-functionalized with a terpyridine ligand.22 However, the polymerization could not be carried out using the uncomplexed terpyridine as the terminating agent and, thus, an appropriately functionalized heteroleptic RuII complex was utilized. The synthesis and the application as photoactive material in PV devices will be detailed later (see Section 5.5).
Finally, Pefkianakis et al.380 utilized 4′-(4-bromo-methylphenyl)-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine as the initiator for the polymerization of a vinyl-functionalized oxadiazole monomer under controlled atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) reaction conditions. The resulting material is up to now the exclusive example for a non-conjugated polymer end-functionalized with a terpyridine ligand and pendant conjugated units.381 The molar masses (Mn) varied between 2000 and 5000 g mol−1 with narrow PDI values of 1.18–1.38 for the low-molar-mass polymers. Also high-molar-mass polymers were reported (Mn around 43000 g mol−1), but in these cases the PDI values were increased significantly to 2.3.
5. π-Conjugated terpyridines in supramolecular architectures
5.1 Metallopolymers containing 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine units or other structurally related tridentate ligands
Synthetic organic polymers play, due to the possible enormous variety of their physical and chemical properties as well as their wide spread commercial application, an important role in modern society and research. In particular, in the last decade—despite the well-known, cheap and widely-used thermoplastics and elastomers—the focus has shifted to more high-value materials.318,374,382–386 Metal ions play a substantial role in modern and materials science, e.g. with respect to electronic application,387 furthermore, metal centers also play a critical role in the function of biological macromolecules. Thus, combining these two, organic polymers and metal ions, turned out to be a fruitful avenue to new functional materials. The successful free radical polymerization of vinyl ferrocene more than 50 years ago was the initial point for the broad field of metallopolymers.388 Starting from this specific example a variety of different metallopolymers was synthesized and investigated.4,6,236,352,386,389–397 These great efforts in scientific research made metallopolymers one of the fastest developing fields in macromolecular chemistry. In traditional polymers, the monomers are linked by covalent bonds, and the nature of the monomers as well as the molar mass defines their physical properties. The great interest in these new materials is mainly attributed to their special properties, which represent a combination of the physical, electronic and optical properties of the organic polymer as well as the physical, electronic and optical properties of the incorporated metal complexes. For this reason, π-conjugated oligomers and polymers, one of the youngest polymer classes which were discovered almost 40 years ago,398 are very interesting building blocks for the combination with metal complexes. These (semiconducting) polymers feature outstanding electrical and optical properties; due to these properties they are also considered as synthetic metals.399 They found applications in many fields, like polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs)318 and solar cells.374,400 It is important to note that in particular in the field of π-conjugated polymers the introduction of metal complexes can also lead to undesired properties which requires a chemical decoupling of the metal complex and the conjugated oligomer/polymer. The fruitful combination of transition metal complexes and π-conjugated polymers has led to many applications—in OLEDs,306,387,397 in photovoltaic devices401 as well as in photonic crystals—depending on the structure of the respective polymer.393,402,403
As simple the definition of metallopolymers is, i.e. all organic polymers which contain metal ions, as diverse and sometimes complex are the structures of the synthesized polymers. In general, metal complex moieties can be attached to the polymer as part of the main chain or as pendant group. According to Ciardelli et al. there are three different types of metal containing polymers (Fig. 25).404
 Fig. 25  Schematic representation of the general architectures of metal-containing polymers.404 
In Type I polymers, the metal ions/complexes are attached to the polymer at the side chain or endgroup by (a) electrostatic interaction, (b) coordination bond or (c) covalent bonding. Depending on the distance between the polymer and the complexes no or only weak interactions between both can be observed. Type II polymers possess the metal as part of the main chain, either by (a) covalent linkage or (b) metal–ligand coordination. The direct coupling of the metal to the conjugated backbone leads to an increased influence of the metal complex on the properties of the conjugated backbone.
In Type III polymers, the metal ions are embedded into the polymer matrix by physical interaction. The driving force for the formation of these polymers is the negative free energy as a result of the polymer chelate effect. In this section, we will concentrate on terpyridines and other structurally-related tridentate ligands as a complexing agent for metal ions, thus only Types Ib and IIb are compatible. Conjugated polymers are of highest interest in research, caused by its manifold application, therefore we will focus mainly on metallopolymers consisting of conjugated oligomers/polymers which are connected by transition metal complexes. In addition we will also include conjugated polymers of Type Ib.
In order to synthesize such polymers three main routes are commonly used. A complex monomer can be polymerized, resulting in a polymer, bearing a metal complex in the side chain. If the complex is stable applying the polymerization conditions one can be sure to have neither uncomplexed ligands nor free metal ions within the polymer (Fig. 26, route Ib1). For route Ib2 a suitable polymer is decorated with a metal complex, bearing a functionality to bind to the polymer. Using this procedure also no uncomplexed ligands or metal ions will be present in the final polymer. Depending on the reaction applied for coupling, the conversion of the linker groups can be incomplete, which can be further utilized to synthesize polymers bearing different amounts of metal complexes. Polymers possessing already a ligand bound to the backbone can be complexed either by appropriate metal ions, leading to crosslinking, or by a metal complex, resulting in polymers bearing a metal complex in the side chain (Type Ib3). Using this route, in contrast to Ib1 and Ib2, an uncomplexed ligand can still be present in the final polymer. Depending on the complex stability and the final application one has to choose a suitable route for every polymer.
 Fig. 26  Schematic representation of different approaches for the synthesis of metallopolymers (type I and II), containing transition metal complexes. 
As already stated, the main focus of this review lies on metallopolymers bearing metal complexes in the main chain. Three routes can be applied to synthesize such polymers (Fig. 26). Route IIb1 is based on cyclic monomers. The cycle is opened and the linear polymer is formed. This route is very popular, in particular for the synthesis of metallocenophanes.389
In route IIb2 the conjugated oligomer/polymer connecting the metal complexes is formed during the polymerization. For this purpose, the metal complexes have to be stable under the polymerization conditions. In principle, the established polymerization techniques towards conjugated polymers (e.g. electropolymerization, C–C (cross-)coupling reactions) can be applied. The obtainable molar masses of polymers which are synthesized according to route IIb2 can be determined by the Carothers' equation.405 Both, an exact stoichiometry and a high yield of the coupling reaction are necessary to obtain high molar mass polymers. However, this technique is not as versatile when compared to route IIb3. There, the step-growth reaction of a conjugated oligomer/polymer bearing two ligands is realized by the appropriate metal ion. Due to the attractive experimental protocol, i.e. the ditopic conjugated ligand and a metal salt are reacted in a suitable solvent, this method is frequently applied. However, the complexation constant has to be high enough to form high molar mass polymers.
There are different principle non-covalent interactions available for the synthesis of coordination polymers: hydrogen bonding,390,406–409 π–π-stacking,407,408,410,411 van-der-Waals interactions407,408,410,411 and transition metal ion coordination.1,4,6,352,386,389,390,392,407,408 Also combinations of these interactions within one supramolecular material, e.g. hydrogen bonding and metal coordination, have been reported.127,412,413 The main difference between covalently connected polymers and supramolecular polymers is the dependence of the average degree of polymerization (DP) on the strength of the endgroup interaction414 and, therewith, the solvent, the temperature and the concentration. For reversible coordination polymers eqn (1) (K: binding constant, M: monomer concentration) and Fig. 27 can be applied to estimate the degree of polymerization.407,410,415 DP ≈ (K[M])1/2(1)
 Fig. 27  Theoretical plot of the degree of supramolecular polymerization vs. association constant Ka (M−1), at two different concentrations according to an isodesmic self-assembly model.410 Figure copyright American Chemical Society and reproduced with permission. 
To obtain polymers with a high degree of polymerization, a high binding constant between the repeating units is required. In analogy to covalent condensation polymers, the chain length of supramolecular polymers can be varied by the addition of monofunctional “chain stoppers”.416 The major advantage of coordination polymers, compared to their classical counterparts, is the possibility to produce tailor-made materials, utilizing the knowledge about binding constants and, consequently, the way of coordination. For intermolecular interactions, a detailed investigation of both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the metal complexes is necessary to choose a suitable metal–ligand combination for the respective application. The thermodynamic properties, expressed by the binding constants, reveal whether the complex will be stable or unstable, whereas the kinetic properties are expressed by the terms inert or labile and can be expressed, for example, in the half-life of the respective metal–ligand pair.1,352
For several applications the ideal combination is, therefore, a system that provides a complex of high thermodynamic stability combined with high kinetic lability.417–419 This combination ensures the construction of a high molar mass coordination polymer, improved by the inherent advantages of reversible supramolecular systems, that is, self-healing, the incorporation of additional units with identical ligand units, to produce, e.g. copolymers and switching between the polymeric, oligomeric and monomeric states. Furthermore, external stimuli can be applied for the reversible polymers to enable switching from the monomeric state to the polymeric state or between different self-assembled architectures such as macrocycles and polymers. Some of these systems can be repeatedly switched, in contrast to classical covalent polymers, which are formed irreversibly.390,407,420–422
5.2 Coordination polymers based on π-conjugated bisterpyridines

5.2.1 Polymerization by coordination approach. 
As pointed out earlier, various types of N-heterocyclic ligands (e.g. 2,2′-bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline and 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine) have attracted much interest as supramolecular templates due to their high binding affinity towards many transition metal ions. In particular, 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine is ideally suited for the construction of coordination polymers.8 The prevention of Δ/Λ-chirality in comparison to related metal complexes with 2,2′-bipyridine ligands by formation of distorted octahedral complexes and the easy access to 4′-substituted terpyridines enables the efficient coupling to stiff conjugated spacer molecules and, therewith, offers the possibility to synthesize linear metallopolymers.1,8,71,193,219,423–425 Among others, the most commonly used method for the synthesis of such terpyridine-based metallopolymers is the complexation of a linear ditopic ligand by addition of stoichiometric amounts of transition metal ions (Fig. 28). In view of potential opto-electronic application, therefore, a large variety of spacer units was introduced for this purpose.
 Fig. 28  Schematic representation of the formation of a linear coordination polymer, using a ditopic ligand and a metal ion. 
If rare earth metal ions are utilized for complexation of a ditopic tridentate ligand, 3D polymer networks will be formed. Due to their f-orbitals, these metal ions can establish up to nine coordinative bonds and, therefore, bind up three tridentate ligands.348,426–429 A remarkable example taking advantage of this special complexation behavior was published by Rowan et al.390,420–422 Ditopic BIP-type ligand 145 with a flexible pentaethylene glycol spacer unit were utilized (Fig. 29). The synthesis of metallopolymers based on these ligands with 97% of CoII or ZnII and 3% of LaIII or EuIII produced gel-like materials. All four possible combinations were realized, leading to thermoresponsive polymers—upon heating the gel becomes fluid again. Furthermore, the polymers were found to be thixotropic, meaning the gels became fluid upon shaking. The intense luminescence of the gel with the couple ZnII/EuIII could be “switched off” either by heating or adding a dilute solution of formic acid, which bound to the EuIII centers and quenched the emission.

The materials reported by Rowan et al. represent excellent examples for multiresponsive metallopolymers. The broad field of metallopolymers based on flexible (i.e. non-conjugated) telechelic terpyridine-type ligands with respect to synthesis and potential applications was recently reviewed by Chiper et al.155 Therefore, we will focus in the following only on systems containing π-conjugated spacer units.
Previously, we summarized the synthesis and properties of different kinds of π-conjugated bisterpyridine architectures, the majority of these ligands was also used for the synthesis of coordination polymers, incorporating different transition metal ions. In general, the ligand is dissolved in a polar, non-coordinating solvent to ensure solubility and high molar masses of the resulting polymer. Subsequently, the transition metal salt is added either at once or in small portions. After an appropriate reaction time, anion exchange is carried out in most cases to ensure solubility in common organic solvents. Following this protocol, RuII, ZnII, FeII, NiII, CoII and CdII containing metallopolymers were obtained. The selection of the metal ion depends on the targeted potential application of the respective polymer. For instance, the metals forming kinetically inert complexes (e.g. RuII, NiII, FeII and CoII) will quench the emission of the conjugated spacer unit by metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT, radiationless deactivation caused by the low 3MC state),149 whereas the complexes with labile ZnII do not show MLCT absorption and, therefore, the corresponding metallopolymers remain emissive.
In 1992, the group of Constable introduced the general concept of terpyridyl-functionalized telechelics (i.e. bisterpyridines 11a and 12, tristerpyridine 110), which can form coordination polymers upon addition of metal ions.266,358,430 In the following, Rehahn and co-workers published the synthesis of well-defined RuII coordination polymers utilizing tetrapyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c:3″,2″-h:2‴,3‴-j]-phenazine (tppz) and [Ru(bpy)Cl3]n. The polymers showed excellent solubility in water and ethanol (Cl− as counterion) or acetonitrile (PF6− as counterion).431,432
Metallopolymers based on RuII ions and terpyridine ligands possess very promising photophysical and electrochemical properties, since they have the potential to facilitate the charge carrier generation. Such metal complexes usually exhibit a reversible RuII/RuIII redox process and some ligand-centered redox processes. In addition, when incorporated into a polymer, a RuII complex will influence the optical as well as the electronic properties of the polymer due to its characteristic metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition around 500 nm, thus extending the absorption range of the material. Therefore, such RuII coordination polymers were applied as the photoactive layer in solar cells.28,433 Vellis et al. used three different linear ditopic ligands and a tritopic ligand for complexation. Reaction with Zn(OAc)2 at room temperature or RuCl3 in a EtOH/THF mixture at reflux leads to linear polymers (146b/c, 147b/c) and 3D networks (148, 149, Fig. 30).28 The ruthenium polymers were then used as an additional layer in a P3HT/PCBM bulk-heterojunction solar cell resulting in efficiencies of 0.33–0.71%. Wild et al. synthesized two ZnII and two RuII containing π-conjugated metallopolymers (146a, 147a, 150, 151), utilizing in both cases the same ligands (Fig. 30).433 The RuII metallopolymers (147a, 151) could be identified by SEC, analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and viscosimetry as high molar mass materials. Applying spin-coating homogeneous films of the polymers could be produced. However, the introduction of the RuII metallopolymers, blended with PCBM[60], as the photoactive layer in bulk-heterojunction solar cells resulted in very low efficiencies due to morphology problems, caused by the different solubility behavior of the PCBM derivative and 146a or 151, respectively.433

Besides polymer solar cells (PSCs), (supramolecular) polymer light-emitting devices (PLEDs) represent one further highly active field of research.318,352,387 In this respect, the combination of ZnII or CdII ions with conjugated bisterpyridines appears to be well-suited, since—contrary to materials containing RuII or FeII ions—the incorporation of these d10 metal ions will not quench the emission of the conjugated spacer unit of the metallopolymer (Table 14). In general, depending on the electronic nature of the spacer unit, the absorption and emission maximum is only slightly shifted. Therefore, the emission color of the so-produced metallopolymers can easily be tuned simply by varying the conjugated spacer unit.

Chen et al. presented a series of CdII coordination polymers (152, 153), synthesized by self-assembly polymerization of bisterpyridine ligands, featuring an oligofluorene- and a triphenylamine spacer unit, respectively (Fig. 31).434 As a considerable drawback, cadmium salts are expensive and known to be cancerogenic, since CdII can replace ZnII in many biological systems. Thus, the low cost and environmentally friendly ZnII is more often used for the synthesis of room temperature emissive terpyridine metallopolymers.
 Fig. 31  Schematic representation of metallopolymers containing CdII ions.434 
Since terpyridine complexes with ZnII ion are kinetically labile, the mixing of different monomers will result in a random copolymer, enabling the coverage of the whole visible spectrum. The assumption of reversible self-assembly and deassembly of bisterpyridine ZnII coordination polymers upon addition of an excess of ZnII ions was supported by DOSY NMR spectroscopy as well as fluorescence anisotropy measurements.353 Both methods are sensitive to the diffusion coefficients of the analyte and resulted in a significantly decreased diffusion coefficient for a zinc polymer (1∶1 ratio of ligand and ZnII) compared to the fragments obtained by exceeding the 1∶1 ratio. Due to the lability of the complexes it is difficult to determine the degree of polymerization of the metallopolymers. The common methods such as SEC, AUC or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry are not applicable for this kind of materials. However, endgroup analysis using 1H NMR spectroscopy can be applied to estimate the degree of polymerization. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigations by Stepanenko et al. revealed the deposition of rigid metallopolymers with average chain lengths of up to 30–35 repeating units from solution onto a mica surface.435
Due to the wide variety of synthesized systems of the general structure {[Zn(bisterpyridine)](PF6)2}n, Table 14 provides an overview of the utilized spacer units as well as the photophysical and electroluminescence data of the materials. Contrary to the metallopolymers with RuII, FeII or OsII ions all ZnII polymers summarized here were—due to their lability—exclusively synthesized via the coordination route (Fig. 26, route IIb3). In particular, the groups of Lin337–339 and Schubert303,306,345,433 presented highly diverse libraries of supramolecular polymers by variation of the conjugated spacer units. The resulting materials showed absorption maxima in the range of 350 to 450 nm. The introduction of BODIPY (105)346,351 or perylene-bisimide spacer units (104)353,435 could even push the absorption maximum of the resulting polymers up to around 600 nm (Fig. 32).
 Fig. 32  Schematic representation of ZnII coordination polymers, containing perylene-bisimide (104) or BODIPY-type or spacer units (105).346,351,352,435 
As pointed out above, the synthesis of random ZnII co-polymers can be performed by simply mixing the respective ligand monomers in an appropriate ratio. After addition of ZnII ions, the monomers will then assemble in a quasi-statistical manner.303,338,339,433 According to Lin et al., the stepwise-directed assembly of two bisterpyridines with ZnII ions resulted in a metallocopolymer with alternating ligands.338 However, due to the lability of the complexation a quasi-statistical order seems to be more conclusive. Recently, Schlütter et al. synthesized a statistical ZnII coordination polymer {[Zn(88)0.5(95)0.5](PF6)2}n where an energy transfer between an electron-rich “donor” (88) and an electron-deficient “acceptor” ligand (95) could be observed.303
Contrarily to the behavior of the simply mixed monomers (bisterpyridines 88 and 95) (Fig. 33) the excitation at the longest absorption band wavelength of the polymer resulted in a distinct domination of the emission attributed to the acceptor-unit. Only a shoulder confirms the emission originating from the donor-part. Both decreasing as well as increasing the excitation wavelength lead to a further reduction of the donor-based emission. The fact that a simple mixture of 88 and 95 revealed no indication for an energy transfer whereas the corresponding ZnII-based statistical copolymer was able to, proves that the central ZnII-terpyridine moieties play a crucial role in the mediation of such a transfer.

Bottom: normalized PL spectra obtained at different acceptor (95) to donor (88) ratios.303 Figure copyright American Chemical Society and reproduced with permission. 
Supramolecular polymers based on ZnII ions with tuneable and predictable photophysical properties are easy to be synthesized and, furthermore, can be processed from solution (e.g. by spin-coating or inkjet printing techniques), thus they can be considered as emissive materials in light emitting devices. The first examples of PLED devices using ZnII coordination polymers were constructed by Che and co-workers,304 followed by other groups (Table 14).306,337–339 In order to achieve a good processability, an adequate solubility in organic solvent is a requirement. However, most of the known systems exhibit a considerably low solubility, even in the presence of long or branched alkyl chains. As significant improvement, Winter et al. introduced poly(ε-caprolactone) chains on the backbone of the polymer to enhance both processability and film-forming ability of the materials.345


5.2.2 Self-assembly of metallopolymers. 
Besides directly adsorbing and investigating the metallopolymers via spin-coating from a DMF solution onto surfaces, in particular the group of Kurth used the coordination polymers further for the self-assembly of complex layer architectures. These systems were then successfully applied as electrochromic devices or molecular switches.392,445–447 In order to gain further insight into the interplay of electrostatic interactions between polyelectrolyte polymers and their counter ions, detailed investigations were carried out, using two different RuII metallopolymers based on oligophenylene-bridged bisterpyridines.448 Hinderberger et al. demonstrated by continuous wave EPR and double electron resonance spectroscopy (DEER), utilizing the spin-carrying dianion Fremy's salt (i.e. potassium nitrosodisulfonate), that the spatial distribution of the counterions reflects the spatial distribution of charges on the polymer chain. Furthermore, the counterion cloud around bis(terpyridine)-coordinated transition metal centers could be shown to have an almost Gaussian radial distribution with a width of approximately 0.5 nm.448 Owing to the high charge density, the solubility of metallo-supramolecular polyelectrolytes (MEPEs) critically depends on the counter ions. Since most bisterpyridine ligands are of hydrophobic nature, water solubility mediating counterions—such as chlorine or acetate—have to be used to synthesize water soluble MEPEs.444 In particular, the group of Kurth has been active in this field synthesizing MEPEs 157 with bisterpyridine 11a and either FeII, CoII or NiII ions, carrying out detailed characterization of the resulting polymers and self-assembling them, making use of their pronounced polyelectrolyte character (Fig. 34).4,6,352,441–444,449–452
 Fig. 34  Schematic representation of the hierarchical self-assembly of terpyridine-based coordination polymers. Redrawn according to publications by Kurth and co-workers.402,436–444 
Recently, the same group developed a reliable method to obtain MEPEs in a reproducible way applying conductometric titration of the metal ions to the ligand. Accordingly, the authors could exactly realize a 1∶1 stoichiometry, required for a high degree of polymerization.299 After spin-coating of the materials (157, M = FeII or NiII), the shape and size could be determined by AFM and small angle neutron scattering (SANS); the chains obtained from rigid monomer 11a revealed an estimated length of up to 500 nm, corresponding to a degree of polymerization of ∼370 or a molar mass of ∼200000 g mol−1 (Fig. 35a–c).299 For comparison a flexible 1,3-bis[4′-oxa(2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridinyl)]propane ligand (158) was also utilized resulting in smaller, discrete assemblies, presumably rings with three to four repeating units (Fig. 35d).
 Fig. 35  Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of spin-coated solutions of 157 (M = FeII) on mica:299 (a) [M]/[11a] = 0.60, (b) [M]/[11a] = 0.85, (c) [M]/[11a] = 0.98 and (d) with [M]/[158] = 1, where 158 is the flexible 1,3-bis[4′-oxa(2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridinyl)]propane. The corresponding average lengths of the MEPE rods are (a) 150, (b) 320 and (c) 460 nm. The uncorrected average diameter of the {[Fe(158)](OAc)2}n dots (d) is 6 nm. The rod diameter is ∼1.5 nm.

The positive charge of MEPEs 157 could be used to deposit them on negatively charged surfaces, such as poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PSS). The alternating layers of PSS and MEPE on a poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) modified quartz substrate (Fig. 34, middle) were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, microgravimetry, cyclic voltammetry and permeability measurements as well as surface plasmon spectroscopy (SPS).443,444,449 Related to this, Stepanenko et al. performed a comparable electrostatic self-assembly using ZnII coordination polymers 104.435 UV-Vis spectroscopy clearly indicated a linear increase of all complex bands after each double layer addition. The same method could also be applied with polystyrene latex particles as the template for the formation of core–shell particles (Fig. 34, left).441,442 Removal of the colloidal template core yielded multilayer capsules composed of coordination molecules (157) and covalent polyelectrolytes (PSS). Furthermore, the exchange of the counterions of 157 by amphiphilic anions, such as dihexadecyl phosphate (DHP), led to the formation of so-called polyelectrolyte–amphiphile complexes (PACs) (Fig. 34, right).436–440 The PACs were well-soluble in organic solvents spreading at the air–water interface and the resulting Langmuir monolayer could be transferred onto a solid support, employing the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) technique.453 Also, the PACs could be aligned by co-adsorbing them with alkanes on a graphite surface.437
One other interesting feature of these PACs is the possible spin-crossover phenomenon.436,440,454,455 FeII complexes in an octahedral ligand field can adopt both the low-spin 1A1g (LS) as well as the high-spin (HS) 5T2g conformation (Fig. 36). It is known that 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridines introduce a strong ligand field, therefore the metal ions are forced into a low-spin state (LS). For FeII ions, the terpyridine coordination polymers are diamagnetic, since all electrons are paired. At low temperature, 157-PAC assembled densely both in LB films and in the crystalline state, and therefore did not affect the strong crystal field around the FeII ions. Upon heating of the multilayer, the alkyl chains melted, resulting in a distortion of the metal ion coordination geometry. Consequently, the crystal field splitting of the d-orbital subsets decreased, resulting in a reversible spin transition from a diamagnetic LS to a paramagnetic LS state.440,454

The unfavorable coordination of the terpyridines around the FeII cations induced a lowering of the energy gap between the d-orbital subset, giving rise to a reversible transition from a diamagnetic low-spin state (left) to a paramagnetic high-spin state (right).440 Figure copyright American Chemical Society and reproduced with permission. 
Chandrasekar et al. showed bisterpyridine-analogs, such as 1,4-bis(2,6-di(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridin-4-yl)benzene (159, BPP-type)456 and 1,4-bis(2,6-bis(1-butyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)pyridin-4-yl)-benzene (160, BTP-type),457 to be suitable ditopic ligands for the synthesis of coordination polymers. Addition of one equivalent of FeII to 159 led to the formation of linear rigid coordination polymers (Fig. 37). These polymers exhibited a reversible spin transition at 323 K with a 10 K hysteresis loop, as proven by magnetic and Mössbauer spectroscopy studies.456 The self-assembly of 160, using EuIII ions, resulted in the formation of a highly luminescent 3D polymer. The structurally related BTP-type ligands 161 and 162 were synthesized by Schulze et al. and subsequently polymerized using [Ru(Me2CO)6](BF4)3, leading to linear rigid coordination polymers.458

Besides classical uncharged bisterpyridines, also viologen-like structures (163, Fig. 38) were used for the synthesis of metallopolymers using CoII, CdII, ZnII and FeII ions.446,447 Following a layer-by-layer self-assembly approach, multilayers were successfully applied as electrochromic devices. The general concept of viologen-type terpyridines was introduced by the groups of Constable459–461 as well as Thummel462 and later utilized by others.96,463–467

5.2.3 Chiral metallopolymers. 
The group of Abruña reported the synthesis of RuII metallopolymers bearing chiral pinene moieties annelated with the outer terpyridine rings (Fig. 39).468 Bridging two of these modified terpyridines via their 4′-positions with a 4,4′-biphenyl spacer and self-assembly with RuII ions resulted in a rigid bisterpyridine ligand (40) and metallopolymer 164, respectively. However, bridging via one pinene unit using a p-xylene spacer yielded the flexible polymer 165 (Fig. 39). The reaction of the enantiomeric ligands (±40) with FeII ions was monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy. As expected, the circular dichroism (CD) spectra of both enantiomers of polymer 165 showed mirror images. STM measurements could confirm this and were applied to estimate the degree of polymerization of up to 60 metal centers per chain.309 Another example for a chiral bisterpyridine building block was published by Kimura et al.279 Upon complexation of either the (R)- or (S)-enantiomer of BINOL-type bisterpyridine 18 (Fig. 7), using FeCl2 solution, the arising MLCT band in the UV–vis spectrum indicated the formation of metallopolymer 166 (Fig. 39d). CD investigations of 166 confirmed the chiral nature of the polymer (Fig. 39e).279

Furthermore, introducing chiral tetra(ethylene glycol) units in the 6-position of both terpyridine units resulted—after complexation with FeII ions—in the optically active metallo-supramolecular polymers 167 (Fig. 39c).213 The change in CD intensities as a function of added FeII ions confirmed the formation of optically active coordination polymers.469


5.2.4 Not-classical metallo-polymers. 
For the majority of the metallopolymers reviewed here, a classical metal complex with two terpyridine units coordinated to the metal centers represents the connection unit between various π-conjugated spacer systems. However, besides these conventional bisterpyridine coordination polymers, Rehahn et al. also synthesized the rod-like polymeric structure 169 containing monocyclometalated heteroleptic RuII complexes (Scheme 19).470 In this case, π-conjugated bis(2-phenylbipyridine)s were used as (co)monomer. In the first step of the polymer synthesis, bisterpyridine 30a was treated with two equivalents of ruthenium(III) chloride. The resulting dinuclear ‘metallomonomer’ was then converted with equimolar amounts of 168 to the metallopolymer 169. The homogeneous constitution of the soluble polymer could be confirmed and degrees of polycondensation (DP) >20 were estimated by 1H NMR spectroscopy.
 Scheme 19  Schematic representation of the synthesis of metallopolymer 169 bearing monocyclometalated RuII complexes.470 
Han et al. performed a systematical variation of both the spacer unit (i.e. one or two phenyl rings) and the electronic nature of the terpyridine moiety (i.e. introducing an electron-withdrawing (Br) or electron-donating (OMe) substituent in the 6-position) (bisterpyridines 11 and 29, Fig. 40a). After polymerization with FeII, RuII and CoII ions, respectively, the authors investigated the optical properties of the resulting polymers (Fig. 40b).215,298,308 Studying the electrochromic behavior revealed that introduction of the electron-donating methoxy-substituent markedly enhanced the switching stability as well as the reversibility of the resulting MEPEs with an observed absorption loss of approx. 20% after 4000 double-redox steps. The substituent also reduced the switching potential of the derived MEPEs.215 Furthermore, the emission properties of the RuII containing polymers (171) were investigated in detail at room temperature and 77 K.297 Recently, the same group studied the influence of a methyl-group as the electron-donating substituent in the 6-position.265 Again RuII, FeII and CoII containing polymers were synthesized and characterized by UV-Vis absorption and emission spectroscopy. Thereby, it could be shown that the luminescence of the resulting RuII polymers was quenched due to the introduction of the methyl-substituent. In case of the FeII polymers (170), the extinction coefficients of the methyl-substituted polymers 170g/h were much lower compared to those of the unsubstituted ones (170a/b). Thus, a methyl-substituent prevented the MLCT by steric hindrance.265 Additionally, Pal et al. could show recently how the introduction of triethylene glycol (TEG) chains at the ortho-position of the peripheral pyridine ring leads to an enhancement of the fluorescence of the corresponding FeII metallo-supramolecular polyelectrolytes (170i/k). 170k (Φ = 0.11) displays a retention of quantum yield that is nearly threefolds higher than that of the unsubstituted analog (170c; Φ = 0.04).301 This effect was attributed to a charge transfer occurring within the monomer between the electron-rich TEG-chain and the metal-coordinated, electron-deficient terpyridine moiety. Furthermore the TEG-chains could shield the metallopolymers and, consequently, the fluorescence quantum yields were enhanced.301,471

Fig. 40b shows the color of the ligands, polymerized using FeII, RuII and CoII ions, respectively. Contrary to the color tuning by using different π-conjugated spacer units (Table 14), in this case attachment of substituents to one pyridine ring and variation of the metal ions resulted in materials covering a large part of the color spectrum.
The previously discussed examples were all based on monodisperse, well-defined π-conjugated bisterpyridines. Weder and co-workers utilized their polydisperse macroligands 143 (see Scheme 18)348,350 as prepolymers for the polymerization by complexation with ZnII and FeII ions. The complexation with FeII ions led to drastic changes in the optical properties. An additional absorption—the MLCT band of the FeII complex—occurred and the fluorescence was completely quenched in contrast to the ZnII analogues. In case of the macroligand with additional aliphatic hexamethylene spacers (144), only slight changes of the optical properties upon complexation with FeII ions were observed due to the decoupling of the π-conjugated system of the oligomer and the metal complex.379


5.2.5 Metallopolymers using the complex first method. 
So far, all reviewed metallopolymers were classical coordination polymers, i.e. they were synthesized using a ditopic ligand and a transition metal ion (Fig. 26, route IIb3). However, since the binding constant of metal–terpyridine bis-complexes is very high for some transition metal ions (e.g. RuII, OsII, FeII) also the orthogonal “complex first” method (Fig. 26, route IIb2) was utilized for the synthesis of metallopolymers.
In 1999, Kelch and Rehahn showed a comparison of both general synthetic strategies (i.e. routes IIb2 and IIb3) mentioned above (Scheme 20).300,472 Applying the polymerization by complexation, ditopic ligand 30a was used for the complexation of RuII ions. Therefore, RuCl3·xH2O was activated with AgBF4 in acetone, 30a was added and the metallopolymer 173 could be obtained by in situ reduction of RuIII to RuII ions. The degree of polymerization could be estimated by 1H NMR spectroscopic endgroup analysis to be >30. Theoretically, strategy IIb2 should lead to the same metallopolymer. However, a polymer could not be obtained when the RuII bis-complex of 1a (174) was reacted with a substituted phenylene bisboronic acid (175). Due to many side reactions only oligomers could be obtained.
 Scheme 20  Schematic representation of the two orthogonal synthetic strategies towards metallopolymer 173 according to Kelch and Rehahn.300,472 
The group of Chan also prepared a RuII metallopolymer applying route IIb2.24 The Heck cross-coupling reaction of a [Ru(1b)2](PF6)2 (180) and 1,4-divinylbenzene resulted in a polymer with a molar mass of Mn = 8900 g mol−1 and a PDI value of 1.5 according to SEC analysis (181, Scheme 22). The inherent viscosity was measured to be 0.35 dL g−1 (in DMF at 30 °C). Furthermore, 1H NMR spectroscopic endgroup analysis revealed the signal of the vinyl endgroup to be less than 3%, indicating the high degree of polymerization.24 Using the layer-by-layer (LBL) processing technique up to 60 bilayers of the metallopolymer and a sulfonated polyaniline (SPAN) were deposited. The particular deposition conditions (e.g. pH, electrolyte and thermal annealing of multilayer films) had a significant impact on the film surface morphologies, which were investigated by AFM. Photovoltaic properties of the devices were studied and power conversion efficiencies in the order of 0.001% were achieved.24
Storrier et al. synthesized amide- and imide-linked FeII polymers also comparing both routes (Scheme 21).244,474 Both approaches—the conversion of the FeII complex of 1j (176a) with the spacer units 177a–c and the self-assembly by coordination using the ditopic ligands of 177a/b—resulted in metallopolymers with comparable NMR spectra. Since mass spectrometry and SEC analysis could not be applied for the determination of the degree of polymerization, endgroup analysis by 1H NMR spectroscopy was used. For this purpose, the polymerization of 178c was quenched with an excess of acetyl chloride and a degree of polymerization of 17 could be calculated.
 Scheme 21  Schematic representation of the synthesis of amide- and imide-linked metallopolymers.244,473,474 
 Scheme 22  Schematic representation of the synthesis of a metallopolymer by Heck cross-coupling reaction.24 
A similar reaction was performed by Ng et al. (Scheme 21).473 Polyimides 179c–h were synthesized by polymerizing monomer [Ru(1j)2]2+ (176b) with different dianhydride monomers 177c–h. The first step of the polymerization involved the ring-opening addition of the amino group to the acid anhydride to yield the corresponding polyamic acid. The imidization process was completed by heating the polyamic acid solution with a mixture of pyridine and acetic anhydride. The so-prepared RuII metallopolymers were utilized as the emitting layer in light emitting devices, showing an emission maximum around 650 nm.473
Finally, electropolymerization was applied as a synthetic tool related to route IIb2 (Fig. 26) for the preparation of metallopolymers with the complex as part of the main chain as well as the side chain. Hjelm et al. synthesized 4′-functionalized bis-complexes and reported their subsequent polymerization (Scheme 23).475–478 The complexes were equipped with mono-, di- or trithiophene units attached in the 4′-position to the terpyridines (182, 183), which could subsequently be polymerized electrochemically. Continuous voltammetric cycling in degassed dichloromethane or acetonitrile solutions (containing 0.1 M [n-Bu4N][BF4], 0.5 to 1 mM of complex and approximately 5% BF3·OEt2) resulted in the growth of the metal oxidation wave (0.89 V for RuII/RuIII and 0.48 V for OsII/OsIII) and a collapse of the ligand-based oxidation wave. The linear increase of the peak currents with scan number indicated the accumulation of the redox-active polymer (184, 185) onto the electrode surface. From semi-empirical calculations it was concluded that—due to the generation of a positive charge at the thienyl C5thienyl-position—this pattern is favored for coupling to yield linear metallopolymers.475 Upon electropolymerization, the metallopolymers were deposited at the electrodes as insoluble materials. Despite this limitation, absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) could be applied to characterize the monomers and resulting polymer films.
 Scheme 23  Schematic representation of the electropolymerization of thiophene-containing RuII and OsII terpyridine complexes.475–478 
Recently, Holliday and Zhu synthesized a bpp derivative, which was substituted with 3,4-ethylenedioxy-thienyl (EDOT) groups in the 4,4″-position (Scheme 24).479 The heteroleptic RuII–terpyridine complex 186 was synthesized and electropolymerization was carried out from ∼0.01 mM CH2Cl2 solution. For this purpose, continuous cycling between −1.25 V and 1.25 V, at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, was performed. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, UV-vis absorption and UV-vis-NIR spectro-electrochemistry revealed the polymer to possess the expected structure and being highly conjugated.

5.3 Supramolecular star-shaped and dendritic architectures based on π-conjugated 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridines
So far, star-shaped fully π-conjugated oligoterpyridines (see Fig. 38 and 39 for representative examples) have mainly been used for the formation of oligonuclear heteroleptic RuII and IrIII complexes.266,280,358,359,366,480–483 The electro-optical properties of the mostly trinuclear homometallic complexes, e.g. based on terpyridines 110–113 and 116, were investigated and the expected electronic-decoupling of the complexed metal-centers, due to disturbed π-conjugation in the parent terpyridine ligands, was confirmed by photophysical and electrochemical experiments. Nonetheless, these model compounds are of relevance for understanding the electro-optical behavior of more complex assemblies. However, the complexation of hexakisterpyridine 115 with CuI ions and ditopic phenanthroline-based ligands leading to a hexakis–heteroleptic complex of a “spoked wheel”-like structure can be considered to be rather of academic interest.361
The incorporation into more advanced architectures such as dendrimers or cross-linked materials is also hardly described in the literature. As already pointed out, a large variety of metallodendrimers containing more flexible terpyridine building blocks have been published. In general, these types of compounds have been designed to serve as antenna molecules for light-harvesting at peripheral photoactive sites and subsequent energy or electron transfer to internal reaction centers.486
Osawa et al. reported on a series of supramolecular dendritic nano-sized architectures with 6, 12 and 18 peripheral [Ru(tpy)2]2+ moieties, respectively.484,485 The syntheses were carried out in high yields applying Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions of functionalized heteroleptic RuII complexes. The largest representative out of the series (188) possessed a diameter of 9 nm with overall 38 positive charges (Fig. 41). Furthermore, Newkome and co-workers recently published dendrimers based on truxene-tristerpyridine 120 with 3 and 5 [Ru(tpy)2]2+ units, respectively, and molecular radii of 2.3 and 3.5 nm (the larger dendrimer 189 is depicted in Fig. 42).223 Preliminary photophysical experiments pointed to a potential use of the stiff dendritic architectures as sensitizers in photovoltaic devices.

Conjugated tris-(122) and tetrakisterpyridines (123) were utilized by Gohy et al. as hydrophobic cores for the construction of rod–coil star-shaped block copolymers.487 The hydrophilic block consisted of ω-(terpyridin-4′-yl)-poly(ethylene glycol) mono-methylether and RuII ions were used for the complexation. The self-organization in selective solvents was investigated by dynamic and static light scattering as well as cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). Well-defined vesicles were observed for the tri-arm derivative in acetone and acetone/water mixtures (Fig. 43).

The stability and reversibility of supramolecular binding of different surface-bound terpyridine complexes (e.g. IrIII, FeII, ZnII) were investigated by Haensch et al.140 The CuI-catalyzed alkyne–azide click (CCAAC) reaction was utilized by the authors in order to attach terpyridine complexes efficiently to azide-functionalized monolayers under mild conditions.488
Nishimori et al. reported on the construction of films of linear and branched wires on a gold-electrode surface.364 For the stepwise preparation of the branched assembly with FeII ions a thiol-functionalized surface-anchoring monoterpyridine ligand and tristerpyridine 116 were used (Fig. 44).141–146,489
An even distribution of nanodots of uniform size and shape was detected by scanning transmission microscopy (STM) and potential-step chronoamperometry (PSCA) suggesting that efficient electron conduction was occurring via successive electron hopping between neighboring redox sites within a molecular wire. The authors concluded that the terpyridine-based redox-polymer film would be useful for the development of molecular electronics.

Kubo et al. utilized in situ generated diazonium salts derived from 4′-(4-aminophenyl)-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine (1j) to covalently bind the terpyridines to carbon plates.135 A step-wise assembly82 of metal ions (FeII and CoII) and a bisterpyridine resulted in a multi-layered supramolecular film on the surface. In contrast to the work of Nishimori,364 π-conjugation of the film into the surface could be retained and, thus, significantly faster electron-transfer properties were observed in this case (k = 3000 s−1). This turnover rate was close to the highest so far reported value (k = 5000 s−1)490 and suggested the usefulness of the composite as redox mediator in (bio)electrochemical applications.135
The same diazonium approach was recently followed by Pan et al. to obtain terpyridine functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNs). Multilayer films were fabricated by layer-by-layer self-assembly with RuII ions onto different surfaces. Effective photoinduced charge transfer (photocurrent density of 65 nA cm−2) was observed for the films on ITO surfaces.136
In the context of terpyridine-modified surfaces, also a contribution from Duffort et al. should be mentioned.134 The authors synthesized polyoxometalate-based hybrid materials (POMs)491 with covalently bound terpyridine moieties. Grafting of the organic residue onto the inorganic core (i.e. PW11O40[SiPhI]2)3−) only had a marginal influence on the redox properties, maintaining the capability of the polyanions to serve as electron reservoirs and, thus, making the POM hybrids potential candidates for applications as photovoltaic devices or molecular memories.
5.4 Metallomacrocycles based on 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridines
In general, macrocyclic assemblies as well as coordination polymers can be obtained by the complexation of ditopic ligand systems with transition metal ions. As shown by the groups of Schubert,492–494 Constable495–498 and Kurth,299 flexible bisterpyridine building blocks tend to form both polymers (or oligomers) and macrocycles. In contrast to their linear counterparts, rigid bisterpyridines with angular geometry can also be utilized for these two purposes. For entropic reasons, small cyclic assemblies are generally preferred over polymers at low to medium concentrations.352,499 Cho et al. reported on the formation of a series of linear oligomers (containing 2–6 bisterpyridine units) based on angular bisterpyridine 14a and RuII ions.500 The individual oligomers with metal-free endgroups could be isolated by fractionation and characterized. In all cases, the cyclization of combinations of these oligomers driven by the laws of thermodynamics yielded a hexagonal metallomacrocycle.
The first report on defined small conjugated metallomacrocycles dates back to 1996 when Romero et al. reported on the self-assembly of angular bisterpyridine 70 with FeII ions into triangles and squares.501 However, the most prominent and fascinating examples of bisterpyridine-based metallomacrocycles with designed dimensionality and nuclearity were published in recent years by Newkome and co-workers.26,268–276,315,342,502–507 As the most common structural feature, the metal-binding sites are attached in the 1- and 3-positions of a phenyl ring (e.g. bisterpyridines 14, 43/44, 81–83) and, thus, the terpyridine units will form an angle of 120° with respect to each other, exactly the internal angle of a planar hexagon. Only in very few cases the formation of a stable pentameric by-product could be observed.507 Structural variants of this general motif include the incorporation of 3,6-bis(2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridin-4′-yl)-9-alkyl-carbazole (15)273 or 4,4′-bis(2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridin-4′-yl)-triphenylamine (16)26,275 as monomer. In the case of the carbazole derivative, the angle between the terpyridinyl moieties is widened to ca. 105° and, thus, the formation of pentagonal macrocycles becomes favored.
A variety of hexagonal homometallomacrocycles based on RuII,26,268–271,273,502–504,506 FeII,269,271–273,315,342,505 ZnII273,274,342,505 or CdII ions276 was obtained by self-assembly of angular π-conjugated bisterpyridines (macrocycles 190 and 191 as representative examples are depicted in Fig. 45). The formation of the RuII-containing macrocycles requires relatively harsh reaction conditions, involves in some cases a stepwise assembly of the building blocks and the isolated yields were reported in the range of 30 to 50%. In contrast, the self-assembly of angular bisterpyridine ligands with FeII, ZnII or CdII ions into macrocycles generally proceeds under much milder conditions and the products are formed in high to quantitative yields.
 Fig. 45  Schematic representation of bisterpyridine-based macrocycles according to Newkome and co-workers.274,315,342 
In addition to homometallomacrocycles, some metallomacrocycles based on both RuII and FeII ions were also described by Newkome and co-workers.271,272,504 The synthesis of these heterometallomacrocycles was enabled following a so-called semi-self-assembly approach. Applying this strategy pre-formed building blocks, such as the RuII bis-complex 192, could be assembled into macrocycles by the addition of FeII ions. Following this directed synthesis a series of hexameric metallomacrocycles 193 of the general formula [(14a)Fe6−nRun](PF6)12 (n = 3, 4, 5) were obtained (see Scheme 25 for the synthesis of 193b with n = 4).269
 Scheme 25  Schematic representation of the synthesis of the heterometallomacrocyle 193b according to Newkome et al.269 
Within this class of supramolecular macrocycles, the non-dendritic and perfectly self-similar Sierpinski hexagonal gasket508,509194 composed of bis- and tristerpyridine building blocks (14a and 110) and 36 RuII as well as six FeII ions is the most advanced example.504 The synthesis involved the semi-self-assembly of 14a and 110 (4∶2 ratio) with RuII ions to yield the outer, small hexagons, followed by the their self-assembly with FeII to the fractal gasket 194 in 35% yield (Fig. 46).
 Fig. 46  Schematic representation of the molecular Sierpinski hexagonal gasket 194 according to Newkome et al.504 
Transition metal ions with d6 (e.g. FeII, RuII) or d10 electron configuration (e.g. ZnII) preferentially form complexes of octahedral geometry with two terpyridine ligands. In addition, terpyridines are also known to form stable square-planar complexes with late d8 transition metal ions (e.g. PdII, PtII, AuIII) and a monodentate ancillary ligand. These types of complexes are, in particular, of biomedical relevance and were recently reviewed by Eryazici et al.102 However, only a few examples are known for advanced macrocyclic or 3D-architectures based on square-planar terpyridine complexes. The group of Bosnich reported on rectangular and trigonal prismatic assemblies containing PdII or PtII ions.510–520 These supramolecular materials were utilized as selective molecular recognition centers for various types of guest molecules.
Besides NMR spectroscopy, electrospray ionization (ESI) and, recently, travelling wave ion mobility (TWIM) mass spectrometry521 were found to be highly versatile tools for the characterization of metallomacrocycles, in particular for the systems containing the highly stable RuII-bisterpyridine connectivity no fragmentation of the supramolecular assemblies was observed under the applied measurement conditions.502 XPS was used as a reliable tool to quantify the atomic ratio of transition metal ions within the heterometallomacrocycles.504 Furthermore, single-molecule imaging techniques, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) were utilized for the visualization of the nanoscopic hexagonal macrocycles.269,504 The TEM image of a hexagonal homometallomacrocycle containing FeII ions is depicted in Fig. 47.269 The TEM analysis gave evidence of the size and shape of the macrocycle which was in good agreement with the value determined from a computer generated CPK model.

Overall, bisterpyridine-based metallomacrocycles appear to be mainly of scientific interest and applications looking beyond their fascinating structures have hardly been investigated. However, based on their electro-optical properties, the implementation of the materials in, e.g., dye-sensitized solar cells272,273,275 or organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDS)273,274,505 has been envisioned. Referring to these, three examples shall be briefly highlighted. The fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells of the general configuration (ITO:TiO2/metallomacrocycle:KI–I2 electrolyte/graphite) showed moderate to good performances for different types of macrocycles; however, the best results were obtained for the pentameric system containing RuII ions and alkyl-carbazole bisterpyridine derivative 15: short circuit current (Isc) of 0.3 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 290 mV, fill factor (FF) of 26.3% and photoconversion efficiency (η) of 1.53%.273 Furthermore, the ionic coordination of a water-soluble hexameric metallomacrocycle containing RuII ions and oxidized single-wall carbon nanotubes (oxi-SWNT) resulted in the formation of a composite material with high potential for utilization in the fields of photovoltaics or electronic nanodevices (Fig. 48).506

A ZnII-based hexagonal metallomacrocycle was also introduced as emissive species into an electroluminescent (EL) device. The device configuration and the energy levels of the individual components are summarized in Fig. 49. At a bias voltage of 6.9 V, green emission with a peak maximum at 515 nm was observed (CIE coordinates: x = 0.28, y = 0.48). The optimized device showed a maximum efficiency of 0.16 cd A−1 and a turn-on voltage of about 4 V. The maximum luminance of 39 cd m−2 was obtained under a driving voltage of 7.6 V.505

5.5 Supramolecular materials based on terpyridine-containing π-conjugated polymers
Despite all limitations in the purification, the so-called “all-in-one” molecule 138 (Fig. 24) was introduced into a bulk-heterojunction PV device of the common geometry ITO/PEDOT:PSS/138/Al.21 Though the energy could be efficiently converted internally, 138 was inefficient in generating and separating charge carriers and, thus, leading to a very poor device performance. Since charge separation could theoretically also arise through the MLCT transition followed by migration of the electron and hole into different pendant π-conjugated arms, the porphyrin moiety might be obsolete. Consequently, the donor- and acceptor-type terpyridine macroligands 140 and 141 were utilized by Duprez et al.18 for the preparation of two homopolymers (195 and 196) and a copolymer (197) in moderate yields (Fig. 50). Characterization of the polymers was carried out by 1H NMR, UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy.
 Fig. 50  Schematic representation of the RuII-containing metallopolymers 195–197.18 
The materials were fabricated into two different types of devices—a polymer solar cell and a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Concerning the first type, very low efficiencies were found in all cases (<0.01%). The poor film-forming ability resulted in low device resistance, open circuit voltage (Voc) as well as short circuit current (Isc). Sublimation of a layer of C60 on top of a spin-coated film of 195 helped to slightly improve the photovoltaic performance. The best results were obtained employing a device geometry of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/195/Al with an output power of 0.86 μW cm−2 and a fill factor of 26%. Despite the absence of specific anchoring groups (e.g. carboxylate, phosphonate), absorption on TiO2 films was observed and much better performances were achieved when the polymers were applied in DSSCs. The best performance was found when Co(btp)3ClO4 was used as electrolyte, which allows polymer based dye-sensitization without the iodine electrolyte drawback of polymer degradation.522 For the co-polymer I/V-promising characteristics of (Isc = 0.71 mA cm−2, Voc = 315 mV and maximum power (Pmax) of 0.22 mW) were recorded.
The group of Krebs attached a poly(3-hexylthiophene) chain in a Stille cross-coupling reaction to the zwitterionic RuII complex 198 (Scheme 26) yielding a three domain polymer (199), i.e. an anchoring, a charge injection and a light-harvesting/energy transfer domain.22 A degree of polymerization of about 12 (Mn = 2100 g mol−1) was determined by SEC and 1H NMR spectroscopy. When fabricated into an all-polymer PV device only very poor efficiencies were observed. However, the incorporation of 198 or 199 into photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar cells (Scheme 26) revealed the potential of the materials to serve as dyes in PV devices. For 199 the I/V characteristics were as follows: Isc = 0.456 mA cm−2, Voc = 555 mV, Pmax = 0.055 mW.

Bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic cells with the simple configuration ITO/200/C60/Al were fabricated by Cheng et al.23 The RuII–trithiocyanate complex 200 (Fig. 51) was prepared from 133 in high yields and showed very broad absorption enabling the utilization of solar light in the near IR region. In comparison to a heterojunction PV device from ionic polythiophene and C60,523 here higher Isc values (2.58 vs. 0.97 mA cm−2) were observed, but the efficiency (∼0.12%) was limited by a lower Vsc (120 mV). This was attributed to the relatively high HOMO level of 200 resulting in a smaller gap between the donor HOMO and the acceptor LUMO. However, no improvement of the performance could be achieved by introducing an additional layer of PEDOT:PSS. Thus, the optimization of the device by both variation of the conjugated system and the use of different electron accepting layers is still required.

Polymer 201 (Fig. 51) with different m/n-ratios exhibited photo- and electroluminescence at room temperature. Photoconductivity measurements on spin-coated samples on ITO at 490 nm resulted in photoconductivities of the order of 10−12 Ω−1 cm−1. Polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDS) produced from the polymer (ITO/201/Al) gave a turn-on voltage of 5 V (rectification greater than 103 at 15 V) and a maximum luminance of 360 cd m−2.373
6. Conclusion
This review provides an overview of recent advances in the field of π-conjugated terpyridines. Following a chapter about the basic synthetic strategies towards terpyridines in general, we intended to give a classification into mono-, bis- as well as star-shaped oligonuclear terpyridines and to describe their synthesis and properties. The main part of this review deals with the synthesis, characterization and application of metallopolymers, prepared using π-conjugated bisterpyridines. Depending on the targeted properties of the material, a wide range of metal ions can be used for the self-assembly. Most transition metal ions as well as rare earth metals can be coordinated reversibly by 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine and structurally related ligand systems. Besides metallopolymers derived from monodisperse building blocks, also supramolecular materials based on terpyridine-containing π-conjugated polymers were presented and discussed. Additionally, an overview about star-shaped architectures as well as metallocycles, based on π-conjugated terpyridines, is given. This list proves already the diversity of structures that can be constructed using 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine binding units.
The development of supramolecular chemistry, in particular in the last decade, has paved the way to assemble small molecules by specific directed secondary interactions into polymeric architectures. These supramolecular polymers possess many of the valuable properties of conventional organic macromolecules, but the reversibility in bonding of these supramolecular polymers can additionally be utilized by adjusting the properties of such “living systems” by external stimuli. This dynamic nature allows adaptation of supramolecular architectures, for example in biological environments or as self-healing materials. Beyond this, the application of terpyridine-based architectures in opto-electronic devices, such as OLEDs or PV cells, is envisioned and promising initial results in this field have been reported.
However, the solubility of most presented systems is not yet sufficient for an easy processability, thus limiting the applicability in the solid state. Furthermore, for the development of high-end applications, it is essential to gain a deep understanding of the materials properties and, therefore, it is highly desirable to unite the disciplines of organic and polymer chemistry as well as physics and material science. If these barriers are ironed out, the unique properties of 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine containing systems can lead to broad applicable functional materials.
