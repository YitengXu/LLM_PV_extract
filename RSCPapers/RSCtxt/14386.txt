    , Accepted 19th March 2017First published on 28th March 2017AbstractNanowire quantum dots (NW-QDs) can be used for future compact and efficient optoelectronic devices. Many efforts have been made to control the QD states by inserting the QDs in doped structures and applying an electric field in a nanowire system. In this paper, we use down-conversion and up-conversion photoluminescence excitations to explore the optical and electronic properties of single quantum dots in GaAs/AlGaAs core–shell nanowires. We investigate a large optical Stark shift in this system as a new method to tune the QD states. When the tunable laser lies within the spectral bandwidth of ZB/WZ GaAs (780 nm–860 nm), we observe an extremely large optical Stark shift of 1.3 nm (0.5 nm) with increasing excitation power at a resonant wavelength of 800 nm (840 nm) in GaAs states. The ability to in situ control the energy states of self-catalyzed NW-QDs should open a new way for quantum light sources and nonlinear optics in a nanowire system.
The strong quantization in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) makes them of great interest for optoelectronic devices in manifold areas, such as low-threshold lasers,1 solar cells,2 light-emitting diodes,3 photodetectors,4 ultra-bright quantum light sources,5–7 single-spin optical manipulation,8etc. Nanowire quantum dots (NW-QDs) offer additional functionalities over self-assembled QDs since they are embedded in a one-dimensional nanowire system which acts as a perfect cavity to enhance the emission rate and collection efficiency of QDs.6,9–11 To fully explore the potential of NW-QD systems, many efforts have been made to control the QD states by inserting the QDs into doped structures and applying an electric field.12,13 However, achieving the exact electron/hole modulation in self-catalyzed nanowires is particularly challenging because of the extreme sensitivity of the doping condition due to its natural vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) mechanism14 and the difficulties in passivation, determined transferring, and connecting in such small-dimension wires.15,16 The ability to in situ control the energy states of self-catalyzed NW-QDs should open a wide range of new science, new technologies, and applications.
The employed NW-QDs often rely on inserting a slice of a lower gap semiconductor along the axial or radial directions, such as InAs/GaAs,17,18 GaAsP/GaAs,19 InAsP/InP20 and GaAs/AlGaAs21–23 systems. In most cases, QDs form the lowest energy states of a given system, that is, charge carriers excited nonresonantly in a continuum of states (e.g., the wetting layer for Stranski–Krastanov QDs) relax via phonon emission toward the QDs. However, there is a striking contrast for GaAs QDs on the facet of GaAs/AlGaAs core–shell nanowires. The QD states lie hundreds of meV above the minimum of a continuum of states and yet give rise to intense light emission at low temperatures.24–28 These QDs have been reported in the GaAs/AlGaAs nanowire structure: for example, from local AlGaAs alloy fluctuations,28 Stranski–Krastinow-like strained growths along the AlGaAs facets,27 a different band alignment of a zincblende (ZB)/wurtzite (WZ) crystal phase interface,29 or Ga-rich inclusions that form spontaneously at the apex of a GaAs/AlGaAs interface.24 The correlation between nanoscale composition modulation and optical properties of these QDs is intensively studied.30 However, the interaction between QD carriers and the continuum GaAs/AlGaAs states is still puzzling and without direct and tangible proof. Nari Jeon et al.31 proposed quantum tunneling coupling between QDs and from QDs to the GaAs core that may lead to the broadening of the PL spectrum. Pierre Corfdir et al.32 reported the transfer of carriers from the shell to the core of the nanowires at high temperature. Bekele H. Badada et al.33 demonstrated electrical Stark effect shifts in the sharp emission lines of excitons localized to quantum dot-like states. These results truly enlighten us to tune the QD states by coupling them to the GaAs/AlGaAs nanowire states using an in situ up-conversion photoluminescence resonant excitation method.
In this paper, we used down-conversion and up-conversion photoluminescence excitations to explore the optical and electronic properties of single quantum dots in GaAs/AlGaAs core–shell nanowires. We investigated the large optical Stark shift in this system as a new method to tune the QD states. When the tunable excitation laser lies within the spectral bandwidth of ZB/WZ GaAs (780 nm–860 nm), we observed an extremely large optical Stark shift of 1.3 nm (0.5 nm) with the increasing excitation power at a resonant wavelength of 800 nm (840 nm). We propose that the transfer dynamics originates from the interaction between the localized electrical field in continuum ZB/WZ GaAs states and the QD carrier fluxes. The large optical Stark shifts demonstrated here provide a useful method for in situ control of the energy states of self-catalyzed NW-QDs. They also provide an interesting approach for performing nonlinear spectroscopy on single QDs in a nanowire system.
Our investigated NW structures were synthesized on the GaAs (001) substrate in a solid-source MBE system, employing the self-catalyzed VLS mechanism.34 The structure consists of a Ga-assisted GaAs core, and low density of GaAs QDs sandwiched in two AlxGa1−xAs barrier layers. The aluminum composition is about 70% (x ∼ 0.7) which was determined by the Raman spectrum (Fig. S1†) and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images (Fig. S2) in the ESI.†Fig. 1a exemplifies the representative top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the obtained nanowire, with a perfect hexagonal {110} cross-section and a typical diameter of 480 nm (upper-right inset of Fig. 1a). The self-assembled QDs nucleate, as designed, on the facet or at the ridge of the hexagonal nanowire (i.e., on the apex between two adjacent {110} facets). These self-assembled GaAs QDs sandwiched between two AlGaAs barrier shells can efficiently generate bright single-photons (with a megahertz count rate) at liquid nitrogen temperature and can be easily coupled into the photonic modes of the hexagonal nanowire, as reported in our previous work.27

(b) Schematic sketch of the experimental setup for down-conversion and up-conversion photoluminescence measurements on a single quantum dot in GaAs/AlGaAs NWs. (c) A CCD image of dry-transferred GaAs/AlGaAs NWs on a patterned Si/SiO2 substrate. The bottom-right inset is a CCD image of the GaAs NW with the pumping laser spot. 
The nanowires were subsequently dry-transferred onto a patterned Si/SiO2 substrate and inserted into an optical microscopy cryostat (Montana, T = 4 K–300 K) for optical characterization. The experimental set-up is depicted schematically as shown in Fig. 1b. A mode-locked Ti-sapphire femtosecond laser system with tunable wavelengths from 750 nm to 1040 nm and a repetition rate of 79.3 MHz is used to excite the NW-QDs through a two-photon induced process, while the laser at a wavelength of 1024 nm is coupled to a Barium-Borate (BBO) crystal to produce a 512 nm pulsed laser for the above-band excitation of the QDs. The laser beam was focused onto the individually selected nanowire using a 50×/0.5 NA microscope objective with the laser spot of ∼1.5 μm, as shown in the bottom-right inset of Fig. 1c. The PL emission was excited and collected through the same objective which was further imported to a silicon charge coupled detector (CCD) or spectrometer.

Fig. 2(a) shows the typical micro-PL spectrum of NW-QDs tested at 4 K and down-conversion excitation using the above-mentioned 512 nm pulsed laser. GaAs NW emission presents a broadband spectrum from 790 nm to 875 nm, which is believed to arise from the type-II quantum discs because of the ZB/WZ crystal structure alternation.32,35,36 Besides, we find split peaks at the high energy side ranging from 600 to 770 nm which are assigned to different GaAs QDs decorated on the facets of the NW. The maximum emission is centered at 674.4 nm with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 163.9 μeV, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b). The linewidth is much broader than those of conventional self-assembled single QDs (∼4 μeV at 4 K), which is likely due to the spectral diffusion caused by surface-state-induced fluctuating charge distribution and defect states in the vicinity of QD-in-nanowires.37 The assignment of the emission line is based on the analysis of the dependence of integrated intensity with excitation power: I ∝ Pn. We assign P = 0.98 to single excitonic (X) emission, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Considering that Al0.7Ga0.3As shells with x ∼ 0.7 have a bandgap of EAlGaAsg = 2.37 eV,38 the bandgap of the ZB/WZ GaAs NW is in the range of EGaAsg = 1.42–1.57 eV, and the QD states lie hundreds of meV (1.61–2.06 eV) above the minimum of a continuum of GaAs states, we plot the conduction band (Ec) and valence band (Ev) along the radial direction for the GaAs QDs in the GaAs/AlGaAs core–shell NW structure. As shown in Fig. 2(c), there are three channels for carrier relaxation when using 512 nm down-conversion excitation (red solid line): relaxing along the GaAs NW; relaxing for radiative recombination of QDs; relaxing to some resonant levels of GaAs and tunneling into the QDs (red dotted lines). Note that the thickness of the AlGaAs shell is larger than 50 nm (Fig. S2†) and the high aluminum composition of 70%, the tunneling-based emission can be excluded in our system.39

The red and green lines represent down-conversion and up-conversion excitation and carrier relaxation processes, respectively. 
To gain more insight into how the GaAs continuum states affect the QD emission, we performed up-conversion micro-PL measurements of this single QD-in-NW system. As shown in Fig. 3a (detailed PL spectra in Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†), when pumping at different excitation wavelengths from 780 nm to 1040 nm, the second harmonic generation (SHG) from the NW and two photon induced luminescence (TPL) from the QD are simultaneously present. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the second and third order nonlinear optics (SHG and TPL) in a single QD-in-NW system. The SHG signal spectra are exactly the frequency doubling signals of the pumping laser. Fig. 2b shows the signal intensities of the SHG and TPL as a function of the pumping laser power. The quadratic dependency of the SHG indicates that the signal is generated from a second-order nonlinear process.40 The power-dependence of the TPL can be classified into two regimes: the slopes in the range of 1.2–1.5 are found at excitation wavelengths below 880 nm, according to one or two-photon nonlinear processes, while the slopes are large than 2.0 at excitation wavelengths above 880 nm, according to two or three-photon nonlinear processes.41 It should be noted that the intensities and the linewidths (Fig. S4,† using a 900 nm pulsed laser) are comparable with that pumped at 512 nm, indicating up-conversion excitation also as a potential method for tunable single photon generation. Power-dependent QD emissions at four typical excitation wavelengths of (1) 820 nm, (2) 840 nm, (3) 880 nm, and (4) 1020 nm are shown in Fig. 3(c), with the slopes of P = 1.67, 1.29, 2.52, and 2.72, respectively. For low excitation power, the main PL peak in Fig. 4 (also in Fig. S4†) is attributed to the exciton (X). Further increase of the excitation power results in state-filling related emissions (multi-excitons) appearing at the high energy side of the ground-state. Then the intensity of the exciton saturates and eventually decreases (excitation wavelengths of 800 nm and 840 nm). The broad and closely situated levels at high enough optical excitation may be populated by carriers from related continuum states.42

(b) The SHG and QD signal intensities as a function of the pumping laser power at different excitation wavelengths. (c) Power-dependent QD emission at four typical excitation wavelengths of (1) 820 nm, (2) 840 nm, (3) 880 nm, and (4) 1020 nm, with the slopes of P = 1.74, 1.29, 2.52, and 2.72, respectively.

To reveal the origin of these continuum states and characterize the carrier relaxation processes of the QD in GaAs/AlGaAs NWs, typical power dependence of the measured QD spectra are shown in Fig. 4(a). The QD emission wavelength shows a red-shift with increasing excitation power when the tunable laser lies within the spectral bandwidth of ZB/WZ GaAs (780 nm–860 nm), while it remains static at the excitation wavelengths of 512 nm and 880 nm. Thus the heating effects at high excitation power can be excluded here. The maximum measured shift is 1.3 nm (0.5 nm) at the excitation wavelength of 800 nm (840 nm), which agrees well with the two major luminescence peaks of GaAs as shown in Fig. 2a. The solid lines in Fig. 5a represent linear fits to the QD emission energy as a function of the power. From the slopes of the fits (Fig. 5b), the Stark shift rates are determined to be 1.98 eV W−1 and 0.58 eV W−1 for 800 nm and 840 nm, respectively.

We now utilize the two phenomena we have observed, namely the two-photon induced photoluminescence of single QDs in a nanowire and the Stark shift of the QD emission when resonantly pumping the GaAs/AlGaAs NW, to provide insight into the transfer dynamics in the QD states coupled to GaAs/AlGaAs nanowires. The large Stark shifts observed indicate an enhanced interplay between ZB/WZ GaAs continuum states and QD carrier fluxes. As shown in Fig. 2c, there are two channels for carrier relaxation when using up-conversion excitation (green solid line): resonantly relaxing along the GaAs NWs and relaxing through a two photon process for the radiative recombination of QDs (green dotted lines). Based on the aforementioned down-conversion and up-conversion photoluminescence results, we propose that the Stark shift originates from the localized electric field in the ZB/WZ GaAs/AlGaAs nanowire states such as the electron–hole droplets formed at sufficiently high excitation density (resonant excitation).43
In summary, we have systematically studied the optical and electronic properties of single quantum dots in GaAs/AlGaAs core–shell nanowires with both down-conversion and up-conversion photoluminescence measurements. Our results reveal an extremely large optical Stark shift in this system when the tunable laser lies within the spectral bandwidth of ZB/WZ GaAs (780 nm−860 nm). A maximum red shift of 1.3 nm (0.5 nm) with the increasing excitation power at a resonant wavelength of 800 nm (840 nm) is achieved. We propose that the transfer dynamics originates from the interplay between the localized electrical field in continuum ZB/WZ GaAs states and the QD carrier fluxes. This work paves the way forward for performing nonlinear spectroscopy on single QDs in a nanowire system, and for in situ control of the energy states of self-catalyzed NW-QDs.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Typical SEM top-view image of GaAs–AlGaAs core–shell NWs, where the upper-right inset shows a magnified image of the hexagonal top of a NW. (b) Schematic sketch of the experimental setup for down-conversion and up-conversion photoluminescence measurements on a single quantum dot in GaAs/AlGaAs NWs. (c) A CCD image of dry-transferred GaAs/AlGaAs NWs on a patterned Si/SiO2 substrate. The bottom-right inset is a CCD image of the GaAs NW with the pumping laser spot.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) A typical micro-PL spectrum of the GaAs/AlGaAs nanowire system ranging from 600 nm to 900 nm at the above-band excitation of 512 nm. (b) The excitation-dependent micro-PL spectrum of a typical QD emitted at 674.4 nm. Inset is the micro-PL spectrum of the QD with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 163.9 μeV. (c) Energy-band structures of the QD-in-NW system discussed in the text. The red and green lines represent down-conversion and up-conversion excitation and carrier relaxation processes, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Spectra of the SHG signals and QD signals at different excitation wavelengths from 800 nm to 1040 nm. (b) The SHG and QD signal intensities as a function of the pumping laser power at different excitation wavelengths. (c) Power-dependent QD emission at four typical excitation wavelengths of (1) 820 nm, (2) 840 nm, (3) 880 nm, and (4) 1020 nm, with the slopes of P = 1.74, 1.29, 2.52, and 2.72, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  Power dependence of the QD emission at up-conversion excitation using different wavelengths of 780 nm, 800 nm, 820 nm, 840 nm, 860 nm and 880 nm, compared with that excited at 512 nm.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) The shift of the QD emission energies as a function of the excitation power. (b) The slopes of linear fits to the QD emission energies as a function of the power.
