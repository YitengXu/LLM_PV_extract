    , Accepted 20th August 2021First published on 20th August 2021AbstractSpontaneous flexoelectricity in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanotubes is critical to the design of new energy devices. However, the electronic properties adjusted by the flexoelectric effect in TMD nanotubes remain vague. In this work, we investigate the effect of flexoelectricity on band engineering in single- and double-wall MS2 (M = Mo, W) nanotubes with different diameters based on first-principles calculations and an atomic-bond-relaxation method. We find that the energy bandgap reduces and the polarization and flexoelectric voltage increase with decreasing diameter of single-wall MS2 nanotubes. The polarization charges promoted by the flexoelectric effect can lead to a straddling-to-staggered bandgap transition in the double-wall MS2 nanotubes. The critical diameters for bandgap transition are about 3.1 and 3.6 nm for double-wall MoS2 and WS2 nanotubes, respectively, which is independent of chirality. Our results provide guidance for the design of new energy devices based on spontaneous flexoelectricity.
1. Introduction
The electromechanical coupling in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs) is an important route to promote miniaturization and diversification of devices, and has been extensively applied in transistors,1 photodetectors,2 and energy harvesting devices,3etc. Moreover, 2D-TMDs have a suitable bandgap and flexible mechanical properties, making themself promising candidates for future high-end electromechanical coupling materials.4–6 Among them, the strain-induced polarization has a great influence on the electronic properties, which plays a crucial role in the generation of charges and related performances of devices.3 However, piezoelectricity only exists in non-centrosymmetric crystalline materials, and the polarization strongly depends on the external strain, limiting the applications for possible materials.3 Therefore, it is significant to research semiconductor materials with spontaneous polarization performances for the design of new energy devices.
Moreover, the coupling of spontaneous polarization and electronic properties can trigger the unique bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in ferroelectric materials, which allows their charge transport properties to be modified, and makes the power conversion efficiency free from the Shockley–Queisser limit.7,8 However, the ferroelectric materials have a wide bandgap, resulting in a low conversion efficiency. For the cases of TMD nanotubes (NTs), there are two unique advantages, including suitable bandgap in the visible light range and spontaneous flexoelectricity,9–12i.e., the coupling between the strain gradient and polarization, which can be widely realized in semiconductors. Very recently, a strong BPVE was found in WS2-NTs, and its photocurrent density is orders of magnitude larger than that of other BPVE materials.13 Also, the staggered band alignment initiated by a flexoelectric effect in double-wall (DW) carbon NTs has been reported for the first time by using first-principles calculations, the related achievement is of pioneering significance for the active medium for photovoltaic charge separation.14 Additionally, the electronic properties of single-wall (SW) TMD-NTs rely upon the choice of chirality and diameter.9,10,15–19
Although these solid out-of-plane flexoelectric effects have been observed in monolayer TMDs,11,12,20–22 the influence on the electronic properties of TMD-NTs and implications for device applications have not been investigated thus far. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to explore the coupling of spontaneous flexoelectricity and electronic properties in TMD-NTs. In particular, there are some fundamental problems that need to be solved urgently: how does the flexoelectric voltage affect the band evolution and related band alignment in TMD-NTs with different diameters? Is the large photocurrent generation in TMD-NTs promoted by the flexoelectric effect?
Therefore, in this contribution, we investigate the coupling between flexoelectricity and electronic properties of SW and DW MS2 (M = Mo, W)-NTs in terms of first-principles calculations and the atomic-bond-relaxation (ABR) method.23–25 First, we explore the diameter-dependent bandgap of SW MS2-NTs, and confirm that the bandgap diminishes with decreasing tube diameter.9,10,15–19 Second, we study the relationship between polarization and flexoelectric voltage of SW MS2-NTs with different diameters, and find that the flexoelectric voltage can be up to 0.7 V at the diameter of 1 nm. Our results show that the flexoelectricity can lead to a type I to type II transition in DW MS2-NTs, suggesting a new mechanism of charge collection or separation in TMD-NTs.
2. Principle
2.1. Band offset of SW MS2-NTs
Monolayer MS2 can be regarded as a kind of sandwiched structure where atoms are connected by strongly ionic-covalent bonds and each M atom of the hexagonal lattices is coordinated by six neighboring S atoms in a trigonal prismatic geometry. When a monolayer MS2 is rolled into an NT, the mirror symmetry is broken. Therefore, a linear distribution of strain is produced along the radial direction with zero strain at the neutral plane, and also the inner part shrinks and the outer part expands.26–28 Thus, the outer and inner parts have identical average strain, i.e., out = −in.27 The relationship between curvature and strain gradient can be shown as ∂εz/∂z = K, where K is the curvature of NT and z represents the radial direction.12 Then the average strain on the outer part of SW MS2-NTs is (1)where H is the thickness of monolayer MS2 and D is the tube diameter. Generally, the strain will lead to a system relaxing spontaneously to a new self-equilibrium state, resulting in the variation of bond identities, including bond length, bond angle and bond energy. Note that the interaction of M and S in SW MS2-NTs consists of bond-stretching energy Ubond, bond angle variation energy Uangle and Coulomb electrostatic energy Ucoul. Thus, we have29,30 (2)
Here,  is the Morse bond potential, where R and α are the empirical parameters.  is the Harmonic angle potential, where kθ and kψ are the bond-bending force constants.  is the Coulomb electrostatic potential, where C is the Coulomb electrostatic potential parameter.29,30hij is the distance between atoms i and j, h0 is the equilibrium bond length between atoms i and j, θ and ψ are the in-plane and out-of-plane bond angles, and qi and qj are the partial electrostatic charges for atoms i and j. Therefore, the variation of the average energy of the M–S bond induced by curvature is ΔE = −ΔU/n, where n is the number of bonds in a unit cell.
According to the ABR method,25,31 the single-body Hamiltonian is: , where Va(r) and Vc(r) are, respectively, the intra-atomic trapping potential of an isolated atom and the periodic potential of crystal, me is the effective mass of an electron and a is the lattice constant. Also, the bandgap between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band is from the crystal potential, the magnitude is approximately twice that of the first Fourier coefficients of potential energy function. Therefore, we find that the bandgap is proportional to the single bond energy, i.e., Eg = 2|V1| ∝ 〈E0〉, where , and 〈E0〉 is the average single bond energy.24,25 Any perturbation to the interatomic potential will change the entire band structure. Intrinsically, the cohesive energy of an isolated atom can be approached as the sum of its bond energy over all the nearest neighbors, that is, EC = ZEb, where EC and Eb denote the cohesive energy and single bond energy, respectively. Notably, Z = 4 are the coordination numbers (CNs) of SW MS2-NTs.25 For the case of SW MS2-NTs, the perturbation to the average cohesive energy can be divided into two contributions: one is from the spontaneous contraction of surface atoms caused by under-coordinated atoms, and the other is the strain induced by curvature. Thus, the cohesive energy for a SW MS2-NT can be obtained as EC(D) = NZ1(c1−mEb + ΔE), where N is the total number of atoms, and Z1 is the CNs of monolayer MS2, c1 = 2/(1 + exp((12 − Z1)/8Z1)) is the bond contraction coefficient, and m is the bond nature factor.25,31 Therefore, the diameter-dependent bandgap of SW MS2-NTs can be deduced as: (3)where , and Ebg is the bandgap of the bulk counterpart.
2.2. Flexoelectricity in SW MS2-NTs
In general, a NT can be obtained by rolling up a monolayer, which breaks the mirror symmetry and produces a strain gradient in the radial direction. Noticeably, the strain gradient in the radial direction will induce the cation atom to be squeezed out of its original position relative to the anion atom, resulting in an electric polarization in the radial direction.12,28 The polarization is given as , where μz is the flexoelectric coefficient. Meanwhile, the polarization along the radial direction is , where zi is the z-coordination of the i-th atom, and S is the area.32 Moreover, considering a sandwiched structure of SW MS2-NTs, the polarization can be rewritten as . For the case of SW MS2-NTs, a linear distribution of strain is produced along the radial direction, resulting in a generation of polarization in the radial direction and Pz = Pzinner−Pzouter, where Pzinner and Pzouter denote the polarization of the inner part and the outer parts, respectively. Moreover,  and . In our case, since the diameter of NTs is several orders of magnitude larger than the monolayer thickness, we obtain (2D − Hν‖)(2D + H) ≈ (2D + Hν‖)(2D − H). Therefore, the relationship between diameter and polarization in SW MS2-NTs is (4)where ν‖ and ν⊥ denote the in-plane and out-of-plane Poisson's ratio of monolayer MS2. For the case of SW MS2-NTs, the constitutive equation for the electric displacement Dz possessing flexoelectricity is32,33Dz = κ0Ez + Pz, where Ez is the electric field along the radial direction and κ0 is the vacuum permittivity. We assume that MS2-NTs are perfectly dielectric materials with no free charges. Under these circumstances, the electrostatic equilibrium condition is ∇·Dz = 0, resulting in a flexoelectric potential distribution in the SW MS2-NTs: , where κ is the dielectric constant. Through consideration of the boundary conditions φ(0) = 0 and Dz(±H/2) = 0, we obtain the flexoelectric voltage of SW MS2-NTs (5)
2.3. Band alignment in DW MS2-NTs
For a DW MS2-NT, the interior tube is composed of ionic-covalent bonds and its intertube is stacked with van der Waals (vdW) interaction. Therefore, the total energy of DW MS2-NTs can be divided into four contributions, i.e., Utotal = Uin + Uout + UvdW + Uintercoul, where Uin and Uout are the M–S potentials in the inner and outer tubes, UvdW and Uintercoul are the vdW interaction energy and the intertube Coulomb electrostatic energy, respectively. Also, the intertube Coulombic electrostatic energy can be neglected because this part is far weaker than that of the bond potential (S1, ESI†). Moreover, the vdW interaction energy can be expressed by the Lennard-Jones potential:34, where Γ and σ denote the depth of the energy well at the equilibrium separation and the zero-across distance of the potential, and rij is the intertube distance. Also, the vdW interaction between M–M and M–S is far weaker than that of two adjacent S–S, thus, we only need to consider the interaction of S–S in the adjacent wall. Furthermore, we address the vdW interaction energy of all the adjacent S atoms between the inner and outer tubes,35i.e., , where ρin and ρout are the number of atoms per unit area of inner and outer tubes, and Ain and Aout denote the area of inner and outer tubes, respectively. Thus, the average interaction energy can be obtained as34,36 (6)
In light of eqn (1)–(3) and (6), the bandgap of the inner and outer tubes can be given by Eing(Din) = Ebg(1 + ΔDin + ΔUinvdW/(3Z1)) and Eoutg(Dout) = Ebg(1 + ΔDout + ΔUoutvdW/(3Z1)), where Din and Dout represent the diameter of the inner and outer tubes, respectively, and ΔU(in)outvdW is the variation of average intertube vdW interaction energy. Furthermore, to gain insight into the band alignment of inner and outer tubes with different diameters, the band edge shifts are very important referential standards. Especially, taking into account the flexoelectric effect, the positive and negative charges at the inner and outer tubes can generate a charge depletion area, which is considered to have a cylinder profile.37,38 Moreover, the total polarization in DW MS2-NTs is Pztotal = Pzout + Pzin, where Pzout and Pzin are the polarization of outer and inner tubes. Therefore, the density of polarization charges in DW MS2-NTs is: qρflexWflex = −μz(1/Din + 1/Dout), where ρflex is the density of polarization charges, Wflex is the width of charge distribution, and q denotes the absolute value of the unit electronic charge.37,38 Here, the flexoelectric potential distribution can be calculated in terms of one-dimensional Poisson's equation, i.e., d2φi/dz2 = qρflex(z)/κ. Then, the potential distribution at different positions can be calculated as follows: (7)Also, the built-in potential is (8)Based on the principle of piezo-phototronic solar cells,37,38 the Fermi level EoutF of the outer tube and that of the inner tube EinF in the presence of flexoelectric voltage can be obtained: EoutF = EF0 + q2ρflexW2flex/(2κ) and EinF = EF0−q2ρflexW2flex/(2κ). Moreover, in terms of effective-mass approximation,39 the diameter-dependent shifts of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) are ΔECBM(Din(out)) = ħ2π2/(2meD2in(out)) and ΔEVBM(Din(out)) = ħ2π2/(2mhD2in(out)), where mh is the effective mass of a hole, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Consequently, combining with the relationship shown above, the diameter-dependent band edge shifts under flexoelectric voltage are (9)where χ is the electronic affinity of monolayer MS2. Notably, if EinCBM = EoutCBM, we can get the threshold value for the type I to type II transition in DW MS2-NTs.
2.4. Computational methods
Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)40 of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).41,42 For geometry relaxation, the lattice box of the NTs was fixed, and all the atoms were allowed to fully relax. The cutoff energy of 400 eV was set for the plane wave expansion. The convergence of energy was set to 10−6 eV and the force on each atom was less than 0.01 eV Å−1. The vacuum space between two adjacent NTs was set to at least 15 Å to eliminate the interactive effect on each other. The 1 × 1 × 11 Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid was used in the first Brillouin-zone for MoS2-NTs. The DFT-D343 functional correction was used for DW MoS2-NTs to describe the long-range vdW interaction.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Electronic structure of SW MS2-NTs
A SW-NT was formed by rolling up a monolayer nanosheet, just like the carbon analogues. The chiral vector  is: armchair NTs (n,n) and zigzag NTs (n,0), while the diameter of the transition-metal layer is . Two kinds of classic chiralities in SW MS2-NTs with armchair and zigzag types have been addressed in our case, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). When a monolayer MS2 is rolled into NT, the inner part shrinks and the outer part expands, and the positions of anion and cation atoms change relative to the original site, resulting in a polarization in the radial direction (Fig. 1(c)). Moreover, the lattice deformation of NT caused by the strain gradient will lead to the variations of bond lengths and bond angles (S2, S3 and Table S1, ESI†). Note that the necessary parameters in our calculations are listed in Table 1.

Fig. 2(a) shows the diameter-dependent strain energies of SW MS2-NTs. Clearly, the strain energies decrease nonlinearly with increasing tube diameter, following roughly a 1/D2 behavior, which is consistent with the prediction by the classical elasticity theory.19 Interestingly, the differences of strain energies between armchair and zigzag NTs are slight at a given diameter. Comparing with MoS2-NTs and WS2-NTs, we find that the strain energies of WS2-NTs are slightly more favorable than that of MoS2-NTs at a fixed size. The discrepancy of strain energy mainly comes from the electrostatic interaction because of different Born effective charges.44 Furthermore, the strain gradient can lead to lattice distortion and induce lattice periodic potential deviating from the case of the monolayer, resulting in the change in bandgap.

The bandgap of SW MS2-NTs as a function of tube diameter is exhibited in Fig. 2(b), and the results of DFT calculations are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). Meanwhile, the bandgaps of monolayer MoS2 and WS2 are also calculated by DFT (S4, ESI†). Obviously, the bandgap of SW MS2-NTs increases with increasing tube diameter, and the limit is the bandgap of the monolayer. For a given tube diameter, the bandgaps of zigzag and armchair NTs are close to each other. Moreover, the SW armchair MoS2-NTs is an indirect bandgap with their VBM and CBM both located at the middle of Γ and Z high symmetry points, whereas the SW zigzag MoS2-NTs have a direct bandgap at the Γ point (Fig. 2(c) and (d)). Similar results have been obtained by Xiao et al.,10 Milošević et al.15 and Zibouche et al.16 As in the cases of SW armchair and zigzag MoS2-NTs, the major contributions of CBM are Mo-dx2, Mo-dxy and Mo-dz2, but the VBM are mainly composed of Mo-dx2, Mo -dxy and Mo-dz2 with a weak distribution from S-px and S-py (S5, ESI†). Moreover, the electron states of armchair and zigzag WS2-NTs near the CBM and VBM are from the contribution of W-dz2 orbitals, which is independent of chirality.19 In addition, the phonon dispersion of SW MoS2-NTs does not have negative frequencies in the Brillouin zone, suggesting the the NTs are dynamically stable (S6, ESI†). Moreover, a large number of multi- and single-wall TMD-NTs have been synthesized in experiments.45–47 Also, the phonon dispersion of SW MS2-NTs does not have imaginary phonon frequencies by first-principles calculations, indicating that these tubes can also exist stably.19
3.2. Flexoelectric properties of SW MS2-NTs
In terms of Eqn (4), we investigated the polarization properties of SW MS2-NTs with different diameters. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the polarization increases as the curvature enhances and the system exhibits a linear relationship between polarization and curvature. Moreover, similar results have been obtained from the DFT calculations (S7, ESI†). In fact, the NTs along the radial direction will produce a strain gradient, and the center of metal ions drifts away from its original position, resulting in the polarization (Fig. 1(c)). Meanwhile, asymmetric charge distribution also occurs (S8 and Table S1, ESI†). Moreover, the difference in polarization between the inner and outer parts significantly increases with the decrease of tube diameter. Importantly, a large strain gradient (105–107 m−1) along the radial direction can be generated in the NTs, resulting in a giant flexoelectric polarization comparable to or even higher than the ferroelectric/piezoelectric polarization.48–50 In our case, the flexoelectric coefficients of SW MS2-NTs are obtained by the slope of the function of polarization and curvature. Obviously, the flexoelectric coefficients are 0.031 and 0.015 nC m−1 for the SW MoS2- and WS2-NTs, respectively, which are on the same order as the experimental measurements and theoretical calculations.11,12,51 Interestingly, owing to a larger Born effective charge for MoS2 compared to WS2,44 the flexoelectric coefficient of MoS2 is two times larger than that of WS2. Similarly, Zhuang et al.12 found that the bending of monolayer MoS2 will induce polarization by means of atomistic simulations, and the results are shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a). Bennett52 reported that the radial polarization of TMD-NTs increases with the decrease of tube diameter in terms of ab initio calculations. However, a finite polarization is shown when D > 10 Å and a maximum around ∼15 Å. This behavior may arise from the variation of bond strain, but did not explain the peculiar size dependence.52

(b) Curvature induced flexoelectric voltage of SW MS2-NTs as a function of tube diameter. The inset corresponds to the schematic of the bent membrane and the relationship between curvature and diameter. 
In addition, strain gradient will lead to the displacement between cations and anions, and then generate a flexoelectric voltage on the exterior and inner channels. As shown in Fig. 3(b), we find that the flexoelectric voltage in SW MS2-NTs increases with the decrease of tube diameter, and follows the relation Vflex = V0/D, where V0 is a constant determined by the flexoelectric polarizability. In our case, we obtain V0 that are 7.5 V Å−1 and 3.4 V Å−1 for SW MoS2- and WS2-NTs, respectively, which are comparable to that of fullerenes and larger than that of carbon NTs.14 Notably, V0 for MoS2-NTs is larger than that for WS2-NTs, inferring that MoS2-NTs have a significantly higher polarizability (Fig. 3(a)). Specifically, although small diameter tubes correspond to strong flexoelectric properties, to date only larger diameter tubes were synthesized, while it is hopeful that smaller diameters will be obtained in the future.
3.3. Band offset and alignment of DW MS2-NTs

Fig. 4 exhibits the band alignment of inner and outer tubes in DW MS2-NTs with different diameters. In DW MS2-NTs, the intertube distance is ∼3.44 Å for all accessible diameter values in our case (S9, ESI†), which is in agreement with the DFT calculations and experimental measurements.53,54 Note that we estimate ΔUin(out)vdW = 0.2 eV per atom for the intertube interaction.
 Fig. 4  (a–c) DW armchair MoS2-NTs with different diameters are calculated by DFT, where the band decomposed charge density indicates that the CBM states are always localized at the inner tube and the VBM states gradually shift from the inner to the outer as the diameter increases. (b–g) The VBM and CBM positions and band alignments of the armchair and zigzag MS2 inner and outer tubes are our theoretical predications. The vacuum level is taken as the zero energy reference. 
Furthermore, we calculate the bandgaps of two isolated tubes in the DW MS2-NTs. Notably, these two isolated tubes can be regarded as two kinds of units, yielding type I band alignment (S10, ESI†). When considering the inner and outer tubes as a whole, the positive and negative charges are created at the inner and outer tubes, which can significantly modulate the band structure. The positive polarization charges will reduce the energy level of both valence and conduction bands, and the energy level of the outer tube will be enhanced by the negative polarization charges, resulting in a type II band alignment with VBM on the outer tube and CBM on the inner tube. Notably, the threshold diameters of DW MoS2- and WS2-NTs are about 3.1 and 3.6 nm, respectively, while the threshold is independent of the chirality. Further DFT calculations can demonstrate this transition trend of DW armchair MoS2-NTs from type I to type II band alignment (Fig. 4(a)–(c)). Similarly, the transition trend of band alignment in DW zigzag MoS2-NTs is consistent with the change of DW armchair MoS2-NTs (S11, ESI†). The difference of threshold diameter of two kinds of NTs can be attributed to the fact that MoS2-NTs have a larger flexoelectric voltage relative to WS2-NTs. Besides, there is charge transfer between the outer and inner tubes due to intertube orbital hybridization interactions, resulting in the partially enlarged flexoelectric voltage effect on the band edge positions. However, considering the weak intertube interactions of DW MS2-NTs, the electrostatic potential induced by charge transfer can be regarded as a correction of flexoelectric voltage (S12, ESI†).9,12,14 Thus, only the flexoelectric voltage is considered in our calculation. Interestingly, for the cases of DW MSe2-NTs, the flexoelectric effect can also induce the band alignment transition and the threshold diameters of DW MoSe2- and WSe2-NTs to be about 2.8 and 3.3 nm, respectively. Moreover, the threshold diameters of DW MoSe2-NTs (WSe2-NTs) are smaller than those of MoS2-NTs (WS2-NTs) due to the larger flexoelectric voltage of MoSe2-NTs (WSe2-NTs). However, as the MTe2-NTs are metallic states, the band alignment transition is absent (S13, ESI†). Consequently, the flexoelectric effect in MS2- and MSe2-NTs will induce the spontaneous collection or separation of charge carriers. Similarly, using DFT calculations, Artyukhov et al.14 demonstrated that the flexoelectricity can cause a straddling to staggered bandgap transition in DW carbon NTs, and estimated a critical diameter of ∼2.4 nm. In addition, the phenomenon of separation or collection of charge carriers in an initially homogeneous material is not entirely new,9,55–57 and has been demonstrated experimentally and theoretically in some nanostructures with graded gaps55–58 and polarization.59 However, compared with the cases under the condition of strain modulation, the separation or collection of charge carriers induced by a spontaneous flexoelectric effect has obvious advantages, such as easier achievement and more stability.
3.4. Charge extraction in DW MS2-NTs
The schematic diagram of photogenerated electron–hole pair transfer is given in Fig. 5, which provides a basic physical picture to understand the mechanism of carrier behavior from band alignment. In detail, Fig. 5(a) shows the bandgap of two individual tubes. The bandgap of the outer tube is larger than that of the inner tube due to the difference of their diameter. However, the polarization charges will induce the shifts of VBM and CBM, while decreasing the diameter of NT can lead to a decrease of bandgap and an increase of flexoelectric voltage. In the case of small diameter DW MS2-NTs, both VBM and CBM are located at the inner tube, resulting in the collection of photoexcited electrons and holes at the inner tube, which can be used as light-emitting devices (Fig. 5(b)). However, with the increase of diameter of DW MS2-NTs, the flexoelectric voltage can induce a type II band alignment with the VBM at the outer tube and the CBM at the inner tube (Fig. 5(c)). Therefore, electron–hole pairs will be separated by a built-in electric field and move in the opposite direction, suggesting that this kind of structure can be potentially used in new types of photovoltaic devices.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we investigated the band engineering, the flexoelectricity, and the coupling between each other for SW and DW MS2-NTs with different diameters in terms of first-principles calculations and an ABR mechanism. We find that the bandgap of SW MS2-NTs shows a red-shift, while the polarization and flexoelectric voltage significantly increase with diminishing tube diameter. Moreover, the polarization and flexoelectric voltage of SW MoS2-NTs are two times higher than that of SW WS2-NTs when the diameter is fixed because of the smaller Born effective charge in WS2. For DW MS2-NTs, the flexoelectric effect induced by curvature can modify the position of the band edge and thereby result in a band alignment transition from type I to type II. The threshold diameter is 3.1 and 3.6 nm for DW MoS2- and WS2-NTs, respectively, independent of chirality. Our results provide theoretical guidance for the application of TMD-NTs with different diameters, and create opportunities for the design of novel devices based on spontaneous flexoelectricity.

 	Fig. 2  Diameter-dependent strain energy (a) and bandgap (b) of SW MS2-NTs. Band structures of MoS2-NTs with different diameters in armchair (c) and zigzag (d) edges. The Fermi level is set to zero. The lines correspond to the results of our predictions.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Polarization Pz of SW MS2-NTs as a function of curvature. The inset is the curvature-dependent polarization of SW MoS2-NTs. (b) Curvature induced flexoelectric voltage of SW MS2-NTs as a function of tube diameter. The inset corresponds to the schematic of the bent membrane and the relationship between curvature and diameter.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a–c) DW armchair MoS2-NTs with different diameters are calculated by DFT, where the band decomposed charge density indicates that the CBM states are always localized at the inner tube and the VBM states gradually shift from the inner to the outer as the diameter increases. (b–g) The VBM and CBM positions and band alignments of the armchair and zigzag MS2 inner and outer tubes are our theoretical predications. The vacuum level is taken as the zero energy reference.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) The bandgaps of individual isolated tubes in DW MS2-NTs. (b–c) Two charge extraction mechanisms arising from different band alignment in DW MS2-NTs.
