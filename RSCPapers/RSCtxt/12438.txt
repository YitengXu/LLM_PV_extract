Their thermotropic behaviour is a result of the strong π–π association between FHBC units while the DPP unit enhances light absorption. With small changes in the molecular structure, significant differences in molecular organisation were observed in solid state. In turn, the molecular arrangement led to variations in the semiconducting properties of these materials and, ultimately, their performance in organic solar cells.
Introduction
The primary function and properties of organic semiconducting materials are determined by the ability of the materials to transport charges, holes or electrons. Varying degrees of charge mobility are required for different types of applications including organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), solar cells (OSCs) and field effect transistors (OFETs). For bulk heterojunction OSCs, a moderate level of charge mobility is sufficient for device operation with performance being more dependent on light absorption, efficient charge separation and balanced transport of holes and electrons in the active layer.1 While the light absorption of an organic material can be tuned with relative ease through molecular structure modifications such as the incorporation of dyes, predicting the bulk material properties can be challenging particularly in bulk heterojunctions (BHJs). In BHJ devices, the active layer consists of a blend of electron donor and electron acceptor materials which enables the transport of holes and electrons respectively.1,2 Various degrees of phase separation between the donors and acceptors will occur depending on the association energy of the materials, solvents, additives and other processing conditions.3 In the ideal BHJ solar cell, the active layer consists of a bi-continuous interpenetrating network of donors and acceptors with phase domains in the range of 10 to 20 nm width.4 Polymer donor and fullerene acceptor blends are currently the most popular combination with state-of-the-art device efficiency of over 8%.1,5 Interestingly, there have been an increasing number of reports on small molecule donor and fullerene acceptor blends6–9 with power conversion efficiency as high as 6.7% reported recently.10 Small molecule dyes are often more simple to synthesize and purify compared to polymers and can lead to more reliable devices with no batch to batch variability. However, a large portion of small molecule dyes suffer from low charge mobility and an ideal BHJ morphology is not easily obtained. In this study, hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC) with thienyl diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) dye attached to its periphery was investigated as a self-organizing electron donor component in combination with fullerenes for BHJ solar cells.
HBC is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of thirteen fused six membered rings.11,12 HBC and its derivatives have been shown to form mesophases and to self-assemble into columnar structures giving rise to macroscopic nanotube structures as well as ordered morphology in films.13 As a result of the strong π–π intermolecular association, local charge mobility as high as 5 cm2 V−1 s−1 has been estimated.14 A long range order can also be achieved by alignment of the HBC molecules with the reported OFET mobility of 5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.15 The columnar assembly of HBC molecules makes them particularly interesting for OSC devices and some have shown promise in early reports.16,17 A large portion of HBC derivatives rely on alkyl chains on their periphery for solubility, which limits the potential for further functionalization.11,13 In addition, peripheral alkyl chains adversely affect intercolumnar charge mobility leading to poor bulk charge transport properties.13 More recently, our group has developed a class of highly soluble easily functionalized HBC building blocks carrying conjugated substituents.18 The primary challenge in the synthesis of these systems is the incorporation of conjugated substituents as well as alkyl groups for solubility. The 9,9-dioctylfluorenyl hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (FHBC) moiety has emerged as a material with excellent solubility and the potential for further derivatization.19 A large variety of functional groups has been attached to the FHBC core including triarylamine oligomers,19 thiophene dendrons,20,21 porphyrins,22 fullerenes23 and other small molecule dyes.24
Organic solar cell materials based on the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) unit have been the subject of a number of publications in recent years.6 In particular, the combination of donor thiophene substituents with the acceptor DPP unit has led to both polymer and small molecule materials with broadened absorption in the visible to near-infrared range.7 While a power conversion efficiency of over 4% has been reported for devices containing DPP,25 both solar cell device characteristics (fill factor < 50%) and mobility measurements (μhole ∼ 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) indicate that a better device performance is possible if charge transport in these materials improves. One recent study made use of pyrene substituents to improve the crystallinity of diketopyrrolopyrrole dyes in order to improve bulk charge transport and device performance.26 By using the self-organizing FHBC core as a scaffold for the DPP dye unit, the hybrid material will retain good light absorption properties with added charge transport capability. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of three FHBC–DPP dyes. The self-assembling properties of these dyes are investigated in solution and in the solid state. The mobility, both OFET and space-charge limited current (SCLC), of the materials were measured and the performance of the materials in BHJ solar cells were examined.
Synthesis and characterisation
Fluorenyl hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (FHBC) diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) organic dye 5 was obtained in 72% yield from the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling of FHBC boronic acid pinacol ester derivative 1 (ref. 22) with commercially available DPP precursor 2 (Scheme 1). Dyes 6 and 7 capped with benzothiophene and benzofuran respectively were also obtained from DPP precursor 2. DPP derivatives 3 and 4 were prepared by Suzuki–Miyaura coupling of precursor 2 with 2-benzothiopheneboronic acid and 2-benzofuranboronic acid, respectively, followed by bromination (Scheme 1, see ESI† for experimental details). It is interesting to note that both compounds 3 and 4 were brominated in two positions on the molecules. The 3-positions on the benzothiophene and the benzofuran were readily brominated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) at 0 °C. By adding a second equivalent of NBS, dibromo derivatives 3 and 4 were isolated in high yield (see ESI† for detailed bromination experiment). Interestingly, the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling of FHBC boronic acid pinacol ester derivative 1 with derivatives 3 and 4 gave, in one step, dyes 6 and 7 respectively in good yield with only small quantities of oligomeric by-products observed (Scheme 1). It was found that the sterically hindered 3-bromo group of benzothiophene and benzofuran readily underwent palladium-catalysed de-bromination with ethanol as the hydrogen source (see ESI† for de-bromination experiments).27 The more accessible 5-bromo group on the thiophene of compounds 3 and 4 participated in the desired Suzuki–Miyaura reaction to give dyes 6 and 7.

The FHBC–DPP dyes were purified by size exclusion chromatography and the identity of the materials was confirmed using standard analytical techniques including NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis (see ESI†). From thermal gravimetric analysis, the decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) were recorded as 408 °C, 378 °C and 343 °C for dyes 5, 6 and 7 respectively. A weak glass transition was detected at 130 °C for all three dyes and can be tentatively assigned to side chain rearrangements in the dye samples (see ESI†). The optoelectronic properties of organic materials are important parameters that determine the applicability of a material in organic electronic devices. In BHJ solar cells, the UV-vis absorption profile of the material determines the maximum amount of light a device can potentially capture. The relative energy levels of the electron donor and acceptor materials also have to be compatible for device operation. The energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor defines the potential output (open circuit voltage) of the device.1 In this study, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the materials were measured from a combination of UV-vis spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques.
The UV-vis spectra of FHBC–DPP dyes 5, 6 and 7 in dichloromethane solution are shown in Fig. 1a. All three dyes have an absorption band at 365 nm which can be assigned to the FHBC component of the material. Charge transfer absorption bands for the DPP portion of the molecules were recorded at 580 nm for dye 5 and 628 nm for dyes 6 and 7 (Fig. 1a). Broadening of the absorption bands was observed in the thin film UV-vis spectrum of dye 5 with a red-shift (∼20 nm) of the charge transfer band (Fig. 1b). Similar observations were made for the thin film absorption spectra of dyes 6 and 7 (see ESI†). The red shift in absorption of these materials is an indication that there is significant aggregation of the materials in solid state. The aggregation behavior of the dyes will be examined in greater detail in the following section using NMR spectroscopy in solution and two-dimensional wide angle X-ray scattering (2D-WAXS) in solid state. As the objective of this study was to use the FHBC unit as a scaffold to induce ordered assembly of aggregates, the results from the X-ray experiments will have important consequences for the charge transport characteristics of the material and ultimately for solar cell device performance.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the dyes showed emission maximum at 627 nm for FHBC–DPP dye 5 and 657 nm for dyes 6 and 7 (Fig. 1c). Excitation at the HBC band (365 nm) and at the charge transfer band (580 nm) gave the same emission band for the dyes indicating efficient energy transfer from the HBC moiety to the DPP unit. Weak broadened emissions were also recorded for thin films of the FHBC–DPP dyes and there was a red shift in the emission maxima (∼100 nm) for all three compounds compared to the solution spectra (Fig. 1d). Fluorescence from the dyes was completely quenched when blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, PC61BM, in a ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 1d and ESI†). This was a good indication that the FHBC–DPP dyes could serve as an electron donor material with the fullerene derivative as the electron acceptor material in BHJ solar cells.
Frontier orbital energy level information can also provide predictions about the compatibility of the electron donor and electron acceptor materials in BHJ devices. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the dyes were obtained from a combination of electrochemical and UV-vis absorption experiments (Fig. 2). Electrochemical studies for FHBC–DPP dyes were performed in dichloromethane solution and a summary of the electrochemical data can be found in Table 1 (see ESI† for cyclic voltammograms). The HOMO energy levels were calculated from the onset of the oxidation of the dyes while the LUMO energy levels were derived from the HOMO values and the optical energy gap (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The energy level information suggests that all three dyes are suitable candidates as electron donor materials in a bulk heterojunction solar cell with PC61BM as the electron acceptor.

Self-association properties and solid state organisation
Similar to other 2,11-bis-substituted FHBC derivatives reported previously,18,20–23 extensive molecular aggregation was observed in solution as well as in solid state for FHBC–DPP dyes 5, 6 and 7. In solution, broad signals were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of all three FHBC–DPP dyes. In addition, shifts in the proton resonances were observed with variations in concentrations. The change in the chemical shifts could be clearly observed in the case of FHBC–DPP dye 5 (Fig. 3). With an increase in concentration, the HBC core proton signals (H1 to H4) shifted upfield while the protons resonances on the DPP unit did not change significantly. The upfield shift with increasing concentration is indicative of π–π stacking of the HBC cores where the protons in the HBC aggregate stacks experienced a shielding effect as a result of the HBC aromatic ring current in close proximity. The fact that the DPP proton resonances did not change with concentration suggests that the FHBC–DPP aggregates are stacked in a staggered manner (Fig. 3). These FHBC–DPP ordered aggregates observed in solution are expected to have a significant impact on the formation of ordered structures in solution processed thin films.

The organisation of FHBC–DPP molecules in the solid state was investigated using X-ray experiments. Two-dimensional wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-WAXS) measurements were performed on thin filaments of dyes 5, 6 and 7. Filaments of 0.7 mm diameter were prepared by filament extrusion and mounted vertically towards the 2D detector.29Fig. 4a shows a 2D pattern for 5 which is characteristic for a discotic columnar liquid crystalline phase.30,31 Hereby, the molecules are packed in columns in an orthogonal (non-tilted) fashion with a π-stacking distance of 0.35 nm as indicated by the wide-angle meridional reflections. The stacks are arranged in a hexagonal lattice with the parameter of 5.35 nm to each other as assigned from the small-angle equatorial scattering intensities, whereby these superstructures are aligned along the extrusion direction (along the fiber axis) (see illustration in Fig. 4d). Interestingly, the location of the reflections changes for 6 and 7 (Fig. 4b and c). The wide-angle reflections are positioned on the equatorial plane of the pattern and are related to a stacking distance of 0.35 nm for both cases. The meridional small-angle reflections correspond to a d-spacing of only 1.91 nm for 6 and 1.88 nm for 7. This decrease in spacing and the change in the location of the reflections strongly suggest a significant modification of the supramolecular organisation and the molecular orientation in comparison to 5. Based on the X-ray results a model is developed which is schematically exhibited in Fig. 4d. Surprisingly, the slight extension of the long molecular axis just by a benzothiophene or benzofuran unit induces a lamellar arrangement of the molecules. Thereby, the lamellae stacks are spaced ca. 1.9 nm from each other and are oriented perpendicular to the extrusion direction. This behavior is rather untypical since one could expect that the molecules align with their molecular axis along the fiber axis due their high aspect ratio. Finally, it should be noted that the broad reflections indicate a decrease of the overall order for 6 and 7 which could in turn be related to the lamellae organisation. The effect of this change in organisation on the device performance is clarified in the next sections. In all cases, the organisation in the liquid crystalline phase does not change within the investigated temperature range (−100 to 250 °C) confirming a pronounced mesophase stability of these systems.

Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering experiments (GI-WAXS) were used to probe the molecular order of FHBC–DPP hybrid materials in thin blended films with PC71BM (see solar cell setup). In all three cases, only isotropic ring reflections appear in the pattern which are assigned to crystallized PC71BM domains (Fig. S28†). Interestingly, the FHBC–DPP derivatives remain disordered/amorphous under these processing conditions.
Charge transport in FHBC–DPP dyes
The charge transport of FHBC–DPP dyes was measured both in OFETs and in vertical hole only devices using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. The bottom gate bottom contact OFETs were fabricated on a silicon substrate with HMDS surface-modified SiO2 dielectric and lithographically patterned gold source and drain electrodes. The FHBC–DPP dyes were deposited by drop-casting from a 2 mg ml−1 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution. Fig. 5 shows the typical transfer and output transistor plots for 6 for which a hole mobility of 1.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of 103 were determined. The other compounds 5 and 7 revealed similar hole mobility values in the 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 range under the same processing parameters (Table 2 and see ESI† for detailed data). Vertical charge transport of FHBC–DPP films was measured by the SCLC method (Table 2 and see ESI† for experimental details). The SCLC values are in the same range as the OFET mobility values. This is indicative of isotropic molecular organisation in the dye thin films. It is interesting to note that while dye 5 showed ordered columnar structures in solid state extruded fiber samples (Fig. 4), its mobility values in thin films are in the same range as that of dyes 6 and 7 which are more disordered.

The surface morphology of thin films was examined using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). The samples were prepared by spin coating the material of interest on the silicon substrate (25 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene, 2000 rpm). The tapping mode AFM images of thin films of blends of dyes 5, 6 and 7 with PC71BM (1:4) can be found in the ESI (Fig. S32†). A nano-scale phase separation was observed in all four blend films. The blends all gave a similar phase separation with domain sizes less than 20 nm.
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells
Given all the photophysical, self-organisation and charge transport studies presented above, the FHBC derivatives appear to be ideal candidates for the electron donor material in BHJ solar cells. BHJ solar cells with device structure ITO|PEDOT:PSS|FHBC–DPP:PC71BM (1:2 w/w)|TiOx/Al [ITO, indium tin oxide; PEDOT, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene); PSS, poly(styrenesulfonate)] using the FHBC–DPP dyes 5, 6 and 7 as electron donors, and PC71BM as electron acceptor were fabricated and characterized. The ratio of donor and acceptor materials was device-optimized at 1:4 and the thickness of the photoactive layers was optimized for each of the donor–acceptor blends and was typically around 100 nm. In general, all devices showed good diode-like behavior in the dark and photovoltaic effects under simulated AM 1.5G illumination. Table 3 summarizes the device performance of the various solar cells and the following characteristic parameters are given: short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power-conversion efficiency (PCE). The current density to voltage and external quantum efficiency curves for the BHJ devices are shown in Fig. 6.

High Voc values close to 0.9 V were observed for all three FHBC–DPP dye/PC71BM BHJs. The Voc of a BHJ solar cell device depends primarily on the energy gap between donor HOMO and acceptor LUMO of the materials. Energy gaps of 1.6 to 1.7 eV, derived from Fig. 2, are in agreement with the Voc values measured for the devices. The Jsc values of the devices are moderate with devices containing donor 5 giving about 4 mA cm−2. Despite the fact that films containing dyes 6 and 7 absorbed more light compared with dye 5 (Fig. 1), the current density of devices with dyes 6 and 7 was lower than that of dye 5 (Table 3). From the photo-response device data, it is clear that dye 5 devices have much higher conversion efficiency in the 500–600 nm region (Fig. 6b). Morphology differences and charge transport efficiency are possible reasons for this observation. The thin films of dye 5 showed better vertical charge transport properties (SCLC mobility) than the films of 6 and 7 (Table 2). This correlates with the trend in Jsc data (Table 3). Given the moderate current density and fill factor, the power conversion efficiency ranged from 1.1 to 1.6%.
Conclusions
Liquid crystalline organic dyes consisting of fluorenyl hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (FHBC) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units were synthesised and thoroughly characterised. All FHBC–DPP derivatives revealed a liquid crystalline supramolecular organisation due to π–π stacking interactions between the FHBC units. The extended absorption in the visible region was a result of the DPP appendages. Interestingly, small changes in the molecular structure resulted in large changes in bulk organisation. Although the extension of the molecule in dyes 6 and 7 gave a broadened absorption compared to dye 5, the change in the aspect ratio of the molecule caused a switch in the bulk order. Extruded fibers of dye 5 showed a columnar arrangement while molecules of dyes 6 and 7 showed lamellar packing. Interestingly, the charge mobility values for thin films of the dyes are all in the same range when measured by OFET and SCLC methods. In BHJ solar cells made in air, devices containing dye 5 showed the best performance with a high open circuit voltage of 0.86 V and a power conversion efficiency of 1.59%. The differences in BHJ device performance are most likely related to the morphology of the blend films. From this study, it is clear that small molecular changes can lead to substantial differences in molecular properties, bulk properties and device performance.
