    , Accepted 9th September 2012First published on 11th September 2012AbstractThree new copolymers (PT-TPA, PT-DTBT and PT-DTBTTPA) based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene (BDT) and thiophene with different conjugated side chains (di(p-tolyl)phenylamine (TPA), 4,7-dithien-5-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) and DTBT-TPA) were synthesized via Stille coupling polymerization. The TPA and the DTBT were introduced to improve the hole-transport ability and broaden the absorption spectrum. The effects of different conjugated side groups on thermal, optical, electrochemical, hole-transporting and photovoltaic properties of these copolymers were investigated. Field effect results show that the copolymer PT-DTBTTPA containing TPA and DTBT in the side chain showed the highest hole mobility. The three copolymers exhibit deep-lying HOMO energy levels, which were effectively tuned by changing the side groups. Photovoltaic cells were fabricated with the synthesized copolymers as electron donors and [6,6]-phenyl-C-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron acceptor. Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells based on PT-DTBT and PT-DTBTTPA showed promising power conversion efficiencies of 5.50% and 5.16%, respectively.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on conjugated copolymers as donors and fullerene derivative as an acceptor1 have been intensively studied in recent years for their low-cost, lightweight, mechanical flexibility, fast/cheap roll-to-roll production and easy tunability of chemical properties of the photovoltaic materials.2–5 In the past two years, a lot of new donor–accept (D–A) low band gap polymers have been reported for high-performance PSCs. For example, the solar cells based on the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene (BDT) copolymer have achieved a series of high power conversion efficiency (PCE) values in the range 3–8%.6–9 It is well recognized that to achieve a high efficiency, polymers require a broad absorption spectrum that matches the solar spectrum as well as possible, deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and excellent charge transport ability.
For traditional conjugated polymers, it is hard to meet all the above demands. For instance, to broaden the absorption spectrum, we need to increase the length of the conjugated unit of the main chain, which would reduce the hole mobility of the polymer. To pursue the high hole mobility as well as possible, researchers have developed a new family of polymers with conjugated side groups or side chains10–12 that broaden the absorption spectrum as well as keep the high hole mobility. In our earlier research, we found that the absorption spectrum of a BDT copolymer PT-DTBTID containing 1,3-indanedione (ID) and the DTBT side groups has better match with the solar spectrum, but it dramatically decreased the hole mobility and PCE due to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the ID side group.12
Here, we synthesized a new series of conjugated copolymers (PT-TPA, PT-DTBT and PT-DTBTTPA, Fig. 1) by introducing the di(p-tolyl)phenylamine (TPA) group with an excellent hole mobility13 to improve the hole-transport properties of the resulted copolymer. The effects of the conjugated side groups on the thermal, photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the copolymers were investigated in detail, and we acquired the side chain conjugated copolymers with the highest power conversion efficiency reported nowadays.

General instrumentation

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with Bruker AVANCE 400 spectrometer. UV-vis spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the copolymers were obtained on Perkin-Elmer Lamada 25 spectrometer and Perkin-Elmer LS-50 luminescence spectrometer, respectively. FT-IR spectra were measured on Perkin-Elmer Spectra One. Molecular mass was determined by matrix assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) using a Bruker Aupoflex-III mass spectrometer. The average molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the copolymers were determined using Waters 1515 gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard. Thermal analyses were performed on a Netzsch TG 209 analyzer and TA DSCQ10 instrument under N2 atmosphere with a heating and cooling rate of 20 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted on an electrochemistry workstation (CHI660A, Chenhua Shanghai) with the polymer film on a Pt plate as the working electrode, Pt slice as the counter electrode, and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode in a 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.
Fabrication of polymer field-effect transistor devices (FETs)
Polymer-based FETs were fabricated on highly doped silicon wafers with a 300 nm SiO2 insulator, which was used as gate electrode. The source–drain gold electrodes (30 nm) were prepared by photolithography with the channel length (L) and width (W) of 3 μm and 1400 μm, respectively. The substrates were then subjected to cleaning using ultrasonication in acetone, deionized water, and ethanol. Next, octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) treatment was performed on the surface of SiO2 gate dielectrics in a vacuum to form an OTS self-assembled monolayer. To reduce the contact resistance, the gold drain–source electrodes were modified with pentafluorothiophenol according to the reported methods.14 Then, a layer of polymer semiconductor film (∼40 nm) was deposited on the OTS-modified substrates by spin-coating from a polymer solution in chloroform (10 mg mL−1) at a speed of 2000 rpm for 40 s. For further annealing of the polymer films, the samples were placed on a hotplate at 160 °C in air for 5 minutes before cooling down to room temperature. Field-effect characteristics of the devices were determined in air by using a Keithley 4200 SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer. The field-effect mobility in saturation (μ) is calculated from the equation:IDS = (W/2L)Ciμ(VGS − Vth)2where W/L is the channel width/length, Ci is the insulator capacitance per unit area, and VGS and Vth are the gate voltage and threshold voltage, respectively.
Fabrication of photovoltaic devices
The photovoltaic cells were constructed in a traditional sandwich structure. The ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned by successive ultrasonic treatment in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, then treated in a nitrogen–oxygen plasma oven for 5 min. Poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, from Bayer AG) was spin-coated from an aqueous solution on a cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate giving a thickness of about 40 nm as measured by an Ambios Technology XP-2 surface profilometer. It was then dried at 150 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, the photoactive layer was prepared by spin-coating a dichlorobenzene solution of copolymer:PCBM (1:4, w/w), with a polymer concentration of 6 mg mL−1, on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer giving an active layer thickness of ca. 100 nm, and then annealed at 150 °C for 5 min in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Finally, the substrates were transferred into an evaporator and pumped down to 5 × 10−4 Pa to deposit 5 nm of LiF and 100 nm of aluminum cathode, producing an active area of 4 mm2 for each cell. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured by a Keithley 2602 Source Meter under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation using a 500 W Xe lamp equipped with a global AM 1.5 filter for solar spectrum simulation, and the incident light intensity was calibrated using a standard Si solar cell. The measurement of monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was performed using a Zolix DCS300PA data acquisition system.

The aldehyde-functionalized compound 3 was prepared by Vilsmeier–Haack formylation of compound 2 under mild conditions.18 Bromination of compound 3 with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) yielded compound 4. A Suzuki coupling reaction was performed between compound 4 and compound 1 to afford compound 5. The key intermediates, dibromide monomers (M1, M2 and M3), were synthesized from compound 6 and aldehyde compounds (4-di(p-tolylamino)benzaldehyde, compound 3 and 5) in moderate yields according to the Witting–Horner reaction. The structures of monomers M1, M2 and M3 were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT-IR, and MALDI-TOF MS. The polymerization reaction was proceeded by the Stille coupling polymerization method between M4 and the monomers M1, M2 and M3. All the copolymers exhibited excellent solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane and chlorobenzene. Table 1 summarizes the polymerization results and thermal properties of the copolymers. The molecular weights (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) of these copolymers, determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrenes as standards with tetrahydrofuran as the eluent, were Mw = 9.5 kg mol−1 with PDI = 1.57 for PT-TPA, Mw = 52.5 kg mol−1 with PDI = 2.6 for PT-DTBT, and Mw = 15.0 kg mol−1 with PDI = 1.78 for PT-DTBTTPA.

The three copolymers (PT-TPA, PT-DTBT and PT-DTBTTPA) have good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures (Td) corresponding to 5% weight loss at 322, 368 and 359 °C, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. The glass transition temperature of PT-DTBT is 155 °C,12 whereas neither phase transition temperatures nor melting peaks of PT-TPA or PT-DTBTTPA were observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Obviously, the thermal stability of these copolymers is adequate for their applications in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices.

Photophysical properties
The photophysical properties of the copolymers are investigated by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy in diluted CHCl3 solution and thin films on quartz plates. Fig. 3 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra and Table 2 summarizes the optical data, including the absorption peak wavelengths (λs,max, λf,max), absorption edge wavelengths (λedg) and the optical band gaps. All of the absorption spectra recorded from dilute chloroform solutions feature three absorption bands. The first one around 307 nm results from the n–π* transition of TPA group19 or/and the absorption of the 4,7-dithien-5-yl-2,1,3-benzodiathiazole (DTBT) group. The second absorption band with the absorption maxima (λs,max) at 398 nm for PT-TPA, 389 nm for PT-DTBT, 365 nm for PT-DTBTTPA originates from a delocalized excitonic π–π* transition. The third broad band with λs,max at 478, 504 and 497 nm, respectively, corresponds to a localized transition between donor–acceptor charge transfer states, and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the main chains and the conjugated side chains.20 Obviously, the localized transition and ICT interactions of the PT-TPA progressively decrease due to the disappearance of the DTBT unit and the increase of the electron repellent of the TPA group, the latter reason could also explain the blue-shifted absorption of PT-DTBTTPA compared with that of PT-DTBT. The absorption spectra of copolymer films are broadened and the peaks are red-shifted compared to their solution absorption spectra, which was mainly attributed to the enhanced intermolecular interactions between neighboring molecules in the film state. The absorption edges of PT-TPA, PT-DTBT and PT-DTBTTPA films are 613, 644 and 673 nm, corresponding to optical band gaps of 2.02, 1.92 and 1.84 eV, respectively.

Fig. 4 shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the copolymers in a dilute chloroform solution. The three copolymers are excited at wavelengths corresponding to the second and third λs,max. For instance, PT-DTBTTPA exhibits the same PL spectrum when it is excited at 365 and 497 nm, respectively, which indicates that quick and complete intramolecular energy transfer of the excitons occurs from the conjugated side chains to the main chains. The phenomenon ensures that the photons absorbed by the polymers are useful for photovoltaic conversion.21 In CHCl3 solution, PT-TPA exhibited a maximum emission peak at 554 nm. With the conjugated DTBT group, PT-DTBT and PT-DTBTTPA showed similarly red-shifted maximum emission peaks at 682 and 693 nm, respectively, compared with that of PT-TPA. All the results illustrate that the optical properties of the three copolymers can be effectively tuned by changing conjugated side groups.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical behavior of the copolymers was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The cyclic voltammograms of PT-TPA, PT-DTBT and PT-DTBTTPA films are shown in Fig. 5, and Table 2 gives the CV data. The potentials were referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+). The redox potential of Fc/Fc+ was assumed to have an absolute energy level of −4.8 eV under vacuum.22 The redox potential of Fc/Fc+ was measured under the same conditions as the polymer samples and was located at 0.51 V related to the Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE). The onset potentials for oxidation (Eox) are observed to be 1.06, 1.15 and 1.09 V for PT-TPA, PT-DTBT and PT-DTBTTPA, respectively. The HOMO energy levels of the copolymers were calculated according to the equation: HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.29) eV. The HOMO energy levels of PT-TPA, PT-DTBT, and PT-DTBTTPA were at −5.35 eV, −5.44 eV, and −5.38 eV respectively. It has been demonstrated that the open-circuit voltage (Voc) value in BHJ solar cells is linearly dependent on the difference between the HOMO level of p-type polymer and the LUMO level of an n-type PC61BM.23 The HOMO energy level of PT-DTBTTPA attributed to the introduction of triphenylamine moiety was reduced compared with PT-DTBT, indicating that hole-injection and transporting properties have been improved.24 The copolymer PT-DTBT has the lowest HOMO energy level, predicting that it would achieve the highest Voc value. In addition, the deep HOMO levels of the three copolymers are under −5.20 eV, which is the threshold HOMO energy level for air stable conjugated polymers,25,26 and should be beneficial to their chemical stability in ambient conditions. The LUMO energy levels of PT-TPA, PT-DTBT and PT-DTBTTPA were −3.33, −3.44 and −3.54 eV calculated from the optical band gaps and HOMO energy levels of the copolymers. When comparing the LUMO levels of the polymers and the acceptor (−4.2 eV for PC60BM),27,28 it is seen that the energy differences of LUMO levels are sufficient to result in an efficient charge transfer, that is, higher than the suggested 0.3 eV.29 Moreover, we found that the LUMO energy levels of the three copolymers PT-TPA, PT-DTBT and TP-DTBTTPA are lowered gradually with the increasing length of the conjugated side chains, which can be attributed to the extension of π-electron delocalization in the copolymer backbone.

Hole mobility
To further understand the effect of the incorporation of the TPA side group and the cause of variation in solar cell performance, the hole mobility of these copolymers was measured using the OTFT technique under the same conditions. PT-DTBTTPA with DTBT-TPA side chains demonstrated a higher hole mobility of 4.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 than those of PT-DTBT (3.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and PT-TPA (5.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Table 3). It is clear that the hole mobility of PT-DTBTTPA is higher than that of PT-DTBT, which demonstrates that the TPA group actually improved the hole-transporting ability of the copolymer. While the hole mobility of PT-TPA is the lowest in the three copolymers, it is still increased visibly compared to that of PT-ID.12 In short, the hole mobility of the three copolymers is relatively high, which is the reason for the high power conversion efficiency.

Photovoltaic properties
In order to check whether the conjugated side groups of the three copolymers make a contribution to the photoelectric conversion in the PSCs, the bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM(1:4, w/w)/LiF/Al. The active layers were spin-coated from dichlorobenzene, and in some cases a small amount of the high boiling-point additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used to optimize the morphology. Fig. 6 shows the best J–V curves of the devices under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic parameters, including the short-circuit current density (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE), are summarized in Table 3.
 Fig. 6  
J–V curves of the photovoltaic cells based on PT-TPA, PT-DTBT and PT-DTBTTPA under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2. 
Without the addition of DIO, the power conversion efficiencies for the three copolymers that used PC61BM as the acceptor are in the order of PT-DTBT > PT-DTBTTPA > PT-TPA, and the corresponding data are 4.18%, 3.49%, 1.56%. The sequence of the PCE values for the three copolymers is according to their absorption spectra, Voc values (according to the HOMO energy levels) and the extent of phase separation. Notably, compared with PT-TPA, the copolymers PT-DTBT and PT-DTBTTPA, which contain the DTBT side group, have higher PCE values than that of PT-TPA. This is probably due to the strong and broad absorption spectra (Fig. 2). And then compared with PT-DTBT, the copolymer PT-DTBTTPA exhibits a slightly lower PCE value although the addition of the TPA group on the side chain enhances the hole mobility. That is because the Jsc value of PT-DTBT is higher than that of PT-DTBTTPA due to the different phase separation state. From the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of three copolymers (Fig. 7) and the amplified AFM phase images (Fig. S13†) of PT-DTBTTPA-PC61BM with and without DIO, we can see that there is no large phase separation for PT-DTBT, but the phase separation for PT-TPA and PT-DTBTTPA are relatively obvious. However, it is clear that the phase separation for PT-DTBTTPA has been improved obviously by adding 1% DIO. As we know, the use of high-boiling-point additives such as DIO could promote the packing of the polymer by avoiding excessive crystallization of the fullerene,30 which is beneficial to improve the PCE of the copolymers. Therefore, the devices of PT-DTBT with different DIO ratios were studied, and a ratio of 1% showed the best device performance of 5.35%. Then we measured a PT-DTBTTPA-based device using this ratio of DIO. As a result, the PCE of PT-DTBTTPA improved slightly from 3.48% to 3.81%, compared to that of PT-DTBT, which was improved from 4.18% to 5.35%.
 Fig. 7  AFM phase images (500 × 500 nm) for copolymer:PC61BM blend films: (a) PT-TPA, (b) PT-DTBT and (c) PT-DTBTTPA. 
In addition, the photovoltaic properties of PT-DTBT and PT-DTBTTPA were investigated in BHJ solar cells using PC71BM as the acceptor. We obtain the maximum power conversion efficiency of 5.50% based on PT-DTBT (Jsc = 14.64 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.79 V, FF = 0.48). It is noteworthy that the PCE of PT-DTBTTPA cannot exceed the PCE of PT-DTBT, but the PCE of PT-DTBTTPA improved significantly from 3.81% to 5.16%. It can account for the obvious increase in Jsc as revealed by incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 8), which may result from the better charge transfer and the decrease of electron aggregation by improving the miscibility between PT-DTBTTPA and PC71BM. According to the data, it is clear that the efficiencies of the PSCs can be strongly affected by TPA and DTBT side groups in the backbone of copolymer molecules.

Conclusion
In summary, three novel benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene and thiophene copolymers with TPA, DTBT and DTBT-TPA side groups are successfully synthesized and characterized. All of the copolymers are found to exhibit good thermal stability. The research results show that the conjugated side groups can broaden the absorption spectrum as well as improve the hole-transporting properties of copolymers, and as a result, improve the power conversion efficiencies. These copolymers appear promising for application in BHJ solar cells due to their good solubilities and their low band gaps as well as their high hole mobilities. The broad absorption spectra, deep HOMO levels and the noticeably high hole mobilities of PT-DTBT and PT-DTBTTPA contribute to the outstanding Jsc, Voc as well as the high device efficiencies over 5.0%. The best PCE of the device based on PT-DTBT reached 5.50%, which shows that PT-DTBT is promising for the potential application of photovoltaic cells.
