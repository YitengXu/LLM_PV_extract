    , Accepted 10th March 2023First published on 13th March 2023AbstractThe structural and optical properties of Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+-codoped aurivillius-structured Bi2WO6 phosphors are reported. Simultaneous substitution of Bi3+ and W6+ by Er3+/Yb3+ and Mo6+ ions in a codoped phosphor was explored for photoluminescence study. The green emission was enhanced with the codoping of Yb3+ as well as Mo6+ ions in Er3+:Bi2WO6 phosphors. In the Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+-codoped Bi2WO6 phosphors, the Yb3+–MoO42− dimer state transfers its energy to Er3+ ions and is found responsible for the enhancement. The luminescence saturation processes with increased photon density have been discussed using rate equations. The 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 energy levels of Er3+ ions are adapted for optical thermometry. The absolute and relative sensitivities were found with a resolution of 0.38 K at room temperature and repeatability cycles of FIR. The thermal stability has been verified with the Arrhenius equation.
1. Introduction
A special type of perovskite, namely the aurivillius-structured material, is identified by the extensive term (Bi2O2)(An−1BnO3n+1) (where A is a 12 coordinated bigger cation than 6 co-ordinate smaller cation B). With n = 1 and B = W, Bi2WO6 constitutes the most basic member of this crystallographic group.1 The n-type semiconductor bismuth tungstate has a direct bandgap of 2.75 eV. The interesting intrinsic physical and chemical characteristics of Bi2WO6 include ferroelectric piezoelectricity, nonlinear dielectric susceptibility, and photocatalytic activity.2 In addition, it may be utilized in electrode materials for the conversion of solar energy,3 CO2 reduction,4 and water splitting by photoelectrochemical processes.5 The selection of Bi2WO6 as an upconverting material doped with the activator Er3+ with sensitizer Yb3+ ions may result in fascinating outputs. The symmetry of Er3+/Yb3+ ions breaks while entering into the host lattice because of which the forbidden f–f transition becomes allowed.6,7 The combination of Er3+/Yb3+ ions is frequently used because Er3+ ions have the most abundant energy levels among rare earths and absorption cross-section increases using Yb3+ ions corresponding to 980 nm laser irradiation.7,8 Also, excitation power density plays an essential role in achieving the maximum output from the luminescent materials. The efficiency of promising UC phosphors depends on various factors for example kind of host matrix, doped rare earth/non-lanthanide ions, dopant's concentration, excitation power, the thermal stability of materials, etc. The codoping of non-lanthanides usually acts as a charge compensator and sensitizer, which increases the intensity and thermal stability of the phosphors.9,10 It has been proposed that the codoping of transition metals successfully improves the up-conversion performance.11,12 Thus, the transition metal molybdate may play a vital role to enhance the emission arising from rare earth ions. The substitution of tungstate with molybdate can be a good choice since they have an equivalent ionic charge and comparable ionic radius. Moreover, Mo6+ ion has its own energy levels, which may contribute to luminescence.13
Furthermore, in our daily lives, medical treatment, scientific analysis, and other sectors, precise and quick thermometry is extremely important.14,15 However, the thermally coupled levels (TCLs) of the activator ions in the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) approach of the temperature detection should lie in the 200 cm−1 to 2000 cm−1 range.16 The FIR technology does not rapidly influence by fluorescence loss, fluctuating excitation power, or the amount of luminescence centers.6,17 In order to design sensors with the best possible sensing capabilities, it is important to take into consideration the FIR and the energy difference ΔE between two energy levels. The more disorderliness in the local surroundings around rare earth ions causes a larger change in FIR. It may result in an improvement in temperature sensitivity, which is an essential characteristic of the temperature-detecting device. The sensitivity of this device is stated as the small fluctuation in FIR with respect to temperature. As a result, the temperature sensing properties are specified by employing the maximum sensitivity and temperature detection range. The resolution and repeatability of FIR are the key parameters to achieve precision in measuring the sensitivity of the phosphors.18
In the current study, Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+-codoped Bi2WO6 phosphors were produced for their structural and optical investigations. The proposed energy transfer mechanism and the pump power-dependent saturation effect are explained with rate equations. The sensor properties such as thermal resolution and accuracy were determined. The Arrhenius equation was used to assess the thermal stability of the codoped Bi2WO6 phosphors.
2. Material synthesis and characterization
The solid-state reaction approach was utilized for phosphors synthesis. The basic components in the production of the phosphors were Bi2O3, WO3, Er2O3, Yb2O3, and MoO3. All mixtures were taken into the stoichiometric ratio and ground into mortar-pestle using acetone for 90 minutes. For high-temperature synthesis, the mixed reagents were kept at 1000 °C for three hours. After naturally cooling to ambient temperature, the powder phosphors were extracted for impending investigations.
Several characterizing tools were employed to reveal the properties of the developed phosphors. The X-ray diffractometer was used to confirm the formation of the phosphor. The morphological investigation was conducted using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). A PerkinElmer spectrometer was used for recording FTIR spectra. Raman spectra were recorded using a HORIBA Scientific's Raman spectrometer. The oxidation states of the atoms present in the phosphors corresponding to binding energies were studied using X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS). The UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer was used to monitor the diffuse reflectance spectra. The frequency UC study was performed using the 980 nm continuous wave laser irradiation. The spectra were recorded using the monochromator, which consists of a triple grating and a photomultiplier tube. With a homemade heater controlled by variable voltage linked to a thermocouple and multimeter from, using which, the temperature-based measurements were accomplished. Calculations of CIE coordinates were performed using the GoCIE programme.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural characterization
The crystalline behavior of the produced phosphors resembled by the diffraction pattern shown in the JCPDS file 79-2381 (Fig. 1(a)). It confirmed that Bi2WO6 had an orthorhombic structure with space group Pca21. The unit cell consisted of a = 5.43 Å, b = 16.43 Å, c = 5.45 Å, α = β = γ = 90.00° and volume = 487.56 Å3. In the structure of Bi2WO6, [WO4]2− molecular ionic units have strong W–O covalent connections, and the [WO4]2− anions with Bi3+ cations have weak coupling. The atomic layers of Bi are squeezed in the octahedral WO6 layers and the Bi2WO6 structure was created by alternating the layers of (Bi2O2)2+ and (WO4)2− (Fig. 1(b)).19,20

The prepared Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors were found with no impurity phase. The most intense peak corresponded to the (131) hkl plane. The peak intensity of the orthorhombic system increased with doping rare earths and further by molybdate, which showed an increment in the crystallinity. Further, the Debye Scherrer equation was used to determine the crystallite size (D) as,21,22 (1)where ‘λ’ implies X-ray wavelength, ‘β’ is for the full width at half maxima, and ‘θ’ is for Bragg's diffraction angle. The estimated dimensions of the crystallites are 42.84 nm, 37.47 nm, and 47.91 nm, pertaining to Bi2WO6, Er3+/Yb3+:Bi2WO6, and Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors, respectively. The crystallite size first decreases with rare earth doping and then increases with incorporating Mo6+ ions. The ionic radii of the elements in phosphors are 1.03 Å (Bi3+), 0.60 Å (W6+), 0.89 Å (Er3+), 0.86 Å (Yb3+), and 0.59 Å (Mo6+).23 With a larger ionic radius of Bi3+ than that of rare earths and with the same ionic charge, there is a higher probability of Er3+/Yb3+ ions substituting the Bi3+ sites. This was confirmed with the slight XRD peak shift towards the higher 2θ value. The permissible percent of dopants substitution is related to the radius of the doped ion Rd(CN) and the radius of the host cation Rm(CN) by the following equation,24 (2)
The Dr values of 13% and 16% (i.e., <30%), for Er3+/Yb3+ and Bi3+ ions in six coordinated sites, demonstrate that the dopants effectively replaced the Bi3+ sites in the Bi2WO6 phosphors. Also, the ionic radii of Mo6+ and W6+ are comparable with the same ionic charge. The Dr for Mo6+ and W6+ ions is 1.0%, which shows that the Mo6+ most probably occupies the W sites. The doping concentration of Mo6+ was varied up to 50 mol%. Some small peaks were observed, which can be neglected. Therefore, the dopants with the same charge and similar ionic radius to the substitutional ions do not disturb the crystal system.
The FESEM image of the optimized Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+:Bi2WO6 displays the particles with irregular shapes of different sizes (Fig. 1(c)). The presence of erbium, ytterbium, molybdenum, bismuth and oxygen was confirmed from the EDX spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†).

Fig. 1(d) displays the FTIR spectrum of the undoped Bi2WO6 in the 400–4000 cm−1 range. The spectrum consists of several peaks at ∼550 cm−1, ∼733 cm−1, and ∼820 cm−1 due to the stretching Bi–O, W–O, and asymmetric stretching W–O–W vibrations, respectively (Fig. 1(d) inset). The maximum intensity peak in the FTIR spectrum was at 733 cm−1 (phonon energy), resulting from the stretching vibration of the W–O bond. The ∼1636 cm−1 and ∼3448 cm−1 peaks are stretching and bending modes of the OH group.25,26
The Raman spectrum of the Bi2WO6 host was recorded from 100–1000 cm−1 (Fig. 1(e)). The phonon energy plays a crucial role in deciding the lattice instabilities for photoluminescence applications. From the C2v symmetry, the Raman modes of the orthorhombic Bi2WO6 having the Pca21 structure is given by 26A1 + 27A2 + 26B1 + 26B2. Among these, the A2 modes are only Raman active and A1, B1, and B2 modes are both Raman and IR active. Several peaks were observed at ∼142 cm−1, ∼151 cm−1, ∼221 cm−1, ∼262 cm−1, ∼285 cm−1, ∼309 cm−1, ∼331 cm−1, ∼420 cm−1, ∼459 cm−1, ∼574 cm−1, ∼724 cm−1, ∼792 cm−1 and ∼829 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of Bi2WO6.27 The strongest peaks ∼792 cm−1 and ∼829 cm−1 correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric vibration of O–W–O bonds in the WO4 octahedra. The peak at ∼331 cm−1 is due to the vibration of the Bi–O bond. The ∼309 cm−1 peak shows the translational motion of Bi3+ and WO66− throughout the crystal lattice. The peak at ∼285 cm−1 represents the bending mode of Bi–O polyhedral.20,28,29 The other peaks at ∼704 cm−1, ∼574 cm−1, ∼459 cm−1, and ∼420 cm−1 are IR active vibrations.27
The chemical states corresponding to the binding energies were obtained with XPS. The survey scan of Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+: Bi2WO6 phosphors over 0–1200 eV is shown in Fig. 1(f). The calibration peak of C1s occurs at ∼285 eV. According to the derived XPS spectrum, the phosphors contain O, W, Bi, Er, Yb, and Mo elements. The XPS peaks at ∼26.0 eV (O 2s), ∼530.1 eV (O 1s), and ∼974.9 eV (OKLL) are due to the presence of oxygen (ESI,† Fig. S2(a)). The peaks detected at ∼35.2 eV (W 4f7/2), and ∼37.4 eV (W 4f5/2) show the spin–orbit splitting modes of W6+ (Fig. S2(b), ESI†).30,31 The other peaks in the survey scan are present at ∼247.5 eV (W 4d5/2), ∼260.5 eV (W 4d3/2), ∼427.0 eV (W 4p3/2), and ∼497 eV (W 4p1/2). The peaks originating at ∼159.0 eV (Bi 4f7/2) and ∼164.4 eV (Bi 4f5/2) are due to the spin–orbital splitting of the Bi3+ state (Fig. S2(c), ESI†).19,31 The other peaks in the survey scan are at ∼442.5 eV (Bi 4d5/2) ∼466.4 eV (Bi 4d3/2) and ∼681.1 eV (Bi 4p3/2).32 The intensity of the XPS peaks is directly proportional to the atoms present; therefore, the peaks for the dopants are very less intense due to low concentrations. The rare earth ions have a fixed oxidation state (+3). The peak located at ∼171.0 eV detects the 4d3/2 energy state of Er3+ ions (Fig. S2(d), ESI†).33 The ∼7.0 eV and ∼184.4 eV peaks are due to 4f5/2 and 4d5/2 states, respectively, indicating the existence of Yb3+ ions (Fig. S2(e), ESI†).33 The peaks at ∼232.7 eV (3d3/2) and ∼235.6 eV (3d5/2) correspond to Mo6+ in the Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+ codoped phosphors (Fig. S2(f), ESI†).34
3.2. Optical studies

Fig. 2(a) displays the DRS of the synthesized phosphors. The bare Bi2WO6 phosphors do not contain any absorption peaks. In the Er3+ andYb3+-codoped Bi2WO6 phosphors, the peaks observed at ∼488 nm, ∼522 nm, ∼541 nm, ∼654 nm, ∼798 nm, and ∼974 nm result due to the absorption from the ground state 4I15/2 of Er3+ ions to the various excited 4F7/2, 2H11/2, 4S3/2, 4F9/2, 4I9/2 and 4I11/2 states, respectively. The 4I15/2 → 4I11/2 transition (∼974 nm) of Er3+ ions is superimposed with the 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transition of Yb3+ ions. Further, the absorption intensity increases with codoping Mo6+ ions. The DRS spectra can be used to find the bandgap of developed phosphors making use of the Tauc relation and the Kubelka Monk function F(R∞) by,22 [F(R∞)hν] = C(hν − Eg)n(3) F(R∞) = (1 − R)2/2R = K/S(4)where F(R∞) represents the reflectance of the infinitely thick sample with respect to a reference at each wavelength, ‘C’ is constant, ‘hν’ represents photon energy, ‘Eg’ stands for the bandgap and n = ½ for direct bandgap. Again, ‘R’ indicates the diffuse reflectance of the spectrum, ‘K’ implies the absorption coefficient, and ‘S’ indicates the scattering coefficient. The obtained values of bandgap are ∼2.92 eV (Bi2WO6), ∼2.93 eV (Er3+/Yb3+:Bi2WO6) and ∼2.89 eV (Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+:Bi2WO6). Almost no variation was observed in the optical bandgap due to the significantly lower doping content.

Upon the 980 nm excitation of the developed phosphors, the UC emission spectra were measured spanning in the wavelength range of 450–750 nm (Fig. 2(b)). All the phosphors were optically optimized with varying concentrations of Er3+ (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 mol%), Yb3+ (0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0 and 9.0 mol%), and Mo6+ (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, and 50.0 mol%) ions (Fig. S3, ESI†). The intense UC emission peaks, originating from Er3+ ions were observed at ∼524 nm (2H11/2 → 4I15/2) and ∼549 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) along with a red emission at ∼656 nm and ∼668 nm (4F9/2 → 4I15/2). Beyond the critical concentration (0.5 mol%), there is a decrease in the luminescence intensity. Thus, the absorbed excitation energy by Er3+ ions and the energy transfer to other neighboring Er3+ ions is very much dependent on the critical distance, which is calculated to be ∼7.76 Å.35 Here, the value of Rc > 5 Å, confirms that the quenching mechanism is based on the multipolar interaction given by Dexter and van Uitert's relationship.35 From the ln(I/C) vs lnC plot (Fig. S4, ESI†), the obtained slope value was ‘Q = 2.6’. Thus, the exchange interaction is the reason for the concentration quenching among Er3+ ions in the Bi2WO6 phosphors. After the addition of Yb3+ to Er3+:Bi2WO6 phosphors there is an enhancement of intensity by ∼18 fold in the green band and ∼47 fold in the red band. This enhancement is contributed by the larger response of Yb3+ ions for 980 nm excitation. On further codoping of Mo6+ to the Er3+/Yb3+ containing phosphors there is a slight enhancement of UC intensity by ∼1.5 and ∼1.3 fold in the green and red band, respectively, which is ∼27 and ∼60 fold as compared to Er3+-doped phosphors.
The colour emission from the phosphors were visualized with CIE coordinates (Fig. 2(c)). The color coordinates of Er3+:Bi2WO6, Er3+/Yb3+:Bi2WO6, and Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors were (0.29, 0.70), (0.28, 0.70) and (0.28, 0.70), respectively. No changes in the CIE coordinates were detected with dopants. About 96.3% colour purity was achieved in the Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors.
The mechanisms corresponding to the UC emissions upon 980 nm excitation is explained with the schematic of energy levels of Er3+, Yb3+, and Mo6+ ions (Fig. 2(d)). The UC mechanism in the Er3+ and Er3+/Yb3+ system takes place via GSA, ESA, ET, and cross-relaxation processes.17,22 In the singly-doped Bi2WO6 phosphors, via non-radiative relaxation, some of the ions from 4I11/2 are decayed to the 4I13/2 level and are further excited to the 4F9/2 level via the ESA1 process. The radiative transition from the 4F9/2 level produces red emission at 656 nm. Again, a few ions in the 4I11/2 level by sequential absorption are excited to the 4F7/2 level via the ESA2 process. The 4F7/2 level relaxes further to the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels, from which radiative relaxation results in green emission at 524 nm and 549 nm. The codoping of Yb3+ ions intensified the emission according to the following energy transfer processes:ET1: 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 4I15/2 (Er3+) → 2F7/2 (Yb3+) + 4I11/2 (Er3+)ET2: 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 4I11/2 (Er3+) → 2F7/2 (Yb3+) + 4F7/2 (Er3+), 4F7/2 (Er3+) → NRR → 2H11/2, 4S3/2.ET3: 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 4I13/2 (Er3+) → 2F7/2 (Yb3+) + 4F9/2 (Er3+)
On incorporation of Mo6+ in the codoped Bi2WO6 phosphors, the UC emission from Er3+ ions occurs via the sensitization from Yb3+ –MoO42− dimer.36–38 The energy states of Yb3+ (2F7/2 and 2F5/2) and MoO42− (1A1, 3T1, 3T2, 1T1, and 1T2) make the dimer states by electronic coupling.39,40 The ions at the ground state |2F7/2, 1A1〉 absorb 980 nm photons and are excited to the intermediate excited state |2F5/2, 1A1〉 level via GSA. A second photon is absorbed by the ions in the state |2F5/2, 1A1〉 by the ESA process, and then rises to the higher level of |2F7/2, 1T1〉. The ions in the |2F7/2, 1T1〉 level decay non-radiatively to the |2F7/2, 3T2〉, and then energy transfer to the 4F7/2 level of Er3+ takes place. Further, the nonradiative relaxation from 4F7/2 populates the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels. Finally, the population of Er3+ ions in 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels decay to 4I15/2 and a strong green emission occurs. The 4I13/2 level is also populated non-radiatively from the |2F5/2, 1A1〉 state. Furthermore, the population stored in the 4I13/2 level is stimulated to the 4F9/2 level via the ESA1 process. Thus, the intensity of the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 emission transition is further improved.

3.2.1. Pump power-dependent saturation effect and rate equations. 
In the whole UC process, two photons are involved, which can be validated with the pump power study. As, UC intensity (I) is related by pump photon density (p) as I α pn, where, n implies pump photons required to populate the emitting levels. The ‘n’ values for the emission peaks at ∼524 nm, ∼549 nm, and ∼656 nm are ∼1.2, ∼1.47, and ∼1.42 in Er3+/Yb3+ codoped phosphors (Fig. 2(e)). The decrease in the slope value results from the involvement of numerous processes such as energy transfer, non-radiative relaxation, and cross-relaxation.41,42 The pump power density dependent UC emission intensity upon 980 nm excitation of the Er3+, Er3+/Yb3+, and Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphor are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). In the Er3+:Bi2WO6 phosphors, the luminescence intensity increases on tuning the photon density from 0.39 W cm−2 to 19.03 W cm−2 and then starts decreasing. Again, in Er3+/Yb3+:Bi2WO6 and Er3+/Yb3+Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors, the intensity increases from 0.39 W cm−2 to 5.97 W cm−2 and then decreases.
The higher the incident energy and concentration of Yb3+ ions, the more Yb3+ ions are in the excited state within the range of the length of the energy migration. The essential step in the upconversion emission is the energy transfer from the excited state of Yb3+ to the activator Er3+. If there are not enough Er3+ ions, these Er3+ ions will eventually become saturated in absorbing excitation energy from Yb3+ ions. Generally, the lower the power threshold of the saturation effect, the higher the Yb3+ ion concentration.41 In the present case, the number of Yb3+ is double of the Er3+ ions (0.5 mol% Er3+, and 1.0 mol% Yb3+), therefore, even if at low photon density (5.97 W cm−2), the saturation effect was observed.
The lower slope value is attributed to lower enhancement rates at greater pump power, as well as the saturation effect and non-radiative processes involved in the higher excited state.42 This is driven by the local heat effect brought on by laser irradiation and the saturation in the intermediate levels.43,44 Osiac et al., followed by Dey, explained the saturation phenomenon based on the involved thermal equilibrium among two close levels. The increase in pump power increases the phonons’ density, resulting in an increase in nonradiative transitions and quenching of UC luminous intensity.44,45 The linear decay and UC process compete at high pump power, the UC emission's dependence on the pump power is accurate for low power, but it is complicated at high pump power. The slope value determined from the ln[I] vs. ln[p] plot declines with increasing the excitation power in most circumstances due to some intermediate levels becoming saturated at very high pump power and the UC processes becoming pump independent.46,47
The experimental observation of increased luminescence intensity acquired by the population of luminescent ions and decreasing slope value can be theoretically linked to the rate equations.8,48,49 The rate equation approach is based on the population behavior and the individual energy transfer processes by accounting for all the processes leading to population growth and decline in the system under consideration.  
While developing the rate equations, it is assumed that the density of the ground-state population is constant. GSA constantly pumps the system, ETU or ESA performs upconversion steps between succeeding excited states, and the excited states either decay to their subsequent lower-lying states or immediately to the ground state. Thus, the steady-state rate equations for the Er3+–Yb3+ system are: (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)where, NEr,i (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are the population densities of 4I15/2, 4I13/2, 4I11/2, 4F9/2 and 2H11/2/4S3/2 levels of Er3+ ions. NYb,0 and NYb,1 are the population densities of 2F7/2 and 2F5/2 levels of Yb3+ ions. W1, W2 and W4 are the non-radiative decay rates of 4I13/2, 4I11/2 and 2H11/2/4S3/2 states. The radiative decay rates of 4F9/2 and 2H11/2/4S3/2 are  and .  is the radiative decay rate of 2F5/2 of Yb3+ ions. k1, k2 and k3 are the energy transfer rates of ET1, ET2 and ET3, respectively, from the Yb3+ to Er3+ ion. σij is the absorption cross-section between the ith and jth levels of Er3+ ion. σYb is the absorption cross-section between the 2F7/2 and 2F5/2 levels. ρP is the pump power density corresponding to the excitation pump power IP. The absorption cross-section corresponding to the 980 nm excitation of Yb3+ ions is greater than that of Er3+ ions. Therefore, the GSA and ESA processes participate to a lesser extent than ET processes by Yb3+ ions in the population of energy levels and hence GSA/ESA can be neglected.
At the low pump power density, the spontaneous decay from the 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 levels is dominant over the ET2 and ET3. Therefore, the corresponding terms are neglected from eqn (5) and (6). Hence, eqn (9) is reduced to, (10)
And eqn (5) and (6) become, (11) (12)
Using eqn (11) and (12), eqn (7) and (8) becomes, (13) (14)

Eqn (13) and (14) show that the green and red UC emission intensity depends on pump power quadratically, which implied that for populating the 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels, two photons are required. When the pump power increases from low to high, there is competition between the upconversion by ET processes and the linear decay from the 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 levels. Thus, this rate equation model is an ideal case that is valid individually at low and high pump powers.
At high pump power density, ET2 and ET3 must dominant over the non-radiative decay from the 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 levels. Thus, the terms W1NEr,1 and W2NEr,2 are disregarded in the eqn (5) and (6) respectively and rewritten as (15) (16)

Eqn (7) and (8) become, (17) (18)

Eqn (17) displays the green UC emission through one photon absorption process. Again, in eqn (18), the first term is independent of photon density and the second term implies a single-photon absorption. According to the findings described above, at high pump power density, ET2 becomes efficient, and non-radiative processes rise rapidly, resulting in the saturation effect. This interpretation matches well with the experimental data shown in (Fig. 2(c) and (e)).


3.2.2. Temperature-dependent UC study. 
Normally, the luminescence of phosphors depends on temperature variation. Thus, spectra have been monitored over the temperature range of 300–573 K by maintaining a constant laser power density at 5.97 W cm−2. The energy difference between the 2H11/2 (∼524 nm) and 4S3/2 (∼549 nm) levels originating from Er3+ is 869 cm−1. The small energy gap ensures that the FIR approach can be applied to the TCLs to find the temperature sensitivity. The FIR goes on increasing up to 523 K and then decreases. The 2H11/2 level is easily populated by thermalization from the 4S3/2 level as the temperature increases gradually. Thus, the integrated intensities of the TCL pair (IH and IS) can be used according to the Boltzmann distribution theory50 as, (19)where ‘A’ is a constant, ΔE represents the energy difference between TCLs, and k = 0.695 K−1 cm−1 implies Boltzmann's constant. The value of ΔE/k is ∼735.4 and ∼810.2, based on the fitting results using eqn (19) for the Er3+/Yb3+:Bi2WO6 and Er3+/Yb3+Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors, respectively (Fig. 3(a)). This value is approximately coinciding with the value attained from the corresponding UC spectra. Therefore, using the following expression for error ‘δ’, the discrepancy between the fitted energy difference (ΔE) and the experimental energy difference (ΔE0), may be used to assess the accuracy of temperature sensing,51 (20)
 Fig. 3  (a) lnFIR vs T−1 plot of Er3+/Yb3+ and Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors, (b) a plot for absolute and relative sensitivities of Er3+/Yb3+ and Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors, (c) repeatability of FIR of Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors (d) Arrhenius plot of Er3+/Yb3+ and Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors. 
The obtained value of δ is 0.41 and 0.35 for Er3+/Yb3+:Bi2WO6 and Er3+/Yb3+Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors, respectively. The considerable value of δ specifies that at higher temperatures, the energy transfer between TCLs and other levels cannot be ignored. Thus, the temperature detection behavior of the developed phosphors based on the Boltzmann distribution among the H and S levels can be more reliable.
The obtained value of ΔE can be used to find the relative and absolute sensitivity of the phosphors, i.e., the ability to sense every change in UC emission upon a minute change in temperature can be estimated by the expression,52 (21) (22)

Fig. 3(b) shows the variation in the Sr and Sa values with temperature. The maximum sensitivity values of 4.5 × 10−3 K−1@343 K and 5.0 × 10−3 K−1@403 K for Er3+/Yb3+:Bi2WO6 and Er3+/Yb3+Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors, respectively, were obtained. In contrast, the relative sensitivities were found to be a maximum of 8.2 × 10−3 K−1@300 K and 9.0 × 10−3 K−1@302 K for Er3+/Yb3+:Bi2WO6 and Er3+/Yb3+Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors, respectively, and then decreased with temperature. The sensor sensitivity of values in different sensing materials is reported in Table 1. From this table, it is possible to justify the currently developed phosphor's potential application prospects. Further, the maximum sensitivity Smax and the temperature Tmax at which the sensor has maximum sensitivity can be obtained by putting dSa/dT = 0 as,8 (23) (24)

The values of (Sa)max and Tmax are ∼4.5 × 10−3 K−1 and 368 K for the Er3+/Yb3+:Bi2WO6 phosphors and 4.5 × 10−3 K−1 and 405 K for Er3+/Yb3+Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors, which are in close agreement with the result obtained from the experimental calculation followed by eqn (23) and (24). Eqn (23) designates that a greater value of A and a lesser value of ΔE among the TCLs results in higher sensitivity, whereas, eqn (24) shows that to obtain a higher Tmax, the ΔE between the two levels must be large.
Moreover, the thermal resolution (uncertainty; T) in measurements of sensing parameters, i.e., the minimal temperature variation that an optical sensor can detect, is estimated from the equation,53 (25)where δ[ln(FIR)] is the standard deviation of the linear fit to ln (FIR). From eqn (25), it is ensured that higher Sr and lesser δFIR are required for better accuracy. It was found that the thermal resolution at room temperature for the Er3+/Yb3+:Bi2WO6 phosphors is 0.45 K, which has been improved to 0.38 K for the Er3+/Yb3+Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors. The thermal resolution for the Er3+/Yb3+Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors was determined at all temperatures from 302–573 K. It was found that the thermal resolution increases with temperature from 0.38 K to 1.38 K, which was adequate for most applications. As the accuracy of the optical temperature sensor is affected by the material's maximal phonon energy,54 the observed temperature accuracy of about <2 K on increasing the temperature for Er3+/Yb3+Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors makes it a potential material for fabricating sensors that can withstand extreme temperatures.
Another optical parameter on which the above outcomes can rely more is the repeatability of FIR given by the expression,55 (26)

Δ
m is the average value of FIR whereas the FIR value in five repeated radiation cycles is given by Δi. The FIR values in five consecutive cycles are shown in Fig. 3(c). The calculated R values at 300 K and 573 K exhibited excellent thermal repeatability (R > 99%).
Moreover, the heat generated in phosphors upon increasing the pump power was investigated using the expression,6 (27)
The FIR at each pump power of TCLs, and values of ΔE and A from the temperature dependence study provided the developed temperature gain. The higher pump power density causes the generation of phonons by increasing the non-radiative transitions, which is the primary cause of the generation of heat. In the Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors, the FIR varies from 0.40 to 0.81 upon increasing the pump power density from 0.39 to 51.69 W cm−2. The highest temperature gain was noted to be 384 K at 51.69 W cm−2. It is known that for photothermal medical diagnosis, the desired temperature range is 315 to 318 K. Thus, tuning the pump power allows suitable heat to be generated and utilized for hyperthermia-based cancer treatment.39 However, the implementation of the prepared phosphors still lacks medical trials.
Further, the critical aspect of any luminescence material is how it behaves with the increase of temperature. The UC spectra of the phosphors by varying the temperature in the 300–573 K range have been monitored to find the thermal stability of the developed phosphors. It is observed that UC spectra have a decreasing trend as the temperature increases. For improved comprehension of thermal behavior, the activation energy has been determined using the following Arrhenius equation,33,59 (28)where I0 and I are the emission intensities at the initial and testing temperature, ‘C’ is a constant, EA represents the activation energy and ‘k’ stand for the Boltzmann constant (8.629 × 10−5 eV K−1). The calculated values of EA were ∼0.37 eV and ∼0.40 eV for Er3+/Yb3+:Bi2WO6 and Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors, respectively. The increased activation energy of the Er3+ and Yb3+-codoped phosphors ensured that the thermal stability was improved with the incorporation of Mo6+ ions. Thus, the present phosphors show stability with a high activation energy as compared to the reported works.22,60 A greater activation energy makes the Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors thermally stable and resistant to quenching. Again, the correlation between the probability of a non-radiative transition (α) and EA can be defined as,60 (29)where ‘s’ implies a constant, ‘T’ stands for temperature, and ‘k’ denotes the Boltzmann constant. The relation clarified that higher activation leads to less non-radiative transition.

4. Conclusion
In the successfully synthesized aurivillius-structured Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors, Bi3+ and W6+ sites are simultaneously substituted with Er3+/Yb3+ and Mo6+ ions. The green emission is enhanced ∼18 times after the addition of Yb3+ to Er3+:Bi2WO6 phosphors. With the codoping of Mo6+ ions in the Er3+/Yb3+ codoped phosphors, the enhancement is ∼1.3 times, which is ∼27 times compared to that of Er3+:Bi2WO6 phosphors. The remarkable enrichment is due to the transfer of energy from the excited Yb3+–MoO42− dimer states to Er3+ ions. The absolute and relative sensitivities were maximized at 0.0050 K−1@403 K and 0.089 K−1@302 K, respectively, with a resolution of 0.38 K at room temperature and repeatability of FIR with >99%. The thermal stability was confirmed with the determined activation energy of ∼0.40 eV. The Er3+/Yb3+/Mo6+:Bi2WO6 phosphors with 96.3% colour purity and CIE coordinates (0.28, 0.70) appear promising for applications in frequency upconverter optical thermometry.
