    , Accepted 3rd September 2019First published on 9th September 2019AbstractCuBi2O4 with a suitable optical bandgap and positive onset potential is a promising photocathode material for solar hydrogen evolution, while fine control of the morphology and chemical composition (Cu/Bi ratio) is currently still highly desirable for pursuing its high photoelectrochemical performance. Here, we demonstrate the facile synthesis of high-quality nanoporous CuBi2O4 films through spin coating with a vividly controlled morphology and Cu/Bi composition. Through systematic analysis of energy bands, we found that the electronic structure of CuBi2O4 was much sensitive to the variation of the Cu/Bi ratio, which could result in different photoelectrochemical performances. The nanoporous CuBi2O4 films with enhanced light absorption and a shortened carrier diffusion pathway exhibited a high photocurrent density of up to 2.45 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode with H2O2 as a sacrificial agent. By further optimizing the chemical compositions, the photocurrent density of the film with a Cu/Bi ratio of 0.55 could increase to 2.66 mA cm−2, which is among the top recorded values of CuBi2O4 based photocathodes. This work reveals the significance of rational control of the morphology and chemical composition for the development of highly efficient CuBi2O4 photoelectrodes.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting that utilizes sunlight to convert water into hydrogen fuel is an attractive technique for renewable energy conversion and storage.1–5 A multitude of n-type metal oxide semiconductors such as TiO2, Fe2O3, and BiVO4 (ref. 6–12) have been intensively explored as photoanodes for water splitting. To fulfil highly efficient unbiased solar water splitting, a p-type metal oxide semiconductor with a smaller bandgap is highly desirable as a photocathode in a tandem cell configuration. CuBi2O4 (CBO) has attracted increasing attention as a photocathode material for solar hydrogen evolution owing to its attractive band structure and material properties. First, it has an optimal bandgap in the range of 1.5–1.8 eV with a maximum theoretical AM1.5G photocurrent of up to 19.7–29.0 mA cm−2, which can absorb a large portion of visible light in the solar spectrum.13–16 Second, its conduction band is confirmed to be at a more negative potential than the water reduction potential and the valence band is located at a more positive potential than that of other photocathode materials, like p-Si, p-GaP, and Cu-based metal oxides, which exhibit particularly a positive flat band potential near +1 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).17–21
CuBi2O4 has a relatively deep light penetration depth of ∼280 nm at 550 nm,15,24 while it has a limited charge carrier (minor electrons) diffusion length at the scale of 10–50 nm due to its low carrier mobility (∼1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1),14,20 which leads to the recombination of most photogenerated electron–hole pairs in dense and thick CuBi2O4 films. Nanostructuring is an effective strategy to increase the carrier separation efficiency for photoelectrodes, which can improve light utilization by enhancing light scattering and shorten the electron diffusion pathway to the interface for hydrogen evolution reactions.22 Most of the reported porous CuBi2O4 films that were prepared by drop-casting or electro-deposition methods showed an irregular structure and/or incomplete substrate coverage,23–27 which usually lead to low photocurrent densities. Therefore, a facile method for the fabrication of a high-quality nanoporous film is of importance for developing high performance CuBi2O4 photocathodes. In addition to the morphology of the photoelectrode, the ratio of the component elements plays a significant role in its PEC performance, particularly in cases of ternary oxides.28 For example, a Cu:Bi ratio of 3:2 in CuBi2O4 will result in CuO phase segregation, which could act as hole-selective contacts for improved PEC performance.29 To unravel the fundamental material properties and thereby quantify performance limiting factors of CuBi2O4, a systematic study on clarifying how the composition influences its material properties and ultimately the PEC performance is thus highly desirable.
In this work, we develop a simple spin coating method for synthesizing high-quality nanoporous CuBi2O4 films and performed compositional engineering of the Cu/Bi ratio. By adjusting the F-108 concentration, a uniform nanoporous CuBi2O4 film was obtained and its morphology was further optimized by adding appropriate amounts of ethylene glycol to the precursor. The nanoporous CuBi2O4 films with enhanced light absorption and a shortened carrier diffusion pathway exhibited a high photocurrent density of 2.45 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE for the hydrogen reduction with H2O2 as a sacrificial agent. It was found that the electronic structure of CuBi2O4 was much sensitive to the variation of the Cu/Bi ratio, which could result in different PEC performances. By further optimizing the chemical composition, the photocurrent density of the CuBi2O4 film with a Cu/Bi ratio of 0.55 could increase up to 2.66 mA cm−2, which is among the top values of this material. Thus this work reveals the significance of rational control of the morphology and chemical composition for developing highly efficient CuBi2O4 photoelectrodes.
Results and discussion
Optimization of the spin-coating method for nanoporous CuBi2O4 photocathodes

Fig. 1a schematically shows the synthesis of nanoporous thin films of pure tetragonal CuBi2O4. Briefly, the precursor solution containing Bi(NO3)3 and Cu(NO3)2 plus the triblock copolymer Pluronic F-108 was coated onto FTO substrates, which were then preheated at 150 °C for 10 min and subsequently annealed at 450 °C in air for 1 hour. Spin coating is a simple and convenient method for fabrication of thin films, but it has certain requirements of the concentration, viscosity and spreadability of the precursor solution. Previously reported solution-based drop casting and spray pyrolysis methods for preparing CuBi2O4 films typically used acetic acid and ethanol as solvents to dissolve Bi(NO3)3 and Cu(NO3)2, respectively.11,12 However, the limited solubility of Cu2+ and Bi3+ and low viscosity of the precursor solution are not suitable for spin coating. Fig. 1b shows the SEM image of a CuBi2O4 film with 0.15 M ethanol and acetic acid (2:1 by volume) precursor solution after repeating spin-coating five times. It can be seen from the inset of Fig. 1b that the film is almost transparent, and it becomes very uneven after spin coating multiple times, indicating that this precursor solution is not suitable for spin coating a high-quality CuBi2O4 film.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration of the fabrication procedure of CuBi2O4 photocathodes. SEM images of CuBi2O4 films by spin coating 0.15 M precursor solution with various F-108 concentrations: (b) no F-108 (CBO), (c) 0.1 g mL−1 F-108 (CBO-F-108-2), and (d) 0.15 g mL−1 F-108 (CBO-F-108-3). SEM images of CuBi2O4 films by spin coating 0.15 M precursor solution with 0.1 g mL−1 F-108 and different amounts of ethylene glycol: (e) 20% (CBO-EG-1), (f) 35% (CBO-EG-2) and (g) 50% (CBO-EG-3) by volume of the total solution. 
The extremely thin film with little light absorption would result in poor PEC performance (Fig. S1 and S13†), and the copolymer can effectively improve the viscosity of the solution to obtain a thick film. Thus, different concentrations of triblock copolymer F-108 (0.05 g mL−1, 0.1 g mL−1 and 0.15 g mL−1) were added to the precursor solution, which are respectively denoted as CBO-F-108-1, CBO-F-108-2 and CBO-F-108-3. It can be clearly seen that CuBi2O4 films become dark brown after the addition of F-108 (insets of Fig. S2,†1c and d), indicating the significant increase of the film thickness. In addition to the increase of film thickness, we also found that the films formed uniform nanoporous structures, because the template agent F-108 could decompose, leaving the space it occupies when annealed above 350 °C (Fig. S3†). Therefore, by regulating F-108 concentrations in the precursor solution, we can control the size of the pores and the morphology of the film. SEM images of CuBi2O4 films with different F-108 concentrations are shown in Fig. S1,† 1c and 1d, exhibiting nanoporous films with worm-like particles dispersed on the substrate. When an F-108 concentration of 0.1 g mL−1 is added, the elongated worm-like particles are densely and evenly distributed on the substrate (Fig. 1c). A less F-108 concentration of 0.05 g mL−1 will result in a film with fewer pores, where many particles are connected to each other, exposing some uncovered FTO substrate (Fig. S2a†), while an excess F-108 concentration of 0.15 g mL−1 will lead to relatively fine particles unevenly distributed on the FTO substrate, and some parts of the substrate still were not covered (Fig. 1e). Further increasing the F-108 concentration to 0.25 mg mL−1 will cause the exposure of a large area of the FTO substrate (Fig. S2b†). Thus, we assume that 0.1 g mL−1 F-108 is an appropriate concentration to fabricate CuBi2O4 films, which show the optimized morphology among these films.
By adding F-108, not only the solution properties were changed, but also a nanoporous film was obtained, which offers an enhanced surface area to enable increased active reaction sites and ensures rapid charge separation and diffusion of electrons to the surface while inhibiting light absorption loss.24 However, this precursor solution of acetic acid and ethanol containing Bi(NO3)3 and Cu(NO3)2 is stable for only a few hours and starts to decompose to produce white precipitates, as shown in the photographs of the precursor solutions aged for different time periods (Fig. S4†). This phenomenon has also been reported in previous literature studies, since Bi(NO3)3 is very sensitive and easy to hydrolyse with water to form bismuth subnitrates.15,24 The large particles formed by the hydrolysis of Bi(NO3)3 will make the spin-coated film non-uniform (Fig. S5†), because the precursor takes a long time to be dissolved to obtain a uniform precursor solution. We therefore attempted to improve the stability of the solution by modifying the composition of the precursor solvent. As both Bi(NO3)3 and Cu(NO3)2 have good solubility in ethylene glycol, different amounts of ethylene glycol (20%, 35% and 50% of volume in total solution) are added to the precursor solution, denoted as CBO-EG-1, CBO-EG-2 and CBO-EG-3. As shown in Fig. S4,† the precursor solution produced a white precipitate after three hours in the absence of ethylene glycol, while the precursor solution with 35% ethylene glycol was very stable and there was no precipitation for several days (Fig. S6†). The main reason could be that bismuth ions can be complexed by the two hydroxyl groups on the ethylene glycol, thereby avoiding hydrolysis and polycondensation with water.
The addition of ethylene glycol also has great influence on the morphology of the CuBi2O4 film. Fig. 1e–g show the SEM images of CBO-EG-1, CBO-EG-2 and CBO-EG-3 films with 0.1 g mL−1 F-108 in precursor solution. Note that we kept the precursor concentration constant by adding a certain volume of ethylene glycol while maintaining the same volume of ethanol. Worm-like particles are uniformly and densely grown on the entire FTO substrate of CBO-EG-1, CBO-EG-2 with a small amount of ethylene glycol. As shown in Fig. 2e and f, many particles grow in a direction perpendicular to the substrate for CBO-EG-1 and CBO-EG-2 films, which are different from the horizontal growth in the case without using EG (Fig. 1c). We assume that the perpendicular growth of the particles is very favourable for the contact between the film and electrolyte and the light utilization. Further increasing the amount of ethylene glycol in CBO-EG-3 results in the formation of a dense film with tens of nanometres of secondary grains on the surface (Fig. 1g). An interesting phenomenon is that as the amount of ethylene glycol increases, the films become more transparent (insets of Fig. 1e–g), while the film is matte and exhibits strong light scattering when no ethylene glycol was added to the precursor solution. The electric double layer capacitance calculated by the CV method was used to estimate the area of these samples. As shown in Fig. S7,† CV curves and the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of different CuBi2O4 films are demonstrated. Clearly, the linear slope (Fig. S7d†) is 165, 560 and 797 μF cm−2 for CBO, CBO-F-108-2 and CBO-EG-2 photocathodes, respectively. The electrochemically active surface area of CBO-EG-2 is much larger than that of the CBO sample, indicating that the CBO-EG-2 film can provide more active sites during the electrochemical process.

(d) Chopped LSV scans of CBO-EG-2 performed in 0.3 M K2SO4 and 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.65) back AM1.5 illumination. 
The crystal phase of the as-prepared films was investigated by X-ray diffraction, as shown in Fig. S8.† In addition to the diffraction peaks FTO, all samples have broad peaks at 20.88°, 28.01°, and 46.7°, corresponding to (200), (211), and (411) of tetragonal CuBi2O4 (PDF#01-080-0996), respectively. This reveals that F-108 and ethylene glycol have little effect on the crystallization of the CuBi2O4 film. The elemental composition of the CBO-EG-2 film was further confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in cross-sectional SEM (SEM-EDS) and Cu and Bi evenly distributed throughout the film, indicating the uniform chemical composition of the film (Fig. S9 and S10†).
As morphological details and interfacial structures of polycrystalline films are supposed to have significant influence on their PEC properties, we compared the PEC performance of the films with different morphologies. The PEC performances of the as-prepared CuBi2O4 photocathodes were tested in a three-electrode PEC cell in 0.3 M K2SO4 and 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.65) with H2O2. We chose H2O2 as an electron scavenger because it is reported to undergo more facile reduction (0.815 VRHE) by photogenerated electrons than proton reduction (0 VRHE) at the surface of CuBi2O4,14 thereby enabling the investigation of the PEC properties of CuBi2O4 electrodes without complications from slow surface reactions and surface recombination. Fig. 2a shows a chopped linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) scan of CuBi2O4 films prepared with various F-108 concentrations in precursor solution under AM1.5 illumination from the back (FTO substrate side). All CuBi2O4 photocathodes show a clear photocurrent onset above 1.0 VRHE with H2O2 added to the electrolyte. For the precursor solution with less F-108, the film is thin and has small specific surface area, and the photocurrent density of CBO-F-108-1 is only 0.9 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE. For the precursor solution with more F-108, a lower photocurrent density of 0.75 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE is achieved due to the incomplete coverage of the substrate, though the film of CBO-F-108-3 has strong light absorption. CBO-F-108-2 with worm-like particles densely and evenly distributed on the substrate shows a higher photocurrent density of 1.4 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE, which indicates that the film morphology plays an important role in its PEC performance.
The morphology of the films was further optimized by the addition of ethylene glycol to the precursor solution, and the corresponding photocurrent densities are shown in Fig. 2b. The photocurrent densities of CBO-EG-1 and CBO-EG-2 with higher specific surface area and dense uniform particle distribution are 1.75 and 2.0 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE respectively, higher than those without ethylene glycol, while CBO-EG-3 with dense films shows a lower photocurrent density of 1.1 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE. CBO-EG-2 with large worm-like particles and good crystallinity demonstrates the highest PEC performance among these films. For CBO-EG-2, back illumination exhibits higher photocurrent (2.0 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE) than front-side illumination (1.65 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE), as shown in Fig. 2c, because of the insufficient hole transport and the longer average transport distance for the photogenerated holes in the front-illumination configuration.15,20 We also studied the effect of different calcination temperatures on the PEC performance and the CuBi2O4 film calcined at 450 °C with relatively large specific surface area and good crystallinity demonstrates the highest photocurrent density (Fig. S11†). Besides, we performed the PEC measurements in 0.3 M K2SO4 and 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.65) without H2O2, as shown in Fig. 2d. The photocurrent density is relatively low for back illumination (0.3 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE), which indicates the severe recombination of electrons and holes on the surface of the CuBi2O4 photocathode.
Thickness optimization of nanoporous CuBi2O4 photocathode films
By optimizing the composition of the spin-coating precursor solution, we can successfully prepare high-quality nanoporous CuBi2O4 films with high PEC performance. However, a limited charge carrier diffusion length of CuBi2O4 will result in the recombination of most photogenerated electron–hole pairs in dense and thick films. To evaluate the trade-off between light absorption and charge carrier transfer, we further pursued to fabricate a series of nanoporous CuBi2O4 films with different thicknesses and cross-sectional SEM images of these samples are shown in Fig. 3a–c. We adjusted the thickness of the film by changing the concentrations of the solution and rotation speeds of spin-coating, and the specific experimental parameters are shown in Table S1.† In brief, the precursor concentrations for preparing 150, 300, and 400 nm thickness films are 0.12, 0.18 and 0.225 M and the F-108 concentrations are 0.1, 0.2, and 0.225 mg mL−1, increasing proportionally to the precursor concentration. Other experimental parameters including solvent composition, and preheating and calcination temperatures were kept unchanged. All these films exhibit a similar nanoporous structure, except that the particle sizes are slightly different (Fig. S12†). The light absorption of these CuBi2O4 photocathodes is shown in Fig. 3d. All three films with different thicknesses display a very broad light absorption of up to 800 nm. They show a gradual and linear increase in absorption at wavelengths greater than 600 nm and a steep initial increase in absorption at wavelengths shorter than 600 nm. As the film thickness increases from 150 to 300 nm, the light absorption is significantly enhanced, especially when the wavelength is shorter than 600 nm.

(d) Absorption spectra and (e) chopped (light/dark) LSV scans for nanoporous CuBi2O4 films with different thicknesses. (f) IPCE spectra for CuBi2O4 films performed in 0.3 M K2SO4 and 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.65) with H2O2 and with back AM1.5 illumination. 

Fig. 3e shows a chopped LSV scan for CuBi2O4 photocathodes with different thicknesses (back illumination). The ∼300 nm CuBi2O4 photocathode shows a higher photocurrent than ∼150 nm and ∼400 nm photocathodes. At 0.6 VRHE, the ∼300 nm CuBi2O4 photocathode yields a photocurrent density of −2.45 mA cm−2 (back illumination), which is much higher than the −1.9 mA cm−2 for the 150 nm CuBi2O4 photocathodes and the −2.25 mA cm−2 for the 400 nm CuBi2O4 photocathodes. The quantum efficiency of each CuBi2O4 photocathode was determined by measuring the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE). Fig. 3f shows the IPCE spectra of each photocathode measured at 0.6 VRHE under back illumination. Overall, the IPCE value in the wavelength range longer than 600 nm is less than 5%, while the value is as high as 30% or more in the short wavelength range (less than 450 nm), which is consistent with light absorption, as shown in Fig. 3d. For the region of 350 to 500 nm, the ∼300 nm CuBi2O4 photocathode shows significantly higher IPCE than the CuBi2O4 photocathode with 150 nm thickness, due to the significant increase in light absorption (Fig. 3d). As the film thickness increases to 400 nm, the light absorption is further enhanced, while the IPCE is lowered, which is consistent with the overall PEC performance. This suggests that most of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs recombined in the bulk of the film prior to reaching the interface of the semiconductor and the electrolyte for thicker films.
Cu/Bi stoichiometry-controlled CuBi2O4 photocathodes
In addition to the microscopic morphology of the CuBi2O4 film, chemical composition (Cu/Bi ratio) is another important factor influencing its PEC performance. We fabricated 300 nm thick CuBi2O4 photocathodes with different Cu/Bi ratios using the optimized spin coating method from Table S1† and the ratio of the CuBi2O4 films was tuned by adjusting the molar ratio of Bi(NO3)3 and Cu(NO3)2 in the precursor solution. CuBi2O4 films with different Cu/Bi ratios (MCu/MBi = 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, 0.55 and 0.60) were prepared, which are referred to as 0.40 CBO, 0.45 CBO, 0.50 CBO, 0.55 CBO, and 0.60 CBO.
From a digital photograph of the fabricated CuBi2O4 samples (Fig. S14†), it is evident that the CuBi2O4 films became much more transparent if the Cu/Bi molar ratio increased above 0.5. Quantitative evaluation of the transmittance of the films using UV-vis spectra shown in Fig. 4a also revealed that the films with a Cu/Bi molar ratio higher than 0.5 exhibited a higher transmittance value than 0.4, 0.45 and 0.5 CBO. This was probably because a small change of the Cu/Bi ratio results in slightly different chemical compositions and microscopic morphologies of CuBi2O4 films (Fig. S15†). Tauc plots obtained from UV/vis diffuse absorbance spectra in Fig. S16b† revealed that the optical bandgap of the CuBi2O4 samples slightly increased with an increase in the Cu/Bi molar ratio from 1.57 eV for 0.4 and 0.45 CBO to 1.60 eV for 0.5 CBO. However, when the ratio of Cu to Bi exceeds 0.5, the bandgap increased to 1.70 and 1.67 eV for 0.55 and 0.6 CBO, respectively.

(b) Chopped LSV curves of the CuBi2O4 samples under back-side illumination performed in 0.3 M K2SO4 and 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.65) with H2O2 and back AM1.5 illumination. (c) XRD diffractograms and (d) Raman spectra of the fabricated photocathodes. 
PEC measurements of CuBi2O4 photocathodes with different Cu/Bi ratios were performed. As seen from the LSV curves of Fig. 3h, the photocurrent of the CuBi2O4 photocathodes was dramatically enhanced as the Cu/Bi molar ratio increased from 0.4 to 0.55 and then decreased with a further increase in the molar ratio to 0.6; the photocurrent density was 0.84, 1.61, 2.45, 2.66, and 1.91 mA cm−2 for 0.4 CBO, 0.45 CBO, 0.5 CBO, 0.55 CBO, and 0.6 CBO at 0.6 VRHE with H2O2 under back-side illumination, respectively. It should be mentioned that the photocurrent density of −2.66 mA cm−2 achieved in the present work is among the top values thus far reported for CuBi2O4 based photocathodes (Table S5†).
To check the crystal structure and phase composition of CuBi2O4 films with different Cu/Bi molar ratios, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman analysis were performed. The XRD pattern shown in Fig. 4c confirms that all samples with different Cu/Bi stoichiometries have strong peaks at 20.88°, 28.01°, and 46.7° assigned to the (200), (211), and (411) lattice planes of tetragonal CuBi2O4 (PDF# 01-080-0996), respectively. Because of the excess amount of Bi, an additional peak of 0.4 CBO is visible at 29.22° in the magnified XRD pattern (Fig. S17†), which can be assigned to the (020) lattice planes of Bi2O2.33 (PDF # 00-027-0051). However, the presence of CuO was not observed in the XRD patterns of 0.55 and 0.6 CBO in Fig. 4c. Fig. 4d shows the Raman spectra of the different CuBi2O4 samples. The main Raman bands for CuBi2O4 centred at ∼131, 261, 403, and 588 cm−1 were observed for all different Cu/Bi stoichiometry samples, and there are also no Raman peaks of CuO observed.30,31 This indicates that a slight change in the Cu/Bi ratio has little influence on the crystal structure of CuBi2O4 films, so there must be other reasons why different Cu/Bi ratio samples exhibit dramatically various PEC performances.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted to investigate the charge transport properties of the CuBi2O4 samples. As shown in the Nyquist plots in Fig. 5a, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the CuBi2O4 samples, which was estimated from the diameter of the semi-circles in the plot, significantly decreased from ∼15000 Ω (0.4 CBO) to ∼4980 Ω (0.55 CBO); the entire list of the estimated resistance is shown in Table S2.† Consistent with the LSV measurements, 0.55 CBO samples exhibited much faster charge transfer properties. As shown in Fig. 5b, Mott–Schottky (MS) plots for all samples were measured in 0.3 M K2SO4 and 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.65) at 7 kHz (Fig. 5b). The extrapolated x-axis intercept of the MS plot can be used to estimate the flat-band potential and the Fermi level (Ef) while considering the potential drop across the Helmholtz layer. From the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot, the acceptor density (NA) is estimated. As shown in Table S3,† the 0.55 CBO sample has the highest carrier concentration of 4.2 × 1018 cm−3 compared with other Cu/Bi ratio samples (∼1.7 and 2.3 × 1018 cm−3 for 0.4 and 0.45 CBO samples; 2.4 and 2.5 × 1018 cm−3 for 0.5 and 0.6 CBO samples). In addition, the flat band potential of the 0.55 CBO sample is between 1.25 and 1.3 VRHE, indicating that it has a very low initial potential.

Fig. 5c shows the UPS spectrum of CuBi2O4 films with different Cu/Bi ratios deposited on FTO substrates. The work function is defined as the difference value between the vacuum energy level and Fermi level, which can be calculated from the low kinetic energy cutoff in the secondary emission feature. The photon energy of the UV source (He I discharge) is 21.21 eV. Given that the Fermi level at the surface of CuBi2O4 films is independent, thus the work functions of 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, and 0.6 CBO can be determined to be 4.69, 4.82, 4.92, 5.11, and 4.81 eV, respectively. Using 4.5 eV vs. vacuum as the reference value for the electrochemical reduction of water (0.0 VRHE), Fermi levels of 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, and 0.6 CBO are located at 0.19, 0.32, 0.42, 0.61, and 0.31 eV vs. RHE. The positions of the VBM were estimated to be 0.97, 0.92, 1.1, 1.01, and 0.86 eV using magnified UPS spectra in Fig. S18b.† Using the Fermi level and VBM, along with the measured bandgap, we constructed band diagrams of these CuBi2O4 samples with different Cu/Bi ratios and the band diagrams are shown in Fig. 5d. It is vividly shown that a small variation of the Cu/Bi ratio has a significant impact on the band structure of CuBi2O4. As we know, the depletion width and the electric field strength in a semiconductor can effectively separate charge carriers generated by the absorption of light, depending on the initial energy difference between the Fermi level of the semiconductor and the value of −qE(A/A−).2 0.55 CBO has a lower Fermi level than other samples, showing the largest initial energy difference from E(H+/H2). Compared with other samples, the widest depletion width of 0.55 CBO can efficiently separate electron–hole pairs, thus demonstrating the highest PEC performance.
As shown in Fig. S19,† the photocurrent density was 0.35 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE at the beginning, and then experienced an immediate decay to about 0.12 mA cm−2 within the first 5 minutes. This was probably due to the slow kinetics of water reduction, i.e., slow electron transfer across the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. Accumulation of electrons on the surface of the film during long-term testing results in increased recombination of electrons and holes on the surface of the film. Then, the current value remains stable at 0.12 mA cm−2 and there was no obvious decline. Our nanoporous CuBi2O4 films are thus stable under the photoelectrochemical measurement conditions without any H2O2 sacrificial agent, compared with the previous work.20 Raman spectra in Fig. S19b† indicate that the phase of the CuBi2O4 film did not change. As shown in Fig. S19c and d,† the CuBi2O4 particles were round and smooth before the test, and the worm-like structure was well retained and the morphology did not change much after the test, except that some particles became rough (probably due to the attachment of the unwashed electrolyte). SEM-EDS mapping of the 0.55 CBO photocathode after testing show that Cu, Bi and O evenly distributed across the film (Fig. S20†), indicating that CuBi2O4 did not decompose after the photoelectrochemical test.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a new spin coating method to prepare high-quality nanoporous CuBi2O4 photocathodes. To optimize the method, significant challenges in the spin coating process were addressed. The viscosity of the precursor solution was adjusted by adding appropriate amounts of F-108 to meet the requirements of the spin coating process, and the F-108 concentration was adjusted to optimize the morphology of the film. Ethylene glycol was introduced into the precursor solution to prevent the hydrolysis of Bi3+ and enhance the stability of the solution from 3 h to several days, and the morphology of the film was further optimized by adjusting the ratio of the solvent. By evaluating the trade-off between light absorption and charge carrier transfer, 300 nm thick nanoporous CuBi2O4 films exhibited the optimized thicknesses with AM1.5 photocurrent densities of up to 2.45 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE under back illumination with H2O2 as an electron scavenger. Investigation of CuBi2O4 photocathodes with different Cu/Bi ratios revealed that Bi-deficient CuBi2O4 (a Cu/Bi ratio of 0.55) exhibited higher PEC. The nanoporous CuBi2O4 thin film photocathodes with an optimized Cu/Bi ratio (0.55) produce AM1.5 photocurrent densities of up to 2.66 mA cm−2 at 0.6 VRHE under back illumination with H2O2, which is among the top values of this material. This work reveals the significance of rational control of the morphology and chemical composition of CuBi2O4 for the development of highly efficient photoelectrodes.
Experimental
Materials synthesis
Nanoporous CuBi2O4 films were prepared by a spin coating method, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a. Typically, for preparing the 300 nm nanoporous CuBi2O4 film, 0.54 mmol Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a solution mixture containing 0.5 mL ethylene glycol (99%, Sigma Aldrich) and 0.5 mL acetic acid (>99.7%, Fisher Scientific) and then sonicated for 20 minutes to obtain a clear and colorless solution. Subsequently, 0.5 mL absolute ethanol (>99.7%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.) and 0.27 mmol Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (99–104%, Sigma-Aldrich) were added into the above solution and sonicated for another 20 minutes. Next, 250 mg of the triblock copolymer pluronic F-108 (average Mn ∼ 14600, 82.5 wt% PEG, Aldrich) was added to serve as a structure directing agent for preparing nanoporous structures. After sonication for 30 minutes, a light blue, viscous solution can be obtained and used for the following spin coating. The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (∼30 Ω sq−1, Pilkington) substrates were cleaned by sonication for 15 min in 1 vol% Triton, acetone, and ethanol, sequentially, and finally dried using nitrogen flow. The spin coating was performed in two consecutive steps with 1500 rpm for 15 seconds and 3500 rpm for 40 seconds, and then the samples were baked on a hotplate at 150 °C for 10 minutes and annealed in air at 450 °C for 1 hour at the heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Finally, the 300 nm CuBi2O4 film can be obtained after cooling down to room temperature naturally. Other films can be prepared by adjusting the experimental parameters described in the article.
Materials characterization
The crystal structures of the films were characterized using X-ray diffraction spectra (XRD, X'pert PRO, Panalytical) in the 2θ range from 10° to 70° with Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm) radiation at room temperature. The morphology of the films was analyzed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Verios G4), operated at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV with an Oxford Instruments EDS detector. The absorbance was measured using an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV-vis-NIR). The Raman spectra were obtained using a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope with a 532 nm laser. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was conducted using a He I source (E = 21.21 eV) with the same hemispherical analyser (Kratos, AXIS Supra) in an ultrahigh vacuum system (He partial pressure ∼10−8 mbar).
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical measurements were all carried out using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E) and a three-electrode configuration, with the CuBi2O4 film as the working electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode, and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. The light source used was a Xe 500 W lamp (CEL-S500, CEAULIGHT) with an AM1.5G filter (100 mW cm−2). Typically, the exposed area of the photoelectrode was 0.26 cm2. For photocurrent measurements, samples were tested in 0.3 M K2SO4 and 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.65). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) characteristics were recorded by scanning the potential from −0.2 to 0.7 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 under irradiation.
All potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the Nernstian relation, VRHE = VAg/AgCl + 0.0591 × pH + 0.197 (V)(1)
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed using the same three-electrode cell at 0.6 V vs. RHE. The simulated illumination source consisted of a full solar simulator (CEL-S500, CEAULIGHT) and a motorized monochromator (CEL-IS302, CEAULIGHT). IPCE values were calculated using the following formula: IPCE (%) = (J × 1240)/(λ × Plight) × 100%(2)where J represents the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) and λ and Plight are the incident light wavelength (nm) and the corresponding power density (mW cm−2), respectively.
Mott–Schottky measurements and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were performed in a frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 Hz at 0.6 V vs. RHE. Mott–Schottky (MS) measurements were performed in the dark with frequencies of 7 kHz at 0.6 V vs. RHE. Mott–Schottky plots were constructed based on the following relationship, 1/C2 = (2/qε0εNA) × (−φ + φfb − kT/q)(3)where C is the capacitance (F m−2), ε is the relative permittivity or dielectric constant, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, NA is the acceptor density (m−3), and φfb is the flat-band potential (V vs. reference). Here, a relative permittivity value of 80 was used for CuBi2O4.14
