    , Accepted 3rd January 2020First published on 6th January 2020AbstractIn this study, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPOL) is presented as an additive to modify a polytriarylamine-based hole transport layer (HTL) for perovskite solar cells assembled in a regular n–i–p configuration. When the electrode-free stacks are exposed to air, TEMPOL catalyzes the oxygen doping of the HTL and enhances the photovoltaic performance of the devices. The TEMPOL-induced doping of the polymeric HTL improves the open-circuit voltage and hence the power conversion efficiency of the solar cells, reaching a maximum of 17.5% for the bication Cs0.12FA0.88PbI2.64Br0.36 perovskite absorber. Moreover, TEMPOL shows no negative effect on the photostability of the solar cells, allowing them to reach T80 > 2000 hours under continuous 30 mW cm−2 illumination.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells represent an important discovery of the recent decade that has attracted significant attention of the scientific community due to the high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and ease of fabrication of these devices. A conventional perovskite solar cell (PSC) architecture utilizes light absorbers with the perovskite structure ABX3, where A is methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA) or cesium cations, B is usually lead and X is bromide, chloride or iodide. While the PCEs of perovskite and silicon solar cells are comparable, the major drawback of PSCs is the short device lifetime, which hinders their massive application. All inorganic perovskites1,2 or quantum dot architectures,3,4 although they are more stable, so far deliver much lower photovoltaic performance. The degradation of hybrid perovskite solar cells usually depends on multiple contributions from simultaneous processes such as intrinsic decomposition of the perovskite layer under light exposure,5 elevated temperature or electric fields;6 the degradation of the interfaces adjacent to the perovskite layer7 or electrodes and extrinsic decomposition through the reactions with oxygen or moisture.8
In particular, the hole-transport layer (HTL)/perovskite interface is problematic due to the severe degradation processes induced by additives such as lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and tert-butylpyridine (tBuPy).9–13 Two of the most commonly used HTLs, which show optimal band alignment with hybrid lead halide perovskites, are represented by polytriarylamines (PTA(A)) and spiro-OMeTAD,14 which do not have sufficient hole mobility to yield efficient devices without additional doping.15 Therefore, intensive research has been focused on developing suitable dopants that improve the charge transport properties of organic HTLs and do not degrade the perovskite absorbers. Previously, it has been found that the t-BuPy additive induces the degradation of the perovskite/HTL interface, while the LiTFSI additive is responsible for moisture-induced decomposition due to its high hygroscopicity.16 When t-BuPy was replaced by 2-amylpyridine, the cells kept their initial PCE for up to 1000 hours when stored in the dark under an inert atmosphere.16 Another study showed an application of tetrabutylammonium salts to replace entirely the conventional LiTFSI/t-BuPy dopant mixture.17 The PSC showed enhanced thermal stability, however still lost more than 30% PCE upon annealing at 85 °C for 30 minutes. Considerable stabilization of the devices was also observed when LiTFSI was replaced with the less hygroscopic AgTFSI salt.18
It should be emphasized that numerous other dopants can be used to modify spiro-OMeTAD in combination with LiTFSI to increase further the conductivity of HTL films.15,19,20 In particular, Cu21 and Co-complexes,22 benzoyl peroxide23 and iron salts24 were introduced as dopants or additives, improving the spiro-OMeTAD electrical performance. Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane was also used for spiro-OMeTAD25 and PTAA21 doping in combination with Li salts to produce devices, which were stable in air for more than 70 days.
TEMPO was also recently employed to replace the FK209 additive for spiro-OMeTAD.26 Importantly, the authors claimed that the unreacted TEMPO volatilizes upon heating due to its low sublimation temperature, thus leaving a HTL with possibly only trace amounts of TEMPO.
On the contrary, we strongly believe that the presence of TEMPO(L) in the HTL structure is crucially important for its efficient operation. Our hypothesis is based on the fact that TEMPO derivatives, e.g. TEMPOL used in this work, can undergo facile oxidation in air at elevated temperatures. At the same time, the formed nitroxyl (oxoammonium) cations can transfer positive charge to the hole transporting polymer PTA, thus facilitating its doping. This doping strategy does not involve any metal-based ionic species (e.g. LiTFSI) or pyridine derivatives, therefore we expected to achieve superior operation stability of the HTL and entire perovskite solar cells.
Results and discussion
In this work, we used poly[bis(4-phenyl)(4-methylphenyl)amine] (PTA, Fig. 1A) with only one methyl group per repeating unit as a material for the hole transporting layer. We have shown recently that this polytriarylamine has better band alignment with respect to perovskite absorbers and delivers higher efficiencies in dopant-free perovskite solar cells as compared to conventional PTAA.27 However, our attempts to dope it with the conventional LiTFSI/t-BuPy system resulted in a strong deterioration of the solar cell performance, presumably due to the reported previously enhanced aggregation of LiTFSI in methyl-less PTA derivatives.28 Therefore, this was another strong reason to develop an alternative doping approach for PTA.

We selected TEMPOL as a promising additive which can facilitate oxygen-doping of PTA. The molecular structure of TEMPOL and the device architecture are presented in Fig. 1.
At the first stage, we explored the effect of TEMPOL addition to PTA on the performance of PSCs. A toluene solution of PTA was loaded with TEMPOL added in a concentration of 0.1–8 wt% with respect to the weight of PTA and this mixture was used for coating the HTL of perovskite solar cells. The Cs0.12FA0.88PbI2.64Br0.36 perovskite composition was selected due to its excellent thermal and presumably photochemical stability. While assembling the devices, we annealed the electrode-free stacks with a freshly deposited HTL in air at 95 °C for 10 min in order to induce oxygen doping.
The solar cells with the HTL based on the pristine PTA polymer showed an average open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 983 ± 24.9 mV, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 21.7 ± 0.5 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 68.7 ± 0.5% and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.7 ± 0.6% (Fig. 2). Incorporation of TEMPOL in the HTL gradually increased the device performance delivering a VOC of 1070 ± 10 mV, JSC of 22.6 ± 0.8 mA cm−2, FF of 69.5 ± 0.6% and PCE of 16.8 ± 0.7% at optimal 1.5% TEMPOL loading. A further increase in the TEMPOL concentration in the HTL led to a deterioration of the device performance.

The samples were annealed in air at 95 °C for 10 minutes prior to the electrode deposition. (B) IV curves of PSCs assembled with 1.5% TEMPOL addition to PTA and pristine PTA and (C) external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PSCs assembled with 1.5% TEMPOL addition to PTA and pristine PTA. 
The fact that incorporation of 1.5% of TEMPOL in the PTA-based HTL resulted in a nearly 2% increase in the PCE of the solar cells was particularly exciting, while the origin of this effect was not clear. We hypothesized that TEMPOL assisted in the oxidation of PTA during annealing of the samples in air since TEMPO derivatives are often used as catalysts for air-mediated oxidation.29
To explore further the possible oxygen doping behavior of PTA with 1.5% TEMPOL additive, we varied the time of the air exposure for the samples placed on a hotplate at 95 °C prior to MoO3/Ag electrode deposition. The evolution of the solar cell parameters as a function of annealing time is shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Evolution of the PV parameters of perovskite solar cells assembled with either pristine PTA or the PTA + 1.5% TEMPOL blend as the hole transport layer as a function of the sample annealing time at 95 °C in air prior to MoO3/Ag deposition. 
Initially, the non-annealed cells with the PTA/TEMPOL blend HTL showed a PCE of 13.3% ± 0.5, which was on average ∼2% higher than the value of 11.2 ± 0.4% obtained for the TEMPOL-free devices. Annealing in air improved the characteristics of all solar cells in a strongly time-dependent manner. The solar cells comprising TEMPOL in the HTL reached their top efficiency within 10 minutes of annealing, which suggests a relatively fast doping process. On the contrary, the TEMPO-free cells required 60 minutes of annealing to reach their optimal efficiency, thus implying that doping was much slower in that case.
If the increase in the open-circuit voltage is proportional to the rate of PTA doping with oxygen, the shape of the VOCversus annealing time plots reflects the HTL doping kinetics. It is seen from Fig. 3 that adding 1.5% of TEMPOL to PTA strongly accelerates its doping, reducing the time required to reach the maximal VOC by a factor of 3–4. Unfortunately, the fill factors of the cells decreased proportionally to the sample annealing time, which indicated the formation of deep traps hindering the charge transport in the stack and most likely also perovskite degradation in air.
To gain further insight into the nature of TEMPOL/PTA assembling within the HTL blend, we investigated the surface topography and surface potential of the electrode-free stacks using Kelvin probe force microscopy. Fig. 4 shows that the topography of the HTL coatings deposited on the perovskite films and based on pristine PTA or the TEMPOL/PTA blend has only minor differences, being within the sample-to-sample variation range. The work function values were 4.4 eV for both types of HTL films, thus confirming that TEMPOL does not modify the electronic properties of PTA by itself. Therefore, all obtained results support our hypothesis that TEMPOL only accelerates the doping of the HTL by oxygen during the thermal annealing of the samples in air.

To prove the oxidation of PTA with oxygen in the presence of TEMPOL, in situ Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was used. TEMPOL is a stable radical and has an intense signal in the ESR spectrum. During the heating in air, TEMPOL is partially oxidized to TEMPOL+ (the nitrosonium ion), which then oxidizes PTA (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  The proposed mechanism of the TEMPOL promoted PTA oxidation. 
The decrease in the intensity of the TEMPOL signal after heating of the PTA + TEMPOL film due to the partial oxidation of paramagnetic TEMPOL to diamagnetic TEMPOL+ supports this hypothesis (Fig. 5A).
 Fig. 5  ESR spectra of the PTA and PTA + TEMPOL films (A). ESR spectra of the PTA, TEMPOBF4, and PTA + TEMPOBF4 films (B). 
To confirm the oxidation of PTA with the TEMPOL+ intermediate, we designed an additional experiment. The oxidized form of TEMPO, TEMPO+BF4−, was used to oxidize PTA. While the ESR spectra of PTA and TEMPO+BF4− did not have any signals, the ESR spectrum of their mixture demonstrated pronounced signal of the TEMPO radical formed due to the reduction of TEMPO+ by PTA (Fig. 5B). The appearance of the intense signal at ∼450 nm in the UV-vis absorption spectra of PTA after the addition of TEMPO+BF4− also points to PTA oxidation (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†).
The fabricated solar cells were expected to show enhanced stability since the introduction of TEMPOL and following oxygen doping do not generate small mobile ions (e.g. like Li+ from LiTFSI) and do not require adding aggressive pyridine derivatives (e.g. like t-BuPy in the conventional recipe). To investigate the operation stability of the devices, we made a separate set of cells with an ITO/SnO2/Cs0.12FA0.88PbI2.64Br0.36/HTL/MoO3/Al configuration. The cells were then exposed to continuous illumination with 30 mW cm−2 white light at 45 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The PV parameters of the devices were regularly tracked and are shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Evolution of the PV parameters of the ITO/SnO2/Cs0.15FA0.85PbI2.55Br0.45/HTL/MoO3/Al devices under continuous illumination (30 mW cm−2, 45 °C). The UV portion of the light was filtered, in total 4 solar cells were tested for each HTL. 
It should be emphasized that the incorporation of TEMPOL in the HTL does not compromise the device stability as we can conclude from Fig. 6. Indeed, both types of solar cells with HTLs based on pristine PTA or the TEMPOL/PTA blend showed impressive stability with T80 > 2000 h, which can be considered as a highly promising result. Thus, we can conclude that the TEMPOL additive in the HTL does not affect the operation stability of perovskite solar cells, but strongly accelerates oxygen-induced doping of PTA and improves the efficiency of the devices.
Additionally, we also performed ambient stability tests for the solar cells using a similar configuration but Ag electrodes, since Al electrodes are very sensitive to moisture (Fig. S3, ESI†). Both solar cell types showed much faster degradation rates, as compared to the photostability tests, which can be attributed to the increased hydrophilicity of the MoO3 used as a component of the HTL. This should not be a problem with respect to practical applications since in commercial solar cells any moisture-related effects are suppressed using proper encapsulation.
Conclusion
We explored the application of TEMPOL as a modification additive to a polytriarylamine-based hole transport layer in n–i–p perovskite solar cells. It was found that the addition of TEMPOL improves all characteristics of the devices. In particular, PSCs based on the methylammonium-free bication absorber Cs0.12FA0.88PbI2.64Br0.36 delivered a PCE of 17.5% while using the optimal loading of TEMPOL (1.5 wt%) in PTA, which is almost 2% higher compared to the value of 15.6% obtained for the reference cells assembled with the TEMPOL-free HTL. TEMPOL also spectacularly increased the average open-circuit voltage of the cells by ∼90 mV thus suggesting improved charge extraction.
Our study has shown that TEMPOL does not affect the electronic properties of PTA but strongly accelerates its oxygen-induced doping. Importantly, the modification of the HTL with TEMPOL does not impair the operation stability of perovskite solar cells, which demonstrated an impressive T80 lifetime of >2000 h under continuous 30 mW cm−2 light exposure. The TEMPOL-promoted oxygen doping of PTA does not bring mobile ions or aggressive reagents into the system in contrast to traditional methods based on the application of lithium salts and pyridine derivatives. Therefore, we strongly believe that the approach presented in this work paves a way to the development of Li-free oxygen-doped HTLs for highly stable and efficient perovskite solar cells.
Experimental details
Preparation of precursor solutions
To prepare the Cs0.12FA0.88PbI2.64Br0.36 precursor solution, 0.104 g of CsBr, 0.6 g of FAI, 1.6 g of PbI2 and 0.184 g of PbBr2 were dissolved in a mixture of DMSO (280 μL) and DMF (1930 μL). The precursor solution was stirred at 80 °C for an hour, filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter and used within <4 days after the preparation.
Solar cell fabrication and characterization
Glass/ITO substrates (Kintec, 15 Ω sq−1) were sequentially cleaned with toluene, acetone, and isopropanol. Then, the ITO slides were treated with air plasma for 5 minutes and immediately coated with a tin oxide layer from a 10% aqueous suspension (Alfa-Aesar) by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 40 s followed by annealing at 165 °C in air for 15 minutes.
All subsequent steps were performed inside a glovebox. A solution of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (0.8 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds. Then the samples were annealed at 100 °C for 10 minutes. The perovskite precursor was spin coated at 4000 rpm and quenched with 130 μL of toluene dropped 18 seconds after the start. The films were annealed for 10 minutes at 100 °C on a hotplate. A solution of PTA (4 mg mL−1) or a PTA/TEMPOL blend was spin coated at 1000 rpm on top of the perovskite films. For the TEMPOL addition, a stock solution of TEMPOL (8 mg mL−1) in chlorobenzene was prepared and stored in a fridge. Before the coating of the HTL, an aliquot of TEMPOL solution was added to the PTA solution to reach the desired concentration. The mixture was stirred for 1–2 minutes and then used within 10 minutes. Afterward, the samples were taken outside the glovebox into the air and annealed on a hotplate at 95 °C (time specified in the text above). Molybdenum trioxide (15 nm)/silver (100 nm) electrodes were evaporated through a shadow mask. The device active area was 0.08 cm2 as defined by the shadow mask.
ESR experiments

Experiment with TEMPOL. 
PTA (6.0 mg) was dissolved in chlorobenzene (1 mL). Aliquots of the obtained solution (0.5 mL) were placed inside two ESR sample tubes. TEMPOL solution in chlorobenzene (2.0 mg in 0.2 mL) was added into one of the tubes. The solvent then was evaporated in a vacuum to form films in the tubes. After measuring the ESR spectra, the films were heated in air at 95 °C for 20 min and subjected to the ESR measurements again.


Experiment with TEMPOBF4. 
PTA (6 mg) was dissolved in chlorobenzene (1 mL). Aliquots of the obtained solution (0.5 mL) were placed inside two ESR sample tubes. TEMPOBF4 solution in chlorobenzene was added (2.8 mg in 0.2 mL) into one of the tubes. The solvent then was evaporated in a vacuum to form films in the tubes, and the ESR spectra were measured. A control TEMPOBF4 (2.8 mg) ESR spectrum was recorded and demonstrated no signal.

UV-vis spectroscopy measurements
PTA (0.20 mg) was dissolved in chlorobenzene (1.0 mL). An aliquot of the solution (75 μL) was diluted with 1.5 mL of chlorobenzene and the UV-vis absorption spectrum was recorded. TEMPOBF4 solution in acetonitrile (0.10 mg mL−1) was prepared, and aliquots of TEMPOBF4 solution (14 μL, 10 molar%) were added. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded for every addition.
Characterization techniques
The current–voltage characteristics of the devices were measured in an inert nitrogen atmosphere inside a glove box using simulated AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by a Newport Verasol AAA class solar simulator. The intensity of the illumination was checked before each measurement using a calibrated silicon diode with a known spectral response. J–V curves were recorded using Advantest 6240A source-measurement units. The EQE spectra were measured using a PV Instruments system integrated with an MBraun glove box.
All UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using an Avantes AvaSpec-2048 optical fiber spectrometer. All ESR spectra were measured using a benchtop ADANI CMS8400 spectrometer.
Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements were implemented in 2-pass amplitude modulation mode in a Cypher ES atomic force microscope installed in an Ar-filled MBraun glove box using conductive Pt coated ElectriMulti 75-G cantilevers.
For the device photostability study, solar cells with an ITO/SnO2/Cs0.12FA0.88PbI2.64Br0.36/PTA/MoO3/Al structure were placed under 30 mW cm−2 illumination (provided by metal halide lamps) at 45 °C under open-circuit conditions in a home-made light soaking chamber filled with nitrogen. The solar cells were periodically taken out from the chamber, tested and immediately placed back for continuous light soaking.
