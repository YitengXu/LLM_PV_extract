    , Accepted 5th August 2019First published on 21st August 2019AbstractHydrogen is a clean energy carrier and fuel cells (FCs) are an efficient conversion technology, and thus have become mainstream research topics that could contribute to sustainable and clean energy supply in modern society. Among the various hydrogen FC types that convert chemical energy into electrical energy via redox reactions, polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) are the most studied technology due to their vast range of applications both mobile and stationary. The use of bio-based materials as substrates for the manufacture of the key constituent components of FCs, to minimize the impact of their production, although in its infancy, is growing exponentially as part of the general concern for sustainability. In fact, natural polymers such as cellulose (i.e. the most abundant biopolymer), and in particular its nanoscale forms, viz. cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), are appropriate materials to engineer the key components of PEFCs, namely the ion-exchange membrane and the catalyst layer (anode and cathode). Despite the intense R&D activity, little has been reviewed about the potential application of these three forms of cellulose with at least one dimension in the nanoscale in the field of FCs. Hence, the overarching goal of this review is to concentrate on the most recent efforts in the domain of bio-based PEFC components, namely the ion-exchange membrane and the electrodes, by targeting the use of nanocellulose as a renewable and easily foldable or stackable nanomaterial. The application of these nanocellulose-based components in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) is also covered.Carla VilelaCarla Vilela has a BSc in Chemical Engineering, MSc in Materials Science and Engineering and PhD in Chemistry (University of Aveiro, UA, Portugal).

Introduction
The exploitation of renewable resources for both energy/fuels and chemicals/materials is growing vigorously as part of the general concern to progressively replace fossil resources with sustainable counterparts.1–8 Although renewability is a concept of extreme importance,9 it is not enough on its own because it does not necessarily correlate with sustainability.10,11 Thus, research initiatives to develop novel materials, processes and technologies that comply with the prerequisites of green chemistry, sustainability and circular economy are being employed everywhere with a sense of rising urgency.12
Hydrogen energy vector and fuel cells (FCs) are not a panacea, but they are among the first-priority energetic/fuel solutions that, in long-term, might contribute to reduce the pressure on the depleting fossil resources and concomitant climate change associated with greenhouse-gas emissions.13,14 Generally speaking, FCs are electrochemical devices that are able to convert chemical energy directly into electrical energy with low-to-zero emissions, high efficiency, reliable and resilient power, fuel flexibility, energy security, scalability and quiet operation.15 Notwithstanding the rising scientific activity in the realm of FCs, their commercialization is not widespread as it would be expected because the financial support is almost entirely driven by government funding and persuading private investors is a very difficult task.16
Among the existing fuel cell types, polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs, also known as proton exchange membrane FCs), are definitely the most studied technology as highlighted by the number of publications on the topic,17–20 and corroborated by the E4tech forecast for 2018.21 The major challenges of PEFCs (and of all the other types of FCs) comprise the diminution of the technical constraints associated with the key components and, at the same time, the use of renewable materials to assemble these efficient conversion systems to minimize the impact of their production. While some of the studies are using nature-inspired methodologies to reduce the technical constraints leveraging the performance of PEFCs,22,23 others are adopting natural polymers to design the key constituent components24,25 and, thus, diminish their production impact and contribute to the sustainable development of society. Examples of such natural polymers include polysaccharides such as chitosan,24,26 alginate,26 carrageenan27 and cellulose.28–37 The latter biopolymer is of great interest for FCs (and low temperature PEFCs in particular) because of its mechanical properties and functionalities, especially when referring to the nanocellulose substrates, viz. cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and bacterial nanocellulose (BNC).38,39 The remarkable features of these nanocellulosic substrates, such as renewable nature, anisotropic shape, tailorable surface chemistry, excellent mechanical properties and biocompatibility,40 dictate their application field (e.g., catalysis,41 printed electronics,42 supercapacitors,43,44 sensing and biosensing,45 photonics, films, nanocomposites and medical devices40). Despite their interesting properties, nanocelluloses do not have some fundamental features such as high ionic conductivity or catalytic activity to act as FC components, namely the ion-exchange membrane or the electrocatalyst layers. Generally, they need to be submitted to physical and chemical modification or combined with ionic conducting phases or metal catalysts to enhance such functionalities. For example, Bayer et al.46 and Gadim et al.32,47 demonstrated the feasibility of using the nanocellulose trio as proton-exchange membranes (PEMs). Notwithstanding the low protonic conductivity in their pristine forms, the combination with polyelectrolytes, like for instance aromatic poly(ether ketone)s (PAEKs),48,49 sulfonated polybenzimidazole (s-PBI)50 and poly(4-styrene sulfonic acid) (PSSA),32 turned these nanocellulose-based materials into good ionic conductors. On the other hand, doping nanocellulose with two or more heteroatoms (e.g., N,S-doped BNC51 and N,P,S-doped CNFs52), prior to conversion into carbon materials via simple carbonization, improved their electrocatalytic activity, and made them suitable as electrocatalysts for anodic and cathodic electrochemical reactions.
Numerous reviews on PEFCs have been published and the most notably one is by Scofield et al.17 focusing on the advances in bettering both cathode catalysts and proton-exchange membranes aiming at sustainable FCs; another one by Kiani et al.20 about the recent developments in electrocatalysts and future prospects for the oxygen reduction reaction in PEFCs; and that by Chen et al.19 dealing with the stack durability test protocols of PEFCs for vehicles. Despite the multiple studies dealing with PEFCs and as far as we could discover, there are no reviews devoted to PEFCs containing nanocellulose-based components. Therefore, the present appraisal intends to fill this void by revising recent aspects of nanocellulose as a substrate for PEFC components, namely the ion-exchange membrane and the electrodes. Additionally, a glimpse over the application of these components in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) is also put forward.
Nanocellulose fundamentals
Cellulose is a linear homopolysaccharide composed of β-D-glucopyranose units linked by β-(1,4) glycosidic bonds. This high molecular weight homopolymer has cellobiose (i.e., a dimer of glucose) as the repeating segment and every glucose unit with a 4C1 chair conformation is corkscrewed 180° with respect to its neighbours.38,53 The degree of polymerization (DP, i.e., number of anhydroglucose units) can reach values up to 20000 depending on the cellulose source and isolation method.38 Furthermore, each individual cellulose chain exhibits two distinct terminal groups, viz. one end is a chemically reducing functionality, namely a hemiacetal unit, and the other is a nominal nonreducing end with a pendant hydroxyl group.38,53 Cellulose is a semi-crystalline biopolymer with a degree of crystallinity in the range of 40–70% because it contains both crystalline (ordered) and amorphous (disordered) regions.54
The large majority of cellulose accessible on Earth is produced by photosynthesis in green plants, where it represents the key structural component of plant cell walls in tandem with hemicelluloses, lignin and pectins.55 Nonetheless, this ubiquitous and biodegradable biopolymer is also produced by a family of sea animals called tunicates, numerous species of algae and some aerobic non-pathogenic bacteria.56 The most relevant properties of this inexpensive polysaccharide (wood pulp monthly price (February 2019, Index Mundi57): ca. €770 per tonnes or €0.77 per kilogram) include an anisotropic shape, good mechanical performance, biocompatibility and customizable surface chemistry, which translates into a raw material that can be applied in almost all domains of modern science and technology.38,40–44,55,58–60
The discovery of the nanoscale forms of this natural polymer, viz. CNCs, CNFs and BNC (Fig. 1), unveiled novel avenues to develop sustainable multifunctional cellulose nanomaterials for a myriad of applications.38,44,56,59,61 These forms of cellulose, with at least one dimension in the nanoscale, are produced using different methodologies, yielding substrates with different dimensions and properties. All three nanocellulose types are commercialized with the global nanocellulose market rated at ca. US$54 million in 2014. The market is projected to reach a value of almost US$700 million by the end of 2023 at a notable CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 33.8% from 2015 to 2023.62 Regarding nanocellulose manufacturers, the major players include CelluForce in Canada, American Process in USA, RISE in Sweden, Stora Enso in Finland, Daicel FineChem and Nippon Paper in Japan, and Melodea in Israel.

The principal nanocellulose developers are using it for application in composites, paper and board, packaging, aerospace and aviation, automotive, construction and building, textiles and clothing, medical and healthcare, coatings and paints, aerogels, oil and gas exploration, filtration and separation, rheology modifiers, printable, stretchable and flexible electronics, and 3D-printing.63 The prospects for nanocellulose were recently updated in two TAPPI books, namely “Nanocellulose producers, products, and applications: a guide for end users” and “Nanocellulose challenges and opportunities: end user perspectives” authored by Miller,64,65 and also in market reports published for instance by Future Markets about “The global market for nanocellulose 2018–2027”66 and “The nanocellulose investment and pricing guide 2018”.63
CNCs, also known as cellulose nanowhiskers, can be extracted from plant cellulose fibres by acid hydrolysis, typically with sulphuric acid (or less commonly by oxidation), which hydrolyses the amorphous domains of the fibres leaving behind the crystalline ones. Typical sources of CNCs include lignocellulosic biomass, namely woody and non-woody plants (e.g., soft and hardwood, hemp, flax, wheat straw, etc.), and animal, algae and bacterial sources.67 In terms of production, the Canadian CelluForce is the biggest manufacturer of CNCs via sulfuric acid hydrolysis with a capacity of 300 tonnes per year (dry basis).64 According to Klemm et al.,38 the cost of CNCs as R&D samples is approximately €800 per kilogram, although it is foreseen that sale prices might be cheaper than €15 per kilogram for sulfuric acid hydrolysed CNCs.
Highly crystalline (85–95%) CNCs exhibit a rigid rod-like or needle-like shape morphology with a cross-sectional size of 5–70 nm, and length in the range of 100–250 nm for plant cellulose and 100 nm to several micrometres for cellulose obtained from tunicates, algae and bacteria (Fig. 1).38,53 Sulfuric acid hydrolysed CNCs comprise both hydroxyl and sulphate groups, and thus exhibit a surface charge density of 80–350 mmol kg−1,68 and a lower thermal stability than the other nanoscale forms of cellulose.69,70 Furthermore, this nanomaterial presents a surface area of 250–500 m2 g−1, elastic modulus (in the axial direction) of 110–120 GPa, density of 1.6 g cm−3,67,71 and H2 permeability of 0.01 barrer (ca. 3.35 × 10−18 mol m s−1 m−2 Pa−1).46 CNCs are mainly applied as interface stabilizers, rheological modifiers, films/coatings and reinforcing agents in polymer composites, as well as in biomedical devices due to their non-toxic nature.38
CNFs, also called nano- or microfibrillated cellulose, are fabricated by delamination of wood pulp by mechanical pressure before and/or after chemical or enzymatic treatment. Other common sources of CNFs comprise sugar beet, potato tuber, hemp and flax.59 Nippon Paper from Japan is the main producer of CNFs with a capacity of 560 tonnes per year on a dry basis.64 The costs associated with the production of CNFs depend on whether the process is integrated or non-integrated in a pulp mill, but are much lower than those of CNCs. In fact, the costs can reach a value of €2.5 per kilogram for the non-integrated use of CNFs as a wet-end additive in papermaking applications or even €0.4 per kilogram if the CNF production (enzymatic pre-treatment process) from pulp is integrated in a pulp mill.38
CNFs isolated by 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-mediated oxidation and mechanical treatment present carboxylic acid surface groups, which translates into a surface charge density of 200–1800 mmol kg−1.68 CNFs consist of long, flexible and entangled fibrils with a cross-sectional size of 5–60 nm and length of 0.1–2 μm (Fig. 1). CNFs are less crystalline than CNCs with a degree of crystallinity of about 73–80%,72 but more thermally stable than CNCs due to the absence of sulphate groups. The DP of CNFs is higher than 500, the H2 permeability is around 0.02 barrer (ca. 6.7 × 10−18 mol m s−1 m−2 Pa−1),46 and the Young's modulus varies between 145 and 150 GPa,73 making them particularly suitable as reinforcing agents in composite materials,74,75 and also as papermaking strength additives.38
Several early reviews have highlighted the potential of both CNCs and CNFs for application in high-performance energy devices due to the excellent physical, mechanical and optical properties of these nanomaterials.43,44,76,77 For example, Du et al.76 reviewed the state-of-the-art of nanocellulose-based conductive materials and their emerging applications in energy devices, such as flexible supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries and solar cells. The focus was placed on the combination of nanocellulose with conductive materials including conductive polymers, conductive carbon and metallic particles since neither CNCs nor CNFs are electrically conductive. Pérez-Madrigal et al.43 provided a wide-ranging insight into the use of (nano)cellulose-based materials for supercapacitors. The authors divided the critical review according to the roles played by (nano)cellulose, namely as a support for mechanical reinforcement, a mechanically inert template or renewable carbon source, a separator membrane between supercapacitor electrodes, and as an electrode. Chen et al.44 discussed in a comprehensive review the potential of CNCs and CNFs as nanomaterials for advanced electrochemical energy storage, namely supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), lithium–sulphur (Li–S) batteries, and sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). Additional reading about the structure, production, characterization, properties and applications of both CNCs and CNFs is accessible in the appropriate literature.38,67,68,71,77–80
BNC, also known as microbial cellulose or biocellulose, is an exopolysaccharide produced biotechnologically by bacteria from low-molecular weight carbon sources such as glucose. BNC is a high purity cellulose substrate with a web-like entangled morphology that is secreted extracellularly by bacteria like for example the acetic acid bacteria of the genus Komagataeibacter (formerly classified as Gluconacetobacter).81,82 This high aspect-ratio nanocellulose is mainly produced under static conditions in the form of a thick gel formed by an interconnected three-dimensional porous nanofiber network structure that contains ca. 99% water. The BNC market was valued at about US$200 million in 2017 and is forecasted to reach US$280 million by 2025.83 Still, the BNC-based products are restricted to high-value niche markets due to the high BNC price, whose production costs can vary from ca. €60 to ca. €9000 per kilogram depending on the culture media.84 Examples of commercial BNC-based products include the following FDA approved and/or CE-certified products: the implant SYNTHECEL® Dura Repair manufactured by DePuy Synthes (USA), and the wound dressings epicitehydro and Celmat fabricated by JeNaCell GmbH (Germany) and BOWIL (Poland), respectively.38
In terms of dimensions (Fig. 1), BNC is composed of nanofibrils with a cross-sectional size of 20–100 nm.38 BNC exhibits a crystallinity of up to 90%,44 DP in the range of 4000–10000,38 tensile strength of 200–300 MPa, Young's modulus up to 15–35 GPa,81 and H2 permeability of about 1.30 × 10−7 mol mil h−1 cm−2 atm−1.31 The most prevalent characteristic of BNC is related to its moldability and shape retention, together with the recently attained degree of control over the three-dimensional morphology of BNC films across several length scales.85 Additionally, BNC has the ability to house different types of molecules and macromolecules within its three-dimensional structure, which enables the design of materials with an engineerable size, form and functionalities for myriad applications, particularly for drug delivery86,87 and other biomedical applications (e.g., scaffolds for cell cultivation and medical implants),38,78,88 and also for electrochemical devices such as supercapacitors43 and fuel cells.25,32,36,37,47,89 Supplementary details concerning the BNC structure, properties and applications are available in numerous appraisals38,78,80,81,90–96 and books.97,98
In this sense, nanocelluloses might become cost-effective and sustainable alternatives to develop components for low-cost PEFCs since these nanomaterials present the essential features and performance, including low H2 permeability, good mechanical properties and wet-dimensional stability, and being easily foldable and stackable, which are fundamental for application in the domain of FCs, as will become evident in this appraisal. All these properties can be tailored by controlling the dimensions, surface and internal structures of nanocellulose-based materials, as recently discussed by Zhang et al.99 in the review about nanofibers as a platform for high-functional ion exchangers.
Overview of fuel cells
FCs are electrochemical devices that convert chemical energy into electrical energy (plus water and heat) via redox reactions, i.e., an oxidation process of a fuel (e.g., hydrogen and methanol) at the anode and the corresponding reduction of oxygen gas at the cathode.17 The FC technology presents low-to-zero emissions at the point-of-use, high efficiency over the load range, fuel flexibility, modular design and quiet operation.15 Moreover, FCs are not limited by the Carnot cycle and thus have an electric efficiency of 30–63% and an overall CHP (combined heat and power) efficiency of 55–88%, which are comparable with the efficiencies obtained for reciprocating engines with values of 27–41% and 77–80%, respectively.100 Nevertheless, the major weaknesses of FCs include the high cost of the electrocatalyst, durability and performance limitations, together with the lack of fuel storage and transportation infrastructures.16,101,102
The existence of different types of hydrogen FCs with distinct electrolyte materials, namely alkaline fuel cells (AFCs), phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFCs), molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs), solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), and polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs),101,103,104 allow their application in different areas, from the medical field105 to residential, commercial and industrial sectors.101 These fuel cell types, in addition to different electrolytes, also run at different operating temperatures and with distinct charge carriers. While AFCs and PEFCs are considered low temperature FCs with operating temperatures that do not exceed 120 °C, the three other types, viz. PAFCs, MCFCs and SOFCs, are high temperature FCs that operate between 200 and 1000 °C. Furthermore, PAFCs and PEFCs have electrolytes that conduct protons (H+), whereas AFCs, MCFCs and SOFCs use electrolytes that conduct OH−, CO32− and O2− ions, respectively. Worth noting is the fact that the charge carriers move through the electrolyte into the oppositely charged electrode with the ion migration mainly driven by concentration gradient.104
In addition to these five FCs, there are also non-hydrogen FCs, namely direct FCs that use liquid fuels (e.g. methanol, ethanol, glycerol and hydrazine) such as direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) which are a subcategory of PEFCs,106 and biological fuel cells that are fuelled by organic fluids, including enzymatic FCs that use e.g. physiological fluids as fuel,107 and microbial fuel cells (MFCs) that utilize organic matter (e.g. wastewater) to fuel the microorganisms.108
The typical FC performance parameters vary depending on the type of FC (i.e., AFCs, PAFCs, MCFCs, SOFCs and PEFCs) and its capacity. Notwithstanding the differences between the previously mentioned FC types, in terms of the electrolyte, operating temperature and fuel, all encompass three key components, namely the membrane, the catalyst layer (CL, anode and cathode), and gas diffusion layers (GDLs) (Fig. 2), which form the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), not thicker than a few hundred microns.109 Given that a single unit cell only has a small potential between 0.5 and 0.8 V,101 the cells are combined to produce stacks in order to reach the required voltage, and each cell is separated with bipolar plates providing a fuel distribution channel and a method for the extraction of electric current.102 The complexity level of the FC stack is substantial when compared to a single unit cell because of the requirements for current collection, thermal management, water management, humidification of gases, cell and gas separation, structural support, and oxidant and fuel distribution.101 Comprehensive discussions regarding the components of FCs are accessible in the literature.110–112
 Fig. 2  Representation of a dual-layer GDL for a PEFC system.113–115 
The FCs whose operation is based on the PEFC technology are the most studied systems with applications in backup and portable power, distributed generation, transportation and specialty vehicles. Despite the use of expensive catalysts and membranes, and the sensitivity to fuel impurities (CO and H2S), PEFCs present the advantages of low temperature (<120 °C), quick start-up time and load-following, as well as reduced corrosion and electrolyte management problems due to the utilization of a solid electrolyte. From the angle of this review, the following paragraphs encompass a short excursion into the ion-exchange membranes and electrodes of PEFCs.
Ion-exchange membranes
Ion-exchange membranes, viz. membranes with the ability to conduct ions, can be categorized into two types when applied in PEFCs, namely proton-exchange membranes (PEMs) and anion-exchange membranes (AEMs). Both are currently used as a sandwiched membrane between the electrodes of FC devices. As mentioned above, the former selectively conduct protons from the anode to the cathode, whereas the latter selectively mediate the migration of hydroxide ions from the cathode to the anode.116 Thus, the electrode and overall reactions of the FC systems using PEMs and AEMs are different, as summarized in Table 1, as well as the pH cell environment, i.e. acidic for PEMS and alkaline for AEMs. The most relevant properties of ion-exchange membranes include the thickness, density, tensile strength, equivalent weight, ion-exchange capacity (IEC), water-uptake, hydration number, water sorption isotherm, diffusion permeability, electroosmotic permeability and ionic conductivity, as examined elsewhere.117

In addition to conducting ions, these membranes prevent electrical shortage and fuel crossover, and must satisfy strict requirements to be applied as separators in FCs, viz. adequate mechanical performance, gas tightness, dimensional and chemical stability under oxidative environments, and variable temperature and humidity conditions.101,116 Furthermore, the membranes rely on the presence of liquid water to effectively conduct ions via the vehicle and Grotthuss type mechanisms. In the vehicle mechanism, which is convenient for every type of ion, the transport occurs by ion diffusion with water where the ions are transported by a vehicle such as hydronium (H3O+).119 In the Grotthuss mechanism, which is possible only for protons (H+) or hydroxide ions (OH−, considered as a proton hole), the ion transport involves the hopping or tunnelling of ions between water molecules through the exchange of a covalent bond between H and O atoms with the hydrogen bond formed by the same H with an adjacent H2O molecule.120
The ionic conductivity, viz. the electrical conductivity due to the motion of ionic charges, is an important parameter and is dependent on the concentration of the ion-conducting species, charge carrier (cationic or anionic), relative humidity and temperature. The temperature dependence of the conductivity usually shows an Arrhenius-type behaviour: , but sometimes is better fitted by a Vogel–Tammann–Fulcher (VTF)-type equation: , where σ0 is a pre-exponential term, Ea is the activation energy for ion transport, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, A is a pre-exponential term related to the charge carrier density that depends on temperature according to , B is an activation energy term related to the migration of the smallest segmented polymer chain, and T0 is an equilibrium temperature (also known as the Vogel temperature), below which the migration vanishes and only vibrations occur.32,121
In terms of advantages, PEMs present higher performance and voltage efficiencies, good partial load, rapid system response and dynamic operation, whereas AEMs use non-noble metal catalysts and non-corrosive electrolytes and have a lower cost, absence of leaking and high operating pressure.122 Concerning the disadvantages, PEMs have a high cost of the components, acidic corrosive components, possibly low durability, use of noble metal catalysts and stack below the megawatt range,122 while AEMs are yet in the laboratory stage and exhibit low current densities, durability issues, membrane degradation and excessive catalyst loading.123,124
PEMs are the key component of PEFCs and have been deserving most of the R&D efforts due to the unsatisfactory performance of the state-of-the-art perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membrane materials, such as Nafion™ from DuPont®, Aquivion® from Solvay, Aciplex from Asahi Chemicals Co., Flemion from Asahi Glass Co., Gore-Select from Gore and Associate, Fumapem from Fumatech, and Dais membranes from Dais Analytical Co.125 Several appraisals have been written on the topic of PEMs reporting remarkable details about their production, structure and properties,17,103,116,126,127 as well as the constituent materials including membranes based on room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs),128 water soluble polymers,129 radiation-grafted polymers,125,130 and electrospun non-woven nanofibers131 and on the use of plasticizers.132
Nafion™ is the benchmark PEM to which all novel materials are compared. This ionomer prepared by the copolymerization of variable amounts of unsaturated perfluoroalkyl sulfonyl fluoride with tetrafluoroethylene exhibits a molecular weight of 93–100 kg mol−1, a glass transition temperature (Tg) of around 339 K, a density of 2.074 g cm−3 (at 300 K) and a dielectric constant of 3.04,133 as well as an equivalent weight of 1100 g mol−1 per –SO3H group, thickness in the range of 50–175 μm, a water-uptake capacity of 21 wt% and a conductivity of 80–1100 mS cm−1.125 Moreover, Nafion™ presents a tensile strength and modulus of 25 and 64 MPa, respectively, and an elongation at break of 180% when water soaked at 100 °C.134 The drawbacks of this ionomer were examined in the review by Kraytsberg and Ein-Eli,103 but the main pitfalls encompass the high production cost (ca. US$2300 per m2),135 the low conductivity at low humidity and/or high temperature (>100 °C) and the loss of mechanical performance at high temperature.133
The costs associated with PEMs can be reduced by replacing Nafion™ with cheaper alternatives that still provide the necessary ionic conductivity, thermal, mechanical and chemical stability, gas-blocking properties and acceptable durability. In terms of technical targets, DOE has established for 2020 targets that a PEM operating at temperatures lower than 120 °C should have a maximum oxygen and hydrogen cross-over of 2 mA cm−2, area-specific proton resistance of 0.02 Ω cm2 (maximum operating temperature and water partial pressures from 40–80 kPa), minimum electrical resistance of 1000 Ω cm,2 combined chemical/mechanical durability of 20000 cycles until H2 crossover >15 mA cm−2 or open-circuit voltage (OCV) loss >20%, and a cost of US$20 per m2.136 More instructive literature reviews about Nafion™ can be found elsewhere.133,137–139
Similarly to PEMs, the design of AEMs is also being investigated,118,140–144 although to a smaller extent. Commercial AEMs such as Neosepta® (Tokuyama Co Ltd., Japan), Ralex® AM (MEGA a.s., Czech Republic), Fumasep® FAB and Fumasep® FAD (FuMA-Tech GmbH, Germany), Chemjoy® CJMAED (Chemjoy Co., Ltd., China), and JAM-II (Tingrun Co., Ltd., China)116,123 are already being tested in FC systems.
Research on eco-friendly (and cost-effective126) alternatives to Nafion™ and other commercial membranes is still in its initial stages, due to the difficulty in finding a material capable of satisfying the harsh requirements for application as separators in FCs. For example, chitosan-based PEMs are one of the most studied membrane systems;24,103 however, the very low conductivity103 and the high solubility of chitosan in diluted acidic aqueous solutions are major setbacks that need to be surpassed for their effective application. In contrast, nanocellulose-based PEMs and AEMs are not affect by these issues, as will be discussed later.
Electrodes
The anode and cathode electrodes are also key components of PEFCs since it is where the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) take place, respectively.17 In general, the anodic and cathodic electrodes are composed of a GDL and CL, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The GDL, whose role is to act as a gas spreader, current collector and water guide,145 is typically a dual-layer carbon-based porous substrate, viz. macroporous and microporous layers. The first layer is generally a carbon-fibre cloth or carbon paper that works as a current collector and electrode physical support, whereas a thinner microporous layer is generally composed of carbon black powder and a hydrophobic agent.113 The CL is where the electrochemical reactions occur by converting the hydrogen gas feed and oxygen to water and electricity.145 Typically, the CL has a thickness between 5 and 100 μm, and consists of a catalyst, a carbon substrate, a hydrophobic substance, and an ionomer such as Nafion™. The catalyst is responsible for accelerating the HOR and ORR, while the ionomer grants access for protons to move from the anode to the cathode.145 Additional details about electrodes can be retrieved in the appraisals by Majlan et al.145 who thoroughly discussed the components, preparation, functions and performance of the electrodes used in PEFCs, and by Park et al.115 who reviewed the materials and designs of the GDL in PEFCs.
While the HOR at the anode is intrinsically fast, the cathodic ORR on the catalyst surface is kinetically sluggish, mainly because of the differences in the bond dissociation energies between the O–O bond (ΔHf298 = 498 kJ mol−1) and the H–H bond (ΔHf298 = 436 kJ mol−1).146 Hence, the ORR requires the use of noble-metal-based catalysts given their high intrinsic catalytic activity.147,148
Platinum and its alloys supported on a high surface area carbon support are the most commonly employed catalysts (in acidic media) in PEFCs and are, to a large extent, the culprit for the high cost of this type of FC.149 In fact, Pt is not an abundant earth metal and according to Johnson Matthey Precious Metals Management (JM PMM, the world's leading authority on platinum group metals) the price of this transition metal reached a value of about US$815 per troy oz in June 2019. Although the HOR requires a low Pt loading (ca. 0.05 mg cm−2), the impurity sensitive ORR requires a high loading of Pt of about 0.5 mg per cm2 electrode area.149 Thus, Pt electrocatalysts, which are susceptible to the crossover effect, should be reduced by using Pt-metal alloys and Pt-based core–shell and hierarchical structures, or even replaced by palladium-based nanostructures, precious metal-free catalysts such as cobalt- and iron-based porphyrins and phthalocyanines, and metal-free catalysts.17 Nevertheless, these kinds of systems are still in their early stages of development. The DOE 2020 technical targets for electrocatalysts establish a platinum group metal (PGM) total loading for both electrodes of 0.125 mg per cm2 electrode area and a PGM-free catalyst activity higher than 0.044 A cm−2 at 0.9 VIR-free (equivalent to a PGM catalyst mass activity target of 0.44 A per mg of PGM at 0.1 mg of PGM per cm2).136
Further insights into the domain of electrocatalysts are provided in previous review papers such as those published by Sapountzi et al.147 which discusses about electrocatalysts for the generation of hydrogen, oxygen and synthesis gas; Zhang et al.150 that gives an overview of metal oxide materials as electrocatalysts and supports for PEFCs; Kiani et al.20 that highlights the recent developments in electrocatalysts and discusses the future prospects for the ORR in PEFCs; Zhang et al.148 that focusses on the synthetic strategies (from nanostructures to single atoms) to prepare Pt-based catalysts with high atom utilization efficiency as a way to design highly active Pt catalysts with reduced cost for electrochemical reactions.
Current studies are also reporting the use of advanced biomass-derived electrocatalysts for the ORR as compiled in recent reviews.151–154 Among the portfolio of biomass resources, cellulose28,29 and its nanometric forms also have potential as high surface area carbon materials for the preparation of electrocatalysts, as will be examined later.
Nanocellulose-based ion-exchange membranes
As mentioned above, ion-exchange membranes are polyelectrolytic separators that are permeable to ions, namely protons or hydroxide ions, but impermeable to electrons, fuel and oxidizing gases. The replacement of these membranes, usually made of non-eco-friendly and expensive Nafion™, by environmentally friendly alternatives based on nanocellulose is flourishing since the nanoscale forms of cellulose dispel the pitfalls associated with other natural polymers such as chitosan.24,103 In fact, the three nanocellulose forms are being physically and chemically modified or combined with ionic conducting phases to exhibit high ionic conductivity, which is one of the fundamental characteristics to act as conductive separators in FCs. The number of examples dealing with CNCs,48,49,155–160 CNFs50,161–163 and BNC33,34,36,164–169 for application as PEMs is substantial and the reported results are quite promising. Regarding the use of the nanocellulose triad for the manufacture of AEMs, the number of studies is reduced but the existing examples with CNC,170,171 CNF172,173 and BNC89,174 based nanomaterials also show some potential features.
The following sections will highlight the studies that have been carried out in the last couple of years, and the respective downsides encountered in the attempt to engineer PEMs composed solely of pure nanocellulose and PEMs and AEMs derived from nanocellulose in combination with other materials. Table 2 summarizes the most relevant contributions about nanocellulose-based ion-exchange membranes.

Pure nanocellulose proton-exchange membranes
Bayer et al.46 and Gadim et al.32,47 have validated the potential use of each of the pristine nanocellulose trio as a PEM. The first research team reported that: (i) a CNC membrane with 30 μm thickness (Fig. 3A), 65% crystallinity and 0.018 cm3 g−1 total mesoporous volume presents a H2 permeability of 0.01 barrer, and maximum proton conductivity and power density of 4.6 mS cm−1 (at 120 °C, 100% RH) and 17.2 mW cm−2 (at 80 °C, 95% RH), respectively; and (ii) a CNF membrane with 32 μm of thickness (Fig. 3B), 51% crystallinity and 0.016 cm3 g−1 total mesoporous volume exhibits a H2 permeability of 0.02 barrer and maximum proton conductivity and power density of 0.05 mS cm−1 (at 100 °C, 100% RH) and 0.79 mW cm−2 (at 80 °C, 95% RH), respectively.46 These results clearly show the high H2 barrier properties of both CNCs and CNFs, whose values were three orders of magnitude lower than those of Nafion™. In contrast, the story of the protonic conductivity and fuel cell performance for both CNC and CNF membranes is entirely different from that of Nafion™. Fig. 3C shows the gap between the protonic conductivity of CNFs and CNCs in comparison with that of Nafion™ (ca. 0.1 S cm−1 at 100–120 °C, 100% RH). Regarding the fuel cell performance (electrodes: ca. 0.3 mg cm−2 Pt loading), the same behaviour is evident with CNFs and CNCs reaching maximum power densities of 0.79 and 17.2 mW cm−1 (at 80 °C and 95% RH), respectively, which are much lower performances than that obtained for Nafion™ (ca. 450 mW cm−1).46Fig. 3D exemplifies the proton conduction mechanisms in papers made of nanocellulose (CNCs and CNFs), which is dominated by a Grotthuss-like water-mediated mechanism. It should also be mentioned that the sulfonic acid groups present in the CNCs are responsible for their higher ionic conductivity, as indeed reported by Tritt-Goc et al.175 who used CNCs free of acidic groups and obtained a much lower conductivity value of 0.01 mS cm−1 above 200 °C.

Gadim et al.32 demonstrated that BNC (after treatment with 0.5 M aqueous HCl for 24 hours at room temperature) is a poor ionic conductor, just like the other two nanoscale partners, with a value of about 0.06 mS cm−1 at 94 °C and 98% RH. This conductivity value is similar to that obtained for CNFs but much lower than that of the CNC paper membrane that contains sulfonic acid groups introduced during acid hydrolysis.46 A few years earlier, Gelin et al.176 reported a conductivity value of around 0.1 mS cm−1 (at room temperature) for highly hydrated BNC gels by dielectric spectroscopy, but the aim of the study was to investigate the water interaction and transport properties of BNC gels. Furthermore, Gadim et al.47 also assessed the fuel cell performance (electrodes: ca. 1 mg cm−2 Pt loading) with a BNC membrane, which showed a maximum power density of around 0.06 mW cm−2 at 25 °C and 50% RH. This value is one order of magnitude inferior to that of the CNF membrane and three orders of magnitude lower than that of the CNC membrane. Although both authors measured the protonic conductivity across the membranes thickness direction, i.e. in the through-plane (TP) configuration, the differences might be explained, in part, by the lower thickness of both CNC and CNF membranes (30 and 32 μm, respectively) when compared with the BNC membrane (120 μm), which makes BNC four times more resistive, as well as by the different operating conditions used in the distinct fuel cell test systems.32,46,47 Actually, Bayer et al.46 operated the respective cell at 80 °C at which the membrane conductivity is four to five times higher than that at room temperature.
Despite the low protonic conductivity of the nanoscale forms of cellulose (σmax: 4.6 mS cm−1 for CNCs, 0.05 mS cm−1 for CNFs and 0.06 mS cm−1 for BNC, Table 2),32,46,47 these nanomaterials can act as substrates for FC components after chemical or physical modification or combination with e.g. ionic conducting phases, to turn them into good ionic conductors.
CNCs-based materials for proton-exchange membranes
CNCs are being studied as components of PEMs mainly because of their reinforcing ability and also due to the presence of sulfonic acid groups incorporated during their production by hydrolysis with sulphuric acid. Since the films or membranes formed by CNCs disintegrate upon exposure to water, CNCs-based PEMs can be prepared for instance by doping these nanomaterials with e.g. imidazole175 or by combining them with polymeric matrices (e.g., poly(vinyl alcohol) and chitosan177), which contributes to the development of dimensionally stable materials. CNCs, apart from being used in their pristine form, can additionally be applied after chemical modification to introduce other functional groups (e.g. amino moieties157) besides hydroxyl and sulfonic acid groups. The combination between aromatic poly(ether ketone)s (PAEKs)17,103,126 and CNCs is attracting significant attention, as shown in Table 2. These PAEKs can be sulfonated such as the sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone)s (SPAEK),48,49 sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK),155 and sulfophenylated poly(ether ether ketone ketone) (Ph-SPEEKK),156,157 and also fluorinated such as the sulfonated fluorenyl-containing poly(aryl ether ketones) (SFPAEKs)158 and sulfonated fluorenyl-containing poly(ether ether ketone ketone)s (SFPEEKKs).159,160
A representative example of the ongoing research in this domain includes the work of Hou et al.48 about membranes of SPAEK containing sulfonic and carboxylic groups and reinforced with CNCs (2, 5, 8 and 10 wt%). The membrane composed of SPAEK with 10% carboxylic groups and 5 wt% CNCs presents a Young's modulus value (ca. 526 MPa, wet) that is 1.5 times higher than the pure SPAEK matrix (ca. 350 MPa). Moreover, this membrane with a water-uptake ability of ca. 77% (at 80 °C) and an IEC of 2.49 mequiv. g−1 exhibits a protonic conductivity of 272 mS cm−1 at 80 °C (when fully hydrated, in-plane (IP) configuration), which is 1.7 times higher than that of the pure SPAEK matrix (163 mS cm−1). In a subsequent study, Ni et al.49 investigated the effect of cross-linking on similar SPAEK derived membranes containing sulfonic and carboxylic acid groups and reinforced with CNCs (2, 5, 8 and 10 wt%). In general, the cross-linking of the membranes increased their mechanical performance but decreased their water-uptake, IEC and conductivity. The highest conductivity (218 mS cm−1 at 90 °C and fully hydrated, IP configuration) was obtained for the non-cross-linked membrane composed of SPAEK with 10% carboxylic acid groups and 5 wt% CNCs.49
Equally interesting is the study of Zhao et al.157 about covalent-ionically cross-linked membranes of Ph-SPEEKK and aminated-CNCs (2, 5 and 8 wt%) prepared by a solution casting method as portrayed in Fig. 4A. The presence of CNCs bearing both amino and sulfonic acid groups improved the dimensional stability, water-uptake capacity, proton conductivity, mechanical properties and fuel cell performance of the Ph-SPEEKK matrix. In fact, the membrane composed of 5 wt% aminated-CNCs (water-uptake of 111% at 100 °C and IEC of 1.895 mmol g−1) showed a Young's modulus of 1.18 GPa (wet) which is 1.3 times higher than that of the pure Ph-SPEEKK membrane (907 MPa), promoted by the covalent-ionic cross-linking between the modified CNCs with –NH2 and the silicon–oxygen network and the Ph-SPEEKK matrix. The fully hydrated membrane exhibited a maximum conductivity of 210 mS cm−1 at 100 °C (IP configuration) and reached a maximum power density of 227 mW cm−2 at 75 °C and 100% RH, when using a Pt loading of 0.4 mg cm−2 for both the cathode and anode. The temperature dependence of the conductivity is visible on the cell performance where the power density increases with temperature as verified in Fig. 4B.

Table 2 evidences that most studies about CNCs-based PEMs assessed the protonic conductivity along the membrane surface direction, i.e. in the in-plane configuration (Fig. 5D), and also that the combination of CNCs and PAEKs produces PEMs with mechanical performance, IEC and ionic conductivity comparable or superior to those of the state-of-the-art Nafion™. Despite these promising properties where a maximum protonic conductivity of 272 mS cm−1 (at 80 °C, fully hydrated, IP) was achieved,48 most studies (just like the vast majority of publications on other PEMs) did not perform any fuel cell tests to assess the cell performance, and thus failed to corroborate the real potential of these CNCs-based PEMs for FCs application.

CNFs-based materials for proton-exchange membranes
CNFs are also being used in the fabrication of PEMs although to a lesser degree when compared to CNCs (and also to BNC as will be avowed in the following section). This nanometric form of cellulose is mainly applied as a reinforcing element of synthetic polymeric matrices, such as sulfonated poly(ether sulfone) (SPES),161,162 poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)163 and sulfonated polybenzimidazole (s-PBI).50 Most of these PEMs are prepared by blending followed by casting or filtration.
Xu et al.161 prepared membranes of SPES and CNFs (5 wt%) with a tensile strength of 40 MPa, water-uptake capacity of ca. 40% at 80 °C, and proton conductivity of 130 mS cm−1 at 80 °C and 100% RH (with the IP configuration). The hydrophilicity of the PEMs increased with the increasing content of CNFs from 1 to 5 wt%. Surprisingly, the CNFs used in this study were produced from cellulose acetate via electrostatic-induction-assisted solution blow spinning, which might explain the small increase of the tensile strength of the membranes with the increasing content of CNFs.
As an extension of this investigation, Cai et al.162 embedded phosphoric acid-doped (0.25 mol dm−3) CNFs into a sulfonated-SPES matrix (95 wt%). The membranes with a thickness of about 85–120 μm present a tensile strength of 28 MPa, water-uptake capacity of 43% (at 80 °C), IEC of 1.52 mmol g−1 and proton conductivity of 154 mS cm−1 at 80 °C and 100% RH (with the IP configuration). The use of CNFs doped with phosphoric acid as an alternative to pure CNFs decreased the mechanical properties of the membranes but increased the conductivity. Nevertheless, both studies were ineffective in validating the potential of the developed PEMs because no fuel cell tests were carried out.161,162
Similarly motivating are the results obtained by Li et al.163 for gel electrolyte membranes composed of cross-linked PAA and CNFs. Although these membranes were not developed for fuel cell applications (but instead for Al–air batteries) and thus no fuel cell tests were performed, the ionic conductivity values are quite promising. The gel membrane containing 3 wt% CNFs can reach a maximum swelling ratio of 200%, tensile stress of 1.85 MPa and conductivity of 270 mS cm−1 at room temperature (with the IP configuration). Worth mentioning is the fact that this conductivity value is the highest among the numerous studies about nanocellulose-based PEMs at room temperature (Table 2).
The majority of the studies dealing with CNF-based PEMS, much like in the case of CNCs-based PEMS, only measure the protonic conductivity in the IP configuration, viz. along the membrane surface direction (Fig. 5D), and do not perform tests in lab-scale fuels cells. This is a clear indication that the overall performance of FCs operating with CNFs-based PEMs is behind the vastly studied Nafion™ membranes, despite their promising mechanical performance, IEC and ionic conductivity (σmax: 270 mS cm−1 at RT,163Table 2) when compared to that benchmark PEM.
BNC-based materials for proton-exchange membranes
Most of the studies dealing with nanocellulose-based PEMs are focused on the use of BNC (Table 2) mainly because this nanoscale form of cellulose, contrary to the other two, does not disintegrate upon exposure to water. Actually, BNC can be produced directly in the form of membranes with a customizable size and shape. This feature is certainly an advantage since it obviates the need for binders or other types of compounds that contribute to the formation of stable films or membranes. Our research group benefited from this asset to design several BNC-based PEMs25,32,36,37,47 as well as an AEM.89
One of the first studies about BNC as a protonic conductor was reported by Evans et al.31 who sandwiched a KCl-saturated BNC membrane between two palladium–BNC membranes as an anode and cathode. The authors demonstrated the potential of the palladium–BNC nanomaterial by the anodic oxidation of H2via an acid displacement reaction and the associated electric current generation. However, the fuel cell current output was very low, 84.3 μW cm−2 (0.2 mA/0.48 V at room temperature), as a result of the inherent low conductivity of the electrolyte, i.e. the pure BNC membrane treated with KCl. As an extension of the previous idea, Yang et al.35 produced platinum–BNC catalyst layers assembled with a BNC electrolyte modified with H3PW12O40·29H2O. The power output of this fuel cell in an anhydrous H2/O2 gradient was less than 20 mW cm−2 (at 40 °C), probably because of the large ohmic drop in the electrolyte. Despite the fuel cell tests, this study does not provide any information on the protonic conductivity neither on the thermal and chemical stability of the nanomaterials.
The assembly of BNC-based membrane separators can be achieved via different strategies, namely: (i) the in situ polymerization of electrolyte monomers within the pure BNC three-dimensional network,25,32,37,89 (ii) the blending of BNC dispersed nanofibers with a polyelectrolyte or ionomer followed by casting,164 (iii) the diffusion of an ion conductor onto the BNC membrane network,33,36,165,166 (iv) the chemical modification of the BNC template with, for instance, protogenic groups,167–169 and finally, (v) the modification of BNC via grafting polymerization with an electrolyte.34
The in situ polymerization of electrolyte monomers within the pure BNC three-dimensional network is a simple and one-pot strategy to assemble BNC-based separators, because the BNC porous structure can house all kinds of functional molecules and macromolecules. Among the catalogue of monomers, 4-styrenesulfonic acid,32 methacryloyloxyethyl phosphate,37 and bis[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]phosphate25 have already been polymerized inside the wet BNC membranes for the production of PEMs.
Gadim et al.32 fabricated BNC-based nanocomposite membranes containing poly(4-styrene sulfonic acid) (PSSA) (Fig. 5A), which is a low-cost polyelectrolyte with high protonic conductivity, and perceived as a green alternative to Nafion™. The authors were able to develop membranes with higher storage modulus and protonic conductivity than those of commercial Nafion™. The large concentration of sulfonic acid groups (2.36 mmol g−1) is responsible for the IEC of 2.25 mmol g−1 of the nanocomposite membrane with 83 wt% cross-linked PSSA,32 which is higher than the values of commercial membranes such as Nafion™ (0.95–1.01 mmol g−1, DuPont Co., Wilmington, DE, USA), and fumasep® FKB and FKD (1.2–1.4 mmol g−1, FuMA-Tech GmbH, Bietigheim-Bissingen, Germany).116 The protonic conductivity of these conducting membranes measured in the TP configuration is clearly dependent on the relative humidity, temperature and polyelectrolyte content, with RH as the parameter accountable for the most significant differences, reaching 100 mS cm−1 at 94 °C and 98% RH and decreasing to 42 mS cm−1 at 60% RH. Furthermore, the temperature dependency of the conductivity is less pronounced and follows the usual Arrhenius-type behaviour for high humidity (80 and 98% RH) but is better fitted by a VTF-type equation for low RH (≤60%). The VTF-type behaviour assumes a proton transport mechanism assisted by the segmental motion of the cross-linked PSSA chains. It was also reported that the anisotropic morphology of the PSSA/BNC nanocomposites (Fig. 5B and C) influences the ionic conductivity of the developed nanomaterials and concomitantly the performance of air/hydrogen fuel cells.47 In this sense, Gadim et al.47 measured the impedance of the PSSA/BNC membranes in the TP and IP configurations, as illustrated in Fig. 5D, in order to assess the conductivity across the membrane thickness direction and along the membrane surface direction. The preferential orientation of the supporting BNC nanofibrils and that of the PSSA bulk domains along the membrane plane have indeed an impact on the ionic transport across the membrane. According to Fig. 5E, the data for both configurations are approximately similar but with the IP arrangement yielding distinctly higher conductivity values. This behaviour was also reported by Cooper179 for a Nafion™ 112 membrane, which demonstrates the need to perform conductivity measurements in the adequate orientation. Still, the difference between the values of conductivity measured in the TP and IP configurations is reduced as RH increases, possibly because of the development of an extensive network of percolating hydrated domains along the PSSA/BC interface.47 In terms of fuel cell performance, the overall power output under humidified hydrogen/air gradients at room temperature reached a maximum power density of 41 mW cm−2 at a current density of 123 mA cm−2. Moreover, the authors discarded the possibility of membrane degradation during the fuel cell tests since the PSSA/BNC separators maintained their properties, including transparency and mechanical integrity, after the tests.47
An illustrative example of the second strategy to assemble BNC-based conducting membranes includes the work of Jiang et al.164 about BNC/Nafion™ (1:7) membranes prepared by the incorporation of homogenized BNC pulp into a Nafion™ solution followed by solvent casting and annealing at 110 °C for 1 hour. In this approach, the native three-dimensional structure of BNC, and therefore some of its unique properties resulting from the physical entanglement of nanofibers, are lost. Although the systematic analysis of the conductivity of these membranes at variable temperature and relative humidity was not tested, the performance (anode: 1.72 mg cm−2 metal loading (Pt and Ru); cathode: 0.95 mg cm−2 Pt loading) in both PEMFC and DMFC seems to be satisfactory with maximum power densities of 106 and 3.2 mW cm−2 at room temperature, respectively.164
Other investigations deal with the diffusion of an ion conductor into the BNC membrane network.33,36,165,166 Gadim et al.36 studied the diffusion of Nafion™ into the BNC membrane network, but contrary to Jiang et al.,164 the ionomer was simply diffused into the porous structure of BNC. This different approach produced Nafion™/BNC nanocomposite membranes (1:1, Nafion™ to BNC ratio) with improved mechanical performance, namely a higher storage modulus, related to the direct use of BNC as the membrane without homogenization in a food blender followed by casting, as proposed by Jiang and co-workers.164 However, the fuel cell performance (maximum power density: 16 mW cm−2 at a current density of 40 mA cm−2) was five to six times lower than that reported by Jiang et al.164 for a membrane with a BNC to Nafion™ ratio of 1:7. According to Gadim et al.,36 these differences can be assigned (i) to the poor electrode (1 mg cm−2 Pt loading) performance, as suggested by the drop in OCV for small current densities; and (ii) to the lower conductivity (40 mS cm−1 at 40 °C and 98% RH) of the membrane due to the lower ionomer content (BNC to Nafion™ ratio of 1:1). The differences can actually be higher since Gadim et al.36 measured in-plane conductivity while Jiang et al.164 measured the through-plane conductivity, which is usually lower for Nafion™.180
In another study, Jiang et al.33 produced BNC-based membranes doped with phosphoric acid or phytic acid (PA). These PEMs have water-uptake values of about 1.16 g g−1 for H3PO4/BNC and 1.10 g g−1 for PA/BNC membranes, and Young's modulus around 200 MP and 450 MPa for H3PO4(8.4 mol dm−3)/BNC and PA(1.6 mol dm−3)/BNC membranes, respectively. The protonic conductivity of these membranes is temperature dependent and reached values of 150 mS cm−1 and 80 mS cm−1 (at room temperature, IP configuration) for H3PO4/BNC and PA/BNC membranes, respectively. Concerning the fuel cell performance (electrodes: 0.5 mg cm−2 Pt loading), the power output obtained under humidified H2/O2 gradients is rather low, namely 17.9 mW cm−2 (H3PO4/BNC) and 23.0 mW cm−2 (PA/BNC) at a current density of 60 mA cm−2, considering the good protonic conductivity at room temperature, particularly in the case of the H3PO4/BNC membrane.33
Other strategies to assemble BNC-based membrane separators encompass the chemical modification of BNC with protogenic functional groups167–169 or the modification of BNC via grafting polymerization with an electrolyte.34 Yue et al. chemically modified BNC by carboxymethylation167 and sulfonation168 to obtain BNC with carboxymethyl and sulfonate groups, respectively, which were then used to prepare composites with polyaniline via in situ oxidative polymerization of aniline onto the modified-BNC nanofibers. In the first study, a carboxymethylated-BNC/polyaniline composite with a degree of substitution (DS) of ca. 0.15 yielded a membrane with low mechanical properties (Young's modulus: 475 kPa) and a protonic conductivity of 0.252 mS cm−1 at 25 °C (IP configuration).167 The authors claimed that hybrid materials with simultaneous ionic and electric conductivity were obtained. In the second study, the characteristic features of BNC were once again lost by modifying the exopolysaccharide via ring-opening periodate oxidation followed by sulfonation with sodium bisulphite (NaHSO3).168 Despite the good IEC (3.92 mequiv. g−1) and protonic conductivity (5.2 mS cm−1 at 25 °C, IP configuration) of the composite membrane with a sulfonation degree of ca. 42%, the thermal stability is low and the mechanical performance (although not tested) was compromised which is observed just by looking at the morphological micrographs where the three-dimensional nanofibrillar porous structure of BNC is not visible. In both studies,167,168 the authors prepared BNC derivatives, which depending on the DS could be water soluble, which in that case might jeopardize the mechanical integrity of the membranes during the fuel cell operation under variable humidity conditions from dry to saturation. Furthermore, the analysis of the conductivity of both types of membranes at variable temperature and relative humidity, and the validation of their potential as separators in fuel cell tests were not performed.
Lin et al.34 reported the chemical modification of BNC via the UV-induced graft polymerization of 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS) as a strategy to incorporate sulfonic acid groups and circumvent the acid leaching in contact with water. The BNC membrane with an AMPS-grafting degree of 39.5% presents a water-uptake capacity of 264% and an IEC of 1.79 mmol g−1, which translates into a maximum conductivity value of 29 mS cm−1 for the fully hydrated membrane at room temperature (IP configuration). The fuel cell performance is characterized by a maximum power density of 61 mW cm−2 at 30 °C and 97 mW cm−2 at 50 °C. This BNC-grafted membrane exhibits a lower protonic conductivity but a slightly higher cell performance than the PSSA/BNC nanocomposite membrane prepared by Gadim et al.32,47 which also contains sulfonic acid groups (Table 2).
Overall and according to Table 2, PEMs based on BNC are the most investigated membrane systems as a result of their promising water-uptake capacity, mechanical performance, IEC and ionic conductivity and can outperform the well-known Nafion™. In fact, a maximum protonic conductivity of 185 mS cm−1 (at 40 °C, 98% RH, IP) was obtained for a PSSA/BNC-based PEM47 and a maximum power density of 97 mW cm−2 (at 50 °C) was reported for a BNC-g-AMPS based PEM.34 The biggest advantage of BNC, as opposed to CNCs and CNFs, is the ability to be produced directly in the form of membranes or films with a tunable size and shape, since the long-term use of both CNCs and CNFs-based PEMs can be precluded by their dispersibility or disintegration upon exposure to aqueous media. Considering the anisotropic microstructure of the BNC substrate, there are differences in the conductivity values depending on whether the measurements are conducted across the membrane thickness direction or along the membrane surface direction (Fig. 5D), just like in the case of the state-of-the-art PEM.179 Although not all studies compare their membrane systems with the benchmark Nafion™, a considerable number have already performed fuel cell tests to assess the cell performance, and hence, confirm the potential of these BNC-based PEMs for FC applications. Finally, it should be mentioned that none of the studies that assessed the cell performance considered the need to reduce the Pt loading of both electrodes to reach the DOE 2020 technical target for electrocatalysts, as discussed in the section “Overview of fuel cells: Electrodes”.
Nanocellulose-based anion-exchange membranes
Nanocellulose can also be exploited to engineer the core component of polymer electrolyte AFCs, viz. AEMs. Here, the number of studies is limited, but some interesting examples with CNCs,170,171 CNFs172,173 and BNC89,174 are already available, as summarized in Table 2. For instance, Lu et al.170 fabricated cross-linked CNCs-based solid electrolyte membranes using a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)–trimethoxy(methyl)silane polymer hybrid as the binder. The cross-linking of the membranes containing CNCs enabled the development of an AEM with superior dimensional stability when compared with PVA-based materials. The membrane composed of 60 wt% CNCs has a Young's modulus of 65 MPa, water-uptake capacity of ca. 80%, swelling of about 6.5%, and conductivity of 65 mS cm−1 at 60 °C. The downside of this study, apart from the lack of alkaline stability and fuel cell tests, is the fact that no data are provided for the individual components, and thus the contribution of each of them is not discussed; however, the authors managed to develop AEMs with a compromise between low swelling and relatively high conductivity.
Another original addition comes from Cheng et al.171 who studied the incorporation of quaternized cellulose nanocrystals (QCNCs) into a poly(phenylene oxide) (PPO) matrix to prepare AEMs with enhanced conductivity. The functionalization of the nanocellulose with quaternary ammonium groups yielded CNCs with a quaternization degree of 8.85 wt%, which after blending with the quaternized version of PPO (98 wt%) produced a thin membrane (thickness: 20 μm) with a tensile strength of 30.9 MPa (wet), water-uptake capacity of 16.9% and IEC of 1.05 mmol g−1. This membrane presents a maximum hydroxide conductivity of 60 mS cm−1 at 80 °C in the fully hydrated state (IP configuration), which is almost 1.6 times the value of the pure quaternized-PPO matrix. Furthermore, the authors also measured the hydrogen carbonate conductivity in order to suppress the influence of carbon dioxide, and obtained a lower conductivity value, i.e. <25 mS cm−1 at 80 °C in the fully hydrated state, in line with the lower diffusion coefficient of HCO3− compared to hydroxide ions. The thin membrane with low ohmic resistance and alkaline stability was tested in a H2/O2 fuel cell at 60 °C without back pressure and using a MEA with electrodes containing 0.2 mg cm−2 metal loading, which produced a maximum power density of 392 mW cm−2 that is 1.45 times the value of the pure quaternized-PPO matrix.
Peng et al.173 produced thin AEMs based on quaternary ammonia poly(ether ether ketone) (QAPEEK) reinforced with sulfonated CNFs from bamboo (Fig. 6) to minimize the ohmic loss and facilitate the water transport. The authors were able to develop a thin membrane containing ca. 89 wt% QAPEEK and 11 wt% sulfonated CNFs with a thickness of 15 μm, tensile strength of 15.2 MPa, water-uptake capacity of ca. 100%, swelling degree of 7.5% (at 30 and 80 °C), and IEC of 1.76 mmol g−1. The combination of properties of this thin membrane generated a conductivity value of 119 mS cm−1 at 80 °C (when fully hydrated, TP configuration), which culminated in maximum power densities of 740 and 930 mW cm−2 at 60 °C without (0 MPa) and with 0.1 MPa backpressure (Fig. 6), respectively. The cell performance of this membrane was in fact higher when compared to the corresponding thicker membranes (e.g. 28 μm), which can be a direct result of the water transport enhancement from the anode to the cathode side. Moreover, alkaline stability tests were also carried out and the results showed that the conductivity of the membranes decreased from 21.4 to ca. 7 mS cm−1 (at 30 °C) after immersion in 1 M NaOH aqueous solutions at 80 °C for 15 days. Thus, an in-depth analysis on the fuel cell stability should have been performed, despite the authors claiming that it is beyond the scope of the paper.173

Further down the road, the combination of a poly(ionic liquid) and BNC was exploited for the design of functional nanostructured composites with potential application as bio-based anion-exchange membranes.89 The membrane composed of 56 wt% poly(methacroylcholine chloride) (PMACC) and 44 wt% BNC exhibits thermal-oxidative stability up to 210–220 °C, a Young's modulus of 620 MPa, tensile strength of 15.4 MPa, water-uptake capacity of ca. 1550% and IEC of 1.14 mmol g−1. In addition, the through-plane anionic conductivity of the membranes is strongly humidity and temperature dependent and reaches a maximum of 10 mS cm−1 at 94 °C and 98% RH (TP configuration) for the membrane with the highest content of polyelectrolyte (56 wt%). Furthermore, the temperature dependence was fitted for the entire RH range (30–98%) to the typical Arrhenius equation with activation energies for ion transport in the range of 26–41 kJ mol−1. These values might point to a structural diffusion mechanism, but the anion transport mechanisms continue to be highly controversial.123
Zeng et al.174 also used BNC to fabricate AEMs; however the concept behind their membranes is completely different from the previous study. While Vilela et al.89 took advantage of the three-dimensional porous nanofiber web-like entangled morphology to develop BNC-based AEMs by a one-pot methodology, Zeng et al.174 used electrostatic spinning technology to obtain TiO2/BNC regenerated hybrid nanofibers that were then functionalized with quaternary ammonium groups followed by blending with PVA and casting to obtain the final conducting AEM. The membrane with a DS of ca. 1.4 possesses a tensile strength of 25.18 MPa, water-uptake capacity of 167% and IEC of 0.99 mmol g−1. Once again, the conductivity is temperature dependent and reached a maximum of 93 mS cm−1 at 80 °C (IP configuration). Despite the absence of fuel cell tests under humidified hydrogen/air gradients, both studies designed AEMs with potential for application in FCs.89,174
Just as in the case of nanocellulose-based PEMs, the demonstration of the potential of AEMs based on nanocellulose mainly lacks the fuel cell tests to assess their performance and also the comparison with commercial anion-exchange membranes. Besides, the overall performance of nanocellulose-based AEMs is far behind that of the extensively studied PEMs (and particularly the benchmark Nafion™), and thus, there is still a long way to go to fully mature this topic to move from the laboratory to the commercial stage.
Nanocellulose-based electrocatalysts
As aforementioned, the electrodes are also key components of PEFCs because they are the place where the electrochemical reactions occur, namely the HOR and ORR. Nevertheless, the conventional catalysts that are being used to accelerate both electrochemical reactions (in acidic media) are based on Pt and its alloys, which, apart from the associated high cost and scarcity of this precious metal, are prone to CO poisoning, fuel crossover and long-term instability.152 Hence, the reduction or elimination of Pt-loading of the conventional Pt/C-based electrocatalysts, while preserving or improving the catalyst activity and durability, is a major goal for developing more economical, sustainable and highly effective electrocatalysts. Furthermore, durability shortfalls can often be attributed to the degradation (in acidic media) of the carbon supporting material, viz. carbon black or activated carbon, which promotes corrosion at voltages above ∼0.9 V and hence leads to catalyst failure.150 Therefore, alternative substrates in the form of non-carbonaceous (e.g., TiO2, SnO2, SiO2, Nb2O5 and RuO2) or carbonaceous (e.g., graphene, carbon nanotubes and heteroatom-doped carbon materials) nanomaterials are also being studied as potential catalyst supports that might be stable under the required electrochemical conditions and in strongly acidic/alkaline environments.17,150
In this context, the use of abundant renewable resources to engineer less expensive electrocatalysts, particularly to accelerate the sluggish cathodic ORR, is considered an attractive path. Herein, the nanocellulose trio also has potential as electroactive porous carbon nanostructures for both the HOR and the ORR. The major routes that have been used to design nanocellulose-based electrocatalysts include its combination with Pt-based,181,182 other metal-based183,184 and metal-free catalysts.52,185,186 The simple use of nanocellulose in tandem with Pt or Pt-metal alloys is an approach that will not maximize the reduction or elimination of Pt usage and simultaneously take full advantage of the unique features of the nanocellulose substrates. Actually, the substantial reduction or elimination of the Pt-loading is highly desirable and developing metal-free catalysts is the future direction for electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity, cost effectiveness and long-term stability.17
From the standpoint of this review, the metal-free approach is the most suitable to develop more economical and sustainable electrocatalysts based on nanocellulose. Hence, this section will highlight the endeavour to develop environmentally friendly alternatives to Pt/C electrocatalysts based on nanocellulose in the attempt to mitigate the impact and cost of their production. The subsequent paragraphs will outline the studies that have been reported in the last couple of years regarding nanocellulose-based electrocatalysts for the HOR and ORR electrochemical reactions. Table 3 compiles the most sound and recent examples of hetero-atom nanocellulose-based electrocatalysts for the cathodic ORR.

Nanocellulose-based electrocatalysts for the anodic HOR
The number of studies concerning the anodic HOR is quite limited because this electrochemical reaction is intrinsically fast, and the required Pt-loading is low. Therefore, the existing studies deal only with the reduction of the Pt-metal loading via the development of supporting nanocellulose-derived porous carbon and no success in replacing noble metals was yet accomplished. Examples of such nanocellulose-based materials for the anodic HOR, include the work by Yun et al.187 and Aritonang et al.188 who developed anodic electrodes based on BNC and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). In the former study, porous carbon nanotube electrodes supported by BNC were prepared by the introduction of MWCNTs inside and outside of the BNC three-dimensional nanofibrillar network using ultrasound treatment and vacuum filtration, followed by surface deposition of Pt/MWCNTs via vacuum filtration, and finally freeze drying. The electrodes with a macroporous network inner-structure containing a Pt loading of 0.4 mg cm−2 acted simultaneously as the GDL and CL and exhibited an electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 10.1 m2 g−1 that is lower than that of the typical electrode of carbon cloth/Pt/carbon black (14.3 m2 g−1). Still, the main pitfall of this study lies in the absence of any test that could actually validate the application of the macroporous BNC-based electrode as a catalyst for the HOR (or even for the ORR).187 In the second study, Pt nanoparticles (3–11 nm) and MWCNTs were incorporated into BNC by impregnation of a water solution of metal precursors (PtCl4, K2PtCl4 or H2PtCl6) and MWCNTs followed by a reduction reaction using hydrogen gas. Despite the lack of electrocatalytic characterization of the anode catalyst, the authors were able to assemble the MEA by sandwiching a Nafion™ PEM between the cathode (carbon paper/Pt/carbon black) and anode (Pt/MWCNTs/BNC), and evaluated the fuel cell performance. Although the maximum power density only reached 0.13 mW cm−2 at 70 °C, the Pt/MWCNTs/BNC anode could function as a catalyst for the HOR.188
Nanocellulose-based electrocatalysts for the cathodic ORR
Metal-free carbon-based electrocatalysts such as heteroatom-doped carbon nanomaterials exhibit high catalytic activity and durability as well as cost effectiveness. Nevertheless, the absence of heteroatoms in the structure of nanocellulose requires co-doping with two or more heteroatoms, prior to conversion into carbon materials via simple carbonization, to improve their electrocatalytic activity.152 CNCs have already been N- and Co-doped,185,186 while CNFs were N,P,S-doped52 and BNC was N-doped,189–193 N,S-doped,51 P,Fe-doped194 and Co,Fe-doped.195
An interesting case of work that employs nanocellulose as the cathode component for the ORR is the study by Liu et al.185 which combined CNCs with urea to produce porous carbon aerogels via freeze drying and pyrolysis without using any catalysts or post-treatments. The ensuing two-dimensional carbon nanosheets with abundant N-involved defect sites (3.51 atom% N), high specific surface area (ca. 1362 m2 g−1) and large pore volume (3.36 cm3 g−1) demonstrated a boosted catalytic performance toward the ORR in an alkaline medium (O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte) with a close onset potential and ca. 20 mV more positive half-wave potential when compared with commercial Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, this study confirmed the unique role of urea since the alternative use of NH3 as a nitrogen source for CNC doping, and FeCl3 as a catalyst to promote graphitization, produced nanomaterials with an unsatisfactory morphology, lower nitrogen content and inferior catalytic activity. According to the authors, this metal-free nanomaterial with superior operating durability over commercial Pt/C catalysts can be considered a promising Pt-alternative cathode electrocatalyst for alkaline fuel cells.
In a different study, Mulyadi et al.52 fabricated multi-element doped metal-free carbon hybrids composed of N,S-doped CNFs and N,P-doped carbon nanoparticles, as depicted in Fig. 7A. These heteroatom-doped CNF nanomaterials have good functionality toward ORR activity, as specified by the reduction of the onset overpotentials. The ORR performance exhibited an onset potential 10 mV more negative than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts, as well as a cathodic peak of 0.84 V (vs. RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode). The long-term stability of the metal-free heteroatom-doped CNFs electrocatalyst with a surface area of 682 m2 g−1 was tested by cyclic voltammetry for 1500 continuous cycles. Fig. 7B shows a relatively stable ORR performance before and after the test, which demonstrates a fairly good long-term stability toward the ORR process in an alkaline medium (O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte).52

Several papers have been published regarding BNC-based electrocatalysts for the ORR via doping of carbonaceous nanocellulose with, for instance, nitrogen,189–191,193 silver,196 nitrogen and sulphur,51 iron and phosphorus,194 and cobalt ferrite.195 An example of a BNC carbonaceous-supported catalyst doped with nitrogen was published by Ye et al.193 who manufactured a highly efficient metal-free electrocatalyst (Fig. 8A) labelled “vein-leaf”. While the BNC-derived carbon nanofibers (prepared via in situ carbonization) worked as the “vein” skeleton, the N-doped graphene from urea (N-source and sacrificial template) acted as the “leaf”, as portrayed in Fig. 8B–E. This hybrid structure composed of hard and conductive carbon nanofibers and soft and active N-doped graphene (9.82 atom% N) leads to a three-dimensional robust porous network that favoured both mass and electron transfer (Fig. 8F). The unique “vein-leaf” structure with a specific surface area of 206 m2 g−1 promoted electrocatalytic activity for the ORR in an alkaline medium (O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte) with an onset potential of 930 mV (vs. RHE), half-wave potential of 800 mV (vs. RHE) and limiting current density of 5.0 mA cm−2 at 0.4 V (vs. RHE), which is higher than the values obtained for the corresponding individual components. Additionally, the transferred electrons varied between 3.6 and 4.0 over the entire range of potentials (0.2–0.7 V), which is indicative of an efficient four electron-dominated ORR process, fairly approaching that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalysts. This hybrid BNC-based “vein-leaf” electrode also exhibited a high chemical stability since it tolerated a highly corrosive electrolyte (e.g., 1 and 6 M KOH) and 90.1% of the relative current persisted after 10 hours in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution, which unveiled its high durability for the ORR process.193

Another original example was reported by Liu et al.51 who studied the potential of heteroatom-doped BNC carbonaceous materials for the development of an efficient electrocatalyst to decrease the overpotential of the ORR. The nitrogen and sulphur co-doped carbon nanofibers were prepared via in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of methylene blue on the BNC nanofibers, followed by a carbonization process. The resulting N,S-doped (3.2 and 0.8 atom% N and S, respectively) carbon nanofibers derived from BNC (surface area of 729 m2 g−1) presented a half-wave potential (0.80 V vs. RHE) comparable to that of the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst (0.83 V vs. RHE). The cyclic voltammetry analysis in O2-saturated electrolyte (0.1 M KOH) also displayed a cathodic peak at 0.78 V, and the limiting current density reached ca. 5.5 mA cm−2 at 0.4 V (vs. RHE). Besides, the transferred electron number per oxygen molecule involved in the ORR process was ca. 3.89 (potential range of 0.4–0.6 V) which indicates a nearly four-electron pathway for the ORR catalysed by this metal-free porous electrocatalyst. Finally, the heteroatom-doped BNC electrode has fairly good durability since the oxygen reduction current remained constant during the entire polarization time (100 min), whereas the current at the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C electrode decreased ca. 77% during the same test period.51
As a general comment, the use of nanocellulose to produce ORR electrocatalysts upon transformation into active carbon is an attractive strategy to develop cheaper and renewable-based electrocatalysts. In fact, the customizable properties of nanocellulose-based materials, viz. stability, tunable morphology and functionalities, enable the design of electrocatalysts with a maximized active surface area and thus suitable activity and durability. According to Table 3, most studies on nanocellulose-based electrocatalysts were performed with an alkaline electrolyte because the ORR is favoured in an alkaline medium, which enables the utilization of Pt-free or heteroatom-doped electrocatalysts.152 Although the majority of the studies focus on the ORR and less on the HOR, the measurement of the ORR activity is not always performed under realistic conditions, as recently claimed by Inaba and co-workers.197
Nanocellulose-based components for MFCs
Another class of FCs at the spotlight are microbial fuel cells (MFCs), which are bioreactors that use microorganisms as electrocatalysts to convert organic and inorganic matter via oxidation into electrical energy.198,199 The MFC technology provides sustainable solutions for simultaneous (bio)electricity (or (bio)hydrogen) generation, and wastewater treatment,199 as well as for powering small biosensor devices.200,201
The typical designs of operation for MFCs can include one or two chamber components. The single-chamber configuration presents simplicity of design and cost reduction, since it eliminates the need for a cathodic chamber by directly exposing the cathode to air. Furthermore, this set-up presents a low power output and can operate with or without the use of an ion-exchange membrane.199 In turn, the double-chamber configuration (Fig. 9) is characterized by an anaerobic anodic chamber and an aerobic cathodic chamber that are connected by an external circuit and separated by an ion-exchange membrane.199
 Fig. 9  Scheme of a double-chamber microbial fuel cell, (A) bacterial anaerobic compartment with the anode, and (B) aerobic compartment with the cathode. Reprinted with permission from ref. 202 copyright 2014 Elsevier. 
In terms of operation, the microorganisms present in the anodic chamber oxidize the selected substrate existing in the anolyte, which generates carbon dioxide, protons and electrons, as outlined in Table 4. Afterwards, the protons migrate to the cathode through the ion-exchange membrane, while the electrons reach the cathode via the external circuit. The overall reaction using acetate as an example of anolyte (and oxygen as a cathodic electron acceptor) corresponds to the substrate breakdown into carbon dioxide and water (Table 4), together with the concomitant production of electrical energy.199

The basic components of the MFC are constructed using different materials that endow them with the required function and are the culprits of the high cost of these systems. Among these basic components, the membrane separator,204 the anode205,206 and the cathode207,208 are the ones that have the most significant effect on the performance of these microbial-powered FCs: the anode because of its ability to act at the same time as a support for microbial attachment and as a reservoir for electrons from substrate metabolism;205 the cathode given its ability to reduce the electron acceptors;207 and the membrane owing to its aptitude to reduce oxygen crossover from the cathode to the anode and substrate crossover from the anode to the cathode.209 Furthermore, the type of electron acceptor (e.g., ferricyanide, permanganate, nitrate, iron, perchlorate and aqueous or gaseous O2) also plays a part in the MFC performance since it is responsible for receiving electrons in the cathode.210
The list of exoelectrogenic microorganisms capable of generating electricity in MFCs is extensive (e.g., Geobacter sulfurreducens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Shewanella putrefaciens and Rhodopseudomonas palustris211), nevertheless the majority of them are still understudied and their behaviour (either in the form of pure or mixed cultures) is not yet fully understood.203,212
The MFCs operated with mixed cultures usually reach higher power densities than those with pure exoelectrogens.203 The electron transfer mechanism from the microorganisms to the electrodes can occur via three main pathways,211 namely: (i) the direct electron transfer through redox-active proteins on the outer membrane of the microorganisms, (ii) the mediator-based electron transfer utilizing exogenous or endogenous electron mediators, and (iii) the direct electron transfer via type IV pili (proteinaceous appendages and bacterial nanowires), as listed in a recent review by Li and co-workers.203 The use of exogenous electron mediators (external to the cell, e.g., methylene blue, thionine and neutral red) is not prevalent due to their high cost, short lifetime and toxicity towards microorganisms.199,203
The nature of the substrate present in the anolyte also plays an important role in the MFC performance because the feedstock is the one that powers the microorganisms.203,213 Commonly used substrates include pure compounds such as acetate,214,215 lactate,216 glucose,217,218 and cellulose,219,220 as well as complex mixtures of organic components present in wastewater,213 namely domestic wastewater,221–223 dairy wastewater,224,225 brewery wastewater,226,227 winery wastewater,228 and slaughterhouse wastewater.229
According to some authors, the MFC technology is not expected to see the light of day at an industrial level in a foreseeable time frame because of several operational constraints that are undermining their scale-up.199,230 Future research directions should focus on the metabolic mechanism, reactor architecture, MFC stacking and power collection and utilization.199 Although the use of MFCs as an alternative to other FCs is not yet practical for continuous energy production, their implementation is a promising alternative to conventional aerated activated sludge for wastewater treatment, and exhibits potential economic benefits as claimed by Trapero and co-workers.231 Further information regarding MFCs can be explored in recently published comprehensive reviews.199,203,205,212,232–235
Despite the burgeoning research only a small number of studies address the use of eco-friendly MFC components. Within these studies, some deal with ionic liquids and their polymeric analogous,216,229,236 and also with natural materials derived from biopolymers, such as chitosan,237,238 cellulose218,239–242 and silk fibroin.243 Nanocellulosic substrates have already made their debut as MFC components, as outlined in the following paragraphs and compiled in Table 5. Among the three types of nanocellulose, BNC is the most studied to devise all basic MFC components, namely the PEM,218 anode241,242,244 and cathode.240

For example, Ko et al.218 investigated the use of a BNC pellicle as a proton-permeable membrane in a double-chamber MFC, where carbon plates with a surface area of 460 cm2 were used as both the anode and the cathode, neutral red as the redox mediator, microbial consortia from a lake deposited soil as exoelectrogens and glucose as the substrate. This set-up generated an average current of 120 μA with the BNC pellicle during 18 days of operation with an external resistance of 1 Ω, which is a 3-fold higher efficiency for electric power than that of the commercial cation-exchange membrane Neosepta CMX (40 μA). The use of an exogenous redox mediator (neutral red: 1 μM) in the MFC system yielded a maximum power density of 195 mW m−2 per anode surface area. Nevertheless, these results are ambiguous because BNC is the purest form of cellulose and, as such, no carboxylic groups (as claimed by the authors) should be present in its structure, and this exopolysaccharide by itself is not a proton conducting material, as discussed elsewhere.32 Furthermore, no polarization curve is provided and the information regarding the electrochemical measurements is nowhere to be found.218
Alternatively, Mashkour et al.241,242 reported the application of pure BNC as a hydrogel bioanode in a double-chamber MFC operating with a graphite plate as the cathode, Nafion™ as the PEM, mixed cultures from anaerobic sludge as exoelectrogens and glucose as the substrate. A maximum power density of 2.2 mW m−2 at a current density of 14 mA m−2 was obtained (Table 5), which is superior to the values generated when graphite was used as the anode, ca. 1 mW m−2. The authors also claimed that the power density is influenced by the concentration of the substrate in the anolyte.242 Besides the lower power density attained with BNC as a hydrogel anode, this exopolysaccharide might become a substrate for the mixed culture microorganisms, and jeopardize the anode durability.241
Another example worth mentioning was reported by Zou et al.244 who used a carbonized BNC aerogel (pyrolysis at 600–1100 °C under an argon atmosphere) as the anode in a double-chamber MFC with a carbon fibre brush as the cathode, Nafion™ as the PEM, Shewanella putrefaciens CN32 as exoelectrogens and lactate as the substrate. The size of the three-dimensional porous interconnected network structure of the carbonized BNC aerogel deeply affected the direct electrochemistry in the MFC system. In fact, the BNC aerogel, pyrolyzed at 600 °C, yielded a microporous anode (total pore volume: 0.71 cm3 g−1) with a maximum power density of 582 mW m−2, while the BNC pyrolysis at 1000 °C produced a mesoporous anode (1.73 cm3 g−1) that delivered a maximum power density of 1747 mW m−2. Furthermore, the mesoporous BNC anode exhibits an output power density that is ca. 14-fold higher than that of the conventional carbon cloth anode (127 mW m−2), along with good stability for long-time operation.244
Further investigations by Mashkour et al.241,242 demonstrated the potential of using BNC-based nanocomposites containing polyaniline241 or polypyrrole242 as anodes. The wet nanostructured BNC-based anodes were tested in a double-chamber MFC operating with a graphite plate as the cathode, Nafion™ as the PEM, mixed cultures from anaerobic sludge as exoelectrogens and glucose as the substrate. This mediator-less MFC system reached a maximum power density of ca. 118 mW m−2 at a current density of 617 mA m−2 for the BNC/polyaniline anode241 and a maximum power density of 136 mW m−2 at a current density of 662 mA m−2 for the BNC/polypyrrole anode.242 The use of BNC as a porous media hydrogel in conjunction with conductive polymers (i.e., polyaniline and polypyrrole) yielded superior power and current densities to those of pure (unmodified) BNC (i.e., 2.2 mW m−2 and 14 mA m−2, respectively) and graphite plates (i.e., 1 mW m−2 and 10 mA m−2, respectively) as anodes.241,242
Equally interesting is the work carried out by Ci et al.240 about the development of a GDL based on CNFs (from corncob cellulose) esterified with hexanoyl chloride (DS: 0.7). This CNFs-based cathodic GDL with 18–25 μm thickness was tested in a membrane-less single-chamber cubic air-cathode MFC with a mixed bacterial culture dominated by Clostridium pasteurianum as exoelectrogens. The studied CNF-based GDL was able to enhance the oxygen diffusion into the MFC and diminish the ohmic and charge transfer resistances when compared to a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-based GDL. Furthermore, the air-cathode fabricated with the CNF-based GDL reached an output voltage of about 574 mV and a maximum power density of ca. 1518 mW m−2, which are 7.5% and 30.1%, respectively, higher than the output values recorded for the MFC system using a PTFE-based GDL.240
One aspect that should be highlighted is that most of the studies dealing with nanocellulose-based components for MFCs are focused only on the electrochemical performance of the device, and less on the assessment of the long-term durability of the components in terms of chemical stability, and resistance to fouling, clogging and biodegradation promoted by the exoelectrogens. Furthermore, there is almost no evaluation of the material costs and no focus is placed on the MFC duality for bioelectricity production and bioremediation.
Despite the copious research, the application of nanocellulose-based materials in MFCs is still an unripe topic that represents a window of opportunity in terms of exploration of the feasibility of these nanomaterials as membrane separators or electrodes for MFC devices.
Conclusions and insights into the future
Fossil fuels will have to be phased out in medium/long-term and the human dependence on these non-renewable energy vectors can be attenuated by developing clean technology solutions that can compete with the conventional ones as endorsed by the Paris Climate Change Agreement.245 Fuel cells, i.e. an efficient and clean mechanism for energy conversion, are one of those technologies that together with the hydrogen economy might contribute to the sustainable development of society by curbing climate change associated with greenhouse-gas emissions.
The underlying fragility of these truly environmentally conscious systems is associated with the need for very cheap and reliable FCs with abundant hydrogen refuelling stations and pipeline systems for hydrogen transportation over long distances. Research efforts are being directed towards the reduction of the overall FC costs via (i) maximization of the individual cell performance, (ii) minimization of the amount of electrocatalyst and polyelectrolyte material used per unit active area, and (iii) the design of alternative materials based on non-noble metal catalysts and naturally derived polymeric membranes with reduced cost.17,246
The present review ventured into the question “Do the nanoscale forms of cellulose have potential in fuel cell systems?”, and the answer is simple: it is a reality and not a hype. In fact, nanocellulosic substrates (CNCs, CNFs and BNC) can contribute to the evolution toward efficient, sustainable and economical nanomaterials as substrates for fuel cell components, particularly the ion-exchange membrane and the electrocatalysts. CNCs, CNFs and BNC-based nanomaterials can indeed compete with the expensive but well-established ion conductors such as Nafion™, since these nanomaterials (after amenable surface modification or in conjugation with ion conducting phases) can conduct ions (H+ or OH−) between the electrodes, and simultaneously act as a barrier for electrons, fuel and oxidizing gases, along with good mechanical performance. Several prominent examples of nanocellulose-based PEMs and AEMs are compiled in Table 2, with one of the membranes able to generate an anionic conductivity value of 119 mS cm−1 at 80 °C (when fully hydrated), which culminated in a maximum power density of 930 mW cm−2 at 60 °C with 0.1 MPa backpressure.173
The nanocellulose trio also has the potential to be applied as electroactive-based porous carbon nanostructures for both the HOR and ORR occurring at the anode and cathode, respectively. Actually, these nanomaterials have adequate physicochemical properties and electrocatalytic activity (upon transformation into active carbon), particularly for the case of the ORR, which is the most studied electrochemical reaction. The tendency is to design heteroatom-doped carbon nanostructures with a robust three-dimensional network (Table 3) and comparable (or even superior) catalytic activity to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. In the case of the anode electrode for the HOR, the story is different, and the limited number of studies deals only with the reduction of the metal loading via the development of supporting nanocellulose-derived porous carbon and no success in replacing noble metals was yet accomplished.
Regarding key obstacles, a considerable number of studies have not performed fuel cell tests to evaluate the cell performance when using nanocellulose-based ion-exchange membranes or electrocatalysts, so as to really confirm their potential for FC applications. Furthermore, most of the nanocellulose-based materials are not being tested under realistic operating conditions and thus there is a need for advanced characterization approaches that can deliver adequate information about the in situ structure–property correlations of the individual materials and their interactions with the other components. Another issue that is usually neglected or barely studied in the available literature is the post-mortem failure analysis of all components that will provide valuable information regarding durability19 and mechanisms of degradation.247 The optimization of the failure modes associated with PEMs, AEMs, anode and cathode electrocatalysts (and also with MEAs, stacks, etc.) will enable the rationale design via computational modelling of robust PEFCs with higher performance metrics. Moreover, the assessment of the costs associated with each of the alternative FC components that are being devised is also being overlooked. Nonetheless, the copious and creative studies found in the literature are providing new directions for the manufacture of nanocellulose-based membranes and electrocatalysts for FCs, but the commercial prospects are not yet conspicuous since the untenable long-term stability is the major hurdle hampering their commercial translation.
Nanocellulose-based membranes and electrodes have also been applied as components of MFC devices that produce electricity by using the metabolic energy of microorganisms, but to a lesser extent when compared to the other FC types. Still, the MFC components derived from nanocellulose as an alternative to the expensive commercial ones are an unripe research area since these devices are not yet practical for continuous energy production despite the efforts of the multitude of scientists working in this domain.
The future offers high hopes for nanocellulose as a purveyor of bio-based components for PEFCs since these nanomaterials are appropriate substrates to engineer both the ion-exchange membrane and the catalyst layer (anode and cathode). The enduring scientific and technological improvements in terms of basic research and scale-up will contribute to mitigate the impact and cost of their production.
