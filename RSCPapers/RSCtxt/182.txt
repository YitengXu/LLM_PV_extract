    , Accepted 16th July 2012First published on 3rd August 2012AbstractProjected growth in global population and continued industrialization of developing countries will increase total world energy consumption by 50% between 2008 and 2035 (U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), International Energy Outlook, DOE/EIA-0484(2011) (Washington, DC, September 2011)). This demand for energy will be largely met by burning more fossil fuels, thereby increasing anthropogenic carbon in the atmosphere and further fuelling geopolitical conflicts over control of dwindling energy resources. Recycling CO2 by splitting it in a solar-based thermochemical process is an attractive solution to both of these 21st century problems. In this communication, we examine a novel chemistry for a two-step, non-volatile metal oxide CO2 splitting cycle that shuttles iron oxidation states (Fe2+/3+) between CoFe2O4 and FeAl2O4 spinel compounds within a nano-engineered material. This chemistry is dramatically different than current metal oxide cycles that exploit oxygen non-stoichiometry in ceria or solid solution behaviour in ferrites. The engineered material was prepared using atomic layer deposition and maintained structural integrity over 6 heating cycles under conditions that mimic a concentrated solar power application, namely an oxidation temperature of 1000 °C, reduction at 1460 °C, and a heating rate of 16 °C s−1 from low to high temperature. Oxygen uptake and release behaviour was similar to that of ceria. Raman spectroscopy was used to verify cycle chemistry.

Broader context
Solar thermochemical splitting of CO2 into CO and O2 to produce a sustainable fuel is an attractive method to reduce the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The prototypical two step CO2 splitting process uses an iron oxide based thermochemical cycle. However, thermal instability of the iron oxide based material, i.e. the formation of a molten/slag phase upon repeated thermal cycling, leads to loss of activity. In this communication, we discuss the application of “hercynite” redox chemistry in a nano-engineered structure for the high temperature solar thermochemical carbon dioxide splitting process. The oxygen uptake/release capacity of the active material is consistent from cycle to cycle indicating that the activity is not affected by loss of internal surface area. Furthermore, the active material can be thermally reduced to a sufficient extent at temperatures that are ∼150 °C lower than the traditional iron oxide based cycle.

Energy security and climate change are linked by the burning of fossil fuels, and as such major research and development efforts around the world are focused on CO2 capture and sequestration,2–4 or re-use by conversion to liquid hydrocarbon fuels.5–9 Two-step solar thermochemical processes based on non-volatile metal oxide cycles are an attractive alternative to biomass production and processing, artificial photosynthesis, and photovoltaic-driven electrolysis because they have the potential to operate at higher thermal efficiencies, are technologically less challenging to implement, and require less land and water to operate.7,10 There are also other two-step cycles based on volatile metal oxides, such as the Zn/ZnO cycle, which has been extensively studied and is reviewed elsewhere.11 A generic two-step cycle based on ceria is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. Heat derived from concentrated solar energy thermally reduces ceria to a sub-stoichiometric oxide (CeO2−δ) at temperatures between 1350 °C and 1500 °C, producing O2 (step 1). The CeO2−δ is then taken out of the sunlight and oxidized at 1000 °C by exposure to CO2, thus producing CO fuel (step 2) and completing the cycle. Steam can also be used as an oxidant to produce H2.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of a two-step thermochemical cycle for splitting CO2 using undoped cerium oxide. 
Traditionally, two types of non-volatile metal oxide redox chemistries are utilized in solar thermochemical CO2 splitting. The first is based on the aforementioned non-stoichiometric oxides of which ceria is a representative example. Redox materials of fluorite or perovskite type crystal structures are thermally reduced without undergoing phase change, as the lattice is able to accommodate the strain induced by oxygen vacancy formation. These materials are thermally quite stable, although the extent of reduction, and hence cycle capacity, is small compared to other reducible oxides.7,12,13 Doping or lattice site substitution strategies are often employed with these oxides in order to introduce crystallographic defects that improve cycle capacity or decrease temperatures required for thermal reduction.14–18
The second prototypical chemistry utilizes materials of the spinel structure that form solid solutions upon reduction. The most common are ferrites where Fe3+ in MxFe3−xO4 is partially reduced to Fe2+; here M can be any number of transition metals that form spinel type oxides with iron though Co, Zn, and Ni are the most studied.5,19–25 In these redox cycles, the ferrite spinel is heated until it decomposes into a mixture of metal oxide solid solutions that are thermodynamically stable at temperatures above which the spinel decomposes.21 Thus, thermal reduction yields a solid solution of oxides with mixed valencies (M2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+). While these materials theoretically exhibit a greater redox potential than non-stoichiometric oxides, in practice deactivation induced by irreversible processes such as sintering or the formation of liquid phases and metal vaporization lead to loss of active oxide. One strategy for improving mechanical integrity and cycle durability has been to combine these substituted ferrites with refractory materials such as zirconia or yttrium stabilized zirconia.20,23
In both the non-stoichiometric oxide and ferrite chemistries, the redox active cation is stabilized within a homogenous system where multivalency coexists, Ce3+/Ce4+ in ceria and Fe2+/Fe3+ in solid solution. Here we investigate a novel third type of redox chemistry. Similar to the ferrite cycle, this chemistry utilizes the oxidation state change of the iron cation (Fe2+/Fe3+). However, unlike the ferrites this approach proceeds by stabilizing the reduced and oxidized moieties in two different compounds. This cycle was first demonstrated by Scheffe et al.,26 who synthesized a thin film of CoFe2O4 spinel on a bulk Al2O3 support and discovered that incorporation of cobalt into a ferrite spinel allows for the formation and decomposition of FeAl2O4 (hercynite) upon reduction and oxidation, respectively.
So-called the “hercynite cycle”, reduction chemistry occurs via a reaction between decomposition products of the CoFe2O4 and Al2O3, forming the corresponding stable aluminates CoAl2O4 and FeAl2O4 according to the following oxygen evolution reaction: (1)
During subsequent oxidation by CO2, the cobalt ferrite spinel and alumina are reformed and CO is produced: CoAl2O4 + 2FeAl2O4 + CO2 → CoFe2O4 + 3Al2O3 + CO(2)
The oxygen evolution reaction (eqn (1)) occurs to a greater extent at a temperature 150 °C lower than a similarly prepared CoFe2O4-coated m-ZrO2 because compound formation is thermodynamically more favourable than solid solution formation.26 While lowering the reduction temperature is an important consideration for solar thermochemical technologies, perhaps more intriguing is the idea of binding the reduced iron in a compound that is more stable than solid solution.
Inspired by these initial observations, we deposited a nanometer thick film of CoFe2O4 on a porous thin-walled (15 nm) skeletal Al2O3 support to study the CO2 splitting capability of this material for use in a concentrated solar power application. The reactive structure is depicted schematically in Fig. 2, along with optical images of the sample material photographed in the oxidized and reduced states, and an FESEM image of the alumina support before thermal cycling. The cartoon in Fig. 2 implies that the CoFe2O4 film is located on the exterior surface of the support shell, but the ALD process ensures that the ferrite film covers all gas-accessible surfaces on and within the porous material. As a result, the cobalt ferrite mass loading is relatively high (20%) and the reactive structure maintains a high effective surface area and low bulk density prior to high-temperature thermal cycling.

Schematic illustrating the conceptual layout of the nano-engineered reactive structure, not drawn to scale, and the spinel compound that forms upon calcination (bottom right). A representative FESEM image of the skeletal structure is incorporated into the schematic. The coverage of CoFe2O4 on the alumina scaffold is not limited to the outer surface; it coats all gas-accessible surfaces on and within the porous structure (see text). 
The main benefit of this reactive structure that sets it apart from the work by Scheffe et al. is that we can better engineer the spinel–alumina interface. Ideally we would like to irradiate only redox active material, any excess Al2O3 would reduce process efficiency by heating the inert carrier. Deposition of CoFe2O4 on either high surface area Al2O3 powders or monoliths would be undesirable because too much inert material would end up in the structure. Perhaps more important than wasting heat, a large excess of alumina would lead to diffusion of Co and Fe deeply into the bulk and undoubtedly have a detrimental impact on the redox kinetics. The porous Al2O3 skeletal support with 15 nm wall thickness addresses both of these concerns.
O2 oxidation and redox chemistry
An important measure of a material's suitability for a thermochemical carbon dioxide splitting cycle is the extent to which oxygen exchange occurs upon heating and cooling. This activity was assessed by exposing the nano-engineered material to a gas flow containing 2000 ppm O2 in helium and rapidly heating and cooling the material while monitoring the O2 uptake and release behaviour. The results of this experiment are presented in Fig. 3. Starting at t = 0 s, a constant background of O2 is measured by the mass spectrometer. At several time intervals spaced roughly 350 s apart, a laser irradiates the sample raising the temperature from 1000 °C to 1460 °C in 30 s. After a 100 s dwell at 1460 °C, the laser power is turned off and the sample is allowed to cool through conductive, convective, and radiative processes.
 Fig. 3  Oxygen uptake and release behaviour as a function of time and temperature measured in the presence of a constant 2000 ppm O2 background partial pressure indicates that thermodynamics for hercynite reduction are favourable for solar-driven thermochemical cycles (see text). The reduction extent as a function of temperature for ceria and hercynite at two different heating rates is shown in the inset. 
According to the data in Fig. 3, during the initial part of the heating interval the O2 signal increases to a peak that is 47% above background, then quickly falls back to baseline before the 100 s dwell time at high temperature expires. O2 evolution in a gaseous environment where the oxygen activity is relatively high (0.001 atm.) indicates favourable thermodynamics for reduction at conditions relevant to solar-driven thermochemistry. Of equal importance is the observation that the material reabsorbs oxygen on cooling, which is evidenced by the O2 signal dropping below the 2000 ppm background level for a short period of time after laser irradiation. To a first approximation, the area under the desorption peak is equal to that of the absorption peak (∼100 μmoles O2 per g of material). Furthermore, the O2 redox behaviour is reproducible over 6 heating cycles indicating that the material remains chemically active and is structurally stable (i.e., no significant irreversible loss of activity, surface area, physical dimension, or metal oxide).
Optical images of the sample taken before and after thermal redox cycling (Fig. 2) show that the material maintains its semi-spherical shape, however, noticeable shrinkage occurs during repeated exposures to 1460 °C. BET analysis on similarly cycled materials confirms internal structural changes that are consistent with loss of porosity and sphere volume as the surface area is reduced from 44 m2 g−1 (as prepared) to 1.6 m2 g−1 (cycled). This is due to collapse of the micropores and mesopores in the alumina material resulting from grain growth at these extreme temperatures.27,28 Nonetheless, after the first cycle, the oxygen capacity did not diminish after 23 thermal reductions, amounting to 20 hours at 1000 °C and 2 hours at 1460 °C, implying that the activity of the material is not affected by loss of internal surface area and that all structural changes occurred during the first cycle. A more rigorous and detailed study investigating the effect of porosity and the thermal stability of the material is currently underway. Also of note is the colour of the material before and after thermal reduction. The brown colour associated with oxidation is indicative of either cobalt ferrite or iron aluminate, while the blue-green hue on the reduced material is due to cobalt aluminate.
The graph inset to Fig. 3 reveals another important feature of our engineered reactive structure. Here we plot the reduction extent as a function of temperature for two different heating rates. The reduction extent is calculated by taking the ratio of evolved oxygen, integrated as a function of time on a molar basis, to the total amount of oxygen present in the fully oxidized material. There are two pieces of information available in Fig. 3; (1) by comparing a slow heating rate (2 °C s−1) to a fast heating rate (16 °C s−1) possible kinetic limitations to O2 redox become evident, and (2) the reduction extent for a given temperature provides information on the cycle capacity (i.e., how much fuel can be produced per mole of material). For comparison, reduction data are also presented for CeO2 particles (nominally 5 μm diameter) in Fig. 3.
Clearly the 2 °C s−1 heating rate produces more O2 at a given temperature than the 16 °C s−1 rate, which is likely due to a transport limitation within the reactive structure. However, the nanostructured ferrite performance is comparable to that of CeO2 which, unlike iron oxide, is known to possess high oxygen ion conductivity and rapid exchange kinetics. Therefore it is conceivable that by reducing the thickness of the Al2O3 skeletal structure, diffusion limitations may be further mitigated allowing greater utilization of the redox active Fe cation and faster redox kinetics.
To support our hypothesis that the reactions embodied by eqn (1) and (2) are correct, we analysed the chemical composition of the nanostructured materials using surface Raman spectroscopy. Several representative samples were oxidized in either O2 or CO2, or reduced in pure helium, and then thermally quenched before ex situ examination with a Raman microscope. Presented in Fig. 4 are Raman spectra for three of our endpoint compounds, CoFe2O4, CoAl2O4, and FeAl2O4, along with spectra measured from samples taken at various states of oxidation (labelled (a)–(c) in the figure). Material fully oxidized in O2 (c) exhibits spectral features indicative of CoFe2O4, with two main excitation peaks observed at 476 and 686 cm−1 which agrees with literature assignments for this compound.29–31 Raman spectra for material in the fully reduced state (a) show a mixture of phonon modes that can be attributed to cobalt aluminate32 and hercynite.33 Furthermore, the strong resonance features of CoFe2O4 are not detectable in (a) indicating that the reduction reaction has gone to completion in the near surface region of the ferrite. Also of note is the relative stability of the reduced compound (FeAl2O4) in air at room temperature. Samples were removed from the reactor and stored for several days before transport to the Raman microscope without special handling to avoid air exposure.

CO2 oxidation
The observation that the oxygen exchange behaviour appears to be thermodynamically favourable and kinetically feasible at conditions typically found in solar thermal reactors is necessary but not sufficient to establish suitability of a reactive structure for use in CO2 splitting. In fact, additional thermodynamic constraints, kinetic limitations, or undesirable reactions with carbon may preclude use of a particular material chemistry. Presented in Fig. 5 is the temporal behaviour of the CO production rate measured during CO2 oxidation at 1000 °C and 600 Torr pressure for two different thermal reduction states. As expected, the amount of CO produced (area under the curves in Fig. 5) is dependent on the thermal reduction temperature because this establishes the initial amount of Fe2+ (Fe2Al2O4) formed in the first step of the redox cycle (see inset Fig. 3). It also appears that the CO2 oxidation kinetics are somewhat slower than the O2 oxidation kinetics, as evidenced by the time required to achieve full oxidation. The reaction is not complete after 450 s of CO2 exposure because the CO signal does not return to baseline. Admittedly a more thorough investigation of this behaviour is required because the O2 oxidation data in Fig. 3 are confounded by a non-isothermal, non-linear temperature profile making a direct comparison more challenging.
 Fig. 5  Production rate of CO as a function of time measured for the nano-engineered CoFe2O4-coated Al2O3 material oxidized in 50 vol.% CO2 at 1000 °C, a reactor pressure of 600 Torr, and a thermal reduction temperature (TR) of 1460 °C (top curve) or 1360 °C (bottom curve). The solid curves through the raw data are derived from smoothed interpolating splines. CO production rates are normalized to the total mass of material. 
Surface Raman spectra presented in Fig. 4 support the notion of incomplete oxidation by CO2 at reaction times less than 500 s. The curve labelled (b) appears to possess features of all three end point compositions. A detailed principal component analysis is underway to rigorously validate this hypothesis and preclude the possibility that additional compounds are being formed. Our experimental results also suggest that CO2 splitting may be kinetically limited at the surface; increasing the reactor pressure from 75 to 600 Torr has a similar effect on the CO production rate as increasing the thermal reduction temperature from 1360 °C to 1460 °C (data not shown).
Conclusion
Currently, we are investigating the role of cobalt and like-type cations in this redox chemistry because hercynite cannot be decomposed into Fe3O4 under these operating conditions.34 Furthermore, the effects of CoFe2O4 film thickness and Al2O3 wall thickness are not well understood meaning that a more optimized nano-engineered structure may be accessible because ALD enables atomistic control of the synthesis process. Further lowering the thermal reduction temperature and improving both the oxidation kinetics and iron utilization are possible.
Although there is much more to be learned about this intriguing redox cycle, this paper demonstrates the efficacy of a completely different approach to two-step thermochemical CO2 splitting by blending novel chemistry with a nano-engineered reactive structure. We demonstrate that our CoFe2O4-coated Al2O3 material is capable of producing appreciable amounts of CO after thermal reduction at a temperature as low as 1360 °C, with consistent oxidation behaviour up to 23 thermal reductions. This observation is approximately 100 °C to 150 °C lower than values reported for ferrite35 or CeO27,13 based systems, respectively. Finally, adding compound-forming redox chemistries to the list of possible candidate material systems opens up new opportunities for discovery of better and more viable metal-oxide based redox cycles for producing fuels from concentrated sunlight.
Experimental method
A high surface area support was synthesized by depositing Al2O3 onto a porous poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) (PS-DVB) particle template via atomic layer deposition (ALD). The PS-DVB template was burned away in air during calcination giving rise to a 15 nm thick skeletal Al2O3 structure consisting of a wide distribution of both mesopores and macropores, as described elsewhere.36 A nanometer-thick film of stoichiometric cobalt ferrite spinel (CoFe2O4) was applied to the porous Al2O3 support via a similar ALD process,37 and the structure was thermally cycled as prepared. The cobalt ferrite loading determined by ICP-AES analysis was 20% by mass.
Samples were reduced and oxidized in a stagnation flow reactor (SFR) equipped with a modulated effusive beam mass spectrometer and laser-based sample heater.38 In stagnation flow, the gas-phase region above the sample between the centerline and the reactor wall can be considered an ideal one-dimensional stagnation plane governed by diffusive transport. Samples were placed in a loosely packed shallow bed within the stagnation plane allowing gases to access all exposed surfaces within a well-mixed control volume.
Approximately 80 mg of CoFe2O4-coated Al2O3 were placed in the SFR. Typical operating conditions were either 75 or 600 Torr total pressure, a gas flow rate of 500 sccm consisting of either pure helium, a mixture of 0.2 vol.% O2 in helium, or a mixture of 50 vol.% CO2 in helium depending on the experiment. During thermal reduction, samples were held at a baseline temperature of 1000 °C, maintained by a laboratory furnace, and heated to a temperature between 1300 and 1460 °C using a 500 W CW near-IR diode laser in a pure helium flow. The laser was focused onto a 2.9 cm2 area providing an equivalent solar concentration of approximately 1700 suns at full power, albeit at discrete wavelengths as opposed to a solar spectrum. Typical heating rates were 16 °C s−1, which closely mimic the thermal environment expected in a concentrated solar power application. Samples were oxidized with either CO2 or O2 at 1000 °C. Temperature was measured with an optical pyrometer that is accurate to ±25 °C. The gas composition of the reactor effluent was determined by measuring the partial pressure of O2, CO, and CO2 using a mass spectrometer.
Characterization method
Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was used to determine cobalt and iron mass loading of the material. A Raman microscope was used to investigate phonon modes in the films to fingerprint the chemical structure of the deposits after heat treatment in helium, oxygen, or carbon dioxide. Spectra were acquired ex situ in a 180° backscattering geometry using a 100× objective lens and 532 nm excitation from a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser. A Semrock edge filter was used to reject the elastically scattered light. A spectrograph with a single 1200 grooves per mm grating dispersed the light onto a CCD detector cooled by liquid nitrogen. The laser has a spot size of approximately 1 μm and the spectrometer was calibrated with a neon lamp.

Broader context
Solar thermochemical splitting of CO2 into CO and O2 to produce a sustainable fuel is an attractive method to reduce the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The prototypical two step CO2 splitting process uses an iron oxide based thermochemical cycle. However, thermal instability of the iron oxide based material, i.e. the formation of a molten/slag phase upon repeated thermal cycling, leads to loss of activity. In this communication, we discuss the application of “hercynite” redox chemistry in a nano-engineered structure for the high temperature solar thermochemical carbon dioxide splitting process. The oxygen uptake/release capacity of the active material is consistent from cycle to cycle indicating that the activity is not affected by loss of internal surface area. Furthermore, the active material can be thermally reduced to a sufficient extent at temperatures that are ∼150 °C lower than the traditional iron oxide based cycle.

 	Fig. 2  Optical image showing 0.5 mm diameter spheroids of porous Al2O3 shells coated in nanometer thick CoFe2O4. Colour changes from brown to green when hercynite forms upon thermal reduction (top). FESEM image of the porous Al2O3 structure prepared by ALD (bottom left). Schematic illustrating the conceptual layout of the nano-engineered reactive structure, not drawn to scale, and the spinel compound that forms upon calcination (bottom right). A representative FESEM image of the skeletal structure is incorporated into the schematic. The coverage of CoFe2O4 on the alumina scaffold is not limited to the outer surface; it coats all gas-accessible surfaces on and within the porous structure (see text).	 

 	Fig. 3  Oxygen uptake and release behaviour as a function of time and temperature measured in the presence of a constant 2000 ppm O2 background partial pressure indicates that thermodynamics for hercynite reduction are favourable for solar-driven thermochemical cycles (see text). The reduction extent as a function of temperature for ceria and hercynite at two different heating rates is shown in the inset.	 

 	Fig. 4  Surface Raman spectra recorded for ferrite and aluminate reference materials compared to unknown compositions of nano-engineered CoFe2O4-coated Al2O3 material prepared by thermal reduction in helium (a), or oxidation in CO2 (b), or oxidation in O2 (c).	 

 	Fig. 5  Production rate of CO as a function of time measured for the nano-engineered CoFe2O4-coated Al2O3 material oxidized in 50 vol.% CO2 at 1000 °C, a reactor pressure of 600 Torr, and a thermal reduction temperature (TR) of 1460 °C (top curve) or 1360 °C (bottom curve). The solid curves through the raw data are derived from smoothed interpolating splines. CO production rates are normalized to the total mass of material.
