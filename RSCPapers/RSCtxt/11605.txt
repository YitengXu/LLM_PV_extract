However, it is unclear to what extent this class of tandems would outperform single-junction solar cells under realistic operating conditions in the field. In this paper we model the annual energy-yield of tandems with polycrystalline II–VI top cells with different band gap pairs and architectures under changing illumination spectra in different climates. We find that both two-terminal, high-band gap II–VI/CIGS and four-terminal CdTe/CIGS tandems offer energy-yield advantages in all climates commensurate with their AM1.5G efficiency improvements, up to [38%] relative. On the other hand, a two-terminal CdTe/GaSb tandem cell has only an [11%] annual energy-yield advantage in humid climate, because infrared light absorption due to atmospheric water vapor limits the bottom-cell contribution. In addition to narrowing the scope of future II–VI-based tandem R&D efforts, our methodology to rapidly assess tandem energy-yield should be easily generalizable to other material combinations.

Broader context
Tandem solar cells – i.e., solar cells consisting of not one but two or more cells stacked on top of each other – currently experience a renaissance in the academic research literature. Higher conversion efficiencies promised by tandems not only theoretically surpass single-junction cell limits, but also promise lower cost of energy. Assessment of the cost of solar energy however is a two-part problem, that of calculating the module manufacturing cost and that of calculating the actual energy yield of a solar cell – single junction or tandem – in real-world climate conditions. In this paper, MIT's PV Research Laboratory and First Solar's Performance Prediction and Development Engineering teams have teamed up to predictively answer the latter question, which is the more technically demanding of these two.

Introduction
In photovoltaic modules and installations, sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency is one of the strongest technical levers to lower cost and capital expense. The efficiencies of single-junction (1J) PV devices will plateau as they approach a fundamental physical asymptote, the Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit (SQL). The tandem approach, stacking two or more absorber materials with complementary band gaps, can exceed the SQL of 1J devices. An open question is whether tandems will be cost competitive with best-in-class industrial 1J devices. This is a two-part question involving a cost calculation and an energy-yield calculation, both of which are currently lacking.
Herein, we address the question of energy-yield of dual-junction (2J) polycrystalline tandem solar cells. We study tandems with at least one mature sub-cell technology to direct this work towards a relevant, near-to-medium-term commercialization horizon. Prior work has been focused on tandems generalized on just the absorber band gap without considering the actual device stack.1,2 We introduce a simple, but powerful, framework to predict tandem energy-yield, consisting of a semi-empirical efficiency model coupled to easily accessible clear-sky solar spectra and ambient temperature. This model has simplicity and speed advantages over previous models, based on numerical device physics simulators,3–5 without sacrificing accuracy. Our approach also stands in contrast with previous semi-empirical models, which require the tandem solar cells to be developed and fully characterized before energy-yield prediction can be made.6,7 We model realistic combinations of industrially relevant thin-film materials including those at gigawatt-scale annual manufacturing capacities (cadmium telluride and copper indium gallium dichalcogenide), which have demonstrated high 1J efficiencies. We find that for flat-panel configuration, the annual energy-yield (kW h per m2 of cell area per year) of tandems varies by [30%] relative depending on the selection of band gaps and geographical location. An unexpected finding is the sensitivity of low-band gap materials to broad H2O absorption lines in the infrared solar spectrum, which reduces the output of tandems comprising low-band gap bottom-cell absorbers in humid environments. This flexible energy-yield calculation framework, in combination with future manufacturing cost estimates, should increase visibility into the financial advantage, if any, of tandems over 1J solar cells.
Methodology and results
In this section we present a streamlined, accurate, physics-based selection process for sub-cell materials in tandem solar cells: we first map the theoretical, generalized SQL efficiency limits for tandem cells as a function of top and bottom sub-cells' band gap energies Eg (Model 1). We then identify three different band gap combinations for two-terminal (2T) and four-terminal (4T) tandems; those combinations both promise near-optimum theoretical efficiency and have at least one sub-cell built from an industrial, mature thin-film technology. For each of the three architectures we model the sensitivity of efficiency limits as a function of achievable sub-cell quality, as expressed by the sub-cell open-circuit voltage Voc (Model 2). The focus of this paper lies on a newly developed, accurate, physics-based, and high-speed assessment model for the annual tandem energy-yield using hourly climate spectra in different locations (Model 3).
Model 1: radiatively limited STC efficiency & architecture selection
We first calculate the theoretical SQL efficiency limits for 2J tandem cells using the standard one-diode approach (details in Electronic Supplementary Information).8–10 The resulting efficiency-limit maps (Fig. 1) for 2T and 4T tandems are used for the selection of appropriate tandem band gap pairs. The Eg range for optimum efficiency of 44–45% is much narrower for 2T architectures (Fig. 1a) than for 4T architectures (Fig. 1b) due to the constraint of current-density (J) matching in series-connected 2T architectures.
 Fig. 1  Radiative STC efficiency model (2J radiatively-limited efficiency) for (a) series-connected monolithic 2T tandem and (b) mechanically-stacked 4T tandem solar cells. In the 4T architecture, for Eg,top < Eg,bot, there is no contribution from the bottom cell. The band gap of CdTe, GaSb, CIGS, and high-Eg II–VI are marked with white dashed lines while Architecture A, B, and C are marked using with white circle marks. 
For the analysis in this paper, we choose three distinctly different tandem architectures using two constraints: (1) the respective Eg pair lies in a high-efficiency region of >40% in Fig. 1; (2) one of the two sub-cells is based on an industrially-mature thin-film technology, CdTe or CIGS. The three selected tandem architectures are summarized in Table 1.

We now discuss material selection for each architecture in detail. For Architecture A, the mature CdTe top cell material must be coupled with a bottom-cell material with band gap Eg,bot of around 0.70 eV, based on the analysis for 2T tandems in Fig. 1a. Possible candidates include GaSb, InGaAs, and CdHgTe (Table 2). Single-crystal GaSb with Eg = 0.73 eV as part of a 4T tandem with GaAs has previously been shown to achieve an efficiency of over 35% under concentration.11 GaSb is also interesting because a polycrystalline GaSb solar cell epitaxially grown on a polycrystalline GaSb substrate has reportedly achieved a conversion efficiency similar to that of a GaSb solar cell epitaxially grown on a single-crystal GaSb substrate.12,13 Furthermore, defect-free, lattice-matched growth of GaSb on ZnTe, the back contact material for industrial CdTe solar cells, has previously been shown.14 With substantial R&D efforts, it might be possible to grow an efficient polycrystalline GaSb solar cell on the back of a CdTe solar cell and enable Architecture A.

For the 2T-tandem Architecture B, we combine the well-established polycrystalline material CIGS as bottom cell with a higher-Eg II–VI thin-film top cell (Table 1). Based on Fig. 1a, the appropriate Eg,top for this bottom cell is centered around 1.68 eV. Historically, approaches to make higher Eg thin-film cells from CdTe alloys (such as CdZnTe, CdMgTe, and CdMnTe, Table 2) have failed largely because the alloyed metal atoms (Zn, Mg, Mn) diffuse out of the film during the grain boundary passivation step using CdCl2, resulting in low-quality thin-film solar cells with Voc much lower than desired.18–20 Nevertheless, it is possible that one can make a good high-Eg polycrystalline thin-film Cd(Zn,Mg,Mn)Te top cell if a substitute for the grain boundary passivation step using CdCl2 is found. We note that good single-crystal 1J CdZnTe solar cells have previously been shown (Voc = 1.34 V and 1.21 V for Eg = 1.82 eV and 1.66 eV)16 although the authors report that the reproducibility of the work has been difficult to achieve.21 We also note that polycrystalline CdSe (Eg = 1.67 eV) thin-film solar cells have previously been developed although the Voc is typically still very low (Voc = 700 mV, Jsc = 21 mA cm−2 for 100 mW cm−2 illumination).22 It has been proposed that polycrystalline thin-film CdSe solar cells can be used as a candidate II–VI top cell in lieu of a high-Eg polycrystalline CdTe alloy solar cell if challenges associated with its low Voc can be overcome.23 To enable this architecture, R&D efforts have to be focused on enabling the growth of high efficiency 1J high-Eg II–VI solar cell, and eventually on the cell's integration with the CIGS bottom cell.
The development of both Architectures A and B requires significant technological innovation. In addition to the discussed R&D requirements for low-Eg bottom cells (A) and high-Eg top cells (B), uniform, large-area polycrystalline tunnel junctions, J-mismatch due to parasitic absorption in layers across the sub-cells and non-perfect anti-reflection optics, and material processing compatibility represent some of the device-level challenges which have to be overcome.
The third Architecture C is a 4T polycrystalline thin-film tandem with mature CdTe as the top cell and mature CIGS as the bottom cell (Table 1). The SQL efficiency limit for this tandem is 42.4%, only 3% below the absolute 4T efficiency maximum of 45.1%. Polycrystalline CdTe/CIS 4T thin-film tandems have been demonstrated as early as 1988, with the best CdTe/CIS 4T tandem so far reaching 15.3% when a 13.9% CdTe top cell is used.9,10 Because of the Eg pair flexibility offered by the 4T architecture,11 a series of tandems with varying material and Eg pairs have been discussed in the literature, ranging from 15.3% (1 Sun) to 35.8% (240 × AM0 illumination).11,24–30
Architecture C allows both sub-cells to be fabricated separately, using manufacturing techniques optimized for each material – superstrate architecture for CdTe and substrate architecture for CIGS – before they are integrated into a 4T tandem module. This also enables the polycrystalline CdTe/CIGS tandem module to be made using two pieces of glass. The primary R&D challenge for this architecture is the selection of an infrared-transparent back contact material for the CdTe top cell.
Model 2: semi-empirical STC efficiency limit
We next model the tandem STC efficiency limit with non-radiative recombination, but ideal optical components, ideal internal resistance values, and a unity ideality factor (Fig. 2). This model provides guidance on minimum sub-cell Voc,1Sun values needed to achieve certain tandem efficiencies – without performing complex device physics simulations. This enables both rapid screening of different tandem architectures and quantitatively evaluating the impact of R&D to increase 1J sub-cell Voc,1Sun values on tandem efficiency entitlements.
 Fig. 2  Semi-empirical STC efficiency model for 2J tandems with varying level of recombination mechanisms in the sub-cells for Architecture (a) A, (b) B, and (c) C. Voc,1Sun's for (i) polycrystalline CdTe,32 (ii) single-crystal GaSb,11 (iii) polycrystalline GaSb grown below CdTe (assumed), (iv) high-Eg II–VI (assumed), (v) polycrystalline CIGS,33 and (vi) polycrystalline CIGS grown below high-Eg II–VI (assumed) solar cells are marked with dashed lines. (d) Ideality factor of n = 1 is used in (a–c). For real thin-film solar cell with n > 1, there will be a slight decrease in FF and STC efficiency. As an example, Architecture B with n = 1.5 is shown for comparison with (b). 
We thus extend the radiative efficiency Model 1 to the semi-empirical efficiency Model 2 by replacing the radiative dark current J0,SQ (see ESI†) with Jdark (V) = J0(exp(qV/nkT) − 1)(1)where J0 represents the dark current corresponding to recombination mechanisms and n is the diode ideality factor, similar to a previous analysis for 1J cells.31 We then convert dark current J0 to sub-cell Voc under AM1.5G illumination (Voc,1Sun) using the formula: Voc,1Sun = (nkT/q)ln(Jsc/J0 + 1)(2)Fig. 2a shows the results for Architecture A. Experimentally demonstrated 1J Voc,1Sun values are shown as dotted horizontal and vertical lines. We show voltages for a non-Eg-graded polycrystalline CdTe cell with Voc,1Sun = 0.857 V32 (dotted line (i)) and single-crystal GaSb cell with Voc,1Sun = 0.37 V11 (dotted line (ii)); the resulting tandem efficiency limit is consequently only 29.5%, instead of its 42.6% SQL-efficiency limit. We recognize that polycrystalline GaSb sub-cell grown on the bottom of CdTe will likely have lower Voc,1Sun. If the polycrystalline bottom GaSb cell has Voc,1Sun = 0.3 V instead (dotted line (iii), we use this more realistic value in the energy-yield Model 3), the tandem efficiency limit is 27.5%.

Fig. 2b shows the STC efficiency limits for Architecture B. Solar Frontier's published CIGS solar cell with ∼1.05 eV bandgap and Voc,1Sun = 0.686 V33 is inserted as horizontal dotted line (v). Mature high-efficiency polycrystalline top cells with Eg ∼ 1.68 eV have not yet been demonstrated, but the model shows that an efficient high-Eg polycrystalline II–VI top cell with Voc = 1.0 V (dotted line (iv)) would allow a tandem STC efficiency entitlement of 33.2%. It is likely that the Voc,1Sun of a CIGS sub-cell grown on the bottom of high-Eg II–VI material will be lower; if we therefore assume Voc,1Sun = 0.58 V (dotted line (vi), used in the energy-yield Model 3 for Architecture B), the tandem efficiency will be limited to only 30.9%. In addition, in Fig. 2d, we show that a non-ideal ideality factor n = 1.5 (as often is the case for thin-film solar cells1) in Architecture B decreases the efficiency entitlement by about 2% absolute (compared to the ideal n = 1 case in Fig. 2b) over the Voc,1Sun range of interest.

Fig. 2c shows Model 2 results for the 4T Architecture C. Because the sub-cells are fabricated independently, we assume here that the sub-cells maintain their experimental 1J Voc,1Sun values (0.857 V for CdTe and 0.686 V for CIGS). For this 4T tandem, an STC efficiency limit of 31.1% is possible using currently available sub-cells (dotted lines (i) and (v) in Fig. 2c).
It is interesting to note that the 4T iso-efficiency curve slopes are no longer close to unity as in the 2T case because now the majority of the current is generated within the top cell. In the 2T architecture, Voc,1Sun degradation on either the top or the bottom cell will have similar effect on the tandem STC efficiency because both sub-cells are J-matched. For the 4T tandem of Architecture C, this is not true. The bottom cell has lower J, and hence the degradation of Voc,1Sun on the bottom cell is less significant than the same Voc,1Sun degradation in the top cell. The lower sensitivity of the efficiency of 4T architectures to bottom cell Voc,1Sun means there is potentially more flexibility on the usage of lower-efficiency bottom cells in exchange for lower bottom cell fabrication cost. This is advantageous when expertise on low-cost, high-efficiency CdTe top cell fabrication is already pre-existing and expertise on the bottom cell fabrication needs to be developed.
We summarize the efficiency entitlements ηmax of the three tandem architectures in Table 3 for Models 1 and 2. The radiatively limited SQL efficiencies (Model 1) for the three architectures lie close together at 42.4–43.9%. Tandem cells that are limited by their sub-cells' Voc,1Sun (Model 2), have significantly lower efficiency entitlements, and the efficiencies are also spread further apart (27.5–31.1%).

Model 3: semi-empirical annual energy-yield
The cost of solar energy is determined by the annual energy-yield in a given location, rather than the solar module's STC efficiency. We therefore introduce here an energy-yield model for realistic tandem devices. This simple framework allows the prediction of tandem performance in different climate spectra, using easily accessible clear-sky solar spectra and ambient temperature. The calculations performed using this model are simple and fast. We first validated our energy-yield model by constructing GaAs/silicon tandem solar cell architectures corresponding to previously published models.3 Under identical device structures and spectral conditions, our models showed at most [2%] relative error compared to a far more complex physics-based models, making it a suitable tool to screen and predict the energy-yield of different tandem solar cell architectures (see Electronic Supplementary Information).3 We model the annual energy-yield for the previously selected Architectures A, B, C (Table 1) in units of kW h per unit cell area (m2) per year. In the following we describe the cell and spectrum models and then discuss the energy-yield results for three different climate spectra.
For Model 3 we relax the assumption of ideal optical components, and we also incorporate the effect of internal cell resistances. External quantum efficiency EQE(λ) for each sub-cell is calculated using a transfer matrix method (TMM) simulation34 and previously published refractive indices34–39 assuming that carrier collection efficiency is unity (see ESI†). This simplification is justified for high-efficiency direct-band gap thin-film solar cells because almost all of the photo-generated carriers, generated close to the junction, get collected. We also use the experimental 1J sub-cell Voc,1Sun parameters used in Model 2 for the electrical model (Table 4). Internal series and shunt resistance values Rs and Rsh of sub-cells are fitted and extracted from the literature and summarized in Table 4.33,40,41
Table 4 Polycrystalline device parameters used in both efficiency and energy-yield models. The Rs and Rsh for CdTe and CIGS cells are taken from published First Solar and Solar Frontier's CdTe cell J–V curves respectively.33,40 Because a J–V curve for a good high-Eg II–VI solar cell for Architecture B is not available, we have assumed the same Rs and Rsh values as for CdTe. Likewise, good GaSb J–V curves are only available under high light concentration,11 so we have chosen to extract Rs and Rsh from a high-quality GaAs solar cell (Alta Devices) to substitute for the GaSb solar cell's Rs and Rsh instead.41 This is an optimistic scenario because it is unlikely that a polycrystalline GaSb cell deposited on the bottom of CdTe sub-cell can have resistance parameters equivalent to single-crystal GaAs cell epitaxially grown on single-crystal GaAs wafer

The annual hourly spectral component for this energy-yield calculation is obtained using the “Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine” (SMARTS) from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).42 We decided to use this clear-sky model, because the effect of cloud coverage would be very specific to each region and has similar relative impact on energy-yield of both 2J tandems and 1J reference cells. We choose three geographically and meteorologically distinct climates – dry (Albuquerque, NM), temperate (Rapid City, SD), and humid (Miami, FL). For each location, a south facing plane with irradiance-optimized tilt is chosen. The tilt angles from horizontal surface for Albuquerque, Rapid City, and Miami are 29.7°, 37.0°, and 24.5°, respectively. Typical Meteorological Year 3 (TMY3) files from the National Solar Radiation Data Base (NSRDB) are available at each location.43 These are used as inputs (atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature, relative humidity, daily average temperature, and precipitable water) into the SMARTS model. As one simplification, we keep the cell temperature constant at Tcell = 25 °C in this analysis of the 2T tandems; in reality differential temperature coefficients will induce additional J-mismatch in the 2T architecture. For Architecture C, we compare the effect of non-constant temperature as discussed below. As a second simplification, we do not consider any losses between cell and module, and between module and power plant substation or transformer.
Using these assumptions, we calculate the sub-cells' J–V curves for the 2T and 4T tandems and obtain the hourly power generation, which is integrated throughout the year to obtain the annual energy-yield (kW h m−2 year−1). As benchmark we use a non-band gap-graded 1J CdTe cell model, with the same material properties as the top cells in Architectures A and C, with an STC efficiency of 18.6% (Tables 3 and 4).
We first calculate the annual energy-yield of Architecture A and compare to that of the 1J CdTe benchmark cell. For the tandem cell in Architecture A, we use indium tin oxide (ITO) as front transparent-conducting oxide (TCO) instead of the typically used fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). The higher infrared transmission of ITO both increases the bottom cell Jsc and reduces the Jsc-mismatch between the sub-cells from 5 mA cm−2 to 2.2 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3). The modeled STC efficiency of this 2T tandem is 23.1%, which is a [24%] relative increase from the STC efficiency of the 1J CdTe reference cell (Table 3). The annual energy-yield of Architecture A in a dry climate is [22%, 107 kW h m−2 year−1] relative higher than the benchmark 1J CdTe cell (Fig. 4a). However, the energy-yield advantage is severely reduced in the humid climate, where Architecture A only yields an [11%, 55 kW h m−2 year−1] energy-yield advantage relative to the 1J CdTe cell. This effect will be discussed in detail below, referencing Fig. 4b. The open symbols pertain to a hypothetical three-terminal (3T) tandem device that is also discussed in the same context below. We also note that the annual solar insolation at Rapid City, SD (44.1° N) is lower than the annual solar insolation at Albuquerque, NM (35.1° N) and Miami, FL (25.7° N), which explains the lower overall energy-yield for the temperate climate example.
 Fig. 3  TCO selection for Architecture A. (a) When FTO is used, there is a large infrared photon loss and consequently large Jsc-mismatch of 5 mA cm−2 (under AM1.5G) between the sub-cells due to infrared light reflection off the FTO–CdTe interface and FTO parasitic absorption, as simulated by TMM simulation. (b) Replacing FTO with ITO reduces infrared light reflection and parasitic absorption in the TCO layer, resulting in a lower Jsc-mismatch of 2.2 mA cm−2 (under AM1.5G). 
 Fig. 4  (a) Semi-empirical annual energy-yield model for a 2T CdTe/GaSb tandem cell (Architecture A in the text) for dry (Albuquerque), temperate (Rapid City) and humid (Miami) climate. The symbols for 3T represent the energy-yield of an imaginary tandem with identical device layer stack but with independent maximum power point tracking of the two sub-cells. Loss mechanism (i) originates from a slight J-mismatch due to imperfect optics. Loss mechanism (ii) originates from additional J-mismatch due to atmospheric water vapor that mutes the bottom cell contribution. Tcell = 25 °C is assumed. (b) Spectral density of Jeq for AM1.5G spectrum, defined as the spectral density of Jsc which can be generated by a solar cell with perfect EQE(λ) throughout the entire AM1.5G spectrum range. H2O vapor absorption band in the atmosphere are indicated, as well as the spectral response range for high-Eg II–VI, CdTe, CIGS, and GaSb used in this model. 
Next we calculate the annual energy-yield of Architecture B. Fig. 5a shows the device model for this tandem's architecture. Because the spectral response of the bottom sub-cells of Architectures B and C only extends to λ = 1240 nm, we choose standard FTO as the front TCO for both architectures. Model 3 provides the STC efficiency for Architecture B at 25.6%, which is a [38%] increase relative to the 1J CdTe model. The annual energy-yield for Architecture B, shown in Fig. 5a, is [33%, 162 kW h m−2 year−1] relative higher in the dry climate, and [25%, 123 kW h m−2 year−1] relative higher in the humid climate compared to the 1J CdTe cell (Fig. 5a). The discussion of the open symbols is found in the discussion section below.
 Fig. 5  (a) Semi-empirical annual energy-yield model for a 2T high-Eg II–VI/CIGS tandem (architecture B in the text). For the explanation of the 3T symbols see caption to Fig. 4. No reliance on λ > 1250 nm light and the usage of tunable EG II–VI top cell enables significant reduction in J-mismatch due to imperfect optics (i) for the dry climate, even when FTO is used. In humid climate, the J-mismatch loss is only slightly higher due to additional infrared spectrum suppression by atmospheric water vapor absorption (ii). Tcell = 25 °C is assumed. (b) Semi-empirical annual energy-yield model for a 4T CdTe/CIGS tandem (architecture C in the text). There is no J-mismatch loss in this configuration. In this model we also study the effect of cell operating temperature under illumination (data points denoted with T). The effect of power loss due to temperature (iii) can be calculated for 4T and 1J architectures (Tcell = 25 °C for filled points, simulated operating temperature for half-emptied points). Rs and Rsh used in this model are identical to those used in Fig. 4a and 5a. 
For the annual energy-yield calculation of the 4T tandem Architecture C, we design the optical stack by including ITO antireflective electrodes and an optically thick ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulation layer between the two cells, as shown in the Fig. 5b. The respective interlayer ITO thicknesses are chosen to maximize the Jsc generated in the bottom cell. The technologies for the respective cells in this tandem pair are relatively mature, so we assume the same Voc,1Sun values as for published best-in-class superstrate-CdTe and substrate-CIGS cells (Table 4).32,33 This leads to an STC efficiency of 26.0% for Architecture C, a [40%] increase relative to that of the benchmark 1J CdTe cell. The annual energy-yield production is [38%, 184 kW h m−2 year−1] and [33%, 159 kW h m−2 year−1] larger than the 1J CdTe cell in the dry and the humid climate, respectively (Fig. 5b). Table 5 summarizes the three tandems' energy-yield advantages with regard to CdTe at Tcell = 25 °C.

Model 3 extension: inclusion of cell operating temperature
To demonstrate the impact of a realistic operating cell temperature, Tcell, we calculate here the energy-yield of Architecture C using Model 3. Tcell is calculated using the formula:44 Tcell = Tamb + Geffα(1 − ε)/Uc(3)where Tamb is the ambient temperature recorded in the NREL SMARTS model's TMY3 file, Geff is the hourly irradiance, α is the cell absorption coefficient assumed to be 0.9, ε is the STC efficiency, and Uc is a user-defined parameter assumed to be 30.7.44 The power at elevated temperature P(Tcell) is calculated using the published temperature coefficients Tc of −0.25%/K for CdTe45 and −0.31%/K for CIGS46 modules using the formula: P(Tcell) = PSTC(1 + Tc(Tcell − TSTC))(4)Fig. 5b shows the results of this model. The relative impact of Tamb on the energy-yield is slightly smaller for the tandem compared to the 1J CdTe cell. In a cold location like Rapid City, energy-yield loss due to temperature (mechanism (iii) in Fig. 5b) decreases from [1.5%, 6.7 kW h m−2 year−1] relative for 1J to [1.0%, 6.5 kW h m−2 year−1] relative for 4T. The drop is smaller for a hot location like Miami, which only decreases from [4.6%, 22.5 kW h m−2 year−1] relative for 1J to [4.5%, 28.9 kW h m−2 year−1] relative for 4T. By intuition, the 4T CdTe/CIGS tandem should be more sensitive to the increase in Tamb compared to the 1J CdTe cell because the average Tc of a 4T tandem is larger than that of a 1J CdTe cell (Tc of CIGS cell is larger than CdTe because CIGS' Eg is smaller). However, the power contribution from the bottom cell in a tandem is much smaller than the power contribution of the top cell so power loss from the bottom cell due to Tamb increase is much less significant. After taking into account the increase in 4T tandem cell efficiency compared to the 1J cell (correspondingly, reduced Tcell for 4T tandem compared to 1J CdTe), the 4T CdTe/CIGS tandem is actually less affected by the increase in Tamb compared to the 1J CdTe cell. We note that an extensive device physics simulation is necessary to investigate the impact of non-standard Tcell on the 2T tandems, which is not conducted here; this is because our model does not incorporate the change of sub-cells' J–V curve shape with respect to Tcell. Incorporating this change will be necessary to calculate the J–V curve of 2T tandem under varying Tcell, and it represents a limitation to our current modeling methodology.
Discussion of the energy-yield results
Architecture A has the lowest energy-yield advantage relative to a 1J CdTe cell (488 kW h m−2 year−1 baseline). This is especially the case in the humid climate, where the energy-yield advantage relative to 1J CdTe is only [11%, 55 kW h m−2 year−1], compared to [22%, 107 kW h m−2 year−1] in the dry climate. This poorer energy-yield in humid climate is caused by J mismatch in the tandem, which is explained in Fig. 4b: the spectral density of AM1.5G spectrum's “equivalent current density” (Jeq density, defined in the caption of Fig. 4b) shows deep absorption bands associated with atmospheric water vapor.47,48 The absorption bands at λ = 940, 1120, and 1400 nm are significant because they affect the GaSb bottom cell whose spectral response extends from 850–1750 nm in tandem Architecture A. The humid climate spectrum of Miami has thus less infrared photons in this IR spectrum range compared to the dry climate spectrum of Albuquerque, resulting in relative drop of Jsc within the bottom cell. Due to the J-matching constraint, discussed in the context of the SQL efficiency in Model 1, this J drop is propagated throughout the tandem and significantly reduces the 2T energy-yield. As a didactic tool, we quantify the J-mismatch loss by modeling the hypothetical tandem cell's output for sub-cells that are operated independently, without any constraint of J-matching (3T empty blue triangles in Fig. 4a). For this tandem, for which power calculation is performed in the same way as with a 4T device, the relative energy-yield advantage versus the 1J CdTe benchmark improves to [25%, 120 kW h m−2 year−1] in the humid climate, and [28%, 136 kW h m−2 year−1] in the dry climate, which is significantly higher than in the 2T case. We also note that the observed [5%, 29 kW h m−2 year−1] relative energy-yield loss between the 3T and 2T tandems in the dry climate is caused by a small J-mismatch caused by imperfect optics of the thin-film tandem stack (mechanism (i) in Fig. 4a). On the other hand, the relatively larger energy-yield loss of [11%, 65 kW h m−2 year−1] between the 3T and 2T tandems in the humid climate is a result of both optical (mechanism (i)) and atmospheric water vapor absorption (mechanism (ii)).
Compared to Architecture A, Architecture B is significantly less dependent on the availability of infrared light because the spectral response of this tandem only extends to λ = 1240 nm (see indicated absorption region for CIGS bottom cell in Fig. 4b). The annual energy-yield advantage of Architecture B relative to the 1J CdTe cell is [33%, 162 kW h m−2 year−1] and [25%, 123 kW h m−2 year−1] in the dry and humid climates, respectively. Architecture C, which does not have any J-matching constraint, has an energy-yield advantage of [38%, 184 kW h m−2 year−1] and [33%, 159 kW h m−2 year−1] over the 1J CdTe for the dry and the humid climates, respectively. These are the highest among the three architectures being considered as the loss mechanisms (i) is absent in 4T tandems with independent sub-cell MPP tracking, while loss mechanism (ii) is greatly suppressed in a 4T CdTe/CIGS tandem because CIGS has larger Eg than GaSb.
The conclusion about these three tandem architectures with different Eg pairs and configurations can easily be extended toward other novel tandem architectures intended for terrestrial applications. For example, perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells in either 4T or 2T configurations.26,49–52 The Eg of the silicon bottom cell is 1.12 eV, which is higher than the Eg of CIGS bottom cells (1.04 eV) used in Architecture B and C. Consequently, neither 4T nor J-matched 2T perovskite/silicon tandem will suffer from infrared suppression by water vapor absorption in the atmosphere, even in humid locations. Instead, it is important to focus on cost modeling and reliability work to commercially enable perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Some other tandem approaches focusing on 2T perovskite/perovskite tandems53,54 or 2T MAPbI3 perovskite/polymer tandems55 with non-ideal Eg pairs may benefit from a move toward architectures with more ideal Eg pairs or toward 4T configurations due to the intrinsic efficiency limit of the proposed architectures, as can be inferred from Fig. 1a. We note, however, that the lack of truly predictive device simulations in the case of perovskite solar cells and its long-term performance represents a major impediment to recreating our detailed energy-yield calculations presented for II–VI inorganic compounds.
Summary and conclusions
In this paper we have addressed for the first time the question of energy-yield prediction for 2J tandem cells in real-world spectral climate conditions. One of the two sub-cells is built from of a mature, commercial thin-film technology. We achieve this goal by using a three-step modeling approach for (1) sub-cell material selection, (2) sensitivity assessment of the tandem efficiency on sub-cell device quality, and (3) an accurate, physics-based, and high-speed calculation of the annual tandem energy-yield using hourly climate spectra in different locations.
The most important learnings from this research are:
(1) First focusing on the lowest-cost tandem, a monolithic thin-film/thin-film 2T architecture, we find that a state-of-the-art CdTe top cell, coupled to a current-matched low-Eg bottom-cell material like GaSb, provides only a moderate energy-yield advantage, especially in humid climates. This is explained quantitatively through infrared light absorption from water vapor in the atmosphere, which mutes the bottom-cell current.
(2) The sensitivity to atmospheric water vapor is less pronounced in a 2T, higher-Eg tandem, using commercial CIGS as a bottom cell, and a high-Eg II–VI alloy like CdZnTe as a top cell. Here, the energy-yield advantage versus the 1J CdTe benchmark cell reaches between [25%, 123 kW h m−2 year−1] for a humid climate and [33%, 162 kW h m−2 year−1] for a dry climate, making it the best-performing architecture for a 2T tandem cell. We point out that for this tandem design significant R&D is required for (a) passivation recipes for high-Eg II–VI alloys, (b) transparent back-contacts for the top cell, (c) tunnel junction between the top and bottom cell, and (d) an efficient CIGS cell in superstrate configuration.
(3) The highest energy-yield advantage, in all climate spectra being considered (and up to [38%, 184 kW h m−2 year−1] in dry climates), is predicted for a 4T tandem with mature CdTe as top and mature CIGS as bottom cell. Of the three tandems studied, this architecture will require the least R&D. However, it also has the highest expected manufacturing cost and the highest capital expense for manufacturing facilities, because some steps in the module fabrication would have to be doubled if compared to a 2T monolithic tandem.
Ongoing work is addressing bottom-up cost modeling of the 2T and 4T tandems studied in this work. By detailing the cost breakdown into cost components which scale with area ($ per m2, mostly material and installation-related costs which benefit from higher energy-yield tandems) and those which scale with total system peak-power ($ per Wp, mostly power electronic and module interconnection-related costs which do not benefit from higher energy-yield tandems). We will then be able to calculate techno-economic parameters such as module $ per Wp, and more importantly system lifetime cost of electricity (LCOE) for tandem solar cells. This allows for a side-by-side comparison of a future tandem's cost of energy with that of state-of-the-art, low-cost 1J thin-film solar cells like CdTe.

Broader context
Tandem solar cells – i.e., solar cells consisting of not one but two or more cells stacked on top of each other – currently experience a renaissance in the academic research literature. Higher conversion efficiencies promised by tandems not only theoretically surpass single-junction cell limits, but also promise lower cost of energy. Assessment of the cost of solar energy however is a two-part problem, that of calculating the module manufacturing cost and that of calculating the actual energy yield of a solar cell – single junction or tandem – in real-world climate conditions. In this paper, MIT's PV Research Laboratory and First Solar's Performance Prediction and Development Engineering teams have teamed up to predictively answer the latter question, which is the more technically demanding of these two.

 	Fig. 3  TCO selection for Architecture A. (a) When FTO is used, there is a large infrared photon loss and consequently large Jsc-mismatch of 5 mA cm−2 (under AM1.5G) between the sub-cells due to infrared light reflection off the FTO–CdTe interface and FTO parasitic absorption, as simulated by TMM simulation. (b) Replacing FTO with ITO reduces infrared light reflection and parasitic absorption in the TCO layer, resulting in a lower Jsc-mismatch of 2.2 mA cm−2 (under AM1.5G).	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Semi-empirical annual energy-yield model for a 2T CdTe/GaSb tandem cell (Architecture A in the text) for dry (Albuquerque), temperate (Rapid City) and humid (Miami) climate. The symbols for 3T represent the energy-yield of an imaginary tandem with identical device layer stack but with independent maximum power point tracking of the two sub-cells. Loss mechanism (i) originates from a slight J-mismatch due to imperfect optics. Loss mechanism (ii) originates from additional J-mismatch due to atmospheric water vapor that mutes the bottom cell contribution. Tcell = 25 °C is assumed. (b) Spectral density of Jeq for AM1.5G spectrum, defined as the spectral density of Jsc which can be generated by a solar cell with perfect EQE(λ) throughout the entire AM1.5G spectrum range. H2O vapor absorption band in the atmosphere are indicated, as well as the spectral response range for high-Eg II–VI, CdTe, CIGS, and GaSb used in this model.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Semi-empirical annual energy-yield model for a 2T high-Eg II–VI/CIGS tandem (architecture B in the text). For the explanation of the 3T symbols see caption to Fig. 4. No reliance on λ > 1250 nm light and the usage of tunable EG II–VI top cell enables significant reduction in J-mismatch due to imperfect optics (i) for the dry climate, even when FTO is used. In humid climate, the J-mismatch loss is only slightly higher due to additional infrared spectrum suppression by atmospheric water vapor absorption (ii). Tcell = 25 °C is assumed. (b) Semi-empirical annual energy-yield model for a 4T CdTe/CIGS tandem (architecture C in the text). There is no J-mismatch loss in this configuration. In this model we also study the effect of cell operating temperature under illumination (data points denoted with T). The effect of power loss due to temperature (iii) can be calculated for 4T and 1J architectures (Tcell = 25 °C for filled points, simulated operating temperature for half-emptied points). Rs and Rsh used in this model are identical to those used in Fig. 4a and 5a.	 

A (2T)	[22%]	[23%]	[11%]
B (2T)	[33%]	[33%]	[25%]
C (4T)	[38%]	[38%]	[33%]
Tcell = Tamb + Geffα(1 − ε)/Uc	(3)
P(Tcell) = PSTC(1 + Tc(Tcell − TSTC))	(4)
