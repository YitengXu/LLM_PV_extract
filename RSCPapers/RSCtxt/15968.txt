1. Introduction
The requirement for alternative and sustainable sources of power becomes more urgent as we move further into the 21st century.1 Clean, inexpensive, and safe high energy and power density materials are required to enable the generation, storage, and conversion of (principally electrical) energy via non-polluting processes. Energy storage is accomplished by devices or physical media that store energy to perform useful operation. The energy present at the initial formation of the universe has been stored in stars such as the sun, and is now being used by humans directly (e.g. through solar heating), or indirectly (e.g. by growing crops or conversion into electricity by solar cells). In order to meet the desire for an efficient and clean power source fitting the development of peoples' daily life and production, scientists have never given up trying to improve the electrochemical performance of existing energy storage device techniques.2
Among the technologies for near-future energy storage are rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors (SCs).3 In the past two decades, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have achieved great successes due to their superior comprehensive battery performance, compared to lead–acid, Ni–Cd and Ni–MH batteries. However, like the previous battery techniques, their development has also met a bottleneck recently.4 Supercapacitors (SCs) bridge the gap between conventional capacitors and rechargeable batteries. Within SCs, the electrolyte is the conductive connection between the two electrodes, distinguishing them from electrolytic capacitors, in which the electrolyte only forms the cathode. Fuel cells (FCs) are devices that convert the chemical energy from a fuel into electricity through a chemical reaction with oxygen or another oxidizing agent.
To meet the requirement for near-future energy storage devices, high power and energy density energy storage devices call for consideration. Comparing the performance of different energy storage devices, Fig. 1 illustrates the energy density of energy storage devices as a function of power density, known as the “Ragone plot”.5 Fuel cells possess high energy density but low power density, SCs were observed to have higher power density but low energy density and LIBs with average power and energy density when compared to fuel cells and SCs. Thus, the development of high energy and power energy storage devices is highly pursued.

With respect to improving the high consumption of energy by humans, electrode materials applied in these energy storage devices become vigorously important. They put forward higher requirements on the state-of-the-art rechargeable LIBs and SCs in the aspect of not only charge–discharge performance, but also safety, cost, sustainability and environmental friendliness.6 In recent years, substantial efforts have been made in the exploration of novel electrode materials for LIBs and SCs with attractive specific capacity (capacitance) and excellent cycling stability.7,8 There are several potential advantages and disadvantages associated with the development of electrodes for energy storage devices. Shortly, materials for LIBs include a positive electrode named the “cathode” and a negative electrode termed the “anode”. Until recently, carbon and carbon based materials,9–13 metal oxides,14–17 nitrides,18,19 carbides,20–23 and their composites24–27 have been employed as anode materials for LIBs. With respect to cathode materials, Almost all the research and commercialization has centered on the layered compounds with an anion close-packed or almost close-packed lattice like LiCoO2,28,29 LiMnO2,30,31 and transition-metal phosphates, such as olivine LiFePO4.32,33 In SCs, carbonaceous materials, conducting polymers, metal oxides and composites of these aforementioned materials are the common electrode materials that have been employed extensively. For examples, carbonaceous materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene,34–37 conducting polymers such as PANI38 and polypyrrole,39 metal oxides such as MoO240,41 and MnO2,42 carbon nanocomposites,43–46 metal oxide composites,47 and so on have all been reported as electrode materials for SCs.
The demand and type of electrode materials have been briefly discussed above and the progresses in the development of these electrode materials are well summarized.7,27,48–53 Recently, in addition to carbon and metal oxides, metal nitrides have also been employed as high-performance electrode materials for LIBs and SCs due to their high specific capacities, high electrical conductivity, and high chemical and thermal stability and have been used widely as electrodes in energy storage devices. Particularly, transition metal nitrides are also of great interest because of their capability of storing lithium by the conversion mechanism. Most of the developed metal nitrides such as TiN,55 VN,56 Mo2N,57 FeN,58 Ni3N,59 NbN,60 Ta3N,61 and so on, are often used as anode materials in LIBs and SCs, while only LiMoN2 has been reported as the LIB cathode.54 In this review, we will summarize the progress of metal nitrides as electrode materials for LIBs and SCs. Also, the syntheses of some of these metal nitrides have also been discussed. Furthermore, we will also discuss the current challenges of the metal nitrides as electrode materials in LIBs and SCs.
2. General synthesis of metal nitrides
A significant and rapid progress in nitride chemistry has been seen over the last decade or so with improved classification and development of new synthetic routes leading to new nitride materials. The synthesis of nitrides is still very complex with large thermodynamic barriers which occur from the making and breaking of NN bonds (945 kJ mol−1 for NN compared to 498 kJ mol−1 for OO). Many nitrides, especially those containing s-block elements, are air and moisture sensitive, and rapidly form oxides, hydroxides and ammonia upon contact with oxygen or moisture. These factors can therefore contribute to the low abundance of nitride compounds, compared to those of the oxides or carbides. For most of the twentieth century, the chemistry of binary and ternary nitrides progressed very slowly, in marked contrast to the chemistries of metal oxides or fluorides. In major part, this slow development can be traced to the limited synthesis routes available, the direct route from the elements is limited by the great strength of the triple bond in dinitrogen which means that only highly thermally stable nitrides can be made by this method. Other routes from nitrogen compounds including ammonia or azides were limited to specific classes of compounds and resulting purities were sometimes poor. The known nitrides were often intractable, inert and difficult to characterize.62
Briefly, several methods have been developed to synthesize metal nitrides:63 (a) heating metals or samples mixed with carbon to high temperatures in N2 or NH3 environments and examining the recovered products have resulted in much of our current knowledge of transition metal nitride compounds and their phase relations64 and these techniques usually lead to formation of lower nitride materials; (b) high pressure and temperature synthesis approaches are also a way to synthesize metal nitrides;65–67 (c) ammonolysis of binary compounds, which involves the reactions of simple compounds such as chlorides, oxides and sulfides with ammonia, often produces nitrides, with the advantage of avoiding sinterable metals.68 This method has been employed by Choi and Kumta in the synthesis of Ta3N5 and WN;61 (d) ammonolysis of oxides, which involves heating the metal oxide directly in flowing NH3 while slowly raising the temperature. Such a preparation method has been employed by Lu's group in the synthesis of TiN and VN;69–71 and (e) vapor deposition of films, in which many of the most important nitride materials are deposited as films from the vapor phase by PVD, CVD and related techniques.68 The transition metal nitrides formed from vapor deposition techniques, which are usually in nano- or microcrystalline, are widely used in thin film formation.56,72,73 Other methods include solid state metathesis reactions (used in preparing alkali and alkaline-earth metal nitrides),74–77 solvothermal synthesis (employed in the fabrication of Al groups),78 sol–gel processing,79–81 theoretical predictions developed by Kroll et al.82–84 and so on.
3. Metal nitrides for lithium storage
As metal nitrides are emerging as new and promising electrode materials for high-performance LIBs,8,85 due to their excellent electrical conductivity70 and their low and flat potentials close to that of lithium metal,86 there is a need for a comprehensive account of such development. Metal nitrides are promising electrode materials due to their high Li ion diffusion. The metal nitride system reveals ordered and disordered phases with significant levels of lithium vacancies,87 because Li vacancies are the charge carriers in Li3N, which is a well-known fast-ion conductor with the highest Li+ conductivity observed in a crystalline solid electrolyte at ambient temperature.87 The formation of additional vacancies in the nitride phases implies their potential for enhanced lithium ion diffusion. The Li ion diffusivity in metal nitrides consists of inter and intralayer diffusion. The calculated Li ion diffusion of the parent compound (Li3N) is 9.02 × 10−14 m2 s−187 and some metal reported metal nitrides include 2.7 × 10−14 m2 s−1 for Li3−x−yCuxN,88 5.40 × 10−10 m2 s−1 for LiMn3N2,73 0.638 × 10−14 m2 s−1 for LiNiN87 and so on. Thus, metal nitrides also offer a suitable kinetic reaction, due to the fast diffusion of Li ions as a result of the Li vacancies after the conversion reaction, leading to relatively high power densities.86,92
Generally, metal nitrides are classified into two kinds namely lithium transition metal nitrides and single metal nitrides.73,89 These two kinds of metal nitrides have been widely studied and reported to be indexed to the conversion reaction mechanism, undergoing intercalation and deintercalation with lithium and also exhibiting good performance as electrode materials in LIBs in the early studies.54,72
3.1 Lithiated metal nitrides
A series of alternative anodes with improved capacity density and enhanced thermal safety have been highly investigated as substitutes for the commercial graphite in LIBs. Among them, Li-alloys and lithium transition metal nitrides appear to be the most promising candidates in terms of their reversible capacities and reactive potentials.1 However, the structural instability caused by the volume effects seriously hinders the possible application of Li-alloys. The substitution of transition metals has important consequences for the physical properties88,90 and it has been shown that substitution of an aliovalent transition metal increases the conductivity of nitrides.91 These kinds of nitrides are called “lithiated metal nitrides”. The first lithiated metal nitride was LiMoN2 by Elder and his co-workers.54 LiMoN2 was demonstrated as a cathode material in a voltage range of 2.7–4.2 V because of two pseudoplateaus located at an average voltage of 3.73 and 4.07 V. A capacity of about 110 mA h g−1 was delivered by the LiMoN2 electrode. During the discharge processes of LiMoN2, Li3N and the Mo atom were formed. Lithiated metal nitrides were mostly considered as LIB electrode materials due to the formation of Li3N when they come into contact with Li ions.92–94 In LIBs, when metal nitrides come into contact with Li ions, two reaction processes will likely occur; (1) Li ions will be located in the metal nitride layer and (2) Li ions will also be located between the metal nitride layers.92,93 Li3N, which dominated the nitride chemistry structure, has been a promising electrode material for LIBs based on the two reaction processes.

Fig. 2 shows the typical crystal structure of cubic Li3N. This structure shows that Li3N consists of a nitrogen atom surrounded by eight Li atoms and six Li atoms in the same plane, trigonally coordinated to the nitrogen atom, and one linearly coordinated to the nitrogen atom above and below the plane. Thus, they form a hexagonal bipyramid95 which shows an obvious effect on the electrochemical behavior of the hexagonal nitrides in the Li extraction stage.96 Newly developed lithium layer nitrides were anodes because their Li intercalation voltage plateau lies below 2 V.97–101 For instance, Nishijima et al. and Cabana et al. prepared Li7MnN4 with a discharge capacity of 210 mA h g−1 and 180 mA h g−1, respectively both displaying Li intercalation at about 1.1 V and Li de-intercalation at 1.3 V.102,103 Wen et al. achieved a discharge capacity of 400 mA h g−1 at 0.3 mA cm−2 after 50 cycles for lithium silicon nitride showing Li insertion and extraction at 0.5 V and 1.2 V respectively.104 A higher discharge capacity of over 500 mA h g−1 was reported by Rowsell et al. for layered Li2.7Fe0.3N due to two Li insertion voltage plateaus at 0.4 V and 1.18 V.89

Recently, Bach and his co-workers studied the influence of structure and ball-milling on the electrochemical properties of Li7MnN4 at 1 C rate (Fig. 3).105 The SEM image shows that the ball milled Li7MnN4 sample consists of small particles of a few μm from 2 to 5 μm (Fig. 3a). Li intercalation was observed at a voltage plateau of 1.14 and 1.2 V (Fig. 3b). Significantly, the ball-milled sample improved the specific capacity with about 60% increment (250 mA h g−1) when compared with the as-prepared sample (150 mA h g−1) (Fig. 3c). Even at a high current rate of 5 C, the ball-milled sample exhibited a stable capacity vs. cycles, around 120 mA h g−1, which is well comparable to the behavior achieved for Li4Ti5O12 (Fig. 3d). However, despite many efforts to achieve lithiated nitrides with high stability, the capacity fading in them appears to be the major predicament which is related to the electrochemical instability under high Li extraction and the interfacial incomparability caused by the decomposition of the passive film on the surface of the active hosts.106 In this way, studies of the electrochemical behavior of the quadruple lithiated metal nitrides have been reported. The morphology characteristic of quadruple lithiated metal nitrides has an obvious influence on the electrochemical stability of the compounds in the Li-extraction stage and as lithium storage hosts.96 Thus, low cost lithium transition metal nitrides with improved cyclability can be developed. For example, the expensive Co can be replaced partially by Ni and Cu. Liu et al. demonstrated the electrochemical performance of Li2.6Co0.2Cu0.2N, Li2.5Co0.2Cu0.1Ni0.1N and Li2.6Co0.2Cu0.15Fe0.05N as LIB anodes.96 This research reveals that these compounds show large reversible capacities of about 700–900 mA h g−1 at 0.15 mA cm−2 and excellent capacity retention due to electrochemical stability associated with the Li-extraction degree and the enhanced interfacial compatibility as a result of Ni substitution. The resulting electrochemical performance was also better than that of the pristine lithiated cobalt nitride with a reversible capacity retention of 400 mA h g−1.93 From the economical perspective, lithium is not readily available and quite limited in the earth's crust.107 It was believed that the lithium already available in the electrolyte (LiPF6, LiClO4) is enough for lithium intercalation and hence, ternary nitrides without lithiation such as Cr1−xFexN were reported by Qian and Zheng for the first time.58 A reversible capacity of above 1000 mA h g−1 was reported for Cr1−xFexN which is much higher than that of the lithiated nitrides. Their potential application was limited due to the large polarization of Cr.

3.2 Single metal nitrides for lithium storage
The development of single metal nitride thin films (also known as binary metal nitrides) as LIB electrode materials becomes rampant in the 2000's due to their average reversible capacity and stability108 and were also reported to possess better electrochemical properties than the corresponding lithiated metal nitrides.109 The binary metal nitrides have the ability to reduce the huge volume expansion, and hence a better cycling performance.73 Lithiated metal nitrides involve a calcined mixture of Li3N and transition metal powders while single nitrides require direct deposition of metal nitride powders on a thin film substrate. Primarily, single metal nitride materials are based on the binary compound formed readily between a metal and nitrogen such as lithium and nitrogen. As mentioned above, alkali metal nitrides are dominated by Li3N which is known to have high lithium-ion conductivity (approximately 10−3 S cm−1)110 when fabricated on a Li surface at room temperature.111 This remarkably simple compound has been known for over a century, but it is only within the last decade that the potential of the material and its derivatives has begun to be realized.112 In an attempt to improve the behavior of Li electrodes as LIB electrode materials, Li3N was often used to modify the surface of Li electrodes. For example, Aurbach and his co-workers modified the Li electrode by doping with Li3N and reported a discharge capacity of 480 mA h g−1 after 108 charge–discharge cycles.113 Wu et al. also compared the electrochemical behaviors of the as-received Li electrode and the Li3N modified Li metal electrode at different exposure times to N2.110 The capacity retention of the 1 h exposure N2 time Li3N modified Li metal electrode was about 20% higher than that of the as-received Li electrode. The enhanced performance of the Li3N modified Li metal electrode was due to the cycling efficiency of lithium which depends on N2 exposure time. Other alkali and alkaline-earth metal nitrides were synthesized but are debatable due to their low thermodynamic stability.114–116
On the other hand, binary transition metal nitrides are of interest for replacing alkali and alkaline-earth metal nitrides in thin-film lithium-ion batteries72,108,117 because of their low and flat potentials close to that of lithium metal along with high reversibility and large reversible capacities for lithium batteries.109,118 The pioneering work on transition metal nitrides was demonstrated by Bates et al. using Zn3N2 and Sn3N4 thin films as negative electrodes.119 Tin nitride was reported with initial discharge capacity over 1100 μA h cm−2, retaining about 520 μA h cm−2 capacity after 100 cycles.120,121 Also, stoichiometric germanium nitride also delivers a capacity of 500 mA h g−1, maintaining good cycling stability above 400 mA h g−1 at a current density of 11.4 mA g−1.122 However, these metal nitrides were observed to exhibit low capacity due to low valence and oxidation states. Therefore, it is of interest to examine the electrochemical reactivity of binary metal nitrides with high valence and oxidation states towards lithium. Higher capacity values of about 1000 mA h g−1 have been found in some transition metal nitrides due to their high valence such as in chromium or vanadium nitrides with the oxidation state of +356,123,124 and molybdenum nitride with the oxidation state of +2.57 This is because they possess the advantages of corrosion resistance, high temperature and chemical stability.125 Apart from transition metal nitrides, research has been reported on nitrides of platinum-group metals (Pt, Ir, Os, Ru, Rh, Pd),126–128 Os nitrides,129 and some nitride thin films of groups 5A and 6A.85,130 So much effort has been made to achieve metal nitride electrodes with remarkable cyclability, stability and high-rate performance for LIBs. However, metal nitride thin films were still unable to meet these requirements. Additionally, their preparations are not cost effective and very tedious. Metal nitride electrode materials with cheaper and convenient preparation processes that can accommodate large strains, reduce volume expansion and provide short diffusion pathways for Li+ insertion and extraction were required.
An approach to solve such problems of binary metal nitride films is to fabricate nanostructured metal nitrides. Attention was drawn to metal nitride nanostructures due to their low cost,68 environmental friendliness,68,131 ability to accommodate large strains, decrease in huge volume changes and provision of short diffusion pathways for Li+ insertion and extraction.25,131–136 Many metal oxide and carbon based electrodes have been reported for nanostructured materials and great achievements have been made.7,25,137–140 However, there are few reports on nanostructured metal nitrides when compared to metal oxide and carbon based electrodes.18 Nanostructured materials have also been discovered to overcome obstacles such as volume expansion and poor diffusion pathways in metal nitride electrodes.85 The development of metal nitride nanomaterials starts to gain attention as Chowdari and his co-workers reported the prime metal nitride nanomaterial, cobalt nitride (CoN) nanoflakes.85 CoN nanoflakes deliver a capacity of 990 and 690 mA h g−1 at 0.33 C and 6.6 C after 50 and 80 cycles respectively. The most interesting thing was that the discharge capacity of the nanoflake CoN increases with increasing cycling even at a high current rate of 6.6 C. Reddy and his co-workers compared the lithium storage performance of CoO, Co3O4 and CoN.141 Among these cobalt compounds, CoN was reported to be the best anode material. It was figured out that the excellent performance of CoN is due to the nitrogen that allows the formation of Li3N and Co, resulting in an even higher theoretical capacity of 1100 mA h g−1.
Recently, Chowdari et al. studied CoN nanoparticles as high performance anodes for LIBs.142 During the first cycle, a strong cathodic peak was observed at 0.49 V (Fig. 4a). In the subsequent cycles, the peak becomes broadened and shifts to the high voltage region. As a result, the first discharge capacity was 1290 mA h g−1 which was higher than the theoretical capacity of CoN (1102 mA h g−1). A capacity of 660 mA h g−1 and 470 mA h g−1 was retained after 60 cycles at a current rate of 0.31 C and 1.25 C respectively (Fig. 4b). This result shows higher reversibility and attractive cyclic performance than those of the lithiated cobalt nitride.92,93,143 Besides CoN, other transition metal nitrides have been widely used as anodes for LIBs59,144,145 due to their low cost, high molar density and superior chemical resistance.8,18 For example, CrN nanoparticles were studied by Chowdari et al. when the CrN was cycled at 0.1 C, the first-cycle reversible capacity of 635 mA h g−1 slowly decreases to 500 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles and remains stable up to the end of the 80th cycle. At 0.5 C, the CrN showed a stable capacity of 350 mA h g−1 for 40 cycles and the original capacity was regained when cycled at 0.1 C rate. Gillot et al. demonstrated the electrochemical behavior of nanostructured nickel nitride against lithium which delivers a specific capacity of about 1200 mA h g−1,59 while titanium nitride nanowires were also reported to have an initial discharge capacity of 567 mA h g−1 and a capacity retention of 455 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles.145

3.3 Metal nitride composites for lithium storage
Lithiated metal nitrides and single metal nitrides have contributed immensely to the electrochemical properties of metal nitrides as electrodes for LIBs. Recently, metal nitrides were combined with other electrodes to form composites. Composites have been proved to contribute effectively to the conductivity and stability of LIB electrode materials.146,147 Metal nitrides have been widely applied to stabilize the poor stability and improve the electrical conductivity of other prominent electrodes. Transition metal nitrides such as TiN were first used as composites to play the role of improving the conductivity and stability of other materials148 because they were reported to possess good electrical conductivity,149 extreme hardness,150,151 high melting temperature,152 and high chemical and thermal stability.153 In this regard, transition metal nitride composites are considered to be promising anode materials for LIBs due to their high reversible reaction, high rate capability and good stability.18 For instance, Kim and his co-workers reported the electrochemical properties of Si/TiN nanocomposites and TiN acts as an inactive material to maintain the stability of the nanocomposites.148 Apart from utilizing TiN to maintain the stability of nanocomposites, the metal nitrides also serve as protecting inactive materials for electrode materials with more vacant sites that can accommodate metal nitrides.154,155 This has given Li4Ti5O12 consideration because Li4Ti5O12 suffers from poor electronic conductivity156,157 but consists of vacant sites that can accommodate metal nitrides.158 For instance, DeSisto et al. prepared lithium titanate powder coated with a TiN layer.159 This composite delivers a high capacity of 160 mA h g−1 compared that of bare and unstable lithium titanate powder which is equal to 122 mA h g−1. The results obtained show an improved electronic conductivity. Park et al. also prepared Li4Ti5O12/TiN nanocomposites by annealing Li4Ti5O12 in flowing NH3 gas.160 An excellent discharge capacity of 120 mA h g−1 was delivered by the Li4Ti5O12/TiN composite at a high current rate of 10 C after 70 cycles mainly due to the formation of amorphous TiN with metallic conductivity on the surface of Li4Ti5O12.
Lately, the Li4Ti5O12 surface coated with TiN was reported by Zhang et al. (Fig. 5).161 As shown in Fig. 5a, the high-resolution TEM displays the successful coating of TiN on the Li4Ti5O12 surface which allows easy lithium transportation enabling the composites to have a high capacity of 130 mA h g−1 at a charge–discharge rate of 20 C (Fig. 5b). 85% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 10 C was delivered (Fig. 5c). The first reversible capacity of about 200 mA h g−1 and redox peaks at 1.45 V and 1.66 V confirm the Li+ insertion/extraction behavior of the Li4Ti5O12 surface coated with the TiN electrode (Fig. 5d). Zhang's work displays excellent stability and rate capability as a result of improved conductivity concluding that this electrode has great potential as an anode material for high-rate LIBs.52 Enlightened by successful coating of metal nitrides on the surface of Li4Ti5O12, many research studies were reported based on partial nitridation of the metal oxide surfaces. This partial nitridation method could avoid the high temperature risk of annealing electrode materials in NH3 gas to obtain metal nitrides. For example, TiO2 was slightly nitrided in NH3 gas to obtain nitridated TiO2.162 The nitridated TiO2 delivers a discharge capacity of 156 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C and about 50 mA h g−1 at a high current rate of 10 C which are two times higher than those of bare TiO2 nanofibers at the same current rates. The improvement of the nitridated TiO2 was mainly attributed to shorter lithium ion diffusion length and high electronic conductivity along the surface of nitridated hollow nanofibers. Also, Zheng et al. modified the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles with Fe3N.163 The Fe3O4@Fe3N nanocomposites exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, such as a high reversible capacity over 739 and 620 mA h g−1 after each 60 cycles at a current density of 50 and 200 mA g−1. The improvement was confirmed to be attributed to the Fe3N coated layer, which could largely enhance the electronic conductivity and protect the Fe3O4 nanoparticles from the large variation of volume during the reaction with Li ions.

Recently, Liu et al. reported that nanocoating of Mo2N on the surface of MoO2 is highly effective in improving the conductivity of MoO2 compared to the bare MoO2 (Fig. 6).153 The products in the first step (reduction of MoO3 to MoO2) were well indexed to a monoclinic cell with a = 5.620(8) Å, b = 4.868(2) Å and c = 5.633(4) Å, confirming that the product obtained by reducing MoO3 powders is MoO2 with a monoclinic structure. In the nitridation to Mo2N, (second step), the XRD patterns of the products show another wide peak, which also matched with a strong peak (200) of cubic Mo2N (Fig. 6a). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image taken from the edge of an individual nitrided MoO2 nanocrystal subsequently displays how the Mo2N was formed on the surface of the MoO2 (Fig. 6b). When these composites react with lithium, a high specific capacity of up to 815 mA h g−1 at more than 100 cycles was reported which is two times higher than that of bare MoO2 (Fig. 6c). A very high-rate discharge capacity of 415 mA h g−1 at a current density of 5000 mA g−1 can also be observed in Fig. 6d which is almost three times higher that that of MoO2. Interestingly, such excellent electrochemical performance could be observed by the Mo2N coated MoO2 without the use of binder i.e. the Mo2N coated MoO2 electrode is a binder free electrode.

Binder free electrodes have attracted significant attention as a result of their ability to reduce the internal resistance that could lead to improved electrochemical performance of LIBs164–167 Due to this intriguing advantage of the binder free materials, carbonaceous materials such as graphene168,169 entice researchers because carbonaceous materials are binder free which also have high electrical conductivity.170–172 The combination of such binder free materials and metal nitrides has been proved to contribute positively to the conductivity of metal nitrides173 For instance, Zhang's paper reported a VN and graphene composite with an initial coulombic efficiency of 74.6% which is higher than that of the pristine VN at 55.8%.174 An increase in discharge capacity up to 983 mA h g−1 after 175 cycles was observed due to the fact that there is a strong synergistic effect between VN and G after considerable cycles. VN was mixed with graphene in order to simultaneously improve the electronic conductivity and the coulombic efficiency of the composites.
Also similar work was carried out by Yue et al. in an in situ synthesis of a binder free graphene/titanium nitride (G/TiN) hybrid material as shown in Fig. 7.175 An increase in the initial coulombic efficiency from 52% to 75% is acquired after TiN integration. The TEM carried out before and after cycling shows that TiN nanoparticles display little change, as the lattice parameters are found to be identical before and after cycling which presents considerable defects, possibly from the incorporation of N during material synthesis, which could partially be responsible for the enhanced property. The G/TiN hybrid anode exhibits a reversible capacity as high as 325 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1 much higher than that of pure graphene at 98 mA h g−1 after about 35 cycles (Fig. 7a). Its electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results justify that an enhanced electronic conductivity was observed due to the addition of TiN (Fig. 7b), indicating that the integration of TiN on G is beneficial for the formation of a favorable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer and charge transfer resistance. The SEI layer is the layer formed when the electrolyte decomposes during the discharge process of an electrode material in LIBs. Electrolyte decomposition in the graphene/TiN could lead to the formation of some products, which might be responsible for the excellent electrochemical performance of the G/TiN composites compared to the bare graphene electrode. This demonstrates that metal nitride hybrids display a superior electrochemical performance owing to their highly efficient mixed (electron and Li+) conducting network. For proper clarification of the electrochemical performances of these nitrides, we summarized the results of some reported studies in Table 1. Table 1 shows the theoretical capacity (TC) and experimental capacity (EC) of some metal nitrides that have been used as electrode materials in LIBs. The TC of metal nitride composites is based on the TC of the core material. For example, for the Li4Ti5O12@TiN composite, the TC is 175 mA h g−1 which is the TC of Li4Ti5O12.

In recent years, flexible electronics are emerging and promising technology for next-generation, high-performance portable electronic devices.176,177 They require the development of thin, lightweight, and flexible energy-supply devices such as LIBs and SCs.178 Future demand necessitates the development of advanced electrode materials with high capacity, rate capability, cycling stability, electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility.179 In recent years, lots of flexible full LIBs based on CNTs,180 cellulose paper,181 graphene,182 metal oxides,164,183 binary metal oxides;184 and metal sulfides185 have been reported. Flexible devices based on metal nitrides are rarely reported.189 Metal nitrides possess interesting mechanical properties such as high hardness, contradictory ductile vs. brittle behavior and the presence of vacancies on the metal and anion sites in their components, which make them suitable for application in flexible devices.186,187
Lu et al. demonstrated the first metal nitride based anode flexible LIBs (Fig. 8).145 Flexible TiN nanowires were first studied as anodes for LIBs in a half-cell and a high initial discharge capacity of 567 mA h g−1 was reported (Fig. 8a). The flexible TiN anode retains 80% of the initial capacity after 100 electrochemical cycles. Also, at a high current density of 1675 mA g−1, it could deliver a capacity of 288 mA h g−1 (Fig. 8b). The flexible TiN nanowire was then used as an anode material in the fabrication of a flexible full LIB. Fig. 8c shows the graphical structure of the flexible LIBs with the flexible TiN as the anode, LiCoO2 as the cathode, the LiPF6 electrolyte and a separator. The initial discharge capacity of the battery is 167 mA h g−1 at the normal position with a capacity retention of 95% after 120 cycles. The charge–discharge curves plotted for the LiCoO2//TiN-900 full battery at the normal position and bent position were very similar (Fig. 8d). The impedance of the battery at the normal and bent position is almost the same when EIS measurements were performed which verify that the bending has no negative effect on the resistance of the battery. This flexible full LIB could power a red light-emitting diode (LED) when bent as displayed in the inset of Fig. 8d.

4. Metal nitrides for supercapacitors
The electrodes for SCs are the main question mark. Carbon materials, transition metal oxides and conducting polymers have been widely investigated as supercapacitor electrodes. Carbon-based materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene possess prominent electrochemical stability and high electrical conductivity, but they suffer from low specific capacitance (90 to 250 F g−1), which makes them very challenging to develop high energy density SCs.189 On the other hand, metal oxides and conducting polymers can deliver substantially higher specific capacitances of 300–1200 F g−1 through Faradaic reactions. However, their poor conductivity and general kinetic irreversibility limit their practical application for high energy density SCs.27,190,191
Metal nitrides have attracted increasing attention as SCs electrodes since they have significant advantages. Firstly, they have excellent much superior electrical conductivity (4000–55500 S cm−1) than most of the metal oxides, and thus exhibiting higher power density.71,192 Secondly, the capacitances of the metal nitrides are substantially larger than those of the carbon materials and comparable to most of the metal oxides, which gives rise to their high energy density.69,192 Third, they also possess high mechanical stability compared to the metal oxides.193–196 These features make them very promising as high-performance electrodes for SCs.
Many research studies have demonstrated the use of various transition metal nitrides in SCs.70,71 Bouhtiyya et al. summarized the performance of different metal nitrides, using KOH electrolyte solution. These nitrides have shown a capacitive behavior at high scan rates due to their high electronic conductivity and fast reversible redox process (Fig. 9).197 Apart from the commonly reported metal nitrides, especially those metal nitrides in Fig. 9, some other nitrides such as niobium nitride (NbN), tungsten nitride (WN) and tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) have been reported.60,61 Choi and Kumta reported that, after 500 cycles in 1 M KOH solution, NbN could retain a capacitance of 100% indicating no loss in the capacitance of NbN.60 This was even better than Mo2N that has already lost 40% after 500 cycles. Also, only a 20% decrease in specific capacitance was observed for WN in 1 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.61 The next subsection will deeply discuss details about the development of Mo2N, TiN and VN as SC electrode materials, as part of the most commonly reported SC electrodes based on metal nitrides.

4.1 Molybdenum nitride based SCs
Among the transition metal nitrides, molybdenum nitrides were the first metal nitrides to be reported as SC electrode materials.198 Conway and his co-workers considered the high cost of RuO2 and evaluated Mo2N and MoN as possible substitutes for RuO2. The films of molybdenum nitrides exhibit quite similar capacitative behavior to that of RuO2. Li et al. synthesized Mo2N nanoparticles and studied their electrochemical performance as SC electrodes.199 The as-prepared γ-Mo2N nanoparticles showed good electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 172 F g−1 and a broadened potential window ranging from −0.6 V to 0.5 V in 1 mol L−1 H2SO4 electrolyte. Also, Kherani et al. showed that Mo2N shows a specific capacitance of 16 mF cm−2 which is 200 times higher than its corresponding oxide (0.67 mF cm−2) when cycled in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.200 The excellent performance of the Mo2N compared to the MoO2 was attributed to the pseudocapacitive effect of Mo nitride. After nitridation, the Mo film also exhibited enhanced stability in an acidic environment compared to the as-deposited Mo oxide film. An important difference between the nitride films and RuO2 is that the potential range of reversible capacitative behavior is only over ca. 0.6 V, unlike RuO2 for which the range is ca. 1.4 V. Beyond the range of 0.6 V in the positive direction, decomposition or some dissolution of the nitride films takes place. The potential range of capacitance behavior is an important factor for practical supercapacitor development and ideally, it should be limited only by the voltage window of the electrolyte solution. This places a severe limitation on the usefulness of MoN or Mo2N films as substitutes for RuO2 in redox-pseudocapacitance types of capacitor devices. In an attempt to increase the potential range of molybdenum nitrides, Wang et al. reported the addition of tantalum oxide to molybdenum nitride with a potential window of −0.2–0.85 V.201 Such a potential window was higher than those reported from some other molybdenum nitrides but still unable to reach that of RuO2 at 1.4 V.199,202 Contemplating the issue of increasing the potential range of molybdenum nitrides, increasing the capacitance of molybdenum nitride remains a vital challenge. Combining molybdenum nitride with other compounds, some improved capacitance was recorded.203–205 In Wang's work, the composite of Mo2N/Co3Mo3N provides a specific capacitance of 109.9 F g−1206 and a specific capacitance of 105.83 F g−1 for tantalum oxide and molybdenum nitride composites201 while the pristine Mo2N could only deliver 30 F g−1 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1.
4.2 Titanium nitride based SCs
Compared to Mo2N, titanium nitride (TiN) has attracted great interest for SCs207 because of its superior electrical conductivity (4000−55500 S cm−1)208 and mechanical stability.209 For instance, Kherani's group recorded a specific capacitance of 0.067 mF cm−2 for TiN in H2SO4 electrolyte solution at 50 mV s−1 (ref. 200) and Sun et al. also fabricated TiN nanorods by an electrospinning method.210 The TiN nanorods showed a specific capacitance of 38.5 F g−1 at a current density of 40 mA g−1 in KOH electrolyte. Cui's group prepared mesoporous TiN microspheres with 144 F g−1 at 50 mA g−1 in LiPF6 electrolyte solution211 likewise the specific capacitance evaluated by cyclic voltammetry in 1 M KOH electrolyte was 238 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1 for nanocrystalline TiN.212 However, the application of TiN electrodes is greatly limited by their poor stability.211,213
To understand the electrochemical instability of TiN nanostructures, Lu et al. used TiN nanowires as an example to elucidate the mechanism causing the capacitance loss.70 They systematically studied the modifications of the morphology, chemical composition, and electrical conductivity of the flexible TiN nanowire electrode during the cycling process, and revealed that the irreversible electrochemical oxidation reactions and structural pulverization are the main reasons for the electrochemical instability of TiN electrodes (Fig. 10). Fig. 10a demonstrates the cyclic performance of TiN at different temperatures up to 5000 cycles. The specific capacitances of TiN electrodes increase gradually in the first 1000–2000 cycles due to the self-activation process and then suffer from a drastic loss of capacitance. The capacitance retentions for the TiN-800, TiN-900, and TiN-1000 samples at 5000 cycles are measured to be 18.6%, 24.5%, and 65.8%, respectively (Fig. 10a) but still higher than some other early reports.210–212 It is clear that a substantial improvement of TiN electrochemical stability is essential for practical application. To understand the origin of the instability of TiN NWs, the chemical composition during the cycling test was studied. Fig. 10b shows the N1s XPS spectrum collected for the TiN-800 electrode at different cycles. The nitride and oxynitride N 1s XPS peaks decrease gradually and consequently disappear after 3000 cycles. This indicates that the instability of the TiN electrode is due to the irreversible electrochemical oxidation reaction in aqueous solution. A solid-state polymer electrolyte was then used to enhance the stability of the TiN nanowires. The electrochemical stability of the TiN-SCs was examined at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 and the TiN electrode shows greatly improved stability with an extremely high capacitance retention of 82% after 15000 cycles (Fig. 10c), compared to the same TiN electrode tested in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. To demonstrate the potential use of these flexible solid-state TiN-SCs, supercapacitor units in series to drive light-emitting-diodes (LED) were connected. The electrochemical performances of the tandem TiN-SCs (two or three devices connected in series) were evaluated by charge–discharge measurements (Fig. 10d). These tandem devices exhibit an enhanced potential window, which can power red and blue LEDs that have the lowest working potential of 1.5 and 2.5 V, respectively (Fig. 10d, inset).

Recently, Lu et al. further extended this work by using a thin carbon shell to improve the cycling stability and capacitive performance of metal nitrides in solution-based electrolytes (Fig. 11).69 Carbon coating has been reported not only to improve the conductivity of electrode materials for energy storage devices but can also improve the stability.214–217Fig. 11a shows the HRTEM of the composites which confirms the successful coating of the thin carbon shell on the surface of the TiN. The TiN@C electrode achieved a specific capacitance of 124.5 F g−1 at 5 A g−1, which was higher than those of the TiN (107 F g−1) and C (17.3 F g−1) electrodes (Fig. 11b). The TiN@C sample had a better capacitance rate capability. It retained more than 78.3% of its initial capacitance when the current density was increased from 0.25 to 5 A g−1, while the retention rate was 70.2% for the TiN sample. More importantly, the TiN@C electrode exhibited a remarkable long-term stability, with 91.7% of its initial capacitance retained after 15000 cycles as compared to 9.1% for the TiN electrode (Fig. 11c). This value was even higher than the values obtained for the TiN electrodes (82%) in solid-state devices70 and is the best cycling stability ever achieved for TiN materials and for other metal–nitride materials. These results proved that the deposition of the ultrathin uniform carbon shell can effectively improve the capacitance and stability of TiN. Likewise, this method can also improve the electrochemical stability of other metal nitride electrodes for SCs. After coating a thin carbon shell, the VN@C electrode retained more than 88.4% of its initial capacitance after 15000 cycles (Fig. 11d), which is substantially higher than that of the VN nanowire electrode (8.5%) and the other previously reported VN nanostructures.218,219 Such significant improvements in capacitive performance and stability are due to the fact that the ultrathin carbon shell not only effectively suppresses the electrochemical oxidation of the TiN NWs and retains their electrical conductivity, but it also preserves their morphology.

Improving both the capacitance and conductivity of metal nitrides as electrode materials for SCs still demands much attention. Using metal nitride composites was considered by many researchers as a strategy to simultaneously improve the capacitance and electronic conductivity. Thus, they are combined with other materials such as conducting polymers,220 carbonaceous materials221 and metal oxides222 in order to improve or maintain stability and enhance rapid electron transportation in the electrodes. Among the materials metal nitrides often composite with, conducting polymers were coated on the surface of metal nitrides due to their ease of preparation and good environmental stability combined with moderate electrical conductivity.223 This is to avoid the cycling degradation caused by volume changes and can also contribute to high pseudo-capacitance performance.224 However, few studies were reported for conducting polymers and metal nitride composites. Qiu and Gao studied PANI/TiN composites and their results show that the structure, morphology and electrochemical performance were controlled by the TiN,225 another group recently demonstrated that the PANI/TiN hybrid exhibits a capacity retention of 93% after 200 cycles in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution.226 The galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements of Ppy–TiN and Ppy–TiO2 nanotube hybrids were also compared.227 The Ppy–TiN has a specific capacitance of 1265 F g−1 which is higher than that of Ppy–TiO2 (382 F g−1) at a current density of 0.6 A g−1 in 1 M electrolyte solution of H2SO4. Also, the Ppy–TiN composite exhibits a stable capacitance of 459 F g−1 after 2000 cycles at a high current density of 15 A g−1. The highly conductive titanium nitride substrate can promote the electrochemical capacitance of polypyrrole more significantly, as compared to the titania semiconductor, contributing to a higher supercapacitance performance of Ppy–TiN. Chu et al. studied a coaxial PANI/TiN/PANI nanotube array suitable for high-performance SCs in HCl electrolyte solution.228 The nanocomposite electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 242 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2. After charging–discharging for 3000 cycles, 83% of the initial capacitance was retained.
Besides carbon coating and conducting polymers, the chemical stability of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), their high surface area and unique mesoporous network allow us to obtain composite materials with higher capacitance and better cycle life.220,229,230 The electrical conductivities of TiN were improved by CNTs in a study reported by Jiang et al.231 As the content of CNTs increases, the surface area also increases and enhanced electrical conductivity of about 3.6 times from 144 to 516 S cm−1 was achieved. CNT–TiN nanocomposites were also fabricated by Jiang and Gao with enhanced electrical properties.230 In the presence of 12 vol.% CNTs, the CNT–TiN composite exhibits a 45% increase in electrical conductivity compared to that of the TiN material. The addition of CNTs still retains the original electrochemical stability of TiN after cycling. Another approach that has been used to achieve high capacitance for metal nitride is combining metal nitride with some higher energy density materials. For example, the MnO2/TiN heterogeneous nanostructure has been designed for energy storage in SCs which delivers a specific capacitance of 662 F g−1 at 45 A g−1 in 1 M HCl aqueous solution,232 the NixCo2x(OH)6x/TiN electrode exhibits superior pseudocapacitive performance with a high specific capacitance of 2543 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1, remarkable rate performance of 660 F g−1 at 500 mV s−1, and promising cycle performance with about 6.25% capacitance loss for 5000 cycles in 0.1 M KOH and 1.9 M KCl aqueous solution.233
The same group also studied one dimensional MnO2/TiN nanotube coaxial arrays for high performance electrochemical capacitive energy storage (Fig. 12).222Fig. 12a shows the enclosed area of the CV curve, which was used to estimate the capacitance and is more than 4-fold larger after the deposition of MnO2. The rate capability of this nanostructured electrode was remarkable, as it maintains a nearly ideal capacitive CV shape with only small distortions even at a very high scan rate of 2000 mV s−1. This result in only a 45% loss of capacitance compared with that one measured at 2 mV s−1 (Fig. 12b). The Nyquist plot of the MnO2/TiN nanotube coaxial arrays suggests that the nanostructured current collector provides an increased contact area with the active materials, and also enhances the electronic conductivity of the electrode. This research work figures out that the highly conductive and mechanically stable TiN greatly enhances the flow of electrons to the MnO2 material, with improved high power combining the favorable structural, electrical and energy properties of MnO2 and TiN into one system which allows for a promising electrode material for SCs. Based on the development of TiN as the electrode material for SCs, the specific capacitance and rate capability delivered by some of the TiN electrodes are outlined in Table 2, as well as the electrolyte solution selected for the electrochemical measurements.

4.3 Vanadium nitride based SCs
Among the metal nitrides, vanadium nitride (VN) is emerging as the most attractive candidate as the electrode material for SCs due to its ultrahigh specific capacitance of 1340 F g−1 and high electrical conductivity (σbulk = 1.67 × 106 Ω−1 m−1). Earlier, Choi et al. synthesized chemically nanostructured VN for pseudocapacitor application and reported that the low-temperature synthesized nitrides exhibited the smallest crystallite size (≈6.3 nm) and a high specific capacitance of 850 F g−1 at a current rate of 50 mV s−1.194 The high capacitance obtained was due to a pseudocapacitance contribution from the nitride because the specific surface area of the nitride is only 38 m2 g−1.
By increasing the scan rate, the same group also reported a fast and reversible surface redox reaction in nanocrystalline vanadium nitride as displayed in Fig. 13.218Fig. 13a shows that the specific capacitance improves with reduced material loading, and the highest specific capacitance of 1340 F g−1 is recorded at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1, which decreases to 554 F g−1 when tested at 100 mV s−1. Also, at a high rate of about 2 V s−1, an impressive specific capacitance of 190 F g−1 was obtained (Fig. 13b). The impressive specific capacitance which exceeds that of ruthenium oxides has never been observed in transition metal nitrides, which indicates its possible use in electrochemical devices desirous of intermittent high pulse power. Fig. 13c shows that the charge mechanism of the VN crystals appears to arise from a combination of electrical double-layer formation and the Faradaic redox reactions that occur on the surface of the partially oxidized nitride. As a result, it can be seen in Fig. 13d that the VN nanocrystals can maintain a high specific capacitance (ca. 400 F g−1) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 up to more than 1000 cycles without much loss (<10%). The rate capability of the VN delivered by Choi's work still requires further improvement. With respect to different preparation methods and an effort to improve the electronic conductivity of VN, different VNs were prepared. For example, the VN powder was observed to have a capacitance of 161 F g−1 at 30 mV s−1 when synthesized by calcining the V2O5 xerogel in a furnace under an anhydrous NH3 atmosphere at 400 °C as reported by Zhou et al.196 In another example, Glushenkov and his co-workers reported in their work, structure and capacitive properties of porous nano-crystalline VN prepared by temperature-programmed ammonia reduction of V2O5 and a capacitance of 186 F g−1 was delivered by the nano-crystalline VN at a current density of 1 A g−1 in KOH electrolyte.219 Recently, Shu and his co-workers recorded an enhanced capacitance of 413 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and 88% of the maximum capacitance was retained when studied at a current load of 4 A g−1 which indicates the excellent rate capability of the nanocrystalline VN.237 The method of preparation has a lot to do with the improved electrochemical performance of VN, and we tabulated some of the results obtained for VN in Table 3. Table 3 illustrates different syntheses of VN as reported by different groups including their specific capacitance, scan rates and voltage window.

Despite all these achievements, the application of vanadium nitride as the SC electrode was still limited due to poor cyclic stability and short cycle life. To overcome such obstacles, Lu et al. studied the degradation mechanism of VN nanowires and utilized the LiCl/PVA polymer electrolyte to improve simultaneously the stability and the electronic conductivity of VN nanowires (Fig. 14).71 The CV curves present essentially the same shape as the scan rate increases from 10 to 100 mV s−1, indicating the good capacitive behavior of VN nanowires (Fig. 14a). The VN nanowire electrode achieved an excellent specific capacitance of 298.5 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The electrode exhibited remarkable cycling stability in LiCl/PVA gel electrolyte with a capacitance retention of 95.3% after 10000 cycles while 14.1% capacitance was obtained in 5 M LiCl aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 14b). Fig. 14c shows the core level V 2p XPS spectra indicating why the VN nanowire electrode exhibits poor stability in aqueous electrolyte. This results from the oxidation of VN to VOx after cycling measurement. The VN nanowire electrode was employed as the anode in asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). Fig. 14d shows that the VN/VOx ASCs can operate up to a voltage of 1.8 V which is higher than that of RuO2. The ASC device achieved a volumetric capacitance of 1.35 F cm−3 at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 with a remarkable rate capability, which retained about 74.7% of the initial capacitance (1.01 F cm−3) as the scan rate increased from 0.5 to 5 mA cm−2. The VOx//VN-ASC device achieved a remarkable volumetric energy density of 0.61 mW h cm−3 at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2, which is 7 times higher than that of the VN-SSC device (0.079 mW h cm−3).

Owing to the improvement of the electrical conductivity of VN as the electrode material for SCs, composites of VN were employed. For example, Ghimbeu and his co-workers demonstrated VN/CNT composites.239 The VN/CNT composites delivered high capacitance retention (58%) at high current density (30 A g−1) compared with just 7% of the pristine VN. The incorporation of CNTs during VN synthesis allows us to obtain VN/CNT nanocomposites with higher porosity, narrower pore size distribution, better conductivity and improved electrochemical properties. Furthermore, Zhang et al.240 reported high rate SCs from three-dimensional arrays of vanadium nitride functionalized carbon nanotubes (VN/GC) which demonstrated a respectable specific capacitance of 289 F g−1 in 1 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1, a superb rate capability at a very high scan rate of 1000 mV s−1. They adopted a simple methodology to develop multiwalled carbon nanotubes conformally covered by nanocrystalline vanadium nitride. Such composites of VN were used to fabricate flexible SCs. A typical example is the work of Zhang et al.241 who demonstrated spherical porous VN and NiOx as electrode materials for asymmetric supercapacitors. The VN/NiOx asymmetric supercapacitor shows a sloping voltage profile from 0.5 to 1.45 V with excellent reversibility and delivers a specific capacitance of 139 F g−1 and excellent rate capability. It also displays a good cycling behavior with about 15% specific capacitance decay after 1000 cycles with a specific energy of 26 W h kg−1. Zhou's group fabricated flexible freestanding mesoporous VN nanowire (MVNNs)/CNT SCs and the electrochemical performance of the single electrode and hybrid symmetric supercapacitors (SSCs) are displayed in Fig. 15.242 The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves shown in Fig. 15a indicated that the capacitance of the MVNN electrode was much larger than that of the CNT and MVNN electrode. The areal capacitance of the freestanding MVNN/CNT hybrid films in Fig. 15b was 178 mF cm−2 at a discharge current density of 1.1 mA cm−2. The results obtained from a further study of the MVNN/CNT electrode in SSCs were highly attractive. The CV curves of the MVNN/CNT SSCs had an almost rectangular shape between 0 and 0.7 V with scan rates varied from 5 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1 (Fig. 15c). Furthermore, galvanostatic charge–discharge curves indicated that the charging curves were almost symmetrical. The volumetric capacitance was 7.9 F cm−3 at 0.025 A cm−3 and remained at 4 F cm−3 at 0.5 A cm−3. The energy and power densities were calculated to be 0.54 mW h cm−3 and 0.4 W cm−3 respectively. The capacitance remained 82% of the initial capacitance at a current density of 0.2 A cm−3 after 10000 charge–discharge cycles as shown in Fig. 15d.

In addition, with the enthusiastic development of TiN and VN as SC electrode materials, the combination of higher specific capacitance of VN and better rate capability of TiN named ternary nitrides has attracted the interest of many researchers but few developments have been made. Ternary nitrides are nitrides with two metal nitrides combined to form a composite. Dong and his co-workers synthesized TiN/VN composites and they reported that these composites deliver a specific capacitance of 170 F g−1.55 They attributed their excellent result to both vanadium and titanium nitrides having the same diffraction patterns and similar cell parameters which allow fast transportation of electrons, and hence exhibiting excellent storage performance. Also, mesoporous coaxial titanium nitride–vanadium nitride fibers of core–shell structures for high-performance SCs were reported by Zhou et al.236 These hybrids exhibited a higher specific capacitance of 247.5 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1 and a better rate capability of 160.8 F g−1 at 50 mV s−1. They related their higher specific capacitance and better rate capability to the mesoporous structure with unique dimensional structure and higher surface-area of the high electronic conducting transition nitride hybrids, which combined the higher specific capacitance of VN and the better rate capability of TiN.
5. Conclusion and outlook
Contemplating the issue of selecting efficient electrode materials for energy storage devices, different electrode materials such as metal oxides, conducting polymers, carbonaceous materials have been discussed. Recently, metal nitrides have successfully gained an upper hand as electrode materials for LIBs and SCs due to their interesting morphology, high energy density, corrosion resistance and better cyclic characteristics. In this review, we summarize the progress of metal nitrides as promising electrode materials for LIBs and SCs. As for LIBs, different types of metal nitrides categorized by their nitride position have been reviewed with an emphasis on how these positions have affected their lithium storage performance positively. Based on the mostly reported metal nitride, we also discussed the development of metal nitrides as SC electrodes. Moreover, the development of metal nitrides for flexible energy storage devices has also been epitomized. Additionally, challenges of application of metal nitrides in energy storage devices such as LIBs and SCs were discussed and ways to develop them were also summarized.
Absolutely, electrode materials would involve a series of complex chemical and physical phenomena at the interface of electrode/electrolyte during the charge and discharge process. During this process, electrode materials face different difficulties such as volume expansion, poor conductivity, poor stability, stacking and so on. All these difficulties lead to poor electrochemical performance of the electrode materials for energy storage devices. Despite the fact that lots of achievements have been made on metal nitrides and these achievements have been discussed in this review, there exists substantial room for the development of more metal nitrides with excellent electrochemical performance and the increasing interest in developing more energy storage device electrodes materials is still a great challenge.
(1) Highly conductive materials should play a multi-functional role at this point because they tend to facilitate easy electron transportation during electrochemical processes and also reduce the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. Metal nitrides are promising electrode materials because of their high electrical conductivity. When utilized as single electrodes in LIBs and SCs, they showed high reversibility and capacitance respectively. They also showed high coulombic efficiencies indicating that they can reduce the formation of the SEI layer in LIBs. However, metal nitrides suffer from poor stability. In order to address this problem, attention was diverted to the synthesis of nanostructured metal nitride materials so as to increase electron transportation and provide short diffusion pathways.86 In fact, nanostructured metal nitride materials have significantly upgraded the poor stability of metal nitrides. More studies have been demonstrated for ternary metal oxides but few have been reported for metal nitrides for both LIBs and SCs. These ternary nitrides were even proved to be cost effective and also show high capacitance (capacity) and excellent rate capability compared to the single nitrides.8,243
(2) Hybrid coating and composites also play an important role in the development of more conductive and stable electrode materials for LIBs and SCs.244 Metal nitrides, especially TiN, have been successfully coated along with other materials (such as metals, metal oxides and nitrides, conducting polymers, etc.) as inactive conductive materials to stabilize the rapid decrease in the capacity of the materials in LIBs or as current collectors in SCs.222,232 Nevertheless, since TiN has been reported to have high electrical conductivity, low cost, high molar density and superior chemical resistance, further research is still required to be demonstrated on other transition metal nitrides. The problem of instability of electrode materials has been solved to a certain extent with the coating of carbonaceous materials. Metal nitrides coated with carbon have been studied not only to improve the stability of the electrode but also increase the capacity (capacitance).69,173 It is much promising to utilize such coating methods to improve the stability of more metal nitrides. Both carbonaceous materials and metal nitrides were reported to have good electrical conductivities. Their composites might yield excellent stability, attractive rate capability and high capacity. Moreover, more attention should be paid to metal nitride composites and other carbon based materials such as graphene and CNTs. Few studies have been reported for such composites. These carbonaceous materials have not only been widely reported as conducting materials but also as binder free materials which significantly improve the stability of other electrode materials.169,220 Such improvement still remains a vital challenge for metal nitrides.
(3) Furthermore, the development of flexible electronic devices has attracted great attention due to their thinness, lightweight and flexibility.245 It is highly demanded to have flexible devices with high energy density, thus, fabrication of electrode materials with high energy density becomes a vital challenge. Selecting suitable materials that can meet this challenge, metal nitrides were considered as favorable candidates because TiN70 and VN71 have been proved to exhibit high energy densities in the fabrication of SSCs and ASCs and also better performance than many of the reported metal oxides and carbonaceous materials. However, few research studies have been reported on the fabrication of metal nitride based SCs with high energy densities and just only one report has been found on LIBs based on metal nitride electrodes.145 Therefore, the development of flexible devices based on metal nitride electrodes is highly desirable and prospective research can also be focused on this field.
