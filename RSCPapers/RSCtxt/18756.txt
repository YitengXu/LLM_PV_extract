    , Accepted 3rd May 2017First published on 3rd May 2017AbstractPhotoelectrochemical water oxidation driven by photocatalysts is one of the most effective ways for converting solar energy into fuels and chemicals. However, to date, the solar conversion efficiency using the established photocatalysts is still low. Herein, we report a new strategy for making a class of three-dimensional (3D) BiVO4/Fe-based (Ni1−xFex and Co1−xFex) layered double hydroxide (LDH) interface heterostructures for boosting the photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation performance. Compared with the BiVO4, the BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH interface photoanode exhibits about 4-fold photocurrent enhancement at 1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode and remarkable negative shift (320 mV) of the onset potential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Theoretical calculations reveal that the enhanced photocatalysis for the OER is mainly attributed to the optimal light absorption and the acceleration of electron–hole separation enabled by the strong electronic coupling at the BiVO4/NiFe–LDH interface. The present work first highlights the importance of tuning the light absorption and the separation of carriers using interface engineering in enhancing the solar photocatalytic performance.
Introduction
Solar energy conversion and utilization through photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen is one of the most favorable options for converting solar energy into useable energy.1,2 The overall PEC water splitting includes two half reactions, water reduction and oxidation. The water oxidation is more challenging both thermodynamically and kinetically, since it proceeds via a multistep proton-coupled electron transfer. This makes it be considered as the rate determining step in the PEC water splitting.3 To date, numerous metal oxides, such as TiO2,4–7 α-Fe2O3,8–10 WO3,11–13 and BiVO4 (ref. 14–17), have been used as photoanodes for enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from water oxidation. Among these, BiVO4 is one of the most promising metal oxide photoanode materials with an appropriate valence band position for the OER.18,19 However, its inherent drawbacks, such as sluggish charge mobility and fast charge recombination, lower its efficiency to an unsatisfactory level. Therefore, representative oxygen evolution co-catalysts (OECs), such as RuO2,20 CoOx,21,22 cobalt–phosphate (Co–Pi),23,24 cobalt–borate (Co–Bi)25 and nickel–borate (Ni–Bi),26 have been introduced onto BiVO4 photoanodes to improve their PEC performance. However, these co-catalysts can only facilitate water oxidation kinetics, leading to limited improvement in photocatalysis. Given that PEC water oxidation involves a sequence of multiple steps, including light harvesting, charge generation and transportation, and surface reactions,18 it is highly desirable to design a new class of photoelectrode composites that not only can promote the surface reaction kinetics, but also can enhance the light absorption and charge transfer at the photocatalysis/OEC interface. Achieving such a target using interfacial tuning of photocatalysts is one of the best ways for boosting PEC water oxidation, but still a great challenge.
Herein, we report a simple electrodeposition method for making a {010} and {110} facet-dominated BiVO4/Fe-based (Ni1−xFex and Co1−xFex) layered double hydroxide (LDH) interface heterostructure for boosting the PEC water oxidation performance. The as-obtained BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH displays 4 times higher photocurrent at 1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), a cathodic onset potential shift of 320 mV, and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of around 4-fold improvement for PEC water oxidation than bare BiVO4. The similar results were observed from the BiVO4/Co0.5Fe0.5–LDH photoelectrode. The theoretical calculations reveal that the greatly improved photoelectrocatalytic performance of BiVO4/LDH is attributed to the facts that (i) Fe-based LDHs with a narrow bandgap can enhance light absorption; (ii) the metallic characteristic of the BiVO4/LDH phase-interface can facilitate the charge separation, and (iii) the LDHs as an effective OEC can increase the OER kinetics at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.
Experimental
Synthesis of BiVO4
The fabrication of a BiVO4 seed layer on a FTO glass substrate was performed using a previously reported method.14 For a typical synthesis procedure to prepare the BiVO4 film,27 Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (0.10 mmol) and NH4VO3 (0.10 mmol) were dissolved in 8 mL of 2.0 M HNO3 and 8 mL of 2.0 M NaOH aqueous solution, respectively. These two solutions were mixed together and transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a capacity of 25 mL. Then, the pre-fabricated BiVO4 seed layer on the FTO substrate was immersed into the reaction solution, and reacted at 150 °C for 24 h. After the hydrothermal reaction, the BiVO4 coated FTO substrate was washed with de-ionized (DI) water and calcined at 450 °C for 3 h in air.
Synthesis of BiVO4/Fe-based LDH core/shell nanostructures
The BiVO4/Fe-based LDH core/shell nanostructures were prepared via a fast electrodeposition method.28 Typically, the BiVO4 film, Pt foil and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrolyte for the electrosynthesis of Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH was obtained by dissolving Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.10 M) and Fe(SO4)2·7H2O (0.10 M) in 30 mL of DI water with a continuous N2 flow to prevent the oxidation of Fe2+. The potentiostatic electrodeposition was carried out at −1.00 V vs. the SCE for 20 s. The resulting BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH core/shell nanostructure was rinsed thoroughly with DI water. To optimize the composition of the Ni1−xFex–LDH deposition, the total moles of Ni2+ and Fe2+ in the electrolyte were maintained at 0.20 M while the molar ratio of Ni2+ and Fe2+ was systematically varied. The Co1−xFex–LDH arrays were prepared via the same method by replacing Ni(NO3)2·6H2O with Co(NO3)2·6H2O.
Characterization
XRD was carried out with a DX2700 operating at 40 kV and 30 mA equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The morphology and structure of the samples were characterized by using a FEI Magellan 400 FESEM. TEM and HRTEM images were obtained using a JEM-2100F electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The chemical composition was investigated by XPS using an ESCALAB 250XL electron spectrometer with monochromatic 150 W Al Kα radiation. The UV-vis absorbance spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer using BaSO4 as the reference.
Photoelectrochemical measurement
The PEC performance was evaluated using an IviumStat Electrochemical Workstation (Ivium Technologies) in a three-electrode cell with Pt foil as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The as-prepared BiVO4/Fe-based LDH films with an exposed area of 1 cm2, which were sealed with epoxy, were used as the photoanodes. A 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution purged with N2 was used as the electrolyte. A PLS-SXE 300C Xe arc lamp (Perfect Light) with an AM 1.5G filter was used for the simulated solar illumination. The power intensity of the incident light was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 by using a power meter with a thermal sensor (Thor Labs S302C). Photocurrent–time curves were measured under a constant bias of 1.23 V vs. the RHE. Photocurrent–potential characteristics were recorded with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 by scanning the potential in the anodic direction. Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was measured under monochromatic irradiation from a Xe lamp. IPCE was calculated using the equation (IPCE = [1240 × (Jlight − Jdark)]/(Pλ × λ) × 100%), where Jlight and Jdark are the measured photocurrent and dark current obtained at 1.23 V vs. the RHE, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in the frequency range of 105 to 10−2 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV at the open circuit potential. Impedance data were fitted using ZSimpWin software. The solar energy conversion efficiency (η) of the photoanodes was calculated by using the photocurrent–potential curves under AM 1.5G illumination using the following equation: η = ((1.23 − ERHE) × (Jlight − Jdark)/Plight) × 100%, where ERHE is the applied bias potential vs. the RHE, and Plight (100 mW cm−2) is the power density of AM 1.5G. The measured potentials vs. the Ag/AgCl reference electrode were converted to the RHE according to the Nernst equation (ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + 0.1976), where EAg/AgCl is the applied potential vs. Ag/AgCl and 0.1976 V is the standard potential of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode at 25 °C.
Computational models and methodology
We performed first-principles calculations based on spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT). The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) is used to solve Kohn–Sham equations with periodic boundary conditions and a plane wave basis set.29–32 Electron-ion interactions were described by projector-augmented wave (PAW) potentials;29 exchange and correlation energies were also calculated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof form of the spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE).33 We used a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV for all calculations, and the convergence threshold was set to 10−5 eV in energy and 10−3 eV Å−1 in force, and cell dimensions along the z direction were 15 Å to avoid interaction between layers. In order to improve the description of the electronic structure of NiFe–LDH and BiVO4 systems, we adopt a DFT+U method with U values of 5.5, 6.5, and 4.5 eV for Fe, Ni and V atoms, respectively. Monkhorst–Pack k-point grids (4 × 4 × 1) are employed for the Brillouin zone integration for all the structures, using approximately the same k-point density for reciprocal cells of different sizes. Bulk NiFe–LDHs (the atomic number ratio of nickel and iron is 1:1 and 3:1) are built with the space group of  3 mL. Carbonate anions are put into the interlayer space of NiFe–LDH to keep the model neutral. The (001) and (110) surfaces of NiFe–LDH are cleaved, containing two layers of LDH matrices and one layer of carbonates. By optimizing the pure BiVO4 structure, we got the lattice parameters as follows: a = 5.1775, b = 11.7611, c = 5.1451 Å and β = 90°.34–36 The interface adhesion energies are obtained according to the following equation: Ead = EBiVO4/NiFe–LDH − EBiVO4 − ENiFe–LDH, where EBiVO4/NiFe–LDH, EBiVO4, and ENiFe–LDH represent the total energies of the BiVO4/NiFe–LDH interface system, pure BiVO4, and NiFe–LDH, respectively. Then, the radicals O, OH, and OOH are put onto NiFe–LDH, BiVO4 (010) and (110) surfaces, being the model of *O, *OH and *OOH.
Results and discussion
As shown in Scheme 1, a three-step approach was developed for the fabrication of BiVO4/Fe-based LDH core/shell heterostructure films. First, the BiVO4 seed layer was synthesized on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass by a spin-coated method and subsequent annealing treatment.14 Subsequently, the BiVO4 crystals exposed with {010} and {110} facets were assembled on FTO by a seed layer mediated hydrothermal approach.27,37,38 After electrodeposition in aqueous solution with (Ni2+, Fe2+) or (Co2+, Fe2+) cations,28 the Fe-based LDH arrays can be anchored onto the {010} and {110} facets of BiVO4 crystals. The hydrogen bonds between the abundant hydroxyl groups on LDH and the BiVO4 crystals allow the firm interaction between the LDH shell and the BiVO4 core which led to the formation of a phase-interface.39 The composition of Ni/Fe or Co/Fe in LDH arrays can be adjusted by changing the molar ratio of cations in the electrodeposition solution.

The corresponding field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images are presented in Fig. 1. The BiVO4 seed layer with a worm-like morphology was coated on the FTO glass uniformly (Fig. 1a). After hydrothermal treatment, large BiVO4 crystals with a regular decahedron shape and smooth surface were observed to grow along the BiVO4 seed layer, which have a length of approximately 1.0–3.0 μm and a thickness of approximately 0.5–1.0 μm (Fig. 1b). As illustrated in Fig. 1c–f, the electrodeposited Ni1−xFex–LDH arrays with an average thickness of 20–30 nm are uniformly dispersed on the surface of the BiVO4 film. The hierarchical LDH is typically permeable to the electrolyte that enables a convenient charge transfer to the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface where the OER occurs.40 Using the same method, the Co1−xFex–LDH arrays were also deposited on the BiVO4 film. As shown in Fig. S1,† hierarchical Co1−xFex–LDH arrays are firmly attached on the large BiVO4 crystal surface homogeneously.

The crystal structure of the samples was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 2a and b). Apparently, all of the diffractions were indexed to monoclinic scheelite BiVO4 (m-BiVO4, JCPDS 14-0688). However, no typical diffraction peaks of NiFe or CoFe–LDH are observed in the XRD patterns of the BiVO4/Fe-based LDH film due to the low amount and poor crystallization of the LDH layer. However, as shown in Fig. S2,† when the electrodeposition time increased to 1000 s, a small peak corresponding to the (003) plane of the NiFe–LDH can be observed. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results further confirm the presence of both Ni and Fe in the BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH film (Fig. 2c and d). The Ni 2p3/2 (855.8 eV) and Ni 2p1/2 (873.4 eV) peaks with two satellite bands indicate that Ni is in the Ni2+ oxidation state. Fe 2p1/2 (725.0 eV) and Fe 2p3/2 (712.2 eV) accompanied by a satellite band indicates the existence of the Fe3+ state.41,42 The atomic ratio of Ni and Fe is determined to be about 1.

From the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 3a), the dispersion of Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH arrays on the BiVO4 surface is confirmed, showing the tight contact between Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH and BiVO4. Fig. 3b and c show the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH. The lattice spacing of 0.47 nm agrees well with the spacing of the (−110) lattice planes of m-BiVO4. The diffraction spots of the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Fig. 3b) can be indexed to the (−110) reflection of single crystalline m-BiVO4, being in good agreement with the HRTEM result. Furthermore, the diffraction rings in the SAED pattern belong to the NiFe–LDH phase. The fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.24 nm and 0.27 nm are assigned to the (012) and (101) planes of Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH (Fig. 3c).28 The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images show uniform signals for Bi, V, O, Ni, and Fe elements (Fig. 3d and S3†), demonstrating the homogeneous distribution of Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH on the BiVO4 film. Moreover, the mapping images further confirm the core/shell structure of the BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH composite.

The BiVO4/Fe-based LDH thin films were used as photoanodes for PEC water oxidation measurement through a three-electrode electrochemical system in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution under simulated solar illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). As shown in Fig. 4a, a fast and reproducible photocurrent response was obtained in four cycles of switching light on and off. When the photoanodes were exposed to incident light, an anodic photocurrent spike was observed and then gradually decreased to a steady state plateau with time. This is associated with the sudden generation of charge carriers and the subsequent recombination process.43–45 Compared with the pure BiVO4 photoanode (0.30 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the RHE), a huge enhancement in photocurrent density is observed for the BiVO4/Ni1−xFex–LDH photoanodes. The photocurrent density increases with increasing the content of Fe3+ in the Ni1−xFex–LDH. The photoanodes using Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH show the highest photocurrent densities of 1.21 mA cm−2 (1.23 V vs. the RHE). However, the photocurrent densities decrease with a further increase of the Fe3+ content, but it is still higher than that of the pure BiVO4 photoanode.

(c) IPCE measured at 1.23 V vs. the RHE under monochromatic light irradiation. (d) Nyquist plots of the EIS measured at the open circuit potential under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination. Inset presents the plot enlarged over the high frequency range. All measurements were taken in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution. 
To further evaluate the performance of PEC water oxidation, we compared the onset potential (Eonset) of photocurrent. Fig. 4b shows chopped light photocurrent–potential response curves of BiVO4 and BiVO4/Ni1−xFex–LDH photoanodes. This shows the sensitive response of photocurrent upon turning on or off the light. All the BiVO4/Ni1−xFex–LDH photoanodes show overall higher photocurrent density in the same bias potential range than the pure BiVO4 photoanode. With decreasing the molar ratio of Ni/Fe in Ni1−xFex–LDH, the photocurrent density increases gradually and BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH shows the highest photocurrent density. However, the photocurrent density decreases with a further increase of the Fe3+ content, which is consistent with the photocurrent–time curves (Fig. 4a). This indicates that the effective separation of the photo-induced charge carrier took place after creating the BiVO4/Ni1−xFex–LDH interface heterostructure. The anodic photocurrent was generated on the BiVO4 photoanodes at around 0.47 V vs. the RHE and gently increased above this potential (inset of Fig. 4b). A remarkable cathodic shift (320 mV) of the Eonset for the BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH photoanode (0.15 V vs. the RHE) is observed, suggesting that the OER kinetics are improved obviously. The creation of the BiVO4/Ni1−xFex–LDH interface can facilitate the charge transfer across the BiVO4/LDH interface effectively and allow a more facile pathway for the holes to quickly take part in the water oxidation process at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. Previous studies on the PEC performance of LDH-based photoanodes are listed in Table S1.† These reported LDH/photoanode systems record only 1–3 times photocurrent increases for the bare photoanode, but this work records a 4 times increase, along with a comparable Eonset cathodic shift.
The relationship between the PEC activity and the wavelength of the incident light was investigated by IPCE. Fig. 4c shows the IPCE spectra of the BiVO4 and BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH photoanodes measured in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution at a constant applied potential of 1.23 V vs. the RHE under monochromatic irradiation. For all of the photoanodes, the photoresponses are observed from 380 nm to 520 nm, being in agreement with their UV-vis absorbance spectra (Fig. S4†). In the absence of NiFe–LDH, the IPCE of BiVO4 is about 9.0%, whereas the IPCE response of BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH shows a remarkable enhancement to 37.5%. The IPCE results confirm that the interface of Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH with BiVO4 can enhance the harvesting of the photons for the PEC.
The charge transfer at the photoanodes and water oxidation kinetics at the interface of the photoanode/electrolyte were evaluated by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots. As shown in Fig. 4d, the measured data are the dots with different symbols, while the solid lines are the fitted results using the provided equivalent circuit (Fig. S5†). The measured data are fitted very well. The impedance spectrum enlarged over the high-frequency region reveals the occurrence of a well-defined semicircle (inset of Fig. 4d). This arc is associated with the charge transfer process at the photoanode. The value of electron transfer resistance (Rt) at the photoanode obtained from the BiVO4 photoanode is 690.3 Ω cm2, whereas that of BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH decreases to 571.2 Ω cm2 (Table S2†), revealing that the decrease of interfacial charge transfer resistance at the photoanode. Moreover, the arc in the low-frequency range is associated with the charge transfer process at the interface of the photoanode/electrolyte.46 As shown in Table S2,† the electron transfer resistance (Rss) values are 108.2 kΩ cm2 and 40.87 kΩ cm2 for the BiVO4 and BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH photoanode, respectively. This indicates that Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH can effectively promote the charge transfer across the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface and improve water oxidation kinetics on the photoanode surface.47,48
In addition, photocurrent–time curves (Fig. S6a†) were obtained at 1.23 V vs. the RHE to evaluate the long-term stability of the BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH photoanode. The photocurrent density shows a slight decrease (90% and 80% remained) for BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH and BiVO4 after continuous illumination for 12 h, respectively. After illumination, the BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH electrode was further characterized by SEM, XRD and XPS measurements. As shown in Fig. S6b–d,† it can be seen that no obvious changes are observed in comparison with the initial status, suggesting its good durability.
In addition, this interface configuration is also effective for enhancing the performance of BiVO4/Co1−xFex–LDH photoanodes. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, a rapid photocurrent response was also obtained from BiVO4/Co1−xFex–LDH photoanodes under chopped light illumination. A huge improvement in photocurrent density is observed for all the BiVO4/Co1−xFex–LDH photoanodes in comparison with the pristine BiVO4. The photocurrent density increases with decreasing the molar ratio of Co/Fe in the Co1−xFex–LDH, and the BiVO4/Co0.5Fe0.5–LDH photoanode shows the highest photocurrent density of 1.05 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the RHE. Unfortunately, with a further increase of the Fe3+ content, the current density decreases. These results are in good agreement with the variation of photocurrent density for BiVO4/Ni1−xFex–LDH photoanodes. The Eonset of the BiVO4/Co0.5Fe0.5–LDH photoanode has a remarkable negative shift of 290 mV compared with that of BiVO4 (inset of Fig. 5b). The values of Rt and Rss for BiVO4/Co0.5Fe0.5–LDH obtained from the EIS plot are 610.5 Ω cm2 and 58.46 kΩ cm2 (Fig. S7 and Table S2†), which are also lower than those of the bare BiVO4 photoanode. Moreover, the slopes of the curves of the BiVO4/Fe-based LDH photoanodes are much higher than those of the pure BiVO4 (Fig. 5c). The slope corresponds to the resistance of contact between the photoanode and the electrolyte.49 This result indicates that BiVO4/Fe-based LDH photoanodes have lower resistance. Besides, the solar energy conversion efficiency (η) of each photoanode (Fig. 5d) is plotted as a function of applied potential, using the photocurrent–potential curves shown in Fig. 5c. The bare BiVO4 photoanode only achieved a maximum η of 0.06% at 1.0 V vs. the RHE, indicating that the BiVO4 photoanode operated most effectively in the case of PEC water splitting around 1.0 V vs. the RHE. The photocurrent of both BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH and BiVO4/Co0.5Fe0.5–LDH photoanode was obtained at lower applied potential compared with the BiVO4. The highest η is 0.31% for BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH and 0.27% for the BiVO4/Co0.5Fe0.5–LDH photoanode.

All measurements were taken in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution. 
Theoretical calculations were carried out to gain further insights into the nature of the PEC water oxidation process by elucidating the electronic structure and Gibbs free energies of the OER. As the {010} and {110} facets of BiVO4 are predominantly exposed crystal facets,15,27,37,38 both (010) and (110) facets of BiVO4 were chosen for building a layered interface with the NiFe–LDH surface, respectively (Fig. 6a and Scheme S1†).50–54 This will introduce a lattice mismatch below 5%. The well-matched interface is formed by pronounced hydrogen bonding of the terminal oxygen atom in the BiVO4 (010) or (110) surface with hydrogen atoms in the LDH surface. After geometry optimization of the BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH interface, the adhesion energies between the BiVO4 (010) or (110) surface and LDH surface were found to be as low as −4.16 eV and −3.51 eV, respectively, indicating a strong driving force for the formation of the BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH interface. To better understand the mechanism of the interface interaction of the BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH core/shell nanostructure, it is meaningful to further investigate the interface electronic structure. From the total density of states (DOS) (Fig. 6b), the bandgap value of BiVO4 (010) is about 2.15 eV, close to the value obtained from the UV-vis absorbance spectra (Fig. S4†). We can see that the bandgap value of NiFe–LDH decreases with increasing the content of Fe3+ in the Ni1−xFex–LDH (1.64 eV for Ni0.75Fe0.25–LDH and 1.46 eV for Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH) (Fig. S8a†). The band gap narrowing of NiFe–LDH leads to enhanced light absorbance and electrical conductivity, which is beneficial to the PEC performance, being in accordance with the photocurrent density results (Fig. 4a). What's more, the BiVO4/NiFe–LDH interface displays a typical metallic property,55 when the Ni0.5Fe0.5 is introduced on the surface of BiVO4 (Fig. 6b and S8c†). The partial DOS reveals that Ni-3d and Fe-3d are responsible for the closure of the bandgap. The strong electronic coupling results in convenient photo-generated charge transfer from BiVO4 to NiFe–LDH at the connected interface.

(b) The density of states (DOS) of the Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH (001) surface model, BiVO4 (010) surface model, and BiVO4 (010)/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH (001) interface system. (c) Standard Gibbs free energy diagrams for the oxygen evolution reaction over the NiFe–LDH (001) surface and BiVO4 (010) surface. 

Fig. 6c and S9† reveal the standard Gibbs free energy diagrams for the OER. The overpotential of Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH (001), Ni0.75Fe0.25–LDH (001) and BiVO4 (010) for the OER is 0.76 V, 1.68 V, and 2.07 V, revealing that the OER can occur much easier on the NiFe–LDH layer. Additionally, the overpotential value of NiFe–LDH decreases with increasing the content of Fe3+, being in good agreement with the photocurrent density results (Fig. 4a and b). These results show that the interface of NiFe–LDH with the (010) and (110) facets of BiVO4 gives more favored reaction pathways, accounting for better OER performance. Given the discussion above, the reasons for the enhanced PEC water oxidation performance in the BiVO4/Fe-based LDH photoanode are as follows: (i) the Fe-based LDH enhances the light absorbance of the photoanodes; (ii) the metallic interface between Fe-based LDH and BiVO4 facilitates the photo-generated charge transfer from BiVO4 to LDH; (iii) the Fe-based LDH as an effective OEC increases the OER kinetics.
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate that interface engineering of {010} and {110} facet exposed BiVO4/Fe-based LDH layer core/shell nanostructures is an effective strategy in enhancing PEC water oxidation performance. With the creation of the BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH interface, the photocurrent density increased to 1.21 mA cm−2 compared with bare BiVO4 (0.30 mA cm−2) at 1.23 V vs. the RHE under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination. More importantly, the Eonset for the OER exhibits a remarkable negative shift of 320 mV. Similar results were also obtained from the BiVO4/Co0.5Fe0.5–LDH photoanode. The IPCE of the BiVO4/Ni0.5Fe0.5–LDH core/shell nanostructure at 1.23 V (vs. the RHE) increased to about 37.5%, much higher than that of BiVO4. The theoretical calculations show that the photoelectrocatalytic improvement of the BiVO4/Fe-based LDH layer interface nanostructure in the OER comes from the enhanced light absorption by the change of the electronic structures, increased interfacial transfer of photo-generated charge in the photoanode and improved water oxidation kinetics on the photoelectrode surface. This work open a new interface engineering way for the fabrication of more efficient photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting.
