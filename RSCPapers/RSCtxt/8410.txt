These push–pull molecules showed excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperatures over 330 °C, strong optical absorption at 300–700 nm, deep HOMO energy levels (−5.2 to −5.5 eV), and relatively high hole mobilities (4 × 10−4 to 8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). OSCs based on blends of these donors and PC71BM acceptors exhibited power conversion efficiencies of 3.2% to 4%. The effects of oligothiophene bridge length and branch number on absorption, energy level, charge transport, morphology and photovoltaic properties of the molecules were investigated.
1 Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are a promising cost-effective alternative to silicon-based solar cells, and possess low-cost, light-weight, and flexibility advantages.1–3 Polymer photovoltaic materials and devices are rapidly developing, and recently, the encouraging power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 9%4 has been achieved from bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs based on polymer donors and fullerene acceptors. Small molecules offer potential advantages over conjugated polymer counterparts in terms of defined molecular structure, definite molecular weight, high purity, easy purification, easy mass-scale production, and good batch-to-batch reproducibility.5–12 Recently, a number of new small molecule donors and acceptors have been created for OSCs, so far the highest PCEs of solution-processed BHJ OSCs based on small molecular donors and fullerene acceptors are of up to 7%.13,14 Despite the fact that considerable progress has been made in small molecule-based OSCs, small molecule-based OSCs still lag behind the polymer-based devices.
Push–pull structures involving electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups have been widely used for synthesis of photovoltaic molecules.9 This type of molecular architecture can lower the material band gap and extend the absorption spectrum towards longer wavelengths, and meanwhile, the HOMO and LUMO levels can be tuned effectively. Most small molecules which exhibit high PCE values in OSCs have a push–pull molecular structure.13–28 Triphenylamine (TPA) has been regarded as a promising moiety for organic semiconductor materials owing to its good electron-donating and hole-transporting capability.29 TPA-based molecules, including star-shaped and linear molecules with a push–pull structure, have shown promising performance in OSCs.24,28,30–36 Recently, we reported that solution-processed OSCs based on a star-shaped small molecule with TPA as the core gave PCEs of up to 4.3% without any post-treatments, which is the highest reported for solution processed BHJ OSCs based on TPA-based molecules.36
Oligothiophenes, including one, two and three-dimensional conjugated systems, are one of the largest families of organic semiconductors, and have been widely used in OSCs due to their high charge-carrier mobility and good stability.37 Oligothiophene-based molecules, including linear, X-shaped, star-shaped and dendritic structures, have shown promising performance in OSCs.15,38–42 Alkyl cyanoacetate (CA) is a kind of electron withdrawing group with both a cyano group and alkyl chain which can simultaneously induce intramolecular charge-transfer to broaden optical absorption and improve solubility. As a result, alkyl CA end groups have been used in synthesis of linear oligothiophenes for OSCs, which exhibit PCEs of up to 5.8%.14,43–45
In our previous communication, we reported the synthesis of a three-branched TPA–oligothiophene hybrid end capped with CA acceptor groups (S(TPA-3T-CA), Fig. 1) and its application in BHJ OSCs.46 Solution-processed BHJ OSCs based on S(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM without any post-treatments exhibited PCEs as high as 3.60%. Here we design and synthesize a series of one and two-branched push–pull molecules (TPA-1T-CA, TPA-2T-CA, TPA-3T-CA and L(TPA-3T-CA), Fig. 1) with TPA–oligothiophene hybrids as donor groups and alkyl CA as acceptor end groups, and compare with the three-branched molecule S(TPA-3T-CA). We investigated the effects of oligothiophene bridge length and branch number on absorption, energy level, charge transport, morphology and photovoltaic properties of the molecules. The OSCs based on blends of two-branched molecule L(TPA-3T-CA) and PC71BM exhibited PCEs as high as 4.03% without any post-treatments.

2 Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization
These push–pull molecules were synthesized in high yields by simple and facile reactions (Scheme 1). The known intermediates TPA-1T-CHO47 and TPA-2T-CHO48 were synthesized according to the literature procedures. The new intermediate compounds TPA-3T-CHO and L(TPA-3T-CHO) were synthesized through Suzuki coupling reaction between 4-(diphenylamino)phenylboronic acid or bis(N-phenyl-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan -2-yl))aniline and 5′′-bromo-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene-5-carboxaldehyde using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. Straightforward reactions of aldehyde compounds (TPA-1T-CHO, TPA-2T-CHO, TPA-3T-CHO and L(TPA-3T-CHO)) with 2-ethylhexyl cyanoacetate afforded final products TPA-1T-CA, TPA-2T-CA, TPA-3T-CA and L(TPA-3T-CA), respectively. S(TPA-3T-CA)46 was synthesized according to the literature procedures. All compounds were fully characterized by MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and elemental analysis. At room temperature, TPA-1T-CA is an oil, and the other molecules are solids. These molecules are readily soluble in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane and chloroform at room temperature, owing to solubilizing 2-ethylhexyl substituents. The thermal properties of these compounds were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). These push–pull molecules exhibit good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) over 330 °C in nitrogen (see Fig. S1 in ESI,† and Table 1). The DSC traces of TPA-2T-CA, TPA-3T-CA and L(TPA-3T-CA) show melting peaks at 135–150 °C (see Fig. S2 in ESI,† and Table 1), suggesting that these one- and two-branched molecules are crystalline. However, S(TPA-3T-CA) is amorphous.

2.2 Optical properties
The normalized spectra of optical absorption of these push–pull compounds in dichloromethane solution (10−6 M) are shown in Fig. 2. Compounds TPA-(1–3)T-CA in solution exhibit absorption maxima at 474–494 nm (Fig. 2a and Table 1), as increasing the number of thiophene units and the π-conjugated length of the molecule, the absorption spectra in solution red shift by 20 nm. Meanwhile, one-branched compounds TPA-2T-CA and TPA-3T-CA show maximum extinction coefficients of 3.3–3.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1. The absorption maximum wavelengths (494–498 nm) in solution are almost insensitive to the number of branches among TPA-3T-CA, L(TPA-3T-CA) and S(TPA-3T-CA). Nevertheless, extinction coefficients of L(TPA-3T-CA) (9.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1) and S(TPA-3T-CA) (7.3 × 104 M−1 cm−1) are obviously higher than that (3.3 × 104 M−1 cm−1) of TPA-3T-CA. In thin films, TPA-2T-CA and TPA-3T-CA exhibit similar absorption maxima at 492–494 nm, while L(TPA-3T-CA) and S(TPA-3T-CA) show nearly the same absorption with maxima at 504 nm, which is ca. 10 nm red shift relative to TPA-2T-CA and TPA-3T-CA. The optical band gaps of these molecules estimated from the absorption edge of the thin film are 1.97 to 2.00 eV.

2.3 Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical property of solid TPA-2T-CA, TPA-3T-CA, L(TPA-3T-CA) and S(TPA-3T-CA) was investigated by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method with the film on a glassy carbon working electrode in 0.1 M [nBu4N]+[PF6]− CH3CN solution at a potential scan rate of 100 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, these molecules exhibit irreversible reduction waves and quasi-reversible oxidation waves. The HOMO and LUMO energies (Fig. 3c and Table 1) were estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively, assuming the absolute energy level of FeCp2+/0 to be 4.8 eV below vacuum (oxidation potential of FeCp2+/0versus Ag wire was measured to be 0.48 V). Compound TPA-2T-CA shows the lowest energy levels with a HOMO of −5.45 eV and a LUMO of −3.61 eV. The increase in thiophene number up-shifted HOMO and LUMO energy levels of TPA-3T-CA to −5.32 eV and −3.55 eV, respectively, which can be attributed to the electron-donating property of thiophene units. Compared to one-branched TPA-3T-CA, multi-branched compounds L(TPA-3T-CA) and S(TPA-3T-CA) show relatively higher HOMO (−5.17 to −5.28 eV) and LUMO (−3.34 to −3.43 eV) energy levels. The LUMO gaps (0.3 to 0.6 eV) and HOMO gaps (0.5 to 0.8 eV) between the donors and the acceptor PC71BM are large enough to guarantee efficient exciton dissociation.49 The difference between the HOMO levels of these compounds and the LUMO of PC71BM is very large 1.3–1.6 eV, which could lead to high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of solar cells.

2.4 Hole mobilities
The hole mobility of these push–pull molecules was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TPA-2T-CA, TPA-3T-CA, L(TPA-3T-CA) or S(TPA-3T-CA)/Au (see Fig. S3 in ESI†). Relatively high hole mobilities of 10−4 to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained from these pristine films (Table 1). Compound TPA-3T-CA with a terthiophene unit exhibited a mobility of 2.9 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, one order of magnitude higher than that (3.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of TPA-2T-CA with a bithiophene unit. The increase in thiophene units in these molecules extends π-conjugation and facilitates charge transport in the film; a similar phenomenon was also observed for some oligothiophene-based OSC donors in the literature.50–52 Compared to amorphous material S(TPA-3T-CA), crystalline TPA-3T-CA and L(TPA-3T-CA) exhibited higher mobility. Of all these molecules, compound L(TPA-3T-CA) with two terthiophene branches showed the highest mobility of up to 7.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The high hole mobility (μh) ensures effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes and reduces the photocurrent loss in OSCs.
2.5 Photovoltaic properties
To demonstrate potential applications of these materials in OSCs, we used TPA-2T-CA, TPA-3T-CA, L(TPA-3T-CA) and S(TPA-3T-CA) as electron donors and classical fullerene derivative PC71BM as an electron acceptor, and fabricated BHJ OSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:PC71BM/Ca/Al. Table 2 summarizes VOC, short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE of the devices at different donor–acceptor weight ratios. The devices based on the TPA-2T-CA:PC71BM blend showed very high VOC values of up to 0.98–0.99 V, which is attributed to the lowest HOMO of TPA-2T-CA. The BHJ blend at a donor–acceptor weight ratio of 1:4 gave the best performance: VOC, JSC, FF and PCE reached 0.99 V, 7.64 mA cm−2, 0.42 and 3.18%, respectively (Fig. 4a). Compared to TPA-2T-CA based devices, TPA-3T-CA:PC71BM based devices showed lower VOC and higher JSC, which results from the higher HOMO level and higher hole mobility of TPA-3T-CA, respectively. As a result, the best PCE of TPA-3T-CA:PC71BM based devices can be slightly improved to 3.23% at a weight ratio of 1:3. Due to the strongest optical absorption and the highest hole mobility of compound L(TPA-3T-CA), L(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM (1:2, w/w) based devices exhibited the highest JSC of up to 9.03 mA cm−2 and the highest PCE of 4.03% (Fig. 4a). Compared to the other molecules, the S(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM (1:2, w/w) based devices showed lower VOC and higher FF, finally a moderate PCE value of 3.60% was obtained. The incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the OSCs based on different blend films are shown in Fig. 4b. The OSCs based on the blend films of TPA-2T-CA, TPA-3T-CA, L(TPA-3T-CA) or S(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM showed broad IPCE spectra from 300 to 700 nm with a similar profile. Of these OSCs, the device based on L(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM exhibited the highest IPCE maximum of 57%.

2.6 Blend film morphology
The active layer morphology of OSC devices was examined by an atomic force microscope (AFM) technique in tapping mode. Fig. 5 shows the AFM height and phase images of the blend films of TPA-2T-CA:PC71BM (1:4, w/w), TPA-3T-CA:PC71BM (1:3, w/w), L(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM (1:2, w/w) and S(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM (1:2, w/w) without any post-treatments. The blend films based on TPA-2T-CA, TPA-3T-CA or L(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM exhibited typical cluster structures with many crystalline domains and the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.36–0.65 nm. The domain sizes estimated by cross-section profiles are about tens of nanometers. Differing from these one and two-branched crystalline materials, the amorphous three-branched S(TPA-3T-CA) based blend film exhibited a good interpenetrating network with aggregated domain sizes of ca. 30–40 nm and a relatively rough surface with a RMS roughness of 1.55 nm. This nanoscale interpenetrating network is beneficial to the exciton dissociation and charge carriers transport. As a result, S(TPA-3T-CA) based OSC devices exhibited relatively high FF values. S(TPA-3T-CA) has lower HOMO level than L(TPA-3T-CA), while S(TPA-3T-CA) based devices have lower VOC values than L(TPA-3T-CA) based devices. This abnormal phenomenon may be attributed to the big morphological difference between S(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM and L(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM films.53,54

3 Conclusions
We have designed and synthesized a series of one, two and three-branched push–pull molecules (TPA-1T-CA, TPA-2T-CA, TPA-3T-CA, L(TPA-3T-CA) and S(TPA-3T-CA)) with TPA–oligothiophene hybrids as donor groups and alkyl CA as acceptor end groups. These push–pull molecules showed excellent thermal stability and solubility in common organic solvents, strong optical absorption in the visible region, deep HOMO energy levels, relatively high hole mobilities, and good photovoltaic performance. The oligothiophene bridge length and branch number exert impacts on state, absorption, energy level, charge transport, morphology and photovoltaic properties of the molecules. The smallest molecule TPA-1T-CA is an oil, the biggest molecule S(TPA-3T-CA) is an amorphous solid, while medium-sized molecules TPA-2T-CA, TPA-3T-CA and L(TPA-3T-CA) are crystalline. The two and three-branched molecules exhibit red-shifted and stronger absorption, up-shifted HOMO and LUMO levels relative to the one-branched molecules. Molecules TPA-3T-CA, L(TPA-3T-CA) and S(TPA-3T-CA) with terthiophene units exhibit one order of magnitude higher mobilities than TPA-2T-CA with bithiophene units. The blends of TPA-2T-CA, TPA-3T-CA, or L(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM exhibit crystalline domains with a smooth surface, while the S(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM blend film exhibits a good interpenetrating network with aggregated domains and a relatively rough surface. Relative to one-branched molecules TPA-2T-CA and TPA-3T-CA, the two and three-branched molecules L(TPA-3T-CA) and S(TPA-3T-CA) exhibit higher PCEs in OSCs, which is attributed to their red-shifted and stronger absorption as well as high mobilities. In particular, the two-branched molecule L(TPA-3T-CA) affords the highest JSC of up to 9.03 mA cm−2 and the highest PCE of 4.03%, due to the strongest optical absorption and the highest hole mobility.

Synthesis of L(TPA-3T-CHO)
To a three-necked round bottom flask were added bis(N-phenyl-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl))aniline (124 mg, 0.25 mmol), 5′′-bromo-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene-5-carboxaldehyde (213 mg, 0.6 mmol), toluene (15 mL), and potassium carbonate aqueous solution (2 M, 7.5 mL). The mixture was deoxygenated with nitrogen for 30 min. Pd(PPh3)4 (25 mg, 0.022 mmol) was added under nitrogen. The mixture was refluxed for 12 h and then cooled down to room temperature. Water (50 mL) was added and the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (2 × 200 mL). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered. After removing the solvent from filtrate, the residue was washed by ethyl acetate and filtered. The crude product (168 mg, 85%) was obtained as an orange solid and was used directly for the next step reaction without further purification due to poor solubility of this compound in common solvents. MS (MALDI): m/z 793.2 (M+).

Fabrication and characterization of photovoltaic cells
Photovoltaic cells were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TPA-2T-CA, TPA-3T-CA, L(TPA-3T-CA) or S(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM/Ca/Al. The patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass (sheet resistance = 30 Ω □−1) was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol, and treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Jelight Company, USA) for 30 min. A thin layer (30 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P VP AI 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 150 °C for 30 min. A chloroform solution of a blend of TPA-2T-CA, TPA-3T-CA, L(TPA-3T-CA) or S(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM was subsequently spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a photosensitive layer (ca. 80 nm). The thickness of the photosensitive layer was measured using an Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. Calcium (ca. 25 nm) and aluminium (ca. 60 nm) layers were subsequently evaporated onto the surface of the photosensitive layer under vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) to form the negative electrode. The active area of the device was 4 mm2. The J–V curve was measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. A xenon lamp coupled with AM1.5 solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured using a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 500 W xenon lamp.
