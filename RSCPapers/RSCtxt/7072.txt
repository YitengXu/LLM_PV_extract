    , Accepted 5th September 2022First published on 6th September 2022AbstractThe toxicity of Pb in halide-based hybrid perovskite materials stands in the way of their more extensive use, despite their excellent optical properties, high stability and very good photoconversion efficiency. The presented work focuses on addressing the toxicity issues in 2D perovskites. We use 5-ammonium valeric acid (AVA) as an organic spacer and partially or completely eliminate Pb by Sn and apply first principles-based density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine the properties of these systems. Structural insights are gained, which predict the major changes in the inorganic framework including the metal–halide bond length and the bridging angle between two octahedral configurations. The replacement of Pb by Sn leads to a drastic reduction of the electronic band gap from 1.84 to 1.04 eV. Increasing the Sn content results in Sn–I bonds being stronger than the Pb–I bonds, which entails strong s–p coupling. The calculated effective masses of excitons decrease by up to ∼23% in the case of lead-free perovskites, which can be attributed to the more dispersive band edges due to stronger s–p coupling. The reduction of the effective masses of the charge carriers and the electronic band gap results in high electrical conductivity for the AVA2(MA)Sn2I7 2D perovskite structure. The three structures compared, where AVA2(MA)XI7 (X = Pb2, PbSn, Sn2) exhibit excellent thermoelectric power factors, which suggests promising applications for heat energy conversion. Moving toward lead-free 2D perovskites, the real part of the dielectric constants enhances, which may limit the radiative recombination of charge carriers. Furthermore, reducing the bandgap values by the substitution of Sn results in a red-shift in the edge of the absorption coefficients. Using the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) model, the best efficiencies of 32.20 and 30.08% are achieved for the AVA2(MA)PbSnI7 and AVA2(MA)Sn2I7 structures. The comparison of all three structures demonstrates that lead-free 2D perovskites are very good candidates for highly efficient solar energy conversion.
1. Introduction
Within a short time, halide-based perovskites have become very promising candidates for applications in solar energy conversion due to their excellent properties such as tunable bandgap, high exciton lifetime, high diffusion length and carrier mobilities as well as high absorption coefficients.1–5 Competing with silicon-based solar cells, halide-based perovskites achieved 25.2% power conversion efficiency (PCE) with improved stability.6 Despite their excellent PCE, the commercialization of perovskite solar cells is still hindered due to the still not sufficient stability of the light absorber material and also by the toxicity caused by the Pb present in the octahedral structure of perovskites. In recent years, the stability has been significantly improved when using two-dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskite materials, where the degradation of PCE drops remarkably compared to their three-dimensional (3D) structures.7–10 The hydrophobic nature of the organic cation and van der Waals interactions of inorganic layers and organic cations in 2D perovskites increases the stability against moisture.10–13 The electronic bandgap has been significantly reduced by increasing the number of inorganic layers, and ultimately reached the values of the 3D structure, which however is less stable than low-dimensional perovskites.14,15 The crystal structure of 2D perovskites can be varied influencing electronic as well as optical properties, which makes them potential candidates for high-performance solar energy harvesting.16–18
In spite of the now achieved excellent stability and performance, the toxicity of lead still limits the large-scale development of solar energy applications of 2D halide-based hybrid perovskite materials. Lead is a hazard to the environment and human health, which made researchers look for Pb-free solutions19,20 by possible replacement through tin (Sn), germanium (Ge), bismuth (Bi), copper (Cu), silver (Ag), gold (Au), etc.21–27 Particularly, tin-based halide perovskites exhibit an electronic bandgap in the ideal range of the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit of the PCE, which makes them promising candidates for applications in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.28,29 Moreover, a recent theoretical investigation by Filippetti et al. suggests that a lower bandgap and smaller cross-section near the absorption onset results in an excellent PCE of 32.3% for bulk tin-based perovskites under the illumination of air-mass 1.5 global spectra (AM1.5G).30
Halide perovskites with metal elements other than Pb relinquish the desired range of properties and the performance of solar cells.31 Apart from many favorable features, recent research on lead-free perovskite reports that the electrons are strongly trapped between Sn atoms and the charge-carrier mobility reduces due to an increase in the stability of bipolaronic states in Sn-based halide perovskites.32 Furthermore, an Sn-based perovskite shows reduced air stability due to the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ states.29 However, recent work on 2D Sn-based perovskites with phenylethylammonium (PEA) shows that the organic spacer creates a blockage reducing the oxidation process of Sn, which significantly improves the stability and performance.33 Also, 2D spacer cation substitution has a significant impact on the performance of light-emitting diodes.34 Furthermore, combined experimental and theoretical work on tin–lead cocation perovskite structures demonstrates a mismatch in the energy levels, which results in the bending of the electronic bandgap by changing the Sn content.35
Recently, Wei et al. reported that the surface-defect passivation in a MAPbI3 perovskite structure by 5-ammonium valeric acid (AVA) iodide leads to a reduction of the charge carrier recombination, which further gives rise to an enhancement of the stability along with 20.05% PCE.36 Moreover, Ashari-Astani et al. showed that the AVA-based 2DRP phase of perovskite exhibits additional interactions between the carbonyl heads group of the same AVA molecules, which results in the enhancement of the thermal stability of 2D perovskites.37
In spite of these promising results, from a literature survey, one finds that AVA-based 2D perovskites as a Pb-free material are largely unexplored in terms of their fundamental electronic and optical properties important for judging their usefulness for efficient solar energy conversion. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this group of 2D perovskites has not been explored for its thermoelectric properties, despite their excellent electronic bandgap range and thermal stability.37 Therefore, the presented work focuses on the impact of the organic linker and the replacement of Pb through Sn on the structural, electronic, optical, and thermoelectric properties of AVA-based 2D perovskite materials.
2. Methodology
First-principles-based density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been utilized to determine the structural and electronic properties under the Quantum Espresso code.38 The energy minimization of the 2D perovskite structures has been performed using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional along with Grimme's D2 dispersion correction39 The ground state energy of the 2D perovskite structures has been calculated with the full relativistic Vanderbilt pseudopotential.40 The Brillouin zone (BZ) was sampled with a Monkhorst–Pack grid of 4 × 1 × 4 and the plane waves were expanded up to 100 Ry. Electronic minimizations of the system were achieved through the iterative solution of the Kohn–Sham equation with the energy convergence criteria of 10−8 Ry. Furthermore, ionic minimization was achieved with the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method with an energy and force convergence of 10−4 Ry and 10−3 eV Å−1, respectively.41 The calculated electronic band energies were further utilized to obtain the thermoelectric and optical properties of the 2D perovskite structures. The electronic parts of the thermoelectric coefficients such as the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity have been calculated using the Boltzmann transport theory, which is implemented in the BoltzTrap code.42 For the analysis of the optical properties, the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constants as a function of photon energy have been calculated from occupied and unoccupied states of the momentum matrix using the Kramer–Kronig formalism, accomplished in Quantum Espresso.38
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural properties
The considered structures of 2D perovskite consist of two layers of XI6 (X = Pb, Pb and Sn, Sn) with octahedral configurations, where the organic cation CH3NH3+ (MA) is confined inside the octahedral cage. The two layers of inorganic octahedrals are separated by a chain-based long organic spacer; 5-ammonium valeric acid (AVA) contains the carboxyl functional group at one terminal, while another terminal consists of NH3+. Here, we have considered three structures of 2D perovskites, where one structure is the fully Pb-based perovskite, while the second structure consists of 50% of Pb and 50% of Sn as the divalent cation and the third structure exhibits a complete elimination of Pb element from the considered 2D perovskite due to the replacement by Sn. The layered crystal structures of the AVA2(MA)XI7 (X = Pb2, PbSn, Sn2) perovskites are presented in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  (a) Crystal structure of AVA2(MA)XI7 (X = Pb2, PbSn, Sn2). (b) Top view of inorganic layers with the bridging angle between the octahedral structures. 
The crystallographic parameters such as lattice constants and bond lengths are listed in Table 1. The calculated lattice constants and the angle between the crystallographic axis for AVA2(MA)Pb2I7 are in good agreement with a previous report.37 Here, each AVA organic spacer shows the interlinking with the other two AVA spacers through O⋯H bonds and for the case of the AVA2(MA)Pb2I7 structure, the calculated O⋯H bond length is 1.69 Å, which is in good agreement with a previously reported value.37 Surprisingly, the Pb replacement through Sn does not alter the O⋯H bond length. Similarly, changing the number of inorganic layers has also not shown a significant change in the interlinking distance.37 Moreover, the organic spacer AVA did not reveal any significant changes in its tilting angle, thickness and the distance between the organic spacers, which suggests that the substitution of Pb through Sn does not alter the structural characteristics of the organic spacer in 2D perovskites. The hydrogen bond interactions between organic cations and inorganic layered structures play a vital role in the physical properties of perovskite materials. Here, we have identified two important hydrogen bonds between the iodine and NH3+ of MA and the AVA organic spacer cation.

Surprisingly, the Sn substitution in the AVA spacer-based halide perovskite does not affect the hydrogen bond interactions. It should be noted that the AVA organic spacer exhibits a strong binding with the inorganic layer compared to the MA cation. This is attributed to the average hydrogen bond length between the MA cation and inorganic layer being ∼2.72 Å, which is considerably higher than the hydrogen bond length of the AVA spacer. The similar electronic configuration of Pb and Sn as well as the complexity of the structure may result in the unchanged structural characteristics of the organic spacer in all three considered 2D perovskites.
On the other hand, we observed that the majority of the structural changes is due to the replacement of Pb in the inorganic octahedral geometry. Here, the structural characteristics of the inorganic XI6 layers have been determined through the distance between corner-sharing iodine atoms of the octahedral configuration. It seems that the inclusion of the Sn element results in a smaller bond length of Sn–I compared to the Pb–I bonds (see Table 1), attributed to the atomic radius difference between Pb and Sn, which further results in the shrinking of the octahedral configuration. Such a compression of the octahedral structure leads to the modification in the X–I–X (X = Pb/Sn) bridging angle between octahedral geometries along the x–z plane. Therefore, the inorganic layers have been characterized through the angles between X–I–X along the x–z plane of the perovskite structure, which is presented in Fig. 1(b). For the case of AVA2(MA)Pb2I7, the average angle of Pb–I-Pb along the x–z plane is 148.53°, which further gradually increases upon substitution of Sn in the structure and for AVA2(MA)Sn2I7 the same angle is 153.31°, which leads to a more symmetric structure. This reduction in the size of the octahedral structure and increase in the X–I–X bridging angle have a significant impact on the orbital contributions to the electronic and optical properties.
3.2 Electronic properties
2D halide-based hybrid perovskite materials are promising candidates for applications in solar cells, which is mainly due to the large absorption coefficients and very good efficiency. Detailed knowledge of the electronic structure is certainly important for understanding the fundamental properties of the 2D perovskites. Therefore, we have calculated the electronic band structure for Pb and Sn-based 2D perovskites with AVA molecules as organic spacers, which we present in Fig. 2. Two fundamental characteristics, the nature and value of the band gap of the electronic structure, have been evaluated from the electronic band dispersion. Both the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are located at the zone center of the first BZ, which depicts the direct nature of the electronic band gap in all three structures. The substitution of Pb by Sn significantly reduces the value of the electronic band gap from 1.86 to 1.04 eV. At this point, we would like to mention that we have also considered the DFT-D3 method,43 to understand the structural and electronic properties changes in AVA2(MA)Pb2I7. We find that using the DFT-D3 functional, the structural parameters such as lattice constants and crystallographic angles are not significantly deviating from those obtained using the DFT-D2 method. We would also like to point out that the electronic structure calculations result in no significant changes in the nature and value of the electronic bandgap upon inclusion of the DFT-D3 van der Waals functionals (see Fig. 2) compared to the results from DFT-D2 calculations. Therefore, we proceeded with the DFT-D2 method when calculating the optical and thermoelectric properties.
 Fig. 2  Electronic band structures for all three considered structures. (a), (c) and (d) Represent the calculated band structures obtained using the DFT-D2 method. (b) The band structure calculated with the DFT-D3 method for the AVA2(MA)Pb2I7 structure. The Fermi energy is set to 0 eV. The green and dark blue lines represent the valence and conduction bands, respectively. The light-blue region between the bands depicts the band gap. 
This reduction of the band gap can be mainly attributed to the shift of the valence band toward the Fermi level. The AVA2(MA)Sn2I7 2D perovskite exhibits a larger splitting of the valence band along the Γ–Z direction of the BZ compared to the AVA2(MA)Sn2I7 system. This larger splitting in the valence band pushes the VBM toward the Fermi level, which results in the drastic reduction of the band gap in the AVA2(MA)Sn2I7 system. The Pb/Sn elements exhibit lone-pair s electrons due to the presence of the ns2 electronic configuration, while iodine cannot release the s state electrons.44 Therefore, the valence bands near the Fermi level are mainly determined by the I-5p orbitals along with a small contribution of Pb-6s and Sn-5s orbitals in the AVA2(MA)Pb2I7 and AVA2(MA)Sn2I7 system, respectively. For the PbSn system, the conduction bands are formed by the unoccupied p orbitals of the divalent cations (Pb and Sn), with a very small contribution of I-5p orbitals.
The presence of lone-pair s electrons coupled with the p orbitals of the iodine atoms provides s–p coupling, which becomes stronger at the zone center of the BZ and results in the direct band gap of the considered systems. We also note that for the AVA2(MA)PbSnI7 system, the top of the valence bands is completely decoupled from the lower part of the valence bands, which mainly originates from the doping of the AVA2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskite material with Sn. The separated valence bands are mainly determined by the I-5p orbitals, however, the participation of Sn-6s orbitals in the VBM further leads to the decoupling and acts as a doping level in the electronic band structure. This doping level further provides the direct transition of electrons from I-5p and Sn-6s orbitals to the p orbitals of Pb and Sn in AVA2(MA)PbSnI7. A closer view of the projected density of states (PDOS) near the Fermi level reveals that the lone-pair electron occupation from the s states of Pb/Sn is below the VBM, which results in a p–p transition (Fig. 3). The transition pulls the VBM up towards the Fermi level when increasing the Sn content, which is further responsible for the reduction in the band gap.
 Fig. 3  Projected density of states (PDOS) for all three structures (a) AVA2(MA)Pb2I7, (b) AVA2(MA)PbSnI7, and (c) AVA2(MA)Sn2I7. 
Moreover, the distortion in the octahedral structure of the perovskite materials results in a weakening of the Pb–I bonds, which have a significant impact on the electronic band gap.45 Substituting more and more Pb by Sn in AVA2(MA)Pb2I7, results in stronger bonds to iodine, i.e., Sn–I is stronger than Pb–I, which further increases the strength of the s–p coupling and reduces the electronic band gap. The structural distortion of the inorganic layer tunes the band orbital couplings, which further regulates the dispersion of the electronic bands. Therefore, the s–p coupling and the distortion in the inorganic layer have a significant impact on the effective mass of charge carriers.
We have calculated the effective masses of holes and electrons from the electronic band dispersion at the zone center of the first BZ. In the present work, the value of carrier effective masses is strongly dependent on two important aspects, the distortion of the octahedral structure and the hybridization of the orbitals at the VBM and CBM. The calculated effective mass of holes and electrons for all three structures are presented in Table 2.

For AVA2(MA)Pb2I7 we calculated the hole and electron effective masses ( and ) to be 0.085 m0 and 0.068 m0, respectively, which provides a reduced effective mass of 0.038 m0. The substitution of Pb by Sn in AVA2(MA)Pb2I7 leads to a reduction in the carrier effective and excitonic masses. The obtained values for the excitonic masses are in good agreement with the ones found for (CnH2n+1NH3)2PbI4; n = 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.46 For the case of AVA2(MA)PbSnI7 both charge carriers have identical effective masses. The change in the carrier effective masses and the reduced excitonic mass are due to the increase of the bridging angle for Pb-free AVA-based perovskites, which is crucial for the energy band dispersion near the band edges. Additionally, the strong s–p coupling in the Pb-free perovskite results in more dispersive bands near the VBM, which results in the lighter holes upon substitution of Sn. It is to be noted that the complete elimination of Pb by substitution with Sn in the considered 2D perovskite structures provides a ∼23% decrease in the reduced effective mass. This reduction in the effective masses also has an impact on the transport parameters such as electrical conductivity. Additionally, two fundamental characteristics of the electronic structure, p–p transition and direct bandgap, which are fulfilled by all three considered 2D perovskite materials, make them promising candidates for solar-energy harvesting applications.
The excessive amount of heat generated from vehicles, heavy machinery, or industrial instruments can be converted to electricity with the help of thermoelectric power generators. The combination of ultralow thermal conductivity and the excellent charge carrier mobility of halide perovskites led to promising applications toward thermoelectric perspectives.47 Similarly, the heat generated from solar energy can be converted into electricity via solar thermal power generators. Therefore, in our present work, we also focused on the thermoelectric properties of lead-free 2D perovskites. The calculated thermoelectric parameters such as Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power factor as a function of carrier concentration are presented in Fig. 4. Here, the negative and positive values of carrier concentrations are depicted for n-type and p-type charge carriers, respectively. The Seebeck coefficients for all the systems were reduced with increasing the carrier concentration. It can be seen that at a minimal carrier concentration the Seebeck coefficient for both types of charge carriers shows the maximum values. The highest value of the Seebeck coefficient of −2881 μV K−1 is calculated for the AVA2(MA)Pb2I7 system; it decreases systematically to −2361 and −1737 μV K−1 for AVA2(MA)PbSnI7 and AVA2(MA)Sn2I7, respectively, attributed to the band gap reduction. The calculated Seebeck coefficients of all three structures at 300 K are higher than those obtained for other 2D and 3D Pb-free perovskites materials over a large carrier-concentration range.17,18,48 On the other hand, the replacement of Pb through Sn provides higher electrical conductivity at room temperature. In addition, the increasing carrier concentration in all three structures results in a gradual rise in the electrical conductivity. We observe that the hole-modulated electrical conductivity is considerably lower compared to the electron contribution for AVA2(MA)Pb2I7 and AVA2(MA)Sn2I7. This difference in electrical conductivity is attributed to the heavy masses of holes compared to those of the electrons. Furthermore, the band gap reduction in Pb-free 2D perovskite provides the highest electrical conductivity values over the presented carrier concentration range. It should be noted that the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity reveal the opposite nature of values with carrier concentration, which has a significant impact on the thermoelectric power factor of all three structures. The performance of the thermoelectric application is determined by the thermoelectric power factor (PF, S2σ), which is the dominating factor for high output power density and is useful as a source of heat energy from solar energy and industrial machinery.49–53 Up to 5 × 1019 cm−1 negative charge carrier concentration, the thermoelectric power factor of all the structures shows equivalent values, afterwards, it gradually reduces for Sn-substituted 2D perovskite structures, owing to the lower values of the Seebeck coefficients. However, the power factor values in the p-type region of the carrier concentration exhibit very low values compared to the negative charge carriers. Here, the lower values of electrical conductivity result in smaller values of the power factors.

3.3 Optical properties
The optical properties of 2D perovskites have been calculated using the frequency-dependent real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constants. The real part of the dielectric function (ε1) has been calculated from the Kramer–Kronig transformation, while the imaginary part (ε2) is obtained from the momentum operators of the interband matrix elements. The complex dielectric functions are presented in panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 5 in the range from 0 to 10 eV. We found that the dielectric constants along the out-of-plane direction are slightly smaller than those along the in-plane directions. Moreover, increasing the Sn content leads to an isotropic nature of the dielectric constants along the in-plane direction of the structure, where, AVA2(MA)Sn2I7 exhibits equal values of dielectric constants along the x- and z-direction. This might be attributed to the increasing Sn–I–Sn angle compared to the Pb–I-Pb angle in Pb-based perovskites. Therefore, we present the average of the dielectric values as a function of photon energy in Fig. 5. The average static value of the real part of the dielectric constant for AVA2(MA)Pb2I7, AVA2(MA)PbSnI7, and AVA2(MA)Sn2I7 is 2.61, 2.45, and 3.31, respectively. This suggests that the complete elimination of Pb results in an increase of the static dielectric constant (at ω = 0) for the real part. Thus, the highest static refractive index with a value of 1.82 is determined for the AVA2(MA)Sn2I7 system. Furthermore, it can also be observed that the peaks of the ε1 tend toward the lower energy region and exhibit a red-shift, which might increase the static dielectric constant for Sn-based 2D perovskites. A similar observation for the ε1 has also been recently reported for Sn substitution of Pb in a 3D MAPbI3 system.54

Furthermore, the ε1 values also reveal an inverse nature of the optical conductivity, which suggests that in the regions where ε1 exhibits the highest value, the optical conductivity is the smallest. Larger values of ε1 lead to a reduction of the radiative recombination of electron–hole pairs.54 Therefore, AVA2(MA)Sn2I7 might show the smallest probability for the radiative electron–hole recombination process with a high charge carrier screening. The peak of ε1 is observed in the visible photon energy range for all three considered structures; direct transitions are enabled there. Increasing the Sn content up to 100% results in a redshift of ε1, which might be attributed to the reduction of the band gap.
Using the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric functions, we have calculated the refractive index (η; eqn (1)) and the extinction coefficients (κ; eqn (2)). The optical absorption coefficient (α(ω)) can be obtained from κ using eqn (3). (1) (2) (3)
The onset of optical absorption is at 1.80, 1.38, and 0.96 eV as calculated for AVA2(MA)Pb2I7, AVA2(MA)PbSnI7, and AVA2(MA)Sn2I7, respectively. The absorption edge of all three structures is located at slightly lower values than their respective fundamental bandgap. We find that the onset of absorption is in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum for all three investigated systems. Upon substitution of Pb by Sn a red shift can be observed. This redshift and broadening of the absorption spectrum originate from a narrowing of the band gap by shifting the valence and conduction bands.55 The upshifting of the valence band through the decoupling of VBM also enhances the absorption near the visible region. In the visible to UV-Vis region, the AVA2(MA)PbSnI7 structure reveals the strongest absorption coefficient compared to other perovskite systems as can be seen from Fig. 5(c). The DFT-PBE method used in our work for the calculation of the optical spectra could be further improved through advanced excitonic structure methods such as the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) or GW approximation.56–59 However, we believe that we could obtain sufficiently reliable results yielding fundamental trends of properties, which will not be drastically different from those expected from a more advanced approach. Besides this, the large number of atoms (228) per unit cell and the structural complexity of the investigated system would require huge computational power, which is beyond the available computational resources.
A benefit of the Sn-based perovskite materials compared to the Pb-based system is the fundamental band gap, which is near the ideal value of single-junction solar cells. The Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit for the calculation of solar cell efficiency, relies only on the band gap and does not consider the absorption coefficients as well as radiative recombination of the electron–hole of the materials. In a real device, the thickness of the absorbing layer also plays a vital role in the determination of solar cell efficiency. Therefore, the maximum photovoltaic efficiency of the considered structures is calculated using the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) method, proposed by Yu et al.60 The total current can be calculated using the following equation: (4)Here, V, kB, and T represent the potential, Boltzmann constant, and temperature, respectively. Jsc is the short-circuit current density, expressed by the following equation: (5)Here, α(E) and L stand for absorption coefficients at photon energy E and thickness of the absorbing layer, respectively. The reverse saturation current J0 is given by: (6)Here, Ibb, fr−1, and ΔEg present the flux from blackbody radiation, the fraction of radiative recombination current, and the difference between direct and indirect allowed transition gap energy.
Using the above formulation, the SLME is calculated as a function of the thickness of the absorbing layer; the result is presented in Fig. 5(d). One finds that AVA2(MA)Pb2I7 exhibits the lowest efficiency of 25.25%, compared to the considered structures. Reducing the Pb content by 50% (AVA2(MA)PbSnI7) significantly improves the efficiency to 32.20%. After complete elimination of Pb (AVA2(MA)Sn2I7) the efficiency is again slightly reduced to 30.80%, which is still a better value than those reported for other perovskite materials.15,17,18,36 At the same time of course the Pb-related toxicity has been completely removed.
The present work reveals that a partial replacement of Pb by Sn should result in the highest power-conversion efficiency of solar light. The trend of efficiency follows the electronic band gap changes, where the AVA2(MA)PbSnI7 system exhibits a band gap very close to the ideal single-junction solar cell value. Complete elimination of Pb only slightly reduces the efficiency by approx. 1%. Moreover, the elimination of Pb results in lower values of the effective masses and excitonic masses, which also suggests that the considered lead-free 2D perovskite materials would be promising candidates for application in solar cells based on p–i–n junctions.
4. Conclusions
The effect of substitution of Pb by Sn in 2D perovskites with 5-ammonium valeric acid (AVA) as the organic spacer has been systematically investigated. The structural, electronic, optical, and thermoelectric properties have been calculated using density functional and Boltzmann transport theory. The replacement of Pb by Sn results mainly in changes in the structure in the octahedral configuration. The substitution results in the tuning of the electronic band gap. As a consequence of the octahedral distortion through Sn incorporation, the s–p orbital coupling becomes stronger and a reduction of the effective masses of the charge carriers can be observed, which might be beneficial for solar energy and thermoelectric performance. Compared to the Pb-based 2D perovskites, the partially and fully substituted systems, AVA2(MA)PbSnI7 and AVA2(MA)Sn2I7, show a considerably higher power conversion efficiency. We, therefore, conclude that Pb-free 2D halide-based hybrid perovskites are promising candidates for application in photovoltaic devices, thereby avoiding the Pb-related toxicity of the material at the same time.
