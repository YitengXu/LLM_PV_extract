, Accepted 15th July 2013First published on 16th July 2013AbstractUtilizing solar energy for hydrogen generation and water cleaning is a great challenge due to insufficient visible-light power conversion. Here we report a mass production approach to synthesize black titania by aluminium reduction. The obtained sample possesses a unique crystalline core–amorphous shell structure (TiO2@TiO2−x). The black titania absorbs ∼65% of the total solar energy by improving visible and infrared absorption, superior to the recently reported ones (∼30%) and pristine TiO2 (∼5%). The unique core–shell structure (TiO2@TiO2−x) and high absorption boost the photocatalytic water cleaning and water splitting. The black titania is also an excellent photoelectrochemical electrode exhibiting a high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (1.7%). A large photothermic effect may enable black titania “capture” solar energy for solar thermal collectors. The Al-reduced amorphous shell is proved to be an excellent candidate to absorb more solar light and receive more efficient photocatalysis.
Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) as an important semiconductor has attracted extensive interest in the fields of photocatalysis, solar cells and solar thermal collectors (i.e., blue titania), although the wide-band-gap material (∼3.2 eV) captures about 5% of solar energy.1–6 Many investigations have been attempted to enhance visible-light absorption by band structure engineering (e.g. element doping and oxygen deficiency).7–12 Nevertheless, the visible-light power harvest remains insufficient due to little effective light absorption and many carrier-recombination centers.13 Very recently, the hydrogenation of black titania can boost its visible and infrared light absorption and ultraviolet (UV) light photocatalytic activity.14–18 The improved solar absorption is attributed to additional intermediate electronic states induced by hydrogen insertion into the lattice of TiO2.15 However, this absorption enhancement is not very effective for visible-light photocatalysis.9,19–21
Recently, black TiO2 has attracted enormous attention.14–16,19,20,22–26 There are two major preparation methods: (i) high H2-pressure process and (ii) hydrogen gas annealing. The first one is good for photocatalysis but the synthesis is troublesome as in a high-pressure hydrogen atmosphere (20 bar) for five days.15 The second one starting from amorphous TiO2 cannot ensure good photocatalytic activity. Therefore, a facile synthesis is demanded to produce black titania with large solar absorption and excellent photocatalytic activity.
The rapid aluminothermic reduction reaction of TiO2 and elemental aluminum (Al) was used over 50 years ago to produce Al–Ti alloy.27 Inspired by this old technique, a controllable low-temperature synthetic route for black TiO2−x was developed using melted Al as a reductant in an evacuated two-zone vacuum furnace. The Al decreases oxygen partial pressure to provide a kinetic driving force to efficiently reduce TiO2 at a lower temperature (300–500 °C). This method is suitable for the mass production of black TiO2. This black titania has a unique crystalline core–amorphous shell structure (TiO2@TiO2−x). Improved visible and infrared light absorption boosts photocatalysis on both water splitting and waste-water cleaning and enables black titania “capture” solar energy for solar thermal collectors. Furthermore, this oxygen-deficient black titania achieves a rather high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency, which can be applied as an excellent photoelectrochemical electrode.
Experimental section
Preparation of black TiO2−x
TiO2 samples and aluminum were placed separately in a two-zone tube furnace (Fig. S1a†) and then evacuated to a base pressure lower than 0.5 Pa, and the detailed discussion is provided in the ESI.† After that, aluminum was heated at 800 °C, and TiO2 samples were heated at 300 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, and 600 °C for 6 h and 20 h, respectively. The post-annealing treatment was conducted by heating the 500 °C-Al–TiO2−x sample at 800 °C and 900 °C in an Ar atmosphere for 12 h, respectively.
Preparation of H2–TiO2−x
TiO2 samples were placed in a tube furnace and then evacuated to a base pressure of about 0.5 Pa. After that, TiO2 samples were heated at 500 °C for 6 h in H2 flow under atmospheric pressure.
UV light photocatalytic degradation
The UV light photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 sample was evaluated by monitoring the decomposition of methyl orange in an aqueous solution under UV irradiation from a 300 W Hg lamp. A Pyrex glass vessel was used as the photoreactor. The TiO2 sample (100 mg) was mixed with methyl orange solution (100 mL, 0.1 M). After stirring for 30 min in the dark to reach the adsorption equilibrium, the solution was illuminated with a 300 W Hg lamp. The solution was cooled by the water circulating jacket of the reactor to avoid the interference of the solvent evaporation. The concentration of aqueous methyl orange was determined with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer by measuring the peak intensity at 464 nm.
Visible light photocatalytic degradation
The visible light photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 sample was evaluated by monitoring the decomposition of phenol and methyl orange in an aqueous solution under AM 1.5G simulated solar light cut off by a 400 nm filter. The emission spectrum of the simulator is illustrated in Fig. S2.† A Pyrex glass vessel was used as the photoreactor. For the degradation of MO, 100 mg of TiO2 sample was added to 100 mL MO solution with a concentration of 0.1 M. For the degradation of phenol, the concentration of the solution was changed to 0.3 M. After stirring for 30 min in the dark to reach the adsorption equilibrium, the solution was illuminated with the solar simulator. The solution was cooled by the water circulating jacket of the reactor to avoid the interference of the solvent evaporation. The concentration of aqueous phenol was determined with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer by measuring the peak intensity at 270 nm.
Photocatalytic H2 generation
100 mg of photocatalyst loaded with 0.5 wt% Pt was added to an aqueous methanol solution (120 mL, 25%) in a closed gas circulation system. The UV light and visible light irradiation were obtained from a 300 W Hg lamp and an AM 1.5G solar light simulator cut off by a 400 nm filter, respectively. Methanol was used as a sacrificial reagent, and the anodic reaction generating O2 from H2O did not occur. The amount of H2 generated was determined by gas chromatography.
Photoelectrochemical cell (PEC)
PEC measurements were performed in a typical three-electrode potentiostat system (Parstat 2773), in which the TiO2 film on a FTO substrate, a Pt wire, and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. 1.0 M NaOH aqueous solution was used as the supporting electrolyte to maintain the stability of films. A solar simulator (AM 1.5) with a power of 100 mW cm−2 was used as the illumination source. Photocurrent ON/OFF cycles were measured using the same electrochemical workstation coupled with a mechanical chopper.
Results and discussion
Structure features and physical properties
A similar morphology and particle size of the TiO2 nanocrystals before and after the Al reduction were verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These nanocrystals are averagely ∼25 nm in diameter, as shown in Fig. 1a and b. The pristine TiO2 nanocrystals are highly crystallized, as the well-resolved lattice features are shown in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1c). The 6 h-300 °C-Al-reduced nanocrystals display a unique core–shell structure of TiO2@TiO2−x (∼1.5 nm thick disordered surface layer (TiO2−x) coating on a crystalline core of TiO2). The thickness of the disordered layer increases with the Al-reduction temperature in the temperature interval of 300–500 °C, as shown in Fig. 1d and e. (The core–shell TiO2@TiO2−x sample is denoted as TiO2−x from now on for simplification.) When prolonging the Al-reduction time to 20 h at 500 °C, the nanocrystals reveal more imperfections and mostly lose the core–shell structure (Fig. S3†); when increasing the reduction temperature to 600 °C for 6 h, the nanocrystals are highly crystalline without any shells (Fig. S4†).

As illustrated in Fig. 2a, a large amount of black TiO2−x was achieved from one batch by our Al-reduction route. The Al-reduced TiO2−x samples extend the photoresponse from ultraviolet (UV) light to visible and infrared light regions, as shown in Fig. 2b. All these samples possess a band gap value (Eg ∼ 3.2 eV), similar to pristine TiO2, and an add-on absorption shoulder peak at ∼500 nm is imposed onto the cutoff edge. Significantly enhanced absorption occurs from ∼400 nm to the near-infrared region. As mentioned above, the H2 molecule cannot efficiently reduce TiO2 at low temperature (i.e. 500 °C), as confirmed by the HRTEM image shown in Fig. S5.† The wide-spectrum absorption in TiO2−x increases with the reduction temperature (Fig. 2b), which may be correlated with the amount of Ti3+ in the shell. In order to verify the heterogeneous core–shell structure of TiO2−x, the 500 °C-Al-reduced TiO2−x was annealed at 800 °C and 900 °C (Fig. S6†) for 12 h in an Ar atmosphere, respectively. The color of the samples turned from black to gray (800 °C) to white (900 °C) (Fig. S7†) and the light absorption decreased obviously (Fig. S8†). It is presumably due to that the Ti3+ atoms/oxygen vacancies diffuse from shell to core, and the defects as “color centers” are also diluted. The HRTEM image of the 900 °C-annealed sample reveals that the amorphous shell of nanocrystals vanishes after annealing, as shown in Fig. S5b.†

(b) Absorption spectra of TiO2−x samples reduced at different temperatures (300 °C, 400 °C, and 500 °C), the high-pressure hydrogenated black titania (HP-TiO2, from ref. 15), the H2-reduced titania (H2–TiO2−x), and pristine titania (TiO2). 
The oxygen deficiency and amorphous surface of TiO2−x are unambiguously supported by Raman spectroscopy, as six characteristic Raman bands of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 3a. For three black TiO2−x nanocrystals, the strongest Eg mode area at 144 cm−1 amplifies and exhibits a blue shift accompanied by peak broadening, compared with pristine TiO2. As reported in the previous studies,28,29 the shift and broadening of the peaks of TiO2 were ascribed to the crystal domain size and nonstoichiometry. Similar BET specific surface areas for these black TiO2−x (∼42 m2 g−1) and pristine TiO2 (∼43 m2 g−1) confirm that the crystal size of black TiO2−x does not increase after the Al reduction, consistent with the observations of the TEM results discussed above. Thus, the blue shift of the strongest mode at 144 cm−1 and broader linewidth can be attributed to the oxygen vacancies existing in the black TiO2−x (nonstoichiometric). As the X-ray power diffraction (XRD) patterns illustrated in Fig. S9,† the strong diffraction peaks indicate that pristine TiO2 (P25, a mixture of anatase and rutile) and black TiO2−x remain highly crystalline. Nevertheless, the black TiO2−x exhibits a larger linewidth than pristine TiO2, which is derived from oxygen vacancies, as-resulted disorder-induced lattice strains and slightly reduced crystal size.

The plots of magnetic field dependence of magnetization are shown in Fig. 3b. The reduction degree (x) of TiO2−x can be indexed via the magnetic field dependence of the magnetization recorded at 300 K. As an efficacious probe, the field dependence of magnetization indicates that the localized Ti3+ spins play a crucial role in introducing ferromagnetism into TiO2. It is evident that ferromagnetic and paramagnetic moments coexist in all TiO2−x samples, consistent with the reported oxygen-deficient TiO2−x.30,31 When increasing the Al reduction temperature, the sample has stronger magnetization, as shown in the figure, which may be partially correlated with the higher concentration of Ti3+. The saturation magnetization Ms for samples reckoned from the partial hysteresis loops is 0.010 emu g−1 for the 300 °C-reduced sample, 0.017 emu g−1 for 400 °C and 0.025 emu g−1 for 500 °C, respectively. The Ti3+ states in the TiO2−x samples were also investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). A strong EPR signal observed at g = 2.002 is assigned to Ti3+ (Fig. 3c).32 The signal area is correlated with the amount of Ti3+, and a nearly linear correlationn = n0exp(−ΔE/kT),(where n is the molar content of Ti3+, n0 is a fitting coefficient, ΔE is the escape energy of O atoms in Al-reduction, and T is the temperature) between the EPR signal area and the Al-reduction temperature is found, as shown in Fig. 3d. A large amount of Ti3+ (VO) may exist in the TiO2−x samples.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) can provide useful information of chemical binding and valence band position on the sample surface as shown in Fig. 4. Unexpectedly, the spectra of Ti 2p XPS, O 1s XPS and valence band are almost identical for both pristine TiO2 and TiO2−x, which were similarly found in some reported black titania.14 The Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 XPS peaks centered at binding energies of 458.5 and 464.3 eV are typical for the Ti4+–O bonds in TiO2. The single O 1s XPS peak at 529.8 eV for TiO2 can be also assigned to Ti–O bonds. The valence band maxima are estimated by linear extrapolation of the peaks to the baselines, which derives a band edge position of 2.05 eV below the Fermi energy.33 No peak shifts and no additional peaks of Ti3+ found in our TiO2−x sample might be subjected to the detection distance (∼ten atomic layers) for XPS. More possibly, surface metastable sites (surfaced Ti3+ atoms, oxygen vacancies) in loosely packed amorphous shells were easily oxidized by certain components (O2, H2O, etc.) in air. Moreover, no aluminum was detected in the full XPS spectrum (Fig. S10†).

Solar thermal effect
Compared with the solar spectrum shown in Fig. 5a, the Al-reduced TiO2−x samples extend the absorption from ultraviolet (UV) light to visible and infrared light regions. Compared with pristine TiO2 (P25) with little absorption in visible and infrared light regions, the total solar absorption of the 500 °C-reduced TiO2−x sample reaches about 65%. In contrast, the high-pressure hydrogenated black titania (HP–TiO2, data from ref. 15) has a little absorption in the infrared light region (1%) and its total solar absorption is about 30%, as shown in Table S1.† The enhanced solar absorption of black titania was further investigated from the photothermic effect by the irradiation of an AM 1.5G Xe lamp solar simulator. The investigated disks were cold-pressed from TiO2 and 500 °C-reduced TiO2−x powders. As illustrated in Fig. 5b, after being irradiated for 60 s, the temperature of the black TiO2−x disk increased to 37 °C, compared to 28 °C for the pristine TiO2 disk. The accelerated heating rate of the black TiO2−x disk is attributed to larger solar absorption demonstrated by the absorption spectrum in Fig. 5a, resulting in more electron excitation and relaxation and intensified heat emission. Potentially, our black titania can be applied as a solar absorber material for solar thermal collection.

Photocatalytic dye degradation and hydrogen generation
The photocatalytic activities of the TiO2−x samples were evaluated by the decomposition of methyl orange (MO) under UV light irradiation, as shown in Fig. 6. The photocatalytic activity of the TiO2−x samples increased with the Al reduction temperature, which is consistent with the trend of the enhancement of solar absorption. For the 500 °C-reduced TiO2−x, the photodegradation was completed after 12 min, whereas pristine TiO2 had more than 17% residual of MO. The 500 °C-reduced TiO2−x retained good photocatalytic activity in ten cycles, as shown in Fig. S11.† Surprisingly, it exhibited gradually accelerating degradation during the first three cycles, and the final stabilized MO degradation time was 10 min. It is evident that the EPR signal of Ti3+ is weakened when the 500 °C-reduced TiO2−x was irradiated under the UV light in water for 30 min or after the first two cycles of photocatalytic degradation, as shown in Fig. S12.† The localized Ti3+ states and oxygen vacancies have been considered to be the recombination centers of light-induced electrons and holes.4 During the UV irradiation, some Ti3+ sites on the surface are converted into Ti4+ and therefore these recombination centers are reduced, resulting in improved photocatalytic activity. This may also explain why the XPS cannot detect the existence of Ti3+. Furthermore, the Ti3+ species in an amorphous shell–crystalline core structure are much easier to be oxidized to Ti4+ than those in the well-crystallized oxygen-deficient titania. The photocatalysis of the 600 °C-reduced sample is even poorer than that of TiO2 (P25), as shown in Fig. S13.† It indicates that the amorphous shell–crystalline core structure is important to improve the photocatalysis.

The previous MO photocatalytic degradation is simply evaluated to monitor the absorption peak at 464 nm, which is assigned to the n → π* transition related to the azo bond under strong influence of the electron-donating dimethylamino group.34,35 This evaluation only quantitatively indicates the initial step of degradation (breaking the NN bonding), but the complete decomposition of MO also includes breaking down the benzene ring, decomposing to organic micromolecules, and finally being mineralized to inorganic ions (CO32−, NO3−, and NH4+). As shown in Fig. 6a, the original MO possesses two characteristic peaks located at 273 nm and 464 nm, which are attributed to the π → π* transition located in the aromatic rings and the n → π* transition related to the azo bond, respectively.34–36 When applying pristine titania as the catalyst, the absorption peak at 464 nm nearly vanished after 12 min. However, the intensity of the lower absorption peak at 273 nm decreased slowly, indicating the incomplete decomposition of MO. When using 500 °C-Al reduced TiO2−x, MO was completely degraded for both peaks after 12 min, suggesting the high mineralization efficiency. Obviously, our Al-reduced TiO2−x decomposes MO faster and more completely. Total organic carbon (TOC) measurements (Fig. 6d) were conducted to further confirm the efficient mineralization of organic carbon of the photodegradation of MO by 500 °C-Al reduced TiO2−x. Only 26% of TOC still remained in the suspension after 20 min irradiation when MO was completely transformed. The final mineralization yield reached a value of 74%. As a reference, pristine TiO2 had more than 79% residual of TOC after 20 min, indicating that our black titania can degrade organic pollutants more completely.
Visible-light catalytic activity was further investigated to evaluate the visible-light photocatalysis of the TiO2−x samples. As shown in Fig. S14,† the Al-reduced TiO2−x samples exhibit obviously improved photocatalytic activity. The 500 °C-Al-reduced TiO2−x sample degraded 52% of MO after 6 h, whereas pristine TiO2 degraded only 4% of MO. Phenol, which absorbs no visible light, was also applied as the decomposition substrate to avoid the interference from the absorption of dye. As shown in Fig. S15,† the 500 °C-Al-reduced TiO2−x sample degraded 78% of the phenol after 3.5 h, but pristine TiO2 had 82% residual of phenol.
The photocatalytic water splitting of the black TiO2−x samples was further performed to produce hydrogen gas, as shown in Fig. 6e. The amount of H2 generation increases with the Al-reduction temperature, similar to methyl orange degradation. The 500 °C-reduced sample steadily produced hydrogen gas at about 6.4 mmol h−1 g−1, which is 8.5 times higher than that of pristine TiO2 (0.75 mmol h−1 g−1) and comparable to the reported excellent photocatalysts.21,37 The visible-light photocatalysis of water splitting experiment is shown in Fig. 6f. The 500 °C-Al-reduced TiO2−x sample steadily produced hydrogen gas at about 140 μmol h−1 g−1, compared with no hydrogen detected for pristine TiO2. These results have verified that the core–shell structure of TiO2−x nanocrystals can enhance the photocatalytic activity.
Photoelectrochemical cell (PEC)
In order to further investigate the photoelectrochemical properties, pristine anatase TiO2 films were prepared on FTO glass substrates by magnetron sputtering a TiO2 target in an atmosphere of 5% O2 + 95% Ar. The as-sputtered films were first annealed at 500 °C for 2 h in air and further aluminum-reduced at 500 °C for 4 h (Fig. S16†). The TiO2−x layer was formed on the top of the TiO2 film. A set of linear-sweep photovoltammograms were recorded in the dark and under illumination from an AM 1.5 solar spectrum simulator, as shown in Fig. 7a. The potential was swept linearly at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 between 0.0 and 1.5 VRHE in a 1 M NaOH electrolyte (PH = 13.6). Both photoelectrodes showed insignificant dark current (<10−4 mA cm−2), indicating that no electrocatalytic oxygen evolution occurred. Under illumination, the TiO2−x electrode had a significant increase in photocurrent density, which is three times as high as that of TiO2 at 1.23 VRHE (corresponding to the potential of the reversible oxygen electrode). Furthermore, the onset potential of the photocurrent revealed a drastic shift from 0.45 VRHE for TiO2 to 0.18 VRHE for TiO2−x. The higher photocurrent density and the lower onset potential demonstrate more efficient charge separation and transportation in the black TiO2−x film, compared with the pristine TiO2 film.
 Fig. 7  Photoelectrochemical properties of pristine TiO2 and Al-reduced black TiO2−x electrodes: (a) chopped J–V curves under simulated solar light illumination using a three electrode setup (TiO2 working, Pt counter, Ag/AgCl reference electrode, scan rate of 10 mV s−1) in a 1 M NaOH electrolyte (pH = 13.6); (b) photoconversion efficiency as a function of applied potential; (c) Mott–Schottky plots collected at a frequency of 5 kHz in the dark; (d) IPCE spectra in the region of 300–700 nm at 0.65 VRHE. 
The solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies (η) of photoanodes were calculated using the equationη = I(1.23 − V)/Jlight,where V is the applied bias vs. RHE, I is the photocurrent density at the measured bias, and Jlight is the irradiance intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G). The calculated STH efficiency plotted as a function of the applied bias is shown in Fig. 7b. The pristine TiO2 sample exhibited an optimal conversion efficiency of ∼0.28% at 0.87 VRHE. Significantly, the TiO2−x sample achieved a very high efficiency at a lower bias of 0.65 VRHE (∼1.7%), which is among the best STH efficiencies (0.5–1.6%) for TiO2-based photoanodes.23,38 The PEC results imply that Al-reduction treatment substantially enhanced the photoconversion efficiency of TiO2 by improving the maximum photocurrent and reducing the driving potential.
The electrochemical impedance measurements were conducted on the pristine TiO2 and TiO2−x samples, and both samples showed a positive slope in the Mott–Schottky plots, as expected for n-type semiconductors (Fig. 7c). The TiO2−x sample showed a substantially smaller slope of the Mott–Schottky plot than the TiO2 sample, suggesting an increase of donor density. The carrier density was calculated from the slope of Mott–Schottky plots using the following equation,Nd = (2/e0εε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1,where e0 is the electron charge, ε is the dielectric constant of TiO2 (ε = 170), ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, Nd is the donor density, and V is the applied bias at the electrode. The calculated electron densities of TiO2 and TiO2−x were 7.67 × 1017 and 5.61 × 1019 cm−3, respectively.
In order to understand the interplay between the photoactivity and the light absorption of TiO2, incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed on pristine TiO2 and Al-reduced black TiO2−x photoanodes at 0.65 VRHE (Fig. 7d). The IPCE can be expressed by the following equationIPCE = (1240I)/(λJlight),where I is the measured photocurrent density at a specific wavelength, λ is the wavelength of incident light, and Jlight is the measured irradiance at a specific wavelength. In comparison with pristine TiO2, TiO2−x exhibits greatly enhanced photoactivity over the entire UV region and reached the IPCE values uniformly higher than 85% in the wavelength range from 300 to 370 nm. It indicates that the UV light was effectively used for PEC water splitting, in which the separation and transportation of photoexcited charge carriers are more efficient in TiO2−x. The recognizable photoactivity was also observed in the visible light region for the TiO2−x sample, whereas the IPCE value of TiO2−x is higher than that of pristine TiO2 in the visible light region from 400 nm to 470 nm. It indicates that Al-reduction not only highly enhances the efficiency of photoelectric conversion under UV light, but also extends the range of photo-response into the visible-light region.
Electronic structure
The electronic structures of the core–shell structured TiO2@TiO2−x are shown in Fig. 8. The band structure contributed from the crystalline core is similar to the anatase TiO2 phase, and the TiO2−x shell mainly provides some dispersed Ti3+ 3d below CBM and O 2p6 above VBM. Therefore, the schematic electronic structures of TiO2 and TiO2@TiO2−x (denoted as TiO2−x) are proposed in Fig. 8a, which are confirmed by the VASP DFT calculations in Fig. 8b (see the details in the ESI†). The amorphous shell of TiO2−x loses lattice periodicity and breaks the octahedral symmetry of TiO6, and two tails of the VBM and CBM are formed which can narrow the band gap of TiO2. Furthermore, the oxygen vacancies generated in the shell result in enormous Ti3+, and then the Fermi level of TiO2−x is shifted near CBM.
 Fig. 8  (a) Schematic electronic structures of TiO2 and TiO2−x. (b) Total DOS and partial DOS (Ti) of TiO2 and TiO2−x. 
There are two routes for light excitation in the TiO2−x samples: one arises from the Ti3+ 3d1 electrons near the Fermi level (close to CBM), and another from the O 2p6 electrons near VBM. The black coloration partially results from the transitions (Ti3+ 3d1 → Ti3+ 3d1 or Ti4+ 3d0) of the Ti3+ 3d1 electrons to the unoccupied Ti 3d states. The light absorption near VBM (O2− 2p6 → Ti3+ 3d1 or Ti4+ 3d0) is probably more effective for photocatalysis due to the longer life time of light-excited e–h pairs, which was observed by the photoluminescence (PL) measurement (Fig. S17†). From our DFT results and the literature data,16,39–42 the tail of CBM from Ti3+ 3d1 is about ∼0.7 eV below the CBM of TiO2 (EF), and the tail of the VBM from O 2p states is about ∼0.4 eV above the VBM of TiO2 (E1), which promise the better photoactivity than pristine TiO2.
Conclusions
Aluminum reduction is demonstrated to be an excellent approach suitable to produce oxygen-deficient TiO2−x in an evacuated two-zone furnace. The mechanism of aluminum reduction is attributed to sustaining low oxygen partial pressure from melting aluminum and releasing the O from TiO2. The as-prepared TiO2−x nanocrystals possess a unique core–shell structure of TiO2@TiO2−x, inducing significant enhancement of visible and near-infrared photoabsorption. The oxygen-deficient shells are well-controlled by reduction conditions and responsible for enhanced wide-spectrum light absorption, photocatalysis, and photoelectrochemical efficiency. Furthermore, the photothermic effect makes black titania be able to “capture” solar energy in solar thermal collectors. This aluminum reduction approach offers potential for the cost-effective and large scale production of black titania. Overall, our black titania with wide solar spectrum absorption possesses significant potential for more efficient hydrogen generation and water cleaning.
