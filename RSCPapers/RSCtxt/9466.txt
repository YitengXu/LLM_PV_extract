    , Accepted 4th September 2012First published on 4th September 2012AbstractThis paper describes heterogeneous 3-D nanotubular arrays of CdS-TiO2 fabricated by sensitizing anodized 3-D arrays of TiO2 nanotubes with CdS nanoparticles. The radial distribution of heterogeneous arrays on the circumference of Ti wire renders them capable of collecting visible light from any direction. In surroundings where reflection visible light is artificially made by a reflector, the photocurrent output of heterogeneous 3-D arrays is enhanced by ∼69% at 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a standard three-electrode cell. Based on quantitative measurements of photocurrent output of 3-D arrays under known irradiation intensity from two opposite directions simultaneously, the irradiation intensity of artificial reflection light in our system was determined to be ∼58 mW cm−2. By optimizing the length of TiO2 nanotubes and deposition of CdS nanoparticles, heterogeneous 3-D arrays collect direct incident light and artificial reflection light to generate a photocurrent output (normalized to the direct irradiation area) of ∼13.2 mA at 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) under 100 mW cm−2 simulated full light.
1. Introduction
Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have attracted significant attention for photoelectric conversion because of their ability to harvest photons in both the visible and infrared light spectrum by size control.1–10 Typically, a quantum dot chemically adsorbed mesoporous layer of TiO2 nanoparticles on a planar conductive glass is a key component of QDSCs. Under illumination, the photo-generated electrons transfer from quantum dots to the conduction band of a semiconductor with holes being scavenged by redox relays. When combined with sulfide/polysulfide redox couples, the conversion efficiency of planar QDSCs reached ∼4%.6,11
Anodized self-ordered TiO2 nanotubular arrays provides intuitive one-dimensional electric channels, which overcome the boundary effect in the conventional mesoporous layer of nanoparticles and increases charge collection efficiency.12–15 By using TiO2 nanotubular arrays instead of TiO2 nanoparticles, high photoelectric performance has been demonstrated in planar (2-D) QDSCs.16–20 Further optimizing the light management to collect all the photons that reach the TiO2-nanotube-based QDSCs has great potential to enhance the output of solar electricity,21 so is able to reduce the cost of solar electricity.
In nature, specular or diffuse reflection light is easily artificially available by some reflective surfaces. Collection of this artificial reflection visible light requires fine design of the geometry of QDSCs, since TiO2-nanotube-based planar (2-D) QDSCs can only convert the sunlight directly incident on the front side into electricity because of the opacity of the Ti substrate (Scheme 1a). A 3-D design for TiO2-nanotube-based QDSCs is capable of collecting surrounding visible light from any direction, including directly incident light and artificial reflection light, which therefore offers an opportunity to increase the total output of electrical power (Scheme 1b). A similar idea of fibrous design for organic and dye-sensitized solar cells has been demonstrated by one of the authors in this paper22 and other groups.23–29 However, 3-D design on QDSCs to efficiently collect reflection light from the surrounding areas for enhanced photoelectric output has not yet been explored.

Because of the opacity of Ti substrate, 2-D QDSCs can only convert the sunlight directly incident on the front side into electricity. The artificial reflection light cannot be converted into electricity. However, in the 3-D geometry, the radial distribution of heterogeneous arrays on the circumference of Ti wire renders them capable of collecting light from any direction, including directly incident light and artificial reflection light. 
Herein, we developed CdS nanoparticles sensitized 3-D arrays of TiO2 nanotubular arrays by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method. Our present results indicated that the photoelectric output of heterogeneous 3-D arrays demonstrated no angular dependence on the incident light. More interestingly, heterogeneous 3-D arrays were capable of efficiently collecting the reflection light artificially made by a reflector in the surroundings, which enhanced the total output of photocurrent efficiently. This new 3-D geometry has a distinct potentiality to reduce the cost of solar electricity generated by QDSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1 Fabrication of 3-D nanotubular arrays
3-D arrays of TiO2 nanotubular arrays were prepared by electrochemical anodization of Ti wires (Φ = 0.25 mm, 99.7%, Aldrich) following our previous method.12,30 Briefly, Ti wires were anodized at 60 V (HB17601SL2A, Shanghai Meitian Wiring Co., Ltd) in an electrolyte consisting of 0.25 wt% ammonium fluoride (Beijing Chemical Factory, China) and 2 vol% Milli-Q water in ethylene glycol (Xilong Chemical Factory, China) for 4–24 h. Subsequently, the anatase crystallization of TiO2 nanotubes was achieved by annealing the as-anodized samples at 500 °C under ambient air for 3 h.
2.2 Deposition of CdS nanoparticles
Deposition of CdS nanoparticles on 3-D arrays of TiO2 nanotubes was achieved by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method.17 Typically, 3-D nanotubular arrays were immersed in a 0.05 M Cd(NO3)2 (Beijing Chemical Factory, China) solution for 30 s. After rinsing thoroughly with Milli-Q water, they were immersed in a 0.05 M Na2S (Beijing Chemical Factory, China) for another 30 s followed by another thorough rinsing. The SILAR process was repeated until the desired deposition of CdS nanoparticles was achieved.
2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectric performances of heterogeneous 3-D nanotubular arrays were characterized in a standard three-electrode cell with a quartz window using a CHI660D potentiostat (Shanghai Chenhua Apparatus Co., China). A Pt wire acted as a counter electrode and the reference electrode was a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode. The electrolyte was 0.1 M Na2S solution (Beijing Chemical Factory, China). The light source was a Xe lamp (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co. Ltd, China) with an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, which was calibrated by a standard Si solar cell (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co. Ltd, China). Optical band-pass filters (Shenyang HB Optical Technology Co., Ltd, China) were used to measure wavelength-dependent photocurrent output. The incident light area was 2 × 2 cm2. The geometric length of heterogeneous 3-D nanotubular arrays irradiated directly by the incident light was 2 cm, which was fixed by a photo-mask. The direct irradiation area of 3-D arrays was determined to be the projected area (0.058 cm2) of the anodized Ti wire with a diameter of 0.029 cm (as shown in Fig. 1a). The photocurrent output of heterogeneous 3-D arrays was normalized to the direct irradiation area. It was noted that the rear side of Ti wire collected the artificial reflection light as shown in Scheme 1b. An aluminum foil covered on the perimeter of the electrochemical cell acted as a reflector to generate artificial reflection light. The diagram for photoelectrochemical measurements is shown in Scheme 1b. Note that the reference and counter electrodes are not on the light path. Therefore, they do not affect the photocurrent output of 3-D arrays. In order to clarify quantitatively the effect of artificial reflection light on the photocurrent output of heterogeneous 3-D arrays, we used another Xe lamp to produce mimetic reflection light with known light intensity. The photocurrent output of 3-D arrays under known irradiation intensity from two opposite directions simultaneously was measured in a electrochemical cell with two quartz windows. Note that in this case no reflector was used.

2.4 Characterization
Morphologies of heterogeneous 3-D arrays were studied using a FEI Quanta FEG 250 environmental scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a JEOL JEM-2011 transmission electron microscope (TEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray diffraction meter in the range of 20–60°. The diffuse UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a GBC Cintra10e spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Since the diameter of Ti wire was very thin, the characterization of CdS nanoparticles deposition was performed on the conventional planar arrays fabricated under identical conditions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of CdS nanoparticles
Typical cross-sectional and top view SEM images of 3-D arrays of TiO2 nanotubes are shown in Fig. 1a and b. The diameter of Ti wire after anodization increased from 0.25 mm to 0.29 mm because of the higher molar volume of TiO2 compared with that of Ti metal. Fig. 1a depicted that well-defined TiO2 nanotubes were grown in a radially outward direction on the circumference of Ti wire, featuring a 3-D distribution. The average internal diameter of nanotubes was determined to be ∼84 nm and the wall thickness was ∼21 nm (Fig. 1b). The length of 3-D nanotubular arrays could be controlled finely by anodization time. After 15 cycles of CdS SILAR deposition, the visual color of 3-D arrays changed from pale to yellow, indicating the formation of CdS nanoparticles (Fig. 1c). TEM measurements (Fig. 1d and e and Fig. S1, ESI†) demonstrated that CdS nanoparticles with a size of ∼5 nm filled the inside of TiO2 nanotubes, which indicated that Cd2+ and S2+ ions can diffuse into the nanotubes and form nanocrystalline structures.
The formation of CdS nanoparticles was further evidenced by the measurements of XRD and UV-visible absorption spectra (Fig. 2). TiO2 nanotubes were typically composed of anatase phases, as evidenced by the strong diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.5°, 37.3°, 38.1°, 48.2°, 54.2°, and 55.2° (Fig. 2A). After CdS deposition for 15 cycles, three new diffraction peaks at 2θ = 26.5°, 44.0° and 51.9° appeared, which could be indexed to the (111), (220) and (311) crystal faces of cubic β-CdS phase. UV-visible absorption spectra (Fig. 2B) indicated that the absorption threshold (λg) of TiO2 nanotubes is at ∼391 nm, with a band gap (Eg) of 3.17 eV. After CdS deposition of 5 cycles, λg shifted to a longer wavelength 510 nm (Eg ≈ 2.43 eV), which is favorable for the utilization of visible light. By increasing cycles of CdS deposition to 10 and 20, we shifted the λg to 539 nm (Eg ≈ 2.3 eV) and 600 nm (Eg ≈ 2.07 eV) respectively. These red-shifts λg could be ascribed to the aggregation of CdS nanoparticles in nanotubular arrays.17

3.2 Collection of reflection light for enhanced photoelectric output
CdS nanoparticles have been demonstrated to be an effective sensitizer for planar (2-D) arrays of TiO2 nanotubes, which can extend the response of the electrode in the visible region.16–20 Because of the opacity of Ti substrate, conventional TiO2-nanotube-based planar QDSCs can only convert the sunlight directly incident on the front side into electricity. A significant characteristic of heterogeneous 3-D nanotubular arrays is their ability to collect visible light in the surrounding areas from any direction, including the directly incident light and artificial reflection light. In order to simulate some surroundings where a high reflection light is available, an aluminum foil covered on the perimeter of the electrochemical cell is used as a reflector to generate reflection light artificially. Fig. 3A shows the photocurrent output-potential curves of heterogeneous 3-D nanotubular arrays with a nanotubular length of ∼42 μm under standard 100 mW cm−2 simulated full light. The cycle of CdS nanoparticles deposition is 15. Because of the well-matched level of energy bands of TiO2 and CdS,31 photo-excited electrons in CdS nanoparticles are injected into the conduction band of TiO2, and holes are scavenged by S2−/Sn2− redox couple. The Sn2− ions are generated over time following the oxidation of S2− ions by the photo-induced holes in CdS nanoparticles. The transfer of photo-generated electrons to the outer circuit contributes to the generation of photocurrent. When no reflector was applied (NR model), 3-D heterogeneous arrays generated a photocurrent output of 3.9 mA (normalized to the direct irradiation area) under 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) and an open circuit potential (OCP) of −1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). When an aluminum foil was applied on the perimeter of the electrochemical cell acting as a reflector (WR model), 3-D heterogeneous arrays generated a photocurrent output of 6.6 mA under 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl), which was enhanced by ∼69%. Wavelength-dependent photocurrent output (Fig. 3B) at 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) demonstrated that the photocurrent output was enhanced by the artificial reflection light in the whole absorption range of CdS nanoparticles (440–590 nm). It was noted that under the WR model, the front side of Ti wire collected the directly incident light and the rear side collected the artificial reflection light. Actually, our 3-D geometry did not change the intrinsic photoelectric properties of CdS sensitized TiO2 nanotubes. The enhancement of the photocurrent output of heterogeneous 3-D arrays was from efficient collection of artificial reflection light by the 3-D geometry. Correspondingly, this artificial reflection light could not be collected by conventional 2-D QDSCs efficiently. As shown in Fig. S2, ESI,† only 11% enhancement in photocurrent output under 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) was obtained for reference heterogeneous 2-D arrays by artificial reflection light. Except for the reflection effect of the reflector, the incident light might be condensed by the reflector because of its circular geometry. The possible effect of light concentration will be investigated in our future work.

(B) Wavelength-dependent photocurrent output at 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of heterogeneous 3-D arrays under (a) NR model and (b) WR model. The length of TiO2 nanotubes is ∼42 μm. The cycle of CdS nanoparticles deposition is 15. The light source is 100 mW cm−2 simulated full light. The photocurrent output was normalized to the direct irradiation area. 
In order to clarify quantitatively the effect of artificial reflection light on the photocurrent output of 3-D arrays, we used another Xe lamp to produce mimetic reflection light with known light intensity. Note that in this case no reflector was used. As shown in Fig. 4A, when 3-D arrays were irradiated simultaneously by directly incident light and mimetic reflection light with same intensity of 100 mW cm−2 from two opposite directions, a photocurrent output of ∼8.0 mA was obtained at 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl), which was the sum of that under irradiation of one direction (3.9 mA + 4.0 mA, Fig. 4B and Fig. S3, ESI†). When the intensity of mimetic reflection was tuned to be 50 mW cm−2 and 150 mW cm−2 while keeping the intensity of directly incident light to be 100 mW cm−2, the photocurrent output at 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of 3-D arrays irradiated simultaneously from two directions were ∼6.3 mA and ∼9.5 mA respectively, which is a similar combined value to the photocurrent output under irradiation in one direction (2.3 mA + 4.0 mA, 5.6 mA + 4.0 mA, Fig. 4B and Fig. S4, ESI†). The photocurrent output of 3-D arrays showed a linear increase with the total irradiation intensity (including the directly incident light and mimetic reflection light) between 150 and 250 mW cm−2 (Fig. S5, ESI†). Based on the linear fitting of Fig. S5,† we calculated that the irradiation intensity of artificial reflection light in our system was ∼58 mW cm−2. Our results indicate clearly that 3-D heterogeneous arrays are capable of collecting reflection light in the surrounding areas to enhance photocurrent output. Therefore, the photoelectric output of 3-D heterogeneous arrays is always characterized with a reflector (WR model).

The intensity of the mimetic reflection light is (a) 50 mW cm−2 (R50), (b) 100 mW cm−2 (R100) and (c) 150 mW cm−2 (R150). The intensity of the directly incident light is fixed to be 100 mW cm−2 (I100). Inset: the irradiation directions of the directly incident light and mimetic reflection light. (B) The corresponding values of photocurrent output at 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl). The values under irradiation by only directly incident light (I100) and by only mimetic reflection light with different intensity (R50, R100 and R150) are also shown. Note that in this case no reflector was used. The length of TiO2 nanotubes is ∼42 μm. The cycle of CdS nanoparticles deposition is 15. 
3.3 Optimization of photoelectric output
The photoelectric output of heterogeneous 3-D nanotubular arrays could be further optimized by altering the length of TiO2 nanotubes. As shown in Fig. 5A, when fixing the cycle of CdS deposition to be 15, by increasing the length of nanotubes from ∼42 μm to ∼85 μm, we improved the photocurrent output at 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) from ∼6.7 mA to ∼10.2 mA. This significant improvement of photocurrent output was ascribed to the increased amount of CdS nanoparticles in the nanotubular arrays, which resulted in high light collection efficiency. However, if the length of nanotubes was further increased to ∼100 μm, the photocurrent output of 3-D heterogeneous arrays decreased to ∼9.4 mA. This decreased photocurrent should be related to the limited the electron diffusion length in the nanotubular arrays.32
 Fig. 5  (A) Photocurrent output-potential curves of heterogeneous 3-D arrays under WR model. The lengths of TiO2 nanotubes are (a) 42 μm, (b) 85 μm and (c) 100 μm. The cycle of CdS nanoparticles deposition is fixed to be 15. (B) Photocurrent output-potential curves of heterogeneous 3-D arrays under WR model. The cycles of CdS nanoparticles deposition are (a) 15, (b) 20 and (c) 25. The length of TiO2 nanotubes is fixed to be 85 μm. Inset: the dependence of photocurrent output at 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) on the depositing cycles of CdS nanoparticles. The light source is 100 mW cm−2 simulated full light. The photocurrent output was normalized to the direct irradiation area. 
For heterogeneous 3-D nanotubular arrays with a nanotubular length of ∼85 μm, we could optimize the photoelectric output by changing the cycles of CdS SILAR deposition. As shown in Fig. 5B, by increasing the cycles of CdS deposition, we improved the photocurrent output of heterogeneous 3-D arrays. When the cycle of CdS deposition was 25, a maximal photocurrent output of ∼13.2 mA (normalized to the direct irradiation area) was obtained. The corresponding photoelectrode efficiency (not cell efficiency) is calculated to be 7.4% (Fig. S6, ESI†). Note that the photocurrent output of ∼13.2 mA was higher than the maximum theoretical value of photocurrent density (Jsc) calculated by integrating the lamp spectrum over an IPCE of unity for the corresponding absorption wavelength. The reason is that the efficient collections of artificial reflection light by the heterogeneous 3-D arrays.
The increase in the cycle of CdS deposition to be 30 could further increase the amount of CdS nanoparticles. However, this increment in CdS adsorption was unable to continue to improve the photocurrent output (Fig. 5B, inset). We consider that two reasonable reasons can be ascribed to this decreased photocurrent output. Firstly, the increased amount of CdS nanoparticles may block the pores of TiO2 nanotubes, which slows the diffusion rate of S2−/Sn2− redox couple in the nanotubular arrays. Secondly, the increased amount of CdS nanoparticles reduces the optical penetration depth of the arrays. The outer CdS nanoparticles locating far from the Ti substrate act as a filter for the incident light. Therefore, the inner CdS nanoparticles locating close to the Ti substrate cannot generate electrons efficiently, which increases the series resistance of the nanotubular arrays, resulting in decreased photocurrent output.
Although our present 3-D geometry does not change the intrinsic photoelectric properties of CdS nanoparticles sensitized TiO2 nanotubular arrays, by collecting the directly incident light and artificial reflection light simultaneously, heterogeneous 3-D nanotubular arrays generate a photocurrent output (normalized to the direct irradiation area) of ∼13.2 mA at 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) under standard 100 mW cm−2 simulated full light. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest photocurrent output in the CdS-TiO2 nanotubular system when measured in a three-electrode cell.16–20 Our results indicate that this new 3-D geometry is exciting for the applications of QDSCs in particular surroundings where a high reflection light is available.
3.4 Ability of 3-D light collection
Generally, the photoelectric output of conventional 2-D arrays of TiO2 nanotubes shows a large angular dependence on the incident light.30 However, in our new 3-D geometry, heterogeneous nanotubular arrays are grown radially on the circumference of Ti wires, which are oriented in all directions and are capable of collecting the light from any direction. Therefore, we investigated the photocurrent output of heterogeneous 3-D nanotubular arrays under a WR model when the electrode was rotated in z-axis from 0° to 360° in clockwise directions. The photocurrent output-potential curves at 0°, 90°, 180°, 270° and 360° were almost same (Fig. S7, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 6, the photocurrent output of heterogeneous 3-D arrays showed almost no dependence on rotation angles. Under any rotation angle, heterogeneous nanotubular 3-D arrays generated almost the same photocurrent output. However, the photocurrent output of the reference heterogeneous 2-D arrays demonstrated a large angular dependence. When the 2-D arrays were rotated by 180° in a clockwise direction, the photocurrent output was only 18% of that at 0°. The rotation of the electrode in z-axis could be regarded to simulate the change in the incident angle of the daylight.24 Therefore, our results indicated that heterogeneous 3-D nanotubular arrays were capable of following solar position to achieve maximal photoelectric output at any time during a sunny day.

The light source is 100 mW cm−2 simulated full light. The length of TiO2 nanotubes is ∼85 μm. The cycle of CdS nanoparticles deposition is 25. 
4. Conclusions
In summary, we developed heterogeneous 3-D nanotubular arrays by depositing CdS nanoparticles on 3-D arrays of TiO2 nanotubes. This new 3-D geometry was capable of collecting visible light from any direction. In surroundings where reflection light was artificially made by a reflector, the photocurrent output of heterogeneous 3-D arrays was enhanced by ∼69% at 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a standard three-electrode cell. The irradiation intensity of artificial reflection light in our system was determined to be ∼58 mW cm−2 based on the quantitative measurements of photocurrent output of 3-D arrays under known irradiation intensity from two opposite directions simultaneously. By optimizing the length of TiO2 nanotubes and the deposition of CdS nanoparticles, heterogeneous 3-D arrays collected the directly incident light and the artificial reflection light efficiently to generate a photocurrent output (normalized to the direct irradiation area) of ∼13.2 mA at 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) under standard 100 mW cm−2 simulated full light. Our 3-D concept for QDSCs provided a new avenue to utilize the sunlight more efficiently, which can reduce the cost of solar electricity.

Table Content:

 	Scheme 1  Collection of artificial reflection light by (a) planar (2-D) and (b) 3-D QDSCs based on TiO2 nanotubular arrays. Because of the opacity of Ti substrate, 2-D QDSCs can only convert the sunlight directly incident on the front side into electricity. The artificial reflection light cannot be converted into electricity. However, in the 3-D geometry, the radial distribution of heterogeneous arrays on the circumference of Ti wire renders them capable of collecting light from any direction, including directly incident light and artificial reflection light.	 

 	Fig. 1  (a) Overall and (b) top-view SEM images of 3-D arrays of TiO2 nanotubes. (c) Photographs of 3-D arrays of TiO2 nanotubes before and after CdS nanoparticles deposition. (d and e) TEM images of (d) TiO2 nanotubes and (e) CdS-TiO2 nanotubes.	 

 	Fig. 2  (A) X-ray diffraction patterns of (a) TiO2 nanotubes and (b) CdS-TiO2 nanotubes with CdS deposition of 20 cycles. (B) UV-visible absorption spectra of (a) TiO2 nanotubes and (b–d) CdS-TiO2 nanotubes with CdS deposition of (b) 5, (c) 10, (d) 20 cycles. The length of TiO2 nanotubes is ∼42 μm.	 

 	Fig. 3  (A) Photocurrent output-potential curves of heterogeneous 3-D nanotubular arrays under (a) NR model (no reflector) and (b) WR model (with reflector). (B) Wavelength-dependent photocurrent output at 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of heterogeneous 3-D arrays under (a) NR model and (b) WR model. The length of TiO2 nanotubes is ∼42 μm. The cycle of CdS nanoparticles deposition is 15. The light source is 100 mW cm−2 simulated full light. The photocurrent output was normalized to the direct irradiation area.	 

 	Fig. 4  (A) Photocurrent output-potential curves of heterogeneous 3-D arrays irradiated simultaneously by directly incident light (I) and mimetic reflection light (R) from two opposite directions. The intensity of the mimetic reflection light is (a) 50 mW cm−2 (R50), (b) 100 mW cm−2 (R100) and (c) 150 mW cm−2 (R150). The intensity of the directly incident light is fixed to be 100 mW cm−2 (I100). Inset: the irradiation directions of the directly incident light and mimetic reflection light. (B) The corresponding values of photocurrent output at 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl). The values under irradiation by only directly incident light (I100) and by only mimetic reflection light with different intensity (R50, R100 and R150) are also shown. Note that in this case no reflector was used. The length of TiO2 nanotubes is ∼42 μm. The cycle of CdS nanoparticles deposition is 15.	 

 	Fig. 5  (A) Photocurrent output-potential curves of heterogeneous 3-D arrays under WR model. The lengths of TiO2 nanotubes are (a) 42 μm, (b) 85 μm and (c) 100 μm. The cycle of CdS nanoparticles deposition is fixed to be 15. (B) Photocurrent output-potential curves of heterogeneous 3-D arrays under WR model. The cycles of CdS nanoparticles deposition are (a) 15, (b) 20 and (c) 25. The length of TiO2 nanotubes is fixed to be 85 μm. Inset: the dependence of photocurrent output at 0 V potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) on the depositing cycles of CdS nanoparticles. The light source is 100 mW cm−2 simulated full light. The photocurrent output was normalized to the direct irradiation area.	 

 	Fig. 6  The angular dependence of photocurrent output at 0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) of heterogeneous (a) 3-D and (b) reference 2-D arrays on the incident light under WR model. The light source is 100 mW cm−2 simulated full light. The length of TiO2 nanotubes is ∼85 μm. The cycle of CdS nanoparticles deposition is 25.
