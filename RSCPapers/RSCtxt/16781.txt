    , Accepted 28th March 2023First published on 31st March 2023AbstractA wide-bandgap two-dimensional polymer PBDT-BDT based on alternating benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) units with triphenylamine (TPA) conjugated side chains is designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the prolonged conjugation of the side groups, PBDT-BDT exhibits excellent light-harvesting properties ranging from 300 to 600 nm, especially including strong ultraviolet absorption due to the featured absorption of TPA groups, which is complementary to the absorption region of the well-known non-fullerene acceptor Y6. Additionally, PBDT-BDT shows a deep highest occupied molecular orbital energy level (−5.45 eV). When blended with the PC61BM acceptor, the PBDT-BDT-based device achieves a PCE of 6.33% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.91 V, while the PBDT-BDT:Y6 device achieves a PCE of 12.26% with a short circuit current of 21.58 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 71% due to the efficient charge transport and a favorable active layer morphology. This work suggests that maintaining the donor–donor polymer backbone with the BDT unit forming suitable conjugated side chains is an effective two-dimensional strategy for obtaining highly efficient wide band-gap polymers for fullerene-based and fullerene-free OSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) as a renewable energy technology have attracted widespread attention due to their low cost, solution processing, light weight, and good flexibility.1–5 The photovoltaic layer composed of conjugated polymer donors and fullerene or non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) in OSCs has made significant progress in realizing efficient bulk heterojunction OSC devices.6–9 To date, the champion power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of single-junction OSCs based on NFAs have been beyond 19% because of the development of molecular engineering of NFAs due to their distinct features such as strong absorption range, absorption strength and good miscibility with donor polymers.10–15 At present, donor polymers, especially the wide band-gap polymers, have attracted less attention than previously reported NFAs. Thus, it is imperative to develop novel wide band-gap polymer donors with complementary absorption matching that of these highly efficient visible and NIR-responsive NFAs for further improving the device performance in OSCs.
To the best of our knowledge, highly efficient narrow band-gap NFAs usually show strong photon harvesting in the broad visible and NIR range.16–19 Correspondingly, the wide band gap polymer donor should have complementary absorption in the short wavelength region. Thus, the complementary absorption allows the active layer to generate more excitons, which is an important basis for achieving high short circuit current (Jsc) and PCE of a device.20,21 Additionally, the low HOMO energy level of the wide band gap polymer donor can be properly matched with that of NFAs to minimize the energy level shift between the donor and the acceptor, thereby reducing energy loss and generating high open circuit voltage (Voc) of a device. For example, Hou et al. developed a novel polythiophene-based (PT) donor achieving a breakthrough PCE of 10.16% with an excellent Voc of 0.94 V when blended with the ITIC acceptor. In addition, a feasible strategy is the incorporation of electron-withdrawing groups into the conjugated backbones of PTs.22 Duan et al. reported a new donor P5TCN-F with cyano-group substitutions to achieve a prominent PCE of 16.6% with enhanced Voc approaching 0.8 V in Y6-based OSCs.23 So far, most of the efficient donor polymers adopt donor–acceptor (D–A) molecular architectures with alternating electron-rich and weakly electron-deficient building blocks in the backbone. Among the numerous polymer donors, the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) moiety has emerged as one of the most promising electron-donating building blocks due to its inherent structural symmetry and rigid fused aromatic system benefitting the enhancement of electron delocalization and charge mobility.24–27 When the most promising electron-deficient building blocks such as dithieno[3,2:3,4;2,3:5,6]-benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBT), [7c]benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]-dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD), thieno-[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), and pyrrolo[3,4-f]benzotriazole5,7-dione (TzBI) are combined with BDT, it enables PCEs of over 15% for the corresponding polymers (PM6, D18, J101 and PTB7).28–37 However, we are intrigued to know whether constructing two-dimensional (2-D) conjugated polymers is an effective way of developing high-performance donor materials besides this linear D–A design concept. We first reported two-dimensional polyfluorenes bearing thienylenevinylene π-bridge–acceptor side chains for photovoltaic solar cells and the 2-D structures facilitated the isotropic charge transport of polymers compared to the linear fluorine-based polymer.38 Thus, there is still room for improvement and further exploration of new BDT-based polymer donors with suitable HOMO energy levels via the two-dimensional strategy that grafts π-conjugated side chains onto an electron-rich backbone should be considered.
A general methodology in our previous work was proposed for straightforward access to 4,8-functionalized BDT via Pd-mediated coupling reactions to resolve the steric hindrance of fused aromatic substituents. For example, a larger planar structure of the thio[3,2-b]-thiophene (TT) unit vertical to the core of BDT was successfully synthesized and a BTT-FIC acceptor based on the above-mentioned central core with a TT side-chain was developed and a champion PCE of 12.65% was achieved for benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]di(cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene)-containing NFAs at that moment.39 As we know, triphenylamine (TPA) groups enabling efficient hole extraction and transport are often used in perovskite solar cells. The combination of TPA groups and BDT as conjugated side chains will achieve the longitudinal conjugated extension of the BDT unit and they are more inclined to form ordered molecular packing, which is helpful for charge migration in OSCs. Meanwhile, TPA groups show exceptionally good light-harvesting range in the ultraviolet absorption region, which is complementary to the absorption region of the conjugated materials in the visible and near-infrared regions. Herein, a new electron-rich central BDT core attached to bulky side chains of conjugated TPA groups was successfully designed and synthesized via the aforementioned method. Subsequently, the wide band-gap polymer by grafting TPA-conjugated side chains onto the electron-rich polybenzodithiophene backbone was successfully developed. The photophysical and electrochemical properties, film morphology, and photovoltaic performances of this polymer were systematically investigated. The resulting polymer exhibited strong ultraviolet and visible absorption ranging from 300 to 600 nm and deep-lying HOMO levels of −5.45 eV due to the advantageous design in which the D–D polymer backbone is maintained compared to the D–A skeleton architecture. With the PC61BM acceptor, the PBDT-BDT-based device achieves a PCE of 6.33% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.88 V, while the PBDT-BDT:Y6 device shows a PCE of 12.26% with a short circuit current of 21.58 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 71% due to the efficient charge transport and a favorable active layer morphology. This result reveals that maintaining the donor–donor polymer backbone with the BDT unit forming suitable conjugated side chains is an effective strategy for obtaining highly efficient wide band-gap polymers for fullerene-based and fullerene-free OSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The composite route to the key brominated BDT-TBA-Br monomer and the final polymer is listed in Scheme 1, and the synthetic steps are depicted in the ESI.† The reduction of the starting material BDT-CO with sodium borohydride in ethanol afforded the important intermediate BDT-OH in 99% isolated yield under heating at 85 °C. Ensuing treatment of BDT-OH with Tf2O and pyridine in CH2Cl2 provided the key intermediate, 4,8-functionalized BDT-OTf, in 85% yield. Suzuki coupling of BDT-OTf with triphenylamine boronic ester first afforded BDT-TBA with the bulky side chains in 50% yield. The vital intermediate BDT-TBA-Br was then prepared in 80% isolated yield via the lithiation of n-butyllithium and subsequent nucleophilic bromination of CBr4. The targeted polymer donor PBDT-BDT was achieved with Stille coupling polymerization between BDT-Tin and BDT-TBA-Br in 91% yield by microwave synthesis. The polymer donor was easily soluble in common solvents including chloroform, toluene, and chlorobenzene at room temperature.

2.2. Photophysical properties and energy levels
The normalized ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption in the spectrum of the polymer in the chloroform solution and film is shown in Fig. 1a. It is found that the spectral absorption range of the obtained polymer donor in solution is between 300 nm and 600 nm, and the two sets of maximum absorption peaks are located at 348 nm and 500 nm in solution. The red-shifted maximum absorption peaks of the PBDT-BDT film compared with those of the solution transform into 360 and 550 nm due to the strengthened π–π molecular stacking. The absorption spectrum covering the range of 300 nm–400 nm in solution and films is mainly attributed to the characteristic absorption of the triphenylamine group of the polymer side chain substituent, and the absorption spectrum in the range of 450 nm–600 nm is mainly caused by the intramolecular charge transfer effect in the polymer backbone. The polymer Eoptg = 2.06 eV was calculated according to the formula Eoptg = 1240/λonset. Thus, benefiting from the prolonged conjugation of the side groups, PBDT-BDT exhibits excellent light-harvesting properties ranging from 300 to 600 nm, which is complementary to the absorption region of the well-known non-fullerene acceptor Y6. The electrochemical performance parameters related to PBDT-BDT were tested by cyclic voltammetry and the oxidation CV curve of the PBDT-BDT polymer was obtained and is shown in Fig. 1b. It is found that PBDT-BDT achieves a good, closed loop curve during the scanning process, and obvious redox peak positions appear. According to the position of the redox peak of the zone, the Eoxon and Eredon were 1.0 eV and −0.8 eV, and the corresponding HOMO/LUMO energy levels were −5.45 eV and −3.2 eV, respectively. The obtained HOMO level agrees well with the results of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene derivatives with deep low-lying HOMO levels listed in our previous work. The incorporated electron-rich TPA substituent has a negligible effect on the HOMO energy level and the whole D–D electron-rich molecular backbone is determined by alternating BDT units. The energy offset of PBDT-BDT/Y6 would be small and high Voc of the device is expected to be obtained.40

2.3. Photovoltaic performance
In order to study the photovoltaic performance of the PBDT-BDT polymer donor in detail, a blended photoactive layer was prepared with PC61BM or Y6 as the acceptor and the PBDT-BDT polymer as the donor with a device geometry of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/PDINN/Ag. The D:A blend weight ratios, the 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive and the annealing treatment temperature were systematically optimized to achieve the optimal device fabrication conditions of OSCs. The detailed device data for the different optimization processes can be found in Fig. S1.† The optimized experimental conditions are a D/A weight ratio of 1:1.5 and 1 vol% DIO additive for PBDT-BDT:PC61BM blend films, and the active layers of PBDT-BDT:Y6 blend films were annealed at a temperature of 100 °C for 10 min. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the champion OSCs based on PBDT-BDT:PC61BM and PBDT-BDT:Y6 under solar illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. In OSCs with PC61BM as the acceptor, different weight ratios of PBDT-BDT:PC61BM (1:1, 1:1.5 and 1:2) were studied. It was found that the optimal D:A ratio was 1:1.5 for PBDT-BDT:PC61BM and the corresponding device gave a PCE of 5.84% with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 10.94 mA cm−2 and a FF of 60%. After using 1% vol DIO additive, an optimized PCE of 6.33% was further obtained for the PBDT-BDT:PC61BM device, and the corresponding Voc was 0.88 V, Jsc was 11.61 mA cm−2 and FF was 62%. The PBDT-BDT:PC61BM-based PSCs treated via thermal annealing gave a PCE of 5.77% with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 11.50 mA cm−2 and a FF of 57%, which is close to that of the as-cast devices (5.50%). This result shows that the annealing process has a negative influence on device performance. The poor device performances are mainly attributed to the low Jsc value of the devices, and this could originate from the narrow absorption ranges of the active layers composed of the polymer:PC61BM blend films.41

To further improve the device performance, the classic non-fullerene material Y6 was used as the acceptor instead of PC61BM to investigate its impact on the photovoltaic performance of the PBDT-BDT polymer donor. The donor and acceptor with a mass ratio of 1:1 were configured to prepare a photovoltaic device for testing. For the PBDT-BDT:Y6 device, a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 10.59% was obtained, and the corresponding Voc was 0.79 V, Jsc was 20.62 mA cm−2 and FF was 65%. Compared with the PC61BM device, the performance parameters of the device were greatly improved, which was attributed to the good match of the absorption spectra of PBDT-BDT and Y6.42 We further studied the effect of the annealing temperature of the active layer on the performance of the PBDT-BDT:Y6 device. At an annealing temperature of 100 °C, a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 12.26% was obtained for the PBDT-BDT:Y6 device, and the corresponding Voc was 0.80 V, Jsc was 21.58 mA cm−2 and FF was 71%. The annealing process greatly improved the morphology of the active layer, resulting in an effective increase in the fill factor.

Fig. 3 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the blend films PBDT-BDT:PC61BM and PBDT-BDT:Y6. For PBDT-BDT:PC61BM, the external quantum efficiency absorption spectrum appears in the strong spectral response range of 300– 600 nm, which is consistent with the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of the PBDT-BDT:PC61BM blend films. For PBDT-BDT:Y6 blend films, the external quantum efficiency absorption spectrum has a broad and strong spectral response in the range of 400–900 nm. The spectral response range from 400 nm to 600 nm was mainly related to the PBDT-BDT donor, while the spectral response range from 620 nm to 900 nm was mainly related to the non-fullerene acceptor Y6. The PBDT-BDT:Y6-based OSCs after annealing treatment present stronger photocurrent responses (over 60% of the EQE value across the range of 450–850 nm) than that of the as-cast cells, resulting in an obvious enhancement of Jsc, which are in accordance with those obtained from the J–V characteristics.

To further investigate the charge transport behaviors of the two PC61BM and Y6 acceptors in the optimized devices, the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of these blend films were characterized by adopting the space charge limited current (SCLC) method43,44 (Fig. 4a and b) and the corresponding mobility data are summarized in Table 2. The PBDT-BDT:PC61BM blend films with thermal annealing showed a μh mobility of 5.22 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe mobility of 2.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Correspondingly, the annealing-treated PBDT-BDT:Y6 blend film exhibited a much higher μh of 2.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 2.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Apparently, it is found that the Y6-based blend film exhibits a more balanced transport behavior with the outstanding μe/μh ratio being 1.31, which is lower than that of the PC61BM-based blend film with μe/μh of 4.06. The higher and more balanced μe/μh carrier mobilities of the thermally annealed PBDT-BDT:Y6 blend film may partly account for the enhanced Jsc and FF of the Y6-based OSCs.45

To obtain deeper insights into the distinct difference in the photovoltaic performance, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to investigate the morphology of PBDT-BDT:PC61BM blend films with or without the additive and PBDT-BDT:Y6 blend films with or without annealing. The AFM height and phase images are shown in Fig. 5a–d and e–f. The as-cast PBDT-BDT:PC61BM and PBDT-BDT:PC61BM blend films with the additive exhibited a uniform and smooth surface with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 1.60 nm and 1.51 nm, respectively, which indicates better compatibility between the polymeric donor and fullerene acceptor components in the blend films via the additive treatment. In addition, the RMS roughness of PBDT-BDT:Y6 blend films after thermal annealing is rougher than that of the as-cast blend films. Moreover, the annealing-treated PBDT-BDT:Y6 blend films exhibit more obvious phase separation than PBDT-BDT:Y6 blend films without annealing, which helps to improve the efficiency of exciton dissociation.46 Besides, it was observed that PBDT-BDT:PC61BM blend films with the additive and PBDT-BDT:Y6 blend films with thermal annealing (Fig. 5i–l) showed well-defined nanofibrils and flocculent features in TEM measurements. For PBDT-BDT:PC61BM blend films treated with the additive, a well-distributed network structure accompanied by a suitable domain size was formed, which is consistent with the results of the AFM morphology. In addition, annealing treatment can improve the domain purity of PBDT-BDT:Y6-based active layers, which is responsible for the enhancement of free charge migration, supporting high Jsc and FF.47

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, a new benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene unit with triphenylamine (TPA)-conjugated side chains was designed and synthesized as an electron-donating building block for two-dimensional D–D type wide-bandgap polymers PBDT-BDT. PBDT-BDT shows excellent light-harvesting properties ranging from 300 to 600 nm due to the prolonged conjugation of the side groups, which is complementary to the absorption region of the non-fullerene acceptor Y6 covering the broad ultraviolet-visible and NIR range. With the non-fullerene acceptor Y6, the PBDT-BDT:Y6 device after thermal annealing achieved a PCE of 12.26% with a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 21.58 mA cm−2 and a FF of 71%, while the as-cast PBDT-BDT:Y6 device obtained a PCE of 10.56% with relatively low Jsc and FF. Moreover, in OSCs with PC61BM as the acceptor, the PBDT-BDT:PC61BM device with the additive also shows a higher PCE of 6.33% than the as-cast device. The PBDT-BDT:Y6 films with thermal annealing exhibited more suitable phase separation for efficient exciton dissociation and collection, resulting in simultaneously enhanced Jsc and FF in comparison to those of the as-cast blend film. We believe that the BDT unit forming suitable conjugated side chains in combination with electron-donating building blocks for maintaining the donor–donor polymer backbone is an effective strategy for designing high-efficiency two-dimensional wide-bandgap polymers.
