    , Accepted 13th September 2017First published on 14th September 2017AbstractThe monolithic perovskite films with a single crystal cross profile are considered to be the ideal active layer for high efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) owing to the minimization of defects and the maximization of charge carrier mobility. To date, how to prepare a high-quality monolithic perovskite film is still a challenge for PSCs. Here, we demonstrated a combined method via CH3NH3Cl (MACl) coordination and a heat assisted process (HAP) to grow a compact monolithic CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) film with an average grain size of 3.6 μm. The ordered intermediate phase framework of MAPbIxCly grew up from the bottom to the top on the heated substrate, avoiding the grain boundaries and pin-holes in the cross profile. According to the space charge limited current (SCLC), the trap density in the monolithic film was nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of the control samples, while the charge carrier mobility increased to 22.74 cm2 V−1 S−1, approaching that of the MAPbI3 single crystal. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs is increased from 13.26% to 18.34%. These results shed light on the preparation of high quality monolithic MAPbI3 films via retarding crystallization (MACl additive) and increasing the nucleation rate (HAP).
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted intensive interest due to their suitable band gap,1–3 low exciton binding energy4–6 and long electron–hole diffusion length.7,8 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite solar cells has been increased from 3.8% to 22.1%.9,10 Not only have organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites achieved gratifying progress, but inorganic perovskites have also developed fast.11–14 The configuration of the PSCs is normally constituted by an FTO/electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL)/electrode (Au or Ag).15,16 As an active layer, the quality of the perovskite film (for example, grain size, coverage and crystallinity) is most closely related to the performance of the solar cells. In the past few years, many research studies have concentrated on improving the coverage and crystallinity of the perovskite films.17,18 It is generally believed that the grain boundaries in the perovskite film may cause charge carrier scattering and trap recombination.19 In accordance with the working principle of the solar cells, the charge carriers usually transport or transfer along the cross section of the perovskite film. Therefore, the monolithic perovskite films with a single crystal cross profile are considered to be the ideal active layer for the solar cells owing to their low trap density and high charge carrier mobility. However, how to prepare a monolithic perovskite film is still a challenge for PSCs.
Retarding crystallization and increasing the nucleation rate are generally recognized as the effective approaches for controlling the perovskite morphology to improve the quality of the perovskite film. For example, the crystallization rate of PbI2 can be delayed by adding an additive that coordinates with Pb2+ to form the intermediate phase. The intermediate phase transforms into the perovskite phase gradually with the removal of solvents (such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)). So, the morphology, grain size and coverage of the perovskite film can be adjusted by controlling the delivery speed of PbI2.20–22 Only coordination additives (such as DMSO, N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone) cannot realize the fabrication of the monolithic film despite improving the coverage of the film.23,24 Among the methods of increasing the nucleation rate, the anti-solvent process (ASP) can make the DMF be partially extracted by the anti-solvent in an extremely short time.25 The use of anti-solvents is helpful to fabricate the compact perovskite film for high efficiency PSCs. However, the solvent on the upper part of the precursor solution is rapidly extracted; a dense perovskite film is first formed, which prevents the penetration of the anti-solvent, leading to the formation of shrinkage holes at the bottom of the perovskite layer. Besides, the toxicity of the anti-solvents would hinder the industrial application.26 As another method of increasing the nucleation rate, a heat assisted process (HAP) could overcome the shrinkage holes at the bottom of the film because the solvent will be quickly evaporated from the bottom. The perovskite crystals grow up fast from the heated substrate to form large size grains. However, the large grains prepared by HAP were also composed of small grains or leaf-like pattern crystals.27 Based on the above findings, the monolithic perovskite film is difficult to obtain by adopting only one process of retarding crystallization or increasing the nucleation rate.
Herein, retarding the crystallization (MACl additive) and increasing the nucleation rate (HAP) were combined to prepare a compact monolithic CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) film with a grain size of ∼3.6 μm. There were no grain boundaries along the cross profile of the MAPbI3 film from the top to bottom. According to the space charge limited current (SCLC), the higher charge carrier mobility and lower trap density had been proved in the monolithic MAPbI3 films. As a result, the highest PCE of 18.34% and average PCE of 17.41% of the solar cells assembled using the monolithic film were obtained, which are much greater than those of the reference device (the highest and average PCEs of 13.26% and 11.12%, respectively).
Experimental section
Materials synthesis and perovskite film fabrication
CH3NH3I (MAI, 99.999%), PbI2 (99.999%), MACl (99.999%) and DMF (99.8%) were purchased from the Yingkou You Xuan Trade CO., LTD. All the remaining chemical medicine and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The standard precursor solution was prepared in a glovebox by dissolving the MAI (190.8 mg) and PbI2 (553.2 mg) in DMF (1 mL). As for MACl coordination with a heat assisted process (MACl–HAP), MACl (40.5 mg) was added to the standard precursor solution. The precursor solution was stirred for 1–2 h and aged for 12 h before spin coating. The FTO substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water, ethanol, and acetone successively. The as-cleaned substrates were heated in an oven at 60 °C for 1 h followed by the UV–ozone treatment for 10 min. The TiO2 electron transport layer was deposited on the FTO substrate at 450 °C by a spray pyrolysis method.28,29 For MACl–HAP, the substrates were heated for 10 min at the different temperatures (70, 90 and 110 °C). Then, the perovskite precursor solution (45 μL) was spin coated onto the FTO substrates at 6000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 30 min to promote the crystal growth and eliminate the by-product. As for ASP, the anti-solvent was added at 6 s during the spin-coating process. The hole transfer layer was spin-coated using chlorobenzene solution containing Spiro-MeOTAD (72.3 mg mL−1), tertbutyl pyridine (28.8 μL mL−1) and li-TFSI solution (17.5 μL mL−1) at 4000 rpm for 30 s.20 Finally, an Au counter electrode was formed by thermal evaporation. The active area was 0.1057 cm2.
Perovskite film characterization
A cold field emission scanning electron microscope (SU8020, Hitachi) was used to characterize the morphology of the MAPbI3 film. The process of crystal growth and transformation was analyzed by an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical, the Netherlands) with a monochromatic Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.54056 Å) and an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu).
Device characterization
The space charge limited current (SCLC) was obtained by a 2400 Source Meter in a dark environment, under bias from 0.008 V to 2 V. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the devices was performed using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium). The J–V curves and stabilized Jsc were recorded using a digital source meter (2400, Keithley Instruments Inc.) under 3A grade AM 1.5G simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2) (7-SS1503A, 7 Star Optical Instruments Co., Beijing, China). The incident light intensity was calibrated with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell (Newport, Stratford Inc., 91150 V). The scan rate was 50 mV s−1 and delay time was 0.1 s. The reverse scan was from 1.2 V to −0.05 V, while the forward scan was from −0.05 V to 1.2 V. The incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured by the direct current (DC) mode using a custom measurement system consisting of a 150 W Xenon lamp (7ILX150A, 7 Star Optical Instruments Co., Beijing, China), a monochromator (7ISW30, 7 Star Optical Instruments Co., Beijing, China) and a digital source meter (2400, Keithley Instruments Inc.). These characterizations of the PSCs without encapsulation were carried out under ambient air conditions.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the formation of the multilayer and monolithic perovskite films by ASP and MACl–HAP, respectively. As for ASP, DMF can be rapidly extracted by the anti-solvent in an extremely short time, which can induce the fast nucleation. Then, the crystal nuclei grow up to form a dense perovskite film from the upper part of the precursor solution. However, the compact perovskite film may hinder the penetration of the anti-solvent, leading to the formation of shrinkage voids at the bottom of the perovskite layer, while the perovskite crystals prepared by HAP grow up from the heated substrate, avoiding the shrinkage voids at the bottom of the perovskite layer. The morphology and coverage of the electron transfer layer are shown in Fig. S1.† Fig. S2† shows the SEM images of the MAPbI3 film prepared by HAP with the PbI2·DMF·MAI precursor solution. The films show microscale crystalline grains with a unique leaf-like pattern radiating from the center of the grain. However, under high magnification, it can be seen that the large grains still consist of many small particles around 200 nm. Therefore, this suggests that the monolithic perovskite film composed of large grains is difficult to obtain by adopting only the heat assisted process. Inspired by our previous study,20 the introduction of MACl into the precursor solution effectively retards the crystallization of perovskite via coordination interaction. So we combine CH3NH3Cl (MACl) coordination and a heat assisted process (MACl–HAP) to grow the monolithic perovskite film. As for MACl–HAP, the coordination complexes were formed by the coordination of MACl with PbI2·DMF·MAI in the precursor solution. With the removal of solvent, the coordination complexes turned into the intermediate frameworks, which grow up quickly from the bottom to the top of substrate depending on the high temperature. Thus, a monolithic film was obtained as shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the top-view SEM images of the annealed perovskite films prepared by ASP and MACl–HAP (at 90 °C), respectively. It can be seen that the average grain size of the ASP film is about 200 nm. In contrast, a compact perovskite film with an average grain size of 3.6 μm is obtained by MACl–HAP. We also investigated the effect of the different concentrations of MACl on the perovskite morphology, as shown in Fig. S3.† As the concentration of MACl increases, the grain size becomes larger and the pin-holes/voids increase. So, the best concentration of MACl is 0.5 M. Moreover, we investigated the effect of temperature on the perovskite morphology as shown in Fig. S4(b)–(d).† We can clearly see that the average grain size shows the positive correlation with the temperature, ranging from 2.3 μm for 70 °C to 3.6 μm for 90 °C and further to 5.0 μm for 110 °C. As shown in Fig. S4(j)–(l),† when the temperature increases, the thickness of the perovskite layer also increases from 350 nm to 600 nm with the increase of temperature. The thicker perovskite films composed of large grains are desirable to achieve enhanced external quantum efficiency. Because the growth rate is much faster than the nucleation rate at higher temperature, there are visible voids on the perovskite film. Moreover, much white precipitate appears on the surface of perovskite grains, which should be attributed to the inhomogeneous component distribution of the intermediate phase caused by the too fast removal of solvent. So, the best HAP temperature is 90 °C. Fig. 2(c) and (d) show the cross-sectional SEM images of MAPbI3 films prepared by ASP and MACl–HAP, respectively. The SEM image of the cross-section of the ASP film clear displays that the perovskite film is multilayered, which is stacked with perovskite grains. In contrast, the SEM image of the MACl–HAP film demonstrates that the film is monolithic. It is also a compact and contraction cavities free film according to the cross sectional SEM image, as shown in Fig. S5.† There are no grain boundaries along the cross section of the perovskite film from the top to the bottom, which is in agreement with the deduction as discussed above.

Fig. 3 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and UV-vis absorbance spectra of the intermediate phase crystallization evolution as a function of annealing time. We compared the perovskite films prepared by MACl–RT and MACl–HAP to understand the formation process of the intermediate phase framework. For MACl–RT, the strong diffraction peak at 15.6° can be assigned to the MAPbCl3 phase after annealing for 1 min. Prolonging the annealing time, the intensity of the MAPbCl3 diffraction peak decreases, while the intensity of the diffraction peak at 12.1° (MAPbIxCly intermediate phase) increases first and then decreases. The formation of the MAPbCl3 and MAPbIxCly phases is attributed to the coordination of MACl with PbI2·DMF·MAI. Due to the smaller ionic radius and stronger electronegativity of Cl− than those of I−, Cl− is more likely to combine with MA+ and Pb2+ to form MAPbCl3. The phase transformation undergoes the following process: MACl + PbI2·DMF·MAI → MAPbCl3 + PbI2·DMF·MAI → MAPbIxCly → MAPbI3. For the MACl–HAP film, there are weak MAPbCl3 diffraction peaks during the annealing process. The intensity of the MAPbIxCly diffraction peak at 12.1° is highest at the early annealing process. With the annealing process, MAPbIxCly transforms gradually to MAPbI3. This demonstrates that the phase transformation of MACl + PbI2·DMF·MAI → MAPbCl3 + PbI2·DMF·MAI → MAPbIxCly is complete after the MACl–HAP spin coating process. As shown in Fig. S6(b),† the MACl–HAP films turned black, while the MACl–RT films remained yellow. Therefore, HAP accelerates the evaporation of DMF and the diffusion speed of MAI to induce the transformation of MACl + PbI2·DMF·MAI → MAPbCl3 + PbI2·DMF·MAI → MAPbIxCly. Meanwhile, the high temperature of the substrate facilitates the growth rate of the coordination complex (MAPbIxCly), leading to the formation of the ordered intermediate phase framework. After the annealing process, both of the MAPbCl3 and MAPbIxCly phases disappear; the pure MAPbI3 perovskite phase is formed as shown in Fig. S7(a).† Due to the orientation effect, the obvious improvements were reflected in the microscopic morphology of the produced perovskite film, which changed from the multilayer perovskite film with small nanoscale grains to the monolayer perovskite film with several micrometer grains.30Fig. 3(c) and (d) show the UV absorption spectra of the films that would further verify the phase transformation according to the change in the optical properties of the films during the annealing process. The absorption peaks at 325 nm and 425 nm wavelength correspond to PbI2 and PbI42−, respectively.31 PbI42− is mainly formed from the coordination complex of MAI and PbI2. For MACl–RT films, the absorbance of PbI2 is higher than that of PbI42−. In contrast, the strong absorbance of PbI42− in the MHAP-film indicates that MACl–HAP accelerates the diffusion speed of MAI to coordinate with PbI2. In comparison with the MACl–RT film, the absorbance of the MACl–HAP film is highly enhanced over the whole wavelength region due to the high quality and increased thickness of the MACl–HAP film. The results are shown in Fig. S7(b).†

The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) under different bias voltages could be used to assess the trap density (ntrap) and charge-carrier mobility (μ) of the perovskite films.31Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the SCLC curves of the perovskite films prepared by ASP and MACl–HAP, respectively. The curves are divided into three different regions. In the range of low voltage, the current increases linearly with the increase of the voltage, indicating an ohmic response. At intermediate voltages, the current exhibited a rapid non-linear increase, indicating the trap-filled limit (TFL), where all the available trap states are filled by the injected carriers.32 The voltage between the ohmic contact and trap-filled regime is known as the trap-filled limit voltage VTFL, determined by the trap states.31–33 Hence, the trap density (ntrap) can be calculated using eqn (1).33 (1)where L is the thickness of the perovskite film, ε is the relative dielectric constant of MAPbI3, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and e is the elementary charge. The VTFL values of MAPbI3 films prepared by ASP and MACl–HAP are 0.94 and 0.34 V, respectively. The corresponding electron trap density is 1.52 × 1016 and 9.68 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The defect density of the MACl–HAP film is much lower than that of the ASP film. The photoluminescence spectra were also used to assess the crystallinity and defect state, as shown in Fig. S8.† At high voltages, the current increases quadratically as voltage in the Child's regime. From this region, the charge carrier mobility can be calculated by the Mott–Gurney law in the single-carrier devices. The mobility can be calculated through eqn (2).34 (2)where μ and V are the mobility and bias voltage, respectively. The mobility of the PSCs prepared by ASP and MACl–HAP is 19.08 cm2 V−1 S−1 and 22.74 cm2 V−1 S−1 (electron), respectively. This is roughly consistent with other reports.35 The MACl–HAP film displays the high charge carrier mobility, approaching to that of the MAPbI3 single crystal.33

The inset picture is the equivalent circuit. 
Ideality factor (n) is usually used to assess the interface charge recombination in the perovskite solar cells.36,37 The n can be obtained by the dependence of the open voltage (Voc) with light intensity (ψ) of the solar cells. At low light intensity (<0.1 sun), the Voc rapidly declines due to the shunt or some trap-assisted recombination.38 When the light intensities are higher than 0.1 sun, a reduction in Voc is observed due to higher interfacial recombination.36,39Fig. 4(c) shows the Voc–ψ curves. The n is calculated by eqn (3).40 (3)
The n of the device based on the MACl–HAP film is 1.09, while the n of the device assembled using the ASP film is 1.61. This demonstrates that the interface charge recombination in the device based on the MACl–HAP film is less than that of the solar cells assembled using the ASP film. The possible reasons are attributed to the fewer interface defects in the contacts between the perovskite monolithic and other layers (HTL and ETL).
In order to further investigate the ability to block carrier recombination, we conducted the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As we reported earlier, the charge recombination could be assessed by the recombination resistance (Rrec).20Rrec reflects the ability to block the charge recombination at the interface between the MAPbI3 and electron transport layers. The high Rrec indicates that the charge is hard to be recombined by traps. The larger Rrec is, the lower the charge recombination is. Fig. 4(d) shows the Nyquist curves of the solar cells at an applied bias of 0.8 V under dark conditions. It can be seen that the Rrec of the MACl–HAP device is 1707 Ω, which is much higher than that of the ASP device (657 Ω). So, less charge recombination is taking place in the MACl–HAP devices due to the high quality of the monolithic perovskite film. The multi-layer ASP film with the shrinkage voids at the bottom of the perovskite layer results in the high interface charge recombination. The high Rrec would also be of help for achieving high charge collection efficiency as well as fill factor of the solar cells.

Fig. 5 shows the (a) current density–voltage (J–V) curves, (b) incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum, (c) stabilized short-circuit photocurrent density of the solar cells and (d) statistics of PCE distribution. The performances of the devices have been measured under 3A grade simulated AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination, which are summarized in Table 1. The champion cell prepared by MACl–HAP presents a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 22.18 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.06 V, and fill factor (FF) of 0.78 to yield a PCE of 18.34%. As a comparison, the champion solar cell assembled using the ASP film shows a Jsc of 17.56 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.02 V, and FF of 0.74 to yield a PCE of 13.26%. The improvement of the PCE roots mainly in the high Jsc and FF, which are associated with the monolithic MAPbI3 film. The enhanced light absorption is also confirmed by the IPCE spectrum as shown in Fig. 5(b). Throughout the entire wavelength range, the IPCE of the device assembled using the MACl–HAP film is higher than that of the reference sample. The integrated photocurrent is improved from 17.01 mA cm−2 (ASP) to 21.43 mA cm−2 (MACl–HAP), which is nearly in agreement with the Jsc from the steady-state measurements as shown in Fig. 5(c). The devices also displayed the stable Jsc of 17.41 mA cm−2 and 22.14 mA cm−2 for the ASP sample and the MACl–HAP sample, respectively, which are close to the values from the J–V curves. The increase in Voc and FF of the MACl–HAP sample may be related to the fewer traps and interface charge recombination due to the high-quality monolithic film prepared by MACl–HAP. The incomplete coverage of the ASP film results in a high interface charge recombination, which deteriorates the fill factor and Voc. The J–V curves in Fig. S9† show that the hysteresis of the MACl–HAP sample with modified PCBM is no more than 2% between reverse and forward scan tests. Fig. S10† shows the normalized PCE of PSCs prepared by ASP and MACl–HAP methods. The long-term stability of PSCs without encapsulation was carried out under 20–30% humidity air conditions. It can be seen that the stability of the device by MACl–HAP is much better than that of the one by ASP; the PCE can retain 80% after being exposed in an ambient environment (20–30% humidity) for 216 h. In our case, the degradation of PCE should be mainly attributed to the reaction between the Ag electrode and the perovskite film due to the diffusion of Ag. As shown in the insert of Fig. S10,† after the long-term air-storage tests, the color of the Ag electrode changed from silver to light yellow for the PSCs prepared from ASP, while it remains silver for the PSCs prepared from HAP–MACl. This indicates that the degradation rate of PSCs prepared from MACl–HAP is suppressed due the high-quality of perovskite films.41,42 To demonstrate the fabrication reproducibility of PSCs, the efficiencies of 40 devices prepared by ASP and MACl–HAP methods with different batches are presented in Fig. 5(d) to assess the average PCE. There is a very small deviation between the highest PCE (18.34%) and average PCE (17.41%) for the MACl–HAP-sample, indicating the good repeatable performance.

Conclusions
By understanding and controlling the morphology of perovskite films originating from retarding crystallization and increasing the nucleation rate, a combined method of coordination and a heat assisted process (MACl–HAP) has been developed to fabricate monolithic and pinhole-free MAPbI3 films with 3.6 μm crystalline grains. The SCLC characterization and ideality factor have demonstrated the excellent performance (such as fewer trap defects and higher charge carrier mobility) of the monolithic film. The highest PCE of 18.34% and average PCE of 17.41% of the solar cells assembled using the monolithic film were obtained, which are much greater than those of the reference device (the highest and average PCEs of 13.26% and 11.12%, respectively). Therefore, the combined process is a promising method to fabricate high efficiency PSCs and opens a new avenue to their scalable fabrication in the near future.
