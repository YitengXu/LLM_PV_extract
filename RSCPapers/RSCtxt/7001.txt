The presence of a greater number of phenothiazine and triazole units increased the molar absorption coefficient and fluorescence quantum yields. In DSSCs, the redox couple doped with first generation triazole based phenothiazine dendrimers showed a higher Voc voltage through the suppression of back electron transfer and exhibited a better power conversion efficiency (η) of 8.6% under 70 mW cm−2 irradiation than the zeroth generation dendrimers.IntroductionDendrimers1 have highly branched and symmetrical structures and have attracted great attention in the past few decades due to their various applications including optical data storage,2 solar cells3 and medical applications.4 Research in the field of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has gained considerable attention during recent years because of the need for developing low cost and efficient solar energy harvesting systems. As the energy obtained from fossil fuels is limited, a possible alternative, solar energy, appears to be very attractive. In 1991 Grätzel introduced DSSCs which have attracted a great deal of interest due to their low cost and relatively high power conversion efficiency.5 The DSSC is a molecular system which consist of a wide band gap nanocrystalline semiconductor photo anode, typically TiO2, an anchored molecular sensitizer such as cis-dithiocynato-N,N-bis(2,2′ bipyridyl-4,4′ dicarboxylic acid)ruthenium(II)dehydrate (N3 dye), a redox electrolyte and a platinized counter electrode. To enhance the power conversion efficiency as well as the stability, the DSSC system needs to be optimized with further substantial improvement. Among the components of DSSCs, the electrolyte plays a key role in energy conversion.6 The precise composition of the (I−/I3−) electrolyte affects the performance of the dye-sensitized solar cell significantly due to the sublimation of iodine. The use of liquid electrolyte suffers from drawbacks such as leakage, evaporation of solvent, and reduced long term stability which decreases the performance of DSSCs.7 Most research groups focus on electrolyte modification in DSSCs.8,9 Hence, DSSCs fabricated with electron rich imine dendrimers as additives could exhibit a high open-circuit voltage through the suppression of back electron transfer.10Recently, Cu(I)-catalyzed11 Huisgen-type 1,3 dipolar cycloaddition, otherwise called a click reaction, has become a very popular approach to perform quantitative ligation of various functional units into different types of dendrimeric architectures.12 Phenothiazine is a well known heterocyclic compound with electron-rich sulfur and nitrogen heteroatoms. It has been used as the electron donor component due to its low reversible oxidation potentials due to the sulfur atom, which can facilitate the hole transport of the carrier.13 Phenothiazine and its derivatives have recently attracted much research interest because of their unique electro-optical properties, resulting in diverse applications such as in light-emitting diodes,14 photovoltaic devices15 and chemiluminescence.16 Moreover, the non-planar phenothiazine ring structure of the dendrimer restricts π-stacking aggregation, which prevents the detrimental pure singlet exciton recombination process.17Recently, we have used dendrimers with pyrene,18 dimethyl isophthalate19 and benzothiazole20 surface groups as additives to improve the open-circuit voltage (Voc). In order to find suitable and efficient dendrimers as additives in the redox couple (I−/I3−) for dye-sensitized solar cells, we report herein the synthesis of phenothiazine dendrimers 1–12 (Fig. 1) with triazole bridging units through a click chemistry approach and their photophysical properties are also investigated. Fig. 1  Molecular structures of phenothiazine dendrimers 1–12. Results and discussionSynthesisThe reaction of one equiv. of phenothiazine 13 with 1.2 equiv. of propargyl bromide in the presence of NaH in DMF for 2 h gave 10-(prop-2-ynyl)-phenothiazine 14 in 72% yield (Scheme 1). Further reaction of 2.0 equiv. of propargylated phenothiazine 14 with 3,5-bis(azidomethyl)phenol under click chemistry conditions using CuSO4·5H2O (5 mol%) and sodium ascorbate (10 mol%) in a mixture of water and THF (1:1) at room temperature for 10 h gave the phenolic dendron 15 in good yield. The phenolic dendron 15 undergoes O-alkylation with 1.2 equiv. propargyl bromide in dry DMF at 60 °C to give acetylenic dendron 16 in 87% yield (Scheme 1). The 1H NMR spectrum of alkyne dendron 16 displayed a triplet at δ 2.36 (J = 1.8 Hz), a doublet at δ 4.41 (J = 1.8 Hz), and two singlets at δ 5.13 and 5.26 for acetylene, benzylic and N-methylene protons, respectively. The aromatic protons appeared in the region of δ 6.39 to 7.22. The 13C NMR spectrum of 16 showed benzylic, N-methylene and propargyl carbons at δ 44.7, 53.6, 55.9, 76.3 and 77.6 in addition to the signals for aromatic carbons. The mass spectrum (ESI) of dendron 16 showed a molecular ion peak at m/z 717.2 (M + H)+. Scheme 1  (i) Propargyl bromide (1.2 equiv.), NaH, DMF, 14 (72%). (ii) 3,5-Bis(azidomethyl)phenol (0.5 equiv.), CuSO4·5H2O (5 mol%), sodium ascorbate (10 mol%), THF:H2O (1:1, v/v), rt, 10 h, 15 (85%). (iii) Propargyl bromide, K2CO3, DMF, 60 °C, 24 h, 16 (87%). In order to investigate the effect of phenothiazine dendritic architecture on the photophysical and solar cell properties, we proposed the synthesis of a zeroth generation phenothiazine dendrimer. Hence, the propargylated phenothiazine 14 was reacted with di, tri and hexa azides 17–22 under Cu(I)-catalysed Huisgen click reaction conditions to give zeroth generation phenothiazine dendrimers 1–6, respectively, in good yields (Scheme 2). In the 1H NMR spectrum, dendrimer 6 showed a set of twelve proton singlets at δ 4.96 and 5.81 for benzylic and N-methylene protons. The traizole proton appeared at δ 8.24 in addition to the aromatic protons. The 13C NMR spectrum of 6 showed two signals at δ 49.1 and 52.7 for benzylic and N-methylene carbons in addition to ten aromatic carbon signals. The mass spectrum (MALDI-TOF) of 6 showed a peak at m/z 1830 (M+) corresponding to the molecular ion. The elemental composition of 6 was further supported from CHN analysis values. Similarly, spectroscopic and analytical methods were also used for the confirmation of the structure of the other phenothiazine–triazole dendrimers 1–5. Scheme 2  (i) CuSO4·5H2O (5 mol%), sodium ascorbate (10 mol%), THF:H2O (1:1, v/v), rt, 10 h, 1 (91%), 2 (92%), 3 (91%), 4 (88%), 5 (82%), and 6 (89%). First generation dendrimers 7–12 were also obtained in good yields by the ‘click’ reaction. The treatment of azides 17–22 with alkyne dendron 16 in the presence of 5 mol% CuSO4·5H2O and 10 mol% sodium ascorbate in THF/H2O (1:1) for 10 h at room temperature gave the phenothiazine dendrimers 7–12 (Scheme 3). In the 1H NMR spectrum, dendrimer 12 displayed four singlets at δ 4.77, 5.02, 5.34 and 5.99 for different types of benzylic, N-methylene and O-methylene protons, a singlet corresponding to twelve protons at δ 7.89 for the protons of the outer triazole moiety adjacent to the phenothiazine unit and a singlet corresponding to six protons at δ 7.84 for the protons of the inner trizole moiety near to the core unit in addition to the signals for the aromatic protons. In the 13C NMR spectrum, dendrimer 12 displayed four signals at δ 43.6, 52.3, 60.9 and δ 78.9 for three types of N-methylene and O-methylene carbons in addition to fifteen aromatic carbon signals. The mass spectrum (QTOF) of 12 showed the molecular ion peak at m/z 4707.4. The elemental composition analysis also further supported the molecular formula of the dendrimer 12. Scheme 3  (i) CuSO4·5H2O (5 mol%), sodium ascorbate (10 mol%), THF:H2O (1:1, v/v), rt, 10 h, 7 (88%), 8 (88%), 9 (91%), 10 (91%), 11 (92%) and 12 (82%). Photophysical studiesThe photophysical properties of the phenothiazine dendrimers 1–12 are listed in Table 1. Fig. 2a and b show the absorption spectra of dendrimers 1–12 in DMF. There is a broad absorption band at 304–311 nm due to the presence of triazole and phenothiazine units. In fact this observation suggests that both the chromophores involving triazole and phenothiazine could be responsible for the broad absorption bands for the dendrimers 1–12. Molar extinction coefficients of the absorption bands increase significantly at a given concentration as the generation of the dendrimer increases. There is no remarkable spectral broadening or spectral shift upon increasing the generation growth of the dendrimers. The relative absorbance in the UV spectrum increases to a small extent upon passing from the zeroth to first generation due to the increase in the number of triazole bridging units as well as phenothiazine surface units.

Fig. 3a and b show the fluorescence spectra of dendrimers 1–12 in DMF and the fluorescence parameters for all the dendrimers are presented in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, upon excitation at 360 nm, the dendrimers 1–12 give an emission band in the range of 439–444 nm due to the triazole and phenothiazine moieties. The fluorescence intensity of the dendrimers increases as the generation increases, which is consistent with the increased number of both fluorophoric triazole and phenothiazine units, otherwise known as the multivalency effect in dendrimer chemistry. The fluorescence quantum yields Φf of dendrimers 1–12 have been measured in DMF using quinine sulphate in 0.1 N H2SO4 as the standard. The quantum yields of dendrimers 1–12 are listed in Table 1. As the generation of the dendrimer increases, the quantum yield also increases consistently. Fig. 3  Fluorescence spectra of chiral dendrimers 1–12 in DMF (1 × 10−6 mol L−1). Solar energy studiesThe efficiency of a dye-sensitized solar cell is related to the TiO2–dye–iodide/triiodide–Pt components. Among these, the redox electrolyte system (I−/I3−) occupies an important role in the power conversion efficiency of a DSSC. The redox couple without organic additives shows a decreased open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current (Jsc). After adding the additive the sublimation of iodine is decreased which in turn increases the Voc and Jsc. In general, amine derivatives form stable molecular complexes with the (I−/I3−) electrolyte system and drastically alter the Voc due to the electron donating properties of the nitrogen lone pair.21 Various organic molecules such as aminopyridine, pyrimidine, pyrrolidinopyridine and pyrrolidinoethylpyridine have been used as additives to increase Voc which eventually increases the solar energy harvesting efficiency (η) of the DSSC.22 The addition of such organic nitrogenous compounds in the redox electrolyte shifts the negative band of TiO2 and enhances the Voc and further results in an increased electron lifetime.23,24Hence, we have designed and synthesized a new series of electron rich phenothiazine dendrimers 1–12 and employed them as additives for DSSCs. Fig. 4a and b show the current–voltage (I–V) curves for the undoped electrolyte system and the doped electrolyte system with the phenothiazine dendrimers 1–12. The photovoltaic performance data of the short-circuit current (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor and the electric energy efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 2. In the present investigation the highest power conversion efficiency of 8.6% was observed when the phenothiazine dendrimer 12 was used as an additive in the DSSC. From the results it is clear that as the dendritic generation increases the power conversion efficiency (η) also increases. Dendrimer 12 has the most highly packed structure among the other zeroth and first generation dendrimers and hence could capture I3− effectively25 and improve the lifetime of the redox couple. Hence, a further improved design of the dendritic generation is possible, and dendrimer 12 as an additive in DSSCs would be potentially better than the other materials.

Optical and dye-sensitized solar cell studies indicate better performance for higher generation dendrimers. DSSC studies clearly reveal that as the number of phenothiazine and triazole units increases in the zeroth and first generation dendrimers, the DSSC performance also increases. Hence, dendrimers of type 12 could be further developed as an excellent additive in DSSCs to further increase the efficiency of the solar energy harvesting system.ExperimentalMaterials and methodsAll the melting points reported were uncorrected and were determined using Toshniwal melting point apparatus by the open capillary tube method.

The dye coated photoelectrode was washed, dried and immediately used for the measurement of solar cell performance. A sandwich type photoelectrochemical cell was used, which was composed of a dye-coated TiO2 photoanode. Platinum coated fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) acted as a counter electrode. The electrolyte solution was injected into the space between photoanode and counter electrode. The electrolyte solution was composed of potassium iodide (KI, 2.2 × 10−5 M); iodine (I2, 3 × 10−6 M), and dendrimer (7.5 × 10−6 M) additives in 10 mL DMF solvent. The photovoltaic properties were measured under simulated solar light at 70 mW cm−2. The photo current–photovoltage (I–V curve) was measured using a BAS 100A electrochemical analyzer. The apparent cell area of the TiO2 photoelectrode was 1 cm2 (1 cm × 1 cm).AcknowledgementsThe authors thank the DST-FIST, New Delhi for the NMR spectral facility offered at the Department of Organic Chemistry, University of Madras.
