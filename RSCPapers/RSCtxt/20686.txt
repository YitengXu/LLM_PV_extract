    , Accepted 1st December 2011First published on 19th January 2012AbstractIn this paper, a computer controlled microreactor to synthesize water soluble CdS and CdS/ZnS nanocrystals with in situ monitoring of the reaction progress is developed. It is based on ceramic tapes and the Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramics technology (LTCC). As well the microsystem set-up, the microreactor fluidic design has also been thoroughly optimized. The final device is based on a hydrodynamic focusing of the reagents followed by a three-dimensional micromixer. This generates monodispersed and stable CdS and core–shell CdS/ZnS nanocrystals of 4.5 and 4.2 nm, respectively, with reproducible optical properties in terms of fluorescence emission wavelengths, bandwidth, and quantum yields, which is a key requirement for their future analytical applications. The synthetic process is also controlled in real time with the integration of an optical detection system for absorbance and fluorescence measurements based on commercial miniaturized optical components. This makes possible the efficient managing of the hydrodynamic variables to obtain the desired colloidal suspension. As a result, a simple, economic, robust and portable microsystem for the well controlled synthesis of CdS and CdS/ZnS nanocrystals is presented. Moreover, the reaction takes place in aqueous medium, thus allowing the direct modular integration of this microreactor in specific analytical microsystems, which require the use of such quantum dots as labels.
Introduction
Inorganic nanocrystalline semiconductors (quantum dots) are one of the most interesting nanomaterials due to their different emission colors caused by their size-dependent properties.1–4 These uncommon properties owing to the quantum size effects make them very suitable for use in multiple applications which include their use in light-emitting devices,5–8 solar cells,9,10 as well as in computing and biological fields.11–15 Their use as luminescent labels in analytical systems is one of their most engaging applications.16–22 In this way, semiconductor nanocrystals can replace the commonly used dyes in a more efficient way, as nanocrystals are not limited by the photobleaching problems that are usually present for organic colorants.23–25
Optical properties of quantum dots depend strongly on their shape and size, which is on the one hand very attractive. However, this can sometimes cause reproducibility problems if their synthesis is not strictly controlled. Thus, closely controlling the synthetic stages of the nanocrystals plays an important role in order to achieve homogeneous particles with the same optical properties.26–29
Automated and miniaturized continuous-flow synthetic methods offer a great advantage over conventional chemical processes,30 and also for the synthesis of nanoparticles.31–35 They take the advantages of miniaturization, reducing significantly the waste of reagents and allowing to better define the reagents addition, the grade of mixture and its concentration. As the whole process can be easily automated, it is possible to control the different parameters of the reaction, and then, to obtain more homogeneous colloidal suspensions. Automation also gives the possibility of synthesizing the required volumes of nanocrystal suspensions, by continuously working and refilling of the reagents.
This paper reports a microreactor based on a ceramic material for the easy and controlled synthesis of water soluble CdS and CdS/ZnS quantum dots with in situ optical characterization. The proposed procedure combines the advantages of the use of a microfluidic system, with the ones derived from the fact that the reaction takes place in aqueous medium. Then, it would be possible to directly attach the microreactor to other analytical microsystems, which require the use of quantum dots as labels (such as in analytical or bioanalytical applications) without intermediate stages of solubilization.36–39 Few other microfluidic systems have been proposed for the synthesis of nanocrystals, which are based on the most common synthetic batch methods. Some of them are based on silicon technology40,41 and consist of patterned microchannels etched or molded in a substrate and sealed by additional substrates. These require special facilities for their prototyping and also a post fabrication process, thus being as a result a slow and expensive prototyping process. Other are based on polymers, which are cheap and easy to manufacture but sometimes present sealing problems and poor chemical and thermal stability.42,43
Since a few years ago, our research group is committed to the use of other materials such as ceramic tapes based on the LTCC technology44–46 with the same philosophy.
This technology enables the construction of multilayered systems, which can also integrate other mechanic, electronic and fluidic components in a single device.47,48 For instance, complex three-dimensional structures such as 3D serpentine passive mixers have been integrated without the need of sophisticated facilities, such as clean rooms. These mixers force convection and, diffusion profiles can be easily obtained. Pre-treatment components, like filters of different diameters, have been also successfully developed. In this sense, other elements such as ion-exchange resins can be integrated in order to eliminate interfering compounds or just to concentrate samples. Moreover, due to the compatibility of the ceramic material with conductive pastes, resistor/thermistor couples can be integrated in those cases requiring a controlled moderate or high temperature to carry out specific reactions such as in bioassays. Regarding detection systems, not only can transparent windows be easily developed to define optical flow cells, but also electrochemical detectors, as screen-printed tracks and electrodes, have also been embedded. All this can be obtained without postfabrication treatments or procedures, allowing fast prototyping at low cost.49,50
On the other hand, the ceramic material is chemically resistant to a wide range of reagents (aqueous or even organic solvents), thus is suitable to perform the syntheses of different types of nanomaterials.
Taking advantage of the fast and easy fabrication of three-dimensional structures, which enable the integration of reactors and detection systems in the same monolithic prototype, a miniaturized optical detection system has been developed and adapted to the microreactor for the real-time absorbance and fluorescence monitoring of the products of the synthesis, obtaining a high performance and portable system for the controlled synthesis of CdS/ZnS nanocrystals.51,52
Experimental
Ceramic device construction
Designs of the different layers were drawn in a CAD program, taking into account that ceramic layers shrink ca. 15% in each axis during the sintering process. Patterns were transferred on ceramic layers (low-temperature co-fired ceramics 951 AX tapes with a thickness of 254 μm supplied by DuPont) with a laser micromachining tool (Protolaser 200).49 Then, the different layers were overlapped and laminated by means of a thermo-compression process, which consists in the application of 3000 psi for 40 s at 90 °C. Finally, they were sintered in an air atmosphere in a programmable box furnace (Carbolite CBCWF11/23P16, Afora, Spain) by applying a temperature profile consisting of 5 stages. A first ramp, where the temperature was increased from room temperature until 350 °C at 2 °C min−1, was applied. Then, 30 min of stabilization at 350 °C were required followed by a second heating ramp until 850 °C at 2 °C min−1. After 30 min more of stabilization, cooling to 25 °C was performed.
Microsystem set-up
Reagents were propelled to the microreactor by syringe pumps (540060 TSE systems) incorporating 1–10 mL glass syringes (Hamilton series GASTIGHT 1000 TLL). The connection between the syringe pumps and the microfluidic system was made using PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) tubes (i.d. 0.9 mm). Three-way isolation valves (NResearch incorporates®) were connected to syringes, which allowed the possibility of refilling. The whole system was computer controlled, therefore reagents dispensing to the microreactor could be easily well defined, by providing the desired flow pattern. To secure the sealing of fluidic connections, o-rings and conic PTFE cones were joined between the PTFE tubes and the microreactor using a homemade connection aluminum piece.53
Reagents and apparatus
All solutions were prepared in double distilled water. Cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate, sodium sulfide, N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine (tiopronin), zinc nitrate hexahydrate and rhodamine 6G were provided by Sigma-Aldrich with a minimal purity of 99.0%. pH was adjusted with a pH meter GL22 (Crison).
A Shimadzu UV-310PC UV-Vis-NIR double-beam scanning spectrophotometer (Kyoto, Japan) was used to record spectra between 800 and 200 nm.
The shape and dimensions of the core of the particles were measured by a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), JEOL 2011 (Tokyo, Japan). The samples were prepared by dipping a copper grid, which was coated with a thin carbon film, in the nanocrystal suspension.
The purification of the colloidal obtained, in order to perform HRTEM measurements, was carried out by centrifugal filtration in 4 ml centrifugal filter devices (CENTRIPLUS YM30, MICROCON, MWCO 30000) at 3000 rpm for 30 min.
Optical system
The components of the measurement absorbance and fluorescence PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) are shown in Fig. 1a, where both systems are drown together but they are actually separated in two modules (Fig. 1b). To ensure the simultaneous measurement of the nanocrystals absorbance and fluorescence, two modulated Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) mounted in two separated PCBs, where two photodetectors are integrated, were used. LEDs from Roithner Lasertechnik XSL-365-5E (Vienna, Austria) had their emission peak at 365 nm, matching with the SPR band of the particles absorbance spectrum and excitation wavelength. They were modulated and controlled by a Data Acquisition Card (DAQ), which generates the two modulating signal for each LED and captures the detected signal to transfer them to a control PC, which process them. The whole system, DAQ and boards, were powered by the computer through the USB connector, simplifying the system.

The DAQ (NI USB-6211 from National Instruments) generates two sine waves at different frequency (f1 and f2) and sends them to the PCBs. The sampling frequency used to generate these waves inside the DAQ was dynamically adjusted to 128 times the highest modulation frequency to avoid problems in the synchronization of the signals inside the DAQ. The sampling frequency of the analog to digital conversion of the signals was fixed to 10 kS s−1 (1 kS s−1 = 1000 samples per second). These raw data are sent to the PC, where they are processed using lock-in amplification to increase the signal to noise ratio and the dynamic range of the measurement. This amplification also allows the use of the detection system in ambient light without interferences.
The light transmitted through the optical windows of the LTCC microreactor was detected by a PIN Hamamatsu S1337-66BR large active area photodiode soldered in front of the absorbance LED. Light absorption generates a fluorescent emission at 540 nm. To measure this fluorescence, another optical window was designed. The excitation LED was tilted 45 degrees from the normal to the microreactor surface to reduce interferences of the light source to the detector, and the rest is avoided by a high pass optical filter with a cut-off wavelength at 500 nm (FEL500 from Thorlabs). An image of the absorbance and fluorescence optical detection systems coupled to the microreactor is showed in Fig. 1b.
Results and discussion
For the synthesis of quantum dots two main routes exist.54 One requires the use of organic solvents and high temperatures in order to decompose organometallic reagents to achieve their rearrangement and forming nanocrystals.55–58 The other, involves the use of greener reagents in aqueous medium using polyphosphates59 or thiols60–62 as stabilizing agents. The first approach requires a later modification procedure in order to solubilize the obtained quantum dots in water for their use in biological and analytical applications, which at the end results in a decrease of their quantum yields.63 The second route is simplest and avoids subsequent modifications, being possible to use the synthesized nanocrystals immediately.
Few syntheses of quantum dots in water have been proposed to date. Most of them involve the use of NaHTe or NaHSe reagents, which have to be formed in situ by the reaction of aluminum or tellurium precursors and H2SO4 under an inert atmosphere, and generate gases, which are undesirable in microfluidic applications. Moreover, refluxes are required at about 100 °C in order to obtain adequate photoluminescent emissions.64–66 Herein, a direct aqueous synthesis, which does not require the in situ formation of the precursor reagents and that does not produce gases, is employed. The method consists of the reaction of cadmium nitrate with sodium sulfide, using tiopronin (TP) as stabilizing agent at room temperature.59,67Tiopronin, a non-natural amino acid, has not only been widely used as a capping agent in the stabilization of such type of nanocrystals, but also in silver and gold colloidal suspensions obtaining well dispersed, uniform metal nanoparticles which are stable for months.68,69 Moreover, it procures solubility in water medium and provides active groups for subsequent on-line reactions, when the nanocrystals are going to be used as labels in analysis systems.70–73
However, the reaction requires a very strict control of kinetics in order to achieve uniform and well dispersed nanocrystals. A key point in the reaction is the first contact of reagents, in order to obtain a supersaturated concentration of reagents in a short time. In this way, seeds of particles are rapidly formed and they grow up slowly by diffusion.74
Microreactors permit an exhaustive kinetic control, enabling fast controllable mass and temperature transfer and thus, are ideal systems for the synthesis of nanocrystals. However, their configuration must be adapted to each synthetic procedure.
The proposed microreactor consists in 3 inlet channels joined in a unique point, where the three reagents meet and are initially mixed. A mixture of cadmium nitrate and tiopronin solutions (previously adjusted to pH 10.0) is inserted in the central inlet channel. At both sides sodium sulfide is flowed in. This configuration allows hydrodynamic focusing, which entails a controllable laminar flow, and therefore, the first contact of reagents can be well defined.75,76 After the confluence point, a three-dimensional serpentine mixer is built to force a chaotic flow, which generates a more efficient mixture.77,78 In this way, diffusion is forced inside the channels and the growth of the crystals is more homogeneous.49
Reagents concentration and hydrodynamic parameters also have an important role in nanocrystals synthesis, as the molar relationship of reagents strongly affects the properties of the obtained nanoparticles. In this case, a mixed solution of 5 mM Cd(NO3)2 and 10 mM of TP was prepared and adjusted to pH 10.0 with NaOH, and a 10 mM solution of Na2S was employed. Syringes were filled with these reagents and after an exhaustive study of the hydrodynamic conditions (continuous/discontinuous and simultaneous/sequential patterns of reagents dosing, volume and flow rate ratios of reagents, among others), the best quantum dots in terms of quantum yield, fluorescence bandwidth, and stability were obtained by mixing at the same flow rate of 0.5 μL s−1 all the reagents with a hydrodynamic focusing configuration. In these conditions, the molar relationship of reagents is 1:2:4 (Cd2+/TP/S2−). The obtained nanocrystals were stable in water and the colloidal solution had a yellow color, which under ultraviolet illumination emitted in the green.

Absorption spectra revealed a maximum absorption band centered at 368 nm (Fig. 2a). Excitation at this wavelength gave a wide emission band centered at 583 nm (Fig. 2b) with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 180 nm. Fluorescence quantum yields (Φf) were calculated relative to rhodamine 6G in water (95%, λexc = 488 nm),79 turning out to be very low (5%).

The shape and dimensions of the core were determined by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), after the colloidal was purified by centrifugation. Images show almost spherical nanocrystals of approximately 4.5 nm (Fig. 2c) after counting an amount of 200 nanoparticles. The electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the selected area (Fig. 2d) shows bright rings at distances of 0.340, 0.251 and 0.193 corresponding to 002, 102 and 103 lattice planes of the hexagonal (wurtzite) crystal structure of CdS (JCPDS no. 01-0780).
In order to improve the fluorescence efficiency, core–shell CdS/ZnS nanoparticles were synthesized.80,81 For this purpose, the configuration of the microreactor was modified to incorporate an additional auxiliary channel for the addition of a zinc nitrate solution. The main channel was also elongated to ensure the reaction of zinc with the previously synthesized CdS nanocrystals. At this point, the introduction of a three-dimentional micromixer could cause the formation of ZnS instead of the desired shell over the CdS quantum dots. In order to achieve slower mass transferences, the elongation consisted in a simple longitudinal channel, where reagents were mixed by diffusion. A schematic of the microreactor is depicted in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  The ceramic microreactor design for the synthesis of core–shell nanocrystals, incorporating the concept of hydrodynamic focusing, a three-dimensional serpentine micromixer for the formation of the core quantum dots and a longitudinal channel for the shell formation. 
The reagents concentration and hydrodynamic parameters of the modified microfluidic reactor were as well optimized in order to also improve the size dispersion of the obtained nanocrystals.
In this case, the best results in terms of quantum yields, FWHM and stability, were obtained using an optimized dosing and mixing protocol with the hydrodynamic focusing configuration in the first confluence point. It consists of a sequential dosage of 0.5 μL of a mixture of 5 mM cadmium nitrate and 10 mM tiopronin solution (adjusted at pH 10.0) every 1 s at 2.5 μL s−1 flow rate in a continuous flow of a 10 mM sodium sulfide solution at 1.25 μL s−1 flow rate, and a continuous flow of a 5 mM zinc nitrate solution at 0.67 μL s−1. In these conditions, a more efficient mixture of the reagents in the initial confluence point is achieved due to the different flow rate of the reagents and the sequential dosing of the cadmium salt. The molar relationship of reagents was approximately 1:2:1.6:10 (Cd2+/TP/Zn2+/S2−). An example of the synthesis optimization is shown in Fig. 4. The dosage volumes and flow rates of cadmium nitrate and sodium sulfide reagents were firstly optimized in order to achieve the higher concentration of nanocrystals and the minimal FWHM.
 Fig. 4  Optimization of the hydrodynamic parameters: influence of the flow rates in the emission wavelength, the FWHM and the intensity of fluorescence. Reagent concentrations and flow rates were of 0.5 μL of a 5 mM cadmium nitrate and 10 mM tiopronin solution (adjusted at pH 10.0) every 1 s at 2.5 μL s−1 flow rate, 10 mM of sodium sulfide solution at 1.25 μL s−1 flow rate, and a 5 mM zinc nitrate solution at 0.67 μL s−1; except for the reagent of study in each case. (a) Influence of cadmium nitrate dosage volume. The tested volumes were 0.08, 0.25, 0.50, 0.70, 0.90 and 1.10 μL. (b) Influence of the sodium sulfide solution flow rate. The tested flow rates were 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75 and 2.00 μL s−1; (c) Influence of zinc nitrate solution flow rate. The tested flow rates were 0.17, 0.33, 0.50, 0.67, 0.83 and 1.00 μL s−1. 
As expected, an increase of the dosage volume of cadmium nitrate or of the flow rate of sodium sulfide solution entailed a displacement of the emission wavelength to higher values (Fig. 4a and b). This is because the concentration of seeds was higher and there were more reagents available to grow. Therefore, bigger nanocrystals were formed. However, for the highest flow rates, wider emission bands were observed, indicating a higher size dispersion of the nanocrystals. This is probably due to the residence time in the microfluidic device, since at the highest flow rates nanocrystals have not enough time to grow inside and part of the reaction takes place outside the microfluidic system, obtaining, as a result, an uncontrolled growth of the nanocrystals. A 0.5 μL of Cd(NO3)2 dosage volume and 1.25 μL s−1 flow rate of Na2S solution provided the minimal FWHM, which means a more uniform colloidal suspension.
The flow rate of the zinc nitrate solution was optimized in order to achieve the highest fluorescence intensity (quantum yield), which is related to the number of layers that cover the core of the nanoparticles. As it can be observed in Fig. 4c, an increase of the zinc nitrate solution flow rate entailed the displacement of the emission wavelength to higher values and the intensity enhance. As has been previously reported,82–84 the fluorescence intensity rises by increasing the number of shell layers, until no improvement is observed. However, too many layers covering the core of the nanocrystal involve a decrease of the quantum yield. A flow rate of 0.67 μL s−1 showed the highest fluorescence intensity with a moderate band width.

Absorption spectra of the synthesized core–shell nanocrystals with the optimized conditions were recorded with the spectrophotometer, revealing a maximum absorption band centered in 363 nm (Fig. 5a). The emission fluorescence spectrum exhibits a band centered at 545 nm of a 165 nm FWHM (Fig. 5b). As can be seen, the discontinuous dispensing of the cadmium salt in the continuous flow of sodium sulfide improves the homogeneity of the synthesized nanoparticles, as is also noticeable in the obtained histogram from HRTEM images.
 Fig. 5  (a) UV-vis and (b) fluorescence emission spectra of the obtained CdS/ZnS nanocrystals, (c) a TEM image of the obtained quantum dots using the ceramic microreactor and (d) a HRTEM image with the lattice fringes highlighted. 
When CdS and CdS/ZnS emission spectra are compared, it is possible to notice the displacement of the emission band to lower wavelengths. This shift is probably due to the slightly different mean size of the nanocrystals, which is confirmed by microscopy measurements.

        HRTEM images show homogeneous nanocrystals with an average size of 4.2 nm (Fig. 5c). The lattice fringes from the HRTEM image (Fig. 5d) indicate crystalline nanoparticles. Quantum yields of the obtained nanocrystals were increased as expected to 27%.
The repeatability of the synthesis was evaluated by comparing the maximum emission fluorescence wavelength and FWHM from ten identical syntheses (Fig. 6). From these results, it can be stated that the media emission wavelength of the synthesis is 540 ± 8 nm and the FWHM is of 170 ± 10 nm.
 Fig. 6  Characterization of the CdS/ZnS synthesis repeatability by the emission fluorescence wavelength and the FWHM. 
The last challenge in order to achieve an automated and controlled system for the nanocrystals synthesis was the integration of the absorbance and fluorescence monitoring system. In this way, any possible variation of the synthetic procedure owing to, for instance, channel obstruction or incorrect dosage of the reagents could be immediately detected and solved.
The microreactor design was again modified to incorporate two optical windows, embedded at the end of the main channel. For this purpose, the main channel carrying the formed nanocrystals was enlarged, widened and brought to the surface of the microfluidic platform, where a 2 mm-diameter round hollow was drilled in all the layers to define an optical flow cell with enlarged optical path. Two transparent glass layers were attached in the top and bottom layers using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), also ensuring the sealing of the detection chamber. This flow cell configuration allowed the real-time monitoring of the chemical reaction process, using as well absorbance as fluorescence signals.
Optical windows were aligned to the LEDs and detectors of the optical system for absorbance and fluorescence measurements. The high pass optical filter was placed behind the window for fluorescence measurements, just before the photodetector.

Fig. 7 shows an example of the recorded absorption and fluorescence measurements at 365 nm during a synthesis, where the dosage of cadmium nitrate was intentionally on-line modified. The three different employed volumes, corresponding to 0.5 μL (the optimized one) (1), 0.25 μL (2) and 0.08 μL (3) can be perfectly distinguished. Both signals (absorbance and fluorescence) have the same tendency, as a decrease in absorbance intensity entails a reduction in its fluorescence. These emission intensity values are different for each of the three employed cadmium dosages; the maximum value corresponding to the higher dispensed volume, the middle with 0.25 μL, and the minimal value with the lower dosage. Likewise, the intensity values are constant when the same dosing conditions are used, demonstrating the repeatability of the obtained colloidal suspension, and there are no drifts in the recording line, showing that there is no dead volume in the optical chamber.
 Fig. 7  Absorbance (a) and fluorescence emission (b) graphics recorded using the miniaturized optical system at different flow rates; 0.5 μL (cadmium dosage volume 1), 0. 25 μL (dosage volume 2) and 0.08 μL (dosage volume 3). 
As the optimized dosage volume gives the higher signal, a decrease in the recording line implies the malfunction of the synthetic procedure, making it feasible to take appropriate actions to solve any problem in the shortest time.
Conclusions
To summarize, an automatic system for the synthesis of CdS/ZnS nanocrystals based on a ceramic microreactor and an on-line optical detection module has been reported in this paper. Since the whole process is automated, the reagents addition and the grade of mixture can be well defined, making it possible to better control the obtained nanocrystals, when compared to batch processes. The approach not only takes the advantages from the automatization, but also from microfluidics. One can control the grade of mixture and diffusion of reagents depending on the size and conformation of the channels, the type of mixers, the confluence point of the reagents and the hydrodynamics. In this sense, by a hydrodynamic focusing of reagents and the introduction of three-dimensional micromixers or simple channels, the different kinetic requirements of the reaction of nanocrystals can be achieved, obtaining in this way reproducible nanoparticles.
The present approach also takes advantages from the LTCC technology, which permits a fast prototyping without the requirement of special facilities or postfabrication steps; resulting in a low cost, rapid and easy fabrication technology. Moreover, the developed integrated absorbance and fluorescence monitoring system provides robustness and autonomy to the device. The system can immediately detect any possible error during the synthetic process, due to for instance, incorrect dosage of reagents, leaks at the joins of the syringes or channel obstructions, and then lead to the possibility of solving them in real time.
In this work, homogeneous, stable and highly reproducible nanocrystals of 4.5 and 4.2 nm (CdS and CdS/ZnS, respectively) have been obtained. The coverage of CdS with ZnS to form the core–shell quantum dots by the modification of the initial microfluidic platform has improved their quantum yield and particle size dispersion. The obtained quantum dots are excellent candidates to be applied in analytical applications as labels because their optical properties are controlled and well defined.
In this sense, this system can be directly integrated in subsequent LTCC microfluidic platforms to develop a lab-on-a-chip with on-line synthesis of the labels.
