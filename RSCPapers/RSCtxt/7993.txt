    , Accepted 16th July 2019First published on 16th July 2019AbstractBiogenic quantum dots (Bio-QDs) with good luminescence properties and inherent biocompatibility are highly desirable for life science studies and hybrid solar-to-chemical production applications, but controlled bio-assembly is still challenging. Here, we report a facile and effective acid stimulation strategy that enables drastically enhanced production of CdSxSe1−x Bio-QDs in Escherichia coli. Lowering the pH from 7.5 to 4.5 resulted in a 25-fold higher Bio-QDs yield within 3.5 hours and significantly improved the Bio-QDs' fluorescence lifetime (133 ns) and quantum yield (7.3%) to a level far greater than those of the existing Bio-QDs. The enhanced Bio-QD production was associated with an increased production of reduced thiols in response to acid stress that trigger reactive oxygen species generation. The abundant reduced thiols in turn stimulated the uptake and transformation of Cd and Se into Bio-QDs. The resulting Bio-QDs, with uniform size (3.3 ± 0.2 nm), outstanding fluorescence properties and high biocompatibility, showed good performance for non-destructive bioimaging of zebrafish in vivo. Our work opens a facile and generally applicable avenue for boosting Bio-QD assembly by imposing appropriate environmental stress, which may bring Bio-QDs a step closer to practical application.
Introduction
At the intersection of biotechnology and nanotechnology, nanomaterials biosynthesis has been under rapid development recently.1,2 Microbial cells offer a natural, green, and low-cost platform for production of various metallic nanomaterials.3,4 In particular, biogenic quantum dots (Bio-QDs) with good photoelectronic properties and inherent biocompatibility are promising for broad-field applications including bioimaging,5,6 biomedical,7 sensitized solar cells,8 detection9 and solar-to-chemical production.10–12 However, due to lack of efficient, facile control strategies, Bio-QD fabrication processes generally suffer from lower synthesis efficiency and inferior product quality than chemical synthesis approaches.
So far, regulation strategies have targeted primarily on strengthening the metabolic activity or relieving the growth stress of Bio-QD synthesizing cells. For example, genetically engineered bacteria were constructed to produce more glutathione synthetase,13 phytochelatin synthase and/or metallothionein14,15 for heavy metal binding. Genetic, metabolic and light-assisted strategies have also been used in our previous studies to increase the intracellular reducing power and reduce thiol levels for boosting Bio-QD assembly.16–18 However, these methods are either too complicated or difficult to apply in practical niches, and the improvement degrees are limited.
Here, we report a novel acid-stimulation strategy to regulate Bio-QD production in Escherichia coli. The peptide glutathione (GSH) plays key roles in the formation of CdSe Bio-QDs from Se and Cd.19,20 Interestingly, acidic stress was found to induce up-regulated expression in several GSH-related genes such as cysK (cysteine synthetase) and gshB (glutathione synthetase), thereby stimulating GSH production.21 Therefore, we hypothesize that moderate acid stress might also stimulate bio-assembly of CdSe QDs, enabling improved assembly of Bio-QDs in a more facile and cost-effective way.
In this work, we examined the assembly rates, yields and properties of Bio-QDs in E. coli cells under different pH conditions, monitored cell viability, and shed light on the acid-responsive Bio-QDs assembly mechanisms. E coli was selected as a model organism for the Bio-QD synthesis because it has a simple, well-elucidated cellular structure and is readily adaptable to large-scale bioproduction applications. The as-prepared Bio-QDs were compared with the reported Bio-QDs and state-of-the-art chemically synthesized QDs in synthesis and application performances. The performance of the resulting Bio-QDs for bioimaging in vivo was tested using larval zebrafish. Zebrafish has been commonly used as a model organism for toxicological and biomedical studies due to its easy cultivation, optical transparency, and high similarities to human tumors at the histological and genomic levels.22 The luminescence performances, fates and biological effects of the Bio-QDs on zebrafish were examined.
Experimental section
Biosynthesis of QDs by Escherichia coli

E. coli strain JM109 was used for the QD synthesis. A single colony was picked from an agar plate and inoculated in 10 mL of Luria–Bertani (LB) medium for 8 h. Then, the cultures were diluted 1:10 with fresh LB medium and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 200 rpm shaking. The cultured cells were collected and washed twice with LB medium, and inoculated into LB medium (pH 4.5). For other synthesized groups, the collected cells were re-suspended into LB media with different pH values. The initial bacterial concentration was controlled by adjusting the optical density at 600 nm to 3.0. Meanwhile, 1 mM sodium selenite was added to perform selenization process. The strain was incubation under aerobic conditions for 5 min at 37 °C with 200 rpm shaking. Thereafter, cadmium chloride (6 mM) was added to the selenized cells and incubated for 3.5 h to facilitate Bio-QD growth and crystallization, The treated cells were collected by centrifugation (6000g, 4 °C, 5 min), and washed twice with 10 mM Tris–Cl buffer solution (pH 7.6).

In vivo characterization of the Bio-QDs

In vivo characterization of the Bio-QDs was conducted according to a previous methods.17 The samples were illuminated under a UV lamp with an excitation wavelength of 302 nm. Fluorescence images were taken using a BX-51 microscope (Olympus Co., Japan) equipped with a 120 W mercury lamp (X-Cite 120 Q). A wideband MWU2 filter (Ex 330–385 nm) and an oil immersion objective (100×) were used to capture the images. Raman characterization was performed using a micro-Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution, Horiba Co., Japan) excited with a 532 nm line of an Ar+ ion laser, and obtained by raster scanning using a 0.3 μm × 0.3 μm aperture. Images of each cell were generated from 10 s integration per Raman spectrum at each location of the laser spot. UV-vis absorption spectra and photoluminescence emission spectra were measured using an Aqualog spectrometer (Horiba Co., Japan). The fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. The concentrations of precursors, with a high Cd-to-Se ratio to favor Bio-QD formation, were selected according to our previous work.6
Purification and characterization of the Bio-QDs
The purification of Bio-QDs was performed according to reported methods.17 The collected bacterial cells were washed and re-suspended in 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.6). Then, an ultrasonic cell disruption system was used to destroy the cells, and after centrifugation the fluorescent supernatant was harvested. The isolated Bio-QDs from the supernatant were treated with proteinase K (100 μg mL−1) and then washed using an Amicon Ultra-15 50 K centrifugal filter device. Subsequently, the purified Bio-QDs were used for in vitro characterization. The HRTEM image and EDS line scanning profiles of the Bio-QDs were recorded on a 2010F electron microscope (JEOL Co., Japan), which was operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Fluorescence lifetime spectra were collected at 575 nm using a fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Co., Japan) with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. FT-IR analysis was performed under transmission mode on an infrared imaging microscope (Nicolet iN10, Thermo Nicolet Co., USA), which is equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled MCT detector. The spectra in the range 4000–800 cm−1 were collected at 4 cm−1 wavenumber resolution and captured with OMNIC Picta software.
X-ray absorption data collection and analysis
The collected synthesized cells were kept in a freezer overnight and freeze dried for 2 days. The obtained powders and the references (CdSe, Se, selenocystine, selenomethionine, and sodium selenite) were characterized using X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. The Se K-edge XAFS were collected in a fluorescence mode using a Si (111) monochromator at the BL14W1 at SSRF (Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility) with a stored electron energy of 3.5 GeV and 300 mA maximum current. The Se K-edge absorption spectra were collected from 12458–13458 eV. The energy was calibrated using Se foil. The incident and fluorescence X-ray intensities were monitored using a standard ion chamber and Lytle-type detector, respectively. The XAFS raw data were analyzed following a reported method using ATHENA and ARTEMIS software.17
Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analyses
ICP-AES analyses were performed to quantify the intracellular and extracellular Cd and Se species. For detection of intracellular Cd and Se, the samples were first washed 5 times using deionized water to remove the absorbed Se and Cd. The collected samples were digested with HNO3/HClO4 (4:1), and then analyzed by ICP-AES (AA800, PerkinElmer Co., USA).
Quantification of selenol, reduced thiol (RSH) and glutathione (GSH)
A specific, sensitive selenol probe was used to detect selenol.23 The selenized cells were mixed with the selenol probe and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The emission fluorescence intensities were measured at a wavelength of 535 nm using 380 nm excitation wavelength. GSH assays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions of the GSH assay kit (Cat. no. S0052, Beyotime institute of Biotechnology, China). The detection principle is an enzymatic recycling process relying on the reaction between GSH and 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). RSH was detected using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) according to a previously reported method.24 This quantification was based on the reaction between 4,4′-dithiodipyridine (4-DPS) and RSH. To determine the intracellular RSH, the synthesized cells were collected, washed and homogenized by ultrasonication. The homogenized cells were treated with 4-DPS and then detected by HPLC. Gene expression was detected using quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR following our previously reported method.16
Reactive oxygen species detection
To assay the intracellular ROS content, 100 μL of synthesized cells were collected and washed using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The washed samples were then incubated in 600 μL PBS medium containing 10 μM 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Beyotime Biotechnology, China). After 30 min incubation at 37 °C, the stained cells were harvested and washed three times with PBS buffer, followed by fluorescence intensity measurements using a fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Co., Japan).
Viability assays
The live/dead staining experiments were conducted by using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and propidium iodide (PI) dyes. The synthesized cells were re-suspended in the DAPI and PI working solutions for 30 min at room temperature. The stained cells were washed and examined by fluorescence microscopy (BX-51, Olympus Co., Japan). Cell viabilities were further assessed by harvesting the synthesized cells in fresh LB medium (1:100) and then incubating them under aerobic conditions at 37 °C with 200 rpm shaking. The OD600 over time was recorded to monitor the bacterial growth.
Live zebrafish imaging
The wild-type AB strains of 9 dpf zebrafish (1:1) were used for imaging. Zebrafish were cultured in E3 medium [5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl2, and 0.33 mM MgSO4 (pH 7.2–7.3)] in a 14 h/10 h light–dark cycle. The culturing temperature was maintained at 28.5 °C. The healthy zebrafish larvae were placed in 24-well culture plates (5 zebrafish in 2 mL of E3 medium per well) and were soaked in media containing different concentrations of QDs (0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, and 25 μg mL−1 in Cd equivalents). All the experiments were conducted in strict accordance with the guidelines and regulations set forth by the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) Animal Resources Center and University Animal Care and Use Committee. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the USTC (Permit Number: USTCACUC1103013). The fluorescence images were acquired using a BX-51 microscope (Olympus Co., Japan) and 10× objective lens. The 3D fluorescence images were acquired using a CLSM (FV-1000, IX2-UCB, Olympus Co., Japan) using a 10× objective of the microscope and a 405 nm semiconductor laser beam.
Determination of Cd and Se body burden
Zebrafish larvae were euthanatized using 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester and washed twice. After removing the excess water, the larvae were re-dispersed in 500 μL 1 M NaOH solution, treated in a boiling water bath for 15 min and cooled down for protein and elemental analyses. Protein analysis was conducted according to the manufacturer's instruction of a micro bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Sangon Biotech Co., China). In addition, 100 μL of digested samples with HNO3/HClO4 (4:1) were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Element 2, Thermo Finnigan Inc., USA) to determine the Cd and Se body burden.
Results and discussion
Acid-stimulated assembly of Bio-QDs
Bio-QDs were synthesized at different pHs and the synthesis process of Bio-QDs was visualized in vivo based on their unique fluorescence properties.17 After 3.5 h cultivation, E. coli cells were harvested for optical property analyses. With the solution pH increased from 3.5 to 10.5, the bacterial culture showed a color shift from reddish orange to yellow and eventually milky white (Fig. 1a). A pH-dependent fluorescence color (under UV irradiation) was also observed, with the strongest yellow fluorescence appearing at pH 4.5 (Fig. 1b). Consistently, the cells at pH 4.5 exhibited the brightest yellow fluorescence under all the tested pH conditions (Fig. 2a, S1†). Fluorophores were formed in the cells only when Cd and Se co-existed in the culture medium (Fig. S2a†), implying both elements were essential components of the fluorophores.

The chemical composition and morphologies of the intracellular yellow fluorophores formed at pH 4.5 were analyzed. Distinct chemical bonds of Cd–Se (203 cm−1 and 406 cm−1) and Cd–S (275 cm−1)25 were identified from the in situ Raman spectrum (Fig. S2b†). The highly overlapped Cd–Se bond (203 cm−1) (Fig. S2c†) and Cd–S bond (275 cm−1) in the single cell Raman mapping (Fig. S2d†) suggests that the CdS and CdSe components were mixed together. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) of the purified fluorophore showed abundant ultrafine, uniform-sized (3.3 ± 0.2 nm) spherical nanoparticles (Fig. 2b, S2f†). The crystal-lattice distance was 0.210 nm (Fig. 2c), a value between those of the (110) plane of CdSe (JCPDS no. 08-0459, 0.207 nm) and CdS (JCPDS no. 41-1049, 0.213 nm). The presence of Cd, Se and S elements was further validated by the X-ray energy-dispersive spectrum (EDS) (Fig. 2d). Altogether, these results confirm the formation of fluorescent CdSxSe1−x Bio-QDs in E. coli at pH 4.5.

The fluorescence properties of the formed Bio-QDs may change with the cell incubation time. Both the absorption and fluorescence peaks showed a slight red-shift over extended incubation times, indicating slightly increased sizes of the Bio-QDs (Fig. 2e and f). With 210 min incubation time, the excitonic peaks at 414 nm and emission peaks at 575 nm matched with those of the CdSe26 and CdS27 QDs. The quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime of the Bio-QDs also increased substantially within the first 2 h of incubation (Fig. 2g and h), suggesting obvious nucleation and growth of the Bio-QDs during this period. After 10.5 h incubation at pH 4.5, the quantum yield reached 7.3% and the fluorescence lifetime of the Bio-QDs reached 133 ± 0.51 ns (Fig. S3, Table S1†), far greater than all the reported Bio-QDs (Table S2†). These fluorescence properties of the Bio-QDs were at comparable levels to their chemically synthesized counterparts.28
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed the presence of colloidal substances on the Bio-QD surface (Fig. S2g†). According to the Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR), the colloidal substances contained abundant functional groups of amides (3293 cm−1, 1651 cm−1, 1541 cm−1, and 1240 cm−1), C–H (2927 cm−1), COOH (1405 cm−1),29 and PO43− (1065 cm−1)30 (Fig. 2i). These results suggest that the Bio-QDs were capped with a protein- and a PO43−-containing layer, which conferred the Bio-QDs good biocompatibility. Notably, the spectra of the samples showed no obvious change over extended incubation times (Fig. S4†), indicating stable surface chemical properties of the Bio-QDs.
Having confirmed the abundant synthesis of CdSxSe1−x Bio-QDs in the E. coli cells at pH 4.5, we next examined whether Bio-QDs were also formed in other pH groups. To minimize the background interference, identical isolation and purification procedures for treatment of cell samples were applied. The absorption and photoluminescence spectra of the purified samples show strong fluorescence signals in the pH 4.5 group and moderate signals in the pH 5.5 group (Fig. 3a and b), indicating small amounts of CdSxSe1−x Bio-QDs were also formed at pH 5.5. By contrast, the Bio-QD synthesis seems to be severely suppressed under other pH conditions.
 Fig. 3  (a) UV-vis absorption and (b) fluorescence emission spectra of the E. coli cells cultivated in different pH LB media (spiked with 1 mM Na2SeO3 and 6 mM CdCl2) for 3.5 h. Fluorescence variations over the synthesis time in the pH 4.5 and 7.5 groups recorded under (c) UV light and (d) fluorescence spectrum. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 325 nm excitation wavelength. 
Notably, the above measurements were conducted at an identical bacterial incubation time of about 3.5 h, which might not be the optimal time for all the pH groups. Therefore, we monitored the time-resolved fluorescence development in the E. coli cells at two representative pHs (4.5 and 7.5, representing the acid-enhanced and environmental pH conditions, respectively) (Fig. 3c and d). The pH 4.5 group showed a markedly rapid synthesis rate, with the fluorophore formed after 0.5 h and the fluorescence intensity peaked after 3 h cultivation. In contrast, the pH 7.5 group only showed faint fluorescence even after prolonging the incubation time to 56 h. Thus, the synthesis rate and yield of Bio-QDs were both simulated significantly under acidic conditions. Moreover, the acid stimulation also improved the quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime of the Bio-QDs (Fig. 4), with the best performance achieved at pH 4.5. Based on the fitting results of the lifetime curve (Fig. S5, Table S1†), the average emission lifetimes of the Bio-QDs obtained at different pHs were (in ascending order): 10.5 (28 ns) < 3.5 (38 ns) < 9.5 (45 ns) < 7.5 (73 ns) < 8.5 (79 ns) < 6.5 (102 ns) < 5.5 (109 ns) < 4.5 (115 ns).

pH-Responsive biotransformation of Cd and Se and involved biomolecules
The suppressed formation of CdSxSe1−x QDs at pHs other than 4.5 suggests that the accumulated Se and Cd in cells should have been transformed into other chemical species. We analyzed Se species in the cells of different pH groups using Se K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy (Fig. 5). The peak position of the normalized X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra is indicative of the Se redox state.17 We observe a distinct peak of CdSe (12661 eV) in the pH 4.5 group (Fig. 5a). The linear combination fitting (LCF) of XANES further revealed the highest Se–Cd content in the pH 4.5 group (56.7%) among others (Fig. 5c, S6, and Table S3†). The largest Se–Cd coordination (2.2) at a distance of 2.59 in the least-squares extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) curve fitting was also recorded at pH 4.5 (Table S4†). In comparison, Se mainly existed as Se0 in E. coli at pH 3.5 and as selenomethionine (SeMet) at pH 6.5 after 3.5 h cultivation (Table S4†). The pH 6.5 group cells showed stable fluorescence intensity at extended cultivation times (Fig. S7†), indicating that the SeMet could not bond with Cd to form the Bio-QDs.

(a) Se K-edge normalized XANES spectra of Se references (Se0, SeCys2: selenocystine, SeMet: selenomethionine, CdSe, and Na2SeO3) and the synthesized cells collected at various incubation pH. (b) Fourier transformed Se K-edge EXAFS k3χ(k) function spectra of references and samples. (c) The Se compound fractions of samples derived from (a) spectra using a linear combination fitting method. 
Selenocystine (SeCys2), a more stable state of selenocysteine (SeCys),31 was detected solely in the pH 4.5 and 5.5 groups (the only two groups with obvious Bio-QD formation), implying that SeCys should serve as a key precursor for the Bio-QD synthesis. This was supported by the fact that the production of a selenol compound (consisting of SeCys) in the cells was significantly increased at pH 4.5 (Fig. 6a). Therefore, the acid-stimulated Bio-QD synthesis was closely related to the enhanced Na2SeO3 reduction and SeCys yield in the cells under acidic conditions.

Both Na2SeO3 reduction and SeCys formation in E. coli rely on GSH.19 We monitored the variations in total GSH (T-GSH, the sum of GSH and its oxidized form) in the cells. The T-GSH content increased almost linearly with decreased pH, peaked at pH 4.5, and then decreased at pH 3.5 (Fig. 6b), indicating that the T-GSH content was positively related to the Bio-QD synthesis process and acid-facilitated production of T-GSH. To unravel the sulfur sources of CdSxSe1−x Bio-QDs, we further monitored the content of reduced thiol (RSH) in the cells. The RSH can effectively trap intracellular metals to form RS-metal complexes and mitigate metal biotoxicity.32 Thus, it can serve as the major sulfur source to facilitate the CdSxSe1−x Bio-QD formation. We observed a synchronized changing trend of intracellular RSH and Bio-QD synthesis yield in response to pH variations (Fig. 6c), confirming that RSH was a critical biological moiety accounting for the Bio-QD synthesis. Previous studies suggest that glutaredoxin, a thiol-containing protein, played a key role in Bio-QD assembly.16 Here, we monitored the expression of the related synthesis gene (grxA) and observed consistent changing trends between the gene expression and Bio-QD synthesis (Fig. 6d). These pieces of evidence further verify the acid-facilitated RSH production for Bio-QD synthesis.
The acidic pH also favored an increased intracellular accumulation of Se and Cd (Fig. 6e and f), which might also contributed to the enhanced Bio-QD production. Here, the increased accumulation of Se at pH 4.5 should be due to changed cell membrane properties. The function groups (phosphoryl, carboxyl and amine groups) in the cell membrane would be protonated and became positively charged at acidic pH to facilitate electrostatic absorption of SeO3−.33 The enhanced Cd2+ accumulation might be assigned to a higher availability of free Cd2+ in the culture medium under acid conditions.34 However, a too low pH (e.g., pH 3.5) would severely lower the bacterial activity and viability (Fig. S7, S8†), thereby also suppressing the Bio-QD formation.
Another notable fact is that the pH 4.5 group showed the highest cell viability (Fig. 7b, S8†) and the greatest recovery efficiency after restoration in metal-free fresh medium (Fig. 7c). This is consistent with the minimal level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), induced by Se and Cd, detected in the pH 4.5 group cells (Fig. 7a). The enhanced Bio-QD formation at acidic pH might play a positive role in alleviating the oxidative stress imposed by Cd and Se exposure.

(b) Cell viability derived from DAPI/PI stained fluorescence images using Image J software. (c) Growth recoveries of cells after treatment with Cd & Se for 3.5 h at different pHs. 
The above results indicate that the acid-facilitated synthesis of Bio-QD synthesis was associated with enhanced Se reduction, RSH production and Se & Cd accumulation. The detailed mechanisms are illustrated in Fig. 8. The acidic pH induces the production of more RSH, which can effectively reduce the intracellular SeO32− and trap the intracellular Cd for detoxification. The interaction between RSH (especially GSH) and SeO32− produces a reactive Se precursor (selenol), which further reacts with Cd to form ⋯Se–Cd–Se⋯. The stimulated RSH also binds with the intracellular Cd to form ⋯S–Cd–S⋯. Here, ⋯S–Cd–S⋯ serves as a scaffold for the formation of CdSxSe1−x QDs. The ⋯Se–Cd–Se⋯ and ⋯S–Cd–S⋯ complexes grow following the Ostwald ripening principle,35 eventually yielding uniform-sized CdSxSe1−x QDs. Besides, the increased Se and Cd accumulation in cells at acidic pH also contributes to the precursor accumulation and formation of more Bio-QDs. As an efficient detoxification mechanism of the cells against heavy metal toxicity, the complex formation in turn favors a high cell viability to enable sustained Bio-QD assembly. All these factors account for the significantly improved Bio-QD synthesis at acidic pH.

In vivo bioimaging of zebrafish
With comparable optical and surface properties to chemical-QDs, the prepared Bio-QDs exhibited outstanding performance for bio-imaging applications. We tested the biotoxicity and bioimaging performance of the as-synthesized Bio-QDs for zebrafish. The larval zebrafish after 10 h exposure to Bio-QDs at doses of 15 μg mL−1 (in equivalent Cd concentration) showed 100% viability, and still maintained 90% viability even at a Bio-QD dosage of 25 μg mL−1 (Fig. 9a), confirming a good biocompatibility of the Bio-QDs.

(b) Confocal fluorescence images of 6 μg mL−1 Bio-QD stained larval zebrafish (left) and 3D reconstructed confocal fluorescence image corresponding to the amplified liver (right). After being soaked in 25 μg mL−1 Bio-QD solution for 5 h, the zebrafish were transferred into fresh medium and the fluorescence images were recorded at times (c) 0 h and (d) 9 h. (e) Variations of Cd and Se body burden in zebrafish over time. 
Next, we tested the feasibility of Bio-QDs as a fluorescent probe for bioimaging of larval zebrafish. The Bio-QDs were chemically stable, as evidenced by the steady surface chemical properties and remaining high fluorescence intensity after 30 min continuous illumination (Fig. S9†), which are important for bio-imaging applications. After 5 h exposure to Bio-QD at different concentrations (from 0 to 10 μg mL−1), the zebrafish were all lighten up in the liver position36 (Fig. S10†). Such a liver-specific accumulation of nanoparticles might be associated with the unique sizes and surface properties of the nanoparticles,37 which favored their retention in the liver. The reconstructed 3D image of the confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) convinced that a high-resolution in vivo visualization of the liver could be achieved by using the Bio-QDs as a label-free fluorescent probe (Fig. 9b).
Unlike many toxic nanoparticles,38 the Bio-QDs showed little long-term impact on the receiving body. The zebrafish exposed to 25 μg mL−1 Bio-QDs exhibited strong fluorescence in the liver region, but the fluorescence intensity gradually faded after transferring the zebrafish into fresh medium and almost completely disappeared after 9 h (Fig. 9c and d). Such a fading fluorescence over time is in line with the gradually decreased Se and Cd contents in the zebrafish body (Fig. 9e), indicating a continuous clearance of the Bio-QDs from the liver likely due to degradation of the capping proteins and consequently the disaggregation of the QD aggregates. The zebrafish were still alive after continued culturing in fresh medium for several days. Therefore, the Bio-QDs were gradually metabolized and removed from the zebrafish body in a safe manner, implying such Bio-QDs hold a great potential for safe applications in living organisms.
Conclusions
We report a pH-stimulated biosynthesis of CdSxSe1−x QDs in E. coli, elucidate the regulation mechanisms, and demonstrate the feasibility of such Bio-QDs for non-invasive, in vivo bioimaging of high-level organisms. Uniform-sized, yellow fluorescent CdSxSe1−x QDs with protein- and phosphate-capping were obtained in our study. Adjusting the pH to 4.5 not only significantly stimulated the synthesis rate and yield of the Bio-QDs than other pH conditions, but also improved the Bio-QD quality to a level comparable with that of chemical-QDs. The quantum yield (7.3%) and fluorescence lifetime (133 ns) far exceeded those of reported Bio-QDs to date. The acid-enhanced Se reduction, RSH production and Se & Cd accumulation were responsible for the improved Bio-QD production. The as-prepared Bio-QDs were successfully used for non-aggressive, liver-targeted bioimaging of zebrafish in vivo. The acid stimulation strategy has great potential to be applied for harvesting metals from acidic wastewater and may be extended to fine-tuned biosynthesis of various metallic nanoparticles. Our work also suggests that moderate environmental stresses such as acidic pH, UV light exposure, osmotic shock, X-radiation, and toxic methylglyoxal treatment, may be favourable for Bio-QD assembly, thus opening opportunities for development of more efficient nanomaterial biofactories.
