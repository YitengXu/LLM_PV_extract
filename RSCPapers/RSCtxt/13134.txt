    , Accepted 2nd August 2022First published on 4th August 2022AbstractFast-response artificial phototropic materials are a promising tool for solar energy utilisation, yet their preparation remains challenging. Herein, we report the so-called photothermal domino strategy for constructing fast-response artificial phototropic materials. In this strategy, photothermal generation, heat conduction and thermal actuation are sequentially optimised by a coordination effect. For the first time, lignin-based organic radicals boosted by this coordination effect are used to significantly enhance photothermal conversion. Interfacial coordination bonds between lignin and an elastomer matrix promote interfacial heat conduction. Light-stimulated thermal actuation is significantly improved by coordination-assisted mechanical training. The prepared biomimetic phototropic material exhibits excellent phototropic ability, with a 2.5 s light-tracking process, showing great application potential for efficient solar energy utilisation. This strategy shows great significance for fabricating high-performance intelligent phototropic materials using widely available, green raw materials.

New concepts
We propose a coordination-assisted photothermal domino strategy for constructing fast-response artificial phototropic materials via sequentially optimizing the photothermal generation, heat conduction and photothermal actuation process. Firstly, the coordination effect can improve the photothermal conversion of lignin. Then, the interfacial coordination bonds between lignin and a polymer matrix could improve the interfacial heat conduction. Finally, after the coordination-assisted mechanical training process, the photothermal actuation is accelerated. This strategy has meaningful breakthroughs: (1) for the first time, lignin-based organic radicals boosted by the coordination effect are demonstrated to efficiently enhance the photothermal conversion capacity (2.3 times enhancement); (2) the interfacial coordination bonds are beneficial for improving the interface thermal conduction between the photothermal agent and the thermally responsive polymer; (3) different from previous thermally responsive polymers whose temperature response windows are restricted by narrow phase-transition temperatures, the response temperature window in this work is significantly broadened by the coordination-assisted mechanical training process. We believe that this strategy not only lays a foundation for the development of high-performance biomass-based photothermal agents, but also provides a comprehensive fundamental understanding of the structure-performance relationship of phototropic materials.

Introduction
Sunlight is the most abundant source of clean energy and its utilisation is crucial for realising net-zero carbon emissions.1 However, the efficiency of sunlight utilisation heavily depends on the incident light angle, whose changes may result in oblique-incidence energy-density loss.2 An ingenious solution in nature is the evolution of intelligent tropic movement, through which the locomotion of biological organs closely follows the directions of environmental stimuli.2 For instance, sunflowers can compensate for energy-density loss by keeping their flower faces perpendicular to the incident sunlight in real time.3 This movement of sunflowers towards sunlight is also called phototropism, a naturally efficient, energy-saving strategy of maximising light harvesting, which has inspired researchers to create artificial phototropic materials.
Bio-inspired artificial phototropic materials, which are designed to follow the movements of light sources, show a wide scope of potential applications in solar vapour generation,2,4 solar power generation5–8 and photocatalytic reactors,9 among others. Although programmed electromechanical devices, such as heliostats, are already being used in these fields, an additional power supply and electromechanical control systems are needed for these devices to achieve tropic movement.10 Artificial phototropic materials are promising because they are powered and controlled directly by light sources and can realise autonomous tropic movement through the negative feedback loop inherent in material–light stimulus interactions.2 For artificial phototropic materials, light can not only be used for spontaneous energy supply but also act as a stimulus signal for tropic movement. For example, a photoresponsive liquid crystal polymer was able to track light at a specific wavelength through the isomerisation of an azobenzene structure inserted into the polymer backbone.11 Photothermally responsive materials consisting of photothermal conversion agents and thermally responsive polymer matrices can also track sunlight.2,6–9 Inspired by the asymmetry of plant growth between illuminated and shaded plant parts, He et al. proposed a general design principle for artificial phototropic materials based on the thermally responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) through reversible asymmetric deformation caused by the phase difference between illuminated and shaded plant parts.2 Reduced graphene oxide, gold nanoparticles and polypyrrole have been utilised as photothermal agents in PNIPAAm. Light tracking can be optimised through reasonable matching between thermally responsive polymer matrices and photothermal conversion agents. However, the temperature response window is restricted by the narrow phase-transition temperature range of polymer matrices, which prolongs the response time and limits the actuation speed of artificial phototropic materials. Thus, the construction of artificial phototropic materials with a wide temperature response window and good light-tracking performance remains challenging.
Traditional carbon-based nanomaterials2,6,9,12 have been widely used in various industrial products, such as carbon black for the car tire industry. It usually has excellent photothermal conversion ability. However, the carbon-based nanomaterials are typically derived from petrochemically derived gases rather than mined minerals and their production always involves an energy-intensive process or environmental issues and has dramatically lower synthetic efficiency,13 which undermines efforts for carbon reduction in phototropic materials. Similar issues are also found in other traditional photothermal conversion agents, such as noble metal nanomaterials,2,5,7 semiconductor nanomaterials4,14,15 and conjugated organic compounds.8,16,17 Recently, organic radicals have drawn attention for having a higher photothermal efficiency compared with precursor molecules without radicals, which is attributed to their enhanced non-radiative migration.18,19 However, most of these organic radicals require complicated synthesis and are derived from petrol sources. Organic radicals from sustainable resources that have photothermal conversion ability are scarce. Therefore, sustainable, environmentally friendly photothermal conversion agents should be developed for artificial phototropic materials.
As a major component in plants, lignin is the most abundant aromatic biopolymer resource on earth, but it is yet to be well utilised despite an annual global lignin production of over 50 million tonnes from the pulping and biorefinery industry.20–22 As industrial lignin is cheaper than carbon black, many researchers use industrial lignin as a cheaper filler for substituting carbon black filler in the rubber industry,23 but rare reports focus on the application of lignin as a functional photothermal agent in polymer materials. The strong π–π interaction of lignin can trigger photothermal conversion.24,25 Direct blending of lignin and polymers, as inexpensive, sustainable photothermal reagents, has been conducted to create photosensitive actuators,25 demonstrating their potential use in phototropic materials. Nonetheless, pristine lignin has a limited photothermal conversion efficiency and the interfacial heat conduction between lignin and polymers is weak.26 These greatly affect the response speed of the artificial phototropic materials. Thus, the photothermal efficiency of lignin should be urgently enhanced. In a past study, organic semiquinone radicals were stabilised in a polyphenolic lignin matrix under ambient conditions and the findings showed that these semiquinone radicals could be promoted by either oxidation or a basic solution.27 Motivated by these points, we devise an approach in this work that increases the photothermal conversion efficiency of lignin by enhancing the density of lignin-based radicals via a coordination effect.
In the preparation of fast-response artificial phototropic materials, all aspects of photothermal generation, interfacial heat conduction and photothermal actuation need to be optimised. Herein, we propose the so-called photothermal domino strategy, which sequentially optimises all of the above processes through coordination, for constructing fast-response artificial phototropic materials. For the first time, lignin-based organic radicals are enhanced via coordination to improve photothermal conversion. Under the proposed strategy, the light-tracking process of the prepared phototropic material is accelerated to 2.5 s, which is so far the shortest duration achieved by artificial phototropic materials, demonstrating the material's great application potential for solar energy utilisation. In this work, a facile approach built on the coordination-assisted photothermal domino strategy is used to design a biomimetic phototropic material with excellent phototropic characteristics. This study lays a foundation for fabricating high-performance biomimetic phototropic materials using widely available, green raw materials.
Results and discussion
Preparation strategy of artificial phototropic materials based on lignin–polyethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM)
For photothermal-based artificial phototropic materials, the light-tracking process can be divided into three sequential procedures: (1) heat generation on the surfaces of the photothermal agents, (2) interfacial heat conduction from the photothermal agents to the thermally responsive polymer matrices and (3) thermal actuation for the thermally responsive polymers.
Based on these processes, a three-step preparation process was applied to develop a fast-response artificial phototropic material by combining coordination-enhanced photothermal generation, heat conduction and photothermal actuation (Fig. 1a). First, a lignin-based coordination compound was prepared through the ball milling of organometallic ions to promote the photothermal generation of green biomass lignin. Then, the coordination compound was grafted onto the unsaturated double bonds in an EPDM elastomer via reactive banburying to form interfacial coordination bonds between lignin and the EPDM matrix, thereby promoting interfacial heat conduction. Finally, coordination-assisted mechanical training was applied to improve the photothermal actuation performance of the prepared elastomer composite (Fig. 1b).

Coordination-enhanced photothermal conversion
The lignin used in this research is industrial kraft lignin from an alkaline pulping process, which is much cheaper than carbon black that is commonly used for rubber reinforcement (Experimental section, ESI†). The lignin-based coordination compounds were named LxZy, where L stands for lignin, Z for ZDMA and the numbers x and y for the mass parts of lignin and ZDMA, respectively. Biomass lignin is the most abundant aromatic biopolymer in nature and rich in oxygen-containing polar groups; it can efficiently function as natural ligands for the construction of coordination bonds. During the ball milling process, Zn-based coordination bonds formed between the polar groups in the lignin molecules, such as the phenoxy and carboxylate groups in lignin and the methacrylate groups in ZDMA, forming the lignin–ZDMA coordination compounds (Fig. 1b). The formation of coordination bonds is confirmed by the FTIR spectra in Fig. 2a. The absorption peaks at 1705 and 1326 cm−1 were attributed to the stretching vibrations of unconjugated CO and C–O, respectively, in the syringyl unit of lignin.28 With the increase in ZDMA content, both peaks evidently increased in intensity, accompanied by a blueshift from 1326 to 1330 cm−1. These results suggest that a coordination effect formed between the Zn2+ in ZDMA and the oxygen-containing groups in lignin. Moreover, as the ZDMA content increased, the absorption peak at 1114 cm−1, assigned to the aromatic C–H deformation in the syringyl unit of lignin,28 shifted to 1121 cm−1 and grew in intensity. Hence, the electron cloud of the aromatic rings in lignin was influenced by the Zn2+–π coordination interaction. Remarkably, an absorption peak at 1657 cm−1, assigned to the CC stretching vibrations in ZDMA, was observed in compounds L6Z10 and L6Z15, indicating the reactivity of the coordination compounds for a possible grafting reaction.29

(g) Infrared thermal images of P100L6Z15 under 808 nm NIR laser irradiation with different power densities. 
Under the irradiation of an 808 nm near-infrared (NIR) laser with a power density of 0.78 W cm−2, the maximum temperature (Tmax) of the L6Z15 compound rapidly increased from ambient temperature to 180 °C within 20 s and then gradually stabilised at 199 °C, demonstrating an excellent photothermal conversion effect (Fig. S1, ESI†). The effective photothermal conversion per unit mass of lignin was calculated to quantitatively analyse the effect of coordination on the photothermal conversion capacity of lignin. As depicted in Fig. 2b, with the increase in ZDMA content, the effective photothermal conversion of L6Z15 increased by 2.3 times, from 6.9 J g−1 s (pristine lignin) to 16 J g−1 s. On the contrary, the effective photothermal conversion of the mixture L6Z15′ (without ball milling) was only 4.6 J g−1 s. A similar phenomenon was observed under broad-spectrum sunlight irradiation (Fig. S2, ESI†). These results suggest the presence of a special photothermal enhancement mechanism for the coordination effect in the lignin–ZDMA compound system.
The prepared lignin–ZDMA compounds were then grafted onto EPDM backbones, followed by the construction of interfacial coordination bonds between lignin and EPDM (Fig. 1b and Fig. S3a, ESI†). The composite samples were named P100LxZy, where L stands for lignin, Z for ZDMA and the numbers x and y for the mass parts per hundred of EPDM (100 phr). The grafting of ZDMA onto EPDM and the formation of interfacial coordination bonds were verified by the engineering stress–strain behaviour and the FTIR spectra of the composites (Fig. S3b and c, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2c, the interface between the lignin particles and the EPDM matrix in P100L6Z0 was evidently exfoliated. Nevertheless, after the introduction of L6Z15 into the EPDM matrix (P100L6Z15), the said interface became blurry and more cohesive. This suggests that the interfacial coordination bonds improved the interfacial interaction, which aided in the interfacial thermal conduction, as discussed in the following.
The photothermal conversion of the EPDM–lignin–ZDMA composites was also monitored under the irradiation of the 808 nm NIR laser. As illustrated in Fig. 2d, heat was first generated on the surface of lignin under light irradiation and thermal energy was conducted from lignin to the polymer matrix across the interface. Then, the temperature variation of the composites was detected by an infrared imager. As shown in Fig. 2e, under the illumination of the 808 nm laser with a 0.78 W cm−2 power density, the Tmax of P100L6Z15 increased rapidly from room temperature to 100 °C within 20 s, gradually stabilised at about 137 °C within 180 s and then dropped quickly to room temperature when the light source was turned off. By contrast, the photothermal effect was hardly observed in P100L0Z15 (without lignin), indicating that lignin played an indispensable role in the photothermal conversion of the composite material. Interestingly, the Tmax of P100L6Z0 (without ZDMA) was only 117 °C, which was 20 °C lower than that of P100L6Z15. In addition, the photothermal conversion efficiencies of P100L6Z15 and P100L6Z0 were 52.9% and 39.6%, respectively (explanation for DFT calculations and photothermal calculations, ESI†). This could be attributed to the coordination effect between lignin and ZDMA. P100L6Z15′ was prepared by simply mixing ZDMA into the lignin–EPDM composite (instead of being ball milled with lignin), which meant there was no formation of coordination bonds between lignin and ZDMA, to confirm the above inference (Fig. S3b, ESI†). The photothermal curve of P100L6Z15′ roughly overlapped with that of P100L6Z0 (without ZDMA), and the Tmax of P100L6Z15 (without ZDMA) was only 117 °C. Therefore, the excellent photothermal effect of P100L6Z15 originated from lignin itself and benefited from the coordination effect between lignin and ZDMA. Furthermore, the Tmax of P100L6Z15 increased with the light power density from 41 °C (0.10 W cm−2) to 248 °C (1.51 W cm−2), as seen in Fig. 2f and g, and the maximum temperature increment (ΔT) increased linearly with the light power density. Thus, the Tmax of the composites could be precisely controlled by the light power density. P100L6Z15 also had good photothermal stability and thermal stability (Fig. S4, ESI†). Meanwhile, good experimental repeatability was also found for the photothermal conversion of the L6Z15 compound and P100L6Z15 composite after 9 months of storage (Fig. S5, ESI†). These results confirm that the lignin–ZDMA coordination compound endowed the elastomer composite with excellent photothermal conversion properties. A similar phenomenon was observed under broad-spectrum sunlight irradiation (Fig. S6, ESI†).
The photothermal conversion process usually includes light energy absorption and heat generation. As shown in Fig. 3a, the ZDMA powder had no absorption at the wavelength of 530–900 nm and exhibited poor absorption at 280–530 nm. Interestingly, L6Z10 showed stronger UV-vis-NIR light absorption than pristine lignin under irradiation at the wavelength of 280–900 nm, demonstrating that more light energy could be absorbed by L6Z10. As the ZDMA content increased, the light absorption of L6Z15 continued to increase at 280–530 nm. A similar phenomenon was observed in the EPDM–lignin–ZDMA composites (Fig. S7, ESI†). Three possible coordination forms of the lignin–ZDMA compounds were labelled M1, M2 and M3 and analysed by the density functional theory (DFT) method (Fig. 3b). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)/highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of M0, M1, M2 and M3 were −1.27/−6.34, −1.21/−5.86, −1.02/−6.04 and −1.01/−5.99 eV, and their energy band gaps were 5.07, 4.65, 5.02 and 4.98 eV, respectively. As shown by M1, M2 and M3, the Zn2+–π coordination interaction could decrease the band gap for the electron transition from the HOMO to the LUMO in the lignin molecules; hence, the process from photon absorption to electron transition in the lignin–ZDMA coordination compounds could be triggered more easily than in pristine lignin under light illumination.30

(c) The EPR spectra and radical concentrations of lignin, L6Z10 and L6Z15 in the solid state (radical concentration unit: spins per mm−3). 
Heat was generated when the excited electrons transited from the LUMO state to the HOMO state, accompanied by non-thermal radiative transition. As organic radicals can promote heat generation by restricting non-thermal radiative transition,19,30 the semiquinone radicals were stable in the polyphenolic lignin matrix.27 Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was therefore performed to characterise the radical spin signal in the coordination compounds. The signal at a g-value of 2.005 verified the existence of organic semiquinone radicals from lignin (Fig. 3c).27,31 After ZDMA was incorporated, the signal intensity increased significantly. The radical density of L6Z10 increased by 16 times, from 3.26 × 1013 spins per mm−3 in lignin to 5.31 × 1014 spins per mm−3, indicating that the coordination effect of ZDMA could significantly promote the generation of radicals from lignin. It was reported that the semichinone of lignin could convert into other substances, such as semiquinone radical anions, quinone and hydroquinone, and these conversion reactions were reversible.31 The intensity of the semiquinone radical was significantly increased when ZDMA was incorporated, indicating that the coordination effect could stabilize the semiquinone radical and promote the reaction equilibrium towards the generation of semiquinone radicals (Fig. 3c inset shows the mechanism), thus promoting the light adsorption. The radical density further increased after light irradiation (Fig. S8, ESI†). The radical density slightly decreased when the ZDMA loading was increased to 15 phr, indicating that a certain number of radicals were quenched in L6Z15, which might have produced extra heat compared with that in L6Z10, as verified in Fig. 2b. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), L615 and L6Z10 exhibited poor fluorescence emission compared with the lignin–ZDMA mixture. Thus, the organic radicals in the coordination compounds could restrict the non-thermal radiative transition, followed by the magnification of the heat generation process. The doping of ZDMA promoted the semiquinone radical generation in lignin through the Zn2+–π coordination interaction, which restricted the non-thermal radiative transition process and enhanced the photothermal conversion performance relative to that of pristine lignin.
Once the photothermal agents were incorporated into the thermally responsive polymer, the photothermal performance of the polymer became dependent on the interfacial thermal conduction between the photothermal agents and the polymer matrix besides photothermal generation.2,4–9,11,26 According to the model of thermal contact conductance (TCC) established by Przemysław et al.,32  where heef represents the effective TCC coefficient, α stands for the real contact area fraction, hloc is the local TCC coefficient, Sm represents the unit mean spacing of two contact surfaces and keq is the equivalent thermal conductivity of two contact materials. As shown in Fig. 2c and Fig. S9 (ESI†), the incorporation of coordination bonds could improve the interfacial interaction between lignin and EPDM. This enlarged the interfacial contact area (α↑ Sm↓, and hloc↑), which increased the TCC (heef↑) and facilitated the heat transfer from lignin to the EPDM matrix over time (additional details are depicted in Fig. S10, ESI†).
According to the above analysis, the coordination bonds not only promoted the photothermal generation of lignin through the Zn2+–π coordination interaction but also facilitated interfacial heat conduction from lignin to the polymer matrix through the said interaction, thus improving the final photothermal performance of the composites (Fig. 4).

Coordination-enhanced photothermal actuation
As dynamic chemical bonds that differ from conventional covalent bonds, interfacial coordination bonds can reversibly rupture and reform under external force.33–35 Inspired by the self-strengthening of skeletal muscles by physical training, the lignin–EPDM composite P100L6Z15 was subjected to mechanical training to rearrange its interfacial coordination bonds and promote the orientation of its rubber chain segments (Fig. S11, ESI†).36 The residual strain of P100L6Z15 after mechanical training was evident and increased with the training strain (Fig. 5a), which indicated that some of the rubber chains were prevented from recovering to their most probable configurations (high-entropy state) and were oriented along the pre-stretching direction after the training.37 That is, the mechanical training resulted in an entropy reduction of the rubber chains. The oriented, low-entropy rubber chains were stabilised at room temperature with the assistance of the interfacial coordination bonds, which promoted the actuation and phototropic performance of the sample, as discussed in the following.
 Fig. 5  (a) Residual strain of P100L6Z15 elastomer composites after 250 cycles of mechanical training under different training strains. (b) Schematic graph of the reversible actuation effect of P100L6Z15@600%. (c) Strain variations in isoforce mode of P100L6Z15, P100L6Z0@600% and P100L6Z15@600% against temperature. (d) Length changes during photothermal actuation of P100L6Z15@600% (20 mg) bearing a load of 205 g, which was 10000 times its weight. 
As the mechanical training reduced the entropy of the sample and stabilised a part of its chain orientation along the pre-stretching direction under a high training strain, the reciprocating movements of P100L6Z15@600% (mechanical training at 600% strain) were explored. The reversible actuation strain of P100L6Z15@600% reached 39% (Fig. S12c, ESI†), but only 16% and 22% were observed for P100L6Z15 (without mechanical training) and P100L6Z0@600% (without coordination effect), respectively (Fig. S12d and e, respectively, ESI†). Hence, entropy reduction induced by coordination-assisted mechanical training effectively improved the actuation strain. The mechanism of this thermally induced reversible actuation performance was attributed to the following: during heating, the crystallites melted, the oriented chain segments contracted into random coils due to the entropic elasticity and these random coils elongated back to the orientation state along with the external force direction in the cooling process (Fig. 5b).37
Strain variation was plotted against temperature during a heating–cooling cycle to further understand the effect of coordination-assisted mechanical training on the temperature response window. As depicted in Fig. 5c, P100L6Z15 and P100L6Z0@600% showed little strain variations until the temperature was near the melting point of 35 °C. On the contrary, P100L6Z15@600% exhibited a large strain variation as the temperature was varied from −30 °C to 55 °C, indicating that the coordination-assisted mechanical training process could broaden the temperature response window. The temperature response window continued to widen from −30 °C to 90 °C as the crosslinking density of P100L6Z15@600% increased (Fig. S13, ESI†). The slopes of the strain–temperature curves suggest that the temperature sensitivity of the actuation strain of P100L6Z15@600% throughout the heating–cooling cycle was higher than those of P100L6Z15 and P100L6Z0@600%. Therefore, the actuation of P100L6Z15@600% was accelerated after coordination-assisted mechanical training. A possible reason is that as a part of the chain orientation was stabilised by interfacial coordination bonds after mechanical training (Fig. 5a), the subsequent entropy reduction could enhance the reversible elongation and contraction and promote the oriented crystallisation along the stretching direction, therefore increasing the crystallisation-induced elongation of the sample.38,39 Hence, the coordination-assisted mechanical training process increased the actuation strain, broadened the temperature response window and enhanced the actuation rate of the material in the heating–cooling cycle.
Due to the lack of remote control and precise manipulation in the thermal stimulation, we further investigated the light-induced actuation performance of the lignin–EPDM composites under stimulation by an 808 nm NIR laser. As shown in Fig. 5d, when a 205 g weight was attached to 20 mg of P100L6Z15@600%, through controllable light-on heating and light-off cooling, it could lift more than 10000 times its own weight at an 18.5% reversible strain, exhibiting excellent workability.
Artificial phototropic performance
The phototropic behaviour of sunflowers is attributed to the asymmetric deformation induced by the distribution gradient of growth factors (such as auxin) between their illuminated and shaded sides.3 As shown in Fig. 6a and Video S1 (ESI†), similar to sunflowers, P100L6Z15@600% (2.8 × 3 × 60 mm) exhibited asymmetric deformation under the stimulation of an 808 nm NIR laser. The phototropic process involved three steps: (1) sensing the incident light through the photothermal conversion of the lignin–ZDMA coordination compound (state 2), (2) bending towards the light due to regional heating and asymmetric deformation (state 3) and (3) turning towards the direction of the incident light (state 4). The light-tracking speed could be regulated by the irradiation power. At the light power of 1.77 W cm−2, the sample finished the light-tracking process within 2.5 s (Fig. S14 and Video S2, ESI†), which is faster than the speed of real sunflowers.3 Compared with recently reported phototropic materials (Table S1, ESI†), the proposed material exhibited a faster light-tracking response.2,4–9,11 The strain evolution in the original length direction (y axis) and its asymmetric deformation across the thickness of the sample were obtained via 2D digital image correlation measurements (Fig. 6b). A gradient distribution of strain formed between the illuminated and shaded sides throughout the light-tracking process, consistent with the gradient distribution of temperature.

The light-tracking mechanism is as follows: under heating by light, a gradient distribution of temperature formed between the illuminated and shaded sides of P100L6Z15@600%, with the illuminated-side (front) temperature being greater than the shaded-side (back) temperature (Fig. 6a). This resulted in a high contraction strain in the illuminated (high-temperature) region due to the entropy elasticity (Fig. 6b), which in turn led to the asymmetric deformation between the illuminated (high-temperature) region and the shaded (low-temperature) region and made the sample bend towards the light source. As soon as P100L6Z15@600% aimed at the light source, it spontaneously terminated the actuation motion because the light heating position shifted from the blending position to the top position; this suggests self-regulated actuation that was modulated by the negative feedback existing in the artificial phototropic material.2
To mimic the real light-tracking behavior of sunflowers under sunlight, the stem-like phototropism actuator P100L6Z15@600% (2.8 × 3 × 50 mm) was used as a simulation of sunflowers to mimic the real light-tracking behaviour of sunflowers under sunlight. A xenon lamp was used as a broad-spectrum light source as a simulation of sunlight. As shown in Fig. 7a and Video S3 (ESI†), under the stimulation of light, the artificial sunflower flipped from −50° (right side) to 0° within 35 s; it then flipped to 66° (left side, towards the light) on the horizontal plane after another 35 s. As the light was completely obstructed by the petals, there was no gradient distribution of temperature between the illuminated and shaded sides. Thus, the artificial sunflower stabilised on the largest surface facing the light source. In addition, it could track the light source by rotating. As shown in Fig. 7b and Video S3 (ESI†), on the vertical plane, the artificial sunflower rotated 60° repeatedly within 60 s to track the light source at the same height. Both the flipping and rotation actuation towards the light source could be performed at least five times, demonstrating the light-tracking flexibility of the artificial phototropic material, P100L6Z15@600%.

(d) Plots of current against angle between incident light and the solar panel for P100L6Z15 and P100L6Z15@600% under 2 sun illumination of the xenon lamp (0.2 W cm−2). 
The potential application of the artificial phototropic material, P100L6Z15@600%, in solar power generation was explored. The stem-like phototropic actuator (2.8 × 9 × 120 mm) was assembled with a solar cell device. As shown in Fig. 7c and Video S4 (ESI†), under the irradiation of the xenon lamp, the device quickly bent from −63° to 75° within 70 s as the output current of the energy cell increased rapidly from 0.2 to 58.3 mA, but no movement was observed in the solar device equipped with P100L6Z15 (Video S5, ESI†). As the incident angle of the xenon lamp decreased, the output current of the phototropic device with P100L6Z15@600% remained constant, but the output current of the non-phototropic device with P100L6Z15 decreased gradually (Fig. 7d). The phototropic device with P100L6Z15@600% effectively compensated for the energy-density loss caused by the variation in the light incident angle, demonstrating its considerable potential in solar energy utilisation. Other solar energy utilisation systems/devices, such as solar thermal collectors and artificial photosynthesis devices, can be integrated with P100L6Z15@600% to adaptively optimise their energy output. Moreover, P100L6Z15@600% had excellent heat and UV ageing resistance (Fig. S15a, ESI†), which are needed by artificial phototropic materials to prevent sunlight-induced damage. Superior heat/light-stimulated self-repair was also achieved by P100L6Z15@600% (Fig. S15b–d, ESI†). These features (ageing resistance and self-repair) can prolong the life span of artificial phototropic materials, thereby decreasing the carbon emissions from the reproduction of artificial phototropic materials (additional details are depicted in Fig. S15, ESI†).
Conclusions
Herein, we propose the so-called photothermal domino strategy for constructing a fast-response biomimetic phototropic material with a wide temperature response window by sequentially optimising photothermal generation, heat conduction and thermal actuation through a coordination effect. For the first time, lignin-based organic radicals boosted by this coordination effect are used to efficiently enhance photothermal conversion. The effective photothermal conversion of lignin was increased by 2.3 times through the Zn2+–π coordination interaction, which decreased the energy band gap for the electron transition from the HOMO to the LUMO in the lignin molecules and the lignin radical-boosted non-radiative transition. Through the grafting of lignin-based coordination compounds onto the EPDM matrix, the interfacial coordination bonds effectively increased the interfacial heat conduction between lignin and the polymer matrix. In addition, after mechanical training, the interfacial coordination bonds promoted the chain alignment and induced entropy reduction inside the lignin–EPDM elastomer composite. This accelerated the heat/photothermal reversible actuation performance of the elastomer, with a broad temperature response window (−30–90 °C). Similar to natural sunflowers, the lignin–EPDM elastomer composite exhibited a phototropic movement through asymmetric deformation caused by the temperature difference between its illuminated and shaded regions. It completed its light-tracking process within 2.5 s, which is faster than the speed of real sunflowers and previously reported artificial phototropic materials. Furthermore, the proposed phototropic material, which is based on lignin–EPDM, exhibited excellent heat and UV ageing resistance and heat/light-stimulated self-repair, which are needed to prolong the life span of artificial phototropic materials.
In conclusion, with the aid of coordination bonds, we enhanced the efficiency of photothermal generation by adjusting the microscopic molecular structure of green photothermal agents. We also promoted the interfacial heat conduction between two mesoscopic phases and accelerated macroscopic thermal actuation by regulating the chain alignment of thermally responsive polymer chains. These consecutive optimization processes are just like the “Domino” effect, with the coordinator as the initial driving force, causing the dominoes to fall down one after another (from photothermal generation to interfacial heat conduction, and then to thermal actuation), until the final goal goes down (fast response phototropic material). “Domino” herein is chosen to express the cooperative function of the coordination effect for photothermal conversion and actuation. Due to the use of the photothermal domino strategy at the multiscale level during photothermal generation, heat conduction and thermal actuation, the comprehensively designed lignin–EPDM elastomer composite exhibited excellent phototropic performance with fast thermal actuation, a broad temperature response window and wide-angle light tracking. We hope that this photothermal domino strategy can be expanded to the preparation of intelligent phototropic materials through industrial scale-up. Aside from providing a method of reducing carbon emissions by efficient light energy utilisation, the proposed domino strategy gives a direction for the high-value utilisation of industrial biomass resources, such as lignin.

New concepts
We propose a coordination-assisted photothermal domino strategy for constructing fast-response artificial phototropic materials via sequentially optimizing the photothermal generation, heat conduction and photothermal actuation process. Firstly, the coordination effect can improve the photothermal conversion of lignin. Then, the interfacial coordination bonds between lignin and a polymer matrix could improve the interfacial heat conduction. Finally, after the coordination-assisted mechanical training process, the photothermal actuation is accelerated. This strategy has meaningful breakthroughs: (1) for the first time, lignin-based organic radicals boosted by the coordination effect are demonstrated to efficiently enhance the photothermal conversion capacity (2.3 times enhancement); (2) the interfacial coordination bonds are beneficial for improving the interface thermal conduction between the photothermal agent and the thermally responsive polymer; (3) different from previous thermally responsive polymers whose temperature response windows are restricted by narrow phase-transition temperatures, the response temperature window in this work is significantly broadened by the coordination-assisted mechanical training process. We believe that this strategy not only lays a foundation for the development of high-performance biomass-based photothermal agents, but also provides a comprehensive fundamental understanding of the structure-performance relationship of phototropic materials.
