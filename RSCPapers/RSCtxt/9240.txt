    , Accepted 4th December 2020First published on 8th December 2020AbstractSignificant breakthroughs have been achieved in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ)-based organic solar cells (OSCs) with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of over 17% upon the development of new cores of non-fullerene acceptors and the isomers that are often produced in the synthesis of the cores. Here, two benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT)-based acceptors, which are isomers with different orientations of the thiophene rings on the backbone, are reported. The different molecular configurations and electron cloud distributions of the isomers were studied using theoretical calculations, which indicate that the isomers have completely different optical properties and various electrochemical energy levels. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) tests showed that the two isomers have different crystalline structures. OSC devices developed from each of the two isomers exhibit significant differences in electron/hole mobilities and packing modes, leading to clearly distinct fill factors (FFs) and short-circuit currents, affecting the PCEs of the final devices. These studies of core isomerism provide some new insights into the configurations of backbones and could assist in the molecular design of new n-type electron acceptors.
Introduction
As a progressive and promising renewable energy technology, OSCs have attracted extensive attention due to their advantages of light-weight, low-cost fabrication, flexibility and large area, which are valuable in building integration, portable electronics and photovoltaic power plants.1–5 The photoactive layer is considered to be the key component of the BHJ-based OSC structure, which usually contains a p-type electron donor and an n-type electron acceptor. The state-of-the-art acceptors are categorized as fullerene-based or non-fullerene-based acceptors (NFA).6–9 In 2015, Zhan and co-workers reported an A–D–A-type molecule, ITIC, based on an indacenobis(dithieno[3,2-b;2′,3′-d]thiophene) core,10 which broke a 20 year monopoly of the use of fullerene-based materials,11–14 and rapidly extended the use of PCEs to 14%.15–18 More recently, Zou and co-workers reported a more promising molecule called Y6, which is an A–DAD–A-type acceptor based on a (dithienothiophen[3,2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole) fused core.19 The use of PCEs based on this type of acceptor have surpassed 17% due to its excellent spectral absorption and lower energy loss.20–24 Design and synthesis of new cores is an effective strategy with which to promote the development of OSCs.
Isomers are often produced in the synthesis of new cores, however, the isomers have different physical and chemical properties which further influence the performance of the OSC devices.25,26 For example, as shown in Fig. 1, Cheng and co-workers reported two isomeric core-based acceptors, FTCT-FIC and FCTT-FIC,27 in which the distances between the side-chains and terminal groups are 10.52 Å for FTCT-FIC and 12.21 Å for FCTT-FIC. Although a shorter separation should lead to the formation of a more ideal J-aggregation, giving red-shifted absorption, the intermolecular packing on the two terminal sides would be hindered in a way that would inhibit charge transfer (CT). An FCTT-FIC with a larger separation would exhibit a PCE higher than 12.23% with better and more balanced mobilities. Zhan and co-workers proved this by studying the relationship between the position of thiophene rings and the performance of OSC devices.28 Similar results are found in ITIC and NFBDT systems.10,29 These results demonstrate that the different positions of the thiophene rings in the cores have a significant effect on the molecular properties and devices based on the cores. However, whereas a comparison of isomers with thiophene rings in different positions has been achieved, the effect of the orientation of the thiophene rings has rarely been studied.
 Fig. 1  Isomeric core modifications of non-fullerene acceptors. 
Two benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT)-based acceptors, BDTtIC-γCl and BDTcIC-γCl have been designed and synthesized. They differ in the orientation of the thiophene rings on the backbone, which can be seen as trans-oriented and cis-oriented,30 respectively. Interestingly, the properties of the two isomers and their derived OSC devices differ significantly. Theoretical calculations show that higher dipole moments (μm) were found in BDTcIC-γCl, and this supports better intermolecular CT for superior FFs.31,32 More importantly, the HOMO and the LUMO of BDTtIC-γCl are localized on an electron-rich backbone and on electron-withdrawing terminal groups, respectively, and this leads to a typical strong CT-like character with a broad symmetrical ‘camel-back’ absorption.33–35 However, the BDTcIC-γCl shows a more red-shifted sharp peak absorption due to the large overlap of its LUMO and HOMO wave functions, which enhances the oscillator strength of the HOMO → LUMO transition, and is good for utilization of photons.33 The time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT; B3LYP/6-31G*) calculation values were consistent with the previously discussed results. Consequently, a much higher short-circuit current (Jsc) of 13.77 mA cm−2 was achieved by the BDTcIC-γCl-based OSC devices which is consistent with the Jcal of 13.62 mA cm−2 observed in an external quantum efficiency (EQE) test. Additionally, the BDTcIC-γCl-based devices possess larger electron/hole mobilities of 4.2 × 10−5 and 5.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a more balanced hole/electron ratio of 1.3, leading to a higher FF of 62.25%. However, the results of a grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) test indicates that more regular and ordered crystalline structures exist in neat BDTcIC-γCl and its blend films due to the greater number of signal peaks and the higher crystal coherence length (CCL),36,37 which is consistent with the higher Jsc and FF values. These results demonstrate that the isomerism resulting from the orientation of the thiophene rings on the backbone have a considerable influence on the distribution of the electron cloud, the optical properties and the molecular packing, thereby further affecting the performance of the OSC devices. This study of core isomerism could provide some guidance for molecular design and development of new n-type electron acceptors.
Results and discussion
The BDTtIC-γCl and BDTcIC-γCl were synthesized by a Knoevenagel condensation reaction between BDT-based cores and an IC-Cl-γ end group,38,39 as shown in Fig. 2, where the IC-Cl-γ was obtained by recrystallization from IC-Cl-m.40,41 The two BDT-based cores were synthesized using previously published cyclization reactions.42,43 They are isomers but differ in the orientation of the thiophene ring on the two sides of the core, one is cis-oriented and the other is trans-oriented. The synthetic routes are shown in Scheme 1 and further synthesis details are provided in the ESI.† Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†) show the results of the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) obtained in the determination of the thermal properties of BDTtIC-γCl and BDTcIC-γCl. It was found that both of these compounds met the thermal requirements for device processing and in addition, they exhibited good solubility in chlorobenzene, chloroform, dichloromethane, and toluene, which can be used for solution processing. The commonly used PBDB-TF (PM6) was chosen as a polymer donor to match with the two acceptors as an active layer of the OSCs, and the chemical structure of PBDB-TF is shown in Scheme S2 (ESI†).

The differences of the molecular configurations and the electronic distributions between BDTtIC-γCl and BDTcIC-γCl were studied by the DFT method of RB3LYP 6-31G(d,p). As shown in Fig. 2, both of the acceptors had a linear structure with an S–OC interlock configuration.44,45 Good molecular coplanarity with dihedral angles of 0.12°/0.33° for BDTtIC-γCl and 0.07°/0.07° for BDTcIC-γCl between terminal groups and cores were observed. The four phenylcycloalkane side chains were sp3 hybridized on either side of the core, which hindered the packing between the cores and lead to J-aggregation by π–π stacking between the terminal groups.41 The calculated dipole moment (μm) of BDTtIC-γCl was 0.15 D and that of BDTcIC-γCl was 1.01 D. The higher μm of BDTcIC-γCl supported it in obtaining better intermolecular CT, leading to a superior FF.46 More importantly, BDTtIC-γCl and BDTcIC-γCl showed obvious differences in the electronic cloud distribution. As shown in Fig. 3, the HOMO and the LUMO of BDTtIC-γCl were localized on the electron-rich backbone and electron-withdrawing terminal groups, respectively, whereas BDTcIC-γCl possessed more delocalized LUMO and HOMO wave functions, resulting in a large overlap between them. The calculated LUMO and HOMO energy level values were −3.28 eV and −5.34 eV for BDTtIC-γCl, and −3.45 eV and −5.40 eV for BDTcIC-γCl, respectively.

The optical properties of BDTtIC-γCl and BDTcIC-γCl were determined by UV-Vis absorption. The two isomers were found to display completely different absorption properties. As shown in Fig. 4a, a typical symmetrical ‘camel-back’ solution absorption with a blue-shifted peak value of 480 nm and a red-shifted peak value of 645 nm was found for BDTtIC-γCl. The reason for this lies in its localized LUMO and HOMO wave functions, leading to a typical strong CT-like character with broad absorption. The red-shifted peak represents a localized transition to a CT state and the blue-shifted peak was ascribed to a delocalized excitonic π–π* transition.33,34 However, BDTcIC-γCl shows a more red-shifted sharp peak absorption at 743 nm because of a large overlap of the LUMO and HOMO wave functions. Consequently, the oscillator strength of the HOMO to LUMO transition should be enhanced by this delocalized electronic cloud distribution.33–35Fig. 4b shows the absorption in the solid state, where maximum absorption peaks at 678 nm and at 791 nm were shown by BDTtIC-γCl and BDTcIC-γCl, respectively. The red-shifted absorptions from solution to film were identified from the J-aggregation behaviors of the two isomers. The red-shifted absorption and higher extinction coefficients (1.33 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1) of BDTcIC-γCl helped to enhance the utilization of photons to obtain a higher current density. This result indicated that the isomerization of the cores has a considerable influence on the optical properties.

To further understand the absorption characteristics of the two isomers, the TD-DFT (B3LYP/6-31G*) calculations were used to investigate the oscillator strengths and the simulated excitation energies of them. As shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†), three different excited states were found in both BDTtIC-γCl and BDTcIC-γCl, where the BDTtIC-γCl exhibited blue-shifted excitation energies of 720.2, 702.9, 548.0 nm with oscillator strengths of 0.473, 0.002, and 0.073, respectively, whereas the excitation energies of 753.3, 626.2, 550.4 nm with corresponding oscillator strengths of 2.139, 0.004, and 0.135, respectively, were found in BDTcIC-γCl. As a result, the red-shifted excitation energy of BDTcIC-γCl from the theoretical calculations was consistent with the experimental data shown in Fig. 4a, and the higher oscillator strength of BDTcIC-γCl agreed well with its delocalized electronic cloud distribution. The electrochemical energy levels of two isomers determined by the CV method are shown in Fig. 4c, where the oxidation–reduction potentials of BDTtIC-γCl and BDTcIC-γCl were 0.75/−0.57 eV and 0.83/−0.45 eV (refer to ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple), respectively, and the corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels were −5.21/−3.89 eV and −5.29/−4.01 eV, respectively, which are shown in Fig. 4d. This trend of energy level variation is consistent with the results of the theoretical calculations.
The OSC devices were fabricated to compare the photovoltaic performance of BDTtIC-γCl with that of BDTcIC-γCl.40,46,49,50Fig. 5a shows the J–V curves of the two isomers. A Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 13.77 mA cm−2, and an FF of 62.25% was found for BDTcIC-γCl, whereas BDTtIC-γCl exhibited a lower Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 2.26 mA cm−2, and an FF of 39.06%. The red-shifted absorption and higher extinction coefficients of the BDTcIC-γCl-based devices were an important reason for the higher current density. Fig. 5b shows the EQE curves of the BDTtIC-γCl- and BDTcIC-γCl-based devices. The corresponding calculated Jcal values were 2.02 mA cm−2 and 13.62 mA cm−2, respectively, which was consistent with the results from the J–V determinations. However, the carrier transport properties of the trans- and cis-acceptors were determined by an SCLC test, as shown in Fig. 5c and d. The BDTcIC-γCl-based devices had an electron mobility of 4.2 × 10−5 and a hole mobility of 5.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas a lower electron mobility of 4.6 × 10−6 and a hole mobility of 7.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 was found for BDTtIC-γCl, and this would lead to a disadvantageous current density. Furthermore, with the inferior hole mobility, an electron ratio of 1.6 for BDTtIC-γCl would lead to a lower FF. These results showed that the core isomerism has a major influence on the CT properties and furthermore affects the performance of the OSC devices.

Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) test results of two isomeric acceptor-based films. It was found from the TEM images that both BDTtIC-γCl and BDTcIC-γCl had obvious fibrillar networks and possessed smooth and uniform morphology with similar root mean square (RMS) deviations of 1.54 and 1.47 nm from the AFM measurements, respectively.47 The corresponding 3D AFM images are shown in Fig. S3c and f (ESI†). The results suggested that the isomerism of the cores had little effect on the film morphologies.
To further visualize the isomer effects on the molecular packing in the solid state, the GIWAXS was conducted on BDTtIC-γCl and BDTcIC-γCl neat and blend films. As shown in Fig. 6, the 2D GIWAXS images exhibit strong intensities in the qz direction, indicating that a dominant face-on orientation exists, in which the (010) scattering peaks in the out of plane (OOP) direction were 1.72 and 1.70 Å−1 for BDTtIC-γCl and BDTcIC-γCl neat films, respectively. These changed to 1.69 and 1.67 Å−1, respectively, after blending with a polymer donor, which corresponded to a negligible difference in the π–π distances of 3.65/3.69 Å for neat films and 3.72/3.76 Å for BDTtIC-γCl and BDTcIC-γCl blend films, respectively. These results demonstrated that the isomeric cores had a negligible influence on intermolecular packing, which was consistent with the previous studies that showed that the intermolecular interactions were mainly determined by terminal groups and formed regular J-aggregates.40,48 However, some differences could be found in the in-plane (IP) direction. In detail, the BDTtIC-γCl neat film exhibited a strong intensity at 0.30 Å−1 in the IP direction with a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.17 Å−1, corresponding to a (100) lamellar distance of 20.93 Å. The CCL along this direction was 36.94 Å, whereas two bands at 0.30 Å−1 and 0.40 Å−1 were found in the IP for the BDTcIC-γCl neat film, corresponding to the (100) and (001) lamellar distances of 20.93 Å and 15.7 Å, respectively. The matching CCL of (100) was 62.82 Å. More signal peaks and higher CCLs, indicated that more regular and ordered crystalline structures existed in BDTcIC-γCl,37 and these supported high charge mobilities. The same relationship was found in the two blend films, implying that a higher Jsc and FF would be realized in the BDTcIC-γCl-based devices. These results demonstrated that isomerism of cores can affect the molecular packing in the IP direction but to some extent, fails to influence the intermolecular stacking in the OPP direction.

Conclusions
Two isomers, BDTtIC-γCl and BDTcIC-γCl, have been synthesized and used to compare the isomerism effect caused by the orientation of the thiophene rings on the backbone. The properties of the two isomers and their OSC devices were found to be significantly different. The HOMO and the LUMO of BDTtIC-γCl are localized on the electron-rich backbone and on the electron-withdrawing terminal groups, respectively, whereas BDTcIC-γCl shows more delocalized LUMO and HOMO wave functions, resulting in large overlap between them; this leads to more red-shifted sharp peak absorption in BDTcIC-γCl and typical symmetrical ‘camel-back’ absorption in BDTtIC-γCl. This is also proved by TD-DFT (B3LYP/6-31G*) calculations. Consequently, a PCE of 7.61% with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 13.77 mA cm−2, and a FF of 62.25% were achieved in BDTcIC-γCl-based OSCs, which is a large improvement from the PCE of 0.71% produced by the BDTtIC-γCl-based OSC. GIWAXS tests indicate that more regular and ordered crystalline structures exist in BDTcIC-γCl neat and blend films, which is consistent with its larger electron and hole mobilities and more balanced hole/electron ratio of 1.3, resulting in a better photoresponse current, higher EQE, and higher FF. These studies of core isomerization could avoid some design failures and enhance the understanding of core design in high-performance non-fullerene acceptors.
