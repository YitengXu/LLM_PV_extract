    , Accepted 11th December 2020First published on 14th December 2020AbstractCu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is a narrow band gap, non-toxic, environmentally friendly semiconductor photocatalytic material. Cu2ZnSnS4 nanoparticles were synthesized by a hydrothermal method at different temperatures. XRD and Raman results showed that CZTS with a high crystallinity kesterite structure was successfully prepared. Photoelectrochemical tests showed that CZTS is a p-type semiconductor with a band gap of 1.5 eV, and its photocurrent density could attain 0.3271 μA cm−2. It was found that CZTS had good photocatalytic activity for RhB via the photocatalysis of Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation with CZTS nanoparticles under visible light. The degradation efficiency of RhB by CZTS reached 98.20% within 90 min, and the degradation rate was about 0.02905 min−1. The photocatalytic degradation mechanism of CZTS was studied through free radical capture experiments, and results showed that photo-generated electrons could react with O2 and H2O in the solution to form ˙OH, which degraded RhB into H2O and CO2.
Introduction
The organic wastewater produced in modern industrial production has caused serious environmental pollution problems. Environmental issues such as pollution require imperative action. This undertaking depends on the human race, as further detriment will be encountered in the future should pollution levels continue to rise.1,2 Photocatalytic technology is a new green sustainable development that demonstrates efficiency and ingenuity.
Semiconductors can be used to convert light energy into chemical energy to degrade organic pollutants in industrial wastewater.3 They can degrade some toxic and harmful organic macromolecular substances, converting them into non-toxic and harmless small molecules, to achieve the purpose of environmental protection.4,5 Traditional photocatalytic materials are primarily oxide semiconductor materials based on TiO26,7 and few sulfides8,9 with semiconductor properties. Although these photocatalytic materials have certain photocatalytic resources, they can only effectively absorb the ultraviolet part of sunlight due to their large band gap. However, ultraviolet light is still less than 5% of the entire solar spectrum, and the light utilization rate is too low, which affects its photocatalytic performance. Moreover, a small number of sulfides are toxic.10,11 It is necessary to search for semiconductor photocatalytic materials with narrow band gaps, non-toxicity, low cost, and green environmental protection.12,13
Research has demonstrated that the synthesis of polysulfides can reduce the band gap to a certain extent.14 For example, the band gap of the ternary sulfide ZnxCd1−xS (Eg ∼ 2.4 eV)15 is smaller than that of the binary sulfide ZnS (Eg ∼ 3.65 eV),16 which expands the light absorption range of semiconductor photocatalysts. The band gaps of some quaternary sulfides can be smaller, which can further expand their light absorption ranges. The quaternary compound semiconductor Cu2ZnSnS4 is a direct band gap semiconductor material with a band gap between 1.3 and 1.6 eV.17 This is very consistent with the solar spectrum, which can effectively absorb visible light and even near-infrared light, and has a high absorption coefficient (about 104 cm−1).18,19 In addition, the constituent elements of Cu2ZnSnS4 are rich in resources and environmentally friendly, among which Cu, Zn, Sn, and S are abundant in the Earth's crust and are basically non-toxic.20,21
There are many ways to prepare Cu2ZnSnS4, and Cu2ZnSnS4 has also received extensive research interest due to its chemical stability.22,23 CZTS has been widely researched and applied to solar cells because of its exceptional performance.24–26 The conversion efficiency of CZTS thin-film solar cells can reach 12.6%.27 Moreover, this semiconductor material has attracted the interest of experts in the field of photocatalysis. In recent years, CZTS has been reported as an effective photocatalyst for the visible light degradation of pollutants and hydrogen production by water splitting. Guo et al. synthesized a well-crystallized layered microstructure of CZTS by a hydrothermal method. After 4 h irradiation, the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of RhB was 51.66%.28 Sampath et al. used a self-made chemical spray pyrolysis device which deposits CZTS films with different molar ratios and used the films as photocatalysts to degrade RhB under visible light. The highest degradation efficiency was 79% within 240 min.29 Burhanuz et al. prepared CZTS nanoparticles by a solvothermal method. Under visible light irradiation, 83% of RhB was degraded within 100 min and showed excellent light stability. At the same time, the material showed excellent electrocatalytic performance in the process of electrocatalytic water splitting.30 Wei et al. prepared flower-like CZTS/Cu2−xS nanoparticles by a solvothermal method; they showed excellent visible light activity and stability. Under the irradiation of a metal halide lamp, the degradation efficiency of RhB within 100 min was 99.8%.31 The advantages of CZTS materials in the field of visible light catalysis, such as narrow band gap, non-toxicity, stability, and low cost, undoubtedly increase its prominence among many semiconductor materials. Due to its application in the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants and hydrogen production by hydrolysis, it is one of the most promising semiconductor materials to solve future energy and environmental problems.32,33 The key of photocatalysis technology is to improve the activity of catalyst materials in the process of photocatalysis.34 Different morphologies of CZTS have different adsorption and degradation rates of organic pollutants. The micromorphology of CZTS can be adjusted by controlling the reaction conditions to obtain improved photocatalysis performance. In this paper, a simple hydrothermal method was used to successfully prepare CZTS with a high crystallinity kesterite structure at 200 °C by changing the reaction temperature of CZTS. The CZTS nanosheets self-assembled into a flower-like structure, which improved the photocatalytic activity. The catalytic degradation effect of CZTS on RhB in solution was studied under visible light, and the potential mechanism of CZTS degradation of RhB was proposed based on free radical capture experiments.
Experimental
Material
All the chemicals and solvents were purchased from Nanjing Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China) and were used without further purification.
Preparation of nanocrystalline CZTS
CZTS was prepared by a hydrothermal method. 2 mM Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 1 mM (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O), 1 mM (SnCl4·4H2O) and 4 mM thiourea were dissolved in distilled water and stirred for 30 min. After the solution was completely dissolved, the liquid was placed into a 50 mL hydrothermal reactor; then, the reactor was placed in a vacuum drying oven and maintained at a specific temperature (160 °C, 180 °C, 200 °C) for 24 h. Finally, the reactants were taken out and washed with absolute ethanol and distilled water three times in a centrifuge. The samples were placed in a constant temperature drying oven at 60 °C for 12 hours.
Measurements and characterization
The crystal structures and phase structures of the powders were analyzed by XRD (Bruker D8-Discover) and Raman spectroscopy (Thermo Fisher DXR2xi ICP-OES). The micromorphologies of the powders were observed by SEM (Hitachi S-4800). The element valence states of the samples were analyzed by XPS (Escalab 250 Xi). The total amounts of organic and inorganic carbon in the solutions were analyzed using a TOC-L analyzer (Shimadzu, Japan).
Photoelectrochemical measurements
A standard three-electrode electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China) was used for photoelectric performance testing. In the three-electrode system, the Ag/AgCl electrode was the reference electrode, the Pt sheet was the counter electrode, and the sample was spin-coated on 1 × 1 cm2 FTO conductive glass as the working electrode. The electrolyte solution was a combined solution of 0.1 M Na2S and 0.2 M NaOH solutions.
Photocatalytic activity measurements
For the photocatalysis experiment, a xenon lamp (150 W, λ > 420 nm) was used as the photocatalytic light source, and the prepared powder sample was used as a compound to catalyze the degradation of RhB. A 10 mg L−1 RhB solution was prepared. For each photocatalysis experiment, 100 mL of RhB solution was measured; then, a 30 mg CZTS sample was added, and the mixture was stirred in a dark environment for 60 minutes. After the system reached adsorption–desorption equilibrium, the xenon lamp was turned on for illumination. After turning on the light, 6 mL of the solution was taken in a centrifuge tube every 10 minutes, and the light was stopped after 90 minutes. Finally, the removed solution was centrifuged in an extractor at 10000 rad min−1 for 3 minutes, and the supernatant was taken for UV-vis spectrum analysis.
By analyzing the UV-vis absorption spectrum, it was discovered that the characteristic absorption peak of RhB was at 553 nm. According to the Lambert–Beer law, the relationship between the solution concentration and absorbance could be obtained: (1)where A is the absorbance, T is the transmittance and is the ratio of the intensity of the outgoing light (I) to the intensity of the incident light (I0), k is the molar absorption coefficient, c is the concentration of the light-absorbing substance, and b is the thickness of the absorption layer.
The solution concentration value could be obtained by formula (1), and the degradation of RhB by photocatalysis over time could be obtained according to formula (2): (2)where η is the degradation efficiency of RhB, c0 is the concentration of rhodamine B solution before light, and ct is the concentration of RhB solution at time t after light.
Results and discussion
SEM analyses

Fig. 1(a–c) displays the SEM images of the CZTS samples prepared by hydrothermal reaction at 160 °C, 180 °C and 200 °C for 24 hours. The results demonstrated that the samples prepared at 160 °C were irregular in shape, disorderly, and contained nanoparticles of different sizes gathered together. For the sample prepared at 180 °C, sheet-like structures appeared, and these sheet-like structures were relatively independent. Meanwhile, in the samples prepared at 200 °C, sheet-like structures also appeared, and these sheets were cross-connected to form flower-like structures. It can be considered that a higher temperature is beneficial to the formation of flower-like structures of CZTS. Fig. 1(d) shows the EDS diagram of CZTS prepared at 200 °C. It can be seen that CZTS was completely composed of Cu, Zn, Sn and S elements, and the distribution was uniform.

XRD and Raman analysis

Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD patterns of the CZTS samples prepared by the hydrothermal method. The main diffraction peaks of the samples prepared at 180 °C and 200 °C were consistent with the Kesterite structure CZTS standard card (JCPDS 26-0575).35 The characteristic diffraction peaks of crystal planes (112), (220) and (312) in the spectrum corresponded to diffraction angles of 28.52°, 47.35°, and 56.17°, respectively. Also, there were no impurity peaks, indicating that the prepared sample was pure CZTS. In comparison, the peak shapes for the sample prepared at 200 °C were sharper. Based on the XRD pattern, the lattice constants (a and c) could be calculated by the formula: (3)where hkl is the crystal plane index. The calculated lattice constants are a = 0.5427 nm and c = 1.0848 nm, which are very similar to the lattice constants of kesterite phase CZTS reported in the literature.36 With the diffraction pattern, the grain size could also be calculated by the Scherrer formula: (4)where K is a constant (0.89), λ is the wavelength of the X-ray (0.1540 nm), β is the half-width, and θ is the diffraction angle. The average grain sizes of CZTS prepared at 180 °C and 200 °C were about 2 nm and 2.5 nm, respectively. The sample prepared at 160 °C showed not only CZTS diffraction peaks, but also CuS diffraction peaks. This shows that the CZTS sample prepared at a lower temperature was impure, and increasing the reaction temperature potentially promotes the formation of pure CZTS. Because the XRD diffraction peaks of ZnS, Cu2SnS3 and CZTS are very similar, in order to further determine whether the prepared CZTS samples contained impurity phases, the Raman test results are presented in Fig. 2(b). The Raman vibration peak of CZTS at 331 cm−1 was found in all three samples, and the Raman peak of Cu2−xS also appeared in the Raman spectrum of the sample prepared at 160 °C, located near 475 cm−1.37,38 There were no other impurity peaks in the Raman spectrum; this confirms that the CZTS prepared at 180 °C and 200 °C were pure CZTS. The samples prepared at 160 °C included not only CZTS but also Cu2−xS, which was consistent with the XRD patterns.

XPS analysis
The chemical composition and electronic valence states of the CZTS prepared at 200 °C were analyzed by XPS, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. From the XPS full spectrum (Fig. 3a), it can be seen that CZTS contained four elements: Cu, Zn, Sn and S. Fig. 3(b–e) shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Cu 2p, Zn 2p, Sn 3d and S 2p. Fig. 3(b) shows that two characteristic Cu 2p peaks appeared at 951.4 eV (Cu 2p1/2) and 931.5 eV (Cu 2p3/2), respectively. The peak spacing was 19.9 eV, indicating that the valence state of Cu was +1. The electron binding energy peaks of Zn appeared at 1044.1 eV (Zn 2p1/2) and 1021.1 eV (Zn 2p3/2), and the peak spacing was 23 eV, indicating that the valence state of Zn was +2, as shown in Fig. 3(c). Fig. 3(d) shows two characteristic peaks related to Sn 3d, located at 495.6 eV (Sn 3d3/2) and 487.3 eV (Sn 3d5/2), respectively. The distance between the two peaks was 8.3 eV, indicating the existence of Sn4+. For the S 2p spectrum in Fig. 3(e), the binding energy revealed two S 2p peaks, which were at 162.6 eV (S 2p1/2) and 161.7 eV (S 2p3/2); this indicates that S exists in the form of −2 valence in the sulfide.39–41

DRS analysis
In order to study the optical properties of the CZTS nanomaterials prepared at different temperatures, DRS measurements were carried out. As shown in Fig. 4(a), all three samples had a strong, wide UV-visible absorption range. The Kubelka–Munk equation was used to estimate the band gaps of the CZTS nanomaterials. Fig. 4(b) shows the corresponding (αhν)2–hν curves. The band gaps of the samples were estimated by the intersections of the straight line and the abscissa in the extrapolation graphs. The band gaps of the CZTS nanomaterials prepared at 160 °C, 180 °C and 200 °C were 1.58, 1.52 and 1.50 eV, respectively. These were similar to the band gap widths of kesterite phase CZTS (1.4–1.6 eV) reported in the literature.42,43 In conjunction with Fig. 2, the CZTS sample prepared at 160 °C contained CuS; thus, its band gap was slightly larger. The CZTS prepared at 200 °C had a smaller band gap, which was closest to the suitable band gap range for photocatalytic applications.

Photoelectrochemical analysis
As is known, high efficiency photocatalysts must have good separation ability of photo-generated carriers. The separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers is related to the semiconductor properties of the photocatalyst itself, and the transmission rate of photogenerated carriers is related to the surface resistance of the photocatalyst.44,45 In order to test the separation and transportation of photogenerated carriers in CZTS at different temperatures, photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance tests were carried out on the three samples. The transient photocurrent responses of the CZTS nanomaterials prepared at different temperatures were tested, as shown in Fig. 5(a). All the samples had very sensitive response speeds. When the light was turned on, the photocurrents of all the CZTS samples increased instantly and then tended to be stable and reached the maximum value. The photocurrent dropped to the original state when the light was turned off. This is because when the light source was turned on and the CZTS nanomaterial was exposed to light, the separation of carriers occurred in the electronic structure. The positive and negative charges generated by the separation moved against each other under the action of an external electric field, generating a photocurrent. The photocurrent was proportional to the number of photogenerated carriers at a certain interval; until the light absorption was saturated, the photocurrent tended to be flat, and vice versa. The greater the photocurrent intensity, the better the photoelectric response effect of the nanomaterial and the better the carrier separation effect. The higher the photocurrent density, the higher the quantum yield. In addition, the i–t curve was repeatable in six lamp switching cycles, indicating that the sample had good stability. With increasing temperature, the reaction current increased gradually. The photocurrent density of CZTS prepared at 200 °C was relatively high, which indicates that the quantum yield of CZTS could be effectively improved by increasing the reaction temperature. The EIS test results of the different samples are shown in Fig. 5(b). The radius of the Nyquist diagram indicated the magnitude of impedance. The results showed that the Nyquist plot radius of the CZTS nanomaterial prepared at 200 °C was relatively small. This displayed that photo-generated electrons and holes could be separated effectively and that the interface electron transfer rate had increased.

Fig. 5(c) shows the Mott–Schottky (MS) diagrams of the CZTS nanomaterials obtained at different temperatures, which were used to analyze the space charge fields of the prepared samples. The straight lines of the graphs of the three samples all showed a negative slope, indicating that the three samples were p-type semiconductors. The flat band potential was estimated by extrapolating the straight line part of the spectrum, which could reflect the driving force of electron transfer at the interface between the semiconductor and solution.46 The flat band potentials of CZTS prepared at 160 °C, 180 °C and 200 °C were 0.28, 0.35 and 0.51 V vs. SCE, respectively, and the flat band potential shifted toward the positive direction. The increase of the reaction temperature would cause a positive shift of the flat band potential, which meant that the driving force for electron transfer between the semiconductor and the solution interface increased and the electron transfer rate at the semiconductor and electrolyte interface was accelerated, thereby driving the generation of more carriers. In addition, the positions of the valence band and conduction band of the semiconductors could be obtained from the flat band potential.47 For p-type semiconductors, the valence band position is 0.1 eV higher than the flat band potential. It could be calculated that the conduction band and valence band of CZTS prepared at 200 °C were −0.89 eV and 0.61 eV, respectively.
In order to study the ability of CZTS to decompose water, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was used to reveal the relationship between the current density and the potential relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). As shown in Fig. 6(a), the cathode current densities of the CZTS nanomaterials prepared at 160 °C, 180 °C and 200 °C were −4.084 mA cm−2, −6.001 mA cm−2 and −7.502 mA cm−2, respectively. The CZTS prepared at 200 °C had higher current density, stronger electrochemical activity, and high performance of electrocatalytic decomposition for hydrogen production. The LSV curve of the CZTS nanomaterials shown in Fig. 6(b) was linearly fitted by the Tafel equation η = a + blog(j); where there is an exchange current density, b is the Tafel slope, j is the current density, and η is the overpotential. The Tafel slope values of CZTS prepared at 160 °C, 180 °C and 200 °C were 199 mV dec−1, 197 mV dec−1 and 162 mV dec−1, respectively. The results showed that the higher the temperature, the better the catalytic activity of RHE. It can also be concluded that the prepared CZTS nanomaterials had a certain potential for hydrogen production by electrocatalytic decomposition.

Photocatalytic activity analysis
The photocatalytic degradation performance of different samples on RhB under visible light irradiation was studied. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the concentration of RhB solution without any photocatalyst did not change during the dark treatment. In the subsequent illumination process, the concentration hardly changed. In the first 60 minutes of the adsorption–desorption dark treatment process, the samples prepared at alternate temperatures had separate adsorption capacities for RhB.
With the increase of the preparation temperature, the amount of RhB adsorbed by the sample also increased, which may be related to the morphology of the material. CZTS samples with flower-like structures prepared at 200 °C may provide more photocatalytic adsorption sites. Therefore, more RhB could be adsorbed during the dark treatment process for subsequent light degradation. After calculation, the degradation efficiencies of RhB for the CZTS samples prepared at 160 °C, 180 °C, and 200 °C were 63.61%, 69.77%, and 98.20% within 90 min, respectively. In addition, it is worth noting that during the photocatalytic degradation process, the position of the maximum absorption peak in the RhB UV-vis spectrum underwent a blue shift with prolonged illumination time (see ESI,† Fig. S1). The main reason is that the RhB molecule undergoes an N-ethyl removal reaction during the photocatalytic degradation process, which leads to the change of the peak position of the maximum absorption peak.48Fig. 7(b) confirms the kinetic curves of the photocatalytic degradation of RhB by the various CZTS samples within 90 min. It can be seen that the degradation curves of the CZTS samples on RhB were consistent with the first-order apparent kinetic equation, which is (5)where k is the reaction rate constant (min−1) and t is the reaction time. The kinetic equation obtained by linear fitting showed that the degradation rate of the CZTS sample prepared at 200 °C was 0.02905 min−1 (see ESI,† Table S1). The CZTS sample prepared at 200 °C had a flower-like structure, and this structure may provide more photocatalytic active sites and produce more photogenerated electrons and holes, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance. Therefore, the photocatalytic efficiency and photocatalytic degradation rate of this sample were also significantly higher than those of the other samples.

Studies have shown that the degradation of some organic dyes is due to the degradation of the dye itself by injecting electrons into the semiconductor photocatalyst rather than the degradation of the dye caused by the light absorption of the semiconductor.49 In order to eliminate the possibility of dye sensitization, the photocatalytic degradation performance of the different samples for the colorless substance bisphenol A (BPA) under visible light irradiation was also studied (see ESI,† Fig. S2). The results (see ESI,† Fig. S3) showed that the degradation efficiencies of BPA for the CZTS samples prepared at 160 °C, 180 °C, and 200 °C were 22.45%, 23.96%, and 43.55% within 120 min, respectively. Moreover, the degradation rate of the CZTS sample prepared at 200 °C was 0.00377 min−1 (see ESI,† Table S2). Without the influence of dye sensitization, the prepared CZTS still has a certain photocatalytic activity.
In order to further prove that the CZTS prepared at 200 °C had photocatalytic activity, the total organic carbon in the photocatalytic solution system before and after photocatalysis was detected. The results (see ESI,† Table S3) showed that after 90 min of visible light irradiation, the total organic carbon (TOC) content decreased, and the TOC removal rate was 61.37%. The inorganic carbon content increased slightly, possibly because the RhB in the solution was mineralized into some inorganic substances. The total carbon content decreased, indicating that part of the carbon element may have escaped in the form of CO2. Therefore, it could be proved that the CZTS prepared at 200 °C had visible light catalytic activity. Its quantum efficiency (QE) could be estimated using the following formula: (6)where Rrp is the reaction rate of photons and Rap is the absorption rate of incident photons. The QE of CZTS prepared at 200 °C was estimated to be about 70.81%.
A cyclic degradation experiment was carried out on the 200 °C-CZTS photocatalyst, and the results are shown in Fig. 7(c). After five cycles of photocatalytic degradation of RhB, the degradation efficiency only decreased by 1.23%. There was almost no loss of photocatalytic activity, indicating that the sample had stable photocatalytic activity. Moreover, it was estimated that the turnover number of the photocatalyst was about 0.03 within 90 min; previous literature50 can be referred to for the details of this calculation. Fig. 7(d) shows the XRD patterns of CZTS prepared at 200 °C before and after photocatalysis. It can be seen that after 5 cycles of photocatalytic degradation of RhB, there was no crystal phase of the new substance in the sample; however, the peak intensity of CZTS was reduced.
The wavelength range of the monochromatic light source (600–800 nm) does not overlap with the dye spectrum but overlaps with the bandgap excitation of CZTS (1.5 eV). In the dark, after CZTS reached adsorption–desorption equilibrium at 30 minutes, the concentration of the RhB solution hardly changed. The photocatalytic activity of CZTS prepared at 200 °C under different wavelength ranges was investigated (see ESI,† Fig. S4). When using a 420 nm filter (420–800 nm) and a 600 nm filter (600–800 nm), the degradation efficiencies of RhB were 98.20% and 65.79%, respectively. Under the irradiation of a monochromatic light source, the CZTS prepared at 200 °C still had certain photocatalytic activity.
In order to clarify whether the reaction was carried out under light-enriched or light-limited conditions,51 the dependence of the photocatalytic activity of CZTS prepared at 200 °C on the irradiation power was explored (see ESI,† Fig. S5). In the dark, CZTS reached the adsorption–desorption equilibrium at 30 min and then stopped adsorbing RhB. Under the irradiation of light with powers of 150 W and 300 W, the degradation efficiencies of RhB were 98.20% and 98.60%, respectively. However, the degradation rate of RhB under 300 W light irradiation was 1.096 times that of RhB under 150 W light irradiation (see ESI,† Table S4). The results of the reaction under light-limited conditions showed that the degradation rate of RhB by CZTS prepared at 200 °C did not depend on the surface adsorption performance.
Studies have shown that h+, e− and ˙OH are the main active substances in the process of photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes.52 By introducing different sacrificial agents to capture the corresponding active substances, we explored which active substance played a major role in the photocatalytic degradation of RhB in the CZTS prepared at 200 °C. IPA, EDTA–2Na and AgNO3 were added to the photocatalytic system to capture ˙OH, h+ and e−, respectively. The corresponding degradation kinetic curves after adding different capture agents are shown in Fig. 8. By comparing the degradation efficiency, it could be seen that in the process of CZTS degradation of RhB, ˙OH played a major role, followed by e− and h+. Only when the position of the semiconductor valence band is lower than that of ˙OH/OH− (+1.99 eV vs. NHE) can the valence band holes react with H2O or OH− in the solution to generate ˙OH.53 Because the valence band position of CZTS was 0.61 eV, the possible mechanism of CZTS degradation of RhB can be summarized as follows: when light irradiated CZTS, electrons in the valence band of CZTS were excited to the conduction band, thereby leaving holes. Photo-generated electrons reacted with O2 and H2O in the solution to generate ˙OH. ˙OH interacted with RhB to generate H2O and CO2, thereby achieving the purpose of degradation.

Conclusion
In this paper, a flower-like structure of CZTS was successfully prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. XRD and Raman results indicated that the CZTS prepared at 200 °C was a pure phase of kesterite. The prepared CZTS was a p-type semiconductor, with a band gap of about 1.5 eV. The photocatalytic degradation of RhB was performed by CZTS under visible light. The degradation efficiency of RhB by CZTS reached 98.20% after 90 min of light irradiation, and the degradation rate was about 0.02905 min−1. After 5 degradation cycles, the degradation efficiency of CZTS photocatalysis only dropped by 1.23%; thus, it could still maintain high catalytic activity. Moreover, through free radical capture experiments, the mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation of RhB by CZTS was proposed in which e− could react with O2 and H2O in the solution to generate ˙OH, which interacted with RhB to generate H2O and CO2. After adding isopropanol, the degradation rate of RhB by CZTS decreased significantly, indicating that ˙OH was the main active substance in the photocatalytic degradation process. In addition, electrochemical tests showed that the prepared CZTS has potential applications in water splitting for hydrogen production.
