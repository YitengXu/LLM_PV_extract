    , Accepted 29th August 2012First published on 29th August 2012AbstractPoly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) nanofibers (PEDOT-NFs) with 10–50 nm diameters and high electrical conductivity (up to 83 S cm−1) have been fabricated chemically within micelles composed of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as nanoreactors. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 5 wt%) was added to a methanol-based colloidal dispersion containing PEDOT-NFs to improve dispersibility. The dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using PEDOT-NFs as a counter electrode (CE) with low surface resistance and a highly porous surface exhibited enhanced power conversion efficiency (9.2%) compared to bulk PEDOT (6.8%). To date, PEDOT-NFs have shown the highest performance among CEs using PEDOT. It also surpassed the efficiency of platinum (Pt) CEs (8.6%). Electrochemical characterization, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), showed that PEDOT-NFs efficiently reduced triiodide due to the enhanced electrical and morphological properties, which contributed to the high current density (17.5 mA cm−2) and fill factor (72.6%).
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising devices to supersede silicon-based solar cells1 due to their cost-effectiveness, simple fabrication processes, and powerful sunlight-harvesting efficiency.2,3 Thus, their commercialization has been accelerated, and several reports have been published to improve the performance of each constituent of DSSCs such as nanocrystalline TiO2,4–6 sensitizer dyes,7–9 electrolytes,10–12 and counter electrodes (CEs).13–15 Recently, the Grätzel group reported that porphyrin-sensitized solar cells with cobalt(II/III)-based redox electrolyte exceeded 12% efficiency.16 Among such constituents, the CE is one of the most important components of DSSCs and should have high conductivity and catalytic activity.13–15 The CE can affect series resistance (Rs) and charge-transfer resistance (Rct), which can increase photovoltaic parameters such as current density and fill factor, as well as overall power conversion efficiency.17–19 Until now, platinum (Pt) has been widely used as a CE because of its excellent conductivity and catalytic activity for the reduction of I3− ions. However, the risk of corrosion of expensive Pt materials and the fabrication of large-scale DSSCs should not be ignored in pursuit of inexpensive and stable DSSCs.15,20 Accordingly, the development of CEs with alternative materials has become increasingly important.
Recently, together with the carbonaceous materials,21–23 extensive studies have been performed using conducting polymers as CEs.24–31 In our lab, using spherical polypyrrole nanoparticles and Pt nanoparticles supported on polypyrrole nanospheres as CEs, we obtained high power conversion efficiencies (7.7% and 8.6%, respectively).25,26 Along with polypyrrole, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is commonly used as a CE due to its high conductivity, catalytic activity, and excellent environmental stability in air.32,33 For instance, PEDOT CEs using the electrochemical polymerization method24 and PEDOT nanotube CEs using the ZnO hard template method31 increased the overall conversion efficiency of DSSCs by approximately 8%. However, no studies have used PEDOT nanofibers (PEDOT-NFs) as CEs, despite the belief that one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures could be used for efficient charge transport.34,35
Here, we report that PEDOT-NF is a highly efficient CE that can be applied to DSSCs. The PEDOT-NF was prepared from cylindrical micelles formed by charge complexes between sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles and an FeCl3 initiator. As a result, the PEDOT-NF formed a porous network structure of CEs, which facilitated penetration of the electrolyte for redox reactions. Also, electron transfer occurred more readily from fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass to the electrolyte because the grain boundary and internal resistance of PEDOT-NFs were smaller than those of bulk PEDOT synthesized without SDS. Since PEDOT-NFs have excellent electrical conductivity and catalytic activity, they enhanced the performance of DSSCs. To the best of our knowledge, the power conversion efficiency of 9.2% is the highest efficiency achieved using only PEDOT as the CE.
Experimental
Synthesis of the PEDOT-NF
A typical synthesis proceeded as follows, as described previously.36 The PEDOT-NF was synthesized using chemical oxidative polymerization within a cylindrical micellar template. SDS (30 mmol) was dissolved in distilled water (100 mL), and an aqueous solution of FeCl3 (16.33 mmol) was added to the solution with stirring for 1 h at 50 °C. Then, EDOT monomer (1 g, 7 mmol) was slowly added to the solution, and the polymerization reaction proceeded for 6 h at 50 °C. After polymerization, the resulting PEDOT-NF was filtered and washed with methanol and distilled water several times for purification and then immediately re-dispersed in methanol with ultrasonication. To compare properties of the PEDOT-NF to those of bulk PEDOT, a bulk EDOT polymerization was performed under the same conditions without using SDS. In this case, polymerization was performed for 24 h to obtain a small amount of PEDOT due to the very low yield. The polymerization yield of the PEDOT-NF was as high as 40%.
Preparation of PEDOT-NF CEs and DSSCs
The PEDOT-NF (2 wt%) re-dispersed in methanol was ultrasonicated with an Ultrasonic Processor GEX-500 probe sonicator for 3 min to form stable dispersions. To improve the dispersibility of the PEDOT-NF, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 5 wt%) was added to the resulting dispersion. PEDOT-NF CEs were produced by spin-coating on an FTO glass substrate (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 Ω sq−1, 2.3 mm thick) at 2000 RPM for 40 seconds. Finally, the CEs were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 2 h. For comparison, a conventional Pt CE was prepared by coating a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (2 mg of Pt in 1 mL of ethanol) onto an FTO glass substrate and heating at 400 °C for 15 min.
Photoanodes were prepared as described previously.25,26 Next, the photoanodes were immersed in N719 dye (Solaronix) solution (0.3 mM in CH3CN) and kept at room temperature for 12 h. The dye-adsorbed photoanodes and various CEs were assembled in a sealed sandwich-type cell with a 50 μm gap of a hot-melt ionomer film (Surlyn, DuPont). Then, the electrolytes were introduced into the cell, which consisted of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN), and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile.
Characterization
The morphology of the synthesized PEDOT was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM 2100F). The electrical conductivity of the PEDOT was measured using a four-point probe technique (Advanced Instrument Technology, CMT-100M). Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements were performed using a Rigaku X-ray generator (Rigaku, D/MAX-2500) with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) radiation operated at 40 kV and 60 mA. Atomic force microscopy (AFM; PSIA XE-100) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S4800) were used to analyze the structures and surface properties of the PEDOT layers of the CEs. Cyclic voltammetry (CV; Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat) was measured in a three-electrode system with Pt/FTO and PEDOT/FTO working electrodes, a Pt wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode dipped in an acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 in the range ±1.0 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of solar cells were measured under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 using a 450 W xenon arc lamp (Ushio, UXL-75XE). The AM 1.5 Oriel solar simulator was calibrated using KG5 filtered Si reference solar cells (National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) certified Si diode, area = 3.937 cm2) to reduce mismatch in the 350–750 nm region between the simulated light and AM 1.5 to less than 2%. Prior to the measurements, light-shading masks were used on the DSSCs to reduce scattered light from the edge of the glass electrodes of the TiO2 layer, so the average active area of a DSSC was 0.18 cm2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using an impedance analyzer (Parstat 2273, Princeton) at zero bias potential and 10 mV of amplitude over the frequency range 0.1–100 kHz at 20 °C.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the preparation of PEDOT-NFs by microemulsion polymerization. First, SDS as anionic surfactant and FeCl3 as an oxidant produced micelles with a cylindrical structure. These micelles formed due to complexation between anionic surfactant and iron cations due to the increase in ionic strength and electrostatic attraction.36–38 Once the EDOT monomer was in solution, it diffused inside the micelles because of its hydrophobic properties, and the EDOT monomer oxidized by iron cations began to polymerize (Fig. 1a). The polymerized PEDOT was then doped with dodecyl sulfate anions by further oxidation (Fig. 1b) and was stable due to the counter ions. During the overall reaction, the color of the reaction solution changed from milky yellow to green and finally to dark blue. The PEDOT-NF showed higher structural order and electrical conductivity than the bulk PEDOT synthesized without SDS due to the strong π-stacking structure. Also, the long alkyl chain of the dopant ion increased the dispersibility in various organic solvents. This micelle polymerization technique also allowed us to produce large quantities of PEDOT and to easily manufacture low-cost CEs.

Typical TEM images at different magnifications of the PEDOT-NF with diameters of 10–50 nm are shown in Fig. 2a and b. The diameter of the PEDOT-NF can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of oxidant and surfactant and modulating the temperature. The PEDOT-NF has a very small diameter and a high aspect ratio (>100), allowing these nanofibers to interconnect at a cross-linking point. Also, the 1D structure of the PEDOT-NF had a smaller grain boundary than bulk PEDOT (Fig. 2c), resulting in relatively good electron transfer.35 Consequently, the electrical conductivity of a pressed pellet of the PEDOT-NF was as high as 83 S cm−1, while that of bulk PEDOT was 0.5 S cm−1.

WAXD patterns of the PEDOT-NF and bulk PEDOT are shown in Fig. 3. The WAXD pattern of the PEDOT-NF exhibited diffraction peaks at 2θ = 6.4° (d = 13.8 Å), 12.7° (d = 6.9 Å), and 25.9° (d = 3.4 Å), corresponding to the (1 0 0), (2 0 0), and (0 2 0) planes of the PEDOT backbone.38,39 The diffraction peak at 2θ = 6.4° represented the layer structure of the PEDOT main chain, which was related to the doping level.40,41 The intensity of the (1 0 0) peak was higher for the PEDOT-NF than for the bulk PEDOT, suggesting that the PEDOT-NF was in a well-doped state and had better structural order than the bulk PEDOT. Likewise, the difference in intensity for the (2 0 0) peak was explained by the same reason. The diffraction peak at 2θ = 25.9° for both samples corresponded to the interchain planar ring-stacking distance. Although the diffraction patterns of the two samples were similar, the peak at 2θ = 25.9° of the PEDOT-NF showed higher intensity and a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) than bulk PEDOT. These results indicated that dodecyl sulfate anions increased the structural order of the PEDOT chains, as well as the strength of the molecular interaction between the stacked rings. These results are consistent with the electrical conductivity results.

Fig. 4 shows the SEM and AFM images of both CEs. Each of the CEs was prepared using PEDOT-NF dispersion within methanol and methanol with 5 wt% DMSO (PNF and PNFD, respectively). Although SEM images (Fig. 4a and b) appeared similar, AFM images (Fig. 4c and d) showed clear differences in surface topography between the two samples. The surface roughness value of PNF (∼90.5 nm) was higher than that of PNFD (∼69.9 nm). However, the PNFD sample appeared more homogeneous and uniform than the PNF, which contributed to the complete coverage of the FTO glass by the PEDOT-NF. The increased performance of the PNFD sample may be ascribed to a reduction in problems associated with the direct exposure of FTO glass to the electrolyte.13 Line profiles under the AFM images show more rough surfaces for the PNFD than the PNF within a certain range (−100 to 100 nm). As a result, the porous and rough network structure facilitated the penetration of electrolytes for redox reactions. DMSO contributed to stabilizing the colloids containing the positively charged PEDOT backbone because the solvent molecules were extremely polar with a high dipole moment (3.96 D). The ability to form stable PEDOT colloids allows for simple production of this conducting polymer for practical applications.42 Also, previous studies reported that the screening effect by polar solvents such as DMSO decreased the electrical attraction between positively charged PEDOT and negatively charged dopant ions.43 Therefore, DMSO enhanced the hopping rate and electrical conductivity in the PEDOT systems, which is in agreement with the surface resistance values of PNF and PNFD in Table 1.

To explore the reaction kinetics of the I−/I3− redox couple, CV was performed with an electrochemical system of different CEs. Fig. 5 compared the cyclic voltammograms obtained from the Pt, PNF, and PNFD for the I−/I3− redox system. For the Pt electrode, two typical pairs of oxidation/reduction peaks were clearly observed, while for both PEDOT electrodes, a third pair of redox peaks was also observed; this pair was likely caused by the doping/dedoping process of dopant anions such as dodecyl sulfate in PEDOT.44 At the Pt electrode, the relatively negative peak was assigned to the reduction reaction (1), while the positive peak was assigned to the reduction reaction (2).45,46 I3− + 2e− = 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− = 2I3−(2)
 Fig. 5  Cyclic voltammograms for Pt, PNF, and PNFD electrodes in 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The peak potential separation (Epp) is given in the inset. 
However, we explored characteristics of the first pair of redox peaks because the performance of CEs was influenced mainly by catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I− (eqn (1)).47,48 The standard electrochemical rate constant of the oxidation/reduction reaction was negatively correlated with the peak potential separation (Epp).26 The Epp value of the PNFD (0.44 V) was lower than that of the PNF (0.49 V) because the oxidation peak shifted slightly toward the negative potential, suggesting that the electrocatalytic activity toward the I−/I3− redox reaction was greater for PNFD than PNF. Also, compared to the Pt electrode, the PNFD showed higher redox current density, likely due to the large catalytic active site toward the reduction of I2 and I3− ions. These results coincide with the reduced charge-transfer resistance (Rct) obtained from the EIS measurements and DSSCs with higher efficiencies.

Fig. 6 shows the current–potential (J–V) curves obtained for sets of cells assembled with different CEs. The photovoltaic parameters, such as the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (ff), and overall conversion efficiency (η) determined from these curves, are shown in Table 1. Compared to the cell based on bulk PEDOT, two cells based on PEDOT-NFs had relatively higher Voc and ff values because of the low surface resistance, over-potential, and good adhesion to FTO glass.15 Among the parameters of the two cells using PEDOT-NFs, the Jsc value of the PNFD cell was much higher than that of the PNF cell, while the Voc and ff values were similar. Although the η of the cell based on PNF peaked at ∼8.3%, the cell based on PNFD gave Jsc = 17.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 724 mV, and ff = 72.6%, corresponding to η = 9.2%. The high Jsc value was due to the efficient redox reaction in the I−/I3− system, as discussed in the CV analysis, and the homogeneous and uniform surface of CEs, as seen in Fig. 4. Due to the low surface resistance, good adhesion, efficient redox reaction, and homogeneous and uniform surface, it was possible to achieve an overall conversion efficiency of PNFD-based DSSCs similar to that of Pt-based DSSCs (8.6%). Importantly, the performance of the PNFD-based DSSCs was superior to that of Pt-based DSSCs.

J–V curves of the DSSCs using various CEs. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. 
EIS analysis has been widely used to explore the reduction of I3− ions on CEs, and a well-supported equivalent circuit is a powerful tool to study CEs during DSSC operation. Fig. 7 shows Nyquist plots (the higher-frequency region is enlarged for clarity) and the equivalent circuit for the electrochemical cells based on various CE materials. In the high-frequency region, the ohmic serial resistance (Rs) (mainly associated with the FTO glass) can be determined based on the onset of the first semicircle (∼100 kHz). The Rs values of both cells prepared from the PEDOT-NF were analogous to that of the Pt cell due to low surface resistance, but that of bulk PEDOT was slightly increased with high surface resistance. Charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and the double layer capacitance (Cdl) of the electrode appeared in the first semicircle. The charge-transfer resistance (Rct) values of the electrochemical cells were obtained from the diameters of the semicircles. The Rct value of PNFD was slightly smaller than Pt, suggesting that PNFD exhibits higher exchange current density than Pt according to the equation J0 = RT/nFRct, in which R, T, and F are the gas constant, temperature, and Faraday constant, respectively.13,15 Therefore, the faster reduction rate of I3− ions caused by the increased electrocatalytic activity increased Jsc for the PNFD-based DSSCs due to the decreased Rct. Also, Bisquert et al. argued that total series resistance (Rseries) affects the cell fill factor, according to the sum of several contributions; namely, Rseries = Rs + Rct + Rd.17,18,31 Because Pt, PNF, and PNFD had similar Rseries values, we obtained similar ff values.

Conclusions
In summary, PEDOT-NFs with uniform sizes (10–50 nm) were successfully synthesized through the chemical oxidative polymerization of EDOT within micelles as nanoreactors. The CEs for DSSCs based on PEDOT-NFs were fabricated by spin-coating onto FTO glass. By preparing a highly dispersible PEDOT-NF with DMSO treatment, the overall conversion efficiency of the DSSCs reached a maximum of ∼9.20%, which has been the highest efficiency to date using only PEDOT as the CEs, and had better performance than Pt CEs. This achievement can be obtained using PEDOT-NFs with highly enhanced catalytic properties and electrical conductivity. Optimization of the photovoltaic parameters by controlling the electrical conductivity, fiber diameter, PEDOT layer thickness, and electrolyte composition can further enhance DSSC performance. This study can be used to design efficient CEs using conducting polymers to outperform Pt CEs.
