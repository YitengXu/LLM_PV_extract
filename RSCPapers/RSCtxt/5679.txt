    , Accepted 9th July 2015First published on 10th July 2015AbstractIn response to the ever-increasing demand for grid-scale energy storage systems, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) working at ambient- or room-temperature are gaining much attention as promising alternatives because of the abundance and low cost of sodium resources. However, their adoption is significantly hampered by several issues, especially in terms of sluggish kinetics and capacity retention during cycling. Herein, flexible Prussian blue analogue FeFe(CN)6/carbon cloth composites are synthesized using low temperature strategies and utilized as a potential host for sodium ion insertion. As a proof of concept, the composites demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance: a reversible specific capacity of 82 mA h g−1 at 0.2C, good rate capability and long term cycling life with 81.2% capacity retention over 1000 cycles. Most significantly, this low-cost, scalable and low-temperature synthesis provides guidance for the design of other flexible materials that could have applications in wearable electronics, energy storage and conversion devices.
Introduction
Advanced energy storage technologies are urgently needed to meet the continuously surging demands of emerging applications including electric vehicles and grid-level energy storage for intermittent power sources produced from wind and solar energy.1–3 Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have enjoyed great success in portable electronics over the past two decades, and currently being intensively pursued for transportation due to their reasonable durability, small spatial footprints, and superior power and energy densities.4,5 Nevertheless, the main barrier is the high cost and partly safety considerations. Currently, LIBs manufactured for consumer electronics cost several hundred dollars per stored energy (kW h). But for vehicle applications, the cost must come down closer to USD 100/kW h, and it should be cheaper still for grid applications. The expensive lithium resources and accessible global lithium reserves greatly lead to controversies in the mass production of energy storage devices. The exploration for alternative new battery concepts beyond LIBs using naturally abundant materials has thus attracted increasing attention.6,7
Ambient temperature sodium-ion batteries are one of the promising candidates in this regard due to the worldwide abundance and low cost of sodium resources, also better safety compared to high-temperature Na/S and Na/NiCl2 Zebra cells.8–11 Similar to Li-ion batteries, SIBs operate following a “rock chair” concept, in which Na+ deintercalates from one electrode, diffusing through the electrolyte, and then inserts into the other electrode material. Additionally, electrolytes with lower decomposition potential can be used and electrolyte degradation will be reduced in Na-ion batteries owing to the lower standard potential of sodium (E0 = −2.71 V vs. SHE) compared with lithium (−3.04 V vs. SHE). In particular, the ability to use an aluminum current collector for the anode must be effective for further cost reduction in battery manufacture.12 Despite these distinct advantages, the practical application of Na-ion batteries is hindered by several issues, including a much larger radius of Na+ (1.02 Å, ∼55% larger than Li+ of 0.76 Å), and is three times heavier than lithium (23 g mol−1 compared with 6.9 g mol−1), which leads to sluggish kinetics of Na+ transport and insertion/deinsertion in the electrochemical process. Therefore, considerable improvements have been continuously made in the design and preparation of novel electrodes with enhanced electrochemical performances for advanced Na-ion technologies.
To date, various potential sodium intercalation cathode materials and new electrolytes have been extensively investigated for applications in SIBs.13–15 Layered Na transition metal oxides, such as P2-Nax[Fe1/2Mn1/2]O2], are potential candidates for high capacity positive electrodes, which could deliver a reversible capacity of 190 mA h g−1 with the Fe3+/Fe4+ redox couple.16 The energy density of P2-type Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 achieves 540 W h kg−1 in a half-cell based on a sodium metal anode, but both of them suffer from insufficient cyclability and poor kinetics.17 Triphylite-type NaFePO4 shows great thermal stability (up to 480 °C) and a promising theoretical capacity of 154 mA h g−1.18 Nevertheless, larger unit cell volume expansion was observed, and the materials are usually obtained by the ion-exchange reaction of LiFePO4. NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 and its fluorophosphates exhibit superior rate capability and excellent cycling performance.19,20 Around 50% of the initial capacity was obtained over 30000 cycles at 40C (4.7 A g−1) reported by Balaya's group21 as well as the ultrafast Na-storage in carbon-coated nanosized Na3V2(PO4)3 embedded in a porous carbon matrix, delivering a specific capacity of 44 mA h g−1 at a current density up to 200C.22 Compared with that obtained in the Li-ion electrode, the reversible specific capacity of bulk sodium ion intercalation is usually limited to approximately 120 mA h g−1. Thus, it is of both academic and practical significance in the SIB field to discover and tailor new cathode materials to achieve high Na-storage capacity and long term stability.
Owing to their unique structural features, coordination polymers (CPs), including metal–organic frameworks (MOFs, an emerging class of materials made from metal ions and organic ligands),23 and porous coordination polymers (PCPs)24 have attracted intense research interest because of their numerous promising applications in the fields of gas storage,25 catalysis,26 magnetism,27,28 luminescence,29 and sensing applications.30,31 Recently, their unique combination of optical and electronic properties has led to interest in incorporating them into photovoltaic and electrochemical devices.32,33 Vittal et al.34,35 firstly investigated the electrochemical performance of metal–organic-phosphate open frameworks as a new class of cathode materials for lithium ion batteries, and the utilization of the oxalatophosphate framework as a single source precursor for the synthesis of inorganic materials.36 Among the reported MOFs, Prussian blue and its analogues (PBAs) have recently been explored for various applications ranging from separation, catalysis, molecular magnetics and energy storage. Our group recently reported promising utilization of PBAs as new precursors for nanoporous inorganic material preparation in LIBs.37 A bi-functional device for a self-powered electrochromic window and transparent battery by using Prussian blue as an electrode has been demonstrated by Lou and co-workers.38 Wessells et al.39,40 demonstrated reversible insertion/extraction of sodium and potassium ions in nickel/copper hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles with superior rate capabilities and extremely long cycling stability when operated in inexpensive aqueous electrolytes. Full open-framework aqueous batteries were reported by combining the copper hexacyanoferrate cathode with an activated carbon/polypyrrole composite anode,41 also a newly developed manganese hexacyanomanganate open-framework anode.42 All the battery systems exhibited high efficiency and excellent capacity retention for ultralong cycles, which make PBAs desirable for stationary energy storage application. Moreover, the electrochemical Na+/Li+ intercalation into PBAs have been investigated in organic electrolytes.43,44 Very recently, Prussian blue analogues have also been demonstrated as potential hosts for various di-/tri-valent charge carrier ions, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+ and Al3+ in aqueous electrolytes.45–48 Prussian blue analogues have a general formula of AxP[R(CN)6]y·□1−y·nH2O, A: alkali cations; P, R: transition metal; and □: [R(CN)6] vacancy, where transition metal ions are bridged to cyanide ligands forming a cubic face-centered structure (Scheme 1). Large interstitial ‘A sites’ within the structure can host zeolitic water, hydrated alkali and di-/tri-valent ions.49 In the open-framework, guest cations can occupy large interstitial ‘A sites’ around the center of each cube sub-cell, and the large channels oriented in the 〈100〉 directions allow rapid transport of these ions throughout the lattice, thus enabling the insertion and rapid diffusion of a wide variety of ions, and small molecules with very little lattice strain.45,50

The concerns about the Prussian blue analogues are their insufficient cycle life and low energy efficiency in non-aqueous electrolytes for sodium-ion batteries, associated with the low electrical conductivity and structural imperfection.51,52 In this work, we report a significant advance in the design and preparation of Prussian blue analogue FeFe(CN)6·xH2O (ref. 53) nanoparticles on a flexible carbon fiber paper as a binder-free cathode in both organic and aqueous electrolytes. This electrode structure design with a high conductive scaffold for loading electroactive materials effectively prevents the loss of active mass and enhances electrical contact, which make it an ideal candidate for use in SIBs. The configuration can also significantly simplify the battery packing process. To the best of our knowledge, the environmentally friendly and good economy candidate grown on flexible conductive substrates has not been studied yet. The Na-ion insertion/extraction mechanism and significantly improved sodium storage were examined by ex situ57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. With the merits of carbon cloth paper such as flexible structure and high conductivity, the resulting FeFe(CN)6·xH2O nanocomposite electrode exhibits a reversible specific capacity of 82 mA h g−1 at 0.2C, prolonged cycling performance with 81.2% capacity retention for 1000 cycles, and good high rate response up to 10C.
Results and discussion
Carbonfiber paper with high flexibility and conductivity was used as the growth substrate for the FeFe(CN)6 Prussian blue analogues. The fabrication of the FeFe(CN)6/carbonfiber composites were realized simply by a solution precipitation route at an elevated temperature of 60 °C (see Fig. 1). Firstly, concentrated nitric acid was chosen to activate the surface of carbonfiber paper to increase the binding sites and adhesion between carbonfiber paper and FeFe(CN)6 nanoparticles.54 Subsequently, FeFe(CN)6 nanoparticles were directly grown on the conductive carbonfiber paper substrates by a facile solution precipitation method. After the synthesis, the color of the carbonfiber paper changed from black to dark green, suggesting that FeFe(CN)6 nanoparticles have grown successfully. Importantly, the resulting film exhibits good flexibility and mechanical properties under bending with tweezers, which can be directly used as a free-standing electrode for sodium ion batteries (Fig. S1†).
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the process used for the synthesis of FeFe(CN)6/carbon cloth composites. 
The morphology of the products was examined with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The low SEM image (Fig. 2a) of FeFe(CN)6/carbon cloth composites displays an overview of the three-dimensional texture structure, where the woven carbon cloth consisting of many carbon fibers serves as an excellent conductive scaffold for uniform growth of the FeFe(CN)6 nanoparticles. The carbon fibers keep the ordered woven structure of the carbon cloth after the crystal growth of FeFe(CN)6, but exhibit a rougher surface as compared to that of the pure carbon cloth (Fig. 2b and c, Fig. S2†), indicating that the carbon cloth has been covered with the FeFe(CN)6 product. The magnified FESEM images in Fig. 2d reveal that the FeFe(CN)6 nanoparticles uniformly cover the carbonfiber paper and they interconnect with each other to form an integrated structure. Fig. 2e displays the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) of FeFe(CN)6/carbon cloth composites, which confirm the formation of pure FeFe(CN)6 and uniform distribution of iron, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen components throughout the composite. To gain further information on the microstructure of the composites, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement was carried out. As shown in Fig. S3,† the size of FeFe(CN)6 nanoparticles is estimated to be approximately 200 nm, consistent with the SEM results. Furthermore, the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. S3b†) clearly demonstrated the single crystalline nature of the nanoparticles. In comparison, only agglomerations of FeFe(CN)6 nanoparticles with the size of 200–400 nm will be formed under similar synthesis conditions in the absence of carbon cloth substrates (Fig. S4†).

The crystallographic structure of the samples was further analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 3a shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared FeFe(CN)6/carbon textiles and bare FeFe(CN)6 nanoparticles. All the diffraction peaks can be readily indexed to a face-centered cubic structure (space group Fmm), in good accordance with the results reported in the literature.51,55 Additional reflections at around 26.2° and 43.1° highlighted by an asterisk in the FeFe(CN)6/carbon textile composite originate from the carbon cloth (Fig. S5†).56,57 Toward smaller crystallite size, reflections from FeFe(CN)6/carbon textiles are significantly broad and their intensity decreases.58 FeIII[FeIII(CN)6]·yH2O is a typical Prussian blue analogue. The structure of ferriferricyanide contains a three-dimensional network of Fe1–NC–Fe2 chains along the edges of the unit cell cube, where octahedral FeIII(CN)63− complexes are bridged into a simple cubic lattice by Fe3+ ions, forming a face-centred cubic phase (Scheme 1). The band at 2084.8 cm−1 and a broad peak at 3365.8 cm−1 were assigned to the stretching vibrations from CN− and the v(O–H) of water molecules, respectively, as evidenced by the FTIR spectrum (Fig. 3b). The composition of FeFe(CN)6 was further confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The initial 15.8% weight loss below 180 °C can be attributed to the removal of weakly bonded and coordinated water molecules in the PBAs, corresponding to the loss of 2 water molecules from the structure, indicating that hydrated FeFe(CN)6·2H2O is obtained under the current conditions (Fig. S6†). The water content is well consistent with the results of Prussian blue and its analogue electrodes for rechargeable batteries reported in recent ref. 51, 59 and 60, where the corresponding contents of water of nickel ferricyanide, FeFe(CN)6 nanoparticles and Na1.40MnFe(CN)6 are about 34%, 20%, and 17%, respectively. The second weight loss of 30.5% observed between 175 and 275 °C is caused by the decomposition and subsequent oxidation of the metal–organic frameworks.

To study the electrochemical properties of the FeFe(CN)6/carbon textile binder-free electrode, coin cells were fabricated with sodium foil as a counter electrode. Fig. 4a exhibits the initial five charge/discharge profiles of FeFe(CN)6/carbon textiles at a current density of 0.2C (1C = 120 mA g−1), in which two distinguishable charge potential plateaus at around 3.1 V and 3.6 V, and a discharge potential plateau (2.8 and 3.4 V) appear, consistent with results noted in previous reports and the CV analysis discussed below (Fig. 7).43,51 The electrode delivered high first-cycle charge and discharge capacities of 83 and 82 mA h g−1, respectively, corresponding to an initial coulombic efficiency of about 98.7%. From the second cycle, the reversible capacity is stable and maintained at around 81 mA h g−1, implying the outstanding reversibility and stability of the electrodes. It is noteworthy that the carbon textile substrate in the composites is electrochemically inactive in the voltage window selected, thus it does not contribute to the observed specific capacity (Fig. S7†). Fig. 4c shows the cycling performance of the FeFe(CN)6/carbon textile at a higher current density of 0.5 and 1C (after initial ten cycles at 0.2C). It clearly reveals that the as-prepared material demonstrated a good cycle life over 1200 charge/discharge cycles. An initial capacity of 72 mA h g−1 was achieved at a current rate of 0.5C. The capacity decreased to 54 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles, which represents a capacity fade of 25%. When the current density was increased to 1.0C, improved cycle stability was achieved. The cells retained 81.2% of the initial capacity at the end of the long-term 1000 cycles at 1C, corresponding to an average capacity decay of 0.019% per cycle. Simultaneously, it also exhibited a high and stable coulombic efficiency of above 99% after the initial cycles.

Rate capability is another important parameter for evaluating the power applications of sodium ion batteries. To manifest the high-rate performance, the discharge capacities were investigated at different C-rates in the potential range of 2.0 to 4.0 V. As shown in Fig. 4b, the composites deliver very high capacities of 83, 77, 72, 69 and 62 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5C, respectively. Importantly, the capacity was recovered when the current was reduced to initial 0.2C after 70 cycles, indicating high reversibility of the electrode. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed on fresh cells with an amplitude of 5 mV in frequencies from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz (Fig. S8†). Both Nyquist plots comprise two parts including a depressed semicircle at high frequency and a linear Warburg part at a low frequency. Obviously, the FeFe(CN)6/carbon textile electrodes show a smaller diameter of semicircles in the Nyquist plots than those of the corresponding bare FeFe(CN)6 electrodes, thus indicating a lower charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and better kinetics for Na+ insertion/extraction reactions. After 10 cycles at 0.2C, the FeFe(CN)6/carbon cloth electrode has a slightly larger impedance (Fig. S8†), which may be due to the formation of the surface electrolyte interface (SEI) during the cycles, further confirming that the carbon cloth could indeed act as a good substrate for FeFe(CN)6 loading. This improved Na+ storage properties can be attributed to the high electronic conductivity of the carbon textile and the nanoparticle morphology, which facilitate short and fast transport for both electrons and Na+.
The morphology change of an FeFe(CN)6/carbon textile composite after cycling at different current densities from 0.2 to 10C for 60 cycles is shown in Fig. 5. Compared with the original samples (Fig. 2c and d), the morphology of electrodes becomes rough as the result of the redox reaction. However, it maintains the particle-like morphology, where the FeFe(CN)6 active materials are still connected with the carbon textiles, effectively preventing the pulverization and aggregation of nanoparticles during cycling. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the FeFe(CN)6/carbon cloth after 50 cycles further demonstrates the structural stability of the FeFe(CN)6/carbon textiles electrode (Fig. S9†). The sodium ion and electron can migrate back and forth facilely and rapidly from the active material to the current collector due to the intimate contact between the electroactive material and the conductive carbon fiber cloth, beneficial for high-rate capability and excellent cyclic stability.61,62

Aqueous rechargeable sodium ion batteries, which offer some compelling merits in terms of safety, low cost, and scalability, have been regarded as promising alternatives for large-scale energy storage applications.63 Moreover, higher ionic motilities are observed in aqueous electrolytes and thus compensate relatively sluggish kinetics, resulting in high roundtrip efficiency.64 The electrochemical Na storage of the FeFe(CN)6 electrode was investigated by both cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles in mildly acidic 1 M NaNO3 (pH = 2) aqueous solution owing to the stability of PBAs at acidic pH than at neutral and basic one.40,42 As shown in Fig. S10a,† a pair of very symmetric redox peaks located at 0.01 and 0.18 V were clearly observed in the voltage window of −0.4–0.6 V with respect to a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), which can be attributed to the reversible insertion/extraction of sodium ions into the PBA crystal lattice. FeFe(CN)6 was also evaluated by charge–discharge measurements under different current densities ranging from 0.05 A g−1 to 2 A g−1 (Fig. S10b†). The FeFe(CN)6 electrode delivers discharge capacities of 53, 24, 10, and 4 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 A g−1, respectively. However, fast capacity fade was observed with increasing current densities, probably due to the electrode connecting wire corrosion in acidic solution and fast cation migration gradually destroying the crystal structure of the FeFe(CN)6 Prussian blue analogue.65
Mössbauer spectroscopy was recorded to accurately probe the detailed compositions and local structures of iron in the obtained samples.66,67 The black dots and red solid lines correspond to the experimental data and fitted results, respectively (Fig. 6). The Mössbauer spectrum of the pristine FeFe(CN)6 collected at room temperature consists of one singlet and one doublet sub-spectrum, demonstrating the existence of two distinct Fe(III) sites, typical of FeFe(CN)6 Prussian blue analogues.55,68 The reaction mechanism was further verified by ex situ Mössbauer spectra of FeFe(CN)6 at different states during electrochemical Na+ intercalation/de intercalation (Fig. S11†). Fig. 7 shows the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the FeFe(CN)6/carbon textile composite electrode in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Two pairs of well-defined redox peaks at 3.53/3.36 V and 2.98/2.80 V can be observed, similar to the CV responses of Prussian blue analogues in literature reports.43,51,68–70 Additionally, the CV curves exhibit good reproducibility and similar shapes with increasing cycle number, demonstrating high reversibility and stability during the sodium insertion and extraction. Based on the different coordination sites of the Fe ions as well as previous electrochemical investigation on Prussian blue analogues, we therefore conclude that the peaks at 2.98/2.80 V correspond to oxidation/reduction of the FeIII/FeII couple bonding to the N atoms of CN− and those at 3.53/3.36 V to the FeIII/FeII couple coordinated with CN− by C atoms, respectively.43,51 The redox behaviour occurring in the ferriferricyanide could be described as the electrochemical reaction of eqn (1) and (2): FeIIIFeIII(CN)6 + Na+ + e− → NaFeIIIFeII(CN)6(1) NaFeIIIFeII(CN)6 + Na+ + e− → Na2FeIIFeII(CN)6(2)

 Fig. 7  CV curves measured in the voltage of 2.0–4.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. 
The reason for the different electrochemical activities of the two Fe atoms in FeIIIFeIII(CN)6, especially the voltages and intensities of the reduction and oxidation peaks, has not been fully elucidated despite them exhibiting the same oxidization state. Ongoing experiments with in situ XRD measurement, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and neutron diffraction etc. during electrochemical charge–discharge will provide a more complete understanding of the Na+ insertion reaction in this open framework.44,45
Conclusions
To conclude, we have synthesized flexible FeFe(CN)6/carbon cloth nanocomposites by using a simple solution precipitation method. As a proof of concept, the hybrid demonstrated a specific capacity of 82 mA h g−1 at 0.2C rate, good rate capability and cycling performance with 81.2% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. The excellent performance of the FeFe(CN)6/carbon textile composite benefits from its electrode architectures. Firstly, the FeFe(CN)6 nanoparticles grown directly on the conductive carbon cloth form an integrated electrode, which ensure intimate contact and fast electron transport between the carbon cloth current collector and the electroactive materials. Secondly, open spaces and loose textures between neighboring carbon fibers provide more efficient penetration of the electrolyte into the FeFe(CN)6 nanoparticles and accommodation of the strain induced by the volume change during cycles. Thirdly, the nano-sizes of FeFe(CN)6 active materials provide relatively short Na+ and e− diffusion paths. Lastly, the binder-free electrodes, avoiding the use of binders or any conducting additives enable a low internal resistance and favorable charge-transfer kinetics. Furthermore, the facile and simple low temperature route used to obtain these environmentally benign positive materials with smaller sizes not only tends to simplify large-scale commercialization but opens new perspectives to develop other flexible Prussian blue and its analogues. These encouraging findings can provide a new insight into the possibility of hierarchical FeFe(CN)6/carbon cloth composites as high-performance flexible sodium ion battery electrodes for large-scale applications in stretchable and bendable energy devices in the near future.
Experimental
Materials synthesis
Commercially available carbon textiles were firstly treated in 65–68% nitric acid reflux at 80 °C for 8 h, then cleaned by deionized water and ethanol for several times, respectively. Typically, 10 mL of 0.1 M K3Fe(CN)6 solution was added to the same concentration of 20 mL FeCl3 solution during a period of 5 min under agitation at room temperature, followed by the addition of a piece of acid-treated carbon cloth rectangular in shape, and then the resulting solution was maintained at 60 °C for 6 h. After cooling down to room temperature naturally, the carbon textiles covered with the dark-green product were picked up with tweezers, thoroughly rinsed several times with deionized water and acetone, and dried in air overnight. FeFe(CN)6 nanoparticles were also prepared for comparison in a similar procedure without the use of the carbon cloth substrate.
Characterization
Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S4800) and transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100) were employed to observe the morphologies of the samples. The elemental compositions were analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping attached to the SEM instrument. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer) was used to determine the phase composition and crystallinity. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under air flow from 30 to 400 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained on a Nicolet 750 spectrometer using the KBr pellets in the range of 4000–500 cm−1. The Mössbauer spectra were taken with a Clover Technology Group, Inc. spectrometer with a 57Co γ-ray source, calibrated with α-Fe as the standard. The model fitting was performed with the WinNormos Igor 6.3 software. The X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) was recorded with a Thermo escalab 250Xi spectrometer.
Electrochemical measurements
The carbon textile-supported FeFe(CN)6 nanoparticles were directly used as the working electrode without mixing with any binder and conductive additives. The active mass loading was calculated based on the weight difference of the carbonfiber cloth before and after growth. Before weighing, the samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 110 °C overnight. Sodium pellets were employed as the counter and the reference electrode, a glass microfiber filter and 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) (1:1 by vol.) as the separator and electrolytes, respectively. The half-cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box in the laboratory with low levels of H2O and O2 below 1 ppm. For aqueous electrochemical measurements, the electrochemical characterization was carried out using a three-electrode flooded cell, where the electroactive materials grown on the carbon cloth served as the working electrodes, Pt foil served as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, and 1.0 M NaNO3 aqueous solution at pH = 2 purged with N2 before use as the electrolyte. The galvanostatic charge/discharge and CV measurements were carried out on a Land Battery Test System (Wuhan Kingnuo Electronic Co., China) and CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instruments Co., China). The EIS measurements were carried out on a Solartron 1860/1287 electrochemical interface.
