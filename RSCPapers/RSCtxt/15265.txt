However, it has been reported recently that the instability of lead halide perovskites, which are promising materials for high efficiency and low cost solar cells, can be improved by reducing the dimensions of the perovskites from the three-dimensional (3D) bulk to that of two-dimensional (2D) films. So far, there is a lack of general understanding about this unusual behavior, i.e., why a 2D slab cut out of the 3D bulk material could be more stable than the 3D material. Here, we carry out a systematic and comparative study on the thermodynamic stability of 2D and 3D perovskites using the first-principles method based on density functional theory. Taking CsPbBr3 and MAPbI3 as prototype examples, we show that the thermodynamic stability of the 2D perovskite originates from the asymmetric surface properties of this material: the AX-terminated 2D APbX3 are more stable than the PbX2-terminated 2D counterpart due to fewer surface dangling bonds. The MAI-terminated 2D MAPbI3 becomes even more stable than its 3D counterpart due to relaxation of the hydrogen bonds at the surface. Our results thus provide deep insights into the stability of 2D slabs versus 3D host materials, which shall be useful for improving the stability of perovskites and designing new 2D materials.
Introduction
Lead halide perovskites are emerging as promising solar cell materials due to their excellent optoelectronic properties and the low-cost in producing these materials.1–4 Power conversion efficiencies (PEC) of over 22% for solar cells based on lead halide perovskites have been achieved.5 However, the long-term performance of perovskite solar cells is hindered by the intrinsic thermal instability of the perovskites,6–8 which has limited their use in wide commercial application.5,9 Interestingly, recent experimental studies found that (quasi-)two-dimensional (2D) perovskites show much better stability than their 3D bulk counterparts.10–12 These layered perovskites crystallize into a Ruddlesden–Popper phase.10,12 For example, 2D CsPbBr3 with a few layer thickness13,14 and 2D CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) with thickness down to a single unit cell have been synthesized in experiments.15 The degradation speed of 2D perovskites is much slower than their 3D materials.11,12
However, the thermodynamic stability of these 2D perovskites is not well understood.11,16,17 It is not clear why a slab cut out of a 3D material could be more stable than their 3D counterpart. Moreover, the surface thermodynamic properties of lead halide perovskites are also far from clear. In general, there is a lack of systematic understanding about relative thermodynamic stability between 2D slabs and 3D host perovskites.
In this work, we conduct a systematic study on the thermodynamic properties of 2D and 3D perovskites using the first-principles method based on density functional theory (DFT). Two prototype APbX3 perovskites, CsPbBr3 and MAPbI3, are used as model systems for this purpose. The formation energy and surface energy of these perovskites are calculated and used to characterize the stability between 2D and 3D structures. It is found that AX-terminated 2D APbX3 are thermodynamically more stable than the PbX2-terminated structures due to fewer dangling bonds in the former case. In addition, significant surface relaxation, such as in the MAI-terminated 2D MAPbI3, also contributes to the stability of the 2D structures. Our findings are in agreement with experiments, and provide insight into the puzzling experimental observations.
Results and discussion
We first calculate the formation energy (Ef) of bulk APbX3 built from AX and PbX2 layers (Table 1). The calculated formation energies for orthorhombic (γ) CsPbBr3 agree well with literature values. According to the definition, negative values of Ef indicate that γ CsPbBr3 are thermodynamically stable. The formation energies of MAPbI3 are not so consistent among all calculated results. The discrepancy among these values is partially due to the sensitivity of Ef of MAPbI3 on the exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. It has been pointed out that the calculated formation energies for γ-phase MAPbI3 are highly dependent on the XC functionals used, e.g., Ef values can be negative for PBEsol and LDA, while positive for PBE and PW91.18 However, this discrepancy does not change the comparison of the relative stability between bulk and 2D perovskites when the same functional, e.g., PBEsol, is used for all calculations. Our test calculations show that the formation energy of γ-phase MAPbI3 calculated using PBEsol is consistent with the results from DFT with vdW corrections. We believe that PBEsol could provide a good description of the properties of the γ-MAPbI3 system.

Calculated values from previous references are also listed for comparison. Values of Ef taken from ref. 8 were calculated using the PBE functional and that taken from ref. 18 was calculated using the PBEsol functional. Negative formation energy indicates that the ternary compound is stable

We then discuss the thermodynamic stability of 2D perovskites using two typical materials, orthorhombic CsPbBr3 and MAPbI3 (Fig. 1). Experimental studies have shown that 2D perovskites consist of the stacking of alternate AX and PbX2 layers.13,15 The 2D slabs can be obtained by cutting through the (001) surface of the perovskites. These (001) surfaces are general to many perovskite phases, including the cubic phase. Fig. 1 displays the 2D orthorhombic CsPbBr3 as an example. When orthorhombic CsPbBr3 is cut through the (001) plane, two different surfaces, CsBr-terminated and PbBr2-terminated, appear as the termination layer. Such a cutting gives two kinds of symmetric slabs: CsBr-terminated and PbBr2-terminated (see Fig. 1(c) and (d)). The structures of 3D and 2D orthorhombic MAPbI3 are similar to those of these orthorhombic CsPbBr3. 2D perovskites with thickness of a monolayer (L1), double-layers (L2), and triple-layers (L3) are considered (see Fig. 1(c) and (d)). We calculate the formation energies of 2D CsPbBr3 and MAPbI3 with respect to the stable binary phases, CsBr (CH3NH3I) and PbBr2 (PbI2) under AX-rich and BX2-rich conditions, respectively (see the Methods section). All 2D structures are calculated in a √2 × √2 in-plane cell, as indicated in Fig. 1(a). The slab with a vacuum layer (>14 Å) extends periodically along the c direction.
 Fig. 1  Structures of 3D bulk and 2D perovskites: (a) top and (b) side view of bulk orthorhombic CsPbBr3; (c) and (d) are CsBr-terminated and PbBr2-terminated triple-layer (L3) 2D orthorhombic CsPbBr3, respectively. Although the two slabs differ with one CsBr or PbBr2 sub-layer, these slabs are all labeled as triple-layer 2D CsPbBr3 for simplicity. The structures of the monolayer (L1) and double-layers (L2) are indicated in (c) and (d). 

Fig. 2(a) shows the calculated formation energies of 2D orthorhombic CsPbBr3. It is seen that the formation energies of CsBr-terminated 2D CsPbBr3 could be much lower than those of the PbBr2-terminated structures, indicating the better thermodynamic stability of the former than the latter from energetics. This result is in agreement with a recent experimental study, where the CsBr-terminated 2D CsPbBr3 has been synthesized.13 However, the formation energies of 2D CsPbBr3 derived slabs are still higher than that of 3D CsPbBr3 for all kinds of slabs considered, indicating less thermodynamic stability of 2D CsPbBr3 in comparison with the 3D counterpart. The formation energy of 2D CsPbBr3 increases with reducing thickness, implying less stability for thinner structures.
 Fig. 2  Formation energies (Ef, eV per f.u.) of 2D orthorhombic CsPbBr3 (a) and orthorhombic MAPbI3 (b). Symmetric relaxed AX-terminated slabs (squares) and PbX2-terminated slabs (triangles) are presented for three different thicknesses, i.e. L1, L2, and L3. The symbols are connected by lines for a better view. The formation energy of bulk APbX3 is indicated by a horizontal dashed line. [Ef (CsPbBr3-orthorhombic) = −0.22 eV; Ef (MAPbI3) = −0.06 eV, see Table 1]. 
Termination-dependent 2D (AX- or PbX2-) stability is more obvious in MAPbI3, as shown in Fig. 2(b). It is seen that the formation energies of MAI-terminated slabs are much lower than those of PbI2-terminated slabs, suggesting much better stability of MAI-terminated slabs. Interestingly, the formation energies of MAI-terminated 2D MAPbI3 become even lower than that of their 3D bulk. Particularly, we note that the formation energy of the MAI-terminated monolayer is about 0.03 eV lower than that of the 3D bulk. Therefore, the bare MAI-terminated 2D MAPbI3 monolayer could be more stable than its 3D counterpart. This is a surprising result considering that the energy of a 2D slab is usually expected to be higher than its 3D counterpart. Recently, 2D MAPbI3 with thickness down to a single unit cell have been synthesized in experiments.15 Negative values of formation energies of the MAI-terminated 2D MAPbI3 support the stability of these ultrathin 2D perovskites.
To better understand the origin of the termination-dependent (AX- or PbX2-) stability of 2D perovskites, we calculate the surface energy of APbX3 perovskites. The calculated surface energies of the (001) surfaces for the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 and MAPbI3 are listed in Table 2. Note that the surface energy of the AX-terminated surface is much lower than that of the PbX2-terminated surface for both unrelaxed and relaxed cases. Moreover, the MAI-terminated surface shows extremely low surface energy that can be even negative. This suggests a very unusual stability of the MAI-terminated surface. These results indicate that the better stability of AX-terminated 2D perovskites, especially for MAI-terminated 2D MAPbI3, is due to the lower surface energy of AX-terminated surfaces.

The surface energies of AX-terminated surfaces are calculated at the chemical potential conditions of their most stable states, i.e. AX-rich (in equilibrium with the AX bulk), while those of PbX2-terminated surfaces are calculated at the corresponding PbX2-rich chemical potential conditions

To reveal the origin of the difference in surface energy between AX-terminated and PbX2-terminated surfaces, we first focus on unrelaxed CsPbBr3 and MAPbI3 surfaces (ideal cases), where atoms are located at the positions as in their bulk materials. From Table 2, the differences in surface energies between two types of unrelaxed surfaces are 0.16 eV for CsPbBr3 and 0.25 eV for MAPbI3. The lower energy of the AX-terminated surface could be attributed to the fact that the AX-terminated surface has less surface dangling bonds and moreover, the A-X bond is weaker than the Pb–X bond due to its high ionicity. Larger ionicity usually results in lower surface energy, as demonstrated for common semiconductors.19 From Table 2, it is also seen that relaxation plays an important role in decreasing the surface energy. The surface energies of CsBr- and PbBr2-terminated surfaces are reduced by 0.08 eV and 0.06 eV, respectively. Notably, the surface energy of the MAI-terminated surface is decreased by 0.24 eV, and becomes negative after relaxation. In contrast, the relaxation of the PbI2-terminated surface shows a much smaller effect with a reduction of only 0.04 eV. These results indicate that surface relaxation produces a larger effect on decreasing the surface energy of the AX-terminated surface than the PbX2-terminated surface, especially for the MAI-terminated surface. Therefore, apart from the difference of bonding characters between two types of surfaces, surface relaxation enlarges the difference of surface energies between two types of surfaces, especially for MAPbI3. In MAPbI3, relaxation largely enhances the stability of the MAI-terminated 2D structure. We then check the structural changes after relaxation of the MAPbI3 surfaces to find out the origin of the distinct relaxation effect on the two types of surfaces. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the MA molecules at the surface reorient with the NH3 fragment pointing into the inner layers after relaxation for the MAI-terminated 2D MAPbI3. In contrast, changes in the surface structure are negligible for the PbI2-terminated surface (see Fig. 3(b)). These results are consistent with the fact that a much larger relaxation effect on surface energy is present for the MAI-terminated than the PbI2-terminated surface. It is also reasonable due to the more number of degrees of freedoms in the MA subunit in comparison with the PbI2. Relaxation in CsPbBr3 slabs leads to the rumpling of CsBr and PbBr2 atomic layers, i.e. relative displacement of cations and anions along the c direction. For example, with relaxation, Cs+ moves inward toward the center of the slab, while Br− moves outward for the surface CsBr layer.
 Fig. 3  (a) Shows the structure change after relaxation for MA-terminated double-layers; (b) is the case of PbI2-terminated double-layers; (c) changes of hydrogen bonding interaction upon relaxation. Numbers (in unit of Å) are the hydrogen bond length N–H⋯I. For the unrelaxed structure (left), except for these two designated H⋯I bond lengths, other H⋯I lengths (H on N) are about 4 Å. MA molecules fill in the Pb–I frame. Structural changes in the monolayer and triple-layers resemble those in double-layers. 
To find out the reason of reorientation of MA molecules, we measure the H⋯I bond lengths for H atoms bonded to the N atom. In γ-MAPbI3, there exist three hydrogen bonds (N–H⋯I) per MA-ion: one with the length of 2.55 Å and other two with the length of 2.56 Å. One of the three hydrogen bonds is broken when the slab is cut from the bulk. Relaxation enhances the hydrogen bonding interaction at the surface for the MAI-terminated slab, while this effect is missing in the PbI2-terminated slab. Fig. 3(c) shows the detailed structure changes with bond lengths marked together with atomic structures. It is seen that relaxation leads to the appearance of two more N–H⋯I bonds with the bond length of 2.69 and 3.00 Å. The length of the shorter hydrogen bond is in the range of strong hydrogen bonding, as demonstrated in previous studies.20,21 Another relatively weak hydrogen bonding also contributes to the interaction of the NH3 fragment with the iodine anion. Therefore, the strong hydrogen bonding interaction at the surface lowers the total energy of MAI-terminated slabs, which contributes to the lowered formation energy of MAI terminated slabs. The effect of hydrogen-bonding on stabilizing hybrid perovskites has also been found in the orthorhombic bulk.20,22 Based on DFT calculations, Lee et al. found that hydrogen bonding stabilizes the tilt of octahedra in the orthorhombic phase.22 Moreover, a barrier for MA rotation along its C–N direction is calculated to be 102 meV per MA-ion, implying the strong hydrogen-bonding in the orthorhombic phase.20
Now we turn to the interesting question, whether MAPbI3 spontaneously decomposes into 2D structures or not, since the surface energy of the MAI-terminated surface is negative. The decomposition could occur by cleaving bulk MAPbI3 along the (001) surface. If the cleaving process is exothermic, the decomposition could occur. However, because the cleavage actually creates two inequivalent AX- and PbX2-terminated surfaces, we need to calculate the sum of surface energy of AX- and PbX2-terminated surfaces, which is related to the cleavage. The calculated cleavage energies of the (001) surface for the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 and MAPbI3 are listed in Table 3. Positive cleavage energies for these compounds indicate that cleaving the bulk and thus forming two surfaces is an energy-cost process, even though one of the surfaces could have negative surface energy. Therefore, bulk states of CsPbBr3 and MAPbI3 are more thermodynamically stable than decomposing into slabs, that is, there is no possibility in spontaneous decomposition of 3D perovskites into 2D structures. However, because the formation energies of MAI-terminated 2D MAPbI3 can be comparable to or even more negative than that of the 3D counterpart, non-stoichiometric growth of 2D MAPbI3 under MAI-rich conditions can lead to stable 2D MAPbI3 slabs. In contrast, the formation energies of PbI2-terminated 2D MAPbI3 increase significantly from its bulk value, and therefore, formation of PbI2 terminated 2D slabs is not expected.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we studied the stability of 2D lead halide perovskites by using the DFT method. Our results show that AX-terminated 2D APbX3 are thermodynamically more stable than the PbX2-terminated 2D structures. Surprisingly, although the formation energies of 2D CsPbBr3 and PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 are higher than their 3D counterpart, as expected, the stability of MAI-terminated 2D MAPbI3 becomes comparable to or even better than their 3D bulk. We find that the thermodynamic stability of the 2D AX-terminated perovskites originates from the asymmetric surface properties of these materials: fewer surface dangling bonds and more ionicity of the AX layer, as well as significant surface relaxation. These factors lead to low surface energy for the AX-terminated surface. Particularly, in MAPbI3, we find that structural relaxation enhances the hydrogen bonding interaction at the surface and thus enhances the stability of MAI-terminated 2D MAPbI3. The observation that one surface could be more stable than the complementary one is a universal phenomenon, which can be utilized to design more stable structures such as 2D MAI-terminated slabs. Our finding thus provides insights into the thermodynamic stability of 2D versus 3D materials. Experimental tests of our predictions are called for.
Methods
All calculations were done within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).23–25 The projector augmented-wave (PAW) method was used to describe the electron–core interaction.26 PBEsol was used as the exchange-correlation functional in structural relaxations and calculations of total energy.27 A kinetic energy cutoff of 350 eV and 500 eV were used to perform calculations for CsPbBr3 and MAPbI3, respectively. A Monkhorst–Pack mesh of 8 × 8 × 8 was used for cubic perovskite cells and scaled meshes were used for other bulks and slabs. Our test calculations show that spin-orbital coupling (SOC) does not change our main conclusion and thus SOC is not considered in the calculations. Formation energy, surface energy, and cleavage energy were calculated according to the following definitions.
The formation energies of 3D and 2D perovskites (CsPbBr3 and MAPbI3) were calculated with respect to decomposed component phases (CsPbBr3: PbBr2/CsBr; MAPbI3: PbI2/MAI). The initial structures of bulk γ-CsPbBr3 and γ-MAPbI3 were taken from experimental studies and were then relaxed.28,29 All crystal structures of binaries studied here are taken at their most stable polymorph under ambient conditions; particularly, for the ground state structure of MAI, we used a tetragonal structure.30
The formation energies (Ef) of 3D and 2D perovskites are defined as follows:
3D bulk: Ef(ABX3) = EABX3 − EAX − EBX2(1)
2D n layer (Ln) AX-terminated ABX3 under AX-rich conditions (in contact with a reservoir of bulk AX): Ef(An+1BnX3n+1) = [EAn+1BnX3n+1 − (n + 1)EAX − nEBX2]/n(2)
2D n layer (Ln) BX2-terminated ABX3 under BX2-rich conditions (in contact with a reservoir of bulk BX2): Ef(AnBn+1X3n+2) = [EAnBn+1X3n+2 − nEAX − (n + 1)EBX2]/n(3)where E is the total energy of 3D bulks, 2D slab ternary perovskites, and related bulk binaries. According to the definitions, negative formation energies indicate that the ternary system is thermodynamically stable.
Surface energy is calculated by simply considering the chemical potential of component binary phases of perovskites. This method has been used to calculate the surface energy of oxide perovskites.31 Using CsPbBr3 as an example, the surface energy is calculated as follows: (4)where Eslab is the total energy of the slab, NCsBr and NPbBr2 are the numbers of formula unit of CsBr and PbBr2 in the slab, and μCsBr and μPbBr2 are the corresponding chemical potentials. The factor of 1/2 accounts for two identical surfaces existing in the slab. Since the surface is in equilibrium with the bulk, the chemical potential μi should satisfy the following conditions: μCsBr + μPbBr2 = μCsPbBr3 = ECsPbBr3(5) μCsBr ≤ ECsBr(6) μPbBr2 ≤ EPbBr2(7)where ECsBr, EPbBr2 and ECsPbBr3 are the total energies of bulk binary and ternary compounds. Ef = ECsPbBr3 − ECsBr − EPbBr2 is the formation energy of the ternary compound with respect to the binary compounds. We can see that only one chemical potential is an independent variable. The variation range of chemical potential is set by avoiding the precipitation of either bulk CsBr or bulk PbBr2. For example, the condition μPbBr2 = EPbBr2 corresponds to a system in equilibrium with PbBr2 bulk (PbBr2-rich condition), while μPbBr2 = EPbBr2 + Ef corresponds to the PbBr2-poor condition or CsBr-rich condition.
For symmetric (001) slab of perovskites, using eqn (5), (4) can be rewritten as follows: ECsBrsurf = 1/2(ECsBrslab − NPbBr2ECsPbBr3 − μCsBr)(8)for the CsBr-terminated slab, and (9)for the PbBr2-terminated slab. Based on these two equations, we calculate the surface energies of CsPbBr3 and MAPbI3 using triple-layer slabs. Our test calculations for CsPbBr3 slabs show that the triple-layer slab is thick enough to obtain converged surface energy. Thus, triple-layer slabs with two types of terminations for both CsPbBr3 and MAPbI3 are used to calculate the surface energy. Note that the surface energies of AX-terminated surfaces are calculated at the chemical potential conditions of their most stable states, i.e. the AX-rich condition (in equilibrium with the AX bulk), while those of PbX2-terminated surfaces are calculated at the corresponding PbX2-rich chemical potential conditions.
We also calculate the cleavage energy (Ecl) of two AX- and PbX2-terminated surfaces. Using CsPbBr3 as an example, we obtain (10)where NCsPbBr3is the total number of formula unit of bulk CsPbBr3 in two slabs. Note that Ecl is independent of chemical potential. In this definition, Ecl is the energy cost in cleaving the bulk CsPbBr3 along the (001) surface. The Ecl of CsPbBr3 and MAPbI3 is calculated in the triple-layer thick slab, with which converged cleavage energy can be obtained.

 	Fig. 1  Structures of 3D bulk and 2D perovskites: (a) top and (b) side view of bulk orthorhombic CsPbBr3; (c) and (d) are CsBr-terminated and PbBr2-terminated triple-layer (L3) 2D orthorhombic CsPbBr3, respectively. Although the two slabs differ with one CsBr or PbBr2 sub-layer, these slabs are all labeled as triple-layer 2D CsPbBr3 for simplicity. The structures of the monolayer (L1) and double-layers (L2) are indicated in (c) and (d).	 

 	Fig. 2  Formation energies (Ef, eV per f.u.) of 2D orthorhombic CsPbBr3 (a) and orthorhombic MAPbI3 (b). Symmetric relaxed AX-terminated slabs (squares) and PbX2-terminated slabs (triangles) are presented for three different thicknesses, i.e. L1, L2, and L3. The symbols are connected by lines for a better view. The formation energy of bulk APbX3 is indicated by a horizontal dashed line. [Ef (CsPbBr3-orthorhombic) = −0.22 eV; Ef (MAPbI3) = −0.06 eV, see Table 1].

 	Fig. 3  (a) Shows the structure change after relaxation for MA-terminated double-layers; (b) is the case of PbI2-terminated double-layers; (c) changes of hydrogen bonding interaction upon relaxation. Numbers (in unit of Å) are the hydrogen bond length N–H⋯I. For the unrelaxed structure (left), except for these two designated H⋯I bond lengths, other H⋯I lengths (H on N) are about 4 Å. MA molecules fill in the Pb–I frame. Structural changes in the monolayer and triple-layers resemble those in double-layers.
