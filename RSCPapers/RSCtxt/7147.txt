    , Accepted 6th September 2018First published on 13th September 2018AbstractA novel strategy involving judiciously fusing one thiophene/thieno[3,2-b]thiophene on only one side of an indacenodithiophene (IDT) unit to extend IDT backbone conjugation was developed, and three A–D–A type non-fullerene small molecules (TPT-2F, TPTT-2F, and TPTTT-2F) were designed and synthesized to investigate the influence of the extent of IDT core conjugation on their photovoltaic properties. Extending the IDT core conjugation could broaden absorption, upshift the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, enhance electron mobility, and increase intermolecular π–π stacking. When these three non-fullerene acceptors were applied in organic solar cells (OSCs), simultaneous enhancement of the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) was obtained, with the degree of enhancement following the order TPT-2F < TPTT-2F < TPTTT-2F. As a result, the TPTTT-2F based OSCs yielded a high PCE of 12.03%. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 12.03% is among the highest values for asymmetric non-fullerene acceptor based OSCs so far. These results demonstrate that extending the conjugation of the IDT core is an effective approach to design highly efficient asymmetric non-fullerene acceptors.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have aroused considerable research interest among the academic and industrial communities, owing to their distinctive advantages of low cost, light weight, mechanical flexibility, and solution processability.1 Generally, the photoactive layers of OSCs are fabricated with a bulk heterojunction structure composed of a polymer donor and an n-type semiconductor acceptor. In the past few decades, fullerene derivatives played a dominant role as n-type semiconductor acceptors, due to their high electron mobility and superior isotropic charge transporting abilities.2,3 However, they suffer from several inherent shortcomings, including high production cost, weak absorption in the visible region, and limited molecular energy level tunability, which restrict their further applications in OSCs.4 On the other hand, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have emerged as a promising alternative to replace fullerene derivatives in the last few years,5–8 and significant advancements in non-fullerene-based OSCs have been achieved, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching 14%.9 In the design and synthesis of non-fullerene acceptors, an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) backbone architecture is thought to be beneficial for enhancing the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).10–15 In such A–D–A type NFAs, the D and A are a fused-ring electron donating core unit and an electron accepting terminal unit, respectively. Through rational chemical modification and proper selection of the D and/or A unit, the absorption spectra, molecular energy levels, push–pull effect, and intermolecular interactions of the resultant NFAs can be fine-tuned.7
For the A unit, 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) has become one of the most widely used end-capping groups in the design of efficient NFAs.12,16,17 Monofluorination of the IC end-capping group is a simple approach to further enhance the ICT effect without significantly decreasing the open-circuit voltage (Voc).18 Additionally, introducing one fluorine atom onto the IC end-capping group is also advantageous for enhancing the charge transporting abilities of the resultant NFAs, which could be partly ascribed to the formation of C–F⋯H, C–F⋯S, and C–F⋯π noncovalent interactions.19 Accordingly, these promising properties of monofluorinated IC end-capping groups have proved to be effective in designing highly efficient NFAs.11,20,21
For the D unit, the use of the five-membered indacenodithiophene (IDT) moiety has become a popular approach to designing A–D–A type NFAs.22,23 To further tune the ICT effect for a given A unit, several methods have been adopted to modify the chemical structure of the IDT core unit, such as core conjugation regulation,12,24,25 heteroatom substitution,26 side chain engineering,27–31 and π-spacer modulation,32–36 among others. In particular, the modulation of IDT core conjugation has effectively promoted the development of NFAs.9,12,25 For example, Zhan et al. reported a symmetric star-shaped compound ITIC, in which one thiophene is fused to each side of the five-membered central core IDT unit.12 By fusing one thieno[3,2-b]thiophene on each side of the IDT unit, the same group reported a new nine-membered IDT derivative referred to as the symmetric IBDT unit, and designed a corresponding high-performance non-fullerene acceptor INIC3 with an outstanding PCE of 11.5%.25
Modulation of the core conjugation via fusing one thiophene or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene on each side of the five-membered IDT unit generally leads to symmetric IDT derivatives. However, very limited attempts have been devoted toward fusing a thiophene or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene to only one side of an IDT unit, which could be partly ascribed to challenging synthesis and purification of such compounds.16,37,38 Intriguingly, different from the approach of fusing one thiophene or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene to each side of the IDT unit, the strategy of fusing a thiophene or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene on only one side of the IDT unit could result in novel asymmetric IDT derivatives, which would provide a new method to adjust the conjugation of the symmetric IDT core. Moreover, there is very limited research on the influence of different extents of IDT core conjugation on the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding asymmetric A–D–A type NFAs (Fig. 1).39–41
 Fig. 1  (a) Traditional method to extend IDT backbone conjugation; (b) novel strategy to extend IDT backbone conjugation. 
Very recently, we have reported a novel asymmetric TPTT unit, which integrates thiophene (T), phenylene (P), and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) units into a single fused molecular entity.16 This molecular configuration not only makes the TPTT unit asymmetric, but also extends the conjugation length of TPTT compared to the IDT unit. In order to further extend the backbone conjugation, in this contribution, we designed and synthesized a novel IDT derivative, TPTTT, in which thiophene (T), phenylene (P), and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (TTT) segments are condensed with two embedded cyclopentadienyl moieties. From the five-membered IDT unit to the six-membered TPTT unit and seven-membered TPTTT unit, the backbone conjugation, π-electron delocalization and electron donating ability would be progressively extended. It was expected that the ICT between the central core unit and the terminal accepting unit would also be enhanced sequentially when these three units were applied in A–D–A type NFAs.
In this work, to take advantage of the monofluorination of the IC end-capping group and investigate the impact of different IDT backbone conjugation lengths on the photovoltaic properties of NFAs, the TPT, TPTT, and TPTTT units are used as the central electron donating core unit in conjunction with a monofluorinated IC end-capping group as the terminal electron accepting unit. The symmetric NFA TPT-2F and the asymmetric NFAs TPTT-2F and TPTTT-2F were synthesized (Fig. 2), and the red shift of the absorption spectrum, LUMO energy level, and electron mobility were found to follow the order TPT-2F < TPTT-2F < TPTTT-2F. As a result, the OSCs based on PBT1-C:TPTTT-2F delivered a maximum PCE of 12.03% with an open-circuit (Voc) of 0.916 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 17.63 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.745, which were superior to the performance of the PBT1-C:TPT-2F and PBT1-C:TPTT-2F devices. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 12.03% is among highest values for asymmetric non-fullerene acceptor based OSCs at present.16,37,38,42 These results demonstrate that extending the IDT core conjugation is an effective way to design highly efficient asymmetric non-fullerene acceptors. More importantly, extending the IDT core conjugation length in A–D–A type nonfullerene acceptors enables simultaneous increases in Voc, Jsc, and FF, thus resulting in high PCEs.

Results and discussion
The syntheses of TPT-2F, TPTT-2F, and TPTTT-2F are shown in Scheme 1. Firstly, compound 1 was reacted with tributyl(dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophen-2-yl)stannane via the Stille coupling reaction to produce compound 2. Then, the treatment of compound 2 with (4-hexylphenyl)lithium afforded two benzyl alcohols, followed by a ring-closure reaction by treatment with BF3 etherate to yield the novel asymmetric building block TPTTT. Afterwards, TPTTT was reacted with n-butyllithium followed by treatment with dry DMF to afford TPTTT-CHO. Finally, the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of the monofluorinated IC end-capping group with TPT-CHO, TPTT-CHO, or TPTTT-CHO yielded non-fullerene small molecules TPT-2F, TPTT-2F, and TPTTT-2F, respectively. All the intermediates and the three non-fullerene small molecules were thoroughly characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS (ESI†). In addition, these three non-fullerene small molecules could be readily dissolved in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, and chlorobenzene.

The normalized absorption spectra of the three NFAs in dilute chloroform solution and thin films are shown in Fig. 3, and the related data are presented in Table 1. In dilute chloroform solution, maximum absorption peaks located at 662, 675, and 687 nm were observed for TPT-2F, TPTT-2F, and TPTTT-2F, respectively, along with a prominent shoulder peak for each NFA. The thin film of each NFA exhibited a broader absorption spectrum and a red-shifted absorption maximum relative to the corresponding solution. Specifically, the absorption maxima of TPT-2F, TPTT-2F, and TPTTT-2F were red-shifted from 662 to 698 nm, from 675 to 717 nm, and from 687 to 724 nm, respectively, suggesting strong intermolecular interactions among these three NFAs in the solid state. The absorption onsets of the TPT-2F, TPTT-2F, and TPTTT-2F thin films were located at 754, 785, and 794 nm, which corresponded to optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of 1.64, 1.58, and 1.56 eV, respectively. The progressive red shift in the absorption spectra and narrowing of the bandgap from symmetrical TPT-2F to asymmetric TPTT-2F and TPTTT-2F could be ascribed to the extended IDT core conjugation and stronger electron-donating ability.43

The frontier molecular orbitals and corresponding energy levels of the three NFAs, which were calculated using the density functional theory (DFT) method at the B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level, are depicted in Fig. S1.† For all three NFAs, the electron density of the HOMO was mainly localized on the central electron-donating unit, while the electron density of the LUMO was well distributed over both the central core unit and the terminal monofluorinated IC end-capping group. The calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels of TPT-2F, TPTT-2F, and TPTTT-2F were −5.74/−3.51 eV, −5.64/−3.47 eV, and −5.57/−3.44 eV, respectively, suggesting that extending the IDT core conjugation upshifted both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels.
The electrochemical properties of the three NFAs were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry measurements. As shown in Fig. 3c, the onset oxidation/reduction potentials of TPT-2F, TPTT-2F, and TPTTT-2F were measured to be 1.47/−0.31, 1.38/−0.33 and 1.33/−0.36 V, respectively. From these potentials, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of TPT-2F, TPTT-2F, and TPTTT-2F were determined to be −5.84/−4.06, −5.75/−4.04 and −5.70/−4.01 eV, respectively. These results indicated that extending the IDT core conjugation upshifted both HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which was in good agreement with the results of the DFT calculation. In addition, the shifts in the HOMO energy levels were more pronounced than those of the LUMO energy levels.39 It is worth noting that, due to the longer core conjugation length and stronger electron-donating ability of TPTTT compared to those of TPT and TPTT, TPTTT-2F exhibited a higher LUMO energy level relative to the other two NFAs, which would be beneficial for obtaining a higher Voc in OSCs.
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the three NFAs, we chose PBT1-C, which was recently reported by our group,44 as the donor to fabricate bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/PBT1-C:NFA/MoO3/Ag. We carefully investigated the device processing conditions, including the donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio and the content of the additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), to obtain the best photovoltaic performance. The optimal D/A weight ratio and DIO content were found to be 1:1 and 0.25%, respectively. The resulting PBT1-C:TPTTT-2F device delivered an optimal PCE of 12.03% with a Voc of 0.916 V, a Jsc of 17.63 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.745. These values were superior to the optimal PCE of 8.33%, Voc of 0.874 V, Jsc of 13.89 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.686 for the PBT1-C:TPT-2F device, and to the optimal PCE of 10.17%, Voc of 0.881 V, Jsc of 15.82 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.73 for the PBT1-C:TPTT-2F device. Moreover, the optimized PBT1-C:TPTTT-2F device exhibited an energy loss of 0.644 eV, which was lower than the energy loss of 0.766 eV for the optimized PBT1-C:TPT-2F device and 0.699 eV for the optimized PBT1-C:TPTT-2F device. These results demonstrated that the TPTTT-2F based device with more extended IDT core conjugation not only exhibited a lower energy loss, but also simultaneously achieved a higher Voc, higher Jsc, and higher FF, thus leading to a higher PCE. The J–V curves and corresponding photovoltaic data of the optimized device are provided in Fig. 4a and Table 2, respectively.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimized devices are displayed in Fig. 4b. From the PBT1-C:TPT-2F to the PBT1-C:TPTT-2F and PBT1-C:TPTTT-2F devices, the maximum EQE value gradually increased, and the photoresponse was extended to longer wavelengths. As a result, the PBT1-C:TPTTT-2F device exhibited a high integrated Jsc of 16.88 mA cm−2, which was higher than the Jsc values of 13.41 mA cm−2 for the PBT1-C:TPT-2F device and 15.23 mA cm−2 for the PBT1-C:TPTT-2F device. These results indicated that the TPTTT-2F based device with the most extended conjugation showed more efficient photon harvesting and charge collection efficiency. Moreover, these integrated Jsc values agreed well with the Jsc values obtained from J–V curves, within 5% mismatch.
The charge transport properties of the three NFA films and the corresponding blend films were investigated via space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement. The average electron mobilities of the neat TPT-2F, TPTT-2F, and TPTTT-2F films were measured to be 4.17 × 10−4, 4.53 × 10−4, and 4.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. These results demonstrated that extending the IDT core conjugation in NFAs enhanced the electron mobility. After blending with PBT1-C, the average hole/electron mobilities of the PBT1-C:TPT-2F, PBT1-C:TPTT-2F, and PBT1-C:TPTTT-2F devices were determined to be 3.51 × 10−4/0.71 × 10−4, 3.05 × 10−4/1.62 × 10−4, and 2.30 × 10−4/2.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, corresponding to μh/μe ratios of 4.94, 1.88, and 1.04, respectively. The more balanced μh/μe ratio of the PBT1-C:TPTTT-2F device compared to the other two devices helps to explain the higher FF obtained in the corresponding OSC.
To study their exciton dissociation and charge collection properties, the photocurrent density (Jph) of the OSCs was measured as a function of the effective voltage (Veff). As shown in Fig. 4c, the Jph values reached saturation at a high Veff (>2 V), demonstrating that all the photogenerated excitons were effectively dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by the electrodes. The Jsat of the PBT1-C:TPTTT-2F device was slightly higher than that of the other two devices, suggesting that the PBT1-C:TPTTT-2F device showed improved charge generation and thus enhanced Jsc.45 Under the short circuit conditions, the Jph/Jsat ratios of the PBT1-C:TPT-2F, PBT1-C:TPTT-2F, and PBT1-C:TPTTT-2F devices were calculated to be 94.32%, 95.93%, and 96.06%, respectively, suggesting that the PBT1-C:TPTTT-2F device had more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency than the other two devices.39
To study the charge recombination behavior, the dependence of the photocurrent (Jph) on the light intensity (Plight) was measured (Fig. 4d). The relationship between Jsc and P can be described by the formula Jsc ∝ PlightS, where the exponential factor S is an indicator of the extent of bimolecular recombination. As shown in Fig. 4d, the S values of the PBT1-C:TPT-2F, PBT1-C:TPTT-2F, and PBT1-C:TPTTT-2F devices were estimated to be 0.981, 0.990, and 0.999, respectively, suggesting that bimolecular charge recombination was effectively suppressed in all three devices. In particular, the PBT1-C:TPTTT-2F device exhibited weaker bimolecular recombination than the other two devices, which could contribute to its higher FF.
The film morphologies of the blend films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 5, all the blend films showed smooth and uniform surfaces. The root mean square (RMS) roughness of the PBT1-C:TPTTT-2F film (1.21 nm) was smaller than those of the PBT1-C:TPT-2F (1.46 nm) and PBT1-C:TPTT-2F (1.57 nm) films. Moreover, the blend films exhibited obvious fibrous features as seen in the AFM phase image, which are favorable for efficient charge transport.

The molecular orientation and their packing structures in both neat and blend films were investigated by grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. The 2D diffraction patterns and the corresponding line-cuts are presented in Fig. 6. It can be seen that TPTT-2F and TPTTT-2F NFAs in neat films adopt a dominant face-on orientation, showing a strong (100) lamellar scattering in the in-plane (IP) direction and a (010) π–π stacking peak in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. However, in the case of TPT-2F, much weaker scatterings were measured, indicating the extended π-conjugation with thienothiophene and cyclopentadithiophene in the IDT core of NFA structures increases the intermolecular ordering with enhanced cofacial π–π stacking. The crystal coherence length (CCL) values extracted from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the IP (100) peak confirm this trend (28.1 Å for TPT-2F, 36.5 Å for TPTT-2F and 36.9 Å for TPTTT-2F, respectively). With regard to the blend films, a similar trend was measured. A (100) diffraction peak at q = 0.26 Å−1 appeared, corresponding to the lamellar diffraction of PBT1-C. When blended with PBT1-C, the OOP (010) diffraction peak of TPT-2F, TPTT-2F and TPTTT-2F is still clear, indicating that they still adopt a predominant face-on orientation in the blend films. Moreover, from PBT1-C:TPT-2F, PBT1-C:TPTT-2F to PBT1-C:TPTTT-2F, the OOP (010) diffraction peak becomes gradually intensified, which is beneficial for charge transport in a vertical direction.

Conclusions
In conclusion, one symmetric non-fullerene acceptor, TPT-2F, and two asymmetric non-fullerene acceptors, TPTT-2F and TPTTT-2F, were synthesized. The influence of the extent of the IDT core conjugation on the electronic properties, charge carrier transport, film morphology, and photovoltaic properties was systematically investigated. From TPT-2F to TPTT-2F and TPTTT-2F, more red-shifted absorption, smaller optical bandgaps, upshifted LUMO energy levels, higher electron mobilities, and stronger intermolecular π–π stacking were obtained. When blended with PBT1-C, the Voc, Jsc, and FF of the resulting devices improved simultaneously in the order PBT1-C:TPT-2F < PBT1-C:TPTT-2F < PBT1-C:TPTTT-2F. As a result, the PBT1-C:TPTTT-2F device achieved a high PCE of 12.03%, which was much higher than that of the PBT1-C:TPTT-2F device (10.17%) and the PBT1-C:TPT-2F device (8.33%). These results show that extending the conjugation length of the IDT core in A–D–A type non-fullerene acceptors is an effective way to enhance their photovoltaic parameters simultaneously, and thus to achieve high PCEs.
