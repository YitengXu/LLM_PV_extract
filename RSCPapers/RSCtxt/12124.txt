    , Accepted 2nd November 2014First published on 10th November 2014AbstractHigh energy conversion efficiencies of 6.6% and 7.5% are demonstrated in solid and liquid states, Pt-free, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), respectively, based on CoS nanoparticles on an organized mesoporous SnO2 (om-SnO2) counter electrode. These results correspond to improvements of 14% and 9%, respectively, compared to a conventional Pt counter electrode and are among the highest values reported for Pt-free DSSCs. The om-SnO2 layer plays a pivotal role as a platform to deposit a large amount of highly electrocatalytically active CoS nanoparticles via a facile solvothermal reaction. The om-SnO2 platform with a high porosity, larger pores, and good interconnectivity is derived from a poly(vinyl chloride)-g-poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (PVC-g-POEM) graft copolymer template, which provides not only improved interaction sites for the formation of CoS nanoparticles but also enhanced electron transport. The structural, morphological, chemical, and electrochemical properties of CoS on the om-SnO2 platform are investigated using field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. The performance enhancement results from the excellent electron transport at the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/counter electrode/electrolyte interface, reduced resistance at the FTO/CoS interface, and better catalytic reduction at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising devices as they are expected to provide a solution to global warming and energy source issues due to their low cost, easy fabrication, and relatively high efficiency compared to conventional silicon-based solar cells.1 Considerable efforts have been undertaken to improve their cell efficiency and stability based on functional photoanode materials,2–5 an efficient redox electrolyte,6,7 novel sensitizers with large absorption coefficients,8 and a flexible substrate.9 In particular, the counter electrode is not only an essential component of DSSCs due to its high cost, but it also plays a significant role in determining cell performance because the electrons that are supplied through the counter electrode have to be sufficient to reduce the redox electrolyte couples that are oxidized for sensitizer regeneration. Hence, an ideal counter electrode must possess high electrical conductivity for electron collecting, a large specific surface area for the counter electrode/electrolyte contact, and excellent catalytic activity for the reaction of the electrolytes. In this respect, platinum (Pt) has been recognized as the most suitable counter electrode in DSSCs due to its superior electrocatalytic activity, high electrical conductivity, and good stability.10,11 Nevertheless, the Pt counter electrode is one of the most expensive components of a DSSC, and hence, may pose problems in large scale manufacturing. Therefore, the fabrication of counter electrodes based on Pt-free, low-cost, and highly catalytic active materials is essential for future industrial applications of DSSCs.12–15
Potential alternative counter electrode materials to replace conventional Pt should be endowed with a high electrocatalytic activity, electrical conductivity, stability, and low cost. To address these constraints, several alternative materials such as carbon,16 carbon nanotubes,17 metal oxides,18 metal nitrides,19 graphene,20 conductive polymers21a and metal chalcogenides21b,c have been investigated. Recently, our group reported an electrostatic self-assembly process for the preparation of nickel sulfide with high catalytic activity for use as counter electrodes in DSSCs.22 The reduced interfacial resistance at the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/counter electrode/electrolyte, as well as the greater electrocatalytic activity of nickel sulfide, leads to an improved fill factor, and thus higher efficiency than conventional Pt counter electrode systems. Furthermore, their low-temperature procedure capability results in enormous potential for their use in flexible photovoltaic systems. In recent years, cobalt sulfides (CoS) have also been proposed for the counter electrode of DSSCs due to their excellent electrocatalytic ability. For example, Ho's group prepared CoS acicular nanorod arrays on a FTO substrate via a two-step approach and obtained a slightly lower efficiency (7.67%) than that of a conventional Pt counter electrode system (7.70%).23 Tuan's group also achieved a high device performance of 7% by using Co9S8 nanocrystals as a cost-effective counter electrode material in DSSCs.24 Very recently, Yu's group reported that CoS hierarchical nanospheres in the counter electrode in DSSCs showed higher catalytic properties.25 However, it is still challenging to employ a simple process for preparing CoS catalysts with excellent electrocatalytic properties, higher density, and greater surface area as a low-cost alternative to Pt in DSSCs.
Of particular interest are organized mesoporous structures with a higher crystalline framework, larger specific surface area, and tunable pores, which make them ideal candidates for photovoltaic-related applications such as DSSCs. For example, Snaith's group reported a bi-continuous, well-organized TiO2 photoanode structure based on the poly(isoprene-b-styrene-b-ethylene oxide) triblock copolymer, which exhibited a higher photovoltaic performance than that of a less-organized nanoparticle-based system.26 Wu's group prepared a Pt-impregnated mesoporous Nb-doped TiO2 structure for use as a catalytic activity-enhanced counter electrode.27 Moreover, our group recently reported an organized mesoporous SnO2 interfacial layer on the FTO substrate templated by a graft copolymer, i.e., poly(vinyl chloride)-g-poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (PVC-g-POEM).28a More recently, well-organized mesoporous structures with a higher crystalline framework, larger specific surface area, and tunable pores demonstrated an excellent photoanode in DSSSs due to its high porosity, ordered pores, interconnectivity, and light harvesting.28b One way to further enhance the device performance is the application of an organized mesoporous SnO2 film to the counter electrode, which can improve the electron transport and reduce interfacial resistance. Moreover, organized mesoporous SnO2 structures have many coordinative interaction sites such as hydroxyl groups, which serve as a platform to facilitate the nucleation and successful growth of catalytic materials. It is well known that the electron mobility of SnO2 (100–200 cm2/VS) is comparable to conventional FTO substrates, which are responsible for enhanced electron transport and minimized interfacial charge recombination.28c,d Moreover, the SnO2 nanostructure on the FTO substrates can negate interfacial charge recombination effects due to the homo-junction relation (SnO2/F-doped SnO2). Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop an organized mesoporous SnO2 platform with a high porosity, larger pores, good interconnectivity, and large surface area to achieve a low-cost counter electrode with a high energy conversion performance.
Thus, in this work, we report low-cost and highly electrocatalytically active CoS nanoparticles on an organized mesoporous SnO2 (om-SnO2) layer as an alternative to the conventional Pt counter electrode in DSSCs. The key advantages of our suggested structure include: (1) the om-SnO2 platform has a well-organized structure, which is beneficial to the increased electron transport and reduced interfacial resistance; (2) the om-SnO2 platform has many coordinative interaction sites (i.e. hydroxyl groups), a feature that is essential for facilitating the nucleation and growth of CoS nanoparticles; and (3) the highly electrocatalytically active CoS nanoparticles, allowing for facile electrolytic reduction at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. The om-SnO2 platform was synthesized via a sol–gel process using a graft copolymer template. The as-prepared om-SnO2 platform then offered nucleation sites for CoS nanoparticles in the solvothermal step. The structural, morphological, chemical, and electrochemical properties of the CoS nanoparticles on om-SnO2 films were characterized in detail using field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. The resultant CoS on the om-SnO2 platform was used as a counter electrode in DSSCs, and their photovoltaic performances were characterized by current density–voltage (J–V) curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization of CoS on an om-SnO2 film
An effective method was developed to synthesize low-cost and highly electrocatalytically active CoS nanoparticles on an om-SnO2 layer as an alternative to conventional Pt counter electrodes in DSSCs. The overall concept and synthesis procedure are illustrated in Fig. 1. The crucial concept of our approach lies in the use of an om-SnO2 film with a high porosity, larger pores, and good interconnectivity as a platform. The first step involves the self-assembly of the PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer and SnCl2via a sol–gel reaction. The PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer functions as a structure-directing agent due to the well-defined, microphase-separated structure in the hydrophobic, glassy PVC main chains and the hydrophilic, rubbery POEM side chains.28a,29 The long molecular chains and lack of crystallinity of PVC-g-POEM also help to generate larger pores with a high porosity and promote the complete crystallization of SnO2 while maintaining structural integrity. The small, hydrophilic SnCl2 tin precursor provides selective interactions with the hydrophilic rubbery POEM side chains, and thus preferential confinement in the POEM domains of the PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer. The PVC-g-POEM/SnCl2 hybrid undergoes microphase separation into each nanoscale domain, in which the SnCl2 sol resides preferentially in the hydrophilic POEM domains separated from the hydrophobic PVC domains. Upon complete evaporation of the solvent and calcination at 450 °C, the POEM/SnCl2 hybrids form a SnO2 solid matrix with the mesopores regenerated from the isolated PVC domains. The CoS nanoparticles were in situ grown on the om-SnO2 platform at 180 °C for 12 h via a solverthermal method to improve the electrocatalytic activity of the counter electrode. During the solverthermal reaction, the om-SnO2 platform provides enhanced interaction sites and facilitates the formation of CoS nanoparticles. Moreover, the om-SnO2 platform would serve as a pathway to increase electron transport and reduce interfacial resistance. Thus, the CoS on om-SnO2 counter electrode is expected to possess greater electrocatalytic activity and achieve a better performance than conventional Pt-based counter electrodes.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the preparation process of the CoS nanoparticles on an om-SnO2 platform-based counter electrode. 
The structural evolution of the CoS on the om-SnO2/FTO counter electrode was observed using FE-SEM and compared with a CoS counter electrode without the om-SnO2 platform and a conventional Pt counter electrode, as shown in Fig. 2. A large, cobblestone-like structure with a high surface roughness was observed for the bare FTO glass substrate (Fig. 2a). The om-SnO2 platform exhibited good interconnectivity and high porosity without crack formation (Fig. 2b). This indicates that the sol–gel synthesis with the PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer self-assembly is an efficient approach for preparing a long-range, well-ordered om-SnO2 film with a pore diameter of approximately 30–40 nm, which would play a key role as a platform in enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of the counter electrode. The om-SnO2 platform has many coordinative interaction sites (i.e. hydroxyl groups) on the surface, which would facilitate the nucleation and crystal growth of CoS nanoparticles more effectively. This behavior was characterized using FT-IR spectroscopy and is discussed in the next section. According to a previous study, the hydroxyl (–OH) groups on the metal oxide surface allow for facile coordinative interactions with another metal precursor, resulting in facilitated nucleation and growth of the nanostructure.29 It is clear from the plan-view image in Fig. 2c that the om-SnO2 platform was completely and uniformly covered by the CoS nanoparticles with a size of approximately 25 nm. This size roughly matches the pore size of the om-SnO2 platform, indicating that the aggregation of CoS nanoparticles is controlled by the binding effect of the om-SnO2 platform. The cross-sectional FE-SEM image (Fig. 2d) reveals that a thin CoS nanoparticle film with a thickness of approximately 50 nm was homogeneously deposited on the om-SnO2 film, which is also supported by the TEM image (Fig. S1†). However, the nanoparticle density of the CoS counter electrode prepared without the om-SnO2 platform was much lower than that of the CoS on om-SnO2 system, as shown in Fig. 2e. This result demonstrates that the CoS on om-SnO2 counter electrode provides a better opportunity to achieve improved interfacial contact between the FTO glass substrate and CoS nanoparticle due to enhanced adhesion properties. Moreover, the interfacial resistance of the redox electrolyte/CoS nanoparticles may be improved due to the formation of a high density catalytic structure, which is beneficial for electron transfer. The conventional Pt-based counter electrode was also prepared through Pt acid thermal decomposition. As shown in Fig. 2f, the density of Pt nanoparticles on FTO glass was very low despite the high electrochemical catalytic activity, which may be due to its small particle size and the fact that it follows a completely different mechanism compared to CoS formation.

As mentioned in the previous FE-SEM analysis section, the numerous coordinative interaction sites (i.e. hydroxyl group) in the om-SnO2 platform provide exciting possibilities to facilitate the nucleation and growth of CoS nanoparticles. To illuminate this possibility, coordinative secondary bonding interactions between the om-SnO2 platform and the CoS precursor were investigated using FT-IR spectroscopy, as presented in Fig. 3a. Strong absorption bands were observed at around 3390 and 1640 cm−1 in the om-SnO2 platform, which can be attributed to –OH stretching vibrations and H–O–H bending vibrations on the metal oxide surface, respectively. Upon the introduction of CoS precursor to the om-SnO2 platform, the –OH stretching vibration at 3390 cm−1 was significantly shifted to 3147 cm−1. The peak shifts toward lower wavenumbers as a result of loosened interactions of hydroxyl groups due to coordinative interactions between the om-SnO2 platform and CoS precursor. It is therefore concluded that facilitated nucleation and crystal growth of CoS nanoparticles with a high density is due to the plentiful coordinative interaction sites (i.e. hydroxyl groups) present in the om-SnO2 platform.

The crystallographic structures of the om-SnO2 platform and CoS on om-SnO2 counter electrode were characterized by XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 3b. The average size of the crystallites was calculated using the Scherrer equation given below:D = k λ/β cosθ,where D is the average size of nanoparticle crystallites, k is a shape factor of the particles (0.89), λ is the wavelength of X-ray (λ = 1.5406 Å), β is the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak, and θ is half of Bragg's diffraction angle of the centroid of the peak in degrees.28a As revealed in the XRD patterns, the om-SnO2 platform exhibited several sharp peaks at 2θ values of 26.8°, 33.99°, 38.05°, 52.08°, and 54.66°, which correspond to the (110), (101), (200), (211), and (220) crystal planes of the rutile SnO2 phase, respectively (ICDD-JCPDS database, no. 41-1445). No peaks of other metal oxide species were observed in the XRD patterns, indicating a high purity of the om-SnO2 platform. On the other hand, upon the introduction of the CoS precursor on the om-SnO2 platform, some new peaks additionally appeared at 2θ values of 31.0°, 35.5°, 46.6°, and 54.0°, which correspond to the (100), (101), (102), and (110) planes of hexagonal CoS, respectively (ICDD-JCPDS database, No. 65-3418). The peak position and intensity of the rutile SnO2 phase in CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrode were not significantly different from those of the pristine om-SnO2 platform, indicating that the post-solverthermal treatment used for the CoS formation did not affect the crystallographic structure of the as-prepared om-SnO2 platform. By applying the Scherrer equation, the crystallite size of CoS was calculated to be approximately 22.3 nm, which agrees with the FE-SEM image (Fig. 2c). These XRD results were also supported by the Co 2p and S 2p XPS spectra for the CoS on om-SnO2, as shown in Fig. S2.† The main peak was observed with binding energies of 778.7 eV, corresponding to the binding energies of the Co 2p. The measured S 2p peaks were located at 161.5 and 162.2 eV with a split of 1.3 eV, which agree with the previously reported values.28e Therefore, this reveals that with the introduction of the CoS precursor on the om-SnO2 platform using the post-solvothermal process, the CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrode was successfully generated.
2.2 Photovoltaic performance of the CoS on om-SnO2 counter electrode
In order to further explain the variations of the photovoltaic parameters, the EIS technique was employed, and the interfacial resistances in the DSSCs were analyzed. The Nyquist plots and equivalent circuit diagram of the DSSCs are shown in Fig. 4a. The EIS Nyquist plots of the two devices (i.e. conventional Pt and CoS on om-SnO2 counter electrode systems) were measured from high (1 MHz) to low frequency (0.01 Hz) at the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of each device under one sun illumination. An equivalent circuit diagram was utilized to identify the ohmic series resistance of the substrate (RS), charge-transfer resistance (R1, R2, and WS), and the corresponding constant-phase angle element (CPE) in the DSSCs. In general, the ohmic serial resistance (RS) corresponds to the overall series resistance. The high frequency semicircle indicates the electrochemical impedance at the FTO substrate/counter electrode/redox electrolyte interface (R1), whereas the combined semicircle in the intermediate and low frequency regions indicates impedance by the photoanoode/dye/electrolyte (R2) interface related to the charge transport/recombination and Warburg diffusion process in the electrolyte (Ws), respectively.29 In this regard, we focused mostly on the analysis of the ohmic series resistance of the substrate (RS) and electrochemical impedance at the FTO substrate/counter electrode/redox electrolyte interface (R1) of our suggested system. Because the same photoanode and electrolyte were used for each cell, the differences of the ohmic series resistance and impedance at the FTO substrate/counter electrode/redox electrolyte interface are responsible for the different electrochemical properties of the DSSCs. As shown in Fig. 4a, the RS and R1 values of the CoS on om-SnO2 counter electrode-based cell were lower (9.1 and 5.4 Ω) than those of the conventional Pt counter electrode-based cell (14.4 and 6.8 Ω), respectively. This result indicates that the CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrode could reduce the interfacial resistance between the FTO substrate and CoS nanoparticles due to enhanced adhesion properties. Similar observation was previously reported regarding the influence of the functional SnO2 layer on the resistance properties in DSSCs.28d This indicates that the electron transport of the CoS on om-SnO2 counter electrode is greater than that on the conventional Pt counter electrode at the FTO substrate/counter electrode/redox electrolyte interface due to the higher density and larger active surface area of the catalytic structure, which improves the redox electrolyte reaction. As a result, the small observed RS and R1 values for our suggested system indicate that the electrochemical properties of the device are improved substantially when it is used as a counter electrode for DSSCs.

The scan rate was 50 mV s−1. 
The electrocatalytic properties of the CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrode with respect to the I−/I3− redox couple were investigated by conducting CV measurements. As shown in Fig. 4b, the CV curve of the CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrode system shows two pairs of I−/I3− redox peaks. The I−/I3− redox peaks (1, 2) at the more negative potential correspond to the reactions in eqn (1) and (2) and the I−/I3− redox peaks (3, 4) at the more positive potential correspond to the reactions in eqn (3) and (4).30 I3− + 2e− → 3I−: cathodic peak 1(1) 3I− → I3− + 2e−: cathodic peak 2(2) 3I2 + 2e− → 2I3−: anodic peak 1(3) 2I3− → 3I2 + 2e−: anodic peak 2(4)
Furthermore, the peak to peak separation (Epp), which is inversely proportional to the standard electrochemical rate constant of the I−/I3− redox reaction, is a significant factor in analyzing the catalytic activity of the counter electrode in DSSCs. The CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrode system has a smaller Epp (259 mV) than the conventional counter electrode (330 mV), indicating that the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the I−/I3− redox reaction in the former is higher than in the latter. It should also be noted that the CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrode system shows higher cathodic peak current densities than the conventional Pt counter electrode. This observation indicates that a higher electrocatalytic surface area can be achieved in our suggested system. On the other hand, it is well known that the Voc value in DSSCs lies between the potential of the photoanode and the I−/I3− redox equilibrium potential of the electrolyte. In this regard, based on the condition of the same photoanode, it is expected that the Voc value depends on the I−/I3− redox equilibrium potential of the counter electrode system.31 Therefore, the effect of CoS catalytic materials with the SnO2 platform on the photovoltaic performance will be intensively discussed in the following section.
To investigate the effect of the catalytic properties on the photovoltaic performance, the CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrode was subsequently assembled into DSSCs and compared with devices fabricated using a conventional Pt counter electrode. Compared to the DSSCs of a liquid-state electrolyte, a solid-state electrolyte exhibits some advantages such as superior long-term stability, cell flexibility, and being lightweight. Thus, ssDSSCs were also fabricated using poly(1-((4 ethenylphenyl)methyl)-3-butyl-imidazolium iodide) (PEBII) as the solid electrolyte without any additives such as iodine (I2) or an ionic liquid. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves measured under a simulated AM 1.5 G illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 5. The photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs are listed in Tables 1 and 2.

The ssDSSCs fabricated with the conventional Pt counter electrode resulted in a cell efficiency of 5.8%, whereas the efficiency of the CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrode DSSC reached 6.6%. This result corresponds to a 14% efficiency improvement relative to the conventional Pt cell and is one of the highest values obtained for Pt-free, N719 dye-based ssDSSCs.32–34 In particular, both the fill factor (FF) and Voc were found to increase for the device with the CoS on om-SnO2 counter electrode compared to those of the device with a conventional Pt counter electrode, which results in the enhancement of the photovoltaic performance in our suggested system. As previously demonstrated by the EIS analysis, the CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrode exhibited a densely packed catalytic structure and has an enhanced adhesion layer to the FTO substrate. This apparently led to an increase of the electron transport at the FTO substrate/counter electrode/redox electrolyte interface and a reduction of the interfacial resistance between the FTO substrate and CoS nanoparticles, resulting in a high FF. In addition, the Voc values suggest that CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrodes are more effective than conventional counter electrodes in catalyzing the reduction of triiodide to iodide. The improved electrocatalytic activity and electrocatalytic surface area in the counter electrode strongly influence the rapid release of I− species from the electrolytic reduction at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface, which agrees with the previously discussed CV analysis. The short circuit current density (Jsc) values were not significantly different between the conventional Pt and CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrode systems, indicating a small effect of the modified counter electrode on the light harvesting properties. The ssDSSCs fabricated using the CoS counter electrode without the om-SnO2 platform exhibited an energy conversion efficiency of 4.3%, indicating the importance of the om-SnO2 platform. It should be noted that the CoS on om-SnO2 counter electrode system showed significantly higher cathodic peak current densities than the CoS counter electrode, indicating the superior catalytic activities of the former (Fig. S3†). Furthermore, the EIS spectra reveal that the DSSC with CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrode had a lower resistance value than the DSSC without the om-SnO2 structure, which strongly supports the pivotal role of the om-SnO2 platform in enhancing electrochemical properties (Fig. S4†). On the other hand, the ssDSSCs fabricated with CoS on a dense SnO2 counter electrode showed an efficiency of only 4.0% at 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. S5.† This might result from a dense SnO2 platform with a less-interconnected particulate structure, which gives a negative impact on electron transport. Moreover, we observed that the dense SnO2 platform showed less-organized structures than the om-SnO2 platform (Fig. S6†). In addition, replacing the om-SnO2 platform with a functional SnO2 platform is expected to further improve the cell efficiency, which is currently under investigation in our lab. We also made an attempt to optimize the cell performance with the CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrode-based DSSCs with a conventional liquid electrolyte, which consists of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, I2, guanidinium thiocyanate, and 4-tert-butylpyridine in an acetonitrile–valeronitrile-mixed solvent. The device efficiency of the DSSCs using the liquid electrolyte reached 7.5% at 100 mW cm−2, which is again higher than that (6.9%) of the conventional Pt-based system and represents one of the highest values reported for Pt-free DSSCs to date.25,35–37 Therefore, the CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrode demonstrates a new way for improving the performance of low-cost and highly catalytic nanomaterial-based DSSCs.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we developed a facile and cost-effective solvothermal method to prepare a highly electrocatalytically active CoS on an om-SnO2 counter electrode for DSSC application. Using a sol–gel process with a PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer template, the om-SnO2 films were generated, which play key roles as platforms in coordinating to the CoS precursor. Compared to the conventional Pt counter electrode, the CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrode features excellent electron transport, reduced interfacial resistance, and facile electrolytic reduction in the DSSCs. Accordingly, high energy conversion efficiencies of 6.6% and 7.5% were achieved based on the CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrode, which correspond to improvements of 14% and 9% compared to conventional Pt-based ssDSSCs, respectively. Taking all of the mentioned properties into account, the highly electrocatalytically active CoS on om-SnO2 counter electrode as an alternative for Pt-based conventional counter electrodes is one of the most promising strategies for low-cost energy devices with a high energy conversion performance.

Tetrahydrofuran, N-methyl pyrrolidone, butanol, methanol, 2-propanol, chloroform, acetonitrile, diethylether, ethyl acetate, and valeronitrile were purchased from J.T. Baker. Deionized water (>18 MΩ m) was obtained using a water purification system made by the Millipore Corporation. Ruthenium dye (535-bisTBA, N719), TiO2 commercial colloidal paste (Ti-Nanoxide, D20), TiO2 commercial scattering paste (Ti-Nanoxide R/SP), and Surlyn (60 mm thick) were purchased from Solaronix (Switzerland). Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass substrates (TEC8, 8 ohms sq−1, 2.3 mm thick) were purchased from Pilkington, France. All chemicals and solvents were reagent grade and used as received. Unless noted otherwise, all experiments were carried out under ambient conditions in air.
4.2 Preparation of the om-SnO2 platform
The om-SnO2 platform was prepared by a sol–gel method using SnCl2 as a precursor and PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer as a structure-directing agent. The PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer consisting of a poly(vinyl chloride) backbone and poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) side chains were synthesized via atomic transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), according to a previously reported method.38 Then, the as-prepared PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer (0.05 g) was dissolved in THF (2.5 mL). After stirring for 2 h, SnCl2 (0.20 g) was then added to the graft copolymer solution. After aging for 15 min, additional deionized water (0.17 mL) was slowly added to the graft copolymer/tin precursor solution under vigorous stirring. Separately, the FTO glass substrates were rinsed with 2-propanol and chloroform each for 30 min and dried under nitrogen. Next, the solution was subsequently aged under mild stirring at room temperature for 12 h and spin-coated onto the FTO glass, baked at 50 °C for 30 min and subsequently calcined at 450 °C for 30 min in air.
4.3 Preparation of the CoS on om-SnO2 platform counter electrode
The CoS nanoparticle on the om-SnO2 platform-based counter electrode was prepared by slightly modifying a previously reported method.37 In brief, 0.001 mol of CoCl2·6H2O and 0.0022 mol of CH4N2S were dissolved in 50 mL of ethylene glycol under stirring for 1 hour. Then, the mixtures were transferred to the as-prepared mesoporous SnO2 platform-coated FTO glass substrates placed against the wall of a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 180 °C for 12 h. After the reaction, the CoS on om-SnO2 counter electrode was rinsed several times with ethanol and then calcined at 450 °C in air. In addition, the conventional counter electrode (Pt counter electrode) was used as a control group, according to previously reported procedures.38
4.4 Fabrication of the photoanode
After cleaning, the FTO glass substrate was treated with titanium(IV) bis(ethyl acetoacetato) diisopropoxide as a TiO2 block layer, followed by heating to 450 °C for 2 h, holding for 30 min, and cooling to 30 °C for 8 h. Next, TiO2 commercial colloidal paste was screened onto the FTO glass substrate using the doctor-blade method. These samples were dried at 50 °C for 1 h, annealed at 80 °C for 1 h, and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min to develop a nanocrystalline TiO2 film layer. Then, TiO2 commercial scattering paste was cast onto the nanocrystalline TiO2 layer and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. Then, the TiO2 film layer coated FTO glass substrate was sensitized with the 10−4 M ruthenium solution in ethanol at 50 °C for 2 h in a dark room. Finally, the dye-sensitized solar-cell photoanodes were immersed in absolute ethanol for 5 min to remove the non-adsorbed dye on the surface.
4.5 DSSC fabrication
DSSCs were fabricated using previously reported procedures.38–41 In brief, two types of electrolytes were employed for the fabrication of the DSSCs: (1) solid-state polymerized ionic liquid, i.e., poly(1-((4 ethenylphenyl)methyl)-3-butyl-imidazolium iodide) (PEBII), and (2) liquid electrolyte consisting of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, iodine (I2), guanidinium thiocyanate, and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile and valeronitrile. For the solid electrolyte DSSCs, an I2-free PEBII electrolyte solution in acetonitrile was directly cast onto the photoanode. First, a 2 wt% dilute PEBII electrolyte solution was cast onto a dye-adsorbed photoanode and evaporated very slowly for easy penetration of the electrolytes through the nanopores of the TiO2 layer. Next, a 10 wt% PEBII electrolyte solution was cast onto the photoanode and covered the counter electrode. Both electrodes were then superimposed and pressed between two glass plates to achieve slow evaporation of the solvent and a thin electrolyte layer. The cells were placed in a vacuum oven for one day for complete evaporation of the solvents and then sealed with an epoxy resin. In the case of the liquid system, the photoanode and counter electrode were sealed together in a sandwich configuration using a hot-melt 60 μm thick Surlyn film. The inter-electrode space was filled with an electrolyte by a vacuum back-filling method. The holes were sealed using a small piece of a hot-melt 60 μm thick Surlyn film and a microscope cover slip. The liquid electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (v/v, 85:15).
4.6 Characterization
The surface morphology of the CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrodes was evaluated by a field emission-scanning electron microscope (SUPRA 55VP, Carl Zeiss). FT-IR spectra of the samples were collected using an Excalibur Series FT-IR (DIGLAB Co.) instrument at frequencies ranging from 4000 cm−1 to 600 cm−1 at an ATR facility where 64 scans were signal-averaged at a resolution of 4 cm−1. Crystalline structures of CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrodes were analyzed using a X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku) 18 kw rotating anode X-ray generator equipped with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Data were collected with a step interval of 0.1° and a measuring time of 2 s per point in the 2 theta range of 5° to 60°. Surface compositions of the photoanodes were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a VG Scientific ESCALAB 220 spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical energy analyzer. A nonmonochromatized Al K X-ray source (h = 1486.6 eV) was operated at 12.5 kV and 16 mA under an analyzer chamber pressure of less than 10−6 Pa. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured by a potentiostat equipped with a frequency response analyzer (Compactstat, IVIUM Technologies) in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 0.1 MHz. The magnitude of the alternative signal was 0.2 V. The impedance parameters were determined by fitting the impedance spectra using the Z-view software. The impedance measurements were carried out at the open-circuit potential under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) light illumination. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using VSP (Bio-Logic) in a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell. CoS on the om-SnO2 counter electrode was used as the working electrode, whereas a platinum wire was used as the counter electrode and Ag/Ag+ (0.01 M AgNO3 + 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile) as the reference electrode. All potentials are shown versus 0.1 M Ag/Ag+ in the acetonitrile reference electrode. Photocurrent–voltage measurements were performed using a Keithley model 2400 source measure unit. A class A solar simulator (ABET Technologies, model 11000) equipped with a 1000 W xenon lamp (Oriel, 91193) was used as a light source, in which the light intensity was adjusted using a certified reference Si solar cells (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy System, Mono-Si + KG filter, Certificate no. C-ISE269) at a sunlight intensity of one (100 mW cm−2). During the photocurrent–voltage measurements, the DSSCs were covered with a black mask with an aperture to avoid additional light coming through the lateral space. The photoelectrochemical performances were calculated using the following equations: FF = Vmax·Jmax/Voc·Jsc(5) η = Vmax·Jmax/Pin·100 = Voc·Jsc·FF/Pin·100,(6)where Jsc is the short-circuit current density (mA cm−2), Voc is the open-circuit voltage (V), Pin is the incident light power, FF is the fill factor, η is the overall energy conversion efficiency, and Jmax (mA cm−2) and Vmax (V) are the current density and voltage in the J–V curve, respectively, at the point of maximum power output.
