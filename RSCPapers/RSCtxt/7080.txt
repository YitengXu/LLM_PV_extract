    , Accepted 16th September 2021First published on 17th September 2021AbstractNearly hexagonal two-dimensional NiCo layered dioxide oxides (NiCo-LDO) were successfully combined with CoWO4 to improve hydrogen production performance. Hexagonal 2D NiCo-LDO was fixed on the surface of CoWO4 to form NiCo-LDO/CoWO4(NCLW) with a p–n heterojunction structure. This structure contributes to the separation and transfer of photoinduced electrons (e−) and holes (h+), prolongs the carrier life, and improves the photocatalytic activity. Photocatalytic experiments showed that the hydrogen production of the p–n heterojunction NCLW under visible light irradiation for 5 h was 77.14 μmol, which was 3.4 times that of pure NiCo-LDO (22.41 μmol) and 40 times that of pure CoWO4 (1.93 μmol). Our discovery of NCLW in the photocatalytic decomposition of aquatic hydrogen will lead to new insights for the design and development of new photocatalytic materials based on layered double oxides (LDO).
1 Introduction
At present, due to the shortage of resources and the increasingly serious environmental problems, the exploration of new energy has become an important research area.1–8 Hydrogen energy stands out among many energy sources because H2 has a high heat value of combustion and is environmentally friendly.9–12 With the help of sunlight, photocatalytic decomposition of water to hydrogen is the best way to produce hydrogen.13–16 However, the utilization rate of solar energy is low at present; therefore, it is important to find a low-cost, easy-to-prepare, pollution-free catalyst.17–19
Transition metal oxides, especially cobalt–nickel oxide composites, are the best choice for photocatalysts because of their excellent electrochemical properties. In recent years, nickel–cobalt bimetallic oxide functional nanomaterials have attracted extensive attention because of their excellent chemical properties and good stability.20–22 Moreover, the layered structure and large specific surface area of Co2NiO4 are conducive to charge transfer, thus improving the photocatalytic activity.23 Co2NiO4 can further improve its electrochemical performance. It prolongs the electron transfer path and reduces charge transfer resistance, among other advantages.24
In recent years, binary metal tungstate salts, such as CoWO425–29 and NiWO4,30 have been used as catalysts for photocatalytic decomposition of aquatic hydrogen due to their multiple oxidation states31–33 as well as their simple preparation, low cost, environmental protection and lower toxicity. As a p-type semiconductor catalyst, CoWO4 has the advantages of a narrow band gap, easy photoexcitation, and good electrochemical performance.34
In this study, we prepared the composite catalyst NCLW by an in situ deposition method, and we further proved the effective integration of NiCo-LDO and CoWO4. In addition, NCLW with a p–n heterojunction structure could accelerate the transfer of e− and h+, and the hydrogen production of NCLW-4 was 77.14 μmol within 5 h, which is about 3.4 times and 40 times that of NiCo-LDO (22.41 μmol) and CoWO4 (1.93 μmol), respectively. Our work on NCLW decomposition of water for hydrogen evolution has brought new insights to the discovery of the design and development of highly efficient NiCo-LDO-based photocatalysts.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
All reagents were analytical grade in this work: cobalt–nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O), sodium tungstate dihydrate (Na2WO4·2H2O), cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), triethanolamine (TEOA), and eosin Y (EY, C20H6Br4Na2O5).
2.2 Synthesis of the NiCo-LDO catalyst
5 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 5 mmol NiCl2·6H2O were dissolved in 60 mL deionized water. The solution was stirred until the solids were fully dissolved. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 11 with NaOH solution with a concentration of 1 mol L−1 and stirred on a magnetic stirrer for 1 h; then, the solution was transferred to a high-pressure reaction kettle lined with Teflon for 12 h at 180 °C. The reaction product was washed with ethanol and water several times, then dried at 60 °C. After that, the catalysts were annealed at 600 °C for 4 h under air atmosphere with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1.
2.3 Synthesis of CoWO4 catalyst
In a typical experiment, the first 3 mmol of CoCl2·6H2O was dissolved in 60 mL distilled water. Secondly, 3 mmol of Na2WO4·2H2O solution was added to the above solution, and it was vigorously stirred for 1 h. Last, the suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 12 h. The precipitate was washed with water and ethanol several times and then dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain the CoWO4 nanocomposite.
2.4 Synthesis of NiCo-LDO/CoWO4 catalyst
The composite catalyst NiCo-LDO/CoWO4 was prepared by in situ deposition. First, 100 mg of the prepared NiCo-LDO was dissolved in 60 mL deionized water, and the mixture was stirred. Then, the prepared CoWO4 was added. After ultrasonic treatment for 0.5 h and stirring for 0.5 h, the product was completely dissolved, washed with water and ethanol several times, and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h; the product was named NCLW. The preparation process of the composite catalyst NCLW is shown in Scheme 1.

The composite catalysts named NCLW-1, NCLW-2, NCLW-3, NCLW-4 and NCLW-5 were obtained by adding 20 mg, 25 mg, 30 mg, 35 mg and 40 mg CoWO4, respectively.
2.5 Characterizations
The structures of the as-prepared catalysts were studied using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku SmartLab) at 10° min−1. The morphologies of NiCo-LDO, CoWO4, and NCLW were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-6701F.JEOL). High low amplification TEM (HRTEM) was used to scan the fabric with a JEOL JEM-2100 field emission TEM. The crystal lattice, atomic ratio and ray power spectrum (EDX) were obtained. The compositions and valences of the elements were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi). The N2 absorption and desorption curves were measured by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, ASAP 2020M) method at 77 K. The photoluminescence (PL) of NiCo-LDO, CoWO4, and NCLW was analyzed by a fluorescence spectrometer (FLUOROMAX-4). UV-vis DRS was analyzed by a UV-2550 (Shimadzu) spectrometer with BaSO4 as a reference.
Electrochemical characterization was conducted on a three-electrode electrochemical workstation (Versa Stat 4-400, Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc.). The working electrode was prepared by dispersing 0.01 g of sample and 1 mg of PVDF into 0.1 mL ethanol; the mixture was stirred, coated on ITO conductive glass (1 cm2), and dried at room temperature. Ag/AgCl served as the reference electrode, and Na2SO4 (0.2 mol L−1) was used as the electrolyte.
2.6 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
The photocatalytic reaction was carried through a circulation system (5 W LED, λ ≥ 420 nm, Perfect Light, PCX50B Discover) in a 62 cm2 closed quartz bottle, and the hydrogen production was monitored online using a gas chromatograph (Ruili SP-2100, TCD, 13× column, N2 carrier). The 10 mg sample was dissolved with 22 mg eosin (EY) in 30 mL of 10% (v/v) triethanolamine solution (TEOA). Before illumination, ultrasonic dispersion was performed for 30 min, followed by vacuum treatment with N2 to eliminate the influence of air. In the whole process of photocatalysis, the mixed liquid was stirred strongly to obtain good dispersibility of the photocatalyst in the solution. The sample gas was extracted into the chromatograph every 1 h for analysis.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 SEM and TEM analysis
The microstructures and morphologies of NiCo-LDO, CoWO4 and NCLW-4 were observed by SEM and TEM. The SEM image of pure NiCo-LDO is shown in Fig. 1(a). It was obvious that NiCo-LDO presented an approximate hexagonal two-dimensional nanosheet morphology with a size of about 0.5 μm. It could be seen from the SEM of CoWO4 that it presented an irregular block morphology that was about 5 μm in size (Fig. 1(b)). The SEM image of the composite catalyst NCLW-4 is shown in Fig. 1(c), and it can be clearly observed that the small NiCo-LDO nanosheets are anchored on the large bulk CoWO4. NCLW-4 transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 1(d)) further showed that the NiCo-LDO nanosheets were successfully bonded to CoWO4. As can be seen from the HRTEM image (Fig. 1(d)), the spacing of the lattice fringes was 0.16 nm, corresponding to the (422) crystal plane of NiCo-LDO; 0.36 nm, corresponding to the (011) crystal plane of CoWO4; and 0.46 nm, corresponding to the (001) crystal plane of CoWO4. The element mapping diagram, as shown in Fig. 1(f), and the EDS energy spectrum, as shown in Fig. 1(g), confirmed the coexistence of Ni, Co, O and W elements in the NCLW-4 sample, and these elements were uniformly distributed.

3.2 XRD analysis
In order to analyze the crystal phase structures of the materials, we carried out XRD tests on the prepared catalysts. The XRD patterns of the NiCo-LDO, CoWO4 and NCLW-4 composite catalysts are shown in Fig. 2(a). It can be seen from the XRD pattern of NiCo-LDO that the diffraction peaks at 31.19°, 36.78°, 44.67°, 58.97° and 64.74° correspond to the (220), (311), (400), (511) and (311) crystal planes of cubic Co2NiO4 (PDF#2-1074), respectively. Similarly, from the XRD pattern of CoWO4, it can be seen that the diffraction peaks located at 19.18°, 23.85°, 24.86°, 30.82°, 36.41°, 41.36° and 54.11° correspond to the (001), (10), (011), (11), (200), (21) and (22) crystal planes of monoclinic CoWO4 (PDF#15-867), respectively. The (200) and (311) crystal planes of the catalyst were amplified. Using the (511) crystal plane of NiCo-LDO and (11) crystal plane of CoWO4, the average particle sizes of NiCo-LDO and CoWO4 were calculated as 1.34 nm and 7.48 nm, respectively, according to Scheller's equation.35 The diffraction peaks of NiCo-LDO and CoWO4 were also retained in the composite catalyst (Fig. 2(b)), indicating the successful combination of NiCo-LDO and CoWO4 (Fig. 2(c)). According to the crystal plane index a = b = c = 8.128 of NiCo-LDO, NiCo-LDO was calculated to be cubic, and the unit cell coordination unit was 8 (Fig. 2(d)). The crystal plane parameters of CoWO4, a = 4.9478, b = 5.6827, and c = 4.6694, were calculated to show that CoWO4 is monoclinic, and its unit cell coordination unit is 2.

3.3 XPS analysis
XPS was used to measure the surface chemical states of the NiCo-LDO, CoWO4 and NCLW-4 samples. The p–n heterojunction NCLW-4 contained Co, Ni, W, O and other elements, as shown in Fig. 3(a), which was consistent with the EDS results. The high-resolution spectra of Co 2p elements contained in NiCo-LDO, CoWO4 and NCLW-4 are shown in Fig. 3(b). The two peaks at 795.5 eV and 779.9 eV correspond to Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, respectively, while the two peaks at 802.9 eV and 786.2 eV correspond to Co2+ in CoWO4. However, Co2+ and Co3+ were present in NiCO-LDO and NCLW-4. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ni 2p is shown in Fig. 3(c). The binding energies of 872.6 eV and 855.5 eV correspond to Ni2+; the binding energies of 871.1 eV and 853.8 eV correspond to Ni3+; and the satellite peaks are at 879.6 eV and 861.0 eV. The high resolution XPS pattern of W 4f (Fig. 3(d)) showed two peaks at 37.0 eV and 34.9 eV, which belong to W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2, corresponding to W4+ in CoWO4 and NCLW-4, respectively. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s is shown in Fig. 3(e). The peak at the 531.0 eV binding energy belongs to O in the H2O absorbed on the surface, and the peak at the 529.3 eV binding energy belongs to the O–M (M = Ni, Co) bond. In addition, it was observed that the diffraction peaks of Co 2p and O 1s in the p–n heterojunction of NCLW-4 tended to shift towards the direction of low binding energy, indicating that there was a strong interaction between NiCo-LDO and CoWO4, rather than simple surface loading.

3.4 BET analysis
The specific surface areas and pore size distributions of NiCo-LDO, CoWO4 and NCLW-4 were determined by the N2 adsorption–desorption method. The composite NCLW-4 had higher adsorption capacity than NiCo-LDO and CoWO4 (Fig. 4(a)), indicating that the combination of NiCo-LDO and CoWO4 further enhanced the BET area and pore volume of the catalyst. Therefore, to further analyze the pore structure changes of the materials, the pore size distribution of the materials was measured (Fig. 4(b)). The distribution of NCLW-4 in the range of 10–40 nm was wider than that of NiCo-LDO and CoWO4. The specific surface areas, pore volumes and pore sizes of the NiCo-LDO, CoWO4 and NCLW-4 catalysts are shown in Table 1. A large specific surface area and pore volume may promote mass transfer, which is favorable for photocatalytic reaction.

3.5 Photocatalytic H2 evolution performance
To study the hydrogen production activity of the samples, 10 vol% TEOA was used as a sacrificial agent to test the hydrogen evolution of the prepared samples under the irradiation of 5 W LED lamps. The hydrogen evolution of pure NiCo-LDO and pure CoWO4 under 5 h of light conditions was very low, 22.41 μmol and 1.93 μmol, respectively (Fig. 5(a)). With the increase of the CoWO4 load, the hydrogen yield of the prepared composite catalyst increased obviously, and it reached the maximum when the load was 35 mg. Meanwhile, the hydrogen production of the composite catalyst NCLW-4 could reach up to 77.14 μmol, which was about 3.4 times and 40 times that of pure NiCo-LDO and CoWO4, respectively. The results showed that the combination of NiCo-LDO with CoWO4 could provide more active sites and improve the activity of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, excessive CoWO4 will overshadow the active sites of NiCo-LDO and decrease hydrogen production.
 Fig. 5  (a) H2 evolution of NiCo-LDO, CoWO4, NCLW-1, NCLW-2, NCLW-3, NCLW-4, NCLW-5; (b) H2 evolution rates of NCLW-4 with different pH TEOA–H2O solutions; (c) H2 production of NCLW-4 with different weights of EY; (d) stability testing; (e) XRD patterns of NCLW-4 before and after the reaction; (f) AQYs of NCLW-4 under different wavelengths of illumination. 
Next, we used the composite catalyst NCLW-4 with the optimal CoWO4 load to optimize the hydrogen production conditions, including the pH of the sacrificial agent TEOA (Fig. 5(b)) and the addition amount of sensitizer EY (Fig. 5(c)). The pH of the sacrifice agent will affect the concentration of electrons in the solution, affect the redox reaction, and then affect the hydrogen evolution of the samples. It was found that the hydrogen production of the NCLW-4 catalyst was 45.56 μmol, 77.14 μmol, 177.46 μmol, 193.94 μmol and 70.24 μmol when the sacrificial agent pH was 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, respectively. It could be seen that the best sacrificial agent pH for hydrogen evolution of NCLW-4 was 11. The sensitizer could absorb photons under the condition of light and promote the photocatalytic reaction. Then, when the pH of the sacrificial agent was 11, the amount of the sensitizer EY was changed to 16 mg, 18 mg, 20 mg, 22 mg and 24 mg, respectively. When 22 mg of the sensitizer EY was added, the hydrogen evolution effect of this system was the best. Similarly, excessive EY can shield the active sites of the catalyst, thus inhibiting the hydrogen production activity of the catalyst.
The stability of a catalyst is an essential factor to evaluate its performance; therefore, we carried out the illumination hydrogen production cycle test for 20 h (H2 was replaced out of the system with N2 every 5 h) (Fig. 5(d)), and XRD tests were performed on the catalyst before and after the hydrogen production reaction (Fig. 5(e)). It could be observed that the hydrogen production decreased slightly after 10 h of light exposure; therefore, 6 mg of EY was added to the hydrogen production system after 10 h of light exposure, so that hydrogen production decreased slightly at the end of this cycle compared with the previous 5 h. After 20 h of light exposure, the hydrogen production continued to decrease, but the range of change was not very large. Therefore, we speculated that the reason for the above phenomenon is that the sensitizer EY was degraded under the condition of light, and the NCLW-4 itself had favorable stability. The XRD patterns of the catalysts before and after hydrogen production were observed to be consistent, indicating that the crystal phase structure of the catalyst did not change; this further indicated that the catalyst had good stability. The AQY of the p–n heterojunction NCLW-4 in the EY system was studied under different light conditions, as shown in Fig. 5(f). The reaction system has the highest AQY at 520 nm wavelength, which is 1.71%.
3.6 Photoluminescence analysis
The recombination of photogenerated e− and h+ is one of the problems that limit photocatalytic reactions. Fluorescence is an effective method to characterize the separation of photogenerated e− from h+.36 As shown in Fig. 6(a), the EY solution showed the strongest fluorescence signal; after the addition of catalyst, the fluorescence signal showed an obvious downward trend, and EY-NCLW-4 showed the lowest fluorescence response. This was due to the p–n heterojunction formed by NiCo-LDO and CoWO4, which enabled the rapid transfer of e− and h+, thus reducing the recombination rate. In order to obtain more carrier information, we further studied the time-resolved PL (Fig. 6(b)), and concluded that the p–n heterojunction NCLW-4 had a longer fluorescence lifetime.

3.7 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra
The light absorption and band gap of the catalyst were studied by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. As can be seen from Fig. 7(a) and (b), NiCo-LDO had the strongest light absorption in the wavelength range of 250–800 nm. CoWO4 has the highest absorbance at 250–400 nm. The resulting composite catalyst NCLW-4 has the best light absorption performance, which is consistent with the results of hydrogen production of the catalyst, indicating that the combination of NICO-LDO and CoWO4 can improve photocatalytic activity. Fig. 7(b) and (c) was calculated by the formula αhν = A(hν − Eg)37 (where α represents the absorption intensity and hν represents the photon energy). It can be seen that the band gaps of the bimetallic oxides NiCo-LDO and CoWO4 were 1.63 eV and 2.71 eV, respectively.

3.8 Photoelectrochemical properties
To investigate the separation and transfer mechanism of the photogenerated carriers, we performed transient photocurrent response tests (Fig. 8(a)), linear volatility curves (Fig. 8(b)) and electrochemical impedance tests (Fig. 8(c)) on the catalysts. The composite catalyst NCLW-4 exhibits the strongest photocurrent response and the smallest overpotential, and the radius of its Nernst curve is the smallest. These phenomena indicate that the composite catalyst NCLW-4 has a higher current density, which makes it difficult for electrons and holes to recombine. The smallest overpotential indicates stronger reducibility; the small radius of the Nernst curve means that the resistance of the electron in the transfer process is small, and the small resistance speeds the transfer of electrons.

Mott–Schottky diagrams of NiCo-LDO and CoWO4 are shown in Fig. 8(d). The slope of the curve can reflect the type of semiconductor. The positive slope of the curve of NiCo-LDO indicates that NiCo-LDO is an n-type semiconductor, while CoWO4 is a p-type semiconductor. Through linear fitting, the flat band potentials (Efb) of NiCo-LDO and CoWO4 were −0.51 eV and 1.26 eV, respectively. In general, the conduct-band position (ECB) of an n-type semiconductor is about minus 0.1–0.2 eV from the value of Efb, and the valence band position (EVB) of the p-type semiconductor is about 0.1–0.2 eV than the Efb.34 Therefore, the ECB of NiCo-LDO was approximately −0.71 eV, and the EVB of CoWO4 was approximately 1.46 eV. According to the ultraviolet test, the band gaps Eg of NiCo-LDO and CoWO4 were 1.63 eV and 2.71 eV, respectively. According to the formula ECB = EVB − Eg,38 we calculated that the EVB of NiCo-LDO was about 0.92 eV and that of CoWO4 was about −1.25 eV. The EVB, Eg and ECB of NiCo-LDO and CoWO4 are shown in Table 2.

3.9 Photocatalytic mechanism
From the above characterization analysis results, the band distributions of NiCo-LDO and CoWO4 are shown in Fig. 9(a). According to previous reports,39,40 the Fermi level is close to the valence band (VB) for n-type NiCo-LDO and to the conduction band (CB) for p-type CoWO4. As shown in Fig. 9(b), when n-type NiCo-LDO and p-type CoWO4 combine to form a heterojunction, an internal electric field will be formed. At the Fermi energy level, equilibrium is achieved, which causes electrons to flow from p-type CoWO4 to n-type NiCo-LDO and holes to flow from n-type NiCo-LDO to p-type CoWO4. Under light irradiation, NiCo-LDO and CoWO4 are excited to form photogenerated e− and h+. The excited e− in the p-type CoWO4 CB move to the n-type NiCo-LDO conduction band, while the photogenerated h+ remain in the VB of p-type CoWO4. At the same time, under the light condition, the EY molecule is excited into the unstable EY1*, and the unstable EY1* is then transformed into EY3*. Under the action of TEOA, EY3* is reduced to EY−˙, and EY−˙ loses e− and ends up as an EY molecule. In the NCLW photocatalytic system, electrons participate in the reduction reaction to produce hydrogen, and the h+ are consumed by TEOA. In the p–n heterojunction NCLW, the internal electric field improves the migration rate and separation rate of photogenerated e− and h+. The catalytic efficiency of the p–n heterojunction NCLW in the photocatalytic decomposition of aquatic hydrogen can be improved.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a 2D NiCo-LDO photocatalyst was prepared by a hydrothermal method and calcination method, and it was proved that the combination of 2D NiCo-LDO and CoWO4 effectively improved the photocatalytic decomposition performance of aquatic hydrogen. Photocatalytic experiments showed that NCLW was better than pure 2D NiCo-LDO and pure CoWO4 in the decomposition of aquatic hydrogen under visible light irradiation, and it had good stability. From the perspective of mechanism analysis, the formed p–n heterojunction NCLW was beneficial to the photoinduced separation and transfer of e− and h+, which prolonged the life of the charge carriers and thus improved the photocatalytic activity. Also, through BET analysis, we found that NCLW had a larger specific surface area than pure NiCo-LDO and pure CoWO4; this could provide more active sites, thus improving the hydrogen evolution activity. Our discovery of the NCLW photocatalytic decomposition of aquatic hydrogen will lead to new insights for the design and development of highly efficient photocatalysts based on bimetallic oxides.
