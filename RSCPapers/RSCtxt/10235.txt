    , Accepted 9th July 2021First published on 30th July 2021AbstractFormamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)-based perovskites possess high light absorption and long diffusion lengths, making them strong candidates for highly efficient solar cells. However, despite these properties, primary intrinsic defects in FAPbI3 (i.e. iodine vacancy) induce strong electron localisation and become deep traps and recombination centres upon photoexcitation. Consequently, the carrier lifetime is significantly reduced and the superior properties are not fully utilised. Therefore, the manipulation of intrinsic defects has become a critical issue for realising highly efficient solar cells. Herein, formamidine disulfide dihydrochloride (FASCl) is used because the FAS2+ ion is a strong oxidant or electron scavenger. Substitution of the FAS2+ ion for the FA+ ion makes the iodine vacancy lose the strongly localised electrons and removes the deep traps. The incorporation of FASCl induces the formation of intermediate phases with a perovskite precursor, which can effectively stabilise the black α-phase FAPbI3 and retard the crystallisation rate, leading to compact full-coverage perovskite layers with high crystallinity and a large grain size. As a result, the optimal unit device (0.14 cm2) exhibits a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.11%, a stabilised power output (SPO) of 22.83%, a low voltage deficit of 0.343 V, and a notable fill factor of 83.4%. Without encapsulation, the device retains ∼92.5% and ∼91.7% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of either heating at 85 °C (thermal) or 50% relative humidity atmospheric testing, respectively. Moreover, the perovskite solar modules (PSMs) achieve PCE values of 20.75% (with a notable fill factor of 78.5%) and 17.44% for the active areas of 23.27 and 59.33 cm2, respectively.

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained much attention recently due to their ever-increasing solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency (PCE), low cost, and convenient solution fabrication processes. As a promising and competitive candidate for future photovoltaic devices, the cubic α-phase of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) has emerged as one of the most appealing materials due to its excellent high light absorption and long diffusion length. However, the intrinsic defects (i.e. iodine vacancy) accompanied by strong electron localisation become recombination centers and deteriorate the photovoltaic properties. Consequently, the prevention of electron localization in defects is of critical importance for high-efficiency PSCs and industrial-scale perovskite solar modules (PSMs). Here, we investigated an efficient strategy to prevent electron localisation in the iodine vacancy by incorporating an electron scavenger. This makes the iodine vacancy lose the strongly localised electrons and removes the deep traps owing to the strong reduction tendency. This also stabilises the α-phase FAPbI3 and retards the crystallization rate, leading to compact full-coverage perovskite layers with high crystallinity and a large grain size. We found that the perovskite films deposited on 25.74 cm2 and 65.22 cm2 substrates exhibit superior uniformity and excellent photovoltaic properties. As a result, we achieved a remarkable performance of 18.76% and 15.87%, respectively.

Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown extremely rapid progress in laboratory-scale device performance after demonstrating outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of over 25% for small-area devices. However, the most urgent issue that remains to be solved is whether or not high-efficiency laboratory-cell technology can be translated to industrial-scale high-throughput production with minimal efficiency loss.1–4 Although laboratory-scale PSCs that achieve high PCE values are comparable to commercial silicon solar cells, the performance (i.e. efficiency and stability) of perovskite solar modules (PSMs) is still far inferior to that of commercial photovoltaic products.5,6 In addition, perovskite light absorbers also play a significant role in the commercialised fabrication of uniform, pinhole-free, and low-defect large-area PSMs. Among the reported perovskite materials, formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) is widely used because of its high absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length, and ideal band gap (1.45–1.51 eV), which is close to the optimum value of a single-junction solar cell.7,8 However, pure FAPbI3-based perovskite undergoes phase degradation of the photoactive black phase α-FAPbI3 to the wide-band-gap (∼2.43 eV) non-perovskite yellow δ-phase. This spontaneous phase transition deteriorates the photovoltaic performance and long-term stability.9,10 Considering the performance and operating stability of FA-based PSCs, Grätzel et al. showed that substituting some FA+ species with MA+ or Cs+ can inhibit this phase transformation.11 Lee et al. reported the addition of two-dimensional (2D) phenylethylammonium lead iodide into the precursor solution to fabricate phase-pure FAPbI3 with high optoelectronic quality and stability.12 Most recently, Kim et al. reported a strain-relaxation strategy with substituted cesium (Cs) and methylenediammonium (MDA) cations in the FA sites of FAPbI3, which the increased carrier lifetime and reduced defect concentrations.3
However, FAPbI3 materials have various intrinsic point defects that cause shallow or deep trap states in the forbidden band. These deep trap sites are considered one of the primary reasons for the fast charge-recombination rate and short carrier diffusion length of FAPbI3, and the consequent deterioration of the PCE.13,14 Among the intrinsic defects, the FA cation vacancy (VFA), the Pb ion vacancy (VPb), and the FA interstitial (FAI) have been reported to generate shallow traps near the valence band maximum (VBM) or the conduction band minimum (CBM).15–17 On the contrary, the iodine vacancy (VI) becomes a deep trap upon exposure to light, followed by the generation of photocarriers, although it is a shallow trap in the dark state.18–21 In the photoexcited state, two electrons, one each from VI and the photocarrier, are strongly localised on the iodine vacancy located between two Pb ions, whereas an extra electron from the iodine vacancy is localised on the iodine vacancy of the shallow trap in the dark state. The strong localisation of two electrons accompanied by Pb dimerisation leads to a deep hole trap at an iodine vacancy site of a negatively charged state VI−. The resulting defect complex, Pb–VI−–Pb, becomes a recombination centre and significantly decreases the carrier lifetime to less than 1/50 compared with that of perovskite materials without VI− states.20 Consequently, the PCE and the long-term stability deteriorate significantly. Therefore, the elimination of Pb–VI−–Pb has become a critical issue in enhancing the performance of FAPbI3-based solar cells. Although many studies have reported improvements in solar cell performance by surface passivation,22,23 solvent engineering,24–26 processing additives,27–29 interface engineering,30–32 and pre-synthesized high-quality crystalline perovskite powder,33,34 there have been few attempts at manipulating the intrinsic defects to eliminate the strong electron localisation and deep trap sites.
In this work, we report on an efficient strategy to prevent charge localisation in the iodine vacancy by the addition of formamidine disulfide dihydrochloride (FASCl). The FAS2+ ion in FASCl has been reported as a strong oxidant for gold dissociation, causing the gold to lose electrons.35,36 FAS2+ ions are used to scavenge the extra electrons and prevent strong electron localisation on the iodine vacancy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the incorporation of FASCl in FAPbI3 eliminates deep traps owing to a strong reduction tendency. The large FAS2+ ion is incorporated into the octahedral structure by substituting two adjacent FA+ ions. FAS2+ strongly attracts electrons from the iodine vacancy, changes the state of the iodine vacancy from a negatively charged state to a positively charged state, prevents the formation of the defect complex Pb–VI−–Pb, and consequently eliminates the deep traps. Moreover, the addition of FASCl results in the formation of intermediate phases of x[FAS2+]·2[PbI2Clx]x−, which effectively retard the nucleation and crystal growth rate of the perovskite, consequently improving the quality of the perovskite film.37 These intermediate phases also enable the stabilisation of α-FAPbI3 and suppress the formation of the non-perovskite δ-phase. As a result, the target PSCs with 4 mol% FASCl reach a maximum PCE of 23.11% at the laboratory-scale size of 0.14 cm2 and 20.75% for PSMs with an active area of 23.27 cm2. The PSMs exhibit excellent operational stability, giving a stabilised PCE of 19.8% for 2000 s tracking under continuous light soaking in ambient air (a relative humidity controlled at ∼5–10%). Notably, an optimal module with eight sub-cells shows an excellent fill factor (FF) of around 78.5% without any Voc loss from the laboratory-scale upscaled to the module. Furthermore, a maximum PCE of 17.44% is achieved with an active area of 59.35 cm2.
Results and discussion
First, the process for incorporating the FASCl additive into the octahedral structure of FAPbI3 was investigated based on a DFT study. Fig. 1a shows the schematic structures of the FA+ and FAS2+ ions, where FASCl consists of the FAS2+ ion and two Cl− ions. The length of FAS2+ is ∼742 pm, which is 2.7 times higher than that of the FA+ ion (271 pm). As shown in Fig. 1b, the FAPbI3 unit cell lattice parameter is 6.36 Å.38 Given the size and charge of FAS2+ and FA+, it is expected that the FAS2+ ion substitutes into two adjacent FA+ ions rather than only one FA+ ion (Fig. 1c). In the case of FA0.926FAS0.037PbI3, where only FAS2+ is doped without co-doping of Cl−, it has a higher formation energy (>220 meV) than pristine FAPbI3 (114 meV; Fig. S3, ESI†). However, the formation energy is decreased when the Cl− ion is co-doped into FAPbI3 with FAS2+. The formation energy of FA0.926FAS0.037PbI2.963Cl0.037 co-doped with one Cl− is ∼180 meV, which further decreases to 140 meV in FA0.926FAS0.037PbI2.926Cl0.074 co-doped with two Cl− ions (Fig. S4, ESI†). The formation-energy difference between FA0.926FAS0.037PbI2.926Cl0.074 and pristine FAPbI3 is only 26 meV, which is close to the room-temperature energy. Compared with I− ions, Cl− ions have a smaller ionic radius, which does not induce the distortion of the PbI2 octahedral structures. This makes it favourable for FAS2+ to substitute two neighbouring FA ions. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†), the decreased formation energy does not depend on the configuration of co-doped Cl− and FAS2+. The formation-energy difference with respect to their configuration is less than ∼10 meV since the Cl− ions are easily incorporated into the structure regardless of their positions. Therefore, the FAS2+ ions can be incorporated into FAPbI3 by substituting two neighbouring FA ions rather than forming a 2D Dion–Jacobson phase.39

Spheres with grey, violet, light green, yellow, brown, light grey, and light pink shading represent Pb, I, Cl, S, C, N, and H, respectively. 
As discussed, defect states resulting in unintentional charge-carrier recombination are one of the main reasons for the degradation of the solar cell efficiency. Fig. 2a–c show schematic diagrams of how the iodine vacancy (VI) introduces the recombination centre into the pristine FAPbI3; Fig. 2d and e show the corresponding density of states (DOS) for each case. For pristine FAPbI3 with a perfect crystal, there are no traps in the band gap (Fig. 2a and d). However, the VI introduces defect states below the CBM and the electron generated by VI itself fills this state (Fig. 2b and e). If extra electrons are generated upon light illumination, the electrons fill the VI state and the iodine vacancy becomes a negatively charged state (VI−) by strong electron localisation. Simultaneously, two Pb ions adjacent to the VI− move toward each other forming a defect complex, Pb–VI−–Pb, and Pb–I dangling bonds on the opposite sides from the VI− site. Owing to strong electron localisation on the iodine vacancy site and consequent iodine dangling bonds, deep hole traps associated with the negatively charged VI− are generated in the forbidden band of FAPbI3. (Fig. 2c and f) According to previous reports, this is consistent with other halide perovskites possessing the VI− site.18,20,21,40 This deep hole trap acts as a recombination centre, dramatically reducing the carrier lifetime compared with perovskites without electron localisation in the iodine vacancy site.20,21

Inset figures in (d–f) and (j–l) represent the wave functions of selected states in real space. 
However, the incorporation of FAS2+ cations eliminates the defect complex by scavenging extra electrons from the iodine vacancy and photoexcitation. Consequently, the iodine vacancy becomes positively charged and the formation of deep traps or recombination centres is effectively suppressed. Fig. 2g–i display schematics on how doped FAS2+ ions prevent electron localisation in the iodine vacancy site; Fig. 2j–l show the DOS of the corresponding structures. As shown in Fig. 2g and j, the doped FAS2+ offers an empty state (the FAS state) in the band gap. The energy level of this state is lower than that of the VI state, as expected from the strong oxidant nature of the FAS2+ ion,35,36 and thus the electron generated by VI fills the FAS state rather than the VI state, inducing the ionisation of VI into the positively charged state (VI+; Fig. 2h and k). The VI+ state is maintained when an extra electron is added by light illumination since the electron prefers to fill the FAS state rather than the VI state. Consequently, there exist no localised electrons in the iodine vacancy site under the light illumination conditions and the deep traps are eliminated from the band gap as shown in Fig. 2i and l. In addition, Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows that the FAS2+ dopant is capable of suppressing charge localisation at the iodine vacancy site regardless of the relative position between FAS2+ and the VI site in FAPbI3. However, the FAS state itself is positioned at the deep level (Fig. 2j) and may act as the recombination centre. Under a high doping concentration of FASCl, the charge-carrier recombination rate would be facilitated. Hence, optimisation of the doping concentration is crucial for retarding charge recombination.
To confirm the effect of FASCl additives, the surface morphologies of the different composition films manufactured with FAPbI3 (denoted as pristine), (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 (denoted as FAMA, control) and x mol% (x = 0, 2, 4, and 6) FASCl-doped FAPbI3 perovskite films were evaluated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). As depicted in Fig. 3a and Fig. S8 (ESI†), the grain sizes of pristine FAPbI3 and FAMA are approximately 530 and 760 nm, respectively. For 4 mol% FASCl, a relatively compact and smooth surface morphology of the perovskite film is formed and a more uniform average grain size of 1080 nm is achieved, which is consistent with the cross-sectional SEM images of the planar PSC structure (Fig. 3b). However, when the content of FASCl is increased to more than 6 mol%, a poor film morphology with large pin-holes is observed. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for each sample support the effect of FASCl doping on the crystal quality of the perovskite film (Fig. 3c). The intensity of (001) and (002) peaks assigned to the black α-phase FAPbI3 increases with the doping of 4 mol% FASCl.41 The peak intensity is much higher than that of FAMA, and more than 4 mol% doping decreases the peak intensity. The better film quality of the 4 mol% FASCl-doped films with respect to the others is reflected in both the film morphology and the crystallinity.

(f) Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra of perovskite precursor solutions without and with FASCl (inset: images of the corresponding solution, with dimethylformamide [DMF] used as the solvent). (g) UV–vis absorption and normalised photoluminescence (PL) spectra (the perovskite deposited on glass) and (h) time-dependent PL decays of perovskite layers (on the glass substrate) of pristine, control, and 4 mol% FASCl-doped FAPbI3. The curved straight lines are the corresponding fitted lines. 
To understand the interactions between FASCl and the perovskite precursor, liquid-state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained from the FAI and 4 mol% FASCl-added FAI solutions (Fig. 3d). The NMR resonance peaks at ∼7.86 and 8.78 ppm from the FAI solution are attributable to the C–H bond and protons of the amine groups in the formamidinium cation (HC(NH2)2+),42 respectively. In the case of 4 mol% FASCl addition, the original peak at ∼8.78 ppm splits into two new peaks (8.84 and 9.09 ppm). Simultaneously, the original single peak at 7.86 ppm splits into multiple peaks owing to the supramolecular interaction between cationic HC(NH2)2+ and FASCl, as shown in the enlarged inset image.43,44 As shown in Fig. 3e, a lower shift observed in the proton signal for the PbI2–FASCl solution, in contrast to pure FASCl, confirms the existence of a strong coordinating interaction between Pb2+ and FASCl. Compared with each pristine precursor solution, the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra show an apparent red shift for FASCl when it is mixed with PbI2 or FAI (Fig. 3f). As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), although 10 mol% FASCl is not fully dissolved in 1 mL of DMF, after mixing with PbI2, more than 10 mol% FASCl can be perfectly dissolved. The FAS2+ ions would incorporate into the [PbI6]4− octahedral layer, probably constructing an intermediate phase of x[FAS2+]·2[PbI2Clx]x−. In Fig. S9d (ESI†), the newly formed peaks at 7.3° and 8.5° are associated with the intermediate phase, which may play a role in extra heterogeneous nucleation sites, retarding perovskite crystallisation and thereby improving the perovskite grain quality. Optical microscopy is used to investigate the perovskite crystallization process. The perovskite films were deposited on glass substrates using the spin-coating method and the optical images were taken as a function of the coating program time with the reference time, t0. As shown in Fig. s9–S1 (ESI†), in the pristine FAPbI3 film (Fig. s9–s1a, ESI†), the crystals were observed obviously after t0 + 5 s. However, in the case of the FAPbI3 film doped with 4 mol% FASCl, the crystal advent time was delayed to t0 + 8 s (Fig. s9–S1b, ESI†). In addition, compared with the density of crystals at the moment of crystal formation for the pristine sample, the FAPbI3 film doped with 4 mol% FASCl produces more crystals with very small sizes. This indicates that crystallization is retarded and occurs abruptly with a high nuclei density in the presence of FASCl, which is probably related to the strong interaction between FASCl and the perovskite precursor. By contrast, excess FASCl may accelerate the precursor solvation, which is undesirable for fabricating compact and highly crystalline PSCs.45,46
Steady-state photoluminescence (SSPL) and UV–vis data show that FASCl doping does not affect the band gap of FAPbI3, given the maintained emission peak position and absorption edge (Fig. 3g). The SSPL intensity of the perovskite film doped with 4 mol% FASCl is ∼2.96 times higher than that of the pristine FAPbI3 sample (Fig. S10, ESI†), indicating decreased nonradiative recombination.47 This is attributable to the suppressed charge localisation at the iodine vacancy with FASCl doping, which is consistent with the DFT calculation results. As shown in Fig. 3h, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) data fitted with a biexponential decay equation (see the fitting results in Table S1, ESI†) strongly support the suppressed charge localisation and the retarded charge recombination by FASCl doping. The average lifetimes increase from 181.09 ns (pristine, FAPbI3) to 777.96 ns (target, 4 mol%-FASCl-doped FAPbI3), which is about twice as long as that of FAMA (control, 324.62ns).
The n–i–p-based planar heterojunction architecture PSCs with an active area of 0.14 cm2 (Au/Spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite/TiO2/fluorine-doped tin oxide [FTO]) were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic properties. The best performing photovoltaic characteristics of the solar cells under various conditions are summarised in Table 1. Compared with pristine (FAPbI3) devices, a significant improvement in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the FF value were observed in the target device (4 mol%-FASCl-doped FAPbI3), where the average Voc increased from 1.082 to 1.172 V and the average FF increased from 0.766 to 0.826 owing to the retarded charge recombination by the addition of FASCl (Fig. 4a).48 The photovoltaic parameter distribution for a batch of 28 PSCs as a function of the FASCl concentration is shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The increase in Voc is not attributed to the increase in the band gap energy already confirmed by DFT calculations and UV–vis data. Considering that the band gap of the perovskite after doping with FASCl is around 1.516 eV (Fig. S12, ESI†), Voc loss is only 0.343V (Eabs q−1 − Voc) at the absorption threshold (Eabs), which is even less than that of crystal silicon solar cells (0.38V) and is comparable to GaAs solar cells (0.30V).49 These data are also supportive of the good passivation effect of FASCl.

Fig. 4b shows the external quantum efficiency spectrum obtained for each optimal condition to confirm the Jsc values in the J–V curves. The values of the integrated Jsc were 22.14, 22.65, and 23.51 mA cm−2 for the pristine, control, and target devices, respectively (no significant change in photocurrent). Consequently, the maximum PCE of the target devices increased remarkably from 19.59% to 23.11%, which is much higher than that of the control FAMA device (21.43%; Fig. 4c). The hysteresis index [HI = (PCEReverse − PCEForward)/PCEReverse] is decreased from 6.1% for the pristine device to 3.2% (control) and 1.4% (target), implying decreased defects in the FASCl-doped perovskite films, because the hysteresis originates from the defects, carrier trapping, and capacitive effects.50,51
To gain further insight into the device-performance enhancement resulting from the use of FASCl, the charge-carrier lifetimes and charge-carrier extraction capability were analysed using transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements, respectively.52 As shown in Fig. 4d, the decay times, also known as charge-recombination lifetimes (τr), of the pristine and control devices are around 6.26 and 18.97 μs, while the target device using 4 mol%-FASCl-doped FAPbI3 shows a much longer decay time (44.62 μs), demonstrating good consistency with the improved photovoltaic performance coming from defect annihilation. Meanwhile, TPC under the short-circuit condition was conducted to investigate the influence of FASCl on the charge transfer in the devices. The charge-transfer time (τt) of the FASCl-doped FAPbI3 decreases from 8.69 μs (pristine) and 7.65 μs (control) to 3.88 μs (target), which is indicative of the facilitated charge-transfer process in the target device originating from defect annihilation (Fig. 4e). Additionally, the improved crystallinity of FASCl-doped FAPbI3 would facilitate the charge transfer.
The stabilised power output curves of the pristine, control, and target PSCs under the maximum power conditions were tested under light soaking in ambient air (a relative humidity controlled at around 5–10%), as shown in Fig. 4f. The stabilised photocurrents of 21.34 mA cm−2 (@0.976 V) and 22.91 mA cm−2 (@0.997 V) were obtained for the control and target PSC devices (Fig. S13, ESI†) corresponding to the stabilised PCEs of 20.83% and 22.85%, respectively (i.e., much higher than that of the pristine device).
These results clearly show that FASCl doping significantly improves the long-term stability and efficiency of PSCs. Furthermore, we considered the perovskite film stability in light of the FASCl doping effect. As shown in Fig. S14 and S15 (ESI†), XRD data exhibit excellent moisture and thermal stabilities of the target film (4 mol% FASCl-doped FAPbI3) compared with other pristine and control films. To further confirm the enhancement in environmental stability of the solar cell devices, we monitored the change in PCE under different conditions without any encapsulation. Poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) was used for the damp-heat test, and the device performance with PTAA is shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†). Fig. 4g shows the thermal stability of the pristine, control, and target devices, heated at 85 °C in the dark using an Ar-filled glove box. After ageing for 1000 h, the target devices retained ∼92.5% of their initial PCE. However, only ∼54% (ageing 1000 h) and ∼32% (ageing 700 h) of the initial PCE were retained for the control and pristine devices, respectively. Additionally, Fig. 4h shows the moisture stability of the unencapsulated devices upon exposure to a relative humidity (RH) of approximately 50 ± 5% at room temperature in a dark commercial cabinet. Compared with a ∼66% degradation in the control device at 1000 h, the target devices only degraded by ∼8% after 1000 h. Moreover, the pristine device started to decrease in the first few days and did not work after 300 h. The retarded degradation can be ascribed to the presence of strong hydrogen bonding between the I− from PbI2 and the H–N groups from the FAS2+ ion, as evidenced by the high energy shift of iodine after FASCl doping (Fig. S17, ESI†). The improved stability originates from the decreased point defects via FASCl addition.
The space charge-limited current technique is used to investigate point defect annihilation using an electron-only device (FTO/TiO2/perovskite film/PCBM/Au). As shown in Fig. 5a, the trap density (ntrap) is determined by the trap filled limit voltage, VTFL = entrapL2/(2εε0), where L is the thickness of the perovskite film, ε and ε0 are the relative dielectric constants of the perovskite and the vacuum permittivity, respectively, and e is the elementary charge. In Fig. 5b, we investigated the light-intensity-dependent Voc of the PSCs for the pristine, control, and target devices measured under different light intensities. The target device shows a slope of 1.13 kBT/q, which is lower than the control (1.26 kBT/q) and pristine (1.52 kBT/q) devices, which indicates a substantially decreased trap-assisted recombination and efficient charge extraction resulting from the point-defect anihilation.53

(d) Mott–Schottky plots of PSCs for the pristine, control, and target devices. 
Electrical impedance spectroscopy was employed to study the potential carrier-transport behaviour in the PSCs. In Fig. 5c, the fitted equivalent circuit model is composed of the series resistance (Rs) and charge-recombination resistance (Rrec). The fitted Rs values are found to be in the order of pristine (26.3 Ω) > control (18.0 Ω) > target (14.3 Ω). The lower Rs value of the target device associated with the enhanced charge transfer may cause the higher FF of the target device.54 In addition, compared with the Rrec value of the pristine device (431 Ω), higher Rrec values of 577 Ω for the control device and 846 Ωfor the target device were obtained, indicating a lower recombination rate at the interfaces in FASCl-doped FAPbI3. Moreover, to analyse the improved photovoltaic performance of the target device, we obtained capacitance–voltage (C–V) curves and compared the built-in potential (Vbi) of the devices using the Mott–Schottky equation:  where A is the device area, NA is the carrier concentration, V is the applied bias, and C is the capacitance.55,56 The Vbi value for the pristine device was determined to be 0.934 V, increasing to 1.11 V for the target device (Fig. 5d). The significantly improved Vbi value implies a boosted driving force for the separation of photogenerated carriers, which is favourable for achieving a higher Voc with the retardation of charge recombination. In addition to the decreased point defects, the increase in Vbi is another reason for Voc improvement in the target device.
In this work, uniform and pin-hole-free perovskite films were prepared using 4 mol% FASCl-doped FAPbI3 for realising large-area and uniform PSMs (Fig. S18, ESI† and note). Details regarding the design of PSMs are described in Fig. S19–S21 (ESI†). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the PSMs prepared using different perovskite films are summarised in Table 2. The PSMs based on the target 4 mol%-FASCl-doped FAPbI3 film showed the best photovoltaic performance with an aperture area PCE of 18.76%. The corresponding active area (23.27 cm2) efficiency was 20.75% with a geometric fill factor (GFF) of 90.4%. However, the highest efficiencies of the PSMs prepared using the pristine (FAPbI3) or control (FAMA) samples were only 15.49% (active area, 17.13%) and 17.46% (active area, 19.31%), respectively. These results confirm that the FASCl-doped FAPbI3 films are suitable for achieving high-performance large-sized PSMs as well as those in small-sized cells. We achieved a maximum PCE and a FF of 20.75% and 0.785, respectively (Fig. 6a). To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest FF and PCE for ∼25 cm2 PSMs achieved so far and reflects the inherent defect annihilation of perovskite materials as well as large size uniformity (Fig. S22 and Table S5, ESI†). Moreover, the average voltage contribution of each sub-cell (Voc-Sub) is around 1.177 V (Voc-Sub = Total Voc of module/sub-cell number), which is comparable to the unit small cell (0.14 cm2), indicating that there is no voltage loss during the size-upscaling process. Statistical analysis of the PSM performance data based on 16 PSMs is presented in Fig. S23 (ESI†) (an average PCE of 18.25% from 16 modules). The corresponding steady PCE at the maximum power condition was tested under light soaking in ambient air (a RH controlled to 5–10%), as presented in Fig. 6b. The optimal module based on the target material showed a stabilised aperture-area PCE of 17.9% (active area, 19.8%) for 2000 s tracking at a bias voltage of 7.87 V, exhibiting good operation stability.

Fig. 6c shows the storage stability result of the unit cell and the PSMs. Usually, the unit cell shows a relatively good storage stability in comparison with PSMs because the fabrication process of the PSMs using laser scribing may induce degradation of the perovskite films (details are shown in Fig. S24 and S25, ESI†).2,57 It is noteworthy that our target module exhibits a storage stability comparable to the unit cell, whereas the other pristine and control PSMs show rapid degradation. These results are related to the aforementioned superior long-term stability characteristics of our FASCl-doped FAPbI3 material. To further confirm the up-scalability of our module coating method, we fabricated PSMs with 12 sub-cells in series on a 100 cm2 FTO substrate (Fig. S26, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 6d, the optimal PCE of 15.87% was achieved with a Voc of 13.92 V, a Jsc of 1.514 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.753 for an aperture area of 65.22 cm2 (forward scan, 14.18%; Voc, 13.92 V; Jsc, 1.505 mA cm−2; and FF 0.677). The corresponding GFF of the PSMs is 90.97%, which indicates that the active-area PCE is up to 17.44% (15.58%, forward). These results demonstrate the potential use of FASCl-doped FAPbI3 perovskite films for the commercialisation of PSCs.
Conclusions
In this study, we developed perovskite solar cell modules based on FAS2+ ion doping, which is known as a strong oxidant. Large FAS2+ ions were incorporated into the octahedral structure by substituting two adjacent FA ions. Since the FAS2+ ion is a strong oxidant, it tends to attract electrons and prevents the formation of the defect complex Pb–VI−–Pb, which acts as a deep trap or a recombination centre in FAPbI3 with an intrinsic anion defect (i.e. iodine vacancy). The DFT study shows the detailed mechanism of preventing the formation of the defect complex and the relevant electronic structures, consequently eliminating deep traps or recombination centres upon FAS2+ doping. FAS2+ doping also stabilises the black α-phase FAPbI3 and causes the formation of intermediate phases with FAI or PbI2, which retards the crystallisation process of the perovskite film, leading to uniform and high-crystallinity perovskite films. The suppressed nonradiative recombination centres with improved crystallinity lead to a high Voc of 1.173 V (with a voltage deficit of 0.343 V), a remarkable FF of 83.4%, and a maximum PCE value of 23.11%, along with a steady-state output efficiency value of 22.8% for the target devices. In addition, the unencapsulated target devices containing FASCl exhibited outstanding humidity and thermal stability. Finally, the strategy was successfully extended to both 23.27 cm2 and 59.35 cm2 perovskite solar cell modules and yielded remarkable performance values of 20.75% and 17.44%, respectively.

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained much attention recently due to their ever-increasing solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency (PCE), low cost, and convenient solution fabrication processes. As a promising and competitive candidate for future photovoltaic devices, the cubic α-phase of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) has emerged as one of the most appealing materials due to its excellent high light absorption and long diffusion length. However, the intrinsic defects (i.e. iodine vacancy) accompanied by strong electron localisation become recombination centers and deteriorate the photovoltaic properties. Consequently, the prevention of electron localization in defects is of critical importance for high-efficiency PSCs and industrial-scale perovskite solar modules (PSMs). Here, we investigated an efficient strategy to prevent electron localisation in the iodine vacancy by incorporating an electron scavenger. This makes the iodine vacancy lose the strongly localised electrons and removes the deep traps owing to the strong reduction tendency. This also stabilises the α-phase FAPbI3 and retards the crystallization rate, leading to compact full-coverage perovskite layers with high crystallinity and a large grain size. We found that the perovskite films deposited on 25.74 cm2 and 65.22 cm2 substrates exhibit superior uniformity and excellent photovoltaic properties. As a result, we achieved a remarkable performance of 18.76% and 15.87%, respectively.
