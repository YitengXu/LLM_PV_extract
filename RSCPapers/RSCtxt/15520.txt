1. Introduction
The emission of carbon dioxide and other global warming gases generated from the continuous combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, gasoline, and natural gas, has led to various environmental issues. In order to reduce the dependence on these finite and non-renewable resources, battery and fuel cell technologies are considered to be clean and effective strategies, which can realize the concept of zero-emission. Fuel cells, supercapacitors, and batteries are all electrochemical storage devices and share many similarities in that they provide electricity by an electrochemical reaction between two electrodes. A battery stores chemical reactants, such as lithium, sodium, manganese, aluminum, and zinc. Once the energy has been exhausted, the battery must be recharged or disposed of. Fuel cells are different from batteries in that they generate electricity through reactants (hydrogen and oxygen) that are stored externally, so they can produce electricity continuously as long as the reactants continue to be supplied. In short, a fuel-cell vehicle is refueled while a battery-powered vehicle is recharged. Batteries and supercapacitors could be suitable for averaging out energy production from many renewable resources, such as solar, hydropower, geothermal, and wind energy, filling energy shortfalls during on-peak periods.1–3 Fuel cells have various advantages, such as zero-emission of natural gas (water is the byproduct) and stable power-source generation, (no “memory effect” when they are refueled).4–6 Therefore, as a promising energy and environmental solution for the future, battery and fuel cell technologies have attracted much attention in materials science and engineering. Commercial vehicles with power sources, such as batteries (Tesla) and fuel cells (Toyota), represent two areas in which significant progress has been achieved. However, we still need to find suitable electrode materials to meet the requirements for high cycle durability, high performance, and low cost.
Recently, niobium-based oxides have emerged as the most prominent materials for batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cell technologies.7–9 Their unique chemical stability under acid conditions (niobium-based oxides were applied as highly stable electrochemical supports for fuel cells),10,11 and their high potential window, which can prevent the formation of lithium dendrites, as well as their rich redox chemistry (Nb5+/Nb4+, Nb4+/Nb3+), which contributes to their high specific capacity/capacitance (higher than those of a conventional Li4Ti5O12 anode),12–14 make them very promising electrode materials. Unfortunately, the sluggish lithium-ion diffusivity in niobium-based oxides limits their rate performance. The poor electronic conductivity of Nb2O5 reduces the charge transfer in fuel cells and batteries, and the low surface area resulting from a high preparation temperature limits their capacitive contribution. To solve these problems, tremendous research efforts have been made to improve electron transfer and lithium ion diffusion by combining conductive materials (i.e. graphene, carbon-coatings, and carbon nanotubes) or reducing the electrode materials to the nanoscale.15–17 Combining conductive materials with niobium-based oxides and reducing electrode materials to the nanoscale can offer several advantages, including: (i) short path lengths for lithium ion diffusion and electron transport and fast charge transfer, resulting in a fast diffusion rate (i.e., higher power); (ii) increased contact area per unit mass in the electrolyte/electrode, which could enhance the kinetics of lithium-ion diffusion across the interface for batteries (i.e., higher charge/discharge rates) and more ion adsorption sites on the surface or near the surface for charge transfer reactions of supercapacitors (i.e., higher specific capacitances); (iii) a larger surface area to support the noble metal, so as to increase the performance in fuel cells; and (iv) significantly enhanced synergistic effect between the noble metal and metal oxide supports.
Recently, nanostructured TiO2 and layered transition-metal dichalcogenides for the application of energy storage have been reviewed.18,19 In this review, we summarize the recent progress made towards niobium-based oxide electrode engineering strategies for batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cell applications. The crystal structures of niobium-based oxides, especially Nb2O5 and TiNb2O7, are presented. Moreover, charge storage mechanisms, electrochemical performances, cycling stability, and the rate capability of niobium-based oxides are discussed. In addition, insights into the future research and development of niobium-based oxide compounds for next-generation batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cell devices are provided.
2. Nb-based oxides for LIBs
LIBs play a vital role in our daily lives as the dominant power sources for portable electronics, as well as automotive systems, due to their high energy density, long cycling life, and good environmental compatibility.20–22 A typical LIB device consists of a positive electrode (anode, e.g., graphite), a lithium-ion conducting electrolyte, and a negative electrode (cathode, e.g., LiCoO2). Upon charging, Li-ions are extracted from the cathode host, pass through the electrolyte, and intercalate into the anode. Discharge is the reverse process. Although such batteries are commercially successful, they cannot fulfill the performance requirements of next-generation LIBs. Further breakthroughs in electrode materials are expected. The demonstration of reversible lithium insertion into transition-metal–oxide anodes has made the advent of high-energy LIBs possible. Among these, lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12) and niobium-based oxides have received great interest due to their considerable safety advantages. Their redox potentials (1.0–2.0 V) match with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the organic liquid-carbonate electrolytes, avoiding the formation of a passivating solid-electrolyte-interface (SEI) layer.23–25 Compared with the low capacity of Li4Ti5O12 (140 mA h g−1), the high capacity of Nb-based oxides (∼200 mA h g−1), which are related to the multiple valences of Nb, could be of great benefit for LIB anodes.23
2.1 Niobium oxides
Niobium–oxides mainly exist in the forms of stoichiometric Nb2O5 (+5), NbO2 (+4), Nb2O3 (+3), and NbO (+2). Nb2O5, an n-type transition metal oxide semiconductor with a band gap of about 3.4 eV, has shown remarkable properties in the fields of gas sensing, catalysis, electrochromics, and photoelectrodes, as well as in LIB anodes.26–31 Nb2O5 exists in many polymorphic forms, e.g., pseudohexagonal (H-Nb2O5), orthorhombic (O-Nb2O5), tetragonal (T-Nb2O5), and monoclinic phases (M-Nb2O5).31–33 Their crystal structures are shown in Fig. 1.33 M-Nb2O5 is the most thermodynamically stable phase, while H-Nb2O5 is the least stable one and can be readily transformed into M-Nb2O5 by appropriate heat treatment. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1, amorphous Nb2O5 synthesized at low temperatures crystallizes into H-Nb2O5 or O-Nb2O5 at around 500 °C, and transforms to T-Nb2O5 at ∼800 °C. M-Nb2O5 is always produced when heated to temperatures above 1000 °C. Since early studies in the 1980s,34 considerable effort has been devoted to developing high-performance Nb2O5 anodes for LIB applications.

In 1999, Kumagai et al.35 produced H-, O- and M-Nb2O5 compounds that formed under different heating temperatures. They displayed high initial discharge capacities of 180–200 mA h g−1 with charge–discharge cycling at a potential around 1.5 V vs. Li/Li+ (Fig. 2a–c). The electrochemical reaction was represented as Nb2O5 + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixNb2O5 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2), but their structural changes were different as a result of electrochemical lithium intercalation. The H- and O-Nb2O5 exhibited a single phase LixNb2O5 on discharge, while M-Nb2O5 showed a larger repulsive interaction between ions, resulting in a two-phase equilibrium from x = 1 to 2 in LixNb2O5. In 2006, the same group36 examined the electrochemical charge–discharge behavior of Nb2O5 phases formed at different temperatures in the range 400–1100 °C by using in situ synchrotron radiation (SR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) techniques. The electrochemical measurement of Nb2O5 phases with various crystals showed that O- and T-Nb2O5 had a better cycle life performance in the voltage window 1.2–3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+). The in situ SR-XRD patterns indicated that the original crystal structures of O- and T-Nb2O5 are maintained without the appearance of any new phases during the insertion of lithium into their matrices, and their volume change is less than 1%, which guarantees a good battery performance. The in situ extended XAFS (EXAFS) spectra of the Nb K-edge in O- and T-LixNb2O5 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) were further measured. As seen from the Nb K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra (Fig. 2d and e), the absorption edge shifted continuously to a low-energy side from that of Nb2O5 to one similar to that of NbO2, as the x-value in LixNb2O5 increased, indicating a reduction from Nb5+ to Nb4+ in both Nb2O5 phases. Fig. 2f and g show the Fourier transforms (FTs) of the k3-weighted Nb K-edge EXAFS oscillations of LixNb2O5. The first peak at ∼1.5 Å is related to the Nb–O interaction in the first coordination sphere, and the second one at ∼3.5 Å is ascribed to the Nb–Nb interaction in the second coordination sphere. The Nb–O peak intensity in O-LixNb2O5 is higher than that of the Nb–Nb peak, whereas in T-LixNb2O5, the Nb–Nb peak intensity is much higher than that of the Nb–O peak, due to the two-dimensional (2D) planar arrangement of the Nb atoms in the tetragonal phase. On the other hand, it is found that the intensity decrease of the Nb–Nb peak in the O-type structure is much less than that in the T-type, which is probably associated with lithium intercalation into the vacant interstitial sites in the three-dimensional (3D) framework structure of O-Nb2O5. It appeared that the 2D layer structure of T-Nb2O5 is more favorable for reversible Li intercalation compared with the 3D structure of O-Nb2O5, resulting in a relatively better performance for T-Nb2O5. Further progress with respect to Nb2O5 anodes for practical applications faces challenges due to their intrinsic poor electric conductivity (∼3 × 10−6 S cm−1) and the capacity decay from pulverization during the charge–discharge process. Building nanostructures with desirable morphology and size is a promising way to address these issues. Generally, electrode materials with nano-sized structures would have a short ion-diffusion path and would provide a large contact area between the electrolyte solution and electrodes. They also accommodate more mechanical strain and structural distortion from lithium insertion/extraction, leading to a high specific capacity and a high rate performance.2,37,38 Compared to zero-dimensional (0D) nanoparticles, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures, such as nanowires, nanofibers, and nanotubes, can provide directional electronic and ionic transportation, avoiding disconnection of the nanoparticles and the relatively poor ionic transportation of nanoparticles. Therefore, Viet et al.12 synthesized 1D Nb2O5 nanofibers in different polymorphic forms by appropriate heat treatment of the as-spun composite polymeric fibers. XRD analysis shows that H-Nb2O5 (500 °C, 1 h), O-Nb2O5 (800 °C, 1 h), M-Nb2O5 (1000 °C, 1 h), M-Nb2O5 (1100 °C, 1 h), and M-Nb2O5 (1100 °C, 11 h) were successfully prepared. As observed in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3a–c), the H- and O-phases maintained the usual nanofibrous morphology with an average diameter of around 160 nm, whereas the M-phase adopted submicrometer sized “near-1D” nugget-like morphology. Electrochemical measurement indicates that all of the nanofibrous polymorphs show good cycling stability due to the peculiar porous structure of the electrospun nanofibers; however, their specific capacities differ considerably, depending on their crystal structures (Fig. 3d). M-Nb2O5 (1100 °C, 1 h) exhibits the highest capacity, about 242 and 218 mA h g−1 during the 2nd and the 25th cycles, respectively, at a current density of 50 mA g−1 in the voltage range 1.0–2.6 V (vs. Li/Li+). This is probably due to the facile kinetics of Li-ion intake in M-Nb2O5. It was shown that the calculated lithium diffusion coefficients for the H-, O- and M-Nb2O5 phases are in the ranges 10−17–10−16, 10−15–10−14, and 10−13–10−12 cm2 s−1, respectively, using a galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT).39 The nanobelt, another novel 1D nanostructure, is also a promising structure, which could benefit lithium-ion diffusion. Recently, Nb2O5 nanobelts with thicknesses of ∼15 nm, widths of ∼60 nm and lengths of several tens of micrometers were prepared by a hydrothermal method.40 Electrochemical testing was done in the voltage range 1.2–3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) under a current density of 100 mA g−1. The first discharge and charge capacities are as high as 250 and 210 mA h g−1, respectively. Furthermore, even at a high current density of 10 A g−1, the capacity still reaches 50 mA h g−1, indicating a high-rate performance. The Nb2O5 nanowire superstructure, as an LIB anode, exhibited a high capacity of 177 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and had excellent cycling stability.41

Electrodes with 2D nanostructures also deliver remarkable electrochemical performances, due to their large contact areas, enhanced open-edged morphologies and finite lateral sizes.42–44 As shown in Fig. 4a and b, O-type Nb2O5 nanosheets with thicknesses of 50 nm and lengths of 500 nm were produced from the hydrothermal precursor, Nb3O7F.45 The Nb2O5 nanosheet anode delivered a superior electrochemical performance with an initial discharge capacity of 184 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. Meanwhile, a high-rate performance with 90 mA h g−1 at 5 C and excellent cycling stability were also observed (Fig. 4c). Additionally, Luo et al.46 also prepared Nb2O5 (O- and M-type mixed phase) nanosheets by a simple hydrothermal method using NbO2 particles as the precursor. An initial discharge capacity as high as 355 mA h g−1 was achieved at a current density of 100 mA g−1, and after 40 cycles, the reversible capacity still remained at 185 mA h g−1. Their superior performance is due to the structure of the nano-chip, which reduces the lithium ion diffusion distance and maintains good contact between the nanosheets and acetylene black.

Hierarchical nanostructures are also highly attractive with regard to application in LIBs.47–49 As a result, H-Nb2O5 hollow nanospheres with an average diameter of ∼29 nm and a hollow cavity size of ∼17 nm were successfully fabricated, which delivered a high discharge capacity of 197 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.5 C, and the capacity retention could be maintained at around 90% of the initial capacity after 250 cycles.50 Also, hierarchical flower-like O-Nb2O5 microspheres were produced via a facile and template-free method.51 As shown in Fig. 5a, the entire formation process of hierarchical Nb2O5 microspheres involves two stages: nucleation and Ostwald ripening. The representative SEM images (Fig. 5b and c) of the product show a large quantity of flower-like microspheres (average diameter of 1.2 μm) constructed from 2D nanoflakes with thicknesses of 30 nm. When evaluated as anode materials for LIBs, Nb2O5 microspheres exhibited excellent cycle stability and reversibility, e.g., from 217.5 mA h g−1 during the 8th cycle to 219.5 mA h g−1 during the 200th cycle at a current rate of 50 mA g−1. Furthermore, a tightly packed vein-like nonporous network of O-Nb2O5 was prepared recently by a simple electrochemical anodization process (Fig. 5d).52Fig. 5e shows a cross-sectional side view of an annealed Nb2O5 film, which consisted of a continuous and tightly packed vein-like nanoporous network. High-magnification observation (Fig. 5f) reveals that the nano-veins have internal diameters ranging from 30 to 50 nm with many lateral interconnections. Such unique structures would provide efficient channels for the fast transfer of both Li-ions and electrons. Hence, the nonporous Nb2O5 anode delivered a high reversible capacity of up to 300 cycles at a current density of 0.4 A g−1. The rate performance test showed that a capacity of 141 mA h g−1 was obtained at a very high current density of 2.6 A g−1. On the other hand, developing a binder-free Nb2O5 electrode directly on the current collector could also enhance the charge transfer significantly, resulting in a superior rate and cycle performance.14,53,54 For instance, a length of about 1 μm of Nb2O5 nanorod array film was prepared by Wen et al.54 through a facile hydrothermal process, and a reversible capacity of about 400 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 was obtained after 50 cycles.

It is well known that poor electronic conductivity limits the diffusion of lithium ions and charge transfer, resulting in a poor electrochemical performance. When using Li4Ti5O12 and TiO2 as anode materials for LIBs, a common way to improve the conductivity is to combine it with other conductive materials, such as amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene.13,55,56 For example, we recently reported that a conforming coating of TiO2 on CNTs would significantly improve the rate performance and cycle durability, compared with pure TiO2.57 Concerning Nb2O5 anodes, Kumagai et al. firstly introduced graphite into Nb2O5 electrodes, so as to increase their electronic conductivities,35,58 and found that the content of the graphite in the Nb2O5 electrode had a marked influence on the cycling behavior. Later, oxygen-deficient niobium oxide immersed in a carbon matrix by a one-step facile hydrothermal synthesis was reported.59 The carbon matrix and oxygen-deficient niobium oxide could enhance the charge transfer and prevent niobium oxide nanocrystals from pulverization during the charge–discharge process, which could efficiently improve the cycle durability and rate performance. The niobium oxide/carbon matrix structure developed in our group could provide a new design to achieve a high cycle durability and rate performance for low-electronic-conductivity anode materials, especially for TiO2 and niobium-based oxides.
Besides Nb2O5, some other niobium oxides, e.g., NbOx17 and Nb12O29,60 were also reported as anode materials for LIBs with promising lithium storage properties. For instance, NbOx@C nanoparticles were successfully fabricated through the oleylamine-mediated hydrolysis of niobium(V) chloride under solvothermal reaction,17 and these delivered about 298 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at a rate of 100 mA g−1.
2.2 Li(K)–Nb–O compounds
Rhombohedral LiNbO3, a famous ferroelectric material that is widely used in electro-optics, is also considered to be an interesting anode in LIBs, with a large theoretical capacity of 363 mA h g−1 (based on the redox couple, Nb5+/Nb3+, at a voltage of 1.0–1.7 V).61–63 To improve the kinetics of LiNbO3 for high-power LIB applications, Fan et al.63 developed a superior hybrid anode composed of CNTs and LiNbO3 nanoplates (CNT–LiNbO3). CNTs were used to build a 3D-conductive network and also acted as a backbone to load LiNbO3 nanoplates. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, self-weaving CNT–LiNbO3 hybrids were synthesized using a rhodanine acetic acid-pyrene (RAAP)-directed growth method. RAAP-decorated CNTs are hydrophilic, and the carboxylate groups on RAAP could supply active sites for the sol–gel growth of LiNbO3 nanoplates. An SEM image (Fig. 6b) indicates that the LiNbO3 nanoplates have a lateral dimension of 100–300 nm and are threaded by the CNT networks. Such an architecture can easily achieve rapid electron transport and lithium-ion diffusion (Fig. 6c). After further hybridization with a conductive and elastic polymer of polypyrrole (PPy), a flexible, free-standing CNT–LiNbO3 nanoplate-PPy bulky paper anode was fabricated. As shown in Fig. 6d, the discharge curves of this anode exhibit two different regions corresponding to the complete reduction of Nb5+ to Nb4+ and the partial reduction of Nb4+ to Nb3+, yielding reversible capacities of around 250 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.4 A g−1 with a high capacity of 220 mA h g−1 remaining after 500 cycles. Moreover, this hybrid anode presents an excellent rate capability (Fig. 6e), e.g., delivering a capacity of 150 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 4 A g−1.

Furthermore, another strategy, a microwave-induced auto-combustion reaction, was utilized to fabricate 3D porous LiNbO3 nanocomposites (10–20 nm), which showed a large surface area of 57.8 m2 g−1, supplying a large interfacial area for electrochemical reactions and enabling lithium-ion transport between the electrode/electrolyte.59 The electrochemical results demonstrated that this 3D porous LiNbO3 anode delivered a reversible charge/discharge capacity of 200 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and retained 175 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles.
In addition to the rhombohedral structure, a new polymorph of LiNbO3 with a lamellar structure (space group: P21/a), consisting of very similar stacked [NbO3]∞ layers along the c direction (Fig. 6f), was also developed for reversible lithium intercalation.64 This was synthesized from a topotactic reaction of CuNbO3 with eutectic LiCl/LiNO3. The electrochemical behaviour (Fig. 6g) of this new phase is quite attractive, showing the ability to intercalate one Li per formula (i.e., Li2NbO3) at a potential of 1.5 V during the first discharge process, and a reversible capacity of 0.7 Li per formula (120 mA h g−1). LiNb3O8 crystallizes in the monoclinic structure (space group: P1121/a), which is constructed from Nb–O distorted octahedrons with Li atoms occupying partial octahedral sites.65 Xu et al. comprehensively studied 1D porous LiNb3O8 nanofibers in LIBs, prepared through a simple electrospinning route followed by a post-treatment process.66 SEM and TEM observations reveal that the LiNb3O8 nanofibers were polycrystalline, involving many interconnected LiNb3O8 nanocrystals (∼20 nm) and numerous nanosized pores (∼18 nm).

Fig. 7a depicts the voltage profiles of the porous LiNb3O8 anode for the initial two charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 30 mA g−1.66 The charge–discharge curves could be divided into several regions. During the first discharging, two plateaus (b1–c1 and d1–f1) are clearly observed. In the subsequent charging, the plateaus disappeared and were replaced by an S-shaped curve, which retained its shape during the following cycles. To reveal the lithium storage mechanisms, in situ XRD patterns were recorded at various voltage stages during the first cycle (Fig. 7b). During lithiation between points a1–e1, the main peaks moved towards lower angles and the structure of Li1+xNb3O8 was maintained. However, at the end of discharging (point f1), the structure of Li1+xNb3O8 was destroyed and two new phases (Li2NbO3 and Nb2O5) were generated. In the subsequent cycles, the XRD patterns remain unchanged, suggesting the reversibility characteristic of intercalation/de-intercalation reactions. Thus, the electrochemical reactions of LiNb3O8 were proposed as follows: LiNb3O8 + 3.6Li+ + 3.6e− → Li2.6Nb2O5 + Li2NbO3(1) Li2.6Nb2O5 ↔ Nb2O5 + 2.6Li+ + 2.6e−(2) Li2NbO3 ↔ LiNbO3 + Li+ + e−(3)

Furthermore, as promoted by its unique 1D porous nanostructure, this LiNb3O8 electrode exhibited superior electrochemical properties. It delivered initial discharge capacities of 241.1, 231.2 and 217.0 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.5 and 1 C, respectively. After 100 cycles, corresponding specific capacities of 170.1, 141.9 and 119.2 mA h g−1 were maintained.
KNb5O13 (orthorhombic Pbmc structure) is isostructural with KTa5O13, which consists of 2D a–b slabs of edge- and corner-sharing NbO6 octahedra, and these slabs are interconnected to create a 3D framework.67–69 Although the K+ cations reside in the empty channels, there is still room to intercalate Li+ cations into them, which allows the energy of the Nb5+/Nb4+ couple to be probed. The lithiation and delithiation behavior of KNb5O13 at a current of 20 mA g−1 is shown in Fig. 8 (middle).69 Upon discharging, two plateaus (B and D–E) represented two-phase regions, and a solid-solution range, C, was displayed. During the subsequent charging process, an obvious solid-solution range, J, and a large plateau, K–L, were observed. The proposed detailed lithiation/delithiation process is shown in Fig. 8. These experiments demonstrated that only 1D a-axis tunnels had access to the electrolyte during lithiation/delithiation, which connected to multiple off-axis sites (4c, 4d, and 8e), resulting in a polarization hysteresis in the potential profile. Additionally, another potassium niobate, K6Nb10.8O30, also exhibited an attractive capacity (around 160 mA h g−1) for reversible Li uptake/removal with a solid-solution range between 0.9 and 1.7 V (vs. Li/Li+).68

2.3 Ti–Nb–O compounds
Considering that the atomic radii of niobium and titanium are similar, niobium oxides can form solid solutions with titanium oxides under high temperature calcination.70 Thus, many types of titanium–niobium oxide compounds, such as TiNb2O7, Ti2Nb2O9 and Ti2Nb10O29, could be formed and used as alternative anode materials for LIBs due to their high lithium storage capacity and safe lithiation potentials (1.7 to 1.0 V vs. Li/Li+).71–73 Most of these oxides have been used as anode materials for LIBs, especially for TiNb2O7. Similar to Nb2O5, TiNb2O7 is also a wide-bandgap compound (2.9 eV) and has been used in photo-catalysis applications. TiNb2O7 belongs to the monoclinic system (space group C2/m; unit cell parameters a = 20.351 Å, b = 3.801 Å, c = 11.882 Å, and β = 120.19°). In this monoclinic structure, NbO6 and TiO6 octahedra share edges and corners, and the Ti and Nb atoms, located at the central positions of the octahedra, are randomly distributed, while the 2D interstitial space existing in the monoclinic layered structure offers accommodation for up to 5 lithium atoms per unit formula. This five-electron electrochemical reaction corresponds to redox reactions (Ti4+/Ti3+, Nb5+/Nb4+ and Nb4+/Nb3+) that deliver a high theoretical capacity of 387.6 mA h g−1, almost twice than that of Li4Ti5O12. Lithium insertion and extraction in TiNb2O7 was initially studied by Cava et al.74 It was found that the structure could be retained (volume change 3.6%) during the electrochemical process of lithium insertion and extraction. In situ XRD showed that the volume of the crystal increases from 0.794 to 0.833 nm3 after the charging process, and could revert back to 0.794 nm3 after the discharging process, indicating that TiNb2O7 exhibits excellent cycle durability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and light and dark field electron microscopies were used for an in-depth investigation of the mechanism of lithium insertion and extraction in TiNb2O7. It was found that lithium ions were stored in the (001) plane of TiNb2O7, and the distance between the (001) planes increased from 1.03 nm to 1.15 nm.75 The high cycle durability resulting from the small volume change during the charge–discharge process and the high theoretical capacity of TiNb2O7 makes it a very promising anode material for LIBs. Recently, carbon-coated TiNb2O7 (TiNb2O7/C) and Nb (10%)-doped Ti0.9Nb2O7 (Ti1.1Nb2.1O7) were tested as anodes for LIBs,71,76 as shown in Fig. 9. The initial discharge capacity of TiNb2O7/C was 285 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C with no capacity loss after 40 cycles. Besides, a plateau at 1.6 V was also observed. Even more importantly, these materials also exhibited excellent rate performances and about 150 mA h g−1 at a current density of 2C under a potential window of 1.4–2.5 V. Also, doping Nb for Ti could improve the intrinsic conductivity, which would improve the performance. Considering the flat potential plateau for TiNb2O7, a 3 V full cell with TiNb2O7 as anode and LiMn2O4 as cathode was proposed by Goodenough et al., and this full cell exhibited an excellent cycling performance.76

In general, the formation temperature of TiNb2O7 is fairly high (900–1100 °C), resulting in TiNb2O7 having a low surface area, which could decrease the kinetics of lithium diffusion. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare TiNb2O7 with a high surface area. Recently, we prepared TiNb2O7 nanoparticles with a particle size of 10 nm using an SBA-15 template.77 The capacity of TiNb2O7 with a smaller particle size was about 250 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C, with a high coulombic efficiency (above 98% over 300 cycles). The enhanced electrochemical performance of TiNb2O7 nanoparticles is attributed to its high surface area, which not only increases the contact area between the electrolyte and the electrode material but also reduces the lithium diffusion path. Beyond the TiNb2O7 nanoparticles, TiNb2O7 with an ordered mesoporous structure not only provides a high surface area but also provides extra channels for lithium ion diffusion. TiNb2O7 with a mesoporous structure, synthesized by assisted self-assembly of a block copolymer, has a particle size of 15 nm and a pore size of 40 nm. Due to its relatively large specific surface area, capacities of 289, 162, and 116 mA h g−1 were obtained at 0.1, 20 and 50 C, respectively. The retention ratio remains around 81% after 2000 cycles at 10 C.78 Guo et al. used F127 as a template to prepare a porous structure of TiNb2O7; an excellent cycle performance with a capacity retention rate of 84% and a rate-reversible capacity of 200 mA h g−1 was obtained after 1000 cycles at 5 C.79 Qian et al. also used P123 as a template to prepare TiNb2O7 porous nanospheres.80 Preparing TiNb2O7 with a rich porosity with the assistance of templates, such as F127, SBA-15, and block copolymers, would increase the production cost and complexity. Hierarchical TiNb2O7 microspheres were synthesized by a one-step facile and low-cost solvothermal synthesis.81 The morphology and elemental distribution can be seen in Fig. 10.

Therefore, the TiNb2O7 microspheres with a hierarchical porous structure exhibit an exceptionally high rate capability and an excellent cycling performance. Besides, TiNb2O7 nanofibers with a diameter of ∼100 nm were fabricated by a simple electrospinning method;82 after calcination at high temperature, a “nano-pearl” morphology was prepared, as shown in Fig. 11.

This novel nanostructured material with nano-pearl morphology exhibited a high rate capacity (85 mA h g−1 at 50 C) and good capacity retention, since this 1D nanostructure had favorable kinetic properties. An excellent electrochemical performance for TiNb2O7 with 1D nanofibers, prepared by electrospinning, was also obtained by Ramakrishna et al.83 while TiNb2O7 nanorods prepared by a simple sol–gel method also exhibited excellent rate and cycle durability.84 Actually, TiNb2O7 with a band gap of 2.7 eV shows poor electronic conductivity; however, fast lithium-ion and electron conductivity are necessary for LIBs with a high electrochemical performance. Doping elements into TiNb2O7 is a general strategy for improving the conductivity. For example, ruthenium-doped TiNb2O7, Ru0.01Ti0.99Nb2O7, delivered an enhanced lithium-ion diffusion coefficient and electronic conductivity, resulting in an improved electrochemical performance.85 However, considering the high price of the ruthenium precursor, it is still a challenge to improve the conductivity of TiNb2O7 using a low-cost doping strategy. Combination with conducting materials or coating conductive materials on TiNb2O7 would be another way to improve the conductivity; for example, a TiNb2O7/graphene composite could be developed.86 It is reported that porous TiNb2O7 nanofibers decorated with conductive TiNbN bumps could significantly improve the electrochemical performance.87 Recently, partial nitridation of TiNb2O7 was thought of as a practical way to improve the performance of LIBs. The porous structure and conducting Ti1−xNbxN layer on porous TiNb2O7 enhanced the transport kinetics associated with lithium ions and electrons, resulting in a high discharge capacity of 265 mA h g−1, a remarkable rate capability and an excellent cycle durability (about 91% capacity retention compared to the initial value after 1000 cycles at 5 C).88
Recently, Ti2Nb10O29, another typical titanium–niobium oxide, was also developed as an anode material for LIBs.89–91 As a powerful technique to investigate the mechanism of lithium insertion and extraction, in situ XRD showed that the electrochemical reaction of Ti2Nb10O29 at a high potential window (1.6–3.0 V) and a low potential region (1.0–1.5 V) is a solid solution reaction, while the platform area (1.4–1.6 V) is a region of two-phase coexistence.72 The good rate performance of Ti2Nb10O29 was attributed to the open ReO3 structure. Recently, employing Ti2Nb10O29 as anode and LiFePO4 as cathode, a full cell exhibited high coulombic efficiency and excellent cycle durability, indicating that Ti2Nb10O29 could be used as an anode in commercial LIBs.92 TiNb6O17, with a similar crystal structure to Ti2Nb10O29, has also been applied as an anode material for LIBs with a fair electrochemical performance.93
2.4 Other niobium-based oxide (M–Nb–O, M = V, Al, and W)
Introducing elemental vanadium into the Nb2O5 pure phase can increase the theoretical capacity of Nb2O5. Therefore, V2O5 and Nb2O5 composites with different ratios were developed as anode materials for LIBs. NbVO5 with a high ratio of V2O5 to Nb2O5 showed a poor rate performance.94 Only composites with a lower V2O5 concentration (10 wt%) exhibited an acceptable capacity of 200 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1. Tetragonal VNb9O24.9-based nanorods were synthesized through an aerosol-assisted process.95 This new form in a V–Nb–O system showed an outstanding cycling stability as well as a moderate rate capability. The electrochemical properties are consistent with the unique susceptibility of the structure to intercalate lithium reversibly. This specific effect after introducing vanadium can improve the performance and cycle stability. Current research on vanadium and niobium oxide composites is limited, but its superior electrochemical performance should attract more and more attention from researchers around the world.
The lithium ion insertion and extraction behavior of AlNbO4 was initially investigated by Zachau et al.96 and the capacity of these materials were dependent on the operation temperatures due to the poor delithiation dynamic kinetics. It was shown that only 0.1 mol Li+ can be embedded per mole AlNbO4 at room temperature.97 Although an enhanced electrochemical performance was obtained for AlNbO4 nanoparticles with an average size of 15–20 nm, AlNbO4 materials still have many problems, such as a poor rate capability and an initial irreversible capacity loss. The lithium ion insertion and extraction behavior of the Nb2O5–WO3 system were also investigated.98–100 Interesting results were also obtained in that niobium substitution of tungsten could accelerate lithium ion diffusion in the bulk phase.
3. Niobium oxides for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs)
Sodium-ion batteries are considered to be promising candidates for large-scale applications because of their low cost and huge availability of sodium salts. The basic principle of a sodium-ion battery is the same as that of LIBs. However, the performance reported for sodium-ion batteries is much lower than that for LIBs due to the inferior resistance between Li and Na, resulting in a low energy density and sluggish kinetics of Na-ion diffusion. Therefore, it is necessary to find a proper electrode that can provide sufficient energy/power density and cycle stability. Up to now, only one paper has reported the use of Nb2O5 as an anode for a sodium-ion battery. A composite consisting of niobium oxide and carbon delivered a reversible capacity of ∼175 mA h g−1 and provided an excellent rate performance and cycle stability for up to 300 cycles.7 The Na-ion de/intercalation mechanism in the Nb2O5 crystal structure is summarized in Fig. 12. NaxNb2O5 is formed after Na ions are inserted into Nb2O5 during the first discharge (>0.3 V vs. Na); during the discharge process at low potential (<0.3 V vs. Na), NaxNb2O5 would partially transform into NbO and Na2O, accompanied by amorphization through further sodiation. In this process, the storage of Na-ions in the amorphous NaxNb2O5 phase (x = 1.34) could be completed through capacitive reactions. The Na deintercalation reactions, which form amorphous NayNb2O5 (y = 0.28) via capacitive reactions could be completed by the subsequent charge process, whereas NbO and Na2O remain unchanged.

4. Niobium oxides for vanadium redox flow batteries
Unlike lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, vanadium redox flow batteries (VRBs) store or release energy in two separate liquid reservoirs, employing two soluble VO2+/VO2+ and V2+/V3+ redox couples in sulphuric acid as the positive and negative half-cell electroactive species, respectively. The redox chemistry is shown as follows:101–104 Positive: VO2+ + 2H+ + e− ↔ VO2+ + H2O E° = 1.0 V vs. SHE(4) Negative: V2+ ↔ V3+ + e− E° = −0.26 V vs. SHE(5) Overall: VO2+ + V2+ + 2H+ ↔ VO2+ + V3+ + H2O E° = 1.26 V(6)
In VRBs, these vanadium redox reactions take place on the surface of electrodes (e.g., graphite felt, carbon felt, or carbon paper), without structural changes, by providing only redox-active sites. However, these pristine carbon-based electrode materials demonstrate low electrochemical activity and poor kinetic reversibility, which limit the power performance of VRBs. Therefore, modification of the carbon-based materials is necessary to improve the electrocatalytic activity, for example, attaching functional groups, such as carboxylic, hydroxyl, and pyridinic nitrogen groups,105–107 on the surface, or coating (or depositing) noble metals (e.g., Pt, Au, Pd, Ir, and Ru) and metal oxides (e.g., Mn3O4, WO3, PbO2, and Nb2O5) onto carbon-based electrodes.108–111 Among these, low-cost Nb2O5 shows a promising catalytic effect in VRBs.112
Recently, Li et al.112 reported the use of Nb2O5 and W-doped Nb2O5 nanorods as electrocatalysts deposited on the surface of graphite felts (GFs) to enhance the electrochemical activity of electrodes in a VRB system. The samples were prepared by hydrothermal treatment at 170 °C for 48 h, in which the GFs were placed in a Teflon-sealed autoclave containing ammonium niobium oxalate solutions or ammonium paratungstate, followed by calcination at 500 °C in Ar. The amount, size, and distribution of the Nb2O5-based nanorod catalysts on GF surfaces were investigated. It was found that the addition of a small amount of a W source in the precursor solution could promote the precipitation of the active materials, and the obtained W-doped Nb2O5 had much smaller particle sizes and a more uniform size distribution. As demonstrated in Fig. 13b, the optimized product (i.e., W-doped Nb2O5 prepared with a 0.05 M Nb concentration in the precursor solutions, abbreviated as 0.05 M-Nb(W)) shows small nanoparticles with sizes of around 250 nm, which are composed of many nanorods uniformly distributed on GFs. The charge–discharge voltage profiles at a current density of 150 mA cm−2 for the pristine, Nb2O5-modified (0.10 M-Nb) and W-doped Nb2O5-modified (0.05 M-Nb(W)) GF electrodes are displayed in the inset of Fig. 13b. The overpotentials significantly decreased as a result of introducing Nb2O5 and W-doped Nb2O5, resulting in a lower charge voltage and a higher discharge voltage, which have a critical influence not only on the redox reaction kinetics but also on the charge transfer. AC impedance analysis confirmed that the 0.05 M-Nb(W) sample has the lowest charge transfer resistance. Compared with the pristine GF electrodes, the energy efficiency (EE) of VRBs was improved by 7.6 and 10.7% for the 0.10 M-Nb and 0.05 M-Nb(W) samples, respectively, and the 0.05 M-Nb(W) electrode delivered the highest specific discharge capacity of 14.4 Ah L−1 at 150 mA cm−2 (about 1.8 times higher than the pristine GF electrode). These results indicate that Nb2O5-based nanorods (especially for W-doped Nb2O5) offer great promise as high-performance electrocatalysts toward both VO2+/VO2+ and V2+/V3+ redox couples to enhance the electrochemical activities of the GF electrodes for VRB applications.

5. Niobium oxides for hybrid supercapacitor
Supercapacitors with high power and long durability could be promising candidates for solving the energy crisis. In electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), both positive and negative electrodes used activated carbon, which inevitably restricts their energy densities, specific capacitances and working voltage window, even though they have the advantages of a high power density and excellent cycle durability.114 Hence, it is necessary to improve the energy density of EDLCs so that they can meet the needs of commercial applications. Hybrid supercapacitors, consisting of metal–oxide positive electrodes with pseudocapacitive behavior and activated-carbon negative electrodes with EDLC behavior are an efficient way to increase the energy density of EDLCs.115 The operation mechanism of this hybrid supercapacitor is that the charge is stored in the positive electrode by a reversible non-faradaic reaction, such as with Li+ and Na+, on the surface of activated and porous carbon material, whereas a reversible faradaic reaction occurs on the metal–oxide electrode. Supercapacitors with this asymmetric configuration can accumulate charge through a faradaic redox electrochemical reaction process, which can contribute to the enhanced specific capacitance and extended working voltage window, leading to an increase in the energy density of the hybrid capacitor. This state-of-the-art hybrid supercapacitor shows an improved energy density, an excellent cycle life, and a high working voltage. RuO2 has been extensively investigated as the electrode material in hybrid supercapacitors, since it provides superior specific capacitance, cycling stability, and conductance;116 however, the high cost of this material limits its application in hybrid supercapacitors.
Recent studies demonstrated that the capacity of bulk Nb2O5 was higher than that of conventional Li4Ti5O12 at high rates, indicating that it exhibited the electrochemical features of a pseudocapactor.117 As we mentioned above, the pseudocapacitance only occurred on the surface of Nb2O5, rather than the bulk crystal. Recently, DFT calculations showed that a solid solution formed at specific sites by intercalating atoms (lithium) could donate electrons locally to its neighboring atoms, resulting in the reduction of niobium, and the nano-porous structure could be the origin of the high-rate pseudocapacitance in these pseudocapacitor materials.118 These results also showed that Nb2O5 with a nano-porous structure could improve the performance. Actually, the highest specific capacity was obtained with the orthorhombic Nb2O5 phase, among various crystal structures of Nb2O5. However, the formation of this specific structure at a high calcination temperature (>600 °C) could lead to nanoparticle aggregation. Such aggregation of Nb2O5 nanoparticles would limit application in devices that require high-power electrode materials to balance the kinetics gap between the slow faradaic anode and the fast electric double-layer-type cathode. Nanosized orthorhombic Nb2O5 was regarded as a highly advantageous material for improving the kinetics in the anode system. In spite of this merit, one of the major challenges is the synthesis of small-sized orthorhombic Nb2O5 nanoparticles. A mesoporous Nb2O5/carbon (M-Nb2O5–C) nanocomposite anode was synthesized by a simple one-pot method using a block-copolymer-assisted self-assembly,119 as shown in Fig. 14. The asymmetric CV curves (Fig. 14a and b) of these hybrid supercapacitors, using M-Nb2O5–C as electrode, clearly indicated that a faradaic reaction happened in the supercapacitor system. Besides, the linear relationship between the current and scan rates (Fig. 14c) also revealed that the surface faradaic reactions, rather than the diffusion-limited reactions, dominated the charge-storage reactions in the supercapacitor system, which delivered a high specific capacity with an excellent rate performance and cyclability (∼90% at 1000 mA g−1 after 1000 cycles) and outstanding energy and power densities (74 Wh kg−1 and 18510 W kg−1). Nb2O5@carbon core–shell nanocrystals (Nb2O5@C NCs) with controlled crystalline phases (orthorhombic (T) and pseudohexagonal (TT)) were also produced by a one-pot microemulsion method.120 The appropriate pH conditions in the water-in-oil microemulsion system play a most important role in the control of the Nb2O5 crystalline phases. Acidic and alkaline conditions led to T-Nb2O5@C and TT-Nb2O5@C NCs, respectively.
 Fig. 14  (a) CV curves of hybrid supercapacitors based on M-Nb2O5–C, M-Nb2O5, and b-Nb2O5 anodes at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1; (b) CV curves of a hybrid supercapacitor using an M-Nb2O5–C anode at various scan rates from 2 to 50 mV s−1; (c) specific peak current of hybrid supercapacitor based on an M-Nb2O5–C anode with respect to various sweep rates from 2 to 50 mV s−1; and (d) SEM image of M-Nb2O5–C.

The T-Nb2O5@C showed rapid rate capability compared to that of TT-Nb2O5@C and carbon shell-free Nb2O5 NCs due to the synergistic effects of (i) the structural advantages of T-Nb2O5 and (ii) the conductive carbon shell, which promoted high electron mobility. The obtained high performance of the T-Nb2O5@C core/shell nanocrystals indicates that combination with conducting materials could enhance the charge transfer and increase the rate capability. Therefore, ongoing research on Nb2O5 as an electrode for a supercapacitor involves combining conducting carbon materials to improve the charge transfer. T-Nb2O5/graphene and Nb2O5/CNTs exhibited excellent power densities and cycle performance.15,42,55,110,121,122 For example, a composite consisting of nano-sized Nb2O5 and highly conductive CNTs was prepared by Lu et al.;15 a T-Nb2O5/graphene nanocomposite was also successfully prepared by a hydrothermal and heat-treatment process.42 The use of graphene or carbon nanotubes as an effective conductive support could significantly improve the conductivity of the electrode, lower polarization, and enhance the power density. Both Nb2O5/CNTs and Nb2O5/graphene exhibited enhanced intercalation pseudocapacitance and excellent high rate capability. It was reported that a microporous carbide-derived carbon composite (CDC) exhibited the highest specific surface area (up to more than 3000 m2 g−1),123 therefore, a niobium pentoxide and carbide-derived carbon composite (Nb2O5/CDCs) with a layered structure was prepared by a hydrothermal method.122 Developing a facile way to prepare orthorhombic-phase niobium oxide (T-Nb2O5) is another direction in research into the use of Nb2O5 as a supercapacitor. Recently, T-Nb2O5 nanowires with an ultra-thin carbon coating were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method, and such material exhibited excellent Li+ storage ability.8 Kong et al. developed a facile and sustainable method to prepare T-Nb2O5 nanocrystals using novel nanorod-like cellulose nanocrystals (CNs) as soft templates.124 The T-Nb2O5 nanocrystals exhibited unprecedented Li+ intercalation pseudocapacitance and an excellent cycle performance.
Free-standing binder-free electrodes have been extensively used for bendable, wearable, and portable electronics. After employing these electrodes, which consist of high-capacitance components and good ionic electric conductive pathways, such devices delivered a high volumetric capacitance and provided as much energy as possible in a rather limited space. The hydrothermal reaction of Nb2O5 with 2D flexible graphene is a possible way to fabricate a free-standing Nb2O5/graphene paper electrode,9 as shown in Fig. 15. From the SEM images (Fig. 15a–f), each paper electrode consisted of compact layers and channels between layers, which can enhance the ion diffusion. Nb2O5 nanodots with an average size of 1–3 nm were uniformly dispersed on the graphene nanosheets, as shown clearly in the TEM images (Fig. 15g–i).

TiNb2O7 was also developed as an electrode material for supercapacitors.125–127 Recently, a hybrid supercapacitor consisting of porous TiNb2O7 nanotubes125 delivered a high energy density of ∼74 Wh kg−1. Madhavi et al. demonstrated that a hybrid supercapacitor with a TiNb2O7 nanofiber electrode delivered high energy (43 Wh kg−1) and power densities (3 kW kg−1), as well as a good cycle ability (84% of the initial value after 3000 cycles).128 Besides, the selectivity of the electrolyte solution is another issue concerning the application of Nb2O5 as a supercapacitor. Recent research showed that the highest capacitance and coulombic efficiency could be achieved using an electrolyte containing 1 M lithium perchlorate in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate.122
6. Niobium oxides as electrochemical support for fuel cells
Due to the importance of energy conversion and concerns about global warming and climate change caused by carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, the development of efficient and clean fuels is urgently needed and worthwhile for future generations.129–132 One way to solve this dilemma is to use hydrogen-based fuel cells.6,133 Compared to other current and conventional energy conversion systems, fuel cells are considered as a non-polluting power source that provides much higher energy efficiency and energy density as well as having the advantage of very low or even zero emissions of harmful greenhouse gases. Therefore, fuel cells have attracted a lot of interest in science and engineering.134–137 Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that convert chemical energy (such as hydrogen and methanol) into electricity by the electrochemical reaction of positively charged protons with an oxidizer (air or pure oxygen). The basic configuration of fuel cells consists of an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte. The main goal of current fuel cell technology is to reduce the costs and to deliver high performance and durability, since current fuel cell systems, which have a high cost and relatively poor durability, cannot meet the targets laid out by the Department of Energy (DOE).138–140 However, the main cost in a fuel cell system is associated with the cathode side, where sluggish oxygen-reduction reactions occur. The ongoing ways to reduce cost and improve the performance of the oxygen-reduction reaction can be generally classified as:139,141–155 (a) reduction of the catalyst loading in the fuel cell electrode while maintaining a high performance; (b) development of a metal alloy with a different morphology and high performance to reduce platinum loading; (c) reduction of the catalyst particle size to expose a larger surface area for the oxygen reduction reaction; (d) development of non-noble-metal catalysts, such as nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus-doped carbon materials, such as porous carbon, carbon nanotubes, and graphene; (e) development of transition-metal oxides and carbon composites as low-cost catalysts; and (f) improvement of the performance of carbon-based electrochemical supports and development of new non-carbon catalyst support materials, such as metal oxides, nitrides or carbides. As clean energy systems, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have been extensively studied during the past two decades.129,156–158 Although these two promising devices have achieved significant progress and could be commercially available for vehicles (Toyota Mirai, Honda FCX Clarity and Hyundai Tucson Fuel Cells), the chargers and other portable devices, the high costs (mainly from the catalyst), and the durability issues still limit their large-scale application. Compared with other catalysts, platinum provides the benefits of high catalytic activity, chemical stability in acid solution, high exchange current density and superior performance;159 therefore, high-cost platinum and platinum-based alloys are common catalysts in PEMFCs and DMFCs. It is essential to reduce the platinum loading and to improve the efficiency of PEMFCs and DMFCs. Compared to bulk metal catalysts without supporting materials, it is well known that nano-sized platinum catalysts supported by other materials are effective in improving stability and performance.160 Good electrochemical support, especially when it can provide good interaction between the catalyst and the support, could improve the efficiency of the catalyst and reduce catalyst loading. In addition, it can modify the energy levels of electrons in platinum, leading to a sufficiently improved catalyst performance and durability. Moreover, it can reduce catalyst poisoning (such as carbon monoxide), and in some cases, it affects the catalyst particle size.161,162 For example, the particle size of platinum on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) is much smaller than that on pure carbon nanotubes, although these two types of carbon nanotubes exhibited almost the same surface area and the mass loading of platinum was the same.163 The strong connection between platinum and N-CNTs results in a smaller platinum particle size on N-CNTs, which can significantly improve the performance and cycle durability compared to platinum on CNTs. Therefore, the support material selection is crucial in determining the behavior, performance, life and cost-effectiveness of whole fuel cells. Currently, carbon black (e.g. XC-72) with a high surface area is the commonly used catalyst support for both the anodes and cathodes in fuel-cell technology. However, aggregation of the catalytic metal nanoparticles resulting from weak interactions between the carbon-based electrochemical support materials and the catalytic noble metal nanoparticles could decrease the active surface area after long-term operation.164 More importantly, both electrochemical carbon corrosion resulting from reaction with the HO2− radical, which was formed as an intermediate oxygen reduction species, and dissolution of the active noble metal elements under normal operating conditions, were accelerated at high operation potentials. Some carbon materials (carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, graphene and carbon nanocages) with a higher graphitic component exhibited desirable corrosion resistance.165–171 Nevertheless, no matter how high the graphitic component in the carbon-based materials, carbon can still be oxidative under the operation conditions (high operation voltage and oxidative atmosphere at the cathode side) and this could become worse at the time of start-up or it could even turn off the fuel cell due to a much higher operation voltage (∼1.4 V or higher).129 Highly chemically stable conducting metal oxides, such as titania, tungsten oxide, alumina, niobia, ceria, silica, zirconia, and indium oxide, were developed as effective electrochemical supports for fuel cells; they can not only prevent carbon corrosion but can also introduce a synergistic co-catalytic effect between the noble metal and the conducting metal–oxide support.10,151,152,172 Compared with carbon-based materials, the noble metal could be deposited more uniformly and with a smaller particle size on metal oxides due to the strong connection between the noble metal and conducting oxides. Our recent research clearly shows that the average particle size of platinum on a niobium-doped titanium oxide electrochemical support was much smaller than that on the surface of pure carbon nanotubes.161
Recently, niobium doped titanium oxides and tin oxides have been widely used as conductive metal oxide electrochemical supports due to their excellent electron conductivities (doping Nb5+ into TiO2 or SnO2 can donate electrons to the conduction band), excellent chemical stability and high corrosion resistance in various electrolytic media, including strong acid solution.173–175 Stoichiometric Nb2O5 with a band gap of 3.4 eV is a pure insulator and electronic conductor, which could be essential after introducing Nb4+ ions and can be generated by creating oxygen deficiencies by heating Nb2O5 in a reducing atmosphere at high temperatures.12 Another possible way is combining carbon black. Sasaki et al. firstly used niobia (Nb2O5 and NbO2) as an electrochemical support for the ORR,155 and Pt/NbO2/C electrocatalysts with ultra-low platinum loading showed a superior ORR performance compared with a commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst. Platinum nanoparticles supported on carbon black, decorated with a niobium oxide phase, were also prepared for the ORR. It was found that hydrophilic NbxOy-composite materials have lower intrinsic catalytic activity for oxygen reduction but offer better overall platinum mass utilization.176 Therefore, the improved ORR performance after employing niobia as a support encourages us to investigate the mechanism of how the niobia affects the platinum, so that we can optimize the catalyst design. Electron density transfer from the d-orbitals of the metal to unoccupied p-orbitals of oxygen is commonly observed in metal–metal oxides, resulting in the formation of platinum–oxide. The reduced number of unoccupied p-orbitals of O at the metal–metal oxide interface could lead to weak Pt–O bonding, resulting in a fast oxygen reduction reaction. Zhang et al. showed that the binding energy of Pt–O has a strong dependence on the oxidation state of the support surface. Therefore, Pt on NbO exhibited a smoother surface than Pt on NbO2 and Nb2O5 due to stronger binding of Pt at the NbO interface.177 Therefore, Pt supported by NbO and NbO2 enhances the specific electrocatalytic activity compared with Pt on glassy carbon. Sasaki also thought that the superior mass activity of Pt/NbO2/C could be ascribed to the reduced OH adsorption, which was caused by lateral repulsion between PtOH and the oxide surface species.155 However, the high temperature (generally 1000 °C) for the phase transformation of Nb2O5 to NbO2 could lead to a larger particle size for NbO2, which will limit the application of NbO2 as an electrochemical support. Recently, a conducting NbO2 phase was achieved at temperatures as low as 700 °C by firstly activating niobium oxide with a carbon coating.16 Zhang et al. also used radio frequency magnetron sputtering to deposit NbO2 on CNT arrays.10Fig. 16e shows images of NbO2 on the CNT array. The CNTs were almost covered by NbO2 (NbO2/CNTs); after depositing Pt on the NbO2/CNTs, almost no decrease in the electrochemical surface area and oxygen reduction reaction for the Pt/NbO2/CNT catalyst was observed after as many as 10000 cycles (Fig. 16c and d). However, a significant reduction in the ECSA (Fig. 16a) and the ORR (Fig. 16b) was observed for the Pt/CNT catalysts.

A one-dimensional niobium oxide electrochemical support also provides the benefits of a high surface area and easy gas diffusion in fuel cell technologies. Nanopillar and nanofiber niobium oxides were fabricated by glancing angle deposition (GLAD)178 and electrospinning technologies,179 respectively. After post-heat treatment at a high annealing temperature under a reductive atmosphere, the insulator, Nb2O5, could be converted into conductive NbO and NbO2. An electrochemical performance test showed that the niobium–oxide supports could be stable under aggressive electrochemical testing (up to 1.4 V vs. RHE). As an electrochemical support, NbOx and a nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheet composite with a sandwich-like structure has been designed for direct oxygen reduction reaction.180 The enhanced ORR and high methanol tolerance could be attributed to the active oxygen vacancy in NbOx and the synergistic coupling effect resulting from strong contact between NbOx and the nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets.
The poisoning of platinum active sites by strong absorption of a CO intermediate is another critical problem associated with the practical operation of fuel cells. This poisoning behavior will hinder further oxidation of methanol, resulting in a high onset potential at the anode side, which will significantly decrease the power densities of our fuel cells. The strong connection between platinum and metal oxide can not only change the energy level of d orbits in platinum, which could decrease the absorption of a CO intermediate on platinum active sites, but can also provide extra OH– functional groups in acid solution, which can be used to remove CO intermediates quickly so as to increase the kinetics of methanol oxidation. Therefore, many oxides, such as TiO2, WO3, ZrO2, CeO2, SnO2 and Nb2O5, were used as effective electrochemical supporting materials in fuel cells.151,152,161,164,181–183 Compared with other oxides, niobium-based oxides have the advantages of excellent chemical stability in acid conditions, high intrinsic catalytic activity and high oxygen storage capacity. Furthermore, niobium-based oxides exhibited an excellent synergistic effect in metal–metal oxide systems due to their well-known strong metal support interactions. Thus, it is expected that niobium-based oxides can provide mobile surface oxygen species to the noble metal surface by spillover effects to facilitate electro-oxidation of adsorbed CO or CO intermediates.184–187 However, the low electronic conductivity of Nb2O5 also limits its application in methanol oxidation or formic acid oxidation. As with improving the electronic conductivities of Nb2O5 in LIBs and SCs, a general and effective method is introducing or combining it with carbon. Chun et al. investigated the effect of introducing Nb2O5 nanoparticles onto carbon-supported platinum to facilitate the electrochemical kinetics of CO and methanol oxidation.188 Their results indicated that introducing niobium oxide into carbon-supported platinum can enhance the catalytic activity due to a bifunctional mechanism, in which Nb2O5 not only modified the electronic structure of platinum but also donated surface mobile oxygen by a spillover effect to Pt–CO absorbents, resulting in low oxidation potential. The electrochemical oxidation of ethanol is an 8-electron transfer reaction if the ethanol can be fully oxidized to carbon dioxide. Therefore, the splitting of the C–C bond in ethanol is crucial for the high activity of the electrochemical oxidation of ethanol. Pt-Nb2O5/carbon provided a more favorable environment for the ethanol oxidation process due to strong intrinsic metal–oxide interactions, which can provide an extra OH– group. However, this catalyst is still quite limited with respect to splitting the C–C bond. Recent research clearly showed that a larger Pt–NbOx interfacial surface area in NbxRuyO-supported Pt could be more effective with respect to splitting the C–C bond in acid electrolyte solution, although the kinetics of ethanol oxidation were relatively slower than for reference samples.189,190 Actually, a unique catalytic behavior could be observed in the oxidation of CO and the dehydrogenation of much larger molecules when Pt nanoparticles were present on the reduced NbOx subspecies. Pt and Pt–Pb-based nanoparticles supported by mesoporous highly crystalline niobium oxide–carbon composites were developed by a one-pot synthesis method,11 as shown in Fig. 17. The dimensions, such as pore size and wall thickness, were controlled by simply varying the block-copolymer molecular weight or block weight fraction due to the structure-directing properties of the block-copolymer. The mesoporosity can prevent particle agglomeration and provide uniformly dispersed nanoparticles. A mesostructured material, CCM–NbO2–C–Pt–Pb, which was prepared by this one-pot synthesis method, showed excellent electrochemical activity toward formic acid oxidation.

7. Outlook and future work
As a chemically stable, low-cost and environmentally friendly product, niobium-based oxides could be extensively used in LIBs, NIBs, SCs, VRBs and fuel cells, as summarized in Fig. 18. Their distinguished electrochemical performance (high capacitance for SCs, excellent cycle and rate performance for LIBs and NIBs) and high corrosion resistance under practical fuel-cell operation conditions could make them promising electrodes or electrochemical support materials for widespread industrial applications in batteries and fuel cell technologies. Their higher potential windows can prevent the formation of lithium dendrites and their specific lithium-ion-insertion behaviour keeps the crystal structure stable during charge–discharge processes, which makes them promising electrodes for LIBs. Compared with other transition-metal–oxide, Nb2O5 delivered a high capacitance and an excellent cycling performance because it can avoid agglomeration, thus increasing the surface area exposed to electrolyte. Meanwhile, the wide potential window for Nb2O5 as a supercapacitor results in a high energy density. The unique chemical stability and conductivity of modified niobium oxides under acid conditions (most transition metal oxides are not stable under acid conditions) would provide an effective and promising way to solve the dilemma of degradation under practical operating conditions in fuel cells. However, the low ion and electron conductivities, low surface area (resulting from a high annealing temperature) and relatively high-temperature synthesis methods still pose significant challenges for practical industry application. On the other hand, these disadvantages also give us directions for future work.
 Fig. 18  Summary of the applications of niobium-based oxides. 
(1) A facile, low cost and environmentally friendly synthetic approach is necessary for realizing the large-scale production of niobium-based oxide nanostructures.
(2) Developing a new material design to make full utilization of the electrode materials can achieve the ultimate goals of high energy and power densities.
(3) A unique architecture for a 3D current collector can facilitate easy penetration of the electrolyte solution into the electrode, which can ensure that the ions are accessible to regions far beyond the surface.
(4) There is still a need to fully understand the relationship between niobium-based oxide nanostructures and their electrochemical behaviour (e.g. the kinetics of charge transfer and ion diffusion at the electrode/electrolyte interface), which can assist future optimization of the synthesis parameters and material properties.
(5) Since platinum nanoparticles could not be easily deposited on a smaller electrochemical support, 0D conducting oxides with a smaller particle size could not meet the requirements for the electrochemical support although they could have a high surface area; therefore, preparing highly conductive and high-surface-area niobium-based oxides with 1D or 2D structures (e.g. nanosheets, nanotubes or nanorods) could be a possible solution towards an effective electrochemical support in fuel cell technologies.
