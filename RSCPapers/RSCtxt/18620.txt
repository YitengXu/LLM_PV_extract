    , Accepted 7th July 2019First published on 10th July 2019AbstractThe halide double perovskites Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 form a complete solid solution. The cubic Fmm space group symmetry and near complete rock salt ordering of Ag+ and Bi3+ are retained for all compositions, and the lattice parameter varies linearly between the two end-members. The band gap increases linearly between Cs2AgBiBr6 (Eg = 2.19 eV) and Cs2AgBiBrCl5 (Eg = 2.61 eV), but deviates upward from a Vegard's Law behavior once the chloride content exceeds ∼85%. The Cs2AgBiCl6 end-member has a band gap, Eg = 2.77 eV, that is 0.10 eV larger than the extrapolated value from a Vegard's Law fit. Analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction peak shapes shows that microstrain increases steadily as the Cl− content increases, before dropping precipitously for the Cs2AgBiCl6 end-member. The combined results give no evidence for long range ordering of halide ions.
Introduction
Halide perovskites with the general formula ABX3 (A = Cs+, CH3NH3+; B = Pb2+, Sn2+, Ge2+; X = I−, Br−, Cl−) have been widely studied for use in a variety of optoelectronic applications, most notably as the absorbing layer in photovoltaic cells.1–5 Inorganic halide double perovskites with formula A2BIBIIIX6 (A = Cs+, Rb+; BI = Ag+, K+, Na+, Li+; BIII = Bi3+, Sb3+, In3+; X = I−, Br−, Cl−) are site-ordered variants of the perovskite structure that exhibit an alternating (rock salt) pattern of BI and BIII ions on the octahedral sites. Double perovskites are attractive because they do not contain the toxic Pb2+ ion and offer enhanced chemical and thermal stability, particularly with respect to the tin and germanium halide perovskites. While many A2BIBIIICl6 double perovskites can be prepared, very few examples of bromide and iodide analogues have been reported, Cs2AgBiBr6 being the most notable exception.6 The lack of iodide double perovskites, which hold the promise for sub 2 eV band gaps, has limited their use in solar cells. Nevertheless, a photovoltaic cell with a power conversion efficiency of 2.5% has been reported for Cs2AgBiBr6.7 The wider band gaps of double perovskites appear to be more suitable for tandem solar cells. For that application, and others, the ability to tune the band gap of the absorbing layers is essential to match energy levels of the device components.8 In this work, we report on a facile method to tune the band gap of the double perovskite solid solution, Cs2AgBiBr6–xClx, by halide substitution.
Experimental
With the exception of AgCl, all reagents were commercially purchased and used without modification. Reagents included HCl (Fisher Scientific, 37%), HBr (Sigma Aldrich, 47%), HI (Sigma Aldrich, 47+%), H3PO2 (Sigma Aldrich, 50%), Bi2O3 (J. T. Baker, 99%), BiI3 (Sigma Aldrich, 99%), AgBr (Alfa Aesar, 99.5%), AgI (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%), CsCl (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%), CsBr (Alfa Aesar, 99%), CsI (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%), PbCl2 (Alfa Aesar, 99%), and PbBr2 (Alfa Aesar, 98+%). AgCl was synthesized on a gram scale via a precipitation reaction between KCl (Fisher Scientific, 99.8%) and AgNO3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%). The resulting white product was washed three times with deionized H2O and dried overnight via vacuum filtration; the filter flask was covered with aluminum foil to prevent photoreduction of Ag(I) into Ag(0).
The double perovskites, Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgBiCl6, were synthesized following a modified procedure from the literature.6 For a 2.00 gram synthesis, 18.0 mL of concentrated HCl and 2.0 mL of H3PO2 (18.0 mL of concentrated HBr and 2.0 mL of H3PO2) were heated to 120 °C. To this solution, 1.26 mmol of Bi2O3 (0.942 mmol of Bi2O3) and 2.51 mmol of AgCl (1.88 mmol of AgBr) were added. The acid was stirred for 15 minutes to allow the reagents to dissolve, forming a homogeneous solution. 5.03 mmol of CsCl (3.77 mmol of CsBr) was then added, immediately triggering the precipitation of the desired perovskite with near unity yield. The final product mass to initial solution volume ratio was kept at 1.00 g of perovskite to 10.0 mL of acid solution throughout all experiments. The resulting precipitate was collected on filter paper, washed with neat ethanol three times, and dried overnight via vacuum filtration.
The solid solutions, Cs2AgBiBr6–xClx [nominally x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5], were prepared via the solid-state synthesis from the end-members. Appropriate molar ratios (5:1, 4:2, 3:3, 2:4, 1.5:4.5, 1:5, and 0.5:5.5) of the double perovskite end-members were ground for 20 minutes with an agate mortar and pestle in an argon-filled glove box. The samples were then placed in covered alumina crucibles and heated in a box furnace in air at 200 °C for 18 hours. One cycle of heating was sufficient to produce homogeneous solid solutions.
Purity of all compounds was confirmed using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD); no secondary phases were detected. Synthesis of the solid solutions annealed at 200 °C for 18 hours produced powders that were easily ground, with colors ranging from hunter orange to pale yellow, depending on the ratio of the starting materials.
Solid state synthesis of an iodide containing double perovskite phase, Cs2AgBiBr6–xIx, was attempted at a variety of halide ratios (x = 3, 2, 1, 0.33). Direct synthesis from binary starting materials yielded a mixture of undesired products (AgX and Cs3Bi2X9 [X = Br, I]) without the appearance of a perovskite phase, while syntheses from the Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite and appropriate binary iodide reagents yielded a slight increase in the perovskite lattice constant with respect to Cs2AgBiBr6, but significant amounts of the Cs3Bi2I9 and AgBr phases were always present in the PXRD patterns. Attempts to determine the iodide solubility in Cs2AgBiBr6–xIx and/or the shift in band gap were frustrated by the presence of Cs3Bi2I9 (Eg = 2.1 eV) whose diffraction peaks overlap significantly with the double perovskite phase. It would appear as though there is little to no iodide solubility in the bromide end-member.
PXRD data were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer (40 kV, 40 mA, sealed Cu X-ray tube) equipped with an incident beam monochromator (Johansson type SiO2-crystal) and a Lynxeye XE-T position sensitive detector. Rietveld refinements of laboratory PXRD data were carried out using the TOPAS-Academic (Version 6) software package to determine the crystal structure.9 A Rigaku MiniFlex II benchtop powder X-ray diffractometer (30 kV, 15 mA, sealed Cu X-ray tube, with a NaI scintillation detector) was used for initial phase identification. Search/Match routines were performed using the Materials Data, Inc., software Jade.10
UV-visible diffuse reflectance data were collected from 178 nm to 890 nm with an Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrometer equipped with a Toshiba TCD1304AP (3648-element linear silicon CCD array). The spectrometer was used with an Ocean Optics DH-2000-BAL deuterium and halogen UV-vis-NIR light source and a 400 μm R400-7-ANGLE-VIS reflectance probe. The detector was calibrated using a Spectralon diffuse reflectance standard.
Results
The PXRD patterns of the Cs2AgBiBr6−xClx samples across the entire series are shown in Fig. 1. All solid solution members adopt the cubic double perovskite structure with Fmm space group symmetry. A representative example of a Rietveld refinement of the Cs2AgBiBr3Cl3 composition is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).

The refined cubic lattice parameters of the solid solution members were examined as a function of the nominal anion composition. A linear increase of the lattice occurred as the bromide ion content increased, in accordance with Vegard's Law, as shown in Fig. 2, indicating the anion contents were close to the nominal values expected from the starting ratios of the two end-members. When the anion site occupancy was refined in the Rietveld analysis of the PXRD data, chloride occupancies within a few percent of the nominal values were obtained (Table S2, ESI†).

Notice in Fig. 1 that the Bragg peaks in the PXRD patterns are broader for the samples with a mixture of halide ions than they are for the end-members. To determine if this is due to microstrain or crystallite size effects, the peak broadening was analyzed using TOPAS-Academic (Version 6).9 Instrumental broadening was estimated from the PXRD spectrum of the Cs2AgBiBr6 end-member, whose peak widths were comparable to calibration standards, indicating minimal size or strain broadening. For the remaining samples the peak shape and axial divergence parameters were fixed at the values obtained from the Cs2AgBiBr6 refinement, and the additional broadening was modelled using the microstrain and crystallite size macros. Using this approach, it was determined that nearly all the sample broadening could be attributed to microstrain broadening, primarily Gaussian in nature, so the refinements were carried out with no crystallite size broadening. Full details are given in the ESI.† A substantial improvement in the fit is seen when microstrain broadening is included, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†).
The microstrain values as a function of chloride ion content are plotted in Fig. 3. The strain rises in a near linear fashion as the Cl− content increases before dropping precipitously for Cs2AgBiCl6. Microstrain is a measure of the variation in unit cell dimensions throughout the sample. Alloys tend to have a higher microstrain than pure compounds because of the random distribution of atoms/ions of different sizes, which makes it easy to rationalize why the end-members have much less strain than the solid solutions. It's more difficult to understand why chloride-rich samples have more microstrain than bromide-rich samples. Perhaps squeezing a larger anion (Br−) into a lattice made up mostly of smaller anions (Cl−) disrupts the crystal packing to a greater extent than the reverse scenario.

To determine its optical band gap a UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS) was collected for each sample prepared (Fig. S2, ESI†). The end-member compounds exhibit indirect band gaps, as determined by previous experimental and computational analyses.6,11–13 The absorption onsets seen in the intermediate members of the solid solution had similar slopes to the end-members, and therefore, were assumed to be indirect band gap materials as well.
To extract optical band gaps, the DRS spectra were transformed to pseudoabsorption spectra via the Kubelka–Munk (KM) equation:  where α is the optical absorption coefficient and R is the reflectance. This equation allows the absorbance of a material to be estimated from its reflectance. The KM plots for the solid solution series are shown in Fig. 4. The Tauc method was applied to the transformed data to estimate the band gaps of these samples. For an indirect band gap semiconductor, the equation [F(R)hν]1/2 is used to extract band gaps. The band gap values obtained in this manner are given in Table S3 (ESI†) and plotted as a function of composition in Fig. 5. The asymmetric absorbance peak that lies 0.6–0.7 eV above the band gap is thought to arise due to localized Bi 6s2 → 6s16p1 transitions.14

Tuning the band gap by forming solid solutions, so-called band gap engineering, is a powerful tool for optimizing the absolute band positions of semiconductors for use various optoelectronic devices, including tandem solar cells. As shown in Fig. 5 the band gap of Cs2AgBiBr6−xClx perovskites increases linearly with increasing Cl− content until x ≈ 5. The band gap of the Cs2AgBiCl6 end-member is larger by 0.10 eV than predicted from extrapolation of the linear fit to the samples between x = 0 and x = 5. This is contrary to the trends seen in the CH3NH3PbBr3−xClx and CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx series, where the band gap follows Vegard's Law across the entire solid solution.15 The energy of the localized Bi 6s2 → 6s16p1 transition also shifts to higher energy as the Cl− content increases, by a similar amount as the band gap (see Fig. S3, ESI†). It is consistently 0.6–0.8 eV higher in energy than the band gap. Unlike the band gap the increase in the energy of this transition is nearly linear across the entire series.
Band structure calculations on these materials show that the valence to conduction band transition can be described as a transition from filled halogen nonbonding p-orbitals to empty antibonding orbitals with significant bismuth 6p character.6,11 Not surprisingly, as the content of the more electronegative chloride ion increases the valence band energy is lowered and the band gap increases (Table S3, ESI†). The reasons behind the deviation of the chloride end-member from Vegard's Law are hard to identify with certainty. However, it is worth noting that the deviation from Vegard's Law occurs when the Cl− ion content exceeds 80–85%, close to the composition where it becomes statistically impossible to include at least one bromide ion in every BiX6 octahedron.
Conclusions
The halide double perovskites Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6 form a complete solid solution. Attempts to prepare Cs2AgBiBr6−xIx were unsuccessful. The Cs2AgBiBr6−xClx lattice parameter follows Vegard's Law across the entire solid solution, while the band gap does so from Cs2AgBiBr6 to approximately Cs2AgBiBrCl5. The band gap deviates upward from a linear Vegard's Law fit for the most chloride-rich compositions. No signs of anion ordering are seen for any composition in the solid solution. The ability to tune the band gaps and absolute band positions of these systems facilitates integration of halide double perovskites into optoelectronic devices.
