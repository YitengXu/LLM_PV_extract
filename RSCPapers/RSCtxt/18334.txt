    , Accepted 8th April 2019First published on 9th April 2019AbstractThe interfacial defect states between the active layer and the charge transport layer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the main channels of energy loss, which can result in carrier recombination loss and then limit the efficiency and stability of devices. In this study, the luminescent organic small molecule material tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) was inserted between CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and the electron transport layer PCBM as an interface modification layer. As a result, DBP-based PSCs attained the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.61%, obviously higher than 14.26% of the reference device. The enhanced PCE was attributed to the multifunctional synergistic effect of DBP. DBP not only behaves as an efficient interface modification layer to passivate the perovskite defects and improve the energy level alignment, thereby reducing carrier recombination losses at the interface, but also plays a role as a CH3NH3PbI3 absorption spectrum modification layer by Föster energy transfer and thus enhances the light absorption of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer in the near-infrared region. Moreover, the hydrophobic and passivation effects of DBP improve the air-, thermal- and photo-stability of the PSCs. This study demonstrates the use of multifunctional organic luminescent molecules as an interfacial engineering material is a highly useful and facile method for improving the performance of planar perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Over the past several years, organic–inorganic halide hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been extensively investigated, and to date, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has exceeded 23%.1 Their high efficiency is related to the intrinsic nature, including high absorption coefficient, low exciton binding energy, high charge-carrier mobility, bipolar carrier transport, and bandgap tunability, of the perovskite materials.2 The initial device structure of the PSCs depends on a mesoporous layer that requires high-temperature preparation, which limits the practical application of PSCs. Consequently, planar heterojunction PSCs prepared by a low-temperature solution method were developed. Their fabrication process is not only relatively simple and low cost, but also suitable for the preparation of large-area flexible devices. Therefore, this type of structure has been recognized as a promising alternative for efficient photovoltaics.3–5
It is recognized that crystalline quality of the perovskite active layer is critical for achieving high PCE. Despite the prominent advantages of the current solution processing method for the perovskite preparation, it easily begets some defect states on the surface and at the grain boundaries of the perovskite layer, acting as carrier recombination centers and thus greatly limiting the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of PSCs. Moreover, the weak grain boundaries easily lead to the infiltration of moisture and oxygen into the perovskite, also act as high-speed channels for the rapid diffusion of atomic, ionic, and molecular species, thus harming the stability of devices.6–8 Therefore, defect passivation is very important for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs simultaneously.
It had been proved that introducing polymer or organic small materials into the contact interface of the perovskite is an effective strategy to reduce the defect states at the surface and grain boundaries of a perovskite to realize high-performance PSCs.9,10 For example, Wang et al. demonstrated that inserting a tunneled polystyrene (PS) layer between the perovskite and electron transport layer (ETL) could significantly improve device performance by suppressing carrier recombination. The thin PS layer also protects the perovskite layer from water and moisture damage.11 Zhang et al. reported that the insertion of a thin insulating poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) between the perovskite and p-doped hole transport layer (HTL) could also significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. A steady-state PCE of 20.3% was achieved accompanied with the negligible hysteresis by passivating trap-assisted interfacial recombination and suppressing current leakage at the perovskite layer/HTL interface.12 Huang et al. suggested that the passivation of ionic defects using quaternary ammonium halides is a general approach to remarkably improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs by passivating both types of charged ionic defect.13 Han et al. proposed another strategy for defect passivation in perovskite films using an organic dye (AQ310) and achieved an enhanced average efficiency of 19.43%, demonstrating that organic dyes with a –COOH group are commonly suitable for use as passivators in perovskites.14 Li et al. exhibited an unusual seamlessly bonded carbon nanotube@graphene (CNT@G) as a carbon composite interlayer in PSCs to realize a PCE of 19.56% due to efficient carrier extraction, faster charge transport, and restrained carrier recombination, as well as acheiving good thermal and water stability due to the increased capability to block ion/molecule diffusion.15 Wang et al. used an ionic liquid 1-alkyl-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium (RATZ) as a cation additive in the perovskite precursor solution to achieve a maximum PCE of 20.03%. Moreover, the self-assembled monolayer formation of water-soluble triazolium ionic liquid on a hydrophilic perovskite surface made the device (MA/RATZ PSCs) exhibit good humidity, and good thermal and photostability.16
Based on the existing investigations,9–16 it was found that the interface engineering plays three main roles: one is to passivate the defect states of the perovskite and then to reduce the recombination loss of charge carriers; the second is to adjust the energy level alignment between the perovskite layer and the charge transport layer for better carrier transport; and the third is to protect the active layer from damage from the unfavorable environment to improve the stability of PSCs. In this work, we incorporated a luminescent organic small molecule tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) ultrathin layer into the perovskite/ETL interface in an inverted planar heterojunction PSCs. DBP has been well investigated as a donor material in organic solar cells17–20 and as a red fluorescent dopant in organic light-emitting diodes.21 Our research revealed that DBP also is an efficient interface modification layer to passivate perovskite defects and to improve the energy level alignment, thus reducing the carrier recombination at the interface. In the meantime, hydrophobic DBP can effectively prevent water vapor from entering the perovskite layer, thereby improving the stability of the device. More interestingly, DBP can behave as a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite absorption spectrum modification layer. The CH3NH3PbI3 layer usually has weak absorption in long wavelength region of more than 550 nm. Coincidentally, DBP has very suitable absorption and fluorescent spectra,21 thereby it can absorb the remaining light across the perovskite, and thus is excited. Subsequently, the excited DBP transfers it energy to the perovskite by a Förster-type transfer, and thereby it can compensate for the insufficient absorption of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite in the near-infrared region. Benefiting from the multifunctional DBP, CH3NH3PbI3-based PSCs attained an average PCE of 15.61%, clearly higher than 14.26% of the reference device, and exhibited better air-, thermal-, and photostability. This work provides a novel and effective strategy to fabricate PSCs simultaneously with high efficiency and stability.
Results and discussion
To investigate the influence of DBP on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, planar inverted PSCs were fabricated with the device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/DBP/PCBM/Bphen/Ag. The perovskite active layer of CH3NH3PbI3 was deposited by a one-step method.22 PEDOT:PSS and PC61BM were selected as the hole-transport layer (HTL) and electron-transport layer (ETL), respectively. Bphen was used as the cathode interfacial buffer layer. To evaluate the role of DBP at the perovskite/ETL interface, control devices without DBP layer were also designed and fabricated. Here, the DBP precursor solution was fabricated by dissolving DBP in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and chlorobenzene (CB) with different concentrations, respectively, and the samples were named as THF–DBP and CB–DBP hereafter. Fig. 1a shows the structure of the experimental devices along with the molecular structure of DBP.

The photovoltaic performances of the DBP devices were characterized and the corresponding statistical photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1, where the performance parameters of the control devices are also listed for comparison. Fig. 1b shows the J–V curves of the best devices made with the optimized concentration of DBP in different solvents under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2). It was found that the performance of the DBP device was highly sensitive to the DBP concentration. The optimized concentration of DBP in both solvents was 2 mg ml−1. Clearly, the PCEs of the DBP devices showed an improvement compared with the control devices, ascribed to the significant enhancement in Jsc and the slight improvement in Voc. Enhancements of 8.5% and 9.5% in average PCE were obtained for the THF–DBP and CB–DBP devices, respectively. As can be seed from Table S1 (ESI†), the introduction of only one solvent, i.e., THF or CB, did not have much impact on the efficiency of the devices, that is, the enhancement of PCE was mainly caused by DBP. Fig. 1c presents the J–V curves in forward and reverse scans for the THF–DBP device. A similar characterization for the CB–DBP device was also done, see Fig. S1 (ESI†). It can be seen that there was substantially no hysteresis effect for each kind of DBP device. Fig. 1d shows the steady-state PCEs of the devices for each kind measured at the maximum power output point under continuous light illumination. It can be seen that the steady-state PCEs of the DBP devices were significantly higher than that of the control device, which confirms the accuracy of our efficiency characterization and also verifies the weak photocurrent hysteresis for DBP devices. Fig. 1e and f show the histograms of PCE distribution over 30 devices with the optimal DBP concentration of 2 mg ml−1 in both solvents, while more detailed information can be obtained from Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†). As can be seen from these results, the PCE of devices with the DBP layer were significantly higher, and had similar reproducibility to the control devices.

To exclude the influence of spin-coating DBP on the crystallinity of the underlying perovskite film, the perovskite films with and without DBP deposition were evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements. It can be seen from Fig. 2a that the intensity of the characteristic diffraction peaks of the perovskite show no obvious variation with the addition of DBP. However, the full widths at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peaks are slightly smaller for the perovskite/CB–DBP films than those of the perovskite film or perovskite/THF–DBP film (0.13° vs. 0.14°, corresponding to the (110) crystal plane). Therefore, the crystallinity of the perovskite modified with CB–DBP was slightly better than that of the pure perovskite and perovskite/THF–DBP films. Through the top-view SEM images shown in Fig. 2b–d, it was found that the average grain size of perovskite/CB–DBP was about 10% larger than that of the perovskite/THF–DBP or perovskite, as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), which is well consistent with the results of the XRD measurements. The different effects of CB–DBP from THF–DBP may be due to the different polarities of THF and CB. The better crystalline quality of the perovskite modified with CB–DBP should be the reason why CB–DBP led to a larger improvement in PCE than THF–DBP (9.5% vs. 8.5%).

Fig. 3a shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the control and DBP devices, which reflect the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, which is related with the optical absorption ability and the electrical properties of devices. It was found that the integrated current densities from the measured EQE spectra were 18.41 mA cm−2 (no DBP), 19.93 mA cm−2 (THF–DBP), and 20.12 mA cm−2 (CB–DBP), respectively, which were very close to the corresponding Jsc values of 19.59 mA cm−2, 21.23 mA cm−2, and 21.32 mA cm−2, as extracted from the J–V curves. To clarify the DBP effect, the differences of EQEs between the control and DBP devices are shown in Fig. 3b. From Fig. 3b, it can be seen that the EQEs of the DBP devices are superior to that of the control device over the entire spectrum region. In particular, it can be noted that the EQE spectra of the devices with DBP were clearly more enhanced in the near-infrared region. To explore the cause of the EQE improvement, the perovskite films with and without DBP deposition were evaluated by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 4a, the light absorption of the perovskite films with DBP was also enhanced over the entire spectrum region. To gain a more intuitive understanding, the absorption and emission spectra of the DBP film and the absorption difference between perovskite films with and without DBP are shown in Fig. 4b. It was found that the absorption band of DBP was located at 500–650 nm, while its emission band was located at 650–830 nm with an emission peak at 700 nm, which well overlapped with the absorption spectrum of the perovskite. Therefore, DBP can absorb the remaining visible light across the perovskite to then become excited. Subsequently, the excited DBP transfers it energy to the perovskite by a Förster-type transfer, hence increasing the light absorption of the perovskite active layer in the near-infrared wavelength. In particular, one can find an obvious absorption enhancement peak at 790 nm in Fig. 4b, which could be from the absorption of the charge transfer compound between the perovskite and DBP. Therefore, we speculated that there are two very possible mechanisms for the absorption enhancement of the perovskite film with DBP: (1) the inherent absorption of DBP, which should be responsible for the absorption enhancement in the wavelength band of less than 650 nm; (2) the re-absorption of the perovskite owing to the Förster energy transfer between the excited DBP molecule and the perovskite (see Fig. 4f), which could lead to the absorption enhancement of the perovskite in near-infrared of more than 650 nm. The latter may be the reason that the EQEs are increased remarkably in the region of more than 700 nm for the DBP devices.

In order to further reveal the origin of EQE enhancement throughout the whole spectrum for the DPB device, the steady-state and a transient photoluminance (PL) spectra of three types of perovskite films without PCBM deposition were measured at the excitations of 467 and 376 nm, respectively. The PL decay spectra were fitted by a bi-exponential decay function of I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2),23 where τ1 and τ2 are fast and slow decay lifetimes, and A1 and A2 are the corresponding weight fractions, respectively. We note from Fig. 4c that the steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite with DBP are significantly enhanced. As shown in Fig. 4d and Table S2 (ESI†), the bare perovskite film has a fast-decay lifetime of τ1 = 28.73 ns and a slow-decay lifetime of τ2 = 94.54 ns with weight fractions of 53.25% and 46.75%, respectively. After DBP deposition, τ1 is shortened to 20.85 or 17.82 ns with weight fractions of 17.73% or 9.36%, while τ2 is lengthened to 116.21 or 121.54 ns with weight fractions of 80.04% or 88.16%. It is known that a fast lifetime generally represents non-radiative recombination due to the diffusion of photogenerated electron–hole pairs into defect sites or the extraction of charge carriers to the transport layer, while a slow lifetime represents the radiative electron–hole pair recombination of the perovskite by itself.7,24,25 Therefore, the great decrease of A1 value implies that DBP efficiently suppresses defect-induced non-radiative recombination by reducing the defect states of the perovskite film; while the obvious increases of τ2 and its weight fractions A2 could be associated with the re-emission of the perovskite by the re-excited perovskite due to Förster energy transfer between DBP and the perovskite (see Fig. 4f), besides the defect passivation effect of DBP. All these are well coincident with the enhancement of the steady-state PL intensity. Therefore, two reasons are though responsible for the increased PL intensity: (1) re-emission of the perovskite; (2) reduction of the defect states at the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite film. That is, DBP not only causes defect passivation but also modifies the absorption and emission spectra of the perovskite, all of which are beneficial to improving the EQE and Jsc of PSCs.
Next, the positive effects of DBP were further confirmed by the saturation photocurrent of solar cells. Fig. 4e shows the photocurrent densities (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) for the control and DBP PSCs. Jph was determined by Jph = Jlight − Jdark, where Jlight and Jdark are the current densities measured under illumination and in the dark, respectively; and Veff is determined by Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Va is the applied bias voltage. One can see that Jph increases linearly in the low Veff range and then saturates at the high value of Veff. The DBP devices had a higher saturation photocurrent (Jsat) (20.57 mA cm−2 for the THF–DBP device and 20.68 mA cm−2 for the CB–DBP device) than that of the control device (19.19 mA cm−2). In general, Jsat is associated with a maximum generation rate (Gmax) of electron–hole pairs,13,26,27 which is given as Jph = qGmaxL, where q is the electronic charge and L is the thickness of perovskite film (650 nm). The values of Gmax calculated by Jph were 2.01 × 1027 m−3 s−1 and 2.02 × 1027 m−3 s−1 for the devices with THF–DBP and CB–DBP modifications, respectively, which were higher than that of the control device (1.87 × 1027 m−3 s−1), which well correspond with the UV-vis absorption and PL measurements. For the DBP-modified perovskite, the stronger light absorption and lower defect states led it to exhibit a larger generation rate of free electrons and holes.
To elucidate more directly the defect passivation effect of the DBP layer, electron-only devices with a structure of ITO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/DBP(with or without)/PC61BM/Ag were fabricated and the corresponding J–V curves under dark conditions were measured, as shown in Fig. 5a. The trap density Ntrap in the perovskite film could be determined using eqn (1):12 (1)where VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, e is the electron charge, L is the thickness of perovskite film about 640 nm, ε is the relative dielectric constant of CH3NH3PbI3 (about 28.8),28 and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. The perovskite/DBP devices had a trap state density of 9.05 × 1015 cm−3 (THF–DBP) and 8.67 × 1015 cm−3 (CB–DBP), which were lower than that of the pure perovskite device (1.02 × 1016 cm−3). These results more directly indicated that the trap states in the perovskite film or the perovskite/ETL interface were effectively passivated by the DBP layer. The reduction of the defect states decreases the probability of charge recombination and thus facilitates the charge transfer from the perovskite to the ETL.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a nondestructive powerful technique to elucidate the charge transport and recombination process in solar cells. Fig. 5b shows the Nyquist plots of the three kinds of PSCs measured at a bias of 0.8 V under dark conditions, which were well-fitted using the equivalent circuit shown in the inset. It is known that the semicircle in the higher frequency region corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), while the one at the low-frequency region corresponds to the recombination resistance (Rrec) of the perovskite/ETL interface.29 The fitting parameters of the EIS data are presented in Table S3 (ESI†). The impedance analysis of the DBP-based PSCs yielded a lower Rs, Rct and a higher Rrec value compared with those of the control device. The lower Rs and Rct were related to the easier electron transfer from the perovskite to the ETL layer, while the higher Rrec indicated a lower recombination of electrons and holes. These results further support the roles of DBP as an interfacial passivation layer in reducing charge-carrier recombination and promoting charge-carrier transfer, thus yielding a higher efficiency.
Next, we investigated the influence of DBP on the interfacial energy level alignment. The perovskite films with and without DBP were tested by an atomic force microscopy (AFM) instrument equipped with scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM). Noncontact SKPM, as one of the methods for evaluating surface work functions, is employed to measure the potential difference between a sample and the SKPM tip.30Fig. 6 shows the AFM and SKPM morphologies of the three kinds of perovskite films. It was found that the roughness of all the films was similar, but the surface potential of the perovskite with DBP was clearly increased (more detailed information on this is summarized in Table S4, ESI†). The surface work functions of the perovskite film could be deduced from formula (2), (2)where q is the electronic charge, Wsample is the work function of the tested sample, WHOPG is the work function of the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) (with a fixed value of 4.65 eV), and Vsample and VHOPG are the average surface potentials of the sample and HOPG obtained from the SKPM images. Here, HOPG was used as a calibration for the measurement accuracy. It was found from formula (2) that the work function of the perovskite films was reduced from 4.52 to 4.42 and 4.35 eV with the addition of DBP, and correspondingly, the quasi Fermi level increased by 0.1–0.17 eV. We noted that the average Voc for the DBP devices showed a slight enhancement of 0.007–0.013 V compared with the control device, which could originate from the increased built-in electric field due to the enhanced quasi Fermi level of the perovskite interface by the DBP. Our investigations indicated that only a small amount of DBP is favorable for improving the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. With the amount of DBP increasing, the poor electron mobility of DBP and the energy level mismatch between DBP and the perovskite inevitably weaken the performance of PSCs.

The grain boundaries in perovskite film are sensitive to thermal stress and act as high-speed channels for the rapid diffusion of atomic, ionic, and molecular species.8 Therefore, an appropriate choice of interfacial layers to passivate the grain boundaries of perovskites is of vital importance to block iodide migration in the perovskite film and to resist the erosion from water and oxygen, and thereby to extend the lifetime of devices.15,16,31 In order to check the DBP effect on the illumination stability of PSCs, the evolution of the photovoltaic performance of PSCs with and without DBP stored in the glovebox were investigated over 30 days at room temperature with alternant 10 h dark and 14 h illumination (under fluorescent lamps of about 1000 lux). All the measurements were carried out in an air environment (about 30% RH). The efficiency of PSCs with DBP could retain more than 90% of their initial values, exhibiting more stable performance than the control device (which degraded to 80% of its initial PCE value at the same environment). The enhanced illumination stability by DBP in an excluded water and oxygen environment should originate from the passivation effect of DBP on the perovskite defects. Further, the thermal stability of the perovskite films in an air environment were checked. The picture tracking of different perovskite films annealed at temperatures of 190 °C over 25 min are shown in Fig. 7b. It can be seen from the pictures that the bare perovskite started to appear yellow in a phase transition at the 10th minute, while the perovskite with DBP kept the black phase until the 20th minute. The enhanced morphological thermal stability of the perovskite film could originate from the blocking of iodide migration in the perovskite film by the DBP. As reflected in Fig. 7b, the water contact angle on the perovskite with DBP was significantly increased from 42.3° to 98.5° and 76.6°. Therefore, except for the passivation effect of DBP, its hydrophobicity also enhanced the ability of PSCs to cope with water and oxygen environments. In short, DBP as an interface layer plays a positive role in improving the stability of PSCs.

Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated that the insertion of an organic luminescence small molecule material, namely DBP, between the perovskite layer and the electron-transport layer can significantly improve the PCE of PSCs. On the one hand, the addition of DBP increase the light absorption efficiency of the CH3NH3PbI3 active layer in the near-infrared region by FÖster energy transfer from DBP to the perovskite and makes up for the absorption shortage of the perovskite in the near-infrared region. On the other hand, the addition of DBP effectively passivates the defect states of the active layer and improves the interface energy level alignment, thereby reducing the carrier recombination loss at the interface. As a result, 8.5% and 9.5% gains in average PCE were achieved by the addition of DBP in the different solvents of THF and CB, respectively. At the same time, the introduction of DBP blocked the erosion of the perovskite by water and oxygen and ion/molecule diffusion. Due to the hydrophobicity of DBP and its passivation effect, the air, illumination, and thermal stabilities of DPB-based PSCs were clearly improved. These results indicate that the multifunctional luminescent organic molecules as interface engineering materials are a potentially useful method for further improving the performance of planar perovskite solar cells.
Experimental section
Materials
CH3NH3I was synthesized by a method reported in the literature.18 PbI2 (99.99%), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), [6,6]-phenylC61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), and bathophenanthroline (Bphen) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), tetrahydrofuran (THF), chlorobenzene (CB), ethanol, and isopropanol were purchased from Sigma. Tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) was bought from Taiwan Nichem Co., Ltd.
Device fabrication
The DBP precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 10 mg DBP in 2 ml THF or CB. After filtration, it was diluted to 1, 2, 3, and 4 mg ml−1, respectively. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.3482 g of MAI and 0.922 g PbI2 (MAI:PbI2 = 1.095:1) into 0.9 ml of DMF and 0.1 ml of DMSO mixed solvent. PCBM precursor solution was formulated to 20 mg ml−1 in CB and the formula for the Bphen precursor solution was 0.7 mg ml−1 in ethyl alcohol.
First, the patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent conductive glass was ultrasonically and subsequently cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 15 min, respectively. Then, the ITO glass was dried with nitrogen and placed in a plasma cleaner for 5 min before use. After that, 15 μl of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on the cleaned ITO at 6000 rpm for 30 s. Then, the films were annealed at 120 °C on a hotplate for 15 min in the air. Subsequently, the sample was sent to the glovebox and the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrate at 6000 rpm for 30 s. During the spin-coating process, sec-butanol (250 μl) as an anti-solvent was dropped on the wet CH3NH3PbI3 precursor film at the 8–10th s after spin-coating started. Then, the resulting film was annealed at 100 °C for 30 s. The above spin-coating process was carried out in a glovebox under a nitrogen atmosphere with a real-time humidity of about 1 ppm. Finally, the perovskite film was transferred to a hot plate, first annealed in ambient air (at 100 °C for 30 min, real-time humidity of 30–50%), and then annealed in a DMSO atmosphere at the same temperature and time. For the DMSO atmosphere, 50 μl of DMSO was dropped into a glass Petri dish, and then the sample was covered with a glass Petri dish. Subsequently, 25 μl DBP precursor solution was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s and 25 μl PC61BM precursor solution (20 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Then, the Bphen interfacial layer with a concentration of 0.7 mg ml−1 in ethanol was spin-coated at 6000 rpm for 30 s without additional annealing. The device was completed by evaporating a 100 nm thick Ag film as an electrode. The active device area was set to 0.04 cm2 by the overlap region between the top Ag cathode and the bottom ITO anode.
Device characterization
SEM images and XRD patterns of the films were obtained with a JSM-7100F from JEOL and a D/Max-B diffractometer from Rigaku, respectively. AFM and SKPM images were obtained using an atomic force microscope from a Park systems NX10 equipped with scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM). A solar simulator (ABET SUN3000) was used to provide simulated solar irradiation (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The J–V characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The output of the light source was adjusted using a calibrated silicon photodiode (ABET technology). The J–V measured the curve by a forward scan from −0.5 to 1.5 V and a reverse scan from 1.5 to −0.5 V. EQE (Keithley 2400) was measured using a power source (ZOLIX CSC1011) with a monochromator and a source meter. The steady-state and the transient-state PL spectra were measured by a xenon lamp at 467 nm and a nanosecond-pulsed laser at 376.2 nm using a fluorescence spectrometer (FLS980, Edinburgh Instruments). The absorption spectra were recorded by a Shimadzu UV-2600. Contact angles were measured by XG-CAMA1.
