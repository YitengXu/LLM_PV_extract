    , Accepted 14th June 2018First published on 16th June 2018AbstractA low-cost non-conjugated polymer, PEIE–DIO with a 3D conductive network, was developed by a simple quaterisation reaction between polyethyleneimine ethoxylate (PEIE) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). The inverted PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs with PEIE–DIO as an ETL achieve a PCE of 10.06%, and can keep a high PCE of 8.88% with 50 nm thick PEIE–DIO films, which are compatible with roll-to-roll techniques, making the fabrication of large-area devices at low cost possible.
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have gained extensive attention from both academic and industrial organizations because of their unique advantages, including light weight, mechanical flexibility, and suitability for fabricating large-scale and cost-efficient devices by high-throughput roll-to-roll processing.1–7 In the past decade, novel active materials and device-optimization techniques have been explored and applied, which have significantly promoted power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of PSCs.8–11 Inverted PSCs offer the advantages of superior long-term stability and improved device performance, due to favourable vertical phase separation with a composition gradient in active layers for charge transport and collection, and excellent long-term stability based on a stable indium tin oxide (ITO) cathode and a high work function (WF) metal anode.12–16
In inverted PSCs, electron transport layers (ETLs) are one of the crucial materials that alleviate surface energy barriers, facilitate charge transport and electrode selectivity, and also fill up interfacial trap sites and modulate microphase segregation. Lots of materials have been used as efficient ETLs in inverted PSCs, including inorganic metal oxide semiconductors17–21 and organic electron transport materials.22–29 Compared with inorganic counterparts, organic ETLs have the advantages of simple processability, good compatibility with flexible PSCs and chemical diversity.30,31 Non-conjugated polymers, such as polyethyleneimine ethoxylate (PEIE)32–34 and polyethyleneimine (PEI),35 are a series of low-cost commercial polymer ETLs and have been successfully utilized in high-performance inverted PSCs because the strong dipoles of the amine groups can shift the vacuum level and reduce the electron injection energy barrier. They can be easily processed in air at low temperature (<100 °C) from dilute solutions in environmentally friendly solvents. Unfortunately, the conductivities of these polymers are very low making the device performance very sensitive to the ETL thickness and they only work efficiently in a very thin thickness range (<10 nm), which create problems for the manufacture of PSCs on a large scale because fabricating ultrathin films with good uniformity using roll-to-roll techniques in large area is challenging.36 Consequently, two ETLs based on fullerene37 and naphthalene diimide derivatives38 have been developed for high-performance PSCs as thickness-insensitive ETLs. However, elaborate design and complex synthesis routes make these materials very expensive.
In this work, a low-cost polymer, PEIE–DIO with a 3D conductive network (Fig. 1a), was developed by a simple quaterisation reaction between PEIE and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). The inverted PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs with 3D conductive PEIE–DIO as an ETL achieve a PCE of 10.06%. Significantly, the inverted PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs can keep a high PCE of 8.88% when 50 nm thick PEIE–DIO is applied, exhibiting excellent thickness insensitivity. To investigate the effects of the 3D conductive network on electron transport properties, another linear polymer PEIE–IB was prepared by the quaterisation reaction between PEIE and n-iodobutane (IB).

The schematic diagrams of PEIE, PEIE–DIO and PEIE–IB are shown in Fig. 1a. The chemical compositions of PEIE, PEIE–DIO and PEIE–IB are characterized by high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 1b, the N(1s) peak of PEIE appears around 400 eV, which is mainly attributed to the nitrogen in secondary amine (400.9 eV) and the nitrogen in tertiary amine (398.9 eV). Compared with PEIE, both PEIE–DIO and PEIE–IB exhibit an additional peak at 402.0 eV that is assigned to the nitrogen ion (N+) in the quaternary ammonium salt.34,39 In Fig. 1c, PEIE does not show the I(3d) peak, whereas both PEIE–DIO and PEIE–IB show two I(3d) peaks at 618.4 eV and 629.9 eV that can be ascribed to the iodide ion (I−)40 and the covalent iodine (I), respectively. These results indicate that the quaternary ammonium salt is produced in PEIE–DIO and PEIE–IB because PEIE reacts with DIO or IB. Moreover, the FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) spectra also give a similar conclusion (Fig. S1a†). By calculating the integral area ratio between peaks at 402.0 eV and N(1s) peaks, the N+/N ratios of PEIE–DIO and PEIE–IB are close to 25%, which indicates that one quarter of the nitrogen atoms are changed to ammonium ions. According to the integral area ratio between peaks at 618.4 eV and I(3d) peaks, about two-thirds of the iodine atoms are converted to iodide ions in PEIE–DIO and PEIE–IB. In other words, PEIE–DIO could be a partially cross-linked polymer. We tried to use gel permeation chromatography (THF or DMF as the eluants) to characterize the molecular weights of the polymers, but no available curves have been obtained. As shown in Fig. S1b,† the particle size of PEIE–DIO is obviously larger than that of PEIE–IB, which indicates that a partially cross-linked network has been formed in PEIE–DIO since both of them are prepared with similar mols of iodoalkyl groups. Therefore, it can still be dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol and processed by spin-coating.
The conductivities of PEIE–DIO, PEIE–IB, and PEIE films are characterized using a device configuration of ITO/ETLs (100 nm)/Ag. The conductivities of PEIE–DIO, PEIE–IB, and PEIE are calculated to be 2.6 × 10−5, 1.1 × 10−5, and 3.7 × 10−6 S cm−1 (Fig. 1d), respectively. PEIE–DIO exhibits much higher conductivity than PEIE and PEIE–IB, which implies that the formation of quaternary ammonium iodide and the cross-linked structure of PEIE–DIO improve its conductivity.
The WFs of ITO and ITO with different ETLs were characterized by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). As shown in Fig. 1e, the WF of pristine ITO is 4.72 eV, and it is reduced to 4.08 eV, 4.09 eV and 4.36 eV when it is covered by PEIE–DIO, PEIE–IB and PEIE, respectively. The low WF of PEIE/ITO originates from the intrinsic molecular dipole associated with the neutral ethylamine group and the surface interfacial dipole formed at the polymer/electrode interface.32 Compared with PEIE/ITO, PEIE–DIO/ITO and PEIE–IB/ITO possess lower WFs because additional quaternary ammonium ions produce a stronger molecular dipole that facilitates electron extraction in PSCs.28,41,42
The inverted PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs with a configuration of ITO/ETL/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag with different ETLs (PEIE–DIO, PEIE–IB, and PEIE) were fabricated. At the beginning, the preliminary device optimization was carried out by optimizing the weight ratio of PEIE:DIO with a thickness of about 10 nm (Fig. S2, Table S1†). Obviously, the PSC device with a weight ratio of 1:4 possesses the best device performance, which could be derived from an appropriate molecular weight and the extent of reaction. Therefore, all the other PSC devices are prepared with the optimized weight ratio of 1:4 unless otherwise noted. Fig. 2a shows the J–V characteristics of optimized PSCs with different ETLs. Device photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. All PSCs exhibit a similar open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.78 V, and obviously different short-circuit current density (JSC) values. The JSC of PSCs is 15.95 ± 0.16 mA cm−2 for PEIE (8 nm), 16.83 ± 0.17 mA cm−2 for PEIE–IB (9 nm), and 17.54 ± 0.14 mA cm−2 for PEIE–DIO (9 nm). The integrated JSC values, obtained from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 2b), are 15.97, 16.76, and 17.62 mA cm−2 for the devices with PEIE, PEIE–IB, and PEIE–DIO as the ETLs, respectively, which are close to the measured JSC values with the errors about 3%. Compared with the PEIE (8 nm)-based PSCs, the PEIE–IB (9 nm)-based PSCs show higher PCE values of 9.06 ± 0.35% with a fill factor (FF) of 0.69 ± 0.01. The PEIE–DIO (9 nm)-based PSCs show the best PCE of 10.06% with a FF of 0.71 ± 0.01.

With the increase in the thickness of PEIE, all photovoltaic parameters of PSCs rapidly decrease (Fig. S3a†), and the PCE values reduce to 0.71 ± 0.26% with JSC of 5.36 ± 0.47 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.70 ± 0.02 and FF of 0.19 ± 0.04 when the thickness is 47 nm (Fig. 3a and Table 1). It is reasonable that thick PEIE leads to a large series resistance (Rs) and inferior electron transport. Surprisingly, the photovoltaic parameters of the PEIE–DIO-based PSCs only show a slight decrease (Fig. S3b†). The PCE values only reduce to 9.02 ± 0.17% when the thickness of PEIE–DIO is increased to 34 nm (Table S2†), which are higher than those (9.01 ± 0.09%) of the PSC based on the conjugated polymer 20%PN4N@x-N2200 (20 nm) as the ETL.38 The PCE values only reduce to 8.56 ± 0.32% though the thickness of PEIE–DIO is increased to 50 nm. The PSCs based on PEIE–IB (48 nm) exhibit medium PCE values of 5.47 ± 0.37%. The PCE of PEIE–DIO (50 nm)-based PSCs is 10 times higher than that of PEIE (47 nm)-based PSCs. The integrated JSC values obtained from the EQE spectra (Fig. 3b) are 16.37, 13.66, and 5.60 mA cm−2 for the devices with PEIE–DIO (50 nm), PEIE–IB (48 nm), and PEIE (47 nm) as the ETLs, respectively, which are close to the measured JSC values.

In comparison with the PEIE-based PSCs, the major improvement in PEIE–DIO (9 nm)-based PSCs is attributed to the increase of JSC. Generally, JSC is determined by several basic physical processes in devices that include light absorption, charge separation, charge transport, and charge extraction.
The transmission spectra of PEIE–DIO, PEIE–IB and PEIE films are shown in Fig. 4a. PEIE–DIO, PEIE–IB and PEIE films on ITO possess similar light transmittance, indicating that similar light is absorbed in the PSCs. Then, the electron mobilities of the ETLs are characterized by studying space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in electron-only devices with a configuration of ITO/Al/ETL/Al.43 The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 4b. The devices with PEIE–DIO (9 nm), PEIE–IB (8 nm), and PEIE (8 nm) exhibit electron mobilities of 5.90 × 10−5, 3.75 × 10−5 and 1.77 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Compared with PEIE, PEIE–IB and PEIE–DIO show higher electron mobilities, which indicates that the structure of quaternary ammonium iodide is favorable for improving electron mobility. Compared with PEIE–IB, PEIE–DIO exhibits higher electron mobility which implies that the 3D conductive network of PEIE–DIO is beneficial to improving electron mobility.

The time-resolved PL spectra of the PSCs with PEIE–DIO, PEIE–IB and PEIE films as ETLs are shown in Fig. 4c. It is calculated that the exciton lifetimes (τexciton) of the photoactive layers on PEIE–DIO, PEIE–IB, and PEIE are 2.71, 3.45, and 4.20 ns, respectively. The photoactive layer on PEIE–DIO shows the fastest exciton decay rate, which indicates that the PEIE–DIO film leads to the most effective charge separation and electron extraction capability.
To further understand the function of PEIE–DIO films in PSCs, the surface properties of PEIE–DIO, PEIE–IB and PEIE films on ITO substrates are investigated (Fig. S4†). All the ETLs improve the hydrophobicity of ITO substrates and the contact angle on the PEIE–DIO films is the highest that will lead to a better contact between active layers and ETLs. Moreover, the active layer on PEIE–DIO film shows the smallest domain size and the smallest surface root mean square roughness value of 1.29 nm (Fig. S5 and S6†). These results are consistent with electrical impedance spectrum results (Fig. S7†). The extracted contact resistance of devices with the PEIE–DIO film is notably reduced which will facilitate electron extraction from active layers to the ITO electrode.
Finally, the effect of PEIE–DIO films on the device stability is investigated. The PEIE–DIO-based inverted PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs show better stability than PEIE-based devices under ambient conditions (30% relative humidity), (Fig. S8†) which is proposed to be due to the higher hydrophobicity of PEIE–DIO.44
In conclusion, a low-cost polymer PEIE–DIO with a 3D conductive network is developed by a simple quaterisation reaction between PEIE and DIO, which is employed as an efficient ETL for high-performance inverted PSCs. The PEIE–DIO with the 3D conductive network exhibits high optical transparency, low work function, high conductivity, high electron transport/extraction properties, and orthogonal solvent processability that are crucial for high performance PSCs. As a result, PEIE–DIO based inverted PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs show a high PCE exceeding 10%. More importantly, inverted PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs show a high PCE of ∼9% with 50 nm thick PEIE–DIO films, which are compatible with roll-to-roll techniques, making the fabrication of large-area devices at low cost possible.
