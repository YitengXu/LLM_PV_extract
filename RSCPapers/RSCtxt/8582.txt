    , Accepted 5th March 2019First published on 6th March 2019AbstractAsymmetric acceptor–donor–acceptor (ADA)-type fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) have recently attracted increasing interest due to their excellent photovoltaic properties. However, terminal group engineering hasn't received as much attention as central core engineering does. In this work, we designed and synthesized a novel asymmetric FREA with two distinct terminal groups, namely IDTT-2F-Th, to further extend the asymmetricity along the backbone. Indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) is end-capped with 2-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophen-4-ylidene)malononitrile and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile terminal groups. Compared with the symmetrical ITCPTC acceptor, IDTT-2F-Th exhibits a deeper lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO) energy level, broader absorption range and relatively lower crystalline nature. By blending with the PBT1-C-2Cl donor, IDTT-2F-Th-based organic solar cells (OSCs) show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.0%, which is higher than that (10.3%) of ITCPTC-based devices. Our results demonstrate that terminal group engineering is a promising approach for developing high-performance asymmetric FREAs.
1 Introduction
The last few years have witnessed rapid progress of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) was reported to be 11% in 2014.1 Nowadays, state-of-the-art OSCs have reached PCE over 17%.2 Such impressive achievements are mainly attributed to the development of materials, and device and morphological engineering.3–12 Fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs), particularly ITIC analogues,13 are considered as a key factor of electron acceptor development, which plays a vital role as a significant component for harvesting light and transporting electrons in the active layers of OSCs.8,9,14–17 Due to the high modifiability of the structure of FREAs relative to fullerene derivatives, the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels, absorption regions, solubility and crystallinity of FREAs could be customized, which would be highly beneficial to match the donor materials for small energy loss with high open-circuit voltage (Voc) and complementary absorption spectra with high short-circuit current (Jsc). Therefore, a large number of FREAs have been designed, synthesized and applied in OSCs and a lot of effort has been devoted to understanding the photophysics of FREAs.18–38
Asymmetrical FREAs with excellent photovoltaic performance have been recently reported.39–49 For example, very recently, we first reported a novel asymmetric TPTT-IC using a TPTT core unit.39 Compared with the symmetric ITIC acceptor, high electron mobility was achieved for TPTT-IC due to its stronger intermolecular interactions. As a result, a high PCE of 10.5% has been obtained for TPTT-IC-based devices. From the aspect of molecular design, FREAs with asymmetrical conjugated central cores have been the most reported because of their facile synthesis and purification. Nevertheless, asymmetrical FREAs containing different terminal groups are rare, because the last Knoevenagel condensation reaction is a thermodynamically controlled reversible reaction.20 It is well known that the terminal groups play an important role in determining the long range ordering of FREAs, evidenced by X-ray single crystal structural analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.33,50–52 Therefore, more studies should be focused on FREAs with distinct terminal groups to further understand the structure–performance relationship, especially for their influence on the molecular packing and ordering.
In this contribution, we designed and synthesized a novel asymmetric FREA, IDTT-2F-Th, which comprises two different terminal groups, 2-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophen-4-ylidene)malononitrile (TIC) and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2FIC) (Fig. 1). Here, we chose two terminal groups with a large polarity difference and adopted a one-pot method to successfully synthesize IDTT-2F-Th. By adding a dialdehyde compound with two equimolar terminal groups, it was feasible to obtain the target product isolated from the composite by silica gel chromatography. Subsequently, the physical and chemical properties of IDTT-2F-Th were characterized. It was found that after replacing the TIC terminal group with 2FIC terminal groups, IDTT-2F-Th showed great changes in optical absorption, bandgap and energy levels relative to its symmetrical analogue ITCPTC, owing to the differences in both terminal groups with respect to molecular geometries and electron-withdrawing abilities. Especially for molecular stacking, the ordering of IDTT-2F-Th is slightly decreased, as evident by the weaker intensity of the peak from grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). When FREAs were blended with the polymer PBT1-C-2Cl,53 more balanced carrier mobilities were achieved for the IDTT-2F-Th:PBT1-C-2Cl blend. Eventually, a PCE of 12.01% could be obtained for PBT1-C-2Cl:IDTT-2F-Th devices, which is higher than that (10.31%) of PBT1-C-2Cl:ITCPTC devices. These results indicate that IDTT-2F-Th is a promising electron acceptor for the fabrication of high-efficiency OSCs.

2 Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis
The synthetic route of the asymmetrical FREA IDTT-2F-Th is shown in Scheme S1.† The dialdehyde compound with four hexylphenyl substituted indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) was used to perform a Knoevenagel condensation reaction with two different terminal groups, TIC and 2FIC. The crude products could be easily purified by silica gel chromatography to provide the asymmetrical compound IDTT-2F-Th, which exhibits good solubility in common solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform and chlorobenzene.
2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
To understand how the asymmetrical structure influences the optical and electrochemical properties, UV-Vis absorption and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out and the detailed data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2a, both FREAs exhibit the same absorption regions (300–750 nm) and their maximum absorption peaks (690 nm) are nearly same in solution, but the extinction coefficient (1.94 × 105 M−1 cm−1) of the symmetrical ITCPTC is slightly higher than that of the asymmetrical IDTT-2F-Th (1.91 × 105 M−1 cm−1). Due to the enhanced intermolecular interaction, a strong bathochromic shift could be clearly observed in both IDTT-2F-Th and ITCPTC films (Fig. 2b). Besides, the maximum absorption peak (731 nm) of IDTT-2F-Th undergoes a red-shift of 6 nm relative to that of ITCPTC (725 nm). The optical bandgaps of IDTT-2F-Th and ITCPTC were calculated to be 1.55 and 1.58 eV, respectively, according to the equation Eoptg = 1240/λonset. The absorption spectrum of the polymer donor PBT1-C-2Cl is complementary to those of both FREAs (Fig. 2c), which could better match with the solar spectrum, thus favoring higher Jsc values.

According to the CV results (Fig. 2d), the HOMO/LUMO levels of ITCPTC and IDTT-2F-Th were calculated to be −5.76/−4.02 and −5.78/−4.09 eV, respectively. Compared to ITCPTC, the down-shifted LUMO level of IDTT-2F-Th is attributed to the fact that the 2FIC has a stronger electron-withdrawing ability than TIC. As the HOMO/LUMO levels of the polymer donor PBT1-C-2Cl are located at −5.59/−3.53 eV, there is enough driving force for exciton separation between the donor and the acceptors. In addition, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was also carried out to measure the HOMO levels. From Fig. S4,† it can be seen that the HOMO levels of PBT1-C-2Cl, ITCPTC and IDTT-2F-Th were calculated to be −5.51, −5.88 and −5.92 eV, respectively, which are in good agreement with the CV results.
2.3. Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of IDTT-2F-Th and ITCPTC, OSC devices with an inverted device architecture of ITO/ZnO/PBT1-C-2Cl:FREAs/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. PBT1-C-2Cl and FREA were dissolved in chlorobenzene with a weight ratio of 1:1 and 0.25 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane additive. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves under the optimal conditions are shown in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 2. In addition, the detailed device parameters of optimized PBT1-C-2Cl:IDTT-2F-Th and PBT1-C-2Cl:ITCPTC solar cells are also summarized in Tables S1 and S2,† respectively. PBT1-C-2Cl:IDTT-2F-Th devices showed a higher PCE of 12.01%, with lower Voc of 0.912 V, higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.82 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 73.9% compared to those of the PBT1-C-2Cl:ITCPTC devices (PCE = 10.31%, Voc = 0.968 V, Jsc = 15.92 mA cm−2 and FF = 66.9%). These results agree well with the lower LUMO level but the broader absorption of IDTT-2F-Th than that of ITCPTC.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PBT1-C-2Cl:IDTT-2F-Th and PBT1-C-2Cl:ITCPTC devices are presented in Fig. 3b. The devices based on IDTT-2F-Th show a wider photoresponse than the devices based on ITCPTC, consistent with the absorption of blends. Moreover, it is obvious that EQE values are higher for the devices based on IDTT-2F-Th in the wavelength range of 600 to 820 nm, indicating that the incident sunlight could be better transformed into current, which could be attributed to IDTT-2F-Th. Therefore, PBT1-C-2Cl:IDTT-2F-Th devices exhibited a superior integrated Jsc of 17.00 mA cm−2 relative to the PBT1-C-2Cl:ITCPTC devices with an integrated Jsc of 15.30 mA cm−2 (the error is <5%).
2.4. Charge transfer and recombination
Exciton dissociation and charge collection as the key parameters of OSCs were evaluated by plotting the photocurrent density (Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively) versus the effective voltage (Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is 0 and Vbias is the applied external voltage bias) curves (Fig. 3c). At high Veff (>2.5 V under this condition), Jph becomes saturated (Jsat), suggesting that all the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charges and collected by individual electrodes with a negligible charge recombination. Herein, Jph/Jsat is defined as a charge collection probability (Pc). The PBT1-C-2Cl:IDTT-2F-Th devices demonstrated a slightly high Pc value of 95.4%, compared with the PBT1-C-2Cl:ITCPTC devices (94.3%), which is indicative of a higher exciton dissociation rate and more efficient charge collection in the devices based on PBT1-C-2Cl:IDTT-2F-Th.
To understand the charge recombination in the OSCs, the relationship between light intensity (Plight) and Jsc was studied. The correlation between Jsc and Plight can be analyzed based on Jsc ∝ Pα. When α is equal to 1, all free carriers are swept out and collected at the electrodes prior to recombination. If α < 1, there is some extent of bimolecular recombination. As shown in Fig. 3d, the values of PBT1-C-2Cl:IDTT-2F-Th and PBT1-C-2Cl:ITCPTC are 0.997 and 0.990, respectively, implying slightly reduced bimolecular recombination in the devices based on PBT1-C-2Cl:IDTT-2F-Th.
2.5. Film morphology and charge transport properties
To further investigate the relationship between the two FREAs and their morphologies, atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping mode and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed. As shown in Fig. 4, both blends exhibit homogeneous fibrillar network morphology, also evidenced by the TEM images (Fig. 4c and f). The fibrillar network structure has been reported to be beneficial for charge transport.7,54 In addition, the numerous fibers lead to a larger root-mean-square surface (RMS) roughness value of 2.19 nm for the PBT1-C-2Cl:IDTT-2F-Th blend compared to the RMS roughness value of 1.43 nm for the PBT1-C-2Cl:ITCPTC blend.

Moreover, we conducted grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements to reveal the molecular packing characteristics in both pure and blend films, as shown in Fig. 5.50 In the pure films, the two FREAs and PBT1-C-2Cl all exhibit a preferential face-on orientation, which is beneficial to vertical charge transport. The lamellar diffraction peaks of ITCPTC and IDTT-2F-Th appear at qr = 0.33 Å−1 (d-spacing = 19.0 Å) and 0.34 Å−1 (d-spacing = 18.5 Å), respectively, while the π–π peaks locate at qz = 1.77 Å−1 (d-spacing = 3.19 Å) for both FREAs. The lamellar peak for the donor PBT1-C-2Cl is at qr = 0.26 Å−1 (d-spacing = 24.2 Å) and the π–π peak is at qz = 1.66 Å−1 (d-spacing = 3.79 Å). According to the Scherrer equation, the crystal coherence length (CCL) of the π–π peak for IDzTT-2F-Th is 17.6 Å, smaller than that of ITCPTC film (24.4 Å), suggesting that the asymmetrical terminal groups reduce the crystallinity of the pure IDTT-2F-Th film. For both blend films withthe PBT1-C-2Cl donor, the lamellar peaks appear at qr = 0.27 Å−1 (d-spacing = 23.3 Å) while the π–π peaks appear at qz = 1.70 Å−1 (d-spacing = 3.70 Å). Compared with the lattice constants observed for pure films, we assign the lamellar peaks predominantly to the donor packing and the π–π peaks to the synergistic contribution of both donor and acceptor. Interestingly, the CCLs of the PBT1-C-2Cl:ITCPTC film (lamellar 146 Å, π–π 15.6 Å) are slightly larger than those of the PBT1-C-2Cl:IDTT-2F-Th film (lamellar 86.6 Å, π–π 14.5 Å). It suggests that the asymmetric acceptor, though with relatively lower crystallinity, could promote the molecular packing of the donor in the blend films, being beneficial to the device performance.

The space-charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to obtain information on the charge transport properties of pristine and blend films and the data are summarized in Fig. S5 and Table S3.† In pristine films, the electron mobility of 3.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IDTT-2F-Th is slightly lower than that of ITCPTC (3.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Among the blends, the PBT1-C-2Cl:IDTT-2F-Th blend shows hole and electron mobilities of 9.0 × 10−4 and 8.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are relatively lower than those of the PBT1-C-2Cl:ITCPTC blend (1.07 × 10−3 and 9.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), which could correlate well with the GIWAXS data. Moreover, the more balanced hole and electron mobilities, obtained for the PBT1-C-2Cl:IDTT-2F-Th blend (10.3 versus 11.5), are advantageous to realize a higher FF.
3 Conclusions
In summary, a novel asymmetric FREA, IDTT-2F-Th, with two distinct terminal groups, has been designed, synthesized and characterized. The asymmetric terminals were found to have a remarkable influence on the optical absorption, bandgap and energy levels, and molecular stacking. When blended with PBT1-C-2Cl, IDTT-2F-Th-based solar cells yielded a superior PCE of 12.01%, which is higher than that (10.31%) of ITCPTC-based OSCs. The broader optical absorption, and the more balanced hole and electron mobilities account for the high photovoltaic performance in IDTT-2F-Th-based devices. These results indicate that terminal group engineering serves as a feasible approach for the design of high-performance asymmetric FREAs.
