    , Accepted 17th April 2017First published on 18th April 2017AbstractSince Fe2O3 is a promising photoanode material for water splitting, it has attracted much attention, while other phases of ferric oxide are ignored. Here, β-Fe2O3 was used as a photoanode material for solar water splitting. The crystal structure and phase of β-Fe2O3 were characterized by using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman scattering, Mössbauer spectra and a superconducting quantum interference device. The photocurrent density of the β-Fe2O3 photoanode at 1.6 VRHE was 0.12 mA·cm−2 under the illumination of simulated sunlight (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2).
Introduction
Solar hydrogen production via photoelectrochemical water splitting is considered to be an important method to solve the global energy crisis. Hematite (α-Fe2O3), as a promising semiconductor photocatalysis material, has received much attention in the past 40 years. Due to its excellent photo-chemical stability, efficacious light absorption ability and abundance in nature, hematite has been envisioned as a strong candidate for photoanode materials. However its photoelectrochemical performances are obstructed by the low conductivity, short hole transport distance and large over potential.1 The onset potential of a photoanode is mainly determined by the potential difference between the bottom of the conduction band and the reduction potential of hydrogen in H2O. In order to make the water splitting reaction proceed on the photoelectrode, additional bias must be applied. Large over potential implies higher bias, which means that more extra energy apart from solar energy is needed to decompose water.2,3 Since the conduction band of α-Fe2O3 is 0.4 V higher than water reduction potential, external bias must be applied to overcome the over potential. Lots of efforts have been made to reduce the over potential of hematite, such as co-catalyst surface modification (IrO, Co-Pi, cobalt oxide/fluoride),4–8 surface passivation9 and surface corrosion.10
The theoretical saturation photocurrent density of hematite is 12.6 mA cm−2, which is determined by its band gap of 2.1 eV.4 In the past few decades, much effort has been made to increase the solar photocurrent of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. Though recent researchers have reported a solar photocurrent density value close to 4 mA cm−2,4 it is far from the theoretical value. An obvious fact is ignored in the study: β-Fe2O3 is a more promising phase for solar water splitting. Beta-Fe2O3, the metastable form of iron(III) oxide, is a cubic body centered crystal structure which belongs to the space group Ia3. German scientists have discovered the phase in 1958 and confirmed its structure.11 In retrospect, only a few researchers have paid attention to β-Fe2O3. Some reports have investigated magnetism properties or gas sensitivity of β-Fe2O3 while ignoring its photoelectrochemical performance.12,13 Compared with α-Fe2O3, β-Fe2O3 has a smaller band gap of 1.9 eV.14 That is to say, from the perspective of light absorption, β-Fe2O3 could absorb and utilize sunlight more effectively. In photoelectrochemical cells, the theoretical saturation photocurrent density is determined by the band gap of semiconductors. According to the formula:  the theoretical saturation photocurrent density of β-Fe2O3 is 17.0 mA cm−2 with a solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency of 20.9%.2 The calculation result of two different phase iron oxides is given in Fig. S1.† Note that, as a direct band gap semiconductor material, the electrons in β-Fe2O3 are more likely to be excited, especially when the wavelength of the excitation light is near the band edge. This may imply that β-Fe2O3 has better photoelectrochemical performances than hematite.
As a metastable phase of ferric oxide, phase transformation of β-Fe2O3 may occur during the annealing treatment. However, when the photoanode is immersed in an electrolyte and works at room temperature, the phase transition will not happen. In earlier work, we have found that the photoanode prepared by an ultrasonic spray pyrolysis method has different phases, one of which is β-Fe2O3. The same experimental result was reported by Krol and Serna.15,16 In order to avoid the influence of impurity phases (often hematite), we synthesized pure β-Fe2O3 nanoparticles by using the method reported by Nakanishi.17,18 Afterward, β-Fe2O3 powder was assembled into photoanode films for photoelectrochemical water splitting, and its photochemical stability for water splitting was confirmed. The 0.12 mA cm−2 photocurrent density of the β-Fe2O3 photoanode was observed at 1.6 VRHE under standard simulated sunlight (AM1.5G). X-Ray diffraction, Raman scattering, an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer and a superconducting quantum interference device were used for phase characterization.
Experimental
Synthesis of β-Fe2O3 nanoparticles
The solution containing Fe2(SO4)3 and Na2SO4 was evaporated in an oven to obtain NaFe(SO4)2. Beta-Fe2O3 powder was synthesized by heating the fully ground mixture of NaFe(SO4)2 and NaCl in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 1 hour. The product was washed with distilled water several times and dried in the oven.
Preparation of photoanode films
The β-Fe2O3 photoanode film was prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass by electrophoretic deposition. In order to enhance the connection and conductivity between nano-particles, 0.2 μmol TiCl4 methanol solution was dropped on the films, and then hydrolyzed into TiO2. Subsequently, the nanoparticle-assembled photoanode films were calcined in a muffle furnace at different temperatures (450 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C, 600 °C, and 650 °C) for various times (1 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 32 h).
Characterization
The crystal structures of powder and photoanode films were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (Rigaku Ultima III, Japan, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54178 Å). Raman spectra were collected by using a confocal laser Raman spectrometer using silicon for calibration (Horiba, LabRAM Aramis, Japan). The magnetic characterization was carried out by using a superconducting quantum interference device (Quantum Design, MPMSXL-7, USA) and a Mössbauer spectrometer adjusted with α-56Fe (Cryodynamics I.O.A.I, VIS-1170-MO, USA, used 57Co as a radioactive source). The valence state of the elements was represented by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (U1VAC-PHI, PHI 5000 VersaProbe, Japan). The morphologies of the photoanode were observed by using a scanning electron microscope (ZEISS, ULTRA55, Germany).
The photoelectrochemical performance was measured by using an electrochemical analyser (Shanghai Chenhua, CHI-760E, China) and a standard simulated solar light source (Newport, Oriel Sol3A Class AAA Solar Simulators 94063A, USA), which is calibrated with an optical intensity meter (Newport, 840-C, USA). The differential thermal analysis was performed by using a simultaneous thermal analyser (Netzsch, STA 449 F3, Germany). The light absorption properties of the sample were determined by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2550, Japan).
Results and discussion
X-ray diffraction
For a metastable phase of iron oxide, the characterization of β-Fe2O3 must be carefully considered and examined to avoid the influence of miscellaneous phases. Fig. 1 shows the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of β-Fe2O3 nanoparticles. In addition to the β-Fe2O3 characteristic peaks, no characteristic peaks of other phase iron oxide appeared. During the fabrication process of β-Fe2O3 nanoparticle-assembled photoanode films, necking treatment and subsequent annealing may lead to the phase transformation of β-Fe2O3 to α-Fe2O3. Further XRD characterization was carried out during the preparation of the nanoparticle-assembled photoanode films.

The diffraction peak in Fig. 2 indicated that there was no phase transformation after 600 °C heat treatment. It proved that necking and post-treatment did not change the phase of β-Fe2O3. However, β–α phase transformation of iron oxide occurs when calcined at 650 °C. The heat treatment of 32 hours made all the β-Fe2O3 turn into hematite finally. The corresponding thermal analysis data are shown in Fig. S2.†

Raman scattering

Fig. 3 shows the visible resonance Raman scattering of the iron oxide photoanode film (excitation wavelength was 785 nm, and laser power was 0.1 mW). Except the eight vibration modes of β-Fe2O3, no other vibration mode could be observed. It means that the 600 °C heat treatment did not cause any phase change whether in the bulk or on the surface of the nanoparticle-assembled films.

Magnetic characterization

Fig. 4 describes the temperature dependence of magnetization properties, which is consistent with the result in the literature.18 The sample annealed at 600 °C exhibits two typical transition peaks at 116 K and 243 K. This may be regarded as evidence that the 600 °C calcination process was not a phase transition process. In Fig. 5, it can be seen that after being calcined at 650 °C for 32 h, all the β-Fe2O3 samples were converted to α-Fe2O3, while the samples annealed at 600 °C remained the original phase.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
As shown in Fig. 6, the calcination of 1 h at 600 °C does not alter the binding energy of the iron atom and the position of the valence band. Beta-Fe2O3 has a lower valence band than the sample annealed at 650 °C for 32 h, which has been transformed into hematite completely.

According to the results of calculation and experiment, the energy band schematic diagrams of two different phases are shown in Fig. S6.† The results show that β-Fe2O3 has a similar conduction band position with hematite. Furthermore, they may exhibit the same onset potential. In fact, we have observed that the β-Fe2O3 photoanode exhibits the 0.95 VRHE onset potential for water oxidation, which is very close to that of the hematite photoanode.
Scanning electron microscopy
The photographs of the β-Fe2O3 nanoparticle-assembled photoanode films before and after the annealing are shown in Fig. 7. The photoanode prepared by electrophoretic deposition shows a loose particle packing film. Because of the low synthesis temperature, the crystallinity of the samples is poor. As shown in Fig. 7(a and b), there are a few cubic particles in the case of the photoanode without heat treatment. After annealing at 600 °C for 1 h, the cube morphology becomes clear (Fig. 7c and d). The variation of the grain size also shows the crystal growth (Fig. S3†). This process shows that the iron oxide crystals grow up and the crystallinity is improved under the annealing of 600 °C. Further annealing leads to crystal rupture and the aggregation of nanoparticles (Fig. 7e and f). The XRD analysis shows that the phase transformation process has been completed.

Photoelectrochemical testing
Because of the poor translucency of the nanoparticle-assembled electrode and the poor conductivity of hematite, the photocurrent density with backside illumination was much higher than that of frontside illumination. The beta-Fe2O3 photoanode shows a solar photocurrent of ca. 0.12 mA cm2 at 1.6 VRHE (Fig. 8).

For granular films of the photoelectrode, necking is a common method to strengthen the connection of nanoparticles and build a charge transfer channel. This method requires annealing treatment of the film. However, this measure is not suitable for β-Fe2O3. High temperature annealing is an effective method to improve the photocurrent of the common photoanodes. The XRD pattern of the β-Fe2O3 photoanode film indicates that less impurity formation of α-Fe2O3 occurs (Fig. 2 & S8†) in the sample annealed at 650 °C for 1 h. The content of hematite increased with the sintering time.
Nevertheless, the UV-vis absorption spectrum did not change for the sample annealed at 650 °C for 1 h. Considering the little hematite content, it is reasonable that the photocurrent mainly comes from β-Fe2O3. The sample calcined at 650 °C for 1 h exhibited 0.44 mA cm2 photocurrent at 1.6 VRHE (Fig. S5†). Longer calcine operation results in the photocurrent degradation, which is due to the phase transformation and grain breakage, and the other is due to the decrease of the conductivity of FTO glass. Although its photoelectrochemical performance cannot match the existing research on hematite, it is quite understandable for the following reasons:
First and foremost, the poor connection and conductivity between nanoparticles hinder the carrier transfer. High temperature annealing is not possible due to phase transition and substrate limitations. Improving charge transfer is the key to improve its photoelectrochemical performance.
Moreover, a low carrier concentration of iron oxide is an important factor affecting the charge transfer in nanoparticles. For hematite, increasing the concentration with high valence element doping (Ti4+, Si4+ for example) is an important method to improve the photocurrent. However, in order to simplify the problem and ensure the purity of phase, no element doping was performed during the sample preparation.
Last but not least, the hole injection efficiency of the solid–liquid interface has not been studied. The work of improving the charge injection efficiency through cocatalyst modification and surface passivation will be reported in our subsequent work.
Considering the above factors, the photoelectrochemical performances of the β-Fe2O3 photoanode will be improved in future studies.
Conclusions
Beta-Fe2O3 was synthesized by a solid state reaction using NaFe(SO4)2 as a precursor. For the first time, we have prepared a β-Fe2O3 nanoparticle-assembled film photoanode by electrophoretic deposition and used it as a photoanode for solar water splitting. Titanium oxide is used as an electric coupling agent to improve the charge transfer between nanoparticles. We observed a solar photocurrent of 0.12 mA cm−2 at 1.6 VRHE in the pure β-Fe2O3 photoanode and 0.44 mA cm−2 at 1.6 VRHE in the sample with trace impurity. Various characterization techniques were used to prove that the sample is pure β-Fe2O3, and that the photocurrent comes from β-Fe2O3.
