, Accepted 29th June 2015First published on 29th June 2015AbstractFollowing the recent development of functional materials based on metal-containing conducting polymers, we designed and synthesized a series of bithiophene based N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) conducting polymers containing coinage metals (Cu, Ag, and Au). Absorption spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to analyze the monomers and the polymer thin films. The peak currents of the electrodeposited films on Pt-button electrodes increased proportionally with the scan rate, exhibiting the stability of the polymer thin films. Remarkably, in the electrochemical studies of the coinage metal complexes, the redox potential of Cu+/Cu2+ perfectly matched with the redox wave of quaterthiophene moieties of the polymer backbone. However, the redox potential of Ag/Ag+ did not match with the redox potential of the polymer backbone. During the oxidation process in the spectroelectrochemical studies, the conducting coinage metallopolymers exhibited a drastic color change from orange (reduced form) to dark green (oxidized form), and they can be envisioned in the applications of electrochromic materials.
Introduction
Over the last few decades, conducting polymers (CPs) have been developed and utilized for diverse applications1–3 and have become one of the important materials for promoting development and achieving better power conversion efficiencies in the field of organic solar cells.4 The incorporation of transition metals in the CP backbone provides a new research pathway for polymer chemists, because of their diverse applications such as in sensors,5 the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),6 and photochemical7 and photoelectronic devices.8 The strong electronic coupling between the transition-metal centers and the organic CP backbone, their role in molecular architecture, and redox matching facilitating electronic charge transport have been extensively illustrated by Swager and coworkers.9 Extensively, an electropolymerizable thiophene in salen-based metallopolymers enhanced their conductivity through redox-matching, and their electronic properties were investigated.10 Moreover, Chen et al. reported photoluminescent europium-containing conducting metallopolymers with direct electronic communication between the metal center and the polymer backbone.11
N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs)12 have attracted increasing interest owing to their unique architectural diversity, reactivity, and selectivity, which has been utilized in many different types of organic reactions.13–15 NHCs have also been attractive key components in the field of medicinal chemistry.16,17 Notably, NHCs are well known as stabilizing ligands for virtually every transition metal, with strong electron donation from the nitrogen atoms to the carbene–metal bond.18,19 These interesting compounds predominantly enrich organometallic chemistry as ligands for stabilizing metal centers. In particular, NHC ligands have made a significant impact in the area of transition-metal catalysis.20–22 However, the incorporation of NHC ligands has created a new opportunity in polymer chemistry and has been used for diverse applications.23 The presence of NHC monomeric analogs in polymeric material has been shown to afford superior stability and enhanced electrochemical properties.24 NHC–coinage metal25 complexes are widely studied owing to their impressive structural modularity and stability for various material applications. Even though a lot of examples are known for NHC–transition metal complexes as a building block of the backbone of polymeric materials, a complete study of the coinage metals in a conducting polymer material, combined with an NHC building block, has still not been investigated.
Polymer-supported metal complexes (mainly conducting metallopolymers) show interesting properties owing to the synergistic combination of CP processability with the metal ion transport and redox properties of transition metals.26 NHC-based polymer thin films containing Ag and Au displaying highly reversible electrochromic phenomena have been reported by Cowley and coworkers.27 Recently, we reported N-heterocyclic carbene-based gold nanoparticle hybrids and their catalytic activity in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol.28 With the widespread and increasing interest in NHC materials, there is a growing realization that the presence of metal centers in CPs can result in new and valuable properties. To the best of our knowledge, the properties of bithiophene-based conducting NHC–coinage metallopolymers are not known to date. In this study, we describe a series of NHC-containing conducting coinage metallopolymers and investigate their electronic and spectroelectrochemical properties.
Experimental
All the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, TCI, and Alfa Aesar and used without further purification. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer using tetramethylsilane (TMS) or residual solvent as the internal standard. Electrochemical measurements were performed using an Epsilon electrochemical analyzer in a three-electrode cell consisting of a platinum button, platinum wire, and Ag/AgNO3 as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. A 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) was used as the supporting electrolyte. The electrochemical syntheses of the films on a platinum button and on indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass were performed from 2 × 10−3 M monomer solutions. The scan rate was 100 mV s−1. All the electrochemical studies were performed without a nitrogen atmosphere in dry CH2Cl2.

Results and discussion
Inspired by the recent report describing the impact of the design of transition-metal incorporated NHC complexes on their electronic properties,27 our synthetic design involved the incorporation of coinage metals (Cu, Ag, and Au) with NHC into electropolymerizable thiophene moieties. The synthesis of the electropolymerizable monomers is shown in Scheme 1. Palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions are a tremendously effective tool in synthetic chemistry. The Stille cross-coupling reaction of bis(bromophenyl)imidazolium salt 1 with tri-n-butylstannylbithiophene 2 afforded bithiophene-functionalized imidazolium chloride BT–NHC–imd in a good yield. The metalation of BT–NHC–imd with silver(I) acetate in CH2Cl2 furnished BT–NHC–AgCl,20 which was subsequently transmetalated using AuCl in CH2Cl2 to afford the desired BT–NHC–AuCl in a nearly quantitative yield. The copper analog, BT–NHC–CuCl was prepared by a similar transmetalation method. Further, bis(bromophenyl)imidazolium salt 1 undergoes metalation with silver(I) acetate followed by transmetalation with CuCl in CH2Cl2 to form Br–NHC–AgCl and Br–NHC–CuCl, as shown in Scheme 1. The structures of all the synthesized coinage metal-incorporated NHC-based bithiophene complexes were confirmed by 1H, 13C-NMR, and mass spectroscopic methods.

The successful electropolymerizations were performed by the potential-sweep method in a conventional three-electrode configuration. 2 mM solutions of imidazolium salt BT–NHC–imd, BT–NHC–AgCl, BT–NHC–CuCl, and BT–NHC–AuCl in CH2Cl2, with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as a supporting electrolyte, were subjected to electropolymerization onto platinum-button or indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass electrodes by sweeping the potentials from −0.3 to +0.7 V (vs. Fc/Fc+) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, affording the corresponding polymers poly(BT–NHC–imd), poly(BT–NHC–AgCl), poly(BT–NHC–CuCl), and poly(BT–NHC–AuCl), as illustrated in Fig. 1. The counter and reference electrodes were platinum wire and Ag/AgNO3, respectively. When the potential was scanned repeatedly, the current at above the oxidation of the monomers (∼0.6 V vs. Fc/Fc+) increased gradually, indicating the in situ deposition of the polymer films on the electrode surface. The electropolymerizations appeared to occur through oxidative coupling of the bithiophene moieties, since non-thienyl or mono-thienyl analogs (T–Imd and T–NHC–Ms) did not afford polymers under similar conditions. During the electropolymerization of the coinage metal containing monomers along with imidazolium analog BT–NHC–imd, the resulting polymers seemed to behave very similarly to the segmented thiophene polymers (i.e., quaterthiophene moieties are responsible for most of the electroactivity). Nevertheless, there are a few noteworthy points. First, the rate of the film growth of imidazolium analog BT–NHC–imd decreased when compared to other monomers, probably because of the electron-withdrawing ability of the imidazolium group, which could increase the oxidative potential of the monomers. The positive charge inside poly(BT–NHC–imd) may also destabilize the charges (holes) during the electropolymerization. Second, an additional redox couple was observed in the case of the Cu analog, poly(BT–NHC–CuCl), which appeared to be a Cu+/Cu2+ redox reaction of the NHC–Cu moieties. The redox activities of NHC–Ag and NHC–Au did not appear in the potential window during electropolymerization. We attribute this result to the redox matching or mismatching between the quaterthiophene and the NHC–coinage metal moieties in the synthesized thin film polymers.

The extra redox couple of poly(BT–NHC–CuCl) was also evident in the scan-rate measurements of the electropolymerized polymers (Fig. 2c) in a monomer-free electrolyte solution (0.1 M TBAPF6 in CH2Cl2). Investigation of the scan-rate dependence of all the polymers (Fig. 2) shows that the peak current of the electrodeposited film on the Pt-button electrodes increased proportionally with scan rate (Cottrell equation29). Scan rates of up to 200 mV s−1 resulted in no distortion of the electrochemical profiles. When compared to the literature, the redox activities of all the polymers matched well with the development of polaron and bipolaron (radical cation or dication) properties of the quaterthiophene moieties.30

Interestingly, only poly(BT–NHC–CuCl) showed an additional redox couple, probably because of the redox matching between the quaterthiophene moieties and the NHC–Cu complex. To test this hypothesis, the redox activities of NHC–coinage metal complexes (Fig. 3) were investigated. With Br–NHC–AgCl20 in CH2Cl2 (with 0.1 M TBAPF6 as a supporting electrolyte), a reduction peak at approximately −0.6 V (vs. Fc/Fc+) and oxidation peak at approximately −0.4 V (vs. Fc/Fc+) appeared to be for the Ag+/Ag0 couple. Similarly, a redox couple with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of ∼0.3 V (vs. Fc/Fc+) from Br–NHC–CuCl was also observed. Interestingly, notable peaks were not observed in the case of NHC–AuCl, and the oxidation or reduction of which may occur outside the potential window of our measurements. Thus, we concluded that the redox reaction of NHC–Cu(I)/Cu(II) occurred since its redox potential is within those of the quaterthiophene moieties of the polymer backbone (0.1–0.6 V vs. Fc/Fc+ in our experimental conditions) (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, the redox activity of the NHC–Ag complex disappeared in poly(BT–NHC–AgCl). At a potential of less than approximately −0.1 V (vs. Fc/Fc+), the quaterthiophene-containing polymer backbone became insulating, thus limiting charge transport and the reduction of the NHC–Ag moieties (Fig. 3b).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to confirm the successful incorporation of the coinage metals on the polymer thin film of poly(BT–NHC–CuCl), poly(BT–NHC–AgCl), and poly(BT–NHC–AuCl). XPS spectra were obtained for the thin films electropolymerized on ITO-coated glass electrodes. The XPS spectrum of poly(BT–NHC–CuCl) showed four peaks at binding energies of 934, 942, 953, and 962 eV for Cu 2P3/2, and Cu 2P1/2, confirming the incorporation of the NHC–Cu moieties. Similarly, poly(BT–NHC–AgCl) exhibited two signals at binding energies of 374.1 and 368.2 eV for Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2, respectively; poly(BT–NHC–AuCl) showed two peaks at binding energies of 84.6 and 88.3 eV for Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2, respectively (Fig. S1†). The binding energies are very close to the reported values for the Cu, Ag, and Au transition metals, clearly indicating that coinage metals were present in the synthesized polymer thin films. Notably, the NHC–Ag moieties were also incorporated successfully in the polymer despite the fact that the NHC–Ag bond is weak and has been utilized for introducing other metal ions via transmetallation. Moreover, our redox mismatching hypothesis is supported, because the disappearance of the Ag+/Ag0 redox couple in the electropolymerized films could be due to the decomposition of the NHC–Ag complexes. However, the survival of the NHC–Ag moieties during the electropolymerization clearly showed that redox mismatching is responsible for the suppression of the redox couple of NHC–Ag+/Ag0.
The electrochromic properties of the poly(BT–NHC–imd), poly(BT–NHC–AgCl), poly(BT–NHC–CuCl), and poly(BT–NHC–AuCl) thin films were evaluated by spectroelectrochemical analysis (Fig. 4). For these investigations, all the monomers were electropolymerized on ITO-coated glass electrodes under the aforementioned conditions, and the resulting polymers were subjected to UV-vis absorption measurements, while the oxidation levels were increased gradually. During the course of these experiments, all the thin films of the NHC-containing conducting coinage metallopolymers exhibited a remarkable color change. This type of color change is a well-known property of electrochromism owing to the development of polarons and bipolarons along the polythiophene-based polymer main chains.31 Poly(BT–NHC–AgCl), poly(BT–NHC–CuCl) and poly(BT–NHC–AuCl) thin films exhibited absorption at 750 nm for polaron-induced π to π* transitions in the polymer backbone up to oxidation of 1.0 V (vs. Ag/Ag+). For further oxidation up to 1.4 V (vs. Ag/Ag+), the significant absorption in the near IR region belongs to the π to π* transition of the bipolaron excitation of the conjugated metallopolymers. The thin film of poly(BT–NHC–imd) also showed characteristic absorbances similar to the NHC-containing conducting metallopolymers. Hence, these materials can be used in electrochromic devices owing to their rapid redox switch ability and drastic color change from orange-yellow to dark-green (insets Fig. 4). The electrochemical, XPS, and spectroelectrochemistry studies collectively support the structure of the synthesized NHC-containing conducting coinage metallopolymers.

Conclusion
In summary, monomers of bis-thiophene with NHCs containing the coinage metals copper, silver, and gold were synthesized using the Stille cross-coupling reaction and confirmed by standard spectroscopy techniques. The coinage metal-incorporated NHC–bithiophene based monomers were successfully electropolymerized to afford polymer thin films, which were characterized using a range of techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, XPS, and spectroelectrochemistry. The entire polymerization process did not require an inert atmosphere. We have found that among the thiophene based NHC–coinage metal complexes, the copper redox couple Cu+/Cu2+ matched with quaterthiophene moieties of the polymer backbone. The prepared polymer thin films exhibited excellent electrochromic properties. In the polymer thin film, the NHC–coinage metal complexes are involved in stabilizing and enhancing the electronic properties of conjugated metallopolymeric materials. Collectively, these results are promising for the development of a new class of electrochromic materials.
