    , Accepted 7th October 2016First published on 10th October 2016AbstractA simple route for the preparation of ZnS nanocrystal/reduced graphene oxide (ZnS/RGO) by a hydrothermal synthesis process was achieved. The chemical composition, morphology, and structural characterization reveal that the ZnS/RGO composite is composed of sphalerite-phased ZnS nanocrystals uniformly dispersed on functional RGO sheets with a high specific surface area. The ZnS/RGO composite was utilized as an anode in the construction of a high-performance lithium-ion battery. The ZnS/RGO composite with appropriate RGO content exhibits a high reversible specific capacity (780 mA h g−1), excellent cycle stability over 100 cycles (71.3% retention), and good rate performance at 2C (51.2% of its capacity when measured at a 0.1C rate). To further investigate this ZnS/RGO anode for practical use in full Li-ion cells, we tested the electrochemical performance of the ZnS/RGO anode at different cut-off voltages for the first time. The presence of RGO plays an important role in providing high conductivity as well as a substrate with a high surface area. This helps alleviate the typically problems associated with volume expansion and shrinkage during prolonged cycling. Additionally, the RGO provides multiple nucleation points that result in a uniformly dispersed film of nanosized ZnS that covers its surface. Thus, the high surface area RGO enables high electronic conductivity and fast charge transfer kinetics for ZnS lithiation/delithiation.
Introduction
With the growing demands of various energy consumption devices, a great deal of effort has been made to develop new materials as electrodes for lithium ion batteries with higher specific capacity, better conductivity, and better cycling stability.1–3 Metal sulfides have been studied as suitable alternatives to replace current commercial graphite anodes because of their high theoretical capacities, low cost, and high abundance in nature.4,5 Furthermore, with regard to electrochemical reaction processes, there are two benefits of metal sulfides as anodes for lithium ion batteries. First, the reactions of transition metal sulfide electrodes involve two or more electrons per 3d metal as compared with only one electron for the six carbons in the commonly used graphite anodes. This greatly improves the lithiation/delithiation capacity. Second, the potential of the transition metal sulfides versus Li/Li+ can be tuned continuously from 0 to 3.5 V depending on the ion covalence of the bonding between the transition metal and the sulfide. This allows one to design for energy and test for rate capability in the design of new electrodes.
Among the members of the metal sulfide family, zinc sulfide (ZnS) is an important, non-toxic II–VI semiconductor occurring in nature as cubic sphalerite and hexagonal wurtzite with tetrahedrally bonded Zn2+, and has been widely explored as a photovoltaic/photocatalyst6–8 material in various devices such as solar cells,9–11 light-emitting diodes,12–14 lasers,15,16 and sensors.17–19 Recently, it has attracted attention due to its electrochemical performance as an electrode for lithium ion batteries. Wang et al. reported the performance of ZnS electrodes, prepared by a chemical reaction method, exhibiting a reversible lithium storage capacity of about 400 mA h g−1 at a charge/discharge current density of 0.05 mA cm−2.20 However, the ZnS electrodes suffer from poor capacity stability, which may be caused by their low electrical conductivity and dramatic volume expansion/shrinkage during lithiation/delithiation. To address these issues, hybridization of ZnS with carbonaceous materials has been investigated. Xiao-Zhen Liao, Zi-Feng Ma and co-workers reported ZnS/C composites synthesized through a combined precipitation process which showed stable capacity at 304.4 mA h g−1 at a current density of 400 mA g−1.21 Zhian Zhang's research group synthesized a ZnS/porous-carbon composite (ZnS/PC) via a facile synthesis method involving a metal–organic framework (MOF) strategy.22 The as-obtained ZnS/PC exhibited a reversible capacity of 438 mA h g−1 over 300 cycles at 100 mA g−1. Nevertheless, neither pure ZnS nor ZnS/C composites demonstrated anything close to the theoretical capacity (about 850–900 mA h g−1 of ZnS).
To further improve the electrochemical performance of the ZnS/C composite, graphene was substituted for the porous carbon. Substituting graphene, a sp2-hybridized, two-dimensional layered carbon,23–26 is found to be one of the most effective ways to improve the cathode or anode performance of the active materials.27,28 Graphene works as a highly conductive, flexible, high surface area and chemically stabile support29 to which ZnS particles are anchored. Jung-Kul Lee and Yun Chan Kang's group30 synthesized ZnS–reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composite powder by spray pyrolysis with a discharge capacity of 437 mA h g−1 after 700 cycles. Taihong Wang and co-workers31 prepared ZnS/graphene composites by a facile solvothermal process. Their ZnS/graphene composite exhibited discharge and charge capacities of 570 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1. Though decent, the specific capacity and capability of the ZnS/graphene composite anode can still be further improved to meet the needs of high-capacity and high-power energy storage devices.
In the present work, we report a simple, single-step, hydrothermal synthesis of a ZnS–reduced graphene oxide (ZnS–graphene) composite material consisting of nanocrystalline ZnS clusters anchored to electrically conductive graphene sheets. With graphene sheets as the supporting surface layer, ZnS crystalline particles precipitate as nano-sized domains. The graphene works as an electronic conductor and a mechanical stress buffer to enable electron transfer during lithiation/delithiation and as a high surface area medium by which the ZnS can maintain its surface area after cycling. The initial charge–discharge capacity, reversible discharge capacity, and high-rate performance of the ZnS–graphene composite anode we prepared improved the performance of ZnS dramatically which is even higher than that in previous reports on ZnS/RGO anodes. Furthermore, to investigate this ZnS/RGO anode for practical use in full Li-ion cells, we also tested the electrochemical performance of the ZnS/RGO anode at different cut-off voltages.
Experimental section
Reagents and chemicals
KMnO4, concentrated H2SO4 (98 wt%), aqueous HCl (3 wt%), H2O2 (30 wt%), aqueous ammonia (25 wt%), Zn(Ac)2·2H2O, graphite, and L-cysteine ((+)-2-amino-3-mercaptopropionic acid) were purchased from Tianjin Kewei Corporation, China. Acetylene black (AB) was purchased from Denka, Japan. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was purchased from Kureha America Inc., US. N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, anhydrous, 99.5 wt%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc., US. The Celgard 2400 separator was obtained from Celgard, US. The lithium-ion electrolyte was purchased from BASF, including 1.2 mol L−1 LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate, and diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC = 3/7 w/w) containing 30 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). Lithium foil was purchased from FMC-Lithium Corporation. All the reagents and chemicals were used without further purification.
Synthesis of ZnS nanocrystal/reduced graphene oxide (ZnS/RGO) composites
10 mg of graphene oxide (GO, for the preparation of GO see the ESI†) was added to 20 mL of deionized water and ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min (KQ2200DE, Kunshan Ultrasonic Instruments Corporation, China). Then 0.1 g of Zn(Ac)2·2H2O (0.46 mmol) was added to the GO dispersion and stirred for 10 min. This was followed by the addition of 0.17 g of L-cysteine (1.38 mmol). Meanwhile, aqueous ammonia (25 wt%) was added dropwise slowly into the mixed solution until the pH was between 9.0 and 10.0. The two mixtures were then stirred continuously for 30 min. After that, 20 mL of the above mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Heating was performed at 180 °C for 12 h under autogenous pressure, followed by cooling by natural convection to room temperature. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed thoroughly with alcohol and deionized water several times. Finally, the as-prepared material was dried at 80 °C under vacuum overnight. The ZnS material was prepared following the same procedure but without the addition of GO. To investigate the effects of different amounts of RGO in ZnS/RGO composites, lower RGO contents of 4 mg and 10 mg and higher RGO contents of 200 mg and 400 mg were employed in the above preparation method. The actual RGO weight ratios in the ZnS/RGO composites were estimated from the results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). For convenience, the samples prepared with low RGO contents of 4 mg and 10 mg are labeled ZnS/L1-RGO and ZnS/L2-RGO, respectively; the samples prepared with high RGO contents of 200 mg and 400 mg are labeled ZnS/H1-RGO and ZnS/H2-RGO, respectively.
Material characterization
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed under air using a TGA Q600 system (TA Instruments, US). The sample was heated from room temperature to 800 °C at 10 °C min−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were taken on a Bruker D8A X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) using CuKα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained on a Nicolet IR200 automatic infrared spectrometer (Thermo, US). N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were collected at liquid nitrogen temperatures using a TriStar II 3020 surface area and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, US). The pore size distribution was determined by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The XPS measurements were performed on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (PHI-5000, US) using a monochromatic AlKα (1486.7 eV) source at a voltage of 15 kV and an emission current of 10 mA. The morphologies of the products were characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Nova at Tianjin Normal University, and JSM-7500F at the National Center for Electron Microscopy at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20, Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands).
Electrode fabrication and cell assembly
The as-prepared ZnS/RGO composites were tested as anode materials for lithium ion batteries. In detail, PVDF was first dissolved in NMP. Upon complete dissolution, the ZnS/graphene and AB were added to the binder–solvent solution. The weight ratio of ZnS/graphene, AB, and PVDF was set at 80:10:10. The mixture was subject to mechanical stirring for 2 h to form a uniform slurry. The slurry was then coated on a 18 μm-thick battery grade copper sheet using a Mitutoyo doctor blade and an Elcometer motorized film applicator. The typical mass loading of the active material was about 1.0 mg cm−2 of ZnS/graphene. After the NMP dried off, the electrode laminate was further dried in a vacuum at 50 °C overnight. The specific capacity of the electrode is based on the total mass of the ZnS/RGO composite.
2325-type coin cells (parts from National Research Council of Canada) were assembled in an argon-filled glove box with an oxygen concentration of 0.1 ppm and a dew point of −70 °C. The ZnS/graphene electrode was punched to 9/16′′ OD and the counter electrode was a lithium metal disk of 11/16′′ OD.
Cell testing
Galvanostatic cycling tests were performed on a Maccor Series 4000 Battery Test system in a thermal chamber at 30 °C. The cut-off potential of cell testing was set at 0.01 V to 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) test was performed on a VMP galvanostat/potentiostat workstation (Bio-Logic Inc., US) at a scan rate of 0.02 mV s−1 at a potential interval 0.01 and 3.0 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also conducted on a VMP workstation with a frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz. Cells were cycled at a current density of 100 mA g−1 for 1 cycle, then brought to half lithiation for the 2nd cycle and allowed to stand for 4 hours before EIS measurements were carried out.
Results and discussion
The formation mechanism of the as-prepared ZnS/RGO composites prepared via hydrothermal synthesis is shown in Fig. 1. In this study, zinc acetate is selected as the zinc source material; L-cysteine is selected as the sulfur source. During the hydrothermal synthesis, the positive Zn2+ from the zinc acetate bonds with the negative oxygen-containing group on the surface of the RGO sheets via van der Waals forces. Then, the negative S2− from L-cysteine rapidly bonds with the Zn2+ loaded on the graphene sheets to form spherical ZnS nanocrystals with a sphalerite structure. The surface of the graphene sheets provides the ZnS with nucleation sites, resulting in a uniform dispersion of nanosized ZnS particles that cover the graphene sheet. Moreover, the RGO sheets are electronically conductive which is beneficial for the electrochemical conversion of the ZnS. From the photos of ZnS and ZnS/RGO samples in Fig. 1, one observes (in the upper right corner) that the pure ZnS powder is pale yellow in color, however, with increasing fraction of RGO, the color of the ZnS/RGO product becomes darker and darker, from deep yellow to brown, to black, and finally to dark black (lower left corner).

To quantify the amount of RGO in the ZnS/RGO composites, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out in oxygen at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The mass loss which is observed below 250 °C for the materials with a high fraction of RGO (Fig. 2a) most likely corresponds to the loss of water: desorption of physically absorbed water on the ZnS/RGO composites.32 As the TGA indicates, the weight loss of pure ZnS between 570 and 680 °C is ascribed to the oxidation of ZnS to ZnO. For the ZnS/RGO materials, there are two weight loss ranges: one for the temperature from 250 to 570 °C, and the other from 570 to 680 °C. The former is attributed to the removal of carbon-containing groups33–35 (see Fig. S1 of the ESI,† TGA of graphene oxide in oxygen at a rate of 10 °C min−1); hence, as the fraction of RGO increases, the amount of weight loss increases. Following from that argument, there is no weight loss in this temperature range for the pure ZnS powder. The latter weight loss range is again ascribed to the oxidation process of ZnS to ZnO. This is consistent with no distinguishable endothermic peak from 570 to 680 °C of the DSC data (Fig. 2b) for the ZnS/H2-RGO as this material contains the lowest fraction of ZnS. Above 680 °C, the only material left is ZnO from which we can estimate the actual ZnS content in the original composite. According to the transformation of ZnO to ZnS with a 119.7 wt% change,31 the actual ratios of ZnS in the ZnS/L1-RGO, ZnS/L2-RGO, ZnS/H1-RGO, and ZnS/H2-RGO composites taking into consideration adsorbed water are 91.50 wt%, 82.66 wt%, 27.32 wt%, and 16.47 wt%, respectively. Accordingly, the weights of RGO in the ZnS/RGO composites are equal to the total weight loss minus the fraction of absorbed water and ZnS. Based on this, the calculated weights of RGO in the final composites are 7.21 wt%, 14.38 wt%, 63.37 wt%, and 74.76 wt%, respectively. A comparison of the estimates from the TGA with the measured amounts of RGO in the preparation is provided in Table 1.

The XRD patterns of the pure ZnS and ZnS/RGO composites with different weight ratios of RGO are shown in Fig. 2c. The ZnS/L1-RGO and ZnS/L2-RGO composites show similar XRD patterns to the pure ZnS. The peaks of these three composites can be attributed to the standard values of the sphalerite crystal structure (JCPDS No. 05-0566) (ignoring peaks from impurities). Moreover, no diffraction peaks for RGO can be observed in the ZnS/L1-RGO and ZnS/L2-RGO composites, which is due to the low quantity and relatively low diffraction intensity of RGO in the composite. As for the ZnS composites with higher RGO contents (ZnS/H1-RGO and ZnS/H2-RGO), the peaks in the XRD patterns are broad, which indicates the nanocrystallinity of ZnS in those composites.
The FTIR spectra of graphene oxide (GO), ZnS, ZnS/L2-RGO, and ZnS/H2-RGO composites are shown in Fig. 2d. For the GO, the strong and broad absorption peak of GO composites located at around 3411 and 1401 cm−1 can be assigned to the stretching vibrations and the deformation of the O–H bond, respectively.36 The broad adsorption peaks at around 1734, 1626, and 1196 cm−1 are, respectively, attributed to the characteristic stretching vibrations of CC,37,38 CO,39 and C–OH,40 respectively. The absorption peaks at around 1057, 866, and 583 cm−1 are due to the epoxide groups situated at the edge of the GO sheets.41 Whereas for the ZnS/L2-RGO and ZnS/H2-RGO, the adsorption peaks at 3411, 3125, 1626, and 1401 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of O–H, N–H, and CO, and the deformation vibration of O–H, respectively.42,43 The N–H bond may be from the aqueous ammonia present in the preparation process, this can also be found in the pure ZnS sample. Compared with the absorption peaks of the oxygen-containing groups in GO, the epoxide groups are absent and the intensity of the absorption peaks for CO dramatically decreased. This indicates that the hydrothermal reduction has removed most parts of the oxygen containing groups from GO, and the majority of GO has been reduced to RGO during the hydrothermal reaction.
The porosity of the ZnS and ZnS/RGO composites was estimated by N2 adsorption–desorption analysis, as shown in Fig. 2e. The ZnS/H2-RGO exhibits a type-IV isotherm with a hysteresis loop in the relative pressure range of 0.8 to 1.0,44,45 indicative of an inhomogeneous mesoporous structure. While the ZnS, ZnS/L1-RGO, ZnS/L2-RGO, and ZnS/H1-RGO composites demonstrate no such hysteresis loop in the same relative pressure range. This suggests that these materials are more homogeneously porous than the ZnS/H2-RGO. The pore size distribution curves of the ZnS and ZnS/RGO composites, calculated from the adsorption branch by the BJH method, are shown in Fig. 2f. The BET surface area of the samples is shown in Table 2. Both the BET surface area and the average pore size of the ZnS/RGO composites are larger than those of pure ZnS, which indicates that the ZnS/RGO composites can provide a larger interface to enhance the contact between the electrolyte and the active material and facilitate lithium insertion and desertion charge transfer. Among the four composites, the ZnS/H1-RGO has the largest pore sizes, which further benefits the Li+ intercalation and deintercalation process.

The morphologies of the pure ZnS, ZnS/RGO composites, and RGO materials were characterized by SEM with the images shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S2 in the ESI.† As for pure ZnS (Fig. 3a), it exhibits on a submicron scale a uniform sphere-like morphology with aggregation resulting in the formation of large chunks. However, with the increasing content of RGO in the composites (from Fig. 3b–e), the size of ZnS particles decreases, indicating that graphene sheets increase the number of nucleation sites for ZnS which leads to the formation of ZnS with small particle sizes. Meanwhile, the dispersion of ZnS nanoparticles hinders the collapse and restacking of graphene sheets during the hydrothermal reduction procedure. In detail, the graphene nanosheets can be clearly seen in ZnS/RGO composites (Fig. 3c–e) except for the ZnS/L1-RGO composite with low content of RGO (Fig. 3b). In the ZnS/RGO composite with lower content of RGO (ZnS/L1-RGO and ZnS/L2-RGO), the ZnS particles are tightly anchored and cover the entire surface of the graphene sheets. In the ZnS/RGO composite with higher content of RGO (ZnS/H1-RGO in Fig. 3d and Fig. S2a, b, ESI†), the ZnS particles are uniformly dispersed on the surface of graphene sheets. Both of them indicate a good interfacial contact between the ZnS nanoparticles and the two-dimensional (2D) graphene sheets (Fig. S2c and d, ESI†). While in the ZnS/RGO composite with the highest content of RGO (ZnS/H2-RGO in Fig. 3e), the ZnS particles are so small and sparsely dispersed on the surface of graphene sheets that they cannot be clearly identified. Compared with the surface of pure RGO (Fig. 3f), the surface of the graphene layers in the ZnS/RGO composite (Fig. 3d and e) is rougher and exhibits porous surfaces, which corresponds to a large surface area and porous structures, consistent with the BET analysis described previously.

To obtain microscopic morphology and structural information, high-resolution TEM analysis of the ZnS/H1-RGO composite was performed, as shown in Fig. 4. It can be observed from the low-magnification TEM image (Fig. 4a) that the 2D structure of the graphene sheets with many wrinkles can be clearly distinguished which indicates that the RGO has been well reduced in the hydrothermal process. Moreover, there is a dispersion of nanosized ZnS spheres on the surface of the RGO sheet support. Fig. 4b shows a magnified TEM image of ZnS/H1-RGO in which an embedded crystal lattice can be clearly seen, identified with short-dashed rings on the graphene layers. From Fig. 4c, the lattice spacing is about 0.1912 nm which is confirmed to be the (220) crystal plane of sphalerite ZnS. Also in Fig. 4c, the graphite lattice (002) is observed to be closely attached to the ZnS lattice, which suggests an intimate interfacial contact between the graphene and ZnS. Because of the good electronic conductivity of graphene, such an intimate interfacial contact is expected to lead to good electron and Li+ transfer during charge/discharge cycling. Besides, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern also indicates that the ZnS nanosphere is well crystallized in the ZnS/H1-RGO composite, which is in accordance with the result of XRD analysis in Fig. 2c.

XPS measurements were carried out to further determine the chemical composition and identify the chemical status of the ZnS/RGO composites. The ZnS/H1-RGO was selected for this example (Fig. 5), and, for comparison, the XPS patterns of the pure ZnS are also provided (Fig. S3 of the ESI†). Fig. 5a provides the XPS survey spectra of the ZnS/H1-RGO sample in which the peaks of Zn2p, S2p, C1s, O1s, and N1s can be clearly observed. The N element in the composite likely comes from the aqueous ammonia present in the preparation process and may be bonded to an oxygen-group on the surface of the RGO sheet. As shown in Fig. 5b, the C1s spectrum of the sample exhibits four peaks that correspond to carbon atoms in different functional groups. The independent peaks with binding energies of 284.6, 285.1, 286.7, and 289.9 eV are attributed to the extensively delocalized sp2-hybridized C–C, C–O, CO, and O–CO groups, respectively.46,47 This indicates that the oxygen-containing groups have not been completely removed from the GO during hydrothermal synthesis. The Zn 2p3 spectrum of ZnS/H1-RGO (Fig. 5c) displays characteristic peaks at 1021.7 and 1044.7 eV, corresponding to the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 spin orbit peaks of the ZnS phase.48,49 The presence of ZnS can be further confirmed by the S2p spectrum (Fig. 5d) with the characteristic peaks at 161.5 and 162.9 eV, which correspond to the S2p3/2 and S2p1/2 peaks in the ZnS phase.50,51 The area ratio of spin–orbit splitting S2p3/2 and S2p1/2 is not similar to that of the S2p spectrum of the pure ZnS (Fig. S3c of the ESI†), which may be attributed to some chemical bonds or physical interaction between the S atoms and the RGO surface. Therefore, the above XPS results suggest that the ZnS particles synthesized on the surface of the RGO with some oxygen-containing groups still remaining. Table 3 shows the atomic percentage of elements on the surface of ZnS/H1-RGO compared with the pure ZnS samples determined by XPS analysis.

Fig. 6a shows the first cycle performance of the pure ZnS and ZnS/RGO composite anodes at a current density of 100 mA g−1 with the cut-off voltages of 0.01 to 3.0 V. As shown, the charge and discharge potential plateaus of the pure ZnS anode are short, which indicates low specific capacity, while the charge and discharge potential plateaus of ZnS/RGO anodes are significantly longer, which reflects higher specific capacity. The initial specific delithiation capacities of the ZnS/RGO composites with increasing RGO content are 682.74, 851.97, 1088.65, and 774.58 mA h g−1, respectively. This indicates that the ZnS/RGO anodes have much higher practical capacity than the pure ZnS (385.70 mA h g−1). Among the ZnS/RGO composite anodes, the ZnS/H1-RGO has the highest initial specific capacity, 2.8 times greater that of the pure ZnS. For ZnS/RGO composites with lower contents of RGO (ZnS/L1-RGO and ZnS/L2-RGO), there is an obvious charge potential plateau in the range of 1.2 to 1.3 V that corresponds to the delithiation process in the range of 0.6 to 0.9 V. For ZnS/RGO composites with higher contents of RGO (ZnS/H1-RGO and ZnS/H2-RGO), the potential curves are different. There is no obvious charge and discharge potential plateau. That phenomenon suggests that the electrochemical behavior of the composites with lower contents of RGO is similar to that of the pure ZnS anode, while the composites with higher contents of RGO are much more like those of the pure RGO.

Fig. 6b shows the cycle performance of pure ZnS and ZnS/RGO composite anodes at charge and discharge current densities of 100 mA g−1. After 100 charge and discharge cycles, the specific delithiation capacity of the ZnS/RGO anodes in the order of increasing RGO remains at 415, 554, 776, and 638 mA h g−1. The cycle stability of the pure ZnS is less satisfactory, as the capacity drops to 147.09 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. The addition of RGO clearly improves the cycle stability of the anode. The ZnS/RGO anodes show outstanding performance, among which, the ZnS/H1-RGO anode shows the best cycle stability and reversible capacity. From the 1st to the 5th cycles, the delithiation decay of the ZnS/H1-RGO anode is 11.1% lower than that of the pure ZnS anode over the same cycle range. The 5th delithiation capacity of ZnS/H1-RGO is still up at 779 mA h g−1 and remains the same value until the 100th cycle. However, the decay of delithiation capacity of the pure ZnS is severe until the 30th cycle. The total capacity decay (from the 1st cycle to stable cycling) of the ZnS/H1-RGO anode is 39.47% lower than that of pure ZnS. The excellent cycle stability of the ZnS/RGO composite anodes is attributed to the RGO in the composite which not only acts as an alleviation buffer for preventing the electrode structure from collapsing during Li+ lithiation/delithiation, but also as a means for uninterrupted electronic conduction.
To further demonstrate that the potential range for cycling ZnS is between 0 and 3 V, the ZnS/H1-RGO anode with cut-off voltage ranges of 0.01 to 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 V was examined. Fig. 6c shows the potential vs. specific capacity of the first cycle for the ZnS/H1-RGO anode at a current density of 100 mA g−1 with different cut-off potentials. As shown, the charge and discharge capacity plateaus are both below 2.0 V, indicating that 2.0 V is sufficient to complete the electrochemical reaction of the ZnS anode.

Fig. 6d shows the cycle performance of the ZnS/H1-RGO anode under the same charge and discharge conditions with different cut-off potentials. The specific reversible capabilities are approximately 800, 600, 300, and 200 mA h g−1 corresponding to the cut-off potential range of 0.01 to 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 V, respectively.
In Li-ion full cells, the anode should work at low voltage, therefore, we tested the ZnS/RGO anode in the potential range of 0 to 2 V. Fig. 6e shows the potential vs. specific capacity of the first cycle for the pure ZnS and ZnS/RGO anodes at a current density of 100 mA g−1 with the cut-off voltage range of 0.01 to 2.0 V. Except for the cut-off voltage, these curves are similar to those of the ZnS/RGO anode in the cut-off potential range of 0.01 to 3.0 V (Fig. 6c). Fig. 6f provides the cycle performance of the pure ZnS and ZnS/RGO anodes with the cut-off potential range of 0.01 to 2.0 V. Among them, the ZnS/H1-RGO has the highest charge and discharge capacity and most stable cycle stability.
Cyclic voltammetry profiles of the pure ZnS and ZnS/RGO anodes at a scan rate of 0.02 mV s−1 for the first and second scanned cycle are shown in Fig. 7. Comparing the curves between the first cycle and the second cycle provides additional information on their reversible capacity, which may be attributed to the irreversible reaction involved in the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, owing to the reductive decomposition of the electrolyte during the first scanning process.52 During the negative scan, there are several cathodic peaks for all of the anodes, which appear below 0.8 V, and are related to the lithiation of ZnS to metallic zinc and the further formation of Zn–Li alloys through multiple steps. During the positive scan, the anodic peaks of the pure ZnS (Fig. 7a) are observed in the range of 0.25 to 0.75 V, while for the ZnS/L1-RGO (Fig. 7b), ZnS/L2-RGO (Fig. 7c), and ZnS/H1-RGO (Fig. 7d) composites, three distinct peaks appear in the range of 0.25 to 1.75 V. For ZnS/H2-RGO (Fig. 7e), one distinct peak appears at 1.25 V, and two faint peaks at around 1.75 and 2.25 V. These anodic peaks correspond to the oxidation or delithiation process of Li–Zn alloys (such as LiZn4, Li2Zn5, LiZn2, Li2Zn3, and LiZn, etc.), which is a multi-step process.53 The most obvious oxidation peak at 1.36 V is attributed to the reconstruction of ZnS to form Zn and Li2S.54,55 Comparison of these five electrodes points out the differences between them, and indicates that the increase of RGO in the ZnS/RGO improves the reversible properties of the ZnS electrochemical lithiation/delithiation process of the ZnS anode by the interaction between the surface of RGO and the nanocrystal ZnS particles. Moreover, because the main anodic and cathodic peaks appear in the range of 0 to 2 V, the potential range of 0 to 2 V versus Li/Li+ is enough for charge–discharge cycling to obtain most of the specific capacities.

As Fig. 8a shows, EIS was carried out to evaluate the electrochemical kinetic properties of the pure ZnS and ZnS/RGO materials at 50% depth of discharge (DOD), and their equivalent circuit for EIS data fitting. The Nyquist plots for all the electrodes consist of one semicircle and a straight line, which are associated with charge transfer and the solid state diffusion process of lithium ions in the anode and are referred to as the Warburg region. The EIS data were fitted to an electrochemical model using the ZView module from Sai software set.56–58 The fitting model is an equivalent circuit electrochemical model, which is depicted in Fig. 8b. Rs at the high-frequency intercept on the real axis represents the bulk resistance depending on the electrolyte solution, active material, current collector and so on. Rp was the charge transfer resistance at the anode–electrolyte interface, associated with the interface between the electrolyte and the active particles.59,60 The constant phase element (CPE) replaces the conventional double-layer and passivation film capacitance.61Ws is the finite length Warburg impedance with a short circuit terminus.62Table 4 shows the EIS fitting results of pure ZnS and ZnS/RGO anodes. No distinct difference exists in the Rs value of the five samples, indicating that the cells have the same test conditions. The charge transfer resistance (Rp) of the ZnS/RGO composite electrodes is smaller than that of the pure ZnS electrode, indicating the higher electrochemical activity and better utilization of the electrodes. To further compare the lithium diffusion kinetics in the ZnS/RGO composite electrodes with that of the pure ZnS electrode, one can calculate the lithium diffusion coefficient (DLi+) using the following equation:63,64  where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, n is the number of transferred electrons, F is the Faraday constant, A is the surface area of the electrode, C is the concentration of Li+ in the electrode, and σ is the Warburg factor. Calculating the DLi+ values of the pure ZnS, ZnS/L1-RGO, ZnS/L2-RGO, ZnS/H1-RGO, and ZnS/H2-RGO electrodes one arrives at 7.86 × 10−16, 3.41 × 10−15, 3.34 × 10−14, 1.39 × 10−13, and 3.90 × 10−14 cm2 S−1, respectively, which indicates that the lithium diffusion in ZnS/RGO composite electrodes is faster than that in a pure ZnS electrode. This further demonstrates that the ZnS/RGO composite electrodes have good lithium intercalation kinetics, corresponding to improved high-rate performance.

According to the previous study and our electrochemical performance data, the electrochemical lithiation/delithiation process of ZnS should proceed as illustrated in the following two steps:ZnS + 2Li ↔ Zn + Li2SZn + Li ↔ LiZn
In the discharge process, at first Li+ inserts in the ZnS to form the Zn and Li2S; this is followed by the lithium ion insertion continuously and the formation of Li–Zn alloys. During charge, the process is reversed, the Li–Zn alloys decompose as the lithium ion de-inserts from it, and finally Zn from the Li–Zn alloy becomes the ZnS. The discharge/charge (lithiation/delithiation) processes are reversible, exhibiting in two reversible chemical reactions. The total number of transferred electrons in the two chemical reactions is three, making the theoretical capacity of ZnS about 825 mA h g−1. This value slightly matches the stable specific capacity of our ZnS/H1-RGO (Fig. 6b, 776 mA h g−1). That is to say, RGO in our ZnS/RGO composites decreased the irreversible capacity of pure ZnS, and maximally improved the electrochemical activity of ZnS in the lithiation/delithiation process, resulting in high specific capacity and excellent cycling stability.
The reasons why the RGO improved the specific capacity, cycle stability, and high-rate performance of the ZnS/RGO anode may be as follows: first, the RGO sheets provide nucleus formation sites for ZnS in the chemical preparation process, resulting in the synthesis of the ZnS nanocrystals which have more active surface and lower expansion during charge/discharge. The ZnS nanosizing significantly improves its specific capacity as an anode for lithium-ion batteries. Second, in the charge/discharge process, the RGO sheets can alleviate the structural expansion and shrinkage of the electrode, improving the cycle stability. Third, the good electronic conductivity of the RGO sheets can benefit the transfer of both electrons and lithium ions during the charge/discharge processes. As a result, the electrochemical reactions of the active materials can proceed more quickly and sufficiently, resulting in the improvement of the high-rate performance of the electrode.
Although there are lots of advantages for RGO in ZnS/RGO composites, the weight content of RGO should be controlled to obtain excellent electrochemical performance. Among our ZnS/RGO samples, the ZnS/H1-RGO has the best performance as an anode for lithium-ion batteries. The appropriate content of RGO can disperse the ZnS nanocrystals uniformly, and make the electron transfer path most efficient. Otherwise, too low a content of RGO in the composites does not provide enough RGO sheets to adequately perform the job, and too much content of RGO dilutes the impact on a weight basis. Following work should focus on the precise handling of the weight ratio of RGO and ZnS in the preparation of ZnS/RGO composites to further improve the electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the reaction between the RGO sheets and ZnS nanocrystals should be investigated by in situ structure analysis methods to further reveal the role of RGO in the lithiation/delithiation processes.
Conclusion
The ZnS nanocrystal/RGO composites were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. The results of structure and morphology analyses show that the ZnS/RGO composite is composed of sphalerite phased ZnS nanocrystals dispersed uniformly on functional RGO sheets which serve as a particle growth supporter and controller. As an anode material for lithium ion batteries, the ZnS/RGO composite with appropriate RGO content exhibits high reversible specific capacity, excellent cyclability, and good rate performance, the values of which are dramatically higher than those of the pure ZnS anode. The enhanced electrochemical performance is mainly due to the presence of RGO which plays an important role in providing high conductivity as well as a mechanical buffer that alleviates the effects of volume expansion and contraction during charge and discharge cycling, maintaining the cycle life, high coulombic efficiency, and fast kinetics of ZnS anode. We believe that the ZnS/RGO nanocomposite has great potential to be employed as an alternative anode material in lithium ion batteries. Moreover, our simple and practical strategy can also be applied to explore various other nanocomposite materials for many kinds of energy storage devices.
