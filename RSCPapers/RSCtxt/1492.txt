    , Accepted 2nd February 2021First published on 3rd February 2021AbstractVertically stacked layered metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as promising semiconductors for optoelectronic applications due to their low cost, tunable band gaps, and excellent stability and solution processability. However, it is still a challenge to find potential layered MHPs with both high stability and superior optoelectronic properties. Herein, we employ a hierarchical screening method to search for layered lead-free MHPs based on density functional theory calculations. This method leads to a sequential screening of MHPs from their bulks, nanosheets, to layered structures, aiming to solve the problem of lead toxicity and balance the stability and optoelectronic performance. After a series of screenings, Dion–Jacobson phase (CH2)8(NH3)2Csn−1SnnBr3n+1 compounds are predicted as a class of layered lead-free perovskites with high stability, appropriate band gaps, and small carrier effective masses. Furthermore, an improved model is proposed to predict the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of these layered perovskites. Owing to the optimal band gaps and large absorption coefficient in the visible region, Dion–Jacobson phase perovskites exhibit high PCE (>20%) when the layer number of SnBr6 octahedrons is beyond 2, suggesting their huge potential for photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are an emerging class of semiconductor materials with huge potential for the development of high-performance optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells,1,2 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),3,4 lasers,5 and photodetectors6 due to their low-cost solution synthesis, tunable band gaps, large absorption coefficients, long carrier lifetimes, and superior defect tolerance.7,8 With the advance of device structure and synthetic processing, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of lead (Pb) based perovskite solar cells rapidly climbed from the initial 3.8% to 25.2%9,10 and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) improved from less than 1% to more than 20%.11,12 Despite the great progress of MHP-based devices, two key factors limit these materials for large-scale commercial applications. One of the serious issues is the toxic Pb element contained in most of the high-performance MHP-based devices.13 The other issue is poor long-term stability of MHP materials, especially under heating and humidity conditions.14,15 Thus, it is of significant importance to find highly stable Pb-free MHPs with superior electronic and optical properties.
In order to overcome the limitation of instability, several feasible strategies were proposed to improve the stability of MHP-based devices, including the transmutation of cations,16 introduction of a passivation layer,17 and synthesis of low-dimensional MHPs.18,19 Among these approaches, the synthesis of low-dimensional MHPs was widely regarded as a better way to enhance their stability. For instance, multilayer nanosheets obtained by vertically stacking two-dimensional (2D) MHPs exhibit higher environmental stability in comparison to their bulk counterparts.20,21 This is because hydrophobic organic cations of these layered MHPs can resist the penetration of water and oxygen molecules into the perovskite lattice and suppress the ion mobility of the inorganic layer.22 According to the charge of organic spacer cations and interlayer stacking modes, these layered MHPs can be divided into the Ruddlesden–Popper (R–P) phase with the formula of A′2An−1BnX3n+1 and the Dion–Jacobson (D–J) phase with the formula of A′′An−1BnX3n+1.23 Here A′ and A′′ are the monovalent and divalent long-chain organic spacer cations, respectively, n is an integer that corresponds to the thickness of inorganic BX64− octahedron layers, and A, B, and X are a small organic cation or alkaline metal cation, a group IVA metal, and a halogen, respectively. Owing to the interlayer coupling via relatively weak van der Waals (vdW) and hydrogen (H) bonding interactions, these layered perovskites have a greater synthetic and structural versatility.24 By engineering the composition and type of organic spacer cations, the layered perovskites can be obtained with different thicknesses (i.e., n values).25 The reduction of thickness leads to the increase of band gaps and exciton-binding energies in these materials due to quantum and dielectric confinements, which creates a large freedom to tune their optoelectronic properties.26
Although these layered MHPs have shown great potential in optoelectronic devices with high stability, the development of appropriate organic spacers for tuning their band structures and boosting their optoelectronic properties remains a challenge. This originates from three important reasons. Firstly, insulating organic spacer cations create an energy barrier to induce quantum-well structures in the layered MHPs whose band gaps and optoelectronic properties are different from their 3D perovskites.27 Achieving their quantum-well band alignments depends on the full understanding of the quantum confinement and dielectric confinement effects. Secondly, organic spacer cations interact electrostatically with inorganic layers in the layered MHPs, which causes the structural distortions of the perovskite framework and the change of electronic structures.28 Thirdly, the toxicity of Pb in the layered perovskites can be resolved by the replacement of Pb with low-toxic or nontoxic cations, such as germanium (Ge),29 tin (Sn),30 copper (Cu),31 antimony (Sb),32 and bismuth (Bi).33 However, the optoelectronic properties of Pb-free layered MHPs are different from those of Pb-based ones. Previous studies have shown that the outstanding optoelectronic properties of Pb-based MHPs benefit from their high symmetry (Oh) and unique electronic structures, including the lone-pair Pb 6s orbital, inactive Pb 6p orbital, and strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC).34,35 Hence, the replacement of Pb with lone-pair cations is naturally considered as a feasible way. Owing to the weak SOC and s–p orbital hybridization, Ge-based perovskites possess relatively larger carrier effective masses, wider band gaps, and smaller absorption coefficients in the visible region.34 Bi-based and Sb-based perovskites usually are indirect band-gap semiconductors with relatively large band gaps, consequently resulting in weak optical absorption in the visible region and low PCE.36 Electronic structures of Sn-based MHPs are very similar to those of Pb-based ones. This is the reason why the replacement of Pb with Sn is regarded as one of the most promising methods to obtain Pb-free perovskites with superior optoelectronic properties.37 Considering the abundance and complexity of Pb-free layered MHPs, it requires enormous time and effort for only depending on the experimental methods and techniques to overcome the limitation of the above factors for finding appropriate candidate materials. In the past few years, high-throughput calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) have developed into a powerful and efficient tool to provide a highly accurate prediction of material properties with lower cost and higher efficiency.38,39 Moreover, DFT calculations have been applied to guide the experimental synthesis of MHPs and enabled identification of candidate materials for potential device applications.40,41 Therefore, it is strongly desired to search for highly stable layered Pb-free perovskites with outstanding optoelectronic properties based on DFT calculations.
In this work, we employ a hierarchical progressive screening method to find stable Pb-free layered MHPs based on DFT calculations. More than 60 3D inorganic perovskites with the general chemical formula of ABX3 have been investigated and they are firstly screened based on four feature factors: tolerance factor, formation energy, band gap, and carrier effective mass. Based on selective MHP bulks, two-dimensional (2D) Pb-free perovskites passivated with various different organic spacer cations are further screened by comparing their stabilities and electronic properties. Finally, we make a systematic comparison between R–P and D–J phase layered Pb-free MHPs, including their thermodynamic stabilities, electronic structures, and optical properties. After a sequence of screenings, D–J phase (CH2)8(NH3)2Csn−1SnnBr3n+1 compounds are predicted as a class of promising Pb-free layered perovskites with high stability, appropriate band gaps, small carrier effective masses, and high PCE.
2. Computational details
Computational models and stability evaluation
3D inorganic MHP models were created on the basis of cubic ABX3 structures from the Materials Project Database, where A represents group-IA alkali metal elements (A = Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs), B represents group IVA metal elements (B = Ge, Sn, and Pb), and X represents halogen elements (X = F, Cl, Br, and I). The optimized lattice constants of 60 inorganic MHPs are listed in Table S1.† 2D freestanding perovskite nanosheets were modeled by cleaving the optimized MHPs along the (001) direction and passivated with various hydrophobic organic cations,23 including [CH3(CH2)3NH3]+ (BA+), [CH3NH3]+ (MA+), [(NH2)3C]+ (GA+), [(CH3)2NH2]+ (DMA+), [C6H5CH2NH3]+ (PMA+), [C6H5(CH2)2NH3]+ (PEA+), and [(CH3CH2)NH3]+ (EA+). Considering different interlayer coupling, these layered MHPs were simulated using two types of configurations: R–P and D–J phases and they were created by vertically stacking 2D freestanding MHPs along the out-of-plane direction. In order to evaluate the structural stability of 3D MHPs, their formation energies (Ef) were calculated as follows, Ef = Etot − (EAX + EBX2)(1)where Etot is the total energy of a given ABX3 bulk, and EAX and EBX2 are the total energy of AX and BX2 precursors, respectively. Here AX and BX2 are used as precursors, which stems from the fact that they are widely applied to synthesize MHP materials.42–44 The surface passivation effect on the stability of 2D freestanding perovskites was evaluated by their adsorption energies (Eads), Eads = (Etot − Eslab − 2Eo)/2(2)where Eo is the total energy of an isolated organic ligand, and Etot and Eslab are the total energy of the 2D perovskite with and without adsorbed organic cations, respectively.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
All DFT calculations were performed by using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).45,46 The interactions between valence electrons and core electrons were treated by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.47 A kinetic cutoff energy of 450 eV was applied for the plane-wave expansion. The electronic exchange-correlation energy was treated by the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) version.48 The spin–orbit coupling (SOC) was also taken into account for examining the effect on the electronic structures of MHPs. However, the SOC effect leads to few changes in the band structures of Pb-free perovskites. The reduction of band gaps is smaller than 0.1 eV by the use of SOC (Fig. S1†), and thus it is insignificant and has been not considered in the calculations of 2D Pb-free MHPs. Owing to the well-known fact that the PBE functional underestimates the band gap of semiconductors, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06)49 was used to predict electronic and optical properties, and the AEXX parameter for the HSE06 calculations was set to 0.25. The interlayer interactions of 2D and layered MHP systems were described by using the PBE functional or HSE06 with Grimme's vdW correction (DFT-D3).50 The comparison among various vdW corrections (Table S2†) has confirmed that DFT-D3 is a reliable method to describe the interlayer coupling of vdW crystals.51,52 The k-point sampling in the Brillouin zone was implemented using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme with a grid of 12 × 12 × 12 for 3D MHP bulks. The 8 × 8 × 1 k-point mesh was used for 2D and layered MHP structures, and it can ensure sufficient computational accuracy based on the convergence test of energy and optical spectra (Fig. S2†). A vacuum layer of >20 Å along the z-direction was introduced to avoid spurious interactions between neighboring slabs in 2D systems. All these geometric structures were optimized until the energy and force acting on each atom were smaller than 10−4 eV and 10−2 eV Å−1, respectively.
Phonon dispersions were calculated using the Phonopy package53 within the harmonic approximation. The calculations were performed by using the supercell approach within the framework of the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT)54 and frozen cell method.55 The supercell for 2D BA2SnBr4 and BA2CsSn2Br7 is 2 × 2 × 1, and the corresponding atom number is 156 and 176, respectively. In order to avoid the imaginary frequency modes induced by incomplete structural optimizations, the convergence criterion of structural relaxation in these 2D structures was raised until the energy and force acting on each atom were smaller than 10−6 eV and 10−3 eV Å−1, respectively. Optical absorption spectra of MHP structures were calculated as follows,56 (3)where c represents the speed of light under vacuum conditions, and ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric function at a given frequency ω, respectively.

Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations
In order to evaluate thermodynamic stability of layered MHPs, we used R–P phase BA2CsSn2Br7 and D–J phase PRCsSn2Br7 as examples to explore their structural evolutions during the AIMD simulations. In the calculations, the expanded supercell models were used with the size of 11.57 × 11.55 × 45.92 Å3 and 11.66 × 11.64 × 21.68 Å3 for BA2CsSn2Br7 and PRCsSn2Br7, respectively. The corresponding atom number in the above two structures is 352 and 168, respectively. Because these layered MHP structures show few volume changes during the AIMD simulation under room-temperature conditions, the AIMD simulations were performed in the canonical (NVT) ensemble by using the algorithm of Nosé at 300 K. Furthermore, we used 2D BA2CsSn2Br7 and PR2CsSn2Br7 as examples to investigate the role of hydrophobic organic cations in the structural stability of Pb-free MHPs under humid conditions. For comparison, the moisture stability of the pristine CsSnBr3(001) thin film with three SnBr6-octahedron layers was also studied. The supercell size is 11.57 × 11.55 × 35 Å3, 11.66 × 11.64 × 45 Å3, and 11.84 × 11.84 × 30 Å3 for BA2CsSn2Br7, PR2CsSn2Br7, and CsSnBr3(001) thin films, respectively. For the AIMD simulations, a molecular layer with nine H2O molecules and nine O2 molecules was put on these perovskite surfaces. The initial distance between the molecular layer and perovskite surfaces was set to 3.5 Å. The running time of each AIMD calculation lasted more than 8 ps and the time step was 1 fs. Considering the time consuming nature of the AIMD simulations, the plane-wave cutoff was set to 300 eV and a 2 × 2 × 1 k-point mesh was used for the Brillouin zone integration.
3. Results and discussion
Feature parameters and screening of 3D inorganic MHPs
The workflow and computational framework of screening 3D inorganic MHP materials are illustrated in Fig. 1a. To find potential MHP candidates, here we apply four feature parameters as the selection criteria, namely the tolerance factor (t), formation energy (Ef), band gap (Eg), and carrier effective mass (m*). Here t is calculated by  (where RA, RB, and RX are the radius of A, B, and X ions, respectively),57 and m* is calculated by the equation of m* = ℏ2/(∂2E/∂2k) (where ℏ is the reduced Planck constant and k is the wave-vector magnitude in momentum space). The initial input structures contain 60 inorganic MHPs obtained by varying A, B, and X elements, and they are firstly optimized and screened by using the tolerance factor and formation energy as the evaluation criteria of stability. Ef and t values of ABX3 bulk structures are plotted in Fig. 1b. Generally, a stable perovskite structure has a negative Ef and appropriate t value. The empirical observations suggest that a stable ABX3 perovskite requires the tolerance factor to be in the range of 0.8 < t < 1.0.57,58 It can be seen that most of the Cs-based and Rb-based cubic perovskites have lower or negative Ef and reasonable t values, while the Li-based, Na-base, and K-based perovskites show either higher Ef or small t values (see Fig. 1b and Table S1†). The change of B-site cations from Ge, Sn to Pb leads to formation energies of ABX3 perovskites in the order of AGeX3 < ASnX3 < APbX3 and their tolerance factors in the order of AGeX3 > ASnX3 > APbX3. Considering the Pb toxicity, only the Cs-based and Rb-based Pb-free perovskites were selected for the subsequent evaluation of electronic properties. Nevertheless, not all of the Cs-based and Rb-based perovskites have negative Ef, and thus these perovskite structures with positive Ef are excluded in the subsequent study.

The band gap and carrier effective mass are used to evaluate the electronic properties of ABX3 perovskite bulks (Fig. 1c and d). The band gaps (Eg) and carrier effective masses (m*) of prescreened Pb-free ABX3 perovskites are calculated using the HSE06 functional. Meanwhile, the Eg values of these perovskites obtained using the PBE functional are also shown for comparison. All these ABX3 perovskites are direct band-gap semiconductors with a band-gap range from 1.06 to 3.23 eV (Fig. 1c and S3†). Both the Eg and m* of the selected Pb-free perovskites decrease with the change of halogen X from F, Cl, Br, to I. The orbital hybridization between the halogen anions and B-site metal cations is responsible for the changes. Taking CsSnX3 as an example, the orbital hybridization between the Sn-4p, 4s states and halogen X-p states is the strongest in CsSnI3 and the weakest in CsSnF3 (Fig. S4†), respectively. The strong orbital hybridization leads to large band dispersion, consequently resulting in smaller Eg and m*. A similar phenomenon was also reported in previous literature.59,60 The PBE functional calculation shows a similar trend of Eg and m* with the variation of halogen X, but it underestimates the band-gap of Pb-free perovskites.61 The application of MHP materials in photovoltaic devices requires that they have smaller m* and proper Eg matching with the solar spectrum (1.0 eV < Eg < 2.0 eV). Therefore, the F-based perovskites are not very suitable due to their relatively larger m* and Eg. Although the calculated band gaps (∼1.7 eV) of Cl-based perovskites are smaller than 2 eV, they are also excluded based on two reasons: (i) the HSE06 functional underestimates the band gaps by ∼0.4 eV, and thus the experimental Eg of Cl-based MHPs is actually larger than 2.0 eV. (ii) The transition from 3D bulks to 2D structures will induce a further increase of their Eg values. Combined with the results of t and Ef, it is found that CsSnBr3 and CsSnI3 can be candidates for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications due to their optimal band gaps (1.08–1.36 eV), smaller carrier effective masses (0.2–0.3m0), and relatively high structural stability (Ef < 0 eV). However, considering the high reactive activity of I-based perovskites with moisture, only CsSnBr3 is selected as the candidate for the subsequent investigation of 2D systems. As shown in Fig. 1e, CsSnBr3 is a direct band-gap semiconductor with both the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) located at the R point. The partial density of states (PDOS) and charge-density isosurface (CDI) distributions show that its CBM is mainly contributed by Sn-5p and Br-4p states and its VBM is composed of Sn-5s and Br-4p states (Fig. 1e). Owing to the nonlocalized nature of s and p orbitals, the large band dispersion of CsSnBr3 contributes to obtaining high carrier mobility and strong optical absorption. The calculated band gap of CsSnBr3 is 1.36 eV from the HSE functional and 0.68 eV from the PBE functional, in agreement with previous theoretical reports62 but smaller than the experimental value (1.75 eV).63 Here it needs to be mentioned that the Sn-based MHPs are easily oxidized when they are exposed to air and moisture. Also, the degradation of MHPs can be triggered when they are simultaneously exposed to gaseous oxygen and light. The reduction of surface exposure is a key point to suppress the photodegradation of MHPs. Therefore, surface passivation of Sn-based MHPs with hydrophobic organic cations is regarded as an efficient way to improve their stability.

Geometrics and electronic properties of 2D A′2Csn−1SnnBr3n+1 nanosheets. 
Based on the selected CsSnBr3, its 2D structures are established by passivating with various hydrophobic organic cations, including BA+, DMA+, EA+, GA+, MA+, PMA+, and PEA+. These 2D structures have a general chemical formula of A′2Csn−1SnnBr3n+1, where A′ represents organic cations and n is the number of inorganic layers. The typical atomic structures of A′2Csn−1SnnBr3n+1 with n = 1 and n = 2 are shown in Fig. 2a and their optimized lattice parameters are listed in Table S3.† The optimized lattice constants indicate that they present orthogonal structures with a slight difference in-plane lattice constants. These organic cations are screened by comparing the adsorption stabilities and band gaps of the formed 2D structures (Fig. 2b and c). These 2D perovskites with BA+, PEA+, and EA+ cations show relatively larger adsorption energies (Eads) irrespective of the layer number of inorganic layers, suggesting that passivation with these organic cations induces relatively higher structural stability of 2D perovskites (Fig. 2b). The increase of the number of inorganic layers doesn't change the trend of adsorption energies (Fig. S5†). On the other hand, the formation of 2D perovskite structures may cause lattice instability due to the out-of-plane symmetry breaking. In order to examine the dynamical stability of these 2D Pb-free perovskites, the phonon dispersions of 2D BA2SnBr4 and BA2CsSn2Br7 were calculated (Fig. S6†). It can be seen that there are no imaginary frequency modes in the phonon spectra of the two structures, suggesting that these 2D Pb-free perovskite structures are dynamically stable.

(b) Adsorption energies of A′2Csn−1SnnBr3n+1 (n = 1, 2) nanosheets. (c) Band gaps of A′2Csn−1SnnBr3n+1 (n = 1, 2) nanosheets calculated with the HSE06 functional. Projected band structures and DOS of (d) BA2SnBr4 and (e) BA2CsSn2Br7. The blue and red curves in band structures and DOS denote the electronic states contributed by the inorganic and organic layers of the perovskite, respectively. The insets indicate the charge-density distribution of VBM and CBM states in 2D perovskites. 
As shown in Fig. 2c, the band gaps (Eg) of 2D perovskites are not very sensitive to the change of organic cations but present a strong dependence on the number of inorganic layers (n) due to the quantum confinement effect. The change of n from 1 to 2 leads to the decrease of band gaps from ∼2.3 to ∼1.8 eV. The small Eg difference among these 2D perovskites with the same layer thickness mainly arises from the structural distortions of the SnBr6 octahedron induced by passivation with different organic cations (Table S3†). Overall, BA2Csn−1SnnBr3n+1 nanosheets have relatively larger Eads and suitable Eg, and thus they are selected to construct R–P and D–J phase layered perovskites. It needs to be mentioned that the differences of Eads and Eg among considered 2D structures are not very large, and we cannot entirely exclude the possibility of obtaining Pb-free layered MHPs with high stability and superior optoelectronic properties through passivation with other organic cations. The projected band structures and density of states of BA2Csn−1SnnBr3n+1 (n = 1, 2) are shown in Fig. 2d and e. Both BA2SnBr4 and BA2CsSn2Br7 are direct band-gap semiconductors with band gaps of 2.36 eV and 1.77 eV, respectively. The predicted hole and electron effective masses are 0.27 and 0.65m0 for BA2SnBr4 and 0.19 and 0.25m0 for BA2CsSn2Br7, respectively. Moreover, the carrier effective masses of 2D nanosheets largely approach those of the CsSnBr3 bulk when the number of inorganic layers is beyond 2. The small carrier effective masses of BA2Csn−1SnnBr3n+1 nanosheets provide a good basis for obtaining excellent carrier transport in the layered perovskites. Furthermore, it can be seen that the band-edge electronic states of BA2SnBr4 and BA2CsSn2Br7 are almost entirely contributed by the inorganic layer. The CDI distributions show that the CBM of BA2SnBr4 and BA2CsSn2Br7 is mainly contributed by Sn-5p states with a small amount of Br-4p states and their VBM is from the contribution of Sn-5s and Br-4p states (see insets of Fig. 2d and e). The result can be used to understand why the band gaps of these 2D MHPs are not very sensitive to the change of organic cations.


Geometrics and optoelectronic properties of R–P and D–J phase layered perovskites. 
The layered structures of CsSnBr3 are formed by vertically stacking BA2Csn−1SnnBr3n+1 along the out-of-plane direction. According to the difference of interlayer interactions and organic spacer cations, the layered structures can be divided into two archetypes: R–P phase BA2Csn−1SnnBr3n+1 and D–J phase (CH2)8(NH3)2Csn−1SnnBr3n+1. The R–P phase structures are featured by monovalent BA cations with interlayer van der Waals (vdW) gaps, enforcing a staggered arrangement. The D–J phase structures are featured by divalent (CH2)8(NH3)2 (i.e., PR) cations that could bridge two adjacent inorganic layers without interlayer gaps. It needs to be mentioned that a divalent PR cation is formed by the combination of two monovalent BA cations. Fig. 3a displays representative atomic structures of R–P and D–J phase layered perovskites with a bilayer SnBr6 octahedron (n = 2). For facilitating our description, R–P and D–J phase layered perovskites with n-layer SnBr6 octahedrons are defined as R–P–n and D–J–n, respectively. All these layered MHPs have been fully relaxed and their optimized lattice parameters are listed in Table S4.† The optimized results show that the synergic effect of interlayer vdW and H-bonding interactions makes different distortions of SnBr6 octahedrons at adjacent inorganic layers in R–P phase perovskites, while D–J phase perovskites present the same octahedron distortions at each inorganic layer (Table S4†). In turn, the distortions of SnBr6 octahedrons have an important effect on the electronic properties of these layered perovskites, and the detailed results will be discussed later.

The insets show the snapshots of AIMD trajectories for R–P and D–J phase structures at the simulation time of 0, 4, and 8 ps. The detailed snapshots of AIMD trajectories for the two structures are shown in Fig. S7 and S8 in the ESI.† 
To determine the thermodynamic stability of the two types of layered structures, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are performed at 300 K for 8 ps by using R–P-2 and D–J-2 as an example. The total energies of the two phase structures as a function of simulation time are plotted in Fig. 3b and c. These layered structures have a large energy change (∼0.12 eV per atom) in the initial annealing process due to the large structural relaxation, and the energy oscillation becomes very small (∼0.01 eV per atom) when the simulation time is beyond 2 ps. The snapshots of AIMD trajectories indicate that both R–P-2 and D–J-2 can basically maintain their crystal phase without structural decomposition after 8 ps AIMD simulations (Fig. S7 and S8 in the ESI†), suggesting their higher thermodynamic stability. Nevertheless, R–P-2 undergoes relatively larger structural distortions and interlayer movements than D–J-2, and the bond lengths and bond angles of inorganic layers in R–P-2 obviously deviate from its initial structure after the AIMD simulations (Table S5†). The result agrees well with experimental observations where D–J phase perovskites exhibit better stability and structural rigidity than R–P phase ones.64 A large number of previous studies have shown that MHP materials exhibit weak stability under humid conditions.65,66 In order to examine the structural stability of R–P and D–J phase perovskites in a moisture environment, we performed the AIMD simulations of BA2CsSn2Br7 and PR2CsSn2Br7 nanosheets that are in full contact with water and oxygen molecules. For comparison, the structural stability of the CsSnBr3(001) thin film under a humid environment was also studied. The AIMD simulation results show that CsSnBr3(001) exhibits higher surface activity and it can react with O2 molecules to form Sn–O bonds (Fig. S9†). Meanwhile, the Sn–Br bonding interactions on the perovskite surface are greatly weakened. Hence, we can find that some of the Br ions are dissociated from the perovskite surface into the molecular layer after 3.5 ps, suggesting that the pristine CsSnBr3 surface is unstable and follows a layer-by-layer dissociation mechanism in the moisture environment. In contrast, the surface hydrophobic BA+ and PR+ cations can prevent water and oxygen molecules from directly reacting with the inorganic SnBr6 octahedrons of BA2CsSn2Br7 and PR2CsSn2Br7 nanosheets. Hence, they can maintain their crystal phase without structural dissociation after 8 ps (Fig. S10 and S11 in the ESI†), further confirming the high stability of these layered perovskites.
Electronic structures of R–P phase BA2Csn−1SnnBr3n+1 and D–J phase PRCsn−1SnnBr3n+1 (n = 1, 2) are shown in Fig. 4. The calculated band structures indicate that all these structures are direct band-gap semiconductors with different Eg due to the interlayer coupling and quantum size effects (Fig. 4a–d). The CDI distributions indicate that both the VBM and CBM of these structures are contributed by the electronic states of inorganic layers, resulting in the quantum-well band alignments. Unlike the D–J phase structures (D–J-1 and D–J-2), the band-edge states of R–P phase structures (R–P-1 and R–P-2) exhibit nonuniform distribution at different inorganic layers due to unbalanced SnBr6 octahedron distortions induced by weak interlayer interactions (Table S4†). The result implies that the carrier transport is anisotropic at adjacent inorganic layers of R–P phase perovskites, which may have an important impact on the optoelectronic performance of perovskite devices. A similar phenomenon of nonuniform charge distribution in R–P phase layered perovskites has also been reported in previous literature.67 The band gaps of these layered structures are plotted in Fig. 4e. Here the band gap of D–J-3 has been included for the understanding of the quantum size effect. However, it is hardly possible to calculate the band gaps of R–P-n (n ≥ 3) and D–J-n (n ≥ 4) using the HSE06 functional due to the large computation cost. Both the Eg values of R–P and D–J phase perovskites decrease with increasing number of inorganic layers due to the well-known quantum confinement effect. For instance, the Eg of D–J phase perovskites shows a reduction from 2.54 to 1.58 eV with the change of n from 1 to 3. Therefore, appropriately increasing the thickness of the inorganic layer will make better matching of D–J phase perovskites with the solar spectrum, which is essential for the improvement of PCE. For a given number of inorganic layers, it can be identified that the band gap of D–J phase structures largely approaches that of R–P phase ones due to the fact that the band-edge electronic states of the layered perovskites are mainly contributed by their inorganic layers. However, D–J phase structures exhibit larger band dispersions at the vicinity of the Fermi level than R–P phase ones, which can be confirmed by their carrier effective masses. As shown in Fig. 4f, carrier effective masses (m*) of D–J phase structures are correspondingly smaller than those of R–P phase ones, especially for electron effective masses . For instance,  of R–P-1 and R–P-2 is 1.33 and 1.03m0, respectively, while  of D–J-1 and D–J-2 is 0.28 and 0.26m0, respectively. The result implies that transport properties of D–J phase PRCsn−1SnnBr3n+1 are superior to those of R–P phase BA2Csn−1SnnBr3n+1. In addition, the increase of layer number n can also induce a slight reduction of carrier effective masses in both R–P and D–J phase layered perovskites, which indicates that an appropriate thickness of the inorganic layer in these layered perovskites is crucial for enhancing their transport properties.

Finally, we turn to investigate the role of phase structure in the optoelectronic properties of these layered perovskites (R–P-n and D–J-n) and their optical absorption is firstly studied using eqn (3). Fig. 5a and b show the optical absorption spectra of R–P and D–J phase layered perovskites along the in-plane and out-of-plane polarization direction, respectively. Here the absorption spectrum of the CsSnBr3 bulk is also calculated for comparison. It can be seen that the absorption of all these layered structures exhibits strong anisotropy along two polarization directions. Overall, α⊥ indicates an obvious blue shift as compared to α‖, which makes the materials have relatively weak visible-light absorption along the out-of-plane direction. Therefore, the surface plane of these layered perovskites parallel to the oscillation direction of the electric field contributes to the enhancement of their optical absorption, which is crucial for applying them as light absorbers in solar cells, photodetectors, and photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, D–J phase structures exhibit higher absorption coefficients than the R–P phase ones in the visible and ultraviolet regions. It can be found that the α‖ of D–J-3 approaches that of the CsSnBr3 bulk, and its absorption coefficient reaches 105 cm−1 when the photon energy is beyond 2.15 eV. The large absorption coefficients of D–J phase structures benefit from the large dispersion of band-edge states that are dominated by Sn-5s, Sn-5p, and Br-4p orbitals.

The range of dashed lines corresponds to the visible-light region with the wavelength range from 390 to 780 nm. (c) Schematic illustration of light irradiation on the layered perovskites along the in-plane (ω‖) and out-of-plane (ω⊥) direction. (d) PCE (η) of the 3D CsSnBr3 bulk and the layered structures as a function of band gaps. The numbers 0.1–1.0 denote different absorption factors. The dashed lines denote theoretical PCE values obtained by varying absorption factors (a) and band gaps (Eg). η‖ and η⊥ denote the PCE of the layered perovskites obtained by using the ω‖ and ω⊥ incident light, respectively. 
Owing to the appropriate band gaps and high optical absorption coefficients in the visible-ultraviolet region, it is expected that high PCE values in D–J phase layered perovskites could be obtained. In previous studies, the PCE model proposed by Scharber et al.68 was widely used to predict the PCE of low-dimensional semiconductor materials. However, this model ignores the role of the optical absorption coefficient and material thickness of absorbers, resulting in the overestimation of PCE values (see Section S12 in the ESI† for details). In order to provide a reasonable prediction of maximum PCE (η) of the layered perovskites, we develop an improved model as follows, (4)where FF is the fill factor and set to 0.65 that corresponds to the upper limit of FF in the layered perovskites and it is taken from the optimum value of CsSnBr3 devices reported in previous literature.69Eloss is loss-in-potential that denotes the energy difference between the electron quasi Fermi level and hole quasi Fermi level, and it is set to 0.3 eV that corresponds to the Shockley–Queisser limit.70–72S(E) is the AM1.5 solar energy flux (stated in W m−2 eV−1) at the photon energy E, and Eg is the band gap of perovskites. a(E) is the photon absorption factor and it can be expressed as a(E) = 1 − e−2α(E)L, where α(E) is the calculated absorption coefficient and L is the thickness of materials. Our calculated results indicate that the PCE values of R–P and D–J phase layered perovskites increase with the increase of L, and their PCE values change insignificantly when L is beyond 500 nm (Fig. S12†). Therefore, L is set to 500 nm that ensures the saturable absorption of the perovskites for obtaining maximum PCE.73 More importantly, this model provides more accurate prediction than other PCE models (see Section S12 in the ESI† for details). In addition, it needs to be noted that these layered perovskite materials usually have larger exciton binding energies that restrict the photon-to-electron conversion, resulting in lower PCE values of these materials.74 Moreover, the quantum-well band alignments in the layered MHPs inhibit the carrier transport along the out-of-plane direction and significantly limit the photocurrent collection. Hence, the exploration of efficient methods to reduce exciton binding energies and enhance photocurrent collection in the layered MHPs is also crucial for their PCE promotion.
Based on eqn (4), the maximum PCE η of these layered perovskites is calculated by considering light irradiation along the in-plane (ω‖) and out-of-plane (ω⊥) directions (Fig. 5c), respectively. The computed PCE values (η‖ and η⊥) of these layered perovskites as a function of the band gap are plotted in Fig. 5d. Several important trends can be clearly identified: (i) η‖ is significantly larger than their η⊥ due to the more efficient optical absorption along the in-plane direction of the layered perovskites, which implies that the in-plane light irradiation contributes to high PCE. (ii) The computed PCE of D–J phase perovskites is correspondingly larger than that of R–P phase ones. For example, η‖ and η⊥ are 18.32% and 12.95% for D–J-2 and 16.02% and 11.27% for R–P-2, respectively. (iii) The increase of inorganic-layer thickness can lead to a rapid promotion of PCE in these layered perovskites. For example, the η‖ of D–J phase structures (D–J-n) increases from 9.28% to 20.89% with the change of thickness from n = 1 to n = 3. Especially for D–J-3, its η‖ (20.89%) higher than that of the CsSnBr3 bulk (19.03%). The above results suggest the huge potential of D–J phase PRCsn−1SnnBr3n+1 for photovoltaic devices. By engineering the thickness of the inorganic layer, the PCE of D–J phase perovskite devices can compete with that of existing photovoltaic devices based on other semiconductor materials, such as CdTe, CIGS, and Pb-based perovskites.75–77

4. Conclusions
In summary, we used a hierarchical computational screening method to find highly stable layered Pb-free perovskites based on DFT calculations and AIMD simulations. This method leads to a sequential screening of MHP materials from their bulks, nanosheets, to layered structures. Our calculated results demonstrate that D–J phase PRCsn−1SnnBr3n+1 compounds were selected as a promising class of layered Pb-free perovskites for optoelectronic applications because of their high stability, appropriate band gaps, and smaller carrier effective masses. Furthermore, we developed an improved model to predict the PCE of the layered perovskites. Owing to the strong optical absorption in visible and ultraviolet regions (>105 cm−1), the maximum PCE of D–J phase layered structures is larger than 20% when the thickness of the inorganic layer in the perovskites is beyond that of a bilayer. This work provides a route to find highly stable Pb-free layered MHPs with excellent optoelectronic properties.
