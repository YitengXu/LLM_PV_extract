    , Accepted 21st June 2019First published on 24th June 2019AbstractFor the purpose of developing Cs2TeI6 based X-ray detectors and imaging devices, Cs2TeI6 thick films were prepared using the electrospray method under ambient conditions. The effects of spraying parameters on the morphology of the films were investigated. During the electrospray process, we observed that Cs2TeI6 microdroplets changed to a steady cone jet and then to an unstable multi-jet model as the electrical bias increased from 6 kV to 12 kV, resulting in variable film morphologies. Five representative solvent systems with different evaporation rates and contact angles on the FTO/double-TiO2 substrates were studied. We find a strong correlation of the contact angle with the speed of primary nucleation, growth mode and subsequent film morphology. Moreover, the crystalline quality has been improved with the rise of substrate temperature. Finally, a dense and uniform Cs2TeI6 film was obtained with an electrical bias of 10 kV using dimethyl formamide (DMF) as the solvent at a substrate temperature of 160 °C. The resulting Cs2TeI6 films have resistivity on the order of 1010 Ω cm, which indicates potential applications in X-ray detection and imaging. The films show a strong photoresponse to visible light based on the Cs2TeI6 thick film devices, and an on–off ratio of 22 under 425 nm light (∼65 mW cm−2). The sensitivity of the assembled Cs2TeI6 perovskite-based detectors can be 2.4 nC R−1 cm−2 under illumination of 60 kVp X-rays.
1. Introduction
Recently, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have attracted great attention due to their tremendous photon collection efficiency in photovoltaic devices.1–5 Their excellent optoelectronic properties, such as high charge carrier mobility,6,7 long carrier diffusion length,8,9 low exciton binding energy,10 and high light absorption,11 make them promising candidates for optical and X-ray detectors. Perovskite materials are compatible with low-temperature and low-cost solution processing.12–15 For instance, X-ray sensitivity and responsivity values of 25 μC mGyair−1 cm−3 and 1.9 × 104 carriers per photon, respectively, for solution-processed CH3NH3PbI3 films can be reached.16 These solution processed perovskite materials can greatly make up the shortfall of traditional inorganic semiconductors under illumination of X-ray, such as amorphous Se,17,18 crystalline Si19 and CdTe.17,19 It is worth mentioning that only a few of these materials can be deposited uniformly onto the thin-film-transistor (TFT) arrays below the deterioration temperatures of the arrays, which are needed for readout of electronic signals in array detectors.20–22 Apart from that, both simulations23 and experiments24,25 indicate that hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites are unstable under humid conditions. Graetzel et al.26 discovered that the device should be constructed in an atmospheric environment with a relative humidity less than 1%. Therefore, finding new stable perovskite materials is important for high-performance X/γ-detectors.
All-inorganic lead-free halide perovskite Cs2TeI627 is more stable in moisture and air compared with hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites.28,29 The structure of Cs2TeI6 can be thought to derive from ordered double perovskites as A2B′B′′X6, where A is Cs or MA(CH3NH3), B′ and B′′ are octahedral metals and X is a halogen atom.30 Putting a vacancy in place of the B′-site forms vacancy-ordered double perovskites, A2BX6, featuring discrete [BX6] octahedra. The octahedra in the Cs2TeI6 crystal structure are not connected but they interact via weak I⋯I van der Waals bonding. Cs2TeI6 adopts a cubic structure and shows isotropic properties and exhibits no phase transitions above room temperature.
The X-ray absorption rate is determined by the atomic number Z as Z4/AE3, where A is atomic mass and E is the X-ray photon energy. The average atomic number of Cs2TeI6 is 53.3 (for commercially used X-ray detection materials such as Cd0.9Zn0.1Te and amorphous Se, it is 49.1 and 34, respectively), leading to a better stopping power and highly improved detection efficiency. The electrospray process has been extensively used in film preparation,14,31–36 owing to its simple operation and cheap equipment without high vacuum. Moreover, this method can be used cooperatively with a mobile working platform, which is meaningful when setting up a production line. The key point of film preparation in such a line is the control of spray parameters and film morphologies.37–41 Hong et al.42 studied the control of precursor droplets by adjusting the applied electrical field and developed a continuous fabrication of large grain-sized perovskite films using the electrospray technique. Bi et al.43 investigated the influence of substrate temperature in spray processing and fabricated a perovskite solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 13.54%.
Previously,44 we obtained a Cs2TeI6 thick film device using the electrospray method with a sensitivity of 192 nC R−1 cm−2 under 40 kVp X-rays. In this work, the morphologies of Cs2TeI6 films are investigated in detail by tailoring the electrospray parameters such as electric field, solvent and substrate temperature. The aim of this work was to obtain uniform and compact Cs2TeI6 thick films for X-ray detectors. We achieved a resistivity of 5.06 × 1010 Ω cm in photoresponsive Cs2TeI6 films prepared by the electrospray technique and an on–off ratio of ∼22 under 425 nm optical light (∼65 mW cm−2). The sensitivity of the assembled Cs2TeI6 detectors was 2.4 nC R−1 cm−2 when exposed to 60 kVp X-rays.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Material synthesis
All solutions (analytically pure) were purchased from Kermel and used as received. CsI (99.999%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. TeI4 (99.99%) was prepared by a solid reaction in a vertical Bridgman furnace using elemental Te (99.999%) and I2 (99.999%). PTAA was purchased from p-OLED Photoelectric Technology Corp. TiO2 Paste (18 NR-T) was purchased from Dyesol Corp.
2.2 Perovskite thick-film fabrication
Perovskite thick-films were formed on two-layered TiO2-coated (compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) and mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2)) fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-glass substrates. The FTO-glass substrates (6 Ω sq−1) were cleaned in turn by ultrasonication in soap, deionized water, ethanol, acetone and then dried under a stream of nitrogen. The c-TiO2 layer was deposited by spin-coating (2000 rpm, 60 s) of the precursor solution, titanium isopropoxide (95%, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in isopropyl alcohol (10% v/v), then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. The m-TiO2 layer was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 25 s with the precursor sol–gel, 18 nm TiO2 nanoparticle paste diluted with ethanol (2:7 v/v), then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. All perovskite precursor solutions were formed by mixing CsI with TeI4 at a 2:1.1 molar ratio (TeI4 is partly lost by evaporation during the heating process) for a total concentration of 10 mg mL−1, then stirred in a 60 °C water bath for 30 min. Then, they were deposited on the glass/FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 substrates under ambient conditions by electrospraying. The electrospray setup consists of a syringe and needle (internal diameter 0.16 mm), a syringe pump (LSP01-1a), a high positive bias power supply (Dong-Wen Technical Corp.) and a heating platform covered with aluminum foil as the plate ground electrode. The substrate was then placed onto the aluminum foil. During the electrospray deposition, a syringe attached to a pump was filled with the as-prepared Cs2TeI6 solution. The flow rate was set at 1 mL h−1. The electrospray started by applying a high positive bias of ∼6–12 kV at the electrode (nozzle head). The distance between the nozzle head and the substrate was 5 cm. The deposition time was 180 min, and the substrate was heated using a hotplate at ∼145–165 °C.
For selection of the electric field, the films were deposited under different electrical biases of 6 kV, 8 kV, 10 kV and 12 kV. The solvent was DMF and the heating temperature was 160 °C. The other parameters were the same as mentioned above. To find suitable precursor solutions, five different solutions, dimethylformamide (DMF) and n-butyl alcohol (NBA) (1:1 volume/volume), DMF and isopropanol (IPA) (1:1 v/v), DMF and ethanol (EA) (1:1 v/v), DMF and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (1:1 v/v), and DMF, were used respectively, the electrical bias was fixed at 10 kV and the temperature was fixed at 150 °C. Other parameters were the same as before. For optimizing the growth temperature, the substrate temperature was set at 145 °C, 150 °C, 155 °C, 160 °C, and 165 °C, separately. The solvent was DMF and the electrical bias was 10 kV. Other parameters remained the same as above. The films thicknesses were ∼2–6 μm measured by SEM of vertical-view images.
After optimizing the electrospray parameters, we used a DMF atmospheric annealing procedure. This was performed using a 10 mL beaker filled with DMF, a glass cover with a diameter of 15 cm and a heating stage. The annealing temperature was set at 160 °C for 5 h. The sample was put on one side of the glass cover and the beaker on the other. The distance between the sample and the beaker was about 5 cm. Only one sample was placed on the glass cover during each annealing process and the DMF vapor filled the space when the platform was heated to 160 °C.
2.3 Device fabrication
The device architecture used is FTO/compact-TiO2/mesoporous-TiO2/perovskite (Cs2TeI6)/poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA)/Au, as shown in Fig. 1(a)(VI). The role of the c-TiO2 layer is to transmit electrons. The m-TiO2 layer plays the role of an intermediate layer between c-TiO2 and Cs2TeI6, to improve interface bonding. Cs2TeI6 is the effective layer of the device. The layer of PTAA can smoothen the Cs2TeI6 film surface, in order to obtain a flat layer of the Au electrode and uniform electric field. Material synthesis, detector fabrication, performance testing, and characterization were all performed under ambient humidity (30–60% relative humidity).

(b) A photo of a Cs2TeI6 film prepared by electrospraying and an assembled device using carbon paste, copper conductor and conductive silver paste. 
TiO2-Coated FTO-glass substrates and perovskite thick-films were prepared as stated above. Then, the samples were transferred to a spin coater to deposit PTAA (15 mg mL−1, chlorobenzene) at 2000 rpm for 60 s, and then heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Finally, Au electrodes (2 mm × 2 mm) were deposited by a thermal evaporation system under a vacuum of 1 × 10−4 Pa. The entire process is shown in Fig. 1(a). Fig. 1(b) shows the Cs2TeI6 film sample prepared by electrospraying and the assembled device.
2.4 Material characterization
The crystallinity and structure of the films were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (Shimadzu). SEM images of the perovskite thick-films were obtained on a FESEM (FEI Nano SEM 450). UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu 3150 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer in the range of 400–1600 nm. I–V curves were measured using a Keithley 6517B electrometer. I–t curves were measured using a 425 nm light emitting diode and a Keithley 6517B electrometer.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Effect of the electric field

Fig. 2 shows a schematic diagram for the formation of a thick perovskite film on the glass/FTO/compact-TiO2/mesoporous-TiO2 substrate. The whole electrospray process can be divided into four related primary sub-processes, i.e. (I) injecting from the capillary, (II) falling down from the capillary, (III) wetting the substrate, and (IV) spreading on the substrate. The main influence factor in I and II is the electric field, which controls the solution dispersion level and the droplet size. At the second stage, the droplets go through Coulomb splitting and move towards the substrate under the action of an electric field force. The subprocesses, III and IV, are mainly controlled by the solvents and the substrate temperatures, which affect the wetting condition and the evaporation of the droplets. After the droplets touch the substrate, the solvents evaporate by heating, and a dense thick film forms.
 Fig. 2  Schematic illustration of the electrospray process and the formation of the thick perovskite film on the glass/FTO/compact-TiO2/mesoporous-TiO2 substrate. 
The top-view SEM images of the films deposited under different electrical bias are shown in Fig. 3(a)–(d). In Fig. 3(a), a 6 kV electrical bias was applied. The electrostatic force overcame the surface tension, and then the droplet from the tip split into tiny droplets resulting in films with an inner-island shaped structure. As shown in Fig. 3(b), as the electrical bias increased to 8 kV, these tiny droplets went through further Coulombic explosions and dispersed into a cloud of small droplets. Under this condition, the gaps between the inner-island were mostly filled, but a few pinholes existed. In Fig. 3(c), at a 10 kV electrical bias, a single stable cone-jet was formed and a dense and uniform film was obtained. However, when the electrical bias continued to increase to 12 kV, the cone jet became unstable and formed divergent multiple jets, thus the quality of the film deteriorated, as can be seen in Fig. 3(d). The whole process of jet evolution is shown schematically in Fig. 3(e). As the electrical field increases, the droplets gradually experience a pattern change from drops to microdroplets, steady cone-jet and multi-jet model, etc. We find that for DMF, the spray electrical bias of 10 kV favors the formation of a cone-jet motif, matched with the 5 cm spray distance (from syringe needle to substrate) and other parameters (solution concentration, injection flow rate, etc.).

3.2 Optimization of the solvent system
In order to find a solvent system with good wettability on the substrate, five solvent systems were adopted to prepare Cs2TeI6 solutions for the electrospray experiments. Table 1 shows the solvent ingredients.

Fig. 4(a)–(e) show the images of these five different solution droplets on the glass/FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 substrates at room temperature (25 °C). The contact angles are in the range of 3.9°–6.2° when lower surface tension alcohols (surface tension: ∼22–25 mN m−1) are added to pure DMF (surface tension: 37.1 mN m−1), see Fig. 4(a)–(c). The contact angle of a 1:1 mixture of DMF/DMSO (surface tension: 43.5 mN m−1) is ∼27.1° (Fig. 4(d)). When using pure DMF, the contact angle decreases to 11.6° (Fig. 4(e)). Therefore, the contact angles of the solutions could be decreased by adding solvents with a low surface tension, and increased by addition of high surface tension solvents. Normally, a low contact angle indicates good wettability and high possibility of obtaining uniform films. Fig. 4(f)–(h) show sketch maps of the evaporation and film deposition process for the solutions with different boiling points and contact angles. Fig. 4(f) shows that low boiling point alcohols (boiling point: NBA 118 °C, IPA 82 °C, EA 78 °C) in DMF (boiling point: 152 °C) rapidly evaporate during heating (150 °C). This forms an empty air region above the substrate and dry powders cluster above this air area, which finally deposit on the substrate with many pinholes in the film. Fig. 4(g) shows the deposition process of the mixed solvent (DMF:DMSO = 1:1 v/v) system. The boiling point of DMSO of 189 °C is much higher than that of DMF. Therefore, incompletely volatilized DMSO could cause pinholes to form. For this reason, in a two-solvent system, the discrepancy between boiling points of two components should not be too high. In Fig. 4(h), pure DMF evaporates at a fixed rate during the heating process (150 °C), forming a dense and uniform film.

Fig. 5(a)–(c) show the film morphologies obtained using three different alcohols (NBA, IPA, EA) mixed with DMF (1:1 v/v) as solvents, respectively. The particle clustering phenomenon in the thick films (∼2 μm) gradually weakens and the degree of coverage increases as the boiling point of the alcohol decreases. Fig. 5(d) shows the film from DMF supplemented with high boiling point DMSO (1:1 v/v). The surface of these films is smoother than films deposited from solvent systems with added alcohols, but the pinholes still exist. As shown in Fig. 5(e), a smooth and almost pinhole-free film can be obtained from pure DMF. Fig. 5(f)–(j) show the cross-sectional SEM images corresponding to Fig. 5(a)–(e). Dendritic growth occurs when large cluster particles are present in the film. The clusters form mainly because of the very fast volatilization of the solvent thus dewetting the substrate surface. To avoid the clusters, the boiling points and the evaporation rates of the solvents have to be controlled.

In short, the contact angle reflects the wettability of the solution and is crucial for obtaining a thick film with a smooth surface. Meanwhile, the boiling point of the solvent is also an important factor. Under this experimental condition, DMF is much more appropriate because the wettability and the evaporation rate can appropriately match.
3.3 Effect of substrate temperature
The substrate temperature affects the volatilization of the solution, changing the supersaturation, thus affecting the nucleation rate at the initial stage of film growth. Furthermore, the temperature field provides a driving force for grain growth, influencing the grain size and the crystalline quality. Fig. 6 shows a group of SEM images of the Cs2TeI6 films deposited by the electrospray technique performed at different substrate temperatures using DMF as the solvent. As the substrate temperature increased from 145 °C to 165 °C, the grain size gradually increased and the crystallization quality also improved, see Fig. 6(a)–(e). Meanwhile, the grain boundaries became clearer as the crystalline quality increased.
 Fig. 6  (a–e) Top-view SEM images of Cs2TeI6 films deposited by electrospraying performed at V = 10 kV and Q = 1 mL h−1 with DMF solvent, at different temperatures, from 145 °C to 170 °C. The white spots in the SEM images are the initial crystal nucleus. (f–j) Cross-sectional SEM images corresponding to (a–e). 
The cross-sectional images of the resulting Cs2TeI6 films are shown in Fig. 6(f)–(j). According to the composition, three layers are observed, the FTO substrate, the TiO2 interlayer and the Cs2TeI6 perovskite film. With the substrate temperature increasing from 145 °C to 160 °C, the thickness of the Cs2TeI6 film also increases owing to the three-dimensional growth of the grains. However, if the substrate temperature continues to increase up to 165 °C, the thickness decreases slightly, which can be attributed to evaporation of the solute at higher temperature. In addition, an overly high growth temperature, i.e. a superfast evaporation rate, can promote the formation of internal pores in the film, as shown in Fig. 6(j). In this work, the optimum growth temperature is close to 160 °C, considering the grain size, the crystalline quality and the film thickness.
To further optimize the film quality, we used DMF atmosphere annealing. The aim of annealing is to eliminate the initial crystal nucleus, i.e. the spots on the surface of the Cs2TeI6 film. The morphology of Cs2TeI6 film without annealing is shown in Fig. 7(a) and that with annealing in a DMF atmosphere at 160 °C for 5 h is shown in Fig. 7(b). DMF was chosen as the annealing atmosphere as it was also used as the solvent for electrospraying and we found that it can improve the recrystallization of the film. As shown in Fig. 7(b), DMF atmosphere annealing was effective in eliminating the tiny spots. The simple annealing setup is shown in Fig. 7(c).

3.4 Characterization of the Cs2TeI6 thick film
The phase purity of the Cs2TeI6 films was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 8(a) shows XRD patterns of the as-deposited films prepared at 10 kV under 160 °C with DMF precursor solution on a glass/FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 substrate. The Bragg peaks at 26.5°, 30.7°, 43.9°, 51.9° and 54.4° are assigned to the (222), (400), (440), (622) and (444) crystallographic planes, respectively, of the cubic crystal structure of Cs2TeI6. The optical transmission spectra of the Cs2TeI6 perovskite film are shown in Fig. 8(b). The inset shows the obtained bandgap energy, which is close to the value of DFT calculations of Cs2TeI6 (1.83 eV), which also suggests that the bandgap is indirect.27 The indirect bandgap was estimated to be ∼1.88 eV by fitting the Tauc plot, as shown in the inset of Fig. 8(b).

(b) The UV-Vis-NIR transmission spectrum of the Cs2TeI6 film, the inset shows the bandgap fitted by a Tauc plot. (c) Room-temperature I–V curve of a Cs2TeI6 device in the dark. (d) Current–time (I–t) curve of the Cs2TeI6 detector at 0.1 V illuminated with a 425 nm light emitting diode. (e) Time response of the Cs2TeI6 film under an X-ray beam with a bias of 60 kVp, and current in the range of 0.1–0.6 mA. (f) X-ray photocurrent as a function of exposure rate. 
The dark I–V curve of the Cs2TeI6 device with FTO and Au electrodes measured at room-temperature is shown in Fig. 8(c). It exhibits good linearity under a bias from −0.1 to 0.1 V and the resistivity of the whole device is approximately 5.06 × 1010 Ω cm. The I–V curve does not pass through the origin point because of the built-in electric field. This built-in field is caused by the asymmetric electrode structure. Fig. 8(d) shows the I–t curve measured at a bias of 0.1 V (∼15 V mm−1) under the illumination of a 425 nm light emitting diode (∼65 mW cm−2). The devices have an on–off ratio of ∼22, with great responsivity to optical light. As shown in Fig. 8(e), the time-dependent response of the Cs2TeI6 device to 60 kVp X-rays was recorded by changing the X-ray flux under a fixed applied bias of 0.3 V. Different X-ray tube currents correspond to different X-ray dose rates. In this work, the X-ray tube currents were varied from 0.6 mA to 0.1 mA. The device produces a series of photocurrents under different dose rates. Here, the photo-current is in the scale of pA. When the X-ray tube current was set to 0 mA, the current decreased gradually. The gradual (rather than abrupt) decay is caused by traps in the Cs2TeI6 layer presumably because the electron cannot recombine directly with the hole after falling into traps. It has to be excited out of the trap before it can recombine with the hole. This is an unstable process that takes some relaxation time, so in the dark, the current does not immediately reduce to zero but decays slowly.
The device X-ray sensitivity is defined as S = (ION − IOFF)/exposure rate. Fig. 8(f) shows the linear response as a function of exposure rate in the range of 0.33–1.98 R min−1 from which a sensitivity of 2.4 nC R−1 cm−2 at 60 kVp can be estimated.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a set of optimized electrospray parameters, i.e. electric field, solvent and substrate temperature, were investigated in air for the deposition of Cs2TeI6 films. The electric field during electrospraying affects the dispersion size and the stability of the droplets. A stable cone-jet can be formed under a 10 kV electrical bias, which can help in obtaining a dense and pinhole-free film. Additionally, we find that the contact angles of substrates and evaporation rates of solvents are crucial for the morphology of Cs2TeI6 films. A high surface coverage and dense films were obtained using DMF as the solvent with a contact angle of ∼11.6° on a glass/FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 substrate. Finally, a Cs2TeI6 thick film was successfully prepared by the electrospray method at an optimized substrate temperature of 160 °C in air. The resistivity of the resulting Cs2TeI6 perovskite-based detectors prepared by the electrospray method can reach up to 5.06 × 1010 Ω cm with an on–off ratio of ∼22 when exposed to 425 nm optical light (∼65 mW cm−2). The sensitivity of the Cs2TeI6 detectors under 60 kVp X-rays can be 2.4 nC R−1 cm−2 with an exposure rate range of 0.33–1.98 R min−1.
