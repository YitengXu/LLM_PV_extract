    , Accepted 21st June 2012First published on 25th June 2012AbstractSemiconductor-sensitized TiO2 solar cells employing CdSe as a light absorber demonstrate superior photovoltaic performance to the best-performing cascaded CdS/CdSe cells with practically identical optical density in the study. A careful comparison between CdSe and CdS/CdSe sensitized cells reveals that while CdS can greatly promote the subsequent growth of CdSe in the cascade electrodes and hence light harvesting, the presence of a CdS buffer layer impedes the injection of electrons from CdSe to TiO2 and accelerates charge recombination at the TiO2/sensitizer interface. As a result, better performance was achieved with CdSe-sensitized solar cells when light absorption is identical to that of CdS/CdSe cells, making the CdS buffer layer redundant. CdSe-sensitized TiO2 solar cells incorporating light scattering layers and an aqueous polysulfide electrolyte yielded an unprecedented power conversion efficiency of up to 5.21% under simulated AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 illumination.
Introduction
Semiconductor nanocrystals have been attracting considerable attention due to their band gap tunability and inherently high extinction coefficients, making them very promising candidates for efficient light harvesting materials in solar cells.2–6 Good progress has been made in improving the power conversion efficiency of semiconductor-sensitized solar cells (SSCs) in the past few years by optimizing the components constituting the device, such as the microstructure of the photoanode, the configuration of semiconductor sensitizers on the metal oxide, and the counter electrode, etc.7–13 Utilization of light from the visible to the near infrared region in the solar spectrum and favorable band alignment for efficient charge separation remain the key requirements for the further improvement of device performance.
Among various semiconductor sensitizers, II–VI compound semiconductors CdS14–16 and CdSe17–20 are the most widely used to sensitize nanocrystalline TiO2, either alone or together.7,8,10,11,21–27 The loading of CdS or CdSe onto a mesoscopic photoanode can be achieved by various wet chemistry methods, such as chemical bath deposition, successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), or chemical adsorption of the as-synthesized nanocrystals of CdS or CdSe with the help of linker molecules.
Of these methods, SILAR offers easy fabrication as well as the most efficient SSCs to date. Under optimum conditions, a power conversion efficiency of 4.92% has been attained under AM 1.5 100 mW cm−2 illumination when cascaded CdS/CdSe-sensitized TiO2 was used along with a polysulfide electrolyte.8 The superior performance of the CdS/CdSe cascade was attributed to the presence of CdS underneath CdSe serving as a buffer layer, which on one hand was believed to facilitate the charge separation as a result of the favorable staircase band alignment at the CdS/CdSe interface (type II heterojunction),28,29 and on the other hand promotes the subsequent deposition of CdSe and consequently enhances light harvesting at long wavelengths.21
However, in a recent study Bisquert and co-workers demonstrated that CdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrodes perform better in devices than do CdS/CdSe-sensitized electrodes when more CdSe was deposited on TiO2.10 This observation raises an important question: is the superior performance of CdS/CdSe-sensitized TiO2 observed previously a result of facilitated charge separation or simply because of enhanced light harvesting? Unfortunately, the CdSe electrode in the aforementioned study had a much higher optical density (OD) than that of the CdS/CdSe electrode, making the comparison difficult. Therefore, in this study CdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrodes of nearly identical OD to the best-performing CdS/CdSe electrodes were fabricated and their photovoltaic properties were scrutinized. The latter was examined by varying the thickness of CdS and CdSe layers, and 5CdS/5CdSe (5 is the number of deposition cycles) was found to be the best cascade-structured sensitizer under the present SILAR deposition conditions, which was then used as a reference to the CdSe cells (Table S1, ESI†). It is interesting that CdSe-sensitized TiO2 exhibits better performance than the CdS/CdSe in the study. Careful optical studies reveal that the presence of CdS significantly promotes the growth of CdSe, which then greatly improves light harvesting of the electrode. However, when sufficient CdSe is deposited on TiO2 by its own, better performance was observed due to the enhanced photo-conversion of long wavelength photons and eliminated recombination at the TiO2/sensitizer interface.
Experimental section
Preparation of mesoscopic TiO2 electrodes
Titanium(IV) oxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (Degussa, P25) mixed with a small amount of ethanol were ground by a pestle and mortar to break up agglomerates. Ethyl cellulose and α-terpineol were then mixed with the ground TiO2 powder following a previously reported procedure for making TiO2 paste.30 Fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass (FTO, Pilkington TEC-15) was cleaned by sequential sonication in 5% Decon 90 solution, deionized water and absolute ethanol. TiO2 electrodes were prepared by screen-printing the above paste onto cleaned FTO glass several times in order to get an appropriate thickness. The printed films were then sintered in air by heating gradually to 325 °C and holding for 5 minutes, then 375 °C for 5 minutes, at 450 °C for 15 minutes, and finally at 500 °C for 15 minutes. The resulting mesoporous TiO2 electrodes were semi-transparent. The projected area of the TiO2 layers was approximately 0.28 cm2 (circles with 0.6 cm diameter). The thickness of the electrodes was determined by an Alpha-Step IQ surface profiler (KLA-Tencor). Electrodes were then immersed into 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution (prepared by dilution of a 2 M stock solution which was prepared at ca. 0 °C) at 70 °C for 30 minutes and then rinsed with water followed by drying and heating on a hot plate in air at 500 °C for 30 minutes.
Preparation of CdSe-, CdS- and core–shell CdS/CdSe-sensitized mesoscopic TiO2 electrodes
Kapton tape was used to mask the bare FTO, leaving the mesoscopic TiO2 electrodes (0.6 cm diameter) uncovered, they were sensitized with CdS and CdSe using previously reported SILAR methods.10,19,31 In a typical procedure, the TiO2 electrodes were dipped into a solution containing 0.03 M cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, Fluka, >99.0%) in ethanol for 30 seconds, to allow Cd2+ to adsorb onto the TiO2, and then rinsed with ethanol for 2 minutes to remove the excess Cd2+ in an argon filled glove box. Electrodes were then dried in an argon atmosphere for 2 minutes. Subsequently, the dried electrodes were then dipped into a solution containing 0.03 M Se2− for 30 seconds, where the pre-adsorbed Cd2+ reacts with Se2− to form the desired CdSe. The Se2− solution was prepared by mixing selenium dioxide (SeO2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4, Sigma Aldrich) in ethanol following the work reported by Lee et al.19 One deposition cycle was completed by further rinsing in ethanol for 2 minutes and drying again in an argon atmosphere for 2 minutes. This procedure was repeated several times to get suitable CdSe loading on TiO2 electrodes. To prepare CdS/CdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrodes, CdS layers were deposited prior to the deposition of CdSe by the SILAR method, where TiO2 electrodes were dipped into a solution containing 0.02 M Cd(NO3)2·4H2O in methanol for 1 minute, and then rinsed with methanol for 1 minute to remove the excess Cd2+. Electrodes were then dried in a gentle stream of N2 for 1 minute. The dried electrodes were then dipped into a solution containing 0.02 M sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O, Sigma Aldrich, >98%) in a mixture of methanol and deionized water (1:1, v/v) for 1 minute, where the pre-adsorbed Cd2+ reacts with S2− to form the desired CdS. Electrodes were then rinsed in methanol for 1 minute and dried again with N2. This procedure was repeated several times to get suitable CdS loading on TiO2 electrodes. A ZnS passivation layer was deposited on the CdSe and CdS/CdSe-coated TiO2 electrode by SILAR using 0.1 M aqueous zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, Sigma Aldrich, >99.5%) and 0.1 M aqueous Na2S·9H2O, dipping for 1 minute in each solution, with 1 minute of rinsing in deionized water between each immersion in a precursor solution.1,32 All the CdSe and CdS/CdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrodes used in this study were coated with two ZnS passivation layers.
Material characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of TiO2 nanoparticle electrodes on glass slides sensitized with CdS, CdSe and CdS/CdSe were carried out with a Bruker D8 using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.154059 nm). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental analysis of the above electrodes was carried out using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, ZEISS, SUPRA 40). The optical density measurements of CdS, CdSe and CdS/CdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrodes were carried out in a transmission mode utilizing a single beam in a Shimadzu UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Solidspec-3700).
Fabrication and characterization of CdSe and CdS/CdSe-sensitized TiO2 solar cells
Brass foil (alloy 260, Alfa Aesar) was polished with sand paper and an alumina suspension (de-agglomerated 1.00 and 0.05 micron) then cleaned by ultrasonic bath and deionized water. The clean brass foil was then etched in 37% HCl at 70 °C for 5 minutes to expose more copper from the copper–zinc matrix and the yellowish color of the brass changed to dark red.1,10,33 The etched brass was then rinsed with deionized water and dried at 70 °C. One drop of an aqueous polysulfide solution containing 1 M S and 1 M Na2S·9H2O was added onto an unmasked part of the etched brass causing it to suddenly become black, indicating the formation of Cu2S. Platinized FTO counter electrodes were fabricated with small holes drilled into one corner of FTO. After cleaning, a thin layer of Pt was deposited onto the FTO by thermal decomposition of hexachloroplatinic acid. To fabricate SSCs with Cu2S cathodes, a hole was made within 1 mm of the edge of the TiO2 layer on the photoanode. Photoanodes and cathodes were sealed together in a sandwich configuration using a hot-melt polymer (Surlyn, DuPont). The inter-electrode space was filled with an electrolyte by vacuum back filling. Holes were sealed using a small piece of hot-melt polymer and a microscope coverslip. The electrolyte was composed of 1 M S, 1 M Na2S·9H2O and 0.1 M NaOH in deionized water. IPCE spectra were measured with a spectral resolution of ca. 5 nm using a 300 W xenon lamp and a grating monochromator equipped with order sorting filters (Newport/Oriel). The incident photon flux was determined using a calibrated silicon photodiode (Newport/Oriel). Photocurrents were measured using an auto-ranging current amplifier (Newport/Oriel). Control of the monochromator and recording of photocurrent spectra were performed using a PC running the TRACQ Basic software (Newport). Current–voltage (j–V) characteristics under simulated AM 1.5 illumination were measured using a Keithley Source Meter and the PVIV software package (Newport). Simulated AM 1.5 illumination was provided by a Newport solar simulator and the light intensity was measured using a calibrated Si solar cell. The cells were scanned from forward to reverse bias at a scan rate of 12.5 mV s−1 for j–V measurements. The active area of the cells was defined by a mask to be 0.1199 cm2. Impedance spectra were measured using an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat and the Nova 1.6 software package. Experiments were performed with cells under illumination provided by a red LED (centre wavelength λ = 627 nm) and biased at the VOC induced by the illumination. The highest light intensity used was sufficient to produce a VOC approximately equal to that obtained under AM 1.5 1 Sun illumination and the incident photon flux was of the order of 1017 cm−2 s−1. A 15 mV RMS voltage perturbation was used and the frequency range was 105 Hz to 0.1 Hz. Different illumination intensities were achieved using neutral density filters mounted in an automated filter wheel system (Newport), which was controlled by the Nova 1.6 software. Impedance measurements were carried out in the order of descending light intensity.
Results and discussion
Morphology and structural characterization

Fig. 1(a) shows a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the as-grown CdSe on ∼25 nm sized TiO2 crystal grains after 7 cycles of SILAR deposition (denoted as 7CdSe). It is evident that while the lattice fringes of the TiO2 crystal grain with d-spacing 0.35 nm are clearly seen, its surface is conformally covered with a 3–4 nm thick amorphous layer, which is presumably the deposited CdSe. For comparison, the cascade 5CdS/5CdSe (the best performing sensitizer) was also measured (Fig. 1(b)). However, layers of CdS and CdSe on the edge of TiO2 crystal grains were not seen rather an amorphous like material was observed, which is presumably the deposited 5CdS/5CdSe.

The CdS, CdSe and CdS/CdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrodes were further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) as shown in Fig. 2, which reveals that the as-grown sensitizers on TiO2 are amorphous in nature. However, all the electrodes except individual CdS show broadened characteristic diffraction peaks after heat treatment at 350 °C for 2 hours in an evacuated (∼10−6 mbar) quartz tube, indicating the presence of the crystallized phase of CdSe. The presence of CdS causes a slight shift and broadening of the XRD peaks of the CdS/CdSe electrode with respect to the pure CdSe. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental analysis was used to determine the atomic ratio. It shows that Cd/Se is 0.99 in 7CdSe, and Cd/(S + Se) is 0.98 in 5CdS/5CdSe, being almost stoichiometric. These as-prepared electrodes were used directly for optical measurements, solar cell fabrication and characterization in the subsequent sections.

Optical properties of CdSe and CdS/CdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrodes
The absorption spectra of SILAR-deposited sensitizers on TiO2 are depicted in Fig. 3. While the maximum absorption appears at ∼400 nm for all the electrodes, the absorption onset of CdSe is significantly red shifted and its peak absorbance is much greater than that of CdS. Similarly, the absorption onsets of the 5CdS/nCdSe electrodes shift to longer wavelengths with increasing deposition cycles (n = 1–5) of CdSe from ∼550 nm for 5CdS/CdSe to ∼700 nm for 5CdS/5CdSe, much longer than the onsets of individual CdS and CdSe layers for the same number of SILAR deposition cycles, consistent with previous observations of Lee et al.21 It should be noted here that, to achieve an identical absorbance the deposition cycle “n” may vary with the actual deposition conditions, such as concentration and volume of precursor solutions, solvents, duration for reaction and rinsing steps, size of electrodes, temperature, etc. In the present study, as 5CdS/5CdSe was found to be the best-performing cascade-structured sensitizer, it was then chosen for other characterizations and compared with the CdSe.
As more CdSe layers are deposited, a characteristic hump appears in the spectra of 5CdS/nCdSe between 500 and 700 nm and shifts to longer wavelengths with increasing deposition cycles (Fig. 3(b)). Interestingly, these humps are missing in the spectra of nCdSe alone for the same deposition cycles (Fig. 3(a), n = 1–5), for which the peak absorbance is much lower and the onsets are greatly blue shifted compared to that of 5CdS/nCdSe. Ning et al. recently demonstrated enhanced light absorption from a type-II heterojunction interface when core–shell ZnSe/CdS quantum dots were used as sensitizer for TiO2, where the absorption onset is changed to a longer wavelength due to the narrowing of the effective band gap as a result of the interfacial optical transitions from the valence band maximum of ZnSe to the conduction band minimum of CdS at the heterojunction interface.34 Although the junction of CdS/CdSe and TiO2 was reported to be type-II based on ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements,28 the significant absorption hump here seems unlikely to originate from the CdS/CdSe heterojunction interface considering the small absorption cross-section. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3(a) CdSe alone exhibits such characteristic humps as well when more material was deposited by increasing SILAR deposition cycles to n ≥ 6. So, the long wavelength hump and the enhanced light absorption for cascaded CdS/CdSe at any given number of SILAR cycles is very likely a result of more CdSe being deposited. This is supported by the recent reports that the nucleation and growth of CdSe on TiO2 can be greatly accelerated with a CdS underlayer,21,22 where CdS is rather a promoter for the preferential growth of CdSe. Consequently, a larger amount of CdSe was actually deposited with a 5-cycle deposition, effectively reaching the OD of CdSe deposited on bare TiO2 by 7 cycles (Fig. 3(a) and inset of 4(a)).

The OD spectra represent the net light absorption by the sensitizers as the substrate absorption (mesoporous TiO2) was subtracted from the absorption spectra of corresponding nCdS, nCdSe and 5CdS/nCdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrodes. Tauc plots of (c) nCdSe-coated TiO2 electrodes and (d) 5CdS/nCdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrodes. 
To estimate the effective band gap of these sensitized electrodes, the above absorption spectra were presented in Tauc plots (Fig. 3(c and d)).35 With increasing SILAR deposition cycles, the intersection of the base line with the tangent line of the linear region of the plots shifts towards lower energy, indicating that the effective band gap of the deposited semiconductor sensitizer becomes narrower. The Tauc plot shows that both 7CdSe and 5CdS/CdSe electrodes possess an effective band gap of ∼1.9 eV, further implying the identical optical property of the two electrodes. In addition, the stacking of absorption spectra observed beyond 700 nm is believed to be caused by light scattering effects, which systematically increase with deposition cycles.21,23
Photocurrent–voltage characteristics
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of CdSe and CdS/CdSe-sensitized mesoscopic TiO2 electrodes, sandwich type thin layer cells were fabricated with Cu2S as the counter electrode, and a polysulfide electrolyte as the hole transporter. To ensure the CdSe sensitizer alone has identical OD to that of cascaded CdS/CdSe, 7 cycles of CdSe were deposited which presents approximately the same OD over the whole wavelength range as the most optimized 5CdS/5CdSe (Fig. 4(a), inset). Scattering layers were not used for the 7CdSe and 5CdS/CdSe electrodes here in order to avoid the comparison between different photoanode structures and to simplify the interpretation of impedance data. A thin ZnS passivation layer (2 cycles) was deposited onto the sensitized electrode by the same SILAR method to hinder the backward electron flow from sensitizers to the oxidized species in sulfide/polysulfide electrolyte.1,21,36 The IPCE spectra of both CdSe and CdS/CdSe-sensitized TiO2 solar cells exhibit strong photoelectrical response over the entire visible light range, with photon wavelengths even extending to ∼800 nm. As shown in the IPCE spectra of Fig. 4(a), both electrodes exhibit identical external quantum efficiency of ∼75% between 400 and 600 nm, while the CdSe-sensitized electrode presents much superior IPCE at longer wavelengths (>650 nm), contributing to the improvement of photocurrent.
 Fig. 4  IPCE spectra (a) and j–V characteristics (b) of cells made with 7CdSe and 5CdS/5CdSe-sensitized 5 μm thick TiO2 electrodes, and the 8CdSe, 9CdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrodes consisting of a 5 μm P25 transparent layer and 4 μm thick scattering layers (WER2-O, Dyesol). The inset of (a) shows their OD spectra. Cu2S and sulfide/polysulfide were used as the counter electrode and electrolyte, respectively. 

Table 1 summarizes the device data using 5CdS/5CdSe and 7CdSe electrodes with identical OD and the optimized 8CdSe and 9CdSe electrodes incorporating a light scattering layer. It is clear that CdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrodes demonstrate better photocurrent and photovoltage in j–V measurements, where a power conversion efficiency of 4.1% was attained under simulated AM 1.5 100 mW cm−2 illumination when no scattering layer was employed. In contrast, the cell performance is slightly impaired when CdS is used as an underlayer in cascaded CdS/CdSe electrodes, despite the identical light absorption. The presence of a scattering layer greatly promotes the IPCE of 9CdSe-sensitized TiO2 cells in the long wavelength region, which leads to a power conversion efficiency of 5.21% under AM 1.5 100 mW cm−2 illumination, one of the highest cell efficiencies achieved so far for liquid junction SSCs prepared by SILAR.

Investigation of charge transport and recombination processes using impedance spectroscopy
Impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements of the cells (using platinized FTO counter electrode for improved stability) were performed to further investigate the role of the CdS underlayer. Good fits to most impedance spectra of cells made with photoanodes of identical OD could be obtained using an equivalent circuit based upon the diffusion–reaction model for porous electrodes in which the distributed components of the transmission line are the charge transfer resistance (rct), the electron transport resistance (rt), and the electrode capacitance (cμ).37,38 The distributed parameters are related to total resistances and capacitances by rt = RtA/d, rct = RctAd, and cμ = Cμ/(Ad) where d and A are the thickness and projected area of TiO2 electrodes. TiO2 electrodes of thickness 5 and 10.3 μm were used to make cells for IS analysis; therefore, the obtained parameters Rct, Rt, and Cμ from the fitting results were normalized to the film thickness and the projected cell area.
As shown in Fig. 5, while the cμ–VOC plots for both cells are nearly identical within a wide range of bias voltage, rct for the cell with a 7CdSe electrode is ∼2 times higher than for the cell with a 5CdS/5CdSe electrode at the same quasi-Fermi level, indicating that the presence of CdS underlayer in 5CdS/5CdSe cells promoted the backward interfacial charge transfer. As a consequence, the VOC of 5CdS/5CdSe is slightly lower than that of the 7CdSe cell. The accelerated recombination could arise from the presence of trap states introduced by the CdS buffer layer in between TiO2 and CdSe, which is plausible since an extra interface is present in the CdS/CdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrode as compared to that of the CdSe electrode. Hod et al. have recently reported that the chemical capacitance of semiconductor-sensitized TiO2 measured by impedance spectroscopy is a combination of localized states in both TiO2 and semiconductor sensitizer, which are indistinguishable and represent a single entity.39 If it were the case, the detailed recombination mechanism for electrodes using the CdS buffer layer would be very complex. Unambiguous interpretation of the origins of the trap states and their roles in charge recombination would require systematic investigation of different electrode configurations, which is beyond the scope of the present study. In addition, we note that the 627 nm light used in the impedance measurement will not directly excite the CdS in CdS/CdSe electrodes, which intuitively would hinder charge separation under the illumination conditions. However, if CdS simply acts as a barrier between the TiO2 and the CdSe and/or the electrolyte, then recombination would be suppressed. In fact, an opposite result in the recombination resistance was observed here as derived by the impedance measurements, further supporting the above conclusions.
 Fig. 5  Dependence of distributed charge transfer resistance (rct), electron transport resistance (rt) (a) and chemical capacitance (cμ) and electron diffusion length divided by film thickness (Ln/d) (b) on open circuit photovoltage for SSCs utilizing 7CdSe and 5CdS/5CdSe-sensitized 5 μm TiO2 electrodes and platinized FTO counter electrodes. The j–V performances of these cells are shown in ESI (Table S2 and Fig. S1, ESI†). 
Warburg impedance representing finite length electron diffusion in TiO2 can be clearly observed in the IS spectra in the photovoltage range of 0.1–0.3 V. As shown in Fig. 5(a), in contrast to recombination the fitted electron transport impedances of both CdSe and CdS/CdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrodes are fairly comparable. The corresponding electron diffusion lengths (Ln) are then determined which is at least 2 times greater than the TiO2 film thickness, sufficient to ensure unity charge collection in both cells.23 Similar results were also found for devices made with 10.3 μm thick TiO2 electrodes (Fig. S2, ESI†).
The reliable determination of effective diffusion length of electron in the sensitized electrode allows for rigorous evaluation of charge separation efficiency in both cells. The IPCE of SSCs can be conceptually factored into three parts: light harvesting efficiency ηlh(λ), charge separation efficiency ηsep(λ), and charge collection efficiency ηcol(λ).IPCE = ηlh(λ)ηsep(λ)ηcol(λ)
The charge separation efficiency depends on the carrier injection efficiency and the sensitizer regeneration efficiency. The diffusion length of electrons was found to be at least two times the TiO2 film thickness at all voltages from IS measurements, which implies a near unity charge collection efficiency. The light harvesting efficiency was estimated from the OD spectra of the electrodes. We can then simulate the IPCE spectra utilizing the OD spectra of the corresponding electrodes by varying the separation efficiency to match the actual IPCE spectra (Fig. S3, ESI†). A correction for electrolyte absorption (aqueous polysulfide electrolyte) at short wavelengths was also made, while the porosity of TiO2 electrodes 0.5 was used for simulation and the charge separation (electron injection/hole scavenging) yield was allowed to vary to obtain a good fit. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the simulated IPCE spectra only match at shorter wavelengths, which gives an average charge separation efficiency of ∼88% for both electrodes. At longer wavelengths disagreement between simulation and experiment arises due to uncorrected light scattering by the electrodes. It is interesting to note that in a recent study faster charge transfer from CdS/CdSe to TiO2 was observed when compared with that of CdSe/CdS-sensitized electrodes (CdSe is deposited in between CdS and TiO2).29 However, since the obtained charge separation efficiency for both cells is quite similar at short wavelengths, no evidence was found here that the presence of the CdS buffer layer could favorably facilitate charge separation as compared to the CdSe-sensitized electrodes.
Although the influence of sensitizer configuration on IPCE was not evidently observed at shorter wavelengths, the enhanced external quantum efficiency of CdSe cells at longer wavelengths (>650 nm, Fig. 4(a)) clearly infers that CdSe-sensitized TiO2 possess superior charge extraction capability to that of CdS/CdSe cells for the charge carriers generated by low energy photons. Considering that both cells have unity charge collection and nearly identical light harvesting, the enhanced IPCE of 7CdSe at longer wavelengths would only be a result of facilitated charge separation, while it is deteriorated by the presence of the CdS interlayer. Since sensitizer regeneration has no significant wavelength dependence, the enhancement of charge separation could be further attributed to facilitated charge injection from CdSe to TiO2, which is however impeded in the presence of the CdS buffer layer.
To understand the wavelength-dependent charge injection arisen from different electrode configurations, it is speculated that a type I band alignment was formed between CdS and CdSe on TiO2 as illustrated in Fig. 6(a). While it is pertinent to note that UPS measurement has indicated a type II junction between CdS and CdSe when deposited on TiO2,28 a type I band alignment is not impossible considering the inhomogeneous deposition of CdSe on CdS, where the preferential growth of CdSe would lead to a significant shrinkage of the band gap and consequently downward shift of the conduction band. Actually such situation is not rare and the formation of type I band alignment between CdS and CdSe has been reported in core–shell quantum dot hetero-structures.40–42 As a result, the relative band position displacement of CdS and CdSe may give rise to a straddled band alignment with the conduction band minimum of CdSe lower while valance band maximum higher than that of CdS. As such, while hot electrons generated in CdSe43 by short wavelength photons (hν1) are still energetically favorable to transfer into TiO2 through the conduction band of the CdS layer, those generated by long wavelength photons (hν2) might be hindered in the presence of the CdS buffer layer as an energy barrier in between CdSe and TiO2. In contrast, charge carriers generated by these long wavelength photons would viably be injected into TiO2 in CdSe cells, as shown in Fig. 6(b).
 Fig. 6  Speculated band alignment of CdS/CdSe (a) and CdSe-sensitized TiO2 (b) prepared by the SILAR method. The type I band alignment between CdS and CdSe could be caused by the inhomogeneous deposition of the light absorbing layers on TiO2. CdSe excited by short wavelength (hν1) and long wavelength (hν2) photons shows different charge injection, contingent to electrode configurations. 
At the end of the article, it is worthwhile to mention the recent work by Pan et al.,44 who demonstrated an efficiency of 5.32% utilizing an inverted type-I core–shell CdS/CdSe QDs-sensitized TiO2 electrode, where TiO2 and CdS were separated by the CdSe. This reverse configuration is somewhat supportive to the above argument, while unambiguous understanding requires systematic studies.
Conclusions
From the above comprehensive study it is concluded that CdSe-sensitized TiO2 solar cells possess noticeably slower charge recombination at the TiO2/CdSe interface, and much enhanced light harvesting of long wavelength photons, giving rise to superior overall device performance of the cascaded CdS/CdSe cells. These findings lead to the important conclusion that while the CdS buffer layer might still be indispensable in some kinds of SSCs,45,46 it is actually redundant and even causes efficiency losses in CdSe-sensitized TiO2 solar cells. We anticipate that with the discoveries presented in this study, the performance of semiconductor-sensitized mesoscopic solar cells could be further promoted by rigorous interfacial engineering to improve charge separation and mitigate charge recombination.
