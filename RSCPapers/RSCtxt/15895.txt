    , Accepted 10th May 2016First published on 11th May 2016AbstractExtensive efforts have been focused on the study of wide-band gap (WBG) polymers due to their important applications in multiple junction and ternary blend organic solar cells. Herein, three WBG copolymers named PBDT(X)-T1 (X = O, S, Se) were synthesized based on the benzodithiophene (BDT) donor unit and 1,3-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (T1) acceptor unit. Different aromatic heterocycle groups (furan, thiophene and selenophene) were introduced to modify the BDT unit to investigate the influence of conjugated side chains on the photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers. Photophysical properties, electrochemistry, charge transport and crystalline properties of the polymers were studied to discuss the role of chalcogen atoms on the performance of conjugated polymers. Solar cells based on these three WBG copolymers were fabricated. Among them, the PBDT(Se)-T1-based solar cell shows the best photovoltaic performance with the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.52%, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.91 V, and a high fill factor (FF) of 72%. The high crystallinity and preferential face-on orientation in the blend film partially explain the superior photovoltaic performance achieved in PBDT(Se)-T1-based solar cells. The results indicate the important role of chalcogen atoms in conjugated side chains and that high photovoltaic performance can be realized through side chain engineering of BDT-based WBG conjugated polymers.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been intensively investigated due to their advantages of low cost, light weight, flexibility, and easy processing. Since Heeger et al. presented the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) concept for an active layer where a conjugated polymer donor and a fullerene derivative acceptor are mixed together to form bicontinuous inter-penetrating networks,1 extensive research efforts have been made in this area and led to PCEs over 10% for both single-junction and multi-junction PSCs.2–14 The remarkable achievements are mainly attributed to material developments.15–19 According to the optical bandgap (Eoptg), polymer donors can be divided into three types: wide-bandgap (WBG) (Eoptg > 1.8 eV), medium-bandgap (MBG) (1.5 eV < Eoptg < 1.8 eV) and low-bandgap (LBG) (Eoptg < 1.5 eV) polymers. Recently, WBG polymers have attracted enormous attention due to their important applications in multiple junction and ternary blend organic solar cells.20 In a multiple junction solar cell, the WBG polymers are usually used in the front cell to absorb shorter wavelength sunlight to compensate for the absorption of the rear cell. Meanwhile, a larger open-circuit voltage (Voc) can be achieved in the same device, yielding a higher PCE than that of the single-junction solar cell.
The development of high performance WBG polymers is still lagging behind those of the MBG and LBG conjugated polymers. Until now, very few WBG polymer donors have shown PCEs more than 8%.21–26 Recently, Cao and coworkers have reported a PCE of 9.13% from the inverted solar cells based on a donor–acceptor copolymer PThBDTP.23 Zhang et al. developed a high-performance benzodithiophene (BDT)-based WBG polymer PBDTBDD with a PCE of 9.2%.24 Very recently, our group has designed a high performance copolymer named PDBT-T1 composed of an electron-rich DTBDT subunit and a strong electron-deficient subunit 1,3-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (T1). Solar cells processed with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) exhibit an impressive PCE of 9.7%.25 Despite the progress achieved in the past few years, the overall performance of WBG polymer donors is still relatively lower than those of the MBG and LBG copolymers. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to design and synthesize high-performance WBG polymers.
From the view of structure optimization, conjugated polymers could be divided into two constructions which are the conjugated main chains and the side chains. Currently, the major research on WBG polymers is mainly focused on the main chain modifications mentioned above. Recently, we used a furan unit to replace thiophene in the main chain of conjugated polymers. PSCs fabricated with PBDF-T1 show a higher PCE than that of its BDT counterpart.26 Then, we found that the incorporation of a selenium heteroatom in the conjugated WBG polymers could result in a higher photovoltaic performance than its sulfur counterpart.27 The introduction of heteroatom substitution (the group 16 elements: oxygen, sulfur, selenium and tellurophene) on the conjugated main chains or the side chains has been shown to be a very promising strategy for effectively constructing the LBG polymers.28–35 Being inspired by the promising results, we would like to investigate the side chain effects on the photovoltaic properties for WBG polymers. Therefore, three WBG polymers with different aromatic heterocycles (furan, thiophene or selenophene groups) at the conjugated side chains were synthesized and characterized under comparable conditions. The chemical structures of PBDT(X)-T1 (X = O, S, Se) are shown in Scheme 1. The thermal, optical, and electrochemical properties, charge transport, crystallinity, molecular stacking and morphology of the active layer were studied to discuss the effects of chalcogen atoms and the correlations between the molecular ordering and the electronic properties. Optimized PBDT(Se)-T1:PC70BM BHJ solar cells give a decent PCE of 8.52%, which is higher than those of PBDT(O)-T1 and PBDT(S)-T1 based cells.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic processes used to prepare the desired polymers PBDT(X)-T1 (X = O, S, Se) are shown in Scheme 1. The acceptor unit T1 was synthesized according to our previously reported methods.25 For the donor units, three BDT based monomers (3a–c) were fabricated with different aromatic heterocyclic functional groups (2a–c), 2-(2-ethylhexylthio)furyl, 2-(2-ethylhexylthio)thienyl and 2-(2-ethylhexylthio)-selenophenyl, by the lithiated active reaction in THF. Then, the trimethyltin functionalized BDT moieties (4a–c) were synthesized through reported methods. Finally, the functionalized BDT moieties (4a–c) were copolymerized with T1 respectively to prepare three new WBG polymers PBDT(X)-T1 by the classical Stilling coupling reactions. These polymers could be dissolved in chloroform and were easily characterized. The values of weight-average molecular weight (Mw) for PBDT(O)-T1, PBDT(S)-T1, and PBDT(Se)-T1 were 52.3k, 66.5k, and 82.4k, respectively, with their polydispersity indices (PDI) as 1.9, 2.8 and 2.1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) has been utilized to evaluate the thermal properties of the polymers under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The three polymers show great thermal stabilities with 5% weight loss temperatures at 252, 323 and 310 °C, respectively (as shown in Fig. S1†).
Optical properties

Fig. 1 displays the UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers recorded in chloroform solution and thin film on quartz substrates, and the corresponding optical data, including the absorption peaks (λabs), absorption edge wavelength (λonset) and their optical band gaps are shown in Table 1. The polymers have two absorption peaks, involving a pronounced π–π* transition peak at 360–380 nm and an intramolecular charge-transfer transition peak at 565–620 nm for donor–acceptor polymers.28 The absorption spectra of the three polymers in thin films are identical in shape to their solution spectra. However, there is a typical observation that obvious red-shifts of absorption peaks in films are found for PBDT(O)-T1, PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 because of large aggregation of the polymer main chains and π–π intermolecular interactions occurring in the solid state.30 All polymer films show broad absorption spectra covering the wavelength ranging from 300 nm to 700 nm. The absorption edges of the three polymer films are at 711 nm for PBDT(O)-T1, 684 nm for PBDT(S)-T1 and 687 nm for PBDT(Se)-T1 corresponding to the optical band gap of 1.74, 1.81 and 1.80 eV, respectively.

Electrochemical properties
The electronic structures were estimated by cyclic voltammetry. Fig. 2a shows the cyclic voltammetries of the three polymers. When potential cycling was applied, these polymers are electrochemically stable. The onset oxidation potential (Eox)/onset reduction potential (Ered) of PBDT(O)-T1, PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 are 0.51/−1.35, 0.72/−1.24 and 0.73/−1.24 V vs. Ag/Ag+ respectively. The calculated HOMO and LUMO levels are summarized in Table 1. The LUMO levels of PBDT(O)-T1, PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 are −3.45, −3.56 and −3.59 eV respectively. We find that the LUMO levels of PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 are close, but they show values ca. 0.1 eV lower than that of PBDT(O)-T1. For the HOMO levels, a similar result is shown. The HOMO levels of PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 are −5.52 and −5.53 eV, respectively, which show values ca. 0.21 eV lower than that of PBDT(O)-T1. The changes of the the LUMO and HOMO levels of different aromatic heterocycle substituted polymers are mainly due to the difference in the electron-donating strength of heterocyclic groups.30 These phenomena indicate that the conjugated side chains could significantly affect the electronic structures of the copolymers. There is a difference between optical band gap and electrochemical band gap for the polymers with the values about 0.2 eV, due to the exciton binding energy.28,36

Fig. 2b shows the energy level diagrams of the materials used in the solar cell devices. The LUMO levels of the polymers are all located within a suitable energy level and show values 0.3 eV higher than that of PC70BM (ca. −3.91 eV), which means efficient exciton dissociation could be expected to occur in their interfaces. In the meantime, the polymers PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 possess rather low-lying HOMO levels. The Voc in PSCs is proportional to the difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor, so higher Voc of the devices with the two polymers as donors is anticipated.
Theoretical simulation
To further understand the electronic distribution and geometrical configuration of these polymers, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. In order to simplify the calculations, a series of BDT(X)-T1 trimers were set as the modelling oligomer lengths, and the long alkyl side chains were replaced by methyl groups. The simulated electron density distributions and the dihedral angles between the side chain groups and the main chains of the conjugated polymers are shown in Fig. 3.

For the calculated HOMOs of these polymers, extended delocalization is featured along the entire conjugated backbone, which is affected by both the donor and acceptor units. In comparison, the calculated LUMOs also have similar densities of states, but the effects on the acceptor units are overwhelming. For the geometrical configuration of these polymers, the dihedral angle between the furanyl side group and BDT is 34.4° for BDT(O)-T1 trimers, which is much smaller than those (57°) in the BDT(S)-T1 and BDT(Se)-T1 trimers. The lower dihedral angle between the furanyl group and BDT in BDT(O)-T1 will lead to more effective electron conjugated length over the electron-donating furanyl side chain, so it will provide a higher HOMO level than those of the other two polymers.37,38
Hole mobility
Charge carrier transport properties in pristine polymer films were investigated using organic field-effect transistors. Typical output and transfer curves are presented in Fig. S2.† As can be seen from the transfer curves, the devices show typical p-type transport properties. The hole mobilities of PBDT(O)-T1, PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 are 3.13 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 5.30 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.34 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. In contrast, the values of PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 are nearly 100 times as high as that of PBDT(O)-T1. The difference in charge carrier mobilities has proposed that PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 show higher crystallinity than PBDT(O)-T1.
Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the copolymers PBDT(X)-T1, a series of conventional BHJ PSCs were fabricated with PBDT(X)-T1 as donors and PC70BM as acceptor by using chloroform as a processing solvent. The devices were fabricated with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM/Ca/Al structure, and the fabrication process of the device is described in detail in the Experiment section. The same device fabrication and optimization procedures were used for all polymers. It is known that the weight ratios of donor and acceptor in active layers play important roles in the performance of PSCs. Thus, three different weight ratios of 1:1.5, 1.1 and 1.5:1 (w/w) for PBDT(X)-T1:PC70BM blend films were examined. And, a small amount of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used to optimize the active layer morphology. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables S1 and S2.† It can be found that both the weight ratio and DIO concentration play important roles in determining device performance. Obviously, the optimal ratio and additive for three BHJ blends were found to be around 1:1 (w/w) and 0.7% (v/v), respectively.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices fabricated with optimal conditions under simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 4a. The parameters of the optimized devices are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen clearly that the Voc, short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE are all increased gradually when the side chains of BDT units of polymers are changed from furan, thiophene to selenophene. In terms of the Voc parameter, the devices based on PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 show high values of 0.89 and 0.91 V, respectively. However, a slightly lower Voc value of 0.83 V is obtained for the PBDT(O)-T1-based device, due to its relatively high HOMO value. Regarding the Jsc parameter, the devices based on PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 donors gave similar values of 12.43 mA cm−2 and 13.04 mA cm−2, respectively, which are much higher than that of the device incorporating PBDT(O)-T1 (9.92 mA cm−2). It is noted here that a similar tendency is observed for FF. Compared to the low FF value of 49% in PBDT(O)-T1-based solar cells, the devices based on PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 show higher FF values of 68% and 72%, respectively. Therefore, PCEs of solar cells with PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 are 7.48% and 8.52%, respectively, which are nearly two times higher than those of the devices with PBDT(O)-T1. Compared to PBDT(S)-T1 based devices, slightly higher Voc and Jsc values render better PCEs for PBDT(Se)-T1-based solar cells. The higher Voc is mainly due to its slightly deeper HOMO value. The higher Jsc is partially attributed to its broad optical absorption, good phase separation and molecular ordering in the BHJ blend films.

Fig. 4b exhibits the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) plots of solar cells with three polymers as donors. All devices exhibit similar response ranges from 300 to 700 nm and similar shapes, in which the short wavelength sunlight in the range of 300–450 nm is mainly attributable to the contribution of PC70BM and the photoconversion efficiencies in the long-wavelength range of 450–700 nm are mainly corresponded to the absorption of the polymers. The IPCE values differ very much for these three different copolymers. The maximum IPCE peak of PBDT(O)-T1 is about 53%. However, the IPCE values of PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 exceed 60% in the 350–650 nm range with a maximum of 69% and 72% at 560 nm, respectively, much higher than that of PBDT(O)-T1. These results agree well with the J–V measurements.
Film morphology
It is known that photovoltaic properties are greatly affected by the morphology of the active layers. In order to further gain insight into the morphology of these polymer:PC70BM blends, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out. As shown in Fig. 5, without using the additive DIO, all blend films appear as rough surfaces with a large number of grain boundaries, which tends to reduce charge mobility and exciton dissociation. The root mean square (RMS) roughnesses of PBDT(O)-T1, PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 blend films are 3.36 nm, 3.58 nm and 1.89 nm, respectively. With the addition of 0.7% DIO, uniform and smooth surfaces were clearly observed for PBDT(O)-T1 and PBDT(S)-T1 blend films and the RMS values decreased to 1.84 nm and 2.20 nm, respectively. For the PBDT(Se)-T1 blend film, it was found that the roughness increases from 1.89 nm to 2.55 nm after the additive treatment, which may be attributed to the large phase separation occurring in the active layer.

Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed to investigate the crystallinity and molecular orientation in both neat and blend films. Fig. 6 shows the 2D GIWAXS patterns of neat and blend films and the corresponding out-of-plane and in-plane line cuts. Bragg reflections at qxy = 0.303, 0.264 and 0.279 Å−1 correspond to the lamellar (100) diffraction peaks of PBDT(O)-T1, PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 films, respectively. The lamellar stacking distances for the three polymers differ slightly, which is probably attributed to the effects of chalcogen atoms on the molecular ordering.

Bragg reflections at qz = 1.72 Å−1 are attributed to π–π stacking (010) peaks of these films. It is noted that a strong π–π stacking peak was observed in the out-of-plane direction, located at 1.72 Å−1 for all these three copolymers, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 0.36 nm. Due to the observed weak π–π stacking peaks in the in-plane direction, all neat polymers adopt a preferential face-on orientation. It can be seen that PBDT(S)-T1 presents a sharp π–π stacking peak, indicative of its better crystallinity than the other two polymers. The results agree well with the carrier mobilities measured using OFETs. When mixed with PC70BM, the intensity of the π–π stacking peak of PBDT(O)-T1 completely disappeared, indicating that the PC70BM severely destroyed its crystallinity. For PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 blend films, no obvious changes were observed in their lamellar and π–π stacking directions. Similarly, π–π stacking peaks of PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 are very weak in the in-plane direction, and thus the preferential face-on orientation of these two polymers is preserved in their blend films. This might explain the reason that PBDT(S)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1 show better photovoltaic performance than PBDT(O)-T1. In comparison with PBDT(S)-T1, PBDT(Se)-T1 in the blend film exhibits increased face-on preference since a weaker lamellar diffraction peak and a similar π–π stacking peak in the out-of-plane direction were observed. The better face-on orientation is helpful to the vertical carrier transport and results in higher Jsc and FF values in PBDT(Se)-T1-based solar cells.
Conclusions
In summary, three WBG polymers with conjugated side chains containing different aromatic heterocycles (furan, thiophene or selenophene groups) were synthesized and characterized. PBDT(Se)-T1 and PBDT(S)-T1 possess deeper HOMO levels and larger bandgaps than PBDT(O)-T1. Solar cells based on the PBDT(Se)-T1:PC70BM blend with 0.7% DIO exhibited a PCE of 8.52%, which is higher than those of PBDT(O)-T1 and PBDT(S)-T1 based cells. The high crystallinity and preferential face-on orientation in the blend film partially explain the superior photovoltaic performance achieved in PBDT(Se)-T1-based solar cells. The results indicate the important role of chalcogen atoms in conjugated side chains. Moreover, it is possible to realize high-performance WBG copolymers through side chain engineering.
Experiment
Materials
All chemical reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was freshly distilled from sodium/benzophenoneketyl prior to use. All reactions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. Benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b]dithiophene (BDT) and 1,3-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (T1) were prepared according to the reported methods.25
Instrumentation

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 600 MHz spectrometer using CDCl3 as the solvent. TGA measurements were performed on a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 thermogravimetric analyzer. UV–vis absorption measurements were carried out on a Hitachi (model U-3010) UV–vis spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements were carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell using a platinum plate as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode on a Zahner IM6e Electrochemical workstation in a tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) (0.1 M) acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a NanoMan VS microscope in the tapping mode. GIWAXS measurements were accomplished at PLS-II 9A U-SAXS beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory in Korea. X-rays coming from the in-vacuum undulator (IVU) were monochromated (Ek = 11.065 keV, wavelength λ = 1.10994 Å) using a Si(111) double crystal monochromator and focused both horizontally and vertically at the sample position (450 (H) × 60 (V) μm2 in FWHM @ sample position) using a K-B type mirror system. The GIWAXS sample stage was equipped with a 7-axis motorized stage for the fine alignment of the sample, and the incidence angle of the X-ray beam was set to be 0.12°–0.14° for the pristine and blend films of various ratios. GIWAXS patterns were recorded with a 2D CCD detector (Rayonix SX165) and the X-ray irradiation time was 6–9 s, dependent on the saturation level of the detector.

FET device fabrication and characterization
Organic FET devices for hole mobility measurements were fabricated in the conventional bottom gate and bottom contact structures with doped n-type Si substrates as the gate, and then, 300 nm SiO2 was thermally grown as the dielectric layer. The source and drain electrodes were patterned using standard photolithography and were formed on SiO2 with 5 nm titanium and 30 nm gold. The polymers PDBT(X)-T1 were dissolved in CHCl3 with a concentration of 2.5 mg mL−1, and then spin cast on top of octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-treated SiO2/Si substrates with a spin-coating rate of 2500 rpm. The devices were thermally annealed at 180 °C for 5 min. Electrical characterization was measured by using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor parametric analyzer. All measurements were performed under ambient conditions.
Solar cell fabrication and characterization
Polymer solar cells were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDBT(X)-T1:PC70BM/Al. The patterned ITO glass substrates were cleaned with detergent, water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, subsequently, and dried overnight in an oven. The PEDOT:PSS layer was spin cast from aqueous solution at 4000 rpm for 40 s, and dried in air at 150 °C for 10 min. The active layer solution of PDBT(X)-T1:PC70BM mixtures in CHCl3 prepared with different weight ratios and DIO concentrations was spin cast at 1700 rpm for 40 s. Finally, an aluminum layer (100 nm) under the vacuum conditions of 5 × 10−5 Pa was deposited by a thermal evaporation method. The active area of the devices was 4.50 mm2. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. The solar cells used an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator (Class AAA solar simulator, Model 94063A, Oriel) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which was measured by a calibrated silicon solar cell and a readout meter (Model 91150V, Newport). IPCE spectra were recorded by using a QEX10 Solar Cell IPCE measurement system (PV Measurements, Inc.).
