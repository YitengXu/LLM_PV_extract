    , Accepted 20th November 2012First published on 21st November 2012AbstractP-type cobalt oxide (CoO) nanowire arrays were synthesized via a hydrothermal process followed by thermal annealing. Then, n-type CdS nanoparticles were electrodeposited onto the CoO nanowires to obtain CdS/CoO nano-heterojunctions. The heterojunctions were utilized as the photocathode of solar cells, which show promising photoelectrical properties, particularly rather high photocurrents, due to efficient light absorption and improved carrier collection. This study demonstrates that the p-type CoO nanowire is an attractive candidate material for photovoltaic applications, and the hydrothermal synthesis combined with the electrodeposition process is a potential technique for producing low-cost solar cells.
Introduction
Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have attracted a great deal of attention as a renewable means of harnessing solar energy.1–4 However, QDSCs usually suffer from high electrical resistance due to the existence of a large number of interfaces.5,6 As a solution, single-crystalline nanowires (NWs), which have been demonstrated to be superior on electron transport and collection, can be incorporated into solar cells as the electrodes.7–10 Hitherto, NWs have attracted substantial consideration for QDSC applications.11–14 The majority of studies have been focused on the sensitization of n-type semiconductor NWs as the photoanode in QDSCs, while p-type semiconductor NWs have been studied less.15–17 In theory, p-type semiconductor NWs can be employed to improve the power conversion by working as the photocathode of a tandem solar cell, as well as an electron barrier layer to facilitate charge separation in QDSCs.17 Very recently, Yu et al. synthesized p-type PbS nanowires and incorporated them into Schottky junction solar cells, which exhibit the capability of collecting near-infrared solar energy.18 As for the QDSCs, some endeavours have been made using p-type NiO films as the photocathode, while p-type NWs have not been successfully introduced into QDSCs thus far.19–23
Cobalt oxide (CoO) is a wide band-gap (Eg > 2.60 eV) semiconductor, known as a stable and transparent transition metal oxide, which naturally displays p-type conductivity.24 Owing to their intriguing optical and electrical properties, CoO layers with different dimensions and morphologies have been applied in various electronic and optoelectronic devices. For instance, CoO NWs or nanoflowers have been extensively studied as electroactive materials for lithium-ion batteries,25 supercapacitors,26 and haemoglobin biosensors.27 However, to the best of our knowledge, the application of CoO NWs as the photocathode of QDSCs has never been reported. In the present work, we report on the preparation of CoO NW arrays covered with a thin layer of CdS quantum dots (QDs), which are then employed as the photocathode of QDSCs. The solar cells incorporating such a cathode exhibit promising photoelectrical properties, particularly a relatively high photocurrent, which indicates that p-type CoO nanowires are an attractive material for the photocathode of solar cells.
Experimental
The aligned CoO NW arrays on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate were synthesized by a hydrothermal process.28 In brief, a seed layer was first formed on the FTO substrate by the dip-coating method using a 50 ml ethanol solution of 0.1 M cobalt chloride (CoCl2) and 0.5 M urea (CO(NH2)2) followed by calcination at 450 °C for 4 h. The cobalt hydroxide carbonate NW arrays were then grown on the seeded FTO substrates via a hydrothermal process in 40 ml aqueous solution of 0.1 M of CoCl2 and 0.5 M CO(NH2)2 at 90 °C for 4 h. The as-prepared precursors were annealed under a constant flow of argon (50 sccm) at 450 °C for 4 h, allowing for the complete pyrolysis of cobalt hydroxide carbonate to pure CoO NWs. The electrodeposition of CdS QDs was subsequently conducted on the CoO NW arrays in a dimethyl sulfoxide solution containing 0.19 M cadmium chloride and 0.055 M sulphur with a constant electrodeposition current of 7.5 mA cm−2 at 110 °C. As a result, an electrode of CdS/CoO heterojunctions was obtained. For comparison, two reference electrodes were prepared, one with bare CoO NWs on FTO substrate, and the other with CdS films electrodeposited under the same conditions on FTO substrate.
The morphology of photocathodes was observed using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a FEI Technai G2 F20 transmission electron microscope (TEM) with a field-emission gun operating at 200 kV. The X-ray diffractometry (XRD) analysis for the crystal structure was carried out in a Rigaku D/max 2500 v/pc diffractometer. The optical properties were recorded on a Hitachi 3010 spectrophotometer.
For fabricating solar cells, one of the above electrodes and a platinized FTO counter electrode were sandwiched together with a transparent hot-melt surlyn ring. A polysulfide electrolyte solution, consisting of 0.5 M Na2S, 1.0 M S and 0.1 M KCl in a 7:3 volume ratio of methanol and water, was injected into the interelectrode space from the counter electrode side through a predrilled hole. Photocurrent density-voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2611 digital multimeter under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight at 100 mW cm−2.
Results and discussion
The top view SEM image shows that the as-synthesized CoO NW arrays are separated apart from each other adequately with a mean diameter of 100 nm (Fig. 1a). The side view SEM image (Fig. 1b) shows that CoO NWs with a length of ∼4 μm grew vertically from the FTO substrate, providing a smooth pathway for carrier transport and collection. The crystal structure of CoO NW was verified by XRD analysis (Fig. 1c). Besides the peaks originating form the FTO substrate, the other diffraction peaks can be indexed as the standard rock salt cubic CoO (JCPDS file No. 48-1719). The microstructure of the CoO NWs was investigated by TEM. Fig. 1d and 1e demonstrate that the CoO NWs are porous, while their surface is relatively smooth. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1d, inset) from the CoO nanowires exhibits several rings corresponding to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of the cubic phase of CoO. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1e) illustrates that lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.246 nm correspond to the (111) planes of CoO, indicating that the CoO NWs are highly crystalline. The chemical composition of the as-synthesized CoO NWs was determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. 1f), which indicates a Co/O atomic ratio of 1:1. Based on XRD, SAED and EDS characterizations, it is collectively concluded that CoO NWs are successfully synthesized.

Photoactive CdS nanocrystals were electrodeposited onto the surface of CoO NW arrays. After CdS deposition, the surface of the CoO NWs becomes rough, and the diameters of the CdS/CoO heterojunctions increase to approximately 100–150 nm (Fig. 2a and 2b). Fig. 2d is a TEM image of the as-deposited CdS/CoO heterojunctions, showing that the CoO NWs are densely surrounded by CdS QDs. The SAED pattern (Fig. 2d, inset) exhibits polycrystalline rings corresponding to the (100), (002), (101) and (110) planes of wurtzite CdS in addition to the rings of CoO NWs, which coincides well with the XRD analysis (Fig. 2c). The HRTEM image in Fig. 2e illustrates clear CdS (110) lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.207 nm. Furthermore, the EDS result shown in Fig. 2f indicates that CdS QDs are composed of Cd and S with an atomic ratio of 1. All of above results demonstrate the formation of CdS/CoO heterojunctions.

The absorption spectra of FTO glass, CoO NW arrays, CdS film and CdS/CoO heterojunctions are shown in Fig. 3. The FTO glass exhibits weak absorption from visible to near-infrared range and a sharp absorption edge at 400 nm. The growth of CoO NW arrays on FTO substrates drives the absorption edge to 470 nm, which corresponds to the band edge absorption of the CoO NW arrays with a band gap of 2.6 eV.29 After subsequent deposition of CdS QDs on the CoO NWs, the absorption intensity is significantly enhanced, and the absorption edge moves further to 520 nm due to the formation of nanocrystalline CdS.30–33

The electrical properties and photovoltaic effects of the CdS/CoO heterojunctions were investigated at room temperature. Fig. 4 shows dark photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the CdS/CoO heterojunctions. The rectifying behaviour indicates that a typical p–n junction is formed at the interfaces of p-type CoO NWs and n-type CdS QDs.34 The forward current density was found to be 0.2 mA cm−2 at an applied bias of −0.6 V, and it increased to 15 mA cm−2 when the value of bias was changed to +0.6 V. The J–V curves of CdS-sensitized CoO NW solar cells were measured under illumination through the FTO substrate. For comparison, data from the CoO NW arrays and the CdS film are also included in Fig. 5. The photovoltaic properties of these cells are listed in Table 1. It is seen that the short circuit current density of the CdS/CoO heterojunctions is significantly enhanced compared to those of the CoO NWs and the CdS film. The low VOC value arises from the small difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the CoO/CdS photocathode and the redox potential of the polysulfide electrolyte. Moreover, Fig. 5b shows that the photocurrent was stable during the on and off cycles of the illumination.

A schematic representation of the CdS/CoO heterojunctions solar cells is shown in Fig. 6. The CdS/CoO heterojunctions follow a photocathodic working mode, where CdS QDs absorb photons and generate excitons under illumination. Subsequently, electrons are captured by the electrolyte, while holes accumulate within the CdS QDs. The hole accumulation results in a negative photovoltage with respect to the electrolyte potential, hence holes inject from CdS QDs into the valance band of CoO NWs, and finally flow into the FTO substrate, leading to a cathodic photocurrent. The CdS/CoO heterojunction shows several advantages for improving the cathodic photocurrent, i.e. the efficient light harvesting of the CdS QDs attached onto the CoO NWs, the effective charge separation at the CdS/CoO interface, and the effective hole transfer of the CoO NWs. Therefore, a relatively high JSC of 4.42 mA cm−2 was obtained in the CdS/CoO heterojunction-based solar cell.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated a promising photocathode of CdS-sensitized CoO nanowire arrays on the FTO substrates, which capably harvests sunlight from the ultraviolet to visible range. CoO nanowire arrays are first grown on FTO substrates using a hydrothermal process, and CdS nanoparticles are sequentially electrodeposited on the CoO nanowires. By employing polysulfide electrolyte, the CdS-sensitized CoO nanowire solar cell shows a conversion efficiency of 0.11% with a superior JSC of 4.42 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Further improvement of VOC can be anticipated by combining the CdS/CoO photocathode with an n-type photoanode to form a tandem cell or altering n-type CdS quantum dots with p-type ones.
