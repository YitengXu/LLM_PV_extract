    , Accepted 8th January 2016First published on 11th January 2016AbstractNowadays, there is an increasing interest in solid solar cells based on organolead trihalides, which have achieved a certified efficiency of 20.1%. The success in perovskite solar cells extended the knowledge of perovskite materials and inspired their study for special solar architectures. Fiber-shaped solar cells are a type of photovoltaic device fabricated on one-dimensional conductive substrates, which could be potential candidates for wearable/portable electronics. In this study, we integrate the structure of Ti/c-TiO2/meso-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au into the fiber format. The fiber-shaped perovskite solar cells achieved a 5.3% PCE under AM 1.5 illumination and an apparent 8.4% efficiency in the diffuse model. The device design required no transparent conductive oxides and a thin film of gold nanoparticles was employed as a semitransparent top electrode. All the processes for device fabrication were easy to handle and energy-saving. The fiber devices exhibited high reproducibility, which could open new doors towards efficient solid fiber shaped photovoltaic cells.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite materials (e.g., CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) have attracted attention from both academia and industry because of their potential high performance and easy preparation.1,2 Perovskite materials have exhibited excellent light harvesting, high charge-carrier mobility, long exciton diffusion length, long excited carrier lifetime, and small exciton binding energy.3–6 PSCs functional layers could also be processed with solution or gas sources at rather low temperatures.7–9 PSCs have developed rapidly in the last three years, and achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.1%.10 The development of PSCs was claimed to begin a new era of photovoltaics and created new opportunities for future solar designs.11,12
As a solar architecture offering a special power supply, fiber-shaped solar cells are photovoltaic solar cells with a linear shape, which could harvest solar energy from 3D space due to their symmetrical structure and could be potential flexible power sources because of their adjustable aspect ratio.13 Recent flexible fiber shaped solar cells have shown the potential to be woven into clothes and can contribute to next generation wearable and electronic textiles.14 Fiber dye-sensitized solar cells can achieve efficiencies of up to 8%,15,16 but the volatile electrolyte requires additional packaging. Solid fiber solar cells could avoid the problem, but both organic and inorganic fiber photovoltaic cells exhibited relatively lower efficiencies (0.5% to 3.9%).17–19 Efficient PSCs may pave the way for potential breakthroughs for fiber photovoltaic devices. One of the main concerns of solid fiber devices is the top electrode materials that require an excellent balance between the transparence for sufficient light harvesting and the conductivity for good charge collection. In the early attempts, Peng et al. reported fiber-shaped perovskite solar cells with multi-walled carbon nanotube sheets as the top electrode and obtained a maximum 3.3% PCE,20 which opened a door for future improvement. But the non-metal material would suffer from increased resistance especially in large-sized devices. Minoh Lee et al. employed silver nanowires as the top electrode with spray-deposition, and their device exhibited a 3.85% PCE,21 but the deposition process of the silver nanowires may have done harm to the perovskite film and the detrimental effect of silver nanowires and hole-transport material led to S-shaped J–V curves. Considering the high performance of traditional perovskite solar cells, fiber-shaped perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) still have much room for improvement. Furthermore, high-quality film is the basic requirement toward efficient FPSCs. The fill factors of solid fiber solar cells have turned out to be a limiting factor probably because of non-preferable film morphology and interface defects on the curved substrate lead to limited photoelectron generation and charge transport. Moreover, the spin-coating process involved in a typical preparation may not be practical for wire substrates. Thus, attempts in materials selection, interface engineering, structure designs, and the preparation process will further enhance the basic performance of fiber-shaped perovskite solar cells and lay the foundation for future modularization.
In this report, we integrated typical perovskite solar cells into fiber-shaped devices and achieved a 5.35% PCE. To the best of our knowledge, the device performance was among the best results observed for solid fiber solar cells. CH3NH3PbI3−xClx was employed as a functional layer via simple dip-coating, and the thin film of gold nanoparticles produced via magnetron sputtering was used as a semitransparent top electrode for the fiber perovskite solar cells. The effects of electric heating, thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 layer, and morphology of the perovskite layer were studied. The preparation was easy to handle and the device reproducibility was promising. The results of our study may open new doors toward the development of efficient fiber solid solar cells.
Results and discussion
Referencing the structure of traditional PSCs, we designed novel FPSCs with the Ti/c-TiO2/meso-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au structure, as shown in Fig. 1a. The compact TiO2 layer was prepared in situ on a titanium wire via electric heating followed by dip-coating with TiO2 colloids to form a mesoporous layer. The CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite layer and spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport layer fabrication were solution-processed. The thin film of gold nanoparticles produced via magnetron sputtering was employed as a semi-transparent electrode for light harvesting and charge collection. This fiber is highly symmetrical and can harvest solar energy from 3D space. As shown in Fig. 1b, each functional layer could be observed in the cross-section of a shedding layer. A flexible gold wire (25 µm) was twisted around the fiber as the lead electrode (as shown in Fig. 1c). The FPSC is one-dimensional in the macro perspective, but actually has a three-dimensional microscopic structure. The methods and details for preparing the functional layers are presented as follows.

Because the substrate surface is highly curved and total thickness of the perovskite solar cell device is less than 1 µm, a substrate with smooth surface is required to avoid potential defects. Otherwise the film will become very uneven, which would aggravate charge recombination. For substrate pretreatment, mechanical polishing was used to smoothen the substrate surface, and a significantly improved surface smoothness could be observed after pretreatment (Fig. S1†). With pretreatment, the follow-up film quality could be guaranteed and lay the foundation towards high-efficiency FPSCs.
On this basis, a high quality compact layer is necessary to avoid a short-circuit.22 The solution method is the common method used in compact layer preparation. Isopropyl titanate acidic alcohol solution was used to coat the fiber, and the fiber substrate was annealed at 400 °C to generate a TiO2 compact layer.23 However, the compact layer of the fiber-shaped solar cells produced by the solution method cracks easily after annealing because the fiber surface was highly curved (Fig. 2a). To improve the quality of the compact layer, we used electric heating to generate a compact TiO2 layer in situ by oxidation reaction between the Ti wire and oxygen in the air. The film generated using this method was highly compact and complete (Fig. 2b) and could prevent the device from short-circuiting. The FPSC without electric heating obtained a Voc value of 0.624 V, Jsc value of 12.46 mA cm−2, FF of 0.398, and PCE of 3.09%. The FPSC with 2 min of electric heating achieved Voc of 0.601 V, Jsc of 12.30 mA cm−2, FF of 0.609, and PCE of 4.50%. An obvious FF improvement from 0.398 to 0.609 was observed because the compact TiO2 layer could improve the interface charge transfer and match the energy level of the perovskite layer. However, the thickness of the compact layer increased with increasing processing time, resulting in the large series resistance. An obvious decrease of the short-circuit current (Jsc) density from 12.30 to 3.94 mA cm−2 was observed as the heat time increased from 2 min to 20 min (as shown in Fig. 2c).

However, the smooth compact layer with high curvature was difficult to absorb perovskite materials. Thus, a mesoporous TiO2 layer was employed to increase the loading amount of perovskite functional materials. To generate a uniform, high-quality, and stable mesoporous TiO2 layer, a half-automation coating setup was used. TiO2 colloid was coated onto the fiber substrate with a current of 0.7 A for heating, to make the TiO2 porous layer smoother. The mesoporous TiO2 layer was annealed by electric heating instead of air heating. It is worth noting that the autologous heating process was more uniform and energy-saving than air heating, which could be applied to other optical electronics. The mesoporous TiO2 layer as prepared on the substrate was very uniform and smooth (Fig. 3a and b), and we found the process was highly repeatable. The thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 layer is an important factor to achieve high-efficiency FPSCs. Mesoporous TiO2 layers with different thicknesses were applied (including no mesoporous TiO2 layer) to FPSCs, and the efficiencies of the resultant devices were measured. Fig. 3c demonstrates that the optimized thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 layer was 300 nm, with Voc of 0.625 V, Jsc of 11.49 mA cm−2, FF of 0.636, and PCE of 4.57%. If the mesoporous TiO2 layer was thicker than 300 nm, which exceeded the exciton diffusion length of perovskite material and Jsc greatly decreased from 11.49 to 1.61 mA cm−2; however, when the thickness was less than 100 nm, the perovskite layer was discontinuous because the mesoporous TiO2 layer was too thin to adsorb enough active material (Fig. S2a†). In addition, the perovskite layer on the substrate without the mesoporous TiO2 layer presented obvious defects (Fig. S2b†), resulting in an almost non-functional device. Because the device performance was quite sensitive to mesoporous layer thickness, the optimized thickness was used in the following study. In addition, different types of mesoporous layers may improve the devices such as Al2O3 and SrTiOx.24 Study in this area is currently underway in our laboratory.

The morphology of the perovskite layer is also crucial to solar cell performance.25 We adopted a DMF solution of CH3NH2I and PbCl2 as precursors because the one step process is suitable for exploring different coating processes. In the present study, the morphology of the perovskite film could be regulated by applying different coating processes of dip-coating and infiltration (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Surface morphology of perovskite film after (a) dip-coating once, (b) dip-coating twice, (c) 2 min of infiltration, (d) 2 min of infiltration then dip-coating, (e) 10 min of infiltration, and (f) 10 min of infiltration then dip-coating. 
In Fig. 4a to f, a non-uniform perovskite layer can be deposited after three different coating processes: dip-coating once (Fig. 4a), 2 min of infiltration (Fig. 4c), and 10 min of infiltration (Fig. 4e), and many discrete blocks were formed. We found that a second cycle of dip-coating with the same infiltration duration can induce the perovskite film to become more homogeneous, as shown in Fig. 4b, d and f. Although the surface morphology was similar, different infiltration durations had visible impacts on the PCE of the FPSCs (as summarized in Table S1†). The perovskite precursor solution infiltrated into the mesoporous TiO2 layer fully with an appropriate infiltration duration. For excessively long infiltration durations, the coating layer may re-dissolve; however, at short infiltration durations, the perovskite material could not fully infiltrate into the mesoporous TiO2 layer. In the experiments, the optimal PCE of FPSCs (Voc of 0.677 V, Jsc of 11.23 mA cm−2, FF of 0.582, and PCE of 4.42%) was observed for 2 min infiltration and dip-coating. As shown in Fig. 5, a homogeneous perovskite capping layer was formed, which could inhibit carrier recombination.26 If the perovskite capping layer was non-uniform, the hole-transport layer perhaps could not completely cover the perovskite layer and may result in a short-circuit. We believe that dip-coating speed and infiltration duration both impact surface morphology by a dynamic process. Moreover, the thickness of the perovskite layer and its influence were studied by adjusting the perovskite precursor solution concentration. The thickness of the perovskite layer increased with increasing the perovskite precursor solution concentration. When the concentration increased from 20% to 40%, the PCE of FPSC improved from 0.1% to 4% (Fig. S3†).

Given that the perovskite layer could only harvest light passing through the top electrode, transparent conductive materials are indispensable for FPSCs. The thin film of gold nanoparticles was prepared via magnetron sputtering,27 which was almost harmless for the as-prepared layers, and the process used would be easily industrialized. The transmittance of gold thin film with different sputtering times is provided in Fig. S4.† Considering that the gold nanoparticles (20–50 nm) were dotted on the sublayer surface (Fig. 6a and b), the accurate thickness of the gold layer could not be determined. We notice that the transmittance and conductivity of the gold thin film could be balanced by varying the sputtering time. The measured relationship between the surface resistance and the transmittance is shown in Fig. 7. When magnetron sputtering process durations was increased from 10 s to 25 s, the surface resistance of thin film reduced from 72 Ω cm−2 to 6 Ω cm−2, whereas the transmittance of the gold layer decreased from 79% to 64% (at 525 nm). When sputtering the gold thin film for 15 s, the transmittance was about 76%, which is enough for solar energy harvesting. The surface resistance was 12 Ω cm−2, which is very similar to the surface resistance of commercial FTO glass (∼11 Ω cm−2). Thus, we regard this condition as the best balance of transmittance and conductivity for FPSCs.

To ensure accuracy of the FPSCs measurement, the abovementioned active part that was not twisted with the gold wire but could contribute to photocurrent was cut off. Upon layer-by-layer optimization, the best-performing FPSC achieved a 5.35% PCE with a Voc of 0.713 V, Jsc of 12.32 mA cm−2, FF of 0.609 (Fig. 8a), which is currently the highest PCE ever reported for FPSCs. In a series of repeated device preparations, a quarter (25%) of the devices achieved efficiencies >4% (Fig. 8b), which was higher than most literature results for solid fiber solar cells. For example, organic fiber solar cells achieved 3.9% PCE in the study of A. Gaudiana et al.,18 and silicon p–i–n junction fibers obtained 0.5% PCE in the study of V. Badding et al.17 The average efficiency of 40 devices was 3.36%, indicating a high level of reproducibility of device fabrication in the present period. In addition, we prepared an active length of 2.5 cm FPSC that exhibited a high fill factor (Voc of 0.633 V, Jsc of 10.27 mA cm−2, FF of 0.703) in our study (Fig. S5†), which is the highest fill factor ever reported for FPSCs. The high fill factor could be attributed to the matched energy levels,28 smooth morphology and suitable thickness of each functional layer, and large interfacial contact of the gold nanoparticles as a top electrode in the device. We made a quintessential model planar device for IPCE measurements, which showed an integrated Jsc of 13.42 mA cm−2 (Fig. S6†).

In this case, the forward and backward scan results were barely different (Fig. 8c).
The FPSCs featured a 3D light harvesting property similar to other fiber-shaped solar cells. The diffused light received by the reflector enhanced the apparent efficiency by 175% (from 4.83% to 8.43%), which can enhance power outputs for practical applications (Fig. 8d).
Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated fiber-shaped perovskite solar cells with a maximum PCE of 5.35%, which is among the best reported for solid fiber solar cells. CH3NH3PbI3−xClx was employed as the functional layer via a simple dip-coating process, and a thin film of gold nanoparticles applied through magnetron sputtering was used as the semitransparent top electrode for the FPSC. The effects of electric heating in situ preparation of a compact TiO2 layer, thickness of TiO2 porous layer, morphology of perovskite layer were studied. All the preparations were easy to handle and the device reproducibility was promising. The developed solid fiber solar cells may be further developed into wearable devices such as the strap of a smart watch. Our study may pave the way toward developing efficient solid fiber solar cells.
Experimental section
Materials
The Ti wire used was 250 µm in diameter (Alfa Aesar, 99.7%). Commercial TiO2 nanoparticle paste (Dyesol DSL 18NR-T) was diluted with ethanol (1:7 w/w) and then placed in an ultrasonic bath for 24 h.
Perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving CH3NH3I and PbI2 (molar ratio of 3:1) in DMF with a 40 wt% concentration. A hole transport material solution contain 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, which was added 17.5 µL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) and 28.8 µL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine.29
Device fabrication
Fiber-shaped perovskite solar cells were fabricated on Ti wires with a 250 µm diameter. First, the Ti wires were polished by the mechanical method and cleaned sequentially with deionized water, acetone, and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min. The compact TiO2 layer was prepared by electric heating the titanium substrate in the air with a current of 1.58 A for 2 minutes. Ti wire was dip-coated by a dilute commercial TiO2 nanoparticle colloid solution along with electrical heat at 0.7 A to form the mesoporous TiO2 layer. The wire was then heated with a current of 1.58 A for 20 min. The as-prepared wire was dip-coated by the perovskite precursor solution with the given coating process followed by annealing at 100 °C for 60 min in nitrogen. The wire was dip-coated into the spiro-OMeTAD solution for 2 min. Finally, the Ti wires were fixed into a rotating apparatus, and the thin gold electrode was uniformly coated by magnetron sputtering. A gold wire (25 µm in diameter) entwined the FPSCs for adjunctively transferring electric current.
Measurements
Part of the FPSCs without gold wire entwining were cut off to confirm the active area, and the part of device without gold nanoparticles were scraped to expose the Ti wire as an anode. The self-standing fiber device was measured without any other substrate unless otherwise specified. The J–V curves of the FPSCs were then measured under AM 1.5 illumination (YSS-5A, Yamashita DESO, Japan). The PCE was calculated according to ref. 13.
Film morphology was observed via field emission SEM (S-4800 Hitachi, Japan). The transmittance of thin gold layers was determined via a UV-visible spectrometer measuring at 525 nm.1,30
