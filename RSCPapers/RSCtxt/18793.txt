    , Accepted 15th June 2021First published on 15th June 2021AbstractZwitterions, due to their unique chemical structures and electric charges, have attracted continuous attention in organic/perovskite solar cells (OSCs/PSCs). They are widely used as interfacial materials in both OSCs and PSCs, and have been recently exploited as excellent dopants to passivate the defects and stabilize the black phase of perovskite films. This review summarizes the recent progress in zwitterionic materials toward their application in OSCs and PSCs, through the concepts of interfacial dipoles and their functions as interlayers, and the discussion on the regulation of perovskite films. In terms of interfacial modification, ultrathin zwitterionic materials, thickness-insensitive zwitterionic materials applied on metals and zwitterionic materials applied on metal oxides are listed. Based on their functions, zwitterionic dopants are described in terms of passivating defects and stabilizing phase.
1 Introduction
The term ‘Zwitterion’ is originally derived from the German word ‘zwitter’, which can be roughly translated as ‘hybrid’ or ‘hermaphrodite’. A zwitterion is an ion that possesses both positive and negative electric charges, and the total charge of the molecule is zero.1 Bearing both cationic and anionic moieties, the ‘inner salts’ are superior super-hydrophilic materials. Zwitterionic compounds have stable and separated unit electric charges on atoms, and the charged atoms are usually held together by one or more covalent bonds. These compounds usually contain quaternary ammonium cations.2
The oppositely charged ions, connected covalently to each other, produce stable dipoles in the same molecule. The strong Coulomb interaction between cations and anions together with the hydrocarbon matrix makes the zwitterions amphiphilic, and be attached easily to interfaces with either nature.2 This character enables zwitterions to be used as interfacial materials in photovoltaic devices including organic/perovskite solar cells (OSCs/PSCs).
To date, the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of single-junction PSCs and OSCs have been improved to 25.5% and 18.2%,3–8 respectively. For both PSCs and OSCs, the mismatch of the energy levels between the active and transport layers and the metal electrodes will lead to an energy barrier that impedes the transport of charge carriers.9–11 There is still plenty of space to improve the performance of photovoltaic devices in terms of PCE and stability through appropriate interfacial engineering, for example, introducing cathode interfacial layers (CILs) to overcome the aforementioned obstacles.12–17 The dipoles generated by zwitterionic materials induce a vacuum shift so that the work functions (WFs) of metals or metal oxides are decreased, which increases the built-in electric field and facilitates the charge transportation.18–20
For PSCs, the quality of perovskite active layers is decisive to the performance of the final devices. Perovskite films are usually prepared by solution processing and rapid crystallization at relatively high temperatures, and hence defects like under-coordinated Pb2+, Pb–I anti-site defects and grain boundaries are unavoidable.21,22 These defects have big chances to become a non-radiative recombination pathway.23 Improving the quality (mainly crystallinity) and surface smoothness of perovskite films is fairly important. Besides the composite control of the perovskite and adding additives into the precursor, the selection of interfacial materials beneath the perovskite films becomes the top most important issue. These interfacial materials should exhibit good affinity to both the adjacent layers, so that the solvents for perovskite precursors can spread on it and cannot dissolve it.24
Now coming back to zwitterions, their energy levels, special solubility, dipoles, affinity to polar and nonpolar solvents, and orthogonal solubility make them ideal candidates for interfacial materials. In addition, both zwitterions and perovskite precursors possess ionic nature, and preformed coordination/ionic bonding makes zwitterions fantastic additives to control the quality of perovskite films, thus serving as a good solution to neutralize the charged defects in PSCs. This review introduces the state-of-the-art PSCs and OSCs from the perspective of the application of zwitterions as interfacial materials or additives in photoactive layers.

2 Zwitterionic molecules as interlayer materials
2.1 Theory: interfacial dipoles
The electric dipole moment (p) is defined as the magnitude of the charge q times the distance,  = q, and the direction of the vector  points from −q toward +q.25,26 Any asymmetric chemical bond or asymmetric molecule composed of atoms with unequal electro-negativity is associated with an electric dipole. Although the microscopic dipole moments cancel out in most (non-ferroelectric) bulk materials, the situation is different at interfaces. The inherent asymmetry of the interface usually aligns chemical bonds or induces the orientation of microscopic dipole moments near them.25 If charge transfer, polarization or electron cloud rearrangement occurs, even symmetric molecules will produce interfacial electric dipoles. When a large number of positive and negative charges are distributed asymmetrically in a thin layer, an electric dipole layer is formed, and it can be approximately arranged into multiple single electric dipole moments arranged side by side, resulting in a drop from the positive charge side to the potential (Fig. 1).
Although zwitterions are generally neutral in charge, they have dipole moments, which have electronic effects on the surrounding environment. This redistribution of charge caused by the orientation of the dipoles will reduce the WF of the metal.2
2.2 Interlayers clinging to electrodes
Optimization of interfacial layers is an efficient way to improve the performance of solar cells. Cathode interfacial layers (CILs) could adjust the WF of the metal cathode to decrease the energy barrier between the transport layer and the metal electrode, which is beneficial to enhance the charge extraction and transportation at the interface.

2.2.1 Ultrathin zwitterionic interlayers for OSCs. 
Because of their well-defined molecular structures and high purities, small molecules exhibit good reproducibility both in material preparation and device fabrication. Additionally, most of the reported interfacial materials contain various conjugated units to improve their electronic conductivity, whose commercial applications in low-cost and large-area manufacturing are limited due to the complexity of preparation. Therefore, non-conjugated small molecules with simple structures and good electron transport and collection ability are promising candidates for OSCs. Ge et al. presented a non-conjugated small-molecule zwitterion (denoted as OEABS; the chemical structure is shown in Fig. 2a) as a CIL.27 OEABS shows advantages in several aspects such as effective WF modification of the Al electrode, good electron selectivity, transportation and collection properties, low optical absorption, good film formation and orthogonal solution processability. Due to these excellent properties for interfacial materials, the PSCs based on OEABS exhibited an encouraging PCE value of 9.51%, which is improved about 19% than that of the devices without the CIL.

It has been proven that CIL materials with 3D structures work better than the linear analogues in OSCs.28,29 Therefore, a series of 3D small molecular CILs were designed by Peng et al. The molecules named TFN, TFB, TFO, and TFS (Fig. 2e) have the triphenylamine (TPA) unit as the core and the amino-terminated fluorene units as the arms.30 The pendant polar functionalities included the neutral amino group, quaternary ammonium ion, amino N-oxide, and sulfo-betaine. For devices based on PTB7:PC71BM, a high PCE of 10.1% was achieved.
Rhodamine 101 (see the chemical structure in Fig. 2b) is not a newly designed zwitterion, and it has been widely applied in dye-sensitized solar cells and biological fluorescent markers.31,32 Ouyang et al. found that it also works nicely as CILs to reduce the WF of both indium tin oxide (ITO) and the metal electrode.33 For p–i–n OSCs based on PCDTBT:PC71BM, Ca as the interlayer corresponds to the maximum PCE of 4.57%, while Rhodamine 101 as the interlayer of OSCs reaches a champion PCE of 6.15%. The PCE improvement should be ascribed to the match of the WF caused by the strong dipole moment of Rhodamine 101. They also demonstrated that rhodamine works nicely in n–i–p OSCs, where rhodamine is used to modify ITO.34 It leads to a drastic decrease in the WF of ITO by up to 0.97 eV. The n–i–p OSCs usually have lower PCE compared to the same photoactive materials but with p–i–n configuration. It is worth noting that Rhodamine 101 promoted the PCE of n–i–p OSCs to a level comparable to that of p–i–n OSCs.
In 2014, Emrick and Briseno et al. applied PSBMA (see the chemical structure in Fig. 2d) as WF reducers for n–i–p OSCs.35 The orthogonal solubility and strong permanent dipole moment of PSBMA (dissolved in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol) on the sulfo-betaine moiety were calculated by density functional theory (DFT). An ultrathin interlayer of PSBMA reduced the electron injection barrier between ITO and C70 by 0.67 eV. Inspired by the good WF-reducing effect, we introduced PSBMA as the CIL into OSCs and PSCs.36,37 The OSCs based on PSBMA showed a comparable device performance with that based on the typical CIL material poly[(9,9-dioctyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)2,7-fluorene)] (denoted as PFN). After modification, the OSCs based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM demonstrated a much higher PCE of 8.27% compared to that (6.95%) without PSBMA. The performance improvement is mainly attributed to the reduced electron barrier and the enhanced built-in field, which are supplied by the zwitterionic side groups. These results give a very good example that conjugated backbones may be not necessary for interlayer materials. In addition, PSBMA also shows big advantages in the preparation and cost comparison of the known PFN.


2.2.2 Ultrathin zwitterionic interlayers for PSCs. 
For p–i–n PSCs, PC61BM is widely used as the electron transport layer (ETL) because of its easy processing and excellent electron affinity. However, PC61BM as ETL has some drawbacks: (1) the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of PC61BM does not perfectly match with the WF of the commonly used metal cathode (i.e., Ag or Al); (2) PC61BM is prone to aggregates, and may form a poor coverage on perovskite films, which consequently leads to current leakage as a result of direct contact between the photoactive layer and the electrodes.38–40 To solve these problems, zwitterionic molecules are introduced as an interfacial layer between PC61BM and the cathode metal electrode (Table 1). This interfacial layer can not only reduce the WF of the electrode by forming an interfacial dipole on the surface to improve the electron extraction and transportation, but also fix the poor coverage of PC61BM on the perovskite layer. Ouyang et al. proved that Rhodamine 101 is also a wonderful interfacial material in PSCs.41 In their study, Rhodamine 101 and LiF double layers were employed as the CIL between PC61BM and Ag for MAPbI3-based PSCs. The PCEs were improved from 9.2% to 12.1% after introducing a single interlayer of Rhodamine 101 and then to 13.2% after introducing the double interlayers of Rhodamine 101/LiF.

Except Rhodamine 101, other zwitterionic molecules have been proven to be effective CILs on top of PC61BM in PSCs. The non-conjugated zwitterion 3,3′-(hexane-1,6-diylbis(dimethylammonionediyl))dipropanoate (denoted as HDAC, see the chemical structure in Fig. 2c), which is functionalized with carboxylate, was used as an interlayer between fullerene and the cathode of p–i–n PSCs.42 The PCE of the devices increased from 15% to 17% with the insertion of the HDAC interlayer. The performance improvement should be attributed to the formation of interfacial dipoles and the elimination of potential barriers at the interface of the electron transport layer and cathode.
Our previous study demonstrated that PSBMA also works well as interlayers in PSCs.43 It was employed as interlayers on top of PC61BM for better energy alignment and charge separation. After the insertion of PSBMA, the WF of Al was greatly decreased, which led to more effective electron injection, and consequently, the PCE was improved from 17.31% to 18.50%.


2.2.3 Thickness-insensitive zwitterionic interlayers for OSCs. 
All the zwitterionic interlayers introduced previously require strictly controlled ultrathin films. However, thickness-insensitive interlayers are more favourable and conducive as they are being applied in industrial manufacturing.44 This type of interlayers put forward high requirements for the conductivity and light transmittance of materials (Table 2).
2.2.3.1 Perylene bis-imide or bi-imide (PBI/PDI – the two names point to the same compound45)-based zwitterionic molecules. 
Limited by their conductivity, the thickness of zwitterionic interlayers cannot be increased, usually a few nanometres. In most of the cases, the optimal thickness appears in a rather narrow range, which makes thickness control very tricky. Li et al. designed and synthesized a zwitterion based on PBI (denoted as PDINO, see the chemical structure in Fig. 3a) and used it as CILs in OSCs.46 PBI is known for its high conductivity due to the π–π stacking interactions between the PBI moieties. Therefore, it is understandable that interlayers based on PBI are not sensitive to thickness. They also demonstrated that the WF-reducing effect of the PDINO allows high WF metals (such as Au and Ag) to be used as cathodes. Bearing relatively high conductivity, PDINO as interlayers is quite tolerant to the film thickness in the range of 6–25 nm. Using PDINO as CILs, the PCEs of p–i–n OSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM reached 8.24% and 8.16% with Al and Ag as the top electrodes, respectively. In contrast, the devices using Ca as CILs gained a maximum PCE of 6.98%, and are not stable because of the high reactivity of Ca. It is worth noting that a maximum PCE of 8.35% was also achieved using PTB7-Th as the donor material, and such an efficiency is the highest for the devices based on fullerene acceptors.

The zwitterionic interlayers based on PBI function nicely not only on fullerene OSCs, but also on non-fullerene OSCs. A typical example was demonstrated by Zhang and Fang et al. In their study, sulfo-betaine was introduced into PBI, resulting in a water-/alcohol-soluble zwitterion (denoted as PDI-z, see the chemical structure in Fig. 3b).47 As PDI-z being modified on Al, the SO32− groups cling to the Al electrode and the NR4+ groups stay on the surface. The interfacial dipole thus leads to a drastic decrease in the WF of Al, and it consequently acquired a maximum PCE of 11.23%. Like PDINO, PDI-z as ETL does not have strict requirements on the thickness of the films, which makes it a very good candidate for interlayers in printing fabrication techniques.
Another successful example of PBI-based zwitterions was reported by Emrick and Russell et al. Unlike the above two examples, they adopted polymers to include PDI units, in which the PDI components are embedded together with electrolyte dopants in the polymer backbone.48 The cationic electrolytes can suppress the aggregation of PDI monomers, leading to interlayers with a controllable thickness. Morphological study through AFM and TEM showed that the polymers formed fibril structures, which work as efficient electron transport channels. The conductivity of the films is correlated with the ratio of PBI in the polymer, higher ratio leading to higher conductivity (judging from the fact that polymers with 50 or 100 PDI units have much higher conductivity than those containing 10 PDI units). After optimization, the PCEs of the fullerene-based and non-fullerene-based OPVs were improved from 2.62% to 10.64% and from 3.34% to 10.59%, respectively. What's more, using these novel interlayers with efficient doping and high conductivity, PCEs of both fullerene- and non-fullerene-based OPVs exceeded 9% over interlayer thicknesses ranging from ∼3 to 40 nm. In addition, Emrick and Russell et al. also introduced both PDI and fullerene into the polymer zwitterions through the Menshutkin reaction.49 The extra fullerene resulted in a significant increase in the interfacial dipole and the charge transport ability of the corresponding films. Naturally, OSCs based on zwitterions showed improved PCEs of 10.74% and 10.10% for fullerene-based and non-fullerene-based devices, both of which are leading during the time of publication.
2.2.3.2 N-Doped zwitterionic fullerenes as interlayers. 
Emrick and Russell et al. designed and synthesized a tris(sulfo-betaine)-substituted fullerene (denoted as C60–SB), as shown in Fig. 3e.50,51 The C60–SB served as a thickness-insensitive cathode layer, taking advantage of the dual utility of C60–SB. Finally, PCEs as high as 9.23% were achieved with an ETL thickness of ∼40 nm. What's more, the insensitivity to the ETL thickness was found from 5 to 140 nm, with PCEs exceeding 8% across the entire thickness range. The C60–SB layers function both as electron acceptors and as cathode modification layers in n–i–p devices. The thickness-insensitive property should be attributed to the dual role of the zwitterionic fullerene. Duzhko and Emrick et al. employed a tetra-n-butyl ammonium iodide-doped C60–SB as a cathode interlayer, which significantly improves the photovoltaic performance of the devices.52 Compared to the intrinsic (undoped) zwitterionic materials, the doped interlayers further improved the average PCE from 8.37% to 9.68% for OSCs and from 12.53% to 15.31% for PSCs. The dopant increases the interfacial dipole at the C60–SB–Ag interface and reduces the effective WF of the cathode.
2.2.3.3 Star-shaped materials. 
Novel star-shaped non-conjugated zwitterionic molecules with different cores, including phosphorus atoms (G–P), carbon–carbon double bonds (G–C2), silicon hydrogen bonds (G–SiH), and silicon atoms (G–Si), were designed by Min and Bao et al.44 The electrical and optical properties of CILs were decided by the core, and the zwitterionic sulfo-betaine groups serve as the pathway for electron extraction and transport. Taking PTB7-Th:PC71BM as the photoactive layer, PCEs as high as 8.25–8.90% are achieved within a wide range of interlayer thickness (8–25 nm), much higher than that of the devices with only Al-electrode (6.10%), methanol-treated Al (7.11%), and Ca/Al (7.43%).

2.3 Modification of metal oxide transport layer

2.3.1 Zwitterionic materials@ZnO for OSCs. 
For OSCs, n–i–p devices have attracted more attention because of their higher PCE and better stability compared to p–i–n devices. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is regarded as an efficient ETL for n–i–p OSCs because of its suitable energy level, low cost, environmental friendliness, good stability and high transparency. However, there are some drawbacks that hinder their application, such as poor interfacial contact with the organic photoactive layer, poor conductivity and surface defects/traps.18,53–55 Covering the surface with a layer of zwitterions serves as an effective method to solve the above problems (Table 3). In addition, appropriate dopants to ZnO precursors can also restrain surface traps and increase the conductivity of the ZnO film, and consequently improve the FF and JSC of the corresponding devices. Li et al. designed and prepared an alcohol-soluble iso-indigo derivative (denoted as IIDTh-NSB, see the chemical structure in Fig. 4a) bearing thiophene and applied it as a novel modifier of ZnO in n–i–p OSCs.56 With IIDTh-NSB as the interlayer, the PCE of the devices based on PTB7:PC71BM reached 8.88% under optimal conditions, higher than that (7.40%) of the devices with bare ZnO. IIDTh-NSB can also be used as dopants to ZnO films, by which the PCE was improved to 8.50%. They demonstrated that either surface modification or doping of IIDTh-NSB can enhance the built-in potential, charge carrier density and mobility, exciton dissociation, and charge carrier extraction. These improvements are realized by the enhanced interfacial contact between the photoactive layer and ZnO. Furthermore, all the devices with IIDTh-NSB exhibited better stability than that of the devices without IIDTh-NSB. Kim et al. synthesized a non-conjugated zwitterionic polyelectrolyte based on poly(4-vinylpyridine) (denoted as PVPy-ZW, see the chemical structure in Fig. 4b), and applied it as CILs in OSCs.57 The formation of a favorable interfacial dipole at the cathode interface reduced the Schottky barrier for electron collection from the photoactive layer to the cathode. The n–i–p OSC based on ITO/ZnO/PVPy-ZW demonstrated a maximum PCE of 3.55%, which is better than that without PVPy-ZW.

2.3.2 Zwitterionic materials@SnO2 for PSCs. 
SnO2 has been considered as a promising ETL candidate since it possesses outstanding properties such as excellent electrical properties, suitable energy levels and high electron mobility. Unfortunately, owing to poor crystallinity with serious oxygen vacancies, there are intrinsic defects on the surface of SnO2 films. In addition, there is a misalignment of interfacial energy levels between the conduction bands of SnO2 and perovskite, which causes serious hysteresis in n–i–p devices.58–61 Therefore, surface modification of SnO2 provides a possible avenue to solve the above problems (Table 3).
For example, zwitterionic sulfamic acid (denoted as SA, see the chemical structure in Fig. 5) was employed as an interlayer between SnO2 and a perovskite film.62 Through the coordination bond between SnO2 and –SO3−, the oxygen vacancies of SnO2 were remedied, and through the electrostatic interaction between the perovskite and –NH3+ cations, the charged defects of the perovskite were passivated. Based on SA–SnO2, high-quality perovskite films with a large grain size were obtained, and the established dipoles allow for a barrier-free charge transfer. As a result, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) was enhanced from 1.11 to 1.15 V, and the SnO2–SA based device yields a remarkable PCE of 20.4%, compared to 18.2% of the devices based on pristine SnO2. What's more, the SnO2–SA based devices show long-term stability against moisture and oxygen. The zwitterionic compound 3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate (denoted as PPS, see the chemical structure in Fig. 5b) can cause the shift of the WF of SnO2 from 4.34 to 4.23 eV.63 Positively charged atoms in PPS can passivate Pb–I anti-site defects. With these desirable properties, Park et al. applied PPS as CILs in n–i–p PSCs. After modification, the charge extraction was more efficient, and the stability of the devices was greatly improved. The PSCs with doped spiro-OMeTAD as a hole transport layer (HTL) obtained a PCE of 21.43%. In contrast, the PSCs with a dopant-free HTL using green solvents exhibited a record-high efficiency of 20.5%. In particular, the obtained PSCs showed excellent long-term stability against light, heat and humidity. Marks and Facchetti et al. introduced non-conjugated zwitterionic small-molecule electrolytes (NSE), OEABS and MSAPBS (see the chemical structures in Fig. 5), as not only charge extracting layers for charge collection, but also as passivation layers between perovskite films and SnO2.64 This interlayer has effects on both SnO2 and perovskite films. Regarding SnO2, NSE strongly reduces the WF and passivates the ETL surface, thus yielding barrier-free charge transport. Regarding perovskite, NSE neutralizes the charged defects at the bottom interface and grain boundaries of the perovskite film. As a result, compared to PSCs fabricated on the pristine SnO2 ETL, which afford PCEs of ∼19%, the PCEs of the PSCs based on OEABS and MSAPBS reached 19.82% and 21.18%, respectively. Furthermore, PSCs bearing NSE interlayers show significantly suppressed hysteresis and enhanced stability under atmospheric conditions.

2.3.3 Zwitterionic materials@SnO2 for OSCs. 
Lee et al. reported an interfacial engineering strategy to achieve highly efficient and stable n–i–p OSCs via modifying the SnO2 ETL using the zwitterion non-detergent sulfo-betaine 3-(4-tert-butyl-1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate (denoted as NDSB-256-4T).65 After modification, the WF of SnO2 was greatly reduced, resulting in more efficient electron extraction and transportation. What's more, the NDSB-256-4T passivated the defects of SnO2 and provided better interfacial contact between SnO2 and the photoactive layer. Under optimized conditions, a champion PCE of 8.22% was achieved for the OSCs based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM, and the unencapsulated device maintained over 90% of the initial PCE after being stored for 5 weeks under atmospheric conditions.

2.4 Improving the affinity of uppper layers by PSBMA
PTAA is widely applied as HTLs in PSCs; however, it has relatively low surface energy, and therefore, the upper layer perovskite shows poor surface coverage.24 In the previous study, we have demonstrated that PSBMA (see the chemical structure in Fig. 2d) can effectively improve the affinity of PTAA to perovskite, and facilitate the crystallization of perovskite films.43 Due to the low surface energy and the high contact angle, the solution of the perovskite precursor cannot spread on the surface of PTAA. It was found that after introducing PSBMA, the perovskite precursor solution could spread more easily on PTAA, and the perovskite films become smoother and have less pin holes, as shown in Fig. 6. Consequently, the PCE of the PSCs was improved from 17.31% to 18.78%, and the VOC was surprisingly high, with a value of 1.09 V. In addition, the repeatability of the device was also remarkably enhanced. The performance improvement should be attributed to the reduced trap density of the perovskite.

2.5 Improving the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS
PEDOT:PSS owes high conductivity, but the conductivity is not high enough for PEDOT:PSS to be used as anode materials, mainly because of the existence of the insulating PSS moiety.66–68 Therefore, it is highly desirable to improve the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS in order to facilitate hole transport and consequently, to enhance the device efficiency.
Ouyang et al. employed zwitterions, (N,N-dimethylcarbamoyl)-4-(2-sulfoethyl)pyridinium hydroxide (denoted as DMCSP) (Fig. 7a), N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate (denoted as DDMAP) (Fig. 7b), and N,N-dimethyl-N-[3-(sulfooxy)propyl]1-nonanaminium hydroxide (denoted as DNSPN) (Fig. 7c), to improve the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS.69 The conductivity improvement should be attributed to the lowering of the energy barrier for charge hopping across the PEDOT chains, the loss of poly(styrene sulfonate) acid chains from the PEDOT:PSS film and the conformational change of the PEDOT chains. The highly conductive PEDOT:PSS films are possibly used as transparent anodes of OSCs to replace ITO.
 Fig. 7  The chemical structures of zwitterionic molecules applied in PEDOT:PSS to improve its conductivity. 
Yang et al. doped 3-(N-morpholino)-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid (denoted as MOPSO, see the chemical structure in Fig. 7d) into PEDOT:PSS to weaken the Coulombic attraction between the PEDOT and PSS components, which could induce an inward-directed surface potential dipole and consequently, increase the WF of the HTL.70 The conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films was enhanced by approximately two orders of magnitude. The doped PEDOT:PSS efficiently improved the PCE of OSCs based on donor materials with wide and narrow bandgaps to different extents by greatly enhancing the JSC.
3 Passivating defects and stabilizing phase of perovskites
3.1 Passivating defects
Defects in perovskite films and their surfaces are considered as one of the main reasons for the anomalous J–V hysteresis behavior of PSCs. Additives have a positive impact on the crystallization process, surface regularity, surface coverage and grain size of perovskite films. They can not only passivate defects, improve charge transfer and inhibit charge recombination, but also improve the stability of PSCs.21,71 According to structural classification, additives can be roughly divided into Lewis acids (such as metal cations72,73 and fullerene derivatives74,75), Lewis bases (such as O,76–78 S,74,79 and N donors80–82), halogen organic salts,83,84 organic solvents,85,86 nanoparticles,87,88 low-dimensional perovskites,89–91 ionic liquids,92–94etc. However, most of these materials with functional groups could only coordinate with either the negatively charged Pb–I anti-site defects or the positively charged under-coordinated Pb2+.95 It has been reported that zwitterions could passivate both the positively and the negatively charged defects simultaneously (Table 4).
To obtain uniform and high-electronic-quality perovskite thin films, Huang et al. applied a sulfonic zwitterion, 3-(decyldimethylammonio)-propane-sulfonate inner salt (denoted as DPSI, see the chemical structure in Fig. 8), as a dopant to tune the crystallization behavior and passivate the defects of perovskites through the reaction between the functional ligands and the perovskite.96 The dopant suppresses the pinhole formation, reduces the charge trap density, and elongates the carrier recombination lifetime. The passivation effect works particularly efficiently on large-area (1 cm2) devices prepared by blade-coating, and consequently, achieves a champion PCE of 18.3%.
 Fig. 8  The schematic diagrams of interactions between zwitterionic molecules and perovskites. 
Yang et al. added an imidazole sulfonate zwitterion, 4-(1H-imidazol-3-ium-3-yl) butane-1-sulfonate (denoted as IMS, see the chemical structure in Fig. 8), into CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) as a bifunctional additive.97 IMS can not only regulate the crystalline grain orientation, but also passivate the trap states. The passivation is realized via the coordination interaction between the sulfonate moiety of IMS and the Pb2+ ion, and the electrostatic interaction between the imidazole of IMS and the I− ion of MAPbI3.
Xu et al. synthesized a zwitterionic molecule bethanechol chloride (denoted as BTCC, see the chemical structure in Fig. 8), which contains a quaternary ammonium cation and a chloride anion, and applied BTCC as a dopant of the perovskite layer.98 Both the theoretical calculations and the experimental results indicate that BTCC can stabilize the Pb–I framework through hydrogen bonding with iodide anions, and passivate the defects owing to its zwitterionic functional groups. After being treated with BTCC, the perovskite films showed reduced trap density, eliminated non-radiative charge-recombination and prolonged carrier lifetime. The BTCC treatment led to an extremely high VOC of 1.14 V, and the corresponding PSCs gained long-term stability against moisture.
Squaraine (denoted as SQ, see the chemical structure in Fig. 8) zwitterions are known for their high absorption coefficients, tunable bandgaps and excellent photochemical and thermal stabilities. Hayase et al. designed and synthesized three SQ derivatives with halide substituents (noted as SQ45, SQ63, and SQ81).95 As indicated by the experimental data and DFT simulation, the SQ molecules with resonance-stabilized zwitterions could passivate the under-coordinated Pb2+ and Pb–I anti-site defects simultaneously on the perovskite boundary, leading to reduced trap density and controlled crystal growth. Furthermore, because of the good energy alignment between the highest occupied molecular orbital of the SQ molecules and the valence band of the MAPbI3 perovskite, the SQ molecules facilitate charge separation at the perovskite grain–SQ interface. One outstanding advantage is that the perovskite can be prepared in an ambient atmosphere with an RH of more than ∼60%, and the corresponding PSCs achieved a champion PCE of 18.83% (versus control 15.77%). The devices maintained 90% of the initial PCE for over 600 h under an atmosphere with an RH of 60 ± 5%.
Li et al. prepared a multifunctional sulfo-betaine-based zwitterionic surfactant tetradecyldimethyl(3-sulfopropyl)ammonium hydroxide (denoted as TAH, see the chemical structure in Fig. 8), which was applied as a dopant in perovskite.99 Their study revealed that this surfactant plays a synergistic role in controlling the quality of perovskite films. The advantages of this dopant of perovskite are summarized in the following three aspects: (1) for small active area PSCs, the PCE was elevated from 19.34% to 22.07% upon addition of 0.1 wt% TAH; (2) this dopant works in both p–i–n MAPbI3-based and n–i–p CsFAMA triple-cation-based PSCs; (3) upscaling the active area to 0.8 cm2 still maintains a superior efficiency over 21%. This study shows one of the highest records for the upscaling coated PSCs.
3.2 Stabilizing phase
All-inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 possesses excellent stability against moisture and heat, and hence has attracted increasing attention.100,101 However, CsPbI3 could quickly transit from the black phase (α-phase) to the yellow phase (δ-phase) at temperatures below 315 °C. Huang et al. found that doping sulfo-betaine zwitterion (denoted as SB3-10, see the chemical structure in Fig. 9a) into CsPbI3 can stabilize the black phase.102 Their results suggest that the zwitterion can effectively impede the crystallization of CsPbI3 due to its electrostatic interaction with the ions and CsPbI3 colloids. The corresponding PSCs maintained 85% of the initial PCE after being stored in air for over 30 days.

Recently, PSCs with mixed-cation formulations of MA, FA, and Cs have been gaining a lot of research attention, since they exhibit a record performance. Nevertheless, the volatile nature of MA drags down the thermal and moisture stability of the corresponding PSCs. Thus, MA-free perovskites are expected to be the candidate materials for the commercialization of PSCs because of their superior stability.103 What's more, FAPbI3 has a slightly narrower bandgap of 1.48 eV, close to the best theoretical value of 1.34 eV for a single-junction solar cell. Unfortunately, the thermodynamically metastable characteristics and larger tolerance factor of FAPbI3 cause the photoactive black cubic phase (α-phase) perovskite to degrade to a non-photoactive yellow orthorhombic phase (δ-phase) under ambient conditions. In order to block this phase transition, smaller inorganic cations (Cs+) are mixed with the cation part to promote the crystal structural stability of FA-based perovskites by adjusting the tolerance factor. Although α-phase MA-free films can be obtained by this way, directly formulating the perovskite inks to avoid an additional step remains a major challenge in the scalable fabrication of PSCs. Recently, among the techniques used to fabricate scalable devices, blade-coating as an emerging and facile film deposition method has gained significant success in preparing large-area perovskite films. Unluckily, the poor film with defects and pinholes produced by the blade-coating process with fast crystallization resulted in poor device performance. Cao et al. used the zwitterion 3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate (denoted as PPS, see the chemical structure in Fig. 9c) to stabilize the α-Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 perovskite.104 On one hand, PPS can slow down the crystallization rate by interacting with the precursor ink, inhibiting the formation of the undesired δ-phase of FA-based perovskite films. On the other hand, the negative sulfonic group and the positive ammonium group of PPS can passivate the charge defects and prolong the carrier lifetime. Consequently, a dense and uniform large-area α-Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 perovskite film was obtained by blade-coating. The small-area (0.1 cm2) device achieved the best PCE of 18.9%, and the large-area (1 cm2) device achieved the best efficiency of 16.2%. In addition, the PPS-based device also exhibited excellent moisture and thermal stability. The devices maintained 88% of the initial efficiency after aging for 1000 h in air at room temperature under a 40–50% RH, and maintained 82.5% of the initial efficiency after aging for 500 h at 85 °C under a N2 atmosphere.

4 Conclusions and outlook
The development of solar cells has been accompanied by the exploration of interfacial materials. Zwitterionic materials, due to their unique electric charges, play important roles in interfacial engineering. Permanent surface dipoles are applied to regulate the energy level alignment between electrodes and photoactive layers. Their excellent affinity to solvents and photoactive materials makes zwitterions perfect interlayers to glue the adjacent layers, and allows the formation of high-quality photoactive layers. When incorporated with conjugated molecules, zwitterionic materials become quite tolerant to thickness in terms of the performance of OSCs and PSCs. For PSCs, the quality control of perovskite films makes a big contribution to the PCE elevation. Zwitterions have been proven as amazing dopants in perovskite films to passivate the defects and stabilize the black phase (α phase). Passivating the defects and stabilizing the black phase are attributed to the interaction between functional groups of zwitterions and perovskite, which drastically improves device performance including PCE and stability. Zwitterions have been proven as promising materials either as interlayers of OSCs/PSCs or as dopants in perovskite films.
The past decade witnessed the rapid development of both OSCs and PSCs. The PCEs of these two types of photovoltaic devices are high enough for commercialization. The simple procedure of fabrication, flexible nature of photoactive materials and extremely low cost (compared to silicon-based devices) promise a new generation of solar cells. Challenges still exist regarding the application of zwitterionic materials in both OSCs and PSCs. (1) How far can zwitterionic materials go in solar cells is still an unknown question. (2) For a better charge transportation, the energy of LUMO (ELUMO) of the cathode interface layer should be lower than the ELUMO or the conduction band of the intrinsic semiconductor, so zwitterions which possess suitable energy levels are better to be used as cathode interface layers. But presently, most of the zwitterionic materials do not possess this characteristic. Therefore, it is necessary to further develop zwitterionic materials that are more matched in energy levels. (3) Different categories of zwitterionic materials are seldom put into the same frame to compare their interfacial and doping properties for solar cells. Systematic studies are highly required, since different photoactive materials and device configurations may lead to different results. (4) Non-conjugated zwitterionic materials usually do not possess the charge transportation character alone, and hence they require extra charge transportation materials. What will be the best combination theoretically and experimentally? This question still leaves an open discussion.
