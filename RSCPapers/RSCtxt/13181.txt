    , Accepted 19th June 2018First published on 20th June 2018AbstractIn this study, we fabricated porous fiber-like g-C3N4 photocatalysts by calcifying melamine to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance via a facile supramolecular hydrogel approach. The as-prepared g-C3N4 microwire (MW(III)) photocatalysts significantly enhanced hydrogen production under solar irradiation (16.88 μmol h−1). The performances of photocatalysts fabricated from the same precursor via calcification improved with the increase in the crystallinity and the degree of polymerization. The use of different precursors led to variations in crystallinity, but H2 production was correlated with the crystallinity of the photocatalysts synthesized from the same precursor with a similar trend. This study provides a novel strategy to synthesize metal-free g-C3N4 photocatalysts via increasing the crystallinity and degree of polymerization.
1. Introduction
Energy resource shortage and environmental deterioration have challenged human society to develop novel materials that can utilize the solar light effectively and efficiently through technology innovation. Photocatalysis provides certain promising approaches in water splitting for H2 and O2 evolution using solar energy directly and aroused considerable interests for research experts in materials science and chemistry. Photocatalysts accelerate the reaction by utilizing photon energy; thus, developing photocatalysts with high performance, high chemical stability, and low cost is a key issue. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) serves as a visible light-driven photocatalyst for solar energy conversion ever since its emergence as a photocatalyst for H2 evolution from water splitting.1 A tri-s-triazine-based polymeric structure was proposed for g-C3N4 synthesized by thermal condensation of small organic molecules.2 The g-C3N4 photocatalysts have found extensive application in H2 evolution from water splitting,3–11 pollutant degradation,12–14 volatile organic compound (VOC) decomposition,15,16 CO2 conversion,17,18 and sensing.19,20
It is the band structure of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts that influences the generation, recombination, and transfer of photoinduced electron/hole pairs. Scientists have paid much attention to tune their bandgap to enhance the photocatalytic performance. One category of strategies was adopted for engineering the band structures of catalysts to separate the electron/hole pairs effectively by doping non-metals such as B, O, and S,21–23 or metals such as K, Fe, Au, and Pt,24–26 forming heterojunctions with other semiconductors, such as CuO, CdS, ZnO, and TiO2.15,17,27 Other strategies were tried to improve the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4via fabrication of nanospheres, helical nanorods, porous nanofibers, and hollow nanowires with a soft or hard template27–36 to increase the specific surface area and thus improve photon absorption in the visible light region. Some researchers found that the photocatalytic activities were affected by precursors, the degree of polymerization, protonation, and crystallinity of g-C3N4 photocatalysts.9,37–43 Li et al. found that the condensed structure promoted the photocatalytic performance using cyanamide as the precursor.41 Martin et al. found that the hydrogen evolution rate was significantly enhanced with the increase in the degree of polymerization and the decrease in proton concentration using different precursors, but the crystallinity is not well correlated with the photocatalytic activities.9 Zou et al. found that the photocatalytic performance for H2 production was enhanced with the increase in degree of polymerization and the decrease in proton concentration and degree of crystallinity using different precursors, namely, urea, dicyandiamide and melamine.42 This inconsistency with regards to influencing factors may be due to the fact that different precursor molecules complicated the problem, which made the comparison complex. Therefore, we designed a research scheme to synthesize g-C3N4 photocatalysts with different morphologies from the same precursor, such as melamine and urea, to study the effect of structure, morphology, and polymerization on the photocatalytic performance for eliminating the precursor factor.
In this paper, a facile method is proposed to synthesize g-C3N4 microwires with enhanced photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution under solar irradiation. The crystallinity and the degree of polymerization were investigated for the photocatalysts in order to correlate the structure variation and the photocatalytic performance.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Synthesis of g-C3N4 microwires
All chemicals, purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, were of analytical grade and used without further purification. First, 2.5 g melamine was fully dissolved into 160 mL deionized water kept at 60 °C and then, 60 mL nitric acid (0.3 M concentration) was added dropwise. Following this, the solution was placed in an ice–water bath until white substances precipitated. The white precipitates were obtained by drying at 80 °C and transferred to a silica boat with a cover and heated at 500 °C for 2 h under nitrogen environment. The obtained g-C3N4 microwires were denoted as MW(III). The obtained white precipitates heated at 550°C for 2 h in an atmosphere of nitrogen were denoted as MW(II). When melamine was dissolved in ethylene glycol solution (ethylene glycol:water = 2:1) in the synthesis process of MW(III), the obtained catalyst was denoted as MW(I). Bulk g-C3N4 was prepared by thermally heating melamine powder (2.5 g) at 550 °C for 2 h under nitrogen atmosphere and used as a reference sample denoted as g-C3N4.
2.2 Characterization
The morphology was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSE-7800F, Jeol) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Libra 200FE, Zeiss). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded to characterize the crystalline structures of the g-C3N4 using a ShimadzuXRD7000 instrument with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR, Frontier) spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer spectroscopy instrument in KBr pellets. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to analyze the chemical state and composition using a VG ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.8 eV). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were recorded using a U-3310 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan) in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using an F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan) at an excitation wavelength of 273 nm using a 150 W Xe lamp as the excitation source. N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured using an ASAP-2010 apparatus. The total pore volume was estimated from the adsorbed amount of N2 at a relative pressure P/P0 of 0.995. Photocurrent measurements were conducted on an Autolab electrochemical workstation (Aut86039) in a standard three-electrode system using a platinum wire and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The working electrode was prepared by coating the catalysts on a 1.8 cm × 1.2 cm fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate. A 500 W Xe lamp with a light intensity of 113.8 mW cm−2 was used as the light source.
2.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen generation
The photocatalytic performance was analyzed using a full-spectrum photocatalyst performance evaluation system (Suncat Instruments Co., China). The reactor is made up of a quartz container with a highly transparent window of diameter 2.5 cm at the bottom. A 500 W Xe lamp (Zolix, Gloria-X500A) with adjustable intensity was used as the solar simulator with wavelength ranging from 380 to 780 nm. Its power distribution (Scheme S1†) is close to that of the standard solar spectrum.44–46 The reactor with a volume of 130 mL was kept at 20 °C, and the light intensity was 113.8 mW cm−2. Then, 10 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 30 mL water solution with 17 vol% triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial electron donor and 1 wt% Pt ion (H2PtCl6·H2O) as the cocatalyst. Prior to irradiation, the reactor was evacuated to high vacuum of up to 10−8 Torr to remove air and then filled with argon. The reaction suspension was stirred using a magnetic stirrer under irradiation. During the photocatalytic process, 1 mL of the gas sample was withdrawn from the reaction cell at 30 min intervals and the pressure was automatically compensated with argon. The amount of hydrogen evolved was measured by Shimadzu gas chromatography (GC-2018; molecular sieve TDX-01, TCD detector, Ar carrier gas) and calibrated using an Agilent 5 mL syringe. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of the photocatalysts was calculated according to the light absorption and H2 evolution rate as follows:  where S is the irradiation area, I is the light intensity, and Eλ is the photon energy with wavelength of λ.
3. Results and discussion
The morphologies of the g-C3N4 microwires were observed by SEM. Bulk g-C3N4 appeared as lumpy structures with some thick flakes with different sizes from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers, as shown in Fig. 1(a). As shown in Fig. 1(b)–(d), the samples of MW(I), MW(II), and MW(III) appeared as fiber-like structures with diameters of around 1–5 μm and lengths of several hundred micrometers. MW(III) appeared as round microwires with smooth surface, while MW(II) appeared as strings of nodular structures because of slight aggregations caused by higher calcification temperature compared with that of MW(III). MW(I) appeared as floccular wires of smaller diameter with rough surfaces as compared to MW(III) since melamine has lower solubility in ethylene glycol solution than in water. The amine group of melamine is highly reactive with nitrate ions and the protonated melamine assembled into fibrous structures.47 The high-resolution SEM (Fig. 1(d′)) and TEM images (Fig. 1(d′′)) show that there exist numerous porous defects on the MW(III) surfaces, and the g-C3N4 layers appear as cuspidal edges. These defects increase the surface area and the photocatalytic reaction sites.

The crystal structure of the bulk g-C3N4 nanosheets and the g-C3N4 microwires was examined using their powder XRD patterns. Fig. 2(a) shows that all samples display two distinct diffraction peaks located at 2θ of about 13.1° and 27.4°, which are in good accordance with the characteristic peaks of g-C3N4. The weak peak for (100) plane corresponds to the in-plane repeating motif. The strong peak for (002) crystal plane of g-C3N4 is attributed to the interlayer stacking of the conjugated aromatic systems in the layered structure.15,18 The inset in Fig. 2(a) shows that the intensity increases in following the order: g-C3N4 < MW(I) < MW(II) < MW(III). The XRD patterns imply that the crystallinity of MW(III) is the highest among all samples. The highest crystallinity indicated that MW(III) has the most regular repetitions between the graphitic layers. The stronger attraction between the g-C3N4 layers would result in shorter interplanar distance.23 The 2θ position for the (002) peak increased to 27.52° from 27.4° for MW(III) compared to g-C3N4, which results in shorter interplanar distance.18Fig. 2(b) shows the fitted peak and the amorphous background for all the samples. The diffraction peak (002) was fitted by employing a Gaussian function as the peak profile. The crystallinity index (χc) value was estimated as the ratio of the area of the crystal peak to the total integrated area of the crystal peak and the amorphous background.48 The overall crystallinity varied in the range of 52.24–68.28%. The FWHM decreases in the following order: g-C3N4 > MW(I) > MW(II) > MW(III). The FWHM of the (002) diffraction peak in MW(III) is the narrowest among all the four samples. The narrowed FWHM confirms the better crystallinity of the microwires. In conclusion, the XRD results indicate that MW(III) has the highest crystallinity and the smallest interplanar distance.

The chemical compositions and states of g-C3N4 microwires were investigated by XPS. Fig. 3 shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of C and N elements of bulk g-C3N4 and the microwires. The high-resolution C 1s XPS spectra of the three samples are shown in Fig. 3(a). The peaks centered at about 288.0 eV (C1) are typically attributed to the sp2 hybrid C atoms bonded to N-containing aromatic skeleton rings (N–CN) coordination. The peak at 285.5 eV (C2) is attributed to C–NH2 bonded in the triazine ring of the reactant intermediary product.10,18 The peak at 284.4 eV (C3) could be attributed to the graphitic carbon in the carbon nitride matrix.15 The N 1s spectra in Fig. 4(b) can be mainly decomposed to three typical peaks located at about 398.4 eV (N1), 399.7 eV (N2), and 400.8 eV (N3), which can be attributed to the sp2-hybridized aromatic N atoms bonded to carbon atoms (C–NC), sp3-hybridized N atoms of N(–C)3 and terminal amino functions (C–NHX), respectively.18,19 The C/N atomic ratio is 0.76 for bulk g-C3N4, which is close to the stoichiometric ratio. The C/N ratios are 0.80, 0.79, and 0.81 for MW(I), MW(II), and MW(III), respectively. These results demonstrated that the as-prepared microwires have a carbon-rich structure. Table 1 shows the different component ratios in the N 1s spectra for different samples, in which the percentage of sp3 bonded N(–C)3 increases and that for C–NHX decreases slightly. Graphitic carbon nitride is composed of a ‘melem’ unit connected to the adjacent inner ‘melem’ via N(–C)3 and the adjacent edge ‘melem’ via NH – bridging. With the increase in the degree of polymerization, the NH2 group in the inner bridge changes to N(–C)3. Thus, the remaining –NHX group percentage indicates the degree of polymerization. The decrease in the atomic percentage of the C–NHX component and the increase in the atomic percentage of the N(–C)3 component imply that the degree of polymerization increased. Elemental analysis was carried out by an elemental analyzer (Elementar, Vario EL cube). The hydrogen concentrations are 2.28, 2.06, 1.92, and 1.83 wt% for bulk g-C3N4, MW(I), MW(II) and MW(III), respectively. The elemental analysis provides results consistent with those of XPS. The degree of polymerization for all samples is in the order of g-C3N4 < MW(I) < MW(II) < MW(III).

The UV-vis absorbance spectra of bulk, MW(I), MW(II) and MW(III) g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 4(a). There is a sharp absorption edge for the pure g-C3N4 nanosheets at around 460 nm, which is indexed to the bandgap energy of about 2.7 eV, which is firmly associated with the photocatalytic property in visible light.18,19 Enhanced visible light absorption intensity is observed in the spectrum of microwire MW(III). The Kubelka–Munk plots in Fig. 4(b) show that the adsorption edge is 2.69 eV for all the samples. These results reveal that the bandgap remains unchanged for all the samples.
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded to investigate the recombination and separation of photoinduced charge carriers in bulk g-C3N4, and the g-C3N4 microwires at an excitation wavelength of 374 nm. The measured PL spectra, as shown in Fig. 4(c), showed that all of the samples exhibit a main emission peak appearing at about 440 nm, which is consistent with the reported value in the literature.16,17 The PL intensity decreases following the order: bulk g-C3N4 > MW(I) > MW(II) > MW(III). Compared to bulk g-C3N4, the microwires show weaker PL intensity, revealing lower recombination probability of the photoinduced electrons and holes, which could give rise to higher photocatalytic activity.17

Fig. 4(d) shows the adsorption–desorption isotherms of bulk g-C3N4 and the microwires. The specific surface areas are 13.4 m2 g−1, 19.5 m2 g−1, 26.9 m2 g−1 and 37.8 m2 g−1 for the bulk g-C3N4, MW(II), MW(I) and MW(III) samples. The MW(III) photocatalyst exhibits the largest specific surface area among all the samples.
Mott–Schottky measurements were conducted in the dark at a frequency of 500 and 800 Hz for the MW(III) photocatalyst. The positive slopes indicate that MW(III) is a n-type semiconductor with electrons as the majority carriers. The M-S analysis shows that the flat-band potential is −1.23 eV, which indicates that the conduction band of MW(III) is at −1.23 eV. The valence band is at 1.46 eV according to the experimental bandgap of 2.69 eV for MW(III), as shown in Fig. 4(b). Fig. 5(b) shows a schematic of the band structure of MW(III). Compared with titanium dioxide, the bandgap of MW(III) is narrower and the conduction band is more negative, which is responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.

The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of bulk g-C3N4 and the g-C3N4 microwires were recorded to understand the photocatalytic mechanism. The arc on the EIS Nyquist plot indicates the charge transfer resistance. Generally, a smaller arc radius implies a lower charge transfer resistance.21,24 As shown in Fig. 6(a), the Nyquist plots of all the g-C3N4 microwires show smaller arc radii, attributed to the reduced electric resistance and enhanced conductivity compared to those of bulk g-C3N4. In fact, the arc radius for MW(III) is the smallest among all the samples, which is associated with the highest efficiency of the charge separation.40–43 Moreover, this changing trend in the arc radius for g-C3N4 samples is consistent with the results obtained from the PL spectra.
 Fig. 6  EIS spectra (a) and transient photocurrent response (b) of all samples. 
The transient photocurrent responses of all samples are recorded in Fig. 6(b). The photocurrent shows a fast response to light irradiation with good reproducibility for each ON–OFF cycle. That showed a rapid and steady photocurrent response with reproducibility for each on–off cycle. The current density for MW(III) is about 3 times that observed for the bulk g-C3N4 sample, revealing the most effective separation and transition of photoinduced electron/hole pairs, which are consistent with PL spectra.
The photocatalytic activities of the bulk and three g-C3N4 microwire samples were evaluated by photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water/triethanolamine (TEOA) solution under solar irradiation (λ > 380 nm). In brief, 10 mg photocatalysts were dispersed in a solution containing 1 wt% Pt ion and 17 vol% TEOA. As shown in Fig. 7(a), about 4 mmol g−1 of H2 was generated for the MW(III) catalyst after 150 min of irradiation, which is 3.66 times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4. The stability for MW(I), MW(II), and MW(III) was tested under solar irradiation, as shown in Fig. 7(b)–(d). No significant difference was observed for four rounds under solar irradiation, indicating that these photocatalysts are very stable in the H2 evolution process. Table 2 presents the relationship between AQY and the crystallinity of g-C3N4 microwires. The hydrogen evolution rate (HER) and the AQY increase as the crystallinity increases. Considering XRD along with XPS results, we can deduce that HER improvement resulted from the higher degree of crystallinity and polymerization, which facilitate the transfer of photoinduced carrier charges.

The melamine-derived MW(III) photocatalyst is stable and has high apparent quantum yield with 1 wt% Pt cocatalyst compared with some reported g-C3N4 photocatalysts (Table S1†), even closing to the photocatalytic efficiency of some urea-derived g-C3N4 photocatalysts.5–9,43
Further experiments were carried out to study the effect of the crystallinity and the degree of polymerization on the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 synthesized from the urea precursor at 450 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C, and 600 °C, denoted as 450CN, 500CN, 550CN, and 600CN, respectively. Fig. 8 shows the XRD patterns of g-C3N4 obtained by calcifying urea at different temperatures. The spectra of all of these samples show two characteristic peaks, among which the strong peak at about 27.5 is indexed as the (002) plane, and the weak peak as the (100) plane. Careful analysis shows that the intensity for the (002) peak increases as the calcification temperature increases. The crystallinity follows the order 450CN < 500CN < 550CN < 600CN. Fig. 8(b) shows that the FWHM of peak (002) decreased as the calcification temperature increased, and the peak position moves to higher 2θ. As the calcification temperature increases, the crystallinity increases and the crystal becomes more compact.

Fig. 9 shows the XPS spectra of g-C3N4 synthesized from urea at different temperatures. The high resolution of C 1s spectrum is deconvoluted into three peaks at 284.4 eV, 285.5 eV, and 287.9 eV. The peak centered at about 287.9 eV (C1) is typically attributed to the coordination of sp2 hybrid C atoms bonded to N-containing aromatic skeleton rings (N–CN). The peak at 285.8 eV (C2) is attributed to C–NH2 bonded in the triazine ring of the reaction intermediate. Careful analysis showed that the peak for C–NH2 shifts to a higher binding energy from 285.1 eV (450CN) to 285.5 eV (600CN) gradually since more C–NH2 groups change to C–NH as the polymerization process progresses with the increase in calcifying temperature. The peak at 284.4 eV (C3) could be attributed to graphitic carbon in the carbon nitride matrix. The N 1s spectra in Fig. 4(b) can be mainly deconvulted to three typical peaks located at about 398.4 eV (N1), 399.7 eV (N2), and 400.8 eV (N3), which could be attributed to the sp2-hybridized aromatic N atoms bonded to carbon atoms (C–NC), sp3-hybridized N atoms of N(–C)3, and terminal amino functions (C–NHX), respectively. From the data listed in Table 3, we found that the atomic percentage of component C–NHX decreases as the calcification temperature increases, while that of N(–C)3 increases as the calcification temperature increases. Elemental analysis showed that the hydrogen concentrations are 2.21, 2.00, 1.58, and 1.20 wt% for 450CN, 500CN, 550CN, and 600CN, respectively. Elemental analysis and XPS produced consistent results. The XPS results indicate that the degree of polymerization improves as the calcification temperature increases.

Graphitic carbon nitride synthesized from urea at different temperatures was tested for hydrogen evolution in a aqueous sacrificial solution containing TEOA at room temperature and ambient environment. Fig. 10 shows the H2 evolution results of g-C3N4 by calcifying urea at 450 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C, and 600 °C. The urea-derived g-C3N4 sample exhibited superior hydrogen evolution rate at higher calcification temperatures. The XRD and XPS results indicated that the crystallinity and the degree of polymerization increased significantly with the increase in calcification temperature. The difference in the increased photocatalytic activity is due to the calcification temperature employed during sample preparation, which leads to higher level of polymerization and crystallinity at higher temperatures. Table 3 shows the relationship between the H2 evolution and the crystallinity of g-C3N4 derived from urea via calcification. H2 evolution rate increases with the increase in the crystallinity of g-C3N4 photocatalysts. By carefully comparing the data in Tables 2 and 4, it can be observed that the crystallinity varies at totally different ranges for g-C3N4 derived from melamine and urea. The urea-derived g-C3N4 exhibits lower crystallinity (29.32–36.20%) than the melamine-derived g-C3N4 (52.24–68.28%). However, the correlation between the H2 evolution and the crystallinity follows a similar trend in their respective ranges. In case of g-C3N4 prepared from different precursors (melamine, dicyandiamide, and urea), the urea-derived photocatalyst has the highest H2 generation, while its crystallinity is the lowest among all the three samples.9,42 Therefore, comparison of the crystallinity of g-C3N4 samples synthesized from different precursors may produce ambiguous results.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a structure-controlled g-C3N4 microwire photocatalyst was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The photocatalyst MW(III) exhibited highly efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution from water splitting under full solar radiation, with an apparent quantum yield of 8.83%. The optimized MW(III) photocatalyst produced approximately 16.88 μmol of hydrogen per hour from water, and it was very stable. MW(III) exhibited a linear profile of H2 production from water for 150 min under excitation using a 500 W Xe lamp. XRD and XPS results indicated that MW(III) has the highest crystallinity and degree of polymerization among all the samples. The correlation between the H2 evolution efficiency and the structure and composition showed that realization of significant improvement in photocatalytic activity requires good crystallinity and high degree of polymerization of g-C3N4.
