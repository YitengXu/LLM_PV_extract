    , Accepted 22nd June 2017First published on 22nd June 2017AbstractCarbon is inherently abundant in nature and relatively inexpensive, which can potentially reduce the manufacturing cost of solar cells. In recent years, carbon has been used as a hole transport layer or counter electrode in perovskite solar cells. Herein, we demonstrate that carbon can also be used as a charge transport layer capable of enhancing the energy conversion efficiency of a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx solar cell when carbon is combined with PCBM. Particularly, we have been able to deposit an ultra-flat carbon layer using an e-beam irradiation method, which exhibited much better conductivity than the competitive PCBM/C60 layer. In addition, quantitative analysis of interfacial charge dynamics shows that the quenching efficiency of PCBM/carbon is comparable to that of PCBM/C60 but better interface defect passivation and improved series and shunt resistances were observed when PCBM/carbon was employed. For the photovoltaic performance, the reference perovskite solar cell fabricated from the widely used PCBM/C60 has a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14% while the perovskite solar cell with PCBM/carbon has an increased PCE of 16%. Our results demonstrate the potential of the use of cost-effective carbon for perovskite solar cells, which could reduce production costs.
1. Introduction
In recent years, the hybrid halide perovskite material family has revolutionized the prospects of next-generation photovoltaic technologies,1–4 demonstrating a quantum jump to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 20% over the past few years. It is worth noting that such a high PCE for perovskite solar cells was achieved with a small active area (0.1–0.3 cm2) while the large active area (∼50.6 cm2) perovskite solar cell showed a record high PCE of 12.6%.5 The rapid development of perovskite solar cells was attributed to their excellent electrical and optical properties including long charge carrier diffusion length,6–8 high charge carrier mobility,9,10 high absorption coefficients,11,12 and unusual defect properties.13 In the early stage of development, perovskite solar cells used an n–i–p device structure employing an n-type TiO2 layer as the bottom electron transport layer.2,14,15 In this structure, a high temperature (>400 °C) sintering process is typically required to ensure high quality TiO2, which inevitably increases manufacturing costs and lacks compatibility with flexible substrates. In addition, p-type spiro-OMeTAD is generally used as a hole transport layer and suffers from poor crystallinity, low mobility and decomposition.16 Critically, the n–i–p planar structure is subject to a considerable current–voltage (J–V) hysteresis.17 Recently, in order to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells, interfacial engineering between the components of the perovskite solar cell layers has been actively studied.18–21 For instance, insertion of a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer layer19 or lithium-neutralized graphene oxide20 into perovskite solar cells increased the stability and PCE of the perovskite solar cells. In addition, MoS2 flakes were inserted between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD, which resulted in enhanced hole transport and stability of the device.21
Alternatively, inverted p–i–n device structures have been passionately pursued because of their negligible hysteresis, low temperature processing and device structure flexibility.17,22 In this case, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was used as a hole transport layer while fullerene derivatives such as C60, PCBM, graphene oxide doped PCBM, and ICBA were investigated as an electron transport layer (ETL).22–25 Among them, PCBM is widely used as an ETL due to its high electron accepting property and its role in trap passivation in the perovskite film.22,24 Particularly, the bilayer composed of PCBM/C60 has been highly pursued due to increased conductivity, trap passivation capability, and quenching efficiency.23,24,26 Recent studies revealed that shallow defects were passivated by PCBM while deep traps with a trap depth greater than 0.5 eV were passivated by C60.26 However, high-purity C60 is relatively expensive because it must be synthesized using raw chemical materials and a high temperature process.27,28 Alternatively, carbon is abundantly available in nature and relatively inexpensive, and can have great potential for replacing expensive C60 in perovskite solar cells. Recently, carbon has been used as a hole transport layer or as a counter electrode for perovskite solar cells.29 This is because the work function of carbon (∼5 eV)30 is well aligned with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of perovskite (∼5.4 eV). Particularly, the deep work function of carbon as an ETL, as shown in Fig. 1, will result in a small built-in voltage of the perovskite solar cell. However, when carbon is combined with a PCBM ETL, photogenerated electrons will be directed by the work function difference between PEDOT:PSS and PCBM.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of carbon as a new charge transport material for the perovskite solar cell, we were able to deposit ultra-flat carbon on top of PCBM using an electron beam irradiation method. We also compared the effectiveness of PCBM/carbon with PCBM/C60 for the photovoltaic performance of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (MAPbI3−xClx) perovskite solar cells. Remarkably, the power conversion efficiency of the PCBM/carbon based perovskite solar cell was raised to 16% from 14%, compared to the perovskite solar cell which was fabricated with the PCBM/C60 layer. The better performance was attributed to the reduction of interfacial defects and improved series and shunt resistance of the perovskite solar cells while the quenching efficiency of PCBM/carbon was comparable to that of PCBM/C60.
2. Experimental
2.1. Perovskite solar cell fabrication and characterization
Fluorine doped tin oxide coated (FTO) glasses (SnO2/F, ∼8 Ω sq−1, Aldrich) were used as the transparent electrode and substrate of the devices, which were etched using zinc powder (Zn, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, Alfa-Aesar) solution to form the desired pattern. The patterned FTO substrates were subsequently cleaned in ultrasonic baths (Branson 1500) containing mucasol (Sigma-Aldrich), de-ionized water, methanol (Alfa-Aesar), acetone (Alfa-Aesar) and 2-propanol (J.T.Baker), respectively (each for 10 minutes). Afterwards, the substrates were dried with nitrogen, followed by heat treatment at 120 °C for 20 mins to remove the last traces of any solvent. A hole transporting layer was deposited on the cleaned FTO substrate at 3000 rpm for 1 min using a PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083, HERAEUS) solution in 2-propanol (J.T.Baker) (1:3 ratio), which was annealed at 150 °C for 20 min. To form the active layer of perovskite, a precursor solution of MAPbI3−xClx was prepared by dissolving equimolar ratios of lead iodide (PbI2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) and methylamine hydrochloride (MACl, Sigma-Aldrich) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.8%) in a concentration of 11 wt%. The perovskite films were fabricated using a hot-casting technique in which the substrates were kept at 180 °C and the precursor solution at 70 °C. The solution was then immediately spin-coated on top of the hot PEDOT:PSS layer so that the substrate temperature was retained. Then, the devices were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box. PCBM, used as an ETL, was spun on top of the perovskite layer at 1250 rpm for 60 s using a solution of 2 wt% PCBM (Nano-C, 99.5%) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (Alfa-Aesar, 99%). C60 or carbon was deposited on top of the PCBM layer at a base pressure of <1 × 10−7 Torr. Particularly, C60 (Alfa Aesar, 99%) or graphite (Aldrich, 99.99%) was placed in a graphite crucible and irradiated by e-beam. The resultant thickness and morphologies were measured by SEM. Finally, 170 nm thick silver (Alfa-Aesar, 99.9%) as a cathode electrode was deposited at 4 angstroms per second under a pressure of 1 × 10−7 Torr using an electron beam (E-beam) evaporator. In this study, the reference perovskite solar cell was FTO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM/Ag. To study the effectiveness of the PCBM/carbon and PCBM/C60 layers for photovoltaic performance, two different perovskite solar cells of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM/C60 (∼10 nm)/Ag and FTO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM/carbon (∼10 nm)/Ag were fabricated, as shown in Fig. 1(a). All of the three devices have an active area of 10 mm2.
2.2. Optical characterization
Perovskite samples were prepared on glass substrates to attain optical characterization of steady-state and time-resolved PL. The cleaning steps of the glass substrates and the deposition procedure of the perovskite layer were the same as mentioned for the perovskite solar cells. To prevent degradation by air exposure, the samples were coated by a polymer, polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA, Sigma-Aldrich, Mw ∼ 120000) in chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) (10 mg ml−1), at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra were recorded using a spectrophotometer (Flurolog, Horiba Jobon Yvon) and a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system connected with a solid-state laser. For the PL measurement, an excitation wavelength of 450 nm was used and the emission spectra were measured from 600 nm to 850 nm. For the time-resolved PL (TRPL), a high-speed photomultiplier tube detector (FL-1073, Horriba scientific Inc.) was employed for photon counting with a repetition rate of 4 MHz and 450 nm excitation.
2.3. Hall, four point and SEM measurements
Surface and cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the perovskite film were collected by a Hitachi S-4700 field emission SEM (FESEM). Images were taken at different magnifications and accelerating voltages. A thin conductive layer of gold (Au) was coated on the film using a Hummer V Sputter Coater before scanning the surface and cross-section of the film. The sheet resistance of the perovskite film was measured using a Jandel RM3 four-point probe. In addition, an Ecopia HMS-5300 Hall effect measurement system was used to determine electrical properties such as sheet resistance, mobility, resistivity, Hall coefficient, and so on.
3. Results and discussion
One of the critical challenges is to achieve controlled deposition of the carbon layer on top of the soft perovskite film. PCBM can typically be coated on the perovskite film by spin-casting PCBM dissolved in dichlorobenzene23,24,26 while the C60 thin film can typically be deposited through thermal evaporation on top of the perovskite/PCBM layer.24,31,32 Currently there is a lack of systematic studies of the uniform deposition of carbon films on the perovskite layer while not disturbing the perovskite layer, thereby requiring a relatively low temperature deposition. Particularly, the precise control of the thickness of carbon is required for effective electron transport. Currently, several methods have been reported for the fabrication of thin-film carbon including ink printing,33 sputtering,34 and electron-beam irradiation methods.35,36 We report here a method for depositing high-purity carbon films using e-beam irradiation in which an electron beam is generated from a filament and steered to strike graphite rods or flakes. Due to the nature of the deposition and the use of a high-purity carbon source, this e-beam deposited carbon will be highly pure and easily mass-produced. This approach allows one to precisely control the thickness of the carbon layer by simply controlling the e-beam exposure time. Graphite (Aldrich) placed in a graphite e-beam crucible was irradiated by e-beam in a high vacuum of ∼10−7 Torr at room temperature. Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) images of a 50 nm thick carbon film on a glass slide, showing an exceedingly flat surface. At the higher magnification in Fig. 2b, the carbon film had a densely-packed morphology of an exceedingly flat surface of the carbon film composed of small grains with a grain size of ∼30 nm. Also, a 50 nm thick carbon film was deposited on top of a MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM layer and showed a sharp interface, as shown in Fig. 2(c). A four-point probe and Hall effect measurements were used to measure the sheet resistance and mobility of the carbon films. The Hall effect measurement of the carbon film showed a mobility of ∼0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is a little lower than the reported mobility of C60 (1.6 cm2 V−1 s−1) but is better than that of PCBM (6.1 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1).23 We also deposited an ultrathin ∼10 nm thick carbon film whose thickness is typically used for a charge transport layer. Our measurement indicates that the conductivity of the ∼10 nm thick carbon film was σ = 4.24 ± 0.68 S cm−1, which is much better than the reported conductivities of C60 (2.4 × 10−3 S cm−1) and PCBM (3.2 × 10−4 S cm−1).23

Fig. 3 shows the morphologies of the perovskite films coated with charge transport layers of PCBM, PCBM/C60 and PCBM/carbon. In this regard, the perovskite films were fabricated using a hot-casting technique.37,38 In this case, the FTO/glass slide was pre-heated to 180 °C while the preheated perovskite solution at 70 °C was spin-cast. Typically, a hot-casting technique results in pinhole-free morphologies, as shown in Fig. 3(a). However, higher magnification of the perovskite films shows that the perovskite morphologies were packed with nanoscale grains in Fig. 3(b). The deposition of the charge transport layers slightly modified the surface morphologies. Particularly, the spin-casting of PCBM on the perovskite film resulted in a smoother surface with relatively larger grains, as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d). The PCBM/C60 layer in Fig. 3(e) and (f) was covered by densely packed small grains which might be attributed to the fact that C60 lacks bulky side-chains, leading to densely packed grains. Particularly, the morphology of the perovskite film with PCBM/carbon in Fig. 3(g) and (h) is similar to that of the perovskite/PCBM layer.

Fig. 4 shows the current–voltage characteristics of the p–i–n perovskite solar cells composed of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM, PCBM/C60 or PCBM/carbon/Ag. Their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The perovskite solar cell with PCBM showed an energy conversion efficiency of 10.6%. One of the reasons for the lower PCE of the reference solar cell with the PCBM layer might be the lack of a thermal annealing process for the MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM layer.24 It is noted that the optimal thermal processes of MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM led to the diffusion of PCBM, which subsequently passivates the defects on the perovskite surfaces and at the grain boundaries.24 In this study, we did not perform thermal annealing to simplify the fabrication process and clearly show the effect of an additional carbon layer. When PCBM/C60 was used, the efficiency of the perovskite solar cell with PCBM/C60 improved to ∼14% which was due to the improved JSC (22.47 mA cm−2), FF (0.64) and higher VOC (0.97 V). When PCBM/carbon was used, a much higher efficiency of ∼16% was obtained. This is attributed to a further improved JSC (23.69 mA cm−2) and FF (0.71) while the VOC (0.96 V) value is slightly lower than that (0.97 V) of the perovskite solar cell with PCBM/C60. It is worth noting that the use of PCBM/carbon led to an improvement of the fill factor which is very sensitive to the interfacial charge transfer. Therefore, the improved FF of the perovskite solar cell with PCBM/carbon infers that PCBM/carbon might lead to a better interface between the perovskite and PCBM/carbon layer.

To further investigate the perovskite solar cells, the single-diode mode was used to extract the characteristics of the perovskite solar cells that are related to the current I and the voltage V, given by the implicit formula39 (1)where I0 is the saturation current, Iph the photocurrent, Rs the series resistance, Rsh the shunt resistance, n the ideality factor, and q the electron charge. The quantity VT = kBT/q is the thermal voltage of the solar cell where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the cell temperature. The extracted diode parameters are listed in Table 1. As shown, we note the variations of series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) of the perovskite solar cells by applying the different charge transport layers. When the PCBM/C60 layer was applied to the perovskite film, Rs slightly dropped when compared with the perovskite solar cell fabricated with PCBM. However, a drastic reduction of Rs was observed when PCBM/carbon was used as an electron extraction layer, which was attributed to the highly conductive carbon layer. We also observed a much lower reverse saturation current in the perovskite solar cell with PCBM/carbon than those in the perovskite solar cells fabricated with PCBM only and PCBM/C60. Remarkably, I0 dropped from mid 10−8 mA to 1.5 × 10−8 mA when PCBM was replaced with PCBM/C60. When PCBM/carbon was used, I0 further dropped by a factor of 10 to low 10−9 mA. It is well known that the reverse bias saturation current I0 is related to the loss of photogenerated charge carriers at the defects, which reflects the quality and defect states of the interfaces.40
To evaluate the trap density of the perovskite films, the excitation-dependent PL measurements were utilized in which the initial photogenerated charge carrier density n(0) is given by the equation41,42 (2)where IPL is the integrated PL intensity, k is a constant for a given sample, τ0 is the PL lifetime, Nit is the initial unfilled trap state density and ai is the product of the trap cross section and the carrier velocity. A quantitative analysis of experimental data using eqn (2) will yield bulk trap densities (NBt) of the perovskite film and interface, or surface trap densities (NSt) of the perovskite film with or without the ETL. The PL measurements were carried out with a 450 nm laser source to excite samples that were coated with a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) layer to avoid degradation induced by air exposure.6 Particularly, the PL excitation densities were varied to yield photogenerated carriers from low 1014 cm−3 to 1017 cm−3. Fig. 5(a) shows the photogenerated charge carriers as a function of the normalized PL intensity which was fitted to eqn (2) and shown with solid lines. The extracted interface and bulk trap densities are listed in Table 2. Note that the interface trap density was somewhat reduced, depending upon the charge transfer layer of PCBM, PCBM/C60 and PCBM/carbon. As expected, the perovskite film contained a significant amount of surface trap with a value of 5.17 × 1017 cm−3, which is in good agreement with previously reported values.41–43 When PCBM is applied on the perovskite film, the interfacial trap density was decreased to 2.40 × 1017 cm−3. The further reduction of the interface trap density to 1.55 × 1017 cm−3 and 1.07 × 1017 cm−3 was observed for perovskite/PCBM/C60 and perovskite/PCBM/carbon, respectively. Fig. 5(b) shows the close relationship between interface defects and the reverse saturation current of the perovskite solar cells. This suggests that the perovskite/PCBM/carbon layer effectively passivated the interface defects of the perovskite film, which might lead to a reduced saturation current of the perovskite solar cells.

To further understand the perovskite/ETL interface and interfacial charge extraction, the lifetime decays of the perovskite films with the quenching layers were evaluated using a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system, as shown in Fig. 5(c). In this regard, the samples were excited with a 450 nm pulsed diode laser (FWHM ≈ 120 ps) at a repetition rate of 4 MHz and an excitation intensity of 107 mW cm−2. The exponential decays were fitted with bi-exponential decay functions,23 containing a fast decay (τ1) and slow decay (τ2). It should be noted that a slow decay is due to radiative recombination, whereas a fast decay occurs due to defects or quenchers. Therefore, the quenching efficiency of the PCBM, PCBM/C60 and PCBM/carbon layers can be evaluated by comparing the fast decay. As expected, for the perovskite film without electron transport quenching layers, the fast and slow decay lifetimes were 3.63 ns and 28.5 ns, as listed in Table 3. This suggests that radiative recombination dominates in the perovskite film when there is no electron transport quenching layer. As expected, the presence of the quenching ETL on the perovskite film significantly reduced the fast decay component of the perovskite films. Particularly, the fast decay lifetimes were 0.94 ns, 0.82 ns and 1.19 ns with corresponding slow decay lifetimes of 5.63 ns, 5.32 ns and 5.93 ns for perovskite/PCBM, perovskite/PCBM/C60 and perovskite/PCBM/carbon, respectively. Based on the results of lifetime decay, all the electron transport quenching layers of PCBM, PCBM/C60 and PCBM/carbon were comparable while the PCBM/C60 showed slightly better quenching efficiency. Notably, the different lifetime decays for PCBM, PCBM/C60 and PCBM/carbon infer the modification of the perovskite/PCBM interfacial layer.

However, the different interfacial defects and quenching efficiency of PCBM, PCBM/C60 and PCBM/carbon are rather unexpected because the PCBMs in the PCBM/C60 and PCBM/carbon layers were in direct contact with the perovskite layer, which should result in similar results. Particularly, we found that the bulk trap densities for all the samples were almost identical. It is well known that thermal treatment facilitates the diffusion of PCBM and C60 into perovskite, which subsequently passivates bulk defects.24,26 For this study, no thermal treatment of PCBM, PCBM/C60 or PCBM/carbon was carried out for all samples before depositing the Ag metal electrode. This suggests that the extensive diffusion of PCBM, C60 and carbon did not occur, which does not affect the bulk trap densities. We think that the interfacial modification occurred during or/and after the deposition of C60 and carbon on the PCBM layer. Some insights can come from the PCBM surface morphologies containing nanoscale grains with pinholes, as shown in the SEM image in Fig. 3(d). We believe that C60 and carbon diffuse through the PCBM grain boundaries or/and pinholes and subsequently modify the perovskite/PCBM interface, as illustrated in Fig. 5(d). Since the atomic size of carbon is much smaller than C60, the diffusion process can be facilitated much more easily than with C60. As described earlier, the direct contact of carbon on the perovskite will inevitably reduce the built-in voltage of the perovskite solar cells due to the work function of carbon. Indeed, we observed the slightly reduced VOC of the perovskite solar cells fabricated with PCBM/carbon when compared with the perovskite solar cell with PCBM/C60, as shown in Table 1. However, the positive aspects of the interfacial modification with carbon would be the enhanced conductivity and reduction of the inverse saturation current that were evidenced by the power-dependent defect calculation and J–V curve analysis. Such results were the improved JSC and FF of the perovskite solar cells with PCBM/carbon.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated a new PCBM/carbon charge transport layer for perovskite solar cells. The ultra-flat carbon layer was successfully deposited using an e-beam irradiation technique on the soft perovskite/PCBM layer. The deposited carbon film showed higher conductivity than PCBM and C60 by a few orders of magnitude. In addition, it is found that combined PCBM/carbon reduced the interfacial defects and improved the shunt and series resistances of the perovskite solar cells. Our results demonstrate the potential of the use of cost-effective carbon for perovskite solar cells, which could reduce production costs.
