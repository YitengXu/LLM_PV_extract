    , Accepted 1st September 2020First published on 15th September 2020AbstractIn this paper, a nanocomposite was constructed to achieve improved photodynamic therapy (PDT) via disrupting the redox balance in cancer cells. Firstly, Sb2Se3 nanorods were synthesized as a new photosensitizer, displaying high photothermal conversion efficiency (45.2%) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production due to the narrow band gap (1.1 eV) and a good NIR response. Moreover, the mechanism was investigated, demonstrating that dissolved O2 and photoinduced electrons manipulated ROS generation. Then, mesoporous silica was coated outside to improve the biocompatibility and to supply abundant space for the anticancer drug (doxorubicin, DOX). The sensitive Se–Se linker was grafted outside via a silane coupling reaction to block DOX molecules in the mesopores. As we know, the Se–Se group is sensitive to GSH, which can induce Se–Se linker bond breakage and targeted drug release due to the high expression of GSH in tumor cells. What is more, the consumption of intracellular GSH can also disrupt the redox balance in cancer cells, which would promote the PDT efficiency. The high-Z element of Sb possesses a high X-ray attenuation coefficient, giving the composite high contrast in CT imaging. This is associated with thermal imaging and multi-therapy (PDT/PTT/chemotherapy) to reveal the potential application to cancer treatment.
Introduction
Tumor has become one of the serious threats to human health. At present, the traditional treatment, such as: surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, suffers from the low curative effect and many side effects. The emerging photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted more and more attention in anticancer treatment due to its noninvasive, high spatial accuracy, controllability, etc. In a PDT process, the photosensitizer (PS) was stimulated by a particular type of light to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as: H2O2, ˙OH, and O2−, causing the irreversible damage to tumor cells.1–3 Currently, besides traditional organic PSs (porphyrins and their derivatives),4–7 some carbon materials and inorganic semiconductor materials have also been utilized as PS in PDT. Because of the high biosafety and deep tissue penetration capacity of near-infrared (NIR) light, NIR-triggered PDT has become a research hotspot. It is known that the NIR absorption capacity of carbon is dependent on their extent of conjugation, which cannot be adjustable easily. And a similar problem can also be found with organic PSs.8–12 The low NIR harvest is combined with a tedious synthetic/separation process and the low stability further inhibits their use in PDT.
As we know, the light absorption of inorganic semiconductor material is determined by its band gap. With adjustable morphologies and properties, the various inorganic semiconductor materials also exhibit a great potential application in the field. At first, ZnO required UV light to excite them.13–15 Therefore, narrow band gap semiconductors were investigated subsequently to reveal the novel performance on PDT, such as FeS2,16 WS2,17 WSe2,18 and Co3S4.19 Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) is a typical layered semiconductor with an orthorhombic crystal structure, exhibiting a high thermoelectric power and good photovoltaic properties.20–22 Owing to the narrow band gap (1.1–1.3 eV), it can extend light harvesting over the NIR region and has been widely used as light sensitizer in solar cells and photodetectors.23,24 It is believed that Sb2Se3 can also be considered as NIR-PSs for PDT, while there is no relative report about this.
In addition, owing to the altered metabolism in cancer cells, intracellular oxidative stress, derived from the reactive oxygen species (ROS), has been found at a higher concentration than that in normal cells. To maintain the balance of redox homeostasis for cell survival, cancer cells have also developed an elevated level of antioxidants, such as: enzyme (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase) and reluctant (glutathione, GSH).25–28 When the additional ROS were introduced by PSs, the intracellular antioxidants would resist the incoming ROS to weaken the PDT efficiency. Therefore, the disruption of intracellular redox homeostasis also benefits the high performance in cancer treatment.
Here, we want to integrate PTT/PDT/chemotherapy and CT imaging into one nanoplatform to disrupt the intracellular redox-balance and to further promote PDT (Scheme 1). Firstly, the Sb2Se3 nanorod, which was synthesized as a new PS, was coated with mesoporous silica to synthesize Sb2Se3@mSiO2. The mesoporous silica shell not only supplies plenty of space to accommodate the anticancer drug (Doxorubicin, DOX), but also improves the biocompatibility. And then the sensitive Se–Se linker was grafted outside by a silane coupling reaction to block the DOX molecule in the mesopore. As is well-known, the GSH concentration in tumor cells (2–10 mM) is higher than that in normal cells (0.002 mM), and the Se–Se group is cleavable to GSH. Therefore, the graft of Se–Se linker outside the nanocomposite can introduce two significant factors. 1. The GSH-sensitive drug release and target chemotherapy for tumor cells can be obtained. 2. The consumption of intracellular GSH can also disturb the redox homeostasis to promote PDT efficiency. Besides, the NIR-triggered ROS generation and the hyperpyrexia of Sb2Se3 were also surveyed. Dual-imaging (CT/photothermal) and multi-therapy (PTT/PDT/DOX) make the nanoplatform have potential applications in anticancer therapy.

Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1A and B, the synthetic Sb2Se3 reveals uniform nanorods of length 100–200 nm and width 50 nm. The HRTEM image displays an obvious lattice spacing of 0.828 and 0.287 nm, ascribing to the (101) and (212) planes of Sb2Se3 (PDF-75-1462) (Fig. 1C). And the Fourier Transform of the HRTEM image is in exact accordance with the SAED image as shown in Fig. 1D, which further confirms the single crystal structure of Sb2Se3 nanorods. Based on previous reports, rod-shaped nanoparticles would make a turbulent flow pattern of blood in vessels to provide more opportunities to exploit the gaps in the vascular wall.29 In order to affirm the component and valence state for Sb2Se3, XPS was used, as shown in Fig. 1E and F. The 3d orbit of the Sb element is divided into 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 energy levels. The peaks at the positions of 528.8 and 538 eV can be ascribed to Sb3+ and two relatively small shoulder peaks at 531.1 and 539.9 eV can be attributed to the oxidation of Sb2Se3. From Fig. 1F, the peak at 53.6 eV belongs to Se2+. Moreover, the large-angle XRD pattern exhibits the typical diffraction peaks of Sb2Se3 (PDF-75-1462) that is also agreed with the TEM and XPS as shown in Fig. 1. After the modification with mSiO2, the surface of nanorod was covered with a transparent layer, and a large number of mesopores could be seen in the mSiO2 shell, as shown in Fig. 1G and H. From Fig. 1I, the diffraction peaks at 16.8°, 27.3°, 28.1°, 31.1°, 32.2°, and 45.5° can be ascribed to the (201), (302), (112), (212), (013), and (020) diffractions of Sb2Se3 (PDF-75-1462) which is consistent with the TEM and XPS data shown in Fig. 1C and D. However, there is no diffraction peak of the SiO2 shell due to the amorphous structure of the SiO2 framework. And the Low-angle XRD pattern also displays a diffraction at about 2θ = 1.8 (Fig. 1J), ascribed to the mesoporous structure. However, the intensity of diffraction is not strong enough, suggesting a weak degree of order for the mesoporous structure. In addition, all the composites reveal a hollow structure. In fact, the as-synthesized Sb2Se3@mSiO2 (SM) does not possess the hollow structure, as shown in Fig. S1A.† After the removal of surfactant CTAB under reflux with ammonium nitrate, which also plays a role as an ion-exchange agent, the nanorods tend to hollow (Fig. S1B†). However, after two reflux treatments, the mesoporous silica shell disappears, leaving the single Sb2Se3 nanorod (Fig. S1C†). It is believed that ammonium nitrate is not only the ion-exchange agent, but also an etchant to induce the hollow structure of SM. From Fig. 1K, the HAADF-STEM image further reveals a hollow structure, and the corresponding EDX images show that the Sb and Se elements are located within the core, with Si and O elements surrounding the outside.

The absorption spectra of sample suspensions are shown in Fig. 2A; the pure Sb2Se3 nanorod possesses good adsorption in the whole spectrum, especially in the NIR region. After the coating of the mSiO2 shell, the absorption decrease slightly owing to the light-scattering effect of the silica layer.30 Considering the novel NIR adsorption, the temperature increment curves of the Sb2Se3 and SM suspensions were collected as revealed in Fig. 2B. When NIR light (808 nm) is used, both samples exhibit a rapid temperature elevation. After irradiation for 10 min, the temperature increment for Sb2Se3 can reach 26.6 °C, while that for SM is just 21.6 °C due to the negligible photothermal property of the SiO2 shell. From Fig. 2C, with an increase in concentration of the SM dispersion, the absorption at 808 nm also increases linearly so that its photothermal behavior is directly proportional to the sample concentration (Fig. 2D). As the concentration of SM increases to 200 μg mL−1, the temperature of the dispersion increases by 30.4 °C under NIR irradiation for 10 min. Under the same conditions, the temperature of pure water increases by just 4 °C, further proving the excellent photothermal efficiency derived from sample. And the visualized infrared thermal images further confirm the above investigations (Fig. 2E). Besides, the photothermal behavior is also linearly related to the irradiation intensities, as shown in Fig. S2.† When the laser intensity is amplified to 2 W cm−2, the solution can rise 35.5 °C in 10 min at a concentration of 100 μg mL−1. And the photothermal stability of the sample SM was also surveyed as presented in Fig. 2F. After 4 sequences of on–off illumination, the photothermal property of the nanocomposite still remained, attributed to the particular structural stability of SM before and after NIR irradiation (Fig. S3†). And the photothermal conversion efficiency of SM was also calculated to be 41% (Fig. S4†). In view of the above investigation, the adjustable (concentration/time/intensity dependent) performance, great photothermal conversion efficiency and high stability make SM a potential PTT agent.

(D) Photothermal heating curves and (E) corresponding infrared thermal images of SM dispersions with different concentrations under NIR irradiation. (F) Photothermal recycling curve of SM. An 808 nm laser (0.75 W cm−2) was used for NIR irradiation. 
In addition, the possibility of ROS production under NIR illumination was also surveyed. Here, dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was used as the ROS indicator, which can be oxidized into 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) with green fluorescence and the amount of ROS generation can be assessed by the intensity of the DCF fluorescence. Fig. 3A reveals the DCF fluorescence at different illumination times. Prolonging the irradiation time, the DCF fluorescence increases obviously, suggesting the irradiation-triggered ROS generation. However, without NIR, negligible fluorescence can be detected. It is believed that the ROS generation relies on the association of nanocomposite and NIR. The controllable and good performance also makes SM a potential PDT agent.

To further recognize the possible ROS species, isopropanol (IPA) and p-benzoquinone (PBQ) were adopted as ˙OH and O2− radical scavengers, respectively. From Fig. 3B, the added IPA can induce a remarkable attenuation of the emission, while there is negligible decay with PBQ addition, demonstrating that the dominated ROS specie is ˙OH instead of ˙O2−. Moreover, ESR spectra were also collected to provide visualized evidence of ROS production by using DMPO as a detector. As displayed in Fig. 3C, the four typical signals (aH = aHβ = 14.9 G) with the peak magnitudes of 1:2:2:1 are ascribed to the addition product of DMPO and ˙OH (DMPO-OH). In dark conditions, no ESR peak can be detected. Furthermore, TEMP, a typical 1O2 indicator, was also adopted and revealed a negligible signal, manifesting little 1O2 generation. In view of the above characterization, it is affirmed that ˙OH is the main reactive substance formed in the system.
To elucidate the formation mechanism of ˙OH production for the semiconductor PDT agent, the energy band structure was investigated. Firstly, the UV-Vis spectrum of Sb2Se3 was collected and the corresponding (Ahν)2–hν curve shows a band gap of about 1.1 eV (Fig. S5A†). Therefore, NIR light (808 nm) can excite the electron transport from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of Sb2Se3. The VB value was acquired as VB-XPS was 0.53 eV vs. the Fermi level, as revealed in Fig. S5B.† The flat band potential (Efb), which is detected from the Mott–Schottky curve, is often used to evaluate the Fermi level. From Fig. S5C,† the Efb as well as the Fermi level is −0.07 V. Finally, the VB and CB levels of the Sb2Se3 nanorods can be estimated to be 0.46 and −0.64 eV, respectively. When 808 nm light was used, it induced a hole–electron separation, making the electron enter the CB and the hole remain in the VB. Owing to enough potential in comparison with EO2/HO2˙ = −0.13 eV, the photo-excited electrons in the CB (−0.64 eV) would catch the dissolved-oxygen and H+ to form HO2−, which is not stable and finally converts into ˙OH.31 To further verify the deduction, methanol (MeOH, hole radical scavenger) was also added to reveal the improved ROS generation. Based on the above investigation, the photo-excited hole (ECB = 0.46 eV) is insufficient to oxide H2O to produce ˙OH (EH2O/˙OH = 2.7 eV). Therefore, the addition of methanol can capture the hole and make the gathering of photo-induced electrons into the CB to promote the generation of ROS instead (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the O2 deficiency also was investigated by a N2-flowing treatment, exhibiting the declined ROS generation distinctly. In view of Fig. 3B and C, it is believed that the dissolved O2 and the photo-excited electrons determine the ROS production in semiconductor PS.
Mesoporous silica was introduced to supply abundant space for guest molecules, such as anticancer drugs. In this paper, Doxorubicin (Dox) was used as the drug model and was stored into the mesopore (Sb2Se3@mSiO2-Dox, SMD). And the FT-IR spectrum was collected to survey the modification and drug assembly. From Fig. S6A,† the obvious band at 1077 cm−1 is attributed to Si–O vibration of all the samples, and the emerging peak at 720 cm−1 confirms the Se–Se bond of SMDS. Moreover, the new peak at 1465 cm−1 is owing to the CC stretching vibration (benzene framework) of Dox, also testified by the typical absorption of Dox at 478 nm in the UV-Vis spectrum (Fig. S6B†). Moreover, after the –Se–Se– linker modification, the Zeta potential also increased from −21.1 ± 1.6 (SM) to −9.9 ± 0.8 eV (SMS) owing to the decreased surface Si–OH with negative charges (Fig. S6C†).
The sensitive-release performance was investigated as displayed in Fig. 4. Firstly, the effect of the Se–Se chain amount on Dox release was surveyed. With different Se–Se linker modifications, SMDS-1, SMDS-2 and SMDS-3 were prepared and immersed in pH 5.0 media with/without 10 mM GSH. From Fig. 4A, in the absence of GSH, little Dox leaks out; even after 48 h the release amount was just 17.8, 14.0, and 11.3% for SMDS-1, SMDS-2, and SMDS-3, respectively. However, the addition of GSH can improve the release obviously. It takes 4 h to reach 43.6, 37.6, and 33.2% and that can further increase to 87.4, 77.9, and 62% for SMDS-1, SMDS-2 and SMDS-3, respectively after 48 h. In view of Fig. 4A, the GSH-sensitive release can be attributed to the “–Se–Se– gate”, which is a typical sensitive-bond to some reducing agents, including GSH. This would induce the rupture of the Se–Se bond to make the “gate” open and therefore drug release. Otherwise, the “–Se–Se– gate” still blocks the mesopore of mSiO2 shell to seal the Dox molecules. In order to prove that GSH can be successfully consumed by SMDSP, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) was adopted to detect the concentration changes of GSH. With the increase of Se–Se linker concentrations, the yellow color derived from the reaction between GSH and DTNB gradually paled and the corresponding absorbance at 412 nm also decreased, implying the consumption of GSH by the Se–Se linker as shown in Fig. S7.† In addition, the GSH-triggered bond breaking is further confirmed by the attenuated Se–Se bond at 720 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectrum (Fig. S6A†) and the declined zeta-potential of SMS (−14.4 ± 1.5 eV) after being treated by GSH, which can reduce the Se–Se bond to form –SeH with a negative charge (Fig. S6C†).32,33 Besides, the release performances of SMD (without the “–Se–Se– gate”) were also surveyed. Fig. S6D† exhibits the fast Dox release to be 78.6 (with GSH) and 80.5% (without GSH) after 24 h, and the negligible distinction of the release behavior further verifies that the novel sensitive-release can be ascribed to the “–Se–Se– gate”.

To further study the release kinetics, all the release data were treated by the Higuchi model, which is always adopted to describe the process of guest-molecule release from water-insoluble porous carriers.34,35 The diffusion equation is as follows.Q = kt1/2where Q is the amount of released drug, t is the release time and k is the diffusion coefficient.
From Fig. 4B, without GSH, all the release amounts display a clear linear relationship to t1/2, implying a one-step diffusion-controlled process that is controlled by the gap of the “–Se–Se– gate”. After the addition of GSH, the release process can be subdivided into a two-step diffusion process because of the two segments of linearity before and after 12 h. After the addition of GSH, the “–Se–Se– gate” should be opened to induce drug release. With the lowest Se–Se linker coating, SMDS-1 reveals the highest diffusion coefficient in the first 12 h (19.92) followed by SMDS-2 (17.21) and SMDS-3 (14.98), as shown in Table S1,† because the thin “–Se–Se– gate” can be broken down very quickly, making the Dox leak out more freely. After 12 h, the diffusion coefficients of the samples decline and tend to become closer to each other. Therefore, the first-step release performance can be ascribed to the bond broking triggered by GSH, inducing plenty of Dox diffusion outside. After the gate opening, the release behavior is just regulated by the mesoporous structure in the second-step release process. In addition, the effect of GSH on the drug release was also surveyed, as shown in Fig. 4C. By varying the GSH concentration from 5 mM to 10 and 20 mM, the release amount also increased from 62.5% to 77.9 and 88.4%, because sufficient GSH can ensure most of the Se–Se bonds are broken and the drug releases more freely. On account of the photothermal effect of the Sb2Se3 core, the drug release under NIR illumination also was researched. From Fig. 4D, when NIR was used, the release also improved from 77.9 (without NIR irradiation) to 88.1% after 48 h (with an accumulative time of NIR irradiation of 7 × 10 min), owing to the hyperpyrexia derived from the photothermal effect. This can improve the molecular thermal motion to accelerate the diffusion of drug molecules. Based on the above investigation, the nanocomposites exhibit a GSH triggered drug release that is significant for the cancer target-therapy because of the higher expression of GSH in cancer cells than that in normal cells. And the release kinetics can also be adjusted by the amount of “–Se–Se– gate” and the NIR irradiation.
To further make sure the dispersion stability and biocompatibility, these composites were modified with PEG (Sb2Se3@mSiO2-DOX-Se-Se-PEG, SMDSP) (Fig. S8†). Then, the uptake and the intracellular drug release were surveyed by using HepG2 as the model cell. After they were incubated with SMDSP for 0.5 h, some red fluorescence derived from Dox can be found in the cells, indicating the fast uptake by HepG2 cells. With an increase of culture time, the gradually augmented red fluorescence illuminates the cytoplasm, verifying the GSH enzyme-sensitive Dox release. Further prolonging the culture time to 3 h and introducing the NIR illumination, more and more Dox release can be found to gather into the nuclei owing to the photothermal effect, which can further improve Dox release (Fig. 5A). The intracellular release behaviors are consistent with the above data, as shown in Fig. 4A. In addition, the intracellular ROS generation was also detected by adopting DCFH-DA as an indicator. From Fig. 5B, when HepG2 cells are co-cultured with SMP, an obvious green DCF fluorescence appeared after NIR irradiation, testifying the intracellular ROS production. After the graft of “–Se–Se– gate”, the green fluorescence was further enhanced for SMSP. This is because the high concentration of GSH in cancer cells can be taken away by the Se–Se bond to disturb the intracellular redox equilibrium that benefits the amplification of intracellular oxidative stress. Therefore, SMSP would be considered as the enhanced PDT agent.

Blue fluorescence: DAPI; and red fluorescence: DOX. (B) Bright field and fluorescence images of DCFH-DA-stained HepG2 cells incubated with SMP and SMSP with/without NIR irradiation. 
In order to visualize the cytotoxicity derived from PTT and PDT intuitively, calcein-AM and PI were used to label the living (green fluorescence) and dead cells (red fluorescence). Firstly, HepG2 cells were cultured with different concentrations of SMSP (0–100 μg mL−1), and later they were illuminated by NIR laser (0–1 W cm−2) for 20 min. And the corresponding fluorescence images were collected as, shown in Fig. 6A. The increment of laser intensity or sample concentration can weaken the green fluorescence and brighten the red fluorescence simultaneously, suggesting the prominent cytotoxicity derived from the synergetic PTT and PDT. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity was quantitatively evaluated by a MTT assay. As exhibited in Fig. 6B, the SMSP nanocarrier reveals a novel biocompatibility and hypotoxicity. Even at a high concentration (200 μg mL−1), they maintained a 91.7 ± 2.8% (HepG2) and 92.1 ± 2.1% (BEAS-2B) viability. From Fig. 6C, the cell viabilities decline to 33.6 ± 3.2% and 26.0 ± 4.6% for SMP + NIR and SMSP + NIR derived from the NIR-triggered PDT and PTT. And the higher cytotoxicity of SMSP + NIR is ascribed to the consumption of intracellular GSH by the “–Se–Se– gate” to disturb the intracellular redox balance by inhibiting the intracellular reducibility. That is conducive to the improvement of PDT efficacy. Beside the cancer cells, the normal cells also revealed similar results, showing the decreased cell viability of SMSP + NIR (32.0 ± 4.2%) to that of SMP + NIR (33.9 ± 3.2%) (Fig. 6D). After Dox loading, chemotherapy was also introduced. As present in Fig. 6E, after being incubated with SMDSP for 12 h, the cell viability decreased to 90.4 ± 3.8% (BEAS-2B cell) and 84.0 ± 2.8% (HepG2 cell), and the cytotoxicity is derived from the intracellular Dox release. The high expression of GSH in HepG2 (liver tumor cells) can promote the open of “–Se–Se– gate” to make the faster Dox release and the lower survival of HepG2 cells. The synergetic effect of chemotherapy, PTT, and PDT further lowers the cell viability to 25.1 ± 4.6% and 17.4 ± 3.4% of BEAS-2B and HepG2 cell (100 μg mL−1). To further distinguish the cytotoxicity of PDT and PTT, the ROS capturer (GSH) was added, the cytotoxicity also remained at 50.6 ± 5.0%, derived from the PTT (Fig. S9†). And the contribution of PDT can be calculated to be 23.4 ± 3.6%. The cytotoxicity of the chemotherapy was exhibited from SMDSP group, revealing that 16.0 ± 2.8% derived from the GSH-triggered Dox release.

As we know, Sb is a high-Z element with a high X-ray attenuation coefficient, which can be thought of as potential contrast agent for CT imaging. From Fig. 7A, the sample SMP can induce an obvious CT contrast and the CT signal also exhibits a novel liner relationship with the Sb element concentration in vitro. Moreover, the in vivo CT imaging behavior was also investigated, as shown in Fig. 7C and D. After the intratumor injection of SMP suspension, the enhanced signal in mouse can be seen in both axial and coronal CT images, making the potential application as a CT contrast agent. In view of the novel photothermal property, the thermal-imaging potential also was investigated. From Fig. 7E, under NIR irradiation for 10 min, the temperature in the tumor region climbs to 58.8 °C, while it only increases by 3.9 °C for the control group with a saline injection. And the temperature increment can also be visualized from thermal imaging, as demonstrated in Fig. 7F. The dual-imaging capacity further ensures the high accuracy.

In order to assess the therapeutic effect of the as-synthesized nano-agent, in vivo experiments have been carried out. Firstly, 20 of H22 tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, NIR, SMDSP, and SMDSP + NIR groups, and then the SMDSP solutions were injected intravenously. The changes in the weight of the mice and the tumor volume for the four groups were recorded every two days during the process (Fig. 8A and B). All the groups show a slight increment of body weight and normal behavioral conditions, demonstrating the low side/untoward effect of the treatment means. The tumor volume of the control and NIR group increased quickly, close to 6 times in comparison with the initial size. Moreover, the curative effect of the pure chemotherapy of SMDSP is also not desirable, showing a near 4 times tumor expansion. Inversely, the tumor growth is obviously inhibited for the SMDSP + NIR group, and the tumor tends to disappear after 2 weeks, as is confirmed by the photographs of these mice shown in Fig. 8C. In addition, the H&E stained tumor slices further demonstrate the obvious tissue damage in the SMDSP + NIR group compared with that in the others, attributed to the synergistic PDT, PTT, and chemotherapy. Besides, the slices of major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney) of SMDSP + NIR and the control group were investigated after two weeks of treatment. After treatment for 14 days, there was no obvious tissue damage or inflammatory lesion in the major organs and no abnormal changes in the routine blood analysis after treatment, further testifying the feasibility of bioapplication (Fig. 8D and E). Moreover, during the therapy period, feces and urine were collected and analyzed by ICP. As displayed in Fig. 8F, a large amount of the Sb element was found in the feces and urine, confirming that the nanocomposite can be metabolized via feces and urine within 14 days.

Conclusions
In this paper, Sb2Se3 nanorods were synthesized as a new photosensitizer, possessing high photothermal conversion efficiency (45.2%) and NIR-triggered ROS generation owing to the narrow band gap (1.1 eV) and considerable NIR response. Based on the energy band level of Sb2Se3, it was found that photoinduced electrons and dissolved O2 determined the ROS generation. Moreover, mesoporous silica was coated outside to improve the biocompatibility and to supply abundant space for Dox. Ammonium nitrate, which was used as an ion-exchange agent to remove the surfactant CTAB, was also considered as an etchant to induce the hollow structure of Sb2Se3@mSiO2. Then, the sensitive Se–Se silane coupling agent was prepared and modified outside to encapsulate Dox molecules in the mesopores. The high expression of GSH in cancer cells can reduce the Se–Se bonds to induce bond breakage (to form –SeH). Therefore, Sb2Se3@mSiO2-Dox-Se-Se exhibits targeted drug release in cancer cells. What is more, the consumption of intracellular GSH can disrupt the redox balance in cancer cells, which would promote the PDT efficiency. The high-Z element of Sb possesses a high X-ray attenuation coefficient, leading to high contrast in CT imaging of the composite. This is associated with thermal imaging and multi-therapy (PDT/PTT/chemotherapy), revealing the potential application to cancer treatment.
