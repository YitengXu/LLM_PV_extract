    , Accepted 2nd April 2011First published on 6th May 2011AbstractA series of low-bandgap alternating copolymers consisting of electron-accepting quinoxaline derivatives and electron-donating carbazole or fluorene were synthesized via a Suzuki coupling reaction. For the purpose of improving the molecular packing of polymer chains and to enhance the charge carrier mobility in the packing direction, a new quinoxaline derivative, 10,13-bis-(4-octyl-thiophene-2-yl)-dibenzo[a,c]phenazine, which is expected to have planar polycyclic structure, was synthesized and introduced as a new building block of alternating copolymers instead of frequently-used 5,8-dithien-2-yl-2,3-diphenylquinoxaline. Copolymers with the planar quinoxaline derivative exhibited better optical and structural properties compared to copolymers with a less planar quinoxaline derivative. A power conversion efficiency was achieved up to 3.8% when the copolymer with planar quinoxaline derivative was blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester as an active layer material in bulk heterojunction solar cells.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells have attracted tremendous attention over the last decade due to their potential of being fabricated by a high-throughput roll-to-roll process and providing low-cost solar electricity.1,2 The record high efficiency has continually increased to its current value of higher than 7% due to synergetic advancement in the device optimization, understanding of organic semiconductor physics, and development of new materials.3,4 Particularly, significant progress has been made in designing semiconducting low-bandgap polymers to maximize the light absorption, especially at longer wavelengths where much of the photon flux emitted from the sun is found.
In recent years, low-bandgap polymers based on the internal donor–acceptor (D–A) interaction have attracted great interest because their electronic properties can be easily tuned by proper combination of D and A units and their absorption ranges can be extended to longer wavelengths.5–7 Among a wide variety of acceptor units, quinoxaline units (Qx) have been shown to be an excellent building block for synthesis of low-bandgap conjugated polymers because of the electron-withdrawing property of two imine nitrogens in the Qx unit. The Qx unit has a fascinating structure for controlling the electronic structure of the resulting copolymers, because it can provide the versatility of introducing substituents easily on the 2 and 3 positions of itself. Using Qx derivatives, several research groups have synthesized D–A type low-bandgap copolymers and reported the photovoltaic properties of those copolymers.8–11 Among Qx derivatives, 5,8-dithien-2-yl-2,3-diphenylquinoxaline has been reported to be the most efficient building block when it was copolymerized with thiophene, demonstrating a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 6%.12 However, most of the alternating copolymers composed of electron-accepting 5,8-dithien-2-yl-2,3-diphenylquinoxaline and electron-donating carbazole or fluorene have shown poorer photovoltaic performance with PCEs less than 2%.13–15 The low efficiency is probably due to the non-planar nature of the two pendent phenyl groups attached on Qx, leading to poor interchain packing and thus to suppress hole mobility.
Along with the light-harvesting ability, high charge carrier mobility of conjugated polymers is also beneficial for improving the performance of polymer solar cells. In general, high charge transport requires close packing of polymer chains, facilitating charge transport through intermolecular hopping. In the present work, a new quinoxaline derivative, 10,13-bis-(5-bromo-4-octyl-thiophene-2-yl)-dibenzo[a,c]phenazine (TBPz), which is expected to have a planar structure and thus to facilitate the molecular packing of the resulting copolymer, was synthesized and used as a new building block of alternating copolymers (Scheme 1). When the mobility and PCE of copolymers with TBPz are compared with those of 5,8-bis-(5-bromo-4-octyl-thiophene-2-yl)-2,3-diphenyl-quinoxaline (TPQx), which is not expected to have planar structure, the copolymers with TBPz shows a higher charge mobility and better PCE than the copolymers with TPQx. One of the TBPz-based copolymers, poly(N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-10,13-bis-(4-octyl-thiophene-2-yl)-dibenzo[a,c]phenazine) (PCTBPz), showed the best photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 3.8% when blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an active layer in BHJ solar cells.

General characterization methods
The chemical structures of the materials used in this study were identified by 1H NMR (Avance DPX-300) and 13C NMR (Avance DPX-500). Elemental analysis was performed on an EA1110 (CE Instrument) elemental analyzer. Molecular weight and its distribution were measured by gel permeation chromatography (Waters) equipped with a Waters 2414 refractive index detector using THF as an eluent, where the columns were calibrated against standard polystyrene samples. The optical absorption spectra were obtained by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 25, Perkin Elmer). Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out on a potentiostat/galvanostat (VMP 3, Biologic) in an electrolyte solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in dichloromethane. A three-electrode cell was used for all experiments. Platinum wires (Bioanalytical System Inc.) were used as both counter and working electrodes, and silver/silver ion (Ag in 0.1 M AgNO3 solution, Bioanalytical System Inc.) was used as a reference electrode. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was obtained from an X-ray diffractometer (M18XHF-SRA, McScience) using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at a scan rate of 2° min−1. TEM observations were performed on a JEOL JEM1010 at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV.
Fabrication and characterization of photovoltaic devices

Polymer solar cells were fabricated on ITO glass cleaned by stepwise sonication in acetone and IPA, followed by O2 plasma treatment for 10 min. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on the ITO glass at 4000 rpm for 1 min and annealed at 120 °C for 30 min to yield a 40 nm thick film. A mixture of polymer and PC71BM were dissolved in anhydrous o-dichlorobenzene (30 mg ml−1), and spin-coated on the top of the ITO–PEDOT:PSS film at 700–800 rpm for 60 s. The typical thickness of the active layer was 80–90 nm. Lithium fluoride (1 nm) and aluminum (100 nm) were evaporated, under a vacuum lower than 10−6 Torr, on the top of the active layer through a shadow mask. The effective area of the cell was ca. 4 mm2. The current–voltage (J–V) curves of the device were obtained on a computer-controlled Keithley 4200 source measurement unit under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated by an Oriel solar simulator (Oriel 91160A). The light intensity was calibrated using a NREL-certified photodiode prior to each measurement. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a Polaronix K3100 IPCE measurement system (McScience). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si cell.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route for synthesis of the monomers and polymers are shown in Scheme 1 and Scheme 2, respectively. Considering that the cyclization of the two pendent phenyl rings on the 2 and 3 positions of the Qx unit may influence the properties of the resulting polymers, two different Qx derivatives (2 and 4 in Scheme 1) were synthesized and used as a building block for alternating copolymers. 3-Octylthiophene was attached to both sides of monomers 2 and 4via the Stille coupling reaction in order to enhance the charge mobility and to increase the solubility of both the monomers and resulting copolymers in organic solvents. Bromination of monomers 3 and 5 with NBS affords two final monomers, TPQx and TBPz, respectively. A fluorene or carbazole derivative was coupled to each of Qx derivatives via the palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction to afford alternating copolymers. All the polymers synthesized in this study are highly soluble in common organic solvents such as THF, chloroform, chlorobenzene, and dichlorobenzene at room temperature. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers are listed in Table 1. The molecular weights of TBPz-based polymers (17–22 kg mol−1) are slightly lower than those of TPQx-based polymers (24–30 kg mol−1). This is probably because TBPz has a more planar structure which more effectively induces interchain interaction of the polymer chains, resulting in a lower solubility.

Optical properties
The absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform solution and thin film are shown in Fig. 1a and 1b, respectively. All of the polymers showed two absorption peaks, which is a common feature of donor–acceptor type copolymers.19,20 The absorption peak at shorter wavelength is attributed to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone, while the absorption peak at longer wavelength corresponds to the intramolecular charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor. It is noted that the absorption spectra of TBPz-based polymers are red-shifted compared to those of TPQx-based polymers. This is because the cyclization of the two pendent phenyl groups on the Qx unit induces planarity along the chain backbone and hence enhances the effective conjugation length, resulting in a lower bandgap. This result is consistent with other reports that a large bathochromic shift of the absorption spectrum is observed for the phenanthrene-fused planar thienopyrazine derivative.21 Particularly, when the maximum absorption wavelengths of the polymers in solution are compared with those in solid state (Fig. 1avs.Fig. 1b), it reveals that TBPz-based polymers show a pronounced peak broadening and red shift of absorption edges, indicating that the polymer chains are highly aggregated in the solid state. The optical bandgaps (Eg(opt)), as determined from the onset of the absorption spectra of the TBPz-based polymers, are ∼1.7 eV which is close to the ideal bandgap (1.5 eV)22 of polymer solar cells, while those of TPQx-based polymers (∼1.9 eV) are not sufficiently low for wideband absorption of solar photon.

The electrochemical data of all the polymers are obtained from the oxidation and reduction cyclic voltammograms, as shown in Fig. 2, and are summarized in Table 1. The HOMO energy levels of the polymers were calculated using the equation: HOMO = −[Eox − E1/2(ferrocene) + 4.8] V, where Eox is the onset oxidation potential of the polymer and E1/2(ferrocene) is the onset oxidation potential of ferrocenevs.Ag/Ag+. The LUMO energy levels were also estimated by using the equation: LUMO = −[Ered − E1/2(ferrocene) + 4.8] V, where Ered is the onset reduction potential of the polymer. All the polymers have similar HOMO energy levels while the LUMO energy levels of the TBPz-based polymers are about 0.1 eV lower than those of the TPQx-based polymers, and thus TBPz-based polymers have lower bandgaps than TPQx-based ones. Since the open circuit voltage (Voc) of polymer solar cells is linearly dependent on the difference between the HOMO level of the electron donor and the LUMO level of the electron acceptor, the low-lying HOMO level of the donor polymer is expected to afford a high Voc for the resulting polymer solar cells. Furthermore, considering that a LUMO–LUMO offset of 0.3–0.4 eV is necessary for efficient electron transfer from donor polymer to PCBM,23 it is expected that excitons can be easily dissociated at the interface between the polymers synthesized in this study and PCBM, because the LUMO levels of the polymers (−3.30 to −3.43 eV) are sufficiently higher than that of PCBM (−4.0 eV). Judging from the electrochemical characteristics, it is concluded that the polymers synthesized in this study are promising donor materials for photovoltaic devices.

Structural properties
When the molecular organization of the copolymers was examined by XRD, all the polymers showed two diffraction peaks at around 6° and 23°, as shown in Fig. 3. The weak diffraction peak around 6° can be assigned as the interchain distance between polymer chains, where alkyl groups are expected to self-organize with an interdigitating manner. The broad peaks around 23° can be assigned as the face-to-face (π–π stacking) distance of aromatic groups in the polymer chain. Particularly, the π–π stacking distances of the two planar TBPz-based polymers, PFTBPz and PCTBPz, are 3.79 Å and 3.83 Å, respectively, while those of the less planar TPQx-based polymers, PFTPQx and PCTPQx, are 3.97 Å and 4.01 Å, respectively. The decrease in the π–π stacking distance of the TBPz-based polymers is attributed to the cyclization of the two pendent phenyl groups which makes the polymer backbone more planar and hence facilitates close-packing of polymer chains.

The effect of cyclization of the Qx derivative on the structural property of the copolymers is further examined by comparing the optimized molecular geometries of the copolymers obtained from calculation of the density functional theory. To simplify the calculation, only one repeating unit of each polymer was subjected to the calculation, and all alkyl chains are replaced by methyl groups. When the dihedral angles between the pendent phenyl groups and Qx unit are calculated, as shown in Fig. 4, a highly twisted molecular conformation, with dihedral angles of around 40°, is observed for PCTPQx, whereas these angles must be null for PCTBPz. The twisted conformation due to the pendent phenyl groups is expected to disrupt the close-packing of the polymer chains, causing the π–π stacking distances of TPQx-based polymers to increase.

Photovoltaic properties
The polymer solar cells were fabricated with a layered configuration of glass–ITO–PEDOT:PSS– polymer:PC71BM–LiF–Al. The J–V characteristics of photovoltaic devices prepared from polymer:PC71BM (1:3 w/w) using o-dichlorobenzene as a processing solvent are represented in Fig. 5, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. It should be noted here that the Vocs of all the devices are higher than those of P3HT-based devices (∼0.60 V), which is in accordance with the low-lying HOMO levels of our polymers. The Voc of a BHJ solar cell is governed mostly by the difference between the LUMO level of the acceptor and the HOMO level of the donor, although other factors should also be taken into account, such as geminate recombination and resistance due to the thickness and morphology of the active layer. The devices of PCTBPz and PFTBPz exhibit PCEs of 3.80% and 2.61%, respectively, while their TPQx-based counterparts, PCTPQx and PFTPQx, show PCEs of 1.85% and 1.57%, respectively. The difference in PCE between the two types of polymers is attributed largely to the difference in the short-circuit current density (Jsc): The Jscs of the TBPz-based devices are higher than those of the TPQx-based devices. The Jsc difference may arise from two sources: first, TBPz-based polymers have a broader absorption of the solar spectrum than TPQx-based polymers, as shown in Fig. 1. Secondly, TBPz-based polymers may have a higher charge mobility than those of TPQx-based polymers due to an enhanced π–π stacking.

To quantitatively investigate the effect of interchain packing on the charge transport property, hole mobility was measured from the space charge limited current (SCLC) J–V curves as obtained in the dark using hole-only devices (ITO–PEDOT:PSS–polymer or polymer:PC71BM–Au). The SCLC behavior is analyzed using the Mott–Gurney law:24J = (9/8)εμ(V2L−3), where ε is the static dielectric constant of the medium, μ is the charge carrier mobility, V = Va − Vbi (Va, the applied bias; Vbi, the built-in potential due to the difference in electrical contact work functions), and L is the layer thickness. The mobility is obtained from the slope of the plot of J1/2vs. V (Fig. 6). When the hole mobilities of pure polymers are compared, it has been observed that hole mobilities of the two TBPz-based polymers, PCTBPz and PFTBPz (4.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s and 3.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s, respectively), are higher than those of the two TPQx-based polymers, PCTPQx and PFTPQx (7.26 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s and 5.87 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s, respectively). The enhancement of hole mobility for TBPz-based polymers may arise from the denser packing of polymers with the more planar Qx derivative, as evidenced from XRD analysis (Fig. 3). Likewise, higher hole mobility was also observed for the blends of TBPz-based polymers and PC71BM compared with the blends of TPQx-based polymers and PC71BM:PCTBPz, 3.51 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s vs.PCTPQx, 1.27 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s; PFTBPz, 2.65 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s vs.PFTPQx, 1.13 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s. However, the hole mobilities of TBPz-based polymer blends are decreased by 1 order of magnitude compared to those of pure polymers. This is probably because the morphologies of the blend films show phase separation with very small and discontinuous domains to some extent (Fig. S9†).

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices under monochromatic light is shown in Fig. 7. Compared with the TPQx-based polymers, the TBPz-based polymers show higher EQE values and a broader spectral response in the range of 300–760 nm. The device from PCTBPz:PC71BM shows a considerably high incident photon to current efficiency of 65% at 480 nm. When the Jsc value was calculated from integration of the EQE spectrum of PCTBPz:PC71BM device, it was 8.95 mA cm−2 which is close to the Jsc value (9.38 mA cm−2) obtained from the J–V measurement (Fig. 5). Further device optimization such as interface engineering between the active layer and cathode, and control of film morphology using a mixed solvent is needed to improve the device performance.

Conclusions
We have synthesized a series of D–A low-bandgap alternating copolymers composed of electron-donating carbazole or fluorene and electron-accepting quinoxaline derivatives by the palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction. It has been found that the optical, structural, and photovoltaic properties of the copolymers are strongly dependent upon the planarity of the building block for the alternating copolymers. The copolymers with planar quinoxaline derivatives (TBPz) have a lower bandgap and higher hole mobility than the corresponding copolymers with less planar quinoxaline derivatives (TPQx), mainly due to the enhanced intermolecular packing characteristics of TBPz-based copolymers in the solid state. A blend of PCTBPz and PC71BM exhibits a PCE of 3.80% with an open-circuit voltage of 0.81 V, a short-circuit current density of 9.38 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 50% under AM 1.5 condition (100 mW cm−2). This result demonstrates that a new planar quinoxaline derivative, TBPz, is a promising building block that can be combined with many other electron-rich units to develop D–A type alternating copolymers for achieving high performance solar cells.
