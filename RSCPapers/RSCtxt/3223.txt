    , Accepted 12th September 2022First published on 13th September 2022AbstractSide chains generally dictate molecular packing and film morphology and critically affect the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs), and hence, side-chain engineering plays a substantial role in achieving high-performance OSCs. In this work, a series of non-fullerene acceptor molecules with A–D–A structures, L6–L11, having gradient branched alkyl-chains on dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP)-based asymmetrical chlorinated acceptors were designed and synthesized. The effects of branched alkyl-chain length, ranging from n-butyl to 2-decyldodecyl chains, on their optoelectronic properties, thin film molecular packing, blend film morphology and overall photovoltaic performance were systematically studied. Interestingly, the results indicated that with the increase in alkyl-chain length, the open-circuit-voltage (VOC) is monotonously increased, while the short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) perceive a distinct parabolic trend. The reasons for the variation trend of photoelectric parameters were analyzed. Finally, a 2-butyloctyl chain-containing acceptor L8-based device demonstrated a champion PCE of 15.40% with a VOC of 0.864 V, a JSC of 23.63 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.754, which is the highest PCE for non-fullerene binary OSCs based on asymmetric ITIC-type acceptors. Further studies indicate that the proper 2-butyloctyl side chain could induce more favorable face-on molecule orientation, enhance carrier mobility, balance charge transport and suppress recombination loss. Our results will provide valuable guidelines for accelerating the understanding of the acceptor structure-photovoltaic performance relationship of OSC materials.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn great attention in recent years due to their distinct advantages of light-weight, mechanical flexibility and facile large-area fabrication;1–9 hence, they exhibit bright commercialization application prospects. In recent years, studies on OSCs have made great progress, especially after the discovery of high-efficiency non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) architecture.6–10 With the appearance of both iconic NFA molecules, ITIC11 and Y6,12 the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the state-of-the-art single-junction OSCs have achieved over 18%,13–27 revealing a broad development potential. A–D–A acceptors possess unique advantages such as facile synthesis, excellent light-harvesting performance, adjustable energy levels, tunable self-aggregation, and good crystallinity properties.28–36 Therefore, most efforts have been focused on A–D–A acceptors in the last few years and devoted to changing or modifying the fused rings of the molecular backbone (D), electron-withdrawing abilities of the end group (A) and peripheral side chains.37–49
Among the three molecular designing strategies, side-chain engineering constitutes one of the key aspects and is of vital importance for high-efficiency OSCs.50 Not only are the side chains naturally needed for providing a satisfactory solubility required for purification and device processing, but they also dictate molecular packing and film morphology and critically affect the efficiency of OSCs.51,52 Li group53 developed a low band gap acceptor (m-ITIC) by manipulating the side-chain isomerism of the alkyl–phenyl substituent of ITIC. Higher electron mobility, higher absorption coefficient and stronger preference for face-on molecular orientation were achieved, and consequently, they corresponded well with improvements in JSC, FF and PCE from 10.57% to 11.77%. Hou group54 shortened the n-undecyl to n-nonyl chain at the edge of the central donating core to design an Y6-type acceptor BTP-eC9, which enhanced the PCE from 16.9% to 17.8%. Sun group17 replaced a n-undecyl chain with linked peripheral branched alkyl-chains on the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene unit to synthesize acceptor L8-BO, which achieved a considerably high PCE of 18.32% for single-junction OSC devices. As can be seen, a subtler difference in substituent structures could bring about appreciable differences in the morphology and performance of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) films. Accordingly, it is very important to investigate the effect of different alkyl chains on the properties of this family of NFAs, especially by understanding the acceptor structure-photovoltaic performance relationship of OSC materials.
As is known to all, the alkyl chain should typically attach on the aromatic/heteroaromatic units for playing its unique role. Therefore, a series of rigid fused-ring π-systems have been widely employed as building units in NFAs, for example, thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT),55 benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT),56 and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP).57 The DTP stands out as a universal electron-donating block that contains heteroatoms of sulfur and nitrogen, and the occupied p orbitals of heteroatoms are in conjugation with π orbitals of aromatics units, offering strong charge-transfer properties. Besides, the electron-rich nitrogen atom can increase the stability in the oxidized state and further decrease the band gap.58 Therefore, DTP-based semiconductors have been widely used in the OSC field via judicious molecular regulation. For instance, Tang group59 developed a symmetrical NFA material named INPIC-4F with DTP as a core unit and end-capped by fluorinated 3-(dicyanomethylidene)-indan-1-one (IC). This NFA exhibits favorable crystallinity and an optimal bicontinuous network when blended with donor PBDB-T, and hence, INPIC-4F-based devices showed an excellent PCE of 13.13% in binary devices. Previously, we have developed a dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP)-based asymmetric acceptor,60 TPIC-4Cl, which exhibited easy synthesis features and highly efficient OSC performance (PCE = 15.31%) paired with polymeric donor PM7, proving that the introduction of DTP into the fused ring is very effective and deserves further investigation to improve the performance of OSCs.
Except for alkyl-chain engineering, the modification of end groups is equally important, which can tune the intermolecular packing, absorption spectra, and energy levels of NFAs.61 Many modulation approaches have been widely applied in the preparation of high-performance organic solar energy conversion materials.62–66 Among these, peripheral halogenation, especially the fluorination and chlorination of end groups, has been certified to be the most effective strategy.67–71 However, in comparison with fluorination, the chlorinated terminal units possess a more red-shifted absorption window, enhanced crystallinity, and improved device photostability.12,72 This is due to their stronger intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) effect. In addition, the synthesis cost of chlorine substitutes is remarkably cheaper than that of the fluorine counterparts, which made them more suitable for commercialization applications.
In this contribution, we combined the above-discussed strategy (alkyl-chain engineering and chlorination) to report a series of asymmetrical acceptors, namely, L6, L8, L9, L10, and L11 with reference compound L7 (TPIC-4Cl).60 All of these molecules comprise different alkyl chain lengths located at the DTP unit and identical chlorination terminals. We systematically investigated the effects of the branched alkyl chain length on their electronic and molecular crystallinity/self-aggregation properties, blended film morphology with PM6 and device performance. All of the six molecules possess a similar band-gap and a light absorption region, but distinct film morphology. In addition, we found that as the extension of branched alkyl chains, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) is monotonously increased, while the short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) and PCE perceive a distinct parabolic trend. JSC, FF, and PCE perceived a distinct parabolic trend. Consequently, the PM6:L8 based OSC achieved a superior PCE of 15.40% compared with 13.53% of PM6:L6, 14.03% of PM6:L7, and 14.28% of PM6:L9, 13.95% of PM6:L10, and 13.72% of PM6:L11. Moreover, 15.40% is the highest PCE for non-fullerene binary OSCs based on asymmetric ITIC-type SMAs. The outstanding performance of the PM6:L8 system is mainly due to more balanced hole/electron mobility, less charge recombination and more favorable morphology. Therefore, this research accelerates the understanding of the acceptor structure-device performance relationships of NFA-based OSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Material synthesis and characterization
The synthesis details of L6–L11 are provided in Scheme S1.† We utilized a similar synthetic route60 to obtain a DTP-based core DTPCX analogue, named DTPC6 with a n-butyl chain. Then, the dialdehydes DTPC6-2CHO were synthesized by formylation with phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3)/N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Followed by the Knoevenagel condensation of DTPC4-2CHO with 2-(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malono-nitrile (2Cl-IC), L6 was obtained as a dark-blue solid. Then, we introduced other alkyl chains with gradient substituent lengths from 2-ethylhexyl to 2-decyldodecyl chains, and the other series of NFAs were named L7, L8, L9, L10 and L11, respectively (Fig. 1a). L6–L11 all exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene. Chemical structures of L6–L11 were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The related characterization results are provided in the ESI.† Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed to assess the thermal properties of the as-synthesized molecules. As depicted in Fig. S1,† all of six compounds are thermally stable with high decomposition temperatures (Td) exceeding 300 °C, suggesting their sufficient stability for the photovoltaic applications.

2.2 Optoelectronic properties
The optical absorption properties of L6–L11 were studied in dilute chloroform solutions and on thin-films (Fig. 1c). The corresponding photophysical parameters are given in Table S1.† The absorption band of L6 in the solution concentrated at 600 to 800 nm, with a maximum peak located at 750 nm. After introducing other alkyl chains, there is nearly no change of the absorption peaks. The maximum molar extinction coefficient for L6 is 2.75 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 750 nm, while the highest value is observed for L8 of 3.13 × 105 M−1 cm−1 in solution. From solutions to solid films, the spectra red-shift and the absorption peaks locate at ca. 805 nm. This phenomenon was also observed in blend films with PM6 (Fig. 1d).
2.3 Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of L6–L11 were examined by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, in which ferrocene was used as the external standard. The energy levels of L6–L11 were estimated, and are depicted in Fig. S2a.† The HOMO levels as a whole demonstrated the gradual decreasing trend as the increase in alkyl-chain lengths. In addition, L7–L11 showed a similar LUMO energy and ranged from −3.91 eV to −3.93 eV. L6 exhibited an obviously deeper LUMO level of −3.97 eV. The energy level alignment indicated that the L6-based devices may possess the lowest VOC value, which is consistent with the measured VOC value. The electrochemical bandgaps (ECVg) of L6–L11 were calculated to be 1.59, 1.61, 1.69, 1.73, 1.72 and 1.75 eV. In brief, the six molecules exhibit a slight downward trend in HOMO levels and an upward trend in LUMO levels with the increase in alkyl chain lengths of the DTP.
2.4 Photovoltaic performances
To analyze the photovoltaic performance of L6–L11, we fabricated OSC devices with a conventional configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/PM6:acceptors/naphthalene diimide-functionalized N-oxide (PDNIT-F3N)/Ag. The star polymer PM6 was chosen as the donor material ascribed to the complimentary light absorption and well-matched energy levels with the six acceptors. The detailed optimization processes including donor/acceptor blending ratio, additive ratio, thermal annealing temperature and spin-coating speed are shown in Tables S2–S5.† The best-performing current-density–voltage (J–V) curves of the corresponding OSC devices are illustrated in Fig. 2a, and the photovoltaic metrics are listed in Table 1. The OSC based on L6 shows a PCE of 13.53%, with a VOC of 0.844 V, a JSC of 22.50 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71.3%. With the extension of alkyl chains, the efficiency gradually improved and reached a maximum PCE of L8-based OSCs. Then PCE gradually decreased to 13.72% for the L11-based OSC. A champion device based on PM6:L8 delivers the highest PCE of 15.40%, with a VOC of 0.864 V, a JSC of 23.63 mA cm−2, and a FF of 75.4%. Interestingly, the VOC value for L6–L11 showed a monotonic increase from 0.844 V to 0.881 V with the increase in alkyl chain length. Otherwise, JSC and FF exhibited a distinct parabolic trend, which can speculate on the cause owing to the different molecular stacking and charge mobility.

With regard to the open-circuit voltage change, it is generally recognized that the higher LUMO level can obtain higher voltages.73 In our asymmetrical TPIC system, L6 owns the lowest LUMO energy level and naturally gets the lowest voltage. Nonetheless, the other (L7–L11) LUMO energy levels are similar, but the VOC values of OSCs are significantly growing along with the extension of alkyl chains. Hence, energy loss (Eloss) analysis was tentatively studied. According to the equation Eloss = Eg − QVOC, the Eloss values of the OSCs based on L6–L11 are 0.586 eV (L6),0.572 eV (L7), 0.566 eV (L8), 0.561 eV (L9), 0.552 eV (L10) and 0.539 eV (L11), respectively. Therefore, their energy loss also decreases gradually to be in line with the VOC trend. We may attribute this monotonously increased VOC to the incremental donor–acceptor spacing (D–A spacing) owing to the enhancement of alkyl chains, which can realize significantly reduced non-radiative decay of charge carriers (knr) and improved device voltage.74
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimal devices based on L6–L11 are displayed in Fig. 2b. It can be noted that all the EQE spectra exhibited a higher intensity across the wavelength ranging from 450 to 850 nm, and the maximum EQE value was ascribed to the PM6:L8-based device. Furthermore, the integrated current densities from the EQE curves match well with the integrated JSC values from the J–V tests (within the 5% error), indicating that the measured performance parameters have good accuracy and reliability.
2.5 Charge carrier mobilities
To probe the charge transport behaviors for six acceptors and blend films, electron (μe) and hole (μh) mobilities have been measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S3†). The detailed data are summarized in Table S6.† The μe value of six neat films exhibited an obvious parabolic trend similar to the variation in JSC and FF. The μe value of L8 came out to be the highest value of 1.54 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. As for the blended films, a similar trend also persisted. The PM6:L6 and PM6:L11 blended films revealed μe and μh values of 8.92 × 10−5/1.11 × 10−4 and 9.94 × 10−5/1.20 × 10−4, respectively. The lower and unbalanced mobilities will cause more charge recombination and thus decrease the JSC and FF values. Meanwhile, PM6:L8 films surmised higher and more balanced electron/hole mobilities (1.41 × 10−4/1.38 × 10−4, μe/μh = 1.02), which is beneficial for the charge transport and leads to improved JSC and FF.75
2.6 Exciton dissociation and charge extraction
The exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency were demonstrated by the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) vs. effective voltage (Veff). The dissociation probability (Pdiss) defined as the ratio of the short-circuit photocurrent density and the saturated current density (Jph/Jsat) is a crucial characteristic to evaluate the efficiency of the exciton dissociation as well as the charge extraction behavior. Fig. 3a shows the Jphversus Veff curves and the key device parameters are gathered in Table S7.† The PM6:L6-based optimal device shows a Jph/Jsat ratio of 93.61%, while 81.03% under maximum power output condition. With the increase in branched side-chain length, there existed the first increasing and then decreasing trend similar to the change in JSC and FF. In comparison to PM6:L6, PM6:L11 with the 2-decyldodecyl chain shows slightly higher Jph/Jsat ratios of 95.96 and 81.49% under the corresponding conditions, respectively. Indeed, PM6:L8 shows Jph/Jsat ratios of 98.18 and 84.4% under the corresponding conditions, respectively. It uncovers much less recombination loss, leads to more efficient charge transfer and promotes JSC and FF.75

To further understand the charge carrier recombination behavior of the OSCs, we then measured the JSC and VOC independence on the incident light intensity (Plight) of different devices. The relationship between JSC and Plight is plotted in Fig. 3b. The exponential factor (α) of the power-law equation JSC ∝ Plight is to investigate the degree of bimolecular recombination. If all free charge carriers are swept out and collected at the electrodes prior to recombination, the α value tends to approach the limit 1. The α values of six acceptor-based devices are in attachment, ca. 0.98, illustrating that all six devices underwent weak bimolecular recombination. Meanwhile, the dependence of VOCversus ln(Plight) was studied, and the fitting line is shown in Fig. 3d, which indicated the information about trap-assisted recombination. When the incident light intensity changes, VOC obeys the expression of VOC ∝ nkTln(I)/q. The slope of the expression should be nkT/e (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature and e is the elementary charge). The n value usually varies between 1 and 2, and if n = 1 indicates a trap free condition, any deviation from 1 indicates the existence of trap-assisted recombination. As presented in Fig. 3d, the six devices range in n value from 1.12 to 1.22, and hence, we can infer that trap assisted recombination was the major recombination channel in the L6–L11 blended devices under different incident light intensities. Beyond that, under the open-circuit condition, the transient photovoltage (TPV) was also measured to evaluate the lifetimes of charge carriers, which still imply the degree of recombination. By fitting the curves in Fig. 3c with exponential decay function, the carrier lifetimes of six acceptor-based devices are 13.9 (L6), 14.0 (L7), 18.1 (L8), 15.3 (L9), 13.7 (L10) and 13.2 μs (L11), respectively. The higher carrier lifetimes obtained from TPV measurements mean lower recombination. Therefore, the PM6:L8-based OSCs exhibited the lowest recombination and achieved excellent JSC and FF, while the PM6:L11-based devices possessed the highest recombination presenting rock-bottom JSC and FF.
2.7 Photoluminescence (PL) characteristics
To promote comprehending the exciton dissociation and charge transfer process of the active layer, the photoluminescence (PL) quenching behavior of PM6 and six acceptors was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy. As depicted in Fig. S4 and Table S8,† the neat PM6 film has a strong and broad PL emission peak ranging from 600 to 850 nm with a maximum at 683 nm. When added different acceptors, PM6 showed high PL quenching efficiencies between 98.76% and 99.31%. Moreover, the PL of six acceptors was also quenched by adding PM6, as shown in Fig. S5 and Table S8.† The emission of L6–L11 slightly blue-shifted with the increase in alkyl chain length and located in the range of 960–980 nm in the neat film, which was quenched obviously when blended with PM6. Furthermore, a parabolic change can be undoubtedly observed, and the PM6:L8 blend film exhibited the highest PL quenching efficiency for both the donor (99.31%) and the acceptor (93.39%), consistent with the highest JSC and FF of the resulting OSCs. These results indicate that the photogenerated excitons can be dissociated into free charge carriers at the BHJ interface efficiently.
2.8 Surface energy and miscibility
To investigate the effects of introducing different branched alkyl side-chains on the miscibility between the donor and acceptor, pure water (H2O) and ethylene glycol (EG) were chosen as test solvents to measure the contact angles (θ) on the pristine films of PM6 and L6–L11; the corresponding data were calculated and the results are summarized in Table S9.† The surface energy (γ) of the acceptors demonstrated a distinct parabolic change. L8 (γL8 = 49.50 mJ m−2) was remarkably higher than the other acceptors (γL6 = 39.40 mJ m−2, γL7 = 48.28 mJ m−2, γL9 = 43.39 mJ m−2, γL10 = 43.10 mJ m−2 and γL11 = 42.66 mJ m−2). Moreover, the miscibility between PM6 and these acceptors can be quantized by the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) according to the surface tensions of donors/acceptors (Table S9†). The smaller the χ value is, the better the miscibility will be and vice versa. Clearly, the χ value of PM6:L6 (0.006 K) is remarkably lower than that of other counterparts, indicating very good molecular miscibility of PM6:L6. The χ value of PM6:L8 (0.695 K) is strikingly highest in these acceptors, revealing that L8 is less miscible with PM6. This result indicates that the original miscibility between PM6 and L6 could be excessive and leads to a morphology that is overmixed to a certain extent in the blend film, whereas the blend of PM6 with L8 can reduce the miscibility and increase phase separation.75
2.9 Morphology characterization
The atomic force microscopy (AFM) technology was utilized to study the morphology of the six blend films with the variation in the branched alkyl chain. The height and phase images are presented in Fig. 4 and S6,† respectively. The root mean square (RMS) is also shown on the images of Fig. 4. The surfaces of the six blends were uniform, and no agglomeration was formed. Moreover, the L6 blend exhibited a smoother surface (RMS = 1.388 nm) compared with the other surface roughness values, further corroborating the better miscibility between L6 and PM6. By contrast, the PM6:L10 and PM6:L11 blend films show a notably higher RMS of 2.218 and 2.310 nm, indicating better crystallinity, whereas the PM6:L8 blend exhibits a medium RMS (1.620 nm), suggesting a uniform and smooth surface agreeing well with the decreased tendency of molecular packing, as shown in the GIWAXS results to be discussed. As shown in the AFM phase images (Fig. S6†), the six blends exhibited a uniform morphology but different domain sizes. The PM6:L8 and PM6:L9 blends presented obviously smaller domain sizes than those of the other four blends (L6, L7, L10 and L11). Meanwhile, the surface morphology of PM6:L8 showed distinct wheat-like interpenetrated fibril networks, which can be beneficial for the generation and extraction of charges in the OSCs with the improved JSC and FF. These results indicate that branched 2-butyloctyl chain-substituted acceptor L8 is beneficial for achieving suitable donor/acceptor distribution and phase separation scale in the blend films, leading to a more ordered crystallization tendency and efficient charge transport.

To further quest the active layer morphology differences including crystallization and molecular packing caused by changing the branched alkyl chains on acceptors, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed. The 2D-GIWAXS images of six neat and blend films are demonstrated in Fig. 5a and S7.† The corresponding 1D line-cut profiles in the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) direction are shown in Fig. 5b and S8.† The homologous data are collected in Table S10.† For the pure PM6 film, the IP and OOP profiles present the distinct (100) lamellar peaks at 0.30 Å, implying the strong crystallinity. Besides, another moderate π–π stacking peak was observed at 1.67 Å, which corresponds to the π–π stacking distance (dπ) of 3.76 Å, suggesting coexisting face-on and edge-on stacking orientation. The six acceptors also showed obvious (010) diffraction peaks (1.72–1.75 Å) in the OOP direction and (100) diffraction peaks (0.31–0.33 Å) in the IP direction, respectively. The corresponding π–π stacking and lamellar stacking distances were 3.60–3.65 Å for the (010) peaks and 19.60–20.10 Å for the (100) peaks, respectively. All of these six acceptors display almost the same “face on” stacking patterns in neat films. Moreover, in the OOP direction, the crystal coherence length (CCL) calculated by the Scherrer equation was about 57.0–95.0 Å for six acceptors. The different CCL implied a variant crystallinity in their respective films. Notably, with the progressive increase in the branched alkyl-chain length, the CCL value presented a spiraling trend. L6 and L11 display the lowest and highest CCLs, respectively. Therefore, the neat film of L6 and L11 show the weakest and strongest crystallinity compared with the other acceptors.

After blending with donor PM6 in Fig. 5, the six blend films showed the (010) diffraction peaks in the OOP direction and the (100) diffraction peaks in the IP direction, illustrating the preferential face-on orientation, just liking the situation in their neat films. Besides, the (010) diffraction peaks of six blends in the OOP direction located at 0.30 Å−1 came from donor PM6, which indicated that the crystallinity of PM6 took a predominant status in the blends. Moreover, dπ and lamellar d-spacing of blend films showed a slightly larger value than the neat films. In the OOP direction, the six blends showed a new (010) diffraction peak at 1.70–1.72 Å−1, implying that the six acceptors formed good miscibility with PM6 in the blend films. Interestingly, the CCL value in the OOP direction shows a parabolic trend as a whole, and it displays distinct trend with the neat films. The CCL of PM6:L8 blend emerged the slightly higher value and indicated the relatively strong crystallization. Wherefore, PM6:L8 formed a favorable morphology with the suitable domain size and good phase separation. While PM6:L6 and PM6:L11 just displayed the weak crystallization behavior, and the unfavorable interpenetrating networks formed, which was consistent with the result from AFM images. The above-mentioned results indicated that the addition of the donor induces different crystallinities of the blend films. Moreover, this demonstrated that molecule L8 modified with an appropriate 2-butyloctyl chain enhanced intermolecular stacking and promoted adequately attenuated crystallinity, matching with the improved charge-carrier mobility in the BHJ film.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we presented that branched alkyl chains in chlorinated TPIC-series acceptors could boost the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Six acceptors, namely, L6, L7, L8, L9, L10 and L11 with the increasing alkyl chain length attached on the dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) units, which showed negligible absorption changes but slightly downshifted HOMO levels and upshifted LUMO levels. Furthermore, it was found that the alkyl chain showed a great impact on the blend morphology. As a result, the optimal side chains in L8 endowed highly efficient OSC devices with a champion PCE of 15.40%, which is the highest PCE for non-fullerene binary OSCs based on asymmetric ITIC-type NFAs. Interesting, the experimental results indicated that with the increase in alkyl-chain length, the open-circuit voltage is monotonously increased, and the JSC and FF values perceived a distinct parabolic change. Additionally, optimal chains could induce a more favorable face-on orientation, and improve charge separation and transport in photovoltaic devices. Overall, our findings provide a detailed side chain investigation and furnish a guide for efficient molecular design of non-fullerene acceptors towards high-performance OSCs.
