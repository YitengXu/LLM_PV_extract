1. Introduction
Present interest in conjugated polymers is mainly based on their intriguing electronic and optoelectronic properties, which enable applications in a variety of optoelectronic devices such as polymeric light emitting diodes,1 field effect transistors,2 and photovoltaic cells.3 One way to prepare suitable polymers is based on the incorporation of chromophores with strong light absorption or emission into π-conjugated backbones. Useful chromophores can be found among organic colorants and dyestuffs, especially in the field of so-called high-performance pigments such as diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPPs),4 isoindigo,5 or quinacridones.6 Present research activities are focused on new polymer materials for solar cell applications, which enable the preparation of devices with high power conversion efficiency (PCE).7 For this purpose conjugated polymers with broad and strong absorption in the visible and near infrared, large hole and electron mobilities, low band gaps, and suitable energy levels matching with the electron acceptors (mostly fullerene derivatives) are required. Especially in conjugated copolymers with donor–acceptor (D–A) architecture the electronic properties can be tailored by independently combining electron-rich and electron-deficient segments. Several studies were already dealing with DPP-containing D–A-polymers, which could be used to prepare devices with PCE-values up to 8%.7a More recently other chromophores such as benzo- and naphthodifuranones, and benzo- and naphthodipyrrolidones, which are structurally related to DPP, have been used to construct low band gap polymers, which might be suitable for photovoltaic applications. Benzo- and naphthodiones exhibit a tri- and tetracyclic structure with a more extended π-conjugated system, which lowers the LUMO level and leads to higher electron affinity, and lower band gap. The presence of heteroatoms in the central rings favors intermolecular interactions, which enhances the charge transport.
The purpose of the present article is to review the synthetic pathways and the characteristic optical and electrochemical properties of monomers and polymers based on benzo- and naphthodiones. Device properties are also discussed. Molecular structures and denotation of isomeric benzo- and naphthodifuranones, and benzo- and naphthodipyrrolidones are compiled in Scheme 1.

2. Benzodifuranones
Small molecules and monomers
Benzodifuranone (BDF) and benzodipyrrolidone (BDP) belong to a class of high performance pigments, which have been developed in the last 30 years. BDF was first reported by Greenhalgh et al. in 1980.8 It was prepared upon condensation of benzoquinone with cyanoacetic acid followed by double cyclization. Subsequent oxidation in air led to the 1,5-BDF compound 1. A proposed mechanism is shown in Scheme 2.
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of 1,5-BDF derivative 1via condensation with cyanoacetic acid. 
The authors discovered that 1,5-BDF compounds can also be obtained upon a reaction of 1,4-benzoquinone or hydroquinone with mandelic acid derivates.8,9 Using 1,2-dihydroquinone or 1,2-benzoquinone instead of hydroquinone, the condensation with mandelic acid results in the 1,8-BDF compound 2 (Scheme 3).9 The 1,5- and 1,8-BDF compounds usually exhibit red colors with maximum absorption between 428 and 540 nm in solution, the color shade depending on the nature of the substituents of the phenyl rings and the core chromophore. Because of their high color value, brightness of shade and good light fastness, BDFs were commercialized as disperse dyes for textiles, especially for polyesters.8,9
 Scheme 3  Synthesis of 1,8-BDF derivative 2via double condensation with mandelic acid. 
BDF derivatives carrying an electron donating amino group in the 4-position of one of the two phenyl substituent groups exhibit a blue color. Blue amino-BDF derivatives such as 3 are strongly solvatochromic,10 the absorption maximum ranging from 498 nm (in perfluoro-t-butyl alcohol) to 702 nm (in hexamethylphosphoramide). The solvatochromism originates from the existence of mesomeric structures of 3 shown in Scheme 4. The shift of the absorption maximum to longer wavelengths is large, whenever the zwitterionic mesomeric structure is well stabilized by the solvent. A multiple square analysis of max of the solvent-dependent UV absorption band of 3 with several empirical solvent polarity parameters proved that a composite of basicity, acidity, and dipolarity/polarizability of the solvent are responsible for the solvatochromism. For the analysis, the Kamlet–Taft and Catalán solvent parameters were evaluated.11
 Scheme 4  Amino-BDF derivative 3 and its mesomeric structures. 
Recently the amino-BDF derivative 4 with bromine and n-octylamino substituent groups (Fig. 1) was reported,12 which is suitable for Pd-catalyzed amination reactions according to Buchwald and Hartwig, and for Stille and Suzuki coupling. 4 exhibits a deep blue color with absorption maximum at 628 nm and a high extinction coefficient of 6.5 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1 in dichloromethane. The solvatochromic shift of 4 from n-hexane to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is 1700 cm−1.12
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of 1,5-BDF derivatives 4–7.12–14 
In order to shift the absorption of BDF derivatives further to the red, Cerón-Carrasco et al. designed and calculated the molecular structures 5 and 6.13 The structures shown in Fig. 1 exhibit absorption maxima near 900 nm, if one or two thienyl units are present as substituents instead of phenyl rings. The LUMO of these chromophores is always located at the BDF core. Unfortunately the monomers have not been synthesized yet.
Polymers
For a polymerization via Pd-catalyzed coupling reactions the BDF derivatives have to be functionalized with bromine atoms at the phenyl substituent groups. The problem is that symmetrically substituted BDF derivatives exhibit a poor solubility and thus are not well suited for polymerization. One way to overcome this problem is to use unsymmetrically substituted BDF derivatives, which are more soluble. Therefore the first Suzuki and Stille coupling reactions were carried out with the unsymmetrical di(bromophenyl)-BDF 7 (Fig. 1), and fluorene and thiophene derivatives were used as comonomers.14 The resulting BDF-polymers P1 and P2 (Table 1) exhibit a broad UV/vis absorption ranging from 300 to 700 nm with a maximum at 557 nm, and extinction coefficients as high as 32500 L mol−1 cm−1. From cyclovoltammetric (CV) studies electrochemical band gaps as low as 1.10 eV were determined.

An alternative way of polymerization is based on the anodic oxidation of BDF derivatives followed by polymerization and precipitation of the insoluble polymer at the electrode surface. The method of electrochemical polymerization was used to polymerize symmetrical BDF derivatives flanked with 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and 3,4-ethylenedithiathiophene (EDTT) units.15 Polymer films of P3–P6 exhibit very broad UV/vis absorption spectra with maxima up to 589 nm (P3, see also Table 1). The absorption maxima of polymers with EDOT units are considerably more red-shifted than those with EDTT units. Furthermore, the electrochemical band gaps of P3 (0.44 eV) and P5 (0.36 eV) with EDOT units are 0.47 and 0.92 eV lower than for P4 and P6 with EDTT units. This indicates that the donor ability of EDOT is more powerful than EDTT. Interestingly, the polymers are electrochromic and exhibit reversible color changes from dark to almost transparent in the reductive cycle. The reason is an uptake of two electrons per BDF unit, in which the quinonoid structure is reversibly transferred into a benzoic structure (Scheme 5).15
 Scheme 5  Suggested mechanism of reduction of benzodifuranone (from ref. 15). 
Another way to polymerize symmetrical BDF derivatives was recently described by Zhang et al.16 This way is based on the use of non-oxidized, non-planar and thus more soluble BDF precursor monomers (Scheme 6). After Suzuki polycondensation of the non-oxidized BDF precursor in toluene, the resulting polymer precursor P7′ was obtained. P7′ was subsequently oxidized with nitrobenzene, which led to the conjugated 1,8-BDF-based polymer P7 in good yield.
 Scheme 6  Synthesis of conjugated 1,8-BDF-based polymer via Suzuki coupling of non-oxidized symmetrical precursor monomer followed by oxidation of the precursor polymer P7′. 
The UV/Vis absorption maximum of P7 in dichloromethane is at 555 nm, the extinction coefficient is about 32500 L mol−1 cm−1. P7 is very stable in UV-light. Upon irradiation in toluene with a 200 W Hg-lamp for 1 h P7 is only slightly decomposed, the rate constant k of decomposition being 4.7 × 10−3 min−1.
In order to prepare BDF polymers with low band gap, the aminobenzodifuranone chromophore was incorporated in the main chain.12 Aminobenzodifuranone-based polymers were either prepared upon homopolymerization of monomer 4, or by copolymerization of 1,5-(4-bromophenyl)-BDF and N,N′-dialkyl-phenylene-1,4-diamine using Pd-catalyzed aryl amination reactions reported by Hartwig,17 Buchwald,18 and Kanbara19 (Scheme 7).

Polymers P8–P10 are readily soluble in common organic solvents. Solutions exhibit a deep blue color, a high photostability, and a broad UV/Vis absorption ranging from 400 to 900 nm. The extinction coefficients are up to 3.1 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1. Furthermore, the polymers exhibit low band gaps of 1.08 to 1.23 eV. As already observed for monomer 4, the three polymers are strongly solvatochromic.12 Up to now, there is not yet any information available on electronic devices containing benzodifuranone-based polymers.
3. Benzodipyrrolidones
Small molecules and monomers
Benzodipyrrolidone (BDP) derivatives were originally prepared as colorants, and the structure of the chromophore is similar to 1,3,4,6-tetrarylpyrrolo[3,2-b]-pyrrole-2,5-dione (isoDPP)20–22 except that an additional benzene ring is present in the core. BDPs are also similar to benzodifuranones except that the lactone units of BDF are replaced by N-alkylated or N-acylated lactam units. Due to N-alkylation the solubility of the BDP derivatives is enhanced. The diphenyl-substituted 1,5-BDP 8 belongs to the high-performance pigments, and exhibits a broad UV/vis absorption maximum between 452 and 470 nm with an extinction coefficient of 42800 L mol−1 cm−1. 8 is prepared in three steps as first reported by Greenhalgh et al. (Scheme 8).8,9 According to a recent crystal structure analysis of the N,N′-dimethylated BDP derivative of 8, the core chromophore is fully planar as in isoDPP, which ensures full conjugation.23 Monomers based on BDP are readily soluble in common organic solvents, which renders them suitable for Pd-catalyzed polycondensation reactions such as Suzuki and Stille coupling,23 or Buchwald amination.12
 Scheme 8  Synthesis of 1,5-BDP derivative 8. 
In order to lower the band gap of BDP derivatives, it was tried to prepare thiophene-flanked BDPs instead of phenyl-substituted derivatives.24,25 Since the condensation reaction of p-phenylenediamine with α-hydroxy-thiopheneacetic acid turned out to be unsuccessful, alternative routes had to be worked out. The route described by Wudl et al.24 proceeds via the 3,7-dibromo-BDP, which is subsequently reacted with 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene in a Stille coupling reaction to yield the 3,7-bisthienyl-BDP 9. The synthesis proceeds through five steps with high yields up to 57% in each step (Scheme 9). Structural studies indicate that the bisthienyl-BDP 9 is more planar than its diphenyl analogue 8.24 The dihedral angle between the thiophene and BDP core is 12.7°, which is 25.3° smaller than for the diphenyl analogue. Moreover, the nearest molecular distance in 9 is 3.29 Å between thiophene and the six-membered ring in the core, which is much smaller than the 3.56 Å observed in 8. This indicates much stronger π–π interaction of the bisthienyl-BDP analogue. Consequently, the UV/Vis absorption maximum of 9 in solution is at 559 nm,24i.e., 101 nm red-shifted with regard to 8.

Another route to thienyl-flanked BDPs was described by Rumer et al.25 The synthesis proceeds via a bis-isatin derivative, which in three further steps including a two-directional Grignard reaction, a reduction using NaH2PO2/NaI/AcOH, and a selective oxidation with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (DDQ) is converted into the bis-thienyl-BDP derivative. The yield over the first three steps up to the bis-isatin intermediate is 69%, and 35% over the last three steps (Scheme 10).

Polymers
The first two BDP-polymers P11 and P12 were prepared upon Suzuki coupling of a symmetric di-N-alkylated 3,7-di(4-bromophenyl)-1,5-BDP derivative with 1,4-phenylene diboronic acid or 2,5-thiophene diboronester, respectively.23 Due to lactam N-alkylation of BDP with large 2-octyldodecyl groups, the polymers are easily soluble in common solvents such as chloroform or chlorobenzene. The maximum absorptions of P11 and P12 are located at 524 and 579 nm, respectively. P11 with 1,4-phenylene as comonomer unit exhibits a UV/vis absorption maximum of 538 nm in film, a low band gap of 1.9 eV, and a strong n-type behavior with a high electron mobility of 2.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. P12 with thiophene as comonomer unit exhibits a red-shifted absorption maximum of 579 nm, a lower band gap of 1.68 eV, and even higher electron and hole mobilities of 6.4 × 10−3 and 3.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.
The effect of lactam substitution of diphenyl-BDP with either alkyl or acyl groups on the LUMO energy levels of BDP-based polymers P13–16 was recently investigated.26 Compared with the N-alkylated BDP polymers, the N-acylated ones exhibit a reduction of the LUMO levels by about 0.3 eV, and an improved reversibility of the reductive doping. (Note that P15 exhibits the same chemical structure as P12 although their characteristic properties are very different (see Table 2). This may originate from the very different molecular weights of the two polymers.) N-acylation instead of alkylation is not limited to BDP building blocks, but may also apply to other chromophores carrying lactam units.

In a recent study it was tried to prepare BDP polymers with lower band gap by introducing alkylated imino groups in the main chain.12 Polymer P17 was prepared upon Pd-catalyzed Buchwald amination polymerization of a dialkylated dibromo-BDP derivative with a N,N′-dialkylated 1,4-phenylene diamine dihydrochloride. The polymer exhibits a deep blue color with a UV/vis absorption maximum at 628 nm, and an extinction coefficient of 26762 L mol−1 cm−1 in dichloromethane, the band gap is 1.45 eV. As already described for the related amino-BDF-based polymers P8–P10 the polymer is strongly solvatochromic.12 Furthermore, UV irradiation studies indicate that the polymer based on BDP is more stable than a related polymer with isoDPP although the structures of BDP and isoDPP are similar.12,21
Up to now there is only a single report on the preparation and study of devices based on a BDP-based polymer. Yue et al.27 reported the properties of solar cell devices fabricated with polymer P18 containing the diphenyl-BDP chromophore as acceptor unit and dithienopyrrole as donor unit. A power conversion efficiency of 2.6% was reported. The hole and electron mobilities of a blend film with PCBM cast from chlorobenzene solution were 2.0 × 10−5 and 2.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. They are much lower than for P12, for which hole and electron mobilities of 6.4 × 10−3 and 3.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, were reported.23
Using Stille coupling, Rumer et al.25 succeeded in the synthesis of novel D–A copolymers P19 and P20 consisting of dithienyl-BDT as electron acceptor, and thiophene or bisthiophene as donor units in alternating fashion. The UV/vis absorption of the two polymers covers the whole range from the visible to the near-infrared region (NIR) of 500 to 1100 nm with narrow optical band gaps of 1.03 and 1.17 eV, and deep LUMO energy levels of about −4.2 eV. P19 exhibits large hole and electron mobilities of 0.21 and 0.10 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while for P20 the hole and electron mobilities are 0.08 and 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This can be ascribed to the fact that P19 has a higher molecular weight (Mn: 34 kDa) than P20 (Mn: 5 kDa). Apart from this, the polymers exhibit a high thermal stability with a weight loss of 5% above 400 °C, which resembles polymers based on diphenyl-BDP. The results indicate that the use of thiophene-flanked BDP as acceptor comonomer is a powerful strategy to create new polymers for photovoltaic applications. The same approach was also reported by Cui and Wudl.24 They prepared four D–A copolymers containing dithienyl-BDP as acceptor, and fluorene (P21), difluorene (P22), dithienosilole (P23), and dithienopyrrole (P24) as donor units. Suzuki and Stille coupling were used. The polymers exhibit UV/vis absorption maxima between 706 and 1021 nm, and optical band gaps between 1.27 and 0.79 eV depending on the electron donating ability of the donor units. The LUMO levels of the four polymers were estimated to be as low as about −3.80 eV, which indicates a strong electron withdrawing capability making the polymers useful as acceptors in organic photovoltaics. Unfortunately, no information is available yet on electronic devices based on their dithienyl-BDP-based polymers.
4. Naphthodifuranones
Small molecules and monomers
The naphthodifuranone (NDF) structure is similar to BDF except that in the core chromophore of NDF an additional benzene ring is present. It increases the length of the conjugated π-system and causes a bathochromic shift of the absorption. NDF was first described by Carey et al. in 1984.28 The synthetic route to NDF is similar to BDF except that one of the dihydroxynaphthalene isomers instead of 1,4-dihydroxybenzene is used. Among the various dihydroxynaphthalene isomers, 2,3- and 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene are preferred26,30 because they lead to unique condensation products denoted as 1,10- and 1,6-NDF, respectively (Scheme 1). With other dihydroxynaphthalene isomers such as 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene a mixture of isomeric condensation products is obtained, which has to be separated in time-consuming and difficult chromatographic procedures.
1,10-Naphthodifuranones
Condensation of 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene with mandelic acid leads to the 1,10-NDF-compound 10 in a high yield of 54.5% (Scheme 11).28 Despite of the π-extended chromophore, 10 exhibits a yellow color with a UV/vis absorption maximum at 420 nm in chloroform.9 Starting from 4-bromomandelic acid, the symmetrical monomer 11 could be prepared,29 which upon Stille coupling with 2-tributylstannyl-4-octylthiophene and subsequent bromination with NBS was converted into monomer 12. In addition, the unsymmetrical, yellow monomer 13 was prepared (Fig. 2).21
 Scheme 11  Synthesis of 1,10-NDF compound 10. 
 Fig. 2  Molecular structures of 1,10-NDF monomers 11–13. Photographic images of the monomer solutions in dichloromethane are also shown (from ref. 29 and 21). 
The three monomers exhibit yellow and red colors in solution. As the crystal structure analysis of monomer 1129 indicates, the molecules exhibit a rather large torsional angle between the 1,10-NDF core and the phenyl units of about 42°, i.e., the phenyl units are little coplanar with the NDF core (Fig. 3). Consequently the intermolecular stacking distance is large and gives rise to only weak π–π interaction between adjacent core chromophores.29 This may explain the unfavourable hypsochromic shift of the absorption of 1,10-NDF compared with 1,8-BDF derivatives. Nevertheless, the additional benzene ring extremely enhances the photostability of 1,10-NDF in UV light, as well as the solubility in common organic solvents.

1,6-Naphthodifuranones
In their paper from 1984, Carey et al.28 also described the synthesis of the 1,6-NDF-compound 14. According to their studies the reaction of 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene and mandelic acid in boiling trichlorobenzene for 15 hours proceeds in a high yield of 49%, and free of any side products (Scheme 12). Compared with 1,5-BDF or 1,10-NDF, the UV/vis absorption of 1,6-NDF 14 is more than 120 nm red-shifted, the maximum appearing at 555 nm in chloroform.30 The red-shift originates from the additional benzene ring, which is inserted in the core of the molecule extending the π-chromophore. This is quite different from 1,10-NDF, in which the additional benzene unit is only attached to the core chromophore. Thus the π-chromophore of 1,6-NDF is more extended, planar and exhibits a larger effective conjugation length. The disadvantage of this chromophore is its rather poor solubility in common organic solvents. Therefore Hallas and Yoon30,31 synthesized a series of symmetrically and unsymmetrically substituted 1,6-NDF-derivatives 15 with different substitution patterns of the phenyl groups (Fig. 4). The alkoxy groups were found not only to improve the solubility, but also to give rise to a bathochromic shift of the absorption due to the electron donating effect of the substituents. They also found that the symmetrically substituted 1,6-NDF exhibit a hypsochromic color shade (turquoise color) and less build-up on polyester compared with the unsymmetrically substituted ones (neutral blue color). Based on their observations the well soluble 1,6-NDF-based monomer 16 with bromine functional groups was recently synthesized, which was also used for polymerization.32

5. Naphthofuranonepyrrolones and naphthodipyrrolidones
Naphthofuranonepyrrolones (NFPs) such as 17 can be prepared upon condensation of 1-amino-5-hydroxynaphthalene with appropriate derivatives of mandelic acid such as 4-propoxymandelic acid (Scheme 13a and b).30,31 The target compound is only obtained in poor yield of about 15%, while the reaction does not proceed with mandelic acid itself. The dyeing properties of 1,6-NFP are similar to the symmetrically disubstituted 1,6-NDF, but the color is a duller turquoise blue.

Symmetrical 1,6-NDP-derivatives can be synthesized upon condensation of 1,5-diaminonaphthalin with mandelic acid. The synthesis of the dibromo-substituted monomer 18 is outlined in Scheme 14.32 The UV/vis absorption of 1,6-NDP is similar to 1,6-NDF. The advantage of 1,6-NDP is that the solubility can be increased upon N-alkylation of the lactam units. The crystal structure of 1,6-NDP derivative 18 is shown in Fig. 6.32 The molecules adopt an intermolecularly slipped π–π stacking, the shortest distance being 3.38 Å. This is slightly shorter than for 1,5-BDP (3.56 Å).24 The torsional angle between the phenyl substituent and the 1,6-NDP core is 24.9°, i.e., clearly smaller than for 1,5-BDP. This indicates that the 1,6-NDP-chromophore is much more planar than 1,5-BDP, which favors a large π-conjugation.

6. NDF- and NDP-based polymers
Polymers based on 1,10-NDF
Up to now, only few reports on naphthodione-based polymers are available yet. Recently monomers 11–13 were used for polymerization using Pd-catalyzed Suzuki and Stille coupling.29 The structures of polymers P25–P28 are shown in Fig. 5. The polymers with molecular weights up to 30.9 kDa exhibit yellow, orange and red colors, the UV/vis absorption maxima are between 464 and 522 nm in solution. Extinction coefficients are between 1.1 and 3.9 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1.

 Fig. 6  Crystal structure of 1,6-NDP-based monomer 18 (taken from ref. 32). 
The polymers are extremely stable to UV light and only exhibit a weak fluorescence. For P26 the fluorescence quantum yield is 0.02% only. Among the polymers, P28 is the only one containing an unsymmetrically substituted 1,10-NDF chromophore.16 Its UV/vis absorption maximum in dichloromethane is at 464 nm, i.e., 20 nm blue-shifted with regard to P25 containing the symmetrical 1,10-NDF chromophore. A quantum chemical calculation indicated that the blue-shift is due to a large torsional angle of the methoxy-substituted phenyl groups with regard to the core chromophore.16
Polymers based on 1,6-NDF and 1,6-NDP
While any report on polymers based on 1,6-NFP is still missing, a first study on polymers based on 1,6-NDF (P29) and 1,6-NDP (P30) is already available.32 The molecular structures are shown in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Molecular structures of polymer P29 and P30. Photographic images of solutions of P29 in trichlorobenzene and P30 in dichloromethane are also shown. 
The 1,6-NDF-based polymer P29 exhibits a dark green color and is moderately soluble in common organic solvents. The UV/vis absorption maxima in trichlorobenzene and as thin film are at 644 and 692 nm, respectively. The 1,6-NDP-based polymer P30 is readily soluble in common organic solvents forming blue solutions. UV/vis absorption maxima in dichloromethane and as thin film are at 615 and 678 nm, respectively. The two polymers exhibit low HOMO and LUMO levels, narrow band gaps (1.30 eV for P29, and 1.41 eV for P30), and a broad UV/vis absorption ranging from 400 to 1000 nm (Table 3). Because of their broad and strong absorption in the visible and the low band gaps, the polymers are potentially useful for solar cell applications. However, any relevant studies are not available yet.

7. Structure–property relationships
The high performance pigments such as benzodiones and naphthodiones are similar in structure. Although all the compounds exhibit electron-deficient properties, the optical and electronic properties of the polymers containing the relevant chromophores are very different. Compared with the structure of 1,5-BDF or 1,5-BDP, there is an additional benzene ring in the core of 1,6-NDF or 1,6-NDP, which highly enlarges the π-extension and also enhances the planarity between the phenyl substituent groups and the core chromophore. This causes that the UV/vis absorption of the polymers based on 1,6-NDF or 1,6-NDP is strongly red shifted compared with the ones containing 1,5-NDF or 1,5-NDP. Compared with the 1,8-BDF-based compounds the additional benzene ring attached to the core of 1,10-NDF causes a blue shift of the absorption of the corresponding monomers and polymers. The reason might be that the additional benzene ring decreases the planarity of the backbone, which plays a key role in the UV/vis absorption. Apart from this, the additional benzene ring increases the photostability of the compounds in the UV-light.
The lactam units of the benzo- or naphthodipyrrolidone core can be easily alkylated, which renders the monomers and polymers highly soluble in common organic solvents, while the monomers and polymers based on benzo- or naphthodifuranone are rather insoluble or only moderately soluble. In order to enhance the solubility of the monomers and to render them suitable for polymerization, it is recommended to either synthesize unsymmetrically substituted BDF derivatives or to add methoxy groups to the phenyl rings attached to the NDF core.
The thienyl-flanked BDP-based monomers are more planar than the phenyl-flanked ones, which can be ascribed to the fact that the thienyl unit is much smaller. Since the thienyl unit also belongs to the electron-rich units, a D–A system is created in the thienyl-flanked BDP monomer shifting the absorption of this chromophore much more to the red than is the case for the phenyl-flanked one. The polymers based on thienyl-flanked BDP exhibit an even stronger red-shift up to the infrared and smaller band gaps compared with polymers based on phenyl-flanked BDP.
8. Conclusions
Recent studies indicate that DPP-related chromophores such as benzodifuranone (BDF) and –dipyrrolidone (BDP), and naphthodifuranone (NDF) and –dipyrrolidone (NDP) can be used as monomers for preparation of deeply colored polymers with low band gap. Pd-catalyzed Suzuki and Stille coupling, and electrochemical oxidation were used for polymerization. Most of the studies are concerned with BDF- and BDP-containing conjugated polymers, while NDF- and NDP-based polymers are not yet studied in great detail. BDF-based polymers are readily soluble, if they contain unsymmetrically substituted BDF, or N-alkylated amino-BDF units in the main chain, while for BDP-based polymers no solubility problem exists provided that the BDP lactam units are N-alkylated. All BDF- and BDP-based polymers exhibit a very strong and broad absorption in the visible, the absorption maxima being strongly dependent on the substitution of the chromophore, and the presence of D–A interactions in the main chain. Polymers with thiophene-flanked BDP, or imino-BDF units in the main chain the absorption maxima of thin films are clearly above 700 nm causing low LUMO levels and low band gaps of 0.8 to 1.2 eV. Presently available data indicate high electron and hole mobilities up to 0.21 and 0.10 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, suggesting applications of the polymers in ambipolar field effect transistors. A first study on solar cell devices containing the phenyl-BDP polymer P18 indicates a PCE-value of 2.6%, which might be exceeded if a polymer containing thiophene-flanked BDP units is used.
Several isomeric NDF and NDP derivatives are imaginable, but up to now only the 1,10-NDF, 1,6-NDF and 1,6-NDP isomer were accessible as sole products upon condensation of the respective dihydroxynaphthalene and mandelic acid derivatives. While 1,10-NDF-based polymers exhibit yellow to red colors, the corresponding 1,6-NDF- and 1,6-NDP-based polymers are blue or green with absorption maxima at 680 to 690 nm as thin films. Structure studies indicate that the phenyl-flanked 1,10-NDF is poorly π-conjugated because a large torsional angle between the phenyl group and the core chromophore exists. In contrast, the phenyl-substituted 1,6-NDP exhibits a planar, conjugated structure with short π–π stacking distance of 3.38 Å, which might be the origin for the different optical behavior. Thiophene-substitution of NDF or NDP monomers might shift the polymer absorption even further to the red. The recent studies indicate that especially the imino-BDF-,12 thienyl-substituted BDP-,24,25 and the phenyl-substituted 1,6-NDF- and 1,6-NDP-based polymers32 exhibit a broad and strong absorption in the visible extending to the infrared, reversible oxidation and reduction behavior, low LUMO levels, and low band gaps. Clearly further studies are necessary to investigate the interesting optical and electrochemical properties of the polymers, and to elucidate the application potential for electronic devices.
