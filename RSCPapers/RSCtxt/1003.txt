    , Accepted 8th September 2022First published on 10th September 2022AbstractTo facilitate the large-scale deployment of the adsorption-based gas separation technique, the integration of adsorbents derived from laboratories with gas–solid contactors in the industrial system should be considered. Compared to the conventional method to pack the adsorbent powder into the reaction bed, the strategies of shaping materials into structured adsorbents and utilizing gas–solid contactors with advanced architectures present improved efficiency and attract increasing attention. The reduced gas flow pressure drop and the increased thermal and mass transfer performance contribute to cutting down the operation energy consumption. To this end, this paper reviews the recent advances in the shaping process for adsorbents. First, the alternative geometric forms of structured adsorbents are introduced, and key metrics for structured adsorbent evaluation are summarized. Then, the effects of textural and geometric properties are discussed. Next, the typical steps and characteristics of the main techniques for adsorbent shaping are elaborated. The gas separation performance of structured adsorbents is compared. Further, from a practical point of view, the routes to integrate these structured adsorbents into suitable gas–solid contactors, as well as the corresponding cyclic processes and operation strategies, are discussed briefly. It is concluded that shaping techniques should be appropriately adopted according to the adsorbent properties, and the structure of the adsorbent should be designed according to the application requirements.

1. Introduction
Gas separation processes, focused on concentrating raw materials into higher-value products (extraction), or removing impurities from a bulk gas (purification),1,2 play an indispensable role in the world's manufacturing industries. These processes include carbon capture, biogas upgrading, natural gas desulfurization, hydrogen purification, volatile organic compound (VOC) removal, dehumidification, etc.3,4 Among various separation technologies, adsorption-based gas separation is considered to be more energy-efficient and thus shows great potential in the development of the low-carbon industry.5
To promote effective separation, a large number of gas separation units with improved performance and reduced cost need to be constructed. The efficiency of a gas separation system is strongly dependent on the material performance, process design, and device structure. Current studies have extensively explored the selectivity, capacity, and kinetics of adsorbents,6,7 while their loading pattern and cyclic operation in scaled-up devices are less discussed. Typically, adsorbents are synthesized in powder form and simply packed into reaction beds for gas separation. It is feasible for tests under laboratory condition but not effective in industrial applications, because the dense package in beds result in considerable pressure drop and significant heat and mass transfer resistance when the device size is enlarged.8 To this end, adsorbent shaping techniques have been utilized to transform powder materials into structured adsorbents.9 These structured adsorbents with customized three-dimensional forms can be readily applied in gas separation devices to provide favorable gas–solid contacts and improved adsorption/desorption properties. It is necessary to coordinate the structure of the adsorbent, contactor, and device with each other, based on which a suitable cycle process should be determined, thus achieving the optimal synergistic effect on gas separation. Adsorbent shaping involves the coupling of material chemistry and engineering mechanics, whereas there is still a lack of thorough understanding of technical routes to synthesize structured adsorbents with desirable adsorption performance and robust mechanical properties. To facilitate the wide range of applications of gas separation, investigations on the geometric structuring of adsorbents are indispensable.
Up to now, lots of details about the shaping techniques have been revealed. However, the related studies are concerned with various types of structured adsorbents with distinct features, and there is little literature that has compared and summarized them. Rezaei et al.10 discussed the alternate adsorbent configurations and the role of geometric parameters in the structured adsorbent overall performance. Relations between the gas–solid contactor topology and the gas separation behavior were identified, while the structured adsorbent manufacturing methods received less focus. Soltani et al.11 provided a review on monolith honeycomb structures. Honeycombs made of different materials were discussed, but only extrusion and coating fabrication methods were included. Akhtar et al.12 explored the structuring of zeolites, metal–organic frameworks, activated carbons, and alumina phosphates into adsorbents or catalysts. The use and limitations of inorganic binders in the powder shaping process are described. DeWitt et al.13 discussed the manufacture, characterizations, and modeling methods of monolith and fiber sorbents. Critical needs to further improve their performance were provided. A recent review by Lawson et al.8 systematically summarized the advances in 3D printing of structured adsorbents and catalysis. It was revealed that the additive manufacturing method is an invaluable technique to shape porous materials for use in a wide variety of separation and reaction applications, though for commercialization, there are still significant barriers that need to be overcome. To our knowledge, no review has currently comprehensively summarized the adsorbent shaping techniques and structured adsorbent characteristics. To this end, this paper introduces various forms of structured adsorbents. They are classified by fabrication techniques and compared regarding their gas separation performance. The key metrics affecting their adsorption properties are analyzed, and characterization methods for structured adsorbents are summarized. Furthermore, the strategies to integrate structured adsorbents into gas–solid contactors are illustrated and critical research suggestions for future development are provided.
2. Development of structured adsorbents for gas separation
2.1 Viable geometric structures of adsorbents
Naturally, the adsorbents exist in the form of powder. Preliminary shaping techniques, pelletization and granulation, transform them into pellets and granules. Though the gas flow pressure drop can be reduced compared to powder materials, they are still packed into fixed or fluidized beds for adsorption, leading to a limited improvement in gas diffusion. As such, adsorbents in other forms have been utilized, which include the honeycomb, fiber, foam, laminate, membrane, cylinder, and cuboid (Fig. 1). In literature, structured adsorbents are often generally mentioned as monoliths. A monolith is the uni-body with a specific geometric structure,14 so it can specifically refer to the honeycomb, foam, cylinder, or cuboid.
 Fig. 1  Viable geometric structures of shaped adsorbents. 
A honeycomb monolith has plenty of small and parallel microchannels running axially through the part.15 The cross-section of the honeycomb is typically circular and square, while the cross-section of the microchannel can be sinusoidal, circular, square, triangular, and trapezoidal.16,17 The pitch and wall thickness of the microchannels are dependent on the gas separation conditions, mostly within the range of 1–5 mm. They are also described as cells per square inch (cpsi), and the cpsi of honeycomb monoliths in CO2 capture is typically between 50–3000.10 The cpsi and shape of the microchannel determine the surface area of the honeycomb. The honeycomb can be synthesized as the adsorbent itself (typically by extrusion), or it can be used as a substrate to support the adsorbent attached by coating or growth. When used as a substrate, the honeycomb is typically made of ceramic, metal, and fiber paper.
The fiber is a structure with a significantly larger length than its diameter.18,19 They are mostly synthesized by the spinning method, and typically contain organic polymers. Adsorbents are embedded into fibers and achieve uniform dispersion inside. Fibers have porous outer skin, allowing the outside gas to diffuse freely into its interior and be captured by adsorbents. In addition to high mechanical strength, fibers have good flexibility, so they can be easily deformed to accommodate a variety of arrangements. In a typical gas separation pattern, bundles of fibers are aligned parallel to the direction perpendicular to the gas flow. Moreover, they can be woven into fiber mats and used as filters.
The foam is typically made of metal or ceramic in casting and foaming processes.20,21 It has a network structure of interconnected solid structs that builds cavities communicating with each other through pore windows. Its main characteristic is the window size, which is typically expressed as “pores per inch” (ppi). The window size of commercial foams is mostly between 5 and 100 ppi.22 Compared to honeycomb monoliths with only axial microchannels, foams have a three-dimensional pore structure with a higher surface area, allowing component mixing in both axial and radial directions. The tortuous flow paths result in turbulence in pores, so the heat and mass transfer are enhanced.
The laminate is a whole by superimposing and thermocompression bonding of two or more layers of polymer-impregnated substances. It is typically produced upon inert support such as metal foil, woven wire mesh, and woven glass fiber mesh.23 To improve its mechanical strength, binders are typically incorporated into the layers. Laminates are usually arranged in parallel.24 The performance of laminates is closely related to the layer thickness and interlayer spacing. Thin layers and smaller spacing increase the adsorbent loading but also result in increased pressure drop and manufacturing difficulty. The extended durability and superior cycle frequency give it unique advantages in gas separation applications.
The membrane, cylindrical, and cuboid monoliths are usually fabricated by casting.25,26 They have high adsorbent contents and thus generally exhibit relatively good adsorption properties. However, due to their relatively simple structure, their improvement in heat and mass transfer may also be limited.
2.2 Key metrics for structured adsorbents and their test methods
Evaluation criteria are needed to assess the material performance objectively. Structured adsorbents are first and foremost adsorbents, so they have all the evaluation criteria of conventional adsorbents. Besides, structured adsorbents have extra metrics related to engineering applications because they have been processed into a certain shape and loaded into practical devices. These metrics are shown in Fig. 2, and the details about them are described as follows.
 Fig. 2  Key metrics for structured adsorbents. 

2.2.1 Conventional metrics. 
Conventionally, the adsorbent evaluation metrics have been extensively discussed. To achieve efficient gas separation, adsorbents are compared in the following aspects.6,27 (a) Selectivity. In the multi-component atmosphere, the adsorbent should capture the target gas selectively to realize effective separation. (b) Capacity. In a single cycle, the adsorbent should capture the target gas as much as possible to minimize the device volume. (c) Adsorption and desorption rate. The adsorbent should reach adsorption equilibrium quickly during the adsorption stage, and also rapidly release the gas it captured during the regeneration stage, so as to shorten the cycle time and increase the process productivity. (d) Heats of adsorption. The adsorbent should have moderate heats of adsorption, because ultralow adsorption heats indicate weak binding to the adsorbate, while ultrahigh adsorption heats lead to increased regeneration energy consumption and significant temperature fluctuations for the adsorption process. (e) Stability. The adsorbent should keep stable in multiple adsorption/desorption cycles, and they should not be deteriorated by impurities in the atmosphere, such as water vapor, SOx, and NOx. (f) Manufacture capital. The adsorbent should be cost-effective, so it can be applied in a wider range.


2.2.2 Gas flow behavior. 
Structured adsorbents are loaded in gas–solid contactors for use. When the size of the gas–solid contactor is enlarged to the industrial level, the disturbance of the adsorbent structure on the gas flow may be more significant, which manifests itself in two ways: the gas pressure drop and the mass transfer.
The existence of the pressure drop indicates that the pressure distribution of the structured adsorbent is not uniform. This leads to the difference in the pressure change in different locations of the structured adsorbent in pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) cycles, and thus the adsorption and desorption behaviors are altered. Furthermore, the pressure drop quantifies the flow resistance when the gas flow passes through the structured adsorbent. A high pressure drop indicates that the gas flow is seriously blocked and an apparent energy loss of the fan blowing was caused, which reduces the system efficiency. In general, the pressure drop for honeycombs is between 20–500 Pa cm−1, while that for packed pellets is between 100–10000 Pa cm−1.28,29 Experimentally, the pressure drop can be measured by setting pressure sensors at the inlet and outlet of the fluid. In the simulation, there are series of correlations that describe the pressure drop.30–32
The adsorbent structure affects the mass transfer that is strongly related to the system separation efficiency. The system performance can be reduced by the mass transfer resistance and axial dispersion. The effect of mass transfer resistance is more pronounced at larger gas flow rates and faster cycles because the adsorption time scale becomes comparable to the cycle time under such conditions.10 In this case, the adsorption is switched to the next state when it is far from equilibrium, which is unacceptable because of the low adsorbent utilization rate. Obviously, the adsorbent structure needs to be optimized to improve the mass transfer effect. In general, kinetic models are established through adsorption curves or breakthrough curves, and then the mass transfer rate is evaluated according to the mass transfer coefficients that include the length of the mass transfer zone (MTZ), the rate constant, and the height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP), etc.30,33,34 It has been pointed out that mass transfer coefficients for structured adsorbents are typically 5–10 times larger than that for pellets and granules.28,35,36


2.2.3 Thermal management. 
Ideally, the adsorbent temperature is equal to the set temperature and achieves uniform distribution. However, in practical applications, owing to the heat resistance, particularly for materials with low thermal conductivity, the heat cannot be instantaneously conducted and there is a temperature gradient at different locations. In addition, the adsorption is exothermic and the desorption is endothermic. These heats could also bring in temperature fluctuations. The non-ideal temperature profile in actual processes could reduce the working capacity, deform the breakthrough curve, and decrease the separation efficiency.37 Furthermore, stress changes induced by excessive temperature differences may cause the adsorbent to detach from the substrate and reduce its service life. To prevent the detrimental effects of non-uniform temperature distribution, it is necessary to optimize the structure of the adsorbent and achieve effective thermal management. The temperature changes during the separation process can be monitored by setting temperature sensors at different locations inside the adsorption bed. There are also heat transfer models that simulate temperature contour plots and calculate effective heat transfer coefficients.38–40 Typically, the heat transfer coefficients for structured monoliths are 2–10 times larger than that for pellets.37,41,42


2.2.4 Mechanical strength. 
When the adsorbent is installed and used, the compression, tension, and friction may cause the collapse of the structure. In the case of attaching the adsorbent to the substrate, continuous high-flow gas purging may lead to detachment of the adsorbent. In addition, the changes in temperature and humidity may also result in a structural deformation. All of the above factors require sufficient mechanical strength of the structured adsorbent to enable it to be used for a long period. As such, the elastic modulus of a material is examined to measure its mechanical strength. It has been reported that common monoliths can undertake 5–200 MPa stress.43–46 The adhesion of the adsorbent coating films to the substrate is tested by determining the weight loss after sonication of the monoliths in an ultrasound bath.47 Accelerated stability tests are performed to measure the stability of the adsorbent under harsh conditions (typically high temperature and humidity).48,49

2.3 Effects of textural and geometric characteristics on the gas separation performance

2.3.1 Effects of textural properties. 
Textural properties of materials include specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, thermal expansion rate, melting point, density, porosity, elastic modulus, particle size, and so on. The particle size and morphology of the porous solid have a significant impact on the performance of the shaped adsorbent. This is manifested in the application of various shaping techniques, especially for processes with powder-slurry-monolith transitions. For 3D printing shaping, the particle size affects the rheological properties of the adsorbent “ink”. The particle size should be within a certain range, on the one hand to avoid blocking the printing tip, and on the other hand to allow interfacial bonding of the rheological solvent with other additives. The suitable size ranges may vary for different adsorbents, and Lawson et al. stated that an approximate particle size range for formulating printable slurries is <300 μm.8 Similar effects occur during the extrusion shaping process, where particle size will affect the rigidity of the extrudate and the consistency of the content.50,51 The spinning process also involves the preparation of dope, so it is also affected by the size of the adsorbent particles. It is assumed that larger particle size could bring about larger internal mass diffusion resistances during adsorption and desorption, so smaller particles are preferred.52 There are also corresponding effects in the coating process. When the particle size is too large, the adsorbent will not be well dispersed in the coating solution, and the adsorbent is prone to sedimentation, resulting in uneven coating films or weak bonding between the film and substrate. Regarding different shaping techniques and adsorbents, currently the most suitable particle size methods are mostly determined by empirical tests, and there is no generic theoretical guidance. Therefore, it is recommended in this paper to reveal the relationship between particle size and structured adsorbent performance according to the shaping principle and the physical and chemical properties of the material, so as to better design and implement future formulation processes.
In the aspect of thermal management, the heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and thermal expansion rate affect the separation performance. A smaller heat capacity indicates that the same amount of heat could cause larger temperature variation,10 while a smaller thermal conductivity results in larger temperature fluctuation at different locations of the contactor. A high thermal expansion rate could lead to a significant volume difference when working at alternated temperatures, which will bring large thermal stress and detrimental effects to the structure stability. In terms of durability, the elastic modulus of the material influences on the mechanical strength of the resulted structured adsorbent. The material water resistance determines whether the structured adsorbent can be applied in a highly humid environment. The thermal stability is dependent on the material's melting point. As for the adsorption performance, the material density affects the adsorption capacity per unit volume, and thus the compactness of the contactor. When the substrate material is porous, it can generally contain more active adsorbent components than the non-porous substrate. Moreover, physical adsorption of the gas could occur in the porous material.
The influence of textural characteristics is divided into two cases. One case is that the structured adsorbent mostly consists of the inert substrate, the other case is that the structured adsorbent mostly contains the active adsorbent component. In the former and later case, the textural characteristics of the substrate and the active adsorbent component play a major role, respectively. Take the former case as an example: in this situation, the active adsorbent is typically attached to the substrate by coating and growth method, and the substrate is typically a honeycomb monolith. The honeycomb can be made of ceramic, metal, and fiber paper. Table 1 shows the typical physical parameter ranges of these materials. Ceramics, such as cordierite and mullite, have a lower thermal expansion rate, moderate heat capacity, high mechanical strength, and ultrahigh thermal and chemical stability, so they can be used in a wide range of gas separation scenarios. Metal substrates including alumina, stainless steel, and copper, are also very stable. Their unique characteristic is the high thermal conductivity, so they are usually used to relieve the effects of temperature maldistribution. Fiber paper substrates are in common use in desiccant wheels. They have low density and high porosity, so more adsorbents can penetrate their interior and make them have higher adsorption capacity per unit mass. However, they have lower mechanical strength and tend to deteriorate in the vapor atmosphere.

For structure adsorbents mostly composed of active adsorbent components, studies related to the effects of textural properties have been reported. Menard et al.59 prepared an activated carbon monolith with intensified overall thermal conductivity (10 W m−1 K−1) and tested its CO2 adsorption under both conditions of non-isothermal and non-adiabatic. By comparing with commercial granular adsorbents with thermal conductivity of 0.15–0.5 W m−1 K−1, conductive packing achievements for the monolith were demonstrated with reduced adsorptive thermal effects. In the study of Rezaei et al.,43 the porosities of 3D-printed zeolite monoliths were regulated by varying the additive type and concentration. It is observed that the monolith with higher porosity showed reduced mass transfer zone length and increased adsorption capacity. Extruded monoliths with high electrical conductivity enable electrical swing adsorption (ESA) which is a process assumed to be more effective than traditional temperature swing adsorption (TSA) processes because energy is directly delivered to the adsorbent with higher heating efficiency.60 This concept has been verified by mixing zeolites and activated carbons to prepare electrically conductive composites in some case studies.61–63


2.3.2 Effects of geometric parameters. 
As with all structured adsorbents, they have (equivalent) length, width, and height, and these geometric parameters describe their size. In addition, for honeycombs and foams, geometric parameters also include the pore size and wall thickness (or described as cpsi and ppi) and the pore shape of the microchannel. For laminates, the geometric parameters also include the spacing between them. For fibers, geometric parameters refer to their diameter and length. The geometric configurations of the structured adsorbent affect the pressure drop, mass and heat transfer, and mechanical strength. Thus, the process indicators such as recovery, productivity, energy consumption, and capital cost are dependent on these factors. To achieve efficient separation, the influence pattern of these parameters should be investigated.
Rezaei et al.28 developed an analytical method based on numerical models to determine the optimum set of geometric parameters of structured adsorbents in terms of mass transfer, pressure drop, and adsorbent loading. Laminates, honeycombs, and foams were examined, and results were compared with that of pellets. It was found that pellet and foam had larger external surface areas. Honeycombs could have a larger surface area than foams when the cell density was very high, and laminate could have a larger surface area than pellets when the spacing was very small (Fig. 3(a)). Pellets resulted in the highest pressure drop than other structures. Besides, the pressure drops of honeycombs increased with the cell density (Fig. 3(b)). Foams had the longest mass transfer zone (MTZ), and laminates had the shortest (Fig. 3(c)). For honeycombs and foams, increased cell density led to sharper breakthrough shape, which indicated an enhanced mass transfer. Interestingly, in a recent study by Rezaei's team,43 an opposite pattern was reported for 3D-printed zeolite honeycomb monoliths. When the cell density of honeycomb increased from 200 to 600 cpsi, although the film mass transfer coefficient increased, the breakthrough fronts broadened because they were limited by molecular diffusion. Besides, increasing the cell density resulted in a gas throttling effect and CO2 residence time was reduced. This indicates that to improve the kinetics, the structured adsorbent itself should also have higher macro-porosity to overcome the intraparticle diffusional resistance. Moreover, it was observed that the mechanical strength of the honeycomb increased exponentially with cell density. In another study,37 they investigated the effect of structure on the thermal behavior of adsorbents in pressure swing adsorption (PSA) processes. It was found that for all structures, more significant temperature maldistributions appeared under the adiabatic condition and thus the breakthrough fronts were distorted. The increased cell density of structured adsorbents could mitigate this adverse effect (Fig. 3(d–f)). Under the adiabatic condition, pellets suffered most from the temperature maldistribution, while under the non-adiabatic condition, the heat transfer in laminates was the worst. Under both conditions, foam structure was good in dissipating the thermal effect. Also focusing on thermal management, Ritter et al.38 evaluated the effect of different parameters on effective radial thermal conductivity keff of a parallel channel corrugated metal honeycomb. It is revealed that the contact pattern between the flat and corrugated metal foil sheets resulted in significantly different temperature profiles of the metal honeycomb (Fig. 3(g and h)). As a result, the keff decreased sharply when there was a gas medium gap (δg > 0), but the further δg increase did not affect the thermal conductivity obviously. Furthermore, keff increased slightly when metal thickness δm increased (Fig. 3(i and j)).

The pore shape of the honeycomb was proven to have an important effect on the mass and heat transfer properties. Hassan et al.16 presented a comparative study to evaluate the dehumidification performance of honeycombs with square, circular, and triangular channels. The results show that the triangular channel provided the largest convective heat and mass transport and adsorbed 11% and 42% more water than circular and square channels, respectively. However, the average pressure drop for the triangular channel was 69% and 73.5% larger than that for square and circular channels, respectively. The geometry of the channel section was further studied by Narayanan et al.64 In addition to square, circular and triangular channels, they examined the shape of rhombic, hexagon, sinusoidal, and rectangular. Again, the triangular channels exhibited the best dehumidification performance, followed by the sinusoidal and rectangular channels. The reason for this was assumed to be that they had smaller hydraulic diameters, so gas velocities in the channels were higher and resulted in enhanced heat transfer. The channel cross-sectional area along the axial direction can also vary, so Sluijter et al.65 used a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to simulate the CO2 capture performance of five monoliths with different channel geometries. The cone-shaped geometry exhibited the sharpest breakthrough profile, indicating the least mass transfer resistance. Recently, Brandani et al.30 presented a procedure to derive the height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) for an arbitrary extruded monolith and validated it by 3D numerical simulations. It was revealed that monoliths with different geometries had different corrected thickness correlations, and their mass transfer patterns could be quantitatively described by the HETP expression.
Although the effects of channel shape and cell density have been extensively studied, there has been little analysis of scaling up the size of structured adsorbents. That is, whether the performance will be changed when their size is scaled up from laboratory-level to industrial-level. The results may be speculated by similar principles, but it is still necessary to confirm this pattern to improve the accuracy of techno-economic analysis in large-scale deployments. Therefore, more attempts in this regard are needed in future research.

2.4 Shaping techniques to fabricate structured adsorbents
Various processing routes have been adopted to produce structured adsorbents from porous powders. Some shaping techniques have been proposed very early, but the history of their applications in the field of gas separation is not long. Based on the results of the literature, the approximate time of the applications of different shaping techniques to adsorptive gas separation is plotted in Fig. 4 to show their evolution. It can be found that over time, the principles of shaping become more diverse and more complex structures can be fabricated.

2.4.1 Granulation and pelletization. 
As conventional techniques, granulation and pelletization have been widely applied to shape various types of adsorbents. Granulation is a process based on the size-enlargement of the material through powder aggregation.75 It can be performed by wet-spray, spray-dry, and coagulation bath techniques. During the wet-spray process, the powder adsorbents are wetted by the liquid and rolled in a cylindrical granulator (Fig. 5(a)). Driven by the impeller and chopper, they collide with each other and aggregate into spherical granules. The diameter of the granules can be tuned by adjusting the spray nozzle flow rate and the impeller speed.76 After the granules leave the granulator, they undergo subsequent sieving to ensure that the desired granule size is obtained. When a spray-dry technique is used, the mixed slurry of adsorbents and additives is sprayed from the upside nozzle, dried by the hot air and formed into spheres, and then collected at the lower end outlet (Fig. 5(b)).77 The coagulation bath technique utilizes a phase inversion process to form the adsorbent into spheres (Fig. 5(c)).78 Typically, adsorbents and additives are mixed in a solvent to form a slurry that is then added dropwise to the non-solvent. The slurry forms into spheres in the non-solvent coagulation bath due to surface tension, after which the spheres are separated from the non-solvent and dried, and the granule adsorbents are obtained. The addition of the binder increases the mechanical strength of granules, but also results in possible unfavorable effects on adsorption uptake.79,80 Therefore, a key issue associated with granulation is to preserve the physical and chemical properties of the original adsorbent as well as to provide sufficient mechanical stability.
 Fig. 5  Schematic diagrams of granulation: (a) wet-spray technique; (b) spray-dry technique; (c) coagulation bath technique; and (d) the schematic diagram of pelletization. 
Ren et al.81 produced spherical Zr-MOF adsorbents from powder using a wet spray method. The granules could be produced in a kilogram batch with 30 min operation time. The drop test and simulated tumbler drum test showed that there was only slight physical degradation of the granules after the simulated destructions, although decreased hydrogen storage capacity after the granulation was observed. Choe et al.77 presented a scalable synthesis method for Mg2(dobpdc) and its shaped beads, which are obtained by using a spray dry method after mixing Mg2(dobpdc) powders with alumina sol. The beads were then functionalized with N-ethylethylenediamine and coated with long alkyl chain silanes, and the resulted adsorbents exhibited a CO2 capacity of >11 wt% and high hydrophobicity. The same team later fabricated Mg2(dobpdc)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) composite beads via a solvent/non-solvent method, followed by the post-functionalization of 1-ethylpropane-1,3-diamine.78 Compared with the pristine powder, the diamine-grafted beads exhibited a superior long-term performance without structural collapse for up to 1 month. A similar phase inversion method was reported by Han et al.82 Millimeter-sized spherical silica foam supports were prepared using agar addition, foaming, and drop-in-oil method, and they were modified with PEI by a wet impregnation process. The spheres did not show a superior CO2 adsorption capacity than the particle-type adsorbent, but they had higher capacity per gram of PEI and strong stability. In addition to these, literature also reported the granulation of other types of metal organic frameworks (MOFs),83,84 zeolites,85 and organic polymers.86,87 In general, there are many specific embodiments of the granulation method, which can both reduce the adsorption capacity and impart new properties to the adsorbents to enhance their durability.
Pelletization is to place the powder adsorbent between two plates, and then applied a press that is typically several tens of MPa to the powder in the mold with a punch (Fig. 5(d)).88 The powder is consolidated due to intermolecular forces under strong compaction. The tightness of the bond is related to the amount of pressure applied, and in some cases, the binder is also incorporated to further strengthen the structure. Pelletization typically produces pellets in the shape of cylinders and cubic. A significant consideration is the deactivation of the material under strong pressing.89,90 Granted, this adverse influence varies between different materials, so the pressure and pressing rate should be determined according to the specific material properties and the effect of binder addition.
A typical study by Wadi et al.91 explored the formation of SBA-15 pellets. By varying the binder composition, the deteriorating effects on adsorption performance in the pelletization were minimized while adequate mechanical integrity was maintained. Regufe et al.92 developed activated carbon and zeolite hybrid pellets for CO2 electric swing adsorption. It was found that pellets with higher activated carbon contents exhibited lower CO2/N2 selectivity, but the pellet with only 30% activated carbon content was assumed to be not suitable for electric swing adsorption because heat regeneration is used and there is a percolation threshold limit. Zheng et al.93 used the polyvinyl butyral as a binder to shape ultramicroporous powder into pellets. PVB binder exhibited good compatibility and interaction with MOFs, affording up to 95% loading of MOFs. The shaping method showed slight influence on the adsorption capacity of C2H2, while greatly hindering the adsorption of C2H4. Thus, the C2H2/C2H4 selectivity of GeFSIX-2-Cu-i was increased by 35% from the original powder. Other pelletization cases are summarized in Table 3. These studies show that though pelletization caused the capacity decrease, the decrease can be relieved by optimizing the binder type and composition. Therefore, pellets with desirable adsorption performance can be obtained.

Indeed, granulation and pelletization have the advantages of simple manufacture, rapid production, and diversity in material incorporation, which make them readily applied in industrial conditions. However, they both result in millimeter-sized granules or pellets that are still packed into the fixed bed. Therefore, the problems of limited mass and heat transfer and excessive pressure drop cannot be well addressed.28 Probably they can be called “incomplete” molding processes, and for this reason, other shaping techniques have been proposed.


2.4.2 Coating. 
The coating is one of the most direct methods to combine the adsorbent with the structured substrate.11,12,99,100 A typical coating procedure is shown in Fig. 6(a). The coating begins with the adsorbent, solvent, and substrate preparation. After the adsorbent and the solvent are mixed, the mixture contacts the substrate to attach the adsorbent to the substrate. The substrate is then separated, and the excess solvent is blown off with high-pressure gas if necessary. The next step is to heat the substrate at 60–150 °C to remove the residual solvent. The coating and drying steps can be repeated to increase the adsorbent loading. To strengthen the bonding between the coating film and the substrate, calcination at 200–1000 °C is performed. However, for some organic adsorbents, no calcination is done to avoid organic decomposition.
 Fig. 6  (a) A typical procedure for coating methods, the dotted line indicates that this step can be omitted; (b) schematic diagrams of different coating methods. 
According to the coating procedure, the adsorbent, substrate, binder, and coating method are the main factors affecting the performance of resulted material. The goal of coating is to deposit adsorbents that are actually functional on the substrate, so the adsorbent type plays the key role in the adsorption properties. In more common cases, the adsorbents are synthesized as particles or powder, and mixed with the binder to form a coating solution. In other cases, the coating solution is the adsorbent synthesis intermediate. During the coating process, the adsorbent is synthesized by treatments like heating, calcination, and supercritical drying.101–104 This method generally brings about more uniform coating films. Up to now, various types of adsorbents have been coated to substrates, including zeolites,105 alumina,106 silica,107 carbon,101,108 carbonate,109 metal–organic frameworks,110 clay,111 organic polymers,112 and so on. The commonly used substrates are ceramic honeycombs,113,114 metal honeycombs,115,116 fiber paper,107 and polymer monoliths.117,118 The textural properties (detailed in Section 2.3.1) of these substrates are various, so the resulted structured adsorbents exhibited different performances. Among them, cordierite has been the most applied in studies because of its low thermal expansion rate, low thermal capacity, high chemical stability, and robust mechanical structure. Metallic supports have high thermal conductivity, but they present the disadvantage of being non-porous and having a flat and smooth surface where it is more difficult to anchor adsorbents.99,119,120 The fiber paper substrate has large pore volumes, so it allows more sorbents to penetrate its internal and the loading is increased. Binders are used to enhance the combination between the adsorbent and the substrate, typically simultaneously reducing the adsorption capacity. The main inorganic binders are colloidal silica (silica sol)44 and colloidal alumina,116,121,122 and organic binders are polyvinyl alcohol (PVA),115 hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC),123 polystyrene-block-polybutadiene-block-polystyrene (SBS),48 and silicone.124,125
The coating methods (Fig. 6(b)) have a strong influence on the film distribution on the substrate. Dip coating and wash coating are similar methods that refer to the steps to immerse the substrate in the suspension, then draw it out at a certain rate.113,121 They allow the substrate to be fully contacted with the coating solution, but they may cause pore blockage when the pore diameter is small and the coating solution is viscous and dense. Spray coating refers to spraying the adsorbent-containing solution on the substrate.104,112,126 It allows the operator to coat the locations where needed, but sometimes the curved and overlapping corners are hard to be reached. Flow coating is to pour the coating solution over the substrate and make the liquid be attached when it is flowing.127 By controlling the flow direction, the coating can be uniformly covered on the surface. Spin coating refers to the steps to make the material and solvent spin at high speeds, so the centripetal force and the surface tension of the liquid together create an even covering.128 The coating method should be selected reasonably according to the requirements of the adsorbent loading and distribution uniformity.
Recent studies have used different combinations of the above factors. Wu et al.44 synthesized amine-functionalized silica sol and attached it to the ceramic honeycomb by dip coating (Fig. 7(a)). During the heating process, the liquid silica sol gelatinized to form solid silica sol that penetrated into the internal and surface of the honeycomb. Thus, the CO2 structured adsorbent with uniform coating films and good stability was obtained. Using polystyrene-block-polybutadiene-block-polystyrene (SBS) as a binder, Chae et al.48 attached the diamine-grafted MOF to the surface of Ti mesh and air filter by spray coating. The incorporation of SBS reduced the adsorption capacity, but meanwhile also enhanced the adsorbent stability under humid conditions. Lee et al.129 used silicone oil for the liquid component and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for the solid nanoparticles to synthesize liquid-like adsorbents (LLA). The LLA was coated onto the filter mesh for indoor CO2 capture (Fig. 7(b)). Because the CNTs capture CO2 by physical adsorption, the adsorbent can be easily regenerated. Besides, the coating was proven to be hydrophobic and have a strong viscosity, so it can be used for a long time. Esmaeili et al.105 used acrylic latex emulsion as a binder to coat 13X powder on the fin tube heat exchanger. By altering the 13X content in the coating solution and coating times, the different coating film thickness was obtained. Results show that coated heat exchanger enabled CO2 capture in a shorter cycle time, and different coating thicknesses resulted in different CO2 adsorption energy efficiency with a maximum of less than 3%. Gao et al.112 synthesized nanogel particles (GPs) by a thermally initiated free-radical copolymerization and coated it onto carbon paper via a spray coating approach. To support the obtained material, a milli-channel reactor was used for CO2 capture under humid conditions. Results show that the kinetics of materials prepared by spray coating was significantly enhanced, and the capacity was higher than those of polyamine-impregnated carbon paper.

The coating method is also widely used in the field of dehumidification. Gkaniatsou et al.125 produced MOFs in batches, and used silicon as a binder to deposit 1.8 kg MIL-160 on the dehumidification heat exchanger by dip coating (Fig. 7(c)). The coated samples were dried and cured at 150 °C to obtain the optimal mechanical strength. No evident peeling of the coating layers was observed after multiple temperature swing cycles. Vivekh et al.130 mixed PVA, LiCl, and water to obtain a coating solution that was then attached to the fin tube heat exchanger by dip coating. By repeating the coating process, 50 g of desiccant could be attached to a heat exchanger with a size of 200 × 150 × 22 mm. After repeated TSA cycles, the desiccant kept being stably combined with the fins. Li et al.123 evaluated the role of binder in the performance of silica gel-embedded heat exchangers in terms of heat and mass transfer and water uptake characteristics. It was observed that inorganic binders exhibited poorer adhesive ability onto the fin surface, while one of the organic binders, hydroxyethyl cellulose was found to have strong bonding as well as higher surface area.
Theoretically, the coating method can produce structured adsorbents of any shape, because the substrate structure can be arbitrary as long as the coating films can be attached to its surface. The common forms are the honeycomb, mesh, and foam. The main advantages of the coating method lie in its simplicity and the possibility of supporting ready-made adsorbents. The procedure is time-saving and can be easily scaled up. However, the disadvantages of this method are that films are not rigidly bound to the substrate, and owing to the large weight percentage of the substrate, the overall capacity per unit mass is relatively low. Furthermore, attention should be paid to the mass transport limitations that may be caused by ununiform coating. Table 4 summarizes the main features of structured adsorbents synthesized by the coating method.

2.4.3 Growth. 
The growth method is to synthesize the goal materials on the surface of the substrate through chemical reactions. The goal materials on the surface are connected with the substrate by covalent anchoring. Typically, the seeds are deposited on the substrate surface, then they are processed under desired conditions to let the film growth occur (Fig. 8).131,132 Since the shape design of the substrate is flexible, structured adsorbents in a variety of forms, such as monoliths, fibers, and planar sheets, can be prepared. The advantages of the growth method include a strong bonding between the film and the substrate, high film uniformity, and tunability of membrane properties. However, there are also challenges that it is more difficult to be scaled up, and the synthesis process is typically not efficient and cost-effective enough. Common approaches to growing particles on the substrates are hydrothermal (or solvothermal) growth and layer-by-layer growth. In general, the choice of solvent in the reaction and seeding methods have been shown to be important in creating a uniform coating with strong adhesion to the substrate. Up to now, only the growth of zeolites133 and metal organic frameworks70,134 have been demonstrated to synthesize structured adsorbents.
 Fig. 8  A typical growth procedure for structured adsorbent synthesis: upper graph is the operation steps, and lower graph is the material reaction process. 
As an example, Mosca et al.135 grew NaX films on cordierite monoliths by a solvothermal method using a clear solution. The resulted films were dense and uniform with a very small amount of sediments adjacent to the film, so they are suitable for pressure swing adsorption of CO2. For a comparison study, Montes et al.115 deposited MFI-type zeolites on Fecralloy honeycomb monoliths by in situ growth method and washcoated zeolites method, respectively. It was found that both cases result in total covered support surface with a very adherent layer but the final textural properties were different. Washcoating produced a layer with zeolite crystals randomly oriented while in situ growth directed the crystal to a preferential orientation. Using NaX films that grew on cordierite monoliths, Rezaei et al.36,136 carried out thorough research to evaluate the efficacy of structured adsorbents in vacuum swing adsorption and pressure swing adsorption. In both cases, the structured adsorbents demonstrated superior adsorption performance than the powder analog. Later, the effects of wall porosity and zeolite film thickness on their dynamic adsorption behavior were investigated.136 In this study, monoliths were impregnated with colloidal alumina prior to film growth to minimize the growth of zeolite in the monolith wall pores. More recently, 13X films were grown on the steel monoliths by Hedlund et al.137 The CO2 adsorption breakthrough curves were measured, and it was found that the mass transfer resistance for the film is 2.2 times lower than that for zeolite 13X pellets. Besides, the steel monolith support provides good mechanical strength and excellent thermal conductivity for the 13X films.
The MOF growth has been extensively investigated in membrane separation,70,134,138 and the use of MOFs supported in the structured substrate as adsorbents is more recently explored. For the first time, Jones et al.132 explored the CO2 capture potential of mmen-Mg2(dobpdc) supported honeycomb monolith synthesized by in situ growth (Fig. 9(a)). The cordierite honeycomb is firstly wash-coated with alumina, then the Mg2(dobpdc) film was grown using MgO nanoparticles as the precursor (Fig. 9(b–d)). After being grafted by diamine, the monolith exhibited a CO2 uptake of 2.37 mmol g−1 and excellent cyclic adsorption/desorption performance. Not long later, Rezaei et al.139 reported the immobilization of MOF-74(Ni) and UTSA-16(Co) on commercial cordierite monolith via the in situ growth method. To control the crystal nucleation and growth, the solvothermal method and layer-by-layer method were optimized to improve the MOFs film properties. It was found that the choice of suitable procedure primarily depends on the type of MOF material used. Following this line of thought, they improved the synthesis process by growing MOF-74(Ni) and UTSA-16(Co) on the surface of Torlon-monolith composite adsorbent using a pre-seeding method. This seeding strategy eliminates the complexity of common growth procedures and results in higher MOF loading.140 Furthermore, they utilized 3D printing to the impregnated kaolin-based monolith with metal precursor Co, and then facilitate the UTSA-16 growth via a solvothermal synthesis approach.131 The Co weight loading in the kaolin support was varied to optimize the MOF growth. The obtained UTSA-16 monolith with 90 wt% loading exhibited significantly increased uptake and mechanical strength than previous materials.

The MOF growth on other substrates has also been demonstrated. Zhao et al.141 reported the rapid growth of MOFs enabled by the hydroxy double salt (HDS) intermediate formed in situ from thin films at room temperature (Fig. 9(e)). Using ZnO thin films deposited via atomic layer deposition, dense HKUST-1 coatings are grown onto fibers. Breakthrough tests showed that the MOF-functionalized fibers have a high adsorption capacity for NH3. Subsequently, Pimentel et al.142 synthesized ZIF-8 in polymer fibers by a similar method. Cellulose acetate/ZnO fibers were first spun via a dry-jet wet-quench method, then converted through hydroxy double salt intermediates into ZIF-8. The MOF loading within the sorbent reached 85 wt%, and this process was demonstrated on module-packaged fibers. Zhang et al.143 prepared fiber membrane by electrospinning where HKUST-1 was then grown in situ by hydrothermal method. A high MOF loading rate of 82 wt% was achieved and the resulted adsorbent showed a prominent CO2 adsorption capacity of 3.9 mmol g−1 and remarkable recyclability. Rezaei et al.144 achieved the growth of MOF-74 and USTA-16 on the surface of carbon hollow fibers produced by pyrolysis of cross-linked Torlon hollow fibers. Before the MOF/carbon composites fabrication, the carbon hollow fibers were functionalized to increase the surface hydroxyl groups. The results composites had 37–38% MOF loading with the film thickness of 10–15 μm, and they exhibited CO2 capacity of 1.2–2.0 mmol g−1 at room temperature and 1 bar. Zhen et al.145 proposed a strategy of SIFSIX-3-Cu growth into melamine formaldehyde sponge (MFS) monolith for CO2 capture. First, metal ions were introduced into the pores of melamine formaldehyde MFS monolith onto which inner walls a thin layer of PVA had adhered in advance, then organic ligands were introduced into the pores of MFS. The in situ MOFs growth in MFS effectively avoided crystals stack and presented a multi-level pore structure. Yang et al.146 used reported an approach to construct the MOF-on-metal structure where MIL-96 and MIL-100 were synthesized in situ on alumina sheets. The growth films were tightly bonded to the substrate surface, and exhibited an ultrahigh water adsorption capacity of 192.5 g m−2. This method enables the binder-free attachment of desiccant onto the heat exchanger.

Table 5 summarizes the main features of structured adsorbents synthesized by the growth method. Overall, the growth method is more dependent on the substrate than the coating method. The adsorbent loading is within the range of 1–40%, and only laboratory-scale cases have been reported so far. To promote the application of the growth method, it is necessary to develop more rapid, low-cost, and easily achievable synthetic schemes while maintaining the desirable adsorption performance.

2.4.4 Extrusion. 
Extrusion is a process to create structured adsorbents by pushing the paste through a die of the desired cross-section. A typical procedure of extrusion is shown in Fig. 10(a).62,148 Firstly, the paste containing the active component, binder, plasticizer, and other additives is prepared, followed by pre-drying. Then, the paste is put into the die and extruded by hydraulic, compressed air, or mechanical pressurization (Fig. 10(b)). Subsequently, the material is dried and calcined to form a robust monolith with a specific three-dimensional structure. In most gas separation cases, honeycombs are manufactured by the extrusion method,149,150 while other structures like hollow cubes, solid cylinders, and hollow cylinders are more used in catalysis.151,152 The size and shape of the product are determined by the mold, and only simpler structures with continuous channels can be manufactured by extrusion. Apparently, unlike the coating and growth method, no substrates are needed for extrusion, so the adsorbent loading of the extrudate can be significantly increased. One disadvantage of the extrusion method is that for different shapes of structured adsorbents, customized molds have to be produced to suit the extrudate configuration, which increases the capital cost and manufacture time.

Various types of materials can be shaped into monoliths via extrusion. Among them, zeolite monoliths have been the most investigated. Earlier research extruded zeolite 5A into monoliths in different shapes, and the effect of binder on the manufacture has been studied.154,155 It was found that critical factors in extrusion include the use of a binder with good plasticity properties, extrusion condition, and a well-controlled drying process. For performance improvement, Hasan et al.35 prepared a 5A zeolite monolith with a hierarchical designed channel/pore system and high zeolite content approaching 92 wt%. The developed monolith showed outstanding performance on CO2 separation from CO2/N2 mixtures compared to commercial 5A beads. In another case, zeolite 4A was shaped into a square-shaped honeycomb by a twin-screw extruder with methylcellulose as the binder.156 It was then used as the adsorbent for the separation of propane/propylene mixtures. To avoid the difficulties associated with the anchoring of crystalline zeolite to the monolith, the process parameters for the preparation of the H-ZSM-5 zeolite monolith by extrusion were optimized.157 As a result, the active phase was uniformly distributed throughout the monolith and the necessary steps for extrusion were reduced. By combining H-ZSM-5 with electrically conductive carbon, a hybrid monolith can be utilized for electric swing adsorption (ESA). During the synthesis designed by Masala et al.,62 the paste containing H-ZSM-5 and phenolic resin was extruded into a honeycomb that underwent carbonization to covert the phenolic resin into carbon. Another zeolite/carbon hybrid monolith was produced by Regufe et al.,61 but the synthesis was different. The zeolite 13X and activated carbon were mixed to form a slurry that was extruded with 15-ton pressure, dried at room temperature, and calcined. Rezaei et al.158 analyzed the dynamic CO2 capture over 13X zeolite monolith obtained from a commercial company in the presence of SOx, NOx, and humidity. It was found that in humid-contaminated mode, the monolith experienced improved CO2 uptake and reduced kinetics compared to that in dry-contaminated mode.
Due to the low cost, wide range of sources, and high microporosity, the activated carbon is suitable material for monolith extrusion. As an early attempt, Yates et al.159 conformed commercial activated carbon as open-channel honeycomb monoliths and tested their adsorption properties towards volatile organic compounds. In addition, they managed to control the porosity of the monolith by mixing activated carbon with mesoporous alumina and non-porous titania.160 The relationship between the textural properties and the adsorption behaviors was explored. A coal-derived activated carbon was utilized by Liu et al.161 to prepare extruded monolith. They evaluated the effect of carbonization temperature on the monolith properties, and found that higher carbonization temperature resulted in lower total pore volume and higher mechanical strength due to the formation of relatively less defective structure.
MOFs have advanced pore structure and highly adjustable chemical properties, so shaping them into monoliths for improved adsorption performance is of great interest. Kaskel et al.149 firstly fabricated MOFs monolith by extruding a slurry mixture of Cu3(BTC)2, methyl hydroxyl propyl cellulose, and methoxy functionalized siloxane ether. Compared with the cordierite monolith deposited by in situ growth Cu3(BTC)2, the extruded monolith showed a higher MOF loading, more uniform particle dispersion, and a more robust structure. Another study by Hong et al.162 manufactured MIL-101(Cr) monoliths by paste extrusion techniques from the synthesized MIL-101 (Cr) powder. The CO2 adsorption properties of the resulted monolith were determined from their sorption isotherms and adsorption breakthrough curves. Later, they performed the comparison between the MIL-101(Cr) extrude and zeolite 13X extrude, and found that the former have higher porosity and overall adsorption properties.148 To a great extent, MOF monolith can have better textural properties than the common materials, but it is noted that the calcination of MOF extrudate should be optionally performed because the ultrahigh temperature could degrade the MOF structure. Without calcination, the mechanical strength of the monolith could be adversely affected, so the balance between better adsorption performance and structure durability needs to be considered. Siliceous monoliths, alumina monoliths, and clay monoliths are also manufactured by extrusion for gas separation, but the related studies are relatively fewer.150,163–165
Extrusion is a more conventional method that produces high adsorbent-loading materials and can be easily utilized. Due to its relatively mature manufacturing process, it is still an alternative shaping technique. In addition to further optimizing the extrusion process for novel materials such as MOFs, further surface modification such as amine modification of extrudes can be considered to obtain desirable adsorbent. Table 6 summarizes the main features of structured adsorbents synthesized by extrusion.

2.4.5 Casting. 
The casting method is to first mix active components, additives, and the solvent to obtain a casting solution. Then the casting solution is put into a mold and undergoes a series of physical/chemical transitions (typically aging) to consolidate, followed by drying, calcination and other post-treatments to become a robust structured adsorbent (Fig. 11).167,168 Common casting methods include sol-gel processing,169 solvent casting,170 and freeze casting.171,172 The structure of the adsorbent synthesized by casting is dependent on the mold shape, and in most cases, it is a cylindrical, cubic, annular monolith or film. Different types of components including silica-based,173 carbon-based,174 alumina,175 zeolite,176,177 and organic polymer materials178 are used, which can be further chemically modified (such as amine functionalization), and the resulting adsorbents typically exhibit adjustable gas separation performance.
 Fig. 11  A typical procedure of casting for structured adsorbent synthesis. 
The silica-based monoliths are typically prepared by sol-gel processing. The basic process of the sol-gel process involves the hydrolysis of suitable precursors (usually metal alkoxides) and their subsequent condensation, during which water or alcohol is released.179 The length increase of polymer chains leads to the formation of nanoparticles in the sol, and the binding between these chains results in the aggregation of nanoparticles.180 Therefore, the solution turns into a solid gel. An early study demonstrated the potential of the sol-gel method to synthesize silica monolith with adjustable pore structure.169 By controlling the phase separation and gelation kinetics during the sol-gel transition process, macropores in the monolithic bodies are formed. Also, mesoporosity can be regulated with supramolecular templates. Inspired by this work, Chen et al.181 later fabricated a silica monolith with a hierarchical pore structure and impregnated it with PEI. The cylindrical amine-modified monolith exhibited good CO2 capturing capacity (∼4.77 mmol g−1) and reversible sorption performance. Following a similar route, Long et al.182 utilized this type of PEI-impregnated silica monolith to capture H2S. As a result, the adsorbent demonstrated a larger H2S breakthrough capacity of 1.27 mmol g−1 at 22 °C than that of PEI-loaded SBA-15 or MCM-41.
For a simplified synthesis, Wen et al.183 designed a one-pot method to fabricate the amine-modified mesoporous silica monolith. In this work, TEPA was used as an additive during the hydrothermal synthetic system, and the hydrolysis and condensation of silicate precursors were controlled by adjusting the composition of the initial reaction mixture. The resulted monolith demonstrated efficient CO2 adsorption and adequate mechanical intensity. Similarly, Zhao et al.69 synthesized PEI-modified silica monolith through a sol-gel method using PEI as template agents. The effects of PEI molecular weights on the specific surface area and pore size distribution of adsorbents were investigated. By contrast, in the study of Sharma et al.,184 it was found that controlling ionic character/chain length of surfactants and polymers can adjust pore diameter and surface area of porous silica monoliths. From the viewpoint of economic efficiency and cleaner production, the use of chitosan as a biotemplate was also demonstrated to be effective for silica monolith synthesis.185 Kong et al.186 proposed a solvothermal-assisted sol-gel process combined with supercritical drying to prepare cylindrical amine-modified silica composite aerogel. The obtained adsorbent not only achieved high capacity in ultralow CO2 concentration, but also exhibited stable cyclic performance. To further characterize its CO2 capture performance, Gargiulo et al.187 modeled the CO2 isotherms of the polyethylene oxide-templated silica monoliths modified with PEI at different temperatures. The isosteric heat of adsorption, adsorbent affinity toward CO2, and heterogeneity level of the adsorption process were evaluated. Guo et al.188 prepared hierarchically porous silica (HPS) monoliths with well-defined macro-mesopores by sol-gel method and modified them with PEI. The results showed that the porous structure of HPS-PEI was preserved after modification, and the adsorbents exhibited the highest CO2 capacity of 2.44 mmol g−1 at 75 °C in the CO2 partial pressure of 100 kPa. Maresz et al.189 modified the hierarchically structured monoliths by amine impregnation and grafting, and studied the effect of the support structure and polyamine type on CO2 capture. It was found that due to the larger surface area of the monolith, the thickness of the active layer in highly amine-loaded sorbents was low and thus the adsorption site accessibility was improved. Zhou et al.26 immobilized MCM-41 nanoparticles into the 3-dimensional network gel formed by polymerization of organic polymer (Fig. 12). The resulted monolith can be produced through different molds, and they exhibited a high surface area (∼1088 m2 g−1) and mechanical strength. The monolith was impregnated with TEPA and achieved a capacity of 3.43 mmol g−1 at 75 °C under 1 atm pure CO2.

In addition to high porosity, carbon-based monoliths have unique properties such as hydrophobicity and conductivity, so they may perform better than silica-based materials in some cases. Hao et al.190 prepared a nitrogen-containing carbon monolith by direct pyrolysis of the copolymer of resorcinol, formaldehyde, and lysine, requiring a gelation time of only 5 min. The surface area and the nitrogen content of a carbon matrix can be changed by controlling the carbonization conditions. The optimized CO2 adsorption capacity of the monolith achieved 3.13 mmol g−1 at room temperature. They later45 developed a poly(benzoxazine-co-resol)-based carbon monolith with high mechanical strength and carbon capture performance. During the synthesis, diamines were used as the nitrogen source, and the benzoxazine-co-resol gel underwent a self-assembly and carbonization process to become a crack-free porous carbon monolith. The poly(benzoxazineco-resol) offers a high degree of molecular-design flexibility and this synthesis can be easily scaled up. Using a nanocasting technique, Singh et al.174 prepared the oxygen and sulfur-enriched carbon monoliths and investigated the effect of heteroatom doping on the material properties. Results show that the nanocasted monoliths exhibited much greater CO2 adsorption capacities than that of direct carbonized samples, which is ascribed to the fact that the incorporation of oxygen and sulfur functionalities increases the basic character of the monoliths. Kutorglo et al.191 used a sol-gel method to prepare hierarchically porous carbon-based monoliths. The approach is based on the incorporation of polystyrene nanoparticles and expanded graphite into a nitrogen-rich precursor, which is polymerized to form 3D monoliths. The obtained adsorbents have adjustable porosity and outstanding capture performance with CO2 capacities reaching 6.52 mmol g−1 at 273.15 K and 1 bar.
Many types of organic polymers have been proved to be promising materials for monolith preparation by casting. Song et al.192 used quaternized chitosan and poly(vinyl alcohol) to synthesize aerogel monoliths. The cross-linking with poly(vinyl alcohol) helps quaternized chitosan overcome the shortcoming of being water soluble, thus they can be applied for efficient CO2 moisture swing adsorption from air. Webley et al.25 manufactured solvent impregnated polymers (SIPs) by a simple, one-pot method. A concentrated solvent in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) emulsion is first created via shear emulsification, and it is then cast into a flat film. This method allows solvents with inconvenient fluid properties to be used for efficient gas separation. Combining the advantages of SIPs and nanoparticle organic hybrid materials (NOHMs), Park et al.193 incorporated liquid-like nanoparticle organic hybrid materials functionalized with polyethylenimine (NOHM-I-PEI) into gas-permeable polymers and obtained a film-shaped hybrid CO2 capture material. Results show that the NPEI-SIPs exhibited drastically increased kinetics and remarkable CO2 capacity compared with that of neat NOHM-I-PEI due to a large increase in interfacial surface area. Wang et al.178 prepared a porous polymer monolith by high inner phase emulsion (HIPE) polymerization of styrene and divinylbenzene and simultaneously functionalized it with high molecular weight PEI (Mw = 70000 Da). The pore structure of the one-step fabricated PEI@polyHIPE can be adjusted, and they showed a maximum adsorption CO2 capacity of 4.18 mmol g−1 at 20 °C under humid conditions. Valdebenito et al.170 used agricultural waste corn husks and oat hulls as raw materials to fabricate cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs). The CNFs were then used to prepare films by solvent casting and modified by amines for CO2 capture. The produced films were thermally stable, and exhibited a capacity of 0.90–1.27 mmol g−1 in 99.9% CO2 flow at 25 °C. Kong et al.194 also achieved the shaping of cellulose by casting. In their study, commercial cellulose powder was used to fabricate a cellulose aerogel through a phase inversion induced sol-gel process along with supercritical drying. The amine-modified cellulose aerogel achieved a CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.20 mmol g−1 with dry 1% CO2 and exhibited excellent stability within 20 adsorption–desorption cycles.

Table 7 summarizes the main features of structured adsorbent synthesized by casting. As can be seen, the casting method can directly shape different types of materials into monoliths with no/less use of the binder. They have various textural properties, and the adsorption performance can be fully optimized by adjusting the synthesis. While some manufacturing processes seem energy- and time-consuming, others are assumed to be scalable and cost-effective. However, most studies focus on the adsorption capability of the materials, and they are only shaped as small-scale simple structures. To apply this method to industrial applications, the feasibility of manufacturing larger-sized and more complex structured monoliths needs to be evaluated. If this issue can be addressed, the casting method could reasonably produce desirable materials with high adsorbent loading, good heat and mass transfer performance, and strong mechanical stability.

2.4.6 Spinning. 
The spinning method is to make the prepared solution solidify along a certain trajectory through the phase inversion process, and finally form structured adsorbents with the shape of the fiber. The adsorbent content can be controlled according to the synthesis methods. The fiber structure can particularly facilitate the temperature and pressure swing during cycles. The spinning method typically produces fiber adsorbents with excellent heat and mass transfer performance, and the fiber has high flexibility, which makes it conveniently arranged in the space. Up to date, dry-wet spinning and electrospinning are the main spinning techniques to produce fiber-shaped adsorbents.
2.4.6.1 Dry-wet spinning. 
The dry-wet spinning process is one of the solution spinning methods. The dry-wet spinning method can fabricate both hollow fibers and solid fibers. The hollow fiber is typically loaded in gas–solid contactors with advanced thermal management modules due to their two distinct flow paths inside the lumens and outside the impermeable sheath layers.18Fig. 13(a) depicts a representative schematic of the dry-wet spinning apparatus.195 The spinning solution contains the adsorbent, solvent, polymer, and other additives. The solution is pressed through a spinneret and subsequently immersed in a coagulation bath containing the non-solvent. During spinning, the exchange of solvent and non-solvent leads to thermodynamic instability of the spinning solution and induces phase separation into polymer-rich phase and polymer-poor phase. Then, the polymer-rich phase solidifies to form the bulk of the membrane that entraps the adsorbent inside, while the polymer-poor phase forms a pore structure. Fig. 13(b and c) show the structure schematic and photograph of hollow fiber sorbents, respectively.

In 2009, Koros and co-workers196 firstly incorporated powder adsorbents into porous hollow fibers prepared by the dry-wet spinning method and designed a rapid temperature swing adsorption (RTSA) system. The system takes advantage of the hollow fiber morphology by passing cooling water through the bores during sorption to maximize sorption capacities and steam through the bores during regeneration to desorb CO2 efficiently. During the spin dope preparation, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), cellulose acetate (CA), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), deionized water, and zeolite 13X were used as a pore former, binder, solvent, non-solvent, and adsorbent, respectively. Then, a latex form of polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) was used to create the lumen layer inside the fiber via a post-treatment. The resulted fiber sorbents exhibited lower CO2 capacity but faster response time compared to that of 13X crystals. Later, the kinetics performance and multicomponent competitive sorption of zeolite 13X fibers both in the absence and the presence of a heat transfer fluid were examined for the RSTA process.198,199 It was observed that the uncooled fiber sorption resulted in up to 40% losses in CO2 breakthrough capacities, while the cooled fiber sorption maintained capacities at all flue gas superficial velocities studied. In other studies,200,201 zeolite NaY was embedded in hollow fibers that were used to remove H2S from natural gas and CO2 from H2, respectively. For the H2 purification, an experimental apparatus for the rapid pressure swing adsorption was assembled, and one hundred cycles were performed on the cooled hollow fiber sorbent, resulting in a product purity of 99.2% and recovery of 88.1%. To simplify the synthesis, the simultaneous co-extrusion of a barrier polymer sheath dope along with the fiber sorbent core dope was developed.202 Unlike the previous samples, the dual-layer hollow fiber has a barrier sheath layer outside and the adsorbent dope inside. The effects of core, sheath spin dope and bore fluid compositions, air-gap height, and coagulation bath temperatures on the fiber properties were examined.
The amine-functionalization enables the fiber sorbent to capture CO2via chemisorption. However, the conventional impregnation and grafting methods were found to be ineffective for synthesized fibers, possibly due to the amine leaching during the spinning process. Innovatively, their study in 2013 achieved the successful amine-loading in hollow fiber by a post-spinning infusion method (Fig. 14).52 This technique infuses polyethyleneimine (PEI) into cellulose/mesoporous silica hollow fibers during the solvent exchange steps after non-solvent induced phase separation spinning. The resulted sorbents are demonstrated to have a nitrogen loading of 0.52 mmol g−1 and CO2 uptake of 0.92 mmol g−1 in 10% CO2 at 35 °C. The 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APS)-incorporated cellulose/mesoporous silica fibers were subsequently synthesized and compared with PEI-incorporated fibers.203 For these two types of fiber sorbents, the amines were assumed to be better dispersed over the pores after the spinning process, thus minimizing the CO2 diffusion resistance. Their dynamic adsorption behaviors for the RSTA system were evaluated in a later study.204 This work was expanded by infusing three weight PEIs into polyamide imide (PAI, Torlon) hollow fibers.205 The effect of water in the ring-opening reaction was also studied, and it was found that a proper amount of water in the reaction mixture enhanced the PEI functionalization degree to Torlon and resulted in higher CO2 uptake. After the successful attempt of using Torlon to spin fibers, silica was incorporated to increase the capacity because of its ability to sorb and stabilize PEI.206–208 To overcome the kinetic limitation during the CO2 adsorption of PEI/silica/Torlon fibers, glycerol was added into the post-infusion process.209 It was found that the PEI/silica/PAI-glycerol fiber sorbents had a double functional sorption capacity, and the optimal adsorption temperature was decreased from 65 °C to 35 °C. Compared with the mesoporous silica-based fibers, it was proven that a monodispersed mesoporous nanosilica/Torlon/APS hollow fiber composite had a higher CO2 capacity of 1.5 and 1.9 mmol g−1 at 35 and 60 °C, respectively, due to the improved pore structure of the amine support.210 For adsorption performance improvement, other materials with advanced pore structures such as MOFs71,195 and zirconia–titania–silica nanoparticles211,212 have also been used to prepare fiber sorbents. As the negative emission technology gains attention, experiments using hollow fiber sorbents for direct air capture were also carried out.195,213 A recent study by Zhang et al.214 developed tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) grafted polyacrylonitrile (PAN) hollow fibers for CO2 capture from low concentration sources. The sorbents showed CO2 adsorption capacities at low concentrations (470–5000 ppm) of 1.70 to 3.66 mmol g−1. Subsequently, the TEPA grafted polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) hollow fiber sorbent was synthesized.215 The carbon capture performance of the TEPA@PAN-PMMA fiber was evaluated in a 0.3% CO2/N2 gas mixture at ambient temperature. The CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.5 mmol g−1 under dry conditions and stable cyclic TSA performance were observed.

To further verify the practicability of hollow fiber sorbents for gas separation, studies in terms of the impurity tolerance, cyclic process simulation, operation energy consumption, and economic analysis were performed. For post-combustion carbon capture, the trace acid gas could deteriorate the sorbent performance, thus the stability of amine-based hollow fiber sorbents in the presence of NO and SO2 was examined.216 While the 200 ppm NO did not cause degradation of all types of amine-grafted fibers, it was found that secondary amines had stronger tolerance against SO2 than primary amines, and tertiary amines had good potential for flue gas desulfurization with high SO2/N adsorption ratio and excellent reversibility. The RTSA system performance optimization and cost estimation were performed in a series of simulation studies,198,217–219 and the following research performed experiments for model validation.220
The dry-wet spinning method offers high production flexibility. The spinning dope composition and the spinning parameters are both adjustable to allow various types of materials to be spun. The adsorbent loading in the final product fiber is typically within 50–75 wt% and chemical modifications can be performed, which brings in the high adsorption capacity of the fiber sorbents. In addition, the rapid production speed and low capital cost make it scalable for industrial applications.
2.4.6.2 Electrospinning. 
Electrospinning is a potential nanofiber preparation technique due to its simple equipment, low spinning cost, and good spinning compatibility. A typical electrospinning procedure is shown in Fig. 15.221 The principle is to apply a high voltage of 100 to 300 kV to the prepared polymer solution and make it polarized. With the increase of the electric field force, the polymer solution becomes a jet that continuously solidifies and finally falls on the receiving device to become polymer fibers. During electrospinning, the interior structure of the adsorbent could be tuned via changing spin process parameters, solution composition, and spinneret design. The electrospinning method typically produces solid fibers that are used directly in bundles or woven into fiber mats as adsorbents.
 Fig. 15  A fabrication schematic of electrospinning. 
Up to now, materials that have been made into fibers by electrospinning mainly include MOFs and organic polymers. Readers are referred to reviews that focus on fabrication strategies19 and applications of MOFs-incorporated fibers.222 Herein, representative studies in adsorptive gas separation are briefly introduced. An early study by Ostermann et al.223 for the first time presented the characterization of composite MOF-polymer nanofibers fabricated by electrospinning. During the synthesis, the ZIF-8 nanoparticles in methanol were prepared, together with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and they were spun to produce a non-woven mat that combined the advantages of both the MOF and the polymer, achieving a hierarchical nanostructure. Later, Ren et al.224 incorporated Zr-MOF and Cr-MOF into electrospun nanofibers that were evaluated as hydrogen storage media. With 20 wt% MOF loading, the fiber composites achieved 50% of the H2 uptake of individual MOF nanocrystals. Mu et al.225 presented a novel method for increasing effective nanoparticle loading in electrospun fibers. Various ratios of Matrimid 5218 and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) were blended, and ZIF-8 was suspended in the polymer, followed by being electrospun to form ZIF-8 impregnated fibers. After PEO removal, the high ZIF-8/nanofiber loadings were achieved and the N2 uptake was increased. Further, they investigated the influence of particle size and loading on particle accessibility of the fiber.226 The 200 nm and 12.5 μm ZIF-8 particles were spun and compared, and it was found they were both nearly completely wrapped by PEI at loadings ∼10 wt%. As the loading increased, the particle accessibility increased and became available for adsorption from the 25 wt% loading. The following study by the same team227 compared ion-exchange resin (IER) particles embedded in dense electrospun fibers and porous electrospun fibers in terms of their kinetic uptake of CO2. They found that the sorption halftime for both electrospun fibers was 10 ± 3 min, demonstrating that electrospinning was a promising technique to improve the sorption kinetics. To quantitively characterize the nanoparticle dispersion inside the electrospun fibers, they developed a simulation model assessing the effects of nanoparticle volume loading (ϕ) fiber-to-particle diameter ratios (D/d) on the dispersion based on the interparticle distance.228 This model proved to serve as a standard for comparison for experimental studies and dispersion models through its comparability with microscopy techniques.
More recently, Abbasi et al.229 developed a new nanofibrous amine containing adsorbent for CO2 removal at ambient conditions using electrospinning of syndiotactic polypropylene followed by radiation induced grafting of glycidyl methacrylate and subsequent functionalization with ethanolamine. A maximum adsorption capacity of 2.87 mmol g−1 was achieved accompanied by good mechanical characteristics and a high amine efficiency of 75% at room temperature. Choi et al.230 prepared a series of MOF immobilized polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fiber mats with different particle loadings via the electrospinning method. Results show that PAN/ZIF-8 and PAN/HKUST-1 mats with 60 wt% loading had a maximum CO2 capacity of 0.55 mmol g−1 and 2.55 mmol g−1 at 25 °C and 1 bar, respectively. They further impregnated PEI into these fibers, and found that CO2 adsorption capacity increased by 45% and selectivity increased from 6 to 54. Kretzschmar et al.231 electrospun a solution containing 10 wt% PAN in N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) and performed carbonization to obtain carbon nanofibers. They tailored the general properties by means of altering the carbonization parameters, and a superior CO2/N2 selectivity was achieved due to a molecular-sieve effect in very narrow slit pores. Using a similar method, Zainab et al.232 prepared electrospun carbon nanofibers with a multi-aperture/opening porous hierarchical structure (Fig. 16). The nanofibers not only offered a desirable CO2 capacity of 3.11 mmol g−1 but also retained stable during 50 cycles of CO2 adsorption/desorption.

The electrospun fibers have highly tunable physicochemical properties and have been extensively investigated in different applications. Electrospinning has the advantages of rapid production and easy scalability, but it is also limited by the complexity of the device to some extent. Future research may consider synthesizing diverse structures for gas separation under conditions of reduced fabrication complexity to further improve the process efficiency. The main features of structured adsorbents synthesized by spinning are summarized in Table 8.

2.4.7 3D printing. 
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a “bottom-up” method that achieves molding requirements by depositing materials layer by layer. It started in the late twentieth century and has recently been applied in adsorbent synthesis. It can convert digital files into physical models, thus breaking the constraints of traditional manufacturing methods. According to the molding principle, 3D printing is mainly divided into four forms: the direct ink writing (DIW), fused deposition modeling (FDM), digital light procession (DLP), and selective laser sintering (SLS).233 The fabrication processes of FDM, DLP, and SLS were relatively more complex, so they remained relatively less developed with regard to adsorbent synthesis, though they also show great promise due to the refined manufacturing capability. By contrast, the DIW method has been extensively investigated in adsorptive gas separation. It operates in a similar pattern as the extrusion method. The active components, binder, plasticizer, and solvent are first combined to form the printable paste (also known as “ink”) and loaded into a syringe. Then, the paste is deposited following a certain path determined by the pre-drawn electronic structure file. After undergoing post-treatments like vacuum drying and calcination, the deposit finally forms the structured adsorbent. Informative reviews8,9,233,234 focusing on the fabrications, geometries, and applications of 3D printed structured adsorbents have recently been reported. Readers are referred to these papers for thorough information about the materials' properties. Herein, the latest studies and authors' personal viewpoints on 3D printed adsorbents are summarized. The main features of structured adsorbents synthesized by 3D printing are summarized in Table 9.

As is pointed out, the rheological properties of ink greatly influence printing efficacy, which is verified in several studies mentioned below. Lee et al.235 3D printed a solution-processible, hypercrosslinkable, and functionalizable polymer via direct ink writing (Fig. 17(a)). The ink was prepared by adding brominated poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO) in the organic solvent dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CHL), or toluene (TOL). After printing with a pressure-controlled extrusion-based 3D printer, the 3D monolithic brominated PPO (PPO-Br) was hyper-crosslinked and amine-functionalized. It was shown that the printability of the PPO-Br inks was influenced by the solution viscosity, solution evaporation rate, and PPO-Br concentration. Due to the rapid evaporation, the DCM and CHL inks were extrudable through the 3D printing process with PPO-Br concentration up to 45 wt%, while the TOL-containing ink did not have favorable rheological behavior. By comparing the storage modulus and loss modulus, the rheological behavior of solidified inks was further revealed. Chen et al.236 printed zeolite 3A films on a polyimide (PI) circuit for indoor level (1 ppm) formaldehyde removal. Ethylenevinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer and bentonite clay were used as binders, and carboxymethyl cellulose was used as a plasticizer. Different amount of sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) as a surface-active agent was added to the inks and rheological properties were tested. It was observed that SDS improved the solid dispersion in the solution and resulted in less sedimentation. Moreover, a higher concentration of SDS increased and decreased the viscosity at a low and high shear rate respectively, which was favorable for smooth 3D printing and easy solidification.

The direct ink writing technique has recently been used to fabricate dual-functional materials (DFMs) that achieve carbon capture and conversion simultaneously. Rezaei et al.237 formulated structured DFMs by directly 3D printing metal-oxide-CaO/ZSM-5 inks into monolithic contactors for carbon capture and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In, Ce, Cr, and Mo metal dopants were compared and Cr–CaO/ZSM-5 was found to have the best performance with 56% CO2 conversion, 91.2% C2H4 selectivity, and 33.8% C2H4 yield due to the high acidity and numerous oxidation states of Cr2O3. The subsequent study238 compared another four metal dopants V, Ga, Ni, and Ti, and V–CaO/ZSM-5 exhibited an improved adsorption/catalysis effect. Later, the metal-doped CaO/ZSM-5 materials were used to perform integrated direct air capture and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.239 It was found that Ti-doped monolith generated the best balance of CO2 conversion (76%) and propylene selectivity (39%). This indicates that novel printing methods can generate potential DFMs for combined CO2 capture and utilization.
Other latest investigations address problems of different aspects using 3D printing. Zeolites and carbonaceous were mixed with binders to fabricate electrically conductive monoliths.240,241 They proved effective CO2 capture performance in electric swing adsorption cycles. Monoliths can be amine-functionalized to achieve effective chemisorption in carbon capture. It has been found that pre-functionalization and post-functionalization typically result in different textural properties and adsorption performance.8 By contrast, in the study by Krishnamurthy et al.,242 polyethyleneimine was added into the paste that contains multi-walled carbon nanotubes, anionic surfactant UBEDISP1d83-N2, and binder polyvinyl alcohol (Fig. 17(b and c)). The resulted monolith exhibited good performance with a capacity of 2.2 mol m−3 s−1. Though no comparison with pre- and post-functionalization monolith was conducted, this reveals the possible strategy to perform amine-functionalization during the paste preparation. Based on the well-developed 3D printed activated carbon monolith, Rezaei et al.29 assessed the CO2/CH4 separation performance in a pressure swing adsorption process. The influence of adsorption pressure, adsorbate superficial velocity, and adsorption time were evaluated. It was found that 3D printed monoliths not only reduce energy consumption, but also achieve comparable light species purity, recovery, and productivity, compared to commercial beaded adsorbents.
Recently, solution-based additive manufacturing (SBAM) was reported to fabricate structured adsorbents by depositing ternary polymeric inks. After evaporation, the relatively fewer volatile components in the inks undergo a rapid phase transition to form porous filaments.243 This solution-based printing technique, inspired by the solution spinning method, is theoretically compatible with any polymer and greatly expands the range of applications of 3D printing. Furthermore, the internal porosity of the monoliths fabricated by solution-based printing methods can be controlled for different scenarios. Compared with traditional DIW techniques, the solution-based printing can eliminate shrinkage caused by evaporation and create nanopores without using additives or nanoscale nozzles. Zhang et al.244 printed the polymer PIM-1, which is incompatible with traditional additive manufacturing techniques, into a highly efficient mass transfer contactor with hierarchical porosity, which was able to consistently and fully remove toluene from N2 for 1.7 hours. Later, they provided a practical guide to the development of ternary polymer inks.243 This paper discusses the common challenges of solution-based printing, and carried out a case study using the polymer Matrimid 5218. It was pointed out that a successful ternary ink formulation requires a balance of solution thermodynamics (phase separation), mass transfer (solvent evaporation), and rheology.
The superiority of the 3D printing technique is mainly due to the following reasons. First, as with the extrusion method, it fabricates adsorbents with high active component content because the inert substrate is not required. The binder and plasticizer are included, but they typically are reported to make up only 0–20 wt%. This imparts the structured adsorbent a high capacity per unit mass. Second, conceptually any powder materials can be shaped into structured adsorbents via 3D printing with an adjustment of the paste composition. The types and percentages of the binder, plasticizer, and solvent can all be varied to become compatible with the adsorbent. Thus, the physical and chemical properties of the adsorbent can be most retained and an optimized adsorption performance can be achieved. Third, the printing path is determined by the electronic model that can be flexibly customized, so it can conceptually synthesize adsorbents with any three-dimensional structures. Complex configurations are available and geometric variations can be conveniently achieved. Fourth, the production process is relatively simple, so it consumes less time and the cost may be further reduced.
However, the use of 3D printing in adsorbent synthesis is a newer issue. Although some studies have demonstrated its advantages, the development is not mature and the technical understating is not comprehensive. To extend its application, there are several barriers that need to be overcome. First, for different types of adsorbents, the paste preparation and printing strategy can be varied. This means that the performance optimization of new structured adsorbents can be case by case, which requires nontrivial labor and time. Second, the current 3D-printed adsorbents are limited in the laboratory scale. To produce scaled-up structured adsorbents, larger-sized printers and more pastes are needed. During the scale-up process, the rheological behavior of the paste and the consolidation behavior of the deposit may change. Therefore, trial experiments should be performed to acquire related engineering experience. Third, there are currently no feasible ways to automate the 3D printing process. For industrial applications, a large-sized structured adsorbent can be alternated by the combined stacking of a large number of small-sized samples. Because automated assembly line production has not yet been achieved, the production of a large number of small-sized structured adsorbents still results in high capital costs. To this end, an intelligent manufacturing stream should be developed.
It is very likely for 3D printing to become a future technique that shapes adsorbents flexibly and rapidly. It has superior advantages over other shaping methods in terms of production cost and molding capability. However, the research about its versatility, automation, and scale-up should be further explored to promote its wider applications.


2.4.8 Other shaping techniques. 
In addition to the above-mentioned main types of shaping techniques, some new synthetic methods of structured adsorbents have been reported in recent years, although their applications still remain relatively limited.
Pulsed current processing (PCP), also known as spark plasma sintering, is also used to fabricate monoliths. This method simultaneously applies pulsed current and compressive force to the powder material. The pulsed current generates Joule heat, which rapidly heats the powder, causing it to solidify under the effects of both sintering and compression. This method can actually be considered a variation of the extrusion technique, often enabling the powder material to be tightly bound without the use of binders. Structured adsorbents in the forms of zeolite cylinders, aluminum phosphate cylinders, and zeolite laminates by pulsed current treatment were investigated, and their efficient carbon capture ability was verified.23,245,246
In addition to dry-wet spinning, hollow fibers can also be fabricated by microfiltration. The carbon nanotubes (CNT) solution was first prepared and then filtered in a hollow fiber microfiltration membrane by applying pressure at one end.247 The CNTs shrink after washing and drying, and they are removed to become hollow fiber structured adsorbents. This process can also be modified as needed. Keller et al.248 impregnated CNTs with PEI to obtain hollow fibers that can capture CO2. Later, silica particles were mixed into the CNT solution to further enhance its specific surface area and CO2 adsorption capacity.73 The hollow fiber prepared by the micro-nanofiltration method has good thermal and chemical stability.
The polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1) is an organic polymer that can be dissolved in common organic solvents.249 It has high porosity and good permeability and can accommodate active molecules (i.e., amines) that play a role in adsorption. Therefore, after modification, it can be applied to the gas separation process. Generally, the PIM-1 powder is dissolved in the organic solvent and the PIM-1 solution consolidates into a specific shape, or is coated onto the surface of the substrate and becomes adsorbent films. The study by Pang et al.250 shows that the PEI-loaded PIM-1 has good CO2 adsorption performance, and these adsorption capacities are not directly related to the adsorbent topology, which verifies the feasibility of using it to make various CO2 structured adsorbents (Fig. 18(a)). Wang et al.251 adjusted the morphology and porosity of PIM nanofibers by controlling the solvent/non-solvent/polymer interactions (Fig. 18(b)). The PIM-1 fibers obtained from tetrahydrofuran and different cosolvents revealed the unique changes in cross-sectional shape from a corrugated circle to belt dumbbell. Recently, in order to enhance the microstructure stability of PIM-1, Zhang et al.252 adopted a post-manufacturing polymer stabilization method, i.e. vapor phase infiltration (VPI), to synthesize PEI/AlOx/PIM-1 fiber, which could accommodate higher content of PEI. The CO2 capacity of PEI/PIM-1 composite was improved without sacrificing its processing performance (Fig. 18(c)).

2.4.9 Role of binder in the shaping process. 
To enhance the mechanical strength of structured adsorbents, binders have been widely used in the shaping process. When using the coating method to fabricate the structured adsorbent, it may be possible to increase the loading of the active coating film by increasing the proportion of the binder. However, since the binder is generally not adsorptive-active, it tends to reduce the adsorption capacity while increasing the rigidity of the structure. Therefore, the role of the binder is two-sided. In general, as the proportion of binder increases, the binding effect will be stronger but correspondingly, the degree of reduction in adsorption capacity will be greater. In the process of pelletization, granulation, extrusion, coating, and 3D printing, more or fewer binders are required. On the premise of ensuring the bond strength, the amount of binder used should generally be as small as possible to maximize the performance of the structural adsorbent. However, there are also some special cases.
For instance, the binder itself not only acts as an adhesive but also as a support for the active components. In the study of Wu et al.,44 the silica sol can not only bond to the surface of the ceramic honeycomb, but also act as porous support accommodating polyethyleneimines. In this case, it is desirable to load amine-modified silica sol on the ceramic fiber as much as possible to improve the CO2 adsorption capacity per unit mass of the monolith. In another case, SBS is used as a binder to coat MOFs on substrates.48 Due to the hydrophobicity of SBS, when its proportion is increased, the water stability of the coating is enhanced, enabling the MOF coating to be used for a longer time under high humidity conditions. Therefore, the weight percentage of SBS should also be properly controlled to optimize the overall properties of the monolith. Monoliths without binders or with binders that can be removed by post-treatment have also been reported.253–255 Maximizing the content of active species should be one of the goals of adsorbent shaping. Therefore, future efforts should be made to reduce the proportion of the binder to a minimum or even zero. At the same time, it is better to make the incorporated binder have an additional beneficial effect, so that while reducing the adsorption capacity, it brings about the enhancement of other aspects.

3. Integrating structured adsorbents into gas–solid contactors
In industrial applications, after the adsorbent is shaped into a certain configuration, it is loaded into the gas–solid contactor for gas separation. A suitable loading pattern is significant, because it determines whether the adsorbent performance can be fully realized in the device, thus affecting the separation efficiency and energy consumption.256 From a practical point of view, this section introduces the routes to integrate the structured adsorbent into the corresponding gas–solid contactor, and analyzes the cyclic process design and system operation strategies to fill the gap between lab-scale experiments and scale-up employments.
3.1 Gas–solid contactor configurations for different types of structured adsorbents
Currently, there are mainly three types of gas–solid contactors in gas separation, namely the fixed bed, fluidized bed, and the moving bed.256 According to the shape of the structured adsorbent, it should be loaded into a suitable type of contactor in an optimized way. As is well understood, granules and pellets can be readily packed into the common fixed bed columns. This has been widely adopted because it is simple and compatible with almost any type of material. However, as stated before, this arrangement exhibits significant heat and mass transfer resistance and pressure drop, which deteriorates overall efficiency. An improved route is to pack the monoliths like honeycombs, laminates, and foams into the fixed bed to increase the bed voidage (Fig. 19(a)).148 This demonstrated apparent improvement in the dynamic adsorption performance in a couple of studies, and numerical models have been developed to quantitively characterize the difference between the packed monolith and pellets.35,61,162,257
 Fig. 19  The novel gas–solid contactor with fixed configuration: (a) the pellets, monoliths, and foam loaded in the fixed bed;261 (b) a lump-spired heat exchanger for humidity management;258 (c) the CO2 collector designed by Climeworks;260 (d) the fiber contactor with integrated heat management module.199 Reprinted with permission.

The fixed beds with novel configurations have been demonstrated to be advantageous for gas separation, where the adsorbents were loaded into the gas–solid contactors in different ways. In one example, Bigham et al.258 introduced a 3D printed lung bronchi-like heat exchanger for dehumidification (Fig. 19(b)). The heat exchanger had two intertwined bicontinuous flow networks that enabled highly efficient heat and mass transfer characteristics, and the desiccant zeolite 4A was coated on its surface. In operation, the air flowed in one network while the water flowed in another to facilitate the temperature swing. Climeworks259,260 designed a CO2 collector with a porous sheet installed in the sealed container (Fig. 19(c)). The amine-functionalized nanofibrillated cellulose was fabricated in the form of a thin sheet, thus they bring in desirable CO2 capture performance as well as favorable heat and mass transfer properties. Similar to the dehumidifier heat exchanger, a unique contactor with two distinct flow paths was adopted for hollow fiber adsorbents (Fig. 19(d)). Because of the dense barrier layer outside the hollow fiber, it is possible to pass water through the bores during sorption and hot steam during regeneration to realize rapid thermal cycles. Meanwhile, the high bed voidage derived from the parallel arrangement of fibers significantly reduced gas flow pressure drop.
The fluidized bed is designed for the particle adsorbent, so it is not concerned with the integration issue of structured adsorbents. In contrast, there are flexible designs for moving bed systems when they are combined with different structured adsorbents. On typical instance is the rotary wheel configuration. This design is firstly applied for air dehumidification, where the rotary wheel is divided into several areas (usually two to four) by partitions.17,262 The desiccant is typically coated on the wheel. The atmospheric air and regeneration air are passed through the adsorption area and regeneration area to induce adsorption and regeneration, respectively. The motor dives the wheel to keep rotating to allow continuous operation. Later studies have migrated this concept to VOCs adsorption and carbon capture. The VOCs adsorption rotary wheel is more similar to the dehumidification wheel because the gas flow rate is comparable and the type of adsorbent used is similar in these two cases.263,264
An example of carbon capture rotary wheels is the VeloxoTherm designed by Svante.265,266 The structured adsorbents in VeloxoTherm are based on a parallel plate contactor. Adsorbents are attached to the upper and lower layers of each plate, and a gas-impermeable and highly thermally conductive barrier layer is in the middle. Each plate is arranged in parallel with the prescribed wall thickness and spacing. Finally, they are assembled to become a rotary wheel. The main body of the wheel is divided into three areas, the adsorption area, regeneration area, and cooling area to achieve rapid and continuous post-combustion carbon capture. Typically, when the wheel-shaped adsorbent is installed into the device, treatments including wheel surface hardening, hemming, and dynamic sealing are performed to minimize the gas leakage problem during rotation.
Another configuration of the moving bed is the roller device. An example is provided by Wang et al.267 who fabricated a continuous atmospheric water generator based on their laboratory-developed HCS-LiCl nano sorbent. The core of the generator is a rotational cylinder mounted in the center (Fig. 20(c)). The HCS-LiCl nano sorbent was loaded onto the fibrous silica paper by a coating method, then the silica paper was wrapped around the rotational cylinder with a mass loading of 0.03 g cm−2. During the operation, the stepper motor rotates the cylinder to make the adsorbent alternately adsorb water from the air and the adsorbent is regenerated by sunlight heating. In another case, Tan et al.268 developed a dehumidifier with a roller-shape desiccant rotor (Fig. 20(d)). The supporting parts and outer covers of the rotor were manufactured by 3D printing, and the desiccant was coated on the commercial air filter. They are then assembled to form the advanced dehumidifier that captures water continuously. By far the roller-type adsorbents have all been fabricated by the coating method. To increase the adsorbent loading, other shaping techniques can be used. For instance, electrospinning can be utilized to fabricate fibrous adsorbent mats and wrap them around the cylinder, and 3D printing can be used to fabricate the roller-shaped adsorbent monolith. These potential strategies are likely to provide enhance adsorption performance.

3.2 Cyclic process design and operation strategies
The cyclic process design and operation strategies are practical issues that need to be optimized to facilitate the effective application of gas separation devices. At this level, the process performance indicators should be estimated to evaluate the device's overall efficacy. These mainly include the recovery, product purity, and operation energy consumption (with regard to dehumidification, the indicators also includes the dehumidification coefficient of performance, DCOP).269 Determination of cyclic process design and operating strategies can help engineers to estimate the plant footprint and perform techno-economic analysis.
The cyclic process design is mainly to determine the regeneration mode. The common regeneration modes include temperature swing adsorption, electric swing adsorption, pressure/vacuum swing adsorption, and moisture swing adsorption.270 Temperature swing adsorption (TSA) is widely adopted in most applications of structured contactors. In the case of hollow fiber sorbents, cool and hot water pass through the bore of fibers during adsorption and regeneration, respectively.199 The efficient heat transfer between the fluid and the fiber wall enables rapid temperature swing and near isothermal conditions. In the case of rotary wheels, cool and hot gas pass through the adsorption and regeneration zone, respectively.263,271 The porous honeycomb promotes heat and mass transfer, so a rapid thermal swing and lower regeneration temperature are possible.
The electric swing adsorption (ESA) process involves two working principles. One in fact acts like a TSA process with the only difference of the source for heating the column. Namely, in ESA the Joule effect of passing through the column is induced, while in TSA the hot gas or liquid is utilized.62,63,272 For instance, Lee et al.272 fabricated carbon monolith as an adsorbent with directing heating resistance. They loaded the monolith into a fixed bed and revealed an energy requirement of 57.8 kJ (m3 air)−1 for indoor CO2 removal. For the other principle, electrons are introduced and released to initiate redox reactions to capture the gas.273,274 One example is the study by Hatton et al.,274 where the gas–solid contactor is comprised of two cathode electrode substrates coated with a CO2-binding quinone–carbon nanotube composite sandwiching an anode electrode substrate coated with a ferrocene–CNT composite. Their device has a compact configuration and the cyclic process has reduced energy losses.
In the moisture swing adsorption (MSA) process, the adsorbents are usually quaternary amine-modified materials, which adsorb CO2 at low relative humidity and release CO2 at high relative humidity, thus eliminating a large amount of heating energy consumption.275 Hou et al.276 prepared film-shaped moisture swing sorbents by embedding quaternized crosslinked resins into poly(ethersulfone) (PES) matrixes with the tape-casting method. It is shown that the resin-PEI composites a possessed lower density than the pure resin samples and exhibited superior sorption kinetics.
When the honeycomb monolith is applied in the pressure swing adsorption (PSA), it has been demonstrated that a shorter cycle time can be used.29 Meanwhile, a high CO2 recovery rate and product purity can be achieved. The regeneration modes can also be used in combination. For the Climeworks' device shown in Fig. 19(c), a temperature vacuum swing adsorption (TVSA) is employed.260 For the adsorption step, the pressurized air was streamed through the reactor. While for the desorption step, the reactor inlet was sealed and evacuated to the desired desorption pressure via a vacuum pump. At the same time, the adsorbent was heated to the desired temperature to facilitate the CO2 desorption.
The cyclic process should be selected according to the adsorbent properties and the device configuration. Based on this, the operation strategies that include the arrangement of contactors, the flow of mass and energy, and frequency of mode switching can be determined. For specific gas separation goals, different gas flow path arrangements such as return gas and multiple-stage wheels are deployed.271,277 In addition, to enhance the system economy and environmental benefits, renewable energy and industrial waste heat are used to regenerate the adsorbent.278 For this, energy cascade management and thermal integration need to be considered.217 Unlike contactors with continuous operation characteristics such as rotary wheels and rollers, fixed-bed-based units require careful consideration of process switching between multiple columns. For example, the pilot scale system of Climeworks260 is composed of 12 CO2 collectors, several heat exchanges, a vacuum system, and a water separation unit. The collectors alternatively capture CO2 to achieve continuous operation. Jeong et al.279 proposed modular monolith adsorbent (MMA) design and studied the multi-bed operation of the temperature swing adsorption cycle to respond to variations in flue gas flow. Through simulations, they pointed out that the MMA systems had improved optimal solutions because of their design flexibility compared to the conventional passive design approach. The optimization of the operation strategy is helpful to improve the economy and reduce energy consumption, but it may also be unfavorable to adopt highly complicated strategies because this requires more advanced control systems.
4. Conclusions and outlook
For structured adsorbents, substantial progress has been made over the past few years regarding the customization of geometrically complex scaffolds with tunable physiochemical properties. Such progress is undeniable, however, there are remaining barriers that must be addressed prior to the scale-up implementation of various shaping techniques for structured adsorbent production. An ideal shaping technique should be compatible with any type of materials and can manufacture adsorbents in any shape. 3D printing is the closest to meeting this requirement, but there are still non-trivial bottlenecks in this technique, so other methods also need to be explored and utilized. To further improve the gas separation efficiency with shaping techniques, the main industrial needs and the possible roadmap to achieve them are summarized as follows.
First, the industrial gas separation requires fast, compatible with most adsorbent materials, and flexible shaping techniques. Though many molding methods have been developed, no method is readily available for any type of adsorbent. Some shaping techniques are only suitable for a set of materials, e.g., the growth method can only produce zeolite and MOF materials at present. Coating and 3D printing have the highest compatibility, but even such technologies require exploration of adaptation processes when obtaining new materials, which can be time-consuming. Some technologies can only fabricate structured adsorbents of simple shapes, which cannot meet the needs of flexible applications in the industry. Therefore, in the future, the shaping mechanism of these technologies should be further investigated to optimize the synthesis, and even develop a set of programs to automatically realize the highly efficient material-specific adjustments.
Second, the industrial gas separation requires larger-scaled structured adsorbents. Most of the shaping techniques are limited to the laboratory level. Currently, most of the structured adsorbents used in larger-scale installations currently are made by coating methods. The scale-up research is significant because there is a high probability that the shaping effect will not change linearly when scaling up the adsorbent to an industrial scale. In addition, there are relatively few studies on the effect of material shape and size on adsorption performance. Actually, many studies have shown that some ultra-complex structures have obvious beneficial effects on mass and heat transfer efficiency.258,280,281 Therefore, the influence of complex shapes can be further studied through the 3D printing technique, and more scale-up experiments should be carried out. Besides, more simulations of gas flow distribution are also needed to guide the scaled-up adsorptive gas separation process design.
Third, the industrial gas separation requires reliable lifetime assessments of structured adsorbents, as well as evaluations of the economics of shaping techniques. Although the adsorption capacity of structured adsorbents has been extensively studied, experiments on their durability, including mechanical strength, hydrothermal stability, and cycling stability, remain less reported. Long term stability tests should be carried out to evaluate the lifetime of the adsorbent, which is relevant to the assessment of the gas separation cost. Moreover, there are currently seldom studies on the economic evaluation of shaping techniques, which may be significant because the introduction of shaping techniques usually brings additional costs. In the following studies, the cost of various shaping techniques needs to be estimated to better select the appropriate scheme.
Last but not least, the industrial gas separation requires a more scientific matching strategy between structured adsorbents and gas–solid contactors. The topic of how the structured sorbent is integrated into the gas–solid contactor remains rarely explored, although the loading of the structured sorbent into the contactor plays an indispensable role in improving the gas separation efficiency. This issue can be further discussed from two aspects, that is, the gas–solid contactor can be designed according to the shape of the adsorbent, or the adsorbent can be shaped according to the requirements of the gas–solid contactor. Meanwhile, the appropriate regeneration mode and operation strategy should be coordinated to each other to exert the best gas separation performance in industrial applications.
