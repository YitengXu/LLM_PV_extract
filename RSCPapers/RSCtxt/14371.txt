    , Accepted 7th December 2016First published on 8th December 2016AbstractPhotodetectors have gained increasing interest in both academic and industrial domains in a ranging number of applications, including image sensing, communications, environmental monitoring and chemical/biological detection. Noble metal nanoparticles exhibit surface plasmons (SPs) associated with the enhancement of a local electromagnetic field surrounding the metal surface, leading to enhanced light absorption. Herein, size-controlled silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and gold nanorods (AuNRs) have been introduced into polymer photodiodes. The evaluated devices exhibit remarkable photocurrent enhancement at corresponding plasmon resonant wavelengths, directly resulting in a photosensitivity increase. When compared with a pristine photodiode, AgNPs-, AuNPs- and AuNRs-mediated devices reveal maximum enhancements of 46, 49 and 65% for responsivity and 39, 30 and 54% for detectivity for blue (450 nm), green (525 nm) and red (620 nm) light detection, respectively. The linear dynamic range of plasmon-mediated devices and their photoresponse stability have been further explored. The mechanism of plasmon-enhanced photocurrent has been analyzed using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements. The results indicate that plasmonic structures incorporated into polymer photodetectors can significantly improve the photoresponse in their plasmon resonant regions. This contribution is believed to showcase the effectiveness and attainable wavelength-selectable photodetection by tailoring the size and shape of coupled plasmonic nanostructures.
Introduction
Photoelectrical conversion on photodetectors has received increasing interest in a number of applications.1 Recent exploratory work has considered a wide range of semiconductor materials, e.g., Si, ZnO, GaN, carbon nanotubes, graphene, quantum dots, perovskites and conjugated polymers.2–9 Depending on their spectral response, photodetectors can be predominantly used in panchromatic or selective photodetection.10 Thus, both broadband- and narrowband-absorbing semiconductors are employed for photodetectors. Taking hybrid perovskite materials for example, broadband photodetectors showing high detectivity from ultraviolet (UV) to visible (Vis) or highly narrowband photodetectors with the spectral full-width at a half-maximum of <100 nm have been widely investigated in recent years.8,11–17 Usually, wide-bandgap semiconductors as photoactive materials can provide narrowband absorption but are only used in short-wavelength UV photodetectors.4 There is still the challenge to realize narrowband Vis or near infrared (NIR) detection.18,19 Although an increase of the active layer thickness could manipulate light absorption to result in narrowband external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of photodetectors, poorer charge transport properties also caused a loss in responsivity and detectivity.17,20 Actually, broadband photodetectors combined with optical filters are often applied when narrowband spectral responses are required for color discrimination,21 so developing excellent-performance photodetectors with high responsivity and detectivity from the UV to Vis to NIR region is particularly important for both panchromatic and selective photodetection applications.5,6 On the basis of broadband photodetectors, further selectively enhancing the photoresponse in a specific region would be more favorable for wavelength-selective photodetection application.

Via surface plasmon resonance (SPR), noble metal nanoparticles exhibit characteristic bands of optical attenuation, leading to an electromagnetic enhancement localized within a few tens of nm-distance of the nanomaterial’s surface (near-field enhancement, NFE).22 SPR simultaneously generates hot electrons via plasmon decay, which may transfer across the Schottky barrier at the metal–semiconductor interface and be detected as a photocurrent (direct electron transfer, DET).23,24 Both phenomena are believed to be able to enhance the photocurrent of plasmon-mediated photodetectors.25–29 Plasmon-enhanced absorption is however limited in its operational spectral range and by non-suppressed absorption in other non-plasmonic wavelength spectral ranges. It is indicated that a wavelength-selective enhanced photoresponse via the plasmonic effect can be feasible without sacrificing the overall performance of devices, which is different from the traditional strategy of suppressing the dark current to improve the detectivity in photodiodes by introducing hole and electron blocking layers that usually sacrifice the responsivity.5,6 In this work, commercially available poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) have been chosen as the photoactive materials, because polymer-based photodetectors possess unique features including room-temperature operation, high sensitivity, low working voltage, low cost, large-area detection and flexibility.30–32 Notwithstanding that the plasmonic effect of different nanostructured noble metals with varying morphology has been widely applied in organic solar cells to enhance their efficiencies,33–36 however, their incorporation into polymer photodetectors for the photodetection performance remains relatively unexplored in the open literature besides a few gold nanoparticle-based systems.37,38
The application of a plasmonic effect to selectively enhance the photoresponse of a filterless polymer photodiode is herein reported. We have investigated the impact of different noble metal nanostructures on the performance of plasmon-mediated photodiodes including the key figure-of-merit parameters of responsivity, detectivity, linear dynamic range and photoresponse stability. Size-controlled silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) or gold nanorods (AuNRs) were hence decorated onto ITO substrates to controllably locate their corresponding SPR bands in blue (380–470 nm), green (480–570 nm) and red (580–670 nm) light spectral ranges, respectively. The approach not only unveiled increasing photosensitivity of all nanoparticle-mediated photodiodes compared to that of a pristine device, but also showcased promising potential for filterless wavelength-selectable photodetection.
Results and discussion
Morphology and absorbance
Ag and Au nanoparticles, and Au nanorods were introduced onto ITO substrates by an electrostatic adhesion process described in the Experimental section. The structure of these plasmon-mediated photodetectors using commercial P3HT and PCBM as the active layer is succinctly summarized in Fig. 1a. A representative energy level diagram of the device is additionally depicted in Fig. 1b. The amount of plasmonic nanostructures introduced onto ITO substrates with a pretreated surface could be tuned by controlling the dipping time of the substrate in the prepared nanosuspension. Representative AFM images of AgNPs (∼15 nm), AuNPs (∼20 nm) and AuNRs (∼40/80 nm) adhered on the substrates are displayed in Fig. 1c. Measurements of the photocurrent of plasmonic AgNPs, AuNPs and AuNRs photodiodes revealed optimal responses under blue, green and red light illumination, when the dipping times in each corresponding nanosuspension were 30, 30 and 60 min, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†). Absorbance data were then collected and evaluated according to the varying dipping time of each sample (Fig. S2, ESI†). Results corroborated the assumption that attained wavelength-selective enhanced absorption ranges notably depend on the applied plasmonic nanoparticles in the photodetectors. The collected data unveiled a clear tendency to a red-region shift and broader spectral responses with increasing dipping times, leading in each case to specific and narrow SPR bands and poorer device performance. The selected samples exhibited strong SPR bands of AgNPs, AuNPs and AuNRs located in blue (380–470 nm), green (480–570 nm) and red (580–670 nm) spectral ranges, respectively (Fig. 1d).

More details of the morphology and absorbance evolution with different dipping times are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). 
Solution-processed ∼25 nm-thick ZnO films fabricated by sol–gel method were assumed to completely cover the surface of the prepared plasmonic nanostructures, according to previous literature reports.39 The consistency of the ZnO film color confirmed the stability of all plasmonic nanostructures following the annealing process carried out at 200 °C (Fig. S3a, ESI†). A similar morphology for all plasmonic nanostructures was further confirmed by AFM data following the deposition of a ∼270 nm-thick P3HT:PCBM active layer by spin-casting (Fig. S3b, ESI†). Root-mean-squared (RMS) roughness values of 5.16, 5.56, 6.80 and 7.04 nm were obtained for the pristine sample, AgNPs, AuNPs and AuNRs, respectively. Following the deposition of the P3HT:PCBM films an overall absorbance increase was further noticed compared to the pristine sample (Fig. S3c, ESI†). The cross-sectional analysis of the active layer is detailed in Fig. S3d (ESI†).
Although the surface roughness after the decoration with nanoparticles and nanorods is quite different (Fig. 1c), a ZnO layer coating on these nanostructures can improve the uniformity of the surface and make it smoother from cross-sectional AFM morphologies and phase images (Fig. S4–S7, ESI†). So the morphologies of the P3HT:PCBM active layer coated on the ZnO layer including different plasmonic nanostructures are similar to the pristine film. Furthermore, from their phase images shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), a similar ordered alignment of polymer aggregates was observed in all active layers, indicating that P3HT and PCBM were phase separated, which is important for the device performance. This is attributed to the slow drying process, described in the Experimental section.40 It is worth noting that the P3HT:PCBM films with analogous morphology and phase separation degree are beneficial for explicating the photodetector performance enhancement deriving from the SPR effect in the following study.
Characterization of photodiodes
Firstly, incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of all the photodiodes were measured, which revealed that plasmon-mediated devices showed an overall increase compared with the pristine sample (Fig. 2a). Spectral IPCE enhancement values (ΔIPCE (%, λ)) were calculated from the spectra of the pristine (IPCEpristine (%, λ)) and each plasmon-mediated device (IPCEplasmonic (%, λ)) (Fig. 2b) using the equation, ΔIPCE = (IPCEplasmonic − IPCEpristine)/IPCEpristine. It can be seen that maximum IPCE enhancement values of 37.6, 34.3 and 41.5% were obtained at 420, 535 and 620 nm wavelengths, respectively, with AgNPs-, AuNPs- and AuNRs-mediated devices. A good agreement was again found between the IPCE results and the absorbance of arrays of AgNPs, AuNPs and AuNRs (Fig. 1d).
 Fig. 2  (a) Measured IPCE spectra of the devices without (pristine as reference)/with AgNPs, AuNPs and AuNRs, respectively; (b) the corresponding IPCE enhancement of plasmon-mediated devices compared with the pristine sample. All devices were measured under 0 V bias. 
The IPCE enhancement is considered to mainly result from the interplay of several factors: first, the surface plasmon can strongly influence the dynamic properties of excitons and charge carriers through electric field enhancement, which facilitates the exciton dissociation, charge separation and extraction processes.41,42 Second, hot excitons or hot charge transfer states generated by the excess photon energy above the bandgap have been observed in various nanostructured semiconductors,43–45 which may also contribute to the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency. In addition, the energy absorbed by the plasmonic nanoparticles and consumed by the electron resonance may thermally dissipate into the surrounding environment and increase the local temperature,46–48 which could also modify the exciton and charge dynamics.
Responsivity (R), the ratio of photocurrent to incident light intensity, indicates how efficiently the detector responds to an optical signal. It is expressed as, (1)where Jph is the photocurrent and Llight is the incident light intensity. Specific detectivity (D*) conventionally reflects the performance of photodiodes, characterizing the sensitivity of a photodetector by taking into account the contributions of the photocurrent and dark current.5 Under the assumption that the current noise is due primarily to shot noise, D* can then be expressed as (2)with q, the absolute value of electron charge (1.6 × 10−19 Coulombs) and Jd, the dark current. A light-emitting diode alternatively providing monochromatic blue (450 nm), green (525 nm) and red (620 nm) light with tunable intensity was used. Fig. 3a displays current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for pristine, AgNPs-, AuNPs- and AuNRs-mediated devices measured under blue, green and red light illumination, respectively. The compared J–V curves including the data collection in dark condition are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The values of photocurrent and dark current of the above photodiodes at a bias of −0.5 V are illustrated in Fig. 3b.

Photocurrent and dark current values were taken at a voltage of −0.5 V, and light intensity was 15 mW cm−2. 
Photocurrent, dark current and estimated detectivity of pristine and plasmon-mediated photodiodes are summarized in Table 1. Noticeably low dark current density values in the 10−4 mA cm−2 range were attained with all photodiodes. With a low HOMO level (∼7.6 eV), ZnO serves as a unique hole-blocking layer at a reversed voltage to suppress dark current. This reversed dark current suppression found with all devices paved the ideal groundwork to focus the investigation of the plasmonic effect solely on photocurrent enhancement. A minor increase in the dark current levels witnessed in the presence of plasmonic nanoparticles was tentatively attributed to a film quality reduction corroborated by the RMS roughness data.

All plasmonic noble metal based photodiodes revealed a remarkable photocurrent density increase compared with the pristine device (Table 1). The higher photocurrent was believed to follow both the contribution of hot electrons surrounding the metal surface and the local electromagnetic field producing the enhanced absorption of light.49–51 Estimated improvement (%) was determined in each case based on the performance of the pristine device (Table 1). Expectedly analogous trends were achieved for the corresponding responsivity and detectivity enhancement values. High detectivity values in the 1012 Jones range were believed to be the result of plasmon-enhanced photocurrent, besides particularly low dark current levels. Fig. 3c and d provides a comparison of the responsivity and detectivity of all pristine and plasmon-mediated photodiodes. Our AgNPs-, AuNPs- and AuNRs-mediated devices revealed maximal responsivity and detectivity enhancements under blue, green and red light illumination, respectively. For each case, responsivity directly proportional to the photocurrent reached a maximum of 211, 267 and 253 mA W−1, respectively, which is even comparable to that of a commercial silicon photodetector and distinctly higher than other P3HT-based photodiodes.52–54 The calculated detectivity could be remarkably enhanced up to 39, 30 and 54%, respectively. The highest detectivity increase was hence observed in the AuNRs-mediated device under red light illumination. Since the SPR band of plasmonic nanoparticles is highly dependent on the diameter and aspect ratio of the nanostructures, AgNPs (∼70 nm), AuNPs (∼55 nm) and AuNRs (∼30/90 nm) have been also applied into photodiodes for comparison. The distributed morphologies and absorption spectra of the above nanostructures are shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The photocurrent of the photodiodes combined with larger nanoparticles or high aspect ratio nanorods was decreased and the dark current was increased slightly (Fig. S11, ESI†). This may be ascribed to the degradation of the film quality of the ZnO layer coating on the large nanoparticles and the mismatch between the SPR band of nanorods and the wavelength of detected light. Thus, the calculated responsivity was only 167, 214 and 162 mA W−1 for blue, green and red light detection, respectively, and the corresponding detectivity was all below 1012 Jones, indicating that the performance became worse compared to that of optimized devices with ∼15 nm AgNPs, ∼20 nm AuNPs and ∼40/80 nm AuNRs (Fig. S12, ESI†).
AgNPs-, AuNPs- and AuNRs-mediated photodiodes all showed distinctly wavelength-selective enhanced photodetection under blue, green and red regions, respectively. Results notably agree with the obtained IPCE enhancement trends of plasmon-mediated devices, as the plasmonic effect is believed to selectively generate a higher photocurrent in the corresponding spectral range (Fig. 2).25–29 With the wavelength-selective enhanced photoresponse applied in the photodetectors, it is possible to realize wavelength-selectable photodetection by tailoring the size and shape of different plasmonic noble metals without sacrificing the overall performance of the devices.
To attest the linearity of the devices, intensity-dependent photocurrent (IPC) measurements were performed as a function of incident light intensities under blue, green or red light illumination (Fig. 4). All devices exhibit a linear response along with intensity values up to 20 mW cm−2. With a continuous charge increment taking place inside the active layer, the observed deviation from linearity is however postulated to reflect an increasing charge recombination in the photodiodes.55 The higher responsivity of AgNPs-, AuNPs- and AuNRs-mediated devices for blue, green and red light, respectively, was attributed to a photocurrent enhancement based on the plasmonic effect of each sample.
 Fig. 4  Intensity-dependent photocurrent (IPC) measurements of photodiodes without (pristine as reference)/with AgNPs, AuNPs and AuNRs under various blue (450 nm), green (525 nm) and red (620 nm) light intensities, respectively. Photocurrent values were taken at a voltage of −0.5 V. 
Linear dynamic range (LDR) is calculated for a better evaluation of the linearity of the photocurrent versus the incident light intensity, usually considering the current noise.56,57 Based on the above assumption for D* calculation, LDR can be also given by5,8 (3)where Jph* is the photocurrent under the light intensity of 1 mW cm−2. Determined LDR values for AgNPs-, AuNPs- and AuNRs-mediated devices (pristine as comparison in parenthesis) are 58.5 (56.5), 61.1 (57.3) and 64.3 (58.9) dB under blue, green and red illumination, respectively. LDR increase in plasmon-mediated photodiodes is mainly attributed to the higher photocurrent.
To compare the photocurrent response and evaluate the repeatability of pristine and plasmon-mediated devices, several on/off switching cycles of blue, green or red light illumination were implemented. Fig. 5a displays the photocurrent time response curve under red on/off switching illumination with a light intensity of 15 mW cm−2 and an on/off interval of 10 s. It can be seen that the photocurrent of each device is consistent and repeatable, indicating the excellent photoresponse stability. A similar result obtained from on/off switching cycles of blue and green light illumination is shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). Compared to the pristine photodiode, all plasmon-mediated devices have a remarkable photocurrent enhancement corresponding to their respective plasmon resonant wavelength, which is matched with the results in Fig. 3a. The normalized photocurrent response is shown in Fig. 5b, from which the photocurrent decay in the pristine device is more obvious than those in the plasmon-mediated ones during the process of continuous light illumination, further verifying the SPR-enhanced photocurrent. The response speed is another key parameter to determine the capability of a photodetector. The rise time (τr) and fall time (τf), defined as the time between 10% and 90% of maximum photocurrent, are both shorter than 4 ms for each device (Fig. 5c). It is indicated that the introduction of plasmonic nanostructures can enhance the photocurrent without sacrificing the fast response time. In Fig. 5d and Fig. S14 (ESI†), the device stability was evaluated by exposing the devices to air and illuminating under red, green and blue light, respectively. It can be seen that the plasmon-mediated devices have a better long-term stable photoresponse especially for the light overlapped with their respective plasmon resonant wavelengths. The observed photocurrent values varying with time are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).

The photodiodes were stored in air over ten days and the recorded photocurrent values are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). All devices were measured in air. 
Mechanism of SPR-enhanced photocurrent
With low dark current density, a selective enhancement of photoresponse mainly results from the contribution of a photocurrent increase in the plasmon resonant wavelength region. During the DET process, hot electrons surrounding the surface of plasmonic nanostructures can inject into the conduction band (CB) of adjacent ZnO semiconductors and even into the active layer.58 The injected electrons can be driven to the cathode under a reversed voltage, increasing the photocurrent.
Herein we intend to shed some light on the contribution of the NFE process on the SPR-enhanced photocurrent mechanism. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence of P3HT films, in the presence or absence of plasmonic nanostructures, were accordingly acquired. As the P3HT film absorption is located in the 400–650 nm spectral range, the excitation wavelength (λex) could be adjusted to the SPR band of AgNP, AuNP and AuNR (Fig. S15a, ESI†). Fig. 6a shows the steady-state fluorescence spectra of pristine and plasmon-included P3HT films at λex = 520 nm. With all nanomaterials a photoluminescence enhancement was notable. AuNRs revealed the highest photoluminescence increase following an overlap of the longitudinal band with the 0–0 transition emission peak (∼650 nm) of the P3HT film. The emission profiles of AgNPs and AuNPs were tentatively attributed to the corresponding absorbance fingerprint of each nanomaterial (Fig. S3c, ESI†). In accordance, when a λex = 440 nm is applied, AgNPs inversely exhibit a higher emission compared with the AuNPs (Fig. S15b, ESI†). Time-resolved fluorescence spectra further revealed a decrease of the exciton lifetime in the presence of plasmon-included P3HT films, indicating an increase in radiative velocity and subsequently an increase in the emission intensity (Fig. 6b).39,59–61 It is believed that local electromagnetic fields generated around the excited plasmonic nanoparticles can induce semiconductor excitation and radiation.
 Fig. 6  The steady-state (a) and time-resolved (b) fluorescence spectra of P3HT films (pristine as reference) including AgNPs, AuNPs and AuNRs, with a ZnO layer as the spacer. The details of P3HT films’ absorption and emission spectra under different excitation wavelengths are shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†). 
The plasmonic NFE effect is hence concluded to induce and accelerate the excitation and radiation of semiconductors. For the P3HT:PCBM blend as the photoresponsive material in the photodetector, NFE-induced excitation will promote the electron generation contributing to the photocurrent. For a better illustration of the SPR-enhanced photocurrent mechanism the latter is schematized in Fig. 7. A comprehensive description of the working mechanism of the SPR-enhanced photocurrent is shown as below. In the absence of plasmonic nanoparticles, the photocurrent contribution is solely attributed to photoexcitation (Fig. 7a). When plasmonic nanoparticles are introduced, NFE-induced excitation and DET can benefit a further increase in the photocurrent besides the photoexcitation (Fig. 7b). Fig. 7c illustrates the varying photocurrent contributions indicated above. When working in the photovoltaic mode, plasmon-mediated devices also exhibit higher short-circuit current (Jsc), thereby resulting in a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) (Fig. S16 and Table S2, ESI†).

To confirm the NFE effect of these nanoparticles and nanorods, an FDTD simulation was carried out. As shown in Fig. 8, it is clearly observed that a strong field enhancement was generated and scattered around the AgNP, AuNP and AuNR at the wavelengths of 450, 520 and 650 nm, respectively, which reflects the stronger near-field enhancement induced by the plasmonic structures. A stronger field can contribute to the generation of more excitons in the active layer by dissipating higher energy.62,63 According to the above studies, both the experimental and theoretical results show that the partial increase in photocurrent is ascribed to the NFE-induced excitation.

Conclusions
Herein we evaluated the effect of the shape and amount of coupled noble metal nanomaterials on the performance of polymer photodiodes. Optimized amounts of Ag and Au nanoparticles, and Au nanorods were introduced onto ITO substrates, which manipulated the SPR bands of each noble metal nanostructure, selectively located in blue (380–470 nm), green (480–570 nm) and red (580–670 nm) light spectral ranges, respectively. Reversed dark current suppression in the presence of ZnO established the ideal groundwork to focus the investigation of the plasmonic effect on photocurrent enhancement. Compared to the pristine photodiode, AgNPs-, AuNPs- and AuNRs-mediated devices revealed maximum enhancement of photocurrent values by 46, 49 and 65% under blue (450 nm), green (525 nm) and red (620 nm) light illumination, respectively, directly resulting in their corresponding responsivity up to 211, 267 and 253 mA W−1, which is even comparable to that of commercial silicon photodetectors. Specific detectivity values also exhibited a maximal improvement of 39, 30 and 54%, respectively. It is also worth noting that the LDR of photodiodes could be improved due to SPR-enhanced photocurrent and all devices showed excellent photoresponse stability and speed by on/off switching illumination. A wavelength-selective enhanced photoresponse has been demonstrated in polymer photodiodes via the plasmonic effect, which is believed to pave the way for interest in plasmon-mediated photodetectors as promising candidates for challenging high-performance and wavelength-selectable photodetection applications.
Experimental section
Synthesis of AgNPs (∼15 nm), AuNPs (∼20 nm) and AuNRs (∼40/80 nm)
AgNPs were synthesized by employing both sodium borohydride (NaBH4, Aldrich, 99%) and sodium citrate (Aldrich, 99%) as the reductants, and proceeding at two different temperatures of 60 and 90 °C. 5.5 mg of NaBH4 and 44.9 mg of sodium citrate were dissolved in 144 mL of deionized water. The mixed solution was heated at 60 °C for 30 min in the dark with vigorous stirring. 6 mL of 1 mM silver nitrate (AgNO3, Aldrich, >99.8%) solution was then added drop-wise to the mixture and the temperature raised to 90 °C. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 10.5 using 0.1 M NaOH while heating was continued for 20 min, until the color of the solution changed to light yellow. The diameter size of the AgNPs was ∼15 nm.
For the synthesis of AuNPs, a solution of 148.5 mL of deionized water and 1.5 mL of 25.4 mM gold(III) chloride hydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O, Aldrich, 99.999%) was heated at 130 °C under vigorous stirring, in a 250 mL round bottom flask. 0.8 mL of a sodium citrate aqueous solution (50 mg mL−1) was then rapidly added, and the solution boiled for an additional 20 min under continuous stirring. The AuNPs displayed a wine red coloration with around 20 nm diameter.
AuNRs were synthesized as described elsewhere.64 A seed solution for AuNR growth was firstly prepared by mixing 2.5 mL of 0.5 mM HAuCl4 with 2.5 mL of 0.2 M hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, Aldrich, >99%) in a 10 mL scintillation vial. 0.3 mL of 0.01 M NaBH4, diluted to 0.5 mL with deionized water, was then injected into the Au(III)–CTAB solution under vigorous stirring. The seed solution was aged at room temperature for 30 min. For the growth solution, 1.8 g of CTAB and 308.6 mg of sodium oleate (NaOL, TCI, 97%) were dissolved in 50 mL of warm water (∼50 °C) in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The solution was allowed to cool down to 30 °C and 3.6 mL of 4 mM AgNO3 solution was added. The mixture was kept undisturbed at 30 °C for 15 min after which 50 mL of 1 mM HAuCl4 solution was added. When after 30 min the solution became colorless, 0.3 mL of HCl (37 wt% in water) was added to adjust the pH. Following 15 min of stirring, 0.25 mL of 0.064 M L-ascorbic acid (AA, Aldrich, >99%) was added and the solution was vigorously stirred for 30 s. Finally, 0.08 mL of seed solution was injected into the growth solution. The resultant mixture was stirred for 30 s and left to rest at 30 °C for 12 h. The final product was isolated by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 15 min followed by removal of the supernatant. The procedure was repeated for a better separation. The average width/length of the obtained AuNRs was ∼40/80 nm.
Device fabrication
ITO glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in acetone, detergent, deionized water and isopropyl alcohol sequentially. For AgNPs and AuNPs (citrate-covered negative surface) deposition, the substrate surface was treated with oxygen plasma for 10 min. The negatively-charged surface was then converted to positive by dipping into 2 wt% poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA, Aldrich, 20 wt% in H2O) polyelectrolyte solution for 30 min. The positively charged ITO substrate was immersed into AgNPs or AuNPs suspension to achieve the AgNPs- or AuNPs-modified surface. For AuNRs (CTAB-covered positive surface) deposition, the substrate surface was treated with a mixture of 28 wt% ammonia, 35 wt% hydrogen peroxide and deionized water (1:1:5, volume ratio) at 80 °C for 30 min and converted to negative; and then the substrate was immersed into the AuNRs suspension to achieve the AuNRs-modified surface. A ZnO precursor was prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dehydrate (Aldrich, 99.999%, 1 g) and ethanolamine (Aldrich, 99.5%, 0.28 g) in 2-methoxyethanol (Aldrich, 99.8%, 10 mL) under vigorous stirring for 24 h for the hydrolysis reaction in air. The precursor solution was then spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 60 s. After an annealing process in air at 200 °C for 1 h, the thickness of the ZnO layer was estimated to be ∼25 nm. For polymer photodiodes, poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) with >99.95% purity were purchased from Rieke Metals and Nano-C, respectively. An active layer composed of 2.3 wt% P3HT:PCBM blend (1:1) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene was spin casted at 500 rpm for 5 s and 900 rpm for 5 s, sequentially, in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The wet film was naturally dried in a covered glass petri dish, and was then annealed at 120 °C for 10 min, resulting in a thickness of ∼270 nm. A 6 nm-thick molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and 80 nm-thick silver (Ag) electrode were sequentially deposited on the active layer in a vacuum (<10−6 Torr) thermal evaporator. The resulting overlap between the cathode and anode defined a 6 mm2 pixel area.
Characterization techniques
Absorbance was measured using an Agilent Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer. Photoluminescence was measured using an LS 55 fluorescence spectrometer. Time-resolved fluorescence was performed using a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system. The second harmonic (SHG 1/4 400 nm) of a tunable Ti:sapphire laser (Mira900, Coherent) with a 150 femtosecond pulse width and a 76 MHz repetition rate was used as the excitation source. The PL emissions were spectrally resolved by the use of collection optics and a monochromator (SP-2150i, Acton). A TCSPC module (PicoHarp, PicoQuant) with a microchannel plate-photomultiplier tube (MCP-PMT, R3809U-59, Hamamatsu) was used for ultrafast detection. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a Dimension 3100 scanning force microscope in tapping mode (Digital Instrument). Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded using an IviumStat.XR Analyser. Light J–V curves were recorded with a ModuLight-module containing blue (450 nm), green (525 nm) and red (620 nm) LEDs. The sinewave generator of an Ivium potentiostat could then be used to modulate the intensity of the LED with a frequency of 10 μHz–2 MHz. The J–V characteristics of the polymer solar cells were measured under simulated AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 using a POLARONIX® K101 LAB20 Photovoltaic Powermeter. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a K3100 HS Technology Inc. measurement system with bias light. An FDTD simulation was carried out using Lumerical Solution software. The mesh size was set at 0.5 nm for the elaborate design. The plane wave source was used as incident light. z and x were considered to be the light incident direction and the polarization direction, respectively.
