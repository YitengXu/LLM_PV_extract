The effect of oxygen vacancies on the physicochemical properties of metal oxide semiconductors has attracted considerable attention in the photocatalysis field. But so far, the impact of oxygen vacancies on charge carrier transfer for photoelectrochemical water splitting has been unclear. In this work, TiO2 photoanodes with various oxygen vacancy concentrations were studied as metal oxide models to clarify the impact of oxygen vacancies on charge carrier transfer behaviors. The potential distribution and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results indicate that the oxygen vacancies facilitate charge carrier diffusion in TiO2, but are disadvantageous for the charge carrier drift in the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The TiO2-400 photoanode with intermediate oxygen vacancy concentration exhibits the highest photocurrent density. It is expected that this work will provide reference to design and fabricate oxide semiconductors as photoanodes for higher charge carrier utilization in the field of solar-to-chemical energy conversion.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting presents a promising pathway to produce hydrogen fuel with high conversion efficiency in the photocatalysis field.1–3 Particularly, photoanodes are more crucial for PEC water splitting cells due to the sluggish water oxidation dynamics in the anodic region.4–6 TiO2 has been recognized as a representative semiconductor for the photoanode materials. Nevertheless, the large band gap and poor charge carrier mobility of TiO2 limit its PEC performance.7–9 Various methods have been developed to improve the PEC properties of TiO2: metal or nonmetal doping to improve light absorption;10,11 controlling the morphology or crystal facets of TiO2-based semiconductors to enhance the charge separation efficiency;12–15 and building TiO2/narrow bandgap semiconductors to enhance the charge carrier generation and migration abilities.16–21 The PEC performance of TiO2 photoanodes improved remarkably relative to the pristine state. However the STH efficiency at the current level still cannot satisfy the practical requirements, and it is still a challenge to explore high-efficiency photoanodes.
Introducing oxygen vacancies etc. as defects, which can alter the intrinsic photochemical properties of metal oxide semiconductors, has been a frequently used technique in the TiO2 and other metal oxide semiconductor synthesis field. For example, the preparation of black TiO2 in a reducing atmosphere at a high temperature22,23 and creation of surface oxygen vacancies24,25 have been reported. Due to the diverse types of oxygen vacancies, there is no precise definition for the oxygen vacancies in oxide semiconductors with widespread acceptance.26,27 In photocatalysis and PEC water splitting fields, the oxygen vacancies are generally an integrated description of the point defects of the oxygen atoms in the semiconductors.28–30 But how the oxygen vacancies affect the nature of the semiconductors is unclear, which hinders the rational design and fabrication of PEC photoanodes. Therefore, it is urgent to have a deep understanding of how oxygen vacancies affect the diffusion, drift and reaction of charge carriers in the PEC energy conversion field.
Herein, the impact of oxygen vacancies on charge carrier transfer on a TiO2 photoaonde is rationally discussed. TiO2 was studied as a metal oxide model to clarify the impact of oxygen vacancies on charge carrier transfer behaviors. It is found that the TiO2-400 photoanode with intermediate oxygen vacancy concentration exhibits the highest photocurrent density (1.23 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE). The potential distribution and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results indicate that the oxygen vacancies facilitate the charge carrier diffusion in TiO2, but are disadvantageous for the charge carrier drift in the TiO2/electrolyte interface. This research gives innovative views to understand the impact of the oxygen vacancies on the charge carrier transfer by systematic electrochemical testing and provides reference to design and fabricate oxide semiconductor photoelectrodes in the PEC water splitting field.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of TiO2 photoanodes with various oxygen vacancy concentrations
The pristine TiO2 photoanode was prepared on a treated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate by the reported hydrothermal method.31 Typically, 12 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid was fully mixed with 12 mL of redistilled water. 0.34 mL of tetrabutyl titanate was slowly added in the above solution under continuous agitation. After stirring for 15 min, the mixed solution was transferred into a prepared Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. A clean FTO substrate (2 cm × 5 cm) with the conductive surface facing down was put in the Teflon-lined autoclave in advance. Then, the autoclave was sealed and put in an oven at 150 °C for 16 h. After cooling down, the FTO substrate was removed and rinsed with redistilled water. The TiO2 photoanodes with various oxygen vacancy concentrations were finally obtained by annealing at 300 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C or 600 °C for 2 h in a muffle oven. The obtained TiO2 samples were denoted as TiO2-300, TiO2-400, TiO2-500, and TiO2-600, respectively.
2.2 Characterization
The morphology was investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Zeiss SUPRA 55) with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded using a Hitachi H-800 TEM with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku XRD-6000 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with a scan step of 10° min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Thermo VG ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer at a pressure of ∼2 × 10−9 Pa using Al Kα X-ray as the excitation source. Raman spectra were collected on a LabRAM ARAMIS Raman system using a 532 nm laser as the excitation source. Solid UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra were collected on a Shimadzu U-3000 spectrophotometer. EPR data were measured at room temperature on a Bruker E500 Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectrometer.
2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements
All PEC water splitting performances were investigated on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660e, CH Instruments Inc., Shanghai) at room temperature in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The illumination source was a 150 W Xe lamp under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation with a power density of 100 mW cm−2. The obtained TiO2 photoanodes as working electrodes, the platinum net as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode (if any) were installed in a quartz cell. The photocurrent was measured by cyclic voltammetry or linear sweep voltammetry at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1.
The open-circuit voltage of TiO2 was measured under dark and illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) with a two-electrode cell. The open-circuit voltage of the TiO2 photoanode was considered as steady until ΔEo < 0.005 V at the last 100 s.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out by applying a selected AC voltage with frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 1 Hz under illumination. At a relatively low current (0.2 mA cm−2 was selected in this work), it is easier to distinguish the internal and surface charge transfer resistances according to the EIS results. The EIS applied bias potential of the four TiO2 samples was measured by a galvanostatic method. An electrical equivalent circuit model with resistors (R) and capacitors (C) was fitted using the ZView software according to the measured EIS results.
3. Results and discussion
The preparation process of TiO2 nanoarrays with various oxygen vacancy concentrations is illustrated in Fig. 1a. The pristine TiO2 cubic nanorods with a diameter of ∼150 nm (Fig. 1b) were vertically grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) via a hydrothermal method,31 which was further confirmed by the TEM images (Fig. S1†). Then the oxygen vacancy concentrations of TiO2 can be controlled by modulating the calcination temperature from 300 °C to 600 °C in air (the samples are denoted as TiO2-300, TiO2-400, TiO2-500 and TiO2-600). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the four TiO2 samples display ordered perpendicular nanorod arrays (Fig. S2†), which inherit the morphological features of pristine TiO2. The side view SEM images of the four TiO2 samples confirm the adhesion of the nanorods on the FTO substrate (Fig. S3†). Three peaks at 36.1°, 62.7° and 69.8° can be observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the four samples (Fig. 1c), corresponding to the (101), (002) and (112) diffraction peaks of rutile TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-1276), respectively. The similar SEM images and XRD patterns demonstrate that the morphologies and crystal structures of the TiO2 samples are unaltered after the calcination process. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the four TiO2 photoanodes exhibit a steep absorption edge at approximately 410 nm and the bandgap is calculated to be ∼3.04 eV through the Tauc analyses (Fig. S4†).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to estimate the surface electronic structures of the TiO2 samples. The full survey spectra of the four TiO2 samples reveal signals of C, Ti, and O elements (Fig. S5†). Fig. 2a shows the O 1s XPS spectra of the TiO2 samples, which were deconvoluted to two peaks at 529.9 and 531.6 eV, corresponding to the oxygen atoms O2− in the lattice and the absorbed –OH group, respectively. The signal of the absorbed –OH group can represent the existence of oxygen vacancies.32,33 It was found that the area proportion of –OH is 28.6%, 24.5%, 21.2%, and 19.0% for TiO2-300, TiO2-400, TiO2-500 and TiO2-600, respectively. This demonstrates that surface oxygen vacancy concentrations gradually declined along with the calcination temperatures. The Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks were observed at 458.6 eV and 464.3 eV for the four TiO2 samples (Fig. 2b), which was in line with the presence of Ti4+ ([BE(Ti 2p3/2) = 458.9 eV; spin–orbit splitting = 5.7 eV]).16,18 The change in the electronic structure of surface Ti was relatively small after the calcination process. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was used to investigate the oxygen vacancy concentrations of the TiO2 samples. The EPR signals with g = 2.006 can be assigned to Ti3+ species (Fig. 2c), which is consistent with previous reports.34,35 The intensity of EPR signals shows a decrease along with the enhanced calcination temperature for TiO2, which indicates that TiO2-400 has an intermediate oxygen vacancy concentration. The Raman spectra of the four TiO2 samples exhibit similar vibrational modes of rutile TiO2 at 445 cm−1 and 608 cm−1 (Fig. S6†), suggesting that the oxygen vacancies do not change the main bonding environment.36,37 The above results demonstrate that the oxygen vacancy concentrations in the TiO2 samples are in the following order: TiO2-300 > TiO2-400 > TiO2-500 > TiO2-600. But the oxygen vacancy concentrations in TiO2 is relatively low, which can be inferred from the similar XRD patterns and UV-vis diffuse reflectance and Raman spectra results for the TiO2 samples.

PEC water splitting measurements of the four TiO2 photoanodes were firstly carried out using a three-electrode electrochemical cell in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 3a, TiO2-400 with intermediate oxygen vacancy concentration exhibits the highest photocurrent density (1.23 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE), compared to TiO2-300, TiO2-500 and TiO2-600 photoanode samples. The on-set potential of TiO2-300 (with the highest oxygen vacancies) was low (∼0.42 V vs. RHE), but the photocurrent density was surpassed by the TiO2-400 and TiO2-500 samples along with the improved bias potential. TiO2-600 (with the lowest oxygen vacancies) displays a positive on-set potential and low photocurrent density. Fig. 3b shows the I–t curves of the four TiO2 samples recorded under chopped light illumination at 1.23 V vs. RHE. For TiO2-300, the current density under illumination became steady after ∼500 s. But the photocurrent density of TiO2-600 can remain in a steady state in the first 25 s. Photo-generated holes can be trapped in the defect site during the transfer process, and so the TiO2 samples return to a steady state quickly as the oxygen vacancy concentrations decrease. The PEC performance of TiO2-400 is superior to most reported studies on TiO2-based photoanodes (the photocurrent densities usually were 0.5–1.2 mA cm−2 at a similar bias, Table S1†).10,11,13,38–40

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to study the impact of oxygen vacancies on the photoanodes.41,42 The charge transfer behaviors in the four TiO2 photoanodes can be precisely explored if working at the same photocurrent density. Chronopotentiometry measurement was carried out to test the applied bias potential at the same current density (J = 0.2 mA cm−2 was selected) before EIS measurement (see the details in the Experimental section). The applied bias voltage at J = 0.2 mA cm−2 was 0.0284 V, 0.0141 V, 0.0736 V, and 0.4642 V (vs. SCE) for TiO2-300, TiO2-400, TiO2-500, and TiO2-600, respectively (Fig. 3c and Fig. S7†). Then the EIS measurement of the four TiO2 samples at the corresponding applied bias was carried out and the measured EIS results are shown in Fig. 3d. An electrical equivalent circuit model (Fig. 3d inset) with resistors (R) and capacitors (C) was used to fit the PEC water splitting process: R1 and C1 are the resistance and capacitance of charge transfer in the internal photoanode; R2 and C2 are the resistance and capacitance of a similar reaction that takes place at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface; and R3 represents the external solution and wire resistance. The fitting Nyquist diagram (Fig. S8†) was obtained according to the measured EIS results and the R and C values of the four TiO2 samples are displayed in Table S2.† For TiO2-400, R1 (30 Ω) and R2 (85 Ω) were smaller than the other samples, suggesting that the internal charge transfer and surface reaction resistance are relatively low. Meanwhile C1 (0.35 × 10–4 F) and C2 (3.5 × 10–4 F) were large due to the intense internal charge carrier diffusion and surface ion adsorption–desorption under these conditions. By comparison with the R of TiO2-500, the R1 of TiO2-300 is smaller (60 Ω vs. 90 Ω), while R2 is larger (160 Ω vs. 90 Ω). This indicates that high oxygen vacancy concentration facilitates the charge carrier diffusion in the internal TiO2, but is disadvantageous for the charge carrier drift in the TiO2/electrolyte interface. TiO2-600 with the lowest oxygen vacancy concentration shows increased R1 and R2 and remarkably decreased C1 and C2 due to the lack of active charge carriers. It is worth mentioning that the migration of charge carriers in TiO2 is interactional, and so the R or C values are not comparable under other conditions.
The impact of oxygen vacancies on the charge transfer behaviors is further studied using a two-electrode electrochemical cell (Fig. 4a). In the dark, electrochemical water splitting cannot be achieved with the four TiO2 samples at low applied bias. Under illumination, TiO2-400 exhibits the best PEC performance with high photocurrent density (1.11 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V) and negative on-set potential (0.69 V vs. cathode). Due to the high oxidation ability of photo-generated holes (valence band at ∼3.0 eV vs. NHE) in TiO2, a low current density can be observed at low applied bias (0–0.7 V). The open-circuit voltage (ΔEo) was measured under dark and light conditions (Fig. 4b and Fig. S9,† see details in the Experimental section). In the dark, the ΔEo of the TiO2 samples between the photoanode (Eanode) and cathode (Ecathode) was from −0.416 V to −0.315 V, suggesting that the potential of the photoanode is negative compared to the cathode. Under illumination, newly generated electrons and holes separated and moved in opposite directions in the semiconductor. The open-circuit voltage ΔEo further decreased to −0.667 V, −0.643 V, −0.636 V, and −0.492 V for TiO2-300, TiO2-400, TiO2-500, and TiO2-600, respectively. The declined Eanode can mainly be attributed to the extension of the diffusion region to the TiO2 inside. The PEC performance of TiO2-300 is inferior compared to TiO2-400, indicating that serious charge carrier recombination occurs in the depletion layer (including the TiO2/electrolyte interface). A further discussion on the relationship between ΔEo and oxygen vacancies is provided in the following part.

The potential distribution (dark red line) on the two-electrode cell is schematically shown in Fig. 4c according to the theoretical and experimental research studies.43,44 The Fermi energy of the electrons in TiO2 is more negative than the redox potential of the electrolyte. When TiO2 is placed in the electrolyte, electric current initially flows across the contact interface. The transfer of electric charge produces a depletion layer in the TiO2 side and a Helmholtz layer (compact layer) in the electrolyte side.45 The photoanode surface potential (Es) is ΔV1 higher than EH2O/O2. The maximum potential (Em) is on the interface of the diffusion region and the depletion layer. The potential difference (Es and Em) in the depletion layer prevents the electron transfer from the photoanode to the electrolyte, while the diffusion currents and drift currents are antidromic and balanced in the diffusion region. The metal cathode surface and internal potential can be considered as consistent, which is ΔV2 lower than EH2O/H2. The ion adsorption on the surface of the four TiO2 samples was similar. Therefore, the Es, Ecathode, ΔV1 and ΔV2 can be considered as keeping constant under measured conditions. EIS results demonstrate that potential distribution in the diffusion region (affects R1 and C1) and depletion layer (affects R2 and C2) plays a key role in the charge transfer in the photoanode. The thickness of the diffusion region and the depletion layer on the TiO2-400 photoanode with intermediate oxygen vacancy concentration should be large, which results in the optimal charge carrier transfer abilities. The Eanode of TiO2-300 was the lowest among the four TiO2 samples, suggesting that a more broad diffusion region exists due to the high intrinsic charge carrier concentration. The depletion layer on TiO2-600 was wide but the diffusion region was narrow. The above results demonstrate that oxygen vacancies in TiO2 facilitate the charge carrier diffusion in the internal TiO2, but are disadvantageous for the charge carrier drift in the TiO2/electrolyte interface.
4. Conclusion
In summary, the PEC water splitting performance of the TiO2 photoanode was seriously affected by the oxygen vacancy concentration. The oxygen vacancy concentrations of TiO2 decreased as the calcination temperature increased from 300 °C to 600 °C. The TiO2-400 photoanode with intermediate oxygen vacancy concentration displays the highest photocurrent density (1.23 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE), which can be ascribed to the relatively excellent charge carrier diffusion ability in the internal TiO2 and charge carrier drift ability in the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The impacts of oxygen vacancies in TiO2 indicate that appropriate defects should be considered in the semiconductor synthesis. Semiconductor doping may inhibit the photochemical performance if the lattice distortion reduces the charge carrier migration abilities. The provided methods can be extended to study the charge carrier transfer abilities of congeneric photoelectrodes. This work provides reference to design and fabricate oxide semiconductors as photoanodes for higher charge carrier utilization in the field of solar-to-chemical energy conversion.
