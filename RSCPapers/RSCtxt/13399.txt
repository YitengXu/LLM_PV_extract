    , Accepted 14th February 2022First published on 15th February 2022AbstractLanthanide-doped phosphors with persistent luminescence have attracted much interest owing to their unique “self-luminescing” feature and broad potential applications. Among all lanthanide ions, Pr3+ exhibits versatile persistent luminescence in a wide spectral range (from ultraviolet, visible to infrared) due to its manipulable 4f5d → 4f2 inter-configurational and 4f2 → 4f2 intra-configurational emission transitions in appropriately designed host matrices. However, no effort has been made to provide a comprehensive overview of Pr3+-activated persistent phosphors so far. Here, to provide some guidelines for the future development of persistent phosphors and to expand their potential applications, we have concisely summarized Pr3+-activated visible (especially red), infrared, and UV persistent luminescence in different types of host matrices. Based on the investigated Pr3+-activated persistent phosphors, plausible mechanisms of Pr3+-activated red/visible, infrared, and UV persistent luminescence were briefly discussed. We have further discussed the potential of Pr3+-activated red and infrared persistent phosphors as potential luminescent probes in night-vision surveillance and bio-imaging. The more recently reported UVC and dual UVC-UVB persistent phosphors activated by Pr3+ have boosted exciting applications beyond the capabilities of red/infrared persistent phosphors, including the distant tagging and tracking of Pr3+-activated persistent phosphor-labelled targets in bright environments. Finally, a few perspectives for Pr3+-activated persistent phosphors are highlighted. The upconverted persistent luminescence of Pr3+ is one future path towards more application possibilities. It is expected that this review will further motivate scientists to explore new desirable persistent phosphors and their potential applications along with understanding their composition–structure–property relationship.

1. Introduction
Persistent luminescence (PersL) is a phenomenon where a material consistently emits for an appreciable time (generally, minutes to days) after optical excitation is ceased.1 The optical excitation is typically from ultraviolet (UV) light or other higher-energy radiations such as vacuum UV and X-ray, while in other cases visible light is also used as an irradiation source. During the optical excitation (charging), excited carriers are captured and stored at variously distributed trapping centers (a charged point defect or an impurity) surrounding luminescent ions until their escape to the electron–hole recombination center, which finally causes delayed emission.
The first direct observation of the PersL phenomenon was made over 1000 years ago, from an ancient Chinese self-luminescing painting of a cow, drawn with inks generated from a mixture of pearl shells and volcanic ash.2 However, the earliest commercialized persistent phosphors, chalcogenide (sulfide and selenide)-based persistent phosphors, e.g., ZnS:Cu2+,(Co2+)3,4 and CdS:Cu2+,5 were successfully developed in the 20th century. Most of them were used as self-luminous (“glow-in-the-dark”) paints but exhibited a weak and short (< 2 h) visible PersL.6 The discovery of a much more robust and longer-decayed green persistent phosphor, SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+, by Matsuzawa7 in 1996 marks the beginning of a new era for persistent phosphors. Since then, an increasing number of persistent phosphors using either lanthanide ions or transition metal ions as PersL emitters have emerged at an accelerated pace,8–13 among which the well-known ones are Eu2+-activated persistent phosphors in the visible spectral region (350–700 nm)14,15 and Cr3+-activated persistent phosphors in the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region (> 700 nm).16–20 Afterwards, a few SWIR persistent phosphors were developed, including SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+,Er3+ (1530 nm, > 10 min),21 Zn3Ga2Ge2O10:Ni2+ (1290 nm, > 10 h),22 Y3Al2Ga3O12:Er3+,Ce3+,Cr3+ (1532 nm, > 10 h),23 and MgGeO3:Yb3+ (∼1000 nm, > 100 h).24
With much advancement in the persistent luminescence field, there increasingly emerge efforts on comprehensive reviews of persistent phosphors and their mechanisms. Some discussions focus on a brief history of the development of all persistent phosphors;1,25,26 others endeavor to overview persistent phosphors either activated by specific types of luminescent ions (such as lanthanide ions27–29 and transition metal ions30,31) or exhibiting PersL at specific spectral wavelengths (usually red and IR32,33). The discussion of persistent phosphors for certain applications is also popular.34–37
Motivated by the development of these excellent visible and infrared (IR) persistent phosphors, Pr3+-activated persistent phosphors have also been lately investigated and burgeoned. Fig. 1 shows the published studies related to Pr3+ PersL in recent years. Pr3+ is featured with a 4f2 shell and thanks to the 13 multiplets in the Pr3+ 4f2 configuration and non-4f states, Pr3+ exhibits varied luminescence behaviors in different host lattices, from UV, visible to IR, which provides a favorable condition for the realization of a wider range of PersL colors and potential applications.38,39 As far as we know, Pr3+ is also the first reported single luminescent ion that shows ultraviolet-C (UVC) persistent luminescence40,41 in a host and red/IR/short-wave infrared (SWIR) persistent luminescence in another.12 Despite the flexibility of Pr3+ as a persistent emitter in a full spectral range, an inclusive view of all known Pr3+ persistent phosphors has not been provided yet.

Fig. 2a depicts the energy diagrams of Pr3+ 4f2 manifolds and a variable non-4f state:4f5d state with local crystal environments. The 4f2 multiplets are 1S0, 3PJ, 1D2, etc. Their energy levels are stable in different hosts thanks to the protection from the 5s and 5p orbitals. The emission transitions from 1S0, 3PJ and 1D2 can produce UV, visible, and IR emissions, respectively. The position of the Pr3+ 4f5d state is generally above the 3P2 level (∼22530 cm−1) but can be varied largely either above or beneath the 1S0 state (∼46986 cm−1) depending on the lattice stiffness and other crystal field effects from the host. The electronic transitions are also affected by such a variation. This review only discusses the conditions when the Pr3+ 4f5d state is beneath the 1S0 state. Based on the assumption, there are roughly two types of emission transitions in Pr3+, 4f2 → 4f2 intra-configurational emission transitions and 4f5d → 4f2 inter-configurational emission transition.42 The partially allowed electric dipole transitions of Pr3+ within the 4f2 configurations (from different emissive energy levels) result from uneven crystal-field terms in crystals.

Here, Fig. 2a presents three types of emission transition possibilities in Pr3+ from 4f5d, 3PJ, and 1D2 emissive levels when the excitation transition from the ground state to Pr3+ 4f5d is enabled. The corresponding emission spectra are explained using example phosphors in Fig. 2b, c and d, respectively.
The allowed electric-dipole 4f2 → 4f5d inter-configurational transition can also directly generate the parity allowed 4f5d → 4f2 broadband emission in the UV region, although emission energy varies in different host lattices (for example, YPO4:Pr3+, YBO3:Pr3+, and Y2SiO5:Pr3+ in Fig. 2b, and others45), while in others, nonradiative 4f5d → 4f2 relaxation is enabled if the 4f5d state overlaps lower energy states, such as 3PJ or even 1D2, in the 4f2 configuration. In the latter case, upon ultraviolet excitation, a radiative transition from the 4f5d excited state is substantially or completely quenched; instead, visible (multicolor, blue, or red) emissions from the lower 4f2 excited states (3PJ, 1D2 emissive levels) dominate, leading to a white color (the meanwhile blue, green, and yellow) emission44 as shown in Fig. 1c or deep red and IR emissions12 as shown in Fig. 2d, respectively. Particularly, the deep red/IR emissions from the Pr3+ 1D2 excited state are usually reported in Pr3+-doped transition metal compounds with a d0 cation (Ti4+, Zr4+, Nb4+, V5+, Ta5+, Cr6+, Mo6+, etc.) electronic structure. The “intervalence charge transfer” (IVCT) model well explains the phenomena.46 Except for d0 compounds, Pr3+ in YPO447 and others also exhibits red emission thanks to the multi-phonon relaxation process originating from 3P0 to 1D2.
Due to the wide spectral range of luminescence properties, previous studies on Pr3+ photoluminescence are numerous but the investigation of Pr3+ PersL is in a very limited number. This is mainly because the PersL mechanism for Pr3+-activated phosphors still remains ambiguous. The manipulable Pr3+ emissions from UV, visible to IR still open a route for researchers to explore more high-performance Pr3+-activated persistent phosphors. To our best knowledge, an overall discussion of Pr3+ PersL behaviors, the underlying mechanisms and growing applications has not been conducted. Herein, we investigate the steady progress in the development of Pr3+-activated persistent phosphors in a broad emissive range, from visible, IR, to UV. The previously reported red, IR and UV persistent phosphors for Pr3+ in different host types are summarized, respectively. The plausible mechanisms and potential applications are examined with respect to different Pr3+ PersL behaviors in these hosts. Meanwhile, the current challenges and future perspectives in Pr3+ persistent phosphors are provided in this review. For example, the upconverted charging process and upconverted PersL of Pr3+ are included in the discussion.
2. Classification of Pr3+-activated persistent phosphors
The versatile luminescence behaviors of Pr3+ in different spectral regions, from UV to IR, indicate the potential of Pr3+ as a PersL emitter for a single color or multicolor PersL in a wide spectral range according to application requirements. The two decisive factors are (1) emission transitions of Pr3+ and (2) effective charge carrier trapping centers in host materials. Here, we summarized and classified previously reported Pr3+ red/IR/UV PersL phenomena in different types of host compounds based on their PersL emission wavelength range. Some of them are discussed in-depth with respect to the relationship between lattice structure and Pr3+ PersL performance, which assists us in finding out the mechanisms and potential of Pr3+ as a PersL emitter later.
2.1 Red/other visible persL
While strong and long-lasting green and blue persistent phosphors represented by SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+ (green, > 30 h; ref. 7) and CaAl2O4:Eu2+,Nd3+ (blue, > 10 h; ref. 48) were firstly successfully developed and commercialized in night-vision displays in various outdoor and indoor applications, PersL in red and other visible counterparts is still unsatisfactory due to their inferior afterglow brightness and afterglow duration. Typical red and other visible persistent phosphors are sulfides, oxysulfides, and nitrides such as Y2O2S:Eu3+,Mg2+,Ti4+ (at 627 nm, ∼3 h in the light perception of dark-adapted human eyes at 0.32 mcd m−2)49 and Ca2Si5N8:Eu2+ (at 620 nm, > 15 min).50 In addition to inadequate PersL duration, chemical instability from humidity and other extreme conditions also encumbered the commercial use of these red and, in general, visible persistent phosphors. Therefore, much interest has been focused in developing chemically stable, intense and long-lasting red and other visible PersL phosphors, especially, in oxide compounds.17,51–55
Based on the capability of 1D2 emission, Pr3+ has been studied in the past decade as a deep red PersL emitter in appropriate oxide hosts. Up to now, many Pr3+-doped red persistent phosphors have been reported. Table 1 lists the previously studied Pr3+-activated red persistent phosphors due to Pr3+ 1D2 → 3HJ emission transitions in the host materials upon irradiation by UV light in the range of 250–360 nm, including CaTiO3:Pr3+,56–66 NaNbO3:Pr3+,54,67 CdSiO3:Pr3+,12,68,69 Ca2SnO4:Pr3+,70,71 and YPO4:Pr3+.72 Through 1D2 → 3HJ electronic transition, Pr3+ ion usually emits at ∼612 nm, an ideal red color for various color display technologies. The decay time of the red PersL can vary from several minutes to more than a hundred hours, based on Pr3+ performance in different hosts.

As mentioned above, red emissions from the Pr3+ 1D2 excited state are usually reported in Pr3+-doped transition metal compounds with a d0 cation (Ti4+, Zr4+, Nb4+, V5+, Ta5+, Cr6+, Mo6+, etc.) electronic structure. The typical Pr3+ red PersL example here is Pr3+-doped CaTiO3 with a perovskite structure. The luminescence and afterglow mechanisms of CaTiO3:Pr3+ have been gradually investigated and better understood in the last decade.56–66,73–76 The energy dynamics of Pr3+ in CaTiO3 is illustrated via a configuration coordinate scheme in Fig. 3a. Upon UV excitation (transitions 1), excited electrons are transferred directly to the meta-stable 1D2 state through transitions 2 and 3 due to their cross coupling with the CTS: Pr3+–O–Ti4+ to Pr4+–O–Ti3+, which leads to a populated 1D2 state and a steady-state red emission through transition 4: 1D2 → 3H4 at room temperature. The CTS is known as the IVCT state. A trapping state is hypothesized just below the CTS level, as the red PersL is associated with the electron trapping process and thermal activation of excited electrons stored in trapping centers.

The endeavors for the red PersL efficiency in (Ca, Sr, Ba)TiO3:Pr3+ were sparked as the bandgap and IVCT energies vary with the compositional modification in this solid solution.112,113 Katayama et al.59 discussed the difference in the processes of PersL due to the band-to-band, IVCT and 3H4 → 3PJ excitations and explained the mechanism of PersL in (Ca,Sr)TiO3:Pr3+. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the band-to-band, IVCT and 3H4 → 3PJ bands all contributed to the PersL excitation spectra (Fig. 3b) and (Ca,Sr)TiO3:Pr3+ showed a shorter afterglow with increasing Sr substitution under band-to-band excitation (Fig. 3c). Trapping centers such as  and an associated trap cluster []′ became shallower as to VB with increasing Sr content, which explained that the red afterglow was optimal without Sr substitution at all.
Red PersL of Pr3+ was also investigated in niobates with a perovskite structure and non-perovskite titanates.54,67,84,86 For example, the IVCT mechanism dominates in NaNbO3:Pr3+ at room temperature (300 K), resulting in an intense red luminescence through the 1D2 → 3H4 electronic transition (Fig. 4a). The result was compared to that at 77 K, where the cross-over between 3P0 and the charge transfer state is inappreciable due to lack of thermal activation; thus quenching is inefficient at 77 K. At room temperature, under irradiation at 350 nm in the IVCT band, an electron from Pr3+ was transferred to a nearby Nb5+ ion located at 3.29–3.30 Å from the excited Pr3+. However, due to shallow electron traps possibly induced by charge compensation and other defects, the red afterglow is not strong enough at room temperature (Fig. 4b). At 77 K, NaNbO3:Pr3+ does not show any afterglow as the phonon-assisted delocalization and charge de-trapping require thermal activation. It usually applies to most persistent phosphors at low temperature. Fig. 4c shows the red PersL decay of a non-perovskite titanate Ca3Ti2O7:xPr3+ (x = 0.002–0.02) at 612 nm after irradiation by a 330 nm UV light for 5 min. Similarly, during the decay process, red PersL was intense for the first few seconds but fast faded during the rest of the time (∼15 min, using a spectrometer), even at the optimal Pr3+ concentration (x = 0.005). The afterglow lasts for ∼5 min perceived by dark-adapted human eyes. In the constructed energy level diagram for Ca3Ti2O7:Pr3+ (Fig. 4d) based on the experimental results, electron and hole traps are hypothetically generated upon UV light (330 nm or 375 nm) irradiation, and the electron–hole recombination yields a bright, but not long, red afterglow at 612 nm, though the trap depth varies from 0.69 to 0.92 eV as claimed, which is quite close to the well stated ideal trap depth (0.6–0.7 eV) for PersL.7

To acquire bright and long-lasting red PersL in oxide phosphors, Bessière et al. studied Pr3+-doped YPO4 by designing trapping centers and engineering trap depth through co-doping another lanthanide ion from Nd3+/Er3+/Ho3+/Dy3+.72 In YPO4:Pr3+,Ln3+ (Ln = Nd, Er, Ho, Dy), Y3+ can be easily substituted by any Ln3+. Pr3+ is as always, a radiative recombination center (luminescent center), while at the same time a hole trap, which plays a similar role as Ce3+ in YPO4:Ce3+,Ln3+.
In addition to YPO4:Pr3+, other Pr3+ doped non-d0 compounds such as gallate, germanate, aluminate, silicate, scandate and tantalate show multicolor or white PersL due to the simultaneous emission transitions from 3P0 and 1D2 to ground states of Pr3+. The typical Pr3+ doped white persistent phosphors are Sr2SiO4:Pr3+55,107 and Lu3Al2Ga3O12:Pr3+.110
2.2 IR PersL
As far as we know, since the 1990s, there has been rapid emergence of new PersL materials with emission in IR, which thus increasingly prompts their applications in “glow-in-the-dark” lighting and displays, anticounterfeiting, and in vivo bioimaging. In addition to Cr3+, NIR and SWIR PersL of lanthanide ions, including Ho3+, Pr3+, Yb3+, Nd3+, Er3+, and Tm3+, was investigated according to their versatile emission transitions in 4f levels.71 Several Pr3+-doped PersL materials were studied. Table 2 lists the previously studied Pr3+-activated IR persistent phosphors due to Pr3+ 1D2 → 3H5,6, 3FJ and 1G4 → 3H4 emission transitions in the host materials.

Here, we discuss both NIR and SWIR emission and PersL properties of Pr3+ as they are attributed to the electronic transitions from the same Pr3+ 1D2 level. Generally, Pr3+ IR PersL is derived from possible optical emission transitions including its 1D2 → 3H5 transition at ∼720 nm (NIR), 1D2 → 3H6 transition at ∼900 nm (NIR), and 1D2 → 3F3,4 transition at ∼1080 nm (SWIR).
Liang et al.12 developed red/NIR/SWIR multi-band persistent phosphors by doping Pr3+ into MgGeO3 (Fig. 5a) and CdSiO3 hosts, which emitted intense, very-long-lasting (> 120 h) PersL at around 625 nm, 900 nm and 1085 nm at room temperature after 254 nm UV irradiation was ceased. PersL can only be achieved from the MgGeO3:Pr3+ phosphor by high-energy UV light excitation. As reported, the intensity ratio of the 625 nm/900 nm/1085 nm persistent emissions remained constant at different decay times, implying that the 625 nm, 900 nm and 1085 nm persistent emissions from the 1D2 emitting state of Pr3+ exhibited the same decay behavior. After a very long decay, for instance, 60 h, the PersL at 625 nm was still significant, as shown in the PersL emission spectrum at 60 h (Fig. 5a) and decay curve monitored at 625 nm at 60 h (Fig. 5b).

The phosphors were irradiated using a 254 nm UV lamp for 10 min. The decay curves were acquired by monitoring emissions of Er3+ at 1533 nm, Yb3+ at 1000 nm, Pr3+ at 1115 nm, Nd3+ at 1080 nm, Ho3+ at 1180 nm, and Tm3+ at 1195 nm, (e and f) reproduced with permission from ref. 71. Copyright 2017 Royal Chemical Society. 
The Ca2SnO4:Pr3+ phosphor also shows NIR and SWIR PersL at ∼925 nm and ∼1115 nm for Pr3+ after UV irradiation at 254 nm for 10 min71 (Fig. 5e). The PersL decay was recorded up to 1 h. Its decay kinetics was also compared to that of other phosphors with SWIR PersL using Er3+, Yb3+, Nd3+, Ho3+, or Tm3+ as a luminescent ion and Ca2SnO4 as the host material (Fig. 5f). After 1 h of continuous emission, the SWIR PersL intensity of the Ca2SnO4:Pr3+ phosphor was still significantly high and was at the same magnitude as those of the MgGeO3:Yb3+ phosphor, the afterglow of which could last for about 100 h.
2.3 UV PersL
Studies on phosphors capable of PersL at the short-wavelength (high-energy) end of the spectrum, UV (200–400 nm) spectral range, especially UVC (200–280 nm, “solar-blind”), have remained silent until very recently. To our best knowledge, only a few persistent phosphors have been reported emitting in the UV range, including UVA (320–400 nm) PersL activated by Bi3+,114–122 Pb2+,9 or Tb3+,123 UVB (280–320 nm) PersL activated by Pr3+124,125 or Gd3+126–129 and UVC PersL activated by Pr3+40,41,129–131 or Bi3+129,132 and dual-band UVC and UVB PersL activated by Pr3+.53,133
Due to the high 4f5d energy state (the first case in Fig. 2a), Pr3+ possibly absorbs ultraviolet irradiation via an allowed electric-dipole 4f2 → 4f5d inter-configurational transition. If the excited Pr3+ returns directly from the lowest excited 4f5d state to the 4f2 ground state (the parity-allowed 4f5d → 4f2 emission transition), it emits in the UV range. In this case, Pr3+ UVC (“solar-blind” UV) PersL emissions are expected if Pr3+ is in a suitable site environment with trapping states enabled by the surrounding lattice defects or others. Fig. 2b shows a series of Pr3+-doped UVC phosphors such as Pr3+-doped borates, phosphates and silicates. They all satisfy the creation of high-energy Pr3+ 4f5d states based on their emission maximum in UVC. However, no UVC PersL was reported from these phosphors.
Challenges for developing UVC persistent phosphors are mainly caused by the selection of (1) a persistent luminescent ion with a high emissive energy level responsible for UVC emission after UV or higher-energy optical charging and (2) a suitable phosphor host with a large band gap that can create high-density traps located at significantly high energy position. Due to these challenges, only a few Pr3+-doped UVC persistent phosphors satisfying these aspects have been developed in recent years. Table 3 lists the previously studied Pr3+-activated UV persistent phosphors due to Pr3+ 4f5d → 3HJ emission transitions in the host materials.

Firstly, a Pr3+-doped fluoride-based persistent phosphor, Cs2NaYF6:Pr3+ (Fig. 6), with an UVC PersL for ∼2 h in the dark was reported in 2018.41 In Cs2NaYF6:Pr3+, after X-ray irradiation, the sample displayed a strong, long-lasting UVC PersL peaking at ∼250 nm owing to the 4f5d → 3H4 electronic transition of Pr3+, accompanied by visible bands of 4f2–4f2 intra-configurational transitions (Fig. 6b). To achieve a desirable UVC afterglow (∼2 h) from Cs2NaYF6:Pr3+, a long-time (> 15 min) and high-dose (20 Gy) X-ray irradiation was required (Fig. 6c). However, excitation at 288 nm (UV) cannot result in any afterglow or charging of the material. Speaking of X-ray charging, Cs2NaYF6:Pr3+ was reported earlier as a good X-ray storage phosphor,134 where F-type electron centers and Pr4+ hole trap centers were involved in the information storage and read-out process due to photostimulated luminescence (PSL) at room temperature.

To achieve UVC PersL from Pr3+-activated persistent phosphors by widely available and less harmful light sources, e.g., a standard 254 nm mercury discharge lamp, Pan and his group developed a series of Pr3+-doped UVC persistent oxide phosphors.40 Charged by a “low-energy” 254 nm UV lamp, several phosphors exhibited a relatively long persistence time, e.g., > 10 h. Taking Ca2Al2SiO7:Pr3+ for example, the UVC emission of this Pr3+-activated UVC phosphor is dominated by broad and parity-allowed Pr3+ 4f5d → 4f2 inter-configurational transitions. The nonradiative relaxation of the Pr3+ 4f5d level to lower 4f2 (3PJ, 1I6, 1D2) levels can be minimized upon UV excitation (Fig. 6e). When excitation was ceased, UVC PersL emission at 268 nm for > 12 h was obtained (Fig. 6f). The gray curve in Fig. 5g shows the PersL decay curve of the Ca2Al2SiO7:Pr3+ phosphor at 268 nm in the dark after 254 nm irradiation at room temperature. The PersL intensity was initially high (∼10.9 mW m−2 in radiometric unit) and decreased rapidly in the first 1 h, followed by a long-hour slow decay (> 12 h). The observation of Pr3+ UVC PersL from Ca2Al2SiO7:Pr3+ indicated that energy traps in this material are located at appropriate energy positions and can be effectively filled up by the 254 nm irradiation. The decay performance of Ca2Al2SiO7:Pr3+ persistent phosphor was significantly influenced by the ambient lighting conditions (Fig. 6g). In the dark, the sample decayed slowly and exhibited the longest afterglow duration (> 12 h). In direct sunlight, by contrast, the decay time was much shortened due to two types of luminescence signals: the normal PersL signal due to ambient heat stimulation and the PSL signal due to ambient light stimulation. Specifically, direct sunlight strongly boosted the release of stored energy in Ca2Al2SiO7:Pr3+ and produced a strong PSL signal. Therefore, the decay of the Ca2Al2SiO7:Pr3+ phosphor in direct sunlight can only last for ∼2 h. In indirect sunlight, the decay lasted much longer than that in direct sunlight but was second to the case in room light. Several other UVC persistent phosphors doped by Pr3+ such as Sr3Y2Si6O18:Pr3+, Ca3Al2Si3O12:Pr3+, Lu2SiO5:Pr3+, and LiYSiO4:Pr3+ were also reported in the same work.
Moreover, we recently demonstrated that Pr3+ can be doped into the modified garnet crystal structure to achieve the UVC and UVB dual-band emission and PersL emission.133,135 In the Pr3+-activated (Ca1.5Y1.5)(Al3.5Si1.5)O12, the PersL of Pr3+ is not only at 266 nm but also at 313 nm, and both decays last for ∼12 h. The solar-blind imaging experiments assisted by this phosphor are discussed and other applications based on the dual-band UVC and UVB PersL capabilities are envisioned. As far as we know, it is the first reported dual-band UVC and UVB persistent phosphor.
3. Mechanisms of Pr3+-activated PersL
The PersL behaviors activated by Pr3+ are varied from one host to the other, and are closely related to their PersL mechanisms. Not different from other PersL materials, Pr3+-activated persistent phosphors exhibit PersL governed by complex trapping–detrapping mechanisms concerning the lattice local structure. However, debates on the specific trapping–detrapping mechanisms for all persistent phosphors have been on since the emergence of the PersL phenomenon.6,15,136–138 Here, we first review the commonly accepted mechanisms of a general PersL phenomenon and then elucidate the unique PersL from Pr3+ based on all previously investigated Pr3+-activated red, IR and UV persistent phosphors.
After absorption of external excitation energy (usually from UV light or high-energy radiation) by host lattices or luminescent centers, electrons or holes (charge carriers) are liberated from luminescent centers and become free to move until captured by recombination centers or by traps. Traps make PersL possible. They are usually derived from impurity centers and crystal defects surrounding luminescent centers, forming discrete energy levels in the band gap or near the band edges, which play pivotal roles in the capturing and releasing of excited charge carriers. The immobilized charge carriers can remain there for an extended period of time depending on the trapping energy levels (i.e., trap depths). Subsequently, the released electrons and holes recombine over luminescent centers, which yields PersL. Therefore, trap depths determine PersL behaviors, especially PersL intensity and decay time. If the trap depth is too shallow, electrons in all traps can easily return to the recombination center yielding a too short afterglow. However, if the trap depth is too deep, electrons are difficult to escape unless via external optical or thermal activation, which also produces a poor afterglow performance. By studying the trap depths, researchers can collect useful information on factors influencing PersL performance. Creation of appropriate trapping centers will be further possible for the design of high-brightness and long-decaying persistent phosphors.
Heating triggers the release of the retained charge carriers from different depths of traps, i.e., the detrapping process. Therefore, trap depth distribution in host matrices is commonly confirmed by thermoluminescence (TL) experiments, with thermally stimulated persistent emission plotted with temperature.19 The relationship between trap depth and TL emission intensity is derived from the equation below.139 It assumes that no retrapping occurs and that only first-order kinetics are considered.139 (1)where I is the TL emission intensity; E is the trap depth; k is Boltzmann's constant; n0 is the number of initially accumulated electrons in the trap; C is a constant; s is a constant related to the atomic frequency factor which varies slowly with temperature; and B is the constant heating rate (K s−1). From the equation, we can directly obtain a clue on complicated correlation between the TL emission intensity with temperature (trap depth) and the local lattice structure.
However, the calculation of trap depth, E, takes much effort due to many involved parameters. Therefore, the initial rise approach is usually used to estimate trap depths.138 It is based on the assumption that on the low-T rising side of the TL curve, the trapped charge carriers are in a constant concentration. Their detrapping percentage is ignorable.
TL provides a qualitative study of the mechanisms responsible for the PersL in the Pr3+-doped persistent phosphors. The peak of the TL (glow) curve versus temperature indicates trap depths. For example, in CaTiO3:Pr3+, the manipulation of charge carrier trapping centers by cationic substitution, synthetic methods, lanthanide co-doping and other strategies is elaborately investigated by TL experiments.56–59,140
3.1 Red/IR PersL
The mechanism of Pr3+ red and IR PersL has been studied similarly since both are ascribed to the emission transitions from Pr3+ 1D2. Essentially, the undesired emission transitions from the Pr3+ 3P0 energy level is completely or largely quenched at room temperature due to a strong coupling with a low-lying charge transfer state (CTS) in transition metal complex compounds with a d0 cation or by a multiphonon relaxation process from 3P0 to 1D2. For example, in titanate perovskites, an IVCT state characterized by (Ti4+–O–Pr3+) → (Ti3+–O–Pr4+) is created, with emissions from Pr3+ 3PJ completely quenched and only emission from Pr3+ 1D2 observed. When a certain number of defects in appropriate trapping depths are surrounding Pr3+ ions in crystalline host lattices, red/IR PersL from the Pr3+ 1D2 state is enabled.
The red PersL from CaTiO3:Pr3+ lasts less than 20 min perceived by naked eyes. Jia et al.56 suggested that two types of electron traps: Pr4+ and oxygen vacancies, contributed to the bright and not very long red afterglow from CaTiO3:Pr3+. The thermal release of electrons stored in these traps and the recombination process with the emitting species were not further discussed though. On the other hand, Boutinaud et al.57 proposed that Pr3+ impurities contribute little to the afterglow process, and the possible formation during the trapping process was self-trapped hole defects and Pr3+/h+ pairs instead. Based on the electron-trapping mechanism, the enhancement of red afterglow can be realized by increasing electron trapping centers via manipulation of sintering conditions and heterovalent substitution of Ti4+ (for example, with Al3+ and Lu3+).60 By substituting Ti4+, red PersL can last longer than 2 h. The charge compensation of Pr3+ at the Ca2+ site by the trivalent ion substituting for Ti4+ around Pr3+ is also likely to increase red emission efficiency.141,142 Other attempts that suitably modify the trapping centers for an enhanced red PersL are, for example, substitution of Ti4+ by other similar transition metal ions (e.g., Zr4+),58 synthesis routes,59,61 or an aspired investigation of (Ca,Sr,Ba)TiO3:Pr3+ solid solutions.57,59
The co-dopant Ln3+ plays an electron trap role in YPO4:Pr3+,Ln3+ (Ln = Nd, Er, Ho, and Dy). The electron trap depths of all studied Ln3+ were indicated by the Ln2+ energy level scheme. As shown in the work, the predicted trap depths (activation energies) are systematically 0.3–0.4 eV shallower than the Ln2+ ground states. Among all co-doping types, Ho3+ co-doping resulted in optimal red PersL of Pr3+ at room temperature (612 nm, > 30 min) by a thermally assisted mechanism and a thermal tunneling recombination. Based on the results, the depth and distribution of electron traps generated by lanthanide co-dopants can be tailored by the choice of lanthanides. Except for the conduction band engineering, hole trap depth can also be tailored via valence band engineering.143
In the MgGeO3:Pr3+ red/NIR/SWIR persistent phosphor, TL measurements were achieved to understand further the origin of the three Pr3+ PersL bands and trap distribution for each emission (Fig. 5c). The three TL curves obtained by monitoring the 625 nm, 900 nm and 1085 nm emissions of Pr3+ ion shared an identical profile showing broad bands from ∼30 °C to ∼300 °C, indicating that these three persistent emissions were ascribed to the same wide trap (oxygen vacancies) depth distribution.
3.2 UV PersL
In principle, UV persistent phosphors need to possess suitable emitters of UV radiation and host materials with large bandgaps for absorbing X-rays or UV radiation, and significantly, charge carrier traps that serve to store excited energy and release it to emitters. For example, Pr3+ in Cs2NaYF6 is a UVC persistent emitter due to its 4f5d → 4f2 emission transition and possible trapping centers (anionic defects) that surrounds Pr3+. By first-principles calculations, fluorine vacancies that were induced by oxygen introduction were acting as electron traps. Fig. 6a illustrates the mechanism of such a UVC persistent phosphor.
Similarly, the highly dense and continuously distributed energy traps in Ca2Al2SiO7:Pr3+ were identified via TL measurements. At room temperature, some deep trapped electrons were still not liberated even after 24 h decay. The design principle here was based on the creation of a small Stokes shift of less than about 3000 cm−1 (0.37 eV) and an appropriate energy location of the first (lowest energy) Pr3+ 4f2 → 4f5d excitation transition, for realizing a highly emissive energy level responsible for UVC emission after UV charging. They were hypothesized to be associated with the compositions and crystal structures of host lattices that accommodate Pr3+. The UVC PersL from Pr3+ was finally realized by doping Pr3+ into highly coordinated host sites with relatively strong crystal field environments in the reported work. Trapping centers for Pr3+ UVC PersL are partially created through charge imbalance from Pr3+ substitution.
As we all know, the energy position of the excited 4f5d state is varied depending on local crystal field, which increases difficulties of achieving a certain emission color from Pr3+ doped materials without enough investigation of a new host lattice structure. Luckily, Pr3+ 4f5d → 4f2 emission transition resembles two other popular lanthanide ions: Ce3+ (5d → 4f)144,145 and Eu2+ (4f65d → 4f7).146 They all belong to 4fn−15d1 → 4fn inter-configurational emission transitions. As Blasse147 found out, the energy level of the lowest 4f2 → 4f5d excitation transition and the Stokes shift of the 4f5d → 4f2 emission in Pr3+ can be predicted from the known data for Ce3+ in the same host lattice. Dorenbos148 further improved the accuracy of the prediction and expanded it to the position of the excited 5d levels for other lanthanide ions. The established prediction models assist the process of finding interesting and appropriate host materials for Pr3+ PersL, especially through 4f5d → 4f2 emission transition.
The dual-band UVC and UVB PersL realized in the Pr3+ doped modified garnet structure shows the hints that cation-size and valence-state mismatch are critical factors for designing UV persistent phosphors.133 The effective trapping centers needed for UV PersL from Pr3+ can be manipulated by cationic substitutions under this principal (for example, Ca2+ → Y3+ and Si4+ → Al3+ in the garnet).
4. Applications of Pr3+-activated persistent phosphors
As intense and long-lasting PersL emission was realized in a wide spectral range from visible to IR, some exciting applications of persistent phosphors have been meanwhile unveiled and progressed in areas such as “glow-in-the-dark” (road-marking and safety) paints and displays,7 excitation-free and autofluorescence-free biomedical applications (drug delivering monitoring, in vivo advanced diagnosis, medical therapies, and minimally invasive surgery)149 and information technological applications.150 For example, in vivo imaging of small animals has been carried out with lanthanide ion-based nanophosphors with IR PersL.17,151 More significantly, as persistent phosphors are mostly rechargeable, photostimulable, and thermostimulable, their PersL capabilities for these applications are under high control and can be revitalized with the introduction of accessible and low-cost optical or thermal stimulation.
4.1 Red/IR PersL
Due to the high penetration power of red/NIR/SWIR/multiband emission and unique features of PersL being free of continuous excitation, red/NIR/SWIR persistent phosphors, with Pr3+ as the luminescent ion, have many potential applications, including night-vision illumination and displays, bioimaging, optical data storage, anticounterfeiting and others.
Similar to other red PersL phosphors,35,36 Pr3+-activated red/NIR/SWIR/multiband persistent phosphors are also suitable for biomarking and in vivo imaging applications. It is mainly due to high tissue penetration of red/IR light with minimum scattering and absorption by tissues considering that animal tissues are transparent at 600–1100 nm.152 Besides, exciting these bio-probes outside the animal body prior to their injection is also free of tissue autofluorescence.
The “glow-in-the dark” property makes visible and IR persistent phosphors ideal display indicators at night and in dark environments for tagging and tracking. With the advent of SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+ as a bright and long-lasting green persistent phosphor, more attention was paid to the development of red/IR persistent tags for night-vision surveillance use. On the other hand, red/IR wavelengths have a better penetration capability in foggy, cloudy and extreme weathers. Pr3+ as a PersL ion always shows multiband PersL, from red to SWIR, due to the emission transition from the same excited energy state (1D2) to the ground states (3H, 3F), showing its high potential in night-vision probing uses. To have the optimal optical imaging results, night-vision imaging devices are usually needed for long-hour observation.12 For example, the red, NIR and SWIR PersL of MgGeO3:Pr3+ persistent phosphor showed appreciable brightness even after a 120 h fading in the dark, thanks to the assisted observation using a night-vision goggle (Fig. 5d).
Persistent phosphors, including red or IR persistent phosphors, usually show unique properties in energy storage under optical stimulation based on the photon trapping and detrapping processes, allowing high-capacity optical information storage.153Fig. 4e presents the photostimulated luminescence (PSL) in Ca4Ti3O10:Pr3+,Y3+79 under stimulation using a 980 nm IR laser with Pr3+ as the emission center. In the process, phosphor was exposed to UV irradiation (write-in) for 5 minutes, held in darkness for 3 hours, and then irradiated by a 980 nm laser (read-out). This proved its rewritable capability as a data storage material. As schematically illustrated in the inset, the corresponding “read-out” process in the deep-trap red PersL phosphor was attributed to the process where the excited electrons were repopulated into the Pr3+ 1D2 level under the stimulation of NIR (980 nm) laser irradiation. This phenomenon was also reported in other persistent phosphors known as “photostimulated PersL”.115,150 Although optical information storage from persistent phosphors has been reported now and then, the lack of deep traps is still a bottleneck of such storage technologies.154
Red/IR/multi-band persistent nanophosphors are ideal optical nanoprobes for excitation-free and autofluorescence-free in vivo biomedical applications, based on their long-lived emission after the removal of external excitation and penetration power in tissues. For bio-imaging, NIR light in the first “biological transparency window” (∼650–950 nm) penetrates deeper into tissues than red light because it is less scattered and absorbed. SWIR light falls in the second “biological window” (∼1000–1400 nm) and tissue penetration depth is even higher. It therefore allows ultra-sensitive and deep-tissue bio-imaging with near-zero autofluorescence background.155
For example, under a night-vision monocular (sensitive to < 1000 nm light), the MgGeO3:Pr3+ phosphor showed very bright emission after 1 h with afterglow observed even after more than 120 h (Fig. 5d inset).12 Therefore, it was applied to a simplified ex vivo bioimaging experiment, with a 4 mm chicken breast as a blocking layer, to evaluate its penetration and persistent tagging performance (Fig. 5d). The intensity ratio of the persistent emissions at 625 nm, 900 nm and 1085 nm change significantly from 1:0.46:0.52 to 1:0.83:1.18 with the addition of a chicken breast. Moreover, the ratio of 900 nm/1085 nm emission intensity changed from 1:1.15 to 1:1.41 (without vs. with chicken breast), which agreed with the predicted penetration power of these three wavelengths in the model tissue (1085 nm > 900 nm > 625 nm).
4.2 UV PersL
The self-luminescing, high-contrast UV PersL from Pr3+-doped UV-emitting phosphors allows unique and wide applications that are not possible for the red/NIR/SWIR persistent phosphors, other than night-vision illumination and optical data storage. For example, UVC PersL was not only observed in a dark room but also detectable in any bright environments via a corona camera due to the absence of “solar-blind UV” in the Earth's atmosphere.
Pr3+ doped UVC persistent phosphors are capable of both daytime and night surveillance as bright and high-contrast persistent tags thanks to the “solar-blind” feature of the UVC radiation and thus strong indication free of light interruption on Earth. The UVC PersL with zero-background uniqueness surprisingly overtakes the conventional PersL tagging status only suitable for dark environments and expands the “glow-in-the-dark” manner of persistent phosphors into bright indoor and outdoor environments enabled by direct sunrays, fluorescent room-lights, or white LEDs. Pan's group40 conducted a series of UVC visualizing experiments from a Pr3+-doped UVC persistent phosphor, Ca2Al2SiO7:Pr3+, in direct sunlight, under room light and in dark environments via a UVC-sensitive corona camera. Fig. 6h displays the imaging results of the Ca2Al2SiO7:Pr3+ phosphor during the decay hours after it was charged by a 254 nm UV lamp for several minutes. UVC persistent emission was superimposed with the colored spots in the images taken by the corona camera. The decaying performance of the Ca2Al2SiO7:Pr3+ phosphor was significantly influenced by ambient lighting conditions (Fig. 6g). In the UVC imaging experiments, the imaging duration in the direct sunlight was about 2 hours, shorter than the reported 12 hours in indirect sunlight or room-light environments as compared.
In addition, UVC PersL shows an excellent germicidal effect on microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.) by causing lethal damage to their DNA or RNA.156 Compared to chemical bactericidal agents, UVC sterilization is noncontact, more environmentally friendly and more effective, especially with UVC radiation at 265–270 nm (germicidal maximum wavelength). For example, Sun et al.41 conducted modulated bactericidal experiments using the UVC persistent phosphor, Cs2NaY0.99F6:Pr3+. Cs2NaY0.99F6:Pr3+ shows an intense and long-lasting (∼2 h) UVC PersL after X-ray radiation (Fig. 6d). To examine the germicidal capability of Cs2NaY0.99F6:Pr3+, five culturing plates with the same number of live Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa PAO1 bacteria were irradiated by the UVC PersL (charged by X-rays) from Cs2NaY0.99F6:Pr3+ for 0 min, 2 min, 5 min, 10 min, and 16 min, respectively. The viability of PAO1 was decreased to ∼40% due to UVC inactivation by the Cs2NaY0.99F6:Pr3+ phosphor. The observation provided a direct clue of effectiveness of UVC persistent phosphors in persistent sterilization. For example, inactivation of viruses,157 can possibly be enabled for a persistent duration by some portable, reusable and low-cost products loaded with UVC persistent phosphors via a proper method without using any complex, chemical-based, less-friendly and expensive apparatus. Besides, applications of UVC persistent phosphors are likely to be scaled up into wider areas such as food industry, medicine processing, and others that need mandatory sterilization in the future. In addition, UVC persistent phosphors hold promises in in vivo bactericidal activities considering that they can be charged by tissue-penetrating X-rays. However, health safety of fluoride-based UVC persistent phosphors and synthetic feasibility of their scale-down nanomaterials are still questionable.
Finally, UVC radiation is capable of photocatalysis via a non-chemical method. The findings for intense and long-lasting UVC PersL from various phosphor materials show possibilities of persistent photocatalytic degradation in solutions. Feng et al. proposed the concept of the “long persistent photocatalysis (LPPC)” effect and the LPPC materials hold promise for photocatalytic applications in the dark.158 However, the feasibility, effectiveness and efficiency of such LPPC materials, including new UVC persistent phosphors, need to be further investigated.
5. Challenges and perspectives
5.1 Remarks on UV/visible/IR Pr3+-activated persistent phosphors
Due to multiple 4f2 and non-4f states of Pr3+, Pr3+ in different host compounds shows completely different PersL emissions, ranging from UVC to SWIR. Their decay time also varies, from a few minutes to hundreds of hours. The two PersL features are first and foremost factors as for real-world applications. Besides, the commonly used charging source is a 254 nm UV lamp and X-ray is second to it.
It is worth noting that the PersL decay time of a persistent phosphor is usually reported regarding a perceivable time of PersL display. However, it is futile to attempt to use it judging Pr3+ PersL performance considering that its observation environments, observation tools and the description of the minimum perceivable PersL are reported differently. For example, the brightness and decay time of Pr3+ red and IR PersL can be drastically varied when observed by dark-adapted human eyes and using a night-vision monocular, respectively.12,110 In other cases, the digital camera, phone rear camera or others can also be used as imaging tools. Besides, different emission energy, different application conditions (e.g., in vivo or ex vivo) only make it impossible to appropriately judge two PersL phosphors. Therefore, a universal testing tool and criteria for a general PersL (not limited to Pr3+ PersL) performance are necessary.1,27
5.2 Remarks on Pr3+-activated PersL mechanisms
Based on known Pr3+ PersL and attempted mechanism discussion on Pr3+ PersL performances from crystal local structures, we can extract a possible principle in designing new persistent phosphors activated by Pr3+ or other luminescent ions to benefit future PersL research.
Due to the existence of Pr3+ 4f2 multiplets and delocalized non-4f states (for example, 4f5d), Pr3+ PersL is manipulated in a very wide spectral range from UVC to SWIR as discussed above. It is approached from two aspects, Pr3+ emission energy level and trapping centers of Pr3+ luminescence, by selection and design of a Pr3+-doped local crystal structure. The former aspect has been already extensively discussed.159 Particularly, the significance of the lowest-energy 5d level relative to 4f2 levels (usually related to Pr3+ 4f5d emission) and of the IVCT state in some Pr3+-doped host materials (usually related to Pr3+ 1D2 emission) needs to be paid much attention, as the most recently reported Pr3+ UV PersL and Pr3+ red/IR PersL have been maneuvered with the two prerequisite conditions, respectively.
The second aspect is closely related to the intrinsic crystal defects and other impurities that contribute PersL in the form of charge carrier traps. It is worth noticing that excellent Pr3+ PersL performance has been usually achieved in Pr3+-doped heterovalent compounds. For example, in alkaline earth metal compounds, Pr3+ is likely to occupy the sites belonging to alkaline earth metal ions (A = Ca2+, Sr2+, Mg2+, etc.);12,40,56–61,77–79,95,97,100 in alkali metal compounds Pr3+ takes sites of alkali metal ions (B = Li+, Na+, Cs+, etc.).40,41,54,67,84,98,131 The charge imbalance caused by Pr3+ heterovalent substitution is believed to provide appropriate electron trapping centers surrounding Pr3+ (PrA˙ or ). Subsequently, hole traps from cationic vacancies such as  and  are created for charge balance. Some also assume that Pr4+ co-exists with Pr3+ in the hosts especially for those phosphors using Pr6O11 as a starting material or synthesized through a long and high-temperature solid-state reaction. Therefore, the corresponding electron traps from  or  also appear. Besides, oxygen vacancy () is always brought up but rarely verified or estimated. Finally, co-doping other lanthanide ions into the Pr3+-activated materials is also used to create more trapping centers.72,79 However, the energy transfer between Pr3+ and the co-doped ion needs to be minimized to observe the highly efficient Pr3+ PersL.
Although the above-mentioned charge carrier traps are usually assumed to account for most PersL (not limited to Pr3+ PersL), we can barely find any direct evidence on it, except for the deficient information of the formed trap depth obtained via TL experiments. In our opinion, it is necessary to first achieve the density and distribution of these defects by several approaches. As we all know, most point defects (dislocation, vacancy defect, interstitial defect, non-stoichiometric defect and impurity defect) are either positive or negative, created intrinsically or introduced by substitution behaviors. Experimentally, the synthesis atmosphere (either air, inert or reducing atmosphere) and the heating duration at the highest temperature likely make a difference in the concentration of positive or negative traps in the host lattice. In addition, the addition of ingredients with strong electronegativity (e.g., F−80) can probably help to verify the accumulation of some positive defects by comparison of the phosphor's PersL to that from the stoichiometric recipe. It is worth noting that sometimes non-stoichiometric introduction can result in an excellent PersL performance.16,77 However, the question is how high a defect level is allowed in a crystal lattice before killer sites dominate or a second phase is generated. At the same time, materials characterization approaches need to be ready for the examination of the positive or negative defects deciding PersL. However, the verification of traps is only the first step; the critical step is to confidently assign the PersL to some specific traps via advanced techniques. Therefore, other than experimental approaches, some computational approach with a certain level of presumption of the crystal structure and prediction can also be beneficial to designing more PersL materials.160 The discrepancies between theory and experiment need to be considered later.
In conclusion, Pr3+ emission transitions (including the inter-configurational 4f5d → 4f2 broadband emission and the intra-configurational 4f2 → 4f2 emissions) and emission colors can be manipulated by selecting appropriate host matrices. Therefore, Pr3+ dopant exhibits versatile steady-state luminescence and PersL in different spectral ranges (UV, visible, IR). Here, we succinctly summarized Pr3+-activated red, IR and UV persistent phosphors based on different types of host matrices and discussed their PersL performance and trapping mechanisms. Other than those general remarks already described in previous subsections, however, new Pr3+-activated red/IR persistent phosphors with higher afterglow brightness and longer afterglow duration still need to be developed regarding their expected real-world applications in night-vision marking, in vivo imaging in large animals or humans and optical data storage in the future. Pr3+ UVC persistent phosphors with UVC PersL lasting for hours show prospective optical tagging abilities in bright and wide fields of view, but the further question is how to convert the potential to real benefits to human beings.
Another possible research direction of interest is Pr3+-activated vis-to-UV upconverted persistent luminescence (UCPL). UCPL is a phenomenon featuring both upconverted luminescence and long persistent luminescence,161i.e., phosphors show a PersL emission with higher photon energy than exciting light. It realizes an effective charging of persistent phosphors using lower photon-energy lights from visible (e.g., white LEDs) or even IR (e.g., 980 nm laser diode). However, vis-to-UV UCPL is very challenging with respect to requirement of multiphoton upconversion (UC) from visible or even IR to UV, not to mention the unpredicted obstacles relevant to creation of effective charge carrier trapping centers. Pr3+ is seen as a candidate UCPL emitter since a relatively short-lived 3PJ intermediate state can possibly contribute to the efficacy of Pr3+ UC (Fig. 7e).162 Two-photon UC process can be realized when two absorption transitions to the Pr3+ 3P0 level are achieved by blue light excitation (Fig. 7d).163 However, the UC efficiency and UCPL likeliness from visible excitation to UV emission remain questioned. For example, in the Gd3Ga5O12:Pr3+ phosphor, although Pr3+ reaches the 4f5d level by subsequently absorbing two 450 nm (laser) excitation photons and the excitation energy is stored by electron trapping centers around the delocalized 4f5d state, as shown in Fig. 7a,102 no UV PersL emission is observed directly from the 4f5d excited state. Instead, the phosphor exhibited visible PersL from 3P1, 3P0 and 1D2 levels of Pr3+ (Fig. 7b) due to the upconverted charging (UCC) by a blue laser diode. The PersL decay at 616 nm (assigned to 3P0 → 3H4) lasts longer than 60 min at room temperature (Fig. 7c). The UCC scheme is further confirmed in the Lu3Al2Ga3O12:Pr3+,Gd3+ phosphor.164 Vis-to-UVB UCPL was observed by multiphoton absorption after cessation of blue-LED illumination, thanks to persistent energy transfer from Pr3+ to Gd3+. The efficiency is still in question. Therefore, as a recently emerging topic related to energy conversion from low photons to high photons, the future of vis-to-UV UCPL studies remains ambiguous.

The underlying mechanisms of Pr3+ red, IR and UV PersL are speculated mainly via TL experiments and trap depth analysis, but strong evidence is still lacking for the formation of trapping centers. We believe, some advanced techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy166 and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy,136 are useful tools to assist in revealing the Pr3+ local structure (for example, possible lattice defects and oxidation states of the emitter ion) and to understand structure–luminescence relationship in Pr3+-activated red, IR and UV persistent phosphors. It also applies to other persistent phosphors. Additionally, innovative design approaches such as machine learning modeling can be utilized to predict or identify new desirable Pr3+-activated persistent phosphors.135
Overall, red, IR and UV persistent phosphors activated by Pr3+ are potential candidates in many applications such as night-vision marks, bio-imaging probes, and optical tagging materials in bright environments. Further efforts can contribute to finding new appropriate host materials for stronger and long-lasting Pr3+ PersL, which also relies on the further explanation of Pr3+ PersL mechanisms assisted by other techniques.
