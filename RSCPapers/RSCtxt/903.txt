Materials characterization revealed the formation of a NiCo2S4–NiCo2O4 composite material. Electrochemical studies, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) cycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), were performed for both the lithium-ion battery (LIB) and supercapattery in the form of a CR-2032 coin cell featuring the NiCo2S4–NiCo2O4 electrode. The lithium storage performance of the NiCo2S4–NiCo2O4 anode in a half-cell exhibited a high reversible capacity of 674 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.2C with high reversibility and excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles at a rate of 1C. The supercapattery device delivered a high specific energy of 86 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 320 W kg−1 with excellent cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency. In both the LIB and supercapattery, using a power law and Dunn's method, deconvolution of the capacitive and the diffusive charge/lithium storage were examined. The high capacitive contribution was attributed to the nanostructured features of the freeze-dried composite material.
1. Introduction
Global population growth and the modernization of industry have led to the extensive use of the non-renewable energy sources, particularly fossil fuels. The extensive use of fossil fuels to obtain energy by means of chemical combustion has resulted in severe environmental issues concerning the air, land and water. Hence, to preserve mother earth, it is necessary to use clean and green energy from renewable energy resources such as solar, wind and tidal energy. However, as these renewable energy sources are intermittent, the energy obtained from these sources must be stored for later use.1 Several energy storage options are available, such as thermal energy storage, mechanical energy storage and electrochemical energy storage. Among them, electrochemical energy storage technology has attractive features, such as portability, durability and efficiency.2 The most common devices based on electrochemical energy storage technology are batteries and supercapacitors. Among the available battery technologies, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are considered to be an advanced battery technology that can meet the energy requirements of consumer electronics including laptops, mobile phones, etc.3 Recently, LIBs have also been considered as power sources for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHECs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs).
However, considering the energy demands on the PHEVs and BEVs as well as grid storage applications, the specific energy and the specific power of the current LIBs must be upgraded to higher performances.4 Hence, it is necessary to replace conventional low-capacity graphite anode with a high-capacity alternate anode material to realize the full potential of LIBs.5,6 In this regard, non-transition metals (Si, Sn and Ge), transition metal oxides (TMOs: NiO, Co3O4, Fe2O3, CoO etc.) and transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs, MX, M = Co, Ni, Fe, Zn, Mo, etc., X = Se, S) are being considered as alternate anodes.7 These alternate anodes undergo either alloying/de-alloying, conversion/re-conversion or a combination of the two when reacted with Li+. Transition metal sulfides, such as CoS, NiS, MnS and MoS2, have been examined as alternate anodes for LIBs.8 For example, Kaifeng et al. prepared a nanocomposite of a cobalt-based bimetal sulfide by means of a hydrothermal–sulfurization–annealing process, which resulted in a reversible capacity of 989 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1.9 Lin et al. synthesized a NiCoS@carbon nanocube composite that displayed a specific capacity of 724 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1.10 Recently, spinel-type metal chalcogenide/oxide composites have attracted great attention due to the possibility of the participation of multiple metal ions in the conversion/re-conversion reactions with Li+. For example, Shipra et al. synthesized a hybrid nanostructured NiCo2O4–NiCo2S4 via a facile ammonia-evaporation synthesis technique, which resulted in a reversible capacity of 777 mA h g−1 at a current density of 2000 mA g−1.11 Subsequent to this, composites of NiCo2S4 (NCS) and NiCo2O4 (NCO) have been synthesized by sol–gel, hydrothermal, and precipitation methods, which require severe conditions, such as high temperature, high pressure, or other specific reagents during the synthesis process. However, the lithium storage mode has not been explored. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the generation of a NiCo2S4–NiCo2O4 composite by means of a freeze-drying (lyophilization) method as an alternate anode for LIBs. Freeze-drying is an effective strategy to remove solvent at a low temperature, resulting in the desired morphology without post-sintering.
In addition to LIBs, supercapacitors have recently attracted significant attention due to their attractive features, such as high power, good cycling stability, etc. There are two types of supercapacitors, viz., electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and faradaic capacitors. The EDLC-type stores charge by means of reversible charge separation at the electrode/electrolyte interface (non-faradaic), while faradaic capacitors store charge through a definite redox reaction occurring on the surface of the electrode. Carbon-based materials such as activated carbon (AC), carbon nanotube (CNTs), carbon nanosheets, graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene-oxide (rGO) are used as electrode materials for the EDLC-type supercapacitors.12 Materials such as conductive polymers, transition metal chalcogenides (TMC), metal oxides and hydroxides have been examined as electrodes for faradaic capacitors. Recently, new devices called “supercapatteries” have been developed as hybrid storage devices. Supercapattery devices combine a battery electrode and a supercapacitor electrode in a single device, which results in high energy, high power, long cycle-life and excellent Coulombic efficiency.13 In terms of electrode materials for supercapatteries, carbon-based materials have been used as the negative electrode and the transition metal oxides (TMOs)/chalcogenides (TMCs) as the positive electrode. Thus, various metal sulfides (e.g., NiS, CoS, SnS2, CuS, etc.) and metal oxides (e.g., NiO, Co3O4, Fe2O3, CoO, etc.) have been explored as faradaic materials for the supercapattery device. Spinel-type metal sulfide/oxide composites have also recently emerged as electrode materials for supercapattery applications, as the heterostructures can provide multi-ion reaction centers that can result in enhanced charge storage. For example, Heng et al. prepared a NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite via a hydrothermal process, which resulted in a specific energy of 35.6 W h kg−1 and specific power of 1.5 kW kg−1.14 Arvind et al. prepared an (rG/NCS/NCO) electrode, which resulted in a specific energy of 32 W h kg−1 and specific power of 375 W kg−1.15 Poompiew et al. synthesized nickel cobalt sulfide nanoparticles (NCS) embedded in graphene via a hydrothermal process, which showed a specific energy of 19.35 W h kg−1 and specific power of 235 W kg−1.16 There are reports dealing with NCS–NCO composites generated by means of different synthetic routes and used as faradaic electrodes for supercapacitors.14,15,17–25 Our group recently reported the supercapattery performances of a spinel-type nanostructured Co3O4 material prepared using a sol–gel method, a nickel/nickel oxide/N-doped carbon (Ni/NiO/NC) nanocomposite prepared via pyrolysis and a nickel/nickel ferrite@carbon (Ni/NiFe2O4/C) nanocomposite through solution combustion.26–28 As spinels are electrochemically active towards lithium-ion storage as well as charge storage, they have been also examined for supercapattery applications, as described here.27,29 In this work, we aim to synthesize a spinel-type metal sulfide/oxide composite in which NiCo2S4–NiCo2O4 grains are anchored on graphene oxide (GO) via a simple freeze-drying method (lyophilization). The advantage of using the heterostructure composite is to have multi-ion reaction centers that can result in enhanced charge storage. Thus, in the present work, we have generated a composite containing NiCo2S4 and NiCo2O4. The detailed electrochemical activity of the lyophilized NiCo2S4–NiCo2O4 composite material towards supercapattery charge storage and lithium-ion storage are reported here. Deconvolution of the capacitive and diffusive charge/lithium storage using a power law and Dunn's method have also been reported in detail.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of graphene oxide (GO)
Preparation of GO was carried out by means of a modified Hummers’ method, as reported elsewhere.30 In a typical synthesis, 1.5 g of graphite powder was added to 70 mL of conc. H2SO4. To this, 5 g of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) was mixed under magnetic stirring at room temperature for several minutes. Then, 5 g of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) was gradually added, which resulted in vigorous heat during the addition. The contents were then kept in an ice bath for 24 h under magnetic stirring. To this mixture, 20 mL of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was added to reduce the residual KMnO4, and stirring was continued for an additional 16 h until the color of the mixture changed to brown. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged, and the obtained suspension was washed several times with distilled water. The obtained powder was air-dried and then ground thoroughly to obtain the GO powder.
2.2. Synthesis of NiCo2S4–NiCo2O4 composite
Initially, the synthesized GO (0.5 g) was dispersed in 50 mL of distilled water and mixed well using a probe sonicator. Then, 10 mmol of nickel(II)acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O), 5 mmol of cobalt(II)acetate tetrahydrate (Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O) and 5 mmol of sodium sulfide (Na2S) were added to the above solution and mixed well using a probe sonicator until a homogenous solution was obtained. After mixing was completed, the contents were subjected to freeze-drying (lyophilization, Penguin classic) to remove the solvent present in the contents, resulting in the generation of the precursor material. The end results of the freeze-drying gave the precursor with certain morphologies. After freeze-drying, the collected precursor material was heated in a tubular furnace at 500 °C for 3 h under an argon atmosphere to obtain the NiCo2S4–NiCo2O4 composite. The different steps adopted in the synthesis of the NiCo2S4–NiCo2O4 composite material are schematically depicted in Fig. 1. The synthesized NiCo2S4–NiCo2O4 composite is hereafter referred to as NCS–NCO.

2.3. Materials characterization
The crystal structure and phase formation of the NCS–NCO sample were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å), Raman spectroscopy (Varian 5000) and Fourier-transform infrared FT-IR spectroscopy (Nicolet 6700). The surface morphology was examined using a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, S-3400 N) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). The composition of the metal ion components was analysed by means of an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, PERKIN ELMER OPTIMA 5300 DV). A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, JEOL JEM 2100 plus) was used to confirm the formation of the composite material. The thermal stability of the material was examined using a thermal analyzer (TA instruments, SDT Q600) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air. The surface area and pore size of the sample were analyzed by means of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using a surface area analyzer (Autosorb iQ).
2.4. Lithium-ion storage characterization
To examine the lithium-ion storage features of the prepared NCS–NCO composite, a CR-2032 coin cell was fabricated using the NCS–NCO as the anode and lithium metal as the counter electrode. The working electrode slurry was prepared by mixing 70 wt% of the active material NCS–NCO, 20 wt% of super P carbon and 10 wt% of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) as a binder using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as the solvent. The obtained slurry was then coated on a copper foil (9 μm thickness) and placed in a vacuum oven that was maintained at 100 °C for 12 h for drying. The active-material-coated Cu foil was cut into a disc (16 mm diameter) using a disc cutter and used as the anode. The mass of the Cu foil before and after coating with the NCS–NCO was measured using an electronic balance (Shimadzu AUW-120D) to obtain the active mass of the electrode. The difference in the mass was taken as the electrode active mass and was found to be 0.91 mg cm−2. From the lithium foil stock, the Li metal was punched into a 15 mm diameter disc and used as the counter electrode. The coin cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox (NICHWELL α-1500u) which was maintained at <1 ppm O2/H2O. The electrolyte used was 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) in a 1:1 volume ratio. A Celgard separator was used. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies on the coin cell were carried out using the electrochemical workstation (Biologics SP150) in the potential range of 0.001–3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Galvanostatic charge–discharge cyclings were performed at various current rates (C-rates) using a battery analyzer (Neware C4008-5 V 50 mA). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on the coin cell before and after conducting the cycle-life tests in the frequency range of 200 kHz–50 mHz using the same electrochemical workstation.
2.5. Supercapattery characterization
The electrochemical activity of the NCS–NCO composite material towards supercapattery was initially examined in a three-electrode cell. The working electrode slurry was prepared as described above. The obtained slurry was then coated onto the nickel foam substrate (1 × 1 cm2) and dried at 100 °C for 12 h. A three-electrode cell was assembled consisting of the NCS–NCO as the working electrode, a platinum counter electrode (1 × 1 cm2) and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The cell was then subjected to electrochemical characterization including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) cycling and electrochemical impedance (EIS) analysis using the same electrochemical workstation. The cyclic voltammograms were recorded in the potential range of 0–0.5 V at different scan rates in 6 M KOH. Two electrode supercapattery devices in the form of a laboratory prototype CR-2032 coin cell were fabricated, which consisted of the NCS–NCO composite as the positive electrode and the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as the negative electrode using glass fiber filter paper as the separator. The active masses of NCS–NCO@GO and rGO were 2.14 and 6.29 mg, respectively. The galvanostatic charge–discharge analyses were carried out at different current densities using the same battery/supercapattery analyzer.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystal structure and morphology
The formation of the NCS, NCO and carbon in the composite material was confirmed using the XRD technique. The obtained XRD pattern of the sample is shown in Fig. 2a. The XRD pattern has a set of diffraction peaks that are indexed to the standard XRD pattern of spinel NiCo2O4 (JCPDS # 73-1702), NiCo2S4 (JCPDS # 43-1477) and carbon (JCPDS # 46-0945). Based on the Bragg peak intensity, the approximate ratio of the NCO, NCS and GO in the composite is 1:2:2. It is seen that the carbon peaks are highly intense, implying that the carbon present is crystalline in nature. It should be noted that the carbon source used in the present work was graphite, which is highly crystalline. It is believed that the combination of freeze-drying and annealing at elevated temperature caused the graphite carbon to retain its crystallinity. Hence, highly intense Bragg peaks were observed for the carbon in the composite sample. To substantiate the XRD results, Raman and FT-IR spectra were recorded. Fig. 2b shows the obtained Raman profile. The Raman profile has only two peaks at 1300 and 1578 cm−1, which were assigned to the D and G bands of the carbon, respectively. It is noted that the ID/IG intensity ratio is greater than 1, which suggests that the carbon present in the sample has associated defects in the carbon layers and the carbon may be in the form of rGO. Further the 2D peak is absent in the NCS–NCO sample. The 2D peak is usually obtained for graphene and few-layer graphene samples. As the GO present is not single-layer or few-layer, the 2D peak is absent. A similar observation has been made elsewhere.31 This conversion of GO to rGO might have occurred due to the probe sonication followed by annealing. The deep scan Raman profile recorded in the range of 100–700 cm−1 is shown in the inset of Fig. 2b. It is seen that the Raman spectrum has peaks at 199, 510 and 659 cm−1, which were assigned to the vibrational modes of NiCo2O4 and NiCo2S4. The peaks at 453 and 630 cm−1 correspond to the Eg and A1g modes of NiCo2S4.32,33 Notably, the peaks of the cubic phase of CoS2 appeared at 290 and 370 cm−1, corresponding to the Eg and Ag modes.34 The FT-IR spectrum recorded for the NCS–NCO sample is shown in Fig. 2c. The two strong peaks observed at 3439 and 1629 cm−1 were assigned to the stretching vibrations of OH and CO bonds, respectively. The band present at 618 cm−1 is ascribed to the tensile vibration of the Ni–S bond, whereas the band seen at 1100 cm−1 is assigned to the tensile vibration of the Co–S bond. Also, the FT-IR peaks at 661 cm−1 and 555 cm−1 were attributed to the M–O (M = Ni or Co) stretching and bending vibrations in NiCo2O4, as represented in the inset of Fig. 2c.35 Thus, the aforementioned XRD, Raman and FT-IR results confirm that the freeze-drying followed by annealing results in NiCo2S4 and NiCo2O4 as the major phases along with defective carbon in the NCS–NCO composite. The following reactions seemed to occur, leading to the formation of the composite material:28 
Ni(CH3COO)2 + 2Co(CH3COO)2 + 4Na2S → NiCo2S4 + 4Na2O + 2CO + 2C + 2(CH3CO)2O↑
(1) 
2(CH3CO)2O → 8C + 6H2O
(2) 
2Ni(CH3COO)2 + 4Co(CH3COO)2 + O2 → 2NiCo2O4 + 18H2O + 24C
(3) 
2Co(CH3COO)2 + 4Na2S + O2 → 2CoS2 + 4Na2O + 2(CH3CO)2O↑
(4)The surface morphology and the composite formation were investigated using SEM and HR-TEM analyses. Fig. 3a–c shows the SEM images of the NCS–NCO composite recorded at different magnifications. It is seen that the surface of the NCS–NCO composite contains multiple shapes of grains and pores. The grains are highly agglomerated with varying shapes and sizes. As seen in the SEM, the matrix is not completely dense, but has pores that can facilitate percolation of the electrolyte and hence can result in ion diffusion. In addition, along with the sulphide and oxide grains, the composite has carbon in it. The purpose of having carbon in the NCS–NCO composite is to bridge the NCS–NCO grains to reduce the diffusion path. Thus, the carbon can aid in electron/ion transport. Fig. 3d shows the EDAX profile and the percentage of each element present in the NCS–NCO composite. The sample consists of 13% C, 57% O, 9% S, 14% Co and 7% Ni. HR-TEM is an apt technique to examine the composite formation. Thus, HR-TEM analysis was carried out. The obtained HR-TEM images are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The presence of the NCS–NCO grains anchored on the carbon matrix is seen. The NCS–NCO grains are in the range of 10–250 nm. Additionally, the lattice fringes collected from the HR-TEM analysis are shown in Fig. 4c and d. The observed lattice fringes were indexed to the planes of NiCo2O4 (JCPDS # 73-1702) and NiCo2S4 (JCPDS # 43-1477). The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in Fig. 4e consists of well-defined rings and spots, confirming the crystalline nature of the sample. The rings and spots were indexed to the Bragg planes of the NiCo2O4 (JCPDS # 73-1702), NiCo2S4 (JCPDS # 43-1477) and carbon (JCPDS # 46-0945). The elemental mappings shown in Fig. 4f–i confirm the homogeneous presence of the elements Ni, Co, S and C in the composite. The HR-TEM analysis substantiated the XRD results discussed above.

To confirm the thermal stability of the NCS–NCO composite and quantify the amount of the carbon in the composite material, TGA/DSC analyses were carried out in the temperature range of 30–900 °C in air. Fig. 5 shows the obtained TGA/DSC profiles. It can be seen that there is a small weight loss in the temperature range of 100–200 °C due to the removal of adsorbed water molecules and other volatile components present in the sample. Further, a weight loss of about 1% is observed in the range 200–400 °C, which was associated with endothermic peak due to the decomposition of sulfur as SO2. The weight loss occurring in the temperature range 600–800 °C is attributed to the thermal decomposition of the carbon in the NCS–NCO composite. As is seen, after 800 °C, no significant weight loss occurred. The endothermic peak at about 830 °C may be related to the decomposition of the spinel material. Thus, the TGA/DSC results confirm that the sample had adsorbed H2O and carbon.36 The estimated amount of carbon was 1.6%. The surface area and pore size distribution of the NCS–NCO composite were analyzed using a BET surface analyzer. Fig. 6 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm recorded for the sample. The BJH pore size distribution is represented in inset of Fig. 6. The isotherm shows type-IV behavior, which is characteristic of a mesoporous material. The appearance of saturation at a high relative pressure (p/p0) implies the absence of macropores. A clear hysteresis loop is seen in the middle portion of the relative pressure (p/p0) range, which is ascribed to the presence of meso-nanopores with slit-type pores.37 The specific surface area of the NCS–NCO composite was found to be 23.719 m2 g−1. The BJH data show that the NCS–NCO composite had pores with a mean pore diameter and total pore volume of 1.6 nm and 0.029 cc g−1, respectively. In addition, BET surface area analysis of the prepared graphene oxide (GO) was carried out, and the specific surface area was found to be 11.11 m2 g−1 as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†).38,39 Further, ICP-OES analysis was carried out to determine the atomic ratio of Ni to Co in the composite material, which was about 1:2, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). This reveals that the ratios of Ni/Co in the composite are consistent with the mole ratio of the Ni(CH3(COO)2·4H2O) and Co(CH3(COO)2·4H2O) in the raw materials.40

3.2. Lithium-ion storage performance of half-cell (NCS–NCO|1 M LiPF6|Li)
The electrochemical activity of the NCS–NCO anode towards lithium-ion storage was investigated. A cyclic voltammetry (CV) study was conducted on the half-cell (NCS–NCO|1 M LiPF6|Li) using a CR-2032 coin cell that consisted of the NCS–NCO as the anode and a Li metal disc as the counter electrode. The CV curves in the potential range of 0.001–3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) recorded at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 are shown in (Fig. 7a). The high-intensity cathodic current peak seen at 0.85 V is due to the decomposition of electrolyte into compounds such as LiF, Li2O, LiCl, and Li2CO3 to form a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI). The formation of the SEI is usually accomplished with high capacity in the initial cycle. Another cathodic current peak observed at about 0.1 V is due to Li+ insertion into the layers of carbon present in the sample.41 In the anodic region, the oxidation peaks observed at 1.6 and 2.1 V are ascribed to the re-conversion to form NiS, CoS, NiO and CoO from the elemental Ni and Co, accompanied by the decomposition of Li2S and Li2O as per reactions (7) and (8). In the second and subsequent cycles, it is seen that the high-intensity cathodic peak that appeared at 0.85 V is significantly reduced and broadened, implying the stabilization of the formed SEI, accompanied with conversion reactions (5) and (6). Notably, it is clearly observed that the CV curves recorded in the second and subsequent cycles are nearly similar and overlapping, revealing stabilization of the conversion/re-conversion reactions of the NCS–NCO anode. The following conversion/re-conversion proceed on the NCS–NCO composite:42–44 
NiCo2S4 + 8Li+ + 8e− → Ni + 2Co + 4Li2S E0: 13 V
(5) 
NiCo2O4 + 8Li+ + 8e− → Ni + 2Co + 4Li2O E0: 0.85 V
(6) 
Ni + Co + 2Li2S → NiS + CoS + 4Li+ + 4e− E0: 2.1 V
(7) 
Ni + Co + 2Li2O → NiO + CoO + 4Li+ + 4e− E0: 2.1 V
(8)Thus, the above CV results imply that the NCS–NCO can undergo the conversion/re-conversion reaction with lithium and can be used as alternate anode for LIBs.42–44 To further quantify the lithium storage features of the NCS–NCO anode, galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves were recorded at different C-rates in the potential range of 0.001–3.0 V. The charge–discharge profiles recorded at 0.2C-rate for the first four cycles of the NCS–NCO anode are shown in Fig. 7b. The initial discharge curve is shown in the inset of Fig. 7b. It is seen that in the initial discharge, the anode exhibits a discharge capacity as high as 1200 mA h g−1. Such high initial discharge capacities are generally reported for the alternate anodes due to the combination of the aforementioned SEI formation and the conversion/reconversion reactions.41 The voltage plateaus seen at 1.5 and 0.85 V in the discharge curve were attributed to the conversion to form elemental Ni and Co from NiCo2S4 and NiCo2O4. The corresponding plateau potentials observed at 1.0 and 2.1 V in the charging profiles are due to the reconversion to form NiS, CoS, NiO and CoO from the elemental Ni and Co, respectively.45 Further, from the GCD profiles shown in Fig. 7b derivative plot (dq/dv) was obtained to confirm the plateau potentials, and is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). It is seen that the peak potentials in the derivative plot nearly match the potentials observed in the CV profiles in Fig. 7a.46 It is noted that the charge–discharge profiles recorded in the second and the subsequent cycles are almost the same, which implies the stabilization of the conversion/reconversion reactions. The charging–discharging plateau potentials observed in the present case are in agreement with the above CV results and literature reports.47 The stabilized reversible capacity exhibited by the NCS–NCO composite anode is as high as 500 mA h g−1. Table 1 shows a comparison of the discharge capacity reported for the NiCo2S4 and NiCo2O4 anodes along with those from the present work. It is seen that present anode exhibits higher reversible capacity compared with the literature values.42,43,48–51

The rate capability of the NCS–NCO composite anode was examined, and the obtained data are shown in Fig. 7c. The discharge capacity of the half-cell consisting of the NCS–NCO anode was 754, 420, 256, 180 and 100 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1C-rates, respectively. The anode exhibits a nearly similar discharge capacity in the examined cycles at each C-rate, which implies high rate capability as well as reversibility of the NCS–NCO anode. When the C-rate was reduced to the initial C-rate (i.e., 0.2C-rate) after examining the half-cell at different C-rates, the half-cell exhibited almost the original discharge capacity, indicating the excellent reversibility of the anode material. The trend of discharge capacity decreasing as the C-rate increases is usually reported for battery-type electrode materials.52 The cycling stability, as well as the coulombic efficiency of the NCS–NCO anode, was examined for 500 cycles at 1C-rate. The obtained cycle-life data are displayed along with the Coulombic efficiency in Fig. 7d. It is seen that the lithium-ion battery containing the NCS–NCO composite electrode showed little fading during the initial cycles and regained almost the original capacity at higher cycles. As shown, the capacity was gradually regained after the 160th cycle and stabilized at about 100 mA h g−1 at even the 500th cycle. The ratio of the discharge capacity to the charging capacity is expressed as Coulombic efficiency and is represented in percentage (%). The Coulombic efficiency of the half-cell was as high as 96% in the 1st cycle and increased to almost 100% at higher cycles, resulting from the continuous activation of the electrode involving pore opening and pore formation during the lithium insertion/deinsertion and conversion/alloying reactions. Additionally, the half-cell was subjected to a cycle-life test at 0.2C-rate to examine its performance at low C-rate. The obtained cycle-life data, along with the coulombic efficiency for 0.2C-rate, are displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI†). It is noted that the half-cell delivers almost the same discharge capacity throughout the examined cycles, even at low C-rate, indicating the suitability of the composite material. Generally, for transition metal sulfide/oxide anodes, limited cycling stability is reported due to structural instability because of the volume change.53 Interestingly, in the present work, the presence of the carbon matrix seems to allow the material to withstand the volume expansion during the conversion/reconversion reactions, resulting in stable cycling stability.
3.3. Capacitive and diffusive lithium storage
A close look at the CV profiles shown in Fig. 7a reveal that there is a huge hysteresis throughout the examined potential range. This implies that there is a capacitive contribution in addition to the diffusive conversion-based reactions mentioned above. Thus, to understand the capacitive and diffusive contributions to the total discharge capacity of the NCS–NCO composite, a detailed cyclic voltammetry study was performed on the coin cell. Thus, the CV curves were recorded at different low scan rates in the range of 0.05–5 mV s−1 in the potential window of 0–3.0 V. The obtained CV profiles are shown in Fig. 8a. The CV profiles have clear current peaks due to the occurrence of the conversion/reconversion reactions as discussed above. Fig. 8b represents the anodic and the cathodic peak currents, which increase with increasing scan rate according to the power law given below:54 
i = avb (or) log(i) = log(a) + blog(ν)
(9)where i is the current response in the CV profile at a particular potential or peak, v is the scan rate (mV s−1) and a and b are constants. The value of b suggests whether the lithium storage is dominated by the diffusion process (b = 0.5) or capacitive process (b = 1).55 The ‘b’ value is the slope of the plot of log(i) vs. log(v) shown in Fig. 8c. The obtained ‘b’ values for the anodic and the cathodic peaks are 0.54 and 0.55, respectively. The b values lie between 0.5 and 1, which clearly indicate that the NCS–NCO anode has a capacitive mode of Li storage in addition to a diffusive mode. Additionally, the percentage capacitive contribution in the discharge capacity was deconvoluted by means of Dunn's method, as discussed below. According to Dunn's equation, the peak current and the scan rates are related as shown below: 
(10)where i is the total current (both diffusive and capacitive) measured at a potential (V) in the CV profile, which is due to the surface capacitive contribution (k1ν) and diffusion-controlled process (k2ν1/2), ν is the scan rate and k1 and k2 are constants.54,56 Dunn's plot can be constructed by plotting (i/ν1/2) vs. (ν1/2), which gives a straight line with the slope k1 and intercept k2. The slope k1 gives the current due to the capacitive storage. Thus, Fig. 8d shows the constructed Dunn's plot for the NCS–NCO anode. From the slope (k1) of the Dunn's plot, the percentages of capacitive and diffusive current were estimated at different scan rates. The obtained data are shown in Fig. 8e. It is noted that as the scan rate increases, the capacitive contribution increases. Specifically, at a relatively low scan rate of 0.05 mV s−1, the capacitive contribution was as low as 4.7%, and the diffusive contribution was as high as 95.3%. At a higher scan rate of 5 mV s−1, the capacitive contribution increased to as high as 47.6% and the diffusive contribution was only 52.4%. A representative deconvoluted CV curve at a scan rate of 3 mV s−1, in which the capacitive and diffusive contributions (in percentage, %) are marked is shown in Fig. 8f. The large area shaded CV profile (green) is the real CV profile that was experimentally recorded. In this CV profile, the deconvoluted capacitive contribution in the CV profile is schematically indicated. This is how the capacitive and the diffusive contributions in the CV profile are given in the current literature.57,58 This high capacitive contribution is attributed to the nanostructured feature associated with the freeze-dried NCS–NCO composite. The presence of the carbon matrix seems to contribute to the capacitive storage. The large surface area of the nanostructured composite material would have also led to more capacitive storage, which led to high C-rate capability, which is desirable feature for a battery-type material. Thus, by applying a suitable synthetic method and selecting the composition of the electrode material, the contribution of the capacitive and diffusive capacity can be tuned to meet the requirements of high C-rate or high capacity.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out to understand the Li+ ion/electron transfer kinetics in the NCS–NCO anode. The EIS measurements were carried out on the CR-2032 coin cell in the frequency range of 200 kHz–50 mHz. Fig. 9 shows the obtained Nyquist plots recorded before and after conducting the cycle-life tests. It is seen that the Nyquist plots consist of a semicircle in the high-frequency region that corresponds to the charge-transfer process and a spike in the low-frequency region that is attributed to the Warburg element for the Li+ diffusion process. The appearance of the spike with a 45° incline relative to the x-axis at the low frequency region confirms that the NCS–NCO anode has significant capacitive lithium storage, substantiating the verification made using Dunn's method as discussed above. The Nyquist plots can be best fit to the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 9. An increased charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 74.58 Ω and shunt resistance (Rs) of 215 Ω were observed for the half-cell after conducting the cycle life test, as shown in Table S2 (ESI†). The increased resistance is attributed to the degradation of the electrode as well as the electrolyte due to extensive cycling, as has been observed before.52

3.4. Electrochemical activity of NCS–NCO in aqueous electrolyte
The electrochemical activity of the NCS–NCO towards supercapattery was initially examined in a three-electrode cell containing 6 M KOH as the electrolyte. Fig. 10a illustrates the cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles recorded in the fixed potential window of 0–0.5 V at different scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50 and 100 mV s−1. A pair of well-defined redox peaks is seen at all the scan rates. A cathodic peak is present at 0.22 V and an anodic peak at 0.35 V, with a peak potential separation of about 130 mV. For an ideal one-electron-transfer reversible reaction, a peak potential separation of 59 mV should be obtained. It is seen that the peak potential separation is larger than 59 mV, which implies that the redox reaction occurring on the electrode is quasi-reversible. As the scan rate is increased, the peak current response also increases, accompanied with increased peak potential separation. The appearance of the clear redox peaks and the scan-rate-dependent current density imply that the freeze-dried NCS–NCO composite electrode is electrochemically active and capable of undergoing defined faradaic reaction in KOH, making it suitable for charge storage. The appearance of the redox peaks is attributed to the following faradaic reactions involving Co2+/Co3+ and Ni2+/Ni3+:59 
NiCo2S4 + 4OH− ↔ NiSOH + CoSOH + 4e−
(11) 
NiCo2O4 + 4OH− ↔ NiOOH + CoOOH + 4e−
(12)The presence of asymmetry in the redox peaks reveals that more than one redox reaction is proceeding on the composite electrode, as both NiCo2S4 and NiCo2O4 are involved in the redox reaction. Fig. 10b shows the Randles–Sevcik plots that were constructed using the anodic and the cathodic peak currents at different scan rates. It is seen that both the current peaks increase linearly with the increase of the square root of the scan rate with the peak current originating almost from zero current at the low scan rate. This linear current increase implies that the aforementioned redox reactions are reversible, which is desirable for a practical charge storage material. To quantify the charge stored in the NCS–NCO composite electrode, the three-electrode cell was subjected to galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) studies in the potential range of 0–0.45 V at different current densities in the range of 0.25–1 A g−1. Fig. 10c shows the obtained GCD curves. The charge–discharge profiles are asymmetric in nature, having a plateau potential at 0.35 V during charging and 0.3 V during discharging. The charge–discharge curves are in accordance with the above-discussed CV curves, confirming the suitability of the NCS–NCO electrode for charge storage. To estimate the charge stored on the electrode, the specific capacity was calculated from the GCD curves using the following equation:27 
(13)where Cs is the specific capacity (C g−1), i is the discharge current (A), t is the discharge time (s) and m is the active mass of the electrode (g). The estimated specific capacities at different current densities are displayed in Fig. 10d. As the current rate increased, the specific capacity decreased, which is usually reported for faradaic-type materials.60 It is seen that the specific capacity of the NCS–NCO electrode is 200 C g−1 at a current density of 0.25 A g−1. Even at a high current density of 1 A g−1, the specific capacity was as high as 150 C g−1. The full utilization of the active material is achieved at low current densities, which leads to high specific capacity, in contrast to the limited utilization of the active material at high scan rate.

To further examine the charge storage features of the NCS–NCO composite, a power law and Dunn's method were used, in which the capacitive and diffusive contributions to the total capacity were deconvoluted, as was done for the lithium-ion storage. Thus, CV curves were recorded for a three-electrode cell at different low scan rates ranging from 1 to 10 mV s−1 in 6 M KOH. The obtained CV profiles are shown in Fig. 11a. The total current response at a specific voltage (or peak) in the CV profile is a combination of both capacitive and diffusive processes as per the power law shown in eqn (9). The anodic and cathodic peak currents increased as the square root of the scan rate increased, as represented in Fig. 11b. Interestingly, more than one redox peak is clearly seen at the low scan rate, confirming the participation of multiple metal ions in the redox. Fig. 11c shows the plot of log(i) vs. log(v) as per the power law in eqn (9). The ‘b’ values estimated from the slope for the anodic and cathodic peaks are 0.875 and 0.81, respectively. Here, the values of ‘b’ lie between 0.5 and 1, which clearly indicates that the NCS–NCO composite has both capacitive and diffusive modes of charge storage, as was observed for the Li storage. Deconvolution of the capacitive and diffusive charge storage was further conducted using Dunn's method. Thus, Fig. 11d shows the Dunn's plots, which are plots of (i/ν1/2) vs. (ν1/2) that give a straight line with the slope k1 and intercept k2. The slope k1 gives the current due to capacitive storage. From the slope (k1) of the Dunn's plot, the percentages of the capacitive and the diffusive current contributions were estimated as done before for the LIB anode. The obtained data are shown in Fig. 11e. It is noted that as the scan rate increases, the capacitive contribution increases.

(f) Representative CV profile at a scan rate of 7 mV s−1 marked with the capacitive and diffusive contributions recorded for the NiCo2S4–NiCo2O4 electrode in 6 M KOH. 
Specifically, at a low scan rate of 1 mV s−1, the capacitive contribution was as high as 47.8%, and the diffusive contribution was as low as 52.2%. At a relatively higher scan rate of 10 mV s−1, the capacitive contribution increased to as high as 71.4%, while the deconvoluted diffusive contribution was only 28.6%. The deconvoluted CV curve with marked capacitive and diffusive contributions (in percentage, %) at a scan rate of 7 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 11f. Therefore, the NCS–NCO composite stores charge by means of the capacitive mode to the maximum extent rather than the diffusive mode.
3.5. Performances of prototype supercapattery (NCS–NCO|KOH|rGO)
The three-electrode data discussed above confirmed that the NCS–NCO electrode is electrochemically active and can be used as a charge-storage material for supercapattery applications. Supercapatteries are hybrid devices that integrate the charge storage behavior of both a battery and a capacitor electrode in a single device. Hence, a supercapattery in the form of a laboratory prototype CR-2032 coin cell was fabricated using the NCS–NCO as the positive electrode and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as the negative electrode in 6 M KOH electrolyte with a glass fiber separator. To balance the charge of both the electrodes on the supercapattery device, the mass of the positive electrode and that of the negative electrode were balanced using the formula given below:27 
(14)where m+ and m− are the mass loadings, C+ and C− are the specific capacity and V+ and V− are the corresponding potential windows of the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. To optimize the operating voltage of the supercapattery device, initially, CV curves were recorded at different potential windows at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The obtained CV profiles are shown in Fig. 12a. It is seen that the optimized potential window could be 0–1.6 V. Beyond this potential window, oxygen evolution takes place, which is undesirable for practical use. Hence, the optimized potential window for the supercapattery was fixed at the potential range of 0–1.6 V. Then, the CV curves were recorded in the potential window of 0–1.6 V at different scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50 and 100 mV s−1. The obtained CV curves are shown in Fig. 12b. It is seen that the CV profiles have redox peaks, confirming the dominance of the faradaic contribution towards charge storage. However, the current loop in the potential range of 0–0.4 V is due to the double-layer contribution. The NCS–NCO composite has more faradaic mode of charge storage due to redox reactions involving both NiCo2S4 and NiCo2O4, contributing to the improved charge storage performances. Thus, the device consists of contributions from the faradaic reaction and the double-layer formation. The NCS–NCO contributes the specific capacity by means of the faradaic reactions as shown in reactions (13) and (14) and the rGO by means of double-layer formation. It should be noted that the NCS–NCO composite has inherent capacitive storage due to the presence of GO, as has been verified before. Fig. 12c shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves recorded at different current densities from 0.25 to 0.75 A g−1. Asymmetric charge–discharge profiles are seen, which demonstrate the supercapattery nature. The specific energy and specific power of the device were calculated from the discharge profiles using the following equations:27 
(15) 
(16)where C is the specific capacity (C g−1), t is the discharge time (s), V is the potential window (V), E is the specific energy (W h kg−1) and P is the specific power (W kg−1). Fig. 12d shows the Ragone plot obtained for the aqueous supercapattery device. The supercapattery device exhibits a high specific energy of 86 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 320 W kg−1. Even at a high specific power of 960 W kg−1, the supercapattery exhibits a specific energy of 10.4 W h kg−1. The obtained specific energy is higher than those of many previously reported NiCo2S4- and NiCo2O4-based electrodes as revealed in Fig. 12d. Table 2 shows a comparison of the specific energy and cycle-life reported in the literature for NiCo2S4 and NiCo2O4-based electrodes with those of the present work.14,15,17–25 It is seen that the NiCo2S4- and NiCo2O4-based electrodes exhibited specific energies in the range of 15–60 W h kg−1. Clearly, the specific energy observed in the present work is higher than most of the reported values, which implies that the NCS–NCO composite is a suitable electrode for practical implementation. The stability of the electrode was tested through cycle-life analysis. For this, the fabricated supercapattery device was subjected to 5000 charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1. Fig. 12e shows the obtained cycle-life data. The charge–discharge curves recorded at the first three cycles and last three cycles are compared in the inset of Fig. 12e. It is seen that the supercapattery shows slightly lower Coulombic efficiency (90%) for the initial 150 cycles, which may be attributed to the poor wettability of the electrode with the electrolyte. A clear enhancement in the coulombic efficiency is then observed, which could be ascribed to the activation of the electrode. Repeated cycling of the electrode would have led to pore opening, pore formation and better wettability of the electrode surface with the electrolyte. Hence, after 160 cycles, the coulombic efficiency was high as 99%, which clearly indicates the robust stability of the device, which is suitable for practical application. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows specific capacity vs. cycle number of the supercapattery device recorded at a current density of 2 A g−1. It is obvious that the capacity decreases upon cycling for a supercapattery device. This decrease in the capacity upon cycling is attributed to changes in the electrode morphology, composition, conductivity, etc. The Coulombic efficiency is the ratio of the discharge capacity to the charge capacity. That is, if the amount of charge input during charging is the same as the amount of charge delivered during discharging, the device is achieving 100% Coulombic efficiency, which is desirable for a practical device. Undoubtedly, the Coulombic efficiency obtained for the present device is almost 100%, even at high cycle numbers, which implies the high stability of the composite electrode. Similar charge–discharge profiles are observed in the initial and the last three charge–discharge cycles, revealing the excellent cycling stability of the supercapattery device.

Additionally, practical application of the fabricated supercapattery device was demonstrated by lighting red, blue and green commercial LED bulbs, as shown in Fig. 13a–c. It was found that three proto-type supercapattery devices that were connected in series could power the red LED bulb for more than 1 h on a single charge. Fig. 13c–f shows time lapse digital photographs of the supercapattery device powering the commercial red LED bulb. Thus, the supercapattery device consisting of the NCS–NCO composite can be a potential electrode for supercapattery applications. Such composite electrodes can be generated for other metal oxide/sulfide systems as well.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a spinel-type NiCo2S4–NiCo2O4 composite was synthesized by a simple freeze-drying method. The crystallinity and morphology of the NCS–NCO were confirmed using XRD, Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy. FE-SEM and HR-TEM confirmed that the NiCo2S4–NiCo2O4 grains were anchored on GO layers. The electrochemical performance of the NCS–NCO composite towards lithium storage and supercapattery devices was analyzed. The lithium-ion battery half-cell (NCS–NCO|1 M LiPF6|Li) in the form of a CR-2032 coin cell a exhibited high discharge capacity of about 674 mA h g−1 at 0.2C-rate with excellent cycling stability. The asymmetric supercapattery device, which consisted of NCS–NCO and rGO as electrode materials in the form of a CR-2032-type coin cell, exhibited a high specific energy of 86 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 320 W kg−1 with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency even after 5000 cycles. The deconvoluted capacitive and diffusive lithium/charge storage calculated using a power law and Dunn's method revealed that there is significant capacitive storage. The excellent electrochemical features of the NCS–NCO composite electrode are attributed to the GO matrix and multi-metal ion participation in the redox reaction, which facilitated the effective ion/electron transport.
