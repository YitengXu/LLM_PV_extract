    , Accepted 29th June 2019First published on 2nd July 2019AbstractSpecific targeting capabilities and effective phototherapeutic functions are the key demands for precise cancer phototherapeutic agents. Herein, a bioinspired nanoplatform composed of Cu(II)-chlorophyll–hyaluronic acid nanoparticles (Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs) was developed for targeting cancer and synergistic photodynamic/photothermal therapy. Inspired by the photonic biosystem of the chloroplast, Cu(II) chlorophyll was used as a photosensitive substituent to covalently connect with a hydrophilic HA tail rather than a natural phytol tail, and this conjugate further assembled into a nanoparticle-like morphology under non-covalent interaction. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu(II) chlorophyll has a much smaller energy gap between an excited singlet and excited triplet, and theoretically leads to rapid electron intersystem crossing that would benefit the PDT effect. In addition, a series of experiments have proven that, under 650 nm laser irradiation, the nanoplatform of Cu(II)Chl–HA can produce a high amount of singlet oxygen and exhibit an outstanding photothermal conversion capability. More interestingly, owing to the specific interactions between the HA component and the CD44 receptor on the cell membrane, the HA tails impart Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs an excellent receptor-mediated targeting performance toward CD44-overexpressing cancer cells. Based on these features, the nanoplatform of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs presents active targeting and outstanding dual modality synergistic PDT/PTT performance of cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this work opens up a new strategy to fabricate a bioinspired multifunctional cancer phototherapy nanoplatform.
Introduction
Over the past few decades, multifunctional photonic nanomaterials have aroused much interest in diagnostics, therapeutics, and theranostics.1–7 A long-sought goal among the different efforts is the pursuit of suitable phototherapeutic nanoplatforms that cause irreversible tumour damage through reactive oxygen species (ROS) and heat generation known as photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), respectively.8–11 At present, PDT and PTT nanoplatforms have been massively studied for their photo-transformation mechanisms and in preclinical mammalian investigation.12–15 According to the recent results, it is also found that cancer cells cannot be completely eliminated in malignancies due to the limitations of PDT or PTT alone in malignant cells (e.g., hypoxic environment and thermal resistance of the cells).16,17 To produce better treatment effects, synergistic phototherapy that integrates PDT and PTT has been developed to overcome the limitations of PDT or PTT alone.18,19
To construct these synergistic phototherapy systems, individual integration of PDT and PTT agents into a nanoplatform is usually required.16,20–22 Unfortunately, the focus on the design of good features to obtain excellent combinational cancer phototherapy performances has hindered the clinical potential owing to less consideration of the unknown biological interactions.23 To address this issue, several studies have proposed an alternative approach for achieving a precise combination phototherapy effect via bioinspired systems.24–26 For instance, enlightened by the homing migration of cancer cells, cancer cytomembranes are utilized as nanocarriers to fabricate bioinspired nanosystems for homotypic targeting combinational phototherapy.27–30 Therefore, the arsenal of available bioinspired nanoplatforms urgently needs to be expanded for effectively targeting cancer and combined phototherapy.
Nowadays, chlorophyll and its derivatives are broadly investigated as photosensitisers in a broad range of research fields, especially in biomedical science.31 Recent reports on chlorophyll and its derivative-based nanoplatforms have demonstrated their great potential for combination phototherapy owing to their excellent ROS and heat generation.32–35 Among them, these photo-conversion systems have been fabricated with chlorophyll encapsulated in amphiphilic carriers. However, these carriers only impart the chlorophyll with water solubility which is far from the requirements for precise phototherapy of cancer. Then, how to functionalize chlorophyll with an improved water-solubility for targeted cancer phototherapy still remains an urgent mission. Chloroplast is a natural photonic functional platform that can effectively utilize solar energy to facilitate the growth of plants.36 In the chloroplast, the photosensitive head, Mg coordinated porphyrin ring is covalently linked through the phytol tail, which directly self-assembles into a stabilized light-harvesting platform.37,38 With sufficient consideration of a natural light-harvesting biosystem, the reasonable modification of a chlorophyll-based head and tail may be an alternative approach to obtain a functionalized chlorophyll-based therapeutic for specific photonic treatment.
Herein, we develop a bioinspired nanoplatform of Cu(II) chlorophyll conjugating hyaluronic acid nanoparticles (Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs) for active targeting and combined PDT/PTT of cancer (Scheme 1). Structurally, Cu(II) chlorophyll (Cu(II)Chl) was covalently connected with HA via PEG linkages. The water-soluble HA chain, as the tail of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs further enwraps the lipophilic Cu(II)Chl, forming a nanoparticle-like morphology. In the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs, copper(II) was utilized as a coordinated substituent to replace magnesium(II) in chlorophyll and further decrease the ΔEST value (the energy gap between the excited singlet and excited triplet), which would boost the electron intersystem crossing rate and theoretically lead to higher ROS generation.39–42 Moreover, a series of ROS capturers separately proved that the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs can produce singlet oxygen with a high yield. Meanwhile, the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs exhibited a good photothermal conversion capability due to their strong Q band absorbance at 650 nm. Subsequently, the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs were assessed for their phototherapeutic potential and they produced an excellent combinational phototherapy effect both in vitro and in vivo. More interestingly, the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs exhibit excellent receptor-mediated targeting performance in CD44-overexpressing cancer cells, because of the CD44 ligands of HA.43–45 To the best of our knowledge, no effort has been devoted yet to creating chlorophyll-based targeting phototherapeutic nanoplatforms. Thus, this work provides a bioinspired approach for constructing a covalently bonded photo-conversional therapeutic nanoplatform that exhibits a high amount of singlet oxygen and heat generation for the precise synergistic phototherapy of cancer.

Results and discussion
Characterization of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs
In this work, Cu(II) chlorophyll conjugating hyaluronic acid nanoparticles (Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs) were successfully prepared via two facile steps (Scheme 1a and Fig. 1a), which include the synthesis of anomeric PEG-modified Cu(II)-chlorophyll (PEG–Cu(II)Chl) and the fabrication of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs. In the first step, PEG-diamine was chemically bonded to the activated carboxyl group of Cu(II)Chl to synthesize anomeric PEG–Cu(II)Chl. Afterwards, in the 1H NMR spectra, PEG–Cu(II)Chl (Fig. 1b, and S1†) exhibits the coexistence of PEG methylene protons, with characteristic signals at 0.9–1.1 ppm, and unique peaks of the protons of sodium Cu(II) chlorophyll (Cu(II)Chl), at 2.1 ppm, indicating that Cu(II)Chl has successfully been bound to PEG-diamine under the activation of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyllaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and 1-hydroxy-2,5-pyrrolidinedione (NHS). Afterwards, based on the anomeric amino groups in the PEG–Cu(II)Chl skeleton, covalent linkages between the carboxylic groups of HA and the amino groups of PEG–Cu(II)Chl were formed (Cu(II)Chl–HA). In the 1H NMR spectrum of Cu(II)Chl–HA (Fig. 1b, and S1†), chemical shifts at 4.3–4.5 ppm, belonging to the hemiacetal proton of the HA chain, and signals at 0.9–1.1 ppm, assigned to the methyl proton of the PEG–Cu(II)Chl fragment, were observed, indicating that a covalent bond between Cu(II)Chl and HA had been formed.

Additionally, the as-prepared Cu(II)Chl–HA conjugate was further studied by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 1c, all the characteristic peaks were observed within the broad range of 4000–500 cm−1. The peak at 1684 cm−1 of Cu(II)Chl originates from the CO stretching vibration of COO−, whereas the peak of the CO stretching vibration in Cu(II)Chl–HA had shifted to 1660 cm−1, demonstrating an amide condensation reaction occurring in PEG–Cu(II)Chl. By comparison of Cu(II)Chl, PEG–Cu(II)Chl, and Cu(II)Chl–HA, the peaks at 1550–1565 cm−1 were attributed to the stretching vibration of the secondary amine in the aromatic porphyrin. Owing to the C–O–C stretching vibration, the peaks at 1041–1047 cm−1 emerged in both HA and Cu(II)Chl–HA. Therefore, the results of both the 1H NMR and FTIR spectra confirm that the chemical bonds of Cu(II)Chl–HA have been formed.
Moreover, the UV-vis-NIR spectrum (Fig. 1d) of Cu(II)Chl–HA exhibits almost the same characteristic absorbance of Cu(II)Chl, indicating that the Cu(II)Chl–HA fragment shows dominant absorbance in Cu(II)Chl–HA. To compare with the spectrum absorption of Cu(II)Chl, the Soret bands (the absorption band in the range of 300 nm–500 nm) and Q bands (the absorption band in the range of 600 nm–700 nm) of PEG–Cu(II)Chl and Cu(II)Chl–HA were gradually red-shifted, these phenomena are on account of the covalent modification of Cu(II)Chl. The role of PEG or HA in the mechanism of red-shifted absorption contributes to their giant chemical structures that push the electrons in the porphyrin ring and decrease the energy gap between the LUMO and HOMO orbitals, leading to obvious absorption enhancement in the NIR region.3 Hence, the spectral phenomena not only indirectly reveal the successful connection between the Cu(II)Chl head and HA tail, but also indicate their potential as one kind of phototherapeutic agent owing to their Q band absorbance. Additionally, the strong absorptions of Cu(II)Chl were both dominant components in Cu(II)Chl, PEG–Cu(II)Chl, and Cu(II)Chl–HA in the conjugation reaction. The conjugation efficiencies of 84% and 74% were achieved for Cu(II)Chl with PEG–Cu(II)Chl and Cu(II)Chl–HA (Fig. S2†), and the quantified proportion of Cu(II)Chl in Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs is of 14.37% (Fig. S3†).
To realize the topological morphology of Cu(II)Chl–HA dispersed in water, the morphology and hydrodynamic size distribution of Cu(II)Chl–HA were measured via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic laser scattering (DLS). As shown in Fig. 1e and Fig. S4,† Cu(II)Chl–HA displays a particle-like morphology with a diameter range of 20 to 120 nm. In the DLS (distributed by density) results, an average hydrodynamic diameter of 104 nm was observed for the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs (Fig. S5†), which is in accordance with the TEM results. These investigations reveal that Cu(II)Chl–HA has already assembled into a nanoparticle-like morphology with a symmetrical distribution under non-covalent interaction, as well as the previous reported investigations.46–48 Moreover, no obvious differences were observed in digital images (Fig. S6†) after 7 days of Cu(II)Chl–HA NP dispersion in water, saline, PBS, DMEM, and DMEM + serum. Both the absorption spectra (Fig. S7†) and the average hydrodynamic sizes (Fig. S8†) exhibit negligible variations, which illustrate a well stable performance of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs. Hence, the as-prepared Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs present excellent potential for dispersion-stable receptor-mediated endocytosis.
Photothermal and photodynamic properties
From the absorption spectrum (Fig. 1d), Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs, comprising Cu(II)Chl fragments, exhibit a minor absorption peak near 650 nm, which suggests that Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs may have good photothermal and photodynamic conversion potential. To investigate the photothermal performance, the temperature increase due to Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs was recorded under continuous irradiation from a 650 nm laser (1.0 W cm−2) for 10 min. From the digital IR thermograph and corresponding photothermal curves, the temperature of a Cu(II)Chl–HA NP (100 μg mL−1) solution increased from 22 to 53 °C over 10 min (Fig. 2b and c). In comparison, pure water and solutions of HA and PEG-diamine exhibited negligible temperature increases under 650 nm laser irradiation, indicating that the remarkable photothermal conversion of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs originates from the Cu(II)Chl fragments. These observations demonstrate that Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs are capable of efficiently generating thermal energy from optical energy. In addition, the Cu(II)Chl–HA NP solution reached nearly identical temperatures for each of the five heating cycles of the photothermal conversion test, which reveals that Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs exhibit remarkable photostability (Fig. 2d). In general, these results demonstrate that Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs are photostable and amenable for potential PTT applications.

Even though previous studies demonstrated that chlorophyll can effectively generate ROS as a promising candidate PDT, these studies did not prove that Cu(II) chlorophyll can effectively generate ROS as well. To better understand the ROS generation of photo-induced Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs, the theoretical excited orbitals of the photosensitive core Cu(II)Chl were calculated based on time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) performed at the B 3LYP/6-31g level.39,40 With the comparison of chlorophyll and pheophytin, the calculations on Cu(II)Chl revealed that the HOMO and LUMO distributions are obviously separated (Fig. S9†). More interestingly, the results of the Cu(II)Chl (Table S1†) clearly exhibit a much smaller ΔEST value, showing that the energy gap between the lowest singlet excited state and the lowest triplet excited state is due to the separation of the frontier orbitals. Accordingly, these calculated phenomena indicate a potentially high electron intersystem conversion (ISC) rate of Cu(II)Chl between the lowest singlet excited state and the lowest triplet excited state, so that the fast crossing electrons in the lowest triplet excited state lead to a possibility of enhanced ROS generation under photoexcitation.41,42 Thus, the TD-DFT calculations persuade that the Cu(II)Chl can theoretically serve as a candidate to substitute natural chlorophyll for high performance photo-induced ROS generation.
In addition, a series of investigations on the generation of ROS were carried out as follows. To assess the photo-induced ROS generation of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs, the 1,3-diphenylbenzofuran (DPBF) chemical trapping method was utilized. Previous studies have demonstrated that ROS (e.g., 1O2 and O2˙−) are capable of oxidizing DPBF to produce its oxidized state, eliminating its spectral absorption.49–51 Because Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs exhibit good absorption at 650 nm, an aqueous solution of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs was exposed to 650 nm laser illumination to stimulate the photo-induced generation of ROS. In the presence of Cu(II)Chl–HA (Fig. 2e), the absorption at 420 nm significantly decreases by 85% after irradiation for 1 min. For comparison, the absorption spectrum was recorded for a nonirradiated solution of DPBF and Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs. A negligible change was observed in the absorption spectrum of the unilluminated mixture of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs and DPBF (Fig. S10†). These results indicate that the primary cause of ROS generation is photo-illumination, which originates from the spectral absorption of the Cu(II)Chl fragment.
To further determine the nature of the ROS produced by Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperide (TEMP) were implemented as specific ROS spin-trap reagents in electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy.52 No ESR signal emerged in the presence of DMPO (Fig. 3a), whereas the signals of the TEMP adduct were found in both Cu(II)Chl and Cu(II)Chl–HA NP solutions (Fig. 3b). These phenomena reveal the as-produced ROS in the aqueous suspension is 1O2 rather than ˙OH and O2˙− under 650 nm laser illumination. In addition, commercial 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and new methylene blue (NMB) were simultaneously employed as a promising method to quantify the 1O2 generation of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs (ΦCu(II)Chl–HA).53,54 Afterwards, the 1O2 quantum yield of NMB (ΦNMB) was measured under 650 nm laser irradiation. The absorption spectra of NMB and DAB are shown in Fig. S11.† The spectral absorption of DAB below 550 nm is clearly enhanced by the oxidized product of DAB, which is induced by the 1O2 generation of NMB. At the same time, Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs were evaluated by measuring the oxidation of DAB by 1O2 generated under the same conditions. Following a previous report, QCu(II)Chl–HA/QNMB was calculated with a result of 0.881. This indicates a significantly high 1O2 generation yield for Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs, approximately equal to that of NMB. As expected, Cu(II)Chl–HA can serve as an excellent photoinduced 1O2 generator, and it is an outstanding candidate for PDT.

Furthermore, photoinduced intracellular 1O2 production is an essential component of effective photodynamic therapy. To characterize intracellular 1O2 generation, 4T1 cells were treated with Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs at different dose rates and then stained with DCFH-DA, which is an intracellular 1O2-capturing fluorescent dye. From Fig. 3c, it can be seen that green intracellular fluorescence existed in 4T1 cells treated with Cu(II)Chl–HA and 650 nm laser illumination. However, green intracellular fluorescence is nearly non-existent in 4T1 cells that are only treated with PBS or Cu(II)Chl–HA. Hence, the potential of Cu(II)Chl–HA to be used as a new photoinduced intracellular 1O2 generator is demonstrated.
Receptor-mediated targeted cell-killing efficacy in vitro
Owing to their significant photoinduced heating and 1O2 generation, the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs may have great potential for combined PTT/PDT. To evaluate the cell-killing efficacy, concentration-dependent cell viabilities under various treatment conditions were investigated in three different cell models: normal mouse fibroblast (L929) cells with low CD44 expression, mouse triple-negative breast cancer (4T1) cells and human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells with high CD44 expression.55–57 To measure cell viability, a standard MTT assay was used as a reliable method to assess the cytotoxicity of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs. Briefly, Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs were used to treat L929, 4T1 and HeLa cells at concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 μg mL−1, and then the cells were incubated for 24 h. Subsequently, cell viability was assessed by the standard MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 4a, there were no viability changes after 24 h of treatment with Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs. Because the cell viabilities of all the cell lines were >90%, the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs were negligibly cytotoxic in vitro. Therefore, Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs meet the requirement of low-cytotoxicity of the phototherapeutics when not exposed to irradiation.

Phototherapeutic performances of single PTT, individual PDT, and their combined treatments on 4T1 (c) and HeLa (d) cells, p-value: *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01. Cells were incubated with different concentrations of Cu(II)Chl–HA. Each of the above samples was irradiated with a 650 nm laser at a power density of 1.0 W cm−2 for 5 minutes. 
The laser-irradiated cell-killing efficacy of the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs was measured by in vitro cell viability assays. In detail, the L929, 4T1, and HeLa cells were cultured with different concentrations of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs for 24 h. Then, the cells were exposed to 650 nm laser irradiation for 5 min. After this treatment, the cell viability was measured via the standard MTT assay. As can be seen in Fig. 4b, the treatment of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs and laser illumination did not impact the viability of the L929 cells, indicating the good cytocompatibility of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs. However, the viability of the 4T1 and HeLa cells exhibited a concentration-dependent reduction. As the concentration of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs increased from 10 to 100 μg mL−1, the photoinduced cell viability notably decreased from 86% to 12% (Fig. 4b), demonstrating the concentration-dependent cell-killing efficacy. These results indicate that Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs exhibited selective photoinduced cytotoxicity toward 4T1 and HeLa cells and good cytocompatibility toward L929 cells after 650 nm laser irradiation. These findings indicate that the targeted phototherapeutic effect may be attributed to the CD44 overexpression on the surface of the 4T1 and HeLa cancer cells, which is similar to that of other HA-receptor-targeted systems.45,55–57 The targeting specificity of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs was determined to realize receptor-mediated targeting nanoparticle internalization by ICP-OES. The three cell models (L929, 4T1, and HeLa cells) were incubated with equal concentrations (200 μg mL−1) of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs for different time gradients. Then we processed the collected cells and tested the contents in the intracellular fluid (Fig. S12†). For the cancer cells with CD44 receptors over-expressed on the cellular membrane, the Cu content in the intracellular fluid is significantly higher than that in normal cells. This fact demonstrates that Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs were fed into the cells by targeting selection. Another test is to further illustrate that Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs target the cancer cells with the help of the HA unit. In the three cell models, it can be seen that the concentration of copper ions in the intracellular fluid without adding HA is significantly higher than that in the cells added with HA in advance, indicating that Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs could target CD44-overexpressing cancer cells.
It should be noted that the above-mentioned excellent photo-induced cytotoxicity effect is not only attributed to the photothermal effect of the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs but also attributed to the photoinduced ROS production of the NPs. To further verify the photothermal therapeutic effects, 4T1 and HeLa cells were irradiated in the presence of vitamin C for 5 min because vitamin C can serve as an eliminator of ROS.58 In addition, the contribution of the photodynamic effect was also assessed by keeping the cells in an ice bath during the 5 min 650 nm laser irradiation (1.0 W cm−2).45 From the results of the 4T1 (Fig. 4c) and HeLa (Fig. 4d) cells, the concentration-dependent viabilities after a single PDT treatment were relatively higher than those of a single PTT treatment, suggesting that the observed combined photo-induced therapeutic effect is a PDT-dominated combined PTT/PDT effect. Additionally, owing to the different uniqueness of diversified phototherapeutics, light power density is a critical factor that affects their photodynamic efficacy. Compared with several other studies (Table S2†), a power density of 1.0 W cm−2 is an appreciable value for cancer phototherapeutics.59–64
To visualize the combined phototreatments of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs, calcein-AM and propidium iodide (PI) were applied as fluorescence markers to strain living cells (green) and dead cells (red), respectively, for observation by fluorescence microscopy. In this section, 4T1 cells treated with Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs were stained with calcein-AM and PI prior to laser irradiation. Initially, green fluorescence (calcein-AM) was observed in the presence of PBS and Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs, and no red fluorescence (PI) was observed (Fig. 5), demonstrating that Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs had no appreciable cytotoxicity, similar to PBS. In contrast, distinct red fluorescence (PI) was observed in the 4T1 cells that were incubated with Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs after 5 min of 650 nm laser irradiation. Hence, Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs exhibit great potential for biocompatible photoinduced anticancer treatment in vitro.

The images were taken before and after 650 nm laser irradiation at a power density of 1.0 W cm−2 for 10 min. Scale bar: 100 μm. 
Combined PTT/PDT treatment in vivo
Following the outstanding phototherapeutic performance of the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs, in vitro studies to determine their tumour efficacy were conducted. For these studies, female Balb/c nude mice bearing 4T1 tumours were selected as the animal model for phototherapeutic evaluation. Before assessing the phototherapy, it is important to verify the biological metabolism (e.g., biodistribution and bioclearance) of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs. Enlightened by the element composition of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs, Cu, a transition element acts as a good tracking marker for distribution in biological systems.65 As a priority, the quantified proportion of Cu contents in Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs had been tested with a value of 2.55% by ICP-OES (Fig. S13†). Sequentially, the biodistribution of Cu contents has been evaluated, and the results in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney were completely different (Fig. 6a). The Cu contents in the liver and kidney are significantly higher than those in the other major organs, and the Cu contents gradually decrease with prolonged time periods. In addition, Cu accumulation increased for 12 h post-injection and then decreased to normal levels over a prolonged time period, whereas Cu did not exhibit the same accumulation peak in the kidney samples. These phenomena indicate that Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs are gradually metabolized over a prolonged post-treatment period. In addition, the time-dependent Cu contents gradually decreased in the blood samples, suggesting excellent blood clearance of the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs. Interestingly, the contents of Cu in harvested tumours gradually increased to a maximum at 24 h. These results are nearly identical to those of other nano-integrated platforms of HA, and it suggests that the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs are capable of CD44 receptor-mediated targeted accumulation.

(b) Relative volume change curves after different treatments of 4T1 tumour-bearing mice, p-value: ***, p < 0.001. (c) Digital photographs before and after treatment for 14 days, insert: corresponding histological H&E staining assay of the harvested 4T1 tumours, scale bar: 100 μm. 
Considering the Cu accumulation trend shown in Fig. 6a, the optimal time for accurate phototherapy is 24 h after the intravenous injection. After 24 h, in vivo combined PTT/PDT of 4T1 tumour-bearing nude mice was conducted under 650 nm laser irradiation (1.0 W cm−2) for 5 min, and the temperature was recorded via IR thermal imaging equipment at the same time. From the digital thermal photographs (Fig. S14†), we can see that the temperature of the solid tumours with intravenous injections of the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs were significantly increased to almost 53 °C after 5 min of irradiation, and this high temperature indicates that Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs could effectively thermally treat the cancer cells. The control mice, injected with saline, exhibited a negligible temperature change in the solid 4T1 tumours. Thus, these results demonstrate that the presence of only laser irradiation cannot induce a temperature increase, whereas the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs are the dominant factor to perform photothermal conversion in vivo.
To further evaluate the combined photoinduced anticancer performance, Balb/c nude mice bearing 4T1 tumours were randomly separated into four different treatment groups to investigate the anticancer effects of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs in vivo. In the experimental group (Cu(II)Chl–HA + laser), mice were intravenously injected through the tail vein with a saline dispersion of the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs, which circulated for 24 h, and then irradiated with a 650 nm laser (1.0 W cm−2) at the tumour site for 5 min. Additionally, mice that received a saline injection (laser only) and those that were not exposed to 650 nm laser irradiation (Cu(II)Chl–HA only) served as the control groups; untreated mice that received saline without laser irradiation were the blank group (saline). After these treatments, tumour sizes and body weights of the mice were recorded for two weeks. The relative volumes of the tumours gradually shrank over time in the test group (Cu(II)Chl–HA + laser) (Fig. 6b), whereas the relative volumes in the other three groups grew rapidly during the 14 days post-treatment. The same visual results in the digital photographs of the mice correspond to the volume-shrinking measurements (Fig. 6b and c). After a 14-day experimental period, the mice were sacrificed, and their tumours were harvested for histological examination using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The digital photographs of the harvested tumours (Fig. S15†) showed that the representative tumours of the Cu(II)Chl–HA + laser group were directly inhibited compared with those of the other three groups, indicating that Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs have great photoinduced tumour inhibition capabilities.
In addition, histological examination of the harvested tumours (insert in Fig. 6c) reveals that the tissue morphology of tumours in the Cu(II)Chl–HA + laser group was completely different from those of the other three groups. Compared to the tissues of the control and blank groups, a much less dense tissue spacing and a lower number of cells were observed in the tissue morphology of the test group. These histomorphological evidence demonstrates that significant photoinduced treatment of the solid tumour occurred when treated with Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs and irradiation. In general, the results indicate that the NIR laser-excited Cu(II)Chl–HA is a feasible option and is highly effective for combined PTT/PDT of cancer both in vitro and in vivo.
Moreover, body weight fluctuations and H&E assays of the major organs were also performed, which were treated as additional indicators for estimating the in vivo compatibility. These results showed that there were no significant weight fluctuations, which implies that there were no obvious toxic effects during the 14-day treatments (Fig. S16†). In addition, no obvious histological changes were observed in the major organs of the mice groups injected with Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs (Fig. S17†). Therefore, this work represents a typical example of a biocompatible nanoplatform for precise PTT/PDT combined phototherapy of malignancies.
Conclusions
In summary, chlorophyll-inspired Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs were successfully prepared for targeting cancer and combined phototherapy. Inspired by the natural composition of chlorophyll, Cu(II)Chl was covalently connected to a mimicking tail which is HA via PEG linkages, and further self-assembled into a likely receptor-mediated targeting morphology. The copper-coordinated sites can decrease the energy gap between the excited singlet and excited triplet, theoretically suggesting a higher amount of singlet oxygen generation. It is demonstrated that Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs not only produced a high yield of 1O2 but also released a substantial amount of heat, under 650 nm irradiation. This bio-inspired nanoplatform demonstrated an excellent dual-modality photodynamic and photothermal effect toward CD44-positive cancer both in vitro and in vivo.
More widely, this study opens up a new strategy to build a bio-inspired multifunctional nanoplatform of cancer phototherapy. The uniqueness of the metal-coordination center in chloroplast-inspired Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs is of great significance to extend its practical applications as a precise effective phototherapeutic agent, which is rarely explored. In addition, Cu(II) chlorophyll with hyaluronic acid contributes to biocompatibility, active targeting and dual-modality phototherapy efficacy. Therefore, this study can not only pave the way for the utilization of a novel nanoplatform as a multifunctional cancer phototherapeutic, but can also provide new insight into the application of a bio-inspired methodology in precise biomedical science.

O,O′-Bis(2-aminopropyl) polypropylene glycol-block-polyethylene glycol-block-polypropylene glycol (PEG-diamine, Mr: 600) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company (USA). HA (10 kDa) was purchased from Freda Company (Fujian, China). Foetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from HyClone Company (USA). DMEM (high glucose) and normal RPMI-1640 culture medium were obtained from Gibco Company (USA). Penicillin–streptomycin, VC, MTT, and PBS were obtained from Sigma Company (USA). Propidium iodide (PI) and Calcein-AM were obtained from Invitrogen (Shanghai, China). L929, 4T1, and HeLa cells were supplied from Immunetech International (Guilin, China). Dialysis bags with 1000 and 3500 Da molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Beijing, China). All solvents and reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Water was purified with a Milli-Q apparatus (Bedford, America).
Preparation of PEG–Cu(II)Chl
First, 0.368 g of Cu(II)Chl was well dispersed in 100 mL of DMSO. Subsequently, 0.955 g of EDC·HCl and 0.575 g of NHS were added into the gently stirring solution to activate the COO− groups of Cu(II)Chl at room temperature. Four hours later, 2 mL of PEG-diamine was dropwise added into the mixture and continuously stirred for another 24 h. Then, the previous solution was evaporated under vacuum to remove DMSO. After that, the resulting solution was washed and dialyzed against an excess of deionized water for 3 days through a 1000 Da MWCO dialysis bag. Finally, PEG–Cu(II)Chl was obtained after freeze-drying.
The PEGylation efficiency of Cu(II)Chl into PEG–Cu(II)Chl was calculated by comparing the absorbance of the reactant (sodium Cu(II)Chl) and product (PEG–Cu(II)Chl) in the corresponding dilute aqueous solution. In more detail, the reactant (0.368 g of Cu(II)Chl) and total freeze-dried product (PEG–Cu(II)Chl) were both diluted in the corresponding aqueous solution within 12 mL of water, and then the as-prepared aqueous solution was diluted to approximately 400×, 800×, 1600×, and 3200×. The relative contents of the reactant and product in the 400×, 800×, 1600×, and 3200× dilutions were assumed to be 1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125, respectively. Sequentially, the absorbance of the above samples was recorded at 630 nm wavelength. Finally, the PEGylation efficiency was calculated based on the ratio between the slope of PEG–Cu(II)Chl and the slope of Cu(II)Chl.
Fabrication of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs
Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs were synthesized by coupling the as-prepared PEG–Cu(II)Chl to an activated HA chain. Briefly, 0.466 g of HA was dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water. Then, it was activated with 0.0575 g of EDC and 0.0345 g of NHS at room temperature for 4 h. Then, 0.4 g of PEG–Cu(II)Chl was added and stirred for another 24 h. To purify the resulting solution, it was dialyzed against an excess of deionized water for 4 d with a 3500 Da MWCO dialysis bag. After freeze-drying, purified Cu(II)Chl–HA was obtained. When the freeze-dried Cu(II)Chl–HA was dispersed in deionized water, the Cu(II)Chl–HA automatically formed the nanoparticle morphology.
The conjugation efficiency of PEG–Cu(II)Chl with Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs was calculated by following the same method discussed in the section of preparation of PEG–Cu(II)Chl. PEG–Cu(II)Chl (0.4 g) and their total freeze-dried products (Cu(II)Chl–HA) were both diluted in the corresponding aqueous solutions within 16 mL of water, and then the as-prepared aqueous solution was diluted to approximately 100×, 200×, 400×, and 800×. The relative contents of the reactant and product in the 100×, 200×, 400×, and 800× dilution were assumed to be 1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125, respectively. The absorbance of the above samples was recorded at 630 nm wavelength. Afterwards, the conjugation efficiency of PEG–Cu(II)Chl with Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs was calculated based on the ratio between the slope Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs and the slope of PEG–Cu(II)Chl. Finally, the conjugation efficiency of Cu(II)Chl with Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs was calculated by multiplying the value between the PEGylation efficiency of Cu(II)Chl into PEG–Cu(II)Chl and the conjugation efficiency of PEG–Cu(II)Chl with Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs.
Quantified proportion (Q) of Cu(II)Chl in Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs
To address the quantified proportion, the Cu(II)Chl and the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs were dispersed in aqueous solution with gradient concentrations, and their spectral absorption was further evaluated. At their maximum absorption wavelength, the linear fit plots display a dominate role in spectral absorption, and HA exhibited a negligible absorbance at 630 nm wavelength. Because spectral absorption is positively correlated to the concentration, the quantified proportion of Cu(II)Chl in Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs is related to their absorbance ratio. With this congruent relationship, the quantified proportion (Q) can be calculated using the following equation:Q = SCu(II)Chl–HA/SCu(II)Chlwhere SCu(II)Chl–HA is the linear fitting slope of Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs and SCu(II)Chl is the linear fitting slope of Cu(II)Chl.
Characterization and methods
Theoretical analysis was performed by using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) (Gaussian 09 programme). The chemical structure of the Cu(II)Chl–HA NPs was characterized by using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR, PerkinElmer, USA) and 500 M superconducting nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (Bruker, Germany). The adsorption spectrum was recorded on a UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu, Japan). The morphology was imaged on a transmission electron microscope (TEM, HT7700/HT7700 Exalens, HITACHI, Japan). The hydrodynamic size was determined on a ZS90 nanoparticle & zeta potential analyser (Malvern, U.K.).
Calculation of the excited state characteristics by TD-DFT
The models of individual chlorophyll, pheophytin, and the Cu(II) chlorophyll compound were investigated following the approach reported by Ju and colleagues.39 Cu(II) chlorophyll formed a coordination compound due to the interaction of the internal Cu2+ ion with the sp2-bonded nitrogen of chlorophyll. All the results were calculated using density functional theory in the Gaussian 09 programme. All the structures were optimized by hybrid B3LYP with a 6-31G (d) basis set. Then, the excited state characteristics were determined by TD-DFT with the B3LYP hybrid functional method and a 6-31G (d) basis set using the optimized ground state geometries.
Reactive oxygen species production
The production of ROS from free Cu(II)Chl and Cu(II)Chl–HA was investigated by using 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) as the capturer. A certain quantity of a DPBF solution (60 μL, 1 mg mL−1) was added to 2 mL of a Cu(II)Chl and Cu(II)Chl–HA solution, which was then exposed to 650 nm laser (0.3 W cm−2) irradiation. After irradiating for a set amount of time, the absorbance was measured by time-dependent absorption spectroscopy using a UV-Vis spectrometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu, Japan).
To detect the types of photoinduced ROS, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) were used as ROS spin-trap reagents. Experimental TEMP solutions were prepared by mixing 10 μL of Cu(II)Chl–HA (100 μg mL−1), 10 μL TEMP (0.8 M), and 80 μL PBS (pH 7.0). The DMPO solution of the same concentration was prepared following the same method as that of the TEMP solution. The solution was added to a quartz cell and irradiated with a 650 nm laser (0.3 W cm−2) for 5 min. Subsequently, the solution was injected into a capillary tube, and the spectra were recorded on a Bruker Model A300 spectrometer at room temperature. The EPR measurement parameters were as follows: frequency, 9.8 GHz; microwave power, 19.87 mW; sweep time, 27.65 s; sweep width, 200 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz.
DAB is a highly selective molecule toward 1O2, whereas it exhibits no response toward ˙OH or O2˙−. In addition, new methylene blue (NMB) has been reported to have a high 1O2 quantum yield under 650 nm laser irradiation. Hence, NMB can serve as a standard molecule to evaluate the 1O2-generation yield of Cu(II)Chl–HA.54 Hence, the 1O2 quantum yield of NMB (ΦNMB) was carried out under 650 nm laser irradiation (0.3 W cm−2). In detail, 200 μL of a 10 mM DAB solution in DMF was mixed with 2.8 mL of Cu(II)Chl–HA (50 μg mL−1). Then, the solution was irradiated with a 650 nm laser (0.3 W cm−2). The adsorption spectra were obtained after different irradiation times. To further quantify the ΦCu(II)Chl–HA, the following calculations were implemented. Previous studies have revealed that the 1O2 quantum yield is related to the initial reaction rate (Q) of 1O2 with a specific 1O2-capturing dye.54 According to the following equation, we assessed the Q of 1O2 using DAB in the presence of either NMB or Cu(II)Chl–HA by utilization of the above absorbance data:Q = R/Awhere R is considered to be equal to the value of the initial slope (ΔA/Δtime), and A is the absorbance of either NMB or Cu(II)Chl–HA at 650 nm.
Intracellular ROS production
The intracellular ROS production of Cu(II)Chl–HA was detected with the DCFH-DA stain under photoirradiation. Briefly, 4T1 cells were seeded into 24-well cell plates and incubated with or without Cu(II)Chl–HA (100 μg mL−1) for 6 h. The culture medium was removed and washed twice with PBS. Following incubation with DCFH-DA (10 mM) for 30 min in the dark, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then irradiated with a 650 nm laser for 10 min at a power density of 0.3 W cm−2. After treatment of the cells, the corresponding fluorescence images were captured by a multi-mode microplate reader (Biotek Cytation 5).
Photothermal effect
The digital photothermal images of Cu(II)Chl–HA, pure water, PEG, and HA in aqueous solution were taken using an infrared thermal camera (MAG30, Magnity Electronics, China). An aqueous solution of Cu(II)Chl–HA (100 μg mL−1) was irradiated with a 650 nm laser (1.0 W cm−2). The heating temperatures were gradually recorded at different times (0–10 min) in the Magnity Electronics tool system. The photothermal performance of pure water was captured under the same circumstance.
Cell culture
Human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% (v/v) 100 U mL−1 penicillin and 100 mg mL−1 streptomycin. Mouse fibrosarcoma (L929) cells and mouse triple-negative breast cancer (4T1) cells were cultured in normal RPMI-1640 culture medium containing the same additions as DMEM. The cells were incubated under a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.
Cell viability
The cytotoxicity of Cu(II)Chl–HA was measured by MTT assays of the L929, HeLa, and 4T1 cell lines. The cells were seeded into a 96-well cell culture plate at a density of 1 × 104 cells per 180 μL per well and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 24 h. Twenty microliters of a Cu(II)Chl–HA solution at different concentrations (0, 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 μg mL−1) were added to each well and incubated for an additional 24 h. Thereafter, the MTT reagent (10 μL in PBS, 5 mg mL−1) was added to each well for another 4 h to test the cytotoxicity through Infinite M1000. The cytotoxicity was expressed as the percentage of cell viability compared to that of the untreated control cells. The cell viability was estimated according to the following equation:  where OD represents the optical density, and PBS-treated samples without laser irradiation were used as the control.

In vitro cellular uptake assay
To further verify the targeting capability of Cu(II)Chl–HA, ICP-OES was used to detect the cellular uptake through quantitative analysis of the Cu uptake. In detail, adhered L929, 4T1, and HeLa cells in a six-well plate were treated with 2 mL of fresh medium containing 200 μg mL−1 of Cu(II)Chl–HA for different times (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours). Subsequently, the cells were collected after being washed twice with PBS. Finally, the Cu concentrations in the different cells were measured by ICP-OES. In addition, an HA-blocked cellular uptake assay of Cu(II)Chl–HA was carried out following the same method to verify that the targeting capability of the NPs originated from the external HA chain.
Photo-induced cytotoxicity
Photo-induced cytotoxicity measurements were carried out on L929, 4T1, and HeLa cells. Cells were cultured in 96-well plates and were treated with Cu(II)Chl–HA (0, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 μg mL−1) for 6 h. After that, the cells were irradiated under a 650 nm laser at 1.0 W cm−2 for 5 min. Subsequently, the relative cell viabilities were evaluated by a standard MTT assay.
Individual photodynamic activity and photothermal therapy
To further evaluate the contributions of the individual photodynamic and photothermal treatments, two independent phototreatments were performed on adhered L929, 4T1, and HeLa cells treated with Cu(II)Chl–HA (0, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 μg mL−1) for 6 h in a 96-well culture plate. For the individual photodynamic effect, the cells were irradiated with a 650 nm laser at a power of 1.0 W cm−2 for 5 min with ice bath incubation. Afterwards, the relative cell viabilities were evaluated via the standard MTT assay. In addition, the photothermal cell-killing effect of Cu(II)Chl–HA was carried out under 650 nm laser irradiation (1.0 W cm−2) against treatment with excess ascorbic acid (2 mg mL−1) for 5 min. Next, the same standard MTT assay was carried out to assess the independent photothermal-induced cytotoxicity.
Animal model of subcutaneous 4T1 breast cancer
The animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH publication 85-123) and were approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of the Guangxi Medical University Laboratory Animal Centre. To grow the tumours, 2 × 106 4T1 cells were subcutaneously injected into the flank region of nude mice. The mice were stochastically allocated into four groups when the tumour volume reached approximately 100 mm3.

In vivo infrared thermal imaging and antitumour activity
The 4T1 tumour-bearing nude mice were divided into 4 groups (n = 5 for each group) and administered different treatments: saline (100 μL) (group 1), saline (100 μL) plus 650 nm laser irradiation for 5 min (group 2), Cu(II)Chl–HA (1000 μg mL−1, 100 μL) (group 3), and Cu(II)Chl–HA plus 650 nm irradiation (5 min, 1.0 W cm−2) (group 4). During the 650 nm laser irradiation, an infrared thermal camera (MAG30, Magnity Electronics, China) was used to monitor the temperature changes of the tumour sites. In addition, data such as the tumour sizes and body weights of the mice were collected every other day. The tumour volume (V) was calculated following the equation:  where a is the tumour length and b is the tumour width. The relative tumour volume was normalized to its initial size when the treatment was initiated. A group of five mice was used to assess the mean and standard deviation of the data. Finally, tumours were harvested and collected immediately for H&E staining.
Biodistribution
A total dose of 100 μL of saline solution of Cu(II)Chl–HA (1 mg mL−1) was intravenously injected into the tail veins of 4T1 tumour bearing female Balb/c mice. The tissues (lung, heart, spleen, kidneys, liver, and tumour) were removed at different time intervals (3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 7 days, and 14 days) after injection. Subsequently, each sample was digested with HNO3 for 24 h and washed with normal saline solution three times. The analysis of Cu content by ICP-OES (Flexar/NexlON300X, PerkinElmer) was carried out.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis of the samples was conducted by Student's t-test, p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant (*), p < 0.01 were very significant (**) and p < 0.001 were very significant (***). All data reported are means ± standard deviations, unless otherwise noted.
