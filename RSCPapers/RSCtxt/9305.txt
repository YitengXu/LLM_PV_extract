    , Accepted 15th June 2021First published on 28th June 2021AbstractIn recent years, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely used in various fields, especially in the field of electrochemical energy storage and conversion, because of their excellent properties. It is reported that Co-MOFs usually play the role of templates with other active components to improve the overall properties of materials. Pristine Co-MOFs have been widely used for battery applications because of their excellent performance as well as the simple fabrication process, which can eliminate concerns regarding poorly controlled pyrolysis. Herein, for a further specific summary of particular applications of Co-MOFs, we will mainly review the relative applications of Co-MOFs in lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, potassium-ion batteries, lithium–sulfur batteries and metal–air batteries. In this paper, the applications of pristine Co-based MOFs are reviewed in detail, which can provide a reference for future work.
1. Introduction
With the rapid development of social economy and the dramatic increase of global population today, the inevitable rapid growth of energy consumption has created a surplus use of fossil fuels as the energy source.1–4 This leads to not only depletion of the fossil fuels but also a catastrophic effect on the environment and human lives.5–7 In addition, this will create a bigger challenge of dealing with the consequence resulting from further deterioration of the environment in the future. Therefore, the exploration and development of renewable energy sources are especially important. Progress has also been made in the past few decades by exploiting renewable energy sources such as solar, tide and wind. However, in most cases, due to their intermittent characteristics, it is difficult for these energy sources to consistently provide sufficient power as needed. As a result, it has become imperative to develop either more controllable and flexible energy forms or more efficient energy storage technologies.8,9 Utilizing renewable energy sources with low environmental impact is the major need of this century. For instance, efficient methods can be adapted for electrochemical energy conversion or to achieve sustainable energy conversion. Simultaneously, the development of low-cost and large-scale energy storage systems is also essential.10 In all these cases, development of efficient and durable electrode materials is extremely important for the practical application of these energy storage systems.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are three-dimensional porous crystal structures formed by metal ions or clusters linked together with organic ligands. In recent years, due to their tunable sizes, volume and structure and high specific surface area, MOFs have attracted increasing research interest and have been widely used for supercapacitors, gaseous fuel storage, chemical hydrogen storage, energy conversion and storage applications, especially for the enhancement of different kinds of reaction in electrocatalysis,11–24 and electrodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),25,26 sodium-ion batteries (SIBs),27 supercapacitors and so on.28–30 Compared with traditional porous materials such as mesoporous carbon and zeolite, MOFs not only have larger specific surface area, but their structure and pore size can also be adjusted by metal ions or organic ligands, while the functional directional regulation can be realized by molecular design. MOF materials can provide rich active sites, and electrolyte ions can diffuse rapidly in their pores, which are proved to be ideal battery electrode materials.
As early as 1995, Yaghi's group had reported a coordination compound with 2D structure, synthesized with a rigid organic ligand 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) and Co, and named it as metal–organic framework (MOF).31 So far, transition metal based MOFs with a high theoretical capacity among many secondary battery electrode alternative materials have been of wide concern and frequently studied.32–34 In particular, in the field of fuel cells and metal–air batteries, pristine Co-MOFs have been widely used as electrocatalysts for their theoretically high electrocatalytic activity. Additionally, Co-MOFs are commonly synthesized into Co-related oxides, sulfides or some other forms with different morphologies being used as precursors. However, it is undeniable that pristine Co-MOFs also have their own advantages.35–40 The pristine Co-MOF fabrication process is simpler than forming their derivatives, to a large extent due to the elimination of the problems regarding poorly controlled pyrolysis. Related research about Co-MOFs has led to the publication of nearly 2000 articles over the past 10 years, with a continuously rising number of publications.
Recently, some reviews have been written regarding the applications of MOFs. For instance, Han et al. mainly focused on the main synthesis methods of MOFs and the research progress on MOF-based photocatalysts to degrade organic pollutants in water, such as organic dyes, pharmaceuticals, personal care products and other organic pollutants.41 Different strategies for the construction of electrochemical (EC) biosensors with monometallic MOFs, bimetallic MOFs, luminophore-combined MOFs and MOF-based nanocomposites were reviewed by Zhang and co-workers.42 Wang et al. discussed the different synthetic approaches of porphyrin-based MOFs and examined the current developments and achievements of porphyrin-based MOFs in the field of biomedical applications, especially cancer therapy and bioimaging in detail.43 Herein, for a further specific summary of particular Co-MOF applications, we will focus on the relative applications of pristine Co-MOFs in lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, potassium-ion batteries, lithium–sulfur batteries and metal–air batteries. Henceforth, this review will be providing an overview about Co-MOF-based materials' applications in detail, accordingly providing a reference for those researchers who would like to do further studies on Co-MOFs. Fig. 1 lists some of the structures of pristine Co-MOFs.

2. Cobalt-based MOFs for battery applications
2.1 Lithium-ion batteries
A lithium-ion battery is a rechargeable secondary battery which can meet the requirements of energy storage devices in many occasions due to its large energy density characteristics, making it a widely used energy storage device.44,45 Owing to the presence of metal ions and organic linkers, MOFs can provide redox active sites and open channels for transportation of lithium ions and electrons. Pristine cobalt-based MOFs possess advantages including redox activity, controllable crystal structure and high specific surface area.32 Because of their desirable features, Co-MOFs have been considered as eligible electrode candidates for LIBs.
As a typical transition metal element, cobalt has an atomic structure that easily gains and loses electrons, especially when it exists in the form of ions. Other than cobalt centers, some active organic functional groups in the organic frameworks such as carboxyl and amino groups can also play a role in nourishing the redox power, although in most cases organic frameworks only act as channels and carriers for ions and electrons. Early in 2014, a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) anode Co3[Co(CN)6]2 with a reversible capacity of 299.1 mA h g−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V was reported.46 The open framework structure of Co3[Co(CN)6]2 allowed rapid Li+ transport, resulting in considerable rate capacity from 20 to 2000 mA g−1. However, this anode suffers from a drastic capacity fading and low coulombic efficiency after the first cycle. Despite the inherent nature of the PBA, the multiple valence states of cobalt in charge/discharge processes confirmed the feasibility of utilizing cobalt ions due to their lithium insertion/deinsertion power. The capacity attenuation caused by the framework can be started from improving the stability and conductivity of organic ligands, while the required micro morphology can be obtained by selecting appropriate organic species and synthesis conditions, which are promising ways to reduce side reactions and structural degradation for enhancement of the cycling stability. Inspired by this, many kinds of Co-MOFs with different organic ligands and synthetic methods have been designed and developed for lithium storage and have been applied as anode materials for LIBs directly (Table 1).

In 2016, Wang and co-authors developed CoBTC-EtOH (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) via a straightforward hydrothermal method. The optimized product presented a reversible capacity of 473 mA h g−1 at a rate of 2 A g−1 after 500 cycles with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging indicated that the microsphere morphology of CoBTC-EtOH is largely retained after repetitive cycling. Moreover, XPRD patterns taken after galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling also confirmed the retention of the crystal structure.49 Additionally, Co-MOFs with nanostructures can provide a shorter transmission path and greater specific surface area, resulting in an abundant space for redox active sites and proper transport channels for electrolyte and metal ions. For example, Ge et al. prepared a kind of zigzag vermicular-like Co-BTC MOFs and investigated their electrochemical performance as an anode material.64 This electrode delivered a reversible capacity of 1739 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1, around 99% coulombic efficiency in the 199th cycle and more than 750 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V, indicating that nanosized MOFs can be future anode materials for LIBs. Later, in Shi and co-workers' study, a layered coordination polymer, [Co(tfbdc)(4,4′-bpy)(H2O)2] (Co-LCP), was successfully obtained using tetrafluoroterephthalic acid (tfbdc) and 4,4′-bipyridine (4,4′-bpy) as organic ligands via a simple hydrothermal method (Fig. 2c).65 Owing to interspaces for diffusion and storage of electrolyte solution, the Co-LCP electrode shows a stable capacity of 545 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, which is higher than the theoretical capacity of graphite. Similarly, hierarchical Co-based metal–organic frameworks (H-Co-MOFs) with unique hierarchical structure and large surface area were synthesized using 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid as the ligand by a simple solvothermal method, exhibiting ultrahigh reversible capacities and excellent long-term cycling performance.66 As shown in Fig. 2d, H-Co-MOF is constructed using microflowers, providing a high specific surface area for lithium ion loading and electrolyte transmission. In the development of nano-electrode materials, regulation of advanced structures and further study of redox mechanisms are the main concerns of researchers.

For one thing, an adjustable organic linker moiety facilitates the reversible lithiation/delithiation process by reverting to the initial morphology, indicating that microstructure controlled by using different ligands is a key point for MOF-based anode construction. In addition to Co-MOF anodes constructed by nanosheets, other Co-MOFs with nanostructures have also been reported. For instance, polycarboxylate-based cobalt coordination polymer (CoCOP) nanowires were obtained by a facile and scalable method (Fig. 2e), delivering an impressive capacity of over 1100 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1 and durable cycling performance without any capacity decay after more than 1000 cycles.67 Later, in Dong's work, Co(L) MOF/RGO with the formula [Co(L)(H2O)]n·2nH2O/RGO (L = 5-aminoisophthalic acid, RGO = reduced graphene oxides) was fabricated by ball milling.68 Ball milling can effectively reduce the size of the crystals, shorten diffusion paths for Li+ and enrich the contact sites, leading to rapid charge–discharge processes and excellent lithium storage performance. The superior electrochemical performance of Co(L) MOF/RGO indicates that different coordination metal ions lead to different crystal structures and electrochemical reactivity. Porosity and small particle size are the structural advantages of MOF electrode materials. In Sengodu and co-workers' study, a Co-MOF (C32H28Co4O22) with a large number of interconnected pores exhibited a high discharge capacity of 600 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and 99.8% coulombic efficiency for 150 cycles.69 Afterwards, some similar porous or nano-scale Co-MOF-based anodes prepared with other kinds of organic ligands like [Co(L)]·1.5H2O (L = 3-carboxy-1-(4′-carboxybenzyl)-2-oxidopyridinium),70 Co-pydc (pydc = 2,5-pyridinecarboxylic),71 and 2D BP/NiCo MOF (benzenedicarboxylic acid as the ligand, BP stands for black phosphorus)72 have provided insights into morphology control while designing electrodes. Yu et al. developed a low-concentration-assisted heterogeneous-nucleation strategy for the direct growth of ultrathin metal–organic framework nanosheets (UMOFNs) on reduced graphene oxides (rGOs).73 The optimized Co-ZIF@rGO-F-25 displayed a stable capacity of 713.2 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles even at a high current rate of 1 A g−1. The excellent electrochemical properties can be ascribed to the rich open pores and conductive substrate rGO, which can provide abundant contact space for the access of electrolyte, accelerate charge transfer and promote Li-ion diffusion, resulting in the significant enhancement of Li storage. To understand the relationship between the superior performance and nanostructure, TEM image and XRD pattern tests after cycling test were applied. Both of them verified the existence of a foam-like ultrathin nanosheet network on rGO and a typical peak corresponding to the (002) plane of Co-ZIF, respectively, indicating that the structure of Co-ZIF@rGO-F-25 is well maintained during the charge/discharge process.
Moreover, in-depth studies showed that MOF-based anodes can work with a redox mechanism of ligand-dominating and metal–ligand-cooperating in addition to metal-valence-shifting, which make a great difference in the electrochemical activity of pristine MOFs. Generally, metal ions in MOF electrodes can act as active substances in the redox reaction while organic ligands provide insertion sites for lithium ions. Other studies demonstrated that metal-dependent spatial proximity and binding affinity play a critical role in the reversible redox processes.52 Interestingly, it has been confirmed that some organic skeletons can also play an important role in redox reactions. While working as a LIB anode, cobalt ions in Co-BDC (BDC = 1,4 benzene dicarboxylic acid) stay at the Co2+ state during the discharge/charge process.51 Likewise, a seashell-like Co-based metal–organic framework (S-Co-MOF), which works with an “organic-moiety-dominated” intercalation/deintercalation mechanism has been reported.74 As shown in Fig. 2a, Li-ions are intercalated in organic groups including carboxylate groups and benzene rings in the lithiation process. M-MOF-74 (M = Mn2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, etc.) is a potential candidate among various kinds of MOFs and possesses various metal centers and a high surface area.80 A kind of MOF-74, Co2(DOBDC) (DOBDC = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), was prepared via a hydrothermal method, whose Co ions remain in a divalent state during repeated Li+ intercalation/deintercalation.75 A novel cobalt 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalic coordination polymer Co-TFBTC displayed a high capacity, in which Co ions were not involved in the lithiation reaction.76 Moreover, some MOFs with redox sites involving both metal ions and organic ligands like u-CoTDA77 (TDA = 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid) and CoTPA78 (TPA = terephthalate) have been studied. Fig. 2f shows the CV curves of CoTPA with reduction peaks at 1.1 V and 0.7 V, indicating the redox behaviors of Co2+ and organic ligands, respectively. During the charge/discharge process, both Co ions and organic frameworks participate in redox reactions, resulting in a remarkable rate capacity and cycling performance, which is a novel idea for electrode materials. Making use of the synergistic effect of multiple redox active centers is a promising method to improve lithium storage capacity. It is noteworthy that previous experimental results suggested that a bimetallic system has better electrochemical performance over a monometallic system owing to the synergistic effect of two metal centers.81,82 Lou et al. synthesized CoZn-ZIF through a facile solvothermal approach and applied it as anode material for lithium-ion batteries. The charge capacity was stabilized at 605.8 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1 with CE approaching 100%, which is much better than that of Zn-ZIF-8 and Co-ZIF-67 because of the lithiation and delithiation of nitrogen atoms, accompanied by the breakage and re-coordination of the metal nitrogen bond (Fig. 2g and h).48 Similarly, the Ni/Co-MOF-74 electrode (Ni:Co = 5:10) exhibited a larger specific capacity (433.5 C g−1 at 1 A g−1) and better rate capability (359.1 C g−1 at 10 A g−1).83
Inspiringly, pristine Co-MOFs have not only showed potential for LIB anode materials but also paved wonderful paths for well-modified separators and simply assembled cathodes due to their suitable pores and aperture. For example, the pure polypropylene (PP) separator was coated with a cobalt-based zeolitic imidazolate framework named ZIF-67, greatly enhancing the cell's capacity retention (61.5%).84 The pores in the ZIF-67 coating not only promoted the adsorption and wettability of the electrolyte but also accelerated ion transport. Furthermore, bimetal MOF Li–Co-BTC (SNNU-73 and SNNU-76, in which SNNU stands for Shanxi Normal University) was prepared for cathode application.85 SNNU-73 with a spiral tunnel structure presented higher capacity because of the excellent lithium ion transmission efficiency, while SNNU-76 exhibited lower capacity attenuation owing to its nanocage structure with a superior stability. Moreover, Cai et al. modified the ordinary graphite anode with cobalt-based metal–organic frameworks (Co-MOFs) for lithium-ion batteries, and electrochemical test results illustrated that the anodes with graphite modified by 15% Co-MOF have shown excellent reversibility during lithiation and delithiation processes, low charge transfer resistance, and fast lithium-ion diffusion rate due to the electrochemical reactions of lithium ion on some limited graphite crystal planes.86 These research studies provide more possibilities for the application of pristine MOFs in LIBs.
2.2 Sodium-ion batteries
Compared with lithium batteries, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have obviously abundant sodium resource and low-cost advantages.87,88 Owing to the presence of active sites, porous structure and conductive organic linker moieties, Co-MOFs are proper candidates as SIB electrodes. However, low stability and poor electrochemical activity have limited their applications in most cases, especially for storage of metal ions with larger radius. When a larger volume of ions enters, the structure of the MOF is more likely to collapse, and the side reaction of sodium and electrolyte is more serious than that of lithium. Therefore, only a few reports about Co-MOFs as SIB electrodes have been reported till now because sodium intercalation chemistry is in need of further exploration and in-depth understanding.
Hollow Prussian blue analogue (CoFe-PBA) nanocubes were designed by removal of silica cores with hydrofluoric acid (HF) and investigated as a cathode material for SIBs (Fig. 3a).89 During this process, silica cores acted as sacrificial templates to form the hollow structure of CoFe-PBA nanocubes. As hollow CoFe-PBA exhibited higher capacity than the solid ones, microstructure control was of significance in MOF electrode design. Later on, core–shell PBAs with cobalt/nickel hexacyanoferrate coated with nickel hexacyanoferrate (CoNi-HCF@Ni-HCF) were fabricated by a self-assembly method (Fig. 3b), in which Ni acted as an inactive element while Fe and Co participated in redox reactions.90 As shown in Fig. 3e, CoNi-HCF was uniformly coated by Ni-HCF. With the protection of the inactive metal and a Ni-HCF layer that alleviated side reactions and lattice distortion, CoNi-HCF@Ni-HCF displayed high rate capacity and remarkable cycling stability. NaCoHCF was synthesized through a controlled crystallization reaction, which can serve as a high-performance and long-life cathode for aqueous Na-ion batteries for its perfect lattice framework with two redox-active sites.91 Meanwhile, the effects of different metal ions and coordination water toward the electrochemical properties of MOFs had been investigated. Dong et al. obtained [Co(L)-(H2O)]n·2nH2O (L = 5-amino-isophthalic acid) by a simple and versatile scalable solvothermal approach. They also found that MOF/RGO hybrid materials prepared by ball milling demonstrated better electrochemical performances (1185 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 50 cycles) than individual Co(L) MOFs.68

In addition to cathodes, Co-MOFs can also be applied to SIB anodes due to the Co2+ or organic ligands with redox activity, in which pristine MOFs play a similar role to that in LIBs. For example, Co2(OH)2tp (H2tp = terephthalic acid) ultrathin nanosheets (denoted as u-CoOHtp) and bulk MOF (denoted as b-CoOHtp) were prepared via a microwave-assisted solvothermal reaction with and without the ultrasonic procedure, respectively.92 As shown in Fig. 3c and d, b-CoOHtp presents a solid and dense lamellar crystalline architecture, whereas u-CoOHtp presents a densely accumulated and randomly assembled interconnected structure. The ultrathin nanosheet microstructure enhanced the capacity of u-CoOHtp by shortening the paths for Na+ and electron transmission. Although reducing the thickness or particle size is a useful way to enhance the electrochemical performance of Co-MOF anodes, the limitations of MOFs such as low conductivity cannot be overcome. Therefore, not only the redox activity but also the conductivity of organic ligands has been taken into consideration. Park et al. reported a 2D conductive MOF Co-HAB (HAB = hexaaminobenzene) with redox-active linkers and Co2+ centers.93 The three-electron reaction and excellent stability and conductivity of HAB led to the remarkable sodium storage performance of Co-HAB (Fig. 3f and g), which is a promising MOF anode for SIBs. According to the above studies, conductivity, stability, microstructure and redox activity are the main factors when considering pristine Co-MOF for SIB electrodes.
2.3 Potassium-ion batteries
As a kind of alkali metal ion batteries, potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) have been regarded as another alternative to LIBs due to their high working voltages and easy electrolyte conversion, although K+ ions have a larger size than Li+ and Na+ ions.94,95 Benefitting from the redox activity of Co centers in pristine Co-MOFs, intercalation and deintercalation of K+ can be realized by valence shift of Co. While working as an anode for PIBs, Co2+ in L-Co2(OH)2BDC converts to Co0 during potassiation (Fig. 5b).96Fig. 5c shows the layered crystalline architecture of L-Co2(OH)2BDC, which shortened the transmission distance of K+.
Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) have emerged as promising cathode materials for PIBs due to their high capacity and stable cycling performance.97 The working mechanism of a Co3[Co(CN)6]2 anode is even more complicated, in which Co presented more valence states (+3, +2, +1 and 0), which delivered high capacities of 324.5 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and 221 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 (Fig. 5e).98 Later, Canto-Aguilar et al. reported transition metal-modified hexacyanocobaltates as anode materials for K-ion batteries for the first time.99 In particular, Ni3[Co(CN)6]2-PBA showed specific capacities as high as ∼310 mA h g−1 in the initial discharge, suggesting that it was a promising material for applications in novel energy-storage technologies as K-ion batteries.
However, cobalt hexacyanoferrate K1.55Co0.88Fe(CN)6·3.2H2O showed a low discharge capacity of only ∼60 mA h g−1 due to the imbalanced structure during the charge/discharge process.100 Huang et al. made an effort to enhance the performance of potassium ion battery with cobalt-based PBAs as cathode materials by tuning/optimizing the composition of N connected metal ions.101 The battery with K2NiCoFe(CN)6 cathode with a high initial capacity of 86 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 98% after 50 loops not only displayed higher reversible capacity but also demonstrated better cycling performance than conventional PBC materials owing to the optimization of the chemical compositions/transition metal ions connected with the N end of the –CN– group. Table 2 lists the Co-MOF electrodes applied for PIBs.

2.4 Lithium–sulfur batteries
Lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) with high theoretical specific capacity of 1675 mA h g−1 and high theoretical energy density of 2600 W h kg−1have been regarded as one of the most promising high-energy chemical power devices.102,103 In addition, the abundant natural sulfur and metal lithium resources, low price and environmental benignity show the advantages of LSBs for practical applications.104,105 In 2011, Demir-cakan et al. first applied MOFs to lithium–sulfur battery cathode materials, and they used mesoporous chromium-based MOFs (MIL-100 (Cr)) as the cathode skeleton of lithium–sulfur batteries and injected S into this skeleton, which was further applied to lithium–sulfur battery cathodes, significantly improving the capacity retention rate of lithium–sulfur battery cathodes.106 As dissolution of polysulfides and transmission of Li+ easily takes place, Li dendrite and polysulfide shuttling would drastically decrease the coulombic efficiency and impede the development of LSBs. To alleviate mutual interference of reactions between two electrodes, well-designed separators that limit the growth of lithium dendrites and fix polysulfides are of prime significance. Recently, Li et al. reported a bifunctional separator based on an ultrathin Co-based MOF nanosheet that absorbed Li+ with O atoms on the surface and anchored polysulfides with a Co single atom.107 The as-designed separator effectively captured polysulfides with Co–O4 moieties and worked as a physical partition to hinder the growth of Li dendrites, which prevented internal short circuit and enhanced the cycling stability and reversible capacity. This work provided a novel method for simultaneous control of side reactions in both cathodes and anodes for LSBs by constructing a single-atom array mimic, which is also a promising strategy for other metal–sulfur batteries.
Surprisingly, sulfur can effectively impregnate and absorb into the Co-MOF structure by a sulfur melt-diffusion method.108,109 Qu et al. synthesized a Co-MOF with porous and defective structure using benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid as precursor and directly treated as an effective sulfur host material (CoMOF–S composite) in LSBs.110 Three CoMOF–S composite materials with different CoMOF and S weight ratios (1:1, 1:2, and 1:3) were prepared. The CoMOFS2 cathode manifested excellent high-rate performance, decreasing slowly from the reversible 1290 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C to 970, 840, 710, and 610 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 C, respectively. In addition, a capacity of 853 mA h g−1 was obtained when the current was recovered from 2.0 to 0.1 C, indicating a highly reversible, low fading in capacity. Additionally, Pang et al. synthesized PPy-coated hollow MOF composites (Fig. 4a). The SEM image of the as-obtained ZIF-67-S-PPy is shown in Fig. 4b.111 Taking advantage of the hollow structure (buffer the volumetric expansion) and coated electroconductive PPy polymer layer (solved the electroconductivity issue), the ZIF-67-S–PPy composite exhibited a higher cycling performance without a host material. The detailed mechanism of the sulfur host in LSBs is presented in Fig. 4f. The ZIF-67-S–PPy composite with a 60% sulfur content exhibited the highest specific capacity of 1092.5 mA h g−1 at 167.5 mA h g−1 and an average capacity of 354 mA h g−1 can be reached after the 200th loop with a high coulombic efficiency of over 95%.

2.5 Metal–air batteries
A metal–air battery is an efficient and safe energy conversion device which has a good application prospect in portable electronic devices, communication base stations and other fields. Air batteries can be generally divided into aluminum–air batteries, zinc–air batteries, magnesium–air batteries, lithium–air batteries, etc.112–115 The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is one of the most important cathode reactions in metal–air batteries.116,117 As a result, developing bifunctional electrocatalysts for highly efficient and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and ORR is of urgent need in order to realize the implementation of flexible rechargeable metal–air batteries.
Following the first studies on pristine Co-MOFs as LIB anodes, some attempts have been made in using them as electrocatalysts for zinc–air batteries (ZABs) while utilizing the redox activity of Co centers. Chen et al. investigated a cobalt-based MOF named Co(bpdc)(H2O)4 (bpdc = biphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid) as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst (Fig. 5a).118 During the ORR and OER, Co centers in Co(bpdc)(H2O)4 were oxidized into Co oxyhydroxides and acted as active catalytic centers (Fig. 5c). The as-constructed Co-MOF/graphite foam (Co-MOF/GF) delivered a much lower overpotential for the OER than Ir/C and a half-wave potential of 0.7 V. Similarly, to further explore the working mechanism of metal centers, two coordination polymers, Co3HITP2 and Ni3HITP2 (HITP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene), were synthesized and compared in electronic layout and crystallographic structure and were tested as air cathode catalysts.119 Consequently, Co3HITP2 displayed superior electrocatalytic activities than Ni3HITP2 in spite of the lower conductivity and crystallinity, which can be attributed to the 3d orbital configuration working via a four-electron pathway.

(g) Linear sweep voltammetry of the BTC-Co–O–Cu-BTA MOF, monometallic MOFs, Cu foil and Pt/C (electrode-rotating speed; scan rate: 2 mV s−1).127 
Instead of ZABs, Co-MOFs have also been applied as electrocatalysts for Li–O2. Indeed, the catalytic performance of Co-MOF-74 can also be optimized by adjusting its structure.120,121 MOF-74 is a range of materials with particularly excellent thermal stability and specific surface area in the MOF population.117,122,123 A series of ultrathin two-dimensional M-MOF-74 were made via a facile synthesis method.121 In addition, a high full discharge capacity of 11150 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 was achieved in MnCo-MOF-74.124 During the cycling test, MnCo-MOF-74 stably delivered a limited discharge capacity of 1000 mA h g−1 for 44 cycles at 200 mA g−1, which is distinctly longer than those of carbon black (8 cycles), Mn-MOF-74 (22 cycles), and Co-MOF-74 (18 cycles), benefitting from the porous structure of the MOF as well as the complementary contribution from both Mn and Co metal clusters. Due to Co-10/MCu–BTC's highly active Co sites, the mesopore structure of the supportive MCu–BTC proved beneficial for enhanced mass-transfer properties, and unsaturated Cu coordination in MCu–BTC enhanced electronic conductivity and auxiliary reactant affinity, causing them to perform satisfactorily toward bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis.125 These results illustrate that Co is a promising metal active center for ORR/OER catalysts and provides a new path for Co-MOF-based air electrodes without pyrolysis.
In addition to the bimetallic synergy strategy, the Co-MOF catalysts prepared using the multi-ligand strategy also have excellent bifunctional catalytic activity and durability. Co-BTC–IMI using benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acids (BTC) and imidazoles as co-ligands delivered an ORR half-wave potential of 0.80 V and an OER potential of 1.59 V.126 Surprisingly, BTC-Co–O–Cu-BTA was also synthesized via a low-temperature hydrothermal method using 1,2,4,5-benzene tetraamine (BTA) and BTC as ligands and Co and Cu as metal centres (Fig. 5f).127 This material substantially surpassed the electrocatalytic activity of other monometallic and bimetallic MOF materials as well as that of the Pt/C benchmark catalyst, which provides a novel idea for future improvement of these catalysts for metal–air batteries.
3. Conclusion
Pristine Co-MOFs have been widely used for battery applications as various functional materials. The formation of MOF-derived materials usually requires high-temperature pyrolysis and complex post-treatments, which not only hinder their large-scale implementation but also lead to inadequate control of particle size and distribution. From this perspective, the use of pristine MOFs could simplify the fabrication process to a large extent while eliminating the concerns regarding poorly controlled pyrolysis. In spite of these advantages of pristine Co-MOFs, a lot of difficulties remain to be solved for their applications in electrochemical areas.
Firstly, the toxicity and excessive cost of Co hinders the processes of Co-MOF application. Secondly, the relatively poor conductivity and the volume change during the charging and discharging process lead to the capacity decay of the electrode material during the circulation. Thus, it is necessary to adapt a series of measures such as inclusion, coating or structure optimization to improve their electrochemical performance. Finally, MOF structures are generally unstable in electrolyte systems, which lead to structural collapse, reduced number of active sites and hindrance of efficient ion transfer channels. Therefore, it is desirable to design and synthesize MOFs with high crystal structural/physicochemical stability to achieve excellent electronic performance. Furthermore, while developing efficient, sustainable environment-friendly power resources, complex organic ligands, organic liquid electrolytes and high energy density all mean high safety risks; thus, it is of primary importance to address all the safety challenges. To this end, researchers have taken a series of improved measures to implement.
(1) Usually, Co-MOFs can be obtained via facile and scalable methods like hydrothermal/solvothermal reactions. While investigating Co-MOFs as electrodes for batteries, introducing organic ligands with high conductivity, stability and redox capacity and improving the synergism between organic ligands and metals can contribute to more electrochemical activity. Sometimes, multiple ligands and metal binding are both good options.
(2) The mixed-metal strategy in the development of MOFs with specific endowed functionalities also has great potential. Partial substitution of Co with other metals, including resource-rich Ni, Mn and lightweight Li, Mg and Al, is expected to markedly promote the process of their industrial application soon by enhancing electrochemical properties, reducing costs, improving safety etc. In addition, adjusting the ratio of Co and other metals can also help to obtain better performance when using the bimetal-MOF strategy.
(3) Volume expansion during charging and discharging, irreversible capacity loss, and poor cycle stability hinder the development of traditional cobalt-based MOF materials. In order to solve these problems, many groups have tried various strategies including low-dimensional nanometer structure, hollow structure and preparation of nanocomposites. Low-dimensional nanostructures are efficient to afford fast electron and ion transport, while nanowires or nanotubes tend to attain stable structural integrity among various electrode conjugations. Meanwhile, dimensional reduction greatly reduces the thickness of material. Ultrathin MOF nanostructures not only could inherit the characteristics of the bulk MOFs but also possess a high percentage of exposed metal atoms on the surface.
(4) A variety of in situ or ex situ characterization analyses and theoretical calculations have been used to understand the mechanisms of electrochemical cycling and try to provide guidelines to meet the key challenges upon using Co-based MOF materials.
In conclusion, Co-MOFs have their unique advantages, and with the continuous improvement of the performance of Co-MOFs, they will become a key material for functional production of batteries.
