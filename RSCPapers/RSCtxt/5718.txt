The resultant poly(AA/PEG) gel electrolyte exhibited interconnected porous structures for holding the I−/I3− redox couple and the IL imbibed poly(AA/PEG) gel electrolyte demonstrates improved thermal stability and record room-temperature ionic conductivities of as high as 12.4 mS cm−1 from the full IL imbibed poly(AA/PEG) gel electrolytes. Moreover, a decently high light-to-electric power conversion efficiency of 6.12% is obtained from their dye-sensitized solar cells devices as compared with 5.32% achieved from a conventional acetonitrile-based poly(AA/PEG) gel electrolyte.
1. Introduction
Since the first prototype of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with an initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 7%, pioneered by Gratzel in 1991,1 DSSCs have attracted extensive and continuing attention over the past two decades due to their low fabrication cost, relatively high efficiency and environmentally friendly operation. To date, the record overall PCE of DSSCs employing a liquid electrolyte as high as 12% has been attained.2 However, a variety of demerits have been brought about by employing a liquid electrolyte, including a low ionic conductivity, solvent's leakage or evaporation, instability at high temperature and flammability, thus posing a threat to the long-term life and device performance of DSSCs and restricting their practical applications.
To tackle these issues, much effort has been devoted to the replacement of liquid electrolytes by quasi-solid-state/full-solid-state electrolytes. In particular, the porous quasi-solid-state polymer gel electrolytes have intrigued great interest because of their excellent advantages such as their non-flammability, negligible vapour pressure, and intimate contact with the nanoporous TiO2 anode and Pt counter electrode.3,4 Nonetheless, only a low PCE has been delivered when using polymer gel electrolytes. In a bid to enhance the device efficiency, much effort has been directed towards the design of a new gel electrolyte using newly synthesized polymers or polymer blends,5 or incorporating a third component such as inorganic nanoparticles.6,7 Different from conventional nanofillers, room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs) are salts that are in the liquid state at room temperature, composed of positively and negatively charged ions, and they usually exhibit a high ionic conductivity, appropriate high-temperature thermal stability and good compatibility with iodine and iodide in particular. Such an ionic liquid electrolyte can be further incorporated into a three-dimensional (3D) amphiphilic polymer frameworks to form quasi-solid-state polymer gel electrolyte.8,9 Among these studies, conductive polymers have been widely used to construct solid or quasi-solid electrolytes, such as polyaniline (PANi), polypyrrole (PPy), polythiophene, polyphenylenevinylene and polyacetylene, as they have demonstrated reasonable long-term stability, good electrical properties, and low cost.
In this study, a novel microporous copolymer poly(acrylic acid/ethylene glycol) (poly(AA/PEG)) with a 3D framework was synthesized using an aqueous solution method. Room-temperature IL electrolytes, in which 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM]BF4) is employed as a solvent and 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (MPII) as an iodide source, will be introduced into a novel porous polymer gel. Then quasi-solid-state DSSC devices will be assembled and the photoelectric performances and long-term stability are expected to be improved.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Absolute ethanol, iodine, lithium iodine, tetrabutylammonium iodide, 4-tert-butyl pyridine, acetonitrile, acrylic acid (AA), 1-methylimidazole, n-butyl chloride, acetic ether, sodium tetrafluoroborate, acetone, diethyl ether, poly(ethylene glycol) (molecular weight of 20000, PEG-20000), iodopropane, potassium persulfate, N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP), N,N′-methylene-bis-acrylamide, tetrabutyl titanate, nitric acid, and acetic acid were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Agent Company, China and used as received without further treatments.
2.2 Synthesis of room-temperature ionic liquid
The synthesis of the room-temperature ionic liquid [BMIM]BF4 involves the preparation of intermediate medium 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl) and the subsequent separation of [BMIM]BF4.
The [BMIM]Cl, [BMIM]BF4, and 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (MPII) were synthesized by following steps found in the literature.10,11 The detailed procedure of [BMIM]Cl and MPII can be found in the previously published study.12
0.2 mol [BMIM]Cl, 0.3 mol sodium tetrafluoroborate and 50.0 mL of acetone were mixed in a boiling flask at room temperature for 48 h under vigorous agitation. Then, the sediments were removed through filtering to obtain the suspension. 10 g sodium tetrafluoroborate and 30 mL of acetone were further added into the as-filtered suspension, followed by continuous agitation at room temperature for 24 h, and then filtering and distilling evaporation for 4 h. The finally obtained suspension will be thoroughly rinsed with dichloroethane, shaken and then kept static for 1 h, followed by distilling for 4 h to obtain the ionic liquid [BMIM]BF4.
2.3 Synthesis of poly(AA/PEG) matrix
1 g of PEG-20000 was dissolved into 10 mL of deionized water at 80 °C under vigorous agitation for 10 min. Then, 10 g acrylic acid (AA) and cross-linker N,N′-methylene bisacrylamine (NMBA) (mass ratio of NMBA to AA = 0.001:1) were added into the PEG solution and stirred for 5 min. Subsequently, the polymerization of AA by the initiator potassium peroxydisulfate (KPS) (mass ratio of KPS to AA was 0.01) and the post-treatment of the synthesized sample can refer to the procedure reported elsewhere.12 The prepared sample is shown in Fig. 1a.

2.4 Preparation of ionic liquid imbibed gel electrolytes
The IL imbibed poly(AA/PEG) gel electrolyte was fabricated in a similar way as performed before:13–16 in brief, first 3 mL of ionic liquid [BMIM]BF4, 1 mL of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (MPII), and 1 mL of NMP were added into a test tube and shaken and then 0.067 g LiI and 0.6345 g I2 were added to the IL solution and shaken for 10 min until completely dissolved. Finally, poly(AA/PEG) gel was immersed into the above electrolyte solution to form the IL imbibed gel electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 1b.
2.5 Assembly of quasi-solid-state DSSCs
A layer of TiO2 nanocrystal anode film with an area of 0.25 cm2 was prepared by coating the TiO2 colloid using a screen printing technique, followed by sintering in air at 450 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the TiO2 film was soaked in a 0.3 mM N719 [cis-di(thiocyanato)-N,N′-bis(2,20-bipyridyl-4-carboxylic acid-4-tetrabutylammonium carboxylate), purchased from Solaronix, SA, Switzerland] ethanol solution for 24 h to uptake the N719 dye for the fabrication of a dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode. Quasi-solid-state DSSCs from the full-ionic liquid imbibed poly(AA/PEG) gel electrolyte was fabricated by sandwiching a slice of the gel electrolyte between a dye-sensitized TiO2 anode and a Pt counter electrode.
2.6 Characterizations
The photovoltaic performance of the solar devices was characterized on an Electrochemical Workstation (Xe Lamp Oriel Sol3A™ Class AAA Solar Simulators 94023A, USA) under irradiation by a simulated solar light from a 100 W xenon arc lamp in ambient atmosphere to obtain the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves. The incident light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5). The fill factor (FF) and light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency (η) were calculated according to the equations: 
(1) 
(2)where Jsc is the short-circuit current density (mA cm−2), Voc is the open-circuit voltage (V), Pin is the incident light power, Pmax is the maximum power output, and Jmax (mA cm−2) and Vmax (V) are the current density and voltage at the point of maximum power output, respectively.
The molecular structure and functional groups of the prepared samples were characterized and confirmed by the 1H NMR spectra on a Bruker Advance-400 spectrometer and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra on a Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker). The thermal stability of the samples was studied using thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) on a TA Instruments Model SDT Q600 thermogravimetric analyser at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 flow of 90 mL min−1. A pocket conductivity meter (HANNA8733, Hanna Instruments) was employed to determine the ionic conductivity of the gel electrolyte.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology of the synthesized gel
To reveal the internal microstructure of the poly(AA/PEG) framework, the cross-sectional SEM image of the freeze-dried samples was shown in Fig. 2. It is clear that the resulted poly(AA/PEG) exhibits a well-interconnected, semi-interpenetrating porous network, thus favouring the capture of a large number of liquid electrolyte molecules. The capacity to uptake liquid electrolytes is strongly dependent on the pore size and porosity, both of which can be controlled by designed experimental conditions such as the loading amounts of initiator, cross linker and reaction temperature. However, it is worth mentioning that attention in this study is given for employing an amphiphilic hydrogel material as a liquid electrolyte supporter and it is also believed that even if the liquid electrolyte had been absorbed, it could still behave in a similar way as a free liquid electrolyte because it could transport freely within the 3D framework.9,12

3.2 Structure analysis of IL imbibed gel electrolyte
The structures of the synthesised [BMIM]BF4 and MPII were characterized by 1H NMR and FTIR spectra. As shown in Fig. 3a, the 4 splitting peaks at δ = 1.0, 1.4, 1.8 and 4.3 correspond to the hydrogen atom positions (1), (2), (3) and (4) in the n-butyl. The single peaks at δ = 3.9 and 8.8 correspond to hydrogen atoms at position (7) and (8), respectively, while the peaks of (5) and (6) are hydrogen atoms which couple into one single peak at δ = 7.6. The peak at δ = 8.8 corresponds to the hydrogen atom at position (8) while the peak at δ = 4.8 arises from D2O. According to the 1H NMR spectrum, the synthesized product can be ascribed to [BMIM]BF4. As observed from the 1H NMR spectra of MPII in Fig. 3b, the 3 splitting peaks at δ = 1.0, 2.1 and 4.3 correspond to the (1), (2) and (3) positioned hydrogen atoms of n-butyl, whereas the peak located at δ = 4.0 can be attributed to the H atom of position (4). The H atoms located at (5) and (6) have been coupled into a single peak located at δ = 7.7. Moreover, the peaks at δ = 8.9 and 4.8 stem from the (7) H atom and D2O, respectively.

As observed from the IR spectra in Fig. 3c, the absorption peaks at 2970 and 2870 cm−1 can be ascribed to the stretching vibration of C–H in the side chain of –CH3 while those at 1574 and 1170 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibration of CN and bending vibration of C–H. It is worth mentioning that the peak at 3435 cm−1 arises from residual water in the sample. All these spectra indicate the successful synthesis of [BMIM]BF4. Likewise, in the case of MPII, the absorption peaks at 2970 and 2870 cm−1 can be ascribed to the stretching vibration of C–H in the side chain of –CH3 while the peak located at 2930 cm−1 is the stretching vibration of C–H in the –CH2. The absorption peaks at 1571 and 1169 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibration of CN and bending vibration of C–H in the imidazole ring. As shown in Fig. 3d, all the absorption peaks closely resemble those observed from Fig. 3c, indicating that the ionic liquid has successfully penetrated into the 3D framework of the poly(AA/PEG) gel.
3.3 Thermal stability of IL imbibed gel electrolyte
The TGA curves of pure poly(AA/PEG) and full-ionic liquid imbibed poly(AA/PEG) gels are shown in Fig. 4. It can be observed that both of them have almost identical weight loss in the range of 30–150 °C, indicating that the absorption of the IL does not influence the stability of the gel. In other words, the introduction of the IL could form encapsulations within the gel, which is not prone to damage the interconnected structures of the gel (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the weight loss in the poly(AA/PEG) gel mainly occurs at 250–450 °C, whereas that of the IL gel electrolyte mainly happens in the range of 300–450 °C. After the introduction of the IL, the initiating temperature of weight loss has been enhanced probably due to the hydrogen bonding and entanglement between the IL and the AA/PEG in virtue of intermolecular forces.17–19 Therefore, the good thermal stability makes the ionic liquid [BMIM]BF4 a good candidate for an electrolyte solvent and IL imbibed poly(AA/PEG) a promising conducting gel electrolyte in quasi-solid-state DSSC devices.

3.4 Loading and ionic conductivity of IL imbibed gel electrolyte
In this study, the IL loading as a function of days and the corresponding ionic conductivity of the IL imbibed poly(AA/PEG) gel electrolyte were studied and the results are shown in Fig. 5a. It can be observed that with the increase of imbibition time, the IL loading sharply increases, reaches a maximum value of 22 g g−1 and levels off after an imbibition time of 11 days. Correspondingly, the highest ionic conductivity of 12.4 mS cm−1 was simultaneously attained at an imbibition time of 11 days, after which both the loading and ionic conductivity of the IL level off and almost keep constant. Herein, the ionic liquid exhibits an equivalent ionic conductivity to that of other liquid systems and bears a similar conduction mechanism,20 which mainly benefits from the inter-connective 3D framework, provides space and favors the transport of I−/I3−.
 Fig. 5  (a) Dependence of loading and ionic conductivity of the IL-based poly(AA/PEG) gel electrolyte on imbibition time and (b) dependence of the ionic conductivity on temperature at different imbibition times. 
The relationship between conductivity and temperature (i.e., σ–T) for the IL imbibed poly(AA/PEG) gel electrolyte at various imbibition times ranging from 1, 3, 5 to 10 days are shown in Fig. 5b. It is shown that ionic conductivity increases with increasing temperature and the ln(σ) versus 1/T exhibits an almost linear relationship, which agrees well with the previous studies.9,21 The enhancement of conductivity with temperature can be attributed to the enhancement of ion transportation. On the one hand, with the increase of temperature, the free volume gradually increases as observed from SEM images in Fig. 2, which has been observed in another different but similar system,21 and the ions that were initially confined within the gel network are more readily prone to transport; on the other hand, the transport mobility of the ions themselves increases with the increase of temperature, thus obtaining the higher ionic conductivity. The conductivity–temperature (σ–T) relationship can be well described by Arrhenius equation: 
(3)where A is a constant, Ea is the activation energy, kB is the Boltzmann's constant and T is the absolute temperature. The calculated Ea values of the IL-based poly(AA/PEG) gel electrolyte at different imbibition times of 1, 3, 5, and 10 are 30.34, 28.54, 26.22 and 23.43 kJ mol−1, respectively, indicating that with the increase in imbibition time, the interconnected porous 3D framework of the poly(AA/PEG) has captured more IL molecules and this will lead to better ionic conductivity. The decreased Ea value in the electrolyte suggests an energetically favorable ion transport process.9
3.5 Photovoltaic behaviors of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs
The photovoltaic performance, i.e., photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curve, of quasi-solid-state DSSCs made from different gel electrolytes is displayed in Fig. 6. It can be observed that after incorporation of the IL, the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and filling factor (FF) have been enhanced from 0.685 V, 12.32 mA cm−2 and 0.63 to 0.710 V, 12.68 mA cm−2 and 0.69, respectively, thus obtaining a PCE of 6.12% as compared with that of 5.32% made from traditional acetonitrile-based DSSCs. The origin of performance enhancement is associated with the introduction of an IL into the 3-D poly(AA/PEG) network, which renders better ionic conductivity and extends electro-catalytic interfaces, thus resulting in a lower energy loss and enhanced Jsc and conversion efficiency. The slightly increased FF may be associated with the pore filling of the IL due to the porous microstructures (Table 1).

4. Conclusions
In this study, a novel durable gel electrolyte has been successful synthesized by imbibing iodide-containing room-temperature ILs into the interconnective 3D porous frameworks of poly(AA/PEG) matrices. A record ionic conductivity of 12.4 mS cm−1 together a maximum IL loading of 22 g g−1 has been attained with the IL imbibed poly(AA/PEG) at an imbibition time of 11 days. The quasi-solid-state DSSCs have demonstrated a decent PCE of 6.12% using full-ionic liquid imbibed poly(AA/PEG) gel electrolytes, as compared with those made from an acetonitrile-contained poly(AA/PEG) gel electrolyte (5.32%). Moreover, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs made from the IL imbibed poly(AA/PEG) gel electrolyte exhibits an improved thermal stability compared with devices made from conventional acetonitrile-based gel electrolytes. This study highlights an avenue to boost the device performances of DSSCs and underpins the competitive edges of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs over other PV devices.
