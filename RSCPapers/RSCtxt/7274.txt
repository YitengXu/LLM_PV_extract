1. Introduction
Semiconductor nanostructures have attracted considerable attention in the past few decades because of their unexpected physical and chemical properties, as well as potentially important applications in multidisciplinary fields such as energy conversion, electrics, catalysts, sensors and so on.1–10 It is well-recognized that the performances of semiconductor nanostructures strongly depend on a set of parameters such as the size, morphology, composition and crystallization.11–15 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that hybrid semiconductor-based nanostructures can display new synergistic properties that arise from the interaction between the disparate components to improve the performances of the original semiconductors.16–25 Therefore, significant effort should be devoted to exploring effective methods for the rational design and synthesis of desired hybrid semiconductor-based nanostructures.
Cuprous oxide (Cu2O), as a non-stoichiometric p-type semiconductor, has been extensively studied due to its prospective application in antibacterial activity,26 photocatalysts,27 gas sensors,28 and solar-driven water splitting,29 carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation,30,31 solar energy conversion,32 negative electrode material for lithium-ion batteries,33,34 and metal–insulator–metal resistive switching memory35 and chemical template.36–56 The progress in nanomaterials science and nanotechnology has greatly accelerated the development of the synthesis and application of Cu2O nanostructures. So far, a number of Cu2O architectures with various morphologies have been successfully synthesized.57–137 Recently, progress and perspective on polyhedral Cu2O nanostructures have been well demonstrated.137,138 Especially, the facet-dependent properties of polyhedral Cu2O nanocrystals have received extensive attention.138,139 Although a better understanding of the facet-dependent property is necessary to prepare novel architectures with enhanced performances, the relatively large sizes and instabilities of Cu2O crystals will limit their practical applications. Therefore, it is imperative to expand the application of Cu2O crystals.
Hybrid Cu2O-based nanostructure, as a significant class of multicomponent heterogeneous architectures, could bring unexpected properties for improving the potential applications of Cu2O.140 The investigation of the synthetic strategy and formation mechanism of different hybrid Cu2O-based nanostructures offers a good opportunity to understand the fundamental principles for enhancing the desired performances. The correlations between the improved performances and interfacial structures of the hybrid Cu2O-based heterogeneous nanostructures are preliminarily uncovered. Therefore, a broad range of novel hybrid Cu2O-based nanostructures with enhanced performances has been controllably designed and fabricated. However, the systematic review of hybrid Cu2O-based nanostructures has not been reported so far.
In this review, we selectively summarize the synthesis strategy, the principle for enhanced performance and the application of different hybrid Cu2O-based nanostructures and cover the recent progress in this field (see Fig. 1). We start with a general survey of solution-based synthetic strategies of hybrid Cu2O–metal heterostructures for tailoring their crystallographic facets and morphologies; especially the synthesis of metal decorated Cu2O heterostructures and metal@Cu2O core/shell architectures will be described in detail. Next, hybrid Cu2O–metal oxide heterostructures and their potential applications are presented, and we also summarize the relationship of interface–property–performance. Finally, we illustrate the significance of using the Cu2O component to prepare hybrid Cu2O–carbon heterostructures and their applications. Remarks on promising research directions of different hybrid Cu2O-based nanostructures are also given.

2. Hybrid Cu2O–metal nanostructures and their applications
During the past decade, an extensive investigation of hybrid Cu2O–metal nanostructures has been carried out because multiple functions can be incorporated into a single system owing to the wide applications and fascinating new properties induced by the hetero-interfaces.140 The electronic structures and physicochemical properties of the hybrid Cu2O–metal nanostructures strongly depend on the rational arrangement of the multi-components within the heterostructures. Thus, the spatially controllable synthesis of hybrid Cu2O–metal nanostructures is an urgent issue.141,142 So far, there are mainly two kinds of hybrid Cu2O–metal heterogeneous systems, and a schematic illustration of the growth manner and geometrical model is shown in Fig. 2. The ability to controllably combine metal nanoparticles with a Cu2O semiconductor is of special interest in that it can allow us to understand the interaction manner between the metal and the semiconductor to obtain preferred metal–semiconductor heterostructures.143

In this section, we will elaborate the Cu2O-reactant strategies for synthesizing novel hybrid Cu2O–metal heterogeneous nanostructures. Firstly, the formation mechanism and application of the metal/Cu2O (metal decorated on Cu2O) heterogeneous nanostructures with controllable building blocks will be introduced. After this, we will especially discuss the synthesis method, formation mechanism and application of metal@Cu2O core/shell nanostructures.
2.1. Hybrid metal/Cu2O nanostructures
It is well-demonstrated that the formation of a Schottky barrier at the metal–semiconductor interface can effectively prevent the recombination of the photo-electrons and photo-holes during a photocatalytic process; thus the photocatalytic efficiency of the original semiconductor can be obviously improved.144,145 Recently, hybrid metal/Cu2O nanostructures have been extensively investigated.140,146–157 Multifunctional metal/Cu2O heterogeneous nanostructures, such as Cu/Cu2O,140 Au/Cu2O,146–150 Ag/Cu2O,151–155 Pt/Cu2O,156 and Pd/Cu2O,157 have been prepared by galvanic reactions or photo-irradiation between Cu2O and different metal salts. Therefore, precisely tailoring of the metal/Cu2O heterogeneous nanostructures and the thorough understanding of their formation mechanisms are imperative.

Hybrid Cu/Cu2O heterogeneous nanostructures. 
In 2009, it was reported that a copper rich or oxygen deficient surface can make a Schottky barrier for promoting the photocatalytic performance.158 Inspired by this viewpoint, the unique Cu/Cu2O heterogeneous nanostructures have been synthesized by a facile solution-phase reduction route.140 A low-magnification scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the polyhedral 26-facet Cu/Cu2O heterogeneous nanostructures is shown in Fig. 3a,140 and the selective formation of rough Cu/Cu2O surfaces can be successfully achieved. From a crystallographic viewpoint, different exposed facets have different characteristic properties due to the difference in atomic arrangement, lattice symmetry and spacing. The reduction of a Cu2O generally initiates from the surface; thereby to shed light on the facet-dependent reducibility of Cu2O is necessary. The reducibility of a Cu2O can be uncovered by the bond length between the oxygen atom and the copper atom. Previously, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to understand the structural properties of Cu2O(111), Cu2O(110) and Cu2O(100), which indicated that the bond length between the oxygen atom and the copper atom in the (111) facet was larger than that of (110) and (100) facets (see Fig. 3b).140 Therefore, the results demonstrate that the (111) surface of Cu2O is much more facile to be reduced than the (110) and (100) surfaces, finally leading to the selective growth of Cu nanoparticles on Cu2O (111) surfaces. The successful preparation of Cu/Cu2O heterostructures provides an opportunity to extend the photocatalytic activities of non-noble metal–semiconductor materials. These novel Cu/Cu2O heterogeneous architectures show better adsorption and photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) than those of the original Cu2O architectures (see Fig. 3c). The formation of the Cu/Cu2O heterogeneous nanostructures not only makes the purposive crystal design of spatial arrangement possible, but also offers a good opportunity to understand the foundational importance of low-cost Cu nanoparticles for improving the photocatalytic activity of Cu2O.

Typically, the above selective in situ formation of Cu nanoparticles on Cu2O surfaces can be described by the following reaction: 2Cu2O + N2H4 → 4Cu + N2↑ + 2H2O(1)
Notably, Cu2O can further be reduced to form pure Cu by increasing the reaction time and the amount of reducer in an aqueous solution at higher reaction temperature.159


Hybrid Au/Cu2O heterogeneous nanostructures. 
On account of the fact that the redox pair of Cu2O/Cu2+ (+0.203 V, vs. SHE) is much lower than that of a noble metal redox pair, such as PtCl62−/Pt (+0.735 V, vs. SHE), AuCl4−/Au (+0.99 V, vs. SHE) and PdCl42−/Pd (+0.591 V, vs. SHE),160–162 Cu2O can be potentially used as the sacrificial precursors for the synthesis of hybrid noble metal/Cu2O nanostructures. The formation process of noble metal nanoparticles can be illustrated as the following reaction (eqn (2), which mainly involves two steps: (i) the desired growth of Cu2O crystals and (ii) the formation of M/Cu2O (M = Au, Pt and Pd) heterogeneous structures in AuCl4−, PtCl62− or PdCl42− aqueous solution (see eqn (2)): 3Cu2O + 2H+ + 2MClx− + H2O → 6Cu2+ + 2xCl− + 4OH− + 2M(2)
Similarly to that occurring in the above Cu/Cu2O system,140 Liu has demonstrated that the selective growth of Au nanoparticles on (111) surfaces of truncated octahedral and cuboctahedral Cu2O crystals can also been achieved.146 The density and size of Au nanoparticle can be facilely controlled by tuning the concentration of the Au precursor (see Fig. 4a). It can be clearly seen that a large number of Au nanoparticles were formed on (111) surfaces of the Cu2O crystals at lower concentration of HAuCl4, but almost none of the nanoparticles were produced on (100) surfaces. Upon increasing the concentration of HAuCl4, perfect Au/Cu2O core/shell heterostructures were obtained. So AuCl4− species can be preferentially absorbed on (111) surfaces and reduced by Cu(I) sites on these surfaces in an appropriate concentration of precursor. From the above results, it can be found that the (100) surfaces of Cu2O are difficult to reduce to form Au nanoparticles at a lower concentration of HAuCl4. However, when the Cu2O nanocube colloid (wholly exposed with six (100) facets) was injected into HAuCl4 at room temperature in the presence of ultrasound radiation, in situ growth of Au nanoparticles on the surfaces of Cu2O nanocubes can be readily achieved.147

As for the (111) surface of Cu2O, it is interesting to understand the reaction activity of different specific positions, such as the apex, edges and facets. Du and coworkers have chosen octahedral Cu2O as templates for synthesizing Au/Cu2O heterogeneous nanostructures because the diversity of the surface energy distribution of octahedral Cu2O would result in the selective growth of Au nanoparticles at specific positions of {111} surfaces.148,149 The evolution of Au/Cu2O heterostructures involves the following four steps: (i) the selective adsorption of AuCl4− ions on vertices of octahedral Cu2O. (ii) The in situ formation of Au nuclei through galvanic reaction and the selective growth of Au nanoparticles on the vertices. (iii) The change of the selective growth route from along the crystal edges to along the {111} facets. (iv) The formation of Au nanoparticles. A schematic illustration of the surface-free-energy-distribution induced selective growth of Au nanoparticles on Cu2O octahedra with morphological evolution is shown in Fig. 4b.148 The photocatalytic performances of the as-prepared Cu2O and Au/Cu2O heterostructures for the degradation of MO are investigated. As expected, the Au/Cu2O heterostructures exhibit higher photocatalytic performances than pure Cu2O semiconductors. Notably, the formation Au/Cu2O heterostructures led to a dramatic improvement in the photocatalytic activities because of the electron–hole recombination being suppressed. However, the photocatalytic performances of the Au/Cu2O heterostructures were not improved with further increase of the loading amount of Au nanoparticles.148 The reduced photoactivity may be partially attributable to the relatively high Au loading in this system, which might decrease the total effective surface area of the Cu2O semiconductor during the photocatalytic degradation of MO.
In addition to the above spontaneous redox reaction, Au/Cu2O heterostructures with tunable coverage of Au were successfully synthesized by a facile method of mixing Au nanoparticles with Cu2O nanowires in a functional group solution-phase system. Xu and coworkers have found that superhydrophobic poly(o-anisidine)-capped Cu2O nanowires provide strong hydrophobic host–guest interactions with oleylamine-capped Au nanoparticles to form semiconductor–metal nanoparticles.150 When poly(o-anisidine)-capped Cu2O nanowires and oleylamine-capped Au nanoparticles are mixed and dispersed in chloroform, their hydrophobic–hydrophobic interactions cause spontaneous formation of Au/Cu2O heterostructures. The oleylamine capped Au nanoparticles are immobilized onto the poly(o-anisidine)-capped Cu2O nanowires so as to lower the surface energy through hydrophobic–hydrophobic interactions, leading to the formation of Au/Cu2O heterostructures (see Fig. 4c).150


Hybrid Ag/Cu2O heterogeneous nanostructures. 
Although Cu2O has been used as a weak reducing agent to synthesize Cu/Cu2O and Au/Cu2O heterostructures by the spontaneous redox route, it is difficult to obtain Ag/Cu2O heterostructures through the direct reaction between AgNO3 and Cu2O, so a modified synthetic strategy should be developed. Wang and coworkers have prepared uniform nanosheet-assembled silver hollow microcubes using Cu2O cubes as a template. In this reaction, AgNO3 acts as a metal source and trisodium citrate acts as a stabilizer and shape-directing agent.151 The whole reaction process could be generally written as eqn (3). Clearly, both the concentrations of H+ ions and Ag+ ions strongly affect the reaction rate. Inspired by the above reaction mechanism, Ag+ ions can be reduced by the primary Cu2O nanospheres in the acidic solution, and the obtained Ag nanoparticles can be deposited on the surfaces of the Cu2O nanospheres. The corresponding SEM image, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images are shown in Fig. 5a.152 Similarly, hollow Ag/Cu2O heterostructures with enhanced surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) have been successfully designed and constructed by the reduction of AgNO3 with sodium citrate in a Cu2O-containing mother solution (see Fig. 5b).153 2H+ + Cu2O + 2Ag+ → 2Ag + 2Cu2+ + H2O(3) Cu + 2Ag+ → Cu2+ + 2Ag(4) Cu + Cu2+ + H2O → Cu2O + 2H+(5)

However, it is still necessary to develop a facile approach to synthesize novel Ag/Cu2O heterostructures. Recently, a one-step hydrothermal synthesis of Ag/Cu2O heterogeneous nanostructures grown on a Cu foil was first reported, in which the Cu foil and AgNO3 were the only reactants involved in the preparation process.154
Ag and Cu2+ ions are generated by reaction (4), and the Cu2+ ion contacts with the Cu substrate to form Cu2O on the Cu foil by a redox reaction (5). During this process, Cu2O may be inclined to absorb OH−, leading to the formation of negatively charged species on their surfaces. Ag nanoparticles with high surface energies tend to absorb Ag+ ions and turn positively charged. Thus Cu2O and Ag are easy to interact with each other owing to the electrostatic attraction; finally the Ag/Cu2O heterogeneous nanostructures were formed.154
A photochemical irradiation method has also been successfully employed to deposit Ag nanoparticles onto the surfaces of Cu2O octahedral crystals (see Fig. 5c).155 The procedure for the synthesis of Ag/Cu2O heterostructures is as follows: first, octahedral nanocrystals were dispersed into distilled water by sonication. The distilled water was pre-heated by a water bath. Then the suspension was irradiated with a 500 W column-like iodine tungsten lamp. Under continuous magnetic stirring, AgNO3 solution was injected into the suspension, and the suspension was further irradiated to finally synthesize Ag/Cu2O heterostructures. When Cu2O is illuminated under visible light, electrons and holes can be photogenerated (eqn (6)). Ag+ cations can be reduced by photogenerated electrons to form Ag/Cu2O heterostructures (eqn (7)). The reactions can be proposed as follows: Cu2O + hν → Cu2O (ecb− + hvb+)(6) ecb− + Ag+ → Ag(7)

2.2. Hybrid metal@Cu2O core/shell nanostructures
The metal@Cu2O core/shell architectures are highlighted in the following subsection because the electronic structures and catalytic properties of core–shell heterostructures can be substantially modified through the special interaction between shell atoms and core atoms.163,164 Hybrid metal@Cu2O core/shell nanocomposites were proposed to improve the photocatalytic performances of Cu2O by suppressing the charge recombination and increasing the formation of active species by trapping photogenerated electrons.165 Therefore, understanding how the metal@Cu2O core/shell nanostructures cause the tunable synergistic properties is directly related to the capability to selectively implement desired performances into hybrid Cu2O-based nanomaterials.

Hybrid Cu@Cu2O core/shell nanostructures. 
In general, an oxidative reaction of pure Cu nanostructure has been widely used to generate a Cu2O-outside core/shell structure with a Cu core and a Cu2O shell (Cu@Cu2O). For example, core/shell heterostructured Cu@Cu2O nanowires with high aspect ratios were synthesized from Cu foams using a novel oxidation/reduction process under hydrogen and nitrogen atmospheres, which showed superior catalytic activities for the photodegradation of organic dyes under visible light irradiation.166 Core/shell heterostructured Cu@Cu2O nanodots can be prepared by the oxidation of Cu colloids (see Fig. 6a), which were found to be catalytically active for the generation of hydrogen from ammonia–borane.167 Core/shell Cu@Cu2O microspheres were synthesized by an interfacial hydrothermal method, which involved the in situ transformation from pure Cu to Cu2O.168 During this process, pure Cu microspheres were first formed through the reduction of copper(II) acetylacetonate. Then the Cu surface was oxidized to transform into a Cu2O shell, leading to the formation of core/shell Cu@Cu2O microspheres. These core/shell Cu@Cu2O microspheres exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity as compared to Cu2O on the degradation of gaseous nitrogen monoxide under visible light irradiation.

However, the transition metal Cu is difficult to obtain by the reduction of copper oxides in solution.168–170 As a result, it is a challenging task to prepare the Cu-outside structure with a Cu2O core and a Cu shell (Cu2O@Cu). Actually, Cu is expected to play a vital role as a shell because of its high activity in diverse reactions.171 So far, the literature on the successful synthesis of such a structure is very scarce. Therefore, the synthesis of Cu-outside core/shell Cu2O@Cu nanostructures is extremely desirable from both an academic and a practical viewpoint.
Kou and coworkers have synthesized inside-out core/shell architectures (Cu2O@Cu) with a Cu2O core and a Cu shell by reduction of Cu2O templates in a mix solution of ethylene glycol/sodium hydroxide/glucose (see Fig. 6b).172 The obtained Cu2O@Cu core/shell structure exhibits excellent catalytic activity in the Sonogashira coupling reaction, in which the high activity derived from the special architecture without a noble metal is fascinating. This Cu2O@Cu core/shell structure may provide a promising alternative for traditional noble metals for an economical Sonogashira coupling reaction. Recently, Ding and coworkers have found that a three-dimensional (3D) binder-free Cu2O@Cu nanoneedle array electrode can exhibit a high specific capacitance and excellent cycling stability with high capacitance retention. They have successfully constructed a Cu2O@Cu//AC supercapacitor, which possesses an energy density of 35.6 W h kg−1 at 0.9 kW kg−1 and excellent stability with a capacitance retention of 92% after 10000 cycles. Importantly, the in-series Cu2O@Cu//AC supercapacitors can light up LED arrays and even charge a mobile phone after being charged for dozens of seconds (see Fig. 7).173

Hybrid Au@Cu2O core/shell nanostructures. 
As one typical combination of metal nanoparticles with localized surface plasmon resonance and oxide semiconductors, Au@Cu2O has attracted a great deal of attention because of its novel structure and potential application in solar energy conversion.165,174–181
The Cu2O semiconductor has an appropriate high refractive index (2.705 in the visible region), resulting in a very strong influence of Cu2O on the localized surface plasmon resonance of embedded metal nanoparticles.165 The plasmonic Au@Cu2O core/shell heterostructures provide several advantages.177 First, such core/shell heterostructures can effectively protect the metal nanoparticles from corrosion. Second, it can maximize the metal–support interaction through the three-dimensional contact between the metal core and the semiconductor shell, thus facilitating the plasmonic energy transfer processes. Last, the local electromagnetic field of the localized surface plasmon resonance penetrates the shell, and can be used to control the center wavelength of the localized surface plasmon resonance. Especially, the core/shell Au@Cu2O heterostructures display interesting shell-dependent surface plasmon resonance light extinction on the nanoscale.165 Therefore, to explore the cooperative interaction between plasmonic Au and the Cu2O semiconductor as well as its special plasmon resonant property is imperative.
Tian and coworkers have synthesized Au@Cu2O core/shell nanoparticles to demonstrate the dramatic effect of the dielectric shell both experimentally and theoretically.178 The extinction spectra of Au@Cu2O nanoparticles with controllable thickness of shells exhibit not only a tunable red shift of the resonant peak but also distinctive enhanced absorption intensity and peak splitting (see Fig. 8a). The suitable dielectric shell-coated plasmonic nanoparticles could be very prospective, especially for the application that needs an effective enhancement of the plasmon resonant absorption.

Wang and coworkers have developed a robust seed-mediated synthetic approach,165 which can fine-tune several important geometrical parameters of the hybrid Au@Cu2O core/shell nanoparticles, including the thickness of the Cu2O shell, the size of the Au core, and the spacing between the core and the shell, to systematically and selectively fine-tune the synergistic light absorption and scattering properties of the composite over a broad spectral range across the visible and near-infrared regions. They have performed Mie scattering calculations to theoretically interpret the correlation between the geometrical parameters and the optical characteristics of the hybrid Au@Cu2O core/shell nanoparticles.
Facet-dependent localized surface plasmon resonance properties of polyhedral Au@Cu2O core/shell nanocrystals are very interesting to be investigated. Huang and coworkers have found that the localized surface plasmon resonance absorption band positions of the Au cores in the Au@Cu2O core/shell heterostructures are highly dependent on the surface facets of the single-crystalline Cu2O shells.179 Within a considerably large Cu2O shell thickness range, the surface plasmon resonance band positions of the Au@Cu2O core/shell nanocrystals are independent of the thickness of the shell, but shift progressively to the long wavelength side from octahedra to cuboctahedra and then cubes.
Furthermore, novel Au@Cu2O with a well-defined morphology can be easily synthesized by a seed-mediated aqueous solution method. Recent advances by Huang's group demonstrate that the shape-directed growth of Cu2O can be achieved by using different Au seeds to prepare interesting Au@Cu2O nanostructures.175,180 They have synthesized various Au@Cu2O core/shell heterostructures through different Au nanostructures (including nanoplates, nanorods, octahedra, and highly faceted nanoparticles) as the structure-directing cores for the overgrowth of Cu2O shells (see Fig. 8b). The Au cores guide the growth of Cu2O shells with controlled morphologies, which can be attributed to an unusual hollow-shell refilled growth mechanism not reported previously. Systematic shape-evolution of the Cu2O shells can be easily achieved by simply adjusting the volume of added reducer. For example, truncated cubic to octahedral Cu2O shells were produced from octahedral Au nanocrystal cores.180 Unusual truncated stellated icosahedral and star column structures have also been synthesized. Au@Cu2O convex cubes, cuboctahedra, and octahedra were synthesized by using rhombic dodecahedral and highly edge- and corner-truncated octahedral Au cores, respectively.175
In spite of the fact that the shape-directed growth of Cu2O can be realized by using Au seeds to form Au@Cu2O structures, the size control of Cu2O (especially octahedral Cu2O) is more difficult in hydrophilic media. Huang and coworkers have used heterogeneous nucleation, rather than homogeneous nucleation, of Cu2O with Au nanorods as seeds to realize the subsequent uniform crystal growth. Nearly monodisperse octahedral Au@Cu2O nanocrystals with single-crystalline shells were successfully synthesized (see Fig. 8c), in which the size control of the Cu2O shell can be achieved by adjusting the amount of Au rods.176 The result of a larger surface area and an improved charge separation from core/shell interaction has made Au@Cu2O with different sizes exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity compared to that prepared without Au seeds toward MO degradation.
Hybrid Au@Cu2O core/shell nanostructures have also become stronger candidates as gas sensors due to their controllable chemical and thermal stabilities within the protection of shells and effective charge separation between Au cores and Cu2O shells.181 In addition, the investigation of facet-dependent and Au core-enhanced electrical properties of Au@Cu2O heterostructures has been successfully demonstrated (see Fig. 8d).174


Hybrid Ag@Cu2O core/shell nanostructures. 
The Ag@Cu2O core/shell heterostructure has been demonstrated to be a candidate to solve the problem of corrosion or dissolution of the exposure of Ag nanoparticles. The electronic structures and properties of Ag@Cu2O core/shell heterostructures are substantially improved owing to the integrated interaction between the shell atoms and the core atoms. Ag@Cu2O core/shell nanostructures can also be prepared by a seed-mediated route. The controllable growth of Cu2O layers on Ag nanoplates can make different interfacial lengths in oxide–metal hybrid structures, leading to an excellent platform for investigating the effect of surface polarization on CO oxidation (see Fig. 9a).182 The geometry control of Ag@Cu2O core–shell nanoparticles can be synthesized through epitaxial growth of Cu2O nanoshells on the surfaces of various Ag nanostructures, which can exhibit geometry-dependent optical properties that are highly tunable across the visible and near-infrared spectral regions (see Fig. 9b).183 One-dimensional Ag@Cu2O core–shell heteronanowires have also been synthesized (see Fig. 9c), which display much higher plasmonic photocatalytic activities toward degradation of organic contaminants than Ag@Cu2O core–shell nanoparticles or pure Cu2O nanospheres under solar light irradiation. The enhancement in photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the surface plasmon resonance and the electron sink effect of the Ag nanowire core, and the unique one-dimensional (1D) core–shell nanostructure.184

The synthesis and applications of the above reported hybrid metal–Cu2O nanostructures are summarized in Table 1. However, the formation of multiple metal–Cu2O-based nanocomposites is less widely reported. Fortunately, hybrid Cu2O-based templates can be further used to synthesize a broad range of novel binary and ternary Cu2O-based heterostructures.56 For example, starting from monodisperse hybrid metal@Cu2O core/shell templates, metal@Cu2O@CuxE (E = S, Se, Te) nanocomposites will be synthesized through a replacement/etching approach. Based on the above result, metal@CuxE york–shell heterostructures can be converted from Cu2O shell through a modified Kirkendall process,184 and the obtained CuxE would then be employed as a solid precursor for further synthesizing new nanostructures through ion exchange mechanisms. Importantly, hybrid metal–Cu2O-based templates might be in progress to fabricate novel multi-walled or multi-compositional hollow nanostructures by removing the Cu2O components, such as metal@metal, metal@oxide york/shell architectures.56

As demonstrated previously, charge separation is significant for improving the activity of semiconductor-based solar energy conversion.157,185 Spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes among different crystal facets of Cu2O should be further considered in future. An efficient charge separation might be achieved on different crystal facets under photo-irradiation due to the difference in electronic structure, leading to the appearance of a new concept of a “surface heterojunction”.11,133 Based on the rule of charge separation, the selective deposition of desired cocatalysts on different crystal facets of Cu2O can be achieved by the reduction reaction with photogenerated electrons and the oxidation reaction with photogenerated holes, finally resulting in much higher activity compared with the photocatalyst decorated with random cocatalysts.185 Notably, the work functions of different Cu2O crystal facets and metals, the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valance band maximum (VBM) of Cu2O and decorated semiconductors should be considered seriously, which can determine the selection of compatible cocatalysts and the final performances. Pursuing this research direction will be useful to construct highly efficient solar energy conversion systems.

3. Hybrid Cu2O–metal oxide nanostructures and their applications
The controllable synthesis of semiconductor–metal oxide heterojunctions is an exciting direction to pursue for highly active photoelectric beacons, and also offers an opportunity to investigate the structure–property–performance relationship. Recently, considerable attention has been paid to construct high-activity hybrid Cu2O–metal oxide nanostructures with tunable interfaces for expanding their new applications.186–190
In this section, we will summarize the synthetic strategy and formation mechanism of different kinds of hybrid Cu2O–metal oxide nanostructures. Firstly, recent advances in the synthesis of Cu2O–ZnO heterogeneous nanostructures and their different applications (such as solar energy cell, photocatalyst and field emission) will be especially elaborated. After this, we will discuss the design and synthesis of Cu2O–TiO2 heterogeneous nanostructures for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting in detail. Then, we will introduce the synthetic strategies and principles of Cu2O–CuO heterogeneous nanostructures. In addition, other binary and ternary Cu2O–metal oxide heterogeneous nanostructures will also be mentioned. Finally, the synthesis and application of Cu2O–Cu2O p–n homogeneous nanostructures will be discussed. The applications of hybrid Cu2O–metal oxide nanostructures are summarized in Table 2.

3.1. Hybrid Cu2O–ZnO heterogeneous nanostructures
The design and fabrication of low-cost, efficient and reliable solar energy cells is a significant goal for solving the growing global energy demand and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.191 Metal oxide semiconductors are ideal for constructing thin film solar cells, which can offer excellent characteristics for fabricating a wide range of heterojunction based devices.192,193
Cu2O has attracted interest as a good candidate material for solar cells because of its abundant availability, nontoxicity and low production cost.194,195 It has a higher absorption coefficient in the visible region and the minority carrier diffusion length is also suitable for acting as a solar cell absorber layer.196 Zinc oxide (ZnO), as one of the most successful n-type semiconductors because of its wide band gap (3.37 eV), relatively large exciton binding energy (60 meV), deep level defect, high charge carrier mobility (∼120 cm2 V−1 s−1) and morphological diversity, has been widely investigated in solar cells, gas sensors and field emission devices.197–199 The two semiconductors have a particularly relative position of the energy band, of which the CBM of Cu2O is a little higher than the CBM of ZnO and the VBM of ZnO is lower than the VBM of Cu2O.200 This might promise that the p–n Cu2O–ZnO heterojunction has valuable applications in electrics and optoelectronics devices.
Recently, p-Cu2O/n-ZnO heterojunction solar cells have been pursued. Although the Shockley–Queisser theoretical value of the power conversion efficiency (PEC) of Cu2O-based solar cells is over 20%,201 the high recombination probability of photoinduced charge carriers and poor solar efficiency have hindered their practical application. So far, the highest PEC of reported p-Cu2O/n-ZnO-based devices (Al-doped ZnO/nondoped Ga2O3/Cu2O heterojunction) is about 5.83%.186 However, this efficiency is still much lower than the theoretical value. Therefore, further investigation devoted to this photo-adsorption Cu2O layer is imperative.
Actually, because of the intrinsic crystallographic limitations, such as lattice mismatch (a = 0.4267 nm for cubic Cu2O and a = b = 0.3254 nm, c = 0.5210 nm for hexagonal ZnO) and the relative instability of Cu2O, most of the Cu2O–ZnO heterojunctions were combined by electrodeposition, electrochemical deposition and sputtering methods, which impose restrictions on the heterojunction that can only exist in the form of films with a simple planar interface.202–204 It leads to an inadequate minority carrier transport length, a high recombination rate of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs and a low sunlight utilizing efficiency. For example, Katayama et al. prepared Cu2O–ZnO film heterostructure and measured a PCE of 0.117% under a simulated solar light of 120 mW cm−2.202 Jeong and coworkers have studied the influence of electrodeposition conditions such as pH value and temperature on the cell performance.205 However, in the two cases, the PCE was still low at about 0.1%. In 2010, Cui and Musselman et al. have fabricated Cu2O–ZnO film/nanopillar heterojunctions by electrodeposition methods, and the efficiency of such nanopillar solar cells was improved to above 0.5%.206,207 In comparison with planar Cu2O/ZnO film solar cells, the introduction of nanowire arrays can lead to higher efficiency and short-circuit current improvement because nanowires have a better charge carrier collection ability than films.208
Heterostructural p-Cu2O/n-ZnO nanowire arrays can be fabricated by the consecutive electrochemical deposition of an n-ZnO nanorod layer, followed by a p-Cu2O layer on a transparent conductive substrate. The performance of this heterojunction cell is able to achieve the PEC of 0.33% (see Fig. 10).187 Oxygen plasma can reduce the surface dangling bond and the density of defect sites of ZnO,209 resulting in an improved interface and a reduced charge recombination for higher device performance. Recently, Li and coworkers have also reported a high-performance Cu2O–ZnO nanowire heterojunction solar cell, fabricated solely by oxygen-plasma-assisted electrochemical deposition with the inclusion of Ga doping in aqueous solution. The use of electrochemically deposited ZnO powder-buffered Cu2O from a mixed Cu2+–ZnO powder solution and oxygen plasma treatment could reduce the density of defect sites in the interface to further increase PCE to 0.34%, leading to a little higher PEC among electrochemically fabricated Cu2O–ZnO nanowire solar cells.210

However, the open-circuit voltage of the above devices is significantly below the theoretical limit of Cu2O, because of a low built-in potential caused by non-ideal band alignment between the absorber (Cu2O) and transparent conducting oxide (TCO), and a high recombination-current driven by the rapid interfacial recombination.188,189
In order to further improve the open-circuit voltage, Buonassisi and coworkers have proposed to introduce a thin buffer layer between the absorber and the TCO.188,189 The buffer layer can act as an electron-blocking site, decreasing the recombination at the absorber–TCO interface. To date, some buffer layers have been introduced at the junction interface to offer ideal band alignment.186,188,189 For example, the introduction of an ultrathin non-toxic and scalable amorphous zinc tin oxide (a-ZTO) film (5 nm) as an electron-blocking layer can effectively inhibit charge recombination at the interface between the Cu2O absorber and the Al-doped ZnO TCO (see Fig. 11).188 The dark saturation current density reduces over an order of magnitude, and the open-circuit voltage improves to 0.553 V and PEC is 2.65%.188 Moreover, Buonassisi and coworkers have found that the presence of a deleterious CuO layer at the a-ZTO/Cu2O interface can be minimized by optimizing the a-ZTO atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, enhancing the heterojunction open-circuit voltage, and leading to an independently verified PCE of 2.85%.189 The introduction of an n-type Ga2O3 film can greatly enhance the performance of n-ZnO/p-Cu2O heterojunction solar cells. The PEC of 5.38% can be obtained in an Al-doped ZnO/Ga2O3/Cu2O heterojunction solar cell.186

Although the PEC demonstrated in Al-doped ZnO/Ga2O3/Cu2O heterojunction solar cells represents a good starting point for the realization of low-cost solar cells, the intrinsic property of the p-type Cu2O is easy to generate acceptor defects, particularly in the form of copper vacancies, which makes the Cu2O films with nanostructures have a high resistivity and low carrier mobility. Therefore, improvement of the conductivity of the Cu2O component is necessary. Importantly, the modification of the electronic structure of Cu2O to fully absorb visible light and improvement of the separation and transfer of photoexcited charge carriers in the interfaces of semiconductors are greatly necessary. Doping is a useful strategy for modifying the electronic structures of Cu2O, which could effectively improve their photovoltaic performances. A co-sputtering approach to dope Cu2O thin films might reduce the electrical resistivity and increase the photo-induced current simultaneously.190,210
The construction of heterojunctions is an exciting approach to obtain highly-active photocatalysts. Coupling ZnO nanostructures with Cu2O nanostructures can tune the response of the photocatalysis in the visible region and accelerate the charge separation, which affects the injection rate of photo-induced charge carriers and the final photocatalytic activity. Although a number of investigations on Cu2O–ZnO films have been reported as photovoltaic devices, the construction of Cu2O–ZnO heterostructures on a substrate towards the degradation of organic pollutants has been scarcely reported.
Recently, vertically aligned Cu2O–ZnO hetero-nanorod arrays were fabricated on indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates using a simple hydrothermal method followed by an electrodeposition process.211,212 As shown in Fig. 12a–f, a uniform distribution of Cu2O over the individual ZnO nanorod can be achieved. The increase of the electrodeposition time can enhance the photocatalytic activities of the system until the Cu2O nanoparticles nearly cover the entire periphery of the ZnO nanorods.211 The higher photocatalytic activities of the Cu2O–ZnO heterostructures can be possibly attributed to the improved optical absorption (Fig. 12g) and the specific 1D heterostructure (Fig. 12h).

The Cu2O–ZnO heterostructure could expand the absorption range within the sunlight spectrum due to the narrow band gap of Cu2O. As shown in Fig. 12g, the sunlight passing through the free space between the 1D nanorods may undergo multiple scatterings in the free space between the nanorods and the ITO substrate, leading to the improvement of the light absorbance. Furthermore, the formation of a favorable Cu2O–ZnO p–n junction promotes the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs under visible light irradiation and reduces the charge recombination.
As schematically shown in Fig. 12h, the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band (CB) of Cu2O can migrate into the CB of ZnO while the photogenerated holes migrate in the opposite direction from the valance band (VB) of ZnO to that of Cu2O. After the separation, the photogenerated electrons can very quickly come to the surface of the ZnO because of its one-dimensional and single crystalline nature, which favors the degradation of the dye. The positive holes in the VB can react with H2O species adsorbed on the catalyst surface, forming highly active ˙OH radicals in aqueous solution. The electron in the CB can transfer to oxygen adsorbed on the surface of the ZnO or Cu2O forming the HO2˙ superoxide radical, which oxidizes the adsorbed dye on the catalyst surface. Notably, when many Cu2O nanoparticles covered the surface of the ZnO nanorods, the effective surface of ZnO for photocatalytic degradation was eliminated; as a result, the photogenerated electrons derived from Cu2O cannot be depleted immediately and accumulate because of the poor electron mobility in nanocrystalline Cu2O, which accelerated the chances of charge recombination. Moreover, the small size and amount of Cu2O nanoparticles covered on the ZnO nanorods were in favor of the hole transfer and depletion; thus the photocorrosion of Cu2O was effectively prevented.211
From the above mentioned result, it can be found that 3D branched heterostructures composed of 1D building blocks can tremendously improve the optical absorption and limit the charge recombination to enhance the photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the increase of the overall aspect ratio will help to promote the field emission property.213 The heteronanobrushes composed of Cu2O nanoneedles decorated with ZnO nanorods can be synthesized by a two-step chemical method.213 The Cu2O nanoneedle was grown directly on the copper substrate by an electrodeposition and annealing method; subsequently, a seed-assisted growth of ZnO on Cu2O was carried out to achieve brush-like morphology by the pulsed laser deposition technique. A schematic of the growth procedure of Cu2O–ZnO hetero-nanobrushes is displayed in Fig. 13a–c. The formation of a Cu2O–ZnO p–n junction is a useful band alignment for the electron transport from the conduction band of the Cu2O core to the conduction band of the ZnO shell, which exhibits an enhanced field emission property (see Fig. 13d–f). The Cu2O–ZnO p–n heterojunction greatly reduces the recombination of electron–hole pairs. Large quantities of free electrons from Cu2O can easily move along the bend energy band or jump into the interfacial states and continuously inject into ZnO, and then emit to a vacuum, which shows that the increased emission sites of the Cu2O–ZnO nanobrushes are more than those of the Cu2O nanoneedles (see Fig. 13g).

So far, it has been less reported that normal hydrothermal methods can be developed for synthesizing Cu2O–ZnO heterojunctions. Recently, Yu and coworkers have reported a facile route for synthesizing ZnO decorated on different Cu2O microstructures by a low temperature hydrothermal and thermal annealing process with the assistance of polyethyleneimine.214 However, it still remains a challenge to develop a facile solution-phase strategy to synthesize uniform 3D branched Cu2O–ZnO heterostructures composed of 1D building blocks to improve their potential applications.
3.2. Hybrid Cu2O–TiO2 heterogeneous nanostructures
Sunlight-driven water splitting is a prospective research direction to meet the issue of worldwide energy demand. In a photoelectrochemical cell, photoexcitation of a p-type photocathode and an n-type photoanode provides electrons and holes, respectively, for water splitting. A previous report has demonstrated that Cu2O nanostructure is an ideal material component for efficient light harvesting.215 However, a major drawback of Cu2O as an electrode material is its short electron diffusion length (10–100 nm), and photo-instability in aqueous solution during illumination.216,217 In addition, the valence band position of Cu2O is slightly more positive than the potential for water oxidation, and coupling with an n-type semiconductor photoanode is therefore required for bias-free water splitting.29
Titanium dioxide (TiO2), as a typical n-type semiconductor, with excellent photo- and chemical stability, strong oxidizing activity, corrosion resistance and nontoxicity, can decompose water into oxygen and hydrogen without the application of an external voltage under certain conditions in the pioneering work of Fujishima and Honda four decades ago.218 Unfortunately, the common phases of TiO2 are wide band gaps (3.2 eV for the anatase phase and 3.0 eV for the rutile phase), which cannot be activated effectively under visible light radiation, and the photogenerated electron–hole pairs easily recombine.219 It has been demonstrated that narrow band-gap semiconductors can facilitate the electron transfer to large band-gap TiO2 in a narrow band-gap semiconductor/TiO2 heterostructure,220–224 thereby efficiently separating photogenerated charge carriers.225 Hence, the visible light absorption of TiO2 and the separation rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs are substantially enhanced.
A narrow band-gap (∼2.17 eV) p-type Cu2O semiconductor allows for visible light absorption, and conduction band electrons provide an approximately 0.7 V driving force for proton reduction.219 Both the conduction and the valence bands of Cu2O are located above those of TiO2.226 Thus, when TiO2 is coupling with Cu2O, the photogenerated electrons transfer from the conduction band of Cu2O to that of TiO2 to form the Ti3+ center,226 which prolongs the lifetime of photogenerated carriers. The merit of the Cu2O–TiO2 heterostructures can benefit from the attractive band gap of Cu2O as well as from the high stability of TiO2 in aqueous solutions.225,227–237 Sun and coworkers have developed a robust ultrasonication-assisted sequential chemical bath deposition technique to yield p-type Cu2O nanoparticles on n-type TiO2 nanotube arrays (see Fig. 14).225 The synthesized Cu2O–TiO2 heterojunction photoelectrode exhibited a more effective photoconversion capability than the TiO2 nanotube alone. Furthermore, the photoelectrode also possessed superior photoelectrocatalytic activity and stability towards the degradation of Rhodamine B.

Mesoporous TiO2 beads, produced by a metal–salt based hydrothermal process, can be successfully decorated with Cu2O nanoparticles by a simple chemical bath deposition process.231 The structural advantages of high specific surface areas, large pore volumes and suitable pore sizes of the TiO2 beads, in combination with the excellent charge separation realized through the decoration of band-structure-matched Cu2O nanoparticles, can achieve an ultra-high H2 evolution rate. Deng and coworkers have demonstrated that in situ loading of ultra-small Cu2O particles on TiO2 nanosheets can enhance the visible-light photoactivity.237 Other TiO2–Cu2O nanocomposites with increased visible light absorption and photocatalytic performance are also been investigated.238–240
Notably, Xiang and coworkers have investigated the stable structures of (TiO2)x(Cu2O)y solid–solutions with different compositions using a global optimization evolutionary algorithm, and examined their electronic properties using first-principles calculations.219 Their findings suggest that (TiO2)2(Cu2O) are suitable for visible-light-driven photoelectrochemical water splitting applications due to their good optical absorption as well as their suitable band edge potentials (see Fig. 15). The layered structure of (TiO2)2(Cu2O) is expected to lead to high stability in aqueous solutions.219 Therefore, a better understanding of the controls of (TiO2)x(Cu2O)y solid–solution on the nanometer scale would bring about a new capability to design necessary structures for expanding their potential applications.

Coupling polyhedral Cu2O with Co3O4 nanoparticles was most effective to avoid agglomerate formation of polyhedral Cu2O particles.241 Comparisons of the catalytic reactivity of Cu2O decorated with Co3O4 nanoparticles with different sizes and shapes for hydrogen evolution from ammonia borane hydrolysis suggested that the size of Co3O4 nanoparticles is more important than the shape to display a high catalytic reactivity. Similarly, the photoelectrochemical and photoelectrocatalytic mechanisms of n-type TiO2 nanoparticles decorated on a p-type Cu2O substrate need to be investigated.
3.3. Hybrid Cu2O–CuO heterogeneous nanostructures
Theoretically, Cu2O can be easily oxidized to form Cu2O@CuO core/shell structures in the oxygen condition due to the chemical valence of Cu(I).242 Moreover, CuO would be transformed into Cu2O by the reduction principle. Therefore, the controllable synthesis of CuO–Cu2O heterojunctions is imperative for expanding the potential applications of Cu2O crystals. As expected, hybrid Cu2O–CuO heterogeneous nanostructures with improved performances have also been reported.242–247
Recently, it has been demonstrated that solar photoelectron-synthesis of methanol can be driven by hybrid Cu2O–CuO semiconductor nanorod arrays for the first time.243 The Cu2O–CuO nanorod arrays were prepared on Cu substrates by a two-step approach consisting of the initial thermal growth of CuO nanorods followed by controlled electrodeposition of p-type Cu2O crystallites on their walls (see Fig. 16a). SEM images of thermally grown CuO nanorods before and after Cu2O electrodeposition on them for different reaction times are shown in Fig. 16b–e. Fig. 16f displays the hypothetical energy band diagram and mechanism of hybrid Cu2O–CuO nanorod arrays for solar photoelectrosynthesis of CH3OH from CO2. It can be seen that the VB edge of CuO is located at a more positive potential than the corresponding level in Cu2O in full agreement with the photocurrent–potential response of a hybrid Cu2O–CuO nanorod electrode, so the differences in the band edges of the two oxides facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the Cu2O shells to the CuO cores. Moreover, the photogenerated electrons in Cu2O are also able to be directly transferred to CO2 because the Cu2O shell is also in contact with the electrolyte. This double pathway for injection of photoelectrons into CO2 likely leads to an enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of a Cu2O–CuO nanorod array relative to a single Cu2O film.243

Moreover, highly stable and porous Cu2O–CuO cubes with enhanced gas sensing properties have been successfully synthesized by the calcination of the cupric oxalate and cubic Cu2O precursor at higher temperatures.244 Cu2O–CuO sub-microspheres assembled by smaller particles show good selectivity to H2S gas as well as good stability and repeatability, and can be easily prepared by a simple hydrothermal reduction method using Cu(CH3COO)2 as the precursor.245 Cu2O–CuO hollow polyhedra with porous shells were fabricated by thermal decomposition of the coordination compound [Cu3(btc)2]n (btc = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate) polyhedra (see Fig. 17a).246 When tested as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, these hollow polyhedra exhibited a reversible lithium storage capacity.

Notably, several approaches have been employed to synthesize hollow Cu2O cages by Oswald ripening or oxidation etching.73,80,85 Therefore, it is proposed that various Cu2O–CuO cages can be readily synthesized by partial oxidation of these morphologically hollow Cu2O cages. 2Cu2O + O2 + 4H2O → 4Cu(OH)2(8) Cu(OH)2 + 2OH− → [Cu(OH)4]2−(9) [Cu(OH)4]2− → CuO + 2OH− + H2O(10)
Typically, uniform Cu2O–CuO microframes have been prepared by an oxidation treatment of Cu2O microcubes under hydrothermal conditions (see Fig. 17b).247 The formation mechanism of the Cu2O–CuO microframes can be explained by the synergistic process of the Kirkendall effect and oxidation etching.49 Under hydrothermal conditions, the surface of Cu2O is firstly oxidized into divalent copper hydroxide (Cu(OH)2) in the presence of water and oxygen (see eqn (8)). However, the tetrahydroxo-cuprate(II) anion [Cu(OH)4]2− might have occurred from the copper hydroxide in a strongly basic environment (see eqn (9)), because of the Jahn–Teller stabilization in square-planar copper(II) complexes.248 Then thermodynamically stable CuO is produced and precipitated to yield solid particles by the decomposition of [Cu(OH)4]2− species (see eqn (10)). Thus CuO can be gradually precipitated on the inner wall of the hollow structure to form Cu2O–CuO frames. Hence, tailored synthesis of hollow Cu2O–CuO or pure CuO cages can be achieved.49,249
Moreover, the Cu2O–CuO heterogeneous structures show better catalytic activity towards catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO). The CO oxidation catalyzed by the CuO thin film restructured on different surfaces of Cu2O can involve different types of catalytically active sites, exhibiting different catalytic performances.242 Based on the anisotropic surfaces of Cu2O crystals, a broad range of novel hybrid Cu2O–CuO nanostructures with improved CO oxidation properties will be controllably designed and synthesized.
In addition to the above mentioned Cu2O–ZnO, Cu2O–TiO2 and Cu2O–CuO heterostructures, Cu2O–SnO,250 Cu2O–RuOx,251 Cu2O–CeO2,252 Cu2O–SiO2,253 and Cu2O–SrTiO3254 were also investigated. Improved performances of photocatalysts and sensors have been observed in these heterostructures.
Besides the binary systems, ternary composites with enhanced performances have also been synthesized.255–261 For example, magnetic Fe3O4@C@Cu2O with a bean-like core/shell nanostructure has been synthesized by a self-assembly approach (see Fig. 18a), and the bean-like core/shell nanocomposite exhibits universal and powerful visible-light-photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Rhodamine B, methyl orange, and alizarin red relative to commercial Cu2O.255 A multifunctional Fe3O4–Cu2O–polyaniline nanocomposite (see Fig. 18b) with room temperature superparamagnetism, an excellent absorption ability and superhydrophobic and lipophilic properties has been demonstrated.256 A stable, environmentally friendly and photomagnetic difunctional pine cone-like Fe3O4@Cu2O–Cu porous nanocomposite (see Fig. 18c and d) is also an ideal candidate in water treatment and environmental cleaning as well as in magnetic application.257 Moreover, investigations of CuO–Cu2O–Ni nanocapsules,258 Cu2O–CuO–TiO2 core/shell nanowire arrays,259 Cu–Cu2O–TiO2 catalyst,260 TiO2–Pt–Cu2O,261 and α-Fe2O3@SnO2@Cu2O heterostructures262 were also accomplished.

3.4. Hybrid Cu2O–Cu2O p–n homojunction
The improvement of photo-induced charge separation is the key for light-harvesting systems in both photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical solar cells, which can convert light energy into electrical power or chemical fuel. To enhance the charge separation efficiency, an effective method is to construct an appropriate junction structure within the semiconductors.
Typically, Cu2O is synthesized as a p-type semiconductor.263 In a p-type Cu2O based photodevice, copper rich regions are usually fabricated at the Cu2O/metal or Cu2O/n-type semiconductor heterojunction; thus the performances of these devices were governed by the p-Cu2O/Cu0 Schottky junctions.264 Especially, the construction of a p–n Cu2O homojunction may have a unique advantage because the formation of Cu0 is not expected at the p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O rectifying junction where p-Cu2O and n-Cu2O layers have comparable chemical reactivities. Therefore, developing a facile and practical approach to fabricate highly photoactive n-type Cu2O electrodes can be beneficial as it will allow for building solar cells or photoelectrochemical cells based on a p–n Cu2O homojunction, which is predicted to achieve a higher efficiency than heterojunction solar cells constructed with p-type Cu2O.264
Currently, a handful of cases to prepare n-type Cu2O have been reported.265–269 Thus it enables people to construct various p–n Cu2O homojunction photoelectrodes for efficient visible light conversion.270 To date, only several p–n Cu2O homojunctions have been synthesized.271–273 These p–n Cu2O homojunction films were generally produced by two consecutive electrochemical deposition steps on substrates.
A better understanding of the effect of interfacial electric field in p–n Cu2O homojunction is very important because the built-in electric field in a junction region can promote the photo-induced charge separation and facilitate the charge transport to produce a high quantum yield.271,272 Xie and coworkers have reported that p–n Cu2O homojunction films with controllable interfacial electric field were obtained by carefully adjusting the pH values of the electrolyte in each step of electrodeposition (see Fig. 19a–c).271 The photoelectrochemical and surface photovoltage measurements were used to investigate the behaviors of photo-induced charge carriers in different p–n Cu2O homojunction films (see Fig. 19d and e). The results demonstrated that the p–n Cu2O homojunction film can exhibit higher charge separation efficiency, leading to improved activity in photocatalytic reduction of methyl viologen (see Fig. 19f).

In order to better understand the Fermi levels of the electrochemically grown polycrystalline p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O layers and maximize the overall cell performance, the back and front contacts of the Cu2O homojunction cells were systematically investigated.273 Choi and coworkers have electrochemically fabricated p–n Cu2O homojunction solar cells by consecutively depositing an n-Cu2O layer on a p-Cu2O layer.273 The best cell assembled in this study achieved an efficiency of 1.06%, which is the highest efficiency reported to date for a Cu2O homojunction cell.274 However, the fabrication of a p–n Cu2O homojunction solar cell is still thought to be a way to reach the theoretical efficiency of 12%.194 With continuing studies on optimizing the Fermi levels and conductivities of both the electrodeposited p- and n-Cu2O layers, the optimum contacts to Cu2O layers can be achieved, so the improvement of the p–n Cu2O homojunction solar cells is likely possible. In future, the hybrid p–n Cu2O–Cu2O homojunction might be used as a component for synthesizing prospective multilayer heterostructures.
Although fascinating achievements in different types of hybrid Cu2O–metal oxide nanostructures have been reviewed above, some problems and challenges still exist and need to be solved.
(i) To remarkably improve the performance of a hybrid Cu2O-based device, the tailored synthesis of the Cu2O component with optimized size, morphology, dimension, crystal facet, and orientation is important. Although some “proof-of-concept” hybrid nanostructures were fabricated for studying the intrinsic properties of the devices, they are not possible for commercial applications. New integration technologies that can construct scalable and stable hybrid Cu2O–metal oxide nanostructures with good performances are still required.275
(ii) For the solar energy conversion, Cu2O has relatively high carrier concentration, but the charge mobility and electric conductivity of Cu2O are poor. Especially, the high recombination of photo-induced charges and the poor solar efficiency have hindered the practical application. Therefore, both the interfacial defect density and the charge-transfer channel need to be well modulated by rationally designing the structure of the hybrid system. Further efforts are required to improve these characteristics by developing a new growth route (e.g., selective doping of special chemical elements) and techniques for device design (e.g., the use of special metal/oxide contacts according to energy band theory, which generally involves ultrathin protective layers with strict thickness and composition on the Cu2O surfaces).
(iii) For the gas sensor and optoelectronic device applications, new technical approaches are necessary to directly grow uniform Cu2O aligned arrays onto flexible substrates with novel functionalities.
(iv) The electronic structures and surface/interfacial properties of hybrid Cu2O–metal oxide heterogeneous nanostructures are still not well-known. Therefore, more advanced theoretical investigations should be implemented urgently.
4. Hybrid Cu2O–carbon heterogeneous nanostructures and their applications
It is well-known that solar energy is the largest source to availably convert into electricity through the photoelectric effect for directly using or storing in batteries.276 Carbon nanomaterials (graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and fullerene (C60)) are being largely investigated as smart supports for solar-to-energy conversion applications, due to their outstanding thermal and chemical stabilities, high conductivities, and high specific surface areas.277 When composited with semiconductor materials, these carbon nanostructure supports act as good electron acceptors that can help improve charge separation within the semiconductors. As a result, the enhanced photocatalytic activities were achieved for semiconductor–carbon composites compared with the pristine semiconductor.278–287 So far, hybrid Cu2O–carbon nanostructure, as a promising composite, has attracted much attention because of the application in energy conversion, sensing, catalyst and cancer therapy. The synthesis pathways and applications of reported hybrid Cu2O–carbon nanostructures are summarized in Table 3.

In this section, we will summarize the reported strategies for controllable synthesis of Cu2O–carbon heterogeneous nanostructures. Firstly, recent advances in the synthesis of Cu2O–graphene heterogeneous nanostructures and their different applications will be especially elaborated. After this, we will discuss the design and synthesis of Cu2O–CNTs heterogeneous nanostructures. Finally, we will introduce the strategies which take advantage of different nanostructured carbon materials (such as carbon quantum dots, polypyrrole (PPy), carbon Vulcan XC-72 and C60) as building blocks to synthesize novel Cu2O–carbon heterogeneous nanostructures.
4.1. Hybrid Cu2O–graphene oxide heterogeneous nanostructures
Graphene, a monolayer of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, is an important material with a range of unusual properties, including high mobility of charge carriers,288 large specific surface area,289 and excellent mechanical strength.290 Recently, graphene is attractive as a nanoscale building block for the synthesis of high-performance graphene-based composites, and extensive efforts have been employed to investigate the growth of nanoparticles on the graphene surface.291,292 In most cases, graphene oxide (GO), a layered material with unique oxygen-containing structure produced by oxidizing graphite, was taken as a sheet precursor for graphene.293 The oxygen functional groups on the GO surface would affect the synthesis and distribution of the nanoparticles on GO sheets. However, less attention was paid to the relationship between the oxygen functional groups of GO and the surface structures of decorated nanoparticles.
Cu2O is one of the most prospective candidates for studying Bose–Einstein condensation of excitons,294,295 because of the spin-0 excitons in Cu2O. The electronic structure of Cu2O makes it a promising material with potential application in energy storage. The unusual electronic structures of both Cu2O and graphene inspired people to design and synthesize functional Cu2O-based graphene heterogeneous nanostructures.296

General synthetic strategy of hybrid Cu2O–rGO nanostructures. 
It has been demonstrated that the functional groups (hydroxyl and carboxyl groups) of GO can act as anchoring sites for the copper precursor. Recent studies have found that GO as a structural directing agent can be used to prepare unconventional polymeric matrices.297–299 Chen and co-workers have reported that the oxygen functional groups can induce the formation of Cu2O nanoparticles on the surface of reduced GO.293 This Cu2O-reduced GO (Cu2O–rGO) nanocomposite was prepared using different oxygenated GO by a wet-chemical method at low temperature. The formation of Cu2O–rGO is attributed to an interaction mechanism between Cu2+ cations and GO in aqueous solution. In a GO dispersion, Cu2+ ions tend to adsorb on the oxygen atom rich area of the GO sheet, leading to the formation of a high density of nanoparticles or even big microspheres at these sites after adding a precipitating agent. A schematic illustration of the synthetic pathway of Cu2O–rGO nanocomposites is shown in Fig. 20.293
 Fig. 20  A graphical illustration of the synthesis of the Cu2O–rGO nanocomposite. The GO sheets (a) were coordinated with Cu2+ cations (b), and then converted to Cu(OH)2 on GO (c), and then Cu2O–rGO was obtained (d).

A typical synthesis of Cu2O–rGO nanocomposites is as follows: the homogeneous suspension of exfoliated GO with sonication in water was prepared firstly (golden brown color, see Fig. 20a). Then, a blue copper(II) acetate monohydrate solution was added into the GO suspensions, resulting in a green aggregated mixture (see Fig. 20b). During this process, GO nanosheets have a strong interaction with Cu2+ ions as a result of their abundant oxygen functional groups, leading to the assembly of GO sheets into three-dimensional structure. Upon the addition of sodium hydroxide aqueous solution, the above mixture turned dark blue because of the formation of the blue Cu(OH)2 and the reduction of GO sheets at the same time (see Fig. 20c), as demonstrated in a previous report.300 Afterwards, when the aqueous solution was heated, the Cu2O nanoparticles were prepared from the reduction of Cu(OH)2 by glucose (reducer); meanwhile the rGO sheets were also formed from the reduction of GO by glucose, and a dark red solid was formed (see Fig. 20d). The reduction of GO and the deposition of Cu2O nanoparticles on rGO were carried out in one step. Finally, uniform Cu2O nanoparticles were spread on the surface of the rGO. The detailed chemical reactions that are involved in the growth of Cu2O–rGO heterostructures are suggested as follows: xGOa− + yCu2+ → (xGO − yCu)2y−ax(11) Cu2+ + 2OH− → Cu(OH)2(12) GO + OH− → rGO(13) GO + nCu(OH)2 + mGlucose → Cu2O–rGO(14)
Based on the above reaction mechanism, Cao and coworkers have successfully achieved ultra-small Cu2O nanoparticles monodispersely anchored on rGO.301 It can be found that the size of Cu2O nanoparticles on rGO is in the range of 5–8 nm as well as no aggregation of Cu2O nanoparticles. These Cu2O–rGO composites can afford high adsorption capacities for Rhodamine B and methylene blue. A reactive filtration film was assembled by the Cu2O–rGO composite, which can be applied to remove dye contaminants from waste water.
Furthermore, Tran and co-workers have reported that in situ growth and stabilization of Cu2O nanoparticles on graphene sheets are required to achieve a good p–n Cu2O–rGO junction, which can effectively improve the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation as well as the photostability of Cu2O.302 In this Cu2O–rGO composite, rGO acts as the electron acceptor to extract photogenerated electrons from Cu2O under visible light, leading to an enhanced charge separation within the Cu2O semiconductor, while limiting its self-photoreduction process. Hydrogen photogeneration activity and stability of the Cu2O–rGO composite in neutral aqueous solution were found to be significantly higher than those found for pristine Cu2O. However, both higher rGO and lower rGO content have less harvesting efficiency. Increasing rGO content resulted in light absorption competition for Cu2O, whereas decreasing rGO content caused agglomeration of Cu2O. Both phenomena caused a decrease in the light harvesting efficiency of Cu2O that translated into lower catalytic efficiencies. Therefore, to achieve the highest activity for light-to-hydrogen conversion, the content of rGO within the composite should be optimized.302
Similarly, ultra-small Cu2O nanoparticles dispersed on rGO can be achieved by reducing copper acetate supported on graphite oxide using diethylene glycol as both the solvent and the reducing agent.303 The whole reaction was described as follows: Cu2+ + DEG + GO + Hydrothermal → Cu2O–rGO(15)
Recently, a low-cost, fast, facile, green method, namely an ultrasound assisted approach, has been developed for the controlled synthesis of Cu2O–GO hybrid nanomaterials.304 The whole reaction was designed and carried out as follows: Cu2+ + Glucose + GO + Ultrasound → Cu2O–rGO(16)


Stable hybrid Cu2O–rGO nanostructures. 
Although promising as catalytic materials, the major drawbacks of Cu2O nanocrystals include the rapid shape distortion under harsh reaction conditions and poor stability in oxidizing environments. To overcome these drawbacks, a few synthetic strategies aimed at controlling the size, crystal facet and stability of Cu2O nanocrystals have been reported.
GO supported Cu2O nanocrystals can exhibit shape-selective activity and stability.305 For example, Ren and coworkers have reported a novel aqueous synthesis route for the shape-controlled Cu2O nanocrystals that involves the preparation of an aqueous solution containing CuCl2, SDS, NH2OH·HCl, GO, and NaOH (see Fig. 21a). The hybrid Cu2O–GO nanocomposites exhibit improved shape uniformity and better dispersion as is evident from the SEM images of both the rhombic 12-facet Cu2O architectures exposed to 12 {110} facets (see Fig. 21b) and cubic Cu2O architectures exposed to 6 {100} facets (see Fig. 21c).

In this growth process, the dual role of GO as a template and a surfactant is essential for the formation of dispersed Cu2O nanoparticles. As reported, the negatively charged surface hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the GO support facilitate their dispersion in aqueous solution, and favor binding with metal cations.303 The hydrolysis of the Cu2+ precursor results in the nucleation of the Cu(OH)2 precursor on the GO surface initially because of the strong electronic interaction between the cations and negatively charged functional groups. Upon the addition of the reactant NH2OH·HCl, the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ species occurred in the aqueous solution. As a result, the cubic Cu2O–GO nanocomposites were formed at relatively low concentration of NH2OH·HCl, while rhombic Cu2O–GO nanocomposites were formed at relatively high concentration of NH2OH·HCl. Moreover, the GO support significantly improves the catalytic activity and stability of the Cu2O nanocrystals. The hybrid Cu2O–GO composite shows superior shape-dependent catalytic activity for both the photocatalytic reaction and the aqueous phase conversion of biomass-derived glycerol to lactic acid.305 Additionally, by taking advantage of the large surface area and high electronic conductivity of GO306,307 and high electrocatalytic activity of Cu2O, the fabricated hybrid Cu2O–GO composite could exhibit excellent performance as enzyme-free amperometric sensors.308
According to the formation mechanism as shown in eqn (11)–(14), Chen and coworkers have synthesized stable Cu2O nanoparticles with the size of around 3 nm, which were uniformly and densely grown on functionalized graphene sheets (FGS).309 The distribution density of Cu2O nanoparticles can be easily controlled by FGS with different carbon and oxygen ratios (see Fig. 22a–c).309 Compared to bulk Cu2O, the as-synthesized Cu2O–FGS nanocomposite exhibits enhanced stability against oxidation under ambient atmosphere, which is attributed to not only the finite-size effect, but also the interfacial effect between Cu2O and FGS. Surfactant-free capped Cu2O nanoparticles grown on the FGS is in favor of providing more active sites for the adsorption of gaseous molecules, while the FGS can not only be used instead of the surfactant or ligand for the synthesis of two dimensional nanocomposites, but also it can be used as a conducting network for promoting the electron transfer. Therefore, stable Cu2O–FGS nanocomposites show fantastic sensitivity toward H2S at room temperature (see Fig. 22d).

3D hybrid Cu2O–rGO nanostructures. 
Quasi-two-dimensional structure of GO exposed to abundant functional groups offers dual molecule colloid properties,310 which elicits multivalent interaction with Cu2+ as well as polymer additive, both inducing and stabilizing the aggregation for subsequent particle-mediated crystallization.311
Inspired by this viewpoint, Fan and coworkers have prepared rGO-conjugated 3D Cu2O nanowire mesocrystals (see Fig. 23) using a one-pot hydrothermal treatment of copper(II) acetate in the presence of o-anisidine and GO.312 The obtained octahedral Cu2O mesocrystals possess high intracrystal porosities as a result of highly oriented interpenetrating nanowires with high aspect ratios as building blocks. The formation mechanism is proposed as follows: first, GO-promoted agglomeration of amorphous spherical Cu2O nanoparticles by means of particle-mediated aggregation under diffusion-limited conditions; second, the evolution of the amorphous microspheres into hierarchical structure, and finally to nanowire mesocrystals with a high degree of orientation by Ostwald ripening; third, large-scale self-organization of the mesocrystals and the reduction of GO (at high GO concentration) occur simultaneously, leading to an integrated hybrid architecture where porous three-dimensional framework structures are interspersed among two-dimensional rGO sheets. Owing to the high specific surface area and the enhanced conductivity, the Cu2O–rGO mesocrystal achieved a higher sensitivity toward NO2 at room temperature, surpassing the performance of stand-alone systems of Cu2O nanowire networks and rGO sheets. The Cu2O–rGO mesocrystals not only provide an excellent model to study the 3D self-organization of 1D functional semiconductor nanowire but also open up new possibilities for designing GO-based mesocrystals for various sensing applications.

Despite a number of reports focusing on the environmental and energy storage applications, so far little has been developed to explore the application of hybrid Cu2O–GO in biological systems. Wang and coworkers have synthesized and functionalized Cu2O–GO composites using biocompatible poly-(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) to render a novel water-dispersible hybrid for cancer therapy under both visible and near-infrared light in vitro.313 Experimentally, PSS-coated Cu2O–rGO composites were synthesized by the reduction of the GO aqueous dispersion in the presence of Cu(NO3)2, PSS, and hydrazine hydrate under reflux at high temperature. The average size of the Cu2O nanocrystals deposited on rGO sheets was about 4 nm. The material can be stable as a homogeneous suspension in biological solutions. Under near-infrared light irradiation, in vitro photothermal killing of both cancer and normal cells was demonstrated. Under visible light irradiation, it demonstrated in vitro selective photocatalytic killing of cancer cells. Hence, the PSS-coated Cu2O–rGO composites can be used as applicable cancer therapy agents.
Based on the above discussions, low-cost and facile-synthesized Cu2O nanomaterials, in conjunction with more efficient GO-templated synthetic strategies, hold great promise for the controlled synthesis of Cu2O–GO nanocomposites with potential applications in catalysts, sensors, cancer therapeutic agents as well as energy storage devices such as solar cells and lithium-ion batteries (see Table 3).

4.2. Hybrid Cu2O–CNTs heterogeneous nanostructures
Due to the unusual one-dimensional hollow tubular structure, high specific surface area, and special chemical and electronic properties, the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as supports for preparing nanosized catalysts is feasible.314 CNTs are largely inert, so the activation of their surfaces is essential. Thus it has motivated numerous investigations to improve metal nanoparticle dispersion on CNTs through functionalization of the carbon surface.315
The aromatic ring system of CNTs can be disrupted by the assistance of oxidation reagents including HNO3 or HNO3/H2SO4 mixture, thus the CNTs can be functionalized with groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl and carbonyl, which can act as anchoring sites for metal oxide nanoparticles and induce the impregnation of small and large particles.316,317 Moreover, the grafting of chemical functionalities on the CNT surfaces can impart negative charges, resulting in the creation of the electrostatic stability required for a colloidal dispersion, which will decrease the strong tendency to agglomerate because of their high surface energies.
As a result, the unique chemical and electrical properties of CNTs can be transferred to the CNT-based composites. It has been demonstrated that the physical and chemical properties of CNT deposited nanoparticles could be improved to obtain desired performances.316,317 Therefore, more and more investigations of CNTs have been focusing on depositing metal or metal oxide nanoparticles onto their surfaces to form high-activity CNT-based nanocomposites.
Copper oxide can exhibit an excellent performance in amperometric sensing,318–320 so it is expected that Cu2O–CNTs hybrid nanostructures will show a greater ability to promote electron-transfer and a large specific surface area, which can be potentially used to prepare high-performance amperometric sensors. Although there are several complex and high-cost methods for the synthesis of Cu2O/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanocomposites,321,322 the sensing properties of the as-prepared products are often limited because of the poor deposition of Cu2O nanoparticles on the MWCNTs surfaces. Therefore, it is highly desirable to achieve the synthesis of uniform Cu2O nanoparticles dispersed on the surface of MWCNTs.
Cu2O–MWCNT nanocomposites were successfully prepared in large quantities by a new fixture-reduction method under low temperature.323 The Cu2O–MWCNT modified electrode displays high electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of glucose. During this synthesis process, MWCNTs were chemically acidified by circumfluence agitation in a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid at first. Second, copper ions were fixed onto the surface of MWCNTs by chemical and physical adsorption. Third, the copper ions fixed on the surface of the MWCNTs were reduced by sodium sulfite. Finally, the Cu2O–MWCNT nanocomposites were synthesized. Furthermore, Zhang and coworkers have elucidated the growth mechanism of Cu2O–MWCNTs (see Fig. 24) synthesized by a spontaneous redox reaction.324 During this formation process, it has been found that defect densities of MWCNTs and pH value of the reaction system are crucial for the spontaneous redox, and high defect density is thermodynamically and dynamically favorable to the formation of Cu2O–MWCNTs. For spontaneous redox, Cu2O nanoparticles are located on the defect sites of MWCNTs, and a strong interaction is formed between defects and Cu2O, which could promote electron-transfer in the catalyst. So the Cu2O–MWCNTs nanocomposite shows a catalytic performance superior to that of the catalyst prepared by a hydrothermal method or other methods in the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane. However, the above mentioned methods involved harshly tangled MWCNTs, which might decrease the electrical conductivity and result in the poor sensitivity for glucose detection.

Huang and coworkers have successfully prepared a type of nanospindle-like Cu2O/straight multi-walled carbon nanotube (SMWNT) hybrid nanostructure by a precipitation method, which can exhibit an enzyme-free glucose sensor with high electrocatalytic activity and excellent reproducibility.325 In this hybrid system, SMWNTs act as the contributors for dispersing and connecting nanospindle-like Cu2O catalysts. Comparing with the tangled MWCNTs widely applied in nonenzymatic sensors, SMWNTs can be more easily dispersed in solution after mild sonication pretreatment because of the weaker van der Waals attraction force between the SMWNTs bundles, and keep a high electrical conductivity. Moreover, Cu2O nanospindles can be homogeneously distributed in the SMWNT conductive networks, which can fully contact with glucose, and amplifying the electrochemical signal for glucose determination. Thus the formation of an efficient conductive network between Cu2O nanospindles and SMWNTs can promote the electron transfer rate and improve the sensitivity of glucose detection. Hence, this nanocomposite combined the advantageous features of both SMWNTs and nanospindle-like Cu2O, and greatly improved the electrocatalytic properties of glucose detection. However, the size of nanospindle-like Cu2O is much larger, which will lose high electrical conductivity and high surface energy; thus the sensitivity for glucose detection is still difficult to be completely enhanced. Therefore, the unique dispersion of SMWNTs inspired us to design and synthesize ultra-small Cu2O–SMWNTs nanocomposites in the future.
4.3. Other hybrid Cu2O–carbon heterogeneous nanostructures
As a novel class of recently discovered carbon nanostructures, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) can exhibit promising photo-physical or chemical properties (photoinduced electron transfer and redox properties, luminescence and so on).326,327 Especially, the up-converted photoluminescence (PL) of CQDs offers the possibility to construct a CQD-based near infrared (NIR) and IR light (collectively called (N)IR) sensitive photocatalytic system. In light of its relatively narrow band gap, Cu2O was a potential candidate for designing the CQD-based (N)IR light sensitive photocatalyst.
Liu and coworkers have reported a one-step ultrasonic method for the fabrication of hybrid Cu2O–CQD composites (see Fig. 25a–h).328 When the Cu2O–CQD photocatalyst is illuminated (see Fig. 25i (1)), the protruding nanostructures allow multiple reflections of (N)IR light between the vacant spaces of these protruding particles, leading to a better use of the source light and therefore exhibit an enhanced photocatalytic performance.329 Furthermore, CQDs can absorb (N)IR light (>700 nm), and then emit shorter wavelength light (390–564 nm) as a result of up-conversion, which in turn further excites Cu2O to form electron/hole pairs (see Fig. 25i (2)). The electron–hole pairs can react with the adsorbed oxidants/reducers (usually O2/OH−) to generate active oxygen radicals, which subsequently results in the photodegradation of organic dye. Significantly, when CQDs are attached onto the surface of Cu2O semiconductors, the position of the CQD band edge permits the transfer of electrons from the Cu2O surfaces, leading to the charge separation and hindering the recombination of electron–hole pairs.330 Thus the electrons will be shuttled freely along the conducting network of CQDs, and the longer-lived holes on the Cu2O will account for the higher activity of the Cu2O–CQD composite photocatalyst. Therefore, the Cu2O–CQDs could use (N)IR light to enhance the photocatalytic activity based on the synergistic effect of the superior light reflecting ability of the Cu2O nanostructures and the up-converted PL property of CQDs.

Besides the above mentioned Cu2O–GO, Cu2O–CNT, and Cu2O–CQD nanocomposites, a few other Cu2O–carbon nanomaterials with special applications have been synthesized (see Fig. 26). For example, a hybrid Cu2O diode with orientation-controlled C60 polycrystal has been synthesized by a vacuum evaporation approach.331 Spontaneous self-assembly of Cu2O@PPy nanowires has been achieved by hydrothermal reduction of commercial CuO by pyrrole monomers in solution.332 Cu2O/carbon Vulcan XC-72 as a non-enzymatic sensor for glucose determination has been synthesized using NaBH4 as the reducing agent by an impregnation method.333 An efficient and reusable Cu2O–PPh3–TBAB system for the cross-couplings of aryl halides and heteroaryl halides with terminal alkynes has also been reported.334

As mentioned above, coupling Cu2O with different carbon nanostructures (such as CNTs, GO, and CQDs) can remarkably promote electron-transfer reactions to achieve the desired properties compared to the bare Cu2O components. The rapid emergence of various binary Cu2O–carbon heterogeneous nanostructures is expected to offer new opportunities to expand our understanding of the fundamental significance of Cu2O crystals as well as to enhance the potential applications of the Cu2O-based nanocomposites.
However, the intrinsic factors related to the kinetically controlled synthesis of well-morphological Cu2O with high-energy facets decorated on carbon substrates should be elucidated thoroughly, and the relationship between carbon–copper–oxygen interfacial structure and performance is unclear. Furthermore, the development of ternary or multiple Cu2O–carbon-based nanocomposites with multi-performances is still a challenge. Decorating Cu2O@metal/metal oxide on carbon substrates can reduce the damage to the Cu2O component during the chemical reactions, and further enhance the stability of the nanostructures. Especially, a unique Cu2O–metal–graphene stack has been demonstrated to harness charger flow for photocatalysis, which will open new windows to rationally design hybrid materials for solar energy conversion.335 In addition, other layered 2-D nanomaterials similar to graphene (such as boron nitride and molybdenum disulfide) decorated with Cu2O should be further investigated.
5. Summary and outlook
Hybrid Cu2O-based nanostructure has become a rapidly growing research field due to its significant contribution to both fundament study and multifunctional application. In this review, the synthesis strategies and the principles for enhancing performances have been demonstrated for different types of hybrid Cu2O-based nanostructures, including hybrid Cu2O–metal nanostructure (Cu@Cu2O, Au@Cu2O, Ag@Cu2O core/shell architecture and Cu, Au, Ag decorated Cu2O heterostructure), hybrid Cu2O–metal oxide nanostructure (including Cu2O–ZnO, Cu2O–TiO2, Cu2O–CuO heterojunction and Cu2O–Cu2O homojunction) and hybrid Cu2O–carbon nanostructure (including Cu2O–rGO, Cu2O–CNTs and Cu2O–CQDs). So far, novel hybrid Cu2O-based nanostructures with improved performances (such as solar cells, carbon monoxide oxidation, photocatalysts, field emission, sensors, templates and so on) have attracted much attention. Although significant progress has been made in the fabrication and application of various hybrid Cu2O-based nanostructures, several challenges and prospective research directions still remain to be addressed.
The rapid progress in nanoscience and nanotechnology has enabled the fabrication of hybrid Cu2O-based nanostructures with tunable characteristics. Actually, the rational design and sophisticated synthesis of morphological Cu2O-based nanostructure have been paid more attention. Various synthetic strategies have been employed to prepare hybrid Cu2O-based nanostructures with desired morphologies and even multidimensional interfaces to meet the specific requirements for practical applications. From this sense, the concept of “morphology-dependent nanostructure” provides a top priority for finely tuning the physiochemical performances. However, some promising research directions should be proposed. For example, polyhedral Cu2O nanostructures wholly exposed to high-energy surfaces could be introduced into the hybrid Cu2O-based heterogeneous architectures, especially for the hybrid metal@Cu2O core/shell and metal nanoparticles decorated Cu2O heterojunctions. Furthermore, much attention should be paid to synthesize hybrid Cu2O-based nanostructures with highly uniform one-dimensional or two-dimensional Cu2O building blocks.
The application of hybrid Cu2O-based templates for synthesizing multicomponent heterostructures or hollow cages should be further considered. Previously, we have demonstrated that Cu2O-templated growth of definable nanostructures is of special interest from both theoretical and practical perspectives, and different hollow cages, including metal, metal oxide and copper sulfide, can be selectively designed and synthesized.56 Inspired by this Cu2O-templated strategy, hybrid Cu2O-based templates can also be expanded to synthesize a broad range of new binary and ternary Cu2O-based heterostructures. It can be confidently anticipated that new M–Cu2O–metal, M–Cu2O–metal oxide and M–Cu2O–carbon (M = sulphide, selenide, metal oxide, and metal) heterogeneous nanostructures will be successfully synthesized through Cu2O–metal, Cu2O–metal oxide and Cu2O–carbon heterogeneous templates, respectively. Subsequently, the novel multi-walled or multi-compositional hollow york/shell nanostructures can be obtained after removing the Cu2O components.
Significantly, in-depth investigations of the electronic structures and interfacial properties of hybrid Cu2O-based nanostructures could help us to rationally design and synthesize functional Cu2O-based nanocomposites with exceptional performances. However, some future research directions towards the modification of the electronic structures and interfacial properties of hybrid Cu2O-based nanostructures should be highlighted.
(i) The illumination of the facet-dependent surface/interface properties to substantially promote the performances is a significant task, and the concept of “surface heterojunction” should be further applied in the design and fabrication of novel heterojunctions. Moreover, we would like to emphasize that more advanced theoretical investigations and experimental studies on the electronic structures and interfacial properties of hybrid Cu2O-based nanostructures should be conducted to offer a better understanding of the structure-related properties and to further develop the interface-dependent applications.
(ii) Selected-doping and selected-heterostructuring on specific facets of Cu2O are very meaningful to improve the electronic conductivity and charge separation for enhancing the photochemical performances, which would also bring about a new capability to design necessary structures for potential applications. Especially, the work functions of metal and different crystal facets of Cu2O, and the conduction band minimum and the valance band maximum of Cu2O and decorated semiconductors should be considered, which directly determines the appropriate selection of compatible cocatalysts for charge separation.
(iii) Rational design and selection of ultrathin protective layers with strict thickness and composition on the Cu2O surfaces should be taken seriously, which can effectively enhance the structural stability of the nanocomposite. Moreover, the surface restructuring of Cu2O to in situ form new CuO or Cu thin films during oxidation or reduction conditions should be considered for optimizing the Cu2O-based energy conversion systems.
(iv) With regard to the Cu2O component in a hybrid system, the synthesis of low-cost, uniform-size, well-shaped, well-dispersed, and high-purity nanoparticles still remains an obstacle. Therefore, attention should be paid to the exploration of new synthetic routes to prepare the desired Cu2O nanoparticles on a design substrate.
Overall, the investigation of hybrid Cu2O-based nanocomposites with tailored features offers a meritorious platform for uncovering the structure–property–performance relationship and accelerating the practical applications. Given the continuous development of the growth and synthesis techniques, more novel hybrid Cu2O-based nanostructures with interesting properties and promising applications will be achieved in the near future.
