    , Accepted 8th September 2016First published on 9th September 2016AbstractWe report new types of TiO2@CdS and TiO2@ZnS binary structures fabricated by decorating TiO2 surfaces with CdS or ZnS nanoparticles. The material characterization shows that the presence of CdS on the TiO2 surface results in a red-shift of the material band edge in the visible region compared to pure TiO2. A further enhancement of visible light was achieved by N719 dye loading on TiO2@CdS. The binary structure electrode with TiO2@ZnS-4 extended the absorption edge to the visible region and was used as an efficient photo-anode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The experimental results indicate that replacing Ti2+ with Zn2+ ions on the surface greatly increases the surface stability compared to TiO2. Furthermore, Zn and S impurities have a drastic impact on the host material and can create new energy states that can delay the exciton recombination and allow charge separation. The DSSCs based on the TiO2@ZnS-4 photo-anode achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.91% under one sun light illumination, which is higher than those of bare TiO2 (2.84%) and TiO2@CdS-4 (1.44%). This work demonstrates a promising way to design efficient photo-anodes for use in DSSCs that can achieve a high PCE with a lower recombination rate during electron transportation.
1. Introduction
In the past decade, hydrogen fuel has gained much attention in scientific research and for industrial applications as a promising clean energy source and an alternative opposed to conventional fossil fuels.1 Photocatalytic H2 evolution over inorganic semiconductors under visible-light has been attracting more and more attention and has been explored for solar fuel production.2–4 The degradation of pollutants through semiconductor-based photocatalysts has been noted for desirable properties that can be used to solve environmental problems.5,6 In recent years, many semiconducting photocatalysts have been developed, such as TiO2, ZnO, CdS, CdSe, ZnS, and ZnTe.7,8
Among various photocatalysts, the n-type semiconductor TiO2 has been extensively studied as a standard photocatalyst due to its effective decomposition of organic compounds in air and water under UV light irradiation. Anatase and rutile TiO2 are both constructed from octahedral building blocks. However, differences in the octahedral arrangement result in distinct behavior of each polymorph. Compared to rutile TiO2, anatase TiO2 can efficiently separate photoexcited charge carriers in photocatalytic applications.9,10 TiO2 has received immense attention in the photocatalytic field due to its versatile and advantageous properties such as low cost, easy preparation, nontoxicity, high chemical stability, and corrosion resistance. However, the wide band gap energy of anatase TiO2 (Eg = 3.2 eV) restricts the use of visible light in the solar spectrum and limits the photo-efficiency, activity, and high recombination rate of the photo-generated electron/hole pairs. A major problem is that only about 3 to 4% of the solar spectrum reaching the earth's surface is in the UV-range.11 Therefore, finding an effective way to harvest visible light remains a great challenge.
In recent studies the bandgap of TiO2 was reduced so that it coincides with the visible spectrum. The strategies used have involved ion implantation, metal loading, doping, and use of composite semiconductors.12–14 Unfortunately, reducing the bandgap of TiO2 is generally difficult and needs a multi-step experimental process. A range of strategies have been developed to improve the visible light absorption of the TiO2 photocatalyst, including combining a wide-band gap photocatalyst with smaller-band gap semiconductors (such as metal chalcogenides) and doping with metals and non-metals. These approaches lead to high photocatalytic efficiency for H2 generation.15,16 Combining photo-catalysts with semiconductors can broaden the absorption region and reduce the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs.17,18 By coupling with semiconductors, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 is expected to be largely enhanced by extending the absorption cross-section, enhancing the charge separation, and inhibiting the charge–carrier recombination. Several methods for fabricating coupled semiconductors have been published, including MS/TiO2 (M = Pb, Cd, Zn) nanoparticles for heterogeneous photocatalytic applications, which also exhibit better optical properties compared with the corresponding bulk material due to quantum confinement effects.19
A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) consists of a monolayer of a photo-sensitizing dye adsorbed onto a mesoporous film of TiO2, a Pt thin film counter-electrode (CE) and an electrolyte, typically an I−/I3− redox couple.20,21 Under illumination of solar light, the dye molecules are excited and electrons are injected into the conduction band of the semiconductor. To generate higher electrical energy from DSSCs, the electrons excited by photons need to travel through four interfaces: the DSSC:N719 dye/nanocrystalline oxide semiconductor, semiconductor/fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, I−/I3− electrolyte/CE, and N719 dye/electrolyte.22 However, some factors limit the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of such devices: among them the greater recombination between the photo-anode and the electrolyte is one of the most important. Recently, many researchers have paid attention to the interface of FTO/TiO2 and concluded that several metal sulfide materials have been widely used as a compact layer between the TiO2 and the dye to suppress the recombination reaction.23,24 The deposition of a compact layer between FTO/TiO2 and dye has been proven practically and theoretically as an efficient method to block the electron recombination via the indirect route.25 However, the compact layer should be denser than TiO2 because there are numerous empty spaces between the colloidal particles where the FTO substrate comes into direct contact with the electrolyte. Therefore, it can efficiently minimize the contact surface area for FTO sites and the I−/I3− redox electrolyte. Michele et al. fabricated a thin anatase titanium dioxide compact layer by electron beam evaporation as a buffer layer in DSSCs.26 Hua Yu et al. synthesized a TiO2 organic sol under very mild reaction conditions as a compact layer, which is simple and of low-cost.27
Among various materials, small-bandgap CdS (Eg = 2.4 eV) and ZnS are excellent candidates because of their effective separation of electron–hole pairs and band-edge levels that are capable of driving both the oxidation and reduction of water under visible light irradiation.28,29 In particular, ZnS has been extensively studied; it is more environment friendly and more abundant.30 Photocatalytically active TiO2@ZnS and TiO2@CdS composites can show better photostability and activity than their individual components.31–33 For example, Jun et al. synthesized TiO2–CdS composite photocatalysts with a remarkable photocatalytic H2-generation rate under visible-light irradiation.28 Jiangtian et al. prepared CdS@TiO2 heterostructures with an enhanced absorption edge and photoelectrochemical response in the visible region.34 Srinivasa Rao et al. synthesized a TiO2/ZnS photo-anode on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), which accumulated a large number of photo-injected electrons in the conduction band with a lower recombination rate compared with bare TiO2.30 Franco et al. synthesized a distinct nanocrystalline TiO2-capped ZnS using a chemical vapor deposition method.35 TiO2-capped ZnS increases the catalytic photoactivity compared with bare TiO2.
In this study, TiO2@ZnS and TiO2@CdS were developed via two simple methods: the doctor-blade method and the successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique. The heterostructures build up a transfer path for visible-light-excited electrons from CdS to the TiO2 nanoparticles. The presence of ZnS on the TiO2 nanoparticles can effectively reduce the interfacial recombination. As a result, visible light absorption and the separation rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs were significantly improved. TiO2@ZnS and TiO2@CdS were used as photo-anodes in DSSCs with NiS as a CE. The cell (TiO2@ZnS-4) achieved an enhanced conversion efficiency of 4.91% compared to bare TiO2 (2.84%) due to improved short-circuit current density (12.60 mA cm−2) under one sun illumination.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of TiO2 nanoparticles
All chemicals used for the preparation of ZnS, CdS, and NiS were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification unless mentioned. TiO2 nanoparticles were directly deposited on substrates of FTO (1.3 × 1.6 cm2, 13 Ω sq−1 resistance) by a previously reported doctor-blade method.36 Prior to TiO2 nanoparticle deposition, the FTO substrates were cleaned with acetone/ethanol for 15 min each using an ultrasonic bath and then with deionized water (DI) for 15 min. The FTO substrates were dried with nitrogen gas to remove any residual organic substances. The TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared using commercially available TiO2 paste with a particle size of 20 nm (Ti-nanoxide HT/SP, Solaronix). The TiO2 paste was spread on the FTO by the doctor-blade method and then sintered at 450 °C for 30 min to remove organic substances and improve the adhesion between the FTO and TiO2 nanoparticles.
2.2 Fabrication of TiO2@ZnS heterostructures
ZnS nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles via the SILAR method. The prepared TiO2 films were dipped into 0.2 M Zn(NO3)2 for 5 min to allow Zn2+ ions to adsorb onto the TiO2 film. They were then washed with DI water and ethanol for 1 min each to remove the excess Zn2+ ions. The films were then dipped into 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution to react S2− ions with pre-adsorbed Zn2+ ions to form ZnS. This entire dipping process was considered as one SILAR cycle, which was repeated 1 to 5 times to achieve good adsorption over the TiO2 film. Samples with different ZnS loadings were named according to the number of SILAR cycles (TiO2@ZnS-1, TiO2@ZnS-2, TiO2@ZnS-3, TiO2@ ZnS-4, and TiO2@ZnS-5).
2.3 Fabrication of TiO2@CdS heterostructures
Under all preparation conditions, FTO was used as the substrate to deposit ZnS or CdS over TiO2 due to its excellent electrical conductivity and resistance to the corrosive electrolyte. CdS quantum dots (QDs) were deposited on the surface of TiO2 films via the SILAR method. Cd and S precursor solutions were prepared separately by dissolving 0.1 M Cd(NO3)2 and 0.1 M Na2S in 30 mL DI water. TiO2 films were immersed in Cd(NO3)2 solution for 5 min to allow Cd2+ ions to cover the TiO2. They were then immersed in an aqueous solution of Na2S for 5 min, in which Cd2+ ions reacted with S2− ions to form CdS. This was followed by rinsing with DI water and ethanol to remove excess Cd2+ or S2− ions. The CdS QD loading was controlled by varying the number of SILAR cycles to ensure complete diffusion of the precursor into the voids among TiO2 nanoparticles. After each SILAR cycle, the samples were immediately dried using a hair dryer. The CdS QDs were deposited on TiO2 films in 1 to 5 SILAR cycles and are denoted as TiO2@CdS-1, TiO2@CdS-2, TiO2@CdS-3, TiO2@CdS-4, and TiO2@CdS-5, respectively.
2.4 Preparation of the NiS counter-electrode
NiS particles were deposited on the FTO substrate via the CBD technique. The CBD method is a simple, low-cost, and easy method for preparing the metal sulfide CE on the FTO substrate. Cleaned FTO substrates were horizontally dipped in an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M nickel sulfate hexahydrate, 0.4 M thioacetamide, 0.6 M acetic acid, and 0.8 M urea. In this preparation process, nickel sulfate hexahydrate and thioacetamide act as Ni2+ cation and S2− anion sources. The role of the urea is to increase the hydrolysis rate of the prepared solution and the rate of thioacetamide decomposition. The FTO substrates were placed in this aqueous solution and kept in an oven at 90 °C for 90 min. After the deposition time, the samples were immediately washed several times with DI water/ethanol and used for further analysis.
2.5 Material characterization techniques and measurements
The phase composition of the as-prepared samples was explored using X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/Max-2400, Rigaku) at 40 kV and 30 mA in the 2θ range of 20–80°. The surface features and morphology of the samples were examined using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; SU-70, Hitachi) and a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, Jem 2011, Jeol cop) at the Busan center KBSI. The elemental compositions of TiO2, ZnS, and CdS were identified by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 using monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV). The optical properties were investigated by optical absorption (OPTIZEN 3220 UV spectrophotometer). The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were investigated using an ABET Technologies (USA) solar simulator (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G) under one sun illumination. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also done using a Biologic potentiostat/galvanostat/EIS analyzer (SP-150, France) under one sun illumination. The frequency ranged from 100 mHz to 500 kHz.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Surface decoration of TiO2 nanoparticles with CdS QDs or ZnS
ZnS and CdS nanoparticles were deposited on TiO2 surfaces to enhance the specific surface area and adhesion between the FTO substrate and films. The particle size and morphology of the bare TiO2, TiO2@ZnS-3, TiO2@ZnS-4, TiO2@CdS-4, and TiO2@CdS-5 photocatalysts were measured by SEM. ZnS and CdS QDs were deposited on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles via SILAR, which changed the color of the samples from white to thick white and from white to yellow, indicating the presence of ZnS and CdS phases on the surface and these images were recorded as shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1).

Fig. 1d and e (TiO2@ZnS-3, TiO2@ZnS-4) show that the ZnS nanoparticles have a smooth surface with uniform particle distribution. The SEM images of the TiO2@CdS-4 and TiO2@CdS-5 samples are shown in Fig. 1b and c. The size of the gaps between the nanoparticles (Fig. 1d and e) was decreased by increasing the number of SILAR cycles from 3 to 4, which decreased the recombination rate, leading to increased photovoltaic efficiency. We can conclude that the crystal morphology of the film changes according to the reaction conditions, such as the reaction time, the number of SILAR cycles, additives, and pH. To investigate the morphology of the as-prepared TiO2@CdS-1, TiO2@CdS-2, TiO2@CdS-3, TiO2@ZnS-1, and TiO2@ZnS-2 on FTO substrates, SEM images were recorded as shown in the ESI† (Fig. S2).
 Fig. 1  SEM images of the films of (a) bare TiO2, (b) TiO2@CdS-4, (c) TiO2@CdS-5, (d) TiO2@ZnS-3, and (e) TiO2@ZnS-4. 
From the SEM images, the formation of structures was not identified clearly because the layers were too thin to be detected and the lower magnification in the SEM. Fig. 2 shows the TEM images of the bare TiO2, TiO2@CdS-4 and TiO2@ZnS-4 nanoparticles. The diameter of bare TiO2, TiO2@CdS-4 and TiO2@ZnS-4 was estimated to be ∼25 nm, which is in accordance with the SEM results. The average diameter of these particles was predictable from amplifications of TEM images by considering every particle and averaging the measurements. One can see that the ZnS or CdS nanoparticles are well dispersed on the TiO2 surface with good contact between the particles, which show a uniform particle size by the facile SILAR technique. On the basis of TEM results, it is proposed that a photo-anode with a uniform particle size and good contact between the particles will adsorb more dyes due to a larger adsorption area.37 Moreover, these results indicate that the cell performance could be enhanced due to efficient particle-to-particle transport of electrons.38,39

The crystal structures of the synthesized materials were analyzed using the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 3. The patterns indicate an anatase structure without any new phase. The resulting XRD peaks at 25.28°, 37.80°, 48.05°, and 76.02° were assigned to the [1 0 1], [0 0 4], [2 0 0], and [3 0 1] crystal planes, respectively, which matched well with JCPDS PDF no. 21-1272. Only one diffraction peak of ZnS is observed at 2θ = 28.87°, which corresponded to the [1 0 3] crystal plane (JCPDS, PDF no. 00-039-1363) in Fig. 3. This could be because of the very low Zn and S content on the TiO2 surface (see Table S1 in the ESI†). XRD spectroscopy clearly detects and confirms the presence of TiO2 on FTO substrates, whereas the CdS and ZnS peaks are not detected in the XRD pattern, which indicates that the structure of TiO2 is not affected by the incorporation of CdS or ZnS nanoparticles.

The size of the nanoparticles was calculated using the Debye–Scherrer formula (1): D = 0.91τ/βcosθ(1)where τ is the wavelength of X-ray diffraction and β is the full width at half maximum of the peak diffraction angle θ. The average nanoparticle size was estimated to be approximately ∼25 nm for bare TiO2 and ZnS-decorated TiO2 films, which was calculated from the prominent [0 0 4] diffracted peak. The nanoparticle size from the Debye–Scherrer formula is in good agreement with that observed in SEM and TEM images.
EDX analysis was done to investigate the elemental compositions of the bare TiO2 and TiO@CdS- and TiO2@ZnS-based electrodes on FTO substrates. The EDX spectra are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S3 and S4). The elemental compositions (Ti, O, Cd, Zn, and S) were calculated using the spectra and are shown in Table S1 in the ESI.† The bare TiO2 film shows a Ti/O atomic ratio of 33.8/66.1 with no external peaks. The atomic percentage of Ti and O decreased when the CdS and ZnS films were coated onto the TiO2 surface by the SILAR method. The formation of CdS was confirmed, and the formation of sulfur ions was faster than that of cadmium ions. The deposition of ZnS on TiO2 films was also confirmed, and interestingly, the atomic percentages of Zn and S were approximately equivalent (Zn:S = 1:1). The EDX results confirmed the formation of TiO2, CdS, and ZnS on the FTO substrates without any additional impurities.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were further conducted to better understand the chemical bond configuration and composition of the as-prepared TiO2@CdS-4 and TiO2@ZnS-4 with the resulting XPS spectrograms shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4a we observed only Ti, O, Cd and S elemental peaks on the surface of the FTO, indicating that the prepared TiO2@CdS-4 electrode is relatively pure. Fig. 4b and c shows the high-resolution spectra of Cd3d and Ti2p. The XPS spectrum of TiO2@CdS-4 for Ti2p in Fig. 4c presents two major peaks with binding energies of 458.4 and 465 eV, which correspond to the Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 of the Ti2p phase, respectively.40,41Fig. 4b shows the typical XPS survey spectra of Cd3d of the Cd phase. The binding energy peaks of Cd3d are observed at 406.2 and 413.8 eV, respectively.42–44 Moreover, the presence of TiO2 and CdS on the FTO substrate is shown in Fig. 4a. This shows good agreement, indicating the presence of Ti, O, Cd and S in TiO2@CdS-4 electrodes. The XPS clearly identifies and confirms the presence of Cd and S, whereas the CdS peak is not identified in the XRD pattern, which indicates that the structure of TiO2 is not affected by the trace amount of Cd and S content in the sample. Fig. 4e shows the XPS spectrum of the TiO2@ZnS-4 electrode. The resulting XPS peaks of Ti2p3/2, Ti2p1/2, Zn2p3/2, and Zn2p1/2 are located with binding energies of 458, 465.8, 1024, and 1045.6 eV. High-resolution spectra of O1s for TiO2@CdS-4 and TiO2@ZnS-4 electrodes are clearly explained in the ESI† and shown in Fig. S5, ESI.† The XPS results confirmed the formation of CdS or ZnS on the TiO2 surface without any additional peaks.

3.2 Optical absorption studies
The light absorption properties of each of the electrodes of bare TiO2 and CdS- or ZnS-decorated TiO2 were assessed by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 5a and b). For the bare TiO2 electrode, a steep absorption edge occurred around 360 to 370 nm corresponding to the 3.3 to 3.4 eV band-gap of anatase. This originated from the charge transfer that occurred from O2p to Ti3d.29
 Fig. 5  Absorption spectra of electrodes made of bare TiO2, and CdS or ZnS decorated on TiO2: (a and b) before dye loading and (c and d) after dye loading. 
By varying the CdS QD loading on the TiO2 surface (Fig. 5a), the spectral curve was extended to the visible light region, and different absorption edges were realized in the visible region with a red shift (absorption edge above 400 nm for TiO2@CdS films). This absorption band red-shifts with higher loading of CdS nanoparticles, which might be due to the aggregation of the CdS nanoparticles into larger domains.28 Based on this, we expected the resulting composite-coupled semiconductor to increase photogenerated charge carriers under visible light irradiation.
In the case of ZnS-decorated TiO2, the spectral curve does not display any appreciable deviation, but the absorption edge of the TiO2@ZnS-5 film absorption peak is a little bit higher (375 nm) than that of bare TiO2 (360 to 370 nm). Compared to TiO2@ZnS, using TiO2@CdS results in a substantial red-shift in the absorption onset of TiO2 and enhanced absorption in the visible light region. This indicates an interfacial interaction between the TiO2 and CdS nanoparticles. Therefore, compared to bare TiO2 and TiO2@ZnS, TiO2@CdS-based photocatalysts are expected to have better visible-light-driven photocatalytic abilities (before dye loading). The UV-vis absorption behavior observed in the present study directly indicates that the CdS nanoparticles greatly hook up with TiO2 by the SILAR method and without the loss of anchored N719 dyes, leading to the enhancement in photo-current density.45 From the absorption spectra of Fig. 5a and b, it is detected that the deposition of CdS or ZnS layers on TiO2 increases the large portions of the visible spectrum. This improved absorption in the visible wavelength region results in the generation of abundant electron–hole pairs in the TiO2@CdS and TiO2@ZnS based composite under UV-visible illumination, which can lead to greater photocatalytic activity and photo-current.46
To use the bare TiO2, TiO2@CdS, and TiO2@ZnS films as photo-anodes in DSSCs, they were immersed in the commercially available N719 dye for 20 h at room temperature after drying using a hair dryer.47 In photovoltaic cells, the sensitizer plays a crucial role and is solely responsible for the electric current generation by harvesting solar light and injecting electrons into the conduction band of TiO2.48 The sensitized photo-anodes revealed two absorption edges (Fig. 5c and d), which means that the photo-anodes contain two types of semiconductors (CdS on TiO2 and ZnS on TiO2). After the N719 dye covered the TiO2@ZnS film, better visible light absorbance was observed and the peaks were broadened compared to bare TiO2 (due to adsorbed dye molecules). The short-circuit current density (Jsc) was significantly increased for the TiO2@ZnS films than for the bare TiO2 and TiO2@CdS due to improved dye loading.49 In the case of TiO2@CdS (Fig. 5c), the CdS nanoparticles on TiO2 do not display any appreciable enhancement. Over the entire process (CdS-1 to CdS-5 on TiO2), the UV-absorption peak gradually decreases and at the same time the wavelength range shifts to slightly lower values because of the detachment or loss of dyes on the CdS surface.
3.3 Photoelectrochemical properties
EIS was used to study the electrochemical characteristics of the counter-electrode, photo-anode, and chemical capacitance of the electrolyte.50 The Nyquist plots of DSSCs with bare TiO2, TiO2@CdS-1, and TiO2@ZnS-4 photo-anodes were measured under a simulated light source and a bias potential of 0.6 V. The amplitude was kept at 10 mV in all cases. The plots were analyzed using Z-view software. The equivalent circuit comprises a series resistance (Rs), which is the combined resistance of the electrolyte and the electrode. The resistances RCE, Rct, and Zw correspond to the electron transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface, the charge transfer resistance at the photo-anode/electrolyte interface, and the Warburg diffusion process of I−/I3− ions in the electrolyte in the low-frequency region, respectively. The resistance of the composite film photo-anode is reflected by Rct (from the second semicircle in the low frequency region). The catalytic capability of the NiS film CE is reflected by RCE (from the first semi-circle at high frequencies). EIS is useful for characterizing electronic and ionic transport processes in DSSCs and QDSSCs. The value of Rct at the photo-anode/electrolyte interface is the main factor for determining the fill factor (FF) of DSSCs.51,52 The equivalent circuit model and the electrochemical parameters of the DSSCs are shown in Fig. 6a and Table 1. The RCE values are similar for the bare TiO2, TiO2@CdS-1, and TiO2@ZnS-4 photo-anodes.

Fig. 6b shows that the diameter of the lower frequency semicircle decreases with deposition of the CdS layer on TiO2. The Rct value of DSSCs with bare TiO2 (8.75 Ω) is higher than that of TiO2@CdS-1 (8.51 Ω) as estimated from the diameters of the arcs. The Rct value of DSSCs sensitized with bare TiO2 can be enhanced more efficiently than that of the DSSC fabricated using CdS QDs on a TiO2 surface. The bare TiO2 and TiO2@CdS electrodes had different elemental compositions and morphologies, as a result, their Rct values were different. Interestingly, TiO2@ZnS-4 shows that the diameter of the lower frequency semi-circle increased with the deposition of ZnS nanoparticles on the TiO2 surface. The TiO2@ZnS-4 electrode shows a significant difference compared with TiO2@CdS-1 with a larger diameter of the lower frequency semicircles compared with other electrodes. This suggests that the minimal ZnS particles on the surface of TiO2 can significantly increase the electronic and ionic transport processes in DSSCs.30 Since Rct is inversely proportional to the charge recombination rate between the photo-anode and the electrolyte interface, the lower Rct value means a higher charge recombination rate in TiO2@CdS-1 and bare TiO2 based cells. Thus, TiO2@ZnS-4 electrodes hold great potential for the fabrication of high-efficiency DSSCs. The Rct values can be controlled effectively by varying the number of ZnS SILAR cycles, surface area, loading, and roughness of the electroactive materials.53 Moreover, the relatively enhanced Rct value harvests the outstanding value of the electron lifetime of TiO2@ZnS-4 which subsidizes to possess Voc at a high level by eluding electron loss in the semiconductor. The appropriate quantity of ZnS particles leads to an amplified electron transfer process and enriched power conversion efficiency of the solar cells.
In UV-vis absorbance analysis, the TiO2@CdS-based films show higher absorption and the peaks are broadened compared with TiO2@ZnS films, but the EIS analysis showed a higher charge recombination rate and a lower chemical capacitance. CdS QDs are used in QDSSCs as a sensitizer.54 A good electrolyte with a redox mediator is required for the operation of DSSCs or QDSSCs. The use of a redox mediator in a solar cell can generate an oxidized sensitizer by donating an electron. Unfortunately, there is no efficient redox mediator for DSSCs and QDSSCs.
I−/I3− redox electrolyte can function well in DSSCs but not in CdS QDSSCs. Therefore, the electrolyte chosen plays a major role in determining the DSSC performance. In this study, we used I−/I3− redox electrolyte for DSSCs. The TiO2@CdS photo-anodes showed a higher recombination rate because of the unsuitable redox electrolyte.55 The minimal inclusion of ZnS particles in the I−/I3− redox electrolyte helps improve the performance of DSSCs compared with CdS QDs. Moreover, using an appropriate and efficient material as a compact layer leads to an increased electron transfer rate without charge recombination and improved conversion efficiency.
The electron lifetime (τe) in the bare TiO2, and TiO2@CdS-1- and TiO2@ZnS-4-based photo-anodes can be calculated from the maximum angular frequency of the impedance semi-circle arc in the mid-frequency range (fmax): τe = 1/2πfmax(2)where fmax is the peak frequency in this range. The τe values of bare TiO2, TiO2@CdS-1, and TiO2@ZnS-4 were 0.191, 0.061, and 0.178 ms, respectively. The fmax peak shifted towards a lower frequency range as shown in Fig. 7, which represents an enhanced electron lifetime.56,57 The fmax is inversely proportional to τe of the electrons, and a larger value of τe results from the lower back-reaction of electrons with the I−/I3− redox electrolyte. The overall τe value of the DSSCs depends on the diffusion length (Ln) and the electron recombination rate.58Ln can be calculated using the following equation: Ln2 = Deff × τe(3) Deff = (Rk/Rw)L2Keff(4)where Deff is the effective electron diffusion coefficient, Rk is the charge transfer resistance related to recombination, and Rw, Keff, and L are the electron transport resistance in the photo-anode, the effective rate constant for recombination, and the photo-anode thickness, respectively.

3.4 Photovoltaic analysis

Fig. 8 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSSCs with bare TiO2, TiO2@CdS, and TiO2@ZnS photo-anodes. The resulting J–V parameters are shown in Table 1, including the open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and power conversion efficiency (PCE). Under one sun illumination, the DSSCs with a bare TiO2 photo-anode had Voc, Jsc, and FF values of 0.65 V, 5.78 mA cm−2, and 0.75, respectively. Under each condition, we prepared three DSSCs and report the average values in this study. The DSSCs with a bare TiO2 photo-anode had a PCE of 2.84%. The photocurrent of the TiO2@CdS-based electrodes decreased as the CdS particles increased on the TiO2 surface, indicating greater inner energy loss (based on low Rct and low current density).59
 Fig. 8  Comparison of photocurrent density–voltage curves of (a) bare TiO2 and TiO2@ CdS and (b) bare TiO2 and TiO2@ ZnS photoanodes using the NiS counter-electrode under one sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). 
Under continuous sunlight illumination, the TiO2@ZnS-4 photo-anodes had a superior PCE of 4.91% in the I−/I3− electrolyte. The higher PCE mostly arises from the positive influence of ZnS particles, and the minimal number of ZnS SILAR cycles applied to TiO2 affects the absorbance of visible light and induces higher current density. The main reason for enhanced photovoltaic properties is that the replacement of Ti2+ by Zn2+ ions on the surface was greatly reinforced with an increase in surface stability compared to the bare TiO2 photo-anode. Moreover, Zn and S impurities have a drastic impact on the host material and can create new energy states, which can delay the exciton recombination and allow the charge separation. However, increasing the ZnS particles (TiO2@ZnS-5) led to lower charge transfer resistance, which is evidenced by the decreased diameter of the lower frequency semicircle. This could be explained in three ways. First, the overloading of ZnS onto TiO2 structures might retard the proton diffusion through the internal vacancies within the ternary structure, which can decrease the photocatalytic activity of proton reduction.28 Second, the higher ZnS loading on TiO2 may create grain boundaries that trap charge carriers during the charge-transfer process and decrease the photocatalytic reaction. Third, increasing the number of ZnS SILAR cycles may increase the optical band gap and the insulating properties of TiO2 films, which drastically reduce the rate of electron transfer from the TiO2@ZnS photo-anode to FTO.30
When the number of ZnS or CdS SILAR cycles is increased, the thickness of the film increases proportionally. The Rct value decreases with increases in the number of ZnS SILAR cycles, especially by 1 to 4 cycles. The results indicate that the charge transfer resistance and conductivity of the film can be improved by depositing ZnS on TiO2 surfaces, but upon exceeding 4 cycles, further deposition has no significant effect on the charge transfer.
The fast charge transfer at the photo-anode/electrolyte interface causes a change in the ion concentration in the solution and in the charge recombination rates at the counter-electrode/electrolyte interface. The photovoltaic performances of DSSCs with the bare TiO2, TiO2@CdS-4, and TiO2@ZnS-4 photo-anodes were compared based on the Rct values, as shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 shows an improvement in all cell parameters (FF, Jsc, and PCE) upon the introduction of ZnS, which is a strong indication of drastically increased charge recombination of the photo-anode in conjunction with the redox electrolyte. The increased Rct value of TiO2@ZnS-4 may also be responsible for improved Jsc, which would increase the injection and accumulation of photo-excited electrons in the conduction band of the photo-anode. Note that the PCE of DSSCs usually exhibits a low value of Rct.60 In this study, the TiO2@ZnS-4 photo-anode holds great potential for the fabrication of high-efficiency DSSCs compared to the bare TiO2 and TiO2@CdS-4.

Fig. 10 shows a DSSC structure consisting of TiO2, I−/I3− redox electrolyte, and a dye sensitizer. When the N719 dye absorbs light, the photoexcited electrons rapidly transfer to the conduction band of TiO2, and holes are released by the I−/I3− redox couple. During this process, an undesirable side process occurs: the electrons injected into the conduction band of TiO2 may reduce either the oxidized dye or recombine with the I−/I3− redox electrolyte (I3−).61 These two recombination processes are critical issues that must be reduced to enhance the PCE.62 Previous reports suggested that a tenfold decrease in the charge recombination will result in an increase in Voc of 50–60 mV.63
 Fig. 10  Schematic diagram of DSSCs without (a) and with (b) ZnS as a compact layer on the TiO2 film. 
This recombination can be decreased by oxide surface treatment through either organic modification or inorganic shell growth. For organic modification, thin shells of insulating oxides can be deposited over a TiO2 surface prior to N719 dye loading.64,65 For inorganic modification, co-adsorption of surface modifiers with N719 dye molecules can be used to avoid the direct contact between n-type TiO2 and the I−/I3− redox electrolyte or hole conductor material.66 However, the electron transport within the bare TiO2 film increases the recombination rate from the conduction band of TiO2 for the oxidized dye and I3− in the solution. In addition, introducing ZnS into the TiO2 photo-anode can effectively increase the dye loading and block the photogenerated electron leakage from the photo-anode to the electrolyte, which is beneficial for enhancement of the charge transfer resistance and the device stability. Therefore, ZnS deposition on TiO2 can retard the charge recombination process effectively and significantly increases Jsc in the photo-anode material. For the as-synthesized bare TiO2, a Jsc of 5.78 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 2.84% were achieved, whereas for TiO2@ZnS-4, Jsc and PCE were improved to 7.52 mA cm−2 and 4.91%, respectively.
4. Conclusion
Binary structures of TiO2@CdS and TiO2@ZnS were synthesized by a combination of the doctor-blade method and the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The structures exhibit a remarkably high light-absorption edge compared with bare TiO2. The solar light absorption was further enhanced by introducing N719 dye on the surface of these electrodes. We have demonstrated for the first time that ZnS or CdS-decorated TiO2 films can be used as photo-anodes in dye-sensitized solar cells. We compared TiO2@CdS-4 with TiO2@ZnS-4 and bare TiO2 and found TiO2@ZnS-4 to be the most efficient as a photo-anode owing to its faster charge transport, high accumulation of photo-injected electrons in the conduction band of the photo-anode, and greater light harvesting. An efficiency of 4.91% with a Jsc of 7.52 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.75, and a Voc of 0.68 V have been achieved under one sun illumination in conjunction with NiS as a counter-electrode and I−/I3− redox electrolyte. The detailed characterization and experimental results indicate that Zn and S impurities have a drastic impact on the host material and can create new energy states, which can delay the exciton recombination and allow the charge separation. Increasing the number of ZnS SILAR cycles proportionally decreases the power conversion efficiency and increases the charge recombination rate. Higher ZnS loading on TiO2 may create grain boundaries that trap charges during the charge-transfer process and decrease the photocatalytic reaction. We believe that our work demonstrates a promising method for the design and fabrication of a single electrode that acts as an efficient photocatalyst and a photo-anode.
