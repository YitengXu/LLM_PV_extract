    , Accepted 10th April 2022First published on 11th April 2022AbstractThe efficiency of photoanodes is the bottleneck of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. It is of great significance to develop low-cost and efficient photoanode materials. In this study, low-cost metal phthalocyanine complexes (MPcs) have been modified on the BVO surface as a novel molecular cocatalyst to construct a highly efficient organic–inorganic hybrid photoanode. Compared with the pristine BVO photoanode, the BVO/CoPc hybrid photoanode showed a ∼2.5 times enhancement with 3.23 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. Moreover, the potential at 0.5 mA cm−2 was shifted negatively by 310 mV after the modification of CoPc. Further characterizations and electrochemical analysis results showed that CoPc could significantly promote the migration of charge carriers and accelerate the kinetics of water oxidation, thus improving the PEC performance of the hybrid photoanodes. This work of the organic–inorganic hybrid photoanode provides a new route for the design of low-cost, highly efficient PEC devices.
Introduction
As an environmentally benign energy source, hydrogen is considered an ideal choice to replace fossil fuels in the coming future.1,2 In 1972, Fujishima and Honda reported that TiO2 semiconductors could convert solar energy into hydrogen fuel, which opened a new field of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting.3 Since then, water splitting through PEC cells has attracted extensive attention. In general, a photoanode is the critical challenge for PEC cells owing to the fact that the oxidation evolution reaction (OER) on photoanode involves a complex multi-charge transfer process, which needs to overcome the high energy barrier.4–6 Therefore, extensive efforts in the development of PEC cells are mainly focused on searching semiconductor materials to construct efficient photoanodes.
Among various semiconductor materials, BiVO4 (BVO), as an n-type semiconductor, is an ideal photoanode due to its abundance, easily scalable synthesis, suitable bandgap energy (2.4–2.5 eV), and highly oxidizing valence band edge.7–10 However, due to the characteristics of sluggish surface water oxidation kinetics and fast charge carrier recombination, the PEC performance of pristine BVO is far less than its maximum theoretical value.11 To eliminate these drawbacks, researchers are committed to modifying the photoanode surface with oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs), which could suppress the charge carrier recombination and accelerate the surface water oxidation kinetics.12–15 Up to now, numerous non-noble-metal-based OECs materials have been developed on BVO photoanodes, most of which are transition metal oxides16–19 and hydroxides.4,20–23 In general, these inorganic OECs are modified on the surface of BVO photoanodes by hydrothermal, immersing-annealing, and (photo)electrodeposition methods. In these synthesis processes, the content of OECs needs to be carefully and accurately controlled because it will effectively affect the light absorption capacity and charge transfer capacity of the photoanode. Thus, it is still a challenge to fabricate OECs/semiconductor hybrid photoanodes conveniently and efficiently.
In addition to these inorganic OECs, transition metal complexes have attracted extensive attention. When these transition metal complexes are modified on the surface of a semiconductor, their molecular orbitals will overlap with the electronic band of the semiconductor, which will reduce the energy barrier of the OER reaction and promote the PEC performance.24–26 Recently, some studies have found that modifying the surface of a BVO photoanode with transition metal complexes, such as transition metal porphyrin,27–30 transition metal cubane,31–35 and transition metal salophen,36 can achieve higher PEC water oxidation performance than the cases of those transition metal oxides and hydroxides. Moreover, these molecular/semiconductor hybrid photoanodes could be fabricated and controlled with a much simpler preparation procedure. Therefore, developing a low-cost, efficient, and convenient transition metal-based molecular catalyst as OECs is a very popular option. On the other hand, phthalocyanine is a planar macrocyclic structure with a large conjugated electronic system, which can easily coordinate with transition metal cations to form stable metal complexes due to the existence of four nitrogen atoms in the center. Besides, phthalocyanine is a completely synthetic compound, its structure can be facilely adjusted, and its ligand can be modified by hydroxyl or carboxyl groups. Thus, transition metal-based phthalocyanine molecules have great potential as OECs in theory. However, few efforts have been made to investigate metal phthalocyanine complexes as molecular OECs supported on BVO photoanodes.
In the present study, the metal phthalocyanine complexes (MPc: M = Co, Ni, Zn, Fe) were used as molecular OECs to modify the BVO semiconductor surface for PEC water splitting. Under optimal conditions, the BVO/CoPc hybrid photoanode showed a ∼2.5 times enhancement with 3.23 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. Moreover, the potential at 0.5 mA cm−2 was shifted negatively by 310 mV after the modification of CoPc. Further characterizations and electrochemical analysis revealed that CoPc not only promotes the charge transfer but also accelerates the water oxidation kinetics.
Results and discussion
The BVO/MPc hybrid photoanode preparation process is shown schematically in Fig. 1. The porous BVO photoanode was synthesized according to a procedure reported by Choi with a little modification.11 BiOI nanoarrays were first electrodeposited on the FTO substrate and then calcinated with VO(acac)2 to transform into BVO. The BVO/MPc photoanode was prepared by dropping certain amounts of metal phthalocyanine complex solutions onto the BVO surface (more details are described in the ESI†).
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the synthetic procedure of the BVO/MPc photoanode. 
The morphology of BVO and BVO/CoPc photoanodes are shown in Fig. 2a–d. Pristine BVO presents a three-dimensional nanoporous network structure with a thickness of about 1 μm (Fig. 2a and b). After the modification of CoPc, it is clearly seen that the surface was occupied by nanoblocks (Fig. 2c), and the thickness of the photoanode was increased to 1.5 μm (Fig. 2d), suggesting that CoPc was covered on the surface of BVO and the thickness was nearly 0.5 μm. The EDX analysis in Fig. 2e shows that the hybrid photoanode is composed of Bi, V, O, Co, C, and N elements, and no other purity elements are detected except evaporated platinum used for SEM measurements. In addition, EDX mapping results clearly show that CoPc is evenly distributed on the BVO surface (Fig. S1, ESI†). The XRD pattern of BVO and BVO/CoPc photoanodes are shown in Fig. 2f. All diffraction peaks of the photoanode correspond to SnO2 (PDF#46-1088) and monoclinic BiVO4 (PDF#83-1700), which indicates that monoclinic BiVO4 was successfully grown on the FTO substrate. As for the BVO/CoPc photoanode, all peaks are similar to the BVO samples, and no other peak is observed. It may be related to the molecular properties and limited content of CoPc, which is similar to a previously reported metal complex/semiconductor photoanode.30,37

The valence states of elements of the hybrid photoanode were further characterized by XPS spectra (Fig. 3). For the Bi 4f spectrum (Fig. 3a), the peaks of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 are located at 158.8 and 164.2 eV, representing the Bi3+ ion of BVO. For the V 2p spectrum (Fig. 3b), the peaks of V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 are located at 516.4 and 524.1 eV, representing the V5+ ion of BVO. It is worth noting that the binding energies of Bi 4f and V 2p of the hybrid photoanode are similar to those of pristine BVO photoanode (Fig. S2a and b, ESI†), indicating that the modification of CoPc has not changed the electronegativity of BVO. For the O 1s spectrum in Fig. 3c, the peak at 529.6 eV corresponds to the lattice oxygen of BVO, while the peak at 531.8 eV represents the existence of –OH groups.38,39 Compared with the O 1s spectrum of the BVO photoanode, the relative peak intensity of lattice oxygen is decreased, which may be related to the CoPc covered on the surface. For the C 1s spectrum in Fig. 3d, the peak at 284.8 eV corresponds to the C–C/CC group, the peak at 285.3 eV corresponds to the C–N group, and the peak at 286.4 eV corresponds to the CN group, respectively.40 For the N 1s spectrum in Fig. 3e, two peaks at 398.3 and 400.0 eV correspond to the pyrrole N and the C–N group.41 For the Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 3f), the peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 are located at 780.6 and 796.0 eV, respectively, representing the Co2+ ion of CoPc.42 These results demonstrated that CoPc is successfully decorated on the surface of BVO.

The FT-IR spectrum of BVO and BVO/CoPc photoanodes are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The FT-IR spectrum of pristine BVO shows three characteristic peaks, the peak at 476 cm−1 corresponds to the Bi–O vibrations, and the peaks at 824 and 733 cm−1 correspond to the V–O vibrations.43,44 Compared with that of BVO, the IR spectrum of BVO/CoPc contains several peaks at 1608, 1503, 1333, 1119, and 1087 cm−1, and the peaks located at 1608, 1503, 1119, and 1087 cm−1 correspond to the phthalocyanine skeletal vibrations,15,45 and the peak at 1333 cm−1 corresponds to the C–N stretching vibrations,46 which further proves that the BVO/CoPc photoanode has been successfully prepared. In order to explore the optical characteristics of the hybrid photoanode, the UV-vis spectrum of the sample was also recorded. The light absorption edge of BVO is located at 510 nm (Fig. S4, ESI†), which is similar to the previous literature.47 Interestingly, the light absorption edge of BVO/CoPc shows no difference from that of BVO, and a new peak at around 687 nm is observed. This peak is ascribed to the characteristic absorption peak of CoPc,42 further suggesting that the BVO/CoPc hybrid photoanode has been successfully prepared.

Fig. 4a shows the LSV curves of the different MPc (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Zn) coated BVO photoanodes. The photocurrent density of pristine BVO is 1.34 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. When the NiPc molecular catalyst is modified, the photocurrent density of the BVO/NiPc hybrid photoanode is significantly improved to 2.28 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. Moreover, the best PEC performance was obtained by the BVO/CoPc hybrid photoanode with the photocurrent density of 3.23 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. However, BVO/FePc and BVO/ZnPc hybrid photoanodes show slightly lower photocurrent density than that of pristine BVO, suggesting that FePc and ZnPc may not be suitable catalysts for modifying BVO. Thus, the BVO/CoPc photoanode was used for further investigations. Fig. 4b shows the LSV curves of BVO/CoPc photoanodes with different loading amounts of CoPc. The optimal loading content was 80 μL, and the resulting hybrid photoanode showed a ∼2.5 times enhancement with 3.23 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. Moreover, the potential at 0.5 mA cm−2 shifted negatively by 310 mV compared with pristine BVO. Thus, the BVO with 80 μL CoPc coating is abbreviated as BVO/CoPc in the following section. Besides, the LSV measurements of BVO and BVO/MPc photoanodes without irradiation were detected (Fig. S5, ESI†). The onset potential of BVO/CoPc showed the most negative shift, indicating that CoPc could significantly accelerate the water oxidation kinetics. BVO/NiPc also showed a negative shift compared with BVO, suggesting that NiPc also could accelerate the water oxidation kinetics. However, the photocurrent densities of BVO/FePc and BVO/ZnPc were slightly decreased compared to those of BVO, which may be because FePc and ZnPc cannot significantly accelerate the water oxidation kinetics of BVO. Moreover, APBE and IPCE of photoanodes were also performed to detect the efficiency of the BVO/CoPc hybrid photoanode. The maximum APBE value of BVO/CoPc was 1.09% at 0.67 VRHE (Fig. 4c), which is more efficient at a lower bias voltage than BVO (0.30% at 0.82 VRHE). As for the IPCE test (Fig. 4d), the efficiency of the BVO/CoPc photoanode reached 76% at 400 nm, which is also much higher than that of BVO, suggesting that this BVO/CoPc hybrid photoanode could significantly improve the photon to current conversion efficiency.

The photocurrent curve of the incident light with on/off alternation at 1.23 VRHE is shown in Fig. S6a (ESI†), and both photoanodes exhibited sensitive photocurrent responses during the on/off alternation. Due to the separation of the photogenerated electrons and hole pairs of the photoanode, the peak of anode photocurrent appears at the moment of turning on illumination. Subsequently, the accumulated photogenerated holes and electrons recombine on the surface, resulting in photocurrent attenuation. It is obvious that the current decay rate of BVO is faster than that of BVO/CoPc, indicating that modified CoPc could reduce the surface charge recombination of BVO. Moreover, the steady-state photocurrent of BVO/CoPc also is nearly 2.5 times higher than that of BVO, which is similar to that of LSV in Fig. 4a. In order to quantitatively analyze the effect of CoPc on inhibiting BVO charge recombination, the long-term transient photocurrent curve was further studied48 (Fig. S6b, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S6c (ESI†), the lifetime of BVO/CoPc photoanode (75 s) is ∼5 times longer than that of BVO (15 s), further suggesting that CoPc could efficiently inhibit the surface charge recombination of BVO. The stability of the photoanodes is shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). It is obvious that the BVO/CoPc photoanode shows better stability than the BVO photoanode, and about 60% of the PEC activity was kept on the BVO/CoPc photoanode, while only 11% of the PEC activity was kept on the BVO photoanode after 1 h PEC water splitting process at 1.23 VRHE, suggesting that CoPc modification could significantly improve the BVO photoanode stability. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of BVO/CoPc after a long-term test. The binding energies of C 1s, N 1s, and Co 2p were consistent with the as-prepared BVO/CoPc photoanode, indicating that CoPc structure was not changed during the OER reaction. In addition, the FT-IR (Fig. S9, ESI†) and UV-vis spectra (Fig. S10, ESI†) of BVO/CoPc after the long-term test were also detected, and there were no changes in BVO/CoPc before and after the long-term test, further demonstrating that BVO/CoPc is stable during the photoelectrochemical water splitting reaction.
In order to understand the charge transfer characteristics of the BVO/CoPc hybrid photoanode, the EIS measurement was detected (Fig. 5a). The semicircle arc of the BVO/CoPc hybrid photoanode is smaller than that of pristine BVO photoanode, suggesting that the BVO/CoPc hybrid photoanode has a faster hole transfer process at the interface. In addition, an appropriate EIS fitting model is selected and shown in the inset of Fig. 5a according to the pattern of the measurement curve. Rs and Rct represent the charge transfer resistance of the photoanode and the photoanode/electrolyte interface, respectively. The fitting result showed that both Rs and Rct values of the BVO/CoPc photoanode are smaller than that of the BVO photoanode (Table S1, ESI†). Notably, BVO/CoPc has a remarkably smaller Rct value (180.8 Ω) than that of the pristine BVO (436.6 Ω), suggesting that BVO/CoPc has better charge transfer ability, particularly at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. Fig. 5b shows the Mott–Schottky plots of BVO and BVO/CoPc hybrid photoanodes. Due to the n-type feature of the BVO semiconductor, the curves of both photoanodes show a positive slope. The flat band voltage (Vfb) and carrier density (Nd) values calculated by Mott–Schottky plots are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The Vfb shifted from 0.77 V to 0.73 V negatively after the decoration of CoPc, indicating that the surface Fermi level pinning effect is reduced.49 In addition, BVO/CoPc exhibits a much higher Nd value than pristine BVO, which is conducive to charge transfer. Fig. 5c shows the dark/light open circuit potentials (OCP). The photovoltage of BVO/CoPc was 0.53 V, which was much larger than that of BVO. It is well known that the difference in OCP under dark and light conditions corresponds to the band bending ability at the photoanode/electrolyte interface.50 Thus, the larger photovoltage value of the BVO/CoPc hybrid photoanode indicates that CoPc can increase the rate of charge injection from the photoanode into the electrolyte. In order to further test the surface separation efficiency of photogenerated holes of the hybrid photoanode, the surface reaction was investigated with Na2SO3 as the sacrificial agent. In the presence of Na2SO3, the reaction has very fast oxidation kinetics, and its surface recombination can be ignored. Fig. S11 (ESI†) displays the LSV curves of BVO and BVO/CoPc in the absence/presence of Na2SO3, and the ηsurface was calculated according to these curves, as shown in Fig. 5d. The ηsurface value of the BVO/CoPc hybrid photoanode (56%) was much higher than that of the pristine BVO photoanode (25%) at 1.23 VRHE, suggesting that the BVO/CoPc photoanode has much faster water oxidation kinetics than pristine BVO, indicating that CoPc could significantly enhance the surface separation efficiency of BVO.

Based on the analysis of the above results, a possible mechanism of PEC water splitting by the BVO/CoPc hybrid photoanode was proposed (Fig. 6). BVO generates electron–hole pairs under simulated sunlight illumination, and then holes migrate to the surface of BVO for the water oxidation reaction or recombine with electrons that are trapped by the surface. However, due to the sluggish kinetics of water oxidation on the BVO surface, holes cannot inject the electrolyte in time for the water oxidation reaction and accumulate on the BVO surface, which increases the chance of recombination with electrons. As for the BVO/CoPc hybrid photoanode, the modification of CoPc could effectively migrate the holes from the BVO surface to CoPc, which inhibits the accumulation and the recombination of holes. Moreover, owing to the fast water oxidation kinetics of CoPc, the migrated holes could undergo the water oxidation reaction soon, which greatly improves the PEC water splitting efficiency.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a novel and efficient organic–inorganic hybrid photoanode based on metal phthalocyanine and BVO semiconductor was successfully developed for PEC water splitting. Under optimal conditions, the CoPc-modified BVO photoanode showed a ∼2.5 times enhancement with 3.23 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. The potential at 0.5 mA cm−2 was shifted negatively by 310 mV after the modification of CoPc. Besides, the stability of BVO has also significantly improved after surface modification with the CoPc complex. This work shows that metal phthalocyanine complexes could be used as efficient organic OECs to improve the PEC performance of semiconductor photoanodes, which opens up a new way for the design of high-performance organic–inorganic hybrid photoanodes.
