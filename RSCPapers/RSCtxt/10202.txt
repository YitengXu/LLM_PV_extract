    , Accepted 24th October 2020First published on 26th October 2020AbstractThe all-vanadium redox flow battery is considered to be a dispersive and non-perennial energy source due to its grid reliability, high efficiency, standalone modular design, and excellent cycling stability. However, the large vanadium ionic size and relatively high viscosity lead to poor compatibility with most carbon-based microporous electrodes, resulting in sluggish mass diffusion and unsatisfied capacitance retention. Herein, a novel cross-coupled porous graphene aerogel is proposed via the NaNO3-template pore engineering strategy. The microscopic observations and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms validate the successful regulation of the surface area and porous structure, with the addition of different porogen contents (6.25–25 g L−1). The vanadium redox flow battery delivers a specific capacity of 163.4 mA h g−1 (5.6 A h L−1) at a current density of 25 mA cm−2, surpassing most previously reported batteries with a similar reactor volume. This method holds great promise for the better design and preparation of porous electrodes, and potential suitable applications.
Formidable sustainability challenges from the use of fossil fuels and resource constraints have spurred great interest in renewable energy storage and conversion systems such as solar and wind energy.1,2 However, the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy sources makes their continuous use impossible. The all-vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) is considered a competitive strategy due to its grid reliability, high efficiency, standalone modular design, and excellent cycling stability.3–5 VRBs capitalize on four different oxidation states of vanadium to form two redox couples. The energy conversions are realized via changes in the vanadium valence states at the cathode [VO2+/VO2+] and anode [V2+/V3+]. The electrode reactions are as follows:
Cathode-side: VO2+ + 2H+ + e− = VO2+ + H2O(1)
Anode-side: V2+ − e− = V3+(2)
Cell reaction: VO2+ + V2+ + 2H+ = VO2+ + V3+ + H2O(3)
Three-dimensional (3D) carbon aerogels have emerged as promising electrode candidates compared with conventional carbon paper (CP) and graphite felt (GF).5–8 These gels are composed of synthetic solid materials with nanometric pores filled with air.9–11 The continuous carbonaceous skeleton typically serves as an electron transport expressway and is critical for rapid electron transport. The self-standing nature of aerogels also eliminates the need for a specific binder and current collector, and minimizes the contact resistance. For example, Jiang et al. modified the GF-fibers with carbon aerogel to obtain a high specific surface area (∼57.2 m2 g−1). The energy efficiency of the VRB device reached 75.8% at 160 mA cm−2, which was 32.5% higher than that of the pristine GF support.7 However, the large vanadium ionic size and relatively high viscosity always lead to poor compatibility with most micropore-dominated carbon aerogels, resulting in sluggish mass diffusion and unsatisfied energy delivery under high current densities. Recently, pore engineering is proposed as an effective approach to boost the performance of carbon-based electrodes.12 A rational design of aerogels with gradient pores is considered to favor the decrease of charge voltage and increase of discharge voltage.13
Herein, we fabricated a novel cross-coupled porous graphene aerogel (GA) via the NaNO3-template strategy. The NaNO3 salt crystals served as both template and porogen in the GA, and could be easily removed by treatment under an Ar atmosphere at 800 °C. The microscopic observations and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms demonstrated that the surface area and porous structure could be successfully regulated using different NaNO3 porogen contents (i.e., 0, 6.25, 12.5, and 25 g L−1). The lab-scale VRB device delivered a specific capacity of 163.4 mA h g−1 (5.6 A h L−1) at a current density of 25 mA cm−2.
The synthetic procedure of pore-engineered GA (PEGA) is illustrated in Fig. 1. Graphene oxide (GO) solution (5 mg mL−1) was prepared according to the previously reported Hummers’ method.14 We added gradient NaNO3 porogen into GO dispersions as follows: 0 (GA), 6.25 g L−1 (PEGA-6.25), 12.5 g L−1 (PEGA-12.5), 25 g L−1 (PEGA-25) and 37.5 g L−1 (PEGA-37.5). 10 mL of each mixture was put into a hydrothermal reactor, and heated at 180 °C for 12 hours to build the hydrogels as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). We transferred the hydrogels into glass vials and placed them on a pre-cooling metal plate. The frozen hydrogels were freeze-dried to composite aerogels using a freeze dryer (Scientz-12N, Scientz Biotechnology Co., Ltd, China). We treated the aerogels under an Ar atmosphere at 800 °C for 1 hour. NaNO3 powders were decomposed into N2, O2, and NO under high temperature, leaving Na2O in the aerogel. The Na2O residue was finally removed by rinsing the aerogels in deionized water.15 Notably, PEGA could not retain good mechanical stability at 37.5 g L−1, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The scaffold supporting the PEGA architecture was prone to collapsing with a continuous increase in porogen content. Therefore, we stopped the NaNO3 concentration at 25 g L−1 to guarantee a stable electrode structure.

The physical and electrochemical characterization methods are detailed in the ESI.†
The morphology and microstructures of PEGA were characterized using a number of techniques. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images [Fig. 2 and Fig. S3 (ESI†)] revealed that GA possessed a 3D interconnected porous structure. The pores contained in pristine GA were unordered and macro-type (>10 μm) dominated. After treatment with the NaNO3 salt crystals as both the template and porogen, the number of pores increased and the pore structure turned to micro- and meso-type. This change might be beneficial for increasing the surface area available for electrochemical reactions. Transition electron microscope (TEM) images [Fig. S4 (ESI†)] showed the amorphous morphology of PEGA and ordered graphitic structure during the reduction process. The lattice fringes with an interlayer distance of ∼0.34 nm agreed well with the spacing between graphene planes.
 Fig. 2  SEM images showing the porous structure of GA with different porogen contents: (a) GA; (b) PEGA-6.25; (c) PEGA-12.5; and (d) PEGA-25. 
As seen in Fig. S5 (ESI†), pristine GA and PEGA with different porogen content had a similar X-ray diffraction pattern. A typical powder diffraction peak occurred at 2θ = 26.2°, corresponding to the (002) plane of the graphite structure. The formation of a graphite-like structure of GA and PEGAs indicated the highly efficient removal of oxygen-containing groups.16 Elementary dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping further determined the impact of the NaNO3-template on GA properties [Fig. S6 (ESI†)]. For PEGAs, it revealed that carbon dominated the elementary contents (>at. 85%), with a low oxygen signal (at. 5–7.5%). Traces of sodium (<at. 5.51%) were observed, indicating that the NaNO3 powders were basically removed under the high-temperature treatment procedure. A previous study demonstrated that this residual sodium had little impact on the VRB performance and could be totally removed by rinsing in deionized water.17 Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the graphitization degree of the samples within the shift in the range of 1100–3200 cm−1 (Fig. 3a). Two distinct peaks appeared at the positions of 1330 cm−1 and 1590 cm−1, which are precisely assigned to the disordered band (D) and graphitic band (G) of graphene. The intensity ratios of D/G bands (ID/IG) were calculated to evaluate the disorder degrees in graphene monolayers. The values of ID/IG were calculated to be 1.21, 1.23, 1.22, and 1.21 in the cases of GA, PEGA-6.25, PEGA-12. 5, and PEGA-25, respectively. All values of ID/IG were higher than 1.2 and revealed that GO was completely reduced to rGO during the aerogel preparation process.18

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were collected to characterize the porous structure and compare the surface area of different composites. As shown in Fig. 3b, PEGA yields a Type-IV adsorption–desorption isotherm, evidencing the dominance of mesopores (pore diameters of 2–50 nm). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas were determined to be 34.3, 156.9, 207.4, and 273.5 m2 g−1 for GA, PEGA-6.25, PEGA-12.5, and PEGA-25, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). The mesoporous structure was considered to significantly increase the specific surface area and facilitate reactant transport. As shown in Fig. 3c and Table S1 (ESI†), the average pore sizes were estimated to be 41.2 nm (GA), 5.4 nm (PEGA-6.25), 3.7 nm (PEGA-12.5), and 2.9 nm (PEGA-25), respectively, which were consistent with the conclusions drawn from the SEM observations. These results suggested the PEGA electrodes were composed of a hierarchically porous structure containing micro-, meso-, and macropores.
We collected the CV plots in 1.5 M VOSO4/2 M H2SO4 electrolyte at 10 mV s−1 with an electrode surface area of 1 cm2. These plots displayed a pair of pronounced peaks corresponding to the redox reactions (Fig. 4a). An oxidation (anodic) peak at ∼1.1 V came from the oxidation of V4+ to V5+. A further oxidation peak at ∼0.6 V related to the transformation of V2+ to V3+. The reduction (cathodic) peak at ∼0.8 V was the reverse reaction of V5+ to V4+. Noticeably, PEGA-12.5 displayed the most intense redox peak, reflecting its highest catalytic performance. It delivered a cathodic current of 21.7 mA, which was 1.2, 1.1, and 1.3 times higher than those of GA, PEGA-6.25, and PEGA-25, respectively. This demonstrated that the introduction of abundant micropores could significantly increase the surface area of carbonaceous materials. These pores could also function as the electrolyte reservoirs that shortened the ion diffusion length. The ion-transport could be effectively facilitated via the rational construction of an interconnected network consisting of gradient pores. However, with the continuous increase in the amount of porogen content (25 g L−1), the micropore surface area was decreased as shown in Fig. 3(d). The combination of large surface area and efficient ion-diffusion for PEGA-12.5 greatly increased the ion-accessible surface area.

To gain insights into the internal resistance and charge-transfer properties of the PEGA electrodes, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were collected (Fig. 4b). Nyquist plots exhibited a semicircle in the middle-frequency (charge-transfer resistance, RCT) followed by a straight line in the low-frequency (Warburg resistance, Rs).19,20 The lowest value of RCT was estimated to be 7.5 Ω for PEGA-12.5, suggesting a fast charge-transfer within the electrode as the PEGA-12.5 possessed the highest specific surface area and micropore volume. Furthermore, the values of Rs were also evaluated to be 50 Ω (GA), 36.2 Ω (PEGA-6.25), 25.6 Ω (PEGA-12.5), and 38.7 Ω (PEGA-25) according to the nearly vertical straight lines. This demonstrated the fastest vanadium ion-diffusion rate from electrolyte to cathode for PEGA-12.5. EIS results confirmed our speculation that the porous network of PEGA possessed a remarkable ability for electron transfer and reactant transportation. Meanwhile, the power-density curves also demonstrated that the VRB device with PEGA-12.5 electrode delivered a maximum power density of 126.5 mW cm−2 [Fig. S7 (ESI†)]. With further increasing the porogen content to 25 g L−1, the output voltage dropped seriously. It agreed well with the EIS and BET results that the electrodes with high micropore surface area played a crucial role in VRB performance. The VRB device delivered the specific capacity of 163.4 mA h g−1 (5.6 A h L−1) for the PEGA-12.5 electrode, which was much higher than those of previously reported batteries with similar reactor volume (Fig. 4d and Table 1), and graphene-based electrodes in the VFB applications [Table S1 (ESI†)]. The PEGA electrode exhibits a good energy efficiency with a flexible pore-structure controlling strategy. Nevertheless, the voltage drop at the beginning of the discharging procedure was typically attributed to a fast charge/discharge rate and concentration polarization. Meanwhile, the value of capacity reported here is still several fold lower than those of Li–S, Zn-ion batteries. This performance gap may be due to the limited reaction activity within the electrode and sluggish ion transportation, which are our next challenging issues.

We demonstrated a novel 3D cross-coupled hierarchical macro–meso porous graphene aerogel via an easily scalable NaNO3-template strategy. SEM images and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms demonstrated that the specific surface area and porous structure of graphene aerogels could be easily regulated by controlling the NaNO3 content. The graphene aerogel exhibited a robust charge transfer and mass transportation performance with low electrode impedance. The VRB delivered a specific capacity of 163.4 mA h g−1 (5.6 A h L−1) at a discharging current density of 25 mA cm−2, which was superior to most previously reported batteries with a similar scale. It also exhibited a better energy efficiency and very flexible pore-structure controlling strategy compared to those of other graphene-based electrodes. The result in this work broadens the avenues to the better design and preparation of aerogels and for exploring suitable applications in VRBs. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that the OCP value and discharge stability are still insufficient, which are most likely caused by the unfavourable parasitic reaction. To further improve the practicability, we tried to eliminate the parasitic reaction by doping heteroatoms (e.g. N, P-doped) and optimizing the operational conditions.
