    , Accepted 29th June 2016First published on 4th July 2016AbstractThe fabrication of artificial photosynthetic systems to convert solar energy into electrical power is of great importance to meet human needs for energy; photosystem II (PSII), the core enzyme for water splitting in natural solar energy conversion processes can be introduced for this purpose. However, there remain significant challenges in the facile preparation of such semi-artificial photoanode systems with enhanced photocurrent responses. Herein we report a hybrid photoanode system consisting of PSII from spinach integrated into an indium-tin oxide electrode modified with nanotubular titania that is synthesized by using cellulose paper as a scaffold. This electrode provides a well-defined hierarchical nanostructure for protein loading, and the fine titania nanocrystals facilitate electron transfer from PSII to the electrode. The resulting semiconductor–protein hybrid photo-bioelectrochemical system enhances direct electron transfer (1.3 μA cm−2) and mediated electron transfer (10.6 μA cm−2) photocurrents.
Introduction
Photosynthesis is the largest-scale sustainable energy conversion process in nature for solar energy conversion into chemical energy.1,2 Artificial solar conversion systems, such as photoelectrochemical cells, inspired by the natural photosynthetic system have been the most promising area of chemistry to meet human needs for energy over the past several decades.3–10 In addition, artificial hybrid photo-bioelectrochemical cells based on the native photosynthetic system have attracted much attention. The environmentally friendly photo-bioelectrochemical systems possess potential applications in converting solar energy into electrical power in a renewable way.11–16
PSII is the core enzyme complex in the photosynthetic chain of the natural solar energy conversion system and responsible for the efficient extraction of electrons from water, evolution of O2, and establishment of the proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis.17,18 It is worth noting that PSII provides insights into the fabrication of synthetic solar conversion systems.19 Nowadays, an emerging technique named protein film photoelectrochemistry (PF-PEC) allows for PSII absorption on an electrode surface, and the resulting PSII PF-PEC cells serve as artificial water oxidation systems or photo-bioelectrochemical cells.20–22 In recent studies, noble metal electrodes such as Au have been used for assembling PSII on their surfaces, whereas the flat and hydrophobic surfaces of noble metals necessitate surface functionalization for PSII integration,23–25 where thiolate-monolayers with terminal Ni(II)–nitrilotriacetic acid complexes have been commonly used to achieve self-assembled monolayers (SAMs).23,24 The use of a redox polymer provides another method to entrap PSII on the surface of these metal electrodes.26–30 However, it is uneconomic and inconvenient to use noble metals in practical applications. Furthermore, metal oxides such as mesoporous indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrodes or SAM-functionalized mesoporous ITO electrodes were employed for solar water splitting, in which the three-dimensional metal oxide environment allows for high protein loading.31,32 To date, there still remain significant challenges in the facile fabrication of such PSII-based semi-artificial photoanode systems with superior photocurrent responses.
It has been intensively investigated that metal oxide semiconductors, such as TiO2,33,34 ZnO,35 WO3,36 Fe2O3,37 and NiO,38 can be used as photoanodes for water splitting. Among the various semiconductor materials developed to construct photoelectrochemical devices, TiO2 is one of the most promising choices due to its low-cost, superior chemical and optical stability and high photocatalytic efficiency.39 Furthermore, various titania based nanostructures including nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanorods, nanowires and three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured materials have been fabricated to improve the photoelectrochemical performances, especially the nanotubes.34 In our previous work, hierarchical nanotubular titania materials have been synthesized through a layer-by-layer self-assembly process.40 However, the widespread use of TiO2 is restricted by the low optical absorption of solar energy in the visible region. Therefore, PSII with good absorption in the visible region is considered to combine with TiO2 to assemble a semiconductor–protein hybrid photoanode system with enhanced photoelectrochemical performance.
We report here a strategy to assemble a hybrid photoanode system with PSII integrated into a hierarchical nanotubular titania-modified ITO electrode, and considerable photocurrent responses were successfully achieved. A schematic representation of our hybrid electrode fabrication is shown in Fig. 1. The nanotubular titania materials achieved by a surface sol–gel method using natural cellulose substances as scaffolds were assembled on the ITO electrode. Thereafter, PSII isolated from spinach leaves was integrated into the hierarchical nanotubular titania-modified ITO electrode with a large specific surface area. This photoanode system has several advantages and has resulted in relatively higher photocurrent responses for both direct electron transfer (DET) and mediated electron transfer (MET). From the point of view of materials synthesis, natural cellulose substances (e.g., filter paper) with a well-defined hierarchical nanofibrous structure are considered to be a perfect choice to act as bio-templates for nanomaterial fabrication, such as nanotubular titania.40 PSII could be integrated into the nanotubular titania-modified electrode, and thus higher protein loading and good electrical contact between the protein and the electrode were achieved due to the unique structure of the fabricated titania materials. In addition, superior photocurrent responses for both DET and MET were achieved by this PSII-based photo-bioelectrochemical cell.

Experimental
Materials
Titanium(IV) n-butoxide (97%), 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) (98%) and titania nanopowder (25 nm, 99.7% trace metals basis) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Filter paper (quantitative ashless) was bought from Hangzhou Xinhua Paper Industry Co., Ltd. (China). Organic solvents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All chemicals were guaranteed reagents and were used without further purification.
Isolation of PSII enriched BBY particles
The PSII enriched membrane particles (BBY particles) were isolated from leaves of spinach and purified according to previously reported methods.41 The concentration of chlorophyll in a PSII stock solution was determined by UV-vis spectroscopy to be about 3.2 mg Chl mL−1. PSII was stored in a buffer solution containing 25 mM MES, 0.4 M sucrose, 0.5 M betaine, 15 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl2 at pH 6.5 in liquid nitrogen.
Synthesis of the nanotubular titania materials
Titanium(IV) n-butoxide solution (100 mM in toluene/ethanol, v/v = 1:1) was used as a precursor to prepare filter paper composites pre-coated with titania thin gel films by a surface sol–gel method according to a previous report.40 Thereafter, each cellulose nanofibre of the filter paper was coated with a 0.5 nm titania thin gel layer by one deposition cycle.42 This surface sol–gel deposition cycle was repeated n times to obtain titania thin gel films with varying film thickness pre-coated filter paper composite sheets, denoted as (TiO2)n/cellulose. The as-deposited composite sheet was then calcined in air at 500 °C for 6 h (heating rate 1 °C min−1) to remove the cellulose, and the titania thin gel films were then transformed into anatase titania materials with hierarchical nanotubular structures, which were denoted as (TiO2)n-NTs.
Fabrication of PSII-modified ITO electrode
ITO slides (0.6 × 2.5 cm2) were ultrasonicated in deionized water for 20 min, followed by rinsing in ethanol for 20 min, and then dried at room temperature in air.
The PSII stock solution was diluted with 20 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonic acid (MES) (pH 6.5) to establish the concentration of chlorophyll in the solution to be about 1.0 mg Chl mL−1. 20 μL of diluted PSII solution was transferred onto the ITO slide and left at 4 °C in the dark for 1 h followed by drying the slide using nitrogen. The resulting electrode was denoted as PSII-modified ITO electrode and was used as a working electrode.
Fabrication of (TiO2)n-NT or TiO2(C)-modified ITO electrodes
The prepared nanotubular titania materials ((TiO2)n-NTs) or titania nanopowder (TiO2(C)) was sonicated in ethanol for 10 min to obtain suspensions with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1. Each suspension (20 μL) was transferred onto the ITO slide (0.6 × 2.5 cm2) and then dried in air. Another 20 μL suspension was also spread onto the ITO slide followed by drying in air. The resulting electrodes were denoted as (TiO2)n-NT or TiO2(C)-modified ITO electrodes and were used as working electrodes.
Besides, 80 μL, 20 μL, 10 μL and 5 μL suspensions of (TiO2)5-NTs were dropped onto the ITO slides respectively to test the influence of the TiO2 nanotube amount on the photocurrent responses.
Fabrication of PSII/(TiO2)n-NT or PSII/TiO2(C)-modified ITO electrodes
The diluted PSII solution with a concentration of chlorophyll about 1.0 mg Chl mL−1 was dropped onto the (TiO2)n-NT or TiO2(C)-modified ITO electrodes and left at 4 °C in the dark for 1 h followed by drying the electrodes using nitrogen. The resulting electrodes were denoted as PSII/(TiO2)n-NT or PSII/TiO2(C)-modified ITO electrodes and were used as working electrodes.
Besides, 20 μL of (TiO2)5-NT suspension and 10 μL of diluted PSII solution were alternately deposited onto the ITO slide twice. This fabricated electrode was denoted as PSII/(TiO2)5/PSII/(TiO2)5-modified ITO electrode.
Characterization
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were acquired on a Hitachi S4800 instrument at an acceleration voltage of 15.0 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) observations were performed on a FEI Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV to observe the morphologies and the size distributions of the nanotubular titania materials. The crystal phases of the nanotubular titania materials were observed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements conducted on an Empyrean diffractometer with a CuKα (λ = 0.15405 nm) radiation source. Raman spectra were acquired using a Renishaw inVia plus Raman spectrometer operating at an excitation wavelength of λ = 514 nm. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer to determine the absorption ranges of the modified electrodes.
Evaluation of electrochemical performance
Electrochemical measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Shanghai, China) equipped with a 200 W high pressure xenon lamp. The prepared modified ITO electrodes were used as working electrodes, while a platinum wire was used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode. All electrodes were immersed in an electrolyte buffer solution containing 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 3 mM CaCl2 and 20 mM MES. The pH of the electrolyte buffer solution was adjusted to 6.5 by using 200 mM MES. The height of the electrolyte solution level in the electrochemical cell was estimated to be 1.3 cm, therefore the area of the working electrodes immersed in the electrolyte solution was calculated to be 0.78 cm2 (0.6 × 1.3 cm2). A 550 nm filter and an 800 nm filter were put between the electrochemical cell and the xenon lamp to obtain irradiation by red light. Besides, only an 800 nm filter was inserted in the light path for white light irradiation. All photoelectrochemical measurements were performed at 25 °C and a bias potential of +0.25 V vs. SCE was applied. In addition, 1 mM DCBQ was added to the electrolyte buffer solution as an electron transfer mediator. Photoelectrochemical measurements were also conducted under red light and white light irradiation.
Six LEDs were connected in parallel between the working electrode and the electrochemical workstation. The bare ITO electrode, and PSII, (TiO2)5-NT and PSII/(TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrodes were used as the working electrodes. A bias potential of +1.7 V vs. SCE was applied using the electrochemical workstation, and the potential difference between the two sides of the LEDs was measured to be ∼1.5 V. 1 mM DCBQ was added to the electrolyte buffer solution as an electron transfer mediator, and only an 800 nm filter was inserted in the light path for white light irradiation simulating the sunlight.
Results and discussion
Structure identification
The titania thin gel film pre-coated filter paper composite sheets were prepared by a surface sol–gel method using natural cellulose (e.g., commercial filter paper) as a scaffold. Thereafter, nanotubular titania materials were obtained by calcination of the composite sheets. Titania gel films with a thickness of 0.5 nm were coated on the surface of cellulose nanofibres after one surface sol–gel deposition cycle,42 and the cycle was repeated n (n = 5, 10, 20) times to obtain titania gel film pre-coated filter paper composite sheets with varied thickness of the titania layer, denoted as (TiO2)n/cellulose. The as-deposited composite sheets were calcined in air to remove the cellulose and the titania thin gel films were transformed into anatase titania materials with hierarchical porous nanotubular structures ((TiO2)n-NTs) (Fig. S1, see ESI†). In detail, as shown in Fig. 2, the diameters of individual titania nanotubes range from 50 to 200 nm, and the sizes of the nanoparticles forming the nanotubes vary with the different deposition cycles of titania thin gel films. The particle sizes of (TiO2)5-NTs, (TiO2)10-NTs and (TiO2)20-NTs were estimated to be 11 ± 1, 10 ± 1 and 14 ± 1 nm, respectively (Fig. S2, see the ESI†). The HR-TEM micrographs of the nanocrystallites forming the prepared titania nanotubes show clear crystal lattices with an interplanar distance of 0.35 nm, which is attributed to the (101) plane of anatase phase titania (Fig. 2). These fabricated nanotubular titania materials ((TiO2)n-NTs) were spread on the ITO electrodes for PSII assembly and further photocurrent generation. These prepared titania materials possess a hierarchical nanostructure with space between each nanotube. Moreover, a BET surface area of 26.4 m2 g−1 was obtained from N2 sorption isotherms in the previous work,43 which is larger than that of the flat structure. Therefore, the nanotubular titania-modified ITO electrodes are well suited to immobilize PSII. Commercial titania nanopowder (25 nm) denoted as TiO2(C) was assembled on the ITO electrode in the same way for comparison. The titania nanoparticles in TiO2(C) aggregate loosely (Fig. S3, see ESI†).
 Fig. 2  Left column shows FE-SEM images of (TiO2)5-NTs (a), (TiO2)10-NTs (b) and (TiO2)20-NTs (c); insets show the photographs of the corresponding materials. Right column displays enlarged TEM images of the corresponding individual titania nanotubes; insets show the corresponding HR-TEM images. 
XRD patterns of the prepared nanotubular titania materials and purchased commercial titania nanopowder are shown in Fig. S4a,† in which the eleven peaks located at 2θ = 25.4, 37.0, 37.9, 38.6, 48.1, 54.0, 55.1, 62.1, 62.7, 68.8 and 70.3° are assigned to the (101), (103), (004), (112), (200), (105), (211), (213), (204), (116) and (220) reflections of anatase titania (JCPDS card no. 89-4921). Raman spectra of these titania materials exhibit five main bands at 144, 197, 400, 519 and 640 cm−1, corresponding to the Eg and B1g modes of anatase phase titania (Fig. S4b, see ESI†).44 It is demonstrated that all titania materials are in the pure anatase crystal phase.
The diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra of the PSII, (TiO2)5-NT and PSII/(TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrodes are displayed in Fig. 3a. The absorption bands at 436 and 676 nm with an absorbance maximum at 676 nm in the spectra of both PSII and PSII/(TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrodes are attributed to the absorption of PSII,45 and the similar absorption band indicates that PSII was certainly integrated into the modified ITO electrode. The band at 312 nm in the spectrum of the (TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrode is assigned to the absorption of anatase titania. In contrast, the absorption band of anatase titania shifts a little in the spectrum of the PSII/(TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrode, indicating the close integration of PSII and (TiO2)5-NTs.

Photoelectrochemical measurements with PSII, (TiO2)5-NT and PSII/(TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrodes under irradiation by red light or white light are presented in Fig. 3b and c. Under red light irradiation, the initial DET photocurrent response of the PSII/(TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrode (0.035 μA cm−2) is about 6 times that of the PSII-modified ITO electrode (0.006 μA cm−2) (Fig. 3b). Under white light irradiation, the photocurrent response of the (TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrode was also detected, because the electron transfer from the valence band to the conduction band of titania can occur. The initial DET photocurrent responses of 0.009 and 0.5 μA cm−2 were observed for PSII and (TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrodes under white light irradiation, respectively (Fig. 3c). It is worth noting that the DET photocurrent response of the PSII/(TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrode could reach up to 1.3 μA cm−2, which is about 2.5-fold the sum of the photocurrent responses of PSII and (TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrodes (Fig. 3c). It is reasonable to suppose that cascaded electron transfer occurs between PSII and the fabricated nanotubular titania material. The achieved DET photocurrent is superior compared to the results obtained using ITO as the electrode in other research studies,28,31,32 and the result is better than that obtained using a SAM-modified ITO electrode (0.43 μA cm−2).32 It is indicated that the photocurrent of the hybrid PSII/TiO2 photoanode system is about 2.6 times larger than that of the pure TiO2 nanotubes layer (Fig. 3d). In fact, the contribution to the hybrid system photocurrent from the TiO2 substrate is less than 40% (estimated as 38%). Furthermore, the photocurrent value of the hybrid PSII/TiO2 after subtracting the contribution from the TiO2 layer is observed to be much higher compared to that of the pure PSII photoanode itself as shown in Fig. 3d, indicating a good synergy effect between the TiO2 and PSII. Thus, the immobilised PSII plays a key role in the photocurrent generation, which benefits from the TiO2 nanotube modification on the electrode. In addition, the photocurrent of this hybrid PSII/TiO2 electrode is closely related to the loading amount of the TiO2 nanotubes on the electrode. More charge separation can occur when a larger amount of TiO2 nanotubes was loaded on the electrode. As shown in Fig. 3e, the photocurrent responses were indeed enhanced with the increase of the amount of the nanotubular titania materials used to modify the electrode. A half-life time of 13 to 15 min was observed for the PSII/(TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrode under continuous white light irradiation, which is more stable than that of the PSII-modified ITO electrode (half-life time, 8 to 10 min) (Fig. 3f) and the PSII/mesoITO electrode (half-life time, 4 to 5 min).31 Although the reactive molecules produced by titania in the process of water splitting might degrade the PSII immobilized on the electrode, this hybrid electrode shows superior stability among the PSII-based systems reported so far, which might be due to BBY particle entrapment in the network of the three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical nanostructured titania-modified electrode and the absence of direct light. In order to further improve the stability of this photoanode, the layers of TiO2 nanotubes and PSII were deposited on the electrode alternately. As displayed in Fig. 3f, it is confirmed that the stability of the hybrid PSII/TiO2/PSII/TiO2 photoanode is substantially enhanced compared with that of the PSII/TiO2 photoanode with the same amount of PSII and TiO2 nanotubes on the electrode.
The presence of the soluble redox mediator can enhance the photocurrent responses significantly, because electrons transferred from almost all active PSII assembled on the electrode could be received by mediators.20 DCBQ with a relatively positive potential (DCBQEm = +21 mV vs. NHE)46 is most commonly used for this purpose, because it possesses a strong driving force for electron transfer to reduce DCBQ, and an enhanced photocurrent response could be achieved.31 In our study, electrons generated by excitation of P680 in PSII and transferred from QB or QA sites are accepted by DCBQ and delivered to the surface of the electrode by diffusion of the mediator. As shown in Fig. 4, the photoelectrochemical measurements were performed under irradiation by red light or white light in the presence of DCBQ as a soluble redox mediator. Under red light irradiation, the initial MET photocurrent response of the PSII/(TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrode (8.8 μA cm−2) is about 3.3 times that of the PSII-modified ITO electrode (2.7 μA cm−2) (Fig. 4a). It also indicates that PSII integrated into the (TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrode possessed superior photoelectrochemical performance in comparison with the unmodified ITO electrode. Moreover, a photocurrent response as high as 10.6 μA cm−2 was observed for the PSII/(TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrode under white light irradiation (Fig. 4b). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the PSII/(TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrode was determined to be ∼0.02% and 0.19% for DET and MET under white light irradiation, respectively. This indicates that the photon-to-current conversion efficiency of the PSII/(TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrode is better than that reported previously (Table S1, see the ESI†).32
 Fig. 4  (a) MET photocurrent responses of PSII and PSII/(TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrodes with 1 mM DCBQ in the electrolyte to repetitive illumination by red light (550 < λ < 800 nm, 10 mW cm−2) and darkness cycles. (b) MET photocurrent responses of PSII, (TiO2)5-NT and PSII/(TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrodes with 1 mM DCBQ in the electrolyte to repetitive illumination by white light and darkness cycles. A bias potential of +0.25 V vs. SCE was applied at 25 °C. 
The DET photocurrent responses of the PSII/(TiO2)10-NT-modified ITO electrode under red light and white light irradiation were observed to be 0.04 and 1.1 μA cm−2, respectively (Fig. S5 and S6, see ESI†), and the MET photocurrent responses of this hybrid electrode (4.8 and 9.2 μA cm−2 under red light and white light irradiation, respectively) were much higher (Fig. S7 and S8, see ESI†). For the PSII/(TiO2)20-NT-modified ITO electrode, the DET photocurrent responses of 0.05 and 0.7 μA cm−2 were recorded under red light and white light irradiation, respectively (Fig. S5 and S6, see ESI†). Besides, the MET photocurrent responses for this hybrid electrode were observed to be 4.1 and 7.6 μA cm−2 under red light and white light irradiation, respectively (Fig. S7 and S8, see ESI†).
The photoactivity of the TiO2(C)-modified ITO electrode was observed to be unexpectedly poor. Both the DET and MET photocurrent responses of the PSII/TiO2(C)-modified ITO electrode decreased in comparison with those of PSII or TiO2(C)-modified ITO electrodes under both red light and white light irradiation. Besides, titania nanotube arrays were also synthesized by a sol–gel method using porous alumina membranes as scaffolds. The diameter of the achieved titania nanotubes is about 200 nm, and the length is about 60 μm. PSII integrated into an ITO electrode modified with the fabricated titania nanotube arrays shows a relatively poorer photoelectrochemical performance with initial DET photocurrent responses of about 0.02 and 0.05 μA cm−2 under red light and white light irradiation, respectively.
It is indicated that the photoelectrochemical performance is closely related to the morphology of the titania materials used for electrode modification. PSII integrated into an ITO electrode modified with nanotubular titania materials derived from natural cellulose, especially the PSII/(TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrode, possessed superior photoelectrochemical performance (Fig. S9 and S10, see ESI†), which might result from its well-defined 3D hierarchical network nanostructure that is beneficial for the contact between the electron transfer sites of PSII cores on the BBY particles and the electrode. In commercial titania nanopowder, titania nanoparticles with a relatively larger size (25 nm) loosely aggregate without forming a porous network nanostructure, which is not favorable for the BBY particle loading and electron transfer, resulting in poor photoelectrochemical performances.
The conduction band minimum (CBM) position of titania is about −400 mV vs. NHE in the electrolyte buffer solution (pH 6.5). The proposed cascaded electron transfer pathway of the hybrid PSII/TiO2-modified ITO photoanode system is displayed in Fig. 5. Charge separation occurred in both PSII and titania under white light irradiation. The electrons excited into the conduction band of the TiO2 with holes were generated in the valence band. Meanwhile, the electrons were excited from P680+/P680 to P680*/P680+ under light with an energy of 1.82 eV,20 and then injected into the valence band of TiO2 from QA or QB donor sites with a very large driving force, leading to further charge separation in the TiO2. The possible cascaded electron transfer process is supposed to result in an obvious increase of photocurrent responses generated in the PSII/(TiO2)n-NT-modified ITO photoanode systems. The increase in the photocurrent under red light irradiation can be explained by the electrode morphology. The bare ITO slide without modification possesses a flat surface on which the contact between the active sites of PSII cores on the BBY membranes and the electrode is very limited. While, the TiO2 nanotubes on the electrode provide a larger specific surface area for protein loading and contact with the ITO slide, allowing for a further increase in the photocurrent.

As we know, LEDs can only be lit under enough voltage and current. For our system, a bias potential of 1.7 V vs. SCE was applied by the electrochemical workstation, and the potential difference between the two sides of the LEDs was measured to be ∼1.5 V which was close to the rated voltage. It is obvious that even with the bias potential, the bare ITO electrode and PSII-modified ITO electrode were not able to light LEDs (Fig. 6a and b), and the (TiO2)5-NT-modified ITO electrode can slightly light LEDs under continuous white light illumination simulating the sunlight (Fig. 6c). For the hybrid PSII/titania photoanode, the LEDs were almost dark before illumination, while after 400 s white light illumination, the current increased to 4.5 μA, and the LEDs showed obvious light (Fig. 6d). It also confirmed that the PSII loading has a significant impact on the photoelectrochemical performance of the photoanode system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to report that LEDs can be lit using the photocurrent achieved by the PSII-based photo-bioelectrochemical cell with the assistance of a certain bias potential, suggesting that this assembly strategy of hybrid photoanode systems provides a new route to convert solar energy into electrical power which can be further stored and applied in various fields.

Conclusions
We have successfully fabricated a hybrid photoanode system by integrating PSII into nanotubular titania-modified ITO electrodes for photocurrent generation. Titania materials with 3D porous nanotube network structures and controllable sizes were synthesized by using natural cellulose substances as scaffolds and then deposited on the surface of the ITO electrode. The 3D hierarchical nanostructured titania-modified electrode promotes PSII loading and facilitates electrical contact between the protein and the electrode, which further increases photoactivity with high efficiency and stability. It is worth noting that the superior photocurrent generated by the PSII-based hybrid photoanode system has assisted in lighting LEDs, showing a potential application. Further studies are underway to assess the effectiveness of the hybrid nanotubular titania-modified ITO electrodes in H2 generation by solar energy conversion and water splitting.
