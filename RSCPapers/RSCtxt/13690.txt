1. Introduction
Emerging demands for energy have driven the development of renewable energies (e.g., solar and wind energies) and the development of power-dense energy storage systems (ESSs).1 Particularly for ESSs, rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage have been regarded as the most promising candidates.2,3 Notably, electrolytes play an important and irreplaceable role in the successful operation of those rechargeable batteries.4–6 Nevertheless, most of the employed electrolytes, including traditional organic electrolytes,7 solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) (i.e., inorganic electrolytes and polymer electrolytes)8–10 and aqueous electrolytes,11–13 still face great challenges. Among them, the potential safety issues and poor electrochemical properties are urgent problems to be solved. For example, the catastrophic safety risks (including easy flammability, leakage and inevitable formation of dendrites) and limited energy density are the top two obstacles with regard to organic electrolyte-based metal-ion batteries.14,15 For solid-state batteries (SSBs), the low ionic conductivity and poor interfacial compatibilities between SSEs and electrodes always lead to unsatisfactory electrochemical performance, particularly at limited critical current density (the current density at which initial lithium dendrites form in a symmetrical cell).16,17 More seriously, as for aqueous electrolyte-based batteries, non-stable passive films between electrolytes and electrodes, attributed to undesirable side reactions,18 together with the narrow voltage window usually cause the limited rate performance and energy density,19–22 thus impeding their availability for practical application. To solve the above-mentioned issues, the optimization of the components of electrolytes can be effective, which provides great promise for developing high-performance rechargeable batteries.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), also known as a new class of porous crystalline materials, have been widely applied in multiple fields, including gas adsorption,23 chemical catalysis,24 and molecular/ionic sieving/transport.25 In theory, due to the intrinsically ordered porous cavities, a crystalline MOF lattice is beneficial for hosting multiple guest liquid/gaseous species and thus achieving desirable molecular/ionic sieving/transport properties.26 More recently, MOF-based electrolytes have been developed as a novel emerging hotspot on the basis of their insulating character and intrinsic features. The superior characteristics of MOF materials, including controllable chemical compositions, tunable porous structures, and unique surface functionalities, endow them with great potential for producing high-designability and high-performance electrolytes.27 Thus, MOF-based electrolytes possess obvious merits compared to other electrolytes, including (a) uniform deposition without metal dendrites via homogenizing Li ion flux; (b) enhanced electrochemical stability by regulating the solvation structure; (c) high selectivity of ionic transport due to the unique structure and functional surface. Briefly speaking, the modular nature of MOFs with regard to composition, structure and internal environment is powerful to pursue high-performance electrolytes for current rechargeable batteries.27–29
In recent years, MOF-based electrolytes have inspired research in both electrochemistry and materials science communities. Benefitting from the significance and great opportunities in this novel field, there have been many research studies focused on MOF materials, particularly after 2018. This review aims to outline the state-of-the-art progress of MOF materials in electrolyte applications, including MOF-based SSEs (i.e., ionic liquid (IL)-based SSEs, polyoxyethylene (PEO)-based SSEs, single-ion conducting SSEs and others) and MOF-modified liquid electrolytes (LEs, i.e., self-assembling free-standing MOF separators, MOF-based composite separators and MOF membranes as coating interlayers on electrodes). Recent advances and challenges of MOF-derived electrolytes for various battery systems will be comprehensively reviewed. The perspectives and suggestions to address current dilemmas and future directions of MOF-derived electrolytes are also highlighted.
2. Fundamental chemistry of MOF-based electrolytes
2.1 Advantages and challenges
As discussed above, MOF-based electrolytes could deliver excellent performance on the basis of MOF materials, as shown in Fig. 1. Their advantages can be summarized as follows: (a) the versatile components of MOF materials enable various applications of electrolytes for different types of rechargeable batteries (e.g., metal-ion batteries,28,30,31 organic batteries32 or metal–oxygen batteries33). (b) Ordered channels in MOF materials enable uniform plating processes of cation ions during the charging/discharging process, resulting in a stabilized interfacial layer and improved cycling stability. (c) Periodic crystalline structures with rich porosity provide homogeneously dispersed sites and well-defined pathways for ion diffusion, together with high surface area benefiting sufficient contact with other components, enabling the optimization of overall electrochemical properties (e.g., ion transference number and ion diffusion). (d) Tunable porous structures (particularly pore size and pore polarity) could serve as permselective channels for targeted ion/molecular sieves, suppressing electrode dissolution issues and solubilization of organic redox intermediates, as well as optimizing the solvation structure of electrolytes.26,34
 Fig. 1  Overview of advantages and challenges in current MOF-based electrolytes. 
Nevertheless, there are many challenges still existing in the synthesis of MOF materials for application in electrolytes.26,29 First, the high cost of tedious fabrication processes and expensive ligands are the top concerns. Thus, this seriously hinders the mass production and feasibility of MOF materials. Second, when incorporated into electrolytes, another concern in the application of MOF materials is the agglomeration of MOF nanoparticles due to the nano-effects, resulting in unsatisfactory electrochemical properties. Third, as for MOF-based membranes, it is still a huge challenge to obtain a perfect MOF-based membrane without any defects. This is because intrinsic material defects are harmful to ion diffusion, and unwanted grain boundaries could trigger the formation of dendrites. Last, the investigation of MOF-based electrolytes for rechargeable batteries is still in its infancy, as summarized in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, most of the studies mainly focus on the research of MOF components, synthesis methods and their structural characteristics. Note that MOFs possess different functions in various types of MOF-based electrolytes. Nevertheless, more attention should be paid on the battery performance, particularly on ion transport and the detailed operating mechanism. Therefore, it is of great significance to have a deep and systematic discussion for pursuing advanced MOF-based electrolytes.

2.2 Ionic conductivity
The ion transport mechanism of MOF-based electrolytes can be discussed from two aspects, as shown in Fig. 2. On the one hand, in MOF-based single-ion conductors, MOF materials without any ionic solvent intrinsically act as conductors to selectively conduct ions.50,51 Due to their inherent merits, such single-ion conductor-based membranes provide closely packed cation hopping sites along their ordered and periodic channels by storing a high density of charged species in a small geometric volume. Notably, a lot of coordinatively unsaturated cationic metal sites or functionalized cationic groups of MOFs without any solvent molecules can effectively anchor anions (Fig. 2a). For example, Park et al. reported that a Cu(II)–azolate MOF (MIT-20) with tubular pores and open metal sites effectively immobilized halide or pseudohalide anions, exhibiting free transmission of cations within the one-dimensional pores.52 Such a MOF-based electrolyte delivered a superior ionic conductivity of ∼4.4 × 10−4 S cm−1. Thus, the accessibility to MOF-based single-ion conductors provides new opportunities to develop novel electrolyte systems for rechargeable batteries. On the other hand, the ion-selectivity of MOF-based membranes with LEs or other conductors is based on the physical blocking effect.53

In detail, in these MOF-based electrolytes ionic transport channels are provided by organic LEs or other conductors, rather than by the MOFs themselves (Fig. 2b). Most of the MOF-based electrolytes are based on such an ion transport mechanism. The open metal sites or the functional groups on MOFs mainly ensure that the MOF-based membrane transport selectively screens ions.5 In addition, the superior intrinsic properties (i.e., ordered porosity and narrow pore size window) benefit a homogenous ionic flux, accompanied by uniform plating behavior and free of dendrites.50 The conductivities and transference number of MOF-based electrolytes are summarized in Table 2. It is clearly seen that the introduction of MOFs enables great improvement of transference numbers in most of the MOF-based electrolytes. Nevertheless, a detailed investigation of their functional mechanisms is further needed to achieve an in-depth understanding, particularly the effects on MOF-based LEs.

3. MOF-based SSEs
The application of MOFs in SSEs has become an emerging research hotspot in the energy storage field because of their intrinsic merits including (1) extraordinarily high surface and controllable surface polarity, optimizing the overall electrochemical properties of SSEs (e.g. ionic conductivity, electrochemical window and ion transference number).26 (2) Periodic crystalline structure with ordered channels, enabling well-defined pathways for ion transfer and uniform-cation plating/stripping processes.34 (3) Tunable porous structures (i.e. pore shape, pore size and pore polarity), enhancing cation diffusion and suppressing unsatisfactory side reactions. All the above super physicochemical properties elucidate the great opportunities for the fabrication of high-performance MOF-based SSEs. In this section, we discuss the significant milestones in detail and systematically summarize the recent progress in different SSE systems, including the IL-laded type, PEO-based type, single-ion conducting type and other types.
3.1 IL-laden SSEs
ILs have attracted considerable attention as novel green solvents in electrochemical devices (e.g., secondary batteries, capacitors and fuel cells). Their remarkable properties, including flame retardant ability, high ionic conductivity, and high electrochemical/thermal stability, are desirable for application in safe electrolytes.55 Recently, encapsulation of ILs into porous MOF materials has become an emerging research field for the development of new and environmentally friendly ionic conductors.56,57 Generally, MOFs behave as ideal outgoing reservoirs for ILs due to strong multiple interactions, including coulombic forces, van der Waals interactions, π–π interactions, hydrogen-bonding, and coordination interaction, since their small micropores and tunable host–guest interactions benefit controlling the dynamics of ILs.58 Thus, based on the rich porosity and high surface-to-volume ratio of MOF materials, IL-laden MOFs (IL@MOFs) could not only retain all the above merits of ILs without the risk of leakage, but also enable boosted metal-ion transport within electrodes through effective interfacial contact. In addition, employing IL@MOFs as SSEs allows for the selective bonding of ions because of their unique interactions, inevitably affecting the intrinsic properties (i.e., ionic conductivity and transference number) of such electrolytes.59 Note that the structure information of prepared IL@MOFs, sizes of ILs, pore apertures, surface polarity, and coordination conditions of MOFs are greatly meaningful when they are employed as SSEs in batteries.
Early studies mainly focused on the effects of MOF materials on the phase change behavior of the confined ILs.60 The highly designable properties in terms of the surface polarity and pore structure dominate the overall properties of IL@MOF materials. In 2014, Kazuyuki et al. elucidated the pioneering example of an IL ((1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide), EMIM-TFSI) within the micropores of a MOF (Zn(2-methylimidazole)2, ZIF-8) by a simple physical mixing and a following heating method (Fig. 3a).60 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis indicated that EMI-TFSA maintains liquid phases by a nano-size effect in the micropores of ZIF-8, which was also witnessed in solid-state 19F static NMR measurements (Fig. 3b). However, the presence of fewer ion pairs of EMI-TFSA triggered a poor dynamic process of the ions. In their subsequent studies, they proposed that lithium ion (Li+) cations diffuse through the micropores via the exchange of the solvating TFSA− anions, similar to the Grotthuss mechanism.59 Thus, a possible way of enhancing lithium diffusion is to employ a MOF with open metal sites as the host material for the IL, where the open metal sites could effectively anchor the counter-anions, accompanied by easier dissociation of lithium ions.5

Soon after, Wang et al. demonstrated a unique SSB system of Li||LFP based on ionic-liquid-impregnated MOF nanocrystals (Li-IL@MOF), where about 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in EMIM-TFSI was selected as the IL (Fig. 3c).35 Such a novel solid-like electrolyte delivered a high room temperature ionic conductivity of about 3.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 with an improved Li+ transference number of ∼0.36. The assembled battery with a ∼210 μm thick cathode with super-high active loading (∼25 mg) exhibited a high electrochemical activity and good capacity retention over a wide temperature range (−20 to 150 °C), delivering a reversible capacity of about 145 mA h g−1 (based on the mass of the cathode) at 0.5C (1C = 170 mA g−1) and 150 °C (Fig. 3d). Such a remarkable electrochemical performance could be attributed to both intrinsically high ionic conductivity of Li-IL@MOF and seamlessly connected interfaces with an effective 3D Li+ conductive network. Shortly afterward, regarding the above unique nanowetted interfaces, Wang et al. further introduced such Li-IL@MOF into Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) based SSBs as an assistant ionic conductor to improve the interfacial Li+ transport kinetics.36 The hybrid SSE demonstrated a high ionic conductivity of ∼1.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 with an excellent electrochemical stability window of ∼5.2 V. The integrated Li||LFP and Li||LiCoO2 (LCO) full cells delivered excellent cyclability with a capacity retention of about ∼97% over 150 cycles at 0.1C, accompanied by ∼151.3 W h kg−1 and ∼304.1 W h L−1 for LFP batteries and ∼196.9 W h kg−1 and ∼377.0 W h L−1 for LCO batteries (based on the electrodes and electrolytes), respectively. Furthermore, nanostructured MOFs with impregnated ILs were also successfully developed for polymer electrolytes (i.e., polyethylene oxide, PEO61,62), and as for multifunctional fillers, a detailed discussion will be given in the PEO-based SSE part.
IL@MOF-derived SSEs are also available for lithium–sulfur batteries. Chiochan et al. reported a MOF-derived SSE, based on a Universitete I Oslo (UIO) structure but grafted with a lithium sulfonate (–SO3Li) group (UIOSLi) and then integrated with a Li-based IL (Li-IL, 2 M LiTFSI in EMIM-TFSI), for lithium–sulfur batteries.37 The Li-IL/UIOSLi SSE possessed a superior room temperature ionic conductivity of ∼3.3 × 10−4 S cm−1. As shown in Fig. 3e, the polysulfide shuttle effect could be effectively restrained by its unique structure of Li-IL/UIOSLi SSE in the upper glass vessel throughout the 7 days of a continuous experiment, where the polysulfide species were held by a Li-IL “glue”, which prevented their diffusion through the UIOSLi framework. In the electrochemical tests, the Li||Li2S6 cell with the Li-IL/UIOLi electrolyte delivered a superior long lifespan with a high-capacity retention of ∼84%, corresponding to a low capacity-fading rate of ∼0.06% per cycle, as shown in Fig. 3f.
Presently, although IL-derived SSEs have been successfully synthesized, the research of multifunctional MOF materials for increasing battery performance is still insufficient, particularly under extreme conditions (i.e., low/high-temperature region). In addition, it is urgent to clarify the detailed ion transfer mechanism of IL-strived SSEs. Furthermore, some intrinsic properties (e.g., the transference number of Li+, viscosity and thermal stability) are needed to get deep insight, since they have a key effect on the electrochemical properties.
3.2 PEO-based SSEs
SSEs have been widely studied because of their ability to overcome the leakage and combustibility problems of LEs.63–65 PEO-based SSEs have been industrialized due to their prominent advantages such as easy processability, excellent mechanical deformation ability, and satisfactory electrode|electrolyte compatibility compared to inorganic solid electrolytes (i.e., NaSICON type Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP),17,66 garnet type LLZO,67,68 and sulfide type Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS),37,67,69). However, the low room temperature ionic conductivity (<∼10−5 S cm−1)70,71 and poor interface contact of PEO-based SSEs seriously hinder their practical application. There are many approaches to improve the ionic conductivity, one of which is to increase the current carrier concentration by selecting lithium salt with a high degree of dissociation, and the other is to reduce the crystallinity of the polymer matrix by adding a plasticizer72 or an inorganic filler.65,73 Intriguingly, MOFs are found to be effective fillers for PEO-based SSEs to enhance the ionic conductivity, compatibility, thermal stability, mechanical properties, and the lithium/electrolyte interfacial properties.26
Early studies mainly focused on the effects of MOF fillers on the ionic conductivity of PEO-based SSBs, but lacked research on their electrochemical properties. Yuan et al. pioneeringly proposed MOF nanoparticles as fillers in PEO-based SSEs to improve ionic conductivity.39 They prepared nano-sized (20–30 nm) MOF-5 (Zn4O(BDC)3, BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) by a solvothermal method and prepared a PEO/MOF-5 membrane by direct blending. This composite SSE delivered a high ionic conductivity of ∼3.16 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 °C, which was four times higher than that of the electrolyte without MOF-5 nanoparticles. The improved ionic conductivity was mainly due to the interaction between the Lewis acidic sites on MOF-5, the PEO chains and the lithium salt, which would improve the non-crystallization of PEO and increase the salt dissolution.39 Furthermore, porous MOF fillers could absorb the trace solvents and then form a facilitated passage for ion transport. These results verified the effectiveness of MOF-5 fillers in PEO-based SSEs; however, the battery performance needs to be further improved. Angulakshmi et al. also successfully synthesized PEO-based SSBs with UiO-66-NH2@SiO2 fillers.54 The PEO-based SSE with UiO-66-NH2@SiO2 fillers could effectively improve the ionic conductivity from ∼7.6 × 10−7 S cm−1 to ∼8.1 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 60 °C and effectively improve the Li+ transference number from ∼0.2 to ∼0.68 compared with the filler-free electrolyte (Fig. 4a). The Li||LFP cell with UiO-66-NH2@SiO2 delivered a rate capacity of ∼138, ∼96, ∼76 and ∼37 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, 1C, 2C and 5C, respectively, while that of the Li||LFP cell with the SiO2 filler was only ∼119, ∼64, ∼55 and ∼9 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 4b). This work proved that MOF modification was beneficial for the excellent performance of SSBs. In other representative studies, PEO-based SSEs with different MOF-fillers, e.g., UIO-66/Li-IL,46 Al-MOF nanorods,61 and ZIF-8,66 showed a similar tendency towards higher ionic conductivity. The exact performance depends on the intrinsic nature of MOF-fillers, including the morphologies, controlled porous structures, and designable components (including chemical compositions and surface polarities).38,70,74,75

Recently, a series of MOFs with different components, including magnesium–1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (Mg–TPA),74 magnesium–1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylic acid (Mg–TMA),74 copper–benzene dicarboxylate (Cu–BDC),75 zirconium–1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (UIO-66),61 an amine-functionalized zirconium-based MOF (UiO-66-NH2),54etc., have been investigated in PEO-based SSEs. For example, Mathew et al. reported Mg–TPA and Mg–TMA MOFs incorporated independently in PEO-based SSEs.74 The Mg–TPA@PEO electrolytes delivered a higher room temperature ionic conductivity (∼8 × 10−4 S cm−1), lower interfacial impedance (∼400 Ω) and a higher Li+ transference number (∼0.58) than Mg–TMA@PEO. The higher ionic conductivity of Mg–TPA@PEO might be attributed to the lesser amount of surface charges which could fasten the Li+ transport through the electrostatic attractive force. However, the deep reasons remain unexplained and there were no charge–discharge studies. Much more attention is needed on the effect of the metal centrosome of the MOF filler on the properties of PEO-based SSEs.
Most of the researchers focused on the effects of ligands on the performance through modified and optimized MOFs which were more effective than inorganic solid fillers. Huo et al. constructed dendrite-free PEO-based SSEs with a novel cationic MOF (CMOF) to immobilize anions,38 which delivered better performances than the batteries with inorganic solid fillers.76 D-UiO-66-NH2 was prepared by partially substituting BDC ligands, while Zr6O4(OH)4(BDC)6 (denoted as UIO-66) was chosen as the prototype MOF. After reacting with CH3I, a CMOF was synthesized through nucleophilic substitution of grafted pyridine N (Fig. 4c). The PEO with the CMOF (P@CMOF) demonstrated a high ionic conductivity of ∼3.1 × 10−5 S cm−1 (higher than that of the PEO with UiO-66-NH2@SiO2 from ref. 54) which was 8 times that of PEO without the CMOF, a high Li+ transference number of ∼0.72 and an excellent electrochemical window of ∼4.97 V, due to the interaction between the functional group of –NH2 and the ether oxygen atoms on the PEO. The high transference number was due to the high specific surface area of the CMOF (∼1082 m2 g−1) which could immobilize anions via charge carriers' electrostatic interaction. As expected, the Li||LFP cell delivered a high initial specific discharge capacity of ∼141.2 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and a superior long lifespan (300 cycles) with a high capacity retention of ∼85.4% at 1C at 60 °C (Fig. 4d). These studies provided new strategies for producing dendrite-free SSBs by the controllability and pre-designable functionality of MOFs.
In addition to their own modification, MOF fillers can also be used in conjunction with IL-based composite electrolytes. Xia et al. designed a new-type of ultraviolet cross-linked composite solid electrolyte (C-CSE), composed of ZIF-8, IL and PEO.62 The ZIF-8 established direct interface contact between the IL and polymer chains which could promote the Li+ transport (Fig. 4e). Modified with the functional MOF, the electrolyte exhibited excellent mechanical stability and electrochemical stability including a high ionic conductivity of ∼4.26 × 10−4 S cm−1, a high transference number of 0.67–0.68 and a superior Li||Li cyclability over 1040 h with a current of 0.1 mA at 25 °C (Fig. 4f). In addition, Wu et al. developed a novel nanoporous filler UIO-66/Li-IL.61 After combining with ∼40 wt% UIO/Li-IL, the PEO-n-UIO composite polymer electrolyte presented a higher ionic conductivity (∼1.3 × 10−4 S cm−1), higher transference number (∼0.26), lower crystallinity and more stable cyclability. There were also some research studies about other morphologies of MOF fillers, such as nanorods70 and nanowires.77
The PEO-based SSEs with MOF fillers are complex systems consisting of MOF fillers, polymer matrices, metal salts, liquid plasticizers or initiators. The mechanism of interaction between these components is not clear until now. The mechanism of the effect of morphologies, aperture, metal centrosomes and ligands of MOF-fillers on the properties of batteries needs further study. In this case, it will be difficult to achieve property-oriented rational and accurate design. Much more attention needs to be given.
3.3 Single-ion conducting SSEs
Single-ion conducting SSEs (denoted as SIC-SSEs) are a novel emerging hotspot due to their extremely small concentration polarization with the immobilized anions.78 The strategies for obtaining immobilized anions include (1) linking anions to the chain of polymers by covalent bonds; (2) linking anions to the inorganic main chain; and (3) adding a capturing agent to double-ion conductive SPEs.78–81 When most of the anions are immobilized, the cations are the only ones that can move and thus SIC-SSEs are obtained. This kind of SSE enables an enhanced ion transference number, reduced polarization, promoted ion transport behavior and long-term cycling stability.
MOFs with designable binding sites and structures are excellent platforms to construct SIC-SSEs. Lately, some functionalized MOFs were used to synthesize SIC-SSEs such as functionalized Zr-based MOFs,40,51,82 Al-based MOFs83 and Cu-based MOFs.50,52 Wang et al. pioneeringly synthesized single-ion Zn2+ SSEs with a fixed anionic microporous host and mobile Zn2+ ions which were modified with Zr-based MOF-808 ([Zr6O4(OH)4(HCOO)6(BTC)2]) nanocrystals.41 The brief preparation process and crystal structure of MOF-808 are shown in Fig. 5a. The single-ion Zn2+ SSE possessed a high ionic conductivity (∼2.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C) with a low activation energy (∼0.12 eV) and an extremely high Zn2+ transference number of ∼0.93. These improvements were mainly due to the highly concentrated Zn(H2O)62+ ions contained in the pores of the MOF host which could improve the nanowetted interface and guide uniform Zn deposition to form dendrite-free batteries. The Zn||VS2 cells delivered a reversible capacity of ∼125 mA h g−1 (based on the mass of VS2) at 0.2 A g−1 at room temperature with a superior coulombic efficiency as high as ∼99.7% after 250 cycles (Fig. 5b).

SIC-SSEs with functionalized MOFs are also developed for Li-based batteries. To date, Shi et al. have reported a SSE membrane with biomimetic Li+ channels from a Zr-based UiO-66-NH2 MOF.40 The structure of the electrolyte membranes mimicked ion channels in biological systems (Fig. 5c) and could selectively repel free anion moieties and transport Li+ through grafting MOFs with sulfonate groups into nanopore channels, which effectively promoted Li+ transport, enhanced the transference number (up to ∼0.74) and ionic conductivity (up to ∼1.38 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 °C). The electrolyte membranes (denoted as UN-SLi-EM) were composed of a modification MOF and polyvinylidenefluoride–hexafluoro propylene (PVDF–HFP). The Li||LFP full cell with UN-SLi-EM not only exhibited excellent rate performance but also presented excellent long-term cycling stability with a capacity retention of ∼80% after 3000 cycles at 5C (1C = 170 mA g−1), while the control exhibited a fast fade with a capacity retention of ∼31% after 1000 cycles (Fig. 5d). Xu et al. also synthesized a new anionic framework (MOF-688) by linking ditopic amino functionalized polyoxometalate[N-(C4H9)4]3[MnMo6O18{(OCH2)3CNH2}2] with 4-connected tetrahedral tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)methane (denoted as TFPM) building units through imine condensation, as shown in Fig. 5e.44 MOF-688 exhibited a high ionic conductivity of ∼3.4 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 20 °C, a high transference number up to ∼0.87, and low interfacial resistance (∼353 Ω) in the Li||Li symmetric cell. The initial discharge capacity of the Li||LFP cell at a current density of 30 mA g−1 was ∼125 mA h g−1 (based on the mass of the cathode). And the full cells presented a stable charge and discharge voltage over 200 cycles with a capacity retention of about 96% of the initial capacity at 30 mA g−1 (Fig. 5f). In general, the mimicked ion channels could effectively mitigate concentration polarization and reduce electrolyte potential drop particularly at high-rate operation. The functionalized MOF modified SIC-SSEs with immobilized anions would be of great significance to construct various ion-selective systems.
Research on the application of MOFs in SIC-SSEs is still in its infancy and there are only a few research studies in this field. The interaction mechanism of each component in the full cells with SIC-SSEs is not clear. The selection and design principles of functionalized MOFs which can be used in the construction of SIC-SSEs need further study.
3.4 Other types
The applications of MOFs in SSEs are not limited to the above. They can also be used in other SSE systems.40,42,84 Zhang et al. constructed a MOF-CN (the surfaces of MOF particles were embellished with cross-linking nodes) by cross-linking 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (γ-GPS) on UiO-66-2OH (Zr-based MOF), and subsequently prepared a free-standing membrane (SE-PMOF) through an in situ ring-opening reaction between a terminal epoxy group and an –NH2 group using the MOF-CN, poly(ethylene glycol)diglycidyl ether (PEGDE), and diaminopoly(propylene glycol) (DPPG) as raw materials (Fig. 6a).42 The in situ ring-opening reaction not only created covalent bonding between MOF particles, but also formed membranes that could be used directly in SSEs. The SE-PMOF showed a high ion conductivity of ∼2.87 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C with Zn(ClO4)2 as the ion source, low interface resistance and high ion transport number (∼0.8), which suggested that the designed SE-PMOF presented a high single-ion transport capacity. The ion sources Zn(TFSI)2 and Zn(ClO4)2 presented different ion conductivity, respectively, which revealed that the anion could affect the metal ion transport, as well. Such behavior implied that more electronegative chemical groups were beneficial for ion transport. The superiority of the PMOF was verified by a charge/discharge test of Li||Li and Zn||Zn symmetric cells. The superior Li||LFP cells with SE-PMOF electrolytes delivered high-rate performances (∼153, ∼150, ∼144, and ∼130 mA h g−1 at 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, and 2C, respectively, 1C = 170 mA g−1) and stable cycling performance with a capacity retention of ∼97.7% after 100 cycles at 0.2C at 25 °C (Fig. 6b). The Zn||NH4V4O10 cells with SE-PMOF electrolytes also delivered excellent rate capacity performance and cycling stability.

All the above SSEs with MOF fillers adopted a uniform mixing design. Furthermore, MOFs were also used in the SSEs with an asymmetric design. For example, Wang et al. designed a 3D asymmetric cross-linked network PEO-based SSE with a modified MOF (ZIF-8 nanoparticles with a size of ∼300 nm) layer whose thickness was ∼5 μm on the lithium metal negative side through in situ polymerization (Fig. 6c).43 In the case of Li-based cells with such asymmetric SSEs a high ionic conductivity (∼4.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C) and a high transference number (∼0.68) were obtained. The practical applicability of such asymmetric SSEs was demonstrated by electrochemical measurement in Li||NCM523 cells. The Li||NCM523 cells with a specific density of the active material on the electrodes of about 4–5 mg cm−2 at 0.5C exhibited a high capacity of ∼135 mA h g−1 (based on the mass of the cathode) and delivered a superior capacitive performance with a capacity retention of ∼95.6% over 100 cycles, while that of the control samples decreased rapidly (Fig. 6d). The rate performance of SSEs with ZIF8 was much better than that of those without ZIF8. The MOF layer could effectively inhibit the growth of Li dendrites because it could not only provide high mechanical strength but also regulate the uniform transport of Li+. The 3D cross-linked network could enhance the interfacial contact between the electrode and SSE which greatly reduced the interfacial resistance. This work provides new strategies to develop next generation lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy density and superior safety.
In addition to the above, derivatives of MOFs were also used in SSEs.61,85,86 Zhang et al. synthesized a kind of composite SSE containing MOF-derived co-doped hollow porous carbon nanocage fillers.85 The schematic diagram of the material synthesis process could be seen in Fig. 6e. The composite SSE delivered excellent performance with a high ionic conductivity of ∼1.91 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C, wide electrochemical stability (5.2 V) and moderate transference number of 0.5. The Li||LFP cells exhibited a high capacity of ∼152.9 mA h g−1 and ∼140.0 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles at 0.2C and 0.5C, respectively (Fig. 6f).
Although MOFs are successfully used in SSEs to increase ion transfer number, enhance interfacial contact and stabilize cycling performance, there are still many problems to be solved. First, the influence of the physical properties (crystal size, orientation, aperture, morphology and structure types) of MOFs on SSEs remains to be determined which may play an important role in understanding the effects of the structure on performance. Second, the effect of chemical components of MOFs on SSEs should be further studied. Existing research studies on MOF-based SSEs are mainly focused on Zn-based, Mg-based, Zr-based and Cu-based MOF fillers; however, the role of the metal centrosomes has not been well studied. The reported MOF-based SSEs are all proved to be beneficial to ion transport due to the interactions between the MOF and ILs or metal salts or the polymer matrix, but the interaction mechanism of the complex system needs to be further clarified. Besides, the electrochemical stability of MOFs in MOF-based electrolytes during cycling is still unclear. Compared with SSEs (i.e., polymer SSEs and garnet-type SSEs), most of the MOF-based electrolytes may possess relatively low electrochemical stability. This is because most of the MOFs may undergo irreversible decomposition or conversion and structural collapse during the charge/discharge processes which has been demonstrated in cathode/anode applications.87,88 Meanwhile, the high porosity of MOFs will induce the increase of contact area between the electrode material and electrolyte, leading to a low volumetric energy density and low coulombic efficiency.27 Such behavior is detrimental to their practical applications. In addition, the stability between the ligands (i.e., carboxylate groups,41 imidazole rings,89 aromatic rings,90etc.) and the lithium metal has yet to be confirmed. It is important to make a reasonable choice of ligands, such as a F-doped ligand,91 trifluoromethanesulfonyl group,51etc. Last but not least, the metal centrosomes with higher reduction potential (vs. Li+) in theory may be reduced and deposited before lithium metal during cycling. This may also lead to poor cyclability of cells due to the structural collapse of MOFs. However, there is no symmetrical research in this field at present. In short summary, more efforts are required to achieve an in-depth but symmetrical understanding of the electrochemical stability of MOF-based electrolytes during cycling.
4. MOF-modified LEs
Note that when ester-based LEs are employed in LMBs, they trigger severe safety issues, including explosion and fire by thermal runaway, persistent side reactions, and non-uniform Li plating/stripping behavior with the formation of detrimental Li dendrites.17,92,93 Moreover, serious electrode dissolution issues and solubilization of their redox intermediates always lead to the obvious deterioration of electrochemical properties in some LMBs (i.e., lithium–organic batteries,45 lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries,48 or lithium–oxygen (Li–O2) batteries33). The application of MOF materials probably improves the above issues by developing novel electrolyte systems for LE-based LMBs. Attributed to their intrinsically versatile properties, i.e., the plentiful cavity construction, MOFs with designed pore size could act as ionic sieves in their modified LEs, thus regulating the ion transport.53 In this case, MOF-based membranes are introduced into the current LEs, where the ion conductors are the organic/aqueous LEs rather than the MOF conductors themselves. Intriguingly, the open metal sites or the functional groups on MOFs enable the MOF-based LEs to selectively screen ions, thus improving the electrochemical properties of LMBs. In this section, we deeply discuss and symmetrically summarize the recent progress in LMBs based on three types of MOF-modified LEs, including self-assembling free-standing MOF separators, MOF-based composite separators and MOF membranes as coating interlayers on electrodes.
4.1 Self-assembling free-standing MOF separators
Despite the great promise of MOF materials, the fabrication of perfect MOF-based membranes faces a huge challenge due to a large number of interfacial voids and grain boundaries.94,95 The obtained MOF-based membranes with intrinsic defects cause inhomogeneous dispersions and large interfacial gaps, unavoidably resulting in the formation of a non-selective permeation pathway, thus further inducing dendrite formation in grain boundaries or deterioration of the electrochemical properties in full cells.18,53 Thus, it is of great significance to develop perfect free-standing MOF membranes as separators in LEs for high-performance LMBs.
Recently, free-standing MOF membranes were developed to optimize the Li+ solvation sheath for high-energy-density LMBs. For example, Bai et al. reported a MOF-modified electrolyte with integrated hydrophilic Cu3(BTC)2 (HKUST-1) membranes, where graphene oxide (GO) was chosen to uniformly assemble these MOF particles.96 Such a MOF-based host enabled “caged” electrolyte anions with a high transference number (∼0.7), facilitating a homogeneous Li-ion flux. The as-developed Li||LiTi5O12 cell with a high loading (∼10 mg cm−2) showed an excellent cycling life with a capacity retention rate of ∼95% and capacity fading as low as 0.0025% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 7 mA cm−2 in MOF-modified 1 M LiTFSI 1,3-dioxolane (DOL)/1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) electrolytes. Soon after, Chang et al. reported a CuBTC MOF with a 10 wt% polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) based free-standing film by a film-casting process in a 1 M polycarbonate (PC)–LiTFSI carbonate electrolyte (Fig. 7a).46 Thus, further concentrated electrolytes with a more aggregative configuration were obtained by depleting solvent molecules within the Li+ solvation sheath. The obtained 1 M LiTFSI-PC electrolyte based on a MOF free-standing membrane delivered a largely expanded electrochemical stability window (∼5.4 V vs. Li/Li+), improved lithium reversibility (an average CE of ∼99.0% over 1460 cycles) and was well matched with high-voltage cathode materials (e.g., LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) and 5.0 V-class LiCoMnO4 (LCMO)). As a result, the as-fabricated Li||NCM811 and 5.0 V-class Li||LCMO full cells possessed a high specific capacity of ∼171 mA h g−1 (based on the weight of the cathode) with a high energy density of >630 W h kg−1 (based on the total mass of the cathode and the Li-metal anode) and ∼140 mA h g−1 with more than 670 W h kg−1 after 160 cycles at 150 mA g−1, respectively (Fig. 7b). It should be noted that the cycled MOF could maintain its structural integrity, which highlighted the important role of the solvent depleted electrolyte in practical commercial-level high-energy-density LMBs.

Reproduced with permission from ref. 45, copyright 2021, Nature Publishing Group. 
The free-standing MOF membranes were also employed as separators for organic batteries. To minimize intrinsic defects, Bai et al. demonstrated a self-standing dense and monolithic ZIF-8 MOF–gel membrane (∼30 μm) free of a matrix or binders by a vaporization–gelation process for rechargeable organic batteries (Fig. 7c).45 Such a unique efficaciously integrated MOF–gel separator possessed high blocking efficiency and better sieving capability of dissolved redox intermediates than the conventional separators due to the appropriate channel sizes (∼8 Å) against target organic redox molecules (5,5-dimethyl-2,2-bis-p-benzoquinone, Me2BBQn− intermediates). With 1 M LiTFSI in DOL/DME (1:1 by volume) electrolyte, the as-developed Li||Me2BBQ batteries presented a sustainable electrochemical profile without noticeable capacity loss during the charging/discharging process (Fig. 7d). For long-life cycling performance, such a cell delivered a notable capacity retention of ∼82.9% with capacity fading as low as ∼0.008% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 300 mA g−1 (Fig. 7e). Thus, a superior MOF–gel separator with excellent sieving capability is beneficial to prevent the migration of specific organic intermediates between electrodes for high-performance organic batteries. However, it is still urgent to develop advanced technologies for fabricating high-quality pure free-standing MOF membranes because of the high requirements of durability and stability in a practical battery.
4.2 MOF-based composite separators
To date, the nature brittleness of MOF materials makes it hard to meet the current requirements of durability and stability in practical cell applications for free-standing MOF membranes. Constructing a MOF-based composite separator with both superior robustness and flexibility is greatly promising for their application in LMBs. Hence, various methods have been used to fabricate these MOF-based composite membranes, including vacuum filtration,48 electrospinning technique,97 and doctor-blading method.98 Nevertheless, it is urgent to develop facile, low cost and eco-friendly techniques for large-scale preparation of MOF-based composite membranes after taking industrial applications into consideration. In this part, we mainly outline the recent progress of functional MOF-based composite ionic/molecular sieves for rechargeable batteries (including Li–S batteries, zinc–iodide (Zn–I2) batteries, and Li–O2 batteries).
Functional MOF-based composite ionic/molecular sieves (i.e., separator with MOF@GO,32,48 MOF@PVDF–HFP,99 MOF@SiO2,100 MOF@carbon nanotubes (MOF@CNT),101,102 and MOF@graphene103) have been investigated for Li–S batteries. Note that Li–S batteries suffer from rapid capacity fading with a short cycle life due to the shuttling of soluble polysulfides (Li2Sx, 2 < x < 8) between electrodes.48 One of their major technical problems is to mitigate the shuttling problem. Due to their highly ordered pore structure with a narrow pore size distribution, MOF-based composite membranes can be employed as an ionic shield to effectively confine the migration of polysulfides. Innovatively, a Li–S cell was designed by applying a Cu3(BTC)2 (HKUST-1)-based MOF@GO separator in 1 M LiTFSI with 0.1 M LiNO3 in DOL/DME electrolyte.48 Such a MOF@GO composite membrane was obtained by vacuum filtration, possessing high efficiency in blocking polysulfides and remarkable stability (as shown in Fig. 8a). The working mechanism was based on highly ordered micropores of approximately 9 Å, which was significantly smaller than the diameters of lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn, 4 < n ≤ 8). The as-fabricated Li–S cell with the MOF@GO separator delivered a specific capacity of ∼855 mA h g−1 (based on the mass of sulfur) with a fading rate as low as ∼0.019% per cycle over 1500 cycles at 1C (1C = 1675 mA g−1, shown in Fig. 8b). Shortly after, He et al. demonstrated a flexible MOF@PVDF–HFP separator by using HKUST-1 nanoparticles as assembly units and the PVDF–HFP as a binder via a vacuum filtration method. The as-fabricated Li–S cell with such a MOF@PVDF–HFP membrane possessed a much higher reversible capacity of ∼802 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles than that with a routine polypropylene (PP) separator in 1 M LiTFSI with 0.2 wt% LiNO3 in DOL/DME electrolyte.99 Soon after, UiO-66-NH2@SiO2 coated membranes were employed as a separator with 1 M LiTFSI in DOL and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) (1:1 by volume) electrolytes in Li–S cells.100 Such a unique separator possessed not only enhanced thermal stability and wettability but also improved electrochemical properties, which could be attributed to the complementary interactions between the MOF and polysulfides. The assembled Li–S cells with the UiO-66-NH2@SiO2-coated membranes exhibited a higher discharge capacity of 1400 mA h g−1 and a higher capacity retention of 98.5% after 40 h of storage than the cells with uncoated ones showing a discharge capacity of 910 mA h g−1 and a capacity retention of 86%. Intriguingly, Hong et al. reported cerium-based MOF@CNTs as an efficient separator coating catalyzing the conversion of polysulfides. A superior Li–S cell with a high sulfur loading (∼6 mg cm−2) still delivered an initial specific capacity of ∼993.5 mA h g−1 at 0.1C in 1 M LiTFSI and 0.1 M LiNO3 in 1:1 (v/v) DOL/DME electrolyte.101 Notably, the pores or the grain boundaries in MOFs may also allow the diffusion of polysulfides. Li et al. performed a comparative study for several commonly used MOF-based separators in Li–S cells.102 Based on the mechanism analysis of mitigating polysulfide diffusion, they proposed that the aggregation (packing) morphology of MOF particles played more important roles than the internal cavity size in MOFs. It is noteworthy that the strong chemical interactions of the MOF (i.e., formation of Cu–S bonds between the vacancies of copper metal sites in HKUST-1 and polysulfides) resulted in the irreversible loss of polysulfide intermediates.48 Thus, a pre-sulfurization treatment of MOF materials may be effective to solve the above issues.

Inspired by the well-known separation property of MOF-based membranes for gas or molecular separation, functional MOF-based ionic sieve membranes are also developed for rechargeable batteries. As shown in Fig. 8c, Yang et al. demonstrated a multifunctional MOF-based ionic sieve membrane for aqueous Zn–I2 batteries.47 Raman analysis indicated that such a Zn–BTC (Zn3(BTC)2) MOF-based interlayer effectively suppressed the shuttling of I3− and alleviated deleterious side reactions on the Zn anode. In addition, the channel in the Zn–BTC MOF enabled a unique electrolyte structure with more aggregative ion associations than in a saturated electrolyte. The as-developed Zn–I2 batteries in 2 M ZnSO4 electrolyte delivered a specific capacity of ∼85.1 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of ∼84.6% at 1920 mA g−1 over 6000 cycles (Fig. 8d). Furthermore, a novel HKUST-1 MOF-based separator was employed as redox mediator (RM) molecular sieves to restrain the shuttling in a Li–O2 battery.33 The optimized scheme of MOF-based composite membranes for RM molecules is shown in Fig. 8e. The MOF-based separator was harvested after the in situ growth of MOF particles onto the as-prepared Celgard separator and then a certain amount of polymer solution was filtered through the MOF-layer. The as-fabricated Li–O2 cell presented a prolonged cycling life of 100 cycles with ∼5000 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 in a dual redox mediator (2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DBBQ, discharging redox mediator) and tetrathiafulvalene (TTF, charging redox mediator)) electrolyte. Moreover, the fabricated Li–O2 pouch cell with the flexible MOF-based separator provided great promise for the development of large-scale energy storage devices.
4.3 MOF membranes as coating interlayers on electrodes
Besides the application as MOF-based separators, MOF membranes could also regulate the cation solvation sheath and further control the transport and reaction process when acting as coating interlayers on electrodes.30,49,100,104 Such excellent coating interlayers could be seen as an effective artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, possessing both high ionic conductivity and cation transference number as well as electrochemical stability and ease of integration. In this section, we mainly summarize the operating mechanism and recent progress of MOF coating interlayers on electrodes in rechargeable batteries (including Li- and Zn-based batteries), based on the regulated solvation structure of electrolytes.104
Note that high-performance LMBs are significantly limited by unregulated ion transport and reaction. Coating an ion-transport rectifier on electrodes is an effective way to improve the above issues. Recently, Xu et al. proposed a new strategy to modulate the electrode–electrolyte interphase via drop casting a suspension of UiO-66 MOF nanoparticles in DME on Li foil (Fig. 9a).104 The obtained-MOF coating layer (∼8 μm) possessed a preferred Li+ transport interphase by fixing PF6− anions upon adding 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) LEs. With lean electrolyte (∼2.3 μL mA h−1), the as-developed Li||LCO cells delivered a longer life-span with a UiO-66-coated Li metal anode than that with the pristine one, indicating that the MOF coating effectively suppressed the parasitic reactions between the Li anode and electrolytes (Fig. 9b). Such a novel strategy could also be widely applied to other energy-storage systems, e.g., rechargeable Zn-based batteries. Yang et al. developed a novel front surface layer to maintain a super-saturated electrolyte layer on Zn anodes by a ZIF-7 MOF coating.30 The optimized schematic illustration for regulating the solvation structure is shown in Fig. 9c, where the MOF layer rejected a large fraction of water via partial desolvation in advance. The as-fabricated Zn||MnO2 cells possessed ∼186.7 mA h g−1 (based on the mass of MnO2) with a capacity retention rate of ∼94.4% over 180 cycles at 500 mA g−1 in 2 M ZnSO4 + 0.2 M MnSO4 aqueous electrolytes (Fig. 9d). Furthermore, a MOF coating on cathode electrodes was also demonstrated to be effective to optimize the solvation structure of electrolytes. Chang et al. developed a new “Li+ de-solvated ether-based electrolyte” by mechanically coating NCM811 with a ZIF-7 MOF (∼2.9 Å) layer.49 Inspiringly, the “Li+ de-solvated electrolyte” presented an extended electrochemical window (∼4.5 V) compared to liquid ether-based electrolytes (Fig. 9e). The as-developed Li||NCM811 cell delivered a high initial discharge capacity of ∼186 mA h g−1 (based on the mass of NCM811) and a retained capacity of ∼140 mA h g−1 over 830 cycles in 1 M LiTFSI DOL/DME electrolyte (Fig. 9f). It is noted that such excellent properties benefit from a unique cathode–electrolyte interface (CEI) layer on the cycled NCM811 surface in the “Li+ de-solvated electrolyte”. In short summary, the promising role of MOF is highlighted in realizing tunable ion transport, which would be highly available for energy-storing devices.

5. Summary and outlook

For most of the MOF-based SSEs (including the IL-laded type, PEO-based type, and single-ion conducting type), the transference numbers and ionic conductivities can be improved by optimizing the structure of MOF fillers, functionalizing MOF materials to improve the surface properties, and optimizing the interaction relationship between components. Specifically, the IL-laded type SSEs have a wider working temperature window (−20–150 °C) due to the nonflammability and nonvolatility of ILs. However, the transference numbers of the IL-laded type SSEs still need to be optimized. The high manufacturing cost of IL-laded type SSEs is still a challenge for industry application. As for PEO-based SSEs, their high flexibility is beneficial for large-scale industrial production. The low oxidation potential and low ionic conductivity at room temperature need further improvement to achieve their application in high-voltage batteries, under shade and at room temperature. As for the single-ion conducting type SSEs, the high cation transference numbers and high mechanical strength are helpful to suppress dendrite formation. However, the theoretical basis needs to be further improved to guide the design of MOF structures and promote their practical application.
There are three-types of MOF-modified LEs, including self-assembling free-standing MOF separators, MOF-based composite separators and MOF membranes as coating interlayers on electrodes. The open metal sites or the functional groups on MOFs with matched pore sizes enable the MOF-based LEs to selectively screen ions and provide a uniform ion flux, thus improving the electrochemical properties of LMBs. Although there have been many studies on the application of MOF-based membranes in Li–S batteries, Li–O2 batteries and other electrochemical energy storage devices, their practical application presents great challenges. The low mechanical strength and low flexibility of self-assembling free-standing MOF separators may worsen life expectancy and safety.
The current synthetic strategies of MOFs mainly include template methods,105,106 modulation methods,107,108 microemulsion processes,109 chemical etching processes,110,111 spray-drying methods,112etc. However, the large-scale application of MOFs is impeded by their high cost, complex synthesis conditions and non-environmentally friendly nature. Specifically, the synthesis process of high-performance MOFs is usually conducted under complex conditions (i.e., high temperature, high pressure, templates, surfactants, catalysts or organic solvents), which are not only harmful to the environment but also cost higher than those of commercial electrolytes. Some MOFs with special structures require specific technology and equipment (i.e., modulators, spray pyrolysis furnace) which further impedes their mass production.107,112 In short summary, the preparation of MOF-based electrolytes requires higher raw material costs and higher manufacturing costs than that of commercial electrolytes. It is highly urgent to develop high-economic-efficiency manufacturing methods with environmental friendliness for large-scale industrial application.
For the future research of MOFs in electrolyte applications, multiple strategies to achieve high-performance MOF-derived electrolytes are also proposed as follows:
(1) The influence of physical properties (i.e., crystal size, orientation, aperture, morphology and structure types) of MOFs on battery performances, particularly ionic conductivity, remains to be determined, which plays an important role in understanding the effects of structure on performance and is of great significance to guide the synthesis of specific structures of MOFs. For example, 2D MOFs are more suitable for fabricating self-assembling free-standing MOF separators, while 3D MOFs are more suitable for SSEs. Widely accepted mechanisms are developed to illustrate the improved ionic conductivity: the porous structure and unsaturated metallic center sites of MOFs can directly bind anions to facilitate ion transport. Besides, the same MOFs used in different systems may play different roles.54,100 More aspects of the corresponding mechanisms need to be studied.
(2) The effect of chemical components of MOFs on SSEs should be further elucidated. The metallic center sites of MOFs are beneficial to the improvement of ionic conductivity. However, the roles of different metallic center sites and ligands are unclear, particularly, in terms of interaction with other components. Theoretical calculations may be helpful to understand the complicated systems.
(3) The mass production of MOFs with low cost, and controllable structure and composition is another great challenge. Particularly, novel and efficient methodologies for fabricating SSE membranes and separators with MOF fillers need to be explored. The existing preparation methods are not only low in efficiency, high in energy consumption and expensive, but also involve the use of a large number of organic reagents which are harmful to human health and the environment.
(4) Although MOFs can improve the ionic conductivity and induce uniform metal ion deposition in different systems, the detailed ion transport mechanisms in MOF-based membranes or at the interface need to be clarified deeply.
(5) It is necessary to improve the stability of MOFs for resisting electrochemical and chemical corrosion in batteries. Developing high-efficiency synthesis methods or modifying MOFs can improve the stability to meet the requirement of high-performance batteries. In addition, much attention should be given to the electrochemical properties of MOF-based batteries.
