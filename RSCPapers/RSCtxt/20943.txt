    , Accepted 7th November 2013First published on 8th November 2013AbstractUltrathin polypyrrole nanosheets (UPNSs) were synthesized by chemical oxidation via organic single-crystal surface-induced polymerization (OCSP) using sodium decylsulfonate (SDSn) as a template. This process yields mass-producible, inexpensive materials that are suitable for flexible devices. UPNSs were deposited onto transparent, conductive oxide glasses for use as catalytic counter-electrodes (CEs) in dye-sensitized solar cells. These electrodes boast 94% transmittance against that of Pt CEs. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 35 wt%), applied in the vapor state as a post-doping process, was used to improve the catalytic activity of the electrodes. This treatment enhanced the catalytic activity of UPNSs by increasing their conductivity by 8 S cm−1, with a 7.4% increase in the level of nitrogen doping. The Tafel polarization and impedance results support the enhancement of catalytic activity due to HCl doping. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) employing the HCl-enhanced UPNS CEs showed a power conversion efficiency (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) of 6.8%, which is 19.3% greater than the untreated case and comparable to that of Pt CE-based DSSCs.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered as some of the most promising devices for harvesting solar energy since their invention by Grätzel and O'Regan.1,2 In principle, DSSCs comprise a photoanode, electrolyte, and a counter-electrode (CE).3,4 The reduction of an oxidized species in an electrolyte occurs at the CE, and the reduced species diffuses toward a photoanode to allow the sensitizer to be regenerated. The performance of the CE in a DSSC depends on its catalytic activity, conductivity and surface area, which influence the photovoltaic parameters such as current density and fill factor, as well as overall power conversion efficiency.5–7 Platinum (Pt)-layered transparent conducting oxide substrates are conventionally used as CEs in DSSCs due to their high conductivity and catalytic activity. However, the relative rarity of the raw materials and the energy required to fabricate these electrodes, either by thermal deposition or sputtering, make the mass production of Pt-TCO substrates cost-prohibitive. Therefore, the development of high-efficiency, alternative CE materials composed of low-cost catalytic materials is needed for large-scale manufacturing of DSSCs.8–11
Since the development of conducting polymers by Shirakawa et al.,12–14 several research teams have been studying and using conducting polymers for a variety of applications. One such application is as the catalytic material in the CE of DSSCs. The low cost, high conductivity, and high electro-catalytic activity of conducting polymers make them possible substitutes for conventional, more expensive catalysts.15–21 Conducting polymers with various nano- or microstructures may be synthesized by several methods,22 including the use of hard/soft templates23–25 and micelles.26–28 Jeon et al.29 proposed a novel method known as organic crystal surface-induced polymerization (OCSP), which uses organic crystals that are recrystallized in the presence of surfactants under the Krafft point. Various nanostructures can be obtained by OCSP,30 including ultrathin polypyrrole nanosheets (UPNSs), which have nanoscale thicknesses (50 nm) and sheet morphologies, using a sodium decylsulfonate (SDSn) template.31 This two-dimensional structure contains fewer grain boundaries. As a result, UPNSs boast less interparticle contact resistance and higher charge transport efficiencies than nanofiber or nanosphere structures.31 Moreover, UPNSs have a greater catalytic surface area relative to graphene, which has a similar sheet morphology. This is because the whole surface of a UPNS can act as an active site while a graphene sheet is catalytic predominantly at the edges and defect sites.31,32 Finally, in contrast to other nanostructured conducting polymer CEs, the nanoscale thickness and two-dimensional morphology make UPNSs highly transparent, with absorbances similar to those of pristine FTO glass or Pt CEs.33
In previous studies, post-doping with chemical vapors, including halogens such as chlorine or iodine, successfully enhanced the performance of CEs in DSSCs and resulted in increased power conversion efficiencies.16,34 Furthermore, a post-doping technique using hydrochloric acid (HCl) vapor was proposed as a means of increasing both transparency and conductivity. The current study describes the photovoltaic performance of cells fabricated using UPNSs as the catalytic material in the CEs of DSSCs and a post-doping process using HCl vapor as a means of increasing their catalytic activity. Using this process, power conversion efficiencies of up to 6.8% were obtained.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of UPNS
A schematic illustration of UPNS synthesis is shown in Fig. 1. Ionic surfactants were recrystallized by cooling to below the Krafft point, forming organic crystals (Fig. 2a). Since SDSn is an anionic surfactant, the organic crystals are negatively charged at their surfaces. Pyrrole (Py) monomers, which are positively charged in aqueous surroundings, are adsorbed and polymerized on the surface of the SDSn organic crystals. Polymerization is oxidatively initiated by the addition of FeCl3. Polypyrrole (PPy) chains propagate across the surface of the crystals, as is characteristic of the OCSP technique. However, monomers that could not be adsorbed to the surface of the crystals are polymerized in the bulk solution, forming amorphous, black particles (Fig. 2b). These are later removed by centrifugation. To obtain UPNSs, the SDSn crystals were dissolved with methanol and acetone. The total UPNS yield was ∼65%.

Morphology
The morphology of the UPNSs synthesized via OCSP on SDSn organic crystals is shown in Fig. 2 and 3. The OM image in Fig. 2c and the TEM image in Fig. 2d show a single sheet of UPNS. It is rectangular with a width of ∼5 to 10 μm, a length greater than 20 μm and a thickness of 50 nm.31 The actual sizes of these sheets varied by a few micrometers. The AFM micrograph and the corresponding line profile in Fig. 3 indicate an average thickness of 378 nm and surface roughness of 44 nm. In contrast to a previous report,31 the UPNSs fabricated using the above process were relatively rough due to the multilayered sheets and the rough surface of the FTO glass substrate. The optical properties of pristine FTO glass, Pt-coated FTO glass, and UPNS-coated glass are shown in Fig. 4. The pristine FTO glass and the Pt-coated substrate exhibited a similar level of transparency at a glance, although the Pt-coated substrate was slightly more shaded upon closer inspection. The UPNS sample was transparent grey. The transmittance of the Pt CE was 60.2–71.0% at 500–700 nm. The UPNS CE exhibited a transparency 94% that of Pt CE over the visible range (Table 1).

Post-doping by HCl vapor

Fig. 5a shows the electrical conductivity enhancement of UPNS afforded by post-doping treatment with HCl vapor. Conductivity increased moderately from 31 to 39 S cm−1 after 60 s of exposure to HCl vapor. But further treatment after 60 s, conductivity was slightly decreased or almost similar value. This effect was most likely the result of over-oxidation. Note that experimentally optimized post-doping with HCl vapor for 60 s will facilitate charge transport in UPNS by reducing the interparticle contact resistance.
 Fig. 5  (a) Electrical conductivity is shown as a function of exposure to HCl vapor. Nitrogen 1s (N 1s) XPS core-level spectra are shown for (b) HCl-treated, and (c) untreated UPNS samples. 
Further evidence of the increased catalytic activity provided by the XPS N 1s core-level spectra of the treated and untreated UPNS samples is shown in Fig. 5b and c, respectively. There are four noticeable nitrogen peaks. The predominant peak at ∼399 eV is correlated with pyrrolic nitrogen (–NH–) in the pyrrole ring.35,36 The lower binding-energy component, evidenced by a shoulder peak at ∼397 eV, corresponds to the imine nitrogen (–N).35,36 The higher binding-energy shoulder can be deconvoluted into two peaks at ∼401 and 403 eV, and corresponds to positively charged nitrogen atoms in the pyrrole ring, such as –NH+– and –N+, respectively.36,37 Based on these data, protonation levels at the nitrogen sites in UPNSs can be calculated in terms of N+/Ntotal.36,37 The N+/Ntotal ratio indicates the doping level because doped anions are ideally balanced by positive charges in the pyrrole rings. Therefore, higher N+/Ntotal ratios correspond to higher doping levels. The N+/Ntotal ratios of the treated and untreated samples were 22.2 and 14.8%, respectively.
Tafel polarization curves & cyclic voltammetry
Tafel polarization curves with symmetric cells are shown in Fig. 6a. These curves provide the exchange current density (J0) for catalytic actions.38–40 In both the anodic and cathodic branches, treated UPNS retained a larger slope relative to untreated UPNS. This implies a higher J0 in the former; i.e., an enhanced catalytic activity due to HCl doping. The Tafel polarization curves also provide information on the I3− limiting current density (Jlim), which can be expressed as: (1)where n is the number of transferred electrons, D is the I3− diffusion coefficient, c is the I3− concentration, NA is Avogadro's number, and l is the spacer thickness. Note that the treated UPNS yielded higher J0 and Jlim values. CV measurements were also performed using both the treated and untreated UPNS samples as working electrodes (Fig. 6b). The pairs of anodic and cathodic currents, corresponding to the oxidation and reduction of I−/I3−, respectively, are assigned to the redox reaction shown in eqn (2). The more positive pair corresponds to the oxidation and reduction of I2/I3−, respectively, and is described by the redox reaction described by eqn (3). I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(2) 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−(3)
 Fig. 6  (a) Tafel polarization curves and (b) cyclic voltammograms of untreated and treated UPNS samples. 
While the untreated electrode showed dull oxidation and reduction peaks, the treated electrode showed higher current densities in the I3−/I− redox reaction. Furthermore, the peak-potential separation, Epp, for the treated electrode was ∼1039 mV, while that of the untreated electrode was 1275 mV. The decreased Epp indicates that the catalytic activity of the treated UPNS was higher than that of the untreated electrode.
Photovoltaic performance
Current–potential (J–V) curves obtained for sets of cells assembled with different CEs and Pt CE based-cells are referenced. The photovoltaic parameters, including the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (ff), and overall power conversion efficiency (η), determined from these J–V curves, are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 2. Compared to the untreated cells, the treated cells showed markedly higher Jsc values comparable to those of Pt-coated electrodes. This effect was attributed to the higher doping level and the lower surface resistance, which resulted in a higher overall conductivity (∼8 S cm−1 at 60 s of HCl exposure; Fig. 5a). The ff values in the UPNS cells were lower than those of the Pt cell by factors of 5 to 7. These lower ffs indicate that the UPNS cells were slightly less efficient than the Pt cell. The reduction in Voc values in the UPNS cells ∼20 mV requires more research to understand. Overall, the Pt-based cells exhibited 7.8% efficiency. The HCl-treated UPNS cells boasted a 6.8% efficiency, 19.3% higher than that of untreated cells (5.7%).

Impedance data
EIS data obtained using symmetrical dummy cells, and the equivalent circuits for fitting the EIS results, are depicted in Fig. 8. The intercept on the real axis (high frequency) can be attributed primarily to the Ohmic resistance (Rs) at the FTO glass and the UPNS or Pt layer. The first semicircle (middle frequency) can be assigned to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and double-layer capacitance (Cdl) at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. The second semicircle (low frequency) can be assigned to the diffusion impedance (Zd) of the redox couple in the electrolyte. In this study, Rct of the treated and untreated samples were 4.4 and 90.9 Ω, respectively, indicating that the treated CE was much more efficient in catalyzing the reduction of I3−. As with the Tafel polarization data, J0 can be calculated via Rct in the EIS data. The correlation between J0 and the Rct is given in the following equation: (4)where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and F is Faraday's constant. Since J0 is inversely proportional to Rct, the order of the obtained J0 values is consistent with that determined using Tafel polarization curves. Moreover, the Rct of treated samples is even lower than that of the Pt samples (5.6 Ω), suggesting that the UPNS-treated samples exhibit high catalytic efficiency. The slight increase of 0.2 μF in the Cdl for the treated UPNS sample relative to that of the untreated UPNS may originate from an increase in the catalytic surface area due to HCl doping. Another contributing factor to Cdl may be an increase in the absolute surface area in contact with the electrolyte as a result of morphological changes. Hence, Zd values for the treated electrode (544.9 Ω) are lower than those of untreated electrodes (687.8 Ω), indicating more rapid diffusion of redox species at the treated electrode. Note that the high absolute Zd values observed with these samples can be attributed to the small pores inherent to the UPNS nanostructure (Table 3).3

Experimental
Materials
Pyrrole (Py) (Sigma-Aldrich, reagent grade, 98%) was purified by distillation under reduced pressure and stored at 4 °C. Iron(III) chloride (FeCl3) (Sigma-Aldrich, reagent grade, 97%) was used as an oxidant and filtered (Whatman, GD/X PVDF syringe filter; 20 mm diameter, 0.45 μm pore size) prior to use. Sodium decylsulfonate (SDSn) (Tokyo Chemical Industry, >98%) was used as received. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 Ω sq−1, 2.3 mm thick) was used as a substrate material. N719 dye was purchased from Solaronix and was dissolved in acetonitrile to 0.3 mM (Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.8%) to make the dye solution. A hot-melt sealing foil (60 μm thickness, Meltonix, Solaronix) was used to assemble the photoanode and CE. The electrolyte consisted of 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII, Solaronix), 0.1 M lithium iodide (LiI) (Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.999%), 0.05 M iodine (I2) (Sigma-Aldrich, ACS reagent, 99%), 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) (Sigma-Aldrich, 96%) in acetonitrile.
Synthesis of UPNS
A typical synthesis of a UPNS was described previously31 and is given briefly below. SDSn was dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water at 30 °C with vigorous stirring. The solution was cooled to 0 °C, yielding white, hydrated crystals of SDSn. After 30 min of stirring to stabilize the system, pyrrole (0.81 g, 12 mmol) monomer was added drop-wise to the solution. The solution was stirred for 30 min and a pre-cooled FeCl3 solution (24 mmol dissolved in 20 mL distilled water) was added using a syringe pump at a flow rate of 15 mL h−1. Oxidation gradually resulted in a black-colored mixture. This process continued for 3 h with vigorous stirring. The mixture was poured into 1000 mL of methanol to terminate the polymerization reaction, and the mixture was stored in the shade to allow precipitation. The precipitated mixture was vacuum-filtered at room temperature using an aspirator and rinsed with methanol and acetone to eliminate any remaining monomer, initiator, and ionic surfactant. The cake-like UPNS remained on the filter paper. A portion of this was dried in a vacuum oven (60 °C, 24 h). The remainder was dispersed in acetone to generate a colloidal coating solution.
Preparation of UPNS CEs
Prior to fabricating the UPNS CEs, substrates were pierced in two places for the injection of an electrolyte. UPNS CEs were prepared as follows. First, a drop of UPNS solution was spread across a water surface. Next, an FTO glass substrate was stamped onto the surface of the water such that the UPNS was adsorbed from the water to the FTO surface. To ensure experimental accuracy, each sample was prepared using an identical weight percentage of UPNS and volume of UPNS colloidal solution. This coating process was performed three times for each substrate to attain the thickness required for optimal catalytic performance. To improve catalytic activity, UPNS CEs were post-doped with HCl vapor. The UPNS-coated CEs were placed on a small dish, and the dish was floated on a sufficient volume of HCl in an airtight container. The dish was capped and stored under a nitrogen atmosphere for a predetermined time. Experimental samples are hereafter referred to as treated (doped with HCl vapor), untreated, or Pt (control).
Fabrication of DSSCs
For comparison, a conventional Pt CE was prepared by spreading a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (2 mg Pt in 1 mL ethanol) onto an FTO glass substrate followed by heating at 400 °C for 15 min. Photoanodes were prepared according to a procedure reported previously.18 The prepared photoanodes were immersed in N719 dye solution and kept at room temperature for 10 h. The dye-adsorbed photoanodes and various CEs were assembled using a cut Surlyn. An electrolyte was introduced through one hole in the assembly while a vacuum was applied to the opposing hole. Both holes were sealed after electrolyte injection. Symmetrical dummy cells were assembled using two identical counter-electrodes with the same composition used to fabricate the DSSCs.
Characterization
The electrical conductivity (298 K) of a pressed pellet of dried UPNS was measured using a four-point probe method (Advanced Instrumental Technology, CMT-100 M). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG multilab ESCA 2000 system) was performed using a system equipped with a twin-anode Mg/Al K X-ray source. The morphology of synthesized UPNS was probed using optical microscopy and a field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM, JEOL JEM-2000EXl). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra of UPNS, Pt CE, and pristine FTO glass, and the transmittances of the samples in the visible region were measured using a Unicam 8700 series UV-vis spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV; Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat) was performed in a three-electrode system with Pt/FTO and UPNS/FTO working electrodes, a Pt wire counter-electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode dipped in an acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 in the range ±1.0 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Photovoltaic characteristics of the devices were obtained from J–V measurements acquired using a Newport (USA) solar simulator (300 W Xe source) and a Keithley 2400 source meter. The cells were illuminated at AM 1.5 G, and the light intensity was adjusted using an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter to 1 sun of intensity (100 mW cm−2). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using an impedance analyzer (Parstat 2273, Princeton) at zero bias potential and 10 mV amplitude over the frequency range 0.1–100 kHz at 20 °C.
Conclusions
UPNSs were successfully synthesized by an OCSP process using an SDSn organic crystal as a soft template. Considering that conducting polymers have intrinsic color depending on the kinds, UPNS CE had high transparency which is attributed to its nanoscale thickness. Post-doping treatment with HCl vapor increased conductivity to 39 S cm−1, 26% greater than that of untreated UPNS electrodes (31 S cm−1). The overall conversion efficiency of the treated UPNS DSSCs was 6.8%, which is comparable to that of Pt-based DSSCs (7.8%). Diminishing bulk particles during polymer synthesis, and optimizing the coating method and electrolyte composition can further enhance DSSC performance. The relatively high conversion efficiencies obtained with treated UPNSs show that this low-cost material can be used in mass production applications. Furthermore, UPNS is suitable for flexible applications due to its high transparency, low temperature processing, and two-dimensional morphology. These same characteristics make UPNS an eligible catalyst for roll-to-roll processing of flexible electronics.
