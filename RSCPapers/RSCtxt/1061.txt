    , Accepted 27th January 2014First published on 28th January 2014AbstractThis work reports on the use of an internal electrostatic field to facilitate charge separation at inorganic–organic interfaces, analogous to those in hybrid solar cells. Systematic charge transfer studies show that the donor–acceptor charge transfer rate is highly sensitive to the direction of the internal electric field.
Hybrid organic–inorganic semiconductor materials, such as p-type conjugated polymer (CP)/n-type semiconductor nanoparticle (NP) composites, are promising for use in next-generation solar cells.1–5 By combining the complementary advantages of both CPs and NPs,6,7 these hybrid materials provide access to a larger range of electronic and morphological properties than do either all organic or all inorganic materials. Over the past decade, a considerable amount of research effort has been spent investigating hybrid CP/NP solar cells.8–10 The highest power conversion efficiencies8 (∼5%) reported for these hybrid devices, such as P3HT/CdSe NPs bulk heterojunction cells, are significantly lower than that for all inorganic devices and all organic devices, however. A number of workers have suggested that the poor charge separation and charge extraction efficiency may account for much of the reduced efficiency.2,11–16 Thus, it is important to understand and enhance interfacial charge separation dynamics at the organic–inorganic donor–acceptor (D–A) heterojunction, if the promise of organic–inorganic hybrid materials is to be realized.
Motivated by this challenge, this work explores the feasibility of incorporating an additional charge-separating electrostatic field (separate from the existing D–A energy offsets) to enhance charge separation and inhibit charge recombination for hybrid solar cells. It is well established for conventional p–n junction solar cells that the internal electric field in a depletion region can efficiently separate electron–hole pairs.17 As Sargent et al. recently reported for a p-type PbS-NP/n-type TiO2 device, an internal field created by minority carrier diffusion at the PbS/TiO2 interface can help separate charges in conjunction with the PbS/TiO2 D–A energy offsets.18 In addition, several workers19–21 have reported that ionic (i.e. charged) organic semiconductors, such as conjugated polyelectrolytes or ion-doped conjugated polymers, display enhanced charge transfer rates and the formation of charge separated states because of favorable ion–electron interactions. Thus, based on these previous studies, it will be interesting and beneficial to combine the D–A energy offsets and the internal electric field as mutually-supporting charge-separation driving forces in hybrid solar cells.
This work reports on the charge separation efficiency for a hybrid model system, which consists of electrostatic assemblies of oppositely-charged conjugated-polyelectrolyte donors and CdTe semiconductor-NP acceptors. The charge-transfer studies performed on this model system show that the internal field at the D–A heterojunction can provide an additional charge-separating force for hybrid solar cells.
By extending previous strategies for synthesizing water-soluble conjugated polyelectrolytes,22–24 we synthesized both anionic (−) and cationic (+) alternating D–A low-bandgap polyelectrolytes consisting of a phenylenevinylene donor unit and a diketopyrrolopyrrole acceptor unit (see Fig. 1 and ESI†).25 The presence of intramolecular charge transfer in their alternating D–A structure promotes electron delocalization, lowers the bandgap, and enhances light absorption.26,27 The anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes show similar absorption spectra in DI water (Fig. S4A, ESI†) and have similar average molecular weights (∼25000, see Table S1, ESI†). Such low-bandgap D–A copolymers are selected as the organic component in this study because their optical properties can be fine-tuned to match the solar spectrum and because their orbital energy levels can be adjusted to favor photoinduced charge transfer to other semiconductors.21
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures are shown for (−)PDPPPV and (+)PDPPPV copolymers. Prefix (+) or (−) means positively or negatively charged species, respectively. 
Based on previous studies,28 water-soluble anionic (−) and cationic (+) CdTe semiconductor NPs were chosen to be the inorganic component in the hybrid system (see Fig. S3, ESI†). Cyclic voltammetry measurements (see Fig. S5, ESI†) show that the CdTe NPs can form a type-II (donor–acceptor) heterojunction with the PDPPPV copolymers (Fig. 2 inset). Interestingly, the voltammetry results show that reversing the surface electrostatic charge on the NPs or the PDPPPV copolymers does not significantly alter their redox potentials, within the experimental resolution. Note that because the copolymer donor and the NP acceptor are both water-soluble, they can provide the opportunity for environmentally benign device processing conditions.
 Fig. 2  The steady-state absorbance (solid lines) and photoluminescence (PL, dashed lines) spectra for (−)PDPPPV (blue) and (+)NP (red) in DI water are plotted together for comparison. The energy diagram (inset) is determined by cyclic voltammetry for the HOMO and the optical bandgap to position the LUMO. Poly[5-methoxy-2-(3-sulfopropoxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene], denoted as (−)PPV, is a control polymer, vide infra. 

Fig. 2 shows that both (−)PDPPPV (blue) and (+)NPs (red) have broad absorption coverage in the visible range, which distinguishes them from the traditional hybrid D–A systems, such as P3HT/CdSe NPs. Here, the energy transfer between the (−)PDPPPV and (+)NP is avoided because (1) the intrinsic photoluminescence quantum yield of (−)PDPPPV is very low, presumably because of the intramolecular charge transfer character29 and (2) there is little spectral overlap between (−)PDPPPV's absorption (blue solid) and (+)NP's photoluminescence (red dash). These features allow one to exclusively study the charge transfer between (−)PDPPPV and (+)NP by photoluminescence (PL) quenching. The counterpart copolymer and NP with opposite surface charges, (+)PDPPPV and (−)NP, have very similar spectra (see Fig. S4, ESI†).
The data in Fig. 3A show that titrating a 3 mL pH = 7 buffer solution of (+)NP (absorbance ∼0.1 at 692 nm) with up to 20 μL of a (−)PDPPPV solution (0.5 mg mL−1) causes a 90% quenching of the (+)NP photoluminescence. The final NP/copolymer molar ratio is about to 1. Similar quenching data were produced by using 675 nm as the excitation wavelength for which only the (+)NP is excited (see Fig. 3B and reaction (1)). Given these observations and the band alignment (Fig. 2, inset), this strong quenching is assigned to hole transfer from the (+)NP to the (−)PDPPPV (reaction (2)). Similar observations and assignments have been reported for other hybrid systems.30,31 (+)NP + hν ↔ (+)NP(h + e)(1) (+)NP(h + e) + (−)PDPPPV → (+)NP(e) + (−)PDPPPV(h)(2)
Aggregation quenching is possible in this case because the opposite charges on the (−)PDPPPV and (+)NP drive their electrostatic assembly in solution.32 Thus, a control study was performed, by using a (−)PPV polyelectrolyte of similar molecular weight to quantify the extent of aggregation induced self-quenching. (−)PPV was selected because (1) it forms a type-I heterojunction with the (+)NPs that blocks both electron and hole transfer when only the NP is excited (see Fig. S5, ESI†); and (2) dynamic light scattering experiments show that the (−)PPV induces a similar NP/polymer aggregation size as the (−)PDPPPV for a given concentration (see Fig. S6, ESI†). The data in Fig. 3C show that (−)PPV quenches only ∼25% of the (+)NP's PL under the same conditions. This result indicates that aggregation induced quenching is not strong enough to account for the efficient quenching observed for the (−)PDPPPV/(+)NP assembly.
 Fig. 3  Panels A and B present the steady-state PL quenching results (normalized) for the (−)PDPPPV/(+)NP assembly at an excitation wavelength of 600 nm and 675 nm, respectively. Panel C shows the PL quenching results for the (−)PDPPPV/(+)NP assemblies at an excitation wavelength of 600 nm. The different colors of the spectral curves correspond to different amounts of the (−)PDPPPV solution being added into the (+)NP solution. The arrow shows the change in emission with amount added, from 0, 1.2, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, to 20 μL. Panel D presents the time-resolved PL decays (normalized) for (+)NP only (red), (−)PPV/(+)NP (green), and (−)PDPPPV/(+)NP (blue) with excitation at 660 nm and emission at 710 nm. The black curve is the instrumental response function. 20 μL of polymer solutions were added into the NP solution for the time-resolved experiments. 
Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy was used to probe the kinetics of the photoinduced charge transfer. By only exciting the NP, the data in Fig. 3D show that (−)PDPPPV quenches the PL lifetime of (+)NP more strongly than the control, (−)PPV. These results are consistent with the data from the steady-state PL quenching. Because of the highly non-exponential shape of the fluorescence decay laws, they were fit to a distribution of lifetimes. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows plots of the lifetime distributions for the PL decays and gives one short and two longer lifetime components. The short component shows a significant reduction after (−)PDPPPV is added. Based on previous work,32,33 the short component can be tentatively assigned to hole transfer from (+)NP to (−)PDPPPV, while the longer ones are assigned to electron–hole recombination. In addition, the hole charge transfer rate is estimated to be about 1010 s−1 (see Fig. S7 for details, ESI†).
Photoinduced hole transfer from (+)NP to (−)PDPPPV should produce the (−)PDPPPV radical cation, (−)PDPPPV(h), which can be characterized by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Fig. 4A and B show the transient absorption spectra for the (−)PDPPPV/(+)NP assembly, in which ground-state bleaching occurs at 550 nm for the (−)PDPPPV and at 692 nm for (+)NP, and a broad transient absorption centered at 910 nm appears. For the following reasons, this broad feature is assigned to absorption of (−)PDPPPV(h). First, measurements for the (+)NP-only solution show that (+)NP does not have transient absorption in this region, indicating that the feature at 910 nm must arise from the presence of (−)PDPPPV. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the kinetic traces monitored at 910 nm for the (−)PDPPPV-only and (−)PDPPPV/(+)NP solutions; and it is clear that the lifetime at 910 nm is much longer for (−)PDPPPV/(+)NP assembly than for the (−)PDPPPV-only sample. This result suggests that additional pathways exist in the (−)PDPPPV/(+)NP assembly to generate (−)PDPPPV(h), presumably the donor–acceptor charge transfer. Note that several groups have reported transient absorption over this spectral region for other D–A copolymer radical cations.34–36 Last, this assignment is confirmed by spectroelectrochemistry. The spectra in Fig. 4C show a similar absorption feature arising in the NIR region as a (−)PDPPPV film is electrochemically oxidized to produce (−)PDPPPV(h). The data in Fig. 4D show that the broad feature at 910 nm cannot be attributed to the (−)PDPPPV radical anion ((−)PDPPPV(e)), because it only absorbs weakly around 400 nm and not in the near-IR.
 Fig. 4  Panels A and B show the visible and NIR transient absorption spectra for (−)PDPPPV/(+)NP assemblies recorded at four different delay times. Panels C and D show the spectroelectrochemical spectra for the oxidized and reduced (−)PDPPPV drop-cast films as the voltage changes with an increment of 0.2 V. 
Note that the excitation wavelength used in this measurement is 387 nm, where both (−)PDPPPV and (+)NP are excited. Thus, (−)PDPPPV(h) can be generated in two possible ways. One is by hole transfer from the valence band of (+)NP to that of (−)PDPPPV, and the other one is by electron transfer from the conduction band of (−)PDPPPV to that of (+)NP. The limited range of wavelength for the excitation prevented us from distinguishing these two processes by only exciting the (+)NP. However, the PL quenching data suggest that the hole transfer process does not strongly depend on the excitation wavelength (see Fig. 3). Note that for a similar hybrid copolymer–NP system, Ginger et al.37,38 have reported that the transient concentration of the copolymer radical cations does not change significantly with excitation of the NP versus the NP and polymer. Thus, it is likely that hole transfer from (+)NP to (−)PDPPPV is the primary process for the formation of (−)PDPPPV(h).

Fig. 5 shows the steady-state and time-resolved PL quenching results for the assembly of (+)PDPPPV/(−)NP with reversed surface charge. In sharp contrast to the (−)PDPPPV/(+)NP assemblies, only a weak PL quenching was observed for the (−)NP solution when (+)PDPPPV was added. The solution conditions and concentrations were controlled so that the PDPPPV/NP assemblies have similar Zeta-potential magnitudes (see Table S2, ESI†) and aggregation sizes (see Fig. S6, ESI†). These data suggest that the difference in PL quenching between the two PDPPPV/NP combinations is not caused by differences in electrostatic aggregation or polymer/NP molar ratio in the aggregate. Note that the intrinsic decay rate of the NPs can change somewhat between batches, and this was accounted for by control experiments (see ESI† for more discussion).
 Fig. 5  Panels A and B show the steady-state and time-resolved PL quenching results for the (+)PDPPPV/(−)NP assembly. These two measurements were performed under the same condition as those in Fig. 3. 
The difference in the quenching kinetics correlates with the different internal electric field direction between the oppositely charged NP and PDPPPV in these two systems (see Fig. 6). For instance, the (−)PDPPPV/(+)NP assembly should have a favorable internal electric field that drives the hole transfer from (+)NP to (−)PDPPPV in the same direction as the valence band energy offsets. Note that the energy levels in Fig. 6 are for separated polymers and NPs, and further studies are needed to determine their relative energetics in the electrostatic aggregates. Upon reversing the surface charge on both NP and PDPPPV, i.e., (+)PDPPPV/(−)NP, no observable hole transfer is found, because their internal electric field is oriented in the other direction. Hence, generally speaking, a (−) electron donor and a (+) electron acceptor can generate an internal electric field that favors charge separation. This observation agrees well with the previous findings for a NP/NP donor–acceptor system.32 In that case, the charge transfer was found to be very efficient when a (−)NP electron donor and (+)NP electron acceptor was used, but not with reversed surface charges on both NPs. The current work extends this approach to NP–polymer hybrid systems, and suggests its use for enhancing the charge separation efficiency for hybrid solar cells.

Conclusions
In summary, this work has demonstrated that charge transfer for a hybrid conjugated-polyelectrolyte/semiconductor-nanoparticle model system is strongly affected by the direction of the internal electrostatic field, and that one can use this field to manipulate the hole transfer rate in the polyelectrolyte/NP electrostatic assemblies. Incorporation of an internal field may facilitate the exciton dissociation and ultimately improve charge separation efficiency at inorganic–organic interfaces of hybrid solar cell devices. Thus, this work suggests a new strategy that can promote charge separation and inhibit charge recombination for hybrid solar cells.
