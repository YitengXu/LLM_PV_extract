    , Accepted 22nd December 2010First published on 7th February 2011AbstractNovel large-scale ordered Y2O3:Er3+ porous pyramid arrays are synthesized on glass substrates, based on a simple and flexible method using the layer colloidal crystal with different sizes of polystyrene colloidal microsphere as templates. Such arrays exhibit bifunctionality, i.e., superior broadband antireflection in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 1100 nm, and intense red and infrared emissions under 1.538 μm excitation. The morphologies and transmission ratio of the resulting arrays can be controlled by adjusting micropore diameter sizes of the arrays from 305 nm to 795 nm. The intensities of red and infrared emissions are enhanced respectively 19 and 3 times by tailoring Er3+ ions' local environment with Li+.
I. Introduction
In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in exploring how to minimize reflection loss and infrared transmission loss of solar cells to increase photovoltaic conversion efficiency.1 Some so-called moth-eye antireflective coatings and light trapping structures,2 such as GaSb nipple arrays, Si nipple arrays, and hot-embossed PVC film, have been fabricated to reduce the reflection of sunlight. Shalav and Trupke put NaYF4:Er3+ upconversion materials on the rear side of c-Si solar cells and successfully recycled sub-bandgap loss.3 However, the moth-eye anti-reflection patterns can not recycle sub-bandgap loss simultaneously even though the reflection loss can be reduced in wide wavelength range. It is well-known that c-Si solar cells lose at least 20% of the incident radiation power because some infrared photons below the bandgap are transmitted and cause sub-bandgap loss.4 Recycling sub-bandgap loss by single-layer antireflective coating becomes a challenge to realize a promising result in which both reflection loss and sub-bandgap loss are minimized simultaneously.
Our strategy to solve the above-mentioned problem focuses on doping trivalent rare-earth ions as optical active center into the light trapping structure to absorb infrared photons (λ > 1100 nm) and up-convert them into visible-infrared ones (400 nm < λ < 1100 nm) absorbed by c-Si solar cells. Er3+ ion is thought of as an efficient upconversion ion, due to its higher luminescent efficiency and wide absorption cross section in infrared regions.5 Pyramid arrays are excellent light trapping structures and can greatly reduce reflection by creating a refractive index gradient across the interface between air and arrays and successively reflect incident light.6 Recently, ordered porous structures have received much attention due to their great potential applications such as in photonic band-gap crystals, catalysis, adsorbents, separation fields and use as low dielectric constant materials.7 The ordered porous structure is suitable to trap incident light as an anti-reflection coating, because refractive index gradient is apt to be constructed among the air, nanoparticles, and substrate. Thus, Er3+ doped porous pyramid arrays are expected both to have a light trapping effect and to up-convert infrared photons to visible-infrared ones in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 1100 nm.

        Y2O3 is an important industrial compound widely used in antireflective coatings and transparent ceramics,8,9 due to its broad transparency range (0.2–8μm), high refractive index, and high chemical and thermal stability. Y2O3 is also reported to be a promising host material for Er3+, because Er2O3 and Y2O3 have similar crystal structures and Y3+ and Er3+ have nearly the same ionic radii.10 Thus, in this paper, Y2O3:Er3+ porous pyramid arrays with a honeycomb micropore structure are synthesized on glass substrates and their optical characteristics are investigated.
II. Experimental
Synthesis of ordered Y2O3:Er3+ porous pyramid arrays
A typical procedure of polystyrene colloidal microsphere template technology for preparing Y2O3:5% Er3+ porous pyramid arrays is as follows: quartz glass slides were washed with acetone, ethanol, and distilled water in an ultrasonic bath and then in turn cleaned in 98% H2SO4/H2O2 (3:1 in volume), H2O/NH3·H2O–H2O2 (5:1:1 in volume), and distilled water, respectively. Ordered polystyrene colloidal layer microspheres with different diameters (500 nm or 1000 nm) were synthesized by the spin-coating method on a custom-built spin coater using the polystyrene colloidal microspheres (Alfa Aesar company). The colloidal layer was then lifted off from the glass substrate and floated on the surface of deionized water. Next, the layer was picked up with a desired quartz glass substrate and heated at 80 °C for 0.5 h in an oven. Subsequently, the rare earth oxides Y2O3 (99.99%) were dissolved in hydrochloric acid (1 mol Y2O3:3 mol HCl). A YCl3 and ErCl3 mixed aqueous solution (95:5 in volume) was used as precursor solution. The precursor solution was dropped on the surface of colloidal layer polystyrene microspheres at a small inclination angle. After drying at 60 °C for 3 h, the quartz glass coated with layer polystyrene microspheres was heated at 900 °C for 0.6 h to burn the polystyrene microspheres away, leaving the Y2O3:5% Er3+ porous pyramid arrays. Other samples with different micropore sizes can be synthesized using a similar method.
Characterization
The surface morphology of samples were characterized by scanning probe microscope (SPM) in the tapping AFM (atomic force microscopy) mode (Veeco, Multimode NanoScope 3D). AFM imaging was performed under ambient conditions at room temperature (23 ± 2 °C) using a scanning probe microscope equipped with CCD camera. Structures of the samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Ultima-III (Rigaku) equipment provided with Cu tube with Kα radiation at 1.54056 Å in the range of 10° ≤ 2θ ≤ 70°. The transmittance spectra are measured by ultralviolet-visible-infrared spectrophotometer (SP-752) in the wavelength range from 200 nm to 1100 nm. Upconversion luminescence spectra in the wavelength range from 200 nm to 900 nm (from 900 nm to 1100 nm) were obtained by the Omni-λ3007 spectrophotometer with a photomultiplier tube (InGaAs detector). An infrared laser with the wavelength at 1.538 μm is employed as the excitation source. The dependence of upconverted emission intensity on pumping powers for different samples was obtained by changing the excitation powers. All spectrum measurements were performed at room temperature.
III. Results and discussion
Morphology and structure of the arrays

          AFM images in Fig. 1a–1e show the two-dimensional surface morphologies of Y2O3:5% Er3+ arrays with different micropore sizes formed on the glass substrate. It can be clearly seen that the ordered Y2O3:5% Er3+ porous arrays grow between two adjacent micropores that formed by three polystyrene colloidal microspheres. The micropore sizes D, such as 305 nm, 360 nm, 420 nm, 595 nm and 795 mm, can be controlled by changing four parameters, i.e., the spherical colloidal particles diameter, the reaction concentration of rare-earth ion solution, and reaction temperature and time, while keeping the surface chemistry unmodified. Fig. 1f shows the three-dimensional image of above ordered Y2O3:5% Er3+ porous arrays with D = 420 nm. The ordered Y2O3:5% Er3+ porous arrays shows pyramid structure with micropores in the center. The height of the pyramid arrays is in the range from 100 nm to 200 nm. The X-ray patterns of the Y2O3:5% Er3+ porous pyramid arrays are measured and show the presence of cubic Y2O3.

Optical properties
The effect of micropore diameter sizes on antireflection is studied through measuring the transmittance spectra of the Y2O3:5% Er3+ porous pyramid arrays with different micropore sizes, shown in Fig. 2(a). Most of the Y2O3:5% Er3+ porous pyramid arrays exhibit high transmission ratio in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 1100 nm. However, low transmittance ratio in the ultraviolet range is caused by the glass substrate. The transmission ratio can be controlled by adjusting micropore diameter sizes from 305 nm to 795 mm. The maximum transmittance ratio is reached for the Y2O3:5% Er3+ porous pyramid arrays with micropore diameter size around D0 = 420 nm (critical size). The Y2O3:5% Er3+ porous pyramid arrays with micropore size D = 420 nm shows the transmittance ratio increases from 87% to 96% with wavelength increase from 400 nm to 1100 nm, which strides across the intense spectral response range of c-Si solar cells.

The affect of micropore diameter sizes on transmission ratio can be explained as follows. At D ≤ D0, the incident light can be trapped by the adjacent Y2O3:Er3+ pyramids through creating a refractive index gradient across the interface between air and arrays and successively reflecting incident light. The incident light changes its direction by Y2O3:Er3+ pyramid because the light is reflected and refracted many times. The refracted light can penetrate the Y2O3:Er3+ pyramid into the glass, due to the broad transparency range (0.2–8μm) of Y2O3.8,9 The reflected light from one Y2O3:Er3+ pyramid can be refracted and reflected by the adjacent Y2O3:Er3+ pyramid many times, and eventually penetrates Y2O3:Er3+ pyramid into the glass. While at D > D0, the reflected light is not trapped by the adjacent Y2O3:Er3+ pyramids and is not reflected numerously by the glass substrate, and eventually disperses.
The luminescence intensity of the optical active center is dependent on the concentration of optical active center and the match between laser wavelength and energy levels of the optical active center.11 The micropore diameter size mainly affects transmission ratio, but hardly plays any role in the luminescence intensity of the optical active center. Fig. 2(b) shows the photoluminescence spectrum (PL) of Y2O3:5% Er3+ porous pyramid arrays (D = 420 nm) at room temperature under the excitation of infrared light at 1.538 μm. The green (521–562 nm), red (659–682 nm) and infrared (801–845 nm, and 920–1045 nm) emission bands are observed. The green emission is ascribed to 2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ and the red emission is ascribed to 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition. The infrared emission ranging from 801 nm to 845 nm is ascribed to 4I9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+. The strong infrared emission ranging from 920 nm to 1042 nm is ascribed to 4I11/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+. Above visible and infrared emissions of the Er3+ fall well within the intense spectral response spectrum of c-Si solar cells, suggesting that sub-bandgap infrared light around 1.538 μm can be up-converted into supra-bandgap photons through a frequency upconversion of Y2O3:5% Er3+ porous pyramid arrays.12
The dependence of visible and infrared PL intensity on Er3+ concentration is investigated in Fig.3 for Y2−xErxO3 (x = 1%, 3%, 5%, 8% and 15%) porous pyramid arrays (D = 420 nm) at room temperature under 1.538 μm excitation with a pump power of 233 mW. The maximum intensity of green, red, and 920–1042 nm infrared emission bands is observed at 5 mol% Er3+ concentration. The maximum intensity of 801–845 nm infrared emission is observed at 8 mol% Er3+ concentration. An effect of concentration quenching appears when the Er3+ concentration exceeds 8 mol%.

Fig. 4 shows the visible and infrared upconversion luminescence spectra in Y2O3:5%Er3+ porous pyramid arrays (D = 420 nm) doped with 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 mol% Li+ ions at room temperature under 1.538 μm excitation with a pump power of 360 mW. The visible and infrared emissions intensity increase greatly with Li+ ions of 0–5 mol% then decrease at higher Li+ ions of 7 mol%. The intensity of 659–682 nm red emission band from the Y2O3:5%Er3+, 5% Li+ pyramid arrays is about 19 times greater than that from the sample without Li+. The intensity of the 920–1042 nm infrared emission band is about 3 times greater than that from the sample without Li+. The similar enhancement effect of visible emissions under 970 and 976 nm excitations has been also observed.13
 Fig. 4  (Color online) Measured visible (a) and infrared (b) emissions of Y2O3:5% Er3+ porous pyramid arrays (D = 420 nm) doped with various Li+ ions under 1.538 μm excitation. 
The enhancement of visible and infrared emissions can be explained as follows: the M2O3 (M = Y or Er) is a bixbyite structure and M is coordinated with six O in the M2O3 lattice.14 The optically active center of Er3+ (r = 0.88 Å) has a local structure of the ErO6 unit after the Er3+ is doped in Y2O3 lattice (the radius of Y3+, r = 0.89 Å). When Li+ ions (r = 0.68 Å) is doped into Y2O3:Er3+, Li+ ions may occupy sites in or near the ErO6 units or diffuse to various interstitial sites in the Y2O3 lattice, making the change of Coulomb interactions and Er–O bond slightly distorted. The Er–O bond distortion alters the local symmetry of the crystal field around Er3+. The intra-4f electronic transitions that are parity forbidden in principle become partially allowed, increasing the intra-4f electronic transitions probability of the Er3+ ions.11 The upconversion emissions of Er3+ doped Y2O3 materials originate from the intra-4f transitions of Er3+ ion. As a result, the enhancement of visible and infrared emissions is realized by tailoring Er3+ ions' local environment with Li+.
Admittedly, the upconversion emission intensity IUC is proportional to the Nth power of the infrared excitation intensity (pumping power) P: IUC ∝ PN(1)
where N = 1, 2, 3… is the order of multiphoton transitions being a number of infrared quanta absorbed per one visible photon emission.15 The excitation power dependence of upconversion PL intensity of Er3+ ions under 1.538 μm excitation is shown in Fig. 5. It is noted that, the slopes of green (521–562 nm), red (659–682 nm) and infrared emission bands (801–845 nm, 920–1042 nm) could be divided into two groups for the same transition of Er3+. When P < 105 mW (logP < 2.0212), the slopes of the linear fittings are 3.81 for 2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (521–562 nm), 2.95 for 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (659–682 nm), 2.61 for 4I9/2 → 4I15/2 (801–845 nm), and 1.92 for 4I11/2 → 4I15/2 (920–1042 nm), indicating that four pumping photons are required to populate the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 states, three pumping photons for the 4F9/2 and 4I9/2 states, and two pumping photons for the 4I11/2 state, respectively. While when P > 136 mW (logP > 2.1335), intensity saturation occurs and the corresponding slopes of the linear fittings reduce to 1.78, 1.65, 1.25, and 0.87, respectively. The numbers of photons decrease sharply when the excitation power exceeds some digital, owing to the competition between the linear decay and the upconversion processes for the depletion of the intermediate excited states.16

We refer to the energy schemes of Er3+ depicted in Fig. 6 to explain the upconversion mechanism under 1.538 μm excitation. The energy transfer between Er3+ ions is thought as the main upconversion mechanism, when the Er3+ concentration of optically active center is high.11 Under 1.538 μm excitation, the 4I13/2 state is populated by excited state absorption of a single Er3+ ion. The successive four-step energy transfer upconversion between Er3+ ions occurs when one excited donor Er3+ ion transfers its energy to a nearby neighboring acceptor Er3+ ion, raising it successively to six higher energy excited states, such as 4I13/2, 4I9/2, 4F9/2, and 4F5/2. The 4I11/2 and 4S3/2 states are populated through rapid multi-phonon nonradiative relaxations from the 4I9/2 and 4F5/2 states. The 2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions take place, giving green emissions band ranging from 521 to 562 nm. The 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition occurs, giving red emission band ranging from 659 to 682 nm. The 4I9/2 → 4I15/2 and 4I11/2 → 4I15/2 transitions occur, giving infrared emission bands ranging from 801 to 845 nm and from 920 to 1042 nm, respectively. In the above discussion on the upconversion PL mechanism, defect induced emissions from the non-equilibrium process could be neglected relative to the energy transfer between Er3+ ions,17,18 due to the good energy level match in the infrared absorption process of Er3+ ions.

IV. Conclusion
In summary, the ordered Y2O3:Er3+ porous pyramid arrays shows broadband antireflection and infrared upconversion bifunctionality. The Y2O3:5%Er3+ porous pyramid arrays (D = 420 nm) show the transmittance ratio increases from 87% to 96% in wavelength range from 300 nm to 1100 nm. By introducing Li+ ions, the intensities of red and infrared emission bands are enhanced about 19 and 3 times when compared the Y2O3:5%Er3+, 5%Li+ with the Y2O3:5%Er3+ porous pyramid arrays. The main upconversion mechanism for visible and infrared emissions is thought of as a successive four-step energy transfer between Er3+ ions. The Y2O3:5%Er3+, 5%Li+ porous pyramid arrays have potential application in decreasing the reflection and transmission loss for C–Si solar cells.
