    , Accepted 20th August 2015First published on 20th August 2015AbstractCarbon nanodots treated with N2-plasma are effective catalysts for solar-driven hydrogen-evolved-reaction on np+-Si photocathodes and a support for Pt allowing for the reduction in Pt loading by a factor of about 3.5 while improving the photoelectrochemical activity.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting that converts intermittent solar radiation into hydrogen fuel is a potential processing route to solve the energy problem since hydrogen can be captured and utilized as a clean burning fuel or chemical feedstock.1,2 Si is a promising material for the photocathode in a PEC cell, since its conduction band edge position is more negative than the hydrogen evolution reaction potential for reduction of water to H2.3 However, the sluggish surface reaction is a major drawback for silicon. The noble metal platinum (Pt) is known as the most efficient and stable co-catalyst for hydrogen evolution. Unfortunately, Pt is an extremely scarce resource, making it expensive to use on a large scale for hydrogen production technologies. Thus, development of an efficient, low-cost and eco-friendly material as an alternative to noble metals is extremely important.4,5
Carbon nanodots (CNDs) are generally defined as small carbon nanoparticles with excellent properties such as chemical stability, nontoxicity and easier large-scale production with low cost. CNDs have been coupled with semiconductor nanoparticles such as TiO2, Ag3PO4, Fe2O3 and C3N4 to improve their photocatalytic abilities.6–10 In addition, it was revealed that N is an excellent element for the stable chemical doping of carbon nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes and graphene to improve their photoelectron related properties, especially in the photocatalysis field.11,12 Recently, Sim et al. reported that monolayer graphene deposited onto planar and microwire Si electrodes acts as an efficient hydrogen evolved reaction (HER) electrocatalyst and that N2-plasma treatment enhances their catalytic activity.13,14 The on-set potentials and the saturated photocurrents were (0.13 V vs. RHE, 32 mA cm−2) and (0.26 V vs. RHE, 35 mA cm−2) for the N-doped graphene-decorated planar and microwire Si photocathodes, respectively. However, they are still lower than the values obtained for Pt decorated Si photocathodes,15,16 indicating that carbon nanostructures may not be sufficient to replace Pt entirely. Recently, CNDs have been used to enhance the PEC hydrogen generation of TiO2 nanotube arrays, SrTiO3 films and BiVO4 inverse opals.17–19 We are unaware of any published results for CNDs and/or N-doped CNDs (N-CNDs) as electro-catalysts on silicon photocathodes for HER. Compared with monolayer graphene, CNDs are easier to produce in large-scale and with low-cost. In this work we present the PEC results for np+-Si photocathodes catalyzed by CNDs. Similar to monolayer graphene, the catalytic activity of CNDs can be boosted obviously by plasma treatment in an N2-ambient atmosphere. In addition, we show that N-CNDs can be used as supports for Pt allowing for the reduction in Pt loading for HER.
The photocathode is constructed on single-crystal n-type silicon. An aluminum (Al)-doped p-type rear emitter is formed using a simple screen-printing process. On the front surface, the Si surface is protected by a 2 nm thin Al2O3 layer.20 We defined this as an np+-Si photocathode. The CNDs are synthesized using electrochemical ablation of graphite,7 which are dispersed in water with a concentration of about 20 μg mL−1. To produce CNDs/np+-Si photocathodes, 0.1 mL CND-contained water is dropped on the 1.3 cm × 1.3 cm Si electrode surface and then dried in air at room temperature. Such deposition attaches about 1.2 μg cm−2 CNDs on the Si surface. The PEC properties of the CNDs/np+-Si photocathodes can be optimized by changing the deposition times. The N2-plasma treatment is performed using a capacitive coupled radio-frequency (27.12 MHz) discharge with a power of 100 W, working pressure of 15 Pa and a time period of about 2 minutes.

Fig. 1a shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the CNDs. They are spherical and fairly mono-dispersed, with diameters distributed in the range of 2 to 8 nm. High-resolution TEM in the inset of Fig. 1a shows that the lattice spacing of CNDs is 0.321 nm, in good agreement with the crystallographic 〈002〉 spacing of carbon.21 The Raman spectrum of the CNDs shows both a G band at 1590 cm−1 due to in-plane vibration of sp2 single-crystal graphite and a D band at 1320 cm−1 due to the presence of sp3 disordered graphite (Fig. 1b). The obvious band in the D frequency region reflects a large disorder of bond angles, which can be good active sites for hydrogen production.13 The relative intensity of the “disorder” D-band and the crystalline G-band (ID/IG) for as-produced CNDs is around 0.52. After the N2 treatment, the D-band becomes more evident, and ID/IG increases to 0.63, indicating the formation of abundant edges and defective sites in CNDs.

Fig. 1c and d illustrates X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results for C1s and N1s signals. In Fig. 1c, the peak at 284.4 eV can be identified as originating from the C–C sp2 structure. The higher energy peaks at 286.0 eV and 287.9 eV correspond to the sp2 bonded C1s–N structure and the sp3 bonded C1s–N structure, respectively. The corresponding N1s–C binding energies are at 398.7 eV and 400.9 eV (shown in Fig. 1d), which confirm the presence of these two different bonding states between carbon and nitrogen.22 After the N2 treatment, both the sp3 C1s–N and N1s–C XPS become more evident than the sp2 peaks, manifesting that larger part of the N doping present in CNDs replaces the carbon on the disordered sp3 bond. As pointed out by Sim et al.,13 abundant disordered bonds in the graphitic carbon could be catalytic sites for the HER, therefore, an enhanced catalytic effect of CNDs after N2 treatment is expected in this study.
The PEC characterization is carried out using a potentiostat (CH Instruments, CHI660E) in a three-electrode configuration. The measurements are conducted in an aqueous 1 M perchloric acid solution (pH = 0), using the photocathode as the working electrode, an Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. Fig. 2 shows a photocurrent density (J) vs. potential (V) scan for np+-Si photocathodes with different amounts of CNDs deposited on the surface under white light illumination. For the bare Si electrode without the decoration of CNDs, its photocurrent density increases gradually from about 0 V vs. RHE and is saturated at approximately 34 mA cm−2 below −0.67 V vs. RHE. As expected, the overall J–V curves for the CND decorated electrodes are right-shifted obviously. If it is defined as the potential at a photocurrent density of 1 mA cm−2, the onset potential of the pristine Si photocathode is −0.08 V vs. RHE, and this potential is positively shifted to 0.11 V vs. RHE after the loading of CNDs three-times, which corresponds to 3.6 μg cm−2 CNDs presented on the electrode surface. This result indicates that CNDs can act as effective catalysts for HER on the Si photocathode. However, one more time loading of the CNDs makes the saturated photocurrent decrease to 31 mA cm−2. Note that CNDs can absorb lots of visible light and the optical transmission at 600 nm of CNDs drops from about 90% to 55% with increasing CND loadings (Fig. S1, ESI†), but the saturated photocurrent densities of the corresponding CNDs/np+-Si photocathodes in Fig. 2 barely change. It was reported that CNDs themselves can drive photocatalytic HER, and can form a Z-scheme with other semiconductors like WO3 to improve the HER.23,24 The present study indicates again that CNDs can contribute to the photocatalytic HER. However, a further increased amount of the CNDs at the top of the Si electrode causes less light absorption by Si, which diminishes the synergistic light-to-photocurrent ability of the photocathode. Therefore, the optimal amount of CNDs on the electrode surface is 3.6 μg cm−2. Such a sample exhibits good stability during PEC measurements (Fig. S2, ESI†). This sample is then treated with the N2-plasma. Fig. 2 also shows the J–V curve for the N-CND decorated np+-Si photocathode. Compared with the one for CND/np+-Si, the onset potential further right-shifts to 0.21 V vs. RHE. As a result, the photocurrent at 0 V vs. RHE increases from 3.4 to 10.9 mA cm−2, indicating much higher catalytic activity for HER of the N-CNDs than the untreated CNDs.

J–V curves for np+-Si photocathodes with and without CNDs deposited on the surface, using a scan rate of 25 mV s−1 and a white light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 Xe-lamp illumination. 
To further prove the catalytic activity for HER of both the CNDs and N-CNDs, they are coated on p+n-Si electrodes, respectively, and the J–V scans in the dark are performed to check their electrochemical performance. Note that the p+n-Si junction has a forward bias and low electrical resistance with negative potential vs. RHE in the current case. Fig. 3a shows that the current density for CND coated p+n-Si increases at a faster rate than that for pure p+n-Si at potentials more negative than −0.4 V vs. RHE. After the surface is treated with the N2 plasma, a much faster rate is observed. At −1.0 V vs. RHE, the current density enhances from 6 mA cm−2 for pure p+n-Si, to 16 mA cm−2 for CND/p+n-Si, and to 23 mA cm−2 for N-CND/p+n-Si, manifesting the excellent electrocatalytic activity toward HER of the CNDs and N-CNDs.

(d) The schematic band diagram of the CND/np+-Si or N-CND/np+-Si photocathodes. 
We also performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement to elucidate the charge-transfer resistances in different photocathodes. Two distinguishable semicircles in Fig. 3b can be observed in the Nyquist impedance plots. The left semicircle remains nearly unchanged, while the second semicircle changes obviously, when the CNDs and N-CNDs are coated on the electrode surface. As discussed in our previous work, the second semicircle is governed by the charge separation and transfer at the front surface of the electrode, whereas the left one is dominated by the rear np+ junction.20 The right semicircle for the CND and N-CND coated Si electrodes are dramatically smaller than that without CNDs, indicating much better improvement for the charge separation and transfer in the front Si surface region.

Fig. 3c shows the Mott–Schottky plots for the photocathodes. Capacitance measurements were performed as the potential swept from −0.1 V to 0.4 V vs. RHE in a three-electrode cell without illumination. The flat band potential (Efb) can be determined by extrapolation to a capacitance of zero.14 The N-CND/np+-Si electrode exhibits an Efb of 0.35 V vs. RHE, whereas the Efbs of the CND/np+-Si and bare Si electrode are 0.26 V and 0.11 V vs. RHE, respectively. Higher band bending at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte promotes faster charge separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.25 We also measured the open-circuit photovoltages (Vphs) of the three samples (Fig. S3, ESI†). Upon illumination, Vphs of the N-CND/Si, CND/Si and the bare Si are 0.36, 0.26 and 0.10 V, respectively, consistent with the Mott–Schottky measurements.
The device structure of this work is rather non-conventional: the p+n junction locates at the rear surface and the front surface exposes the n-Si/electrolyte interface which does not work for HER. If there is no CND and Al2O3 layer on the electrode surface, an opposite weak barrier on the n-Si/electrolyte interface to that on the np+ junction may form. As studied in our previous work, the height of this barrier can be lowered significantly after coating of the Al2O3 layer, resulting in the enhancement of the majority tunneling current.20 In addition, CNDs have a work function of about 4.2 eV,26 which is smaller than ∼4.4 eV of Si. Therefore, we assume that a buried junction at CND/Al2O3/n-Si forms instead of an n-Si/electrolyte interface at the front surface, which is favorable for the PEC reaction. Consequently, a band diagram of the electrolyte/CND/np+-Si is schematically presented in Fig. 3d. Efb for the CND or N-CND/np+-Si photocathodes can be enhanced due to the elimination of the opposite barrier.
As mentioned in the introduction, Pt is more active than the carbon nanostructure for HER. Our previous study also showed that the Pt loaded np+-Si photocathode has an on-set potential of 0.52 V vs. RHE.20 To check whether the N-CNDs are effective supports for Pt nanoparticles allowing for the reduction in Pt loading, we measured and compared the J–V curves for the N-CND/np+-Si and bare np+-Si photocathodes deposited with different amounts of the Pt catalyst through controlling the time during the electrochemical deposition. Note that we can get the exact Pt amount on the electrode surface based on the current and time during electrochemical deposition (Fig. S4, ESI†). Fig. 4 shows that the on-set potential for N-CNDs/np+-Si electrodes reaches the maximum as the Pt amount is 7.8 μg cm−2, while that for bare np+-Si is 26.9 μg cm−2. In Fig. 4, we draw the dependence of photocurrent density on the Pt amount taken from Fig. S4 (ESI†). The trends are the same as those of the on-set potential, etc., the maximum photocurrent density of 7.8 μg cm−2 for N-CND/np+-Si and 26.9 μg cm−2 for bare np+-Si. The inset of Fig. 4 also shows that the saturated photocurrent density for N-CND/np+-Si is higher than that for bare np+-Si (34.7 vs. 31.8 mA cm−2), since more Pt on the surface of the bare np+ electrode will block more light to get into silicon. To qualitatively compare the amount of Pt deposited on the Pt(7.8 μg cm−2)/N-CND/np+-Si and Pt(26.9 μg cm−2)/np+-Si photocathodes we imaged them by SEM (Fig. S6, ESI†). Clearly there is more Pt on the latter photocathodes. Collectively, the PEC results and SEM images demonstrate that depositing a small amount (3.6 μg cm−2) of N-CNDs onto np+-Si is an effective means of reducing the required Pt loading by a factor of about 3.5 while improving the PEC activity for the HER.

In summary, CNDs are demonstrated to be effective catalysts for solar-driven HER on np+-Si photocathodes and their catalytic activity can be boosted obviously by N2-plasma treatment. The onset potential can be improved from −0.08 V vs. RHE for the bare np+-Si photocathode, to 0.11 V vs. RHE for CND/np+-Si, and further to 0.21 V vs. RHE for N-CND/np+-Si. XPS and Raman results revealed that the plasma treatment induced obvious sp3 disordered C–C and C–N structures in the CNDs, which can act as catalytic sites, leading to better carrier transfer, electrochemical activity and higher Efb at the electrode/electrolyte interface. In addition, N-CNDs can be used as supports for Pt allowing for the reduction in Pt loading by a factor of above 3.5 while improving the activity for HER.
