    , Accepted 4th September 2018First published on 27th September 2018AbstractSilicon nanopillar (NP) arrays are known to exhibit efficient light trapping and broadband absorption of solar radiation. In this study, we consider the effect of deep subwavelength sidewall scalloping (DSSS) on the broadband absorption of the arrays. Practically, the formation of DSSS is a side effect of top-down dry etching of NP arrays of several microns height. We use finite-difference time-domain electromagnetic calculations to show that the presence of DSSS can result in efficient excitation of optical modes in both the arrays and the underlying substrates. We demonstrate a broadband absorption enhancement of >10% in a DSSS-NP array with an underlying substrate. Finally, we use device calculations to examine the effect of DSSS on the electrical performance of a photovoltaic cell, as the main concern is the degradation of the open-circuit voltage due to surface recombination (DSSS results in higher surface-to-volume ratio). We show that the effect of DSSS on open-circuit voltage is negligible. Finally, deep-subwavelength sidewall features offer a new, interesting photon management strategy towards absorption enhancement.
Introduction
Light trapping concerns the capture of photons from an impinging electromagnetic wave and it is a fundamental phenomenon with important technological applications, particularly in the field of solar energy conversion.1–4 Light trapping is particularly interesting for photovoltaic (PV) applications as it introduces an additional strategy towards ultra-thin photovoltaic cells. Ultra-thin solar cells with absorption comparable to bulk solar cells directly lead to lower recombination currents, higher open circuit voltages and therefore higher photovoltaic efficiencies,5 as well as allow the commercialization of photovoltaic cells based on scarce materials. The density of photonic states (DOS) in a planar thin film is composed of both radiation modes (e.g. Fabry–Perot (FP) modes) and trapped traveling modes (e.g. guided modes). However, the wavenumbers of the guided modes are not accessible to the radiation impinging on the top surface unless some extent of scattering takes place. The Yablonovitch limit maximizes the probability of modal occupation within a thin film by texturing the top and bottom interfaces, which imparts additional wavenumbers to the impinging illumination.6,7
Surface texturing with ordered or disordered arrays of subwavelength (or the scale of a wavelength) features was demonstrated to increase light trapping in thin films (TF) beyond the Yablonovitch limit.8–12 Arrays of subwavelength features potentially impart wavenumber additions to the impinging photons by diffraction and scattering, and in this way allow the occupation of the various guided modes.13–15 Furthermore, arrays of semiconducting subwavelength surface structures introduce additional localized trapped modes (Mie modes) and various modal hybridizations. The introduction of these leads to a high local density of states that provides efficient coupling between the impinging illumination and the absorbing material.9,16
Nanopillar (NP) arrays have been thoroughly studied in recent years due to their exceptional properties and importance in various applications.17–19 Efficient light trapping and broadband absorption enhancement of solar radiation was demonstrated with vertically aligned nanopillar arrays, nanocone arrays, nanosphere arrays, light funnel arrays, etc.9,10,12,16,20–25,26–35 Fountaine et al. numerically demonstrated near unity broadband absorption by GaAs NP arrays,29 and experimentally showed near unity absorption in InP NP arrays.4 Wallentin et al. demonstrated 13.8% photovoltaic efficiency with InP NP arrays by exceeding the ray optic limit.10 Spinelli et al. demonstrated black silicon with arrays of silicon nanocylinders for which the absorption is attributed to forward scattering by the cylinders.36
NP arrays are fabricated by either top-down or bottom-up fabrication techniques. The most celebrated bottom-up technique is the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) growth method with which NP arrays with heights of tens of microns were realized.37–39 Top-down fabrication of NP arrays based on nanosphere lithography and dry or wet etching techniques has attracted attention due to its inherently low costs.23,40 Specifically, the fabrication of NP arrays using nanosphere lithography and cryogenic inductively coupled plasma reactive-ion etching (ICP-RIE) facilitates the formation of homogeneous arrays with smooth NP surfaces and whose dimensions are optimized to harvest the solar spectrum. However, the formation of such optimized, radially uniform and untapered NP arrays is currently only possible with relatively small aspect ratios, a scenario that limits the NP height to only a few microns.23,40–44 The Bosch etching process provides NP arrays of a greater aspect ratio. A side effect of the Bosch etching is the generation of deep subwavelength features on the NP sidewall. Deep subwavelength sidewall scalloping (DSSS) is the result of the cyclic nature of the Bosch etching process (Fig. 1). Traditionally, for photovoltaic applications, the formation of DSSS implies an increase in surface recombination that entails a decrease in open-circuit voltage.

In the current work we numerically examine the effect of selected DSSS geometries on light trapping and the broadband absorption of the solar radiation in NP arrays. Finally, we also examine the electrical effect of NP DSSS specifically in relation to surface recombination as DSSS increases the surface-to-volume ratio.
Methodology
Fabrication of NP DSSS arrays
Fabrication of silicon NP-DSSS arrays is performed using a SiO2 hard mask for the silicon dry etching process. For this purpose, a 500 nm thick plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) SiO2 layer is firstly deposited on the silicon surface using a CVD system (MPX from SPTS). Electron beam lithography (EPBG 5200 from Vistec Raith) is subsequently used to define the array geometry. The layout consists of a dense square-packed array of circular pillars with a diameter of 400 nm and a period of 500 nm. AR-N 7520 negative e-beam resist is spun on the SiO2 surface to a thickness of 200 nm and exposed via a 100 keV electron beam. After exposure, the resist is developed using a 4:3 mixture of AR 300-47 developer and water. The small separation between the pillars, equal to one-quarter of the pillar diameter, promotes the over-development and subsequent widening of the resist disks due to proximity effects while writing with the electron beam. The mask geometry has been appropriately adjusted to compensate for this effect, as well as those derived from later SiO2 and Si etching processes. Due to these, circles of 325 nm diameter have been exposed to reach the 400 nm diameter goal.
Etching of the SiO2 layer is performed using a reactive ion etching (RIE) tool (APS from SPTS) with a fluorinated (C4F8) etching chemistry. The uniformity of the etching process is better than 5% at the wafer scale, so that the over-etching time can be limited to 5% in order to preserve the critical dimensions obtained on the resist mask, after the accurate measurement of both the SiO2 layer thickness and the recipe etching rate once the tool is properly conditioned. The resist is later striped using an oxygen plasma treatment on a PVA GIGAbatch 360 M tool from Tepla.
NP-DSSS arrays are finally obtained with a silicon dry etching process performed with a deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) process on a Pegasus tool from SPTS using slight variations of the Bosch process (SF6/C4F8) etching chemistry to customize the scalloping of the pillar walls. The etching details of the samples presented in Fig. 1 can be found in the ESI.†
After the silicon dry etching process, the remaining SiO2 hard mask is removed using HF vapours on a SiO2 etching tool (Primaxx from SPTS), and the samples are finally cleaned on a chemical bath using PlasmaSolv® EKC265™ post-etching residue remover, isopropanol and water to remove the residues generated during the DRIE process.
Finite-difference time-domain three-dimensional electromagnetic simulations
We performed three-dimensional (3D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) electromagnetic simulations using Advanced TCAD from Synopsys (Mountain View, CA, USA). The simulation box size is set to the size of the unit cell with periodic boundary conditions along the lateral dimensions (x–y plane) and complementary perfectly matched layers (CPML) along the z-direction. The periodic boundary conditions are applied to normally incident plane wave (the electric field along the x-axis) excitation using the total-field scattered-field (TFSF) formulation. The number of photons absorbed, reflected and transmitted are extracted at each wavelength using sensors that are located above and below the unit cell. Respectively, the absorptivity, the reflectivity and the transmissivity are calculated. In addition, the power flux density (PFD), which is the time-averaged Poynting vector (Sav), and the absorbed photon density (APD) at each mesh point are calculated for each wavelength. The absorbed photon density is calculated by dividing the absorbed power density (W = −div Sav = 1/2σ|E2| in which σ is the nonzero conductivity of silicon and E is the impinging electric field) by the energy of the incident photon. The calculations are performed in the spectrum range of 400–900 nm in 20 nm steps. The maximum mesh cell size is kept smaller than 1/10th of the wavelength in silicon (more than 10 nodes per wavelength) in order to ensure efficient and accurate FDTD simulations. The weighted absorptivity (ηabs) is the absorptivity averaged and weighted with the solar spectrum. The weighted absorptivity was calculated in the following manner:  where A(λ) and I(λ) are the absorptivity and Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM1.5G) solar radiation as a function of the wavelength, respectively. The optical constants of silicon materials are taken from the literature.45
Electrical simulations
The device 3D simulations (Sentaurus Device, Synopsys Inc.) examine the electrical performance of a single NP nested in a NP array. The Poisson and the Continuity equations are solved for each mesh vertex together with the carrier generation profile, which is calculated from ηabs. The top and bottom contacts define the respective boundary conditions (biasing conditions). The simulated NP PV cell comprises a degenerately phosphorus-doped emitter (n-type) and a boron-doped base (p-type). The carrier generation profile is calculated as follows: for excitation energy greater than or equal to the bandgap energy, the quantum efficiency is set to one; otherwise, it is set to zero. In every simulation mesh point, the Poisson and the Continuity equations are solved where Auger recombination, doping dependent Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination, bandgap renormalization for degenerately doped silicon and doping dependent mobility are all accounted for. We assume that standard Czochralski (cz) silicon is the starting material, which is reflected in the selection of the following parameters. The rate of Auger recombination is calculated in the following manner:46 RAnet = (Cnn + Cpp)(np − n2i,eff),(1)where Cn and Cp were set to 2.9 × 10−31 cm6 s−1 and 1 × 10−31 cm6 s−1, respectively.47 The rate of SRH is calculated in the following manner:46 (2)where n and p are the respective electron and hole carrier densities, ni,eff is the effective intrinsic density (accounting for bandgap narrowing), τn and τp are the respective electron and hole lifetimes, and n1 and p1 are (3) (4)where Etrap, the difference between the defect level and the intrinsic level, is set to zero. The dependency of SRH recombination on doping is reflected in the dependency of carrier lifetime on doping: (5)where NA and ND are the chemically active acceptor and donor concentrations, respectively. We select γ = 1, τmin = 0, Nref = 1016 cm−3 for both holes, and τmax = 10−5 seconds and 3 × 10−6 seconds for electrons and holes, respectively.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a–c presents high resolution scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of a silicon NP array with smooth sidewalls, a NP array with DSSS and a NP array with a greater DSSS, respectively. Fig. 1d presents an illustration of a NP with a DSSS; in the current manuscript, the geometry of the DSSS is defined by the height (H) and the width (W) of the DSSS, as shown in the figure. Fig. 1d presents an illustration of a NP with a DSSS; in the current manuscript, the geometry of the DSSS is defined by the height (H) and the width (W) of the DSSS, as shown in the figure. Fig. 1e–g shows high resolution SEM images of a NP with smooth sidewalls, NP with a DSSS geometry of H = 73 nm and W = 24 nm and a NP with a DSSS of H = 155 nm and W = 50 nm. In the following, we perform the analysis of NP arrays that are optimized for the absorption of solar radiation, namely, an array period of 500 nm and a NP diameter of 400 nm.34 Generally, DSSS induced by the Bosch etching is characterized by H/W ratios between ∼3 and ∼2, but the DSSS dimensions can vary considerably depending on the etching switching times. In the current work, we consider typical DSSS dimensions that range between a few dozens to a few hundreds of nanometers. Accordingly, the DSSS considered in the current study are with H/W ratios of 30/10, 60/20, 90/30, 120/40, 200/67 and 200/100.

Fig. 2a presents the absorptivity of 1 μm high NP arrays without DSSS and with a DSSS of 90/30 and 200/100 on top of a 1 μm substrate (henceforth termed total absorptivity). A gold bottom reflector is considered in order to further enhance the optical coupling between the array and the substrate, and in this way to better understand the effect of DSSS on the optical excitation of the array itself as well as the excitation of the underlying substrate. To this end, the contributions of the substrates and the arrays to the overall absorption are considered separately, and hence the array absorptivities and the substrate absorptivities are plotted in Fig. 2b and c, respectively. Noticeably, the three geometries present strong absorption peaks at wavelengths higher than ∼600 nm. Furthermore, a comparison of Fig. 2a with b–c shows that the origin of the strong absorption peaks (for wavelengths higher than ∼600 nm) is due to the strong spectral absorption in the substrates (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2d presents the ηabs of a NP array without DSSS, and NP arrays with a DSSS of 90/30 and 200/100. Note that the presence of an NP array with a DSSS of 90/30 leads to an ηabs increase of ∼5% compared with the no-DSSS array (whereas the 200/100 array results in an absorptivity decrease); while the absorptivity in the arrays is similar, the absorptivity in the 90/30 substrate is 13.5% higher (33.5% and 29.5% for the 90/30 substrate and the no-DSSS substrate, respectively) than the substrate absorptivity of the NP array without DSSS. It is remarkable that, as for various applications in which strong optical excitation of the substrate is needed, adequate photon management using DSSS can result in a substantial increase in substrate absorption. Also, importantly, the presented data are not optimized but rather the geometries were selected arbitrarily to coincide with realistic values of sidewall scalloping, and therefore it is more than plausible that greater enhancements in substrate absorption can be obtained. The origin of the 90/30 substrate absorptivity enhancement is efficient optical excitations due to the presence of DSSS. For example, the presence of DSSS can impart additional momentum components to the incoming radiation to allow for enhanced excitations of guided modes or near-field optical concentration enhancement that would result in an additional excitation of the substrate. Interestingly, DSSS does not alter the photon DOS of the substrate, of course, but rather increase the state occupation probability (occupation number). Fig. 2e presents the normalized PFD under the illumination of the solar irradiance. Note the enhanced optical excitation of the substrate driven by the near-field light concentration and the forward scattering into the substrate due to the presence of DSSS. Fig. 2f shows the respective normalized APD in which the absorption enhancement in the substrate is evident. Finally, Fig. 2 g presents PFD at a wavelength of 700 nm (marked with a dashed line in Fig. 2a) in which the scalloping-driven light trapping enhancement in both the array and the substrate is evident. Also, note the enhanced coupling of the near-field light to the NPs for the DSSS 90/30 geometry. Examination of Fig. 2b and c reveals that the increased light trapping at a wavelength of 700 nm is mainly due to higher excitation of the substrate due to the presence of DSSS.

Next, we examine the effect of DSSS on array–substrate systems with higher NP arrays. Fig. 3a–c present the total ηabs, the array ηabs and the substrate ηabs for various DSSS geometries and for array heights of 5 μm on top of 1 μm and 4 μm substrates, respectively (a gold bottom reflector is considered). The dashed horizontal black and red lines indicate the respective ηabs without DSSS for substrate heights of 1 μm and 4 μm, respectively (the total ηabs of both is somewhat similar on account of the gold back reflector). First, note that although the total ηabs for the 1 μm and 4 μm substrates is similar (∼85%), still the origin of the total ηabs is different; the array ηabs provides the main contribution to the 1 μm substrate, whereas the substrate ηabs provides the main contribution to the 4 μm substrate, as expected. The total ηabs, for both the 1 μm and 4 μm substrates, slightly increases for a DSSS of 90/30, and decreases substantially for a greater DSSS (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3b indicates that no array ηabs enhancement is recorded for the various DSSS. However, Fig. 3c presents a significant substrate ηabs enhancement due to DSSS; for example, the substrate ηabs of the 1 μm substrate increases by 20% and 30% for DSSS of 90/30 and 200/100, respectively, and the substrate ηabs of the 4 μm substrate increases by 23% for 200/100 DSSS. Fig. 3d presents the normalized PFD distribution under illumination with solar irradiance for no-DSSS and DSSS of 200/100. The higher substrate PFD for the DSSS array is apparent. Fig. 3e presents the respective normalized AP distribution in which the higher substrate APD for the DSSS array is apparent.

Next, we examine the case of a short NP array on top of a thicker substrate; the array height is set to 0.5 μm and the substrate thickness is 4 μm. Fig. 4a–c presents the total absorptivity, the array absorptivity and the substrate absorptivity for NP arrays without DSSS and NP arrays with a DSSS of 90/30 and a DSSS of 200/100 (a gold bottom reflector is considered). It is evident that, as expected, for lower wavelengths (400–600 nm), the total absorptivity is mainly affected by the NP array (Fig. 4b), whereas the substrate absorptivity is the dominant contributor for higher wavelengths. Fig. 4d presents the respective values of ηabs. Note that the total ηabs of the NP arrays with DSSS is 11% and 5% higher than those of NP arrays without DSSS and with DSSS of 90/30 and 200/100, respectively. Interestingly, unlike the case studies explored above, the main contribution to the ηabs enhancements is higher array absorption (an enhancement of 15.3% and 11% for DSSS 90/30 and 200/100, respectively). In other words, the presence of DSSS resulted in efficient excitation of the various LF array optical modes (e.g. hybridization of Mie modes and Fabry–Perot modes). Fig. 4e presents the normalized PFD (under the illumination of solar irradiance) of the NP array without DSSS and of the NP array with the 90/30 DSSS, from which the stronger excitation of the NP array with the 90/30 DSSS is evident.

Photon density per energy interval depends on the product of the modal occupation number and the DOS: dnγ(ħω) = Dγ (ħω) υ(ħω) d(ħω), where nγ is the photon density per interval energy, Dγ (ħω) is the DOS per interval energy and υ(ħω) is the modal occupation number.9 Therefore, the high trapped photon density in NP arrays due to DSSS could be attributed to higher DOS or higher υ(ħω). In order to better understand the origin of the DSSS-driven excitations in the arrays, we perform the following analysis: we consider a NP array composed of 300 nm in diameter NPs, superimposed with two DSSS geometries: 90/30 and 200/100 (Fig. 5a). The relatively small 90/30 DSSS does not add a significant amount of volume to the NP and therefore absorption enhancement suggests that the DSSS contributes mainly to an increase in modal occupation number. On the other hand, the larger 200/100 DSSS does add volume to the 300 nm NP array and therefore the absorption enhancement could also be attributed to the introduction of additional photonic states. The ηabs of the NP array with 90/30 DSSS is slightly higher than that of the NP array without DSSS due to a higher ηabs array, but more importantly it is significantly higher than the ηabs of the NP array with the 200/100 DSSS. This suggests that the DSSS-driven ηabs enhancement is due to an efficient occupation of the photonic states allowed by the presence of the DSSS (i.e. an increase in modal occupation number).

Finally, we examine the effect of DSSS on the electrical performance of a photovoltaic cell. We perform an electrical comparison between the NP array with 90/30 DSSS and a NP array without DSSS; specifically, the calculations pertain to the opto-electronic performance of single NPs (with and without DSSS) nested in their respective arrays. The selected geometries are taken from Fig. 4. The main electrical concern is the increase in surface recombination due to a higher surface-to-volume (S/V) ratio introduced by the DSSS. Therefore, we selected an axial junction configuration as it is more susceptible to surface effects than a radial structure.23,48,49Fig. 6a shows the current vs. voltage (I–V) curves for a base doping level of 1016 cm−3, and the inset presents the normalized electrostatic potential distribution for both structures. The white and brown lines mark the depletion region and the metallurgical junction, respectively. The extracted nominal power conversion efficiencies (a fill factor of 1 is assumed as the various resistances in the cells are identical) are 16% and 14.7% for the DSSS and the no-DSSS PV cells, accordingly, which reflects an overall increase of 9% in efficiency.

Voc and Isc as a function of absorber doping for no-DSSS and 90/30. c. The dependency of Voc and Isc on SRV for a base doping level of 1016 cm−3. 

Fig. 6b presents the open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current (Isc) of NPs with and without 90/30 DSSS for a range of base doping levels and the respective SRH bulk lifetimes as doping-dependent SRH recombination implies that the bulk SRH minority carrier lifetimes τSRH are coupled to the doping level.50–53 For both devices Isc decreases with an increase in base doping due to the increase in SRH recombination. Also in both cases Voc exhibits a maximum where it increases for a base doping of 1016 cm−3–1018 cm−3 despite the decrease in Isc; the increase in base doping entails a decrease in saturation current and an increase in Voc while the simultaneous decrease in τSRH leads to an increase in saturation current and a decrease in Voc.46 Note that for a base doping level of 1019 cm−3 the effect of the recombination overcomes the gain due to the increase in doping, and an overall decrease in both Isc and Voc is observed. The highest Isc enhancement of almost 10% is recorded for a base doping of 1016 cm−3 (for all doping levels, the DSSS Voc is about 1% higher due to the higher Isc), which leads to a nominal efficiency enhancement (i.e. Isc × Voc) of 10%. Fig. 6c presents the dependencies of Voc and Isc for both devices on SRV (base doping of 1016 cm−3), from which it is apparent that the effect of DSSS on Voc is negligible for the selected DSSS geometry. Finally, surface recombination can be substantially reduced in radial junction configurations or with the application of appropriate surface passivation as, for example, was already demonstrated with Al2O3 passivation where SRV < 10 cm s−1 was measured.54
Conclusions
Sidewall scalloping in NP arrays, which is an outcome of the Bosch dry etching sequence, is usually considered an unwanted consequence of the fabrication process. This work reveals that NP-DSSS geometry promotes, in some situations, significant enhancements of broadband absorption achieved with NP arrays. Henceforth, a new path for the further improvement of broadband absorption in silicon NP arrays can be established through adequate management of the etching recipe sequence to optimize the DSSS geometry.
