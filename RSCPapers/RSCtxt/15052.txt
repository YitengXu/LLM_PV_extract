    , Accepted 23rd March 2023First published on 25th April 2023AbstractThe need for energy storage and conversion is growing as a result of the worsening consequences of climate change and the depletion of fossil fuels. Energy conversion and storage requirements are rising as a result of environmental problems including global warming and the depletion of fossil fuels. The key to resolving the energy crisis is anticipated to be the quick growth of sustainable energy sources including solar energy, wind energy, and hydrogen energy. In this review, we have focused on discussing various quantum dots (QDs) and polymers or nanocomposites used for SCs and have provided examples of each type's performance. Effective QD use has really led to increased performance efficiency in SCs. The use of quantum dots in energy storage devices, batteries, and various quantum dots synthesis have all been emphasized in a number of great literature articles. In this review, we have homed in on the electrode materials based on quantum dots and their composites for storage and quantum dot based flexible devices that have been published up to this point.
1. Introduction
Quantum dots (QDs) exhibit size dependent characteristics, strong photostability, and good charge carrier mobility, as well as band gap tunability with appropriate surface treatment, making them appealing alternatives for low-cost, solution processed optoelectronic devices. QDs have been explored as luminous materials for over ten years. In contrast to photolysis, the luminescence mechanism of QDs includes radiative combination of photo-generated carriers. Semiconductor QDs have been adsorbed on photocatalysts in recent years to increase visible-light photoactivity.2 QDs, a name for semiconductor nanoparticles, are distinguished by having diameters that are typically smaller than 100 nm (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Properties and applications of quantum dots.1 
They have unique characteristics that differ from those of the bulk counterpart materials as a result of their small size. They also have a large band gap, which for ZnS at ambient temperature has a specific value of 3.66 eV.3 It is feasible to stimulate QDs in a large wavelength range, below the wavelengths of fluorescence because they have very intriguing fluorescence features.4 The emission wavelength strongly varies depending on the particle size as well as the structure of the corresponding phase. They perform more fluorescence-wise than traditional organic dyes. In addition, the particle size, which is directly related to their technique of synthesis, the type, and amount of the doping element, has a significant impact on the quantum yield fluorescence and emission spectrum.5 QDs were thought to be among the finest possibilities for a wide range of uses based on these specific properties, particularly those focused on electroluminescent research, photovoltaic panels, infrared windows, and dielectric filters. As applications have been extended to various fields in biology, chemistry and physics, many new exigencies in the native nanoparticles are required.6 Producing quantum dots on a large scale is vital for achieving the objective of incorporating quantum dot technology in different sectors like biomedicine, energy, and electronics. In a recent study conducted by Junfei Ma et al., they were able to successfully create multi-color CDs using heavy oil and its three SDA products: light deasphalted oil (LDAO), heavy deasphalted oil (HDAO), and asphalt. Among these precursors, the CDs obtained from asphalt had the highest yield of up to 64%, which is the highest recorded so far.7 On the other hand, Shouzhen Li et al. present a novel approach to building white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) using machine learning guided V4C3 MXene quantum dots. The study used machine learning algorithms to predict the optimal conditions for synthesizing quantum dots, and the resulting particles exhibited excellent thermal and photostability. This study offers significant contributions to the field of quantum dot technology.8 Quan Xu et al. present an innovative approach to the synthesis of quantum dots using microwave-assisted techniques with narrow size distribution and machine learning algorithms. They also show the potential of these quantum dots for use in biomedical imaging, specifically for detecting residual H2O2 in human teeth.9
The quantum yield of carbon-based quantum dots is an important parameter that determines their efficiency in various applications. To increase the quantum yield of as-prepared carbon-based quantum dots, certain parameters like heteroatom doping and edge effects need to be optimized. In recent studies, heteroatom doping was used to introduce heteroatoms, such as nitrogen or sulfur, into carbon-based quantum dots, which can improve their electronic properties and increase their quantum yield. On the other hand, edge effects, which refer to the surface structure of the quantum dots, have been found to play a significant role in their quantum yield enhancement. Increasing the number of edge sites on the surface of carbon-based quantum dots can lead to higher quantum yields. Overall, optimizing these parameters, namely heteroatom doping and edge effects, can significantly enhance the quantum yield of carbon-based quantum dots, making them more effective in various applications.
Recently, a new category of carbon nanostructures known as carbon-based nanocrystals (C-QDs) has received a lot of attention, particularly in the field of energy applications. C-QDs have recently undergone a thorough examination for photocatalytic applications. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are mono- or very few graphene sheets having lateral dimensions smaller than 100 nm, which are a subclass of C-QDs.10 GQDs are widely used in many fields of science, such as biology, sensors, and energy conversion.11 They have distinctive qualities, such as their outstanding up-conversion and size dependent photoluminescence, durable chemical inertness, high water solubility, and low cytotoxicity. GQDs have also lately been investigated for use in photocatalytic processes. The GQDs and semiconductors have a strong chemical connection that makes their composites more stable with improved charge transfer and higher photocatalytic activity.12 The three categories into which the most commonly used QDs can be broadly divided are: (i) cadmium chalcogenide QDs, which include CdS, CdSe, and CdTe and their own alloyed nanocrystals;13 (ii) top spot chalcogenide QDs, which include PbS, PbSe, and PbTe and their alloyed nanocrystals;14 and (iii) a new type of QD. For solar applications, various co-sensitization systems, such as CdS/CdSe, have also been investigated to improve light harvesting and decrease charge recombination.15 The insufficient light harvesting caused by the narrow spectrum response constrained to the UV visible area is one of the significant problems restricting the enhanced performance for a variety of QDSCs, as is well known. As a result, if infrared light beyond 700 nm can be successfully utilized, which makes up about half of solar energy, photovoltaics should perform significantly better. Due to its near-infrared (NIR) sensitive light harvesting, lead chalcogenide QD-based photovoltaics, particularly PbS QDSCs,16 have been widely explored recently among all of these options. PbS has a high exciton Bohr radius (r = 18 nm) and a limited range gap (Eg = 0.41 eV), which makes it possible to fully utilize solar energy and has high potential to actualize the MEG effect.17
CDs and graphene are both used to create GQDs, which have a diameter under 20 nm.18 This 0-D nanomaterial is a great probe for better contrast image and sensing applications because of its steady luminosity, high solubility in a variety of solvents, strong biocompatibility, potential for edge functionalization, and acceptable conductivity. Additionally, other QDs (CdS, CdSe, ZnS, ZnSe, PbS, HgTe, Ag2Se, Ag2S, CuInSe2, CuInS2, InAs, and InP)19 that are not employed in biological systems because of the presence of toxic metals have been suggested as a less harmful substitute for GQDs.20 Furthermore, GQDs are easily functionalized with oxygen-containing groups like hydroxyl, carboxyl, and epoxy groups to improve their hydrophilicity and biocompatibility.21 The answer to global warming, the energy problem, and environmental pollution is decarbonized clean energy like solar, wind, and geothermal energy.22 New energy will take over as the primary source of electricity in the framework of decarbonization, and the storage of huge volumes of renewable power will be a significant difficulty. These energy sources must be maintained and released at any moment because they are naturally intermittent. The primary solution to this problem will be electrochemical energy storage, such as batteries and super-capacitors.23 Additionally, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution relies on promoting electrochemical hydride creation and photochemical bonding to create fuel, which is another “green” way to store energy.24 As a result of their own large specific area, extendable size, quick electron transfer path, non-toxicity, low price, adjustable photoluminescence, and simple surface functionalization, quantum dots have received a lot of attention recently as possible future electrochemical energy storage devices. The electrode materials employed have a significant influence on the overall efficiency of an electrical energy storage system.25 The surface of QDs is rich in heteroatomic functional groups, offering a variety of active locations. They demonstrate excellent conductivity, high rate, big capacities, and cycle stability,26 which greatly improves the efficiency of electrochemical storage devices.27 They can be employed as composites for conductive substrates and active electrodes for storage devices. Quan Xu et al. reported the review summarizes the applications of quantum dots (QDs) in energy storage and conversion systems such as lithium–sulfur batteries, supercapacitors, and photocatalytic hydrogen production. However, there are imitations of the synthetic QDs strategy and the scarcity of systematic research on QD composites is expected to encounter an explosive growth in the near future.28 Himadri Tanaya Das et al. reported the quantum dots (QDs) and polymer nanocomposites have been utilized in SCs to improve their performance, with carbon-based QDs being the most effective. Ongoing research is focused on utilizing waste materials for SC components, leading to reduced costs and more sustainable energy solutions.29 Hence, the objective of this review is to discuss the impact of advancements in energy conversion and storage technologies on the development of next-generation technology. The review also highlights the importance of batteries and supercapacitors in modern electronics and their potential to be used in future energy-oriented technologies. Additionally, the review provides an overview of the use of quantum dots and nanocomposites in supercapacitors and their contributions to other applications such as medication delivery, biosensors, and electrochemical devices. The objective is to provide insight into the current state of research on these materials and their potential for future applications.
2. Various quantum dots are used in supercapacitors
Quantum dots are nanometer-scale particles made of semiconductor materials that have unique electronic and optical properties due to their small size and quantum confinement effect. The quantum confinement effect is a phenomenon in which the electrons in a material are confined to a small space, leading to quantization of their energy levels. This results in discrete electronic transitions and a unique set of optical and electronic properties that can be tuned by adjusting the size, shape, and composition of the quantum dots.
The structure of quantum dots typically consists of a core material, such as cadmium selenide, surrounded by a shell of a different semiconductor material, such as zinc sulfide. The core–shell structure enhances the stability of the quantum dots and improves their optical properties. The electronic and optical properties of quantum dots make them important for a wide range of applications in fields such as electronics, optoelectronics, and medicine. In electronics, quantum dots are used to create transistors and other electronic devices with improved performance and energy efficiency. They are also used in solar cells to enhance their efficiency by increasing the absorption of light. In optoelectronics, quantum dots are used as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, and sensors. Quantum dot LEDs have several advantages over traditional LEDs, including a broader range of colors and higher brightness. Quantum dot lasers have potential applications in telecommunications and high-speed computing. Quantum dot sensors can be used for the detection of gases, biological molecules, and other substances. Quantum dots are also used in biomedical imaging and drug delivery. In imaging, quantum dots can be used as fluorescent probes to visualize biological structures and processes. They can also be used for in vivo imaging and diagnostics. In drug delivery, quantum dots can be used as carriers for targeted delivery of drugs to specific tissues or cells.
2.1. SnO2 QDs
Tin oxide quantum dots (SnO2 QDs) have gained significant attention as a promising material for energy storage applications due to their unique electronic and structural properties. An ecologically friendly semiconductor with excellent chemical and physical stability is tin oxide (SnO2).30 It has been incorporated into research projects across many different sectors. SnO2 QDs have recently been employed in the creation of solar cells, hybrid electro-chemical capacitors, lithium-ion batteries, and gas sensors. SnO2 QDs were prepared using a variety of techniques. The rationale for choosing SnO2 QDs for energy storage applications can be detailed by considering the following factors: (1) high surface area: which is favorable for increases the number of active sites available for electrochemical reactions in energy storage devices. (2) Abundant and low cost: benefits for large-scale energy storage applications. (3) High theoretical capacity: for lithium-ion storage (782 mA h g−1), which is higher than that of traditional graphite-based anodes. (4) Fast charge and discharge rates: to exhibit excellent rate performance for high-power applications, such as electric vehicles. (5) Stability and durability: reliable material for long-term energy storage applications.
Compatibility with other materials: SnO2 QDs can be easily integrated with other materials, such as carbon and metal oxides, to form hybrid nanocomposites with enhanced performance. The optimal mass ratio of negative electrode activated carbon to positive electrode SnO2 quantum dots was determined to be 1.5:1 using the charge balancing equation, allowing the ASC device cell voltage to be increased to 2 V (Fig. 2). At a fixed scan rate (10 mV s−1), the cyclic voltammograms of the SnO2/AC ASC device were recorded for various potential ranges. As a result, we captured the CV curves (Fig. 2c) at various scan rates while maintaining the SnO2/AC ASC device's potential window (0 to 2.0 V). The CV curves’ shape is not deformed at high scan rates, indicating that the electrode is performing at a fast rate and that electron and ion transports inside the electrode materials are effective.

(d) Specific capacitance as a function of scan rate, (e) GCD plot of SnO2/AC ASC device at various current densities, and (f) specific capacitance as a function of SnO2/AC ASC device current density.31 
Additional specific capacitance for the produced SnO2/AC device as a function of scan rate is shown in Fig. 2d. The estimated specific capacitance at various current densities is shown in Fig. 2f. It should be mentioned that compared to other SnO2 based supercapacitor devices,32 the as-fabricated SnO2/AC ASC device achieved a maximum capacitance of 222 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1.
The device demonstrated the highest energy density of 29.6 W h kg−1, the highest power density of 5310.26 W kg−1, and the highest specific capacitance of 1296 F g−1 in the operating voltage range of 0 to 1.2 V. Additionally, the device had outstanding dependability and maintained 90% capacitance even after 11000 GCD cycles. This ternary composite is a well-known material with promising uses in future portable electronics and energy storage systems (Fig. 3).

2.2. CdS QDs
Cadmium sulfide (CdS) quantum dots, with a huge surface area, a low band gap (2.42 eV), and quantum confinement, are the most important II–IV semiconductors.34 Their outstanding electrochemical, optical, and fluorescence properties enable their efficient application in the pharmaceutical analysis and element detection fields. It is well known that the efficiency of CdS nanoparticles is significantly influenced by their size and spatial structure. As a result, much work has gone into developing CdS nanoparticles with the proper forms and dimensions. Examples of traditional preparation methods include the sol–gel method, hydrothermal synthesis, organic solvent approach, and microwave process. These methods result in CdS QDs with different sizes and morphologies, which affect their electrochemical properties. For example, smaller CdS QDs with a diameter of less than 10 nm have been found to exhibit better capacitance and cyclic stability compared to larger QDs (Fig. 4).

Recent studies have shown that CdS QDs can be effectively utilized as electrode materials in SCs due to their excellent electrochemical properties, such as high capacitance, good cycling stability, and fast charge–discharge rates. For instance, Li et al. reported a facile synthesis of CdS QDs and their subsequent use as electrode materials for SCs, demonstrating an impressive specific capacitance of 265.5 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and good cycling stability over 5000 cycles.36
In this study, layers of self-produced cadmium sulphide QDs and organometallic perovskites materials served as active electrodes for thin-film electrochemical capacitors. Organometallic halide perovskites display remarkable electrical qualities as well as intriguing ionic responses. Electrochemical capacitors were made using these features, and they demonstrated outstanding cycling properties with steady capacitance output beyond 4000 cycles. Perovskites function not only as functional electrodes but also as solid electrolytes,37 increasing the devices’ capacitance and, consequently, the energy densities, according to tests made using impedance spectroscopy. High surface areas in the layers allow electrolytes to access the electrode materials, and it was also noted that the layers’ charge transfer resistance and relaxation time were both quite low. This research creates new possibilities for the advancement of thin-film supercapacitors.
Despite these promising results, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of CdS QDs in SCs. One of the major challenges is the low electrical conductivity of CdS QDs, which can limit their performance as electrode materials. To overcome this challenge, various strategies have been proposed, such as hybridization with carbon-based materials and doping with conductive polymers.38,39
Another challenge is the toxicity of CdS QDs, which can raise environmental and health concerns. To address this issue, researchers have explored the use of non-toxic QDs, such as ZnS and CuS, as alternatives to CdS QDs in SCs.40,41 In summary, CdS QDs have shown great potential as electrode materials in SCs, but further research is needed to address the challenges and fully realize their potential. Future research directions could include exploring new synthesis methods, developing more effective hybridization and doping strategies, and exploring non-toxic alternatives to CdS QDs.
2.3. MoS2 QDs
Quantum dots made of MoS2. Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenide nanomaterials have piqued the interest of researchers in recent years due to their intriguing features,42 which include optical properties, electrical and catalytic activity. As a result, several promising applications have been proven in sensors, photocatalysis, energy, healthcare, and other related domains. In addition, when compared to other morphologies of MoS2 nanostructures, such as nanosheets and nanotubes, MoS2 QDs demonstrated small size and controllable fluorescence emission, endowing them with promising biological applications such as biosensing, bioimaging, and so on.43 Various approaches for the production of MoS2 have been established too far.
UV-Vis absorbance, luminescence, and Raman spectroscopy were used to study the size-dependent characteristics of the MoS2 QDs and NCs. Field emissions scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy were used to analyze the morphological evolution of the NCs and QDs. In contrast to the NCs, which had values of 205 F g−1 and 0.8 V and the pristine MoS2, which had values of 105 F g−1 and 0.6 V at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1, (Fig. 5) the uniform QDs, which had a size of about 2 nm, displayed an extended electrochemical potential window of 0.9 V with a specific capacitance value of 255 F g−1 (Fig. 5). With an energy density of around 5.7 W h kg−1 and a great device capacitance of 50 F g−1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1, the symmetric device made with QDs demonstrated exceptional cycle stability over 10000 cycles with approximately 95% capacitance retention (Fig. 6).

2.4. WS2 QDs
WS2 QDS recent advances in two-dimensional layered inorganic materials, such as monolayer and few-layer sheets of tungsten disulfide (WS2),46 molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), and other dichalcogenides, are being closely studied. Tungsten disulfide (WS2) is an anisotropic material with a trigonal prismatic structure that is a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) compound with a layered structure comparable to graphite. Because of its potential uses in solid lubricants, lithium batteries, bioimaging, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and other fields, the controlled synthesis of WS2 micro–nanomaterials with innovative and superior features has piqued the interest of many researchers.
2.5. GQDs
A GQDs/Gr and AL-based electrodes can be found in Fig. 7. The porous graphene sheet and attached GQDs built a highly scattered GQDs/Gr hetero-junction could enable extremely efficient ionic diffusion and rising frequency of active sites for ion storage, whereas the AL could easily build into activated carbon with a jammed pore structure.

The hybrid supercapacitor can function with such a maximal voltage level of 1.4 V, as shown by both charts. The specific capacitances are 9.8, 8.5, 7.28, 6.45, and 5.85 F cm−3 (Fig. 8(c)). The device's CV curves are displayed in Fig. 8(d).

(g) The device's GCD curves flex at various angles (a). (h) A retention test that involved 1000 bends. The device is depicted in its bent state in the inset.48 
All four samples’ galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves (see Fig. 9(a–d)) show a non-linear charge/discharge profile with an almost triangular shape. The S,N-GQDP2 nanocomposite exhibits superior pseudocapacitive charge storage in addition to the EDLC. The Csp value of the S,N-GQDP2 nanocomposite is estimated to be around 645 F g−1, whereas the specific capacitance values for the pure PANI, S,N-GQDP1 and S,N-GQDP3 samples are, respectively, 177, 224, and 134 F g−1. In comparison to GQDs, heteroatom-doped S,N-GQDs often exhibit better specific capacitance, with sulfur and nitrogen atoms serving as sites for electrolyte ion trapping. Additionally, the doping of heteroatoms into the GQDs improves the sample's electrical conductivity even more. In addition to PANI, a similar polymer chitosan reported by Ramya Ramkumar et al.49 describes a study on the fabrication of CoMoO4 nanosheets modified with chitosan for use in energy storage supercapacitor devices. The CoMoO4 that was altered demonstrated remarkable electrochemical performance, yielding a specific capacitance of 135 F g−1 at 0.6 A g−1, as well as an energy density of 31 W h kg−1. Additionally, it exhibited commendable cycling stability with an elevated coulombic efficiency spanning over 2000 cycles, all while preserving a specific capacitance of 81 F g−1 at 3 A g−1.

(e) Pure PANI and S,N-GQDP nanocomposites current density vs. specific capacitance. (f) Nyquist plots of three distinct S,N-GQDP electrodes and pristine PANI (inset shows the high frequency region).48 
The combination of pseudocapacitor materials with nanosized quasi-zero-dimensional carbon materials can significantly enhance the functionality of the materials in energy storage systems. The mechanism behind this enhancement involves the high surface area, excellent conductivity, quantum confinement effects, and mechanical stability provided by the quasi-zero-dimensional carbon materials. Further research in this area is needed to fully understand and optimize the performance of these hybrid materials.50–52 A comparison of the capacitance performance of these materials can be tabulated as follows:

It should be noted that the performance of electrode materials can vary depending on factors such as the synthesis method, the size and shape of the quantum dots, and the composition of the polymer composite. Therefore, further research is needed to optimize the performance of these materials for supercapacitor applications (Fig. 10).
 Fig. 10  (a, b) Solid state supercapacitors’ electrolyte is composed of graphene quantum dots.77 
As solution- and solid-type electrolytes for supercapacitors, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with a large number of acid oxygen-bearing functional groups, such as –COOH and –OH, can be used. Moreover, we discovered that just neutralizing the acidic functional groups of the GQDs with KOH substantially increased their conductivity and ion-donating capacity. The capacitance efficiency and rate capability of the supercapacitors were significantly improved by employing these neutralizing GQDs as the solution-or solid-type electrolytes. The weak acidic oxygen-bearing reactive groups’ complete ionization following neutralization is the cause of the increase (Fig. 11).

In an H2SO4 electrolyte, the storage capacity of the material composed of nanocrystals and SP-derived carbon dots (CDs) was studied. Surprisingly, with increasing the amount of electrolyte, the specific capacity increased, reaching 643 mF cm−2. As a result, the addition of CDs to both the electrode and the electrolyte resulted in an overall improvement of 12.61% due to the beneficial synergistic effects of lowering series resistance, improving surface wettability.
3. Recent advancement of QDs for flexible supercapacitor
Various characterization approaches were used to characterize the synthesized GQDs. Electrochemical experiments were used to study the supercapacitive characteristics of GQDs.80 The electrode built of GQDs has a specific capacitance (SC) of 257 F g−1 at a current density of 3 A g−1 and a capacitance retention of 96% after 3000 cycles. A flexible symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) device was created using a simple fabrication approach with GQDs as the active material. After 1000 cycles (Fig. 12).

Fig. 13(a) displays the CV curves of the fabricated flexible device in the ideal possible window of 0–1.5 V and scanning speed range of 5–100 mV s−1. The CV curves have a nearly rectangular shape even at high scan rates. This proves that the fast reversible ion adsorption–desorption at the electrodes material's surface is the basis of the high energy storage mechanism, demonstrating the electrode material's dual-layer capacitive nature. Additionally, GCD experiments are carried out in the potential window of 0 to 1.5 V with varying high current density ranging from 3 to 50 A g−1 to assess its capacitive performance of the constructed flexible device and the results. The GCD curves’ symmetrical triangular shapes and minimal IR drops provide as another proof of the flexible device's capacity for high rates. At current densities of 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 A g−1, the flexible device's SC values are calculated using the GCD profile to be 55, 52, 50, 48, 39, 35, 31 and 28 F g−1, respectively. The decrease in the device's SC values at high current density is influenced by the GQDs’ longer ion diffusion length. The SC does not considerably decrease even at high current densities, showing that the flexible devices have high capacitance retention. The manufactured flexible device's rate capacity and stability are tested at 50 A g−1 for a continuously 1000 GCD cycles, which reveals increased device stability. The stability test is also supported by the EIS data for continuously 1000 GCD cycles, as shown in Fig. 13(c). Rct (0.85, 0.93) and Rs’ values have barely changed (0.78, 0.86). At different angles of bending, the device's rectangular shape exhibits a small distortion. It demonstrates that the bends of the manufactured device is mostly unaffected by the value of SC. These numbers surpass earlier data on carbon-based materials. As illustrated in Fig. 13(f), two symmetric flexible devices are actually connected in series, and after 20 seconds of charging, they emit a red light for 5 minutes.81

Solid-state electrolytes have been increasingly investigated as a promising alternative to traditional liquid electrolytes due to their several advantages. These advantages include higher thermal stability and safety, lower risk of leakage, and improved cycling performance and durability of batteries.82,83 Moreover, solid-state electrolytes exhibit compatibility with various electrode materials, making them ideal for high-performance batteries.84 QDs have not been used as liquid electrolytes due to their limited ionic conductivity, which is crucial for efficient ion transport in batteries.85 Instead, QDs have been utilized as active materials in solid-state electrolytes and electrodes in hybrid supercapacitors, offering improved performance compared to traditional materials.86,87 Therefore, while QDs offer promising potential in the field of energy storage, their application as liquid electrolytes are currently limited (Fig. 14).
 Fig. 14  (a–f) Supercapacitors made of very transparent and bendable graphene–graphene quantum dots.88 
Transparent and flexible power sources are necessary for transparent and flexible technologies to function as intended. Utilizing chelated graphene and graphene quantum dots (GQDs), we created new transparency and flexible micro-supercapacitors in the current work using a straightforward electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique.88 Remarkably, these supercapacitor devices displayed remarkable transparency (92.97 percent at 550 nanometers), high energy storage (0.9 F cm−2), a quick relaxation time (8.55 ms), steady cycle retention (approximately 100% for 10000 cycles), and good stability.

Electrochemical tests were used to define the G-GQDs material's energy storage effect. G-GQDs material was used to create an electrochemical cell, and to enhance the electrical contact, current collector (Cu tape) was put around the edges. PVA/H3PO4, an electrolyte in the form of a gel, was poured onto the G-GQDs’ exposed areas to coat them. An optical representation of a sandwich-type transparent G-GQDs energy storage cell with an illustration of its cell structure is shown in Fig. 15(a). The capacitance efficiency of the G-GQDs was initially evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 15a). Under a range of scan speeds (0.1–1.0 V s−1), the obtained CV curves were almost rectangular, indicating optimum lead to high performance during the charge–discharge cycle. A linear relationship was seen for the discharging process (Fig. 15b). The CV curves could keep their totally rectangular shape regardless of the scan rate because the G-GQDs material's rough surfaces and strong conductivity enable for quick diffusion of electrolyte ions from the deposited GQDs electrode (Fig. 15b).

(b) An illustration showing the manufactured ipG-GQDs-MSC structure under bending test. (c) CV curves that were gathered at 25 different scan rates. Galvanostatic charge–discharge waveforms at various current densities are collected in (d).88 
At lower or higher current densities, there is very little internal resistance (IR) reduction. This demonstrates that produced supercapacitors have extremely low internal resistance. This extremely little IR reduction suggests that no reactions occur and that the capacitance only arises as a result of the formation of EDL. This demonstrates that the charging time decreases more quickly as the current density rises than the discharge time does. At 0.6 mA cm−2, the charging and discharging times eventually balance out. The higher coulombic efficiency of the supercapacitor indicates a high level of reversibility. Similar findings were made by Pal et al., who discovered that coulombic efficiency rose from 91 to 100% when current density increased from 2.5 to 15 A g−1. The device's improved coulombic efficiency, which also exhibits great reversibility, is caused by strong OH ion transit over the sample. Fig. 16(d) makes clear that WS2 QD-based supercapacitors have higher areal-specific capacitance and longer discharge durations. Fig. 16 shows several bending angles at which the manufactured device's mechanical flexibility has been proven (a). While the device was bent at different angles, cyclic voltammograms and capacitance barely altered, indicating that the devices can be used in flexible applications. The devices’ cycle stability was determined by conducting cyclic charge–discharge tests up to 10000 times. After 10000 cycles, Fig. 16 shows the particular capacitance retention behaviour for devices incorporating WS2 QDs and NS-based materials Fig. 16(b). After 10000 cycles, it is found that for WS2 QDs-based devices.

The electrochemical properties of DP xerogel and MoS2 QDs were also measured for comparison. The CV curve (Fig. 17a) shows two separate peaks for the DP and DMP electrodes at 10 mV s−1, as before. The regions there under DMP CV curves are larger, and these peaks are attributable to the transit between different redox states. A design for building a flexible, all-solid-state SCs device is shown in Fig. 17(a), and films formed from DMP gel and stable SCs devices, respectively, are shown in Fig. 17(b) and (c). The two distinct peaks on the CV curve of the DMP electrode diverge from quasi-rectangle shapes and represent, respectively, the structural changes of leucoemeraldine to emeraldine and emeraldine to pernigraniline. The enhanced capacitance capabilities in DMP are mostly attributable to MoS2 QDs, which leads to a symbiotic association between MoS2 QDs and PANI chains. The DMP xerogel demonstrates increased electrochemical performance because its bigger surface area and micro- and meso-holes allow for more exposure of active chemicals to the electrolyte. Additionally, it enables greater ion movement, which promotes efficient and rapid charge transport, urges rapid redox reactions, and causes a notable rise in specific capacitance. (ii) Their synergistic interaction makes it easier for charges to move from the DP network to the MoS2 QDs within the DMP gel. (iii) The conductivity of the hybrid conductive PANI xerogel is increased by a necessarily increase the metallic 1T MoS2 QDs55 phase compared to 2H phase and a lower resistance. As compared to DP xerogel and MoS2 QDs, this increases specific capacitance. The maximum Csp of DMP SSC (331 F g−1) is significantly higher than the that of the specific capacitors of MoS2 QDs and DP xerogel, highlighting the importance of synergistic interaction in increasing the specific capacitance of DMP.
 Fig. 17  (a) A schematic for the construction of solid-state, flexible SCs using PANI xerogel; (b) and (c) are images of films made from DMP gel and solid-state SCs, respectively.89 
With GCD measurements at a current density of 2 A g−1, the cyclic stability of DMP xerogel-based solid state SCs has been confirmed. Fig. 18a inset shows the first five-cycle GCD curve and the five-cycle GCD curve after a 24-hour period indicating a minuscule decay. Its long-term cyclic stability is equivalent to that of nitrogen-doped graphene polyacrylic acid/polyaniline, PANI/CNT nanocomposite, polyaniline hydrogen, etc., proving its suitability as a capacitive material. DMP gel is the basis for all solid state electrodes. The Ragone plot of DMP gel is shown in Fig. 18(b) to illustrate the general performance of our constructed gadget. At a power density of 398 W kg−1, the flexible supercapacitor has a maximum energy density of 29.4 W h kg−1. The synergistic interaction between MoS2 QDs and PANI, as well as other factors, contribute to the superior energy and power density performance (Fig. 19).

 Fig. 19  The assembly of the N-GQD/GH/CF positive electrode and the GH/CF negative electrode into an asymmetric flexible fiber supercapacitor is shown schematically.90 
An efficient method for expanding the potential window has been shown to be an asymmetric electrode arrangement in order to improve the energy density of the FFSCs. N-GQD/GH/CF was used as the positive electrode, GH/CF served as the negative electrode, and PVA/H2SO4 hydrogel served as the electrolyte in the construction of the all-solid-state asymmetric FFSC. The volume of 0.0033 cm−3 (negative electrode) and 0.0012 cm−3 (positive electrode) were employed to maintain the charge balance in order to improve the electrochemical performance of the FFSC (see the Experiment section for details). The asymmetric N-GQD/GH/CF/GH/CF FFSC could be run steadily at various voltages, ranging from 1.6 V to 2.2 V, as illustrated in Fig. 20a. A wider potential window of 2 V is applied to account for the combined impact of electrical double-layer capacitance and pseudo-capacitance. The shape of the CV curves is unchanged even at a high scan rate (1000 mV s−1), demonstrating the device's capabilities for quick charged discharge. At a current density of 35.6 mA cm−3, the calculated effective volumetric and gravitic capacitance (Fig. 20c) can reach values of 6.6 F cm−3 and 36.9 F g−1, respectively. Fig. 20(d), which represents the device's Ragone plot, demonstrates that it has an excellent dimensional energy density of 3.6 mW h cm−3 at a battery capacity of 35.6 mW cm−3. Furthermore, 355.6 mW cm−3 of high-power density can be attained. These values for the volumetric energy density are greater than those of available commercially energy storage devices. Two FFSCs assembled in serial can light a common red LED to satisfy the requirements of the able to operate voltage and energy output for practical applications (inset of Fig. 20d). Flexibility is essential for the practical use of FFSCs as fiber-based energy storage systems. The bending test was conducted under various bending situations to help assess the N-GQD/GH/CF/GH/CF FFSC's applicability in the real world.92

4. Quantum dots composites for storage
The rapid need for energy storage devices in the market has urged for mass production and budget friendly synthesis of carbon dots (CDs). There has been numerous research going on to develop novel materials for energy storage devices like-batteries and supercapacitors.42 The performance of these energy devices highly depends on the nature of electrode materials. Researchers have found that carbonaceous materials showed exceptionally good electrochemical properties mainly due to their suitable structure.93 Among the various carbonaceous materials, graphene was widely employed for energy storage applications mainly due to their sp2-hybridized carbon atoms which exist in conjugated fashion. Graphene also exhibits certain other interesting features which includes-thermal and electrical properties, high surface area, chemical stability along with interesting mechanical properties as well. However, graphene sheets when cut down to a few nanometers gave exciting physicochemical properties and this gave rise to graphene quantum dots (GQDs).93
Since then, various cost-effective synthesis methodologies have been done where the researchers were successful in synthesizing GQDs without use of initiators, surfactants and toxic reagents.94 The addition of heteroatoms into CDs proved to increase electrochemical activities like OER/HER and conductivity. By enhancing the dimensions, researchers were able to tune the material to a greater extent to obtain desired properties.94 Some of the major advantages in using quantum dots like CDs and GQDs in energy storage can be well explained by three main reasons: (1) quantum dots have attractive properties which provide electron–hole pairs for electrical conductivity, surface area for functionalization and wettability for enhancing electrochemical properties. (2) Quantum dots can serve as precursors and templates to produce materials with distinct structures. (3) Quantum dots can be incorporated to diverse systems by-either adding directly during synthesis or created using in situ methods like electrophoretic deposition, hydrothermal or microwave-assisted techniques.94 Further detailed study and in-depth knowledge of the quantum dots can help us in building materials with exceptional electrochemical performance which makes them ideal for energy storage. Quantum dots composites are found to be the hottest topic in research when it comes to electrode materials in energy storage devices.
Carbonaceous materials have received a lot of attention recently for their use as innovative anode materials and in energy storage applications. Quantum dot composites are one of the many promising carbonaceous materials available today. A hydrothermal approach was used by Zhao et al. to manufacture graphene quantum dot-coated carbon nanotubes (GQD–CNT).95 The conductive qualities of both GQD and CNT were incorporated in the hybrid structure. After 100 cycles, the composite demonstrated a 700 mA h g−1 specific capacitance at 100 mA g−1. The material demonstrated good stability even at high current densities of 1000 mA g−1 after 350 cycles, a specific capacity of 483 mA g−1 was attained.95 The hybrid material, hence proved to be a good anode material for lithium-ion batteries showing fast redox reactions and outstanding rate and cycle stability.
The use of organic polymer composites with quantum dots (QDs) in supercapacitor (SC) applications has gained considerable attention in recent years due to their potential for enhancing the electrochemical performance of SCs. However, there is a need to explore the influence of QD morphology on the performance of these composite materials.96
A study conducted by Zhang et al.97 investigated the impact of QD morphology on the electrochemical performance of a composite material made from polyaniline (PANI) and CdS QDs. The authors found that the shape of the QDs significantly influenced the electrochemical properties of the composite material. They observed that CdS QDs with a rod-like morphology showed improved electrochemical performance compared to those with a spherical morphology.97 The higher surface area and greater accessibility of the rod-like QDs led to enhanced charge storage capacity and improved cycling stability. Similarly, another study by Chen et al.98 explored the use of a composite material made from poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and CdS QDs with different morphologies. The authors observed that the electrochemical performance of the composite material was strongly influenced by the shape of the QDs. They found that CdS QDs with a rod-like morphology showed higher specific capacitance and better cycling stability than those with a spherical morphology.
These studies highlight the importance of considering QD morphology in the design and synthesis of organic polymer composites for SC applications. Further research is needed to explore the influence of QD morphology on the performance of composite materials made from other organic polymers and QD materials.
Numerous works have been reported, where in the use of quantum dot composites as anode materials in various energy storage devices. Yet another work was carried out by Zhu and his team, in which they have synthesized metal oxide quantum dots anchored on nitrogen-rich graphene compact monoliths which results in rapid and high stability volumetric lithium/sodium storage (Fig. 21).
 Fig. 21  Graphene quantum dot wrapped carbon nanotube composite for energy storage.99 
The produced HD-TiO2-N-RGO compact monolith has a high electrical conductivity of 343.7 S m−1, a high density of 1.8 g cm−3, and porosity, all of which contribute to its superior rate capability at 10 or 5 A g−1 as anode in LIBs and SIBs, respectively. It is composed of well-dispersed and ultrasmall-sized TiO2 quantum dots (4.0 nm) anchored on N-RGO. The created quantum dot showed potential as a fast-acting, very stable volumetric energy storage medium (Fig. 22).
 Fig. 22  Schematic diagram of fabrication of HD-TiO2-N-RGO compact hybrid monolith.100 
Yet another interesting work was carried out with carbon quantum dot composite, in which they synthesized carbon quantum dot which was anchored on bismuth oxide (CQD–Bi2O3) by hydrothermal method.101 The CQD–Bi2O3 composite showed a discharge capacity of 1500 mA h g−1 at 0.2C rate, prominent specific capacity of about 343 C g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 3 M KOH solution.102 The prepared composite was then used for fabrication of an asymmetric supercapacitor with the CQD–Bi2O3 composite as the anode material and reduced graphene as cathode. The asymmetric supercapacitor delivered an energy density of 88 W h kg−1 at a power density of 2799 W kg−1, when the power density was elevated to maximum value of 8400 W kg−1 the device showed an energy density of 32 W h kg−1 (Fig. 23).

Yun and his team worked on synthesizing porous Fe2O3 modified with nitrogen doped carbon quantum dot/reduced graphene oxide composite (N-CQDs/rGO/Fe2O3).103 The composite with its high surface area and synergistic effect of appreciably high capacity have achieved good electrochemical properties. The N-CQDs/rGO composite with 34.9 wt% shows good rate capability (72.1, 58.9 and 46.2% of capacity retention at 5, 50 and 100 Ag−1 respectively while the N-CQDs/rGO/Fe2O3 with 62.3 wt% showed more good values in terms of capacitance of 274.1 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1.103
Research on energy storage devices will open a new horizon for creating a sustainable and renewable source of energy. The fabrication of such energy storage devices which are affordable and reliable can help in scale up and commercialization so as to research the society.104,105 There is still research going on in developing ideal materials for electrode fabrication which delivers exceptionally good electrochemical activity (Fig. 24).

The environmental issues of climate change and fossil fuel depletion are becoming more severe, and there is a growing market for energy storage and conversion. Environmental challenges like global climate change and depletion of fossil fuels are becoming more severe, necessitating increased energy transformation and storage requirements. Furthermore, we objectively examine quantum dots’ weaknesses in energy storage and conversion and forecast future development trends, problems, and opportunities.
5. Conclusion and future scope
The advancement in energy conversion and storage technologies over the past few decades has had a significant impact on the development of next-generation technology. Utilizing batteries and SCs is essential in cutting-edge electronics, and hopefully in the coming years, we will be relying more and more on them. SCs have been shown to be extremely dependable when used in a variety of real-time applications. Due to their advantageous qualities, such as excellent power density, longer cycle life, involvement of lower cost, etc., they have been shown to be an appropriate candidate for next-generation energy-oriented technologies, such as solar systems, faster trains, electric vehicles, and wind power equipment. To make its use more effective, scientists are still working to analyze and improve their qualities. In this review, we have focused on discussing various quantum dots (QDs) and nanocomposites used for SCs and have provided examples of each type's performance. Effective QD use has really led to increased performance efficiency in SCs. However, QDs have made excellent contributions in a variety of other applications as well, including those for battery electrode materials, medication delivery, biosensors, bioimaging, electrochemical devices, UV sensors, and others. In this review, we have honed in on the electrode materials based on quantum dots and their composites for storage and quantum dot based flexible devices that have been published up to this point.
