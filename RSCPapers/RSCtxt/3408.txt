    , Accepted 30th July 2012First published on 3rd August 2012AbstractNanowire, nanosheet and nanoflower supramolecular assemblies of fullerenes are constructed from self-organization of biphenyl and pyrene substituted PCBM. When 20 wt% PCBPy is blended into P3HT:PCBM as part of the acceptor, devices exhibit the best photovoltaic performance with PCE up to 4.8% by fine tuning of the morphology.
Donor–acceptor bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) solar cells formed by mixtures, such as regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), are bench-mark OPV structures,1 with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 5%. The approaches for improving the performance of P3HT/PCBM solar cells by changing the morphology of the active layer has been reported in the past, such as thermal annealing, solvent–vapor treatments, and the use of additives. The use of donor and acceptor additives2 has also been reported to broaden the absorption profile,3 enhance the carrier mobility and tune electronic energy levels of both the donor and acceptor materials.4 Moreover, a ternary blend method based on two donor components and one acceptor component (or one donor and two acceptors) have been recognized as a potential route to increase the absorption breadth of a solar cell and simultaneously tune the open-circuit voltage.5
Specifically, fullerene derivatives have been extensively used as an important building block for fabrication of functional supramolecular materials, with application in optoelectronic devices, over the past decades.6 Tailoring of the building block architectures aims to favor exciton dissociation and efficient transport. Therefore, fine morphology control of the active layer is the most challenging work, with various fullerene organized structures such as wires,7 flowerlike8 and discs9 object fabricated from chemically modified fullerene derivatives. In this study, we present a new class of modified PCBM derivative, where the ester methyl group has been replaced with mesogen units, to control the length-scale of polymer/fullerene phase segregation. Our method is based on replacing parts conventional fullerene electron acceptors PCBM, by self-assembling fullerene derivatives to form one-dimensional (1-D) crystalline domains within the active layer. Specifically, we examine a pair of fullerene derivatives that are chemically nearly identical (PCBPy and PCBbP) but whose molecular shapes either promote or hinder the formation of nanoscale phase separation. We hypothesize that incorporating these derivatives bearing nanosheet to form ternary blend of P3HT:PCBM would lead to better performance due to optimized phase segregation between polymers and fullerenes.
As shown in Fig. 1, two different side-chain-functionalized fullerene acceptors are synthesized in this study (details in ESI†). The product was characterized from 1H NMR, Raman spectra (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†) and mass spectrometry. Photovoltaic devices containing ternary blends in the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC61BM + PCBPy(or PCBbP)/LiF/Al configuration10 (as in the inset device depicts in light J–V curves) were fabricated in air. In order to compare the device parameters, all of the optimized devices had similar active layer thicknesses about 130 nm. Additionally, the overall ratio of polymer to fullerenes was maintained at 1:1, as was the solvent annealing (details in the ESI†) and thermal annealing temperature (150 °C). Table 1 lists the average values of VOC, JSC, FF, and η as the PCBM + PCBPy ratio is varied. Importantly, as is also illustrated in Fig. 1, the VOC values of the three-component solar cells show a continuous increase from 0.61 to 0.67 V as the amount of PCBPy increased to 100%. 20% PCBPy in the acceptor combination leads to the highest increase of device performance in the overall PCE (4.8%). We expect that these values can be optimized by further exploration of processing conditions, but for the purpose of examining the suitable blending, these efficiencies are adequate. However, the FF and JSC decrease as the ratio of PCBPy reaching to 40%; and thus causing an over-all PCE of a moderate 3.4%. Furthermore, if biphenyl-binding fullerene moieties (PCBbP) are introduced, the effect is inconspicuous and the VOC reduces to 0.57 V.

In addition to the tunable photocurrent, the dark current is reduced as the amount of PCBPy in the ternary blend increased. The adding of PCBPy can also reduce the electronic coupling between the donor and the acceptor molecules by increasing the spacing between them, and hence reduce the recombination. To directly probe charge recombination in solar cells containing the third components in the active layer, dark J–V curves of the device are presented (Fig. S3, ESI†). It is reported that VOC value is set by the maximum difference between Fermi energies of the active layer components, namely donor and acceptor. When the amount of PCBPy fullerene acceptor increases in the blends, the values of VOC are slightly increased. The series resistance (RS) of the devices is also lower in cells containing PCBPy compared to the reference P3HT:PC61BM and P3HT:PC61BM + PCBbP devices. This can be seen more clearly in the log–log representation of the dark curves (Fig. 1, inset), where higher dark injection currents are observed for devices with 20% PCBPy.11 We also find that device performance is relatively sensitive to the amount of the PCBPy concentration. It is evident from the semilog plots of the dark curves that the low PCBPy ratio (10% and 20%) yield higher rectifying values compared to reference cells; while high PCBPy content leads to decreased dark current.

Fig. 2 shows field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of self-organized architectures formed from the PCBM derivatives. The self-organized objects, mainly described in this manuscript, are easily prepared by dissolving derivatives in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB, 1 mM) under solvent annealing. It can be noted that nanowire objects with diameter distribution around 100 nm are formed from PCBbP; while PCBPy moieties are assembled into sheet-like nanostructures. However, the packed nanoshapes of the modified are totally changed after thermal treatment and flowerlike with size distribution about 400 nm and 1 μm are formed from PCBbP and PCBPy, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†).
 Fig. 2  SEM and TEM images of PCBbP assembled into a nanowire (A and C); and PCBPy into a nanosheet (B and D). The (C and D) insets are the optimized structure of PCBbP and PCBPy using DFT (B3LYP/6-31G*) method. 
In order to investigate the origin of the lower performance at high PCBPy contents and 20% PCBbP blending, the optical properties of blend films under solvent annealing at various fullerene ratios in thin films are studied using UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 3 and S5†). The introduction of PCBPy results in an increase in the absorption of the thin film at 300–500 nm that gets more pronounced as the amount of PCBPy in the blend increased. This increase can be explained using the absorption profiles of PC61BM, PCBPy and PCBbP (see the Fig. S6†), thus leading to an increase EQE between 300 nm and 500 nm and enhanced JSC. Besides, shoulders, located at the vibronic band at 560 and 600 nm around both became more significant for the PCBPy containing films than for pure P3HT:PCBM film, most distinct for 20% PCBPy. This shoulder is common for P3HT thin films and generally is ascribed to the interchain vibrational absorption induced by a high degree of ordering and strong interchain interaction.12 We refer that the crystalline of PCBPy may influence the amorphous region of P3HT where the P3HT domains contain approximately 20% of PCBM in the films.13

Particularly, the more distinct vibronic band of 20% PCBPy in the acceptor indicate the better structure than the annealed P3HT:PCBM film. The hole mobilites suggests that the ordering and planarity of P3HT backbone is improved by nanosheets adding, leading to the increased hole mobility and enhanced charge collection efficiency. Further increasing the content of PCBPy suppresses the interchain interaction of P3HT while nanowire or nanoflower fullerene domains are also less benefit. It suggests that the adding of assembling fullerene domains should correlate to the crystallinity of P3HT in the mixture.
To analysis the crystallinity of the active layer carefully, XRD pattern (Fig. S7, ESI†) of the P3HT:PCBM + PCBPy blends at various fullerene ratios have been recorded. All films, except the P3HT:PCBPy film, show the well ordered P3HT (100) (2θ about 5°) peak, which is related with the interchain of P3HT. Interestingly, the peak position observed in PCBPy (10%) cast film is slightly shifted to low angle as compared to the P3HT:PCBM cast film, which is more pronounced for the samples with higher contents of PCBPy. This indicates that the d spacing of P3HT becomes larger during the crystallization of P3HT.14 The increase in the crystallite size also provides further insight onto enhanced charge transport (Table 1) and also provides high internal effective field for charge separation, resulting in higher value of PCE. Furthermore, the crystal size of the nanosheet can be estimated through the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD diffraction peaks in the (200) reflection with the Scherrer formula. The sheet crystallite sizes are 25.2, 42.7, and 110.3 nm for the 20%, 40%, and 100% blends, respectively,15 and these values are consistent with those estimated by TEM. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of thin films of donor polymers and their blends with (PCBM and PCBM + PCBPy) are shown in Fig. S8.† The degree of the PL quenching (Fig. S8, ESI†) is more distinct for the P3HT:PCBM + PCBPy (10% and 20%) films as compared to the P3HT:PCBM. The ordered phase of P3HT chains seems to promote PCBM molecules from being miscible mixed with the polymer chains, leading to more efficient interaction between them, so more quenching of P3HT emission. It has been reported that the PL is quenched more effectively in densely packaged layer because of shorter intermolecular distances.16
The detailed morphologies of the phase separation of the acceptors and P3HT were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 4). Control of the nanoscale morphology of the P3HT/PCBM blend results in optimized phase separation for efficient charge separation and transport and, thereby, leads to high-efficiency solar cells. The morphology of the phase separation in ternary blend films can be fine tuned with help from the PCBPy nanosheets. However, with the content of PCBPy increasing from 20% to 100%, the nanosheet size of PCBPy domains becomes larger (even up to μm), which suppresses the nanocrystal formation of P3HT. Besides the control of nanosheet sizes, the various ratios of acceptor in the ternary devices lead to morphology changes at the interface area (Fig. S9, ESI†). The homogeneous blends and well-mixed films in pure P3HT:PCBM films turn to proper nanoscale phase separation in P3HT:PCBM + PCBPy (20%) without thermal treatment.

In conclusion, various organized fullerene structures have been developed by self-assembly of a simple PCBM derivative that bears biphenyl and pyrene mesogen to form PCBbP and PCBPy. There are two main causes of the PCE change in the incorporation of various fullerene derivatives, enhanced absorption and nanoscale morphology. The different self-organization of fullerenes leads to the change in the morphology with various nanoscale phase separation and interface area. The VOC and JSC values of the optimal BHJ devices based on P3HT:PCBM + PCBPy (20%) blend reach 0.64 V and 11.4 mA cm−2, respectively, leading to an overall PCE of 4.8%, which is significantly improved as compared to a BHJ device based on P3HT:PCBM. The significantly enhanced JSC and hole mobilites of the thermal-free devices can be attributed to an increase EQE at 300–500 nm and decrease charge recombination. Since the adding of nanosheets PCBPy may better promote the formation of nanoscale phase separation of donor and acceptor than adding of nanowires. However, higher content of PCBPy and thermal treatment would disrupt the advantageous formation of P3HT lamellae within this ternary mixture.
