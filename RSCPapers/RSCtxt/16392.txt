    , Accepted 22nd September 2016First published on 23rd September 2016AbstractThe electronic, optical and hole transport properties of three new hole transporting materials (HTMs) with a planar core have been investigated by using density functional theory and Marcus theory. A reliable semi-rational formula was adopted to calculate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of new HTMs. The results showed that the HOMO levels of new HTMs were 0.07–0.30 eV lower than those of Spiro-OMeTAD, and their absorption peaks appeared outside or close to the visible region and overlapped slightly with the absorption band of perovskites. Moreover, the Stokes shifts of the designing molecules were calculated to lie in a range from 72 to 124 nm, meaning that they could undergo large geometrical changes on excitation. More importantly, the hole mobility of new HTMs (0.099–0.27 cm2 v−1 s−1) was approximately two orders of magnitude higher than that of Spiro-OMeTAD (0.0056 cm2 v−1 s−1) due to strong hole coupling from a face-to-face packing pattern. Our results indicated that planar core-based HTMs could become potential candidates to replace the widely established Spiro-OMeTAD.
Since the first report in 2009,1 organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention due to their low material cost, simple configuration, and excellent photovoltaic performance. In subsequent years, devices based on such materials have shown an unparalleled increase of power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% to 22.1%.2–4
In PSCs, a hole-transporting material (HTM) plays an important role in facilitating hole transport from the valence band of perovskites to the back contact and impeding back electron transfer as well.5 Until now, small organic molecule 2,2-7.7-tetrakis(N,N′-di-para-methoxy-phenyl-amine) 9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) has been widely utilized for the fabrication of PSCs, exhibiting a high PCE surpassing 20%.6–8 However, Spiro-OMeTAD suffers from the expensive synthetic cost and poor hole mobility, which limits its practical applications. Therefore, it is imperative to design and synthesize more efficient and economical alternatives for successful commercialization of PSCs. Recently, a rich body of HTMs have been reported in combination with perovskites from polymers to organic small molecules. For the latter, different cores have been used in the state-of-the-art HTMs, such as 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene,9 truxene,10 benzotrithiophene,11 1,3,4-oxadiazole,12 fluorene-9,9′-xanthene,13 triazine,14,15 azulene,16 thiophene,17 and so on.
In this study, we present a new family of easily designed HTMs based on an anthrax-[1,2-b:4,3-b′:5,6-b′′:8,7-b′′′]tetrathiophene (ATT)18 as a core endowed with p-methoxydiphenylamine (ATT-1), p-methoxytriphenylamine (ATT-2), and N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-amino-N-diphenyl (ATT-3). The ATT core shows a D2 symmetry, and the coplanar structure of ATT is foreseen to promote an effective π–π intermolecular interaction, which could eventually lead to efficient hole transport behavior. All new designing molecules are shown in Fig. 1. The molecular neutral ground-state geometries are optimized by density functional theory with B3LYP functional (UB3LYP for cations) and 6-31G(d,p) basis set in dichloromethane solvent, based on the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM), as implemented in the Gaussian 09 program.19

In order to maximize the hole injection processes and open circuit voltage of the device, it is essential to have a good energy alignment between the HTM and the perovskite. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of all the investigated molecules are calculated by using a reliable semi-rational formula.20 The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level can be estimated by adding its excitation energy to the HOMO level.20Fig. 2 displays HOMO and LUMO distributions and energy levels of HTMs. As shown in Fig. 2, the HOMOs are fully delocalized within the whole molecules for Spiro-OMeTAD, ATT-1, and ATT-2, while the HOMO of ATT-3 is mostly localized across the four N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-amino-N-diphenyl units. In terms of LUMOs, all investigated molecules show similar distribution diagrams, which is mainly localized on the central Spiro-unit or ATT core. The calculated HOMO levels given in Fig. 2 indicate that an additional phenyl ring between the ATT core and an electron donating moiety stabilized HOMO levels by 140 meV and 90 meV, moving from ATT-1 to ATT-2 and from ATT-2 to ATT-3, respectively. The result implies that the size of the electron donating moiety plays an important role in adjusting the HOMO levels of materials, and a larger electron donating moiety provides lower HOMO levels. The tendency can also be found in an experimental study.21 Furthermore, the HOMO levels are calculated as −5.16, −5.30, and −5.39 eV for ATT-1, ATT-2, and ATT-3, respectively, suggesting that the HOMO levels of new designing molecules are more stabilized compared with that of Spiro-OMeTAD. On the other hand, the HOMO levels of ATT derivatives are higher than the valence band maximum of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV), indicating that they have an efficient hole extraction capability. Hence, when used as new HTMs in the PSCs, higher open circuit voltages are expected as the open-circuit voltage is relative to the difference between the quasi-Fermi levels of TiO2 and the HOMO level of HTM, a bigger difference implies a higher open-circuit voltage. Additionally, PSC based-new HTMs may also yield large short-circuit current density, which have a superlinear increase as the HOMO levels of HTMs decrease.22

For LUMO levels, it is found that their value gradually decreases as the size of the electron donating moiety increases. Moreover, the calculated LUMO levels are −2.22, −2.67, and −2.75 eV for ATT-1, ATT-2, and ATT-3, respectively. As a consequence, we believe that this larger energy barrier (1.16–1.90 eV) between the conduction band of perovskites (such as CH3NH3PbI3, −3.91 eV) and the LUMO of HTMs would block the electrons efficiently from perovskites to the metal electrodes and thus largely reduce the recombination chance.
Taking into consideration the appropriate HOMO and LUMO levels, the three new ATT derivatives seem to be good candidates as HTMs to improve the performance of PSCs.
Except suitable energy levels, transparency in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum and large Stokes shift are also typical features for a good HTM. To characterize the optical properties of the investigated molecules, we performed time dependent-DFT calculations on the ground-state and excited-state structures optimized in dichloromethane. The excited-state geometries of new HTMs are optimized at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. The absorption properties are evaluated with the MPW1K functional and 6-31G(d,p) basis set. The method is reasonable and capable of evaluating the absorption properties of phenylamine-type molecules.23,24 The maxima absorption peak position (vertical solid lines with arrow, λabs), maxima emission peak position (vertical dotted lines with arrow, λemi), and Stokes shifts (horizontal dotted lines with arrow) of the investigated molecules are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3, the calculated maxima absorption peak of Spiro-OMeTAD is at 346 nm, which is close to the experimental value with 383 nm.25 For new HTMs, we find that the maxima absorption peaks of ATT derivatives range from 364 to 420 nm, which are shown to be red-shifted by 18–74 nm compared with that of Spiro-OMeTAD. The results imply that in all cases the absorption takes place outside or close to the visible region and overlaps slightly with the absorption band of perovskites. The maxima emission peaks are at 488, 492, and 481 nm for ATT-1, ATT-2, and ATT-3, respectively, which is 91–102 nm red-shifted compared with the maxima emission of Spiro-OMeTAD with 390 nm (experimental value with 419 nm). According to the maxima absorption peak and maxima emission peak, the Stokes shift can be calculated by using the following expression: Stokes shift = λemi − λabs.

Stokes shift can reflect the degree of structural deformation between the ground state and excited state geometries. A larger Stokes shift is beneficial for pore-filling of HTM.9,26 As shown in Fig. 3, the Stokes shift of Spiro-OMeTAD is 44 nm, which is in good agreement with the experimental value of 33 nm.27 Stokes shifts follow the trend ATT-1 (124 nm) > ATT-3 (75 nm) > ATT-2 (72 nm) > Spiro-OMeTAD (44 nm). The result suggests that new designing ATT derivatives as HTMs are better for increasing the performance of PSCs compared with Spiro-OMeTAD. Interestingly, we also find that although Spiro-OMeTAD and ATT-1 have the same arms as p-methoxydiphenylamine, the Stokes shift of ATT-1 is larger than that of Spiro-OMeTAD by 80 nm. The result allows us to conclude that the planar core is more beneficial to increasing the Stokes shift of the HTM compared with the Spiro-core since the Spiro-unit ensures a great rigidity.
Many studies28,29 have pointed out that the faster hole mobility is responsible for larger short-circuit current density and higher fill factor of PSC. Hence, obtaining reliable hole mobility is an important step to develop efficient HTM. Marcus theory and the Einstein relationship are employed to calculate the hole mobility of HTMs. The Einstein relationship has been widely used to analyze the carrier mobility of organic molecules, and reliable results can be reproduced, especially for planar organic molecules. For example, Shi et al. calculated the carrier transport properties of tetrathiafulvalene derivatives, and they found that the calculated electron and hole mobilities agree reasonably well with the experimental one for DB-TTF and DN-TTF.30 In the present work, the hole transport pathways are simplified from three-dimension to one-dimension. It should be pointed out that the one-dimensional pathway selected has the lowest energy of dimers in all possible hole transport pathways. A previous study20 has shown that the more stable dimers have larger hole transfer integrals. The hole transport pathway with large hole transfer integral determines the hole mobility of a molecule. The computational methods of obtaining stable dimers and calculating molecular hole mobility are listed in the ESI.† To further determine the reliability of the simplified method, we take Spiro-OMeTAD, tris[N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-biphenyl]amine (OMeTPA-TPA),31 and HTM132 as models to calculate their hole mobility. The relevant data are listed in Table S1.† The result shows that the predicted (uc(Spiro-OMeTAD) = 5.56 × 10−3 cm2 v−1 s−1, uc(HTM1) = 1.33 × 10−6 cm2 v−1 s−1, and uc(OMeTAD-TPA) = 5.75 × 10−4 cm2 v−1 s−1) and experimental hole mobility (ue(Spiro-OMeTAD) = 1.30 × 10−3 cm2 v−1 s−1, ue(HTM1) = 6.00 × 10−6 cm2 v−1 s−1, and ue(OMeTAD-TPA) = 1.08 × 10−4 cm2 v−1 s−1) are of the same order of magnitude. It is obvious to conclude that the simplified method is reasonable and capable of evaluating the hole mobility of organic materials. Su's study33 also supports our conclusion above, their calculation pointed out that the carrier mobility obtained by the optimized geometry of the major pathway is in good agreement with the experimental value. The stable dimers of ATT derivatives are shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† The hole mobility of ATT derivatives and Spiro-OMeTAD is shown in Fig. 4 and Table S2 of the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 4, the hole mobilities of ATT-1 (0.13 cm2 v−1 s−1), ATT-2 (0.27 cm2 v−1 s−1), and ATT-3 (0.099 cm2 v−1 s−1) are approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher compared with Spiro-OMeTAD (0.0056 cm2 v−1 s−1). This can be explained by the fact that the ATT derivatives with a planar core have a large transfer integral (see Table S2†) between adjacent dimers due to short centroid to centroid distances and strong π–π interactions. A previous study also has proved that the planar and fully conjugated molecule enables investigated materials to have ordered assemblies for better charge transport in the film state.10 Additionally, sulfur–sulfur interactions can also strongly affect the packing model of molecules and are beneficial to enhance the charge transport rate, which is consistent with a previous work that the corresponding S⋯S distances in stacked dimers are inversely proportional to hole mobility.34 The higher hole mobility of new designing molecules allows them to function as effective HTMs without the need of an extra doping process, which significantly simplifies device fabrication and improves the stability of PSC.

For new designing materials, the solubility and stability should also be considered. The solubility of a material can be predicted by using solvation free energy (ΔGsolv). The definition of solvation free energy is the difference in free energy of the solute in the solution and gas phases.35 The more negative solvation free energy is, the more soluble the material is. In the present work, the solvent is dichloromethane and the solvation free energy is calculated according to the Coote's report.35 The calculated ΔGsolv value of Spiro-OMeTAD is −23.9 kcal mol−1, the ΔGsolv values of ATT-1, ATT-2, and ATT-3 are −23.1, −27.2, and −31.8 kcal mol−1, respectively. The result shows that ATT-1 has similar solubility with Spiro-OMeTAD, while ATT-2 and ATT-3 possess higher solubility than Spiro-OMeTAD. The stability of an organic semiconductor can be estimated by absolute hardness (η),36 which is calculated using the operational definition given by: η = (IP − EA)/2.37 EA represents the adiabatic electron affinity and IP denotes the adiabatic ionization potential. We calculate the absolute hardness of Spiro-OMeTAD and ATT derivatives, and the relevant data are listed in Table S3 of the ESI.† As shown in Table S3,† ATT derivatives have approximate η values (1.23–1.25 eV), which implies that they have similar stability. Moreover, we also find that the η values of ATT derivatives are slightly smaller compared with that of Spiro-OMeTAD (1.62 eV). The difference between the η values of Spiro-OMeTAD and ATT derivatives only is about 0.38 eV. The result indicates that the stability of ATT derivatives is comparable to that of Spiro-OMeTAD.
From an experimental viewpoint, we believe that newly designed HTMs can be synthesized, and the conjectural synthetic pathways are given in Fig. 5 according to previous reports.11,15 As shown in Fig. 5, p-methoxydiphenylamine can be introduced by the Buchwald–Hartwig amination reaction to obtain ATT-1. Three p-methoxytriphenylamine units can be covalently linked to the ATT core by a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction to obtain ATT-2. The ATT-3 can be synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction of N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-4′-(trimethylstannyl)biphenyl-4-amine with bromination of ATT.

Conclusions
In conclusion, three new HTMs were designed by introducing p-methoxydiphenylamine, p-methoxytriphenylamine, and N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-amino-N-diphenyl units onto the D2 ATT-core. The frontier molecular orbital energies and optical properties were studied by using density functional theory and time dependent density functional theory. Results suggested that three ATT derivatives have deeper energy levels and larger Stokes shifts compared to Spiro-OMeTAD. The planar and fully conjugated D2 HTMs resulted in more excellent hole mobility than Spiro-OMeTAD, the hole mobility of new HTMs (0.099–0.27 cm2 v−1 s−1) was approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher compared to Spiro-OMeTAD (0.0056 cm2 v−1 s−1). According to the above data, we believe that ATT derivatives can be used as efficient candidates to replace the state-of-the-art Spiro-OMeTAD. Our work opens up the potential incorporation of the planar core into HTMs to explore high-efficiency PSCs in the future.
