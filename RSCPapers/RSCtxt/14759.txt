    , Accepted 20th November 2022First published on 7th December 2022AbstractAlthough the hot-casting (HC) method can obtain efficient quasi-2D perovskite solar cells, this method cannot effectively control the uniformity of the thin film, and the high preheating substrate temperature will also form low n perovskite phases (n = 2) at the interface, which is not conducive to the transport of carriers. Semitransparent solar cells have great application prospects in building-integrated photovoltaic and tandem devices. Herein, a non-preheating (NP) film-casting method is proposed to realize a highly uniform and phase controllable quasi-2D perovskite film (BA2MA3Pb4I13, BA+:C4H11NH3+, MA+:CH3NH3+). As a result, the NP-processed film gets the highest light utilization efficiency (LUE = 4.01%) for semitransparent quasi-2D perovskite solar cells (ST-Quasi-2D-PSCs) with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.60%, average visible transmittance (AVT) of 41.73%, good bifaciality factor, high LUE in low light intensity and good stability.
Semitransparent solar cells have generated great research interest because of their potential application in building-integrated photovoltaic and tandem devices, which can deliver energy conservation and zero-energy buildings.1 Perovskites (ABX3) have been identified as ideal candidates for semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST-PSCs).2,3 The band gap, structure and thickness of the perovskite layer will affect the average visible transmittance (AVT) of the perovskite film, and there are four main ways to obtain semitransparent perovskite (ST-PVK): (a) ultrathin ST-PVK,4 (b) microstructured ST-PVK,5 (c) nanostructured ST-PVK,6 and (d) wide bandgap ST-PVK.7 At present, reducing the thickness of perovskite films and using wide-bandgap perovskites are the two most commonly used methods to obtain high PCE and AVT ST-PSCs.
3D perovskites are inherently unstable.8 Quasi-2D perovskites are formed by incorporating bulky organic cations at the A site with the formula of , which can block water and oxygen molecules, prevent phase transitions, limit ion migration, and improve the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs).9 The inorganic slabs of metal halide octahedral [BX6]4− are separated by species with a diverse layer thickness (n value), and the n values can change the band gap of the perovskite.10 Usually, there are multiple n value perovskite phases in the 2D perovskite layer (n ≥ 3) prepared by the solvent method, and the high n value perovskite phases tend to be distributed on the film surface, while the low n perovskite value phases tend to be distributed on the substrate side. The lower n perovskite phases (n = 1, 2) tend to be aligned parallel to the substrate, hinder carrier transport and are not conducive to carrier transport.11,12
At present, in order to obtain efficient quasi-2D PSCs, there are two commonly used strategies: (a) change the phase distribution. Vacuum Poling makes the different n value perovskite phase uniformly distribute in the perovskite film.13 Adding additives (MACl, PbCl2 and H2O etc.) to the precursor solution enables the high n value perovskite phase in the perovskite layer to form an effective transport channel, and high efficiency is obtained.14–16 These strategies can effectively avoid the low n phase blocking carrier transmission. (b) Get highly perpendicular orientation. Mohite and co-workers firstly used a “hot-casting” (HC, preheating the substrate before spin-coating the perovskite precursor solution) method to improve the perpendicular orientation of the quasi-2D perovskite films.17 Currently, most of the high power conversion efficiency (PCE) quasi-2D PSCs use the HC method. But the HC method usually requires a higher substrate preheating temperature, and the uniformity and repeatability of the prepared film are low.18
In this work, we report a non-preheating (NP) method to fabricate stable semitransparent quasi-2D perovskite solar cells (ST-Quasi-2D-PSCs). This NP method can effectively inhibit the formation of low n value 2D perovskite phases for the HC method, and the prepared film is also more uniform than that of the HC method. Finally, an ST-Quasi-2D-PSC with the best light utilization efficiency (LUE = PCE × AVT) of 4.01%, a PCE of 9.60% and an AVT of 41.73% was obtained.
We constructed opaque perovskite solar cells (O-PSCs) with a structure of glass/FTO/NiOX/PVK/PCBM/BCP/Ag to easily compare the electrical performance, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). We first studied the relationship between the substrate preheating temperature and the PCE of the O-PSCs (PCE*), the AVT (400–800 nm) of the perovskite film (AVT*) and the light utilization efficiency (LUE* = PCE* × AVT*) of the film, as shown in Fig. 1(a) The concentration of the precursor solution was 0.65 M, the AVT* decreases from 50.99% with NP (25 °C) film casting to 34.45% at 65 °C (H65, preheating the substrate to 65 °C), and the UV-visible absorption spectrum is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The increase of the substrate preheating temperature leads to the increase of the perovskite film thickness, which is the main reason for the decrease of AVT. The film thickness is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The NP process O-PSCs got a PCE of 10.37%. The O-PSCs prepared by preheating the substrate at 45 °C (H45) obtained the highest PCE of 11.45%, due to the increase of the JSC. The PCE of the cell dropped to 10.63% at H65, due to the fact that the JSC was not increasing and the FF and VOC dropped; the J–V curves are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The film prepared by H65 has the strongest light absorption, but the performance of the cell is not as good as those of NP and H45. Eventually, under the trade-off between AVT and PCE, we got the best LUE* with the NP film casting method, with the data of AVT*, PCE* and LUE* shown in Table S1 (ESI†).

To understand the effect of HC and NP on quasi-2D perovskite perpendicular orientation, we examined the effect of substrate temperature on the crystallization of perovskite films by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 1(b). Two dominant peaks were observed at the diffraction angles (2θ) of 14.1° and 28.4° in these films corresponding to the (111) and (202) lattice planes, respectively. As the substrate preheating temperature increased, the ratio of (202) and (111) increased. Therefore, under the condition of H65, the perpendicular orientation of the (202) planes parallel to the substrate was dominant, and the organic cation BA+ is less distributed in the direction parallel to the substrate, which is beneficial to the vertical transport of carriers.17 The (202)/(111) ratios are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). Although, as we noted above, the JSC, VOC and FF under H65 conditions were lower than those under H45 conditions. This shows that the perpendicular orientation of the perovskite film may not be the most critical factor affecting the cell performance.
We prepared perovskite films on glass/FTO/NiOX and tested them for steady-state photoluminescence (PL) from both the back side and front side to explore the phase distribution. Excited from the front and back side, the NP and H45 cast films showed a dominant luminescence peak at ≈738 nm, and the H65 cast films showed a dominant luminescence peak at ≈746 nm and the highest peak intensity, which indicates that the carriers generated by illumination cannot be efficiently transported to the hole transport layer (HTL), as shown in Fig. 1(c and d) and Fig. S5 (ESI†). Excited from the back side, the other luminescence peak with a value of 611 nm, which is the 2D perovskite phase with n = 3 value, appeared on the substrate side, and a peak of n = 2 phase with a wavelength of 573 nm appeared when the substrate preheating temperature was H65. This shows that the phase of the quasi-2D perovskite film gradually changes from near the substrate side with low n value phase to the film surface with high n value phase. In order to rule out whether the 2D phase of n = 2 appears because the film prepared at 0.65 M + H65 is too thick, the thin film prepared under the condition of 0.25 M + H65 also has a peak of n = 2, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). When preparing perovskite films, a supersaturated solution is first formed at the interface between the solution and air, and the perovskite phase with high n value tends to precipitate first.19 Therefore, when the crystallization process reaches the substrate from top to bottom, the remaining BA+ are more, which makes the formation of low n value phases more likely. The HC method will leave more BA+ when the crystallization process reaches the bottom, and thus is more inclined to form a lower 2D phase than the NP method. The low n value phase will limit the transport of carriers. Based on the results of the PL test, on the side close to NiOX, the 2D perovskite phase with low n value is mainly distributed, and on the side close to the PCBM, the high n value phase is mainly in contact with the PCBM. H65 has n = 2 phase at the interface with NiOX, while the films prepared under other conditions have no obvious n = 2 phase. This shows that the NP method can effectively control the generation of low n phase. The energy levels of the quasi-2D perovskite are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†).
The film morphology was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The films prepared by HC have fewer pinholes and larger grains, showing the advantages of HC in film morphology. Therefore, we believe that the main advantage of the NP method is that it can effectively avoid the formation of low n phase, as shown in Fig. S8(a–c) (ESI†). Films prepared under all conditions achieved lower RMS, as shown in Fig. S8(d–f) (ESI†).
To better understand the physical differences in perovskite films with different phase distributions, we used light intensity-dependent VOC measurements to understand the charge recombination loss during the operation of the device, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Based on the linear fittings to the plot of VOCversus light intensity (in semilogarithmic scale), we got an ideal factor nid = kBT/q, where nid = 1 represents direct bimolecular recombination, and nid = 2 indicates that a Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination dominated. The opaque cells with the NP film-casting method have the lowest nid (1.30 kBT/q), and this suggested that monomolecular recombination is inhibited.20 The opaque cells with the HC film-casting method have higher nid. It is speculated that the n = 2 2D phase of the perovskite (contact with NiOX and parallel to the substrate) will limit carrier transport, and makes it easier for electrons to recombine with holes at the interface,21 resulting in a higher slope. The internal charge transport resistance was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 2(b) exhibits the Nyquist plot under 1 V bias in a dark box at frequencies from 106 to 10−1 Hz. The fitted results are displayed in Table S3 (ESI†). The Rs is series resistance, and Rct and C represent charge transfer resistance and capacitance in the analog circuit diagram, respectively. The lowest Rs and Rct value is obtained at NP, indicating the faster charge transportation.22 With the increase of the preheating temperature, both Rs and Rct increased, especially when the preheating temperature increases to 65 °C, giving the highest Rs and Rct. The weak carrier transport ability is mainly due to the 2D perovskite with low n phase at the interface. The weak carrier transport ability makes the JSC not increase with the improvement of the light absorption ability.

In order to compare the uniformity of films prepared by HC and NP, we adopted the strategy of 0.25 M + H65 to fabricate solar cells with similar transparency (as shown in Fig. S9, ESI†) to that under 0.65 M + NP conditions, as shown in Fig. 2(c and d) and Fig S10 (ESI†). There is thermal inhomogeneity in the HC method, which can lead to differences in the crystallization of the film at different locations.18 The J–V curves of films prepared at 0.25 M + H65 vary greatly at different positions, while the film prepared with the NP film-casting method is very uniform. The poor thermal uniformity of the HC method is magnified when fabricating thinner films. Therefore, the NP strategy is more suitable than HC to fabricate highly transparent quasi-2D perovskite solar cells by reducing film thickness.
The NP strategy was used to prepare perovskite thin films and construct ST-Quasi-2D-PSCs with a structure of glass/FTO/NiOX/PVK/PCBM/BCP/1 nm Ag/IZO/Ag, as shown in Fig. 3(a and b). The device showed an AVT of 41.73%, as shown in Fig. 3(c). When illuminated from the glass side and IZO side, the best fresh cell showed a PCE of 8.71% and 7.33%, and the bifaciality factor was 84.2%, as shown in Fig. 3(d) and Table S4 (ESI†). The decrease in PCE when incident from the IZO side is mainly due to the loss of current caused by the absorption of light by the IZO and the PCBM. The integrated JSC of the pristine ST-Quasi-2D-PSCs calculated from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is 11.20 mA cm−2, matching with J–V measurements, as shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†).

An aging test was performed on the ST-Quasi-2D-PSCs. The unsealed device kept in air with 15 ± 10% relative humidity (RH) at room temperature in the dark still retained 80% PCE after 672 h; then, the cell was put in a nitrogen glovebox at 60 °C, and the cell would be repaired, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The unencapsulated device was kept in a nitrogen glovebox at 60 °C for 1104 h, and the PCE of the cell increased first and then remained stable, showing extreme thermal stability, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The PCE of the thermal stability test cell increased from the initial 7.98% to 9.60% with a JSC of 11.86 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.21 V, and an FF of 67.08% after 600 h, and the LUE was 4.01%; this is the highest LUE achieved by ST-Quasi-2D-PSCs so far. The improvement in PCE is mainly due to the increase of VOC and FF, as shown in Fig. 4(c) and Table S5 (ESI†). The J–V curves with different light intensity illumination of the ST-Quasi-2D-PSC are shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). When the light intensity decreased to 9.32 mW cm−2, the PCE of the cell increased to 10.93%, and the LUE reached 4.56%; this is a very high LUE value, as shown in Fig. 4(d). The cell also kept a good bifaciality factor, as shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). When semitransparent solar cells are used for building-integrated photovoltaics, the light intensity is often lower than 100 mW cm−2, and the better utilization of low light energy by such ST-Quasi-2D-PSCs shows their potential application in building-integrated photovoltaics.

In summary, we adopted a convenient NP method to prepare quasi-2D perovskite thin films, which effectively avoided the disadvantage of non-uniformity of thin films fabricated by the HC method. Moreover, the films prepared with the NP method will not form a low n 2D perovskite phase, which is beneficial to the transport of carriers. Employing the high quality BA2MA3Pb4I13 thin film with the NP film-casting method, we successfully fabricated n = 4 ST-Quasi-2D-PSCs with good wet and thermal stability, retaining a PCE of 9.60%, AVT of 41.73% and LUE of 4.01% after 600 h storage at 60 °C in nitrogen. The device not only has high bifaciality factor but also has higher PCE and LUE in low light intensity. This work shows great potential for the preparation of ST-Quasi-2D-PSCs with an easy NP film-casting method.
