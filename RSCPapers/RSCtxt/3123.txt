    , Accepted 25th January 2021First published on 8th February 2021AbstractDesigning non-noble-metal electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and stability towards hydrogen evolution reaction is vitally necessary for the demands of renewable and clean energy sources. Herein, an advanced water reduction electrocatalyst with a two-dimensional (2D) morphology based on CoP embedded on the surface of nanocarbon (CoP@C) is fabricated, which is derived from 2D Co-MOF by low-temperature phosphorization. Benefiting from the unique 2D morphology as well as more exposed (211) facet, such electrocatalyst exhibits superior catalytic activity in both alkaline and acid media in comparison to the traditional three-dimensional (3D) structure CoP@C with the overpotentials of 127 and 236 mV for HER at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Density functional theory simulations unveil that the binding energies of the adsorbed intermediate species become more appropriate on the (211) facet compared with that on the (011) facet. This could improve the dissociation of H2O and desorption of H*, and thus facilitate the electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, the 2D electrocatalyst demonstrates enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction performance compared with its 3D counterparts. When the 2D CoP@C is employed as both the anode and cathode, a potential of 1.67 V is required to achieve the 10 mA cm−2 current density. In addition, it still exhibits good durability and even continued to work for 50 h.
1 Introduction
Due to the ever-increasing environmental pollution and consumption of traditional fossil fuel, demands for the production of clean energy grow globally.1–3 Hydrogen (H2), a promising candidate as a future energy source, is wildly recognized to be an efficient form for energy conversion and storage because of its high calorific value and only water as the product of combustion.4–6 Among numerous H2 production methods, electrochemical water splitting is one of the most efficient routes because the electrical energy can be achieved ultimately from solar and wind power.7–9 The electrolysis of water consists of two half-reactions, namely hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Currently, Pt-based catalysts are considered to the best catalysts for HER, while Ru/Ir-based catalysts exhibit excellent performance for OER.10–12 However, the natural scarcity and high cost of these noble metals extremely limit their large-scale applications.13–15 To this end, designing highly efficient catalysts composed of cheap and earth abundant elements is of great significant for electrocatalysis water splitting.
In recent years, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have received considerable attention as electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their hydrogenase-like catalytic mechanism and high theoretical specific capacity.16–18 Hitherto, different types of TMPs (M = Fe,19,20 Co,21 Ni,22 Mo,23 Cu24 and W25) have been synthesized and applied for HER and OER. In the ways of enhancing their catalytic activity, the structures and compositions of these electrocatalysts are adjusted to expose more active sites.26,27 According to previous reports, TMPs could exhibit better catalytic performance through hybridization with nanocarbon substrates, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes. This is because those nanocarbons are conducive to improving the electrical conductivity, and simultaneously inhibit the corrosion of TMPs.28 Metal organic frameworks (MOFs), which are porous materials with abundant carbon and nitrogen ligands, and high metal ion contents, are considered as good templates/precursors to fabricate different types of TMP–carbon porous nanostructured hybrid materials.29,30 Up to now, most of the obtained MOF-derived TMPs maintain a three-dimensional (3D) topological structure. Compared with the 3D morphology, the ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets become more attractive, owing to its efficient charge and mass transport, and large surface-to-volume ratio.11,31–33 In addition, it has been demonstrated that the P-top site on the (011) facet could act as the centre for HER.34 Nevertheless, it is well accepted that the nanocatalysts with more high-index facet usually exhibit more reactive activity compared with those mainly occupied by the low-index plane.35 Therefore, fabricating a hybrid nanostructure between the high-index facet dominant TMP and nanocarbon is expected to reduce the overpotential of HER, while such work still remains a great challenge and has rarely been reported.36
Considering the above inspirations, we report a facile one-step phosphorization MOF-derived route to synthesize CoP nanoparticles embedded on an ultrathin carbon substrate (CoP@C). By varying the proportion of cobalt ions and 2-dimethylimidazole (2-MeIM) from 2:1 to 1:4, the obtained MOF changes from a 3D structure (ZIF-67) to 2D nanosheets, thus leading to the morphology variation of the obtained CoP@C after phosphorization. XRD patterns of the obtained CoP@C show that the peak intensity ratio between (211) and (011) is increased from 0.83 in the 3D morphology (CoP@C-4) to 1.39 in the 2D nanosheets (CoP@C-2), indicating that more (211) facets are exposed. The as-synthesized CoP@C-2 exhibits a lower overpotential and Tafel slope for HER with extraordinary long-term durability compared with CoP@C-4. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations indicate that the Gibbs free energy at the (211) plane is more appropriate than that at the (011) facet for H2 evolution in both alkaline and acidic media. Furthermore, CoP@C-2 shows a higher catalytic performance for OER than CoP@C-4, and a potential of 1.67 V is required to achieve 10 mA cm−2 current density when CoP@C-2 served as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting. This work may pave the way for the fabrication of highly effective non-noble metal phosphide-based bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials and chemicals
Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), 2-methylimidazole (C4H6N2), sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2) were bought from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. All reagents were used without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of Co-MOFs
First, Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.873 g, 3 mmol) was dissolved in 30 mL methanol solution to form the A solution, and 2-methylimidazole (2-MeIM, 0.1232 g, 1.5 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL methanol solution to form the B solution. Then, solution A was quickly poured into solution B under magnetic agitation for 5 min. The mixed solution was transformed into a water bath under the temperature of 35 °C for 24 hours. Finally, the precipitates (named as Co-MOF-1) were centrifuged, rinsed repeatedly with ethanol, and finally dried in vacuum at 60 °C. By this process, Co-MOF nanocomposites with different molar ratios between Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 2-MeIM were prepared and named as Co-MOF-X (X = 1, 2, 3 and 4 refers to the molar ratio of 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4, respectively).
2.3 Synthesis of CoP@C
The as-prepared Co-MOF powder (50 mg) and NaH2PO2 (1.0 g) was heated at 350 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in the tube furnace under nitrogen atmosphere. The phosphated powders were stirred in the 0.5 M H2SO4 solution (20 mL) for 6 h at room temperature to remove the impurities. Finally, the solid was centrifuged and washed with ethanol several times, and then dried in vacuum at 60 °C. By this process, different Co-MOFs were phosphated under a nitrogen atmosphere and named as CoP@C-Y (Y = 1, 2, 3 and 4 refers to the molar ratio of 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4 between Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 2-MeIM, respectively).
2.4 Materials characterization
Co-MOF-X and CoP@C-Y were characterized by XRD (X-ray diffraction, Rigaku Rint-2500, Cu Kα source) to determine their crystal structures. The morphologies and microstructures were conducted by SEM (scanning electron microscopy, ZEISS GeminiSEM Germany), TEM (transmission electron microscopy, JEOL JEM200CX, JEOL), and HRTEM (high-resolution TEM, Tecnai G2 F30). XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) was performed with a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer to investigate the surface chemical composition. The adventitious carbon (C 1s located at 284.8 eV) was used as a reference for the binding energy. Raman spectroscopic measurements were recorded on a Renishaw apparatus via 532 nm excitation wavelength. FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectrometer) spectroscopy was carried out with a Bruker Verte 70.
2.5 Electrochemical measurements
A CHI-760D electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Chenhua, Shanghai, People's Republic of China) with a three-electrode system at room temperature was used to conduct the electrochemical properties of all samples. To make the work electrode (glassy-carbon electrode, with 3 mm in diameter), 4 mg electrocatalyst was dispersed in a solution with the volume ratio of 4:1 between water and ethanol. Then, 0.02 mL 5 wt% Nafion was added to the solution. After 30 min sonication, 5 μL of the ink was drop-casted onto the surface of a glassy-carbon electrode and dried in air. The loading amount of the catalysts is about 0.2829 mg cm−2. The platinum electrode was used as the counter electrode, and Hg/HgO in alkaline and Ag/AgCl in acidic were used as the reference electrode, respectively. For the overall water splitting, CoP@C-2 was deposited on the Ni foam to act as both anode and cathode with the amount of 1.5 mg cm−2. The mass of the active materials was simply calculated by the mass of the samples minus the mass of the bare Ni foam.
The system is relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential conversion formula: E(vs. RHE) = E(Hg/HgO) + 0.098 + 0.0591 × pH in alkaline media, E(vs. RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 + 0.0591 × pH. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were recorded in all pH-universal at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The slope of the Tafel curve in this experiment was obtained by fitting the polarization curve. The fitting equation is as follows: η = a + b·log|j|, where η is the overpotential, b is the Tafel slope, and j is the current density. Through selecting the corresponding linear area followed by linear fitting, the corresponding parameters could be obtained. Electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) measurements were investigated by CV curve at different scanning speeds. The relationship between the positive and negative scanning difference of the current density and scanning speed corresponding to the intermediate potential was plotted. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out by applying an amplitude of 5 mV for in the frequency range of 0.01 to 105 Hz. The faradaic efficiency (FE) for the HER was tested at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 by drainage method. The turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated as follows (see the ESI† for details).37  
2.6 DFT calculations
All density functional theory (DFT) calculations in the present paper have been carried out by employing the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). Structural optimization and energy calculation were performed using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange–correlation functional, which can be used to describe the electronic exchange and correlation effects. The energy cutoffs for the selection of the plane waves for the description of the wave function were set to 450 eV. Convergence criteria for the ionic relaxation and the electronic self-consistency were set at 5 × 10−2 and 1 × 10−5, respectively. DFT-D3 method was adopted for the Van der Waals correction. The k-point sampling of the Brillouin zone was done using a 5 × 5 × 1 for all calculation models. The CoP (011) and CoP (211) slabs were separated by a vacuum region (20 Å in the z direction).
The computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model used here to calculate the Gibbs reaction free energy of the HER electrochemical elementary steps was proposed by Nørskov and co-workers.38–40 The chemical potential of the proton–electron (H+/e−) pair is equal to that of half of a hydrogen molecule at standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) conditions. In an alkaline electrolyte, the key reaction steps of the HER can be written as: H2O + e– + * → H* + –OH(1) H* + H* → H2(g) + 2*(2)
In an acid electrolyte, H+ can act as the proton donor, so the overall reaction scheme of the HER can be written as: (3)where the * represents the adsorption site. The change of the Gibbs free energy for the adsorbed species was calculated, and is defined as follows: ΔG = ΔEDFT + ΔEZPE − TΔS + ΔGU + ΔGpH(4)where ΔEDFT is the product molecules adsorbed on the catalyst surface and the reaction energy obtained from DFT calculations. ΔEZPE and ΔS are the zero-point energy change and entropy change, respectively. The bias effect on the free energy was also taken into account by shifting the energy of the state by ΔGU = −neU, where U is the electrode applied potential relative to RHE; n is the number of proton–electron pairs transferred. The correction of the H+ free energy was calculated by ΔGpH = −kBTln[H+], where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.
3 Results and discussion
The preparation processes and structural schemes of CoP@C-Y are illustrated in Fig. 1a (see details in the Experimental section). Co-MOFs are first synthesized by simply mixing Co2+ ions and 2-dimethylimidazole (2-MeIM) solutions in a water bath, and four samples with different proportions of Co2+ and 2-MeIM are obtained. Interestingly, the colour of the as-synthesized Co-MOFs was greatly changed by decreasing the amount of 2-MeIM (Fig. 1b). For the molar ratio of Co2+ and 2-MeIM with 1:2 and 1:4 (corresponding to Co-MOF-3 and Co-MOF-4, respectively), the Co-MOFs exhibited a dark purple colour, which is consistent with the reported ZIF-67.41,42 In contrast, it turns to be pale yellow when the ratio is 2:1 and 1:1 (Co-MOF-1 and Co-MOF-2, respectively). In addition to the colour variation, the weight of the obtained Co-MOFs is different, which gradually decreases from Co-MOF-4 to Co-MOF-1. We suppose that such morphology and weight change of Co-MOFs have a strong relationship with the coordination between Co2+ and 2-MeIM, influenced by the amount of 2-MeIM.43 Then, the different Co-MOFs are phosphated under a nitrogen atmosphere at 350 °C for 2 h to synthesize CoP@C-Y, and all of the obtained electrocatalysts show a black colour (Fig. S15†).

The morphologies of Co-MOF-X and CoP@C-Y were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 2). Co-MOF-3 and Co-MOF-4 exhibit a well-defined rhombic dodecahedron structure with smooth surfaces and uniform size distributions of about 300 nm. It changes to a microflower-like structure that consists of a large quantity of ultrathin nanosheets for Co-MOF-2, and the morphology has no variation upon further decreasing the amount of 2-MeIM (Fig. 2a and c and S2†). We suppose that the morphology variation is caused by the insufficient organic ligand, leading to the collapse of the 3D structure of the dodecahedron, and such phenomenon has also been reported in previous work.31 After the phosphorization process, all four CoP@C-Y samples maintain the morphology and size as their MOF precursors without any damage except that the smooth surface become rough (Fig. 2b and d and S2†). The TEM image of CoP@C-2 clearly demonstrates that the roughened surface is caused by small CoP nanoparticles, which are embedded on the carbon substrate (Fig. 2e). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image exhibits the lattice spacing of 0.279 and 0.186 nm, corresponding to the (001) and (211) facet, respectively (Fig. 2f).12 The thickness of CoP@C-2 was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As displayed in Fig. S3,† CoP@C-2 possesses a uniform topographic height of approximately 25 nm, indicating the typical 2D nanosheet structure. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping is shown in Fig. 2g. The results indicate that the elements of Co, P, and C were uniformly spread over the nanosheets, suggesting the successfully formation of CoP@C hybridization. Moreover, the Raman spectra of CoP@C-2 and CoP@C-4 were conducted. Two characteristic signals at 1350 and 1580 cm−1 could be observed in CoP@C-4, and were assigned to the D band and G band, respectively (Fig. S4†). In contrast, the peaks in CoP@C-2 are difficult to find, which may be due to the relatively low amount of 2-MeIM in its MOF precursor and low temperature during calcination.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared Co-MOF-X and corresponding CoP@C-Y were characterized to identify their crystal structures. As shown in Fig. 3a, the peaks of Co-MOF-4 exhibit the formation of ZIF-67 (a = b = c = 16.9589 Å) with good crystallinity.32,44,45 In contrast, the XRD pattern of Co-MOF-2 is quite different from that of Co-MOF-4, which is probably caused by the morphology variation observed in the SEM images. Additionally, the XRD peaks of Co-MOF-2 cannot be indexed to Co(OH)2 either. In order to further prove that Co-MOF-2 is made by Co2+ coordinating with 2-MeIM rather than Co(OH)2, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of Co-MOF-2 and Co-MOF-4 were recorded (Fig. S5†). The characteristic peaks at 1660, 2920, and 3455 cm−1 are ascribed to –CC, –C–H and –N–H, respectively, indicating the existence of 2-MeIM in Co-MOF-2 and Co-MOF-4.46,47 In addition, the higher peak intensity in Co-MOF-4 is due to the larger molar ratio of Co2+ and 2-MeIM. After the phosphorization process, both Co-MOF-2 and Co-MOF-4 turned to be orthorhombic CoP (JCPDS card No. 29-0497) (Fig. 3b). For CoP@C-4, the diffraction peak with the highest intensity is located at 31.6°, which is ascribed to the (011) facet. However, the peak at 48.1° indexing to the (211) plane becomes the strongest after forming nanosheets (CoP@C-2).48 Importantly, the peak intensity ratio between the (211) and (011) facets increases by 1.67 times from 0.83 in CoP@C-4 to 1.39 in CoP@C-2 (Table S1†). Even though the peak at 46.2° corresponding to (112) facet also shows an increased intensity after forming a 2D structure (peak intensity ratio between the (112) and (001) facets was calculated to be 0.36 in CoP@C-4 and 0.42 in CoP@C-2, as shown in Table S2†), the enhancement is not as high as that for the (211) facet. Therefore, we suppose that the (211) facet would be the dominant and more exposed facet in CoP@C-2. Due to the higher intensity of the (211) facet than that of the (011) facet, we suppose that the crystal plane (211) would be more beneficial for the electrocatalytic HER reaction, leading to an enhanced catalytic activity.

The chemical composition and valence state of CoP@C-2 and CoP@C-4 were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. S6† displays the XPS survey spectra of CoP@C, which confirms the existence of Co, P, C, and N in the samples. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p shown in Fig. 3c display six peaks, and no peak shift could be observed in both CoP@C-2 and CoP@C-4. The binding energies (BEs) of Co 2p3/2 can be deconvoluted into three peaks. The peaks at 784.8, 781.1 and 778.6 eV could be assigned to the satellite peak, oxidized Co species and Co–P in CoP, respectively.28 The assignment of the Co 2p1/2 peaks resemble those of Co 2p3/2. The BEs of the P 2p peaks centered at 129.1 and 129.9 eV correspond to P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 3d). The peak at 133.1 eV is ascribed to the P–O bond caused by the partial oxidization of the P species.49,50 Due to the BEs of the metal Co 2p3/2 and elemental P 2p3/2 being located at 778.1 and 130.2 eV,51 respectively, the peak shift of Co 2p3/2 and P 2p3/2 in CoP@C indicate a charge transfer from Co to P.52 The high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s is deconvoluted into three peaks as C–C (284.8 eV), C–O (286.1 eV) and C–N (286.8 eV), respectively (Fig. 3e).53 The N 1s spectra exhibit three types, located at 398.8, 400.1, and 401.5 eV, which can be ascribed to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and graphitic N, respectively (Fig. 3f). The existence of the pyrrolic N and pyridinic N species in the CoP@C catalyst could also improve the electrocatalytic activity for HER.54 Such XPS results further demonstrate that the CoP and nanocarbon compositions were successfully synthesized.
The electrocatalytic HER performances of these Co-based catalysts were first evaluated in a three-electrode system in alkaline media (1 M KOH), and commercial 20% Pt/C was used for comparison. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve measurements of all samples were carried out with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 (Fig. 4a). Pt/C exhibits the highest HER activity, which only needs 2 mV and 51 mV to reach the current density of 1 mA cm−2 (which is denoted as the onset overpotential) and 10 mA cm−2, respectively. As expected, the 2D structure (CoP@C-2) with the onset overpotential of 59 mV and 127 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for HER, shows a much lower overpotential than CoP@C with 3D morphology (CoP@C-4) (152 and 217 mV). The current CoP@C-2 catalyst is among the lowest reported values on transition-metal phosphide HER electrocatalysts (Table S3†). Due to the comparable structure, the LSV curves of CoP@C-1 and CoP@C-3 almost overlap with those of CoP@C-2 and CoP@C-4, respectively, indicating a similar catalytic activity. The slope of the Tafel curve was obtained by fitting the polarization curve.55 As observed in Fig. 4b, Pt/C shows the smallest Tafel slope of about 62 mV dec−1, which is in accordance with the previous result.56 In addition, CoP@C-2 possesses a lower Tafel slope of 78 mV dec−1 compared with that of CoP@C-4 (87 mV dec−1), suggesting that the HER on CoP@C probably follows the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism.57

To further understand the inherent activity of CoP@C-Y, electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) measurements were conducted by CV curves at different scanning speeds from 20 to 260 mV s−1 around the open circuit potential (Fig. S7†).8,58 The double-layer capacitance was estimated by plotting the ΔJ(Ja-Jc) at 0.15 V as a function of scan rate, as illustrated in Fig. 4c. Then, the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) can be calculated via the slope from the linear fitting, which served as an efficient parameter to determine the amount of active HER sites for the sample with good conductivity.59 It was found that the Cdl of CoP@C-2 (7.03 mF cm−2) is 6.5 times higher than that of CoP@C-4 (1.08 mF cm−2), which is responsible for the enhanced electrocatalytic HER activity of CoP@C-2. We believe that the larger ECSA of CoP@C-2 is attributed to the advantages of the 2D nanosheet structure.60 In addition, the Nyquist plots of CoP@C-2 catalyst show a smaller transfer resistance than that of CoP@C-4, indicating the better HER kinetics (Fig. 4d).56,61 The faradaic efficiency (FE) for HER was tested by drainage method.62,63 As shown in Fig. S8,† the acquisition of 4.4 mL H2 was collected after about 3640 s (H2 generation rate approached 177 μmol L−1), and the FE of H2 was almost 95.18%. The turnover frequency (TOF) was also utilized to describe the intrinsic activity of the catalysts.37,64 As illustrated in Fig. S9,† the TOF value of CoP@C-2 and CoP@C-4 at an overpotential of 150, 200 and 250 mV were calculated, respectively, in which CoP@C-2 (0.4682 s−1) exhibits a 6.1-fold increased TOF compared with that of E-mail: CoP@C-4 (0.0764 s−1) at 200 mV. This result confirms that the 2D nanosheet structure could enhance the intrinsic HER activity. The durability of CoP@C-2 was further evaluated by CV scanning 1000 cycles and chronopotentiometry testing. As shown in Fig. 4e, the overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 shows a relatively weak decay (from 127 to 132 mV). The long-term chronopotentiometry curve also showed that the catalytic activities of CoP@C-2 could be maintained for at least 24 h in 1 M KOH (Fig. 4f). In addition, the current density of CoP@C-2 was kept at about 10 mA cm−2 during the continuous hydrogen-release for 24 h (Fig. S10†). The morphologies of CoP@C-2 after HER stability testing are characterized by TEM. As shown in Fig. S11,† CoP@C-2 maintained a two-dimensional structure with a little agglomeration. The elemental mappings show that the Co and P elements are homogeneously dispersed, indicating the good stability of the catalyst. In addition, the chemical state of CoP@C-2 after stability testing was investigated by XPS. The spectra of Co 2p and P 2p exhibit similar binding energies before and after 1000 cycles, further suggesting the good stability of CoP@C-2 (Fig. S12†). Moreover, the catalytic performances of CoP@C were conducted in 0.5 M H2SO4. The LSV curves of CoP@C-2 exhibited a smaller overpotential of 236 for HER than CoP@C-4 (286 mV) to achieve 10 mA cm−2 and some other non-noble-metal electrocatalysts in acid media (Table S4†). The corresponding Tafel slopes of CoP@C-2 (78 mV dec−1) were also smaller than that of CoP@C-4 (99 mV dec−1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 (Fig. S13†).
To gain atomistic insights about the nature of the active CoP@C-2, density functional theory (DFT) simulations were performed. According to the results of the XRD patterns, the peak intensity ratio between the (211) and (011) facet was greatly increased in CoP@C-2 compared to that in CoP@C-4. Thus, the facets of the orthorhombic CoP including (011) and (211) were constructed to investigate their HER performance (Fig. 5a and b). According to the calculations, the P-top site in the CoP (011) and (211) facet was confirmed to be the main active sites for H2O dissociation and H2 formation (Fig. S14 and S15 and Table S5†). In alkaline media, the HER elementary steps include: i) the absorbed H2O dissociation to give H* and OH− (the Volmer step), and ii) the H2 is produced by two adsorbed H* (the Tafel or Heyrovsky step). As shown in Fig. 5c, the ΔGH2O values on the CoP (011) and (211) facets are 0.75 and −0.45 eV, respectively. This result indicates that H2O dissociation on the CoP (211) facet is more thermodynamics favorable than that on the CoP (011) facet. In other words, the CoP (211) facet can effectively promote the cleavage of the H–OH bonds to produce H* intermediates. In the next H2 production step, the thermodynamics barriers are 0.17 and 0.05 eV on the CoP (011) and (211) facets, respectively. The previous results demonstrate that the HER activity of the electrocatalysts was determined by the free energy differences of the initial water dissociation step (ΔGH2O), and the final adsorption and desorption of H* intermediate step (ΔGH*).65 Therefore, the CoP (211) facet is more active for HER under alkaline condition than the (011) facet based on the lower ΔGH2O and ΔGH*. In acid solution, the HER process can be described as a three-state diagram, including H+ + e− as the initial state, H* as the intermediate state and 1/2 H2 as the final state.34,66 As displayed in Fig. 5d, the ΔGH* values on the (011) and (211) facets are −0.17 and −0.05 eV, respectively. Hence, the CoP (211) facet is also more active than the CoP (011) facet in acid media. This is because the closer the ΔGH* value approaches zero, the higher the catalytic HER activity.67–69

(d) The free energy diagram for HER of CoP@C (211) and (011) in the P-top site under the acid condition. 
In addition, the OER catalytic performances of the CoP@C-Y electrocatalysts were assessed in 1 M KOH solution. The LSV curves of all samples with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 6a. An overpotential of 310 mV versus RHE is required for CoP@C-2 to achieve 10 mA cm−2 current density, which is much lower than that for CoP@C-4 (380 mV). The corresponding Tafel slopes also demonstrated a smaller Tafel value (86 mV dec−1) for CoP@C-2 in contrast that for CoP@C-4 (121 mV dec−1), suggesting superior catalytic behavior for OER and higher OER rates of CoP@C-2 (Fig. 6b). The above results indicate that the excellent electrocatalytic performances of CoP@C-2 could serve as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. Therefore, a two-electrode configuration was conducted by using CoP@C-2 as both the cathode for HER and anode for OER in 1 M KOH, which exhibits the overall water splitting performance with a cell voltage of 1.67 V to achieve 10 mA cm−2 current density (Fig. 6c). The cathode and anode show the appearance of large numbers of H2 and O2 bubbles during electrolysis, respectively (Video S1†). Such overall water splitting activity of CoP@C-2 is superior to that of most of the reported non-noble-metal electrocatalysts (Table S6†). The stability of the CoP@C-2 was also tested by chronoamperometry at a cell voltage of 1.67 V in 1 M KOH. The current density could mostly be retained after the 50 h test, confirming the excellent stability of the CoP@C-2 for overall water splitting (Fig. 6d).

4 Conclusions
In summary, the CoP@C electrocatalysts with 2D and 3D structures derived from Co-MOFs were synthesized through the one-step low temperature phosphorization strategy. CoP@C-2 displayed increased a peak intensity ratio between the (211) and (011) facets compared with CoP@C-4, indicating more exposed (211) facet. DFT simulations reveal that the (211) plane is more active for HER in both alkaline and acid media. Additionally, CoP@C-2 showed a 6.5-times increased ECSA and a lower charge transfer resistance in contrast with CoP@C-4 because of the unique 2D morphology. As a result, the HER electrocatalytic performances of CoP@C-2 is significantly enhanced than that of CoP@C-4. Overpotentials of 127 and 236 mV for the HER in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 media were required for CoP@C-2 to reach 10 mA cm−2 current density, respectively. Moreover, the CoP@C-2 catalyst showed OER activity in 1 M KOH with the overpotential of 310 mV compared with that of CoP@C-4 (380 mV). When the CoP@C-2 electrocatalyst was performed as a two-electrode cell for overall water splitting, the required cell potential was 1.67 V to achieve 10 mA cm−2 and the catalyst maintained excellent stability after long-term duration. The current work will be beneficial to the design of a non-noble metal catalyst for enhancing the HER performance with high efficiency and long-term stability.
