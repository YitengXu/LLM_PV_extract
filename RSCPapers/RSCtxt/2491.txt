    , Accepted 26th March 2019First published on 27th March 2019AbstractFour anthracene-based dyes (ANDs) with different donor groups, namely 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (A1), 9,10-bis((9-dodecyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)ethynyl) anthracene (A2), 9,10-bis((10-dodecyl-10H-phenothiazin-3-yl)ethynyl)anthracene (A3), and 4,4′-(anthracene-9,10-diylbis(ethyne-2,1-diyl))bis(N,N-diphenylaniline) (A4) were synthesized and characterized. The ANDs showed considerable absorption in blue/green regions and strong fluorescence emission in the green to red region. Besides, the ANDs possess large two-photon absorption cross-sections at 780–880 nm. Electrochemical studies revealed that these electron donors possess different donating abilities which in turn influence the redox potential and excited intramolecular charge transfer intensity of the ANDs. The conjugation degree among the donor groups and anthracene also has a significant impact on the redox potential of the ANDs. Moreover, compounds A1, A2, and A3 are able to couple with iodonium salt to initiate radical photopolymerization under blue and green LED irradiation. In summary, the structure–property relationships were investigated in detail in this work, which may provide useful guidance for further research.
1. Introduction
Anthracene has a large planar structure and good photophysical properties. Thus, anthracene is extensively adopted in many functional molecules which are applied in dye-sensitized solar cells,1 OLED materials,2 fluorescent sensors,3 and bioimaging.4
Anthracene also gained attention in photosensitive polymerization.5–7 Photopolymerization is an advanced technology used to prepare many functional polymeric materials using different monomers via temporal- and spatial-controlled methods.8,9 The development of a highly efficient photoinitiation system under soft irradiation has attracted great interest in this field.10 Dye-sensitized photopolymerization, typically involving dyes and iodonium salt, emerged as a practical method to fulfill the current needs in visible light-induced polymerization.11 The sensitization mechanism generally involved a photoinduced electron transfer from dyes to iodonium salt.
Crivello reported that anthracene derivatives are good photosensitizers for iodonium and sulfonium salts to initiate efficient cationic photopolymerization.12,13 The simple substitution on anthracene could improve the sensitizing efficiency but shows little contribution to the redshift of the absorption spectra.13 Lalevée and co-workers proposed a novel anthracene-based sensitizer, whose absorption spectrum extends to the visible range with a high molar extinction efficiency.14 They also designed a novel organic photocatalyst based on anthracene scaffolds, which shows good polymerization profiles when combined with diphenyl iodonium salt and silane.15 Carbazole (CZ), phenothiazine (PTZ), and triphenylamine (TPE) are common aryl amines and were frequently used as electron donor groups.16–18 Research shows that the introduction of such aryl amines could improve the sensitizing ability of dyes.19–21 However, the effects of substitution with these specific donors on the anthracene core are still rarely reported.
Compounds based on the anthracene skeleton show great potential as novel and efficient photosensitizers. Although many anthracene-based compounds have emerged, little work was dedicated to study their photopolymerization sensitization effect. Herein, we designed and synthesized four dyes (ANDs) with anthracene as the electron acceptor and phenyl, CZ, PTZ, and TPE as electron donor groups. The triple bond linkage was selected to ensure the good conjugation among acceptors and donors.22 The ANDs were employed to sensitize the iodonium salt to initiate radical polymerization under blue and green LED irradiation.
In addition, the one- and two-photon absorption, fluorescence emission, and electrochemical properties of ANDs were thoughtfully investigated by using various experiments. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory calculations were carried out to get a deep insight into these dyes.23
2. Experimental details

All reagents and solvents used were of reagent grade, obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was purchased from Beijing Chemical Works (Beijing, China). Iodonium bis(4-methylphenyl) hexafluorophosphate was used as a reference iodonium salt (ONI). Hexanediol diacrylate (HDDA, purchased from Guangzhou Lihou Trading Co. Ltd, China) was chosen as the monomer for free radical photopolymerization. Phenylacetylene (Ph-C) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Beijing, China). Anthracene (AN) and triphenylamine (TPE) were purchased from Alfachem (Zhengzhou, China). 9-Dodecyl-9H-carbazole (CZ), 10-dodecyl-10H-phenothiazine (PTZ), 9,10-dibromoanthracene (DBrAN), 4-ethynyl-N,N-diphenylaniline (TPE-C), 9-dodecyl-3-ethynyl-9H-carbazole (CZ-C), and 10-dodecyl-3-ethynyl-10H-phenothiazine (PTZ-C) were prepared according to literature procedures.21,24 They were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Scheme 1 shows the abbreviations and structures of the selected compounds in this study.

1H NMR (400 MHz) and 13C NMR (101 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV400 NMR spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 5700 instrument (Thermo Electron corporation, Waltham, MA). MS measurements were carried out using an LC/MSD mass spectrometer. The melting points were determined using an XT-4 microscopy melting point apparatus. The UV-vis spectra were recorded using a UV-5200 (UNICO) UV-vis spectrophotometer. The fluorescence properties were studied using an F-4500 (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation) fluorescence spectrophotometer. Two-photon excited fluorescence spectra were recorded using an SD2000 spectrometer (Ocean Optical) with excitation by a femtosecond laser (Tsunami, Spectra-Physics).
Chip on board (COB) light sources were used for the irradiation of the photocurable samples: violet LEDs (JH-100V14G30-Z1C, 385 nm), blue LEDs (JH-100B14G30-Z1C, 460 nm) and green LEDs (JH-100G14G30- Z1C, 520 nm). The power of the COB light sources is adjustable with a maximum of 100 W.

2.3. Computational procedure
Theoretical studies were conducted using the Gaussian 09 package. The calculations were performed at the M06-2X/6-31G(d,p), (CPCM, THF) level of theory.25 Frequency analysis was performed under the same conditions to ensure the energy minimum. The electronic vertical transition energy was calculated by the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) method. The triplet energy of ANDs was calculated according to the literature.26 The frontier molecular orbitals were analysed and visualized using GaussView 5.0 software. To save the calculation time, the resolutive alkyl chain was replaced by methyl.27
2.4. Fluorescence quantum yield experiment
The fluorescence quantum yields of ANDs were obtained by eqn (1) using quinine sulfate dihydrate (1.0 × 10−6 M in 0.1 M sulfuric acid aqueous solution) as a reference (Φref = 0.54).28 The dye concentration is 1.0 × 10−6 M in THF solution: (1)where Φ is the quantum yield, n is the refractive index, A is the absorbance of the solution at the excitation wavelength, and F is the integrated area of the emission spectrum. The reported quantum yield values are the average of three measurements.
2.5. Two-photon excitation fluorescence experiment
Two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) spectra were recorded on an SD2000 spectrometer with a femtosecond laser (Tsunami, Spectra-Physics). This laser provides pulses of 100 fs duration at a repetition rate of 80 MHz and is tunable in the wavelength range of 780–880 nm. The laser beam was focused on a quartz cell of 1 cm path length using a 5 cm focal length. The excitation intensity is 8.2 GW cm−2 and the laser spot diameter is 2 mm. To calculate the TPA cross-sections (TPACS), Rhodamine B in a methanol solution (1.0 × 10−6 M) was utilized as a reference (Φref = 0.71).29 The solutions of ANDs (1.0 × 10−6 M) were prepared in THF solvent. All the samples and reference were tested under the same experimental conditions. The TPACS(δTPA) was then calculated using eqn (2): (2)where Φ is the fluorescence quantum yield of the sample as stated in eqn (1), c is the concentration of the solution, n is the refractive index of the solvent, δref is the TPACS value of the reference molecule, and F is the integral of the TPEF spectrum. The uncertainty of the TPEF technique in δ is 15%.29–31
2.6. Cyclic voltammetry experiment
The redox potential of the ANDs was measured in dichloromethane (DCM) by cyclic voltammetry (CHI660E electrochemical workstation) with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte. Glassy carbon, the Ag/AgNO3 electrode and a platinum wire were used as the working, reference, and auxiliary electrodes, respectively. The ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) couple was used as an outer standard.32 The free energy change ΔGS (ΔGT) for the electron transfer between the excited ANDs and ONI was calculated using the classical Rehm–Weller equation (eqn (3)): ΔGS (GT) = E1/2 − Ered − ES(ET) − C(3)where E1/2, Ered, ES (or ET), and C are the half-wave potential of the electron donor, the reduction potential of the electron acceptor, the excited singlet (or triplet) state energy of the ANDs, and the electrostatic interaction energy for the initially formed ion pair (this latter parameter is considered negligible in polar solvents), respectively.
2.7. Photopolymerization experiment
The free radical photopolymerization of HDDA was carried out under laminated conditions. The photosensitive formulations were photocured in 0.5 mm thick plastic molds with a 5 mm diameter center. The molds were clamped between two glass slides. The power of the violet/blue/green LEDs was set to 30 W. The distance between irradiation sources and formulations is 5 cm. The specimens were irradiated at different time intervals by controlling the curing light. The near-infrared spectra of the uncured resin were collected by using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Nicolet 5700, 4000–7000 cm−1 wavelength range); the spectra were obtained immediately after each exposure interval. The double bond conversion profiles were calculated from the decay of the absorption intensities located at 6165 cm−1. The double bond conversion was calculated using the following equation (eqn (4)): Conversion % = [1 − (St/S0)] × 100%(4)where St is the area of the CC characteristic absorbance peak and S0 is the initial area of the CC characteristic absorbance peak.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. One-photon properties

3.1.1. UV-vis absorption. 
The absorption spectra of anthracene-based dyes (ANDs) in THF solution are shown in Fig. 1. As expected, the absorption bands with considerable molar extinction coefficients were found in the visible light regions, which make ANDs applicable in blue/green LED sources. Their maximum absorption wavelength, corresponding extinction coefficients and partial transition information obtained from the TDDFT calculation are listed in Table 1. The detailed transition data (fos > 0.1) are provided in Table S1 (ESI†). The involved molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†).

As shown in Table 1, the theoretical maximum absorption wavelengths are very close to the experimental values. A full comparison of the experimental UV-vis spectra and theoretical vertical transition energy is shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). This fact illustrates that the excitation behaviours of the ANDs were properly simulated under the current method and level of theory. The probability of transition of a ground state molecule to an excited state is proportional to the transition dipole moment. Therefore, their different absorption abilities at the maximum absorption wavelength (A4 > A2 > A3 ≈ A1) could be explained by their different transition electric dipole moments of the ground state to the first excited states (μge) as well as the disparate oscillator strength. In addition, it is worth mentioning that a similar trend was also observed in our previous studies wherein these electron donor groups were linked to different acceptors.19,21 This finding is valuable to predict the light absorption ability of molecules containing these donor groups.
As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the π–π* transitions of different parts in ANDs are responsible for the three bands observed in Fig. 1. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the ANDs are shown in Fig. 2. The HOMO–LUMO transitions show an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) feature aside from the typical π–π* transition behaviour. The HOMOs are evenly delocalized on the whole molecule, whereas the LUMOs are mostly concentrated on the anthracene core. This ICT phenomenon indicates that the ANDs could be assigned to the D–π–A–π–D structure. Hence, the ICT properties also contribute to the band at 400–550 nm resulting from the π–π* transition.

3.1.2. Fluorescence emission. 
The normalized experimental fluorescence spectra of the ANDs in THF solution are shown in Fig. 3, wherein the maximum emission wavelength ranges from 474–638 nm. The detailed data are listed in Table 2. To investigate the ICT characteristic of the ANDs, the absorption spectra and emission spectra in different solvents with varied polarities were investigated and are shown in Fig. S11 and S12, and the corresponding data are listed in Table S2 (ESI†).

As shown in Table 2, A1 and A2 show a relatively small Stokes shift, which may be due to their rigid structure (Fig. S13, ESI†). A3 exhibits red emission in THF solution and its Stokes shift (144 nm) is the largest one. The effect was also found in other red-light emitting compounds containing the PTZ moiety.33 The butterfly structure of PTZ which may undergo planarization in excited states is proposed to be partially answerable for its large Stokes shift.26 This strong non-radiative process of PTZ is also in line with the low quantum yield of A3.
We discussed above that the ANDs possess an ICT transition feature. Therefore, the ICT intensity of the ANDs would be undoubtedly influenced by their corresponding donor groups. In this work, the electron releasing ability of these donors was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry experiments. Based on their first oxidative peak potentials (see Fig. 5(b)–(d) and Table S4, ESI†), their electron donating ability was assessed as PTZ > TPE > CZ > Ph. The strongest donating ability of PTZ may result from its electron-rich nitrogen and sulphur atoms. The absorption spectra of the ANDs display faint solvent effects, denoting the weak interaction between the ground state of the ANDs and the solvent. By contrast, the degree of the red shift of the emission spectra of the ANDs in different solvents is positively related with the electron donating ability of donor groups. As shown in Fig. S12 and Table S2 (ESI†), the maximum emission wavelength of A3 is 559 nm and 671 nm in toluene and DCM, respectively. Moreover, DMF totally quenched the emission of A3. These remarkable interactions between A3 and the solvent prove that A3 has the strongest excited state ICT intensity,34 which is in line with the strongest electron donating ability of PTZ. These phenomena indicate that the excited ICT intensity of the ANDs depends on the donating ability of the donor group, namely the stronger donor leads to a stronger ICT behaviour.

3.2. Two-photon absorption properties
Molecules possessing two-photon absorption (TPA) properties have wide applications. As previously studied, anthracene-based polymers and molecules exhibit good TPA properties.30,31,35,36 To expand the application of the ANDs in the TPA field, the TPACS of the ANDs were measured by the two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) technique at excitation wavelengths ranging from 780 nm to 880 nm.
As shown in Fig. 1, all the target dyes are highly transparent, without any absorption in the wavelength range of 780–880 nm. It has been known that the two-photon transition probability is quadratically dependent on the excitation laser intensity.31 As an example, the intensity dependence of the TPEF signal of A2 was tested at an excitation wavelength of 820 nm to exclude other photochemical or photophysical effects. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the TPEF intensity of A2 was strengthened with the increasing incident laser power. The logarithmic plot of the TPEF intensity with the incident laser power yielded a slope of 1.763 (R2 = 0.999, Fig. 4(a) inset). The nearly quadratic dependence of the fluorescence intensity on the excitation laser intensity confirmed the two-photon process.

The corresponding TPACS of the ANDs in THF solution at these specific wavelengths were calculated using eqn (2) and are shown in Fig. 4(b). In the 780–880 nm regions, the maximum TPACS are 644 GM at 780 nm for A2 and 90, 616, and 1263 GM for A1, A3, and A4 at 820 nm, respectively. The detailed data at each wavelength are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). Compared with A1, the strong donating ability of these aryl amine donors is responsible for their highly enhanced TPACS values. Given that A2/A3/A4 contains the structure of A1, the larger conjugated planar structure of these molecules may also contribute to the enhanced TPACS. The maximum TPACS of the ANDs concentrate at around 820 nm, which makes these dyes suitable for the most commonly used wavelength in two-photon induced photopolymerization.37
3.3. Electrochemical studies
Electrochemical properties are important to evaluate the feasibility of photo-induced electron transfer reactions and the redox reversibility of metal or metal-free photocatalysts. For comparison, cyclic voltammetry experiments were also conducted on anthracene and different donors. Benzene was not used due to its high volatility. The E1/2 value is taken as the half-wave point between the forward and reverse peaks for the first reversible redox process. All potentials were transformed to the standard redox potential (vs. SCE). The cyclic voltammograms (CV) are shown in Fig. 5, and the corresponding electrochemical data are provided in Table 3 and Table S4 (ESI†).

As shown in Fig. 5, anthracene exhibits one redox peak while the ANDs present two redox peaks. This fact proves that the ANDs could undergo multiple redox processes. As expected, the first oxidative peaks (Epa1) of the ANDs exhibit an obvious cathodic shift compared with that of anthracene due to the introduction of highly electron releasing groups. The first Epa1 was envisioned to reflect the electron donating ability of ANDs which in turn should depend on the donating ability of these donors. The Ep1 of A3 and PTZ, and A4 and TPE are rather similar (Fig. 5(c) and (d)). By contrast, the Ep1 of A2 shows a large shift compared with that of CZ (Fig. 5(b), CZ → A2: 1.2 → 0.74), which may due to the best coplanar effect among anthracene and CZ. This finding demonstrates that the good intermolecular conjugation is likely to facilitate the occurrence of the oxidation process.
In contrast to anthracene and these donors, ANDs show uniform reversible cathodic peaks at around −1.45 V, which were also found in other D–π–A–π–D structures.38,39 The potential of these reversible cathodic peaks is almost identical, which further confirms that these peaks resulted from the acceptor, anthracene.
Except for the redox potential, the electrochemical reversibility of anthracene was also successfully mediated. Anthracene shows the highest ipa but negligible ipc, which points out its inferior redox reversibility. In comparison, the ANDs display unambiguous ipa and ipc. This fact highlights the relatively good reversibility of ANDs, which partially associates with the good reversibility of these donors.
The Eonsetox and Eonsetred of the ANDs were obtained according to the literature method (Fig. S14, ESI†) and were employed to calculate the experimental HOMO and LUMO energies.40 The results are listed in Table 3. The calculated electrochemical HOMO–LUMO band gap shows the same trend as the optical gap displayed in Fig. 1 and Table 1, which further attests that the maximum absorption of the ANDs originates from the HOMO–LUMO transitions.
3.4. Photopolymerization sensitizing effect

3.4.1. Free radical photopolymerization (FRP). 
The FRP of HDDA (100 wt%) in the presence of ONI (2 wt%) and ANDs (0.2 wt%) was carried out under blue and green LED irradiation, for which the ANDs exhibit certain absorption in these regions (Table 4). A small amount of THF was added as the solvent. The double bond conversion rate versus time curves of the photosensitive resin films containing different ANDs were obtained, which are shown in Fig. 6. The commercial CQ/TEA initiating system was tested under the same conditions for comparison. The A4/ONI system was not tested due to its inferior solubility in HDDA. For conciseness, the ANDs indicate A1, A2 and A3 in this section.

 Fig. 6  Photopolymerization profiles of HDDA in the presence of ANDs/ONI (ONI: 2.0 wt%; ANDs: 0.2 wt%) and CQ/TEA (TEA: 2.0 wt%; CQ: 0.2 wt%). (a) Under blue LED; (b) under green LED. 
The photopolymerization result (Fig. 6(a)) shows that the ANDs/ONI system has a better initiating efficiency than the CQ/TEA system under blue light. At 10 s irradiation time, the double conversion can reach 64%, 71%, 64%, and 47% for A1/ONI, A2/ONI, A3/ONI, and CQ/TEA, respectively. The initiating efficiency for ANDs/ONI systems is very similar, and the final conversion (FC) can reach 84% at 50 s irradiation time. Under green light (Fig. 6(b)), the ANDs/ONI system shows a much better initiating performance than CQ/TEA except AND1/ONI. The weak absorption of A1 and CQ in the green light region may be responsible for their low initiating ability. At 60 s irradiation time, the double bond conversion can reach 60% and 64% for A2/ONI and A3/ONI, respectively, whereas CQ/TEA can only reach 20% at the same time. The FC shows an overall decrease around 10% compared to that under blue light, which may be because the energy of green light is relatively low.
Besides, the sensitizing efficiency of the ANDs was compared with that of anthracene. A violet LED (385 nm) was adopted because it is well known that anthracene only has absorption in ultraviolet regions. As shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†), the ANDs/ONI systems exhibit a more efficient initiating ability than the AN/ONI system. This result indicates that the sensitizing efficiency of the ANDs has been successfully improved.


3.4.2. Fluorescence quenching. 
It is widely accepted that the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) could take place in excited singlet or triplet states.41 Hence, the free energy changes related to the PET reaction between the ANDs and ONI were calculated according to eqn (3) to determine the dominating pathway. The corresponding data are listed in Table 4, showing that the ΔG is negative for both the excited singlet and triplet states. However, by taking the high fluorescence quantum efficiency of the ANDs into account, the PET was considered to mainly occur in the excited singlet state.
Fluorescence quenching experiments were then carried out to obtain the reaction constant (kq) between the ONI and the excited singlet state of the ANDs. As shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), the quenching effects for A1 and A2 prove that the PET reaction did occur. A linear relationship was found in the quenching phenomenon with the concentration of ONI; the Kq values were calculated using the Stern–Volmer equation (F0/F = 1 + Kqτ0[ONI]) and are presented in Table 4. The kq values (1010 M−1 s−1) for the A1/ONI and A2/ONI are rather high and close to the diffusion control limit. On this occasion, the absorption ability of the ANDs at the irradiation wavelength is the vital element. For example, the ANDs show a similar FRP performance under blue LED irradiation. However, the initiating efficiency of A1/ONI significantly decreased under green LED irradiation due to its weak absorption in the green light region.
 Fig. 7  Fluorescence quenching of (a) A1, (b) A2 and (c) A3 by different concentrations of ONI in THF. Inset: Stern–Volmer plots. 
When ONI (2 mM) was added to A3 solution, the original emission band disappeared immediately and a new emission band at around 516 nm emerged (Fig. 7(c)). Therefore, the Stern–Volmer equation was not applied to analyse the reaction constant between A3 and ONI. The new emission band may result from the product of the complex reaction occurred after the fast PET reaction between A3 and ONI.

4. Conclusions
This work contributes to the investigation of the substitution effects of four different electron donor groups, which may promote the rational design of functional molecules. By introducing these donors, the ANDs show strong absorption in blue/green regions and exhibit lowered redox potentials compared with anthracene. It has been established that these donors possess different electron donating abilities, which are decisive on the excited state ICT intensity of the designed molecules. Apart from the donating ability of the donors, the redox potential of the targeted compounds could be influenced by the conjugation degree among the donor groups and anthracene. The ANDs present outstanding one-photon photopolymerization sensitizing ability under blue/green LED irradiation because the interaction between the ANDs and ONI is very fast and the absorption ability of the ANDs at these wavelengths is very strong. Besides, the ANDs show great potential in sensitizing TPA-induced photopolymerization due to their large TPACS.
