    , Accepted 9th March 2021First published on 10th March 2021AbstractManganese-based flow batteries have attracted increasing interest due to their advantages of low cost and high energy density. However, the sediment (MnO2) from Mn3+ disproportionation reaction creates the risk of blocking pipelines, leading to poor stability. Herein, a titanium–manganese single flow battery (TMSFB) with high stability is designed and fabricated for the first time. In the design, a static cathode without the tank and pump is employed to avoid blockage of pipelines by MnO2 particles. Benefiting from the deceasing disproportionation reaction rate, MnO2 from the disproportionation reaction is fully utilized, realizing nearly two electron capacity. The novel TMSFB exhibits coulombic efficiency (CE) of over 99.0% at a current density of 40 mA cm−2. Most importantly, the TMSFB can run stably over 1000 cycles without capacity decay, demonstrating very good stability. With low cost, high efficiency and long cycle life, TMSFBs exhibit remarkable potential for large scale energy storage.
Introduction
Driven by the growing energy consumption and serious environmental problems, the utilization of renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, is becoming more and more important.1–3 To overcome the random and intermittent nature of renewable energy, an economical and reliable energy storage device is essential.4,5 Many battery technologies have emerged and developed.6–8 Flow battery is an ideal choice for large scale energy storage, due to its attractive features of high safety, high efficiency and long cycle life. At present, vanadium flow battery is one of the most promising and mature technologies.9 However, its relatively high cost and low energy density limit its further application.
Manganese-based batteries have attracted great attention owing to the low cost, rich reserves (8th most abundant metal on the earth) and the abundant oxidation states of manganese element.10,11 Among manganese-based couples, MnO2/MnOOH is commonly applied in primary alkaline batteries. The rechargeable ones were reported, but showed poor cycling performance owing to the structural collapse from the intercalation/de-intercalation process in solid/solid reactions.12,13
The liquid/liquid conversion reaction of the Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couple avoids the structural collapse and shows a high standard potential (1.51 V vs. SHE).14 However, during the charging process, Mn3+ ions in a positive electrolyte will disproportionate to Mn2+ and MnO2 spontaneously (eqn (2)), leading to a sharp decay of efficiency and capacity.15 Given that, researchers tried to skip Mn3+and utilize directly the liquid/solid conversion (Mn2+/MnO2).16–22 Yi Cui et al. achieved it by the special constant-potential charge mode, rather than the common galvanostatic charge mode in industry, which limited its industrial application.16–19 Another strategy is to introduce Brønsted acids like [Mn(H2O)6]2+ or Ac− in the near-neutral aqueous solution, achieving the reversible Mn2+/MnO2 reaction by the Brønsted acid–base or coordination interaction.20–22 However, in acidic aqueous solution with high ion conductivity, the interactions are hindered, wherein Mn3+ would be formed and the disproportionation reaction happens again.21
It has been found that Mn3+ could be stabilized by increasing the acid concentration or introducing suitable additives, such as TiO2+ and VO2+.23,24 Subsequently, Ti/Mn,25 V/Mn,26,27 Ti/V/Mn,28 and H/Mn29 flow batteries were reported. However, the poor cycle life (<160 cycles) gives rise to performances that are far from the market demand. Because the disproportionation reaction can't be completely inhibited, even though metal ion additives are present, MnO2 particles will adhere to pipelines, pumps and electrolyte tanks (Fig. S1†) with the flow of the electrolyte, which will in turn hinder the flow of the electrolyte and cause loss of active materials.
Herein we designed a novel titanium–manganese single flow battery (TMSFB) with a static manganese cathode by removing the tank and pump, where carbon felt with high porosity was filled with the electrolyte. The negative titanium electrolyte was circulated through the pump as before (Fig. S2† and Scheme 1). In the design, the positive manganese electrolyte remained stationary and was sealed in a chamber. On the one hand, the risk of MnO2 particles blocking the pipelines is avoided, favoring a long cycle life. On the other hand, active materials are thoroughly utilized in the charge–discharge process, and quasi-reversible access to two electron capacity is possibly achieved. Simultaneously, the novel structure avoids some issues like water transfer and oxidation of active materials by air. As a result, the TMSFB exhibited high energy efficiency (EE) and area capacity. Most importantly, a TMSFB with 1000 charge–discharge cycles was achieved, exhibiting a very promising prospect for large scale energy storage.

Results and discussion
A TMSFB was assembled with a Mn2+/Mn3+/MnO2 positive couple and Ti3+/TiO2+ negative couple where H2SO4 was the supporting electrolyte. Well-defined peaks were observed in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) plots of the negative electrolyte (Fig. 1a), indicating good electrochemical characteristics of Ti3+/TiO2+. For the Mn2+/Mn3+/MnO2 couple, the electrochemical behaviour is closely related to the electrolyte composition. Fig. 1b shows the CV plots of two kinds of positive electrolytes on a carbon felt working electrode in the potential range of 0.55 to 1.55 V. The electrolytes with different concentrations of MnSO4, TiOSO4 and H2SO4 are denoted as xMn–yTi–zH (Table S2†), where x, y, and z represent the concentration (moL L−1) of MnSO4, TiOSO4 and H2SO4, respectively. In Fig. 1b, only one oxidation peak at ∼1.4 V vs. SCE can be observed, corresponding to the oxidation of Mn2+ to Mn3+. There are two reduction peaks, which were assigned to the one-electron reaction of Mn3+ to Mn2+ and two-electron reaction of MnO2 to Mn2+, respectively. Obviously, the former reduction peak (Mn3+/Mn2+) intensity of 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H was lower than that of 0.5Mn–3H, which indicates that the addition of Ti ions would affect the electrochemical process.

The charge–discharge curves of TMSFBs with 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H and 0.5Mn–3H as positive electrolytes are shown in Fig. 1c. The reactions of the charge–discharge process are shown in eqn (1)–(6). In the negative half-cell, reversible electrochemical reactions of Ti3+/TiO2+ occur. In the positive half-cell, while Mn2+ is oxidized to Mn3+ during the charge process, Mn3+ is converted to Mn2+ and MnO2 by a chemical disproportionation reaction, and then, Mn2+ generated is further oxidized to Mn3+ by the electrochemical route. Herein, the kinetics of Mn2+/Mn3+ with the one-electron transfer is much faster than that of Mn2+/MnO2 with the direct electrochemical two-electron process.16–22 During the discharge process, Mn3+ and MnO2 are reduced to Mn2+ by the electrochemical route. Thus, the quasi-reversible two-electron reaction is achieved, where the capacity is 2 times that of the one-electron reaction (Mn2+/Mn3+).
Charge process: Positive: Mn2+ − e− → Mn3+(1) 2Mn3+ + 2H2O → MnO2 + 4H+ + Mn2+(2) Negative: TiO2+ + 2H+ + e− → Ti3+ + H2O(3)
Discharge process: Positive: Mn3+ + e− → Mn2+(4) MnO2 + 4H+ + 2e− → Mn2+ + 2H2O(5) Negative: Ti3+ + H2O − e− → TiO2+ + 2H+(6)
In Fig. 1c, at the initial stage, the slope of 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H is obviously larger than that of 0.5Mn–3H, which is attributed to different disproportionation reaction rates. For 0.5Mn–3H, once Mn3+ appears, disproportionation reaction will happen. Compared with 0.5Mn–3H, Ti ions in 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H would lower the disproportionation reaction rate, which could be proved by the morphology of the carbon felt electrode (Fig. S3†). For TMSFBs with SoC = 20%, MnO2 has been observed in 0.5Mn–3H but hardly any MnO2 is present in 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H. Hence, after the same charging time, Mn3+ concentration in 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H is higher than that of 0.5Mn–3H, Mn2+ concentration in 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H is lower than that of 0.5Mn–3H, leading to higher voltage for 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H according to the Nernst equation. At the later stage, Mn3+ accumulates in 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H and disproportionation reaction occurs. Mn3+ and Mn2+ concentrations are balanced in 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H, forming an obvious charge platform.
To further understand the electrochemical behaviours, TMSFBs with 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H and 0.5Mn–3H were evaluated (Fig. 1d, e and S4†). At a current density of 40 mA cm−2, obvious polarization was observed at the end of the charging plots of the TMSFB with 0.5Mn–3H (Fig. 1e); also, the CE and discharge capacity dropped dramatically (Fig. 1d). This is because there is massive accumulation of nonconductive MnO2 at the end of the discharge process, leading to the increase in internal resistance and the loss of active materials. By contrast, the TMSFB with 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H exhibited stable charge–discharge plots (Fig. 1e), CE and capacity retention (Fig. 1d), as MnO2 could be completely converted into Mn2+ without residues. The SEM images (Fig. 2) and elemental mapping (Fig. S5†) of the carbon felt surface verified it. For a TMSFB with 0.5Mn–3H, there was still a lot of bulky sediment remaining in the carbon felt at the end of the 1st discharge process. After 100 cycles, the carbon felt with 0.5Mn–3H was completely covered by the accumulated MnO2 particles. For 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H, few MnO2 particles were observed on the surface of the carbon felt even after 100 cycles. The results implied that the TMSFB with Ti ion additives exhibited stable performance, while the TMSFB without the additives failed after just 20 cycles.

In order to clarify the failure mechanism of the system without the additives and the function of Ti ions, we characterized the deposition morphology and chemical nature of MnO2. The SEM images of the carbon felt surface in the charge process are shown in Fig. 3a, b and S6.† For the TMSFB with 0.5Mn–3H, during the charge process, MnO2 particles are present as spindle-shaped flakes and TEM images indicate that the spindle shape has a length of 50 nm and width of 15 nm. In contrast, MnO2 particles generated in the TMSFB with 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H are very tiny and uniform. TEM images show that the particles possess a typical fibre-like shape with the size of 20 nm. The results state that the addition of Ti ions will affect the size and shape of MnO2 particles from the disproportionation reaction.

The deposition morphology of MnO2 in the charge–discharge process was also investigated in detail. For the TMSFB with 0.5Mn–3H, during the charge process, spindle-shaped MnO2 particles grow fiercely and unevenly wrap on the carbon fibre surface (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, MnO2 particles in the TMSFB with 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H uniformly deposit in the gap between carbon fibres rather than the fibre surface (Fig. 3b). The results are further confirmed by the elemental mapping of the carbon felt surface in Fig. 4.

The phenomenon is attributed to the effect of Ti ion additives on the disproportionation reaction rate. In the 0.5Mn–3H electrolyte, Mn3+ generated on the surface of carbon fibres rapidly gets converted into MnO2, wrapping on the fibre surface. In the 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H electrolyte, as mentioned above, the disproportionation reaction will be suppressed by Ti ions.23 Mn3+ on the fibre surface can't immediately get converted into MnO2. There is sufficient time for Mn3+ to migrate away from the fibre surface driven by the concentration gradient. Then the disproportionation reaction happens in the bulk solution. MnO2 deposits in the electrolyte rather than the fibre surface, where abundant carbon fibres are exposed and provide more active sites for electrochemical reaction during the charge–discharge process. The phenomenon further reveals that the Mn3+/Mn2+ peak intensity of 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H is lower than that of 0.5Mn–3H in the CV plots (Fig. 1b). For 0.5Mn–3H, the Mn3+ left after charging is wrapped by MnO2 on the fibre surface, favouring the electrochemical conversion of Mn3+/Mn2+. For 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H, the Mn3+ left after charging is in the electrolyte far from the fibre surface, which is unfavorable to the Mn3+/Mn2+ reaction (Scheme 1). That is, Ti ions in 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H would promote the reaction of MnO2 to Mn2+.
Meanwhile, the deposition of MnO2 in the bulk solution provides large space for the dispersion of MnO2, rather than agglomerating together. Therefore, the existence of Ti ions makes the size of MnO2 particles smaller. The small particles in 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H have a bigger specific surface area to contact with the electrode, thus making it easier to be reduced. In addition, the cathode-downward style facilitates the process, where the electrode is placed horizontally and the positive one is at the bottom (Fig. S2† and Scheme 1). Due to the cathode-downward style, the nonconductive MnO2 would pass through the holes of the carbon felt and deposit on the current collector under the gravity effect. In the discharge process, the intimate contact between MnO2 and the current collector makes it easier to be entirely reduced to Mn2+, as shown in Scheme 1. The small particles in the bulk solution sink under the gravity effect, until they fully touch the current collector and are entirely reduced. However, for 0.5Mn–3H, during the discharge process, the innermost MnO2 wrapped on carbon fibre first reacts, which will result in the outer MnO2 falling off carbon fibres in the shape of large blocks (Fig. 2b) due to uneven aggregation of big particles. In this case, the block-like MnO2 touches carbon fibre by point contact, seriously affecting the reduction of MnO2.
The sediments from TMSFBs with 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H and 0.5Mn–3H after charging were detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The sediments were obtained by rinsing carbon felts with water under ultrasound or without it. For 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H, the sediments demonstrate a type of ξ-MnO2 (JPCDS: 30-0820), where the peaks at 37.1, 42.4, 56.0 and 66.8° correspond to (100), (101), (102) and (110) crystal planes respectively. The peaks at ∼26.0 correspond to the graphite from carbon felt. For 0.5Mn–3H under ultrasound, two crystal types (α-MnO2 and ξ-MnO2) were observed. Herein, the peak at 66.8° represents ξ-MnO2, the peaks at 12.9, 18.3, 28.8, 37.6, 42.1, 49.8, 56.1, 60.1, 65.4, 69.2 and 73.1° correspond to (110), (200), (310), (211), (301), (411), (600), (521), (002), (541) and (312) crystal planes of α-MnO2 (JPCDS: 44-0141). Furthermore, the HRTEM images (Fig. 3e) also prove the crystal structure, where lattice spacings of 0.16, 0.23 and 0.31 nm correspond to the (521), (211) and (310) planes of α-MnO2, respectively. It is worth noting that only ξ-MnO2 was observed for 0.5Mn–3H in the absence of ultrasound. It is likely that α-MnO2 is formed first and tightly wraps on the carbon fibres, which cannot be washed without the use of ultrasound. In addition, the peaks of 0.5Mn–3H are sharper than those of 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H, indicating that 0.5Mn–3H has a bigger particle size according to the Debye–Scherrer formula. In addition, compared with α-MnO2, ξ-MnO2 contains numerous planar defects,30 favouring the electrochemical reaction.
The chemical nature of sediments was further confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results of high resolution Mn2p, Mn3s, and Ti2p orbitals are shown in Fig. 5b–e and Table S3.† The Mn2p and Mn3s peaks of 0.5Mn–3H and 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H are similar. Binding energies of 642.8 and 654.1 eV correspond to Mn2p3/2 and Mn2p1/2 orbitals, respectively. The splitting energy of 4.8 eV, obtained for Mn3s orbitals, reveals that the sediments mostly consist of MnO2. Additionally, in 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H, two peaks of Ti2p orbitals at 458.5 and 464.2 eV, with a splitting energy of 5.7 eV, and the little satellite peak, correspond to TiO2, which is derived from the hydrolysis reaction of TiOSO4 during the preparation of samples. TiO2 is also observed in the HRTEM images (Fig. 3f), where the lattice spacing of 0.33 nm corresponds to the (110) plane of rutile-TiO2 (JPCDS: 21-1276). Therefore, there is no bonding interaction between Ti and Mn atoms, and no new substance except MnO2 is found in the sediments.

To sum up, the failure of the TMSFB without the additives is because the rapid disproportionation reaction results in uneven deposition of MnO2 with large particles and low activity. With the addition of Ti ions, the slow disproportionation reaction helps in the formation of small size, uniformly deposited and high-activity crystal structures, which favour its reduction process. To further illustrate the effect of the inhibition function, another metal ion without the inhibition function like copper ion was tried. As expected, the performance of the single flow battery with 0.5Mn–0.5Cu–3H decayed rapidly. 0.5Mn–0.5Cu–3H represents the solution with 0.5 moL L−1 MnSO4, 0.5 moL L−1 CuSO4 and 3 moL L−1 H2SO4. After 30 cycles, only ∼15% capacity was retained (Fig. S7†). These results suggest that the inhibition function of Ti ions plays an important role and it is wise to add Ti ions to the positive electrolyte. In addition, the common electrolytes in the anode and cathode before charging weaken the impact of ion crossover and the cost of electrolyte recovery.
As shown in Fig. 6a, a dramatic increase in cycle life has been achieved benefiting from this novel design and Ti ion additives. The TMSFB with 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H maintained a very stable performance without obvious efficiency decay after continuously running for over 1000 cycles, showing great progress in the stability and reliability of titanium–manganese flow batteries.

Meanwhile, we explored the effect of H2SO4 concentration on cycling stability (Fig. 6b and S8†). When the H2SO4 concentration is 2 M, the CE, VE and the discharge capacity of the TMSFB with 0.5Mn–1Ti–2H decay with the cycles. CE reaches the highest value of 98.7% (<99.0%) at the 2nd cycle, the electrode is fully soaked and activated after the first cycle. And after 137 cycles, the TMSFB is dead with a sharp decay of capacity. When the H2SO4 concentration is raised to 3 M or 4 M, a CE of over 99.0% is achieved and the TMSFB can stably run over 1000 cycles. It means that MnO2 can't be totally reduced at the low H2SO4 concentration, hence high H2SO4 concentration favours the process. The phenomenon is explained by eqn (2) and (5). Based on eqn (2), the increase of H+ concentration will push the balance to the left hand side, reduce the disproportionation reaction rate and favour the dispersion of MnO2 and the formation of small particles. According to eqn (5), the increase of H+ concentration will push the balance of eqn (5) to the right hand side and facilitate the reduction of MnO2. Moreover, the CV plots of the electrolytes with different H2SO4 concentrations also verified this observation (Fig. 6c). The Mn3+/Mn2+ peak intensities of 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H and 0.5Mn–1Ti–4H are lower than that of 0.5Mn–1Ti–2H, which means a higher H2SO4 concentration will enhance the activity of MnO2 in the reduction reaction.
To evaluate the effect of MnO2 deposition amount, TMSFBs with different SoC values and volume of positive electrolyte were investigated. TMSFBs with different SoC values (Fig. 7a and S9†) show similar charge profiles and efficiency. There is no obvious polarization even though the battery is charged from 50% SoC to 90% SoC. Likewise, thicker electrodes (5, 6, 10, 12 mm) at the positive side (Table S1†) are used to increase the volume of the electrolyte; the TMSFB (SoC = 90%) with a 12 mm electrode only suffers from a very slight efficiency decay and achieves a high energy efficiency of about 85.0% as well as a current density of 40 mA cm−2 (Fig. 7b and S10†). The results demonstrate that nonconductive MnO2 deposition amount has little influence on the internal resistance and performance of the battery, benefiting from the small size of MnO2 particles, high H+ concentration and highly electroconductive 3D porous carbon electrode.

(c) The rate performance of the TMSFB with 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H. (d) The cycle life of the TMSFB with 1Mn–1Ti–3H (area capacity = 30 mA h cm−2). 
The rate performance of the TMSFB with 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H, closely related to the cost and size of the flow battery system, was evaluated and is shown in Fig. 7c and S11.† As the current density increases from 20 mA cm−2 to 80 mA cm−2, the CE of the TMSFB increases from 98.3% to 99.1% owing to the decreasing crossover. And VE drops from 92.1% to 79.1% due to the rising ohmic and electrochemical polarization. Even at a high current density of 80 mA cm−2, the TMSFB with 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H shows stable performance with EE of 78.4%.
To increase the energy density and area capacity, a high concentration electrolyte, 1Mn–1Ti–3H was tried. Luckily, the TMSFB with 1Mn–1Ti–3H could still exhibit high and stable efficiency similar to that with 0.5Mn–1Ti–3H, showing high discharge energy (∼880 mW h) at the current density of 40 mA cm−2 (Fig. S12†). Furthermore, most importantly, with an area capacity as high as 30 mA h cm−2, the battery could also be operated for more than 50 cycles without any capacity and efficiency decay (Fig. 7d).
Conclusions
In summary, a novel TMSFB with high efficiency, ultra-long life and low cost is designed and fabricated for the first time. Benefiting from the structural design of the single flow battery, MnO2 from a disproportionation reaction is fully utilized firstly, and the quasi-reversible Mn2+/MnO2 electrochemical reaction is realized. The structure not only reduces the cost by removing the tank and pump of the positive side, but also inhibits the water transfer and air oxidation. Meanwhile, the failure mechanism of the TMSFB without additives and the function of Ti ions are illustrated in detail. Ti ions lead to a slow disproportionation reaction, further aiding the formation of small size, uniformly deposited and high-activity crystal structures, promoting the reduction process of MnO2 from the disproportionation reaction. Thus, one strategy to utilize MnO2 from the disproportionation reaction is provided, which may provide an inspiration for the study of manganese-based batteries. Furthermore, electrolytes with different compositions and concentrations are optimized. As a result, over 99.0% of CE and as long as 1000 cycles are realized at the current density of 40 mA cm−2, verifying the effectiveness and reliability of the TMSFB system. Last but not least, a high areal capacity of 30 mA h cm−2 is achieved. The stable and long-life TMSFB is expected to be a promising candidate system for large scale energy storage.
