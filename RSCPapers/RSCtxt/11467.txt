    , Accepted 8th April 2011First published on 23rd May 2011AbstractThis work provides a new approach for the solution processable synthesis of metal–graphene oxide nanocomposites in aqueous solutions at ambient conditions. Using 532 nm laser or tungsten lamp irradiation of a mixture of graphene oxide (GO) and metal ions derived from HAuCl4 or AgNO3 we report the photocatalytic reduction of the metal ions simultaneously with partial reduction of GO, and the synthesis of metal–graphene nanocomposites. The gold and silver ions are reduced following the laser or the tungsten lamp irradiation of GO for a few minutes in water–ethanol, water–polyethylene glycol (PEG) or pure water solvents. The reduction of GO in the presence of ethanol or PEG is much faster than in pure water under identical experimental conditions. This is attributed to the role of ethanol or PEG in scavenging the holes generated by the irradiation of GO thus leaving the photogenerated electrons to reduce GO. In pure water in the presence of gold ions, partial reduction of GO occurs due to the efficient capturing of the photogenerated electrons in GO by the gold ions and the strong absorption of the 532 nm photons by the newly formed Au nanoparticles. Strong photothermal effects are observed leading to a significant increase in the temperature of the solution and suggesting that metal–graphene nanocomposites could be promising materials for the efficient conversion of solar energy into usable heat for a variety of thermal, thermochemical and thermomechanical applications.
1. Introduction
The isolation of graphene in 2004 has triggered an extensive amount of research on the synthesis and characterization of this 2-D material motivated by a common goal of exploiting its unique properties for a wide variety of applications ranging from high-speed transistors, energy conversion devices such as nanostructured solar cells, fuel cells, transparent conducting films, and sensors to heterogeneous catalysis, and reinforced polymer nanocomposites.1–10 The recognition of this important new area of research and its tremendous potential applications have been highlighted by awarding the 2010 Nobel Prize in physics to Geim and Novoselov for “groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene”.11
In addition to the unique electronic properties of graphene, other properties such as high thermal, chemical and mechanical stability as well as high surface area also represent desirable characteristics as 2-D support layers for metallic and bimetallic nanoparticles in heterogeneous catalysis.12–25 Recent advances in the production of graphene sheets through the reduction of exfoliated graphite oxide (GO) have provided efficient approaches for the large scale production of chemically converted graphene (CCG) sheets which can be readily used as a catalyst support.26–34 The large surface area (2600 m2 g−1, theoretical value) of graphene and its high thermal and chemical stability provide an excellent catalyst support.4,5,12,13,34 Although several methods have been reported for the synthesis of metal–GO and metal–graphene nanocomposites, most of the approaches involve the use of chemical reducing agents,26–34 and there are only a few reports on the photocatalytic reduction of GO using photocatalysts such as TiO2,15ZnO,35BiVO4,36 and polyoxometalate.37 The main advantage of using photochemical and photothermal reduction methods to prepare metal nanoparticles supported on graphene is to avoid the use of toxic chemical reducing agents thus providing a green approach for the synthesis and processing of metal–graphene nanocomposites.36–41 Also for applications in catalysis, it is desirable to completely remove any trace reducing or capping agents from the surface of the supported nanocatalysts since these organic species tend to significantly reduce the catalytic activity and poison the nanoparticle catalysts.12 Other advantages include better control of the reduction processes without the need of high temperatures, and the possibility of reducing two or more different metal ions on the graphene surface which could produce graphene nanocomposites with interesting catalytic, magnetic and optical properties.
Although fully oxidized GO is an insulator, partially oxidized GO has semiconductor properties with a band gap that is determined by the extent of oxygenation of graphite.8,42–44 This is due to the local changes in the carbon hybridization from sp2 to sp3 as oxidation of graphite sheets takes place. Band gap energies between 2.5 and 4.0 eV have been calculated for an O/C ratio > 0.5.43 We have recently developed a facile laser reduction method for the synthesis of Laser Converted Graphene (LCG) from GO, and reported the first direct measurements of the temperature rise in water resulting from the photothermal deoxygenation of GO.41 Absorption of a single 355 nm photon (3.5 eV) or two 532 nm photons by GO excites valence-to-conduction transitions (2.3 eV) which generates electron–hole pairs within the semiconductor GO followed by non-radiative recombination which results in efficient energy conversion.40,41 Since electron-lattice temperature equilibrium occurs on the picosecond time scale,45,46 the resulting thermal energy is sufficient for the rapid removal of O2, CO, CO2 and H2O from GO thus forming deoxygenated GO (or reduced GO).38,40,41 In addition to the photothermal effects, we anticipate that the generation of electron–hole pairs in GO in the presence of a hole scavenger molecule such as alcohol or glycol will be highly efficient in activating the reduction of GO. Furthermore, in the presence of metal ions, reduction of the metal ions could take place thus producing metal nanoparticles supported on the reduced or partially reduced graphene oxide. In this paper we describe our findings regarding the laser photoreduction of GO and the metal ions and the formation of metal–graphene nanocomposites. First, we demonstrate that GO can be reduced by the 532 nm laser irradiation in reducing environments such as methanol–water, ethanol–water or polyethylene glycol (PEG)–water mixtures much more efficiently than in pure water. Second, we demonstrate that gold and silver ions can be reduced by laser irradiation of GO, and compare the efficiency of the photocatalytic reduction of the metal ions by GO in different solvent environments namely ethanol–water, PEG–water and pure water. Third, we evaluate the photothermal effects associated with the photocatalytic reduction of the metal ions in the presence of GO. Fourth, we demonstrate that similar reduction processes of gold ions can take place using a tungsten–halogen lamp instead of a pulsed laser source thus providing a rationale for using solar energy for photocatalytic reduction of metal ions in the presence of GO. Finally, we provide plausible mechanisms for the photocatalytic reduction by GO in different solvent environments.
2. Experimental section
In the experiments, GO was prepared by the oxidation of high purity graphite powder (99.9999%, 200 mesh, Alfa Aesar) according to the method of Hummers and Offeman.47 After repeated washing of the resulting yellowish-brown cake with hot water, the powder was dried at room temperature under vacuum overnight. 2 mg of the dried GO was sonicated in 10 mL of deionized water (or 50 vol% ethanol–water or 2 vol% PEG–water mixture) until a homogeneous yellow dispersion was obtained. The chemicals used were: absolute methanol certified ACS with purity 99.9%, absolute ethanol anhydrous ACS/USP grade, and polyethylene glycol 400 (CarboWax® PEG 400, Mw: 380–420).
For the reduction of GO alone, 3 mL of the GO solution was irradiated with a pulsed Nd:YAG laser (unfocused, 2nd harmonic λ = 532 nm, hν = 2.32 eV, pulse width τ = 7 ns, repetition rate = 30 Hz, fluence ≈ 0.1 J cm−2, Spectra Physics LAB-170-30) under continuous stirring. For the Au–GO experiments, hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O, Sigma Aldrich, 30 wt% Au(III) chloride solution in dilute HCl, with purity of 99.99%) was added to the GO solutions according to the amounts specified in the figure captions of the data. For the Ag nanoparticles, 25 mg of AgNO3 (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to 3 mL GO (2 mg per 10 mL) solutions before the laser irradiation experiments.
The tungsten–halogen lamp used was 500 W. The distance between center of the sample and light source was 35 cm and no filters were used. The temperature of the solution was monitored during irradiation using a thermocouple immersed in the solution.
The LCG sheets and the metal–LCG nanocomposites were separated and dried overnight under vacuum before the XRD or the XPS measurements. TEM images were obtained using a Joel JEM-1230 electron microscope operated at 120 kV equipped with a Gatan UltraScan 4000SP 4k × 4k CCD camera. Absorption spectra were recorded using a Hewlett–Packard HP-8453 diode array spectrophotometer. The X-ray diffraction patterns were measured with an X'Pert Philips Materials Research Diffractometer using Cu Kα1 radiation. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250 using a monochromatic Al KR.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Laser assisted photoreduction of GO in different solvents

Fig. 1a displays XRD data of the LCG obtained after the 532 nm (4 W, 30 Hz) irradiation of GO for 10 min in different solvents. The XRD pattern of the exfoliated GO (Fig. 1a) is characterized by a peak at 2θ = 10.9° corresponding to a d-spacing of 8.14 Å resulting from the insertion of hydroxyl and epoxy groups between the graphite sheets as a result of the oxidation process of graphite.26–28,31,41 As shown in Fig. 1a, following the 532 nm laser irradiation for a few minutes, the yellow golden color of the GO solution changes to black with complete disappearance of the XRD 10.9° peak thus indicating the reduction of GO and the restoration of the sp2carbon sites in the LCG.28,41 The irradiation time required for the reduction of GO varies from a few to several minutes depending on the nature of the solvent, the laser power, the concentration of GO and the volume of the solution. For example, under identical conditions of GO concentration (0.2 mg mL−1), solution volume (3 mL) and laser power (4 W, 30 Hz), the reduction of GO is completed after 5, 8, and 10 min in 50 vol% ethanol–water, 2 vol% PEG–water and pure water, respectively.

(e) TEM images of LCG prepared in 50% ethanol–water (top), 2% PEG–water (middle) and pure water (bottom). The digital photographs in (a) display the changes in the golden color of the GO solution after laser irradiation in different solvents as indicated. 

Fig. 1b compares the FT-IR spectra of GO and the LCG following the 532 nm (4 W, 30 Hz) irradiation for 10 min in 50 vol% ethanol–water, 2 vol% PEG–water and pure water. The GO spectrum shows strong bands corresponding to the CO stretching vibrations of the COOH groups at 1740 cm−1, the O–H deformations of the C–OH groups at 1350–1390 cm−1, the C–O stretching vibrations at 1060–1100 cm−1, and the epoxide groups (1230 cm−1).29,30,48 These bands are almost completely absent from the spectrum of the LCG thus confirming the conversion of GO into graphene following the 532 nm laser irradiation.
The UV-Vis spectrum of GO is characterized by significant absorption below 400 nm with a characteristic shoulder at 305 nm attributed to n → π* transitions of CO bonds.49 With the 532 nm laser irradiation, two photon absorption is expected to contribute significantly to the absorption of the laser energy by GO due to excited state nonlinearities which enhance the two-photon absorption of GO at 532 nm in the nanosecond regime.42,50Fig. 1c compares the UV-Vis spectra of GO following the 532 nm laser irradiation in 50% ethanol–water and 2% PEG–water mixtures, and in pure water. In all cases, the characteristic shoulder of GO at 305 nm disappears after laser irradiation, and the absorption peak of GO at 230 nm red shifts to about 270 nm due to the π → π* transitions of extended aromatic C–C bonds as the electronic conjugation within graphene is restored in the LCG.41,48,49
The XPS C1s spectrum of GO shows peaks corresponding to oxygen-containing groups between 285.5 and 289 eV, in addition to the sp2-bonded carbon CC at 284.5 eV (Fig. 1d). Typically, peaks at 285.6, 286.7, 287.7 and 289 are assigned to the C1s of the C–OH, C–O, CO, and HO–CO groups, respectively.28,51,52 The XPS data of the LCG in 50% ethanol–water, 2% PEG–water, and pure water clearly indicate that most of the oxygen-containing groups in GO are removed after the laser irradiation. The TEM images of the reduced GO, displayed in Fig. 1d, show wrinkled and partially folded sheets with a lateral dimension of up to a few microns in length. No obvious differences are observed in the TEM images of the LCG in different solvent environments.
As indicated above, the reduction of GO in the presence of ethanol or PEG is much faster than in pure water under identical solution volume, concentration and laser power conditions. For example, 532 nm irradiation with 1 W laser power (30 Hz) converts GO in pure water into graphene in about 40 min (7.2 × 103 laser pulses), while in the presence of 50 vol% ethanol or 2 vol% PEG, the same concentration of GO can be reduced in about 22, or 32 min, respectively. Obviously, the ethanol and PEG solutions exhibit higher reduction efficiencies than pure water.39,53,54 This is attributed to the role of ethanol or PEG in scavenging the holes generated by the laser irradiation of GO. We also observe the evolution of gas bubbles (most likely H2) during the laser irradiation of GO in different solvent environments (see Video, ESI†). It is interesting to note that the rate of gas evolution from the laser irradiation of GO in aqueous methanol solution is higher than that in an ethanol–water solution and much higher than the rate measured in pure water (Fig. S1, ESI†). These results are in full agreement with the recently published work of Yeh et al. which showed that GO under irradiation with UV or visible light photocatalyzes H2 production from 20 vol% aqueous methanol solution and pure water.55 Also, the amount of H2 produced from the mercury-lamp irradiation of GO in aqueous methanol solution was much more than that produced in pure water. However, the time course of the production of H2 using visible light irradiation was several hours (up to 12 hours) in comparison with the few minutes of laser irradiation in our experiments. Following the absorption of two photons by GO in the laser irradiation experiments and the generation of electron–hole (e–h) pairs, the holes are scavenged by methanol, ethanol or PEG thus leaving the photogenerated electrons for the injection into the solution phase for the H2 production and for the reduction of GO. It is likely that mutual photocatalytic reduction between different GO sheets occurs at the early stages of the photocatalytic reaction. The increased efficiency of H2 production by irradiation of GO in alcohol–water mixtures as compared to pure water is attributed to the role of alcohol as a sacrificial hole scavenger which interacts effectively with the photogenerated holes in the VB of GO to prevent electron–hole recombination. However, in pure water in the absence of hole scavengers, the holes generated in the valence band of GO may not be positive enough to oxidize water to O2 and therefore, the process is expected to be very slow, consistent with the experimental observations, and it may also result in the formation of other oxidation products such as hydrogen peroxides.
3.2. Photoreduction of gold ions and GO in different solvents

Fig. 2a compares the absorption spectra of GO solutions containing the same amount of HAuCl4 in 50 vol% ethanol–water and 2 vol% PEG–water mixtures and in pure water before and after the 532 nm irradiation (4 W, 30 Hz) for 2 min. The reduction of the gold ions and formation of Au nanoparticles are clearly evident by the observation of the Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) band of Au nanoparticles (527–531 nm)56,57 as shown in Fig. 2a.
 Fig. 2  (a) Absorption spectra of 25 μL HAuCl4 + GO in 50 vol% ethanol–water, 2 vol% PEG–water and pure water recorded after two minutes of laser irradiation (532 nm, 4 W, 30 Hz). Dotted lines represent data of blank solutions containing the same amount of HAuCl4 but no GO under identical laser irradiation conditions. (b) Absorption spectra of the same solutions in (a) irradiated with lower laser power (532 nm, 1 W, 30 Hz) showing no formation of gold nanoparticles in the pure water solution (black). 
It is clear that laser excitation of GO is involved in the reduction of the Au ions since irradiation of the HAuCl4 solutions in the absence of GO under identical conditions does not result in the formation of Au nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 2a. In the three solvent systems, an increase in the SPR band intensity of the Au nanoparticles with increasing the laser irradiation time from 2 to 10 min is observed (Fig. S2–S4, ESI†) thus providing direct evidence for increasing the nanoparticles' concentration with the number of photons absorbed by GO. This confirms that the reduction of the Au ions is directly coupled with the absorption of the 532 nm photons by GO. Furthermore, the SPR band of Au nanoparticles shows a systematic red shift with irradiation time indicating the formation of larger or aggregated Au nanoparticles at longer irradiation times (Fig. S2–S4, ESI†).56 For example, the SPR band shifts from 531 nm after 2 min irradiation to 548 nm after 6 min irradiation of GO in the 50 vol% ethanol–water mixture (Fig. S2, ESI†). Similarly, the SPR band shifts from 535 nm to 558 nm after 2 min and 10 min irradiation times, respectively of GO in the 2% PEG–water mixture (Fig. S3, ESI†). The red shift in the SPR band is attributed to the formation of large aggregated Au nanoparticles as confirmed by the TEM images showing the presence of particles in the size range of 30–70 nm after 10 min irradiation (Fig. S2–S4, ESI†). These large particles are formed via an Ostwald ripening process where the initially formed small particles with higher surface energies are consumed in the growth of the large particles with lower surface energies at longer irradiation times.58 Selective formation of small Au nanoparticles can be achieved by decreasing the concentration of HAuCl4 and using shorter irradiation times where the Ostwald ripening process can be minimized.58
The increase in the SPR band intensity of the Au nanoparticles for the 50 vol% ethanol and the 2 vol% PEG solutions as compared to pure water (Fig. 2a) is attributed to increasing the concentration of the Au nanoparticles in the presence of ethanol or PEG consistent with the increased reduction efficiencies of these solutions over pure water. At low laser power (1 W, 30 Hz), the reduction of the Au ions is not observed in pure water as indicated by the absence of the SPR band of Au nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 2b. This suggests that the laser reduction mechanism is different in water than in the presence of alcohol or PEG.

Fig. 3 displays TEM images of the Au nanoparticles dispersed on the surface of the LCG graphene sheets formed by the 2 min laser irradiation of the GO solutions containing the same amount of HAuCl4 in 50 vol% ethanol–water and 2 vol% PEG–water mixtures and in pure water. It is clear that the concentration of the Au nanoparticles formed in the GO–water solution is significantly lower than the concentration formed in the presence of ethanol or PEG. Again, this is a consequence of the favorable reducing environment created by ethanol or PEG as compared to water.

The XRD patterns of GO before and after laser irradiation in the presence of HAuCl4 in the 50 vol% ethanol–water mixture show the disappearance of the characteristic diffraction peak of GO at 2θ = 10.9° as shown in Fig. 4a. However, irradiation of GO in water in the presence of HAuCl4 shows that a small GO peak remains in the XRD suggesting that only a partial reduction of GO takes place. On the other hand, the XRD pattern of Au is clearly observed in the resulting Au–LCG nanocomposites formed by laser irradiation of the GO solutions containing the same amount of HAuCl4 as shown in Fig. 4b. We observe a systematic decrease in the extent of reduction of GO by the 532 nm irradiation as the concentration of HAuCl4 in the GO solution increases as evident by the increase in the intensity of the XRD peak of GO at 2θ = 10.9° as shown in Fig. 4c. This is also accompanied by an increase in the intensity of the SPR of Au nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 4d, indicating the formation of more Au nanoparticles. However, in the absence of HAuCl4, 532 nm irradiation of GO in water results in complete disappearance of the XRD peak of GO as shown in Fig. 1a.41 This indicates that both the Au ions and the sp2 regions of GO compete for the photogenerated electrons with the Au ions being more efficient in capturing the electrons thus resulting in the formation of Au nanoparticles and partially reduced GO.

(b) XRD data of Au nanoparticles incorporated within partially reduced GO. (c) XRD data obtained after the 532 nm laser irradiation (4 W, 30 Hz) of GO in water containing different amounts of HAuCl4 as indicated. (d) Absorption spectra of GO solutions in water containing different amounts of HAuCl4 as indicated after the 532 nm laser irradiation. The digital photographs in (d) display the changes in the colors of the irradiated HAuCl4–GO solutions. 
The partial reduction of GO in the presence of the Au ions is attributed to the efficiency of the Au ions in capturing the photogenerated electrons. It is also possible that the strong absorption of the 532 nm photons by the Au nanoparticles (due to the SPR ∼530 nm)56,57 decreases the probability of the two-photon absorption by GO. This would result in decreasing both the number of the photogenerated electrons needed for the reduction of GO as well as the photothermal energy conversion. To confirm this point we compare the above results involving irradiation of GO in the presence of Au ions with the reduction of GO in the presence of Ag ions as presented in the next section.
3.3. Photoreduction of silver ions and GO in different solvents
Similar to the formation of Au nanoparticles, irradiation of GO in water by the 532 nm laser in the presence of AgNO3 results in the formation of Ag nanoparticles. This is evident from the observation of the SPR band of Ag nanoparticles ∼420 nm shown in Fig. 5a,57 and the TEM images of the reduced graphene oxide-containing Ag nanoparticles shown in Fig. 5b. The XRD patterns of GO before and after laser irradiation in the presence of AgNO3 in the 50 vol% ethanol–water mixture as well as in pure water show the disappearance of the GO peak at 2θ = 10.9° as shown in Fig. 5c. This result is different from the Au3+ experiments where only partial reduction of GO was observed as indicated by the incomplete disappearance of the GO peak following the irradiation of the HAuCl4–GO solution. Furthermore, the XPS spectra of the Ag–graphene nanocomposites prepared in 50% ethanol–water and in pure water clearly indicate that most of the oxygen-containing groups in GO have been removed after laser irradiation as shown in Fig. 5d. The XPS C1s spectrum of the Ag–graphene nanocomposite (Fig. 5d) is very different from the corresponding spectrum of the Au–partially reduced graphene oxide (Fig. S5, ESI†). Therefore, it appears that the partial reduction of GO in the presence of the Au ions could be explained by the rapid reduction of the Au ions and the strong absorption of the 532 nm photons by the resulting Au nanoparticles.

(d) XPS (C1s) spectra of GO and reduced GO containing Ag nanoparticles prepared after five minutes laser irradiation (532 nm, 4 W, 30 Hz) of AgNO3–GO solutions in different solvents as indicated. 
3.4. Photothermal effects of laser irradiated Au3+/GO and Ag+/GO solutions
To shed more light on the mechanisms involved in the reduction of GO in the presence of metal ions, we measured the temperature rise of the Au3+/GO and Ag+/GO solutions in the 50 vol% ethanol–water, the 2 vol % PEG–water mixtures and in pure water during the 532 nm laser irradiation. The results for the 50 vol% ethanol–water mixture are shown in Fig. 6. The results for the 2 vol% PEG–water mixture and for pure water are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†).
 Fig. 6  Temperature changes during laser irradiation (532 nm, 4 W, 30 Hz) of GO solutions (3 mL solution, 2 mg GO per 10 mL 50 vol% ethanol–water) containing HAuCl4 and AgNO3. Comparisons with the HAuCl4 and AgNO3 solutions without GO under identical laser irradiation conditions are shown. 
The temperature rise reflects the steady state net heat transfer to the solution following the absorption of the 532 nm photons by GO. It is clear that laser irradiation of the metal ion solutions in the absence of GO does not show any significant temperature rise under identical conditions as shown in Fig. 6. Therefore, it can be concluded that the temperature rise of the GO solutions containing metal ions following the 532 nm irradiation is mainly due to the photothermal energy conversion by GO and the LCG.41 Similar trends have been observed for the Au and Ag ions in the GO solutions of 2 vol% PEG–water and pure water (Fig. S6, ESI†). It is reasonable to assume that the temperature rise of the irradiated solution in the presence of a GO–metal ion mixture is qualitatively related to the extent of the photothermal energy conversion of GO. Since the photothermal effects appear to be similar in the presence and absence of the metal ions, it can be concluded that the presence of metal ions has little effect on the photothermal energy conversion by GO.
To investigate the stability of the Au nanoparticles–GO mixture, repeated 532 nm irradiation cycles (5 min irradiation time at 30 Hz) were performed on the same HAuCl4–GO solution. In each cycle, the solution was allowed to cool down to room temperature after the laser had been turned off. We found that the color of the solution changes from red during the first irradiation cycle (indicating the formation of the Au nanoparticles) to dark red to violet to blue with successive irradiation cycles. The temperature rise of the solution increases after each cycle for a number of cycles that depends on the laser power. The increase in the temperature of the solution is attributed to the photothermal energy conversion by the Au nanoparticles which strongly absorb the 532 nm photons. Fig. 7a shows the temperature profiles of repeated irradiation cycles of the HAuCl4–GO solution using a 2 W average laser power. The results show that the temperature of the solution increases from 36 °C to 47 °C during the 7th cycle. However, during the 8th cycle the temperature reaches only 41 °C and the solution color changes to dark blue. This suggests that the drop in the efficiency of the photothermal energy conversion is associated with the formation of large aggregated Au nanoparticles. The formation of large aggregates of Au nanoparticles after repeated laser irradiation cycles is clearly evident from the observed red shift of the SPR band of the Au nanoparticles from 530 nm after the 2nd irradiation cycle (2 W, 30 Hz) to 546 nm after the 6th cycle as shown in Fig. 7b. After the deactivating 8th cycle, a significant decrease in the SPR band intensity is also observed accompanied by a strong red shift to 557 nm with the appearance of a broad continuum absorption extended to 900 nm as shown in Fig. 7b. These results indicate that the deactivation of the photothermal effect of the Au nanoparticles–GO system is attributed to the formation of large aggregates which absorb more toward the red but without well-defined SPR bands.

(b) Absorption spectra of the HAuCl4 + GO solution recorded after different irradiation cycles using the 532 nm laser irradiation with an average laser power of 2 W. 
3.5. Photocatalytic reduction using tungsten–halogen lamp
To explore the application of solar energy for the photocatalytic reduction of GO and gold ions, we used a 500 W tungsten–halogen lamp as a model for the solar energy. Irradiation of a 10 mL GO solution containing 10 μL HAuCl4 results in the formation of Au nanoparticles within a few minutes as evident by the observation of the SPR band at 530 nm and the TEM image of Au nanoparticles formed on the GO sheets shown in Fig. 8. It is interesting to note that the Au nanoparticles formed in pure ethanol are much smaller than those formed in water or 10% ethanol in water. The particles also appear to assemble in the form of separated clusters consisting of small Au nanoparticles. This could be related to efficient reduction of the Au ions upon irradiation of the GO in ethanol. This effect could lead to increased supersaturation of the reduced Au ions which could lead to higher nucleation rates and formation of small size Au nanoparticles.59
 Fig. 8  (a) Absorption spectra of 10 μL HAuCl4 + GO (1 mg in 10 mL water) recorded after 20 and 60 minutes irradiation with the tungsten–halogen lamp (500 W). The distance between center of the sample and light source was 25 cm and no filters were used. TEM images of Au nanoparticles incorporated into reduced GO obtained after 20 min irradiation of the HAuCl4 + GO solutions in (b) water, (c) 10 vol% ethanol–water, and (d) pure ethanol under identical irradiation conditions. 
Similar to the laser irradiation experiments, no Au nanoparticles are formed when the HAuCl4 aqueous solution is irradiated in the absence of GO, thus confirming that the Au ions are reduced via the absorption of photons by GO. Furthermore, the reduction of the Au ions is much more efficient in the presence of ethanol consistent with the 532 nm laser irradiation results. Therefore, the main features of the photocatalytic reduction of GO and metal ions observed using pulse laser irradiation are reproduced by using the tungsten–halogen lamp. This demonstrates the possibility of using solar energy for the photoreduction of metal ions–GO mixtures and the formation of metal–graphene nanocomposites.
3.6. Mechanism of photocatalytic reduction
To understand the mechanism of the photoreduction of the metal ions and the partial reduction of GO, a series of experiments were carried out to probe the production of H2 following the laser irradiation of GO in pure water. Fig. 9 illustrates the experiments performed where the irradiated GO solution was centrifuged to separate the reduced GO and to test the filtrate for the presence of activated H2 that could be adsorbed onto the GO in solution. The addition of Au or Ag ions to the filtrate solution results in the reduction of the metal ions as evident by the appearance of the pink and grey colors and the measured SPR spectra corresponding to Au and Ag nanoparticles, respectively. This suggests the presence of adsorbed H2 which could be activated by GO to act as a reducing agent for the Au and Ag ions. However, if O2 gas is bubbled through the GO filtrate with heating to 80 °C, no reduction of the metal ions is observed. This indicates that in the presence of O2 under heating, most of the adsorbed H2 gas escapes from the solution and no metal reduction is observed. These results are consistent with a recent theoretical study using first-principles computations which suggests that GO can be an ideal substrate for hydrogen storage.60 The calculations suggest that when the oxygen group coverage on GO is low or modest, structural motifs consisting of one –O– and two –OH sites can be exceptionally stable for hydrogen bonding interactions.60

The reduction mechanism of the metal ions (M+) appears to involve photogenerated electrons from GO. In the presence of a reducing environment provided by ethanol or PEG, the holes are scavenged to produce protons and reducing organic radicals. The electrons are used for the reduction of the metal ions, and since the alcohol radicals (˙C2H4OH) are strong reducing agents they undergo oxidation to CH3CHO and therefore reduce GO.39,54,55 A possible mechanism can be summarized as follows: GO + hν → GO (h+ + e−)(1) h+ + C2H5OH → ˙C2H4OH + H+(2) M+ + GO (e−) → GO + M(3) n˙C2H4OH + GO → RGO + nCH3CHO + n/2H2O(4)
In the absence of a reducing environment as in pure water, the mechanism may be summarized as follows: GO + hν → GO (h+ + e−)(5) 4h+ + 2H2O → O2 + 4H+(6) M+ + GO (e−) → GO + M(7) GO + 4e− + 4H+ → RGO + 2H2O(8)
The partial reduction of GO observed in the presence of Au ions suggests that the reduction of the Au ions takes place very rapidly (reaction (7) is more efficient than (8)), and since the resulting Au nanoparticles absorb the 532 nm photons much more efficiently than GO, the photothermal energy conversion by GO is decreased and complete reduction of GO is not possible.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the photocatalytic reduction of gold and silver ions by GO using both laser and tungsten lamp irradiation in different solvent environments. The gold and silver ions are efficiently reduced following the laser or the tungsten lamp irradiation for a few minutes in water–ethanol, water–PEG or pure water solvents. The reduction of GO in the presence of ethanol or PEG is much faster than in pure water under identical experimental conditions. This is attributed to the role of ethanol or PEG in scavenging the holes generated by the irradiation of GO thus leaving the photogenerated electrons to reduce GO. In the absence of a reducing environment as in pure water, partial reduction of GO occurs in the presence of gold ions due to the efficient capturing of the photogenerated electrons in GO by the gold ions and the strong absorption of the 532 nm photons by the newly formed Au nanoparticles.
The present approach leads to the formation of metal nanocrystals dispersed on the reduced or partially reduced GO surfaces without the use of chemical reducing or capping agents which tend to significantly reduce the catalytic activity and poison the nanoparticle catalysts. Strong photothermal effects are observed leading to a significant increase in the temperature of the solution and suggesting that metal–graphene oxide nanocomposites could be promising materials for the efficient conversion of solar energy into usable heat for a variety of thermal, thermochemical and thermomechanical applications.
