, Accepted 11th July 2013First published on 9th August 2013AbstractMost high-performance organic solar cells involve bulk-heterojunctions in order to increase the active donor–acceptor interface area. The power conversion efficiency depends critically on the nano-morphology of the blend and the interface. Spectroscopy of the sub-bandgap region, i.e., below the bulk absorption of the individual components, provides unique opportunities to study interface-related properties. We present absorption measurements in the sub-bandgap region of bulk heterojunctions made of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) as an electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) as an electron acceptor and compare them with quantum-chemical calculations and recently published data on the external quantum efficiency (EQE). The very weak absorption of the deep sub-bandgap region measured by the ultra-sensitive Photothermal Deflection Spectroscopy (PDS) features Urbach tails, polaronic transitions, conventional excitons, and possibly charge-transfer states. The quantum-chemical calculations allow characterizing some of the unsettled spectral features.
Introduction
At present, the best polymer-based bulk-heterojunction solar cells reach more than 8% power-conversion efficiency.1 The performance depends critically on the complex nano-morphology2 and the spatially inhomogeneous donor–acceptor interface.3–5 These are in turn determined by composition and sample processing. Unfortunately, an overall insufficient understanding of many morphology- and interface-related processes hampers further improvement of organic solar cells.6–10 One of the crucial processes is the exciton dissociation, where the roles of different interface-related states such as disorder-related Urbach tail states,7,11 polaron/trion-related12 or intermolecular charge-transfer (CT) states13,14 are controversially debated in the literature. The present work investigates experimentally and theoretically optical properties of bulk-heterojunctions made of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) as an electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) as an electron acceptor, since this is a widely studied model system allowing a high power-conversion efficiency. For this material combination, all the three mentioned states could in principle be probed optically below the individual bandgaps of the pristine materials.7,9,10,15,16 We focus on samples with a P3HT:PCBM composition ratio of 3:2 prepared and annealed under conditions which yield the highest power-conversion efficiency. For comparison, we prepared under the same conditions samples with a 2:3 blending ratio. The latter show inferior power conversion and a quite different nano-morphology, which is characterized by segregation of PCBM,17 which may result in a drastically reduced interface area compared to the 3:2 composition. Spectroscopy of the sub-bandgap region, i.e., below the bulk absorption of the individual components P3HT and PCBM, is arguably the most direct measurement of interface properties. Here, we focus on absorption data as a complement to our recent work on the external quantum efficiency (EQE).7,9,10
Results and discussion
Experimental absorption spectra and energy levels
The very weak absorption of the deep sub-bandgap region is measured via the ultra-sensitive technique of Photothermal Deflection Spectroscopy (PDS).18,19 The PDS spectra were measured using a self-made experimental setup corresponding to that described in ref. 20. PDS-signals where calibrated applying spectroscopic ellipsometry data. The required values of absorption above the band edge and film thickness as well as the absorptivities of the pristine materials can be found in ref. 10.
The PDS-absorption spectra of 3:2- and 2:3-blended P3HT:PCBM bulk-heterojunctions are shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1. A broad approximately linear Urbach background and several approximately Gaussian-shaped peaks are clearly visible in the semi-logarithmic presentation. The second derivative of the PDS-spectrum is shown in the lower panel. This presentation highlights weak, but well defined narrow peaks. In accordance with most of the literature and our own quantum chemical calculations (see below), we assign the peaks around 1.25 eV,21 1.75 eV, and above 1.9 eV to excited polarons, a weak PCBM-transition, and the onset of the inter-chain P3HT absorption,22 respectively. Several possible explanations of the sub-bandgap shoulder between 1.4 and 1.6 eV have been put forward.7,9,10 We note that the relative weight of this feature decreases dramatically when going from a blending ratio of 3:2 to 2:3. Most likely, this reflects the strongly decreased interface area.
 Fig. 1  (upper panel) PDS absorption spectra of P3HT:PCBM bulk-heterojunctions with blending ratios 2:3 (dashed line) and 3:2 (solid line) are shown. (lower panel) The negative second derivative of the PDS absorption spectra emphasizes narrow absorption peaks. 
For a detailed analysis, we present in Fig. 2 fits of the measured sub-bandgap absorption spectra using several Gaussian peaks and a single exponential tail as described in ref. 7, 9 and 10.
 Fig. 2  Fit (solid line) of the sub-bandgap spectrum of P3HT:PCBM films with (a) 3:2 and (b) 2:3 blending ratio measured by PDS (circles) using one exponential and four Gaussians (dotted lines). 
Excellent fits are obtained if the following features are included: (i) an exponential tail which is according to Urbach's rule attributed to disorder;11 (ii) two narrow Gaussians at 2.05 eV and 1.75 eV, which are known as the first singlet transitions of P3HT and PCBM;23–25 (iii) three broad Gaussians at 1.6 eV, 1.25 eV, and 0.9 eV, among which that at 1.25 eV most likely results from the polaronic transition P2 in doped P3HT;21,26 and finally (iv) a very narrow Gaussian at 0.89 eV, which is the notorious OH-absorption of the quartz glass substrate.
Thus, there are two Gaussian peaks in the sub-bandgap region, which are not identified yet: the peak at 0.9 eV reacts to the change of the blending ratio P3HT:PCBM from 3:2 to 2:3 in the very same way as the peak at 1.25 eV; both are reduced equally when lowering P3HT content. This suggests attributing the peak at 0.9 eV to a polaronic transition of the doped P3HT as well. It can be a P1 transition, as in ref. 21 and 26, i.e., an intra-valence band excitation.
Most likely, the peak at 1.6 eV has also been seen by highly sensitive EQE measurements, however at somewhat higher energies of around 1.75 eV.10 This difference does not come as a surprise, because EQE naturally favors the states of the high-energy tail, which in general have lower activation barriers. We recall that this peak, which is clearly seen in the absorption of the 3:2 P3HT:PCBM blend, has negligible weight for the inverse blending ratio 2:3. Therefore, it is most likely related to the interface between P3HT and PCBM, which changes with the blending-ratio-dependent morphology of the film,17 or to other morphology-related changes such as defect and trap density, internal doping, reduced mobility or, e.g., PCBM inclusions in the polymer phase.
Next, we will discuss various possible mechanisms leading to sub-bandgap absorption (SBG), which have been suggested in the literature and are illustrated in Fig. 3: (panel a) disorder: static and dynamic local variations of the energy gap between the highest occupied (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are generally believed to lead to an approximately exponential sub-bandgap density of states, which are often subsumed under the broad unspecific label “Urbach tails”. These are clearly present in the PDS spectrum (see Fig. 2) as well as in the EQE spectrum.7,9,10
 Fig. 3  Illustration of several contributions to sub-bandgap absorption (SBG), following ref. 10. (a) Disorder: local variations of the energies of the highest occupied (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) lead to transitions (black arrow) at energies below the gap of the fictitious disorder-free reference material (gray arrow). (b) Molecularly dispersed PCBM: orbital energies of PCBM molecules in a P3HT-rich phase are influenced by the surrounding matrix. (c) Intermolecular charge-transfer transitions are expected to exist at the interface. (d) Polaron-related transitions: uncompensated charges, e.g., hole polarons in the polymer will induce transitions within the manifold of valence states (P1) and will via the Coulomb attraction locally reduce the HOMO–LUMO gap (P2) and modify similar transitions involving other states such as more delocalized holes (P3 or DP2). 
(panel b) Molecularly dispersed PCBM: the energy levels of isolated PCBM molecules and small PCBM clusters in a P3HT matrix – most likely in the disordered regions near the interface – will be shifted relative to levels of PCBM in a PCMB-rich phase. Thus optical transitions will be inhomogeneously broadened with an approximately Gaussian shape. In this model, the blending ratio dependence of the sub-bandgap absorption around 1.6 eV may be explained by the segregation of the PCBM for high concentrations, reducing the amount of dispersed PCBM mentioned above.17 Though the magnitude of the disorder-induced broadening of the dispersed PCBM absorption compared to the bulk PCBM absorption at 1.75 eV is reasonable, a red-shift by almost 200 meV seems highly unlikely. Therefore, we will henceforth ignore this mechanism as a possible origin of the sub-bandgap absorption around 1.6 eV. Of course, the dispersion of PCBM into the P3HT matrix is quite important for the disorder in general (see above) as well as the charge-transfer process (see below) – on the one hand by increasing the heterojunction interface for charge-carrier generation and on the other hand by reducing the quantum efficiency as possible centers for charge-carrier recombination.
(panel c) Intermolecular charge-transfer transitions: the charge transfer across the interface initiates the final charge separation. Therefore, it is an absolutely essential step for the operation of bulk-heterojunctions solar cells. Less is known about the role and properties of charge-transfer excitons, i.e., bound electron–hole pairs with one particle being in one material and the other being in the other material. Being spatially indirect, charge-transfer transitions have low oscillator strength. Obviously, the transition energy is lower than for the individual materials.
(panel d) Polaron-related transitions: ideally, electrons and holes move after charge separation towards the respective electrodes. This leads to a non-vanishing charge-carrier concentration in particular in the material with lower mobility, i.e., in the polymer. Of course, these holes form polarons. Unintentional doping by, e.g., defects increases the hole–polaron concentration further. The presence of polarons modifies the absorption spectrum and leads to at least three new features. So-called P1 transitions26 transfer the hole from the highest occupied molecular orbital to a level of lower electron energy, i.e. higher hole energy. The conventional HOMO–LUMO transition is red-shifted in the neighborhood of a charged particle for the same reason why H− and H2+ ions exist: the neutral H atom corresponds to an exciton, where the proton acts as a super heavy hole. The third particle gains energy by avoiding the particle of same charge and by being close to the particle of opposite charge. Optical transitions involving such three-particle states, so-called trions, have been studied extensively in inorganic semiconductors,27 but are well documented for organic materials as well.12 The conceptually simplest case is the so-called P2 transition, where absorption generates a hole in the HOMO of the same molecule where the hole polaron sits. Slightly higher transition energies are expected if the photo-generated hole occupies a different valence orbital or if the resulting polaronic trion as a whole and the involved hole states in particular are more delocalized. These transitions have been named P326 and DP221 transitions, stressing the one or the other case. For real, non-perfectly ordered polymers with finite spectroscopic units,28–30 these two concepts are limiting cases of a continuous range of intermediate cases. This will be emphasized by referring to them as polaron-related P3/DP2 transitions, henceforth.
Fig. 4 summarizes what is known or generally assumed about the term scheme of the P3HT–PCBM heterojunction. The energy values indicate the range of typical values published in the literature. Of course, though often used, this scheme is not consistent since it mixes the molecular orbital with transition energies ignoring that to the latter not only HOMO–LUMO configurations contribute. Furthermore, in conjugated polymers as well as fullerenes the exciton binding energy is so high that the optical bandgap given by the onset of absorption is much smaller than the electronic bandgap defined as the difference of the respective HOMO and LUMO energies. Nevertheless, the most fundamental quantity for any discussion of energies of charge-transfer transitions is the difference of the HOMO of P3HT and the LUMO of PCBM. Unfortunately, its determination is difficult due to the numerous and partially contradicting values for the energetic positions of the respective molecular states of P3HT and PCBM. A further complication results from the fact that the fullerenes used in solar cells are modified by functional groups to increase their solubility. The side groups break the icosahedral symmetry for C60, dark C60 states obtain finite oscillator strength in the less symmetric environment and the onset of the PCBM transition gets blurred. The reported energies of the P3HT-HOMO varies from −4.6 eV to −5.1 eV and those of the PCBM-LUMO from −3.7 eV to −4.3 eV.23,31–33 This already results in a variation of the molecular orbital energy gap of the combined P3HT–PCBM system, i.e., the HOMO → LUMO transition excluding the exciton binding energy, of 0.3 eV to 1.3 eV. Of course, the most extreme values are highly unlikely, but they illustrate the difficulty of finding even the correct range of transition energies for the charge-transfer exciton. Faist et al. reported a charge-transfer energy of 0.89 ± 0.03 eV.32 They used the definition by Tvingstedt et al.13 based on electroluminescence, which may provide a lower bound for the energy of charge-transfer transition in absorption. Note that due to the polaron formation in conjugated polymers, the Stokes shift between electroluminescence and absorption is expected to be quite large. An upper bound for the lowest charge-transfer state is given by the onset of the PCBM absorption at 1.75 eV.25 If the energy of the PCBM absorption were lower than the energy of the charge-transfer state, the former would represent an excellent recombination channel in the P3HT–PCBM blend. Of course, this would be in sharp contradiction to the fact that the P3HT–PCBM blends yield efficient solar cells. The scheme of the P3HT–PCBM heterojunction shown in Fig. 4 is further based on reported values for the energy of the P3HT-LUMO, which varies from 2.9 eV to 3.0 eV,23 and a tentative value for the experimentally undetermined PCBM-HOMO energy of −6.0 eV to −6.5 eV.31 The onset energies of the optical transition in the parent compounds are 2.0–2.1 eV for P3HT absorption23–25 and 1.75 eV for PCBM absorption.25 Note that, as mentioned above, the optical transition energy is reduced by the exciton binding energy and, therefore, smaller than the energy difference between LUMO and HOMO, i.e., the electronic bandgap. We have also included in the sketch two charge-transfer transitions: the peak of electroluminescence at 0.89 eV (see above) and a peak at 1.75 eV found in our EQE measurements.7 Finally, we indicate two polaronic transitions, i.e., excited states for cationic P3HT+: the P1 transition at about 0.5 eV, representing an intra-band transition of the hole, and the P2 transition at 1.25 eV usually attributed to a trion, i.e., an additional exciton in the presence of a hole. Both transitions are found in photo-induced, doping-induced, and electro absorption.21,34,35 Polaron transitions involving excited and/or delocalized holes (P3/DP2) have energies above P2. A rough estimate of their energy is given by the formula E(P3) = E(P1) + E(P2). These numbers confirm that such excited polaron-related transitions are good candidates for the peak in question at 1.6 eV in PDS and near 1.75 eV in EQE.7,10
 Fig. 4  Term scheme of the P3HT–PCBM heterojunction with typical energies discussed in the literature. Shown are the energy levels of HOMOs and LUMOs of P3HT and PCBM, the relevant transition energies found in absorption (Abs), external quantum efficiency spectra (EQE), electroluminescence (EL), photo-induced absorption (PIA). The arrows marked with eT and hT indicate the radiation-less electron and hole transfer after intra-molecular excitation of P3HT or PCBM, respectively. On the left side, the scheme of transitions for the cationic P3HT+ is shown. In lack of further information, its HOMO level is arbitrarily aligned with that of the neutral species. The initial and final states of the charge transfer found in EQE are unclear. 
Quantum-chemical calculations
For a more detailed understanding of the crucial role of molecular interface states in the polymer–fullerene heterojunction, we have quantum-chemically calculated the electronic transitions of the absorption spectrum of an oligothiophene:C60 model system, which can be considered as a simplified version of the P3HT:PCBM system. For the oligothiophene, we have taken an undeci-thiophene without any side-chains. The length of 11 monomers has been chosen, since it corresponds approximately to the conjugation length and the spectroscopic units in a disordered conjugated polymer28,30 though the concept of spectroscopic units by itself is questionable.29 In view of the neglected side-group and substituent approximation, the chosen configuration appears to be the most important one as it accounts for the interaction of the thiophene and the C60 π-systems. Of course, the functionalizations of the real molecules, rather indirectly influencing electronic properties by changing solubility and morphology than having a direct influence on electronic properties, would cause a variety of different mutual orientations between thiophene and C60 which would broaden spectral features or yield new spectral contributions supposed to be minor.
For the DFT36 and TD-DFT37 calculations we used the program package Gaussian09™38 utilizing the hybrid functional B3LYP39 and the Gaussian basis set 6-31G**.40 This functional still represents the best choice for systems where both π–π* transitions and charge transfer states are to be calculated. Our alternative TD-DFT calculations with the range-corrected functionals CAM-B3LYP and ωB97X resulted in much too high optical bandgaps, i.e. π–π* transition energies, of about 2.5 eV for the isolated undeci-thiophene and a very strange oscillator strength distribution with one CT-state possessing approximately the same strength as the π–π* transition. The individual transitions are characterized by the corresponding charge difference density δρ(r), i.e., the difference between the charge density of the respective excited state and the ground state, and visualized as isosurfaces using GaussView5.0™.41 Within single-particle theory, the charge difference density is simply given by the difference between the holes and the excited electron ρh(r) − ρe(r). This method has proven its adequacy for intra-molecular charge transfer in conjugated polymers,42,43 conjugated copolymers,44,45 and polymer–fullerene dyads.46,47 Common reservations concerning TD-DFT calculations with the B3-LYP functional for charge transfer states may be dispelled by the fact that the electron density of the system is not really bipartite due to some overlap between molecular orbitals of the C60 and the closest thiophene ring of the oligothiophene.
The DFT geometry optimization using the B3-LYP functional and the 6-31G** basis set (see Fig. 5) results in a shortest distance between a C60 carbon and the central thiophene sulfur atom of 2.623 Å. The oligothiophene structure is slightly distorted and the C60 molecule is very slightly deformed, even though a dispersion interaction has not been explicitly included. We restrict ourselves to this model system, because, unfortunately, it was not possible to calculate the experimentally given P3HT–PCBM configuration. It turned out to be unstable without van-der-Waals interaction of the P3HT side-chains and the PCBM side-group. Consideration of the van-der-Waals interaction in the optimization by applying the Grimme correction48 in the ωB97X-D functional49 results in a stronger attraction between the thiophene-rings and the C60. Consequently, the oligothiophene coils around the C60 ball (see Fig. 6). In principle this is a possible configuration. However, with 1.5 eV the bandgap calculated by TD-DFT using the functional B3-LYP on the basis of this geometry is far away from any experimental data. Such low bandgaps are known artifacts for unphysically strong azimuthal bends in an oligothiophene chain.29 Therefore, we may assume that the functional ωB97X-D overestimates the effect of the van-der-Waals interaction between oligothiophenes and C60 in this peculiar case. The reason for this calculation artifact may be an insufficient damping function in the Grimme correction.50 Thus there was no better functional we could use for the calculation of the oligothiophene:C60 model system than B3LYP.

The TD-DFT calculations of the isolated undeci-thiophene with the same geometry as in the dimer have resulted in absorption spectra with one major transition at 2.04 eV with an oscillator strength of 3.7 a.u., which represents the π–π* transition of an oligothiophene. This assignment is confirmed by the charge difference density (see Fig. 7), which features the typical “excitonic pattern” of hole contributions over the position of the ground state double bonds and contributions from the excited electron over the conjugating single bonds. We may identify this transition with the optical bandgap of a polythiophene.42 A calculation of the isolated C60 shows several transitions above 2.83 eV, whose oscillator strengths vanish for symmetry reasons as expected.

Since the TD-DFT calculations of the isolated C60 and oligothiophene yield no transitions at energies below the dominant π–π* transition of the oligothiophene at 2.04 eV, which is identified as S8 not only by the identical transition energy and comparable oscillator strengths but also by comparing the charge difference densities (see Fig. 7 and S8 in Table 1), all transitions in the sub-bandgap region have to be interface-related states. The most prominent sub-bandgap transition is found at 1.42 eV. Its oscillator strength of 0.05 a.u. is weak compared to the oscillator strength of 3.3 a.u. of the π–π* transition. Its transition energy fits very well to the charge-transfer excitation shown in the above scheme (see Fig. 4). The corresponding charge difference density (see Table 1 S3) confirms this assignment by showing the electron on the C60 and the hole on the oligothiophene. Notably there are two more transitions of similar charge-transfer character at 1.40 eV without any relevant oscillator strengths. That these three transitions are close in energy, results from the threefold degeneracy of the C60 LUMO, whose symmetry is broken by the presence of the oligothiophene. Between this group of transitions and the bandgap, we find five more transitions: at 1.70 eV, 1.71 eV, 1.73 eV, 1.98 eV, and 2.00 eV. Among them, the one at 1.73 eV with 0.005 a.u. oscillator strength is that of highest interest. The transition energy fits quite well to the absorption band found in the PDS spectrum and even better to that in the EQE spectrum.10 The charge difference density (see Table 1 S6) reveals several features: (i) charge-transfer character, since the excited electron and the generated hole sit predominantly on the fullerene and the oligomer, respectively. (ii) The hole density exhibits a node at the central thiophene. Viewed as a single-particle state, this indicates that the respective hole occupies an excited state, most likely HOMO-1. (iii) The electron–hole distribution on the central thiophene shows some of the alternating pattern which is typical for π–π* transitions as shown in Table 1 S8 and discussed above. Notably, this transition is dominated (40%) by the contribution of the HOMO − 1 → LUMO + 2 transition. The weaker transitions at 1.70 eV and 1.71 eV are analogs to the transition at 1.73 eV, but with the dominant transitions being HOMO − 1 → LUMO and LUMO + 1, respectively. Again the grouping of these three states originates from the threefold-degenerate LUMO of the isolated C60. This group of transitions near 1.7 eV can be considered as “the first overtone with respect to the envelope function of the hole” of the group of charge-transfer transitions at 1.40 eV. In this picture, the energy difference of both groups is dominated by the confinement energy of the hole along the oligomer. One can expect that in the limit of very long, well ordered oligomers these transitions form a charge-transfer band reaching from below 1.40 eV to above 1.75 eV. Even if one accounts for the effective hole confinement by disorder in real polymers, the result would be a broad band of charge-transfer states centered near 1.6 eV. This points to CT excitons as an equally good candidate for the origin of the peak in question at 1.6 eV in PDS as polaron-related transitions. Unfortunately, a quantum-chemical determination of trions, i.e., charged excitons, would involve multi-reference configuration interaction calculations for large charged systems, which is a frightening task.

We conclude that even our highly sensitive absorption measurements combined with our quantum chemical calculations do not allow a final answer to the question whether CT transitions or polaron-related transitions are the main reason for the peak at 1.6 eV. Strong support for the second possibility comes from our recent study of the temperature-dependence of the EQE spectra. We observe that the sub-bandgap EQE(T) drops fast above room temperature.10 This is difficult to reconcile with thermally stable CT-excitons. Since the CT-exciton binding energy of the P3HT–PCBM system is not known, we take the value of 130 meV for PPV–PCBM bulk-heterojunctions51,52 as an indication for the order of magnitude and thus as an indication for thermal stability. In contrast, it is very plausible that charged excitons experience a strongly temperature-dependent phonon scattering, which reduces mobility and EQE. Furthermore, the temperature-dependence of the sub-bandgap resembles that of the P3HT-related above-bandgap EQE.9,10 Returning to the quantum-chemical calculations, we remark that the observation (iii) of some mixture between the inter-molecular charge-transfer state and an intra-molecular π–π* exciton on the polymer is – in retrospect – not so surprising. It is a natural consequence of the interaction between the LUMO states of both materials occurring if the distance between the molecules is in the range of a few Ångströms and, consequently, the overlap between the molecular orbitals is significant. Finally, we found two sub-bandgap transitions at 1.98 eV and 2.00 eV, which together with a transition at 2.04 eV just above the oligothiophene π–π* transition may be identified as fullerene excitons (electron–hole alternation on the C60 in the charge difference density in Table 1 S7) with a small charge-transfer component (hole density on the polythiophene). The latter is concentrated on the central thiophene ring, i.e., close to the C60, and to a minor degree at the ends of the oligothiophene chain, as expected from free charges on a conducting rod.
Summary and conclusions
Spectroscopy of the sub-bandgap region, i.e., below the bulk absorption of the individual components, provides unique opportunities to measure interface-related properties and to learn more about the influence of the nano-morphology of the blend and the interface on device properties. We used photothermal deflection spectroscopy for very detailed measurements of the absorption in the sub-bandgap region of two bulk-heterojunction P3HT:PCBM samples which are typical for polymer-based solar cells. The spectra can be modeled quantitatively as superposition of several contributions which have been suggested in the literature. Quantum-chemical calculations allowed us to establish their origin in most cases. These calculations and further results published by other groups13,14 suggest that the charge-transfer exciton, which may play a crucial role in the charge separation in actual solar cells, and polaron-related transitions corresponding to trions occur at similar energies, i.e., near 1.6 eV.12 Most likely, both mechanisms contribute. Their disentanglement and, more generally, the quantum-chemical description of polaron- and trion-related transitions, remain challenges for the future. Of course, both processes are related to the dispersion of PCBM into the P3HT matrix increasing the heterojunction interface, the optimization of which is the subject of numerous morphology studies.2
The physics of the calculated charge-transfer states is richer than we expected, since charge-transfer excitons can be made of different, more or less delocalized hole (and electron) orbitals. Furthermore, electron and hole states on either side of the interface will interact, leading to an admixture of “conventional” excitons to charge-transfer excitons and vice versa. Since this depends on the conformation of the polythiophene chain and its position relative to the fullerenes – both of which vary for the amorphous micro-morphology of the bulk heterojunction, as the large broadening of the experimental subbandgap absorption bands already indicates – the model system used for our calculations is only a snapshot. This, however, reproduces the physics behind the experimental data, in particular the sub-bandgap EQE spectrum7 in comparison to the PDS spectra, astonishingly well.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (upper panel) PDS absorption spectra of P3HT:PCBM bulk-heterojunctions with blending ratios 2:3 (dashed line) and 3:2 (solid line) are shown. (lower panel) The negative second derivative of the PDS absorption spectra emphasizes narrow absorption peaks.	 

 	Fig. 2  Fit (solid line) of the sub-bandgap spectrum of P3HT:PCBM films with (a) 3:2 and (b) 2:3 blending ratio measured by PDS (circles) using one exponential and four Gaussians (dotted lines).	 

 	Fig. 3  Illustration of several contributions to sub-bandgap absorption (SBG), following ref. 10. (a) Disorder: local variations of the energies of the highest occupied (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) lead to transitions (black arrow) at energies below the gap of the fictitious disorder-free reference material (gray arrow). (b) Molecularly dispersed PCBM: orbital energies of PCBM molecules in a P3HT-rich phase are influenced by the surrounding matrix. (c) Intermolecular charge-transfer transitions are expected to exist at the interface. (d) Polaron-related transitions: uncompensated charges, e.g., hole polarons in the polymer will induce transitions within the manifold of valence states (P1) and will via the Coulomb attraction locally reduce the HOMO–LUMO gap (P2) and modify similar transitions involving other states such as more delocalized holes (P3 or DP2).	 

 	Fig. 4  Term scheme of the P3HT–PCBM heterojunction with typical energies discussed in the literature. Shown are the energy levels of HOMOs and LUMOs of P3HT and PCBM, the relevant transition energies found in absorption (Abs), external quantum efficiency spectra (EQE), electroluminescence (EL), photo-induced absorption (PIA). The arrows marked with eT and hT indicate the radiation-less electron and hole transfer after intra-molecular excitation of P3HT or PCBM, respectively. On the left side, the scheme of transitions for the cationic P3HT+ is shown. In lack of further information, its HOMO level is arbitrarily aligned with that of the neutral species. The initial and final states of the charge transfer found in EQE are unclear.	 

 	Fig. 5  Structure of the undeci-thiophene – C60 dimer as optimized by using DFT with the B3-LYP functional and the 6-31G** basis set.	 

 	Fig. 6  Structure of the undeci-thiophene – C60 dimer as optimized by using DFT with the ωB97X-D functional (including Grimme correction) for considering Van-der-Waals interaction.	 

 	Fig. 7  Isosurface of the charge difference density (blue = electron, red = hole) for the lowest singlet transition S1 with transition energy 2.04 eV (λ = 606.58 nm) and oscillator strength of 3.7 a.u. as calculated by TD-DFT using the B3-LYP functional and the 6-31G** basis set for the isolated undeci-thiophene with the same geometry as in the structure-optimized dimer.
