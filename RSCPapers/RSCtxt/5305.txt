    , Accepted 24th February 2023First published on 24th February 2023AbstractThermal harvesting and storage using phase change materials (PCMs) plays a critical role in thermal management and solar energy utilization. However, the intrinsically low thermal conductivity, solid–liquid leakage, and poor solar-thermoelectric conversion capacity are significant challenges for applications of PCMs in these fields. Herein, we report a green, robust, and versatile carboxymethyl cellulose/boron nitride nanosheet unidirectional aerogel (CBNA) with extraordinary mechanical properties to encapsulate lauric acid (LA). The obtained LA@CBNA composite PCM (CPCM) exhibits an ultrahigh latent heat of 190.4 J g−1, which is up to 98.1% that of LA. Compared with LA, the thermal conductivity of LA@CBNA is significantly increased from 0.2011 to 1.1425 W m−1 K−1. The preeminent thermophysical properties endow this CPCM with an extraordinary thermal management performance in electronic devices. The thermal management tests show that the temperature of a working chip can be reduced by 36.1 °C at 2.5 W. The addition of a small trace of graphene (10% of boron nitride nanosheets) can endow the CPCM with an excellent solar-thermal conversion efficiency of 88.89%, while the thermal conductivity is further improved to 1.2856 W m−1 K−1. Meanwhile, a solar-thermal energy conversion and storage system integrated with a thermoelectric generator can achieve 54.56% solar-thermoelectric conversion efficiency.
Introduction
As the age of multiple intelligences blossoms, electronic devices that integrate various intelligent function units in a limited space have attracted great attention due to their integrative and intelligent functions, such as energy harvesting,1,2 health management,3 and body monitoring.4 However, the integration of intelligent functions is usually accompanied by high power densification, which may bring significant heat accumulation during operations because of limited heat conductivity in narrow spaces.5 Furthermore, undesired thermal accumulation may deteriorate the service performance and cause operator discomfort or even skin injury.6 Currently, thermal conduction and heat flux manipulation are the two main strategies that have been proposed to modulate temperatures and reduce heat buildup in electronic devices.7 Thermal conduction technology relies on metal heat sinks or high-thermal-conductivity materials to dissipate the generated heat from one area to another.8 However, heat that does not disappear can still lead to thermal runaway and harm operators. These problems can be avoided by heat flux manipulation strategies using phase change materials (PCMs).9 They can absorb a significant amount of heat at a nearly constant temperature during the phase change process, which gives them great application potential in the field of thermal management of electronic devices.10 Although PCMs can effectively maintain the operating temperature of electronics within a suitable range, the liquid phase generated during the phase transition process leads to leakage problems.11,12 Besides, the poor thermal conductivity severely undermines the thermal collection capacity.13 Researchers have carried out a lot of work to solve the above two problems of PCMs. Mishra et al.14 prepared a lauric acid/carbon black nanopowder based CPCM with preeminent shape stabilities, and the thermal conductivity of the CPCM was enhanced by ∼195% when loaded with 3.5 wt% of nano-inclusions. Jia et al.15 constructed BN@CS scaffolds via the ice-templated self-strategy to encapsulate PCMs, which exhibit excellent shape stabilities and a high thermal conductivity of up to 2.77 W m−1 K−1.
On the other hand, PCMs are an important energy storage medium due to their high latent heat capacity.16 To alleviate the energy crisis and emerging environmental warming concerns caused by the overuse of fossil fuels, it is necessary to exploit latent heat energy storage techniques to effectively harvest and utilize green, sustainable, and inexhaustible renewable solar energy as the insolation on earth in one hour is far more than the energy consumed by humans in an entire year.17–19 To date, the mainstream technologies to utilize solar energy and alleviate the energy crisis are photovoltaics and thermoelectric power generation. Photovoltaic power generators can directly convert sunlight into electricity based on the fundamentals of electron–hole pair generation,20,21 while thermoelectric power generators use temperature differences to convert thermal energy into electric potential based on the Seebeck effect.22–24 However, the actual power generation performance varies dramatically with temporal and spatial distributions, and the power generation is intermittent and fluctuating.25 In addition, these technologies also suffer from a low power generation efficiency because they can only use a limited wavelength band of solar radiation.26 Of note, integrating solar thermoelectric generators with PCMs rather than directly applying incident solar irradiation to the thermoelectric device offers a more advantageous way to enhance the utilization of solar energy.27 This is attributed to their ultrahigh energy density and durable energy generation, regardless of the actual solar radiation flux, which varies with time, weather, and region. Nevertheless, current PCM-based solar-thermal-electric conversion technologies still suffer from low power density output, which is impeded by poor sunlight absorption capacity and the intrinsic low thermal conductivity of pristine PCMs.28,29 Therefore, it is of great importance to develop a green, robust and versatile platform to shape solid–liquid PCMs and endow them with efficient thermal energy storage, temperature regulation of electronic devices, and solar-thermoelectric conversion.
Aerogels are typical low-density bulk materials with 3D network skeletons and hierarchical pores at micro, meso, and macro scales.30 Their skeletal and multistage pore structure contributes to several extraordinary physical properties, such as an ultra-low density, large porosity, high specific area, and outstanding adsorption performance.31–33 These properties make aerogels an ideal candidate for a broad range of functional applications, such as energy conversion and storage, thermal management of electronic devices and buildings, catalysis, and aerospace.34–37 Heretofore, graphene aerogels have attracted extensive attention as efficient host matrices to encapsulate PCMs with ultrahigh latent heat capacity, enhanced thermal conductivity, and prominent sunlight/electric-thermal conversion.38–41 However, the production of such aerogels at manufacturing scales is still a challenge. The most frequently used strategies include chemical vapor deposition,42 Hummers' method,43 hydrothermal methods,44 and templating,45 which are often laborious and involve expensive precursors, complex devices, or hazardous waste emissions. Additionally, CPCMs based on graphene cannot be directly applied for thermal management of electronic devices as their high electrical conductivity may short circuit devices. Boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) exfoliated from hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), are a kind of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial analogous to graphene.46,47 Up to now, BNNSs have become an ideal candidate to prepare high-performance thermal management materials for electronics due to their inherent ultrahigh thermal conductivity, superior electrical insulation, outstanding thermal and chemical stability, and robust mechanical strength.48,49 However, their lack of functional groups on the surface and the weak interactions between BNNSs make it difficult to fabricate aerogels or scaffolds using self-assembly methods.50
Herein, we report a green but facile strategy to fabricate a lightweight, robust and highly oriented BNNS aerogel through unidirectional freeze-drying. Of note, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), which has abundant hydroxyl groups and is easily soluble in water, was used as a binder to assemble the BNNSs, and the unidirectional freeze-drying methodology was applied to promote the orientation of CMC/BNNS as driven by the directional growth of ice crystals (Fig. 1). The highly oriented CMC/BNNS aerogel (CBNA) can be directly prepared into various complex shapes with extraordinary mechanical and insulative properties. We ascribe these advantages to the brick-concrete structure of CBNA, in which CMC fibers serve as the concrete and the embedded BNNSs act as bricks. The unidirectional CBNA with an anisotropic structure endows the obtained aerogel with outstanding mechanical and thermal properties. The strong hydrogen bond between CMC and hydroxylated BNNSs endows the aerogel with a robust compressive strength of 0.9947 MPa. Furthermore, the novel CBNA host matrix encapsulated lauric acid (LA) to fabricate a LA@CBNA composite PCM (CPCM). The meso–macroporous confinement structure of the aerogel and the construction of a highly oriented 3D network contribute to the CPCM having an ultrahigh latent heat that is 98.1% that of LA, and a significantly enhanced thermal conductivity of 0.2011 W m−1 K−1 for LA to 1.1425 W m−1 K−1 for LA@CBNA, which is a 5.68 fold improvement. This novel CPCM presents efficient thermal management capabilities by lowering the working temperature of a chip by more than 36 °C, which is attributed to its simultaneously having a high latent heat, outstanding thermal conductivity, and strong shape stability. The introduction of a small trace of graphene into CBNA provides LA@CBNA with a preeminent solar-thermoelectric conversion performance that originates from its newly obtained solar-thermal conversion while further improving the thermal conductivity. The obtained CPCM-10 exhibits a high solar-thermal efficiency of 88.89% and solar-thermoelectric efficiency of 64.41%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a unidirectional hybrid BNNS aerogel based on CPCMs prepared through a green and facile method that exhibits ultrahigh latent heat, thermal conductivity, electrical insulation, robust shape stability, preeminent thermal management, and solar-thermoelectric efficiency. This novel LA@CBNA has broad application potential in many fields, such as thermal recovery, thermal management of electrical devices, and solar energy conversion and utilization.

Experimental section
Materials
h-BN with a lateral size of 1–2 μm and CMC were purchased from Macklin Co., Ltd., China. Isopropanol (IPA) was bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China. LA was supplied by Shanghai Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd., China, and graphene was purchased from Nanjing Xianfeng Nano Materials Technology Co., Ltd., China.
Preparation of BNNSs, CBNA, and LA@CBNA
The BNNSs were prepared through sonication-assisted liquid phase exfoliation. First, 5 g of h-BN powder and 100 mL of 1 M NaOH solution were mixed and magnetically stirred for 12 h at 120 °C. Next, 2 g of modified BN and 100 mL of a mixed solution of IPA and water were placed into a flask and agitated at 600 rpm for 24 h assisted by ultrasound. The resultant suspension was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min, the dispersion was then centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 15 min, and the product was further washed with water several times to obtain purified BNNSs, and the yield of BNNSs was 4.8%.
The CBNA was fabricated based on the unidirectional freeze-drying method. Typically, a certain BNNS dispersion volume and CMC aqueous solution were mixed and intensely stirred for 12 h to obtain a homogeneous solution. The mixture was then poured into a silicone rubber mold with a specific shape and was frozen by adding liquid nitrogen. The frozen block was further freeze-dried for 48 h. The aerogels obtained by varying the CMC/BNNS weight ratios over 5/5, 4/6, 3/7, and 2/8 are denoted as CBNA-55, CBNA-46, CBNA-37, and CBNA-28, respectively.
LA@CBNA was prepared using a simple melting impregnation technique. In brief, LA was heated to 60 °C for melting, and the aerogels were placed into the molten LA. LA quickly adsorbed and diffused into the pores of the aerogel once it came into contact with the CBNA. Then, the obtained LA@CBNA was placed on filter paper at 60 °C overnight to remove residual LA from the aerogel surface. Moreover, a small trace of graphene was substituted (0, 5, 10, and 15 wt% of the BNNSs) to endow CBNA with a solar-thermal conversion capacity and further improve the thermal conductivity. The obtained CPCMs are correspondingly called CPCM-0, CPCM-5, CPCM-10, and CPCM-15.
Characterization
The morphologies of samples were observed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Ultra Plus-43-13, Zeiss, Germany) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, Joel, Japan). The thickness of BNNS layers was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Nanoscope IV, Veeco, USA). The chemical structure and compatibility of components were investigated by Fourier transformation infrared spectrometry (FTIR, Nicolet 6700, Thermo Scientific, USA) over the wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm−1. The crystallization behavior was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation in the range of 5–70°. The compression stress–strain curves of CBNAs were recorded using a dynamic mechanical analyzer (Q800, TA Instruments, USA). The thermal stability was studied using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TG, STA2500, Netzsch, Germany). The thermal conductivities of samples were measured using a thermal constant analyzer (TPS2500S, Hot Disk, Sweden). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Pyris 1, PerkinElmer, USA) was used to investigate the phase change properties and thermal storage capabilities of samples. The uncertainties in the temperature and latent heat measurements were ±0.025 °C and ±0.04%, respectively. The measurements were carried out between 0 and 100 °C with a heating and cooling rate of 5 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The thermal reliability was tested in a programmable constant temperature and humidity chamber (FH-80R, Dongguan City Development Environment Test Equipment Co. Ltd., China). Electrical conductivity measurements were performed through a 4-point probe setup (RTS-9, 4 PROBES TECH, China) with an uncertainty of ±0.3%. The light absorption properties were examined by ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectroscopy (UV-Vis-NIR, Lambda 750S, PerkinElmer, USA). The solar-thermal conversion performance was studied using a xenon lamp (Sun 2000 Solar Simulator, Abet Technologies, USA) as simulated sunlight. The temperature of samples was monitored in real-time using a thermocouple (SSN-11E, Yuwen, China) with an uncertainty of ±0.5 °C. A thermographic camera (Tis20, Fluke Corporation, USA) was used to record the transient temperature changes of the samples under solar irradiation. The output voltage and current of the solar-thermoelectric conversion system were detected on a multimeter (Victor 8245, Victor, China) with uncertainties of ±0.05% and 0.35%.
Results and discussion
Nanosheet preparation and assembly
The macro-/micro-morphologies and structures of the samples are shown in Fig. 2. The original h-BN powder is composed of several random stacks of BN pieces with different sizes and thicknesses and was exfoliated into small and thin nanosheets after sonication for 24 h with the assistance of IPA (Fig. 2a and b). The TEM image in Fig. 2c shows that the prepared BNNSs are light in color with a transparent sheet-like structure, indicating their ultrathin features. The BNNS thickness was evaluated using AFM, as shown in Fig. 2d and e. The BNNSs have a thickness of less than 3 nm, which means that the nanosheets consist of several atomic layers as a BN monolayer is 0.4–0.5 nm.51 The obtained BNNS suspension can maintain good stability for several days, and thus will not settle down during freeze-drying. Furthermore, the structure evolution was analyzed by XRD and FTIR. As shown in Fig. 2f, the h-BN powder and BNNS display two adsorption bands at 1388 and 799 cm−1, corresponding to the in-plane B–N stretching band and out-of-plane bending band.52 The exfoliated BNNS shows a characteristic absorption peak corresponding to –OH at 3445 cm−1,53 which is significantly stronger than that of BN. This indicates that several hydroxyls were generated for BNNSs after ultrasonic exfoliation in solution. The boron–nitrogen bonds near defect sites may be prone to attack from oxygen atoms of water molecules with the help of IPA.54 The defect further propagates when adjacent borazine units are hydrolyzed until reaching the edges. Therefore, the hydroxyls between CMC and the BNNS can easily form strong hydrogen bonding interactions in aqueous solution. The XRD pattern shown in Fig. 2g indicates that both h-BN and the BNNS possess diffraction peaks at 26.77°, 41.60°, and 55.13°, corresponding to the (002), (100), and (004) planes. The intensity ratio between the (100) and (004) planes (I100/I004) of the BNNS is significantly smaller than that of BN,55 which could be attributed to the enhanced exposure of the (002) basal plane because of the successful peeling-off of few BNNS layers from BN along the (002) plane.56

The prepared BNNS was assembled into an aerogel using a simple unidirectional freeze-drying method,57 where there was only a single bottom-up temperature gradient. The obtained BNNS can be well dispersed in CMC solution, which could be attributed to the large viscosity of the solution and the strong hydrogen bond interaction between CMC and the BNNS. During this process, ice crystals grow unidirectionally along the temperature gradient and exclude the CMC/BNNS from the freezing front to form cross-linked cell walls. After the sublimation of ice crystals under the freeze-drying treatment, the obtained CBNA displays perfect cellular structures with tubular pores parallel to the freezing direction. The cross-sectional SEM image in the longitudinal plane shows honeycomb-like pores sized at 100 μm while exhibiting a parallel arrangement in the transverse plane (Fig. 2h and i). Zooming in on the cellular skeleton shows a dense embedding of the BNNSs in the CMC matrix (Fig. 2j), which indicates strong interfacial interactions between the CMC and BNNSs. The highly oriented catheter and “brick-concrete structure” in the CBNA effectively facilitate the PCM impregnation and heat conduction, which enhances the compression stress.
Benefiting from the low shrinkage rate and good structural formability, the CBNA can be prepared with a controllable density by adjusting the solution concentration and designed into any desirable shape using different molds, as shown in Fig. 2k. The as-synthesized CBNA stands freely on a Setaria due to its ultralow density. It is noted that a 0.27 g CBNA-28 cylinder with ϕ 2.1 cm could retain its original shape without deformation when pressed with a 149 g steel cake, where the applied pressure reaches as high as 0.43 MPa (Fig. 2l). This indicates that CBNA exhibits a robust mechanical strength along the pressure direction. The mechanical properties of CBNA were further studied by compression tests, as illustrated in Fig. 2m and n. The compressive stresses improve with an increased CMC/BNNS weight ratio. The maximum compressive stress at an 80% strain increases from 0.234 MPa for CBNA-55 to 0.995 MPa for CBNA-28, which is much higher than sponges,58 foams,59 and aerogels60 in other reports. The typical unidirectional cellular structure of CMC and cooperative reinforcement of BNNSs (analogous to the brick-concrete structure) endows the obtained CBNA with a high strength. Moreover, the prepared CBNA is not cracked after the compressive test, which is ascribed to the 3D network structure. Above the PCM melting temperature, the external pressure is borne entirely by the aerogel, which primarily determined the shape-stability of the CPCM. If the aerogel deforms or shrinks under external pressure, the molten PCM will squeeze out of the pores and cause leakage. Therefore, unlike sponges, foams, or aerogels in other studies, the robust CBNA in this study ensures that the CPCM can withstand the harsh force impacts under application conditions.
Shape-stability and leakage-proof LA@CBNA
Molten LA can be automatically absorbed and diffused into the pores of CBNA based on the strong capillary force, surface tension, and hydrogen force. The resulting robust mechanical strength of CBNA confers the obtained LA@CBNA with a superior shape-stability. As shown in Fig. 3a, the ultrahigh porosity allows the CBNA to adsorb LA at more than 18 times its own weight. The SEM image in Fig. 3b shows that the CBNA pores are fully filled with LA, and a large number of BNNSs are uniformly dispersed in LA, which indicates their good compatibility. This tight integration between LA and CBNA effectively improves the thermal conductivity of LA@CBNA.

The shape-stability tests were applied primarily to verify whether CBNA can prevent the melted LA from overflowing when solid–liquid phase change occurs, especially when under pressure. All samples were placed on a hot stage at 60 °C. Fig. 3c shows that LA melted into a liquid and readily flowed after being heated for 15 min, while the prepared LA@CBNA could well maintain its original state and did not leak LA. The CPCM also keeps its outstanding shape-stability without leakage under an external pressure of 0.29 MPa, indicating that LA can be robustly encapsulated in the CBNA pores. The excellent shape stability of the CPCM benefits from the outstanding mechanical properties of CBNA and the strong interaction between CBNA and LA. It was found that the oriented structure also results in significantly enhanced heat charging/discharging rates by comparing the temperature–time curves between LA and LA@CBNA. As shown in Fig. 3d, the complete thermal charging of LA@CBNA takes approximately 98 min, while that of LA takes 175 min. The charging time is determined by analyzing the temperature–time profile and is defined as the time from the beginning of the heating to the end of the phase transition. The charging time of LA@CBNA is reduced by 44% compared to LA, which indicates that LA@CBNA makes rapid energy storage possible.
The FTIR and XRD measurements were respectively performed to examine the chemical and crystal structure evolutions, as shown in Fig. 3e and f. The strong absorption peak at 1387 cm−1 in the FTIR spectrum of CBNA is due to the perpendicular stretching vibration mode of B–N, while the sharper but weaker absorption peak at 807 cm−1 is attributed to the B–N–B bending vibration. These two strong characteristic vibration peaks also appear in the FTIR spectrum of LA@CBNA. Furthermore, the broadband at 3500–3200 cm−1, which is attributed to the –OH stretching vibration, is significantly weakened. The possible reason is that the –OH peak is shifted or fused into the C–H stretching vibration of –CH3 and –CH2. This illustrates that strong hydrogen bonding exists between LA and CBNA. The XRD patterns of LA@CBNA exhibit a distinguishable characteristic peak stack of CBNA and LA, especially in the crystalline region. However, the relative intensities of the characteristic diffraction peaks for LA@CBNA at 9.5°, 15.9°, and 23.7° show remarkable increases compared with LA, which demonstrates the further improved overall crystalline degree of highly crystallized LA. This result may be due to the preferential growth of LA crystals in the highly oriented micropores of CBNA.
The thermal stability was investigated by TGA and DTG, as displayed in Fig. 3g and h. The CBNA shows a high thermal stability before 200 °C and exhibits a 15% mass loss over 200–400 °C. The fastest mass loss temperature was 290.2 °C, and the 85% residue was from the BNNSs and CMC carbide. Both LA and LA@CBNA exhibit rapid one-step thermal degradation. The mass loss percentages of LA and LA@CBNA at 400 °C were determined to be 99.8% and 96.8%. Accordingly, the encapsulation rate of LA in CBNA is calculated to be 96.2%. More importantly, the starting and fastest decomposition temperatures of LA are 135.7 and 219.6 °C, while those of LA@CBNA increased significantly to 151.3 and 237.4 °C, respectively. The thermal stability enhancement is ascribed to the successful construction of a continuous thermal conductive pathway by the BNNSs and CMC, which can effectively transfer heat to its surroundings and reduce local overheating, which delays decomposition.
Thermophysical properties of LA@CBNA
The thermophysical properties of LA@CBNA, including the thermal conductivity, latent heat, and thermal reliability, play a crucial role in thermal management and energy storage. The low thermal conductivity is a major defect for organic PCMs, which significantly deteriorates the thermal transfer and storage efficiency, whereas the addition of heat conduction fillers significantly decreases the latent heat capacity. As shown in Fig. 4a, LA exhibits an inherently low thermal conductivity of 0.2011 W m−1 K−1, while the thermal conductivity of LA@CBNA increases by a factor of 5.68 to 1.1425 W m−1 K−1. The enhanced thermal conductivity is attributed to the following two reasons (Fig. 4g). First, the BNNS is a kind of 2D anisotropic nanomaterial and is more likely to show superior thermal conductivity when parallel to the in-plane. Second, phonons scatter less due to the highly ordered pathways and the wall structure formed by CMC/BNNS after compounding with LA. Furthermore, the melting/freezing temperature (Tm/Tf) and melting/freezing enthalpy (ΔHm/ΔHf) were extracted from the DSC curves (Fig. 4b) and summarized in Table 1. The CPCM has almost the same melting and freezing temperatures as LA, which indicates that the oriented CBNA has no obvious effect on its phase change behaviors. The CPCM exhibits an ultrahigh melting enthalpy of 190.4 J g−1, which is 98.1% that of LA. It is noted that the encapsulation rate extracted from the DSC measurements is much higher than that extracted from the TG results, which is attributed to the improved crystallinity of LA in the CPCM. Compared with the latent heat and thermal conductivity of other CPCMs, including graphene/PCM and carbon/PCM (Fig. 4h), LA@CBNA in this study shows the best performance with a superior energy storage capacity and efficiency.

Thermal cycling tests were performed to investigate whether the CPCM could meet the requirements of long-term use. Fig. 4c and d illustrate the DSC loops of the CPCM after different numbers of thermal cycles. The locations and relative areas of the melting and freezing peaks of the cycled CPCM coincide quite well with the uncycled sample, as detailed in Table S1.† The latent heat and phase change temperatures fluctuate by ±1.87% and 1.46 °C, respectively, throughout the entire thermal cycling, which is negligible for practical applications. Meanwhile, FTIR and XRD were used to detect structural and crystallinity changes, as shown in Fig. 4e and f. There are no new peaks or obvious changes in the FTIR spectra of the cycled LA@CBNA, and the XRD patterns well match those of the uncycled sample, suggesting that the chemical and crystal structures remain unchanged after 2000 thermal cycles. Based on these results, it is concluded that the as-synthesized CPCM exhibits robust thermal reliability and can operate over a long period of time for several application areas, such as thermal management and solar energy storage. Therefore, from the perspective of raw material selection, cost of the preparation method, and performances of the obtained CPCM, this work has broad potential for scaling-up application.
Thermal management of electronic devices
LA@CBNA can be applied as an ideal candidate for the thermal management of electronic devices because of its high thermal conductivity and large latent heat capacity to rapidly absorb a significant amount of heat at a nearly constant temperature. This material also exhibits outstanding shape stability after solid–liquid phase transitions. The thermal management performance of LA@CBNA was evaluated with a custom-designed test system (Fig. 5a). A commercial chip operating at different powers was attached to the CPCM and the surface temperature profile was recorded in real-time (Fig. 5b). The surface temperature of the bare chip after operating for 10 min reached 46.1 °C at 1 W, 61.5 °C at 1.5 W, 74.4 °C at 2 W, and 86.5 °C at 2.5 W. After LA@CBNA was employed, the surface temperature of the chip was reduced to 31.7 °C at 1 W, 39.8 °C at 1.5 W, 46.2 °C at 2 W, and 50.4 °C at 2.5 W. Thus, the surface temperatures of the chip were passively decreased by 14.7, 21.7, 28.2, and 36.1 °C, respectively. This opens the novel CPCM to new pathways for optimizing thermal protection effects in portable electronic devices, functional units, and biological tissue. The relatively high thermal conductivity guarantees quick dissipation of the generated heat from the hot to cold ends, and uncontrollable local temperature increases in the chip or battery are avoided. Once the temperature of the cold end increases above the phase change temperature of the PCM, the solid–liquid phase transition intervenes. The ultrahigh latent heat capacity also ensures a large thermal storage at a nearly constant low temperature, which effectively prevents thermal runaway and protects operators.

Electrical insulation is also another important concern for applications in electronics as short circuits may cause burnout. As shown in Fig. 5c, the volume electrical resistivity and electrical conductivity of LA are 55.54 MΩ cm−1 and 0.018 μS cm−1, indicating its inherently high electrical insulation characteristics. Although these change slightly to 47.5 MΩ cm−1 and 0.021 μS cm−1 for the CPCM, which is ascribed to the small CMC doping, the electrical insulation remains at an exceptional level. The outstanding electrical insulating and thermal management performances of LA@CBNA ensure the safe and efficient operation of electronics.
An ideal candidate for the thermal management of electronic devices or batteries should also be able to isolate the violent impact of extreme temperatures from external environments. The CPCM was deployed on custom-designed equipment with static and dynamic temperature changes. As shown in Fig. 5d, LA@CBNA shows characteristic plateau regions at approximately 43 °C during heating and cooling, which indicates that the CPCM can achieve the collection, transport, and cumulation of a vast amount of thermal energy from space and can undergo a reversible phase transition. Moreover, the thermal management capacity of CBNA and LA@CBNA was compared through dynamic temperature tests because the CMC/BNNS aerogel with an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.0534 W m−1 K−1 has an excellent heat/cold insulation capacity. As shown in Fig. 5e, increases and decreases in the surface temperature are reduced significantly in the environment after employing CBNA, which indicates that it is a good thermal insulating material due to the ultrahigh porosity. LA@CBNA can further reduce the temperature variations in the heating and cooling stages. The highest temperature is 10 °C lower than the environment, and the lowest temperature is 15 °C higher than the environment (Fig. 5f). These results demonstrate that this novel CPCM has a better heat/cold insulation capacity than aerogels in preventing temperature shock when subjected to environments with sharp temperature increases and falls. This provides a suitable working environment for electronic devices or batteries.
Solar-thermoelectric energy conversion
Increasing attention has been given to solar-driven direct solar-thermal energy collection and utilization in recent years by integrating PCMs. A typical solar-thermoelectric energy conversion system expecting all-spectrum solar-thermoelectric conversion was constructed, as shown in Fig. 6a. The CPCM was exposed to simulated solar irradiation, and the surface and inter-temperature variations were recorded in real-time using a thermographic camera and thermocouple, respectively. The surface temperature of CPCM-10 increased faster than LA and CPCM-0 after 200 s of illumination (Fig. 6b). CPCM-10 reached 50.5 °C, while CPCM-0 and LA reached 41.9 and 40.2 °C, respectively. In addition, a surface temperature of 50.5 °C for CPCM-10 indicates that it underwent a much faster phase change process than CPCM-0 and LA. These results suggest that graphene played the role of an effective photon–electron–phonon converter and can not only significantly enhance light absorption but also construct a more efficient thermal conductive pathway to improve the heat transfer rate.
 Fig. 6  (a) Solar-thermoelectric conversion system, (b) infrared images of the samples, temperature–time curves during and after (c) 1700 W m−2 sunlight irradiation and (d) different intensities, (e) solar irradiance and absorbance spectra of the samples, and (f) thermoelectric curves of CPCM-10. 
The solar-thermal conversion capacity was investigated under simulated solar irradiation. First, all samples were irradiated at the same intensity of 1700 W m−2, as shown in Fig. 6c. Compared with CPCM-0, the temperatures of CPCM-5 to CPCM-15 increased more rapidly upon irradiation, and a melting plateau in the temperature range of 40–45 °C appeared in the CPCM curves. When irradiation was removed, a freezing plateau between 35 and 40 °C emerged in the cooling curves. These results show that graphene can endow the CPCM with a good sunlight absorption ability and enables solar energy harvesting in the CPCM, which then efficiently converts this into thermal energy and stores it as latent heat. The solar-thermal conversion efficiency (η1) can be calculated using the formula:  where m and S are the mass and surface area of the sample, P is the sunlight intensity, and t1 and t2 are the starting and ending times of the phase transition, which are determined by the method shown in Fig. S1.† The details are listed in Table 2. The calculated η1 is 39.84% for CPCM-0, 51.97% for CPCM-5, 88.89% for CPCM-10, and 88.57% for CPCM-15. Hereafter, the solar-thermal performance of CPCM-10 was examined at different intensities of 700, 1000, and 1700 W m−2 (Fig. 6d and Table S2†). The η1 is calculated to be 49.69% at 700 W m−2, 69.74% at 1000 W m−2, and 88.89% at 1700 W m−2, respectively. The η1 increases with the solar irradiation intensity as the high solar flux shortens the energy storage duration and reduces heat losses.

Furthermore, UV-Vis-NIR spectra were applied to study the photo absorption capacity of the CPCM, as illustrated in Fig. 6e. The photo absorption capacity of LA is less than 40% over the UV and visible light regions, where solar energy dominates. CPCM-0 also exhibits a weak photo absorption of less than 55% over the entire UV-Vis-NIR range due to the poor solar absorption of the BNNS and CMC. However, CPCM-5 exhibits enhanced photo absorption above 70% over the UV-Vis-NIR range, indicating that a small amount of graphene significantly improves the solar absorption. With a further increase in the graphene content, the sunlight absorption capacity of CPCM-10 increased to around 90% over the entire spectrum. Moreover, the absorbance curve of CPCM-15 is similar to that of CPCM-10, suggesting that the solar absorption capacity saturates. In particular, the solar-thermal conversion includes the following three processes: (1) sunlight absorption and sunlight-thermal conversion; (2) thermal energy transport; and (3) thermal energy storage in the form of latent heat. Therefore, CPCM-10 exhibits the highest η1, which is ascribed to its relatively large latent heat, solar absorption capacity, and thermal conductivity. CPCM-10 achieves a more efficient solar-thermal energy conversion and is expected to have greater potential.
The solar-thermoelectric conversion of CPCM-10 was performed on self-designed equipment by placing the charged sample on a commercial Seebeck thermoelectric device with a 5 cm side length. The charged CPCM-10 was used as the hot end and a heat sink flowing with ice water (0 °C) was used as the cold end. The current (I) and voltage (U) generated by the Seebeck effect were recorded in real-time with a multimeter, and the temperature (°C) of the sample was recorded from a thermocouple, as illustrated in Fig. 6f. The open circuit current and voltage of the thermoelectric device increased rapidly when in contact with CPCM-10, which was followed by a gradual decrease before reaching stability. The maximum current and voltage generated are 12.36 mA and 231.57 mV, respectively. As time progressed, the current and voltage gradually decreased due to the smaller temperature difference between the hot and cold sides. It was noted that the continuous power generation time of the device exceeded 1400 s. Therefore, CPCM-10 maintained a long-term temperature stability through the liquid–solid transition process, which makes it suitable to output continuous and stable electricity in thermoelectric power generation. Furthermore, the thermoelectric energy efficiency (η2) and solar-thermoelectric efficiency (η) can be calculated using: (1) Ql = ΔH × m(2) Qs = Cs × m × ΔT(3) η = η1 × η2(4)where t1 and t2 are the starting and ending times of the power generated, Cs is the specific heat of CPCM-10, and ΔT is the temperature difference. Correspondingly, the η2 was calculated to be 61.38% and η was 54.56%. The relatively high solar-thermoelectric conversion capacity is attributed to the large latent heat in CPCM-10 and its long-term temperature stability. Based on these results, it was found that this novel CPCM exhibits preeminent solar-thermal and thermoelectric performances and provides a new prospect to improve solar-thermoelectric energy conversion and storage efficiency.
Conclusion
A green, robust, and versatile BNNS unidirectional aerogel with extraordinary mechanical properties that can withstand a maximum compressive stress of up to 0.9947 MPa was prepared to encapsulate LA. LA@CBNA exhibits an ultrahigh latent heat of 190.4 J g−1 and thermal conductivity of 1.1425 W m−1 K−1, which were 98.1% and 5.68 times that of LA, respectively. In addition, this novel CPCM displays effective thermal management by integrating phase change energy storage, heat conduction, and passive radiative cooling. The results of thermal management application tests show that the temperature of a working chip can be reduced by 36.1 °C at 2.5 W. The addition of a small amount of graphene (10% of the BNN) gives the CPCM an excellent solar-thermal conversion efficiency of 88.89% under simulated insolation, and the thermal conductivity is further improved to 1.2856 W m−1 K−1. Meanwhile, a solar-thermal energy conversion and storage system integrated with a thermoelectric generator achieves a maximum current of 12.36 mA and voltage of 231.57 mV, and the solar-thermoelectric conversion capacity is 54.56%. Therefore, the proposed strategy provides a promising new method to design and prepare integrated multifunctional CPCMs, which can be applied in the fields of thermal recovery, thermal management of electrical devices, and solar energy conversion and utilization.
