    , Accepted 16th March 2023First published on 16th March 2023AbstractThe study provides a proof of concept for the first time that unique palladium–gold (PdAu) and palladium–silver (PdAg) nanodendrites are bifunctional catalytic active sites for formate oxidation reactions (FORs) and formate dehydrogenation reactions (FDRs). The unique nanodendritic structure was developed via a simple galvanic displacement reaction for the direct growth of PdAu and PdAg nanodendrites on a nickel foam (PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF). These PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF electrodes exhibited 2.32 and 1.59 times higher specific activity than that of the commercial Pd/C electrode and promising stability toward FORs. Moreover, the PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF nanodendrites were also highly active and selective catalysts for hydrogen generation from a formate solution with turnover frequency (TOF) values of 311 h−1 and 287 h−1 respectively. Impressively, a passive air-breathing formate fuel cell with PdAu/NiNF used as an anode can yield an open-circuit voltage of 1.12 V and a peak power density of 21.7 mW cm−2, which outperforms most others reported in the literature. PdAu and PdAg nanodendritic catalysts supported on a nickel foam demonstrate an open structure and uniform catalyst distribution and offer a promising nanoalloy for air-breathing formate fuel cells and on-site chemical hydrogen production systems.
Introduction
Motivated mainly by the environmental crisis, sustainable renewable energy sources have become one of the most urgent needs in our lives with the development of modern industry, and the exploration of solar, wind, biomass and hydrogen energy is a top priority.1,2 More recently, direct formate fuel cells and reforming of formate for hydrogen generation have gained increasingly intense interest due to their high energy efficiency and safety.3 Among these potential energy carrier candidates, formate as a promising next-generation clean hydrogen carrier has attracted much attention and accomplished rapid development due to its high energy conversion efficiency, as well as its advantages of inflammability, environmentally friendly nature and facile storage and transport.4,5
Formate is a bifunctional hydrogen fuel.6 On the one hand, formate can be directly oxidized to generate electricity in formate fuel cells,7 that is, direct formate fuel cells (DFFCs), which directly convert chemical energy stored in formate into electricity. DFFCs have received more attention recently, mainly due to the use of carbon-neutral fuels which can be produced by various CO2 reduction reactions.8 Nonetheless, the most important electrochemical process in DFFCs is the anodic formate oxidation reaction, and it frequently suffers from sluggish kinetics, which considerably lowers the energy efficiency and hinders the further development of formate fuel cells.9,10 For formate oxidation reactions, palladium (Pd) has elevated catalytic activity and durability compared with the conventional platinum-based catalysts.11,12 Therefore, it is essential and urgent to rationally design a Pd-based electrocatalyst with high activity and long-term durability to effectively facilitate the anodic reaction.13
On the other hand, formate can be used as a hydrogen carrier to develop in situ reforming to produce hydrogen and supplied to proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).14 Reforming of formate for hydrogen generation has gained intense interest due to its high transport efficiency and safety.15 Hydrogen, as a very clean energy carrier, has far-reaching applications in many fields because of its high mass energy density and high efficiency, which will not cause environmental problems in the future applications.16 However, safe and efficient storage and release of hydrogen remains a bottleneck and challenge for a fuel-cell-based hydrogen economy.17 Recently, formate, as a kind of chemical hydrogen storage material with hydrogen generation at room temperature, has attracted increasing attention.18,19
Formate is non-toxic, non-corrosive, highly stable, and easy to handle due to their solid state at room temperature.20,21 More importantly, formate has been shown to be a thermodynamically excellent hydrogen storage material, which can produce little or no greenhouse gas, CO2.22 However, to the best of our knowledge, only few literature studies on the use of catalysts for formate dehydrogenation are available to date.23 Furthermore, there is no report on simultaneous formate oxidation reaction and hydrogen generation from formate.
Therefore, it is most important to rationally design a catalyst to overcome the above-mentioned issues. The first strategy is constructing some Pd-based nanoalloys.24,25 It is generally recognized that the unique physiochemical properties of nano-structured alloys predominantly depend on their size and morphology.26 Nanodendrites with highly hierarchical structure have become a new class of multifunctional catalytic nanomaterials due to their catalytic activity, porous structure, high electrical conductivity and specific surface area.27,28 Another strategy is support surface engineering, proved to be an efficient strategy to enhance the dehydrogenation catalytic efficiency.29,30 Meanwhile, for DFFCs, the anodic catalytic layer is commonly supported on carbon substrates.4 The catalyst requires further mixing of carbon material supports such as carbon black, and ionomer binders to form a suspension of a catalyst ink, which is then applied to the carbon substrate to prepare the electrode.31 The electrode prepared by this method generally has some shortcomings such as inconsistent catalyst dispersion and high contact resistance, which lead to poor catalytic performance.32,33 As a result, a nickel foam (NF) as a support has attracted much attention, thereby liberating the catalytic layer from carbon and also ionomer binders.34,35 Due to its electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, comparative inertness at an alkaline pH and low cost, the nickel foam is an effective current collector and an excellent support for active material deposition.36,37 In addition, the nickel foam has an expanded geometric surface area, high porosity, good mass transport, and fine 3D structure, which make it an attractive support for heterogeneous catalysts.24,38
In order to further improve the surface area and active site of the nickel foam support, surface engineering is applied to the nickel foam.39 Surface engineering is typically an effective way to tune the surface morphology and structure of the support to further enhance the catalytic activity and stability.40,41 For example, Fan et al.,42 designed a 3D porous copper structure by anodic oxidation and high-temperature reduction. This unique structure is the combination of a 1D nanowire array (approximately 150–200 nm) and 3D porous structures (approximately 5 μm) that facilitate rapid ion and electron transport. Antimony is electrodeposited on batteries. Li et al.,35 reported that the large area vertically aligned bismuth nanosheet arrays on copper substrates with different shapes and sizes obtained by a galvanic replacement reaction, with over 90% catalytic selectivity for formate production synthesis and a large current density of 45 mA cm−2 at −0.95 V. Fan et al.,26 developed a Ni3S2 nanosheet array on controllable 3D porous nickel, which considerably improves the fast charge and discharge performance of sodium-ion batteries. This 3D porous nickel structure is an effective way to reinforce the cycle stability of sodium-ion batteries. Consequently, we report a surface-modified nickel foam (NiNF) as a support with a different morphology and improved structure, leading to significant improvements in the performance of DFFCs and hydrogen generation at room temperature.
In this context, the development of surface-modified nickel foams as supports for constructing alloy anodes will be an effective method because it can not only control the construction of nanoscale anodic catalysts but also accomplish the robust interconnection between the active anodic catalyst layer and the support. In this work, PdAu and PdAg nanodendritic catalysts were synthesized directly on a nickel foam support (PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF) for the first time. PdAu and PdAg nanodendrites were synthesized by a galvanic displacement reaction, which is an environmentally friendly and straightforward method.43 In this process, the catalysts were grown directly on the support, which freed the catalytic layer from the carbon and also binder (e.g., Teflon). the electrochemical performance of PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF is expected to be guaranteed at both the catalyst level and the electrode level simultaneously. The as-synthesized PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF nanodendrites exhibit higher electrocatalytic performance for FORs than that of the commercial Pd/C electrode in alkaline media, enhanced performance in the passive air-breathing formate fuel cell and impressive hydrogen generation characteristics from the formate solution. It is believed that this novel strategy provides a new guideline for optimizing hydrogen generation from formate, direct formate fuel cells and other related power sources for portable electronics.
Experimental
Materials
Gold chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·4H2O, >99.9%), palladium nitrate dihydrate (Pd(NO3)2·3H2O, >99.9%), silver nitrate (AgNO3, >99.9%) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were obtained from Guangdong Guanghua Sci-Tech Co. Ltd. Nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O, >99.9%), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, >99.9%) and potassium formate (HCOOK) were purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute. Pd/C (30 wt%) was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Pt/C (20 wt%) was purchased from Shanghai Hesen Electric Limited Company. The anion-exchange membrane was Fumapem AM-40. Bare Ni foams with a purity of 99.8% (pore per inch: 120; density: 370 g m−2; average pore size: 500 μm; thickness: 1 mm) were purchased from Taiyuan Lizhiyuan Battery Material Limited Company. Double-distilled water was used in all the experiments. All chemicals used in these experiments were of analytical grade.
Electrode preparation
A bare Ni foam was pretreated to remove oils and the native oxide layer prior to experimental deposition. It was immersed in acetone and a dilute sulphuric acid (5%) solution under ultrasonication for 30 minutes respectively. Then, it was ultrasonicated in an ethanol solution and double-distilled water for 15 minutes respectively. To prepare the anode electrodes with Pd–Au and Pd–Ag nanodendrite catalysts on a Ni foam support, a pre-treated bare Ni foam was first immersed in an aqueous solution of NiCl2·6H2O (0.1 M) and NH4Cl (2 M) for electrodeposition. The synthesis of a Ni foam support was accomplished in a three-electrode electrochemical cell at room temperature, using the bare Ni foam, a Pt electrode and an Ag/AgCl/KClsat electrode as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The applied constant current during the electrodeposition was −0.25 A cm−2 for 300 s. After deposition, the as-prepared Ni foam support was washed with double-distilled water and dried under a N2 flow. Second, two metal precursors (HAuCl4 and Pd(NO3)2) or (AgNO3 and Pd(NO3)2) with controlled molar ratios were added to double-distilled water and ultrasonically dispersed for 30 minutes. After the ultrasonic dispersion treatment, the as-prepared Ni foam support was immersed into metal precursor solutions for 1 h or 0.5 h, washed with double-distilled water and then dried under a N2 flow.
The cathode electrode was prepared with commercial Pt/C on the bare nickel foam: first, a suspension of 10 mg Pt/C and 10 mg Nafion solution (Nafion, 5 wt%) in an ethanol solution was obtained by an ultrasonic dispersion method. The as-prepared suspension was then coated on the bare nickel foam and dried for 3 h. The cathode electrode consists of a gaseous diffusion layer (the preparation method has been described in our previous work) and a catalyst on the bare nickel foam layer. The cathode electrode was obtained by pressing the gaseous diffusion layer with the coated nickel foam for 30 s at a pressure of 10 MPa. The anode electrode was prepared with commercial Pd/C on the bare nickel foam: first, a suspension of 10 mg Pd/C and 10 mg Nafion solution (Nafion, 5 wt%) in an ethanol solution was obtained by an ultrasonic dispersion method. The as-prepared suspension was then coated onto the bare nickel foam and dried for 3 h. The anode electrode was obtained by pressing the coated nickel foam for 30 s at a pressure of 10 MPa.
Physical characterization
Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images were acquired using a ZEISS Gemini 500 field emission scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The detailed morphology and nanostructure of the samples were studied using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, FEI TecnaiF30). The phase and crystallinity of the samples were acquired by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a PANalytical X'Pert Pro MPD instrument equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was carried out using an ESCALAB 250 instrument with monochromatic Al Kα radiation (ultrahigh vacuum, 10−9 Torr).
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI660C electrochemical workstation utilizing a three-electrode system. A Hg/HgO electrode and a Pt electrode were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The electrocatalytic properties of the samples for formate oxidation reactions were tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). All CV results were obtained in N2-saturated solution of 1 M KOH and 1 M HCOOK at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. All potential values in this paper were scaled versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of the samples were calculated by integrating the region charge of a Pd oxidation peak in a N2-saturated 1 M KOH solution at 50 mV s−1 (charge density of 405 μC cm−2 for the adsorption of an oxygen monolayer).
Fuel cell test
A passive air-breathing formate fuel cell that consists of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) sandwiched between two anode fuel and cathode airfields. The MEA is composed of an anode electrode, an anion exchange membrane, and a cathode electrode. The construction of the fuel cell was described in detail in our previous work.44 The performance was measured by discharging tests and stability tests utilizing a battery testing system (Neware Technology Limited Company, Shenzhen, China). The cathode side was air, and the anode side was 4 M KOH + 5 M HCOOK aqueous solution.
Hydrogen generation from formate solution
The as-synthesized PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF catalysts and 30 mL potassium formate solution (6 M, the detailed experiment for the solution concentration optimization is shown in Fig. S1†) were kept in a two-necked round-bottom flask, and the temperature of the oil bath and the reaction was controlled through the double temperature control system. The gas produced by the reaction was passed through a sodium hydroxide solution and a cuprous chloride solution in turn to remove carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide produced, and then through the gas burette; the volume of hydrogen generated was obtained by recording the scale difference on the gas burette, and the reaction time was 1 h.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 depicts the complete synthesis process of Pd–Au and Pd–Ag nanodendrites on a Ni foam support. Take PdAu/NiNF as an example; in the first step, the Ni foam support was treated by electrodeposition using a three-electrode system. After that, the Pd–Au nanodendrite was synthesized directly on a Ni foam support by the galvanic displacement reaction. The mechanism of galvanic displacement reaction is the large difference of the redox potentials of Ni2+/Ni (−0.25 V vs. SHE), Pd2+/Pd (0.92 V vs. SHE), Au+/Au (1.42 V vs. SHE), and Ag+/Ag (0.799 V vs. SHE). The galvanic displacement reaction occurred among Pd, Au, Ag and Ni as follows: Ni (s) + Pd2+ (aq) → Ni2+ (aq) + Pd (s)(1) Ni (s) + 2Au+ (aq) → Ni2+ (aq) + 2Au (s)(2) Ni (s) + 2Ag+ (aq) → Ni2+ (aq) + 2Ag (s).(3)

In sharp contrast to other approaches, electrodeposition and the galvanic displacement reaction have the advantages of a comparatively friendly environment, convenient operation and easy composition control.45,46 Furthermore, the galvanic displacement reaction in an electrolyte solution makes it easy and time-saving to obtain ideal nanostructures at room temperature.47,48 As a result, PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF reveal a superior electrochemical property that serves as a binder-free, self-supported electrode for formate fuel cells. In addition, in situ growth can assure that the as-prepared electrodes have an intense intimate contact between the Pd–Au and PdAg nanodendrites and the Ni foam support.

Fig. 2 shows the surface morphologies of the bare Ni foam and the as-prepared Ni foam (NiNF) support at different magnifications. As shown in Fig. 2a, the bare Ni foam displays the smooth surface. When the Ni foam is immersed into the solution for electrodeposition, the smooth surface of Ni foam is covered by massively microscopic Ni-particles (Fig. 2b inset) and becomes rough (Fig. 2b). To further increase the surface area of the Ni foam, nickel dendrites were electrodeposited onto the Ni foam to form a porous dendritic morphology.

The surface microstructure of PdAu/NiNF fabricated by a galvanic displacement reaction under the optimum conditions at different magnifications is shown in Fig. 3a–c. The SEM images of Fig. 3a and b demonstrated that the PdAu catalyst was uniformly distributed on the as-prepared Ni foam, forming a hierarchical structure. In addition, it can be recognized that the PdAu catalyst is composed of homogeneous nanodendrite units with a high morphological yield, which is further confirmed by the high-magnification SEM image (Fig. 3c). To gain insights into the elemental distribution in PdAu/NiNF, the EDS analysis was performed to obtain the mapping of Pd, Au and Ni, as shown in Fig. 3d–g, clearly demonstrating that Pd and Au were uniformly deposited on the framework of the as-prepared Ni foam. Additionally, the EDS analysis of the entire region in Fig. 3d shows that the Pd/Au atomic ratio of the as-prepared PdAu/NiNF is 53.48:46.52, which is almost the same as the nominal ratio of 1:1 in the precursor solution and indicates that the composition of the PdAu alloy is homogeneous.

The growth of PdAg catalyst arrays on the as-prepared Ni foam support was achieved by the same reaction, as shown in Fig. 4. It is visible that the PdAg nanodendrites form a thin catalyst layer and densely cover the surface of the as-prepared Ni foam support (Fig. 4a–c). Elemental analysis of PdAg/NiNF was carried out by EDS mapping, as shown in Fig. 4d–g. EDS analysis of the whole region showed that the molar ratio of Pd/Ag on the as-prepared Ni foam was 74.32:25.68, which was close to the nominal ratio of 3:1 in the precursor solution. Nevertheless, Fig. 4e and f depict the EDS mapping of elements Pd and Ag, revealing that the concentration of Ag on the surface is higher than that of Pd on the surface, accordingly, signifying that the Ag element is enriched on the surface, while more Pd exists in the core, because of the lower surface energy of Ag than that of Pd.49,50

The nickel-supported PdM (M = Au and Ag) nanodendrites before and after catalysis were further characterized by TEM and HRTEM, as shown in Fig. 5. The nanodendrite structure of PdAu before and after catalysis is obviously displayed in Fig. 5a and b; the lattice spacing is 0.228 (Fig. 5c and d) nm, which is between the lattice spacing of the Pd(111) and Au(111) planes, indicating the formation of bimetallic PdAu alloy. The TEM images of the as-prepared PdAg catalyst are shown in Fig. 5e and f, and it is clearly observed that the as-prepared PdAg catalyst has the dendritic morphologies with fewer secondary branches, and the lattice spacing of 0.229 nm (Fig. 5g and h) is among that of the Pd(111) and Ag(111) planes, indicating the formation of the bimetallic PdAg alloy. After catalysis, the nanodendrite structure of PdM is maintained, indicating the structural stability of catalyst.

The crystal structure of the resulting product was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 6a and b clearly show that PdAu and PdAg nanodendrites displayed a single set of diffraction peaks assignable to a face-centred cubic (fcc) structure. Each of the peaks was located between the corresponding peaks of pure Pd and pure Au or pure Pd and pure Ag, indicating alloy formation between PdAu and PdAg. It can also be seen from Fig. 6a and b that the PdAu and PdAg nanoalloys maintained the stability of the crystal structure during the catalytic reaction.

The red, green and blue solid lines in (a) refer to the XRD patterns of pure Pd (no. 04–0784), Au (no. 04–0783) and Ag (no. 46–1043). XPS spectra of nickel-supported PdAu nanodendrites before and after catalysis: (c) Pd 3d and (d) Au 4f. XPS spectra of nickel-supported PdAg nanodendrites before and after catalysis: (e) Pd 3d and (f) Ag 3d. 
The surface chemical states of nickel-supported PdM (M = Au and Ag) nanodendrites were also investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). High-resolution XPS spectra were employed to investigate the surface chemical states, as shown in Fig. 6c–f. From the high-resolution metallic Pd0 (3d5/2 and 3d3/2), Ag0 (3d5/2 and 3d3/2) and Au0 (4f7/2 and 4f5/2) spectra, the formation of the bimetallic PdAu and PdAg alloys is suggested. Before and after catalysis, the chemical states of PdM (M = Au and Ag) nanodendrites remained unchanged.
To attain the optimal conditions, we assessed the electrode performance toward formate oxidation by depositing PdAu and PdAg on the as-prepared Ni foam by a galvanic displacement reaction applying different reaction time periods. The electrochemical formate oxidation occurring on the electrode at different reaction time periods was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), which was performed in N2-saturated 1 M KOH and 1 M HCOOK at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 7a. The results indicated that the FOR activity of PdAu initially increased as the reaction time increased from 0.5 h to 1 h; nevertheless, the peak current density diminished when the reaction time reached 2 h, because the size of PdAu particles became bristly as the reaction time increased, which was likely to lead to the agglomeration of PdAu particles and reduction in the number of active catalyst sites.28 The influence of the reaction time on the catalytic activity of PdAg is also illustrated in Fig. 7a, and the peak current density diminished with the increase in reaction time. The variation in reaction time can alter the size of PdAg particles and further lead to different distributions of the catalyst as same as PdAu. A reasonable reaction time brings about the uniform distribution of catalyst particles on the support. Consequently, the reaction times of 1 h and 0.5 h for PdAu and PdAg were selected in the following research, respectively. In addition, a notably higher activity was also observed for this as-prepared Ni foam (NiNF) than that for the NF, as shown in Fig. 7a. This is due to the altered morphology of this catalyst when moving from the NF to NiNF, leading to an enhanced density of accessible active sites.51 This significant increase in activity also verified that the NiNF is a highly interesting anode support material for fuel cells.

Fig. 7b–d illustrates the catalytic properties of the prepared PdAu/NiNF, PdAg/NiNF and the commercial Pd/C electrodes. Fig. 7b depicts the CV curves of PdAu/NiNF, PdAg/NiNF and the commercial Pd/C electrode in N2-saturated 1 M KOH. The peaks at around 0.2 V are the desorption and adsorption peaks of hydrogen underpotential deposition (Hupd), respectively.52 The peak at around 0.9 V corresponds to the Pd oxidation, while the reduction peak of Pd oxide is around 0.7 V.52 The reduction peak of the PdAu/NiNF is larger than that of commercial Pd/C, indicating that PdAu/NiNF adsorbed more hydroxyl groups, and more Pd is oxidized by oxygen-containing adsorbents.53Fig. 7c demonstrates the catalytic performance of the prepared PdAu/NiNF, PdAg/NiNF and the commercial Pd/C electrodes toward formate electro-oxidation, which was assessed by obtaining CV curves in N2-saturated 1 M KOH with 1 M HCOOK at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. It can be observed that the prepared PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF electrodes have superior specific activity to commercial Pd/C, while the Ni foam electrode is found to be catalytically inert, as shown in Fig. S2.† The peak current densities of PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF are 10.37 mA cm−2 and 7.11 mA cm−2, which are 2.32 and 1.59 times higher than that of Pd/C (4.47 mA cm−2), respectively. The activity of PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF catalysts was compared with those of the reported FOR electrocatalysts in Table S1.†

Fig. 7d shows the chronoamperometric (CA) stability curves for PdAu/NiNF, PdAg/NiNF and commercial Pd/C tested in N2-saturated 1 M KOH and 1 M HCOOK solutions at 0.7 V. The catalytic activity of the catalysts declined during the operation, which can be explained as follows.2 First, the intermediates H and CO32− as an example were adsorbed onto the PdAu and PdAg catalyst surfaces, which inhibited the formate electro-oxidation. Second, some impurities in the formate solution (SO42− or Cl−, for instance), were adsorbed onto the catalyst surfaces, which diminished the active sites of surfaces. In addition, as the catalytic reaction continues, the concentration of formate near the working electrode decreases, and the long-term potential cycle leads to partial oxidation of the catalyst. As a result, the activity of the catalyst declines rapidly in the initial stage and then begins to enter a steady state. After a durability test was performed for 3600 s, the remaining current densities were 3.84 mA cm−2, 1.99 mA cm−2 and 0.43 mA cm−2 for PdAu/NiNF, PdAg/NiNF and commercial Pd/C, respectively. The remaining current density of PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF was 8.93 and 4.63 times larger than that of commercial Pd/C after 3600 s, respectively. PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF exhibited comparatively excellent activity and better stability to the FOR. This result could be attributed to not only the PdAu and PdAg particles uniformly distributed on the surface of the as-prepared Ni foam, which enhanced the utilization of Pd, but also the stronger linkage between the catalysts and the support.
The power generation performance of passive air-breathing formate fuel cells can characterize the electrode activity in practical applications. A passive air-breathing formate fuel cell consisting of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) sandwiched between two anodic fuel and cathode airfields. The MEA is composed of an anode electrode, an anion-exchange membrane, and a cathode electrode.54,55Fig. 8a displays the polarization curves of the passive air-breathing formate fuel cell with different anodes. For the passive air-breathing formate fuel cell with the PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF anodes, the peak power densities are 21.7 mW cm−2 and 12.3 mW cm−2 respectively; moreover, the limiting current densities are 76 mA cm−2 and 50 mA cm−2 respectively. These results are superior to that for the passive air-breathing formate fuel cell with the commercial Pd/C anode; in particular, the passive air-breathing formate fuel cell with the PdAu/NiNF anode exhibited a peak power density of 21.7 mW cm−2 and a limiting current density of 76 mA cm−2, which were 2.97 and 2.53 times higher than that of the commercial Pd/C anode (7.3 mW cm−2) and (30 mA cm−2), respectively.

Stability tests at different current densities and comparison of the passive air-breathing formate fuel cell with (b) commercial Pd/C, (c) PdAg/NiNF and (d) PdAu/NiNF anode. 
Stability is an essential factor in determining the passive air-breathing formate fuel cell performance. The stability is tested by monitoring the voltage variation during the constant current discharge. The passive air-breathing formate fuel cell voltage was recorded at constant currents of 5, 10, 20 and 30 mA cm−2. Fig. 8c and d illustrate the stability test of the passive air-breathing formate fuel cell with the PdAg/NiNF and PdAu/NiNF anodes at different current densities. Simultaneously, the passive air-breathing formate fuel cell with the commercial Pd/C anode was tested under the same condition for comparison, as shown in Fig. 8b. The voltage drops because of the depletion of the formate solution, where the formate solution will be refreshed. This is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 8c and d, and the voltages of the passive air-breathing formate fuel cell with PdAg/NiNF and PdAu/NiNF anodes are higher than that of the commercial Pd/C anode at each current density throughout the test cycle. In addition, the passive air-breathing formate fuel cell with PdAg/NiNF and PdAu/NiNF anodes likewise has longer stable times than that with the commercial Pd/C anode during each formate solution refresh cycle. The passive air-breathing formate fuel cell developed in this research exhibited an excellent performance compared with other passive air-breathing formate fuel cells presented in the literature, as listed in Table 1. The outstanding performance of the passive air-breathing formate fuel cell with the PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF anodes is a result of synergy between high electrocatalytic activities of PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF and the as-prepared Ni foam support, which could enhance the utilization of the active area inside of the three-dimensional electrode56 and the convective/diffusive mass transfer rate of the catalytic active sites.57 In summary, all the results have verified the vital role of the as-prepared Ni foam in boosting the electrocatalytic capability of PdAu and PdAg catalysts toward the FOR and passive air-breathing formate fuel cells.

The formate solution can also be used as a chemical hydrogen storage carrier and decomposed to hydrogen generation. The as-synthesized PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF catalyst were evaluated as catalysts for hydrogen generation from potassium formate solution decomposition in an ambient atmosphere, and the total volume of the released hydrogen gas is shown in Fig. 9. Compared with the PdAg/NiNF catalyst, the PdAu/NiNF catalyst exhibits more gas volume toward potassium formate solution decomposition, in the first 30 minutes and the end of reaction time (1 h). PdAg/NiNF and PdAu/NiNF exhibit a catalytic activity for the decomposition of the potassium formate solution with 40 mL and 49 mL of hydrogen gas generated in 60 min, corresponding to TOF values of 287 h−1 and 311 h−1 respectively, indicating that PdAg/NiNF and PdAu/NiNF can be used as potential catalysts for hydrogen generation from formate. The hydrogen generation activity of nickel-supported PdM (M = Au and Ag) nanodendrites was compared with those of the reported hydrogen generation catalysts in Table 2.

Conclusions
In this work, we described for the first time the preparation of PdAu and PdAg nanodendrites grown on the as-prepared Ni foam support via a facile electrodeposition method and a galvanic replacement reaction to facilitate FORs and boost passive air-breathing formate fuel cell performance. In particular, the PdAu/NiNF electrode demonstrated a specific activity of 10.37 mA cm−2, which is 2.32 times higher than that of the commercial Pd/C electrode. In addition, the PdAu/NiNF electrode displayed a superior performance for passive air-breathing formate fuel cells, with a maximum power density of 21.7 mW cm−2 and a limiting current density of 76 mA cm−2, as well as satisfactory stability, outperforming other passive air-breathing formate fuel cells reported in the literature. This excellent performance is primarily attributed to the open architecture of the as-prepared Ni foam support that facilitates rapid mass transport and the high catalytic activity of PdAu and PdAg nanodendrites. This proposed electrode design, because of its simplicity and effectiveness, may provide a new way to construct electrode frameworks for high-performance passive air-breathing formate fuel cells. PdAu/NiNF and PdAg/NiNF prepared in this work have good catalytic performance for the decomposition of formate solutions and can be used as practical formate hydrogen storage systems.
