Introduction
Deep ultraviolet photodetectors (DUVPDs) that can work in the solar-blind region (220–280 nm) with excellent accuracy and precision have drawn great attention in applications of flame detection, short-wave communication, missile detection, and ozone hole monitoring.1–6 In the past few years, numerous semiconductors have been investigated as the core component of DUVPDs, which convert input photons to output electricity signal. Among them, AlGaN, ZnMgO, ZnGaO and diamond based DUVPDs have been reported successively.7–10 However, the synthesis processes of these materials are complex and costly, and the crystal quality significantly deteriorates with the tuning of bandgap to meet the demand for the DUVPD fabrication. Recently, monoclinic β-Ga2O3 with a direct bandgap of 4.9 eV has shown tremendous potential for applications of high-power and optoelectronic devices.11–14 Combining the merits of high carrier mobility, a low-cost and easy synthesis process, and high physical and chemical stability, various kinds of β-Ga2O3 based solar-blind photodetectors (PDs) have been studied.14–16 However, the responsivity and response time of these PDs are always compromised, which restricts their performance in practical applications. Although β-Ga2O3 nanometer scale PDs have shown improved performance, their fabrication and characterization processes are costly and sophisticated, and the synthesis process is not compatible with current semiconductor technology for mass fabrication.16–18 In the meantime, solar-blind PDs based on β-Ga2O3 thin films present unsatisfying performance due to the absence of p-type doped β-Ga2O3 to form a p–n junction, and various substrates and epitaxial layers have been adopted to produce p–n heterojunctions as an alternative strategy.15,19,20
In recent years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) are emerging as promising optoelectronic materials due to their superior characteristics of high quantum efficiency, long carrier diffusion length, high absorption coefficient, and low-cost solution processing. Photovoltaic and photoelectric devices based on CH3NH3PbX3 have been widely reported and shown persistent enhanced performance.21,22 For the application of photodetectors, interface engineering using hybrid structures has proved to be an effective approach to improve the device performance. Up to now, CH3NH3PbI3 hybrids with conjugated-polymer composites (PDPP3T and C8BTBT) and two-dimensional materials (graphene, WSe2 and WS2) have been investigated and shown enhanced photodetector performance such as low dark current, high responsivity, and high detectivity.23–26 In particular, the study of CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO-nanowire hybrid structures has shown the potential for performance-enhanced PDs in the UV region, which possess a faster response time and higher responsivity compared with the pure ZnO-nanowire PDs.27
Inspired by all of this, here, we demonstrate a solar-blind photodetector based on a CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 hybrid structure for the first time. The CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 hybrid structure was developed via a facile and low-cost solution processing strategy. Compared with the pure β-Ga2O3 DUVPD, the performance of the PD based on the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 hybrid structure was significantly enhanced. The photo-to-dark current ratio is 1460, the responsivity and detectivity are 85 mA W−1 and 1.28 × 1011 Jones, respectively. The device exhibits excellent reproducibility and stability under DUV light illumination; the rise and decay time are 0.11 and 0.45 s, respectively. The superior solar-blind/UVA rejection ratio (I254nm/I325nm) with a value of 221 indicates that our fabricated photodetector has an excellent sensitivity in the solar-blind region. Further, the energy band diagram of the hybrid structure was analyzed to understand the enhanced performance of the photodetector.
Experimental section
Photodetector fabrication
The fabrication process of the photodetector is illustrated in Fig. 1(a); an ohmic contact (Ti: 10 nm/Au: 100 nm) was first formed on the bottom of a washed (−201)-orientated β-Ga2O3 substrate (1 cm × 1 cm × 650 μm). Commercial Scotch tape with a size of 0.2 × 0.2 cm was then stuck uniformly on the substrate as a physical mask. CH3NH3PbI3 film was subsequently spin-coated on the surface of the β-Ga2O3 substrate. The perovskite films were synthesized through a one-step solution process, in which the methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) and lead iodide (PbI2) precursors were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) containing dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The molar ratio of CH3NH3I:PbI2:DMSO = 1:1:4 was adopted to form the perovskite precursor solution. The details of the substrate washing process and CH3NH3PbI3 film preparation can be found in our previous studies.28,29 After coating with CH3NH3PbI3 film, a Au electrode with 100 nm thickness was deposited on the CH3NH3PbI3 film by direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering with a low power (20 W). Finally, the tape was removed to expose the β-Ga2O3 surface as the photosensitive element. By using this specific hybrid structure, the absorption from the CH3NH3PbI3 film is restrained, and the Au electrode can act as an isolation layer that blocks air to prevent the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3.

Material and device characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu XRD7000) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm) was used to investigate the crystalline structure of the CH3NH3PbI3 film. The surface morphologies of the films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JEM-6701F). Optical transmittance spectra were obtained using a spectrometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 950). The characteristics of the photodetectors were analyzed using a Keysight B1500A semiconductor parameter analyzer. The light source with different wavelengths (254 and 365 nm) was a DUV lamp with a fixed power intensity (0.86 mW cm−2). The power of the DUV lamp was measured by an optical power meter (NOVA II). DUVPDs based on a pure β-Ga2O3 substrate without the added CH3NH3PbI3 film were also fabricated and tested under the same conditions for comparison. All measurements were performed in air at room temperature.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(b) shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 hybrid structure; the spin-coated CH3NH3PbI3 film with a thickness of 200 nm is homogeneously distributed on the β-Ga2O3 substrate. Fig. 1(c) presents the top-view SEM image of the CH3NH3PbI3 film, which covers the substrate uniformly with a wide range of crystal sizes between 1 and 5 μm. Fig. 1(d) shows the grazing incidence XRD pattern of the CH3NH3PbI3 film; three peaks with very small full width at half-maximum (FWHM) values located at 2θ = 14.17, 28.50, and 43.30 corresponding to the (110), (220), and (330) planes of the tetragonal structure CH3NH3PbI3 emerged, respectively.21,30Fig. 1(e) presents the XRD pattern of the β-Ga2O3 substrate; three peaks are located at 18.97°, 38.42°, and 59.13°, indexed as the (−201), (−402), and (−603) planes of β-Ga2O3 (JCPDS CARD No. 431012), respectively.31 Both SEM and XRD results indicate the good quality of the synthesized CH3NH3PbI3 film on the β-Ga2O3 substrate, ensuring the performance of the photodetector based on this hybrid structure.

Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the I–V characteristics of the DUVPDs based on the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 hybrid structure and pure β-Ga2O3 in the dark, and under 365 and 254 nm light irradiation, respectively. Both devices display a typical rectification property due to the existence of potential barriers. For the pure β-Ga2O3 device, the rectification property can be ascribed to the Schottky potential barrier forming at the interface between the top Au electrode and the β-Ga2O3 substrate. While for the device based on the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 hybrid structure, an ohmic contact forms between the Au electrode and the CH3NH3PbI3 film, which has been proved in our previous studies.29 Thus, the rectification property is attributed to the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 heterojunction. It is noticeable that a pronounced zero-drift (∼6 V) arises for the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 DUVPD; similar phenomena have been reported in both our and others’ studies.28,32–34 The zero-drift was weakened under 365 nm light illumination, and it disappeared under 254 nm light illumination. This phenomenon is attributed to the mobile ion-drift induced current under the dark condition. When illuminated under 365 nm light, only a few photo-induced carriers are generated in β-Ga2O3 (due to the defects of β-Ga2O3, as well as a little absorption from the sides of the CH3NH3PbI3 film) and transport to the CH3NH3PbI3 film to overlap with the mobile ion-drift induced current. The mobile ion-drift induced current still dominated the I–V characteristic and the zero-drift was weakened. Once the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 DUVPD was illuminated with 254 nm light, a mass of photo-induced carriers was generated due to the strong absorption and high optic-electric conversion of β-Ga2O3, the photo-induced current overwhelms the mobile ion-drift induced current in the heterojunction, and thus the zero-drift disappeared. In addition, the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 DUVPD exhibits two different I–V shoulders in the forward direction, which indicates the existence of barrier height inhomogeneity and can be attributed to the direct contact of the Au electrode and β-Ga2O3 substrate due to the non-uniformly distributed CH3NH3PbI3 film around the photosensitive window (as shown in Fig. 1(a)).35–37 The rectification ratio (I2V/I−10V) for the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 heterojunction and pure β-Ga2O3 based devices is 17032 and 43, respectively.

I–V characteristics of the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 hybrid structure (a) and pure β-Ga2O3 (b) based DUVPDs in the dark, and under 365 and 254 nm light illumination. 
At the reverse bias of 10 V, the dark current of the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 heterojunction based DUVPD is 0.56 nA, and the photocurrent under 365 and 254 nm illumination are 3.67 nA and 0.81 mA, respectively. The photo-to-dark current ratio (PDCR) at 365 and 254 nm are 6.60 and 1460.43, respectively. The solar-blind/UVA rejection ratio (I254nm/I325nm) at −10 V is more than 221. In contrast, the dark current of the pure β-Ga2O3 DUVPD is 0.21 mA, the photocurrent under 365 and 254 nm illumination are 0.46 and 3.16 mA, and the corresponding PDCR are 2.17 and 14.76, respectively. The solar-blind/UVA rejection ratio for the pure β-Ga2O3 DUVPD is only 6.8. It can be seen that both DUVPDs exhibit solar-blind characteristics, while the PD performances are significantly enhanced after decorating with the CH3NH3PbI3 film.
To quantitatively evaluate the performance of the as-fabricated DUVPDs, the key figure-of-merit (FOM) parameters, i.e. responsivity (Rλ), specific detectivity (D*), external quantum efficiency (EQE), and photosensitivity linear dynamic range (LDR), were calculated by the following equations:6Rλ = Iλ − Idark/(PλS), D* = RλS1/2/(2eIdark)1/2, EQE = hcRλ/eλ, and LDR = 20log(Iλ/Idark), respectively, where Iλ and Idark are the photo and dark current flow through the device, respectively, Pλ is the illumination intensity, S is the effective illuminated area on the PHDs, h is Plank's constant, and e is the electron charge. The calculated FOM parameters for the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 hybrid structure and pure β-Ga2O3 based DUVPDs under different illumination conditions are listed in Table 1. After coating with the CH3NH3PbI3 film, the Rλ and EQE are 85.66 mA W−1 and 41.87%, which change a little compared with the pure β-Ga2O3 DUVPD (107.27 mA W−1 and 52.43%) due to the comparable photocurrent under 254 nm light illumination. While the D* and LDR are remarkably improved from 8.24 × 108 Jones and 23.38 dB to 1.28 × 1011 Jones and 63.29 dB. These enhanced FOM parameters indicate that the decoration with the CH3NH3PbI3 film can significantly improve the photosensitivity of the DUVPDs.

The dynamic response speed is also an important FOM parameter to evaluate the practical performance of photodetectors. The time-dependent photoresponse (I–t curve) of the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 hybrid structure as well as the pure β-Ga2O3 DUVPDs was measured under 254 nm periodic illumination at −10 V bias, as shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. The on/off switching behaviors of both devices appear alternately according to the periodic illumination, which indicates that our fabricated DUVPDs have excellent reproducibility and stability under DUV light illumination. To further quantitatively assess the transient response of the as-fabricated DUVPDs, the temporal rise and decay curves of the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 hybrid structure as well as the pure β-Ga2O3 DUVPDs were extracted and fitted in Fig. 3(c) and (d), respectively. For the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 hybrid DUVPD, the rise and decay curves are well fitted by the first-order exponential and biexponential relaxation equations, respectively, as follows:14    where I1 and I2 are the steady-state current, A, B, t1, and t2 are the fitting constants, and τ1, τ2 and τ3 are the relaxation times. The relaxation times for the rise and decay edges are denoted by τr and τd, respectively. The τr for the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 hybrid DUVPD is 0.11 s. While for the decay process, it is noteworthy that two components (a fast and a slow-response component) work together to turn the photodetector off. The fast-response time τd1 and the slow-response time τd2 are 0.45 and 2.42 s, respectively. In contrast, τr and τd for the pure β-Ga2O3 DUVPD obtained using the first-order exponential relaxation equation were fitted to be 8.05 and 6.29 s, respectively. Especially, only the slow-response component dominates the decay process after removing the illumination. Obviously, the device decorated with the CH3NH3PbI3 film exhibits a superior switching-behavior enhancement. In addition, it is worth noting that the real response times of our fabricated DUVPDs can be further shortened, considering the intrinsic response time of the measurement system.

(c) and (d) are their corresponding rise and decay curves. The green and red lines are adopted to fit the rise and decay process, respectively. The illumination power density was 0.86 mW cm−2 in the measurement. 
The performance enhancement of the as-fabricated DUVPD based on the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 hybrid structure is remarkable. To understand the improvement of both the photoresponse and response speed of the device, the energy band diagram of the hybrid structure was analyzed. Generally, a simple Anderson model is employed to assist in the understanding of the carrier transport mechanism in organic materials based on heterostructures, especially in solar cells with multilayer structures.22,26,29,38 However, for the heterostructures with wide-bandgap semiconductors, a detailed energy band diagram including the Fermi level Ef should be taken into consideration to get a reasonable result. For this purpose, a β-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diode (SBD) was fabricated to determine the net donor concentration Nd of the substrate, as depicted in the inset of Fig. 4(a). The capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurement was performed at a frequency of 100 kHz, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The depletion-layer capacitance per unit area C of the SBD is expressed by39  where εr is the relative dielectric constant (the value of β-Ga2O3 is 10), ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, Vbi and VR are the built-in and reverse applied voltages across the diode, respectively. Fig. 4(b) plots the relationship between 1/C2 and the applied reverse voltage; the linearity in the 1/C2–V curve indicates the good Schottky contact between β-Ga2O3 and the Au electrode. ND was extracted to be 1.67 × 1017 cm−3 from the slope of the 1/C2–V curve. Taking mn* = 0.342 m0 (m0 is the free electron mass) as a reference, the difference of Ef − Ec of the β-Ga2O3 substrate was calculated to be −0.06 eV.40 These results are comparable with previous studies, verifying the rationality of our results.41 The bandgap Eg of β-Ga2O3 was fitted using the absorption spectrum and the Tauc equation, as shown in Fig. 4(c). The fitted bandgap of the β-Ga2O3 substrate is 4.67 eV. Based on these results, and combining with our previous studies on CH3NH3PbI3, the energy band diagram of the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 heterojunction is described in Fig. 4(d). The electronic affinity of CH3NH3PbI3 and β-Ga2O3 are 3.96 and 4.00 eV, respectively. A negligible conduction band offset ΔEc with a value of 0.04 eV appears at the interface, while the valence band offset ΔEv is calculated to be 2.97 eV (the bandgap Eg of CH3NH3PbI3 is 1.60 eV, ΔEv = ΔEg − ΔEc). Apparently, a typical type-II (staggered) heterojunction forms at the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 interface, which assists in the separation of the photo-induced carrier pairs.

For pure β-Ga2O3, a mass of electron–hole carrier pairs generate when it is illuminated with 254 nm light due to its superior photoelectric conversion efficiency. Single crystal β-Ga2O3 substrates with a perfect structure possess few defects to act as recombination centers. Besides, the holes in β-Ga2O3 with low mobility need a long transit time to transport across the device. What's more, the photogenerated electrons will be captured by oxygen vacancies that extensively exist in β-Ga2O3 and the releasing time is extremely long. As a result, all these factors make the pure β-Ga2O3 DUVPD need a very long recovery time to switch off. After decorated with the CH3NH3PbI3 film, the lifetime of the photo-induced carriers in β-Ga2O3 of the hybrid structure is extremely shortened due to the fast charge transport (the electrons flow to the β-Ga2O3 side, the holes flow to the CH3NH3PbI3 side) caused by the built-in electric field at the interface. In addition, the electron–hole diffusion lengths in solution-processed CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals with an ultra-long distance (175 μm) can further help the carrier transport.42 The photo-induced carrier lifetime is significantly shortened due to the fast charge transport at the interface, thus less recovery time is needed to switch the device off. A similar phenomenon has been observed in the CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO-nanowire hybrid structure, which can be attributed to the fast charge transport at the CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO interface.27
For a better comparison, a list of the critical parameters of DUVPDs based on the β-Ga2O3 heterojunction in this work and other previously reported studies is included in Table 2. Compared with other β-Ga2O3 heterojunction based DUVPDs, our device shows a moderate responsivity and response time; the superior PDCR indicates that the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 heterojunction based DUVPD has an excellent sensitivity for the DUV signal. In the future, our DUVPD can be further improved by optimizing the device size and fabrication process. Besides, integrating CH3NH3PbI3 on β-Ga2O3 has potential in the field of flexible and broadband photodetectors, which is attractive to the development of wearable devices and sensors.

Conclusion
In summary, a solar-blind photodetector based on a CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 heterojunction was developed via a facile and low-cost solution processing method. Compared with the pure β-Ga2O3 DUVPD, the performances of the PD based on the CH3NH3PbI3/β-Ga2O3 heterojunction were significantly enhanced. The photo-to-dark current ratio is 1460, the responsivity and detectivity are 85 mA W−1 and 1.28 × 1011 Jones, respectively. The device exhibits excellent reproducibility and stability under DUV light illumination, the rise and decay times are 0.11 and 0.45 s, respectively. These enhanced performances are attributed to the fast carrier transport due to the formation of the type-II heterojunction, as well as the long electron–hole diffusion lengths in CH3NH3PbI3. The critical parameters of our fabricated DUVPD are comparable with the recently reported DUVPDs based on the β-Ga2O3 heterojunction. The superior solar-blind/UVA rejection ratio (I254nm/I325nm) with a value of 221 indicates that our fabricated photodetector has an excellent sensitivity in the solar-blind region. We hope that this work can offer a new strategy to develop cheap and high-performance solar-blind photodetectors.
