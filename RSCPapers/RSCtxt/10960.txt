    , Accepted 12th March 2018First published on 12th March 2018AbstractHerein, by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we designed a new type of thiophene-linked porphyrin unit and incorporated it into an extended 2D conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) to serve as a CO2 reduction catalyst. This newly designed catalyst combines the advantages of molecular catalysis, heterogeneous catalysis, high structural stability and tunable electronic properties. A series of metal atoms (Fe, Mg, Mn, and Cu) were introduced into the center of the porphyrin ring to modify its capacity for reducing CO2. Our transition state (TS) search calculations revealed that the Fe-modified CMP possessed the highest catalytic activity toward CO2 reduction. The plausible reduction pathway was also determined. The band structure and frontier orbital distribution calculations further demonstrated its semimetallic property and higher stimulated transition probability, both of which are critical factors for photocatalytic performance. We hope that our design could provide meaningful guidance for other relevant CO2 catalytic reactions.
1. Introduction
The capture and conversion of CO2 by using solar energy are of great importance in alleviating the energy crisis and global warming currently encountered by humans.1 Numerous catalysts have been tested for CO2 reduction, such as TiO2, SrTiO3, BiVO4, BiWO6, and Zn2GeO4.2–6 The high recombination of electron–hole pairs, however, limits these materials’ reduction performance. Furthermore, since CO2 is quite stable with a bond energy of 750 kJ mol−1 CO, the photocatalytic reduction process must overcome a very high energetic and kinetic threshold, which has resulted in relatively low conversion efficiency until now.7 To address this challenge, the CO2 molecule needs to be activated efficiently. The activation methods can be divided into metal coordination activation, Lewis acid–base synergistic activation, photoelectric activation, enzyme catalytic activation, plasma activation and so on.8–11 With a combination of these methods and highly active, selective catalysts, the CO2 reduction reaction barrier can hopefully be lowered.
Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) have emerged as novel and promising candidates for CO2 applications.12,13 CMPs are unique owing to their large surface area, superior porosity, good chemical stability, and high flexibility in molecular structure design, pore parameters, and functionalization.14,15 Through appropriate design and construction of molecular building blocks, we can achieve a molecular-level control for chemical transformations catalyzed by CMPs without changing their topology.16–18 These characteristics make CMPs an excellent carrier for sensor devices, supercapacitors, catalysis and solar cells.19–24 Moreover, their ultrahigh porosity and surface area allow more active sites to be exposed to the reactants and eventually facilitate CO2 capture, concentration, storage and transport.25,26 Consequently, CMPs have aroused scientists’ extensive interest due to their easily tunable properties and potential for meeting various needs in CO2 conversion.
Porphyrins—tetrapyrrolic macrocycles—are vital natural organic compounds in the evolution and development of life and are widely used in dye-sensitized solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes and field effect transistors.27–29 Previous studies have shown the capacity of metalloporphyrin derivatives for photochemical and/or electrochemical activity in CO2 reduction catalysis homogeneously or heterogeneously.30–37 Hod et al. have incorporated Fe-porphyrin into MOF-525, which consists of meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCCP) linkers and hexa-zirconium nodes, to serve as a heterogeneous catalyst for CO2 electrochemical reduction in TBAPF6 acetonitrile solution at approximately −1.3 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) and the final chemical products are mixtures of CO and H2 with ∼100% Faradaic efficiency.7 Sadeghi et al. investigated CO2 photoreduction in the gas phase (H2O vapor as hydrogen source) under UV/Visible light at 100 °C by inserting zinc into the TCCP to serve as a ligand. The final reduction product of Zn-porphyrin-based photocatalyst is CH4 and the yield was 80.6% greater than that obtained using bare ZnO under the same reaction conditions.36 Furthermore, compared with three-dimensional CMPs, two-dimensional (2D) CMPs expose more active sites due to their reduced dimension, which drastically enhances catalytic efficiency. Considering the wide application of thiophehene and excellent cooperative performance of thiophene-linked porphyrin derivatives in dye-sensitized solar cells, herein, we chose thiophene as a linkage in the hope of further improving the electronic properties of this 2D CMP (i.e., light harvesting capacity and conductivity).23,29,38–41 Jiang et al. synthesized π-conjugated microporous polymer films of controllable thickness by means of the electropolymerization of thiophene-based monomers at the solution–electrode interface and the resultant CMP films were highly photoactive for photoenergy conversion.42 According to their investigations, the planar benzotrithiophene (BTT) CMP films have an optical band gap of 1.91 eV, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.02% and a hole mobility 7.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is the highest reported value for π-conjugated microporous polymers measured under the same technique.
Herein, inspired by the great advantages of 2D CMPs and the promising catalytic activity of metalloporphyrin derivatives toward CO2 cycles, we designed a new type of 2D CMP and predicted its catalytic performance in CO2 reduction reactions. This newly designed 2D CMP consists of metalloporphyrin building blocks and thiophene bridges. The metalloporphyrin was incorporated into the CMP mainly to serve as a structural and functional unit. Our calculations indicated that this highly conjugated microporous polymer was quite stable under ambient conditions. We further modified the electronic properties of the metalloporphyrin CMPs by introducing metal atoms (Fe, Mg, Mn, and Cu) into the center of the porphyrin ring. The most active catalyst among these is the Fe modified thiophene-linked metalloporphyrin (Fe-TMP). The possible CO2 reduction mechanisms have also been computed and discussed. We expect our work to offer a new insight into the design of metalloporphyrin based 2D CMP structures and their properties, particularly the property of higher catalytic activity for CO2 reduction.
2. Computational methods and models construction
All of the spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out by the DMol3 code of Materials Studio software.43,44 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation interactions were implemented inside a generalized gradient approximation (GGA).45 The Grimme empirical dispersion correction scheme was adopted to appropriately describe the weak van der Waals interactions.46 The density functional semi-core pseudopotential (DSPP) was employed in view of the relativistic effects of transition metal atoms Furthermore, to accelerate our computations, since the core electrons were substituted with a single effective potential.47 The basis set was double-numerical atomic orbital plus polarization function (DNP).48 The self-consistent field (SCF) was determined with a convergence tolerance of 1.0 × 10−6 Ha (1 Ha = 27.21 eV) for the total electronic energy and geometry optimization calculations. To improve SCF convergence efficiency, a smearing value of 0.005 Ha was employed to the orbital occupation for all of the calculations. The real-space global orbital cutoff radius was chosen as 4.5 Å to ensure accuracy of the results. A vacuum around 20 Å was set to avoid interactions between the periodic images. The Brillouin zone was sampled with 2 × 2 × 1 k-points since a harsh 5 × 5 × 1 k-point grid generated nearly the same results in geometry and total energy. First-principles molecular dynamic (MD) calculations were conducted to test the structural thermal stability at 300 K under the canonical ensemble (NVT). Population analysis was achieved by assigning Hirshfeld charges on the optimized slabs.49 The adsorption energy (Eads) of adsorbed species was defined as Eads = Etotal − ECMP − Espe, where Etotal is the total energy of the species adsorbed onto adsorption substrate (CMP) and ECMP and Espe are the energies of the CMP substrate and the isolated species, respectively. According to this equation, a negative Eads indicates an energetically stable configuration. The reduction reaction mechanisms proposed by Nørskov et al. and supplemented by other researchers were referred and tested.32,36,50–55 Sadeghi et al. have illuminated the realizability of CO2 photoreduction in gas phase using similar CMP catalysts.36 Other relevant studies have also confirmed this result. Hence, we mainly studied the CO2 photoreduction performance of our newly designed CMP catalysts in gas phase. The transition state (TS) of the reductive reaction was obtained by linear synchronous transit/quadratic synchronous transit (LST/QST) algorithm in DMol3 code.56 The activation barrier (Ea) is defined as Ea = ETS − EIS, where ETS and EIS are the energies of transition structures and initial structures, respectively.
We mainly focused on the situation where thiophene shares its α- and β-carbons with the two β-carbons of pyrrole, which results in the formation of a 2D monolayer ordered porous planar material. Another situation where thiophene shares its α-carbon with the meso-carbon of porphyrin was omitted herein since this would lead to a complicated spatial reticular structure. The bridging function of the thiophene moiety endows us with more freedom to adjust the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of 2D CMPs. For instance, we can conveniently employ oligothiophene as a linkage between the two interconnected porphyrins to control the measurement of the nanometer-sized pores outside the porphyrin rings and therefore achieve an optimal configuration. Initially we constructed a thiophene-linked porphyrin (TP) unit to test its stability and to serve as a precursor for the construction of the TMP unit cell. Then, metal atoms such as Fe, Mg, Mn and Cu were introduced into the porphyrin center by replacing the central two H atoms inside the center of porphyrin ring to modify its electronic properties.
3. Results and discussion
The optimized 2D geometric structures of Fe-TMP are shown in Fig. 1a. This crystal unit cell belongs to a tetragonal system with P4/M space group and its cell parameters are a = b = 14.48 Å. Our first-principles MD simulations manifested that the fluctuation of potential energy of the TP unit or Fe-TMP unit cell was no more than 0.2 eV per unit at 300 K within 1 ps and there is no distinct structural breakage in the frameworks. These results indicate that the TP unit can exist alone stably and the introduction of metal atoms has no distinct effects on the CMP framework. Thus, this newly designed CMP is quite stable at room temperature. The introduction of Mg, Mn and Cu atoms gives a similar result and all the MD related data can be found in Fig. S1 (ESI†).

Frontier orbital distribution calculations were conducted to study electron occupancy and predict photocatalytic performance. As shown in Fig. 1b, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is only composed of 3d orbitals of the Fe atom. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (Fig. 1c) mainly consists of 2p orbitals of C atoms and 4p orbitals of the Fe atom (antibonding π orbital, πp*). The Fe atom could serve as the electron donor, while the electron acceptor could be the central Fe atom or the C atoms. The computed HOMO and LUMO levels of the pure CMP are −5.19 and −3.33 eV, respectively, which corresponds to a band gap of 1.86 eV. This result is similar to that reported by Jiang et al. regarding the BTT-CMP, whose HOMO and LUMO levels measured through electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) were −5.32 and −3.32 eV, respectively, which corresponds to an electrochemical band gap of 2.00 eV.42 The computed HOMO and LUMO levels of the Fe-CMP were −4.60 and −4.07 eV, respectively, which corresponds to a band gap of 0.53 eV. It is known that the decrease in the band gap can significantly increase the range of the absorption spectrum of a semiconductor and therefore enhance its stimulated transition probability. Jiang et al. illustrated the excellent photoenergy conversion efficiency of BTT-CMP in a solar cell system. Thus, when illuminated by UV/Visible light, the Fe-CMP could also exhibit high photoenergy absorption efficiency. The overlap of HOMO and LUMO orbitals in the central Fe atom could also make the electron transition much easier when compared to pure CMP, Mg-CMP, Mn-CMP and Cu-CMP (see Fig. S2, ESI†). In addition to connecting with Fe-porphyrin units, the thiophene linkage contributed to the LUMO of Fe-CMP, that is, the photogenerated electrons can transfer to the nearby Fe-TP unit conveniently along the thiophene linkage. Band structures of these periodic slabs were computed with the same parameters as stated above except for employing harsher 12 × 12 × 1 k-point grids. It is noteworthy that the PBE function would generally underestimate the band gap and therefore leads to some inappropriate analytic results, but the trend in the band gap analysis is credible. The Fe-CMP is semimetallic with a negligible band gap, while the pure CMP is semiconductive. Detailed analysis of these band structures was not performed in this study. However, all the band structure data is given for reference in the ESI† (see Fig. S3 and Table S1).
Then, we investigated CO2 adsorption on the Fe-TMP surface as this is the first step to initialize the reduction reaction and it plays an important part in the following reaction pathway. The coordination of C and O atoms or CO bond with the central Fe2+ atom was taken into consideration and an initial placement scheme of 2, 2.5 and 3 Å distances was employed for each configuration. After full geometric relaxation, we found two energetically favorable structures: the side-on configuration (Fig. 2a) and the end-on configuration (Fig. 2b). The Hirshfeld charges of the C atom of the isolated CO2 is 0.296, while that of both the adsorbed side-on CO2 and end-on CO2 are 0.297 (see Table 1). The C–O bond length of CO2 before and after adsorption is almost unchanged (∼1.176 Å). No distinct changes in bond length or electrons are detected in these two cases, indicating that CO2 was physically adsorbed on the substrate at the beginning. Since the LUMO of CO2 is an antibonding orbital, electron transfer would weaken the C–O bond.57 Therefore, the initial reduction of catalyst can activate the CO2 molecule efficiently and then, the CO2 molecule can be reduced to the anion adduct CO2−. The protonation of the anion adduct CO2− is easier than that of CO2. However, on introducing an extra electron to reduce Fe2+ to Fe+ and then testing the generation of anion adduct CO2−, the adsorbed CO2 molecule remains unchanged, while the extra electron is still localized in the central Fe atom and the direct geometric optimization of the CO2− configuration always failed or fell back into the Fe2+ and CO2 state. This result is consistent with that reported by Shen et al., confirming that the charged CO2 adduct is not stable without solvation35 and hence, CO2 cannot be reduced to CO2− directly.

The formation of carboxyl (COOH) and formate (HCOO) groups were both considered when the first H atom (reduction product from vapor H2O) was added into the system to initialize CO2 hydrogenation. According to our computations, the introduced H atom tends to be first adsorbed onto the pyrrole N atom with adsorption energy of −1.54 eV and then, the adsorbed CO2 can be protonated with the assistance of H atom under the catalysis of Fe-CMP. In addition, the COOH* (the asterisk (*) denotes Fe-TMP substrate) configuration is thermodynamically more stable than that of HCOO* (Fig. 3a) and only a 0.94 eV barrier has to be overcome to realize conversion as compared to the considerable 1.57 eV barrier for HCOO* (Fig. 3b). These two points indicate that the COOH transformation pathway is preferred. The higher catalytic performance of CO2 to COOH can be ascribed to an excellent ability to coordinate the transfer of electrons and H atoms during the reaction process. The CO2 molecule was activated into a bent configuration with ∠OCO = 143.59 °C at the TS state (Fig. 3a). This configuration is similar to that of CO2−, which can be protonated easily as mentioned above. However, the pathway from CO2* to HCOO* does not go through a CO2−-like state during the reaction. Instead, this reaction is triggered by the H-shuttling from the Fe-CMP substrate to CO2 directly. Nie et al. have conducted DFT studies for CO2 hydrogenation to methane (CH4) on Cu(111) surface and calculated the activation barrier for COOH to be 1.31 eV in gas phase at −0.65 V versus the relative hydrogen electrode (RHE); they concluded that H-shuttling would be difficult without the assistance of H2O solvent.58 As a result, the HCOO pathway is suppressed in gas phase.

It is known that the first step of CO2 hydrogenation is the rate-determining step for the overall reaction.7,33 Hence, we substituted the central Fe atom with Mg, Mn, and Cu atom and tested the catalytic performance of each of the modified catalysts towards CO2 reduction under the same conditions. Their energy barriers along the two different reaction pathways are shown in Fig. 3c and the specific reaction coordinates are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Since no barriers smaller than 0.94 eV are observed, we can say that Fe-TMP demonstrates the best catalytic activity for CO2 first step reduction and thus, the Fe-TMP was used to carry out the following photoreduction reactions.
Large adsorption energy is beneficial for the catalyst to capture the related reactants, but excess adsorption energy would hinder any subsequent reaction. The large Eads of COOH and HCOO intermediates (−2.24 eV for COOH and −2.05 eV for HCOO, see Table 1) demonstrates that a stable formate or carboxylate is formed by coordinating with the central Fe atom, which may prohibit the next photoreduction reactions. However, when the H atom is adsorbed by the Fe-CMP substrate, these stable configurations may undergo some small changes. Kumari et al. have proposed a method to estimate the interaction between the adsorbed hydrogen atom and intermediates by analyzing the adsorption energy difference between the co-adsorbed and individually adsorbed species on the substrate.59 The adsorption energy difference (ΔEads/AED) is defined as ΔEads/AED = Eads/(COOH–H)* − Eads/COOH* − Eads/H*, where Eads/(COOH–H)* is the adsorption energy of co-adsorbed (COOH–H), Eads/COOH* is the adsorption energy of the individually adsorbed COOH intermediate, and Eads/H* is the adsorption energy of the individually adsorbed H atom. The adsorption energy of (COOH–H) was calculated to be −4.20 eV and the sum of the adsorption energies of the individual COOH intermediate (−2.24 eV) and H atom (−1.54 eV) is −3.78 eV; hence, ΔEads/AED is −0.42 eV. Consequently, the interaction between COOH and H would weaken the handicap of the excessively large adsorption energy of COOH during the reaction. The fact that a relatively small barrier needs to be surmounted for the subsequent transformation of COOH has confirmed this assumption. The ΔEads/AED value between the co-adsorbed energy (−4.16 eV) and individually adsorbed energy of HCOO is −0.57 eV, which is similar to that of COOH. The following interaction of co-adsorbed species was neglected as they had the same tendency. Moreover, in order to test whether COOH* could adsorb an extra H atom, the energy difference ΔEenergy between co-adsorbed (COOH–H)*, COOH*, and H atom was computed based on ΔEenergy = E(COOH-H)* − ECOOH* − EH and ΔEenergy was computed to be −1.96 eV, which confirms that it is possible for COOH* to adsorb an extra H atom. Similarly, for HCOO*, ΔEenergy was computed to be −2.11 eV, indicating that HCOO* could also adsorb an extra H atom.
The subsequently adsorbed H atoms may interact with these chemisorbed intermediates and generate formic acid (HCOOH) or CO. All the COOH* → CO*, COOH* → HCOOH*, HCOO* → HCOOH* pathways were taken into consideration. The HCOO* → CO* pathway was ruled out since this elementary step involves the breakage of C–H and C–O bonds simultaneously, which would significantly increase the transformation threshold. Among these transformations, the reduction of COOH to CO is energetically preferred and only has to surmount a 0.20 eV barrier, while the reduction of COOH to HCOOH has to surmount a 0.35 eV barrier. The Fe-TMP substrate exhibits a strong adsorption ability for CO (−1.59 eV, Table 1), which is beneficial to the subsequent reduction reaction. Wang et al. have conducted DFT studies for CO2 electroreduction on single transition metal atom supported porphyrin-like graphene (TMN4/graphene); the various optimized geometric structures of our intermediates are similar to those reported in their study.60 On CoN4/graphene, RhN4/graphene, and IrN4/graphene, the adsorption energies of CO are −0.97, −1.00 and −1.24 eV, respectively, and the corresponding TM-C distances are 1.80 Å, 1.89 Å and 1.85 Å, respectively. On the other reaction pathway, even a small barrier of 0.32 eV has to be overcome to transform HCOO to HCOOH. The relatively high barrier for the generation of HCOO in the first step prohibits this process and hence, only a small amount of HCOOH is produced. Furthermore, the positive Eads of HCOOH demonstrates a strong desorption tendency. From the above results, we can conclude that the two-step reduction product of CO2 is mainly CO, while HCOOH is released to the environment as a minor side product after the reduction of COOH.
Then, we focused on the subsequent hydrogenation of CO to CH4. Through interacting with H atom and coordinating with central Fe atom, both the HCO* and COH* intermediates can be formed. Based on the study reported by Wang et al.,60 the CO* → COH* pathway was highly energetically unfavorable; thus, this pathway was omitted. HCO* is adsorbed on top of the Fe atom at 1.89 Å distance from the substrate. The barrier of the hydrogenation of CO* to HCO* is 0.39 eV; thus, this step easily occurs. In the next hydrogenation step, the adsorbed HCO* can be reduced to HCOH* or H2CO*. The former pathway had a thermodynamically negligible barrier of 0.07 eV which illustrates that this process is extremely easy, while the latter had a considerable barrier of 1.46 eV. Subsequently, both HCOH* and H2CO* can be reduced to H2COH* through interaction with H atom, but the former easily occurs with a barrier of 0.31 eV. Moreover, all attempts to search the TS state of the H2CO* → H3CO* pathway failed, which may indicate that this transformation step was rather difficult to occur under the catalysis of Fe-CMP. Consequently, the following reduction reactions of H3CO* to methanol (CH3OH) or CH4 were ruled out. Subsequently, H2COH* adsorbed on the Fe atom will be hydrogenated with the assistance of another H atom. The activation barrier of the H3CO* → H3COH* pathway is 0.44 eV. The relatively large adsorption energy of the adsorbed CH3OH species (−0.71 eV) indicates that desorption of CH3OH will be difficult. Sadeghi et al., Izumi et al., and Karamian et al. have confirmed the H3COH* → CH3* → CH4* pathway for the photoreduction of H3COH to CH4.36,50,55 Hence, we further studied the reduction of the H3COH species to the CH4 species. The adsorbed H3COH* can be reduced to CH3* with the help of the adsorbed H atom and the activation barrier for this step is 0.60 eV. Finally, the formed CH3* species can be reduced to CH4* with another H atom. The activation barrier of this step is 0.15 eV. The adsorption energy of CH4 on Fe-TMP is −0.27 eV, which is beneficial to the subsequent desorption of CH4. As a result, once the CH4 species are formed, they can be removed from the substrate easily. The other CO2 molecules can be adsorbed onto the Fe-CMP substrate and a renewed reduction reaction can occur. All the intermediates involved in the CO2 reduction as mentioned above are illustrated in Fig. 3d and the overall reaction pathway is illustrated in Fig. 3e; the thread reactions are energetically preferred processes and the branches are some possible side reactions.
4. Conclusions
In summary, under the framework of spin-polarized DFT calculations, we systematically investigated the potential of metal atom (Fe, Mg, Mn and Cu) tuned thiophene-linked porphyrin units within an extended 2D CMP as a CO2 reduction catalyst. Our calculations indicated that this newly designed 2D CMP framework is quite stable under ambient environment and Fe-CMP shows the best catalytic performance. The carboxyl pathway is the thermodynamically preferred reduction process, in which the final reduction product is methane and formic acid is the side product. We hope that this novel catalyst can be used widely in other catalytic applications, which require both molecular-level control and heterogeneous catalysis. We also hope that our design concept provides useful reference for the fabrication of more efficient catalysts.
