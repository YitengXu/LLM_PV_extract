Not only is paper highly abundant and portable, it is lightweight, disposable, easy-to-use, and can be rolled or folded into 3D configurations. More importantly, with a unique porous bulk structure and rough and absorptive surface properties, the construction of nanomaterials-functionalized cellulose has enabled cellulose paper to be applied for point-of-care (POC) paper devices with reasonably good performance at low cost. In this review, the latest advances in the modification of nanomaterials on paper cellulose are summed up. To begin with, the attractive properties of paper-based analytical devices are described. Then, fabricating methods for the functionalization of cellulose with diverse materials, including noble metals, bimetals, metal oxides, carbon nanomaterials, and molecular imprinting polymer nanoparticles, as well as their applications, are introduced in detail. Finally, the current critical issues, challenges, and future prospectives for exploring a paper-based analytical system based on nanomaterials-modified cellulose are discussed. It is believed that more strategies will be developed in the future to construct nanomaterials-functionalized cellulose, paving the way for the mass production of POC paper devices with a satisfactory performance.
1. Introduction
Paper has attracted increased attention in recent years as an ideal platform for constructing portable miniature diagnostic devices, which are especially valuable for developing countries, resource-limited environments, and point-of-care settings.1–5 Paper has a lot of intriguing features that render this substrate advantageous for conducting chemical and biological analyses, such as the passive transport of fluids through capillary wicking,6,7 good biocompatibility and biodegradability, and so forth. Besides, paper-based devices are being increasingly utilized due to the following merits: (i) Paper is abundant and affordable. (ii) Paper substrates possess a porous structure, facilitating the immobilization of sensing materials and the diffusion of analytes.8 Furthermore, the surface of cellulose paper can be modified with diverse functional groups to conjugate proteins,9,10 DNA,11–14 and other molecules.15–17 (iii) A large surface-to-volume ratio is offered, allowing for sufficient reagent storage. (iv) Paper can be easily patterned by traditional photolithography processes,18 inkjet printing,19 wax printing,20 or screen printing methods for mass production.21 (v) Paper-based models are feasibly foldable to form ramose or multilaminate microfluidic channels for multiplexing22–24 and 3D-framing25–27 with flexible fluidic control. (vi) Paper-related devices are disposable by an incinerator because of its combustibility.28 (vii) Paper-based devices tend to be easy to transport and apply due to them typically being thin, lightweight, and flexible. Founded on such distinct merits, paper has been widely used in various fields.29 For example, disposable paper devices can be applied in biomedicine,10,30,31 environmental control,32–34 and personal monitoring devices.35,36 However, there are a variety of scientific and engineering barriers to the large-scale adoption of next-generation paper-based analytical devices, and these have stimulated tremendous research in this field.15 The latest advances in microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) extend their application in the biosensing field37–39via fluorescence,40,41 chemiluminescence,42,43 electrochemical,12,44 electrochemiluminescence,45,46 and photoelectrochemical,47,48 and colorimetric methods.49,50
Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices are critical for identifying and measuring the quantity of analytes in a variety of environments that lack access to laboratory infrastructure.51–53 So, one of the great challenges in science and engineering today is the development of simple, portable, affordable, yet highly sensitive and specific POC technologies for quantitative detection. Such a capability could streamline healthcare and improve clinical outcomes, substantially improving the standard of living.39,52,54,55 Paper has emerged as a cheap, universal, and scalable platform for POC assays, with μPADs as a central format.1,2,56–59 The functionalization of cellulose materials has the potential to extend the functionality and application field of μPADs in the development of new sensing devices.60,61 The integration of nanomaterials into paper clearly enhances the detection capabilities.13 In the past few years, we have witnessed the integration of μPADs with functional nanomaterials, such as noble metals, bimetals, metal oxides, carbon nanomaterials, and molecular imprinting polymers (Fig. 1).62,63 All of these possess distinctive properties, improving the performance of μPADs and broadening their application fields significantly (Table 1).64

The nanoscale endows materials with remarkable changes in properties, resulting in strengthened performance and even distinctive functionalities.89–92 To enhance the performance of μPADs and to meet specific requirements during applications, the surface of the cellulose of μPADs may be modified with nanomaterials, which has been confirmed to be an effective strategy.93,94 A large variety of functional and well-designed architectures have been successfully fabricated via employing specific strategies.80,95,96 These composites demonstrated particular optical, electronic, physical, chemical, or biological properties compared with free nanomaterial counterparts and have vast potential for various applications.60 Paper substrates possess a porous structure, which facilitates the immobilization of sensing materials and the diffusion of analytes.97 Nanomaterials are mainly used to construct the sensing interface in μPADs, serving as static sensing elements. Leveraging nanomaterials for active transport in paper would enable an advanced control of target analytes, extending the current molecular diagnostic capabilities of paper-based devices.13 In this article, we summarize the common strategies for cellulose functionalization with nanomaterials (Table 2) and their applications in biosensors based on the vast amount of research results available.

2. Modification of noble metal nanomaterials on paper cellulose
To improve the performance of μ-PADs, and ensure sufficient efficiency and sensitivity of the reactions in the application of μPADs, a good few noble metal nanomaterials are used to modify the cellulose. Noble metal nanomaterials possess superior optical, electrochemical, and chemical properties. Consequently, noble-metal-nanomaterials-modified cellulose μPADs are widely used in the fields of optics and electrochemical sensors.111–113 In addition, the agglomeration of noble metal nanomaterials may noticeably reduce their efficiency in solution. Noble nanomaterials are immobilized on the surface of cellulose as a scaffold to enhance the conductivity and biocompatibility. As an ideal scaffold, a large surface area and strong interaction with noble metal nanomaterials are essential. Adopting ample cellulose as a scaffold for metals can be a feasible means to sustain their high activities. Currently, the strategies of modifying celluloses with noble metal nanomaterials are subjected to post-immobilization as well as to the in situ growth on cellulose substrates. For post-immobilization methods, a high dispersity and uniformity of the noble metal nanomaterials are vital. Surface pretreatment is usually employed to introduce bonds between noble metals and substrates.114 The in situ growth approach is greatly influence by various factors that should be precisely controlled, including the type and concentration of the metal precursor and reducing agent, the type of solvent, temperature, time, and so forth. To yield anchoring sites for the noble metal precursor growth and for control the structure of the produced noble metal nanoparticles, certain chemical promoters or surfactants are usually used simultaneously.60
Much attention has been paid to enhance the conductivity and immobilization of bio-recognition substances on cellulose for the signal amplification of paper-based assays. Au NPs have attracted much attention in the immobilization of cellulose due to their distinctive physical and chemical properties, such as easily controllable size distribution, superior conductivity, long-term stability, and biocompatibility.99,115 In view of the above merits, our group reported that Au nanoparticles could grow on the surface of cellulose in the form of an interconnected Au NPs layer. Au-nanoparticles-modified cellulose served as a PWE on compatibly designed μ-PADs to enhance the conductivity of the paper. In the process, the suspension of Au seeds was first prepared by using NaBH4 as a reductant and then stabilized with sodium citrate, such that a Au NPs layer further grew on the surface of the Au NP seeded cellulose in a growth aqueous solution of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing HAuCl4, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, and H2O2. As shown in Fig. 2, there was no apparent structure and surface difference between bare and Au NPs-seeded cellulose due to the small particle size of the Au seeds. With the increment of reaction time, the Au seeds were rapidly enlarged by incubating in the growth solution under a self-catalytic reduction mechanism. Finally, a continuous and dense conducting Au NPs layer was obtained on the cellulose surfaces after 10 min of growth. Due to the high specific surface area and porous structure of paper, the resulting Au NPs layer on the cellulose possessed a higher effective surface area. Correspondingly, the porous Au-PWE when used for immobilizing bio-recognition molecules revealed an enhanced sensitivity over that of the bare electrode (unmodified PWE).44,65,116 In terms of simplicity and cost efficiency, inkjet printing is very competitive over other existing methods. Hu et al. reported a simple approach to produce batches of nanoporous gold electrode arrays on cellulose membranes by inkjet printing.117 Such an approach could fabricate hundreds of self-designed gold arrays on cellulose membranes within several hours. The resulting paper-based gold electrode arrays had several unique properties as thin-film sensor platforms, including good conductivity, excellent flexibility, high integration, and low cost. The present work thus demonstrates the promising applications of paper-based porous electrode arrays in electrochemical gas sensing.

On the basis of the same mechanism, our group also fabricated Ag NPs on the surface of the cellulose of μPADs.101 Porous Ag NPs were achieved by adjusting the growth of Ag NPs layer from Ag seeds to Ag NPs on the surface of cellulose in the paper, which further immobilized capture antibodies through chemical absorption between Ag NPs and –NH2 groups of the capture antibody (Fig. 3). Thanks to the high specific surface area and porous structure of paper and the good conductivity of porous Ag NPs, the sensitivity of the as-designed μPADs was remarkably improved.

Ag NPs-modified paper cellulose can also serve as a bioactive substrate for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection. Singamaneni and co-workers reported SERS paper substrates impregnated with gold nanorods by dip coating.62,119,120 Yu reported a highly sensitive SERS substrate on paper by inkjet printing using a cheap inkjet printer.121,122 The functional sensing regions were hydrophobic. Subsequently, the as-prepared Ag NPs were printed onto these regions to form sensing arrays. The hydrophobic surface deterred the aqueous sample from diffusing all over the paper and thus concentrated the analyte within the sensing region. The as-proposed paper-based SERS substrates, with vitally low cost and simplicity of fabrication, may facilitate their application in routine labs as well as POC. For technology application in the real world, it should meet the demands for low cost and easy operation. Polavarapu et al. presented a “pen-on paper” (POP) approach for making SERS substrates.123 As shown in Fig. 4(a, e and g), Au NPs and Au nanorods were uniform in dimension, whereas Ag NPs showed a polydispersity, including Ag nanorods. The three different inks were deposited on cellulose with fountain pens filled with the corresponding nanoparticles. The morphology of the SERS substrate could be easily controlled, and the results are presented in Fig. 4 using three different inks. It was shown that the nanoparticles were compactly packed and adsorbed onto the surface of cellulose, so they were anticipated to produce intense SERS signals. Via this approach, no professional training was required to fabricate nanomaterials-modified cellulose for SERS arrays on paper using an ordinary fountain pen filled with inks comprising metal nanomaterials of an arbitrary shape and size.

Recently, Nishikata et al. investigated the modification of Pd NPs on filter paper based on electrostatic interactions.124 Zheng et al. reported that a novel catalytic system based on Pd NPs loaded on cellulose was established with high efficiency and recyclability. Paper as a scaffold for Pd NPs-based catalysts was explored for diverse chemical reactions. The main benefits of the resulting catalytic material were its simplified handling and easy recovery. The catalyst was prepared through the templated assembly of oleylamine-stabilized Pd nanoparticles on cellulose filter paper.125 Furthermore, Pt NPs were chosen as a biocompatible nanomaterial due to their superior conductivity, strong absorption ability, bioactivity, and stability of immobilizing biomolecules.126–128 Yu's group reported the fabrication of Pt-nanoparticles-modified cellulose.67 First, a Pt seeds solution was dropped onto the bare PWE and equilibrated at ambient temperature for 1 h. Then, an interconnected Pt nanoparticles layer was grown on the cellulose through a Pt seeds growth strategy in the sample zone of PWE. Using the as-prepared Pt-PWE as a sensing platform, the in situ and real-time determination of H2O2 was successfully achieved by highly affinitive binding with aptamers for capturing SK-BR-3 cancer cells (Fig. 5).68

3. Modification of bimetal nanomaterials on paper cellulose
Bimetal nanoparticles, including alloy and core–shell nanoparticles, have attracted tremendous attention due to their strikingly electronic, optical, magnetic, and catalytic properties in comparison with their monometallic counterparts. They have been widely applied in the field of catalysis, sensors, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering.129–132 As one of the most abundant materials that is truly ubiquitous in modern society, cellulose is an ideal substrate for the assembly and immobilization of bimetal nanoparticles, which could not only offer better stability and easier recyclability of bimetal nanoparticles, but also an increase in their performance, thus making the application of bimetal-nanoparticles-modified cellulose popular in various fields.
Recently, our group developed a facile method to prepare Au@Pt NPs-modified cellulose (Fig. 6I). Au@Pt NPs as catalysts showed a dramatically higher reaction rate compared to pure Au and Pt NPs. The catalytic activity depended on the chemical composition of the bimetal nanoparticles, which demonstrated a strong synergistic effect between Au and Pt.78,133 The fabrication of the Au@Pt nanoparticles was as follows. A Au seed solution was first dropped into the specific zone of the paper device. The paper was equilibrated for 2 h, followed by washing with Milli-Q water. A freshly prepared growth aqueous solution of PBS containing HAuCl4 and H2PtCl6 was dropped into the Au-seeded PWE. By controlling the ratio of HAuCl4 and H2PtCl6, Au@Pt nanoparticles with different ratios could be obtained. Subsequently, the resulting Au@Pt-PWE was washed with Milli-Q water thoroughly, and dried at room temperature. An interconnected Au@Pt nanoparticles layer was in situ grown on the surfaces of cellulose to build conductivity-enhanced PWE on an origami photoelectrochemical device (Fig. 6II), which was utilized for the real-time visual determination of H2S released from multiple cancer cells for the first time.72 Ge et al. also reported zinc oxide nanorods (ZNRs) grown on a Au@Pt-nanoparticles-modified PWE via an in situ growth method. The ZNRs/Au@Pt-PWE resulted in an enhanced excitation and photo-to-electric conversion efficiency. As a consequence, amplified photocurrent signals were achieved. Eventually, the invented immunodevice was successfully applied for the monitoring of carcinoembryonic antigen and α-fetoprotein (Fig. 6III).

The properties of bimetal nanomaterials not only depend on their size and shape, but also on their composition and structure.134,135 Special attention has been paid to the preparation of bimetallic nanoparticles with highly dendritic/porous structures. Owing to their high surface area and rich surface atoms, dendritic/porous nanostructures are favorable for high catalytic performance. Porous Au@Pd nanoparticles were synthesized by an in situ growth strategy. Utilizing the cellulose as a scaffold, not only was a conductivity-enhanced PWE obtained, but also the as-prepared bimetallic nanoparticles exhibited excellent peroxidases-like catalytic activity (Fig. 7I). The fabrication of Au@Pd-PWE can be described as follows. First, a Au seed solution was dropped into the PWE. Then, the paper-based device was equilibrated at room temperature for 1 h. After rinsing with water thoroughly to eliminate unbound Au seeds, the Au-seeded PWE was immersed in the growth solution containing HAuCl4 and H2PdCl4. Ascorbic acid solution was then added quickly under gentle shaking. Finally, the resulting Au@Pd-PWE was rinsed with water thoroughly and dried at ambient temperature.48,73 When utilizing the as-prepared bimetallic nanomaterial to construct the sensing platform (Fig. 7II), not only was the immobilization of antibodies increased, but also the detection response was amplified, which was ascribed to the catalase-like catalytic activity of dendritic Au@Pd NPs. The sensitivity of the sensing platform with Au@Pd-PWE was much higher than that of a bare one (unmodified PWE) or that of monometallic counterparts, because of the high specific surface area and the porous structure as well as the high conductivity of the Au@Pd NPs. In addition, Au@Pd NPs demonstrated superior catalytic activity and electron transfer. To evaluate the reliability of the proposed Au@Pd NPs-modified cellulose, CEA in human serum samples was used for the practical assay. Interestingly, the designed bimetallic-NPs-based sensing platform could be easily extended for monitoring other targets and has the potential for the reliable diagnosis of cancer and other diseases.

4. Modification of metal oxide nanomaterials on paper cellulose
The application of metal oxides prevails in various fields. Utilizing metal oxide nanoparticles to modify cellulose extends the application of paper-based analytical devices. Metal-oxides-coated cellulose not only exhibit better stability and easier recyclability but also enhanced performance of paper analytical devices. As an ideal scaffold, cellulose possesses rich surface OH groups and an intrinsic porous nanostructure. Cellulose–metal oxide composites combine the processability of cellulose and the superior performances of metal oxide materials. To fabricate cellulose–metal oxide composites, it is critical that the surface of the cellulose substrate is lined with inorganic ions. So far, much research has been dedicated to fabricating cellulose–metal oxide composites with different metal oxides, including TiO2,136 ZnO,137 Fe3O4,138 CuO,139 ZnO–SiO2.140 Similar to many other composites, the homogeneous dispersion of metal oxide nanoparticles over cellulose is a great challenge owning to the aggregation of metal oxide nanomaterials in the synthesis process, which severely affects the performances of the obtained composites. To address this issue, various strategies have been exploited to fabricate metal–oxide-nanoparticles-modified cellulose with high dispersity. Metal oxides are immobilized on cellulose scaffold generally in two ways. One is a two-step process, in which to manipulate the nanoparticle size and morphology of metal oxide over cellulose, it is better to prepare monodisperse nanoparticles first and assemble these nanoparticles onto cellulose materials subsequently. The other is in situ growth, which can guarantee a strong cellulose–metal oxide interaction in cellulose–metal oxide composites. This method usually demands a high temperature and high-pressure environment for nanoparticle nucleation and growth on cellulose.
The immobilization of metal oxide nanoparticles onto a cellulose substrate has drawn wide interest academically and industrially. These composites have shown some distinguished performances, such as antibacterial,141–143 photocatalysis,144–146 and as a sensor.142,147,148 For instance, El-Naggar et al. reported that TiO2 nanoparticles were in situ deposited onto cellulose without severely destroying the cellulose.149 Urea nitrate was first used as a peptizing agent to transform titanium hydroxide to TiO2 nanoparticles. It was found that the TiO2 nanoparticles coated on cellulose were composed of aggregated particles with an average size of less than 50 nm. Interestingly, TiO2 NPs-coated cellulose showed a bacterial reduction of more than 95%, which was tenable even after 20 washing cycles; furthermore, the bacterial reduction was increased by the addition of urea nitrate. These treated celluloses performed well in bacterial reduction and ultraviolet visible protection regardless of washing.149 Gullapalli et al. prepared zinc oxide nanostructures embedded in a stable matrix of paper (cellulose) by a solvothermal method for sensing strain under both static and dynamic loading.150 Here, the nanostructured ZnO was crystallized in the matrix by immersing a seed-layer-coated paper substrate in an aqueous solution of a precursor and a solvent maintained at low temperature, generally less than 100 °C.93 To evaluate the strain sensing capabilities of ZnO paper, the ZnO paper was attached to a brass beam, and its response to a change in strain was measured by monitoring the output current. The ZnO paper strain sensor showed a shift in current output at different strain levels. Metal oxide nanoparticles were grown only on the paper fibers exposed on the surface of the paper, which served primarily as an inert substrate to sustain the growth of active nanostructures.
Zhang et al. prepared ZnO-nanorods-immobilized paper substrates by a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method for the construction of a paper-based ZnO nanorods inorganic–organic heterostructured light-emitting diode (LED) (Fig. 8I). A silver electrode was first screen-printed on a bare paper (unmodified paper) to offer a smooth surface for the subsequent growth of ZnO NRs and served as a back contact before the PLD was carried out. Subsequently, it was polished until the surface changed into smooth and shiny. Then, it was washed several times by Milli-Q water and dried, and the paper cellulose was deposited with a ∼100 nm thick ZnO seed layer that provided nucleation sites for the growth of ZnO nanorods.77 As a proof-of-concept, the proposed LED was used as an excitation light source to construct an advanced multiplexed PEC immunosensor array (Fig. 8II), and superior performances were gained in real application. The ZnO NRs-modified paper substrate is very significant for many practical applications for flexible/foldable and disposable electronic devices. Furthermore, the convergence of LED technology and biotechnology opens up a new avenue for the development of simple, inexpensive, portable, and easy-to-use point-of-care testing platforms for public health and environmental monitoring in developing countries, resource-limited, and remote regions with limited facilities.

Cellulosic paper has been demonstrated to have high protein capacity, which could increase detection signal and improve assay sensitivity. However, it is a rather nonreactive material for direct chemical coupling. In order to develop a potent method for controlled conjugation cellulose and proteins, Bodelón et al. fabricated a hybrid scaffold based on the adsorption and in situ self-assembly of surface-oxidized nickel nanoparticles on the paper cellulose, which acted as “docking sites” for the selective immobilization of proteins containing polyhistidine tags (His-tag) (Fig. 9). The interaction between the nickel substrate and the His-tagged protein G was noticeably resilient toward chemicals at concentrations that quickly disrupt standard Ni-NTA and Ni-IDA complexes. Excitingly, such a devised system is a robust attachment. The versatility and biocompatibility of the oxide nickel substrate were further demonstrated by enzymatic reactions.64

The composites containing metal oxides and other nanomaterials normally present more superior performance compared with those containing a single metal oxide.151,152 For example, Sun et al. reported that ZnO nanoflakes (ZNF) were electrodeposited onto a gold-modified paper electrode, and then functionalized with CuS by a hydrothermal and ion exchange method. The recombination process of electron–hole pairs in CuS was hindered due to the match of the energy levels between ZnO and CuS. In addition, due to ZNF possessing a high surface area, it provided much more multidimensional spaces for loading CuS, which enhanced the visible light absorption. In virtue of the fast electron transfer from CuS to ZNF and then to the Au paper electrode, the sensor exhibited high PEC performance.104 Lan et al. fabricated a photoelectrochemical immunosensor with a microfluidic paper-based analytical device using different sizes of CdTe-quantum-dots-sensitized flower-like 3D ZnO superstructures as photoactive materials (Fig. 10), which could not only adequately utilize light luminous energy but could also effectively promote charge separation and consequently enhance the photocurrent conversion efficiency due to the cascade band-edge levels by coupling different band gap semiconductor quantum dots as sensitizers.47

5. Modification of carbon nanomaterials on paper cellulose
In recent years, various carbon nanomaterials (CNMs), including 0D, 1D, and 2D materials, such as fullerenes, CNTs, GO, and rGO, have attracted dramatic attention. Featuring unique properties, such as a large specific surface area, high intrinsic carrier mobility, electrical conductivity, and environment stability as well as a potential for low-cost production, the CNMs have already demonstrated promise in applications in nanoelectronics, energy storage devices, capacitors, microelectrodes, and sensors devices.153 These CNMs supported on cellulose are incorporated with μ PADs, building up a series of biosensors that can quantitatively and selectively detect biomolecules.153
The performance of paper-based electronic devices depends on the conductive properties of the structures fabricated on the paper, which completely rely on the density and the connectivity of the conducting material.5,20 Hence, with excellent conductivity, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were deposited directly onto cellulose by dip coating to prepare conductive MWNT–cellulose. The as-prepared MWNT–cellulose brings more benefits as follows. (I) The fabrication process is simple and scalable; (II) it is more potent in creating conductive CNT-to-CNT junction networks, resulting in noticeably low CNT loadings compared to the previously reported percolation threshold values for composites; (III) the features of cellulose-based materials could be maintained; (IV) the CNTs coated on the surface of cellulose can contact directly and quickly with chemicals, which enhances the sensitivity distinctly. Yun et al. developed a carbon nanotube–cellulose composite paper. MWNTs were imported onto paper as a conducting material through covalent bonding between the cellulose and MWNTs. A transistor was prepared on this paper without the existence of any semiconducting or insulating layer. Surprisingly, the on/off ratio was proved to mainly rely on the content of MWNTs in the paper.154 Our group also reported that CNTs were modified on cellulose on the PWE of the paper device through sequential assembling. Positively charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)–functionalized CNTs (PDDA–CNTs) and negatively charged CdS NPs were assembled on the interwoven cellulose.108 The photocurrent generated by CdS/PWE was lower than that of CdS/PDDA–CNTs/PWE because of the lack of CNT connectors. Therefore, CNTs that bridge the CdS NPs to the screen-printed carbon working electrode may promote the photocurrent generation by trapping the conduction-band electrons. The conductive CNTs-modified interwoven cellulose provides efficient and fast electron-transfer paths for the conduction-band electrons to the PWE.
Graphene is an exciting material because of its one atom-thick 2D structure, which makes it easily deformed in the direction normal perpendicular to its surface, thus providing good mechanical flexibility.153 It has a large theoretical specific surface area, high intrinsic mobility, high Young's modulus and thermal conductivity, and its optical transmittance and good electrical conductivity merit attention for applications such as transparent conductive electrodes, among many other potential applications.155 The inherent mechanical and electronic properties of graphene make it a useful material for applications in bioanalysis and in other devices related to sensors, such as μPADs.
GO and gold nanowires (GNWs) composites were prepared through noncovalent absorption. The resulting GNWs/GO hybrids, combining the advantages of graphene and GNWs, were used as a new electrode material to construct an ultrasensitive immunosensor through the use of cellulose as a scaffold. Li et al. reported a working electrode of 3D-μPAD fabricated through chitosan coating and GNWs/GO modification, as shown in Fig. 11I.82 CuS/GO composites were prepared using GO as the starting material, where the oxygen containing groups in GO controlled the decoration of CuS nanoparticles without aggregation. Composites of ultrathin gold nanowire and graphene with high water solubility, extraordinary biological, and electrical properties were prepared in an in situ solution phase to establish an electrochemical sensor. The CuS/GO nanocomposites-based sensor showed high sensitivity, stability, and a fast amperometric response toward the electro-oxidation of H2O2. Such an established sensor was successfully applied to the detection of AFP in real serum samples from both healthy people and cancer patients, and the results were well consistent with a commercial electrochemiluminescence method, which demonstrated the potential application of nanocomposites in developing highly sensitive, environmental friendly, and cost-effective electrochemical biosensors. Sun et al. fabricated an rGO-modified cellulose paper working electrode via an in situ hydrothermal reduction of GO. Next, branched zinc oxide rods (BZR) were grown on the rGO-modified cellulose via a hydrothermal process (Fig. 11II), which could afford ample sites for antibodies labeling. The resulting BZR/rGO-PWE-based electrochemical immunosensor demonstrated superior analytical performance for the detection of AFP, with satisfactory results attained.76

In order to improve the performance of the sensors based on paper analytical devices, Au NPs and flower-like reduced graphene oxide (FrGO) have been used to modify the cellulose (Fig. 12) by Yu's group. A Au NPs layer was grown on the surfaces of cellulose positioned at the hydrophilic zone of the paper to build a Au-PWE. Prior to modifying the FrGO on the cellulose of the analytical device, a flower-like ZnO (FZnO) template was first fabricated. Then, the Au-PWE was soaked into the above mixed solution. The resulting FZnO/Au-PWE was thus prepared, followed by repeated washing with ethanol and water. Finally, the FZnO/Au-PWE was immersed in GO solution and then electrochemically reduced at a constant potential. After the electroreduction process, the rGO-FZnO/Au-PWE was treated with hydrochloric acid to remove the ZnO template. The resulting FrGO/Au modified cellulose was successfully prepared and utilized as a working electrode. Such a proposed biosensor showed high sensitivity, good stability, and acceptable reproducibility in Pb2+ detection, attributed to the electron-transfer acceleration of Au/FrGO/Au-PWE. This method could be expanded readily for detecting other metal ions and could help in monitoring public and environmental safety.80 Besides the template sacrifice approach, graphene-modified cellulose of paper was fabricated through a layer-by-layer self-assembly as well. The porous Au-PWE was prepared according to our previous works. The as-prepared Au-PWE was then modified by positively charged PDDA-GR. Taking advantage of the amplification effects of the GR-modified Au-PWE, the prepared DNA sensor not only performed with excellent specificity, but also had a limit of detection as low as 8.5 × 10−18 M.156 In addition, we prepared a Ag nanoparticle and PDDA-rGO modified paper anodic electrode/paper cathodic electrode by self-assembly.157,158

6. Modification of a molecular imprinted polymer on paper cellulose
Despite the current analytical methods based on μ-PADs showing remarkable sensitivity and selectivity, most of them depend almost completely on sophisticated biological receptors, such as antibodies,159–161 DNA,162–164 or an aptamer,165–167 as biochemical recognition elements. These biomolecules may be subjected to limitations because of their biological denaturation. Molecular imprinting polymer (MIP), as a well-known and widely used tool to produce synthetic biomimetic receptors for target molecules, provides an ideal substitute.168–170 Hence, a rapid growth of interest has been observed in the fabrication and development of MIP. MIP was produced by cross-linking monomers in the presence of a template molecule (target molecules). The resulting cavities reproduced the size and shape even when the template was removed, and the resulting material could specifically recognize and bind the target. Featuring many merits, including specific recognition, superior physical and chemical stability compared with antibodies, DNA or aptamer etc., ease of mass preparation, and easy availability, MIP have been applied in many areas, including catalysis, sensors, and separation.170
Our group introduced the molecular imprinting technique into μ-PADs.85 MIP was coated onto the surface of AuNPs-modified cellulose through an electropolymerization of the functional monomer. The MIP layer was prepared toward acetate buffer solution containing the template (D-glutamic acid) and monomer (o-PD) in Au-PWE at room temperature (Fig. 13). Due to the porous morphology of the paper as well as the high specific surface area and conductivity of the resulting Au NPs layer on the cellulose, the effective surface area and the sensitivity of the Au-PWE was enhanced remarkably. The molecular recognition occurred between D-glutamic acid and the binding cavities in the MIP layer, which hindered the electron transfer of the [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− redox reaction to the Au-PWE. The peak current decreased with the increase in D-glutamic concentration. Based on the MIP technique and the principle of origami, a microfluidic MIP-based electro-analytical origami device (μMEOD) was established for the detection of D-glutamic acid. This μMEOD exhibited a novel platform for high selectivity, high sensitivity, high throughput, and high specificity, and for multiplex assay as well as point-of-care diagnosis in public health as well as environmental monitoring. Our group also reported a layer of polypyrrole grafted onto the ZnO/Au-PWE surface by a simple electropolymerization method.88 After the template molecule was removed from the matrix of the MIPs, the recognition sites of the MIPs were fabricated, which could specifically recognize and bind pentachlorophenol. The proposed PEC sensor exhibited a short absorption time, high selectivity, good precision, and acceptable stability and reproducibility, and could be used for the detection of pentachlorophenol in real samples.

Meanwhile, our group established a molecularly imprinted polymer-grafted paper-based multi-disk micro-disk plate (PMIP-MMP) for the detection of pesticide (Fig. 14).86 MIP-grafted paper disks were fabricated by a facile in situ polymerization of the MIP layer on the surface of the cellulose. Before the in situ polymerization of MIP, CC groups were introduced onto the surface of cellulose using a silane-coupling technique. After silanization of the surfaces of cellulose, an in situ polymerization of the MIPs layer on the surface of cellulose was performed. Then, binding sites on the MIP surface were created through eluting the template molecule. Each MIP-grafted paper disk on the P-MIP-MMP was independently assayed, with the structure of the plate promoting the simultaneous assay of multiplex samples. An indirect competitive assay format, based on the competition between free analyte and immobilized analyte in the grafted MIP layer, was used to quantify the analyte in the sample.97 Herein, the proposed paper-based MIP-grafted multi-disk micro-disk plate was used to detect 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid as a proof-of-concept analyte.86 This approach afforded a potent protocol for the simple, low-cost, rapid, and high-throughput detection of pesticides in real samples with satisfactory results in the area of food inspection and environmental monitoring and so on.

Conjugated polymers, such as polythiophenes, polypyrroles, polyanilines, poly(p-phenylenevinylene), and their derivatives have been normally employed in photovoltaic devices as antenna layers for the photovoltaic conversion of solar energy because of their high absorption coefficients in the visible light region, high mobility of charge carriers, and excellent stability. These polymers have also been used to modify the cellulose, which increased the properties of the paper devices. Zhang et al. reported a flexible fully-integrated self-powered system based on paper,171 in which the electrode material as well as the conducting interconnections of p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA)-doped polypyrrole embedded in-between the cellulose fibers (p-TSA-PPy/cellulose) were obtained by combining an in situ chemical oxidative polymerization with a paper microfluidic technique. In such a unique integrated configuration, the utilization of the p-TSA-PPy/cellulose network not only dramatically enhances the horizontal electrical conductivity, but also overcomes the issue of vertical electroconductivity, allowing for top-channel-bottom conductive interconnections. As a proof-of-concept, an all-paper microfluidic analytical platform that integrated a paper-based electrochemiluminescence strategy and proposed power paper was constructed, with comparable performance achieved. This work greatly improves the understandings of all-paper-based self-powered systems, and presents the significant potential applications of paper-based flexible electronics. Li et al. reported a sensitive microfluidic origami electrochemical immunodevice based on a polyaniline-Au NPs-modified paper working electrode (PANI/Au-PWE) as a sensor platform and different redox substrates as tracers.110 PANI fibers with a diameter of about 150 nm were tangled and twisted with each other, forming uniform and porous networks on Au-PWE, which further increased the effective surface area and enhanced the electron transfer for a sensitive electrochemical response. Due to the electropolymerization of aniline in an Au-PWE, the effective surface area of the PANI/Au-PWE could remarkably enhance the sensitivity. A molecular imprinting polymer with conductivity was introduced into microfluidic paper-based analytical devices through electropolymerization of molecular imprinted polyaniline (MPANI) in a novel Au nanoparticles (Au NPs)-modified paper working electrode (Au-PWE).87 Under visible light irradiation, the MPANI could generate the photoelectric transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, delivering the excited electrons to the AuNPs, and then to the carbon working electrode. Simultaneously, it is believed that a positively charged hole of MPANI that took part in the oxidation process was consumed by ascorbic acid to promote the amplification of the photocurrent response. Polyterthiophene (pTTh), a photoresponsive conducting polymer, showed superior outstanding optical properties and prominent environmental stability. Wu et al. reported that a paper-based analytical device was built for the sensitive detection of the carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) through combining visible-light-enhanced biofuel cells and an electrochemical immunosensor. pTTh served as a catalyst in the cathode for the reduction of oxygen upon illumination by visible light. The exceptional properties of pTTh make it a potential alternative catalyst to trigger a cathodic reaction.
7. Conclusions and perspectives
In conclusion, paper devices are becoming popular because of their low cost and porous nature. Paper has tremendous potential for disposable point-of-care devices. So far, many fabrication techniques have been established to construct conducting structures for biosensing devices. These techniques can be carried out in an ordinary lab. To construct conducting structures, cellulose has served as a versatile scaffold for self-assembly toward advanced devices. Cellulose could be functionalized with metal, bimetallic, metal oxide, carbon, and molecular imprinting polymers, which expand the application of paper devices. A new series of composites with cellulose as the scaffold can arouse the development of fascinating technologies and interesting applications. Nevertheless, many challenges still exist in the fabrication and application of cellulose composites materials.
At present, the cellulose composites materials of paper-based sensing devices reported mainly work very well in the laboratory scale, yet when it comes to the reproducibility and repeatability, the performance of these devices do not match with those of commercial devices. Fine tuning of the formation and composition of these composites is vital to enhance their performance. The influence of different composite nanomaterials on the sensing devices also needs to be investigated, which is essential to bring the paper-based sensing devices closer to market. This might require a concentrated effort on the part of researchers in the cellulose modification of the paper industry, materials, bioscience, and electrical engineering to transform the prototypes into commercial products.
The pulp and paper industry uses a lot of fibers from different sources to manufacture paper with different qualities. However, most of the paper-based sensing devices are fabricated with Whatman filter paper or commercial printing papers. The effect of the paper quality on device performance has not been determined. It is essential to investigate the effect of the paper type on sensor performance, since the performances of paper are dramatically influenced by the type of fibers. Also, most of the reports published to date are dedicated to developing scalable fabrication techniques and demonstrating novel applications of the paper-based devices. However, comprehensive mathematical modeling of the paper-based devices has not been undertaken yet, but the modeling of the electrical, ionic, and fluidic characteristics of paper could provide solutions to many of the problems associated with paper-based devices.
By combining structured paper cellulose with nanomaterials, versatile low-cost and easy-to-use paper fluidic testing systems can be generated for a wide range of analytical tasks. The paper devices are perfectly fitted to operation outdoor and independent of high-tech laboratories. While much attention has been placed on the potential for improved clinical diagnostics, there is a potential for expanded applications in many other areas and fields. In particular, the potential application of μ-PADs for large epidemiology studies is exciting, because traditional detection suffers from high cost and low speed as limiting factors. In a similar fashion, the low cost and ease of use of paper devices may open the door to widespread analytical measurements that could help realize the self-monitoring of anyone, anytime, and anywhere. However, while the function of paper devices is simple, great efforts should be devoted to the integration of multi-function, miniaturization, and intelligentization with higher sensitivity and selectivity. It is anticipated that μPADs could help reduce the cost and realize remote point-of-care testing.
