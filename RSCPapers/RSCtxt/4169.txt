    , Accepted 4th June 2018First published on 5th June 2018AbstractThe preparation of one-dimensional carbon materials with complex dual-scale nanostructures for supercapacitor applications still remains a challenge. Herein we report a simple strategy for electrosynthesis of silicon carbide nanowire (SiC NW)-derived carbon with dual-scale nanostructures for high performance supercapacitors. This method is highlighted by using solid oxide membrane technology to directly convert powdered silicon dioxide/carbon precursors into SiC NWs, and then the synthesized SiC NWs are further transformed into mesoporous silicon carbide-derived carbon nanowires (SiC-CDC NWs) via a subsequent in situ molten salt electrochemical etching process. Benefitting from their dual-scale nanostructures, these SiC-CDC NWs exhibit highly reversible specific capacitance of 260 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and good cyclability (97.9% after 5000 cycles) in 6 M KOH aqueous solution without the need for doping the SiC-CDC NWs. It is suggested that this process is a promising general approach for synthesizing CDC materials with dual-scale nanostructures for energy storage applications.
1. Introduction
Electrochemical energy storage technologies are critical to enable modern civilization to secure a sustainable energy supply for the society.1–7 Amongst many promising candidates, supercapacitors have attracted tremendous attention because of their high power density, long cycle life, simple operating principle, and fast charge capability.1–3,5,6 In the past few decades, much effort has been devoted to searching for advanced electrode materials for supercapacitors.7 Carbon materials have been extensively investigated as one of the most promising candidates for supercapacitor applications due to their attractive features, including light weight, large surface area, fast charging–discharging kinetics, good electrical conductivity, and high chemical stability.1,7–17 For carbon-based materials, only electrical double-layer capacitance (EDLC) is available, and EDLC is based on the fully reversible and fast electrosorption of electrolyte ions on the surface of the charged carbonaceous electrode materials.11 Thus, surface area and pore size distribution are the key concerns.1,8,9,11–13 Commonly, micropores (pore diameter < 2 nm) provide a high surface area but always not fully accessible to ions and mesopores (2 nm < pore diameter < 50 nm) allow good electrolyte penetration.9,11,12 Therefore, an appropriate mesopores/micropores ratio is believed to be beneficial for the high performance of supercapacitors.7,11 In recent years, porous carbide-derived carbon (CDC) materials, such as silicon carbide-derived carbon (SiC-CDC), were found to be promising as electrode materials for supercapacitors due to their high surface areas and porous structures.14–16 However, CDC materials generally possess narrow micropores, which are not easy for electrolyte to access the complete surface of the CDC materials.11 It is generally believed that high surface area carbon materials with regularly interconnected mesopores are highly desirable for supercapacitors.7 Therefore, in recent years, design and synthesis of one-dimensional porous carbon nanostructures with mesopores has been recognized as the promising strategy to improve the performance of supercapacitors.7 However, it is still a challenge to prepare one-dimensional CDC materials with mesopores through a conventional method.
Porous CDC materials are generally produced from metal carbides (MCs).14,18 It has been proved that the performance of CDC-based supercapacitors can be enhanced by lowering the particle size of CDCs down to nanoscale.11,14 Therefore, nanoscale CDCs produced from nanosized MCs have been investigated in recent years.11,14,19 Although tremendous research efforts have been devoted to synthesizing MCs nanostructures via various methods,20–25 such as template synthesis, magnesiothermic reduction, polymer pyrolysis, molten salt synthesis, etc., these methods require subsequent additional processes to further convert the synthesized MCs into CDC materials. In addition, the most common method used to produce CDCs is utilizing chlorine gas (Cl2) to selectively etch off metal/semi-metal (M) atoms from MCs.6,16,18,19 Recently, it is reported that a low temperature electrochemical etching process can also be used for the selective extraction of the “M” and/or “A” elements from MCs and MAX phases (such as Ti3AlC2, Ti2SC, etc.) to produce porous CDCs, “AX” or “MX” (“MXene”) materials.26,27 It should be noted here that the MAX phases are a group of layered ternary compounds with the formula of Mn+1AXn (n = 1–3), where “M” presents an early transition metal, “A” presents an A-group element, and “X” is carbon or nitrogen.26,27 However, the chlorine process and the low temperature electrochemical etching process entail complicated multistep processes, and the CDCs produced by the two processes mainly possess micropores. To produce mesopores in the CDC materials, additional processes such as activation are usually needed.14 Therefore, establishing a new method for the facile production of CDC materials with mesoporous structures is still extremely needed.
The recently developed novel molten salt electroreduction method,28–31 in combination with emerging solid oxide membrane (SOM) technology,32–37 offer an attractive strategy for the facile electrosynthesis of micro/nanostructured MCs from abundant and inexpensive metal oxides/carbon (MOs/C) precursors in molten salts. In particular, in our recent work,35,38 it has been proved that the molten salt electroreduction process can be used for the synthesis of nanosized MCs such as one-dimensional SiC nanowires (NWs). More importantly, the SOM-assisted controllable electroreduction process further combined with a subsequent in situ molten salt electrochemical etching process has the potential to provide a new simple electrochemical route (MOs/C → MCs → CDCs) for the synthesis of porous CDC materials. The high temperature molten salt electrochemical etching process is expected to be beneficial for creating mesopores during the etching process,10,19 and it is reasonable to believe that the unique mesoporous structure formed in the molten salt can be easily wetted by electrolyte and thus rapid ionic motion can be achieved.10 However, up to now, there has been no work carried out on the one-step electrosynthesis of mesoporous CDC materials from MOs/C through molten salt electroreduction and electrochemical etching processes for supercapacitors.
Here, we report a simple electrochemical route from silicon dioxide/carbon (SiO2/C) precursors to mesoporous one-dimensional SiC-CDC NWs in molten calcium chloride (CaCl2). An interesting structural evolution from nascent SiO2/C solid particles to SiC NWs and then to SiC-CDC NWs with dual-scale nanostructures can be observed during the synthesis process. As expected, the as-synthesized mesoporous SiC-CDC NWs have great potential for supercapacitor applications because of their unique dual-scale nanostructures with high electrochemical active surface areas and mesopores. Considering the low cost and abundance of SiO2/C precursors, this route has a significant potential to provide a new simple method for the electrosynthesis of mesoporous SiC-CDC NWs for high performance supercapacitors.
2. Experimental
2.1 Fabrication of SiO2/C cathodes
Silicon dioxide (SiO2) powder (approximately 50–100 nm) and carbon (C) powder (approximately 500 nm) with approximately 1–2 wt% polyvinyl butyral binder were mixed in the molar ratio of SiO2:C = 1:1 corresponding to SiC and homogenized by ball milling. Then, about 2.0 g of the milled mixtures were pressed under 10–15 MPa to form a porous SiO2/C pellet. The pressed pellet with an appropriate open porosity of ∼28.1% was attached to an electrode wire and this served as a cathode precursor for the electrosynthesis of SiC NWs.
2.2 Fabrication of the solid oxide membrane (SOM)-based anode
The SOM-based anode system34,35 consists of a one-end-closed 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) tube filled with carbon-saturated liquid metal (tin or copper), and a Mo/Fe–Cr–Al wire was inserted into the assembled YSZ tube to conduct electricity. The carbon saturated in the liquid metal was used as a reductant to react with the oxygen migrated from the cathode during the electroreduction process, and the liquid metal was used as a medium to transport oxygen ions.34 The YSZ membrane selectively conducted only oxygen ions but blocked other ions, and separated the liquid metal anodic reaction area from molten electrolyte. As a result, the secondary reactions caused by the anodic products could be accordingly avoided, and the cathodic reactions thus could be strictly controlled.
2.3 Molten salt electroreduction experiments
The fabricated cathode SiO2/C pellet and the SOM-based anode were assembled in an alumina crucible to form an electrolytic cell. CaCl2 (or CaCl2–CaO) was employed as electrolyte. Ultra high purity argon gas was continuously purged through the inside of the electrolytic cell to maintain an inert atmosphere during the entire experimental process. When the system temperature reached the experimental temperature (1000 °C), the pre-electrolysis process was first performed at 2.5 V for 3–5 h to remove the residual moisture and other redox-active impurities, and then the electroreduction process was carried out systematically by using the assembled SOM-based anode and the SiO2/C cathode in molten CaCl2 (or CaCl2–CaO) electrolyte. A Biologic HCP-803 electrochemical workstation was used to record current–time curves during the electroreduction experiment. Oxygen component was gradually electroreduced and migrated through the molten salt and membrane to the SOM-based anode system, where it was oxidized by carbon to form CO/CO2 gases. Simultaneously, SiC was electrosynthesized at the cathode after the oxygen contained in the SiO2/C precursors was completely electroreduced. The inert SOM with selective permeability for only oxygen ions was used to strictly control the electroreduction process, therefore, the predesigned SiC without any impurity (such as residual carbon) can be synthesized. During the electroreduction process for SiO2/C, it has been proved that CaSiO3 was commonly formed as an intermediate product at the reaction area through the reaction, i.e., SiO2 + O2− + Ca2+ → CaSiO3, and CaSiO3 would be dissolved into molten CaCl2 to form SiO32−, then SiO32− would be electrodeposited to form Si NWs.38 Therefore, the in situ dissolution–electrodeposition mechanism involving SiO32− ion could contribute to the formation of SiC NWs.35,38 In our previous work,35,38 SiC NWs have been successfully synthesized directly from SiO2/C precursors without using any template and catalyst. The dissolution–electrodeposition reaction mechanism (SiO2 → SiO32− → Si) in molten CaCl2 has also been well defined.38,39 More information about the experimental details and the reaction mechanism can be found in the ESI† and our previous work.34–38
2.4 Molten salt electrochemical etching experiments
After SiC NWs have been completely electrosynthesized from SiO2/C precursors, the obtained SiC NWs then served as carbide precursors to produce SiC-CDC NWs by an in situ molten salt electrochemical etching process. The temperature can be chosen to be 800–1000 °C and the inert atmosphere as well as electrolyte of the electrolytic system was kept unchanged during the subsequent in situ electrochemical etching process. For the in situ electrochemical etching experiments, the electrodes were changed, i.e., the electrosynthesized SiC NWs were used as the anode, a graphite rod (or other metallic electrode such as Ni) inserted into electrolyte served as the cathode, and a potential of 2.5–3.0 V was applied between the SiC NW electrode and the graphite electrode (or other metallic electrode such as Ni). While the etching potential was applied, Si can be electrochemically extracted from SiC and then removed through the molten salt, and thus porous carbon can be produced.26,27 After the etching experiment, the furnace was cooled down to room temperature, and then the synthesized SiC-CDC NWs were washed with distilled/deionized water and dried. The reaction mechanism and more experimental details about the molten salt electrochemical etching process can be found in the ESI.†
2.5 Materials characterization
The morphology of the electrosynthesized products was characterized by using a JEOL JSM-6700F field-emission-type scanning electron microscope (FESEM), and using a JEOL JEM-2010F high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) operating at 200 kV. The elemental composition of the samples was analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) attached to the SEM and TEM. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku D/Max-2550 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) operated at a voltage of 40 kV and 100 mA. Thermogravimetry (TG) analysis was carried out on a NETZSCH STA 449 F3 instrument. TG curves were recorded in a constant air or flowing Ar gas (30 mL min−1) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 up to 1000 °C. The oxygen contents of the samples were analyzed by a Leco EF-400 nitrogen/oxygen determinator. Digital optical photographs of the samples were taken with a KEYENCE VHX-1000C digital optical microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer with Al Kα radiation. Raman spectroscopy of the samples was performed on a Renishaw InVia Raman microspectrometer using an Ar ion laser (514.5 nm). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Avatar 380 spectrometer. N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 sorptometer at liquid nitrogen temperature (−196 °C). Before the measurement, each sample was degassed at 200 °C for 6 h. The specific surface areas were evaluated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Pore size distribution curves were calculated using the desorption branch of the isotherms and by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.
The electrochemical properties of the synthesized SiC-CDC NWs were investigated in a symmetrical two-electrode cell. The synthesized SiC-CDC NWs were used as both the positive and negative electrode materials with a cellulose separator using a LIR2032 coin cell at room temperature.5 The testing electrode was prepared using a slurry composed of 94 wt% SiC-CDC NWs and a 6 wt% PTFE binder (60% suspension in water). Notably, no additional conducting agent was used in the electrode because the one-dimensional SiC-CDC NWs with high surface area have high conductivity to act as both a conductor and an active material.40 The slurry was painted between two pieces of nickel foil (10 mm diameter) and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. To compare with the previous study carried out in the molten salt,10 electrolyte containing 6 M KOH was used to study the capacitive behavior of the prepared electrodes. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) study was performed at a potential range of 0–1.0 V with different scan rates by using a Biologic HCP-803 electrochemical workstation. Galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were conducted with a cutoff voltage of 0–1.0 V (NEWARE, China). The specific capacitance was calculated using Cs = 4It/Vm, where I is the discharge current (A), t is the discharge time (s), V is the voltage change (V) excluding the voltage drop during the discharge process, and m is the total mass of the active material (g).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Strategy design and electrosynthesis of SiC NWs
The designed strategy for the electrosynthesis of SiC-CDC NWs is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 (more details can be found in the ESI†). The first step of the synthesis process is the production of SiC NWs. Powdered SiO2/C mixtures are employed as starting reagents (Fig. S1, S2a and b†). Interestingly, homogenous SiC NWs can be directly electrosynthesized from powdered SiO2/C precursors in molten CaCl2 at 1000 °C (Fig. 2, S2c and S3†). The obtained bulk SiC NWs exhibit yellow color (Fig. 2a) with porous cotton-like morphology (Fig. 2b (inset) and Fig. S2c†). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images clearly reveal that the synthesized SiC NW structures are uniform (Fig. 2b and c). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images show that the as-obtained SiC NWs are free of hollow structures (Fig. 2d and e). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum confirms that the NWs only consist of Si and C (Fig. 2d (inset)). The enlarged HRTEM image and its corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern reveal that the diffraction spots can be indexed based on the 3C-SiC crystal structure (Fig. 2e). The d spacing value labeled by the parallel lines is measured to be 0.25 nm (Fig. 2e (inset)), which is in good agreement with the interplanar spacing of {111} planes of 3C-SiC, implying that the SiC NWs grow along the [111] direction.22

This electrosynthesis process includes the production of SiC NWs through electroreduction (i) and the subsequent electrochemical etching process (ii) for the formation of mesoporous SiC-CDC NWs.

(d) Typical TEM image and (e) HRTEM image of the as-synthesized SiC NWs; the inset in (d) is the EDS spectrum of the SiC NWs and the insets in (e) are its corresponding SAED pattern and Fourier transformed image showing lattice spacing. 
The typical current–time curve of the electrosynthesis of SiC NWs is shown in Fig. 3a, it is obvious that the synthesis process can be finished within 5 h, and the current efficiency of the synthesis process is calculated to be approximately 70%. To further investigate the synthesized SiC NWs, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were carried out (Fig. 3b–f and S3†). The FTIR spectrum shows Si–C stretching at approximately 830 cm−1 (Fig. 3b). The Raman spectrum of the SiC NWs indicates that the synthesized SiC NWs are similar to those of the previous study.41,42 XRD patterns of the final product exhibit clear diffraction peaks (Fig. 3d and S3†), which can be indexed as the 3C-SiC phase (JCPDS # 29-1129). XPS spectra of Si 2p and C 1s regions of the as-synthesized SiC NWs feature peak maxima at 100.6 eV and 282.5 eV, respectively (Fig. 3e and f), which is characteristic of SiC.21 Obviously, the SiC NWs synthesized using the inert SOM-based anode system are pure SiC NWs without any residual carbon, which can be further revealed by thermogravimetry (TG) analysis (Fig. S4†). In addition, according to the TG curves (Fig. S4†), it is further confirmed that SiO2 cannot be chemically reduced by the mixed carbon powder at the experimental temperature. Therefore, the weight loss of the SiO2/C precursors during the synthesis process is mainly attributed to the electroreduction reaction. The weight change of the SiO2/C precursors during the electroreduction process is shown in Fig. S5,† and the lattice parameter variation of the formed SiC phase during the electroreduction process is shown in Fig. S6.† After approximately 6 h electroreduction, the weight of the obtained SiC product is close to the theoretical value (55.56 wt%), and the oxygen content of the SiC product lowers to 1200 ppm. The oxygen content can be further decreased to a lower level with the increase of electroreduction time. With the electroreduction time increasing approximately to 6 h, the lattice parameter approaches 4.359 Å (JCPDS: 29-1129), indicating that pure SiC NWs can be synthesized within 6 h. These observations confirmed that high yield production of pure SiC NWs can be achieved by the SOM-assisted controllable molten salt electroreduction process within 6 h. Based on Fig. S7,† it is obvious that CaSiO3 can be easily formed in molten CaCl2, and the formed CaSiO3 will dissolve in CaCl2 to form SiO32− due to its considerable solubility (1.56 wt% at 850 °C) in molten CaCl2.43–45 Fig. S8† further confirms that the reaction mechanism typically involves the reduction of SiO2 and CaSiO3. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve and the slow potentiodynamic scan curve suggest that the electroreduction of SiO2 and CaSiO3 occurs at ∼0.85 V and ∼1.26 V, respectively (Fig. S8†). Generally, it is believed that the in situ dissolution–electrodeposition mechanism involved with SiO32− ions, i.e., SiO2 → CaSiO3 → SiO32− → Si, the solid-to-solid electroreduction mechanism, i.e., SiO2 + 4e− → Si + 2O2−, and the in situ carbonization process, i.e., Si + C → SiC contribute to the formation of SiC NWs,35,38,43–47 as schematically shown in Fig. S9.† The detailed reaction mechanism can be found in reactions (S1)–(S9) in the ESI.† The SEM observation further suggests that the reaction mechanism mainly includes the solid-to-solid electroreduction reaction process and the dissolution–electrodeposition reaction process, as shown in Fig. S10.† Actually, SiO2 powder has also been successfully electroreduced to Si NWs in molten CaCl2 (ref. 43, 44, 46 and 47) and the dissolution–electrodeposition mechanism has been well demonstrated.43 Based on the similarity of the morphologies of the electrosynthesized Si NWs and SiC NWs, it is reasonable to deduce that the particle growth mechanisms of Si NWs and SiC NWs in molten salts are quite similar.38 The crystal growth process for SiC NWs is also governed by both the Ostwald-ripening mechanism and the oriented-attachment mechanism.43,44,48–50

3.2 Conversion of SiC NWs into SiC-CDC NWs
After SiC NWs have been electrosynthesized in molten salts, a molten salt-based in situ electrochemical etching process was then carried out to further convert the as-synthesized nanostructured SiC NWs into porous SiC-CDC NWs, as schematically shown in Fig. S11.† CV analysis reveals that the electrochemical etching process is possible (Fig. S12†). It can be seen from the CV curve that an obvious and reproducible peak around 1.5 V is observed, which indicates that the electrochemical etching reaction occurs at approximately 1.5 V (Fig. S12†). However, 2.5–3.0 V (lower than the decomposition potential of molten CaCl2) was selected as the applied potential during the electrochemical etching process, which has been proved to be able to provide sufficient electrochemical reaction driving force and reaction speed for the etching process. XRD, Raman, and XPS analyses further confirm that the as-synthesized SiC NWs can be electrochemically transformed into SiC-CDC NWs (Fig. 4a–c, S13 and S14†). The Raman spectra display different features of D and G bands, which generally reveal that the synthesized SiC-CDC NWs can be controlled to form porous ordered carbon and/or amorphous carbon. The XPS analysis shows that the produced SiC-CDC NWs are composed of carbon and a small amount of oxygen (C–O). Not surprisingly, the etching potential and temperature play important roles in the etching process. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the synthesized SiC NWs and the SiC-CDC NWs (Fig. 4d, S15 and S16†) further demonstrate that the SiC NWs have been converted into mesoporous SiC-CDC NWs. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface areas (BET SSA) of the synthesized SiC NWs and SiC-CDC NWs are calculated to be 98.46 m2 g−1 and 1182 m2 g−1, respectively. The diameters of the pores formed in the SiC-CDC NWs are approximately 2–4 nm (Fig. S16†), these mesopores generated in molten salts are believed to be accessible to the electrolyte ions. Commonly, SiC-CDC produced through the chlorination method possesses micropores.14 However, in this work, as expected, mesopores have been directly created in the SiC-CDC NWs. This observation suggests that the high temperature molten salt electrochemical etching process can be used to produce CDC materials with mesopores. Fig. 4e–i reveals that the original homogeneous SiC NW structures can be generally maintained during the electrochemical etching process, and the as-synthesized SiC-CDC NWs typically possess dual-scale nanostructures, i.e., NW structure and the secondary amorphous/ordered mesoporous nanostructure (Fig. 4e–i and S17†). In addition, further analysis (Fig. S18a and b†) suggests that the reaction mechanism of the etching process can be generally expressed as the reactions, i.e., SiC − 4e− → Si4+ + C (SiC-CDC) and Si4+ + 4e− → Si, and the proposed route has the potential to realize cyclic production of CDC materials (Fig. S18c†).

(e) SEM image, (f) TEM image, and (g–i) HRTEM images of the as-synthesized SiC-CDC NWs. The SiC-CDC NWs are approximately 20 nm in diameter, the secondary amorphous and/or ordered mesoporous nanostructures can be controlled to form during the electrochemical etching process. 
The molten salt process has been recently proved to be a facile route for the synthesis of hierarchical nanostructures with remarkable electrochemical performance for supercapacitor applications.4 Considering the electroreduction process has the potential to be used to produce a wide variety of micro/nanostructured MCs and MAX phases from MOs/C precursors in molten salts at 700–1000 °C,35,51,52 it is reasonable to anticipate that the newly proposed simple route has significant potential to be used for the synthesis of various CDC materials, such as TiC-CDC, as confirmed by Raman analysis in Fig. S19.† The Raman spectra comparison generally reveals that the synthesized TiC-CDC and SiC-CDC exhibit different properties. The synthesized TiC-CDC mainly contains amorphous carbon. It is thus suggested that amorphous and/or ordered CDCs can be produced from different MCs through the molten salt electrochemical etching process. More importantly, a previous study53–55 has demonstrated that CO2 can be converted into carbon in molten salts via electrolysis. Therefore, it is believable that the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to porous CDC materials via the proposed route (MOs/CO2 → MCs → CDCs) in molten salts is also possible, as demonstrated in Fig. S20 and S21.† Unlike previously reported molten salt CO2 capture and the electrochemical transformation process,53–55 the process proposed herein first converts CO2 into micro/nanostructured MCs, and then the as-synthesized MCs are further converted into mesoporous CDC materials through an in situ electrochemical etching process. Therefore, considering electrons can be generated from green/renewable energy sources such as solar energy and wind energy, this method also has significant potential to provide a sustainable route for CO2 conversion and porous CDCs synthesis (Fig. S21†).
During the high temperature (∼800–1000 °C) molten salt electrochemical etching process, Si can be electrochemically extracted from SiC and then removed through the molten salt, which means that the molten salt can penetrate into the porous structure and thus contribute to the formation of mesopores. Generally, the molten salt electrochemical etching process can be influenced by temperature, molten salt composition, etching potential, etc. Therefore, the characteristics of the CDCs, such as BET SSA, porosity, and pore structure are expected to be improved through optimization of further synthesis procedures. In particular, by using different molten salt systems such as CaCl2–NaCl, CaCl2–KCl, CaCl2–LiCl, etc., various CDC materials with different pore structures are expected to be produced at different temperatures. In addition, another attracting feature of the new molten salt-based electrochemical route is that the produced MCs and CDCs possess specific/distinct micro/nanostructures (such as homogeneous one-dimensional NW structures, dual-scale nanostructures, mesoporous structures, etc.), which are hard to achieve by other methods. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that these CDCs can be used in various applications, including supercapacitors.56–58
3.3 Electrochemical behavior of SiC-CDC NWs
To evaluate the electrochemical behavior of the synthesized SiC-CDC NWs as supercapacitor electrode materials and compare with the previous study,10 the performance of the supercapacitor electrode was assessed by CV and galvanostatic charge–discharge tests in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Fig. 5 shows the electrochemical properties of the as-synthesized SiC-CDC NWs for supercapacitor applications. Fig. 5a shows the typical CV curves of the as-synthesized SiC-CDC NWs at various scan rates ranging from 10 mV s−1 to 500 mV s−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 5a, all the CV curves exhibit a perfect rectangular shape from 0–1.0 V without obvious redox peaks even at a high scan rate of 500 mV s−1, indicating the ideal capacitive behavior, the specific capacitance originated from double-layer capacitance based on ion adsorption–desorption.10Fig. 5b shows the total galvanostatic charge–discharge curves measured at different current densities ranging from 1 A g−1 to 10 A g−1, in which all curves exhibit nearly triangular shapes. The symmetric linear charge and discharge curves with negligible voltage drop demonstrate a low internal resistance and an ideal capacitive behavior, indicating their excellent double layer capacitance behavior. The calculated specific capacitance of the SiC-CDC NWs is 260 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, which is significantly higher than the maximum specific capacitance of the CDCs synthesized by chlorination of MCs in the previous study.59,60 Compared to the corrugated graphene sheets produced in molten LiCl–KCl,10 the SiC-CDC NWs with mesopores produced in this work also exhibit higher specific capacitance. In order to further confirm that the unique dual-scale nanostructures with mesopores are beneficial to its high performance as supercapacitor electrode materials, we test carbon NWs without mesopores as supercapacitor electrode materials, and its specific capacitance is only 112 F g−1, as shown in Fig. S22.† In addition, when the specific capacitance (176 F g−1) of the SiC-CDC nanospheres produced in molten salts61 is compared to those of other typical carbon materials (Table S1†), it is further confirmed that the one-dimensional NW structure and the mesopores contribute to the high performance of the synthesized SiC-CDC NWs. It is reasonable to believe that the one-dimensional structure is beneficial for electron transport and the dual-scale nanostructures can provide a reduced ion/electron diffusion path.7 Furthermore, the SiC-CDC NW electrode delivered high specific capacitances of 200, 125, and 95 F g−1 at current densities of 2, 5, and 10 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 5c). Fig. 5d shows that 97.9% of the initial capacitance is retained after 5000 cycles. These results suggest that the as-prepared SiC-CDC NW electrode can deliver high capacitance and prolonged stability for supercapacitors.62 As a proof of concept, SiC-CDC has been selected as example in this work to demonstrate and propose a new strategy for the synthesis of mesoporous CDC materials with dual-scale nanostructures for supercapacitors, and more optimization details and electrochemical performance are currently being investigated. Considering the electroreduction and electrochemical etching processes can be carried out in different molten salts under different temperatures, optimization of the procedures and introduction of dopants are expected to further improve the electrochemical properties of the produced porous CDC materials.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a simple one-step method for electrosynthesis of mesoporous SiC-CDC NWs with dual-scale nanostructures in molten salts without using any template and catalyst has been demonstrated. This electrochemical method consumes only electrons to directly convert SiO2/C into SiC NWs through molten salt electroreduction and dissolution–electrodeposition processes, and then the SiC NWs can be further electrochemically etched to SiC-CDC NWs with mesopores in molten salts. The method and the synthesized one-dimensional mesoporous SiC-CDC NWs have advantages as follows: (i) the molten salt electrochemical etching process is beneficial for creating mesopores; (ii) the mesopores formed in molten salts can be easily wetted and guarantee that electrolyte has rapid access to the complete surface of SiC-CDC NWs; (iii) the one-dimensional features are beneficial for electron transport; (iv) dual-scale nanostructures can provide a reduced ion/electron diffusion path. Owing to their unique structure, the synthesized mesoporous SiC-CDC NWs exhibit enhanced electrochemical properties with a reversible specific capacitance of 260 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and good cyclability (97.9% after 5000 cycles). In addition, this process has the potential to be extended to the synthesis of other micro/nanostructured mesoporous CDCs from inexpensive and abundantly available metal oxides/carbon precursors. Importantly, the novelty and relative simplicity of this method may also lead to new processes for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to value-added porous CDC materials, which thus can provide impetus to consume the greenhouse gas to mitigate climate change.
