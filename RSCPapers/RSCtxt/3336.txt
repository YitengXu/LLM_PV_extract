    , Accepted 19th November 2015First published on 20th November 2015AbstractWe describe a new facile chemical route for the synthesis of hierarchical mesoporous α-MnO2 and the development of an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor. The hierarchical α-MnO2 is synthesized by the thermodynamically favorable redox reaction between metallic Zn and MnO4− in mild acidic solutions without any template. Zn and the in situ generated nascent hydrogen efficiently reduce MnO4− to MnO2. The growth mechanism is studied with time-dependent electron microscopic measurements. The α-MnO2 has a three-dimensional (3D) flower-like mesoporous hierarchical structure with an average size of 500 nm and a large surface area (206 m2 g−1) with a pore size of 48.34 Å and a pore volume of 0.543 cm3 g−1. It has significantly high electronic conductivity with respect to traditional/commercial MnO2. A specific capacitance as high as 322 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 with excellent cycling stability (90% after 8000 cycles) is achieved. An aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is developed by pairing α-MnO2 and reduced graphene oxide-based electrodes. An ASC could deliver a specific capacitance of 63.5 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 with a potential window of 0–2 V. The ASC retains 100% initial specific capacitance even after 3000 continuous charge–discharge cycles. It has an energy density of 35.28 W h kg−1 at a power density of 2.0 kW kg−1 and could retain 27.78 W h kg−1 at a power density of 16.67 kW kg−1. The three-dimensional mesoporous structure favors the facilitated transport of the electrolyte across the electrode. The post-mortem XRD analysis shows that the MnO2 nanostructure retains its initial α phase even after 3000 charge–discharge cycles, though a partial disintegration of the hierarchical structure was observed.
1. Introduction
The development of energy storage devices of high energy density and long life cycle is one of the pressing needs of the automotive and electronic industries. The renewable energy sources (solar, wind, etc.) of low emission are limited by time and an ideal energy storage system is critically required to assure a balanced power supply. Batteries and supercapacitors are very promising for the storage of energy generated from the renewable sources. In the recent years, supercapacitors, complementary energy storage devices to batteries, have received significant attention though they have low energy densities compared to batteries.1 The ultrahigh power density, fast charge–discharge, long life cycle and safety are the fascinating features of supercapacitors.2,3 They can be conveniently coupled with energy conversion devices such as fuel cells to serve as an efficient energy storage system for continuous power supply.4 They can also serve as a stand-alone energy supply system for many applications.1 Based on the charge storage mechanism, supercapacitors can be classified into two categories: (i) electrical double layer supercapacitors and (ii) pseudocapacitors. In the former case, the charge storage mechanism involves the adsorption of electrolyte ions at the electrode–solution interface. On the other hand, in the case of pseudocapacitors, the energy storage involves the charge transfer at the electrode–solution interface.
The energy density of a supercapacitor mainly depends on the nature of electrode materials. Several attempts have been made in the past to develop materials that are capable of delivering high energy density.1 Carbon, transition metal oxides and conducting polymer-based materials have been traditionally used. The use of a conductive ordered/disordered mesoporous material of a large surface area is a promising approach to enhance the energy density of supercapacitors.5–8 It has been demonstrated that the ordered mesoporous carbon based materials have superior capacitive performance.5–10 Facilitated electron and ion transport, high electronic conductivity, large surface area, etc. are the primary requirements of the electrode material for high energy supercapacitors.11–13 Among the transition metal oxides, MnO2-based materials are very attractive as they are cost-effective, environmental friendly and they can be synthesized on a large scale.14 Although MnO2 has an excellent theoretical capacitance of 1370 F g−1, the poor electronic conductivity of MnO2 limits the facilitated ion/electron transport and hence a poor capacitive performance.14 Various strategies have been used to improve the capacitive performances of MnO2.15–24 Conductive carbon has been widely used along with MnO2 to enhance the capacitive performance. For instance, MnO2 nanowires deposited onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) could deliver a specific capacitance of 167.5 F g−1 at a current density of 77 mA g−1.25 Very recently, Li et al. reported the supercapacitive performance of the CNT–MnO2 composite electrode with a specific capacitance of 201 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability.26 The CNT–MnO2 based supercapacitor electrodes could deliver specific capacitances ranging from 100–300 F g−1, depending on the current density/sweep rate.26–28 In the recent years, nanostructured MnO2 based composite materials with graphene/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and rGO/CNT–MnO2 composite electrodes have also been studied for supercapacitor applications.29–32 It is generally accepted that materials which favor facilitated ion/electron transport and have high electronic conductivity and minimum diffusion length would deliver high specific capacitance. Facilitated ion transport and short diffusion length can be achieved with materials of very small size and conductive hierarchical mesoporous 3D nanostructures. The mesoporous structures can significantly decrease the ion transport limitations and enhance the supercapacitive performance. Traditionally, porous hierarchical nanostructures have been synthesized using templates such as surfactants and by controlling the growth kinetics. Only handful of reports describe the synthesis of mesoporous MnO2 without any template.33–37 The hydrothermal procedures have been often employed to obtain mesoporous MnO2 nanostructures.33,35 Herein, for the first time, we describe a novel non-hydrothermal and template-free route for the synthesis of 3D hierarchical mesoporous α-MnO2 and the development of an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor with excellent performance. Our method is simple, novel and we could obtain the hierarchical nanostructure in 2 h time. The performance of the ASC is evaluated in terms of specific capacitance, energy density, rate capability and recyclability.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and methods
Graphite, zinc powder, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVF) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All the other chemicals used in this investigation were of analytical grade and obtained from Merck, India. All the solutions were prepared with Millipore water (Milli-Q system).
2.2 Synthesis of mesoporous α-MnO2
In a typical procedure, 20 mg of KMnO4 was dissolved in 20 mL of 0.1 M H2SO4 solution. The required amount of Zn powder was added to the solution and stirred at room temperature for 2 h or until the metallic Zn was consumed completely. The thus obtained black colored mesoporous α-MnO2 was washed repeatedly with copious amounts of water and alcohol to remove the unreacted KMnO4 and Zn. MnO2 samples containing different atomic % of Zn/Zn(II) was obtained by controlling the initial amount of metallic Zn in the reaction vessel.
2.3 Synthesis of rGO
Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared by the exfoliation of graphite using the modified Hummers' method.12,38 GO was reduced to rGO by refluxing with ethylene glycol at 180 °C for 3 h. The black colored rGO was washed extensively with water and dried in the vacuum for an hour.
2.4 Electrode preparation
The working electrode was prepared by mixing mesoporous α-MnO2 (80%) with acetylene black (15%) and PVF (5%) dissolved in NMP in a mortar pestle. The obtained slurry was then uniformly coated on a nickel foil current collector and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The loading of mesoporous α-MnO2 onto the current collector was optimized and high specific capacitance was obtained at a loading of 1 mg cm−2. The rGO based electrode was prepared by mixing with a PVF binder in 9:1 weight ratio in NMP solvent. All electrochemical experiments were performed under an inert atmosphere and Na2SO4 (1 M) was used as an electrolyte. The ASC was developed by pairing the α-MnO2 with a rGO-based anode. Circular wafers (diameter: 1.0 cm, thickness: 200 μm) of the electrode material were obtained by pressing at a pressure of 5 kPa. The mass of α-MnO2 in the circular wafer was 0.8 mg (∼1 mg cm−2). The mass ratio of the two electrode materials in the ASC was calculated from the charge balance of the two electrodes, following our previous method (ESI†).12 A separator soaked in 1 M Na2SO4 was placed between the two electrodes and then it was placed in a stainless steel split flat cell for capacitance measurements. For post-mortem analysis of the electrode material, mesoporous α-MnO2 was mixed with the PVF binder in a ratio of 9:1 in NMP solvent and coated over the Ni foil. Acetylene black was not added for better understanding of the changes in the morphology. The electrode material on the current collector was subjected to 3000 charge–discharge cycles and then used in the post-mortem analysis.
2.5 Capacitance measurement
The specific capacitance of the three- and two-electrode system was calculated from the charge–discharge profile using the following equation:2,39,40 (1)where Cs is the specific capacitance of the electrode material or the supercapacitor device; id is the applied constant current density during charge and discharge; Δtd is the time taken for complete discharge and ΔV is the potential window for discharge. Coulombic efficiency of the electrode was calculated from the following eqn (2)41 (2)where Δtc is the time taken for complete charge. Energy density (E) and power density (P) were calculated using eqn (3) and (4)2,39,40 (3) (4)
2.6 Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed with a FEI-TECNAI G2 20S TWIN electron microscope operating at a voltage of 200 kV. A carbon coated copper grid was used for sample preparation. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis was performed using a FEI NOVA NANOSEM 450, and mapping analysis was carried out with a BRUKER EDS microanalyzer attached to the FESEM instrument. XRD profiles were acquired with a BRUKER D8 advance unit using Cu-Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) radiation. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out with a PHI 5000 Versaprobe II scanning XPS microscope using Al as the energy source (Kα, hν = 1486.6 eV). Raman spectroscopic measurements were taken using a Jobin Yvon Horiba T64000 spectrometer (France) with an excitation source of an argon krypton mixed ion gas laser (488 nm, Spectra Physics, USA). For conductivity measurements, the α-MnO2 powder sample was dispersed in NMP (1 mg mL−1) and sonicated for 1 h. After sonication, a uniform ink was formed and it was coated over a glass slide. The film on the glass slide was dried in a vacuum oven overnight. The conductivity measurement of the film was performed by a van der Pauw 4 probe electrical measurement technique using a ECOPIA HMS-3000 Hall measurement unit. All the electrochemical experiments were performed with a Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat (302N) with computer controlled NOVA software in a single compartment three-electrode electrochemical cell with Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as a reference and Pt foil as counter electrodes. The stainless steel split flat cell (MTI Corporation) was used in the capacitance measurement of the ASC.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and material characterization
Our synthetic method involves the thermodynamically favourable Zn-mediated reduction of KMnO4 in aqueous acidic solution at room temperature (Scheme 1). The reduction potential of Zn(II)/Zn (−0.76 V) and MnO4−/MnO2 (1.76 V) redox couples suggests that MnO4− can be conveniently reduced to MnO2 by metallic Zn under optimized conditions. Zn metal can undergo two parallel reactions in aqueous acidic solution containing MnO4− ions: (i) facile reduction of MnO4− to low valent Mn species including MnO2 and (ii) reduction of proton and the evolution of nascent hydrogen. It is worth pointing out here that although the E0 of H+/H2 is lower than that of MnO4−/MnO2, simultaneous reduction of MnO4− as well as H+ was observed (both reactions have negative ΔG). The in situ generated nascent hydrogen is capable of efficiently reducing MnO4− to MnO2. In the presence of optimized amounts of Zn and H+ ions, MnO4− has been quantitatively reduced to MnO2. The evolution of nascent hydrogen was clearly seen with the naked eye in the reaction vessel. The evolution of nascent hydrogen and the dissolution of Zn favor the growth of porous MnO2 nanostructures as shown in Scheme 1. Our method is simple and superior to the existing method42 as it does not require any templates or surfactants and the growth of MnO2 was achieved at room temperature in 2 h time (Table S1†).
 Scheme 1  Zn-mediated reduction of KMnO4 and growth of mesoporous MnO2. 
The electron microscopic images show the growth of hierarchical 3D flower-like MnO2 structures with an average size of 500 nm (Fig. 1). It is obvious from the magnified image that the hierarchical structure is actually made of the assembly of crumbled nanosheets of thickness ∼ 5 nm. The nanosheets are crumpled and disorderly interconnected, making the material highly porous. The high resolution TEM image shows a fringe spacing of 4.9, 3.5, 3 and 2.5 Å, corresponding to the (200), (220), (310) and (400) planes, respectively, of α-MnO2 (ESI 1†). The growth mechanism was investigated by time-dependent electron microscopy measurements at different time intervals of the reaction. The reaction between Zn and MnO4− is very fast in acidic solution and it is rather difficult to separate the product from the reaction mixture at the initial stage (<15 min) of the reaction. A brownish black color was noticed immediately after the addition of Zn into the reaction mixture, suggesting the instant reduction of MnO4− to MnO2. To understand the growth mechanism the product of the reaction was collected at different time intervals (∼15 and 60 min) and the corresponding TEM and FESEM images are shown in Fig. 2 and ESI 2.† As can be seen that the α-MnO2 nanostructures obtained at 15 min of the reaction have a hierarchical morphology with sizes ranging from 150–300 nm (Fig. 2a–c), which is much smaller than the final product obtained after 2 h of the reaction (500 nm). The TEM image and the EDS profile obtained at 15 min shows the presence of unreacted Zn (Fig. 2a–c and ESI 3†). On the other hand, the α-MnO2 nanostructures obtained at 60 min of the reaction are larger in size (∼400 nm). No signature for the presence of Zn was obtained after 60 min of the reaction, suggesting that the Zn metal is consumed during the reaction. Both the Zn and the in situ generated nascent hydrogen effectively reduce MnO4− to MnO2. With time the MnO2 nanostructure further grew and attained the size of ∼500 nm at the completion of the reaction (2 h). No further change in the size and surface morphology was noticed after 2 h of the reaction. The reaction requires a minimum amount of acid and it does not proceed in the absence of acid.

The X-ray diffraction profile (Fig. 3) shows characteristic diffraction for the (200), (310), (211), (521) and (002) planes of α-MnO2 (JCPDS file no. 44-0141). All these diffractions are in excellent agreement with the electron microscopy measurements (ESI 1†). The XPS profile of MnO2 shows the signature of the elements C, O, Mn and Zn (Fig. 4). The Mn 2p signal appears at a binding energy of 653.7 (2p3/2) and 642.1 (2p1/2) eV with an energy separation of 11.78 eV, which is in accordance with that reported in the literature.15–17,43 On the other hand, the Mn 3s signal appears at the binding energy of 88.32 and 83.51 eV with an energy separation of 4.81 eV (Fig. 4).15,43 The XPS signal for Zn is due to the presence of trace amounts of Zn used in the reaction (vide supra). The α-MnO2 is known to exhibit two diagnostic Raman spectral bands in the high frequency region corresponding to the Ag mode. In our case, the Raman spectral profile (ESI 4†) shows an intense peak ∼650 cm−1 due to the symmetric stretching vibration of the MnO6 octahedra (Mn–O bond).44,45 The peak appears at 575 cm−1 which corresponds to the stretching vibration of the basal plane of MnO2.46 It should be mentioned here that the MnO2-based material is known to undergo laser-induced structural changes during the Raman measurement due to local heating.46 The other weak bands observed could be due to the structural changes during the measurement.

The surface area and porosity of the material were examined with adsorption–desorption experiments using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method (Fig. 5). The adsorption–desorption profile indicates that α-MnO2 has a type IV isotherm, suggesting the mesoporous nature of the material. The pore size analysis performed using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method shows that α-MnO2 has a very narrow pore size with an average pore diameter of 48.34 Å. The average pore volume was estimated to be 0.543 cm3 g−1. It has a very large specific surface area of 206 m2 g−1, which is significantly higher than the commercial MnO2 (ref. 47) and MnO2 nanostructure reported in the literature42,48 (Table S1†). As our α-MnO2 is mesoporous and has a very large specific surface area it is very promising for supercapacitor applications.

The commercial/traditional MnO2 has very poor electrical conductivity (10−6 to 10−5 S cm−1) and it significantly limits the power performance and rate capability, though MnO2 has very high theoretical specific capacitance.14,49 Our as-synthesized hierarchical mesoporous α-MnO2 in the absence of any additive has a conductivity of 7.29 × 10−4 S cm−1, which is significantly higher than the commercial MnO2. Such high conductivity assures enhanced supercapacitive performance. The high electrical conductivity may be ascribed to the presence of trace amounts of Zn or Zn(II) ions in the tunnels. The crystal structure of α-MnO2 has [1 × 1] and [2 × 2] tunnels (Scheme 2) along the c-axis of the tetragonal unit cell.48 Both the [1 × 1] and [2 × 2] tunnels can accommodate Zn or Zn(II). The reversible intercalation of Zn(II) into the tunnels of α-MnO2 is well known in the chemistry of rechargeable Zn ion batteries.50–52 The amount of Zn/Zn(II) was quantified from the XPS and EDS measurements and was very less with respect to the other elements (ESI 5†). The atomic % of Zn/Zn(II) was obtained from the EDS and XPS profiles and was 0.98% (ESI 5† and Fig. 4). In the XPS profile, the Zn 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks appear at the binding energy of 1041 and 1021 eV, respectively, further confirming the presence of Zn. In order to further understand the effect of the Zn/Zn(II) content in the conductivity, three different α-MnO2 samples with varying atomic % of Zn/Zn(II) have been synthesized. It was observed that the amount of Zn/Zn(II) significantly influences the conductivity of the samples. An increase in the conductivity while increasing the atomic % Zn was noticed (Table S2†).

3.2 Electrochemical studies
The supercapacitive performance of mesoporous α-MnO2 was examined by cyclic voltammetric, charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance measurements in three and two-electrode configurations in 1 M Na2SO4. The as-synthesized mesoporous α-MnO2 was mixed with acetylene black and PVF to prepare the electrode. Nickel foil was used as the conducting substrate to support the electrode material in the three-electrode electrochemical studies. Fig. 6a represents the typical voltammetric response of mesoporous α-MnO2 with the three-electrode configuration. The rectangular shaped voltammetric response with a potential window of 0–1 V was obtained, indicating the capacitive behaviour of the electrode material. The charge storage in the MnO2-based materials is associated either with the intercalation/de-intercalation or with the surface adsorption/desorption of protons/alkali cations inside the tunnels of the α-MnO2 crystal (Scheme 2).53 In the case of thin film electrodes, the oxidation state of Mn changes between III and IV during the charge–discharge process.53 However, in the case of thicker composite electrodes, only the surface layer of the electrode involves in the charge storage process and no change in the oxidation state was noticed.53 In our case, the charge storage mechanism is believed to involve the surface adsorption/desorption of electrolyte cations due to the mesoporous nature of α-MnO2. The cyclic voltammetric response at a slow scan rate of 2 mV s−1 shows a broad ill-defined anodic and cathodic wave in the potential range of 450–600 mV (ESI 6†), suggesting the possible intercalation/de-intercalation of metal cations during the electrode reaction. The specific capacitance was measured from the charge–discharge curves (Fig. 6b) and was 322 F g−1. To further evaluate the performance of the material, the electrochemical impedance measurements were performed at apotential of 0.5 V (Ag/AgCl). Interestingly, in the high frequency region, a near vertical Warburg line with a rapid increase in Zim along the Y axis was observed. Such impedance features indicate the ideal capacitive behaviour of the electrode and the free diffusion of ions through the porous structure of α-MnO2. The charge transfer resistance was calculated to be 7.6 Ω (ESI 7†). The rate capability was evaluated by measuring the capacitance at different current densities. The electrode retains >80% of its initial capacitance obtained at 1 A g−1 even at 20 A g−1 (ESI 8†). The excellent rate capability is due to the decrease in the dynamic resistance of the electrolyte ions within the 3D mesoporous structure, which provide channels for the free transportation of electrolyte ions.54 The cycling stability was tested by 8000 repeated charge–discharge cycles at a high current density of 20 A g−1 (Fig. 6d). Interestingly, our mesoporous α-MnO2 could retain 90% of the initial specific capacitance even after 8000 repeated cycles. The α-MnO2 electrode retains 100% of its initial capacitance even after 3000 continuous charge–discharge cycles due to the presence of the mesoporous 3-dimensional network structure, highlighting the remarkable recyclability of the material. Moreover, it retains >95% efficiency during the extensive cycles. It is worth pointing out here that the amount of Zn/Zn(II) present in the sample influences the specific capacitance of α-MnO2. For instance, enhancement in the specific capacitance was noticed while increasing the Zn content from 0.45 to 0.98 atomic %. Further increase in the Zn content does not improve the capacitive performance (Table S2†). The mesoporous nature, large surface area and high electronic conductivity of α-MnO2 contribute to the enhancement of the overall performance.

The plot illustrating the specific capacitance and columbic efficiency retention during 8000 charge–discharge cycles is shown in (d). 
To understand the effect of extensive charge–discharge cycles on the surface structure and morphology, if any, of the electrode material, post-mortem analysis was performed with TEM and XRD measurements after 3000 cycles at a current density of 20 A g−1. The post-mortem TEM analysis of the α-MnO2 electrode after 3000 charge–discharge cycles shows the partial disintegration of the initial hierarchical 3D flower-like structure (Fig. 7a and b). The careful analysis of the HRTEM image (Fig. 7c) shows that the MnO2 retains its original α phase; lattice fringe spacings of 4.9 and 3.01 Å, corresponding to the (200) and (301) plane of α-MnO2 was observed (Fig. 7c). This was further confirmed by XRD analysis; all the diffraction patterns are assigned to α-MnO2 (Fig. 7d). Although partial disintegration of the 3-D hierarchical structure and an observable decrease in the particle size was observed after the charge–discharge cycles, the MnO2 retains its original α phase. The change in the % retention of specific capacitance after 3000 cycles (Fig. 6a and b) could be due to the partial disintegration of the α-MnO2 structure. It is interesting to note that the MnO2 nanostructure has the hierarchical structure even after extensive cycles, though it is partially disintegrated.

To further evaluate the capacitive performance of the material, the ASC was made by pairing α-MnO2 with a rGO anode using a stainless steel split flat cell. rGO was prepared from GO according to the procedure reported elsewhere55 and characterized by FTIR, XRD and XPS analyses (ESI 9†). rGO was rationally selected to pair with α-MnO2 as it has wide potential window, high electronic conductivity and mechanical strength. As the α-MnO2 sample containing 0.98% of Zn exhibits high specific capacitance, it was used in the fabrication of the ASC. The rectangular shaped voltammetric response with a wide potential window of 0 to 2 V was obtained (Fig. 8). It is interesting to note that we could achieve a potential window of 2 V in aqueous solution with the α-MnO2 and rGO based ASC. Our MnO2-based electrode could be polarized up to 1.2 V (NHE) in neutral pH due to high oxygen overpotential. Similarly our rGO-based electrode could be polarized up to −0.8 V (NHE) due to hydrogen overpotential (ESI 10†). Consequently we could achieve a practical cell voltage of 2 V in aqueous solution. This is in accordance with the earlier literature.56 The specific capacitance was calculated from the charge–discharge curves and the device shows a specific capacitance of 63.5 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. The energy density of the device was calculated to be 35.28 W h kg−1 at a power density of 2.0 kW kg−1 and could also retain 27.78 W h kg−1 at a power density of 16.67 kW kg−1. The energy and power density of our device are higher than those of the existing MnO2-based ASC57,58 (Table S3†). It is worth pointing out here that the device could retain 100% of its initial specific capacitance even after 3000 repeated charge–discharge cycles at high current density of 10 A g−1, highlighting its excellent cycling stability (Fig. 8c, ESI 11†). The superior performance of the ASC can be ascribed to the enhanced accessibility of the material to the electrolyte due to the mesoporous 3D structure.

It is worth comparing the electrochemical performance of our hierarchical α-MnO2 with the existing porous/mesoporous MnO2-based electrodes in terms of specific capacitance, energy density, rate capability, cycling stability, etc. (Tables S3 and S4†). The existing MnO2-based electrodes show specific capacitance ranging from 180 to 460 F g−1, depending on the current density (0.1–6 A g−1) or scan rate (1–5 mV s−1) in aqueous neutral solution.36,59,60 The rate capability of most of the MnO2-based electrodes is rather poor; >40% decrease in the initial capacitance was noticed at a current density 10–20 A g−1.36,59–62 The cycling stability is one of the main parameters that decide the practical utility of a material for device fabrication. A significant loss of the initial specific capacitance after extensive charge–discharge cycles has been observed. For instance, 20–30% decrease in the initial specific capacitance after 3000 cycles at a current density of 5–10 A g−1 has been observed.59,62,63 Wu and co-workers achieved superior cycling stability (>94% after 10000 to 23000 cycles) with NaxMnO2, KxMnO2 and MnO2 nanorod-based ASCs, though the energy density is rather low (17 W h kg−1 at 2 kW kg−1).57,58,64,65 In our case, we have achieved an energy density of 35.28 W h kg−1 at 2 kW kg−1 with the ASC. Our electrode could retain 80% of the initial capacitance even at 20 A g−1 and it has very good cycling stability; more than 90% of the capacitance was retained after 8000 extensive charge–discharge cycles at a high current density of 20 A g−1 in three-electrode configuration. Our ASC retains 100% of the initial capacitance after 3000 charge–discharge cycles. The superior performance can be ascribed to the 3D hierarchical structure of the materials.
The examination of self-discharge characteristics of a supercapacitor is important to evaluate the performance of an ASC for practical applications. The self-discharge of the device largely depends on the nature of the electrode materials, purity of the electrolyte, etc. The loss of charge can be due to the diffusion of charge and restructuring of electrolyte ions inside the electrode material. It is generally accepted that the self-discharge mechanism can be of faradaic or ohmic.2,66 In the faradaic type mechanism, the charge redistribution and presence of impurities actually cause the loss of charge. We have evaluated the self-discharge characteristics of the ASC prepared with the three different α-MnO2 samples containing varying amounts of Zn (ESI 12†). As our study is of fundamental interest, the discharge profile was acquired only for period of 15000 s. It was found that the device made with the α-MnO2 sample containing large amounts of Zn undergoes fast discharge whereas slow discharge was noticed for the samples containing less amounts of Zn. The plot of V against the square root of t is near linear, suggesting that the mechanism of discharge could be due to the presence of the Zn impurity.2,66
4. Conclusion
The facile reduction of Mn(VII) using metallic Zn and the growth of nanocrystalline mesoporous α-MnO2 with a 3D flower-like structure with a large surface area for the development of a high energy density aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor are demonstrated. Our synthetic method is rapid and the mesoporous structure was achieved at room temperature without any templates. The reduction of MnO4− was achieved by its thermodynamically favourable reaction with Zn and the in situ generated nascent hydrogen. The electronic conductivity of α-MnO2 is higher than the traditional commercial MnO2. The porous morphology and the large surface area of α-MnO2 favor the easy transportation of electrolyte ions thus leading to its excellent supercapacitive performance. Our mesoporous α-MnO2 with the high specific capacitance, remarkable recyclability and rate capability outperforms the conventional α-MnO2 nanoparticles. A high energy density ASC was fabricated by pairing the mesoporous α-MnO2 with a rGO anode and it shows excellent cycling stability with 100% retention of the capacitance even after 3000 repeated charge–discharge cycles.
