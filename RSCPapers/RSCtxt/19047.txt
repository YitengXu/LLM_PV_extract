    , Accepted 15th August 2018First published on 16th August 2018AbstractA series of pyrrolopyrrole aza boron dipyrromethene derivatives have been designed and synthesised as two-photon fluorescent probes. The bisalkynyl analogues, having a donor–π–donor quadrupolar skeleton, show a red-shifted Q band at ca. 700 nm in toluene and a two-photon absorption (TPA) cross-section up to 2349 GM at 1040 nm. To enable these dyes to be used for subcellular imaging, a branched oligoethylene glycol unit has been introduced to enhance their hydrophilicity and biocompatibility, and a potential organelle-selective group, namely triphenylphosphonium or morpholine moiety has also been added with a view to targeting the mitochondria or lysosomes respectively. The resulting conjugates are essentially non-aggregated in deionised water, exhibiting an intense Q band at 668 nm and a TPA cross-section up to 384 GM at 1040 nm. These spectral features have been analysed using density functional theory calculations, which suggest that the TPA is mainly due to the S0 → S2 transition. In the subcellular imaging study, it has been found that the triphenylphosphonium-containing derivative can localise in the lysosomes of HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells, which may be a result of its positive charge and the negative logP value (−2.46, P = partition coefficient), while the morpholine-substituted analogue does not exhibit preferential subcellular localisation.
Introduction
There has been considerable interest in the development of near-infrared (NIR) absorbing and emitting dyes due to their broad range of applications, such as serving as emitters in light-emitting diodes,1 as sensitisers in dye-sensitised solar cells2 and as heat absorbers in paints and windows.1a In addition, NIR fluorescent materials are widely used in bioimaging as their spectral features can minimise the auto-fluorescent background of living cells, allow deeper light penetration into biological tissues and reduce photodamage.3 Being a versatile class of NIR dyes, extended boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) have attracted much attention owing to their superior characteristics, such as intense and tunable absorption and fluorescence emission, ease of chemical modifications and relatively high stability.4 Recently, a new class of BODIPY derivatives, namely pyrrolopyrrole cyanines (PPCys), have been prepared by condensation reaction of diketopyrolopyrroles with aromatic acetonitriles.5 These compounds exhibit strong NIR absorptions beyond 900 nm, high fluorescence quantum yields and high photostability. By introducing hydrophilic groups or biomolecules, or using polymeric micelles as carriers, these NIR materials have been explored as fluorescing pH indicators6 and biolabels,7 and for in vivo imaging.8 As a further modification, the methine carbon bridges can be replaced with imine groups. The resulting derivatives are regarded as pyrrolopyrrole aza-BODIPYs (PABDPs), of which the π-conjugated systems possess a higher coplanarity, thereby shifting the absorptions further to the red.9 The considerably rigid π-skeletons also promote the relaxation of the singlet excited states via fluorescence emission instead of through molecular motions. The efficiencies of these materials in organic photovoltaics,10 photoacoustic imaging11 and aggregation-induced emission fluorescence imaging12 have been briefly examined. We report herein an extension of these studies to two-photon-absorbing PABDP derivatives and their use for subcellular fluorescent imaging.
Two-photon absorption (TPA) is a third-order nonlinear optical process.13 Two-photon molecules can simultaneously absorb two photons to reach an excited state. The use of radiation with a longer wavelength allows a better three-dimensional spatial localisation, higher imaging resolution and increased penetration depth with extended observation time. As a result, they are particularly suitable for bioimaging applications.14 Over the last decade, a large number of two-photon dyes with various structural motifs have been developed and the structure–property relationship has been elucidated. Generally speaking, the TPA cross-section (σ(2)) value increases with the extent of charge transfer. Thus it is important to optimise the core, the donor–acceptor pair and the conjugated bridge to obtain a large σ(2) value.
Among the bioimaging applications, selective imaging of subcellular organelles is of particular interest. A deeper understanding of the roles of and processes in certain subcellular organelles is crucial for revealing the pathologies of various diseases and for discovery of more potent medicines.15 This has stimulated the studies of selective fluorescent probes for subcellular organelles and some biologically important species in these compartments.16 Although there are a number of commercially available dyes for labelling different organelles, they have some practical limitations, such as the short excitation wavelength, low photostability and high cost. More importantly, further modifications cannot be made readily on these organelle-trackers to introduce additional functionalities. On this basis, we have extended the study of PABDP derivatives, focusing on their TPA property and potential application in subcellular imaging. The results are reported in detail below.
Results and discussion
Molecular design and synthesis
Being a common structural motif of TPA molecules, donor–π–donor (D–π–D) quadrupoles usually show high TPA cross-sections.13,14 Therefore, we first prepared two novel PABDP derivatives possessing this skeleton. As shown in Scheme 1, the diketopyrrolopyrrole 3 was first prepared by the Stobbe-like condensation of 4-heptyloxybenzonitrile (1) with diisopropylsuccinate (2) in the presence of sodium in tert-amylalcohol.5a For the electron donors, we employed 4-(dimethylamino)phenylethynyl and 4-(diphenylamino)phenylethynyl moieties, which can also extend the π-conjugation of the PABDP core. Hence, treatment of 2-amino-5-iodopyridine (4) with alkyne 5 or 617 under typical Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction conditions led to the formation of the corresponding alkynyl aminopyridine 7 or 8. Following the procedure described by Shimizu and co-workers,9a the diketopyrrolopyrrole 3 was condensed with aminopyridine 7 or 8 in the presence of TiCl4 and Et3N in refluxing toluene. It was then followed by complexation with BF3·OEt2 to give PABDP 9 and 10, which could be purified readily by column chromatography.

With a large hydrophobic π-conjugated system, these compounds were not soluble in aqueous media. To facilitate the application of these dyes in subcellular imaging, a branched oligoethylene glycol unit was introduced because of its high hydrophilicity and biocompatibility, as well as the non-ionic nature that can generally promote cellular uptake. In addition, the branched structure can increase the bulkiness to prevent stacking of the PABDP molecules, which will quench the photoactivities of the dyes through internal conversion. With a view to directing the dyes to the mitochondria or lysosomes, which are two of the most important subcellular organelles, a triphenylphosphonium or morpholine moiety was incorporated to the PABDP core. The former is a lipophilic cation which is widely used to deliver small molecules into the mitochondria driven by the large mitochondrial membrane potential,15d while the latter is a lipophilic amine that can be activated and trapped in the lysosomes.18 Owing to the lack of additional reaction sites, the electron-donating groups cannot be retained for this series of compounds.

Scheme 2 shows the synthetic route for these hydrophilic PABDPs. Treatment of 3 with the alkynyl aminopyridine 1119 instead of 7 and 8 as described above gave PABDP 12 in 37% yield. The trimethylsilyl (TMS) groups of 12 were then removed upon treatment with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF). The resulting bisalkynyl PABDP 13 was then treated with one equiv. of the azido branched oligoethylene glycol 1420 for 4–5 h under copper-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition reaction conditions, and then two equiv. of the azido triphenylphosphonium salt 1521 or morpholine 1622 was added. The reactions were allowed to proceed for a further 4–5 h, from which the unsymmetrical PABDP 17 and 18 were isolated by column chromatography in 35–36% yield. By using an excess amount of 14 (4 equiv.) and extending the reaction time to 8 h in the absence of 17 and 18, the symmetrical PABDP 19 was isolated in 64% yield as a control compound. All the compounds (except 3) possessed good solubility in common organic solvents and were characterised with various spectroscopic methods. Owing to the poor solubility, the diketopyrrolopyrrole 3 could not be characterised and was used directly for further reaction.

One-photon and two-photon spectral properties
The electronic absorption spectra of 9 and 10 in toluene (Fig. 1a) showed a broad B band at ca. 350 nm and an intense Q band at ca. 690 nm. The latter was significantly red-shifted compared with the Q-band absorption of the analogue without the two alkynyl moieties (compound 20) reported by Shimizu and co-workers (638 nm in CHCl3)9a as a result of the extended conjugation. Upon excitation at 610 nm, these compounds showed a fluorescence emission at ca. 720 nm (Fig. 1b) with a Stokes shift of 480 (for 9) or 440 cm−1 (for 10). The fluorescence quantum yield (Φf) was largely reduced from 0.87 (for 20 in CHCl3) to 0.08 (for 9) and 0.14 (for 10). The relatively large Stokes shift and low fluorescence quantum yield reflect a substantial intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) character in these compounds due to the two strongly electron-donating groups. The lower Φf value of 9 compared with that of 10 could be attributed to the stronger ICT effect induced by the dimethylamino group. These one-photon spectral data are summarised in Table 1.

The TPA properties of 9 and 10 were studied by using a two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) method in toluene with Rhodamine B as standard.23 The σ(2) values at different excitation positions (from 770 to 1200 nm) were measured. It was found that the TPA cross-sections reach 800 GM for 9 and 2349 GM for 10 at 1040 nm. The values are generally higher than those of the diketopyrrolopyrroles reported previously,24 which can be attributed to their D–π–D quadrupolar structure with two strong electron donors at the termini. It is worth noting that there was also a TPA maximum appearing at a much shorter wavelength (≤770 nm) than twice the wavelength of the one-photon absorption maximum of the lowest-energy electronic transition (at ca. 1390 nm), which may correspond to the B band at 340–360 nm. This behaviour is typical for centrosymmetric chromophores, for which one-photon allowed transitions are not allowed for two-photon transitions and vice versa.24 Upon two-photon excitation, these compounds exhibited two-photon photoluminescence (TPPL) at 715 nm (for 9) and 709 nm (for 10) (Table 1). The two-photon fluorescence brightness as shown by the value of σ(2)Φf, which reflects the imaging efficiency, was determined to be 64 GM (for 9) and 329 (for 10).
The high σ(2) values of 9 and 10 in the NIR region render these compounds as potential fluorescent probes for TPA applications. As a result, we extended the study to a series of hydrophilic analogues (compounds 17–19). These compounds could be dissolved in deionised water with 0.3% v/v Tween 80 and 1% v/v N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Under these conditions, these compounds gave typical absorption spectra of PABDPs, showing an intense Q-band at 668 nm (Fig. 2a), which strictly followed the Lambert Beer's law, suggesting that the aggregation of this series of compounds is not significant (Fig. S1–S3, ESI†). Upon excitation at 610 nm, these compounds emitted at 683 nm (Fig. 2b) with a fluorescence quantum yield of ca. 0.4 (Table 2).

Photobleaching is an unavoidable problem for most organic dyes that will compromise the temporal monitoring of dynamic events inside living cells. Hence, the photostability of these PABDPs was studied by irradiating the samples with a UV lamp (18 W, 254 nm) and monitoring the decrease in Q-band absorbance with time. It was found that the absorbance decreased by at most 20% after irradiation for 4 min (Fig. 2c). The photostability of these compounds was significantly higher than that of the commercially available NIR dye IR-780 iodide. The results suggest that these compounds possess desirable features for bioimaging applications.
The TPA spectra of 17–19 in this aqueous medium were also measured using a TPEF method from 800 nm to 1500 nm. These spectra are given in Fig. 3, which also displays the one-photon absorption (OPA) spectra for comparison. All the compounds showed a maximum TPA cross-section (334–459 GM, Table 2) at 1040 nm, of which the correlated one-photon energy was higher than the energy of the corresponding S0 → S1 band. This might be due to the mutually exclusive selection rules for one- and two-photon transitions for centrosymmetric molecules.25 Apparently, the substituents at the triazole ring did not exert significant effect on the TPA property of the PABDP core. Hence, despite the fact that 17 and 18 are non-centrosymmetric, they behave similarly as the symmetrical counterparts (9, 10 and 19), for which the strongest TPA band was at higher energy, whereas the S0 → S1 transition could not be observed.
 Fig. 3  Two-photon (segmented lines) and one-photon (solid lines) absorption spectra of 17–19 in deionised water (with 0.3% v/v Tween 80 and 1% v/v DMF). 
To provide a solid theoretical basis for the interpretation of these results, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the analogue of 19 with reduced chain length (Fig. 4a). Geometric optimisations were first performed using the B3LYP/6-31G(d)/CPCM (water) in Gaussian 09 programme. For the simulation of the TPA cross-sections, various basis functions were tested using the ADF2017 programme, and the optimal results were obtained on the PBE/DZ basis condition. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the computed TPA cross-sections at 1000–1400 nm. The results were generally in good agreement with the experimental results, giving a maximum at 1150 nm (σ(2) = 372 GM) vs. 1040 nm (σ(2) = 459 GM) determined experimentally (Fig. 3 and Table 2). The error was about 0.1 eV.

To analyse the excited state of this model compound, its OPA spectrum was simulated by a time-dependent DFT method (Fig. S5, ESI†). The spectrum showed a large absorption band at 652 nm, which is attributed to the Q-band arising from the HOMO → LUMO transition, and corresponds to the S1 excited state. The S2 transition appeared at 469 nm, which corresponds to the HOMO−1 → LUMO transition. As shown in Fig. 4b, the HOMO of the model compound has a symmetry of au, whereas the HOMO−1 and LUMO have a symmetry of bg. The transition from HOMO to LUMO (au to bg) is allowed with OPA because it involves the inversion of symmetry. However, this is forbidden for TPA. Therefore, at around 1300 nm corresponding to TPA for S0 → S1, the intensity of TPA becomes remarkably weak. On the other hand, the transition from HOMO−1 to LUMO (bg to bg) is allowed for TPA because there is no change in the orbital symmetry. Therefore, the TPA of this PABDP is mainly due to the S0 → S2 transition (Fig. 4c).
Subcellular localisation studies
With desirable spectral features, these PABDPs were then examined for their potential use in subcellular fluorescence imaging. Fig. 5 and 6 show the confocal images of HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells after incubation with 17, 18 or 19 together with the MitoTracker Green or LysoTracker Green. By exciting the PABDPs at 633 nm, fluorescence could be observed inside the cells, indicating that all these PABDPs have membrane permeability and can accumulate inside the cells. However, the subcellular localisation property of these compounds was not fully expected. For 17, despite having a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium moiety, which is expected to lead to accumulation in the mitochondria, this compound did not localise in this organelle as shown by the co-localisation experiment with MitoTracker Green (first row of Fig. 5). This compound, however, could localise in the lysosomes of the cells. As shown in the first row of Fig. 6, the confocal images of 17 and the LysoTracker Green could be well superimposed. Also unexpectedly, the morpholine-containing PABDP 18 did not show the localisation effect in lysosomes (second row of Fig. 6). The reference compound 19 did not exhibit affinity towards the mitochondria and lysosomes of the cells (second row of Fig. 5 and third row of Fig. 6).

Panels (e and j) show the fluorescence intensity profiles of the PABDPs (in red) and MitoTracker Green (in green) traced along the red lines in the corresponding images on the left.

Panels (e), (j) and (o) show the fluorescence intensity profiles of the PABDPs (in red) and LysoTracker Green (in green) traced along the red lines in the corresponding images on the left. 
These unexpected results might be due to the large hydrophobic PABDP core that outweighs the effect of the targeting groups. As a matter of fact, it is the combined effect of several factors, including the number of charges and a balance between hydrophilicity and lipophilicity that determines the molecular probes’ selectivity towards certain subcellular organelles. Horobin and co-workers suggested that the partition coefficient (P) and the ionic charge (Z) of a molecule can be used to predict the molecular selectivity to organelles.26 According to the quantitative structure activity relations (QSAR) analysis, a molecule that has a logP value between −5 and 0 and a Z value greater than zero would preferentially localise in lysosomes.27 Hence, we determined the n-octanol/water partition coefficients of 17 and 18 using a spectrophotometric method. The logP values of 17 and 18 were found to be −2.46 and −0.97 respectively, indicating their hydrophilic character. The more negative logP value and the mono-cationic nature of 17 may explain its localisation effect in lysosomes, while for 18, both factors do not favour preferential localisation in this organelle. In addition, from the perspective of cellular uptake, since cell membrane consists of phospholipid bilayers which are highly lipophilic, lipophilic probes can enter the cells readily through diffusion. However, for hydrophilic molecules, especially the one with charges, the uptake is mainly through endocytosis, for which the destinations of the route are at the lysosomes.
To demonstrate that these PABDPs can be used as two-photon fluorescent probes in biological systems, we recorded the two-photon fluorescence images of HeLa cells stained with 19, which was used as an example. Fig. 7 shows the two-photon scanning microscopic image upon excitation at 800 nm together with the corresponding one-photon image (λex = 633 nm). Due to the different excitation power, the intracellular intensity could not be directly compared. Nevertheless, compared with one-photon imaging, this two-photon imaging technique enables long-term imaging of cellular processes and deep tissue penetration, and causes less photodamage because of the long-wavelength excitation. This feature could enhance the potential of PABDP dyes for bioimaging.

Conclusion
In summary, we have designed, synthesised and characterised a series of novel PABDP derivatives which have a D–π–D quadrupolar structure (compounds 9 and 10) or a hydrophilic character (compounds 17–19). With extended π-conjugation and two strong electron donors at the termini, the former two compounds show a strong Q-band absorption in the near-infrared region (ca. 700 nm) and a high TPA cross-section (up to 2349 GM at 1040 nm for 10). The latter three compounds are substituted with hydrophilic oligoethylene glycol chains, which enable them to be used as fluorescent probes for bioimaging. Their TPA cross-sections are in the range of 334–459 GM, which can be attributed to the S0 → S2 transition. Subcellular localisation study has revealed that the triphenylphosphonium-containing 17 can localise in the lysosomes of HeLa cells, which may be a result of its positive charge and negative logP value (−2.46), while the morpholine-substituted 18 and the control compound 19 do not exhibit preferential subcellular localisation. Two-photon excited fluorescence has also been observed for HeLa cells stained with 19. The overall results suggest that PABDPs, with appropriate chemical modifications, could serve as promising two-photon fluorescent dyes for bioimaging.
Experimental section
General
All the reactions were performed under an atmosphere of nitrogen. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was distilled from sodium benzophenone ketyl. Toluene and tert-amylalcohol were distilled from sodium. Et3N was dried over anhydrous CaSO4 followed by distillation. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was dried over barium oxide and distilled under reduced pressure. All other solvents and reagents were of reagent grade and used as received. All the reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) performed on Merck pre-coated silica gel 60 F254 plates. Chromatographic purification was performed on silica gel (Macherey-Nagel, 230–400 mesh) with the indicated eluents.

1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 400 spectrometer (1H, 400 MHz; 13C, 100.6 MHz) or a Bruker Avance III 700 spectrometer (1H, 700 MHz; 13C, 176.0 MHz) in CDCl3. Spectra were referenced internally by using the residual solvent (1H, δ = 7.26) or solvent (13C, δ = 77.16) resonances relative to SiMe4. Electrospray ionisation (ESI) mass spectra were recorded on a Thermo Finnigan MAT 95 XL or a Bruker SolariX 9.4T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer. Matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Daltonics Autoflex III spectrometer with trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile as the matrix. UV-Vis absorption and steady-state fluorescence spectra were taken on a Cary 5G UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer and a Hitachi F-7000 spectrofluorometer respectively. The fluorescence quantum yields of the samples (Φf(s)) were determined by the equation: Φf(s) = (Fs/Fref)(Aref/As)(ns2/nref2)Φf(ref),27 where subscript s refers to the sample solutions while ref stands for the reference. F, A and n are the measured fluorescence (area under the emission peak), the absorbance at the excitation position (610 nm) and the refractive index of the solvent respectively. The reported PABDP was used as the reference (Φf = 0.87 in CHCl3).9a

Study of photostability
The photostability of 17–19 and IR-780 iodide in deionised water (with 0.3% v/v Tween 80 and 1% v/v DMF) was studied using a home-built setup consisting of a 18 W UV lamp (254 nm) and a water filter for cooling. The concentration of samples was fixed at 2 μM. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 5G UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer every 10 s over a period of 4 min of illumination time.
TPA cross-section measurements
A TPEF method23 was applied to measure the TPA cross-sections. The excitation source for two-photon excitation for 9 and 10 was a femtosecond optical parametric oscillator system (Coherent Chameleon compact OPO) pumped by a Ti:sapphire oscillator (Coherent Chameleon) and then detected with a spectrometer (Acton SP300i) coupled to an CCD (Princeton Instrument PIXIS: 400). For 17–19, the excitation source was a femtosecond optical parametric amplifier (Coherent OPerA Solo) pumped by an amplified Ti:sapphire system (Coherent Legend Elite system) and then detected with a spectrometer (Spex 500M) coupled to an CCD. All of the sensing experiments were carried out using freshly prepared solutions, and the concentration of samples in toluene (for 9 and 10) or deionised water (with 0.3% v/v Tween 80 and 1% v/v DMF) (for 17–19) was fixed at 20 μM. After the TPEF emission spectra of the sample and the TPA standard were captured, the TPEF and TPA cross-sections were estimated using the following equations: σTPEF(s) = (Fs/Fref)(cref/cs) σTPEF(ref) and σTPA = σTPEF/ϕ, where σTPEF and σTPA are TPEF and TPA cross-sections respectively, subscript s refers to the sample solutions and ref stands for the reference, F refers to the integrated intensity of fluorescence spectra after being corrected with the instrumental spectral response function, and c stands for the molar concentration of fluorophores in the sample solutions. ϕ is one-photon excited fluorescence quantum efficiency, which is used here under the assumption that the fluorescence quantum efficiencies involved in one- and two-photon excited fluorescence are identical. Rhodamine B (40 μM) in methanol was used as the reference.
TPA simulation
The geometric optimisations were performed using the Gaussian 09 programme28 using DFT with the B3LYP functional and 6-31G(d) basis set. Solvation effects were included by means of the conductor-like polarisable continuum model (C-PCM) with water parameters. To reduce the computational cost of the simulations for TPA cross-sections, structural optimisations were performed on the model compound for 19 with reduced chain length. TPA simulations were tested with the ADF2017 programme.29 The two-photon matrix elements were computed with the DFT-based damped cubic response theory using the ADF2017 programme. The optimal results were obtained on the PBE/DZ basis condition. TPA cross-sections were derived based on the previous report30 for each excitation energy.
Determination of the partition coefficient
A shake-flask UV-Vis spectrophotometric method was used to determine the n-octanol/water partition coefficients of PABDPs 17 and 18. Firstly, standard solutions of these PABDPs (5 μM) were prepared in the water phase and organic phase. Solutions of these PABDPs (5 μM) were then prepared with a mixed solvent of n-octanol (5 mL) water (5 mL), which were shaken for 48 h. The concentrations of PABDPs in the water phase (Cw) and organic phase (Co) of these solutions were determined using UV-Vis spectrophotometry by comparing with the standard solutions. The n-octanol/water partition coefficient (P) was calculated by the equation: P = Co/Cw.
Cell lines and culture conditions
All the cell culture reagents were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA, unless otherwise specified. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 unit mL−1 penicillin and 100 μg mL−1 streptomycin) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.
One-photon confocal fluorescence microscopic studies
Approximately 6 × 104 HeLa cells in 2 mL of DMEM were incubated on 35 mm glass-bottom confocal dishes (MatTek Corporation, P35G-0-14-C) at 37 °C under 5% CO2 overnight. The cells were treated with PABDP 17, 18 or 19 in DMEM (2 μM, 2 mL) for 4 h. After being washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice, the cells were stained in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) with 0.5 μM MitoTracker Green FM (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., M7514) or 1.5 μM LysoTracker Green DND 26 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., L7526) at 37 °C for 20 min. After being washed with PBS twice, the cells were replenished with HBSS and observed using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8 high speed imaging system with CO2 incubator) with a 488 nm argon laser and a 633 nm helium-neon laser. All the trackers were excited at 488 nm, and their fluorescence was monitored at 500–570 nm, while the PABDPs were excited at 633 nm and their fluorescence was monitored at 650–760 nm.
Two-photon confocal fluorescence microscopic studies
Approximately 1 × 105 HeLa cells in 2 mL of DMEM were incubated on 35 mm glass-bottom confocal dishes (MatTek Corporation, P35G-0-14-C) at 37 °C under 5% CO2 overnight. The cells were treated with 19 in DMEM (4 μM, 2 mL) for 2 h. The cells were then rinsed with PBS (1 mL × 2) and observed using a Zeiss laser scanning microscope (LSM 880 NLO) equipped with a 633 nm laser (for one-photon excitation) and a 800 nm laser (for two-photon excitation). The fluorescence of 19 was monitored at 650–735 nm.
