    First published on 28th February 2022Abstract2D carbides and nitrides of transition metals, also known as MXenes, are an emerging class of 2D nanomaterials that have shown excellent performances and broad application prospects in the fields of energy storage, catalysis, sensing, electromagnetic shielding, electronics and photonics, and life sciences. This unusual diversity of applications is due to their superior hydrophilicity and conductivity, high carrier concentration, ultra-high volumetric capacitance, rich surface chemistry, and large specific surface area. However, it is difficult to make MXenes with the desired surface functional groups that deliver high reactivity and high stability, because most MXenes are extracted from ceramics (MAX phase) by an etching process, where a large number of metal atoms are inevitably exposed on the surface, with other anions and cations embedded uncontrollably. The exposed metal atoms and implanted ions are thermodynamically unstable and readily react with trace oxygen or oxygen-containing groups to form the corresponding metal oxides or degrade chemically, resulting in a sharp decline in activity and loss of excellent physicochemical properties. The addition of certain synergistic additives during the intercalation and chemical modification of surface functional groups under non-hazardous conditions can result in stable and efficient MXene-based materials with exceptional optical, electrical, and magnetic properties. This review discusses several such methods, mainly additive-mediated intercalation and chemical modification of the surface functional groups of MXene-based materials, followed by their potential applications. Finally, perspectives are given to discuss the future challenges and promising opportunities of this exciting field.

1. Introduction
MXenes are a booming family of 2D nanomaterials that have drawn unusually broad and interdisciplinary attention recently.1–8 In the general formula of MXenes – Mn+1XnTx, M, X, T, and x stand for early transition metal (Ti, Sc, Zr, Hf, etc.), carbon and nitrogen, surface termination groups such as halogen functional groups (i.e., –F, –Br), chalcogen functional groups (i.e., –OH, –O–, and –S), imino (–NH) and vacancy functional groups, and the number of surface termination groups, respectively. MXenes are obtained mainly by etching the “A” layers in the MAX phases using F-containing agents in a so-called Lewis acid etching approach. Here, A stands for an element from the main groups III–VI (i.e., Al, Si, P, and S) and late transition metals (e.g., Zn, Fe, Ni, and Cu). Few-layer and monolayer MXenes can be fabricated by further interacting multi-layer MXenes with alkali metal cations and other intercalants (I), where I represents an element from alkali metal cation intercalants (i.e., Li, Mg, and Al),9–17 as illustrated in Fig. 1a. Interestingly, it is found that the Al element is used both as the “A” layer and the intercalant ion “I”, the S element as both the “A” layer and surface terminations “Tx”, and the N element as the “X” layer, surface terminations “Tx” and intercalant ion “I”. So far, MXene compositions with “n” ranging from 1 to 4 have been reported. In MXene structures, n + 1 layers of M cover n layers of X in an [MX]nM arrangement, such as M2X, M3X2, M4X3, and M5X4. The first MXene Ti3C2Tx was reported by Naguib et al. in 2011.10 A new MXene with five atomic layers of transition metals (Mo4VC4Tx) has been recently successfully synthesized.11 To date, more than 26 carbide-based MXenes (i.e., Ti2CTx, Zr3C2Tx, (Cr2V)C2Tx, and (Mo2Nb2)C3Tx), four nitride-based MXenes (Mo2NTx, Ti2NTx, Ti4N3Tx and (Ti, V)2NTx), and only one carbonitride-based MXene (Ti3CNTx) have been experimentally synthesized. About 80 MXenes have been theoretically investigated and predicted, as shown in Fig. 1b.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic diagram of the periodic table of elements closely related to the reported MXenes. (b) MXenes theoretically predicted and experimentally synthesized with four different formulas: M2X, M3X2, M4X3 and M5X4, reported to date. Here, M, A, and X originate from the MAX phase, and Tx and I represent the surface termination groups and intercalants during the MAX-to-MXenes synthesis process (etching, intercalation or functionalization steps). 
Owing to the appealing properties, including highly adjustable metal composition and surface functional groups, good hydrophilicity, high strength, substantial specific surface area, excellent conductivity, and tunable band and nanostructures, MXenes show great promise for use in batteries, supercapacitors, catalysis, optoelectronic devices, water purification, biomedicine, gas sensors, and other emerging fields.18–23 Besides, because of their atom-layer thickness and ultra-flat nature, they promise to extend Moore's Law through the miniaturization of future electronic devices. However, the controllability of MXene-based materials synthesized by conventional F-containing aqueous etching and intercalation processes is limited in terms of layer number, morphology, metal composition, and surface termination groups. During the process of etching, intercalation, surface group modification, as well as storage and device construction of MXene-based materials, the unavoidable embedment of impurities such as ions, oxidation, and chemical degradation due to dissolved oxygen and water inevitably occur, resulting in a sharp decline in activity of MXenes and a loss of optical/electrical/magnetic/thermal and physicochemical performance of the fabricated devices.24–27
Theoretical studies have demonstrated that certain synergistic additives can tune the kinetics and thermodynamics during the intercalation and chemical modification of MXene-based materials and modulate the electronic properties and surface functional groups, thereby leading to exceptional-quality and high-reactivity MXenes with fascinating performances.28–33 Experimental results have simultaneously confirmed that the introduction of synergistic additives can help produce high-quality MXene-based materials and devices through controllable synthesis, enhancing their anti-oxidation ability and storage stability, and improving the performance of the corresponding applications.34–39 Mohammadi et al. demonstrated that introducing alkali cations into delaminated V2CTx MXene dispersions could fabricate an ordered and flexible multi-layer restacked V2CTx film, which exhibits high specific capacitances (∼1315 F cm−3) and a capacitance retention of ≈77% after one million cycles.40 Zhang et al. demonstrated that the addition of a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel is conducive to the fabrication of MXene (Ti3C2Tx)-based composite hydrogels with a high stretchability of more than 3400% and remarkable adhesiveness to various surfaces.41 Zhao et al. proposed using sodium L-ascorbate as a capping ligand and an antioxidant to enhance the stability of MXenes, and the protected Ti3C2Tx-MXenes colloid can be stably stored for 21 days at room temperature.26
In this review, we summarize recent advances in the synergistic additive-mediated intercalation (i.e., molecule-, cation-, organic base-mediated)23,40,42–51 and chemical modification (i.e., F-containing compound-, inorganic base-, Lewis acidic molten salt-aided)10–14,22,52–54 of high-reaction-activity MXene-based materials, and the corresponding performance improvement for energy and environmental, biological, electronic and optical applications.5,12,13,43–46,55–71 The fundamental mechanisms of synergic additives during the intercalation and chemical modification of MXene-based materials will be discussed. For example, the introduction of alkali cations can tune c-lattice parameters (c-LP); the addition of antioxidants or poly-anions can form ion shielding to prevent oxidation; the intervention of small molecules (i.e., urea, hydrazine) can delaminate multi-layers into single or few-layers; the mediation of molten inorganic salts can accurately control surface groups, resulting in high-quality MXene-based materials with significantly improved optical/electrical/magnetic/thermal and physicochemical performances. Finally, perspectives will be given on the challenges in this exciting research field.
2. Synthesis of additive-mediated MXene-based materials
Recently, there has been an avalanche of research focused on the fabrication of highly-active MXene-based materials.11–13,16–23 However, due to the exposure of numerous metal atoms on the surface and uncontrolled embedding of ions during regular etching, and the intercalation and modification process, MXene-based materials are easily oxidized, leading to chemical degradation and loss of functions in a matter of days.24–27 Hence, how to controllably prepare stable MXene-based materials with high activity is crucial. Recently, it has been observed that the addition of appropriate synergistic additives in intercalation and chemical modification systems can produce high-quality and stable MXene-based materials with excellent performance under relatively mild experimental conditions.10–14,22,23,42–54 Here, we focus on several typical synergistic additive-mediated intercalations (i.e., molecule-, cation-, organic base-mediated) and chemical modifications of surface termination groups (i.e., halogen, chalcogen, imino and vacancy functional groups), and then summarize their respective functions and microscopic mechanisms during the intercalation and chemical modification.
2.1 Additive-mediated intercalation
Like graphene, few-layer or monolayer MXenes can show unique chemical and physical properties and remarkable performances, which are obviously different from those of multi-layer MXenes.2–9 To obtain few-layer or monolayer MXenes, intercalation and delamination are requisite steps. In the few-layer or monolayer MXene fabrication process with the MAX phase as the precursor, the etching and intercalation/delamination can be carried out in sequential steps or simultaneously. So far, intercalants, which can insert between the layers of MXenes to break or weaken the interlayer van der Waals bonds and result in increasing c-LP, can be mainly divided into three categories: molecule, cation, and organic base (Fig. 2).40,42–51
 Fig. 2  Schematic of the synergistic additive-mediated intercalation approaches in MXenes. The intercalating agents include molecules (e.g., DMSO), cations (e.g., NH4+, Li+, Mg2+, Al3+, alkylammonium cations, aryl diazonium cations), and organic bases (e.g., i-PrA, TBAOH). 

2.1.1 Molecule-mediated intercalation. 
Molecule-mediated intercalants, such as H2O and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), can increase the c-LP of surface-functionalized Ti3C2Tx. For the MXenes prepared by aqueous etching, H2O molecules are usually intercalated between the MXene sheets. As reported by Wang et al.,72 the c-LP of as-prepared MXenes significantly increased to 23.4 Å (compared to that of the MAX phase, Ti3AlC2 (18.6 Å)) due to the intercalated H2O molecules. Furthermore, this value was increased to 27.6 Å when using DMSO as the intercalant.72 Besides, polymer molecules, such as PVA, can be used as intercalants to control the MXene thicknesses via a simple vacuum filtration process.45 The MXene layer spacing increases with the amount of PVA, with monolayer Ti3C2Tx found in the case of high PVA content. After 10 wt% PVA intercalation, the 0002 peak of the MXenes in the as-obtained Ti3C2Tx/PVA films decreased from ∼6.4° to ∼5°, corresponding to a c-LP increase from 27.6 Å to 35.3 Å.


2.1.2 Cation-mediated intercalation. 
In addition to molecule-mediated intercalation, cation-mediated intercalation is also a common strategy for fabricating few-layer or monolayer MXenes. Various cations, including NH4+, H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Al3+, can be intercalated spontaneously between Ti3C2Tx MXene layers in aqueous solutions.40,46–48,56,59 It was found that the intercalation depends on pH and the cations' nature. In the case of high-pH NH4+ and K+ solutions, the c-LP of Ti3C2Tx can both increase by ∼5.1 Å in comparison to the pristine MXenes.46 To further expand the layer spacing of MXene layers, Wang et al.47 and Ghidiu et al.48 employed larger polyatomic cations, such as aryl diazonium salts (+N2-phenyl-SO3H) and alkylammonium cations ([(CH3)3NR]+, where R represents CH3, C6H13, C10H21, C12H25, C16H33) cations, as the intercalant, which replaced the intercalated Li+/Na+ ions by an ion-exchange method. The layer-spacing of Ti3C2Tx MXenes has been tuned accurately in the range of 5–28 Å via altering the alkyl chain length of alkylammonium cations, and the intercalated MXene Ti3C2Tx multi-layers are easier to delaminate.48 It can be seen that the addition of aryl diazonium and alkylammonium cations could significantly widen the intercalation chemistry of MXene-based materials. The latest reports demonstrate that cation-mediated intercalation can increase the c-LP, facilitate subsequent delamination to form thin-layer or monolayer MXenes, and drive chemically unstable delaminated monolayer MXene (V2CTx) sheets to self-assemble into highly-stable multi-layered films due to electrostatic attractions.40


2.1.3 Organic base-mediated intercalation. 
The molecule- and cation-mediated intercalation is not universal for all MXenes. For example, Naguib et al. reported that Ti3C2Tx could be intercalated and delaminated with DMSO, but Ti3CNTx could not.49 Interestingly, organic bases as the intercalants, such as hydrazine monohydrate N2H4·H2O,42 are more versatile for intercalating MXenes. Mashtalir et al. have developed organic base isopropylamine (i-PrA) as an intercalant to intercalate and delaminate Nb2CTx, Ti3C2Tx, and Nb4C3Tx.50 In aqueous solution, i-PrA forms ammonium cations (R-NH3+) which can intercalate in-between Nb2CTx layers driven by electrostatic forces. Moreover, due to the unique molecular structure of i-PrA, the steric hindrance can be overcome upon intercalation, with enough power to push the MXene layers apart. Additionally, the c-LP of Nb2CTx increases from 20.8 Å to 45.4 Å after i-PrA-mediated intercalation. Similar to i-PrA, other organic bases, including n-butyl amine (n-BA), choline hydroxide (ChOH), and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH), can induce spontaneous swelling, which in turn lowered the bond energy in-between MXene layers, thereby resulting in the intercalation and delamination of multi-layer MXene Ti3CNTx and V2CTx powders under mild sonication.49,51 After TBAOH treatment, the c-LP of V2CTx and Ti3CNTx increased from 19.9 Å to 38.72 Å, and 21.4 Å to 39.24 Å, respectively, showing the universality of organic base-mediated intercalation for MXenes.49
In summary, due to the unique layered structural characteristics of MXenes, the interlayer spacing of MXenes can provide enough space for the intercalants to be embedded. As shown in Table 1, we summarize the influences of different additive intercalations on their c-LP values and corresponding performances. It can be easily found that despite the intercalant type, a larger size of the intercalants would lead to a higher c-LP of the MXenes. It is worth noting that when measuring the c-LP of MXenes, it is usually measured in the form of MXene thin films by XRD. The increased c-LP value of intercalated MXenes is beneficial to the further modification of MXenes. The introduction of different intercalants as interlayer spacers can produce a more open structure to weaken the interlayer cohesive forces, and adjust the conductivity, flexibility, and capacitance of MXenes, thus resulting in a significant difference in the optical, electrical, catalytic and sensing performances.

It is worth noting that the H2O molecule is the most common intercalant for MXenes.72,73 Almost all intercalation behaviors are accompanied by the intercalation of H2O. Combined with ultrasonic treatment, the yield of small-size and thin-layer MXene flakes can significantly increase. Interestingly, the easy insertion behaviour of H2O molecules between the MXene layers makes them a good candidate for humidity sensors.74 Moreover, the DMSO-intercalated MXenes exhibit a significantly higher adsorbed amount of CO2 capture. In fact, the volume capacity of intercalated-Ti3C2Tx can be up to 502 V v−1, higher than most known sorbents.72 In addition, Mashtalir and co-workers demonstrated that DMSO and urea could both intercalate into MXene-Ti3C2Tx, but N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) only intercalated into Ti3C2Tx in the presence of N2H4·H2O.42 Moreover, the Li+ capacity of the DMSO-intercalated MXenes was significantly enhanced compared to primitive samples. For cation-intercalated MXenes, Lukatskaya and co-workers demonstrated notable intercalation capacitances, especially on the Na+-intercalated Ti3C2Tx electrode, which displayed a volumetric capacitance of up to 350 F cm−3 in basic solution, opening up exciting possibilities of developing improved intercalation electrodes for supercapacitors and batteries.46
Through an in-depth analysis of the reported literature, it is found that most of the organic base intercalants and some cation intercalants can induce swelling that in turn weakens the interlayer interactions, followed by simple sonication or agitation, thus producing large-scale delamination of the MXene thin-layers.47,49,50 Therefore, in future MXene research, it will be essential to select suitable intercalants to modulate MXenes according to the desired applications, and also seek more green, convenient, and universal intercalation techniques to intercalate and delaminate different components and proportions of MXenes (i.e. Mo4VC4Tx, Ti2NTx, Ti3CNTx). Of course, in order to obtain large-area, stable and thin-layer MXenes with excellent performance, it should not be limited to liquid-phase intercalation and delamination. Vapor–solid intercalation or vapor–liquid intercalation could be a better option.

2.2 Additive-aided chemical modification
In addition to the above-mentioned intercalations, chemical modification of surface terminal groups is another promising and effective strategy to enhance MXene activity. It is well known that MXenes have abundant and adjustable surface terminal groups (Tx = –F, –OH, and –Te), and many research groups are dedicated to enhancing the optical, electrical, magnetic, piezoelectric, and thermoelectric properties via chemical modification of these surface terminal groups. To date, the surface terminal groups of MXene-based materials can be categorized into the following groups: halogen terminal functional groups (–F, –Cl, –Br), chalcogen terminal functional groups (–OH, –O–, –S, –Se, –Te), imino (–NH), and vacancy terminal functional groups,10–13,52–54,73–93 as illustrated in Fig. 3(a–c).

2.2.1 Halogen-functionalized MXene surfaces. 
In 2011, the first discovery of MXenes was realized by etching Al layers of the MAX phase (Ti3AlC2) in HF acid, which introduced a certain amount of –F and –OH surface terminal groups on MXenes (Fig. 3a).10 After etching, exfoliation of 2D Ti3C2 layers with two exposed Ti atoms per unit formula was achieved. Subsequently, the exposed MXene surfaces were swiftly terminated by fluorine ions (Ti3C2F2) and hydroxyl groups (Ti3C2(OH)2) from an aqueous environment, according to reactions (1), (2), and (3). This work paved the way for the fabrication of numerous MXenes.10 Ti3AlC2 + 3HF = AlF3 + 3/2H2 + Ti3C(1) Ti3C2 + 2HF = Ti3C2F2 + H2(2) Ti3C2 + 2H2O = Ti3C2(OH)2 + H2(3)
Recently, Li et al. used late transition metal halide molten salts, such as ZnCl2, which have relatively low melting points and strong Lewis acidity, as an additive.53 This method was later verified to be universally effective.13 By doing so, they developed a general approach to yield Cl-terminated MXenes (Ti2CCl2, Ti3C2Cl2) in a two-step elemental replacement process on the “A” atomic plane of traditional MAX phases, as summarized in reaction (4) and (5).53 The high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) image of the obtained MXenes showed Cl atom terminations on the surface of Ti3C2Tx (Fig. 3d).53 The formation of Ti3C2Cl2 happens comparably to the HF etching process of MAX (Ti3AlC2), in which Zn2+ and Cl− play roles similar to those for H+ and F−, respectively. Ti3AlC2 + 1.5ZnCl2 = Ti3ZnC2 + 0.5Zn + AlCl3↑(4) Ti3ZnC2 + ZnCl2 = Ti3C2Cl2 +2Zn(5)


2.2.2 Chalcogen-functionalized MXene surfaces. 
In addition to halogen terminated groups, the second category of surface terminal groups is chalcogen functional groups, including –OH, –O– (epoxy), –S, –Se, and –Te (Fig. 3b). As mentioned above, the surface terminal groups of MXenes prepared by etching Al in HF solution are most probably a mixture of –F (reaction (2)) and –OH groups (reaction (3)).10
Based on the above reaction, Jiang et al. reported a stepwise and controllable functionality-modification approach to get Ti3C2(OH)2 and Ti3C2Ox MXenes.52 Firstly, Ti3C2(OH)2 was prepared by dispersing the intercalated/delaminated Ti3C2F2 nanosheets in KOH aqueous solution, where a replacement reaction between F-groups and OH-groups occurred due to the difference in bond dissociation energies for Ti–F (∼569 ± 33 kJ mol−1) and Ti–O (∼666.5 ± 5.6 kJ mol−1) bonds.12 Then, Ti3C2(OH)2 was transformed to Ti3C2Ox through a dehydration reaction under heat treatment.52 The O 1s spectrum in the XPS result indicated –OH and –O– terminal groups (Fig. 3e).54 Moreover, the density of oxygen coverage in Ti3C2Ox increases with the increase of KOH concentration.52 Meanwhile, Kamysbayev et al. recently employed substitution and elimination reactions of Ti3C2Br2 with Li2S, Li2Se, and Li2Te to fabricate –S, –Se, and –Te terminated MXenes (Ti3C2S, Ti3C2Se, and Ti3C2Te, respectively) with the introduction of molten alkali metal halides (CsBr/KBr/LiBr eutectic) (Fig. 3b).12 Several Ti–Te XPS characteristic peaks were observed, as shown in Fig. 3f, indicating successful preparation of Te-terminated MXenes.12 The as-obtained chalcogen functional group-terminated MXenes all showed distinctive structural and electronic properties.


2.2.3 Imino and vacancy-functionalized MXene surfaces. 
So far, a third kind of surface terminations can be summarized as imino (–NH) and vacancy (□ stands for the vacancy) functional groups (Fig. 3c and g). Similarly, with the mediation of molten alkali metal halides, Nb2CCl2 MXenes with labile surface bonding can react with NaNH2 and LiH to produce Nb2C(NH) and Nb2C□2 MXenes.12
Compared with M–F and M–OH bonds, the bonding energies of M–Cl and M–Br are relatively weak.12 Hence, Cl- and Br-terminated MXenes can act as versatile synthons for further exchange reactions, thus realizing the controllable chemical-transformation of different surface terminal groups (i.e., Cl, Br, O, S, Se, Te, NH and □) in MXenes with the aid of molten Lewis acidic/basic salts. All MXenes without surface terminations are supposed to be metallic due to the abundant charge carriers (i.e., free electrons in transition metals). When terminated with OH and F groups, the band structure exhibits a semiconducting character, with a clear separation between valence and conduction bands. Thus, it is possible to tune the optical, electrical, magnetic, piezoelectric, and thermoelectric performances of MXenes by varying the surface terminal groups.
Several typical examples showing the effect of surface terminal groups on the optical, electrical, magnetic, piezoelectric, and thermoelectric properties are summarized in Table 2. In terms of optics, our group demonstrated that the F desorption of Ti3C2Tx flakes could lead to a monotonic blue-shift in the surface plasmon (SP) energy.71 Interestingly, with surface passivation by –NH groups, MXene quantum dots can exhibit a strong photoluminescence (PL) property.32,77,78 Compared to pristine MXenes, –F and –OH terminated samples show weaker absorption and reflectivity (Abs and Ref) in the visible area (Vis), but –O termination results in an enhancement.79,80 In terms of electrical properties, plenty of literature reports claim that surface terminations can modulate the electronic properties of MXenes via tuning the density of states and the Fermi levels.1–5,10,12,75,76,88–93 Generally speaking, the work function (WF) of MXenes follows this trend: –O– > –F > bare > –OH functionalized MXenes. Besides, some MXenes (e.g., Nb2CSe12) have been experimentally reported to exhibit superconducting (SC) properties. Regarding magnetism, theoretical calculations showed that the surface engineering of MXenes could induce spin-valley coupling. It is found that Janus MXene Cr2COF induced ferromagnetic (FM) performance with an intense valley polarization of 334 meV and a high Curie temperature of 1146 K, but an antiferromagnetic (AFM) behavior was observed on Cr2TiC2FCl MXenes.81 Frey and co-workers reported that Mn2NO2 and Cr2NO2 showed FM behavior due to the interplay of sufficiently strong spin–orbit coupling and bond anisotropy.82 Surprisingly, they also found that Janus Mn2N for all models of mixed termination showed a FM feature and Janus Ti2C, Cr2C displayed AFM behavior.32,83 In terms of piezoelectric properties, –O and –S terminated MXenes (i.e., Sc2CO2, La2CO2, Sc2CS2, Y2CS2,) possess a significant piezoelectric response (PE), as predicted by density functional theory calculations.32,84,85 Regarding thermoelectricity, fluorine-terminated M2XTx (Mo2CF2) displayed a superior thermoelectric power factor (TE) via theoretical prediction.86 Moreover, our group demonstrated experimentally that Mo-based MXenes Mo2CTx, Mo2TiC2Tx, and Mo2Ti2C3Tx possessed strong thermoelectric properties after thermal elimination of surface terminal groups (–OH, –O–). Notably, the thermoelectric power reaches 3.09 × 10−4 W m−1 K−2 at 803 K for the Mo2TiC2Tx MXene.87 In summary, slight modifications of the surface terminal groups can significantly change the optical, electrical, magnetic, piezoelectric, and thermoelectric properties of MXenes.

3. Theoretical simulations
To obtain insights into the role of additives in intercalation and chemical modification, theoretical simulations have been performed to investigate the possible intercalation process and the chemical transformation of the surface terminal groups on MXene-based materials via thermodynamics and kinetics.12,26,29,33,43,55,56 Taking urea-mediated intercalation of Ti3C2Tx as an example, Meng et al. discussed the adsorption behavior of a urea molecule on the Ti3C2Tx surface and in-between layers with different surface terminations using first-principles calculations.43 The stable adsorption configurations and binding energies between two layers of MXenes before and after intercalation of urea, as well as the charge density of urea on –OH, –F, and, –O-terminated Ti3C2Tx surfaces, are shown in Fig. 4a. It was found that urea molecules tended to adsorb parallel to the Ti3C2Tx surface, suggesting the ability of urea to intercalate in-between stacked MXenes layers. Among the –OH, –F, and –O-terminated Ti3C2Tx, urea's most stable adsorption state was on the Ti3C2(OH)x surfaces, which is attributed to the greater amount of charge transfer between the urea molecule and the OH-terminated surface (Fig. 4a). This result indicates that the adsorption of urea by Ti3C2Tx affects the interlayer spacing of MXenes and is thermodynamically favorable. To probe the effect of surface terminal groups on the MXene structure, a unit cell of Ti2CTe MXenes was employed, as illustrated in the left column of Fig. 4b, where the in-plane lattice constant a is defined as the distance of Ti–Ti2.12 An elastic model was assumed in which the Ti3C2 layers could be approximated as an elastic isotropic solid sheet under tensile stress from the surface terminal groups (S, Cl, Se, Br and Te). In the elastic model, the out-of-plane strain (εzz = ε⊥), and in-plane strain (εxx = εyy = ε‖) of the Ti3C2Tx layers along the c axis can be established in correlation with the tensile stress according to the 3D Hooke's Law. The right column of Fig. 4b shows a relationship between the strain components (ε⊥ and ε‖) and the expansion of the a-lattice parameter in S-, Cl-, Se-, Br-, and Te-terminated Ti3C2Tx, which the Poisson effect could explain.12 This implies that surface terminal groups can induce giant strain in the MXene lattice.

The theoretical simulations are often used to explain the mechanisms of intercalation and transformation of surface terminal groups, and predict the electro/optical/catalytical performance of synergistic additive-mediated MXene-based materials, providing design guidance for high-performance applications.28–31,43,55,56 As shown in Fig. 4c, to investigate the role of the intercalants (i.e., DMSO, acetonitrile (ACN), propylene carbonate (PC)) in influencing the interlayer spacing and electrochemical responses of Ti3C2Tx during cycling, MD simulations were carried out.55 The MD simulation result indicated that the –CH3 groups of the intercalated DMSO during charge–discharge cycles are free. Therefore, the electrostatic interactions with the distant charged electrode surface and the hydrophobic CH3 groups experienced by the Li+ ions entering the electrode have weakened, resulting in a fast Li+ transport tunnel. Moreover, the number of intercalated Li+ was calculated to be ∼0.93, 0.46 and 0.37 per Ti3C2Tx unit (Fig. 4c) for the PC-, DMSO- and ACN-mediated intercalation electrolyte systems, respectively. This work suggests that the introduced intercalants in-between the Ti3C2Tx layers significantly affect the Li+ transport and total amount of stored charge.
These theoretical simulations provide a theoretical foundation and general guidance for developing highly active MXene-based materials for high-performance applications using synergistic additives. However, it should be noted that, when conducting theoretical calculations on MXenes, actual experiments are needed to support the theoretical results as much as possible. In addition, during these theoretical calculations, more consideration should be given to practical experimental conditions. For example, regarding the electrical conductivity of MXenes, most practical experimental tests are conducted on MXene thin films, where the conductivity is more determined by the inter-sheet conductivity. However, most theoretical calculations were devoted to retrieving the conductivity on a single MXene nanosheet, which fails to explain the experimental results on MXene conductivity.
4. Applications of additive-mediated MXene-based materials
Selected synergistic additives promote the intercalation and chemical modification of MXene-based materials and their performance for the corresponding emerging applications. In this section, we focus on the energy and environmental, biological, electronic, and optical applications based on the additive-mediated MXenes.5,12,13,43–46,55,59–93
4.1 Energy and environmental
The energy and environmental applications based on additive-mediated MXene materials are mainly summarized into four aspects: energy storage, clean-energy production, seawater desalination, and crude-oil clean-up. MXenes with high electronic conductivity and ultra-high volumetric capacitance have proved to be promising electrode candidates for supercapacitors and Li+ batteries in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolyte systems.13,45,46,55,59–62Fig. 5a lists the milestone development of supercapacitor electrodes based on additive-mediated MXenes in aqueous electrolytes. In 2013, flexible Ti3C2Tx paper electrodes made of few cation-intercalated layered (i.e., Al3+, K+) Ti3C2Tx offered a high volumetric capacitance of 450 F cm−3 in 1 M KOH electrolyte.46 This outstanding electrochemical performance could be ascribed to good contact between the paper electrode's restacked sheets. In the case of PVA-mediation, the fabricated Ti3C2Tx/PVA-KOH films with a thickness of ∼3.9 μm exhibited a high capacitance of 528 F cm−3 at 2 mV s−1, which can be attributed to the confinement and intercalation of PVA in-between Ti3C2Tx sheets, resulting in improved access to deep trap sites, and enhancement in ionic conductivity.45 In 2014, Ghidiu et al. demonstrated that the capacitance values of a rolled 5 μm-Ti3C2Tx “clay” can reach 900 F cm−3 in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, which was ascribed to the small sizes of intercalated H+ ions and increased interlayer spacing due to pre-intercalated H2O molecules in the one-step etching and intercalation procedure.59

Comparison of the material performance and the corresponding schematic illustrations of (a) Ti3C2Tx paper, Ti3C2Tx/PVA film, Ti3C2Tx ‘clay’ and Ti3C2Tx hydrogel electrodes in aqueous electrolytes, and (b) Ti3C2Tx, CNT-Ti3C2Tx, Ti3C2 and MS-Ti3C2Tx electrodes in non-aqueous electrolytes, respectively.

In aqueous electrolytes, MXene-based electrodes have exhibited an attractive electrochemical performance. Still, they were only carried out in a narrow voltage window,61,62 leading to greatly restricted power and energy density. To address this issue, Dall’Agnese et al. developed a series of electrochemical capacitors based on additive-assisted MXenes in non-aqueous electrolytes, as illustrated in Fig. 5b. The rolled Ti3C2Tx clay film and the hybrid film of the Ti3C2Tx clay with carbon nanotube (CNT-Ti3C2Tx) electrodes showed capacitance of ∼75 and 245 F cm−3 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 and a large voltage window of 3 V in 1 M electrolyte of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide (EMI-TFSI) in ACN, respectively.62 The latter could be attributed to the disordered structure of the Ti3C2Tx film after filtration and vacuum drying, and the large interflake spacing due to the intercalation of EMI+ cations, as well as a fast diffusion path owing to the introduction of CNT. In 2019, Wang et al. demonstrated that the vacuum-filtered macroporous Ti3C2 thin film electrode in an electrolyte of Li-TFSI in PC can achieve a high volumetric capacitance of ∼410 F cm−3 at 2 mV s−1 with a voltage window of 2.4 V. The efficient desolvation of Li+ ions could explain this excellent performance during charging due to the intercalation of Li-TFSI/PC, which results in fast charge transport and high volumetric charge-storage capability.55 Recently, using Lewis acidic molten salt-mediation, novel MXenes (named MS-MXenes) were prepared via redox-controlled A-site (A = Al, Zn, Si, Ga) etching of unconventional MAX phases and the as-obtained MS-Ti3C2Tx achieved an extremely high discharge capacity of ∼738 C g−1 with a capacitance retention of ≈90% after 2400 cycles at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1 and a large voltage window of 2.8 V in 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte.13 The exceptional capacity of MS-MXenes may be explained by the high content of O-terminated groups and the absence of OH surface groups within a molten salt-mediated synthesis system, leading to a strong interaction between O and Li and increased Li capacity. Hence, we can conclude that additive-mediated MXene electrodes can exhibit impressive electrochemical performance in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes through appropriate design.
In addition to energy storage, additive-mediated MXenes can also be applied to clean-energy production, seawater desalination, and crude-oil clean-up with exceptional performance, as shown in Fig. 6. Mo2TiC2Tx nanosheets with anchored PtSA (Mo2TiC2Tx-PtSA) were synthesized using the H+ cation-mediated electrochemical exfoliation and atom trapping technique (Fig. 6a).56 The desired catalyst showed a shallow Tafel slope (∼30 mV dec−1) and overpotential (∼30 mV, 10 mA cm−2), superior to commercial Pt/C and most previously reported HER catalysts, as shown in Fig. 6b. This exceptional HER activity was derived from the frail H adsorption strength  on the surface of Mo2TiC2Tx-PtSA.

In 2020, non-swelling MXene membranes (MXMs) were fabricated through filtration and an Al3+ ion-intercalating approach (Fig. 6c), and they exhibited an exceptionally high rejection rate of NaCl (∼89.5–99.6%) with fast water fluxes (∼1.1–8.5 L m−2 h−1).63 Meanwhile, the time-dependent Na+ permeation (Fig. 6d) and MD simulation snapshots (inset of Fig. 6d) for two sets of Na+ permeation systems indicated excellent long-term stability (>400 h) and a much lower ion permeation rate of the proposed Al3+-intercalated MXMs. This outstanding seawater desalination performance can be ascribed to the formation of the ionic Al–O bonds between Al3+ and O-terminated groups on the MXenes nanosheets.
In addition, additive mediation can enable the application of MXenes in efficient oil/water separation. Bare MXene aerogels exhibit low mechanical strength, and their fragile properties lead to low recyclability during oil/water separation operation. To conquer this, Cai et al. applied cellulose nanocrystals as an additive to modulate the mechanical properties of MXene aerogels (Fig. 6e).64 The as-obtained MXene ternary aerogel showed highly-efficient crude oil (viscosity: ∼130000 mPa s) absorption, and also delivered a high recyclability of 76% after five cycles under sun irradiation. The absorption capacity for all tested organic liquids and oils reached up to 45 g g−1, as shown in Fig. 6f. The remarkable solar-heated oil absorbency performance can be mainly attributed to the high solar absorption efficiency of MXenes and the fast capillarity-driven oil absorption capability of the unique wood-like porous channel structures within the ternary MXene aerogels. However, the basis of these good performances is the high mechanical strength brought by the cellulose nanocrystal-mediation in the MXene aerogel.
4.2 Biological
MXenes with hydrophilic surface terminal groups have recently been demonstrated to be biocompatible, suggesting the huge application potential of MXene-based materials in biological applications, especially ultrasensitive diagnosis and disease treatment.5,43,44,65–67 Here, we mainly focus on the emerging biological applications of additive-mediated MXenes, including photothermal therapy, wearable sensors and photocatalytic sterilization (Fig. 7). A novel type of biodegradable Nb2CTx ultra-thin sheets were fabricated through HF etching and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) intercalation, after which they were chemically modified by polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (PVP) to produce Nb2CTx-PVP colloids.65 As shown in Fig. 7(a and b), in vivo photothermal therapeutic experiments showed that Nb2CTx-PVP proved to be extraordinarily effective in photothermal ablation and eradication of tumors in the first and second near-infrared light (NIR-I and NIR-II) biowindows, which could be due to the strong NIR-absorbance and high photothermal conversion efficiency of Nb2CTx-PVP.

(c) Schematic showing the adsorption of urea using Ti3C2Tx as the adsorbent in dialysate, and (d) changes in urea concentration in dialysate upon adsorption by Ti3C2Tx at different mass loadings. (e) Schematic illustration of the inactivation and reactivation mechanism under UV-irradiation and UV-photocatalysis, and (f) the performance of photo reactivation and dark repair under different conditions.

In view of the thermodynamically favorable adsorption of urea by MXenes, Meng et al. designed a wearable artificial kidney based on Ti3C2Tx (Fig. 7c), which exhibited a remarkable selective adsorption performance for urea from dialysate with a removal efficiency of ∼94% at 37 °C, as well as good hemocompatibility.43 The adsorbed amount of urea increased with the Ti3C2Tx mass loadings until it reached adsorption equilibrium (Fig. 7d), where the maximum adsorption capacity is about 21.7 mg g−1. This kind of wearable sensor has recently been extensively applied to the regeneration of dialysate by removing uremic toxins.44 The outstanding performance of this kind of wearable sensor was mainly due to the unique spatial orientation of urea molecules adsorbed in-between Ti3C2Tx layers, which easily form Ti–OH⋯N bonds with the hydrophilic terminal groups of MXenes, and van der Waals interactions.
Due to the metallic conductivity of MXenes, which is beneficial to photo-induced electron–hole separation, TiO2/MXene heterojunctions were prepared using a hydrothermal method with DMSO-mediated intercalated MXenes as the precursor and was successfully applied in photocatalytic sterilization (i.e., Escherichia coli), as shown in Fig. 7(e and f).66 A photoreactivation and dark repair of Escherichia coli were observed under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation; however, no reactivation was found after UV photocatalytic inactivation, and even a continuous decline was observed under visible light (Fig. 7f). This superior inactivation of TiO2/MXene heterojunctions can be explained as follows: the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by photocatalysis irreparably damaged the bacteria's cell structure, while the photon from UV irradiation only wrecked their DNA. Additionally, Wu et al. recently reported a fast and broad-spectrum antibacterial technique via photothermal ablation with Ti3C2Tx MXenes and NIR light.67
4.3 Electronic and optical
MXene-based materials exhibited an impressive performance in some emerging electronic and optical applications, such as electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, superconductivity, and surface plasmon, owing to their unique properties of metallic conductivity and highly adjustable surface functional groups.12,68–71,92 Several free-standing MXene films, including Ti3C2Tx, Mo2TiC2Tx, Mo2Ti2C3Tx and the corresponding MXene-sodium alginate (SA) composite films with a thickness of 1–45 μm all demonstrated remarkable EMI shielding performance in a study in 2016.68 This exceptional performance mainly originates from the highly conducting surface, where the existential abundant charge carriers can reflect EM waves, and the rich terminal functional groups, where the induced local dipoles can absorb incident EM waves, and the unique layered structure of free-standing MXene films, where transmitted waves with less energy present multiple internal reflections, eventually causing the EM wave to be almost completely attenuated, as shown in Fig. 8a. A versatile technique for large-scale production of MXene-based EMI-shielding film by drop-casting onto commercially available hydrophobic plastic substrates was reported in 2020.69 Compared to flat films, the as-obtained scalable and micropatternable Ti3C2Tx free-standing films can boost a 38% increase in normalized EMI shielding efficiency. Interestingly, in comparison to Ti3C2Tx free-standing films and metal- or carbon-based materials previously reported with a similar thickness, relatively less conductive Ti3CNTx MXenes prepared by thermal annealing displayed a significantly higher EMI shielding performance (Fig. 8b),70 which might be attributed to the anomalously high absorption of EM waves in-between layers, in the metamaterial-like structure of Ti3CNTx.

Superconductivity is a fascinating and highly significant physical phenomenon for the future development of science and technology. Kamysbayev et al. recently demonstrated that Nb2CTx MXenes fabricated through substitution and elimination reactions in molten Lewis acidic salts were a promising candidate for superconductivity application.12 The successful preparation of Nb2CS2 MXenes was confirmed by the atomic resolution low angle annular dark field image (Fig. 8c). It was found that Nb2CS2 and Nb2CSe both showed a transition to the superconducting state, while Nb2COx and Nb2C□2 did not (Fig. 8d). Interestingly, although the pristine Nb2C(NH) MXene pellet exhibited an insulating behavior possibly due to the poor electronic coupling between MXene sheets, a vacuum thermal treatment could endow the Nb2C(NH) pellet with obvious superconductive transition (400 °C heating refers to a superconductive transition temperature of 5.5 K, and 550 °C heating refers to that of 7.1 K). All these results indicate a surface terminal group-dependent superconductivity effect among Nb2CTx MXenes.
Another significant branch of electronic and optical applications is the surface plasmon (SP).71,93 El-Demellawi et al. have for the first time demonstrated the existence of longitudinal and transversal SP modes, and inherent interband transition in single- and multi-layered Ti3C2Tx sheets by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and ultra-high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS),71 as shown in Fig. 8e. Moreover, we have observed an upsurge in SP energies and a noticeable decrease in the SP quality factors after in situ heating of the Ti3C2Tx sheets (Fig. 8f), indicating the tunability of the longitudinal and transversal SP energy by altering the surface functional groups of MXene-based materials. Furthermore, we have fabricated Mo2CTx-based plasmonic photodetectors with a broad photoresponse in the visible spectral region and a high detectivity (≈5 × 1011 Jones), and confirmed that the photoresponse is dominated by the intrinsic SP-assisted hot carriers of MXenes.93 These results indicate a significant potential for the development of MXene-based photonic and plasmonic devices.
5. Conclusions and outlook
We have surveyed promising additives for mediating intercalation and chemical modification of high-quality MXene-based materials and enhancing the performance for energy and environmental, biological, electronic, and optical applications. These are efficient approaches to synthesize high-performing MXene-based materials with improved thermal, optical, electrical and magnetic, and photo/electrocatalytic properties.
The introduction of appropriate additives can tune c-LP, lower the bond energy in-between MXene layers, control the chemical transformations of terminal functional groups, induce a giant strain in the MXenes lattice, inhibit its oxidation and degradation, expose more active sites, enhance the ionic conductivity, speed up the interface charge transport, increase the total amount of stored charge and modulate the electronic and optical properties. In this way, we can controllably synthesize large scale MXene-based materials with high quality, controllable thickness, high activity, adjustable metal composition and terminal functional groups, and huge specific surface area, facilitating their high-performance application in energy and environmental, biological, electronic and optical fields. However, this field is still in its infancy regarding the available MXene-based materials and synergistic additives. In the future, large-scale synthesis of additive-mediated MXenes needs to be developed.
Intercalants can be used to tune the conductivity of MXenes and can be burned off at elevated temperatures. On the other hand, the intercalants can adjust the Seebeck coefficient and thermoelectric power factor, enabling MXene-based ionic thermoelectrics. Additionally, intercalants can modulate the nanofluidic channel size of MXenes and enable more emerging applications such as ionic sensing, salinity gradient energy harvesting, etc. All these results indicate that the additive-mediated MXenes could have great potential in the energy harvesting field.
In addition, additive-mediated MXenes could also be promising candidates in many other fields. Based on the reported modification technologies, the attachment of more complex moieties (receptors) on MXenes can detect biological analytes. Besides, as we have demonstrated, the tuning of the surface plasmons of MXenes can be achieved via altering the surface functional groups and the microscopic morphologies (thickness, shape, and size) of the MXene sheets.
Furthermore, although tremendous progress has been achieved in additive-mediated MXenes, many basic physical and chemical properties of them have yet to be studied. The metal composition, terminal functional groups, surface impurities, the stability of exposed metal atoms, the controllability of the layer number and the nanosheet lateral sizes, and the completeness of the terminal functional group transformation are challenging issues. More advanced instruments and more detailed test methods need to be used to study these additive-mediated MXenes.
Last but not least, theoretical simulations and machine learning efforts could offer remarkable and exceptional guidance by evaluating and predicting the physical/chemical interactions between MXene-based materials and the proposed additives, as well as their performances in various applications. However, it should be noted that theoretical calculations should proceed hand-in-hand with actual experiments to study the properties of additive-mediated MXenes.
Despite this field's rapid development, there is still plenty of room for discovery and application-specific developments for additive-mediated intercalation and surface modification of MXene-based materials.
