    , Accepted 4th December 2019First published on 5th December 2019AbstractRecombination and regeneration dynamics in Fe-NHC-sensitized DSSCs revealed incomplete injection and the detrimental effect of photoinjected electron recapture by the I3-form of the redox electrolyte on performance. Importantly, the use of additives in the electrolyte allowed the best efficiency ever recorded for an iron-based DSSC to be reached.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are popular photovoltaic devices because of their low cost and transparency.1 Their principle is to harvest solar photons using a sensitizer, linked to a photoanode (coated with a n-type TiO2 semiconductor (SC)). Upon light excitation, the sensitizer promptly injects its electron into the SC. A redox mediator then regenerates the sensitizer's ground state and is in turn regenerated at the cathode thus completing the electric circuit. Ruthenium polypyridine complexes have long been considered as top sensitizers due to their ideal photophysical and redox properties,2 reaching up to 11–14% conversion efficiency.3 Despite all these impressive properties, ruthenium remains a scarce and expensive metal limiting the real-world industrial development. This has motivated the quest for alternative metals such as iron.4,5 Unfortunately, conventional Fe(II) polypyridyl complexes are characterized by an ultrafast (ca. 100 fs) deactivation of the MLCT manifold to metal-centered (MC) states.6–9 Thus, the too short lived excited state impedes injection into the SC conduction band. One of the most successful strategies employed to delay the deactivation is to increase the ligand field strength.10–16 Significant advances have been recently reported by the use of pyridyl-N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC),10,13–16 resulting in a notable improvement of 3MLCT lifetimes up to 16 ps13 for complex C1 (inset Fig. 1) combining σ-donating NHCs and π-accepting carboxylic groups to be covalently grafted to the TiO2 surface. The first photovoltaic characterization of a Fe(II)-NHC complex, reported by some of us,13,17 revealed a weak power conversion efficiency (0.13%). In consideration of the excited state lifetime of C1 (16 ps), we expect a sufficiently efficient injection into the SC, reported to occur ideally within the fs time scale.18 Thus, it was of crucial importance to identify the bottlenecks that still limit the efficiency of Fe(II) sensitized solar cells. Herein, we report the unprecedented investigation of recombination and regeneration dynamics involving C1 (inset Fig. 1) adsorbed on either n-type TiO2 or SnO2 in the presence of I−/I3 as electrolyte as well as a new electrolyte allowing ca. 1% PCE to be reached, which is the best efficiency ever reported for an iron-sensitized DSSC.

Despite the presence of a single binding COOH group, FeNHC adsorbs strongly on TiO2 leading to a well-defined MLCT absorption peak centred at 500 nm resulting in nearly quantitative light harvesting at such wavelengths (Fig. S1, ESI†). Similar harvesting efficiency is found with SnO2 photoanodes (Fig. S2, ESI†). Since, as expected, C1 is not emitting in a fluid solution nor when loaded on solid thin films, its spectroscopic energy (E0–0 = 2.26 eV) was evaluated from the onset of the MLCT band at 550 nm. The cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†), carried out on the sensitized thin films, showed a quasi-reversible Fe(II)/(III) oxidation process (E1/2 = 0.67 V vs. SCE, ΔEpeak ≈ 100 mV). Thus the first excited oxidation potential Eox* was found at −1.6 V vs. SCE ensuring an ample driving force (ca. −0.9 eV) for injection into TiO2 whose flat band potential is typically reported19 to lie at ca. −0.7 V vs. SCE in organic electrolytes containing lithium salts. A screening of the effect of TiO2 morphology was performed in order to select the optimal substrate for cell efficiency. Commercial transparent TiO2 (Greatcell Solar 18NR-T) composed of ca. 20 nm nanoparticles (Fig. S5, ESI†) was used with (BUL) and without (no BUL) a blocking underlayer produced by spin coating 0.3 M Ti(OiPr)4 on top of FTO (fluorine-tin-oxide, Fig. S6, ESI†). Similar configuration was used in the case of a semi-opaque paste (Greatcell Solar 18NR-AO) where ca. 20 nm particles tasked with dye adsorption are mixed with large light scattering particles in the 100 nm range (Fig. S7, ESI†). SnO2 electrodes were fabricated in a similar fashion, by exploiting a colloidal paste and a blocking underlayer made by spin coating SnCl2. Different electrolytes were tested as well. The base formulation consisted of 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, 0.6 M PMII (1-methyl-3-propyl-imidazolium iodide) and 0.05 M (el1) or 0.1 M MgI2 to which different additives including GuNCS (guanidinium thiocyanate) (el2) (Table S1, ESI†) and 4-tBuPy (el3) were added. A commercial high stability electrolyte (dyesol HSE) was tested as well.
Current density vs. voltage (J–V) curves in Fig. 1 show a substantial improvement in photovoltaic performance (from 0.49 to 0.75% efficiency (η)) with the use of the blocking underlayer (BUL electrodes), consistent with the increased shunt resistance which implies lower dark current flowing between −0.1 and −0.3 V. The use of el2, containing GuNCS and 0.1 M MgI2, further enhances the performance, with Jsc = 3.3 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.44 V, FF = 0.63 and η ≈ 1% (Table S1, ESI†). This improvement was due to the presence of GuNCS which slightly increases the fill factor and Voc, ostensibly helping to block recombination, while Mg2+, being a cation with a high charge density may adsorb on the TiO2 surface and induce a surface excess of I−, speeding up dye regeneration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best efficiency ever achieved in an iron sensitized DSSC. The use of opaque titania produces slightly better photocurrents, but marginally lower Voc and a similar efficiency was observed. The better photocurrent generated by the opaque paste is consistent with broader IPCE (Incident Photon to Current Conversion Efficiency) (Fig. 2) thanks to the improved light scattering properties of 18NR-AO, but the conversion maximum of around 50% was substantially identical to that observed with the transparent electrodes which were used for the spectroscopic investigation (vide infra). Thus, the kinetic information extracted from transient spectroscopy can be safely extended to the case of opaque substrates.
 Fig. 2  IPCE spectra of TiO2 based C1 sensitized solar cells collected under short circuit in the presence of I−/I3− based electrolytes. APCE spectra with BUL/el1 (black) and No BUL/el1 (red) are shown as the inset. 
Under comparable conditions (BUL-el1), a transparent N719 sensitized reference cell produced a broader and higher IPCE spectrum (max. IPCE ≈ 80%), Jsc ≈ 13 mA cm−2 and η = 3.1% (Fig. S8 and Table S1, ESI†). The relatively small efficiency of the N719 cell is due to the lack of basic additives which enhance Voc and FF.
This choice was motivated by the need of comparing C1 and N719 under identical electrolyte conditions. It was indeed reported by Housecroft et al.20 that the presence of basic additives greatly depresses the photocurrent in Fe(II) sensitized solar cells. We indeed confirmed the same trend here (Fig. S9, ESI†). J–Vs and IPCE with el1 were also collected with SnO2 based DSSCs where, despite the ca. 300 meV larger driving force for charge injection, we obtained a limiting photocurrent value ca. half that observed with BUL-el1, corresponding to an IPCE of ca. 25% and APCE (Absorbed Photon to Current Conversion Efficiency) ≈ 30% (Fig. S10, ESI†). This suggested no thermodynamic limitation for charge injection into TiO2 with respect to SnO2 and the existence of fast recombination channels from SnO2,21 where the blocking underlayer had basically no effect on the resulting J–V characteristics (Fig. S11, ESI†).‡
Considering the best IPCE recorded with BUL electrodes, we found a constant APCE = Φinj × ηcoll in the 55/60% range in agreement with the close to unity harvesting efficiency in the region corresponding to the maximum of the MLCT band. If the collection efficiency (ηcoll) is unitary, this would set Φinj at a level of 50/60%. Under short circuit conditions, with BUL, considering the slow bielectronic reduction of I3− and the small monochromatic irradiance typical of quantum yield measurements, it is likely that ηcoll will tend to unity, if the dye is regenerated efficiently by the redox couple.
To probe the regeneration and recombination dynamics, we performed transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) in the ns/ms time scale. TAS spectra at early delays after the laser pulse are shown in Fig. 3. The photogeneration of the oxidized form of C1 is practically instantaneous for our instrumental response (FWHM 7 ns); however, a careful look at the TAS spectra at early delays evidences a spectral evolution that is substantially convolved with the laser pulse, resulting in the narrowing and in the minor blue shift of the MLCT bleaching associated with the disappearance of a weak absorption band rising for λ > 650 nm. Such dynamics is mostly evident by plotting the spectra during the first 4 ns after the laser pulse maximum (Fig. S12, ESI†), during which the FWHM of the bleaching band narrows from 91 to 73 nm while a blue shift of a few nm in the bleach minimum occurs. This spectral evolution could be assigned to the relaxation of a residual population of the lowest triplet state (T1). T1 could decay to the ground state either via non radiative pathways or by electron injection into TiO2. The lower than unity Φinj extracted from APCE probably corroborates the first hypothesis. Nevertheless, after ca. 40 ns such dynamics is complete, and no further change in the spectral shape is observed. This sets a lower limit for the injection rate constant of ca. 108 s−1. The Fe(III) form of C1 created upon laser excitation is thus characterized by the bleached MLCT band that mirrors the ground state absorption band and by a weak and featureless absorption extending to the red, probably originated by the absorption of LMCT states and of electrons photoinjected into TiO2. In the absence of electron donor, the recovery of Fe(III) is power dependent and multiexponential (Fig. S13, ESI†), stretching the time interval from a few μs to 0.1 s, owing to a distribution of electronic states in the semiconductor from which recombination occurs with different rates. At a low laser energy (300 μJ per cm2 per pulse), the decay could be fitted with two components having approximately equal amplitudes, with time constants on the order of 2 × 10−3 s and 2 × 10−2 s, respectively. At higher excitation fluences, a third component with a time constant in the scale of 10−4 s has to be added to account for the faster recombination as the number of electron/hole (Fe(III)) pairs in each TiO2 nanoparticle increases. Nevertheless, even in the presence of the stronger excitation used in this work (ca. 18 mJ per cm2 per pulse), the decay of the charge separated state is less than 80% complete on a time scale of 0.1 s. By contrast, when iodide is present in overall 0.8 M concentration, 75% of Fe(III) is regenerated on a time scale of 10 μs. A residual amplitude (ca. 4 mΔOD) of the 500 nm bleaching however does not recover on this and on longer time scales. The TAS spectra in the presence of el2 (omitting I2) in the μs–ms range are shown in Fig. 4.

 Fig. 4  TAS (10 kOhm input impedance) of C1 loaded on TiO2 in contact with el2 deprived of I2. The inset shows the evolution of the transient spectrum during the first 300 μs from excitation (0 μs (black), 20 μs (red), 60 μs (blue), 180 μs (green), 300 μs (purple)). 
The amplification of residual small ΔOD for t > 10 μs evidenced in Fig. 3 requires the application of 10 kOhm input impedance which increases the signal gain of our spectrometer by a factor of 200. The dynamics in the first 300 μs is thus substantially convolved with the laser pulse. Within this time window, we observe the fast recovery of the bleaching, accompanied by a red shift of ca. 40 nm. In the blue region, an absorption band rises, with a local maximum around 490 nm followed by a steep increase for λ < 450 nm. In the red, starting from 600 nm a flat absorption originated by photoinjected electrons increases (herein, we have to assume that no LMCT states of Fe(III) are contributing, consistent with fast regeneration of Fe(II) observed at earlier delays). In the hundreds of μs to s range, such spectral features are then maintained with a slight reduction in their respective amplitudes due to charge recombination.
We explain the initially fast bleach recovery as due to Fe(III) reduction by iodide, which results in the formation of triiodide, responsible for the absorption in the blue, particularly for the steep band rising for λ < 420 nm.22 Upon dye reduction, the electrons are free to accumulate in the conduction band, where in the absence of oxidized form of the mediator (except the one which is locally photogenerated) they persist for several ms (Fig. S21, ESI†). The persistence and the shift of the bleach is not compatible with the fast electron donation as shown in Fig. 3, and is thus assigned to the Stark effect,22 resulting from electron accumulation in the mesoscopic semiconductor. The observed spectral changes are indeed consistent with spectro-electrochemical measurements (Fig. S18, ESI†) showing, upon negative polarization of the photoanode in the dark, a blue shift of the ground state absorption, which translates, in the difference spectra, into a relatively narrow bleach peaking around 530 nm accompanied by an absorption band peaking around 480 nm. This absorption feature agrees with the absorption band observed in Fig. 4 within the same wavelength range. TAS in the presence of the complete el2 (Fig. S15, ESI†) was partly disturbed by the strong absorption in the blue arising from the presence of I3−. It was nevertheless possible to confirm the presence of the Stark bleach, followed by the absorption of photoinjected electrons extending from 600 nm to 800 nm and beyond. The analysis of the recovery kinetics in such an interval, compared to the previous case, where no I3− was initially present, allows information to be gained about the dynamics of electron recapture by the oxidized mediator. In the absence of I3−, the 750 nm absorption (Fig. S21, ESI†) is practically constant on a time scale of 20 ms, with only 6% of the initial ΔA amplitude recovering on such time scale. The small variation of the signal prevents the possibility of a reliable fitting. In contrast when 0.1 M I2 was added to the electrolyte, a decay with a time constant of 5.6 ms was observed (Fig. S22, ESI†), setting the apparent electron recapture rate constant by the redox couple in the order of 2 × 102 s−1. For comparison, the N719 electrode in the presence of the same el2 electrolyte showed a time constant of ca. 18 ms (Fig. S23, ESI†), indicating a substantially slower electron recapture by the oxidized redox relay. This difference could be due to the different surface potential imparted to TiO2 by the adsorption of a positively charged dye in the case of C1 (where the dissociation of one of the two carboxylic groups may eventually reduce the complex charge from +2 to +1) (Fig. S24–S27, ESI†) and of a negative dye in the case of N719. The cations present at the surface may eventually attract a local excess of iodide, instrumental to efficient regeneration, but also a surface excess of I3− which contributes to redox mediated recombination. The non-optimal shielding of the photoanode against recombination mediated by I3− may explain the strong effect of BUL in boosting the cell performance in the case of C1. The comparison with transient data obtained with N719 also shows that at equivalent laser power the lifetime of Ru(III) (0.5 ms) (Fig. S16, ESI†) is considerably shorter than in the case of Fe(III) (14 ms). Nevertheless, this is not influencing the solar cell performance, since in both cases regeneration occurs in the μs time scale, leading to unit regeneration efficiency.
To conclude, this study has shown that despite the ps lifetime, C1 gives rise to photoinduced injection into TiO2 producing a long lived charge separated state (e−(TiO2)/Fe(III)) surviving several milliseconds in an electrochemically inert electrolyte. Similar dynamics was found in the case of SnO2, where, however, recombination was faster and performances were generally lower than with TiO2. Fe(III) could intercept iodide with unitary efficiency, a feature which leads, when the photoanode is properly passivated, to the estimation, from APCE, of a quantum injection efficiency close to 50%.
This study points out some crucial factors affecting the performance of C1-sensitized DSSCs: (i) the nature of the electrolyte and its additives GuNCS and MgI2 leading to the best performance obtained so far. (ii) The recombination of photoinjected electrons with I3− due to positive surface potential established upon dye adsorption and the non-optimal screening of the TiO2 surface from the access of I3−. (iii) Incomplete injection, resulting from kinetic competition of charge transfer with excited state deactivation. In consideration of the excited state energetics, this may result from non-optimal electronic coupling, arising from the symmetric design of C1. Work is in progress to chemically design new FeNHC sensitizers matching these requirements to open up new avenues for efficient iron-based solar devices.
