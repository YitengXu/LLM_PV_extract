While earlier studies involving the modification of monovalent cation sites and small molecule adsorption on perovskite surface showed thermal stability improvement, further investigation is still needed to improve their overall optical functionality. In this context, the formation of a heterostructure between two different materials is an effective route for promoting stability and modulating optical energy gap. Here, Ag4Se2–XPbI3 (X = MA, FA and Cs) stackings have been proposed, constructed and theoretically studied using the Grimme correction scheme, with negative interfacial binding energy varying between −0.109 and −0.410 eV Å−2. Important stability aspects, such as thermodynamical, mechanical and thermal, were determined and confirmed, attributing to the enhanced covalency introduced by additional Ag-d and Se-p orbitals, hitherto unrevealed in constituent phases. Apart from exhibiting superior ductility and improved carrier mobility up to 103 cm2 V−1 s−1, their HSE06 level computed bandgaps of 1.29, 1.79 and 0.70 eV are lower than those measured for constituent phases, resulting in power conversion efficiency exceeding 27.5% at an attainable thickness of 0.5 μm, high static refractive index n(0) exceeding 1.8 and steeper optical absorption, where α(ω) = ∼105 cm−1 is found spanning the infrared-visible region. Findings obtained show that Ag4Se2 deposition can complement existing material design strategies for advancing the stability of these fascinating yet problematic compounds.
1 Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide-based perovskites have emerged as revolutionary materials for solar cells due to their unique physical properties, such as high carrier mobility, excellent absorption coefficient and high carrier diffusion length.1,2 At the limelight of these compounds are methylammonium (MA) lead iodide (MAPbI3) and formamidinium (FA) lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite materials. MAPbI3 with a bandgap of 1.5 eV has been regularly used as a light adsorber in solar cells.3–5 On the other hand, FAPbI3 with a comparatively more redshifted bandgap6 and stability due to the larger ionic radius of FA+ ion has been earmarked as a promising material for solar cells, while cubic phase CsPbI3, with the smallest bandgap of 1.73 eV among the inorganic lead halide perovskite family, is reported to exhibit the greatest potential in solar cell applications.7–14
However, these perovskites are susceptible to thermal stress and suffer from an unwanted phase transition, namely tetragonal → cubic and orthorhombic → cubic phases when temperature changes, affecting photovoltaic performance due to band structure variation. Reported strategies to improve their thermal stability include the growth of the heterostructure and incorporation of organic molecules into a perovskite precursor.15–18 The former improves the charge mobility and reduces the probability of charge recombination by facilitating charge separation, while the latter additive engineering can efficiently impede the movement of ions via the formation of a tightly bound system between the carbonyl group and Pb2+ ions. Addressing the phase stability issue is not only fundamentally appealing but is also necessary to create approaches for tailoring useful optoelectronic properties.
With the rapid miniaturisation of electronic devices and strong growing interest in flexible electronics, two-dimensional materials could be excellent candidates as light adsorber materials for PV solar cells. Recently, monolayer Ag4Se2 has been predicted to be highly stretchable and to have a good absorption efficiency of 11% at a thickness of 0.5 μm19 calculated based on the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) method.20 Nevertheless, for practical applications, 2D materials need to be deposited on the top of a substrate. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the absorption efficiency of monolayer Ag4Se2 deposited on a substrate. Perovskites (MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and CsPbI3) in the cubic form are considered in this study. Although these phases are metastable under ambient conditions and only gain stability at higher temperatures, the fact that the operating temperature of solar cells is often high and regularly reaches 85 °C makes this consideration reasonable.
The results suggest that Ag4Se2–MAPbI3, Ag4Se2–FAPbI3 and Ag4Se2–CsPbI3 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures possess adequate mechanical and room temperature thermal stabilities, energy gaps are smaller than their individual components, with a steadier increase of 105 cm−1 scale absorption coefficient α(ω) within the visible region, high static refractive index n(0) that can be designated as a collective effect averaging those of separate components, and decent carrier mobility, indicating their potential as optoelectronics alternatives.
2 Computational methods
First-principles calculations via the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)21,22 package were performed to determine the structural, electronic and optical properties of Ag4Se2–XPbI3 vdW heterostructures. The interaction of the core and valence electrons was described by the projected augmented wave (PAW) method. The exchange–correlation (XC) potentials were approximated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernerhof (PBE) parametrization within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). A 4 × 4 × 2 k-mesh, which comprised 56–84 atoms, in the Brillouin zone was used to sample the heterostructure. Full optimization (alternating between ion position and cell volume) of each heterostructure was achieved under the energy conversion criterion of 10−5 eV, and the Hellman–Feynman force converged to less than 0.01 eV Å−1, all using a kinetic energy cut-off of 560 eV for the plane wave expansion. A vacuum buffer space of 25 Å in the vertical direction was added to prevent the interaction between the periodic layers. The DFT-D3 method of vdW dispersion correction proposed by Grimme23 was adopted to better describe the long-range vdW interactions. For acquiring reliable ground-state energies of the materials, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) scheme24 has been applied, with a mixing parameter and a screening parameter of 0.25 and 0.20, respectively.
The frequency-dependent optical absorption coefficient α(ω) and refractive index n(ω) were calculated using real ε1(ω) and imaginary ε2(ω) components of the dielectric constant ε(ω) of the heterostructure, as shown below: (1) (2)where ε1(ω) of the spectrum was obtained by the Kramers–Kronig transformation of ε2(ω) via random phase approximation (RPA), and ω is the angular frequency. The Bader charge analysis25 was carried out to evaluate the electronic charge transfers. Carrier mobility (μ) was estimated using the Bardeen and Shockley's deformation potential theory,26 as shown below: (3)where kB, ℏ, T, m*, , C and ED are the Boltzmann constant, reduced Planck's constant, temperature at 300 K, effective mass in transport path, average effective mass, elastic modulus and deformation potential of the valence band maximum for the hole or conduction band minimum for the electron in the transport direction.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and stability
Upon optimization, MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 perovskites revealed the octahedron of the anion PBI6− trademark with lattice constants a equal to 6.30 Å, 6.36 Å and 6.29 Å, respectively, while tetragonal Ag4Se2 sheet had a = b = 5.87 Å, of which all are well consistent with previous works.27,28 The stability of the free-standing Ag4Se2 sheet has been verified via molecular dynamics (MD) and empirical calculations in our earlier study.19 To better model the introduction of an artificial vacuum, 2 × 2 × 1 supercells of both constituent structures were used to construct the Ag4Se2–XPbI3 (X = FA, MA and Cs) heterostructures. Optimized structures of all heterostructures under study are shown in Fig. 1. For each system, the supercell-induced lattice mismatches were measured from 1.1% to 7.2%, satisfying the criteria for establishing a vdW heterojunction. To verify their thermodynamic stability, binding energy Eb calculations were evaluated by subtracting the sum of energy of the Ag4Se2 monolayer and XPbI3 bulk from each heterostructure design through the following equation: (4)where A is the interface area. According to this formula, the binding stability is indicated by the magnitude of the negativity of the energy.

Stacking with large negative binding energy is considered more favorable and has a strong interaction at the ground state, hence providing theoretical support for the possible preparation in the actual experiment. Eb values for Ag4Se2–MAPbI3, Ag4Se2–FAPbI3 and Ag4Se2–CsPbI3 are negative and large, ranging between −0.109 and −0.410 eV Å−2, hence confirming the preliminary stability of these configurations. These optimized structures have interlayer distances lying between 2.49 Å and 3.06 Å, which are greater than the sum of the covalent radii between Se and I atoms, ensuring vdW as the sole interaction between the different layers. In terms of bond length, average Pb–I of 3.14, 3.15 and 3.12 Å for Ag4Se2–MAPbI3, Ag4Se2–FAPbI3 and Ag4Se2–CsPbI3, respectively, appeared shorter than Pb–I measured for the perovskite components (3.15, 3.18 and 3.14 Å), suggesting the better stability due to strengthened chemical bonding. Their thermal stability was further assessed through ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation by the Nosé–Hoover method,29 where the vdW heterostructures maintained their geometry after 5 ps without any substantial structural distortion. It is clear from Fig. 2 that the energy fluctuations of Ag4Se2–FAPbI3, Ag4Se2–MAPbI3 and Ag4Se2–CsPbI3 vdW heterostructures are small, and no sizeable geometric reconstructions were noticed, signifying the adequacy in their thermal stability at 300 K. Their mechanical behavior was further investigated to determine if these designs have adequate stiffness strength against external strains and capability to retain structural stability when subjected to in-plane strains. The calculated elastic constants Cij and moduli are listed in Table 1. These values satisfied the Born–Huang mechanical stability criteria, namely C11 − C12 > 0,C11 + C12 > 0,C66 > 0 and C11C22 > C212, hence implying sufficient mechanical stability. The integration of Ag4Se2 did not affect the ductile nature of cubic perovskites, as validated by the Poisson's ratio υ of all heterostructure designs, which exceeded 0.26.30 Their Young's modulus E values were comparable with that of phosphorene (26 and 88 N m−1 in the zigzag and armchair directions, respectively),31 but noticeably lower than 334 and 130 N m−1 for graphene and MoS2,32,33 respectively, again proving their preserved shaping deformability.

3.2 Electronic and optical properties

Fig. 3 shows the electronic band structure and projected density of states (PDOS) for each heterostructure design understudy calculated by PBE. It is clear that Ag4Se2–FAPbI3 reveals a direct bandgap (Eg) nature, in which the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are positioned at the R point, making it a potential candidate for photovoltaic and energy storage applications due to the more conducive response towards the electron–hole pair generation. Ag4Se2–MAPbI3 and Ag4Se2–CsPbI3 on the other hand displayed an indirect bandgap behavior (R → Γ and Γ–Y → Γ). Computed Eg for Ag4Se2–MAPbI3, Ag4Se2–FAPbI3 and Ag4Se2–CsPbI3 measured 1.29, 1.76 and 0.70 eV at the HSE06 level, respectively. All designs have estimated that the bandgaps were lower than those calculated for monolayer Ag4Se2 and perovskite components (see Table 2). It is noticeable that the I-5p orbital had a significant contribution to the formation of the valence band near the Fermi level (EF), which induced greater covalency through strong hybridization with additional Ag-4d and Se-4p states from −1 to −4 eV, a phenomenon not seen in standalone perovskite and Ag4Se2 structures (see ESI† S1). The conduction band is mainly constituted by the p orbitals of Ag, Se and Pb atoms. The increase in the number of orbital overlapping among these states broadens the bandwidth. This reduces the gap between valence and conduction bands and explains the smaller bandgap. Table 2 additionally includes the calculated effective masses for different directions and exciton binding energy Eexb. It can be seen that Ag4Se2–MAPbI3 and Ag4Se2–CsPbI3 heterojunctions had effective mass of holes (mh) and electrons (me) between that of their separate structures. The heterostructures had Eexb larger than their perovskite components, implying stability against the dislocation of the exciton states due to thermal effect that dominates the room temperature optical response, therefore suggesting their optional application prospects in photoluminescence.

As shown in Table 3, the Bader charge analysis reveals that 0.004, 0.012 and 0.001 electrons are transferred from MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 to the Ag4Se2 monolayer, respectively. While the value of charge transfer itself may not be solely reliable, it is crucial that there exists a flow of charge to promote the inbuilt electric field. Concurrent charge accumulation in the Ag4Se2 monolayer and depletion in perovskite induces an internal electric field, which moves from the latter to the Ag4Se2 monolayer. Moreover, their calculated work functions (4.67, 4.66 and 4.03 eV) are smaller than the corresponding values of monolayer Ag4Se2 at 5.11 eV, which indicates that electrons in these heterostructures can detach themselves from the surface more easily compared to the individual monolayer surface. To evaluate the potential application of Ag4Se2–XPbI3 heterostructures in optical devices, we calculated the absorption coefficient, real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, as shown in Fig. 4.

All heterostructure designs displayed the highest value of ε2(ω) near the visible region, a characteristic indicating good dielectric performance and photoelectric properties. An imaginary part is related to the absorption of electromagnetic fields, and the real part describes the ability of the material to store electric energy. It can be seen from the same figure that the calculated absorption spectrum α(ω) for Ag4Se2–MAPbI3, Ag4Se2–FAPbI3 and Ag4Se2–CsPbI3 within the visible region is of the order of 105 cm−1, which is somewhat higher as compared to the computed α(ω) = ∼104 cm−1 for MAPbI3, FAPbI3, c-Si and GaAs in the identical energy range.39,40 Advantages of the constituent phases are shared upon the vdW heterostructure formation, in which the optical absorption appeared to improve considerably compared to the independent monolayer Ag4Se2 and bulk perovskite, particularly in the infrared-visible region, as suggested by the steeper and steadier increment slope. Likewise, the static refractive index values n(0) > 1.8 of these specimens are larger than one of the separate components, showing a cumulative effect trend that can be understood as the average of the refractive indices for Ag4Se2 (1.59)19 and perovskites (2.37, 2.25 and 2.43).39
While direct bandgap compounds have better light utilization prospects according to the energy application viewpoint, the rise in absorptivity of the indirect bandgap Ag4Se2–MAPbI3 heterostructure was prompted by the narrower bandgap, which falls in the ideal 1.0–1.5 eV energy window for the maximum photoconversion efficiency and charge transfer induced inherent electric field. In this situation, the change in the absorptivity between direct and indirect bandgaps is not the only factor impacting the absorption performance. Notably, the high absorption extending into the UV region implies that these heterostructures could be candidates for specific operations within UV optoelectronics. Carrier mobility, μ, is another parameter playing a pivotal role in the competency of materials as candidates for solar cell devices, which in this study was calculated based on the deformation potential ED in Fig. 5.

From Table 4, compared to organometallic cubic perovskites with charge carrier mobility values far below 100 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature,41,42 these vdW heterostructures exhibited high carrier mobilities up to 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 order in both x and y paths, with higher mobility noted for electron. Next, the efficiency of each design was examined using the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency η (SLME)20 approach, which overcame the inadequacies of the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit by integrating the absorption coefficient and essentially taking dipole matrix elements and thickness into consideration. As shown in Fig. 6, apart from Ag4Se2–CsPbI3, the other two heterostructure designs exhibited notable theoretical η that surpassed 27% at a practically achievable thickness ≥ 0.5 μm, outperforming those of AsP/GaN (22%),43 WTe2/Te (22.5%) and MoTe2/Te (20.1%)44 heterojunctions.

4 Conclusion
Using density functional theory and linear response formalism, band structure and optical absorption coefficient of Ag4Se2–XPbI3 (X = FA, MA and Cs) heterostructures have been investigated. These configurations were semiconductors with the desirable hybrid functional computed bandgap (Eg) ranging between 0.70 and 1.76 eV. Findings based on the binding energies, elastic parameters analyses and MD simulation indicated that these heterostructures were energetically, mechanically and thermally stable, accompanied by the outstanding power conversion efficiency, reasonable optical absorption (α = ∼105 cm−1) spanning a wide spectrum from the infrared to ultraviolet region and high zero-frequency refractive index n(0). The improved stability at room temperature and the attractive optical characteristics suggested that monolayer Ag4Se2 topping is an effective strategy in stabilizing the cubic phase of organometallic and inorganic halide perovskites, and the resultant heterostructures could be potential candidates for future optoelectronics applications.
