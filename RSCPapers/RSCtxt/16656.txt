The BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures were fabricated by the synthesis of vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls in N2–H2 plasma using the plasma-enhanced hot filament chemical vapour deposition technique, followed by the direct synthesis of vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes on the BNCO nanowalls in a methane environment using a hot filament chemical vapour deposition method, where the B4C compound was used as the boron and carbon source. The results of field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, micro-Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry measurements indicated that the BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures were composed of vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls and vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes. The photoluminescence studies of the vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures using a Ramalog system equipped with a 325 nm He–Cd laser demonstrated the possibility to efficiently tune the photoluminescence properties of the BNCONW/GNF structures by growing the graphene nanoflakes on the vertically oriented BNCONWs. Our findings can contribute to the designing of complex hybrid graphene–semiconductor structures suitable for applications in advanced next-generation optoelectronic nanodevices.
1. Introduction
Since the discovery of graphene, enormous efforts have been made to study various two-dimensional nanomaterials due to their extraordinary physical and chemical properties, significantly exceeding those of the relevant bulk materials.1 To date, various fundamental and applied aspects of the nucleation and growth of many two-dimensional nanomaterials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and their hybrid structures have been extensively studied.2–10 The lattice constant, interlayer spacing and distance between two atoms (in the same layer) of graphite are 0.246, 0.333–0.335 and 0.142 nm, and these parameters of the h-BN structure are 0.25, 0.33–0.333 and 0.145 nm, respectively.11,12 These numbers indicate that graphene and h-BN possess significant structural and lattice similarities. Due to these significant structural and lattice similarities between graphene and h-BN, the h-BN structures can be easily grown on graphene templates.10,11 As a result, the electronic bandgap of graphene can be easily tuned using the interfaced h-BN nanowalls, and the hybrid structure formed by graphene and h-BN can ensure efficient adjustment of the mechanical, magnetic, electronic, and optical properties intrinsic to pure graphene,10,11,13–15 and in particular, the hybrid h-BN/graphene structures demonstrate unusual physical properties such as fractional quantum Hall effects.16 Due to these obvious reasons, the hybrid graphene/h-BN structures have been widely studied for the last few years.
Importantly, the appropriate doping or incorporation of heteroatoms (e.g., carbon and oxygen) can tune the bandgap and photoluminescence (PL) properties of the h-BN nanostructures in a wide range.17–19 Furthermore, oxygen in h-BN can improve the inertness of h-BN in air and water,20 thus the stability of h-BN can be improved by the oxygen incorporation into h-BN. Thus, significant attention was recently paid to studying an h-BN composition doped with carbon and incorporated with oxygen (i.e., a quaternary alloy of boron, nitrogen, carbon and oxygen BNCO structures).21–23
Despite the extensive study of BNCO composition and graphene-containing h-BN structures, the PL properties of such systems were insufficiently reported, thus restraining applications of the hybrid graphene/h-BN and graphene/BNCO structures. This work is trying to achieve unique PL properties by combining two types of important luminescent structures – BNCO nanowalls and graphene nanoflakes (i.e., BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures).
To date, the PL properties of hybrid graphene/ZnO structures have been reported, and it was demonstrated that PL is quenched due to electron transfer,24,25 while other studies report on the PL enhancement in hybrid graphene/ZnO structures due to the resonant excitation of graphene plasmon.26 In the hybrid graphene/ZnO structures, the compound ZnO material has a wide bandgap compared to graphene. Similarly, BNCO nanomaterials have a wide bandgap relative to that of the graphene;18 therefore, the question should be clarified – do the vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures possess the properties (including photoluminescence) similar to those of the hybrid graphene/ZnO system? Moreover, due to a high specific capacitance of the vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes,27,28 the vertically oriented nanoflakes will possess broadly potential applications, thus we have prepared vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures in order to study their PL properties.
In this work, the vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls were synthesized on silicon substrates covered with gold films in the N2–H2 plasma using the plasma-enhanced hot filament chemical vapour deposition (PEHFCVD) method followed by the direct growth of vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes on the vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls in a CH4 gas environment using the hot filament chemical vapour deposition (HFCVD) method, where a B4C compound was used as the boron and carbon sources during the growth of the BNCO nanowalls. The characterization results indicate that the hybrid structures are composed of the vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls and vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes. Furthermore, the PL characterization results indicate that the PL intensity of the vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures is lower than that of the BNCO nanowalls, and some PL bands of the BNCO nanowalls disappear due to the growth of graphene nanoflakes, i.e., the PL properties of the BNCO nanowalls are altered by the graphene nanoflakes. The changes in the PL properties were interpreted using the charge transfer mechanism. The results of our study can contribute to the synthesis of semiconductor/graphene hybrid structures and the development of next-generation optoelectronic devices.27–33
2. Experimental details and characterization
Prior to the preparation of vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures, the silicon substrates were ultrasonically cleaned for 15 min in toluene, acetone, and ethanol solutions, respectively, and then treated for 15 min in a thermal (75 °C) bath of NH3·H2O, H2O2 and deionised water. A gold film with a thickness of about 15 nm was then deposited via ion sputtering onto the cleaned silicon substrates to promote the nucleation of the graphene nanoflakes and BNCO nanowalls.
The vertically oriented BNCO nanostructures and graphene nanoflakes were synthesized in a PEHFCVD system (Fig. 1) described in detail elsewhere.22 Briefly, a silicon substrate of about 15 × 10 mm size covered with a gold film was placed on a substrate holder in the CVD chamber containing three coiled tungsten filaments and a bias power supply. The B4C sheets pressed using B4C powder were located near the substrate. The distance between the filaments and silicon substrate was about 8 mm. The filaments were heated using an AC power supply to heat the substrate and evaporate B4C. The bias power supply provided a DC voltage to produce plasma, with positive and negative electrodes connected to the filaments and substrate, respectively.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the experimental plasma-enhanced hot filament chemical vapour deposition system used to synthesize graphene nanoflake/BNCO composition using a B4C precursor. N2 and H2 were used as the reactive gases. The bias current in the electric bias system was gradually increased until a blue glow appeared near the substrate, and then it was set to 160 mA to grow the nanowalls. 
When the vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls were synthesized, N2 and H2 gases were supplied to the CVD chamber after evacuation to a basic pressure lower than 2 Pa. The growth pressure was maintained at about 2 × 103 Pa by adjusting the vacuum valve. The filaments were heated to about 1800 °C. Simultaneously, the substrate surface was quickly heated at a heating rate of about 300 °C min−1 due to a short distance between the filaments and substrate. Once the substrate temperature reached the target growth temperature, the N2–H2 plasma was ignited to nucleate and grow the vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls.
The synthesis of the vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes was similar to the growth of the vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls. The samples with the BNCO nanowalls were used as substrates for synthesizing the vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes in the HFCVD system, i.e. without plasma. After the basic pressure in the CVD chamber was lowered below 2 Pa, methane was supplied into the chamber and the growth pressure was maintained at about 2 × 103 Pa. During the growth of the graphene nanoflakes, the filaments were heated to about 2000 °C by the AC current. At the same time, the substrate was quickly heated to the graphene nanoflake growth temperature, and then the temperature was maintained for several minutes to nucleate and grow the graphene nanoflakes. Specifically, five samples A–E were prepared whose growth conditions are listed in Table 1. In particular, sample A is the vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes grown on the silicon substrate covered with a gold film; samples B and C are the vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls grown on silicon substrates covered with a gold film, and samples D and E are the vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes grown on samples B and C, respectively.

The structures and components of the samples were systemically studied using specialized characterization instruments including a Hitachi S-4800 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) (operated at 15 kV), a FEI TECNAI G2 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) (operated at 200 kV), a micro-Raman spectroscope using a 532 nm line semiconductor laser, and an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) using an Al Kα X-ray source. The PL properties were investigated at room temperature using a SPEX 1403 Ramalog system with a 325 nm line He–Cd laser as the excitation source.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and composition of the graphene nanoflakes, BNCO nanowalls and BNCONW/GNF hybrid compositions

Fig. 2 shows the FESEM images of samples A–E, respectively. In Fig. 2, the insets are the surface (top-view) FESEM images corresponding to the samples shown in the panels (b–e). As one can see from Fig. 2, sample A is composed of vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes (since their edges are obviously observed), while samples B–E are composed of vertically oriented nanowalls, respectively. Comparing with the insets in Fig. 2, one can see that samples B and D have different surface morphologies and samples C and E have similar features, which indicate that samples D and E are composed of different nanostructures.
 Fig. 2  Top-view (a) and cross-sectional (b–e) FESEM images of samples A–E, respectively. The insets are the surface (top-view) FESEM images corresponding to the samples shown in the panels (b–e). Sample A is composed of vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes (since their edges can be obviously observed), while samples B–E are composed of vertically oriented nanowalls. The nanoflake thicknesses of samples B and C are about 495 and 457 nm, while the thicknesses of the nanostructures on samples D and E are about 530 and 495 nm. 
Furthermore, the nanoflake thicknesses were obtained using Fig. 2. The nanoflake thicknesses of samples B and C are of about 495 and 457 nm, while the thicknesses of the nanostructures on samples D and E are of about 530 and 495 nm. These data further indicate that samples D and E have new nanostructures formed on samples B and C, respectively. According to the thickness of samples B and C, their growth gates are about 33 and 29 nm min−1. This means that the BNCONWs were grown in a nonlinear mode.
In Fig. 3, the Raman spectrum of sample A shows the D, G, 2D and D + G peaks of graphene nanoflakes at about 1353, 1589, 2702, and 2945 cm−1, respectively.34,35 The strong D peak is related to the defects and edges of the graphene nanoflakes.4,36 The Raman spectra of samples B and C in Fig. 3b show the peaks located at about 1369 and 1585 cm−1, which could be attributed to the vibration of B–N bonds in h-BN and the C–C bonds of aromatic carbon, respectively.22,34
 Fig. 3  Raman spectra of samples A–E. The spectrum of sample A shows the D, G, 2D and D + G peaks of the graphene nanoflakes at about 1353, 1589, 2702, and 2945 cm−1. The strong D peak is related to the edges of the graphene nanoflakes. The spectra of samples B and C show the peaks located at about 1369 and 1585 cm−1. 
The peak at about 1180 cm−1 shown in Fig. 3b relates to the linear CC bonds.37 In the Raman spectra of samples D and E shown in Fig. 3c, there are four main peaks located about 1346, 1589, 2695 and 2941 cm−1, which are assigned to the D, G, 2D, and G + D peaks of the graphene nanoflakes, respectively.34,35 In the Raman spectra of samples D and E, the peaks relating to h-BN do not appear, thus indicating that the graphene nanoflakes cover the BNCO nanowalls.
To further confirm the structure and composition of the synthesized nanomaterials, samples A, C and E were studied using TEM and XPS techniques, and the results are shown in Fig. 4–6. Fig. 4 includes the TEM images of samples A, C and E (insets are the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns corresponding to the samples), indicating that the samples are composed of nanoflakes. From Fig. 4 one can see that the insets show the diffraction spots and dispersive rings, i.e., the samples represent a crystalline structure mixed with amorphous phases.

 Fig. 5  XPS spectra of samples A, C and E. The peaks at about 191, 285, 398 and 533 eV are attributed to B 1s, C 1s, N 1s and O 1s, respectively. The peaks at about 84, 103 and 154 eV are related to Au 4f, Si 2p and Si 2s respectively. 
 Fig. 6  C 1s, N 1s, B 1s and O 1s XPS spectra of samples A, C and E. The spectra were fitted using the standard XPS fitting software (the positions of the fitted peaks are listed in Table 3). The C1 and C2 peaks of samples A and E are attributed to the sp2 C–C and p3 C–C bonds, while the C1 and C2 peaks of sample C result from the CC bonds and CN or C–O bonds, respectively. The O1, O2 and O3 peaks originate from the O–CO, C–O–C and –OH groups. In the N 1s and B 1s spectra of sample C, the N1 and N2 peaks are related to the B–N and CN bonds. 

Fig. 5 presents the XPS spectra of samples A, C and E. The peaks at about 191, 285, 398 and 533 eV in Fig. 5 are attributed to B 1s, C 1s, N 1s and O 1s, respectively. In turn, the peaks at about 84, 103 and 154 eV are related to Au 4f, Si 2p and Si 2s, respectively.38,39 From these XPS results the atomic concentrations of the elements were obtained and they are listed in Table 2. According to the data presented in Table 2, the ratio of boron to nitrogen atoms is about 1.12, which is close to the stoichiometric ratio found in the typical h-BN structure.

Table 2 shows a higher concentrations of oxygen for samples A and C, compared to sample E. The XPS spectra of samples A and C reveal the signals related to Si, while the Si 2p XPS peak of SiO2 is located at about 103 eV.38 Thus, the high oxygen concentrations of samples A and C relate to the native SiO2 present on the surface of the silicon substrates. Due to a low detected depth of XPS, a very low concentration of oxygen in sample E indicates that the graphene nanoflakes contain a small number of oxygen. In other words, the actual oxygen concentration in the BNCO nanoflakes may be much lower than the 12.19% shown in Table 2.

Fig. 6 shows the C 1s, N 1s, B 1s and O 1s XPS spectra of samples A, C and E, respectively. To analyze the binding states of the C, N, B and O elements, we have fitted their XPS spectra using the standard XPS fitting software after Shirley background subtraction. During fitting of the XPS spectra, a 20% Lorentzian–Gaussian parameter was selected. The fitted peaks are shown in Fig. 6, and the positions of the fitted peaks are given in Table 3. In Fig. 6, the C1 and C2 peaks of samples A and E are attributed to the sp2 C–C and p3 C–C bonds,34 while the C1 and C2 peaks of sample C result from the CC bonds and CN or C–O bonds, respectively.22 The O1, O2 and O3 peaks shown in Fig. 6 originate from the O–CO, C–O–C and –OH groups, respectively.34,40 In the N 1s and B 1s XPS spectra of sample C shown in Fig. 6, the N1 and N2 peaks are related to the B–N and CN bonds, while the B1 and B2 peaks are associated with the B–N and N–B–O bonds, respectively.38,41

According to the above described analyses, we can conclude that sample A is the vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes, while samples B and C are the vertically oriented h-BN structures mixed with carbon and oxygen impurities (i.e., BNCO structures), and samples D and E are the vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrids.
Comparing the SEM images, as well as the Raman and XPS spectra of sample C, with the results shown in ref. 22, one can see that the structure and composition of the BNCONWs are almost the same as the structure and composition of the BNCO nanowalls discussed in ref. 22 However, the structure of the GNFs grown on the BNCONWs differs from the structure of GNFs grown on carbon dots.35,42 From Fig. 3c it can be seen that the intensity ratio of 2D to G peaks is about 0.56 and 0.54 for samples D and E, i.e. it is lower than the ratio (0.65–0.97) of GNFs in ref. 35 and 42. Due to the decrease of 2D to G peak intensity ratio with the increase of graphene layers,42 one can conclude that the GNFs grown on the BNCONWs are thicker than the GNFs grown on the carbon dots.
3.2 Formation of vertically oriented BNCO/GNF hybrids
In the recently published studies,22,43 the formation of vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes and BNCO nanostructures on gold films was studied. Due to the Gibbs–Thomson (G–T) effect, carbon atoms dissolved in gold nanoparticles are driven out to form the graphene nanoflakes on the surfaces of the gold nanoparticles. Furthermore, the vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes are formed owing to the stress in the graphene fragments.43 The Gibbs–Thomson (G–T) effect is the reduction of supersaturation with the decrease of growth seed size, resulting in a high separation rate of precursor atoms as the catalyst particles become smaller. This is similar to the G–T effect in a single-walled carbon nanotube nucleation.44 The formation of vertically oriented BNCO nanostructures originates from the assembly of BN molecules on the surfaces of gold nanoparticles, and incorporation of B2O3 molecules and carbon atoms into h-BN nanoflakes, where the BN and B2O3 molecules, as well as carbon atoms, are produced by the specific reactions of B4C with the residual oxygen and NH3+ formed in the N2–H2 plasma, which are described in ref. 22. The evaporation of the B4C compound results in the formation of carbon and boron: B4C → 4B + C.(1)
Owing to the ion bombardment, sputtering of the B4C sheets can also lead to the formation of carbon and boron. The reaction of boron and oxygen results in the formation of B2O3: B + O2 → B2O3.(2)
Moreover, B4C can directly react with O2 to form B2O3: B4C + O2 → B2O3 + CO2,(3) and the reaction of B2O3 with NH3+ leads to the formation of BN: B2O3 + 2NH3+ + 2e → 2BN + 3H2O.(4)
Due to the incorporation of carbon and oxygen into h-BN, stress is formed in the BNCO nanostructures. The stress accumulated in the BNCO nanostructures results in the vertically oriented growth (the detailed description of the formation process can be found in ref. 22). Here, the formation of BNCONW/GNF hybrids is discussed.
During the growth of the vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes, CH4 is decomposed by the action of hot filaments into the hydrocarbon radicals and atomic hydrogen.43 CH4 → CH3 + [H],(5)where [H] represents atomic hydrogen, which has a high activity. These hydrocarbon radicals and active hydrogen atoms move to the top surfaces of the vertically oriented BNCO samples via diffusion due to the temperature difference between the filaments and substrate, and react mutually to form carbon atoms. CH3 + [H] → C + 2H2.(6)
From Fig. 2b and c one can see that the top edges of the vertically oriented BNCO nanoflakes are connected together, i.e., there are a number of micro-pits in the joints between the two edges of the vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls, which serve as nucleation centres for the carbon clusters due to the low local nucleation energy.45 Originating from these carbon clusters, the graphene nanoflakes are easily formed.46 From Fig. 6 it can also be seen that the graphene nanoflakes contain sp3 carbon, which results in the generation of stress in the graphene nanoflakes. As a result, the original planar growth of graphene nanoflakes is transferred into upward growth, and finally, the vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes are formed.3 On the other hand, the dangling bonds on the edges of the vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls, which may result from the plasma ion bombardment, can serve as the nucleation sites for the vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes,3i.e., the vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls serve as the growth templates for the vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes. Due to the continuous deposition of hydrocarbon radicals and active hydrogen atoms, the formed carbon atoms eventually bond to the active edges of the vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes, thus promoting their further growth.
From Fig. 2b and c one can see that the edges of the BNCO nanowalls are randomly oriented, this indicates that the micro-pits and growth templates are disordered. As a result, the edges of the vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes are tangled together to form maze-like structures as shown in Fig. 2d and e.
3.3 PL properties of BNCO/graphene nanoflake hybrids

Fig. 7 shows the PL spectra of samples A–E. As shown in Fig. 7, sample A generates a strong green PL band at about 513 nm and a weak blue PL band at about 413 nm, respectively. Sample B generates weak ultraviolet (UV) PL bands at about 360 and 380 nm, relatively strong blue PL bands at about 411 and 443 nm, and a strong green PL band at about 485 nm. Sample C emits weak blue PL bands at about 403 and 417 nm, a strong green PL band at about 511 nm, and a very red PL band at about 660 nm, respectively. Samples D and E emit almost the same blue and green PL bands at about 407 and 514 nm, respectively. The PL band at about 653 nm of samples D and E is due to the second order reflection of a laser on the grating spectrometer, because the 325 nm line He–Cd laser was used for the excitation light.47
 Fig. 7  PL spectra of samples A–E. Sample A generates a strong green PL band at about 513 nm and a weak blue PL band at about 413 nm. Sample B generates weak UV PL bands at about 360 and 380 nm, relatively strong blue PL bands at about 411 and 443 nm, and a strong green PL band at about 485 nm. Sample C emits weak blue PL bands at about 403 and 417 nm, a strong green PL band at about 511 nm, and a very red PL band at about 660 nm. Samples D and E emit almost the same blue and green PL bands at about 407 and 514 nm. 
From Fig. 7 we have obtained the intensity ratios of green PL bands of samples A, D and E; they are about 2.37 for samples A and D and 1.73 for samples A and E, respectively. These data indicate that the PL properties of samples D and E are different from that of sample A, although the surfaces of samples D and E are graphene nanoflakes. Comparing the PL spectra of samples B and D shown in Fig. 7b, one can see that the UV and blue PL bands in the PL spectrum of sample B disappear in the spectrum of sample D, and the 1.38 intensity ratio of the green PL bands of samples B and D indicates that the PL intensity of sample B is stronger than that of sample D; this indicates that the PL properties of sample B are altered by the graphene nanoflakes. Comparison with the PL spectra of samples C and E (Fig. 7c) shows that their PL properties are similar to that of samples B and D, i.e., the blue PL bands emitted from sample C disappear in the PL spectrum of sample E, and the PL intensity of sample C is stronger than that of sample E since the green PL intensity ratio of samples C and E is about 1.1.

3.3.1 PL generation. 
Generation of the PL bands of the graphene nanoflakes and BNCO nanostructures was described in previously published papers.22,35 The generation of the blue and green PL bands of the graphene nanoflakes is attributed to the ethyl radicals termed on the graphene nanoflakes, to the transition between the σ* and π bands and the transition between the π* and π bands, respectively.35
In the case of the BNCO nanowalls, the generation of PL bands is related to the defects in the nanowalls. Since the BNCO nanowalls are essentially the h-BN structures mixed with carbon and oxygen impurities, they contain the nitrogen vacancy levels termed by the three boron centre (VN3) and one boron centre (VN1) and the impurity levels related to carbon and oxygen. Among these defect levels, the VN3 and VN1 levels are located below the conduction band of BN (about 1.0 and 0.7 eV) and carbon and oxygen impurity levels below the conduction band of BN about 4.1 and 4.5 eV, respectively.18 According to the transition mechanism, the generation of UV PL bands can be attributed to the transition between the VN3 level and the oxygen impurity level; the blue PL bands originate from the transition between the VN3 level and the carbon impurity level; and the green PL bands relate to the transition between the π* and π bands of the carbon clusters formed in the BNCO nanowalls.22 The generation of the red PL band of sample B is associated with the –OH groups.48
Since both samples B and C are h-BN structures mixed with carbon and oxygen, one can naturally ask why Fig. 7 shows a great blue shift of the green PL band of sample B compared to sample C? Apparently, it is related to the carbon doping in h-BN. The XPS results indicate that the vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls contain a small number of carbon and oxygen, i.e., they can be considered as the carbon and oxygen co-doped or incorporated h-BN. Doping of carbon in the h-BN structure results in the coexistence of graphite and BN phases, which feature the structure of aromatic rings surrounded by BN lattices.9 The PL properties of the carbon clusters are related to their size, i.e., small carbon clusters have a wide bandgap, which results in the blue shift of the PL bands.35,48,49 The short growth time of sample B leads to a low carbon concentration in the BNCO structures,22 which means that the size of the carbon clusters is small. As a result, the green PL band of sample B has a great blue shift.


3.3.2 PL properties of hybrid vertical BNCONW/GNF structures. 

Fig. 7b and c show that the UV and blue bands of samples B and C disappear in the PL spectra of samples D and E, while the intensity of the green PL bands is slightly reduced. These PL properties of the vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures are also observed in the hybrid graphene/ZnO structures, i.e., the UV PL quenching or enhancement occurs in the hybrid graphene/ZnO structures,24,26 however the change in the green PL band is related to the content of graphene.24 The changes in the PL properties are related to the electron transfer and the interface defects of hybrid structures.
Since the vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls can be considered as the carbon and oxygen co-doped or incorporated h-BN structure, the electronic properties of the BNCO nanowalls can be analyzed on the basis of h-BN. Due to the carbon doping, the bandgap of h-BN can reduce to ≈3 eV depending on the content of carbon.18 The oxygen incorporation in the h-BN structure leads to the injection of electrons into the conjugated π bond, which is similar to nitrogen doping in graphene;9 in other words, the BNCO nanowalls can be considered as an n-type semiconductor, thus the vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrid structure is similar to the ZnO/graphene hybrid structure.24 Shayeganfar and his co-workers studied the electronic structure of a graphene/h-BN nanotube hybrid system, and the results indicate that the conduction band of the hybrid structure is higher than that of graphene;50 thus, the conduction band of the graphene nanoflakes is below the conduction band of the vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrid structure. Hence, the disappearance of the UV and blue PL bands can be attributed to the electron transfer from the conducting band of the hybrid structure to the conducting band of the graphene nanoflakes according to the electron transfer mechanism in the graphene/ZnO hybrid structure.24
Due to the electron transfer from the conducting band of the hybrid structure to the conducting band of the graphene nanoflakes, the radiation from the vertically oriented BNCO nanoflakes cannot be trapped by the interface layers of the hybrid structures, so no plasmons are induced in the graphene nanoflakes.26 As a result, the UV and blue PL bands are not improved; reversely, they disappear.
Although h-BN has a structure similar to that of graphene, there is a definite mismatch between h-BN and graphene,11 which implies some distorted states and dangling bonds in the interface layers of the hybrid BNCONW/GNF structures.34 These distorted states and dangling bonds are the PL quenching centers,34 thus the green PL intensity of the hybrid BNCONW/GNF structures is lowered.


3.3.3 Difference in the PL properties of samples A, D and E. 
As described in Section 3.1, sample A is the vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes grown from the gold nanoparticles formed from the gold film by heating the substrate,43 while samples D and E are the vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes formed on the vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls. Due to the interaction of light with the gold nanoparticles, the local surface plasmons are produced in the gold nanoparticles.51 As a result, a local electric field is induced on the gold nanoparticles and enhances the PL emission of the vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes.52 However, the distorted states and dangling bonds in the interface layers53 of the vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures lead to lowering of the PL intensity. It is the reason why the PL intensity of sample A is stronger than that of samples D and E.

4. Potential applications of the hybrid vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF structures

Fig. 7b and c show that the UV and blue PL bands disappear in the spectra of samples D and E, thus indicating that the UV and some blue light can be filtered by the vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures. Thus, the vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures can be used to fabricate the optical filter devices. The disappearance of UV and blue PL bands results from the electron transfer from the vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls to the graphene nanoflakes, i.e., a number of electrons can be collected if an electrode is connected to the graphene nanoflakes. Furthermore, Fig. 2 shows that the vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures feature a number of 3D nano-containers, which possess the light trapping effect.34 In other words, the vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures can improve the conversion efficiency of solar cells in the UV-visible region. In addition, due to extreme chemical and mechanical inertness of graphene and very high efficiency of the boron nitride compound in the electric propulsion devices,54 the graphene/BN compounds could be efficient for self-healing and adaptive electric propulsion equipment55 such as Hall-type thrusters.56–58
5. Conclusion
In summary, the vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures were prepared via the synthesis of vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls using the PEHFCVD technique, and the direct growth of the vertically oriented graphene nanoflakes using the HFCVD method. The formation of the vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures results from the nucleation of the graphene nanoflakes on the edges of the vertically oriented BNCO nanowalls and the stress formed in the graphene nanoflakes. The PL properties of the vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures were studied using the 325 nm line He–Cd laser, and the differences in the PL properties of the vertically oriented BNCONW/GNF hybrid structures compared to the graphene nanoflakes and BNCO nanowalls were demonstrated. These differences are reasonably interpreted using the charge transfer mechanism. Thus, the possibility to tune the photoluminescence of the complex hierarchical nanostructure was demonstrated. These achievements can contribute to the design of semiconductor/graphene hybrid structures for the development of next-generation electronic and optoelectronic nanodevices.
