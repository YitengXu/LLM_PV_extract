    , Accepted 12th May 2022First published on 13th May 2022AbstractTransition metal selenides have been widely used as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of their considerable theoretical capacity and good conductivity. Nevertheless, volume expansion is a serious problem that restricts their performance. Herein, a CoSe2/N-doped carbon heterojunction with a 3D porous structure (CoSe2@NC) is synthesized using a topological transformation process. The generated heterojunction structure and 3D porous structure endow CoSe2@NC with accelerated electron/ion transfer ratio and excellent structural stability. As the anode, the CoSe2@NC based half-cell shows superior rate properties (476.4 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 372.2 mA h g−1 at 10.0 A g−1) and good cycling stability (354.1 mA h g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 after 800 cycles). Moreover, the CoSe2@NC||NVPOF full cell, assembled by coupling with Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF), exhibits a high energy density (136.6 W h kg−1) under a power density of 185.8 W kg−1. This reflects the great potential of the use of CoSe2@NC in the direction of energy storage.
1. Introduction
With the global proposal of carbon neutrality and emissions peak, the importance of new energy has become increasingly prominent. Among the existing new energy storage technologies, the electrochemical energy storage represented by lithium batteries is the most mature candidate.1–3 Their large-scale application, however, is heavily restricted by the safety performance of lithium-ion batteries along with the scarcity of Li resources.4,5 Owing to the similar energy storage mechanism and rich reserve of Na, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are expected to become a new energy storage device to replace lithium-ion batteries.6–8 However, the radius of Na+ (1.02 Å) is much larger than that of Li+ (0.76 Å), resulting in an inferior cycle life relative to those of commercial lithium-ion batteries.9,10 For example, although graphite is the main commercial anode material in the lithium-ion battery economy, the weakness of low reversible capacity and Na plating behavior greatly inhibit its application in SIBs.11,12 Consequently, it is of great importance to design superior anode materials for the rapid shuttling of sodium ions.
As electrode materials, transition metal selenides (TMSs) with unique properties have been rapidly developed in the fields of secondary batteries, such as supercapacitors, fuel cells and solar cells.13–15 Besides this, TMSs also play an important role in anode electrode materials for SIBs. TMSs can be divided into those with a layered structure (MoSe2, TiSe2, etc.) or a non-layered structure (FeSe2, CoSe2, NiSe2, etc.).16–21 Layered metal selenides with three-layer structures (Se–M–Se) are good for sodium-ion insertion/extraction, and non-layered metal selenides have the advantages of being low cost and having a high theoretical capacity.22–24 However, on account of their low conductivity and huge volume strain during cycling, the rate performance and cycling properties of TMSs still need to be further improved.25,26 The recombination with carbon-based materials could accelerate the rate of electron transfer, as well as buffer the volume change induced by the electrochemical process.27 Zhang et al. prepared three-dimensional honeycomb-like MoSe2/RGO nanocomposites, which delivered a high discharge specific capacity (300.3 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1) and still had a capacity of 247.0 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles.28 Cho et al. designed one-dimensional nanomaterial-hollow FeSe2 nanospheres coated with graphite carbon, which are decorated on the surface of RGO nanofibers. When the current density was 1.0 A g−1, the discharge capacity reached 412.6 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 82%. The excellent properties are attributed to the synergism of the hollow structure of the FeSe2 nanospheres and RGO matrix.29 Though various advances have been achieved, the performance of these anode electrode materials is still not ideal at high current densities.
For the past few years, 3D porous materials have exhibited enormous potential in the field of sodium ion storage. The open pores and short diffusion paths promote the diffusion of electrolytes and the fast transfer of Na+, thus improving the rate performance of SIBs.30 Moreover, the 3D structure could also reduce the volume change of the electrode materials during the charge–discharge process, bringing excellent cyclic stability. Chen et al. synthesized 3D porous carbon aerogels using sodium chloride as a template through in situ polymerization and condensation under the condition of high salt, which showed excellent cycle stability (155.4 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles under 0.5 A g−1).31 Qiu et al. proved that 3D porous hard–soft composite carbon synthesized by introducing sodium chloride as a template during carbonization process could significantly improve the electrochemical properties of SIBs.32 However, most of the 3D porous structures were prepared by using template method, which is difficult to produce on a large scale.
In this paper, CoSe2 particles imbedded in N-doped carbon were prepared by a topological transformation process. Owing to the synergy between the 3D porous structure and CoSe2/N-doped carbon heterojunction, the CoSe2@NC exhibits an excellent rate performance (476.4 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 372.2 mA h g−1 at 10.0 A g−1) and good cycling stability (354.1 mA h g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 after 800 cycles). Kinetic analysis shows that the pseudo-capacitance contribution plays a leading role in the process of the electrode reaction. Impressively, by coupling with the Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF) cathode, the CoSe2@NC||NVPOF full cell shows the high capacity of 300 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 40 cycles. Moreover, it also delivers a high energy density of 136.6 W h kg−1, proving it to be a promising anode candidate for use in SIBs.
2. Experimental section
Synthesis of CoSe2@NC
In detail, 1 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K30) and 1.5 g of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate were firstly added into 30 mL of ultra-pure water under ultrasonic treatment. Then, the obtained uniform solution was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. After lyophilization, the powders were annealed at 700 °C for 120 min under the flow of nitrogen to obtain Co@NC. Finally, the Co@NC was converted to CoSe2@NC through a selenization process, in which Co@NC and selenium powders were uniformly mixed in a mass ratio of 1:3 and annealed at 500 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 3 h.
Synthesis of Na3V2(PO4)2O2F
Firstly, V2O5 (1 mmol) and H2C2O4 (3 mmol) were dissolved in deionized water under stirring at 70 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, a certain amount of NH4H2PO4 and NaF were both added. Ammonia solution was used to adjust the pH value to 7.0. Then, the prepared homogenous solution was hydrothermally treated at 170 °C for 12 h. Finally, Na3V2(PO4)2O2F was washed with deionized water several times and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C.
Materials characterization
A powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D/MAX-2000) equipped with a copper Kα radiation source (λ = 0.154 nm) was used to explore the composition of the particles. The valence information was measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB). The morphology and microstructure were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU-9010) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM, TECanig-20). The crystal structure and element composition were measured by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), high-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were adopted to identify the BET surface area (QuadraSorb SI surface area analyzer).
Electrochemical measurements
The electrodes were prepared via coating an active material slurry on a copper foil collector and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h. The active material slurry consists of the as-synthesized samples, single-walled carbon nanotubes and polyvinylidene fluoride in a weight ratio of 7:2:1 in N-methylpyrrolidone dispersant. The button battery, including the metal sodium, glass fiber membrane (WhatmanGF/D) and electrolyte (1.0 M NaPF6 solution), was assembled in an argon-filled glove box. A multi-channel battery test system (NEWAREBTS-610) was used to evaluate the performance of the button batteries. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a CHI 760E. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was examined in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz–100 kHz. The full sodium battery was assembled by coupling CoSe2@NC with Na3V2(PO4)2O2F.
Computational method
Theoretical calculations were performed via the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).33 In order to depict the ground state ion-electron wavefunction, the projected augmented wave (PAW) method was used. The electron exchange correlation was expressed by using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and the cutoff energy of the plane wave basis group was 400 eV. The convergence criterion of geometric optimization was set to 10−5 eV and 0.02 eV Å−1 for energy and force, respectively. The 6 × 6 × 6 k-point lattice of the γ-center was used to execute the lattice optimization of the CoSe2 cell (Pa symmetry). The relaxation lattice parameters (5.83 Å) were consistent with the experimental results (5.86 Å) and the two-layer structure of the CoSe2 (210) plane was obtained. The N-doped carbon (NC) was modeled by replacing one carbon atom with one nitrogen atom in the orthorhombic graphene layer and the CoSe2 (210) surface was applied to construct the CoSe2@NC heterostructure.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a schematically shows the fabrication strategy of the CoSe2@NC. The precursor, Co@NC, was obtained by pyrolysis of the complex generated by the coordination of Co2+ and PVP. The XRD pattern (Fig. S1†) of Co@NC reveals that Co2+ is converted into Co after thermal annealing. Fig. S2a and S2b† are the SEM images of Co@NC, which show that the Co@NC precursor possesses a 3D porous morphology. Further observation of Co@NC in the TEM image (Fig. S2c†) shows that the nitrogen-doped carbon matrix is uniformly coated by many particles with no agglomeration. Clear lattice fringes could be seen from the HRTEM image (Fig. S2d†) and the interplanar spacing of 0.20 nm corresponds to the (111) crystal plane of Co, which is in line with the XRD pattern (Fig. S1†). The HAADF diagram and EDX mapping diagram (Fig. S2e†) display the even distribution of Co, N, and C elements across the whole carbon flake, which further reveals the existence of Co.

After selenization, the Co on nitrogen-doped carbon was topologically transformed into CoSe2 particles. The XRD pattern (Fig. 1b) shows the formation of cobalt selenide, in which the peaks at 30.5°, 34.2°, 37.6°, 51.8°, 56.5° and 58.8° correspond to (200), (210), (211), (311), (230) and (321) of CoSe2 (PDF#09-0234), respectively. In addition, the nitrogen adsorption and desorption curve (Fig. 1c) shows the specific surface area of CoSe2@NC is 15.0 m2 g−1. Subsequently, the valence information of CoSe2@NC is further analyzed by XPS. Fig. S3† shows the full spectrum of XPS, in which the peaks of Co 2p, Se 3d, C 1s and N 1s are clearly visible, confirming the presence of Co, Se, C and N. Fig. 1d illustrates the high-resolution C 1s spectrum of CoSe2@NC. The three peaks located at 284.8 eV, 286.2 eV and 288.9 eV are assigned to CC, C–C and C–Se.34 Among them, the existence of C–Se shows the interaction between the CoSe2 particles and nitrogen-doped carbon substrate. The N 1s spectrum, as illustrated in Fig. 1e, could be fitted to three peaks, namely pyridine N (398.9 eV), pyrrole N (401.1 eV) and graphite N (406.2 eV).35 The existence of graphite N also demonstrates that the nitrogen was doped in carbon substrate. In the Se 3d spectrum (Fig. 1f), three fitted peaks can be obtained at 54.9 eV, 55.9 eV and 59.2 eV, which could be assigned to Se 3d5/2, Se 3d3/2 and the SeOx.22,36 The Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 1g) shows the existence of four fitted peaks, accompanied by two satellite peaks. The fitted peaks at 778.7 and 793.7 eV are assigned to Co3+, while the peaks at 780.8 and 796.8 eV are associated with the Co2+, indicating the mixed valences of cobalt in CoSe2@NC.37,38 The 3D porous structure morphology of CoSe2@NC is distinctly observed in the SEM image, as shown in Fig. 2a. A closer observation (Fig. 2b) further indicates that the porous structure of the Co@NC precursor (Fig. S2†) is well preserved after the topotactic conversion process. The 3D porous structure may validly alleviate the strain in bulk during the electrochemical cycles, as well as the acceleration the full infiltration of electrolyte, which is beneficial for enhancing sodium storage performance.39 The TEM (Fig. 2c) and HAADF image (Fig. 2d) of CoSe2@NC reveal that there are large numbers of cobalt selenide particles on the nitrogen-doped carbon substrate. It can be clearly observed that the average diameter of the cobalt selenide particles is ∼50 nm. As shown in HRTEM (Fig. 2e and f), the d-spacing of 0.26 nm is associated with the (210) crystal plane of cobalt selenide, in line with the result of the XRD pattern (Fig. 1b). Besides, the obvious demarcation between cobalt selenide and nitrogen-doped carbon substrate can be observed in Fig. 2e, proving the generation of the CoSe2/N-doped carbon heterojunction. The coexistence and homogeneous location of Se, Co, N and C elements are further proved by the EDX mappings (Fig. 2g). For comparison, pure phase cobalt selenide without the nitrogen-doped carbon substrate was also prepared, which is identified by the result of the XRD pattern (Fig. S4†). As shown in Fig. S5,† the as-synthesized pure cobalt selenide shows a granular structure with the average size of 100 nm, accompanied by severe agglomeration. This phenomenon reveals that the nitrogen-doped carbon framework can efficiently avoid the agglomeration of cobalt selenide particles. As a result, CoSe2@NC with a 3D porous structure is successfully constructed. The special 3D porous structure may alleviate the volume change during the sodiation/desodiation process, which improves the cyclic stability and suppresses the growth and agglomeration of cobalt selenide, providing abundant active sites toward improved sodium storage.

To evaluate the Na-ion storage performance, coin-type half-cells with CoSe2@NC as the anode material were assembled. Fig. 3a depicts the CV curves, where a strong peak at 1.06 V in the initial cycle is owing to the solid electrolyte (SEI) film produced by the anode material during the first discharge process.40 During the initial five cycles between 0.01 V and 3.0 V at 0.1 mV s−1, the reduction peak at 1.45 V could be attributed to the insertion of the Na ion into the interlayer of cobalt selenide to form NaxCoSe2 and the following two reduction peaks at 1.14 V and 0.76 V correspond to the transition from NaxCoSe2 to CoSe/Na2Se and finally to Co/Na2Se.41 The oxidation peak at 1.81 V shows the transformation from Co to CoSe2.42 Moreover, the excellent coincidence of the initial five cycles reveals that CoSe2@NC has excellent reversible performance as an anode material for SIBs. Fig. 3b illustrates the corresponding charge–discharge curves of CoSe2@NC under 0.1 A g−1, in which the discharging and charging platform in the voltage curve bring into correspondence with the redox peak of the CV curves. The initial discharge and charge capacity are 754.9 mA h g−1 and 598.8 mA h g−1, with 79.3% initial coulombic efficiency (ICE). For comparison, the ICE of the pure cobalt selenide electrode is only 72.3% (Fig. S6a†). The cycle performance of CoSe2@NC and CoSe2 is demonstrated in Fig. 3c. Under 1.0 A g−1, CoSe2@NC maintains the discharge capacity of 470.0 mA h g−1 with 100% Coulomb efficiency (CE) during 200 cycles. In contrast, the specific capacity of pure cobalt selenide can only be restored at 320.0 mA h g−1. The rate profiles of CoSe2@NC and CoSe2 anode at diverse current densities are illustrated in Fig. 3d. Under different discharge current densities, CoSe2@NC can achieve high specific capacities of 590.5, 476.4, 422.2, 407.2, 395.5, 380.4 and 372.2 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0 A g−1, respectively. Besides, even at 20.0 and 30.0 A g−1, it still exhibits no obvious capacity attenuation with the capacity of 350.1 and 324.9 mA h g−1, while the pure CoSe2 demonstrates much lower capacity at the corresponding current density, indicating the better rate performance of CoSe2@NC. Compared with pure CoSe2 from the voltage platform diagram (Fig. 3e and S6b†), it can be further identified that CoSe2@NC has exceptional rate capability as an anode material for SIBs. Fig. 3f compares CoSe2@NC with other reported CoSe2-based electrodes, which demonstrates the excellent rate performance of CoSe2@NC.36,39,43–47 The cyclic stability of CoSe2@NC under 5.0 A g−1 is further evaluated, as illustrated in Fig. 3g. After 800 cycles, it still exhibits the capacity of 354.1 mA h g−1 with up to 98% capacity retention and 100% CE. However, the corresponding capacity retention of pure cobalt selenide is only 82%, again confirming the superior durability of CoSe2@NC.

To reveal the reason for the excellent sodium storage properties of the CoSe2@NC electrode, the charge transfer kinetics of the electrode material was studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), with the results shown in Fig. S7.† The fitted value of charge transfer resistance (Rct) for CoSe2@NC is 112 Ω, which is much smaller than that of pure cobalt selenide (259 Ω). Therefore, CoSe2@NC has excellent electronic conductivity and charge transport capacity, resulting in higher reversible capacity and better rate performance. Furthermore, CV tests are enforced to analyze the contribution of pseudocapacitance and diffusion. The CV curves (Fig. 4a) illustrate the increased redox peaks with a similar shape, indicating the stable sodium storage performance of the CoSe2@NC electrode. In addition, with increasing scanning rates, the slight shift of the redox peaks is due to the existence of polarization. To qualitatively analyze the electrochemical reaction process, the connection between peak current i and scanning rate v is described by the following formula:48i = avb
 Fig. 4  Kinetic analysis of CoSe2@NC. (a) CV curves at various scan rates from 0.1 to 3.0 mV s−1. (b) The linear relationship of log(i) vs. log(v). (c) The pseudocapacitive contribution (green region) to the total current at a scan rate of 1.0 mV s−1. (d) The contribution ratio of the pseudocapacitive and diffusion-controlled charges versus the scan rate. 
As illustrated in Fig. 4b, the fitted b values of 0.93, 0.94, 0.82, 0.93 and 0.98 at different scanning rates, respectively, imply that both diffusion and pseudocapacitance contribute to sodium storage in the CoSe2@NC anode. In addition, at a given scanning rate, the detailed capacity contribution of the diffusion-type and the pseudocapacitance-type process could be obtained via the subsequent equation:49i(V) = a1v + a2v1/2i(V)/v1/2 = a1v1/2 + a2
In the formula, a1v is the contribution of the pseudocapacitance-type interface Na+ storage process, and a2v1/2 reflects the contribution of diffusion-type sodiation and desodiation. As illustrated in Fig. 4c and d, the contribution of pseudocapacitance-controlled process increases with the growth of scan rates. The pseudocapacitive contribution of the CoSe2@NC electrode reaches 98.6% and 99.4% at the scanning rates of 1.0 mV s−1 and 3.0 mV s−1. Such a high pseudocapacitive contribution is principally because of the favorable conductivity and 3D porous framework formed by the combination of cobalt selenide and nitrogen-doped carbon substrate. The CV results demonstrate that the pseudocapacitive behavior makes a vital contribution to the whole capacity of CoSe2@NC at high current densities, which is in line with its outstanding rate performance (Fig. 3d).
To deeply analyze the Na+ storage mechanism of CoSe2@NC, ex situ measurements were determined. Fig. 5a illustrates the corresponding ex situ XRD pattern during the electrochemical process (Fig. 5b), in which the whole evolution of CoSe2@NC can be clearly observed during the initial charge–discharge process. In the discharge process, the electrode material mainly undergoes the Na+ intercalation reaction when the discharge voltage is above 1.5 V. The yellow line in the ex situ XRD pattern (Fig. 5a) demonstrates the pristine CoSe2 with the characteristic peaks at 30.6°, 34.2° and 37.6°. With the proceedings of discharge, new peaks appear along with the gradual disappearance of CoSe2 peaks. When discharged to 1.0 V, the new diffraction peaks of Co (44.6°) and Na2Se (26.3°) can be detected, demonstrating that the overall evolution of CoSe2@NC during the discharge process is the intercalation and the conversion process between CoSe2@NC and Na+ (CoSe2 + 4Na+ + 4e− → 2Na2Se + Co).49,50 This phenomenon is more visible when fully discharged to 0.01 V. The ex-TEM analyses of CoSe2@NC at the fully discharged state are illustrated in Fig. S8a–c.† The almost invariable morphology of CoSe2@NC after being fully discharged reveals its superior stability (Fig. S8a†). In the HRTEM image (Fig. S8b†), the existence of Co (111) and Na2Se (400) crystal planes demonstrates the formation of Co and Na2Se. Upon the subsequent charging process, the CoSe2 diffraction peaks can again be detected, which is also confirmed by the corresponding ex-TEM (Fig. S8e†), in line with the result of ex-XRD, revealing the de-intercalation of Na+ (2Na2Se + Co → CoSe2 + 4Na+ + 4e−). The 3D porous structure (Fig. S8d†) and good dispersion of C, Co and Se elements (Fig. S8f†) show the uniform desodiation process. Fig. 5c and d illustrate the morphology of the CoSe2@NC electrode after ten charge–discharge cycles. The preserved 3D porous structure and uniform dispersion of the CoSe2 particles on N-doped carbon further reveal the excellent reversibility of CoSe2@NC. A clear lattice distance can be seen in the HRTEM image (Fig. 5e) and the spacing of 0.26 nm corresponds to the (210) crystal plane of cobalt selenide. The coexistence and even distribution of the Se, Co, N, and C elements are proved from the EDX mapping images (Fig. 5f).

Inspired by the exceptional electrochemical properties of CoSe2@NC, the Na+ full cells were assembled. The Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (denoted as NVPOF) cathode material was prepared via a simple hydrothermal process. Fig. S9a and b† show the corresponding XRD pattern and SEM image, proving that the NVPOF was successfully obtained. The charge–discharge curves (Fig. S9c†) illustrate its excellent electrochemical property. The charge–discharge curves of the whole battery in the initial five cycles are displayed in Fig. 6a, revealing the initial charge/discharge capacity of 365.5 and 278.1 mA h g−1 with the ICE of 76.1%. Rate properties of CoSe2@NC||NVPOF are demonstrated in Fig. 6b and S10.† The specific capacity at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 A g−1 can reach up to 290.9, 270.4, 206.6 and 123.6 mA h g−1, respectively. When the current density is restored to 0.1 A g−1, the initial capacity (290.9 mA h g−1) can also be maintained, which proves that the full cell has a favorable reversibility. Fig. 6c exhibits the cycling performance of CoSe2@NC||NVPOF. After 40 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, the capacity is still 300.0 mA h g−1 with about 100% CE. Two CoSe2@NC||NVPOF full batteries can light up a group of LED bulbs, which proves the excellent prospect of CoSe2@NC materials in the domain of electrochemical storage (inset in Fig. 6c). The Ragone plot (Fig. 6d) demonstrates that the energy density can reach 136.6, 126.3, 93.3 and 52.8 W h kg−1 at the power density of 185.8, 371.5, 897.2 and 1703.2 W kg−1, respectively, which is better than those of the full cells mentioned in other works.51–55 This also proves the excellent prospects of CoSe2@NC in the field of electrochemical energy storage.

(d) A comparison of the Ragone plots with other reported Na+ full cells. 
Theoretical calculations were also performed to analyze the conductance of CoSe2 (210) surface with and without NC. As displayed by the charge density difference in Fig. 7a, the formation of the heterostructure induces evident charge transfer from the CoSe2 (210) surface to NC, causing the accumulation of positive charge on the CoSe2 surface and negative charge on NC. The planar-average charge density plot quantitatively reflects the difference between positive and negative charges on the surface of cobalt selenide and NC (Fig. 7b). Fig. 7c and d are the projected density of states (PDOS) diagrams, which illustrate that both the CoSe2 (210) and CoSe2@NC heterostructure are conductors. It is found that the existence of NC renders the conductance of heterostructure to be higher than the CoSe2 (210) surface, along with the vanishing of the gap in conduction band (around 5 eV) and valence band (−6 to −12 eV). This reveals the generation of the CoSe2/N-doped carbon interface is better for electron transport, which is in line with the EIS results (Fig. S7†).

4. Conclusions
In summary, a CoSe2@NC composite was synthesized using a topotactic transformation process. The 3D porous nitrogen-doped carbon network substrate and CoSe2 active particles endow the CoSe2@NC composites with favorable electrochemical performance as anode materials for SIBs. The capacity of 354.1 mA h g−1 can be maintained at a current density of 5.0 A g−1 after 800 cycles and the coulombic efficiency remains around 100% during the cycles, demonstrating outstanding cycling life. More importantly, the capacity of the CoSe2@NC||NVPOF full cell is maintained at 300.0 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. Meanwhile, it has a high energy density of 136.6 W h kg−1. The effective synthesis strategy proposed in this paper provides a new concept for the construction of high-performance SIB anode materials.
