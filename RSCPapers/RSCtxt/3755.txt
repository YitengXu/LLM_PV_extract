    , Accepted 3rd July 2019First published on 9th July 2019AbstractSignificant efforts have been devoted to design and develop supported catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems since they have enhanced electrocatalytic activity. The interfacial effects between the support and catalyst could control electron distribution, tune intermediate adsorption, prevent catalysts from dense aggregation, and improve stability. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in supported catalysts for promoting electrocatalysis relevant to renewable energy technologies. It starts with the rational selection and synthesis of supported catalysts, and strategies to improve the support. Then, recent improvements in the vital electrocatalytic reactions (hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO2 reduce reaction (CO2RR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), etc.) are discussed, respectively. Finally, the challenges and opportunities are presented for this promising field.
1. Introduction
Due to the rapidly growing energy demand and environmental issues, it is an increasingly concerning issue in scientific research to employ renewable natural energy, such as solar, wind energy, and hydropower, to replace fossil fuels. Direct use of electricity produced from these natural sources is difficult since these energy sources are intermittent in time and space. It is necessary to utilize electrochemical processes to store and convert renewable energy.1–4 Electrocatalysis is an essential technology during the energy conversion and storage process, which includes the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), carbon fuel oxidation reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). However, the large scale application of electrocatalysis is constrained by the lack of suitable catalysts.5,6 Ideal catalysts should meet the demand of high activity, long durability, and low price.
In the past decade, great efforts have been devoted to developing electrocatalysts with high activity, excellent stability, and long working life. There are four factors which should be considered to improve the performance of electrocatalysts: first, the composition of the electrocatalyst. According to the literature, the catalysts which are formed by two or more kinds of metals usually show better electrocatalytic activity due to the electronic interaction and synergistic effect between two components.7 Second, the nanostructure and size should be considered. A designed nanostructure and suitable size could increase the density of accessible active centers.2 Third, the surface structure of the electrocatalyst should be considered. Since the electrocatalytic reaction happens on the surface of the catalyst, designing the surface of the material could engineer the construction of surface active centers, and improve the intrinsic activity of the electrocatalyst.8 Finally, the support of the catalyst should be carefully designed and selected. The support could improve the catalytic efficiency of active components per unit area. Meanwhile, a high porosity and high surface area promote the uniform dispersion of the catalysts.9
Interfacial effects mean that the catalyst can exhibit unique properties caused by the formation of the interface of two different components, which is usually effective in improving the electrocatalytic properties by adjusting the catalyst electronic structure, stabilizing active catalysts, accelerating electron transfer, and enabling different adsorption properties towards various reaction intermediates. As early as 1978, Tauster et al. demonstrated the classic concept of strong metal–support interactions (SMSIs) in thermal catalysis.10 Interactions with a TiO2 support surface dramatically altered the physical and chemical properties of noble metal catalysts. Along with the more profound understanding of SMSIs, various support–catalysts pairs with interfacial interactions have been developed.11,12 Later, the concept of electronic metal support interaction (EMSI) was proposed by Campbell.13 Moreover, during the 1980s, several reports indicated that when noble metals (Pt and Ru) are supported on reducible oxides (WO3 and TiO2), such a two-component system displays specific behavior in electrocatalysis prompting researchers to study SMSIs in the field of electrocatalysis.14–17 Recently, with the development of advanced characterization approaches, many studies have further demonstrated the origins of the interfacial effect.18–21 For example, Rozière and co-workers demonstrated that Pt/doped SnO2 interface sites can enhance the ORR electrocatalytic properties due to the SMSI which are considered to result from the charge transfer from SnO2 to Pt.19 The electronic structure of interfacial Pt atoms was adjusted, and this modified how catalysts interact with intermediates. This interfacial interaction, which is the most common interfacial effect, has attracted much attention from researchers in the field of electrocatalysis. There remains a large space for research.
Currently, different from thermal catalysis, carbon materials are widely employed to support catalysts for various electrocatalytic reactions due to their high surface area, porous structure, and high electrical conductivity compare to oxides.22,23 The interfacial effects between carbon materials and metal-free catalysts have also been reported.24 The interfacial charge transfer induced by the electronic interaction between a black phosphorus catalyst and a N-doped graphene support can regulate the electronic structure of the catalyst and the support and remarkably alter their affinity to reaction intermediates. However, the interface of carbon supported catalysts may be unstable because the carbon support would be corroded during long-term electrocatalysis. As a result, the porous structure could be damaged and the catalyst will fall off and aggregate, and the catalytic activity will decrease. Thus, improving the corrosion resistance of the support is one of the efficient ways to strengthen the stability of the interface. A specific structure, such as the one dimensional porous framework in carbon nanotubes and mesoporous carbon, could prevent carbon supports from the attack from oxygen-contain species. Besides, modification and doping would enhance the interaction between supports and catalysts, thus improving the stability of electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, metal oxides can also serve as supports for active nanoparticles and have been proposed as alternative supports of carbon based materials, since they are stable in an oxidizing environment and offer a more hydrophilic environment at the three-phase boundary.9 For instance, it was found that the chemical properties of Pt remarkably changed after loading on a Co3O4 support since the interfacial effects between the Pt nanoparticles and Co3O4 support not only induce the partial oxidation of Pt nanoparticles but also activate the support.25 Besides, reducible supports, such as WO3, SnO2, CeO2, NbO2, and TiO2, are eye-catching materials, since the charge transfer and reverse spillover of oxygen at the interface of supports and catalysts would contribute their catalytic performance.26–28 Moreover, several strategies have been developed to promote the formation of interfacial effects which are summarized in part 2.
Despite rapidly developing studies of interfacial effects in the field of electrocatalysis, the understanding of it remains at an early stage. Recently, few reviews have focused on the impact of the interface between catalysts and support on the electrocatalytic properties. For instance, Guo et al. discussed the progress in enhancing electrocatalysis for renewable energy technologies depending on the surface and interface engineering of metal nanocrystals.29 Feng et al. also summarized the support and interfacial effects in water-splitting electrocatalysis.30 Huang et al. discussed the opportunities and challenges of interface engineering in bimetallic nanostructures for the HER, OER, ORR and CO2RR.31 However, these reviews mainly focus on the interfacial effects for limited electrocatalytic reactions or specifically supported catalysts, while other subjects in this field, such as metal-free supported catalysts, the NRR, and other electrocatalytic reactions, are not referred in previous reviews. Thus, a timely review is required to provide a comprehensive summary of interfacial effects in support materials in the field of electrocatalysis.
To offer an overview for supported catalysts and further promote the development of interfacial effects in electrocatalysis, we summarize supported catalysts for the HER, ORR, CO2RR, OER and NRR and carbon fuel oxidation reactions and try to understand the relationship between the interfacial structure and electrocatalytic properties. The understanding of interfacial effects in these electrocatalysts for improving the electrocatalytic properties will also be summarized, as shown in Fig. 1. In this review, we start with summarizing the rational selection, synthesis of supported catalysts, and strategies to improve the support. Then, recent improvements in these vital electrocatalytic reactions are discussed, respectively. Finally, the challenges and prospects are presented for this promising field.

2. Strategies to improve the formation of interfacial effects
2.1 Rational selection and synthesis of supported catalysts
In electrocatalytic reactions, the characteristics of electrode materials play a significant role in the electrocatalytic properties. These characteristics, such as size, composition, and structural features, can be tailored by various strategies, including heteroatom doping,36 nanostructuring,2 interfacial structuring,37etc. Of particular note is that the rational design and delicate regulation of the interfacial structure can increase not only the number of active sites (e.g., exposing more active sites on supports) but also increase the intrinsic activity of each site (e.g. regulating the electronic structure).38 Besides, it is well established that the support enables the stability of catalysts. Therefore, designing and exploiting efficiently supported catalysts have great significance in pushing the development of electrocatalysis.
Since many reviews summarized synthesis methods to construct supported catalyst materials,39,40 we only introduce a few novel strategies to synthesize supported catalyst materials here. Generally, a wide range of methods can be employed to synthesise supported catalysts materials, such as wet impregnation, atomic layer deposition (ALD), electrochemical deposition, solution-based synthesis, pyrolysis, and physical sputtering. ALD is one variant of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in which catalysts are deposited on substrate surfaces by a series of self-limiting reactions. Therefore, it becomes an efficient way to control the structure and composition of catalyst–support pairs on the nanoscale precisely, which can promote the understanding of the interfacial structure–activity relationships. Direct pyrolysis carbonization of N-containing organic ligands is one of the most common methods to synthesize supported catalysts. During the pyrolysis process, the decomposition of organic ligands can generate N-doped porous carbon and metal catalyst and the relationship of metal particles and the support is not just “geometric” which means that the support can prevent the metal from aggregation due to its porous structure. Mostly there is a chemical interaction between the support and catalyst, which leads to electronic perturbation at the interface and interfacial effects.
It is exceedingly important to choose proper catalyst–support pairs for a precise reaction. The affinity of the catalyst to reaction intermediates is the main factor worth considering.41 Many reports have systematically studied the descriptor of different reactions on various comprehensive materials by theoretical calculation.42,43 When the descriptor of the intermediate adsorption free energy is plotted as a function of the experimentally measured activity of different materials, a volcano shaped form is found.44,45 Recently, Jaramillo and colleagues summarized the mechanism and volcano plot of various electrocatalytic reactions.46 This will help researchers to choose suitable catalyst–support pairs for the electrocatalytic reaction. Most electrocatalytic reaction processes with multiple electron transfer steps occurred along with the generation of reaction intermediates. It requires researchers to choose a catalyst–support pair that can optimize the adsorption energy for different intermediates respectively. Also, then a bifunctional adsorption effect related to the different adsorption of various intermediates may be generated. So choosing the right catalyst–support pair guided by theoretical calculations will facilitate the investigation of interfacial effects. Besides, the selection of supports needs to be given a lot of attention. Supports that feature a suitable binding energy with reaction intermediates, high surface area, abundant sites for loading catalysts, and better stability are preferable choices. The electrochemical OER under acidic conditions is attractive but highly challenging. These selected supports should be insoluble in acidic solutions (e.g., IrO2) to investigate the interfacial effects for the OER.47,48 Mostly, the chemical properties of the support can be adjusted by several strategies which are summarized in the next section. These modified supports usually exhibit an unexpected interfacial interaction with the catalysts.
2.2 Heteroatom doped support
Heteroatom doping is a standard method for regulating the electronic structure and increasing the electrical conductivity of functional materials, especially carbon-based materials. Since the first report49 of N-doped CNTs for the ORR was published in 2009, the N doping strategy has been extended to other carbon-based materials, such as graphene and porous carbon materials. Moreover, the effect of nitrogen atom incorporation has been investigated for the OER, HER, and CO2RR.50 Nitrogen doping can efficiently improve the electrocatalytic activity of inert carbon materials due to the higher electronegativity of nitrogen than carbon and the effect of nitrogen lone pair electrons. The feature of nitrogen doping promoted its application to modify supports. A N-doped support can be prepared by either the pyrolysis of organics containing nitrogen34 or replacing other heteroatoms (e.g. O) in the support with N atoms.51 The theoretical calculation results indicated that the incorporation of N atoms would induce charge redistribution and will significantly change the adsorption energy and the adsorption mode of intermediates.49 It has also been pointed out that the incorporation of nitrogen atoms into carbon materials could adjust the position of the valence and conduction band of carbon materials, which would alter the work function and slightly open the band gap.52 As shown in Fig. 2A and B, an opened band gap would result in the formation of a charge layer between the N-doped materials and metal nanoparticles when N doped carbon-based materials were employed as the support for metal nanoparticles. Also, then the electron density of metal nanoparticles increased, resulting in high activity. Sometimes, a chemical bond, resulting from the interaction between N atoms and metal atoms, may form at the interface and would improve the dispersion of the metal nanoparticles and even achieve atomic distribution.53 Therefore, the stability and active sites are both increased, that is, the formation of interfacial effects. It is worth noting that other heteroatoms including P, S, B, and O have also been applied to dope functional materials for electrocatalysis.54,55 However, these heteroatom-doped supported catalysts have significantly limited literature. Considering this, heteroatom doping, an efficient interfacial effect development strategy, requires further research.

2.3 Defective support
Currently, defect engineering is an eye-catching strategy to improve the activity of the catalyst in both electrocatalysis and photocatalysis.56,57 The defects on the surface will generate abundant dangling bonds and unsaturated coordination sites which could enhance the catalytic activity of materials. For example, Wang and co-workers have introduced multiple vacancies in CoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets (Fig. 2C).58 They proposed that the vacancies on the CoFe LDH surface enable the regulation of the electronic structure and decrease of coordination numbers, leading to excellent OER activity in alkaline media. Therefore, defective materials are suitable to serve as supports for catalysts. On the one hand, the defects on the surface of supports can act as active sites to improve catalytic properties and induce different interfacial adsorption of various intermediates. On the other hand, the defect sites with rich charge transfer charge from supports to catalysts and regulate the electronic structure of catalysts. Thus, defective supports usually favor the charge transfer at the interface, which would lead to the formation of interfacial effects. Moreover, several literature studies have proved that defect sites on the support could serve as anchor centers for the catalyst.33,59 Additionally, defect engineering can be achieved by various simple methods, such as plasma etching60 and doping.61 Thus defect engineering is a promising approach to promote the investigation of interfacial effects.
3. Application of interfacial effects in electrocatalysis
Electrocatalysis is vital to design a new type of sustainable energy storage and conversion system. Catalysts are primary factors that limit the commercial application of this promising technology. In general, an ideal catalyst should have the features more exposed active sites, excellent electrical conductivity, optimal reaction energy barrier, low cost and excellent durability.5,46 Structuring supported catalysts and creating interfacial effects can be used as efficient regulation strategies for various electrocatalytic reactions.
3.1 Interfacial effects for the HER
The HER, which is the cathode reaction of water-splitting devices, can efficiently produce high-purity and clean hydrogen from water. Electrochemical water splitting has become an attractive route to achieve renewable energy-to-hydrogen conversion because of its flexibility, sustainability, and applicability. So it is vital to prepare low-cost HER electrocatalysts with excellent properties for electrochemical water splitting devices. The HER process consists of H adsorption (Volmer reaction step), reduction and H2 desorption (Heyrovsky or Tafel step).62 Based on the Sabatier principle,45 the interaction between catalysts and adsorbed intermediates cannot be too strong or too weak.56 For the HER, Pt is located very near the top of the volcano.63 So, Pt or Pt-based materials are considered as state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for the HER. However, Pt is too expensive for broad application. The development of supported catalysts can not only utilize interfacial effects to boost the HER catalytic activity but also reduce and replace the usage of Pt.
Dispersing active materials (such as precious metals) on the support, which can prevent its agglomeration, is one of the most promising ways to increase the utilization of noble metals. Markovic and colleagues33 demonstrated that the HER activity under alkaline conditions can be remarkably enhanced by tailoring the interface between Pt(111) and Ni(OH)2.35 As we knew, the HER rate in alkaline media is more sluggish than that in acidic media because the hydrogen in alkaline media is generated from water instead of hydrated protons (H2O–H+). The cleavage of the O–H bond in the former is much trickier than the latter. The introduction of Ni(OH)2 on the Pt(111) surface and the construction of the interface between them could improve the HER properties in alkaline media, since Ni(OH)2 is efficient for water dissociation and Pt is a suitable catalyst for hydrogen adsorption (H*) and conversion. So H2O molecules at the interface of Pt(111)–Ni(OH)2 hybrids could be converted into H2 quickly. They further prepared Ni(OH)2 on a range of metal supports to investigate the influence of different support–catalysts pairs on the HER activity.64 As illustrated in Fig. 3A, different supports had different promotion effects for the HER activity. Under alkaline conditions, the activity of all these metals increased with the introduction of Ni(OH)2 on their surface.

Moreover, different supports had different effects on improvements. Strikingly, the HER overpotential of a bare Cu surface in 0.1 M KOH is much lower than that of a bare Au surface, while a irreconcilable overpotential difference occurred with the introduction of Ni(OH)2. This demonstrated that the suitable matching of the catalyst and support could enhance the HER properties.
Recently, He et al. investigated the HER activity of a Pd/CeO2/C hybrid electrocatalyst in 1.0 M KOH solution.65 The XPS and XAS results showed that the close interface and strong interactions between Pd and CeO2 formed a unique Pd–O–Ce structure. The DFT calculation and electrochemical results showed that it could optimize the states of catalytic centers and lower the energy barriers of H2O molecules and H+ adsorption on the catalytic sites, giving a boosted HER catalytic performance. It is worth mentioning that the interface between metal oxides and carbon materials also existed. Also, it was proven that the chemical interactions between the metal oxide and carbon influence their electrocatalytic activities. Sun and co-workers designed Pt–Ni(HCO3)2 hybrids towards outstanding catalytic HER performance in an alkaline electrolyte.66 Ni(HCO3)2 provides abundant H2O adsorption/dissociation sites and modulates the electronic structure of Pt, both of which determine the elementary reaction kinetics of the alkaline HER. The XPS and XANES results evidence charge transfer from Pt to Ni(HCO3)2 and the strong electronic interaction between Pt and Ni(HCO3)2. The D-band center of Pt could serve as a descriptor for the intensity of surface atom adsorption interactions.67 Thus, this interaction regulated the electronic structure of Pt, optimized the adsorption strength of H intermediates on the Pt surface, and facilitated the HER activity in alkaline media.
Employing the electronic interactions of catalyst–support pairs to adjust the electronic structure is also demonstrated in non-precious metal electrocatalysts. For example, Bao and colleagues also reported the interfacial effects between metals and carbon materials.69 They found that the interfacial charge, which transferred from the CoNi core to the graphene surface, could enhance the HER activity in an acid electrolyte. Later, Song and colleagues demonstrated that the accessible and high-density interface structures, the optimal metal/oxide ratio, and the intimately contacted carbon network facilitate the catalytic process and accelerate HER kinetics.68 In this work, a unique ternary interface between Ni, NiO and carbon layers was created by the simple pyrolysis method (Fig. 3B). HRTEM, XAS, and electrochemical methods were applied to investigate the relationship between this unique ternary interfacial structure and HER activity. The existence of interfacial interactions between Ni species and carbon layers was verified by C K-edge XAS characterization, as shown in Fig. 3C. It was further proposed that the interaction of Ni and NiO benefited water dissociation, and was the rate determining step. Meanwhile, the interface between NiO and carbon layers could accelerate the transfer rate of electrons, preventing the formation of excessive inactive NiO species, and create abundant active sites at the Ni–NiO interface. As shown in Fig. 3D and E, Ni/NiO@C-2 catalysts exhibited outstanding HER properties which were even close to those of Pt/C.
Besides, the phenomenon of enhanced catalytic activity by interfacial effects was observed in N-doped carbon encapsulated cobalt–cobalt oxide hybrids (CoOx@CN).34 The introduction of heteroatoms, such as N, B, P, etc., into carbon materials could prompt the charge redistribution of carbon atoms, owing to the different sizes and electronegativity of heteroatoms and carbon atoms. This charge redistribution will regulate the electronic structure and other properties of carbon materials. So the features of the interface formed with N-doped carbon are different from the one created with pristine carbon. Both HER and OER catalytic activities of CoOx@CN are better than those of carbon encapsulated cobalt–cobalt oxide hybrids (CoOx@C). This improvement of electrocatalytic activity was attributed to the increase of metallic Co reduced from Co2+ caused by the electron-donating effect of nitrogen. This indicated that charge transfer at the interface could remarkably increase the number of active sites. However, the authors have not focused on whether the coordinated Co–N–C bond may be generated due to the interaction between metallic Co and defective sites in N-doped carbon. Other references demonstrated that transition metals like Co or Fe with N-containing organic ligands can easily generate metal–nitrogen–carbon bonds after pyrolysis in an inert atmosphere.70,71 This kind of interfacial interaction can adjust the electronic Fermi level to optimize the binding energy with reaction intermediates and alter the electrocatalytic properties. Constructing an interface by a one-pot pyrolysis method is an easy way to obtain a ternary interface of metals, metal oxides, and carbon materials.
Recently, Hou et al. reported boosted HER catalytic activity in an alkaline electrolyte due to the interfacial effect of N-doped carbon layers and oxygen-vacancy-rich tungsten oxynitride (Vo-WON).72 They proposed that the interfacial charges transferred from Vo-WON to the carbon layers, leading to the enhancement of the transfer of H* intermediates to H2 and the HER kinetics in 1 M KOH. The Tafel slope of the Vo-WON@N-doped carbon electrode is 33 mV dec−1. Thus, the authors conclude that the rate determining step for Vo-WON@N-doped carbon was the Tafel step. There was a high number of oxygen vacancies which can cleavage the OH–H bond, and water dissociation is the rate determining step. Therefore, the interfacial charge transfer could efficiently stabilize the H* intermediates and enhance the HER properties. The vacancies in tungsten oxynitride adsorb H2O and boost its dissociation which demonstrates the importance of the introduction of defects into the support to improve the formation of interfacial effects. Moreover, this study indicated that the properties of the interface are altered a lot due to the interfacial effects.
Recently, Mai et al. fabricated MoO2 supported Ni for the HER (Fig. 4A and B). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements indicated that Ni/MoO2 has a smaller work function (5.28 eV) compared to MoO2 (5.87 eV), which is attributed to the higher Fermi level energy caused by the charge transfer from Ni to MoO2 (Fig. 4E).73 It could benefit the adsorption of hydrogen and improve HER kinetics. Theoretical analyses verified that the projected density of states of MoO2 and Ni/MoO2 surfaces further indicated that the p orbital of oxygen atoms was raised and the electronic structure of MoO2 was adjusted after the introduction of Ni; thus the interaction of hydrogen and oxygen in MoO2 was enhanced and led to stronger hydrogen adsorption (Fig. 4C and D). Based on the consideration that the adsorption of hydrogen on the MoO2 surface was weak, the increased hydrogen–oxygen interaction in MoO2 accelerated the HER rate (Fig. 4F and G).

Wang and colleagues investigated the strong metal–phosphide interfacial interaction in acidic media.74 The electronic interaction between Fe and FeP regulated the electronic structure of FeP, increased the adsorption of hydrogen, and optimized the binding strength with hydrogen adatoms.
The HER, with its simple mechanism, can serve as a model reaction to investigate the structure–activity relationship of electrocatalysts. As summarized in Table 1, various support–catalyst pairs have been chosen to study the interfacial effects in electrocatalysis and obtain a deeper understanding of this effect through the combination of characterization technologies and DFT simulations. In alkaline media, the HER kinetics suffers from the water dissociation step. Even though supports are mostly inert for catalysis, the hydrophilic surface of oxide and hydroxide supports can remarkably improve this sluggish step and promote the dissociation and conversion of water on catalysts while the electronic structure adjusted by the interfacial interaction is capable of regulating the hydrogen intermediate binding energy and increasing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Thus, these representative examples show that the interface structure has a great effect on the electrocatalytic activity. This highlights the significance of further studying the interfacial effects for the HER especially under alkaline conditions.

3.2 Interfacial effects for the ORR
The cathodic ORR is very important for various promising sustainable energy conversion and storage devices, such as fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Therefore, it is essential to develop electrocatalysts with low cost, high tolerance to methanol crossover, high catalytic activity, and long stability. Mainly, the ORR process in an aqueous electrolyte involves the cleavage of OO double bonds and the formation of oxygen-containing intermediates including O*, OH*, and OOH*.75 Generally speaking, the ORR can proceed through either a two electron pathway or four electron pathway.22 The reaction rate of the ORR is limited by the adsorption energy of oxygen-containing intermediates and the energy barriers of one intermediate transforming into another one. Based on the mechanism, noble metal electrocatalysts show superior ORR catalytic activities in both basic and acidic electrolytes.7 However, they suffer from high price and poor stability. In the past few years, large numbers of supported catalysts have exhibited promising ORR activity, and the understanding of the relationship between the structure and activity has been developed.
Mukerjee and co-workers systematically explored metal and metal oxide interactions, using a Pt/NbOx/C electrocatalyst as the model in the ORR.76 The experimental evidence indicated that interfacial Pt–O interactions were formed, and Pt further interacted with Nb at the interface between the Pt cluster and unsaturated NbOx when the oxygen atoms permeate into the platinum cluster, as shown in Fig. 5A. The strong metal and metal oxide electronic interaction induced by the charge transfer from Pt to NbOx regulates the electronic structure of Pt and improves the catalytic properties for the ORR. This work showed that the electronic modification of the catalyst and support interactions, which is widely studied in thermal catalysis, could also affect the ORR catalytic performance.

The metal–support interactions at the interface can improve the catalysis activity by tuning the chemical and electronic properties of the catalyst. However, similar to thermal catalysis, SMSIs will sometimes lead to the degradation or even suppression of the electrocatalytic activity.10 Strasser et al. found the degradation of ORR catalytic activity in an electrocatalyst of Pt dispersed on ruthenium titanium mixed oxide (RTO) during electrochemical accelerated stress tests.77 With the help of various in situ techniques, the authors eliminated the possibilities, such as Pt agglomeration, dissolution, or detachment, for the reduction of the ORR activity in 0.1 M HClO4 solution. They attributed the reason for the gradual growth and final encapsulation of a thin RTO layer on the Pt nanoparticles to SMSIs (Fig. 5B). The authors claimed that the formation of thin RTO layers was partially irreversible because the ORR activity of the electrocatalyst cannot fully recover after chronoamperometric reduction and oxidation. The inert oxidized coating on catalysts prevents active sites from coming into contact with the reactant. In this work, oxide supports only play a role in dispersion and the interface between the support and Pt nanoparticles has no electrocatalytic activity. Thus, choosing an ideal support which can form an active interface with the catalyst is essential. Density functional theory (DFT) will be an effective method to solve this issue.
Recently, DFT results were used to predict the interfacial interactions between gold nanoparticles and a SnOx support.78 This simulation result was also proven experimentally. At the beginning, the interaction between the catalysts and support was prevented by the introduction of dendrimers at the interface. The catalyst can come into contact with the support after clearing the dendrimers (Fig. 5C). This ingenious strategy was employed to investigate the effects of the interface between gold nanoparticles and the SnOx support in the ORR (Fig. 5D). The interaction between noble metal catalysts and metal oxide supports is widely found in electrocatalysis, which excited researchers to further study this phenomenon by combining DFT calculations and experimental methods.
As we know, compared to thermal catalysis which only involves two phases (gas and solid), electrocatalysis is more complicated because of the introduction of a third phase (liquid). Besides, the interactions form at the interface between catalysts and supports, and thus, it becomes more challenging to study the cooperation mechanism of catalysts and supports in electrocatalysis systems. Using a core/shell structure of Co2P/Pt as a model catalyst,79 the DFT calculation results demonstrated that the formation of the Co2P(001)/Pt(111) interface immensely optimized Pt energies to the ORR while the Co2P(010)/Pt(111) interface is harmful to ORR catalysis. The enhanced catalytic activity by the interfacial effects was also proven experimentally. The activity of CoPt alloys and Pt nanoparticles without interfaces between Co2P and Pt is lower than that of Co2P/Pt nanorods in an acidic electrolyte. The authors proposed that the interfacial effects achieved an ideal Pt–O binding energy.
Transition metals and their oxides are demonstrated as promising electrocatalysts to replace noble metals.80 In 2011, Dai et al. developed Co3O4–graphene hybrids for the ORR in alkaline media.81 The authors found covalent Co–O–C and Co–N–C bonds generated in graphene supported Co3O4 hybrids, leading to good ORR electrochemical properties. Furthermore, defect engineering is an attractive approach to regulate the surface properties of materials and enhance the electrocatalytic activity for various reactions. Recently, Chen and co-workers prepared ultrafine Co nanoparticle catalysts supported on oxygen vacancy-rich and 3D ordered macroporous titanium oxynitride (3DOM-Co@TiOxNy).82 The authors demonstrated that Vo sites improved the conductivity and the Vo at the interface played a crucial role in stabilizing ultrafine metals. The interaction between the support and catalyst in 3DOM-Co@TiOxNy improved the ORR properties with a high halfwave potential (0.84 V), which is comparable to that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst (0.85 V) in a 0.1 M KOH solution. Also, this electrocatalyst exhibited outstanding stability in zinc–air batteries. This work indicated that defect engineering has great potential to develop interfacial effects in supported catalysts.
Combined with results from DFT simulations, the crucial role of interfacial effects on ORR activity has been proven through several experimental strategies (Table 2). Noble metal–support pairs, especially Pt–support pairs, were the primarily functional materials studied to understand interfacial effects. The interaction between catalysts and supports greatly influences the binding energy of catalysts with oxygen intermediates which tunes the ORR activity. However, if the interfacial effects never exist in the selected catalyst–support pairs, the inert support may cause the degradation of electrocatalytic properties. Also noteworthy is that H2O2 which is the two electron pathway product of the ORR is a valuable chemical, and increasing the yield of this product through interfacial effects is promising.

3.3 Interfacial effects for the CO2RR
A large amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) was discharged into the environment due to the abundant use of fossil fuels. Even though CO2 is not poisonous, it is considered as a greenhouse gas which causes global climate change. To resolve this issue, numerous studies have been carried out to reduce the usage of fossil fuels.83–85 Meanwhile, the conversion of CO2 into valuable chemical feedstocks is a promising way to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.86–88 However, the CO2 molecule is highly stable and challenging to convert. When a suitable cathodic reduction potential is provided, CO2 can be activated and converted into CO or another organic chemicals, such as methanol, formic acid, and even C2 hydrocarbons.89 The electrochemical CO2RR is kinetically sluggish and involves multiple electron transfer steps, which demands a high overpotential to activate the CO2 molecule and often results in a low faradaic efficiency.90 Therefore, efficient electrocatalysts are essential to boost the CO2RR kinetics and increase the selectivity of reduction products.
Over the past few decades, a wide range of electrocatalysts have been investigated for the CO2RR, and the reduction products are closely related to the catalyst design.91 Great efforts have been made to prepare suitable catalyst–support pairs for the CO2RR. Kim et al. demonstrated that the interfacial effects of Au/TiC enhanced the activity and selectivity for electroreduction of CO2 to CO.92 As shown in Fig. 6A, electron perturbation in Au–TiC at the interface was proven by XPS and DFT calculations. Based on the simulation result, when the sp electrons are transferred to the Au site, the adsorbate was found to move further away from the substrate, which could increase the adsorption strength of intermediates and represent a benefit for the conversion of CO2 to CO. Furthermore, this electronic interaction is related to the surface environment. As shown in Fig. 6B, there was an ideal interface coverage, which could achieve the maximum electronic interaction. Similarly, the CO2RR process boosted by interfacial charge transfer is also observed on C3N4 supported Au particles.93 The C atoms connected with N atoms show a unique chemical activity since the N atom possesses unpaired lone electrons. Confirmed from XPS and XANES measurements, the Au surface in Au/C3N4 has a large number of electrons donated from N atoms of the C3N4 support and this leads to a negatively charged Au surface, which could stabilize the *COOH intermediates and improve the CO2RR performance. DFT calculations demonstrated the boosted mechanism. Additionally, Bao et al. demonstrated that the interface between Au and CeOx played critical roles in enhancing the adsorption and activation of CO2 and enhanced the electrochemical CO2RR properties, as illustrated by the HRTEM image and the in situ vacuum scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) image (Fig. 6C and E).94 CO2 was preferentially adsorbed at interfacial boundaries between the CeOx island and the Au(111) surface. Therefore, the CO FE (Fig. 6D) and CO2 reduction activity (Fig. 6F) of Au–CeOx/C are higher than those of Au/C with the absence of these interfacial boundaries. The DFT simulations demonstrated that the critical intermediate to produce CO, which is *COOH, was stabilized by Ce3+ sites; thus the CO faradaic efficiency (FE) of this electrocatalyst was up to 89.1%. Zheng and co-workers also investigated the chemical bond at the interface.95 Moreover, they demonstrated that the Pd–O–Sn bond at the interface of Pd/SnO2 shows priority in reducing CO2 to CH3OH by assisting the further reduction of CO*intermediates. Also, Zheng's group has reported a series of systemic studies to understand the interfacial effects of heterogeneous catalysis.96–98

Besides, many researchers investigated the influence of interfacial effects between non-noble metals and supports on the CO2RR performance. For example, composition-dependent influences of metal/oxide interactions on the CO2RR were studied using Cu/SnOx heterostructured nanoparticles supported on CNTs as a model catalyst system.99 The Sn and Cu ratio regulated the catalytic behaviour of catalysts. In the Cu-rich regime, the Cu/SnOx–CNT catalyst can reduce CO2 to CO with a high FE of 89%. However, in the Sn-rich regime, the main products were methane and ethylene. When the content of SnOx reached 30.2%, the main product is formic acid with an FE of 77%. This unusual tunable catalytic selectivity could be attributed to the interfacial effects between Cu and SnOx. Later, Li and colleagues also demonstrated that the electronic interaction and different adsorption of various intermediates between lattice compression and Cu doping in an In2O3 shell might regulate the binding energy of different intermediates in the CO2RR, leading to the enhanced CO generation compared to Cu and In2O3 catalysts.100
Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with high utilization and high activity have attracted more and more researchers, and the reports of SACs for the CO2RR is continuously increasing.59 In general, metal catalysts attend to nuclear and grow to large size particles. Even though supports are capable of enhancing the nanoscale dispersion of the loaded metal catalysts, the preparation of SACs on suitable supports remains challenging. Recently, Zheng et al. prepared single-atomically dispersed Cu on a CeO2 support and utilized the interfacial interaction between Cu and CeO2.101 The single-atomic Cu substitution and multiple oxygen vacancies in CeO2 enhanced the selectivity of reducing CO2 to CH4, and achieved a high FE of 58%. Recently, Xie et al. successfully fabricated single-atom Snδ+ anchored on N-doped graphene.35 The atomically dispersed Sn atoms on N-doped graphene were positively charged (Snδ+) because of the strong bonding interactions between Sn atoms and N atoms in the supports (Fig. 7A), which was demonstrated by XANES and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). Moreover, in situ FT-IR and Gibbs free energy calculations affirmed that the positively charged Sn atoms are beneficial to stabilize the intermediates HCOO−* and CO2˙−* and hence exhibit a turnover frequency (TOF) of up to 11930 h−1 for formic acid production. Besides, the durable CO2RR properties indicate that this kind of interfacial bond could enhance the stability of catalysts, as illustrated as Fig. 7B. These studies inspire researchers to develop the utilization of interfacial effects in SACs for the CO2RR due to substantial active sites and high selectivity for a particular product. The lone pair electrons of nitrogen in N-doped graphene interact with metallic Sn and lead to atomic dispersion due to the formation of a coordination structure.

Besides, an enzyme (formate dehydrogenase, FDH) and metal oxide (TiO2) couple was proven as an efficient CO2RR catalyst (Fig. 7C).102 The result of quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy indicated that the electrostatic interaction of FDH–TiO2 enabled the stability of the interface between FDH and TiO2 and the CO2RR properties. This investigation of the enzyme–material interface provides new insight into novel catalyst–support pairs for electrocatalysis.
The CO2RR is a very complex process due to the multi-electron transfer steps and various intermediates involved. Thus, as shown in Table 3, multiple products were generated over different support–catalyst pairs. The catalysts modified by interfacial effects exhibited different affinities to intermediates in the CO2 electroreduction process. So, it is a promising pathway to tune the selectivity of CO2RR products through interfacial effects. Photosynthesis is a natural CO2RR and provides some design strategies for the development of novel support–catalyst pairs. Considering the complex mechanism of CO2 reduction, the research of interfacial effects in CO2 electrocatalysis still has a long way to go.

3.4 Interfacial effects for the OER
The OER is an essential reaction for water splitting and metal–air batteries.103 However, the commercial application of these energy conversion devices suffers from the sluggish kinetics of the OER. Highly active and stable catalysts are required. As we know, the number of active sites in electrocatalysts plays a crucial role in decreasing the overpotential for the OER. Supports are often used to disperse active catalysts and enhance their stability. Moreover, supports were found to induce electronic interaction effects and create new active sites to reduce the reaction barrier.
For example, Jaramillo and co-workers investigated MnOx/Au electrocatalysts systematically and demonstrated that the enhanced OER catalytic activity is not only attributed to the improved surface area, but also changes of MnOx and Au red-ox properties.104In situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) characterization, which can be used to obtain the electronic structure of the entire electrocatalyst, was performed and the XANES spectra of MnOx and MnOx/Au have no measurable difference, indicating that the bulk phase has little influence on improving the OER properties. The comparison of Mn L-edge XAS spectra between MnO/Au and MnO suggests that an interfacial effect between MnOx and Au exists. Also, this interfacial structure of Au supported cobalt oxides for the OER was further studied by Lauritsen and colleagues.105 An ultra-high vacuum STM was used to record the change of the interface between cobalt oxide and Au at various applied potentials. It revealed that an active cobalt–oxyhydroxide species was generated at the interface between cobalt oxides and Au. However, the detailed mechanism by which the Au support promotes the formation of this active species is unclear.
Jaramillo et al. further investigated the interfacial effects between Au and CeO2-doped NiOx.106 In this work, an additional thin layer of gold was used to support NiCeOx (Ni:Ce ratio = 95:5), which leads to superior OER properties than those of the NiCeOx catalyst on bare glassy carbon. Theoretic simulations indicate that the introduction of the Au substrate enables the presence of specific active site geometries. As shown in Fig. 8A, by doping Ce into finite NiOx/Au, the Ni edge site at the interface of the support and catalyst possesses a near-optimum OER descriptor, which represents an appropriate energy of OER intermediates. This doping engineering adjusted the chemical properties of the catalyst and promoted different adsorption of various intermediates (Fig. 8B). Takanabe et al. reported that CeOx layers were deposited on NiFeOx/Au and formed a stable interface between CeOx and NiFeOx.107 The CeOx layer exhibits unique permselectivity which allows the penetration of OH− and O2 and prevents the diffusion of redox ions (Fig. 8C), ensuring the high stability of NiFeOx/Au (Fig. 8D). This novel strategy of constructing a stable and selective interface for active sites is a promising method to design durable and highly active electrocatalysts.

Besides, researchers have studied the interfacial effects of core–shell structures on OER performance.108,109 For these Au@metal oxide electrocatalysts, it was demonstrated that the Au cores could enhance the OER properties compared to non-Au containing counterparts.108 In the FeOx system, the improvement of OER properties can be attributed to the formation of a conductive interface. A noble core–shell iridium–iridium oxide has also been investigated for the OER.109 The low resistance electronic transport pathway which forms at the interface between the metallic core and resistive oxide shell can improve the sluggish kinetics of the OER in a 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte. Moreover, Li and co-workers prepared a NiCo/Fe3O4/MOF-74 electrocatalyst by a controlled pyrolysis strategy for the OER in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte.110 The unique structure of the NiCo alloy core and Fe3O4 thin shell boosted the OER performance because of the interaction between the core and shell. The DFT calculations and experimental results demonstrated that the encapsulated Fe3O4 is essential to this electrocatalyst since the NiCo core offers the same spin pool that couples with the Fe site and stabilizes a high reactive species (O radical intermediate).
Beside noble metals, transition metal oxyhydroxide (MOOH, M = Fe, Co, and Ni) based materials are promising catalysts for electrocatalytic water oxidation because of their low cost, high intrinsic activity and large surface area. Nevertheless, the application of MOOH often suffers from poor mass-transfer ability and few numbers of active sites. In 2016, FeOOH/CeO2 heterolayer nanotube electrocatalysts were designed and synthesized for the OER.111 They show outstanding electrocatalytic performance owing to the electronic interaction at the interface of FeOOH and CeO2 and the oxygen storage capacitance ability of CeO2. Later, Greeley et al. prepared ultrathin (hydroxy)oxide films on transition metal substrates.112 Using DFT calculations and electrochemical surface science technologies, it was proved that the interfacial effects between oxyhydroxides and supports can serve as a potential strategy to increase stability and catalytic activity for the OER. To study the effects of Au substrates on the OER activities of nickel-based oxyhydroxide catalysts, nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH), nickel-iron oxyhydroxide (NiFeOOH) and nickel-cerium oxyhydroxide (NiCeOOH) electrocatalysts were electrodeposited on gold and glassy carbon (GC) substrates, respectively.113 As expected, the OER properties of nickel-based oxyhydroxides on gold were better than those on GC substrates. NiCeOOH/Au also showed outstanding catalytic properties with an overpotential of 259 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M NaOH electrolyte. The superior electrocatalytic water oxidation activity of nickel-based oxyhydroxides on gold supports can be attributed to the stronger physical adhesion of catalysts on gold, better conductivity and more electrocatalytically active metal sites. Also, the interfacial effects of the CeO2 support in nickel hydroxide electrocatalysts have been studied.114 Compared to mixing Ni(OH)2 nanosheets with CeO2 mechanically, the as-synthesized Ni(OH)2–CeO2 hybrid exhibited a much lower overpotential, suggesting that the interfacial effects between Ni(OH)2 and CeO2 improved the OER activity. As shown in Fig. 8E, the valence state change of Ni3+ caused by the electron transfer at the interface can optimize the binding energy of intermediates during the OER process.
The OER process involves four electron transfer steps and a high reaction barrier. As illustrated in Table 4, catalysts for the OER are mostly transition metal oxides which have various valence states. In one hand, the charge transfer between oxide catalysts and metal supports may change the valence states of catalysts, tuning their catalytic properties. On the other hand, metal supports are an excellent electrical conductor and are able to accelerate reaction kinetics. However the stability of metal supports is an issue to solve. Also oxide supports can prevent the degradation of catalytic activity, so it is essential to develop oxide support–catalyst pairs for the OER.

3.5 Interfacial effects for other electrocatalytic reactions

3.5.1 Carbon fuel oxidation reaction. 
As well known, H2 is a clean and sustainable power source. However, considering the high cost and potential dangers of H2 containment and transport and the low energy density, it is essential to employ other liquid fuels to avoid these problems and promote the commercial application of fuels cells.115 In this review, the interfacial effects in the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) are summarized and discussed.
Currently, Pt is the most promising electrocatalyst for the MOR, which is the anode reaction of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs).116 However, the high cost and low tolerance to CO hindered the commercialization of DMFCs. Choosing the correct support for Pt can expose more active sites and reduce the usage of Pt. Moreover, the interfacial effects between Pt and the support would increase the intrinsic activity and CO tolerance of Pt. For example, Tao et al. employed ceria nanorods with rich Vo (Vo-CeO2) as a support for Pt particles (Fig. 9A).117,129 The interfacial charge transfer regulated the electronic structure of Pt, and thus the electronic density of Pt increased, which could reduce the chemisorption of CO on Pt surfaces. As illustrated in Fig. 9B, Vo-CeO2 can facilitate the adsorption of OH species, and the interfacial Pt atoms further oxidized the adsorbed CO. Therefore, the activity and stability of catalysts were enhanced (Fig. 9C and D). Also, Huang and co-workers have demonstrated different adsorption of various intermediates for the MOR.116 They designed a Pt/Ni(OH)2/rGO hybrid electrocatalyst and the rGO in this ternary hybrid provided a conductive interface to accelerate electron transfer. Also, the Ni(OH)2 support promoted the oxidation of CO at Pt surfaces owing to the optimal interactions between Ni(OH)2 and OH species. These results indicate that this kind of interfacial effect is a promising strategy to increase CO tolerance of Pt for the MOR. Besides, Zhang et al. prepared a catalyst of Pt supported on WO3 with rich Vo for the MOR.118 Vacancy sites on the WO3 surface acted as nucleation centers for the deposition of Pt. Both electronic and physical interactions of Pt and WO3 are modulated, and thus the activity and stability of MOR were enhanced. The active defect sites on the supports can trap reaction intermediates and catalysts which effectively promotes the interfacial effects and influences the electrocatalytic properties.

Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) are severely limited by sluggish kinetics and low tolerance of intermediates (e.g. CO and –CHO) on the electrocatalyst.119 To explore efficient electrocatalysts for the EOR, Hrbek and co-workers conducted systematic studies to reveal the interfacial effects of a SnOx/Pt(111) model electrocatalyst by XPS, low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy, and low energy electron diffraction.120 XPS data show a large amount of H2O/OH adsorbed on the reduced SnOx surface, which could be vital for the oxidative removal of COads toxic species at Pt sites and contribute to the high activity and durability of EOR activity. This interfacial bifunctional adsorption mechanism, different adsorption of various intermediates, is similar to the enhanced MOR activity as mentioned above. Additionally, Wang and co-workers observed the improved electrocatalytic activity for the EOR over Pd@N-doped carbon.121 XPS results indicated that the electron-donating effects of N facilitated the reduction of Pd2+ to metallic Pd. Electrochemical results showed that this charge transfer efficiently increased the intrinsic activity of Pd@CN towards the EOR. The mechanism of electron donation from N-doped materials to metals was also discussed above, which indicates that N doping is beneficial to create interfacial effects and increase active sites for electrocatalysis.34 Later, Feng and colleagues designed Pd/CeO2 hybrids for the EOR and demonstrated that the active sites of the EOR were the interface between Pd nanoparticles and the CeO2 support by CO stripping experimental results.122 Combining the XPS spectrum with the electrochemical results, they further claimed that the CeO2 support could also donate electrons to Pd, regulating the electronic structure of Pd, which finally resulted in excellent EOR properties. Currently, studies of interfacial effects in the MOR and EOR are mainly based on noble metal catalysts and oxide supports due to their high activity. However for sustainable development, non-precious metal catalysts need to be developed (Table 5).

3.5.2 Nitrogen reduction reaction. 
Ammonia (NH3) is not only used as a hydrogen storage material,123 but also serves as the feedstock of fertilizers to sustain the development of the global population.124 Currently, industrial NH3 production is dominated by the Haber–Bosch process which uses iron-based catalysts to convert N2 and H2 into NH3 at high temperature (300–500 °C) and high pressure (150–300 atm). This process accounts for ∼1% of the world's energy supply and releases more than 300 million metric tons of CO2 into the environment.125 The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) process is a promising approach to synthesise NH3 from N2 and water under mild conditions, which can serve as an alternative process for conventional NH3 production. However, the activation of N2 requires a high energy because the NN bond energy is up to 940.95 kJ mol−1.126 Also, most electrocatalysts generally tend to the HER which is a competing reaction with the NRR in electrocatalysis, resulting in a low FE of the NRR. Rationally choosing the catalyst–support pairs is an efficient way to improve the NRR activity and suppress the competition from the HER at the same time.
With the help of DFT computations, Zhao et al. investigated the potential of single-atom catalysts supported on a defective boron nitride monolayer with B monovacancies as NRR electrocatalysts.127 As shown in Fig. 10, three possible mechanisms are illustrated: distal (Fig. 10A), alternating (Fig. 10B) and enzymatic mechanisms (Fig. 10C). Based on the free energy of these three pathways, the computations revealed that atomic Mo/BN catalyzes the NRR through an enzymatic mechanism. The interfacial bond of Mo–N3 plays a role as anchors to support atomic Mo and stabilize this electrocatalyst. Besides, the charge transfer between atomic Mo and BN monolayers improved the interaction of adsorbed NxHy intermediates and catalysts. The results proved that the single Mo atom supported on the BN monolayer (atomic Mo/BN) is the only eligible one among these simulated model electrocatalysts since atomic Mo/BN can not only absorb and activate N2 but also has an appropriate interaction with the *N2H and NH2* intermediates. This result highlighted the importance of rationally choosing catalyst–support pairs for the NRR. Later, the computational conclusion was proven by experimental work. Han et al. demonstrated that atomic Mo supported on N-doped porous carbon exhibited NRR yield of 34 μgNH3 h−1 mgcat.−1 and a high FE of 14.6%.128 Moreover, Ru single atoms anchored on N-doped porous carbon for the electrochemical NRR was also reported by Robertson and colleagues.129 These studies will motivate more researchers to further understand the interfacial effects of SACs–support pairs in the NRR.

Besides single-atom catalysts, the interfacial effects between metals and metal oxides were also studied. Shi et al. demonstrated that the electrocatalytic NRR is possible under ambient conditions by using Au sub-nanoclusters on a TiO2 support.130 The chemical bonding between atomic Au and the lattice oxygen of TiO2 at the interface (Au–O–Ti bond) enabled the stability of the catalyst and promoted the interaction between Au and TiO2. Positively charged Au species were generated, which adsorbed N2 rather than the positively charged H+, and thus the HER was suppressed. The influence of interfacial effects on the NRR was also found in the metal of Fe and iron oxide supports. Feng and colleagues developed an Fe/Fe3O4 electrocatalyst for the NRR under ambient conditions.131 Compared with the Fe, Fe3O4, and Fe2O3 electrocatalysts, Fe/Fe3O4 showed outstanding NRR properties. Based on DFT calculations, the surface sites of Fe and Fe3O4 could bind *N2H strongly and bind *NH2 weakly, so that it could prevent the catalyst surface from poisoning by intermediates *NH2 and enhance the intrinsic NRR catalytic performance.
However, the study of the electrochemical NRR is limited by grand challenges, such as the controversial NRR mechanism, potentially polluting ammonia detection methods, and limited electrochemical methods. Therefore, there are few pieces of literature reporting catalyst–support pairs for the NRR. However, these studies mentioned above will attract more and more attention to design efficient catalyst–support pairs for the NRR and promote the development of the electrochemical NRR shortly (Table 5).

4. Conclusion and perspective
In this review, we summarize the recent progress in supported catalysts for promoting electrocatalysis relevant to renewable energy technologies. Supported catalysts contain an active catalyst firmly anchored on supports often exhibiting a bifunctional performance which means that the supported catalysts have much better catalytic capability than the catalyst or support. Also the method of constructing supported catalysts has a great influence on their performance towards electrocatalysis. Thus there are plentiful pieces of literature reporting the application of supported catalysts in the HER, ORR, CO2RR, OER, and so on. Even through substantial advances have been made in recent years in the electrocatalytic activities of supported catalysts, deep fundamental understanding is still lacking. Here, we propose the following research subjects to address this issue:
(i) Advanced in situ measurement techniques are required to characterize interfacial effects. Currently, various practical methods, such as TEM, STM, and XAS, are applied to describe the interface structure. However, considering the complexity of electrocatalysis, it is difficult to observe the evolution of the interface and trace the interaction process during the electrocatalytic reactions. In situ and operando technologies, which characterize the local and electronic structures of catalysts under operating conditions, are vital methods to solve this problem. It is reported that in situ STM can characterize the dissolution process of Pt which was anchored on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG).132 Meanwhile, electrochemical methods, for example, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, are desirable for characterizing the situation of an interface, such as interface resistance and electron transfer.
(ii) Figuring out the real origins of interfacial effects could guide researchers in rationally designing catalysts in the future. The strain effect, the formation of interfacial bonds and the generation of a conductive interface are often considered as the main factors to improve the electrocatalytic performance of supported catalysts. Indeed, different interfacial effects often emerge at the same time, and it is a challenge to disentangle the contributions of different interfacial effects. Besides, the nature of electrocatalytic reactions also increases the complexity of this challenge. For the same reaction, the interfacial effects on the electrocatalytic activity may be different due to the different reaction mechanisms when the reaction is conducted under different environmental conditions. Moreover, the mechanism of some electrocatalytic reactions remains controversial. A promising strategy to overcome this barrier is developing advanced methods to construct electrocatalysts with atomic-scale catalysts supported on a monolayer support with tunable properties. A homogeneous distribution of the well-defined interfacial sites will be created, and this allows the precise study of the interfacial effects. Tuning the features of the support can disentangle the relative importance of these interfacial effects. In another case, DFT calculation is also a useful method to investigate the impact from various kinds of interfacial effects.
(iii) With the help of interfacial effects, the exploitation of novel supported catalysts is promising. With the rapid development of materials science, a wide range of new materials has been developed for various electrocatalytic reactions. Traditional support materials, such as carbon and metal oxides, suffer from poor stabilities and low electrical conductivity. It is an urgent need to find a new type of support which could meet the requirement of industry with high activity and long-term stability. Moreover, modifying support materials, such as through doping or defect engineering, is another way to achieve this purpose.
In summary, with the interfacial effects, supported catalysts can generate new properties and unique functionalities. The interfacial effects can productively improve the electrocatalytic properties by adjusting the electronic structures of the catalysts via charge transfer, stabilizing catalysts via interfacial bonding, accelerating electron transfer via generating a conductive interface and enabling bifunctional adsorption through different adsorption properties of catalysts and supports towards various reaction intermediates. Thus, interfacial effects exhibit significant potential in the exploitation of advanced electrocatalysts for improving electrocatalysis properties. Although the development of interfacial effects is facing various challenges, we believe that with the rapid growth of materials science and characterization techniques, this field can make significant progress in fundamental studies and further realize commercial application in sustainable energy systems.
