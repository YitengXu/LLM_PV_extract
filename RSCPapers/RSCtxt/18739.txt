    , Accepted 1st May 2018First published on 2nd May 2018AbstractPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising method for the conversion and storage of solar energy. A combination of catalysts with photoelectrodes is generally required for the development of active photoanodes in PEC devices. In this work, we present two BiVO4 photoanodes modified with cobalt salophen (Co(salophen)) complexes for PEC water oxidation. The resulting photoanodes show significantly enhanced PEC performance. Under simulated sunlight illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), high photocurrents of 3.89 mA cm−2 and 4.27 mA cm−2 were obtained for Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4, respectively at 1.23 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) in a neutral solution, an almost three-fold enhancement over that of the unmodified BiVO4. Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) analysis shows that the Co(salophen) complexes not only accelerate the water oxidation reaction but also reduce the surface recombination. The half-cell solar energy conversion efficiencies for Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4 were 1.09% and 1.18% at 0.7 V, respectively. Due to their hydrophobic nature, the Co(salophen) complexes can bind strongly to the surface of BiVO4. When the Co2 complex featuring four hydrophobic tert-butyl groups in a salophen ligand was anchored to BiVO4, an extremely stable photocurrent of more than 3.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE is sustained for at least 3 h without decay. Such a stable and robust photoanode based on a molecular WOC surpasses those attained by most of the state-of-the-art heterogeneous catalysts.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting to generate hydrogen using sunlight offers an attractive route to achieve the conversion and storage of solar energy.1–3 In a PEC device, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the photoanode as the key half reaction is generally considered as the bottleneck, due to its multiple electron and proton processes which are thermodynamically demanding.4–6 Therefore, one of the barriers that need to be overcome prior to a widespread use of this technology is the development of stable and efficient photoanodes.7,8 BiVO4 has been considered a promising candidate due to its appropriate bandgap of 2.4 eV to harvest visible light, and has other merits including abundance, low cost, nontoxicity, and suitable valence band energy for water oxidation.9,10 However, the PEC performance of unmodified BiVO4 has been limited by its poor charge transport and sluggish water oxidation kinetics. An efficient way to overcome this problem is integrating BiVO4 electrodes with a water oxidation catalyst (WOC).11–17
Previous studies have revealed that the immobilisation of inorganic WOCs such as Co–Pi11,12 and FeOOH/NiOOH13 can improve the PEC performance of BiVO4. However, these heterogeneous WOCs on the electrode surface have been generally prepared through electrodeposition or photodeposition, and in this process the thickness of the catalyst film must be controlled carefully because of its significant influence on light absorption and charge transport.18,19 Apart from heterogeneous WOCs, molecular WOCs have recently attracted attention due to their high activity, structural tunability, and facility in mechanistic studies.20–23
However, there are relatively few reports on the combination of BiVO4 photoanodes with a molecular co-catalyst.24–26 In a recent study, Li and co-workers developed a hybrid photoanode by combining a BiVO4 film with a molecular co-cubane catalyst, which gives a high PEC performance.26 However in their work, an alkaline condition (pH 9) was required, which is not considered environmentally friendly. Therefore, a molecular catalyst-based photoanode with high activity and stability remains a prerequisite for efficient PEC water splitting under mild and environmentally friendly conditions. Given this, our research reports on two hybrid photoanodes, fabricated by introducing molecular Co(salophen) complexes onto a porous BiVO4 surface. Cobalt(II) salophen complexes are easily synthesised and have been well studied in many catalytic fields.27,28 Recently, a Co(salophen) complex was shown to be an effective water oxidation catalyst either in a homogeneous system or on the electrode surface.29–32
In this work, two Co(salophen) complexes (Scheme 1) were directly and physically adsorbed onto porous BiVO4 electrodes via hydrophobic interaction. Compared with conventional loading methods of molecular catalysts, this facile method avoids the high cost by using Nafion33–35 as the adhesive and the complicated synthetic process required in the introduction of a –PO3H2 or –COOH binding group.36–39 The hydrophobic properties of the Co(salophen) complex provide a strong binding interaction with the electrode surface rather than dissolving in the solution. The as prepared hybrid photoanodes exhibit excellent PEC activity and stability at neutral pH, which is even higher than those attained by most of the state-of-the-art heterogeneous catalysts. To the best of our knowledge, such a stable and robust hybrid photoanode, based on a molecular catalyst under neutral conditions, is yet to be reported.

Results and discussion
Characterisation of photoanodes
BiVO4 thin films on FTO-coated glass substrates were fabricated by a two-step procedure described previously by Choi and co-workers (see the Experimental section for details) and the X-ray diffraction peaks are essentially consistent with those reported previously (Fig. S1†).13 The assembled Co(salophen)/BiVO4 electrodes were facilely prepared by soaking the BiVO4 electrode in a solution of a Co(salophen) complex in acetonitrile at room temperature, and the as-prepared electrodes are referred to as Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4. Due to their hydrophobic nature, the Co(salophen) complexes are sufficiently stable when assembled on the surface of BiVO4. The static contact angle measurements (Fig. S2†) demonstrate that the hydrophobic nature of the electrodes is enhanced after the modification of Co(salophen) complexes (37.1° for Co1/BiVO4 and 47.3° for Co2/BiVO4).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the morphology of the as prepared electrodes. The bare BiVO4 film shows the appearance of a three-dimensional (3D) network, composed of multiple worm-like nanoparticles (Fig. 1a). This nanoporous structure guarantees the adsorption of the molecular catalyst. After the modification with Co(salophen) complexes, the electrodes are retained, and no aggregation or new features are observed (Fig. 1b and c). The elemental mapping images indicate that Co is uniformly dispersed on the surface of BiVO4 (Fig. 1d and e). The Co 2p spectra in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) show two characteristic peaks at 781 eV and 796 eV, which belong to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 spin-orbital of Co(II) in Co1 and Co2, respectively (Fig. S3†). Raman spectroscopy also confirms that cobalt complexes have been successfully modified on the surface of BiVO4 as the characteristic signals of cobalt complexes are observed completely (Fig. 2). According to the results of inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP), the amount of Co bound to Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4 was calculated to be 44.9 nmol cm−2 and 39.7 nmol cm−2, respectively. The difference in the catalyst loading amount is mainly due to steric hindrance, for which Co2 has a larger molecular volume than Co1. With this extent of loading, Co(salophen) complexes have no impact on the light absorption of the original electrode, as shown in the UV-vis spectra (Fig. S4†). This indicates that the molecular catalyst cannot block or reflect the relevant photons in the visible range, which is one of the greatest advantages of using a molecular catalyst over inorganic ones.

PEC performance
The PEC performance of the resulting photoanodes was measured in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7), using simulated sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2), in a standard three-electrode system with the sample photoanodes as the working electrodes, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. First, the electrocatalytic activities for water oxidation of the Co(salophen) complexes on the bare FTO substrate were investigated. The photocurrent–potential (J–V) curves determined by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) are shown in Fig. 3a. Both the complexes show catalytic activity for water oxidation with a similar onset potential of 1.85 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and all further potentials are reported against the RHE unless otherwise stated, which implies an overpotential of 620 mV for Co1 and Co2, respectively. Co2 exhibits higher electrocatalytic activity than Co1, but neither of them is highly efficient in electrocatalytic water oxidation, compared to other WOCs. However, under simulated sunlight illumination, the Co(salophen)-modified samples exhibit considerably enhanced photocurrents (Fig. 3b). High photocurrents of 3.89 mA cm−2 and 4.27 mA cm−2 are obtained for Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4, respectively, at an applied potential of 1.23 V, while for the bare BiVO4, the photocurrent at the same potential is only 1.48 mA cm−2. Moreover, compared to the bare BiVO4, the onset potential is cathodically shifted by more than 200 mV, and the potential at a photocurrent density of 1 mA cm−2 is cathodically shifted by 600 mV for Co(salophen)-modified BiVO4. The remarkable reduction in onset potential and increase in photocurrent demonstrate that Co(salophen) complexes act as efficient cocatalysts on the surface of photoanodes in PEC water splitting.

Based on the LSV results in Fig. 3b, the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) for Co1/BiVO4 was calculated, with a maximum value of 1.09% at 0.7 V. The maximum ABPE for Co2/BiVO4 was calculated to be 1.18% at 0.7 V, about an eight-fold enhancement over that of unmodified BiVO4 (Fig. S5†). Fig. S6† shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) on bare and Co(salophen)-modified BiVO4 photoanodes at different wavelengths measured under a bias potential of 1.23 V. With the increasing wavelength, the IPCE value of each sample remains steady until 460 nm after which it decreases, which is consistent with their light absorption. Co(salophen)-modified BiVO4 photoanodes show higher IPCE values than the bare BiVO4. At 430 nm, the IPCE values are around 86% and 89%, for Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4, respectively.
To explore the interface charge transport behaviour of the as-prepared photoelectrodes, the photocurrents were measured in the presence of sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) to eliminate the hole injection barrier (Fig. S7†). The photocurrent density arising from PEC water oxidation can be described as:JH2O = Jabs × ηsep × ηinj,where Jabs is the photocurrent density when the absorbed photons are completely converted into current, ηsep is the charge separation efficiency of the photogenerated holes that refer to the bulk recombination, and ηinj is the charge injection efficiency of the surface reaching holes into the electrolyte.11,13 With Na2SO3 as a hole scavenger, the surface recombination is eliminated, so ηinj = 1, and the photocurrent density can be described as:JNa2SO3 = Jabs × ηsep.
The bare BiVO4 generates a significantly enhanced photocurrent in the presence of Na2SO3 because of its negligible surface recombination. Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4 show similar photocurrents to the bare BiVO4. The relative charge separation efficiencies of Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4 to BiVO4 are shown in Fig. S8,† which are obtained by dividing JNa2SO3 of Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4 by JNa2SO3 of BiVO4. The approximate separation efficiencies for each photoanode indicate that the modification of Co(salophen) cannot alter the bulk recombination. The ηinj for each photoelectrode can be calculated by JNa2SO3/JH2O. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that Co(salophen)-modified BiVO4 (Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4) exhibit higher ηinj than the bare BiVO4 over the whole potential range. The ηinj at 1.23 V for Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4 can reach 89.3% and 92.4%, respectively, whereas that obtained by the bare BiVO4 is only 58.0%. These results confirm that Co(salophen) complexes can effectively restrain the surface recombination and promote hole injection into the electrolyte. But it is not known from this experiment whether the ηinj improvement stems from an absolute increase in surface charge transfer (the Co(salophen) complex works as an OER catalyst), an absolute decrease in surface recombination (the Co(salophen) complex works as a surface passivation cocatalyst), or both.

Surface kinetics by IMPS
To understand the real role of Co(salophen) complexes in the photoanodes, intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements were employed. This technique has been previously applied to study the charge transfer and surface recombination kinetics of photoanodes.40–44 Several recent reports on BiVO4 have shown that when Co–Pi was deposited on BiVO4, it passivates recombination centers rather than working as a water oxidation catalyst.44–46Fig. 5a shows typical IMPS responses of Co1/BiVO4, Co2/BiVO4 and bare BiVO4 in the complex plane. It can be seen that the IMPS response is expressed as a function of frequency. The frequency at the maximum imaginary part corresponds to the sum of the charge transfer (ktrans) and recombination (krec) rate constants (ktrans + krec = 2πfmax). The low frequency intercept in the normalized form, at which the imaginary part equals 0 (Im(jphoto/jh) = 0), corresponds to the charge transfer efficiency (ktrans/(ktrans + krec)). Thus, the key parameters krec and ktrans at different applied bias potentials are readily obtained.40 The electron transfer time (τd) can be estimated from frequency at the minimum imaginary part (τd = 1/2πfmin).47

As shown in Fig. 5b, both Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4 exhibit higher values of ktrans compared to the bare BiVO4 over the entire potential range, indicating that both Co(salophen) complexes perform as OER catalysts on the surface of the photoanodes. The krec values for each photoanode are shown in Fig. 5c. Lower values of krec are observed for both Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4. Additionally, Co2/BiVO4 exhibits a slight increase in ktrans and decrease in krec compared to Co1/BiVO4, which is in accordance with its high photocurrent. These results demonstrate that Co(salophen) complexes not only accelerate the water oxidation reaction as OER catalysts, but also reduce the surface recombination, which is in contrast to the mere passivation action of Co–Pi as reported.
The charge transfer efficiencies, defined as ktrans/(ktrans + krec), are obtained (Fig. S9†). The enhanced values for Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4 are consistent with the ηinj as mentioned above. The transfer times of the photoanodes are shown in Fig. 5d. Each sample exhibits a decreasing τd with the increase of the bias potential. The electron transfer times of Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4 are much shorter (less than half) than that of the bare BiVO4, again supporting their superior charge transfer abilities.
Stability
The PEC stability of the photoelectrode is of great importance for a PEC device, especially for a molecular assembled device. In order to check the stability of the photoanodes during PEC water oxidation, a long-term photolysis at 1.23 V under visible-light irradiation was conducted (Fig. 6). The unmodified BiVO4 shows a low initial photocurrent density of no more than 1.48 mA cm−2 and then a rapid decline in photocurrent to less than 0.86 mA cm−2 within three hours. The decline in photocurrent caused by photocorrosion can be restrained by Co(salophen) complexes. Co1/BiVO4 shows a strong photocurrent followed by a slight decay. For Co2/BiVO4, a stable photocurrent of more than 3.5 mA cm−2 is sustained for at least 3 h without decay. Such stable PEC performance is very rare for molecular catalyst-based photoanodes, even surpassing those of most heterogeneous catalyst-based photoanodes.

The high PEC stability of Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4 is mainly attributed to the hydrophobic nature of the Co(salophen) complexes. To prove this point, PEC experiments were carried out after soaking the Co(salophen)-modified photoanodes in different solutions overnight. As shown in Fig. S10,† after the soaking treatment in water, the J–V curve is almost unchanged compared with the untreated one. After the soaking treatment in ethanol, the J–V curve exhibits a slight decrease, while after the soaking treatment in dichloromethane, the J–V curve decreases significantly, indicating a serious detachment of the Co(salophen) complex. Therefore, the hydrophobic nature of the Co(salophen) complexes enables them to be retained on the electrode rather than dissolving in water, which gives rise to a high PEC stability. Co2/BiVO4 exhibits a more stable photocurrent compared with Co1/BiVO4. The tert-butyl group in Co2 improves its hydrophobicity, so that it is more difficult to desorb from the electrode. This is evidenced by ICP measurements. After three hours of photoelectrolysis, the amount of Co on Co1/BiVO4 decreased by 43.4% (from 44.9 nmol cm−2 to 25.4 nmol cm−2), while that on Co2/BiVO4 decreased only by 8.3% (from 39.7 nmol cm−2 to 36.4 nmol cm−2). These results are indicative of a perfect combination of the catalysts and BiVO4.
In order to accurately assess the effect of the molecular Co(salophen) catalysts on actual oxygen production, the evolved O2 in headspace was quantified by gas chromatography. With a four hour photoelectrolysis, oxygen was formed at the rates of 6.25 μmol h−1, 24.77 μmol h−1 and 27.78 μmol h−1 on BiVO4, Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4, respectively. Additionally, the stoichiometric ratio of evolved oxygen to hydrogen detected on the counter electrodes was close to 1:2. The faradaic efficiencies of the electrodes were obtained by comparing the actual amount of detected O2 with the theoretical amount of O2, which was calculated from the generated photocurrent by assuming that all charges were used for 4e− oxidation of water. As shown in Fig. S11,† Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4 exhibit a significant increase in faradaic efficiency (88% and 91%, respectively) relative to the bare BiVO4 (74%), indicating that by introducing Co(salophen) complexes, more surface arriving holes are utilised through a four-electron transfer process. These results demonstrate that the modification of Co(salophen) complexes on BiVO4 photoanodes as high-performance OER catalysts can not only increase the photocurrent, but also selectively improve the kinetics of the O2 evolution reaction.
Real catalyst or catalyst precursor
For a molecular WOC, a notable question is whether the complex is a real homogeneous catalyst or only functions as a precursor of the heterogeneous active species.48–51 To exclude the possibility that the enhancement in PEC performance was due to the Co2+ or heterogeneous CoOx formed from the dissociation of the molecular catalyst, the following experiments were conducted. First, the control experiments were conducted by using the BiVO4 electrode soaked in a solution containing only cobalt ions or a salophen ligand, and no increase in photocurrent density can be observed (Fig. S12†), suggesting that the Co(salophen) complexes themselves are necessary to improve the PEC performance. Second, a certain amount of 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy) was added to the electrolyte as a chelating agent to clarify the contribution from the probable free cobalt ions released from the Co(salophen) complexes.26,52,53 As shown in Fig. 7a and S13,† the presence of bpy has no influence on the photocurrent. Though it cannot completely exclude the existence of the released cobalt ions, it can verify that the improved photocurrent is not due to free cobalt ions. Moreover, Co2+/BiVO4 exhibits an unchanged i–t curve compared with BiVO4 (Fig. S14†), indicating that even trace amounts of Co2+ released from the Co(salophen) complexes will not form sufficient CoOx which can lead to an enhanced photocurrent, which rules out the possibility that the improved photocurrent is due to the CoOx nanoparticles formed by Co2+ during photoelectrolysis. Third, UV-vis measurements for Co(salophen) complexes in solution showed that the complexes were protected from degradation under illumination (Fig. 7b and S15†). Fourth, if CoOx or Co–Pi forms on the electrode, there is usually an obvious increase or decrease in photocurrent.54–57 However, in this work, the photocurrent is very stable. After a three hour photoelectrolysis, no morphology change and no obvious new nanoparticles are found on the surface of BiVO4 from the SEM images (Fig. 7c and S16†), indicating that the cobalt complexes did not decompose to form heterogeneous cobalt oxide materials. Fifth, the Raman spectra revealed that the signals of the Co(salophen) complexes remain unchanged after photoelectrolysis (Fig. 7d and S17†), confirming the molecular integrity of the Co(salophen) catalyst on the electrode. Therefore, based on the above results, we speculate that the real catalyst is the molecular Co(salophen) complex itself. On the other hand, this work provides a simple and efficient way to introduce a WOC onto a semiconductor photoanode. Even if the molecular catalyst had partly, or completely changed to other active species, such enhancement and stability of the photocurrent are still noteworthy in PEC water oxidation.

Experimental
Chemicals and reagents
All chemical reagents including Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, VO(acac)2, p-benzoquinone, o-phenylenediamine, salicylic aldehyde, 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde, and Co(OAc)2·4H2O were purchased from Aldrich or Aladdin. All other reagents were commercially sourced and used without further purification. The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates (surface resistivity of 8–12 Ω sq−1) were purchased from Zhuhai Kaivo Electronic Components Co., Ltd. Prior to the electrochemical experiments, the FTO plates were cleaned by ultrasonication in deionised water, acetone, and ethanol, respectively, at least three times (5 min).
Synthesis of Co(salophen) complexes
Co(salophen) complexes were synthesised according to a method previously reported.29,48 First, the salophen ligand was synthesised by adding o-phenylenediamine (5 mmol) and salicyl-aldehyde or 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde (10 mmol) to ethanol (25 mL) at room temperature (RT), and then the solution mixture was refluxed for six hours. The precipitated Schiff-base ligand was filtered, giving the desired product, the salophen ligand. The corresponding ligand and Co(OAc)2·4H2O (molar ratio 1:1.2) were added to ethanol (30 mL). Then the mixture was refluxed for two hours. During refluxing, the colour of the reaction solution changed as opposed to the starting ligand. After cooling to RT, the precipitate was filtered with a Buchner funnel and washed three times each with deionised water and ethanol. The obtained precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven for 10 hours at RT.
Preparation of BiVO4 electrodes
The BiVO4 thin film was prepared by modification of a method reported by Choi and co-workers.13 Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (0.04 M) and KI (0.4 M) were added to a solution of HNO3 (50 mL, pH = 1.7). This solution was then mixed with absolute ethanol (20 mL) containing 0.23 M p-benzoquinone, and was vigorously stirred for twenty minutes. A typical three-electrode cell was used for electrodeposition with a FTO working electrode, an Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) reference electrode, and a platinum counter electrode. Cathodic deposition was performed potentiostatically at −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl at RT with deposition times of five minutes. The BiOI electrode was then obtained after rinsing with deionised water and air-drying. 0.2 mL of a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution containing 0.2 M vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) was placed on the BiOI electrode (1 cm × 1 cm) and heated in a muffle furnace at varying temperatures for two hours in air to convert BiOI to BiVO4. BiVO4 electrodes showing the highest photocurrent were obtained when BiOI electrodes were annealed at 450 °C (ramp rate = 2 °C min−1) for two hours. Excess V2O5 present in the BiVO4 electrodes was removed by soaking in 1 M NaOH solution for 45 min with gentle stirring. The resulting pure BiVO4 electrodes were rinsed with deionised water and dried at RT.
Fabrication of Co(salophen)/FTO electrodes
The Co(salophen) complexes (0.5 mM) were dissolved in acetonitrile with 5% Nafion. After ultrasound treatment for 20 min, 60 μL of the solution was cast onto the FTO, and dried in air.
Fabrication of the Co(salophen)/BiVO4 electrode
The assembled Co(salophen)/BiVO4 electrode was finally obtained by soaking the BiVO4 electrode in an acetonitrile solution containing a 0.5 mM Co(salophen) catalyst at RT for 10 hours in the dark, followed by rinsing with excess acetonitrile and drying with N2. In the same way, we obtained the Co2+/BiVO4 electrode by soaking the BiVO4 electrode in an acetonitrile solution containing 0.5 mM cobalt acetate.
Characterisation
The purity and crystal structure of BiVO4 electrodes were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (Bruker Smart APEX II). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) spectra of the films were obtained with a SU8000 Schottky field emission scanning electron microscope (SFE-SEM) equipped with a Rontec EDX system. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained on a Lambda 35 UV-vis spectrophotometer, in which the sample electrode was placed in the centre of an integrating sphere to measure all the reflected and transmitted light to accurately assess the absorbance. FTO glass was used as the reference for these absorption measurements. The element content was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP, PE-43008300). Raman spectra were collected using a Raman spectrometer (Renishaw inVia). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurements were carried out on a thermo scientific ESCALAB 250 instrument (150 W, spot size of 500 μm and Al Kα radiation at 1486.6 eV) to obtain the surface elements.
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical methods
Electrochemical experiments were performed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell with a CHI 660E instrument potentiostat (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd.) at RT. In a three-electrode electrochemical system, the photoanodes were used as working electrodes, with an Ag/AgCl electrode (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. The photoelectrodes were irradiated using a Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300C) equipped with AM 1.5G-filtered illumination, and the light intensity was calibrated to be 100 mW cm−2. The light irradiation came from behind the photoelectrodes. J–V curves were obtained by linear sweep voltammetry with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. All measured potentials were converted to the RHE (ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197 V + 0.059 pH). Generally, the electrolyte was a 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution.
IMPS measurements were conducted using a potentiostat (IM6ex, Zahner Company) controlled by a Zahner IMPS electrochemical workstation. Intensity-modulated light was provided by a light-emitting diode (LED) that allowed superimposition of sinusoidal modulation (∼10%) at a dc illumination level. The wavelength of light was 426 nm with an average intensity of 10 W m−2. The photocurrent as a function of frequency (from 10 kHz to 100 mHz) was recorded at different potentials. The same three-electrode configuration and electrolyte were employed as given in the PEC characterization section.
The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) was calculated from the J–V curve using the equation:  where J is the photocurrent density, Vbias is the applied bias, and Pin is the incident illumination power density (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2).
Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) at each wavelength was measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE using monochromatic light illumination from a 300 W Xe arc lamp equipped with a CEAULIGHT CEL-IS151 monochromator. The IPCE values have been calculated using the equation:  where J is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), λ is the incident light wavelength (nm), and Pin is the measured irradiance (mW cm−2). λ is the incident light wavelength (nm), and Pin is the measured irradiance (mW cm−2).
The evolved oxygen and hydrogen were measured using a Gas Chromatograph 6890A using a thermal conductivity detector and argon as the carrier gas. Prior to the measurement, the electrolyte was degassed by bubbling with high purity Ar for 30 minutes. The faradaic efficiency was calculated by assuming that all of the charges were caused by 4e-oxidation of water to produce O2.
Conclusions
In summary, two molecular WOC/semiconductor hybrid photoanodes (Co1/BiVO4 and Co2/BiVO4) were prepared by introducing Co(salophen) complexes onto BiVO4via hydrophobic interaction for PEC water oxidation in neutral water. Co(salophen) complexes gave rise to a remarkable enhancement in the PEC performance by restraining the surface recombination of the photoanodes. Under AM 1.5G illumination, an impressive transient photocurrent of 4.27 mA cm−2 was obtained at 1.23 V RHE for Co2/BiVO4, nearly three times higher than that of the bare BiVO4. Studies on surface kinetics by IMPS measurements demonstrate that Co(salophen) complexes improve the PEC performance by simultaneously accelerating the water oxidation reaction and reducing the surface recombination. Additionally, an extremely stable photocurrent of more than 3.5 mA cm−2 is sustained for at least three hours without decay. The resulting photoanodes based on a molecular WOC achieved robust PEC activity and excellent stability. These results suggest that the rational design of molecular WOC/semiconductor photoanodes holds great promise for future applications in efficient solar-fuel conversion.
