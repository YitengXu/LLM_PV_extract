    , Accepted 26th August 2022First published on 26th August 2022AbstractTwo-dimensional layered materials have been universally acknowledged to be promising candidates for alternative precious metals in the field of catalysis. The crystal-facet effect is currently rare in the field of electrocatalysis and a deep understanding of the catalytic mechanism of bimetallic highly active crystal facets is critical for fabricating high-performance catalysts, but details are still lacking. Herein, we demonstrated a solvent-induced strategy to manufacture well-defined structured CoNi-layered double hydroxides (LHDs) for highly efficient water electrolysis, and gave a detailed mechanism of catalytic activity towards an enhanced OER. Such considerable improvement in catalytic activity was attributed not only to the synergistic catalytic effect of bimetallic hydroxides, but also to the crystal-facet effect, which is caused by the high density of unsaturated-coordination of surface metal atoms. Consequently, the adsorption energy was enhanced and the activation energy of the target reaction was lowered. These unsaturated coordination surface or edge metal atoms can be easily oxidized to form a great amount of active oxyhydroxides, such as β-NiOOH intermediates. In addition, the adjacent Co sites can also regulate the redox reaction kinetics of Ni(OH)2/NiOOH and synergistically catalyze the OER.
Introduction
Electrochemical water splitting to produce hydrogen fuel, powered by green energy sources such as wind, tide and solar, is one of the most practical alternatives for a clean energy cycle. Hence, the existing issues of the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are being addressed by rational design and synthesis of highly efficient catalysts.1–3 Noble metal-based catalysts possess high intrinsic catalytic activity and can efficiently reduce the overpotential of water splitting; however, their scarcity with high cost limits their wide application. Hence, developing non-precious-metal-based catalysts is urgently needed.4
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are widely used in the fields of electrocatalysis5,6 and electrochemical energy storage,7,8 because of their advantages, such as a high specific surface area, feasibility of tailoring the electronic/physical structure and combination with other functional materials.9,10 Although a tremendous amount of protocols, such as engineering defects,11–13 generating vacancies,14–16 creating lattice strain,17–19 hybridizing a multi-metallic and/or nonmetallic interface,9,13–16etc., has been applied to further develop their intrinsic activity, engineering high-energy crystal facets to regulate the catalytic activity for water splitting is less investigated.20,21 Most of them showed an outstanding catalytic performance in the fields of photocatalysis,22–25 photoelectrocatalysis26–28 and traditional thermocatalysis.29,30 Regarding the electrocatalysis, Nakamura et al. demonstrated the correlation between the stability of the intermediate species and crystal facets by monitoring the surface intermediates of the OER on rutile MnO2 with different facet orientations.31 Carter et al. surveyed the OER activities of β-NiOOH with the crystallographic facets of {0001} and {100}, where six-fold-lattice-oxygen-coordinated and five-fold-lattice-oxygen-coordinated Ni sites were exposed, respectively, using hybrid density functional theory,32 and discovered that each crystallographic facet exhibited remarkably different electrocatalytic activities towards the OER. Therefore, tailoring highly-active crystal facets is another efficient protocol to optimize the electrocatalytic performance. In addition, most of these facet-engineering approaches are energy-extensive and uneconomical, as they use metal organic framework (MOF) materials as precursors,21,33 controlled atmosphere high temperature sintering,34–37 chemical vapor deposition (CVD),26,38etc. which make the realization of large-scale production difficult.
Herein, we demonstrated a facile ethanol-induced strategy to synthesize a micro-honeycomb-sphered CoNi-based LDH [Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E] with high-index-exposed {003} facets for efficient overall water splitting, whereas CoNi LDHs consisting of nanorods obtained in water exhibit unsatisfactory catalytic ability. The Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E presents abundant unsaturated coordination centers on both the surface and edge, promoting the formation of an active oxyhydroxide intermediate for the OER. In addition, a synergistic catalytic effect of Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E was also observed, as the transformation from Ni(OH)2 to active NiOOH is enhanced with the help of Co, leading to the oxygen evolution reaction probably via the lattice oxygen mechanism pathway.
Experimental

Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, AR, 99%) was purchased from Macklin, Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, AR, ≥98.0%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Urea (CH4N2O, AR, ≥99.0%), potassium hydroxide (KOH, AR, ≥90.0%) and ethanol (C2H5OH, AR, ≥99.7%) were bought from Shanghai Titan Scientific Co., Ltd. All the chemicals were used without further purification. Aluminium oxide powder (Al2O3, 0.05 μm) from Xinhui (Changsha) Electronic Technological Co., Ltd. was used to polish the disk electrodes. The Hg/HgO reference electrode and the carbon rod counter electrode were purchased from Gaoss Union (Tianjin) Photoelectric Technology Co., Ltd.
Catalyst synthesis
Solvothermal and hydrothermal methods were employed to synthesize CoxNi1−x(OH)2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) materials. CoxNi1−x(OH)2-W and -E represent the materials prepared in water and ethanol, respectively. The precursor solution of Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W was prepared by dissolving 0.50 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.50 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.77 g of CH4N2O in 40 mL of deionized water, and the precursor solutions of CoxNi1−x(OH)2-E were prepared by dissolving a certain proportion of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, and 0.77 g of CH4N2O in 40 mL of ethanol. All the solutions were then transferred into sealed PTFE reactors under 120 °C for 5 hours. CoxNi1−x(OH)2 materials were obtained after washing with water and ethanol, centrifugation and then drying in an oven at 60 °C for 12 hours.
Preparation of working electrodes
A catalytic ink containing 4 mg of CoxNi1−x(OH)2, 4 mg of Vulcan XC-72R carbon powder and 20 μL of Nafion®117 solution (∼5% in a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and water) in 1 mL of ethanol was drop-cast on a glassy carbon (GC) disk electrode with a diameter of 0.5 cm to obtain a CoxNi1−x(OH)2/GC electrode. The humidified electrode was quick-dried under 160 °C for 10 min to evaporate ethanol and employed as a working electrode for electrochemical measurements.
Characterization
The well-prepared CoxNi1−x(OH)2 nanomaterials were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-6701F, Japan) in combination with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-F200) operated at 200 kV accelerating voltage, with EDX mappings (Oxford X-MET 8000), X-ray diffraction (XRD, XPert Pro MPD) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi), and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM, JEOL JEM-ARM200F) using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was determined using a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 nitrogen adsorption–desorption apparatus. The measurements of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Co/Ni K-edge containing the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were performed at the beamline 4B9A of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), China. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed on a Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer.
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical measurements were performed on the CHI660E electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument, Inc.) equipped with a rotating disk electrode (RDE, Pine Research Instrumentation) in a three-electrode system, consisting of a working electrode, a carbon rod counter electrode and a Hg/HgO reference electrode. The testing electrolyte 1 mol L−1 KOH was bubbled with ultra-high pure argon (99.99%) for at least 30 minutes before use. Cyclic voltammograms were acquired at a rotation rate of 1600 rpm with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. A current–time curve for the catalytic stability of CoxNi1−x(OH)2 was recorded at 1.55 V vs. RHE at 1600 rpm for 10 h. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were executed at 0.6 V (vs. Hg/HgO) in the frequency range of 0.01–105 Hz with an AC amplitude of 5 mV. The potentials were converted to RHE using the following equation: E(RHE) = E(vs. Hg/HgO) + Eθ(Hg/HgO) + 0.059 pH. In situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy measurements were conducted in a lab-built Raman cell, which consists of a polycrystalline Au working electrode with a diameter of 0.5, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (E(RHE) = E(vs. Ag/AgCl) + Eθ(Ag/AgCl) + 0.059 pH) and a Pt wire counter electrode. The generated gas is also exhausted through the in/outlet to maintain a constant electrolyte level with less bubble scattering. In situ Raman spectra were acquired with a LabRAM HR 800 Raman spectrometer using a 532 nm laser at a power of about 0.3 mW.
Results and discussion
Physical characteristics of CoxNi1−x(OH)2 catalysts
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to examine the phase and structural information. As shown in Fig. 1a, the crystallinity of the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E demonstrates a preferred {003} (PDF#33-0429, comblainite) texture while this facet intensity is weak in Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W, indicating that the material prepared in ethanol presents a particular 2D structure. Then the SEM images (Fig. 1b and c and S1†) confirm that Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E spheres with diameters of around 2–10 μm are fabricated from folded 2D sheets. The zoomed-in SEM image in Fig. 1d further shows that the 2D structure is formed by the oriented agglomeration of particles. In comparison, Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W also displays a spherical morphology (Fig. S2a–c†); however, the enlarged SEM image shows that the sphere consists of a large number of needle-like nanorods (Fig. S2d†). More details for comparison were observed by HR-TEM (Fig. 1f–h and S3, S4†). The lattice fringes of 0.76 nm, 0.25 nm and 0.23 nm (Fig. 1f–h) are ascribed to the {003}, {012}, and {015} crystal facets, respectively, in Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E. The spherical Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E sample consists of numerous nanosheets with a thickness of ∼20 nm, and these nanosheets are full of nanoholes, as a foam-like structure of CoNi-LDHs (Fig. S5†). A regular arrangement of surface atoms was observed as shown in Fig. 1i, except for some lattice dislocation domains. Unlike most facet engineering, individualized crystals with a regular structure and a certain crystal facet exposed on the whole surface were controllably prepared.39,40 However, the nanorod unit of Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W exhibits dense discontinuous lattice fringes with a distance of 0.23 nm (Fig. S4e†), which corresponds to the crystallographic plane of {015}. Both EDX mappings (Fig. 1e and Fig. S1–S4†) reveal that Co, Ni, and O elements are uniformly distributed throughout the samples.

The adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E and -W were studied by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption method as shown in Fig. S6.† Both adsorption curves demonstrated a closed hysteresis loop between the relative pressure (P/P0) of 0.4–0.8, signifying the existence of a mesoporous structure, which is consistent with the observation from HAADF-STEM. Furthermore, an obvious H4-type hysteresis loop between 0.8 and 1.0 and the absence of a saturated adsorption platform at high pressure suggest the existence of stacking pores. The pore size distribution of Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E and Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W was determined to be around 3.40 and 3.76 nm, respectively. The calculated specific surface area of Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E and -W was 63.3 and 22.7 m2 g−1, respectively, suggesting that Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E has a nearly threefold-higher surface area than Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W. These results indicate that the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E sample has a much higher surface area available for water electrolysis.
The formation of a layered double hydroxide structure in Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E and Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) as shown in Fig. 2a. Obviously, remarkable differences exist, particularly at 2200 cm−1, which is probably attributed to the OCN− resulting from the pyrolysis of urea,41 and the rest at 997 cm−1, ∼1300 cm−1, and 3630 cm−1 are attributed to the R–O stretching vibration in ethers presumably formed by the reaction between ethanol molecules, the CH2 antisymmetric stretching vibration, and the O–H stretching vibration, respectively. These indicate that the residual ethanol and the produced organic species were at the surface and even in the interlayer. A broad peak at 650 cm−1 is related to the stretching vibrations of Co–O and Ni–O.42 The adsorption bands at 1380 cm−1 and 1615 cm−1 are contributed by NO3− derived from the intercalation of nitrate ions in the layered structure43 and the carboxylate band.44 Another broad peak at 3430 cm−1 is typically assigned to the stretching vibration of the intermolecular hydrogen bond (O–H) from the adsorbed H2O molecules as well as the interlayer H2O molecules.42

Further information on the surface element composition was obtained by XPS. The survey spectra of Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E and Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W are shown in Fig. S7.† The comparison of Co 2p, Ni 2p, and O 1s on the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E and Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W surfaces as shown in Fig. 2b–d, respectively, reveals no obvious difference between these two materials, except for O 1s (Fig. 2d). To be specific, two Co 2p peaks appeared at a binding energy of 781.4 eV (Co 2p3/2) and 797.3 eV (Co 2p1/2), leading to a spin–orbit splitting energy of 15.9 eV and implying that Co(OH)2 was formed.45 For Ni 2p, typically, the spin–orbit splitting energy of 17.6 eV between these two Ni 2p peaks at 856.1 eV (Ni 2p3/2) and 873.7 eV (Ni 2p1/2) indicates the presence of Ni(OH)2.46 The O 1s XPS was fitted into two peaks located at 531.7 eV and 533.2 eV, which were assigned to the M–OH bonds and the adsorbed O bonds (–Oads., mostly from H2O), respectively. In contrast, the peak intensity of –Oads. on the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E surface is higher than that obtained on the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W surface, indicating that the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E surface presents a large population of O species which probably benefits the critical oxygen-adsorption process and the oxidation process of Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E to NiOOH and CoOOH during the OER. These results agree with the FTIR results. Furthermore, N 1s peaks were present for the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E surface, but are absent for the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W surface (Fig. S7†). This result further confirmed that a small amount of N species existed on the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E surface.
To further explore the detailed structure–function relationship, an XAS study on Co and Ni K-edges was performed as shown in Fig. 3 and used to illustrate the coordination environments and valence states of Co and Ni in both Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E and -W catalysts. For both catalysts, the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES in Fig. 3a and e) indicates that the valence states of both Co and Ni are typical +2. However, there are a slight blue-shift and a red-shift around near-edge areas, respectively (zoomed-in images in Fig. 3a and e), which means a synergistic electronic transfer from Ni sites to Co sites in the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E sample. From the Fourier transforms of k3-weighted Co and Ni K-edge EXAFS spectra (Fig. 3b and f), a two-spherical hydroxide structure is observed. Both Co and Ni in the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E sample demonstrate an ∼1.4 Å (with a shoulder) M–O bond and a 2.7 Å (M–M) bond, indicating that the Co and Ni sites are substitutionally located at the central metal sites of an octahedral hydroxide cage. However, crystallization from the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W sample is much different. The first spherical shell of Co at ∼1.4 Å displays an obviously split shoulder, indicating an over-strong Co–O coordination on Co sites and this may cause difficulties in the adsorption of oxygen species for the OER. Meanwhile, the intensity of Ni–M is also too weak, reflecting discontinuous crystallization in the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W sample. The Wavelet transformation of the K space (Fig. 3c, d, g and h) also confirms this to be a coordination environment.

Electrochemical characteristics of CoxNi1−x(OH)2 catalysts

Composition optimization of CoxNi1−x(OH)2-E catalysts. 
The electrochemical catalytic performances of the synthesized CoxNi1−x(OH)2-E catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were investigated in Ar saturated 1 M KOH solution (Fig. 4a–f). To achieve the optimal composition of CoxNi1−x(OH)2-E, a series of CoxNi1−x(OH)2-E samples were fabricated by varying the value of x from 1 to 0 to obtain different ratios of Co/Ni. With the decrease of Co/Ni ratio, the catalytic activity initially increased and then decreased (Fig. 4a). The best performance was observed on the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E sample for both the OER and HER. The lowest OER potentials at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4b) are around 1.51 V and 1.6 V, respectively. Their corresponding Tafel slopes are also derived in Fig. 4c; a lower Tafel slope of 81 mV dec−1 was obtained at the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E surface. In addition, turnover frequency (TOF) refers to the number of target reactions occurring per unit active site and unit time under the given conditions, which reflects the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Thus, the Ni-turnover frequency (Ni-TOF) at a potential of 1.6 V for each CoxNi1−x(OH)2-E catalyst shown in Fig. S8† was calculated according to the equations described in the literature.47 The highest TOF was obtained on Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E, also suggesting a highly active catalyst. Therefore, its catalytic activity towards the OER is superior to those various (Ni or Co)-based LDH catalysts and noble metal catalysts reported in the literature as listed in Table S1.† For the HER, a similar catalytic activity variation trend was observed (Fig. 4d). The overpotentials at 10 mA cm−2 as plotted in Fig. 4e and Tafel slopes as shown in Fig. 4f suggest that Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E has the lowest overpotential of 0.23 V at 10 mA cm−2 and a smaller Tafel slope of 95 mV dec−1, which means that the HER occurred with significantly faster kinetics on the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E surface.

(i) The histograms of the charge densities of anodic and cathodic peaks on the CoxNi1−x(OH)2-E surface as shown in (g) and their corresponding reversibility. 
Then we carried out cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the CoNi LDH sample with different Co/Ni ratios to determine the active phase transfer during the OER process. As shown in Fig. 4g, the redox peaks in the potential range of 1.1–1.5 V are attributed to the transformation of Ni(OH)2 ↔ NiOOH,48,49 which proceeds as Ni(OH)2 + OH− ↔ NiOOH + H2O + e− in alkaline solutions. Oxidation currents at higher potentials are mainly contributed by the evolution of oxygen: 4OH− → O2 + 2H2O + 4e−. With the increase of Co content, the oxidation peaks shift to the negative direction while the redox couplet peaks become closer (Fig. 4g and h). The negative oxidation peak shift indicates that the adjacent Co atoms can reduce the overpotentials of Ni(OH)2 ↔ NiOOH. The trend of closer redox couplet peaks indicates that Co is able to improve the reversibility of the redox process of Ni(OH)2 ↔ NiOOH. This process is also confirmed by comparing the charge densities of oxidation and reduction peaks (Fig. 4i). The highest reversibility of 86.1% was observed on the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E catalyst.
The enhancement of Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E catalytic activities towards the OER and HER was analysed theoretically and confirmed experimentally. For bimetallic/multimetallic catalysts, the adsorption energy50 of all the involved species during the reaction, the dissociation energy51 of reactants, and the binding energy of intermediates52,53 were optimized through the regulated surface electronic structure formed by the modification of foreign metals, usually concerned about the changes in the d-band center54–56 and eg orbital occupancy.57,58 Indeed, all the catalytic enhancement effects, such as the coordination/ligand effect,59–61 the strain effect,62,63 the size effect,64 the alloying effect,65 the crystal-facet effect,21,32etc. can be ultimately attributed to the change in the surface electronic structure of catalysts, achieving the optimization of surface adsorption energy.66 However, to our knowledge, the spillover effect46,67–69 does not involve the changes in the surface electronic structure, but originates from the spilling of intermediates or products from their corresponding optimized adsorption sites to desorption sites, releasing more free active sites for further reactions. A hydrogen/oxygen spillover effect has been observed at the catalyst surface during the different catalytic reactions.68,69 In this work, the enhancement in the synergistic catalytic effects of bimetallic Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2 for the HER and OER was speculated to be attributed to both the optimized surface electronic structure and the hydrogen/oxygen spillover effect.
In addition, it was also mentioned that lattice oxygen spillover dynamically takes place during the electrocatalytic reaction.70 The lattice oxygen evolution mechanism was proposed for the OER at the NiCo-LDH surface, where NiOO− is a precursor to oxygen.71 Hence, combining the above experimental results, bulk Co/Ni interfaces and Ni sites in CoNi-LDHs are active and evolve oxygen via a NiOO− precursor, and the OER mechanism would most likely be passed via the lattice oxygen mediated mechanism, which was discussed in detail in the literature.72 On the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2 surface, Co incorporation can not only enhance the kinetics and reversibility of the conversion process of Ni(OH)2 ⇄ NiOOH, but also change the nature of the active sites, and accordingly dramatically improve the electrocatalytic activities towards both the OER and HER. In particular, the metal sites exposed on the {003} facet after releasing lattice oxygen or with an unsaturated coordination environment have moderate surface adsorption energy of reactants and intermediates and desorption energy of products, and easier electron transfer cross the solid–liquid/gas two-phase interface, thereby improving their catalytic activity.


Comparison of the catalytic performance of Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E and -W catalysts. 
It is found that the synthesis media significantly regulate the growth mode of materials, thus exposing the specific crystal facets for catalytic performance. Specifically, Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E (synthesized in ethanol) and Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W (synthesized in water) demonstrated a dramatic difference in the catalytic activity towards both the HER and OER, as shown in Fig. 5a and d, respectively. In addition, no redox peak was seen on the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W sample (Fig. 5d, S9 and S10†). Such a difference is probably due to the unsaturated coordination environment of the active metal sites on this specific crystal facet or its edges, where the adsorption and reaction processes were enhanced. Fig. 5c is plotted to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the HER, and 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2 for the OER, with Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E and Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W requiring overpotentials of 0.23 V, 1.51 V, and 1.60 V, and 0.44 V, 1.60 V, and 1.70 V, respectively. The Tafel slope is usually employed to reveal the reaction mechanism and the rate determining step (RDS). From the kinetic point of view, highly efficient catalysts should have a smaller Tafel slope to achieve a higher current density at low overpotentials. For both the HER and OER, the Tafel slopes on Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E are 95 mV dec−1 and 81 mV dec−1, respectively, which are lower than those observed on Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W (Fig. 5b and e), indicating fast reaction kinetics for both the HER and OER on Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is usually used to determine the resistance of an electrolyte (Rs), double layer capacitance (Cdl) and charge transfer resistance (Rct, or kinetic resistance) at the solid–liquid interface. EIS spectra were acquired at a potential of 1.52 V vs. RHE. Rs was detected to be 6 Ω, which was used for iR-correction to remove the solution resistance. Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E showed the lowest Rct of 46 Ω compared with Co(OH)2-E, Ni(OH)2-E, and Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W (Fig. 5f), suggesting that the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E sample has the best charge-transport efficiency among the studied samples. Furthermore, to estimate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), the values of Cdl (Fig. 5g and S12†) were calculated using cyclic voltammograms (Fig. S11†) in the potential range of 1.325–1.525 V (vs. RHE). The Cdl value obtained for Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E and Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W was 273 mF cm−2 and 11 mF cm−2, respectively (Fig. 5g), suggesting that Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E has a larger ECSA. The turnover frequency (TOF) which refers to the number of target reactions occurring per unit active site and unit time under the given conditions was calculated as well. The TOF values of Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E and Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W at potentials in the range of 1.5–1.6 V were plotted (Fig. 5h). At each potential, the TOF of Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E is always higher than that of Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W. For example, at 1.50 V and 1.60 V, the TOF of Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E is ∼1.5 times and ∼9.5 times higher than that of Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W, respectively. Moreover, Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E exhibits excellent stability towards the OER during the tested period (Fig. 5i). All these results indicate that the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E sample has good catalytic activity and stability towards both the HER and OER.

In situ Raman spectroscopy of Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2 catalysts
The structure of Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2 was characterized in situ by Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 6a and b show a series of Raman spectra for Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E and Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W on Au substrates in 1 M KOH, acquired at different applied potentials (vs. Ag/AgCl) in the OER region. For both Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E and -W catalysts, the doublet peaks in the range of 473–528 cm−1 appeared even before 0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), suggesting an easier phase transformation from Ni(OH)2 to the active NiOOH intermediate phase (mixtures of β-NiOOH and/or γ-NiOOH) at small overpotentials. Notably, the larger I525/I474 peak intensity ratio suggests that more β-NiOOH is generated and β-NiOOH is suggested to be a more active intermediate structure for the OER.32,73–75 For Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E, the peak intensity ratio I525/I474 at 0.2 V and 0.6 V was determined to be 2.4 and 1.4, respectively, while for Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W, the peak intensity ratio I528/I483 at 0.2 V and 0.6 V were evaluated to be 1.5 and 1, respectively. These results manifest that the peak intensity ratio I525/I474 detected at the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E surface is always significantly higher than I528/I483 detected on the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W surface in the whole OER potential region, suggesting that more β-NiOOH phase was generated on the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E surface than that on the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W surface in the whole potential range.

Furthermore, a slight shift in the Ni–OH stretching mode from 474 to 468 cm−1 on the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E surface appears to be characteristic of the transformation of α- to β-Ni(OH)2.76 These results are consistent with the electrochemical evaluation results as shown in Fig. 4g. For Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W, the decline of I528/I483 peak intensity ratio indicates that β-NiOOH was probably transformed to disordered Ni(OH)2, as suggested by the peak appearing at 504 cm−1 with the increase in the applied potential, which was not the case for Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E. In brief, compared with Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-W, more active β-NiOOH intermediate phases can be formed on the Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E surface, and those can be easily formed at a relatively lower overpotential, which was also confirmed by the electrochemical measurement results shown in Fig. 5d, f and S10.† In addition, the conversion process of Ni(OH)2 ↔ NiOOH appeared before the OER due to the unsaturated coordination environment of surface metal atoms on the highly-active {003} facets or at the edges, and its reversibility was higher. As we mentioned above, the adjacent Co sites can also promote the redox reaction kinetics of Ni(OH)2/NiOOH. Hence, Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E exhibits excellent catalytic activity and stability towards the OER, and such higher enhancements of catalytic activity towards the OER of the CoNi-LDH surface are mainly attributed to the crystal-facet and synergistic catalytic effects of bimetallic catalysts.
Conclusions
Solvent-induced structure engineering of CoNi-LDHs was carried out via a facile approach that is easy to realize large-scale synthesis, and the obtained material exhibited outstanding catalytic activity towards both the HER and OER in alkaline media, especially, Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E, which is synthesized in ethanol and has a micro-sphere-like structure consisting of nanosheets with highly-active exposed facets, demonstrated the highest catalytic activities. At the output current density of 10 mA cm−2, the feedback potentials for the OER and HER are only 1.51 V and 0.23 V vs. RHE, respectively. On one hand, the synthetic solvent can induce the growth mode of materials and prompt orientated growth, thereby exposing highly-active facets, where the unsaturated coordination metal centers could be easily oxidized at relatively lower overpotentials to form more active *OOH intermediates. On the other hand, Co can enhance the kinetics of the Ni(OH)2/NiOOH redox process and improve its reversibility, thus exhibiting a strong synergistic catalytic effect. It is convincing that the enhanced activities of bimetallic Co0.67Ni0.33(OH)2-E are attributed to not only the crystal-facet effect, but also the synergistic catalytic effect. These findings provide insight into the design principle for engineering bimetallic catalysts with highly active exposed facets and a strong synergistic effect, as an effective approach to modulate the physicochemical properties of transition metal hydroxides, boosting their intrinsic catalytic activity.
