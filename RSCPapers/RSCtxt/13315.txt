An analytical model is developed to elucidate the interface confinement and power conversion efficiency (PCE). It is found that the band curvature and surface barrier height decrease with decreasing size. The interface recombination rate and PCE can be determined by the size, shell thickness and local interface conditions. Our theoretical results show evident improvement in the PCE of SiNWs under interface confinement compared to that of a bare nanowire, highlighting the feasibility of the epitaxial layer as a booster for highly efficient SiNW solar cells.
Introduction
Recently, silicon nanowires (SiNWs) have become one of the ideal candidates for applications in optoelectronic nanodevices.1–3 In order to obtain optimal power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for nanowire solar cells, a variety of methods have been employed both experimentally4–8 and theoretically.9–12 It is evidenced that the electronic and optoelectronic properties of SiNWs can be influenced by several factors, including size, shape and interface modification.13 In theory, the classical detailed balance principle (DBP) is the general method to deal with the PCEs of solar cells.9 However, the contributions from the atoms located at the edge parts of nanowires have been almost neglected.
Actually, as the dimensions of specimens continue to shrink, the high coordination imperfection of edge atoms as well as quantum potential depression would significantly affect their performances. As the size of nanowires decreases below the critical size, the surface barrier height and band curvature decrease due to the reduction of the depletion region, which can enhance the recombination rate.14–16 Importantly, in terms of the atomic-bond-relaxation (ABR) consideration,17–19 with further shrinking of the dimensions to a few nanometers, the surface atoms will play a crucial role in the binding energy and electronic structure owing to the high surface-to-volume ratio (SVR) and the dangling bond.
Strikingly, covering the SiNWs with a thin epitaxial layer is of great benefit to their photoelectric properties because the shell can reduce the surface state and suppress the recombination rate.20,21 Even more than that, core/shell nanostructures afford a large interface area and a direct electrical pathway for the rapid transport and separation of photo-generated carriers, leading to a dramatic increase of carrier collection efficiency and the associated PCE.2,22 Although much effort has been made to report the effect of epitaxial layers on the PCE of nanowire solar cells, there is a lack of quantitative theoretical analyses. Moreover, the physical mechanism of the relationship between the size-dependent band offset and the associated PCEs of SiNW solar cells under interface confinement remains unclear. In this contribution, we report an analytical model to pursue the relationship among the band offset, interface confinement and PCEs of SiNW solar cells based on the combination of DBP and ABR consideration. Theoretical predictions based on the proposed model are in accordance with the available evidence.
Principle
In general, the surface and interface of nanosolids are considered as the crucial features that can affect the related physical and chemical properties due to a high ratio of reduced coordination numbers (CNs) of atoms at edges. According to the core idea of the atomic-bond-relaxation method,17–19,23 the bond identities of edge atoms, including the bond length and strength, would be shorter and stronger compared to those of the bulk counterpart. Therefore, nanosolids will be in a self-equilibrium state. Meanwhile, the self-equilibrium strain results in a perturbation to the total Hamiltonian. In this case, the lattice strain can be expressed as ε = d*/d0 − 1, where d* and d0 are the average bond length in the nanosolids and the bond length in the bulk counterparts, respectively. Considering the discrepancy between the surface and interior atoms of a nanowire, the total strain can be deduced as: , where zi and zb are the effective coordination numbers (CNs) of a specific ith atomic layer and the bulk, and the effective CNs of the first, second and third Si layers take the following values: z1 = 4(1 − 1.5/D), z2 = z1 + 2, and z3 = 12,17ns represents the number of surface shells, ci = 2/(1 + exp((12 − zi)/8zi)) and  are the bond contraction coefficient and SVR, and D denotes the diameter of a nanowire.
In addition, considering a thin epitaxial layer grown on a nanowire, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1, the interface strain can be defined as εm = (as − ac)/ac, where as and ac are the lattice constants of the shell and the core. In terms of continuum mechanics, the mean strain tensor for a core/shell nanowire with core radius rc surrounded by a shell of external radius rs is24,25 (1)where f = (vp + 1)/[(1 − k)(1 − 2vp)rc2 − (1 − 2vp + k)rs2], G = vp/[(rs2 − rc2) + krc2], k = Yc/Ys, vp = (vc + vs)/2, the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in the core (shell) are Yc(Ys) and vc(vs), and the radial, tangential and axial directions are denoted by r, θ and z.
 Fig. 1  Dependence of a relative change in cohesive energy on the size and Al2O3 layers for SiNWs. Inset shows the schematic illustration of a Si/Al2O3 core/shell nanowire. rc and rs are, respectively, the core and external radius of the nanowires, D = 2rc is the diameter of the core, ϕ is the barrier height of the SiNW. The arrows indicate the stress. The formation enthalpy of an interfacial bond of Si and Al2O3 is Ec–s = 2.9 eV.51 
Taking the surface and interface effects into consideration, the cohesive energy of a core/shell nanowire shown in the inset of Fig. 1 can be obtained as (2)withEcξ = Scd0Yc〈εcξ〉|〈εcξ〉|/2(1 − v)where Nic(Nc), zic(zbc) and Eci(Ecb) are the number of atoms, effective CNs and single bond energy of the ith surface layer (bulk) for the core interior, respectively. Nint is the number of interface atoms of the core. Ec–s and x denote the formation enthalpy of an interfacial bond and the molar ratio, zcr, zcθ and zcz are the effective CNs of the core in the radial, tangential and axial directions, and Sc is the cross section area of an atom.
Theoretically, the band gap of a nanowire covered with a thin epitaxial layer can be deduced as13 (3)where  and γint = 4dint(1 + εcr)/D are the average CNs and the interface-to-volume ratio, Ecgb and dint represent the band gap of the bulk and the bond length at the interface, respectively.
In order to clarify the relationship between the size, the number of epitaxial layers and the related photoelectric properties of SiNW solar cells, we consider a general case of photons with energy greater than the band gap (Eg = hpvg) of the nanostructure that produce precisely the same effect as photons with energy hpvg, while photons with lower energy will produce no effect, in which hp and vg are Planck's constant and single cutoff frequency. We further assume that the sun with the temperature Tsun = 6000 K is a perfect blackbody and the nanowire is an ideal solar cell. Thus, the influence of light loss (including reflection and transmission), resistance and leakage current in nanowire solar cells can be ignored. In light of DBP, we have9 (4)withGs = Fs − Fc0, Gc = Fc0 + R(0), Rc = Fc(V) + R(V)where Ibulk is the photocurrent of the bulk solar cell, Fs = AfwtsQsun the total rate of generation of hole–electron pairs, Fc0 = AtcQcell the blackbody radiation from the cell, Fc(V) = Fc0exp(qV/kBTcell) the rate of radiative recombination throughout the cell. R(0) and R(V) are, respectively, the nonradiative recombination and generation processes, and R(V) = R(0)exp(qV/kBTcell), where V is the voltage, ts and tc represent the probability that an incident photon with energy greater than the band gap will enter the body and produce a hole–electron pair at the sun temperature and its own temperature; fw, A, q and kB denote the geometrical factor, the area of the solar cell, electronic charge and Boltzmann's constant; Qsun and Qcell are, respectively, the number of quanta of frequency greater than vg incident per unit area per unit time for black body radiation of sun temperature (Tsun) and cell temperature (Tcell), which can be expressed by (5)with Xsun = xg = Eg/kB, Tsun, Xcell = xg/xc, xc = Tcell/Tsun where c is the light speed.
On the other hand, with the size of a solar cell down to the nanoscale, the recombination rate will increase with decreasing size as a consequence of decreased band curvature. Generally, the size-dependent recombination is essentially given by an exponential term, exp(−φ/kBTcell), where the barrier for electrons to recombine with holes amounts to φ = qNdrc2/4εd, where Nd and εd are, respectively, doping concentration and the dielectric constant, rc = D/2 is the core radius of the nanowires.14 In the case of a nanowire covered with an epitaxial layer, the recombination rate should decrease exponentially with the shell thickness (h), which can be expressed by exp(−βh/kBTcell), where β is the decay constant.20,26 Therefore, taking the combination effect from the nanowire size and the covering epitaxial layer, the recombination rate can be calculated as (6) Therefore, the current–voltage relationship is, (7)where Idsh = qGs and Id0 = qRrec are the short circuit current and reverse saturation current in the nanowires. Solving eqn (7) for the case of I = 0, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) can be obtained as follows: (8)
Therefore, combining eqn (7) and (8), we can obtain the size- and shell-dependent PCE as shown below, (9)where FF = zm2/(1 + zm − e−zm)(zm + ln(1 + zm)) is the fill factor, and the relationship between Voc and zm satisfies Voc = kBTcell (zm + ln(1 + zm))/q, and Pin is the incident power.9
Results and discussion
In order to elucidate the size and shell effects on the core–shell nanowires, we take the typical Si/Al2O3 core/shell nanowires as an example to check the validity, as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 1. The atomic structure of Al2O3 is the hexagonal close-packed crystal.27 Note that in our case we assume that the thickness of the covering layer does not reduce the strain energy enough to form a dislocation at the interface. Therefore, the influence of dislocation in core–shell nanowires can be ignored in our model.
Using eqn (3), we first calculate the size-dependent cohesive energy of the Si core with 1–3 Al2O3 layers, as shown in Fig. 1. Clearly, the cohesive energy of SiNWs decreases with a decrease in the diameter. Moreover, the cohesive energy of SiNWs can also be modulated by the coated Al2O3 layer as the surface dangling bonds are saturated. From Fig. 1, it was found that the cohesive energy of SiNWs increases with the thickness of the Al2O3 layer. It is concluded that the SiNWs coated with a shell become more stable than that of bare SiNWs.

Fig. 2 shows that the band gap of the Si core is unambiguously blue-shifted with a decrease in the diameter and the epitaxial layer of Al2O3. The physical origin can be attributed to the surface effect induced by the high less-CNs and high SVR, the interface confinement by the epitaxial layer, and the influence of self-equilibrium strain. Similarly, Park et al.28 reported that the surface dangling bond has an important influence on the band shift, and it decreases with increasing diameter and shell thickness. Fukata et al.29 revealed that the stress applied by the radial growth of the shell increases with increasing shell thickness. Our results are consistent with the experimental observations and calculations (Table 1).28–32

Fig. 3 depicts the recombination rate versus the diameter of the Si core with different numbers of Al2O3 layers. From Fig. 3, we can see that the recombination rates increase monotonically from 4.3 × 106 up to 1 × 1011 cm−2 s−1 for bare SiNWs corresponding to 100 to 1 nm in diameter, respectively, and are dependent on the shell thickness. The recombination rates of 35, 70 and 80 nm SiNWs are, respectively, 2.9 × 1010, 7.2 × 108 and 1.6 × 108 cm−2 s−1, which agree well with experimental results.4,33,34 In addition, it can be noted that the presence of different numbers of covering layers on the Si core is expected to reduce the recombination rate.19,20 Experimentally, Allen et al.35 and Dan et al.36 also demonstrated that smaller nanowires have larger surface recombination rates, and they found that SiNWs passivated by a shell can effectively reduce the recombination rate.
 Fig. 3  Dependence of recombination (Rrec) on size and Al2O3 layers for SiNWs. R(0) = 1 × 1011 cm−2 s−1 and β/kBTc = 1.6 nm−1 are, respectively, obtained by using Voc = 0.402 eV for the 35 nm SiNW from ref. 4 and PCE for different Al2O3 epitaxial layers from ref. 44 based on eqn (8). The symbols denote the data for bare SiNWs, which can be obtained by Rrec = Id0/q. 

Fig. 4(a) shows size-dependent Idsh for different numbers of Al2O3 layers. Clearly, Idsh initially exhibits a slow decrease with decreasing size and then reduces rapidly as the size becomes less than 10 nm. Also, Idsh increases with the shell thickness. This trend is expected since the surface bond is passivated due to the existence of the shell, which reduces the band gap and the recombination rate. Remarkably, the influences of the shell on Idsh become smaller with increasing diameter. Fig. 4(b) shows the plot of Voc as a function of diameter, which initially shows a slow decrease with decreasing size and then decreases rapidly as the size becomes less than about 5 nm. The complex trend in Voc is best explained by considering two regions: (i) a diameter larger than 5 nm. In this region, shrinking of the dimensions will diminish surface barriers and enhance the recombination rate. The results show that the Voc is determined by the barrier. (ii) a diameter less than 5 nm. Upon shrinking the size to a few nanometers, the Idsh and the recombination rate exhibit, respectively, a rapid decrease and increase with increasing band gap. It is concluded that the Voc for a small-size nanostructure is mainly determined by the band mechanism. Moreover, the tunability of Voc can be achieved by coating a thin shell on the SiNWs. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the Voc increases with increasing Al2O3 epitaxial layer. Christesen et al.37 reported that upon surface recombination velocities change from 105 to 0 cm s−1 and the Voc increases by 75%, and they also found that the Voc of radial junction SiNWs is larger than that of axial junction SiNWs. Importantly, our predictions are very consistent with the experimental results and simulations.4,33,34,38–41

The inset of (a) shows a magnified area. The symbols cited from the literature denote the data for bare SiNWs. ref. 33 (blue diamond), ref. 34 (red diamond), ref. 38 (magenta diamond), ref. 39 (green diamond), ref. 40 (black circle), ref. 41 (blue square), ref. 43 (black square). 
Furthermore, the η as a function of diameter is plotted in Fig. 4(c). It is seen that the η curves are similar to the Voc. In fact, increasing the size of SiNWs can improve the recombination barrier and recombination resistance, which reduces the recombination rate and enhances η. Thus, the η of SiNWs is mainly affected by the recombination rate. Evidently, the general trends of our predictions are in accord with some experimental results and numerical simulations.33,34,38–43 In addition, the PCE of SiNWs increases with the increase in shell thickness. Li et al.44 reported the PCE of 7.30%, 7.37%, 7.39%, and 7.80% for SiNWs with 0, 3, 5, 7 Al2O3 layers, respectively. Strikingly, we find that when the diameter of SiNWs is smaller than 5 nm, the PCE shows a remarkable increase when coated by one layer of Al2O3. Moreover, many experimental results have shown that the PCE initially increases with increasing shell size and then decreases.44,45 The reason for the decrease may be attributed to the effect of dislocation on Idsh and the recombination rate. Noticeably, in our case, we focus on the Si/Al2O3 core/shell nanowires and explore the underlying mechanism of the interface confinement and enhanced conversion efficiency in Si nanowire solar cells. Also, the atomic-bond-relaxation method can be effectively used for compound systems, such as ZnO/Si, ZnO/ZnS and CdSe/ZnSe46
Conclusion
In summary, we have established an analytic solution regarding the photoelectric properties of SiNW solar cells under interface confinement based on the combination of ABR consideration and DBP. Theoretical studies enabled the understanding of the atomistic origin of the photoelectric properties of SiNW solar cells under interface confinement. It can be concluded that the interface mismatch strain is the most important parameter affecting the photoelectric properties of interior nanowires. Our results agree reasonably well with the experimental measurements and numerical simulations, suggesting that the proposed method could be a general approach to deal with the photoelectric properties of nanostructures.

 	Fig. 3  Dependence of recombination (Rrec) on size and Al2O3 layers for SiNWs. R(0) = 1 × 1011 cm−2 s−1 and β/kBTc = 1.6 nm−1 are, respectively, obtained by using Voc = 0.402 eV for the 35 nm SiNW from ref. 4 and PCE for different Al2O3 epitaxial layers from ref. 44 based on eqn (8). The symbols denote the data for bare SiNWs, which can be obtained by Rrec = Id0/q.
