    , Accepted 20th September 2022First published on 21st September 2022AbstractThe stability of Sn-based perovskites has always been the main obstacle to their application. Interface engineering is a very effective method for improving the stability of perovskites and the efficiency of batteries. Two-dimensional (2D) monolayer SnS is selected as a surface-covering layer for the CsSnI3 lead-free perovskite. The structure, electronic properties, and stability of the CsSnI3–SnS heterostructure are studied using density functional theory. Due to the different contact interfaces (SnI2 and CsI interfaces) of CsSnI3, the interface electronic-transmission characteristics are inconsistent in the CsSnI3–SnS heterostructure. Because of the difference in work functions, electrons flow at the interface of the heterostructure, forming a built-in electric field. The heterostructures form a type-I energy-level arrangement. Under the action of an electric field in the CsI–SnS heterostructure, electrons at the CsI interface recombine with holes at the SnS interface; however, the holes of the SnI2 interface and the electrons of the SnS interface are easily recombined in the SnI2–SnS heterostructure. Moreover, monolayer SnS can enhance the light absorption of the CsSnI3–SnS heterostructure. Monolayer SnS can inhibit the migration of iodine ions and effectively improve the structural stability of the SnI2–SnS interface heterostructure. This work provides a new theoretical basis for improving the stability of lead-free perovskites.
Introduction
In recent years, perovskite solar cells have been shown to have the advantages of high conversion efficiencies, low manufacturing costs and low energy consumption, which is expected to break the current monopoly of silicon solar cells. Since 2013, Grätzel's work has made a breakthrough in the conversion efficiency of perovskites, setting off an upsurge in perovskite research.1 In 2009, Kojima et al. used a perovskite as a solar-cell material with an efficiency of only 3.8% at that time.2 So far, the highest efficiency of single-junction perovskite solar cells released by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has exceeded 25.5%,3 which is almost comparable to the efficiency of commercial silicon solar cells. Although organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have achieved an impressive performance, their instability to humidity and temperature remains one of the key challenges that hinder the commercial development of perovskite solar cells.4–6 In addition, the toxicity of lead-based perovskites also limits their commercial application and promotion.7,8 Using Sn, Ge, Bi and Ag instead of Pd and Cs to replace the organic cation is a feasible means of solving the stability and toxicity issues of perovskite materials.
Black orthonormal (B-γ) CsSnI3 is a type of non-lead perovskite material that has excellent optical properties. Recently, Ye and collaborators studied the localized electron density and limited the oxidation of CsSnI3 using phthalimide (PTM) additives. The most effective efficiency of the prepared perovskite solar cell reached 10.1%.9 Similarly, Li et al. adopted the thiosemicarbazide (TSC) passivation strategy to adjust the defect density of states on the surface and at the grain boundary of the CsSnI3 perovskite, and the power conversion efficiency of the prepared perovskite cell reached 8.20%.10 These examples show that the passivation strategy on a perovskite surface is an effective means of reducing the defect density of states and improving the perovskite efficiency.
2D materials such as graphene and black phosphorus have excellent optical, mechanical and electrical properties.11–13 Wang and co-workers doped chemically modified graphene into the electron-transport layer, enhanced the ability of SnO2 to extract and transport electrons, and obtained perovskite solar cells with a fill factor of 82% and an efficiency of 20.2%.14 Zhang et al. obtained photodetectors with excellent performance characteristics using all-inorganic halide perovskite CsPbI3−xBrx quantum dots and single-layer MoS2. The corresponding phototransistor showed a high light response rate of 7.7 × 104 A W−1 and an external quantum efficiency of over 107%.15 Huang et al. combined 2D TiS2 and SnO2 in a double structure, adjusting the energy-level matching of the electron-transport layer, reducing the electron defect density of states, and increasing the maximum efficiency of solar cells from 18.46% to 21.73%.16 In short, the introduction of 2D materials at the interface of perovskite materials is of great significance for reducing the density of defect states and improving the long-term stability of materials as well as the device efficiency.
Tin sulfide (SnS) is a p-type semiconductor that exhibits the properties of a large optical absorption coefficient, an appropriate optical band gap, and excellent carrier mobility;17,18 therefore, it is very suitable for photocatalysts and optoelectronic devices.19,20 Yuan et al. used an SnS:ZnS photoactive layer to expand the spectral absorption range of the CsPbBr3 halide from 550 nm to 700 nm, reduce the defects on the film surface, improve the charge, and obtain an inorganic perovskite solar cell with an efficiency of 10.26%.21 Ouyang et al. used SnS instead of bathocuproine (BCP) as the intermediate layer material of an inverted perovskite for electron collection. After optimization, the efficiency of the device reached 18.40% and showed good device stability.22 Single-layer SnS has similar photoelectric properties to bulk SnS. In addition, due to its thin atomic-layer thickness, it is easy to adjust the properties of single-layer SnS using strain, an electric field, physical adsorption, and chemical means.23,24
Based on the features, the CsSnI3–SnS heterostructure is constructed to study the photoelectric properties and stability using first-principles calculations. The CsSnI3–SnS heterostructure has two kinds of interface contacts (the CsI–SnS interface and the SnI2–SnS interface), and the interface properties are different for the different interface contact types. Our results reveal the interface electron-transfer characteristics and the light-absorption characteristics. The interface stability is studied via the migration of I ions and the bonding characteristics of the interface.
Calculation methods and models
This work adopts the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) software, which is developed under the framework of density functional theory (DFT).25 The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method is adopted for interactions between electrons and ion nuclei to be convenient and quick. For semiconductors and insulators, the selected HSE hybrid functional is more accurate than the PBE functional in calculation of the crystal properties, especially in the band structures. Therefore, the crystal structure of CsSnI3 is optimized using the PBE method, and crystal parameters are obtained that are consistent with the experimental values. The band structure of the CsSnI3–SnS heterojunction is calculated using the PBE and HSE hybrid functional method. The plane-wave cutoff for this calculation is 320 eV. The Brillouin region (BZ) was sampled using a grid of 2 × 2 × 1 K points from the Gamma scatter point. Since the CsSnI3 section structure is studied, the vacuum layer with a thickness of 15 Å is added in the Z direction. A correlation dispersion term (DFT-D2) is added to the functional to relax the CsSnI3–SnS heterostructure. For self-consistent crystal-structure convergence, the stress on the atoms is set to be less than 0.02 eV Å−1, and the energy difference of the system is less than 1 × 10−4 eV.
Results and discussion
The calculated lattice parameters of the CsSnI3 bulk are a = 8.91 Å, b = 8.69 Å, and c = 12.54 Å, and those of the SnS monolayer are a = 4.25 Å, and b = 4.09 Å, which are same as those reported from the experimental and theoretical studies of other groups.26–28 A single layer of SnS is stacked on a CsSnI3 slab with 9 atomic layers. The lattice parameters of the CsSnI3–SnS heterostructure system are a = 12.50 Å, b = 12.46 Å, and c = 50 Å. Both the CsI interface and the SnI2 interface of CsSnI3 are selected to build the CsSnI3–SnS heterostructures. The CsSnI3–SnS heterostructures are constructed using 1 × 1 CsSnI3 and a 3 × 3 (rotation between surfaces 46°) SnS monolayer. The lattice mismatch of the CsSnI3–SnS heterostructure is 1.2%. The relaxed CsI/SnS and SnI2/SnS heterostructures are shown in Fig. 1. The shapes of the CsSnI3 slab and single-layer SnS are well maintained and the octahedra of SnI6 deform slightly in the interface area.

The relaxed vertical interlayer distances of the CsI–SnS interface and the SnI2–SnS interface are 3.81 Å and 2.74 Å, respectively. Under the influence of stress and strain, the heterogeneous structure may cause crystal expansion and interface distortion. Because the structural parameters change little and the relative positions of the atoms do not change, the inherent properties of a single component can be retained in the heterostructure. The interface binding energy values are calculated to judge the stability of the heterostructure. The formula for the binding energy isEb = Eher. − ECsSnI3 − ESnSwhere Eher., ECsSnI3 and ESnS are the energy values of the heterostructure, CsSnI3 and SnS monolayer, respectively. The lower the binding energy, the easier the heterostructure is to form. The binding energies of the CsI/SnS and SnI2/SnS heterostructures are −0.235 eV and −0.398 eV, respectively. The results show that the energies are very low and the values are negative. Therefore, the heterostructure can be spontaneously constructed in theory. Furthermore, a molecular dynamics simulation is carried out for the CsI/SnS and SnI2/SnS heterostructures, and the results are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The results show that the SnI2/SnS heterostructure is more stable than the CsI/SnS heterostructure at room temperature.
The research articles of Shah et al. and Blaha et al. show that the spin–orbit coupling of CsSnI3 is not considered, and that the spin–orbit effect has a small impact on these materials. Therefore, we do not consider the spin–orbit coupling when calculating the band structures.29,30 The calculated band gaps using the PBE functional of the CsSnI3 bulk and the SnS bulk are 0.83 eV and 0.98 eV, and the calculated band gaps using the HSE06 functional for these are 1.28 eV and 1.19 eV, respectively. Experimental band gaps of the CsSnI3 bulk and the SnS bulk are 1.3 eV,27 and 1.3 eV,31 respectively, as shown in Table S2 (ESI†). Therefore, the calculated band gaps using the HSE06 functional are in good agreement with the experimental values, and the energy band and light absorption are therefore calculated using the HSE06 functional.
Semiconductor band alignment plays an important role in the application of electronic devices. The band alignment of the interfaces depends on the charge transfer of materials on both sides. The energy-level diagrams of the CsI–SnS and SnI2–SnS heterostructures before and after contact are shown in Fig. 2(a)–(d), and the band structures are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The band-gap changes of calculated CsSnI3 and SnS are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). In the pre-contact states of the CsI–SnS heterostructure, the conduction band minimum (CBM) level and the valence band maximum (VBM) of the SnS monolayer are lower than that of the CsI interface. Therefore, electrons spontaneously flow from the CsI interface to SnS from the bottom of the conduction band, and the holes spontaneously flow from SnS to CsI from the top of the valence band. The band edge of the CsI interface is curved upwards and that of the SnS monolayer is curved downwards. Electrons and holes are distributed in different concentrations near the heterostructure, resulting in a built-in electric field. The direction of the built-in electric field is from the CsI interface to the SnS interface. After the CsI interface and SnS interface contact, the Fermi level is unified and the heterostructure forms a type-I energy-level arrangement. The electrons of the CsI interface and the holes of the SnS interface are easily recombined under the drive of the built-in electric field. In the pre-contact states of the SnI2–SnS heterostructure, the CBM and the VBM of the SnI2 interface are lower than that of the SnS monolayer. Therefore, the movement direction of electrons and holes is opposite, and the direction of the band bending is opposite to that of the CsI–SnS heterostructure. After the SnI2 interface and SnS interface contact, the electrons of the SnS interface and the holes of the SnI2 interface are easily recombined under the drive of the built-in electric field.

The heights of the green and yellow rectangles represent the size of the band gaps of SnS and the perovskite material, respectively. The vacuum energy level (EV) was set to the reference frame with a value of 0. After contact, the Fermi level (EF) was used as the reference frame, and its value is 0. 
The work function (WF) is defined as the energy required for an electron to escape exactly from the interior of a solid to the surface, and can be expressed as the difference between the vacuum energy level and the Fermi energy level. The work function calculated for each part of the heterojunction is shown in Table 1. The difference in the WF will lead to the spontaneous flow of electrons and holes in the heterostructure. The WF of the SnS monolayer is between the CsI interface and the SnI2 interface. When the CsI interface and the SnI2 interface make contact with the SnS monolayer, the electrons of the CsI interface and the SnI2 interface will move in opposite directions. The electrons are moving from a lower WF to a higher WF. Therefore, electrons move from the CsI interface to the SnS monolayer in the CsI–SnS heterostructure, and move from the SnS monolayer to the SnI2 interface in the SnI2–SnS heterostructure.

To clarify the detailed properties of charge transfer at the interface of the CsSnI3–SnS heterostructure, we study the three-dimensional plane-averaged charge-density difference and the charge-density difference perpendicular to the plane direction of the heterostructure, as shown in Fig. 3(a–d) respectively. The calculation formula isΔρ = ρtot − ρCsSnI3 − ρSnSwhere ρtot, ρCsSnI3 and ρSnS are the plane-averaged densities of the total CsSnI3–SnS heterostructure, free-standing CsSnI3 slabs, and the SnS monolayer, which are calculated by fixing the position of the atoms of each component in the system. The positive and negative charges are equal throughout the model. The closer Δρ(z) is to the heterogeneous interface, the stronger the fluctuation is, and the farther it is, the more the value tends to 0. In Fig. 3, the yellow areas represent the concentration of electrons, and the blue areas represent the concentration of holes. It shows that the transfer of charges occurs mainly at the interface in the heterostructure. Electrons gather at the SnS monolayer, and holes gather in the CsI–SnS heterostructure. By contrast, the electrons mainly gather at the SnI2 interface, and holes gather at the SnS monolayer in the SnI2–SnS heterostructure. As different kinds of carriers gather at the interfaces at both ends of the heterojunction, the built-in electric field is formed, and the direction is from the direction of hole aggregation to the direction of electron aggregation. The region of electron accumulation and diffusion is the same as the analysis result of the energy-level diagram above.

The reference value of the level isosurface is 5 × 10−4 e Å−3. The yellow region indicates that the electrons are moving into the region, and similarly, the blue region indicates that the electrons are moving out of the region. The black vertical dotted lines correspond to the corresponding positions of the atomic layers. 
It is necessary to clarify the influence of the heterostructure on the optical properties because they are very important for the application of optoelectronic devices. The absorption spectra of the CsI interface, the SnI2 interface, the SnS monolayer, and their heterostructures are plotted in Fig. 4. The formula for the simulated absorption spectrum is as follows:  where α is the absorption coefficient, and ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, respectively, where the dependent variable is the frequency of light ω. As shown in Fig. 4, compared with the CsSnI3 slab, the light absorption of the two types of heterostructure is enhanced from the visible to the ultraviolet region. This shows that CsSnI3–SnS has a better light-absorption capacity and potential for optoelectronic applications.

It is well known that ion migration is one of the important reasons for the decomposition of perovskites.32,33 Eames et al. estimated the migration activation energy of different kinds of ions in perovskite materials based on first principles, and confirmed that organic cations and halogen anions are prone to migration, whereas metal cations are not.34 In addition, other experimental evidence shows that iodine ions in perovskite materials can migrate at room temperature.35,36 The higher the iodine–ion migration barrier, the more stable the perovskite surface. Therefore, we studied and compared the I–ion migration barrier when I–ion vacancies appeared on the surface of the CsSnI3 slab and CsSnI3–SnS heterostructures, as shown in Fig. 5. At the CsI interface and the CsI–SnS heterostructure, the migration barriers of iodine ions remain largely unchanged, which is around 280 meV. However, the iodine–ion migration barrier in the SnI2–SnS heterostructure is 190 meV, which is significantly higher than the SnI2 interface (130 meV). Therefore, the monolayer SnS covering can inhibit the migration of iodine ions.

The red/black line represents the total energy change of the system during the migration of I ions on the surface of the CsSnI3 slab/CsSnI3–SnS heterostructures. 
The total density of states (DOS) and the DOS of interfacial atomic states are displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†) to show the interfacial atomic interactions. It shows that the interfacial atomic orbitals overlap, particularly the Sn and S orbitals in the SnI2–SnS heterostructure. This result implies that the two interfaces are coupling. The crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) can quantitatively analyze the covalent-bond strength. The COHP reflects the partitioned orbital–pair interaction, and the larger its negative integrated value (–ICOHP), the stronger the covalent-bond strength.37 For the SnI2–SnS heterostructure, the –ICOHP value of the Sn–I bond at the SnI2 interface is 0.73 eV and the Sn–S bond at the SnI2 and SnS interface is 1.80 eV. The corresponding Sn–I bond length is 3.44 Å and the Sn–S bond length is 2.86 Å. This result indicates that the bond strength of Sn–S at the interface is higher than that of Sn–I in the perovskite. Moreover, the SnS monolayer forms a covalent bond with the SnI2 interface that can isolate the influence of the external environment on the CsSnI3 perovskite to a certain extent to improve the stability.
Conclusion
In summary, the electronic and optical properties, and the interfacial stability of the CsSnI3–SnS heterostructure were studied using first-principles calculations. The CsSnI3–SnS heterostructure shows a type-I energy-level arrangement. The work function of different materials is different, and the driving electrons move spontaneously at the interface of the heterojunction, forming a built-in electric field. In the CsI–SnS heterostructure, due to the role of a built-in electric field, the electrons of the CsI interface and the holes of the SnS interface are easily recombined; however, the holes of the SnI2 interface and the electrons of the SnS interface are easily recombined in the SnI2–SnS heterostructure. Moreover, monolayer SnS can enhance the light absorption of the CsSnI3–SnS heterostructure. Monolayer SnS can increase the migration barrier of iodide ions, which helps stabilize the octahedral structure of the CsSnI3 perovskite. Moreover, the SnS monolayer forms a covalent bond with the SnI2 interface that can improve the environmental stability of CsSnI3. This work could provide useful insight for effectively improving the performance and stability of lead-free perovskites.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) and (b) Top views of the interface heterojunctions, and (c) and (d) side views of the interface heterostructures. The distance of vacuum space is set to 15 Å. Sphere colors in the crystal diagram: green, Cs; gray, Sn; purple, I; and yellow, S.	 
Eb = Eher. − ECsSnI3 − ESnS

 	Fig. 2  Energy-level diagrams of the SnS monolayer with the (a) CsI interface and (b) SnI2 interface, and the (c) CsI–SnS and (d) SnI2–SnS heterostructures. The heights of the green and yellow rectangles represent the size of the band gaps of SnS and the perovskite material, respectively. The vacuum energy level (EV) was set to the reference frame with a value of 0. After contact, the Fermi level (EF) was used as the reference frame, and its value is 0.	 

SnS monolayer	−3.87	0.97	4.84
CsI interface	−0.84	3.15	3.99
SnI2 interface	−1.65	3.89	5.54
Δρ = ρtot − ρCsSnI3 − ρSnS

 	Fig. 3  Three-dimensional plane-averaged charge-density difference of the (a) CsI interface heterostructure and (b) SnI2 interface heterostructure; the charge–density difference of the (c) CsI interface heterostructure and (d) SnI2 interface heterostructure. The reference value of the level isosurface is 5 × 10−4 e Å−3. The yellow region indicates that the electrons are moving into the region, and similarly, the blue region indicates that the electrons are moving out of the region. The black vertical dotted lines correspond to the corresponding positions of the atomic layers.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Absorption spectra of the CsI–SnS interface heterostructure and their components. (b) Absorption spectra of the SnI2–SnS interface heterostructure and their components. Absorption spectra line colors: blue, SnS monolayer; red, CsI or SnI2 interface; black, CsI–SnS or SnI2–SnS interface heterostructure.	 

 	Fig. 5  Energy-barrier diagrams of iodine-ion transitions on the surfaces of (a) CsI and the CsI–SnS heterojunction, and (b) SnI2 and the SnI2–SnS heterojunction. The red/black line represents the total energy change of the system during the migration of I ions on the surface of the CsSnI3 slab/CsSnI3–SnS heterostructures.
