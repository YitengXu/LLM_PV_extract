    , Accepted 12th April 2018First published on 12th April 2018AbstractCoupling two semiconductors together to construct a Z-scheme type photocatalytic system is an efficient strategy to solve the serious recombination challenge of photogenerated electrons and holes. In this work, we develop a novel composite photocatalyst by sandwiching metallic 1T-phase MoS2 nanosheets between MoO3 and g-C3N4 (MoO3/1T-MoS2/g-C3N4) for the first time. The metallic 1T-phase MoS2 acts as an efficient electron mediator between MoO3 and g-C3N4 to construct an all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic system, resulting in a highly-efficient spatial charge separation and transfer process. Benefiting from this, the newly developed MoO3/1T-MoS2/g-C3N4 exhibits a drastically enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 513.0 μmol h−1 g−1 under visible light irradiation (>420 nm), which is nearly 12 times higher than that of the pure g-C3N4 (39.5 μmol h−1 g−1), and 3.5 times higher than that of MoO3/g-C3N4 (145.7 μmol h−1 g−1). More importantly, the originally unstable 1T-phase MoS2 becomes very stable in MoO3/1T-MoS2/g-C3N4 because of the sandwich structure where 1T-phase MoS2 is protected by MoO3 and g-C3N4, which endows the photocatalyst with excellent photostability. It is believed that this study will provide new insights into the design of efficient and stable Z-scheme heterostructures for photocatalytic applications.
1. Introduction
In recent years, the energy crisis and environmental pollution have aroused growing concerns around the world.1 Photocatalytic water-splitting over semiconductors has received much attention due to its great potential to produce H2 by using solar energy, the most abundant renewable energy.2 Since Wang's pioneering work,3 a metal-free graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) photocatalyst has attracted tremendous attention due to its extraordinary features.4–6 However, the applications of pure g-C3N4 are limited mainly because of the fast electron–hole recombination rate, resulting in its low quantum efficiency.7 Hence, great efforts have been made to improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4.8–17 Among these strategies, the construction of g-C3N4-based heterostructures has attracted the most attention, which is believed to facilitate the spatial separation and transfer of the photogenerated electrons and holes.18,19
Recently, there has been increasing interest in the design of Z-scheme photocatalytic systems. For instance, Hsu et al. constructed NaxH2−xTi3O7-Au-Cu2O Z-scheme nanoheterostructures and found that the ternary composites achieved much higher photocatalytic activity for methylene blue photodegradation than their individual constituents and binary counterparts.20 Subsequently, they demonstrated the use of ZnO-Au-SnO2 heterostructure nanorods as the Z-scheme photoanode for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting.21 In a Z-scheme system, the photogenerated electrons and holes can be effectively separated while the strong redox potential of the photogenerated charge carriers can be retained, which overcomes the disadvantage of the traditional type-II heterogeneous photocatalytic systems where the redox potential of the transferred electrons/holes is greatly reduced due to the release of a portion of the potential energy.22,23 Therefore, constructing a Z-scheme photocatalytic system based on g-C3N4 is a promising strategy to improve the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that an all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic system employing conductors, such as Au or Pt, as the electron mediators, shows a higher ability of charge migration than a direct Z-scheme system without conductors owing to the difference in their electrical resistances.22 However, embedding such metal particles into the interfaces of two semiconductors as the electron mediators could only result in a limited point-contact between the metal particles and the two semiconductors, which inevitably leads to an unsmooth flow of electrons from one semiconductor to the other through the metal mediators. Thus, it is still a great challenge to construct an all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic system in which the electron mediator can come into close contact with two semiconductors with a large contact surface to achieve a fast photogenerated charge transfer.
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has received a great deal of attention for its potential application as a promising electrocatalyst for H2 evolution and has been considered as a promising alternative for noble-metal co-catalysts due to its abundance and low cost.24–26 Generally, MoS2 exists in three different polymorphs, including 1T, 2H and 3R polymorphs.27 Natural MoS2 usually exists in the stable 2H phase, showing semiconducting properties with a tunable bandgap of 1.3–1.9 eV. It can be transformed into the unstable yet metallic 1T-phase MoS2 with unique properties under certain conditions.28 It has been reported that single-layered 1T-MoS2 has extraordinary photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction (HER) activity.29–31 Moreover, the 1T-MoS2 has also been employed as a highly efficient co-catalyst for photocatalytic application.32,33 Since the metallic 1T-phase MoS2 possesses a much higher conductivity than the semiconducting 2H-phase MoS2,34 it is thus anticipated that the metallic 1T-phase MoS2 may serve as an electron mediator in the Z-scheme heterostructure design. However, there is no literature reporting the intentional use of metallic 1T-phase MoS2 for the Z-scheme photocatalytic system design to date.
In this work, we report an innovative Z-scheme heterostructure by taking advantage of the metallic feature of MoS2. A two-step procedure is used to design a new type of photocatalyst MoO3/MoS2/g-C3N4 where 1T-phase 2D MoS2 plays an important role as a solid phase electron mediator. Firstly, we prepare MoO3/g-C3N4 composites by a facile calcination method, through which MoO3 particles can be homogeneously embedded in the g-C3N4 nanosheets, forming a direct Z-scheme heterojunction. Secondly, we intentionally transform the MoO3 nanoparticles into metallic 1T-phase MoS2 nanosheets using an in situ partial sulfuration process in the presence of thiourea. This process subsequently leads to the formation of an all-solid Z-scheme photocatalytic system with close contact between the metallic MoS2 mediator and the two semiconductors (MoO3 and g-C3N4). The newly designed composite photocatalyst not only exhibits drastically improved photocatalytic water-splitting performance, but also demonstrates much better stability because of the unique sandwiched MoO3/MoS2/g-C3N4 structure.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation of photocatalysts

Preparation of g-C3N4. 
g-C3N4 was obtained by the calcination of dicyandiamide (DCDA). In detail, 5 g of DCDA was placed in a covered ceramic crucible and then heated in a muffle furnace in air at 550 °C for 4 h at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. After naturally cooling to room temperature, the product was ground into a powder, resulting in g-C3N4.


Preparation of MoO3/g-C3N4 composites. 
Typically, 3 g of DCDA and 50 mg of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate were added to 10 mL of ethanol and well dispersed by ultrasonic treatment. After being dried at 80 °C, the mixture was milled, and then placed into a covered ceramic crucible and heated in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for 4 h at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained MoO3/g-C3N4 (CNMO) was ground into a powder.


Preparation of MoO3/MoS2/g-C3N4 composites. 
MoO3/MoS2/g-C3N4 was prepared by in situ sulfuration of MoO3/g-C3N4. In detail, 200 mg of MoO3/g-C3N4 was added to 20 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and well dispersed by ultrasonic treatment. Then different amounts of thiourea (1.65, 2.48, 4.96, 9.92, and 14.88 mg) and hydroxylamine hydrochloride (3.33, 5, 10, 20, and 30 mg) were added to the above solution (the ratio between the two components is about 1:2). The thiourea acted as the sulfur precursor, and the hydroxylamine hydrochloride was the reducing agent. The solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 200 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the products were centrifuged and washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and then were dried at 80 °C for 4 h in an oven, resulting in MoO3/MoS2/g-C3N4 (CNMS). The obtained corresponding products were denoted CNMS-1, CNMS-2, CNMS-3, CNMS-4 and CNMS-5, respectively. The schematic illustration of the preparation method of CNMS is shown in Scheme 1.

2.2 Characterization
X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained with a Bruker D2 Phaser using Cu/Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained with a JEOL JEM2100 TEM. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were conducted with a Quantachrome at liquid N2 temperature. The specific area was determined from the linear portion of the BET plot. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out using a PHI5300 analyzer with aluminum Kα radiation. Ultraviolet–visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was performed by using a V-670 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded with a FLS980 spectrometer at room temperature using a 350 nm excitation wavelength.
2.3 Photocatalytic measurements
The photocatalytic water-splitting reaction was carried out in a top-irradiation quartz cell connected to a closed glass gas circulation system (CEL-SPH2N, Beijing). In a photocatalytic reaction, 10 mg of the sample was dispersed in a 20 mL aqueous solution containing 10% triethanolamine as the sacrificial agent. 3 wt% Pt was photodeposited on the photocatalysts using H2PtCl6 dissolved in the reactant solution. The suspension was thoroughly evacuated and then irradiated by using a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300) with a 420 nm cutoff filter. The temperature of the reaction solution was maintained at 6 °C by a flow of cooling water during the photocatalytic reaction. The H2 evolved was analyzed with an on-line TCD gas chromatograph (GC-9720, nitrogen carrier).
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using an electrochemical station (CHI 660E) in a standard three-electrode quartz cell equipped with a working electrode, a platinum sheet as the counter electrode and a saturation calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The working electrode was prepared as follows: 5 mg of the samples was suspended in 0.5 mL of deionized water with 0.05 mL of 5 wt% Nafion D-520 dispersion, and then the mixture was dispersed by ultrasonication and spread onto FTO glass. After being dried naturally, the FTO glass was heated at 120 °C for 1 h to evaporate the solvent. 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. A 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300) with a 420 nm filter was used as the light source.
2.5 Analysis of hydroxyl radicals
Hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) formed on the surface of the illuminated samples were detected by the PL method using terephthalic acid (TA) as a probe molecule. In a typical procedure, 10 mg of the sample was dispersed in a 20 mL aqueous solution of 5 × 10−4 M TA and 2 × 10−3 M NaOH. EDTA-Na2 and p-benzoquinone were added as the h+ scavenger and ˙O2− scavenger, respectively. The irradiation was then carried out using a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300) equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter and the sampling was performed for 15 min. The solution was analyzed after filtration using a FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 315 nm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and crystal structure
The morphology of the g-C3N4, CNMO and CNMS samples was investigated by TEM and HRTEM. Fig. S1† shows the micron-sized bulk morphology of the as-prepared g-C3N4. In contrast, the g-C3N4 in the CNMO composites displays a sheet-like structure with many disordered nanopores (Fig. 1a), which can be ascribed to the ammonia produced by the decomposition of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate due to the calcination treatment. The MoO3 nanoparticles are fully wrapped by the g-C3N4 nanosheets (the inset in Fig. 1a), resulting in close contact between the two semiconductors, which can also be confirmed by the HRTEM image of CNMO shown in Fig. 1b. Such a heterostructure with close contact interfaces ensures the fast separation and transfer of charge carriers across the interfaces. The content of MoO3 was 4.6 wt% determined by SEM-EDS characterization. To further improve the charge transfer ability, MoS2 was in situ produced on the interfaces between MoO3 and g-C3N4 by the partial sulfuration of MoO3. According to the XPS results, the contents of MoS2 were 0.67 wt%, 0.71 wt%, 0.80 wt%, 0.99 wt% and 1.14 wt% for the CNMS-1, CNMS-2, CNMS-3, CNMS-4 and CNMS-5 samples, respectively. Fig. 1c–e present the HRTEM images of CNMS-1, CNMS-2 and CNMS-5, respectively, confirming that the MoS2 nanosheets have been formed between MoO3 and g-C3N4. From the zoomed-in HRTEM image (the inset) of CNMS-1 shown in Fig. 1c, the honeycomb-like lattice areas of trigonal prismatic coordination can be observed, which can be assigned to the 2H-phase MoS2.35 Meanwhile, the 1T-phase MoS2 can be clearly visualized in CNMS-2 and CNMS-5 (Fig. 1d and e), as well as CNMS-3 and CNMS-4 (Fig. S2†), evidently displaying the trigonal lattice areas (octahedral coordination) of the 1T phase.36 The variations can be ascribed to the gradual transformation of the 2H-phase MoS2 to the 1T-phase MoS2 with the increasing amount of thiourea and hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Fig. S3† shows the intensity profile recorded along the green lines as marked in Fig. 1c and d for the 2H-phase MoS2 and 1T-phase MoS2, respectively, and the normalized intensity profiles are shown in Fig. 1f. Due to the overlap of the two sulfur atoms along the electron beam direction, only one S site is observed between the two Mo sites in the 2H-phase MoS2 in Fig. 1f. On the other hand, for the 1T-phase MoS2, the two S sites are distributed along the longest Mo–Mo bonds forming a structure with distorted octahedral coordination. The variations in the signal intensity show clear differences for the two structures, further confirming the existence of two different phases of MoS2.36 Moreover, obvious differences can be found in the CNMS samples in terms of the morphology of the MoS2. For the CNMS-1, CNMS-2 and CNMS-3 samples, only the partial edge of MoO3 was transformed to MoS2, while almost all the outer surface of the whole MoO3 nanoparticles in the CNMS-4 and CNMS-5 samples was covered with MoS2, indicating a deeper extent of sulfuration. The sandwich-like structure of the CNMS samples provides a close connection between MoS2 and the two semiconductors (MoO3 and g-C3N4), which creates a highly efficient pathway for electron transport across their interfaces in the Z-scheme photocatalytic system.

The XRD patterns of the g-C3N4, CNMO and CNMS samples are shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2a, the diffraction peaks of g-C3N4 at 13.0° and 27.4° can be assigned to the (100) and (002) crystal planes of the graphitic materials, which are assigned to the inter-layer structural packing and the interplanar stacking peaks of the aromatic systems, respectively, corresponding to the graphite-like hexagonal phase of g-C3N4 (JCPDS 87-1526).3 It is found that all the diffraction peaks of CNMO and CNMS samples are indexed to be the g-C3N4 phase, while no peaks correlated with MoO3 or MoS2 are observed due to the low concentration of MoO3 (about 5.6 wt%) and MoS2 in the composites. Fig. 2b demonstrates that the (002) diffraction peaks of the CNMO and CNMS samples all shift to lower angles compared with pure g-C3N4, signifying an increased interlayer spacing.37 This result indicates that the bulk g-C3N4 could be exfoliated into g-C3N4 nanosheets during the thermal treatment of the mixture of dicyandiamide and ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate, which was consistent with the TEM image of CNMO (Fig. 1a). In addition, the strong interaction between g-C3N4 and MoO3 may also contribute to the shift of the (002) diffraction peak. A similar result has been found in a previous report that the coupling of g-C3N4 and MoO3 led to the shift of diffraction peaks.38

3.2 Surface chemical states and compositions
XPS measurements were carried out to investigate the surface chemical composition and chemical states of the elements. Fig. 3a indicates that the CNMS-2 sample consists of C, N, O, Mo, and S elements. Two peaks centered at 288.4 and 284.8 eV appear in the XPS spectrum of C 1s for both g-C3N4 and CNMS-2 samples (Fig. 3b), which can be ascribed to the sp2-bonded carbon (N–CN) in the s-triazine rings and the sp2 C–C bonds derived from the graphitic carbon in the carbon nitride matrix, respectively.39,40Fig. 3c shows the XPS spectrum of N 1s for the CNMS-2 sample with three peaks located at 400.8, 400.0 and 398.8 eV, corresponding to the amino groups (C–N–H), tertiary nitrogen N–(C)3 groups and the sp2-bonded N (C–NC) in g-C3N4, respectively.39,41,42 Notably, the binding energy of N 1s of the CNMS-2 sample exhibits a shift towards a stronger binding energy in comparison with that of g-C3N4, which can be ascribed to the interaction between MoO3 and g-C3N4 or between MoS2 and g-C3N4. Similar results have been found in ref. 38 that the N 1s peak showed a shift resulting from the interaction between MoO3 and g-C3N4. Another research study demonstrated that the interaction between Bi and N atoms in a g-C3N4/BiPO4 photocatalyst led to a shift of the N 1s peak.43 The O 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3d) exhibits two peaks centered at 532.5 and 531.4 eV, which can be attributed to the absorbed H2O on the catalyst and the O2− in molybdenum oxide.40,44 To better illustrate the sulfuration process of CNMO, the Mo 3d XPS spectra of the CNMO and CNMS samples and the S 2p XPS spectra of the CNMS samples are given in Fig. 4. For the CNMO sample, three peaks of the Mo 3d XPS spectrum are observed (Fig. 4a). The two peaks centered at 234.8 and 232.0 eV can be assigned to the electron binding energies of Mo6+ 3d3/2 and Mo6+ 3d5/2, respectively,45,46 while the peak at 229.7 eV corresponds to the Mo4+ 3d5/2 of MoO2,46 which indicates that both Mo6+ and Mo4+ states exist on the surface of the CNMO sample. The Mo4+ might have originated from the partial reduction of Mo6+ during the calcination process by ammonia produced from dicyandiamide. Compared with CNMO, two new peaks emerged in the CNMS samples, with one located at ∼228 eV and the other one centered at ∼225 eV, corresponding to the Mo4+ 3d5/2 and S2− 2s bands of MoS2, respectively, which demonstrates the existence of MoS2. The 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks of Mo species usually have separation energies close to 3.1 eV; therefore the Mo4+ 3d3/2 splitting of MoS2 should appear at ∼232 eV.47 However, due to the covering effect of the Mo6+ 3d5/2 peak in MoO3, the Mo4+ 3d3/2 splitting of MoS2 could not be clearly observed and accurately fit. Besides this, as shown in Fig. 4b, the two main peaks of S 2p in the CNMS samples at ∼161 eV and ∼163 eV are ascribed to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 respectively, in accordance with S2− in MoS2. Notably, the peak of Mo4+ 3d5/2 located at ∼228 eV is observed with a shift of 0.7 eV to a lower binding energy from 228.9 to 228.2 eV (Fig. 4a), demonstrating the transformation of MoS2 from the 2H-phase to the 1T-phase.28 Meanwhile, the other peak positions of Mo 3d and S 2p also exhibit downshifts, which can be ascribed to the formation of metallic 1T-phase MoS2 in the CNMS composites.48 It can be noticed that the area ratios of the peaks of Mo4+ 3d5/2 and S 2s increase gradually with the increasing amount of thiourea and hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the CNMS samples (Table S1†), indicating the increasing sulfuration extent of the CNMS samples. All of the above results prove the successful generation of 1T-phase MoS2 sandwiched between MoO3 and g-C3N4.

3.3 Porous characteristics and optical properties
To determine the surface area of the as-synthesized samples, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured for the samples. Fig. S4† displays the isotherm curves and the corresponding pore-size distribution of the g-C3N4, CNMO and CNMS-2 samples (the data of the specific surface area of the samples are shown in Table S2†). The CNMO sample exhibits a significantly increased specific surface area (SBET) (32.35 m2 g−1), which is nearly 5 times higher than that of g-C3N4 (5.89 m2 g−1). In the meantime, CNMO also shows a higher total pore volume (Vpore) (0.39 cm3 g−1) than that of g-C3N4 (0.15 cm3 g−1). This enhancement can be attributed to the fact that the ammonia produced by the decomposition of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate during the calcination process could lead to the formation of a mesoporous structure of g-C3N4, which largely increased the SBET and Vpore of the CNMO composites. Furthermore, the CNMS-2 sample displays the highest SBET and Vpore compared with g-C3N4 and CNMO, which may be due to the crumpled structure resulting from the hydrothermal process and the generation of MoS2 nanosheets.
To investigate the optical performances of the as-obtained products, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurement was conducted on g-C3N4, CNMO and CNMS samples (Fig. 5a). The Tauc plot for optical-band-gap determination is illustrated in Fig. 5b. As shown in Fig. 5a, an absorption edge at ∼460 nm can be discovered in the profile of pure g-C3N4. Compared with g-C3N4, the CNMO sample presents a slight red shift in the absorption edge and a broader absorption in the UV–vis absorption spectrum, which can be ascribed to the optical absorption of MoO3. After the in situ generation of MoS2, the as-obtained CNMS samples exhibit enhanced absorption in the visible-light region, and the composites display stronger optical absorption with increasing MoS2 content, indicating that the introduction of MoS2 could effectively improve the visible light absorption of the photocatalyst so as to promote the photocatalytic activity of the composites. As indicated by Fig. 5b, the estimated values of direct Eg for g-C3N4, CNMO, CNMS-1, CNMS-2, CNMS-3, CNMS-4 and CNMS-5 are 2.74, 2.56, 2.49, 2.45, 2.42, 2.40 and 2.36 eV, respectively, suggesting that the Eg of g-C3N4 can be adjusted by coupling with MoO3, and further reduced by introducing MoS2 into the composites, which is consistent with the UV–vis absorption spectra of these samples (Fig. 5a).

3.4 Photocatalytic performance for H2 evolution
To investigate the photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared photocatalysts, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rates over g-C3N4, CNMO and CNMS samples were tested using TEOA as the sacrificial reagent under visible light (>420 nm) irradiation. As displayed in Fig. 6a, the pure g-C3N4 shows a poor photocatalytic H2 evolution activity (39.5 μmol h−1 g−1), which can be ascribed to its limited light-harvesting efficiency and fast recombination of photoinduced charge carriers. As expected, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of the CNMO sample is greatly improved (145.7 μmol h−1 g−1), nearly 3.7 times that of the pure g-C3N4. This observation indicates an accelerated dynamic process of photoinduced charge separation and transfer occurring at the interface between MoO3 and g-C3N4, which is crucial to the photocatalytic H2 production activity of the heterostructure. Besides this, the porous nanosheet structure of g-C3N4 in the CNMO composites is also a contributing factor for the enhanced photocatalytic activity, which enhances the separation of photogenerated charge carriers. Notably, after the in situ generation of 1T-phase MoS2, a significantly improved photocatalytic performance was observed, with the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 513.0 μmol h−1 g−1 occurring for the CNMS-2 sample, which is nearly 12 times higher than that of the pure g-C3N4. It is therefore believed that the 1T-phase MoS2 can greatly facilitate the charge transfer between MoO3 and g-C3N4 and thus inhibit the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, resulting in the high photocatalytic activity of CNMS composites. Moreover, it is worth pointing out that the CNMS-1 sample, which is mainly composed of the 2H-phase MoS2, displays a lower photocatalytic performance compared with the other CNMS samples that contain a larger proportion of 1T-phase MoS2, suggesting the superior ability of 1T-phase MoS2 in improving charge transfer in comparison with 2H-phase MoS2. Furthermore, with the increasing content of 1T-phase MoS2, a decrease in the photocatalytic activity of CNMS samples was discovered, indicating that the photocatalytic performance is dependent on the amount of 1T-phase MoS2. As displayed in Fig. S5,† the thickness of the MoS2 layers in the CNMS samples increases with the deeper extent of sulfuration. The excessive 1T-phase MoS2 could form a thick layer sandwiched between MoO3 and g-C3N4, which may increase the resistance for charge carriers to transfer, thus leading to a reduction in photocatalytic H2 production. To exclude the contribution of the surface area, the H2 production rates of the samples were normalized to the corresponding BET surface areas, which are shown in Fig. S6.† It is found that the H2 evolution rates over the g-C3N4, CNMO and CNMS-1 samples displayed no great difference, while the CNMS-2 sample exhibited the highest H2 evolution rate among the samples, further elucidating the beneficial effect of the Z-scheme charge transfer facilitated by the 1T-phase MoS2. Besides this, the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH) was evaluated by using a 300 W Xenon arc lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter as the light source (25.8 mW cm−2) and the CNMS-2 sample as the catalyst (10 mg catalyst in 20 mL deionized water). During the 4 hours’ illumination, 20.52 μmol H2 was detected by gas chromatography (GC), and therefore the STH of CNMS-2 was determined to be 0.047% according to the reported method (detailed calculation process is provided in the ESI†).49

The stability and durability of a photocatalyst is crucial for practical photocatalytic H2 production applications. We then further conducted a cycling test of the CNMS-2 sample for 16 h under the same conditions. As observed in Fig. 6b, no obvious H2 evolution rate decrease was observed within the four cycles in 16 h, suggesting that the CNMS-2 sample is highly stable and resistant to photocorrosion. Besides that, we also performed the H2 evolution test over the CNMS-2 sample that has been stored for 30 days, and found that the H2 generation rate remains nearly unchanged, which can be strong evidence of the high stability of the 1T-phase MoS2 after a long duration, which can be attributed to the protection from this sandwich structure where 1T-phase MoS2 is tightly sandwiched between MoO3 and g-C3N4.
3.5 Charge carrier separation and transfer
To understand the key roles of MoO3 and 1T-phase MoS2 in the CNMO and CNMS composites, PL measurement was carried out to investigate the photoinduced interfacial charge separation behaviors. As shown in Fig. 7, the pure g-C3N4 sample exhibits a strong emission peak centered at about 460 nm under an excitation wavelength of 350 nm, which can be attributed to the band–band PL phenomenon with the energy of light approximately equaled to the band gap energy of g-C3N4.50 The CNMO sample was found to possess a weaker PL emission peak compared with the pure g-C3N4, suggesting a lower recombination rate of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs. This indicates that the formation of the heterostructure could effectively enhance the charge transfer between MoO3 and g-C3N4, thus leading to an improvement in the separation efficiency of the photo-generated charge carriers. When MoS2 was introduced into the interface of MoO3 and g-C3N4, a low PL intensity was observed in the CNMS-1 sample, demonstrating the inhibited recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. For the CNMS-2 sample which contains a larger ratio of 1T-phase MoS2, a much lower PL intensity was obtained, suggesting that the 1T-phase MoS2 with extraordinary conductivity could provide shorter pathways for photoexcited charge carriers to transfer between MoO3 and g-C3N4, and thus dramatically reduce the chance of their recombination. However, with a further increased content of 1T-phase MoS2, a stronger PL intensity was found in the CNMS samples. This result indicates that a thicker layer of 1T-phase MoS2 is disadvantageous for the transfer of photoinduced charge carriers.
 Fig. 7  PL spectra of the g-C3N4, CNMO and CNMS samples. 
To gain deep insights into the charge transfer behaviors in the composites, the transient photocurrent and EIS measurements were carried out on the g-C3N4, CNMO and CNMS samples. Fig. 8a depicts the transient visible-light photocurrent responses recorded for several cycles under the intermittent visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). All the samples exhibit reversible photocurrent responses on each illumination. The CNMO sample shows a higher photocurrent than the pure g-C3N4, which can be ascribed to the enhanced absorption of visible light as well as improved charge separation and migration efficiency resulting from the heterojunction between MoO3 and g-C3N4. The CNMS-2 sample displays the highest transient photocurrent density among all the samples, strongly confirming that the 1T-phase MoS2 endows the composites with superior spatial charge transfer ability, which allows more electrons to participate in the photocatalytic reactions and thus results in an improved photocatalytic performance. With a further increase in the proportion of 1T-phase MoS2, a decrease in the photocurrent was observed for the CNMS-3, CNMS-4 and CNMS-5 samples, indicating that a thicker layer of 1T-phase MoS2 could inhibit the photogenerated charge transfer progress. The EIS measurement is also an effective approach to study the charge transfer process.51 As shown in Fig. 8b, the CNMS-2 sample displays a much smaller EIS arc radius than the pure g-C3N4 and the CNMO samples, indicating that the CNMS-2 sample has the smallest charge transfer resistance, ultimately resulting in a high separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. The CNMS-1 sample displays a larger EIS arc radius than that of the CNMS-2 sample, demonstrating that 1T-phase MoS2 could more effectively facilitate the charge carrier transfer in comparison with 2H-phase MoS2. As for the CNMS-3, CNMS-4 and CNMS-5 samples, their EIS arc radii were also larger than that of the CNMS-2 sample, suggesting a larger charge transfer resistance caused by the thick layer of MoS2.

3.6 Transfer mechanism of charge carriers
Based on the above-mentioned results, it can be reasonably concluded that the outstanding photocatalytic activity of the CNMS samples is mainly derived from the existence of the 1T-phase MoS2 by suppressing the charge recombination and enhancing the charge transfer in the composites. However, what is the role of the 1T-phase MoS2 in the electron transfer mechanism of the CNMS composites? What is the superiority of 1T-phase MoS2 in comparison with the 2H-phase MoS2 in the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance? To find these answers, we carried out the test of hydroxyl radical (˙OH) detection over the as-obtained samples to further investigate the transfer mechanism of charge carriers. The PL measurement using terephthalic acid as a probe molecule was performed to detect the generated ˙OH. In principle, the PL emission peak intensity is proportional to the amounts of ˙OH in solution.52 Generally speaking, there are two pathways for the generation of ˙OH radicals in the photocatalytic process. One is from the photoexcited electrons that react with dissolved oxygen to produce superoxide radical anions (˙O2−), and then the ˙O2− anions react with hydrogen ions (H+) to produce ˙OH radicals. The other pathway originates from the photoexcited holes that react with water molecules (H2O) or hydroxyl ions (OH−) to produce ˙OH radicals. To identify through which pathway the ˙OH radicals were generated, EDTA-Na2 was employed as the h+ scavenger while p-benzoquinone was used as the ˙O2− scavenger in our experiments. As shown in Fig. S7a,† no obvious PL emission peak was observed for MoO3 when EDTA-Na2 was added as the h+ scavenger, while an obvious PL emission peak appeared when p-benzoquinone was added as the ˙O2− scavenger (Fig. S7b†), indicating that the ˙OH radicals can be produced from the photoexcited holes in the VB of MoO3 instead of the photoexcited electrons in the CB of MoO3, consistent with its VB and CB positions that the VB position of MoO3 is more positive than E(˙OH/H2O) and E(˙OH/OH−) while E(O2/˙O2−) is more negative than the CB position of MoO3 (Fig. S7c†).53 The opposite has happened when MoO3 was replaced by g-C3N4. When g-C3N4 was applied, the PL emission peak appeared in the presence of EDTA-Na2 rather than p-benzoquinone, suggesting that ˙OH radicals have originated from the photoexcited electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 instead of the photoexcited holes in the VB of g-C3N4, which also matches with the relative positions between the VB of g-C3N4 and E(˙OH/H2O) and E(˙OH/OH−), as well as between the CB of g-C3N4 and E(O2/˙O2−). As for CNMO, a strong and a weak PL emission peak appeared in the presence of p-benzoquinone and EDTA-Na2, respectively, suggesting that the ˙OH radicals are mainly produced from the photoexcited holes, and the photoexcited electrons also have some contribution. As the VB position of g-C3N4 is more negative than E(˙OH/H2O) and E(˙OH/OH−), the holes in the VB of g-C3N4 cannot oxidise H2O and OH− to produce ˙OH radicals, but the holes in the VB of MoO3 can. Therefore, the hole-generated ˙OH radicals must be the photoexcited holes in the VB of MoO3. Similarly, the CB position of MoO3 is more positive than E(O2/˙O2−), so the electrons in the CB of MoO3 cannot reduce O2 to produce ˙O2− and then to ˙OH radicals, but the electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 can. Therefore, the electron-generated ˙OH radicals must be the photoexcited electrons in the CB of g-C3N4. Thus, it can certainly be concluded that the photoexcited holes tend to remain in the VB of MoO3 and the photoexcited electrons tend to remain in the CB of g-C3N4. Meanwhile, the photoexcited electrons in the CB of MoO3 transfer to the VB of g-C3N4, constructing a direct Z-scheme photocatalytic system without an electron mediator. Compared with CNMO, CNMS-2 presented the strongest PL peak intensity among all the samples that appeared in the presence of EDTA-Na2 and p-benzoquinone, respectively, indicating that the separation and transfer of charge carriers in CNMS-2 composites are further promoted due to the Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism where the 1T-phase MoS2 acts as the electron mediator between g-C3N4 and MoO3 (Fig. 9), resulting in an increased ˙OH generation. The charge transfer pathway in the CNMS-1 sample is discussed in the ESI,† and the pathways of ˙OH produced from MoO3/2H-MoS2/g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. S8.†

3.4 Photocatalytic mechanism of CNMS composites
On the basis of the above-mentioned results and discussion, a possible photocatalytic mechanism for the CNMS composites is proposed in Fig. 10. Upon visible-light irradiation, electrons and holes are both generated in g-C3N4 and MoO3. In the original binary CNMO composites, a direct Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism exists between g-C3N4 and MoO3, in which the photoinduced electrons in the CB of MoO3 migrate to the VB of g-C3N4 and subsequently recombine with the holes in g-C3N4. When the 1T-phase MoS2 is introduced into the composites, owing to the bridging effect of the metallic 1T-phase MoS2 channels, the photoinduced electrons in the MoO3 transfer to g-C3N4 preferably through a MoO3 → MoS2 → g-C3N4 pathway and finally recombine with the photogenerated holes in g-C3N4, and the electrons remaining in g-C3N4 reduce H+ to H2, while the holes left in MoO3 are trapped by the sacrificial agent (TEOA), resulting in efficient spatial separation of the charge carriers. Notably, in comparison with the direct Z-scheme mechanism, the in situ generated 1T-phase MoS2 constructs a new pathway for charge carriers to migrate, which largely reduces the charge transfer resistance and realizes the rapid interfacial charge separation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the outstanding photocatalytic performance of the CNMS samples can be mainly attributed to the 1T-phase MoS2 that possesses extraordinary conductivity, which builds up a unique transfer pathway for photogenerated charge carriers and thus achieves highly-efficient spatial charge separation. Apart from this, the light-harvesting properties of CNMS composites could also yield more photogenerated electron–hole pairs to participate in the photocatalytic reactions under visible-light illumination. Besides this, the porous g-C3N4 nanosheets formed during the calcination procedure could also speed up the charge transfer during the photocatalytic process.54 All these positive factors simultaneously contribute to the superior visible-light photocatalytic performance of the CNMS composites.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a new class of MoO3/1T-MoS2/g-C3N4 nanohybrids were successfully fabricated via a facial two-step procedure. Our detailed studies revealed that the metallic 1T-phase MoS2 could act as an efficient non-metal electron mediator in the Z-scheme system, which builds up a highly-efficient pathway for charge carriers to transfer and thus realizes rapid spatial charge separation. Moreover, the MoO3/1T-MoS2/g-C3N4 exhibits high stability and durability, demonstrating its great potential in photocatalytic applications. Our mechanistic studies also elucidated the role of the 1T-phase MoS2 in the charge transfer by ˙OH detection tests. These new findings could provide important guidelines for the design and fabrication of an efficient and stable Z-scheme system for photocatalytic applications.
