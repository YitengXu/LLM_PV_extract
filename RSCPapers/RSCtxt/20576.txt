    AbstractDepleting fossil fuel resources and continuously degrading environment due to greenhouse gases demands an immediate search for alternative energy resources on an emergency basis to develop a sustainable and green environment. The utilization of coke oven gas, biogas and flue gases from fossil fuel power plants to produce synthesis gas, which is a major feedstock for the production of liquid fuels (methanol), is beneficial both from economical and environmental aspect. In this review paper, our aim is to discuss the applicability of these sources in different reforming processes to produce suitable syn-gas ratio (∼2) for methanol production. The feasibility, suitability and applicability of each source have been discussed in detail accompanied with their environmental impact and detailed economic analysis. Moreover, the influence of different supports, promoters and preparation methods on the catalyst properties to minimize carbon deposition has also been described. This review will summarize all the recent advances in the area of syn-gas production for methanol synthesis.Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman is a Ph.D student in Prof. Wan Mohd Ashri Bin Wan Daud's research group at the University of Malaya.

1. Introduction
Fossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal) are the major source of energy and have been utilized as a feedstock for a number of man-made materials such as: gasoline, diesel oil and various petrochemicals, plastics and pharmaceuticals. During the 19th century, the rapid industrialization and urbanization has led to the increased consumption of fossil fuels. Therefore, it is necessary to search for alternative energy sources on an emergency basis due to the increased costs of fossil fuels and depletion of energy sources. It is estimated that the current population (6 billion) will jump to 9–10 billion by mid-21st, whereas, the current estimated oil reserves (200 billion metric tons) will only last for 40 years with the current consumption rate. Therefore, to meet the energy demand in the coming years it is advisable to look for alternative and efficient energy sources and one way to meet the challenge is to produce efficient manmade hydrocarbons.1 Methanol is considered to be one of important raw material for the production of biodiesel and as an alternative fuel.1–4 Another feature of methanol is that it can be blended with gasoline, even though it processes half of the volumetric energy density of diesel or gasoline.1–4 Methanol belonging to alcohol family is considered as the simplest of all alcohols and the global annual production of methanol in 2007 was 38 million metric tons.5 Besides its utilization for the production of biodiesel, it is widely utilized in the synthesis of formaldehyde, acetic acid and man-made materials such as: polymers and paints. Moreover, it has been regarded as a clean, convenient energy-storage material and a bridge to the renewable energy future.1 Furthermore, the production of methanol has several advantages such as: low toxicity, easy to handle and lower risks associated with its transportation. Methanol can be consumed directly into the existing internal combustion engine and fuel cells. Moreover, the storage of methanol does not require high pressure at room temperature, as in the case of H2 storage.1,2 Methanol has several advantages over currently highly consumable gasoline, as the latent heat vaporization of methanol is 3.7 times higher than gasoline, which allows it to adsorb more heat from the system as it changes from liquid to gaseous state. This special feature of methanol allows it application for air-cooled radiators instead of the currently heavier water-cooled system. Methanol-powered vehicles will provide smaller, lighter engine block, reduced cooling requirements and better mileage. The consumption of methanol as fuel is safer compared to gasoline and diesel as its combustion will produce lower emissions of noxious gases (NOx, SO2 and certain hydrocarbons).6
Natural gas (NG) consists of a major component of methane and low balances of other hydrocarbons comprised on ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), and butane (C4H10). Moreover, it also contains inert diluents such as molecular nitrogen (N2) and carbon dioxide (CO2).7 Large numbers of NG reservoirs are located far from industrial complexes and often produced offshore. The transportation of NG to potential market by pipelines may not be available and liquefaction for shipping by an ocean-going vessel is expensive.8 In 2011, a large volume of NG (140 billion cubic meters, (BCM)) has been flared globally;9 moreover two disadvantages occurred from flaring, first: the wastage of an important hydrocarbon source worth billions and second: the increase in global warming problem by the production of GHG.10 The conversion of natural gas into liquid fuels has been a great challenge and two possible routes have been considered called as direct conversion and indirect conversion. However, the direct conversion of natural gas to methanol by partial oxidizing methane is far from being feasible because the products from this route are more reactive than the starting feedstock (CH4).11 Although this route may have higher selectivity (∼80%) but the major problem lies in its lower conversion per pass (∼7). This route requires large recycle ratio and the lower partial pressure of the products create problems in the separation. Therefore, indirect conversion is considered as an efficient way to produce methanol although it require high capital investments.12 Methanol is produced by the gaseous reaction of synthesis gas (syn-gas) and the required ratio of syn-gas (H2/CO) for methanol synthesis is two, as described in the following eqn (1). CO + 2H2 → CH3OH, ΔH298 K = −91 kJ mol−1(1)
The production of syn-gas from natural gas (NG) is an important technology in the chemical industry, as syn-gas is a building block for valuable liquid fuels and chemicals such as Fischer–Tropsch oil, methanol and dimethyl ether.8,13–15 The processes that draw industrial attention are steam reforming of methane (SRM), partial oxidation of methane (POX) and dry reforming of methane (DRM).16 However, the choice of reforming technology depends on its suitability for the production of suitable syn-gas ratio and scale of operation for methanol production.12
Stoichiometric SRM (H2O:CH4 = 1:1) produces a higher syn-gas ratio (H2/CO = 3)17 compared to that required for methanol synthesis (H2/CO = 2).18–20 The presence of water in the feed leads to the occurrence of water gas shift (WGS) reaction to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide (eqn (3)). WGS reaction is slightly exothermic reaction and stoichiometry of the reaction (equal number of moles of reactants and products) drive us to conclusion that this reaction is independent of pressure and will be favored at low temperatures. Therefore, the overall SRM reaction followed by WGS reaction is regarded as global SRM reaction (eqn (4)) having high syn-gas ratio (H2/CO = 4).21 However, the application of SRM produced syn-gas with such higher ratios is not suitable for liquid fuels (e.g., methanol). SRM: CH4 + H2O → CO + 3H2, ΔH298 K = 225.4 kJ mol−1(2) WGS: CO + H2O → CO2 + H2, ΔH298 K = −41 kJ mol−1(3) Global SRM: CH4 + 2H2O → CO2 + 4H2, ΔH298 K = 165 kJ mol−1(4)
Therefore, it was suggested that the desired syn-gas ratio (∼2) can be achieved only at very low steam/methane (S/C) ratios. The operation of process at such reaction conditions will produce smaller amounts of CO2 and also requires lower amount of gas to be recycled. As high recycling demands high energy consumption and higher content of carbon dioxide in purge gas means less carbon yield and large syn-gas unit. However, this process is only suitable for lower methanol production units around 1000–1500 metric tons per day (MTPD).12 Moreover, SRM is an energy intensive process due to the endothermic nature of reaction and requires high investments of capital.22 SRM process faces corrosion issues and requires a desulphurization unit.23,24 The source of carbon deposition in the SRM is believed to be either methane decomposition reaction (eqn (5)) or CO disproportionation reaction (also referred as Boudouard reaction) as described below in eqn (6). CH4 → C + 2H2, ΔH298 K = 75 kJ mol−1(5) 2CO → CO2 + C, ΔH298 K = −172 kJ mol−1(6)
Whisker carbon formed due to the decomposition of adsorbed methane on the metal surface to produce adsorbed carbon atom and regarded as a major contributor in carbon formation. Even though the desired syn-gas ratio can be obtained by working at lower S/C ratios, the application of lower S/C ratio leads to the sever carbon formation over Ni-based catalysts because in the presence of excess S/C ratios the deposited carbon can be removed through steam gasification.25
Partial oxidation of methane (POX) draws industrial attention due to exothermic nature of reaction, which requires lower energy consumptions (eqn (7)). The advantages of this process are high conversion rates, high selectivity and very short residence time.26 However, exothermic nature of reaction induces hot spots on catalyst surface due to poor heat removal rate and makes operation difficult to control.16,23 CH4 + 1/2O2 → CO + 2H2, ΔH298 K = −22.6 kJ mol−1(7)
The major drawback of this process is the high cost affiliated with the air separation unit that accounts up to 40% of the total cost of the synthesis gas plant. Therefore, to overcome this problem routes based on air were considered eliminating the requirement of cryogenic air separation plant. However, the use of air in POX process is limited to the once-through synthesis scheme to avoid huge accumulation of nitrogen.27 Moreover, the application of syn-gas containing high nitrogen content will have an adverse impact on methanol conversion.28 The application of air in synthesis gas plant leads to big gas volumes and consequently will demand big feed/effluent heat exchangers and compressors. This kind of setup is not feasible for large scale plants. The availability of oxygen at a lower cost can be a vital factor to reduce the cost of synthesis gas manufacture. One such approach is the application of a reactor concept with oxygen additives through a membrane. The reported oxygen ion diffusivities make a syn-gas unit possible but the feasibility of the scheme is yet to be demonstrated. Moreover, the membrane separation setup which utilizes less energy remains expensive mainly due to the challenges associated with its fabrication, installation and integration.29 Another problem with such setup is that it cannot fully separate oxygen from air; however it can only be used to increase oxygen concentration in the feed stream with the possible passage of nitrogen through the membrane.30
Futhermore, the application of DRM process offers valuable environmental benefits such as: the utilization of biogas having considerable amounts of GHG (60–65% methane and 40–35% carbon dioxide)31,32 and also makes possible the conversion of NG with high CO2 content to valuable syn-gas.8,20 Although, DRM has an interested feature of utilizing GHG, it yielded a lower syn-gas ratio (H2/CO = 1), which was not suitable for the production of methanol. CH4 + CO2 → 2H2 + 2CO, ΔH298 K = 247 kJ mol−1(8)
Therefore, in this study combination of different reforming process (DRM or SRM or POX) will be investigated for their influence to minimize carbon deposition with the addition of steam and O2 in the system and the effect of H2O/CH4 and O2/CH4 ratios to control syn-gas ratio. Moreover, various possible feed sources such as: coke oven gases, biogas and flue gases, to produce suitable syn-gas ratio (H2/CO = 1.5–2.0) by the combination of the any of the two reforming process (SRM, POX or DRM) or combination of all three processes regarded as tri-reforming process will be described. Furthermore, different types of catalysts investigated for reforming process will be described in detail.
2. Methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation
Two major routes are considered for the methanol synthesis via syn-gas and CO2 hydrogenation. This review paper is focused on the methanol synthesis via syn-gas; however, it will be necessary to discuss the brief overview of CO2 hydrogenation. There are number of review papers published in the recent years describing the thorough background of the process and detailed information on the recent advances.3,33–43 The inexpensive, non-toxic, non-flammable and abundant nature of CO2 urges researchers for its chemical utilization and efforts have been made towards the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate, cyclic carbonates and syn-gas as well as methanol synthesis.34 CO2 is a kind of potential carbon raw materials and also regarded as a major greenhouse gas.44 Therefore, utilization of greenhouse gas in the synthesis of chemicals made by the hydrogenation of CO2 is the most economical way to deal with the crisis of global warming and greenhouse gas issue.2,45 The major reactions in the methanol synthesis are CO2 hydrogenation (eqn (9)) and a side reaction referred to as reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction (eqn (10)). CO2 hydrogenation: CO2 + 3H2 → CH3OH + H2O, ΔH298 K = −49.50 kJ mol−1(9) RWGS: CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O, ΔH298 K = 41.19 kJ mol−1(10)
Thermodynamic analysis of methanol synthesis reaction indicated the exothermic nature of reaction and reduction of reaction molecular number. Therefore, this reaction was favored at low temperature and high pressure.34 The major challenge faced during the catalytic synthesis of methanol is the higher production of water from both the reactions that had an inhibiting effect on the metal activity during the process.34,46 Therefore, to diminish the negative influence of water production on the methanol synthesis process, it was suggested to enhance hydrophobic characteristics of the catalysts to achieve better catalytic activities. The occurrence of RWGS leads to the consumption of hydrogen and in result lower the methanol formation. There are many studied focusing on the promotion of catalysts, however, it is suggested that the application and synthesis of novel catalysts should be encouraged which can directly convert CO2 and remain inactive in RWGS reaction.47
The most commonly studied catalyst for methanol synthesis via hydrogenation route is the combination of Cu/Zn system;34,48 moreover, the application of various metal (Zr, Ga, Si, Al, B, Cr, Ce, V, Ti, etc)49–52 and metal oxides (ZrO2, Ga2O3 and SiO2) additives are also studied over Cu–Zn system.53 The mechanistic study of CO2 hydrogenation reveals that CO2 adsorbs on Cu and H2 adsorbs on Zn and the reaction takes place on the surface of the catalyst. Based on various studies, it was deduced that the high Cu/Zn dispersion is a key factor for high methanol yield and selectivity for methanol synthesis.48 Słoczyński et al.54 investigated the addition of Mg and Mn oxides on Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 catalyst and reported the significant influence of MnO promoter on methanol yield and catalytic activity. Another study reported the influence of various active metal (M = Cu, Ag, Au) supported on 3ZnO·ZrO2 system and the study reported higher catalytic activity for Cu/catalyst compared to Ag and Au-based catalyst. This can be dedicated to the strong synergy between Cu and ZnO or ZrO2.55 The promotional influence of various metal oxides of B, Ga, In, Gd, Y, Mn, and Mg was studied on Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 catalyst prepared by two methods: first, by the co-precipitation of basic carbonates and second by complexing with citric acid. It was reported that the addition of metal oxides has strong influence in the enhancement of catalytic activity, stability, dispersion of Cu, modifying surface composition of the catalyst and among all the metal oxides Ga2O3 was the more effective and efficient one.56 Sami et al.57 investigated the addition of small amount of silica (0.6 wt%) to Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by co-precipitation. The addition of SiO2 leads to high surface area, pore volume, smaller crystallite size and higher dispersion of Cu. Moreover, the addition of SiO2 leads to the suppression of crystallization of Cu occurred due to the products of water produced during methanol synthesis and inhibited sintering. The application of ZrO2 as a carrier or additive for Cu-based catalysts exhibited higher performance due to its excellent ion exchange capacity and abundant oxygen vacancy surface. Zhang et al.58 investigated the application of ZrO2 modifier on Cu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and reported that addition of Zr enhances the dispersion of CuO species and produced better catalyst performance.
Furthermore, it was proposed that an industrial CO2 hydrogenation process should be operated at low reaction temperatures. However, a conventional Cu/Zn/Al that was active for methanol synthesis from syn-gas59 is not as active and selective for the same purpose from a H2/CO2 mixture at temperature below 250 °C.60 Therefore, there was a need to synthesize novel catalysts with high catalytic activity at lower reaction temperatures and selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation. Two major routes are considered to achieve this goal: first is the adoption of complicated preparation procedures to develop catalysts with desired properties and second is the addition of certain metal and metal oxides other than Al on Cu/Zn crystallites or Cu/Zn/Al composites. A novel fibrous Cu/Zn/Al/Zr was prepared and exhibited higher catalytic activity compared to Cu/Zn/Al, Pt–Ca/C or Cu/Zr based catalysts. The application of Cu/Zn/Al/Zr catalyst exhibited higher CO2 conversion and methanol yield.48,60 Cu-based catalysts are usually prepared by co-precipitation method which requires precise pH control and longer aging time for the suspensions.61 Several other methods such as hydrothermal,62 sol–gel63,64 and reverse emulsion techniques65 have also been developed to prepare Cu-based catalysts. These described methods also require longer period of time, complex procedure and in some cases require expensive starting materials.66 Therefore, Xin et al.67,68 developed a novel catalysts synthesis procedure regarded as solid-state synthesis approach in which solid-state metathesis reaction occur between hydrate transition metal salts and organic ligand to yield metal complexes, metal clusters or oxides with uniform sizes and shapes. Similar results were reported by Guo et al.61 for the preparation of Cu/Zn/ZrO2 catalyst with this approach exhibiting better catalytic activity and selectivity for methanol synthesis. Another study reported the application of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with metal nitrates to form long CNTs intercrossed Cu/Zn/AL/Zr catalyst and reported an enhance effect on methanol yield from 0.94 to 0.28 (g gcat−1 h−1) compared to Cu/Zn/Al/Zr catalyst alone without CNTs. This can be dedicated to the phase separation, ion doping, hydrogen reversibly adsorption; moreover, the high thermal conductivity of CNTs improved the stability of the catalyst owing to the fact that CNTs are a good promoter for the Cu/Zn/Al/Zr catalysts.69
Noble metal catalysts especially Pd-based catalysts are the most effective catalysts exhibiting significant catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation. Collins et al.70 investigated the application of β-Ga2O3 as a support for Pd active metal and compared the results with pure β-Ga2O3. It was reported that Pd-based catalyst exhibited higher conversion rates for feed gas, which was dedicated to the strong metal–support interaction and spillover of atomic hydrogen from active metal Pd to β-Ga2O3. Fan et al.71 studied the application of Pd/CeO2 for CO2 hydrogenation and reported higher catalytic activity and stability. Bonivardi et al.72 investigated the promotional effect of Ga on Pd/SiO2 and reported enhanced catalytic performance, which can be dedicated to the closeness of Ga2O3–Pd functions and hydrogen spillover onto the SiO2 support. Liang et al.73 investigated the application of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as a support for Pd–ZnO catalyst and reported higher catalytic activity and TOF (1.15 × 10−2 s−1) for 16%Pd0.1Zn1/MWCNTs under reaction conditions of 3.0 MPa and 523 K. The catalytic activity exhibited by CNTs supported catalyst was high compared to 35%Pd0.1Zn1/AC and 20%Pd0.1Zn1/γ-Al2O3. However, the high cost of noble metals restricts their application on industrial scale and Cu-based catalysts are commonly used for this purpose. The industrial methanol synthesis process using copper–zinc catalysts is thus the starting point for implementation of methanol chemistry in a future energy scenario.
The capital investment required for a methanol synthesis plant using H2/CO2 mixture was estimated to be about the same as that of a conventional syn-gas based plant. The key factor for the large scale production of methanol is the availability of the raw materials (CO2 and H2).3 It was estimated that around 25 billion tonnes of CO2 yearly added to the atmosphere by the anthropogenic activities.3 In the present scenario, CO2 sequestration is employed to reduce the CO2 associated global warming problems; however, regarded as an expensive process. Therefore, the better option is to utilize captured CO2 from various sources such as industrial and natural sources and this concept is regarded as chemical recycling of carbon dioxide to valuable chemicals (methanol and DME), which provides a renewable, carbon-neutral and inexhaustible source for efficient transport fuels.3 Several technologies have been employed to efficiently capture CO2 absorption into a liquid solution, adsorption, cryogenic separation and permeation through membranes.74 A newly introduced material for the purpose of CO2 capture is the application of metal–organic frameworks (MOF), which are described as a highly porous material with high surface area. Such example of a material is MOF-77 containing zinc clusters joined by 3,5-benzenetribenzene units with a surface area of 4500 m2 g−1 and have a storage capacity of 1.47 g of CO2 per g of MOF at 30 bar.3 Moreover, the requirement of pure CO2 demands more efficient CO2 separation method such as the application of novel CO2 “molecular basket” adsorbent,75 which can selectively capture CO2 for the separation of CO2 from simulated flue gas.76,77 The recent studied showed the successful application of CO2 molecular basket to the separation of CO2 from natural gas fired and coal fired boiler flue gas.78,79
Furthermore, the sustainable and cost-effective production of the other primary raw material (H2) is major challenge.33,80 The current commercial route to produce H2 is steam reforming of methane, coal gasification and partial oxidation of light oil residues.80 Methanol production from H2 and CO2 will be considered an environmentally benign process if it utilizes more CO2 than the one produced during H2 manufacturing. The other routes adopted for H2 production are dry reforming of methane and electrolysis of water; however, these processes have their own limitations due to the high CO content and high electricity cost. Another attractive possible way is the thermo-chemical route as the energy required for water splitting will be supplied by atomic energy or solar energy. The attractiveness of this route is the absence of carbon source (e.g., fossil fuel or biomass origin) for the production of H2.33
A lot of research work is focused on the commercial application of CO2 hydrogenation; however, the certain challenges hindering its application are stable nature of CO2 molecule, economical and feasible availability of raw materials (CO2 and H2) for large scale plants. Moreover, if renewable sources such as solar energy or electricity produced from sunlight are employed to meet the energy requirements for CO2 reduction processes; it comes out to be an attractive option and can enhance the attractiveness of the process. Extensive research priority has been given to the utilization of solar energy for CO2 hydrogenation; with the aim of mitigation of CO2 associated global warming problems, creation of highly sustainable and renewable energy source and the production of valuable liquid fuels.41 Therefore, the scale up of these technologies and further improvements are necessary to capture CO2 efficiently and economically to combat the issue of global warming and to synthesis valuable liquid fuels from problematic greenhouse gas.
3. Methanol synthesis via syn-gas route
In this section, methanol synthesis via syn-gas route and combination of different reforming processes will be investigated with the aim of reducing energy requirements, lower carbon deposition and to enhance attractiveness of reforming processes. Moreover, various sources are considered for their utilization in reforming process such as coke oven gas, biogas, flue gases from power plants based on NG and coal. The composition of biogas depends upon its source such as: sewage digesters usually contain 55% to 65% CH4, 35% to 45% CO2 and 1% N2; from organic waste digesters usually contains 60–70% CH4, 30–40% CO2 and 1% N2. Landfill gases by anaerobic digestion of municipal solid waste have 45–55% CH4, 30–40% CO2 and 5–15% N2.81 Reforming of biogas not only reduces the concentrations of two major GHG (CH4 and CO2) but also enhance recyclability and usability of the GHG to produce useful syn-gas. Furthermore, the addition of various constituents such as oxygen (O2) and steam (H2O) will be studied also based on the requirements of the process.
3.1. Methanol synthesis via coke oven gas
Coke oven gas (COG) is regarded as a by-product from coking plants and the composition of COG is: H2 (55–60%), CH4 (23–27%), CO (5–8%), N2 (3–5%) and a lower quantity of several hydrocarbons. COG has been utilized as a fuel in the coke ovens, however, there is a certain amount of COG, which was still available even after its consumption in coke ovens, and this surplus gas is utilized in other plant processes or sent to torches for flaring.82–86 However, to make use of COG for methanol synthesis, syn-gas ratio should be around 2 and the acceptable range of R parameter (dimensionless) should be around 2.03–2.05 as described by the previous studies,1,87,88 and the value of R is determined by eqn (11).89–93 R, dimensionless = (H2 − CO)/(CO + CO2)(11)
Bermúdez et al.94 studied the production of syn-gas based on CO2 reforming of COG (DR-COG) and conventional process (combination of SRM and POX). The comparison of both models was done on the basis of four parameters such as: energy consumption, CO2 balance, carbon and hydrogen yields and their investigations were based on the simulation software ASPEN PLUS®. They concluded that DR-COG is suitable and feasible alternative to produce suitable syn-gas ratio (H2/CO = 2) compared to conventional process. This conclusion was drawn on the basis of low energy consumption, sustainability of the DR-COG process and higher H2 yields (83.9%) compared to conventional process (H2 yield: 73.2%). Moreover, the methanol produced from DR-COG will not require further processing and can be utilized as fuel straightaway. However, this was not the case for conventional process, which will produce low purity methanol and further purification will be required. DR-COG process (Fig. 1) requires one reactor; however, to achieve suitable syn-gas ratio there is a double loop system: one for the recirculation and the other for the recovery of untreated H2. However, conventional process exhibited a higher potential for energy recovery compared to DR-COG despite of its low purity methanol and complex system requirements. Therefore, an efficient energy integration system will play a decisive role to turn favor for one process over another.
 Fig. 1  Block diagram of DR-COG process.94 
Another study investigated the influence of different parameters such as: temperature (800, 900 and 1000 °C) and volumetric hourly space velocities (VHSV, 0.75–9.30 h−1) on the syn-gas production in the presence of Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.92 In this study, the feed consists of 54% H2 and 23% CO2 and CH4 (denoted as gas ternary mixture, (GTM)), moreover, the effect of H2 addition in the system was compared with the conventional DRM process (CH4 and CO2 = 1:1). The presence of H2 will have two important effects (i) the shift of equilibrium to the left side (reactants), which will lead to the lower reactants (CH4 and CO2) conversion and (ii) the RWGS reaction (eqn (10)) may have more influence on the process leading to the increased consumption of CO2 and H2 and in turn more water produced and a decrease of H2/CO ratio will occur. The comparison of CO2 reforming of methane and CO2 reforming of GTM is presented in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  The comparison of (a) CO2 reforming of methane and (b) CO2 reforming of GTM.92 
It was reported that the increase of reaction temperature (from 800 to 1000 °C) assisted in the reduction of water production exhibiting the absence of RWGS reaction and dominance of DRM at high temperatures. At 1000 °C, there was no water formed and the occurrence of RWGS was avoided, which will lead to higher hydrogen productivity and selectivity. These results are consistent with thermodynamics of reaction since DRM reaction is more endothermic than RWGS, hence, an increase of temperature will lead to the higher impact on dry reforming reaction and in turn higher CH4 conversion, higher H2 production and lower water formation. The lower water content has significant influence on methanol synthesis as the water has deactivating effect on Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst widely used for this reaction.95 Moreover, the study of VHSV effect on the reaction indicates that it has a significant influence over the syn-gas ratio, R parameter and selectivity. In case of syn-gas ratio, VHSV was pointed out to be a critical factor with prominent effect (5% variation with the increase of VHSV from 0.75 to 9.30 h−1) compared to the temperature, which has very little effect (only 0.5% from 800 to 1000 °C). The production of higher syn-gas ratio (>2) indicated that COG is suitable way to produce methanol. However, the influence of carbon monoxide (CO) addition was not considered in this study, which is present in the COG in the range of 5–8% and will be interesting to study its influence.
Therefore, another study by Bermúdez et al.91 investigated the influence of CO addition over the process performance. This study was focused on the CO2 reforming of COG with Ni/Al2O3 catalyst mixed with activated carbon (AC), performed at 800 °C with different feed compositions, such as: GTM consists of 54% H2, 23% CO2 and CH4 and GQM (gas quaternary mixture) consist of 52% H2, 22% CO2 and CH4 and 6% CO. It was proposed that the production of syn-gas can take two routes (i) DRM in which decomposition of methane (eqn (5)) leads to the production of solid carbon and H2 and in the second step the deposited carbon was gasified with CO2 to produce CO referred as reverse Boudouard reaction.CO2 + C ↔ 2CO, ΔH298 K = 172 kJ mol−1
However, the presence of water in the outlet indicates another possible route, which is the occurrence of RWGS reaction (10) followed by the SRM (eqn (2)). The syn-gas ratio for all the catalysts was above 2 and hence, suitable for the production of methanol. However, R parameter value is also essential to justify its application for methanol production. This study showed that certain catalysts (50AC/50Ni, 33AC/67Ni and 100 Ni) are suitable for further applications even though the value of R still was just below 2. However, this problem can be overcome by the addition of H2 in the system, which was unreacted after the methanol synthesis. The addition of CO in the system produced similar effect as explained in the above study for H2 addition, which is the shift of equilibrium to the left side (reactants) and in turn will exhibit lower reactants conversion.89,96 The addition of CO produced lower amounts of water by shifting the RWGS equilibrium to the left and enhanced selectivity of the process. However, the lower water production would have a negative impact on the system as there will be less water available to react with methane (SRM). However, in this study different catalyst for CO2 reforming of COG responded differently with the addition of CO, pure AC catalyst exhibited a slight increase in reactants conversion and opposite was observed for Ni/Al2O3. However, for the mixture of AC and Ni, it was concluded that if AC content in higher than that of Ni/Al2O3 there is a small increase in conversion of reactants and opposite occurs in the case of high Ni/Al2O3 content.
The discussion above focused on the production of syn-gas with COG; however, there are few studies which focus only on the methane part in COG. Shen et al.84 studied the POX based on the COG source to produce syn-gas. Their experimental setup was composed of three systems such as; COG purification, membrane separation and CH4 conversion. In COG purification and membrane separation system, the aim was to separate CH4 from its components and then executed POX (CH4/O2 = 1) to produce syn-gas. However, the disadvantage of this process was the lower syn-gas ratio (H2/CO = 0.4), which was not suitable for the production of methanol. Moreover, it requires complex system to separate and recover methane from COG, which makes this process less attractive and expensive. In the above section, the feasibility of COG to produce suitable syn-gas ratio was investigated with H2 and CO addition and a detailed study leads to the conclusion that COG can be utilized to produce syn-gas for the production of methanol owing to its suitability to the current system without further purification and extra cost. However, it will be interesting to study the influence of different catalysts on the reforming of COG, as most of the studies were focused only on different feed ratios (effect of H2 and CO addition). Further study on economic analysis of the COG reforming process will highlight the attractiveness and feasibility of this process to adapt on industrial scale.
3.2. Methanol synthesis via bi-reforming
There is an always increasing demand and extensive research going on to produce alternative energy sources with less or minimal environmental impact. There is a process termed as “Carnol Process” which is regarded as a combination of two industrial based chemical reactions. The first chemical reaction is methane decomposition reaction producing deposited carbon and gaseous H2. This chemical reaction is thermodynamically favorable at high reaction temperatures. Furthermore, the produced H2 is reacted with captured CO2 from fossil fuel burning power plants and other industrial flue gases.97,98 This process was developed by Brookhaven National Laboratory. The major advantage of this process is the utilization of recovered waste CO2 from the coal burring plant, which results in the decrease of around 90% net CO2 emission compared to the conventional SRM for methanol production. The two basic chemical reactions taking part in Carnol process are described below:Methane decomposition: 3CH4 → 3C + 6H2Methanol synthesis: 2CO2 + 6H2 → 2CH3OH + 2H2OOverall Carnol process: 3CH4 + 2CO2 → 2CH3OH + 2H2O + 3C
Moreover, the attractiveness of the Carnol process is the carbon neutrality that all the carbon content in methane will end up as solid carbon, which can be easily handled, stored and also enhances the economics of the process. The industrial application of this process requires higher temperature 800 °C and not only regarded as a process to produced hydrogen only but the produced carbon black can be used as a commodity material in the tire industry and as a pigments for inks and paints. Even though the process accomplishes a major decrease of net CO2 emission compared to SRM process, the disadvantage of this process is lower number of moles of H2 (2 mol) produced per 1 mol of methane decomposed; however, SRM produces 3 mol of H2 per 1 mol of CH4 utilized. Moreover, this process results in high operational costs for lower amount of H2 generated compared to SRM. Therefore, a combination of methane decomposition and DRM is performed to overcome this issue; however, the environmental benefits of this process are not as high as with “Carnol Process”.3CH4 + CO2 ↔ 2CO + 2H2CH4 ↔ C + 2H22CH4 + CO2 ↔ 2CO + 4H2 + C
The production of suitable syn-gas ratio leads to the methanol synthesis as described in the following reaction2CO + 4H2 ↔ 2CH3OH
However, the basic reaction (DRM) considered in this combination produces lower syn-gas ratio (H2/CO = 1), which is only suitable for the production of Fisher–Tropsch synthesis of alkanes, and not suitable for methanol synthesis. Therefore, another combination of DRM and SRM was considered to produce syn-gas with suitable ratio (H2/CO = 2) to produce methanol and this particular syn-gas was termed as met-gas. This combination of DRM and SRM is termed as bi-reforming in which a specific ratio of methane, steam and carbon dioxide (3:2:1) is adjusted to produce met-gas.3,192CH4 + 2H2O ↔ 2CO + 6H2OCH4 + CO2 ↔ 2CO + 2H23CH4 + 2H2O + CO2 ↔ 4CO + 8H2 ↔ 4CH3OH
A recent study on bi-reforming was reported by Olah et al.19 in which NiO/MgO catalyst was investigated for this process at high pressure (5–30 atm) and temperature (800–950 °C). The significance of this study was the application of high pressure employed near to practical conditions, as previous studies for DRM99,100 and SRM101–103 were done at atmospheric pressure. In this study, NiO/MgO catalyst showed higher catalytic activity (70–75% based on single pass conversion) and stability up to 160 h and high H2/CO ratio (1.9). However, the syn-gas ratio can be increased to suitable syn-gas ratio by adjusting H2O to CO2 ratio in the feed gas. Moreover, this study investigated the influence of catalysts and reactants in a single pass conversion, the overall conversions can be increased by considering the recycle of unreacted gas from outlet.19 However, there were no more studies reported on bi-reforming process, which investigated on different aspects of process such as: different types of catalysts and the impact of recycling (untreated streams) to enhance syn-gas ratio.
3.3. Combination of DRM and POX
The combination of dry reforming and partial oxidation has several advantages such as: effective heat supply due to combination of endothermic and exothermic reactions and also the reduction of hot spots produced in POX alone.104,105 Biogas reforming is considered as an endothermic process, therefore, to enhance acceptability and overall efficiency of the reforming process heat recovery techniques are introduced i.e., utilization of the exhaust gas heat from the engine to produce syn-gas. Lau et al.106 investigated the possibility of utilizing biogas mixed with exhaust gas (i.e. source of O2, H2O, CO2) to study the combination of DRM and POX (eqn (12)) and also studied the influence of O2/CH4 molar ratio (0.16, 0.25 and 0.57), temperature (300–900 °C) and GHSV (16500 and 27500 h−1) on the process performance. Simultaneous DRM and POX reaction is depicted in the eqn (12): 0.6CH4 + 0.4CO2 + 0.15O2 → 0.9CO + 1.2H2 + 0.1CO2(12)
The study indicated that addition of O2 has higher influence on H2 production at low temperature (500 °C) at any O2/CH4 ratio and GHSV. However, with the increase of temperature at low O2/CH4 ratio (0.16), there was seen a negative trend for H2 production and this can be dedicated to the higher O2 utilization by the complete combustion (eqn (13)) of methane forming H2O and CO2. Complete combustion: CH4 + 2O2→ CO2 + 2H2O(13)
Moreover, the investigation on the influence of the temperature indicates that at high temperatures the addition of O2 had little effect on H2 production because of the dominance of dry reforming of biogas due to its endothermic nature of reaction. Therefore, it can be concluded that the increase in temperature leads to the decrease in exothermicity of the combined POX and DRM of biogas.107 It was reported that the effect of GHSV was more prominent at low temperature ranges, where POX is dominant. In Fig. 3a, the influence of GHSV is described with the inlet temperature of 500 °C at the catalyst bed. The increase of peak temperature is linked with the increase of GHSV which enhanced the transfer rate of reactants on the activity sites of the catalyst surface resulting in higher rates of oxidation. The larger amounts of heat release by the exothermic reaction (POX) at high GHSV forms hot layer at the top catalyst bed which assisted in the occurrence of dry reforming process (Fig. 3a).108 Temperature profile of the combined DRM and POX describes the change in peak temperature over the catalyst surface at inlet temperature of 400 °C (Fig. 3b). There can be seen a steep increase in temperature peak from 400 °C to 700 °C with the increase of O2/CH4 ratio (0.16 to 0.57) and can be related with the higher amount of O2 present in the POX reaction. This high peak can be dedicated to the exothermic POX or to complete combustion of methane in biogas and the decline of the temperature is related with the dominance of DRM.
 Fig. 3  (a) Influence of GHSV on reactor temperature profile at inlet temperature 500 °C and (b) reactor temperature profile at GHSV 27500 h−1 at inlet temperature of 400 °C.106 
Özkara-Aydinoğlu et al.109 investigated the addition of Pt (0.2% and 0.3%) to Ni/Al2O3 catalyst and O2 to dry reforming reaction mixture (CH4:CO2 = 2:1 and 1:1). Among all the catalysts prepared (0.3Pt–10Ni, 0.3Pt–15Ni, 0.2Pt–10Ni and 0.2Pt–15Ni), 0.3Pt–10Ni/Al2O3 with lowest Ni/Pt ratio (110) exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability for combined DRM and POX reaction compared to DRM alone (Table 1). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis for the bimetallic catalysts (0.3Pt–10Ni and 0.2Pt–15Ni) indicated that 0.3Pt–10Ni catalyst with lower Ni/Pt ratio (110) exhibited smaller Ni particle size (12.6 nm) compared to 0.2Pt–15Ni catalyst with higher Ni/Pt ratio (250), which exhibited higher particle size (19.8 nm). Moreover, lower Ni/Pt ratio assisted in the easy reduction of NiO particles and smaller Ni particles size produced having higher dispersion over the catalyst surface, which is dedicated to the intimate contact between Pt and Ni active sites.

Another study investigated the application of noble metal catalysts (Pt/ZrO2 (PtZr), Pt/Al2O3 (PtAl)) for the combination of DRM and POX, moreover, the influence of 10% ZrO2 addition on Pt/Al2O3 (PtZrAl) was also reported.110 The highest catalytic activity, stability and lower deactivation rate (0.9% per h) was observed for PtZrAl compared to PtAl (0.9% per h) and PtZr (1.1% per h). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) depicted the higher coke deposition resistance as little weight loss (2%) was observed for PtZrAl catalyst. Furthermore, PtAl and PtZr catalysts exhibited around 10% of weight loss and coke deposition was around 6.7 mg coke gcat−1 h−1. The influence of O2 addition was prominent at low temperatures, moreover, the increase of O2 concentrations in the feed lead to the decrease in H2 selectivity and this observation matched with other studies.111,112
Carbon deposition is a major problem during DRM reaction, which leads to severe catalyst deactivation and lower catalyst performance. Noble metal (Rh, Ru, Pt, Pd, Ir) catalysts have drawn attention for their superior coking resistance, higher stability and activity especially for higher temperature applications (>750 °C).113 Therefore, their application in the DRM has exhibited higher catalytic activity and superior coke deposition resistance, even though their cost is a major issue in their industrial application.114,115 Nematollahi et al.116 investigated the application of noble metal (Rh, Ru, Pt, Pd, Ir) catalysts supported on alumina-stabilized-magnesia (Mg/Al) for combined DRM and POX. The catalytic activity of noble metals for combined reforming reaction exhibits the following trend; Rh ∼ Ru > Ir > Pt > Pd. It was observed that at low and medium temperatures, exothermic reactions (combustion and POX) were dominant; however, with the increase of temperature endothermic reaction (DRM) was dominant and exhibited higher methane conversion. Moreover, the influence of O2 addition was significant at low temperatures (<550 °C) in which negative CO2 conversion were observed. This can be justified on the basis of higher dominance of methane combustion reaction at low temperatures. The activity trend exhibited in this study (Rh and Ru most active) matched with the other studies for DRM in which Rh and Ru exhibited higher catalytic activity compared to Pt, Pd and Ir catalysts.114,115 This was attributed to their smaller particle size, higher dispersion and ability to eliminate carbon deposition completely.
Several studies investigated the combination of DRM and POX in a fixed bed reactor (FBR),117–119 however, there are few studies reporting the influence of fluidized bed reactor (FIBR).120,121 The application of FIBR has the ability to exhibit effective heat transfer, stability of operation and also fluidization of particles lead to lower carbon deposition. A number of studies105,122 reported higher methane conversion and high H2/CO ratio for FIBR compared to FBR as depicted in Table 1. FIBR produces an opportunity for the combination of combustion and reforming process, moreover, there are two types of zones formed during the fluidization of catalysts; one is regarded as oxygen free zone and the other as oxygen rich zone (Fig. 4). In the reforming zone (oxygen free), carbon deposits on the catalyst surface and later on moves to the oxygen rich zone in which deposited carbon is gasified and regenerates the active sites of the catalyst.123,124
 Fig. 4  Conceptual model of FIBR in methane reforming with CO2 and O2.105 
The ability of supports to provide oxygen to metals, such as ZrO2 was suggested to be more beneficial compared to irreducible oxide (Al2O3 or SiO2).125,126 In recent years, solid solutions based on ZrO2 (e.g. MgO–ZrO2, TiO2–ZrO2, Nb2O5–ZrO2) have shown promising results for DRM.127,128 Asencios et al.16 reported the application of NiO–MgO–ZrO2 (NMZ) catalyst with different Ni content (0, 10, 20 and 40 wt%) for combined DRM and POX reaction. The higher catalytic activity (62.0% CH4 and 75.0% CO2 conversion) and stability (7 h) was observed for 20Ni20MZ (20 wt% Ni and 20 mol% MgO). XRD profile indicates that catalysts with higher Ni content (20Ni20MZ and 40Ni20MZ) exhibited the formation of zirconium nickel oxide (Zr3NiO), indicating the presence of strong interaction between NiO and ZrO2. Various studies also confirmed the formation of NiO–ZrO2 solid solution at higher Ni contents (20 and 40 wt%).129–131 The lower catalytic activities for the catalysts with lower Ni content (10 wt%) can be ascribed to the presence of fewer active sites available for methane decomposition, while the lower catalytic activity at higher Ni content (40 wt%) can be related to the presence of larger crystalline size of Nio (60 nm), which gave rise to the sintering of Nio particles due to high nickel load. The carbon deposition formation rates (mmol h−1) were such as: 10Ni20MZ (18) < 20Ni20MZ (20) < 40Ni20MZ (120). Sun et al.132 studied the application of Y2O3 (5%, 8%, 10%) as a promoter for Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and reported that the increase of Y2O3 content (5 to 10%) in Ni/γ-Al2O3 leads to the production of smaller Ni particle size, higher Ni dispersion, strong basicity and higher NiO reducibility compared to unpromoted Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Therefore, Ni/10YAl exhibited higher catalytic activity, which can be dedicated to the higher Ni dispersion (15.7%), NiO reducibility (89.8%), CO2 desorbed (22.3 µmol gcat−1) and smaller Ni size (6.50 nm) compared to Ni/γ-Al2O3 exhibiting poor characteristics (10.3% Ni dispersion, 77.9% NiO reducibility, 5.70 CO2 desorbed and larger particles size (12.1 nm)). Moreover, the addition of Y2O3 enhanced resistance to the metal sintering as depicted by particle size analysis before and after reforming process, as there was little change in particle size for Ni/10YAl (6.50 to 5.20 nm) compared to Ni/Al (12.1 to 14.3 nm). Ruckenstein et al.104 investigated the combined reforming of methane (DRM and POX) over Co/SiO2, Co/CaO and Co/MgO. The author reported higher catalytic activity, stability, lower carbon deposition and high syn-gas ratio for Co/MgO compared to other catalysts (Co/SiO2, Co/CaO). The superior catalytic activity was ascribed to the higher reducibility of the Co/MgO arising due to the strong interaction between metal (Co) and support (MgO). Moreover, smaller metallic crystallites site were formed on MgO-supported catalyst and were partially embedded in the MgO lattice. XRD profiles indicated the formation of different solid solutions arising due to the metal–support interactions and exhibited the presence of smaller crystalline size for Co/MgO compared to Co/CaO and Co/SiO2. The formation of such smaller crystalline sites suppressed the occurrence of carbon deposition as encountered in the methane decomposition. Moreover, TPR profiles indicated the reduction trend in the following manner: (Co, MgO)O ≪ Ca3Co4O9 < Co3O4. The lower reducibility (5%) of the Co/MgO catalysts can be dedicated to the strong metal–support interaction between CoO and MgO.
3.4. Combination of DRM and SRM
The combination of DRM and SRM has more attractiveness in its application compared to DRM alone, as the addition of steam reduces the risk of carbon deposition and gives better control over the syn-gas ratio;107,133,134 as SRM alone produces high syn-gas ratio (H2/CO = 3);101 which is comparatively higher for methanol synthesis.19,20 Mostly, Ni-catalysts are applied for combined reforming due to their low cost and quite significant activity; however, the major problem with their application is their lower resistance to carbon deposition. There are various ways to diminish/eliminate carbon deposition completely or reduce to a minimal which include application of basic supports (MgO, CaO),135–137 addition of various promoter138–142 or optimization of synthesis methods143 and in some studies addition of little amount of noble metals were also done to enhance catalytic activity of Ni-catalysts.144–147 Therefore, to reduce carbon deposition and enhance catalytic activity Ni catalysts, Son et al.148 investigated the combination of DRM and SRM on steam treated Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (WNiAl) and with conventional H2 treated Ni/γ-Al2O3 (NiAl). The WNiAl catalyst exhibited higher reactants conversion (97.1% CH4 and 81.2% CO2) compared to NiAl (90.8% CH4 and 73.3% CO2) and this can be related to the influence of steam treatment on structure and morphology of WNiAl catalyst. TGA analysis exhibited lower weight loss (3.6%) and carbon deposition (0.18 mg C gcat−1 h−1) compared to NiAl (15.4% weight lost and 0.77 mg C gcat−1 h−1 carbon deposition) after 200 h of the reforming reaction (Fig. 5b). Moreover, TPR-H2 profile indicated the shift of reduction peak to higher temperature (700–1000 °C) for WNiAl and exhibits the presence of strong metal–support interaction; however, lower reduction peak (100–400 °C) was exhibited for NiAl (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, a higher decrease in pore volume (0.34 cm3 g−1 to 0.15 cm3 g−1) was noticed for NiAl compared to WNiAl (0.45 cm3 g−1 to 0.39 cm3 g−1) and this can be ascribed to the higher carbon deposition blocking the pore volume. This conclusion matched with the TGA results, which exhibited higher coke deposition for NiAl compared to WNiAl.

Huang et al.149 investigated the promotional influence of MgO (1 wt% to 7 wt%) on Ni/SBA-15 (5 wt% to 15 wt% Ni) with the aim of enhancing catalytic activity, moreover, the influence of different feed ratios were also reported. It was reported that 10%Ni/3 wt% MgO/SBA-15 exhibited the higher catalytic activity (98.7% CH4 and 92.0% CO2 conversion) at the suitable feed ratio of CH4:CO2:H2O (2:1:1.5), respectively. Moreover, it was also noticed during the study that addition of MgO has strong influence over CO2 conversion compared to CH4 and this can be related to the basicity of MgO as CO2 is acidic in nature and it leads to enhance adsorption of CO2. However, with the increase in MgO content (>3%), an inverse effect over CO2 conversion was observed, as the number of active site decreased greatly due to the deep penetration of Ni2+ ions into the MgO lattice, which were difficult to reduce and lead to the decrease in reactants conversion.150,151
The catalysts applied for combined reforming of methane should have higher thermal stability as it requires higher inputs of energy due to endothermic reactions (DRM and SRM). Therefore, MgO proves to be a promising support as it has high thermal stability, reduces carbon deposition due to its basic nature and compatibility of MgO with NiO leads to the formation of NiO–MgO solid solution, which assisted in the achievement of higher catalytic activity and stability.20,26,152 Danilova et al.153 reported the application of Ni (1–5 wt%) catalyst supported on MgO (7–10 wt%) for combined reforming reaction (DRM and SRM) with feed composition such as: CH4:CO2:H2O:N2 = 35:23:39:3 vol%. The study indicated that 4%Ni/10%MgO exhibited higher methane conversion (60% stable up to 18 h) with the syn-gas ratio of 2.1–2.8, however, lower CO2 conversions were observed. This can be attributed to the high H2O content in the feed compared to CO2 as the higher steam concentration would lead to the dominance of SRM compared to DRM and in turn higher syn-gas ratios.
The influence of CeO2 promoter over Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/MgAl2O4 (MgO/Al2O3 ratios = 3 to 7) catalysts was investigated for combined DRM and SRM. In this study, Ni–Ce/MgAl2O4 (Mg/Al = 3) exhibited higher catalytic activity compared to Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/MgAl2O4 (Mg/Al = 3) with suitable syn-gas ratio (>2).154 The higher catalyst performance can be dedicated to the higher coke resistance of promoted catalyst and TGA exhibited lower weight for Ni–Ce/MgAl2O4 (Mg/Al = 3). Moreover, promoted catalysts exhibited higher resistance to agglomeration, better interactions of CeO2 and MgAl2O4 lead to higher dispersion of Ni particles. Similar results were reported by Koo et al.155 in which Ni–Ce/MgAl2O4 catalyst with different Ce/Ni ratio (0.0–1.0) was investigated for the combined reforming reaction. It was observed that Ce/Ni ratio of 0.25 was suitable choice and can be justified on the basis of higher metal dispersion (4.91%), smaller crystalline NiO peaks (8.3 nm) and lower coke deposition (8.0%) compared to Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst with Ce/Ni = 0 exhibiting lower metal dispersion (3.49%), higher crystalline NiO size (11.0 nm) and higher coke deposition (25.5%). The higher catalytic activity of Ni–Ce/MgAl2O4 can be dedicated the enhanced basic sites as depicted by TPD-CO2 results in Fig. 6A. The high intensity of strong basic sites for Ni–Ce/MgAl2O4 can be described by the shift of TPD peaks from lower temperatures to higher temperature. Moreover, TGA analysis of Ni–Ce/MgAl2O4 with different Ce/Ni ratios (0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0) indicated lower weight loss for Ce/Ni = 2.5 (Fig. 6B). Therefore, it can be deduced that the addition of Ce to Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst enhanced stability, activity and enhanced coke deposition resistance.

Moreover, Ryi et al.156 investigated the influence of CO2/H2O molar ratio (0–1.0) at different temperatures (627 °C to 767 °C) on reactants conversion and H2/CO ratio. The influence of CO2/H2O ratio was not much prominent at temperature above ≥700 °C and this can be related to the endothermic nature of both reactions indicating that the activation energies of both reforming process (DRM and SRM) were sufficient at 700 °C (Fig. 7a). However, the activation energy for DRM was not sufficient at lower temperatures (650 °C), which matched with another thermodynamic study on DRM reporting that spontaneous reaction cannot be achieved below 640 °C.157 In the combined reforming process, it was encountered that there are many side reactions occurring during the completion of reforming process, such as: SRM (eqn (2)), DRM (eqn (8)), methane decomposition (eqn (5)), carbon gasification (C + 2H2O → CO2 + 2H2) Boudouard reaction (eqn (6)), WGS reaction (eqn (3)) and RWGS reaction (eqn (10)). In the above reactions, CO2 is a reactant in DRM, reverse Boudouard reaction, and RWGS, and appears as a product in WGS and carbon gasification reaction. In Fig. 7b, negative CO2 conversion indicates the dominance of WGS reaction over DRM reaction, however, with the increase of CO2/H2O there was an increase in CO2 conversion and indicates the dominance of DRM reaction. In Fig. 7c indicates the influence of CO2/H2O ratio over syn-gas ratio (H2/CO) and it was observed that the increase in reactants molar ratio leads to the decrease in H2/CO ratio indicating the dominance of DRM reaction at higher CO2/H2O ratios and vice versa at lower CO2/H2O ratios.

On industrial scale gas to liquid (GTL) processes, high pressures are applied for the conversion of syn-gas to dimethyl ether (DME) and methanol; therefore, it was practical to perform combined DRM and SRM reaction at higher pressures from economical point of view. Özkara-Aydinoğlu et al.158 investigated the influence of high pressures (1 bar and 20 bar) on combined DRM and SRM reaction at two temperatures (800 and 1000 °C) with different feed ratios (CH4:CO2:H2O = 1/1/1/, 1/1/2, 1/1/3). The study revealed that combined reforming reaction exhibited higher methane conversion (almost 100%) at 1 bar and 800 °C for all feed ratios, however, the increase of pressure (1 bar to 20 bar) leads to the decrease in methane conversion. The increase in steam concentration (CH4/CO2/H2O = 1/1/1 to 1/13) in the feed composition leads to the increase in methane conversion (56% to 75%) at high pressure (20 bar). The author reported no significant influence of pressure (1 bar and 20 bar) on methane conversion or syn-gas ratio at high temperature (1000 °C) with similar feed ratios. This study indicated that the influence of pressure (1 bar and 20 bar) on methane conversion or H2/CO ratio is more significant at low temperature (800 °C); however, the influence of pressure shift was minimal at high temperature (1000 °C).
Nakoua et al.159 studied the addition of promoter (Ba, Cr, and La2O3) on Ni/Al2O3, effect of pressure (1–20 bar) and different flow rates of methane (0.4 to 1.0 mol h−1), H2O (1.0 to 2.25 mol h−1) and CO2 (0.2 to 0.53 mol h−1) on the combined reforming process. In this study, two types of catalysts were prepared Ni(49%)/Al2O3(51%) (Catalyst A) and Ni(33%)–Cr(56%)–Ba(11%)/La2O3(19%)–Al2O3(31.4%) (Catalyst B). It was reported that with the increase of H2O/CH4 ratio from 1.67 to 2.5 resulted in the increase of methane conversion (85% to 93%). It was reported that both DRM and SRM reaction are favored at low pressure, meaning any pressure above the atmospheric pressure would lead to the decrease in maximum possible reactants conversion due to molar expansion. The applied pressure near the equilibrium position will shift the equilibrium to the left leading to the decrease in reactants conversion. The partial pressure of H2O and CO2 in the reforming system should be adjusted such that both reactions (DRM and SRM) proceed at the same rate and reaction expression for such system can be expressed by the following eqn (14). CH4 + 1/3CO2 + 2/3H2O → 4/3CO + 8/3H2(14)
The study indicated the decrease of methane conversion with the increase of pressure (1–20 bar) as depicted in Fig. 8a. However, a favorable syn-gas ratio (2.20) for the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis was observed at 700 °C and 3 bar. The addition of steam leads to the decrease in CO2 conversion due to the competition of the H2O and CO2 molecules for active sites, however, there was seen an increase in stability of catalyst (140 h) and minimization of carbon deposition for catalyst B. Moreover, Fig. 8b describes the change of pressure from 0 to 42 psi g after 25 h time on stream and indicated the decrease of reactants conversion with the increase of pressure.

3.5. Combination of SRM and POX
In this section, combination of SRM and POX regarded as auto-thermal reforming (ATR) will be investigated with the aim of reducing heat requirements, minimize carbon deposition, better control over syn-gas and reducing the risk of hot spots formation.160 The previous studies revealed that such combination of exothermic and endothermic reactions will not require any external heat source,161 as the energy produced by exothermic reaction will be utilized in endothermic reactions and the equilibrium production composition and temperature will be dependent on the feed ratios (H2O:CH4 and O2:CH4). The industrial gas industry has in the last decade has shown increasing interest in ATR for commercial production of H2 and CO or CO-rich mixtures. The desired syn-gas ratio composition for Fisher Tropsch synthesis or methanol synthesis is often characterized by an H2/CO ratio of 2. This ratio cannot be obtained by the ATR process alone except at very low S/C ratio and by adjusting the preheat temperature. Moreover, the other possible route is by recycling a small amount of CO2. Large attention has been drawn on industrial scale to optimize S/C ratio in ATR process, which in turn leads to the production of suitable syn-gas ratio and improved efficiency for GTL plants. For several years, industrial operation for ATR process was conducted at S/C = 1.4. However, further studies reported the optimized ratio of S/C (0.6) and have been demonstrated in an industrial reactor. Today ATR appears to be the cheapest solution fulfilling the optimum requirements of the MeOH and FT-syntheses.12 Moreover, such a plant based on S/C ratio of 0.6 has been commercialized by Haldor Topsøe A/S (Topsøe) and a plant in Europe has been in commercial operation. Moreover, ATR process will be favored for large capacity plants of about 6000 MTPD.162
Furthermore, the key controlling elements of the performance and efficiency of the ATR process depends strongly on the catalyst type, structure and composition. The catalysts function in the process is to equilibrate syn-gas and destroy soot formation. Moreover, the catalyst should be able to withstand high temperature and steam partial pressure. The more important feature of catalyst is its small particle size to avoid pressure drop, minimize the influence of sintering and have high catalytic activity.163 Therefore, various studies were conducted to synthesize suitable catalysts by the application of suitable supports, combination of different active metals and promoters. Takeguchi et al.164 investigated the application of several catalysts for combined reforming process and reported their catalytic activity such as: Ni/(CaO)0.09(ZrO2)0.91 > Ni/ZrO2 > Ni/Al2O3. Moreover, addition of CeO2 over Ni/CaO–ZrO2 enhanced catalyst performance and Ni/(CaO)0.09(CeO2)0.05(ZrO2)0.86 catalyst exhibited higher methane conversion amongst all the other catalyst combinations Ni/ZrO2, Ni/Al2O3, Ni/(CaO)0.09(ZrO2)0.91, Ni/(CaO)0.09(CeO2)0.01(ZrO2)0.90 and Ni/(CaO)0.09(CeO2)0.13(ZrO2)0.78. XRD profiles indicated the presence of small NiO crystalline size for Ni/(CaO)0.09(CeO2)0.05(ZrO2)0.86 compared to Ni/(CaO)0.09(ZrO2)0.91 and Ni/(CaO)0.09(CeO2)0.01(ZrO2)0.90, which exhibited higher crystalline peaks for NiO facilitating the sintering of Ni particles. TPR-H2 profiles for Ni/(CaO)0.09(CeO2)0.05(ZrO2)0.86 exhibited the shift of reduction peak to high temperature (NiO > 320 °C) leading to the conclusion that there was strong metal–support interaction. The application of Ni/ZrO2 catalyst in DRM reaction has exhibited significant results and this can be dedicated to the zirconia support having higher thermal stability and it acidic basic characteristics.165–167 Therefore, based on the promising results from previous studies, Roh et al.168 studied the application of Ni/ZrO2 catalyst for combined SRM and POX reaction and also reported the addition of CeO2 promoter. In this study, Ni/Ce–ZrO2 catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity (99.1% methane conversion stable up to 100 h) compared to SRM and POX alone. Moreover, the catalytic activity of Ni/Ce–ZrO2 was higher compared to Ni/ZrO2, Ni/CeO2 and Ni/MgAl2O4 catalysts. The higher catalyst performance of Ni/Ce–ZrO2 can be ascribed to the addition of ceria, which enhanced the concentration of highly mobile oxygen species and also form a highly thermal stable solid solution with ZrO2. TPR-H2 profile indicated the easier reducibility of Ni/Ce–ZrO2, which leads to more highly oxygen species via a redox cycle and also enhanced decoking activity of the catalyst through the participation of lattice oxygen. Ni/Ce–ZrO2 (254.7 µmol g−1-sample) has higher oxygen species compared to MgO (3.36), ZrO2 (5.25) and CeO2 (251.5), however, MgAl2O4 did not exhibit any mobile oxygen species. It was suggested that Ni/Ce–ZrO2 catalyst structure composed of different layers in which the upper layer consist of Ni particle and there exists a special structure Ni–Ce–Zr–Ox, between the upper layer and support (Ce–ZrO2), due to the strong metal and support interactions (Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  Conceptual trilateral catalyst structure of Ni/Ce–ZrO2.168 
The application of oxygen ion conducting materials such as CeO2, ZrO2 and TiO2, which own oxygen vacancies, has strong influence over the metal–support interaction. This can be dedicated to the interaction of the surface oxygen vacancies of the support with the supported Ni.169 It was suggested that H2O dissociates over the oxygen conducting supportH2O + * → H2 + O*whereas * denotes an active site over Ni or oxygen vacancy over ceria and O* denotes the adsorbed oxygen species over Ni or an occupied oxygen vacancy. It was reported that produced oxygen species promotes the autocatalytic H2O dissociationH2O + * + O* → H2 + 2O*
Moreover, the surface O species produced by H2O dissociation lead to the lower rate of carbon formation due to the interfacial reaction of carbon species with surface O species such asCHx + O → CO + xH
Huang et al.169 reported that the catalysts without oxygen conducting materials CeO2 has a much higher carbon formation such as Ni/γ-Al2O3 and it was dedicated to the absence of surface oxygen species.
In this study, Dantas et al.170 investigated the influence of various promoters (Ag, Fe, Pt, Pd) over Ni/CeZrO2 catalyst applied for combined reforming process (SRM + POX). Among all the series of catalysts prepared, Ag promoted catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity (55% methane conversion) and stable up to 25 h. This can be related with the ability of silver to modify catalyst structure and this is evident from TRP-H2 and TPD profiles, which indicates higher reducibility and redox properties of Ag promoted catalyst. In previous DRM studies, it was concluded that the addition of noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh) on monometallic Ni catalysts exhibited higher catalytic activity and stabilities compared to monometallic catalysts.109,145,171,172 Therefore, Li et al.173 investigated the addition of noble metal (Pt) on monometallic Ni catalysts and also adopted two different methods for the addition of Pt such as: sequential impregnation (Pt/Ni) and co-impregnation method (Pt–Ni). The study indicated that addition of Pt by sequential method (Pt/Ni) is more effective to locate Pt on the surface to form Pt–Ni alloy compared to co-impregnation method (Pt–Ni). Moreover, it was reported that addition of Pt to Ni/Al2O3 leads to enhanced catalyst activity due to the decreased Ni oxidation rates near the bed inlet and this keeps Pt–Ni in metallic sites, which enhances the catalyst performance compared to monometallic Ni/Al2O3.
All the previous studies on combined reforming were done at atmospheric pressure; however, there was lack of studies regarding the influence of high pressure on the combined reforming performance. In this framework, Chen et al.160 investigated the influence of high pressure (15 bar) and feed ratios (H2O/CH4 and O2/CH4) on combined reforming. The study of different H2O/CH4 ratios at 1 bar and 15 bar indicated that with the increase of H2O/CH4 ratio there was an increase in methane conversion, and H2/CO ratio, however, a decrease in CO selectivity was observed and this can be dedicated to the dominance of SRM. Moreover, the decrease of CO selectivity can be related to the occurrence of WGS reaction, which utilizes some part of the produced CO to enhance H2 yield. However, the shift of reforming process to higher pressure (from 1 bar to 15 bar) indicates that it requires higher H2O/CH4 ratio (2.0) to achieve thermodynamic methane conversion (90% methane conversion) compared to lower pressure reforming, where it requires lower H2O/CH4 ratio (0.75) to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium methane conversion (98%) and produces high H2 yield (2.2 mol) compared to high pressure reforming (1.3 mol of H2 at 15 bar) as depicted in Fig. 10. The study on the influence of O2/CH4 indicates that methane conversion was increased with the increase of O2/CH4 ratio, while H2 yield; CO selectivity and syn-gas ratio was decreased. This can related with the dominance of POX compared to SRM. The investigation on thermal efficiency indicated that combined reforming was more thermally efficient process (55.6%) compared to POX, which gives only 35.8% thermal efficiency. The investigation on the various aspects of reforming process indicates that combined reforming of methane is more suitable in terms of methane conversion, thermal efficiency and moreover, assisted in the minimization of carbon formation dramatically at elevated pressures. The addition of steam has strong influence in the minimization of carbon deposition only 2.7 wt% was observed for combined reforming process, while POX depicted 6.7 wt% of carbon deposition. Moreover, the catalysts employed for combination of reforming process alone with their reaction conditions, feed ratios, reactants conversion and syn-gas ratio are listed in Table 1.
 Fig. 10  Effect of steam to CH4 ratio on (a) methane conversion at reaction conditions (750 °C, 1 bar, 8000 mL gcat−1 h−1, CH4:O2:N2 = 1:0.5:1.887) and (b) methane conversion at reaction conditions (850 °C, 15 bar, 8000 mL gcat−1 h−1, CH4:O2:N2 = 1:0.5:1.887).160 
Different types of catalyst were applied for the combined reforming process with the aim of achieving higher catalyst performance, however, the application of basic metal oxides (MgO, ZrO2) both as a support material and promoter leads to the better catalyst performance. Moreover, the addition of cerium oxide (CeO2) as a promoter for different catalysts leads to superior catalyst properties, particularly for Ni/Ce–ZrO2 catalyst, which was studied extensively for the combined reforming processes. The attractiveness of this catalyst can be related to the higher oxygen storage capacity (OSC), highly thermal stable (ZrO2 support), enhanced metal–support interaction and formation of large number of mobile oxygen. From the studies on the combined reforming processes (DRM + POX, DRM + SRM, SRM + POX), it can be concluded safely that combined reforming processes are more economical, environmental friendly and with adjustable syn-gas ratio and minimized risk of carbon formation. The choice of reforming process will affect the thermal efficiency of the plant, plant size and location, plant capital cost, the need for oxygen plant or oxygen enriched facilities, the physical size of downstream gas handling equipment, syn-gas composition and the downstream conversion process. Moreover, the investigations on the ATR process reveal higher performance and feasibility for large scale plants. Moreover, the combination of exothermic and endothermic reactions (SRM + POX) will lead to thermo-neutral process. However, this process still faces the challenges of the availability of low cost oxygen as discussed earlier in the POX section. The availability of low cost oxygen will have a direct impact on the production cost of syn-gas and will enhance the attractiveness of the ATR process.
3.6. Methanol synthesis via tri-reforming
Technologies for CO2 conversion and utilization are an essential part of chemical research to attain the goal of sustainable environment, moreover, CO2 being an important source of carbon for fuels and as a chemical feedstock in the future.98,174,175 Flue gases from electricity power plants are considered to be a major source of CO2 and flue gases from NG fired power plants contain 8–10% CO2, 18–20% H2O, 2–3% O2 and 67–72%N2. However, coal fired boilers may have little different proportions 12–14% CO2, 8–10% H2O and 3–5% O2 and 72–77% N2.176 Extensive research is focused on the separation of pure CO2 from its sources, by absorption, adsorption or membrane process,177 however, these processes require substantial amount of energy and are quite expensive.178–182 It was estimated that 90% CO2 capture in the flue gas by amine absorption system leads to the loss of total power plant electricity output by 30% and the CO2 capture cost per ton was around %40–100. The high energy demand by CO2 capture system leads to the increase of electricity cost in the range of 50–90% based on the 90% CO2 capture.181
The different reforming combinations discussed in the above section lacks the direct application of these processes to existing facilities such as flue gases from fuel fired power plants, because it will require pre-separation steps. Therefore, tri-reforming process which is a combination of SRM, POX and DRM utilizes the feed sources (e.g., flue gases) without CO2 pre-separation to produce suitable syn-gas ratio for methanol synthesis.176 In the proposed tri-reforming process, CO2 conversion is executed by mixing flue gas with NG and the advantage is the utilization of waste heat in the power plant and in situ heat generation by O2 oxidation.176 The proposed concept of tri-reforming of NG for the production of syn-gas using flue gases is depicted in Fig. 11.
 Fig. 11  Conceptual block diagram of tri-reforming of natural gas.176 
The combination of SRM and POX with DRM generates heat in situ as POX is exothermic in nature, which will reduce the energy requirements and in turn enhance energy efficiency.176,183 Moreover, addition of O2 will assist in the reduction or elimination of carbon formation on the reforming catalysts. Overall, tri-reforming process leads to the increased catalyst life, process efficiency176 and has low energy requirements and lesser amounts of CO2 emissions to produce syn-gas (1.5–2.0) compared to DRM and SRM.175 Song and Pan176 investigated the series of catalysts for tri-reforming with feed composition CH4:CO2:H2O:O2 = 1:0.48:0.54:0.1 at 700–850 °C and reported their catalytic activity in terms of CO2 conversion the following trend: Ni/MgO > Ni/MgO/CeZrO > Ni/CeO2 ≈ Ni/ZrO2 ≈ Ni/Al2O3 > Ni/CeZrO. The higher catalytic activity of Ni/MgO catalyst can be ascribed to the influence of strong metal–support interaction and basicity of support, which leads to the better CO2 adsorption. However, as syn-gas ratio (H2/CO) depends strongly on the H2O and CO2 conversion, the higher H2O conversion leads to the higher syn-gas ratio. Therefore, the trend for syn-gas ratios was different compared to CO2 trend and it was reported that higher syn-gas ratio were obtained for Ni/CeZrO, while Ni/CeO2, Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/Al2O3 exhibited the similar syn-gas ratio. However, Ni/MgO depicted the lower syn-gas ratio due to its basicity. It was reported that higher catalytic activity (97% CH4 and 80% CO2 conversion) and syn-gas ratios of 1.5–2.0 can be achieved at higher temperature 800–850 °C for Ni supported catalysts. Minutillo and Perna184 described a novel approach to capture and utilize CO2 from flue gases emitted by fossil fired power plant. This strategy is based on the concept of utilizing flue gases as a co-reactant in a catalytic process regarded as tri-reforming process to produce syn-gas with a suitable ratio for the methanol and DME synthesis. They proposed an integrated system referred as integrated tri-reforming power plant (ITRPP) composed of a power island and a methane tri-reforming island. In tri-reforming system, the exhaust from the power plant is reacted with methane to produce suitable syn-gas ratio for methanol synthesis. However, power island consists of two types of turbines: steam turbine power plant utilizes coal as fuel (ITRPP-SC) and a gas turbine combined cycle fuelled with NG (ITRPP-CC) (Fig. 12). In this study, different thermochemical and thermodynamic models were applied to calculate the syn-gas composition, energy and mass balances and CO2 emission from each integrated system.
 Fig. 12  Block diagram for the (a) ITRPP-SC and (b) ITRPP-CC.184 
In both configurations of power plants, flue gases were sent to the reforming reactor, where it was reacted with methane and the syn-gas from reactor leaves at high temperatures. A heat recover system (HRS) was installed to bring the temperature in the suitable range for methanol synthesis. The recovered heat can be utilized to produce high pressure steam, which was recycled to the steam turbine to produce additional electrical power and makes the process economical and more attractive. However, the analysis showed that the suitable syn-gas ratio (H2/CO = 2) is impossible to achieve from ITRPP-SC and to overcome this problem, water was added (Fig. 12a). The main feature of this ITRPP is the reduction in CO2 emission, which was estimated to be 83% (15.4 vs. 93.4 kg GJFuelinput−1) for ITRPP-SC and 84% (8.9 vs. 56.2 kg GJFuelinput−1) for ITRPP-CC. This integrated system showed convincing results in terms of reduction of CO2 emission, energy requirements and energy recovery compared to conventional CO2 capture techniques in power plants, where ammines are applied for chemical adsorption of CO2. The drawbacks of the CO2 capture process are the higher energy demand to regenerate the solvent, consequently, the energy will be supplied by power plant indicating the fact that CO2 effectively avoided is less that of captured. However, in the integrated system, there are no such surplus energy requirements.
Halmann and Steinfeld185 reported on the utilization of flue gases from coal and NG fired power plants by tri-reforming process to produce syn-gas with the aim of production of useful products such as methanol, hydrogen and ammonia or urea. This study emphasized on the advantages of this process in terms of CO2 emission reduction, fuel saving, economic viability and energy efficiency. The analysis of flue gas from coal fired plant indicated that it consists of CO2, H2O, O2 and N2 in the ratio of 13:9:4:74, respectively,186 however, to adjust suitable molar ratio of constituents it requires addition of CH4, H2O and air (20, 11 and 24 parts, respectively). The final composition of flue gases will be treated at 727 °C (1000 K) and 1 atm. 13CO2 + 20H2O + 9O2 + 20 CH4 + 93N2 = 12.79CO2 + 18.30H2O + 20.12CO + 41.49H2 + 0.09CH4 + 93N2(15)
The syn-gas ratio was around 2.06, which is deemed suitable for the production of methanol and Fischer–Tropsch syntheses. CO2 emissions based on a conventional 45% efficient 500 MW coal fired power plant were reported to be 0.75 ton CO2 MW−1 h−1, which are around 3.29 × 106 ton CO2 per annum. According to the eqn (15) describing tri-reforming, 98.4% of the flue gas CO2 (∼3.24 × 106 ton per annum) would be released. Assuming 90% overall yield in the conversion of CO in the syn-gas to methanol, would produce 3.33 × 106 tons of methanol per annum, which makes around 8.5% of the current worldwide capacity for methanol. However, to achieve similar production of methanol (3.33 × 106 tons) from conventional SRM, would lead to 2.79 × 106 ton of CO2, and the addition of untreated CO2 (3.29 × 106) from flue gas around would lead to total emission of CO2 around 6.08 × 106 ton CO2 per year. Therefore, the overall CO2 emission avoidance by the application of tri-reforming and production of methanol synthesis would be around 46.7% compared to conventional SRM route. Further studies on the flue gases composition (CO2:H2O:O2:N2 = 9:19:2.5:69.5) from NG fired power plant186 and addition of NG and air (15 and 19 parts) leads to the final composition such as: 9CO2 + 19H2O + 6.8O2 + 15CH4 + 85.6N2 = 8.71CO2 + 17.89H2O + 15.29CO + 31.1H2 + 0.003CH4 + 85.6N2(16)
The syn-gas ratio (H2/CO) was 2.03, moreover, calculations based on conventional 49% efficient 400 MW NG fired power plant indicates that around 1.47 × 106 ton of CO2 will be emitted per year (0.42 ton CO2 MW−1 h−1).187 According to eqn (16), 96.8% of CO2 would be emitted by tri-reforming, which is around 1.42 × 106. Similar assumption for methanol production (90% yield), indicates that it would produce around 1.635 × 106 ton methanol per annum. The production of similar amounts of methanol with conventional SRM would lead to higher CO2 emissions 2.84 × 106 ton CO2 per year compared to tri-reforming process (1.42 × 106 ton CO2 per year). This indicates that tri-reforming of the flue gas followed by the methanol synthesis has CO2 emission avoidance of around 50.0% compared to conventional SRM route. The comparison of both processes based on different process parameters are listed in Table 2.

However, there was a lack of study focusing on the economics analysis of tri-reforming to describe the attractiveness of this process. Therefore, a recent study was conducted to predict the minimization of utility and capital costs with the application of heat integration on tri-reforming process.188 The heat exchange network (HEN) proposed for minimization utility and capital costs, leads to 34.3% and 32.2% energy saving for methanol production system. After heat integration, the specific energy requirement for CO2 capture was reduced from 29.0 kW h kg−1 CO2 (before integration) to 19.0 kW h kg−1 CO2 (after integration). The comparison of tri-reforming with steam CO2 reforming process (SCM) indicates that the later requires lesser specific energy (11.5 kW h kg−1 CO2) compared to tri-reforming (19.0 kW h). However, this drawback was compensated by higher methanol production (2.75 kg per kg CO2) for tri-reforming process compared to SCM. Tri-reforming process coupled with methanol production can be considered as an attractive option for the long term global management of carbon. The comparison of utility costs and annual profits before and after heat integration shown in (million dollar US) is depicted in Fig. 13.

Moreover, Zhang et al.189 investigated the operating cost, utility usage, energy savings for combined process (SRM, DRM and POX) and compared it with conventional SRM. In this study, syn-gas production was coupled with CO2 separation system; here amine based CO2 absorption was applied to separated CO2 from water. The overall mass balance of the SRM and combined process to achieve production rate of 300 kmol h−1 of syn-gas accompanied with suitable ratio, is exhibited in Fig. 14.
 Fig. 14  The overall mass balance of (a) SRM and (b) combined process.189 
The hydrogen production in combined process was small (98 kmol h−1) compared to SRM (588.9 kmol h−1). However, it can be seen that CO2 produced by combined process was less (34.6 kmol h−1) compared to SRM (122.1 kmol h−1). These results suggested that combined reforming process was more efficient in the regard that at similar syn-gas production rate, CO2 emissions were less due to recycling of CO2 in the combined process. Moreover, the detailed analysis of the utility usage by each component in the process indicates that there are 31.2% energy savings with the combined process compared to reference SRM. These energy savings for the combined process can be related to the lower raw materials requirements compared to SRM, which requires large raw materials. Another benefit of combined process is the lower utility costs compared to reference SRM and leads to 24.3% utility cost savings. This high utility cost for SRM can be related to its high heating and cooling requirement compared to combine process. Moreover, total operating cost (TOC) highlighted the better performance of combined process compared to SRM in Fig. 15. This indicates that cost of raw materials is high for SRM compared to combined process and can be related to the CO2 recycled in the process. However, SRM has higher H2 credit compared with combined process, but the high cost of raw materials and utilities has a bigger impact on TOC and leads to the increase in TOC for SRM process. Therefore, this study leads to the conclusion that combined process is more economically attractive, more feasible, environmental friendly and lower operating costs. This suggests that tri-reforming process is a suitable option to treat CO2 effectively and minimize its emissions.

The discussions in the above studies were focused on the economic analysis, energy efficiency, and feasibility of the tri-reforming process. However, an important section of the system, suitable catalysts for tri-reforming was not discussed yet. Therefore, the following section will discuss in detail the influence of different types of active metal, support materials, promoters and the effect of feed gas ratios (H2O/CH4, O2/CH4) on the syn-gas ratio. It has been suggested that the catalyst employed for tri-reforming must have certain feature such as: high surface area, high OSC, good redox properties, resistance to carbon deposition and metal sintering.190
García-Vargas et al.191 investigated the effect of different active metal precursors with different supports and their influence on catalyst activity, stability, and carbon deposition was reported. Different Ni metal precursors such as: acetate (A), nitrate (N), chloride (C) and citrate (Ci) and two types of support CeO2 (C) and SiC (S) were employed and the catalyst combinations were denoted as Ni-AC, Ni-NC, Ni-CC, Ni-CiC and Ni-AS, Ni-NS, Ni-CS, Ni-CiS. In this study, a mixture of reactants CH4:CO2:H2O:O2 = 1/0.5/0.5/0.1 at 800 °C was employed for the different catalysts. The higher catalytic activity, stability, lower carbon deposition and high syn-gas ratio (H2/CO) was obtained for Ni-AS and Ni-NS due to higher metal dispersion and smaller Ni particles, which are considered an important factor for achieving higher activity and reducing carbon deposition. However, Ni-AC, Ni-NC, produced large metal particles. Moreover, the lower carbon deposition of Ni-AS and Ni-NS was linked with the strong metal–support interactions revealed by TPR results. The lower syn-gas ratio in case of CeO2 supported catalyst were dedicated to high basicity of CeO2, which leads to enhance CO2 adsorption and in turn leads to lower H2/CO ratio compared to SiC. Therefore, it was concluded that Ni/β-SiC catalyst coupled with acetate and nitrate precursor can be considered as promising catalyst for tri-reforming.
Sun et al.192 investigated the effect of O2 and H2O addition on biogas (60–65% methane and 40–35% carbon dioxide) to produce syn-gas in the presence of Ni/SBA-15 catalyst and mixture of feed gas (CH4, CO2, H2O and O2) in different molar ratios. The search for the suitable O2 molar ratio (CH4:CO2:O2 = 2:1:X, where X = 0–1) in feed gas leads to the conclusion that O2 addition has different effects on CH4 and CO2 conversion. Methane conversion was increased from 65.1% to 86.3% for X = 0.4, and reached to 99.1% for X = 1.0. This suggests that addition of O2 could promote the conversion of CH4 but had a contrary effect on the conversion of CO2, when X > 0.6 the CO2 conversion decrease rapidly and for X = 1.0, CO2 conversion decrease from 87.1% to 66.0%. Similar profile was reported for the addition of steam (CH4:CO2:O2:H2O = 2:1:0.6:Y, where Y = 0–1) in the feed gas as discussed above for O2 addition (Fig. 16). Therefore, feed gas CH4:CO2:O2:H2O = 2:1:0.6:0.6 exhibited higher catalytic activity (92.8% CH4 and 76.3% CO2 conversion), syn-gas ratio (1.35) and stable up to 100 h at 800 °C.
 Fig. 16  The effect of the added oxygen (a) and steam (b) on the catalytic performance.192 
In the above studies, lower syn-gas ratios were obtained,192,193 however another study reported the application of Ni–MgO–(Ce, Zr)O2 catalyst for tri-reforming and produced higher syn-gas ratio (>2).190 The higher catalytic activity and syn-gas ratio can be ascribed to the high OSC produced by the presence of CeO2,164,194 moreover, the addition of ZrO2 to CeO2 eventually enhanced OSC, thermal stability, high metal dispersion and redox properties.168,195–199 Moreover, basic oxides (MgO and ZrO2) assisted in the enhancement of carbon deposition resistance due to enhanced basic sites of the catalyst. These basic sites will have higher CO2 and H2O adsorption capacity and will result in higher CO2 conversion and H2 production.176,200 It was reported that each reactant has a different influence on the tri-reforming reaction. While, O2 has high affinity for active sites and in turn leads to higher O2 conversion, however, H2O and CO2 compete with each other for active sites, increase in H2O molar ratio produced high H2/CO ratio. This can be attributed to the high H2O adsorption on active sites attenuating CO2 adsorption to produce high H2/CO ratio. However, there lies a certain limit after which higher H2O molar ratio leads to a decrease in CO2 reforming. The major goal of tri-reforming is to achieve high CO2 conversion, which make process environmental friendly and improved efficient for the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis for liquid hydrocarbons. Therefore, it is required to perform tri-reforming process at certain H2O concentrations, which does not affect CO2 conversions and maintaining the high syn-gas ratio (∼2).
Sun et al.183 studied Ni–MgO–ZrO2 catalyst for tri-reforming with feed gas composition as, CH4:CO2:H2O:O2:N2 = 1/0.45/0.45/0.1/0.4 and produced syn-gas ratio (H2/CO) of 1.5. The influence of H2O/CO2 and O2/CO2 ratios on reactants conversion matched with the above explained phenomenon,190 indicating that increase of H2O led to the decrease in CO2 conversion and high H2/CO ratio and similar trend was observed for O2/CO2 ratios. The increase in O2/CO2 ratio, increased H2/CO from 1.1 to 1.4 and this can be attributed to the higher occurrence of POX compared to DRM. However, in this study (Ni–MgO–ZrO2) lower syn-gas ratio was achieved compared to NiMg–Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 (>2),190 which probably can be attributed to the absence of CeO2, because all the other process parameters are same for both studies (preparation methods (co-precipitation) and reaction temperatures (800 °C)).
Jiang et al.201 investigated Ni/MgxTi1−xO (x = 0–1), Ni/TiO2 and Ni/MgO catalysts for tri-reforming with feed gas of composition as, CH4:CO2:H2O:O2 = 1:0.48:0.54:0.1 at 850 °C. The catalytic activity and stability for the catalysts were such as: Ni/Mg0.25Ti0.75O ≈ Ni/TiO2 < Ni/MgO < Ni/Mg0.75Ti0.25O ≈ Ni/Mg0.5Ti0.5O. The lower stability of Ni/Mg0.25Ti0.75O and Ni/TiO2 was dedicated to the formation of stable graphitic carbon (γ-C) deposits, which is difficult to be oxidized by the oxidants (H2O and O2) in the feed compared to α-C and β-C, which are easily oxidized. However, Ni/MgO catalyst showed higher resistance towards carbon deposition and no γ-C was formed due to strong metal–support interaction between Nio and MgO. Therefore, re-oxidation of Nio (formation of NiO) leads to the difficulty in reducing Ni/MgO solid solution and in turn Nio active sites gradually decreased leading to lower CH4 and CO2 conversion. However, Ni/Mg0.5Ti0.5O and Ni/Mg0.75Ti0.25O exhibited no graphitic carbon peaks and no carbon fibers were found, however, a re-oxidation phenomenon occurs but different compared to Ni/MgO. In this re-oxidation phenomenon, the formation of Ni2+ (re-oxidation of Nio) was exhibited for Ni/Mg0.5Ti0.5O and Ni/Mg0.75Ti0.25O catalysts, which can be easily reduced by produced H2 and CO compared to Ni/MgO (as confirmed by TPR profile Fig. 17), leaving the number of active sites constant. This leads to the higher stability and catalytic activity for this pair of catalysts. TPR profiles indicate the shift of reduction peaks to higher temperature with the increase of x value (0–1) for Ni/MgxTi1−xO and the reduction peak for Ni/MgO become broader and smaller compared to Ni/TiO2.

Pino et al.200 investigated the effect of dopant lanthana (La) over Ni–CeO2 catalyst and reported that modified catalyst have higher activity and stability (96% CH4 and 86.5% CO2 conversion) compared to unmodified catalyst Ni–CeO2 (93% CH4 and 83% CO2 conversion). It was attributed to the formation of Ce3+ ions arising from the strong interaction between nickel–lanthana–surface oxygen vacancies of ceria, which leads to higher metal dispersion and promotes catalytic activity. Moreover, the production of intermediate and strong basic sites leads to enhanced CO2 chemisorption due to its acidic nature and in turn produced higher catalytic activities. Similar results were reported for tri-reforming over Ni/La–Ce–O with the feed gas (CH4:CO2:H2O:O2 = 1:0.66:0.66:0.10) at 800 °C by Pino et al.193 The study reported higher reactants conversion rates for CH4 and CO2 (1.56 and 0.56 mmol s−1 gNi−1, respectively) stable up to 150 h and syn-gas ratio of 1.57 was obtained for Ni/La–Ce–O.
There are various studies focusing over the synthesis of novel catalysts for tri-reforming to achieve higher catalytic activity and stability, however, their comparison with commercial catalysts is essential to justify their enhanced benefits. It was reported in previous studies that NiO–YSZ–CeO2 (ref. 202 and 203) exhibited higher catalytic activity for DRM compared to NiO–YSZ–MgO. Kang et al.204 investigated the combination of YSZ–CeO2 supported over Ni for tri-reforming and compared their catalytic activity with commercial HT (Holder Topsoe) catalyst. It was reported that synthesized catalyst exhibited higher CO2 conversion compared to commercial HT catalyst, moreover, the analysis of outgases indicates the traces of CH4 and CO2 (<1%) for NiO–YSZ–CeO2 compared to HT catalysts exhibiting 0.5–1.5% CH4 and 9–11% CO2. The higher catalytic activity and stability of NiO–YSZ–CeO2 was attributed to the higher carbon resistance (absence of NiC) confirmed by XRD (Fig. 18A). Moreover, TEM image (Fig. 18B) indicated the presence of Ni metal particles in dark spots (<10 nm) and gray parts depicts the presence of YSZ support, however, there was no significant amount of carbon deposition.

Solov'ev et al.205 investigated tri-reforming and reported that addition of O2 favored the occurrence of endothermic reactions (SRM and DRM) due to the formation of hot zones on the surface of catalyst. In this study, modification effect of rare earth metals (La, Ce) was investigated for Ni/Al catalyst. The unmodified catalyst Ni/Al showed higher methane conversion (100%) for combined SRM and DRM reaction, however, the addition of O2 lead to the drastic decrease in the methane conversion. This can be attributed to the oxidized Ni present under these conditions and exhaustive oxidation of methane occurring on its surface. However, modified catalyst (NiLaAl) exhibited higher catalytic activity (98% to 100% methane conversion) for tri-reforming process. As depicted in Table 3, higher concentrations of O2 leads to the increase in methane conversion and syn-gas ratio accompanied a decrease in CO2 conversion. Similar effects were observed for NiCeAl, however, on the whole, NiLaAl exhibited a better catalytic activity and higher syn-gas ratio (H2/CO = 2.5) compared to NiCeAl (H2/CO = 2.02). The role of rare earth metals in the enhancement of catalytic activity can be attributed to their high OSC, which assists in the possible accumulation of O2 and control oxygen concentration in the catalysis zone.190,206,207 Another important factor for the better catalytic activity lies in the ability of rare earth metals to decrease in the strength of Ni and Al2O3 in spinel NiAl2O4.207 This facilitates the reduction process of NiO and assisted in the release of Ni from spinel NiAl2O4 structure leading to the higher activity and stability for tri-reforming.

Majewski et al.208 investigated the application of novel core–shell catalyst (Ni@SiO2) in which SiO2 core was protected by Ni shell, which will limit the access to silica surface as previous studies reported that application of silica support for SRM exhibited serious issues. Tri-reforming reaction was investigated over core–shell catalyst by varying feed ratio (CH4:H2O = 1:0–3.0 and CH4:O2 = 1:0–0.5) and temperature (550–750 °C). The influence of temperature was significant in the enhancement of catalytic activity as increase of temperature from 550 to 750 °C leads to increase of methane (24% to 70%) and carbon dioxide (4% to 52%) conversion; however, syn-gas ratio was seen to be decreased from 3.7 to 2.6. The higher temperature favors the endothermic reforming reactions (SRM and DRM), however, the decrease of syn-gas ratio can be dedicated to the higher occurrence of RWGS reaction, which will utilize some of the H2 produced and produced more CO. Moreover, the rise of temperature has strong impact on the morphology of the catalyst as described in the Fig. 19 by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The spent catalyst for tri-reforming at 550 °C indicated the presence of whisker carbon or carbon nanotubes (Fig. 19a), however, there was no such significant amount of carbon nanotubes on the spent catalyst at 750 °C (Fig. 19b). This phenomenon also matches with the TPO results, which indicates the presence of higher coke deposition on spent catalyst at 550 °C (99 mg gcat−1) compared to spent catalyst at 750 °C (5 mg gcat−1). Moreover, the study indicates the influence of molar feed ratios; as the suitable molar ratio (CH4:CO2:H2O:O2:He = 1:0.5:0.5:0.1:0.4) not only produced higher methane (73%) and CO2 (55.6) conversion but also exhibited lower coke deposition (5 mg gcat−1). The higher CO2 conversion (91.1%) for the case without H2O addition can be dedicated to the enhanced CO2 adsorption on the active sites, as there will be no competition between H2O and CO2. However, the addition of H2O in the system leads to the decrease in CO2 conversion due to the competition for active sites.

In the above section, the detailed study of economic aspects, feasibility and influence of different types of catalysts and feeds gas ratios has been reported. However, the influence of reactor type which is an important aspect of any process was not discussed. A recent study investigated the tri-reforming process in a comparison study for FBR and FIBR.209 FIBR are considered to have good heat management ability, proper mixing of catalyst particles, lower pressure drop and diffusion limitation removal. The study leads to conclusion that the application of FIBR has strong influence over the enhancement of methane conversion and CO2 consumption by 1.2% and 6%, respectively compared to FBR. This enhancement in reaction efficiency was dedicated to the better temperature management, lower pressure drop and as well as decline in hot spot temperature in the catalytic bed.209 Moreover, a recent study reported the thermodynamic analysis of tri-reforming process at various reaction conditions such as temperature (200–1000 °C), pressure (1–20 atm) and inlet feed gas O2/CH4 (0–1.0), H2O/CH4 (0–3.0) and CO2/CH4 (0–3.0) mol ratios.210 The study revealed that this reaction is thermodynamically favorable at high temperature and low pressure to produce higher H2 yield and CO2 conversion. Furthermore, the study on the inlet gas mole ratios lead to conclusion that the high concentration of H2O, O2, CO2 produced lower H2 yield and CO2 conversion, whereas, low concentration of H2O, O2, CO2 resulted in the severe carbon formation. Therefore, to achieve higher H2 yield and CO2 conversion and to avoid carbon formation; the optimized feed ratio proposed in the tri-reforming process was such as: CH4/CO2/H2O/O2 = 1:0.291:0.576:0.088.210 The detailed reaction conditions and reactants conversion are listed in Table 3.
Tri-reforming reaction study indicates that this process is favored at high temperature and low pressure ranges. Moreover, various parameters such as: proper choice of modifier, support and active metal played an important role in enhancing catalytic activity. The interesting feature of tri-reforming process is the combination of endothermic and exothermic reactions and also the direct utilization of CO2 from industrial sources. This process has been studied extensively at the laboratory scale for the production of methanol and DME; and in the recent years the production of DME at pilot plant scale has been demonstrated in Korea.211 However, in the best of our knowledge there is no industrial scale operation on tri-reforming process for methanol synthesis. The detailed investigation on the process economics, feasibility, feed gas ratios and catalyst types indicated that tri-reforming is an interesting option for long term global carbon management and for the synthesis of methanol.
4. Future outlook and conclusions
The utilization of the greenhouse gas sources for methanol synthesis will be a tremendously important step for slowing down climate change and to decrease our reliance on fossil fuels. The utilization of COG for the syn-gas generation appears to be a suitable option; however, there was lack of studies on the application of novel catalysts to investigate the influence on catalytic activity and syn-gas ratio. The application of basic metal oxides (CaO, MgO) and the addition of metal oxides such as: ZrO2 and CeO2 as a promoter and support materials for Ni-based catalysts will be suited for this application due to higher OSC, thermal stability and higher carbon deposition resistance. The combination of two endothermic reactions (DRM + SRM) in the bi-reforming process reduced its attractiveness for industrial applications. The required methanol synthesis plant capacity plays a major role in the selection of reforming processes. For small-to-medium scale operations, SRM has been regarded a suitable option in the past years for industrial operation; however the higher energy requirements in this era of awareness regarding the efficient utilization of resources urges us to search for alternative processes. Therefore, detailed investigation on the different reforming processes (DRM + SRM, ATR, DRM + POX, bi-reforming, tri-reforming) with suitable feed sources (biogas, COG, flue gas) and their economic analysis leads to the conclusion that ATR and tri-reforming process seemed to be the promising processes. ATR process has been in operation on the industrial scale and is considered suitable for large scale syn-gas plant capacities; however, tri-reforming process besides its advantages of utilizing flue gases without CO2 separation is still in its infancy and till now not pursued on industrial scale probably due to the presence of comparably more mature technologies (ATR and SRM) with plenty of industrial experience. Therefore, further investigations on tri-reforming process needs to be focused on its suitability for the large scale plant capacities and also it demands a detailed economic analysis in the future by including the estimation of capital costs and equipment depreciation in the economic analysis to fully reveal the economic feasibility of tri-reforming of methane to produce methanol.188 It can be anticipated that further studies on tri-reforming process will highlight its economic benefits and the implementation of tri-reforming process on industrial scale will support our commitment towards the achievement of cleaner and sustainable environment. In the recent years, CO2 hydrogenation has been extensively studied for methanol synthesis utilizing both renewable and non-renewable energy sources and searching for efficient and economical CO2 capture technologies. In future, it will be interesting to perform a comparison study for methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation and tri-reforming process from the economical point of view and reduction in net CO2 emissions because the basic difference between these processes is the CO2 capture from flue gases in hydrogenation process or utilizing directly into the tri-reforming process. Moreover, the uncertain and continuous depleting resources of fossil fuels require aggressive efforts to pursue for alternative solutions to fulfill our energy demands as there is no single solution available to the facing global challenges. It can be anticipated that the further advancement in different aspects such as: reactor type, catalysts type, and utilization of renewable energy sources will bring significant progress in the abatement of major greenhouse gases (CH4 and CO2) and to produce clean liquid fuel (methanol) with minimal environmental damage.
