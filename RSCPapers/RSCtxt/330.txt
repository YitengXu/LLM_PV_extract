    First published on 15th June 2020AbstractThe past decade has witnessed tremendous advances in synthesis of metal halide perovskites and their use for a rich variety of optoelectronics applications. Metal halide perovskite has the general formula ABX3, where A is a monovalent cation (which can be either organic (e.g., CH3NH3+ (MA), CH(NH2)2+ (FA)) or inorganic (e.g., Cs+)), B is a divalent metal cation (usually Pb2+), and X is a halogen anion (Cl−, Br−, I−). Particularly, the photoluminescence (PL) properties of metal halide perovskites have garnered much attention due to the recent rapid development of perovskite nanocrystals. The introduction of capping ligands enables the synthesis of colloidal perovskite nanocrystals which offer new insight into dimension-dependent physical properties compared to their bulk counterparts. It is notable that doping and ion substitution represent effective strategies for tailoring the optoelectronic properties (e.g., absorption band gap, PL emission, and quantum yield (QY)) and stabilities of perovskite nanocrystals. The doping and ion substitution processes can be performed during or after the synthesis of colloidal nanocrystals by incorporating new A′, B′, or X′ site ions into the A, B, or X sites of ABX3 perovskites. Interestingly, both isovalent and heterovalent doping and ion substitution can be conducted on colloidal perovskite nanocrystals. In this review, the general background of perovskite nanocrystals synthesis is first introduced. The effects of A-site, B-site, and X-site ionic doping and substitution on the optoelectronic properties and stabilities of colloidal metal halide perovskite nanocrystals are then detailed. Finally, possible applications and future research directions of doped and ion-substituted colloidal perovskite nanocrystals are also discussed.

1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskites are materials with the general structure ABX3, where A is a monovalent cation (which can be either organic (e.g., CH3NH3+ (MA), CH(NH2)2+ (FA)) or inorganic (e.g., Cs+)), B is a divalent metal cation (usually Pb2+), and X is a halogen anion (Cl−, Br−, I−). The divalent metal B is surrounded by six halogen atoms forming a BX6 octahedral structure while the A cation is located in the cubo-octahedral cavity within the corner-shared BX6 octahedral framework forming a three-dimensional (3D) structure (Fig. 1). In recent years, metal halide perovskites have attracted great research interest due to their cost-effective solution processability and remarkable performance in optoelectronic applications. The utilization of capping ligands such as oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OLA) during colloidal synthesis allows for the creation of perovskite nanocrystals. Demonstrated morphologies of perovskite nanocrystals include nanocubes, nanowires, nanoplatelets, nanoparticles, etc.1–4 Perovskite nanocrystals possess a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio than their bulk counterparts.12 Additionally, nanocrystals may exhibit different optoelectronic responses than their bulk form due to quantum confinement and strong anisotropic effects.5,6 Perovskite nanocrystals have demonstrated a promising future in many optoelectronic applications and have been applied in photovoltaic cells,7–10 photodetectors,11–18 lasers,19–25 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),26–45 and many other applications.

The A cation is located in the cubo-octahedral cavity within the corner-shared BX6 octahedral framework, forming a three-dimensional (3D) structure. 
1.1. Colloidal perovskite nanocrystals
Although all-inorganic and organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have been synthesized and studied for several decades,46,47 their optoelectronic potential was first explored only a decade ago. In their seminal work, Kojima et al. incorporated CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) into a sensitized solar cell and obtained an energy conversion efficiency of ∼2.2%.48 Since then, the solar conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has improved more than 10 times to >25% and is comparable to Si-based solar cells.49 The tremendous photovoltaic efficiency of metal halide perovskites can be attributed to their unique optoelectronic properties: long carrier diffusion lengths,50,51 high charge carrier mobilities,52 long-range balanced electron and hole transport,53 low trap-state density,54 multiphoton high absorption coefficients,55–58 and direct and tunable band gaps.5 Colloidal MAPbBr3 nanocrystals were first synthesized in 2014 and have demonstrated excellent photoluminescence (PL) emission properties.59–61 Perovskite nanocrystals possess many unique advantages over legacy light emitters such as solution processability, bright luminescence (the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) can reach ∼100%),61,62 narrow emission bandwidth (the full width at half maximum (FWHM) can be as low as below 15 nm),5 and tunable emission spectra over the entire visible region (from roughly 400 nm all the way to around 750 nm).63 The applications of metal halide perovskite nanocrystals extend beyond those mentioned above into many other uses such as: (1) serving as an intermediate layer to tune band gap alignment in photovoltaic cells,64,65 (2) filling pinholes and cracks in perovskite film photodetectors through recyclable dissolution–recrystallization (RDR),66 (3) boosting power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells by down-converting UV to harvestable visible light,67 (4) tailoring lighting displays to the desired color temperature by down-converting a blue chip LED source,68–71 (5) probing for 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP, picric acid), tetraoctylammonium halide salts (TOAX), or gaseous HCl by monitoring PL or colorimetric responses,72–74 (6) serving as X-ray photon detection scintillators by converting X-ray irradiation and radioluminescence into visible wavelengths,75 (7) generating hydrogen (H2) via photocatalytic hydrohalic acid (HX) splitting,76 (8) reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) via photocatalysis with or without the assistance of another carrier transportation material for electron-extraction,77–83 (9) preventing fraud by serving as fluorescent inks for anti-counterfeit or encryption printing purposes,84–86 (10) serving as luminescence probes for bioimaging applications,87–94 and many others.
1.2. Syntheses and morphologies
Colloidal metal halide perovskite nanocrystals can be synthesized using several different methods. The hot injection method, adapted from the method commonly used in the synthesis of traditional II–VI, III–V, and IV–VI semiconductor quantum dots, is the first method introduced to synthesize perovskite nanocrystals which is performed at an elevated temperature.95 Low temperature (or room temperature) synthesis methods include the ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) method and supersaturated recrystallization (SR) method.95 Hot-injection, LARP, and SR methods can all be used to synthesize both all-inorganic and organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite nanocrystals.59–61 Hot-injection method usually involves the use of high-boiling point non-coordinating solvent such as octadecene (ODE), while low temperature synthesis methods usually employ both a polar solvent (with high solubility for ionic perovskite precursors, e.g., N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) and non-polar solvent (with poor solubility for ionic perovskite precursors, e.g., toluene or hexane).96 In both high and low temperature methods capping ligands are needed to stabilize the reaction, with the acid–base pair of oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OLA) being among the most commonly used. Polymer micelles,90,97,98 surfactant emulsions,30 star-like copolymers,99,100 and microporous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)81,101,102 are examples of some additional capping ligands or templates that have been used for colloidal metal halide perovskite nanocrystal synthesis. Alternative wet-synthesis processes for perovskite nanocrystal synthesis include microwave irradiation,103–105 ultrasonication,17,45,106–112 dilution,113 and solvothermal synthesis.114
The nucleation and growth mechanisms of MAPbX3 nanocrystals created using the LARP method have been proposed,115 and the formation mechanisms of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals have been studied via a slowed-down microwave-assisted synthesis.103 Systematic study of formation mechanisms of mixed halide perovskites has been achieved by a droplet-based microfluidic platform.116 Gram-scale mass production of CsPbX3 nanocrystals has been achieved by both a microwave irradiation process,104 and by mixing Cs–oleate and Pb–oleate with tetraoctylammonium halide in toluene at room temperature.117 In addition to the wet-synthesis processes mentioned above, some dry mechanosynthesis processes such as grinding or milling have been used to synthesize perovskite nanocrystals. After physically mixing precursors by grinding or milling, they can be dissolved in solvent with ligands to form colloidal nanocrystals, or in some cases the mixture of precursors will become bulk crystals in powder form without the addition of solvent or capping ligands. Luminescent MAPbX3,108,118 MASnBr3,119 CsPbX3,120,121 Mn-doped CsPbX3,122 and Cs(AgBi)x/2Pb1−xBr3123 colloidal nanocrystals or powders have been made using grinding or milling methods.
The diverse dimensionality of perovskites adds an additional degree of freedom for tuning material properties. A multitude of diverse morphologies of metal halide perovskite nanocrystals can be created by fine tuning the synthesis conditions such as: temperature, reaction time, amount or type of the capping ligands, and injection speed of the precursors. Some examples for the various morphologies of the colloidal metal halide perovskite nanocrystals that have been successfully synthesized are 3D nanocubes,1,2,110,114,124 two-dimensional (2D) nanoplates,1–4,27,104,110,124–127 2D nanosheets,3,128,129 one-dimensional (1D) nanowires,1,4,104,110,111,114,130–134 1D nanorods,1,2,104,135 and zero-dimensional (0D) nanodots.1–4,96,110,136,137 Hexagonal or irregular shape nanocrystals have also been achieved,104,138 but it is possible that these hexagonal or irregular shape nanocrystals are a lead-poor phase (e.g., Cs4PbBr6 phase compared to CsPbBr3 phase), because the ratio of acid–base ligand pair will affect the solubility of lead halide salts.109,139
1.3. Defect tolerance
Unlike conventional II–VI, III–V, and IV–VI semiconductor quantum dots, lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are defect-tolerant and do not suffer similar quenched emission from surface defect states. The defect tolerance in both CsPbX3 and MAPbX3 nanocrystals can be attributed to the unique electronic band structure configuration of the bonding–antibonding interaction within their conduction bands and valence bands.140,141 In conventional semiconductors, the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) are predominantly composed of bonding (σ) and antibonding (σ*) orbitals, respectively. In lead halide perovskites, the valence band maximum (VBM) is antibonding (σ*) in nature and conduction band minimum (CBM) is stabilized by the spin–orbit splitting of Pb(6p) states (Fig. 2).142 Schematics of the two limiting cases of semiconductor band structure are in Fig. 2a: (left) conventional defect-intolerant band structure, and (right) ideal hypothetical defect-tolerant band structure. Schematic of lead halide perovskite band structure is shown in Fig. 2b using APbI3 (A = Cs or MA) as an example: (1) the valence band maximum (VBM) is exhibiting antibonding characters originating from the hybridization of Pb(6s) and I(5p) orbitals, which meets the optimal bonding character of defect tolerance as depicted in Fig. 2a, while (2) the conduction band minimum (CBM) is mainly composed of antibonding orbitals contributed from Pb(6p) (rather than Pb(6p)–I(5p) interactions) and does not seem to meet the optimal bonding character of defect-tolerant case. Strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects result in energy level splitting, which leads to a beneficial band broadening that shifts the bottom of the conduction band below the Pb(6p) atomic orbital and increases the chance that defects form as intra-conduction band states.143 Density functional theory (DFT) calculation has demonstrated that both bulk or surface perovskites show no in-gap defect states between the VBM and CBM,144 and that removing some of the surface atoms and/or capping molecules (creating dangling bonds) does not introduce localized trap states within the band gap.145 Defects such as vacancies, interstitial atoms, and surface states will not likely form intra-gap states but rather appear as resonances inside shallow transition levels. Because of this, the surface passivation commonly used in conventional quantum dot synthesis is not strictly required in lead halide perovskites.143 Because of their defect-tolerant nature, high PLQY lead halide perovskite nanocrystals do not require the same high purity, high temperature, or equipment-intensive vacuum synthesis as conventional semiconductor materials, which make them more easily scalable for mass production.141 Exploration of other materials with similar defect tolerance electronic band structure is a promising direction, with I–III–VI compound semiconductors and Cu3N being prime examples.142 It is worth noting that A-site cations do not directly affect the band gap because they form bonding states deep in the VBM and do not hybridize with PbI6 octahedra near VBM or CBM.146 The A-site cations do, however, indirectly change the band gap because their size determines both the structural stability and the expansion or contraction of the perovskite lattice, both of which alter band structure.142

1.4. Tolerance factor and octahedral factor
Not all combinations of A1+, B2+, and X1− can form the complex ABX3 halide perovskite structure. Tolerance factor (t), a rule proposed by Goldschmidt in the early 1920s, is used to understand and quantify what combination of chemical species can form perovskite structure.147 (1)RA, RB and RX are the ionic radii for the ions in the A, B and X sites of ABX3 perovskites, respectively. A t value close to unity (t ≈ 1) indicates a perfect fit and thus successful perovskite formation. The tolerance factor (t) can be used to determine whether the A site cations can fit in the cavities within the BX6 octahedral framework. Differing from their oxide perovskite counterparts (A2+B4+O32−), metal halide perovskite (A1+B2+X31−) has a limited choice of cations because: (1) the relatively smaller negative charge of halides (1− vs. 2−) is only able to compensate A-site and B-site cations with lower oxidation states, and (2) the ionic radii of halides are larger than oxides, which requires larger B-site metal ions to maintain octahedral coordination geometry.148 For lead halide perovskites, the tolerance factor ranges from 0.81 < t < 1.11.149 If t lies outside this range, 3D perovskite structure will not be formed and instead polymorphs of corner-sharing BX6 octahedra with a lower dimensional connectivity such as 2D layers, 1D chains, or 0D BX6 octahedral clusters will appear.150–152 These lower-dimensional lead halide compounds usually possess much larger band gaps and are not suitable for photovoltaic applications.153 In addition to tolerance factor (t), the octahedral factor (μ) is also used to indicate perovskite stability, (2)where μ is defined as the ratio of the ionic radii of the species occupying the B-site to X-site. For lead halide perovskites, the range for the octahedral factor is 0.44 < μ < 0.90.149 Both the tolerance factor and the octahedral factor are necessary but not sufficient conditions for the formation of stable ABX3 3D perovskites.154
Selecting species that fit the criteria listed above for ABX3 perovskite can be challenging. For the A site, cesium (Cs+) is the only monovalent metal with a sufficiently large ionic size (RA of 1.88 Å) to sustain the lead halide perovskite structure, while Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ cations all result in a tolerance factor smaller than 0.8.155,156 Two other monovalent organic molecular cations are known to fit in the 3D PbX6 framework, and they are methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3+) and formamidinium (FA, CH(NH2)2+) with ionic radii (RA) of 2.17 Å and 2.53 Å, respectively.151,157 It appears that for organic cations, both the size and distribution of the net positive charge are important. This helps explain why MA and FA can stabilize 3D lead halide perovskite structures and other monovalent organic cations with similar size (see effective ionic radii (RA) in Table 1) cannot.148 A wider range of divalent metal cations are candidates for the B-site (such as alkaline metals, transition metals, and lanthanides), but the use of many of them leads to limited ability to form 3D perovskite structures or band gaps too large for photovoltaic applications.157 The most logical candidates to replace Pb2+ in the B site are the other group-14 elements, Ge2+ and Sn2+ (the effective radii (RB) for Ge2+, Sn2+, and Pb2+ are 0.73 Å, 1.15 Å, and 1.19 Å, respectively), because they have a similar electronic configuration to Pb2+. Unfortunately, Sn2+ and Ge2+ are not stable and oxidize to Sn4+ and Ge4+ easily.157,158 For X-site anions, the effective radii of halide anions (RX) are 1.81 Å, 1.96 Å, and 2.20 Å for chloride (Cl−), bromide (Br−), and iodide (I−), respectively.151

1.5. Challenges and overview
Different properties can be achieved by substituting ions in either the A-site, B-site, or X-site. Generally, A-site substitution can improve the overall stability by tuning the tolerance factor. B-site substitution can reduce the toxic Pb content and improve phase stability by altering the B–X bond length. X-site substitution can tune the band gap via changing the ratio of mixed-halide ions. It is worth noting that these simplified generalities do not fully capture all the effects that substituting ions in A-, B-, and X-sites can have on the final products. For example, substituting in any site of ABX3 metal halide perovskites could alter its band gap (Table 2), yet only X-site substitution shows a clear trend in band gap tailoring.

Initial studies suggest that metal halide perovskite nanocrystals carry a promising future in many applications, yet substantial obstacles such as lead toxicity, hysteresis, and long-term stability may prevent them from successful commercialization. Notably, composition engineering has shown to be an effective route to overcoming many of those issues. By doping and substituting different ions into perovskites, their overall performance can be markedly improved by optimizing band alignment and emission range,165 increasing stability, improving film morphology, enhancing charge carrier transport, minimizing hysteresis, and reducing toxic lead content.146 For example, fully or partially replacing methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3+) with formamidinium (FA, CH(NH2)2+) in MAPbI3 perovskite thin film solar cell devices results in a smaller band gap, longer exciton lifetime, superior thermal stability, and reduced hysteresis.166–168 Nonetheless, composition engineering has its own limitation as partially substituting MA with FA increases the crystallization temperature of MAPbI3 perovskite, leading to phase separation or unwanted non-perovskite yellow δ-phase.168,169 A few recent reviews have discussed the importance of composition engineering in metal halide perovskite nanocrystals.170–174 Yet, an in-depth summary of both theoretical background and experimental guidelines on doping and ion substitution for crafting perovskite nanocrystals with outstanding optoelectronic properties and stabilities is still lacking. In this context, mixed-cation or mixed-anion colloidal metal halide perovskite nanocrystals achieved via doping or ion substitution is the primary focus of this review. This review will discuss relevant topics in the following order: general background of perovskite nanocrystals (Chapter 1), recent studies on doping and ion substitution in A-site (Chapter 2), B-site (Chapter 3), and X-site (Chapter 4), and applications (Chapter 5) and outlook (Chapter 6) of mixed-cation/mixed-anion colloidal metal halide perovskite nanocrystals. It is notable that this review will concentrate primarily on ABX3 type 3D perovskites. Other perovskites such as A2B′B′′X6, A3B2X9, or Ruddlesden–Popper type low-dimensional perovskites will only be briefly discussed.175–183
2. A-site substitution
At room temperature, MAPbX3 and FAPbX3 usually exhibit cubic structure and CsPbX3 usually has orthorhombic structure. The difference in structure is due to the fact that the Cs+ ion is relatively smaller which leads to octahedral tilting/distortion and thus less symmetry leading to orthorhombic structure.150 Due to the relatively small A-site cation, all inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite nanocrystals have a relatively small tolerance factor (t) (Table 2). By changing the relatively small Cs+ ion to larger A-site cations, the tolerance factor can be raised closer to 1. If the substituted A-site cations are too large for the PbX6 octahedral framework, the Ruddlesden–Popper type layered perovskite structures may form.158,184 For traditional lead halide perovskite, FA is the relatively largest usable A-site cation and can achieve a tolerance factor (t) closer to 1 than MA and Cs cations. Compared to MAPbI3, FAPbI3 has shown superior solar cell performance due to red-shifted absorption (reduced band gap) and better charge transport. First-principles calculations demonstrate that the advantages of FA result from structure-induced enhancement of spin–orbit coupling (SOC).185 The size of cations is not the only factor that determines crystal structure, as demonstrated by the fact that MAPbI3 is tetragonal and FAPbI3 is trigonal/pseudocubic even though the size of MA (RA = 2.17 Å) and FA (RA = 2.53 Å) are not that different. This difference can be explained by the fact that FA is more likely to form hydrogen bonds than MA, thereby stabilizing the pseudocubic structure.185 The interaction between organic cations and the inorganic PbX6 octahedra matrix mainly takes place through weak electrostatic interactions, but by careful cation design, it is possible to enhance the stability of perovskite by triggering stronger electronic coupling and electrostatic interactions like hydrogen-bonding, halogen-bonding, and van der Waals interaction.186
FAPbX3 colloidal nanocrystals with emission spanning the whole visible range have been successfully synthesized using both hot-injection method187–189 and room temperature LARP method.190,191 Both hot-injection and room temperature synthesis methods can obtain FAPbBr3 colloidal nanocrystals with similar optical properties (i.e., emission peak at ∼530 nm, PLQY > 85%, and FWHM < 22 nm), but some mixed-halide FAPbX3 colloidal nanocrystals are not single phase. Phase segregation has been widely observed in mixed-halide perovskite systems including FAPbX3,188 MAPbX3,192 and CsPbX3.193,194 An automated droplet-based microfluidic platform was used to show that phase segregation occurred in FAPb(Cl/Br)3 nanocrystals when Cl:Br ≥ 0.4.188 Ion migration has been proposed as a cause of the hysteresis phenomena observed in perovskite photovoltaic cells.195,196 Two different mechanisms of PL intermittency, blinking (binary on–off switching) and flickering (gradual undulation) behaviors, have been identified in single FAPbBr3 nanocrystals.197 It was found that surface treatment with sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) enhanced PLQY and completely suppressed flickering, but had no effect on blinking behavior.197
2.1. FA–MA mixed-cation lead halide perovskite nanocrystals
FAPbX3 can be synthesized via cation exchange by replacing MA in MAPbX3 with FA. Post-synthetic cation exchange of MAPbX3 nanocrystals to FAPbX3 nanocrystals was achieved through a solid–liquid–solid cation exchange reaction by adding solid formamidine acetate (FA(Ac)) salts into a toluene solution of MAPbX3 nanocrystals.198 This cation exchange proceeds slowly due to the minimal solubility of FA(Ac) in toluene. FAPbX3 nanocrystals with emissions spanning from 395 nm to 700 nm can be achieved, depending on the halide ratio of the initial MAPbX3 nanocrystals. Both the absorption and emission spectral features of the perovskite nanocrystals red shifted after cation exchange. The PL peak of the initial MAPbBr3 nanocrystals was 515 nm and gradually shifted to 531 nm for the final FAPbBr3 nanocrystals. This red shift corresponds to an energy shift of ∼73 meV, which is comparable to the ∼80 meV difference in bulk band gaps of MAPbBr3 (Eg = 2.34 eV) and FAPbBr3 (Eg = 2.26 eV) (Fig. 3B).198 Interestingly the FWHM of the PL peak decreased from ∼26 nm (122 meV, initial MAPbBr3) to ∼20 nm (88 meV, final FAPbBr3), suggesting a narrower particle size/shape distribution of the final FAPbBr3 (Fig. 3C). The PLQY slightly decreased from 72% (initial MAPbBr3) to 69% (final FAPbBr3), which could be attributed to an increased number of trap states formed as a result of larger FA+ cations transporting inside the perovskite crystalline lattices.198 The evolution of PL lifetime decay during the FA+ cation exchange reaction were measured and an increase of the overall photo-excited carrier lifetime from 10.2 ns (initial MAPbBr3) to 35.9 ns (final FAPbBr3) was observed (Fig. 3D). Longer lifetimes were suggested to result from the relatively stronger interaction between the inorganic sublattice and FA+, which originates from FA+'s ability to form four short hydrogen bonds while MA+ can only form three.198,199 The crystal structure of the perovskite nanocrystals was monitored by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and was found to maintain a cubic crystal structure during the cation exchange process. The calculated lattice constant increased from 5.91 Å (initial MAPbBr3) to 6.01 Å (final FAPbBr3), which corresponds to a unit cell volume expansion of 5.2%, induced by the ionic radius difference between the MA+ and FA+ cations (the effective radii of MA+ and FA+ cations are 2.17 Å and 2.53 Å, respectively).198

Perovskite's instability in polar solvents proves to be a challenge for ion exchange preparation of FAPbI3 perovskite thin film solar cells from MAPbI3 crystals. Usually, the cation-exchange process would involve immersing an as-prepared MAPbI3 substrate in a FA+-containing alcohol solution, but the polar nature of alcohol would immediately destroy the existing MAPbI3.200 To overcome this dissolution issue, FAPbI3 thin film solar cell have been synthesized by converting MAPbI3 to FAPbI3 by exposing the MAPbI3 perovskite film to gaseous FA, allowing the process to occur without polar solvents.200 Although FAPbI3 demonstrates better thermal stability than MAPbI3, some structural instability challenges remain. It was found that the anisotropically strained (111) plane in the FAPbI3 lattice can promote the transformation of black perovskite phase FAPbI3 (α-phase) to yellow non-perovskite polymorph (δ-phase). Alloying smaller size methylammonium bromide (MABr) into FAPbI3 (forming FAPbI3–MABr) balances this lattice strain (which has shown to significantly enhance moisture stability) as well as contracts the overall lattice by increasing Coulombic interactions due to MABr's relatively smaller size (Fig. 4).201 FAxMA1−xPbBr3 mixed-cation colloidal nanocrystals have been synthesized using LARP method by mixing different ratios of FABr and MABr precursors together with PbBr2. Their optical properties have exhibited a continuous red-shift with increasing MA doping ratio,70 a result which contradicts the fact that FAPbBr3 (Eg = 2.26 eV) has a smaller band gap than that of MAPbBr3 (Eg = 2.34 eV).198 No clear explanation was given for this contradictory finding.

2.2. FA–Cs mixed-cation lead halide perovskite nanocrystals
In addition to MAPbX3 nanocrystals, cation exchange of FA ions has also been implemented on CsPbX3 nanocrystals. FAxCs1−xPbI3 nanocrystals can be obtained by mixing CsPbI3 nanocrystals with a FA–oleate precursor in toluene solution.202 The FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 nanocrystals show a red emission peak at 685 nm with PLQY exceeding 70% and much better stability than their parent CsPbI3 nanocrystals (PL stability improved from several days to a few months under storage at ambient conditions). The enhanced stability was proposed to be attributed to the lattice expansion caused by insertion of the larger FA+ (pure FAPbI3 nanocrystals retain their PL stability of near-IR region emission at ∼780 nm for a few months when stored in ambient conditions as well).202 The cation exchange mechanism of Cs+ and FA+ ions is reversible (one can obtain FAxCs1−xPbI3 nanocrystals by mixing FAPbI3 nanocrystals with Cs–oleate precursor as well), though there is an energetic cost of atomic rearrangement since FAPbI3 is a cubic phase and CsPbI3 is a γ-orthorhombic phase.202 Substituting I with Br is an effective method to tune the band gap of FAPbX3, but crystal will transform from a trigonal to a cubic phase at a critical I/Br ratio.203 To overcome this issue, Cs has been introduced to stabilize the structure and form FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I1−xBrx)3 mixed-cation lead mixed-halide perovskite.203 The introduction of relatively smaller Cs cations in the A-sites of FAPbX3 contracts the lattice, which reduces the cubo-octahedral volume, thereby inducing stronger interaction between the cations and halides, facilitating the formation of highly crystalline perovskite crystals at a low temperature.42 Colloidal FA1−xCsxPbBr3 mixed-cation perovskite nanocrystals with x = 0–0.6 have been synthesized to study the effect of Cs doping (Fig. 5a).42 XRD detected standard perovskite phase throughout the entire composition range for x = 0–0.6 (Fig. 5b), though a peak shift from 15.01° to 15.39° was observed, which indicates the shrinking of d-spacing due to incorporation of the smaller Cs cation. Cs doping has also shown to decrease lattice spacing by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). Fast Fourier transformation of HR-TEM images allow for the calculation of lattice fringe spacing (Fig. 5c), and the linear relationship between d-spacing and Cs content indicates this doping system follows Vegard's law. As Cs doping content increases, the absorption band is blue shifted from 525 nm (x = 0) to 503 nm (x = 0.6), (Fig. 5d bottom axis) corresponding to a band gap shift from 2.27 to 2.33 eV (Fig. 5d top axis). The PL peak is also blue shifted from 531 nm (x = 0) to 519 nm (x = 0.6), with narrow FWHMs of about 19–23 nm (Fig. 5e).42 Colloidal FA0.33Cs0.67PbBr3−xIx (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) mixed-cation lead mixed-halide perovskite nanocrystals with controllable morphologies such as nanowires and nanosheets over a wide range of halide compositions were achieved by tuning the ligand participating in the reaction (Fig. 6).204 Nanosheets and nanorods can be grown by altering the ratio between oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) during the reaction with the existence of bis(2-ethylhexyl)-amine (BEHA).204 NIR emissive CsxFA1−xPb(Br1−yIy)3 perovskite nanocrystals has been systematic studied by an automated droplet-based microfluidic platform.205

2.3. MA–Cs mixed-cation lead halide perovskite nanocrystals
Colloidal MA1−xCsxPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals were synthesized using the LARP technique. Briefly, MABr, CsBr, PbBr2, oleylamine, and oleic acid were dissolved in DMF and then added dropwise into toluene to form green colloidal nanocrystals. The as-prepared MA1−xCsxPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals are primarily cubic, with sizes varying from 8 nm to 12 nm (Fig. 5f). It was found that the absorption spectra blue-shifted from 515 nm to 505 nm when the Cs doping content increased from 0 to 0.4 (Fig. 5j) and the PL spectra also gradually blue-shifted from 539 nm to 533 nm as Cs doping levels increased (Fig. 5k). The crystallinity of MA1−xCsxPbBr3 perovskite was studied by XRD (Fig. 5g). It was found that increasing the Cs doping amount decreased the (100) peak intensity and increased the (110) peak intensity, which indicates that (110) is the preferred crystal growth direction. The (100) peak shifted from 14.91 degree to higher values, which indicates shrinkage of the crystal lattice (Fig. 5h). To further investigate the effect of Cs doping on the crystal structure, the lattice fringe was calculated from the fast Fourier transformation of the HR-TEM analyses (Fig. 5i). Increased Cs doping into MAPbBr3 lead to a reduction of lattice fringe distance due to the relatively smaller ionic radius of Cs atoms, which results in a reduction of the cubo-octahedral volume for the A-site cation. Smaller lattice spacing results in a larger band gap because a smaller lattice constant indicates stronger binding between the valence electrons and their parent atoms, therefore requiring more energy to promote from the valence band to conduction band.206 This trend is visible in Fig. 7, where, for every halide choice, nanocrystals with the smallest cation (Cs) emit the shortest wavelength, and nanocrystals with the largest cation (FA) emit the longest wavelength. Note that nanocrystals with MA always emit somewhere between those with Cs and FA, reflecting the fact that its size lies between those two extremes (ionic radii of Cs = 1.88 Å, MA = 2.17 Å, FA = 2.53 Å).17 This trend helps explain why the energy band gap increased (optical properties blue-shifted) with increasing Cs doping content in the FA1−xCsxPbBr3 (Fig. 5d and e)42 and MA1−xCsxPbBr3 (Fig. 5j and k)206 systems. However, individual cases with results contradictory to this trend were still observed in the literature. For example, colloidal MA1−xCsxPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals were synthesized using a novel anhydrous toluene assisted method in Dowtherm A. Peak emission wavelength from the nanocrystals was observed to red shift from 671 to 744 nm as the Cs doping increased from x = 0.1 to 0.5 (Table 3).207 The emission shift was attributed to displacement of the valence band edge due to the Cs-driven transition of nanocrystals from tetragonal to orthorhombic phase. Notably, the shift was not believed to result from any electronic effects from the Cs incorporation.207

2.4. Other mixed-cation lead halide perovskite nanocrystals
Potassium (K)-doped CsPbX3 nanocrystals have been produced via a reduced temperature recrystallization method using Cs2CO3, PbX2 and KX as precursors.208 Rubidium (Rb)-doped bulk RbxCs1−xPbCl3 and RbxCs1−xPbBr3 solid solutions have been achieved through grinding and heating,209 and colloidal RbxCs1−xPbCl3 and RbxCs1−xPbBr3 nanocrystals have been synthesized using a hot-injection method.219 Colloidal RbxCs1−xPbBr3 nanocrystals showed a green emission with maximum PLQY of ∼60% for Rb0.4Cs0.6PbBr3.210 Interestingly, another study demonstrated that emission could be tuned from 460 to 500 nm with PLQYs greater than 60% simply by varying the reaction temperatures.211 Thallium (Tl) has also been used to synthesize perovskite nanocrystals. Orthorhombic Tl3PbX5 spheroidal nanocrystals and perovskite TlPbI3 nanowires have been synthesized using a hot-injection method and displayed absorption in the UV range (281–440 nm) and had very weak wide emission across the visible spectrum (450–600 nm).212 It was suggested that thallium halide (TlBr, TlI) alone has a similar band structure to perovskite, and possesses strong spin–orbit coupling effects and the ability to form photoluminescent colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals.213
3. B-site substitution
It was suggested that the formation energy of the B-site is relatively larger than that of the A-site and X-site, which makes partial substitution of the B-site cation more difficult than the other ions in ABX3 perovskites.214 The main motivation for B-site substitution is to (1) reduce the toxic lead content, and (2) stabilize the perovskite phase. (1) Lead (Pb), a commonly used B-site species, is a toxic element with restricted use in many countries (including the entire European Union).215 Identifying a safer, lead-free perovskite with performance equal to that of lead halide perovskite is currently one of the biggest challenges in the field. Isovalent substitution of Pb2+ with other divalent cations in the same group of the periodic table (i.e. Ge2+, Sn2+), is the most intuitive strategy and has been realized by many research groups.216–219 Unfortunately, Sn2+ is not stable and easily oxidizes to Sn4+. This oxidation problem is even more pronounced for Ge2+ owing to its 4s2 electrons, which possess even lower binding energy.157,158 Some also argue that the stereoactive lone pair on the Ge2+ center may result in highly distorted GeI6 octahedra with three short and three long Ge–I bonds (quasi-3-D hexagonal structure).160,220 (2) Due to the size difference between Br− and I− ions, the tolerance factor for lead iodide perovskite is smaller (less stable) than that of the lead bromide perovskite (Table 2). The longer B–X bond length in the [PbI6]4− octahedra allows it to rotate and tilt more compared to that of the [PbBr6]4− octahedra. Partial substitution of Pb2+ with a smaller B-site cation can reduce the B–X bond length and stabilize the lead iodide perovskite by reducing the extent of octahedral rotation or distortion, thereby leading to larger tolerance factor (improved phase stability) and larger formation energy (improved thermal stability).214 Despite improved stability, devices made from perovskite with partial or complete substitution of Pb2+ often show less impressive optoelectronic properties than those containing Pb. This degradation of optoelectronic properties is because, as mentioned earlier, the 6s and 6p orbitals of Pb2+ determine the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of lead halide perovskites and substituting Pb2+ with other metal ions potentially introduces new defect states between VBM and CBM, destroying the defect tolerant nature of the lead halide perovskites. As a consequence, care must be taken when choosing B-site cations for doping or alloying to retain the impressive optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskites.214,221
Most effort in finding B-site replacements has focused on alternative isovalent cations that do not oxidize easily, are less toxic, and are smaller than Pb2+ ions. The partial replacement of Pb2+ with other divalent metal species (e.g., Co2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Sn2+, Sr2+, and Zn2+) for improving the phase stability or band energy alignment in lead iodide perovskite solar cells have been systematically studied.214,222 Besides isovalent substitution, aliovalent (heterovalent) substitution is also an alternative direction for B-site substitution. One can form a so-called “double perovskite” (A2B′B′′X6) structure by replacing two B-site divalent Pb ions with two heterovalent ions (2B → B′ + B′′), consisting of one with a higher and one with a lower oxidation state (i.e., one trivalent ion (M3+) and one monovalent ion (M+) or a quadrivalent ion (M4+) and a vacancy (V0+) forming A2MX6 structure). The most intuitive thought would be to substitute Pb2+ with Bi3+ and Tl1+, two elements directly adjacent to Pb in the periodic table (i.e., with same number of atomic orbitals). The lower binding energy of Bi 6p orbitals is likely to reduce the electronic band gap and the combination of trivalent and monovalent ions would cause fluctuations in electrostatic potential.158 One advantage of this approach is that one can tune the carrier concentrations of perovskite by controlling the substitution ratio between the trivalent and monovalent ions making it into either n-type (by excess Bi) or p-type (by excess Tl).158 Because this review mainly focuses on ABX3 type perovskites, double perovskites or other heterovalent doping perovskites will only be lightly discussed.
3.1. Sn-Based (divalent or quadrivalent substitution) perovskite nanocrystals
Sn is the most obvious substitute for Pb because they are in the same group. By introducing some SnBr2 to partially replace PbBr2 during hot-injection synthesis, Sn(II)-doped CsPbBr3 (CsPb1−xSnxBr3) nanocrystals have been synthesized.223 Increasing the Sn content gradually blue-shifted the absorption edges from 520 nm (x = 0) to 496 nm (x = 0.7) and blue-shifted the PL peak positions with decreased PLQY from 71% (x = 0) to 37% (x = 0.7) (Fig. 8a and b). The blue-shifted band gaps can possibly be attributed to lattice spacing shrinkage due to the smaller ionic radius of Sn cation (1.45 Å) compared to Pb cation (1.80 Å).223 According to the empirical Vegard's law,224 the band gap of a semiconductor is approximately a linear function of its lattice parameter and composition. Another group also demonstrated the substitution of Sn by partially replacing PbBr2 with SnBr2 during hot-injection synthesis, yet by using more oleic acid and oleylamine, they achieved a higher PLQY of 73.4%.225 In their study they found that reaction time, temperature, and the precursor ratio of Pb:Sn all play an important role in the final product, and that both cubic CsPbBr3 and tetragonal Cs4PbBr6 may form, depending on the growth conditions. A blue shift in the optical response was also observed when changing the precursor ratio of Pb:Sn from 1:1, 1:2.5 to 1:5.225 Similarly, CsPb1−xSnxBr3 nanocrystals have been synthesized by LARP method (Fig. 9).226 PL intensity was observed to drastically improve at x = 0.1, indicating that some Sn doping can promote radiative exciton recombination (Fig. 9b). However, PL intensity was found to decrease when x > 0.1, suggesting that significant Sn doping generated numerous defect states with oxidation. The lack of a significant shift in the absorption peak positions signifies that the band gaps of doped nanocrystals were similar to that of pristine nanocrystals, which are defined by the Pb(6s)–Br(4p) hybridized orbitals and the Pb(6p) orbitals (Fig. 9c). However, their PL peak positions were seen to also slightly blue-shifted, consistent with the results noted above. The XRD results suggested that the cubic structure of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals was well maintained upon Sn doping (Fig. 9d), but some Cs2SnBr6 impurity peaks (assigned by red triangles) were observed as Sn content increased. The morphology of nanocrystals became more irregular as the Sn concentration increased (Fig. 9e–j). Notably, room-temperature synthesis of CsSnBr3 nanocrystals has not yet been reported due to their instability and extremely low PL, thus the highest x value can only be 0.9 instead of 1.226 CsPb1−xSnxBr3 nanocrystals obtained by postsynthetic cation exchange using SnBr2 toluene solution also showed a trend of blue-shifting up to a critical SnBr2 concentration.227 Doping during hot-injection synthesis is mainly a thermodynamically controlled process, and the room temperature postsynthetic ion exchange reaction is mainly a kinetically controlled process. Due to the rigid nature of the Pb cationic octahedral sublattice, postsynthetic cation exchange of Pb takes much longer than halide exchange.228,229 It was found to be easier to substitute Pb ions while the halide ions were being substituted simultaneously. Pb to Sn ion exchange of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals was attempted using both SnI2 and SnBr2, and after 10 min of stirring only the sample containing SnI2 successfully exchanged ions.228 This suggested that the anion exchange reaction between the I/Br anions broke the Pb–Br bonding in the octahedral structure and provided a driving force for the cation exchange between Sn/Pb to happen. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that the Sn-exchanged perovskites displayed a lower binding energy shift of the Pb(4f) spectrum, which demonstrates an increase in the number of Pb–oleate (Pb–OA) (corresponding to lower band energy regions) complexes and a decrease in the number of Pb–Br (corresponding to higher band energy regions) species.228 This anion-driven cation exchange process in the perovskite systems has also been called halide exchange-driven cation exchange (HEDCE).229 Interestingly blue-shifted optical responses were observed in most Sn-doped colloidal nanocrystal cases,223,225–227,230 and red-shifted optical responses were observed in most Sn-doped thin film solar cell cases including: CsPb1−xSnxX3231 and MAPb1−xSnxX3216,219 systems. Some even observed that the band gaps of MAPb1−xSnxX3 perovskites did not fall in between their parent perovskites (MAPbX3 and MASnX3) but that they are smaller than both of them.217 A clear explanation of the contradictory optical responses in colloidal nanocrystal systems and thin film solar cell systems was not yet given in the literature. It is possible, however, that this contradiction is related to the halide content in the perovskite systems, noting that most studied thin film perovskite solar cells contain iodide ions and most studied colloidal nanocrystals perovskites contain bromide ions. In colloidal nanocrystal study related to iodide containing perovskites (CsSn1−xPbxI3), red-shifted optical responses were observed (Fig. 8c and d), which is consistent with those trends found in the thin film solar cell systems.10 Similarly, MASnI3 nanocrystals demonstrate red-shifted optical responses compared to MAPbI3.232 One possible explanation for the counterintuitive blue-shifted optical properties observed in the CsPb1−xSnxBr3 nanocrystal systems is that the absorption and PL properties for bromide containing perovskite nanocrystals are solely determined by the PbBr6 octahedra and would shift to higher energies with stronger interactions.227 SnCl2 has been used as a co-precursor to dope CsPbI3 nanocrystals in conventional hot injection method. Sn2+ can partially replace Pb2+, causing a slight lattice contraction and thus improving the perovskite stability. Cl− has been found to passivate the surface defects of CsPbI3 nanocrystals, thereby enhancing the PLQY, prolonging the emission lifetime, and improving the stability. The blue-shifted PL observed in this case is attributed to the lattice contraction due to the introduction of Sn.233

CsSnX3 perovskite nanocrystals have been synthesized via hot-injection method with the assistance of trioctylphosphine (TOP) (Fig. 10a–c), but the resulting CsSnBr3 nanocubes have a relatively low PLQY of 0.14%.234 Interestingly, unlike the above mentioned CsPb1−xSnxBr3 nanocrystals which blue-shifted upon doping of Sn, the optical properties of CsSnX3 nanocrystals are red-shifted when compared with CsPbX3, even in the bromide system. The absorption and emission wavelength of CsSnX3 nanocrystals can be tuned from visible to near-infrared (NIR) (roughly from 500 to 900 nm, see Fig. 10b), while the absorption and emission wavelength of CsPbX3 nanocrystals can only be tuned within the visible range (roughly from 400 nm to 700 nm).234 It was proposed that the band gaps of Sn-containing perovskite nanocrystals are relatively red-shifted (compared with their Pb-based counterparts) because Sn ions have a higher Pauling electronegativity (1.96) than Pb ions (1.87), which leads to a smaller separation between the X(5p) states in the valence band and the Sn(5p) states in the conduction band.151 Contrary to this trend, Ge-based perovskites (with high electronegativity of 2.01) like CsGeX3 do not have smaller band gaps than CsSnX3. The X(5p) and Ge(4p) do not yield band gaps smaller than their Sn counterparts (Table 2) because the smaller Ge2+ cation results in a substantially different quasi-3D hexagonal structure.151 Similarly, the reported band gap values for MAGeX3 are larger than that of MASnX3 analogs (Table 2) due to its substantially different quasi-3D hexagonal structure resulting from a second-order Jahn–Teller (SOJT) effect.151 CsSnX3 perovskite quantum rods with a narrow emission range (from 625 to 709 nm, Fig. 10d–f) have been synthesized using a solvothermal method with the assistance of trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and diethylenetriamine (DETA) in a sealed Teflon-lined autoclave. Three unique crystal structures were obtained (Fig. 10e), each corresponding to a different halide (monoclinic for CsSnCl3, cubic for CsSnBr3, and orthorhombic for CsSnI3).235 Besides the nanocubes and quantum rods mentioned above, hollow CsSnBr3 perovskite cubic nanocages have been achieved by hot-injection method using stannus 2-ethylhexanoate (a branched n-alkanoates ligand) as the tin(II) source and MgBr2 as the bromine source (Fig. 11).236 The stability of the CsSnBr3 nanocages can be significantly improved with the surface treatments of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) where PFOA serves as a strong electron-withdrawing group to stabilize Sn2+ species.236

Because Sn(II) easily oxidizes to Sn(IV) (which causes the instability of CsSnX3), direct synthesis of nanocrystals using Sn(IV), instead of ion exchanging with Sn(II), will lead to more stable Sn-based perovskite. CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskite nanocrystals with Sn(IV) substitution were achieved by hot-injection method.230 The PLQY increased from 45% to 83% when the relative amount of Sn increased from x = 0 to x = 0.33 probably due to the suppression of nonradiative Auger recombination trions (charged excitons). Further incorporation of Sn will lead to a decrease in PLQY, which is likely due to the formation of the Cs2SnBr6 phase. It is worth noting, however, that the study was conducted using Sn(II) (SnBr2) instead of Sn(IV), so their statement of Sn(IV) substitution is questionable.230 Cs2SnI6 nanocrystals with morphologies of spherical quantum dots, nanorods, nanowires, nanobelts, and nanoplatelets have been achieved by using a tetravalent tin ion (Sn4+) instead of divalent tin ion (Sn2+) as a Pb2+ replacement (Fig. 12).237 Ligand-free Cs2SnI6 perovskite nanocrystals have also been achieved and demonstrated colloidal stability for 30 min to 12 hours, depending on the particle size.238 Cs2SnI6 is a double perovskite structure, which can be visualized by removing half of the B-site cations in ABX3 perovskite. Orange emitting 2D Ruddlesden–Popper type (C18H35NH3)2SnBr4 ((OAm)2SnBr4) perovskite nanocrystals have also been achieved with high PLQY of 88%.239 CsSnI3 also shows phase instability similar to that of CsPbI3: under ambient conditions, the black phase easily transforms to yellow phase.240 It has been demonstrated that alloyed CsSn1−xPbxI3 nanocrystals are stable in ambient air for up to a few months, which is far superior to both of its parent CsSnI3 and CsPbI3 nanocrystals, which are both only air stable for a few minutes.10 Notably, monovalent, divalent and trivalent cations such as Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Sn2+, Sr2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Mg2+, Bi3+, In3+, Mn3+, and Sb3+ have been doped into CsSn1−xPbxI3 nanocrystals to improve their PLQY. Interestingly, only monovalent Na+ doping displayed a significant PLQY enhancement from ∼0.3% to ∼28%, while Zn2+ and Cd2+ doping only improved the PLQY from ∼0.3% to ∼8%. Moreover, Na+ doping can enhance the single-color near-band-edge emission, yet the PL spectra of Zn- and Cd-doped CsSn1−xPbxI3 nanocrystals exhibited a wide emission plateau extending from 700 to 900 nm. On the basis of these observations, it was suggested that the formation of a stronger chemical interaction between I− and Sn2+ ions upon Na+ doping could potentially assist the stabilization of Sn2+ and suppress the formation of I vacancy defects, thereby resulting in PL enhancement.241 Incorporation of fluorine (via addition of SnF2 during fabrication) resulted in significant improvements in both the stability and performance of FASnI3 and CsSnI3 thin film solar cells and CsSnI3 near-infrared lasing. The increased performance can probably be attributed to the suppression of both trap states (Sn vacancies/free carrier density) and Sn2+ oxidation, both of which can be explained by the fact that the F− is a strong electron-withdrawing group that has a stronger interaction with Sn2+ than other halides.242–247 Further study is needed to determine if the increased stability from incorporation of SnF2 extends into CsSnI3, MASnI3, and FASnI3 nanocrystals.240 CsSn1−xPbxI3 powders with different phases have been prepared via self-organizing processes in aqueous solutions followed by annealing under nitrogen or air for different temperatures and times.248 It is interesting to see that most studies in tin(II)-based perovskite nanocrystals focus on all-inorganic CsSnX3 nanocrystals, although an early work does document solid state synthesis of CH3NH3SnBr3 powders.119

It is worth noting that though scientists have intensively studied using Sn2+ as a non-toxic substitute for Pb2+ in lead halide perovskite systems, one recent study stated that health effects from SnI2 are more harmful than potential lead poisoning induced by PbI2.249 The synthesis of Sn-based perovskite nanocrystals also usually requires the use of toxic phosphines (TOP or TOPO) as coordinating solvent, which further calls into question whether Sb truly is a safe alternative to Pb.228,230,234,235
3.2. Mn-Based (divalent substitution) perovskite nanocrystals
Mn-Doping is another widely studied strategy to replace Pb in perovskite nanocrystals.250 Due to the rigid nature of the Pb cationic sublattice in lead halide perovskite nanocrystals, halide exchange-driven cation exchange (HEDCE previously mentioned) is required to dope Mn.229 By adding MnCl2 as a doping agent into previously-synthesized CsPbBr3, Pb cations can be partially exchanged by Mn ions and CsPb1−xMnx(Cl/Br)3 can be obtained. The resulting CsPb1−xMnx(Cl/Br)3 is dual-emitting, with two PL peaks. The HEDCE strategy demonstrates that postsynthetic partial cationic replacement is more likely to occur when the rigid halide octahedron structure is opened due to halide exchange. It was found that only MnCl2 molecules (rather than mixture of Mn and Cl ions) facilitate successful partial cation exchange. The partial cation exchange reaction occurs over an extended time span, and though the final product possesses only two PL peaks, up to three emission peaks appear during the exchange process.229Fig. 13a illustrates the temporal evolution of PL spectra of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals after adding the MnCl2 precursor. The original emission peak of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals was at around 520 nm which showed green color under the irradiation of a 365 nm UV lamp (the first digital photograph of “0 min” in the upper panel of Fig. 13a). After 12 min of reaction, a peak at 438 nm appeared and the peak intensity of 520 nm decreased. The peak at 438 nm is an indication of the fast halide exchange, resulting in the formation of CsPb(Cl/Br)3 nanocrystals. After 43 min of reaction, the peak intensities at 438 nm and 520 nm keep increasing and decreasing, respectively, and another shoulder peak at 572 nm becomes visible (see blowup spectra from the inset). The peak at 572 nm indicates Mn2+ ligand-field transition emission from 4T1 to 6A1.229 The notation 4T1 → 6A1 refers to a transition between spin–orbit coupled energy levels of Mn2+ originated from the Tanabe–Sugano diagram.251 It took almost 40 h for completely exchange of all the initial CsPbBr3 nanocrystals into CsPb1−xMnx(Cl/Br)3 nanocrystals, which is indicated by the complete disappearance of the peak at 520 nm. The long reaction time is due to the difficult diffusion of large sized MnCl2 molecules into the nanocrystal lattice at room temperature (20 °C). Mild heating (50 °C) can dramatically shorten the reaction time from 40 h to 2 h due to accelerated molecular diffusion.229 Because of the slow diffusion of MnCl2 into the center of the nanocrystals, it was proposed that the three intermediate emission peaks are from mid-states of CsPbBr3/CsPb1−xMnx(Cl/Br)3 core/shell structures. With prolonged reaction time (allowing for diffusion), the domain of CsPbBr3 core will gradually decrease and the PL peak of CsPbBr3 (at 520 nm) will eventually disappear. For HEDCE to occur, the halide exchange and cation exchange between MnCl2 molecules and CsPbBr3 nanocrystals must proceed at the same time and same lattice site. It is for this reason that using separate Mn2+ and Cl− ions from different sources do not lead to Mn doping. The same HEDCE strategy can be repeated in different metal systems, like forming Sn-doped perovskite using SnCl2.229 The final dual-emitting CsPb1−xMnx(Cl/Br)3 nanocrystals have the potential to be used in temperature sensing applications due to temperature-dependent intensity of the two PL peaks. Fig. 13b reveals that the intrinsic emission peak of CsPb(Cl/Br)3 perovskite at 438 nm gradually decreases when the temperature is increased from 5 °C to 50 °C, which is due to thermally activated trapping of charge carriers. The slight red-shift in PL peak position was due to thermal expansion of the crystalline lattice.229 The emission peak of Mn at 572 nm was enhanced when the temperature increased, which can be attributed to elevated temperature-promoted exciton-to-Mn energy transfer rates, induced by the increased spectral overlap between perovskite donor and Mn acceptor. The slight blue-shift in peak position can be attributed to thermal expansion of the crystalline lattice which changed the strength of the ligand field on Mn ions. The temperature-dependent exciton-to-Mn energy transfer in CsPb1−xMnx(Cl/Br)3 nanocrystals was found to exhibit linear ratiometric emission between the intrinsic perovskite (emission at ∼438 nm) and Mn (emission at ∼572 nm) (the inset of Fig. 13b) and can be used for temperature sensing.229 A similar temperature-dependent PL study has also revealed the coupling between excitons and the d electrons of the dopants, and it was found that the exciton PL possesses biexponential kinetics where the short-lived emission is ascribed to the surface trapping state recombination while the long-lived component is due to the band-edge excitonic recombination.252 CsPbxMn1−x(Cl/Br)3 nanocrystals can also be achieved by mixing CsPbBr3 and CsPbxMn1−xCl3 nanocrystals together and stirred for 1 h to complete the simultaneous Mn2+ cation and Cl− anion exchanges, and the absorption and band edge emission of the as-prepared nanocrystals can be elaborately tuned from 402 nm to 514 nm while the real Pb and Mn contents can be analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) analysis.253 The cation exchange process between Pb2+ and Mn2+ ions has been proven to be a reversible/interchangeable process that one can obtain CsPb1−xMnxCl3 nanocrystals by either adding MnCl2 precursors into CsPbCl3 nanocrystal solution or by introducing PbCl2 precursors into CsMnCl3 nanocrystal solution.254 Similar to the HEDCE method, Mn doping can also occur through cation exchange driven by the photoinduced halide exchange in dihalomethane (CH2X2, X = Cl, Br) solvent.255 Mn2+ post-synthetic ion exchange can also be done via a quasi-solid–solid cation exchange reaction. By adding solid MnCl2·4H2O precursors to dried CsPbCl3 nanocrystals in the presence of ligands and allowing for a 15 hour reaction, Mn2+ heterogenous surface doping of the CsPbCl3 nanocrystals, followed by inward dopant diffusion, has been confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and optical spectroscopies. It was found that the presence of excess oleylamine ligands is able to activate the Mn2+-precursor and plays an important role in this quasi-solid–solid cation exchange reaction.256

Direct replacement of Pb with Mn during colloidal synthesis is easier than using above mentioned post-synthetic processes. It has been demonstrated that by using a phosphine-free hot-injection preparation method, the Mn substitution ratio can reach 46% (CsPb0.54Mn0.46Cl3).257 The energy transfer of photoinduced excitons from the CsPbCl3 host to the doped Mn greatly enhanced the PLQY of the CsPbCl3 nanocrystals. In the temperature-dependent dual emission study, they decreased the temperature from 298 K to 77 K (from 25 °C to −196 °C) and found that the intensity of the 390 nm emission peak greatly increased, with no significant shift in peak position (Fig. 13d). The intensity of the 580 nm emission peak slightly decreased and the peak position red-shifted to longer wavelengths. The dual PL emission from the Mn-doped CsPbCl3 can be explained by this model (Fig. 13c): CsPbCl3 host absorbs energy from the 365 nm excitation source and emits light at 390 nm via radiative recombination of the excitons. Electron or hole traps lead to nonradiative relaxation (energy loss) with low PLQY. The Mn substitution generates new states that allow exciton-to-MnII energy transfer from the CsPbCl3 host to the doped MnII ions. Excitons with sufficient thermal activation energy are allowed to transfer from one excited state to the other via intersystem crossing (ISC) (4T1–6A1 transition, d–d transition of MnII ions).257 New radiative recombination pathways of exciton-to-MnII energy transfer result in a longer fluorescent lifetime and emission of light at 580 nm with enhanced PLQY. The PL intensity of CsPbCl3 host is enhanced with decreased temperature due to the restriction of nonradiative relaxation processes, and the PL intensity of the MnII ion is reduced because fewer electrons have sufficient thermal energy to undergo the ISC process. The decreased temperature slightly reduced the energy level of the 4T1–6A1 transition and therefore the emission wavelength of MnII slightly red-shifts. It was found that a MnII doping ratio of 27% (CsPb0.73Mn0.27Cl3) obtains the highest PLQY of 54% (Table 4).257 It has also been found that Mn doping cannot occur when Mn-carboxylates such as manganese(II) acetate (Mn(Ac)2), manganese(II) acetylacetonate (Mn(Acac)2), and manganese–oleate (Mn(oleate)2) are used as Mn precursors, suggesting that pre-existing Mn–Cl bonds are beneficial for incorporating Mn into the lattice, similar to the prerequisite of HEDCE process mentioned above.258 Although one can synthesize Mn-doped CsPbCl3 by mixing PbCl2 and MnCl2 during synthesis, the same approach was not successful for PbBr2/MnBr2 or PbI2/MnI2 systems. This is probably due to the differences in their bond strengths. The bond dissociation energy of Mn–Cl (338 kJ mol−1) is only 12% higher than that of Pb–Cl (301 kJ mol−1), while the bond dissociation energy of Mn–Br (314 kJ mol−1) is 26% stronger than that of Pb–Br (249 kJ mol−1) and Mn–I bond (282 kJ mol−1) is 46% stronger than Pb–I bond (194 kJ mol−1).258 It was suggested that the similar bond energy of PbCl2 and MnCl2 favors mixing of these isovalent ions within the lattice, which leads to successfully doped perovskite nanocrystals. In the other two cases, the large disparity in bond energies may favor extended domains of MnX2 instead of the dispersion of Mn2+ within perovskite lattice.258 Therefore, to obtain Mn-doped CsPbBr3 or CsPbI3 nanocrystals, one will need to first synthesize Mn-doped CsPbCl3 nanocrystals then substitute the halide anion via postsynthetic anion exchange by adding excess PbBr2 then PbI2. The dual emission phenomenon from the energy transfer between the host and the dopant seen in Mn-doped CsPbCl3 systems is less significant in the Mn-doped CsPbBr3 system and can hardly be seen in the Mn-doped CsPbI3 system. This is because of the energy level mismatch in the latter two cases. The energy difference (Δ) between the host perovskite band edge transition (CB-to-VB) and the dopant Mn transition (4T1-to-6A1) determine whether it is a forward energy transfer (kET) or a backward energy transfer (kBET) (Fig. 14).258 No Mn peak can be seen in the Mn-doped CsPbI3 system (bottom left panel of Fig. 14) because the small band gap of the host CsPbI3 results in backward energy transfer (kBET) from the Mn dopant to the perovskite host. The evolution of the exciton-to-Mn2+ energy transfer (ET) efficiency as a function of composition (Br/Cl ratio) and temperature in Mn2+-doped CsPb(Br/Cl)3 nanocrystals has been studied.259

 Fig. 14  The evolution of the energy level diagram of Mn-doped CsPbX3 (Mn:CsPbX3) nanocrystals during forward and reverse anion exchange. CB and VB denote the conduction and the valence band of the nanocrystal, respectively. The relative intensities of the two PL features of Mn:CsPbX3 nanocrystals are established by the interplay of rates of several competing processes including: band edge electron–hole recombination (keh), deactivation of the Mn2+-based d–d transition (kMn), and forward (kET) and back (kBET) energy transfer between the nanocrystal and the impurity. The competition between the latter two processes is also strongly influenced by the energy difference (Δ) between the band edge and Mn2+-based transitions. (top panel) The Δ in freshly prepared Mn:CsPbCl3 nanocrystals is large and positive, favoring forward energy transfer and strong Mn2+-based PL (yellow shading spectrum labeled as before in the top right box). After anion exchange with PbBr2, (bottom right panel) the Δ in resulting Mn:CsPbBr3 nanocrystals is still positive but much smaller; and some Mn2+ is lost to ion exchange with Pb2+. Both effects lead to reduced Mn2+-based PL (orange shading spectrum in the bottom right box; amplitude multiplied by a factor of 10). After further exchange with PbI2, (bottom left panel) the Δ in the obtained Mn:CsPbI3 nanocrystals is negative, resulting in no Mn2+-based PL (bottom left box). Finally, reverse anion exchange by sequentially exchanging Mn:CsPbI3 with PbBr2 then PbCl2 returns nanocrystals from Mn:CsPbI3 to Mn:CsPbBr3 then Mn:CsPbCl3 (top panel), restoring a large and positive Δ, leading to the re-emergence of Mn2+-based PL. Note that the intensity of the Mn2+-based PL is much smaller compared to the freshly prepared samples (orange shading labeled as After in the top right box), due to the loss of Mn2+ when Pb-containing exchange precursors are used.

The theory of bond dissociation energy difference mentioned above, suggests that the combination of PbCl2 (301 kJ mol−1) and MnBr2 (314 kJ mol−1), instead of PbBr2 (249 kJ mol−1) and MnCl2 (338 kJ mol−1), will create better Mn-doped CsPb(Cl/Br)3 nanocrystals because the difference in their bond dissociation energy is only 4% (much smaller than that of the later combination of 36%. Somewhat surprisingly, many research groups have used a combination of PbBr2 and MnCl2 precursors to achieve Mn-doped CsPb(Cl/Br)3via both a hot-injection approach260 and room temperature synthesis.261 Rationale for this seeming contradiction is still under debate. Successful synthetic procedures for doping Mn into CsPbBr3262 and CsPbCl3258 nanocrystals are very similar. The procedure for the former and latter are summarized below, respectively: heating a PbBr2/MnBr2/HBr mixture with capping ligands first, then swiftly inject Cs–oleate vs. heating PbCl2/MnCl2 mixture with capping ligands first, then swiftly inject Cs–oleate. The only differences in the previous case compared to the latter are the addition of HBr, some additional capping ligands, and a slightly different heating temperature. Therefore, it is possible that the addition of HBr is key to successfully doping Mn into CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. Their results suggest that Mn luminescent intensity is strongly depended on the amount of HBr used to control the x value in the L2[Pb1−xMnx]Br4 intermediate structure (where L = ligand).262 Although no other papers mentioned the importance of adding HBr during the Mn doping process, a few papers did mention the importance of adding HCl during the Mn doping process in CsPbCl3 systems.263–265 While PbCl2 and MnCl2 have been used as the Pb and Mn precursors for most of the Mn-doped CsPbCl3 studies, Xu et al. demonstrated that Mn-doped CsPbCl3 can also be achieved at room temperature through the use of lead(II) acetate (Pb(Ac)2), manganese(II) acetate (Mn(Ac)2), and a small amount of HCl acid solution.263 The acetate ligands in the metal acetate salts will be replaced by oleate ligands and form soluble metal–oleate complexes when dissolved in toluene with the presence of oleic acid and oleylamine. Hydrochloric acid is proposed to play two roles in the room-temperature synthesis of Mn-doped CsPbCl3: (1) protonating the carboxylate groups of the oleate ligand which increases the concentration of active metal monomers, and facilitates generation of CsPbCl3 nanocrystals and (2) providing excess Cl− to the surface of nanocrystals, increasing the potential binding sites for Mn2+. An optimal amount of HCl exists in order to obtain the highest Mn emission.263 It was proposed by Adhikari et al. that using alkylamine hydrochloride (RNH3Cl, created by mixing oleylamine and HCl) during synthesis will increase the reactivity of MnCl2 with PbCl2 in the hot-injection method and create more smaller particles, facilitating the slow Mn2+ doping process (no fast cooling required).264 Mn doping by slowly dripping a small volume of SiCl4 into a dispersion of CsPbCl3 nanocrystals (prepared by hot-injection method with the presence of manganese(II) stearate) in toluene at room temperature was also proposed by Lin et al.265 They found slow incorporation of Mn2+ when the reaction proceeded in air and no doping was found for the reaction run under vacuum. They proposed that this was due to the formation of HCl during the hydrolysis of SiCl4 with the water in air (by the reaction of SiCl4 + 2H2O → SiO2 + 4HCl). Under vacuum, there was no air (water) to trigger hydrolysis of SiCl4. HCl serves many purposes in this process: (1) reacts with the manganese(II) stearate precursor releasing Mn2+, (2) etches the surface of CsPbCl3 nanocrystals (by H+), and (3) reconstructs/passivates the surface of CsPbCl3 nanocrystals (by Cl−).265 Halide acid is not always necessary for Mn-doping; one group successfully doped Mn into CsPbI3 without the addition of HI by using hot-injection method with a combination of PbI2, MnI2 and Cs–oleate.266
In Mn-doped CsPbCl3 nanocrystals, the host exciton can undergo ultrafast nonradiative Auger-like recombination (τAug = ∼12 ps) when co-existing with the long-lived excited Mn-dopant state. Such a fast Auger-like process competes with the exciton-to-dopant spin-exchange internal energy transfer (IET, with τIET = ∼303 ps). The generation of multiple Mn-emission sites through consecutive IET is thus difficult, allowing for Mn-dopant emission from only one Mn2+ site per nanocrystal at a time. This is different from the Mn-doped CdS or CdSe quantum dots with consecutive exciton-to-dopant IET processes that generate multiple excited Mn-dopants per nanocrystal. Notably, such a dopant-induced Auger-like recombination corresponds to the broadly observed excitation-dependent saturation of dopant emission in Mn-doped nanocrystals.267 Mn-doped CsPbCl3 nanocrystals showed an energy transfer time (τET) of 380 ps, which is slower than the 70–190 ps energy transfer time of Mn-doped CdS/ZnS core/shell quantum dots.268 Because the exciton–Mn energy transfer time is longer for Mn-doped CsPbCl3 nanocrystals than Mn-doped CdS/ZnS core/shell quantum dots, it can be concluded that Mn-doped CsPbCl3 nanocrystals have weaker exciton–Mn exchange coupling than Mn-doped CdS/ZnS core/shell quantum dots.268 This is because, unlike Mn-doped CdS/ZnS core/shell quantum dots, CsPbCl3 nanocrystals (cubes with length of ∼10 nm in this specific study) are larger than their Bohr radius (the Bohr radius/exciton binding energy of CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3 are 2.5 nm/75 meV, 3.5 nm/40 meV, and 6 nm/20 meV, respectively)5 and therefore quantum confinement has no effect on exciton–dopant exchange coupling. In CsPbCl3 nanoplatelets, where the thickness of the CsPbCl3 nanoplatelets is smaller than their Bohr radius, enhanced dopant–carrier exchange interaction is observed due to strong quantum confinement effects.269
Excitation-dependent emission color tuning from an individual Mn-doped CsPbCl3 microcrystal with a wide color tuning range (reversible between orange and blue) has been reported (Fig. 15c). Mn-doped CsPbCl3 microcrystals were grown by immersing a lead(II) acetate (PbAc2)-coated glass slide in a mixed isopropanol solution containing MnCl2·4H2O and CsCl for about 48 h at room temperature, and exhibit dual-color emission from both perovskite host excitons (blue) and Mn-dopants (orange) via an exciton-to-dopant IET process (Fig. 15a). By simply changing the laser excitation repetition rate or pulse intensity, the relative emission intensity between exciton (Iexciton) and Mn-dopant (IMn) can be continuously and reversibly altered from IMn ≫ Iexciton to Iexciton ≫ IMn with increasing excitation intensity (Fig. 15b). Such emission color tuning is enabled by (1) the saturation of Mn-dopant emission at high excitation intensity through a bottlenecked energy transfer effect mediated by shallow trap states, and (2) a linear dependence of host exciton emission with excitation intensity. It has been demonstrated that this reversible emission color switching is highly photo-stable as the emission color can be switched between orange and blue for more than 300 cycles within a continuous 14 h operation.270 Up to 2% Mn-doped CsPbCl3 nanoplatelets, with dimensions of 32 nm by 9 nm (length by width) and thickness of 2.2 nm (4 monolayers), can be achieved through room temperature synthesis method (Fig. 16a).269 Room temperature synthesis of CsPbCl3 nanoplatelets was achieved by modifying the room temperature synthesis of CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets.271 In Mn-doped CsPbCl3 nanoplatelets, the CsPbCl3 excitonic PL (emission peaks around 400 nm in Fig. 16e) is quenched by the new midgap levels created by Mn d states. At the same time, the excitonic energy transferred from the perovskite host to the Mn2+ dopant leads to a spin-forbidden 4T1–6A1 Mn d-electron emission (emission peaks around 600 nm in Fig. 16e) and enhances the PLQY from 2.8% (undoped CsPbCl3 nanoplatelets) to 20% (0.8% Mn-doped CsPbCl3 nanoplatelets). Further increasing the doping ratio from 0.8% to 2% reduces PL efficiency. This decrease is probably due to the increase of intrinsic defects261 or due to increased interactions between neighboring Mn2+ ions, similar to cases of Mn-doped II–VI semiconductors where an optimal Mn-doping concentration exists.269 Undoped CsPbCl3 nanoplatelets possess a low PLQY of 2.8% (compared to CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets that usually show PLQY as high as 90%), which could be because there is a greater probability of capping molecules forming nonradiative deep midgap states for wider band gap semiconductors. Further anion exchange reactions can convert these Mn-doped CsPbCl3 nanoplatelets into Mn-doped CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets, which still exhibit weak Mn emission.269 Mn-doped CsPbBr3 perovskite magic sized clusters (PMSCs) and perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have been synthesized at a room temperature using manganese(II) chloride tetrahydrate (MnCl2·4H2O) and MnBr2 as Mn2+ dopant sources and benzoic acid (BA) and benzylamine (BZA) as passivating ligands.272 The fluorescence of Mn-doped CsPbBr3 PMSCs and PQDs synthesized with 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, and 0.40 mol of MnCl2·4H2O changed from green to blue, pink and orange (Fig. 17c). Their UV-vis spectra have two or three excitonic absorption peaks at 392/411/464, 395/452, 398/450 and 399/447 nm, respectively (Fig. 17a), and the corresponding PL spectra display multiple emission peaks at 398/412/471/585, 411/455/589, 411/454/590, and 411/455/591 nm, respectively (Fig. 17b), with increasing MnCl2·4H2O concentration.272 It may be possible that the Mn and Cl are simultaneously doped into the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, resulting in Mn-doped CsPb(Br/Cl)3 nanocrystals that show blue-shifted perovskite intrinsic peak with increasing amount of MnCl2 precursors, similar to the HEDCE previously discussed. We note that, in this study, such blue-shifted peak were attributed to the effect of passivation and smaller size nanocrystals formation from the additional Cl− ions.272 To this point, it is not known whether room temperature synthesis or hot-injection method is better for incorporating a higher Mn doping ratio. The Mn doping concentration using room temperature synthesis can be as high as 37% (CsPb0.63Mn0.37Cl3),261 while an Mn doping ratio of 46% (CsPb0.54Mn0.46Cl3) can be achieved by hot-injection.257 Room temperature synthesis may lead to higher doping ratio than high temperature synthesis because the doped Mn2+ ions could be ejected from the surface of nanocrystals (a phenomenon known as self-purification or self-annealing process) when subjected to high temperatures.261,273–275 Some scientists doubt the presence of the defect self-purification process in nanocrystals because the diffusion barriers for most defects cannot be readily overcome at temperatures used in colloidal synthesis (350 °C and below).276 Doping Mn2+ into traditional II–VI semiconductor quantum dots has been demonstrated to be more difficult than doping into bulk and was also proposed to be a result from the exclusion effect.258 At typical colloidal synthesis temperatures (<350 °C), the impurity diffusion rate into the semiconductor lattice is negligible and therefore the doping is accomplished via control over kinetic factors.258 A few approaches have been proposed to promote Mn inclusion. One approach is to take advantage of the strong binding of dopant ions to specific crystal facets, followed by material overgrowth. Another approach is to utilize polychalcogenide precursors which feature Mn directly bound to other lattice constituents in a cluster form, which will favor Mn's inclusion.258 One can tell whether the Mn-doping is substitutional or interstitial via XRD patterns of the perovskite powders/films. If the Mn doping is substitution, the XRD peak will shift to higher 2θ values indicating the incorporation of smaller Mn into the lattice sites of Pb. If the Mn doping is interstitial, the XRD peak will shift to lower 2θ, indicating an expansion of the crystalline lattice due to the insertion of Mn2+ ions in the interstices.277 Mn-doped CsPbCl3 nanocrystals were synthesized by the halide-rich method using manganese(IV) oxide (MnO2).278 When fabricated at the molar ratio of Pb/Mn/Cl = 1:1:8, Mn4+ (from MnO2) was witnessed to be reduced to Mn2+ (in the form of MnCl2) and dope into the CsPbCl3 lattice.278 Mn2+-doped CsPbCl3 nanocrystals have been synthesized using a single-step ultrasonic synthesis route, and triethylamine (TETN) was introduced to passivate the surface of Mn:CsPbCl3 nanocrystals.112 Gram-scale mass production of Mn2+-doped CsPbX3 nanocrystals have been achieved through a microwave-assisted hot injection method279 and a solvent-free mechano-synthesis approach.122 Mn2+-doped CsPbCl3 and CsPb(Br/Cl)3 nanocrystals have also been achieved through a room-temperature transformation doping method from Cs4PbX6 nanocrystals.280 Mn-Doped lead-free Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br) double perovskite nanocrystals have also been studied.281,282 Mn and Ni codoped CsPbCl3 perovskite nanocrystals have also been realized through the addition of NiCl2.283

In addition to the Mn-doped CsPbCl3 and Mn-doped CsPb(Cl/Br)3 noted above, Mn-doped organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites (MAPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) have also been achieved. Interestingly, all examples of Mn-doped organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites are based on room temperature synthesis approaches.258,284,285 It was also interesting to note that the Mn doping ratio in the MAPbCl3 and MAPb(Br/Cl)3 systems can be significantly higher than that of the Mn-doped CsPbCl3 and CsPb(Br/Cl)3 systems. The highest Mn doping ratio in CsPbCl3 and CsPb(Br/Cl)3 systems is 46%, while the Mn doping ratio in MAPbCl3 and MAPb(Br/Cl)3 systems can reach as high as 90% (Fig. 17d–f).284,285 The stark difference in the possible doping ratios of all-inorganic and organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites is attributed to the flexibility of the organic cation (CH3NH3+) network which can preserve perovskite structure better than the rigid inorganic cation (Cs+).284 It was found that 90% Mn-doping is roughly the solubility limit, and further inclusion of Mn to 100% will result in the formation of 2D (MA)2MnCl4 instead of 3D MAMnCl3. The transition is said to occur because Mn is smaller than Pb, and complete substitution will result in an unstable octahedral factor (μ) of less than 0.40.284 Due to limited space, many papers regarding Mn-doped perovskite nanocrystals are not covered in this review.286–293 You may refer to a recent review for a more comprehensive insight into Mn-doped perovskite nanocrystals.294
3.3. Lanthanide-based (trivalent substitution) perovskite nanocrystals
Rare-earth element lanthanide ions have widely been used to dope phosphors like Ce3+-doped Y3Al5O12 (cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet, YAG:Ce),295,296 and up-conversion nanoparticles such as Yb3+, Er3+ co-doped KMnF3 (KMnF3:Yb,Er)297,298 and NaYF4 (NaYF4:Yb,Er).299–301 The radius of Ce3+ is similar to that of Pb2+ (103 pm and 119 pm for Ce3+ and Pb2+, respectively)302 and has been doped in KPb2Cl5 and KPb2Br5 ternary lead halides.303 CeBr3 salt has been incorporated with hot-injection method to successfully dope Ce3+ into CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, resulting in an improved PLQY.302 Modified hot injection has also lead to successful lanthanide doping in Ce3+,Yb3+ co-doped CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 and Yb3+,Er3+ co-doped CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 nanocrystals.304 Ce3+,Yb3+ co-doped CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 (CsPbCl1.5Br1.5:Yb(7.1%),Ce(2%)) nanocrystals show a significantly high PLQY of 146% and a large absorption cross-section, which make them prime candidates for downconversion material.304 The PLQY can exceed 100% through a mechanism called the quantum-cutting effect, where one absorbed high-energy photon can downconvert into two emitting low-energy photons.305 When the two photons are emitted at a wavelength far away from their absorption edge (which means with large Stokes shift), the self-absorption loss can be eliminated and the PLQY can be doubled. Yb3+-doped CsPbCl3 nanocrystals synthesized via hot injection method have successfully demonstrated PLQY of 170% (close to the theoretical quantum-cutting limit of 200%), because they have emission in the NIR (∼1000 nm) range while their absorption is in the near UV (∼400 nm) range.306 It is proposed that the aliovalent Yb3+ dopants tend to form a cation vacancy charge-neutral defect complex (Yb3+–VPb–Yb3+), which facilitates trapping the excitation energy from the CsPbCl3 host (therefore almost no excitonic luminescence near absorption edge can be found). The trapped excitation energy is then divided to excite the two neighboring Yb3+ dopants followed by luminescent 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 f–f transitions of Yb3+ ions resulting in quantum-cutting NIR emission with PLQY approaching 200%.306–309 Density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrates that the charge-neutral Yb3+–VPb–Yb3+ complex does not create an inter-band gap defect energy level, and therefore different from the previous proposal, the energy donor in the quantum cutting process is actually the “right-angle” Pb atom rather than the Yb3+-induced defect.310 Yb3+ doping can also be achieved via postsynthetic exchange using Yb(NO3)3·5H2O in a mixture of methyl acetate:toluene (1:3 v/v) as precursor.311 In order to see the quantum-cutting mechanism of 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 f–f transitions, a fundamental energy-conservation threshold of Eg > 2 × Ef–f must exist, meaning that the absorption band gap of perovskite host must be adequately large. When continuously decreasing the band gap by tuning the x value from 0 to 1 in Yb3+-doped CsPb(Cl1−xBrx)3 nanocrystals, quantum-cutting effect can be retained for x values as large as ∼0.75 then a steep drop of PLQY is observed with larger x values.312 It has been proposed that the formation of a higher-concentration of defects can facilitate the introduction of a higher-concentration of Yb3+ dopant ions.313 Yb3+-doped Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br) double perovskite nanocrystals also exhibit NIR emission at ∼1000 nm.281,314 Although Yb3+-doped perovskite nanocrystals can show PLQY approaching 200% due to quantum cutting process, there is still obstacles preventing them from practical use as solar downconversion materials due to their PL power saturation under modest photoexcitation fluences.315 Eu3+-Doped CsPbBr3 and Tb3+-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals have been synthesized using a one-pot ultrasonication method.316 Various of lanthanide ions (Ce3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Er3+, and Yb3+) have been systematically studied and successfully doped into the lattices of CsPbCl3 perovskite nanocrystals through a modified hot-injection method using the corresponding lanthanide chloride salts as doping precursors.317 From the absorption spectra (Fig. 18a), it was found that as the atomic number of the lanthanide ion increased, the band gap of the host perovskite nanocrystals gradually blue-shifted due to lattice contraction, which is in good agreement with common band gap engineering literature.317 In the emission spectra (Fig. 18b), several peaks associated with the intrinsic electronic transitions of lanthanide ions can be found in the doped systems besides the narrow band-edge emission peak at around 410 nm. The overall PLQY of doped systems is enhanced mainly due to the contribution of intrinsic emissions from the lanthanide ions. Although the energy transfer from exciton of perovskite host to doping ions likely decreases the PLQY of the exciton, some nonradiative recombination pathways (such as Cl vacancy) may be removed during the doping and result in enhanced PLQY of exciton.317 LiYbF4:Tm3+@LiYF4 core/shell nanoparticles were used to sensitize CsPbX3 perovskite nanocrystals in order to achieve upconversion luminescence (UCL) through a radiative energy transfer upconversion (RETU) process. Lanthanide-doped core/shell nanoparticles function as the energy donor to convert the NIR excitation light into the UV and visible emission light through successive photon absorption and energy transfer upconversion (ETU) processes, then the emitted light from nanoparticles will be reabsorbed by perovskite nanocrystals.318 Bright blue light-emitting CsBr lead-free nanocrystals doped with Eu2+ have been achieved through hot-injection method.319 We note that discussion on a few more lanthanide-doped perovskite nanocrystals studies can be found in this review.320

3.4. Au (Au(0), Au(I), Au(II), Au(III)) and Ag-based perovskite nanocrystals
Interesting combinations can be observed when incorporating Au into perovskite systems due to the different valence charge states in gold systems. Cs2[AuIX2][AuIIIY4] (X, Y = halogen) gold mixed-valence complexes with mono-halogen (X = Y, i.e., Cs2Au2X6)321 or hetero-halogen (X ≠ Y)322 with distorted perovskite structures have both been achieved.323 The perovskite-type gold mixed-valence systems undergo either pressure-induced or photo-induced Au valence transition from the mixed-valence state of AuI,III to the single-valence state of AuII. The electrical properties of mixed-valence AuI,III complexes are attributed to the mobility of bipolarons, the dynamic two-electron exchange between the AuI and AuIII states, and can behave as either an insulator or metal, depending on pressure or temperature.321–323 Although the distorted perovskite structures of these Cs2[AuIX2][AuIIIY4] complexes are three-dimensional, the charge transfer interaction between AuI and AuIII within these complexes is two-dimensional through the bridging halogen Y, which sits in the a–b plane. Because the bridging halogen Y is responsible for controlling the pressure-induced gold valence transition in the Cs2[AuIX2][AuIIIY4] complexes, the critical pressure for the valence transition from AuI,III to AuII is distinct for different halogen systems.322,323 Besides the Au(I)/Au(III) and Au(II) states mentioned above, Au can also be incorporated into perovskite systems through Au(0) state.324 When introducing AuBr3 into a CsPbBr3 nanocrystal/toluene solution, gold nanoparticles can spontaneously form at the edge of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (Fig. 19a and b, from (1) CsPbBr3 to (2) Au–CsPbBr3). If AuCl3 is introduced to CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, gold nanoparticles will again form on their surface, and an anion exchange process forming Au–CsPb(Br1−xClx)3 nanocrystals will occur (Fig. 19a and b, from (1) CsPbBr3 to (3) Au–CsPb(Br1−xClx)3). It was proposed that the Au(III) ions can be reduced into Au(0) by the oleylamine on the surface of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, and subsequently nucleate and grow into Au nanoparticles on the corners of perovskite nanocrystals, without the assistance of any additional reducing agent (Fig. 19b).324 The PLQY of the nanocrystals is decreased when Au–CsPbBr3 or Au–CsPb(Br1−xClx)3 hybrid structures are formed suggesting that there is a charge-transfer process between the perovskite nanocrystal and the Au nanoparticles.324 Another study suggested that the formation of Au–CsPbBr3 hybrid structures may not always occur and sometimes a cation exchange process between Au ions and Pb ions may form Cs2AuIAuIIIBr6 nanocrystals, which have absorption in the NIR range (Fig. 19c–f).325 By introducing some PbBr2 salts at the same time as adding AuBr3 crystals, the existence of excess Pb ions competitively prevents the cation exchange of Au ions for Pb ions and insures there is no formation of Cs2AuIAuIIIBr6 nanocrystals (Fig. 19c–f, from (4) CsPbBr3 to (6) Au–CsPbBr3). The diameter of the deposited Au nanoparticles can be tuned by the concentration of additional Au(III) ions. The formation of Cs2AuIAuIIIBr6 nanocrystals can be considered an alternative synthetic strategy for Pb-free perovskites via a postsynthetic cation exchange process. The formation of Au–CsPbBr3 hybrid nanocrystals can provide improved catalytic activity due to the plasmon–exciton coupling effect and the metal domains of Au–CsPbBr3 hybrid heterostructures can act as electrical contact points for nanoscale optoelectronic devices.325 Silver ions (Ag+) have also been proposed to heterovalently dope colloidal CsPbBr3 nanocrystals via substituting Pb2+ ions and significantly improve the conductivity and charge-carrier mobility by nearly 3 orders of magnitude. Heterovalent doping of Ag+ has been found to shift the Fermi level downward to the valence band and induce a p-type character in Ag+-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals and significantly improve the conductivity and charge-carrier mobility by nearly 3 orders of magnitude compared to the undoped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, confirmed by field effect transistor (FET) studies.326 In another study, however, Ag+ ions were proposed to replace Cs+ ions instead of Pb2+ ions and claimed to simultaneous dope and surface passivate the CsPbI3 nanocrystals film in LED device.327

3.5. Other divalent (isovalent) substitution perovskite nanocrystals
Other than the widely studied Sn-doped and Mn-doped systems, a few other divalent cations have also been tested in doping colloidal metal halide perovskite nanocrystals. Alkaline-earth (AE) metals (e.g., Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+) have been proposed to be used as dopants to substitute Pb2+ in halide perovskites through a one-pot synthetic method.328 AE metal chloride (i.e., MgCl2, CaCl2, SrCl2, and BaCl2) were added to the other precursors during synthesis of CsPbCl3 perovskite nanocrystals, and it was found that the incorporation effectiveness of AE2+ ions in CsPbCl3 nanocrystals are quite different. It was found that only Ba2+ can be incorporated into the core of nanocrystals, while Ca2+ and Sr2+ stay at/near the surface of nanocrystals, passivating the nonradiative recombination surface vacancies and significantly enhancing PLQY (pristine CsPbCl3: 0.8%; Ca2+-doped CsPbCl3: 77.1%). Mg2+ found to rarely incorporate into the nanocrystals, neither in the core nor at the surface, probably due to its relatively small ionic radius (ionic radius: Mg2+ = 0.72 Å, Ca2+ = 1.00 Å, Sr2+ = 1.18 Å, Ba2+ = 1.35 Å, Pb2+ = 1.19 Å), which results in a notable self-purification effect that excludes Mg2+ outside the lattice.328 SrCl2 has also been used as a co-precursor during CsPbI3 nanocrystals synthesis to simultaneously dope Sr2+ ions and passivate the surface with Cl− ions. Because Sr2+ has a smaller ionic radius (1.18 Å) than Pb2+ (1.19 Å), it can cause a slight contraction in CsPbI3 lattice, resulting in improved stability. At the same time, Cl− ions can passivate surface defects of CsPbI3 nanocrystals, resulting in enhanced PL.329 SrI2 has also been used to stabilize cubic phase α-CsPbI3 nanocrystals, and a high PLQY of 80% can be maintained even after storage for two months.330 Ni2+, with the smallest ionic and Shannon radii among all transition metal ions, has been used to dope CsPbI3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbCl3 nanocrystals using NiI2, NiBr2, and NiCl2 as precursors, respectively.208,331–334 It was found that Ni2+ doping can restrict the phase change of CsPbI3 nanocrystals from α-CsPbI3 to δ-CsPbI3 and significantly improve their stability.331 While violet emitting CsPbCl3 nanocrystals usually have relatively low PLQYs (<5%),335 Ni2+ doping was found to boost the PLQY of violet emitting CsPbCl3 nanocrystals from 2.4% up to 96.5%.333 Similarly, postsynthetic treatment of CsPbCl3 nanocrystals using CdCl2 can also boost the PLQY of violet emitting CsPbCl3 nanocrystals from 3% up to 96 ± 2% and maintain its original PL peak position (406 nm) and peak width (FWHM ∼10–12 nm).336 By adding optimum amount of CuCl2 during hot-injection synthesis of CsPbCl3 nanocrystals, the PLQY of violet-emitting CsPbCl3 nanocrystals can be boosted from ∼0.5% to 60% with an emission peak position (λem) at 403 nm, and the PLQY of halide-exchanged CsPb(Cl/Br)3 can be boosted from ∼8% to ∼92% (for sample with λem = 430 nm) and from 22% to 98% (for sample with λem = 460 nm).335 All the abovementioned Ni, Cd, and Cu-doped CsPbCl3 and CsPb(Cl/Br)3 nanocrystals exhibit no blue shift in the PL peak position, even though one would be expected from lattice contraction associated with the incorporation of relatively smaller Ni2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+ ions. One study demonstrated, however, that doping smaller Cu2+ ions can boost the PLQY of CsPb(Br/Cl)3 nanocrystals from 23% to 80% but would also blue shift the wavelength from 466 nm to 453 nm.337 It has been demonstrated that CsPbCl3 nanocrystals only experience a massive boost in PLQY when treated with Cu(II)X2 precursors (when treated with CuCl2 or CuBr2, the PLQY of CsPbCl3 can be boosted from 2.7% to 12.3% (CuCl2 treatment) and 92.6% (CuBr2 treatment)), and not when treated with Cu(I)X precursors (when treated with CuCl or CuBr the PLQY of CsPbCl3 showed improvements of only 2.7% (CuCl treatment) and 22.3% (CuBr treatment)).338 Simply by increasing the Cu doping concentration, the emission wavelength of MAPb1−xCuxBr3 can be tuned from 468 nm to 513 nm.339 Co2+ doping in CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals can lead to effective catalytic sites for CO2 reduction.80 Partial substitution of Pb2+ with Zn2+ in CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals exhibited an improved, close-to-unity PLQY of 98.5% due to the increased radiative decay rate and decreased non-radiative decay rate.340 A postsynthetic cation exchange method was used to dope CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with metal(II) ions by dissolving metal(II) bromide salts (MBr2 = SnBr2, CdBr2, ZnBr2) in oleylamine and adding it to a perovskite nanocrystal–toluene solution at room temperature inside a nitrogen-purged glovebox.227 Using metal(II) bromide salts ensures that no anion exchange occurs and any change is solely coming from cation exchange. Blue-shifted absorption and PL spectra were observed in all three cases (Fig. 20), but the blue-shift behaviors vary from case to case and strongly depend on the precursor concentration and the type of divalent cation. For the case of postsynthetic reaction with SnBr2, the blue-shift is small for both low and high SnBr2 concentrations. Postsynthetic reactions with CdBr2 and ZnBr2 lead to more pronounced blue-shifts than those seen with SnBr2. The size, shape, high PLQYs (over 60%), and colloidal stability in toluene of parent CsPbBr3 nanocrystals were maintained for at least several months after the reactions with metal(II) bromide salts. 1D powder electron diffraction (PED) patterns (obtained by azimuthally integrating the 2D electron diffraction (ED) patterns) show that the lattice contracts more after reaction with CdBr2 and ZnBr2 salts than with SnBr2 (Fig. 20f and g). This is expected due to the differences in the ionic radii (r(Pb2+) = 119 pm, r(Sn2+) = 118 pm, r(Cd2+) = 95 pm, r(Zn2+) = 74 pm, and coordination number (CN) = 6 in all cases).227 The cation exchange process is often limited by the diffusion rates of the outgoing and incoming cations, which is often attributed to vacancy-mediated migration which is limited by the formation energy of each vacancy. Cation diffusion in perovskites is relatively much slower than that of anions because cations have higher activation energies and lack of interstitial sites for interstitial diffusion. Therefore, the postsynthetic cation exchange in this study is very slow and only partially occurs despite the large excess amount of M2+ cations used. It was suggested that the amount of oleylamine added also plays an important role in the ion exchange process because the amount of oleylamine (OLAM) will affect the amount of OLAM–Br complex (between both host perovskite and MBr2 dopant) and that strongly affects the number of halide vacancy generated (Fig. 21).227 We note that the abbreviation for oleylamine in the whole paper is not consistent due to the different abbreviations used in different schematic figures. Transition metal halides (FeX3, CoX2, NiX2, CuX2, and ZnX2) have also been used to dope CsPbX3 nanocrystals.341 Similary, metal(II) bromide salts (MBr2 = ZnBr2, MnBr2, EuBr2) have been used to convert Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals into CsPbxM1−xBr3 nanocrystals,342 following an earlier finding that excess PbBr2 would transform Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals into CsPbBr3 nanocrystals.343

 Fig. 21  Schematic representation of the proposed cation exchange reaction mechanism. In the first step, surface halide vacancies are created by oleylamine (OLAM) molecules in solution. In the second step, a Br anion of an OLAM–MBr2 unit occupies the halide vacancy. In a third step, the bound OLAM molecule extract a PbBr2 unit, leaving a cation and halide vacancy behind, which are occupied by the bound MBr2 species. Finally, the incorporated divalent guest cation diffuses into the perovskite lattice, leaving behind a halide vacancy at the surface for a second cation exchange process to occur.

3.6. Other trivalent (heterovalent) substitution perovskite nanocrystals
Scientists have also considering doping Bi to replace Pb because Bi3+ and Pb2+ are isoelectronic (i.e., both electron configurations are the same as [Xe]4f145d106s26p0). Incorporating heterovalent Bi3+ ions may induce electronic doping (act as electron donor) by increasing the charge carrier density in the lead halide perovskites. Doping heterovalent Bi3+ ions in colloidal CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals has been achieved by hot-injection method with a combination of BiBr3, PbBr2, and Cs–oleate (Fig. 22A–D).344 Through the use of Kelvin probe, time-resolved transient absorption, and photoemission spectroscopy in air (PESA), it was demonstrated that Bi3+ doping not only affects the band structure and carrier dynamics of CsPbBr3, but also the interfacial charge transfer between Bi-doped CsPbBr3 and two well-known molecular electron acceptors, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM).344 The driving-force of interfacial charge transport, Gibbs free energy (−ΔG) between the molecular acceptor and donor moieties, can be tuned upon metal doping.344 Interestingly, band gap broadening (blue-shift) was found in the Bi-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (Fig. 22C), and band gap narrowing (red-shift) was found in most Bi-doped single crystal cases including Bi-doped CsPbBr3 (Fig. 22F),345 Bi-doped MAPbBr3,346 and Bi-doped MAPbCl3 single crystals.347 One study claimed Bi-doping had no effect on the band gap of Bi-doped MAPbBr3 single crystals, but instead significantly increases the sub-band gap density of states, which other studies incorrectly interpreted as band gap narrowing.348 Though the effect of band gap narrowing or broadening is contradictory to each other in the single crystal and nanocrystal cases, there is no doubt that Bi-doping can affect the electronic properties of the host crystals. By sandwiching a ∼2 mm thick Bi-doped perovskite single crystal in between two ∼100 nm thick Au electrodes, the metal–semiconductor–metal configuration demonstrated current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of an Ohmic contact for the undoped single crystal (e.g., CsPbBr3345 or MAPbCl3347), and showed that conductivity increased with Bi-doping content, probably due to higher carrier concentration and alteration of the metal–semiconductor band alignment.345 High-level DFT calculations demonstrate that replacing Pb2+ with Bi3+ ions in the bulk or on the surface creates deep trap states that remove the defect-tolerant nature of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals and function as nonradiative recombination centers significantly quenching the PL intensity. Conversely, Ce3+ ions can stabilize the bulk/surface structure of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals providing band-edge states that leads to PL enhancement.349 Besides Bi3+, a few other trivalent ions have been examined as heterovalent dopants in lead halide perovskite systems. Sb3+ doping in super small blue emitting CsPbBr3 nanocrystals is suggested to reduce the surface energy, improve the lattice energy, passivate the defect states below the band gap, and boosting their blue emitting PLQY from 50.0% to 73.8%.350 Au3+ and In3+ have been successfully incorporated into MAPbBr3 single crystals by the addition of AuBr3 and InBr3 salts, however they did not exhibit significant spectral changes (band gap narrowing).346 They suggested that the outer ns2 electrons play a critical role in band gap modulation and DFT calculations also suggested that Au and In create deeper, more localized states than Bi.346 Al3+ has been successfully incorporated in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals by the addition of AlBr3 salt, and a blue-shift in the emission was observed.351 They suggested that the blue-shifted emission was due to the extended band gap of Al-doped nanocrystals as well as the quantum confinement effect originating from the elongated shape of Al-doped nanocrystals. The bond dissociation energy of Al2Br6 (the dimeric form of AlBr3) needs to be considered during the incorporation because of the possibility of retention of some Al–Br (bridging) bonds.351 The introduction of foreign Bi3+, Al3+, and In3+ ions to CsPbBr3 nanocrystals by adding BiBr3, BiFeO3, BiCl3, AlBr3 or InBr3 into the synthesis precursors will function as capping ligands and led to partial formation of growth-constrained thinner perovskite nanoplatelets with a thickness of 3 inorganic PbBr42− octahedron layers. The final products will be a mixture nanoplateles with two different thicknesses, as seen by two well-defined absorption and emission bands.352 Fe(II)-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals can be efficient photocatalysts for reduction of CO2 without the need of any additional carrier transportation material or heterostructures. During photocatalytic reduction of CO2, undoped CsPbBr3 led to CO as the major product while Fe(II)-doped CsPbBr3 led to CH4 as the dominant product.82 Fe(III)-doped CsPbCl3 nanocrystals shows a pink-colored dual emission consisting of a sharp blue emission at 410 nm from the excitonic peak of CsPbCl3 and a broad red emission at ∼580 nm result from the 4T1 → 6A1 (d–d) radiative transition of Fe3+ dopant.353 Gadolinium (Gd3+) doping was found to enhance the phase stability of α-CsPbI3 nanocrystals from 5 days to 11 days probably due to the reasons of increased tolerance factor, distorted cubic symmetry, and decreased defect density.354

Lower toxicity bismuth (Bi3+), antimony (Sb3+), and indium (In3+) ions are commonly used heterovalent ions for lead (Pb2+) ion substitution in perovksite systems. To meet charge neutrality, the final product of lead-free substitution with trivalent ions will no longer be ABX3 but will be either A3B2X9 (e.g., (MA)3Bi2Br9355 and Cs3Sb2Br9356) or A2B′B′′X6 (e.g., Cs2AgBiX679,357,358 and Cs2AgInX6282,359–361) double perovskite. The structure of A3B2X9 can be visualized by removing every third layer of B atoms along the 〈111〉 direction of ABX3 perovskite structure,356 and the structure of A2B′B′′X6 can be thought of as doubling the ABX3 perovskite unit cell and replacing the B atoms alternatively with M+ and M3+ cations.357 CH3NH3Br and BiBr3 were used to prepare the (MA)3Bi2Br9 nanocrystals through a LARP method at room temperature and obtained blue emitting nanocrystals with emission peak at 423 nm, FWHM of 62 nm, and PLQY of up to 12%.355 Similarly CsBr and SbBr3 were used to prepare the Cs3Sb2Br9 nanocrystals through LARP method and obtained blue emitting nanocrystals with emission peak at 410 nm, FWHM of 41 nm, and PLQY of up to 46%.356 The emission wavelength of both (MA)3Bi2Br9 and Cs3Sb2Br9 nanocrystals can be tuned between ∼360 nm to ∼550 nm via halide substitutions. It was proposed that a Br-rich (SbBrx) surface passivation resulted in the relatively high PLQY of their Cs3Sb2Br9 nanocrystals, similar to Br-rich (PbBrx) surface passivation proposed in the CsPbX3 systems.362 Cs3Bi2Br9 nanocrystals have been synthesized through a similar room temperature LARP method, and it was proposed that after addition of deionized (DI) water, a self-passivating layer of BiOBr was formed which led to enhanced PL and improved stability. Similar improvement was not observed in the (MA)3Bi2Br9 systems.71 The optical properties of Cs3Bi2X9 nanocrystals71,363 displayed a rough trend of slightly red-shifting, with slightly higher quantum yield when compared to (MA)3Bi2X9 nanocrystals,355,364 though some exceptions exist. Cs3Sb2X9 nanocrystals356 present a wider emission range than both Cs3Bi2X9 and (MA)3Bi2X9 nanocrystals, and possess a much higher quantum yield for the iodide nanocrystals (Fig. 23 and Table 4). Ligand-free Cs3Bi2X9 nanocrystals with emission ranging from 400 nm to 560 nm have been synthesized through a one-pot room temperature method similar to the ligand-capped nanocrystals using various CsX and BiX3 halide salts as precursors (Fig. 24).365 The ligand-free nanocrystals exhibited much lower PLQYs than ligand-capped nanocrystals but the PLQY of ligand-free Cs3Bi2Br9 nanocrystals can be improved by storing in open air, which probably facilitates perovskite hydrate formation on the nanocrystal surface passivating surface trap-states.365 Cs3Bi2I9 nanocrystals have been synthesized using a hot-injection method with BiI3 as a precursor, and the coexistence of direct–indirect transitions of their band gap was discussed.366 Cs3Bi2I9 and Rb3Bi2I9 are considered as 0D and 2D structure, respectively.367

In the A2B′B′′X6 double perovskite cases, the ionic radii of Bi3+ (1.03 Å) and Ag+ (1.15 Å) are similar to that of Pb2+ (1.19 Å) and are commonly used for heterovalent substitutions.368 Double perovskites made from Bi3+ could possess defect-tolerance similar to the perovskites made from Pb2+ because of the isoelectronic nature of Bi3+ and Pb2+.369 Some other possible candidates for M3+ are Sb3+ (0.76 Å), In3+ (0.80 Å), and Ga3+ (0.62 Å) (As3+ is less desirable due to its toxicity). Possible candidates for M+ are Cu+ (0.77 Å), Na+ (1.02 Å), and Au+ (1.37 Å).368,369 Based on calculations, the band gaps for Bi3+ and Sb3+ double perovskites tend to be indirect and smaller than 2.7 eV,368 while Cs2InAgX6 tend to be direct band gap, which is more suitable for photovoltaic applications.359 Mn-doped Cs2AgInCl6 double perovskite nanocrystals have been achieved through a hot injection method. These doped nanocrystals exhibited a bright orange PL emission with PLQY of ∼16%, which contrasts greatly with the white PL emission and PLQY of ∼1.6% displayed by undoped Cs2AgInCl6 nanocrystals (Fig. 25a).282 Direct band gap undoped and Ag-doped Cs2NaInCl6 double perovskite nanocrystals have been synthesized via hot injection method.370 Varying the amount of Na alloying in Cs2NaxAg1−xBiCl6 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1) double perovskites leads to increase in their optical band gaps (from 3.39 eV for x = 0 to 3.82 eV for x = 1) and significant improvement in their weak PLs (a 30-fold increment).371 Study reveals that the Bi3+ dopants inside the Bi-doped Cs2Ag1−xNaxInCl6 double perovskite nanocrystals introduce BiCl6 states that localize just below the CBM are essential for observing any PL emission, while the Ag+ ions in the double perovskite structure give rise to localized AgCl6 energy levels just above the VBM under Na-rich conditions.372 The color temperatures of white emitting colloidal Cs2Ag1−xNaxIn1−yBiyCl6 nanocrystals can be tuned by the amount of Na+ and Bi3+ incorporation (x = 0–1, y = 0.03–0.16).373 Doping with lanthanide ions (Yb3+ and Er3+) can further red shift the visible emission of Cs2AgInCl6 nanocrystals to NIR emission with characteristic f–f transition peaks at 996 nm for Yb3+ and 1537 nm for Er3+ dopants (Fig. 25b).360 Cs2InBiX6 and Cs2InSbX6 In(I)-based double perovskites have been proposed to be intrinsically unstable, because In(I) easily oxidizes to In(III).374 Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br) nanocrystals have been successfully synthesized through hot-injection approaches using acetates (Cs(OAc), Ag(OAc), Bi(OAc)3) as cation precursors and trimethylsilyl halide (TMSCl or TMSBr),357 hydrochloric acid (HCl), or bromotrimethylsilane as halide precursors.358 Cs2AgBiBr6 colloidal nanocrystals have also been successfully synthesized through hot-injection approaches using Cs2CO3, BiBr3, and AgNO3,79 or AgBr358 as precursors. Formation of quaternary Cs2AgBiX6 colloidal nanocrystals requires careful balancing of the reactivities and chemical potentials of the individual components. If balance is not achieved, impurities such as AgX, CsX, Cs–Bi–X or Cs–Ag–X ternary phases (e.g., Cs3BiX6) may form.357 It was found that addition of a small amount of hydrobromic acid (HBr) is critical to ensure the full ionization of Ag+, which prevents the formation of AgBr impurity in the final product. The injection temperature and the existence of oleylamine are also key factors for successful synthesis because BiBr3 would remain insoluble at temperatures below 160 °C or without the addition of oleylamine.79 Ligand-free Cs2AgBiBr6 nanocrystals have, however, been successfully synthesized using CsBr, AgBr and BiBr3 as precursors through a room temperature anti-solvent recrystallization method without heat treatment or oleylamine.375 These ligand-free Cs2AgBiBr6 nanocrystals exhibit a sub-band gap long absorption tail originating from surface defects on nanocrystals and could be suppressed by the addition of oleic acid surfactants.375 The degradation products of Cs2AgBiBr6 have been proposed to be a combination of two different ternary cesium bismuth bromides (i.e., Cs3Bi2Br9 and Cs3BiBr6), elemental silver, and bromine.358

3.7. Size-dependent doping regime
Though highly challenging, pinpointing the exact location or distribution of dopants within a host matrix and understanding the underlying mechanisms of doping is of key importance. Whether foreign ions can be fully incorporated within or simply segregate on the surface of the perovskite crystals depends heavily on the dopant's ionic radii. Take the incorporation of divalent alkaline earth metal ions in MA-based perovskite as an example. Theoretical calculations have predicted that Sr2+ can replace Pb2+ in the perovskite lattice because Sr2+ and Pb2+ have similar ionic radii (118 pm and 119 pm, respectively) and the tolerance factor of MASrI3 (0.91) falls within the stable 3D perovskite structure range (0.8 to 1.0).376 Despite that, the synthesis of a pure 3D MASrI3 halide perovskite has not yet been reported. In Sr-doped perovskite films, a Sr-rich secondary phase has been observed to form on the surface.377 On the other hand, Mg2+, with a smaller ionic radius (72 pm), cannot form stable MAMgI3 as its tolerance factor (1.06) is not within the stable 3D perovskite structure range (0.8 to 1.0).377Fig. 26a and b show the grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns of Sr and Mg-doped tetragonal MAPbI3. No additional peaks were seen upon the addition of Sr2+ and Mg2+, indicating no new crystalline phases are formed. The lack of an identifiable secondary phase suggested that the surface segregated phase is either amorphous or too thin (or too dispersed) to be detected by GIXRD. Le Bail refinement and the effect of GIXRD patterns broadening were used to characterise the microstrain due to doping. As schematically shown in Fig. 26c, the microstrain represents a local distortion of the lattice, which can be revealed as a broadening of the peaks. No systematic XRD peak shift was observed, signifying the absence of lattice macrostrain or homogenous changes in the crystal structure. The microstrain evolution of the Sr doping (Fig. 26d) and Mg doping (Fig. 26e) series showed that the perovskite lattice can accumulate distortion up to a critical doping level, after which the lattice relaxes back probably due to the formation of segregated secondary phase. The microstrain of Sr-doped samples reached a maximum value at a doping concentration of 0.2% and quickly droped to a value similar to the undoped sample at higher concentrations. This suggested that phase segregation dominated the doping process, with dopant lattice incorpation only occurring within the low doping regime of 0.2. On the other hand, the microstrain in Mg-doped samples showed a more gradual decrease after the maximum was reached at doping concentration of 1%, implying both lattice incorporation and lattice relaxation due to segregation can occur simultaneously at concentrations higher than 1%. It is hypothesized that dopants are incorporated into the perovskite lattice until a critical distortion is attained, beyond which the dopant starts to segregate at the surface, resulting in a relaxation of the perovskite lattice. The findings that Mg2+ has a higher inclusion concentration than Sr2+ (despite the more favorable tolerance factor of Sr2+) suggests a plausible scenario of Mg2+ inclusion in interstitial positions.377 The Mg-doped perovskite lattice only shows contraction in the c-direction while the Sr-doped perovskite lattice displays uniform changes in both directions. It can be concluded true incorporation of the dopant into the perovskite lattice occurs within the low doping concentration regime (0.1–1 mol%). In contrast, the high doping concentration regime (3–10 mol%, such as those numbers commonly used in the literature) results in surface phase segregation. Moreover, it was also found that, for one dopant (Sr2+ or Mg2+), the low doping regime induces a more n-type doping character, yet the high doping regime triggers a less n-type doping feature, which is different from classical doping in silicon system.377

4. X-site substitution
Tuning the emission band gap of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals differs from traditional II–VI, III–V, and IV–VI semiconductor quantum dots because instead of altering dimensionality to utilize quantum confinement effects,6,7,113,126,136,187,190,191,379–385 the emission band gap of metal halide perovskite nanocrystals is primarily tuned by their halide compositions.5,386,387 For lead halide perovskite, the maximum wavelength difference that can be tuned by quantum confinement effects is roughly 100 nm (Fig. 27a), which is relatively narrow compared to greater than 300 nm range that can be tuned via varying halide compositions (Fig. 27b).191

4.1. Halide-based perovskite nanocrystals
Compared to cation-exchange, anion-exchange in perovskite systems is relatively fast and easy. Mixed-halide perovskite (e.g., CsPb(Br/Cl)3 or CsPb(Br/I)3) colloidal nanocrystals can be achieved by either direct synthesis strategy of directly using mixed-anion precursors during nanocrystals synthesis, or by postsynthetic strategy of adding excess amounts of Cl or I halide precursors into as prepared colloidal bromide-based perovskite (e.g., MAPbBr3 or CsPbBr3) nanocrystal suspensions.386 Options for Cl or I halide precursors include: lead halides (PbX2),386,388 organoammonium halides (such as octadecylammonium halides (ODA-X),386 oleylammonium halides (OLAM-X)),386,387,389 and aryl-based aniline hydrohalide (An-HX).389 Fast anion-exchange kinetics in halide perovskites are likely due to their low defect formation energy, the rigid nature of their cationic sublattice, and the high ion mobility in the lattice due to the prevalence of vacancies.390,391 Although both chlorine exchange and iodine exchange of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are kinetic processes and demonstrate no thermodynamic preference for these two anions, their anion exchange mechanisms are actually different: the chlorine exchange is likely diffusion-limited, whereas the iodine exchange is likely surface-limited.392 In most cases, the parent CsPbBr3 nanocrystals retain their cubic (Fig. 28a)387 or orthorhombic (Fig. 28b)390 structures during their anion-conversion from CsPbBr3 to CsPbI3 or CsPbCl3.95 There are also cases where CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are transformed from cubic to orthorhombic when increasing the I− anion-exchange level (Fig. 28c),388 which indicates that CsPbBr3−xIx nanocrystals do not form a continuous solid solution over the entire I− anion-exchange range (from 0 ≤ x ≤ 3).95 These contradictory findings may be due to anion-exchanged CsPbI3 nanocrystals gradually undergoing a phase transition from black cubic phase to their thermodynamically preferred yellow orthorhombic phase.393 Conversely, the shape and crystal structure of the parent CsPbBr3 nanocrystals is retained while undergoing the Br–Cl exchange process.388 There are still limitations for band gap tuning via halide substitutions. In perovskites, the conduction band (Ec) (electron affinity) and valence band (Ev) (ionization potential) energies are dictated mostly by the atomic orbitals of the cations and anions, respectively.394 The valence orbitals change from 3p to 4p to 5p with a monotonic decrease in electron binding energy (lower ionization potential) during the halide substitution from Cl to Br to I, with most offset shown in the valence band (ΔEv).158 For example, the band gaps for MAPbX3 can only be changed from 3.11, 2.22, to 1.51 eV for X = Cl, Br, and I, respectively,395 which indicates that in order to obtain perovskites with band gaps smaller than 1.51 eV, an offset in the conduction band is also required, which would require substitution of a B-site cation.

Colloidal metal halide perovskite nanocrystals display fast exchange dynamics in solution, even in the absence of an excess halide source. Simply mixing two different colloidal halide perovskite nanocrystal suspensions in one vial would result in anion-exchange between these two nanocrystals.386,387 Solution-phase is not a prerequisite for anion exchange, as solid-state anion exchange was also observed when mixing two different halide perovskite dried powders or mixing perovskite powders with other halide containing solids (e.g., KCl, KBr, KI).396 Only Cl–Br and Br–I couples (and never for Cl–I couples) are attainable in halide exchange. Attempts to yield CsPbCl3 directly from CsPbI3 nanocrystals (or vice versa) through anion-exchange or mixing CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3 nanocrystals together to obtain intermediate CsPb(Cl/I)3 nanocrystals have yet to be succeeded. Generally, the PL is completely diminished, suggesting a total dissolution of particles. One possible explanation is that due to the large difference in ionic radii between Cl− and I−, the direct exchange between Cl− and I− would involve a structural stress on the lattice that cannot be tolerated, resulting in destruction of perovskite nanocrystals.386 Researchers have demonstrated heterojunction cesium lead halide perovskite nanowires, where different segments of the same nanowire contain of different halide ions. For example, half of the nanowire could be CsPbBr3 while the other half is CsPbI3 or CsPbCl3 (Fig. 29A–G). This heterojunction structure perovskite was achieved by a very delicately controlled anion exchange process where a segment of a nanowire was partially coated in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) while the other segment underwent anion exchange.391 Besides using delicate PMMA masking to achieve desired anion exchange patterning, anion exchange patterning via photo-excitation has also been demonstrated. Light can trigger photoinduced anion exchange in CsPbX3 nanocrystal–dihalomethane solutions (Fig. 30).397 The accepted mechanism for this novel phenomenon is that photoexcited CsPbX3 nanocrystals transfer an interfacial electron to a dihalomethane (e.g., dichloromethane (DCM) or dibromomethane (DBM)) solvent molecule, and halide anions are produced in situ by the reductive dissociation due to the transferred electron. The extent of photoinduced anion-exchange reaction can be precisely controlled by either changing the photon dose or wavelength of the excitation light.397

4.2. SCN-based perovskite nanocrystals
Pseudo-halide thiocyanate ions (SCN−, which has a similar ionic radius to I−) were first introduced to partially replace the iodide ions in MAPbI3 thin film solar cells to improve the stability/moisture tolerance of the cells and were found to also increase the crystal size.398–402 It was found that individual MAPbI3−x(SCN)x crystals demonstrate spatially heterogeneous PL emission, with substantially higher intensity at the grain boundaries as compared to the interior regions of the crystals.403 Studies have since revealed that the proposed MAPbI3−x(SCN)x 3D-connected perovskite structure may actually be (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 2D-layered orthorhombic structure instead, where Pb is octahedrally coordinated by four I− ions and two S-bonded SCN− ligands, while the MA+ cations are situated between the layers of Pb(SCN)2I4 octahedra (similar to a K2NiF4-type structure).404 DFT calculation has shown that (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 has improved chemical stability against phase separation and does not spontaneously decompose into either MAI + Pb(SCN)2 (with ΔH = 0.38 eV) or MA(SCN) + PbI2 (with ΔH = 1.97 eV). As a comparison, it is thermodynamically favorable for MAPbI3 to spontaneously decompose into MAI + PbI2 (with ΔH = −0.09 eV).405 Another study claimed, because of their observation of red solid phase decomposing into black solid under ambient humidity, that it is possible for 3(MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 to decompose into 2MAPbI3 + 4MA(SCN) + Pb(SCN)2 by hydration.406 These 2D-layered (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 single crystals displays a reversible piezochromism phenomena. When compressed in a diamond-anvil cell, the color of single crystals changes from translucent red (1 GPa) to opaque black (2.6 GPa), then to translucent yellow (3.9 GPa), and finally retains this color up to 4.3 GPa, suggesting a substantial change in the corresponding band gap.406 A′A′′Pb(SCN)2I2-type 2D perovskite films have been systematically studied by replacing the cation species (A′A′′) with combinations of MA, FA, and Cs cations.407 Despite the wide study of thiocyanate-based perovskite films, thiocyanate-based perovskite nanocrystals are rarely studied. SCN-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals have been achieved by replacing a small amount of Br− ions with SCN− ions forming CsPbBr3−x(SCN)x nanocrystals. This substitution led to an increase in the crystallinity and a slightly blue-shifted PL peak, without significant change in their shapes or crystal structures.162
4.3. Split-anion-based perovskite nanocrystals
Some scientists have proposed partially replacing some of the halide anions (Cl, Br, I) in perovskite with chalcogen anions (S, Se, Te), forming a so-called “split-anion” system with mixed chalcogen and halogen anions. This strategy is mostly employed in antimony or bismuth-based perovskites (e.g., MASbI2S,408 and MABiI2S409).410,411 The potential benefit of such Pb-free perovskites with mixed chalcogen and halogen anions, AB(Ch,X)3 (A = Cs or Ba; B = Sb or Bi; Ch = chalcogen (S, Se, Te); X = halogen (Cl, Br, I)), is that the metal–chalcogenide bonds are more covalent than metal-halide bonds and as such may exhibit an enhanced stability under ambient conditions.411 Solar cells fabricated from Pb-free perovskites with mixed chalcogen and halogen anions exist,408 but this field is still relatively new for colloidal nanocrystals. This new class of split-anion perovskites may broaden the selection pool of elements for designing perovskite nanocrystals by allowing higher valence cations (such as 3+ or 4+ cations instead of 2+) in the place of B-site cation (e.g., MABiSI2 or CsSnS2Cl) due to the introduction of divalent chalcogen anions.410,411
5. Applications
Owing to their outstanding optoelectronic properties, doped and ion-substituted colloidal metal halide perovskite nanocrystals show promising potential for many practical applications, including light emitting diodes (LEDs), lasing, perovskite solar cells, photodetectors, among many others.
5.1. LEDs based on doped or ion-substituted perovskite nanocrystals
Due to the excellent stability and appealing optoelectronic properties of Cs-based perovskite nanocrystals, A site doping using Cs+ is recognized as an effective strategy for improving the performance of organic–inorganic perovskite-based LEDs. Cs doped perovskite FA(1−x)CsxPbBr3 nanocrystals with specific Cs content (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) have been applied as the emissive materials for LED devices. The device structure consists of a transparent conductive indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate, a hole-transporting layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(4,4′-(N-(4-sec-butylphenyl)diphenylamine)] (TFB), a photoactive layer of FA(1−x)CsxPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals, an electron-transporting layer of 1,3,5-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi), an electron injection layer of LiF and a cathode layer of Al (Fig. 31a).42 The electroluminescence (EL) mechanism of the LED device is described as follows (Fig. 31b): electrons are injected from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of TPBi into the conduction band (CB) of perovskite nanocrystals. Holes are transferred from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of TFB into the valence band (VB) of perovskite nanocrystals, followed by radiative recombination of electron–hole pairs inside the active perovskite layer.42 Alignment of the energy levels of different components in the LED device is a key factor that significantly affects the performance of LEDs. With increasing Cs content (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3), the VB levels of FA(1−x)CsxPbBr3 gradually decreased from −5.88 eV to −5.25 eV which facilitating the hole injection due to the reduced hole injection barrier at the interface between the perovskite and the hole transport layer. The electroluminescence (EL) spectra (Fig. 31c) of the FA(1−x)CsxPbBr3-based perovskite LEDs exhibited gradual blue-shifts as a function of increasing Cs, which is consistent with the PL spectra of the corresponding nanocrystals (Fig. 5e). The inset of Fig. 31c shows a photograph of the best performance LED device based on FA0.8Cs0.2PbBr3 with a luminance of 55005 cd m−2 (Fig. 31d) and a current efficiency (CE) of 10.09 cd A−1 (Fig. 31e), exhibiting 6.4-fold and 3.6-fold improvement, respectively, over those of undoped FAPbBr3.42 Further increasing the Cs doping ratio from x = 0.2 to 0.3 did not improve device performance, indicating an optimized doping content of Cs is crucial in achieving good device performance. The excellent performance of FA0.8Cs0.2PbBr3-based LEDs may be attributed to the high crystallinity, large quantum efficiency and efficient hole injection of Cs-doped FAPbBr3. In another case of Cs-doped FAPbBr3 perovskite, colloidal FA0.8Cs0.2PbxBr3 nanocrystals with varied Pb content (x = 1.0, 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6) were fabricated forming stoichiometrically “less-lead” perovskite.43 As the x value decreased from 1.0, 0.8 to 0.7, the maximum luminance, current efficiency (CE), and external quantum efficiency (EQE) were greatly enhanced (the maximum luminance, CE, and EQE for x = 0.7 were 45440 cd m−2, 28.61 cd A−1, and 6.75%, respectively, while for x = 1.0 were 23720 cd m−2, 9.38 cd A−1, and 2.67%, respectively, Fig. 31f–h), probably due to improved hole injection resulting from the reduced hole injection barrier between the perovskite and hole transport layer. Further decreasing the Pb ratio from 0.7 to 0.6 did not further improve the device performance, indicating the best LED performance stems from the optimized Pb ratio in FA0.8Cs0.2Pb0.7Br3.43 It was suggested that the “less-lead” configuration can inhibit nonradiative recombination by diminishing the presence of uncoordinated metallic Pb atoms. It was also found that the improved stability of FA0.8Cs0.2Pb0.7Br3-based LED device can be attributed to the hydrogen-bonding interactions between the organic cation and halide anions, induced by the moderate ambient moisture.43 When Cs was doped into MAPbBr3 nanocrystals, the performance of MA1−xCsxPbBr3-based LEDs were also highly correlated with the Cs content. Notably, MA0.7Cs0.3PbBr3-based LEDs displayed a maximum luminescence of 24500 cd m−2, nearly 10-fold higher than that of previously reported MAPbBr3 nanocrystals.206 Interestingly, through doping FA into CsPbI3 nanocrystals, it is feasible to achieve stable red-emitting LED.202

B-site doped lead halide perovskite nanocrystals have also been used as the active light emitting layer of LEDs. LED devices made from 2.6 mol% Mn-doped CsPbBr3 and 3.8 mol% Mn-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals possessed improved maximum luminance of 9971 and 9717 cd m−2 under the applied voltages of 6.2 and 6.5 V, respectively. Their pure CsPbBr3 counterpart had a maximum luminance of 7493 cd m−2 under 6.6 V of applied voltage. The EQE and CE values of 2.6 mol% Mn-doped CsPbBr3 device (0.95% and 4.33 cd A−1) and 3.8 mol% Mn-doped CsPbBr3 device (1.49% and 6.40 cd A−1) also outperform the pure CsPbBr3 device (0.81% and 3.71 cd A−1).378 The EQE and CE values of LED devices made from 7.9 mol% Mn-doped CsPbI3 nanocrystals (0.51% and 0.07 cd A−1) and 21.6 mol% Mn-doped CsPbI3 nanocrystals (1.04% and 0.15 cd A−1) also outperform the pure CsPbI3 device (0.41% and 0.06 cd A−1).378 Sn2+-doped CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals have also been incorporated in LED devices. The device performance of Sn-doped CsPbBr3 LEDs was found to be closely related to the Sn doping ratio.223,226,233 The best device based on CsPb1−xSnxBr3 nanocrystals exhibited a low turn-on voltage of 3.6 V, maximum luminance of 12500 cd m−2 and EQE of 4.13%, representing the best values among Sn-doped LEDs.223,230 By varying Ni2+ and modulating Cl/Br element ratios, Ni2+-doped CsPbClxBr3−x perovskite nanocrystals with tunable emission from 508 to 432 nm were prepared via the supersaturated recrystallization method at room-temperature. As depicted in Fig. 32a, a blue-emitting LED (at 470 nm) based on 2.5% Ni2+-doped CsPbCl0.99Br2.01 was produced, and displayed a 6-fold improvement of luminance (Fig. 32b) and a 20-fold improvement of EQE (Fig. 32c) over undoped counterparts.334 Besides isovalent cation-doping, heterovalent Ce3+-doped perovskite nanocrystals have also been used in LED fabrication. While LED devices with pure CsPbBr3 nanocrystals showed a maximum CE of 12.5 cd A−1 at 4 V and EQE of 1.6% at 4.2 V, LED devices with Ce3+-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (with Ce/Pb ratio of 2.88%) displayed an enhanced maximum CE of 14.2 cd A−1 and much higher EQE of 4.4% at 3.8 V, which indicates that the nonradiative recombination has been strongly suppressed via the Ce3+-doping.302

5.2. Lasers based on doped or ion-substituted perovskite nanocrystals
Lead halide perovskites have been intensely investigated as optical gain materials for amplified spontaneous emissions (ASEs) due to their relatively low lasing thresholds and high optical gain.202,412 It is particularly challenging to obtain perovskite ASEs in the red region due to the thermodynamic instability of red-emitting iodine-containing perovskites (e.g. MAPbI3, FAPbI3, and CsPbI3).202 In iodide-based CsPbX3 (X = Br/I) nanocrystal lasing, the lasing threshold increases as the ratio of I/Br increases (i.e., red-shifted) under the same testing conditions.202 By using FAPbI3 or FA-doped CsPbI3 nanocrystals, one can observe ASEs in compact nanocrystal films deposited on glass substrates under 100 fs pulsed excitation at room temperature. ASEs appear as a narrow band with a FWHM of 10–12 nm and are 50 nm and 30 nm red-shifted from the PL maxima of FAPbI3 and FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 nanocrystals, respectively (Fig. 33a and b). A lasing threshold of 7.5 μJ cm−2, one of the lowest values among red-to-NIR emitting perovskites, was achieved by 100 nm compact films of FAPbI3 nanocrystals with smooth mirror-like surfaces, obtained by repetitive dip-coatings and 90 °C annealing (Fig. 33a). A lasing threshold of 28 μJ cm−2 was achieved by films of FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 nanocrystals obtained by drop-casting and drying at 50 °C (Fig. 33b). It was found that perovskite nanocrystal films exhibited lower lasing thresholds when films were prepared under processing conditions that favored the sintering of perovskite nanocrystals (e.g., ligand desorption by repetitive washing steps and/or annealing the films at a higher temperature of 90–100 °C).202 Lasing from single crystal perovskite nanowires with tunable wavelength have also been studied by controlling the stoichiometry of both cations and anions. MAPbBryI3−y and MAPbClxBr3−x single crystal nanowires were synthesized by mixing different stoichiometry of iodide and bromide or bromide and chloride precursors, and the corresponding lasing emission coverd from 500 to 790 nm (Fig. 33c).23 Single-crystal MAPbX3 perovskite nanowires exhibit lasing quantum yields approaching 100% with the lowest lasing thresholds (220 nJ cm−2) and highest quality factors (Q factors ∼3600) yet reported for nanowire lasers.23 Cation alloying (FA,MA)PbI3 and cation/halide double alloying (FA,MA)Pb(Br,I)3 single-crystal nanowires can fill the lasing gap between 580 and 670 nm which cannot be realized by MA-based perovskite nanowires and can further extend the lasing wavelength all the way to 824 nm NIR region (the wavelengths highlighted in the dashed rectangular boxes in Fig. 33c).24 The violet-blue wavelength region (420–490 nm) can be satisfied with wide band gap CsPb(Br,Cl)3 nanowires (Fig. 33d).22 Compared with MA-based lasers, single crystal FAPbX3 nanowire lasers feature red-shifted emission and better thermal stability.24 Recently, continuous wave (CW) lasers were fabricated from non-stoichiometric Cs, MA and FA mixed cations perovskite thin films,413 which is worth further studying in nanocrystals form. In addition, single-mode lasers based on CsPbX3 submicron spheres are other interesting devices that merit further investigation.414

5.3. Solar cells based on doped or ion-substituted perovskite nanocrystals
Perovskite solar cells have witnessed a rapid increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term stability over the past decade.415 Doping with different cations in the A-site and incorporating different halides in the X-site have been regarded as feasible strategies for substantially enhancing the stability and PCE of film-based perovskite solar cells.416 Doped perovskite nanocrystals have also been extensively studied in photovoltaic applications. Though Sn-based perovskite solar cells are unstable due to easy oxidation, alloyed CsSn1−xPbxI3 nanocrystals possess far superior phase-stability to both parent CsSnI3 and CsPbI3 nanocrystals (degradation over months, not days).10 Photoexcited electrons from alloyed CsSn1−xPbxI3 nanocrystals can be injected into TiO2 at a fast rate of 1.12 × 1011 s−1, which may facilitate high photocurrent generation when applied in solar cells. As a proof of concept, alloyed CsSn1−xPbxI3 nanocrystals have been employed as the sensitizer in a quantum dot-sensitized solar cell (QDSC) configuration, with the use of liquid-state iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) electrolyte. The device delivered a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 10.13 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.63 V, fill factor (FF) of 0.46, and an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.9%.10 CsSnI2.95F0.05 with and without SnF2 doping have been used to replace the liquid-state iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) electrolyte in the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and serves as the hole conduction layer to realize a novel all-solid-state photovoltaic cell structure.242 CsSnX3 quantum rods synthesized by solvothermal process have also been used as the absorbing layer to fabricate solar cells, and those devices reached power conversion efficiencies of 9.66%, 10.46%, and 12.96% from CsSnCl3, CsSnBr3, and CsSnI3 devices, respectively.235
Solar cells based on colloidal perovskite nanocrystals generally have the following structure: a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrate (e.g., indium tin oxide (ITO) or fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO))/electron transport layer (ETL) (e.g., TiO2 or SnO2)/perovskite active layer/hole transport layer (HTL) (generally spiro-OMeTAD)/metal contact electrode (e.g., Au or Al).8,9 When employing colloidal quantum dots or nanocrystals in solar cell devices, the insulating ligands on the surface of colloidal nanocrystals are considered to be a major limiting factor. Due to the ionic nature of perovskite nanocrystals, the polarity of the antisolvent used for nanocrystal surface treatment needs to be deliberately chosen in order to remove the surface ligands without damaging the integrity of the nanocrystals. Water, methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol are classified as “grade I” solvents that can completely destroy the ionic bonds in FAPbI3 nanocrystals; t-butanol, 2-pentanol, acetonitrile/toluene (v:v 2:3), and ethyl acetate are classified as “grade II” solvents that can gradually remove the surface ligands without destroying the integrity of FAPbI3 nanocrystals; and chlorobenzene, toluene, octane, and hexane are classified as “grade III” solvents that are not able to remove the surface ligands on FAPbI3 nanocrystals.9 Therefore, a photovoltaic device using FAPbI3 colloidal quantum dots (CQD) as a photoactive layer (Fig. 34a) was fabricated by employing a set of three different “grade II” solvents with gradually reducing polarity, and the ligand density can be sequentially decreased while maintaining the integrity of FAPbI3 nanocrystals. The Jsc, Voc, and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the FAPbI3 CQD-based solar cell gradually increased after each surface treatment cycle due to the progressive removal of insulating surface ligands (Fig. 34b and c).9 A maximum PCE of 8.38% was achieved with a Jsc, of 11.84 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.10 V and a FF of 0.64. It is worth noting that the high defect tolerance of perovskite materials accounts for the large Voc of FAPbI3 CQD-based solar cells, which in turn leads to favorable carrier transport.

In addition to removing the surface ligands using polarity controlled antisolvents, one can also boost solar cell performance by post-treatment with an A-site cation halide salt (AX, where A = formamidinium (FA+), methylammonium (MA+), or cesium (Cs+) and X = I− or Br−).8 Postsynthetic addition of A-site cation halide salts (AX) (such as formamidinium iodide (FAI)) has been shown to improve the coupling between nanocrystals, passivate the surface, tune the device energetics, and improve stability of perovskite solar cells. A perovskite solar cell was fabricated by sequentially deposited CsPbI3 nanocrystal film via a spin coating method. The film was immersed in a saturated lead(II) nitrate [Pb(NO3)2] solution in methyl acetate (MeOAc) after each coating to partially remove the native ligands and allow for further layers to be deposited without re-dispersing the existing layers. After three to four deposition cycles, a CsPbI3 nanocrystal film with a thickness of 200 to 400 nm was built and then immersed in a saturated AX salt solution in ethyl acetate (EtOAc) for ∼10 s to yield AX coated CsPbI3 active layer (Fig. 34d). The highest PCE of 13.4% was obtained by FAI treatment with a Jsc of 14.37 mA cm−2, which was significant higher than that of treatment in pure EtOAc (9.22 mA cm−2). Notably, other AX salt (i.e., FABr, MAI, MABr, CsI) treatments also displayed improved Jsc over the control sample (i.e., pure EtOAc treatment) (Fig. 34e). However, all AX salt treatments displayed little impact on the Voc (1.17–1.22), FF (0.78–0.82), and EQE onset (∼700 nm) (Fig. 34f), indicating the improvement of PCE is largely attributed to the increased Jsc. The possible reason for the increased Jsc was found to be related to the higher charge carrier collection efficiency in the CsPbI3 quantum dot films after post-treatment by AX salts.8 Despite the fact that solar cells made from FAI-coated CsPbI3 nanocrystals outperformed neat CsPbI3 nanocrystals in the abovementioned study, the devices fabricated from Cs1−xFAxPbI3 mixed A-site perovskite nanocrystals did not perform better than those made with CsPbI3 nanocrystals.417 Notably, surface passivation seems to play a more important role than alloying in nanocrystals-based perovskite solar cells. For instance, solar cells based on CsPbI3 nanocrystals with a GeI2 additive showed better stability than the ones without GeI2, which was believed to be due to the efficient surface passivation of the quantum dots upon the addition of GeI2.418 It is notable that the best performance research cells reported by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)49 are all mixed perovskite cells, either employing mixed cations or mixed anions. This is likely because light absorbing films grown under iodine-rich conditions are prone to a high density of deep electronic traps, which act as recombination centers. Thus the use of bromide or chloride precursors mitigate or suppress the formation of these key defects.144 It is important to note that although the PCEs attained from nanocrystal-based perovskite solar cells have not exceeded those of film-based cells due to the insulating ligands that results in the lower Jsc, the Voc accessed by nanocrystal-based devices possesses a lower Voc loss than film-based cells and is closer to the theoretical thermodynamic limit of single-junction cells based on the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) analysis.417
5.4. Energy down-conversion coatings based on doped or ion-substituted perovskite nanocrystals
In addition, doped perovskite nanoscrystals can also be utilized as energy converting coating. For example, Mn-doped CsPbCl3 (or CsPbCl3:Mn) nanocrystals were used as energy down-converters to change the normally un-harvestable ultraviolet (UV) radiation (wavelengths 300–400 nm) into harvestable visible light.67 CsPbCl3:0.1Mn (meaning 10% Mn substitution) nanocrystals were synthesized via a hot-injection method by swiftly injecting Cs–oleate precursor into a mixture of PbCl2 and MnCl2. These CsPbCl3:0.1Mn nanocrystals displayed a large Stokes shift (>200 nm) and had yellow emission centered at ∼590 nm. The Stokes shift can be explained by the energy transferred from the conduction band (CB) of CsPbCl3 host to Mn2+ ions via4T1–6A1 transition.67 Different concentrations of CsPbCl3:0.1Mn nanocrystal solutions were spin-coated onto the transparent side of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells (Fig. 35a), and it was found that devices with the optimized concentration of 5 mg mL−1 saw a 3.34% improvement in PCE (increased from 17.97% to 18.57%) (Fig. 35b). Devices coated with CsPbCl3:0.1Mn nanocrystal also showed enhanced stability, illustrated by their 97% retention of initial PCE after 100 h of continuous UV LED irradiation while the PCE for devices without coating dropped to 85% of its initial efficiency (Fig. 35c). It is possible that the energy-down-converting CsPbCl3:0.1Mn coating can reduce the UV-induced degradation and therefore improve the device stability.67 Similar down-converting coating strategies have also been applied in photodetectors. The UV response of photodetectors can be markedly enhanced by depositing a layer of colloidal CsPbX3 perovskite nanocrystals on the surface and tuning the PL emission wavelength via the halide composition to fall within the maximal EQE response region of the detector.16

5.5. Color conversion coatings based on doped or ion-substituted perovskite nanocrystals
Similar to the above application as energy down-converters from UV to visible light, perovskite nanocrystals can also be used as down-conversion luminescent phosphors by down converting light from blue LED chips into different visible light (green, yellow, orange, or red) to obtain desired color temperature white lights for lighting or display applications.68–71 Green emitting Cs0.1FA0.9PbBr3 and red emitting Cs0.1FA0.9PbBr1.5I1.5 mixed-cation perovskite nanocrystals–PMMA polymer composite films have been used as color converters on a blue LED chip to achieve white light LED.419 Likewise, a bright pure white light-emitting device (WLED), with corresponding CIE color coordinate (0.31, 0.34) (note that pure white light is (0.33, 0.33)), was assembled by stacking a 10% Mn-doped CsPbCl3/PMMA composite film as an orange-red emitting layer, a CsPbBr3/PMMA composite film as a green-emitting layer, and a CsPbCl1.5 Br1.5/PMMA composite film as a blue-emitting layer on top of a 396 nm UV LED chip (Fig. 36).420 The orange-red emission from the Mn-doped perovskite nanocrystals can be used as color conversion coatings by mixing dual emission Mn-doped CsPbCl3 or Mn-doped CsPb(Cl/Br)3 nanocrystals with polymer and depositing these polymer–nanocrystals composites on the surface of blue LED chips.257,261 In order to achieve the desired color temperature from these dual emission Mn-doped nanocrystals, sometimes it is crucial to fine tune the host perovskite emission peak position (by tuning the ratio of Cl/Br content) as well as the relative peak intensity ratio between the host perovskite emission and the dopant Mn emission. This complex design is sometimes difficult to achieve during the synthesis process and may need to be further fine-tuned through postsynthetic processes. By utilizing the distinct exchange rates of the cation (slow) and anion (fast) and control (terminate) the ion exchange by purification at different reaction times, one can easily obtain the desired color temperature from these Mn-doped CsPb(Cl/Br)3 nanocrystals.421 For lighting or display applications it is beneficial to choose a phosphor material that has a larger Stokes shift (which means there is a significant difference between the absorption and emission peak) to minimize the potential for self-absorption. MA3Bi2X9 and Cs3Bi2X9 systems both show a slightly larger Stokes shift, which makes them prime candidates for lighting applications.355

There are many other applications that have capitalized on either colloidal perovskite nanocrystals or doped perovskite nanocrystals, such as CsPbI3-based photodiodes,12 Cs2SnI6 and Ag-doped CsPbBr3-based FETs,237,326 CsPbCl3/graphene and FAxMA1−xPbI3/MoOx FET heterojunction photodetectors,18,422 CsPbX3-based X-ray detection scintillators,75 Yb3+-doped CsPbCl3 luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs),307,308 chemical probes for TNP, TOAX, or HCl detections,72–74 hydrogen (H2) generation,76 photocatalytic CO2 reduction,77–83 fluorescent inks for anti-counterfeit/encryption printing purposes,84–86 and luminescence probes for bioimaging applications.87
6. Summary and outlooks
This review summarized the general background of perovskite nanocrystals, discussed the fundamentals of doping and ion substitution in the A-, B-, and X-site of ABX3 type 3D perovskite nanocrystals, examined their stability, and outlined their applications. Particularly, various dopants and doping strategies have been discussed as summarized as follows: first, for A-site doping, Cs, MA, and FA are the three commonly used cations that can sustain stable 3D perovskite structure. The size and optical properties of MA lie in between those of FA and Cs cations. Introducing smaller Cs cations contracts the lattice and reduces the cubo-octahedral volume, thereby inducing stronger interaction between the cations and halides which increases (i.e. blue-shifts) the band gap, and in turn facilitates the formation of highly crystalline perovskite crystals at a low temperature. In contrast, incorporating larger FA cations causes lattice expansion, achieves a tolerance factor closer to 1, and forms hydrogen bonds which stabilize the pseudocubic structure, thus resulting in superior solar cell performance due to red-shifted absorption (i.e., reduced band gap) and improved charge transport. Moreover, Rb and Tl have also been used for A-site doping and exhibited a relatively lower PLQY. Second, for B-site doping, partial substitution of Pb2+ with a smaller B-site cations reduces the B–X bond length and stabilizes the lead iodide perovskite by reducing the extent of octahedral rotation or distortion, leading to: a larger tolerance factor (improved phase stability), a larger formation energy (improved thermal stability), and reducing the toxic lead content at the same time. Sn2+-containing perovskite nanocrystals display relatively red-shifted optical properties (compared with their Pb-based counterparts) due to higher Pauling electronegativity for Sn2+ than Pb2+ ions. However, Sn2+ easily oxidizes to Sn4+ causing their persistent instability. Intriguingly, Mn-doping and lanthanide-doping both demonstrate multi-peak emission with PL peaks related to transitions from energy levels of the dopant ions. Depending on the dopant levels, Mn2+-doped perovskites possess a dopant PL at ∼600 nm while Yb3+-doped perovskites show a dopant PL at ∼1000 nm with PLQY exceeding 100% due to the quantum-cutting effect. Notably, metal(II) halide salts (MX2) have been commonly employed for isovalent substitutions such as doping alkaline-earth metals and transition metals, and have various impacts based on the size of the metal ions. Furthermore, heterovalent substitutions also exert very different influences, depending on the ion used, and occasionally may produce structures other than ABX3 (e.g., A3B2X9 or A2B′B′′X6) in order to satisfy charge neutrality. Finally, for X-site doping, halide substitution has been widely exploited for tailoring the band gap of perovskite nanocrystals as it can readily change the optical responses throughout the whole visible range (∼300 nm); this contrasts greatly the range that can be tuned via the quantum confinement effect (only roughly 100 nm). In particular, the incorporation of Cl− or I− anions blue-shifts or red-shifts the optical properties of Br−-based perovskite nanocrystals, respectively. It is also noteworthy that SCN−-doped and chalcohalide split-anion perovskites have been investigated in thin film solar cells yet are relatively new for colloidal nanocrystals.
Doping and ion substitution has been shown to alter the optical properties of perovskite nanocrystals, improve their stability, and reduce their toxic lead content. The extremely high PLQY, ease of synthesis, and the potential of roll-to-roll printing or low temperature solution mass production of perovskite nanocrystals render them as promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronic devices. Nonetheless, for commercialization of perovskite nanocrystals-based materials and devices, a few issues merit further investigation and improvement. The major challenges facing perovskite nanocrystals include: increasing stability,423 broadening the band gap (i.e., extension of absorption from visible to UV and NIR), eliminating toxic lead content,424 minimizing phase segregation (ion migration and hysteresis),194,425 and reducing self-absorption (i.e., increasing Stokes shift).426,427 Peculiarly, the stability remains a key issue among all challenges, including colloidal stability, color stability, structural stability, phase stability, photo (UV) stability, thermal stability, as well as moisture and air stability.428 Generally, the stability of colloidal perovskite nanocrystals could be largely raised by the following strategies: (1) deliberate selection of low polarity solvent/anti-solvent and stronger binding ligands to minimize the detachment of ligands and reduce the number of surface defects.429 (2) Encapsulation via creating core–shell (or core/shell 1/shell 2) structures or impregnating in water resistant organic or inorganic matrix to prevent direct contact with the surrounding environment and passivate surface defect sites.430 (3) Intrinsic structural engineering (e.g. compositional tuning, double perovskite, or other low-dimensional structures) to tailor the tolerance factor and thus enhance the formation energy. The desorption of surface ligands during washing is recognized as one of the main causes for the instability in colloidal perovskite nanocrystals. Stronger binding ligands such as multidentate ligands (e.g., compounds with concurrent polyamine and polyacid functional groups),431 pre-formed alkylammonium halide salts,432,433 or ligated star-like polymer nanoreactors99,100 represent promising research directions for enhanced stability.434 Seeking alternative solvents that do not require the removal of solvent prior to employing nanocrystals for applications may stand out as the other possible research effort to avoid ligand detachment.435
We note that the general research endeavors towards mixed-cation/anion colloidal metal halide perovskite nanocrystals practically follow that of thin film perovskites, including multi-site ion substitutions (i.e., simultaneous substitution of A-site & B-site ions, e.g., (FA/Cs)(Pb/Sn)X3436 and (MA/FA)(Pb/Sn)X3;437,438 A-site & X-site ions, e.g., (FA/Cs)Pb(I/Br)3203,204,439 and (FA/MA)Pb(I/Br)3;201,440–442 or B-site & X-site ions, e.g., MA(Pb/Sn)(I/Br)3443 and MA(Pb/Sn)(I/Cl)3444), and can be further expanded to concurrent substitution of all three sites (A-site, B-site, and X-site) such as (FA/MA)(Pb/Zn)(I/Br)3.445 Triple-cation perovskite (e.g., (Cs/MA/FA)PbX3446–448 and (K/MA/FA)PbX3449) and quadruple-cation perovskite (e.g., (Rb/Cs/MA/FA)PbX3156,447,448 and (K/Cs/MA/FA)PbX3450) have already been widely studied in thin film solar cells to improve device performance, enhance thermal stability, and reduce hysteresis. Nonetheless, to date no colloidal perovskite nanocrystals based on triple- or quadruple-cation have been synthesized. Exotic A-site cations C4H9NH3+ (n-butylammonium, BA),451 (CH2)3NH2+ (azetidinium, Az),452 C2H4(NH3)22+ (ethylenediamine, EDA2+),453 C(NH2)3+ (guanidinium, Gua),454 C6H13NH3+ (n-hexylammonium, HA),455 C8H9NH3+ (phenylethylammonium, PEA),456 thiourea (TU),457 and aromatic derivatives (R–NH3+, where R is naphthalene, fluorine, anthracene, pyrene, or perylene)458–460) have been exercised in mixed-cation perovskite thin film solar cells. However, the synthesis in the form of perovskite nanocrystals containing these A-site cations noted above has not yet been explored. This represents an important area and can be pursued. It is worth noting that the incorporation of some of these complex yet bigger organic cations may induce low-dimensional (quasi-2D layered, 2D, 1D, and 0D) structures instead of 3D structure.
On the other hand, the concrete mechanisms of doping and ion substitution remain elusive and merits more thorough investigation. For example, it is challenging to pinpoint the exact location or distribution of the dopant within the host matrix. To this end, it invokes a combination of several different techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, and high-resolution synchrotron XRD, in conjunction with the first-principles calculations to clarify the underlying doping mechanism.328 The ability to scrutinize the actual position of dopant ions in the lattice is the key to derive accurate conclusions. For example, when adding metal halide salts (e.g., SbCl3, BiCl3, VCl3, NiCl2, ZnCl2, SnCl2, SnCl4, PbCl2, and CuCl) as dopants to CsPbCl3 nanocrystals, the difference in the PLQY enhancements are not due to the doping of these dissimilar metal ions, yet because of the varied ability of these metal salts to release active chloride ions for surface passivation, as proven by control experiments with metal acetate salts showing no increase in the PLQY.433
Investigation into the PL decay kinetics is also of key importance in determining how surface defects, functioning as recombination centers, affect the PLQY of perovskite nanocrystals. For instance, a biexponential PL decay transforming to a monoexponential decay signifies the efficient passivation of surface defects.327,461 Transient absorption, time-resolved PL, and time-resolved fluorescence quenching spectroscopies represent some robust techniques to explore the energy transfer process in perovskite nanocrystals, including examining the exciton diffusion length and probing the energy transfer rate between neighboring nanocrystals. Nonetheless, these are critical measurements to identify whether these nanocrystals are suitable to be utilized in certain applications.462 Such fundamental studies may also be beneficial for improving the PLQY of Cl-based and lead-free perovskite nanocrystals as they possess low PLQY.335 The ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of perovskite nanocrystals and their corresponding applications may also be worth further study.463
Colloidal nanocrystals afford many unique tunable physical properties rendered by the control over their size, shape, architecture (e.g., core–shell structure, Janus structure, nanowire/nanorod, etc.), and surface capping ligands. Clearly, advanced architecture engineering integrated with composition tailoring may constitute a future research direction. For example, some interesting future exploration may involve doping one material in the core and doping the other material in the shell in core/shell nanocrystals464 or doping two dissimilar materials of interest in the respective half of a Janus nanostructures (e.g., Janus nanoparticles and nanorods) to yield interesting polarized optic or catalytic effects.465 In addition to fine tuning the doping condition to improve the doping efficiency, the ability to capitalize on doping and ion substitution to alter the optoelectronic properties, enhance the stability, and reduce the toxicity of colloidal metal halide perovskite nanocrystals makes them very appealing for broadened use in many future applications. For instance, due to the ease of wavelength tuning and near unity PLQY, perovskite nanocrystals are ideal candidates as luminescence probes for bioimaging.87–94 Unfortunately, only toxic lead-containing perovskite nanocrystals are found to possess a sufficiently high PLQY, with safer lead-free perovskite nanocrystals usually displaying a relatively low PLQY. Doped or ion-substituted perovskite nanocrystals with lower cytotoxicity yet retaining high PLQY may stand out as outstanding alternatives for use in bioimaging when they are well-encapsulated within water-resistance matrix.

 	Fig. 14  The evolution of the energy level diagram of Mn-doped CsPbX3 (Mn:CsPbX3) nanocrystals during forward and reverse anion exchange. CB and VB denote the conduction and the valence band of the nanocrystal, respectively. The relative intensities of the two PL features of Mn:CsPbX3 nanocrystals are established by the interplay of rates of several competing processes including: band edge electron–hole recombination (keh), deactivation of the Mn2+-based d–d transition (kMn), and forward (kET) and back (kBET) energy transfer between the nanocrystal and the impurity. The competition between the latter two processes is also strongly influenced by the energy difference (Δ) between the band edge and Mn2+-based transitions. (top panel) The Δ in freshly prepared Mn:CsPbCl3 nanocrystals is large and positive, favoring forward energy transfer and strong Mn2+-based PL (yellow shading spectrum labeled as before in the top right box). After anion exchange with PbBr2, (bottom right panel) the Δ in resulting Mn:CsPbBr3 nanocrystals is still positive but much smaller; and some Mn2+ is lost to ion exchange with Pb2+. Both effects lead to reduced Mn2+-based PL (orange shading spectrum in the bottom right box; amplitude multiplied by a factor of 10). After further exchange with PbI2, (bottom left panel) the Δ in the obtained Mn:CsPbI3 nanocrystals is negative, resulting in no Mn2+-based PL (bottom left box). Finally, reverse anion exchange by sequentially exchanging Mn:CsPbI3 with PbBr2 then PbCl2 returns nanocrystals from Mn:CsPbI3 to Mn:CsPbBr3 then Mn:CsPbCl3 (top panel), restoring a large and positive Δ, leading to the re-emergence of Mn2+-based PL. Note that the intensity of the Mn2+-based PL is much smaller compared to the freshly prepared samples (orange shading labeled as After in the top right box), due to the loss of Mn2+ when Pb-containing exchange precursors are used.

 	Fig. 21  Schematic representation of the proposed cation exchange reaction mechanism. In the first step, surface halide vacancies are created by oleylamine (OLAM) molecules in solution. In the second step, a Br anion of an OLAM–MBr2 unit occupies the halide vacancy. In a third step, the bound OLAM molecule extract a PbBr2 unit, leaving a cation and halide vacancy behind, which are occupied by the bound MBr2 species. Finally, the incorporated divalent guest cation diffuses into the perovskite lattice, leaving behind a halide vacancy at the surface for a second cation exchange process to occur.
