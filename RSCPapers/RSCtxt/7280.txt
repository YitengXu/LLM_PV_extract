    , Accepted 7th September 2011First published on 19th September 2011AbstractA novel composite photoanode with ZnO nanowire arrays coating on the top of TiO2 nanoparticles is fabricated, and an efficiency of 4.52% is achieved for the composite cell, far higher than both 0.90% of the ZnO nanowire cell and 3.56% of the TiO2 nanoparticle cell. The improved efficiency is resulted from the high surface area of nanoparticles, as well as fast electron transport and light scattering effect of nanowires.

Dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has attracted extensive attention as a potential alternative to the conventional silicon cell because of its low cost, high conversion efficiency, good stability and simple preparation procedure.1 The sandwich configuration of a DSSC typically consists of a dye-adsorbed porous network as a photoanode, an electrolyte containing I−/I3−redox couples and a Pt counter electrode. The photoanode is the recipient of injected electrons from photo-excited dye molecules and provides the conductive pathway from the site of electron injection to the transparent back contact, and thus is the key parameter that determines the power conversion efficiency. Since first reported by Grätzel in 1991,1 porous TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) film is widely investigated as a photoanode architecture, and a record respective efficiency of 11.3% has been achieved.2 The electron transport through the random NP porous film is via a random walk with multiple trapping and detrapping events,3 which seriously limits the electron diffusion coefficient and the electron collection time. Therefore, further efficiency enhancement in porous TiO2 NP DSSC is difficult for slow electron percolation through the randomly associated NPs and energy loss due to recombination.
During the past years, many efforts have been made to optimize the morphology of the nanostructured photoanode. Among various photoanode morphologies, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure is expected to be a promising substitute to porous NP films for providing direct transport channels to facilitate electron transport and collection.4ZnO, which possesses similar energy band structure and physical properties with TiO2, exhibits a ∼4 times higher electron mobility and easier preparation procedure of 1D nanostructures than that of TiO2.4 Thus, it is expected that 1D ZnO nanostructures as photoanodes would enhance the electron transport rate and lead to a high DSSC efficiency. However, the efficiency of such a DSSC has been kept at a relatively low level up to now, much lower than the maximum reported 11.3% for TiO2 NPs, due to the insufficient surface area for dye absorption.4
Hence, to further improve the DSSC efficiency, a large surface area is needed for sufficient dye absorption, at the same time, a fast electron conduction pathway is desired for efficient transport of the photo-excited electron from dye molecules to the collector. To satisfy these requirements, TiO2 nanoparticle/nanowire (NP/NW),5TiO2 nanoparticle/nanotube (NP/NT),6 and ZnO NP/NW7 composite photoanodes have been used to fabricate DSSCs, and encouraging improvement of cell performance has been demonstrated. However, most of the studies made on NP/NW photoanodes using NPs as the core–shell of the NWs.5–7 In this communication, we propose a novel photoanode structure with ZnO NW arrays coated on the top of porous TiO2 NP films (denoted as TiO2 NP/ZnO NW) to improve the cell performance. A similar photoanode structure has also been reported by Chao et al., but a low efficiency of 2.16% was obtained.8 In our work, a 4.52% efficiency is achieved for the TiO2 NP/ZnO NW DSSC, which is about 5 times higher than that of the ZnO NW cell (0.90%) and 1.3 times larger than that of the TiO2 NP cell (3.56%).
The TiO2 NP/ZnO NW photoanode was fabricated by a three-step method. Firstly, the TiO2 NP film was synthesized directly onto the FTO substrate via a screen printing technique, similar to the well-known Doctor Blade method.1 Then a ZnO seed layer was deposited on the TiO2 film through a sputtering process.9 Finally, ZnO NW arrays were grown on the seeded TiO2 film by a hydrothermal method. The basic structure of the TiO2 NP/ZnO NW DSSC is depicted in Fig. 1 and the possible advantages of the composite photoanode are listed below. On one hand, under light irradiation, photo-generated electrons are rapidly transferred through the ZnO NWs to the TiO2 NP film and to the FTO substrate, which would enhance the electron transport rate and reduce combinations. Additionally, the ZnO NWs on the top of NPs could serve as a scattering layer to enhance the light harvesting. On the other hand, the TiO2 NP film in the composite photoanode would provide a large surface area for enough dye absorption. Therefore, it is expected that the composite photoanode combines both the advantages of NWs and NPs, and would lead to an improved efficiency. The experimental details of photoanode fabrication, cell assembly and characterization were reported in the ESI.†

The morphologies of ZnO NW, TiO2 NP and TiO2 NP/ZnO NW films were examined using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). As shown in Fig. S1 (see ESI†), it is clear that the ZnO NWs with diameter in the range of 80–120 nm and length of about 5 μm vertically grown on the seeded FTO substrate, and a porous TiO2 NP film with a thickness of ∼12.5 m directly formed on the FTO substrate. In our work, the thickness of the TiO2 film can be controlled by adjusting the screen printing parameters, and a printing rate of ∼2.5 μm per layer was obtained when prepared under identical conditions. Fig. 2a, b and c shows the cross-sectional SEM images of the as-prepared TiO2 NP/ZnO NW photoanode with TiO2 film thicknesses of ∼2.5 μm, 5 μm and 7.5 μm, respectively, suggesting that the NW arrays with a length of ∼5 μm are always perpendicularly grown on the surface of the seeded TiO2 film tightly, regardless of the TiO2 film thickness. Closer observation of the interface in the TiO2 NP/ZnO NW film is shown in Fig. 2d, confirming the close contact of the TiO2 film, ZnO seed layer and ZnO NWs, which is helpful for the electron transport and successful operation of a DSSC. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and selected-area electron-diffraction (SAED) patterns indicate that the ZnO NWs are of single crystalline wurtzite structure, facilitating electron transport. The HRTEM pattern of the NPs (shown in Fig. S2, ESI†) suggests that the NPs are with an average diameter of 10 nm, and the crystallinity of the NPs is anatase, which is consistent with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results. The XRD patterns confirm the anatase and wurtzite structures of TiO2 NP and ZnO NWs (see Fig. S3, ESI†).

For fair comparison, a series of experiments with various TiO2 film thicknesses before and after ZnO NWs coating have been conducted, and their current–voltage (J–V) characteristics have been measured. By comparing the J–V curves of DSSCs with NP and TiO2 NP/ZnO NW photoanode with the same film thickness of 7.5 μm, 10 μm, and 12.5 μm, it is clear that, irrespective of the film thickness, the TiO2 NP/ZnO NW DSSC always exhibits better cell performance than those of NW and NP DSSCs. Details of experimental data are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S4) and the J–V curves of DSSCs with NP and TiO2 NP/ZnO NW film thickness of 7.5 μm and 10 μm are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). In this communication, we focus on the explanation of the improved performance of cell with a film thickness of 12.5 μm, as shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Table 1, for the TiO2 NP/ZnO NW cell the short-current photocurrent (Jsc) is 11.77 mA cm−2, remarkably higher than 2.80 mA cm−2 of the ZnO NW cell and higher than 9.37 mA cm−2 of the TiO2 NP cell. The higher Jsc of the TiO2 NP/ZnO NW cell than that of the NW cell is due to the increased surface area from the TiO2 NP film, which can be confirmed by the higher dye absorption from 0.83 to 2.53 × 10−7 mol cm−2. The amount of absorbed dye was determined by a spectroscopic method by measuring the concentration of the dye desorbed from the photoanode surface in a mixed solution of 0.1 M NaOH and ethanol (1:1 volume fraction), and the values are listed in Table 1. When compared with the NP cell (2.62 × 10−7 mol cm−2), the TiO2 NP/ZnO NW cell has a relatively low dye absorption (2.53 × 10−7 mol cm−2), but its Jsc is superior. To make clear the reason for the improved Jsc, reflectance and absorption spectra of these films were measured. Fig. S6a (ESI†) shows the reflectance spectra of the dye-free TiO2 NP/ZnO NW and TiO2 NP films, indicating that the composite film has better light-scattering ability than that of the TiO2 NP film. Besides, by comparing the absorption spectra of dye-sensitized TiO2 NP/ZnO NW and TiO2 NP films (Fig. S6b, ESI†), it is seen that, even though the amount of absorbed dyes in the composite photoanode is lower, it also exhibits stronger absorption in the visible region than that of the TiO2 NP film. Accordingly, we speculate that the ZnO NWs on the top of NPs may serve as a scattering layer, and the enhanced Jsc is mainly ascribed to the light scattering effect of the ZnO NWs.

Additionally, for the ZnO NW cell the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) is 588 mV, for the TiO2 NP cell it is 676 mV, while for the TiO2 NP/ZnO NW composite cell it is 698 mV. The higher Voc of the composite cell than that of the NW cell is due to the more dye absorption and thus more photo-generated electrons; and the higher Voc than that of the NP cell is mainly ascribed to the fast electron transport and thus reduced recombination.4 The Voc value of a DSSC is determined by the difference between the Fermi level for electrons in the photoanode and the redox potential of I−/I3−.1 Therefore, both the increased photo-generated electrons and reduced electron recombination lead to an increase of electron density in the TiO2 NP/ZnO NW surface, and thus the higher shift of Fermi level and increased Voc.
These suggestions can be confirmed by the smaller dark photocurrent and lower recombination rate (kr) of the TiO2 NP/ZnO NW cell than those of the NP cell. The dark J–V curves of TiO2 NP/ZnO NW and NP cells are shown in Fig. 4a, the TiO2 NP/ZnO NW cell shows a larger open-voltage and a smaller dark photocurrent, confirming the reduced electron recombination in the composite cell.9Fig. 4b compares the relationship of kr to Voc of TiO2 NP/ZnO NW and NP cells, the mathematical relation between kr and Voc is obtained by linear fitting of the experimental data and can be expressed as lg(kr) = −3.27 + 8.56 Voc and lg(kr) = −3.67 + 8.55 Voc, respectively, and thus the kr is measured to be 198 s−1 for the TiO2 NP/ZnO NW cell and 326 s−1 for the NP cell. The lower kr of the TiO2 NP/ZnO NW cell also indicates successful suppression of surface recombination by providing a direct electron conduction pathway along ZnO NWs.10

In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the TiO2 NPs in the TiO2 NP/ZnO NW composite photoanode offer a large surface area for enough dye absorption, and the ZnO NWs on the top of the TiO2 NP film provide direct channels for fast electron transport and also serve as a scattering layer for enhanced light harvesting. All of the advantages of the composite photoanode lead to notable increased Jsc and Voc, and thus a remarkable improved efficiency of 4.52%, which is about 5 times higher than that of the ZnO NW cell and 1.3 times larger than that of the TiO2 NP cell.
