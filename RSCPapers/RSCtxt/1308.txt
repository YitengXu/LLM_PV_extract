    , Accepted 1st September 2021First published on 1st September 2021AbstractLiquid-exfoliated 2D transition metal disulfides (TMDs) are potential substitutes for poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as hole transport layers (HTLs) in Organic Solar Cells (OSCs). Herein, high-yield and high-quality WS2 flake layers are prepared by comprehensively controlling the initial concentration, sonication processing time and centrifugal speed. The WS2 layers deposited on in situ transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) without plasma treatment show higher uniformity and conductivity than that formed on ITO after plasma treatment. With a significant increase in the short-circuit current density (JSC), the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PM6:Y6-based non-fullerene OSCs using optimized WS2 as the HTL is higher than that using PEDOT:PSS as the HTL(15.75% vs. 15.31%). Combining the morphology characteristics with carrier recombination characteristics, the higher quality of the ITO/WS2 composite substrate leads to better charge transport and a lower bimolecular recombination rate in OSCs, thereby improving the device performance.
Introduction
A promising option to solve the fossil energy crisis and environmental pollution is to develop photovoltaic technology that directly uses solar energy to generate electricity. Due to the unique advantages of large-scale manufacturing through roll-to-roll printing processes, mechanical flexibility, translucency, and diverse applications, OSCs have attracted great interest in both academia and industry in the past few decades.1,2 The PCE of organic solar cells has rapidly increased to over 18% recently.3–8 The great improvement of device performance is attributed to both the development of new materials and great achievements in device engineering.9–14 The interfacial engineering between the active layer and the electrodes is one of the useful and feasible ways to improve carrier transport and extraction, thereby achieving high performances in OSCs.15–19 There are numerous effective choices such as polyelectrolytes,20 metal oxides (ZnO),21 metal salts (LiF),22 composite interface materials,23,24etc. for electron-transport layers (ETLs) which modify the surface properties of the cathode. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been widely used as an HTL in OSCs due to its advantages including good electrochemical/thermal stability, excellent optical transparency and high quality film formation.25–27 However, the high hygroscopicity and acidity of PEDOT:PSS led to the degradation of ITO as well as affect the conductivity and work function (WF) of the electrode.28,29 Some efforts have been reported in published works to overcome the above shortcomings to a certain extent, such as the addition of surfactants or inorganic additives to PEDOT:PSS.30,31 Meanwhile, many alternative HTL materials with excellent performance have also been explored, such as V2O5, WO3 and other transition metal oxides.32 However, the complex manufacturing processes such as high-temperature annealing and vacuum thermal evaporation limit the further development and application of transition metal oxides as HTLs.
On the other hand, due to their potentially high carrier mobility and excellent optical transparency, low-dimensional transition metal disulfides are considered to be excellent anode modification layers in OSCs.33 WS2 is one of the representatives with superior performance. In the top-down methods, the most common method of thin film preparation is to peel off the WS2 flakes by ultrasonication treatment.34 The properties of the underlying substrate (such as composition or charge traps) are found to affect the film quality of 2D materials (such as graphene sheets).35 Some methods are also applied to improve the characteristics of the substrate such as hydrogen plasma, oxygen plasma, vacuum plasma and pressure treatment,36–39 thereby affecting the morphology and optical properties of the film on such substrates. Therefore, controlling and understanding nano-morphological changes of the low-dimensional transition metal disulfides during the process is a classic problem of surface engineering and is crucial to improve the performance of the interlayer in OSCs.40 However, it is still challenging to control the yield, the film morphology and uniformity of solution-processed WS2 flake layers to promote the work function tuning effect and charge transport in OSCs.
In this work, high-yield multilayer WS2 flakes are prepared by comprehensively controlling the initial concentration before centrifugation, sonication processing time and centrifugal speed to form high-quality HTLs on ITO to replace PEDOT:PSS. The influence of the plasma treatment of the ITO substrate on the consistency of the WS2 film is also studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. Non-fullerene OSCs based on PM6:Y6 with the optimized WS2 interlayer as an HTL achieve a high PCE of 15.75%, which is about 18% higher than that of the OSCs with WS2 prepared without optimization processes (13.35% vs. 15.75%), and even higher than that with PEDOT:PSS as an HTL. The enhanced device performance is attributed to the improved uniformity and charge transport ability of the WS2 HTLs as confirmed by a series of photoelectric technologies, thereby improving the carrier collection efficiency and reducing the bimolecular recombination losses in OSCs. It is further found that WS2 flakes are more likely to adhere to the ITO substrate without plasma treatment and exhibit high-quality film properties.
Results and discussion
Film characteristics
The water-soluble WS2 nanosheets are prepared by mechanical force-assisted liquid exfoliation.41 As shown in the TEM images (Fig. 1a and b), WS2 is delaminated into monolayer or few-flake layers and consequently forms multilayer stacks by controlling the initial concentration, sonication processing time and centrifugal speed. A d-spacing of 0.27 nm corresponding to the (100) plane of WS2 is shown in the inset of Fig. 1c, which is consistent with a previous study.42 The crystal structure of WS2 in Fig. 1d shows a hexagonal lattice, as confirmed by the diffraction characteristics in Fig. S5.† The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image and fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern presented in Fig. 1d further confirm the successful formation of WS2 nanosheets.

To identify the accumulating status of WS2 nanosheets obtained by different processing methods, we performed Raman spectroscopy characterization to study the number of WS2 flake layers.30 The Raman spectra of the WS2 flakes with different sonication processing times and centrifugal speeds are shown in Fig. 2. The typical WS2 phonon modes: E2g1 and A1g, are expected to appear near 350.9 and 417.5 cm−1, respectively.43 As shown in Fig. 2a, the Raman peaks at these two positions increase as the sonication time increases, indicating that more WS2 flakes are exfoliated. On the other hand, the signal intensity of the WS2 phonon modes decreases dramatically with an increase in the centrifugal speed (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, the peak at 323 cm−1 of the Raman spectrum of the film almost disappears after treatment with a centrifugation speed of 8000 rpm, indicating that monolayer or bilayer WS2 has been formed.35

(c) Transmittance spectra of ITOplasma/PEDOT:PSS, ITOplasma/WS2 and ITO/WS2. 
To study the effects of substrate processing conditions on the change in the WS2 content on the substrate, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of WS2 films prepared on ITO with and without plasma treatment (Fig. 3) were investigated. It is found that more WS2 flakes are deposited on the surface of ITO without plasma treatment, while fewer WS2 flakes adhere to the ITO surface treated by plasma (Fig. 3a, b, d and e). By characterizing the Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and elemental mapping analysis of the WS2 films, the concentration, work function and dispersion of the main elements on the surface can be revealed.44 The results indicate that compared with the case of plasma-treated ITO, the sulfur (S) content of the WS2 prepared on the ITO without plasma treatment is doubled, and the tungsten (W) content has also increased on untreated ITO, which confirms that more WS2 flakes can be deposited on the ITO surface without plasma treatment (Fig. 3c and f). The different deposition of WS2 flakes on pristine ITO and plasma-treated ITO is likely affected by the varied chemisorption between WS2 and these two ITO substrates as shown in Fig. S6†. Meanwhile, it can be seen from Fig. 3 that although there are some discrete WS2 flake aggregates, the WS2 film deposited on the original ITO shows a higher yield, and at the same time it has higher coverage and density, resulting in the better overall quality of the film.

The optical properties of HTLs also play a vital role in OSCs since the incident light needs to pass through this layer before it can be further absorbed by the active layer. Thus, we measured the transmission spectra of the devices with the configurations of ITO/WS2, ITOplasma/WS2 and ITO/PEDOT:PSS, respectively (Fig. 2c). The WS2 layer shows better transparency than the PEDOT:PSS layer, especially in the 500 nm–800 nm wavelength range where the energy distribution of the standard solar spectra is higher, which is beneficial for improving the JSC of the device. This can also provide a potentially high transmittance substrate for the further preparation of high-efficiency semitransparent OSCs.45–47
Device fabrication and characteristics
To evaluate the varying effects of the microstructure and physicochemical properties of WS2 subjected to different processing methods, we first fabricated the devices based on the J71:ITIC system by different processing conditions with the device structure ITO/HTL/J71:ITIC/PDINO/Ag. The chemical structures and the energy levels of the different layers used in this study are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. By controlling the initial concentration, sonication time, centrifugal speed and thermal annealing to obtain the best WS2 film as an HTL, the performance of the device has been significantly enhanced, especially the open-circuit voltage (VOC) (Table 1). Using the optimal WS2 as the HTL, the efficiency of the device is 4 times higher than that of the device with unoptimized WS2 as the HTL (9.25% vs. 2.07%), and the device performance is comparable to that of using PEDOT:PSS as an HTL. Through further research on the work function (WF) of WS2 films, we find that the obvious WF shift (from 5.33 eV to 5.78 eV, as shown in Fig. S1† and Table 1) of WS2 films leads to a contact barrier change between the anode and active layer, which may be one of the main reasons for the significant change of Voc. The mean nanosheet thickness of WS2 flakes and the overall thickness of the WS2 films may be the possible factors that influence the WF of WS2.48,49 We believe that an increase in the work function of the ITO–WS2 substrate in Table 1 with an increase in the sonication processing time may be due to an increase in the thickness of the WS2 flakes and a decrease in the mean nanosheet thickness, as shown in Fig. S9.†

To verify the versatility of the WS2 interlayer obtained by the above processes, we used a more efficient PM6–Y6 system to fabricate OSCs via the device structure ITO/HTL/PM6:Y6/PFN–Br/Ag. The photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table 2 and the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 4c. The best PCE of the devices fabricated on optimized WS2 as the HTL is 15.75%, which is even higher than those of the devices with PEDOT:PSS as the HTL, as summarized in Table 2. The enhanced device performance can be attributed to an 8.3% improvement of the short-circuit current (JSC). When the ITO substrate is treated with plasma for 3 minutes, the PCE of the devices using WS2 as the HTL decreases from 15.75% to 13.36%, due to the simultaneous reduction of VOC, JSC and the fill factor (FF), which is consistent with the film properties as discussed previously. It is worth mentioning that the presence of some discrete aggregates in WS2 films may cause more leakage current. This is one of the reasons why higher dark currents are observed in WS2-derived devices than PEDOT:PSS-derived devices in Fig. S7.† The JSCs calculated from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are also consistent with that derived from the photovoltaic performances (Fig. 4d). The higher transmittance of the device with WS2 can work together with the better charge transfer performance of the WS2 layer to improve the EQE, which contributes to a higher JSC of the device. It is worth mentioning that the devices fabricated on WS2 HTLs with plasma-treated ITO substrates perform differently from that described in a previous report,33 probably caused by the different preparations of WS2 films in this paper. In this work, we applied higher concentration and longer sonication processing time in the initial preparation to obtain water-soluble WS2 nanosheets. After that, the spin-coated WS2 films were treated by thermal annealing at 60 °C for 5 min. The morphology of the WS2 films herein is quite different as compared with the previous report, which will be discussed below by a series of morphology characterization studies of the WS2 films.

To investigate the microstructure of the WS2 film layers spun on untreated in situ ITO and plasma-treated ITO substrates, we further conducted grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements, and the corresponding results are presented in Fig. 5. Stronger scattering peaks from WS2 films on untreated in situ ITO are obviously observed in the out-of-plane direction than that on plasma-treated ITO, indicating the preferential orientation of WS2 nanosheets parallel to the substrates, which is in favor of improving the conduction of the HTLs. Meanwhile, from the out-of-plane linecuts, a higher intensity of the peak at around q = 1.30 Å−1 was observed for the ITO/WS2 film, compared with the ITOplamsa/WS2 film (Fig. 5c), also indicating that a more ordered lamellar/layered packing structure of WS2 nanosheets formed on untreated in situ ITO.50 This is consistent with the results of more WS2 nanoflakes deposited to form a dense film as confirmed by the above-mentioned SEM measurement. Notably, we obtained an improved stacking morphology of the WS2 film with higher conductivity by choosing the ITO without plasma treatment as a substrate.

To gain more insight into the morphology of the WS2 layer, the surface morphologies of the active layers fabricated on different HTLs were characterized by AFM measurements under ambient conditions, as shown in Fig. 6. The bright area is likely to be the distribution position of WS2 flakes, while the relatively dark area represents the surface of the ITO substrate. Fig. 6(a) and (d) show that on the ITO surface that has not been treated by plasma, WS2 flakes exhibit good dispersion and the film shows higher uniformity with a thickness of about 3.48 ± 2.00 nm according to the Gauss distribution statistics for the height of thin flakes (Fig. S2†). However, there are fewer WS2 flakes deposited on the plasma-treated ITO surface, so the film uniformity is poor. This is in high accordance with the deposition of WS2 in Fig. 3. Moreover, the PM6:Y6 active layer spun on an untreated in situ ITO based WS2 substrate appears more hydrophilic than that spun on a device with plasma treated ITO, as revealed by the contact angle measurements in Fig. 6c, indicating that more Y6 may accumulate on the surface of the active layer as Y6 is more hydrophilic than PM6 (Fig. S3†), which is beneficial for charge transport in the device. Considering that the surface energy of the substrate may affect the morphology of the active layer,51,52 we further measured the surface morphology of the active layer (PM6:Y6) (Fig. 6b and e). The RMS values of active layers on ITO/WS2 and ITOplasma/WS2 are 0.66 and 1.04, respectively, indicating that the surface morphology of the active layer becomes smoother when coated on an ITO/WS2 substrate as compared with that on ITOplasma/WS2. Consequently, the above optimized WS2 film characteristics will not only facilitate better charge extraction of the anode, but also are more conducive to the active layer deposition on the substrate to form a smoother film, which may be beneficial for the charge separation and transportation processes in the OSCs.

To elucidate the effects of optimized WS2 HTLs on the device charge transport, charge mobility and extraction were investigated. The hole and electron mobilities of the devices were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) methods with the device structures of ITO (plasma or without plasma)/WS2 or PEDOT:PSS/PM6:Y6/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/PM6:Y6/PFN–Br/Ag, respectively (Fig. 7a). The hole mobilities of PM6:Y6 devices based on ITOplasma/PEDOT:PSS and ITOplasma/WS2 are 8.02 × 10−4 and 3.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while the hole mobility of PM6:Y6 devices based on ITO/WS2 was increased to 1.97 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, as presented in Table S1.† In addition, the work function of the optimized WS2 film was found to be 5.67 eV, as confirmed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement (Fig. S4†). Therefore, the significantly improved hole mobility could be attributed to the better film quality and higher conductivity of the WS2 layer, which will further facilitate the charge transport in the devices given that the WF of the WS2 film matches the HOMO energy level of the donor. Notably, a small VOC difference between WS2- and PEDOT-derived devices can be observed as presented in Table 2. The differences in the charge carrier mobilities and leakage current could be the reason for the slightly reduced VOC values in the WS2-derived devices compared to the PEDOT-derived devices.

To study the charge recombination of OSCs with different HTLs, the correlation between JSC and light intensity was further studied (Fig. 7b). The correlation between JSC and light intensity abides by the power law (Jsc ∝ Iα). The values of α of all the devices are close to 1, which indicates that monomolecular recombination dominates in these devices and the photogenerated charge carriers under short-circuit conditions can be effectively extracted and collected by electrodes prior to recombination.53,54 To investigate the charge carrier extraction of the devices, transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements of the OSCs were performed, as shown in Fig. 7c and d. The measurement data and specific fitting results of TPV and TPC of these devices are shown in Fig. S10.† Compared with the device using a WS2 interlayer formed on in situ ITO, as summarized in Table S2,† the charge lifetime of the device using a WS2 interlayer prepared on plasma-treated ITO as an HTL is significantly reduced from 3.95 μs to 1.03 μs, while the charge extraction time increases from 0.65 μs to 0.74 μs, indicating that more severe charge recombination and reduced charge extraction capacity of the device. This is again consistent with the film properties and the device performances as discussed above.
Conclusions
In summary, high-yield and high-quality liquid exfoliated WS2 nano-flaky layers are successfully fabricated on ITO and used as solution-processed HTLs in highly efficient PM6:Y6 non-fullerene OSCs. We find that by depositing the high-quality WS2 suspension obtained after comprehensive optimization factors such as concentration, ultrasonication time and centrifugal speed, onto ITO as an interlayer, the work function of the composite substrate can be made greater than that of PEDOT:PSS. An improved energy level alignment between the substrate and the active layer thus leads to better charge transport in the device, as revealed by the charge transportation characteristics in the OSCs. The GIWAXS, TEM, SEM and elemental mapping results showed that the conductivity, coverage and uniformity of the WS2 flakes spin-coated on untreated in situ ITO are improved compared to those of plasma-treated ITO. As a result, PM6:Y6 BHJ-based OSCs with the above-mentioned multiple optimized WS2 layers as HTLs showed a maximum PCE of 15.75%, which is higher than the value of the PEDOT–PSS based control devices (15.31%). The morphological characteristics and carrier recombination process studies show that the improvement of OSC performance can be attributed to the enhanced charge transport and the reduced bimolecular recombination due to the high quality interlayer. Therefore, this work provides a useful strategy for preparing high-yield and high-quality TMDs as HTLs in efficient OSCs and other optoelectronic devices.

Preparation of WS2 nanosheets with different sizes
WS2 powder was added in a mixture solution containing deionized water and ethanol (1:1 v/v) with concentrations of 6 to 14 mg mL−1. To prepare a small sized WS2 solution, the blend solutions were treated by probe sonication in a 5 °C water bath for 6–12 h (750 W, automatic amplitude). The unexfoliated WS2 was removed by centrifuging the cloudy solutions to the speed of 4000–8000 rpm for 30 min. After centrifugation, the light-yellow transparent supernatant was collected for further operation.
Device fabrication
To begin this process, glass/ITO substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic water bath with a diluted detergent solution, deionized water, and isopropanol, respectively. The ITO dried at 70 °C was treated with O2-plasma for 3 minutes, or directly used without plasma treatment. A PEDOT:PSS solution was spun onto the ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by 15 min annealing at 150 °C. For the HTL of WS2, the WS2 solution was spin coated on ITO substrates at 900 rpm for 30 s, and the samples were quickly transferred to a heating plate at 60 °C for 5 min. J71:ITIC with a weight ratio of 1:1 (total 20 mg mL−1) was dissolved in chloroform. PM6:Y6 was prepared with a ratio of 1:1.2 (total 16 mg mL−1) in chloroform containing 0.5% volume of the 1-chloronaphthalene solvent. All the solutions of the active layer were spin-coated onto the HTLs at 3000 rpm for 40 s. A thin ETL (electron transport layer) of PDINO (1 mg mL−1 in methanol) was spun on top of J71:ITIC at 3000 rpm for 40 s. A thin ETL of PFN-Br (0.5 mg mL−1 in methanol) was spun on top of PM6:Y6 at 3000 rpm for 40 s. The devices were completed by depositing a 100 nm Ag top electrode under vacuum (3 × 10−4 Pa) with a shadow mask. Typical cells have a device area of 5.7 mm2.
Characterization
The morphologies of the as-prepared WS2 nanosheets and HTLs were observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Innova), field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Merlin) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 2100F). The contact angle was tested using DSA-X (Guangzhou, Beto Science and Technology Co., Ltd). Raman spectroscopy analysis was performed using a Renishaw inVia-428K38 microlaser Raman tester, with a 523 nm laser source. The UV-vis transmittance of HTLs was measured using a Lambda 365 system (PerkinElmer). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy was performed using an atmospheric photoelectron spectrometer AC-3 system (RIKEN Instrument Co., Ltd). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were collected using a Keithley 2400 Source under an AM 1.5G spectrum from a solar simulator. The light intensity for the J–V measurements was adjusted with a reference silicon cell (Hamamatsu S1133 certified by National Renewable Energy Laboratory). The EQE test system for spectral characterization was purchased from Enli Technology Co., Ltd. The transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) techniques were based on customized transient measurement systems with a Q-Smart100 nanosecond pulse laser. The film thickness was measured using a DEKTAK 150 Step Profiler. The carrier mobility of the hole-only devices (electron-only devices) was extracted by fitting the voltage via space charge limited current (SCLC). The equation from the Mott–Gurney square law is as follows: J = 9εrε0μV2/8d3, where εr is the relative dielectric constant, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, d is the thickness of the active layers, uh (ue) is the hole (electron) mobility. The grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed at Xenocs (France). The wavelength of the X-ray source was set to 1.34144 Å and the incident angle was 0.2°. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using an X'Pert Powder system (PANalytical) at 300 K. The 2θ range was from 10 to 80° at a step size of 0.013° with a count time of 1 s. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was performed at Thermo Fisher ESCALAB XI + (United Kingdom). High-resolution XPS analysis of C 1s, In 3d, and Sn 3d spectra is shown in Fig. S6, ESI.†
