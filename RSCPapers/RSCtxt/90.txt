    , Accepted 21st April 2008First published on 18th June 2008AbstractThe synthesis, characterization and photophysics of some solution-processable intensely coloured polyplatinynes functionalized with the thienopyrazine–thiophene hybrid spacer and their model molecular complexes are described. These metallated polymers possess extremely low bandgaps of 1.47–1.50 eV, which extend towards the near-infrared (NIR) range of the solar spectrum, and represent the lowest optical bandgaps ever reported for metallopolyynes in the literature. Both polymers can be used to fabricate efficient solar cells with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 0.63% under air mass (AM1.5) simulated solar illumination, and the possibility of covering the 600–900 nm solar-radiation range to harvest photocurrent has been demonstrated. The influence of the thienyl core as well as its substituent group, on the optical and photovoltaic behavior of these metallopolymers was investigated in detail. The power dependencies of the solar cell parameters (including the short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, fill-factor and PCE) were also studied. The present work offers an attractive avenue towards conjugated materials with broad solar absorptions and demonstrates the potential of metallopolyynes for both visible and NIR light power generation.
Introduction
In the past two decades, π-conjugated polymers have become increasingly attractive due to their excellent electronic and optoelectronic properties.1 Representative applications include polymer light-emitting diodes,2polymer solar cells (PSCs),3 photodetectors,3g biosensors4 and field-effect transistors.5 In particular, due to the energy crisis there is an increasing interest in renewable energy resources, including solar photovoltaics, to replace fossil fuels.6 Thus, low cost alternatives to the established silicon semiconductor solar cells, such as dye sensitized solar cells7 and PSCs,3a,g,h are of considerable interest.
Although power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 5–6% have been achieved under air mass (AM1.5) solar simulated solar illumination using conjugated organic polymers,8 their energy conversion efficiencies need to be further improved before true practical realization in commercial devices. At present, the optical bandgaps (Eg) of the substituted poly[p-phenylenevinylene] and the polythiophenes commonly used in PSCs are typically 2.0–2.2 eV,3b,9 and are not optimized with respect to the solar spectrum which ranges from 350 to 1500 nm.10 So, conjugated polymers of very low Eg would be more desirable for the development of efficient organic solar cells due to an improved energy harvesting of the sunlight.
Among other ways, one successful strategy to achieve narrow-bandgap π-conjugated systems involves the alternation of electron-rich donor and electron-deficient acceptor units along the same conjugated chain.11,12Thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine derivatives have been shown to be excellent precursors for the production of low-bandgap conjugated polymers.13 Recently, photovoltaic devices based on a blend of [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and some of these low-bandgap conjugated organic polymers have been reported.13
While encouraging progress has been made over the past few years in the field of PSCs using organic polymers, their metallated analogues represent another intriguing class of materials14 and those derived from platinum alkynyls, i.e. polyplatinynes, are particularly useful.15 To date, however, soluble π-conjugated organometallic polyynes remain much less explored and in most cases, the efficiency is low due to low coverage in the solar spectral region,15b,e although the triplet excited state can be involved in the energy conversion.15b,e We have recently demonstrated efficient solar cells based on polyplatinyne : PCBM bulk heterojunctions with high and tunable PCEs.15a,f,g
However, polymers with an Eg >2.0 eV only absorb radiation in the UV and green part of the visible range. Therefore, chemists have been making efforts to synthesize new low-bandgap polymers to harvest more photons at longer wavelengths to increase the photocurrent. We report here the synthesis, characterization and photovoltaic properties of two low-bandgap metallopolymers (P1 and P2) containing thienopyrazine–thiophene spacers that utilize a donor–acceptor approach to achieve absorption in the 300–900 nm region.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and chemical characterization
The synthesis and chemical structures of the metallopolymers (P1 and P2) and their well-defined model complexes (M1 and M2) are shown in Scheme 1. 5,7-Dibromo-2,3-diphenylthieno[3,4-b]pyrazine16 was coupled with suitable Bu3Sn-substituted thiophenes by Stille coupling17 to yield 2,3-diphenyl-5,7-bis(2-thienyl)thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine and 5,7-bis(4-hexyl-2-thienyl)-2,3-diphenylthieno[3,4-b]pyrazine, which upon iodination with N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) formed L1-I and L2-I, respectively. Conversion of the diiodo derivatives to their corresponding diethynyl congeners could be achieved following the typical organic synthetic routes for the alkynylation of aromatic halides.18 The platinum(II) compounds were prepared by the Sonogashira-type dehydrohalogenation reactions between each of L1 and L2 with the platinum chloride precursors.19 The complexes M1 and M2 can be used as good molecular model systems to investigate the spectroscopic and photophysical properties of P1 and P2. The polymers can be purified by silica column chromatography and repeated precipitation. With these synthetic routes, we obtained the polymers and model complexes with high purity and good solubility. Yields of the polymers were between 59–80%. P1 and P2 could cast tough, free-standing thin films from their organic solutions readily but the use of the long hexyl chains on the thienyl rings was crucial in improving the solubility and solution-processability of P2 relative to P1. The structures were unequivocally characterized using elemental analyses, mass spectrometry, IR and NMR spectroscopies. The NMR data were consistent with the proposed structures of the polymers and model compounds. The peaks arising from the terminal –CCH in the NMR and IR spectra were absent, confirming the metal–alkynyl bond formation. The number-average molecular weights of these polymers were determined using GPC with polystyrene standards, and range from 9020 to 37800 with a polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) between 2.28 and 2.68 and a degree of polymerization of ∼8 for P1 and 29 for P2 (∼24 and 87 heterocyclic rings in total, respectively) (Table 1). The dichloromethane-soluble fraction of P1 was isolated by Soxhlet extraction. The synthetic yield is lower for P1 than P2 owing to the fact that a certain portion of the former polymer formed was organic insoluble. As a consequence of the poorer solubility of P1, the molecular weight of the soluble fraction is believed to be relatively low. Both PtII polymers are air and thermally stable. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) traces (heating rate 20 °C min−1) showed the onset of polymer decomposition at around 356–377 °C. The decomposition onset was defined by a 36 and 23 wt% loss for P1 and P2, respectively, corresponding to the removal of two PBu3 ligands from P1, and one PBu3 group together with a hexyl chain from P2. In differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies, no phase transition signals were detected during repeated heating–cooling DSC cycles using either polymer. This observation probably results from the stiffness of the polymers’ chains.

Photophysical and electrochemical characterization
The absorption and emission spectra of the polymers and model complexes were measured in CH2Cl2 solutions at 293 K. Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of the Pt compounds, monitored both in CH2Cl2 (conc. ∼5 × 10−5 mol dm−3) and as solid thin films, and the data are also compared with those for the ligand precursors (λmax = 368, 582 nm for L1 and 366, 585 nm for L2). The spectra essentially displayed two absorption bands in each case. The absorption features are lowered significantly (by 0.24–0.33 eV) when the metal is introduced, i.e., on going from L1 (or L2) to P1 (or P2), which is in accordance with our expectations for a donor–acceptor π-conjugated compound.13e,20 In contrast to similar Pt compounds, there is hardly any further shift on going from the model compound to the polymer. The absorption properties of M1 (λmax = 410, 655 nm) and M2 (418, 688 nm) are very similar to those of P1 and P2. Hence, the lowest excited state is confined to a single repeat unit. From the similar patterns of the absorption bands of both ligand and polymer, we infer that the absorption is mainly due to the π–π* transition of the conjugated ligand, although the energy levels of the orbitals involved are shifted by strong interactions with the metal center. Moreover, the absorption spectra of the polymers in the solid thin films are slightly red shifted as compared to those recorded in the CH2Cl2 solutions, presumably due to the inter-chain interactions in the film state. Gratifyingly, the optical bandgaps, estimated from the onset of solid-state absorption spectra, are 1.50 and 1.47 eV for P1 and P2, respectively. To our knowledge, these are the lowest among those of any of the polyplatinynes known to date and represent a significant step forward in the development of low-bandgap metallopolymeric materials. Table 2 compares, in terms of their π-conjugative ability, the solid-state colors and Eg of our new materials with some low-bandgap platinum(II) polyynes in the literature in which the addition of thienyl rings always tends to reduce Eg and shift the λmax value to the red. P1 and P2 possess lower Eg than the metallopolyyne with a 9,9-dicyanomethylenefluorene spacer, which had been identified as having the lowest Eg (1.58 eV) known at this time.20 Due to the presence of a more extended π-electron delocalized system throughout the chain and the creation of an alternate donor–acceptor chromophore based on an electron-accepting thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine group in combination with the electron-donating thiophene rings, the Eg value of P1 is significantly lowered by ca. 1.05 eV relative to the purely electron-rich bithienyl (2.55 eV)15e or electron-deficient thienopyrazine (1.77 eV) linked congeners.13e A reduction of the bandgap by 0.27 (0.30) eV is achieved in P1 (P2) by adding one thienyl ring on each side of the thienopyrazine, which results in an onset of optical absorption beyond 800 nm. The same phenomenon applies to the case of the bithienyl–benzothiadiazole hybrid spacer (Table 2). The thienopyrazine ring in P1 and P2 already has a strong donor–acceptor interaction, which can be enhanced by the extensive π-delocalization in the polymer backbone containing the electron-rich PtII ion (Fig. 2). This is a clear indication of the role of strong donor–acceptor interactions in our polymers. We think that a conjugated polymer is formed by a regular alternation of donor- and acceptor-like moieties, possibly separated by neutral parts. If the electron donor and acceptor regions are extended through the Pt center and alkynyl units we have a case analogous to the inorganic n-i-p-i super lattice quantum well structures, giving rise to a remarkable lowering of Eg.21

Absorption spectra of neat P1 and P2, together with those blended with PCBM (1 : 4 and 1 : 5 by weight), are shown in Fig. 3. Each of the neat spectra shows two broad bands spanning from ∼300 to 900 nm (λmax ∼421–427 nm and 687–711 nm). The higher energy peak in the blend films is less pronounced because of the dramatically enhanced absorption in the UV region by the addition of 80 or 83% PCBM.

Previous studies showed that the thienopyrazine moiety can serve as a quenching channel (both radiative and non-radiative) in some conjugated polymers.13d So, we would not expect rich emission features in P1 and P2 and for instance, the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of P1 is as depicted in Fig. 4. It displays one strong peak at 439 nm and a broad weak band at 838 nm, corresponding to each of the two absorption transitions at 412 and 656 nm in P1, respectively. There is no emission from a triplet excited state over the measured spectral window between 1.2 and 3.1 eV for P1 and P2. This is consistent with the energy gap law for conjugated Pt polyynes and their diynes,22 and a trade-off problem between the bandgap and the phosphorescence decay rate is justified. It was shown that the nonradiative decay rate (knr)P from the triplet state increases exponentially with decreasing triplet–singlet energy gap according to the expression (knr)P ∝ exp(−AΔES–T), where ΔES–T is the energy gap for the T1–S0 transition and A is a term controlled by the molecular parameters and vibrational modes.22 Hence, a high-Egpolymer will probably be phosphorescent whereas a low Eg will be detrimental to triplet emission. The fully extended heteroaryl rings in the ligand chromophore greatly reduce the influence of the heavy Pt atom which is mainly responsible for the intersystem crossing and the phosphorescence. So, like the absorption spectra, it is not the triplet state but a ligand-based π–π* excited state that contributes to the photoinduced charge separation in the energy conversion for P1 and P2 without the involvement of a triplet state.15b

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of P1 and P2 were calculated using the onset potentials determined from electrochemical measurements using cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Table 3). The experiments were performed by casting the polymer films on the glassy-carbon working electrode with a Ag/AgCl wire as the reference electrode, at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The solvent in all measurements was deoxygenated MeCN, and the supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M [nBu4N][BF4]. Fig. 5 shows the cyclic voltammograms of the films for P1 and P2 and the relevant data are collected in Table 3. From the onset values of oxidation potential (Eonset, ox) and reduction potential (Eonset, red), the HOMO and LUMO, as well as the electrochemical bandgaps (Egec), of the polymers were calculated according to the following equations: EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.72) eV and ELUMO = −(Ered + 4.72) eV (where the unit of potential is V versusAg/AgCl).23P1 and P2 show a quasi-reversible thienyl oxidation at 0.74 and 0.68 V, respectively and the lower Eonset, ox for P2 is consistent with the increased electron richness of the thienyl ring in the presence of an electron-donating alkyl group. The irreversible waves at −0.76 V for P1 and −0.83 V for P2 are attributed to the reduction of the electron-deficient thienopyrazine moiety in each case. The bandgap energy directly measured from cyclic voltammetry and the optical bandgap energy (Egopt) are close to each other. The discrepancy of both values lies within the range of error.

Polymer photovoltaic behavior
In order to examine if the broad absorption bands of these polymers do make a contribution to the photoelectronic energy conversion in PSCs, photovoltaic devices were fabricated by using each of P1 and P2 as an electron donor and PCBM as an electron acceptor (Table 4). The hole collection electrode consisted of indium tin oxide (ITO) with spin-coated poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) : poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT : PSS), while Al served as the electron collecting electrode. Different solvents and blend ratios were initially tested to identify the optimal fabrication conditions for the blend cells. Chlorobenzene was used throughout the experiments, whereas cells prepared from dichlorobenzene solutions exhibited poorer performance (see ESI‡). Fig. 6 displays the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs recorded under AM1.5 simulated solar illumination, and the cell performance dependence on blend ratio for P1 and P2 is clearly shown. The open-circuit voltage obtained for the best cell was VOC = 0.51 V, the short-circuit current density was JSC = 3.23 mA cm−22, and the fill factor was FF = 0.39, resulting in PCE = 0.63%. These values are comparable to those for some low-bandgap NIR-absorbing organic polymer diodes reported in the literature.13c,24 The performance of P1 or P2 : PCBM cells with a 1 : 5 blend ratio is improved as compared to those with a 1 : 4 ratio. Also, a notable increase in the PCE can be observed in P2 relative to P1 at a 1 : 5 blend ratio. In all diodes, FFs are not very impressive. The relatively low values are at least partly due to the fact that all processing (except PEDOT : PSS annealing and electrode deposition) and measurements were done in an ambient atmosphere which likely results in the presence of traps. We would expect the FF to improve if the fabrication and characterization were to be performed in an inert gas environment. A comprehensive study of charge transport and the influence of traps is necessary to further improve the FF and overall device performance. A further decrease in the thickness of the active layer may lead to an increase in FF, but would also result in lower JSC and PCE due to less absorption of incident light. At the 1 : 5 blend ratio, the higher JSC and the lower VOC of the P2 : PCBM cell compared with its P1 : PCBM counterpart may be a result of the somewhat lower HOMO level of P1 relative to P2.

The EQE for solar cells with both active materials P1 and P2 has been measured, as shown in Fig. 7 for the 1 : 5 blend ratio (see ESI‡ for results at the 1 : 4 ratio). All EQEs of the diodes show onset near 850 nm, and there is a photoinduced charge transfer from the polymer to the PCBM. All of the polymer photodiodes show two EQE peaks, which correspond to the peaks in the absorption spectra of the polymers. The similarity of the absorption spectrum and EQE response demonstrates that the excitons produced by absorption in the polymer are dissociated into charge carriers at the contact between P1 or P2 and PCBM in the active layer, and are subsequently collected at the electrodes. The broad EQE curves for P1 and P2 cover both the visible and NIR regions from 350 up to ∼900 nm with maxima of 26.3 and 48.6%, respectively at the 1 : 5 ratio. The cell performances of P1- and P2-based solar cells (1 : 4) are quite close to each other. The increase in the EQE for the 1 : 5 P2 : PCBM blend (compared to the 1 : 4 blend, as well as P1 : PCBM blends) is likely due to the improved charge collection efficiency, but confirmation of this requires further study of the blend morphology and charge transport in blends with different compositions. The results obtained clearly demonstrate the potential of metallated conjugated polymers as absorber materials in the future design of stable photovoltaic devices for both visible and NIR light power generation. Nevertheless, these devices are still not fully optimized. Further studies are underway to optimize devices based on these promising materials for photovoltaics.

To improve the efficiency of PSCs, it is vital to understand which mechanisms control the J–V characteristics of a given device and the fate of the photogenerated electrons and holes. So, the influence of light intensity on the solar cell parameters is very informative for analyzing internal recombination losses.25 The J–V curves for P2 under different excitation powers and the power dependence of the solar cell parameters are shown in Fig. 8 and 9, respectively. The JSC exhibits a linear dependence on the optical power, while Voc shows some increase and then saturates at higher intensity, which is expected.26 The almost linear photocurrent dependence on the light intensity for voltages approaching VOC does not give a slope of ∼¾, which indicates the absence of space-charge-limited device performance and that the charge-carrier losses in the absorber bulk are dominated by monomolecular recombination under short-circuit conditions. The PCE only decreases slightly with the illumination intensity, reaching a peak of 0.59% at 80 mW cm−2. The FF shows a maximum of 0.39 at a low power level of 20 mW cm−2 but drops gradually at higher light intensities, in agreement with the previously reported power dependence of fill factor in a bulk heterojunction cell.27

Conclusion
In summary, two novel metallated conjugated polymers containing diphenyl-5,7-di(2-thienyl)thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine donor–acceptor units were prepared and characterized. Optical spectroscopy and electrochemical studies suggest very narrow bandgap systems for both polymers. Metallated polymers with extremely low bandgaps are thus achievable and allow greater flexibility in solar cell design. Photovoltaic cells with spectral responses up to about 900 nm were fabricated and investigated in detail and the broad photocurrent spectral responsivity would make them suitable for efficient light harvesting and charge-carrier extraction in PSCs. A peak photocurrent density of 3.23 mA cm−2, photovoltage of 0.51 V, and PCE of 0.63% were achieved under illumination of AM1.5 from a solar simulator. This work represents the first demonstration of efficient infrared photocurrent spectral responses for metallopolyynes. Various applications of such a family of metallopolyynes as NIR photodetection devices would be expected.

General information

Solvents were carefully dried and distilled from the appropriate drying agents prior to use. Commercially available reagents were used without further purification unless otherwise stated. All reagents for the chemical syntheses were purchased from Aldrich or Acros Organics. PCBM was purchased from American Dyes. PEDOT : PSS (Baytron VPAI 4083) was purchased from H. C. Starck. Reactions and manipulations were carried out under an atmosphere of prepurified nitrogen using Schlenk techniques. All reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with Merck pre-coated glass plates. Flash column chromatography and preparative TLC were carried out using silica gel from Merck (230–400 mesh). Fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectra were recorded on a Finnigan MAT SSQ710 system. NMR spectra were measured in CDCl3 on a Varian Inova 400 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer and chemical shifts are quoted relative to tetramethylsilane for 1H and 13C nuclei and H3PO4 for the 31P nucleus.
Physical measurements
UV–vis spectra were obtained on an HP-8453 diode array spectrophotometer. The emission spectra of the polymers were measured on a Photon Technology International (PTI) Fluorescence QuantaMaster Series QM1 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence spectra were also measured using a He–Cd laser (325 nm) as the excitation source, while the spectra were collected using a fiberoptic spectrometer PDA-512_USB (Control Development Inc). The CV measurements were carried out at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 using a eDAQ EA161 potentiostat electrochemical interface equipped with a thin film coated ITO covered glass working electrode, a platinum counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl (in 3 M KCl) reference electrode. The solvent in all measurements was deoxygenated MeCN, and the supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M [nBu4N][BF4]. Thin polymer films were deposited on the working electrode by dip coating in chlorobenzene solution (6 mg cm−3). The onset oxidation and reduction potentials were used to determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels using the equations EHOMO = [−(Eonset, ox (vs.Ag/AgCl)−Eonset (N.H.E. vs.Ag/AgCl)] − 4.50 eV and ELUMO = [−(Eonset, red (vs.Ag/AgCl)−Eonset (N.H.E. vs.Ag/AgCl)] − 4.50 eV, where the potentials for N.H.E. versus vacuum and N.H.E. versusAg/AgCl are 4.50 and −0.22 V, respectively.23 Thermal analyses were performed with the Perkin-Elmer Pyris Diamond DSC and the Perkin-Elmer TGA6 thermal analyzers.

Synthesis of platinum metallopolyynes P1 and P2. 
The polymers were prepared by the dehydrohalogenative polycondensation between trans-[Pt(PBu3)2Cl2]29 and each of L1 and L2. A typical procedure is given for P1 starting from L1.

Polymerization was carried out by mixing L1 (25 mg, 0.05 mmol), trans-[Pt(PBu3)2Cl2] (34 mg, 0.05 mmol) and CuI (3.0 mg) in Et3N–CH2Cl2 (30 cm3, 1 : 1, v/v). After stirring at room temperature overnight under nitrogen, the mixture was evaporated to dryness. The residue was redissolved in CH2Cl2 and filtered through a short silica column using the same eluent to remove the ionic impurities and catalyst residues. After removal of the solvent, the crude product was purified twice by precipitation in CH2Cl2 from MeOH. Subsequent washing with hexane and drying in vacuo gave a deep green solid of P1 (53 mg, 59%).

Solar cell fabrication and characterization
The device structure was ITO/poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) : poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT : PSS)/polymer : PCBM blend/Al. ITO glass substrates (10 Ω per square) were cleaned by sonication in toluene, acetone, ethanol and deionized water, dried in an oven, and then cleaned with UV ozone for 300 s. As-received PEDOT : PSS solution was passed through the 0.45 µm filter and spin-coated on patterned ITO substrates at 5000 rpm for 3 min, followed by baking in N2 at 150 °C for 15 min. The metallopolyyne : PCBM (1 : 4 or 1 : 5 by weight) active layer was prepared by spin-coating the chlorobenzene solution (4 mg cm−3 of metallopolyyne, 16 mg cm−3 of PCBM) at 1000 rpm for 2 min. The substrates were dried at room temperature under a low vacuum (vacuum oven) for 1 h, and then stored under a high vacuum (10–5–10−6 Torr) overnight. The Al electrode (100 nm) was evaporated through a shadow mask to define the active area of the devices (2 mm circle). All the fabrication procedures (except drying, PEDOT:PSS annealing and Al deposition) and cell characterization were performed in air. Power conversion efficiency was determined from J–V curve measurement (using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter) under white light illumination (at 100 mW cm−2). For white light efficiency measurements, an Oriel 66002 solar light simulator with an AM1.5 filter was used. The light intensity was measured by a Molectron Power Max 500D laser power meter. For the measurement of the external quantum efficiency, different wavelengths were selected with an Oriel Cornerstone 74000 monochromator, while the photocurrent was measured with a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter. The light intensity was measured with a Newport 1830-C optical power meter equipped with an 818-UV detector probe.
