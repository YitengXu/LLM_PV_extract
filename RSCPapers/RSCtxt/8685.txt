    , Accepted 20th April 2013First published on 22nd April 2013AbstractA series of molecules based on thienofluorene derivatives as electron donating (D) and benzothiadiazole as electron accepting (A) moieties have been assembled into DAD and ADA architectures in order to investigate the influence of the way of assembling the D and A units along the conjugated backbone, on the photovoltaic performances of bulk heterojunction solar cells. It was found that the major difference in going from ADA to DAD architecture is the change in molecular organization (nematic to crystalline), which increases the charge transport mobility and probably also affects the structural organization in blends with PCBM that ultimately leads to higher photovoltaic performances.
Introduction
Recently, organic small molecules have attracted great interest for their promising photovoltaic properties.1,2 Reported power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of solution processed small molecule bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have increased considerably over the last two years reaching values over 7%.3,4 In regard to their polymer counterparts, small molecules present some advantages. Among them are the better batch-to-batch reproducibility due to their monodisperse nature and the easier purification achievable by using classical chemical techniques such as column chromatography and recrystallization.
The chemistry of organic semiconducting small molecules for organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications is extremely dense and diversified. Indeed, this field benefits from the remarkable progress in synthetic organic chemistry tools allowing a wide variety of conjugated aromatic moieties and pro-quinoid units. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to anticipate the properties of a new class of organic semiconductors due to the lack of systematic studies. Indeed, numerous parameters influence the optoelectronic properties of an organic semiconductor. Some are obvious, such as the choice of the chemical subunits that constitute the material.5–9 On the other hand some parameters are more elusive, such as the nature and the position of solubilizing side chains,10,11 or the way the chosen subunits are assembled.1,12
The purpose of this paper is to investigate how properties are influenced by the way the specific moieties are assembled into a molecular structure designed for OPV applications. A classical molecular architecture, composed of alternating electron-rich (acceptor A) and electron-poor (donor D) units, known for leading to low bandgap organic materials has been chosen as a model system. In the present study, the molecular structure was modified so as to obtain donor–acceptor–donor (DAD) or acceptor–donor–acceptor (ADA) conjugated molecules, while maintaining the same aromatic units and approximately the same number of double bonds. The number and nature of the solubilizing alkyl chains were also kept constant in order to minimize related changes in material properties.10,11 The molecules are made of dioctylfluorene (F) and benzothiadiazole (Bz) units as electron-rich and electron-poor moieties, respectively, and are associated with thiophene (T) units. Thieno(dialkyl)fluorene derivatives are well-known for their high electron donating ability, good solubility and for promoting the formation of well-ordered films.13,14 Benzothiadiazole (Bz) is a good electron acceptor, relatively easy to synthesize and intensively used with success for OPV applications.15
Using these moieties, two different assemblies were then designed: FT–TBzT–TF for the DAD architecture, and the reverse TBzT–TFT–TBzT assembly for the ADA architecture. It is fair to notice that comparable DAD molecular structures have been reported in the literature but were used as electroluminescent materials,16 chemosensors17 or for morphological studies.18 The structures of the investigated molecules are presented in Fig. 1.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterizations
The molecules have been prepared using synthetic routes presented in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Synthetic routes for the preparation of the molecules. 
All molecules are based on the same aromatic units using thiophene and fluorene derivatives as electron-rich moieties and benzothiadiazole as an electron-deficient moiety. Bromofluorene derivative 1 is condensed by Stille reaction onto a 2-trimethyltinthiophene to obtain the corresponding compound 2. A subsequent bromination at the 5-position of thiophene by using NBS in chloroform solution led to the brominated derivative 3. The final DAD molecule is synthesized by cross-coupling of previous brominated compounds with the TBzT trimer functionalized with two trimethyltin groups: 4,7-bis-(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophene-2-yl) benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole.19
The ADA molecule has been synthesized following another synthetic route, starting from the synthesis of the unsymmetrical bithiophene–benzothiadiazole compound 4, by Stille cross-coupling between the 4,7-dibromobenzothiadiazole unit and 5-trimethylstannyl-2,2′-bithiophene.21 After purification using column chromatography, compound 5 is condensed to 5-octyl-2-trimethylstannylthiophene22 to give compound 6. The latter is then iodinated by adding 1 equivalent of NIS in a mixture of chloroform and acetic acid to give the iodide compound 7.
Finally, the ADA molecule is obtained by a Suzuki cross-coupling of compound 6 and the commercially available 2,7-diboronic acid-9,9-dioctylfluorene. All molecules have been characterized using 1H and 13C NMR, and the final molecules were additionally analyzed using the MALDI-TOF technique (see Experimental section).
Thermal and structural properties
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM) have been performed to investigate the thermal properties of the molecules. The results reveal very different thermal behavior and a different type of organization for both molecules. Indeed, a crystalline state is observed for the DAD molecule, with a melting point at 134 °C. On the other hand, a nematic liquid crystal phase is observed for the ADA molecule, as evidenced by the characteristic Schlieren texture obtained by POM observation (Fig. 3). The nematic phase in ADA is quite stable and extends up to Tiso = 206 °C. At low temperatures, a crystalline state, only present during the first heating ramp (Tm = 102 °C), leaves out a glassy state at low temperature, ca. Tg = 38 °C (Fig. 3).

Both molecules exhibit a two bands feature spectrum as usually observed for an alternating D–A molecule.23 The high energy band is attributed to a π–π* transition while the low energy one is ascribed to an internal charge transfer (ICT) band. In solution, the ADA UV-visible spectrum presents an interesting feature with a significant merging of both bands in comparison to the DAD analogue. The red-shift of about 26 nm of the π–π* band could be explained by a conjugation extension of the electron-donating segment in the ADA molecule compared to the DAD one (i.e. 6 aromatic units in the unique donor segment of ADAvs. only 4 aromatic units per donor segment in DAD). On the other hand, the origin of the 25 nm blue-shift of the ICT band remains unclear.
In the solid state, both DAD and ADA molecules show a red-shift of their maximum absorption wavelengths. The red-shift of both absorption peaks points out enhanced π-stacking interactions in the solid state for every investigated molecule. The DAD molecule presents a red-shift of 22 nm leading to an optical bandgap of 1.78 eV which has been estimated from the absorption peak onset in the solid state. In agreement with the DSC analysis previously described, this red-shift indicates clearly a rather good solid-state organization for the DAD molecule (crystalline). The ADA molecule shows a stronger red-shift of around 42 nm in the solid state, leading to an optical band gap of 1.85 eV. It remains unclear why the ADA molecule leads to such a bathochromic effect in its nematic phase, far exceeding what is observed in the DAD counterpart in its crystalline state (22 nm). Finally, it is worth noting that the ADA thin solid film presents a very broad absorption spectrum with an almost complete merging of the π–π* and ICT bands.
Furthermore, extinction coefficients have been measured for both molecules in solution. DAD presents a slightly higher extinction coefficient of 77000 M−1 cm−1 compared to 70000 M−1 cm−1 in the case of ADA. This could be due to a higher molecular orbital HOMO and LUMO overlap in the DAD molecule. In order to better understand this specific point, we performed Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations (in vacuum) using Spartan 10 on each molecule.24 The structures obtained for the two molecules are presented in Fig. 5. To keep the calculation time reasonable, the alkyl side-chains were substituted by methyl groups.
 Fig. 5  Conformation and electronic structures of the conjugated core of molecules DAD and ADA, with the frontier molecular orbital surfaces HOMO (left) and LUMO (right). 
The results clearly show that both the HOMO and LUMO orbitals are localized in the central part of the molecule in DAD, explaining the higher extinction coefficient measured for this latter molecule. The HOMO orbitals in ADA are similarly localized in the central part. In this case however, the LUMO orbitals are more localized onto the two benzothiadiazole moieties. The lower molecular orbital overlap, resulting from this unsymmetrical nature, might therefore be responsible for the slightly lower absorption coefficient in the ADA molecule.
Cyclic voltammetry investigations were performed in the solid state in order to measure the redox potentials and subsequently determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the molecules. The redox potentials as well as the corresponding HOMO and LUMO levels for all molecules in the solid state are summarized in Table 2.

In the solid state, no reduction wave could be detected for the DAD molecule. However, it presents a reversible oxidation wave. The HOMO levels have been calculated by using the following equation: HOMO (eV) = Eonsetox (V) + 4.4 eV (with the assumption that the energy level of ferrocene is 4.4 eV below the vacuum level), while the LUMO levels have been calculated by adding the optical bandgap Eoptg previously measured to the former HOMO value.
The ADA molecule presents both quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction waves. The oxidation potential is observed for a lower voltage than for DAD, leading to a HOMO level value of 5.36 eV. Despite the presence of two electron-accepting benzothiadiazole units in the ADA molecule, the electronic affinity is only slightly decreased in comparison to the DAD molecule. The LUMO level is located at 3.51 eV.
Charge transport and photovoltaic properties
The charge transport was investigated by means of field-effect transistors (FET). The hole mobility value measured for the nematic ADA molecule is 1.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is a low value but is typical of nematic compounds of low molecular weight.25 The hole mobility measured for the crystalline DAD molecule gives only a slightly higher value of 4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. This last value is surprisingly low, when considering the crystalline nature of the corresponding compound. However, since in FET devices charge transport takes place parallel to the substrate plane along the interface with the dielectric layer, this result may point out that the preferential charge transport axes (along the π–π stacking) for the DAD molecule are oriented out of plane.
The photovoltaic performances of the two molecules were investigated through their application in classical BHJ solar cells using the [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as an electron-accepting component. The devices were fabricated using a glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/molecule:PC61BM blend/Al structure, with various molecule:PC61BM weight ratios. The best performances achieved for each molecule are reported in Table 3, together with the corresponding blend ratio.

The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.2% was obtained on a device using a DAD:PC61BM blend with a 1:1 weight ratio and a 180 nm thick active layer (measured using a profilometer). This active layer has been obtained by spin-coating a DAD solution in chlorobenzene (15 mg mL−1) using spin-coating parameters listed in the experimental part. Under identical experimental conditions (but differing in optimal blend weight ratios with PC61BM), a surprisingly low PCE of 0.55% was achieved with the ADA molecule, despite its relevant optoelectronic properties, and the good Voc value of 0.68 V in accordance with the HOMO level measured using cyclic voltammetry.26 This result most likely arises from the liquid crystalline nature of the ADA molecule that prevents suitable bulk morphology when blended with PC61BM. Despite the long-range molecular organization in the nematic phase that should be beneficial for charge transport, its high fluidity is thought to be detrimental by favoring the expulsion of PC61BM out of the nematic ADA medium. This assumption is supported by the rapid collapse of the short circuit current density Jsc of the devices with a relatively low temperature thermal annealing (below 80 °C). It is worth mentioning that BHJ solar cells based on blends of PC61BM with (smectic) liquid crystal polymers have already been reported in the literature. In most cases, moderate to low PCEs were measured due to poor nanoscale morphology and/or poor exciton dissociation, thus strongly corroborating the fullerene eviction phenomenon from the liquid crystal medium.27–31 This peculiarity should be amplified in the case of ADA molecules because of the quite higher fluidity of the nematic phase (vs. smectic phase) and the lower molecular weight of the system. The experimental results obtained in the present study constitute therefore a good example of how morphology can dominate over the frontier orbital energy position in such a complex system as a bulk heterojunction solar cell. A similar conclusion was furthermore drawn from another recent study on donor–acceptor based small-molecules.32
Conclusions
We synthesized molecules made of thieno(dioctyl)fluorene derivatives as electron donating (D) units and benzothiadiazole as electron-accepting (A) units, assembled in DAD and ADA architectures in order to investigate the structure–property relationships of small molecules for solution processable bulk heterojunction solar cells. Surprisingly, both molecules present similar optical properties as well as electronic properties. However, a major difference is observed in their structural behavior. While DAD molecule presents a crystalline nature, ADA is a nematic liquid crystal. This structural difference results in deep morphological variations in both molecules when blended with PC61BM. Indeed, the DAD molecule showed the highest PV performances with a PCE of 2.2% against only 0.5% for the ADA molecule. This indicates that if the optoelectronic properties are strongly dependent on the nature of the chemical sub-unit and less on the way they are assembled along the conjugated backbone, the molecular architecture has also a considerable impact on the solid-state structure and ultimately on the PV performances. Other series of molecules based on the DAD architecture are currently being investigated as solution processable small-molecules for photovoltaic applications.
Experimental section
Materials
All reagents and chemicals were purchased from commercial sources (Aldrich, Across, Fluka) and used without further purification. All reactions were carried out in an argon atmosphere. All solvents were distilled over appropriate drying agent(s) prior to use and were purged with nitrogen. The starting 2-bromo(dioctyl)fluorene derivate 1 was prepared by classical reaction alkylation of the commercial 2-bromofluorene.33
Characterizations

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance 300 and Bruker 400 UltrashieldTM NMR spectrometers, with an internal lock on the 2H-signal of the solvent (CDCl3). UV-visible absorption spectroscopy measurements were performed using a Hitachi U-3000 spectrophotometer. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed on a DSC Q2000 from TA Instrument. Optical microscopy observations were made using a polarizing Leitz Weitzlar microscope equipped with a Mettler FP82 heating stage. Cyclic voltammetry analyses were carried out with a BioLogic VSP potentiostat using platinum electrodes at scan rates of 20 mV s−1. The measurements were performed on thin films drop-casted from chloroform solutions onto a platinum working electrode. A Pt wire was used as a counter electrode and Ag/Ag+ as a reference electrode in acetonitrile containing 0.1 mol L−1 of tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate. Ferrocene was used as internal standard to convert the values obtained in reference to Ag/Ag+ to the saturated calomel electrode scale (SCE).
Field Effect Transistors in bottom-contact configuration were elaborated on commercially available pre-patterned test structures whose source and drain contacts were composed of a 30 nm thick gold layer on top of a 10 nm thick Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) layer. A 230 nm thick silicon oxide was used as a gate dielectric and n-doped (3 × 1017 cm−3) silicon as a gate electrode. The channel length and channel width were 20 μm and 10 nm, respectively. The test structures were cleaned in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and subsequently for 15 minutes in an ultra-violet ozone system. Then, hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) was spin coated (500 rpm for 5 s and then 4000 rpm for 50 s, acceleration 200 rpm s−1) under nitrogen ambient conditions and followed by an annealing step at 135 °C for 10 minutes. Finally, 4 mg mL−1 anhydrous chloroform small molecule-based solutions were spin coated (1250 rpm for 60 s and 2000 rpm for 120 s, acceleration: 200 rpm s−1) to complete the FET devices. The samples were then left overnight under vacuum (<10−6 mbar) to remove residual solvent traces. The output and transfer transistor characteristics were measured using a Keithley 4200 Semiconductor Characterization System. All measurements were performed under a controlled (N2) atmosphere and the charge carrier mobility was extracted from the saturation regime of the transistors transfer characteristics.
Bulk heterojunction devices were elaborated using the different synthesized molecules as an electron donor and PC61BM as an electron acceptor. The standard device structure was the following: ITO/PEDOT:PSS(∼40 nm)/small molecules:PC61BM/Al(∼120 nm). ITO-coated glass with a surface resistance lower than 20 Ω sq−1 was used as a transparent substrate. Substrates were cleaned sequentially by ultrasonic treatments in acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized water. After an additional cleaning for 30 minutes under ultra-violet generated ozone, a 40 nm thick PEDOT:PSS layer was spin coated (1550 rpm for 180 s with an acceleration of 500 rpm s−1) from an aqueous solution and dried for 30 minutes at 120 °C under vacuum before being transferred to the nitrogen filled glove box. The chlorobenzene small molecules:PC61BM solutions were stirred for at least 24 hours at 70 °C before spin-coating. An extra stirring for 30 minutes at 100 °C was added just before the active layer deposition. The molecule concentration of the solution was varied from 5 mg mL−1 up to 20 mg mL−1 in order to obtain different active layer thicknesses (see ESI†). The small molecules:PC61BM weight ratio was also varied from 1:0.5 to 1:3. The active layer spin-coating conditions in a two-step procedure were: step 1 for 180 seconds (speed: 2200 rpm, acceleration: 600 rpm s−1), then step 2 for 120 seconds (speed: 2500 rpm, acceleration: 600 rpm s−1). Finally, a 120 nm thick aluminum layer was thermally evaporated and used as cathode. The device active area was 9 mm2, while each sample included four independent diodes. The photovoltaic devices were characterized in a controlled (N2) atmosphere. The light source was a class A Lot-Oriel solar simulator fitted with a AM1.5G filter. The standard 100 mW cm−2 illumination power was checked before the photovoltaic measurements using a single-crystal calibrated silicon solar cell. The current vs. voltage measurements were performed using a Keithley 2400 Source Measurements Unit.
