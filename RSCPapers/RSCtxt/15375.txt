    , Accepted 10th December 2020First published on 12th December 2020AbstractPorphyrin-based photocatalytic oxygen evolution (POE) has exhibited great potential in artificial photosynthesis; however, a few reports exist on efficient nanocatalytic systems due to the fast photoinduced charge recombination. Here, cobalt(III) tetraphenylporphyrin (CoP) nanowires (NWs) are first synthesized at a large-scale via a simple chemical reaction, and transformed in situ into zero-dimensional CoP/NGQDs nanocomposites by adding nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) as the template and dopant. Under the visible light irradiation, no detectable POE activity of CoP NWs is observed in an acid heterogeneous system, while the currently highest POE rate on the molecule (350 μmol g−1 h−1) is achieved with CoP/NGQDs as the photocatalyst. Systematic experiments reveal that the NGQDs-limiting self-assembly of CoP molecules along the axial direction and subsequent formation of Z-scheme CoP/NGQDs heterojunctions are crucial for efficient POE. The nanostructures lead to enough exposure of the central Co atom as POE active sites and longer recombination lifetime of the photoinduced charge in CoP/NGQDs (87.8 ps) than that in CoP NWs (32.2 ps) due to the generation of (CoP+·NGQDs−)* exciplex. This work provides a new strategy to use a nature-like semiconductor molecule as a direct catalyst for artificial photosynthesis.
1. Introduction
It is a promising way to relieve the current environmental and energy issues via directly transforming solar energy into useful chemical fuels. At present, photocatalytic water splitting and/or CO2 conversion are the most potential artificial photosynthesis technologies to realize the above objectives.1–4 As we know, the overall photocatalytic reaction can be divided into two half-reactions, involving reduction and oxidation reactions. For water splitting and CO2 reduction, the half-reaction of water oxidation is usually regarded as the rate-determining step due to the sluggish reaction kinetics or high overpotential of the interfacial reaction.3,4 Therefore, photocatalytic water oxidation has always been a challenge and has seriously hindered the development of artificial photocatalysis. Molecules with porphyrin rings are ubiquitous in natural organisms, and they usually have a good activity to participate in the biological processes as various enzyme active sites.5,6 Due to the typical absorption of 400–450 nm Soret band and 500–700 nm Q band with high extinction coefficient, they are ideal visible-light-responsive photoelectric materials as a photosensitizer and even as catalysts with the suitable energy level.7–9 Unfortunately, the short lifetime and the radius of the Frenkel exciton in semiconductor molecules are the major obstacles for their application in the photoelectric process. Up to now, the first efficient way is to synthesize metal porphyrin (MPs) through the coordination between a porphyrin ring (PR) and different metal atoms. Compared with metal-free porphyrin, MPs as a kind of typical molecule semiconductor with a stable conjugated structure and metal–ligand charge transfer (MLCT) state, exhibit a longer triplex-state exciton lifetime. As usual, their central metal atoms are the active sites when MPs act as catalysts.10 These merits endow MPs with obvious advantages of photocatalytic oxygen evolution (POE), e.g. cobalt porphyrin (CoP).
Sakai et al. first reported a homogeneous system with CoP as the direct catalyst for POE.11 Their work showed promising potential application of CoP and opened a new way for the study of nature-like POE based on semiconductor molecules. Subsequently, various studies of CoP-based POE were explored in the homogeneous system by modifying or adjusting the molecular structures.12,13 For example, it was found that the axial coordination of central metal may be beneficial to the reactant adsorption and catalytic splitting of water or CO2 molecules owing to the high metal valence state.14 However, the corresponding POE activity was not obviously increased. The slow development of MP-based POE may not only suffer from low stability, complicated system and difficulty in recycling11,15,16 but also from a short lifetime of Frenkel or intramolecular charge transfer excitons because of strong coulombic interaction between the photoinduced holes and electrons.17 Recently, Zhu et al. demonstrated that a full-spectrum metal-free porphyrin can achieve the water splitting and pollutant degradation as the direct photocatalyst through molecule self-assembly.7 This is the second efficient way for the photocatalysis of a semiconductor molecule because the intermolecular charge transfer exciton has a longer lifetime and radius than those for Frenkel and/or intramolecular excitons. To date, many MP-based catalysts, such as ZnTPyP nanoparticles for the hydrogen evolution reaction and rhodium(III)–porphyrin metal–organic framework for the CO2 reduction,18,19 have been widely studied. However, few studies have reported on POE. How about MP molecule nanostructures for POE, e.g., CoP nanomaterials? At present, it is still unknown and remains a great challenge. Despite the improvement in the lifetime from intramolecular Frenkel exciton and MLCT, one to intermolecular one, the MP-based photoelectric process still suffers from the quicker recombination of excitons compared to those of long-lifetime Wannier exciton. Now, the third efficient strategy has been provided to promote charge separation by constructing the Z-scheme or II type semiconductor heterojunctions.1,20,21 Nevertheless, it is not easy to prepare the MP-based nano-heterojunction for POE because strong intramolecular interactions and energy level match must be carefully thought about.22
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with the outstanding properties of quantum dots and graphene have attracted increasing attention in various fields, e.g. catalysis,23–27 sensors28 and bio-imaging29 owing to good biocompatibility and stable photoluminescence. In addition, many reported works have proved that the doped GQDs possess better photoelectric properties.30 For example, Teng et al. achieved overall water splitting on the oxygen/nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots.23 Suib et al. found that the rapid photogenerated electron transfer from g-C3N4 to NGQDs may improve the efficient charge separation in g-C3N4.31 In this work, we firstly synthesized nanostructures of CoP and CoP/NGQDs via a facile wet chemical reaction on a large scale. The in situ production of CoP/NGQDs nanocomposites (NCs), which were confirmed to be the Z-scheme heterostructure, is reported in our work. Under visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), the currently highest POE rate of 350 μmol g−1 h−1 on the molecule was attained in the acid nanocatalytic system when AgNO3 was used as the electron acceptor. The POE mechanism was carefully discussed through the analysis of structures, components and photoelectric properties of CoP NWs and CoP/NGQDs NCs. The work paves an efficient way for the application of nature-like functional molecules in artificial photosynthesis.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of precursor CoP·ClO4
Co(III)P·ClO4 of cobalt(II) tetraphenylporphyrin (CoP) was prepared according to the following chemical reaction (1). 2CoP + 2AgClO4 + I2 = 2CoP+·ClO4− + 2AgI↓(1)
First, 0.6854 g (1.0 mmol) of Co(II)P, 0.1269 g (0.5 mmol) of iodine (I2) and 0.2073 g (1.0 mmol) of AgClO4 were dissolved in 50 mL of anhydrous CH2Cl2, 8 mL of anhydrous CH2Cl2 and 4 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile, respectively. Then, AgClO4/acetonitrile and I2/CH2Cl2 solutions were poured into the CoP solution in that order and with stirring. The yellowish precipitate of AgI was removed by centrifuging at 10000 rpm for 5 min. The filtrate was added to petroleum and maintained for 30 min. The final precipitate including precursor Co(III)P·ClO4 was collected for further use.
2.2 Synthesis of nitrogen-doped GQDs
First, 3.8 mmol (0.7985 g) of citric acid monohydrate and 7.6 mmol (1.011 g) of ethylene diamine hydrochloride were dissolved in 70 mL of ultrapure water. Then, the mixture was placed into a Teflon-lined autoclave to react at 160 °C for 8 h. Subsequently, the as-obtained mixture was concentrated by vacuum evaporation to remove water. The as-collected products were dispersed into 70 mL DMF, and then reacted in the Teflon-lined autoclave at 160 °C. The product was treated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter membrane to remove the bulk production. Finally, the concentrated mixture was dialyzed using a dialysis bag (MWCO: 1000 Da) to obtain NGQDs for further use.
2.3 Preparation of CoP nanowires
In a typical process, 1.0 mL of 1.0 mM CoP·ClO4/acetonitrile solution was quickly injected into 7.0 mL of 10.0 mM FeSO4 solution. After aging for 3 h, the precipitate was collected and washed twice with ultrapure water for further characterization.
2.4 Preparation of CoP/NGQDs nanocomposites
The preparation process of CoP/NGQDs nanocomposites is similar to that of CoP nanowires. Note that 1.0 mL of 1.0 mM CoP·ClO4/acetonitrile solution was injected into the 10.0 mM FeSO4 solution, containing different content of NGQDs. After 3 h, the precipitate was collected through centrifugation, and then washed twice with ultrapure water for further use.
2.5 Photoelectric and electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical measurements were conducted on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (ChenHua Instruments, Shanghai, China). A platinum gauze, Ag/AgCl electrode and 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH = 4.6) were used as the counter electrode, reference electrode and the electrolyte, respectively. The catalyst slurry was prepared by mixing 5 mg of sample, 0.9 mL of isopropanol and 0.1 mL of Nafion solution (Dupont, 5 wt%) with ultrasonication for 10 min. Then 50 μL of the slurry was coated onto an ITO-conductive glass (1 cm × 2 cm) that acted as a working electrode after the solvent was volatilized. In the transient photocurrent response measurement, the 300 W Xe lamp with the UV-cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm) was used as the light source. The photocurrent data were collected via the electrochemical workstation at the 20 second interval. During the electrochemical impedance measurement, the potential was 0.7 V vs. RHE, and the frequency was 105–0.1 Hz.
2.6 Photocatalytic oxygen evolution test
The online POE test was conducted in a closed gas circulation and evacuation system (Beijing Perfectlight, Labsolar-6A) using a 300 W Xe lamp (Beijing Perfectlight, PLS-SXE300BF) equipped with a 420 nm optical cutoff filter as the light source. In our experiment, 1 mg CoP/NGQDs powder as a catalyst was dispersed in 100 mL water containing 10 mM AgNO3 (pH = 5.0). The system temperature was maintained at 5 °C by circulating cold water during the POE process. In recycling experiments, the sample was collected through centrifugation and washed with 1 M HNO3 solution after every POE test. The evolved gases were analysed in situ using a gas chromatograph (Techcomp, GC7900) equipped with a 5 Å molecular sieve column and a thermal conductivity detector, and helium as the carrier gas.
2.7 Apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) measurement
In our test, the AQE was measured under the low-power light irradiation. The wavelength of the incident light was controlled by applying some appropriate band-pass filter (420, 450, 500 and 550 nm) on the Xe lamp. The apparent quantum efficiency of oxygen evolution was calculated using the following equation:    where n is the evolved amount of O2 molecule (mol) during the photocatalysis reaction. NA, h and c are the Avogadro constant, Plank constant and the speed of light (3 × 108 m s−1), respectively. S is the irradiation area of 26.4 cm2 in our experiment condition. P and λ represent the intensity (1.5 mW cm−2) and wavelength (m) of irradiation light. t is the irradiation time (s).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of CoP and CoP/NGQDs nanostructures
The CoP and CoP/NGQDs nanomaterials were synthesized via the chemical method, as illustrated in Scheme 1. After 1 mL of 1 mM CoP·ClO4 was quickly added into 7 mL of 10 mM FeSO4 aqueous solution, the precipitate formed and was collected for further analysis. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) were first used to analyze the as-collected samples. The SEM images in Fig. 1a and b indicate the formation of a large number of nanowires with a diameter of ∼80 nm. The PXRD patterns in Fig. 1c show that the as-synthesized samples should include crystals, which may be indexed to the single crystal of monoclinic CoP (C44H30ClCoN4O, CCDC no. GAMTAP). Its space group is P21/c, and unit cell parameters are a = 13.542 Å, b = 25.760 Å, c = 10.423 Å and β = 99.33°. The three strong PXRD peaks of CoP NWs at 6.26°, 6.86° and 7.24° should belong to the (100), (020) and (110) facets, respectively. Compared with the simulated strong diffraction peaks of CoP at 6.60°, 6.86°, 7.44°, the diffraction angles of (100) and (110) facets of CoP NWs decreased by 0.34° and 0.20°, respectively, while that of (020) facet was unchanged. The increase of interplanar spacing in nanocrystals mainly results from the size effect of nanomaterials, which leads to lattice distortion or loose. Therefore, the result reveals that the ±(100) and ±(110) facets may be nearly parallel to the growth direction of NWs. Here, note that the central Co atom is axially coordinated with the Cl atom and a water molecule (H2O), as shown in Fig. 1d. The high-resolution TEM image shown in Fig. 1e indicates that the single nanowire should be the CoP single crystal with high crystallinity. The d-spacing of 1.25 nm can be assigned to ±(100) facets of CoP crystal. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) in Fig. 1e proves that the CoP NWs grew along the [001] direction. Hence, four side facets of CoP NWs should be ±(020) and ±(100), agreeing with the PXRD results. Fig. 1f shows the corresponding crystal structure of CoP NWs shown in Fig. 1e, in which the CoP NWs almost grow along the axial direction of the Co atom. It means that the self-assembly of CoP molecules should be through the intermolecular π–π interaction and the H-bond between Cl from ClO4− ion and H atoms in the water molecule. No signals of Cl and Fe atoms were observed in the energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shown in Fig. S1a and b,† respectively, revealing that the axial Cl atom and possibly Fe atom do not exist on the surface of CoP NWs. To further investigate whether Fe2+ may be doped in CoP NWs, NaBH4 and Na2SO3 were used to replace FeSO4 as a reductant. It was found that the PXRD patterns of three reduction products are almost the same in Fig. S2,† suggesting that the shift of PXRD peaks in Fig. 1c did not result from the Fe2+ doping.

The NGQDs were obtained through the hydrothermal and sequential solvothermal methods.32 TEM image in Fig. 1g shows the uniformly dispersed NGQDs with a diameter of ∼3 nm. The inset HRTEM image clearly exhibits the lattice fringes of NGQD with the d-spacing of 0.21 nm, which is usually from the (100) facet of graphene.23 The atomic force microscopy (AFM) image in Fig. S3† shows a thickness distribution between 0.5 and 1.0 nm for NGQDs, suggesting that the sample is mainly composed of 2–3 layers of graphene. Similar to the preparation of CoP NWs, the CoP/NGQDs NCs were synthesized using the FeSO4 solution containing NGQDs without any change in the amount of CoP·ClO4.
To observe the effect of NGQDs and supersaturation on the morphology of CoP NWs in situ, the volume of FeSO4 solution (3, 5, 7 mL) and the solid contents of NGQDs (0.01, 0.03, 0.09 mg mL−1) were adjusted, respectively. The SEM images of responding samples are shown in Fig. 2a–i. It can be seen that the CoP molecules still preferred to self-assemble along the 1D direction, especially while the volume of FeSO4 solution was decreased to 3 mL despite the existence of NGQDs. Interestingly, the CoP NWs gradually disappear with the increase of solid content and the aqueous volume of NGQDs, indicating an increase in the amount ratio of NGQDs to CoP molecules. Furthermore, increasing number of nanoparticles (NPs) with a size of ∼40 nm can be found. These phenomena strongly imply that with the decrease of CoP monomer concentration and the ratio increase of NGQDs to CoP, the CoP/NGQDs NCs may be efficiently formed. This may be attributed to the existence of stronger interaction between CoP and NGQDs than that between CoP and CoP molecules in this system. No obvious shape can be observed for CoP/NGQDs NCs in Fig. 2j and k. Their PXRD pattern in Fig. 1c reveals that the crystallinity of these NCs disappears. These phenomena are consistent with its HRTEM results in Fig. 2l, in which no detectable crystal planes of CoP were found. Moreover, no obvious diffraction peaks of NGQDs may be ascribed to the low content of NGQDs. However, (100) facet of GQDs with a size of 2–3 nm and obvious d-spacing of 0.21 nm can be clearly identified around CoP/NGQDs NCs in Fig. 2l. The above results confirm that the CoP/NGQDs heterojunctions should have been successfully produced with the disappearance of CoP NWs in our experiments. Here, the disappearance of 1D CoP nanocrystals strongly indicates that NGQDs may be seen as a 2D template in the nucleation state of CoP nanostructure and should be doped into CoP aggregates to form CoP/NGQDs NCs due to the existence of strong interactions between CoP molecules and NGQDs.

The volume of FeSO4 solution and solid content of NGQDs is labelled. (j) SEM, (k) TEM and (l) HRTEM images of CoP/NGQDs NCs. The unlabelled scale bar is 100 nm. 
To investigate the components and structures of CoP NWs and CoP/NGQDs NCs, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and XPS studies were conducted. As shown in Fig. 3a, the peak at 3744 cm−1 can be attributed to the O–H stretching vibration of coordinated water in the as-synthesized CoP molecule.33 No signals for water molecules were found in the CoP raw materials. Furthermore, the typical peak for CO stretching vibration at 1707 cm−1 can be found in both NGQDs and CoP/NGQDs NCs, indicating the successful recombination of CoP molecules with NGQDs.24,34 The CoP/NGQDs NCs were further analyzed by XPS. In Fig. S4,† the XPS peak for Co3+ 2p3/2 at 780.2 eV appears in both CoP NWs and CoP/NGQDs NCs.35 The result manifests the axial coordination of the Co atoms, which is consistent with the PXRD and FT-IR data. Cl atoms were not detected by XPS, revealing that most of the axial Cl atoms may be situated in the interior of the CoP nanostructure. The O 1s spectra of CoP/NGQDs NCs in Fig. 3b may be divided into quinones (530.2 eV), O–CO (532.1 eV), C–O–H (532.6 eV) and H2O (534.1 eV).36 Indeed, H2O molecules may be clearly detected in both CoP NWs and CoP/NGQDs NCs. The existence of the –OH group in CoP NWs may be owing to the hydrolysis of Fe ions from FeSO4 found on the surface of CoP NWs (see Fig. S5†). For the N 1s XPS spectrum of CoP/NGQDs in Fig. 3c, the peak at 398.8 eV is from the pyrrolic nitrogen in the CoP porphyrin ring, and the peak at 401.0 eV may be assigned to graphite nitrogen in NGQDs.37 The result confirms the formation of both nitrogen-doped GQDs and CoP/NGQDs NCs. In addition, it is found that, compared to that in CoP NWs, the binding energy of pyrrolic nitrogen in CoP/NGQDs NCs decreases by 0.1 eV, suggesting a slight increase in the Co–N bond length due to the strong interaction between the axial atom (e.g. Cl, O) and NGQDs.38

3.2 Photoelectric property and POE activity
The UV-vis absorption spectra of CoP NWs, NGQDs and CoP/NGQDs NCs were measured in the aqueous dispersed system. As shown in Fig. 3d, the Soret and Q bands absorption of CoP are located at 402 and 540 nm, which may be attributed to the π–π* electron transition (ET) of the porphyrin ring and the charge transfer from ligand to metal (LMCT), respectively.39 The shoulder peak of CoP aggregate at ∼460 nm can be observed. The absorptions for NGQDs at 338 and 432 nm belong to the n–π* and π–π* ET, respectively, which are the ET from graphitized (sp2 CC) and defects (e.g. C–N, C–O, etc.) ground state to excited state (π*).24 After the formation of CoP/NGQDs NCs, the maximal absorption at ∼420 nm is actually closer to that of the solar light. Besides, the three obvious changes can be seen as follows. (1) The Soret band absorption shows a significant redshift from 402 nm to 420 nm, while the Q band does not change compared to that of CoP NWs. (2) The aggregate peak of CoP at ∼460 nm nearly disappears, which further manifests enough charge recombination between CoP molecules and NGQDs. (3) The peak intensity of NGQDs at 432 nm is extremely enhanced. These results imply that the change of molecular structure and interaction between CoP and NGQDs due to the ET of the porphyrin ring from CoP to NGQDs without the change in MLCT state energy level. Fig. 3e and S6† show the photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved fluorescence spectra of CoP NWS and CoP/NGQDs NCs. Upon excitation of 410 nm, the PL intensity of CoP in CoP/NGQDs significantly weakens compared to that of pure CoP NWs, and the average fluorescence lifetime of CoP monitored at 620 nm reduces from 4.36 to 4.11 ns. These PL phenomena of CoP imply the electron transfer from CoP to NGQDs in CoP/NGQDs NCs.
The above optical properties of CoP NWs and CoP/NGQDs NCs confirm the formation of CoP/NGQDs heterojunction and the existence of a built-in electric field in CoP/NGQDs NCs, which usually hinders the recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes in CoP/NGQDs NCs.40 Note that additional study of transient photocurrent response (TPR) in Fig. 3f shows that the photocurrent of CoP NWs is ∼0.4 μA and that of CoP/NGQDs NCs significantly increases to ∼1.6 μA. The TPR increase by four times proved that the formation of the CoP/NGQDs heterojunction indeed greatly promotes the photoelectric conversion. Besides, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on the samples was measured. The EIS of CoP/NGQDs NCs and CoP NWs are arc-shaped as shown in Fig. S7.† The former has a smaller radius than the latter, meaning smaller impedance in CoP/NGQDs NCs. Therefore, the combination of CoP molecules and NGQDs is helpful for a quick charge transfer.
The POE activity of CoP/NGQDs was examined in the 100 mL aqueous dispersion system, including 1 mg CoP/NGQDs NCs as photocatalyst and 10 mM AgNO3 as the electron acceptor under visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). In order to investigate the effect of NGQDs solid content in CoP/NGQDs NCs on the POE activity, different samples were synthesized by injecting 1 mL of 1 mM CoP·ClO4 solution into 5 mL of 10 mM FeSO4 aqueous solution, including 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12 and 0.15 mg mL−1 NGQDs. The typical structures of the as-obtained samples are shown in Fig. 2. The responding POE rate at the first two hours was measured, as shown in Fig. 4a. It is clear that the POE rate of CoP/NGQDs NCs increases with the disappearance of CoP NWs, however, subsequently, it decreases with a further increase of NGQDs solid content in CoP/NGQDs NCs. Here, the optimal content of NGQDs is 0.09 mg mL−1, and the POE rate is 350 μmol g−1 h−1, as shown in Fig. 4b. It is also the highest POE rate on the molecule so far for the nanocatalytic systems (see Table S1†). After 2 hours, the POE rate slowed down because most of Ag+ was reduced to Ag NPs, and then gradually covered the active sites on the catalyst surface.41 It is also a universal phenomenon in the POE process with Ag+ as the electron acceptor. However, when the physical mixture of CoP NWs and NGQDs was used as a catalyst, no detectable oxygen molecule was generated under the same condition. It means that the as-synthesized CoP NWs and NGQDs do not have the obvious POE activity, and NGQDs should play an important role in the POE of CoP/NGQDs NCs via certain synergistic effects. Moreover, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of CoP/NGQDs NCs was also measured, using low power light with wavelengths of 420, 450, 500 and 550 nm. As shown in Fig. 4c, the AQE of CoP/NGQDs NCs is in accordance with its UV-vis absorption spectrum, and the largest AQE is 0.23% at 420 nm. The POE stability of CoP/NGQDs was also checked by cycling experiments as shown in Fig. 4d. The POE rate did not exhibit a significant decrease after three cycles, meaning good photocatalysis and structure stability of CoP/NGQDs composites.

(b) POE time course of CoP/NGQDs NCs and the mixture of CoP NWs and NGQDs. (c) AQE at different wavelengths and (d) POE cycle experiments of CoP/NGQDs NCs. 
To further validate the stability of CoP/NGQDs during POE, the sample after the POE test was characterized by SEM, FT-IR and XPS again. As shown in Fig. S8,† the morphology of nanoparticles was unchanged, although they are apt for aggregation after the POE process. No obvious change in Fig. S9† could be found in FT-IR spectra before/after photocatalysis, indicating a close combination of CoP and NGQDs. Moreover, the high-resolution XPS spectra in Fig. S10a–c† exhibit the components and binding energy of N 1s, O 1s and Co 2p did not change. However, a few Ag0 from the reduction of AgNO3 may be also found as shown in Fig. S10d† after the POE test. The above experimental results confirm that the morphology, component and structure of CoP/NGQDs are maintained during the harsh POE process, suggesting excellent stability of CoP/NGQDs.
3.3 POE mechanism of CoP/NGQDs NCs
To further understand the POE mechanism of CoP NWs and CoP/NGQDs NCs, their energy levels, structures, components and charge transfer were measured and deeply analyzed. As we know, the energy level of the semiconductor must meet with the redox potential of H2O for photocatalytic water splitting. In our experiments, the energy band structures of CoP and NGQDs were determined via the measurement of solid UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. S11a and b†) and Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots (Fig. S11c and d†). Obviously, NGQDs powder has wide absorption in the visible-near-infrared region, and the absorption of CoP/NGQDs NCs is enhanced in the wavelength range of 550–800 nm as compared to that of pure CoP NWs. The band gap (Eg) of NGQDs is 1.3 eV obtained by transforming the absorption spectra using Tauc's method (inset in Fig. S11a†). Similarly, the band gap of CoP is 1.92 eV, as shown in the inset of Fig. S11b.† The positive slopes of M–S plots in Figs. S11c and d† indicate that the as-prepared NGQDs and CoP NWs are n-type semiconductors. By extrapolating these lines to the X intercepts in M–S plots, the flat band potentials (EFB) of NGQDs and CoP NWs are calculated to be −0.55 and −0.42 V vs. RHE. It was reported that the conduction bands of n-type semiconductors are normally 0.1–0.2 eV deeper than the flat band potential.42 Here we use a value of 0.1 eV, indicating the conduction band potentials (ECB) of NGQDs and CoP NWs are about −0.65 and −0.52 V vs. RHE, respectively. Based on the formula of EVB = ECB + Eg, the valence band (EVB) of NGQDs and CoP should be 0.65 and 1.4 V vs. RHE, respectively. Fig. 5a shows the energy level structure of CoP/NGQDs. Here, only CoP EVB is thermodynamically suitable for the POE reaction via the four-electron process of water oxidation (>1.23 V), confirming that the CoP molecule should be the catalytic centre in CoP/NGQDs NCs. Because the transfer of photogenerated-electrons from CoP to NGQDs has been confirmed, the as-obtained CoP/NGQDs NCs are actually a typical Z-scheme heterostructure in which the excited electrons in CoP recombine with holes in NGQDs.

However, the match of energy level with water splitting is the only thermodynamical requirement for POE. Generally, the central metal atoms in MP molecules act as active sites.10,18 Especially, when the Co atom is axially coordinated with H2O and Cl atom, the axial atom is beneficial not only for the adsorption of H2O molecules through the H-bond but also the oxidation of H2O due to the high valence state in theory. Therefore, enough exposure of the CoP axial atom should be a key for water splitting. Unfortunately, the CoP NWs mainly grow along the axial direction through strong intermolecular π–π and H-bond (e.g. Cl⋯H–O–H) interactions, as shown in Fig. 1f. This should be the main reason why the CoP NWs and their physical mixture with NGQDs have no detectable POE activity. Owing to the abundant –OH, –COOH groups and π electrons as well as the larger size of NGQDs than that of the CoP molecule, the CoP molecules may tend to adsorb on the surface of NGQDs through stronger π–π and H-bond interactions under a low monomer concentration at the nucleation stage. It easily leads to the disappearance of CoP NWs and the full exposure of CoP axial atoms. Here, NGQDs actually act as both template/capping agent and dopant. The decrease of the POE rate with further increase of NGQDs may be attributed to the coverage of CoP active sites in CoP/NGQDs NCs.
To investigate the electron transfer between CoP and NGQDs, femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectra of CoP NWs, NGQDs and CoP/NGQDs NCs were recorded upon excitation of 400 nm laser light (see Fig. 5b–d). The detailed experimental process can be found in the ESI.† Here, the intramolecular electron transit (ET) is not drawn, which is the intersystem crossing (ISC) ET from the ligand to metal (S1 → T1). In addition to a negative fsTA peak of CoP NWs at 535 nm in Fig. 5b, derived from ground-state bleaching (GB) absorption of the CoP Q band, other positive peaks may be attributed to the excited state absorption (ESA). The only ESA peak at 485 nm was observed within ∼250 fs and can be easily assigned to the π*-electron absorption of porphyrin rings (PR), i.e., ET of S1 → S2. Thereafter (>250 fs), the peak at 485 nm disappears with the immediate generation of fsTA peaks at 458, 500, 535 and 560 nm, which survives at least 1 ns, thus indicating the de-excitation or other ET of S1 excited electrons due to the existence of the lower energy levels of the intermolecular charge transfer state and LMCT state. As shown in UV-vis spectra in Fig. 3d, the peak at 458 nm, which is similar to the absorption of CoP aggregate ascribed to the ET of S0 → CT, should be from the fast deexcitation of S1 electrons to the CT state of excimer (PR·PR)*. The 500 nm peak is derived from the ET from CT to CT* (PR+·PR−) state. The GB peak at 535 nm should be ground-state bleaching (GB) of the CoP Q band, indicating the initial occurrence of ET from ligand PR to metal Co atom (PR → Co LMCT state) and the ISC ET from the excited singlet state (S1) to triplet state (T1). In addition, within the 200–800 fs in the fsTA spectra, the peak at 500 nm is stronger than the peak at 458 nm with almost no change; however, it gradually weakens with the enhancement of the GB peak at 535 nm in the range of 400–800 fs. This phenomenon suggests the ET from CT* (PR+·PR−) state to T1 (Co). Therefore, the peak at 500 nm may be seen as the indicator of PR+ positive ions. With the appearance of fsTA peaks at 458, 500 and 535 nm, the triplet state ESA of CoP from 550 to 750 nm may be observed in situ after the occurrence of ISC. Among them, the peak at 560 nm first arises and should be from the ET of T0 → T1. Subsequently, the ESA peak at 625 nm gradually rises, which may be from the ET of T1 → T2. According to UV-vis and PL as well as the fsTA spectra of CoP NWs, the energy level diagrams of electron transition (ET) in Fig. 6a can be speculated on the basis of nonlinear absorption of the CoP molecule.43

However, there are five obvious differences in fsTA spectra of CoP NWs and CoP/NGQDs heterojunction (Fig. 5b and c). (1) Compared with those of CoP NWs, both BG and ESA peaks red-shift, strongly indicating the existence of their interaction and ET between CoP and NGQDs. (2) For CoP/NGQDs NCs, the positions of fsTA peaks only shift slightly with the monitor time compared with those of NGQDs (Fig. S12†). (3) The generation of the GB peak delays from 200 to 270 fs. (4) The lifetime of the ESA peak of PR+ indicator at ∼500 nm obviously becomes longer in the CoP/NGQDs heterojunction. As shown in Fig. 5d, the charge recombination lifetime of PR+ in CoP/NGQDs is fitted to be 87.8 ps, which is almost three-time longer than that in pure CoP NWs (32.2 ps). (5) Within the whole lifetime, the ESA peak at ∼500 nm is seemingly stronger than the 470 nm one, which is almost kept unchanged for 800 fs. Combining the above phenomena with the change of UV-vis absorption of CoP/NGQDs NCs shown in Fig. 3d, the ET diagram in CoP/NGQDs NCs can be proposed, as shown in Fig. 6b. In CoP/NGQDs NCs, ET should first occur from PR (π*) to NGQDs (π) energy level rather than from PR (π*) to Co, and the CoP+·NGQD− forms like an exciplex. The peak at ∼470 nm may be attributed to the ET of PR (π) → CoP+·NGQD−. In addition, it can be found that the ESA of triplex state enhances in CoP/NGQDs NCs than that in pure CoP after 1 ps. This indicates that the partial electrons of NGQDs (S1 sate, π*) may finally transit to the Co atoms (T1 state) without the electron acceptor AgNO3. In general, the more existence of PR+ intermediate with a longer lifetime in CoP/NGQDs NCs is a key to achieve the highly efficient CoP-based POE.
As a result, more central Co atoms with higher valence state (CoIV, even CoV) should exist in the intermediates of excited CoP/NGQDs NCs when AgNO3 acts as the sacrificial agent.11,12 Theoretically, the resultant CoP with the good hydrophilicity due to the presence of Co axial coordination with water will be very helpful for the POE process.11 In light of reported works on CoP-based and Co-based catalysis in the acid condition for OER,12,44–46 the POE mechanism of Cl–Co(III)·H2O in CoP/NGQDs Z-scheme heterojunction may mainly occur via the four-steps and four-electron process in the acid heterogeneous system (pH = 5.0), as summarized in Fig. 7. (1) Under light irradiation and build-in electric field, the electron transfer from CoP to NGQDs and finally to AgNO3 results in the generation of intermediate Cl–Co(IV)–OH, (2) and then Cl–Co(V)O due to further oxidation of the Co atom. (3) The strong electrophilic ability of Co(V) induces the chemical adsorption and oxidation of OH− ions in H2O to form the intermediate Cl–Co(IV)–O–OH2, and then Cl–Co(IV)–O–O. (4) Side-on superoxide species is unstable and quickly transforms into the oxygen molecule, and Co(IV) is reduced to Co(III) with the adsorption of one water molecule.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have been successfully synthesized the axially coordinated CoP NWs and 0D CoP/NGQDs NCs through a simple wet chemical method for the first time. The in situ effect of NGQDs on the self-assembly of CoP molecules was observed, confirming the role of NGQDs as a template and dopant. Under the visible-light irradiation, CoP NWs have no POE activity, while the currently highest POE rate of 350 μmol g−1 h−1 on molecule may be achieved in the heterogeneous system, including CoP/NGQDs NCs and AgNO3. The systematic characterizations sufficiently proved that the formation of CoP/NGQDs Z-scheme heterojunction and the limited self-assembly of CoP molecules along the axial direction are the keys for POE due to the appearance of a new excited state of (CoP+·NGQDs−)*. This work provides a new idea to efficiently realize the POE on molecule semiconductors in a nanocatalytic system for artificial photocatalysis.
