    , Accepted 12th April 2019First published on 12th April 2019AbstractCuWO4 is an n-type oxide semiconductor with a bandgap of 2.2 eV which exhibits great potential for photoelectrochemical (PEC) conversion of solar energy into chemical fuels. However, the photocurrent achieved so far is limited to ∼0.3 mA cm−2 at +1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Possible limiting factors include slow surface reaction kinetics, poor charge carrier mobility and/or presence of surface defect states. A detailed understanding of the fundamental electronic structure and its correlation with PEC activity is of significant importance for devising strategies for further improvements. In this work, we have synthesized CuWO4 thin films showing a record photocurrent density of 0.50 mA cm−2 at +1.23 V vs. RHE. Importantly, we have used a synergistic combination of photoemission spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) to unravel the electronic structure of CuWO4. Our results show that the valence band (VB) consists of strongly hybridized states of O 2p6 and Cu 3d9, while the bottom of the conduction band (CB) is primarily composed of unoccupied Cu 3d states. The localized nature of the Cu 3d state leads to the low charge carrier mobility and the localization of the photo-excited electrons to the CB. The combined experimental and theoretical results also indicate that CuWO4 is better described as having a direct but d–d forbidden optical bandgap, leading to a low absorption coefficient for visible light. Furthermore, the implication of the electronic structure on its PEC characteristics and strategies for further improvements by adding Co3O4 as a co-catalyst or surface layer to increase the interfacial band bending to facilitate photo-carriers transport, are discussed.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting provides a promising pathway to store solar energy in chemical bonds and has potential for solving global energy and environmental issues.1,2 The key challenge of PEC technologies is to develop semiconductor materials which must meet a series of stringent requirements, such as a suitable bandgap (2.0–2.4 eV) for visible light harvesting, facile surface reaction kinetics, earth-abundance and superior stability in electrolyte during PEC processes.3,4 Over the past few decades, a variety of binary oxides such as TiO2,5 Fe2O3 (ref. 6) and WO3 (ref. 7) have been explored, but these have been found to exhibit only moderate PEC activity due to their inherent material properties; for example, TiO2 and WO3 have too large bandgaps (>2.8 eV) and can only utilize a small portion of the solar spectrum;8 α-Fe2O3 has a suitable bandgap (2.2 eV), but is limited by its low charge carrier mobility. Owing to the limitations of binary oxides, recent efforts have turned towards ternary oxides, because they offer more flexibility in terms of tailoring both structure and composition, and thereby optimizing the optical, electronic and catalytic properties.9 From the perspective of electronic structure, the bandgap of d0 binary oxides is usually dictated by transitions between O 2p (valence band) and metal d states (conduction band). The localized nature of the O 2p-derived valence band (VB) leads to a large hole effective mass, and thus low carrier mobility.10 Incorporating occupied transition metal d orbitals or post-transition metal ns2 lone pair states could introduce more occupied states hybridized with O 2p6 and raise the energy position of VB to lower the bandgap for enhancing visible light absorption.11,12 Moreover, a strong hybridization at the VB could also enables additional pathways to increase the charge carrier mobility. A representative example is bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) with a bandgap Eg = 2.5 eV and an impressive 6.72 mA cm−2 photocurrent density under 1 sun illumination at +1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).13
Recently, CuWO4 has been receiving considerable attention as another candidate.14 It has a moderate bandgap of 2.2 eV, giving rise to a theoretical maximum photocurrent density of 10.7 mA cm−2 at +1.23 V vs. RHE.9,15 Several groups have investigated CuWO4 thin films prepared by different methods including electrodeposition,16 hydrothermal,17 spin-coating,18 sputtering deposition,19 atomic layer deposition,20 and attempted to optimize their PEC performances via strategies including doping, loading of co-catalysts or forming p–n heterojunctions.21,22 Nevertheless, most of these studies have reported low photocurrent densities in the range of 0.1–0.3 mA cm−2 at the thermodynamic potential of water oxidation.14,23 Such limited performance has been attributed to sluggish water oxidation kinetics, low electronic conductivity, indirect bandgap, and/or the presence of a midgap electronic state on the CuWO4 surface.24
There are very limited works devoted to understanding the fundamental electronic structure of CuWO4 in spite of its paramount importance to PEC performance.25 A detailed knowledge of the relationship of the electronic structure with PEC activity is essential to provide rational guidance for devising strategies for enhancing PEC performance.14,26 CuWO4 crystallizes in a distorted wolframite-type structure, as shown in Fig. 1a. Both the Cu2+ (3d9) and W6+ (4d0) cations are in distorted octahedral coordination with O2− ions (O 2p6). The distortion of oxygen octahedron is induced by the Jahn–Teller effect in Cu2+ which further breaks the degeneracy of the Cu 3d t2g and eg orbitals. Because the energy level of the Cu 3d orbitals is close to that of O 2p6, there is a consensus from both experiment and theory that a strongly hybridized state of Cu 3d–O 2p contributes to the top of the VB of CuWO4. However, there are conflicting reports regarding the nature of the conduction band (CB). The CB minimum was initially believed to be composed of W (5d) orbitals based on DFT, photoemission and PEC measurements.27,28 However, recent ab initio calculations suggest that the bottom of the CB is composed primarily of hybridized Cu 3d and O 2p states.25 In addition, a midgap electronic state has been observed on the surface of CuWO4 by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.23 It was reported that such midgap states determine the hole transfer rate for water oxidization. However, it is elusive whether the mid-gap state is resulting from intrinsic Cu 3d states or photo-induced water oxidation intermediate species.14

Motivated by the promise of CuWO4 for PEC water splitting and to answer the aforementioned fundamental questions, this work aims to provide a detailed understanding of the optical and electronic structure of CuWO4 thin films for enhanced PEC water splitting. To this end, we synthesized high-quality CuWO4 thin films using spin-coating method. By optimizing the growth conditions, we achieved a record photocurrent density of 0.50 mA cm−2 at +1.23 V vs. RHE. The electronic structures of the CuWO4 films were studied by a combination of high-resolution X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory (DFT). Our results reveal that the VB of CuWO4 consists of strongly hybridized states of O 2p6 and Cu 3d9, whereas the conduction band minimum (CBM) is primarily composed of Cu 3d states (Fig. 1b). We show that the localized nature of the Cu 3d state is responsible for the low charge carrier mobility and also mid-gap state under photoreduction. DFT calculations indicate that the optical bandgap of CuWO4 is better described as direct but d–d forbidden, explaining the reported low absorption coefficients at the visible region. Furthermore, the implication of the electronic structure on its PEC behavior and strategies for improvements using surface modification by Co3O4 layer are discussed.
2. Experimental and computational details
2.1. Synthesis of CuWO4 thin films and Co3O4 ultra-thin layers
The CuWO4 films were synthesized using spin-coating method on F-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (1 × 1 cm2). Firstly, 1 mmol Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (Alfa, purity > 99.99%) and 1 mmol (NH4)6W12O39·xH2O (Alfa, 99%) were dissolved in 1 mL deionized (DI) water and 1 mmol citric acid (Alfa, 99.5%) was added. The solution was diluted with 0.5 mL of 2-methoxy ethanol (Alfa, 99%) or ethanol and stirred for 10 minutes to form a green solution. 30 μL green precursor was dropped on FTO substrates and spun for 30 seconds at 3000 rpm. The FTO (TEC 7–10 ohm sq.−1) substrates were cleaned by ultrasonicating in acetone and ethanol for 30 minutes and then dried with nitrogen. After each coating, the sample was annealed at 300 °C for 5 minutes in a tube furnace to evaporate organics. This cycle was repeated to achieve the required thickness. Finally, the films were annealed in air at different temperatures of 450 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C and 600 °C for 2 hours in a tube furnace. Ultra-thin Co3O4 films (1.5 nm, 3 nm thick) were deposited onto CuWO4 by RF magnetron sputtering using a Co3O4 target. The Co3O4 target was prepared by high purity Co3O4 (Alfa, 99.99%) pelletized and heated in air at 1100 °C for 24 hours. The sputtering was carried out at 20 W power with 450 °C substrate temperature in 5 Pa argon pressure.
2.2. Materials characterization
The crystal structure of the CuWO4 thin films was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation generated at 40 kV and 44 mA. Rietveld refinement (GSAS software and EXPGUI interface) were used to determine lattice parameters. Thin film morphology and thickness were examined by scanning electron microscope (ZEISS Sigma). UV-visible spectra of CuWO4 was measured using a PerkinElmer Lamda 900 spectrometer, with an integrating sphere 13 over the range from 250–1400 nm.
Laboratory-based XPS was carried out at normal emission using a monochromatic Al Kα1 X-ray (hν = 1486.6 eV). The total energy resolution was about 0.50 eV. The binding energy (BE) was calibrated using a polycrystalline Au foil placed in electric contact with the film surface after deposition, which simultaneously helped to avoid charging effects during XPS measurements. Soft X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and XAS measurements were performed at the Soft X-ray Spectroscopy Beamline of the Australian Synchrotron. Photon energy calibration was performed using Au 4f from Au foils measured in parallel with the data. The XAS measurements at the O K-edge were performed in total fluorescence yield mode using linearly polarized X-rays.
2.3. Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a PEC cell with three-electrode configuration using a CH Instruments 750E and Autolab potentiostat. The three electrodes include an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, platinum electrode and CuWO4 working electrode. The measurements were performed in 0.1 M potassium phosphate (KPi) buffer at pH = 7 which has been purged with N2 for 30 minutes. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was measured at 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) simulated light in the pH = 7 KPi buffer, with an applied potential from 0 V to +1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. A light meter was used to calibrate the light intensity on the working electrode. To study the reaction kinetics at the CuWO4/electrolyte interface, 0.1 M Na2SO3 (Alfa, 99%) was added as hole scavenger for LSV test.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out in the pH = 7 KPi buffer with frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz at different applied potentials using an Autolab electrochemical workstation. Mott–Schottky analysis was performed to determine the flat band potential and carrier concentration using 2, 5, 10 kHz frequencies at bias potentials from 0 V to +1.0 V vs. RHE.
2.4. Computational methods
All the calculations were carried out with the density functional theory (DFT) framework using the projector augmented wave method, as implemented in Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP).29 Projector augmented-wave pseudopotentials were used to describe the interaction between ions and electrons, the exchange–correlation potential was described by the generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) parameterization.30 The electronic configurations for the PAW potentials were 4s13d10 for Cu, 2s22p4 for O and 6s15d5 for W. It was known that DFT underestimates the bandgap, thus the electronic structure of CuWO4 was also calculated by the DFT method plus Hubbard U correction (U = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 eV) and the hybrid DFT in the framework of Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE).31 The optimization calculations were performed with a 5 × 4 × 5 k-points sampling and a cutoff energy of 800 eV. The convergence criteria for total energies and forces were 10−5 eV and 10−5 eV Å−1. The bandstructure of CuWO4 along high symmetric k-points B (0.5, 0, 0) – Γ (0, 0, 0) – F (0, 0.5, 0) – Q (0, 0.5, 0.5) – G (0, 0, 0.5) in the first Brillouin zone was then calculated.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Thin film synthesis and optical properties
The CuWO4 thin films were prepared using spin-coating method on FTO. We performed a detailed study on the effects of annealing temperatures and film thickness on the crystalline structure and PEC activity of the resultant films. XRD results indicate that the crystalline phase of CuWO4 starts to form at temperatures above 450 °C (ESI Fig. S1†). Increasing annealing temperatures improves the crystallinity, but a temperature above 650 °C deteriorates it, probably due to the thermal deformation of the FTO/glass substrates. The PEC measurements suggest that a 500 nm film annealed at 550 °C exhibits the highest PEC activity (ESI Fig. S2†). Thus, this film was chosen for further detailed study by photoelectrochemistry, optical and electronic structure measurements. Fig. 1c shows XRD pattern of the 550 °C annealed film, together with bulk CuWO4 powder as a reference. The film exhibits all of the characteristic peaks of bulk CuWO4. The lattice parameters extracted by Rietveld refinement are a = 4.69 Å, b = 5.83 Å, c = 4.87 Å, α = 91.84°, β = 92.54°, γ = 82.68°, close to those of the powder reference. SEM images shown in Fig. 1d indicate that CuWO4 forms dense films consisting of homogeneous grains with lateral sizes of 200–500 nm.

Fig. 2a shows the optical properties of the 500 nm thick CuWO4 thin film, showing an onset of strong absorption at 500 nm and a weak absorption feature at ∼850 nm. Using Tauc analysis (inset in Fig. 2b), the absorption onset at 2.2 eV is assigned to an indirect bandgap, as previously reported in the literature.9 A weak absorption feature (α < 2 × 104 cm−1) is also observed between 1–2 eV. We argue that the weak feature arises from localized ligand field d–d transition in the Cu2+ (3d9) cations, and thus does not generate mobile charge carriers. We will revisit this argument later based on electronic structure characterizations. Similar phenomenon have been observed in many other transition metal oxides with partially filled d orbitals, such as the Cu2+-containing oxides CuO and γ-Cu3V2O8.32

3.2. Photoelectrochemical properties
The PEC measurements were carried out in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH = 7) under simulated AM 1.5G at 100 mW cm−2 intensity. Fig. 3a (black curve) shows the current density vs. applied electrochemical potential (j–V) response under chopped illumination. The CuWO4 photoanode produces a photocurrent density of 0.50 mA cm−2 at an applied bias of +1.23 V vs. RHE, and the onset potential for water oxidation is ∼+0.75 V vs. RHE. This photocurrent density is much higher than the values reported for pristine CuWO4 in the literatures which are typically in the range of 0.1–0.3 mA cm−2 (Table 1). The considerably improved PEC performance is likely due to the higher crystalline quality of our films by optimization of the growth conditions.

Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 3b, the chopped photocurrent shows transient spikes near the onset regions, which are presumably caused by high rate surface recombination and/or sluggish water oxidation kinetics at the CuWO4/electrolyte interface.33 To further investigate the surface reaction kinetics, 0.1 M Na2SO3 was added in the electrolyte as a sacrificial hole scavenger. Na2SO3 has fast oxidation kinetics and has been shown to produce quantitative hole collection for CuWO4.20,34 With Na2SO3, the photocurrent density (red curve) is significantly increased up to 1.0 mA cm−2 at +1.23 V vs. RHE and the onset potential was shifted cathodically to +0.45 V vs. RHE. The transient photocurrent spikes also become negligible upon addition of Na2SO3 (Fig. 3b), suggesting that surface recombination is nearly suppressed. Nevertheless, the achieved photocurrent is still much smaller than the theoretical limit of 10.7 mA cm−2 at +1.23 V vs. RHE.14 This indicates that poor charge carrier separation and transport in the bulk of the film severely limits the overall performance of CuWO4.
Mott–Schottky (M–S) measurements were performed to determine the flat-band potential and carrier concentration in the CuWO4 film. The M–S relation is given below:  where Csc is the total capacitance in the space-charge depletion layer, ε0 is permittivity in vacuum, εr is the relative permittivity of CuWO4 (εr = 83),35A is the surface area of the electrode, E is the applied potential, Efb is the flat-band potential, ND is the majority carrier density, and T is temperature. Efb is determined from the x-intercept of the plot 1/(Csc2) versus E, Efb = E0 − (kT/e) and the majority-carrier density is calculated from the slope, where ND = (2/e0ε0εr)(d(1/Csc2)/dE)−1. As shown in Fig. 3c, the M–S plots at three different frequencies show negative slope, confirming the n-type character of CuWO4. The M–S plots show a slight frequency dependent slope but converge to an identical intercept with the applied potential, giving rise to a flat-band potential of +0.30 V vs. RHE. This value is smaller than the flat-band potential (+0.40 V vs. RHE) reported by Bartlett et al.23 The more negative flat-band potential in our films explains the lower onset potential and higher photocurrent for water oxidation.
The slopes of the M–S plots reveal the electron density is in the range of ∼1019 cm−3. This value is comparable to that measured in single crystals,36 but much lower than the value (1021 cm−3) reported by Bartlett et al.9 The difference between the Fermi level (EF) and the CBM can be estimated with the expression: ND = NCexp(−(EC − EF)/kT). Assuming CuWO4 has an effective density of states (NC) in the CB of 5 × 1019 cm−3, this results in the EF positioned 0.15 eV below the CBM. This is in good agreement with our XPS measurements presented in next section, showing the EF is located 0.1 eV below the CBM. In contrast, a carrier density of 1021 cm−3 would position the EF at 0.3 eV above the CBM, i.e., degenerately doped semiconductor, which is not the case from the XPS measurement and is also reflected by the low electrical conductivity of our CuWO4 film. The stability of the CuWO4 photoanode was also evaluated using chronoamperometry at applied potential of +1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 intensity. As shown in Fig. 3d, there is a slight decrease of photocurrent density from 0.48 to 0.40 mA cm−2 for the first two hours, but is stable for up to 10 hours. Comparison characterizations by XPS and XRD for the CuWO4 photoanode before and after stability test suggest the materials maintain the same crystalline phases and electronic structures (ESI Fig. S4†).
3.3. Electronic structure
A comprehensive combination of high-resolution XPS, XAS and DFT calculations was used to study the electronic structure of CuWO4. Fig. 4a shows high-resolution Cu 2p core level spectra for CuWO4 together with CuO and Cu2O as references. The Cu 2p for CuWO4 displays the characteristic features of Cu2+: the spin–orbit doublets located at 934 eV and 954 eV corresponding to Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, and a pronounced shake-up satellite at 940–946 eV arising from electron-correlation effects in the open Cu 3d shell (3d9). In contrast, the 3d shell of Cu2O (Cu+) is fully filled (3d10), and therefore the Cu 2p core line for Cu2O does not show any satellite peak.37 The W 4f core-level spectrum shown in Fig. 4b is composed of a well-resolved W 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 doublet, in agreement with the W6+ oxidation state.38
 Fig. 4  (a) Cu 2p, (b) W 4f, and (c) valence band spectra of CuWO4 (red), CuO (grey) and Cu2O (blue) excited with photon energy of 1486 eV; (d) O K-edge XAS spectra of CuWO4 (red) and CuO (grey). 

Fig. 4c and d show the experimental determination of occupied and unoccupied density of states obtained by XPS VB spectra and O K-edge XAS, respectively. The XPS VB measures the occupied density of states weighted by cross sections of the contributing orbitals, whilst the O K-edge XAS probes the electronic transitions from the O 1s core level to unoccupied states with partial O 2p character hybridized with Cu 3d and W 5d states. The spectra can be qualitatively related to the density of states in the CB. Therefore, to a first approximation, the combination of XPS VB and O K-edge XAS can be used to directly examine the electronic structure near Fermi level.39–41 The VB spectrum for CuWO4 together with that of CuO for comparison is shown in Fig. 4c. The VB maximum (VBM) of CuWO4 is located at 2.1 eV below the EF as determined by linear extrapolation of the leading edge of the VB to zero baseline intensity, further confirming the n-type character of CuWO4. Considering the measured optical band gap of 2.2 eV, the EF is located at 0.1 eV below the CBM, which is in agreement with the EF position estimated by carrier concentration obtained from M–S analysis. On the other hand, the O K-edge XAS of CuWO4 in Fig. 4d shows a broad feature at 530.5 eV with a shoulder at lower energy side. By comparing with the spectra for CuO and WO3, we tentatively assign the additional unoccupied states at the edge onset in the O K-edge to be Cu 3d states at the bottom of CB.
To gain a deeper understanding of XPS VB and O K-edge XAS spectra, we employed standard DFT, DFT+U (U = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 eV) and hybrid DFT methods to calculate the electronic structures of CuWO4. Table 2 summarizes the calculated lattice parameters and bandgap of CuWO4, and Fig. 5 present calculated bandstructures and projected density of states (PDOS). For all calculation methods, there is fairly good agreement for lattice parameters between calculations and experimental data.36,42,43 However, for DFT (Fig. 5a) and DFT+U with the maximum U = 6 eV (Fig. 5b), the resultant bandgaps are 0.18 eV and ∼0.60 eV respectively, which are much smaller than the experimental value of ∼2.2 eV.36 On the other hand, hybrid DFT (Fig. 5c) results in an indirect band gap of 2.35 eV, in agreement with the experimental value. Therefore, we believe that hybrid DFT provide more accurate description for the electronic structure of CuWO4. The calculated VB is mainly composed of strongly hybridized states of Cu 3d and O 2p orbitals. This is in good agreement with recent ab initio calculations.25 The strong Cu 3d and O 2p hybridization raise the energy position of the VBM and shrinks the band gap of CuWO4 which improves visible light absorption. It is worthwhile to note that the strong hybridization of Cu 3d and O 2p also increases the dispersion at the VBM, and thus provide a way to reduce the effective mass of the hole carriers thereby increasing hole mobility.12

 Fig. 5  Bandstructures (left panel) and projected density of states (right panel) of CuWO4 calculated by (a) DFT; (b) DFT+U (U = 6 eV), and (c) hybrid DFT. 
The bottom of the CB is composed mainly of empty Cu 3d eg state hybridized with the O 2p. It can be seen that the energy position of the empty Cu 3d eg, which determines the band gaps, strongly depends on the calculation methods employed. However, all calculation methods suggest that the empty W 5d (t2g) states have higher energy than Cu 3d eg sub-band. To further verify the fundamental electronic structure, we directly compare our experimental XPS/XAS spectra to the corresponding hybrid DFT calculated PDOS in Fig. 6. In order to put the XPS and XAS in a common scale, we shifted the spectra to set the VBM as zero, and the bottom of XAS to be value of band gap (2.2 eV), as shown in Fig. 6. This confirms Cu 3d character of the CBM and strongly mixed O 2p/Cu 3d character of the VBM, consistent with our XPS/XAS spectra. Taken together, by combining the experimental results from optical spectroscopy, XPS, XAS and hybrid DFT calculations, a schematic summary of the near band-edge electronic structure is proposed in Fig. 7. It can be found that the VBM is of strongly hybridized O 2p and Cu 3d character. The unoccupied 3d eg state of Cu2+ dominate the CBM, while the W6+ 5d state is at higher energies within the CB.

Furthermore, our results also reveal more insight regarding the optical absorption spectra of CuWO4. The weak optical absorption coefficient of CuWO4 (between 1 to 2 eV) has been argued to be due to its indirect band gap. However, our band structure calculations shown in Fig. 5 do not show large dispersion at both VBM and CBM. Since the lowest optical absorption arises from transition from the VBM of mixed O 2p/Cu 3d orbitals to the empty Cu 3d eg state, our results suggest that the weak excitation features below 2 eV is most probably due to a low cross-section of the Cu 3d eg state and a dipole forbidden inter d–d transition.
3.4. Electronic structures under light illumination
Additional insight into the electronic structure of CuWO4 can be obtained by comparing XPS data collected in darkness and under light illumination. Fig. 8a–c comparatively show XPS core level spectra in the Cu 2p3/2 and W 4f regions of CuWO4 in dark and under illumination with a 455 nm LED (2.72 eV, 40 mW cm−2). Two changes to the photoemission spectra can be observed upon illumination of the sample: (i) there is a 0.1 eV shift of the core levels to higher binding energy (BE), which can be easily observed in the W 4f core line (see Fig. 8c); (ii) the Cu 2p3/2 core level now shows an additional shoulder at lower BE attributed to a Cu+ oxidation state. The observation of Cu+ is consistent with the scenario that the CBM is composed of localized Cu 3d states, in which the photoexcited electrons are localized in Cu 3d orbitals, leading to a reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+. A similar oxidation state change from Cu2+ to Cu+ under illumination has been previously reported for γ-Cu3V2O8, whose CBM is mainly composed of Cu 3d states.32 On the other hand, there is no lineshape change for W 4f (Fig. 8c) under illumination that might suggest any change in the oxidation state of the cation. The high BE shift may be associated to a surface photovoltage (SPV), which is the change in surface potential induced by the redistribution of photogenerated electron–hole pairs within the space charge region (SCR). XPS is sensitive to the surface potential, which provides a relatively easy means to study SPV by simply monitoring the shift of the photoelectron peaks position upon in situ illumination of the samples.44 In the case of n-type semiconductors such as the CuWO4 samples prepared in this work, the accumulation of holes at the surface decreases the surface potential, resulting in an increase of the BE of the core lines observed.
 Fig. 8  (a and b) Cu 2p3/2 core level spectra in the dark and under 455 nm LED illumination, showing an additional shoulder associated with a Cu+ state; (c) W 4f in the dark and under illumination; (d)–(f) Cu 2p3/2, VB and W 4f spectra after irradiation by intense synchrotron X-ray beam (hν = 1600 eV) with different exposure cycles; each cycle corresponds to a period of 100 seconds. 
Interestingly, we found that exposure to intense synchrotron X-ray radiation can also induce the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+. As shown in Fig. 8d, with progressive exposure time, more intensity related to a Cu+ state is produced at the lower binding energy side of Cu 2p3/2, while no detectable change for W 4f was observed (Fig. 8f). Meanwhile, the high-resolution VB spectra shown in Fig. 8e indicate an in-gap state (marked as IS) concurrently appears at 1.5 eV below EF. The intensity of the in-gap state has a strong correlation with the amount of Cu+. We speculate that the in-gap state is related to a localized Cu+ state, i.e., the occupation of CBM of Cu 3d character. This state is detrimental for PEC because it can become recombination centers for photogenerated carriers.
3.5. Enhancement of the PEC performance by Co3O4 surface modification
Our PEC measurements and previous reports indicate that fast surface charge recombination and poor bulk charge separation limit PEC water splitting efficiency of CuWO4. Surface modification with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is an effective approach to accelerate the reaction kinetics of water oxidation.45 To this end, we have deposited a thin layer of Co3O4 as an effective co-catalyst to enhance the PEC performance. Fig. 9a shows chopped light LSV plots of CuWO4 electrodes with different Co3O4 nominal thickness. It can be seen that the photocurrent density with 1.5 nm thick Co3O4 (denoted as 1.5-Co3O4/CuWO4) is improved to 0.57 mA cm−2 at +1.23 V vs. RHE. Moreover, the onset potential shows a cathodic shift of 100 mV, indicating enhanced charge separation efficiency in the low applied potential range. It should also be noted that further increase of Co3O4 thickness (e.g., 3 nm) leads to a decrease in PEC performance, probably due to the negative effect of Co3O4 such as a higher electrical resistance or formation of recombination centers at the Co3O4/CuWO4 interface.
 Fig. 9  (a) Chopped light LSV plots of CuWO4 (red), 1.5 nm Co3O4 (blue), and 3 nm Co3O4 (black) modified CuWO4; (b) Nyquist plots of the EIS data measured at +0.93 V vs. RHE; smaller semicircles indicate faster charge transfer rate at the CuWO4/electrolyte interface. 
EIS was used to further study the interfacial charge transfer kinetics. Shown in Fig. 9b, the EIS Nyquist plots of three samples can be simulated by the equivalent circuit shown in the inset, including series resistance (Rs), bulk capacitance (Cbulk) at the space charge region and charge transfer resistance (Rct). The diameter of the semicircle in the EIS curves reflects the electron transfer resistance (Rct), which can be used to compare the electron transfer kinetics at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface between different samples. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), a much smaller Rct is observed for the Co3O4/CuWO4 film, indicating an enhanced electron transfer kinetics at the Co3O4/CuWO4/electrolyte interface. Thus, Co3O4 can improve interfacial charge separation and increases water oxidization efficiency.
To understand the underlying mechanism of the Co3O4 layer for enhancing PEC performance, we used photoemission spectroscopy to study the electronic structure at the Co3O4/CuWO4 interface. First of all, the Co3O4 layer can server as an effective co-catalyst to enhance the kinetics of OER. As shown in Fig. 10a, with 1.5 nm thick Co3O4 loading on the CuWO4 surface, an additional electronic state appears in the energy region of 0.5–1.5 eV below the EF. This additional electronic state can be accordingly attributed to the occupied Co 3d states. It is well-known that the introduction of Co 3d states at the vicinity of EF can enhance the absorption energetics of reaction intermediates for enhanced OER.46–48
 Fig. 10  (a) Valence band spectra of CuWO4 (red) and 1.5 nm thick Co3O4 modified CuWO4 heterojunction (blue), showing the appearance of Co 3d state below the Fermi level (EF); (b) W 4f7/2 XPS spectra for CuWO4 in dark (black), under illumination (red) and Co3O4/CuWO4 under illumination (blue). (c) Schematic energy band diagram at the interfaces of water/CuWO4 and water/Co3O4/CuWO4; Co3O4 layer can serve as a co-catalyst, and also increase upward band bending of the CuWO4 (ΔΦ2 > ΔΦ1) for transport of charge carriers. 
Furthermore, in addition to being as a co-catalyst, our detailed spectroscopic study suggests that the Co3O4 surface modification can also increase upward band bending at the surface region of CuWO4. The increased upward band bending can facilitate the separation and transport of photogenerated holes to participate in water oxidation. This is because Co3O4 is a p-type material, and the contact of Co3O4 with CuWO4 lead to an upward band bending in CuWO4 due to electron depletion and a downward band bending in Co3O4 due to electron accumulation. Our previous results show that even 1.5 nm p-type NiO deposited on n-type perovskite SrTiO3 can induce ∼0.9 eV upward band bending.49,50 NiO has very similar p-type character as Co3O4. More interestingly, the upward band bending in CuWO4 triggers an increase of the SPV of the sample as measured by the shift of the W 4f peak upon illumination. Fig. 10b comparatively shows the changes of the W 4f core line upon illumination for bare CuWO4 and Co3O4/CuWO4. As indicated in the figure, the shift upon illumination goes from 0.10 eV in bare CuWO4 to 0.15 eV in Co3O4/CuWO4. This indicates that the Co3O4 modified CuWO4 photoanode possesses a larger SPV. As schematically illustrated in Fig. 10c, it is reasonable to expect that an increase in upward band bending brings about an increase of the diffusion length of photogenerated charge carriers, because there is a stronger electric field (ΔΦ2 > ΔΦ1) within the interface region for holes to move towards the surface and electrons to move into the bulk of the material via drift and diffusion. Similarly, previous works for Co3O4 nanoclusters modified BiVO4 (ref. 47) and Fe2O3,51 and transient absorption spectroscopic studies for CoPi on Fe2O3 and BiVO4 by Durrant et al.,52,53 suggest that the Co-based oxides not only serve as co-catalyst, but also induce a larger internal electrical field at the interface to facilitate charge carrier transport for water oxidization.
The electronic structure at the Co3O4/CuWO4 interface thus provides insight into the mechanisms responsible for the observed enhanced PEC activity. In addition to serving as co-catalyst for the kinetics of OER, our results also show the Co3O4 can increase the upward band bending at the interface of CuWO4. The larger band bending facilitate the separation of photogenerated excitons, driving more holes to the semiconductor–water interface for water oxidation. Moreover, our results indicate that the energy level of the Co 3d state is positioned at the VB of CuWO4; the Co 3d states effectively work as a reservoir for hole storage. We suggest that increasing the depth and magnitude of the band bending potential by optimizing the carrier concentration in CuWO4via doping would be an effective way to further improve the water splitting efficiency for this system.54
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized CuWO4 thin films using spin coating method. The CuWO4 photoanode shows record photocurrents up to 0.5 mA cm−2 at +1.23 V vs. RHE. Combined photoelectron spectroscopy, XAS and DFT calculations were used to study the electronic structure of CuWO4. Our results show that the VB consists of strongly hybridized states of O 2p6 and Cu 3d9, while the bottom of the CB is primarily composed of unoccupied Cu 3d states. Hybrid DFT calculations yield an accurate representation of the electronic, structural, and optical properties of CuWO4. The low photoactivity in CuWO4 is attributed to serious recombination of photo-generated carriers both in the bulk and at the interface between photoelectrode and electrolyte. The carrier recombination inside the material can be explained by the electronic structure of CuWO4: the VBM of CuWO4 is dominated by strongly localized O 2p states, which in turns localizes photo-generated holes; the CBM is also formed by localized Cu 3d state increasing therefore the recombination rate with electrons or other trap states. This issue could be solved by limiting the thickness of the CuWO4 layer by nanostructuring, or modifying the dispersion at the VB by doping, e.g., Cu doping. Finally, we have investigated loading the surface of our CuWO4 with a thin layer of Co3O4. Our detailed spectroscopic study indicate that the Co3O4 layer not only serve as an effective co-catalyst, but also can increase the upward band bending of the CuWO4, promoting the photogenerated holes to efficiently participate in the water oxidation reaction. These new findings on this efficient OER may also be used for other PEC systems for water oxidation reactions. Our work provides fundamental insights into how the electronic structure and optical properties of CuWO4 affect its photoelectrochemical characteristics and suggest feasible strategies for improving PEC performance.
