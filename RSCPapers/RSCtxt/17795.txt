    , Accepted 29th January 2019First published on 4th February 2019AbstractIn general, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of blade-coated polymer solar cells (PSCs) are low compared with those of spin-coated PSCs. In this study, a simple and effective vacuum-assisted annealing method has been developed to optimize the morphology of the blade-coated active layer processed by the same processing solvents as those used in spin coating. The blade-coated blend films are annealed with the assistance of a vacuum (∼10−1 Pa), and the corresponding device shows photovoltaic performance comparable to that of the devices fabricated by spin coating. The vacuum-assisted annealing method works well in blade coated PSCs based on a series of representative photoactive blend systems using the optimized solvents from the spin-coating method. For instance, for the blade-coated with the PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend film, the device exhibits a PCE of 13.6%, which is not only as good as the spin-coated device but also the highest value for the PSCs made by the blade coating method. More importantly, the vacuum-assisted annealing method can be successfully applied in fabricating a large-area device module with an active area of 12.6 cm2, and the device achieves a high PCE of 10.21%.
Introduction
As one of the prospective technologies for utilizing solar energy, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have gained considerable attention because of their advantages in making large area and flexible solar panels through low-cost printing techniques.1–3 In recent years, rapid progress has been made in PSCs by employing the donor–acceptor–donor (A–D–A)-type small molecules as electron acceptors and conjugated polymers as electron donors,4–6 and the state-of-the-art power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction and tandem PSCs have surpassed 14% and 17%, respectively.7–12 Spin coating, a method that can only be adopted in making comparatively small area devices by piece-to-piece processes, is still the most widely used method to fabricate PSCs.2 Many efforts have been made to replace spin coating with methods that are adaptable to large area production, but these attempts usually resulted in nonnegligible or sometimes even greater loss in PCE.13–15 To date, it is still a big challenge to reproduce the state-of-art PCEs of the spin-coated PSCs by the large area coating method.
Blade coating has been broadly employed to verify the feasibilities of the large area production method for PSCs. As an ideal pilot method, blade coating can be used to coat the solutions with a wide range of viscosities and the coating parameters obtained from it can be easily translated into other printing techniques.2,16–25 Recent studies revealed that the solution drying process in blade coating is much slower than that in spin coating, leading to a significant change in phase separation morphology of the photoactive layers,17,25 especially when high boiling point processing solvents are utilized. Obviously, there are two main options to modulate the solution drying process during blade coating to reproduce the high PCE of the spin-coated devices, i.e., by modifying the processing solvents before coating or by applying new treatment methods after coating.
Many efforts have been made to find suitable processing solvents for fabricating the active layers by blading coating. As is known, high boiling point additives were broadly used to control phase separation morphologies of the spin-coated active layers.26–28 However, it has been demonstrated that this method often led to the formation of large size aggregates or strong phase separation in the blade-coated active layers. In past years, quite a few interesting works demonstrated that the PSCs made by blade coating could show comparable PCEs to those made by spin coating by removal of the high boiling point solvents additives.19 However, in these works, it always required a great deal of effort to seek a suitable low or medium boiling point processing solvent that was adaptable to larger area coating methods to replace the role of the high boiling point additives. Additionally, this substitution in solvents led to a sacrifice of the PCEs of the PSCs. Therefore, it will be of great significance to explore a new treatment method for making efficient PSCs through blade coating with no need for changing the original processing solvents with high boiling point additives.
In this work, we demonstrate a simple and effective vacuum-assisted annealing (VA) method to make highly efficient PSCs through blade coating. In this method, the processing solvents for blade coating are the same as those for spin coating, i.e., the mixtures of a medium boiling point as the main solvent and a high boiling point additive. The solution of the active materials is printed onto the substrate by blade coating and then the wet film are annealed with the assistance of vacuum (∼10−1 Pa). With the help of this VA method, the unfavorable influence on the phase separation morphology caused by the slow drying process of the high boiling point additive can be completely eliminated. This method can also be used to fabricated PSCs based on a few representative photoactive blend systems, and photovoltaic performance of the PSCs made by the VA method are very similar to that of the devices fabricated by spin coating. More importantly, by employing this VA method, the optimal ingredient of processing solvent developed from spin coating can be directly used to make the large area PSCs by blade coating. For instance, by utilizing this VA method, we realized a PCE of 10.21% in a blade-coated PSC module with an active area of 12.6 cm2, which is much higher than the one processed by the traditionally used annealing process.
Results and discussion
To select a proper material system to demonstrate the superiority of the VA method, we considered the following issues in this work. First, the optimal processing solution of the active layer should be based on one low or medium boiling point solvent and one high boiling point solvent, which are representative of the widely used solvents. Second, when the active layer was made from the optimal processing solution, the change in coating method should lead to obvious differences in morphology and photovoltaic performance.
According to our previous work and experiences in practice, we selected the active layer based on a well-known polymer donor named PBDTTT-EFT, also known as PTB7-Th or PCE-10, and a well-studied acceptor named IEICO-4F. The chemical structures of the polymer donor (PBDTTT-EFT), nonfullerene acceptor (IEICO-4F) and solvents are shown in Fig. 1. The optimal processing solvent of the PBDTTT-EFT:IEICO-4F blend film for spin coating is the mixture of chlorobenzene (CB) 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) (97:4, wt/wt).29–31 The device configuration used in this work is ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate))/PBDTTT-EFT:IEICO-4F/PFN-Br/Al. Fig. 1c illustrates of the two fabrication methods of the active layers under ambient atmosphere. In detail, the blade-coated film was annealed at 100 °C for 10 minutes without any other treatment, that is, the same annealing process as for the spin-coated film. In the VA method as illustrated in Fig. 1c and Fig. S1 (ESI†), the blade-coated wet film was annealed at 100 °C for 10 minutes with the assistance of vacuum (∼10−1 Pa). Fig. 2 shows the current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices fabricated by the different methods under a 100 mW cm−2 standard AM 1.5G spectrum condition, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The device based on the spin-coated film yielded a PCE of 10.92% (see Fig. 2 and Table 1). The device based on the blade-coated film with an annealing method showed a lower PCE of 8.09%. When the VA method was used, the device exhibited a PCE of 11.10%, with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.45 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.715 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 66.19%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 2b, and the integrated Jsc are in good agreement with the Jsc obtained from the J–V measurement.

To further investigate the effect of different processing methods on the photovoltaic behavior of the devices, the relationship between photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) of the devices are plotted in Fig. 2c (Jph = JL − JD, where JL is the current density under illumination and JD is the current density in the dark. Veff = V0 − Va, where Va is the applied voltage and V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero).32 The exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) were calculated to be 85%, 81%, and 88% for the devices processed by spin coating (annealing), blade coating (annealing) and blade coating (VA), respectively. We can conclude that the device fabricated by the VA method shows more efficient exciton dissociation and higher electrode charge collection efficiency, which account for the higher Jsc and FF. In Fig. 2d, the logarithmic plots of Vocversus light intensity for the device processed by the blade coating (annealing) method shows a slope of 1.72KT/e, which is much larger than the other two devices and indicates strong bimolecular recombination. For the blade coated device processed by the VA method, a slope of 1.16KT/e is observed, which is even smaller than the device processed by spin-coating, implying the VA method in the blade coated device leads to much lower bimolecular recombination.33,34
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to investigate the phase separation morphologies of the blend films. As shown in Fig. 3, the phase separation in the film made by the blade coating (annealing) method is much stronger than that in the spin-coated film, i.e., with much larger aggregations and higher surface roughness. This phenomenon is consistent with our previous report and is detrimental to photovoltaic performance of the device.25 However, the phase separation morphology of the blend film processed by the VA method is quite similar to the spin-coated film, which reveals why these two methods lead to similar photovoltaic performance in devices.
 Fig. 3  AFM topography (a–c) and phase (d–f) images of the blend film with spin coating (annealing), blade coating (annealing), and blade coating (VA) method, respectively. 
Here, we can interpret the above results as the follows. During the spin coating process, the medium and high boiling point solvents can be evaporated with the help of the airflow due to a centrifugal effect, so the solid film is quickly formed. However, during the blade coating process, the two solvents, especially for the high boiling point additive, cannot be quickly dried, so during the annealing process, the aggregates in the film can still can be grow-up, resulting in severe phase separation. In contrast, during the VA method process, the role of the airflow for drying the film is replaced by vacuum, so the VA-blade-coated film showed similar phase separation morphology and comparable photovoltaic performance compared to the spin-coated film.
To verify the applicability of this VA method, we selected three other representative photoactive blend systems to fabricate the PSCs, including PBDB-T:N2200, PBTA-TF:IT-M, PBDB-TF:IT-4F.35–41 The experimental details are provided in Table S1 (ESI†). The blade-coating process was done in ambient atmosphere, and the thickness of the active layers was ∼100 nm, controlled by tuning the concentrations of the solutions. Fig. 4a show the photovoltaic performance of the PSC-based PBDB-T:N2200, PBTA-TF:IT-M and PBDB-TF:IT-4F, made by the traditionally used blade coating (annealing) and the blade coating (VA) method, respectively. The J–V curves of the devices are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and the detailed photovoltaic parameters were summarized in Table 2. For the blade-coated all-PSCs based PBDB-T:N2200, the device made through the VA method can improve the efficiency from 4.98% to 6.11%, which is comparable performance with its spin-coated analogue (Table S2, ESI†).42 For the blade-coated device based on PBTA-TF:IT-M, the VA method can improve the efficiency to 10.72%. Recently, the spin-coated device based on PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend film achieved over 13% efficiency (Table S2, ESI†),40 and the blade coated device fabricated by the VA method exhibit a PCE of 13.55% with a Jsc of 21.09 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.849 V, and an FF of 75.67%. Therefore, it can be concluded that the VA method is an effective method for the blade coated PSCs based on various active layer materials.

The photostability of PSCs is one of the critical issues for realizing large-scale commercialization.43 As we know, the conventional device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Al) usually exhibits a limited lifetime due to the interface instability. Therefore, the inverted device structure of the blade-coated PSCs (ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Al) was fabricated to study the stability of the device based on blend film processed by a traditional blade coating (annealing) and the blade coating (VA), respectively. The presence of high boiling point residual DIO in the active layer can affect the stability of PSCs. The photostability test was carried out over 360 hours illumination by a white LED, 100 mW cm−2. The PCE of the device fabricated by the traditional annealing method was reduced to 40% of its initial value within 360 hours. In contrast, the device fabricated by the VA method maintained more than 70% of the initial PCE, which implies the VA method can improve the blade coated device stability. The degradation of key photovoltaic parameters, such as, Jsc, Voc and FF versus time, is summarized in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The possible reasons might be the VA method can completely remove the DIO from the blade coated active layer.44,45 Recently, the large-area printed module devices has achieved much progress.46–50 Furthermore, the large-area modules were fabricated by the VA method. Fig. 4c shows the diagram of device modules with a 21.0 cm2 total area, consisting of three series-connected cells with a dimension of 7 mm × 60 mm. The dead area of each cell was determined to be 4 mm × 60 mm, resulting in an active area of 12.6 cm2 and a geometrical fill factor (GFF, defined as GFF = 1 − dead area/total area) of 60%. Fig. 4d shows the J–V curves of the large-area PBDB-TF:IT-4F-based modules made through the traditional annealing and the VA method. The device made by the VA method exhibits a PCE of 10.21% with a Voc of 2.56 V, a Jsc of 6.23 mA cm−2, and an FF of 64.02%, which is much better than that of the device made by the traditional annealing (7.45%), indicating the VA method has unique advantages in fabricating large-area blade coated module. Table S3 (ESI†) shows the photovoltaic performance of device module based on PBDB-TF:IT-4F with 21.0 cm2 total area, and a PCE of 6.13% was obtained.
Conclusions
We have developed a VA method to fabricate highly efficient blade coated PSCs. Many reported works and the results in this work have clearly demonstrated that the high boiling point solvent additives used in the spin coating method cannot be employed in blade coating. However, by adopting this new method, the optimal processing solvents with high boiling point additives developed from the spin coating process can be directly used for making the blade coated PSCs. We demonstrated that by being annealed under an easily attainable vacuum, the blade coated active layer showed almost the same phase separation morphology and photovoltaic performance as did a spin-coated device. This new method can be applied in many representative photoactive blend systems. For the PBDB-TF:IT-4F-based device made by the new method, a high PCE up to 13.55% was achieved, which is as good as the spin-coated device and the highest value for the PSCs made by blade coating. Moreover, the large-area device module with an active area of 12.6 cm2 processed by this VA method exhibited a PCE of 10.21%, demonstrating its superiority in making large area blade coated PSC modules. Overall, based on the understanding of the drying process of solvent, we solved a well-known problem in the field by a feasible method, which will also be of importance to practical production in the future.
Experimental
Materials
Polymer donor (PBDB-T, PBDTTT-EFT), non-fullerene acceptor (N2200, IEICO-4F and IT-4F) and PFN-Br were purchased from Solarmer Materials (Beijing) Inc. PBTA-TF and PBDB-TF were synthesized according to the previous paper.36,37 Small-area ITO glass (15 Ω sq−1, 1.5 × 1.5 cm2) and large-area ITO glass (15 Ω sq−1, 6.2 × 6.2 cm2) were purchased from South China Science & Technology Company Limited. The processing solvents used in the device fabrication processes were purchased from Alfa Aesar. The processing solvents used in the device fabrication were all commercially available anhydrous solvents. PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083) and electrode materials were commercially available products without further purification.
Device fabrication and characterization
The spin-coated and blade-coated PSCs with a device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ film/PFN-Br/Al were fabricated. The ITO coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 were cleaned with detergent water, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath sequentially for 20 minutes, and then dried in an oven at 150 °C for 30 minutes. After oxygen plasma cleaning for 15 min, a 10 nm layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Heraeus Materials, 4083) was spin-coated on ITO at 4000 rpm for 45 s and then annealed for 15 min at 150 °C in the air. For active layers of spin coating and blade coating, the fabrication details are listed in the Table S1 (ESI†). For instance, the concentration of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F (1:1; wt/wt) in chlorobenzene (CB) solution is 10 mg ml−1 for the polymer, and 4% CN (vol) was added into the blend solution for control morphology of the blend film. In this work, the processing solvents for blade coating are the same as those for spin coating. Then, the blend film was fabricated on the substrate by spin-coating and blade-coating method under the room temperature. For the spin-coating and the conventional blade coating method, the blend film was baked at 100 °C for 10 min. For the VA-blade coating method, blend film, the blend film was baked at 100 °C for 10 min with the assistance of vacuum (∼10−1 Pa). The thickness of blend film was ∼124 nm. The cathode buffer layer PFN-Br in methanol with concentration of 0.5 mg ml−1 was spin-coated onto the blend films at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The conventional device was deposited by thermal evaporation of Al (100 nm) through a mask with a 4 mm2 under vacuum at a pressure of 3 × 10−4 Pa. The blade-coated inverted PSCs with a device architecture of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-TF:IT-4F (CB/DIO)/MoO3/Al. The ZnO solution was spin-coated on top of a pre-cleaned, UV-ozone-treated ITO substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealing at 200 °C for 60 min to form a layer of ZnO. The fabrication of blend film is same with that blade-coated conventional PSCs.
The large-area device module fabrication
The device modules with a device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-TF:IT-4F/PFN-Br/Al were fabricated. The PEDOT:PSS film was treated in surface of the ITO. The concentration of PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1; wt/wt) in chlorobenzene (CB) solution is 6 mg ml−1 for the polymer, and 0.5% DIO (vol) was added into the blend solution for control morphology of the blend film. PFN-Br film was obtained by spin coating method. Finally, the metal Al was deposited by thermal evaporation through a mask with a 12.6 cm2 under vacuum at a pressure of 3 × 10−4 Pa. The thickness of blend layers were measured via the surface profilometer Bruker Dektak XT. The AFM images were recorded using a AFM in tapping mode. The J–V measurement was performed via the solar simulator (SS-F5-3A, Enlitech) along with AM 1.5G spectra whose intensity was calibrated by the certified standard silicon solar cell (SRC-2020, Enlitech) at 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) data were obtained by using the solar-cell spectral-response measurement system (QE-R, Enlitech).
