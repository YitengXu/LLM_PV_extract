    , Accepted 18th September 2017First published on 18th September 2017AbstractBy optimizing the lithium concentration in an electrolyte to 50 mmol L−1 and the dye-to-chenodeoxycholic acid ratio in a VG1-based dye solution, we achieved 4.7% power conversion efficiency under standard AM 1.5G conditions. In addition to this performance, we herein discuss the role played by lithium in the electrolyte and its interplay in the charge transfer processes from ms to fs dynamics. Based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, photoluminescence and pump–probe transient absorption spectroscopy, we conclude that although lithium increases the electron diffusion length, this has no satisfactory impact on electron injection and even slows dye regeneration. This study provides evidence that lithium is not only specifically adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 but prompts a molecular reorganization of the self-assembled dye monolayer, forming harmful H-aggregates.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) currently represent a promising alternative to conventional p–n junction photovoltaic technologies because they combine low cost and a low environmental footprint. Although they do not truly rival silicon, which still demonstrates great superiority in terms of intrinsic performance to convert sunlight into electricity, DSCs possess an intrinsic set of unique characteristics, such as high sensitivity to diffuse light for high yield of indoor conversion and facile integration into existing supports. This paves the way to achieving transparent and different-colored modules, which is an attractive feature for building integrated PV, bifacial light conversion or power conversion efficiency (PCE) independent of environmental temperature conditions.1 The most important aspect of this electrochemical system is a dye tailored on ruthenium(+II) polypyridyl complexes (e.g. N719, N3, N749, Z907Na, C101, and C106)2–11 or on organic chromophores.12–16 The dye controls not only the light absorption capability of the device but also the charge separation process when in contact with TiO2 and an electrolyte containing a redox mediator. Optimization of the dye/electrolyte interface recently afforded a new (uncertified) record of 14.3% power conversion efficiency by co-sensitizing the photo-anode with two push–pull organic dyes; namely, the principal dye ADEKA-1 developed on the basis of carbazole and hexyl-functionalized oligothiophene units bearing a trimethoxysilyl group as an anchoring moiety and a more conventional tri-aryl amine D–π–A dye, coded LEG4, whose excited state functions mutually with that of ADEKA-1. In conjunction with a liquid electrolyte based on a cobalt(+III/+II) tris(1,10-phenanthroline) redox mediator, this excellent device offers more than 1 V photovoltage and a photocurrent greater than 18 mA cm−2.17 Long overshadowed by ruthenium polypyridyl complexes, the continuous development of organic chromophores has revealed superior optical properties to improve incident light capture; moreover, the intrinsic richness of organic chemistry affords more advanced molecular development, leading to longer exciton dissociations while promising lower production costs and simplified up-scaling due to their easier synthetic processes. Consequently, it is unsurprising that record-breaking results were recently achieved with organic dyes. Among all developed organic dyes, namely coumarin,18 tri-arylamine based D–π–A,19 cyanines,20 croconines,21etc., the squaraine family stands out from the others due to their sharp, strong light absorption features, with molar extinction coefficients between 77000 and 389000 dm3 mol−1 cm−1,12,14,22–26 and due to their optical tunabilities, which can be extended towards lower-energy photons in the red and near-IR regions. Although these molecules are architecturally simple, the intramolecular and intermolecular charge transfer processes governing their light conversion process is not totally understood. The first squaraine dye developed for DSCs, coded SQ01, was designed on the basis of a non-symmetric framework bearing donor and acceptor units to promote long distance exciton separation and directionality for electron injection into anatase TiO2, followed by hole transfer towards iodide on the opposite part of the dye. The best power conversion efficiency with this dye reached 4.5% under AM 1.5G conditions due to optimization of the dying conditions and the electrolyte composition, which included lithium.27 Interestingly, in contrast to the preconceived belief that a non-symmetric squaraine is required to obtain a high, excited state lifetime and efficient light-to-electrical conversion efficiency, we demonstrated on the basis of both experimental and computational approaches that an adequate symmetric squaraine structure (VG1) can display highly comparable optical characteristics and photo-electrochemical performance to its asymmetric counterpart.28 This was later further confirmed by another symmetric squaraine dye, named VG10.25 The practical advantage of the symmetric structure lies in the reduction in the number of synthetic steps, no need for purification and stronger binding to TiO2 due to its bidentate anchoring mode, which is expected to be more stable against possible dye desorption events during IEC61646 ageing tests. In this study, the role of electrolyte composition in the photochemical behavior of VG1 is discussed to obtain insight into the relationship between the electrolyte composition, its interaction with the squaraine dye, and its effects on the charge transfer processes on the basis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and time-resolved emission and absorption spectroscopies down to the femtosecond time scale.
2. Experimental
2.1 Devices, procedures and chemicals
The photo-anode was composed of two layers deposited by screen-printing upon FTO-type Nippon Sheet Glass (NSG10, 10 Ω cm−2). Prior to screen-printing, the glass was carefully wiped with ethanol before sustaining thermal treatment at 450 °C under air for 30 minutes to remove organic residues. The first layer, of ca. 9 μm thickness, consisted of 20 nm-based alkaline nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 particles whose porosity before TiCl4 post-treatment was around 65% (ca. 58% after treatment). This layer was sheltered by a scattering layer of 5.5 μm thickness containing particles 400 nm in size to maximize the photon absorption capability of the photoanode (Ti-Nanoxide R/SP paste, Solaronix). The NSG10 glass as well as the photo-anode were chemically treated at 70 °C with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 minutes. Prior to sensitization, the photo-anodes were heated at 520 °C for 30 minutes to remove adsorbed molecules on the TiO2 surface, which could hamper the self-assembly of the dye. Sensitization was achieved by immersing the electrodes in the dye solution for 6 hours in darkness. The dye solution was composed of 0.1 mM VG1 dye in absolute ethanol and 10 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as a de-aggregating agent. This ratio corresponds to a previously optimized value. VG1 was synthesized according to the procedure described in our previous report.29
Pilkington TEC7 FTO glass was used as the counter-electrode. A layer of ca. 5 nm Pt nanoparticles was deposited by drop casting using a solution of 5 mM H2PtCl6 in isopropanol. Both the solvent and the organic part of the platinum complex were decomposed at 450 °C in air for 15 minutes using a hot gun, yielding Pt/PtOx nanoparticles. A Surlyn polymer gasket of 25 μm thickness was used to hermetically seal the device. The electrolyte was injected into the cell by vacuum backfilling through a 200 μm conic hole drilled by sand-blasting. The hole was capped by a glass cover slip and sealed with Surlyn. The different electrolytes were prepared based on a solvent mixture of valeronitrile and acetonitrile 15/85 (v/v). The specific compositions are listed in Table 1. Valeronitrile and acetonitrile solvents were purchased from Alfa Aesar and VWR, respectively. They were used as received without further purification. Furthermore, 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide was synthesized according to the literature, dried under vacuum and stored inside an Ar-filled glovebox.30 Iodine (>99.8%) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (96%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, whereas LiI (99%) and guanidinium thiocyanate (99%) were procured from Alfa Aesar. The (J–V) measurements were carried out on a masked cell using black tape. The light aperture was 1 mm larger than the 4 × 4 mm2 TiO2 square electrodes. The active area was precisely determined using a DEKTAK ST3 profilometer by scanning multiple horizontal and vertical lines.

2.2 Photovoltaic characterization
The power conversion efficiency was determined under AM 1.5G conditions (Pill = 100 mW cm−2) using a 3A class Newport SOL3A sun simulator equipped with a digital source meter (Keithley 2402). The incident light power was precisely determined by a standard silicon photo-diode calibrated at NREL. The (J–V) characteristics were measured under illumination by scanning the bias voltage from short-circuit to open-circuit conditions. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were carried out using a Biologic-VMP2 impedance meter with EC-Lab v10.32 software. The measurements were acquired in darkness between 105 and 0.1 Hz by superimposing a sinusoidal voltage perturbation of ΔE = 10 mV at different bias voltages from 700 to 300 mV. The resulting EIS data were adjusted by means of Zview software using the transmission line model.31
Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) was used to measure the excited state lifetimes of VG1 in ethanol. The sample was excited by a pulsed laser diode at 640 nm (EPL-640) operating at a 20 MHz repetition frequency (80 ps typical pulse width). The fluorescence was detected at 660 nm with a bandpass of 2 nm. The experiments were carried out using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 instrument equipped with excitation/emission double monochromators and a MCP-PMT detector mounted after the first emission monochromator. The typical IRF value in this configuration is in the range from 80 to 90 ps. Solid samples were positioned in the front face by contrast to 45° for liquids. The steady state spectra were measured using a continuous xenon arc lamp (450 W) for excitation. The emission was detected by a high-gain PMT photomultiplier mounted after the second emission monochromator to reduce stray light rejection to less than 10−10. The quantum yield of fluorescence was determined at an excitation wavelength of 585 nm using a Benflec integration sphere according to the indirect procedure.32 The ultrafast transient absorption experiments were carried out using an apparatus described elsewhere.33 Specifically, here, pump pulses at 640 nm (100 fs, 1 kHz, FWHM 400 μm) were obtained using an OPA (Palitra, Excell Continuum) pumped by a 1 kHz Ti:sapphire laser system, which delivered 100 fs (0.8 mJ) pulses at 800 nm. The pump–probe polarization configuration was set at the magic angle (54.7°). The energies of the pump pulses at the sample were adjusted with a neutral density filter to verify that non-linear and annihilation processes did not occur during the experiments. To accomplish this, three different pump energies were checked every time: 0.05 μJ (30 mW cm−2), 0.2 μJ (125 mW cm−2) and 1 μJ (625 mW cm−2). Kinetic were changing for the last one and thus only the first one were analysed. This power is similar to that of solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The cell was mounted perpendicular to the pump and probe beam; in addition, to avoid degradation of the dye within the cell, the number of accumulations per time delay was varied for the different pump powers (10000, 3600, and 1800, respectively) and the sample was checked after each experiment. The laser flash photolysis apparatus, which was used to perform the nanosecond millisecond transient absorption experiments, has been previously described elsewhere.34 The only modification is that here, the cell was tilted with an angle of about 45° with respect to the 640 nm pump pulses (1 mJ, 4 ns, 0.5 Hz) and the white probe beam. The recorded traces were averaged for 32 pulses, and it was verified that there was no degradation of the cell after each experiment.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Effects of CDCA on the photodynamic properties of symmetrical VG1 dye
Organic dyes commonly tend to form strong aggregates in solution. Molecular aggregates, more particularly H-type for squaraine dyes, are detrimental to device performance due to the singlet–singlet annihilation process, which decreases the rate of electron injection.35,36 This quenching path is an important limitation of squaraine dyes. Energy losses in VG1 also arise from the important overlap between the absorption and emission spectra; this contributes to undesirable Förster-type resonance energy transfer, as indicated by Douhal et al.35 The addition of de-aggregating agents to the dye solution is thus particularly important to improve device performance. Squaraine dyes, including VG1, are not exempt from this significant issue. Thus, the introduction of a de-aggregating agent into the dye solution is required; the most common of these is chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA).27,37 Its utilization can sometimes reduce dye loading depending on the ratio because its carboxylic acid functional groups enter into competition with the dye anchorage. Although this creates a loss of light capture, it is in most cases compensated by a more efficient charge separation process, leading to improvements in IPCE and power conversion efficiency.37,38
VG1 molecules in the dye solution are characterized by a sharp excitation band centered at 646 nm in ethanol solution, accompanied by strong fluorescence at a maximum of 657 nm, corresponding to a narrow Stokes shift of only 260 cm−1 (Fig. 1). The quantum yield of fluorescence in ethanol is 35%. The decay of photo-luminescence (PL) is adjusted with a bi-exponential function with two time constants of τ1 = 0.91 ns and τ2 = 1.53 ns. The longer component is predominant, i.e. 77.2% of the total decay (Table 2). These two lifetimes correspond to trans- and cis-photoisomerism in solution.39 The effects of CDCA concentration up to 100 mmol L−1 on the excited state lifetime of the dye are reported in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Two components are systematically required to properly account for the experimental decay. The introduction of CDCA increases the excited state lifetimes to τ1 = 1.88 ns (40.5%) and τ2 = 2.30 ns (59.5%) (Table 2). As can be seen, the two contributions become closer in amplitude. This result suggests that CDCA not only disrupts molecular aggregates, as is commonly reported in literature, but also influences the photo-isomerism reaction between the cis and trans configurations. The quantum yield of luminescence attains a maximum of 48% at 10 mmol L−1 before declining to 42% at higher concentrations (i.e. 100 mmol L−1). The quenching of luminescence in the absence of CDCA is a consequence of intermolecular interactions between VG1 H-aggregated molecules in solution, promoted by the low Stokes shift. For comparison, this radiative de-excitation of the dye excited state is significantly faster than in current benchmark ruthenium polypyridyl complexes, which lie between 10 and 60 ns.11,40 The optimal luminescence properties of the dye also correspond to the best device performance (10 mmol L−1 of CDCA) even though at this concentration level, some CDCA attaches to TiO2 along with the dye, leading to a reduction in dye loading.41,42

2D and 3D excitation/emission mappings of VG1 in ethanol solution without and with 10 mM CDCA are reported in Fig. S2 (ESI†). This figure shows that VG1 exhibits two distinct bands: the most intense band is at 644 nm (S0 → S1 transition), and the second, lower-intensity band lies deeper in the UV region at 294 nm (S0 → Sn transition). These two bands yield very similar emission wavelengths at ca. 660 nm. The addition of CDCA only gives rise to a small narrowing of the main S0 → S1 excitation band together with a slight decrease in intensity and a shift of the second minor contribution to 302 nm. This suggests that the H-aggregates are very strong in ethanol solution and can only be partially hindered by CDCA, in agreement with Douhal et al.35,39 Note that CDCA has an optical trace in the UV region visible at ca. 290 nm, with a broad multi-component emission between 300 to 400 nm. Its fingerprint is also present on the sensitized electrodes, confirming its presence on the self-assembled dye monolayer.
3.2 Effects of lithium concentration on device performance
Small alkali cations such as H+, Li+ or Na+ are known to specifically absorb upon the surface of TiO2. The main consequence of this interfacial modification is a decrease in the flat band potential and the energy of the trap states according to the Nernst equation (decrease of 59 mV per decade of alkali cation concentration).43–48 Adding LiI or NaI to the electrolyte composition is a typical method to precisely control the electron acceptor energy in TiO2, thus optimizing the rate of electron injection and the device performance. This often translates into a gain of photo-current and a partial loss of photo-voltage. The incorporation of lithium in the electrolyte is often mandatory, particularly for dyes with low-lying LUMO levels or when the sensitizer has relatively short excited state lifetimes which can enter into kinetic competition with the charge injection. These two important features are found in VG1 dye, whose LUMO levels are located at −0.80 V vs. NHE, corresponding to a driving force for electron injection into TiO2 of ca. 250 to 300 mV.49,50 For comparison, the LUMO levels in the benchmark N719 dye, which mainly undergoes injection from the triplet states, are located in the range of −1.10 V vs. NHE.51–53 For this dye, the utilization of lithium in the electrolyte is not required to obtain optimal power conversion efficiency.
The effects of the lithium concentration in the electrolyte on the photovoltaic characteristics of VG1 dye are reported in Fig. 2, and the cell characteristics are reported in Table 3. Increasing the concentration of Li+ leads to a continuous reduction of the open circuit photo-voltage by about 54 mV per decade of concentration. This appears at first sight to be in good agreement with the Nernst equation for a specific adsorption mechanism.

As aforementioned, although the utilization of lithium in the electrolyte is detrimental to the cell photovoltage, its loss is compensated by a gain in photocurrent when a low concentration of 50 mmol L−1 of lithium is included in the electrolyte. Indeed, at this concentration, the photovoltage loss is limited to only 1.8% (from 654 mV to 642 mV), whereas the gain in short-circuit current density is +9.6% (from 9.4 mA cm−2 to 10.3 mA cm−2). This leads to a slight improvement of the power conversion efficiency from 4.5% to 4.7%. A more surprising and interesting feature is the decrease in photo-current that is experienced at greater concentrations of LiI, namely 9.1 mA cm−2 at 100 mmol L−1 and as low as 6.7 mA cm−2 at 500 mmol L−1; this cannot be simply explained by the specific adsorption mechanism. This noticeable photo-current loss is accompanied by a decrease in photo-voltage, thus strongly penalizing the power conversion efficiency, which declines to 3.8% and even to 2.8% at a concentration of 500 mmol L−1. To the best of our knowledge, this loss of photo-current upon addition of lithium to the electrolyte has never been reported in the literature. For example, Jennings et al. reported a Z907 dye where increasing the lithium concentration in the electrolyte led to a systematic increase in photo-current, even at a lithium concentration of 1 mol L−1.47 We estimate that the decrease in photo-current at higher concentrations of lithium is specific to squaraine structures.
3.3 Effects of lithium concentration on electron transport vs. non-geminate recombination
The introduction of lithium iodide in the electrolyte has an influence on slow components, namely charge transport and electron interception by tri-iodide (non-geminate recombination). The possible redistribution and energy shift of the localized traps subsequent to the specific adsorption of lithium cation is one source of this effect. These two antagonist processes were monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using the transmission line model. This model is particularly suitable to describe the behavior of a porous electrode in electrochemical systems, and is thus adapted to mesoscopic dye-sensitized solar cells.31,54Fig. 3 shows the influence of Li+ concentration in the electrolyte on the trap state distribution in TiO2. As previously observed in the literature with other dyes, increasing the concentration of lithium cation in the electrolyte causes a downshift in the energy of the trap states without modifying their distribution.46 In the case of VG1, the traps are downshifted by 108 mV per decade of lithium concentration, almost twice the value expected by the Nernst equation.45 This result suggests that the specific absorption of Li+ onto TiO2 is not the sole mechanism inducing the downshift of the DOS. As will be discussed further in the last section of this manuscript, we argue that lithium cation not only proceeds to the surface of the anatase TiO2 but also coordinates with the dye, modifying the self-assembled dye monolayer.
 Fig. 3  Distribution and energetics of the chemical capacitance (Cμ) for VG1-sensitized TiO2 cells containing different concentrations of LiI. 
This super-Nernstian value is about twice that of the photovoltage loss. This indicates that the energetic loss in the device under illumination stems from the downshift in energy of the surface trap states; this is compensated to some extent by an acceleration of the injection rate and/or a reduction of the charge recombination dynamics with tri-iodide, as similarly noticed on ruthenium polypyridyl complexes.46
The evolutions of the two time constants, namely transport time (τt) and electron lifetime (τe), are reported as a function of the bias voltage in Fig. 4a and b and as function of the built-up charge in Fig. 4c and d. The electron transport process in the lithium-free electrolyte has a time constant closer to that of the non-geminate recombination process; this leads to a higher incertitude of the value obtained from the transmission line fitting, thus explaining the higher scattering of the points in contrast to an electrolyte containing lithium regardless of its concentration. The electron transport time decreases by more than one order of magnitude with increasing Li+ concentration at a fixed energy. This correlation is in agreement with an ambipolar diffusion mechanism in which the electrons and lithium in the electrolyte are paired with a weak electric field to form a quasi-particle.55 The presence of highly mobile lithium cations in the vicinity of the TiO2 surface thus accelerates the transport or reduces the random walk tortuosity of the electrons at the same energy. However, if we consider the same density of charges, the lithium in the electrolyte reduces the electron transport time by about fivefold with the concentration ranging from 0 to 500 mmol L−1. Note that the slopes of the semi-logarithmic curves are comparable for the different contents of lithium. This suggests that the transport path remains similar (Fig. 4a and c), thus ruling out a possible change of tortuosity towards collection. A less blatant effect is experienced for the recombination (Fig. 4b). One can deduce that a low concentration of lithium (i.e. ≤50 mmol L−1) increases the electron lifetime two to three fold before becoming relatively comparable or even slightly lower at higher concentrations. In contrast, comparing similar built-in charges, the greater the lithium content in the electrolyte, the longer the electron lifetime (Fig. 4d). This feature is not surprising because (i) the electrons are more strongly trapped within the bandgap, and (ii) the interfacial shielding between the electrons and tri-iodide hampers the electron transfer.
 Fig. 4  Evolution of the transport times and electron lifetimes as a function of the applied bias voltage (a and b) and as a function of the density of states (DOS) (c and d) of VG1-sensitized TiO2 cells containing different concentrations of LiI. 
Based on these results, we deduced the effective diffusion length of the electrons using the most commonly used eqn (1): (1)It should be borne in mind that the validity of using both small perturbation methods such as impedance spectroscopy and this latter equation, which is not derived from first principles, to provide an accurate number is still debated in the literature, particularly when recombination remains ongoing at short-circuit conditions.56,57 Thus, particular care should be exercised regarding the reported values (not the evolution). The normalized evolution of the electron diffusion length to the film thickness shows that all the values are greater than one as long as lithium is incorporated into the electrolyte (Fig. 5). This is in contrast with the lithium-free electrolyte, for which this value can fall below 1 along a large range of carrier densities. Again, although the method herein used may be quantitatively limited, it appears nonetheless clear that the introduction of lithium cation in the electrolyte is beneficial to improve the charge collection efficiency. It is also interesting to note that the charge collection efficiency becomes saturated or even begins to decrease when the electrolyte contains lithium and that the TiO2 traps are filled with a high density of carriers. Although this observation is highly reproducible across experiments, its origin remains unclear. One plausible hypothesis is that dye aggregation induced by the incorporation of lithium in the electrolyte (which will be discussed thoroughly in the following section) becomes a controlling factor that impedes the charge collection above a threshold of charges.

3.4 Effects of lithium concentration on charge injection and dye regeneration
Microsecond pump–probe transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was carried out to monitor the evolution of the dye regeneration rate with an electrolyte containing a redox mediator and the geminate recombination with an electrolyte free of redox mediator. To maintain a constant concentration of iodide in the electrolyte during the experiments, lithium perchlorate LiClO4 was used instead of LiI. To achieve this, we pumped the excited state at 640 nm with a nanosecond laser and probed the evolution of absorbance of the VG1 dye cations at 580 nm. A representative example of the transient absorption decay in the presence and absence of a redox mediator is reported in Fig. 6 for the case of an electrolyte containing 50 mmol L−1 lithium. The time evolution of absorbance was fitted using a stretched exponential to account for the heterogeneity. A slight influence of lithium in the electrolyte was found. We measured a characteristic time constant for regeneration of about 1.10 μs for a lithium-free electrolyte (Table 4) with β of 0.32; this reflects the heterogeneity of the sample and the exponential distribution of trap states in TiO2.36 This characteristic time compares favorably with those of ruthenium dyes, whose half time values were reported to be between 2.0 and 80 μs.8,58–60 With 50 mmol L−1 lithium, a small reduction in regeneration speed was found from 1.10 μs to 1.24 μs with similar heterogeneity. This speed can even reach 2 μs and longer for higher concentrations with better homogeneity. This result is in contrast to what was reported by Grätzel et al. for the Ru bipyridyl N719 complex; they found that lithium accelerated the dye regeneration.61 In the absence of a redox couple, which enables monitoring the half-time geminate recombination with the dye cation, the values were around ca. 320 μs regardless of the concentration of lithium (Table 4). For all concentrations, the regeneration yield in VG1 remains close to quantitative; the greatest value of 99.6% is obtained when the electrolyte is lithium-free. The β value increased from 0.32 to 0.41 with increasing lithium concentration. This variation further suggests that lithium affects the monolayer geometry of the dye, which becomes more homogeneous in terms of charge transfer rate dispersion.

Generally, the role of lithium is to promote fast to ultra-fast (<ps) charge injection from the excited state of the dye.53 We used both picosecond time-correlated single photon counting (TCPSC) and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to determine the charge injection rate in VG1 as a function of lithium concentration. The PL decay was monitored by exciting the VG1 dye at 640 nm while probing the emission at 690 nm. All the PL decays showed a major fast component at the limit of the instrumental response (IRF ≈ 90 ps) and a minor second component contributing to less than 10% of the total decay (Fig. S3, ESI†). The lifetime values after reconvolution from the IRF are gathered in Table 5. First, without lithium, the determination of the charge injection is in the range of the limits of our configuration, ca. 25 ps. This value is faster than what is typically encountered with ruthenium complexes, which inject mainly from the triplet excited state in the range of 100 to 3000 ps (note: single state injection is sub-ps but is in competition with inter-system crossing in the range of 100 fs).53,61 Surprisingly, the introduction of lithium in the electrolyte did not enhance the injection rate. In fact, it appears that the opposite occurs because the values after reconvolution increased to ca. 40 ps in the presence of lithium; for the second minor contribution, the increase was more noticeable (to 500 ps). In complement to ps-TCSPC, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was carried out to more accurately determine the injection half-time and the evolution with lithium concentration.

The TAS spectra of all four samples were recorded at different pump–probe delays from 0 to 800 ps. After pumping the excited state within the few first hundreds of femtoseconds, Fig. 7 shows the evolution of the transient spectra from 0.5 ps to 800 ps. For the sample without lithium in the electrolyte at 0.5 ps, the spectrum is characterized by one broad positive band between 450 nm and 600 nm with a maximum at 508 nm and two shoulders at 555 nm and 590 nm, respectively, and two negative bands between 600 nm and 735 nm with two maxima at 620 nm and 685 nm, assigned to the ground state depopulation and stimulated emission, respectively. The different maxima observed for the positive band are assigned to the absorbance of the excited state of the monomer, H-aggregates and the radical cation of the dye, in agreement with the literature.35,36,62 The band of the monomer was excited and the stimulated emission decayed in a few picoseconds without almost any evolution of the ground state depopulation (green arrow) and a slight increase of the band at 590 nm (Fig. S4, ESI†). This fast contribution is thus assigned mainly to the formation of dye radical cation from the singlet monomer excited state.35,62 After the monomer decay (time delay at 35 ps), the positive band assigned to the excited state of the H-aggregates showed a maximum at 555 nm.35,62 This band decayed in a few hundreds of picoseconds, concomitantly with the stimulated emission and ground state depopulation bands. Injection from the H-aggregate is slower; its main decaying pathway is its relaxation to the ground state (radiative and non-radiative pathways). At 800 ps, a weak positive band remained at 590 nm, which corresponds to the transient fingerprint of the dye radical cation. Increasing the lithium concentration in the electrolyte initially appeared to provide a similar transient evolution. However, upon more careful inspection of the spectral shape, one can notice an increase in the shoulder at 555 nm relative to that of the monomer band. This is in agreement with the increase of H-aggregate species for a higher amount of lithium.

As the monomer and H-aggregate excited state bands strongly overlap, to precisely estimate the injection rate, the decays at 508 nm and 555 nm were analysed by a global analysis method using a stretched mono-exponential function (Fig. S4, ESI†). The time constant values for injection are reported together with the β values in Table 6. This method is more precise than TCSPC and provided similar conclusions: the incorporation of lithium in the electrolyte does not enhance the injection rate in the case of the monomer VG1: 5.5 ps (±0.6 ps) for the electrolyte free of lithium and 4.2 ps (±0.5 ps) for the same electrolyte containing 500 mmol L−1 lithium. The fast decay of the singlet S1 state of VG1 monomer leads to injection rate constants of 1.8 × 1011 s−1 and 2.4 × 1011 s−1. The electron injection from the H-aggregates probed at 555 nm is much slower, as one could expect: 44 ps (±30 ps) for the electrolyte free of lithium and 73 ps (±5.1 ps) for the same electrolyte containing 500 mmol L−1 lithium. Although the numbers are slightly different, these results confirm those reported by Douhal et al. for different squaraines.62

3.5 Discussion of the effects of lithium on the squaraine dye monolayer
The role of lithium with the symmetric VG1 squaraine dye appears to be different than that with ruthenium polypyridyl complexes. Indeed, in this study, we revealed the following.
– The inclusion of lithium in the electrolyte from 0 to 50 mmol L−1 allows only a modest increase of the power conversion efficiency from 4.5% to 4.7% before it declines substantially as a result of the drop in photo-current.
– A super-Nernstian shift of the trap states is observed with lithium concentration (108 mV per decade of lithium concentration). This suggests that specific adsorption of lithium upon TiO2 is not the only mechanism.
– The incorporation of lithium in the electrolyte improves the charge collection efficiency. It has no impact on the dynamic of singlet state charge injection from the monomer and tends to slow injection from the H-aggregates and dye regeneration by two-fold.
– A shoulder at 550 to 555 nm in the TAS spectra, attributed to H-aggregates, is promoted when the electrolyte contains lithium.
Based on our experimental evidence, it appears that lithium in the electrolyte not only plays the expected role of potentially determining cations to promote injection, but also induces a reorganisation of the dye monolayer at the surface of TiO2, promoting the formation of H-aggregates. It is now well-established that the dye monolayer geometry on the surface of TiO2 can noticeably affect the non-geminate recombination and injection yield, therefore affecting the power conversion efficiency.63 The TAS experiments, which show the prevalence of this shoulder at ca. 550 nm, support this hypothesis. In addition to TAS, careful analysis of the evolution of the UV-visible absorption spectra of the different devices containing various concentrations of lithium shows an increase in absorption shoulder at 620 nm together with the onset of a broad background absorption (Fig. 8). This again stems from the formation of H-aggregates upon the TiO2 surface. We argue that the promotion of H-aggregates driven by lithium is the result of electrostatic interactions between the positively charged lithium, which is one of the most polarizing cations in the periodical classification, and the negatively charged oxygen of the squaric core. This complexing property of lithium is well known in conducting polymers based on POE,64 triethylene oxide methyl ether (TEOME)65 and crown ethers such as 12-crown-4.66 Lithium cation coordinates with different squaric cores of VG1 in its neighbourhood to form less efficient aggregate-like particles upon the surface of TiO2. This hypothesis was further confirmed by LC/MS analysis (Fig. S5, ESI†). For this analysis, a solution of VG1 was prepared in ethanol containing different ratios of LiI while rigorously preserving the same ratio between the dye loaded electrode (0.9 × 10−8 moles in the complete device) and the quantity of lithium in the electrolyte. We calculated that an electrolyte containing 500 mmol L−1 LiI contains 33 Li+ cations in the electrolyte per molecule of VG1 anchored upon TiO2. LC/MS analysis stressed that lithium coordinates to VG1, yielding C44H56N2O6Li (relative abundance 72%, calculated M+: 715.4), C44H55N2O6Li2 (relative abundance 30%, calculated M+: 721.4) and C44H54N2O6Li3 (relative abundance <10%, calculated mass: 727.4).

4. Conclusions
Optimization of the photovoltaic performance of TiO2 sensitized with VG1 symmetric squaraine led to a power conversion efficiency of 4.7% by means of a dye solution of 0.1 mmol L−1 VG1 in ethanol containing 10 mmol L−1 CDCA and an electrolyte composed of 50 mmol L−1 lithium cation. The utilization of CDCA in the dye solution helps prevent excessive dye aggregation without totally impeding it. The introduction of a small quantity of lithium in the electrolyte, which only slightly improves the cell efficiency, affords notably decreased electron recombination. As a result, the incorporation of lithium is an excellent method to bring the electron diffusion length normalized by the electrode thickness to a value greater than one with this family of dyes. However, an intrinsic quality of the squaraine dyes is that an excessive concentration of lithium in the electrolyte drastically harms the device performance, even though the charge collection efficiency is maximized. Based on TCPSC, ns-TAS and fs-TAS, lithium cation slows the rate of dye regeneration without accelerating the charge injection as one would expect. We conclude based on various experimental evidence that lithium plays the role of a complexing agent and that the negatively charged oxygen of the squaric core likely induces the formation of aggregate-like particles within the self-assembled monolayer upon the TiO2 surface.
