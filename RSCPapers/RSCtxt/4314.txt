    , Accepted 19th March 2017First published on 20th March 2017AbstractTo enhance the electrochemical performance and syngas production in low-temperature co-electrolysis (LT-Co-EC), incorporation of Pd into the nickel–yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni–YSZ) fuel electrode functional layer (FEFL) of a thin film-based solid oxide cell (TF-SOC) by multi-layer thin film deposition was investigated. The optimal configuration to insert a Pd layer without disturbing the surface and cross-sectional microstructure of the FEFL was fabricated by alternating multi-layer deposition of Pd by sputtering and nickel oxide–yttria-stabilized zirconia (NiO–YSZ) by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). TF-SOCs with Pd (Pd-cell) and without Pd (Ref-cell) were fabricated and compared based on the electrochemical reaction and syngas production in LT-Co-EC. The results showed that the catalytic activity by forming the Pd–Ni alloy on the electrochemical performance and thermochemical reaction are improved by Pd incorporation at low temperatures (≤600 °C). Detailed microstructural analyses showed that Pd distributes from the electrode/electrolyte interface to a depth of several tens of microns in the anode support and forms a nano-structured Ni–Pd alloy, which contributes to improving the electrochemical reaction and thermochemical reactions such as water–gas-shift (WGS). It was also found that the performance stability was superior in the Pd-cell because pore array generation at the electrolyte/electrode interface was significantly suppressed in comparison with that of the Ref-cell.
1. Introduction
Rapid growth of the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide as a result of the massive use of non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels has led to widespread environmental issues like resource depletion and climate change. Thus, it is necessary to mitigate the emission and/or to consume the existing carbon dioxide efficiently. Steam/CO2 co-electrolysis (Co-EC) in a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC), which uses surplus electricity from renewable energy sources like wind and solar, is an effective method for the conversion of CO2 to syngas, a mixture of H2 and CO, and for leveling the fluctuation in renewable energy output.1,2 In Co-EC, the produced syngas can be used as an inlet reactant for hydrocarbon fuel production through the Fischer–Tropsch process;3 in addition, pure oxygen can be formed from this process as a valuable by-product.
In the Co-EC of solid oxide cells (SOCs), the electrochemical reactions that occur at the fuel electrode are4 H2O (g) + 2e− → H2 (g) + O2−(1-1) CO2 (g) + 2e− → CO (g) + O2−(1-2)
At the air electrode: O2− → 1/2O2 + 2e−(2)
The overall reaction becomes H2O + CO2 → H2 + CO + O2(3)
Additionally, thermochemical reactions occur at the fuel electrode, such as water–gas-shift (WGS) or reverse-water–gas-shift reactions (RWGSs) (forward and reverse reactions of eqn (4), respectively) and steam–methane reforming or CO methanation reactions (forward and reverse reactions of eqn (5), respectively), along with electrochemical reactions.4 CO (g) + H2O (g) ⇄ CO2 (g) + H2 (g)(4) CH4 (g) + H2O (g) ⇄ 3H2 (g) + CO (g)(5)
A nickel and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) composite is commonly employed in a conventional fuel electrode of an SOC, and nickel catalyzes these reactions. In the Co-EC mode, it can be assumed that the primary pathway for CO2 reduction (by hydrogen) is the RWGS reaction (reverse of eqn (4)).5 Under special conditions like low temperatures and high pressures, the reaction between the generated CO and H2 to form methane (reverse eqn (5)) can be favorable.4
Most researchers in the Co-EC field focus on high-temperature (≥750 °C) operation since it reduces the electrical energy demand of the electrolysis process. This is because steam/CO2 dissociation becomes increasingly endothermic in the fuel electrode with temperature.6–8 Furthermore, higher operating temperatures enhance electrode reaction kinetics and reduce the ohmic resistance, which results in performance improvement.9,10 In 2010, researchers at the Risø National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy and Columbia University studied high-temperature Co-EC using an SOC (denoted as HT-Co-EC) to generate syngas.11 In this study, the initial performance and degradation of HT-Co-EC were investigated and the modified electrode for enhancing electrolysis performance and for improving the long-term stability was suggested. Studies at the Idaho National Laboratory optimized materials for HT-Co-EC to generate syngas with a high efficiency.12 The study demonstrated the potential of HT-Co-EC for syngas production12 and widened the application prospects of SOECs in energy storage by power-to-fuel transformation. Until now, by using state-of-the-art SOCs, many studies have been performed on the performance,11–15 durability,11 materials,16 and systems1,7 of HT-Co-EC.
In spite of the above-mentioned merits and interests, however, at high operating temperatures the thermal and/or chemical instability of the material of the cell and stack components increases; in events that induce temperature difference like start-up, shut-down, and steep variations in the current density loading, mechanical damage due to the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients of the different components is easily generated.17 If the Co-EC temperature can be lowered without deteriorating the performance, then the disadvantages of HT-Co-EC can be overcome, i.e., the degradation due to high temperature can be suppressed, resulting in prolonged lifetime and stability. More specifically, in low-temperature Co-ECs (LT-Co-EC), lower-cost materials can be used for balance-of-plant and interconnects; additionally, the heat demand and thermal insulation requirements are reduced, which leads to cost reduction.18 At a lower operating temperature the composition of the H2O–CO2 Co-EC product can be shifted to one with substantial CH4, which is another potential usefulness of LT-Co-EC.18 Also, recent system calculations indicate that a LT-Co-EC operating temperature of less than 650 °C may gain a round-trip storage efficiency higher than 70%.4,19,20 Moreover, a reduced electrolysis voltage may be achieved in LT-Co-EC, which can improve long-term electrolysis durability by suppressing the degradation of the electrode induced by high voltage of operation and current densities.7,21–23 Additionally, on the basis of thermal balance, the heat demand decreases significantly with decreasing temperature. As a result, the total energy demand of the electrolysis reaction at low temperatures can be lower than that at high temperatures.24 Moreover, it is possible that the temperature of the syngas produced by LT-Co-EC can be more appropriate as a feedstock for the Fischer–Tropsch process (∼150–300 °C) in terms of the temperature difference.
However, only a few studies were reported on the performance of LT-Co-EC (≤750 °C)25 due to substantial decreases in the electrochemical performance, which hampers reasonable assessment of LT-Co-EC. In order to overcome this problem by improving the catalytic activity at the electrodes, noble metal-based catalysts such as Pd, Ru, and Rh were incorporated. For example, Ru/ZrO2–La2O3,26 Ru/Ni/Al2O3,27 Pd/La2O3–Al2O3,28 Pd/NiO–MgO,29 and Pd–Rh/metal foam30 have been studied to improve the electrochemical performance of the electrode at low temperatures. Nevertheless, despite the improved catalytic activity of the electrode, low-temperature operation retards the electrolysis cell performance significantly relative to that in high-temperature operation. It can be said that the lack of an appropriate cell technology at low temperatures is the main hurdle for assessing LT-Co-EC.
During the past decade, we have successfully developed low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs) based on thin-film electrolytes and nano-structured electrodes.31–35 With this technology, a comparable cell performance at ∼200 °C lower than that of a high-temperature operating SOFC could be obtained. Based on this platform, we expect that the potential of LT-Co-EC can be revealed. Therefore, in this study, the LT-Co-EC performances were analyzed at 500–600 °C using a thin-film-based SOC (TF-SOC). Furthermore, to improve the catalytic activity of the fuel electrode, we designed a multi-layer configuration incorporating Pd by thin-film deposition. By depositing alternating layers of the NiO–YSZ fuel electrode and the Pd catalyst, an optimal Pd incorporation configuration for the structural stability of the fuel electrode functional layer (FEFL) and thin film electrolyte can be obtained. Since thin-film deposition was used, the exact amount of the Pd catalyst could be controlled by adjusting the thickness of the film, and inserting the catalyst at the FEFL right beneath the electrolyte was possible. We tried to reveal the reaction mechanism of LT-Co-EC using the TF-SOC technology, and the impact of Pd catalyst addition was investigated by comparing TF-SOCs with and without Pd catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Optimization of the FEFL configuration
A NiO–YSZ fuel electrode support was fabricated by tape casting. Seven layers of 150 μm-thick NiO–YSZ tape with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as the pore-forming agent and one layer of 30 μm-thick NiO–YSZ tape without PMMA were laminated at 75 °C under a uniaxial pressure of 15 MPa. The laminated substrate was sintered at 1300 °C for 4 h to obtain a completely rigid substrate. A 2 cm × 2 cm support was prepared to deposit the active components of the SOC. The preparation of the fuel electrode support was identical to that described in a previous study.32
In order to define the appropriate FEFL configuration for adding the Pd catalyst (e.g., the position and thickness of the Pd layer), four configurations were implemented, as shown in Table 1. To realize these structures, NiO–YSZ thin films (the main FEFL) were deposited on the surface of the fuel electrode support by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) at a substrate temperature (Ts) of 700 °C and an ambient oxygen pressure (Pamb) of 6.67 Pa. A Pd thin film was deposited onto the PLD NiO–YSZ layer by using a radio frequency (RF) sputtering system in Ar (working pressure = 0.667 Pa) at room temperature, using a pure Pd (99.99% purity) target of 2 inch diameter and 1/8 inch thickness. By stacking the multiple layers, the configurations mentioned in Table 1 were fabricated. The support with the deposited multi-layer FEFL was post-annealed at 1200 °C in air for 1 h to prevent uncontrollable Ni agglomeration.36–38

To define the appropriate FEFL configuration, the surface and cross-sectional microstructures were observed after post-annealing and after reduction using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The reduction process of the FEFL over the support was carried out at 600 °C for 10 h in a 4% H2–Ar atmosphere.
2.2. TF-SOC fabrication and LT-Co-EC test
Two different TF-SOCs were prepared: one was a reference cell without Pd insertion in the FEFL, and the other was a cell with Pd added in the FEFL, which was optimized as described in Section 2.1. The configurations of the fabricated cells are illustrated in Fig. 1. The cell without Pd is denoted as the Ref-cell and that with Pd in the FEFL is denoted as the Pd-cell hereafter.
 Fig. 1  Schematics of the fabricated TF-SOCs: (a) Ref-cell and (b) Pd-cell. (c) Enlarged image of the optimal FEFL configuration of the Pd-cell. 
To prepare the Ref-cell, the PLD method was used to deposit a 2 μm-thick NiO–YSZ FEFL onto the tape-cast fuel electrode support at a Ts of 700 °C and a Pamb of 6.67 Pa. The prepared electrode was post-annealed at 1200 °C for 1 h in air. Later, a 1 μm-thick YSZ electrolyte and 200 nm-thick gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) buffer layer were deposited using PLD at a Ts of 700 °C and a Pamb of 6.67 Pa. A 3 μm-thick LSC layer with a 1 cm × 1 cm area was deposited on the GDC by PLD at room temperature and a Pamb of 13.3 Pa, followed by post-annealing at 650 °C for 1 h in air to crystallize the air electrode. This is a routine process and configuration for fabricating a TF-SOC for SOFC experiments.32,34–36,38,39
The Pd-cell was also prepared in a fuel electrode-supported configuration similar to the Ref-cell, except for the FEFL. The fabrication process and configuration of the FEFL in this cell follow the optimized conditions described in Section 2.1. The electrolyte, buffer, and air electrode were directly deposited on the FEFL surface under identical deposition conditions to those of the Ref-cell.
Electrochemical characterization was performed using a Co-EC testing system, as shown in Fig. S1.† The detailed testing configuration was depicted in a previous study.40 On the top and bottom of the cell, metallic Inconel end-plates with gas channels were utilized. The gas channels were designed to obtain a counter-flow of air and fuel gases. Ni foam and Au mesh were used as current collectors at the fuel and air electrodes, respectively, to minimize the cell performance loss caused by contact resistance. During operation, air was used as the oxidant and steam and carbon dioxide were supplied as a fuel. To avoid nickel oxidation, 10% hydrogen was introduced with the steam/CO2 mixture. An inert gas (argon) was used as the diluent gas. To control the amount of the inlet gas, mass flow controllers (MFCs; Bronkhorst, USA) were connected to the system. Water after passing through a reverse osmosis system (RO-Pure Plus, Premier, USA) went through a humidifier to supply deionized water. The LT-Co-EC test was performed at 500, 550, and 600 °C at the reactant concentration of 30% H2O–30% CO2–10% H2–30% Ar. Before the LT-Co-EC testing, initial fuel cell testing was performed at 600 °C for 1 h after 15 h of reduction at the same temperature. The whole LT-Co-EC testing lasted for approximately 72 h (three days). For comparing the cell performance change during the LT-Co-EC, the final fuel cell testing was carried out at 600 °C for 1 h. A Solartron 1260 Impedance/Gain-Phase Analyzer was used to obtain the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and current–voltage (I–V) curves.
To measure the composition of the product gas continuously, online mass spectrometry (MS, Hiden HPR-20 QIC, USA) and gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890B, USA) connected to the tail-end of the cell-testing system were used. Mass spectrometry (MS) was used to measure the product gas composition when the current density was increasingly applied during operation since it is not necessary to wait for the saturated state for MS analyses. On the other hand, GC requires a stable gas composition; therefore, a discharge time of 30 min was required. Therefore, GC was used for measuring the gas composition under open cell voltage (OCV) conditions in order to minimize degradation of the cell during the test. Gas samples were tested by GC several times to secure the measurement reliability.
The microstructures of each tested cell were acquired using SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). For a detailed observation at the FEFL/electrolyte interface, focused ion beam (FIB) milling followed by SEM observation was used.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Considerations for the Pd catalyst layer insertion at the FEFL
For HT-Co-EC, infiltration can be one of the best methods to insert a nano-structured metal catalyst at the fuel electrode.41,42 However, it would not be easy to uniformly distribute the catalyst throughout the thick fuel electrode support that has a low porosity, at the cell fabrication stage.43 Infiltration must be applied from the bottom of the fuel electrode support after the cell fabrication is completed; thus, the insertion of catalysts near the electrolyte and fuel–electrode interface is challenging. It can be a concern considering that the functioning electrode of the electrochemical reaction is near the electrolyte/fuel electrode interface.
In this study, on the other hand, metal catalyst insertion was carried out by multi-layer deposition. In the TF-SOC, the FEFL can be formed by layer-by-layer deposition; a thin-film (TF) electrolyte is deposited on the FEFL afterward. This means that the metal catalyst can be positioned near the electrolyte/fuel electrode interface as long as the surface conditions of the FEFL are appropriate for the deposition of a thin and gas-impermeable electrolyte. By applying TF deposition, moreover, the amount and position of the catalyst can be controlled easily by varying the thickness of the catalyst layer and changing the multi-layer configuration.
The optimal conditions of the FEFL with the metal catalyst can be defined as follows. First, the surface of the FEFL should be sufficiently smooth for electrolyte deposition. If the surface of the FEFL after catalyst insertion contains significant roughness and large pores, an appropriate TF electrolyte cannot be deposited because severe microstructural defects such as pin-holes or cracks in the electrolyte are easily generated.44 Second, the catalyst layer should be positioned near the electrolyte/fuel electrode interface to maximize the effect of the catalyst toward the electrochemical reaction. Third, the inserted metal catalyst layer should not induce significant structural defects such as delamination at the FEFL.
Considering the first requirement, the catalyst layer should not be positioned at the top surface of the FEFL. The TF electrolyte is deposited at an elevated temperature (700 °C); therefore, the as-deposited metal catalyst layer would agglomerate prior to electrolyte deposition while ramping the deposition temperature. This results in the intolerable roughness of the TF electrolyte. Moreover, the adhesion between the metal catalyst and the oxide electrolyte is extremely poor, which induces significant structural defects at the interface. That is why we selected NiO–YSZ for the top layer of the FEFL. The top NiO–YSZ not only covers the roughness induced by metal catalyst (Pd) agglomeration, but also establishes a bridge with the NiO–YSZ layer underneath the Pd layer upon post-annealing.
For the second requirement, we fixed the thickness of the top NiO–YSZ layer as 500 nm to place the catalyst close to the electrolyte/fuel electrode interface, as can be seen in Table 1. For the third requirement, the thickness of the Pd layer was varied and the configuration of the multi-layer was changed.
3.2. Microstructure optimization of the Pd-inserted FEFL
The thickness of a nano-structured FEFL should be 2–3 μm.32,36,45 To check the surface and cross-sectional microstructures, the bottom NiO–YSZ thickness was fixed as 500 nm for the C1 and C2 configurations. In the C1 configuration, a 60 nm-thick Pd layer was deposited between 500 nm-thick NiO–YSZ layers. In the C2 configuration, the thickness of the Pd layer was 30 nm. The surface and cross-sectional microstructures after post-annealing at 1200 °C for 1 h and cross-sectional microstructure after reduction at 600 °C for 10 h in 4% H2/Ar are displayed in Fig. 2 for each configuration. It can be seen in Fig. 2(a–c) that significant surface roughness and continuous delamination have been induced in C1, and both indicate that the Pd layer is too thick. If the thickness of the upper NiO–YSZ layer increases, the surface roughness can be mitigated; however, this defies the second requirement. When the thickness of the Pd layer is decreased to half (30 nm) in C2, the surface conditions are much improved, as are the cross-sectional structures (Fig. 2(d) and (e)). The surface is flat and dense, which is appropriate for the subsequent TF electrolyte deposition; the cross section indicates that the bridge between the top and bottom NiO–YSZ layers was established.
 Fig. 2  (a), (d) Surface; (b), (e) cross-sectional morphology of an FEFL thin film after post-annealing at 1200 °C for 1 h; (c), (f) cross-sectional morphology of the FEFL film after reduction at 650 °C for 10 h in 4% H2/Ar of C1 and C2, respectively. 
To investigate whether the C2 configuration is valid for the actual TF-SOC, the C3 configuration with 30 nm-thick Pd inserted in the middle of 2 μm-thick NiO–YSZ was fabricated, as displayed in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a–c) show similar structures to those of C2, demonstrating a smooth and dense surface and connected layers in the FEFL cross section. Consequently, full cell fabrication and fuel cell testing were performed; a high OCV of 1.12 V and a peak power density reaching 1.3 W cm−2 at 600 °C (Fig. S2†) were obtained, which indicate that the surface conditions of the FEFL were appropriate for the TF electrolyte. However, when the cross section of the cell with the C3 FEFL was observed after the fuel cell test, a severe, continuous delamination at the position of Pd insertion was detected, as shown in Fig. 3(d). This implies that the 30 nm-thick Pd layer is also too thick and delamination would eventually occur.

Since a 30 nm-thick Pd layer corresponds to 0.45 mg cm−2 Pd loading, which is a smaller amount than that required for the infiltration process,41,42,46 further reduction of the total amount of Pd is considered to be undesirable. Hence, we split one 30 nm-thick Pd layer to two 15 nm-thick Pd layers and placed those 500 nm apart (C4 configuration). The SEM micrographs of C4 are shown in Fig. 4. The smoothness of the FEFL surface was improved and the cross section of the FEFL was greatly enhanced. The interfaces between the multiple layers of the FEFL were hardly discernible. In fuel cell testing, a high OCV of 1.11 and a peak power density reaching 1.45 W cm−2 at 600 °C (Fig. S2†) were obtained, which indicate that the C4 configuration is suitable for the TF electrolyte. In Fig. 4(d), the cross-sectional microstructure of the C4 FEFL applied TF-SOC after the cell test is displayed. In this figure, each component layer shows fair adhesion at the interfaces, and the delamination of the FEFL was not observed. Based on these results, the TF-SOC employing the C4 FEFL was selected to be the Pd-cell for the LT-Co-EC test.

In order to investigate the Pd distribution, the Pd concentration as a function of the distance from the FEFL/anode support interface after post-annealing was studied using SEM-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and the result is shown in Fig. 5. It appears that most Pd was confined at the FEFL upon fabrication. A Pd concentration of 1.54 ± 0.1 wt% was detected in the FEFL and it decreased drastically at the interface of the FEFL and the support. At a depth of 10 μm from the interface, little Pd (0.1 ± 0.08 wt%) was detected. This demonstrates the position control of catalyst insertion by multi-layer deposition upon fabrication. In particular, Pd was confined where it is inserted because the NiO–YSZ layers in the FEFL were dense, and Ni exists as an oxide phase. Thus, Pd could not diffuse easily.
 Fig. 5  Pd distribution at the anode after post-annealing. 
However, after the cell test, the Pd distribution changed. In Fig. 6(a), the Pd distribution at the fuel electrode after the cell test is shown. It can be seen that Pd diffused to a depth of 40 μm in the substrate. To investigate at what stage the Pd diffusion occurs, the Pd distribution after the reduction immediately after the post-annealing of the C4 FEFL was also probed (Fig. 6(b)). It shows a similar distribution to that of Fig. 6(a); hence, it appears that Pd diffusion occurs during reduction of the fuel electrode before the cell test. The generation of pores and metallic Ni due to reduction is considered to be the main pathway for Pd diffusion. This Pd distribution upon LT-Co-EC testing is believed to affect the reaction mechanism, and is discussed in the following section.
 Fig. 6  Pd concentration as a function of depth of anode support (a) after LT-Co-EC test and (b) after reduction. 
To analyze how Pd exists in the FEFL, TEM-EDX was carried out. High-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images were obtained for in-depth chemical characterization, as shown in Fig. 7. The bright particles in Fig. 7(a) are Ni and the dark particles are zirconia. EDX spectra were collected at area 1 (Ni particle) and area 2 (zirconia particle) and are displayed in Fig. 7(b) and (c), respectively. It can be seen that Pd was dispersed only in the Ni particle, forming Pd–Ni alloys.47 This can be shown in more detail in the TEM-EDX elemental mappings in Fig. 7(d). Pd appears to be uniformly distributed in the Ni grain but not in the zirconia grain. Based on thermodynamics, it can be concluded that Pd is soluble in Ni at the temperatures of reduction and operation of LT-Co-EC (∼600 °C). This result is also in agreement with a previous study.41
 Fig. 7  (a) TEM HAADF image and (b and c) EDS patterns obtained at the positions marked as 1 and 2 in (a), respectively. (d) Compositional mapping results of a part of (a). 
A selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and a high-resolution-TEM (HR-TEM) image obtained from the marked area 1 in Fig. 7(a) are shown in ESI† Fig. S3(a) and S3(b), respectively. The structure is face centered cubic (FCC), and has a lattice spacing of 0.174 nm and 0.205 nm which corresponds to the (200) and the (111) spacing of Ni (0.179 nm and 0.207 nm), respectively (JCPDS File #4-0850). Since both Pd and Ni have an FCC structure and the amount of Pd is substantially small (0.50 ± 0.05 at% according to the TEM-EDS), Pd forms a complete solid solution with Ni and the lattice structure and parameter of the Pd–Ni alloy are similar to those of Ni. Considering the lattice parameter of Pd and Ni (3.890 and 3.523 Å, respectively (Pd (JCPDS File #46-1043) and Ni (JCPDS File #4-0850)) and the amount of Pd incorporation, the lattice parameter of the Pd–Ni alloy is ∼3.527 Å, which is a very close value to that of Ni. Therefore, the EDX data shown in Fig. 7(b) and (c) serve as evidence of the Pd incorporation, not the SAED and HR-TEM images.
3.3. 
          I–V characteristics of LT-Co-EC
Before starting the LT-Co-EC measurement, both the Ref-cell and Pd-cell were subjected to fuel cell testing to confirm that the cells were appropriate for Co-EC testing. Fig. 8 illustrates the I–V–power density (I–V–P) curves and EIS of the cells operating in FC mode at 600 °C. The OCVs of the Ref-cell and the Pd-cell were 1.11 V and 1.09 V, respectively, which are reasonable OCV values for TF-SOFC and indicate that the TF electrolyte was fabricated with microstructural integrity.33–36,38,39 The peak power densities at 600 °C were 1.04 W cm−2 and 1.19 W cm−2 for the Ref- and Pd-cell, respectively. These performances are lower than those in our previous report35 because in the Co-EC testing set-up, the optimized current collection configuration for TF-SOCs was not employed.35,39 The present cell performance is in agreement with another study without using the optimized testing set-up,48 which indicates that both cells have reasonable quality for LT-Co-EC testing without major flaws.

When the performances of both cells are compared, it appears that the reason for the difference in performance mainly originates from the concentration loss in the high-current density regime, based on the I–V–P curve shape. The EIS data obtained at OCV at 600 °C are shown in Fig. 8(b) and (c) (Nyquist plots and Bode plots, respectively). The two cells exhibit similar ohmic area specific resistance (ASR), which is an expected result unless there is a significant contact issue in the test set-up. The polarization ASR of the Pd-cell is smaller than that of the Ref-cell, especially at frequencies lower than 10 Hz. It cannot be conclusively stated because the OCV values are slightly different for the two cells, but considering that this frequency regime is mainly related to gas diffusion,33 it appears that both I–V–P and EIS indicate that gas diffusion is only slightly hampered in the Ref-cell relative to the Pd-cell. Since the only difference is the FEFL for the cells, we speculate that the discrete multi-layer deposition for Pd insertion in the FEFL facilitated the gas diffusion to a certain extent. During the deposition of multiple layers in the FEFL, the as-deposited Pd layer agglomerates prior to the NiO–YSZ deposition performed at 700 °C. The connection of the YSZ skeleton at the top and bottom NiO–YSZ layers would be formed in the area where Pd does not exist, which leads to opening of the YSZ network. This may facilitate the mass transport. It also appears that the Pd-cell exhibited lower impedance in the frequency regime of 102 Hz ≤ f ≤ 103 Hz, which is thought to be related to the catalytic activity of Pd.
The I–V and EIS characteristics were measured for LT-Co-EC as a function of temperature. The operating temperature was changed from 500 °C to 600 °C. The I–V curves of the two cells for steam–CO2 co-electrolysis measured with a reactant gas composition of 30% H2O–30% CO2–10% H2–30% Ar are displayed in Fig. 9. The current densities at 1.4 V of the Pd-cell at 600 °C, 550 °C, and 500 °C reach 0.9 A cm−2, 0.6 A cm−2, and 0.3 A cm−2, respectively, and those of the Ref-cell are 0.8 A cm−2, 0.5 A cm−2, and 0.3 A cm−2 at 600 °C, 550 °C, and 500 °C, respectively. Except at 500 °C, the Pd-cell exhibits a better performance than the Ref-cell. At all temperatures, the slope of the I–V curves changes at low and high current densities. At 600 °C, the slope changes start at 0.3 A cm−2 for the Ref-cell and 0.5 A cm−2 for the Pd-cell while at 550 °C, these values are 0.1 A cm−2 and 0.3 A cm−2 for the Ref-cell and Pd-cell, respectively. The points where the slope changed are indicated by arrows. It can be seen that at 600 °C and 550 °C (Fig. 9(a) and (b)), the slope of the Pd-cell is smaller than that of the Ref-cell in the low-current density region and the main difference originates from this. In the high-current density regime, the difference generated in the low-current density regime remains and no significant difference in terms of the I–V slope of each cell is observed. This indicates that the Pd-cell has lower activation polarizations than the Ref-cell. As was demonstrated in the previous section, Pd incorporation results in the formation of a nano-structured Ni–Pd alloy near the electrode/electrolyte interface and this may enhance the catalyst activity of the metallic catalyst at the FEFL, leading to suppression of the activation polarization at 550 and 600 °C. However, at 500 °C there is no significant performance difference between the Pd-cell and the Ref-cell, which may imply that at this low temperature, Pd does not effectively enhance the electrochemical performance. The origin of this phenomenon is not clear at the present stage and the exact mechanism needs further study.

EIS measured at OCVs (Fig. S4†) indicated that the ohmic ASRs of each cell are similar and the Pd-cell has lower polarization ASRs over the overall frequency range. To clearly understand the mechanism that causes differences in cell performance, the bias conditions in two current density regimes with different slopes were selected at each temperature and EIS measurements were performed. The conditions are indicated with the square marks in the I–V curves (Fig. 9), and the results are displayed in Fig. 10. The impedance in the frequency regime of 10 Hz ≤ f ≤ 103 Hz is the major contributor, as can be seen from Fig. 10, which mostly concerns the surface-related electrode reaction. The Pd-cell exhibits lower resistance than the Ref-cell under all bias conditions and at all operating temperatures. The peak frequency ranges are slightly different between high and low current densities, i.e., at low current densities, the peak frequency appears in a lower frequency range; this phenomenon leads to a larger frequency shift due to the change in resistance (larger resistance, lower frequency).

In the fuel cell mode analyses shown in Fig. 8, gas diffusion is more pronounced in the Ref-cell. Thus, there was a certain concern regarding gas diffusion in LT-Co-EC. LT-Co-EC performance difference occurs at low current densities, and a comparison of Fig. 10(a) and (c) shows that there is a minor difference in the very low-frequency regime (≤1 Hz), corresponding to gas diffusion. Therefore, it can be concluded that the surface reaction enhancement due to Pd incorporation is the main contributor to the performance enhancement. Comparing the microstructure shown in Fig. 7 and those in the FEFL only containing Ni in previous reports,45,49 the morphologies of Pd–Ni grains and Ni grains in each FEFL are almost identical, in terms of the size and distribution. The comparison is presented in Fig. S5.† Therefore, it is postulated that the catalyst activity of Ni is improved by Pd incorporation by forming the Ni–Pd alloy, resulting in the enhancement of the surface reaction, and this result is consistent with a previous report performed on HT-Co-EC.41
3.4. Gas product analyses of LT-Co-EC
In this section, the compositions of gas produced by the Pd-cell and the Ref-cell operating in the LT-Co-EC mode were analyzed by GC and MS. In Fig. 11, H2 and CO concentrations obtained by the Pd- and Ref-cells with 30% H2O–30% CO2–10% H2–30% Ar as the fuel supply are compared, at each LT-Co-EC temperature. As the temperature decreases, the gas yield naturally decreases. A clear trend is that more H2 was produced in the Pd-cell operation, while CO production was higher in the Ref-cell operation; this difference was more pronounced at 600 °C. The difference between the Pd-cell and the Ref-cell in terms of gas production decreased as the temperature decreased, which also indicates that the enhancement of the catalytic activity by Pd addition was not significant at lower temperatures, as shown in the I–V analyses in the previous section.
 Fig. 11  Syngas compositions produced by using the Pd-cell and Ref-cell as a function of current density at (a) 600 °C, (b) 550 °C, and (c) 500 °C. 
In Fig. 11(a), the gas production increases as the current density increases. This indicates that the electrochemical reaction involved the following reactions: H2O (g) + 2e− → H2 (g) + O2−(1-1) CO2 (g) + 2e− → CO (g) + O2−(1-2)
However, the production of CO did not change as much as H2 as a function of the current density; therefore, CO production by (1-2) exists, but is not abundant.
Another observation is that the slope of the gas yield as a function of current density is not different between the Pd-cell and the Ref-cell. This means that the main electrochemical mechanism is not different. In addition, if only the electrochemical reaction, i.e., electrolysis, occurred, then the H2 and the CO concentration should be identical for both cells at the same current density; however, this is not the case. Therefore, a reaction other than the electrochemical reaction occurs in the Pd-cell that produces more H2 but less CO.
Since CO2 and H2 are supplied together, CO will be initially produced by the RWGS reaction (reverse reaction of (4)) to meet the chemical equilibrium:CO2 (g) + H2 (g) → CO (g) + H2O (g)
From (1-2) and the RWGS reaction, CO can be produced.
However, at temperatures below 810 °C, the WGS is more favorable than the RWGS.25 Pd addition can increase the reaction rate by increasing the surface reaction, which can contribute to the thermochemical reaction and the electrochemical reaction shown in the previous section. Therefore, the WGS (forward reaction of (4)) is promoted more in the Pd-cell than in the Ref-cell:CO (g) + H2O (g) → CO2 (g) + H2 (g)
Thus, the CO produced will be consumed and more H2 is generated in the Pd-cell, which can be the reason for the result shown in Fig. 11(a).
According to the thermodynamics, the CH4 content gradually rose with reducing temperature, as mentioned in the introduction. Fig. 12 illustrates the CH4 production detected for both cells at each temperature. Actually, CH4 was produced, but only in a minute amount. Still, one can observe that CH4 formation is higher for the Ref-cell, especially at lower temperatures. CH4 can be formed by methanation, the reverse reaction of (5):3H2 (g) + CO (g) → CH4 (g) + H2O (g)
 Fig. 12  Methane production by using the Pd-cell and Ref-cell measured at various temperatures. 
It appears that Pd suppresses the reaction shown above. One reason can be that since Pd promotes the consumption of CO by WGS, the reactant would be depleted for the above reaction. Another possible explanation is that Pd is known as a catalyst that enhances the steam reforming of methane, leading to the suppression of methane formation with Pd incorporation.50,51
Pd appears to improve the WGS reaction by promoting H2 production and CO consumption and suppressing methane formation. This occurs with the ASR reduction in the electrochemical reaction. Since Pd resides near the electrolyte/electrode interface (and at a depth of several tens of microns toward the anode support, as shown in Fig. 6), the contribution to both electrochemical and thermochemical reactions appears to be possible with a small Pd loading of 0.45 mg cm−2, smaller than the loading in the infiltration process.46
Another beneficial influence of Pd incorporation was unexpectedly discovered after LT-Co-EC operation. The Pd-cell and the Ref-cell were subjected to the fuel cell test again after the 3 day-long LT-Co-EC testing to check the stability of the cell performance. It was noticed that the performance degraded substantially for the Ref-cell, while there was negligible performance change in the Pd-cell, as shown in Fig. 13(a). After observing fractured cross-sectional SEM images of both cells, defects at the electrolyte/fuel electrode interface were suspected in the Ref-cell. To confirm the difference, FIB-SEM observation of both cells was performed. The results are shown in Fig. 13(b) and (c). In the Ref-cell, an array of pores appeared in the vicinity of the fuel electrode/electrolyte interface. These defects were never observed in previous studies after fuel cell tests that lasted several days.35,39,52 The defects were also not generated in the Pd-cell, as shown in Fig. 13(c). Fig. 13(c) shows that there is no obvious delamination by Pd insertion even after long-duration LT-Co-EC as well. This result again supports the fair interface strength of the C4 FEFL structure shown in Fig. 4(d).
 Fig. 13  (a) I–V–P curves of a fuel cell test before and after the LT-Co-EC testing at 600 °C; (b and c) FIB-SEM observation of the Ref-cell and Pd-cell after LT-Co-EC testing, respectively. 
The origin of this difference is not clear at the present stage, but one possibility is that Pd incorporation reduced the driving force of Ni agglomeration, moving Ni from the interface down to the support. Under the Co-EC mode, the driving force for Ni agglomeration can be higher than that in the FC mode, because considerably more steam was supplied at the fuel electrode side. Forming the Ni–Pd alloy may reduce the driving force for Ni agglomeration. There have been reports on the reduction of agglomeration by alloying the metal catalyst used in SOFCs.47,53,54 In fact, it was observed that the pores of the FEFL below the pore array in the Ref-cell were filled with Ni, which has a denser structure than the FEFL of the Pd-cell. In the I–V–P curve shown in Fig. 13(a), the gas diffusion and the ohmic loss deteriorated for the Ref-cell after operation, which may originate from this probable cause. Another possibility is that the inferior catalytic activity of the FEFL of the Ref-cell led to pressure build-up at the interface, pushing Ni away. However, considering that a major portion of the reactant does not participate in the reaction in both cells, therefore, it can be seen that the assumption about pressure build-up seems unlikely. Although the exact mechanism needs further study to be elucidated, this result indicates that Pd incorporation plays an important role in maintaining the microstructural integrity of the FEFL and can improve the operating stability of the TF-SOC.
4. Conclusions
In the present study, multi-layer thin-film deposition was employed to incorporate a Pd catalyst at the FEFL of a TF-SOC and its impact on LT-Co-EC was investigated. An appropriate multi-layer FEFL configuration is defined based on surface smoothness sufficient for thin electrolyte deposition and the structural integrity of the FEFL (no delamination at the inserted Pd layer). The inserted Pd is confined at the FEFL during cell fabrication but appears to diffuse toward the anode support to several tens of microns during reduction prior to cell testing, which affects both the electrochemical and thermochemical reactions of LT-Co-EC. The electrochemical performance is improved by inserting the Pd catalyst near the interface of the electrolyte and the nanostructured FEFL, especially at operating temperatures of 600 °C and 550 °C. The EIS analyses reveal that the surface electrode reaction is improved by Pd incorporation, which is attributed to the improved surface catalytic activity caused by Pd–Ni alloying. By analyzing the gas produced, it is found that Pd incorporation promotes H2 production and CO consumption, while it suppresses methane formation. It is postulated that the presence of Pd at a depth of several tens of microns in the substrate promotes the WGS reaction, and as a result, methanation is suppressed due to CO depletion. The performance stability of the Pd-cell is superior to that of the Ref-cell after the LT-Co-EC test, and Pd insertion is found to be effective to retain the microstructural quality of the electrolyte/FEFL interface.
Catalyst insertion by multi-layer thin film deposition shows potential in (1) controlling the position and amount of catalyst incorporation; (2) improving electrode reactions that are effective at the electrolyte/electrode interface with a relatively small amount of catalyst; and (3) enhancing the catalytic activity and the structural stability of the fuel catalyst by alloying. Although the limitation of electrolysis at low temperatures cannot be entirely overcome by using the catalyst and thin-film technology, the present results suggest an effective method and positive influence of heterogeneous catalyst insertion on TF-SOCs.
