    , Accepted 16th July 2012First published on 17th July 2012AbstractDonor–acceptor molecules with small chain extension have been synthesized and used as active material in organic solar cells. The effect of fusion of a phenyl group on the end dicyanovinylene acceptor is discussed.
Organic photovoltaic cells (OPV) offer the possibility to develop lightweight and cost effective solar cells by means of low environmental impact technology. Although low band gap processable conjugated polymers remain a major class of donor materials for OPV,1–4 the past few years have witnessed the growing importance acquired by donors based on small molecules.5,6 Besides the obvious advantages of perfectly defined chemical structures in terms of reproducibility of synthesis, purification and performances, molecular donors allow a more straightforward analysis of structure–property relationships than polydisperse polymers. In recent years this approach has generated a huge amount of work and many new classes of molecular donors have been synthesized and evaluated.5–18
The structure of efficient molecular donors generally involves a combination of donor and acceptor blocks in order to create an internal charge transfer (ICT) which produces at the same time an extension of the absorption spectrum towards longer wavelengths and a decrease of the HOMO level which results in an increase in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the OPV cell.7 Although interesting results have been obtained with different classes of molecular donors5–18 such as triphenylamines,7,8 oligothiophenes,9–12 squaraines,13 diketopyrrolopyrroles14 or borondipyrromethenes,15 these materials are in general based on rather large molecules of high molecular weight.
In this context, the question of the size of the donor molecule appears as an interesting problem. In fact, recent work has shown that interesting photovoltaic performances could be obtained with molecular donors of limited spatial extension and molecular weight.17,18 In fact, the question of the minimal size of the donor is not trivial and could have important implications regarding some economic aspects of future industrial production of active materials for OPV.
We report here preliminary results on small molecular donors 1 and 2 combining a triphenylamine donor block (TPA) with a dicyanovinyl thiophene electron acceptor group. In an attempt to modulate the characteristics of the ICT,7 the dicyanovinyl group has been fused to the thiophene by a phenyl ring (2). The synthesis of these compounds is described and a comparative analysis of their performances in simple OPV cells is presented.
The synthesis of compounds 119 and 2 is shown in Scheme 1. A Stille coupling between the commercial bromo derivative of triphenylamine (TPA) (5) and 2-(tri-n-butylstannyl)thiophene gave compound 4 (52% yield) which was subsequently subjected to Vilsmeier formylation to give aldehyde 3 in 74% yield. The target compound 1 was then obtained in 75% yield by Knoevenagel condensation of 3 with malononitrile.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of compounds 1 and 2. 
A Stille coupling of the stannyl compound 6, obtained by reacting bromo-TPA (5) with n-BuLi at low temperature followed by addition of Bu3SnCl,20 with the key bromo derivative 7 (see ESI†) in the presence of a palladium catalyst gave the target compound 2 in 87% yield.
The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of 1 shows two maxima in the 300–400 nm region and an intense absorption band with a maximum at 501 nm assigned to an ICT band (Fig. 1).7 Comparison with the spectrum of 2 shows that introduction of a fused phenyl ring in the acceptor block produces a red shift of the maximum of the ICT band to 610 nm together with a decrease in its relative intensity with a ca. twofold decrease in the molecular absorption coefficient (ε) (Table 1).

Thermal analysis by DSC and TGA measured at 10 °C min−1 under N2 shows that the bridging of the acceptor unit in 2 leads to a significant increase in melting point (127–129 °C for 1 and 249–251 °C for 2) and improves thermal stability as deduced from the decomposition temperatures determined at 5% weight loss (292 °C for 1 and 334 °C for 2, see ESI†).
The crystal structure of compound 2 shows that except for the two phenyl groups of the TPA unit, the conjugated system adopts a planar geometry, whereas the molecular packing exhibits a head-to-tail arrangement as generally observed for strongly dipolar molecules17b,c,18 with a distance of 3.40 Å between the planes of two neighbouring molecules (Fig. 2).

Cyclic voltammetry performed in CH2Cl2 in the presence of Bu4NPF6 as a supporting electrolyte shows that compounds are reversibly oxidized into the corresponding cation-radical with an identical anodic peak potential (Epa) of 1.00 V vs. SCE (see ESI†, Fig. S4).
Compound 1 undergoes an irreversible reduction with a cathodic peak potential Epc at −1.23 V while compound 2 is reversibly reduced with an Epc of −0.80 V. This 430 mV positive shift of Epc shows that the fusion with a phenyl ring produces a huge decrease of the LUMO level of the molecule (Table 1). This effect could be related to the stabilization of the anion-radical of 2 by aromatization of the cyclopentadiene ring.
Compounds 1 and 2 have been used as donor material in bilayer planar heterojunction solar cells. The cells of 0.28 cm2 area were fabricated using the already described procedures20 (see ESI†). In spite of the absence of solubilising groups, the donors were soluble enough for solution-processing. The donor layer of 35 nm thickness was spun-cast from chloroform solutions of 1 or 2 (10 mg mL−1) on ITO substrates pre-coated by a 40 nm layer of PEDOT:PSS. A 30 nm layer of C60 was then deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum and the devices were completed by vacuum deposition of a 100 nm aluminium electrode.

Fig. 3 shows the external conversion efficiency (EQE) spectra of the two types of cells under monochromatic irradiation. The spectrum of the cell based on donor 1 shows a broad wave extending from 350 to 650 nm with a maximum of 45% at around 530 nm. For the cell based on 2 the spectrum shows a first maximum at ca. 460 nm followed by a second broad band extending from 550 to ca. 820 nm. The EQE spectrum is consistent with the red shifted ICT band observed in the UV-Vis spectrum of donor 2 (Fig. 1), although the relative contribution of the ICT band to the photocurrent is smaller than expected. The current density vs. voltage curves recorded in the dark and under simulated solar irradiation under AM 1.5 conditions are shown in Fig. 4. The cell based on donor 1 gave a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 5.03 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.85 V. Combined with a filling factor (FF) of 43%, these data lead to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.04%. A five minute annealing at 120 °C produced a substantial increase in Jsc and Voc leading to a PCE of 2.53% (Table 2).

The results obtained with donor 2 show that the as-fabricated cell presents the same Voc of 0.85 V, as expected from the identical HOMO level, but smaller initial values of Jsc, FF and PCE. However, a five minute thermal treatment produces a large increase in these values with a PCE close to 3.00%.
To summarize we have shown that the covalent bridging of the dicyanovinyl thiophene acceptor group by a phenyl ring represents an efficient synthetic approach for engineering the ICT and the LUMO energy level of donor materials based on dipolar small donor–acceptor molecules.
Taking into account the simplicity of the devices used for evaluation, these preliminary results suggest that the use of C70 as an acceptor and of more advanced technology for device fabrication can be expected to lead to higher performances. Work aiming at the extension of these ideas is now in progress and will be reported in future publications.
