    , Accepted 17th May 2022First published on 17th May 2022AbstractRecently, conjugated donor–acceptor block copolymers (CDABPs) were synthesized by one-pot polymerization and applied in polymer solar cells with a single-component active layer. These polymers can suppress phase separation and exhibit inert internal morphologies compared to the polymer blends; however, their thermal stability remains an issue to be addressed. In this study, we successfully synthesized a new crosslinkable CDABP (P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T)), comprising a donor block bearing photocrosslinkable oxetane side chains and an acceptor block to improve the thermal and morphological properties. The crosslinked P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) film showed high solvent resistance, and it was confirmed that even the P(NDI2T) block without a crosslinking unit did not dissolve after washing with a solvent. This indicates that the P(NDI2T) block was obviously covalently bonded to the P(OXBTT) donor block in the CDABP structure. In particular, compared to the blend (P(OXBTT) and P(NDI2T)) film, the P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) film exhibited a uniform surface morphology. Consequently, the polymer solar cell based on the crosslinked P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) active layer showed higher power conversion efficiency and better thermal stability than that based on the blend film.
1. Introduction
Recently, many studies have been conducted on all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) because of their high efficiency and high mechanical stability, which make them suitable for future flexible photovoltaic devices.1–5 In a polymer–polymer blend system, morphology control is a critical issue that significantly affects device performance.6–13
The morphology of the blend film can vary according to the temperature, environmental conditions, and miscibility of the two polymers. Single-component polymers such as double-cable polymers and conjugated donor–acceptor block copolymers (CDABPs) have been proposed for use in many strategies.14–21 CDABPs reduce the large phase separation of donor and acceptor domains through the improvement of internal morphology, facilitate the fabrication of single-component polymer solar cells (SCPSCs).22–24
In several studies, CDABPs were synthesized through one-pot polymerization, in which a crystallizable donor and acceptor macromolecular units are introduced into the same polymer chain to solve the miscibility problem and tune charge transport properties. Consequently, the corresponding SCPSCs showed highly improved performance efficiency and mechanical stability.25–28 Moreover, various monomers for donor and acceptor blocks have been proposed and applied in CDABP synthesis.29–33 However, it is challenging to verify whether all the blocks were introduced into the block copolymer. Because unreacted blocks are also macromolecular monomeric species, they are difficult to remove using a typical purification process, such as Soxhlet extraction.
In general, crosslinking strategies have been addressed in the literature to ameliorate the stability issues of PSCs.34–37 To improve the stability of PSC efficiency, a method using a main-chain conjugated copolymer in which a crosslinking group is bonded to a side chain is known. This strategy is closely related to the internal morphological stability of the active layer of PSCs. When a conjugated polymer with a crosslinkable moiety is subjected to optimal thermal annealing or light illumination, its internal morphology can be frozen, while maintaining its intrinsic semiconducting properties.
Compared to other crosslinkable groups, the oxetane group has relatively strong hydrophilicity owing to the presence of heterocyclic compounds with oxygen.38–40 This may cause phase separation when mixing a polymer with oxetane and a hydrophobic polymer. Therefore, a new molecular design strategy is required to achieve high polymer–polymer miscibility.
In this work, we first reported a new CDABP (P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T)) bearing crosslinking groups to minimize phase separation and secure thermal stability of the internal morphology through crosslinking (P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T)), which consists of a donor block (P(OXBTT)) bearing photocrosslinkable oxetane side chains and an acceptor block (P(ND2T)), was easily synthesized through one-pot polymerization. Compared to the blend film of P(OXBTT) and P(NDI2T), the P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) film showed the uniform surface morphology and a completely formed network structure through a photocrosslinking reaction. Notably, in the washed 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) solution of the crosslinked P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) film, unreacted P(NDI2T) blocks were rarely observed. This indicated that P(NDI2T) blocks were introduced into the block copolymer. This result indicates that most of the donor and acceptor blocks were covalently bonded without unreacted residual blocks, similar to previously reported block copolymers synthesized by one-pot polymerization. The corresponding SCPSC device fabricated with the P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) film exhibited a relatively high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and excellent thermal stability compared to the all-PSC device based on the P(OXBTT):P(NDI2T) blend film.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) bearing a wide-bandgap P(OXBTT) as a polymeric donor block and narrow-bandgap P(NDI2T) as a polymeric acceptor block was synthesized using a one-pot polymerization method reported in our previous studies.25–27 The synthetic pathway and desired structure of P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) are illustrated in Scheme 1. First, an intermediate P(NDI2T) block was synthesized via general Stille coupling polymerization using M1 and M2 monomers. After 7 h, a blended solution of M3 and M4 monomers for the P(OXBTT) block was quickly added to the reaction solution, and the mixture was stirred for additional 48 h. The residual oligomers were eliminated through successive Soxhlet extractions with acetone, hexane, and methylene chloride (MC). P(OXBTT) and P(NDI2T) were also synthesized as reference polymers. All the polymers showed good solubilities in MC, chloroform, and halogenated aromatic solvents. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of the synthesized polymers were measured using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and the results are shown in Fig. S4.† The Mn and polydispersity indexes (PDIs) were 23.7 kDa and 2.32 for intermediate P(NDI2T), and 29.1 kDa and 2.55 for final P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T), respectively. 1H NMR spectra were obtained to confirm the chemical structure of P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) (Fig. S3†), and an attempt was made to determine the composition of the donor and acceptor repeating units through elemental analysis. As nitrogen is present only in the P(NDI2T) acceptor block, the molar ratio of the repeating unit of P(OXBTT) to P(NDI2T) was determined using the nitrogen content of P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) obtained through elemental analysis. The molar ratio of OXBTT to NDI2T was determined to be 1:1 in P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T).
 Scheme 1  One-pot polymerization of P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T): (i) Pd(PPh3)4, toluene/DMF (9:1 v/v), reflux, 7 h; (ii) add M3:M4 blend (molar ratio 1:1) solution, reflux, 48 h. 
The thermal properties of the polymers were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), as shown in Fig. S5.† The thermal decomposition temperatures of P(OXBTT), P(NDI2T), and P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) were 281, 360, and 305 °C, respectively. Compared to P(OXBTT), P(NDI2T) exhibited an apparent melting temperature (Tm) of 296 °C. In particular, the glass transition temperature (Tg) of P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) was observed endothermically at around 242 °C.
2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of all synthesized polymers in the solution and film states are shown in Fig. 1a and b, and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 1. P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) showed three distinct absorption bands: π–π transition band from 300 to 400 nm for the P(NDI2T) block, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band from 450 to 650 nm for the P(OXBTT) block, and ICT band from 650 to 800 nm for the P(NDI2T) block.41–42

Electrochemical properties of the synthesized polymers were examined using cyclic voltammetry. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were calculated from the oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively (Fig. 1c). The corresponding energy levels are listed in Table 1. The onset potentials of oxidation/reduction were determined to be +0.84/−0.80 V for P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T), yielding HOMO/LUMO of −5.30/−3.66 eV.
The HOMO and LUMO levels of P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) polymer were measured differently from the HOMO and LUMO levels of P(OXBTT) and P(NDI2T), respectively. This is expected because the donor block and the acceptor block are linked through a conjugated bond. As shown in Fig. S6d,† the blend film (P(OXBTT):P(NDI2T) = 1:1) exhibits an oxidation potential almost equal to that of P(OXBTT). This can be evidence that P(OXBTT-co-NDIT2T) is not a blend of P(OXBTT) and P(NDI2T), and that the two blocks are covalently bonded and conjugated.
2.3. Crosslinking ability of the CDABP
We analyzed the structure and crosslinking ability of the CDABP film under UV irradiation (λ = 365 nm). Polymer thin films (e.g., P(OXBTT), P(OXBTT):P(NDI2T) blend, and P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T)) were prepared by spin-coating a polymer solution in chloroform onto glass substrates.
First, we determined the photocrosslinking ability at different (i) UV irradiation times (5, 20, and 60 s), (ii) photoacid generator (PAG, triarylsulfonium hexafluorophosphate) concentrations (1.0 and 2.0 wt%), and (iii) annealing temperatures (150 and 180 °C), as shown in Fig. S8.† After UV irradiation (λ = 365 nm), absorption spectra of the films were obtained after rinsing with ODCB.
Table S2† summarizes the degree of crosslinking of the polymers according to the light- and heat-treatment conditions. The degree of crosslinking was calculated using the absorbance at 555 nm before crosslinking and after rinsing the crosslinked thin films with ODCB. Based on the results, P(OXBTT) was confirmed to form a polymer network under UV irradiation for 5 s at 150 °C and showed >86% degree of crosslinking.
In Fig. 2, we compare the solubility of the P(OXBTT):P(NDI2T) blend film and P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) film with a degree of crosslinking of approximately 80%. In the case of the blend film after UV irradiation, because P(NDI2T) does not contain a crosslinking group, it is physically incorporated into the crosslinked P(OXBTT) network. Thus, with the exception of the P(NDI2T) polymer caging within the P(OXBTT) network, most of the P(ND2T) dissolved during rinsing (Fig. 2a). In Fig. 2b and c, the color and absorption spectrum (filled spectrum) of the solution obtained after rinsing the UV irradiated blend film are quite similar to those of P(NDI2T). In addition, a weak absorption band was observed between 500 and 600 nm, indicating that a small number of isolated P(OXBTT) chains were not crosslinked and thus dissolved.

Meanwhile, by measuring the absorption spectrum of the ODCB solution after rinsing the P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) film, the absorption bands of both the donor and acceptor units were observed, as shown in Fig. 2d. In this case, it is assumed that the reason for the decreased absorbance at 388, 548, and 690 nm is that the uncrosslinked P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) dissolves during rinsing. As shown in Fig. 2e, the absorption spectrum (filled spectrum) of the rinsing solution is very similar to the solution spectrum of low concentration P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T). Also, the color of the rinsing solution was fairly similar to the color of the highly diluted P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) solution, unlike the blend solution. Consequently, it was found that the UV-irradiated P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) film successfully formed a polymer network and had an internal structure different from that of the blend film (schematic in Fig. 2f).
2.4. Performance of crosslinked CDABP-based PSCs
Eventually, we applied the crosslinkable CDABP and blend film in all-PSCs with the inverted device configuration of ITO/ZnO/Active layer/MoO3/Ag. PSCs based on P(OXBTT):P(NDI2T) blend (1:1 wt ratio) and P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) were fabricated by thermal treatment at 150 °C and UV irradiation for 20 s. As-cast blend and CDABP films were used to fabricate reference devices. The current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices with the crosslinked active layer are shown in Fig. 3, and the corresponding device parameters are listed in Table 2. Comparisons of PSCs bearing as-cast and UV-irradiated active layers are shown in Fig. S9 and Table S3.†

The device 2 showed a relatively high PCE of 2.89% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 5.80 mA cm−2, while the device 1 exhibited a relatively low PCE of 1.36% with a low Jsc of 3.13 mA cm−2. To confirm the origin of the significant difference in Jsc, EQE spectra of the two devices were measured.
Compared with the blend film-based device, the crosslinked CDABP film-based device exhibited relatively high photoresponse characteristics in the 300–800 nm region, as shown in Fig. 3c. Therefore, the Jsc value of the CDABP film-based device was higher than that of the blended film-based device.
The morphology of the active layer is a critical factor that can affect device characteristics. The internal morphology of the thin film was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A TEM image of the blend film (Fig. 4a) shows a large phase separation across the entire film. In Fig. 4e, the P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) film showed the further reduced domain sizes and a relatively uniform internal morphology. The surface morphologies of the two active layers were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The blend and P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) films exhibited root-mean-square roughness (Rq) values of 2.415 and 0.690 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4b and f. The larger domain size and Rq value of the blend film resulted from poor miscibility between P(OXBTT) and P(NDI2T), which might be attributed to the fact that P(OXBTT) contains a hydrophilic oxetane group at the end of the side-chain per repeating unit. At the same time, in the present study, this problem was effectively solved by combining two polymers with low miscibility to form a block copolymer. As expected, the P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) film exhibited a highly uniform surface morphology. This can further contribute to efficient exciton generation, diffusion, charge separation, and transport. Therefore, a higher Jsc could be achieved in the case of P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T)-based PSC.

2.5. Performance of crosslinked CDABP-based PSCs
Finally, we investigated the thermal stability of the PSC device performance. The performance of the PSC devices with the UV irradiated active layer was evaluated after aging the films at 80 °C under ambient conditions. As shown in Fig. 5, the PCE of the device with the UV irradiated P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) active layer exhibited only a 2.9% decrease compared with the initial PCE value after thermal aging at 80 °C for 100 min.

In contrast, the PCE of the device with the UV irradiated blend active layer decreased rapidly to 29.4% of the initial value after thermal aging for 100 min. From these results, the UV irradiated P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) film-based device exhibited excellent thermal stability in terms of device efficiency because of the formation of a solid network structure.
Subsequently, the effect of thermal aging on the surface morphologies of the two crosslinked films was investigated. As shown in the inset AFM images in Fig. 5b and d, thermal aging did not significantly affect the surface morphology of the crosslinked P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) film. In contrast, it was confirmed that the domains were separated from each other in the blend film, resulting in a coarser film surface. In the case of P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T), the P(OXBTT) blocks were crosslinked to bind P(NDI2T) blocks after UV irradiation. In contrast, the blend could not bind P(NDI2T) even when P(OXBTT) was crosslinked.
Thus, the excellent thermal stability of the PSC efficiency with the crosslinked P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) film can be attributed to the stable morphology of the crosslinked films owing to the interlocking between the P(OXBTT) blocks.
3. Conclusions
In this work, we report, for the first time, the synthesis of CDABP (P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T)) containing photocrosslinkable oxetane units using one-pot polymerization. It was confirmed that the synthesized P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) had a high crosslinking ability under UV irradiation; the rinsing test revealed that there were almost no unreacted P(NDI2T) blocks in the P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) crosslinked film. In particular, crosslinking of the CDABP film effectively reduced the phase separation between the relatively hydrophilic P(OXBTT) and hydrophobic P(NDI2T). As a result, the PSC based on the crosslinked P(OXBTT-co-NDI2T) film showed better PCE and thermal stability than the crosslinked blend film-based PSC. This result can be considered an effective strategy for the manufacturing of PSCs with excellent thermal stability based on single-component active materials in future studies.
