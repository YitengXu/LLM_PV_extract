    First published on 30th March 2021AbstractThe last few years have seen huge growing interest in the heterogenisation of molecular catalysts since it allows combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyses. Besides bringing recyclability, the immobilisation of the catalyst may increase its stability while allowing tuning its selectivity. In this respect, Metal–Organic Frameworks (MOFs) attract evergrowing interest as a platform for their confinement within their pores or channels. In this review, Cat@MOF composites wherein molecular catalysts (Cats) are immobilised into MOFs through non-covalent interactions with their host are reviewed thoroughly. Polyoxometalates (POMs) and other metal-based complexes as immobilised molecular species are covered. In the first part, the different synthetic methods and analytical tools are described. A critical analysis of the various physico-chemical methods available to characterise the Cat@MOF composites is provided – particular attention being paid toward their pertinence to the investigation of the content, the position and the stability of the catalyst within the MOF. Besides, the focus is on non-conventional techniques such as the Pair Distribution Function (PDF) method and a section is dedicated to the contribution of DFT calculations. In the second part, the applications of these materials in the fields of catalysis, including oxidation and reduction reactions, acid–base catalysis, and photo- and electrocatalysis, are detailed.

1. Introduction
Metal-containing molecular species continue to be tremendously studied as homogeneous catalysts. Although most-efficient molecular catalysts are based on noble metals (Pt, Re, Ru, Ir), several classes of noble metal-free catalysts, such as simple earth-abundant coordination metal complexes or polyoxometalates (POMs), covering a large range of catalysis fields, have also been reported. POMs are discrete soluble anionic metal oxide clusters of d-block transition metals in high oxidation states (usually WVI, MoV,VI, VIV,V) which can be described as metal complexes with oxo ligands with a large domain of applications.1,2 In homogenous catalysis, one major drawback of molecular catalysts is their low stability under catalytic conditions as well as their small surface areas. Furthermore, both the recovery and reuse of these molecular catalysts are generally difficult due to their high solubility in polar solvents, associated with the difficulty of their separation from the products. Their immobilisation into rigid matrices such as Metal–Organic Frameworks (MOFs) has thus emerged in recent years as an attractive strategy to address these drawbacks and develop heterogenous catalytic composites. MOFs are a vast class of porous hybrid organic–inorganic crystalline solids built by the connection of metallic ions or clusters with polydentate organic linkers. They have recently proved to be an extremely attractive platform for catalysis,3 with a number of key advantages: (i) their modular porosity allows the diffusion of reactants and products, (ii) their versatile chemical functionalization allows ‘design’ strategies, (iii) they offer improved stability and recyclability unreached so far with homogeneous catalysts and (iv) their crystalline structures facilitate computational and theoretical approaches. In this review, we will give an overview of the composite materials obtained by the immobilisation of known molecular catalysts into the cavities of known MOFs, denoted Cat@MOFs. The vast majority of such Cat@MOF composites reported so far involves mainly POMs and also organometallic and coordination complexes. The present review thus covers these different types of guests, excluding the immobilisation of organic molecules or nanoparticles. We have also excluded hybrid frameworks that do not exist in the absence of their Cat guests, since they may not be considered as genuine heterogenisation platforms. We will also not review catalytic species covalently grafted to the MOF host, either to its linkers or to its inorganic nodes.4–7 Here, we will rather focus on pore-functionalized MOF composites, which involve non-covalent interactions between the hosted moieties and the MOF. One of the first reviews on this subject was written in 2012 by Juan-Alcañiz et al. and covered all the composite materials possessing encapsulated active species ranging from nanoparticles to organometallic species and POMs.8 Since then the literature on the subject has greatly increased and some recent reviews have been published on the specific sub-family of POM@MOFs as heterogeneous catalysts.9,10 We can also mention reviews on POMs and MOF-based electrocatalysts,11 on POM-based MOF materials12 and on POM-functionalized architectures,13 which have devoted a section to POM@MOFs. A number of reviews on MOFs also propose a section dedicated to the immobilisation of molecular catalysts.14–16 Nonetheless, none of these reviews proposes an exhaustive state of the art of Cat@MOF materials as defined above neither a critical analysis of all the characterisation tools available ranging from routine solid state techniques to more sophisticated ones. After a comprehensive list of the Cat@MOF compounds reported in the literature in the form of two tables, one for POM@MOFs and the other for Complex@MOFs, and a description of the various synthetic methods, we will provide a critical discussion on the physicochemical methods available to characterize these composites and of their pertinence to investigating the content, the structural features (including the positioning of the catalyst in the MOF) and the stability of the catalyst within the MOF or of the MOF itself. We will focus on growingly used methods such as the pair distribution function (PDF) method and difference envelope density (DED) analysis and we will give a perspective on how DFT calculations can bring valuable information. Finally, we will present the applications of these materials in the fields of catalysis, including oxidation and reduction reactions, acid–base catalysis, and photo- and electrocatalysis.
2. Synthesis of Cat@MOF composites
Details of various Cat@MOF systems synthesised are gathered in two distinct tables. POM@MOF composites are listed in Table 1 with the formula of the POM, the weight% in catalyst when indicated in the related article, the synthetic method used, including the nature of the solvent, the temperature and the catalytic application considered. Table 2 is dedicated to other types of Complex@MOF materials. In both tables, the composites are listed according to the MOF–host family. We have also included some references on POM@MOFs and Complex@MOFs with no reported applications when they were useful for the discussion on synthesis or characterization.

2.1 Presentation of the host and guest components
MOFs can offer many advantages such as thermal and chemical stability, high surface areas with hierarchical porosity and the possibility of accommodating catalytic guests into their cages or channels. Analysing Tables 1 and 2, it is apparent that MIL-101(Cr) MOF has been by far the most studied porous hybrid solid for hosting Cat species. This may be explained by its facile and effective synthesis in water, its high stability and extra-large cavities (see below). However, the presence of chromium ions – considered as one of the most toxic metal ions – is a significant drawback. MIL-100(Fe) and NH2-MIL-101(Al) have thus also been largely investigated as alternative hosts. Furthermore, Zr-based MOFs appear to be more eco-friendly, and among them, UiO-66 and -67 are the most commonly presented in the literature along with MOF-545 and NU-1000. Finally, HKUST-1 (mostly Cu-based) and Zn-based ZIF-8 are also highly popular hosts. Representations of the main MOFs presented in this review with their formulas and the dimensions of their cavities are given in Fig. 1, followed below by a short description of their structures and stability. Obviously, both the MOF's structure and stability are key parameters to be taken into account when selecting a MOF as a platform to target the immobilisation of catalytic species.
 Fig. 1  Representations of the structures of the main MOF hosts reported in this review with the dimensions of the cavities, and the linker's and MOF's formulas. 
(NH2-)MIL-101(M) (M = CrIII, FeIII, AlIII)17 is built of MIII trimers made of corner-sharing octahedra connected by benzenedicarboxylate (BDC) linkers, leading to the general formula M3O(BDC)3(H2O)2X (X = F, Cl, NO3, OH,…).18 Four metal trimers are linked together by BDC, forming supertetrahedra (ST) interconnected in a corner-sharing fashion to form a hybrid framework with the MTN zeotype topology.19,20 The resulting crystal structure displays two types of mesoporous spherical cages. The smallest ones (20 ST) have an internal free diameter of ∼29 Å and are delimited by 12 pentagonal windows of ∼12 Å free aperture. The largest cages (28 ST) have an internal free diameter of 34 Å and both pentagonal and hexagonal windows, with the latter having an aperture of 14.7 Å × 16 Å.17 MIL-101(M) has a gigantic cell volume of 702000 Å3 and a BET surface area of up to 4500 m2 g−1 upon solvent removal, allowing the hosting of large molecules. Moreover, the functionalisation of MIL-101(M) may be easily achieved via two different procedures: by using substituted BDC linkers (bearing –NH2, –NO2, –SO3 or other functions) as reactants for the MOF synthesis,21 or via post-synthetic linker modifications.22 MIL-101(M)'s stability is highly correlated with the nature of its metal centres and of the BDC's functional groups. While MIL-101(Cr) is highly resistant to water (as solvent, moisture or even steam) and can last several days in boiling water without any structural degradation, MIL-101(Fe) and (Al) homologues show much lower stabilities toward hydrolysis, with for example NH2-MIL-101(Al) transforming into more thermodynamically stable NH2-MIL-53(Al) after only 5 min exposure to water.23 MIL-101(Cr) is also stable to acidic and basic conditions for several weeks and resilient to oxidative conditions (5% H2O2) for a few days. Again, the Al homologue shows, in contrast, poor stability toward acidic or basic conditions, with partial transformation into MIL-53 and high loss of porosity.24
MIL-100,25,26 formulated as M3O(BTC)2(H2O)2X (X = F, Cl, OH,…; M = Al, Fe, Cr), possesses the same topology as MIL-101 with a smaller cell volume of ∼380000 Å3, i.e. built of trimers of corner-sharing metal octahedra connected by benzenetricarboxylate (BTC) linkers (rather than BDC in MIL-101). The smallest cages have an internal diameter of 25 Å and pentagonal windows of ca. 5 Å. The largest cages display an internal diameter of 29 Å and hexagonal windows with a free aperture of 8.6 Å. These two types of cages allow a large surface area of 3100 m2 g−1. MIL-100(Fe) displays high water stability and no degradation after 24 h at 323 K.27 It is stable in most solvents. Still, the thermal stability of MIL-100(M) is highly linked to the metal node's nature, with the solid being stable up to 270, 325 and 370 °C for MIL-100(Fe), MIL-100(Cr) and MIL-100(Al), respectively.28 However, Bezverkhyy et al. showed that MIL-100(Fe) is stable mainly at acidic pH and starts degrading at pH 7.29
UiO-66 (Zr6O4(OH)4(BDC)6) is one of the most studied Zr-based MOFs, attracting also much attention due to its tunable defective structure. First synthetized in 2008,24 it consists of Zr6 oxoclusters connected by BDC linkers, forming octahedral mesoporous cages with a diameter of 11 Å and tetrahedral cages of ∼8 Å internal diameter. The BET surface area is 1200 m2 g−1. Similarly to MIL-101, the functionalization of the BDC ligand leads to a variety of UiO-66's derivatives. The high connectivity (12 linkers per Zr6 unit in the defect-free structure) allows preserving its crystallinity even up to 25% linker defects.176 UiO-66 is stable to water and organic solvents for several weeks and can withstand long exposure to acidic or basic pH at least in the 4 to 12 range. Although it does not show any XRD or BET changes after several weeks under oxidative conditions (5% H2O2), the material lacks stability when exposed to air, leading to its partial destruction after 3 days.177 Stability tests performed on UiO-66-NH2 have shown that the linker functionalization somehow reduces its stability in water but increases its stability in air.
UiO-6724 (Zr6O4(OH)4(bpdc)2) derives from UiO-66, as it incorporates 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylate (BPDC) linkers instead of BDC. This induces an increase in the distances between Zr6 nodes as well as in the sizes of pores and windows. UiO-67 is thus composed of octahedral and tetrahedral cages of 18 Å and 11.5 Å internal diameters, respectively, while exhibiting 3000 m2 g−1 BET surface area.24 UiO-67 is notably less stable than UiO-66, with a decrease in porosity after 3 days in a pH 4–12 aqueous solution and even in air/moisture, and a total destruction in 5% H2O2.177
MOF-545 (Zr6O8(H2O)8(TCPP)2),178 also known as PCN-222,179 is also a Zr-MOF which incorporates tetrakis(4-carboxy-phenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) ligands. In MOF-545, the TCPP linkers are bound to four distinct Zr6 clusters located on two different layers, creating two distinct types of channels, large hexagonal ones of 36 Å diameter and smaller triangular channels, providing a total BET surface area of ∼2300 m2 g−1. The large size of hexagonal channels allows easy post-synthetic impregnation of various molecules. Moreover, the photosensitivity of TCPP and its possible metalation endow this hybrid solid with interesting properties for photocatalytic reactions such as CO2 reduction or water splitting (see below).108,180 MOF-545 is stable to organic solvents and highly stable in water even under very acidic conditions (concentrated HCl solution) but decomposes at pH above 10.179
Another Zr-based MOF we will focus on in this review is NU-1000.181 It is synthesised by reaction of a Zr precursor with 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(p-benzoic-acid)pyrene (H4TBAPy) under solvothermal conditions. In Zr6O8(H2O)8(TBAPy)2, the Zr6 oxoclusters are linked via TBAPy ligands located on eight of the twelve octahedron edges, with the remaining edges being occupied with bridging hydroxo ligands, leading to a porous material with two kinds of tunnels. The largest tunnel is hexagonally shaped with a diameter of 31 Å and the smallest tunnel has a triangular shape with a diameter of 8 Å. The overall structure is highly porous with a BET surface area of 2320 m2 g−1. Moreover, NU-1000 is stable in water over a large pH range (1–10).182
Synthetized in 1999 by Chui et al.,183 HKUST-1 (or Cu-BTC) is one of the oldest MOFs. HKUST-1, which can be formulated as Cu3(H2O)3(BTC)2, is composed of dimeric cupric tetracarboxylate units, with the 12 oxygens from the carboxylate groups of the BTC linkers binding four coordination sites for each of the three copper ions of the formula unit. Each metal completes its pseudooctahedral coordination sphere with an axial aqua ligand pointing towards the nanopore. This leads to a paddle-wheeled framework with 18.6 Å diameter hexagonal cages and 13 Å diameter square pore windows.183 This MOF exhibits a relatively low surface area of 690 m2 g−1. It must be noted that Cu-BTC is moderately stable to water and air.177
Lastly, ZIF-8184 belongs to the sub-family of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks wherein individual zinc tetrahedra are connected to each other via the organic ligands to form a sodalite-type network. ZIF-8 has a unique porous structure made of sodalite-type hybrid cages of 12 Å internal diameter communicating through 6-ring windows of 3.4 Å free aperture, allowing a BET surface area of 1630 m2 g−1. ZIF-8 is highly stable to air, water and steam, showing no degradation after a few days under harsh conditions. It can withstand acidic and basic media (in the pH 4–12 range) for several days and oxidative conditions for the same duration.177
Concerning now the catalytic guests, we consider here successively the whole variety of POMs and organometallic and coordination complexes that have been successfully immobilised into one of the MOFs mentioned above. Polyoxometalates are anionic metal oxide clusters built by the connection of MOn (M = WVI/V, MoVI/V, VV/IV, …) polyhedra. They can be divided into two families, isopolyoxometalates and heteropolyoxometalates, with the latter incorporating additional XOn groups (X = PV, SiIV, GeIV, AsV, …). To date, only heteropolyoxometalates have been immobilised into MOFs (see Table 1). More precisely, [XM12O40]n− Keggin and [X2M18O62]n− Dawson species as well as dimeric sandwich-type Keggin POMs have been considered (Fig. 2). The structure of the Keggin POM XM12 can be seen as the assembly of four trimetallic subunits M3O13 around an XO4 tetrahedron.185 By controlled hydrolysis under basic conditions of the saturated species XM12, lacunary (also called vacant) species can be selectively obtained. Monovacant [XM11O39]n−, divacant [XM10O36]n− or trivacant [XM9O34]n− derivatives were thus isolated.186 Knowing how lacunary species are formed, POMs are known to be highly sensitive to pH. The reaction of lacunary Keggin anions with transition metals M′ can lead to the formation of substituted Keggin compounds such as monomeric [SiW9M′3(H2O)3O37]n− (M′ = Co, V) and [XW11M′O39(H2O)]n− (M′ = Ti, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn) compounds presented in Fig. 2. Dimeric sandwich-type POMs [(XW9O34)2M′4(H2O)2]n− (M′ = Co, Ni) can also be isolated by reaction of tri-vacant XW9 Keggin units with 3d ions.187
 Fig. 2  Representations of the POM guests mentioned in this review with their dimensions, formulas and abbreviations. 
Finally, X2M18 Dawson-type POMs, which may be regarded as two XM9 tri-vacant Keggin units connected via six oxygen atoms, have also been incorporated in MOF matrices. Still, looking at Table 1, it is apparent that PW12 accounts for ∼35% of the studies of POMs immobilised into MOFs. This can be explained considering (i) its widely recognized catalytic activity, in particular as an acid catalyst,2 (ii) its stability under most conditions used for its incorporation into MOFs, (iii) its charge and size among the smallest ones within the POM family allowing it to reach high POM loadings, i.e. minimizing charge balance issues upon immobilisation into MOFs, (iv) its commercial availability at low cost and (v) its characteristic IR and 31P NMR signatures highly useful to check its integrity upon immobilisation and before/after the catalytic events.
Concerning organometallic and coordination complexes, the main species successfully immobilised into MOFs are presented in Fig. 3. Metallated phthalocyanine188 and porphyrin189 molecules have been particularly studied, as these species obviously play an important role in (photo)catalysis190–193 including fundamental reactions such as CO2 reduction.194 Bipyridine transition metal complexes (typically M(bpy)3 (M = Ru, Ir) species) have also been selected for their photosensitive195 and catalytic properties.196 Importantly, all these complexes present good chemical stability. Finally, catalytically active salen complexes have also been considered.197,198

2.2 Synthetic strategies
The synthesis of Cat@MOF composites may be performed using various strategies according to the nature of the catalyst, its size compared to the size of the cavity windows and its stability (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Schematic representations of the various synthetic pathways used for the synthesis of pore-functionalized Cat@MOFs. 

2.2.1 Synthetic encapsulation. 
Molecular catalysts may be encapsulated within the cavities of MOFs by a direct synthesis strategy called a ‘ship in a bottle’ method or ‘synthetic encapsulation’ (Fig. 4a) whereby the catalyst is added as a reactant during the MOF synthesis. This method thus requires that the catalyst is both soluble and stable under the conditions of the MOF's synthesis. For example, hydrothermal conditions, with temperatures equal to 180 °C (for 72 h) or 220 °C (for 8 h), are usually described for the synthesis of MIL-101(Cr) composites (Table 1). Note that microwave conditions have also been reported for example for the synthesis of PW12@MIL-101(Cr),54 PW11Zn@NH2-MIL-101(Al)72 and PW12@NH2-MIL-53(Al)76 composites. Zr-based MOF composites are usually synthesised under solvothermal conditions in DMF at 120 °C for 6 to 24 h, while HKUST derivatives are isolated by heating the reactants in water at 180 °C for 6 to 72 h or in mixed H2O/EtOH solvents, at lower temperature to even room temperature (RT). The mechanochemical synthesis is an original method attracting growing interest.199,200 This method consists of grinding the solid precursors in an agate mortar or using a ball-milling grinder. Fast and easy, it does not consume any solvent nor requires any heating. It has been described for PMo10V2@HKUST-1,132 PW12@HKUST-1,129 XM12@ZIF-8 (X = P, M = W, Mo; X = Si, M = W)138 and PMo12−xVx@rho-ZIF (x = 0–3).141 In their first attempts to synthesise POM@HKUST-1,132 Liu et al. showed that the nanocrystals were not well-faceted and improved their protocol by using liquid-assisted grinding.129 They thus used small volumes of MeOH and EtOH (1 to 2 μL per mg of solid reactants) as grinding liquids to increase the crystallinity of the products.
The synthetic encapsulation method is mostly used when the targeted molecular catalyst has dimensions greater than those of the MOF's accessible windows, prohibiting its diffusion and any post-synthetic impregnation approach. In this case, one key advantage of the resulting Cat@MOF composite is that the catalyst, provided that it is stable under the catalytic conditions, cannot leach. However, the pores may be blocked, hindering the diffusion of reactants.


2.2.2 Impregnation. 
When the targeted catalyst is not stable under the conditions required for the MOF's synthesis (acidic medium, high temperature, etc.), an impregnation strategy may be sufficient in order to perform its immobilisation into the MOF's pores or channels. This synthetic method requires however that such a catalyst is small enough to diffuse through the MOF's windows (Fig. 4b). In this milder synthetic method, the catalyst is dissolved in a solvent ensuring its stability, usually water or CH3CN for POM catalysts with protons/alkaline or TBA counter-cations, respectively (Table 1). Regarding organometallic and coordination complexes, various organic solvents (acetone, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, MeOH, toluene, DMF) are used (Table 2). The MOFs’ crystallites are added and the resulting suspension is then stirred for a determined amount of time ranging from 2 hours to 4 days, usually at RT. Note that the stability of the catalyst in the impregnation solution is not sufficient to ensure its integrity upon its immobilisation. As an illustrative example, 31P NMR together with IR spectroscopy (see below) has shown that the hybrid sandwich-type POM [(PW9O34)2Co7(OH)2(H2O)4(O3PC(O)(C3H6NH3)PO3)2]14− (denoted P2W18Co7(Ale)2) evolves into P2W18Co4 when immobilised inside the cavities of the mesoporous MIL-101(Cr) material.38 Two explanations have been proposed to account for the instability of this hybrid POM under the impregnation conditions. The first one is the presence of acidic sites inside the MOF, considering that P2W18Co7(Ale)2 decomposes in aqueous solution at pH lower than ca. 6. Knowing that the stability of the POM depends on the nature of its counter-cations, the second one hypothesises that the loss of its sodium or tetramethylammonium counter-ions upon impregnation in MIL-101(Cr) could affect the stability of P2W18Co7(Ale)2. These observations might explain why there have been no examples of hybrid organic–inorganic POMs immobilised into MOFs so far, with this type of POM being generally less stable than fully inorganic ones.
Lai et al. compared both synthetic methods for preparing PW12@MIL-101(Cr).52 Using impregnation, the PW12 POM was immobilised into the largest cages of MIL-101 exclusively because the size of the smaller cages’ windows prevents the diffusion of the POM into these cavities. By contrast, the direct synthetic encapsulation of PW12 allows its immobilisation into both types of cavities. In the latter case, the leaching of PW12 from the large cages of MIL-101 was performed by soaking the composite in distilled water, with this process being monitored by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy until no more POM is detected in the lixivium.
A few strategies have been reported to prevent leaching of the catalyst in composites synthesised by impregnation methods. For example, Rh and Ru complex functionalized carboxylate groups were co-immobilised into NH2-MIL-101(Cr).153 The authors proposed that hydrogen bond interactions between the carboxylate groups of these pyridine-based complexes and the MOF host allow avoiding their leaching. In the same way, Chen et al. described the post-synthetic modification (PSM) of the linkers of the MOF after the catalyst's encapsulation in order to block the apertures of the MOF cavities and avoid any leaching.169 In the first step, the chiral Co(III)-salen catalyst was first immobilised into the cavities of the Zn-MOF IRMOF-3. In the second step, the free-amino groups of the BDC-NH2 linkers were acylated by reaction with acetic anhydride, with the resulting acylamide groups thus blocking the windows as a fence. ICP analyses indicated that the leaching of the catalyst was important after soaking the material in CHCl3 before PSM treatment, while it was not the case after PSM treatment.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that dissociative linker exchange reactions can afford the encapsulation of molecular guests larger than the aperture size of a MOF host. For example, Li et al. described the encapsulation of the Ru catalyst (tBuPNP)Ru(CO)HCl (tBuPNP = 2,6-bis((di-tert-butyl-phosphino)methyl)pyridine) in the pores of UiO-66 by exposing MOF crystallites to a solution of the catalyst in MeOH for 5 days (Fig. 5).201 The authors thus showed that this aperture-opening process involving the de-coordination/re-coordination of linkers may exist even in a robust MOF and is highly dependent on the nature of the solvent used. Protic solvents such as MeOH are typically adapted to this process. In contrast, aprotic solvents do not favour dissociative linker exchange reactions and are rather required for the catalysis reaction, preventing linker decoordination and leaching.

On a final note, the main advantage of the impregnation method is that it is performed under milder conditions than the synthetic encapsulation method, which are more compatible with the usual fragility of molecular catalysts. Its drawbacks are (i) a limited amount of catalyst's loading for MOFs in which the immobilisation of POMs is based on an ionic exchange (see Section 3.2), (ii) possible leaching (depending on the strength of the host–guest interactions) and (iii) relative spatial heterogeneity (see for example Fig. 8, Section 3.1) when compared to the homogeneity reached with synthetic encapsulation.


2.2.3 The ship in a bottle method. 
This method consists of adding the catalyst's precursors in a suspension of the MOF and in performing its subsequent synthesis within the cavities of the MOF (Fig. 4c). It is particularly used for catalysts with large dimensions and/or low solubilities, which thus prevent their immobilisation using impregnation and synthetic encapsulation methods. The ‘ship in a bottle’ method has been only rarely described for POM@MOF composites (Table 1). Indeed, POMs rarely have solubility problems. Moreover POMs synthetic conditions are often not compatible with the stability of the MOF hosts leading to their degradation. For example, attempts to synthesise the Keggin-type PMo12 POM in situ by adding its precursors, Na2MoO4 and H3PO4, into a suspension of MIL-100(Fe) (with the pH being adjusted to 1.8) have failed due to the degradation of the MOF under the acidic conditions needed for the in situ formation of the POM.87 To our knowledge, as a unique case in the above classification, only one example of a successful one-pot synthesis of both the POM and the MOF using a mixture of their precursors has been reported. Yang et al. thus described the synthesis of the SiMo12@HKUST-1 composite by mixing in water/TMAOH the POM's (Na2MoO4, Na2SiO3) and the MOF's (Cu(NO3)2 and BTC) precursors in precise order and by heating the mixture.122 The successful synthesis of the composite was demonstrated by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies along with 29Si NMR spectroscopy.
By contrast, there have been several successful examples of Complex@MOF composites synthesised by a ‘ship in a bottle’ strategy (Table 2). This is the case of [Ni(bpet)(H2O)2]@Ru-UiO-67 (bpet = 1,2-bis((pyridin-2-ylmethyl)thio)ethane; Ru-UiO-67 = UiO-67 where 5% of the linkers are 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic ligands coordinated to Ru).163 This composite was obtained by first adding bpet to a suspension of the MOF in CH3CN and, after centrifugation and washing, adding Ni(ClO4)2 to a suspension of the bpet/MOF in an acetone/H2O (20/1) mixture (Fig. 6). Similarly, Co dioxime–diimine or Co–TPA complexes have been synthesised in situ within the cages of the visible-light photoactive NH2-MIL-125(Ti) MOF by first adding the flexible ligands and then the Co ions.159,160 After synthesis, the full metalated complex is well entrapped inside the MOF. In the case of the Co-salen@MIL-100(Cr) composite, the order of addition of the complex precursors is different, wherein the Co acetate was added before the H2salen ligand.157 Finally, phthalocyanine metal complexes were also immobilised into MIL-101(Cr)148,149 and MIL-100(Fe)149 by ‘ship in a bottle’ synthetic methods.

The advantages of the ship in a bottle strategy are similar to those of the synthetic encapsulation method. Catalyst leaching is prevented by the large dimensions of the catalyst compared to those of the cavity windows. Catalyst loading must, however, be controlled in order to leave some porosity available and allow the diffusion of reactants and products within the MOF.
Overall, it can be noticed that since the first synthesis of PW12@HKUST-1 in 2003 and PW11@MIL-101(Cr) in 2005, an increasing number of Cat@MOF combinations have been explored in recent years, using the appropriate synthetic technique (synthetic encapsulation, impregnation or ship in a bottle methods), leaving room, however, for a larger diversity of compositions, considering the huge number of molecular catalysts and of MOFs available. The synthetic method used for the immobilisation of the molecular catalysts plays an important role in the crystallinity, the loading, the localisation of the catalytic species in the cavities and finally the catalytic properties, as detailed in the following sections.

3. Characterisation of Cat@MOF composites
3.1 Determination of the composition (ICP, solution NMR, UV-vis, TGA, EDS)
Combining several techniques is usually required to determine the composition of Cat@MOF materials and give access to the Cat loading, having in mind that controlling the loading is of utmost importance in view of catalytic applications. On the one hand, a material loaded with only a small amount of immobilised catalyst may have low performances. On the other hand, an overloading could block the cages or windows and thus limit the accessibility of the reactants to the catalytic species. This has been typically described for PW12@MOF-808X (X = F, A, and P, where the coordinated monocarboxylate ligand is formate, acetate or propioniate, respectively).115 Precise knowledge of the Cat@MOF's chemical composition is also needed for the determination of turn over numbers (TONs) in catalytic studies. The most common and precise techniques are ICP analysis of digested solutions of Cat@MOFs for determining the metal content and C,H,N elemental analysis for the organic content. For example, the Co/In ratio in [Cp2Co]@[R4N]3[In3(BTC)4] (R = Et, nPr, nBu) digested in diluted HNO3 (1/10 v/v) was measured by ICP-OES and allowed quantifying the amount of immobilised complex.172 Note that ICP is also a powerful technique to monitor the uptake of catalysts upon impregnation by analysing the supernatant solutions as reported for PW12@NU-1000, for example.110 This analytic method was also used to follow the leaching of the POM in this material when dispersed in acidic aqueous solutions. Also, solution NMR spectroscopy may be successfully used to determine the relative amounts of immobilised species. For example, 1H NMR spectroscopy allowed establishing the extent of cation exchange via the integration of the relative peaks’ areas of the benzene ring of BTC, of the Cp's protons in [Cp2Co]+ and of tetraethylammonium after the digestion of [Cp2Co]@[TEA]3[In3(BTC)4] in DCl/DMSO-d6 (1/5 v/v).172
Several other techniques may be used to apprehend the chemical composition. UV-vis spectroscopy can monitor the incorporation of the catalyst into the MOF during the impregnation and estimate the amount of Cat immobilised into the MOF. The decrease of the bands of the POM in solution around 250 nm (assigned to the charge transfer from the bridging O-atoms to W-atoms) thus allowed following the immobilisation of PW9,32 PW11,34 SiW11,34 PW11Ti36 and PW11Co36 into MIL-101(Cr) in a qualitative fashion. A detailed UV-vis study was also performed to measure the catalyst's concentration in the supernatant after the impregnation experiment of various Ru catalysts in NH2-MIL-101(Al) and MIL-101(Cr) MOFs152 and of a Rh catalyst and a Ru photosensitiser (PS) in NH2-MIL-101(Al).153 This study allowed determining the loadings in catalysts and identifying the best solvent for their immobilisation. However, the analysis of digested solutions of the Cat@MOF composite itself rather than that of the supernatant solutions should allow a more accurate determination of the catalyst's loading. Indeed, it has been reported that the amounts of immobilised catalyst may be overestimated using the analysis of the supernatant solutions owing to adsorption of Cat species at the surfaces of the MOF crystallites, which should be eliminated with a careful washing.108 For example, the amount of di-μ-oxo dimanganese catalytic complex, [(terpy)Mn(μ-O)2Mn(terpy)]3+ (denoted MnTD, terpy = 2,2′;6′,2′′-terpyridine), immobilised into MIL-101(Cr) was determined by measuring the intensity of the absorption band at 328 nm (arising from the terpy ligand of the complex) of a solution of MnTD@MIL-101(Cr) digested in concentrated sulfuric acid.143
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) may be a useful complement to confirm the chemical composition of a Cat@MOF. A typical example of TGA is presented in Fig. 7 for the PW11Zn@MIL-101(Cr) composite.39 The first weight loss is assigned to the loss of solvent molecules, and the second one to the decomposition of the hybrid framework. The total weight loss of the POM@MOF composite is lower than that of the parent MOF due to the presence of POM guests which decompose into oxides. Hence, the comparison of the weights calculated from the results of elemental analysis with the experimental TGA weight losses allows confirming the molecular formula of the composite and in particular the guest loading. Note that one of the main purposes of TGA is also to study the thermal stability of the composites. In this respect, the temperature of decomposition of a POM@MOF composite is usually very close to that of the MOF host, as exemplified in Fig. 7, which indicates that the insertion of the POM only slightly affects the thermal stability. This seems also the case for the few examples of TGA curves reported for Complex@MOFs. There are, however, some exceptions to this rule. For example, SiW12@HKUST-1 (also named NENU-1), after a thermal treatment at 180 °C under vacuum to remove TMA+ cations and H2O molecules (NENU-1a material), is stable up to 300 °C, while the POM-free MOF is stable up to 240 °C only.130 The authors attributed this difference to physicochemical interactions between the POM and the MOF framework. Similarly, the thermal stability of the composite obtained by immobilisation of the MnTD complex into MIL-101(Cr) was reported to be improved by 40 °C.143

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) are largely used techniques to characterise the morphology and composition of materials, often employed after synthesis, however less often after the catalytic event. SEM images can confirm the degree of the crystallinity of the Cat@MOF composite, while EDS analysis may map the distribution of the chemical elements of interest. In most reported cases, SEM-EDS analysis suggests a uniform distribution of immobilised species. However, one has to be cautious for composites prepared by impregnation since SEM-EDS mapping may not be sufficient to prove a homogeneous distribution. For example, SEM images of P2W18Co4@MOF-545 pointed towards a homogeneous distribution of the Co, W and P elements of the POMs, while HRTEM images revealed higher concentrations of those elements at both extremities of the MOF-545 crystal rods (Fig. 8).108 This observation is consistent with the alignment of the channels of MOF-545 along the c axis, i.e. the longest dimension of the rods, and an accumulation of POMs at the channels’ extremities upon impregnation. Along the same line, Juan-Alcañiz et al. concluded from the analysis of the HRTEM images that stirring the reaction mixture during the POM@MOF synthesis improved dramatically the distribution of PW12 in the MIL-101 matrix and the resulting catalytic performances.41 Also, EDS analysis may be useful to follow anion exchange reactions during impregnation steps. In the two-step procedure leading to the [Co(CO)4]@MIL-101(Cr) composite, it first showed the F− → Cl− exchange (absence of the F Kα peak, presence of the Cl Kα peak) and then the Cl− → [Co(CO)4]− exchange (absence of the Cl Kα peak and presence of the Co Kα and Lα peaks).146

The crystallites of a Cat@MOF composite usually exhibit a morphology similar to that of the parent MOF. Still, there are a few reports of altered morphologies. For example, PW12@UiO-66 crystallites obtained by synthetic encapsulation do not exhibit regular shapes typical of UiO-66 but rather look like agglomerated small particles with irregular inter-grown microcrystalline poly-octahedral morphologies.91 SEM images of (Fe-salen,SiW12)@ZIF-8 showed the uneven surfaces of the nanocrystals, which contrasts with their rather smooth surface in the absence of POM.139 This provides strong evidence in support of the growth of POMs on the surfaces of ZIF-8 crystallites, which was also suggested by the very large amount of POM determined from ICP-OES analysis. Similar SEM images were observed for the yolk/shell ZIF-67/PW12 composite prepared by stirring a suspension of ZIF-67 nanocrystals in a solution of H3PW12 and supported the hypothesis of the presence of the POMs on the surfaces of the MOF crystals.205
3.2 Presence of counter-ions
In most cases, the molecular catalyst is charged, bearing a negative charge in the case of POMs and most often a positive charge for organometallic and coordination complexes (Table 2). The question thus arises of the charge compensation of the catalysts upon their immobilisation into the MOF host. Discussions on the matter are quite rare in articles. For composites prepared by impregnation or in situ synthetic methods, the catalysts may be immobilised with their native counter-ions, thus inducing no modification of the composition of the MOF. This is the case of POM@HKUST-1 composites (also called NENU-n), where the Cu-based MOF framework is neutral and the negative charge of the encapsulated Keggin ions is compensated for by their associated TMA cations and/or protons. The proposed formula for these composites is [Cu12(BTC)8(H2O)12][(TMA)2HnXM12O40] (X = Si, Ge, P, As; M = W, Mo; n = 1, 2)121,122 or [Cu12(BTC)8(H2O)12][H3PW12O40]128 for non-metalated Keggin ions, with protons located on the Keggin ions; [Cu12(BTC)8(H2O)12][(TMA)4PW11CuO39H]119 for the Cu-substituted POM and [Cu12(BTC)8(H2O)12][(TMA)2H5PW10Ti2O40]118 for the Ti-substituted POM. Interestingly, TMA cations may be exchanged with K+ ions in [Cu12(BTC)8(H2O)12][(TMA)2HPW12O40] without loss of crystallinity202 or eliminated by thermal treatment (180 °C under vacuum).130 The cationic Zn(II) porphyrin complex [ZnIINMeTPyP]4+ (NMeTPyP = 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4′-yl)porphyrin) was also immobilised into the Zr porphyrinic MOF PCN-224 together with its iodide counter-ions as shown by EDS analysis.167 In the CoW12@ZIF-8 composite prepared by synthetic encapsulation, the absence of K+ counter-ions (although present in the POM precursor) is evidenced by elemental analysis and the authors proposed that charge compensation of the [CoW12O40]6− POM is ensured by solution protons trapped by the composite.203 The localisation of the protons is, however, not discussed.
By contrast, the immobilisation of anionic catalysts into MIL-101(Cr) by impregnation involves ion exchange reactions. It is important to note that, if the solvent is water, the value of the pH determines the charge of the MOF. The zeta potential can be measured to determine the surface charge characteristics of MOFs in aqueous solution as a function of pH. For example, zeta potential measurements showed that MIL-101(Cr) particles are positively charged for pH values lower than 7.204 This favours the encapsulation of anionic species like POMs. MIL-101(Cr) also possesses negatively charged counter-ions (mostly F− or NO3− counter-ions coordinated to the metal nodes) which can be exchanged with negatively charged Cats. This anion exchange reaction implies a limitation in the catalyst's loading that may be reached upon impregnation. Indeed, the total charge carried by the catalysts cannot exceed the maximum initial negative charge of the counter-ions present in the targeted MOF. For example, with the formula of MIL-101(Cr) synthesised with Cr(NO3)3 as a precursor without HF being [CrIII3(H2O)3O(O2CC6H4CO2)3]NO3, the maximum number of POMs that can be loaded depends on their charge, n, and amounts to 1 POM for n formula units of MIL-101(Cr). Consistently, the immobilisation of Co-POMs, [PW11CoO39(H2O)]5− (PW11Co) or [(PW9O34)2Co4(H2O)2]10− (P2W18Co4), into MIL-101(Cr) by impregnation in a solution containing a large excess of POMs thus led to composites with the following formulae [Cr3(H2O)3O(O2CC6H4CO2)3][PW11O39Co(H2O)]0.2 (PW11Co@MIL-101(Cr)) and [Cr3(H2O)3O(O2CC6H4CO2)3][P2W18O68Co4(H2O)2]0.1 (P2W18Co4@MIL-101(Cr)), which both correspond to the highest possible POM loading on the basis of charge balance.38 Similarly, the immobilisation of the anionic [Co(CO)4]− complex into MIL-101(Cr) is based on an ion-exchange process following two steps. First, the charge-balancing F− anions – directly coordinated to the Cr(III) sites in the as-synthesised MIL-101(Cr) – are exchanged by Cl− anions (by reaction with AlCl3). Second, the labile Cl− ions are exchanged by the negatively charged complex by reaction with Na[Co(CO)4].146
In a similar fashion, the immobilisation of the sandwich-type P2W18Co4 POM by impregnation of MOF-545 in an aqueous solution of the POM is also based on an ionic exchange reaction.108 The MOF-545 framework is positively charged due to the protonation of the Zr6 oxoclusters compensated for by Cl− counter-anions. The latter can be exchanged with POMs, leading to a composite formulated [Zr6O16H18][TCPPH2]2[P2W18Co4]0.2. Likewise, in PW12@NU-1000, the charge compensation of the POM is claimed to result from hydrogens which protonate the hydroxyl groups on the Zr6 nodes. The synthesis of the composite is performed at acidic pH (pH 2.5) to favour this protonation.110
In POM@UiO-67 composites recently synthesised by synthetic encapsulation methods, it has been proposed that the negative charge of the POM guests is compensated for by the positively charged framework. However, this does not result from the protonation of the MOF but rather from linker defects.101 For example, three POM@UiO-67 composites have been synthesised with the proposed formulae: [Zr6O4(OH)4][C14H8O4]5.37[PW12O40]0.42 (PW12@UiO-67), [Zr6O4(OH)4][C14H8O4]5.73[PW11O39Zr]0.18 (PW11Zr@UiO-67) and [Zr6O4(OH)4.30][C14H8O4]5.10[P2W18O62]0.25 (P2W18@UiO-67), where the percentage of missing linkers is equal to 10.5, 4.5 and 15% respectively. The correlation between the POM's charge and its loading appears to be less clear than for MIL-101(Cr) and MOF-545. Indeed, PW12O403− allows a higher loading than P2W18O626−, but PW11O39Zr3− yields a much lower loading than PW12O403− although it has the same charge.
The encapsulation of cationic coordination complexes in anionic MOFs has been rarely reported. The encapsulation of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ was performed in the In-based anionic PCN-99 MOF by impregnation.173 The sulfonated HSO3-MIL-101(Cr) is another example of an anionic MOF host, which can be isolated using a Na+ salt with sodium ions counterbalancing the negative charge of the deprotonated sulfonate groups of the linkers. The encapsulation of cationic Rh154 and Ir155 complexes has thus been described as a cation exchange with some of the sodium ions. The heterogenisations of the same Rh complex in the anionic In-MOF ZJU-28171 and of the cationic Fe and Co complexes in the related [R4N]3[In3(BTC)4] (R = Et, nPr, nBu) MOFs172 were also performed by partial exchange with the MOF's cations, NH2Me2+ and R4N+, respectively (Fig. 9). The exchange of R4N+ cations with the cationic [Cp2Co]+ complexes has been thoroughly studied by the authors, showing that the rate of cation exchange depends on (i) the duration of the impregnation experiment, (ii) the starting [Cp2Co]+/[R4N]+ ratio, and (iii) the size of the organic cation.172 A maximum 82% exchange rate is reached for 72 h impregnation experiments, a [Cp2Co]+/[R4N]+ ratio of 3/1 and for tetraethyl ammonium, the smallest cation.

3.3 Extraction of immobilised catalysts
In some cases, extraction of the immobilised catalyst can be performed, taking advantage of a reversible ion-exchange process. The extraction of the encapsulated species has been studied in POM@MIL-101(Cr) following their synthesis by impregnation methods. The extraction was performed by stirring a suspension of POM@MIL-101(Cr) in a solution of 5 M LiCl. It was followed by studying the supernatant composition using UV-vis and EDS analyses, and 31P NMR spectroscopy for POMs containing P atoms. For example, PW11Co could be quantitatively extracted from MIL-101(Cr), while P2W18Co4 was more tightly bound to the MOF host, allowing only a partial extraction.38 The same experiments performed in 5 M LiNO3 did not afford the extraction of the POM, indicating an affinity of the anions for the MOF in the following order: Cl− > POM > NO3−. PW12,30 PW11Ti36 and PW11Co36 immobilised into MIL-101(Cr) were also extracted using a 1 M solution of Bu4NClO4 in MeCN. Similarly, cationic guests can be reversibly exchanged, such as [Ru(bpy)3]2+ in Ru(bpy)3@PCN-99.173 The release of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ is triggered by adding saturated NaNO3, with the sodium ions replacing the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complexes within the composite. These extraction experiments have been used to have direct proof of the structural integrity of the catalyst upon its immobilisation into the MOF. For example, CuPc phthalocyanines were extracted from MIL-101(Cr) and MIL-100(Fe); UV-vis spectroscopy of the supernatant showed their characteristic absorption bands which demonstrated that the CuPc remained intact after encapsulation into the MOF.149 In contrast to Keggin type POMs and CuPc phthalocyanines, the iron tetrasulfophthalocyanine FePcS could not be extracted from MIL-101(Cr) neither using a solution of NaClO4 in H2O nor a solution of Bu4NClO4 in MeCN.145 This pointed towards strong interactions between the complex and the MOF, such as π–π interactions between the aromatic groups of the MOF's linkers and the complex.
3.4 IR and Raman spectroscopies
In all reported Cat@MOF studies, IR spectra are systematically recorded to check whether the catalyst and MOF structures are preserved. This technique is also routinely used to investigate their stability after the catalytic event. For example, for the PW12 catalyst, characteristic P–O, WO and W–O–W bands are observed around 1000, 980 and between 800 and 900 cm−1, respectively. Significant shifts may be observed when comparing the IR bands of the isolated POM precursor to those of the encapsulated POM. An ∼30 cm−1 red shift was reported for the P–O and WO bands of PW12 immobilised into MOF-808X.115 The P–O vibration was shifted from 1030 to 1048 cm−1 upon immobilisation of P2W18Co4 into MIL-101(Cr) (Fig. 10a).38 A shift of the W–O–W vibration was similarly observed between the POM (802 cm−1) and the PW12@MIL-100(Fe)80 or PW12@MIL-100(Cr)89 composites (825 cm−1). The four characteristic bands of PW12 were also reported to be shifted to higher wavenumbers in PW12@UiO-66.91 Overall, these shifts are interpreted as a result of significant interactions between the POM and its MOF host. IR spectroscopy may also evidence the catalyst's transformation after its immobilisation into the MOF. For instance, the modification of the W–O and P–O vibrations in PW12@MIL-101(Cr) (splitting of the band at 1080 cm−1 and shift of the band at 982 cm−1 to 963 cm−1) prepared by direct synthesis suggested a partial substitution of tungsten by Cr3+ ions.41

(b) Raman spectra of Eu(PW11)2@MIL-101(Cr) before (Eu(PW11)2@MIL-101) and after (Eu(PW11)2@MIL-101-ac) catalysis compared to those of the POM and MOF precursors. Reprinted from ref. 38 with permission from the RSC and ref. 64 (Copyright 2013 Elsevier B.V.) respectively. 
The modification of P2W18Co7(Ale)2's IR bands upon its immobilisation into MIL-101, in particular the disappearance of the vibration at 1117 cm−1 – characteristic of the P–O groups of the bisphosphonate ligand – also confirmed its evolution into P2W18Co4 (Fig. 10a).38 This observation was alleged by 31P NMR studies (see below). Similarly, IR spectroscopy was used to follow the immobilisation of [CpFe(CO)2(THF)]+ cations into the pores of the anionic [Et4N]3[In3(BTC)4] MOF by impregnation in acetone at room temperature for 24 h.172 The presence of three bands instead of two in the ν(CO) region (2123, 2065 and 2016 cm−1) in the IR spectrum of the composite indicated the partial decomposition of the catalyst and the formation of undesired [CpFe(CO)3]+ species. The reaction was further performed by simply soaking (and not agitating) the MOF in a solution of the catalyst at low temperature (5 °C) in order to avoid this decomposition. Moreover, the presence of bands at 1711 and 1221 cm−1 also suggested that acetone replaces coordinated THF in the complex.
Semi-quantitative analysis may also be performed using the IR spectra of Cat@MOFs. For example, the relative intensities of the bands characteristic of the Keggin ion (P–O vibration at 1077 cm−1) and of the MOF's porphyrinic linker (C–C and C–N vibrations at 1180 cm−1) were followed for PW12@Zr6-TCPP-Fe, revealing the maximum amount of POM that could be immobilised into the MOF by synthetic encapsulation experiments.109 It can be noted, however, that in some rare cases the IR bands of the guest cannot be observed, for example in P2W18Co4@MOF-545,108 PMo12@UiO-67,107 and CoW12@ZIF-8,203 likely because of the low loadings involved.
Raman spectroscopy may complement the characterization of Cat@MOF materials, in particular when the catalyst's bands cannot be clearly identified by IR spectroscopy. However, in the case of POM@MOFs, the intensities of these bands are also often quite weak. For example, the Raman spectrum of SiW11@MIL-101(Cr) exhibits a small band at ∼978 cm−1 assigned to the WO stretching mode of SiW11.37 In P2W18Co4@MIL-101(Cr), the WO band of the POM at 982 cm−1 is clearly visible in the Raman spectrum of the composite, although with a rather weak intensity.62 In rare examples, the characteristic Raman bands of the catalyst are intense. This is the case for Eu(PW11)2@MIL-101(Cr)64 and P2W18@MIL-101(Cr).60 In the latter, the WO band is shifted to a lower frequency as a result of POM–MOF interactions (Fig. 10b). Raman spectroscopy was also used to characterise Complex@MOFs. For example, the bands of the iron tetrasulfophthalocyanine, FePcS, are clearly visible in the Raman spectrum of FePcS@MIL-101(Cr) at the same position as in the bulk FePcS precursor and with no additional band, indicating the integrity of the complex upon its immobilisation.145
3.5 N2 adsorption
N2 porosimetry is a largely used technique to characterise MOF-based materials. The significant reduction of the amount of N2 adsorbed in Cat@MOFs compared with that in the pristine MOF is considered as an indication of the successful immobilisation of the catalyst – provided that the MOF remains intact upon the catalyst's incorporation. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas and total pore volumes of Cat@MOF composites are expected to be lower when compared to those of the guest-free MOF, as a result of both the mass increase due to the incorporation of the catalyst and the pore space occupied by the guests. For example, it was shown that the surface area of PW12@MIL-100(Fe) depends on the amount of immobilised POM, PW12@MIL-100(Fe) exhibiting however a high BET surface area (1046 m2 g−1) even for high loadings (35 wt%) when compared to the POM-free MOF (2055 m2 g−1) (Fig. 11).80 The mesoporous and microporous windows are also retained, which ensures that substrates can enter into the pores and come into contact with the POM.

Reprinted with permission from ref. 80. Copyright 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. 
Juan-Alcañiz et al. deduced from the comparison of the N2 isotherms of various samples of PW12@MIL-101(Cr) that for those prepared by synthetic encapsulation the dispersion of the POMs in the MOF matrix was better than that for those obtained by post-synthetic impregnation.41 Indeed, the encapsulated samples with high POM loadings show an adsorptive behaviour similar to the POM-free MOF, i.e. with two steps corresponding to the filling of the two types of cages. This strongly suggests that the filling of the pores by the POMs is quite homogeneous, with no indication of blocking of the cavities. In contrast, for the impregnated samples, BET measurements suggest that only a fraction of the large cavities is occupied (since the POMs are too large to diffuse through the pentagonal windows) and most of these cavities are blocked. Besides, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the (FePctBu4)2N@MIL-101 composite reveal that its total pore volume decreases by only 5%, which corresponds to the weight gain of 5.2 wt% after loading.144 This shows that the bulky (FePctBu4)2N metal phthalocyanines are not incorporated into the mesoporous structure of MIL-101(Cr) as they are too large to enter its hexagonal pore windows but that they are rather adsorbed at the surfaces of the crystallites.
3.6 Cyclic voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetry is more rarely used to characterise Cat@MOF composites as it requires that the catalyst itself exhibits characteristic electrochemical signals. It may give useful information not only on the integrity of the catalyst within the composite but also on the strength of its interactions with the MOF. For example, PW11@MIL-101(Cr) and SiW11@MIL-101(Cr) composites were deposited on a pyrolytic graphite (PG) surface for analyzing their electrochemical behaviour at pH 2.2.35 The authors showed that the encapsulation of the POMs into the hybrid framework does not affect their redox potentials although the quality of the signals was not as good as that of the precursors. Interestingly, they concluded from the linear variation of both cathodic and anodic peak current intensities with the square root of the scan rate that the W redox processes were diffusion-controlled, indicating that PW11 and SiW11 exhibit some degree of mobility when immobilised into the MOF. The same group studied the electrochemical properties of SiW11Fe@MIL-101(Cr) on PG and identified – in addition to a peak assigned to the Cr centres of MIL-101(Cr) – the characteristic peaks of the POM which remain almost unchanged compared to those of the POM precursor (Fig. 12).37 In a similar fashion to PW11 and SiW11, the incorporation of SiW11Fe into MIL-101 leads to a change in its diffusion regime from surface-confined to solution-type behaviour. By contrast, both the anodic and cathodic peak current intensities of PMo10V2@MIL-101(Cr) were directly proportional to the scan rate, which indicated processes confined to the surface and a tighter interaction of the POM with its MOF host.67 Moreover, the electrochemical surface coverage values were four times and ten times higher for SiW11Fe@MIL-101(Cr) and PMo10V2@MIL-101(Cr), respectively, than for the pure POM modified electrodes. This shows that the immobilisation of the POM into the porous structure of MIL-101(Cr) increases the quantity of active POM available at the electrode surface.

Cyclic voltammetry was also performed on PW12@NU-1000,110 PW12@UiO-67,101 PW11Zr@UiO-67101 and P2W18@UiO-67,101 showing that the redox activity of the POM is systematically maintained when immobilised into the MOF. Considering Complex@MOFs, their characterisation by cyclic voltammetry has scarcely been reported. We can cite a study of the electrochemical properties of a Ni(II) complex immobilised into UiO-67 functionalised with Ru ions.163 In this composite, two irreversible reductive waves are attributed to the step-by-step reduction and change of octahedral NiII to tetrahedral Ni0.
3.7 Solid-state NMR
For the POMs which contain P atoms, and in particular for the most frequently studied PW12, 31P{1H} Cross-Polarisation Magic Angle Spinning (CP MAS) NMR has proved to be a valuable tool for studying their stability in the composite materials upon immobilisation, before and after catalysis. For PW11@MIL-101(Cr), the signal at −12.2 ppm thus confirmed the integrity of the POM.17 Similarly, the presence of a single peak around 15.5 ppm (−16.3,42 −15.3,45 −15.4,50 −16.046 ppm) in samples of PW12@MIL-101(Cr) prepared by either direct synthesis or impregnation suggests that the POM remains intact upon incorporation into the MOF. A single broad peak was also observed for PW12@HKUST-1 with however a slightly different chemical shift (−21.4 ppm).124
Nevertheless, a few studies have reported the presence of several 31P NMR peaks after the immobilisation of PW12. For example, Maksimchuk et al. reported three main peaks at −16.4, −14.8 and −11.8 ppm in the spectrum of PW12@MIL-101(Cr).30 As IR spectra did not indicate any noticeable change and thus any degradation of the POM, they proposed that these peaks might correspond to different modes of interaction between the POM and the MOF surface. A similar observation was reported for PW12@NU-1000 where two signals were observed at −15 and −16 ppm and attributed to the different hydration degree of the POM and to the interactions of the POM with Zr6 oxoclusters.112 In another composite, namely PW12@MOF-808A with 42 wt% POM loading, the 31P MAS NMR spectrum exhibited three resonances at −15.1, −16.2, and −17.6 ppm, much broader than that of the pure POM. These three distinct signals were attributed to either the different protonation states of PW12 or to POM distortion emanating from strong interactions with the host framework.115
2D CP MAS NMR 31P–1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) experiments were performed to go further in the investigation of the localisation of three different POMs (PW12, P2W18 and PW11Zr) immobilised into UiO-67.101 The observation of dipolar contacts between the phosphorus atom of the POMs and the protons of the MOF's aromatic linkers as well as Zr–OH hydroxyl groups indicated the close proximity of the POM to the surfaces of the MOF's pores. Furthermore, it was shown that PW12 and P2W18 developed preferred interactions with the linkers, while PW11Zr was closer to the Zr6 oxoclusters. 2D NMR 31P–1H HETCOR experiments provide also valuable information about the interactions between co-immobilised POMs and Cp*Rh complexes in the (PW12,Cp*Rh)@UiO-67 composite.103 While a single 31P NMR peak at −15.1 ppm was observed for PW12@UiO-67,101 two main resonances at −15.2 and −14.4 ppm were distinguished for (PW12,Cp*Rh)@UiO-67, suggesting two different POM environments in the latter composite. HETCOR experiments further showed that the 31P signal at −15.2 ppm correlates with the 1H signal at 8.3 ppm of aromatic protons, while the second signal at −14.4 ppm correlates with that at 1.6 ppm of the Cp* moiety (Fig. 13). DFT calculations were also performed (see below), providing results in full agreement with these experiments, with two possible positions for the POM: one centered in a UiO-67 cavity (with the Cp*Rh complex pointing toward a POM-free pore) and one off-centered position with the Cp*Rh pointing toward the POM.

31P NMR studies have also proved to be very useful for the characterisation of paramagnetic Co-substituted POMs in MIL-101(Cr).38 The spectra were recorded for the solid composites as well as for the solutions obtained after stirring a suspension of the composite in 5 M LiCl. These experiments indicated that the monosubstituted Keggin anion, PW11Co, and the sandwich-type anion, P2W18Co4, can be encapsulated and extracted without degradation, while the hybrid sandwich-type POM, P2W18Co7(Ale)2, evolves into P2W18Co4 once in the cavities of the mesoporous material. Furthermore, the broadness of the 31P NMR signal for P2W18Co4@MIL-101(Cr) under MAS compared to that for PW11Co@MIL-101(Cr) tends to indicate that P2W18Co4 POMs are strongly anchored to the MIL framework, while PW11Co POMs are more mobile. In another study, the broadening of the 31P NMR signal in PW12@NU-1000 heated at 120 °C was attributed to the loss of symmetry around the phosphorus and strong POM–MOF interactions.111
Solid-state NMR has also been used to characterise Complex@MOFs. 13C CP-MAS NMR of CuPhen@MIL-100(Al) exhibits signals assigned to the aromatic carbons and carboxylate groups of the MOF's linkers and Phen ligand.156 The single broad peak observed at ∼15 ppm in the 31P{1H} MAS NMR spectrum of [Ir(cod)(PCy3)(py)]@NaSO3-MIL-101(Cr) is assigned to PCy3 ligands.155 The absence of the peak characteristic of PF6− anions (around −146 ppm) suggests that the cation exchange is indeed complete.
Solution NMR is also useful to investigate the formation of composites. 31P solution NMR was used to study the interactions between Cu2+ and PMo12 ions during the synthetic process of PMo12@HKHUST-1. A shift in the phosphorus resonance was observed from 3.72 ppm for a solution of PMo12 to 3.00 ppm after the addition of Cu2+ and to 3.09 ppm after subsequent addition of BTC. Shifts in the 183W NMR spectra of a solution of PW12 also support the occurrence of strong interactions between the copper ions and the POM during the synthesis of PW12@HKHUST-1, while confirming the integrity of the POM.206
3.8 X-ray diffraction patterns
Single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) has only been possible on a limited number of Cat@MOF materials, mostly for Cu-based MOFs. The single crystal structure of a XM12@HKHUST-1 composite (XM12 = Keggin-type polyoxomolybdate or polyoxotungstate) was first reported in 2003.122 The composite crystallises in the cubic space group Fmm (a ≈ 26 Å), with the POM guests entrapped into half of the cavities of the MOF. This MOF possesses two types of pores (A and B), with diameters of ca. 13 Å and 10 Å. Both display cuboctahedral shapes but only the A-type pores can accommodate the Keggin anions (Fig. 14).121 Water molecules coordinated to the copper ions point towards the centre of the B-type pores, preventing the incorporation of guest species. The Keggin ion is disordered over two positions due to the Oh symmetry of pores A, while the Keggin ion has a tetrahedral symmetry. Since then, several structural studies have been performed on POM@HKUST-1 materials (Table 1). An original synthesis was recently described by Li et al. who used the ability of POMs to oxidise metals to cations: the reaction of Cu foil with aqueous solutions of polyoxomolybdates and BTC linkers led to the nucleation of crystals of POM@HKUST-1 on the metal surface.134 The authors evidenced an effect of the POM's charge on the morphology of the resulting crystals: cubic for SiMo11V5−, PMo9V36− and PMo10V25− or octahedral for PMo11V4−, SiMo124− and PMo123−. This was confirmed later by the synthesis of cubic crystals of PW10Ti27− encapsulated in HKUST-1, while octahedral crystals were obtained with PW123− when using the same synthetic conditions.118 The authors correlated this difference of crystal shape to the difference in electrostatic interactions between Cu2+ ions and the oxygen atoms of the POM during the synthetic process, thus confirming the templating role of the POMs.

rht-MOF-1 is also a Cu-based MOF which crystallises in the cubic Fmm space group (a ≈ 44 Å). It contains four types of cages: cuboid (∼5.9 Å), rhombitruncated cuboctahedral (∼11.6 Å), β-cage like (∼12.1 Å), and α-cage like (∼20.2 Å). The size of the Keggin-type anions is perfectly adapted to the size and the symmetry of the β-cages which are the only occupied cavities of the MOF (Fig. 14b).136,137
Single crystal X-ray diffraction also allowed locating the cationic guest [Cp2Co]+ in the cavities of the anionic [Et4N]3[In3(BTC)4] MOF.172 The impregnation of crystals of MOFs with solutions of the cations leads to crystals with disordered guests. For the crystallographic studies, the composite material was isolated by direct synthetic encapsulation using [Cp2Co]+ as a template. [Cp2Co]3[In3(BTC)4] crystallises in the I3d space group. The disordered cations are localised in the channels and are slightly offset from the −4 axes in the centre of the pores. They interact weakly with the framework via hydrogen bonding between the H atoms of the Cp rings and the O atoms of the MOF framework. The remaining space in the channels is occupied by disordered DMF and H2O solvent molecules.
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) is routinely used to check the crystallinity and especially confirm the phase purity and integrity of the MOF host after the immobilisation of the guests. In almost all cases, modifications in the intensities of the XRD peaks are observed for POM@MOF composites when compared to those of the pristine MOF. However, both the positions and widths of the X-ray reflections have to remain unchanged to indicate that the MOF does not lose its crystallinity upon the immobilisation of the catalyst. A detailed study on the influence of the catalyst's loading on the relative intensity of the PXRD peaks of the composite was reported for CuPhen@MIL-100(Al), isolated by a ship in a bottle mehod.156 The authors showed that the intensity of the Bragg peak at 2θ = 4.0° gradually decreased when the amount of immobilised CuPhen increased (Fig. 15). Such variation was not observed when the sample was prepared by impregnating the MOF with a solution of the CuPhen complex. In the latter case, it was hypothesized that the complex could access the external surfaces of the MIL-100(Al) crystallites only, due to its large size when compared to those of the MIL-100 hexagonal windows.

In some rare cases of Cat@MOFs obtained by synthetic encapsulation, it has been observed that the crystallinity of the MOF depends on the number of encapsulated guests. For example, in PW12@MOF-808X, the crystallinity was improved compared to that of the pristine MOF using POM loadings lower than 32%. The authors hypothesized that the POMs may play the role of a modulator at relatively low loadings, while they may rather induce defects at higher loadings – by inhibiting the coordination between zirconium ions and ligands – thus leading to a decrease in crystallinity.115 Some authors have also reported an increase of the intensity of some peaks. It is the case for the peaks around 5° in the PXRD of P2W18Co4@MIL-101(Cr).62 The occurrence of new diffraction peaks in the PXRD patterns of PW12@MIL-101(Cr)44 and PW12@NH2-MIL-101(Cr)70 has been observed. Although absent in the PXRD of the POM-free MOF, the positions of the new peaks are consistent with the unit cell of MIL-101, and Rietveld refinement was attempted to propose possible locations of the POM in PW12@MIL-101(Cr).44 The authors proposed that the incorporation of the PW12 POM adds electron density to the crystal structure of the MOF, thus creating the observed diffracted intensity at these peak positions.
An interesting study was performed on PW12@NU-1000 composites which had undergone various treatments.111 The PXRD pattern of PW12@NU-1000 is different from that of the parent NU-1000, while that of PW12@NU-1000-120 °C activated at 120 °C is more similar (Fig. 16). Furthermore, the PXRD pattern of PW12@NU-1000-scCO2 activated with supercritical CO2 exhibits peaks at similar d-spacings to PW12@NU-1000-120 °C but with very different intensities. Upon heating, there is an irreversible evolution of the PXRD pattern of PW12@NU-1000-scCO2 to that of PW12@NU-1000-120 °C. The authors proposed that, assuming no preferred orientation of composite crystallites and retention of the MOF structure, the variations in peak intensities indicate major differences in the location of the guest. These discrepancies, corroborated by difference envelope density analyses (see Section 3.9), were thus attributed to the POM residing either in the mesoporous channels of NU-1000 (before treatment at 120 °C) or in the microporous ones (after treatment at 120 °C). These hypotheses were further confirmed with a study on PW12@NU-1000-NDC and PW12@NU-1008, where NU-1000-NDC and NU-1008 have similar structures to NU-1000.114 PXRD also allowed showing the transformation of NH2-MIL-101(Al) to NH2-MIL-53(Al) during the immobilisation of a hemin catalyst, a consequence of the instability of NH2-MIL-101(Al) in DMF.151

These various studies highlight the fact that the localisation of the POMs within the cavities of MOFs may induce great changes in the PXRD patterns of the composites, yet with rare reports of Rietveld refinement. Still the careful analysis of PXRD patterns allows making hypotheses on the structure of the POM@MOF. The Pair Distribution Function (PDF) method and difference envelope density (DED) analysis might be efficient alternatives to go further in their structural characterization, as detailed below.
3.9 Difference envelope density (DED) and pair distribution function (PDF)
Characterising the structures of a wide variety of Cat@MOF materials is often challenging using conventional diffraction techniques, either due to the lack of single crystals or to the difficulty in performing Rietveld structural refinement of powder data. Although the porous MOF host may have an already known crystal structure that is usually retained upon the immobilisation of the hosted molecular catalysts, the resulting Cat@MOF material often lacks long-range order as a result of the disordered placement of the guest. In addition, low Cat loadings resulting from the synthetic steps may further decrease their detectability, prohibiting the use of conventional structure solution methods in order to identify their position within the MOF's pores precisely. In such cases, difference envelope density (DED) analysis was proposed as an efficient alternative in order to locate disordered guest species in porous materials.207 The generated envelope separates regions of low and high electron density as extracted from low-order reflections in the X-ray powder diffraction data. In a guest-functionalised MOF, DED may be obtained by subtracting the envelope of the parent MOF from that of the functionalised material,208 thus providing the electron density of the guest within the host. Using synchrotron X-ray data, Chapman and co-workers used such DED analysis in order to characterise the PW12@NU-1000-120 catalyst activated at 120 °C under vacuum.110 Exploiting the small differences between the NU-1000 and PW12@NU-1000 PXRD patterns, DED allowed locating the POM guest in the small triangular channels of NU-1000 (Fig. 17a). As mentioned above, the same authors further reported a different location of the POM in the PW12@NU-1000-scCO2 composite prepared under milder conditions (i.e. supercritical CO2 drying) wherein the POM was rather located in the larger c-pores of NU-1000, in line with the improved catalytic activities of this composite (Fig. 17b).111 This structural difference between the two composites was interpreted in terms of the migration of the POM with temperature to more thermodynamically favoured positions within the smaller triangular channels of NU-1000. This couple of studies shows the efficacy of DED analysis to detect variants of similar composites and analyse the impact of synthetic conditions.

Another powerful experimental tool not restricted to crystalline materials is the Pair Distribution Function (PDF) method. The PDF signal emanates from both Bragg diffraction and diffuse scattering, providing information about long-range atomic order and short- to middle-range structural features, respectively. The PDF signal is defined in real space and reflects the probability of finding a pair of atoms at a distance r in the structure. It may thus be described as a one-dimensional function that exhibits peaks at r-values corresponding to characteristic atomic distances within the sample.209 Chapman and co-workers proposed an elegant approach, namely the differential PDF (d-PDF) method,210 whereby the local structure of the guest, the host–guest interactions and the modification of the host structure are retrieved through the subtraction of the reference PDF of the guest-free host from that of the guest loaded host. PDF and d-PDF have been successfully used for characterising non-ideal MOFs,211 MOF materials functionalised with metal oxo-clusters212,213 or the adsorption of small molecules.214–216
Using a laboratory X-ray source, the use of PDF and d-PDF methods has been recently extended to the characterisation of POM@MOF composites in conjunction with DFT methods (see Section 4).103,109 The PDF and d-PDF analyses provided an unequivocal signature of the immobilised PW12 polyoxometalate in the PW12@UiO-67 and (PW12,Cp*Rh)@UiO-67 composites (Fig. 18a and b).103 The d-PDF directly reflected the local structure of the POM through the exhaustive inventory of interatomic distances within the PW12 moiety from which structural refinement of the POM was performed (Fig. 18c). The relatively good quality of the refinement (Rw ≈ 28.2%) and the corresponding structural model indicated that the original structure of the POM was indeed preserved upon its immobilisation into UiO-67. Importantly, the similarity between both experimental d-PDF signals associated with the PW12 immobilised into (PW12,Cp*Rh)@UiO-67 before and after catalysis provided direct proof of the integrity of the POM upon photocatalysis (Fig. 18d). A similar approach was reported for characterising composites isolated by in situ immobilisation of PW12 in a porphyrinic MOF. PDF analysis allowed determining that the MOF phase synthesised by heating preformed Zr6 oxoclusters and Fe-metallated TCPP porphyrins at 25 °C was a mixture of MOF-525 and PCN-224 phases and that the POM was intact upon its immobilisation.109

3.10 XPS, XANES, EXAFS, SAXS spectroscopies
XPS, XANES, EXAFS and SAXS spectroscopies are techniques more rarely encountered as characterisation methods of Cat@MOFs as they cannot be routinely performed in laboratories. However, they are very powerful. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) can determine metal oxidation states as well as characterize metal–O(N, C, S,…) bonds and study POM–MOF interactions. For example, the XPS spectra of N 1s and Mo 3d were recorded for PMo12@UiO-67-bpy and CoPMo12@UiO-67-bpy107 and compared with the POM-free UiO-67-bpy sample and the POM precursor. The binding energies of N 1s in the hybrid composite shift positively, while the binding energies of Mo 3d shift negatively. According to the authors, such shifts suggest some interaction between the POMs and the bipyridine ligands of the UiO-67-bpy host. XPS was also performed to characterise the P2W18Co4@MIL-101(Cr) composite.63 The shift observed for the Co 2p3/2 peak between the P2W18Co4 precursor (781.1 eV) and the POM immobilised into the MOF (781.6 eV) is attributed to the electrostatic POM–MOF interactions.
XPS was also carried out to characterise a Ni complex immobilised into a functionalised UiO-67 MOF.163 The XPS spectrum displays the signature peaks of C, O, N, S, Ru and Ni. Furthermore, high resolution XPS S 2p and Ni 2p spectra show the peaks corresponding to Ni–S bonds and confirm the integrity of the complex within the composite. Similarly, XPS Fe 2p spectra of iron phthalocyanines immobilised into MIL-101(Cr) are close to those of the bulk FePcS precursors. The surface [Fe]/[Cr] atomic ratio is also found to be close to the bulk value determined by ICP-OES, which suggests that FePcS may be located on both the external and internal surfaces of MOF particles.145
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is used to probe the local atomic structure around a targeted atom, as well as its chemical state (oxidation and often spin state). For example, the Co-K edge XANES spectra of P2W18Co4@MIL-101(Cr)63 and P2W18Co4@MOF-545108 composites were investigated in order to probe the integrity of the POM in the MOF. The comparison with selected standards such as Co3O4, Co(OH)2 and Co(NO3)2 confirmed that the oxidation state of the Co ions was 2+. EXAFS spectra recorded on PW12@NU-1000 were in agreement with the presence of the WOx polyhedra constitutive of PW12. This contrasted with the W-SIM material, obtained by impregnation of NU-1000 with a solution of bis(tert-butylimido)bis(dimethylamino)tungsten(VI), which contained isolated W atoms only.112 Identical Ru K-edge XANES and FT-EXAFS spectra were obtained for the Ru(bpy)3@NH2-MIL-125(Ti) composite and the [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 precursor, showing the integrity of the Ru complex after its immobilisation into the MOF.161 Time-resolved XAS experiments allow going a step further. By determining the chemical state of the active species during the catalytic reaction, these experiments provide information about mechanistic aspects. Such studies have been very rarely described for Cat@MOF composites. Illustratively, Co K-edge XANES spectra were recorded for a freshly suspended cobaloxime@NH2-MIL-125(Ti) composite sample during its in situ incubation in an acetonitrile/triethylamine/water (5:1:0.1) mixture and under illumination.217 The initial spectrum indicated the presence of Co(II) cations and clearly differed from those obtained for the pristine Co(III)-cobaloxime complex. The EXAFS data showed that the Co(II) species exhibited an octahedral first coordination sphere formed by O and/or N atoms at ∼2 Å. Furthermore, a Co–Co atomic distance was detected at 3.4 Å, suggesting the presence of Co dimers. The spectrum evolved during the incubation. Based on these observations, a structural model of the Co centres was proposed where the Co-dimers partially dissociated and got closer to the Ti-oxoclusters. Finally, operando XANES experiments showed a partial reduction of Co centres.
Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is another analytical technique which is only very rarely applied. SAXS measurements of a Rh(I) complex immobilised into MIL-101(Cr) and of the parent MOF were performed.218 The scattering curves are nearly straight lines in the q-range between 0.1 and 1. The slope of the logI vs. logq plot is between 3.8 and 4 for both samples. This value is in agreement with the smooth surfaces of the MOF particles. The presence of nanoparticles at the surfaces of the crystallites would add an additional intensity and give rise to a curved-shape of the plot. Such features were not observed, confirming a high dispersion of the complex within the mesopores of the MOF.
Overall, the chemical and structural characterisation studies of Cat@MOF composites are essential not only to investigate the as-synthesised materials including the effective immobilisation of the hosted molecular complex but also to evaluate their stability and recyclability upon the catalytic events and the integrity of the hosted molecular species. In this respect, PDF analysis is deemed to play an increasing role by bringing atomic-scale evidence of the structural integrity of the composite along its catalytic lifetime, although such techniques usually require much larger amounts of powdered samples than those used for performing catalytic tests. Notably, a yet scarcely explored sub-field in Cat@MOFs remains that of defects – particularly those formed upon the catalyst's immobilisation – which would deserve more dedicated attention in the future due to their often critical role in catalysis.
4. Computational chemistry of Cat@MOFs
As mentioned above, the catalytic properties of Cat@MOF solids rely both on the integrity of their multiple components – the MOF host, the guest catalyst or other molecular species co-immobilised into the pores – and on subtle interactions between the immobilised species and the hybrid framework. The understanding of structure–catalytic property relationships heavily depends on atomic-level structural knowledge. However, the availability of Cat@MOF composite single crystals remains rather rare and is limited to restricted sub-families of compounds (see Section 3.8). Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction patterns – based on the analysis of Bragg peaks arising from symmetry in polycrystalline solids – may be used to locate guest species while retrieving the host's crystal structure. However, such a technique may not be suitable for locating large, extra-framework complexes even by using high resolution synchrotron data, when the immobilised guests exhibit a strong positional disorder in the porous host often combined with low loadings. Even though many studies on Cat@MOFs have been published, there has rarely been any report on crystal structure determinations from powders, besides those proposed from difference electron density maps110,219 (see Section 3.9). In this context, computational chemistry approaches of pore-functionalised Cat@MOFs have key roles to play in order to:
(i) Elucidate the atomic-level positioning of the guest molecular complexes by probing the potential energy surface of the catalyst–MOF interface through statistical methods, and propose reliable possible structures of the Cat@MOF composite. Interestingly, this computational step may take into account the heterogenisation method used in the synthesis of the Cat@MOF composite (impregnation vs one-pot synthesis, for instance) by allowing/prohibiting access to a subset of pores that are accessible/inaccessible to the guest moieties. This first step is an essential one for providing the necessary initial atomic positions for any further computational investigations.
(ii) Scrutinise the host–guest interactions and identify underlying structure–function relationships relevant to the catalytic reaction of interest.
(iii) Perform further electronic structure calculations such as band structures or mechanistic studies to investigate reaction pathways. While some Cat@MOF materials maintain their catalytic performances within the same range as their homogeneous counterparts with a stabilising role of the MOF, others exhibit significantly enhanced catalytic activities upon the heterogenisation inside the MOF, revealing an interesting synergy between the guest and its bearing structure. Such materials call for computations capable of comparing catalytic pathways and understanding the role of the heterogenisation step in the reactivity of Cat@MOF composites.
(iv) Provide rational grounds to design novel materials with enhanced catalytic performances.
Bearing in mind the complexity of such large-scale MOF-based composites, one of the common challenges to (i), (ii) and (iii) is the affordability and reliability of DFT-level calculations. Cluster models cropped from geometry-optimised periodic models of Cat@MOFs may be necessary or considered as a preferred alternative in terms of computational cost.
The computational chemistry of heterogeneous catalysis in MOFs is an extremely active area. Recent reviews dedicated to single-site catalysis in MOFs have been reported that cover a whole range of situations, wherein the MOF's metal nodes are used as anchoring sites of single-site catalysts, its organic linkers are decorated with covalently anchored functional groups or its pores are used for hosting embedded metal nanoparticles.220–223 By contrast, turning to non-covalently immobilised molecular complexes within MOFs’ pores, reports of computational chemistry approaches remain rather scarce, especially using DFT methods, probably limited by the often very large size and disordered nature of the systems to compute. We highlight here a small number of recent studies, pointing out the methodology used for locating the guest and the subsequent computations in terms of reactivity or electronic structures.
The single-step synthesis of an enantioselective catalyst for the epoxidation of dihydronaphthalene was reported in 2013 by Bogaerts et al. by entrapping a chiral Mn(II)salen into a MIL-101 host, leading to Mn-Salen@MIL-101(Al).150 Catalysis experiments showed minor differences in selectivity between the homogeneous (82% conversion, 70%ee) and heterogeneous conditions (69% conversion, 70%ee). In order to gain more insights into this immobilised catalytic system, ab initio calculations were performed using first a simplified model of the non-encapsulated (S,S)-variant of the Salen catalytic complex, i.e. neglecting its axial ligand. Optimisations were done with the OPBE functional and 6-31+G(d) basis set for H, C, O, and N atoms and 6-311++G(2df,2p) basis set for Cl and Mn atoms implemented in the Gaussian09 suite of programs. The mechanistic study revealed that the transition state leading to the (1R,2S)-epoxydihydronaphthalene enantiomer is disadvantaged when compared to the one leading to the (1S,2R) enantiomer due to the local steric hindrance of the latter (see Section 5.1.1). A free energy difference of 10 kJ mol−1 between the two transition states is calculated. Assessing the impact of the surrounding MOF, further single-point calculations were performed within a single small cage (29 Å diameter) cropped from MIL-101's periodic structure and terminated with formate linkers, with the two transition states successively positioned manually in the centre of the MIL-101 large cage in similar orientations. A free energy difference similar to that under homogeneous conditions between the two transition states was found (12 kJ mol−1), thus confirming the experimental findings.
Sharma et al. reported the immobilisation of an ionic porphyrinic complex, [ZnIINMeTPyP]4+[I−]4 (NMeTPyP = 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4′-yl)porphyrin) within the porous porphyrinic PCN-224. The resulting Complex@MOF is an excellent, recyclable catalyst for the cycloaddition of CO2.167 DFT calculations were used in this case to show the appropriate size match between the 1D channels of PCN-224 and the guest along with the stabilisation of the latter via π–π interactions with the PCN-224's porphyrin linker. The [ZnIINMeTPyP]4+[I]4 porphyrin complex was manually placed inside the PCN-224 void and further geometry optimised with the DMol software using the GGA-PBE functional with a Double Numeric Polarisation (DNP) basis set and Grimme's DFT-dispersion corrected scheme to account for short-range interactions. No further electronic structure or mechanistic studies were performed to elucidate the enhanced catalytic activity of the porphyrin@PCN-224 composite toward the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides when compared to the homogeneous conditions.
In another context, the non-covalent immobilisation of C60 and quantum dots into the pores of MOFs has recently received attention to address the electrically insulating character of MOFs, which emanates from their poorly conducting organic linkers combined with poor overlap between organic ligands and metal orbitals. The encapsulation of C60 is thus envisioned as a strategy for promoting charge transfer from the electron-donating linkers to the C60 acceptor, rendering the MOF electrically conductive.224 Although this is not a catalytic coordination complex, we present here some recent studies on C60@MOF which provide beautiful examples of the development of computational approaches over the years on rather complex host–guest composites. The concept of enhanced conductivity in C60@MOF composites was initially proposed by Hamel et al. in 2005 on theoretical grounds, with a pioneering DFT study of the encapsulation of C60 in the archetypal hybrid zinc-based MOF-5.225 Periodic DFT calculations were performed within the generalised gradient approximation (GGA)226 using the SIESTA program package227,228 with a 2 × 2 × 2 k-point sampling of the Brillouin zone. The calculated band structure of the composite exhibits a high density of conduction states, considerably higher than the one of any of the known C60 crystals at the time, with new fullerene-induced bands in the band gap of the host structure, pointing towards the promising electronic properties of such composites. In 2015, we note that Feng et al. compared the relative energies of two selected orientations of a fullerene immobilised into MOF-177, namely Y2@C79N⊂MOF-177, at the DFT-level with the DMol3 package (GGA-PBE functional), however without systematically exploring the energy landscape of the C60–MOF interface or providing electronic structure insights.229
Interestingly, Liu et al. recently provided experimental evidence that the photoconductivity of porphyrinic MOFs may be boosted by C60 embedded in the nanopores of highly oriented SURMOF films of the C60@Zn(TPP) (TPP = 5,15-bis-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-10,20-bis-(4-carboxyphenyl)) porphyrinato zinc(II) compound.230 In order to understand the mechanism of charge transport of C60@Zn(TPP), the authors performed first-principles DFT calculations using both cluster and periodic models. By placing the C60 manually within the pores, the C60@Zn(TPP)-MOF structure was optimised at the periodic level with the PBE exchange–correlation GGA functional with Grimme's D2 dispersion correction,231 as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).232 Individual element calculations (porphyrins, C60 and their complex) were performed using the B3LYP hybrid functional with the def2-SV(P) basis set and Grimme's D3 dispersion correction233 as implemented in the Turbomole package.234 The analysis of electronic coupling pointed towards hole transport within the porphyrin linkers. Electrons flowed through the fullerenes, assisted by the donor–acceptor interactions in the Zn(TPP)–C60 pairs. This allowed for a rapid charge separation and limited charge recombination. Fig. 19A illustrates the HOMO and LUMO of the Zn(TPP)–C60 complex and the charge separation visible from the electron density difference after the porphyrin photoexcitation.

More recently, Pratik et al. reported an in-depth computational study of C60 guests immobilised into two porphyrinic MOFs (DA-MOF and F-MOF) including their chemical variations at the meso-position of the porphyrin (H-, F-, NH2-).235 Geometry optimisation calculations of a series of C60@MOFs, whereby a handful of polymorphs were considered by varying the position of C60, were performed employing the semilocal PBEsol236 functional within the generalised gradient approximation, while single point calculations for band energies and densities of states used the HSE06 hybrid functional.237 Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were performed on cluster models of C60@MOFs. Overall, these solid-state calculations indeed point towards facilitated electronic transport of C60 encapsulated into porphyrinic MOFs. The HOCO (Highest Occupied Crystal Orbital) mainly comprises p-orbitals of the linkers and the LUCO (Lowest Unoccupied Crystal Orbital) predominantly comprises p-orbitals of C60 (Fig. 19B), indicating that photoelectrons and holes generated on the linker should readily transfer to C60 in the interfacial region.
In a similar context of conductivity enhancement of MOFs, Choudhuri et al. investigated in 2018 the electronic transitions and the possibility of charge separation on CdS nanoclusters immobilised into NU-1000 combining periodic calculations, ab initio molecular dynamics calculations and TD-DFT calculations on molecular models derived from the periodic ones.238 Various candidate positions of the CdS cluster were installed within the large and small pores of NU-1000, and were geometry optimised, whereby the most favorable site was identified as a ‘node’ site within the large hexagonal pore (Fig. 20a). The direct charge transfer from the HOCO controlled by the organic linker to the LUCO of the Cd6S6 encapsulated cluster led to charge separation that may increase the life-time of the excitation, thus resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performances (Fig. 20b). Overall, band edge alignments confirm that the CdS@NU-1000 composite may perform photocatalytic water splitting under visible light which may be further modulated using functionalised pyrene-linkers (Fig. 20c).

In the context of Cat@MOFs for photocatalysis, Mellot-Draznieks and co-workers used a two-step strategy to investigate the structures of Cat@MOF systems.103,108,109,153 In the first step, the {Cat, MOF} potential energy surface is probed using forcefield-based Monte Carlo simulated annealing (SA) calculations in order to establish a preliminary selection of the most likely positions and orientations of the molecular complex within the pores or channels. In this statistical search, the molecular complex is treated as a rigid body allowed to visit the targeted void space of the MOF, while the framework is treated as a fixed-atom host. Non-covalent interactions between the guest (POM, molecular complex, photosensitiser,…) and its bearing matrix are described using generic forcefields in which short-range interactions (as Lennard–Jones potentials, for instance) and electrostatic interactions (through partial charges on the host and guests using the charge equilibration method)239 are explicitly included.
Using the latter selection, subsequent DFT-D3 level periodic or cluster calculations are performed to relax atomic positions and obtain accurate geometry-optimised host–guest systems, using the GGA–PBE functional as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). This second step allows ranking in energy the latter selection of candidate positions, identifying the most favored ones while scrutinising the host–guest interactions involved. Further electronic structure calculations may be performed on cluster-like models cropped from the DFT-level optimised periodic ones.
In 2018, Wang et al. reported the immobilisation of a full photosystem in a MOF for selective CO2 reduction into formate, wherein the molecular catalyst [Cp*Rh(4,4′-bpydc)]2+ (4,4′-bpydc = 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid) and photosensitiser [Ru(bpy)2(4,4′-bpydc)]2+ are co-immobilised into the highly porous NH2-MIL-101(Al) MOF upon post-synthetic impregnation.153 The choice of carboxylate guests was initially guided by the intuition that carboxylic acid groups may favor additional host–guest interactions such as hydrogen bonds between the guests and the MOF's chemical groups. The combined SA-DFT calculations revealed two favored positions for the Rh-catalyst, wherein the most favorable one is stabilised through a series of hydrogen-bonds between the carboxylic group of the Rh-complex and one amino group of the organic linker and one terminal water molecule of the inorganic Al-subunits. An additional host–guest π–π interaction provides further stabilisation between the Cp* moiety of the Rh complex and the phenyl ring of an adjacent MOF's aminated linker. These calculations corroborate the experimental observations wherein the use of carboxylate-functionalised complexes allows enhanced host–guest interactions and prevents them from further leaching during photocatalysis.
The further use of this SA-DFT methodology for probing the structure of a POM@MOF photocatalytic system was first published in 2018 by Paille et al.108 on the immobilisation of the [(PW9O34)2Co4(H2O)2]10− (P2W18Co4) sandwich POM within the porphyrinic MOF-545's hexagonal channels for water photo-oxidation purposes. The SA-DFT calculations suggest that the POM is hosted between two Zr6-clusters while surrounded by two adjacent porphyrins, in a position consistent with its oxidation by the oxidised porphyrinic linkers required upon photocatalysis. DFT calculations indicate that a particularly dense network of host–guest hydrogen bonds stabilises the P2W18Co4 POM, whereby the Co-OH2 catalytic site is exposed to a hydrophilic environment at the POM–MOF interface which may provide ideal shuttling of protons and water molecules from the solvent (Fig. 21A).

Similar computational approaches were used to investigate the positioning of the PW12 Keggin-POM into UiO-67103 and MOF-525109 in conjunction with pair distribution function (PDF) analysis (see Section 3.9). Following earlier work on Cp*Rh@UiO-67 for CO2 reduction under visible light illumination,240 Benseghir et al. reported in 2020 the synergetic combination of the Cp*Rh(bpydc)Cl2 catalytic linker with an immobilised PW12 Keggin-POM encapsulated inside UiO-67's pores. Besides the high computed affinity of the POM for the Rh-free UiO-67 as a result of its confinement in the rather small size pores of UiO-67, the DFT calculations identified two possible environments for the POM in the (PW12, Cp*Rh)@UiO-67 composite. They were distinguished whereby the Cp*Rh catalytic moiety is oriented either toward an empty, i.e. POM-free, neighboring cage (Fig. 21Bb, position ‘out’) or toward the same cage as the PW12 guest (Fig. 21Bc, position ‘in’), with the latter being favored over the former. The presence of the Rh-catalyst displaces the POM off the centre of the cage when the Cp* moiety points toward the PW12 POM, which results in a new POM environment characterised by a 31P NMR signal at −14.4 ppm as revealed by the 2D 31P–1H correlation experiment (see Section 3.7). The 31P NMR signal at −15.2 ppm is assigned to the POM centred in the cage with no close interaction with the Cp* of the Rh-complex.
Seeking to elucidate the role of the POM in the boosted photocatalytic performances of the (PW12,Cp*Rh)@UiO-67 composite in CO2 reduction, further calculations of the relative positioning of the POM's HOMO–LUMO bands and the Rh-catalyst's were performed. When compared with the POM-free conditions, DFT calculations reveal that the electronic structure of the Rh-catalyst is hardly affected by the POM. Furthermore, the LUMO of the POM is placed, in the absolute scale, at more negative energies than the LUMO of the Rh-complex, thus disfavoring its role as an electron relay. Building on these findings and on the absence of significant catalytic activity of the Rh-free PW12@UiO-67 solid, Meng and co-workers rather suggested that the POM may assist the CO2 reduction as a proton relay, in line with the known enhanced proton conductivities in PW12@MOF/COF materials.241
Duguet et al. used a similar combined DFT-PDF methodology to probe the structure of PW12 encapsulated in a MOF-525(Fe) porphyrinic matrix.109 SA-DFT simulations reveal a non-centred positioning of the POM within the MOF's cubic cage showing that PW12 is cornered close to a Zr-oxocluster inorganic node. In addition, a particularly high host–guest interaction energy of 422 kJ mol−1 is calculated. They corroborate the 2D 31P–1H correlation CP MAS NMR experiment pointing towards the spatial proximity of the POM with the inorganic subnetwork. Interestingly, these DFT calculations corroborate the experimental finding wherein a structure-directing role of the PW12 polyoxometalate in porphyrinic MOF synthesis is evidenced, with the promotion of the kinetic MOF-525 phase with respect to the thermodynamic MOF-545 phase.
Recently Lan and co-workers used a similar strategy to investigate a series of composites whereby various metallocenes are immobilised into the MOF-545(Co) porphyrinic host, for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2.166 Monte Carlo simulations in the (N,V,T) ensemble were performed using the UFF generic forcefield in order to introduce and locate up to 6 CoCp2 complexes per unit-cell. The calculations show that the CoCp2 species are localised in the triangular channels rather than in the hexagonal ones, near the porphyrin linkers and the Zr-oxoclusters. Finite cluster DFT calculations were also performed on porphyrin–metallocene pairs to evaluate the free energy profile of CO2 reduction to CO, pointing toward the particularly favored adsorption energy of CO2 on the (Co-TCPP/CoCp2) pair when compared to other MCp2 (M = Fe, Ni) as a result of a C–Co bond between a carbon atom of the CoCp2 moiety and the Co center of the porphyrin. The electrodonating role of the metallocene is also mentioned.
Overall, computational chemistry approaches have been shown to be particularly efficient in bringing structural insights into the locations of molecular guests within the MOF host – those being often inaccessible using conventional diffraction techniques – and complement the analysis of PDF experimental data, but this at a relatively low computational cost. Still, electronic structures and catalytic pathways remain computationally highly demanding for such host@guest composites, although they are deemed to play an increasing role in the future in order to participate in the design of Cat@MOFs with targeted performances (light capture, conductivity, catalytic selectivity,…).
5. Catalytic applications of Cat@MOF composites
Owing to their exceptional acidic and redox properties combined with their high thermal stability, the catalytic properties of POMs have been tremendously studied in the last few decades. Besides fundamental studies, these molecular oxides have found application in several industrial processes, including hydration of alkenes to alcohols,242 esterification of acetic acid to ethyl acetate243 and oxidation reactions such as the transformation of ethylene to acetic acid.244 This highlights that acid catalysis and oxidative catalysis are two major areas in which these materials can excel. But noticeably, electro- and photocatalysis processes involving POMs have been particularly developed in the last few years. Among polyoxometalates, Keggin-type species – and especially the seminal H3PW12O40 saturated highly acidic and robust POM – have been by far the most studied molecular oxide family. This is not only due to their high stability, but also to their high tunability, with vacant Keggin species being able to incorporate nearly all the metallic elements of the periodic table. For example, it has been demonstrated that cobalt-incorporating Keggin-type POMs are particularly efficient for water oxidation – while saturated Keggin species are non-active. But we will see that other POMs, i.e. Ishii–Venturello complexes and several Dawson derivatives, have also been considered with success. MOFs also exhibit a tremendous variety of (photo)(electro)catalytic properties.3,245,246 However, we will focus in the following on Cat@MOF systems for which the catalytic properties are driven by the encapsulated molecules. In other words, in the composites mentioned below, the MOF is considered as a platform for supporting the incorporated catalytic molecular unit. However, it can not only act as a support for heterogenisation but may also play many roles ranging from serving as a photocatalyst to Lewis acid, to stabilizing the catalyst or improving its selectivity. Nonetheless, we will point out several cases in which both the components are the sites of catalytic events. Finally, we have also included in this review MOF materials incorporating non-POM molecular catalysts (coordination complexes incorporating in particular phthalocyanine, porphyrin or bpy ligands, and organometallic complexes). Interestingly, such Cat@MOF composites have been more scarcely reported, in part due to the generally lower stability of these metal-based complexes compared to POMs. Nevertheless, such materials may exhibit catalytic properties not exhibited so far by POM@MOF compounds, such as the ability to reduce carbon dioxide under photocatalytic conditions, and can therefore be seen as complementary families. We will thus give in this section an overview of the catalytic properties of the POM@MOF and Complex@MOF systems reported in Tables 1 and 2, covering the various catalytic, photo- and electrocatalytic reactions. In these two tables, the natures of the catalytic reactions and of the reactants as well as the catalytic conditions (solvent, temperature) are indicated. The catalytic properties of Cat@MOFs are usually studied under liquid phase conditions, with Cat@MOF particles being in suspension in the solution, but some studies report gas phase reactions (see Tables 1 and 2). Such gas phase reactions represent eco-friendly conditions by avoiding the use of organic solvents and allow easier product separation. Concerning electrocatalytic reactions, the preparation of Cat@MOF-modified electrodes involves two main methods. The first one consists of mixing the Cat@MOF composite with acetylene black carbon and Nafion before coating this mixture ink on a glassy carbon electrode.139,203 or on a carbon paper electrode.166 In the second method, a small amount of the Cat@MOF composite is directly transferred to a pyrolytic graphite working electrode by rubbing the deposited powder on its surface.37,101
5.1. Oxidation and reduction reactions

5.1.1 Oxidation of alkenes. 
Epoxides are intermediates that can participate in a wide range of organic synthetic routes, attracting attention in both academic and industrial research. Among metal-containing catalysts, POMs represent a particularly relevant family of homogeneous catalysts for epoxidation reactions, with mainly H2O2 as an oxidant.2 Since late 2000, many POM@MOF systems for the catalytic epoxidation of alkenes under heterogeneous conditions have also been synthesised and tested, showing as well their very high efficiency. This will be the main subject of this section, while some other oxidation reactions of alkenes will be also underlined.
MIL-101(Cr) has been widely used for hosting POM species in its pores for performing alkene oxidation reactions, with a large variety of POMs (PW4, PW9, PW11, SiW11, PW12, PW11Co, PW11Ti, PZnMo2W9, P2W18Co4 and Ln(PW11)2) (Table 1). Scarce examples of POM@MIL-100(Fe), POM@UiO-66 and POM@HKHUST-1 have also been reported. By contrast, coordination complexes have been much less studied than POMs, with a few examples of phthalocyanines@MOFs and porphyrins@MOFs for such reactions (see Table 2).
In 2008, Maksimchuk et al. reported a seminal study on the oxidation in acetonitrile of three alkenes, namely α-pinene, caryophyllene and cyclohexene with POM@MIL-101(Cr) materials (Scheme 1).36 They showed that PW11Ti@MIL-101(Cr) and PW11Co@MIL-101(Cr) catalyse the oxidation of selected alkenes with H2O2 and O2, respectively. In all cases, the yields are much higher with the composite than with the POM-free MIL-101(Cr) material. It could be, however, noticed that the activity of MIL-101(Cr) was significantly higher for the oxidation of caryophyllene, performed at 50 °C, than for the oxidation of α-pinene, performed at 30 °C. This is consistent with the chromium MOF activating more efficiently H2O2 at 50 °C than at 30 °C. In addition, this underlines that the activity of a given POM@MOF composite must always be compared with that of the related POM-free MOF under exactly the same conditions. The POM-free MIL-101(Cr) matrix does not significantly oxidise cyclohexene in the presence of H2O2 even at 70 °C. Considering α-pinene, the substrate mainly converts to the allylic oxidation products, verbenol and verbenone, with both oxidants and with conversion yields and TOF up to 45% and 80 h−1, respectively, for PW11Co@MIL-101(Cr) (2 h, O2). The selectivity is higher than if the oxidation is carried out with the related mesoporous silica-supported POM systems.247 This can be attributed to the MIL-101's zeotype porous structure and the smaller pore diameters which may protect allylic oxidation products from further oxidation. Concerning cyclohexene, its oxidation in the presence of PW11Ti@MIL-101(Cr) and H2O2 leads mainly to 2-cyclohexen-1-ol and 2-cyclohexen-1-one, pointing to a homolytic mechanism. Finally, with the same oxidant and catalyst, caryophyllene was successfully oxidised to caryophyllene 4,5-monoepoxide, with a 100% selectivity. In comparison with homogeneous systems, such a high selectivity was attributed to the deprotonation of PW11Ti when immobilised into MIL-101(Cr), further protecting the acid-sensitive epoxide from ring opening. Also, it was shown that the PW11Co@MIL-101(Cr) composite maintains its activity and selectivity for α-pinene oxidation with O2 over at least 5 cycles. However, when H2O2 is used as the oxidant, relatively mild conditions must be considered for both catalysts in order to maintain the matrix supramolecular network and prevent POM leaching (T ≤ 50 °C, [H2O2] ≤ 0.2 M).36

Two years later, the same group studied two related materials for the oxidation of various alkenes in the presence of hydrogen peroxide in acetonitrile (T = 50 °C): PW4@MIL-101(Cr), which incorporates the Venturello complex, [PW4O24]3−, and PW12@MIL-101(Cr).30 The two composites exhibited similar activities, comparable to those of the polyoxometalates under homogeneous conditions. The 5 wt%PW12@MIL-101(Cr) was found to be particularly efficient for the epoxidation of cyclohexene, with a conversion yield of 84% and a selectivity of 80% (t = 3 h, TOF = 0.40 min−1). Very interestingly, a one-pot procedure combining both the synthesis of the composite and the cyclohexene oxidation showed that the epoxide is obtained with a yield superior to the one obtained when the composite is first prepared and then used as a catalyst. The POM is more resistant to hydrogen peroxide once introduced into the MOF. This allows a higher H2O2/alkene ratio and thus higher alkene conversion and epoxide selectivity than those observed under homogeneous conditions. The recyclability tests performed on these systems showed that the Venturello-containing PW4@MIL-101(Cr) material is stable over four consecutive runs with only a slight decrease in the epoxide yield after the third run, while for PW12@MIL-101(Cr) the activity starts to decrease after the fourth run (Fig. 22).

Bromberg et al. also studied epoxidation reactions using PW12@MIL-101(Cr) as the catalyst, but rather under microwave conditions (55 °C, 300 mW power source).44 For caryophyllene, a 93% yield was reached only after 5 min, with a TOF estimated as ca. 22-fold higher than that measured with the PW11Ti@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst under conventional heating. Undoubtedly, such an acceleration under otherwise similar conditions and analogous catalysts is assigned to the use of microwaves. Moreover, under the considered catalytic conditions, the excellent recyclability of the catalyst was evidenced, as the kinetics of the degradation of such a composite is minimal in short heating cycles (5 min).
In 2013, Granadeiro et al. developed analogous catalytic systems considering the monovacant [PW11O39]7− and [SiW11O39]8− POMs for the epoxidation of cis-cyclooctene, geraniol and R-(+)-limonene (Scheme 2), with H2O2 as an oxidant.34 PW11@MIL-101(Cr) shows the best activity for the epoxidation of cis-cyclooctene, while SiW11@MIL-101(Cr) is more active for the epoxidation of geraniol. The activities of PW11@MIL-101(Cr) and SiW11@MIL-101(Cr) are similar for the epoxidation of R-(+)-limonene. This suggests that there is not a “best POM@MOF system” for epoxidation reactions, but that the composite must be tuned in order to optimize the catalytic activity for a given substrate. The reactions were performed in acetonitrile, at room temperature for geraniol and at 75 °C for the other two alkenes. cis-Cyclooctene was selectively converted into 1,2-epoxycyclooctane in the presence of PW11@MIL-101(Cr) with high yields (98%) after 10 min (TOF = 1922 mol molPOM−1 h−1). In contrast, using an equivalent amount of PW11 under homogeneous conditions, the conversion of the substrate was inexistent after 10 min, with such yields being reached only after 6 h.

Considering a mechanism involving the formation of POM hydroperoxide species followed by an oxygen transfer to the substrate,248 the authors proposed that under heterogeneous conditions the porous cage of the MOF – where the catalyst, oxidant and substrate are confined – promotes a faster formation of hydroperoxide species and oxygen transfer than under homogeneous conditions. It was also shown that SiW11@MIL-101(Cr) selectively oxidises geraniol into 2,3-epoxygeraniol (yield = 89%, TOF = 875, selectivity = 100%), yet with an activity lower than that determined with SiW11 under homogeneous conditions (yield = 98%, TOF = 1000, selectivity = 100%). In many cases, it remains difficult to rationalise the relative catalytic activities of the heterogeneous POM@MOF vs. the homogeneous POM catalysts, which are obviously substrate-dependent. Besides, the reported materials also showed a high activity in the oxidation of R-(+)-limonene, leading to limonene-1,2-epoxide, limonene-1,2-diol and a small amount of diepoxide (Scheme 2). Finally, 10% and 17% POM leaching after three consecutive cycles were observed for SiW11@MIL-101(Cr) (oxidation of geraniol) and PW11@MIL-101(Cr) (oxidation of cis-cyclooctene), respectively.34
The trivacant POM [A-PW9O34]9− was also considered for the oxidation of geraniol and R-(+)-limonene.32 The PW9@MIL-101(Cr) was particularly active for the epoxidation of geraniol, with an activity superior to that found for PW11@MIL-101(Cr) and SiW11@MIL-101(Cr). Under analogous conditions, complete conversions in 30 min and 2 h were found using PW9@MIL-101(Cr) and SiW11@MIL-101(Cr), respectively. As expected, a lower activity of PW9@MIL-101(Cr) was determined for the epoxidation of R-(+)-limonene. However, a conversion of 93% was obtained after 2 h of reaction (acetonitrile, T = 80 °C, 1 mmol of substrate, 3 μmol of PW9, 4.5 mmol of H2O2). As for the studies involving the monovacant species, a mixture of epoxide, diol and diepoxide products was obtained. The recyclability was studied for the geraniol oxidation reaction. The conversion data were nearly the same over three consecutive cycles after 2 h, although the kinetic profile showed a significant loss of activity during the first minutes of reaction starting with the second cycle, suggesting an evolution of the PW9@MIL-101(Cr) material. As no PW9 leaching was observed, this was attributed to the evolution of the incorporated trivacant POM under catalytic conditions.32 Besides monomeric Keggin-type POMs, the catalytic activity of the sandwich-type [(PW9O34)2Co4(H2O)2]10− POM incorporated in MIL-101(Cr) was also investigated and compared to that of the same POM but incorporated into the APTES-functionalized (APTES = 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane) mesoporous silica APTES-SBA-15.62 For the geraniol and the R-(+)-limonene substrates, the epoxidation activity is higher with P2W18Co4@MIL-101(Cr) than with P2W18Co4@APTES-SBA-15. This was interpreted in terms of a postulated higher mobility of the POM in the MOF than in APTES-SBA-15 – which increases the POM's activity – and strong interactions between the POM's catalytic centres and the functionalised SBA – which decrease the POM's activity. The activity of P2W18Co4@MIL-101(Cr) was also compared to that of the homogeneous P2W18Co4 catalyst. For both systems, a complete conversion of geraniol into 2,3-epoxygeraniol is reached after 4 h (RT, acetonitrile), but the conversion is almost complete for the homogeneous system after 1 h only.62 The Venturello derivative [BW4O24]5− incorporated in MIL-101(Cr) has been also studied for geraniol oxidation. In the presence of the BW4@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst, the substrate was fully oxidised after 3 h (RT, acetonitrile, H2O2), leading to 2,3-epoxygeraniol with a selectivity of 78%.31 However, a significant leaching of the POM (47%) was observed after three cycles.
The oxidation of alkenes into epoxides was also reported for coordination complexes inserted in porous MOFs. The catalytic activity of a copper phthalocyanine complex (CuPc) inserted into MIL-100(Fe) or MIL-101(Cr) was studied by Yeganeh et al. for the oxidation of styrene. They used two oxidative pathways: molecular dioxygen and isobutyraldehyde as a co-reductant or TBHP (tert-butyl hydroperoxide).149 A poor selectivity was observed with TBHP. Indeed, CuPc@MIL-101(Cr) allowed a quantitative conversion of styrene but benzaldehyde (47.5%) and epoxide (45.6%) were obtained in similar proportions. With the same catalyst, the selectivity was improved with the O2/isobutyraldehyde system since 85% of epoxide was recovered with a 100% conversion (T = 60 °C, t = 4 h). With CuPc@MIL-100(Fe), the performances were slightly lower under the same conditions: 82.8% conversion and 76.1% selectivity towards epoxide. This may be explained by the smaller pore windows of MIL-100(Fe) when compared to those of MIL-101(Cr), which restrict the diffusion of substrates into the cavities where CuPc-active sites are confined. Importantly, as confirmed by the PXRD patterns of the recycled catalysts, the structural integrity of the catalysts was preserved after three to four consecutive runs. Moreover, despite the very slight decrease of the selectivity towards epoxide, the catalytic activity remains almost unchanged. For the most effective CuPc@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst, 100% of styrene was still converted after the 4th run and a selectivity of 80.6% (epoxide) was obtained with the O2/isobutyraldehyde oxidative system.149
In 2013, Bogaerts et al. successfully immobilised chiral Jacobsen's catalyst (Mn-Salen) into amino functionalised NH2-MIL-101(Al) aiming to achieve enantioselective epoxidation of dihydronaphthalene with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA) and N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO).150 Even if the resulting Mn-Salen@NH2-MIL-101(Al) material yielded a lower conversion (69%) than the pure Mn–Salen complex in a homogeneous medium (82%), the enantiomeric excess was surprisingly similar in both cases (70%ee). Ab initio calculations pointed out the essential role of the folded structure of the complex, maintaining its optimal shape in the porous network, which induced selectivity of the substrate (Fig. 23, see Section 4 for details). Notably, after 4 runs, the stability of the structure of Mn-Salen@NH2-MIL-101(Al) was assessed by XRD, with no complex leaching. In addition, the TON values remained constant for the 4 runs, demonstrating the reusability of the catalyst.

Metal porphyrins incorporated into porous structures have also been employed for the epoxidation of alkenes. In 2016, Zhang et al. synthesised the sodalite-type ZIF-8 (Zn(MeIM)2, MeIM = 2-methylimidazolate) surrounding manganese meso-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)-porphyrins (Mn-TAPP) – with both parts interacting through H-bonds.168 Oxidation of different alkenes was achieved in acetonitrile at 80 °C with TBHP as an oxidant and the resulting Mn-TAPP@ZIF-8 as a catalyst. Interestingly, the catalytic results showed a substrate size selectivity induced by the structure of the composite, with the oxidation reaction taking place inside the pores of the framework. As an example, after 24 h of reaction, the conversions of cyclooctene and cyclohexene reached 62% and 96%, respectively, although cyclohexene is usually considered as more difficult to oxidize than cyclooctene. Kinetic studies also revealed some limitations in the diffusion of the substrate to attain the active sites within the structure. Still, Mn-TAPP@ZIF-8 exhibited impressive catalytic performances. For the epoxidation of cyclohexene, Mn-TAPP@ZIF-8 presented high conversion, high selectivity (>99%) and, above all, the highest TON value (7600) when compared to previously reported catalytic systems. Especially, the low catalytic activity of homogeneous Mn-TAPP (52% conversion, 48% of epoxide) underlined the key role of the ZIF-8 framework that prevents the formation of catalytically inactive μ-oxometalloporphyrin dimers. In addition, the structural integrity and stability of Mn-TAPP@ZIF-8 were checked after 3 cycles, explaining a stable conversion and selectivity over time.
Apart from these oxidation reactions leading to epoxide functions, some MOF-based hybrid systems were also reported for the formation of carbonyl derivatives by catalytic oxidation of alkenes. The oxidation of styrene using the P2W18Co4@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst (80 °C, H2O2, acetonitrile) showed that the substrate was mainly oxidised into benzaldehyde, with hydroxy ketone and benzoic acid as secondary products (Fig. 24a).62 The heterogeneous system was more active than the homogeneous counterparts (Fig. 24b), with yields of 85 and 64% after 4 h, respectively. This was attributed to the faster degradation of the oxidant under homogeneous conditions. In addition, the oxidation of styrene by the lanthanide sandwich-type [Ln(PW11O39)2]11− (Ln = Eu, Sm) POMs incorporated in MIL-101(Cr) was investigated under the same experimental conditions. An almost complete conversion was observed after 4 h for both Eu(PW11)2@MIL-101(Cr) and Sm(PW11)2@MIL-101(Cr).64 In contrast, the conversion was considerably low under homogeneous conditions (40% and 57% for Eu(PW11)2 and Sm(PW11)2, respectively).

The latter results were again interpreted in terms of the beneficial confinement effect promoted by MIL-101's cages acting as nanoreactors. The authors also compared the reactions performed under thermal (75 °C) and microwave heating (75 °C, 70 mW). In contrast to the study mentioned above,44 the conversion yields were found to be similar for both heating conditions. However, the selectivity was enhanced under microwaves, with a selectivity for benzaldehyde after 1 h of 98% when using Eu(PW11)2@MIL-101(Cr). Finally, leaching was observed for both materials. In particular, free Sm(PW11)2 was detected in solution after three 6 h catalytic cycles with Sm(PW11)2@MIL-101(Cr) as a catalyst, with the conversion yield decreasing from 100% for the first catalytic cycle to ca. 60% after the third one. Surprisingly, the conversion yield measured using Eu(PW11)2@MIL-101(Cr) remained constant over the three cycles.
Considering Complex@MOF catalysts, Wu et al. successfully incorporated copper complexes (Cu-Schiff) with bis-salicylaldiminato Schiff bases acting as ligands into MIL-101(Cr).147 The resulting composites Cu-Schiff@MIL-101(Cr)(x) – where x refers to the Cu-Schiff/MIL-101(Cr) molar ratio – were tested as catalysts for the oxidation of styrene into benzaldehyde with H2O2 as an oxidant in a buffer solution at 30 °C (Tris–HCl, pH = 7.6). The reaction rate constant k increased from 0.087 min−1 for the bare MIL-101(Cr) to 0.378 min−1 for Cu-Schiff@MIL-101(Cr)(4), which exhibited the greatest styrene conversion (93.5%). A higher loading of copper complex into the MOF was reported to block the accessibility of the active centres, thus lowering the catalytic activity (k = 0.310 min−1 for Cu-Schiff@MIL-101(Cr)(8)). Despite the strong hydrophobic interactions between the complex and the MOF, recyclability tests pointed out a systematic leaching of the complex. Therefore, k decreased in a constant manner after each cycle and reached half of its initial value after 6 runs.
In 2011, Kockrick et al. described the immobilisation of two perfluorinated phthalocyanine derivatives, MPcF16 (M = Ru, Fe) and the dimer (FePctBu4)2N, into MIL-101(Cr).144 Taking into account the slight differences in the phthalocyanines’ loadings, the catalytic activities of the three new composites were compared under similar conditions for the selective oxidation of tetralin into tetralone, a diesel fuel additive (oxidant: O2 at 8 bars, 90 °C). With FePcF16 species, greater selectivity toward tetralone (80% for FePcF16@MIL-101(Cr) vs. 68% for FePcF16) and a higher TON (24200 for FePcF16@MIL-101(Cr) vs. 3400 for FePcF16) were observed when the metal phthalocyanine was incorporated into the MOF, even if the conversions after 6 h were quite similar for the composite and the related pure complex (Fig. 25).
 Fig. 25  Tetralin conversion (solid line) and selectivity toward 1-tetralone (dashed line) of the homogeneous FePcF16 complex (grey) and of the FePcF16@MIL-101(Cr) composite (black) with significantly lower catalyst contents (n(tetralin):n(FePcF16) = 147000:1) compared to the pure complexes (36000:1) explaining the clear difference in turnover number (TON) after 6 h and 24 h (inset), respectively. Reprinted from ref. 144 with permission from the RSC. 
This remarkable enhancement of the catalytic activity in the heterogeneous systems may be explained by the MOF precluding the undesired dimerisation of phthalocyanines, which operates under homogeneous conditions through π stacking. In contrast, (FePctBu4)2N@MIL-101(Cr) showed a very low conversion (4% after 6 h) and a TON of 5100, close to the value of (FePctBu4)2N (7400). Indeed, the size of the dimer prevented its incorporation into the MOF, leading to its placement at the external surfaces of the crystallites. Consequently, the synergetic effect expected from the confinement of the metal complexes was not observed here. It should be noted that an induction period of 3 h was observed for the MPcF16@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst. This specific behavior was consistent with a free radical mechanism of oxidation.144
In 2017, cyclohexene oxidation was also deeply investigated with the incorporation of PMo12 or Keggin phosphomolybdovanadates (PMo11V and PMo10V2) into MIL-100(Fe) using H2O2 as an oxidant.84 A great enhancement in the conversion of cyclohexene (72–85%) was obtained with the PMo12@MIL-100(Fe), PMo11V@MIL-100(Fe) and PMo10V2@MIL-100(Fe) catalysts when compared to those obtained with the POMs or MOF alone (31–37%). These results underline the high accessibility of the active sites of the POM@MOF composites to reagents. While 1,2-cyclohexanediol (54%) was the major product with PMo12@MIL-100(Fe), 2-cyclohexen-1-one was selectively formed using PMo11V@MIL-100(Fe) or PMo10V2@MIL-100(Fe). Particularly, PMo11V@MIL-100(Fe) appeared as the best catalyst for cyclohexene conversion (85%), selectivity in 2-cyclohexen-1-one (91%) and TOF (715 h−1) under optimised conditions (acetonitrile, 70 °C, 9 h). Importantly, these values remained almost unchanged after 5 cycles, showing the stability and the reusability of the catalyst.
In 2015, Yang et al. considered the UiO-66 MOF as a host material for the design of POM-containing catalytic systems for the oxidation of alkenes.91 The PW12@UiO-66 composite was prepared and studied for the oxidation of cyclopentene into glutaraldehyde. While the POM-free MOF was able to oxidise the substrate under the selected catalytic conditions (H2O2, t-BuOH, 35 °C, 22% conversion yield after 24 h), the incorporation of PW12 into the MOF pores greatly enhanced its catalytic performances. Upon optimising the amount of immobilised POM, 35 wt%PW12@UiO-66 reached the highest conversion (84%) and selectivity (80%). This loading was thus considered as a good compromise between the number of active sites and the accessible volume of the material. Moreover, the selectivity for glutaraldehyde was dramatically increased with the POM@MOF when compared to the POM-free MOF (80% and 18%, respectively). Although some leaching was found after three consecutive catalytic cycles because of the release of PW12 species adsorbed at the surfaces of the MOF particles, cycling did not result in any significant decrease in the selectivity. Overall, the optimised material competed well for the oxidation of cyclopentene to glutaraldehyde with other efficient heterogeneous systems such as 20 wt%WO3-MCF (MCF = mesocellular silica foam).249
Recently, Song et al. considered a series of polyoxomolybdate@UiO-67 composites.107 First, it was found that CoHPMo12@MOF materials were more active than PMo12O40@MOF ones for the epoxidation of cyclooctene (H2O2, acetonitrile), evidencing the beneficial role of Co ions. Secondly, a UiO-67 functionalised with 2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′-dicarboxylate instead of 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylate linkers improved the conversion (91%) and the selectivity (>99%) (70 °C, acetonitrile, 6 h) using CoHPMo12@UiO-67(bpy), while a conversion of 82% was found with CoHPMo12@UiO-67. In addition, the excellent stability and recyclability of CoHPMo12@UiO-67(bpy) compared to those of the CoHPMo12@UiO-67 composite revealed that the bpy linkers play a critical role (Fig. 26). Further comparison with the catalytic activity of organic polymers incorporating the CoHPMo12 POM suggests that the MOF matrix is a better candidate for the preparation of composites for such epoxidation reactions. CoHPMo12@UiO-67(bpy) was also the most efficient phosphomolybdate@UiO-67 material reported in this study for the oxidation of styrene in the presence of dioxygen with t-BuOOH as an initiator (80 °C, solvent-free conditions), with a 80% conversion and a 59% selectivity to styrene epoxide. Notably, the three other materials studied (CoHPMo12O40@UiO-67, PMo12@UiO-67(bpy) and PMo12@UiO-67) exhibited selectivity toward benzaldehyde rather than styrene epoxide, as observed for Ln(PW11)2@MIL-101(Cr) systems.64 Overall, the high performances of CoHPMo12@UiO-67(bpy) were assigned to the ideal confinement of the POM provided by the cages of UiO-67(bpy).107

POM@Cu-MOFs were also considered for alkene oxidation studies. In 2015, Yang et al. prepared the PW12@meso-HKUST-1 material for the selective oxidation of cyclopentene to glutaraldehyde.126tert-Butyl hydroperoxide was chosen as an oxidant rather than H2O2, which rapidly decomposes in the reaction medium upon addition of the catalyst, probably due to the action of the copper MOF. Among the various loadings considered, the 30 wt%PW12@meso-HKUST-1 composite was found to be the most active one, with a conversion yield of 93% and a selectivity to glutaraldehyde of 79% (30 °C, acetonitrile, 36 h). In comparison, the POM-free meso-HKUST-1 under the same conditions presented a conversion yield of 28%, with a selectivity of 80% to cyclopentenone. Interestingly, the 30 wt%PW12@HKUST-1 material (with microporosity only) presented a lower yield (76%) with a poor selectivity to glutaraldehyde (20%). This difference was explained considering that the microporous structure of 30 wt%PW12@HKUST-1 was not suitable for the formation of the bulky glutaraldehyde but beneficial for that of the smaller cyclopentenone with 80% selectivity. This highlights the advantage of using the mesoporous HKUST-1 MOF. The role of the solvent is also highlighted. When performed in ethanol instead of acetonitrile, the conversion yields and selectivity dramatically decreased, indicating that aprotic solvents are beneficial to the reaction. In addition, as observed in numerous studies, an excess of oxidant can increase the activity, with an optimised cyclopentene:tert-butyl hydroperoxide ratio of 1.0:2.5 here. Finally, only a very small decrease of conversion and selectivity was observed after three consecutive cycles, attributed to the slight POM leaching together with the adsorption of oxidised products on the composite, showing overall the high stability of 30 wt%PW12@HKUST-1.
Sun et al. reported one year later a new catalytic POM@Cu-MOF family.136 Three materials were studied, namely PMo12@rht-MOF-1, SiMo12@rht-MOF-1 and PW12@rht-MOF-1, for reacting alkylbenzenes with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (80 °C, 12–36 h). In all cases, the presence of the POM enhanced the activity of the material, with the POM-free MOF exhibiting also a significant activity. Considering the methylbenzene substrate, a conversion yield of 64% with a selectivity to benzoic acid of 81% was observed after 12 h using the rht-MOF-1 catalyst, while the use of PMo12@rht-MOF-1 led to conversion and selectivity yields of 99%. We note that the PMo12 material is more active than the PW12 one, with the SiW12-based composite presenting the lowest activity. When ethylbenzene was considered as the substrate, the major product was the corresponding ketone (81% conversion yield, 89% selectivity with PMo12@rht-MOF-1, after 12 h). Also, the conversion yields were strongly dependent on the size of the substrate (Fig. 27). For example, the conversion yield of the large 4-ethylbiphenyl into ketone was the lowest one at 54% after 12 h. The authors concluded that the Cu(II) sites in the channel walls and the POMs in the voids could be more easily reached for substrates with smaller size, thus allowing higher catalytic activities than with bulky substrates, for which the reaction could only occur at the crystallites’ surfaces.

In 2016, Choluj et al. reported for the first time the incorporation of ruthenium alkylidene complexes (Fig. 28) into a MOF structure to perform olefin metathesis catalysis.152 Due to the large sizes of the Hoveyda–Grubbs second generation complexes used, NH2-MIL-101(Al) was selected as a large-pore host (Fig. 28). Still, the first attempts in catalysis with the resulting materials were discouraging, as the possible presence of OH− in the MOF host could be poisonous for this kind of catalysis. The possible sequestration of the Ru-bound chloride anions by the Lewis acidic sites (after activation of the MOF) could also contribute to the decrease in the catalyst's activity. A pretreatment of the MOF with HCl was shown to be necessary to overcome these issues, giving rise to NH2-MIL-101(Al)·HCl. The excellent yields in ring-closing olefin metathesis (RCM) reactions performed in toluene at room temperature evidenced the recovery of the catalytic activity. Importantly, even a very low content of Ru complexes in the MOF (one molecule every 10 cages), associated with a very low amount of POM@MOF catalyst (0.01%) allows a high conversion of the substrate. In addition, this heterogeneous catalyst was successfully tested under continuous flow conditions in a model RCM reaction releasing ethylene. Under the optimised conditions (40 °C, 9 h, rate of 10 μL min−1, retention time <7 min), an average conversion of 57% was obtained with a high TON of 4700. Notably, no leaching of the Ru complex was observed, highlighting the stability of the composite.

At the same time, another example of incorporation of an organometallic catalyst into a MOF was studied by Grigoropoulos et al.172 As a proof of concept, they successfully achieved the immobilisation of the cationic Lewis acidic [CpFe(CO)2L]+ species (denoted as [Fp-L]+, Cp = η5-C5H5, L = weakly bound solvent) into the anionic [In3(BTC)4]3− porous framework through a controlled cation exchange process. The final [(Fp-L)0.6(Et4N)2.4][In3(BTC)4] material was tested as a heterogeneous catalyst for the Diels–Alder [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between isoprene (Iso) and methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) in dichloromethane. With 10 mol% [Fe]/[MVK] loading and an [Iso]/[MVK] ratio of 4, the yield of the reaction reached 45% after 96 h at room temperature. Even if the homogeneous catalysis showed better results under similar conditions (67% yield after 48 h), the catalytic activity of [(Fp-L)0.6(Et4N)2.4][In3(BTC)4] validated the synthetic cation exchange strategy adopted for the heterogenisation of such catalysts. The composite was reused at least 3 times, with however some loss of activity (yield of 27% in the third cycle). IR spectroscopy revealed a slow, partial decomposition of the complex, as already reported for [Fp-L]+ under homogeneous conditions.


5.1.2 Oxidation of alcohols. 
Entrapment of catalytically active metal complexes into a MOF framework constitutes also a strategy to build efficient heterogeneous catalytic systems for the oxidation of alcohols. Zalomaeva et al. successfully incorporated controlled loadings of an iron tetrasulfonatophthalocyanine (FePcS) complex into highly stable MIL-101(Cr).145 They studied the oxidation of benzyl alcohol using TBHP as an oxidant (60 °C, acetonitrile). While 15 wt%FePcS@MIL-101(Cr) and homogeneous FePcS showed similar performances (ca. 32% conversion after 2 h), a faster conversion of 32% in 15 min was observed for 5 wt%FePcS@MIL-101(Cr). This indicated a better accessibility of active Fe-centres at lower loadings. The efficiency of 5 wt%FePcS@MIL-101(Cr) vs the homogeneous catalyst was confirmed with the oxidation of aromatic alcohols into the corresponding quinones. Conversions of 2,3,6-trimethylphenol (TMP) or 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-HQ) were indeed almost complete in only 15 min, whereas conversions of 56% and 67% were, respectively, observed for FePcS(NBu4)4 under homogeneous conditions. These striking differences mainly came from the affinity of MIL-101(Cr) to aromatic species, making it easily penetrable. Compared to systems with FePcS immobilised into other supports, 5 wt%FePcS@MIL-101(Cr) gave rise to faster reactions kinetics. As an example, comparable yields in the oxidation of 8-HQ into quinoline-5,8-dione were obtained after 2–6 h for FePcS/SiO2 (31–66%) and FePcS/MCM-41 (40–55%) and after only 15 min for 5 wt%FePcS@MIL-101(Cr) (53%). Finally, no leaching of iron or chromium was evidenced, proving the stability of this heterogeneous catalyst.
Challenging selective oxidation of alcohols into aldehydes or ketones was also performed by POM@MOF materials. In 2017, Abednatanzi et al. investigated these reactions using a three-component MOF-based material.53 The catalyst denoted PW12/DAIL/MIL-101(Cr) (DAIL = dually aminofunctionalized ionic liquid) consisted of the immobilisation of the Keggin-type PW12 into MIL-101(Cr) which was previously modified with an aminofunctionalized ionic liquid. The catalytic activity of this original composite was compared to those of other systems for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde using TBHP as an oxidant in chloroform (100 °C, 6 h). Importantaly, the incorporation of the amino group of DAIL into the structure allowed a better accessibility of the oxidant through hydrogen bonding, thus enhancing the catalytic performance of PW12/DAIL/MIL-101(Cr) (95% conversion with 0.9 mmol g−1 DAIL loading) compared to PW12@MIL-101(Cr) (70% conversion). The efficiency of PW12/DAIL/MIL-101(Cr) was demonstrated not only by its high selectivity towards benzaldehyde (>99%) but also by excellent TON values (1900) with respect to other POM-based catalytic systems. The integrity of the structure was maintained for 5 consecutive runs with no leaching detected, which contributed overall to constant catalytic activity (Fig. 29).
 Fig. 29  Recyclability of the PW12/DAIL/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst. Reprinted from ref. 53 with permission from the RSC. 
Some of the contributors pursued this strategy by incorporating the PW4 peroxopolyoxotungstate into MIL-100(Fe) previously modified with DAIL.77 The resulting PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) material was also tested under the same conditions as described for PW12/DAIL/MIL-101(Cr).53 Even if the catalyst exhibited excellent selectivity (>99%) and a higher conversion (92% with 1.2 mmol g−1 DAIL loading) than MIL-100(Fe) (38%) or PW12/MIL-100(Fe) (65%), the measured TON (613) was much lower than that of PW12/DAIL/MIL-101(Cr).
In 2014, Zhu et al. chose copper-based HKUST-1 as a host material for the immobilisation of various POMs (PW4, PMo12 and PMo10V2).116 PW4@HKUST-1 was used for the green oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H2O2 (80 °C, 3 h) and exhibited a higher efficiency (98% conversion) in CTAB micellar solution than in other media. Micelles, displaying both hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts, allowed the reaction to take place at their surfaces, overcoming the solubility issues of the substrates, oxidant and catalyst. Another benefit of using PW4@HKUST-1 and PMo12@HKUST-1 was the selectivity, wherein benzaldehyde was the only detected product, while benzoic acid was also generated with the vanadium-containing POM. The catalytic activity also depends on the substrate's size. With PW4@HKUST-1 as a model catalyst, the conversion of 4-tert-butylbenzyl alcohol (65%) was much lower than that of benzyl alcohol despite the positive electronic substituent effect of the tert-butyl substituent. It is proposed that benzyl alcohol, with smaller size, could diffuse more easily through the pores. It should also be noted that a wide range of aliphatic, allylic and benzylic alcohols were converted specifically to the carbonyl products with good to excellent yields, and the double bonds were not affected by the oxidation process. Finally, considering the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, the recycled catalyst PW4@HKUST-1 was used for 5 consecutive runs without a significant loss of activity.
POMs encapsulated into the HKUST-1 framework were also employed for the degradation of pollutants, specifically phenol in water. Peculiarly, PW12 was inserted into the MOF via a liquid-assisted grinding method, leading to the nanocrystalline NENU-3N catalyst formulated as [Cu2(BTC)4/3(H2O)2]6[HPW12O40].129 With particles’ size of 85 nm, NENU-3N showed a high efficiency for the degradation of phenol (97% elimination after 1 h) and total organic compound (TOC) removal (88% reduction after 1 h) with H2O2 as an oxidant at 35 °C. The oxidation of phenol was then achieved in acetonitrile due to the low stability of HKUST-1 in water. Chiefly, the results pointed out the synergy between the POM and the MOF since the removal of phenol in 1 h was more important with NENU-3N (55%) than with PW12 (26%), HKUST-1 (35%) or a mixture of PW12 and HKUST-1 (40%). From a mechanistic point of view, it was proposed that H2O2 was activated by both the MOF's and POMs’ active sites to generate strongly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals and peroxo species which initiated the oxidation of phenol (Fig. 30). Phenol is first oxidised into aromatic intermediates like benzoquinone that are transformed into short-chain carboxylic acids, which are further partially transformed into CO2. Lastly, the observed constant efficiency over 5 cycles and proven structural stability both confirmed NENU-3N as a promising catalyst with an enhanced activity due to dual catalytic sites (POM and MOF).

While the pores’ sizes of MOFs mostly belong to the microporous range, it is possible via various synthetic routes to construct mesoporous and/or macroporous MOF-based materials (hierarchically porous MOFs) which can display improved catalytic properties compared to microporous systems. With this idea in mind, Li et al. synthesised via the gel-like/freeze-drying method the hierarchically porous NENU-9HP-1/120 composite (where ‘HP’ means a hierarchical pore, ‘1’ is the concentration of the added copper source in mmol, ‘120’ is the total volume in mL of ethanol used for the synthesis), made of PMo10V2 species encapsulated in HKUST-1.133 The oxidation of 1-phenylethanol into acetophenone with TBHP as an oxidant (toluene, 100 °C, 7 h) was then investigated with a group of catalysts. As expected, NENU-9HP-1/120 allowed a higher conversion (97%) than the POM (38%) or the hierarchically porous HKUST-1 (50%) alone. Due to its unique structure, NENU-9HP-1/120 exhibited enhanced catalytic activity when compared with that of the microporous nanosized NENU-9N (66%) and NENU-9HT (39%). TOF analysis confirmed these results with values of 249 h−1 and 114 h−1 for NENU-9HP-1/120 and NENU-9HT, respectively. Such differences emanate from NENU-9HP-1/120's mesoporous channels that are conducive to the mass transfer of substrates and products as well as a greater number of exposed active sites. Besides, on studying linear primary alcohols, the impact of the substrate's length was highlighted. While only a slight decrease in conversion was observed for NENU-9HP-1/120 from n-butanol to n-octanol (94% to 87%), the conversion decreased for NENU-9HT (90% to 30%). Interestingly, the hierarchically porous structure of NENU-9HP-1/120 was maintained after 5 catalytic cycles with intact mesopores and high catalytic activity (80% conversion for the oxidation of phenylethanol), proving its great stability.


5.1.3 Oxidation of alkanes. 
Several groups investigated the oxidation of alkanes using metalloporphyrins immobilised into MOFs. In 2008, Alkordi et al. successfully incorporated cationic 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridinio)porphyrin ([H2TMPyP]4+) into the anionic (indium-imidazoledicarboxylate)-based rho-ZMOF (zeolite-like MOF) taking advantage of highly favourable host–guest electrostatic interactions.174 The post-synthetic metalation of the porphyrin using a manganese salt led to the Mn-TMPyP@rho-ZMOF material. The oxidation of cyclohexane was then investigated under neat conditions using a catalyst loading of 3.8%, TBHP as an oxidant and with an initial TBHP to cyclohexane molar ratio of 2/1. After 24 h of reaction at 65 °C, cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone were the only products detected (Fig. 31). The calculated total yield of 91.5% was significantly higher than that obtained with other heterogeneous catalysts possessing metalloporphyrins immobilised into zeolites or silica matrices. It is worth noting that rho-ZMOF or the free-base porphyrin into rho-ZMOF exhibited no catalytic activity, highlighting the specificity of Mn-TMPyP@rho-ZMOF. Moreover, the stability of the catalyst was corroborated by the absence of metalloporphyrin in solution and a constant efficiency under the reaction conditions up to 11 runs at least.

A few years later, the oxidation of cyclohexane with similar types of catalysts was investigated by Chen et al.156 In this case, a tris(1,10-phenanthroline) Cu(II) complex (CuPhen) was encapsulated in two steps into MIL-100(Al). The oxidation of the cycloalkane with the resulting CuPhen@MIL-100(Al) catalyst (0.55 wt% Cu content) was studied in acetonitrile using H2O2 as an oxidant. An increase of temperature led to a higher yield until 70 °C. Above that temperature the decomposition of H2O2 prevailed. Again, cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone were the only observed products with a 1:2 ratio. Interestingly, CuPhen@MIL-100(Al) showed a better conversion (21.4%) than CuPhen (12.3%), underlining the relative benefit of the encapsulation of the metal complex, which prevented its degradation by H2O2. Encapsulation of CuPhen in zeolite Y showed a lower catalytic conversion of 11.9%. This highlights the advantageous structural features of MIL-100(Al) whose large supercages (25 Å and 29 Å) and windows facilitate the diffusion of the substrate and stabilise active transition-states. However, a loss of catalytic activity probably due to the partial degradation of CuPhen under the reaction conditions was observed after 3 cycles (18.6% conversion in the 3rd run).


5.1.4 Oxidation of carbonyl compounds. 
In order to obtain the highly demanded adipic acid (AA) without forming toxic by-products, the oxidation of cyclohexanone by H2O2 with POM@MOF materials was considered. Feng et al. chose PW12 for its intrinsic catalytic properties and UiO-66 for its remarkable chemical and thermal stability.93 The AA yield using the composite (80.3%) was comparable to that of PW12 alone (88.7%), proving that its efficiency was maintained. The best catalytic performances were observed after 8 h of reaction at 90 °C and a molar H2O2:cyclohexanone ratio of 4:5. Notably, with these conditions, PW12@UiO-66 appears as one of the best heterogeneous catalysts reported so far for adipic acid synthesis in terms of yield. The AA yield remained unchanged over 5 consecutive cycles, demonstrating the stability of the composite material, further supported by XRD. In addition, no POM leaching was observed, in contrast to PW12@MIL-101(Cr) tested for the same reaction. In the latter case, the AA yield fell from 76.0% for the first cycle to 42.5% for the third cycle. This result highlights the relevant choice of UiO-66 as a host where the windows’ size allows keeping the POM trapped into the pores, while the larger windows’ size of MIL-101(Cr) cannot prevent the leaching of the POM.
Another key point in organic chemistry is the formation of amide bonds. Indeed, this functional group is observed in numerous chemical compounds of interest (natural products, polymers, …). The most studied reaction involves activated carboxylic acids and amines. Recently, Boroujeni et al. proposed for the first time to use a copper phthalocyanine complex incorporated into MIL-101(Cr), CuPc@MIL-101(Cr), for the oxidative amidation of aldehydes.148 As a model reaction, the synthesis of N-benzylbenzamide in acetonitrile starting from benzaldehyde and benzylamine hydrochloride in the presence of a base (CaCO3) and TBHP as an oxidant was investigated (Scheme 3). Amine hydrochloride salts were preferably used over free amines, which could be oxidised in the presence of TBHP. First, the amount of CuPc@MIL-101(Cr) composite was optimized until reaching 92% yield at room temperature. Under these conditions, CuPc@MIL-101(Cr) showed a higher yield than pristine MIL-101(Cr) (35% yield at 60 °C), homogeneous CuPc (10%) or Cu2+@MIL-101(Cr) (80%). In the latter composite, the initially good catalytic activity strongly decreased in the next run because of the leaching of the Cu2+ ions. In contrast, CuPc@MIL-101(Cr) could be reused after filtration, washing and drying for 6 consecutive runs without loss of activity. Moreover, the authors showed that the reaction with substituted benzaldehyde and benzylamine hydrochloride also took place with high yields (between 80 and 90%), confirming the efficiency of CuPc@MIL-101(Cr).

5.1.5 Peroxidase activity. 
Thanks to their unique features, MOFs appear as suitable platforms to encapsulate peroxidase mimetics. Notably, this subfield of investigation led to the development of the so-called MOMzyme-1 (Metal Organic Material enzyme) class of materials. This concept was initiated by Larsen et al. in 2011 with the entrapment of metalloporphyrins bearing four sulfonato groups (Fe4SP or Mn4SP) within the well-suited octahedral cages of HKUST-1 (Cu/Zn).170 The peroxidase activity of the iron-based MOMzyme-1 materials was assayed through the oxidation of 2,2′-azidodi(3-ethylbenzthiazoline)-6-sulfonate (ABTS) by H2O2. Still, the initial rate of ABTS˙+ formation was lower with Fe4SP@HKUST-1(Cu) than with a solution of microperoxidase-11 (MP-11), or of horse heart myoglobin (hhMb) or of Fe4SP. This was interpreted as a result of the limited diffusion of the substrate through the channels of HKUST-1. Nonetheless, the final ABTS conversion measured with Fe4SP@HKUST-1(Cu) (50%) was comparable to those obtained with MP-11 (52%) and Fe4SP (50%). These results highlighted the accessibility to the metalloporphyrin for the ABTS substrate and the preserved activity of the catalytic centre when immobilised into the MOF. Importantly, the MOF cavities ensured the stability of the catalytic complex, while the homogeneous counterpart became inactive because of intermolecular side-reactions between porphyrin macrocycles. Consistently, no decrease in the ABTS conversion yield was observed for 3 consecutive runs (55% after the third cycle).
Following the same concept of MOF-based bioinspired materials, Liu et al. achieved the incorporation of hemin (also called iron protoporphyrin IX), which is the active centre of the heme protein family, into NH2-MIL-101(Al).151 In fact, the initial MOF transformed into NH2-MIL-53(Al) during the impregnation step in DMF as evidenced by the powder XRD analysis. The peroxidase-like activity of the final Hemin@NH2-MIL-53(Al) composite material was then considered through the oxidation of the chromogenic TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) by H2O2 in a buffer solution (pH = 5). The immobilisation of the hemin into the MOF unambiguously improved its catalytic activity. During the reaction, Hemin@NH2-MIL-53(Al) generated a deep blue colour, indicating the formation of the oxidised form of TMB (Fig. 32). By contrast, no colour change occurred with TMB/H2O2 or MOF/TMB/H2O2 and a negligible coloration was detected with hemin/TMB/H2O2. An optimal temperature of 50 °C was established vs 40 °C for the hemin alone, pointing toward enhanced thermal stability upon immobilisation. Finally, the catalytic activity was maintained after 6 cycles although a small decrease was observed. Importantly, the catalysis was shown to follow typical Michaelis–Menten kinetics while adopting a ping-pong mechanism as observed for the native peroxidase. On this basis, Hemin@NH2-MIL-53(Al) found an application in a simple, sensitive and selective detection of glucose and H2O2via a colorimetric method.

5.1.6 Water oxidation. 
Oxidation of water to molecular dioxygen is a key task due to its high importance in the field of energy. In 2013 Nepal and Das immobilised the high-valent di-μ-oxo dimanganese water oxidation catalyst [(terpy)Mn(μ-O)2Mn(terpy)]3+ (terpy = 2,2′;6′,2′′-terpyridine), denoted as MnTD, into MIL-101(Cr), leading to the MnTD@MIL-101(Cr) heterogeneous catalyst.143 Oxygen evolution assays were performed in acetate buffer solution (pH 4.5) at 25 °C in the presence of the K-oxone (KHSO5) electron acceptor. Although high rates of O2 evolution were obtained with molecular MnTD for the first 200 s (TOF = 0.04 mol O2 (mol catalyst)−1 s−1), the system slowed down and stopped after 400 s. Even if the rate of catalysis was lower for MnTD@MIL-101(Cr) with a TOF value of 0.02 mol O2 (mol caged MnTD-species)−1 s−1, this system appeared to be much more efficient as oxygen was continuously produced over 7 h at the same rate (Fig. 33). Control experiments with MIL-101(Cr) only or MnTD adsorbed on the surface of the MOF failed in producing oxygen. The encapsulation of MnTD into the perfectly suited pores of MIL-101(Cr) was thus the key to obtaining a performing catalyst for oxygen evolution reactions.

In the case of MnTD@MIL-101(Cr), 100 μL K-oxone (200 mM) was added once the solution was deoxygenated with N2. Reprinted with permission from ref. 143.

5.1.7 Oxidation of sulfur-containing compounds. 
Fuel combustion leads to the production of SOx that are extremely damaging to the environment. It is now crucial to limit sulfur levels under 10 ppm in these fuels.250 Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and oxidative desulfurisation (ODS) are the two main techniques considered for desulfurization. HDS is widely used in the petroleum refining industry and is highly efficient for the degradation of sulfides. Unfortunately, HDS generally requires high pressures and temperatures and consumes high amounts of hydrogen.251 Moreover, it appears to be less efficient for the removal of sulfur-containing heterocycles. These drawbacks explain the current interest in ODS. In this process, the heterocyclic sulfur compounds are oxidised to the corresponding sulfoxides and sulfones and then removed by extraction.252 We are first going to focus on this methodology, before reviewing the oxidation of aliphatic sulfides by Cat@MOF materials. A rapid examination of Table 1 allows seeing that a large variety of MOF hosts have been studied for the immobilisation of POMs able to perform oxidation of sulfur-containing compounds. Among them, PW12 has been the most studied one, but PW9, PW11Zn, PMo12, PMo10V2, Tb(PW11)2 and Eu(PW11)2 have also been considered. To the best of our knowledge, no Complex@MOF (Table 2) has been prepared for this kind of reaction.
5.1.7.1 Oxidation of sulfur-containing heterocycles. 
In recent years, the ability of POMs to act as ODS catalysts has been clearly demonstrated.253,254 Furthermore, POM@MOF composites may act as highly active heterogeneous catalytic materials with excellent recyclability. Nevertheless, the experimental conditions for both the oxidation and extraction processes should be optimised in order to obtain performant systems.
For example, Hu et al. carried out a study in 2013 on the oxidation of benzothiophene (BT), dibenzothiophene (DBT) and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) (Scheme 4) – which are representative of the sulfur-containing heterocyclic compounds found in diesel oil – using PW12@MIL-101(Cr) (50 wt% in POM) with 30% H2O2 as an oxidant.45 Focusing on DBT, the conversion yield after 2 h at 45 °C was rather moderate (27%). When the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) phase transfer agent was added to the catalytic system, the conversion yield into sulfone reached 91%, showing that the surfactant played a crucial role in this reaction. Also, the H2O2/DBT ratio was identified as a key parameter, with the DBT removal approaching 95% for a ratio of 50 while being only 41% for a ratio of 12.5. This was related not only to the beneficial effect of the large excess of oxidant, but also to the formation of an optimised oil-in-water emulsion. We can also note that in the absence of PW12, MIL-101(Cr) converted DBT moderately (9%), evidencing that the POM acts as a catalyst. In addition, the recyclability and reusability of PW12@MIL-101(Cr) was demonstrated over four cycles, with the DBT conversion decreasing only from 91% to 87%.
 Scheme 4  Representations of benzothiophene (BT), dibenzothiophene (DBT) and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) and the related sulfones. 
Ribeiro et al. described an analogous catalytic system using the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIPF6) ionic liquid (IL) instead of CTAB.46 Considering the same substrates and working at 50 °C, the corresponding sulfones were quantitatively extracted (sulfur content = 500 ppm) into the IL within 1 h for DBT and 3 h for BT. The lowest reactivity of BT was attributed to the significantly lower electronic density on the sulfur atom, which decreased in the order DBT > 4,6-DMBT > BT. While a similar activity was found for the POM under homogeneous conditions, the advantage of the present system was its recyclability with only a moderate POM leaching after three cycles. In 2015, the same group reported the oxidation of the same substrates using the related PW11Zn@MIL-101(Cr)/BMIPF6 material, with similar results.39 However, a large loss of POM (50%) was observed after three cycles when the catalyst was used in the oil/BMIPF6 ODS system. Sun et al. built in 2018 a tricomponent material by dispersing PW12@MIL-101(Cr) into the mesoporous diatomite material.55 A comparison of the catalytic properties of PW12@MIL-101(Cr), PW12@diatomite and PW12@MIL-101(Cr)-diatomite hybrids showed that the latter was the most active composite for the oxidation of DTB with a yield of up to 98.5% (Fig. 34a) and only 1.5% conversion loss after three cycles, suggesting that diatomite may limit the leaching of POM.

MIL-101(Cr) incorporating a lanthanide substituted polyoxotungstate has also been considered for ODS. Ribeiro et al. immobilised the [Tb(PW11O39)2]11− sandwich-type POM into the MIL-101(Cr) matrix. The resulting composite Tb(PW11)2@MIL-101(Cr) showed good activity toward the oxidation of thiophene derivatives (H2O2, 50 °C).65 The influence of the solvent used for extraction was shown, wherein its polarity could be correlated with the sulfur extracting efficiency: while DMF showed the highest initial extraction capability, the best catalytic performance was achieved using less polar solvents, i.e. acetonitrile and isopropanol. This material was later compared to the trivacant polyoxotungstate-based PW9@MIL-101(Cr) composite, indicating a higher activity than Tb(PW11)2@MIL-101(Cr), with a complete desulfurisation achieved in 2 h instead of 5 h under analogous conditions.32 However, as suspected in the case of PW9@MIL-101(Cr) for the epoxidation of alkenes (see above), a chemical transformation of the encapsulated POM was not excluded, with an evolution of the desulfurisation profile being observed for the first 30 min from cycle 1 to cycle 3. Other lanthanide-containing POM@MOF systems were also studied, as exemplified by the investigation of the ODS activity of the closely related Eu(PW11)2@MIL-101(Cr) and Eu(PW11)2/NH2-MIL-53(Al) materials.66 The latter composite exhibited even better catalytic performances than Eu(PW11)2@MIL-101(Cr) for the ODS of a model diesel (initial sulfur content: ca. 2350 ppm), with 99.9% and 82.0% of desulfurisation (t = 2 h, T = 70 °C, acetonitrile), respectively. It must be underlined that the two materials presented very different structures. In Eu(PW11)2@MIL-101(Cr), the POMs were located inside the large cavities of the MOF. In contrast, it was proposed that the Eu(PW11)2 molecules (ca. 10 × 18 Å) were deposited on the surfaces of the MOF particles as they are too large for entering NH2-MIL-53(Al)'s channels (ca. 7.5 Å). The authors thus attributed the higher activity of the aluminum composite to the easier access of the substrate to the catalyst. We can note that in Eu(PW11)2/NH2-MIL-53(Al) the highly negatively charged POMs strongly interacted with the protonated amino groups of the MOF, ensuring relatively good stability of the POM/MOF composite although the POMs were not incorporated into the MOF's pores. However, some decrease of the Eu(PW11)2/NH2-MIL-53(Al) activity was observed over cycling, which could be attributed to significant POM leaching (W/Al (wt%) ratios of 0.57 and 0.41 before and after catalysis, respectively).
The zinc polyoxometalate [PW11Zn(H2O)O39]5− was introduced into the cavities of the NH2-MIL-101(Al).72 Again a partial transformation of NH2-MIL-101(Al) into NH2-MIL-53(Al) was observed, whatever the synthetic method used (impregnation or synthetic encapsulation). The POM-free MOF did not show any significant catalytic activity. Using the material obtained following the one-step synthetic procedure and the [BMIM]PF6 ionic liquid (IL), a sulfur removal of 83% was achieved after 6 h (T = 50 °C) working on a real diesel. This is a higher yield than that obtained under homogeneous conditions, which is explained by the intrinsic better performance of the composite when compared to that of the POM alone, together with the IL used during the oxidative catalytic stage and an optimised liquid–liquid extraction procedure.
The related chromium NH2-MIL-101(Cr) MOF has also been used for POM encapsulation for catalytic ODS reactions. Cao et al. reported in 2014 the incorporation of PW12via an ion exchange procedure, with a 0.126 mmol g−1 POM loading.70 The material was tested in model oil for the oxidation of DBT to its corresponding sulfone DBTO2 using H2O2 as an oxidant. Many parameters were explored including the solvent efficiency for the DBT extraction, the oxidant/substrate (O/S) molar ratio and the temperature. As expected, DMF showed a better extraction efficiency at 10 min (87%) when compared to MeCN (57%) because of its higher polarity. The conversion yield increased from RT to 50 °C, which was attributed to the increasing formation of metallic peroxide with temperature, while higher temperatures lead to the decomposition of H2O2 (Fig. 34b). An optimal O/S molar ratio is highly linked to the nature of the solvent. The best conversion rate with DMF was reached with an O/S ratio of 100 compared to 4 with MeCN. The optimal conditions were thus defined with MeCN, 50 °C and O/S = 4, reaching 99% DBT oxidation after 1 h. The recyclability of the PW12@NH2-MIL-101(Cr) composite was checked, with the conversion rate being maintained even after 6 runs. Finally, the authors tested the composite with 4,6-DMDBT and BT, leading to 88.2% and 70.5% conversion rates, respectively. The reactivity difference was again assigned to the difference in electron density on the sulfur atoms. More recently, Balula et al. studied the PMo12@NH2-MIL-101(Cr) composite,71 wherein experiments were conducted on a multi-component model oil containing BT, DBT, 4-MDBT and 4,6-DMDBT dissolved in n-octane (total sulfur concentration: 2000 ppm). After addition of H2O2, PMo12@NH2-MIL-101(Cr) exhibited a conversion yield of ca. 85% after 40 min and 95% after 2 h. These conversion yields are comparable to those obtained for the PMo12@HKUST-1 system studied by Rafiee et al.,127 with the copper system requiring, however, a higher temperature and O/S ratio than the chromium one. Lastly, the authors worked on real oil desulfurisation with 2300 ppm sulfur in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of MeCN:diesel at 50 °C, leading to a 69% conversion rate.71
The immobilisation of POMs into the iron-based MOF MIL-100(Fe) was also considered for similar catalytic purposes. Wang et al. reported in 2017 the use of a PW12@MIL-100(Fe) composite for ODS.80 By optimising the amount of incorporated POMs, the catalytic activity of 16 wt%PW12@MIL-100(Fe) for the oxidation of DBT was found to be twice as good as that of 7 wt%PW12@MIL-100(Fe) (conversion of 70% and 35%, respectively, after 1 h, 80 °C, H2O2/DBT = 2). This was explained considering that the higher loading of PW12 in the first composite provided more active sites. However, a further increase in the POM loading up to 35 wt% led to a decrease in the conversion of the substrate down to 28%. This trend was assigned to the partial blocking of the pores when large amounts of POMs were immobilised into the MOF. This also illustrates the importance of the balance between the number of active sites and the ability of the substrate to diffuse. Also, due to the decomposition of H2O2 at high temperatures, it was shown that the ODS conversion increased with temperature only up to 70 °C. The yield was also dependent on the oxidant/substrate (O/S) ratio which was also optimized. Hence, a full conversion was obtained with the 16%PW12@MIL-100(Fe) catalyst, working at 70 °C and with a O/S ratio of 4 after 1 h of reaction. The authors also investigated the encapsulation of PW12 in the UiO-66 zirconium MOF and the Zn-based ZIF-8 MOF in the same paper.80 While the activities of PW12@MIL-100(Fe) and PW12@UiO-66 were similar for the oxidation of DBT, PW12@MIL-100(Fe) exhibited much higher activities than PW12@UiO-66 for the oxidation of 4,6-DMDBT (93 and 39%, respectively; see Fig. 34c). This was surprising since control experiments showed that the POM-free MIL-100(Fe) was not active for ODS, while the POM-free UiO-66 could act as a catalyst due to the formation of active ZrIV-peroxo species in the presence of H2O2.255 These results could be explained considering the larger size of 4,6-DMDBT than that of DBT and the larger windows of MIL-100(Fe) when compared to those of UiO-66. In the case of PW12@UiO-66, only the POMs deposited at the surface of the material acted as molecular catalysts. All of this was also consistent with PW12@MIL-100(Fe) being less active than PW12@UiO-66 for the oxidation of the small BT substrate, which may enter the UiO-66's cavities. The low activity of PW12@ZIF-8 was also ascribed to the very narrow windows of the MOF host. Finally, the recyclability of PW12@MIL-100(Fe) was demonstrated over five cycles.
The UiO-67 Zr-MOF was also considered for encapsulating the PW12 polyanion for ODS applications.102 Under comparable conditions (however with an O/S ratio of 4 for PW12@UiO-66 and 13 for PW12@UiO-67), PW12@UiO-67 was much more efficient for the oxidation of 4,6-DMDBT (80%) than PW12@UiO-66 (39%).80 Although a larger amount of oxidant was considered with PW12@UiO-67, this trend confirms that the windows’ size (ca. 6.0 Å ∅ for UiO-66 and 8.0 Å ∅ for UiO-67) plays a key role in the oxidation performances of such large size substrates. The size-matched UiO-67 successfully prevents the leaching of POMs while allowing the accessibility of 4,6-DMDBT (Fig. 34d).102
Zhang et al. combined in 2019 the phosphomolybdic acid H3PMoVI12O40 and UiO-66, leading to the PMo12@UiO-66 composite.96 The material was further activated at temperatures ranging from T = 100 to 500 °C, affording PMo12@UiO-66-T catalysts where the POM was in a MoV/MoVI mixed-valent reduced form. The highest MoV/MoVI ratio was reached after calcination at 200 °C, with the formation of [PMoV4MoVI8O40]7− blue-colored four-electron reduced species. Supported by an XPS analysis, the reduction of the initially fully oxidised [PMoVI12O40]3− was associated with the formation of oxygen vacancies in the MOF with electrons transferred to the POM via the zirconium centres. Catalytic experiments were performed at 80 °C with the activated composites in a 500 ppm simulated oil obtained by dissolving DBT in decalin (TBHP as an oxidant and an O/S ratio of 3). The best activity was found for the PMo12@UiO-66-200 compound with a 100% DBT conversion obtained after 55 min (Fig. 35). The high ODS performance of this material compared to that of calcined composites in the 300–500 °C range was attributed to its highest MoV/MoVI ratio, whereby MoV centres efficiently reacted with TBHP to form the HO˙ reactive species involved in the proposed ODS mechanism. The collapse of the framework at high temperatures in POM/UiO-66-T composites resulted in the loss of surface area and pore volume, causing a decrease of ODS performance. The crucial role of the HO˙ radical in the catalytic cycle was strongly supported by control experiments performed in the presence of a radical scavenger, with the ODS activity decreasing completely when DMSO was added to the reacting medium.

MOF-808X (X = propionate, P; acetate, A; formate, F) was also considered for the encapsulation of POMs for ODS purposes. This family of Zr-MOFs possesses large cavities, the size of which can be controlled by tuning the nature of the carboxylates X connected to the metal centres in the [Zr6O4(μ3-OH)4(X)6(BTC)2] oxoclusters. First, Lin et al. prepared PW12@MOF-808X (X: P, A or F) materials with the POM loading varying from ca. 5 to 45% in weight.115 For PW12@MOF-808F and PW12@MOF-808A that possess large pore windows compared to the size of DBT, the oxidation of DBT was found to continuously increase with POM loading, with the concentration of active POM sites being the decisive factor for these catalytic systems. For PW12@MOF-808P that possesses pore window sizes close to that of DBT, the catalytic activity is reported to first increase and then decrease with POM loading, with a maximal conversion obtained for 21%PW12@MOF-808P. Hence, a large number of POMs could significantly slow down the mass transfer of DBT and its oxidative products in this framework. Overall, 42%PW12@MOF-808A exhibited the highest catalytic activity for DBT ODS. Also the PW12@MOF-808A material presented a higher crystallinity than the PW12@MOF-808F one, which could explain its higher activity. After optimisation of the catalytic parameters (O/S = 5, T = 60 °C), 42%PW12@MOF-808A fully oxidised DBT after only 30 min for an initial sulfur content of 1000 ppm. Interestingly, the authors showed that 42%PW12@MOF-808A was more active than PW12@UiO-67, PW12@MIL-101(Fe) and PW12@NH2-MIL-53(Al). Furthermore, control experiments evidenced that the oxidative activity of 42%PW12@MOF-808A was higher than that of MOF-808A or PW12 alone or that of their physical mixture. This could be assigned to the uniform dispersion of PW12 into the MOF and to the enrichment of the DBT and H2O2 concentrations into the pores. Alternatively, a synergistic effect of the MOF-808A host and the encapsulated POMs was claimed whereby the activation of both W and Zr centres in the presence of oxygen peroxide could also explain these results. The recyclability of this system was demonstrated over five cycles.
As previously mentioned, Rafiee et al. considered POM@HKUST-1 systems with three different Keggin-type POMs, namely, H3PW12O40, H3PMo12O40 and H3SiW12O40, for methyl phenyl sulfide (MPS) oxidation.127 They showed promising preliminary results with conversion yields after 80 min of ca. 95% for PMo12@HKUST-1, 90% for PW12@HKUST-1 and SiW12@HKUST-1. PMo12@HKUST-1 was selected to optimise the catalytic conditions, reaching 100% selectivity for MPSO2 (0.02 g POM@MOF, H2O2/MPS = 4, 45 °C). The oxidation of DBT was also investigated, leading to 100% selectivity for DBTO (H2O2/DBT = 4, 35 °C). Increasing the H2O2/DBT ratio and the temperature led to the quantitative formation of DBTO2 (65 °C, H2O2/DBT = 6).
Liu et al. investigated the encapsulation of PMo10V2 in the Cu-BTC MOF (NENU-9 composite).132 Nanocrystals of this material (NENU-9N) were considered, since large size crystals showed limited dispersion in diesel oil together with poor DTB uptakes. The catalytic activities for the oxidation of DBT to DBTO2 of the free POM, NENU-9 composite and NENU-9N nanocomposite were compared (0.01 mmol of catalyst 0.8 mmol of DBT, 8 mmol of isobutyraldehyde in 50 mL of decalin at 80 °C). The PMo10V2 alone showed poor activity with only 2% conversion after 2 h. The yield increased up to 41% once it was immobilised into Cu-BTC due to improved substrate–catalyst interactions within the porous matrix. Still, NENU-9N achieved 100% conversion after 2 h as a result of the shortened diffusion path. Leaching and recyclability tests were conducted, showing the system integrity after five catalytic cycles.
In 2020, Wei et al. considered a series of composites based on the Cu-MOF, rht-MOF-1, also incorporating vanadium substituted phosphomolybdates.137 PMo11V@rht-MOF-1, PMo10V2@rht-MOF-1 and PMo9V3@rht-MOF-1 with POM loadings of ca. 27 wt% were prepared. The catalytic activities of the three materials were compared to the related POMs under homogeneous conditions, showing similar results for BT conversion in the 68–72% range (T = 70 °C, O/S = 12, 50 min). Similar results were also observed for DBT and 4,6-DMDBT. The authors attributed the slight increase in conversion from PMo11V to PMo9V3 species to the increase of reactive oxygen associated with Mo–O–V groups. They also proposed that the substitution of molybdenum with vanadium could turn the acid dominant properties of these species into redox-dominant properties, favouring the oxidation process. In terms of recyclability, the three heterogeneous catalysts displayed a slight decrease in activity after the fourth run, which was attributed to the accumulation of sulfone into the pores.
5.1.7.2 Other oxidation reactions of sulfides. 
The aliphatic sulfide family includes particularly toxic compounds, such as 1-chloro-2-[(2-chloroethyl)sulfanyl]ethane mustard gas. Fortunately, their activity may decrease upon oxidation to form sulfoxides. Sulfoxides along with sulfones are useful synthetic intermediates for the elaboration of various biologically active molecules such as anti-bacterial, anti-atherosclerotic and anti-ulcer compounds. While various synthetic methods have been developed for the controlled oxidation of such sulfides, they often use toxic oxidants while leading to toxic waste. Various systems ranging from metal catalysts to enzymes have been used with H2O2 as an oxidant.256 Among them, polyoxometalates have attracted attention not only for this reaction due to their redox and acidic properties, but also for their low environmental impact257–259 with recent interest in POM@MOF composites as particularly appealing candidates.
In 2011, Song et al. studied the encapsulation of the copper-based Keggin-type [PW11CuO39]5− in the copper-MOF HKUST-1 for mercaptans and hydrogen sulfide oxidation.119 PW11Cu@HKUST-1 was found to oxidise H2S into S8, with a TON of 4300 in aqueous solution (pH 4.8) after 20 h under ambient conditions. No formation of S8 was observed in the presence of the sole [PW11CuO39]5− or HKUST-1. Strikingly, the immobilisation of the POM into the MOF pores was found to greatly stabilise the host, as the POM-free HKUST-1 material dissolved within minutes in the pH 4.8 reaction solution. A synergetic effect between the POM and the MOF was also reported in the gas phase. In this case, a low TON of 12 compared to that obtained in aqueous solution was attributed to the clogging of the pores by the oxidation products under such conditions. Control experiments considering the copper-free POM composite, PW12@HKUST-1, revealed that the presence of the copper centre in the POM was crucial, suggesting that the 3d centre was the active site for H2S oxidation. Also, mercaptan oxidation studies performed in chlorobenzene solutions evidenced the high catalytic activity of PW11Cu@HKUST-1 for degradation of thiols. A 99% chemo-selective oxidation was found for all the studied substrates. For instance, propanethiol was oxidised into di-n-propyl disulfide selectively, with a TON of 200 (O2, 50 °C, chlorobenzene). Again, the synergetic effect of the components was demonstrated. Just like ODS studies, steric effects affecting the oxidation process were reported, with the conversion yields decreasing with an increase in the number of mercaptan carbon atoms (95% and 32% for 2-hydroxyethanethiol and 1-butanethiol, respectively). The integrity of the composite after the catalytic process was checked by FT-IR and PXRD analysis, supporting the robust recyclability of the material.
Farha and co-workers reported the oxidation of 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES) – an analogue of the lethal chemical warfare agent mustard gas – to 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) and 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfone (CEESO2) using the PW12@NU-1000 catalyst (Fig. 36a).110 It must be noted that while CEESO is considered as non-toxic, this is not the case for the sulfone. Therefore, selectivity is an important issue in this kind of reaction. The composite was activated at 120 °C prior its characterization. It was shown that the POMs are located in the 12 Å channels, with the POM-free 31 Å channels being available for substrate diffusion. In this material, both the PW12 and the NU-1000 components acted as catalysts (MeCN, H2O2, 45 °C). Furthermore, the authors evidenced that the PW12@NU-1000-120 °C composite exhibited a higher activity than its individual components, showing a faster initial rate and a higher conversion than the POM or MOF alone (normalising to the sum of the POM and Zr6 nodes; see Fig. 36b).111 PXRD, DRIFTS and 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy experiments showed the integrity of the material after the catalytic event. Interestingly, when PW12@NU-1000 was activated under supercritical CO2 drying, the POMs were located in the 31 Å channels and not in the 12 Å ones as observed for PW12@NU-1000-120 °C.111 It was found that the TOF of PW12@NU-1000-scCO2 was ca. 3 times higher than that of PW12@NU-1000-120 °C, with a sulfoxide selectivity of 90% and 59%, respectively. We can note here that while the POM preferentially oxidised the substrate into sulfoxide, the MOF preferentially oxidised it into sulfone. It was thus proposed that the intermediate selectivity of PW12@NU-1000-120 °C indicated that both the MOF's and POM's active sites were accessible, while the exclusive formation of sulfoxide in PW12@NU-1000-scCO2 indicated that the sulfide readily reacted with PW12 accessible in the mesoporous channels.

(b) Conversion profiles using the catalysts NU-1000 (black), H3PW12O40 (green), PW12@NU-1000-120 °C (blue) and PW12@NU-1000-scCO2 (red). Adapted with permission from ref. 110 and 111.

Farha and coworkers also investigated the encapsulation of PW12 in the related naphthalene dicarboxylate (NDC) modified NU-1000 MOF (NU-1000-NDC) and in the NU-1008 MOF (with NU-1008 being a Zr-based MOF with 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)-3,6-dibromobenzene linkers) for the same reaction.114 PW12@NU-1000-NDC followed the same catalytic trend as PW12@NU-1000, with the supercritical CO2 dried sample going to full conversion at the highest rate, while the 120 °C activated sample exhibited a lower activity. Interestingly, the trend was reversed for PW12@NU-1008, with PW12@NU-1008-120 °C being more active than the scCO2 analogue. This could be linked to the fact that for this MOF the POMs remained in the mesopores after heating; in this case, heating the sample to remove water yielded the more active catalyst.
Li et al. studied in 2018 the incorporation of H5PMo10V2O40 in MIL-101(Cr) for the oxidation of sulfur mustard.68 The catalytic reaction was carried out with the POM-free MIL-101(Cr) (20 mg) at ambient temperature with 4 μL of sulfur mustard in 40 μL of petroleum ether, with ca. 90% decontamination after 2 h. Materials with different POM loadings were then tested, whereby the higher the POM loading, the better the decontamination yield, with more than 97% decontamination when using 33.7 wt%PMo10V2@MIL-101(Cr). GC-MS experiments performed with the CEES analogue suggested that the MOF just adsorbed the substrate, while the PMo10V2@MIL-101(Cr) material decontaminated CEES by a synergetic combination of adsorption by the MOF and oxidation by the POM. Finally, the recyclability of both MIL-101(Cr) and POM@MIL-101(Cr) was assessed, showing a negligible decrease in the activity over four runs.
Buru et al. compared PMo12@NU-1000 and PMo10V2@NU-1000 for CEES oxidation.113 As previously observed for PW12@NU-1000, characterisation of the PMo10V2@NU-1000 composite after supercritical CO2 treatment revealed that the POMs are located in the mesopores, while heating the material moved the POM from the mesopores to the micropores. CEES oxidation was performed in the dark under aerobic conditions in cyclohexane at 70 °C with isobutyraldehyde as the sacrificial reductant. The reaction of PMoVI10VV2O40 with dioxygen occurred at the vanadium centres and required its reduction to PMoVI10VIVVVO40. This was supported considering that a full CEES conversion was reached with the PMo10V2@NU-1000 catalyst after 30 min, while only 5% CEES conversion was obtained with PMo12@NU-1000 under the same conditions. However, the CEES oxidation did not lead to the CEESO sulfoxide but mainly to the toxic CEESO2 sulfone. Importantly, while the PMo10V2@NU-1000 composite could be recycled, achieving full conversion, the pure PMo10V2 POM decomposed under analogous conditions, providing evidence of the superiority of the composite material.
Zhao et al. prepared PMo11V@rho-ZIF, PMo10V2@rho-ZIF and PMo9V3@rho-ZIF Zn-based composites for thioether catalytic oxidation.141 The catalytic properties and selectivity of the POM and POM@MOF composites were compared for thioanisole oxidation (0.25 mmol thianisole, 0.45 μmol catalyst, 0.3 mmol H2O2 in 2 mL of methanol). The POMs displayed great activities (ca. 97% conversion) but lacked selectivity to sulfoxide (85%, 59% and 51% for PMo11V, PMo10V2 and PMo9V3, respectively). The POM@MOF systems exhibited high activities as well, along with higher selectivity to sulfoxide, ranging from 93 to 97%. The POM-free rho-ZIF MOF showed only a low conversion yield (22%). The catalytic conditions were optimised with the PMo11V@rho-ZIF catalyst considering various solvents, oxidant concentrations and reaction times. The nature of the solvent did not affect the conversion yield but greatly impacted the selectivity. Illustratively, 99% selectivity over sulfoxide (99% conversion) was reached in methanol after 12 h reaction. The oxidation of various thioethers was studied with PMo11V@rho-ZIF as a catalyst. In all cases, good activities and selectivities were observed. However, we can notice that the bigger the substrate, the lower the activity, with only 82.7% of conversion for diphenyl sulfide (Fig. 37). Finally, these systems were recycled at least four times without significant loss of activity, even if a slight decrease in the selectivity was observed after the third run.

Naseri et al. prepared a series of composites by immobilising sandwich-type Keggin anions, namely [(HOSnIVOH)3(XW9O34)2]n− (X = P, n = 12; X = Si, n = 14), [(OCeIV)3(PW9O34)2]12− and [WM3(H2O)2(MW9O34)2]12− (M = CoII, ZnII), into MIL-101(Cr) for the oxidation of diphenylsulfide at room temperature with H2O2 as an oxidant.61 While the considered POMs showed almost no activity under homogeneous conditions, the POM-free MIL-101(Cr) displayed some activity, yet far smaller than that of the POM@MIL-101(Cr) materials. Noticeably, P2W18Sn3@MIL-101(Cr) and P2W18Ce3@MIL-101(Cr) exhibited the highest oxidising activity, with a conversion of 98% in sulfone (in acetonitrile) in 120 and 35 min, respectively. The reaction could be performed in water, however with longer reaction times (210 min for P2W18Sn3@MIL-101(Cr), conversion of 98% in sulfone). In addition, the reaction was sped up by heating at 60 °C. As mentioned above, further heating slowed the reaction due to the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. For both P2W18Sn3@MIL-101(Cr) and P2W18Ce3@MIL-101(Cr), the study was extended to a whole series of organosulfides, providing in each case high conversions and selectivities. Finally, the reusability of the systems was studied, showing only a slight decrease of the yield after 6 cycles (90% for P2W18Ce3@MIL-101(Cr) and 80% for P2W18Sn3@MIL-101(Cr)).


5.1.8 Reduction reactions. 
Very few studies have been dedicated to reduction reactions catalysed by POM@MOF materials, and most of them are performed under photocatalytic conditions (see below). We can, however, note that Shah et al. encapsulated the [PMo11MnII(H2O)O39]5− manganophosphomolybdate in MIL-100(Fe) for the reduction of p-nitrophenol into p-aminophenol in the presence of NaBH4.86 The reaction was followed by UV-vis spectroscopy, showing that 96% of p-nitrophenol was reduced after 25 min in the presence of the PMo11Mn@MIL-101(Fe) composite (water, 20 °C). No conversion was observed without the addition of the catalyst after a period of 2 h. Also, both the POM and the MOF taken separately were found to be inactive. On a mechanistic point of view, it was proposed that the electron transfer took place from BH4− to the POM, followed by an electron transfer to the Fe3+ Lewis acidic centres of the MOF and the reduction of the substrate in a final step. Still, improvements are needed in order to have POM@MOF composites that compete with the best catalysts reported so far such as noble-metal incorporating Pd@MIL-100 or Pt/MoS2 NS (NS = nanosheets) materials.86

5.2. Acid and base catalysis

5.2.1 Acid catalysis. 
Polyoxometalates in their protonated forms possess a superacidic behavior.260 Their molar catalytic activity in organic media can be 100–1000 times higher than that of H2SO4. Furthermore, they resist to oxidative degradation. They can exhibit both Brønsted and/or Lewis acidic catalytic properties, depending on their chemical composition.261 These features explain why a very large number of POM@MOF systems have been designed for heterogeneous acid catalysis applications. Above all, materials based on the incorporation of H3PW12 POMs into MOFs have been widely considered. Polyoxotungstates – and especially phosphotungstic acid – represent indeed candidates of choice for acid catalysis because of their strong acidity and high stability when compared to polyoxomolybdates.262
In 2010, Juan-Alcañiz et al. studied the esterification of n-butanol with acetic acid in the presence of such POM@MIL-101(Cr) catalysts.41 The TON (3000) and TOF (11 h−1) values were calculated at T = 110 °C for the 20 wt%PW12,{PW11Cr}@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst prepared by synthetic encapsulation. These values were higher than those previously reported in the literature for POMs immobilised onto mesoporous supports under similar reaction conditions.263 Interestingly, no significant activity was found when using the related composite prepared by impregnation. The latter case was interpreted considering stronger POM–MOF interactions, whereby the acidity of the POM is reduced. Alternatively, this could be attributed to the different natures of the POMs in the composite (i.e. different PW12/PW11Cr ratios, with the last species being formed in a larger amount when the composite was prepared in one-step). The acid catalysis activity of the material prepared in one-step was also evidenced via the study of the dehydration of methanol to dimethyl ether in the gas phase.
The dehydration of carbohydrates was also considered. Zhang et al. showed that the one-step prepared 33.8 wt%PW12@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst allowed forming 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from fructose with a 63% yield and a 77% selectivity (130 °C, 30 min, DMSO) (Fig. 38).42 By contrast, the POM-free MIL-101(Cr) framework did not show any significant activity despite the presence of chromium Lewis acid centres, corroborating that the catalytic activity of the composite was due to the Brønsted acidity of the encapsulated phosphotungstic acid. ICP measurements indicated that only a few tungsten (0.2%) and chromium (0.4%) species leached out from the 33.8 wt%PW12@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst upon the first reaction cycle. The 5-hydroxymethylfurfural yield and selectivity decreased somewhat in the consecutive runs (47% yield and 58% selectivity after the third run).

Bromberg et al. proposed the use of PW12@MIL-101(Cr) for the Baeyer condensation of volatile aldehydes.43 The targeted reactions are the acetaldehyde phenol and benzaldehyde methanol condensations known to be catalysed by strong acids under homogeneous conditions. Materials were synthesised via two methods, i.e. encapsulation synthesis and post-synthetic impregnation. Both methods led to similar 31 wt%PW12@MIL-101(Cr) materials. In an acetaldehyde vapour-saturated desiccator, uptake of acetaldehyde with the PW12-doped materials was more than 4 times higher than that with the POM-free MOF. After two days at room temperature 97% of the acetaldehyde was converted. With the same catalysts, the exothermic acetaldehyde phenol condensation was conducted at room temperature and studied by 1H NMR. Deuterated tetrahydrofuran was used both as solvent and an NMR lock. A conversion of 50% of the initial acetaldehyde was reached after 30 min, with a complete conversion within 5 days. Finally, benzaldehyde acetalisation was studied, showing a 95% conversion within 24 h with the POM@MOF composite, while the POM-free MIL-101(Cr) material led to 80% conversion within the same span of time. In both studied reactions, the PW12@MIL-101(Cr) composite was shown to be more efficient than the POM-free material. Elemental analysis evidenced a leaching of 3–5 wt% of PW12 after 4 catalytic cycles for the acetaldehyde phenol condensation.
Khder et al. synthesised PW12@MIL-101(Cr) materials with high POM loadings (50–70–90 wt%) via post-synthetic impregnation.47 The surface acidity sampled by potentiometric titration increased with the POM loading in 50 wt% and 70 wt%PW12@MIL-101(Cr) samples, but decreased in 90 wt%PW12@MIL-101(Cr), allegedly due to the aggregation of PW12 crystals on the MIL-101(Cr) surface in the last case. Also, in contrast to 90 wt%PW12@MIL-101(Cr), the 50 wt%PW12@MIL-101(Cr) and 70 wt%PW12@MIL-101(Cr) composites remained highly porous, with a good dispersion of the POM into the MOF. These materials were studied as catalysts for three targeted solvent-free reactions, i.e. Pechmann reaction, esterification reaction and Friedel–Crafts acylation reaction. In the three cases, the reactants were magnetically stirred and heated at 120 °C before addition of 0.05 g of catalyst. The reactions were conducted for 1 h before filtration and analysis of the products by GC-MS. While the POM-free MOF showed little catalytic activity, 70 wt%PW12@MIL-101(Cr) possessed the best POM loading for the three reactions. The authors evidenced that even at such high loading the POMs were well dispersed in the MOF. In the case of the Pechmann and Friedel–Crafts reactions, no significant decrease in the activity for the selected 70 wt%PW12@MIL-101(Cr) was observed after four consecutive runs. For esterification, the yield decreased from 92.3% to 80.1% after four runs.
To overcome selectivity issues in the self-condensation of cyclic ketones, Deng et al. proposed the use of PW12@MIL-101(Cr) and PW12@MIL-100(M) (M = Cr, Fe) as catalysts with variable amounts of PW12.48 The authors showed that the optimal amount of PW12 (ranging from 0 wt% to 42.7 wt% inside MIL-101(Cr)) decreased as the size of the reactants increased, showing a correlation between the size of the pores and the selectivity. For the self-condensation of cyclopentanone, the targeted 2-cyclopentylidenecyclopentanone product was obtained with a selectivity of >98% when using 42.7 wt%PW12@MIL-101(Cr) (130 °C, 48 h, no solvent, N2 atmosphere) (Fig. 39). For comparison, the POM-free MIL-101(Cr) exhibited a selectivity of 20%. In addition, the authors showed that the POM-free MIL-100(M) and PW12@MIL-100(M) synthesised using Fe and Cr ions show very similar conversions and selectivities, indicating that the catalytic activity is driven by the MOF cage size and the acidity of the POM rather than by the nature of the M centres. Upon recovery of the catalyst, there was a negligible amount of POM leaching (7.4 × 10−4 g per gram of catalyst). Five consecutive runs for the cyclopentanone self-condensation did not affect the performances of the 42.7 wt%PW12@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst, keeping its selectivity above 98%.

The hydroxyalkylation of phenol with formaldehyde into bisphenol F using PW12@MIL materials was investigated.49 First, it was shown that the POM-free MIL-100(M) and MIL-101(M) (M = Cr, Fe) materials did not have any significant activity for such a reaction. The POM@MIL materials were then prepared, and the amount of incorporated PW12 optimised for catalytic purposes. 18 wt%PW12@MIL-100(Fe) was found to be the most active composite, with a bisphenol F (BPF) yield of 71% after 1 h (95% selectivity) and an isomer distribution of 18, 51 and 31 for the 4,4′-, 2,4′- and 2,2′-isomers, respectively (80 °C, phenol:formaldehyde molar ratio 30:1). The yield was further increased after 8 h (92%), with only a slight decrease in the selectivity (93%). A mechanistic pathway was proposed (Fig. 40). First, a hydroxymethyl carbocation is formed by protonation of the formaldehyde by the POM, with the release of a water molecule. Second, the carbocation attacks a carbon of the phenol to form a new resonance-stabilised carbocation. Third, the p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol is formed after a proton transfer to the catalyst. Fourth, the hydroxymethyl abstracts a proton from the POM to form the hydroxybenzyl carbocation. Finally, this carbocation attacks a carbon of a second phenol, forming the bisphenol F product, with a regeneration of the catalyst.49 Interestingly, the nature of the metal structuring the framework was shown to play here a crucial role in the distribution of isomers, with the Fe- and Cr-based MOFs favouring the formation of the 2,4′- and 4,4′-isomers, respectively. The recyclability was tested over six runs, showing a decrease of the yield from 71 to 53% (1 h reaction).

The Biginelli condensation reaction (Scheme 5) between benzaldehyde (1 mmol), ethylacetoacetate (1 mmol) and urea (1.5 mmol) was carried out using PW12@MIL-101(Cr) materials prepared via the impregnation method.50 Under solvent free conditions at 100 °C, the 10 wt%PW12@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst afforded the desired product with a yield based on benzaldehyde of 90% after 1 h. The study was extended to fourteen different substituted aromatic aldehydes with electron withdrawing or releasing substituents on the phenyl ring, showing that the catalyst was efficient for the whole series with yields ranging from 75 to 85% (t = 1–3 h). It was proposed that the reaction first proceeded by the formation of the imine from aldehyde and urea, followed by the addition of the enol tautomer of the 1,3-dicarbonyl compound to the imine. In the final step, the cyclodehydration of the ureide affords the corresponding dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-one. The PW12@MIL-101(Cr) catalyst acted as a proton source, allowing the enolization of the 1,3-dicarbonyl compound and dehydrating the ureide.

The 32 wt%PW12@NH2-MIL-101(Al) and 29 wt%PW12@NH2-MIL-53(Al) materials prepared by impregnation of the amino-MOFs were considered for acid catalysis.76 Interestingly, it was shown that the equilibrium uptake of acetaldehyde from its saturated vapour phase was much higher for the POM-based composites than for the POM-free ones, with 600 and 50 wt% uptakes at 25 °C, respectively. Such exceptional acetaldehyde vapour uptake was attributed to vapour condensation and pore-filling. It was associated with the simultaneous conversion of acetaldehyde to much less volatile polymeric compounds resulting from repeated aldol condensation (Scheme 6), with the heteropolyacid acting as a catalyst. The activity of 32 wt%PW12@NH2-MIL-101(Al) in the liquid phase was also investigated. The composite catalysed the conversion of acetaldehyde into crotonaldehyde (25 °C, water/acetonitrile 30:70) through the Mannich pathway or via aldol condensation, with fast kinetics (t1/2 = 3.2 h, i.e. 5–10 fold shorter than those obtained in water catalysed by amino-acids or 80 wt% sulfuric acid). No significant loss of activity was observed after three runs.

The conversion of ethanol into ethylene and/or diethyl ether was investigated using PW12@BasoliteTMF-300 as a catalyst. The BasoliteTMF-300 commercial MOF studied by Micek-Ilnicka et al. possessed a structure analogous to MIL-100(Fe).78 The conversion yield increased with temperature and PW12 loading. Concerning the selectivity, diethyl ether was selectively formed in the 90–130 °C temperature range, while the selectivity to ethylene increased from 130 to 200 °C, reaching 90% at the highest temperature for 80 wt%PW12@BasoliteTMF-300 (Fig. 41). Interestingly, two maxima were found for the diethyl ether yield vs temperature curves for 50 wt%PW12@BasoliteTMF-300, at ca. 130 and 170 °C (Fig. 41). The location of the POM on the external or internal surfaces of the MOF may be responsible for the occurrence of these low and high temperature maxima, respectively. For the 80 wt%PW12@BasoliteTMF-300 sample, only one maximum was observed at ca. 130 °C, suggesting that – for this high POM-loading composite – mainly the POM located on the external surface of the MOF acted as a catalyst. This is consistent with the fact that the catalytic properties for 80 wt%PW12@BasoliteTMF-300 and the pure PW12 POM were comparable. No POM leaching experiment was, however, reported.

The one-pot prepared PW12@MIL-100(Fe) system was studied by Zhang et al. as an acid catalyst for esterification and acetalisation reactions in liquid solution.79 Esterification of n-hexanol with acetic acid afforded only n-hexyl acetate, with conversion yields of 96% (23 wt%PW12@MIL-100(Fe)), 78% (MIL-100(Fe)), 88% (PW12) and 89% (for a mixture of PW12 and MIL-100(Fe) (110 °C, 12 h)). The higher activity of 23 wt%PW12@MIL-100(Fe) was assigned to the accumulation of the reactants inside the MOF pores. The temperature was a crucial parameter: the conversion yield was only 50% at 70 °C considering 23 wt%PW12@MIL-100(Fe) as the catalyst. The reusability of the catalyst was demonstrated as the conversion yield remained constant after five cycles. The study was extended to other monohydric alcohols with different chain lengths. The formed ester yield decreased when the chain length increased, in agreement with an esterification reaction occurring within the MOF's pores. Benzaldehyde glycol acetal was obtained with conversion yields of 98% (23 wt%PW12@MIL-100(Fe)), 85% (MIL-100(Fe)), 92% (PW12) and 94% (for a mixture of PW12 and MIL-100(Fe) (80 °C, 120 min)), showing a slight beneficial effect of combining POMs and MOFs.
After selecting MIL-100(Fe) over HKUST-1 as the best material for immobilising the porcine pancreatic lipase, Nobakht et al. explored the use of PW12@MIL-100(Fe) as a support composite.81 The enzyme was post-synthetically immobilised onto both MIL-100(Fe) and PW12@MIL-100(Fe) for comparison. The authors showed not only that the immobilisation of the lipase improved its thermal, pH and operational stabilities but also that the addition of the POM increased its catalytic activity for the synthesis of benzyl cinnamate. After 5 successive catalytic cycles, the enzyme retained 90.4% of its initial activity.
Wan et al. explored the combination of PW12, MIL-100(Fe) and Ionic Liquids (ILs) for the esterification of oleic acid.82 The synthesis of PW12@MIL-100(Fe) was performed by synthetic encapsulation and was followed by the addition of sulfonic acid group-functionalised ILs via the anion-exchange method, with the final composite exhibiting both Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites. For the esterification of oleic acid with ethanol, these features allowed an excellent conversion yield (94.6%). The conversion yields determined with the MIL-100(Fe) (15.5%), PW12@MIL-100(Fe) (40.3%) and IL@MIL-100(Fe) (90.2%) catalysts provided evidence for the synergetic effect of the three-party POM–MOF–IL combination. The reusability of the catalyst was assessed, whereby it was still stable after 6 runs, showing no observable leaching of the encapsulated species, contrasting with the IL@MOF material which degraded. These results highlighted the stabilizing role of the POM, a feature we will encounter also later in this section.
Considering Zr-based MOFs, we can note that the acidolysis of soybean oil for the production of low-calorie structured lipids has been studied employing a material mixing the Cs2.5H0.5PW12 POM and the UiO-66 MOF.92 In the presence of this catalyst (150 °C, 10 h), the medium chain fatty acid content increased significantly in the acidolysis products, whereas the unsaturated fatty acid content was greatly reduced. The reusability of the catalyst was relatively good, with a slight decrease of the catalytic activity after five runs.
Zhang et al. encapsulated another Keggin POM, SiW12, inside UiO-66.94 This material was used as a solid acidic catalyst for lauric acid esterification with methanol. The first conversion results were 80.5% (160 °C, 1:20 lauric acid:methanol molar ratio, 7 wt% catalyst, 4 h). After optimisation using the Response Surface Methodology, the conversion rate reached a maximum of 92.8% (170 °C, 1:20 lauric acid:methanol molar ratio, 11 wt% catalyst, 5 h), competing with previously published heterogeneous catalysts.94 The importance of the polyanion was also demonstrated in the recyclability experiments. Indeed, after 6 runs the SiW12@UiO-66 composite material showed only a slight decrease of catalytic activity, while the POM-free MOF activity drastically decreased. The same authors explored another esterification reaction using a slightly modified catalyst. Instead of using SiW12, they studied the Zr-doped version of the polysilicotungstic acid encapsulated in UiO-66 or in Fe-BTC for comparison.95 After in situ synthesis of related ZrSiW@UiO-66 and ZrSiW@Fe-BTC nanomaterials, esterification of oleic acid with methanol was tested considering various parameters (oleic acid:methanol molar ratio, temperature, synthesis time, catalyst loading). The authors concluded about the superiority of ZrSiW@UiO-66 over the Fe-BTC counterpart, with optimised conditions for 1:20 oleic acid:methanol molar ratio, T = 150 °C, 4 h and 0.24 g of catalyst, reaching an optimal conversion rate of 98%. After 3 catalytic cycles, the conversion rate started to decrease to reach 89% after 6 runs. Xie et al. went one step further by introducing an additional sulfonic acid group-functionalised IL by post-synthetic anion exchange after the in situ synthesis of POM@UiO-66-2COOH (POM = PW12, SiW12, PMo12).99 As mentioned above, the combination of the three POM-MOF-IL components allowed excellent conversion rates for the targeted esterification and transesterification reactions. The conversion rates for soya bean oil esterification ranged from 92.8% to 95.2% for the POM@UiO-66-2COOH/IL (110 °C, 1:35 oil:methanol ratio, 6 h, 10 wt% catalyst), much above those of the POM@UiO-66-2COOH (23.6–30.1% conversion) or the POM-free MOF (8.4% conversion). Also, the authors correlated the increase in conversion with the increase of the POM acidity, notwithstanding the presence of IL. Finally, the stabilising role of POM was once again critical since the recyclability of the POM-free material decreased drastically after 5 runs (Fig. 42).

The Zr-based PW12@NU-1000 composite was prepared and used as a catalyst for the isomerisation/disproportionation of o-xylene (Scheme 7).112 Interestingly, the stability of the composite – which is of primary importance for its use under harsh conditions such as those considered for C–C skeletal rearrangement reactions – was highly dependent on the amount of POM incorporated into the MOF framework. A high PW12 loading (ca. one POM by a unit cell of NU-1000, corresponding to 45 wt%) was required, as materials with a lower loading lost their structural integrity under the catalytic conditions (250 °C). The highly stable 45 wt%PW12@NU-1000 catalyst was found to be active toward the transmethylation pathway, which requires two adjacent active sites in a confined pore, as created when POMs are confined in NU-1000 at such a high loading. Selectivities of 17% for the isomerisation process (m- and p-xylene) and 83% for the disproportionation process (toluene and trimethylbenzene) were determined (t = 240 min). In comparison, the WOx–ZrO2 (16.5 wt% W) material exhibited a 100% selectivity toward the isomerisation pathway under the same experimental conditions.

Concerning copper-containing matrices, Zhu et al. used POMs immobilised into HKUST-1 to selectively synthesise ester from glycerol (40 °C, H2O2, H2O).117 By varying the nature of the POM, they encapsulated via an in situ process H3PW12O40, H3PMo12O40, H4PVMo11O40, H5PV2Mo10O40 and H6PV3Mo9O40 inside HKUST-1. The best selectivity toward ester formation was obtained with the PW12@HKUST-1 catalyst (35%). The authors further selected this material to test its reusability, however showing a significant decrease in selectivity and conversion after 5 cycles. Sun et al. characterised the 47 wt%PW12@HKUST-1 material (NENU-3) and used it in ester hydrolysis reactions.121 This compound contained water molecules and tetramethyl ammonium cations which could be evacuated by a thermal treatment at 200 °C. This afforded the NENU-3a composite with three acidic protons per POM compared to one for NENU-3. The hydrolysis of ethyl acetate in an excess of water was performed at 60 °C. A conversion yield of 95% was observed for NENU-3a after 7 h, i.e. approximately four times the yield observed for NENU-3. It was also shown that the catalytic activity of NENU-3a after 2 h was 3 to 7 times higher than those of H2SO4, H3PW12O40, SO42−/ZrO2, Nafion-H, and Amberlyst-15. Substrates with increasing dimensions were also tested. In brief, while similar conversions of methyl acetate and ethyl acetate molecules were found with NENU-3a (ca. 64% after 5 h), the conversion of the bulky, aromatic ethyl benzoate (17% after 5 h) was much lower (Fig. 43). It was thus again proposed that the reactants with small sizes and high hydrophilicity quickly diffused through the pores, where the reaction took place, while substrates with larger sizes and higher hydrophobicity could adsorb onto the surfaces of the pores, slowing the conversion. The recyclability was shown over 15 cycles, with the solution becoming completely inactive upon removal of the catalyst, indicating that the process was genuinely heterogeneous.

Liu et al. proposed using the same catalyst, NENU-3a, for the esterification of acetic acid with various alcohols.128 Their final goal was biodiesel production with large fatty acids (lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid). NENU-3a was synthesised with two different crystal topologies: octahedral (o-NENU-3a) and cubic (c-NENU-3a). This feature changed drastically the catalytic performances. Indeed, c-NENU-3a displayed excellent conversion rates for the 14 studied reactions (83 ≤ yield < 99%), while the octahedral version was much less efficient (17 ≤ yield ≤ 90%). This behaviour was explained through the study of the surface topologies of the catalysts. By carefully examining the porous environment of the POM, the authors highlighted key differences between the cubic and octahedral morphologies: in the case of the octahedral shape, the distribution of the polyanion in the pores limited the contact between the reactants and the catalyst, while it was maximised in the case of the cubic particles.
In 2010 and 2011, Wee et al. published two joint studies concerning the catalytic activity of PW12@HKUST-1 nanocrystals for the esterification of acetic acid with 1-propanol.124,125 The authors showed not only that the POM@MOF material performed better than the classical Y zeolite for the same reaction, but also that the particle size was an important parameter. The major drawback observed was the lack of stability of the catalyst, which could even dissolve under certain reaction conditions (high acetic acid concentration). To address this problem, the authors optimised the reaction parameters to decrease the concentration of acetic acid. They finally showed an increase in the conversion rate between micron-sized composite particles (17% conversion after 7 h), 65 nm-sized particles (28% conversion after 7 h) and 50 nm-sized particles (30% conversion after 7 h) under the optimised conditions (60 °C, 1:40 acetic acid:1-propanol molar ratio, 2.3 wt% catalyst).
The related 54 wt%SiW12@HKUST-1 (NENU-1) was also synthesised with different particles sizes. Its activated form NENU-1a was studied for the dehydration of methanol to dimethyl ether in the gas phase.130 Methanol conversions with NENU-1a particles with average diameters of 23, 105, and 450 μm were 60%, 58%, and 46%, respectively, with selectivities up to 100% (240 °C, P = 6 bar). These values were much higher than that for the POM-free HKUST-1 MOF (ca. 9%), indicating the crucial role of the Brønsted acidic molecular catalyst. The material with the largest particle size exhibited the lowest catalytic activity, possibly due to internal diffusion limitations. We could, however, see that particles of 23 and 105 μm exhibited similar activities, showing that even relatively large particles were highly active. This was related to the small size of the substrate considered. Compared to γ-Al2O3-supported H4SiW12O40 catalysts, the studied POM@MOFs exhibited higher activity due to the higher accessibility of the active sites and to the much higher POM loading than the reported optimal loading of γ-Al2O3 (15 wt%). The PW12@HKUST-1 material was less active and selective than SiW12@HKUST-1, which could be attributed to the lower stabilisation of the framework and to the higher acidity of the PW12 POM. It was indeed underlined that, as dimethylether was an intermediate of methanol dehydration, in the presence of highly acidic catalysts the methanol tended to further dehydrate to form olefins or coke.
The same group described a related compound, NENU-11, a PW12-incorporating copper MOF, together with its thermally activated form, NENU-11a. The materials were tested for the decomposition of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), which is commonly used as a simulant for type-G and type-X toxic nerve agents.123 Firstly, it was shown that NENU-11a adsorbed a considerable amount of DMMP (up to 24 wt% after 100 min at room temperature and under 1 atm). The POM probably played a role in the uptake capacity of the material via the formation of hydrogen bonds with the substrate. Secondly, when NENU-11a with adsorbed DMMP was put in water, the methanol, methyl methylphosphonic acid and methylphosphonic acid products were formed (Scheme 8), with a conversion yield of DMMP of 34% at room temperature and 93% at 50 °C (8 h). The stability of the material was checked over more than 10 cycles.

The PMo12@HKUST-1 (NENU-5) composite was studied by Wang et al. in 2016 for converting 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) and ethyl levulinate (EL).135 Catalytic experiments unambiguously showed the activity of the POM@MOF with 100% conversion of HMF (43.7% yield for EMF; 7.6% for EL), while the POM-free material did not allow any conversion. Under homogeneous conditions, the POM exhibited similar catalytic performances to that under heterogeneous ones (100% conversion, 44.6% yield for EMF, 8.9% for EL). This material was thus a perfect example of the heterogenisation of a molecular catalyst with no significant loss of activity. Finally, the recyclability tests showed that the total yield was maintained over 5 cycles (ca. 50% in each run). Still, the EMF yield decreased by 6.5% between the first and fifth runs, while the EL yield increased by 4.4%.
It can be concluded from this section devoted to acid catalysis that Keggin-type polyoxometalates are almost exclusively used for acid catalysis application in MOFs. H3PW12O40 has been encapsulated in the major MOFs: MIL-101, UiO, HKUST, and NU-1000. The resulting hybrid was used for a variety of reactions often exhibiting better catalytic activity compared to the POM under homogeneous conditions or the POM-free MOF.


5.2.2 Base catalysis. 
Compared to acid catalysis, base catalysis involving polyoxometalates has been scarcely investigated even if several POM systems were recently reported to act as catalysts for base-catalysed reactions such as the cyanosilylation of carbonyl compounds or C–C bond formation reactions.264 We can mention here one study devoted to POM@MOF systems for such reactions. The very efficient Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with ethyl cyanoacetate with POM@MOF catalysts was investigated by Juan-Alcañiz et al.41 Considering the 10 wt%PW12,{PW11Cr}@MIL-101(Cr) composite prepared in one-step (see above), a TON of 216 after 20 min was reached (DMF, 40 °C), corresponding to a TOF > 656 h−1, highlighting the outstanding performance of this material. The catalyst was shown to be highly active in either polar or apolar solvents (TON = 195 and TOF > 591 h−1 in toluene). It was proposed that the catalytic mechanism (Fig. 44) is similar to that occurring with metallic complexes.265 Finally, the catalyst was proved reusable in the absence of leaching even after eight cycles.

5.3. Photo- and electrocatalytic reactions

5.3.1 Oxygen evolution reaction (OER). 
The generation of molecular oxygen driven by photocatalysis or electrolysis via the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a fundamental reaction for energy storage and conversion applications such as solar fuel production and metal–air batteries.266,267 Over the last ten years, POMs have been shown to be effective molecular catalysts for water oxidation. A remarkable discovery in this field was made by Yin et al., who reported in 2010 the visible light driven OER using the noble metal-free catalyst [Co4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2]10− (P2W18Co4) which exhibited at pH 8 a TON of 75 using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as a photosensitizer.268 The immobilisation of P2W18Co4 into a MOF was shown not only to allow a heterogenous POM system but also to optimise its catalytic activity. In 2016, Han et al. indeed studied photochemical and electrochemical water oxidation by P2W18Co4@MIL-101(Cr).63 The photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation of the POM@MOF material for water oxidation was performed at pH 8 using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as a photosensitiser and Na2S2O8 as a sacrificial electron acceptor (Fig. 45a). A TOF in the first 20 min of the reaction of 7.1 × 10−3 s−1 per cobalt atom of P2W18Co4@MIL-101(Cr) and an oxygen yield of 66% were determined. Under the same experimental conditions, a TOF of 4.0 × 10−3 s−1 per cobalt atom and an O2 yield of 49% were observed with an equivalent amount of free POM. Under electrocatalytic conditions, the P2W18Co4@MIL-101(Cr) material showed a lower overpotential and higher current density than P2W18Co4 (Fig. 45b).63 However, the composite suffered from POM leaching during catalysis. This issue could be addressed by using a MOF with lower pore windows than MIL-101(Cr). Two years later, Shah et al. thus reported on the incorporation of [CoIICoIIIW11O39(H2O)]7− (Co2W11) and P2W18Co4 into MIL-100(Fe), which possesses smaller windows than MIL-101(Cr).83 The photocatalytic experiments were performed under experimental conditions analogous to those considered by Han et al.63

On the one hand, the O2 yield of Co2W11@MIL-100(Fe) was higher than that of the bare POM (41% vs. 30%) in the first 10 min of illumination, and the TOF in the first two minutes increased from 0.48 s−1 for the bare POM up to 0.53 s−1 for the POM@MOF with a plateau reached after 7–8 min of illumination. On the other hand, the P2W18Co4@MIL-100(Fe) system (Fig. 45c) displayed an O2 yield and a TOF of 72% and 9.2 × 10−3 s−1, respectively. These values were higher than the TOF and O2 yield of the bare POM and slightly higher than the values reported for P2W18Co4@MIL-101(Cr).63 This enhanced activity of the POM@MOF composite was attributed to the proximity between the Lewis acidic Fe3 units of MIL-100 and the anionic POMs. The latter is claimed to facilitate electron transfer between the two components in which the LUMO of the POM accepted the photoinduced electrons from the conduction band of MIL-100(Fe). Furthermore, Co2W11@MIL-100(Fe) and Co4P2W18@MIL-100(Fe) composites also displayed a better electrochemical water oxidation activity than the bare POM, with a lower onset potential and a higher current density. Importantly, no leaching was observed during the catalytic reactions.
Obviously, the design of highly active fully noble metal-free photocatalytic systems is of prime importance in the field of photocatalysis. Besides the use of ruthenium-based photosensitisers, photosensitivity may be introduced into MOFs thanks to the light absorbing properties of organic linkers such as porphyrins. Paille et al. reported in 2018 the immobilisation of the P2W18Co4 POM into the cavities of Zr(IV) porphyrinic MOF-545.108 The photocatalytic OER activity of P2W18Co4@MOF-545 was studied under visible light irradiation in pH 8 borate buffer, using Na2S2O8 as an electron acceptor and in the absence of any external photosensitiser. The POM@MOF composite was shown to be an excellent catalyst to oxidise water into O2 (TOF = 40 × 10−3 s−1 calculated for the first 15 min, TON = 70 after 1 h) (Fig. 45d). Notably, the free porphyrin was not able to photosensitise the free P2W18Co4 POM. This was interpreted as a shift of the valence band (HOMO) of the porphyrin in the MOF, which increased the driving force for water oxidation. Although the TONs were slightly lower for the second and third cycles, addition of a fresh solution of the sacrificial acceptor resulted in an O2 production with the same initial TOF. Moreover, TGA, XRD, and EDS analysis supported that the POM@MOF composite remained intact after catalysis. It was proposed that the photocatalytic mechanism could be decomposed into four steps, with the visible light capture by the porphyrin, the one-electron oxidation of the excited porphyrin by the sacrificial electron acceptor, the one-electron oxidation of the POM, and finally, after accumulation of 4 oxidising equivalents on the POM, the oxidation of water into O2 (Fig. 46).

Mukhopadhyay et al. presented in 2018 a robust catalyst for the electrochemical oxidation of water consisting of the Keggin anion [CoW12O40]6− (CoW12) inserted into ZIF-8.203 The immobilised POMs underwent partial electronic redistribution and increment of electron density from the MOF host, making it favourable for reversible electron transfer. Electrocatalytic water oxidation investigations showed promising performances with sustained oxygen evolution, while the POM alone was not able to perform the water oxidation under these conditions (Fig. 47a). The TOF calculated from the quantitative oxygen evolution was 10.8 mol O2(mol Co)−1 s−1. CoW12@ZIF-8 retained its initial activity even after 1000 catalytic cycles and chronoamperometric measurements showed a very small drop in catalytic current (Fig. 47b), while the physical POM and MOF mixture could not sustain 10 catalytic cycles due to the degradation of the POM.

In 2020 Abdelkader-Fernández et al. prepared an efficient OER electrocatalyst by encapsulating the cobalt trisubstituted silicotungstic Keggin POM SiW9Co3 into the cages of Co-based ZIF-67 and Zn-based ZIF-8 MOFs.140 A 24 times higher OER activity of the SiW9Co3@ZIF-67 composite compared to that of the SiW9Co3 POM was observed. Also, in comparison with pristine ZIF-67, the SiW9Co3@ZIF-67 composite exhibited a remarkable OER performance upon increasing the current density values by two, reducing the overpotential by 110 mV and decreasing the Tafel slope by 21%. The high activity of the SiW9Co3@ZIF-67 composite was attributed to the activation of the Co2+ centres of the POM via electron transfer with the surrounding ZIF-67 – promoted by the significant conductivity of ZIF-67 along with good host–guest orbital overlapping – and to the possible generation of two/three coordinated Co sites in ZIF-67 induced by the encapsulation of the POM. In comparison, SiW9Co3@ZIF-8 exhibited no such prominent OER activity even though the amount and distribution of incorporated SiW9Co3 units were independent of the ZIF type (ZIF-8 or ZIF-67), indicating the decisive role of Co2+ nodes in the ZIF-67 skeleton. Finally, the activity of POM@MOF composite only presents a very small drop after 12 h of chronoamperometry test.
Following their work on CoW12@ZIF-8,203 Mukhopadhyay et al. reported in 2020 an efficient and robust composite for the electrocatalytic OER constructed by the co-encapsulation of the Fe(salen) catalyst and the SiW12 POM into the cavities of ZIF-8 via in situ synthesis.139 This material exhibited high TOF (≈5 s−1) and high faradaic efficiency (≈94%). The superior activity of the (Fe(salen),SiW12)@ZIF-8 composite to that of POM-free Fe(salen)@ZiF-8 was attributed to both the increase in charge transfer in the material, lowering the overall electrical resistance, and a higher loading of Fe-salen. Unlike the free [Fe(salen)Cl] complex which showed a rapid decrease in onset current after 10 cyclic voltammetry scans, the (Fe(salen),SiW12)@ZIF-8 composite showed only a slight loss of catalytic current after 500 cyclic voltammetry cycles. Furthermore, no leaching of Fe(II) or Fe(III) species together with the intact crystallinity of the composite after the catalytic event, with no formation of iron oxides, corroborated the genuine catalytic behaviour and robustness of Fe(salen)@ZiF-8 toward the electrochemical OER.
Besides acting as supports for the preparation of POM@MOF materials, MOFs have also been reported to act as porous templates allowing accessing POM@transition metal oxide materials after calcination. In this way, Lan et al. reported in 2016 the synthesis of PW12@ZIF-67 materials prepared by the direct incorporation of various amounts of phosphotungstic acid into the ZIF-67 cobalt MOF, affording [Co(C4H5N2)2]159H3PW12O40 (ZW-1), [Co(C4H5N2)2]96H3PW12O40 (ZW-2) and [Co(C4H5N2)2]36H3PW12O40 (ZW-3) compounds.142 After thermal treatment at 350 °C, a series of porous hollow spinel-type PW12@Co3O4 compounds were obtained. The photocatalytic water oxidation performed under visible-light illumination in Na2SiF6/NaHCO3 buffer solution (pH 6.0), using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as a photosensitiser and Na2S2O8 as the sacrificial electron acceptor, showed that an increase in POM concentration resulted in materials with higher activities, with a highest TOF of 1.11 × 10−3 s−1 (Fig. 48a). The composite materials exhibited an enhanced reproducible photocurrent response under visible-light irradiation (Fig. 48b) and the photocurrent density of the composite materials increased when the POM concentration increased. The prepared materials were more active than pure Co3O4 and their photocatalytic performances were close to the most active Co3O4-based materials.142 Besides, the authors found that related materials annealed at temperatures greater than 400 °C were less catalytically active. Finally, it was demonstrated that the 350 °C-calcined materials retained their crystallinity and catalytic activity after three recycling experiments.

5.3.2 Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). 
The development of efficient catalysts for the photo- or electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial to establish future carbon-free energy systems, and in this respect, MOFs as matrices to support HER catalysts have attracted specific research efforts. In 2018, Li et al. described the immobilisation of Wells–Dawson-type POMs, P2W15V3, P2W17Ni, and P2W17Co, into the cavities of MIL-101(Cr) for visible light-driven hydrogen production.59 The negative charge of the POMs immobilised into the POM@MOF composites allowed them to efficiently adsorb the dicationic photosensitiser [Ru(bpy)3]2+ present in the solution. The catalytic tests were performed in DMF/CH3CN (7/3) using triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor (Fig. 49). After 8 h of visible light irradiation, TONs of 56, 50, and 49 were determined for P2W15V3@MIL-101(Cr), P2W17Ni@MIL-101(Cr) and P2W17Co@MIL-101(Cr), respectively. These POM@MIL-101(Cr) materials were more active than their related POM-containing homogeneous catalytic counterparts under the same reaction conditions. This was rationalized considering that the MIL-101(Cr) host not only allows the uniform distribution of POMs in its 3D matrix but also enhances the concentration in [Ru(bpy)3]2+ around the confined POMs. Still, the similar reactivities of the three POM@MOF composites suggested that the hydrogen evolution rate could be controlled by diffusive processes related to the MOF structure. The recyclability experiments of P2W15V3@MIL-101(Cr) showed unchanged reactivity over three catalytic cycles, with the structural integrity of the composite being maintained after photocatalysis. The same immobilisation strategy was further used for the adsorption of smaller anionic Mo2S122− units that could easily enter the cages of MOFs. The Mo2S12@MIL-101(Cr) material demonstrated an excellent photocatalytic HER activity with a H2 evolution rate of up to 25578 μmol h−1 g−1 (TON = 237) in 8 h under visible light irradiation, again higher than that of the related homogenous system.

In 2015 Nasalevich et al. prepared a noble metal free HER catalyst by the encapsulation of cobaloxime catalytic complexes (Coox) into the pores of the Ti-based photoactive NH2-MIL-125(Ti) MOF.159 Under visible-light irradiation, in CH3CN/H2O (50/1), with triethylamine (TEA) as an electron donor, the Coox@NH2-MIL-125(Ti) composite maintained a constant H2 TOF of 0.8 h−1 even after 65 h. The composite showed remarkable photocatalytic performances compared to the pristine NH2-MIL-125(Ti). The authors proposed that photon-absorption by the MOF linker resulted in charge separation to generate reduced Ti3+ centers and a hole at the organic linker. The hole then reacted with the electron donor, while the electron was rapidly injected into the Co species within the pores to reduce Co(III) to Co(II), finally resulting in the hydrogen evolution reaction (Fig. 50). The Coox@MOF catalyst was recycled at least three times without loss of activity. In addition, no activity of the filtrate obtained after isolation of the catalyst was observed, confirming that the catalysis was heterogeneous exclusively.

In 2016, Li et al. immobilised via a ship in a bottle strategy the HER photocatalyst [Co(TPA)Cl]Cl (TPA = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)-amine) into the same NH2-MIL-125(Ti) MOF. Due to the congestion of the precursors around the pore windows of the MOF, only a limited amount of Co(II) complexes could be incorporated into the pores, with the Co contents between 0.97 and 1.93 wt%. Nevertheless, under illumination with visible light in a CH3CN/TEOA/H2O medium, the 1.93 wt%Co(TPA)Cl@NH2-MIL-125(Ti) composite exhibited a H2 production rate of 553 μmol g−1 h−1, higher than that of any component of the catalyst or their physical mixture. Based on the results of ESR analysis, the authors proposed that the photoelectrons produced by NH2-BDC during irradiation directly transferred to the Co(II) complex, reducing Co2+ to Co+, followed by the reduction of H+ to H2 and the re-oxidation of the cobalt centre. This mechanism was thus close to the one proposed by Nasalevich (Fig. 50).159 Also, it was shown that Co(TPA)Cl@NH2-MIL-125(Ti) displayed almost unchanged activity during the recycling experiments up to three runs, maintaining its structural integrity throughout the catalytic events.
In 2016, Bu et al. used the SiW12@UiO-67 material as a support for CdS nanoparticles and the MoS2/reduced graphene oxide (M/G) co-catalyst.104 The resulting SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS composite showed an optimal H2 production of 1.27 mmol h−1 with 30 wt%SiW12@UiO-67 in the presence of 5% M/G (Fig. 51a and b). This amount of H2 produced was almost twice as high as that of the related MOF-free POM@M/G–CdS material.

(c) Proposed mechanism. Reaction conditions: 0.1 g catalyst; 5 wt% MoS2–RGO loaded; 160 mL aqueous solution containing 30 vol% lactic acid; light source: 300 W Xe lamp (λ > 400 nm).

The superior performance of SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS was ascribed to the large specific surface area of SiW12@UiO-67 and the effective heterostructure between SiW12@UiO-67 and CdS. This allowed photogenerated electron transfer from the conduction band of CdS to the LUMO of SiW12@UiO-67 and thus to M/G, or by direct transfer from the CdS conduction band to M/G (Fig. 51c). In addition, the SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS composite showed an enhanced durability compared to CdS.
Recently, a photochemical HER system fabricated by the sole encapsulation of PW12 within the pores of NH2-UiO-66 in a one-step solvothermal method was reported by Tian et al.98 The higher catalytic performance of PW12@NH2-UiO-66 (H2 production multiplied by 6.2) compared to pristine NH2-UiO-66 was explained by the fact that the photo-generated electrons from π-conjugated electrons in NH2-BDC were transferred to PW12. This could hinder the recombination of electron–hole pairs and create surface redox-reaction sites. Note that these photocatalytic studies were performed with a Xe lamp with no cut-off for UV light.
Photoexcitation in the visible range often requires the use of Ru- or Ir-based photosensitisers. In 2015, Zhang et al. reported the encapsulation of P2W18 into the cavities of a UiO derivative containing [Ru(bpy)3]2+-functionalised dicarboxylate ligands through a one-pot self-assembly method.105 Under irradiation with visible light and using methanol as a sacrificial electron donor in aqueous medium (pH 1.8), the POM@UiO photosystem yielded a H2 evolution TON of 79 over 14 h, while no activity was observed in the homogenous reference system. According to the authors, this superior activity of the POM@UiO system was ascribed to the facile multielectron injection from the six and twelve [Ru(bpy)3]2+-based ligands located in the tetrahedral and octahedral cages, respectively, into the encapsulated POM. The POM@UiO composite was re-used for three catalytic cycles with only slight losses in activity and crystallinity. One year later, the same group immobilised the Ni-based POM [Ni4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2]10− (P2W18Ni4) into the pores of the [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+-derived UiO-MOF to perform photochemical and electrochemical hydrogen evolution.106 A visible-light driven H2 evolution experiment carried out in aqueous solution at pH 1.2 with methanol as a sacrificial electron donor showed that the TON associated with the POM@MOF reached 1476 after 72 h of reaction, while the homogeneous counterparts showed only traces of H2. Again, the close proximity between the [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ PSs and POMs allowed facile electron transfer from the former to the latter. The material retained its activity over three catalytic cycles.
In 2014, the biomimetic heterogeneous photocatalyst [FeFe]@MOF-545(Zn) was synthesised incorporating the [(i-SCH2)2NC(O)C5H4N]–[Fe2(CO)6] molecular catalyst into the highly robust Zn(TCPP)-based material MOF-545(Zn), where Zn(TCPP) acted as the PS.165 Upon irradiation with visible light and using ascorbic acid as a sacrificial electron donor, the [FeFe]@MOF-545(Zn) composite showed a linear increase in H2 production for the first 50 min, reaching a plateau in 120 min and producing ∼3.5 μmol H2. The homogenous counterpart of the composite showed a lower activity and a dramatic decrease in the activity after 40 min. The higher activity of [FeFe]@MOF-545(Zn) was probably due to the enhanced stability of the incorporated [FeFe] complex. No recycling experiments were reported in this case.


5.3.3 CO2 reduction reaction. 
The transformation of CO2 into hydrocarbons is of vital importance as the hydrocarbons produced (CO, HCOOH, CH4, CH3OH,…) represent important energy carriers. Inspired by the photosynthesis, the development of systems made of photosensitisers, catalysts, and sacrificial reducing agents is appealing to generate hydrocarbon fuels from CO2. However, due to the high kinetic and thermal stability of CO2, its reduction is an energy intensive process. Although several molecular catalysts incorporating second and third row transition metals have been developed so far, their limited stability and reusability remain major issues. Their incorporation into MOF matrices represents interesting alternatives.
In 2018, a heterogeneous catalyst for CO2 reduction was designed by the co-immobilisation of the molecular [Cp*Rh(4,4′-bpydc)Cl]+ rhodium catalyst and the [Ru(bpy)2(4,4′-bpydc)]2+ photosensitizer into the large pore NH2-MIL-101(Al), affording the Rh–Ru@NH2-MIL-101(Al) photosystem.153 The carboxylic groups of both the catalyst and the PS contributed to enhancing host–guest hydrogen-bond interactions and preventing their leaching. Interestingly, the photocatalytic activity of the photosystem made of Rh@NH2-MIL-101(Al) and free PS accounts for only 50% of that of Rh–Ru@NH2-MIL-101(Al), emphasizing the benefit of co-immobilising the two components into the MOF. Rh–Ru@NH2-MIL-101(Al) showed a remarkable selectivity for formate formation. This contrasted with the [Cp*Rh(4,4′-bpydc)Cl]+/PS homogeneous system, which led to H2 as the major product, clearly indicating the role of the MOF which acted as an inhibitor for the proton reduction reaction. Finally, recyclability experiments evidenced some decrease in the catalytic activity due to the well-known photobleaching/photodegradation of the ruthenium-based PS.
In 2019, the encapsulation of [NiII(bpet)(H2O)2] (bpet = 1,2-bis((pyridin-2-ylmethyl)thio)ethane) into the cages of photoactive Ru-UiO-67 through a “ship in a bottle” synthetic approach was reported by Yan et al.163 An almost linear increase in the generation of CO was observed over the first 10 h upon irradiation with a LED lamp (82 W, λ = 450 nm) with 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazole (BIH) as a sacrificial electron donor and TEOA. The Ni@Ru-UiO-67 composite loaded with 0.31 wt% of Ni complex exhibited a CO evolution rate of 426.0 μmol g−1 h−1 (yield: 85.2 mmol) with a TON of 510, while those with 0.15 wt% and 0.23 wt% loadings showed lower CO evolution rates of 55.2 μmol g−1 h−1 (yield: 11.0 μmol, TON: 136) and 196.8 μmol g−1 h−1 (yield: 39.3 μmol, TON: 317), respectively. These results highlighted the influence of the Ni loading on the performances of the material. At higher irradiation times (20 h) using 0.31 wt%Ni@UiO-67, the CO production reaches a plateau with a TON of 581 and a CO selectivity of >99%. From a mechanistic point of view, the combination of electrochemical experiments, advanced ultrafast absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations suggested that photoelectrons produced by the Ru-ligand fragments are directly transferred to the Ni(II) catalyst to form Ni0 species which reduce CO2 to CO. Finally, a good stability and recyclability of the 0.31 wt%Ni@MOF composite were found (Fig. 52). The heterogeneous system exhibited a better durability than the related homogeneous ones by limiting self-aggregation and oxidative self-degradation processes.

Liu et al. reported in 2018 the encapsulation of [PW10Ti2O40]7− into HKUST-1 (NENU-10) where the POM acted as both an electron/proton reservoir and reactive centers for CO2 reduction and the deposition of Au nanoparticles for light-harvesting, affording the Au@PTi2W10@HKUST-1 (also named Au@NENU-10) composite.118 Under visible light irradiation, the composite showed CO and H2 yields of 12.8 and 2.6 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively (in addition to the production of methane), i.e. 85-fold and 5-fold higher than those reported for the PW12-containing analogue composite. The difference between the crystal shapes of Au@NENU-10 and Au@NENU-3 was mentioned for explaining the improved catalytic performance of the Ti-POM system. Finally, the Au@NENU-10 composite exhibited excellent structural stability over three catalytic cycles (Fig. 53).

The immobilisation of MCp2 (M = Fe, Co, Ni) metallocenes into the cavities of the porphyrinic MOF-545(Co) host was reported in 2020 by Chen, Lan and coworkers.166 The MCp2@MOF-545(Co) composites exhibit excellent catalysis performances in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. CoCp2@MOF-545(Co) was reported as the most efficient composite with a high faradaic efficiency FECO of 97% at −0.7 V when compared to those of the reference materials, MOF-545(Co) (54.6%) and CoCp2@MOF-545 (19.8%). Relying on experimental evidence and DFT calculations (see above), the authors proposed that CoCp2 both enriches the electron density of the MOF structure and favors the adsorption of CO2 on the metalloporphyrin, supporting the better performances of the CoCp2@MOF-545(Co) composite over other materials for CO2 electrocatalytic reduction.
Finally, the co-immobilisation of the PW12 POM and Cp*Rh catalyst was reported with the (PW12,Cp*Rh)@UiO-67 composite as a catalytic composite for CO2 reduction.103 Although the PW12 guest is not catalytically active here, the POM can play for this reaction the role of proton or electron relay. The production of formate and H2 under visible-light irradiation (acetonitrile, TEOA as an electron and proton donor, Ru(bpy)3Cl2 as a PS) was indeed significantly enhanced with the (PW12,Cp*Rh)@UiO-67 composite when compared to that of POM-free Cp*Rh@UiO-67. The (PW12,Cp*Rh)@UiO-67 composite was also deposited as films on ITO plates, providing enhanced formate TONs when compared to the suspension (175 compared to 14.6, at 3 h), as well as evidence for the stability and the recyclability of the system. The former was attributed to the better illumination of the crystallites deposited on the ITO plate when compared to usual photocatalytic experiments performed on a suspension.


5.3.4 Other photo/electro-catalytic reactions. 
5.3.4.1 Oxidation reactions. 
In 2015, Liang et al. reported a photocatalyst resulting from the encapsulation of PMo12 in the pores of MIL-100(Fe) for the oxidation of benzyl alcohols.88 Under visible-light irradiation and an O2 atmosphere, the higher photocatalytic activity of PMo12@MIL-100(Fe) (with 30 wt% PMo12) when compared to that of MIL-100(Fe) was assigned to the enhanced light absorption and more efficient separation of the charge-carriers in the presence of the POM. The PMo12@MIL-100(Fe) material showed an excellent reusability over four catalytic cycles, with the composite retaining its integrity during the catalysis process. The absence of Fe and Mo leaching during the course of reaction was indicative of the heterogenous nature of the catalytic event.
In 2019, the incorporation of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ into the cavities of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) to catalyse the oxidation of benzyl alcohol was reported by Isaka et al.161 While no significant amount of oxidised product was observed under homogeneous conditions with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as a catalyst (visible light, O2 saturated acetonitrile solution), Ru(bpy)3@NH2-MIL-125(Ti) presented a high activity for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde (Fig. 54a). This was attributed to the synergetic catalytic activity of the Ru complex (for reducing O2) and NH2-MIL-125(Ti) (for reducing benzaldehyde), which resulted in the rapid formation of O2˙− and ˙OH species, which were further involved in the substrate oxidation mechanism. It was found that much lower amounts of benzaldehyde were formed when using the Ru complex-free MOF or a physical mixture of the Ru complex and the MOF. No leaching of the Ru complex was observed after 8 h of reaction, and the catalytic activity of the Ru(bpy)3@NH2-MIL-125(Ti) composite was maintained for at least three catalytic cycles.

Wang et al. reported in 2016 the encapsulation of the same [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex within the cavities of the anionic PCN-99 MOF in order to catalyse the aerobic hydroxylation of arylboronic acids.173 Yet, a reduced catalytic activity was observed for Ru(bpy)3@PCN-99 when compared to that of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 in homogenous solution (Fig. 54b), which was attributed to the fact that the framework structure partially impedes the access of substrates. It was noted that the Ru(bpy)3@PCN-99 composite maintained a similar activity in the second catalytic cycle, while a slight leaching of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ from the MOF was observed, possibly due to the partial decomposition of the metal–organic framework under basic catalytic conditions.
In 2019, the incorporation of the Ru complex [Ru(bpy)3]2+ into MIL-125(Ti) was also studied.158 The Ru(bpy)3@MIL-125(Ti) composite with 0.58% Ru content is an excellent catalyst to perform photooxidative coupling of amines to imines (Fig. 54c), with 75% conversion yield and a full selectivity within 3 h of reaction under visible-light irradiation and an oxygen atmosphere. The crystalline structure of the MOF provided for the charge carriers short migration paths to the surface for reacting with substrates. Ru@MIL-125(Ti) maintained its structural integrity after the reaction as well as its catalytic activity after five catalytic cycles (Fig. 54c).
5.3.4.2 Reduction reactions. 
The reduction of Cr(VI) by PMo12@MIL-100(Fe) was reported in 2015 by Liang et al.88 With 5 wt% of encapsulated PMo12 within the MOF-100(Fe) cavities, almost 100% reduction of Cr(IV) was observed after 8 min of visible-light illumination. The activity of the catalyst remained constant even after four catalytic cycles. Also, Fernandes et al. reported in 2014 an electroactive catalyst, SiW11Fe@MIL-101(Cr), to carry out electrochemical nitrite and iodate reduction as well as ascorbic acid oxidation.37 The SiW11Fe@MIL-101(Cr) composite immobilised onto a pyrolytic graphite electrode exhibited an excellent activity towards nitrite reduction with a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.2 × 10−5 mol dm−3. This value was not only somewhat lower than that of SiW11Fe (4.2 × 10−5 mol dm−3) but also lower than the LOD observed for SiW11Fe immobilised onto other electrodes modified by other methodologies (≈7.2 × 10−5 mol dm−3). The higher sensitivity of SiW11Fe@MIL-101(Cr) was attributed to the higher concentration of SiW11Fe in porous MIL-101 than on a bare electrode surface. Similarly, the iodate electroreduction catalysed with SiW11Fe@MIL-101(Cr) showed a lower LOD (3.0 × 10−5 mol dm−3) than with SiW11Fe (5.9 × 10−5 mol dm−3). Electrochemical characterisation revealed that only the POM moiety in SiW11Fe@MIL-101(Cr) acts as a catalyst in the electro-reduction of these substrates. In contrast, the ascorbic acid electro-oxidation catalysed by SiW11Fe@MIL-101(Cr) was attributed to the synergetic effect of the chromium centres of MIL-101(Cr) and the encapsulated SiW11Fe species.

6. Conclusion
While Cat@MOF composites involving the covalent grafting of the catalyst to the MOF have been widely explored, we have herein focused on a related and emerging sub-class of composites whereby the catalytic guest interacts with its MOF host via short-range host–guest interactions, electrostatic interactions and/or hydrogen bonding. Focusing on this class of functionalised materials, this review shows that the field of these Cat@MOF materials has exploded over the last ten years, with a tremendous diversity of catalytic applications. Although seminal catalysts such as PW12 or metallated porphyrin or phthalocyanines have been privileged, an ever-growing variety of catalysts are incorporated into MOFs, leading to increasingly complex composites with excellent catalytic performances, stability and reusability. Such developments are allowed considering that three synthetic strategies – encapsulation, impregnation and “ship in a bottle” strategies – are available, allowing synthetic chemists to adopt the most appropriate method to successfully immobilise molecular compounds known to be unstable under the MOF's synthetic conditions and/or of dimensions significantly larger than the dimensions of the MOF windows. Moreover, these rather simple synthetic approaches when compared to those required for the covalent grafting of the catalyst to the MOF can afford systems with strong and specific Cat–MOF interactions. This is highlighted in particular with the use of emerging characterization techniques such as PDF combined with theoretical calculations or solid-state NMR, which proved to be key to providing accurate structural descriptions of increasingly complex composites. Altogether, the numerous studies reported so far tend to confirm that such Cat@MOF composites offer specific advantages in view of their use in catalytic applications. Above all, the synthesis of Cat@MOFs is an accessible route for turning molecular homogenous catalysts into heterogenous systems, whereby their stability may be increased due to their immobilisation into the MOF's pores or channels. In particular, this immobilisation usually prevents the deactivation process, which generally occurs via the catalyst's aggregation under homogenous conditions, while ensuring the recyclability of the Cat@MOF as observed in most cases. It must also be underlined that in some composites, the MOF not only acts as a support for the molecular catalysts but can also play the role of co-catalyst leading sometimes to synergetic effects. Still, one major drawback of these materials is that mass transfer processes can be hindered in MOF crystals with large sizes, preventing the diffusion of the reactants towards the catalytic sites. Another possible issue which may occur with Cat@MOFs prepared by impregnation of the molecular catalyst is the resulting non-homogeneity in the catalyst's distribution. In this respect, the synthesis of nanocrystals of MOFs (the so-called nanoMOFs) is one very important way to improve both the homogeneity of the catalyst's distribution within the porous network and limit mass transfer issues. A further step is to deposit the particles of MOFs on solid supports as thin films to allow a better processability and improve their catalytic performances, as exemplified in recent photocatalytic studies.103,269 Another promising aspect of Cat@MOFs is that the rational design of multi-component and thus multi-functional chemical systems is indeed possible, although still scarcely explored. Illustratively, we note that among the many Complex@MOFs and POM@MOFs considered in this review, less than a handful of composites result from the co-immobilisation of two guests, whereby each guest has a specific role. We can cite three composites, (RhH(CO)(PPh3)3,PW12O40)@MIL-101(Cr),51 ([Fe(salen)(OH)],SiW12O40)@ZIF-8139 and (Cp*Rh(4,4′-bpydc)Cl,Ru(bpy)2(4,4′-bpydc))@NH2-MIL-101(Al).153 In the first material, the catalyst is the Rh complex, while the POM helps the Rh complex immobilisation. Similarly, in the second one, the Fe-salen is the active catalyst, while the POM improves the loading of Fe-salen. In the third material, both the Rh catalytic complex and the Ru photosensitiser are co-confined into the MOF pores, which play the role of nanoreactors. These complementarities indicate that such multi-component approaches must lead to important future developments in this sub-class of materials for catalytic applications. We can finally underline that, importantly, efforts should be made for considering green routes for MOF synthesis270 and selecting noble metal-free catalysts. Also, the limited conductivity of MOF-based materials remains a problem for electro(photo)catalytic applications. In this respect, the encapsulation of selected species (quantum dots,271 complexes,166 …) allows boosting the performance of the composites. Besides, thermal treatments up to the carbonisation of MOFs is a recent strategy to obtain new conductive carbonaceous materials with anchored single-atom catalysts (SACs).272 In such process, the use of Cat@MOFs is one way to obtain multi-metallic active sites (via the MOF and the Cat), especially interesting in view of electrochemical catalytic applications. As they represent a particularly appealing emerging family of catalysts, Cat@MOF may thus be also seen as precursors for the preparation of a new generation of highly active catalytic materials.

	Mathis Duguet and Youven Benseghir are PhD students working on the immobilisation of active species into porous networks for the photo(electro)catalytic reduction of CO2, through a collaboration between two laboratories at the Institut Lavoisier de Versailles (ILV) and the Collège de France (Paris). Priyanka Gairola obtained her PhD in 2019 from Sorbonne Université. She then started her postdoctoral research on polyoxometalates incorporated in zirconium-based metal–organic frameworks for the photodegradation of organic pollutants at ILV and ICMMO (Université Paris-Saclay). Olivier Oms received his PhD in 2003 in molecular and solid chemistry from Montpellier University. After postdoctoral research at the University of Geneva and then in Université Paris VI (now Sorbonne Université), he was appointed as Associate Professor at the Université de Versailles (UVSQ) in 2009. Pierre Mialane received his PhD in 1997 in bioinorganic chemistry from Université Paris XI (now Université Paris-Saclay). He then joined the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm as a postdoctoral researcher. He started his academic career in 1999 at UVSQ where he is currently Professor. Anne Dolbecq received her PhD in inorganic chemistry from Université Paris XI in 1995. After a postdoctoral stay in the University of California, Berkeley, and then in Université Paris VI, she was appointed in CNRS in 1997 at UVSQ where she is Directrice de recherche. Olivier Oms, Pierre Mialane and Anne Dolbecq are working on functionalized polyoxometalates and polyoxometalate-based materials for applications ranging from catalysis to optical and bioactive materials. Caroline Mellot-Draznieks obtained her PhD in 1993 from Sorbonne Université. Following an R&D position at Air Liquide and a post-doctoral stay in the University of California, Santa Barbara, she was appointed in CNRS in 2008. She is currently Directrice de recherche at the Collège de France. Her current interests are related to nanoporous materials for adsorption and catalysis combining computational chemistry and experimental approaches.
