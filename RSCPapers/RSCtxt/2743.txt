    , Accepted 21st April 2021First published on 26th April 2021AbstractLead halide perovskites have demonstrated excellent performance for light emitting diodes and detectors. However, the toxicity of lead (Pb) in the devices severely impedes their widespread application and commercialization. The design of lead-free perovskites for environmentally friendly devices is an imperative mission, but full of challenges. In this perspective, we mainly discuss the design strategy of lead-free perovskites, as well as theoretical understanding and experimental demonstrations of their electronic and optical properties. The present status and future prospects of each lead-free perovskite are also summarized in the review, which could give a better understanding and right direction for the further exploration of satisfactory optoelectronic devices. We also provide the up-to-date progress of lead-free perovskites in the applications of light-emitting devices and radiation detectors.
1. Introduction
Lead halide perovskites have gained unprecedented success in various applications, including solar cells, light emitting diodes, detectors, etc.1–3 Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have reached a power conversion efficiency of 29.15%, which surpasses that of the best silicon single-junction cell (26.7%) and is even comparable to that of the best GaAs solar cell (29.1%).4 For light emitting applications, perovskites exhibit a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY > 90%), narrow full width at half maximum (12–25 nm), and wide color gamut (150% NTSC).5 Such excellent optoelectronic performance of perovskites is attributed to their unique advantages, such as defect-tolerant nature, low trap density, long carrier lifetime and carrier diffusion length, as well as low temperature solution process.
However, the issue of lead toxicity remains a long-lasting debate. As a highly poisonous metal, Pb can accumulate in the human body and cause several brain related symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation and headaches. The immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH) value for lead is only 100 mg m−3, which means humans are very vulnerable to Pb poisoning.6 Moreover, lead halide perovskites are highly soluble in water due to the nature of their ionic crystal, and their leaching into the environment could jeopardize local biological systems. Therefore, the EU RoHS regulation limit for electronic devices is 1000 ppm Pb.7 Although some researchers demonstrated that strict encapsulation could reduce the possible leakage of lead, it is hard to ensure the safety during the production and long-term storage. The concern of Pb toxicity has severely impeded the further application of perovskites. Hence, the development of lead-free perovskites would be an important, but highly challenging, breakthrough in future photoelectronic fields.
However, numerous experimental and theoretical studies have indicated that Pb plays a predominant role in perovskite devices. For example, Pb has a unique atomic electronic configuration with lone-pair Pb 6s2 electrons and an empty Pb 6p orbital, as well as a large size and heavy mass, contributing to strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC). Such high SOC leads to increased band dispersion, decreased effective masses of electrons and holes, and thereby high mobility.8 The Pb 6s2 6p0 states lead to a high joint density of states and high optical absorption. In addition, Yin and co-workers stated that the strong antibonding coupling formed between the Pb lone-pair 6s orbital and I 5p orbitals enabled superior defect tolerance nature and therefore only shallow defects were observed in lead halide perovskites.9 As a result, the trap density of lead halide perovskites is rather low (1015 to 1017 cm−3 for the film; ∼1010 cm−3 for single crystals), which is even comparable to the best value of crystalline silicon, in spite of their totally different preparation methods.1,10 In addition, the large dielectric constant of perovskite materials can help screen electrons and holes to prevent the recombination. Therefore, the exploration of some nontoxic substitutes for Pb in perovskites yet preserving its outstanding characteristics would be a feasible approach for the design of lead-free perovskites.
Recently, considerable efforts have been made for the design strategy of lead-free perovskites. In addition to the above considerations, the composition, structure and electronic dimensionality should also be carefully engineered for specific applications. Meanwhile, the stability issues, another intractable conundrum of lead halide perovskite-based devices, should also be taken into consideration for lead-free perovskites.
As for detecting and light emitting devices, the design strategy of lead-free perovskites is different from that of solar cells. For detecting purposes, achieving a low noise signal is a priority. From the perspective of semiconductors, the resistivity of perovskites should be large to suppress thermal noise and shot noise, and thus semiconductors should possess low carrier density. However, for light emitting devices, good carrier confinement of the materials is rather important to produce superior photoluminescence and electroluminescence. Therefore zero, one and two dimensionality of crystal structures are necessary. Although some studies have been demonstrated by replacing Pb2+ in perovskites with alternative metal ions, further advances could be expected through better understanding and engineering of the materials to pursue good optoelectronic properties. In this review, we will focus on the recent progress of lead-free perovskites and perovskite variants, including theoretical predictions, property characterization, and their applications in light emitting and detecting devices.
2. Perovskite structure
For a typical chemical composition of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite ABX3, A-site cations are inserted into the cuboctahedral cages formed by BX6 octahedra. Two parameters are used to evaluate the possibility to form a perovskite structure, tolerance factor t and octahedral factor μ. The tolerance factor is defined as and the octahedral factor is defined as μ = rB/rX, where rA, rB, and rX represents the ionic radius of A, B, and X ions. According to the (t, μ) map for existing perovskites in many papers, t should be 0.875 ≤ t < 1.107, and 0.414 ≤ μ < 0.592.11–13 If t > 1.107, the A-site cation would be too large and could form a lower dimensional structure; if t < 0.8, the A-site cation would be too small, leading to non-perovskite structures like CsPbI3. In terms of the octahedral factor, a μ smaller than 0.414 could result in a lower coordination number of the B cation, and when μ is higher than 0.592, a 7-coordinated capped octahedron may form as a thermodynamically stable phase.
In addition to 3D perovskites, there are also 2D, 1D and 0D perovskite structures. As shown in Fig. 1, layered perovskites can be viewed as slicing along specific crystallographic directions from 3D analogues, such as 〈100〉, 〈110〉 and 〈111〉 directions.14 Larger tolerance factor and higher valence states could both lead to low dimensional perovskite structure formation. For example, Cs3Bi2Br9 and Cs3Sb2Br9 perovskites could be viewed as cutting along the 〈111〉 direction with q = 2 in order to keep the charge balance.

The thermodynamic stability of metal halide perovskites is another key factor in the formation of perovskite structures. The most robust method is to utilize density-functional theory to calculate the decomposition enthalpy into other phases. All possible decomposition pathways should be considered during theoretical studies, such as competing secondary phases, non-stoichiometric ratio phases, oxidation or reduction of precursors, etc. A recent study by Yin and co-workers found the linear relationship between the thermodynamic stability of 138 kinds of cubic perovskites and the structural descriptor (μ + t)η, where η denotes the atomic packing fraction (APF). The APF value (η = (VA + VB + 3VX)/a3, where VA, VB and VX are the atomic volumes of A, B and X, and a is the lattice constant of the cubic cell) represents the fraction of volume in a crystal structure, which is occupied by constituent atoms treated with a rigid sphere (Fig. 2).15 The value of (μ + t)η can predict the relative stability within an accuracy rate of ∼90%. Till now, theoretical studies have successfully predicted the presence of many lead-free perovskites like ASnX3, AGeX3, A3Bi2X9, A3Sb2X9, A2AgBiX6, A2AgInX6,etc., with confirmation by experimental results.

3. Electronic and optical properties
The optoelectronic properties of these lead-free materials are the most important issue to be taken into consideration. As noted above, the unique atomic electronic configuration of Pb is crucial for the properties of perovskites. Taking CsPbI3 as an example, the conduction band minimum is composed of Pb 6p states and exhibits a triple degeneracy due to the Oh symmetry, while the valence band maximum consists of the antibonding states of Pb 6s and I 5p states. Other metal cations with lone-pair s orbitals, including In+, Tl+, Ge2+, Sn2+, Bi3+ and Sb3+, are potential candidates to replace Pb2+. As shown in Fig. 3, Xiao and co-workers reported that the energy levels of the occupied ns2 states and the unoccupied np0 states could increase in the order of Bi < Sb < Pb < Sn < Tl < In by theoretical calculations.16 Moreover, the lighter elements In, Sn and Sb exhibit shallower and more dispersive ns2 states than the heavier elements Tl, Pb and Bi. Such results would result in smaller band gaps and high carrier mobility. Next we will specify the possible element-based perovskites and the related electronic properties, including band gaps, effective carrier mass, carrier mobility and lifetime, and trap density, as well as some other electronic and optical properties.

3.1 Sn-based perovskites
There are two kinds of Sn-based perovskites, i.e. Sn2+ and Sn4+. Typically, Sn2+-based perovskites exhibit direct band transitions (absorption coefficient ∼104 cm−1 in the visible region) but smaller band gaps than Pb-based analogues (Fig. 4a). For example, the band gap of MASnI3, CsSnI3, and FASnI3 is 1.30, 1.27 and 1.41 eV, respectively, which is smaller than that of the corresponding Pb-based perovskites (MAPbI3: 1.57 eV, CsPbI3: 1.73 eV, and FAPbI3: 1.48 eV).17–20 Such band gap differences are due to the shallower and more active Sn 5s lone pair states of Sn-based perovskites, and thus their valence band maximum (VBM) is more dispersive and higher than that of Pb-based perovskites. The calculated average effective hole mass (mh) of MASnI3 is 0.13 m0, smaller than that of MAPbI3 (0.25 m0).8 Consistently, the experimental results found that the hole mobility of Sn-based perovskites is higher than that of Pb-based perovskites (102 to 103vs. 10 to 102 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively).21 In contrast, because of the much weaker relativistic effects, Sn 5p orbitals are less dispersive than Pb 6p orbitals, thus leading to a higher effective electron mass of MASnI3, compared with MAPbI3 (0.28 vs. 0.19 m0, respectively).8

(d) The influence of additives (SnI2, SnBr2, SnCl2, and SnF2) on the stability of the tin halide perovskite films. Reproduced from ref. 25 with permission from the American Chemical Society. 
Sn2+-based perovskites are p-type semiconductors with a high hole density (1015 to 1017 cm−3).22 Two factors may account for this phenomenon. One is the easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+, thus causing self-doping. The other is that the transition level of the dominant Sn vacancy defect is shallow, and the formation enthalpies is low. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, effective methods have been performed to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+, including the use of SnF2 as an additive, Cl doping, metallic tin via a comproportionation reaction and two dimensional crystal structures.23–26 These approaches could effectively reduce Sn vacancies and control the oxidation state of Sn.
The easy formation of structural defects severely affects the luminescence properties of Sn2+-based perovskites and nanocrystals. CsSnX3 nanocrystals generally exhibited an extremely low photoluminescence quantum yield of <0.2%. Sun and co-workers recently reported that tin-rich reaction conditions, obtained by fine-tuning of the ratio of the precursors, could produce narrow-band-emissive CsSnI3 nanocrystals with a PLQY of 18.4%.27
Unlike Sn2+-based perovskites, Sn4+-based perovskites are ultra-stable in both air and moisture. Taking Cs2SnI6 as an example, it can be viewed as a double perovskite structure with one B-site cation replaced by a vacancy, i.e. A2B□X6, □ represents the vacancy. The [SnI6]2− moieties are separated from each other, forming a 0D structure. Cs2SnI6 has a direct band gap of ∼1.3 eV according to the experimental and theoretical studies. The Hall measurement demonstrated an intrinsic n-type electrical conductivity, with a carrier mobility of 8.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a carrier concentration of ∼5 × 1016 cm−3.28,29 The origin of such a high conductivity is possibly from the presence of dispersive conduction band states and the formation of iodine vacancies. According to the theoretical calculation, the effective electron mass for Cs2SnI6 is me = 0.48 m0 (Γ → X) and me = 0.92 m0 (Γ → L), while the effective hole mass is mh = 1.32 m0 (Γ → X) and mh = 2.75 m0 (Γ → L).29 These values are also consistent with the intrinsic n-type behavior. It should be noted that the photoluminescence of Cs2SnI6 is hardly observed due to phonon quenching. In terms of the band gap, Cs2SnX6, typically has larger band gaps (Eg = 1.34 − 4 eV (X = I, Br, Cl)) compared to that of CsSnX3 (1.3 − 2.7 eV (X = I, Br, Cl)), as shown in Fig. 4b.17
Moreover, Sn4+-based perovskites exhibit no luminescence properties. Attracted by its good stability, some recent studies reported Cs2SnCl6 as a matrix for incorporating various foreign ions like Bi3+, Sb3+ and Te4+, and the PLQY was significantly boosted (Cs2SnCl6: Bi3+, PLQY 78.9%; Cs2SnCl6: Sb3+, PLQY 37%; Cs2Sn0.89Te0.11Cl6, PLQY 95.4%).30–32
3.2 Ge-based perovskites
Ge2+ has similar outer ns2 electrons (4s2) to Sn2+ (5s2) and Pb2+ (6s2), but a smaller ionic radius (0.73 Å). The calculated octahedral factor for AGeI3 is 0.36, lower than the boundary value 0.414, thus causing a highly distorted perovskite structure. In addition, Ge2+ is much easier to oxidize to Ge4+, making Ge2+-based perovskites highly vulnerable to air and moisture. The band gaps of CsGeI3, MAGeI3 and FAGeI3 are 1.63, 2.0 and 2.35 eV, respectively, larger than that of Sn2+ and Pb2+ analogues.34 The hole and electron effective masses for CsGeI3 are 0.22 m0 and 0.42 m0, respectively, which could theoretically provide high carrier mobility.35 Kanatzidis and co-workers reported the synthesis of (CH3)3NHGeI3, C(NH2)3GeI3, and (CH3)2C(H)NH3GeI3, which exhibited indirect band gaps of 2.5, 2.7, and 2.8 eV, respectively, with 1D infinite chain frameworks.36 Overall, studies on Ge2+-based perovskites are still limited.
3.3 Bi and Sb-based perovskites
Bi3+ has the same outer electron configuration and a similar ionic radius, but much lower toxicity compared to Pb2+. Therefore bismuth is a promising substitute for toxic lead. Because of their different valence states, the chemical compositions need to be altered as A3Bi2X9 to preserve the charge neutrality, which inevitably lowers the crystal dimensionality. The choice of A and X sites is critical for the final structures. For example, bioctahedral (Bi2I9)3− clusters are surrounded by Cs+ in the Cs3Bi2I9 configuration, whereas Cs3Bi2Cl9 exhibits one dimensional corner-connected Bi–Cl octahedra, and Cs3Bi2Br9 is composed of two dimensional Bi–Br octahedral layers, with the voids between the layers filled with Cs+ (Fig. 5a and b). The chemical formula for the layered structure can also be expressed as A3(□Bi2)X9 (□ represents the Bi vacancy), while each □ layer and two Bi-atom layers are alternatively stacked along the 〈111〉 direction, as shown in Fig. 5c.14 Similar to Pb-based perovskites, there exist variants for different ratios of metal-to-halide, such as A3BiX6, A3Bi2X9, A2BiX5, ABiX4etc. A lot of work is still required to reveal all the possible compositions and structures for Bi-based perovskites.

(c)_ and (d) are reproduced from ref. 37 with permission from John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 
Crystal dimensionality plays an important role in Bi-based perovskites. Lower crystal dimensionality usually leads to high band gaps, strong carrier confinement and poor carrier transport. Brent C. Melot and co-workers found that the exciton binding energy of 2D Cs3Bi2Br9 is roughly 940 meV, much higher than that of 3D MAPbI3.38 For Cs3Bi2I9, the exciton binding energy is 300 meV, indicating low carrier mobility.39 One recent study experimentally obtained the electron mobility and mobility-lifetime product as 6.10 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.03 × 10−5 cm2 V−1.40 According to the above analysis, it is necessary to control the orientation of Bi-based perovskites to ensure carrier transport within bismuth halide layers to achieve good performance in solar cells and detectors.
Furthermore, another noteworthy character of Bi-based perovskites is their wide photoluminescence wavelength range, such as the wide PL spectra from 1.65 to 2.2 eV for Cs3Bi2I9. Such a trait could be attributed to the strong electron–phonon coupling, which was evidenced by Raman spectroscopy.41 Small polarons, which are induced by the electron–phonon interactions and trap charge carriers, can generate self-trapped excitons. These self-trapped excitons are responsible for the broad emissions through phonon-assisted recombination. Self-trapped excitons (STEs) have some other characteristics, like a large stokes shift and long photoluminescence lifetime, making them potential candidates for white emitting phosphors and solar concentrators.42 Self-trapped excitons have also been observed in some Pb-based perovskites with distorted lattice structures. The remaining issue is the origin of the STE states, i.e. intrinsic self-trapping mediated through electron-lattice coupling or extrinsic self-trapping mediated through self-trapped carriers interacting with permanent material defects.
Sb-based perovskites have similar crystal structures to Bi-based analogues, due to their same valence states and similar electronic configurations. There are also 2D, 1D and 0D structures of Sb-based perovskites. One big difference from Bi-based perovskites is that there are two different structures for the composition of Cs3Sb2I9: 0D dimer structure (space group P63/mmc, no. 194) and 2D form (Pm1, no. 164). By a room temperature spin-coating process, the 0D dimer structure could be easily formed, and the 2D variant could be obtained by annealing in SbI3 vapor.43 The 0D dimer structure has an indirect bandgap of 2.40 eV and the 2D structure has a nearly direct bandgap of 2.04 eV.43 Wessels and co-workers found that the 2D Cs3Sb2I9 phase exhibited an electron mobility of 1.8 ± 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a mobility-lifetime product of 1.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1.44 One recent study claimed a high PLQY of 51.2% for Cs3Sb2Br9 quantum dots, and the SbBrx shell could serve as a strong diffusion barrier against H2O.45
3.4 Double perovskites
Besides the above mono-metal perovskites, double perovskites can be prepared by replacing two lead atoms with one monovalent (BI) and one trivalent (BIII) metal ion. Possible BI and BIII candidates include Na+, Ag+, Cu+, K+, In+, and Tl+, and Bi3+, Sb3+, In3+, and rare earth ions (La3+, Y3+etc.), respectively.46 Recently, Diego Solis-Ibarra and co-workers found that Cu2+ and Sb3+ could also replace lead to form a layered perovskite structure (Cs4CuSb2Cl12).47 Double perovskites also utilize the tolerance factor and octahedral factor as a structural descriptor. It should be noted that the monovalent and trivalent atoms were alternately arranged in a rock salt configuration, i.e. monovalent atoms were separated from each other with trivalent atoms and halides. The disordered arrangement of BI and BIII, i.e. BI-on-BIII and BIII-on-BI antisite, may induce deep level defect states, as shown in Fig. 6a.48 It should be noted that for traditional oxide double perovskites, B′ and B′′ atoms could arrange in a columnar, layer or random lattice structure.49,50 Whether these ordered or disordered structures are applicable to halide double perovskites still remains unknown.

(e) Photoluminescence lifetime of Cs2AgInCl6 with different dopants. Reproduced from ref. 54 with permission from the Nature Publishing Group. 
With respect to band structures, the band gaps of double perovskites are too large for visible light applications. To solve this problem, we can introduce Ag+, Cu+, and Tl+ as BI sites and Bi3+ and Sb3+ as BIII sites in double perovskites. The above-mentioned cations can raise the valence band maximum by forming strong antibonding coupling between cation d or s orbitals with anion p orbitals, while the conduction band minimum mainly consists of trivalent p orbitals and a few monovalent s and halide p orbitals (Fig. 6b).8 Owing to such band compositions, A2AgBiX6 and A2AgSbX6 can be classified as indirect band-gap semiconductors. The indirect transitions contribute to a weak photoluminescence intensity and long carrier lifetime. For instance, a Cs2AgBiBr6 single crystal exhibits a photoluminescence lifetime of 668 ns, as shown in Fig. 6c.
On the other hand, Cs2AgInCl6 has a direct band transition with an optical band-gap of 3.3 eV. As shown in Fig. 6d, the conduction band minimum (CBM) is composed of unoccupied In 5s orbitals. It should be noted that the photoluminescence lifetime of Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2Ag1−xNaxInCl6 is as long as hundred nanoseconds to microseconds (Fig. 6e). This long carrier lifetime is due to the parity-forbidden transitions.55
In terms of carrier mobility, Xiao and co-workers claimed that double perovskites possessed 0D electronic dimensionality, in spite of their 3D structural dimensionality, since their VBM and CBM were derived from different metal sites (BI and BIII).56 Therefore the effective carrier mass of double perovskites is relatively large, and the carrier mobility is typically low, such as 11.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Cs2AgBiBr6.57
4. Optoelectronic applications
4.1 Light emitting applications
There are two major kinds of application scenarios for light emitting, i.e. displays and illumination. For displays, the wide color gamut requires the emitters have a narrow emission width and high efficiency. Lead-free perovskites should be designed accordingly. The major principle is to guarantee the quantum confinement, either by controlling the nanocrystal size or by decreasing the crystal dimensionality. Also, the electron–phonon coupling, which could broaden the emission spectrum, should be avoided, thus requiring the lead-free perovskites have a relatively strong lattice. Sn2+ based perovskites are the first choice for this application.
For illumination, perovskites should exhibit a white emission spectrum with a high color rendering index. Recently various broad emitting lead-free perovskites have emerged. The general design strategy is still lacking, but it is envisioned that low crystal dimensionality (0D and 1D) combined with a soft crystal lattice could contribute to the formation of self-trapped excitons and a broad emission spectrum.
Lead-free perovskites and their variants have also shown promising optoelectronic properties suitable for light-emitting applications on the heels of lead containing perovskites, including phosphors and electroluminescence. In terms of phosphors, lead-free perovskites have displayed promising broadband white-light emissions, due to the above-mentioned self-trapped excitons in low dimensional perovskites (Fig. 7a and b). The reported photoluminescence quantum efficiency of lead-free perovskites exhibited a wide range of 10–90%. For example, (C4N2H14X)4SnX6 (X = Br or I) and (C9NH20)2SbX5 (X = Cl) exhibited PLQYs over 90%.58 Cs2Ag0.60Na0.40InCl6 powder achieved a high PLQY of about 86%, and its commission international de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates is (0.396, 0.448) with a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 4054 K.54 Lately, our group also found that the solid solution of Cs2Sn1−xTexCl6 reached a PLQY of 95.4%, which was attributed to the combination of the Te luminescent center and Jahn–Teller-like self-trapped excitons.32 Different from other metal halides, Cs2Sn1−xTexCl6 is very stable toward water treatments, which bring about new opportunities toward underwater lighting. Other efficient STE emitters have also been designed and synthesized, including (C18H35NH3)2SnBr4 (PLQY: 88%), (octylammonium)2SnX4 (∼100%), Cs3Cu2I5 (91.2%), etc.59–61

In pursuit of perfect phosphors for white light emissions, other parameters should also be taken into consideration for lead-free perovskites, such as the excitation wavelength, CCT value and color rendering index. STE emitters typically require an excitation wavelength in the ultraviolet region and the emission is usually not broad enough for white light spectra, limiting their application circumstances. More deep understanding of the structure–property relationship should be gained to give directions on how to modulate the excitation and emission spectra of lead-free perovskites. Recently, Kovalenko and co-workers presented the strong temperature dependence of the photoluminescence lifetime of self-trapped excitons in low-dimensional tin halides (up to 20 ns °C−1), and this unique property was utilized for remote thermography with a thermometric precision down to 0.013 °C for Cs4SnBr6, as shown in Fig. 7c.62
Besides white lighting, phosphors can also be applied for displays, which requires a narrow emission bandwidth and wide color gamut for materials. Unfortunately, it is still a challenge for lead-free perovskites to achieve a narrow emission bandwidth as lead halide perovskites (<20 nm), and their emission efficiency is also relatively low. For example, Cs2SnCl6:Bi3+ powder showed strong deep blue emission, but with a full-width-at-half-maximum (fwhm) of 66 nm.30 Bi and Sb based perovskite quantum dots exhibited narrower emissions, such as MA3Bi2(Cl, Br)9 QDs (fwhm: 41 nm), Cs3Bi2Br9 (fwhm: 48 nm), and Cs3Sb2Br9 (fwhm: 41 nm).63–65 The wide emission is due to the fact that the excitons in these low dimensional perovskites could be trapped in a state owing to the strong electron–phonon coupling. Surprisingly, tin based perovskites showed some potential in achieving narrow emissions. Recently, a two dimensional PEA2SnI4 structure was synthesized and exhibited a narrow fwhm of 21 nm with the emission wavelength located at 632 nm.66
Another important research topic for lead free perovskites is electroluminescence. Sargent and co-workers reported that by incorporating valeric acid as a coordinator for Sn2+, the improved films and the reduced Sn4+ content within PEA2SnI4 enabled a high external quantum efficiency of 5%, and the operation half-life reached 15 hours with an initial brightness of 20 cd m−2.66 There have also been reports about employing two broadband emissive materials with self-trapped excitons for electroluminescence. For instance, the composite films constructed from CsCu2I3@Cs3Cu2I5 exhibited an ideal white-light emission with cold/warm white-light tuning.67 The as-obtained white LED had a maximum luminance of 145 cd m−2 and an external quantum efficiency of 0.15%. Its CRI value reached a record of 91.6. In addition, Friend and Tan demonstrated tunable near-infrared electroluminescence from MASn(Br1−xIx)3, and the device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3SnI3/F8/Ca/Ag achieved a 945 nm near-infrared emission with a radiance of 3.4 W sr−1 m−2 and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 0.72%.68 Overall, the electroluminescence of lead-free perovskites still lags far behind that of their lead halide counterparts.
4.2 Radiation detection
Benefitting from the presence of heavy atoms, like Bi, Sb, I, Br et al., lead-free perovskites have attracted a lot of attention as radiation detectors, especially X-ray detectors. Principally, there are two kinds of materials for radiation detectors: scintillators and semiconductors, both requiring lead-free perovskites with a high atomic number and density, as well as low intrinsic radioactivity. For scintillators, the target is to achieve a high light yield, fast response speed, good stability against moisture and radiation, and convenient fabrication process. The design strategy is similar as those for light emitting applications, like quantum confinement and decreasing crystal dimensionality. In terms of semiconductor-based radiation detection, the semiconductors should have a high mobility-lifetime product and large resistivity. With respect to materials, it is desired to have indirect band gaps (thus a long carrier lifetime), high mobility and low carrier density (hence high resistivity).

4.2.1 Scintillators. 
Scintillators can convert high energy photons into visible light, which is then captured by photodetectors. The characteristics of STEs make lead-free perovskites nearly perfect scintillators. Considering that the thickness of scintillators is at least hundreds of micrometers or even millimeters, a large stokes shift of STE emitters is a requisite for high light output efficiency. Moreover, compared to traditional scintillators utilizing ion luminescence (Ce3+ and Tb3+), STE emitters are not vulnerable to structural defects, and the afterglow is typically low. One shortcoming of STE scintillators is their generally large band gap, which lowers the theoretical limit of the light yield. Besides, the relatively long luminescence lifetime of these materials makes them not suitable for special circumstances like positron emission tomography (PET) and high energy physics.
In recent years, rapid progress has been made in lead-free perovskite based scintillators, such as, Bmpip2SnBr4, Bmpip2GeBr4 (Bmpip: 1-butyl-1-methylpiperidinium cation; Fig. 8a and b), A2CuX3 (A: Rb, K; X: Cl, Br), and Cs2Ag0.6Na0.4In0.85Bi0.15Cl6.69–73 Upon γ-ray radiation, Cs3Cu2I5 exhibits an excellent energy resolution of 3.4% at 662 keV, and its light yield is 29000 photons per MeV.74 Noteworthily, its afterglow yield upon X-ray radiation is only 0.03% at 10 ms, as shown in Fig. 8c. The performance of Cs2Ag0.6Na0.4In0.85Bi0.15Cl6 was also investigated by Yang and co-workers with an afterglow yield of only 0.1% at 16 μs.73 The weak afterglow makes these materials more suitable for computed tomography and dynamic X-ray imaging (Fig. 8d).75 The further improvements of the scintillation performance rely on the growth of larger single crystals and thick film fabrication.

4.2.2 Semiconductors. 
Semiconductor based radiation detectors directly convert high-energy photons into electrons (holes). A number of lead-free perovskites have been reported for radiation detection, including Cs2AgBiBr6, Cs3Bi2I9, (NH4)3Bi2I9, Rb3Bi2I9, Cs2TeI6, etc.37,76–79 Compared to their lead based counterparts, lead-free perovskites have shown the advantages of high resistivity, heavy composition and low ionic migration. For example, Cs2AgBiBr6 single crystals were demonstrated with a generally higher resistivity (109 to 1011 Ω cm) than MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I; 107 to 109 Ω cm), as shown in Fig. 9b.57 The resistivity for Cs3Bi2I9 single crystals was determined to be 2.79 × 1010 Ω cm.77 The high resistivity can help reduce the shot noise and thermal noise and thus benefit the signal-to-noise ratio at low dose rates. The detection limits for Cs2AgBiBr6, Cs3Bi2I9 and Rb3Bi2I9 were 59.7 nGyair s−1, 130 nGyair s−1 and 13 nGyair s−1, respectively. The presence of heavy atoms like Bi and I guarantees a high X-ray absorption coefficient from the relationship α ∝ Z4/E3, where α is the X-ray attenuation coefficient and E is the X-ray photon energy. Taking (NH4)3Bi2I9 as an example, 0.99 mm thickness of (NH4)3Bi2I9 was enough to attenuate 99% of 50 keV photons, while MAPbBr3 required 2.28 mm (Fig. 9a).78 This high attenuation efficiency ensures the adequate absorption of X-ray photons with a reduced material thickness, thus enabling the charge carriers to be collected more easily.

More importantly, the ionic migration in lead-free perovskites is usually much lower than that in lead halide perovskites, which is possibly due to the low trap density and high ionic migration barriers for halide vacancies in lead free perovskites. Lately, Zhang and co-workers recorded the operational stability of a MA3Bi2I9 wafer based X-ray detector.80 Under a constant bias field of 2000 V cm−1 for 2500 s, the baseline and photocurrent output of the detector were still stable (Fig. 9d). The ionic migration of 0D (MA3Bi2I9), 2D ((PEA)2PbI4) and 3D (MAPbI3) perovskite single crystals was compared by Liu and co-workers.81 The dark current drift of the 0D MA3Bi2I9 single crystal detector is 5.0 × 1010 nA cm−1 s−1 V−1 under a bias voltage of 10 V, orders of magnitude lower than that of the 3D MAPbI3 SC (2.0 × 10−3 nA cm−1 s−1 V−1) and 2D (PEA)2PbI4 (1.9 × 10−8 nA cm−1 s−1 V−1) (Fig. 9c). They also theoretically calculated the migration barriers of halide vacancies for MA3Bi2I9, (PEA)2PbI4 and 3D MAPbI3 to be 1.18 eV, 0.85 eV and 0.54 eV, respectively, confirming the lower ionic migration of MA3Bi2I9.
The remaining challenge for lead-free perovskites is the low carrier mobility compared to three-dimensional metal halides. The hole mobilities of Cs3Bi2I9 and Cs3Sb2I9 are only 1.7 and 0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.44 Such low carrier mobility severely restricts their carrier mobility-lifetime product, which indicates the distance that the carriers could transit per unit electric field before annihilation. The limited mobility-lifetime product makes these materials hard for single photon detection of alpha particles or gamma rays. Recently, Kanatzidis and co-workers reported the full width at half maximum for detecting 241Am @ 5.49 MeV as large as 32%, and the device should be biased at a high voltage of 560 V, as shown in Fig. 9e.40 Further improvement over the mobility-lifetime product is in urgent demand.

5. Conclusions
In summary, we have reviewed the structure–property relationship of lead-free perovskites and their variants, as well as their application for light emitting and radiation detection. To successfully replace the lead element, we have to gain a deep insight into the role of Pb in perovskites (lone-pair Pb 6s2 electrons, empty Pb 6p, and the large size and heavy mass result in strong spin–orbit coupling). Therefore, metal cations with lone-pair s orbitals, including In+, Tl+, Ge2+, Sn2+, Bi3+ and Sb3+, are promising candidates to substitute Pb2+. As the conduction band minimum (CBM) is mainly composed of unoccupied metal np0 states and the valence band maximum (VBM) consists of occupied ns2 states, the energy levels of the VBM (ns2 states) and CBM (np0 states) of the above metals increase in the order Bi < Sb < Pb < Sn < Tl < In. From this view, both the band gaps and carrier mobility of these materials could be predicted. Additionally, the valence states and ionic radius of these metal ions together determine their crystal structure and the decomposition energy. For specific applications, the crystal structure should be engineered. For example, for direct radiation detection, the materials should exhibit high crystal dimensionality and the carrier mobility should be enhanced for carrier extraction. On the other hand, for luminescence applications (phosphors and scintillators), it is necessary to tailor perovskite derivatives into low crystal dimensionality or decrease the size of the crystals to involve the quantum confinement effect. Structural descriptors for given structures (2D A3B2X9, 3D perovskites and double perovskites) could be used to guide the material design, but a comprehensively systematic descriptor was required for all lead-free perovskites. Another important parameter of lead-free perovskites is the minority carrier lifetime, where a long lifetime is beneficial for efficient carrier extraction in solar cells and photodetectors, while a short lifetime is demanded for light emitting devices. The typical characters of parity-forbidden transition (e.g. Cs2AgInCl6), indirect transition (e.g. Cs2AgBiBr6) and formation of self-trapped excitons (e.g. Cs3Bi2Br9) all will prolong the carrier lifetime. controlling the luminescence lifetime remains a big challenge in this field. Preliminary results indicate that STEs should be related to the structural distortions, but no principles could guide how to eliminate these distortions.
For applications, the emission and electronic properties of perovskites make them suitable for phosphors and scintillators, as well as electroluminescence devices and semiconductor radiation detectors. The progress is rapid for phosphors and scintillators, considering the versatile synthetic process and quick feedback from luminescence characterization. However, their performance still lags far behind that of commercial products. For example, the emission fwhm of lead-free perovskites is too large (>40 nm, ideal < 20 nm) for high color purity display applications; for illumination applications, the phosphors do not have an enough CRI value (>80), and the operational stability especially under UV light and thermal treatment (>85 °C) is also a concern, which has rarely been reported. As scintillators, the light yield values should be strictly evaluated according to pulse height spectroscopy.
On the other hand, many researchers have begun to apply lead-free perovskites to electronic devices (EL, semiconductor detectors). However, the fabrication procedure is not well developed, considering the inorganic compositions and low solubility of lead-free perovskites. Further attempts towards mixed solvent utilization, vacuum evaporation and sputtering evaporation are recommended to solve this problem. The low carrier mobility of lead-free perovskites is also a challenge for electronic devices, which restricts the carrier injection efficiency in electroluminescence devices and carrier extraction in semiconductor detectors. More strategies, such as band structure engineering, forming alloys with lead halide perovskites, and addition of conduction dopants (graphene, carbon nanotubes, etc.), should be encouraged to increase the carrier mobility. Overall, we believe that lead-free perovskites have demonstrated exciting results in the field of light emission and radiation detection, and more fundamental research will lead us to a bright future in practical applications.
