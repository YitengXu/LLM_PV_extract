    , Accepted 22nd June 2016First published on 23rd June 2016AbstractCharge recombination losses are primarily responsible for the modest photovoltaic performance of quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Charge recombination occurring at the photoanode/electrolyte interface contributes significant energy loss in QDSC devices. Herein, a facile method to reduce the recombination loss by modifying the polysulfide electrolyte with the addition of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) as an efficient and general additive was introduced. It was found that the PVP modified polysulfide electrolyte could significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs, especially the open-circuit voltage and fill factor. In addition, the PVP modified electrolyte is widely applicable to various QD sensitizer based systems. Impedance spectroscopy and open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements reveal that the charge recombination processes occurring at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interfaces were remarkably inhibited using the PVP modified electrolyte. The average power conversion efficiency (PCE) was improved remarkably by 9% and a champion PCE of 9.77% was obtained with 20 wt% PVP in the polysulfide electrolyte for CdSexTe1−x based QDSCs. Moreover, the stability of the constructed QDSCs was also improved by employing the PVP modified polysulfide electrolyte.
1. Introduction
As a direct way to harness solar energy, photovoltaic cells have attracted great interest from both governments and researchers all over the world. Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs), which are perceived to be a promising candidate for next generation solar cells, have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to various advantages such as high extinction coefficients, facile tunable band gaps and high theoretical efficiency.1–6 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of QDSCs have made a remarkable progress in the past five years, increasing rapidly from 5% to over 11%.7–12 The rapid evolution of QDSCs in recent years mainly relies on the optimization of the photoanode, including the development of superior QD sensitizers with narrow band gaps and suitable conduction band edges as well as efficient interface engineering to control the charge recombination process. At present, the short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of QDSCs (∼25 mA cm−2) is comparable to that of other kinds of emerging solar cells (including dye sensitized solar cells, DSCs and perovskite solar cells), while there is still much room for further improvement in the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of QDSCs, which is determined mainly by the energy difference between the electron Fermi energy in TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte.13,14
The electrolyte redox couple performs the function of charge transfer between the photoanode and counter electrode as well as regeneration of the oxidized QD sensitizer in a QDSC device. The polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) redox couple electrolyte is commonly used in QDSCs since the chalcogenide QD sensitizers can be stable in it. Compared to the commonly used redox couple I−/I3− in DSCs, the polysulfide electrolyte presents an undesirable high redox potential, thus resulting in a relatively low Voc in the QDSC system.15,16 To overcome this shortcoming, much effort has been made by developing new kinds of redox couple electrolyte systems in QDSCs. These include I−/I3−,17 Co2+/3+ complexes,18,19 and organic redox couples.20–23 Regretfully, cadmium chalcogenide QD sensitizers can hardly survive in these electrolyte systems and the lifetime of the resultant cell devices is limited.
Besides exploring new kinds of redox couples, another efficient way to improve the electrochemical properties of electrolytes is the use of additives.24 In DSCs, various additives, such as 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN), have been widely used in the I−/I3− electrolyte. It has been demonstrated that these additives can be adsorbed on the surface of the TiO2 substrate and suppress the charge recombination by passivating the surface trap states of TiO2.25 Consequently, Voc and PCE of the resultant cell devices can be improved remarkably.25–27 On the other hand, the redox potential of the I−/I3− redox couple can also be modified by the additives since they may complex with iodine in the electrolyte, thereby altering the redox potential of the electrolyte and affecting the Voc of cell devices.26 Nevertheless, few reports focus on the modification of polysulfide electrolytes in QDSCs. Recently, Zhong et al. reported a modified polysulfide electrolyte with the use of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as an additive and a remarkable enhancement in PCE from 5.80% to 6.74% was observed for CdSe based QDSCs.28 It was demonstrated that the PEG additive can serve as a protective layer over photoanodes by the steric hindrance effect, consequently retarding the unwanted charge recombination and thus improving the Voc and PCE of the solar cells. However, this kind of additive has no beneficial effect on QDSCs based on other QD sensitizers, such as CdSexTe1−x or CuInSe2 QDs. Therefore, it is still a great challenge to explore an efficient and general additive to modify the polysulfide electrolyte and improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs based on the state-of-the-art QD sensitizers.
Being a functional polymer, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) has attracted special interest due to its distinguished advantages such as good environmental stability, easy processability and moderate electrical conductivity.29–31 As an amphiphilic surfactant, PVP can be used as a capping ligand to stabilize colloidal nanocrystals and render them dispersible in both water and organic solvents.32,33 What's more, it is also demonstrated that the PVP molecule is capable of passivating the surface defects of QDs and improve the stability of QDs under photoactivation.34 Herein, an efficient way to modify the polysulfide electrolyte with use of PVP as an additive is presented. It was found that the addition of PVP to the polysulfide electrolyte can significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs, especially the Voc and FF. Moreover, unlike other additives in QDSCs, the PVP modified electrolyte is compatible with various QD sensitizers including CdSe, CdSexTe1−x, and Zn–Cu–In–Se (ZCISe) QDs, which have been commonly used in the recent years and exhibit the best photovoltaic performance. PVP can act as a barrier layer around the photoanode to passivate the surface defects of both TiO2 and QDs and suppresses charge recombination from the photoanode to the electrolyte. Experimental results show that the charge recombination processes occurring at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interfaces were remarkably inhibited using the PVP modified electrolyte. Consequently, the average PCE was improved by 9% and a champion PCE of 9.77% was achieved for CdSexTe1−x based solar cells under AM 1.5G full one sun illumination. Furthermore, the stability of the constructed solar cell was also improved by employing PVP as an additive in the polysulfide electrolyte.
2. Experimental section
Materials
Oleic acid (90%), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA, 98%) and thioglycolic acid (TGA, 97%) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Oleylamine (OAm, 95%), 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%), trioctylphosphine (TOP, 90%), cadmium oxide (CdO, 99.99%), selenium powder (200 mesh, 99.99%), and tellurium powder (200 mesh, 99.99%) were purchased from Aldrich. Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) with different molecular weights were obtained from Aladdin China. All reagents were used as received without further treatment.
QD synthesis and photoanode preparation
The syntheses of CdSe, CdSe0.65Te0.35 (simplified as CdSeTe henceforth) and ZCISe QDs, as well as the ligand exchange process to obtain water-soluble QDs are described in our previous work.10–12,35 TiO2 film electrodes with a 9.0 μm-thick transparent layer and a 6.0 μm-thick light scattering layer over F:SnO2-coated (FTO, 8 Ω square−1) glass substrates were prepared according to the literature method.36 It is noted that the TiO2 film electrodes for ZCISe QDSCs are composed of a 20.0 μm transparent layer and 6.0 μm light scattering layer. After the deposition of QDs on TiO2 film, the electrodes were coated with an am-TiO2 passivating layer by immersing into a TiCl4 aqueous solution (containing 0.02 M TiCl4 and 0.01 M TGA) for 30 min at 40 °C.10 After that, the electrodes were treated with 4 cycles of ZnS by dipping into 0.1 M Zn(OAc)2 and 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solutions for 1 min per dip alternately and then coated with a SiO2 layer by immersing in 0.01 M tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) solution at 35 °C for 2 h followed by rinsing with ethanol.11 It is noted that the am-TiO2 and SiO2 treatments were not carried out for ZCISe based QDSCs and the ZnS treatment was carried out for 6 cycles.12
Cell fabrication
Sandwich configuration cells were constructed by assembling the TiO2 film photoanode with a Cu2−xS/FTO counter electrode using a 60 μm-thick Surlyn ring (DuPont) and filling the space with the electrolyte. The Cu2−xS/FTO counter electrode was prepared according to the literature method.37 The modified electrolyte was prepared by mixing a certain amount of PVP with 10.0 g of traditional polysulfide electrolyte containing 2.0 M Na2S, 2.0 M S and 0.2 M KCl in aqueous solution. Under each condition, five cells were prepared and tested in parallel.
Characterization
Current–voltage curves (J–V curves) of the cell devices were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination of simulated AM 1.5G solar light (Oriel, Model no. 94022A) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (1 full sun). The photoactive area was 0.235 cm2 defined by a metal mask. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was obtained using a Keithley 2000 multimeter under illumination with a 300 W tungsten lamp with a Spectral Product DK240 monochromator. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium). EIS was measured under dark conditions at different forward bias values ranging from −0.4 V to −0.65 V applying a 20 mV AC sinusoidal signal over the constant applied bias with the frequency ranging from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. In OCVD measurements, samples were illuminated by a white LED with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and the dependence of photovoltage on time was recorded after switching-off the light.
3. Results and discussion
Photovoltaic performance
QDSCs based on CdSe, CdSeTe and ZCISe QD sensitizers were constructed according to literature methods.11,12,35 PVP with different molecular weights, including PVP-8000, PVP-24000 and PVP-58000 was used as the additive in the polysulfide electrolyte. It was found that the PVP-8000 based cell showed the best performance due to the better solubility of PVP-8000 in the polysulfide electrolyte. Therefore, PVP-8000 was employed as the electrolyte additive for further investigation. The traditional polysulfide electrolyte (consisting of 2.0 M Na2S, 2.0 M S, 0.2 M KCl) and the modified electrolytes with addition of PVP-8000 with various mass fractions (0, 10%, 15% and 20%) were prepared. Sandwich-type cell devices were fabricated with the use of Cu2−xS/FTO as the counter electrode and five cells were prepared and tested in parallel for each condition. It is noted that the upper limit of mass fraction of PVP-8000 in the polysulfide electrolyte is about 20%; further increase of the PVP concentration is infeasible owing to the limited solubility of PVP in the polysulfide electrolyte.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of CdSeTe based champion QDSCs under AM 1.5G full one sun illumination with various PVP concentrations are shown in Fig. 1a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the Jsc values are almost identical for all conditions, while both the Voc and FF values increase gradually with the increase of PVP concentration. IPCE curves in Fig. 1b show a slight variation for different PVP amounts in the electrolyte. This result is consistent with the Jsc observation. The cell based on 20% PVP in the polysulfide electrolyte displays the best photovoltaic performance with an average PCE of 9.68% and a champion PCE of 9.77% (Jsc = 20.49 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.723 V, FF = 0.660), which is about 10% higher than that of the reference cells without the PVP additive in the electrolyte. The individual J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters are displayed in Fig. S1 and Table S1 (ESI†). For clarity, the trends of individual photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc and FF) of the solar cells with different PVP concentrations are presented in Fig. 1c and d. It is visualized that the improved PCE can be mainly ascribed to the considerably increased Voc and FF values. Herein, it is worth noting that most of the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic additives in DSCs decrease the Jsc, while the PVP additive has negligible influence on the Jsc value in our case.38

In our previous work, it was found that the modified electrolyte using the PEG additive has only a positive effect on the CdSe QD based system. Herein, it is highlighted that the PVP modified electrolyte is applicable to various QD sensitizers that are commonly used in QDSCs. For instance, in CdSe based QDSCs, the average PCE was improved from 6.75% to 7.40% with the use of 20 wt% PVP in the polysulfide electrolyte. A similar positive result was also found for ZCISe QDs with a PCE improvement from 8.69% to 9.19%. The photovoltaic parameters for CdSe and ZCISe based QDSCs are shown in Table 1. For clarity, the average PCE values together with deviation for various types of QDs based QDSCs with traditional and PVP modified electrolytes are displayed in Fig. 1e. It is visualized that the addition of PVP to the electrolyte contributes to a considerable increase in the PCE for various systems. Detailed J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters for CdSe and ZCISe based QDSCs are available in Fig. S2 and S3 and Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†). Hence, modification of the polysulfide electrolyte using PVP as an additive is a promising strategy for further improvement of QDSCs benefiting from its superior photovoltaic performance and wide application range.
Impedance spectroscopy
To explore the effect of the PVP additive in the polysulfide electrolyte on the interfacial charge transfer characteristics in the constructed QDSCs, impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements were carried out for the CdSeTe based cell devices containing different PVP concentrations in the polysulfide electrolyte. The cells were measured under dark conditions at forward bias ranging from −0.4 to −0.65 V and the IS parameters were extracted with a standard simulation circuit.39–41 The extracted chemical capacitance Cμ and recombination resistance Rrec at different applied voltages (Vapp) are presented in Fig. 2a and b. The similar Cμ values obtained from the devices with different PVP concentrations in the electrolyte revealed that the PVP additive did not change the conduction band edge of the TiO2 matrix. However, it was found that the Rrec values were significantly influenced by the PVP additive as shown in Fig. 2b. It is well known that the Rrec value at moderate frequencies is inversely proportional to the charge recombination rate at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. Compared to the cells with the traditional reference electrolyte without PVP, the addition of PVP to the electrolyte considerably improved the Rrec values, indicating that the charge recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface was remarkably suppressed. With increase of the PVP concentrations, the Rrec values increased gradually. The highest Rrec was observed for the cells with 20 wt% PVP, which is consistent with the J–V measurement.

For clarity, Fig. 2d displays a direct comparison of Nyquist plots for the cells with different PVP concentrations in the electrolyte at a forward bias of −0.65 V, which is close to the Voc of the cells. The extracted IS parameters are listed in Table S4 (ESI†). It is observed that the Rrec value for the cell with 20 wt% PVP (171.1 Ω cm2) is 1.5-fold higher than the reference cell without the PVP additive (113.0 Ω cm2). In addition, the calculated electron lifetime (τn = Rrec × Cμ) of the cell with the 20 wt% PVP additive was about 2-fold longer than that of the reference cell. The dark current of a QDSC can also be considered as a reflection of the degree of the charge recombination process. As shown in Fig. 2c, the addition of PVP to the polysulfide electrolyte can significantly decrease the dark current, implying decreased charge recombination. These results reveal that the improved photovoltaic performance can be largely ascribed to the inhibited charge recombination process at the photoanode/electrolyte interface with the addition of PVP in the electrolyte. Previous studies on DSCs have shown that part of the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic additives in I−/I3− can markedly improve the solar cell performance, arising from passivating of the photoanode surface or the dipole moment.25–27,42 Similarly, the PVP additive in the electrolyte as a co-absorber can act as an organic passivating layer, reducing the charge recombination losses through surface defects or with oxidation species in the electrolyte.
Open-circuit voltage-decay measurement
Open-circuit voltage-decay (OCVD) analysis, which is another valid method to monitor the charge recombination process and calculate the electron lifetime from the Voc decay information, was used to further analyze the electron recombination processes of cells with different PVP additives in the electrolyte.43,44 The cells were illuminated by a white LED (100 mW cm−2) to get to a steady Voc and then the transient change of the voltage was recorded after turning off the illumination. The decay curves are shown in Fig. 3a. Apparently, the voltage decay rates for the cells with the polysulfide electrolyte containing PVP additives were much slower than those of the reference cell without the PVP additive. Meanwhile, the electron lifetime can be calculated by the equation τn = −(kBT/e)(dVoc/dt)−1, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and e is the electronic charge.28 As shown in Fig. 3b, the electron lifetime of cells using the PVP modified polysulfide electrolyte was obviously longer than that of the cell without the PVP additive over the whole range of voltage conditions. The prolonged electron lifetime indicates that the photo-generated electrons can survive for a longer time without being captured.45–47 The OCVD results are in good agreement with the IS measurement and further demonstrate that an effective inhibition of charge recombination can be achieved with the addition of PVP in the polysulfide electrolyte.

Stability test
The long term stability of a photovoltaic device is a crucial factor for its commercial application.48 The PCE of QDSCs has made great progress in recent years, while the stability of QDSCs is far from satisfactory. The instability of QDSCs is partially due to the photo-corrosion of QDs under the illumination of sunlight. Nevertheless, PVP has been used as the stabilizer to prevent the photo-corrosion of QDs.49,50 Therefore, employing PVP as an additive in a polysulfide electrolyte shows potential to improve the stability of QDSCs. To confirm this expectation, the stability test of the cells with 20 wt% PVP and without PVP in the polysulfide electrolyte was carried out. The cells were tested every 12 hours and stored under ambient conditions. As expected, the addition of PVP to the polysulfide electrolyte is favorable for the improvement of cell stability. The normalized PCEs of the cells with temporal variation are displayed in Fig. 4. It is observed that the PCE of the reference cell without PVP addition began to decline after 5 h and reached about 50% of the initial value in a course of 75 h, while the cell containing 20 wt% PVP in the electrolyte displayed nearly the best performance in the initial 30 h, and retained more than 85% of the initial values after 75 h. The improved cell stability can be ascribed to the protection effect of the PVP molecules as an organic shell, preventing the photo-corrosion of QDs under the illumination of sunlight.

4. Conclusions
Herein, an efficient and general way to modify the polysulfide electrolyte with the use of PVP as an additive was presented. It was demonstrated that the addition of PVP in the polysulfide electrolyte can significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs, especially the Voc and FF values, as well as the stability of the resultant solar cells. Furthermore, the PVP modified electrolyte was applicable to various QD sensitizers based QDSCs. EIS and OCVD measurements revealed that the charge recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface was remarkably inhibited with the addition of PVP to the polysulfide electrolyte. The average PCE of CdSeTe based QDSCs was improved by 9% and a champion PCE of 9.77% was achieved. This work provides a new approach to boost the PCE of QDSCs through the suitable modification of the commonly used polysulfide electrolyte.
