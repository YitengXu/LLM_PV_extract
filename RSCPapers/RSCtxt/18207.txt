Tuning the semiconductor morphology or straightforward electronic doping have been developed for the performance enhancement of OSCs. However, it has not been examined if electronic doping offers more scope for OSC improvement than morphology modification, and whether electronic doping can compensate for imperfect morphology-induced defects. Herein, we prepare polymer films with distinct morphologies in terms of molecular orientation and crystallinity. Maintaining the pre-controlled morphologies in planar heterojunction (PHJ) devices, we find that doping is more effective in the original poor-performing device with less crystalline face-on orientation. Density function theory (DFT) calculations show the roles of dopant–polymer donor electrostatic interactions on the dopant arrangement geometry and energy landscape shift, in which the former is considered the dominant cause for efficient doping in the face-on orientation. This work emphasizes the importance of the design of matched charge–quadrupole interaction between the dopant and donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymer to achieve high doping efficiency. It also provides answers to the above question that doping might be able to alleviate the imperfect morphology-induced performance loss in OSCs.
Supported by the continued optimization of material structure and device architecture, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has risen over 19%.1 The success of OSCs is based on the concept of the heterojunction, which helps overcome the binding energy of Frenkel excitons to produce free carriers under irradiation. The generation of free carriers in OCSs is a multi-step process, which is initiated by the charge transfer (CT) state formation at the heterojunction.2–4 The CT excitons will then evolve to the desired charge separated (CS) state or decay to the ground state (GS).5,6 There are two widely accepted models to explain the photo-charge generation at the donor/acceptor (D/A) heterojunction, namely, the Marcus model and the Onsager–Braun model. Under the framework of Marcus theory, the yield of CT excitons is determined by the energy difference between the singlet state and the CT state, the reorganization energy, and the strength of electronic coupling.7–9 The Marcus model is able to predict the ultrafast timescale of exciton splitting at the heterojunction,9–11 and it has been further developed as a common tool for fitting the CT state position to analyse the voltage loss in OSCs.12–14 Compared with the semi-classical Marcus model, the Onsager–Braun model is more applicable for understanding the photovoltaic mechanism on a device level. The Onsager–Braun model depicts the yield of photogenerated carriers based on the rate balance between the CT state dissociation and geminate recombination within a finite CT state lifetime. According to it, the yield of free carriers is a function of the electric field, the activation energy, and the temperature.15,16 Inspired by these theoretical models, factors such as the offset of the energy landscape,17–19 quantum delocalization,20,21 entropy gain,22,23 energetic disorder,23,24 and interfacial electric field25,26 have been proposed to facilitate efficient photo-charge generation. Hence, developing practical methodologies to optimize the semiconducting parameters at the D/A heterojunction provides new space for performance improvement in OSCs.
Beyond the single molecular electronic structure, the optoelectronic properties of photovoltaic materials also depend on the morphology at the D/A heterojunction.27,28 The morphology at the D/A heterojunction includes two aspects: the relative molecular orientation and the degree of molecule arrangement. Due to the π-conjugated structure of organic semiconductors, the relative molecular orientation at the D/A heterojunction is categorized into face-to-face, edge-to-face, and edge-to-edge configurations. The interfacial molecular orientation influences the exciton dissociation probability by changing the CT state energy,29,30 the electronic coupling,29 and the interfacial dipole.31,32 In fullerene-contained OSC devices, the face-to-face configuration outweighs the edge-to-face configuration.33,34 The degree of molecule arrangement, namely order and disorder, is another key morphological factor that determines the CT exciton dissociation. The ordered D or A aggregates delocalize the manifold of CT states, leading to a reduction in the Coulomb binding energy.35,36 Additionally, a thin mixed disorder region (usually <10 nm) enlarges the bandgap, thus forming an electric field to facilitate CT exciton dissociation.37,38 It is concluded that the optimal local morphology at the D/A heterojunction constitutes a disordered thin layer sandwiched between the ordered pure D and A phases.39 Compared with local morphology tuning, electronic doping is a more direct method to optimize the semiconducting properties of organic photovoltaic materials. Taking p-type doping as an example, it occurs via electron transfer from the organic semiconductor to the dopant, which is the same as the definition in inorganic semiconductors. Molecular doping changes the carrier density by orders of magnitude and correspondingly shifts the Fermi level (EF). The benefits of molecular doping on OSC performance have been previously ascribed to the modified semiconductor–electrode junction,40,41 filled trap-states,42,43 suppressed recombination,44,45 enhanced charge transport,46,47 and optimized morphology.48,49 Very recently, we reported the heterojunction doping effect in a planar PHJ model device.43,44,50,51 The heterojunction doping facilitates exciton splitting for two reasons: first, heterojunction doping can enhance the built-in potential in the device, which is good for both free carrier generation and collection; second, heterojunction doping provides more vacancies for charge transfer by increasing the density of states (DOS), thus increasing the generation yield of free carriers via entropy gain.52 Fascinated by these advantages, we further conducted heterojunction doping in OSC material systems with negligible driving force for exciton splitting. The simultaneous enhancement of short-circuit current (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) demonstrates its promising application in solving the long-standing JSC–VOC compromise in OSC devices.52
Herein, we compare two strategies for tuning the semiconducting properties of organic photovoltaic materials in model PHJ devices to examine whether doping can alleviate the electronic defects induced by the imperfect heterojunction morphology. We fabricated the PHJ devices by floating the polymer poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) film on water and sequentially sticking it onto the pre-coated 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) layer, where we can independently change the PBDB-T morphology without any disturbance to ITIC. Both the molecular orientation and crystallinity of the PBDB-T films changed when changing the processing solvent from chlorobenzene (CB) to toluene (TL). The polymer PBDB-T film evolves from the face-on dominant orientation to edge-on with enhanced crystallinity. Interestingly, though the device manufactured by TL is better than that obtained from CB, electronic doping improves the CB device more significantly than the TL device. DFT simulation reveals that the dopant arrangement with respect to the D moiety of the PBDB-T backbone rather than the energy landscape position determines the validity of heterojunction doping on different local morphologies. The study promisingly points out that electronic doping is able to compensate for the morphological imperfections at the D/A heterojunction and makes further performance improvements based on the optimized morphology.
The molecular structures of PBDB-T and ITIC are shown in Fig. 1a. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of morphology control and electronic doping on improving the photovoltaic performance. Morphology control is achieved by processing the PBDB-T film from two solvents. Researchers have found that TL leads to edge-on dominant orientation in the polymer, while it has been identified that PBDB-T presents mainly face-on orientation when using CB as the solvent.53,54 Morphology control was initially confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Fig. S1 in ESI†). The surface roughness slightly increases from 1.31 nm to 1.76 nm with larger particle size when changing the solvent from CB to TL. The polymer orientation and crystallinity are further examined by grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS, Fig. 1b and c, Fig. S2 in ESI†). The two-dimensional patterns show that the face-on orientation dominates the CB-processed PBDB-T film, while the edge-on orientation is more favoured in the TL-processed sample. Qualitative polar angle analysis shows a ratio of 64:36 face-on:edge-on orientation when casting from CB. When casting from TL, the PBDB-T film shows a ratio of 40:60 face-on:edge-on orientation (Fig. 1d and Fig. S3 in ESI†). In addition to providing information about the molecular orientation, the GIWAXS images also show that the edge-on-dominated PBDB-T film is more ordered than the face-on film (Fig. 1e). For the CB-processed PBDB-T film, the coherence length of the (100) peak at 0.33 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction is 61.5 Å, which is smaller than the 77.5 Å of the TL-processed film. The coherence length associated with the π–π stacking at 1.71 Å−1 in the CB- and TL-processed PBDB-T films are 18.7 Å and 11.6 Å, respectively. The opposite order of the (100) and (010) peaks indicates that TL facilitates polymer crystallization along the lamellar stacking direction, which favours the associated edge-on orientation. The π–π stacking behaviour in solution determines the solid morphology in PBDB-T film. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the solution absorption spectrum varies from CB to TL. The ratio of the 0−0 and 0−1 peak intensity reduces in TL, indicating enhanced H-type aggregation. For conjugated polymers, H-type aggregation forms when the chains interact by π–π stacking. We assume that the polymer orientation in the solid film is determined by the surface ratio of the alkyl chain to π-stacking zones. The higher the surface ratio, the easier the formation of the edge-on orientation. Considering that H-type aggregation in solution reduces the outer surface of π-conjugated planes, it increases the surface ratio of the alkyl chain to π-stacking zones. Therefore, the TL-processed PBDB-T film exhibits higher crystalline morphology with more edge-on orientation than that processed from CB. We finally evaluated the effect of morphology variation on the polymer's highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) level. Probed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), the HOMO level of PBDB-T only slightly shifts from −4.85 eV to −4.82 eV when changing the solvent from CB to TL (Fig. 1f). The results are consistent with previous reports by the Diao group,55 and the subtle difference of the HOMO positions has little impact on the effectiveness of p-type doping and exciton dissociation abilities.

We then fabricated the PHJ devices (Fig. S5 in ESI†) to investigate the doping effect based on the varying polymer morphologies. A commercial p-type dopant 1,3,4,5,7,8-hexafluorotetracyanonaphthoquinodimethane (F6TCNNQ) was chosen due to its energy level position, orthogonal solubility to PBDB-T, and good planarity. First, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of F6TCNNQ is −5.60 eV, which is lower than the HOMO level of PBDB-T. Therefore, it is promising to p-dope the polymer via electron transfer from PBDB-T to the dopant. Secondly, F6TCNNQ has good solubility in polar solvents like ethanol and tetrahydrofuran. Sequentially coating it onto PBDB-T will not disturb the polymer layer. Thirdly, F6TCNNQ has good planarity, which is different from the bulky dopants with deep LUMO levels. This helps it to avoid changing the optical distribution and distance between the donor and acceptor when placed at the heterojunction. ITIC is used as the acceptor material to pair with PBDB-T.56 The ITIC molecules adopt the face-on orientation (Fig. S6 in ESI†). Despite the TL-processed PHJ device displaying a higher JSC of 2.30 mA cm−2 than the CB-processed device, p-type doping boosts the JSC to 2.51 mA cm−2 in the CB-processed device, producing the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.43%, compared to the value of 1.12% in the optimized morphological device (Fig. 2a and b, Table 1). The JSC improvement is verified by the integrated external quantum efficiency (EQE) intensity, as shown in Fig. 2c and Table 1. Together with the JSC increment, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) shows a slight growth from 0.86 V to 0.87 V in the CB-processed device and from 0.85 V to 0.86 V in the TL-processed device. We notice that the doping-induced PCE increment is linked to the fraction of the face-on orientation in the PBDB-T film. The more the proportion of the face-on polymer, the more effective the electronic doping at the PBDB-T/ITIC heterojunction. We will further expound on this topic in the simulation section.

The JSC is proportional to the exciton dissociation probability, which is closely related to the exciton dissociation rate kd. Under the framework of Marcus theory, kd ∼ exp(ΔG)/kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. According to recently published results, ΔG correlates with the electron transfer process between the singlet state of ITIC and the CT state at the heterojunction (Fig. 2d).57 This can be probed by fitting the temperature-dependent ITIC photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the bilayer films, I(T) = I0/[1 + A exp(−ΔG/kT)], where I0 denotes the PL intensity at 0 K. Linear fitting the PL intensity on the semi-logarithmic scale of temperature, the ΔG values are respectively 96.5 meV and 61.8 meV for the control and heterojunction-doped CB-processed devices (Fig. 2e and Fig. S7 in ESI†). A lower ΔG accelerates the kd by about 3.8 times, which indicates that the main origin of the JSC increment is the enhanced exciton dissociation at the heterojunction. In comparison, the ΔG values slightly reduce from 88.7 meV to 83.0 meV after doping in the TL-processed PBDB-T devices (Fig. S8 and S9 in ESI†), leading to a kd increment of merely 1.3 times. The VOC slopes under various light intensities on the semi-logarithmic scale were plotted to characterize the trap-assisted recombination at PBDB-T(CB)/ITIC (Fig. 2f). The reduced VOC slope from 1.79kT/q to 1.56kT/q is consistent with the doping-induced trap-filling that alleviates the JSC loss at the heterojunction.42,52 In agreement with the lower performance improvement in PHJ devices, doping at the PBDB-T(TL)/ITIC heterojunction slightly decreases the VOC slope from 1.70kT/q to 1.63kT/q (Fig. S10 in ESI†).
To understand the effect of electronic doping of the non-optimized heterojunction morphology on the VOC increment, we studied the energy loss using the routine method with values of the photovoltaic bandgap EPVg, CT state and electroluminescence EQE (EQEEL). First, p-doping at the PBDB-T(CB)/ITIC heterojunction does not change the EPVg, and maintains a constant value of 1.631 eV (Fig. S11 in ESI†). The CT state position slightly shifts upwards from 1.603 eV to 1.609 eV after doping (Fig. 2g and Fig. S12 in ESI†). The non-radiative voltage loss (ΔVnon-rad) is calculated by kT·EQEEL/q (Fig. 2h). After evaluating the three parts of energy loss in PHJ devices, we conclude that the VOC enhancement after p-type doping is due to the reduction in non-radiative recombination from 0.283 eV to 0.269 eV (Fig. 2i). Therefore, we assume that the slight VOC increment is due to the doping-filled traps based on our recent publications.52
Since the above results indicate a significant influence of the dopant on the photovoltaic performance of PBDB-T, we performed theoretical investigations to get a deeper insight into the doping effectiveness of the two polymer orientations. We performed DFT calculations to obtain the polymer–dopant geometrical structure and predict the energy landscape change with the consideration of quadrupole components based on the optimized geometries. The dimer structures in the gas phase are presented in Fig. 3a and b and Fig. S13 in ESI.† When adopting the face-on orientation, F6TCNNQ is close to the D moiety of PBDB-T. In comparison, the p-type dopant approaches the A moiety along the side-chain direction when the polymer takes the edge-on orientation. A previous report has demonstrated that the A moiety is inactive for p-type doping,58 and hence the spatial arrangement of the dopant with respect to the PBDB-T repeat unit might be the cause for the inefficient doping effect when adopting the edge-on orientation. Besides the polymer–dopant structure, the relative positions of the polymer–dopant energy landscapes may influence the doping efficiency. It has been reported that the electrostatic charge–quadrupole interaction significantly alters the frontier orbital levels, hence determining the intermolecular charge transfer.59,60 To investigate the influence of quadrupole components, we first calculated the electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution of PBDB-T and F6TCNNQ (Fig. 3c) using DFT calculations at the level of ωB97XD/6-311G(d,p)–6-31G(d)–LanL2DZ (see details in ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3c, the iso-surfaces of F6TCNNQ are negative, while the ESP patterns of PBDB-T show a positive distribution upon the backbone. The opposite polarity of the charge distribution between F6TCNNQ and PBDB-T suggest electrostatic interaction. We further calculated the quadrupole moments of F6TCNNQ in each dimension, where the stronger and negative value of Q3 well explains the favoured dimer structure shown in Fig. 3a. Due to the doping effectiveness of F6TCNNQ, energy shifts occur in both the ionization potential (IP) of PBDB-T and the electron affinity (EA) of F6TCNNQ (Fig. 3d and Fig. S14 in ESI†). However, the relatively large energy offset between IPPBDB-T and EAF6TCNNQ in the face-to-face dimer structure indicates a poor extent of charge transfer. Therefore, the spatial arrangement of F6TCNNQ with respect to the acceptor moiety outperforms the unfavourable charge–quadrupole interaction, producing a stronger heterojunction doping effect in the molecular packing mode of the face-on orientation.

(d) Corresponding scheme of the energy level changes for the pure film and PBDB-T/F6TCNNQ complex films. 
In summary, tuning the electronic property at the D/A heterojunction is expected to enhance the photovoltaic performance in general. Although electronic doping is a straightforward method to do so, comparing it with the commonly used morphology modification has not been realized yet. We prepared two polymer films varying in molecular orientation and crystallinity. Stacking the distinct polymer films on an acceptor layer, we fabricated PHJ model devices. We demonstrate that heterojunction doping is more efficient in devices with a higher extent of face-on orientation, although the pristine device exhibits worse photovoltaic performance than that with a higher extent of edge-on orientation. DFT calculations reveal that the orientation-dependent doping efficiency is due to the spatial arrangement of the dopant with respect to the intramolecular D moiety in the copolymer. Although the quadrupole-induced energy landscape shift is unfavourable for charge transfer doping, optimizing the local electronic structure via doping can compensate for the morphological defects in our case. This may motivate an entirely new design of charge–quadrupole interaction between the dopants and organic semiconductors with D–A structure to alleviate the morphological defects in OSCs.
