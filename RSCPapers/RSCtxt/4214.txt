This type of negative effect has hindered the commercialization of organic solar cells. This paper reports on a study of the degradation behavior of a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bilayer or BHJ. A combination of morphological and surface element analysis was investigated to identify the effects of oxygen and aging temperature on device degradation

Broader context
Obvious morphological changes in the BHJ or bilayer of photovoltaic devices can be accelerated when the active layer is treated in a high temperature and air condition due to the physical degradation of the PCBM aggregation.

Introduction
Photovoltaic devices based on conjugated polymer and fullerene derivatives, particularly devices used for sustainable electricity and renewable energy sources, have been extensively researched and reported in recent years owing to their great potential advantages and numerous areas of application.1–7Polymer-based photovoltaic devices have many advantages, such as easy solution processibility, low-cost fabrication, and flexible realization for large-area devices. Existing research on improving the device performance has focused on how the efficient device structures of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ), particularly structures which have a high donor–acceptor interfacial contact area, enhance the charge generation and separation ability.8–16 Another widely studied device structure is the bilayer. It appears to have better charge transportation properties than the BHJ because of its efficient transportation along the donor–acceptor pathway and the low possibility of recombination in the active layer.17–20 Other factors that reportedly boost the commercialization of photovoltaic devices include effective nano-pattern structures,21,22 tandem devices with new low-band gap materials,23,24 and new printing techniques.25–27
Nowadays the leading research groups of companies and universities are focused on using physical and chemical theoretical mechanisms to establish the world's most efficient photovoltaic devices; that is, devices which register high values in terms of the open circuit voltage (Voc), the short circuit current (Jsc), and the fill factor (FF). However, besides achieving greater levels of efficiency, polymer-based photovoltaic devices must be preferentially tested and checked in terms of durability, because polymer materials can be easily degraded and destroyed through various physical and chemical degradation pathways. Thus, the short life span of the device is still an obstacle for commercialization.28 Investigating the physical and chemical changes of an active layer aged under various severe conditions (such as direct contact with air or aging under high temperatures) can therefore be a meaningful way of improving long-term stability for rapid commercialization of organic photovoltaic devices.29–31
Several research groups have demonstrated that the performance of a device depends on the way the nanoscale morphology changes as a result of post-thermal treatment. Recent papers have reported improved power conversion efficiencies after thermal annealing of polymer solar cells at elevated temperatures.32,33 However, previously reported data on initial cell performances and the morphologies of active layers were gathered just after the thermal annealing procedure. We therefore believe that the initial morphology and its related cell efficiency cannot represent the overall cell performance because the morphology may change during the continuous heating and cooling steps of an outdoor test. Consequently, the morphological changes of active layers must be studied more deeply under various temperature conditions as a function of time.
In this study, we prepared a device with a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bilayer or a P3HT/PCBM BHJ; we then observed the performance of the device as a function of storage time during aging under room temperature or continuous heating and cooling in air or nitrogen gas. Our investigation was focused on the relation between device stability and morphological changes. The bilayer and BHJ devices show different morphological changes and oxidation behaviors. The degradation mechanisms discerned in this work can be used to optimize the device structure.
Experimental
Fabrication of photovoltaic devices with either a P3HT/PCBM bilayer or a BHJ
The photovoltaic devices with a bilayer or BHJ were fabricated as follows: indium tin oxide (ITO) glass with a resistivity value of 15 Ω cm−2 was cleaned with chloroform, acetone, and isopropanol and then treated with oxygen plasma for 10 min before use. The conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (Baytron P) was spin-coated to a thickness of approximately 40 nm onto the ITO glass. A mixture of 4 wt% P3HT dissolved in a chlorobenzene solvent was used to spin-coat a 110 nm thick electron donor layer. Subsequently, a mixture of 5 wt% PCBM dissolved in a dichloromethane was spin-coated on top of the P3HT layer to produce a 110 nm thick electron acceptor. All the coating procedures were done in a glove box. The total thickness of the active bilayer was approximately 200 nm because of an intermixed zone.17 As another type of device, a BHJ active layer consisting of 4 wt% P3HT and PCBM dissolved in a chlorobenzene solvent at a blend ratio of 1:0.6 was spin-coated. A metal Al electrode was thermally deposited to a thickness of 150 nm under a vacuum pressure of 10−6 Torr and an evaporation velocity of 4 k Å s−1. The deposited Al electrode area defines the active area of the device, which was revealed by a video-microscope system (SOMETECH, SV-35) to be in the range of 3 mm2 to 5 mm2. Finally, the photovoltaic devices with either a bilayer or a BHJ were post-annealed at 150 °C for 30 min to enhance the cell efficiency. The post-annealing was conducted in a glove box, wherein a digital controllable hotplate was used under an inert gas condition.
Evaluation of the cell performance and analysis of the active morphology in photovoltaic devices
The photo-current density curves were measured at AM 1.5 illumination with a Keithley 2400 source measure unit. A 1000 W xenon lamp (Oriel, 91193) was used as a light source for the photovoltaic devices and, before use, its intensity was calibrated by means of a silicon reference cell (Fraunhofer ISE, certificate no. C-ISE269) at room temperature. A long-term stability test of the devices was conducted under the following four conditions: room temperature (25 °C) in air; room temperature in N2; alternating temperature change from 80 °C (storage time: 12 h) to 25 °C (storage time: 12 h) in air; and alternating temperature change from 80 °C (storage time: 12 h) to 25 °C (storage time: 12 h) in N2. For convenience, the alternating temperature change conditions are referred to as high temperature conditions. The surface morphology and roughness of the bilayer and BHJ films were observed with a D3100 Veeco atomic force microscope (AFM) in a noncontact tapping mode. In addition, all the inner structures of the devices with a bilayer or BHJ were clearly confirmed by means of a focused ion beam (FIB). An X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (ESCA 2000) and UV-VIS spectrophotometer (CARY 100 Conc) were used to identify the chemical changes and optical properties of the active layers.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the device stability test on a P3HT/PCBM bilayer or BHJ as a function of storage time (0 h, 100 h, and 200 h) at room temperature or alternating temperature change from 80 °C (storage time: 12 h) to 25 °C (storage time: 12 h) under different conditions of air and nitrogen. The controlled stability test under different conditions enables us to differentiate the physical degradation of the devices from the oxygen-induced chemical degradation. The alternate aging test under the conditions of 80 °C and room temperature cooling is an especially meaningful test because the photovoltaic device was operated at a temperature of about 80 °C during the day and at room temperature during the night.

The initial device performance of two different BHJ cells is 3.34% and 3.63%, respectively (Table 1). After 200 h, the device efficiency fell from 3.34% to 2.29% when the device was aged at room temperature and from 3.63% to 2.44% when the device was aged at high temperature. In contrast, the initial cell efficiency of the bilayer was 2.18% and 2.74%, respectively. However, after 200 h, the device efficiency fell from 2.18% to 1.57% when the device was aged at room temperature and from 2.74% to 1.49% when the device was aged at high temperature.

We can exclude the effects of oxygen and water because all the cells were aged in an N2 atmosphere.34,35 Hence, the decreased cell efficiency of the devices can be explained in terms of physical changes. As a result, the most promising possibility appears to be the change of morphology after the aging step. Except for the bilayer cell aged at high temperature, all the cells manifest very similar decay behavior.
For a detailed investigation of the surface morphology changes of the devices aged at high temperature, we used a combination of the Focused Ion Beam (FIB) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis to identify the entire inner structure and surface morphology of the device. Fig. 3 shows the entire device sequential inner structure of (a) the P3HT/PCBM bilayer and (b) the BHJ after 200 h of aging at high temperature in N2. The performance of the photovoltaic devices can generally be affected by the thickness of the active layer because the thickness of the active layer maximizes the absorption of solar radiation with quantifiable improvements in the value of the photo-current density (Jsc).36,37 Thus, the thickness of the bilayer should match the thickness of the BHJ active films in photovoltaic devices. The cross-sectional images in Fig. 3(a) and (c) show that the total thickness of the active layer is approximately 220 nm in both the bilayer and the BHJ. From the top surface point of the view in the SEM image, the surface of the bilayer (Fig. 3(b)) has many more aggregated micron-sized rod particles than the surface of the BHJ (Fig. 3(d)). As shown in Fig. S1†, the aggregated micron-sized rod-shaped particles seem to form an agglomerated PCBM cluster because the AFM and SEM images of the surface of the pure P3HT layer fail to show any significant changes in the surface morphology after aging at room temperature or high temperature. The unexpected morphological changes consequently induce a much larger efficiency decrease in the bilayer device (about 56%) than in the BHJ device (33%). In addition, the bilayer device aged at room temperature for 160 h has greater long-term stability with a smaller efficiency reduction of 28% than the BHJ device of 31%. These results confirm that the cell efficiencies of all devices gradually decrease, even in an N2 atmosphere; this behavior is presumably due to the fact that, regardless of the working temperature, changes in the surface morphology cause physical degradation. Nevertheless, when the device is operated under high temperature, the BHJ appears to be a more stable active layer than the bilayer.

Fig. 4 shows the efficiency decay behavior of devices with a P3HT/PCBM bilayer or a BHJ layer aging after 200 h at room temperature or high temperature in air. The initial device performance of the BHJ was 2.52% and 2.66%, respectively, to identify the device decay behavior in two different conditions. The device efficiency decreased to 28% and 17% of its initial value when these cells were aged after 200 h at room temperature or high temperature, respectively (Fig. S2†). However, as shown in Fig. 4, the cell efficiency in the bilayer devices decreased to 38% and 5% of its initial value after aging at room temperature or high temperature in air. All device efficiency values decreased sharply when the devices were aged in air. The bilayer cell aged at high temperature showed worse long-term stability than the BHJ device. A comparison of I–V curves before and after the aging process shows that the decay of the open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) is not severe whereas the short circuit current (Jsc) is significantly decreased (from 9.16 mA cm−2 to 1.61 mA cm−2 for the case of the bilayer device at high temperature. The surface morphology changes of both devices were characterized by means of a SEM image (Fig. 5) and an AFM image (Fig. S3†).

 Fig. 5  
          SEM images of the top view of the active layer with an annealed (a) P3HT/PCBM bilayer and (b) P3HT/PCBM BHJ after storage time of 200 h at alternating temperature change from 80 °C (storage time: 12 h) to 25 °C (storage time: 12 h) in air. 
Interestingly, for both cases the morphological changes (particularly the large aggregation of PCBM in the bilayer and the BHJ) were more severe than those of P3HT/PCBM bilayer or BHJ devices aged in an N2 atmosphere. The aggregated PCBM clusters are attributed mainly to the breakdown of the interface between the active layer and the cathode, which greatly reduces the value of Jsc. Fig. S2(a) and (b)† confirm that PCBM tends to aggregate when exposed to high temperature. However, the morphological change of the BHJ film is not as severe as that of the bilayer film. From these results, we can conclude that the P3HT molecules can retard the phase segregation of PCBM molecules. More importantly, the aggregation behavior is accelerated by the oxygen and water in air.
To confirm whether the micro-sized aggregate is PCBM, we used energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. Fig. 6 shows the atom population of the surface of the aged P3HT/PCBM bilayer and BHJ. Fig. 6(a) shows the top surface (PCBM) of the bilayer. As expected, there is a high oxygen content but a low sulfur content. However, the top surface of the BHJ has a low oxygen content and a high sulfur content due to the P3HT regions, which are shown in the inset of Fig. 6(b). The EDS analysis confirms that micro-sized rod-shaped aggregate is PCBM. Another interesting degradation behavior is the fact that the bilayer device is more sustainable than the BHJ device when they are aged in air at room temperature. One possible reason for this behavior is that the PCBM layer can act as a shielding layer, which prevents the intrusion of oxygen and humidity into the electronically active P3HT polymers.

The top regions of the P3HT/PCBM bilayer reveal a lower sulfur content and a higher oxygen content than the BHJ top regions due to the micro-sized aggregated PCBM cluster. 

Fig. 7 shows the UV-VIS absorption spectra of annealed P3HT/PCBM BHJ and bilayer in air with different aging conditions of as cast and alternating temperature change from 80 °C (storage time: 12 h) to 25 °C (storage time: 12 h) after 200 h. The P3HT/PCBM bilayer and BHJ absorption peaks between the wavelengths of 500 nm and 600 nm show enhanced intensity related to the segregation of P3HT domains with an intraplane and interplane stacking ordered structure for aging at high temperature.38–40

In the case of the bilayer, the absorption increase for P3HT is more obvious than that of the BHJ film. Changes in the absorption spectra of PCBM also reveal similar behavior. The absorption intensity near the 330 nm wavelength is also greatly increased in the bilayer film. From these results, we can predict an acceleration in the morphological changes of P3HT and PCBM in the bilayer when the active layer is annealed in air at high temperature.
Conclusions
Photovoltaic devices based on a polymer donor–acceptor with a P3HT/PCBM bilayer or BHJ gradually deteriorate due to the morphological changes caused in the active layer degradation by the operating temperature and air. The SEM and AFM observations confirm that the bilayer undergoes more severe morphological changes at high temperature that these factors disturb the efficient electricity generation in the device. The micro-sized aggregated PCBM cluster induces a negative effect such as an electron and hole trap sites, resulting in a decreased photo-current density (Jsc) and performance. Additionally, the morphological changes of P3HT and PCBM in the bilayer or BHJ are evidently accelerated when the active layer is annealed at high temperature in air. This analysis of the surface morphological changes in the active layer is expected to help for enhancing the durability and long-term stability of photovoltaic devices.

 	Fig. 2  Normalized efficiency levels of devices with an annealed P3HT/PCBM bilayer or BHJ as a function of storage time at room temperature or alternating temperature change from 80 °C (storage time: 12 h) to 25 °C (storage time: 12 h) in nitrogen (-■- bilayer at room temperature; -●- bilayer at 80 °C and room temperature cooling; -●- BHJ at room temperature; -▼- BHJ at 80 °C and room temperature cooling).	 

0 h	2.18	2.74	3.34	3.63
100 h	1.80	1.85	2.77	2.85
200 h	1.57	1.49	2.29	2.44

 	Fig. 3  
          FIB tilted images of the entire device sequential inner structure and SEM images of the annealed (a) and (b) P3HT/PCBM bilayer or (c) and (d) BHJ with alternating temperature change from 80 °C (storage time: 12 h) to 25 °C (storage time: 12 h) after 200 h in nitrogen.	 

 	Fig. 4  Normalized efficiencies of the devices with an annealed P3HT/PCBM bilayer and BHJ as a function of storage time at room temperature or alternating temperature change from 80 °C (storage time: 12 h) to 25 °C (storage time: 12 h) in air (-■- bilayer at room temperature; -●- bilayer at 80 °C heating and room temperature cooling; -▲- BHJ at room temperature; -▼- BHJ at 80 °C heating with room temperature cooling).	 

 	Fig. 5  
          SEM images of the top view of the active layer with an annealed (a) P3HT/PCBM bilayer and (b) P3HT/PCBM BHJ after storage time of 200 h at alternating temperature change from 80 °C (storage time: 12 h) to 25 °C (storage time: 12 h) in air.	 

 	Fig. 6  
EDS spectra of the top regions of (a) a P3HT/PCBM bilayer and (b) a BHJ after 200 h of storage at alternating temperature change from 80 °C (storage time: 12 h) to 25 °C (storage time: 12 h) in air. The top regions of the P3HT/PCBM bilayer reveal a lower sulfur content and a higher oxygen content than the BHJ top regions due to the micro-sized aggregated PCBM cluster.	 

 	Fig. 7  
UV-VIS absorption spectra of annealed P3HT/PCBM in air for (a) an as cast BHJ, (b) a BHJ at alternating temperature change from 80 °C (storage time: 12 h) to 25 °C (storage time: 12 h) after 200 h, (c) an as cast bilayer, (d) a bilayer at alternating temperature change from 80 °C (storage time: 12 h) to 25 °C (storage time: 12 h) after 200 h.
