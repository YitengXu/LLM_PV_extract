1 Introduction
Optoelectronic conversion in luminescent lamps, flexible screens and enhanced solar cells has recently became an important field of research and innovation, and the respective new advanced functionalized materials are required for this. Efficient photonic conversion is needed for public/household white light generation (WLG) in flexible screens and enhancement of efficiency of solar cells (SCs) by solar light down-shifting (LDS).
The search for new efficient materials for energy conversion and their application in environment-friendly light sources (mercury-free) has become an important national-level program in many countries, including countries of European Union1 and USA.2,3
Solid state lighting (SSL)4–10 is considered as a main technology for environment-friendly and efficient light production, Fig. 1 and 2, i.e. homes, street and office lighting, which will potentially allow for significant cost savings in energy consumption, Fig. 3. According to various R&D and manufacturing roadmaps efficient SSL technologies could be implemented in the market by the year 2020 with the manufacturing cost of a LED package reduced by 10 times as compared to 2010.1,3

Modern commercial LEDs generate light by mixing blue light of a GaN or InGaN diode with the broad yellow emission of the Ce3+:YAG phosphor. Newly developed phosphors rely on RGB mixing of emission of certain rare-earth elements. Rare earth elements, such as Tb3+, Eu3+ and Ce3+, are used as phosphors in lighting applications, e.g. in modern fluorescent lamps (FLs), screen monitors and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Materials containing these rare earth ions, e.g. polymers, crystalline/amorphous solids, are promising candidates for applications in solar spectrum down- and up-conversion. However, due to the world's growing demand for rare earth elements, which is projected to reach 200000 tons per year by 2014,11 with a growing shortage of about 40000 tons per year by 2014, it is crucial to identify new cheap materials capable of delivering cost-effective light energy conversion in WLG and LDS, but especially in commercial white light generation.
It was proposed that the potential new material is silver in the form of luminescent Ag nanoclusters in doped glasses.13–16
Silver, or more precisely silver compounds such as silver nitrides and halides, is a relatively cheap and abundant material. It has a high and growing capacity for annual production, which at present completely covers the annual demand.17,18 Presently, about 55% of silver demand originates from industrial applications.13
Silver is widely used in medicine due to its antiseptic action, in photography, and in microelectronics due to good electric conductivity. Silver doped semiconductors, such as ZnS:Ag or ZnCdS:Ag, are used as commercial blue and red phosphors, respectively.5
Recently it has been shown that Ag nanoclusters, which consist of a few Ag atoms, can be efficiently synthesized in different forms such as colloids, sol–gels and bulk glasses. These Ag nanoclusters exhibit efficient tuneable luminescence, with QE up to 70%, with a tailored visible emission spectrum.
In this review we focus on the rapid development of a new class of nanostructured materials based on luminescent Ag nanoclusters. We consider how different preparation techniques and host materials influence important optical properties of the nanoclusters, such as luminescence and its quantum efficiency. Solid hosts such as glasses, crystals and zeolites can be more beneficial for lighting applications due to their mechanical and optical properties. Thus special attention is paid to a group of solid glassy materials doped with luminescent Ag nanoclusters due to their superior structural and optical properties. We show how these materials can be used to efficiently generate white light under UV excitation.
We also review very recent progress within a novel type of phosphor containing both luminescent Ag nanoclusters and rare-earth elements. The efficient energy transfer excitation of Ag nanoclusters results in the emission of both nanoclusters and rare-earth ions. These luminescent bands can be mixed to produce tuneable visible emission and white light, while the control can be achieved through alternation of doping levels, host chemical composition or excitation wavelength.
We conclude by assessing the prospects for this novel class of nanomaterials, including possible applications as well as areas of research, which require deeper investigation.
2 Spectral down-shifting and its applications for white light generation in luminescent lamps, screen monitors and enhancement of efficiency of solar cells
Both WLG and LDS suitable materials have the same concept: a layer of host material is activated/doped with luminescent species/luminophores, which absorb UV-blue light. The absorbing species then re-emit light at longer wavelength/smaller energy, due to the Stokes shift. For the WLG application, the produced light leaves a device, whereas in the case of LDS the down-shifted emission is absorbed by an active material of a solar cell, which then converts the photons into electric current.
Since, within the perspective adopted in this review, there is no essential difference between WLG and LDS, a common set of requirements for host materials and luminescent dopants is introduced below. Differences in requirements are emphasized where applicable.
2.1 Hg-free white light generation: different approaches
A frequency down-conversion, or down-shifting, process has been used for decades for white light generation in, e.g. Hg gas-discharge luminescent lamps, where UV-light emitted by electrically excited Hg-ions is re-absorbed by a phosphor followed by the re-emission of spectrally broad visible light.
In semiconductor based LEDs electric current is directly converted to UV, visible or infrared light. WLG is accomplished by:19,20
(1) white light from mixing the colours of multiple LEDs, emitting in blue, green and red;
(2) a triple-doped phosphor (RGB-phosphor) excited with a UV-LED;
(3) a blue-LED excited yellow phosphor, e.g. a GaN-LED excited Ce3+:YAG yellow phosphor.
The above routes are illustrated in Fig. 4.21

Some commonly used phosphors include:
- trivalent antimony and divalent manganese doped calcium halophosphate Ca5(PO4)3(Cl, F):Sb3+, Mn2+.
- rare earth doped phosphors: Ce3+, Tb3+ and Eu3+ for blue, green and red emission, Fig. 5.22

An alternative approach to WLG is the generation of a broad continuum by a single phosphor, similar to black body radiation, covering the entire visible range. As will be discussed further, Ag nanoclusters doped into glass hosts are capable of producing such luminescence under UV excitation.
White light is characterized by several characteristics, such as correlated colour temperature (CCT), chromaticity, colour rendering index (CRI) and luminous efficacy. These characteristics have to be taken into account when considering the suitability of a particular light emitting material for white light generation. The above characteristics are used to compare a given material to a reference white light source: black body at a given temperature, a standard YAG:Ce3+ white LED or any other light sources with known properties. For example, determination of chromaticity coordinates of luminescence provides a measure to quantitatively describe the colour of a light source as seen by a human eye. Therefore further in this section we introduce the above concepts.
CRI is a dimensionless index which shows how well the colour of an object illuminated with a light source matches the colour of the same object illuminated with a reference source. The concept of CRI is based on the fact that the perceived object colour depends on the spectral content of the light source it is illuminated with.
The luminous efficacy is defined as a ratio of luminous flux, in lm, to excitation power, in W. Light sources with broad emission may have better CRI but lower luminous efficacy as compared to sources with narrow emission.
The most common way to visualize colour of a light source of a particular spectrum as perceived by a human eye is by the CIE chromaticity diagram, Fig. 6. Based on a tri-stimuli model of colour representation it is possible to represent any spectral distribution of a light source with three values. Since the sum of the three is made to yield unity, only two, x and y, are used in the chromaticity chart; those are called chromaticity coordinates.23–25

Curved black line designates Planck-locus: chromaticity values corresponding to black body radiation at different temperatures. Reprinted from ref. 26 with permission of Prentice Hall.

Correlated colour temperature (CCT), in K, is used to relate a non-Planck emitter, which emits light by ways other than thermal radiation, to a temperature of a black body source, at which both sources have similar chromaticity. Thus lower CCT implies warmer (red-to-yellow) emission, while higher CCT results in colder (more blue) emission. In particular, white light sources with CCT below 3000 K generate warm white; CCT from 3000 to 5000 K corresponds to cool white; CCT above 5000 K to daylight, Fig. 6. General-purpose illumination lamps are specifically designed to fall on or in the proximity of the Planck-locus.
2.2 Host materials
Let us first consider the choice of host materials for WLG and LDS. Since luminescent dopants are typically required to absorb in the near-UV and blue part of the spectrum, and emit in blue, green, red or near-IR (Stokes shift), the host material is required to be transparent throughout a broad range of wavelengths, meaning small self-absorption and scattering. Excitation under UV typically causes degradation of the host, resulting in performance deterioration; therefore materials with prolonged photostability, mechanical and chemical durability, such as glasses or crystals, should be preferred. The potential hosts are required to possess mechanical and chemical stability in a broad range of environmental conditions, which is important, e.g. for outdoor lighting and solar collection. Last but not least is the availability of reliable and cheap production methods, compatible with the existing technologies.
Inorganic glass host materials satisfy the above requirements. Different types of glasses exist, such as oxide-, fluoride-, sodium-, phosphate-glasses and mixed ones, e.g. oxyfluoride glasses. The glasses can be made transparent in near UV, below 350 nm, by the addition of fluoride components, such as CaF2 and ZnF2. Glasses typically show little to no photodegradation under prolonged exposure to moderate intensity UV radiation and withstand high, several hundred degrees, and low, down to few Kelvin, operating temperatures.
2.3 Luminescent activators
Host materials provide a dispersion medium for luminescent activators; the latter are responsible for the absorption of exciting light and generation of visible emission. The luminescence intensity is typically described in terms of quantum yield (QY) of luminescence.
Note that whereas for LDS a narrow emission band, coinciding with the peak of the solar cell QE, is required, WLG may result from the emission of a broad spectrum or from mixing of several narrow bands, located in different parts of the visible spectrum. Also spectral separation between the absorption and emission bands, in order to minimize losses due to self-absorption, is necessary. Finally, low material cost and prolonged photostability are required for higher efficiency–cost ratio.
Materials suitable for application in WLG and LDS include quantum dots (QDs), organic dyes, rare-earth ions/complexes and novel Ag nanoclusters. In this review we focus on Ag nanoclusters.
2.4 Luminescent Ag nanoclusters: what they are
This novel type of optically active nanostructured materials has emerged recently, but has already attracted significant attention.27–30 Generally, metals and their respective nanoparticles, with diameters above a few nm, are not considered as luminescent species. However, as the number of atoms decreases, new molecule-like properties appear, including discrete energy levels and luminescence.
Whereas single Ag+ ions exhibit UV luminescence, Ag nanoclusters consisting of a few Ag atoms, with the corresponding diameter about 1 nm, Fig. 7, possess strong visible photoluminescence, even under weak, μW and nW, excitation. Silver nanoclusters are routinely dispersed within colloids, sol–gels, zeolites and glasses. They typically demonstrate strong UV-blue absorption and violet to near-IR emission. Certain luminescent Ag nanoclusters have been identified, such as Ag2, Ag3 and Ag4. However, properties of the Ag nanocluster luminescence depend strongly not only on the Ag nanocluster size but also on the choice of the host material.

Tiny, about 1 nm and less, Ag aggregates can be seen. Reprinted from ref. 13 with permission of Optical Society of America. Copyright 2013. 
Luminescence detected from Ag nanoclusters varies from relatively narrow bands, occurring in the visible part of the spectrum, to extremely broad, from near 380 nm to about 1000 nm, continuous bands. Ag nanoclusters dispersed in the liquid phase and some crystalline hosts, i.e. nanocrystalline ZnO, typically produce narrow emission bands, whereas amorphous hosts, such as glass or internal voids of zeolite-structures, usually have substantially broadened luminescence bands. As the number of silver atoms in a nanocluster increases the emission peak tends to shift towards longer wavelengths, redshift. As will be shown in the following sections, in certain cases the width of the emission band is suggested to result from distortions in the distances between Ag atoms within a nanocluster or other effects due to variations in the local environment of nanoclusters, i.e. inhomogeneous broadening.
3 Ag nanocluster doped glasses for Hg-free white light generation
Encapsulation within transparent glass hosts provides the best structural and chemical stabilization of Ag nanoclusters. Also Ag nanoclusters encapsulated in glass show broadened absorption bands, as well as broad continuous emission, from 380 nm up to 1000 nm. Encapsulation of Ag nanoclusters in the glass host allows for tunability of intensity and spectral characteristics of emission, e.g. by heat-treatment.15
Ag nanocluster doped glasses are commonly prepared via ion-exchange,31–39 glass melt-quenching13,14,40–45 and glass staining46 techniques. Glass types include soda-lime,31,33,36,38,40,46 silica,32,34,35,39,47 alumina-phosphate,37,41 zinc-phosphate,42–44 tellurite48 and oxyfluoride13,14 glasses. Ion-exchange and ion-implantation typically require an additional activation step, such as heat-treatment,32,38,40,46 laser-,32,35,38,41,42,44,45,47 ion-,31 γ-,34 or X-ray38-irradiation, for diffused or exchanged Ag-ions to form luminescent nanoclusters. Silver ion-implantation and ion-diffusion result only in surface doping of glass samples due to limited diffusion: up to a few μm.33,34,49
Ag nanoclusters dispersed in the glass host exhibit single broad-band emission, covering the VIS and near-IR range of the spectrum, when excited under UV.13,50,51 The emission peak typically lies in the 500–600 nm range, Fig. 8. Structural investigations13,14,16,50 show that small Ag species, such as Ag-dimers50,52 or Ag-tetramers,16,52 are responsible for luminescence. The breadth of the emission is due to the distribution of Ag-tetramers' sizes and their local surroundings. The energy levels diagram, obtained by DFT calculations,53,54 of such Ag nanoclusters involves fast, ns, allowed singlet–singlet transitions as well as inter-system crossing with subsequent slow, up to few hundred μs, triplet–singlet redshifted emission.

Because radiative transitions originate from outer d-orbitals, the luminescence is sensitive to local crystal fields. Chemical composition of the glass, e.g. oxide to fluoride ratio in the case of oxyfluoride glass, influences the breadth and shape of the emission as well as its quantum efficiency and lifetime.14,15 An energy transfer occurs between neighbouring Ag nanoclusters55 or from Ag nanoclusters to other luminescent dopants, such as rare-earth ions,13 the latter is addressed in Section IV of the review.
The Ag nanoclusters dispersed within glass hosts are reported to be very stable against photobleaching, having quantum yield up to 20% (ref. 14 and 15) and being stable against ageing: their luminescent and structural properties remain unchanged for years. Recently it was demonstrated that Ag nanoclusters doped into bulk oxyfluoride glass produce white light with chromaticity matching that of a commercial YAG:Ce3+ LED under UV excitation, Fig. 9.15 Therefore these glasses may be used for white light generation in fluorescent lamps and UV-LEDs or as transparent down-shifting layers in solar cells. In addition, thin glass layers become flexible which opens up new possibilities for their application in flexible screens.

4 Ag nanoclusters dispersed in other hosts: luminescence
4.1 Colloidal Ag nanoclusters
Synthesis of Ag nanoclusters in different solutions relies on the reduction of Ag ions in the presence of stabilizers, Fig. 10. Luminescent properties of the colloidal Ag nanoclusters depend strongly on stabilizing agents/molecules and immersion solution. Preparation of colloidal Ag nanoclusters in water or organic solvents is described in detail in recent reviews,28,29 further we only consider luminescent properties of such compounds.

An organic protection group is mixed with silver ions (large grey atoms, not drawn to scale) in aqueous solution, followed by photoactivation or chemical reduction of silver ions to generate silver nanodots (cluster of large orange atoms). Many spectrally pure silver nanodots are prepared with emission ranging from the near UV to the near-IR. The picture above the schematic nanodot shows the real colours of several DNA-encapsulated silver nanodot solutions and that above the spectra shows the typical DNA sequence-dependent Ag nanodot emission when each solution is excited near its individual excitation maximum. DNA sequence and silver nanodot size vary for each emitter, leading to the very different emission spectra. Reprinted from ref. 28 with permission of Royal Society of Chemistry. Copyright 2013. 
Relatively narrow, FWHM about 100 nm,56–65 or broad66–72 bands of luminescence from UV to near-IR, with quantum efficiency from few% up to 70% at room temperature, are observed, Fig. 11.

Due to the high quantum efficiency of narrow emission in green and red and large absorption cross-section in blue the encapsulated Ag nanoclusters may be applied as down-shifting layers in solar cells. In principle sol–gels containing encapsulated Ag nanoclusters may be used as green and red phosphors excited with a blue LED in two or three colour mixing LEDs.
Another potential application of the colloidal luminescent Ag nanoclusters, which can be produced in the form of very thin flexible films, is in flexible monitors, where they can be an alternative to organic dyes. Possibly the first investigation of electroluminescent and chemiluminescent properties of the Ag nanoclusters is reported in ref. 73 and 74.
4.2 Ag nanocluster doped zeolites
Zeolites are crystalline inorganic materials, which have cation exchange capacity.75–77 Zeolites structure naturally and they have 1–2 nm size pores.75 This unique property allows them to be used as catalysts, scaffolds and host materials in many applications.78
It was previously demonstrated that the spatial confinement, provided by extremely small pore sizes and the Ag-reduction process, can be used to nucleate Ag nanoclusters consisting of a few Ag atoms76,79–82 within zeolite pores, which exhibit visible luminescence upon UV excitation.83–86
Many different types of luminescent Ag nanoclusters have been identified within zeolite structures, such as Ag3, Ag4, Ag6, Ag8 and Ag11 neutral or charged,76,82,86,87 with excitation band from 250 to 500 nm and emission from 400 to 800 nm, Fig. 12.80 The emission of Ag nanoclusters in zeolites has a large Stokes shift.
 Fig. 12  Single-crystal emission characterization for the Ag3+ clusters inside zeolite A. (a) True-color fluorescence microscopy images of four individual heat-treated Ag6, K–A zeolite crystals upon UV excitation. It is clear that the emission is not restricted to the outer rim of the crystal. The emission can thus be assigned to intraporous silver clusters. The individual crystals have sizes ranging from 2 to 5 μm. (b) Emission spectra of Ag6, Na–A zeolites upon 400 nm illumination. The black curve corresponds to the bulk spectrum (measured in a fluorimeter), while the coloured curves represent spectra from individual crystals measured on a confocal fluorescence microscope.

Zeolites are cheap and can be fabricated in large quantities. Therefore, Ag nanocluster doped zeolites are promising materials for wavelength converters, such as fluorescence lamps and solar cells, and optical storage. However, there are no data about their actual luminescence efficiency at present. Also, a problem is that zeolites are porous materials, which easily absorb/soak water from atmosphere, making them mechanically and chemically unstable materials; i.e. they do not seal Ag nanoclusters permanently.
4.3 Ag nanocluster doped ZnO
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a wide band gap II–VI semiconductor with a band gap of 3.4 eV and a large exciton binding energy of 60 meV. ZnO is used, for example, in transparent electrodes, liquid crystal displays, LEDs and solar cells.88–92 ZnO demonstrates excitonic luminescence around 380 nm and broad defect related visible luminescence, peaking in green.88,89
It was observed that Ag doping results in changes in UV, visible and near-IR emission of the ZnO host, Fig. 13 and 14. In particular, Ag doping enhances defect-related luminescence of ZnO.93–96 These changes are explained in terms of stabilization93,94 and generation of new defects.95,96 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory simulations showed that Ag+ ions may substitute for Zn2+ or become interstitial atoms.93–95,97,98

It is also possible that Ag-doping results in the formation of Ag nanoclusters and larger Ag nanoparticles, as argued in ref. 95, 96 and 98. These Ag nanoclusters either enhance defect-related blue-green luminescence95 or create a new emission band in near-IR.96
Despite obvious advantages of Ag doped ZnO for white light generation and UV-blue light downconversion in solar cells, there are still not enough systematic studies dealing with optical properties of the doped ZnO host. One of the most important issues with ZnO doping is the low doping limit of 1018 cm−3.93 Other issues are defect stability and reproducibility of doping, which are important for practical applications in devices.
5 Ag nanocluster and rare-earth (RE) ion co-doped glasses
White light may not only be generated with Ag or rare-earth singly doped hosts but also with a combination of the two. In these tandem materials silver may play a role of a sensitizer for rare-earth ions or produce its own luminescence on a par with other co-dopants.
Both the single Ag-cations and the Ag nanoclusters may be used for the excitation of luminescence of Dy3+,99,100 Eu3+,101–104 Yb3+,13,51 Er3+,105–107 Sm3+,100,108 rare-earth ions, Fig. 15.13 Colour mixing is possible in samples, which demonstrate visible luminescence of both Ag nanoclusters and rare-earth ions,102–104,106,107 Fig. 16. The energy transfer from Ag nanoclusters to rare-earth ions, which is typically detected in luminescence excitation spectra,51 occurs via the Forster/Dexter mechanism.

UV-driven white luminescence was demonstrated in Ag–Eu co-doped glasses, for example in ref. 103 and 104. A broad blue-green emission of Ag nanoclusters combines with red emission of Eu3+ resulting in white light. The chromaticity of the emission depends strongly on the excitation wavelength: excitation at longer UV-wavelength results in reddish emission.
One of the advantages of such materials is a broadened excitation window in UV, due to the presence of Ag nanoclusters, as compared to relatively narrow excitation peaks of single rare-earth ions. Another advantage is the higher absorption cross-section of Ag nanoclusters compared to that of rare-earth ions.
6 Conclusions and perspectives
The growing worldwide demand for efficient materials for photonic conversion has resulted in the search for materials, whose properties have never been considered for these applications, similar to porous silicon in the beginning of the 1990s. A specific area of research on novel phosphors suitable for white light generation under ultraviolet or blue light excitation recently has received attention of many research groups. Among many investigated materials Ag nanoclusters, consisting of a few-atoms, have attracted special and ever growing interest, due to their easy and cheap mass-fabrication routes, tuneable photonic properties and wide area of possible applications, including lighting, bio-nanotechnology and even information storage by optical means.
In this review we discuss different possibilities of applications of the luminescent Ag nanoclusters for ultraviolet-driven Hg-free white light generation, with a special focus on Ag nanoclusters dispersed within transparent glass hosts. These Ag nanoclusters possess properties required for efficient white light generation: tuneable wavelength and spectral breadth of emission, potentially high quantum yield of luminescence and easy fabrication procedures. The glass hosts doped with luminescent Ag nanoclusters are more attractive for white light generation and solar spectrum down-shifting applications due to the long-term stability of their structural and optical properties as well as bulk nature of the materials and possibility of fabrication of arbitrary shaped volumes, including fibres and μm thick flexible layers.
Despite the substantial and ever-growing number of research papers in the recently emerging field of luminescent Ag nanoclusters, still little is known about the luminescence mechanism and exact atomic structure of these species. More systematic studies of luminescence quantum efficiency are needed. From the applications point-of-view substantial efforts are required to improve the quantum yield of luminescence, especially in the case of Ag nanoclusters dispersed within solid hosts. Due to the restrictions arising from the encapsulation of Ag nanoclusters within solid hosts almost nothing is known about the electroluminescence of these species. Another interesting area of research is the interaction between Ag nanoclusters and other luminescent species. Deeper investigation of this area potentially may result in new materials with enhanced properties. Also it is of interest to investigate the possibility of lasing action in Ag nanocluster functionalized materials.
Overall, luminescent few-atom Ag nanoclusters present a very interesting novel class of nanomaterials, whose physical properties are closer to single-atom behaviour, but allow for broad tunability, which can be achieved by means of suitable synthesis and post-treatment procedures. Perfection of synthesis methods will result in a larger diversity of family of Ag nanoclusters and related materials, and therefore broader area of their applications. In perspective the Ag nanoclusters can be considered as an alternative to rare-earth and semiconductor-based phosphors.

 	Fig. 1  Projected usage of LEDs in mobile appliances, displays and general illumination. Reprinted from ref. 1 with permission of CELMA. Copyright 2013.	 

 	Fig. 2  200-year evolution of luminous efficacy for various lighting technologies. The left axis indicates luminous efficacy, in units of lumens (a measure of light that factors in the human visual response to various wavelengths, lm) per watt (W). The right axis indicates the corresponding power-conversion efficiency for a tri-LED-colour white-light source with moderate colour rendering index (CRI = 80) and relatively warm correlated colour temperature (CCT = 3900 K). For such a source, 400 lm W−1 would correspond to 100% power-conversion efficiency. Reprinted from ref. 6 with permission from IEEE. Copyright 2013.	 

 	Fig. 3  Forecasted U.S. Lighting Energy Consumption and Savings, 2010 to 2030. Reprinted from ref. 12 with permission of Navigant. Consulting, Inc. Copyright 2013.	 

 	Fig. 4  Three methods of generating white light from LEDs: (a) RGB + LED, (b) RGB + UV-LED, and (c) blue-LED + yellow phosphor. Reprinted from ref. 21 with permission from IEEE. Copyright 2013.	 

 	Fig. 5  Characteristics of some phosphors other than YAG:Ce for pc-WLEDs excited by blue-LED chips. Reprinted from ref. 22 with permission of Elsevier. Copyright 2013.	 

 	Fig. 6  CIE chromaticity diagram, showing a monochromatic colour locus (horse-shoe shape), which contains all visible colours. Curved black line designates Planck-locus: chromaticity values corresponding to black body radiation at different temperatures. Reprinted from ref. 26 with permission of Prentice Hall. Copyright 2013.	 

 	Fig. 7  Energy filtered transmission electron microscope image of a piece of the basic glass doped with 1 wt% AgNO3 and 3.5 mol% YbF3: the red and the green colour represents Ag and Yb, respectively. Tiny, about 1 nm and less, Ag aggregates can be seen. Reprinted from ref. 13 with permission of Optical Society of America. Copyright 2013.	 

 	Fig. 8  Normalized emission and excitation spectra of the basic glass doped with 5 wt% AgNO3. Emission and excitation wavelengths are indicated, respectively. Reprinted from ref. 13 with permission of Optical Society of America. Copyright 2013.	 

 	Fig. 9  Photographs of luminescence of the sample in Fig. 1 when excited at (a) 300, (b) 310, (c) 325, and (d) 350 nm. (e) CIE chromaticity diagram, based on a CIE 193121 colour matching function, indicates white luminescence colours pictured in (a–d) when excited at 290 (square), 300 (circle) and 310 nm (triangle); the group of overlapping unfilled diamond shapes corresponds to 325–390 nm excitation wavelengths. The red star depicts the chromaticity of a commercial InGaN:Ce3+–YAG light emitting diode (LED). The black dot shows the black body emission at 6667 K, which represents the white colour of a standard LCD monitor. Reprinted from ref. 14 with permission of Elsevier. Copyright 2013.	 

 	Fig. 10  A schematic illustration of silver nanodot creation. An organic protection group is mixed with silver ions (large grey atoms, not drawn to scale) in aqueous solution, followed by photoactivation or chemical reduction of silver ions to generate silver nanodots (cluster of large orange atoms). Many spectrally pure silver nanodots are prepared with emission ranging from the near UV to the near-IR. The picture above the schematic nanodot shows the real colours of several DNA-encapsulated silver nanodot solutions and that above the spectra shows the typical DNA sequence-dependent Ag nanodot emission when each solution is excited near its individual excitation maximum. DNA sequence and silver nanodot size vary for each emitter, leading to the very different emission spectra. Reprinted from ref. 28 with permission of Royal Society of Chemistry. Copyright 2013.	 

 	Fig. 11  Steady-state excitation and emission spectra for five distinct ss-DNA encapsulated Ag nanoclusters. (A) Blue emitters created, (B) green emitters created, (C) yellow emitters created, (D) red emitters created, and (E) near-IR emitters. (F) Pictures of emissive solutions in (A–D). Reprinted from ref. 62 with permission of American Chemical Society. Copyright 2013.	 

 	Fig. 12  Single-crystal emission characterization for the Ag3+ clusters inside zeolite A. (a) True-color fluorescence microscopy images of four individual heat-treated Ag6, K–A zeolite crystals upon UV excitation. It is clear that the emission is not restricted to the outer rim of the crystal. The emission can thus be assigned to intraporous silver clusters. The individual crystals have sizes ranging from 2 to 5 μm. (b) Emission spectra of Ag6, Na–A zeolites upon 400 nm illumination. The black curve corresponds to the bulk spectrum (measured in a fluorimeter), while the coloured curves represent spectra from individual crystals measured on a confocal fluorescence microscope.
