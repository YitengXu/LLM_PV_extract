    , Accepted 29th July 2021First published on 29th July 2021AbstractDue to their outstanding electrochemical properties, electrical conductivity, flexibility, and low-cost, carbon materials open up new opportunities for the design of compact devices with a wide variety of potential applications. Biomass renewable resources for carbon material preparation have attracted huge attention in the last few years due to their widespread availability, low-cost processability and high-performance of the resulting porous carbons for sustainable technological applications. For example, the porosity and morphology of carbon materials, which can be tuned by different activation methods, govern the ion diffusion rate during supercapacitor charge/discharge processes. On the other hand, carbon electrodes have been applied as electrodes for dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells, thanks to their low fabrication cost, compact structure, and optimized interfaces, which play a key role in the charge collection and stability of the devices. Moreover, due to the possibility of using carbon electrodes for storage and conversion devices, efficient methods to harvest and store energy in one single device are crucial for technological advancement and the energy transition process. This contribution aims to review the advances made in the use of carbon materials obtained from biomass sources as electrodes for storage and energy conversion devices, and the future application of shared and/or distinct carbon electrodes for the development of integrated power packs including supercapacitors and dye-sensitized or perovskite solar cells. The storage properties of supercapacitors are discussed in terms of the textural characteristics of biomass-derived activated carbons while the photovoltaic parameters of solar cells based on bio-sourced carbons are compared with those of devices using conventional metal-based electrodes. Finally, special emphasis is placed on the energy conversion–storage efficiencies of solar cell-supercapacitor integrated devices.Nilanka M. KeppetipolaNilanka M.

1. Introduction
Driven by the ever-growing energy demand, the development of high-performance, low-cost, and clean energy technologies is an urgent need in order to reduce the use of fossil fuels and environmental pollution. Among all energy-related technologies, energy storage and energy conversion devices such as supercapacitors (SCs), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) or perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been extensively investigated.1–3 However, the materials used for the design of efficient and low-cost devices play a crucial role.4–6 Carbon materials have opened up new opportunities and have been successfully applied for a wide variety of purposes. Most of the carbon materials employed in energy conversion devices are derived from non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels. In this regard the use of biomass, which is widely available in nature, allows the implementation of carbon materials in sustainable technological applications such as SCs, DSCs and PSCs, which is still a topic under development. Thus, several benchmark reviews have discussed the use of conventional or biomass-derived carbon materials for supercapacitors and for photovoltaic applications.7–11
For solar cell technologies, intermittency constitutes one major limitation for substituting conventional fossil fuel energy resources. High photovoltaic energy conversion efficiencies are indeed reached when the sun directly illuminates solar panels, albeit for only a few hours per day. In this context, pack devices containing solar cells and storage devices, called photo-batteries12–14 or photo-SCs,15–18 have been developed as a solution for devices with continuous power generation. Due to the fact that carbon can be used as an electrode material for both supercapacitors and hybrid solar cells, the devices can be connected through a carbon bridge electrode as shown in Fig. 1a. Such devices, composed of carbon-based solar cells and carbon-based storage devices in one single pack, can simultaneously harvest and store energy from sunlight to satisfy the requirements of some application fields requiring specific properties such as small size, light weight, and high energy density. A brief literature overview revealed that only eighteen papers related to integrated hybrid solar cells with supercapacitors have been published so far, of which twelve describe DSCs/SCs and six PSC/SC systems (Fig. 1b).

To the best of our knowledge, no effort has been devoted to the application of biomass-based activated carbon (AC) in integrated energy conversion–storage systems that could be interesting for future application as sustainable compact electronics. Up to now the best performing carbon-based DSCs-SC integrated device, showing an overall efficiency of 5.12%, was obtained by using an ethylene-derived multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrode,15 while values over 10% were reported for a carbon-based PSC–SC power pack using carbon composite (MWCNTs/pyrrole/bacterial cellulose) and reduced graphite oxide electrodes.16,18
Since the above-described integrated devices are composed of two distinct sub-components, this review summarizes the state of the art of carbon materials derived from biomass with a specific focus on biomass conversion to activated carbon, and their applications as electrode materials for SCs, DSCs and PSCs. Then in the last part the potential integration in one single power pack of hybrid solar cells with supercapacitors by sharing carbon electrodes is overviewed for low-cost sustainable energy technology.
2. Conversion of biomass into activated carbon
Due to its remarkable properties, activated carbon (AC) is used in a wide range of applications.19,20 As depicted in Fig. 2, the interest in AC obtained from carbonaceous materials has risen every year. In this context, activated carbon is a form of carbon, obtained by a suitable treatment of raw materials to provide well-organized macro-, meso- and micro-pores and a wide range of chemical functional groups, which can increase the surface area for adsorption or chemical reactions in the device.21 Large varieties of carbon sources can be used, including fossil and biomass-based materials.8,22,23 Traditionally, carbon materials were extracted from fossil resources such as coal.22 However, the global awareness of environmental impacts and resource limitation has dramatically decreased the motivation for fossil-based material consumption. Therefore, biomass-derived materials, i.e., materials prepared from plants, living organisms, and plant or animal wastes, have attracted great interest for the synthesis of AC materials due to advantageous characteristics, such as abundance, low-cost and easy conversion into conductive carbon, compared to other available sources.22,24 In addition, the use of residual biomass as a low-cost option for the production of ACs has gained more attention in recent years (Fig. 2).

In a general way, the activation process of carbon can be divided into two types, namely physical and chemical activation based on the types of activating agents. Furthermore, these two activation processes can be carried out as single step activation or through a two step process that comprises carbonization followed by activation.25 During the carbonization process, carbon atoms are rearranged to give a graphitic-like structure that creates the initial porosity of the carbonized material.26 This initial porosity generally exhibits a very low surface area due to pore filling or blocking by deposition and decomposition of tar.27 The final product of the carbonization process is named the carbonized material, char or biochar, which is enriched in aromatic rings (Fig. 3).

Through physical activation, biochar is further activated using steam, carbon dioxide, air or a mixture of gases as the activating agent at temperatures around 350–1000 °C, which leads to an increase of the carbon porosity.28 Generally, the activating agent is adsorbed and dissociates in the active sites of the carbon surfaces, generating gases which, in turn, can adsorb on the active sites, thus inhibiting them. The above reaction is reversible, and the active sites are continuously formed upon the creation of porosity.29
In the chemical activation process, organic precursors are activated in the presence of activating agents such as NaOH, KOH, K3CO3, H3PO4 or ZnCl2.30 This activation process can be carried out directly from raw biomass or carbonized biochar. First, activating agents are mixed with carbon samples to merge with the internal structure.21 Depending on the activating agent, various reactions with complex mechanisms take place at higher temperatures with cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contained in the carbon precursor. During the decomposition, activating agents act as dehydrating and oxidizing agents, thereby opening inaccessible pores, allowing the formation of new pores and/or enlarging existing pores while preventing the formation of tar and ash.31 This process is carried out at relatively moderate temperatures (around 300–800 °C) depending on the precursor material. In the final step of chemical activation, AC is washed several times with water to remove the remaining traces of the activating agent.26Fig. 3 depicts the synthetic routes towards AC using different methods.
As example, AC from rice husk was synthesized by Le Van et al. using NaOH as the activating agent and different activation temperatures in the 650–800 °C range.32 As the temperature increased, the surface area changed from 2482 to 2681 m2 g−1. This surface increase was due to the formation of additional pores by volatile compound release at high temperature.33 However higher activation temperatures (above 900 °C) led to a decrease in the surface area, owing to structural changes including pore widening and blocking.34 Furthermore, using H3PO4 as the activation agent, Sun et al. reported an AC surface area of 1252 m2 g−1 from Pomelo peel and 675 m2 g−1 from Arundo donax Linn.35 The total pore volume and mean size for Pomelo peel and Arundo donax Linn were 1.33 cm3 and 4.26 nm and 0.31 cm3 and 1.85 nm, respectively. This work demonstrates that the precursor material has a huge impact on the surface area and pore size distribution of ACs.
Kumar et al. used Fox nutshell for the production of AC with ZnCl2 as the activating agent.36 A high surface area of 2869 m2 g−1 was reached with a total pore volume of 1.96 cm3 g−1. Three different types of AC were prepared by Gundogdu et al. by changing the content of ZnCl2 and using tea waste as the biomass precursor.37 This study reveals that the characteristics and porous structure may depend on the ratio between the starting material and the activating agent. On the other hand, Özsin et al. prepared AC from agricultural wastes of chickpea with K2CO3 and KOH as activating agents and different impregnation ratios.38 At an impregnation ratio of 50 wt% using KOH, the AC showed the highest surface area of 2082 m2 g−1, compared to 1921 m2 g−1 for 75 wt% using K2CO3. Fig. 4 illustrates the diverse porosities reachable as a function of the activation procedure applied to a single precursor material (i.e., chickpea).

The surface properties of activated carbon depend on the precursor material, activating agent and method of preparation. Therefore, depending on the application, ACs can be modified to improve certain properties by introducing functional groups onto the carbon surface.39 Heteroatom dopants can change the electronic properties of carbon by changing the Fermi level.40 Chen et al. prepared activated carbon for PSC applications by using phosphorus (P) or boron (B) dopants in order to enhance conductivity and hole transporting ability. P doped carbon shows n-type properties with better conductivity, while B doped carbon acts as a p-type material.41 Kim et al. synthesized nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) co-doped porous carbons using naturally doped anchovy fish as the precursor, and the final AC product showed higher catalytic activity for CoIII reduction in DSC applications.42 At the same time B-, N- and P-doped activated carbon have shown synergic effects compared to the bare activated carbon by increasing the wettability, charge transfer rate and high charge storage area in supercapacitor applications.43 Certain biomass materials used as precursors for the synthesis of doped ACs naturally contain a uniform distribution of heteroatoms in the structure. For example, soybean precursors (milk, beans, and dregs), bamboo, pine needles, banana peel, walnuts, yogurt, egg white and shells of sea food are rich in nitrogen, while fish skin, fish scales and human hair are rich is nitrogen and sulfur.44 Thus, the selection of the biomass precursors has a strong impact on the physicochemical properties of the obtained carbonaceous materials.
3. Biomass-derived carbon electrodes for supercapacitors
Supercapacitors (SCs) are a class of electrical energy storage devices where the electrical charge is stored at the electrode/electrolyte interface.45 These devices have a very large electrode surface area, which leads to an increase in the capacitance per unit of area. Compared to other available energy storage devices such as batteries and conventional capacitors, SCs are the best alternative energy storage devices that can fill the gap with regard to fast power delivery or harvesting.46 SCs are successfully used to open the heavy emergency exit of the Airbus A380, and are involved in electric cars, buses and electric trains.47,48 All the materials constituting SCs are key, such as the electrode morphology, type of current collectors, separators and electrolytes.49,50 A typical structure of symmetric SCs is shown in Fig. 5a.51 Published articles over the past two decades indicate the possibility of using biomass-based activated carbon as an electrode for supercapacitors (Fig. 5b).

(b) Literature survey using “activated carbon supercapacitors” and “biomass activated carbon supercapacitors” keywords in the Scopus database. 
The most commonly used materials for SC electrodes are based on carbon.52 In particular AC shows a suitable texture for the preparation of high-performance energy storage devices.53–55
In SCs the charge transfer mechanism strongly depends on the surface area accessible to electrolytic ions. Structural parameters such as the pore size and shape, surface functionality and electrical conductivity play a key role in increasing the specific capacitance.56 Among these factors, the pore size has a significant contribution to determine the specific capacitance. The nature of the pore size distribution, more importantly the presence of both micropores and mesopores, governs the penetration or mobility of ions in the porous structure. Previous reports have shown that mesoporous AC has a higher impact on ion diffusion than the microporous one, because narrow micropores (0–1 nm) are not accessible to liquid electrolytes.57 Some reports have shown good agreement between pore dimensions and electrolyte ion size.58 However other studies have reported that micropores are highly desirable for increasing the specific capacitance.59 Therefore, the ratio between the number of micropores and mesopores should be controlled to obtain the highest capacitance.
The characteristics and storage properties of AC prepared from different biomass precursors are summarized in Table 1. The electrochemical performances of SCs are determined using most frequently the cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge/discharge techniques. Evaluation methods and formulae for the calculation of charge stored (capacitance, energy and power densities) in supercapacitors are detailed in the ESI and Table S1.†

As an example, Teo et al. fabricated SCs using rice husk ACs showing a specific surface area of 2121, 2696 and 1592 m2 g−1 for an activation temperature of 750, 850 and 950 °C, respectively.67 A maximum surface area of 2696 m2 g−1 and capacitance of 147 F g−1 were obtained after activation at 850 °C. The micropore volume was then reduced while increasing the mesopore volume. However, the highest pore volume and specific capacitance were obtained at moderate micro- and meso-volumes.
Besides, the dependence of electrochemical performance on the presence of mesopores was studied by Mi et al. using coconut shell AC with well-controlled micro- and meso-porosity obtained by steam activation.4 The mesoporosity was continuously developed with increasing the steam flow rate, while maintaining almost the same micropore volume. The capacitance of each sample was almost equivalent, which indicates that the micropores act as the main charge storage space. In addition, this study revealed that mesopores are responsible for improved ion diffusion and reduce the internal cell resistance. Rufford et al. used charge–discharge cycles to determine the influence of meso- and micro-pores on the capacitance at different charge–discharge rates.68 This study showed that mesopores have more contribution to the capacitance at fast discharge rates compared to micropores. Elmouwahidi et al. synthesized AC using argan seed shells and the capacitance retention was tested with different current loads.69 Nitrogen-rich AC showed the highest capacitance of 355 F g−1 at 125 mA g−1 while maintaining 93% of its capacitance at a high current load (1 A g−1). Also, a highly mesoporous structure has a contribution to retain its capacitance at high current loads. However, oxygen-rich AC led to a capacitance of 259 F g−1 at 125 mA g−1, while maintaining 52% of its capacitance at a high current load (1 A g−1) because carboxyl groups at the surface reduce the electrolyte diffusion into the pores. These findings underline the significant effect of carbon material surface groups on the capacitance values.
In order to reach high storage performance, the electrolyte plays a key role and must fulfill some requirements which are a wide potential window, high electrochemical stability, high conductivity, environmental friendliness and low-cost.70,71 SCs with aqueous electrolytes exhibit high conductance and capacitance compared to those with organic electrolytes and ionic liquids. On the other hand, the operating potential window is low in aqueous electrolytes (<1.2 V) compared to organic electrolytes and ionic liquids (over 3 V). Thus, ionic liquid SCs have higher energy densities, because a wide operating potential window has more impact on the specific energy of the device.61,64–66 Although most commercially available SCs contain organic electrolytes, ionic liquid-based SCs have recently gained much attention, which could overcome the drawbacks of organic electrolytes such as volatility and inflammability.72,73 Yet, to improve ionic conductivity the ionic liquids are usually mixed up with solvents. As an example, Yang et al. employed a 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate/acetonitrile (BMIMBF4/AN) electrolyte and a capacitance of 99 F g−1 was obtained for SCs made of ACs synthesized from waste shaddock endothelium.61 This device showed outstanding performance with a specific energy of 46.88 W h kg−1 and over 93.7% capacity retention after 10000 cycles, which is rarely achieved by SCs employing biomass-sourced carbon materials. Nevertheless, the presence of solvent can lead to electrolyte leakage, which affects the stability of the SCs. In order to solve this stability issue, solvent-free ionic liquids are also used as electrolytes in SCs. As examples, SCs using a solvent-free ionic liquid, such as 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIMBF4) and 1-methyl-1-propyl-pyrrolizinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (MPPyFSI), were developed by several groups,64–66 leading to devices with good specific energy (over 90 W h kg−1). Karnan et al. used AC prepared from Aloe leaves and a capacitance of 306 F g−1 was achieved for devices using aqueous 1 M H2SO4, 244 F g−1 using gel-type polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/H2SO4 and 126 F g−1 using the non-volatile ionic liquid EMIMBF4.65 It is also worth mentioning that the maximum specific energy of the aqueous electrolyte-based device was about 15 W h kg−1 while over 40 W h kg−1 was obtained with the ionic liquid. Therefore, ionic liquid SCs provide wide potential windows with higher specific energy.
4. Biomass-derived carbon electrodes for hybrid solar cells
Owing to its low manufacturing cost, the PSC technology, derived from DSCs, is the most promising next generation alternative to conventional silicon-based cells.74,75
In brief, the first concept of electricity generation from dyes chemisorbed onto metal oxide electrodes in an electrochemical cell was introduced by Gerischer et al. in 1968.76 In 1991, to adsorb larger dye amounts, O'Regan et al. proposed the use of mesoporous TiO2 films showing a surface area several orders of magnitude higher than dense oxide films.74 This solar cell technology allowed the development of DSCs with a PCE of 14.3% (published) and 13.0% (certified by Newport).77–79 Due to the volatile solvents involved in DSCs, which greatly affect the stability and production of the cells, Bach et al. proposed, in 1998, solid-type hole transport materials (HTMs), e.g. spiro-OMeTAD.80 Extensive work has been done for the solidification of the DSC electrolyte, and a PCE of up to 7.2% was reported, which remained lower than that of liquid-DSCs.81
In order to reach higher PCE with solid-state DSCs, Kojima et al. proposed in 2009 to use a hybrid perovskite, i.e., CH3NH3PbI3 (or MAPbI3) and CH3NH3PbBr3 (or MAPbBr3), as a new light-absorber. However, the devices initially showed poor stability due to the dissolution of the perovskite material in liquid electrolytes.75 As, at the same time, Spiro-OMeTAD had become familiar as a hole transport material for the solidification of DSCs, it was also applied as a solid electrolyte to solve the stability issue of the hybrid perovskite. The PCE of solar cells therefore significantly increased up to 9.7%.82 Since then, remarkable improvements have been achieved and the PCE of perovskite solar cells increased up to 25.5% as recently certified.79 According to theoretical calculations, this material has the potential to achieve efficiencies as high as 31% in single junction and over 40% in a tandem configuration with silicon-solar cells.79,83,84 Extensive work was carried out in this field to improve the efficiency, stability under real conditions and fabrication cost of PSCs. In this regard, as low-cost and long-term stability devices, carbon-based PSCs are recognized as extremely appealing candidates for practical applications. Carbon electrode materials derived from biomass have been proposed as promising candidates for hybrid solar cells. Fig. 6 illustrates the evolution of the research in the field of DSCs and the number of papers published on hybrid solar cells with standard and carbon-based configurations.

In the next sections, we will describe the research work reported so far towards the replacement of expensive counter-electrodes with biomass derived carbon electrodes for stable and low-cost DSCs and PSCs.
4.1 Dye-sensitized solar cells
DSC counter electrodes should fulfill several requirements such as a good catalytic activity, long-term thermal and chemical stabilities, and high conductivity. Various types of carbon materials such as carbon black, graphene or carbon nanotubes were used as a back contact in DSCs and PSCs.85–102 It should be noted that the champion DSC structure involves mesoporous TiO2 sensitized with ADEKA-1/LEG4 dyes, a CoIII/II couple as the redox electrolyte and a graphene nanoplate-based counter-electrode (GNP). This system allowed obtaining a PCE of 14.3%, which remains the highest value reported since 2015.77 It was observed that the implementation of graphene as a counter-electrode produces higher PCE, Jsc and FF than pure Pt electrodes. For comparison, a PCE value of 12.25% was reported in 2019 for devices using Y123 dye, a CoIII/II electrolyte and a standard Pt counter-electrode.78,79 Recently, the certified PCE value of DSCs was updated to 13.0%.103
Activated carbon (AC) is another candidate to replace platinum counter-electrodes in DSCs. Extensive work was thus devoted in this direction and is reflected in the number of publications in the last few years as presented in Fig. 6. Only 28 reports are published on the application of ACs extracted from biomass waste as a counter electrode for DSCs and the highest values of PCE are summarized in Table 2.104–113 Highly conductive porous AC can be obtained from biomass with the use of simple activation methods already discussed in the first section and the resulting materials applied as low-cost counter-electrodes for high performance DSCs.

As an example, Jing et al. proposed the activation of carbon extracted from pomelo peel by means of ZnCl2 combined with post-carbonization.104 It was found that catalytic activity significantly increased by including a small amount of self-doping heteroatoms such as N, P, S, Na, Mg, K, Ca, Fe, etc. leading to a homogeneous co-doping in one-carbon matrix structure. The DSCs with carbon-based electrodes yielded a PCE of 8.29%, which was comparable to that using the Pt electrode (8.24%). Later, the same group proposed a self-activation method, eliminating the use of ZnCl2 as the activation agent.105 The solar cell based on this carbon-electrode reached 7.81% PCE, slightly lower than that in the previous report. In another study, Kumarasinghe et al. proposed an efficient method to produce highly conductive coconut shell charcoal using a water activation agent and applied it, then, as a carbon electrode for DSCs.106 Activated carbon from pine cone flowers was obtained by Nagaraju et al. by using KOH as the activation agent and then applied as a counter-electrode material for DSCs.108 This type of biomass was chosen because it is an abundant source of carbon from cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Additionally, the precursor material is a highly porous pulverized powder facilitating the absorption of ionic species K+ and OH− ions during the activation process. To fabricate homogeneous electrodes, a paste containing AC, carbon black, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as the binder and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) as the solvent was coated on FTO substrates and then dried at 80 °C for 6 hours. The DSCs with this type of biomass-based AC electrode exhibited a PCE of 4.98%, a value higher than that measured for commercial AC counter electrodes (4.45%). To generate an effective porous structure, Chung et al. proposed a facile and effective method to prepare porous carbon by the carbonization of earth-abundant coffee waste using ZnCl2 activation.109 Carbon paste was sprayed on top of FTO substrates and heated at 400 °C for 3 hours under an Ar flow. A good PCE of 8.32% was obtained for DSCs using the AC electrode, a value higher than that of conventional Pt-based electrodes (8.07%). Fish waste is also abundant in nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorous elements, and contains a high content of carbon.42,110 Ma et al. achieved the carbonization of fish waste and the resulting material was used as a counter electrode for DSCs.110 Using a simple carbonization method and KOH as the activation agent, the resulting carbon material showed a large surface area (2933 m2 g−1) with high catalytic activity. As a result, the corresponding device exhibited a PCE of 7.83% with Voc = 0.750 V, Jsc = 15.64 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.668. Optimized carbon-based device performances are comparable to those of conventional Pt electrode devices, with PCE = 8.34%, Jsc = 15.98 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.755 V, and FF = 0.691. From CV analysis, it can be seen that the cathodic and anodic current densities retain 90% of their initial values after 100 scanning cycles, demonstrating good stability against the corrosive I−:I3− redox couple electrolyte.
Kim et al. used anchovy fish as a biomass resource to synthesize nitrogen and sulfur co-doped porous carbon by carbonization at 700–900 °C and activation with KOH (Fig. 7).42 On the other hand, carbon electrodes annealed at 900 °C in combination with the SM-315 sensitizer and a cobalt redox couple led to 12.72% PCE compared to 12.23% for Pt-DSCs. According to electrochemical impedance studies, the Rct of Pt and carbon-based electrodes was estimated to be 14.71 Ω and 7.56 Ω respectively. The lower Rct indicates that the carbon-based electrode has a higher electrocatalytic activity for Co3+ reduction at the counter-electrode/electrolyte interface.

For recycling of fallen leaves, Cha et al. used the KOH activation agent during the carbonization to produce porous carbon.111 With AC prepared at an optimized pyrolysis temperature of 800 °C, the carbon-based DSCs showed the highest current density (14.99 mA cm−2) and PCE (5.52%) among other carbon-based electrodes, values comparable to those of Pt-based electrodes. Zhang et al. used Aloe peel to prepare carbon-MWO3 oxide (MWO4 with M = Fe, Co, and Ni) composite electrodes through a hydrothermal method.112 Among all composites, C–NiWO4 exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction and fast electron transport capability. According to impedance measurements, the charge-transfer resistance was reduced from 11.27 Ω to 2.17 Ω when NiWO4 is integrated with carbon. The DSCs with C–NiWO4 achieved a PCE of 7.08% surpassing that of Pt-electrode DSCs (6.46%). Moreover, these devices illustrated high stability in the redox electrolyte at different CV scans.
It was proved by Wang et al. that eggshell membranes can be recycled from domestic waste to prepare a unique micropore-rich carbon powder by carbonization.113 The carbonized eggshell membranes were obtained by immersing the fresh eggshell into a sucrose solution and then carbonizing at 800 °C. The resulting film of carbon prepared by the doctor blade method and annealed at 350 °C led to 6.71% PCE in DSCs, comparable to that obtained with Pt-based counter electrodes (6.63%). Among photovoltaic parameters, the Voc of the carbon-based devices showed a significant improvement from 736 to 795 mV. This increase was attributed to the positive potential shift of the redox couple relative to the Fermi level of TiO2. However, the Jsc of the Pt electrode was slightly higher (13.78 mA cm−2) due to the better reflectance than that of carbon electrodes (13.40 mA cm−2). The higher FF of 0.65 obtained for Pt electrode DSCs was attributed to its lower resistance compared to carbon electrodes (FF of 0.63). As a result, the increased PCE of the carbon-based DSCs was related to the significant change in Voc.
4.2 Perovskite solar cells
In contrast to DSCs, PSC counter electrodes do not require any electrocatalytic activity. In a device involving a hole transport material, the work function of counter-electrode materials should be higher than the Fermi level of the p-type layer. Moreover, the electric conductivity and morphology of the interface with the perovskite are crucial for high performance and long-term stable PSCs. To date, the most popular counter-electrodes for PSCs have been noble metals like gold (Au) or silver (Ag). Apart from high material cost, interfacial degradation due to the metal electrodes has been widely discussed as a major issue preventing PSC development. It was mentioned that the Au migration through the HTM into the perovskite leads to a serious device stability issue.114 On the other hand, Ag tends to react with the perovskite layer leading to its degradation.115 It has been already demonstrated that carbon makes PSCs more stable without using any special sealant.116 A variety of carbon materials have been adopted to replace noble metals and many kinds of perovskite solar cell structures were proposed.117–136 Carbon can indeed play a double function, i.e., HTM and back-contact electrode.
To date, the most performing standard PSC configuration has shown a certified PCE of 25.5% (24.82% published).79,137 For carbon-based PSCs the highest reported value is 15.7% for a ZrO2/C back-electrode configuration (Table 3).138 These remarkable efficiencies are due to the perovskite layer optoelectronic properties and optimized cell structures together with finely tuned interfaces.138,139

As an ultra-low-cost carbon material, biomass can be considered as one of the most important precursor sources. The number of research papers on the application of biomass as a low-cost carbon source for carbon-based PSCs is still limited compared to those dealing with carbon-DSCs. From a careful literature survey (Table 4), only five papers were found with a detailed analysis of the carbon materials obtained from biomass as an electrode for PSCs. For instance, a carbon material derived from Aloe vera plants (AV-C) was used as a counter electrode for PSCs.140 First the Aloe vera gel was removed from leaves and dried under sunlight for 1 day. The dry material was further treated under an oil lamp for one night, thereby converting it into a black powder, which was finally ground by ball milling.

The black powder was washed with 2 M HCl and treated at 1000 °C to be activated. The fine ball-milled AC powder was mixed with CH3NH3I and chlorobenzene to yield a viscous paste that was applied onto a doctor-bladed meso-TiO2 layer, followed by drying at 130 °C for 30 min. The best device exhibited Voc = 0.953 V, Jsc = 15.22 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.50, leading to overall PCE = 7.25%. In another design, a ZrO2 insulating layer was added onto a mesoporous TiO2 layer by spin-coating and then doctor-bladed on top of AV-C. In this case, the optimized device showed Voc = 0.838 V, Jsc = 18.05 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.35, with a PCE of 5.29%. The low FF was attributed to the insufficient thickness of the TiO2/ZrO2 layer. To control the thickness, the screen-printing method was applied to prepare a triple layer-based scaffold mp-TiO2/ZrO2/AV-C. Then the hybrid perovskite precursor was dripped onto mesoscopic layers. The optimized AV-C-based device yielded a Voc = 0.985 V, Jsc = 21.65 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.59, leading to an improved PCE of 12.48%. Un-encapsulated devices involving ZrO2 showed good stability and retained 85% of their initial efficiency after 1000 hours at 35% relative humidity.
Furthermore, coconut shell charcoal was proposed as an abundant, cheap and environmentally friendly precursor material for AC.141 In order to enhance the adhesion of bio-carbon on FTO substrates, the carbon powder was mixed with paraffin oil. The paraffin oil gave a different texture to AC and enhanced the device PCE to about 4%, with Voc = 0.7 V, Isc = 2.55 mA, and FF = 0.371. Using an invasive plant (Eichhornia crassipes, EC), Pitchaiya et al. demonstrated facile preparation of porous graphitic carbon (GC), which was readily used as an efficient hole transport and back-contact electrode material, thus playing a dual role in PSCs.142 The graphitization and conductivity of the carbon material were improved at three different annealing temperatures (450, 850, and 1000 °C, named EC-G4, EC-G8 and EC-G10, respectively). The highest conductivity, i.e., 115.20 S cm−1, was attained for the highest annealing temperature (1000 °C) compared to 67.33 and 68.05 S cm−1 for 450 °C and 850 °C, respectively, and a surface area of 1000.45 m2 g−1 was obtained for the sample annealed at 1000 °C. The device made with EC-GC10 yielded a PCE of 8.52% with Jsc = 23.49 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.672 V and FF = 0.54. The other two devices, built with EC-GC4 and EC-GC8, exhibited a PCE of 5.97% and 6.38%, respectively. The improved Jsc and FF obtained with EC-GC10 were attributed to the enhanced graphitic phases and porosity of the material. Moreover, the champion device led to better air stability retaining up to 94% of its initial PCE value after 1000 hours under ambient conditions (25 ± 5 °C and 70 ± 5% relative humidity).
A large surface area of 1379 cm2 g−1 was obtained with AC from soybean dregs using KOH as the activation agent.143 In this case, it was observed that using an AC/conductive carbon composite, the perovskite/carbon composite interface quality and charge transfer ability were greatly improved. Thus, when used as a back electrode in carbon-based PSCs, the interface performance was significantly improved and a PCE of 12.05% was obtained, which is 50% higher than that of pure carbon-based PSCs.
Gao et al.144 recently developed economical and eco-friendly bio-carbon PSCs using four different biomass precursors for the preparation of AC (Fig. 8). The precursors are bamboo chopsticks, peanut shells, Phragmites australis, and corn stalks. The biomass precursor was first dried, cut into pieces, and carbonized at 1200 °C for 2 h in a tube furnace, and the obtained carbon powder was ball-milled for 48 h. The amount of carbon produced by this method was 1.5 kg. The authors reported that the main carbon production cost was attributed to electricity consumption during carbonization. The specific consumption energy was calculated to be 0.49$ per kg. The overall performance of biomass-based PSCs depends on the morphology, interfacial connection, work function and sheet resistance of the bio-carbons. Bamboo chopstick AC showed better energy level alignment (suitable work function of 4.8 eV), lower radiative recombination and faster carrier transport. The mixture of bamboo-carbon material and acetylene black was sprayed or doctor bladed over the perovskite layer using chlorobenzene as the solvent, and finally annealed at 90 °C. The device exhibited a PCE of 12.82% maintaining 87% of the initial PCE after storage at room temperature for 2000 hours.

5. Carbon-based photo-supercapacitors
Thanks to the potential use of carbon electrodes in hybrid solar cells, DSCs and PSCs can be integrated with SCs. The interconnection can be categorized into two- and three-electrode systems. In DSCs, in order to avoid electrolyte penetration from the solar cell to the storage subcomponent, the use of an intermediate electrode was proposed. This allowed solving the problem of device short-circuiting or supercapacitor self-discharging. The intermediate electrode can be based on different materials or materials with different sides, one side being used as the electrode for the solar cell and the other side as the electrode for the supercapacitor. To design a photo-charging combined system using PSCs, the electrolyte and electrode materials of the subcomponent devices are also important. On the one side, perovskite solar cells afforded high PCEs and high stability by using a carbon layer as the solid hole-transport material and back contact. On the other side, solid- or quasi-solid biomass carbon-based supercapacitors developed in the last decade can be potentially used on top of a perovskite. Integration within two- or three-electrode systems using a shared electrode connecting both devices is very promising to save energy and improve device portability thanks to a lower weight.
The operational mechanism of the integrated device can be described as follows: under illumination, electrons from the absorber are injected into the electron-acceptor material (TiO2) and flow through the external circuit to the counter electrode where negative charges are accumulated (Fig. 9). At the same time the opposite electrode is used for the accumulation of positive charges, negative ions of the electrolyte are then attracted toward these positive charges, and positive ions are attracted toward the negatively charged electrode. This way, during the charging process, the separation of electrolyte ions is performed and a double layer is created, which reorganizes itself again during the discharge process.
 Fig. 9  Working mechanism of the integrated energy conversion–storage device using PSCs. 
The key parameters for the evaluation of integrated devices are overall efficiency and storage efficiency, extracted from the charge–discharge curves using a direct device connection.145,146 Details of the evaluation process are included in the ESI (Table S2†).

Table 5 summarizes the record conversion–storage efficiencies reached for integrated devices using a shared carbon electrode. The best overall efficiency reported for DSC-integrated devices is 5.12% with a storage efficiency of 84%, while the highest value to date for PSC-integrated devices reached over 10% with a supercapacitor based on C/polypyrrole (PPy) nanofibers/MWCNTs.15,16 The integrated DSC and PSC device evaluation was performed for a small active area, i.e., 0.36 and 0.06 cm2, respectively. Recently, for a robust interconnection formed via electric glue and efficient PSCs with an area of 1 cm2 the PSC/SC integrated device exhibited an overall efficiency of 10.97% and storage efficiency of 80.31%. Those values are the highest reported for integrated self-charging power packs using inverted structure PSCs and supercapacitors based on reduced graphene oxide electrodes and polymer electrolytes (PVA/H3PO4).18

As a reference integrated system, Westover et al. have reported a storage efficiency of 84% (overall efficiency of 12.4%) for an integrated all-silicon solar cell/supercapacitor system with a solar cell operating at 14.8% PCE.147 To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest value ever reported for the overall efficiency of solar cells integrated with SCs.
5.1 Dye-sensitized solar cells/supercapacitors
DSCs have demonstrated the ability to harvest light under critical conditions like on cloudy days or under diffuse light.148,149 Due to the rapid growth of electronic equipment for the Internet of Things, devices capable of self-charging possess great potential for future applications. In this section, we will focus on integrated conversion-and-storage devices using carbon-based shared electrodes (Table 6).

The first integrated DSC device was proposed by Miyasaka et al. in 2004.150 A typical DSC made of a mesoporous TiO2 layer sensitized with a ruthenium dye involved a platinum-coated AC counter electrode to complete the device. The I−/I3− redox electrolyte typically used in DSCs was replaced with a LiI hole-trapping layer covering TiO2. The electrode materials of the AC-based SC were sandwiched and the gap was filled with an electrolyte solution containing 15% TEABF4 in propylene carbonate (PC). After photon absorption by the dye, electron hole pairs are created. Following this, electrons are injected into the conduction band of TiO2 transferred at the counter electrode through the external circuit and accumulated at the surface of porous AC. At the same time, holes react with the LiI layer and positive charges are trapped at the surface of AC as well. This integrated system achieved a maximum charging voltage of 0.45 V, areal capacitance of 0.69 F cm−2 and charge–discharge coulombic efficiency of 80%. The limitation of this system stems from high internal resistance that retards the discharge process, during which electrons must overcome the Schottky barrier at the TiO2 layer. Later, Nagai et al. proposed a new configuration by including an additional electrode to perform efficient charging by redox reactions.151 Inspired by this work, Murakami et al. proposed in 2005 a three-electrode system including an internal bifunctional electrode between the working and counter electrodes, which led to redox electron transfer on one side and charge storage on the other side.152 This configuration afforded a large energy output of 47 μW h cm−2 (a value five times higher than that obtained with the two-electrode system, 9.3 μW h cm−2) with a high charge state voltage of 0.8 V. This improvement was attributed to efficient electron and hole transfer at the Pt/AC electrode.
More recently, a liquid-type DSC using a cobalt-based electrolyte and LEG4 dye was integrated with an asymmetric NiCoOx/AC-based SC to produce a photo-rechargeable integrated system able to generate and store energy.153 Under open-circuit conditions, the DSC provided a voltage of 0.8 V with a PCE of 4.6–4.9%. The asymmetric stand-alone SC provided a specific capacitance of 46 F g−1 corresponding to energy and power densities of 4.1 W h kg−1 and 41 W kg−1. After the integration of the two components, a specific energy of 2.3 W h kg−1 (a specific capacitance of 32 F g−1), and coulombic and total efficiencies of 54% and 0.6%, respectively, were reported for the integrated system.
Due to the liquid solvent used in DSCs, the electrolyte can easily diffuse towards the storage part and thereby cause short-circuits or fast self-discharging. Yang et al. proposed an all-solid-state flexible integrated device in which both a free-standing solar cell and storage device were used in combination with aligned MWCNT films as electrodes (Fig. 10).15

A PVA-H3PO4 electrolyte was used for the storage device and a gel electrolyte based on PVDF:I−:I3− was used for the DSC. A PCE of 6.1% with Voc = 0.750 V, Jsc = 13.41 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.61 was registered for the corresponding DSCs using a MWCNT–polyaniline (PANI) composite as the counter electrode. The specific capacitance of the MWCNT–PANI composite SC was 83 F g−1. After integration in one single device, an energy storage efficiency of 84% and an overall photoelectric conversion of 5.12% were obtained for solidified type photo-SCs.15
On the other hand, Scalia et al. proposed a flexible integrated device composed of a DSC and graphene-based capacitor.158 The DSC and SC electrodes were made of titanium and stainless-steel grids. A methacrylate-based polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) was used after activation by soaking in two different liquid electrolytes, i.e., methoxypropionitrile solution of NaI/I2 for the DSC and aqueous NaCl solution for the capacitor. The PEM was also selected as the electrolyte separator, which guarantees sufficient ionic mobility at ambient temperature, high mechanical robustness and easy sealing of flexible devices. The performance of the flexible integrated device was tested under standard (1 sun) illumination conditions leading to an overall energy conversion of 1.02% and decreasing the light intensity to 0.3 sun led to a maximum storage efficiency of 1.46%. This work nonetheless highlighted the advantages of integrating DSCs and supercapacitors, notably their fabrication easiness, cost-effectiveness of the materials and devices working under low light intensity conditions. These results hold very promising prospects for the industrial scale-up of such integrated devices. Later the same group proposed a two electrode flexible integrated device using a newly developed polymer membrane made of two PEG poly(ethylene glycol)-based sections separated by a perfluorinated barrier.159 One side of this membrane was adapted to enable iodine electrolyte diffusion in the DSC and the other side allowed the capacitor operation, thus using the same electrode for energy conversion and storage. The organic solvent in the DSC and the aqueous electrolyte of the SC could coexist in one single device thanks to the impermeable perfluorinated barrier layer. An overall efficiency of 3.72% with a storage efficiency of 20 mC cm−2 at 3 mA was obtained for this system. To enhance the voltage, Scalia et al. reported a DSC module, i.e., 4 cells in series, connected with an all-solid-state SC based on commercial AC electrodes and a PEO–Pyr14TFSI electrolyte.160 The two subcomponents were integrated into a single device by the hot press method. The DSC module achieved a remarkably high photo-charging potential of 2.45 V. After full charging, a capacity value of over 0.017 mA h cm−2 was obtained for discharging at 1 mA, and an overall efficiency of 1.67% was registered at the maximum power generation of the DSC.
Furthermore, Bae et al.154 proposed an innovative structure involving fiber-based electrodes, using ZnO NWs, and graphene as the active material and electrodes for energy harvesting and storage devices. To improve the device efficiency, further optimization is still needed, for example by matching the pore size of the fiber-based material with the electrolyte ion size or by controlling the density of the ZnO NWs, which is believed to be critical to obtain high performance SCs.
Chen et al. proposed another design using titanium wires as precursor TiO2 nanotubes.155 Aligned CNT fibers were twisted with a modified Ti wire to produce a wire-shaped integrated device that exhibited an overall photoelectric conversion and storage efficiency of 1.5%. The same group further improved this design by the solidification of the so-called “energy fiber device” using an ionic liquid-based DSC and gel-electrolyte SCs.156 A PCE of 2.73% was reported for the DSC, while the energy storage efficiency reached 75.7% with a specific capacitance of up to 0.156 mF cm−1 and power density of 0.013 mW cm−1 at a current of 50 μA. Then Yang et al. developed a coaxial energy elastic type fiber that converts solar energy into electric energy in its sheath and stores energy in its core using aligned carbon nanotube sheets as electrodes.157 The coaxial structure and aligned nanostructure at the interface of the electrode enable a high overall energy conversion (1.83%), which is maintained under bending and stretching. Those papers proved the possibility of fabricating energy fiber devices that can be woven into wearable, self-powering energy textiles.
Finally, a fully flexible printable DSC-SC system was designed by Dong et al., which was capable of efficiently charging a SC to 1.8 V by connecting three DSCs in series.161 Moreover, the performance of the lightweight integrated devices was found to be stable under various extreme bending and tilting conditions in an outdoor test. Under bending (90°) and different tilting directions the voltage increased from 644 mV to 714 mV. This enhancement was attributed to several parameters, one being the deformation of the assembly that may improve the mechanical and electrical contacts at solid–solid interfaces in the device.
5.2 Perovskite solar cells/supercapacitors
As low-cost, high-performance photovoltaics with long term stability, carbon-based PSCs are promising candidates as the energy harvesting part in integrated devices. An activated carbon layer can be easily fabricated and used as a shared electrode between the two sub-devices in the integrated pack (Table 7). Moreover, PSCs have the ability to harvest light efficiently under low-light conditions showing PCE and voltage higher than those of DSCs.148,162 These properties of PSCs make them extremely interesting for a broad range of indoor applications including also self-charging devices for the Internet of Things.

For the first time, Xu et al. integrated PSCs with a MWCNTs-PPy-based SC in series connection (Fig. 11).16 Symmetric SC electrodes with two C/PPy nanofibers/MWCNT films and a cellulose acetate membrane as the separator were assembled. An overall efficiency of 10% was reported for series connected PSCs and SCs. The authors reported a PCE of 20% for the integrated devices, which was obtained when the SC was completely charged. An open-circuit voltage of 1.45 V was registered, which represents a contribution from the SC and solar cells at the same time. Storage efficiencies of about 50% could be obtained by considering the PCE of the integrated solar cells of 20% with the contribution from the charged SC.

A monolithic stacked PSC and solid-state SC were reported a few years later (Fig. 12). An overall efficiency of 10.97% and a storage efficiency of 80.31% were obtained for integrated devices connected via electric glue with large-area inverted-configuration PSCs (1 cm2) and efficient SCs employing reduced graphene oxide electrodes coated with a PVA/H3PO4 electrolyte.18 Graphene oxide was prepared by the pre-oxidation of a natural graphite commercial powder. To the best of our knowledge, this is by far the highest overall efficiency reported to date for integrated power packs.

Graphene electrodes were prepared by chemically converting a graphene dispersion through facile vacuum filtration and implemented into semi-flexible integrated devices.163 Natural graphite flakes were used as the precursor, oxidized and then reduced with hydrazine hydrate in ammonia solution. Self-stacked solvated graphene (SSG) was coated on silver polyimide substrates, and then a H2SO4–PVA electrolyte gel was cast on top of the SSG-modified electrode and dried. Two electrodes were face-to-face assembled before performance assessment. The integrated device exhibited a high specific capacitance of 245 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and retained 83% of its original values after up to 10000 charge–discharge cycles. After the integration of a flexible SC with PSCs, a discharge voltage of 0.75 to 0 V was held for about 45 s at a current density of 1 A g−1. These results demonstrate the possibility of the integration of a flexible solid-state SC with high performance PSCs. Furthermore, an integrated photo-SC device without a connecting wire was proposed by Xu et al. A PEDOT:C electrode bridge was used between a mesoscopic carbon-based PSC and the electrode of a SC.164 The assembled device led to a specific energy of 0.78 mW cm−2, a power density of 7.4 mW cm−2 and a maximum overall efficiency of up to 4.7%. However, the efficiency dropped exponentially after 1 s as the voltage approached that of the solar cell, a trend already observed before.
The integration of PSCs with a SC in a single device was also proved by Liu et al. The connection was possible by fabricating a CNT bridge between the PSC and SC parts.165 The SC electrode material was prepared using super-aligned CNTs in combination with a polyaniline and H2SO4 gel electrolyte. A modified PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) film was used to avoid water penetration from the electrolyte and degradation of the perovskite layer. After successful integration, the device exhibited a storage efficiency of 70.6%.
Liu et al. successfully integrated a PSC and SC into one single device through a shared carbon electrode.166 The optimal solar cell achieved 7.79% PCE with Voc = 0.96 V, Jsc = 15.7 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.52. When the integrated device was irradiated at 1 sun, the storage gradually increased and then remained stable after a short time. The voltage plateau during photo-charging was always lower than the Voc of the PSC, which depends on the internal resistance of the SC. The maximum overall efficiency was found to be 5.26% with a storage efficiency of 76% for the device with an active area of 0.071 cm2 for a charging voltage of 0.84 V.
The high stability and voltage of PSCs were obtained using a CsPbBr3 absorber in a meso-porous configuration combined with a nano-carbon layer as the hole transporting and shared electrode for the integrated device (Fig. 13).167 The nanocarbon electrode was prepared by doctor-blade coating of conductive carbon ink. The inorganic type absorber in a solar cell configuration exhibited a Voc of 1.22 V much higher than that of normal organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs, which is beneficial for the operating voltage of the SC. The SC electrolyte was composed of HCl, TEOS, TEABF4, and concentrated H3PO4. The silica-gel electrolyte was carefully deposited on top of the carbon layer and another carbon layer was again deposited on top of the silica-gel electrolyte before annealing at 70 °C for 60 min to obtain an all-inorganic solar capacitor. The integrated device afforded an overall efficiency of 5.1% and excellent stability after 1000 charging–discharging cycles. Initially the PCE of carbon-CsPbBr3 solar cells was 6.1% for an active area of 0.1 cm2.

It should be noted that after optimization, the reported PCE of carbon-based all-inorganic perovskite solar cells reached over 12%. Recently a record-high PCE of 14.84% (active area of 0.09 cm2) along with excellent storage and operating stability (94%@30 days in air) was reported.168 Therefore, the use of such a device in a monolithic configuration is extremely interesting for high performance and stable integrated packs.
6. Challenges of integrated devices
The photo-supercapacitor technology is in the early stage of development. Researchers have tried various techniques to develop efficient, stable and high-energy PSCs regarding their potential applications in the future. Unfortunately, reported overall efficiencies are considerably low. Many challenges exist and several issues remain to be addressed for the architecture, material capability and the implementation of both devices into a single one through a shared electrode.
The shared electrode is crucial for photo-supercapacitors as it directly influences the overall performance of the device. Selecting electrodes compatible with both solar cells and supercapacitors is key to reaching good performance. A careful choice of the common electrode may reduce electron recombination and enhance the efficiency, provided that the electrode material is stable towards the interconnected films.169 Moreover, bridge electrodes with lower internal resistance can reduce the energy dissipation. Flat monolithic shared electrodes, such as a silver (Ag) film, limit the surface area and therefore reduce the amount of active material for the supercapacitor, leading to low energy storage performance.170 Thus, increasing the surface area of the electrode on the supercapacitor side would be a promising way to achieve higher storage performance.
In the fabrication process, one of the major challenges is the difficulty in the encapsulation of both devices with liquid-based electrolytes, which can reduce the performance and the stability due to leakages or material degradation. In perovskite solar cells, liquid electrolytes may degrade the perovskite film due to moisture and other chemical reactions. Therefore, proper encapsulation is required for better stability of the device.171 Focusing on solid-state and/or quasi solid-state electrolytes for supercapacitors and inorganic perovskite solar cells should be envisaged to enhance the stability of integrated devices.
In practical applications, matching the performance of both solar cells and supercapacitors needs to be considered during the fabrication of photo-supercapacitors. However, in a planar structure, a mismatch may exist between solar cell and supercapacitor devices of the same physical size leading to lower efficiencies.172

Fig. 14 displays the areal capacitance versus solar cell efficiency for reported DSC- and PSC/carbon-SCs. The data included are extracted from the available information in the literature and included in the summary displayed in Table S4.† In some studies, the power generation of the solar cell is higher regardless of storage capacity, while in some other cases storage capacity is higher regardless of solar power generation. This is due to the physical size of one component limiting the performance of the other component.173 As shown in Fig. 14, PSCs/carbon-SCs yield higher power conversion efficiencies, confirming the potential use of PSCs in future integrated devices.
 Fig. 14  Areal capacitance versus solar cell efficiency for carbon-SCs integrated with DSCs or PSCs. 
Researchers pay more attention to increasing the areal capacitance as much as possible to meet practical needs. Two outperforming carbon based SCs with higher areal capacitances can be noticed. An integrated device with a high storage performance of 572 mF cm−2 was fabricated by Xu et al. using MWCNTs as the electrode material.16 On the other hand, Liu et al. have developed an integrated device exhibiting a high storage capacitance of 422 mF cm−2 using a polyaniline/CNT composite as the electrode material.165 This excellent storage performance is due to the pseudocapacitive behavior and the higher conductivity of this composite material.
Another possibility is to increase the storage performance and practically useable voltage requirements through widening the working potential of SCs. In general, considering lower low-power electronics, supercapacitors should be able to deliver at least 40 mW (2 V, 20 mA) to light a red LED.174 Assuming a supercapacitor with an areal capacitance of 500 mF cm−2, working potential of 3 V and zero energy lost, about a 10 cm2 area is required to light a red LED bulb for 5 min.
7. Summary and future prospects
Carbon electrodes have been widely used as electrodes for SCs, DSCs, and more recently PSCs. Biomass as a precursor material for AC is preferable since the manufacturing cost and environmental footprint of the devices decrease. By nature, biomass can provide ACs with a very high surface area and developed porosity with different pore structures, which make them suitable for storage applications. Moreover, due to their high conductivity and favorable band alignment, activated carbons are also well suited to solar cell back-electrodes.
For application as electrode materials in SCs, the textural properties (i.e., surface area, pore size and volume) of ACs can be tuned by an appropriate pyrolysis method or by the nature of the activating agents. Usually, the activation process using strongly basic or acidic chemicals such as NaOH, KOH or H2SO4 provides a higher surface area compared to the simple pyrolysis method using H2O or steam as the activation agent. As an example, a high storage capability of 394 F g−1 and specific energy of 23 W h Kg−1 were obtained for aqueous SCs (6 M KOH) using AC with a surface area of 2793 m2 g−1.5 The latter was obtained from a willow wood source and KOH as the activation agent. The choice of the electrolyte is also an important factor for the fabrication of high-performance SCs with long-term storage stability. Organic electrolytes dominate the market because of their high voltage range. However, due to the volatile nature of organic electrolytes, non-volatile ionic liquids with a high potential window are particularly well-suited to be used as electrolytes in SCs. As a result of wide working potentials, ionic liquids can provide high specific energy compared to aqueous and organic electrolytes. A specific capacitance of 224 F g−1 and specific energy of 92 W h kg−1 were reported with the EMIMBF4 ionic liquid for porous AC electrodes obtained from pine tree and conventional KOH activation.64 Due to the numerous parameters affecting the capacitance of ionic liquid SCs, the capacitance value is usually weaker than that measured for aqueous electrolyte SCs. However, due to their wide potential window the specific energy of ionic liquid SCs is higher than that of aqueous ones, which widens the scope of practical applications.
On the other hand, carbon counter electrodes showed good catalytic properties and long-term chemical and thermal stability in view of replacing expensive Pt counter-electrodes of DSCs. As a carbon precursor material, biomass has attracted huge attention for the mass production of low-cost DSCs. A PCE of 12.72% was achieved, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest value reported for carbon nanomaterials as counter electrodes for DSCs.42 Here, the porous carbon was obtained by KOH activation of an anchovy fish precursor. The porous nature of the material combined with a high electrochemical affinity for the cobalt redox couple yielded such high-performance DSCs, employing SM-315 as the sensitizer. Even though the manufacturing cost of devices is decreasing dramatically, several factors limit the practical use of DSCs. This gap can be filled with new ultrahigh performance solar cells using an organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) as the active component. Thanks to their suitable work function, carbon materials can be used as the counter electrode and hole transport material for PSCs. By removing the spiro-OMeTAD and gold layer and adjusting the porous film configuration, a PCE of 15.7% was reported using carbon as the counter electrode and HTM simultaneously.138 Even if the efficiency of carbon-based PSCs remains low compared to those of standard PSC architectures, the stability was significantly improved to over 14000 hours which makes the device very attractive for industrial applications.
Regarding fully printable carbon-based PSCs, carbon extracted from biomass is considered by many groups as a key precursor for low-cost devices. The highest PCE of 12.82% was reported for a device prepared with AC from bamboo chopsticks.144 Furthermore, by improving the contact between carbon and perovskite layers, the efficiency of biomass-based PSCs could be further enhanced, making them ultra-low-cost solar cell devices. In particular, biomass-carbon PSCs can be efficiently integrated with biomass-carbon SCs for energy conversion–storage devices using a shared carbon electrode. Still, this approach remains overlooked and only a few reports on the integration of carbon-based solar cells with storage devices are found in the literature. A maximum overall efficiency of 5.12% was reported for a carbon-photo-capacitor using a DSC with a 0.36 cm2 active area.15 Following the discovery of PSCs, the highest overall efficiency of over 10% was reported for PSCs/MWCNT/polypyrrole and reduced graphene oxide systems.16,18 However, these results were reported at the early stage of PSCs when the maximum efficiency was still low, 12.6% and 13.66% for an active area of 0.06 cm2 and 1 cm2, respectively.16,18 Highly efficient solar cells with a large active area and optimized designs would be an option to get high overall efficiency integrated devices. Recent progress in carbon all-inorganic PSCs suggests that these devices are interesting candidates for use in integrated packs.167,168 Moreover, research efforts in the evaluation of integrated devices are necessary to report reliable and comparable data. Finally, ultra-low-cost biomass materials for energy conversion-and-storage packs are not yet reported, although this would be a significant research interest in the future. New prototypes need to be designed considering specific applications and using stable high-performance PSCs as energy conversion systems.

His main interests concern the development of functional organic–inorganic hybrid and metal oxide materials for various applications such as photocatalysis, gas sensing and photovoltaic conversion (dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells). Currently he deals with the development of nanostructured and/or porous materials for energy storage and conversion applications.
Ludmila Cojocaru	Ludmila Cojocaru received her PhD from Bordeaux University (France) for her work on the physical chemistry of condensed materials. Subsequently, she worked for two years as a post-doctoral researcher at the Japan Society of Promotion of Science for Foreign Researchers at the University of Tokyo in the framework of the Japanese French Associate Laboratory for the Next Generation Photovoltaic Cells (LiaNextPV) and two and a half years on a national Japanese project at the University of Tokyo. Her work focused on materials synthesis, characterization and application in hybrid solar cell technology including liquid (solid)-state dye-sensitized solar cells and perovskite solar cells. Later, she worked at the Institute of Sustainable Technology of the University of Freiburg (Germany), focusing on the evaporation of perovskites for tandem solar cell applications, work in collaboration with the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy, Germany. Now she is a Junior Researcher at Bordeaux University (France) in an Initiative of Excellence “Make Our Planet Great Again”. Her project is focused on the fabrication of energy conversion–storage devices.
