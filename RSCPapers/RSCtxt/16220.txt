    , Accepted 2nd July 2018First published on 3rd July 2018AbstractUnderstanding and controlling the charge transfer behavior across the interface/junction in hybrid nanostructures is essential for various plasmon-enhanced catalytic reactions. The rational design of plasmonic nanostructures offers a unique capability for eliminating the daunting complexity of the electronic effect induced by interfacial interactions and maximizing the conversion efficiency of solar energy into chemical energy by surface coupling. Herein, we tactfully construct a new type of plasmon-driven photoanode based on plasmonic metal–insulator–semiconductor (PMIS) hetero-nanostructures (Au@SiO2NP-decorated α-Fe2O3 nanorod array), by using Fe2O3 nanoarrays as model semiconductor structures and Au@SiO2 NPs as photosensitizers, for optimizing the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance. The thin insulating layer (SiO2) of the hetero-nanostructure has been found to play a crucial role in significantly enhancing the plasmon-driven water splitting performance via eliminating the negative effect of surface states (resulting in Fermi level pinning and recombination) at the metal–semiconductor interface, suppressing the recombination of current carriers, as well as maximizing the metal–semiconductor barrier height. This study provides new insight into a novel plasmonic nanocatalyst design by rational interface engineering and will be of benefit for a better understanding of manipulating the interfacial electronic properties between plasmonic nanocrystals and semiconductors for catalytic applications.
Introduction
Developing artificial photosynthesis nanosystems using solar energy to produce H2 through photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is an alternative way to address the increasing global energy crisis. Semiconductors are the most common materials used for photocatalysts. However, there is still no single semiconductor that can fulfill all the requirements of solar-driven photocatalytic water splitting, due to the limited light absorption spectral range, low-efficiency charge separation, as well as the high charge recombination rate.1–5 Plasmonics, defined as the collective oscillation of conduction electrons induced by incident electromagnetic radiation, enhances the photoelectric conversion efficiency via direct electron transfer (DET, the so-called hot electron injection),6–8 plasmon induced resonant energy transfer (PIRET),9,10 or resonant photon scattering,11 and could provide a possible solution to circumvent this challenge through subtle interface engineering. In the past two decades, by controlling interfaces/junctions, various functional plasmonic hybrid semiconductor hetero-nanostructures have been designed for broadly exploring the plasmonic effect on PEC water splitting.12–20 Recently, Moskovits et al. reported a gold nanorod-mediated plasmonic water splitting cell, in which 95% of the effective charge carriers derived from the surface plasmon decay to hot electrons through an ingenious design of a Schottky metal/semiconductor interface, which collects and conducts the hot electrons to an unilluminated platinum counter-electrode.21 Conversely, Warren et al. reported a negative result of the influence of plasmonic Au nanoparticles on the water photooxidation performance by embedding Au onto compact Fe2O3 thin films or placing it on the surface of Fe2O3 nanoplatelets.22 When the Au nanoparticles (50 nm diameter) were embedded on the surface of the nanoplatelets, the overall photocurrent decreased due to the surface states and reduced the photovoltage at the Au–Fe2O3 interface, which resulted in significantly enhanced recombination and poor PEC activities.22 These studies manifested the importance of the interfaces (junctions) of hetero-nanostructures for PEC water splitting.
Despite many promising reports on plasmon-mediated PEC water splitting, the interfacial charge transfer behaviors or mechanisms in the hetero-nanostructures are still poorly understood since the daunting complexity of the electronic effect induced by the interfacial effect11,23 is plagued by the introduction of surface states at the metal–semiconductor interface that results in Fermi level pinning22 and numerous plasmonic processes that coexisted spatiotemporally, which severely hindered the development of plasmonic nanocatalysts for effective solar-driven water splitting. In many cases, the electronic properties of such hybrid nanosystems are strongly dependent on their (sub)nanoscale interface arrangement and configuration and therefore very difficult to predict and control. In addition, the Schottky barrier formed between the semiconductor and plasmonic metal nanoparticles may limit the photovoltage and increase surface recombination,22,24 which is unfavorable for solar water splitting. To date, the role of the plasmonic metal–semiconductor interface has not been well-investigated and clearly understood and thus it remains a great experimental challenge.
Among various methods, electronically isolating the plasmonic metal with a thin insulating shell, which eliminates the recombination sites and maximizes the metal–semiconductor barrier height,22 is an efficient way to develop an optimal plasmonic photoanode architecture for water splitting. Very recently, we have revealed a long-range plasmon field and a plasmoelectronic effect on photocatalysis by using shell-thickness tunable and pinhole-free Au@SiO2 core–shell nanoparticles as photocatalysts and p-nitrophenol as a model reactant.25 In the present study, we tactfully constructed a new type of plasmon-driven water splitting photoanode based on plasmonic metal–insulator–semiconductor (PMIS) hetero-nanostructures using hydrothermally prepared Fe2O3 nanorod arrays as model semiconductor structures and the surface-decorated Au@SiO2 core–shell NPs as photosensitizers. Experimentally we found that the thin insulating layer (SiO2) of the Au@SiO2 NPs plays an important role in the resulting hetero-nanostructured water splitting photoanode via avoiding surface states at the metal–semiconductor interface, as well as maximizing the metal–semiconductor (Au–Fe2O3) barrier height, which significantly reduced the recombination of photoelectron–hole pairs and thus enhanced the photoelectrochemical activities on water splitting.
Experimental
Materials
Unless specified, chemicals were used without any further purification. Ferric trichloride hexahydrate was purchased from Aladdin Reagent Company (Shanghai, China). Sodium nitrate, ammonium nitrate and zinc nitrate hexahydrate were purchased from Xilong Scientific Co., Ltd (Guangdong, China). Sodium citrate and sodium silicate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 3-Aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. HAuCl4·4H2O was purchased from Beijing Chemical Factory (Beijing, China). FTO glasses were purchased from Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co., Ltd (Guangdong, China). Water used in all these experiments was purified with a Millipore system (18.2 MΩ cm).
Synthesis of hematite (α-Fe2O3) and ZnO nanorod arrays
The hematite (α-Fe2O3) nanorod array was prepared according to a hydrothermal method reported previously.26 The FTO glasses were cleaned by sonication with water, acetone, ethanol and finally with water for 15 min, respectively. Then FTO was placed in an autoclave (the conductive side was faced downside). The precursor solution contained 0.15 M FeCl3 and 1.0 M NaNO3; the autoclave was heated at 100 °C for 2 h. The obtained yellow iron hydroxide film was annealed at 550 °C for 2 h and then held at 700 °C for 10 min. The ZnO nanoarrays were prepared by a method reported by our group.27,28
Deposition of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs)/Au@SiO2 nanoparticles on α-Fe2O3 (ZnO) nanorod arrays
The 12.5 ± 1.0 nm AuNPs were prepared by the methods reported previously.29 Then the AuNPs were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 20 min and diluted with water to the original volume. Au@SiO2 nanoparticles with different silica shell thicknesses were synthesized by the method reported by our previous work with some modification.25 For silica shell thicknesses of 1.7–2.8 nm, the synthesis process is as follows. Typically, 1 mM APTMS was added to the AuNP solutions dropwise and vigorously stirred for 20 min, then 0.54% Na2SiO3 was added in the sol and heated at 90 °C for a certain time. The Au@SiO2 NPs were obtained by centrifugation (11000 rpm, 30 min) 2 times. To increase the thickness of the silica shell to 6.2 nm, the Au@SiO2 NPs obtained above are diluted to 10 mL with water and then the particles were transferred into 40 mL of ethanol. After the solution was stirred for 5 min, 600 μL of ammonia and 200 μL of 1% tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) were added and this mixture was stirred for 12 h at room temperature. Finally, the solution was centrifuged three times (11000 rpm, 30 min) and redispersed in ethanol. The AuNPs or Au@SiO2 NPs were dropwise deposited onto the α-Fe2O3 nanorod array (or ZnO nanoarrays) and spin-dried at 2000 rpm for 60 s. The dried sample was subsequently heated in the oven at 150 °C for 3 min. This procedure of deposition and annealing is considered as one cycle, and cycles of varied number were tested. Then, the samples were annealed at 450 °C for 2 h.
Characterization
The morphologies of the Fe2O3 nanorod array, ZnO nanoarrays, Au@SiO2 NPs and AuNPs were characterized with an XL30 ESEM scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a JEOL-2100F transmission electron microscope (TEM). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed with a Multimode 8 atomic force microscope (Bruker, Germany) in the tapping mode. The UV-Vis extinction spectra were obtained using a UV-2600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The concentrations of the Au were determined by ICP-OES (Thermo Scientific iCAP6300). X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were conducted with a D8 ADVANCE instrument using Cu Kα radiation (Bruker, Germany). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained using a Thermo ESCALAB 250 instrument. The photoelectrochemical performance was measured in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution with different photoanodes as the working electrode, saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode, and platinum wire as the counter electrode using a CHI 660e electrochemical workstation. The J–V curves were measured with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under the irradiation of a 300 W xenon lamp (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co. Ltd) equipped with an AM 1.5G filter. The intensity of light was 100 mW cm−2. The IPCE was measured under monochromatic irradiation at 1.23 V vs. RHE according to the equation:  ΔI = Ilight − Idarkwhere λ is the wavelength [nm] and Ilight is the photocurrent density under irradiation with light [mA cm−2]. Idark is the photocurrent density under dark conditions [mA cm−2]. P is the incident light power density [mW cm−2].
Results and discussion
The AuNPs with a mean size of ∼12.5 ± 1.0 nm were prepared by a method described previously.29 Au@SiO2 core–shell NPs with different silica shell thicknesses ranging from 1.7 ± 0.3 to 6.2 ± 1.8 nm were then synthesized by the method developed by Tian's group and our previous work.25,30 The silica shell thicknesses can be well controlled by carefully adjusting the reaction time and concentration of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) (Fig. 1). Fig. S1† shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the as-prepared 12.5 nm AuNPs and Au@SiO2 core–shell NPs with varied shell thicknesses diluted in water solutions. The 12.5 nm AuNPs presented a very intense surface plasmon absorption band around 519 nm, which red shifts systematically when coated with silica shells, due to the large dielectric constant of the silica shell.31

The hematite (α-Fe2O3) nanorod array was synthesized onto a FTO glass (substrate) surface according to a well-developed hydrothermal method, followed by annealing at 700 °C.2,26 Fig. S2a† shows that the hematite had a diameter of ∼100–150 nm with a height of ∼100–200 nm (Fig. S3†). AuNPs or Au@SiO2NPs were then dispersed on the surface of the hematite nanorod array by the spin-coating method (Scheme 1). After spin-coating 9 times, the mass ratio of Au/Fe was about 10%. From the SEM mapping images (Fig. S2a–c† inset), it is clearly shown that AuNPs and Au@SiO2NPs were dispersed on the hematite nanorod array uniformly. This is also identified by the TEM images and the corresponding elemental mapping of the as-prepared Fe2O3–Au (F–Au) and Fe2O3–Au@SiO2 nanorod arrays (F–Au@SiO2) (Fig. 2a–g & Fig. S4†). From the HRTEM presented in Fig. 2c, it is clearly seen that a thin insulating silica shell (∼1.7 nm) was sandwiched between a metal and semiconductor, which prevented the direct contact of AuNPs with Fe2O3, and thus constructed PMIS hetero-nanostructures. The crystallinity of the as-prepared hetero-nanostructures was determined from X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. As shown in Fig. S5,† only the characteristic X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks of hematite at 35.61, 54.09 and 63.99 could be observed for different samples owing to the relatively small sizes and low loading amounts of AuNPs or Au@SiO2NPs (JCPDS card number 33-0664). However, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement confirmed the existence of Au (Fig. 3 & Fig. S6†). After the AuNP deposition, the loaded Au 4f binding energy is positively shifted by ca. 0.4 eV compared to that of loaded Au@SiO2NPs (Fig. 3b). This binding energy increase for Au implies that electrons tend to transfer from AuNPs to Fe2O3 until thermodynamic equilibrium is established, due to the difference in their work functions (Au: 5.1 eV, Fe2O3: 4.9 eV).32,33 As a result, the Fermi level of Au will be decreased, whereas the Fermi level of Fe2O3 will be increased. As is known the close contact of a metal with an n-type semiconductor normally creates a Schottky junction, which is consistent with the positive shift of the binding energy for Au.21,34,35 And thus, the electron transfer from AuNPs to Fe2O3, as well as the Schottky junction formation result in the binding energy variation after the close contact of Fe2O3 and AuNPs.36 The UV-Vis extinction spectra of Fe2O3, F–Au and F–Au@SiO2 are presented in Fig. S7a.† After the deposition of AuNPs or Au@SiO2 NPs, the nanostructures show a relatively small peak, due to the low NP (∼10%) loading (see more clearly in the enlarged figure in the inset of Fig. S7a† and the difference extinction spectra in Fig. S7b†), in the wavelength between 500 and 600 nm, which can be associated with the localized surface plasmon excitation.

To assess the influence of the PMIS interface on plasmon-driven PEC water splitting performance, we employed PEC measurements in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte using a three-electrode electrochemical cell under simulated sunlight irradiation (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G). As shown in Fig. 4a, the photocurrent density of the three different samples under simulated solar light irradiation increases with increasing forward bias voltage. Apparently, only very small photocurrent was observed over different samples when performed in the dark, indicative of the essential role of irradiation in triggering the production of photo-induced charge carriers that are responsible for the generation of photocurrent. As seen from Fig. 4a, the F–Au@SiO2 nanorod array (the Au@SiO2 NPs with the thinnest SiO2 shells of 1.7 ± 0.4 nm were used for all plasmonic photoanodes unless otherwise specified) showed significantly enhanced photocurrent density with an enhancement factor as high as 3, in comparison with the hematite alone sample under simulated solar light irradiation, and therefore the result strongly highlighted the substantial photosensitization of the surface-decorated Au@SiO2 NPs. Incidentally, as seen from Fig. 4a, the OER polarization curve of F–Au@SiO2 displays an obvious current fluctuation between 0.6 V and 1.1 V. This is a frequently observed phenomenon during the PEC catalysis processes of water splitting due to the absorption and desorption of reactive species and produced gases.37,38 In our case, this is possibly related to the adsorption, followed by the strong PEC oxidation of OH− on the surface of Fe2O3–Au@SiO2, as well as the formation and desorption of O2.16,37 The on–off transient photocurrent responses of the three different samples at 1.23 V vs. RHE are shown in Fig. 4b. Upon light irradiation, all the three tested samples immediately showed a steep rise in photocurrent, followed by a transient decay. This might be caused by the defect sites that formed on the Fe2O3 surface, which might serve as the main recombination sites for photogenerated electron–hole pairs.39 The as-prepared samples displayed a good stability after the PEC water splitting experiments, as shown by TEM, XRD and XPS characterization (Fig. S8†).

As shown in Fig. S9,† the photocurrent increases with more Au@SiO2 NP deposition, but after the successive deposition of Au@SiO2 NPs for 12 cycles (the mass ratio of Au/Fe reaches ∼17%), the photocurrent of the resulting anode slightly decreased; this effect might be ascribed to the excessive coating of the NPs on the semiconductor, which weakens the absorption of pristine hematite and then offsets the photocurrent enhancement. Notably, though the deposition weight of AuNPs is similar to that of F–Au@SiO2 (10%), only a small increase of photocurrent for the F–Au hetero-nanostructures was observed (Fig. 4a & b). This result seemed counterintuitive since under the resonant excitation of the LSPR of the AuNPs, hot electron transfer from the metal to the semiconductor occurs during the decay of surface plasmon excitation, which can improve the photoelectrical catalytic performance efficiently. However, it would be reasonable considering the several possible electronic and electrochemical effects caused by the close contact between AuNPs and Fe2O3, including the formation of surface states and a different band structure in the vicinity of the metal nanoparticles. These effects may promote surface recombination of carriers and lower overall performance.22,40 As bare AuNPs are larger than 10 nm and not electronically isolated from the semiconductor, a high density of surface states can result in Fermi level pinning, which aggravates the recombination of current carriers and thus deteriorates the PEC performance of the resulting heterogeneous electrode.41
To examine these possibilities, photocurrent transient dynamics were further analyzed to quantitatively determine the charge recombination behavior of different samples by introducing a normalized parameter (D):2,42 D = (It − Ist)/(Iin − Ist)(1)where It, Ist and Iin are the time-dependent, steady-state and initial photocurrents, respectively, as shown in Fig. S10.† The transient time constant (τd) is defined as the time when lnD = −1 in the normalized plots of lnD–t (Fig. 4c), which reflects the general behavior of charge recombination, as well as the lifetime of the charge carriers. For the PMIS hetero-nanostructures, τd was estimated to be ∼0.75 s, which was 3 times that for Fe2O3 without the AuNPs (∼0.25 s), indicating the suppressed charge recombination. The increase of transient time constant was not due to the surface catalysis of Au, as AuNPs have been electrically isolated by the compact silica shell and the onset potential (in Fig. 4a) did not decrease with the incorporation of Au@SiO2 NPs. In addition, the transient time constant of F–Au is only ∼0.29 s (slightly larger than that of hematite), possibly due to the additional high density of surface states at the metal–semiconductor interface after the direct deposition of AuNPs, which augments the charge recombination.
The photocurrent enhancement of the PMIS hetero-nanostructures may stem from the charge density increase and the reduced recombination of carriers. This was further confirmed by the Mott–Schottky (M–S) performance of the as-prepared photoanodes. Note that the slopes of the linear parts in the M–S results (Fig. 4d) are positive, which suggests typical n-type semiconductor behavior and agrees with LSV results (Fig. 4a). According to the following formula:16 Nd = (2/eε0ε)/[d(1/C2)/dU]−1(2)where e = 1.6 × 10−19 C, ε0 = 8.854 × 10−12 F m−1, ε = 80 for α-Fe2O3,43 and C is the capacitance. The carrier density (Nd) of Fe2O3, F–Au and F–Au@SiO2 nanostructures is estimated to be 1.5 × 1023, 2.3 × 1023 and 3.0 × 1023 cm−3, respectively. Apparently, due to the plasmonic effect and effective elimination of the negative effect of surface states, Nd of the F–Au@SiO2 nanorod array is larger (corresponding to a minimum slope in the M–S curve) than that of Fe2O3 and F–Au, which significantly contributes to the enhanced PEC water splitting performances.
Recently, the open-circuit photovoltage decay measurement has been proven to be a powerful method to examine trap-state-mediated electron–hole recombination.44 In order to have a better understanding of the roles of the PMIS hetero-nanostructures in reducing the recombination of carriers, we collected open-circuit photovoltage–time spectra (Fig. 4e) and calculated the decay lifetime of each anode sample by fitting to a biexponential function with two time constants (τ1 and τ2):45 y(t) = A0 + A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2(3) τm = (τ1τ2)/(τ1 + τ2)(4)where τm is the harmonic mean of the lifetime and the half-life is log(2 × τm). In our experiments, the half-life of Fe2O3, F–Au and F–Au@SiO2 was calculated to be 2.31 s, 1.77 s and 1.32 s, respectively. The rapid photovoltage decay of the F–Au@SiO2 anode suggests that the integration of Au@SiO2NPs could possibly remove the trap state on the surface of pristine Fe2O3 and reduce the loss of holes via electron–hole recombination efficiently. Although the rapid decay rate also indicated a large charge carrier recombination probability, the elimination of surface states may play a more important role in enhancing the PEC water splitting in our catalytic system. As seen from Fig. 4e, the photovoltage of the F–Au@SiO2 anode (∼80 mV) is much larger than that of the Fe2O3 and F–Au anodes. The large Voc of Fe2O3–Au@SiO2 is a response for maximizing the metal–semiconductor barrier height, preventing the hot electrons created by SPs from returning to the plasmonic metals,22,39,46 which may be another reason for the super PEC performance of F–Au@SiO2.
The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured at 1.23 V (vs. RHE) to elucidate the role of LSPR in the enhanced photocurrent (Fig. 4f). Possibly due to the short hole diffusion length (2–4 nm), a short lifetime of charge carriers (<10 ps) and poor mobility of charge carriers (<0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1) of α-Fe2O3,2 the IPCEs of the samples exhibit very small values. But the F–Au@SiO2 anode showed a substantially enhanced IPCE in the wavelength range from 420 to 600 nm when compared with hematite on bare FTO. Since the IPCE enhancement followed the spectral overlap of the plasmon and Fe2O3 (band gap ∼ 2.1 eV), the dominant plasmonic energy transfer mechanism was most likely to be the PIRET. To examine this possibility, pristine control ZnO nanoarray electrodes with or without the modification of Au@SiO2 NPs (Fig. 5a & b) were prepared. Despite the integration of Au@SiO2, the PEC performance is lower for the ZnO–Au@SiO2 anode, compared with the parent ZnO nanoarrays, due to no spectral overlapping between ZnO and AuNPs, as well as partial coating of active sites on ZnO (Fig. 5c & d).9,10,47 Besides, we also changed the silica shell of the Au@SiO2 NPs from 1.7 nm to 6.2 nm (Fig. 1) and performed the PEC test of the F–Au@SiO2 anodes systematically (Fig. 6). With the increase of the silica shell, the photocurrent decreased gradually, which is consistent with the distance dependency of the plasmon-enhanced electric field. The nearly exponential decay of the plasmon-driven electromagnetic field gives rise to the decrease of the photoelectrocatalytic activity with the increase of the SiO2 shell thickness. Apparently, the PIRET efficiency is strongly dependent on two factors: (i) the distance between the energy donor (metal) and the energy acceptor (semiconductor), and (ii) the spectral overlap between the plasmonic resonance band and the semiconductor's absorption band. Therefore, the results show unambiguously that the great enhancement of the PMIS hetero-nanostructures on PEC water splitting is mainly associated with the mechanism of PIRET.

Based on the results presented above, the mechanism of plasmon-driven PEC water splitting enhancement on the PMIS hetero-nanostructures was proposed, as depicted in Fig. 7. When Au@SiO2 NPs are anchored on the surface of the Fe2O3nanorod arrays, AuNPs were electronically isolated by the thin insulating SiO2 shell and formed a PMIS hetero-nanostructure (Fig. 2c). Upon irradiation by light, the excited LSPR contributes to a large electromagnetic enhancement and improves greatly the excitation efficiency and the transient time of hematite through PIRET, as well as reduces the probabilities of carrier recombination.48 Notably, the thin insulating silica interface plays an important role as an energy barrier that eliminates the possible electrical effect and maximizes the metal–semiconductor barrier height (Fig. 4e), which may prevent the hot electrons that are created by SPs from returning to the plasmonic metals (process IV) and instead transfers to the surface of the semiconductor. However, when AuNPs directly come into contact with Fe2O3, the possible creation of surface states at this interface may result in Fermi level pinning and thus promote recombination, despite the positive contribution from the coupling between the LSPR and the semiconductor, which would be observable in the spectral response of the photocurrent (Fig. 4b) or the IPCE spectra (Fig. 4f).

Conclusions
In this work, we carefully investigated the influence of the nanoscale catalyst interface on plasmon energy conversion by tactfully engineering a new type of PMIS nanostructured anode. The PMIS anode exhibited an enhanced PEC water splitting efficiency when irradiated with light (AM 1.5G). We speculate that the great improvement was mainly attributed to the LSPR electromagnetic field enhancement via the mechanism of PIRET. The thin insulating layer (SiO2) plays an important role in eliminating the negative effect of surface states (resulting in Fermi level pinning and promoting recombination) at the metal–semiconductor interface, as well as maximizes the metal–semiconductor barrier height. This study provides new insight into a novel plasmonic nanocatalyst design by rational interface engineering and will be of benefit for a better understanding of manipulating the interfacial electronic properties between plasmonic nanocrystals and semiconductors.
