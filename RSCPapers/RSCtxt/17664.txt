    , Accepted 6th December 2022First published on 7th December 2022AbstractPhotocatalytic water splitting is considered to be a promising renewable solution to the energy crisis and environmental problems as an inexhaustible clean energy source. Graphene has an ultrahigh carrier mobility, but the zero gap limits its practical application in the photocatalysis field. Graphane has a wider band gap and retains a high carrier mobility, which demonstrates its great potential in this field. However, the broad band gap results in low photocatalytic efficiency. In this work, we propose two effective ways to modulate its electronic structure, modifying the structure of graphane and constructing a heterojunction using density functional calculations. We systematically investigated four trilayer graphane (tri-G) conformers and designed in-plane (lateral) and out-of-plane (vertical) heterojunctions with tri-G and chair-G (cha-G), the two most stable graphanes, with theoretical prediction. The results show that tri-G not only has a smaller band gap, falling in the ultraviolet range, which enhances the UV-light catalytic performance, but also has tunable band edge positions, locating outside the reduction potential of hydrogen and oxidation potential of water. Furthermore, the calculated electron effective mass for the tri-G conformers is smaller than that of cha-G. What's more, the band gap, band edge position, and photocatalytic efficiency are further optimized by constructing heterojunctions. In particular, both the in-plane and out-of-plane tri-G-C/cha-G heterostructures are confirmed as direct band gap semiconductors and type-I heterostructures exhibiting special band alignment, meanwhile satisfying the requirements for water splitting. And the band gaps of the heterostructures are further reduced. In addition, metal doping is expected to further optimize their electronic structure. These results provide theoretical support and a feasible modulation strategy for developing graphane as an effective photocatalyst for water splitting.
1. Introduction
With the development of modern society, energy shortages and environmental pollution caused by the massive consumption of fossil fuels have become the focus of world attention.1 Direct hydrogen production by driving photocatalytic water splitting using solar energy, an inexhaustible and clean energy source, is considered to be a promising renewable solution to the energy crisis and environmental problems.2,3 In the photocatalytic process, a stable and efficient photocatalyst is a key factor to achieve high hydrogen production.
Since TiO2 was first discovered as a photocatalytic nanomaterial in 1972,4 a large number of two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene,5,6 phosphorene,7–9 metal oxides,10,11 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),12,13 metal-free catalysts such as g-C3N414,15 and various heterostructures,16–27 have also been reported as heterogeneous photocatalysts for water splitting. It was found that these 2D materials have unique structural and physical properties compared with their corresponding bulk counterparts.28 In addition, 2D materials can also manifest distinct characteristics through the formation of heterostructures, surface modification and so on.29–31 In particular, the large surface–volume ratios and high carrier mobilities make 2D materials highly promising as a new generation of photocatalysts.7
As a photocatalyst for splitting water to produce hydrogen, the 2D materials must have a suitable band gap and band edges.32 In particular, the catalysts most suitable for photocatalytic H2 evolution must have a conduction band (CB) more negative than the reduction potential of H+ to H2 (0 eV) and a valence band (VB) more positive than the oxidation potential of H2O to O2 (1.23 eV).33 In addition, enhanced optical absorption, a high carrier mobility, and low photogenerated electron and hole recombination rates are also required to achieve efficient hydrogen generation. Unfortunately, many 2D semiconductor materials do not meet all the conditions although they possess good photoelectronic properties.23 Therefore, it is meaningful but challenging to explore novel and promising 2D materials as high-efficiency photocatalysts for water splitting.
Following a successful exfoliation in 2004,34 graphene has attracted considerable interest due to its unique structural and special electronic, optical and transport properties. In particular, graphene is well-known as a 2D material with one atom thickness, a high carrier mobility, excellent electrical conductivity and huge specific surface area.35 These extraordinary properties make graphene a potential material for application in photocatalysis. However, the zero gap of graphene limits its applications as an efficient photocatalyst. This has encouraged scientists to seek possible strategies, such as exposing graphene sheets to hydrogen plasma to obtain hydrogenated graphene.31 Since then, several new configurations of graphane have been synthesized (chair, boat, twist-boat, stirrup and armchair).36 In contrast to graphene, graphane is a semiconductor with a wide band gap that has good insulation properties. The high performance of graphane is due to its high surface area that includes more active sites for reaction. However, its broad band gap results in low photocatalytic efficiency.
Recently, we proposed four trilayer graphane with three atomic sub-layers in the monolayer, namely tri-G, all of which are direct semiconductors with band gaps larger than 3.3 eV (PBE)/4.2 eV (HSE06). One of these four trilayer graphane conformers has the lowest binding energy, being only 0.02 eV per atom higher than that of cha-G, the most stable one among all graphane conformers theoretically predicted. This implies that tri-G may coexist with cha-G during the experimental synthesis of graphane. The CB edge potential of tri-G is more negative than the redox potential of H+/H2, indicating that tri-G has strong reduction power for H2 production. Compared to the conventional bilayer graphane with two atomic sub-layers in the monolayer, tri-G has a smaller band gap and wider absorption in the ultraviolet (UV) region. Also, tri-G possesses a high photogenerated carrier mobility and high electronic conductivity, which enable the enhancement of photocatalytic performance. Therefore, tri-G is expected to be an efficient photocatalyst. Meanwhile, in order to improve the photocatalytic performance of graphane, we considered combining tri-G and cha-G to form heterojunction structures. In heterostructures, the charge accumulation/depletion around the interface causing the formation of a built-in electric field will promote effective separation and migration of electrons (e−) and holes (h+), which improves the photocatalytic activity. And the construction of heterojunctions further reduces the band gap of the pristine monolayer graphane, which is favorable for the migration of electrons. Thus, we report novel in-plane (lateral) and out-of-plane (vertical) heterostructures with two-dimensional tri-G and cha-G using first-principles calculations. The tri-G/cha-G in-plane and out-of-plane heterostructures are found to possess direct band gaps and a type-I band arrangement. Moreover, high carrier mobilities are also identified in the in-plane and out-of-plane heterostructures, even higher than that of two-dimensional monolayer graphane. More remarkably, both the band gap and band edges of the in-plane and out-of-plane heterostructures can meet the requirements of the reduction and oxidation levels in water splitting. These results confirm these in-plane and out-of-plane heterostructures as promising candidates for application in next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices. In addition, the band offset of type-I heterostructures can be further expanded with metal Al/Li doping, which is beneficial for photocatalytic performance. In this work, we have systematically investigated the crystal structures and electronic properties of tri-G using first principles and carefully evaluated its photocatalytic behavior. Two-dimensional in-plane and out-of-plane heterostructures were constructed to explore their electronic properties in anticipation of expanding the range of applications of two-dimensional graphane. Our results provide great potential for applications in the field of photocatalytic and optoelectronic device materials.
2. Computational details
In this paper, all the crystal structure optimizations and energy calculations were carried out with density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP)37 module and executed using ultra-soft pseudo-potentials. All electrons contributing to the exchange-correlation energy were treated via the generalized gradient approximation within the scheme of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE).38,39 The vdW density functional correction procedure proposed by Tkatchenko and Scheffler (TS-vdW)40 was adopted in our calculations to describe the long-range vdW interactions. The cutoff energy for the plane-waves was chosen to be 600 eV. A sufficiently large vacuum space (20 Å) was applied to avoid any interactions between neighboring layers. During geometry optimization, when energy dropped to 5.0 × 10−6 eV per atom, maximum force reduced to 0.01 eV Å−1 and maximum stress fell to 0.02 Gpa, convergence was considered to be achieved. A Monkhorst-Pack centered k grid was used with the following requirements: set “c” in the vacuum direction to 1, and make sure that both the “a” and “b” actual spacings were approximately equal to 0.03 Å−1. For Brillouin-zone sampling, we used 4 × 7 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point meshes for cha-G; 4 × 13 × 1 Monkhorst-pack k-point meshes for tri-G-A, tri-G-B, tri-G-C and tri-G-D; 2 × 7 × 1 and 4 × 7 × 1 Monkhorst-pack k-point meshes for the in-plane heterostructures and out-of-plane heterostructures. The setting of cutoff energy and k-point was performed based on a convergence test. The standard for determining cutoff energy and k-point under the convergence test was that if the precision of cutoff energy and k-point was further improved, the energy changes were within 2 meV per atom. To evaluate the structural stability of the four monolayer polymorphs, the phonon dispersion of all four monolayer polymorphs was performed. As well as the band structure, density of states (DOS) and optical property calculations, we also carried out additional Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)41 screened hybrid functional calculations, which typically give a better description of band gaps in semiconductors to compensate for the underestimation of the PBE functional.42
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structures and stabilities of tri-G
In ref. 43, we originally predicted four graphanes with three atomic sub-layers in the monolayer. The four graphanes are named tri-G-A, tri-G-B, tri-G-C and tri-G-D in this work, corresponding to γδ-G, αγ-G, βγ-G and αδ-G in ref. 43. After geometry optimization, only three of them show trilayer structures with three atomic sub-layers in the monolayer. The top and side structures of geometrically optimized monolayer tri-G are shown in Fig. 1. From the side views of the four graphanes, only observing C atoms, it is clear that tri-G-A, tri-G-B and tri-G-C have trilayer structures and tri-G-D does not (for a uniform description, it is still named tri-G), though the trilayer structure of tri-G-B is not so orderly. The trilayer structures of tri-G-A and tri-G-C are like repeated bilayer upward and bilayer downward steps, and the step gradient of tri-G-A is slightly larger. From the top views of tri-G, it can be noticed that they all exhibit interfaces consisting of buckled 6-membered rings. Compared with tri-G-B and tri-G-D, tri-G-A and tri-G-C have more neat crystal structures, and each six ring is of equal size (visually). The numbers of atoms of the shaded parts that represent original units are 32 (C16H16), 16 (C8H8), 16 (C8H8) and 40 (C20H20) for tri-G-A, tri-G-B, tri-G-C and tri-G-D, respectively. The lattice parameters are shown in Table 1.

Before investigating the electronic properties of tri-G, we first evaluated the stability of the tri-G monolayers. In order to study the dynamic stability of tri-G, the phonon dispersion of the tri-G monolayers was calculated, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Clearly, the frequency values of all branches are positive and no imaginary phonon vibration frequencies exist, confirming the dynamic stability of the tri-G monolayers. The stability of these new structures was further verified by molecular dynamics, using ab initio MD simulations within the canonical ensemble (NVT) at 300 K for 5 ps with a time step of 1 fs.44 The corresponding results, which are plotted in Fig. S2 (ESI†), show that these monolayers can maintain their stable crystal structures and the potential energy fluctuations of all structures are very small at 300 K. Furthermore, to predict the feasibility of the experimental fabrication of the tri-G monolayers, the binding energy (Eb) of the specific conformer having n number of C and n number of H atoms in one unit cell was calculated using the following formula: (1)where Etot represents the total energy of the specific tri-G conformer, ECa represents the energy of a single C atom, and EHa represents the energy of a non-spin-polarized single H atom. The binding energy (Eb) values of tri-G together with the energy difference (ΔE*) of different tri-G relative to cha-G are listed in Table 1.
Regarding the thermodynamic stabilities of the tri-G conformers, we evaluated them by comparing their binding energies (Eb) with those of the known graphane. Among the four graphanes, tri-G-C is the most stable with a binding energy of −6.66 eV per atom, having an intermediate stability Eb between the previously reported chair graphane (chair-G) and stirrup graphane, and the energy difference to cha-G is only 0.02 eV per atom.43 This indicates that cha-G and tri-G-C may co-exist in the process of preparing graphane by hydrogenation of graphene. In this work, we focus on the photocatalytic water splitting performance of these graphanes compared to cha-G, and the photocatalytic properties of the in-plane and out-of-plane heterojunctions constructed with tri-G and cha-G. The photocatalytic performance is closely related to the band structure. In order to ensure that this study is a comparative study with the same computational accuracy, the electronic properties such as the band structures and partial density states of these graphanes were recalculated. And the results are as follows.
3.2 Electronic properties of tri-G
Because photocatalytic activity is directly related to the electronic structure of materials,45 the electronic band structures of tri-G along the high symmetry directions were calculated with both PBE and HSE06 functionals, as presented in Fig. 2. The band structures demonstrate that the tri-G conformers are all direct band gap semiconductors, which is beneficial to photocatalytic efficiency. The obtained band gaps are about 3.553 eV (PBE)/4.486 eV (HSE06), 3.344 eV (PBE)/4.231 eV (HSE06), 3.362 eV (PBE)/4.245 eV (HSE06) and 3.692 eV (PBE)/4.602 eV (HSE06) for tri-G-A, tri-G-B, tri-G-C and tri-G-D, respectively. The band gap obtained by this work is consistent with those obtained before. Therefore, the electrons (e−) are directly separated from holes (h+), which can increase the probabilities for photogenerated e− and h+ to participate in photocatalytic reactions.46

To further understand the electronic properties, the total and partial DOSs of tri-G were calculated, as shown in Fig. 3. According to the results, both the s orbital and p orbital contribute to the states of the valence band region and the contribution of the p orbital to the total DOS is far greater than that of s orbitals around the Fermi level. The valence band maximum (VBM) is mainly contributed from C p orbitals, and the conduction band minimum (CBM) primarily results from H s orbitals. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the shapes of the PDOS distribution curves of the s orbitals and p orbitals in the valence band region are very similar, which indicates that the s orbitals and p orbitals are hybridized, favoring the enhancement of covalent bonding. Covalent bonding is more favorable for carrier transportation than ionic bonding.47

To investigate the chemical bond properties of tri-G, the Mulliken charge transfer, bond populations and electron density difference were also calculated. Bond population is an important parameter that can be used to analyze the ionic and covalent character of chemical bonds. The value of bond population is between 0 and 1. Zero bond population implies an ideal ionic bond. The contribution of covalent interaction to chemical bonds increases with increasing bond population value.48 The Mulliken populations of C atoms and H atoms are −0.21 and 0.21, respectively. Each C atom takes 0.21 electrons, while each H atom loses 0.21 electrons, indicating a partial ionic interaction in the chemical bonds between H and C atoms. The C–H bond populations are all greater than 0.5 and close to 1 (Table S1, ESI†), indicating that the C–H bonds mainly involve covalent interaction. To show these results more clearly, the electron density difference was calculated and is shown in Fig. 4. Obviously, the four tri-G conformers are still characterized by sp3 hybridized orbitals with electrons gathering around the C–C and C–H bonds, which are illustrated by electron gain (blue) and loss (yellow).

Photocatalytic activity is affected by the mobility of the photogenerated carriers.49 High mobility implies fast transport speeds of electrons and holes from bulk to surface, which can reduce the recombination probability of electrons and holes within a semiconductor and increase photocatalytic activity.48 Theoretically, the mobility of photoexcited carriers can be indirectly assessed by the effective masses of electrons and holes, which can be calculated according to the following equation:50 (2)where m* is the effective mass of electrons or holes, k is the wave vector, ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, and v is the transfer rate of photogenerated charge carriers. Generally, a smaller effective mass means a higher migration ability and lower recombination probability of carriers. To obtain new insight into the photogenerated carrier mobility in tri-G, the effective masses of electrons  and holes  along designated directions were calculated by fitting parabolic functions around the CBM and VBM according to the following equation: (3)where E is the band edge energy as a function of wave vector k, and the positive and negative signs correspond to the effective masses of electrons and holes, respectively. The results are shown in Table 2; the effective masses of electrons and holes are different, which may result in a significant difference in mobility between the electrons and holes. This large mobility difference is beneficial to the separation of electrons and holes, reduction of their recombination rate, and enhancement of the photocatalytic activity.48 Also, the large effective mass difference  between e− and h+ can expedite e− and h+ migration and separation, which enhances the photocatalytic performance. Moreover, the effective mass of electrons in the four tri-G conformers is smaller compared with that in cha-G, as shown in Table 2. Therefore, the high mobility carriers enhance the charge transfer process, which may be related to the trilayer structure. The improved electron transitions and transport properties of tri-G appear to arise from the substrate itself.

3.3 Photocatalytic mechanism of tri-G
The positions of the conduction band (CB) edge and valence band (VB) edge of a semiconductor photocatalyst are an important factor for effective photocatalytic water splitting. Usually, the locations of the VBM and CBM determine the oxidation and reduction capabilities of photogenerated e− and h+, respectively.51 The reduction potential level of the electron-acceptors should be energetically below the CBM, whereas the oxidization potential level of the electron-donors should be above the VBM.52 Photocatalytic oxidation is mainly attributed to the participation of superoxide radicals (O2˙−), hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), and photogenerated holes (h+).53 To understand the photocatalytic mechanism of tri-G, the reduction and oxidation potentials of the CBM and VBM at the point of zero charge can be calculated following the equations:54 ECB = χ − EC − (Eg/2)(4) EVB = ECB + Eg(5)where ECB and EVB are the potentials of the CB and VB edges, respectively. EC is the free energy corresponding to the hydrogen scale, and the value is ∼4.5 eV;54Eg and χ are the band gap and the electronegativity of the semiconductors, respectively. χ is defined as the geometric mean of the absolute electronegativities of the constituent atoms. The absolute electronegativity of an individual atom is the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionization energy.54 The calculated ECB and EVB values of tri-G are listed in Table 3.

Fig. 5 shows the probable energy level diagram (potential vs. NHE), displaying the relative positions of the CB and VB edges for the four tri-G conformers, together with the redox potentials for O2/H2O and H+/H2. The downward shifted CB bottom lies below the redox potential of H+/H2 (0.0 eV), whereas the VB top lies above the O2/H2O redox potential (1.23 eV).47 For H2 evolution, the CB edge potential of a photocatalyst must be more negative than the redox potential of H+/H2, and the reduction power depends on the position of the CB edge. From Fig. 5, it can be clearly seen that the CB edge potentials of tri-G are more negative than the redox potential of H+/H2, indicating that the tri-G conformers have strong reduction power for H2 production. Generally, both an appropriate band gap width and suitable CB edge position together contribute to an optimal H2 production activity under light irradiation. Therefore, an optimal balance between the light absorption capacity and the reduction power in an investigated material leads to a higher efficiency of light-driven photocatalytic H2 production.

Moreover, the second important factor determining the efficiency of photocatalysts is the optical band gap width, determining the range of light absorbed. For photocatalytic water splitting, the optical band gap of a photocatalyst material must be large enough to overcome the endothermic character of the water-splitting reaction, i.e. larger than 1.23 eV.15 The absorption of light drives the transfer of e− from the VB to CB, creating e−/h+ pairs that can then migrate to the surface to contribute in oxidation and reduction reactions, respectively.48,51 Therefore, we calculated the absorption spectra (Fig. 6) to estimate the optical energy band gap value as the intercept between the x axis and the dotted red line in the larger panels of Fig. 6. According to Fig. 6, we can conclude that the absorption edges of the investigated materials locate at the positions of λ = 274.3 nm, λ = 291.0 nm, λ = 299.5 and λ = 264.9 nm, and the optical band gaps were estimated (λg = 1239.8/Eg(optical)) to be 4.52 eV, 4.26 eV, 4.14 eV and 4.68 eV for tri-G-A, tri-G-B, tri-G-C and tri-G-D, respectively. These results correspond well with UV irradiation and a sufficient negative CB potential for H+/H2 reduction. For direct optical transitions, [I(ω)]2 (S1) is linearly related to photon energy (hν) in the absorption edge region, whereas for indirect optical transitions, [I(ω)]1/2 is linearly related to hν.48 The data plots of [I(ω)]2versus photon energy in the absorption edge region are shown in the insets of Fig. 6. It is clear that [I(ω)]2versus hν is linear in the absorption edge region. Therefore, the absorption edges of the tri-G conformers are caused by direct optical transitions.

3.4 Structures and stabilities of in-plane and out-of-plane heterojunctions
The optimized lattice parameters of cha-G are a = b = 2.46 Å, and γ = 120°, and those of tri-G-C are a = 8.50 Å, b = 2.52 Å, and γ = 90° (Table 1). These parameters are consistent with the values reported in previous experimental and theoretical studies.43 To realize a small lattice mismatch between the two components, a 1 × 2 tri-G-C supercell composed of 16 C atoms and 16 H atoms was constructed, and its lattice parameters are a = 8.50 Å and b = 5.04 Å, as shown in Fig. 7(a). Meanwhile, rhombic monolayer cha-G was redefined into a  rectangular supercell containing 16 C atoms and 16 H atoms with the diagonal as the unit edge, and its lattice parameters are a = 8.52 Å and b = 4.92 Å, as shown in Fig. 7(b). The mismatch rates of lattice “a” and “b” of cha-G and tri-G-C are 0.2% and 2.4%. Both the in-plane and out-of-plane heterojunctions were constructed and adapted to the average lattice parameters of the cha-G and tri-G-C supercells. In geometry optimization, the lattice parameters were fixed and only the atoms were relaxed. In this work, the tri-G-C/cha-G in-plane heterostructure was modeled by in-plane splicing of tri-G-C with cha-G phases. The in-plane heterostructure can be constructed along the zigzag and armchair directions. Tri-G-C is a form of trilayer graphane with three atomic sub-layers in the monolayer (Fig. 7(c)), whereas conventional bilayer graphane (cha-G) has two atomic sub-layers in the monolayer (Fig. 7(d)). The cha-G and tri-G-C bond connections along the zigzag direction could not be matched exactly, leading to dangling bonds for the upper or lower sub-layer atoms in tri-G-C, which results in significant deformation after geometry optimization. Therefore, considering the stability of the structures, we will focus on the tri-G-C/cha-G in-plane heterostructure formed along the armchair direction, as shown in Fig. 7(e and f). Moreover, due to the diversity of the out-of-plane heterostructure, it is necessary to consider the different stacking configurations. The final geometry optimization results showed that the most stable pattern for the tri-G-C/cha-G out-of-plane heterostructure is built by placing monolayer cha-G above the surface of monolayer tri-G-C, as shown in Fig. 7(g and h). Therefore, the most stable pattern of the tri-G-C/cha-G out-of-plane heterostructure is researched in the following. Finally, the equilibrium vertical distance in the out-of-plane heterostructure is 1.94 Å, which conforms to the structural characteristics of a vdW heterojunction, indicating that a vdW interaction is established between cha-G and tri-G-C. And the bond length at the interface of the in-plane heterostructure is 1.540 Å.

The feasibility and stability of the proposed tri-G-C/cha-G heterostructures can be assessed by the interface adhesion energy (Eadh), which is defined as Eadh = E(tri-G-C/cha-G) − E(tri-G-C) − E(cha-G)(6)where E(tri-G-C) and E(cha-G) represent the total energies of the monolayer tri-G-C and monolayer cha-G, respectively. E(tri-G-C/cha-G) is the total energy of the tri-G-C/cha-G heterostructure after full relaxation. The calculated interface cohesive energy of the tri-G-C/cha-G in-plane and out-of-plane heterostructures is −1.8 eV and −1.6 eV, respectively, indicating that the formation of tri-G-C/cha-G is an exothermic process, suggesting that the in-plane and out-of-plane heterojunctions are thermodynamically stable.
3.5 Electronic properties of the in-plane and out-of-plane heterojunctions
The band structures of the tri-G-C and cha-G monolayers are shown in Fig. 8(a and b), respectively. We can clearly see that for tri-G-C and cha-G, both the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) locate at the Γ point, forming 4.245 eV and 4.482 eV direct band gaps at the HSE06 level, respectively. The obtained results are in close agreement with recent theoretical reports.43,55 Next, the electronic band structures of the tri-G-C/cha-G in-plane and out-of-plane heterostructures were calculated, as shown in Fig. 8(c and d). For the tri-G-C/cha-G in-plane and out-of-plane heterostructures, both the VBM and CBM are still located at the Γ point. And the tri-G-C/cha-G in-plane and out-of-plane heterostructures exhibit smaller direct band gaps of 3.902 eV and 4.061 eV, respectively. As we know, compared to indirect-band gap systems, the direct-band gap heterostructures are expected to exhibit a higher solar energy conversion efficiency.

To get deeper insight into the electronic properties of these two systems, we further examined their density of states. Fig. 9(a and b) show the total density of states (TDOS) and the partial density of states (PDOS) of the tri-G-C/cha-G in-plane and out-of-plane heterostructures, respectively. Tri-G-C and cha-G are both formed with covalent bonds with sp3 hybridization (Fig. 3), which was reconfirmed by the similar contributions of C-p and H-s orbitals to the VB in Fig. 9(b). In the out-of-plane heterostructure, tri-G-C and cha-G retain their isolated crystal structure consisting of six-membered rings of C atoms, so the C-p contribution to the VB is very similar for tri-G and cha-G. The VBM of the tri-G-C/cha-G in-plane and out-of-plane heterostructures is mainly composed of C-2p orbitals of tri-G-C, whereas the CBM of the tri-G-C/cha-G in-plane and out-of-plane heterostructures is mainly composed of H-s of tri-G-C, which implies a spatial constraint on the electrons and holes and a typical type-I band alignment. Such type-I heterostructures are favorable for practical applications in light-emitting diodes and semiconductor lasers.56,57

From top to bottom: (a) the TDOS of the tri-G-C/cha-G in-plane heterostructure, and corresponding PDOS of tri-G-C and PDOS of cha-G in the tri-G-C/cha-G in-plane heterostructure. (b) TDOS of the tri-G-C/cha-G out-of-plane heterostructure, and corresponding PDOS of tri-G-C and PDOS of cha-G in the tri-G-C/cha-G out-of-plane heterostructure. The Fermi energy was set to 0. 
To probe the charge transfer in the in-plane and out-of-plane heterostructures, we also investigated the electron density difference, which is defined as Δρ = ρ(tri-G-C/cha-G) − ρ(cha-G) − ρ(tri-G-C).58 Here ρ(tri-G-C/cha-G) is the total electron density of the in-plane and out-of-plane heterostructures, and ρ(cha-G) and ρ(tri-G-C) are the electron densities of the corresponding isolated cha-G and tri-G-C monolayers, respectively, at the corresponding position in the heterostructures. Fig. 10 shows the three-dimensional electron density difference of the tri-G-C/cha-G in-plane and out-of-plane heterojunctions. The electron density difference clearly shows that the electrons are redistributed by the formation of electron-rich and hole-rich regions. In these two three-dimensional views, the blue and yellow regions represent electron accumulation and depletion, respectively. As shown in Fig. 10(a), an obvious electron accumulation around the C–C bonds appears at the interface, characterizing the covalent bonding between tri-G-C and cha-G, while the blue and yellow regions distributed in the interlayer space between cha-G and tri-G-C in the tri-G-C/cha-G heterostructure sufficiently disclose the interfacial interaction in the out-of-plane heterostructure. It should be pointed out that the isosurface values shown for the in-plane heterostructure (0.03 e Å−3) and out-of-plane heterostructure (0.0006 e Å−3) have a two-orders of magnitude difference, which indicates a difference in the strength and nature of the interaction between cha-G and tri-G-C in the two heterojunctions. As a result, covalent bonding interaction occurs in the construction of the in-plane heterostructure, while the out-of-plane heterostructure is dominated by weak van der Waals (vdW) interaction between different layers.

The value of isosurface for the in-plane heterostructure was set as 0.03 e Å−3, and the value of the isosurface for the out-of-plane heterostructure was set as 0.0006 e Å−3. The blue and yellow regions represent electron accumulation and depletion, respectively. 
In this study, the effective masses of electrons  and holes  in the heterostructures were also studied, which can give a quantitative description of the transfer ability of electrons and holes along specific directions in the heterostructures. This will be another criterion to judge whether the heterojunctions have potential in photocatalysis, by determining whether the heterojunctions enable or prevent electron and hole transport. The calculated  and  values of the CBM and the VBM along the armchair direction are listed in Table 4. Both the electron effective mass and the hole effective mass in tri-G-C and the heterojunctions are significantly smaller than those (1.086 for  and 0.723 for ) of conventional graphane (cha-G), while the hole effective mass in the in-plane and out-of-plane heterojunctions is smaller than that in tri-G-C. As we all know, it is easier with smaller effective masses to transfer carriers to the reactive sites in photocatalytic reactions. Moreover, from Table 4, we can see clearly that the effective masses of electrons and holes have a large difference, indicating effective separation of e−/h+ pairs and a small probability of recombination for the photogenerated carriers.

The band alignments of the tri-G-C/cha-G in-plane and out-of-plane heterostructures were determined using NHE as an energy reference. As shown in Fig. 11(a), the calculated band alignments revealed the formation of type-I heterojunctions, which is favorable for practical applications in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Furthermore, the band edges of both the tri-G-C/cha-G in-plane and out-of-plane heterostructures can straddle the water redox potential. The work function of a crystalline solid is an important parameter and is widely used as an intrinsic reference to predict the type of band gap alignment.17 The calculated work functions of the tri-G-C and cha-G monolayers are 4.54 eV and 4.63 eV (Fig. S4, ESI†). Additionally, the calculated work functions of the tri-G-C/cha-G in-plane and out-of-plane heterostructures are 4.48 eV and 4.51 eV, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†). It can be seen that the work functions of the constructed heterostructures are lower than those of both individual monolayers, which indicates a strong interaction at the interface.17 Moreover, for the work function of the out-of-plane heterostructure, the large potential difference (ΔV = 5.6 eV) between tri-G-C and cha-G indicates a strong built-in electric field around the interface (Fig. S4, ESI†). This behavior leads to extensive modification of the electronic band structure near the Fermi level.59

In the tri-G-C/cha-G heterostructures, as shown in Fig. 11(b), all the photogenerated carriers are likely to leap from the cha-G layer to the tri-G-C layer. Therefore, the photogenerated electrons and holes in the tri-G-C layer cannot escape, which is useful for building light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The conduction band offset (CBO) and valence band offset (VBO) between the tri-G-C and cha-G layers are 0.12 eV, respectively. With these band offsets, both electrons and holes excited in the cha-G layer transfer to the tri-G-C layer, whereas the carriers excited in the tri-G-C layer are prevented from interlayer transfer because of their lower energies. Hence, the photogenerated electrons and holes are likely to recombine again, which is valuable in LED applications.17 The band alignments, i.e. the conduction band offset (CBO) and valence band offset (VBO), are key parameters in determining the electrical and optical properties of a heterostructure, and they have a significant effect on the transport properties of the carriers at the interface. Metal doping was applied to further narrow the band gap and widen the band offsets, and it was confirmed as an efficient method to modulate the band gap substantially to a lower value in tri-G-C. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), two approaches were adopted for doping, i.e. Al-doping replacing C atoms and Li-doping replacing H atoms.60,61 As the concentration of dopants (atomic ratio) increased, their corresponding band gaps decreased, as shown in Fig. 12. For the Li doped systems, the band gap decreased from 2.080 eV to 0.953 eV (Fig. S6, ESI†). With Al doping, the band gaps change sharply, with the calculated value decreasing from 2.674 eV to 0.542 eV (Fig. S6, ESI†). Moreover, we calculated the work function of Li-doped and Al-doped tri-G-C with different doping concentrations and obtained the corresponding band alignment. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the calculated work functions of Li-doped tri-G-C and Al-doped tri-G-C are lower than that of tri-G-C. According to eqn (6), the calculated potentials of CB and VB edges of doped tri-G-C are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). It is obviously that the band offsets become larger. As a result, metal doping is a favorable way to tune the band gaps and widen the band offsets, and it can be applied to improve the photocatalytic water splitting performance of heterojunctions. On the other hand, effective mass is another factor that should be taken into consideration. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the band gap of doped tri-G-C is effectively reduced, however the doping flattens the bands around the band gap, making the effective mass (Table S2, ESI†) larger compared to the undoped systems, and this will reduce the efficiency of water splitting. Here, the emerging flat states around the Fermi energy should be localized defect states. To enhance the photocatalytic water splitting by doping, deeper investigations of the defect states should be performed. All in all, to ensure that the band gap of tri-G-C is greater than 1.23 eV for efficient photocatalysis and that its reduction potential of H2 and oxidation potential of H2O match well with those of cha-G, the concentration of doped Li should be less than or equal to 6.25% while the concentration of doped Al should be less than or equal to 3.13%.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we systematically explored the photocatalytic performance in water splitting of tri-G and tri-G-C/cha-G in-plane and out-of-plane heterojunctions based on first-principles calculations. The calculation highlights that: the CB edge potential of tri-G is more negative than the redox potential of H+/H2, indicating that tri-G has strong reduction power for H2 production. The CBM and the VBM of tri-G straddle between the reduction potential of H2 and oxidation potential of H2O. And the absorption edge of tri-G locates in the UV region with strong absorption. Thus, tri-G possesses an appropriate band gap width and suitable CB edge position together, which leads to a higher efficiency of light-driven photocatalytic H2 production. The calculated electron effective mass of the tri-G conformers is smaller than that of cha-G. Moreover, the in-plane and out-of-plane heterojunctions possess direct band gaps with type-I band arrangements and further the energy band can be modulated, which is useful in electronic devices. Both the band gap and the band edges of these two systems can meet the requirements of the reduction and oxidation levels. What's more, the calculated effective carrier masses of tri-G and the heterostructures are small enough to guarantee fast transfer of the photogenerated carriers to participate in their separate half-reactions in the photocatalytic process. And their large effective mass difference between e− and h+ can facilitate e− and h+ migration and separation and finally improve the photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the calculated hole effective mass for the in-plane and out-of-plane heterojunctions is smaller than that of tri-G, while the in-plane heterojunction has a smaller one than that of the out-of-plane heterojunction. Therefore, the use of heterostructures is an effective method to enhance e−/h+ separation and reduce their recombination. In brief, these four graphane conformers possess a suitable band gap width and meet the requirements to be efficient photocatalysts, and their electronic structure can be further optimized by forming both types of heterojunctions. The final study shows that metal doping can further optimize the band structure. These results are of guiding significance for developing graphane as an effective photocatalyst for water splitting. We hope that our work will broaden the scope of two-dimensional graphane and provide ideas for exploring new photocatalytic materials.
