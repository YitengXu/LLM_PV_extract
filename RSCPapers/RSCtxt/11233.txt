    , Accepted 15th February 2017First published on 15th February 2017AbstractThe development of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells is one of the most rapidly growing fields in the photovoltaic community and is on its way to challenge polycrystalline silicon and thin film technologies. High power conversion efficiencies can be achieved by simple processing with low cost. However, due to the limited long-term stability and environmental toxicity of lead in the prototypic CH3NH3PbI3, there is a need to find alternative ABX3 constitutional combinations in order to promote commercialization. The Goldschmidt tolerance factor and the octahedral factor were found to be necessary geometrical concepts to evaluate which perovskite compounds can be formed. It was figured out that the main challenge lies in estimating an effective ionic radius for the molecular cation. We calculated tolerance factors and octahedral factors for 486 ABX3 monoammonium–metal–halide combinations, where the steric size of the molecular cation in the A-position was estimated concerning the total charge density. A thorough inquiry about existing mixed organic–inorganic perovskites was undertaken. Our results are in excellent agreement with the reported hybrid compounds and indicate the potential existence of 106 ABX3 combinations hitherto not discussed in the literature, giving hints for more intense research on prospective individual candidates.
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites with the general formula ABX3 have attracted great attention as light harvesting materials for the next generation of photovoltaics. Since their first use as a photoactive absorber material in 2009,1 power conversion efficiencies (PCE) have already increased to a certified value of 22.1%,2 thereby competing with established thin-film PV technologies like cadmium telluride (CdTe) or copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS).3 The most studied hybrid compound is methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3), which exhibits a band gap (Egap) of approximately 1.55 eV, enabling light absorption across almost the whole visible solar spectrum (up to a wavelength of ∼800 nm). MAPbI3 shows unusually long charge carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths of roughly 100 nm for the pure iodide (MAPbI3)4 and more than 1 μm for the mixed halide (MAPbI3−xClx),5 while the absorption coefficient is estimated to be 10 times higher than that of a conventional organometallic dye.6 The possibility of producing thin films by simple and cheap solution fabrication routes, together with low charge carrier recombination rates comparable to those of typical direct Egap semiconductors (like e.g. GaAs),7 render them prospective as a superior photoconductor in the future solar cell technology. In 1958, the first crystallographic studies on pure inorganic CsPbIX3 (X = Cl−, Br− or I−) were carried out by Møller et al., confirming its 3-dimensional perovskite structure analogous to the parental calcium titanate (CaTiO3).8 20 years later (1978), Weber was the first to prepare a hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite by replacing Cs+ with the organic CH3NH3+ (MA+) cation9 and in 2014 the first report was published in which a formamidinium (FA+) lead trihalide ([NH2]2CHPbX3), with an auspicious Egap of 1.48 eV for the iodide, was used as the light absorber in a high efficiency perovskite solar cell.10 In the ABX3 perovskite structure, the A-position is coordinated by 12 and the B-position by 6 anions (X−), respectively. The inorganic cesium or the organic molecular cations are usually more bulky than the divalent metal (B2+) and occupy the cuboctahedral cavity formed by the BX3− inorganic framework, whereas the B2+ metal ion is located in the octahedral position (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Ideal cubic perovskite crystal structure. The large cation (green) in the cuboctahedral A-position is Cs+ or a small molecular organic cation, the smaller B2+ metal cation (white) is typically Pb2+ or Sn2+ and coordinated by six anions (red, usually Cl−, Br− or I−) forming an octahedral geometry. 
In order to assess the stability of 3D perovskite ABX3 structures, in 1926, V. M. Goldschmidt introduced a so called “tolerance factor” (TF),11 a geometrical parameter which relates the ionic radii of the elemental constituents of the compound (eqn (1)): (1)where rA, rB and rX are the effective ionic radii of the A, B and X ions respectively. This semiempirical relationship was initially developed to study the stability of oxide perovskite compounds,12 but is now also used to predict possible halide perovskites.13 It is based on the idea of dense ionic packing of the ABX3 crystal structure with early guesses of ionic radii (based on coordination grid analysis).11 Empirical results indicate that 3D structures form when TF is in the range of 0.76–1.13.11,13–18 Mostly cubic structures are formed for values of TF in the range 0.8–1.0, though for TF = 0.76–0.90 the octahedral perovskite network can be distorted. Even lower values for TF result in a situation where the cations A and B get similar in size, whereby the A cation comes in too close contact with the halides. Thus, mainly covalent bonds are formed, leading to the formation of a different structural type like e.g. ilmenite (FeTiO3). For values of TF larger than 1, the perovskite structure gets highly distorted, while TF > 1.13 usually results in layered structures with face-sharing octahedra. These lower dimensional perovskites exhibit large Egaps and stronger exciton binding energies making them unsuitable for use in single junction solar cells. However, they show potential application as top absorbers in tandem solar cell structures and are of main interest in ion-conducting or ferroelectric applications. The class of layered perovskite compounds was extensively reviewed by Mitzi, with 1D or 2D structures exhibiting interesting ferroelectric, pyroelectric, magnetic and semiconducting properties.19
It was recently found that mixing of different cations with different steric demands in the A position leads to modified effective ionic radii and to changed TFs which lie between that of the single cations, respectively. For example, the lattice constant of a 1:1 mixed MA+/FA+ perovskite showed a value half way between the parameters observed for the single cation compounds. This indicated that solid solutions of different perovskites can be formed and physical properties may be investigated as a function of lattice parameters. Furthermore, the mixed cation compound not only improved the overall photovoltaic performance, but also promoted a better long-term stability under an ambient atmosphere.19,20
However, the TF alone is not sufficient for the prediction of stable ABX3 compounds. An additional consideration is whether the B site cation has the appropriate size to be coordinated by six anions and can therefore fit into the octahedral void. Assuming the hard sphere model and non-overlapping anions, the minimum radius for the B-cation in sixfold coordination is 0.414rX (rX being the anionic radius).13 To evaluate the fit of the B-cation into the respective halide octahedron (X6), the octahedral factor “μ” is defined as: (2)
Due to the chemically soft character of halide anions, the ability to coordinate a metal cation is of equal importance and allows, together with the TF, a 2D mapping of stability criteria for ABX3 perovskite compounds.
A controversial discussion about the long-term stability as well as about the reliability of PCEs for perovskite solar cells is caused by the often observed hysteresis in current-density–voltage (JV) curves. Inconsistent assumptions have been published about the cause for this adverse photoresponse. Giorgi et al. stated that the large dipole moment of the organic cation induces a ferroelectrically triggered hysteresis, which could be avoided by the use of cations with zero dipole moment, like guanidinium (GUA+).21 However, Eperon et al. found a strong hysteresis also when using zero dipole Cs+ in the A-position, suggesting that ferroelectricity is not a necessary condition to induce hysteresis.22 A recent study revealed that the motion of MA+ in MAPbX3 is too fast to be associated with hysteresis and hypothesized that it is due to polarization of ionic charges in the perovskite layer under the influence of the applied as well as the built-in voltage.23 These results indicate that the motion of the organic cation does not significantly contribute to the observed hysteresis. However, more information about the causes and possible strategies, how to avoid them, is needed, since hysteresis behavior causes a low stability of halide perovskites and complicates the determination of the “real” performance of a solar cell.
ABX3 structural and compositional modification
Due to their tunable optical Egaps, unusually long charge carrier lifetimes for both, electrons (e−) and holes (h+) and small exciton binding energies,4,5 3-dimensional ABX3 perovskites are potentially similar to bulk semiconductors in thin film solar cells and several attempts have been made to customize the absorber properties.
The most studied route to tune Egap is the modification of the inorganic metal–halide network by using different halide contents (usually Cl−, Br− or I−). Several studies have shown that Egap can be finely altered when using defined mixtures of MAPbI3−xClx, MAPbBr3−xClx or MAPbI3−xBrx.24–26 However, since only the metal–halide framework is responsible for the long charge carrier lifetimes, while the organic cation does not contribute energetically to relevant density of states (DOS) near the Egap,27,28 it can be attempted to modify the optoelectronic properties without changing the BX3−-network. Filip et al. found theoretically that the Egap in APbI3 compounds varies by simply acting on the equatorial and axial angles of the PbI6 octahedra via the size of the organic cation and that Egap can be changed by nearly 1 eV if these range from 120° to 180°.27 Affirmatively, it was found that the use of FA+ led to larger Pb–I–Pb bond angles which resulted not only in a red-shifted absorption onset (Egap ∼ 1.48 eV), but also in a better stability in air and moisture compared to MAPbI3.10 Furthermore, Eperon et al. reported a strong blue-shift for CsPbI3 (Egap ∼ 1.73 eV),22 indicating that the cation size sequence Cs+ < MA+ < FA+ leads to the expected systematic decrease of Egap.
The main challenge in estimating criteria for the stability of 3D perovskites by means of evaluating TFs, is the determination of a “real” ionic radius for the molecular cation. Due to hydrogen-bonding and van der Waals interactions which result in varying bond lengths, the steric size changes with respect to the anionic counterpart. This makes it hard to define an effective radius, even for symmetric cations such as NH4+ or (CH3)4N+.14
Hydrogen bonding from the organic cation to the inorganic BX3−-network occurs mainly via N–H-groups and only minor via C–H-groups, in accordance with the higher electronegativity of nitrogen compared to carbon, and additionally confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the interatomic distances in o-MAPbI3 by Lee et al.29 These findings indicate that molecular cations with more than one amino group (e.g. guanidinium or azetidinium) exhibit statistically higher probabilities of forming H-bonds, thereby enlarging the steric demand and affecting the rotational freedom of the molecular cation. Several theoretical and experimental values for the effective ionic radii of the most common molecular cations (MA+, FA+) were determined, ranging with quite a large variation from 1.8 to 2.7 Å for MA+ and from 2.2 to 2.79 Å for FA+.10,14,27,30–32 Kieslich et al. calculated the ionic radii of 11 simple organic cations by taking crystallographic data and adding the empirical anionic radius of the atom with the largest distance to the center of mass (excluding hydrogen's).14 These semiempirical radii were then used to calculate the TFs and predict the formation of hypothetical 3D perovskite structures. Filip et al. performed DFT calculations on 22, primarily hypothetical, compounds in a 3D perovskite structure to determine TFs via quantifying the steric size of the cations by taking into account a sphere which included 95% of the electron density.27
Microwave analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), neutron diffraction and DFT calculations along with Monte Carlo simulations on the dynamics of NH4+, MA+ and FA+ revealed highly disordered orientations of the cation in the high temperature cubic phases.25,26,28,29,33–42 In the low temperature phases, energy barriers created by H-bonds or BX6 distortions cannot be overcome since the thermal energy of the cation rotation is too low. This leads to preferred orientations of the molecular cation.
We performed first-principles calculations on the steric sizes of 18 simple organic monoammonium compounds, in order to explore potential candidates substituting the commonly used MA+ or FA+ cations in the hybrid perovskite solar cell community. Due to contradicting assertions for the effective ionic radii of MA+ or FA+ in the literature, the ammonium cation is still the simplest example and the only non-atomic cation for which plausible numbers are published. Its ionic size dramatically changes with the coordination number.43 Thus, to estimate an effective ionic radius of each considered cation here, we calculated its total electron density and related the isocharge density to the NH4+ cation, whose isocharge density was chosen in a way, that it fits the experimental radius in cuboctahedral coordination.44 For that, the center of mass of the molecule was calculated in the optimized geometry and the electron density was allowed to freely rotate around it. The radius of the sphere which contained the complete isocharge density was taken as the effective ionic radius and used to calculate the TF. For a detailed description of quantum mechanical calculations, software utilized45–47 and related choice of an appropriate level of theory and basis set, see the ESI.† Although a statistically reliable success rate is hard to justify with only 40 hybrid ABX3 compounds being published and compared to our stability criteria, we can show that these fit very well to experimental and theoretical results, revealing conformity of 88% (yet 93% if Ge-containing outliers are neglected). Since rotational freedom of the molecular cation is assumed, this approach is especially useful for predicting hypothetical 3D perovskite compounds in their most symmetric high temperature phases. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first intense survey about hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite compounds.
Tolerance factors, octahedral factors and literature survey
Tolerance factors and octahedral factors were calculated for 18 molecular cations (see Fig. 2) in combination with 9 divalent metals (Ge2+, Sn2+, Pb2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Tm2+, Sm2+, Yb2+ and Dy2+) and three halides (Cl−, Br− and I−), resulting in 486 hybrid organic–inorganic ABX3 combinations (for a full list of TFs and μs, see the ESI†). The commonly utilized Shannon radii for metal ions were determined from oxide and fluoride compounds only,48,49 therefore we used the 9 largest accessible revised cation radii (Table S3, ESI†) proposed by Travis et al.50 Only these 9 metals revealed ionic sizes which led to appreciable numbers of potential 3D ABX3 phases with the considered molecular cations. The revision of the ionic radii takes into account the greater covalency in metal–halide bonds when moving from strongly electronegative elements (O2− and F−) to less electronegative and chemically softer halides (Cl−, Br− and I−, see Table S4, ESI†). The influence of the increasing covalency is an observed shortening of bond lengths compared to Shannon bond lengths.50 Our approach is an expansion to the investigation of hybrid perovskites by Travis et al. who calculated revised metal ion radii and applied the semi-empirical effective ionic radii for molecular cations proposed by Kieslich et al.14 The latter were determined through a combination of crystallographic data and empirical values for anionic sizes, while in this report steric dimensions were completely calculated from first principles and also include charge density provided by hydrogen atoms.

A plot of TF against μ can be constructed to evaluate the suitability of A and B cations together with an X anion for the potential formation of ABX3 perovskite structures. The TF–μ plot of all 486 considered combinations is shown in Fig. 3. The 40 experimentally or theoretically investigated crystal structures are represented as crosses, whereas not reported ABX3 combinations are depicted as diamonds. The lower boundary of the TF for ABX3 formation was set at 0.9 (NH4CaCl3 has a TF of 0.905 and still adopts a 3D ABX3 structure) and the upper boundary at 1.12 (DiMAPbI3 has a TF of 1.129 and is just not forming a 3D ABX3 phase). The minimum μ was kept at 0.414. We found a strong correlation of 35 out of 40 compounds (∼88%) being predicted correctly into forming or non-forming 3D ABX3 structures. Considering the unusual behavior of the Ge2+ lone-pair and ignoring the two compounds not residing in the predicted stability range despite forming 3D perovskites (blue crosses), a coincidence of 37 out of 40 compounds (∼93%) is observed.
 Fig. 3  2D mapping of calculated tolerance factors and octahedral factors for 486 hybrid ABX3 compounds. 18 organic cations are combined with 9 divalent metals and three halides. The empirical stability range for 3D perovskite formation (1.12 < TF > 0.9 and μ > 0.414) is framed with a dashed rectangle. Molecular cations larger than isopropylammonium (isoPA+) reveal tolerance factors being too large to allow formation of 3D ABX3 networks. Published experimental or theoretical structurally characterized compounds are marked as crosses. Green crosses indicate reported 3D perovskites, red crosses denote lower dimensional phases. Blue crosses show Ge-containing compounds existing as 3D structures. Unreported compounds are presented as diamonds. The diagram considers geometrical parameters only, effects of N–H or C–H bonding on the effective steric demands for molecular cations are not incorporated. 
An overall of 121 compounds fall within the predicted stability range, with 17 compounds already characterized experimentally or theoretically. The results indicate that for larger cations (>isoPA+), the TF-concept does not support the formation of 3D perovskite structures (TF > 1.12) and these combinations will probably reorganize into lower dimensional (1D or 2D) networks. The SrI3− inorganic network provides the largest cuboctahedral void due to the large sizes of Sr2+ (1.16–1.18 Å) and I− (2.20 Å), while GeCl3− holds the smallest enclosing volume in line with the small sizes of Ge2+ (0.73–0.77 Å) and Cl− (1.81 Å). Therefore, SrI3− is expected to yield the largest number of stable 3D perovskite phases (although Sr2+-incorporation was found to significantly increase the Egap compared to Pb2+, due to an upward shift of the conduction band),51 while combinations of smaller metals and halides (e.g. Ge2+ or Yb2+ with Cl− or Br−) will result in supportable network distortions only with the smallest organic cations like NH4+, HY+ or HA+.
Within the perovskite community, NH4+ and MA+ cations are the best known crystal constituents for the A-position with MA+ being the most prominent one for solar cell application in the recent years. For the NH4+ cation, several reports appeared about perovskite structures in combination with group IV metals and halide anions. These phases are usually low in dimensionality and range from colorless high Egap salts with isolated trigonal pyramidal BX3− units to NH4CdCl3 type crystals with double chains of distorted BX6 octahedra.52–61 Although GeX3− anionic frameworks show appropriate TFs in combination with NH4+ (0.93, 0.96 and 0.97 for X = I−, Br− and Cl− respectively), these structures do not form 3D phases at room temperature (NH4GeBr3 is not reported yet), along with the small μs (0.35, 0.37 and 0.40 respectively). It was suggested that Ge2+ has a stronger tendency to reduce the symmetry in order to maintain space for the free electron pair, while this is not the case for Sn2+ and Pb2+.59 On the other hand, MA+ is well known to build 3D perovskite phases with low Egaps, suitable for photovoltaic application. Their crystal structures range from cubic phases at room temperature with PbCl3−, PbBr3− and SnBr3− networks (pseudo-cubic with PbI3−),33,62 to less symmetric phases observed for other tin and germanium halides.63–67 The latter combinations commonly show phase transitions to more symmetric crystal networks at higher temperatures. MACaI3 and MASrI3 have recently been investigated. Theoretical results indicated that both, MACaI3 and MASrI3 form stable phases with similar formation energies and cell parameters compared to MAPbI3,51,68 while the properties of MACaI3 have also been experimentally verified.68 In accordance with these results, our calculated geometrical parameters for both compounds are in the predicted stability range. However, Ca- and Sr-containing perovskites are not expected to show appropriate Egaps for single junction solar cells. These compounds are more appropriate for further exploration of electronic properties like dielectricity or ferroelectricity if not, furthermore, the interchange of the organic cation would lead to a decrease of Egap revealing potential application as top cells in tandem architectures.
HY+ shows suitable TFs (0.92–1.11) throughout the complete metal–halide combinatorial system. Except for HYPbI3 and HYPbBr3, there are no structural reports about hydrazinium trihalometallates until now. It was theoretically found via DFT calculations that in combination with lead, Br− and I− compounds have similar TFs like the corresponding MA+ structures resulting in 3D perovskite networks.69 Our calculations agree with TFs of 1.00 and 0.96 for the Br− and I− respectively, which are roughly ∼4% smaller than TFs of the MA+ combinations (1.04 and 1.00 for MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 respectively). A HYPbCl3 (TF = 1.05) compound is not reported to date.
HA+ also indicates several possible 3D perovskite structures in combination with all metals and halides except for GeCl3− (TF > 1.12). The only crystallographic study about hydroxylammonium perovskite compounds was a theoretical structure prediction of HAPbI3.70 DFT calculations rendered HAPbI3 to be a possible standardized perovskite structure and an alternative absorber for MAPbI3.
FA+ is expected to yield 3D perovskite structures with Sn2+ and Sr2+ as chlorides (TFs of 1.09 and 1.09) and bromides (TFs of 1.08 and 1.07) and with Sn2+, Pb2+, Sr2+, Tm2+, Sm2+ and Dy2+ as iodides (TFs of 1.11, 1.09, 1.04, 1.12, 1.06 and 1.11 respectively). It was found that FAPbBr3 has a tetragonal structure at room temperature showing an Egap of 2.13 eV (ref. 71 and 72) (although FAPbBr3 has a TF of 1.14), while FAPbI3 appears as a cubic phase with an Egap of 1.48 eV (ref. 73) (TF = 1.09). FAPbCl3 was not fully characterized until today (only XRD available74,75) and is not expected to exist as a 3D phase (TF = 1.15). FASnI3 was found to exist as a cubic structure at room temperature,76 making it attractive as a lead free alternative to FAPbI3. Recently, Koh et al. successfully applied FASnI3 as the absorber in a mesoscopic solar cell, showing a PCE of 2.1%.77 Furthermore, according to Shockley–Queisser analysis,78 the Egap of 1.41 eV is more appropriate for single junction solar cells than that of FAPbI3 (1.48 eV). Except for FAGeI3, there are no structural reports about further perovskite-like formamidinium trihalometallates. FAGeI3 has a TF of 1.18, being too large to support the formation of a symmetric 3D perovskite. This is confirmed from the observed 3D trigonal phase with strong rhombohedral distortion.67
Due to the similar effective ionic radii of FA+ and GUA+ (2.77 and 2.80 Å, respectively), the GUA+ cation should, in terms of geometrical considerations, result in similar structures compared to FA+. In combination with Sn2+ and Sr2+, the GUA+ cation has appropriate TFs of 1.1 and 1.09 as chlorides and 1.08 as bromides, respectively. With Sn2+, Pb2+, Sr2+, Sm2+ and Dy2+ as iodides the TFs are 1.12, 1.09, 1.05, 1.07 and 1.12, respectively. However, FAPbI3 is known to adopt a 3D perovskite structure at room temperature, while GUAPbI3 does only at high temperatures.79 H-Bonding is likely to play a major role influencing the effective ionic radius with regard to the surrounding inorganic framework. Since GUA+ has three amino-groups (one more than FA+), providing roughly a one third higher probability of forming H-bonds, the rotational disorder is likely to be hindered at room temperature. Giorgi et al. confirmed via theoretical calculations, that the introduction of a third NH2 group might result in frustrated rotation of the bulky GUA+ cation in the cuboctahedral cavity at low temperatures.21 Anyway, it is generally accepted that the rotational freedom of the organic cation increases with increasing temperature, associated with an increase in symmetry (the high temperature phases are often cubic). The thermal energy enables overcoming of the potential barriers, which are related to H-bonding-caused preferred molecular orientations inside the cuboctahedral hole. Therefore, GUAPbI3 might exist as a high temperature 3D phase, as it is actually indicated by the work of Szafranski.79 He observed a phase transition with an associated color change from yellow to reddish above 432 K with a related release of a large amount of transition entropy. This implication of a strong ordering of the (meta-stable) high temperature phase, together with the decrease of Egap, indicates a more symmetric higher dimensional phase for GUAPbI3. Except for GUASnCl3, there are no studies about trihalometallates with the GUA+ cation. GUASnCl3 has a TF of 1.10, which seems to enable formation of a 3D perovskite network. Indeed, Szafranski et al. showed that the 3D orthorhombic structure present at room temperature, becomes more symmetric with an increase in temperature.80 From our results GUAGeI3 with a TF of 1.19 is not likely to form 3D structures, which agrees with the results of Stoumpos et al., who found a lower dimensional (1D) hexagonal structure being preferred under ambient conditions.67
The isocharge dependent radius of the AZ+ cation is merely 2.5% larger compared to that of FA+, while exhibiting only one NH2 group. The reduced probability of H-bonding could lead to a smaller effective ionic radius due to enhanced molecular disorder, theoretically allowing the existence of several 3D AZBX3 phases under ambient conditions. With Sn2+ and Sr2+, the TFs are 1.11 and 1.10 as chlorides and 1.09 as bromides, respectively. With Pb2+, Sr2+ and Sm2+ as iodides, the TFs are 1.10, 1.05 and 1.08, respectively. Furthermore, the highly symmetric and circular structure of the molecular cation, which contains three CH2 groups, may also improve the rotational freedom around the center of mass. Therefore, although AZSnI3 and AZDyI3 have TFs being slightly too large (1.124 respectively), these compounds are predicted to form 3D phases at elevated temperatures. AZ+ is well known in the field of metal–organic formate frameworks,81 but there are no reports about the combination to hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites.
Special attention should be given to the alkyl-series DiMA+, TriMA+ and TetraMA+. DiMA+ is showing appropriate TFs with Sn2+ and Sr2+ as bromides (1.12 respectively) and with Sr2+ and Sm2+ as iodides (1.08 and 1.10 respectively). TetraMA+ has TFs of 1.09 and 1.11 with Sr2+ and Sm2+ as iodides, respectively. TriMA+ has TFs of 1.10 and 1.12 also with Sr2+ and Sm2+ as iodides. Although indicating a critical overall steric size, the impact of the single amino-group on the outmost electron density is gradually decreasing with the number of methyl groups. Likely, this will lead to a dramatic decrease in the probability of H-bonding to the halide network, thereby reducing the effective ionic radii with regard to the cuboctahedral environment. For DiMA+, the electron density of the amino-group is already located approximately 1.0 Å apart from the outer boundary of the isocharge density of the cation, resulting in a decrease of strength of the N–H⋯X-bond. For TriMA+, the NH-group resides approximately 1.2 Å apart from the boundary and TetraMA+ has its nitrogen atom located in the center of mass and is, as a consequence, not providing any significant H-bonding (only the weaker C–H⋯X-bonding). Thus, a fictional perovskite (MexNH4−x)BX3 with increasing x and satisfying the TF–μ stability criteria might be stable as a 3D structure. DiMA+ is known to adopt a perovskite-like structure in MOFs82 but is rarely investigated in combination with trihalometallates. Very recently, a publication appeared investigating the crystal structures of MA+, DiMA+ and TriMA+ in combination with Pb and three halides (Cl−, Br− and I−).83 DiMAPbI3 (TF = 1.13) consists of infinite chains of face-sharing octahedra forming a hexagonal phase. The larger TriMA+ (TF = 1.15) was found to exist in the same structural type, but with a stronger modulation due to the larger size misfit between the organic cation and the PbI3− chains, although no single crystal was available for structure analysis. The analogous compounds in combination with PbBr3− (TFs of 1.18 and 1.20 for DiMA+ and TriMA+ respectively) are similar in structure and also form a hexagonal perovskite with face-sharing octahedra, which in turn share free corners to build a 3D network.84 It has to be noted that all of these structures were obtained at room temperature. Furthermore, DiMASnI3 was investigated and found to adopt the 2D CsNiCl3 structure with face-sharing SnI6 octahedra connected to 1D chains,85 being consistent with our calculated TF of 1.15, which is too large for 3D perovskite formation. The germanium containing TriMAGeI3 was recently characterized by Stoumpos et al.; the compound similarly consists of a 1D hexagonal perovskite structure with face-sharing GeI6 octahedra.67 Our calculated TF (1.25) confirmed the prevention of the formation of a 3D network. TetraMAGeCl3 was also reported and shown to have a cubic phase above 428 K, while it is only perovskite-like in terms of Ge2+ coordination, but the cubic symmetry actually results from the dynamic disorder of GeCl3−-units.86 The latter result agrees with our calculated large TF of 1.33, indicating a strong breakdown of the 3D perovskite symmetry. TriMASnBr3 does not fit the stability criteria (TF = 1.14) and was found to adopt a distorted orthorhombic perovskite structure with isolated pyramidal GeBr3−-units analogous to RbGeBr3.87 Furthermore, RbGeBr3 itself reveals a phase change at 230 °C indicating a cubic structure, but it is stated that Ge2+ maintains its pyramidal environment and the higher symmetry is only faked due to dislocation of the metal ions.88
In the case of EA+ or isoPA+ (one amino-group respectively) and AA+ or IM+ (two amino-groups respectively), the N–H groups are located near the outer isocharge boundary, indicating strong H-bonding probability. EA+, AA+ and IM+ have suitable TFs only with Sr2+ and Sm2+ as iodides (1.09 and 1.11 for EA+ and AA+, 1.09 and 1.12 for IM+, respectively). isoPA+ shows only one potential candidate with SrI3− (TF = 1.10). All other combinations with these cations aren't suitable to allow the formation of 3D perovskite phases. Actually, it was confirmed that the EA+ cation in EAPbI3 (TF = 1.14) led to a breakdown of the 3D symmetry, forming a layered 2D perovskite where infinite chains of face-sharing PbI6 octahedra are separated by EA+ ions.89 EASnI3 also does not form a 3D phase in accordance with its large TF of 1.16.50 EAPbBr3 does not fit the stability criteria (TF = 1.19), but Mittal et al. found experimentally (via XRD) and theoretically a stable 3D nanoparticle and concluded that there should not be a reduction of the crystal sheet thickness with EA+ incorporation into MAPbBr3.90 However, the reported strong shift for the prominent (001)-reflex to lower 2θ-values (Δ > 4°) indicates a massive distortion of the perovskite network if not a reduced dimensionality. AAGeI3 and isoPAGeI3 were recently investigated.67 AAGeI3 (TF = 1.24) was found to crystallize in a quasi-3D pseudo-hexagonal monoclinic space group with face-sharing Ge3I93− building blocks, while isoPAGeI3 (TF = 1.25) exhibits collinearly stacked GeI3− units in a hexagonal phase forming a cation-separated 1D perovskite structure. Both structures are in agreement with our calculated stability criteria, indicating the rearrangement to lower dimensional phases. Imidazolium has not been reported in the field of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite compounds yet.
PY+, isoBuA+, DiEA+ and PhA+ cations are obviously too large to fit into the cuboctahedral cavity (TFs > 1.13 for all combinations already with SrI3−), while the PY+, isoBuA+ and PhA+ cations additionally exhibit amino-groups near the outer boundary of the isocharge. These molecular cations are likely to inhibit the formation of a three dimensional perovskite structure, giving rise to lower dimensional crystal networks.
Based on the stability considerations presented above (0.9 < TF < 1.12 and μ > 0.414), we can predict the possible formation of 106 hitherto unknown 3D perovskite-like compounds (Table S5, ESI†). AZSnI3 and AZDyI3 are exceptions with TFs of 1.124 respectively, but in these cases the highly symmetric CH2-backbone and the presence of only one NH2-group could possibly allow the formation of a 3D structure with anionic BI3− networks. The most encouraging findings for new 3D perovskites that could be stable are built by the family of lead halide compounds. HYPbCl3, HAPbCl3, HAPbBr3 and AZPbI3 were found to fulfill the stability criteria. The PbX3− network is well characterized in hybrid structures and it was found that the energy levels near the Egap are only made up of Pb and X orbitals, whereas the organic component had little influence on the relevant DOS.6,91 Therefore, since the band structure (which in turn determines the photovoltaic properties) is expected to be influenced by the cation size-dependent structural change only, this group of compounds could provide a further contingence for tuning the optoelectronic properties of absorber materials over a wide range.
It should be noted that the TF-concept, although useful for perovskite compounds with atomistic constituents, is applicable for hybrid organic–inorganic combinations only with limitations. The non-spherical shape of many organic cations makes it hard to define an effective ionic radius, while H-bonding to the inorganic network differs substantially from molecule to molecule.30 The latter fact still raises the question, whether a generalized model is suitable to predict the formation of a constitutional combination for the whole class of materials. In particular the stereoactivity of the s2 (B2+) lone-pair of Ge2+ impedes a generalized evaluation about its combination with inorganic halide networks.67,72 For some examples the empirical relationships 0.9 < TF < 1.12 and μ > 0.414 seem not to work as sufficient stability criteria for the formation of 3D perovskite phases. MAGeBr3 (TF = 1.14, μ = 0.372) and MAGeI3 (TF = 1.09, μ = 0.35) were found to exist as high dimensional networks, although the TF of MAGeBr3 is too large and both μs are too small. This should be attributed to the exceptional steric size demand for the Ge2+ lone pair. MAGeBr3 showed a phase transition to a symmetric cubic 3D network at approximately 400 K (ref. 65) and MAGeI3 has a trigonal distorted 3D structure at room temperature.67 FAPbBr3 (TF = 1.14) was predicted not to exist as a high dimensional perovskite, but is present as a 3D phase with a tetragonal distortion.71,72 From XRD measurements, FAPbCl3 was carefully regarded to have the cubic perovskite structure, but has a TF of 1.150, being too large to allow 3D phase formation.74,75 Here, the lack of more extensive structural characterization and the large Egap (>3.0 eV) makes the suggested dimensionality uncertain. EAPbBr3 (TF = 1.19) is thought to have a 3D structure similar to that of MAPbBr3 at room temperature, despite having a TF which is too large.90 The lack of single crystal analysis makes this case also slightly divisive. Though, for the two compounds FAPbCl3 and EAPbBr3 the dimensionality of the inorganic network is not fully cleared in the literature, we address them to be incorrectly predicted by our TF–μ plot.
However, since the majority of the investigated compounds agree very well with our calculated trends of steric size and high dimensional network formation (88% conformance in general, ∼93% conformance when the two Ge2+-containing outliers are neglected), TFs and μs allow for a rough guess about the stability of 3D perovskite structures. Specifically, since the very few aforementioned incorrectly predicted compounds were investigated at room temperature and were structurally only roughly characterized, they might exist in more symmetric high temperature phases. There are a lot of indications that lower dimensional or highly distorted perovskite phases become more symmetrical (often 3-dimensional cubic) at higher temperatures, due to the thermal movement of the organic cation and the resulting averaging of the structural distortion over the inorganic network.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we estimated the possibility of the formation of 3D perovskite structures by calculating TFs and μs for 486 permutations of ABX3 organic–inorganic hybrid compounds. 18 organic monoammonium cations were investigated in combination with 9 divalent metal ions and three halides. In order to estimate the steric size of the molecular cations, we considered the total electron density of their energy-minimized states in the gas-phase and quantified an effective ionic radius with regard to simple NH4+ as the reference. 106 hitherto unknown hypothetical compounds can be claimed to build-up stable 3D perovskite phases under ambient conditions. The applicability of our method was successfully verified by comparing with reported hybrid ABX3 compounds with a rate of 88% (93% disregarding Ge2+ outliers), although one should critically assess this statistic due to the rather small number of available structural investigations. When high temperature phases are concerned, the number supposedly increases, since the higher thermal energy leads to a faster rotational and vibrational disorder of the molecular cation. These movements finally result in an average inorganic network distortion with apparently higher symmetry. Our methodology is generally applicable for a wide range of potential hybrid perovskite compounds throughout the periodic table, where the B2+ site might be substituted by alkaline earth or transition metals and the X− anion can be a chalcogenide or a small molecular anion like CN−, HCOO−, BH4− or N3−. In particular the latter constituents will result in smaller TFs due to their larger sizes compared to elemental anions and potentially lead to a huge number of stable combinations with organic cations in the A-position. In each combination the charge-neutrality has to be preserved. The TF–μ approach is generally suitable to be used as a preliminary screening for more intense theoretical and experimental investigations of individual compounds. We expect that this study will motivate further research activities in designing perovskite structures with defined optoelectronic properties, and that the great constitutional flexibility of perovskites along with their promising physical properties will render them a prominent chemical structure in ferroelectrics and the next generation photovoltaics.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Ideal cubic perovskite crystal structure. The large cation (green) in the cuboctahedral A-position is Cs+ or a small molecular organic cation, the smaller B2+ metal cation (white) is typically Pb2+ or Sn2+ and coordinated by six anions (red, usually Cl−, Br− or I−) forming an octahedral geometry.

 	Fig. 2  Molecular gas-phase structures of 18 monoammonium cations considered for calculating effective steric sizes and tolerance factors. Carbon atoms are indicated in grey, nitrogen in blue, oxygen in red and hydrogen in white.	 

 	Fig. 3  2D mapping of calculated tolerance factors and octahedral factors for 486 hybrid ABX3 compounds. 18 organic cations are combined with 9 divalent metals and three halides. The empirical stability range for 3D perovskite formation (1.12 < TF > 0.9 and μ > 0.414) is framed with a dashed rectangle. Molecular cations larger than isopropylammonium (isoPA+) reveal tolerance factors being too large to allow formation of 3D ABX3 networks. Published experimental or theoretical structurally characterized compounds are marked as crosses. Green crosses indicate reported 3D perovskites, red crosses denote lower dimensional phases. Blue crosses show Ge-containing compounds existing as 3D structures. Unreported compounds are presented as diamonds. The diagram considers geometrical parameters only, effects of N–H or C–H bonding on the effective steric demands for molecular cations are not incorporated.
