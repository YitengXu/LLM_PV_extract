, Accepted 26th October 2016First published on 9th November 2016AbstractCocatalysts have been extensively used to accelerate the rate of hydrogen evolution in semiconductor-based photocatalytic systems; however, the influence of interface states between the semiconductor and cocatalyst has rarely been investigated. Herein, we demonstrated a feasible strategy of heterogeneous structure to enhance visible light hydrogen generation of the MoS2/B-TiO2 system. Loading of MoS2 nanosheets on the surface of anatase boron doped TiO2 (B-TiO2) nanosheets with exposed {001} facets considerably increases the interfacial contact. At an optimal ratio of 1.0 wt% MoS2, the MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalyst showed the highest H2 evolution rate of 0.50 mmol h−1 g−1, which is almost 6 times higher than that of pure B-TiO2 nanosheets. More importantly, the MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalyst exhibited photocatalytic activity much higher than that of Pt/B-TiO2 nanosheets and the simple mechanical mixing of B-TiO2 and MoS2 nanosheets photocatalysts. The decisive factor in improving the photocatalytic H2 production activity is an intimate and large contact interface between the light-harvesting semiconductor and cocatalyst. The effective charge transfers from B-TiO2 to MoS2 was demonstrated by the significant enhancement of the photocurrent responses in MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid electrodes. This study created new opportunities for designing and constructing highly efficient visible light photocatalysts by surface modification or doping.
Introduction
Due to the global energy crisis and demand for environmental protection, the development of direct conversion of solar energy to hydrogen fuel from water via artificial photosynthesis has attracted considerable attention recently.1,2 In such a photocatalytic scheme, the reductive side of water splitting is the light-induced generation of hydrogen from aqueous protons. Catalytic systems that have been successfully constructed for photoinduced hydrogen evolution typically use a semiconductor material as a photocatalyst to harvest solar light in conjunction with a noble metal cocatalyst.3–5 Noble metals were initially used as photocatalyst and cocatalyst for TiO2 and had a positive effect on the H2 evolution from water splitting.6–8 However, the use of noble metals for H2 evolution from water may be difficult in practical applications due to their high-cost and scarcity; thus, low-cost inorganic materials have become potential and suitable candidates. Among the inorganic materials, MoS2 as a cocatalyst of the photocatalyst was found to be a good candidate to meet the demands of practical applications.9–14 MoS2 loading on TiO2 as a cocatalyst exhibited excellent and higher photocatalytic H2 evolution performance than the noble metals Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru and Au.15
Recently, an anatase TiO2 nanosheet with exposed {001} facet was considered to be the most promising candidate for solar-to-H2 conversion because it was highly efficient, inexpensive, earth abundant, stable, and nontoxic.16,17 However, TiO2 can solely absorb UV light, which accounts for only 4% of total sunlight, thus greatly limiting its practical applications. Hence, it is highly desirable to develop photocatalysts with high catalytic activities under visible light irradiation. To achieve this goal, numerous strategies, including impurity doping18,19 and growth of TiO2-based heterostructures,20,21 have been developed that were aimed at enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2-based photocatalysts by broadening their light harvesting window to the visible light range. In addition, semiconductor heterostructures, such as g-C3N4/TiO2,22 reduced graphene oxide/TiO2,23 Ti3C2/TiO2 (ref. 24) and graphene quantum dots/TiO2,25 with exposed {001} facets have also been reported, since efficient charge separation can be obtained by coupling two semiconductor structures with matched energy levels, leading to improved photocatalytic activity and efficiency. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior work regarding the application of layered MoS2-loaded anatase boron doped TiO2 (B-TiO2) nanosheets with exposed {001} facet hybrid photocatalyst for visible light hydrogen generation has been reported to date. More importantly, coupling different materials of anatase B-TiO2 nanosheets and layered MoS2 would greatly enhance the photocatalytic activity of this photocatalyst due to the increased contact interface and charge transfer rate, boron doped titanium dioxide promoting visible light absorption, and the effective exposure of highly reactive {001} facets of B-TiO2.26,27 Accordingly, it is expected that the combination of {001} facet exposed anatase TiO2 nanosheets and layered MoS2 would be promising to obtain a highly efficient, low-cost, and stable photocatalyst for solar-to-H2 conversion.
In this study, we designed and synthesized a functional MoS2/B-TiO2 composite photocatalyst using anatase boron doped TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets as the light-harvesting semiconductor and layered MoS2 as the cocatalyst for solar H2 generation. Such a novel architecture provides an intimate and large contact interface for fast interfacial charge separation. As a result, the nanojunction photocatalyst was anticipated to exhibit superior photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution.
Experimental
Materials
Thiourea (NH2CSNH2) and sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Titanium boride (TiB2, 98%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar China (Tianjin) Co., Ltd, and sodium fluoroborate (NaBF4, 99%) was purchased from Macklin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36.5%) was purchased from Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All reagents were used as received without further purification.
Materials synthesis
The anatase B-TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets were prepared in a NaBF4 aqueous solution using TiB2 as the precursor according to our previously reported method.22 In a typical synthesis, 500 mg TiB2 was added to 30 ml of 2 M NaBF4 and hydrochloric acid aqueous solution. The mixture was stirred for 30 min and then transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and placed into a preheated oven to perform the hydrothermal decomposition treatment at 140 °C for 24 h. After hydrothermal processing, a gray fluffy power was collected and washed with copious amounts of distilled water and absolute alcohol three times and then dried in air at 80 °C for over night. The powders were further heat treated in a tube furnace at 450 °C for 3 h in air. The as-obtained sample was boron doped TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets.
The MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts were prepared by hydrothermal reactions of the B-TiO2 nanosheet powders obtained above in an aqueous solution with sodium molybdate dehydrate and thiourea. The nominal weight ratios of MoS2 to B-TiO2 were 0.50, 1.00, and 2.00 wt%, and the obtained samples were labeled as 0.50, 1.00, and 2.00 wt% MoS2/B-TiO2 photocatalysts, respectively. In a typical synthesis, 500 mg of the B-TiO2 nanosheet prepared above was dispersed in 35 ml of aqueous solution consisting of a moderate amount of sodium molybdate dihydrate and thiourea to form a transparent solution. The mixed solution was then transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and then heated to 200 °C for 24 h in an electric oven. The gray products were collected via centrifugation and washed thoroughly with ethanol before drying at 60 °C for 24 h.
For comparison, the physically mixed sample (B-TiO2 + MoS2), 495 mg of B-TiO2 nanosheets and 5 mg of MoS2 nanosheets were milled for 1 h.
The preparation method for 1.00 wt% Pt/B-TiO2 was as follows: the suspension was obtained by ultrasonication of 20 ml of H2PtCl6 (0.26 mM) and 100 mg of the as-prepared samples for 30 min. Then, 10 ml of a solution containing 30 mg of NaBH4 was added drop wise to the suspension, which was stirred at room temperature for 5 h. The suspension was then filtered to recover the solid product and washed copiously with water. The recovered solid was then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h.
Photoelectrode preparation. The MoS2/B-TiO2 photoelectrodes were prepared using an electrophoretic deposition method. Typically, 10 mg of iodine and 20 mg of MoS2/B-TiO2 powder were dispersed in 25 ml of acetone. The electrophoretic deposition process was conducted between two parallel ITO electrodes with a 1 cm distance under 15 V of bias for 5 min. Finally, the electrodes were heated to 300 °C for 30 min under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Materials characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared samples were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (D/max-IIIA, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation. The surface morphology of the as-prepared samples was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (LEO1530VP, LEO Company). The UV-Vis light absorption spectra of the as-prepared samples were obtained using a Hitachi UV-3010 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere assembly using the diffuse reflection method and BaSO4 as a reference to measure all the samples. All the elements in the MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalyst was studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a Krato Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer. The binding energy was referenced to C 1s line at 284.6 eV for calibration. The BET surface area was determined using adsorption data in the 0.05–0.3 (P/P0) relative pressure range.
Photoelectrochemical measurement
Photocurrent measurements were carried out in a standard photoelectrochemical cell by an electrochemical workstation (CV-27, BAS). The as-prepared samples, platinum gauze and Ag/AgCl were used as working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A sodium sulfate solution (0.5 M) was used as the electrolyte. The light for the photocurrent was filtered (>400 nm, 150 mW cm−2) using a PLS-SXE 300UV Xe lamp.
Evaluation of photocatalytic activity
The photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments were performed in a 100 ml Pyrex flask at ambient temperature, and the reactor (Fig. S1 in ESI†) was connected to a closed-cycle circulation system. A PLS-SXE 300UV Xe arc lamp (Changtuo, Beijing, Fig. S2 in ESI†) with a UV cutoff filter (λ > 400 nm, 150 mW cm−2) was used as the light source. In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 100 mg photocatalyst was immersed in 80 ml mixed solution of methanol and water (the volume ratio was 1:3). Furthermore, the suspensions were stirred, followed by illumination for 20 min at room temperature. Prior to irradiation, they were bubbled with nitrogen through the reactor for 40 min to completely remove dissolved oxygen and ensure the reactor was in an anaerobic condition. 0.4 ml sample was intermittently taken through the septum, and hydrogen was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-14C, Shimadzu, Japan, TCD).
Results and discussion
The morphology of pure B-TiO2 nanosheets and MoS2/B-TiO2 composite photocatalysts was investigated by SEM. As shown in Fig. 1a, the SEM image of as-prepared {001} facet exposed B-TiO2 nanosheets shows that the product consisted of well-defined sheet-shaped structures with a 35.6 m2 g−1 specific surface area. The average size of B-TiO2 nanosheets from the SEM image shown in Fig. 1a was calculated to be 1 μm in the side length and the side width and 0.4 μm in thickness. From the size and geometry, the percentage of exposed highly reactive {001} facets in the nanocomposite was calculated by the method described by Yang et al.28 The percentages of {001} facets were estimated to be 50%. After composited with MoS2, some small sheet structure appeared on the surface of B-TiO2 nanosheets (Fig. 1b). The compositions and elements of the MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalyst were further investigated with EDS (Fig. S3 in ESI†). Ti, O, Mo, and S were detected in the composites. The presence of Ti and O atoms corroborate the development of TiO2. The presence of Mo and S peaks could be related to MoS2. Results of EDS and SEM suggested that the as-prepared samples were MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts.

The XRD patterns of pure B-TiO2 nanosheets and MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts are shown in Fig. S4.† For the pure B-TiO2 sample, all the diffraction peaks are indexed to the anatase phase (JCPDS card no. 21-1272).19 The diffraction peaks appearing at 2θ = 25.44°, 38.20°, 48.29°, 54.22°, 55.30°, 62.82°, 70.48°, 75.58°, and 76.52° can be attributed to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (220), (215), and (301) lattice planes of the anatase TiO2, respectively.15 After loading of MoS2 on the surface of B-TiO2 nanosheets, no characteristic diffraction peak of MoS2 was observed in the XRD patterns of as-prepared MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts, probably due to the small amount of MoS2 component and its high dispersion on the surface of TiO2 nanosheets. However, the MoS2 component in the MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts could be further confirmed by XPS analyses.
As shown in Fig. S5a,† a wide-scan XPS spectrum of 1.0 wt% MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts shows the binding energy peaks at 163, 192, 232, 464, and 530 eV, which can be attributed to the S 2p, B 1s, Mo 3d, Ti 2p, and O 1s peaks, respectively.29,30 As illustrated in Fig. S5b,† the binding energy of the B 1s core electrons was 192 eV, which belongs to the typical surface Ti–O–B linkages.31,32 Fig. S5c† shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Mo 3d, which contains Mo 3d3/2 at 232 eV and Mo 3d5/2 at 229 eV. In addition, the doublet peaks for S 2p at 161.6 eV (S 2p3/2) and 162.8 eV (S 2p1/2) (Fig. S5d in ESI†) indicate formation of MoS2 in the MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalyst. The O 1s core level peaks at 530.0 eV originates from the Ti–O–Ti linkages in TiO2 (Fig. S5e in ESI†), which is consistent with that of other reports.33,34 Another core level peak of O 1s was at around 531.2 eV, which is attributed to the presence of Ti–O–B linkages. The pair of peaks for Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 appeared at 458.7 and 464.4 eV, respectively, which can be assigned to Ti4+ 2p peaks of TiO2 (Fig. S5f in ESI†). The XPS measurements confirmed that the layered MoS2 was successfully loaded onto the B-TiO2 surface.
There is a great need for structuring a photocatalyst to optimize the absorption properties related to bandgap, size, and/or band position.35 The UV-Vis absorption spectrum can be used to evaluate semiconductor bandgaps. As shown in Fig. 2, the pure B-TiO2 nanosheets exhibited a fundamental absorption band in sunlight with a wavelength less than 430 nm, whereas MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts showed significantly increased absorption in the visible light range. The bandgaps of the photocatalysts can be calculated using the following equation: 
(1)where a is the absorption coefficient, A is a constant, h is Planck's constant, Eg is the band energy, ν is the frequency of the incident light, and n is equal to 1 for the direct transition. The corresponding Kubelka–Munk transformed reflectance spectra are shown in Fig. 2b wherein the slopes of the tangents on horizontal axis are bandgap energies. The calculated bandgap energy for B-TiO2 nanosheets was 2.86 eV, whereas the narrower bandgap energy of approximately 2.55 eV for the 1.0 wt% MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts is very suitable for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity at a reasonable rate.36,37

The band gap energy of the as-prepared samples can be calculated from the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra, according to eqn (1): (a) pure B-TiO2; (b) 0.5 wt% MoS2/B-TiO2; (c) 1.0 wt% MoS2/B-TiO2; (d) 2.0 wt% MoS2/B-TiO2. 
Previous studies have suggested that the interface between the light-harvesting semiconductor and cocatalyst is one of the key factors that can determine the over separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers.38,39 In the present study, the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were used to investigate the efficiency of the interfacial electron transfer from TiO2 to MoS2, since the PL emission results from the recombination of free charge carriers.40 Fig. S6† presents the comparison of PL emission spectra of pure B-TiO2 and MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts in ethanol solutions (0.1 mg ml−1) excited at 330 nm. The PL emission intensity exhibited the highest value for the B-TiO2 and decreased monotonously with increasing MoS2 content. A strong emission peak at approximately 430 nm could be assigned to the band gap transition of B-TiO2, which is significantly different from the published values in the 385–395 nm region obtained from a bulk TiO2 sample.41 The blue shift of emission wavelength was caused by a reabsorption mechanism.42 That is, the emission peaks shifted to short wavelength with a decreasing TiO2 concentration. Remarkably, the emission peak could be effectively quenched in intensity in the presence of MoS2 due to the efficient interfacial electron transfer from excited TiO2 to MoS2. That is to say, the MoS2 cocatalyst loaded onto the TiO2 surface could act as an electron sink, which suppressed the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.
In order to further evaluate the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, migration, transfer, and separation, the photocurrent responses of both bare B-TiO2 electrode and MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid electrodes loaded with different amounts of MoS2 were tested. Fig. 3 shows the periodic on/off photocurrent response of all the samples upon irradiation with a 300 W Xe lamp. The bare B-TiO2 electrode generated a relatively low short-circuit photocurrent density with a 16 μA cm−2 value. After the MoS2 was loaded onto the B-TiO2 nanosheets surface, the photocurrent density of the MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid electrodes significantly increased. The 1.0 wt% MoS2/B-TiO2 electrode showed the highest 95 μA cm−2 photocurrent density, which was about six times higher than that of the bare B-TiO2 electrode. This conclusively demonstrated that the intimate nanojunction could significantly enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers in these MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts.

Fig. 4 presents a comparison of the photocatalytic H2 production activities of pure B-TiO2 nanosheets, MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt% MoS2), pure MoS2 nanosheets, 1.0 wt% Pt/B-TiO2 nanosheet, and the physical mixture of B-TiO2 nanosheets and MoS2 nanosheets (TiO2 + MoS2 with a weight ratio of 1.0 wt%) under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). The pure B-TiO2 nanosheets showed a poor photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, whereas the MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts exhibited much higher photocatalytic hydrogen production activities. It is clear that the content of MoS2 nanosheets had a significant influence on the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts. The optimal loading of MoS2 in MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts was 1.0 wt%, with hydrogen production rates as high as 0.50 mmol h−1 g−1 under visible light illumination. In contrast, lower loading of MoS2 (0.5 wt%) led to insufficient visible light absorption and less active sites, whereas excessive loading of MoS2 (2.0 wt%) may block the photogenerated electrons transfer and reduce active site exposure due to a high degree of overlap with each other. The pure MoS2 nanosheets exhibited a lower hydrogen production rate than that of MoS2/B-TiO2, indicating the beneficial synergetic effect from the MoS2/B-TiO2 heterostructure.43 In addition, the simple mechanical mixing of TiO2 nanosheets and MoS2 nanosheets showed lower hydrogen production rates due to the poor interfacial contacts between MoS2 nanosheets and B-TiO2 nanosheets, which extremely inhibited electron transfer. For comparison, 1.0 wt% of Pt loaded on the surface of B-TiO2 nanosheets photocatalyst showed a 0.33 mmol h−1 g−1 H2 evolution rate, and the physical mixture of B-TiO2 nanosheets and MoS2 nanosheets was only 0.16 mmol h−1 g−1, whereas the rates were lower than that of the 1.0 wt% MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts.

(B) Cyclic H2-evolution curves for 1.0 wt% MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts under visible light irradiation (150 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G). 
The recoverability is an important consideration for its practical application of a photocatalyst. The photocatalytic activity stability of 1.0 wt% MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalyst was evaluated by recycling the photocatalyst towards the hydrogen evolution reaction. After five reuses lasting 25 h each, the H2 production rates remained highly stable under visible light irradiation (Fig. 4B). Thus, it can be seen that the MoS2/B-TiO2 heterostructure is a high-performance photocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen production.
On the basis of the above results, a proposed mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic H2 production activities of MoS2/B-TiO2 photocatalysts is illustrated in Fig. 5. The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge potentials of TiO2 were at −0.46 and 2.70 eV, respectively.44 After boron doping TiO2, B 2p gives rise to localized states in the band-gap of the oxide, the VB edge potentials of B-TiO2 nanosheets is at ca. 2.40 eV (Fig. 2b). However, the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge potentials of MoS2 were at −0.12 and 1.78 eV, respectively.14 Under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm), the electrons in the valence band (VB) of B-TiO2 are excited to the conduction band to create electron–hole pairs. Due to the comparable energy difference between the CB of B-TiO2 and MoS2, there is a strong thermodynamic driving force for electron transfer from excited B-TiO2 to MoS2. More importantly, the intimate and large contact interface between TiO2 and MoS2 is the key factor in determining the superior H2 evolution activities of MoS2/B-TiO2 photocatalysts, which favors charge transfer from B-TiO2 to MoS2 for H2 evolution, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activities for hydrogen evolution. The effective charge transfer from excited B-TiO2 to MoS2 was demonstrated by the significant enhancement of photocurrent responses in MoS2/B-TiO2 composite electrodes (Fig. 5). Finally, the electron on the surface of MoS2 can react with the absorbed protons to evolve H2 efficiently, whereas the holes in the VB of B-TiO2 are consumed by a methanol sacrificial reagent. Therefore, herein, a rapid photogenerated charge separation and relatively slow charge recombination is achieved, which significantly enhances the photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared photocatalysts.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we fabricated a noble metal free MoS2 modified B-TiO2 photocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 production. The MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalyst showed high photocatalytic activity with a maximum H2 evolution rate of 0.50 mmol h−1 g−1 for the sample containing 1.0 wt% MoS2, which was about six times higher than that of pure B-TiO2 nanosheets. It is believed that the intimate and large contact interface between MoS2 and B-TiO2 can efficiently promote the photoinduced charge carrier separation, which plays a key factor in determining the high photocatalytic performance of MoS2/B-TiO2 hybrid photocatalyst. The present study demonstrates the importance of the heterogeneous structure between a light-harvesting semiconductor and a cocatalyst in improving the photocatalytic H2 production efficiency, and the interface engineering is expected to be an excellent strategy for constructing highly efficient solar hydrogen generation systems.
