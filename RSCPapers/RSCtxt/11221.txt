, Accepted 5th April 2023First published on 5th April 2023AbstractLithium is a fundamental raw material for the production of rechargeable batteries. The technology currently in use for lithium salts recovery from continental brines entails the evaporation of huge water volumes in desert environments. It also requires that the native brines reside for not less than a year in open air ponds, and is only applicable to selected compositions, not allowing its application to more diluted brines such as those geothermally sourced or waters produced from the oil industry. We have proposed an alternative technology based on membrane electrolysis. In three consecutive water electrolyzers, fitted alternately with anion and cation permselective membranes, we have shown, at proof-of-concept level, that it is possible to sequentially recover lithium carbonate and several by-products, including magnesium and calcium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, H2 and HCl. The big challenge is to bring this technology closer to practical implementation. Thus, the issue is how to apply relatively well-known electrochemical technology principles to large volumes and to a highly complex and saline broth. We have studied the application of this new methodology to ternary mixtures (NaCl, LiCl and KCl) with constant LiCl and KCl composition and increasing NaCl content. Results showed very similar behaviour for systems containing [Na+]/[Li+] concentration ratios ranging from 1.24 to 4.80. The voltage developed between the anode and cathode is almost the same in all systems at roughly 3.5 V when a constant current density of 50 A m−2 is applied. The three monovalent cations migrate with different rates across the cation exchange membrane, with Li+ being the most sluggish and thus crystallization of Li2CO3 only occurs close to completion of the electrolysis. The dimensionless concentration profiles are almost indistinguishable despite the changes in total salinity. The solids crystallized from different feeds showed higher Na+ and K+ contents as the initial Na+ concentration was increased. However, solids with over 99.9% purity in Li2CO3 could be obtained after a simple re-suspension treatment in hot water. The electrochemical energy consumption greatly increases with higher Na+ concentrations, and the amount of fresh water that can be recovered is diminished.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, the concept of electrosynthesis is most often associated with the synthesis of organic molecules, particularly amongst academics.1,2 However, at large industrial scales, electrochemical processes have been in use for several decades for the preparation of several inorganic compounds, such as bromine, fluorine, chlorate, perchlorate and persulfate, amongst others, with the chlor-alkali process leading the way.3,4 The need to develop more sustainable hydrometallurgical processes, together with astounding price increases for certain raw materials5 pave the road for revisiting electrochemical technologies as an alternative for the production of inorganic compounds. Lithium and magnesium, classified by both the European Union and the USA as critical,6 are examples of raw materials for which electrosynthetic strategies are worth exploring.
The evaporitic technology currently in place for the production of lithium carbonate from aqueous sources has been largely criticized both because of its poor sustainability and its techno-economic limitations.5,7,8 The evaporitic technology fully relies on open air water evaporation to concentrate lithium rich brines. Over 90% of the original water content of said brines is lost through evaporation, a practice that is very controversial since it takes place in highly arid locations.9,10 In addition, open air water evaporation is sluggish, taking between 10–24 months to reach a suitable concentration for processing, slowing down the start up of mining projects, and limiting the possibilities of adjusting production to market demands.5
On a second note, the evaporitic technology requires large amounts of chemicals for the processing of the concentrated brines. While these are not rare or particularly costly, the continuous shipping of large volumes of chemicals to very remote locations through winding roads brings along an extra logistical problem. Finally, open air evaporation is only efficient in desert locations, with very low annual rainfall, inexpensive flat land, and assuming a minimum Li+ concentration in the aqueous source.11,12 These requirements severely limit the application of the technology to relatively few deposits worldwide. Lithium rich geothermal and oilfield brines, which are available in many more countries worldwide, cannot be exploited through current technology.5
There is an open quest for the development of disruptive brine processing technologies that fully avoid evaporation, jointly named Direct Lithium Extraction technologies, DLE.5,13–17 Several clever proposals based on electrochemical techniques have been put forward. These can be broadly divided into two large categories. A first group employs lithium insertion electrodes, with similar chemistries to those employed in lithium ion-batteries.18,19 In a first step, Li+ cations present in a highly complex brine are electrochemically inserted in materials such as lithium manganese oxide,20,21 titanium oxide22 and lithium iron phosphate,23 amongst other examples. Subsequently, Li+ is liberated in a pure LiCl solution when, alternately, the potential or the current is inverted. A second large group of technologies employs permselective membranes to move cations and anions in opposite directions.17,24,25 Excellent results have been reported for the efficient separation of Li+ and divalent cations, most importantly Mg2+.26,27 Unfortunately, the development of Li+ selective membranes is sluggish, with reported examples only producing a limited selectively and no results reported for large Na+/Li+ concentration ratios. Thus, most electrodialysis setups today are only able to concentrate a mixture of the monovalent species, K+, Na+ and Li+,28,29 which is not suitable for the direct crystallization of pure lithium products.
In parallel, CO2 capture in amine scrubbing systems is amongst the most efficient CO2 capture systems. However, amine scrubbing requires the subsequent release and compression of CO2.30,31 Another proposal for CO2 capture is its conversion to carbonate minerals, an approach that has the important added advantage of simultaneously storing CO2.32 High salinity aqueous sources, and especially those rich in multivalent cations, are abundant. However, CO2 fixation rate and storage capacity can be largely increased if, in addition to a large source of cations, the aqueous source can also provide a large supply of hydroxyl anions to rapidly convert CO2 to carbonate or bicarbonate anions. Hydroxyl anions can be easily produced via water reduction, and, with the acceleration in the quest for developing CO2 capture and storage alternatives, several proposals have been put forward.31,33–40 Sorimachi proposed the use of a NaOH and CaCl2 solution, and the subsequent electrochemical regeneration of NaOH.41 Llanos et al. achieved a 93% current efficiency for CO2 fixation with simultaneous hypochlorite production.42 Mustafa et al. recently reviewed the nascent field of concentrated brine management and CO2 capture.43
We recently proposed to take advantage of the hydroxyl anions produced at the cathode of a water electrolyser to adsorb CO2 as either bicarbonate or carbonate anions and crystallize NaHCO3 and Li2CO3, see Fig. 1.44,45 This novel approach simultaneously allows for chemical fixation and storage of CO2 and for the production of Li2CO3 without the constant freighting of Na2CO3 as in the current evaporitic approach. Li+ cations in natural sources are found in concentrations ranging from 10–150 ppm,46 in geothermal and oilfield sources, through 500–900 ppm, in continental brines, with a few examples, such as the Atacama salt flat, reaching 1500 ppm.12 Li2CO3 cannot be directly crystallized from natural sources, neither via addition of Na2CO3, nor via CO2 absorption. Because of the relatively high water solubility of Li2CO3, our membrane electrolysis method for Li2CO3 crystallization cannot be directly used on native brines, which require some sort of pre-treatment.
 Fig. 1  (Top): Schematic representation of the electrolysis process studied in this work. (Bottom) three different pre-processing strategies that could provide the top process with a processed brine of reduced [Na+]/[Li+] ratio. 
In the work reported here, we studied how the ratio of concentrations of Na+/Li+ affects the crystallization of Li2CO3 in a membrane electrolysis system coupled to a crystallizer. Our study shows that at higher Na+/Li+ ratios the purity of Li2CO3 decreases. However, a high purity product can be produced following re-suspension of the crystals in hot water. The system is largely affected by electroosmosis, and thus, while water of very low salinity can always be recovered from the middle compartment of the electrolyser, the proportion of freshwater recovered decreases when the Na+/Li+ increases. K+, Na+ and Li+ show differential mobility values across the cation exchange membrane, with Li+ always being more sluggish than the other monovalent cations. Therefore, an increased Na+/Li+ concentration ratio implies that, in a batch system, the largest share of Li+ cations are transferred to the cathodic compartment later during the electrolysis.
2. Experimental
2.1 Water electrolyzer
A three-compartment water electrolyzer was designed and made in-house. The design has previously been reported in ref. 44 and pictures are shown in Fig. S1.† The acrylic cell consisted of three identical compartments separated by an anion and a cation exchange membrane, with internal dimensions 5 × 20 × 2 cm, and internal volume equal to 200 cm3. The anode was a titanium mesh electrode coated with an iridium-based mixed metal oxide (IrO2/TiO2; 65/35%), with a perpendicular current collector (4.8 × 19.8 cm; 1 mm thickness, Magneto Special Anodes). The cathode was a stainless-steel wire mesh (4.8 × 19.8 cm) with a stainless-steel sheet metal current collector (distance between electrodes = 23 mm). Two plastic meshes were placed between the electrodes and the membranes to avoid direct contact, and to serve as turbulence promoters. The characteristics of the permselective membranes used to separate the three compartments are listed in Table 1.

All experiments were run in galvanostatic mode, in two electrode configurations (no reference electrodes were used), using a constant current/constant voltage power supply (simplest possible DC system, with potential for scaling up). The current density values are reported with respect to the geometrical area of the membranes (0.01 m2 each). Each experiment lasted 8–16 days. For the first ∼24 h, the applied current density was ∼10 A m−2, to stabilize the membranes. Next, for most of the duration of the experiment, the applied current density was (52 ± 6) A m−2. The applied current did not fluctuate more than 0.1 A m−2, but the applied current value varied slightly in the different experiments. When the DC power supply produced fluctuations, these were registered for the precise calculation of the total charge. When the ionic concentration in the middle compartment is severely decreased, the cell potential increases and eventually the voltage limit of the power supply is reached (30 V). As soon as this point was observed, the electrolysis was manually stopped (some experiments continued for about 2–4 hours in constant voltage mode at Esource = 30 V). The cell voltage was monitored directly from the digital screen in the power supply.
Experiments were run in batch recirculation mode at room temperature (20 ± 3) °C. The anodic compartment was connected to a 2000 cm3 plastic drum, the middle compartment was connected to a 5000 cm3 plastic drum, while the cathodic compartment was connected to a 1000 cm3 Schott-bottle, serving as a decanter. The total initial volumes for anolyte, middle and catholyte were 2000 cm3, 5000 cm3, and 500 cm3, respectively. These volumes were constantly recirculated through the cell compartments using a peristaltic pump (flow rate = 6 L h−1, PC28 APEMA). Recirculation also assured stirring of the solutions.
CO2 gas (technical quality) was bubbled in the Schott-bottle connected to the cathodic compartment. An electro valve and a pH-meter were connected to an Arduino UNO R3 card. The Arduino controlled the CO2 bubbling, i.e. opening or closing the electro valve to allow for CO2 bubbling only if pH > 11.
New membranes were immersed in NaCl 5% for 24 hours and then washed with de-ionized water, in order to hydrate and stabilize them. After each batch run, the reactor and the membranes were rinsed with de-ionized water. When not in use, the membranes were kept in artificial brine.
2.2 Test solutions
All solutions were prepared with de-ionized water. In these experiments, and for safety reasons, a buffer at pH 12 (1 M carbonate/bicarbonate, industrial grade) was used in the anodic compartment to disproportionate Cl2 into Cl− and ClO−. In the cathodic compartment, a 0.0135 M Li2CO3 (0.5%) solution was used (battery grade, Sales de Jujuy, Argentina). Four different solutions mimicking pre-treated brines were alternately added to the middle compartment. The compositions of these solutions are detailed in Table 3 (LiCl: Biopack; KCl and NaCl Cicarelli, all reagents of analytical grade). Different experiments were run by changing the Na+ concentration of the artificial brine, while keeping Li+ and K+ constant (with slight variations produced when weighing slightly different amounts).
2.3 Analytical measurements
0.5 cm3 samples were taken from both the middle and cathodic compartments at regular intervals to measure conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), and concentrations evolution with time. TDS were measured by evaporating the water content of 1.000 cm3 of the corresponding solution and weighing the remaining solids at a 0.1 mg precision. Conductivity measurements were carried out with a conductivity probe (HI763063 probe and HI99301 controller) on 1:100 dilutions of the original solutions. Li, K and Na compositions were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Shimadzu AA7000).
At the end of the batch runs the recovered crystals were vacuum filtered and washed with 5 mL de-ionized water at 45 °C (the solid remained in the filter during washing), dried at 100 °C over 24 h, and weighed. Cation compositions were determined after re-dissolution in 5% HNO3. Acid–base potentiometric titration was used to determine carbonate and bicarbonate concentrations in the solids re-dissolved in de-ionized water.
Next, the larger fraction of the original solids was re-suspended in the minimum amount of de-ionized water at 90 °C required to dissolve not more than 1% of Li2CO3, considering the purity values reported in Table 6. The re-suspended solids were sonicated for 15 minutes, and vacuum filtered. This purification procedure was repeated a total of 3 times. Cation compositions, and carbonate and bicarbonate concentrations were measured again after the purification procedure.
X-ray diffractograms were measured on a Rigaku Miniflex powder diffractometer. Cu Kα radiation, with λ = 1.54056 Å was used. The spectra were recorded over a 2θ range from 10–90°, using a step of 0.02°. Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out with a Shimadzu TGA-50, at 5°C min−1 scan rate from room temperature to 1000 °C in N2 atmosphere with a flux of 50 mL min−1.

In order to estimate the summation of all resistance elements within the electrolyzer, cell potential vs. current graphs for the first 50% of the electrolysis were plotted (Fig. S3†). Only the first half of the electrolysis was considered for this analysis, because we did not want to include data points where either solids could have formed on the membrane, and/or the ionic composition have become too low and hence RmC become too high. The data was rather noisy, which was attributed both to the absence of a regular register (no automated data acquisition), and constant CO2 sparging. Data points were fitted to a linear trend and the corresponding intercepts were interpreted as the summation of the thermodynamic equilibrium potential and the two electrodes' overpotentials. Thus, the cell potential, minus the intercept, divided by the applied current was interpreted as the summation of all resistance elements, following eqn (1):4 
−E = −ΔEe + |ηC| + |ηA| + i × (RCEM + RAEM + RaC + RmC + RcC + Rb,H2 + Rb,O2 + Rb,CO2 + RLi2CO3,ads + Rcat + Ran)

Volume changes in each compartment were directly measured with volumetric glassware. The changes in water mass in all three compartments were calculated by first converting solution volumes to mass (the respective density values used in calculations are listed in Table S1†). Next, the total dissolved solids value measured in each compartment was subtracted from the mass of solution.

3. Results and discussion
Lithium carbonate, Li2CO3, is one of the few common inorganic lithium products with a relatively low solubility in aqueous solution: 13.3 g kg−1 solution (0.18 mol kg−1) in water at 20 °C.47 Both Na2CO3 and K2CO3 display much higher water solubility values, 179 and 523 g kg−1 solution (1.69 and 3.80 mol kg−1) at the same temperature, respectively.47 Interestingly, Li2CO3 displays an inverse solubility with temperature. These differences allow for the crystallization of Li2CO3 even in the presence of larger amounts of Na+ and K+ in the feed solution. In order to crystallize high purity Li2CO3 the feed solution needs to have been fully depleted of multivalent species (notably Mg2+ and Ca2+) which will readily co-crystallize as either hydroxides or carbonates together with Li2CO3. However, the presence of both Na+ and K+ is not only tolerated, but even purposely increased. Indeed in the classic evaporitic technology, Li2CO3 is crystallized from a mixture of LiCl, NaCl and KCl by addition of Na2CO3.12
We have recently proposed an overall membrane electrolysis concept for the joint recovery of Li2CO3 and several by-products, fully schematized to the left of Fig. 1. In a first stage, production of hydroxyl anions in the cathodic compartment of a water electrolyser secures the full depletion of Mg2+ and Ca2+.48,49 The next step is to produce the partial abatement of Na+ cations via absorption of CO2 in the cathodic compartment of another electrolyser.48 In the final stage, Li2CO3 is crystallized.44 Key to this approach is to carefully control the pH in stages 2 and 3, by an interplay between CO2 flow and the applied current density.24 Our laboratory scale experiments have proved the potential of this overall approach. The undisputed advantages of this concept are the production of several by-products, including fresh water, the zero chemical approach, the fixation of CO2, its potential application to a large range of brine compositions, and the fact that it is weather independent and much faster than the evaporitic technology. These last two advantages are shared with most DLE technologies. On the down side, extensive process development is still needed, notably in dealing with the large production of solid products within electrochemical reactors, and the high energy cost, particularly in the depletion of Na+ cations.
While we like to refer to the overall electrolysis concept, it is important to acknowledge that particularly the first and last stages could be implemented individually. Key to the application of the last stage, is that the process needs to be fed with a solution where the Na+/Li+ ratio of concentrations has been depleted from the original ratio found in all types of native brines (continental, geothermal, produced waters in the oil industry, and even sea water).24 Alternatives to our full electrochemical approach include membranes that show preferential transport for Li+ over Na+ and K+,50–52 or thermal systems where brines are concentrated with concomitant water recovery, such as solar stills (bottom right of Fig. 1 (ref. 53)), or membrane distillation systems.54–56 Eventually, even brines concentrated in solar ponds could be fed into the system (bottom-centre of Fig. 1), allowing for a certain amount of freshwater recovery, and a zero chemical approach. Thus, in the work reported here our aim was to analyse how the different Na+/Li+ ratio of concentrations would affect the proposed membrane electrolysis concept.
In the water electrolyzer implemented here, the applied constant current forces cations to move towards the cathodic compartment and anions to move to the anodic compartment (Fig. 1, top). Fig. 2 depicts a monotonous decrease of the conductivity of the solution in the middle compartment (after a 1:100 dilution), Λ, while Fig. 4 shows the decrease in concentrations for K+, Na+ and Li+ cations in the same compartment. The conductivity values of the diluted samples cannot be used to extrapolate the conductivity values of the original solutions. Fig. S2† shows, as expected, that the electrolytic conductance is not proportional to the total concentration of ions. At higher total ionic concentration, the conductivity is higher than at lower total ionic concentrations, but this increment is not linearly proportional. This non-linearity suggests ion pairing or multiple ion associations.4 This is particularly noticeable for the experiments performed with [Na+]/[Li+] ratio of 4.80, and to a lesser extent, those of 3.74. Thus, while a higher conductivity in the middle compartment is best to decrease the cell voltage (Fig. S4†), the impact of this variable does not seem to be the most significant (see below).
 Fig. 2  Conductivity of the different test solutions in the middle compartment vs. the advancement of the electrolysis. All conductivity values correspond to 1:100 dilutions of the test solutions. 
In all four experiments the cell potentials remain fairly constant at roughly 3–4 V (Fig. S4†) when the applied current density was 50 A m−2. The cell potential increases sharply during the last 90% of the batch experiment. No unexpected phenomena seem to occur, and the electric potential responds linearly to the applied current density (Fig. S3†). The intercept values in Fig. S3† are very similar for all experiments with varying [Na+]/[Li+] ratios, which is to be expected considering that the electrochemical reactions (eqn (5) and (6)) are the same, and that the same electrodes were used. 
At the anode: 4OH− → O2(g) + 2H2O + 4e−
(5) 
At the cathode: 2H2O + 2e− → 2OH−(aq) + H2(g)
(6)
The thermodynamic E0 values for eqn (5) and (6) above are +0.64 V (pH = 10) and −0.66 V (pH = 11), respectively. In turn, the competitive reaction at the anode is eqn (7), which has a higher E0 = 1.36 V 
2Cl−(aq) → Cl2(g) + 2e−
(7)
Thus, by comparing the resulting ΔEe values for the two possible anodic reactions, data in Fig. S3 and S4† suggests that at pH = 10, the major reaction at the anode will be eqn (5). Otherwise, −(ΔEe − |ηC| − |ηA|) should be larger. As previously discussed,44 the use of a buffer to avoid Cl2 formation is only viable at laboratory scale. Otherwise, the definition of zero chemical process no longer holds. An easy way out is to introduce a fourth compartment that avoids the arrival of chloride anions at the anode, albeit at the expense of an added resistance due to a third membrane.
The summation of all resistance elements was plotted vs. the advancement of the electrolysis, see Fig. 3. Although there is some fluctuation in the experimental data, the four curves are almost indistinguishable, suggesting that the prevailing resistance elements are most likely the same in all 4 systems. Overall cell resistance values fluctuate around (3.2 ± 1.1) Ω for the first 80% of the electrolysis. RAEM and RCEM are the same in all 4 experiments. The manufacturer lists values of 0.4 Ω and 0.3 Ω for RAEM and RCEM, respectively (Table 1). The membrane resistance values will also fluctuate according to the solutions' compositions that are in contact with each membrane. Bubbles are very likely to introduce non-negligible resistance values, and these are also present in all 4 systems. Kiuchi et al. estimated the resistance values of gas bubbles to be 4 Ω or higher.57 While being non-conductive, and temporarily increasing the energy consumption of the electrolysis, the gas bubbles also promote a turbulent flow which favours mass transport, and renovate the diffusion layer in the vicinity of the membrane. There are two differences in the 4 experiments. Both the resistance of the solution in the middle compartment (RmC) and the resistance of the solution in the cathodic compartment (RcC) are different, at equal percentages of total circulated charge. However, for 80% of the electrolysis, values for RmC are the lowest of the three compartments, since it still is the most concentrated compartment. Following Fig. 2, and considering the cell dimensions, RmC can be estimated to be as low as 0.13 Ω (beginning of the experiment with highest TDS) and as high as about 1 Ω (80% completion of lowest TDS experiment). It is important to recall that the conductivity values were performed on 1:100 dilutions from the solution of interest and following Kohlrausch's laws the conductivity is not linearly dependent on concentration.4 While we acknowledge that our home-made reactor setup is far from being an optimized design, understanding the different resistance components in a prospective electrochemical system is paramount for prospective technological implementation. Decreasing the width of the middle compartment, and using membranes with lower resistance values will be key in reducing the overall cell resistance, and hence the energy consumption of the process. Novel reactor designs should simultaneously address the issue of solid formation and intense sparging in the vicinity of the electrode surfaces. Towards the end of the batch runs, the total impedance values increase due to the formation of insulate carbonates which can be adsorbed on the membrane. Furthermore, this increase is caused by the depletion of ions in the middle compartment. At this point, water splitting on the membranes occurs, and is evidenced by a decrease of the pH in the brines, see below.
 Fig. 3  Total cell resistance. The Y axis was calculated using the cell potential directly measured in the DC power supply, minus the estimated ΔEe − |ηC| − |ηA| values, and the applied current. 
Table 3 shows initial and final composition for the different solutions fed to the middle compartment of the electrolysis cell. Na+ initial concentrations were gradually increased while K+ and Li+ were kept constant. Thus, the initial value of total dissolved solids is increased. After completion of the electrolysis, it is observed that the TDS values in the middle compartment were reduced by three orders of magnitude indicating, once again, that most of the ions successfully migrated to the side compartments. In the middle compartment, neither the final concentrations of the cations, nor the TDS final values follow a clear trend with the initial solutions concentrations. This is attributed to the fact that some electrolysis experiments were not immediately stopped when the cell voltage reached 30 V, but a few hours later. TDS and ionic composition greatly increased in the catholyte; the magnitudes of these increments are correlated with the changes in solution volume.

A very clear trend can be observed for the volume changes in the middle and cathodic compartments, see Table 4. Unfortunately, the proportion of fresh water recovered in the middle compartment is lower when Na+ concentration is highest, these values go from 78.7% to 56.5% of the original water content in the feed. A large electro-osmotic effect can explain this phenomenon, in which water molecules solvating the ions pass through membranes accompanying the migrating ions. The larger the absolute number of ions being transported across the membranes, the larger the extent of the electro-osmotic effect. There is a correlation between water loss in the middle compartment and water gain in the cathodic and the anodic compartments, and total number of charged particles initially present in each brine. It is still important to recall that even in the worst case scenario, our strategy allows for the recovery of over half of the original water content in the feed solutions, whereas the current evaporitic technology produces the loss of 100% of the water content.

Table 5 shows physico-chemical properties of the solutions in the middle compartment after electrolysis completion. Chloride concentrations at the end of the experiments also indicate electrolysis completion, e.g. the remaining Cl− represents 0.03% of the original content in the compartment. The pH values are slightly alkaline; this could be explained by water splitting on membranes as shown in Fig. 7b, see below. In all cases, TDS at the end of the batch runs are lower than 2% (except for the first experiment) which is similar to the fresh water of wetlands. These TDS values are in good agreement with the conductivity measurements. In addition to specific upper limits for selected ions, fresh water is considered suitable for irrigation when its conductivity is in the range 150–500 μS cm−1.58 It can be observed that this is the case for three of the four experimental runs, the experiment with lowest total ionic composition does not fall far from the upper limit either. In order to more precisely compare the final results, it would have been necessary to precisely control the point when the experiments were considered as finished. It has to be acknowledged, however, that a techno-economic decision as to when it is more suitable to end an electrolysis, will not only be based on solution composition, but also on the overall operational cost. It is evident from Fig. 3 that the process becomes much more energy intensive for the last 20% of the electrolysis.

Coming back to Fig. 4, we observe that in all 4 cases studied, K+ cations move across the membrane faster than both Na+ and Li+, while Na+ moves faster than Li+. For example, when 40% of the total charge has circulated, in the middle compartment the Li+ concentration remains at about 90% of its initial concentration, while the K+ concentration has decreased below 50%, for all the experiments with different initial Li+/Na+ concentration ratios. This behaviour is consistent with our previous work,44,48 as well as reports by other authors.27–29 Fig. S5† superposes data for the same cations and results are surprisingly similar despite the increasing Na+ concentration. The separation coefficients shown in Fig. 5 compare the migration rates across the membrane. Fig. 6 shows the first derivative of data shown in Fig. 4, indicating how fast the concentrations for each cation are reduced in the middle compartment. The derivative of the summation of the dimensionless cation concentration is also shown (total cation concentration divided by total initial cation concentration, in molar units, green curves). In the first half of the experiments, K+ disappears faster than Na+ and Li+. From roughly 55 to 75% of the total circulated charge, Na+ moves faster than K+ and Li+, respectively. It is only in the last quarter of the electrolysis that Li+ migration begins to increase and rapidly disappears from the middle compartment. This behaviour is interesting to consider when an electrolysis is performed because Li+ passes through the CEM at the end of the experiment and can be recovered at this time.

The green curves correspond to the derivatives of the dimensionless summation of all cations. Panels (A–D) correspond to increasing [Na+]/[Li+] ratio. 
The final catholyte composition (Table 3) shows that Li+ and K+ concentrations decrease when the [Na+]/[Li+] ratio of concentrations increases. This is easily explained by the increase in the catholyte volume, i.e. the total amount of Li+ and K+ cations in solution is fairly constant. A precise mass balance was not calculated since all three cations are present in the catholyte, the first solid (prior to re-suspension in hot water), and the solutions used for washing and re-suspension, see below.
Fig. 7a shows the evolution of pH in the middle compartment for each batch run. The pH values of above 9 throughout most of the electrolysis are first attributed to the Lewis acid behaviour of Li+ ions in aqueous solutions. The pH remains roughly constant for most of the electrolysis. It is also observed that the pH is slightly higher for experiments with higher total salinity. Only after about 90% of the total charge has circulated does the pH decrease. For the experiment with [Na+]/[Li+] = 1.24, the pH decreases to pH = 7.3 and this is observed when 95.0% of the total charge has circulated. For the other experiments, the pH goes down for circulated charge values of 93.9%, 96.4% and 96.9% for increasing [Na+]/[Li+] ratios, reaching pH values close to 2. In all 4 experiments, towards the very end of the run, the pH value returns to about 8. Both the initial decrease and final increase in pH values in the middle compartment are attributed to water splitting on membranes.59,60 Fig. 7b schematizes these processes.
 Fig. 7  (A) pH evolution in the middle compartment with the extent of electrolysis. (B) Schematic representation of the water splitting processes in both AEM and CEM. 
In an aqueous solution with a much depleted ionic concentration, in order to allow for charge transfer due to an applied electric field, water can split into H+ and OH−.61 The chemical nature of the ionic exchange membranes used in this work can allow for this splitting, and thus promote migration of, alternately, H+ and OH−, to the middle compartment. In the case of anion exchange membranes with quaternary ammonium residues, hydroxyl anions can migrate from the membrane to the anolyte.59,62 In turn, protons are repelled from the membrane and migrate in the same direction of the electric field. The reduced pH in the middle compartment towards the end of the electrolysis is attributed to this phenomenon.
Water splitting produces a reduced coulombic efficiency, since a share of the electric current will not result in cation transfer towards the cathodic compartment. Table 3 shows that the coulombic efficiency of the overall process (i.e. calculated over the whole duration of the electrolysis) is above 99.7% for all experiments. Therefore, we can conclude that while water splitting produces a highly noticeable effect in the middle compartment, which at this point has a very low total ionic composition, it is only a very minor process over the whole electrolysis. Moreover, water splitting did not produce any measurable pH changes in the cathodic or anodic compartments. This was attributed to the strong buffer concentration in the latter, and the constant production of hydroxyl anions at the cathode, which is certainly predominant over the few protons that might be generated at the membrane. Overall, no effects on the product purity could be attributed to the water splitting. However, potential detrimental consequences could be observed upon working under different conditions, such as higher current densities, or permselective membranes of different chemical nature, both of which could increase the extent of the water splitting phenomenon. The product yield was not quantified, and we do acknowledge that water splitting could potentially have an effect on this parameter as well.
According to the pH changes observed in our experiments, it seems that water splitting only occurs at the cation exchange membrane at a later stage of the batch run. Data in Fig. 6 and 7 correlate quite well. Fig. 6 shows that the rate of cation transfer across the cation exchange membrane is roughly constant (all 3 cations analysed together, within experimental error), except for approximately the last 5% of the electrolysis. Thus, the final pH increase corresponds to a marked diminution of the rate of consumption of all cations in the middle compartment. The advancement of the electrolysis is quantified in terms of total circulated charge, thus, a diminution in the rate of K+/Na+/Li+ transfer must be associated with other species compensating for the charge transfer, i.e. water splitting at the CEM. This is also in line with the fact that the higher the total amount of ions in solution, the later the decrease in pH is observed, since at a given % of total circulated charge the absolute number of ions is different for the 4 tests. The last panel (ratio of concentrations = 4.80) does not seem to follow this trend, which is in principle attributed to experimental errors in the Li+ concentrations; smalls errors become more evident in the derivatives. Water splitting at membranes is a complex phenomenon that should be studied more in depth in our current system.
The solids crystallized in the side vessel attached to the cathodic compartment were first analysed following vacuum filtration and a very simple washing step. The X-ray diffractograms shown in Fig. 8a suggest 4 pure solids were obtained. However, both the thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. 8b), and the concentrations determined by atomic spectroscopy and volumetric titration (Table 6) show otherwise, with purity rapidly decreasing as the [Na+]/[Li+] ratio was increased in the feed solutions. Because no impurities are observed by X-ray diffraction, even when the solid is only 50% pure, it seems that the impurity salts were adsorbed on Li2CO3 rather than co-crystallization phenomena having occurred. Moreover, K2CO3, NaHCO3, and Na2CO3 are all known to be much more water soluble than Li2CO3 particularly in hot water.47 Thus, the solids were re-suspended in 90 °C de-ionized water and sonicated. After this procedure, Na+, K+ and HCO−3 were all below detection limits, and quantification of Li+ in the solid indicated Li2CO3 purity above 99.9%. This purification procedure was straightforward and could very easily be implemented at industrial scale, thus we can consider that the electrochemical methodology studied here is capable of producing battery grade Li2CO3.

4. Conclusions
We have proposed an overall electrochemical technology for the joint production of Li2CO3 and other raw materials from complex brines. Our proposed approach entails the electrochemical production of hydroxyl anions that will accelerate the absorption of CO2. Li2CO3 crystallization will occur provided the pH is constantly monitored so that the applied current density can be adjusted to secure a range of pH where carbonate is the major carbon species.
Our electrochemical proposal aims at the production of Li2CO3 from a complex broth, i.e. not departing from pure precursors. Thus, we have studied its performance as the ratio of [Na+]/[Li+] is increased. The as-crystallized product showed an important decrease in purity as the ratio of [Na+]/[Li+] was increased. However, Li2CO3 with purity above 99.9% could be produced upon re-suspension in 90 °C de-ionized water, a readily scalable procedure. Upon increasing the [Na+]/[Li+] 4 times, no major changes were observed in the electrochemical performance. The voltage difference between the anode and cathode suggested that the overpotentials remained fairly constant, while the summation of all resistance elements was mostly governed by the ion exchange membranes and the gas bubbles. Despite the increase in total salinity in the middle compartment, the voltage difference was very similar for all systems.
While the increase in total salinity did not impact the purity of the product upon washing, it will have two other consequences. At higher [Na+]/[Li+] ratios, the electrical cost for the process will be largely increased. The potential difference will be the same, but a larger number of ions will need to be transferred across the membranes, requiring larger total electric charge. A major difference in this approach as compared to other hydrometallurgical processes is the production of fresh water as a by-product of a mining process. However, the proportion of water contained in the original feed that is successfully recovered decreases with higher total salinity in the feed. Not only is water lost as a consequence of water electrolysis, a process that could be reversed in a fuel cell, but water molecules are transferred to the concentrated compartments via electro-osmosis.
In this work, the coulombic efficiency has been calculated in terms of the amount of current successfully used to transfer cations across the membrane to the cathodic compartment. If we were to recalculate this parameter following the more classical definition of the percentage of electrons successfully used to synthesize the product of interest, the results would be much lower. This is, firstly, because a larger proportion of the electrons was used to transfer the co-existing cations, Na+, K+, that will remain in the catholyte and not yield a product of interest, and secondly, because Li2CO3 still shows a non-negligible water solubility and a part of the product will remain in solution. The low coulombic efficiency, in its classical definition, is the weakest point in our proposed methodology. With the high prices for battery grade Li2CO3, currently at about 70000 US$ per tonne, almost any proposed technology for its production is profitable. While the results shown here have proved that as much as 5 times the molar ratio of Na+/Li+ still produces a high purity Li2CO3 product, any pre-processing reducing both Na+ and K+ content will reduce the production costs.
While this approach presents many potential benefits as compared to both traditional brine mining and other novel DLE approaches, lots of work remains to be undertaken if these ideas are to be taken to a higher technological readiness level. Key for the successful scaling up will be to further develop pre-processing strategies, and to re-configure the reactor setup so that crystals will not be formed in the vicinity of ion exchange membranes.
