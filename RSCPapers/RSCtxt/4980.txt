Introduction
Photoelectrochemical solar cells utilize a dye to sensitize an inorganic semiconducting electrode to visible light. One of the most promising examples of these dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is based on a ruthenium dye adsorbed on a nanocrystalline titanium dioxide (nc-TiO2) electrode immersed in a liquid electrolyte.1 The intimate contact between the dye and TiO2 promotes charge transfer and the large interface ensures efficient light absorption. Several inorganic and organic dyes have been tested in combination with TiO2.2 The most efficient dyes, Ru(NCS)2(dcbpy)2
(dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine) and Ru(NCS)3(tcterpy)2
(tcterpy = 4,4′,4″-tricarboxy-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine), provide power conversion efficiencies of over 10% under standard solar light (AM 1.5) conditions.3 In recent years, solid-state DSSCs have attracted the attention of researchers in the field. Here, the liquid electrolyte is replaced by a solid, wide band gap hole conductor.4 In addition, the combination of π-conjugated polymers with inorganic semiconductors (such as TiO2 and CdS) is of interest because the π-conjugated polymer can act simultaneously as sensitizer and hole transport medium.5,6 The performance of these hybrid polymer–inorganic semiconductor solar cells is limited at present. Problems are encountered in filling the nanosized pores efficiently, mainly because diffusion of polymer chains into the pores is slow. Although larger pores alleviate this problem, the limited exciton diffusion length of conjugated polymers (typically ∼10 nm) makes nanosized organization of the two components a necessity for efficient charge generation.7 The incomplete filling and the associated problems in charge generation and charge transport have, to date, hindered the exploitation of the true potential of these polymer sensitizers in hybrid cells.
Well-defined π-conjugated oligomers have been widely used to investigate the intrinsic properties of polymeric semiconductors in detail.8 Here, we use an oligomer to study the interaction of π-conjugated semiconductors with nc-TiO2 in more detail. To enhance adsorption at the polar TiO2 surface, we use an oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) with three phenyl groups (OPV3) functionalized with a carboxylic acid moiety (OPV3-COOH; Fig. 1) and employ nc-TiO2 with pore sizes of the order of 12 nm. The filling of the pores by OPV3-COOH is studied via Langmuir isotherms and compared to a related aldehyde-functionalized oligomer (OPV3-CHO). Photoluminescence and photoinduced absorption spectroscopies are used to show that efficient charge transfer occurs at the OPV3-COOH/nc-TiO2 interface. DSSCs based on OPV3-COOH as the sensitizer and nc-TiO2 provide an incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 55% at the maximum absorption and show that most of the photogenerated charges can be collected.

Results and discussion
Interaction of OPV3-COOH with nc-TiO2
Optically transparent nc-TiO2 films of about 700 nm thickness were prepared on glass substrates as described in the Experimental section. After sintering at 450 °C, the nc-TiO2 has a BET surface area of 116 m2 g−1. Assuming spherical, monodisperse particles, this corresponds to an average particle size of ca. 12 nm. The affinity of OPV3-COOH (Mw
= 857 g mol−1) for the nc-TiO2 surface was studied by measuring the optical absorbance of the films after dipping the glass substrate in toluene (relative permittivity, εr
= 2.38) containing OPV3-COOH in concentrations ranging from 10−6 to 10−3 M. After staining, the substrate was rinsed with toluene to remove any OPV3-COOH adsorbed on the outside. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of OPV3-COOH in toluene shows a characteristic π–π* transition at λ
= 430 nm (S1←S0), similar to that reported for a methyl end-capped OPV3 oligomer (λ
= 440 nm).9 Upon adsorption of OPV3-COOH, the absorption maximum of the oligomer shifts to λ
= 400 nm, while the onset appears at slightly higher wavelengths (Fig. 2). These changes indicate that the OPV3-COOH chromophores assemble into H-aggregates at the TiO2 surface.9 Increasing the oligomer concentration in the solution leads to more highly colored TiO2, until the TiO2 surface becomes fully saturated. In toluene, OPV3-COOH has a strong affinity for nc-TiO2; even at low concentrations (10−5 M), the nc-TiO2 film becomes strongly colored. It is important to note that the adsorption characteristics vary with solvent polarity. In more polar solvents like CHCl3
(εr
= 4.8) and THF (εr
= 7.8), OPV3-COOH has a lesser tendency to adsorb on the polar TiO2.

The association constant for OPV3-COOH on nc-TiO2 can be calculated via the surface concentration (Γ) and surface enlargement (η) of TiO2. The surface enlargement of the porous TiO2 film can be calculated from the Braunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) surface area (ABET), the density of TiO2
(ρTiO2), the layer thickness (d), and the porosity (por)
viaeqn. 1. η
=
ABETdρTiO2(1 − por)(1)The experimental values of ABET
= 116 m2 g−1, ρ
= 4200 kg m−3, d
= 700 nm, and por = 0.68 result in a surface enlargement of η
= 109. The surface concentration of OPV3-COOH (ε
= 4.4 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1) in the porous layer can be obtained from the optical density (OD). (2)The plot of the surface concentration versus the oligomer concentration of the solution (Fig. 3) can be interpreted in terms of a Langmuir isotherm (eqn. 3). (3)For toluene, this results in a maximum surface concentration of Γmax
≈ 1.9 µmol m−2 and an association constant of K
≈ 2.2 × 105 M−1
(Fig. 3).10 An estimate for the molecular surface area (Amol) for a OPV3-COOH molecule can be calculated viaeqn. 4. (4)The molecular surface area is Amol
= 88 Å2, in good agreement with a value of 84 Å2 obtained for a comparable OPV molecule via a Langmuir–Blodgett technique.11 Molecular modeling indicates that such a molecular surface area is only possible when the molecules have an angle of almost 90° with respect to the surface. The dense packing of the OPV3-COOH monolayer within the pores is consistent with the observed blue shift of the UV-Vis absorption spectrum when the OPV3 chromophore is adsorbed on nc-TiO2.

Knowing the maximum optical density (ODmax
= 0.85), an estimate can be made for the fraction of the pore volume of nc-TiO2 that is filled with the OPV3-COOH oligomer (XOPV) using eqn. 5. (5)Assuming an estimated density of ρOPV
= 1000 kg m−3 for OPV3-COOH, eqn. 5 leads to a volume fraction of the nc-TiO2 pores filled with the OPV3-COOH of XOPV
= 35%. Hence, just simply covering nc-TiO2 with a monolayer of OPV3-COOH leads to a significant loading of the pores.
As a control experiment, and to illustrate the importance of the anchoring carboxylic acid group, the association of an aldehyde-functionalized OPV3 molecule (OPV3-CHO) onto nc-TiO2 was measured. After dipping the TiO2 substrate into OPV3-CHO solutions, weakly colored films were obtained when concentrations in the range of 10−6–10−3 M were used. As a consequence of the low affinity of the aldehyde-functionalized oligomer for binding to TiO2, large fluctuations in the values of the optical density occurred and, hence, the association constant could not be measured accurately.
Energetic considerations for the photophysics of OPV3-COOH and TiO2
The singlet excited-state energy, or optical band gap, of OPV3-COOH is 2.24 eV, as determined from the photoluminescence maximum (λ
= 553 nm) of a thin film on quartz with excitation at 488 nm [Fig. 4(a), solid line]. The band gap of nanocrystalline TiO2 has been reported to be 3.2 eV.12 The electrochemical oxidation of OPV3-COOH in dichloromethane is chemically reversible and has a first oxidation potential at Eox
= 0.90 V vs. the standard calomel electrode (SCE). Compared to methyl end-capped OPV3 (Eox
= 0.83 V vs. SCE), OPV3-COOH is slightly more difficult to oxidize due to the electron-withdrawing character of the carboxylic group. The molecules cannot be reduced reversibly. Using the optical band gap of 2.24 eV, the reduction potential is approximated to be at Ered
≅
−1.34 V vs. SCE. The redox properties of nc-TiO2 are well known and the reduction potential has been reported to be Ered
=
−0.7 V vs. SCE.12 Considering the band gaps and the redox potentials, both photoinduced energy transfer from TiO2 towards the OPV3 chromophore and photoinduced electron transfer from OPV3-COOH to TiO2 are energetically possible.

Photophysics of the OPV3-COOH:TiO2 system
Photoexcitation of a drop-cast film of OPV3-COOH on quartz gives a strong fluorescence at 553 nm [Fig. 4(a), solid line]. This emission is reduced by a factor of 40 when the OPV3-COOH is absorbed within the nanoporous TiO2 [Fig. 4(a), dashed line]. The large reduction in luminescence of the OPV3 chromophore can be explained by a fast photoinduced electron transfer from the oligomer to the metal oxide, which deactivates the OPV3-COOH singlet excited state before luminescence can occur.
Direct spectral evidence of charge formation was obtained by near steady-state photoinduced absorption (PIA) spectroscopy. First, the PIA spectrum of the pristine compound on a quartz substrate was measured, showing a single broad absorption band around 1.80 eV, which is typical for a triplet–triplet transition [Fig. 4(b), solid line]. When OPV3-COOH is adsorbed onto TiO2, the PIA spectrum changes dramatically and two characteristic peaks in the visible and near-IR energy regions at 0.80 and 1.65–1.90 eV are observed, which are attributed to the radical cation of OPV3-COOH [Fig. 4(b), dashed line].13 The shoulder at 1.65 eV can be assigned to both a vibronic band of the high energy radical cation band of OPV3-COOH and to the radical anion of TiO2.14 The bands at 0.80, 1.65, and 1.90 eV result from the same species, as they show a similar decay upon changing the modulation frequency.
In conclusion, we have direct evidence for photoinduced charge separation between OPV3-COOH and TiO2. Importantly, the large decrease in photoluminescence points to efficient charge formation. It is likely that the strong association of OPV3-COOH with TiO2 enhances the photoinduced electron transfer reaction, as the exciton diffusion length is minimized.
Photovoltaic characteristics
The efficient photoinduced electron transfer between OPV3-COOH and nc-TiO2 makes the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells with the OPV3-COOH molecule as the sensitizer a possibility. A photovoltaic device was constructed with the same configuration as used in ruthenium dye sensitized TiO2 cells (SnO2:F/TiO2:dye/liquid electrolyte/Pt/SnO2:F), employing an I2/I3− liquid electrolyte as a medium for hole transport. At the maximum absorption of the OPV3 chromophore around 400 nm, the IPCE amounts to 55%, comparable to the maximum IPCE value of a similarly prepared Ru(NCS)2(dcbpy)2-sensitized cell (Fig. 5). For the Ru dye sensitized cell, an IPCE value of 55% is rather low, indicating that these cells are far from optimized. Nevertheless, a comparison between identically processed cells is valid. An IPCE value for a cell using OPV3-COOH comparable to that observed for a Ru dye sensitized cell demonstrates that not only is the charge generation efficient, but also the collection efficiency is high. This indicates that the charge recombination across the TiO2/OPV3-COOH interface is appreciably slower than the forward electron transfer. Of course, it should be recognized that the OPV chromophore has a reduced range of absorption (λ
= 300–500 nm) within the solar spectrum compared to ruthenium dyes (λ
= 300–700 nm) and will give lower power conversion efficiencies in solar light.

Conclusions
Functionalizing a small oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) with a carboxylic acid group (OPV3-COOH) results in a strong interaction with nc-TiO2 electrodes, and leads to strongly colored films after staining. The high affinity of the dye for the metal oxide and the possibility of using TiO2 having pores with dimensions in the exciton diffusion range leads to complete surface coverage and 35% filling of the pores, together with an almost complete formation of charges after photoexcitation. The blue shift of the absorption maximum strongly suggests the occurrence of intermolecular interactions between the oligomers due to the dense packing within the TiO2. The OPV dye was tested as a sensitizer for nc-TiO2 in solar cells using a liquid electrolyte. The IPCE reaches a value of 55% around the maximum absorption. Future experiments will be directed towards longer oligomers and polymers with an acid group that still can fill the pores within TiO2. Longer oligomers have a greater potential for dye sensitization of TiO2 as their absorption maxima and extinction coefficients are higher. Moreover, it is expected that longer oligomers with enhanced intermolecular interactions may facilitate lateral transport of holes towards the electrodes, making the use of a liquid electrolyte superfluous.
Experimental
The synthesis of the acid- and aldehyde-functionalized OPV3 compounds is described elsewhere.11a Dye adsorption measurements were performed using optically transparent nanocrystalline titanium dioxide films (thickness 700 nm, determined by SEM; BET surface area 116 m2 g−1; porosity 68%) made by spin coating two layers of a TiO2 colloid (15 wt% in water; S5-300B, Millennium Chemicals), stabilized with 1% methyl cellulose (Aldrich), and sintering at 450 °C for 15 min. All other experiments were carried out with transparent nanocrystalline TiO2 films (thickness 3.5 µm, determined by SEM; BET surface area 96 m2 g−1; porosity 50%), made from a commercially available nc-TiO2 paste (Ti-nanoxide HT, Solaronix), applied by the ‘squeegee’ technique and sintered at 450 °C for 15 min. Staining was carried out overnight at room temperature in an inert atmosphere.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed on a JEOL JSM 6330-F field emission scanning electron microscope and the BET surface area and porosity were determined using a Coulter Omnisorp 360 gas sorption analyzer.
UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 40 and Lambda 900 spectrophotometers, fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS50B equipped with a red-sensitive Hamamatsu R928-08 photomultiplier for fluorescence. Fluorescence spectra are not corrected for the wavelength dependence of the sensitivity of the detection system.
Near steady-state PIA spectroscopy was performed using a home-made set-up, as described previously.6
Cyclic voltammograms were recorded in inert atmosphere with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in dichloromethane as supporting electrolyte using a Potentioscan Wenking POS73 potentiostat. The substrate concentration was typically 10−3 M. The working electrode was a platinum disc (0.2 cm2), the counter-electrode was a platinum plate (0.5 cm2), and a saturated calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode, calibrated against the Fc/Fc+ couple (+0.470 V vs. SCE).
The solvents for absorption measurements were used as received; solvents for cyclic voltammetry measurements were distilled before use.
Photovoltaic cells (active area = 3.75 cm2) were prepared from a layer of Solaronix paste on conductive SnO2:F (Libbey Owens Ford), stained with 3 × 10−4 M solutions of either OPV3-COOH in toluene or Ru(NCS)2(dcbpy)2
(Solaronix) in ethanol. The SnO2:F counter-electrode had two small filling holes and was activated by a thin layer of Pt, applied by drop casting a solution of H2PtCl6 in ethanol and subsequent firing at 450 °C for 15 min. The electrodes were joined with a thin strip of hotmelt (Surlyn 1702, Dupont) around the active area. After filling with electrolyte (0.4 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.3 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in 3-methoxypropionitrile), the holes were sealed with a thin glass slide and Surlyn. The spectral response (IPCE) was measured using a Spectrolab XT-10 solar simulator according to the ASTM E1021-84 norm. This method is based on continuous irradiation of the test device to maintain one sun working conditions. The spectral response is revealed using pulsed monochromatic illumination by means of a chopped light beam (frequency 8 Hz). A lock-in technique is used to distinguish the pulsed current output signal from the total output current under short-circuit conditions. A calibrated GaAs cell is used as a reference.
