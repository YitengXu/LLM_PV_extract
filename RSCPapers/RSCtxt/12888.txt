1. Introduction
Carbon neutrality means having a balance between emitting and absorbing carbon in the atmosphere, which is in favour of the sustainable development of human society. Thus, increasing the percentage of renewable energies, such as solar and wind power, is an effective way to reduce carbon emission from the energy supply side.1–5 Electrochemical energy storage devices, which can act as a buffer to store surplus energy during the abundant period and supply energy during the shortage time, are an essential component of the renewable energy systems with non-sequential and unstable nature.6 Zinc–bromine batteries (ZBBs) are promising candidates for applications in distributed energy storage and have received much attention, due to their long cycle life, high safety, high theoretical energy density (440 W h kg−1), 100% depth of discharge capability and scalable capacity.7
The concept of zinc–bromine battery (ZBB) proposed by Bradley can be dated back to 1885.8,9 Secondary zinc–bromine cells were made by Sidney and David in Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1964.10 The zinc–bromine flow battery (ZBFB) was initially developed by Gould Inc. and Exxon Research and Engineering Company in the late 1970s.11 At the outset, ZBFBs were envisaged for electric vehicles and utility load levelling.12–14 Further advancements continued in Energy Research Corp. and Johnson Controls Inc. (under the direction of Sandia National Laboratories), Meidensha Electric Co. and SEA GmbH.15 Currently, many companies are engaged in the research and commercialization of ZBFBs, including Redflow Ltd (Australia), EnSync Energy Systems (USA), Zbest Power Co. Ltd (China), Lotte Chemical Corp. (Korea) and Primus Power (USA).
In a typical ZBB, the Br2/Br− redox couple is used in the cathode of ZBB based on the following reaction: Br2(aq) + 2e− ⇌ 2Br−(aq) (E⊖ = 1.065 V vs. SHE)(1)And the Zn2+/Zn redox couple is employed in the anode: Zn2+(aq) + 2e− ⇌ Zn(s) (E⊖ = −0.763 V vs. SHE)(2)Summation of the above equations generates the cell reaction: Br2(aq) + Zn(s) ⇌ 2Br−(aq) + Zn2+(aq)(3)Therefore, its thermodynamic cell potential, Ecell, is 1.828 V.12 Actually, internal resistance causes a decrease in the discharge voltage in practice.10,16 During charging, a layer of zinc is electrodeposited on the surface of the anode with the simultaneous oxidation of Br− to Br2 at the cathode. When discharging, the electrochemical reactions of the battery follow the direction of equation (3). However, although great progress has been made in both basic and applied research studies, efforts should be made continuously to improve the overall performance of ZBBs to meet the increasing needs.
Herein, from the aspects of the structure, electrolyte, anode, cathode and membrane, we review the development of ZBBs, discuss the key problems and technical challenges, and propose the perspectives for the future, with a focus on material and chemistry. This perspective provides valuable information on further advancement of ZBBs.
2. Review and discussion
2.1 Structure
In the initial stage, ZBBs were made using a static aqueous ZnBr2 electrolyte and carbon plate electrodes separated by a multi-layered porous membrane. To lower the diffusion rate of bromine, activated charcoal was used to cover the cathode, which could allow it to be used vertically (Fig. 1a). The cathode without activated charcoal exhibited better performance horizontally.10 A rechargeable zinc–bromine battery with a circulating aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 1b), called ZBFB now, was designed and demonstrated a round-trip energy efficiency (EE) of 80% at a current density of 20 mA cm−2 with a charge capacity of 200 mA h cm−2, which has attracted attention since then.17 The ZBFB system, its structure, the test program/procedures and the results with multikilowatt hour capacity size ranges have been demonstrated, which lighted a torch of hope and promoted the development of ZBFBs.18,19 The electrolyte was circulated through the battery with two separate tanks for the catholyte and anolyte. To suppress the self-discharge derived from the chemical reaction of zinc and bromine, the Nafion 125 membrane was used and exhibited good performance.17 The Nafion membrane has been used in the field of ZBBs since then. The corrosion problem from bromine to graphite electrode has been noticed. However, the cyclic performance of the battery is not yet tested. A novel ZBFB without the storage tank, pump and pipeline of the catholyte side was fabricated by Li et al. to increase the practical energy density (Fig. 1c).20 Bromine in the charged state was sealed inside the chamber of the positive electrode to avoid bromine leak into the environment. This design shows a series of distinct advantages; however, it puts forward high requirements on the membrane at the same time. Another type of ZBFB with only a single flow was designed by Suss et al.21 The electrolyte consisting of the Br2-poor aqueous and Br2-rich polybromide phases flows through this battery with the help of a pump. The positive and negative electrodes live together in one cavity without a membrane. A high Zn loading of 250 mA h cm−2 can be obtained in their prototype cell. The miniaturisation of ZBFBs has been tried by Lee et al. for the special and portable applications.22

In addition, carbon felt has so many advantages, including a high specific surface area, excellent corrosion and oxidation resistance, and high electrical conductivity, that it is widely used in the anode and cathode sides, as a strategy parallel to the cavity in both sides in ZBBs and ZBFBs. However, the limited electrocatalytic activity of carbon felt compels the conventional ZBFBs to be operated at a low power density.23 An asymmetrical ZBFB fabricated by replacing carbon felt with a thinner electrocatalytically active carbon paper electrode was proposed by Zhao et al.24 Besides, a decreased internal resistance can be achieved by using the positive collector of graphite plate with a flow-field structure. These two aspects of improvement result in better performances of ZBFBs than the conventional structure.
From the techno-economic point of view, a low-cost, single-chamber, membrane-free ZBB without forced convection was proposed and fabricated.25 In this design, a porous carbon foam was prepared and used to fix bromine; zinc dendrites were allowed to grow up freely to some extent. This concept of novel zinc–bromine battery is suggestive to the further optimization of ZBBs. To shorten the current travel distance and then decrease the effective electrical resistance, a stackable bipolar pouch ZBB with a light-weight corrosion-resistant carbon black/polyethylene collector could operate stably in a variety of aqueous electrolytes, which is good for scalable integration of ZBBs.26 Aiming to avoid the growth of zinc dendrites and increase the transport rate of the reactant, Dawson fabricated and investigated a novel fluidized bed zinc positive electrode and different electrode feeder materials.27 The membraneless and flowless structure was designed to decrease the cost (Fig. 1d). However, an advanced electrode capturing bromine and polybromide anions have to be employed to avoid self-discharge and capacity fade.28 The non-flow ZBB with a glass fibre separator was achieved with the help of terapropylammonium bromide (TPABr), which showed an ultra-stable cycling life for over 11000 cycles with a controlled self-discharge rate.29
To increase the output voltage, a hybrid ZBB with acid (+)-alkaline (−) electrolytes separated by a bipolar membrane was fabricated, which provided an average operating voltage of 2.1 V and exhibited excellent cyclic stability (2000 cycles).30 Another aqueous hybrid ZBB with a neutral (+)-alkaline (−) electrolyte was developed.31 The redox couples of Br2/Br− and [Zn(OH)4]2−/Zn are segregated by a Nafion-based K+-conducting membrane. This type of ZBB delivered a high average output voltage of 2.15 V and an energy density of 276.7 W h kg−1. The design of the hybrid electrolyte overcomes the operating voltage limitation (<1.8 V) of the traditional aqueous electrolyte. In addition, a novel aqueous zinc–bromine “supercapattery” was fabricated by Wang et al.32 This device successfully integrates electrical-double-layer, pseudocapacitive and battery-type charge storage mechanism at the same time, which is able to provide both high peak power and high energy output.
Models of mathematics, electrochemistry and simulation were employed as an aid for the design of ZBFBs, the calculation of current distributions, the optimization of the residence time for bromine in the storage tank, investigation of the fluidized bed anode reactor, and finally the improvement in their performances, which help us to understand the specific principle in-depth and propose more optimized innovative design.27,33–38 A simplified battery structure is always adopted to quantitatively study the fundamental problems. The sources of voltage loss were illuminated in a minimal architecture of ZBB using the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.39 It could be found that the main factors leading to the voltage loss are the ohmic resistances in the current collectors of carbon cloth and the electrolyte.
Considering all of the above mentioned battery designs, it is really a good idea to solve some specific problems in ZBBs from the structural perspective. Structural optimization could determine the main direction of research and development for the components in a battery system. Therefore, advancement in the ZBB structure is desired and meaningful.
2.2 Electrolyte
Initially, the electrolyte of ZBBs consisted only of ZnBr2.10 In 1977, KCl was studied as a supporting electrolyte for ZBFB, which was more effective in lowering resistivity compared with NaCl.17 To further improve the performance, zinc perchlorate was tried as the supporting electrolyte, which could increase the rate of zinc dissolution by improving the reaction rate of bromine.40 The supporting electrolyte with NH4Cl was investigated.41 It was found that, compared with the electrolyte without a supporting electrolyte, the use of 4 M NH4Cl improved the EE by ∼14%.
Although acetonitrile solution was used to study the kinetics of bromine–tribromide–bromide redox processes,42 the aqueous solution still is the mainstream. Further developments of ZBBs have been impeded by self-discharge, associated with high bromine solubility and diffusion into the aqueous electrolyte. To solve this problem, although the strategy of bromine-propionitrile/water has been tried,43 bromine complexation with quaternary ammonium bromides (QBr) has attracted the attention of many scientists. The bromine-rich liquid can separate from the aqueous solution due to insolubility and density difference.44 A high Coulombic efficiency (CE) can be achieved by using a bromine complexing agent together with an inexpensive microporous separator and a low bromine vapour pressure can be realized as well. Importantly, there is no evidence for decomposition of any of the QBr selected, which indicates that they were stable enough in ZBBs.45 Since then, the four fundamental components of the electrolyte have been identified: zinc salt, the supporting electrolyte, the bromine complexing agent and aqueous solution. Among these components, bromine complexing agents have always been the focus of research.
The separation process of the bromine from the aqueous solution is dependent on the state-of-charge, QBr, bromide ion concentration and composition.44 Vapor pressures of QBr complexes were measured to estimate the release of bromine vapor and the complexing effect.46 Mixtures of QBrs (1:1 mixtures of MEP with either EMM or 2MEP) were used over the temperature range of 0–50 °C to avoid crystallization from either the polybromide or the aqueous phase.16 The complexing agent is generally used in about a 1:3 M ratio to zinc bromine. An electrolyte with mixed QBrs was further developed by Cedzynska using EMM-MEP-2MEP-TBB at a mole ratio of 0.50:0.25:0.15:0.10, which showed lower aqueous bromine concentrations, lower or comparable electrolyte resistivities and smaller values of bromine diffusion coefficients compared with the electrolyte with EMM or EMM-MEP.47
The physicochemical properties of bromine-quaternary ammonium bromide (QBr2n+1) in the electrolyte were characterized using various methods. The interfacial tension and contact angle of oily polybromide complex were measured using the sessile drop method.48 Conway and Donepudi reported direct calorimetric measurements, which eliminates the Joule heating effects, on the reactions of Zn2+/Zn in aqueous Br− solution and the Br2/Br− reaction at Pt in both directions.49 Using vitreous carbon electrodes, the kinetics of the electrochemical processes of the Br2/Br− aqueous system was studied.50 It was also investigated in different aqueous salt (NaBr, ZnBr, NH4Br) solutions using cyclic voltammetry and a rotating disc electrode.92 The potential differences of anodic and cathodic peaks are enlarged with the increasing interaction between bromine and cation, but the exchange current densities decrease to the same extent. Raman spectroscopy is a useful means to investigate the dynamic processes of the bromine complexing phase in ZBFBs, due to its usability in both aqueous and non-aqueous solutions, and its ability to provide information quickly. With the help of Raman spectroscopy, the concentration dependence between quaternary ammonium cations and polybromide anions on the state of charge was studied.51In situ Raman spectroscopy was also employed for the real-time estimation of the state of charge by monitoring the negative electrolyte in ZBFBs and exhibited high accuracy and reproducibility.68 The electrode processes were further investigated using an in situ phase-stabilized electrochemical quartz microbalance and in situ reflection–absorption Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) by Kautek et al.52 They proved that the homogeneous chemical reaction between the dissolved MEP+ cation and bromine forming MEP-Brn is much more rapid than the heterogeneous electrochemical reaction between the adsorbed MEM+ and MEM-Brn. Besides, this group investigated the anodic storage reaction from the perspective of the electrochemical double layer on glassy carbon using in situ reflection–absorption FTIR spectroscopy and small spot X-ray electron emission spectroscopy.53 They further revealed the charging step involving MEM-Brn and MEP-Brn. The use and study of MEP has become the mainstream gradually (Table 1). The change rules of the charge transfer resistance for bromine oxidation and the solution resistance for the catholyte and anolyte with the state of charge were reported by Jeon et al. using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.57 An in operando method using dark-field light microscopy combined with a transparent electrochemical cell was reported to reveal the liquid nature, pinning effect, residual effect, self-discharge, and over-oxidation of polybromide in the native environment, which allow us to have a more visual understanding of the bromine complex.83In situ confocal microscopy was used to directly observe the MEPBr2n+1 droplets by Chung et al., confirming that the droplets are heterogeneously formed via the electrochemical reaction and they would collide back onto the surface of the Pt electrode.67

The electro-oxidation of Br− and electro-reduction of QBr2n+1 in an acidic aqueous solution containing MEP on a Pt ultramicroelectrode (UME) were investigated by Chang et al.70,72,93,94 They found that the electrochemically formed QBr2n+1 diffuses into the aqueous acidic solution as droplets distributed in the vicinity of the electrode. The stochastic current spikes result from the colliding of some QBr2n+1 droplets on Pt UME. All QBr2n+1 droplets should be eventually reduced back to Q+ and Br−. QBr2n+1 undergoes direct and indirect electro-reduction. Their studies revealed the mechanism involving reactions in the positive electrode during the charge and discharge processes in depth. The current amplification of Br−/Br3− in the droplets of MEPBr2n+1 on the UME was investigated using electrochemical methods and simulations, which demonstrated that the rate-determining step of the faradaic reaction of Br−/Br3− is the electron transfer resistance.85
A surface active agent, polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate, was introduced to facilitate catholyte mixing in the MEP-containing electrolyte, which helps effective reduction of bromine during discharge.95 Methanesulfonic acid was used to modify the electrolyte, which could increase the conductivity of the electrolyte, suppress the zinc dendrite growth, and improve the kinetics and reversibility of Zn2+/Zn and Br2/Br−.96
The multifunctional complexing agent, tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPA), allows the high-performance static (non-flow) ZBB to operate using a glass fibre separator, which effectively relieves the bromine diffusion into the anolyte and promotes the non-dendritic growth of zinc electrodeposition.29 Tetrabutylammonium bromide can realize solid-state complexation of Br2/Br3−,78,97 which should better inhibit the diffusion of bromine. To break the temperature upper limit of MEP, 1-ethyl-2-methyl-pyridinium bromide (BCA) was introduced into the ZBFB which can complex with polybromide robustly at high temperature.89 The ZBFB with BCA demonstrated a high energy efficiency of 84% (40 mA cm−2) at the high temperature of 60 °C, and can operate stably for more than 400 cycles. Besides, this kind of ZBFB also works well at room temperature. This work is indeed a step forward in the research of complexing agents.
2.3 Anode
The employment of the zinc plating/stripping processes in ZBBs is a fundamental characteristic, thanks to the merits of low electrochemical potential (−0.76 V), rapid reaction kinetics, low cost, abundance in the earth, high capacity (5854 mA h cm−3 and 820 mA h g−1), excellent stabilities in air and aqueous electrolytes, and environmental friendliness.3,99–102 Based on the reaction of the redox couples in the anolyte and catholyte, ZBFB is classified as a hybrid battery,6,7,103 which is different from the liquid–liquid flow batteries, featuring liquid–liquid redox reactions at both the negative and positive sides, such as the vanadium flow battery, all-iron flow battery, and quinone bromine (ferrocyanide) flow battery. Thus, the independent design of energy and power rating cannot be realized in ZBFBs, since the areal capacity of the zinc anode is limited by the membrane blockage failure, dendritic growth and zinc falling off.104 Even during the later stage of discharge, a higher local current density is inevitable if an overall galvanostatic discharge is to be maintained. The uniform distribution of zinc in the negative electrode is crucial to increase the zinc utilization, maximize the discharge capacity and CE, minimize the dendrite formation and improve the cycling stability of ZBBs.
To optimize the zinc deposition morphology, and thus achieve maximum efficiency and long cycle life of ZBFBs, the deposition during the charging step was widely investigated. Zinc bromide, the primary participant in the electrolyte, is in charge of charge-transfer reactions. Its purity and concentration can obviously affect the morphology of zinc deposition. Suresh et al. presented that the zinc utilization is affected by the electrode substrate material and the purity of zinc bromide in the electrolyte using the carbon felt-free cell. They confirmed that compared with the employment of the carbon–plastic composite electrodes and 98% pure zinc bromide electrolyte, the zinc utilization, as well as the faradaic efficiency, in the ZBFB with non-porous graphite electrodes and 99.9% pure zinc bromide electrolyte increases obviously.60 The concentration of zinc bromide would bring the changes in the nucleation modes. Dense blocky zinc would form in a concentrated electrolyte (≥0.4 M, instantaneous nucleation), while in a dilute electrolyte (≤0.3 M), zinc is mossy controlled by progressive nucleation. The formation of dense blocky zinc during the charging step is necessary to maintain a relative high CE, that is to say, the concentration of zinc bromide should be maintained at more than 0.4 M.105 It is interesting that optimized electrolyte utilization was proposed from the aspect of zinc deposition morphology, which can provide reference for better control of zinc deposition in the future.
The influence of chloride-based supporting electrolyte on zinc morphology was studied by Anthony et al.74 When the plated zinc is exposed to the chloride-containing electrolyte for a period of time, its morphology and preferred crystal orientation can change. The binding of Cl leads to zinc surface buckling and reduces surface uniformity. This finding enlightens us that the relationship between the supporting electrolyte and the morphology of the zinc electrochemical deposition layer cannot be ignored.
A bromine complexing agent is usually added to the electrolyte to suppress self-discharge and bromine corrosion. Therefore, the role that a bromine complexing agent plays in the behaviour of zinc deposition deserves to pay attention. It has been confirmed that MEP, the most commonly used bromine complexing agent in ZBBs, has strong effects on the formation of a uniformly flat zinc deposition layer and the suppression of zinc dendrite growth, through the electrostatic shield of 1-ethyl-1-methyl-pyrrolidinium cations in and around the tip of zinc dendrite (Fig. 2a).79 Other five QBrs as well as MEP, which are ionic liquid and potentially alternatively used for complexing bromine, including 1-ethyl-1-methylpiperidinium, 1-ethyl-1-methylimidazolium bromide, 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium bromide, 1-ethylpyridinium bromide and 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-pyridinium bromide, were also employed to investigate their influence on zinc half-cell.106 The addition of 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium bromide, 1-ethylpyridinium bromide and 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-pyridinium bromide is beneficial for the compactness of Zn deposits. Thanks to the lower diffusion limitation and less charge-transfer resistance, the electrolyte with 1-ethylpyridinium bromide displays a lower polarization resistance and shows higher exchange currents, compared with the other five quaternary ammonium bromine compounds (including MEP). It has been confirmed that increasing the complexing agent in the electrolyte could reduce the formation of zinc dendrites during the charging step.79 In addition, a functionalized additive has been investigated and used to inhibit the formation of zinc dendrites. The ZBFB with Cr3+ additive can improve the compactness of zinc deposits, and present higher average CE and the increase in the pH of the electrolyte has been suppressed, which is also attributed to electrostatic shielding from Cr3+.76 During charging in ZBFBs, a dense nonaqueous polybromide phase forms in the catholyte, leading to inhomogeneous two phases flowing in/on the electrode. The uneven redox kinetics from the Br2/Br− couple was accompanied by the nonuniform zinc plating/stripping and dendrite formation. Therefore, it is the prerequisite to ensure an excellent cyclic stability that the high enough rate of electrolyte circulation should maintain so that polybromide phase can be better dispersed.66
 Fig. 2  Schematic representation of different strategies for uniform zinc deposition: (a) dendrite growth in the case of pristine and electrostatic shielding MEP+,79 (b) uniform zinc nucleation and lateral growth on the defective carbon layer-coated carbon felt98 and (c) Sn induction zinc deposition mechanism.86 
Three-dimensional carbon-based materials, such as graphite felt and carbon felt, are commonly employed as negative electrodes in ZBFBs, due to their large specific surface area, high porosity and good chemical/electrochemical stability. Therefore, zinc deposits not only on the electrode surface, but also inside its pores, which is beneficial for suppressing the fast growth of zinc dendrites. To further improve the unform distribution of zinc, Zhao et al. employed the first-principles to study the zinc adsorption and diffusion on the carbon surface to illustrate the underlying zinc anchoring effect of single vacancy.75 In addition, the proposed mechanism was validated by achieving a more uniform zinc deposition using a graphite felt negative electrode with a high content of carbon defects in ZBFBs. This work opens a new path to induce uniform distribution of zinc. The pyrolytic method was used to improve the electrochemical properties of carbon felt and then promote uniform zinc deposition.107 Compared with the pristine carbon felt, the pyrolytic carbon felt showed improved zinc deposition morphology, and higher CE and EE. Subsequently, the deeper understanding of the influence of single vacancy carbon defect on zinc deposition was studied by Ju-Hyuk Lee et al. using DFT calculations and electrochemical analysis (Fig. 2b).98 They demonstrated that single vacancy carbon defect can prevent the aggregative zinc growth by preventing the surface diffusion of zinc. The strong orbital hybridization between zinc and bonds of the defect is formed. The defective carbon layer on a 3D felt electrode was achieved by carbonizing a ZIF-8. In addition, a tin layer was also introduced and deposited onto the surface of carbon felt to induce the uniform electrochemical deposition of zinc (Fig. 2c).86 With the help of the robust zinc nucleation sites, low hydrogen evolution reaction potential and low zinc nucleation overpotential offered by tin layer, the ZBFB displayed a long cycle life and high CE. It is inferred that the properties of the surface of substrate materials cannot be ignored, when we consider how to solve the zinc dendrite problem.
2.4 Cathode
Developing high efficiency adsorption and high activity cathode materials is an efficient method to increase CE, EE and operating current density. To slower the diffusion of bromine to the zinc anode, the cell had to be placed horizontally. However, it can be operated vertically if the positive electrode is covered with an immobilized sorbent to hold the bromine.10 Charcoal10 and monolithic megaloporous carbon cryogels108 were studied and employed only as the sorbent or container for bromine. The reversible storage of the Br2/Br− redox couple in a conducting polymer (pyrrole black) matrix has been studied, demonstrating that the cell with it showed a higher open circuit voltage depending on the state of charge. The authors proposed that the origin of self-discharge is oxidative bromination and depolymerization of polypyrrole.109
In the past few decades, graphite felts or carbon felts were used as electrodes on both sides to lower polarization and the substrate supporting the functional materials, thanks to their high chemical stability, high specific surface area and excellent electrical conductivity.20,24,55,75 The associated investigations have demonstrated that graphite felt electrodes with thermal or plasma treatment and rayon-based carbon felts can effectively improve the performance of ZBFBs.41,75,84
Encouraged by the gradual improvement of the performance of ZBBs, the electrocatalytic activity to Br2/Br− redox reaction came into the view of the researchers, which was consider as an important point to reduce cell electrochemical polarization and enhance power density.63 The relationship between activity and structure of carbon materials for the redox reaction of Br2/Br− was illustrated by Zhang et al.63 They showed that the carbon material with high surface area, outstanding electrical conductivity and proper pore size distribution provides high activity to the Br2/Br− redox couple. Whereafter, they proposed a bimodal highly ordered mesostructure carbon with attractive activity (Fig. 3a).64 The ZBFBs using this designed carbon demonstrated a high voltage efficiency (VE, 82.9%) and EE (80.1%) at a current density of 80 mA cm−2. Besides, they further designed a cage-like carbon with a specific pore structure possessing superhigh activity and Br2-complex-entrapping capability to be used as a cathode material for bromine-based flow batteries (Fig. 3b).71 The pore size of the cage-like carbon between the size of Br− and the bromine complex can effectively entrap the bromine complex by pore size exclusion. This impressive design increased the performance of ZBFBs to a higher level (CE of 98% and EE of 81% at a current density of 80 mA cm−2). The research team further tried to use the TiN nanorod array as the electrocatalyst for Br2/Br− redox reaction, showing excellent performance of the ZBFBs (Fig. 3c).23 A protonated pyridinic nitrogen doped microporous carbon decorated on graphite felt, which is able to convert bromine to the polybromide anion, was proposed by Lim et al. to capture the bromine and polybromide anions in membraneless and flowless zinc–bromine batteries (Fig. 3d).28 An extraordinary cyclic stability over 1000 cycles (EE > 80%) was obtained using this tailored cathode material. In addition, carbon nanotubes,55,58 active carbon,56 carbon black,63 carbonized tubular polypyrrole,110 N-doped carbon,111 N-doped porous nano-sheet carbon,112 low-dimensional N-doped carbon,113 halogenated graphene,65 reduced graphene oxide,81 N-doped graphene nanoplatelets114 and boron-doped graphene82 have been investigated to enhance the reaction kinetics of Br2/Br−. Amorphous metal oxides (WOx, ZrOx, TiOx and AlOx) were used to coat carbon electrodes to improve the rate capability and VE of ZBFBs, which take advantage of their aid role in adsorbing the bromine complex.77 Acetylene black modified MnO2 was prepared and served as a catalyst, showing outstanding electrochemical activity for Br2/Br−.31

An activated carbon derived from Phyllanthus emblica leaf biomass and mesoporous carbon derived from pomelo peel were reported as electrocatalysts to enhance the electrochemical reaction of the Br-species.80,115 The usage of biomass derived materials for energy storage and conversion applications possesses a broad application prospect.
Taking the stack integration for large-scale application into consideration, the bipolar plate is a key component. The surface transport properties of the carbon plastic electrodes of 15% carbon nanotube-high density polyethylene and 19% carbon black-high density polyethylene were studied, showing that an increased electroactive surface area and a lower electron transfer resistance could be achieved through the improved dispersion of carbon nanotubes in the composite electrode.59 The electrical conductivity, mechanical properties and charge–discharge performance of composite bipolar plate consisting of polypropylene, carbon black, graphite and carbon nanotubes were tested in the ZBFBs by Park et al. to optimize the amount of carbon nanotubes.61 They demonstrated that the carbon plastic plate with 5 wt% carbon nanotubes endowed the cell stack with a high VE and EE.
2.5 Membrane
Membrane is the key component in ZBBs, which determines the cyclic stability, CE, EE and self-discharge performance. The basic function of a membrane is to avoid contact between the cathode and anode, provide an ion transport path, and suppress bromine diffusion to anode. The outstanding membrane, therefore, should possesses many properties, including superior chemical/mechanical stability, noticeable corrosion resistance, high ion-conductivity, superb bromine resistance capability, and low cost, at the same time.
Nafion membrane, a dense cation exchange membrane, has been widely applied to investigate ZBBs, thanks to its excellent chemical stability.6,8,104,116 Because of the preferential cation transport, Nafion membrane displays a high area specific resistance. To improve its ionic conductivity and enable it with fast bi-ionic transport of Zn2+ and Br−, the water cluster size of Nafion is enlarged properly by a pre-hydration treatment (Fig. 4a).73 Compared with the conventional porous membrane (SF600) and pristine Nafion membrane, the efficiencies, including CE and EE, of ZBFBs were significantly increased. However, the use of expensive Nafion membrane inevitably leads to a high capital cost of the stack systems, clogging its further commercial application for large-scale energy storage. An advanced strategy for the efficient and low-cost use of Nafion membrane is of great significance. To this end, a void-free Nafion/porous polypropylene (PP) membrane is proposed and fabricated by Kim et al.69 The Nafion solution using NMP as the solvent was impregnated in the pores of the PP separator (Fig. 4b). Compared with the commercial SF600 porous membrane (Asahi Kasei), the Nafion/PP membrane presents a smaller area specific resistance and better Br2 resistance. The K+-conducting membrane can be prepared by further treating the Nafion membrane, which was used to segregate neutral–alkaline hybrid electrolytes.31 By the way, referring to other similar battery systems, the valuable inspirational ideas must be found. For instance, polyvinylidene fluoride-bound carbon was infiltrated into the Nafion membrane, forming a charge-reinforced ion-selective membrane, to absorb the polysulfide anions and the polyiodide anions on the negative and positive sides of the membrane, respectively, in polysulfide-based redox batteries.117 The charged anions can be trapped and accumulated, which can effectively reduce the cross-over of active materials by the electrostatic repulsion of adsorbed anions to active anions in the electrolyte. As a result, an extremely low capacity decay rate (0.0004% per cycle) can be obtained even in the polysulfide/polyiodide static cell. This strategy is of great benefit to solving the problem of self-discharge in ZBBs.

A microporous polyethylene membrane with hydrophilic treatment (Daramic and SF600), which owns the features of low cost and has reasonable chemical stability, is widely used in ZBFBs.29,63,65,69,73,77,104 However, the porous structure of these membranes cannot completely block the Br2 crossover, and has a low bromine blocking capability, compared to Nafion membranes. A comparison of Nafion 115 and Daramic membrane was carried out in ZBFBs.20 It can be found that Nafion 115, possessing excellent bromine resistance due to its dense structure, displays a higher CE by 15%; while the ionic conductivity of Daramic endows it with a higher VE by 12%.69 To be honest, which one is better cannot be figured out clearly, and should depend on the specific application and demand. Furthermore, the structural design and composite modification endow the porous membrane with additional functionality beyond intrinsic and traditional role. An activated carbon coated porous membrane was designed to increase the reaction rate of the rate-determined step, promote the formation of Brads and thus decrease the internal resistance.56 Due to the presence of a high electrochemical activity layer close to the porous membrane, the EE and working current density could be increased significantly. Moreover, to relieve the self-discharge and irreversible capacity decay from the diffusion of bromine species, the modification of the Daramic membrane should be a superior strategy. The Daramic membrane decorated with a complexing agent-containing highly selective functional layer was proposed and used in ZBFBs with single flow circuit, which takes full advantage of the high selectivity from complexation with the diffused bromine from MEP-Br.118 The cell with this membrane demonstrates a higher capacity retention rate (69.3%, 24 h rest), compared to that with the pristine Daramic membrane (35.7%).
3. Summary and perspectives
ZBBs are considered as one of the most promising technologies for stationary energy storage. Although noteworthy advancements in science and technology have been achieved, there are still some obstacles to overcome to further accelerate the commercialization process. The cyclic stability, capacity retention, EE and power density should be further improved. In the future, efforts still need to be made in the following areas (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Proposed strategies for the performance improvement of ZBBs. 
3.1 Fabricating optimized battery structure
To date, the structures of ZBBs can be divided into four categories: static ZBB (Fig. 1a), ZBFB with double flow circuits (Fig. 1b), ZBFBs with single flow circuit (Fig. 1c) and membrane-free ZBB (Fig. 1d). Each structure has its own merits, but there are also disadvantages. From a practical point of view, it is difficult to meet the extensive market requirements only by relying on the strongth in one specific aspect. In other words, their special application scenarios should be found, or all problems must be solved. A competitive ZBB product should closely fit its application and possess low cost, high safety, long cycle life, high energy density, simple structure, excellent maintainability and outstanding environmental suitability. Therefore, structural optimization still needs to continue. On the other hand, an innovative structure should be conceived and fabricated to further investigate the fundamental problems in ZBBs or endow ZBBs with overwhelming strength compared with other energy storage devices for specific applications. In addition, we should try whether some of the thorny problems, such as dendritic growth, limited areal capacity, low energy density and so on, can be solved by structural design. A promising advanced structure of ZBBs would motivate the research and development of other key components, including membrane, electrode and electrolyte.
3.2 Proposing-high performance additives
The additives mentioned here are the general term for complexing agents and other functional additives, which in electrolyte can remarkably affect the cell performances of ZBBs. Additives can work in three ways: (1) altering the complexing state of polybromide, (2) affecting the deposition morphology of zinc, and (3) changing the properties of electrolyte. Specifically, firstly, an advanced additive has either a suitable complexing ability with polybromide or a moderate affinity with polybromide complex, which enables a ZBB to possess both high CE and high VE at a relatively high current density. Secondly, an advanced additive can optimize the morphology of electrochemical zinc deposition layer so that the zinc on the anode can cycle with high reversibility, high areal capacity and dendrite-free morphology. Thirdly, the ion conductivity, kinetics, and high and low temperature tolerance of the electrolyte in ZBBs should be affected by additives. Therefore, it is a meaningful direction to develop a novel high-performance additive, which can solve as many key problems as possible and then enhance the competitive power of ZBBs. From the current state of the art, the application of quaternary ammonium salts demonstrates obvious merits, or to say that it is necessary to some extent. Proposing novel quaternary ammonium salts or functionalized existing quaternary ammonium salts would get twice the result with half the effort. In addition, other types of additives, which can perform an auxiliary role for enhancing or compensating the function of a complexing agent, are worthy of extensive study.
3.3 Enhancing anode with high areal capacity and dendrite-free zinc deposition
The electrically conductive anodes in ZBBs play the main role of loading or accommodating electrochemically generated zinc during charging. However, the ununiform deposition and dendrite growth of zinc on the anode severely affect the cyclic stability and CE during the charging and discharge processes, and the larger the areal capacity, the more serious the impact. Therefore, in general, the allowable areal capacity in ZBBs is not high enough to ensure excellent cycle life and high efficiency. To improve the energy density and decrease the cost of the ZBB energy storage system, higher areal capacity based on dendrite-free deposition of zinc is necessary. The following strategies need to be considered: (1) functionalized surface of anode should be further optimized to induce uniform deposition of zinc; (2) the advanced structure of anode is worth being designed to provide plenty of attachment site and space to store zinc; and (3) noncarbon innovative anode materials may be better to relieve the problems of zinc deposition.
3.4 Preparing highly active cathode with a tailored structure
To increase the operating current density of ZBBs, the electrochemical reaction rate of Br2/Br− needs to be improved by the cathode. On the one hand, an ideal active cathode material should possess high selectivity in catalysing the reaction of Br2/Br−, high efficiency, and high electrical conductivity and durability. It is worth noting that the possible parasitic reaction of oxygen evolution and complexing agent decomposition must be avoided. On the other hand, the cathode should have an advanced structure with a high specific surface area and a high efficiency mass transfer channel. ZBB is characterized by the formation of an oil phase consisting of polybromide and the complexing agent during charging. Possibly, the surface properties and dispersion of the oil phase should be taken into consideration when an advanced cathode is designed. However, the mechanism of catalytic reaction of Br2/Br− should be further investigated using the experiments combined with theoretical calculations, which would promote the research and development of high-performance cathode materials.
3.5 Designing and synthesizing advanced membrane materials
The membrane in ZBBs should have the following basic functions: insulating between the anode and cathode, providing ionic conduction, restraining polybromide crossover, and preventing zinc dendrite penetration. The self-discharge, efficiency and cyclic stability of ZBBs are controlled by the properties of the membrane. An excellent mechanical and chemical stability is a necessary prerequisite to resist dendrite growth of zinc and corrosion of bromine. In addition, the membrane has to possess both a high ionic conductivity and good resistance to polybromide crossover. However, how to balance them is still a question. Therefore, novel membrane materials should be developed to meet most of the needs. Besides, a composite membrane, which can be a combination of advantages of some membrane materials, should be further developed.
The success of ZBBs requires systematic science and engineering approaches, and depends on the progress in all aspects. Systematic analysis, optimization and cost accounting are necessary to identify the principal contradiction, lock the research direction and evaluate the beneficial effect. Although the prospect of the large-scale application of ZBBs is promising, more efforts are still needed to solve some key problems and further improve their performance.
This perspective summarizes the development of ZBBs from the aspects of the structure, electrolyte, anode, cathode and membrane, and provides our perspectives on their further advancement. We believe that with the unremitting efforts from the scientists all over the world and the progress of advanced technology and materials, ZBBs will be used in energy storage facilities on a large scale.
