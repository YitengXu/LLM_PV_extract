    , Accepted 8th July 2004First published on 10th August 2004AbstractA modified-templated-hydrothermal technique was used to prepare mesoporous titania powders through the interaction of tiny anatase seeds (<5 nm) with block-copolymer Pluronic P123 in the presence (acidic route) and absence of HCl (neutral route). The calcined neutral powders featured a full anatase crystalline domain with high surface area (106.0 m2 g−1) and large pore sizes (8.0 nm). Meanwhile, the acidic route produced higher surface area (156.7 m2 g−1), larger pores (9.7 nm) and a mixture of anatase and rutile crystalline phases. The neutral route derived titania films showed higher DSSC performance up to a global efficiency of 5% using N3-ruthenium complex dye.
Introduction
Titania has been the focus of a large concerted research effort owing to its diverse potential applications from water purification1 to photoelectrical solar cells.2 The current benchmark of dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) derived from nanostructured titania is a 10.4% global efficiency3 employing the chemisorption of the ‘black dye’ ruthenium complex. Although the optimisation of the most efficient dyes to increase the optical absorption and charge injection has been attained, efforts to modify titania as the most efficient dye support have been limited and generally overlooked.4,5
Recently, researchers6,7 reported a high interest in mesoporous titania with long-range ordered mesophases due to their high order pore geometries with tuneable structure via altering the synthesis parameters. However, attempts to incorporate them into DSSCs have not been revealed, which can be directed linked to the resultant titania's small pore sizes. In this situation, the Ru-complex dye adsorption and the electrolyte solution percolation are limited due to pore blocking. Therefore, in this work we report on a novel synthesis route, which comprises anatase seeds assembling via a hydrothermal process using block-copolymer surfactants to obtain large mesoporous and crystalline titania. This synthesis route is inspired by the concept of auto-assembly of zeolite seeds into mesoporous aluminosilicate.8 In our route, anatase seeds (crystal size < 5 nm) obtained under neutral and acidic conditions were subsequently interacted with neutral and acidic aqueous block-copolymer solutions to obtain the desired highly mesostructured titania powders. The neutral anatase seed–neutral template interaction is denoted as the neutral route, and the acidic anatase seed–acidic template interaction as the acidic route. Detailed anatase seeds preparation and characterisation have been discussed elsewhere.9
In this paper, the structural characteristics and the DSSC performance of the titania photoanodes produced from the resultant powders of these 2 routes are compared and discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this paper reports the first appreciable DSSC response obtained from a mesoporous titania photoanode which has mesophase and mesostructural order.
Experimental methods
Preparation of mesoporous titania powders
This synthesis route involved 2 steps, namely anatase seed preparation and seed-templating. In the first step, 5 mL of titanium isopropoxide (Ti(OPri)4, 97%, Aldrich) as the titanium source was diluted with 8.3 mL of ethanol absolute (EtOH) and hydrolysed without (neutral route) and with addition of HCl (acidic route) under constant stirring for 2 h at room temperature. Hydrolysis was performed by adding the ethanolic titanium solution dropwise into a mixture of 6.67 mL of distilled water and 1.67 mL of EtOH. Concentrated HCl (32%) was used to obtain high acidity. The precursors chemical compositions are 1Ti(OPri)4 : 10.55EtOH : 90.95H2O and 1Ti(OPri)4 : 10.55EtOH : 90. 95H2O : 0.3HCl for neutral and acidic routes, respectively. The resultant suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave for thermal treatment at 80 °C for 4 h. The block copolymer Pluronic P123, designated as EO20PO70EO20, was used as received from BASF as the template for the second hydrothermal step. In the acidic route, 4 mL of HCl (32%) was added to the aqueous solution of 3.2 g of template in 40 mL of distilled water. The first hydrothermal process was quenched directly after 4 h. The warm suspension was added dropwise into the template solution for 1 h at 40–50 °C under stirring. This step was carried out to ensure homogeneous mixing of the seed suspension and template solution. Then, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave for thermal treatment at 100 °C for 20 h and 40 h, for the neutral and acidic routes, respectively. The resultant powders were recovered by using vacuum filtration or evaporation at 60 °C before being subjected to calcination in a muffle furnace at 400 °C (ramping rate 1 °C min−1) for 4 h. The Pluronic template was completely removed after calcination.
The calcined powders were characterised by using low-angle and wide-angle XRD to determine the mesostructure order and crystalline phases, respectively. A Bruker Advanced D4 XRD with parallel beam optic configuration was used for low-angle analysis, while a Bruker D4 XRD with a Bragg–Bentano configuration was used for the wide-angle analysis. Both analyses used Cu Kα radiation (λ
					= 0.1546 nm). The resultant wide-angle XRD patterns were fitted to the PDF (Powder Diffraction Files) of the JCPDS (Joint Committee on Powders Diffraction Standards) mineral database of anatase, rutile and brookite (PDF No 21-1272, 21-1276, 29-1360, respectively). N2 adsorption–desorption analysis was performed by using an Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome) at −196 °C in a liquid nitrogen bath. Samples were outgassed under reduced pressure prior analysis for 4 h at 200 °C. The specific surface area and the pore size distribution were determined by BET and BJH models, respectively. TEM analysis was carried out on the calcined powders by using an FEI Tecnai-20 200kV TEM. The powders were ground in acetone, and a drop was dispersed on a carbon-coated Cu grid for examination.
Preparation of mesoporous titania photoanodes
A doctor-blading(slip-cast) technique was used to prepare the titania films on a TEC-8 (Hartford Glass, F-doped tin oxide with sheet resistance of 8 Ω m−2) glass substrates. Both of the titania powders produced by the neutral and acidic routes were used to make the slurries for titania photoanodes. The slurries were made of the composition of 1 g of calcined mesoporous TiO2 powder, 2 mL distilled water, 5 drops of Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 drops of acetylacetone (Sigma-Aldrich). The titania slurries were sheared across the glass substrate with a glass rod resulting in electrodes of 0.25 cm2, which were subsequently calcined at 450 °C for 5 minutes. Repetitive coating was carried out as the first sintered electrodes cooled down to room temperature by repeating the above procedure. The final film deposition was followed by calcination at 450 °C for 30 minutes
DSSC testing

Working electrode. 
Prior to dye adsorption, the titania photoanodes were calcined at 450 °C for 15 minutes and cooled under nitrogen to 80–100 °C and then placed into the dye solution (0.3 mM N3, a Ru-“red-dye”, in 1 : 1 acetonitrile : 1-butanol) for 18 hours. Upon removal from dye solution the electrodes were washed thoroughly in acetonitrile.


Cell assembling. 
A Surlyn™
						(Dupont) gasket of 200 micron thickness was cut to fit around the 0.25 cm2 electrodes, placed on the counter electrode and subsequently heated to 100 °C. To seal the solar cell, the working electrodes were sandwiched onto the counter electrodes. The electrolyte 0.5 M LiI (Lancaster), 0.04 M I2
						(Lancaster) and 0.05 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (Aldrich) in acetonitrile was then administered through a hole in the counter electrode and sealed at 80 °C with a Surlyn-coated microscope cover glass slide.


White-light testing. 
The photocurrent versus voltage (I–V) curves were determined under AM1.5 direct illumination, provided by a Thermo Oriel Xenon lamp fitted with AM1.5D filters. Incident power densities of 100 mW cm−2 were obtained by using a Spectra Physics 407A power meter as a reference. Labview software was used to drive a Keithley 2400 source meter and to record the current across a linear voltage sweep from −0.5 to 0.8 V across an active area of 0.25 cm2 of the sandwiched cells. Efficiencies were calculated by equation (1) where η is the global efficiency, (I
						×
						V)max is the maximum power, FF is the fill factor and Pinput is the power of the incident light. (1)


Incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) testing. 
Photocurrent action spectra were obtained by coupling the output of the Thermo Oriel source into a Yvon Jobin HRS2 monochromator. The monochromator was calibrated against the NIST standard for Xe, and the source was operated for at least one hour prior to testing to ensure thermal stability. The output of the monochromator was alternately coupled onto the device under test and onto a calibrated silicon photodiode (Newport 818-UV) in order to obtain the quantum efficiency as a function of wavelength.

Results and discussion
Characterisation of mesoporous titania powders

Fig. 1 shows the low-angle XRD patterns of the calcined powders of mesoporous titania. The observed single-peak pattern implies the presence of a short-range ordered mesophase, which is mostly assigned to the formation of a disordered hexagonal10 or worm-hole mesopore structure.11 Neutral route powders resulted in a single peak at 1.5° 2θ
					(d
					= 5.88 nm), and acidic route powders at 1.8° 2θ
					(d
					= 4.90 nm). The relatively broad, but defined, peak obtained for the acidic route powders inferred their broad pore size distribution but higher mesoporosity compared with the neutral route derived mesoporous titania powders. This is confirmed by the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribution (Fig. 2). The structural characteristics obtained from the XRD and the N2 adsorption–desorption analysis are summarised in Table 1.

In addition, the wide-angle XRD spectra (Fig. 1) confirmed the type of crystalline phases present in the resultant powders. It can be seen that the neutral route generates anatase (A) phase with a minor contribution of brookite (B). On the other hand, in the acidic route, protonation to the surface of anatase seeds is likely to cause partial blocking to the anatase growth, therefore lowering the activation energy for the rutile and brookite formation. The wide-angle XRD pattern of acidic route powders presented a mixture of crystalline phases of anatase (A), rutile (R) and brookite (B). These trends are in line with work reported on anatase to rutile transformation under acidic thermal treatment.12
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and pore size distribution of calcined mesoporous titania are shown in Fig. 2. In both cases, type IV isotherms are observed. It is generally accepted that this type of isotherm will only appear in a powder possessing pores ranging from tens to hundreds of Angstroms, typical of mesoporous solids.13 From the isotherms, it can be seen that the monolayer adsorption is not complete until reaching a relative pressure of 0.6, where the loop opens, indicating the existence of large mesopores. No tailing upward at higher relative pressure shows the formation of long-range order mesoporosity without any contribution of large pores beyond mesopore scale (>50 nm). The BJH model of the pore size distribution from the desorption branch of the isotherms indicates the presence of narrow pore size distribution with FWHM (Full Width at Half Maximum) of 1.78 nm and 2.67 nm, for neutral route and acidic route powders, respectively.
It can also be seen from Table 1 that the acidic route results in a larger pore size with higher porosity and surface area. This is likely due to the formation of smaller and less aggregated particles in the acidic route, as demonstrated by the TEM images (Fig. 3). However, this highly dispersed system induces a slightly broader pore size distribution (the FWHM is about 2 times higher). In this case, the pores presumably originate from the spaces previously occupied by the template assemblies. The block copolymer micelles are forming coated layer over the anatase seeds. The strength of micelle–micelle interactions in acidic solution resulted in larger micelle aggregates and therefore a thicker coating layer. Thus, larger pores are formed. Uncontrollable micelle aggregation resulted in inhomogeneous aggregate size, thus presenting pore size distribution broadening.

Despite the lack of long-range mesophase pores, these materials possess a single-mode pore size distibution owing to the template-pore forming mechanism. This result is in line with work reported by Kriesel et al.14 and Devi et al..15
The TEM images (Fig. 3) show the existence of interstitial pores with irregular pore structure. The formation of almost spherical nanocrystals is also clearly indicated by the shape of the bright spots in the dark-field TEM images. Less aggregated particles are observed for acidic route titania powders due to thicker coated layers of micelles over the anatase seeds.
Compared to some previous work in the area of mesoporous titania syntheses, this synthesis route has produced materials with better mesoporosity and high surface area. Most of the researchers showed type IV isotherms with bimodal pores of meso- and macropores (indicated by the presence of two hysteresis loops and/or tailing upward at higher relative pressure) or a wide pore size distribution.7,16 Zheng et al.17,18 reported comparable isotherms, which were only obtainable after calcination at 500 °C, thus featuring a low surface area of 65 m2 g−1 and a smaller pore diameter of ∼5.5 nm.18 Therefore, it can be concluded that the anatase seed-templated-hydrothermal technique provided a facile route to obtain a highly ordered mesostructured titania powder with large pore sizes and desired crystalline phases.
Performance of mesoporous titania films for DSSCs
Comparing the performance of acid and neutral route derived photoanodes, a higher efficiency was achieved for the latter photoanode (Fig. 4A). Higher Voc and Jsc were responsible for this increased performance, which may be caused by the presence of the full anatase domain characteristic of the powder precursor as previously demonstrated (Fig. 1). It can also be seen from the dark-current curves shown in Fig. 4B, that the breakdown voltage is higher for the neutral route derived cell, indicating the slower rate of possible interfacial recombination of the injected electrons from the conduction band of the titania semiconductor interface, which is important to obtain better DSSC performance. This feature also contributes to higher VOC

Fig. 5 shows the incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of neutral route and acidic route derived photoanodes. The responses are uncorrected for the absorption and scattering of incident light by the glass substrates. Reasonable response peaks at ∼520 nm were observed, indicating the sensitising work of the red dye (N3) to the titania photoanode, in accordance with some previous works.4,19 The photoaction spectra (IPCE versus wavelength curve) obtained are greatly affected by the titania film morphology. Tesfamichael et al.20 showed that there is an optimum dyeing time. Since mesoporous titania has significantly different textural characteristics to non-mesoporous material, such as titania P25 (Degussa), it is predicted that the dye adsorption behaviour is also significantly different.

A closer look at the intensity of the 520 nm peak relative to the small strong peak due to the titania response at the threshold of the UV-Visible region in Fig. 5A, has revealed that the former peak for the mesoporous titania is lower than that of the latter peak. This indicates that the dye adsorption in those particular mesoporous titania powders has not reached the optimum. The possibility to obtain higher DSSC performance exists by optimising the dye-adsorption capability of the neutral route derived powder, which merits further study.
Such low IPCE values observed for these cells (∼15% at the MLCT maximum) resulted from the lower testing cells performance during IPCE testing, which was carried out one day after white-light testing. Therefore, to diminish differences due to cell assembling performance and for ease of evaluation, the photoaction spectra were normalized to a common IPCE value of 1 at their maximum at 520 nm, as shown in Fig. 5B. It can be seen that the neutral route mesoporous titania has slightly higher response in the red wavelength region than that of the acid route derived mesoporous titania. This can be attributed to the difference in the crystalline phase composition, which affects the diffusion rate of the electron transport. The presence of rutile results in a lower diffusion rate of the injected electrons to transport throughout the titania layers to the back contact, therefore lowering the current generation. It has been reported21 that single crystalline phase titania performs better than a mixture.
Conclusion
A novel approach to synthesise mesostructured crystalline titania with short-range ordered pore structure, high mesoporosity, surface area and large pores has been demonstrated via interacting anatase seeds hydrothermally with a template solution of block copolymer Pluronic P123 in neutral and acidic media. The acidic route produced higher mesoporosity, surface area and larger pore materials with particle characteristics of anatase, rutile and brookite. On the other hand, the neutral route resulted in lower structural characteristics, but produced anatase phase with minor contribution of brookite.
Efforts to incorporate the resultant derived powders as photoanodes in DSSCs resulted in variable performance dependent on the titania surface morphology and structural characteristics. It was shown that the neutral route with characteristics of anatase and minor brookite performed better than the acid-treated acidic route derived photoanodes.
