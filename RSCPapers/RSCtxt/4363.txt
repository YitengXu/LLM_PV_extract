    , Accepted 9th May 2012First published on 12th June 2012AbstractThe introduction of a secondary phase is an efficient and effective way to improve the electrochemical performance of graphene towards energy storage applications. Two fundamental strategies including pre-graphenization and post-graphenization were widely employed for graphene-based hybrids. However, there is still an open question of which way is better. In this contribution, we investigated the differences in the structure and electrochemical properties of pre- and post-graphenized graphene–SnO2 hybrids. The pre-graphenization is realized by synthesis of thermally reduced graphene and subsequent impregnation of SnO2, while the post-graphenization is realized by introducing a Sn-containing phase onto GO sheets followed by chemical reduction. The pre-graphenization process provides a large amount of pores for ion diffusion, which is of benefit for loading of SnO2, fast ion diffusion for supercapacitors, and higher capacity for Li-ion batteries, but poor stability, while the post-graphenization process offers compact graphene and good interaction between the SnO2 and graphene, which provides stable structure for long term stability for supercapacitor and Li-ion battery use.
1. Introduction
Advanced energy storage and conversion is an important issue for a sustainable development of our society. Electrochemical energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and batteries, are playing a core role in balancing the energy generated by engines, solar and wind power. Supercapacitors, or electrochemical capacitors, are energy storage devices that store charges electrostatically through the reversible adsorption/desorption of ions in the electrolyte onto active materials,1,2 while Li-ion batteries, which consist of two electrodes that are capable of reversibly hosting Li in ionic form,3 are widely used for consumer electronics, power management, and hybrid electric vehicles. However, the energy density or power density of the two systems still needs to be improved for demanding applications. Exploring advanced electrode materials is one of the most straightforward approaches to improve the efficiency of electrochemical energy storage systems.
The element carbon is a very flexible choice for building electrochemical energy storage devices.4 Graphite, hard carbon, glassy carbon, carbon black, mesocarbon microbead, activated carbon, and mesoporous carbon have been widely utilized in various energy storage systems.5 Carbon nanotubes have been applied as an electric conductive additive for Li-ion batteries.6 Graphene, the two-dimensional carbon crystal lattice with excellent electronic conductivity, optical transparency, mechanical strength, inherent flexibility, and huge theoretical surface area, has been considered a novel and portable nano-carbon component for electrodes of energy storage devices.7–9 However, the irreversible aggregation of graphene sheets always creates more void units and masks active sites for pseudo-capacitor or Li-intercalation. Thus, metal oxides (e.g. RuO2,10 MnO2,2,11 Co3O4,12 NiO,13 SnO2,14–16 Fe3O4 (ref. 17)), conductive polymers (e.g. PANI,18 PPy19) or nanocarbon (e.g. carbon nanotube20) are introduced as secondary phases that serve as “spacers” to avoid the re-stacking of graphene, provide pseudo-active centres for supercapacitors, or host storage materials for Li-ion batteries. The synergistic effects between graphene and the secondary phase such as space confinement, electronic modification, and fast charge transfer will also enhance the electrochemical performance of the electrode materials. The applications of graphene-based electrodes for supercapacitor and Li-ion battery use are also highlighted by recent reviews.8
To develop graphene-based hybrid electrodes with superior performance in electrochemical energy storage, the selection of appropriate raw materials and the optimization of synthesis strategy are of great importance. Among various approaches for graphene production, the chemically derived graphene (CDG), which uses graphite, graphite oxide (GO) or other graphite derivatives as starting materials, can be produced in large scale, and provides further processability and abundant functions for industrial applications as well.7,8 Up to now, the reduction of GO to CDGs is the most widely applied technique for the large scale preparation of graphene. During the preparation of graphene-based hybrids, as shown in Fig. 1, the current reported methods can be simply classified into two general strategies according to the processes of CDG synthesis: (1) pre-graphenization strategy: CDG is synthesized (such as thermally reduced graphene (TRG)) before the second component is introduced; (2) post-graphenization strategy: a composite composed of a CDG precursor (usually graphene oxide) and the second component is pre-prepared, followed by converting the precursor into chemical reduced graphene (CRG). Both of them have been widely used for graphene-based hybrid electrode fabrication, but it is still an open question as to which one is better.
 Fig. 1  Illustration of the pre- and post-graphenization route for metal oxide–graphene hybrid fabrication. 
To explore an advanced technique as well as reveal the chemical and material science for fabrication of graphene-based electrode materials, SnO2, which is an important n-type semiconductor with a wide band gap (Eg = 3.6 eV) for many applications such as gas sensors, supercapacitors, and lithium-ion batteries (LiBs), is selected as the secondary component to the graphene supports by pre- or post-graphenization. Recently, SnO2 has become very attractive as the anode material for the next-generation LiBs because of its high theoretical capacity of 790 mA h g−1. As shown in Fig. 1, both pre-graphenization and post-graphenization process are carried out for SnO2@graphene hybrid fabrication, and SnO2@TRG and SnO2@CRG electrodes are obtained and carefully characterized. Both the graphenes and their hybrids are evaluated for supercapacitors and Li-ion battery electrodes, so as to provide insightful materials chemistry towards development of advanced graphene-based electrodes.
2. Experimental
2.1 Pre-graphenization: SnO2@TRG hybrids
The thermally reduced graphene was obtained by thermal expansion of GO powder under high vacuum. GO was prepared by a modified Hummers method. The as-prepared GO was put into a quartz tube that was sealed at one end and stoppered at the other end, through which the reactor was connected to the high vacuum pump. The tube was heated at a rate of 30 °C min−1 under high vacuum (<3.0 Pa). At about 200 °C, an abrupt expansion was observed. To remove the abundant functional groups, the expanded GO was kept at 250 °C for 20 min and a high vacuum was maintained (below 5.0 Pa) during heat treatment. The as-prepared graphene sample was denoted as TRG. The SnO2@TRG hybrids were prepared by a facile excessive impregnation of the above TRG. In a typical process, 500 mg of TRG was mixed with 500 mL of 0.1 M SnCl2 aqueous solution (with 0.1 M HCl as pH adjuster) in an ice bath (∼0 °C). The black mixture was kept in the ice bath with intensive stirring for 10 min, to realize moderate anchoring of Sn2+ on the active sites of graphene. The product was isolated by vacuum filtration and rinsed copiously with water (5 × 100 mL) and ethanol (5 × 100 mL). Finally, the sample was air dried at 110 °C for 24 h to obtain SnO2@TRG hybrids.
2.2 Post-graphenization: SnO2@CRG hybrids
The CRG was prepared by a chemical reduction approach. In a typical procedure, GO (500 mg) was dispersed in 500 mL water followed by sonication (200 W) for 30 min to yield a homogeneous brown hydrosol of graphene oxide. The above hydrosol was mixed with 50 mL hydrazine monohydrate (NH2–NH2·H2O, 100%) in a 1000 mL round-bottom flask, and heated in an oil bath at 100 °C under a water-cooled condenser for 24 h, during which the reduced GO gradually precipitated out as black solids. The product was isolated by vacuum filtration and washed thoroughly with water and ethanol to remove excessive metal salts. Finally, the sample was air dried in a watch glass at 110 °C for 24 h to obtain chemically reduced graphene. The SnO2@CRG hybrids were prepared by pre-impregnation of graphene oxide followed by a similar chemical reduction approach. In a typical experimental, 500 mL of graphene oxide hydrosol (1.0 mg mL−1) was pre-mixed with 250 mL of SnCl2 aqueous solution (concentration of 0.32 mg mL−1 with 0.10 M HCl as pH adjuster). The mixture was stirred in a ice bath for 10 min, and then moved to an oil bath over which 50 mL of 100% NH2–NH2·H2O was added gradually. The solution was heated and kept at 100 °C with intensive stirring under a water-cooled condenser for 24 h. The as-prepared products of SnO2@CRG hybrids are separated, washed and dried using the same method as mentioned above for CRG.
2.3 Sample characterization
The morphologies of the samples were characterized using a Hitachi S4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) operated at 2.0 kV and a Philips CM200 LaB6 transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 200.0 kV; the HRTEM images of the samples were collected on a FEI Cs-corrected Titan 80-300 microscope operated at 80.0 kV. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed using a Titan 80-300 apparatus with the analytical software INCA. The samples were ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol, and then a drop of the solution was deposited on a Lacey carbon film grid to be used for TEM characterization; X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed at room temperature (Cu Kα radiation, k = 0.15406 nm, D8 Advance, BRUKER/AXS, Germany); X-ray fluorescence (XRF) was employed to analyze the elemental composition of the samples. Before XRF testing, the sample was pre-grinded with wax in ethanol to form a slurry, and then pressed into a pellet with thickness of ca. 35 mm; Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas and Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions of the SnO2–graphene hybrids were determined by N2 physisorption at 77 K using a Micromeritics 2375 BET apparatus; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on the Thermo VG ESCALAB250 surface analysis system with parameters: Al Kα = 1486.6 eV, Power = 150 W (HV = 15 kV and I = 10 mA), spot size = 500 lm, pass energy 50.0 eV and energy step size 0.1 eV.
2.4 Supercapacitor performance measurements
The electrochemical properties of graphene–SnO2 hybrids were measured in an aqueous system (electrolyte: 6.0 M KOH). A three-electrode system was employed in the measurement, whereby Ni foam coated with electrode materials served as the working electrode, a platinum foil electrode as counter electrode and a saturated hydrogen electrode (SHE) served as reference electrode. In order to prepare a working electrode, a mixture of our active material, carbon black, and poly(tetrafluoroethylene) with a weight ratio of 80:5:15 was ground together to form a homogeneous slurry. The slurry was squeezed into a film and then punched into pellets. The punched pellets with a piece of nickel foam on each side were pressed under 2.5 MPa and dried overnight at 110 °C. Each electrode was quantified to contain roughly 5.0 mg active materials. The electrodes were impregnated with electrolyte under vacuum for 1.0 h prior to the electrochemical evaluation. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves (scan rates varying from 3 to 500 mV s−1) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) profiles were measured with a VSP BioLogic electrochemistry workstation. The electrochemical capacitances were both obtained from CV curves. The Nyquist plot was fitted by EC-Lab software.
2.5 Li-ion battery performance measurements
The performances of graphene-based hybrids as anode materials for lithium ion batteries were tested with CR2025 coin cells. A mixture of SnO2@CRG nanocomposites or SnO2@TRG, carbon black, and polyvinylidene fluoride at a weight ratio of 80:10:10 was pasted on pure Cu foil (99.6%, Goodfellow) to make the working electrode. A microporous polyethylene sheet (Celgard 2400) was used as separator. The electrolyte was 1.0 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixed solution of ethylene carbonate–dimethyl carbonate–ethylene methyl carbonate (1:1:1, by weight) obtained from Ube Industries Ltd. Pure lithium foil (Aldrich) was used as counter electrode. The cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box. The discharge and charge measurements were carried out at different current densities in the voltage range of 0–3.0 V on a Neware battery test system. The specific capacity of the SnO2@graphene nanocomposites was calculated based on the mass of the anode materials (SnO2 and graphene). Cyclic voltammogram measurements were performed on a Solartron 1470E electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Pre-graphenization: structure of TRG and SnO2@TRG hybrids
In the pre-graphenization process, the GO is thermally expanded and reduced into a fluffy black powder.21 As shown in Fig. 2a, the as-obtained TRGs have a hierarchically honeycomb-like morphology: the crumpled graphene sheets with many ripples and wrinkles are loosely stacked or folded with each other to construct a continuous and interconnected 3D macroscopic architecture, with a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of ∼293 m2 g−1. The diameter of the macropores ranges from 100 to 300 nm (Fig. 2a and b). The TRG has a coarse edge, which can be attributed to the fast decomposition of oxygen-containing functional groups (such as carboxyl, carbonyl groups) during thermal exfoliation. After the impregnation and calcination process, the pre-graphenized SnO2@TRG hybrid still holds a porous morphology with twisted and loosely packed graphene sheets. However, the regularity of the ordered honeycomb structure is lost gradually. As the basic building blocks, the graphene sheets are larger than 1 μm in diameter, between which pores ranging from 20 to 100 nm are clearly identified (Fig. 2c). The microtexture of SnO2@TRG was further examined by TEM, SnO2 nanoparticles with sizes ranging between 3 and 5 nm with a density of ca. 4 × 1012 cm−2 are formed on the graphene sheets. Some of the SnO2 particles are agglomerated into chain-like structures. A lattice with a d110 space of ∼3.35 Å can be clearly demonstrated on the inserted figure of the high resolution TEM images (Fig. 2d), indicating a good crystallization of SnO2.15

The fine scan X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy (collected at a very slow scan rate of 0.1° min−1) is employed to verify the crystallite structure of pre-graphenized samples. After thermal graphenization, TRG exhibits a tiny sharp peak (002) with a broad shoulder at ∼26.6° and a very weak peak (101) at 43.6°, The sharp peak is attributed to the thin-layer graphitic microcrystalline stacking by graphene layers due to inadequate exfoliation of graphite oxide during thermal expansion, while the shoulder is ascribed to the local positive fluctuation of interlayer spacing of graphene layers due to the rotation, translation, curvature and fluctuation of atomic positions along the normal of graphene layers (Fig. 3a).22 After SnO2 introduction, despite the carbon related peaks, several very weak peaks around 33.2°, 51.7°, 64.0° emerge, which are assigned to the (101), (211) and (310) lines of the newly formed α-SnO2 phase, respectively, while the increase in the intensity of the peak and shoulder at ∼26.6° is ascribed to a secondary re-stacking of graphene during impregnation and drying, and the amalgamation of the (002) line of graphite with the nearby (110) line of SnO2. The crystalline size along the (110) lattice (L(110)) of SnO2 is estimated to be ∼3.8 nm according to the Scherrer equation, which is consistent with the TEM observation.

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms are carried out to evaluate the change of pore structure for TRG before and after SnO2 impregnation. As shown in Fig. 2c, both sorption isotherms exhibit the typical Type III isotherm with H3 hysteresis loop according to IUPAC classification, showing materials characteristic of macropores (pore size >50 nm) and comprised of aggregates (loose assemblages) of plate-like particles forming slit-like mesopores (Fig. 3b). The specific BET surface area (SBET), t-plot micropore surface area (pore size <2 nm) (Smicro), and total pore volume (VP) of TRG and SnO2@TRG are summarized in Table 1. After SnO2 impregnation, the SBET is slightly increased from 293 to 325 m2 g−1, while the VP is decreased simultaneously from 1.62 to 1.26 cm3 g−1, with a corresponding increase of Smicro from 6.9 to 12.8 m2 g−1. The BJH adsorption pore size distribution (Fig. 3c) indicates the key role of exterior meso- and macropores with relatively larger diameters (pore size >2 nm) in contributing the SBET of TRG and SnO2@TRG, however, the average diameter of the pore is decreasing after the introduction of SnO2. The evolution of porous structure is attributable to the collapse of exterior macropores due to the capillary effect during solution based impregnation and the air drying process (Fig. 3c).

Furthermore, the XPS results show that the atomic percentages of Sn, C, and O element are 1.71, 85.84, and 12.44 at%, respectively (Table 1). From the fine scan of SnO2@TRG (Fig. 3d), the Sn components present the typical 3d5/2 (485.6 eV) and 3d3/2 (494.0 eV) level with a gap of 8.4 eV and area ratio of ∼1.5, which further confirms the state of SnO2 on TRG.14
3.2 Post-graphenization: structure of SnO2@CRG hybrids
The other route for SnO2@graphene hybrids is post-graphenization, in which the Sn4+ species are grafted onto the surface of GO in advance, and then the chemical transformation from graphene oxide into graphene is conducted by solution based chemical reduction. As shown in Fig. 4a, the CRG exhibits closely packed graphene agglomerates, in which the graphene sheets with high-density ripples and wrinkles are randomly crumpled (Fig. 4b). After SnO2 addition, the post-graphenized SnO2@CRG hybrid still holds a highly twisted structure (Fig. 4c), in which only micropores and mesopores are observed. SnO2 nanoparticles with a density of ca. 3 × 1012 cm2 and a diameter of 3.5–5.5 nm are uniformly distributed on the graphene sheets. The lattice of SnO2 (d110 ∼ 3.35 Å) can be clearly observed on the HRTEM images (Fig. 4d), which implies a high crystallization degree of the SnO2 particles.
 Fig. 4  (a) SEM and (b) TEM images of CRG; (c) SEM and (d) TEM images of SnO2@CRG. 
Comparing with the pre-graphenized TRG, CRG exhibits broader and stronger diffraction peaks of the graphite (002) and (101) lattice in the XRD pattern (Fig. 5a), indicating an over re-stacking and entanglement of graphenes within the macro-assembly. However, after introduction of only 2 wt% of Sn components, the graphite associated peaks are significantly minimised with the emersion of very weak SnO2 peaks, due to the formation of SnO2 nanocrystals which could further act as the isolation spacers between graphene. Thus, the BET surface area is extended from CRG (666 m2 g−1) to SnO2@CRG (818 m2 g−1), as more closed pores may become opened ones which are accessible to the N2 molecules (Table 1).23
 Fig. 5  (a) XRD patterns, (b) N2 sorption isotherms and (c) BJH adsorption pore size distributions of CRG and SnO2@CRG; (d) XPS Sn3d fine scan spectrum of SnO2@CRG. 
Furthermore, the N2 sorption isotherms of both CRG and SnO2@CRG, as shown in Fig. 5b, present a typical Type IV isotherm with apparent H2 hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of ink-bottle pores between graphene sheets in the architecture. It is noteworthy that the curve of the N2 sorption isotherm of CRG is apparently different from that of TRG (Fig. 3b and 5b) and there are no macropores in CRG (Fig. 5b). In addition, the SBET of CRG (666 m2 g−1) is higher than that of TRG (293 m2 g−1). These phenomena are mainly attributed to over re-stacking and entanglement of graphenes in CRG materials, generating more mesopores, and to inadequate exfoliation of graphite oxide in TRG. After SnO2 introduction, the pore volume is increased from 0.60 to 1.09 cm3 g−1 and the vanishing micropore surface area in SnO2@CRG is observed. The BJH adsorption pore size distribution of CRG and SnO2@CRG exhibits the parabolic profile with peaks at ∼4 and ∼10 nm, respectively (Fig. 5c), which is distinct from pre-graphenized SnO2@TRG samples.
As calculated from XPS, the surface contents of Sn, C, and O on SnO2@CRG are determined to be 0.74, 88.06, and 11.21 at%, respectively (Table 1). The Sn3d fine scan spectrum exhibits the similar 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 line to SnO2@TRG at 486.5, 495.0 eV with a gap of 8.5 eV, indicating the grafting of SnO2 on CRG. However, the content of Sn in SnO2@CRG is much less than that of SnO2@TRG, as confirmed by XPS and XRF analysis (Table 1).
In the post-graphenization process, due to π–π interaction between graphene sheets, the reduced graphene oxide sheets are likely to be re-stacked into agglomerations in the solution based reduction procedure. Attributing to the removal of negatively charged functional groups, the electrostatic repulsion which keeps the graphene oxide hydrosol stable is decreased.24 The agglomeration became even more severe due to the capillary attraction effect, as water molecule spacers are spilled out from the graphene interlayer in the final drying process.25 However, the pre-introduced SnO2 species on the basal plane of graphene oxide could act as the spacers between graphene so as to prevent the over-compact restacking and agglomeration of graphene during the “wet” process of reduction and drying.
3.3 Electrochemical performance
The SnO2@TRG and SnO2@CRG hybrids exhibit distinct microstructures (e.g. pore structure, particle loading state, composite interfacial property and functionalities) for their different origin of fabrication processes (pre-graphenization or post-graphenizaton). It would be interesting and meaningful to correlate these structural differences with their electrochemical performance as energy storage materials. Thus, SnO2@TRG and SnO2@CRG, with the bare sample TRG and CRG as references, are fabricated and evaluated as electrodes for supercapacitors and Li-ion batteries, respectively.

3.3.1 Supercapacitor. 
Cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectrum, and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GC) techniques are employed to characterize the supercapacitor performance. As shown in Fig. 6a, at a very low scan rate of 3.0 mV s−1, the CV curve of each sample indicates a typical electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) character. Among them, SnO2@CRG exhibits a more prominent Faradic redox reaction behavior with relatively lower resistance. Fig. 6c shows the CV characteristics of SnO2@CRG at different scanning rates, which maintain an EDLC behavior at the higher scan rates of over 200 mV s−1. The gravimetric capacitance (CF, F g−1) of each electrode at various scan rates is calculated from CV curves and presented in Fig. 6b, while the initial CF and associated specific capacitance (CS, F m−2) at 3 mV s−1 is shown in Fig. 6d. It is found that the bare samples TRG and CRG exhibit quite a similar capacitance (162.1 F g−1 and 169.3 F g−1). However, as the scan rate increases, the value of CRG drops very fast with a final retention of 22.6% at 500 mV s−1, which is significantly lower compared with TRG (35.1% at 500 mV s−1). This phenomenon is in accordance with microstructure and pore structure of thermal/chemical reduced graphene. On one hand, with the exterior porous structure of the assembly and residual surface oxygen functionalities on each basic building block, TRG is endowed with the active surface areas which are highly accessible to the electrolyte. Conversely, the inner surface of ink-bottle pores in CRG, which greatly contribute to the BET surface area, is very difficult to be wetted by the electrolyte. Therefore, though the BET area of TRG (293 m2 g−1) is significantly smaller than that of CRG (666 m2 g−1), the specific capacitance per BET area (CS) of TRG (0.55 F m−2) is remarkably higher than that of CRG (0.25 F m−2). On the other hand, the “open” structure of TRG with numerous large pores could serve as the buffer pool to the electrolyte, thus providing a convenient path for ion diffusion between the graphene sheets and electrolyte. Therefore, the TRG electrode exhibits a relatively quicker response in charge/discharge cycling than CRG constructed by over compacted graphene sheets.

The TRG and CRG, after introduction of SnO2 nano-particles to form the hybrids of SnO2@TRG and SnO2@CRG, behave quite differently as supercapacitor electrodes. As shown in Fig. 6d, both the initial CF at 3 mV s−1 and the capacitance retention at higher scan rates of SnO2@CRG are improved significantly. However, the supercapacitor performance of the SnO2@TRG electrode is not enhanced as expected, but rather decreased compared with the bare TRG. As a result, the SnO2@CRG exhibits the highest CF as a supercapacitor electrode among all the samples, with an initial CF approaching 189.4 F g−1 and retention of 33.7% at 3.0 mV s−1. The controversial effects of SnO2 hybridization on supercapacitor performance are primarily dependent on the pre- or post-graphenization strategy induced structural difference of the resulting materials.
The GC curves at the current density of 1.0 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 7a. All samples exhibit the typical symmetrical charge–discharge patterns of a supercapacitor. In accordance with the capacitances calculated from CV curves, the SnO2@CRG has the best performance on energy storage among the four samples (184.0 F g−1).

To further confirm the double layer formation of the electrodes, AC impedance spectroscopy is employed to determine the internal components of the devices (Nyquist plots as shown in Fig. 7b). An equivalent circuit model (inset of Fig. 7b) is introduced to simulate the capacitive and resistive elements of the cells under analysis. These elements include the internal resistance of the graphene-based electrode (Ri), the capacitance and resistance due to contact interface (Cc and Rc), a Warburg diffusion element attributable to the ion migration through the graphene (Zw), and the capacitance inside the pores (Cd).26 The fitting results are shown in Table 2. In accordance with the synthesis strategy induced structural difference, the as-received SnO2@graphene hybrids by either pre-graphenization or post-graphenization exhibit a decrease in internal resistance (Ri), due to the increase of charge carrier density in graphene lattice from the electron donor-SnO2 nanoparticles. As a result, SnO2@CRG has the minimum Ri (0.51 Ω) among the four samples. However, the ion diffusion behavior shows distinct tendency upon SnO2 decoration by two different graphenization strategies. Compared with TRG (0.71 Ω s−1/2), the Warburg diffusion resistance of SnO2@TRG is increased to 0.74 Ω s−1/2, which is ascribed to the collapse of some honeycomb-like structures during the impregnation and drying process. Conversely, the value for SnO2@CRG (0.36 Ω s−1/2) is smaller than that of CRG (0.45 Ω s−1/2), which is attributed to the prominent “spacer” effect of SnO2 nano-particles. Thereafter, from a viewpoint of thermodynamics, the mass transfer within the electrochemical system is significantly promoted through: (i) improvement of charge transfer along the graphene lattice and between graphene by π–π interactions of delocalized electrons arising from both graphitic domains and SnO2 electron donors; and (ii) optimization of the porous structure by preventing the re-stacking of graphene so as to offer a low resistance channel for ion diffusion. Thus, the PC-active SnO2 species combining with the graphene surface inside the pores of SnO2@CRG are highly accessible to the ions of electrolyte, so as to give rise to capacitance inside pores with a maximum value of as high as 232.53 F g−1 among the four samples.

3.3.2 Li-ion battery. 
SnO2 shows a high theoretical capacity of Li+ intercalations–deintercalations (790 mA h g−1), which makes it a promising anode material for Li-ion batteries. Fig. 8 shows the representative CVs of the sample. Specifically, two pairs of redox current peaks can be clearly observed. The first dominant pair (cathodic, anodic) shown at the potential (V) of (0.01, 0.7) can be attributed to the alloying (cathodic scan) and dealloying (anodic scan) processes. The first pair is much more pronounced than the second pair, marking its major contribution to the total capacity of the cell. The intensity of this pair of SnO2@TRG is much higher than that of SnO2@CRG, which is attributed to higher loading of SnO2 on TRG (2.17%) than that on CRG (0.94%). The second pair at (0.65, 1.3) is mainly appeared on the SnO2@TRG electrode. This pair of redox peaks is related to the irreversible reduction of SnO2 to Sn, which disappeared in the second cycle. Comparing the second cycle to the first one, the decreased intensity is mainly attributed to the reaction of oxygen-containing functional groups on graphene with lithium ions and the formation of a surface polymeric layer due to the decomposition of the solvent in the electrolyte.
 Fig. 8  The cyclic voltammogram of the SnO2@T/CRG nanocomposite at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. 
The rate performances of SnO2@TRG and SnO2@CRG are demonstrated in Fig. 9. The discharge capacities in the 1st cycle are 1468 mA h g−1 for SnO2@TRG, and 978 mA h g−1 for SnO2@CRG. The formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is the main reason that caused the large capacity and also the irreversible capacity loss. For the 2nd cycle, the discharge capacities are 857 mA h g−1 for SnO2@TRG, and 375 mA h g−1 for SnO2@CRG. The discharge capacities in the 6th cycle are 707 mA h g−1 for SnO2@TRG with a coulombic efficiency of 90%, and 366 mA h g−1 for SnO2@CRG with a coulombic efficiency of 94%. With higher current density during the galvanostatic discharge (Li insertion, voltage decreases)/charge (Li extraction, voltage increases) process, the discharge capacity further decreased. The discharge capacities in the 7th cycle (current density at 400 mA g−1) are 580 mA h g−1 for SnO2@TRG, and 366 mA h g−1 for SnO2@CRG. Further increase of charge and discharge current to 800 mA g−1 caused the drop of capacity of SnO2@TRG and SnO2@CRG to 286 and 206 mA h g−1, respectively. Upon returning back to a low current density of 100 mA g−1, the discharge capacities for SnO2@TRG and SnO2@CRG recovered to 540 and 271 mA h g−1 at the 17th cycle. Comparing the performance of TRG and CRG (Fig. S1†), the addition of SnO2 acted as spacer for the CRG sample, but a filler in the TGR pores. The graphene electrode afforded the main characteristics of Li storage for the current hybrid electrode. Compared with the CRG electrode, improved Li storage performance for SnO2@CRG was presented; while the discharging capacity of SnO2@TRG was not as high as that of pure TRG anode materials.
 Fig. 9  The discharge capacity at different charge/discharge current rates for SnO2@TRG and SnO2@CRG nanocomposites. 
The cycling performances of SnO2@graphene composite and pure graphene anode materials are presented in Fig. 10 and S2†, respectively. With a charge/discharge current density at 400 mA g−1, SnO2@TRG and SnO2@CRG composites show discharge capacities of 204 and 196 mA h g−1 even after 100 cycles (Fig. 10). A rapid capacity loss can be observed during the initial three cycles for SnO2@CRG and CRG. In contrast, a gradual loss occurred on SnO2@TRG and TRG. The higher initial discharge capacity of the SnO2@TRG composite can be attributed to its loading amount of SnO2 as shown in Table 1. However, because of the unstable porous structure and complex surface chemistry, the high capacity of both SnO2@TRG and TRG is not well maintained. This indicated that pre-graphenization provides huge surface area for more metal oxide anchoring, while such a porous TRG is not very stable. In contrast, the post-graphenization process provides more anchoring sites for the formation of a large number of small SnO2 particles, and the as-obtained SnO2@CRG shows a more stable behavior as an anode material.

4. Conclusions
To clarify the effect of pre- or post-graphenization for graphene-based hybrids, two kinds of SnO2@graphene hybrids are explored with the same GO and Sn precursors. For the pre-graphenization strategy: the thermally reduced graphene is obtained before the second component (SnO2) is introduced; for the post-graphenization strategy: a composite composed of graphene oxide and the second component (SnO2) is pre-prepared, followed by converting the precursor into chemically reduced graphene. The SnO2 nanoparticles with a loading of 6.3 wt% are distributed on porous TRG, while a loading of 3.3 wt% was determined on compacted CRG. When the SnO2@graphene is used as a supercapacitor electrode, the SnO2@CRG exhibits the highest CF as a supercapacitor electrode among all the samples with an initial CF approaching 189.4 F g−1 and retention of 33.7% at 3.0 mV s−1. The gravimetric capacitance of CRG drops very fast with a final retention of 22.6% at 500 mV s−1, which is significantly lower compared with TRG (35.1% at 500 mV s−1). When they are employed as Li-ion battery electrodes, the discharge capacities in the 1st cycle are 1468 and 978 mA h g−1 for SnO2@TRG and SnO2@CRG, respectively. With higher current density during the galvanostatic discharge (Li insertion, voltage decreases)/charge (Li extraction, voltage increases) process, the discharge capacities of both SnO2@TRG and SnO2@CRG decreased gradually. Even after 100 cycles at 400 mA g−1, a discharging capacity of 204 and 196 mA h g−1 can still be retained for SnO2@TRG and SnO2@CRG, respectively. This suggested that the method of graphenization provides the hybrid with different structure and electrochemical performance. The pre-graphenization process provides a large amount of pores for ion diffusion, which is of benefit for loading of SnO2, fast ion diffusion for supercapacitors, and higher capacity for Li-ion batteries, but poor stability, while the post-graphenization process offers compact graphene and good interaction between the SnO2 and graphene, which provides stable structure for long term stability for supercapacitor and Li-ion battery use. The optimized graphenization method for graphene hybrids should be further explored to provide new insights into hybrid formation and advanced materials for energy storage.
