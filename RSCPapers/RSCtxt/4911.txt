    , Accepted 6th July 2021First published on 14th July 2021AbstractThe photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation performance of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes is jointly restricted by their high charge recombination and sluggish water oxidation kinetics. Herein, through coupling Ag and CdS nanoparticles with an α-Fe2O3 nanorod film, a new kind of α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS ternary heterojunction film was constructed and investigated as a photoanode for solar water oxidation. The resultant α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode can take full advantages of the α-Fe2O3/CdS heterojunction and the properties of Ag nanoparticles. Specifically, the formation of the α-Fe2O3/CdS heterojunction improves the charge separation and transfer efficiency of the α-Fe2O3 photoanode through band potential differences. Meanwhile, the presence of Ag nanoparticles enlarges the absorption edge of α-Fe2O3/CdS and decreases the electron–hole recombination through their surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. In addition, the electrocatalytic properties of Ag nanoparticles could initiate the water oxidation on the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode jointly. As a result, a higher photocurrent density of 3.25 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE was achieved on the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode during water oxidation, which is 2.5 times higher relative to the photocurrent of the α-Fe2O3 photoanode. Furthermore, the onset potential of water oxidation on the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode was negatively shifted about 220 mV relative to the α-Fe2O3 photoanode due to its faster kinetics. With the protection of the amorphous TiO2 layer, the water oxidation activity of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode can be steadily maintained even after 10 h of reaction at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The present work provides an efficient strategy for the development of α-Fe2O3-based ternary heterojunction photoanodes for solar water oxidation.
Introduction
Using semiconductor photoelectrodes, solar energy can be converted into hydrogen fuel by photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting.1,2 On the whole, PEC water splitting involves two half reactions: the four-hole reaction of water oxidation into oxygen on a photoanode as well as the two-electron reaction of proton reduction into hydrogen on a photocathode.3 Since the kinetics of water oxidation on a photoanode is more sluggish than that of proton reduction on a photocathode, development of suitable photoanode materials for efficient water oxidation is the key direction of PEC water splitting research.4 Due to the superiorities in the band gap and position, reaction stability, and preparation cost, hematite (α-Fe2O3) has been considered as a promising photoanode material for solar water oxidation.5–7 The band gap of α-Fe2O3 is about 2.1 eV and its valence band edge is around 2.5 V vs. RHE, which suggest ∼15% solar energy can be absorbed and potentially used by an α-Fe2O3 photoanode for the water splitting reaction.8,9 In addition, α-Fe2O3 has good stability in neutral and alkaline solutions, and raw materials for α-Fe2O3 preparation are cheap and nontoxic. But it is regrettable that the severe recombination of electron–hole pairs and sluggish kinetics of water oxidation jointly limit the PEC water oxidation activity of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes.10–12 To achieve efficient water oxidation on α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, the modifications of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes have to be concentrated on the above activity obstacles.
As is well known, the oxidation of water into oxygen on photoanodes is a typical heterogeneous catalytic process. The recombination of electron–hole pairs of photoanodes during water oxidation is mainly related to their thermodynamic properties,13 while the kinetics of water oxidation on photoanodes is affected by their kinetic properties.14 In the past few years, the construction of α-Fe2O3/photocatalyst heterojunction photoanodes has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to address the activity limitations of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes.15–17 In principle, the band edge difference between α-Fe2O3 and the coupled photocatalyst can drive the transfer and separation of charge directionally through the heterojunction. Furthermore, α-Fe2O3/photocatalyst photoanodes can integrate the advantages of α-Fe2O3 and the coupled photocatalyst, which may promote the water oxidation kinetics of α-Fe2O3 if the coupled photocatalyst has electrocatalytic properties. Accordingly, a series of α-Fe2O3/photocatalyst heterojunction photoanodes (such as Si/α-Fe2O3, Co3O4/Fe2O3, Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5) display superior PEC water oxidation activity relative to the α-Fe2O3 photoanode.18–20 It is noteworthy that the absorption edge of α-Fe2O3/photocatalyst heterojunction photoanodes of solar spectral absorption is strictly determined by the band gap of α-Fe2O3 and the coupled photocatalyst.21–24 Since the charge transfer and separation of α-Fe2O3/photocatalyst photoanodes are not as high as expected, the enlargement of the solar absorption edge of α-Fe2O3/photocatalyst photoanodes is a significant approach to improve their water oxidation activity. Based on the surface plasmon resonance effect of metal nanoparticles, the solar absorption edge and catalytic activity of photocatalysts can be obviously expanded through coupling with suitable metal nanoparticles.25–30 Inspired by the construction of α-Fe2O3/photocatalyst and photocatalyst/metal nanoparticle heterojunctions to achieve efficient photocatalytic activity, it can be inferred that α-Fe2O3/photocatalyst/metal nanoparticle ternary heterojunctions may have better function of utilizing solar energy to initiate PEC water oxidation.
Herein, we constructed an α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS ternary heterojunction photoanode through the coupling of Ag and CdS nanoparticles with an α-Fe2O3 nanorod film. Compared with the α-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3/CdS photoanodes, the resultant α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode shows higher water oxidation activity as well as faster kinetics by taking full advantage of its ternary heterojunction. Firstly, the formation of the α-Fe2O3/CdS heterojunction can improve the charge transfer and separation efficiency of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. Secondly, the presence of Ag nanoparticles enlarges the absorption edge of α-Fe2O3/CdS and decreases the electron–hole recombination through the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. Finally, the electrocatalytic properties of Ag nanoparticles could initiate the water oxidation on the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode jointly. Consequently, a higher photocurrent density of 3.25 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE was achieved on the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode during water oxidation, and its onset potential for PEC water oxidation was negatively shifted about 220 mV relative to the α-Fe2O3 photoanode owing to faster kinetics. The water oxidation activity of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode can be steadily maintained with the protection of the amorphous TiO2 layer.
Experimental
Chemicals
Hexahydrate ferric chloride (FeCl3·3H2O, ≥99.0%, HuShi), urea (CH4N2O, ≥99.0%, HuShi), titanium trichloride (15.0–20.0% TiCl3 basis in 30% HCl, 3A Chemicals), silver nitrate (AgNO3, ≥99.8%, HuShi), cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, ≥99.0%, 3A Chemicals), thiocarbamide (CH4N2S, ≥99.0%, HuShi), titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4, ≥99.0%, Aladdin), F-doped tin oxide conductive glass (FTO, 20 × 10 × 2.2 mm, square resistance ≤ 7 Ω).
Synthesis of the samples
The ternary heterojunction photoanode consisted of an α-Fe2O3 nanorod film, as well as Ag and CdS nanoparticles. Scheme 1 shows the fabrication process of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS ternary photoanode. (1) A Ti-doped FeOOH nanorod film was firstly grown on FTO by a hydrothermal method that has been reported in our previous work.31 The hydrothermal precursor solution contained 20 mL of 0.3 M ferric chloride hexahydrate and 0.15 M carbamide aqueous solution, as well as 70 μL of titanium dichloride. The hydrothermal reaction was conducted at 100 °C for 6 h. (2) The resultant Ti-doped FeOOH nanorod film was annealed in a muffle furnace in air at 550 °C for 120 min, and further annealed at 650 °C for 15 min to transform into a Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 film (for convenience of description, the following Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanodes are collectively referred to as α-Fe2O3). The heating rate of the muffle furnace was set to be 10 °C min−1. (3) After the annealing procedure, the sample was quickly removed from the muffle furnace when it cooled naturally to 500 °C (Scheme 1a and b).

After the synthesis of the α-Fe2O3 nanorod film, Ag nanoparticles were coupled on the α-Fe2O3 nanorod film by a wet chemical method. Specifically, the α-Fe2O3 film was put into 100 mL aqueous solution at 95 °C for 10 min, the aqueous solution contained 4 mM silver nitrate and 5 mM sodium citrate (Scheme 1b and c). After the reaction, the resultant film was cleaned with deionized water and blow-dried with nitrogen gas. The α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS film was prepared by a spin-coating method. 20 μL of aqueous solution that contained 0.5 M cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate and 0.5 M thiocarbamide was dropped onto the surface of the α-Fe2O3/Ag film for spin-coating. The spin-coating rate was 3000 rps, and the spin-coating time was 30 s. The resultant sample was annealed at 100 °C for 1.5 h in air to form an α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS film (Scheme 1c and d). For comparison, the α-Fe2O3/CdS film was prepared by the same method. In addition, the amorphous TiO2 layer was deposited on the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS film by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) approach. The precursor solution was titanium tetrachloride and deionized water, and the ALD reactor was a Picosun SUNALETM R-150B. The ALD was repeated 60 cycles at 150 °C.
Sample characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI NOVA NanoSEM230) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-200CX) were used to observe the morphology and microstructure of the samples. The crystal structure and composition of the samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Ultima III, Rigaku) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250), respectively. A UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu) was used to collect the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the samples. A transient fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi F-4600) was applied to study the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectrum of the samples.
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
The electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted on a CHI-660E workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Co., Ltd.) in a three-electrode cell. The as-prepared film samples were used as the working electrode, a Pt wire electrode was the counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl electrode was the reference electrode. The calculation formula of the potential conversion of the working electrode from the reference Ag/AgCl (vs. Ag/AgCl) to the reference reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) is as follows: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + EΘAg/AgCl + 0.05916 × pH(1)where ERHE is the converted potential vs. RHE, EAg/AgCl is the measured potential vs. Ag/AgCl, and pH is the pH value of the electrolyte. A 1.0 M NaOH aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. The irradiation source was a PLS-SXE 300 xenon lamp (Beijing PerfectLight Co., Ltd.) with an AM 1.5G filter to provide one-sunlight irradiation (100 W cm−2). The film was fixed with a black mask and provided an illuminated area of 0.28 cm2 for PEC investigations (Fig. S1†). The potential range of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) testing was 0.4 to 1.7 V vs. RHE, and the scan rate was 20 mV s−1. The potential of I–T testing was 1.23 V vs. RHE, and the time interval of illumination and darkness was 20 s. The potential and frequency of EIS testing were 1.23 V vs. RHE and 0.1–10 kHz, respectively. The Mott–Schottky testing was performed in the potential range of 0.4 to 1.1 V vs. RHE at frequencies of 500 and 1000 Hz, respectively.
To investigate the charge separation efficiency (ηsep) and charge injection efficiency (ηinj) of photoanodes, 0.1 M Na2SO3 was added into the 1.0 M NaOH electrolyte as a hole scavenger. ηsep and ηinj were calculated using following the formulas: (2) (3)where JNa2SO3 is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) of the photoanode in 1.0 M NaOH/0.1 M Na2SO3 mixed solution; Jabs is the theoretical maximum photocurrent density of the photoanode; JNaOH is the photocurrent density of the photoanode in 1.0 M NaOH.
The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of the samples was calculated from their current density–potential curves using the following equation. (4)here Jp (mA cm−2) represents the current density of the samples under bias applied (Vbias, V vs. RHE) and P is the power density of incident illumination.
The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the samples was calculated from their current density–potential curves under incident monochromatic illumination using eqn (2). (5)where Jp (mA cm−2) refers to the current density of the samples, P (mW cm−2) is the power density of monochromatic illumination, and λ (nm) corresponds to the incident wavelength.
Results and discussion
The typical morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared α-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS samples are shown in Fig. 1a–f. From the SEM and TEM images of the α-Fe2O3 sample (Fig. 1a and b), we can observe that the α-Fe2O3 film consisted of nanorod arrays, and the diameter of the nanorod is about 80 nm. For the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS sample, its main structure is the α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays, while the Ag and CdS nanoparticles were coupled on the α-Fe2O3 nanorods evenly (Fig. 1d and e). The interface in contact between α-Fe2O3 nanorods and Ag/CdS nanoparticles would form heterojunctions naturally. The cross-sectional SEM image is shown in Fig. S2,† and the thickness of the film is about 500 nm. The microstructure of α-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS was further observed from their HR-TEM image. As shown in Fig. 1c, α-Fe2O3 has a lattice fringe of 0.25 nm, which well corresponds to the (110) crystal plane of α-Fe2O3. In the HR-TEM image of α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS (Fig. 1f), its heterojunction feature is demonstrated clearly. The larger lattice fringes are the α-Fe2O3 (110) crystal planes, the smaller lattice fringes are the CdS (200) crystal planes (0.28 nm), and the particle lattice fringe regions are the Ag (200) crystal planes (0.20 nm). It should be pointed out that the tight interfacial connection between α-Fe2O3/CdS/Ag should have influence on its PEC reaction relative to bare α-Fe2O3. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis further confirmed the heterojunction feature of α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS (Fig. 1g). In the EDX mapping image, Fe and O elements are observed on the whole scale with uniform distribution, and the contents of Ag, Cd and S elements are smaller, indicating that a spot of Ag/CdS nanoparticles coupled on the α-Fe2O3 nanorods uniformly.

Fig. 2a shows the XRD pattern of the resultant α-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS samples. Two same α-Fe2O3 diffraction peaks at 35.61° and 63.98° (JCPDS: 33-0664) were observed in the XRD pattern of α-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS, in addition to the SnO2 diffraction peaks of the FTO substrate. However, a characteristic peak of CdS at 32.77° (JCPDS: 21-0829) is shown in the XRD pattern of α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS. Due to the low content of Ag nanoparticles, no diffraction peak of Ag was observed in the XRD pattern of α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS. When the preparation time of Ag nanoparticles on the α-Fe2O3 film was extended to 1 h, the XRD peaks of Ag at 38.11° and 44.27° (JCPDS: 04-0783) could be clearly observed (Fig. S3†), except the diffraction peaks of the SnO2 (200) plane (JCPDS: 41-1445) at 37.94° and the hematite (110) plane at 35.61° (JCPDS: 33-0664). The XPS investigations further verified the component of α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS, from which the characteristic peaks of Fe, Ag, Cd and S have all been found. As shown in Fig. 2b, two obvious XPS peaks located around 710.8 eV and 724 eV closely matched those of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2P1/2 of α-Fe2O3, respectively. The O 1s XPS peak at 529.8 eV is consistent with the typical O1s in α-Fe2O3 (Fig. 2c). By contrast, the Fe 2p2/3 and Fe 2p1/2 peaks of α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS shifted to lower binding energy relative to α-Fe2O3. This observation suggests the presence of the interaction between α-Fe2O3 with Ag and CdS. The measured binding energy of Cd 3d and S 2p peaks well correspond to the standard feature of CdS (Fig. 2d and e). In addition, the existence of Ag in α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS was evidenced by the observation of Ag 3d XPS peaks (Fig. 2f). Based on the above results, it can be concluded that the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS ternary heterojunction film was successfully prepared.

The PEC water oxidation activity of α-Fe2O3, α-Fe2O3/CdS and α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanodes was investigated using their photocurrent density–potential curves in 1.0 M NaOH. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the photocurrent density of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode is achieved 3.25 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is about 2.5 times higher relative to that of the α-Fe2O3 photoanode (1.25 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE). The α-Fe2O3/CdS photoanode has a moderate photocurrent density of 2.55 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Meanwhile, the photocurrent onset potential of α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS (∼0.41 V vs. RHE) and α-Fe2O3/CdS (∼0.50 V vs. RHE) photoanodes is obviously lower than that of the α-Fe2O3 photoanode (∼0.92 V vs. RHE). The current onset potential of the photoanode is closely related to its water oxidation kinetics, and lower current onset potential means faster water oxidation kinetics.32 The highest photocurrent and lowest onset potential on the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode suggest that the presence of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS ternary heterojunction has the function of improving the water oxidation activity and kinetics of the α-Fe2O3 photoanode.33,34Fig. 3c and d show the ABPE and IPCE of α-Fe2O3, α-Fe2O3/CdS and α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanodes, respectively. The highest ABPE of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode is 3.46% at 1.05 V vs. RHE, which is a 3-fold increase relative to the α-Fe2O3 photoanode (1.04% at 1.09 V vs. RHE). The maximum IPCE value of the three photoanodes is found at 405 nm, the maximum IPCE for the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode is 43%, 10.8% for the α-Fe2O3/CdS photoanode and 9.4% for the α-Fe2O3 photoanode. Based on their IPCE spectrum shown in Fig. 3d, the integrated photocurrent density of α-Fe2O3, α-Fe2O3/CdS and α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanodes is 3.12 mA cm−2, 2.50 mA cm−2, and 1.31 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. S4†). In general, the integrated photocurrent density of the photoanodes is very close to their photocurrent density from LSV testing shown in Fig. 3a. In other words, the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode has the highest ABPE and IPCE, which is consistent with the photocurrent investigation results in Fig. 3a and b. In addition, the linear part of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode's Mott–Schottky plots shows the slope being smaller than that of the α-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3/CdS photoanodes' Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. 3e and f). The smaller slope of the Mott–Schottky plots of the photoanode means the higher carrier density. Although there are inevitable deviations in utilization of Mott–Schottky equation, which is established for dense films not nanostructured films.35 According to the Mott–Schottky equation,37 the donor density of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode is calculated to be 4.64 × 1020 cm−3, which is higher than that of α-Fe2O3 (6.72 × 1019 cm−3) and α-Fe2O3/CdS (3.85 × 1020 cm−3) photoanodes. The flat-band potential of α-Fe2O3, α-Fe2O3/CdS and α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanodes is 0.73 V, 0.65 V and 0.60 V vs. RHE, respectively. Obviously, the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode has the lowest flat-band potential. The above results jointly indicate that the formation of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS ternary heterojunction improves the water oxidation activity and kinetics of the α-Fe2O3 photoanode.

To further confirm the enhanced water oxidation performance on the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode, the charge separation and injection efficiency of the α-Fe2O3, α-Fe2O3/CdS and α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanodes were contrastively investigated. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode has highest charge separation and injection efficiency among the α-Fe2O3, α-Fe2O3/CdS and α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanodes. It is generally accepted that photoanode with higher charge separation and injection efficiency exhibits better water oxidation activity and kinetics, respectively.38,39 Accordingly, we could know that the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode has higher water oxidation activity and faster kinetics than the α-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3/CdS photoanode. In the further electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, a direct finding about faster water oxidation kinetics on the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode was obtained. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode has the smallest semicircle arc in the Nyquist EIS plots, indicating its fastest water oxidation kinetics. The fitted equivalent circuit for the three photoanodes is shown in the inset of Fig. 4c and d, and the fitted component values are summarized in Table 1. In the equivalent circuit, Rs represents the electrolyte resistance, R1 represents the water oxidation resistance on the photoanode, and R2 reflects the charge transfer resistance at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. The R1 of the α-Fe2O3 photoanode is 214.0 Ω, while the R1 of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode is 43.4 Ω, indicating that the water oxidation kinetics on the α-Fe2O3 photoanode is significantly boosted after the coupling with Ag and CdS nanoparticles. The R2 of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode is 20.8 Ω, which is almost half of the R2 of the α-Fe2O3/CdS photoanode (38.37 Ω), revealing that the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS ternary heterojunction is better than the α-Fe2O3/CdS binary heterojunction for the charge transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. In addition, CPE1 represents the capacitance of the space charge region of the photoanode and CPE2 is the transmission capacitance between the photoanode and electrolyte.40 As can be seen from Table 1, the CPE1 value of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode is higher than that of the α-Fe2O3/CdS photoanode, but the CPE2 value of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode is lower. The capacitance of the photoanode represents its performance to hold charge (C = Q/V, C is the capacitance, Q represents the charge and V is the potential). The higher CPE1 value of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode means its higher space charge region, and its lower CPE2 originates from the change of voltage or charge distribution caused by the relatively high Ag/CdS overlayer.41 Therefore, the EIS result is consistent with the other PEC results that confirm the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS ternary heterojunction photoanode having higher water oxidation performance. From the above PEC investigation results, it is certain that the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS ternary heterojunction photoanode has higher water oxidation performance than the α-Fe2O3 photoanode and the α-Fe2O3/CdS binary heterojunction photoanode.

To understand the origin of improved water oxidation performance on the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode, the UV-vis harvesting properties of α-Fe2O3, α-Fe2O3/CdS and α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS films were investigated. Fig. 5a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the three films, in which the lowest absorption intensity can be observed on the α-Fe2O3 film. By contrast, the α-Fe2O3/CdS and α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS films have enhanced absorption intensity, particularly the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS film. Additionally, the absorption band edge of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS film is extended to 620 nm, while the absorption band edge of the α-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3/CdS film is around 580 and 600 nm, respectively. This observation suggests that α-Fe2O3 coupling with CdS and Ag enhances its light absorption intensity, which can be attributed to the α-Fe2O3/CdS heterojunction effect and the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of the Ag nanoparticles.42,43 In the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS film, a detailed feature is worthy of attention. Namely, a small bulge of absorption appeared between 500 and 550 nm, which could be attributed to the typical SPR effect of the Ag nanoparticles on the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS film.44 Based on the UV-vis absorbance spectra, the band gap of α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS, α-Fe2O3/CdS and α-Fe2O3 films is found to be 2.04 eV, 2.08 eV and 2.06 eV, respectively (Fig. 5b). The band gap difference between these α-Fe2O3-based films is very tiny. Fig. 5c shows the difference in the open-circuit potential (OCP) of α-Fe2O3, α-Fe2O3/CdS and α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanodes under dark and under illumination conditions. The OCP variation of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode under dark and illumination conditions is 200 mV, while that of the α-Fe2O3 photoanode is 90 mV and that of the α-Fe2O3/CdS photoanode is 170 mV. It is apparent that the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode has the highest value of OCP variation, indicating that the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode has the highest efficiency in charge separation and transfer due to the presence of the ternary heterojunction. A similar result was also observed from the photoluminescence (PL) spectral investigation of the three films. As shown in Fig. 5d, the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS film exhibits lower PL intensity than the α-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3/CdS films, suggesting its lower radiative recombination of carriers. In principle, the water oxidation on the photoanode involves kinetic processes in addition to the above light harvesting as well as charge separation and transfer processes. For further understanding the kinetic difference on α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS, the electrochemical water oxidation of the three film electrodes was investigated under dark conditions. As shown in Fig. 5e, the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS electrode in 0.5 M Na2SO4 shows the highest activity and lowest overpotential during electrochemical water oxidation compared to the α-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3/CdS electrodes. The Tafel slope of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS electrode is 60.1 mV dec−1, significantly lower than α-Fe2O3/CdS (91.0 mV dec−1) and α-Fe2O3 (95.7 mV dec−1) (Fig. 5f), indicating the highest water oxidation activity. The above findings reveal that the presence of Ag nanoparticles on the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS film could boost its electrocatalytic kinetics for water oxidation, which should be an important factor that results in the faster PEC water oxidation kinetics on the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode. To further reveal the role of Ag in the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS ternary heterojunction photoanode, we tested the charge separation efficiency of the α-Fe2O3/Ag photoanode (Fig. S5†). A higher charge separation efficiency was observed on the α-Fe2O3/Ag photoanode relative to the α-Fe2O3/CdS and α-Fe2O3 photoanode. This observation indicates that the presence of Ag nanoparticles can effectively improve the charge–hole separation of α-Fe2O3. Further UV-vis absorbance investigation shows that the presence of Ag nanoparticles can enhance the light absorption intensity of the α-Fe2O3 film. Accordingly, it could be known that the presence of Ag nanoparticles enlarges the absorption edge of α-Fe2O3/CdS and improves the electron–hole separation through their surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect.

Summarizing all of the above investigations, the better water oxidation activity and kinetics of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode could be ascribed to the following reasons. Firstly, due to the presence of the SPR effect from Ag nanoparticles, the production of photogenerated electrons and holes in the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode is more than those in α-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3/CdS photoanodes. Furthermore, the formation of the α-Fe2O3/CdS heterojunction could drive the photogenerated electron and hole separation and transfer directionally through their favorable band potential differences (see Fig. 5g). Since the valence band potential of α-Fe2O3 (∼2.48 V vs. NHE) is higher than that of CdS (∼1.88 V vs. NHE),45–47 the photogenerated holes of α-Fe2O3 can be transferred to CdS. In contrast, the photogenerated electrons of CdS can be transferred to α-Fe2O3 owing to their conduction band potential difference. As a result, higher water oxidation activity can be achieved on the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode. Meanwhile, the Ag nanoparticles exhibit electrocatalytic activity for water oxidation, which could jointly initiate the water oxidation on the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode, and thus results in its faster kinetics.
The water oxidation stability of the resultant α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode can be well maintained with the protection of the amorphous TiO2 layer. The amorphous titanium oxide layer was proved to be a useful protective layer to avoid the photocorrosion of the photoanodes as much as possible.48,49Fig. 6a shows the photocurrent density changes of α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS and α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS/TiO2 photoanodes at 1.23 V vs. RHE within 10 h under AM 1.5G irradiation in 1.0 M NaOH. In general, better stability was observed for the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS/TiO2 photoanode. The initial photocurrent density for the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode is 3.25 mA cm−2, but only 59% activity remained after 10 h of reaction due to the photocorrosion of CdS. With the protection of the amorphous TiO2 layer, the photocurrent density of α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS/TiO2 maintains 80% of its initial photocurrent density after 10 h testing (Fig. S6†). The comparative SEM, HRTEM and XPS investigations for the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS/TiO2 photoanode before and after stability testing are shown in Fig. S7 and S8.† The morphology of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS/TiO2 photoanode did not change significantly after 10 h stability testing. In addition, HRTEM investigation indicated that the amorphous TiO2 layer also did not change. A similar result was found in the XPS investigations that the chemical states of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS/TiO2 photoanode after stability testing were almost the same as before testing. The above observations solidly proved that the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode with an amorphous TiO2 layer has good stability for solar water splitting.

Conclusions
In summary, an α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS ternary heterojunction film was designed and investigated as a photoanode for solar water oxidation. Since the resultant α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode takes full advantage of its ternary heterojunction, higher water oxidation activity and faster kinetics can be achieved on the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode relative to the α-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3/CdS photoanode. Specifically, the formation of α-Fe2O3/CdS heterojunctions improves the charge transfer and separation of α-Fe2O3 through their favorable band potential differences. Meanwhile, the presence of Ag nanoparticles enlarges the absorption edge of α-Fe2O3/CdS and decreases the electron–hole recombination through the surface plasmon resonance effect. In addition, the electrocatalytic properties of Ag nanoparticles can initiate the water oxidation on the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode jointly. With the protection of the amorphous TiO2 layer, the water oxidation activity of the α-Fe2O3/Ag/CdS photoanode can be steadily maintained even after 10 h of reaction at 1.23 V vs. RHE.
