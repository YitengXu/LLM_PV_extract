This has allowed the preparation of electrolytes with high Seebeck coefficients, Se = 1.5–2.2 mV K−1, and thereby excellent prospects for thermal harvesting. The unique physical properties of ionic liquids offer ideal characteristics for their use as electrolytes in thermoelectrochemical cells, particularly for applications involving thermal energy available at temperatures in the 100–200 °C range. The power generation characteristics of thermoelectrochemical cells using a series of ionic liquids and MPN with the CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 couple are described. Power densities reached >0.5 W m−2 in unoptimized devices, operating with a 130 °C hot side. The high Seebeck coefficient appears to have its origins in the high-to-low spin transition upon electron transfer in this cobalt complex.Broader contextThe utilization of waste heat, such as is produced in industrial processes or in geothermal activity, is an attractive route to relieving some of our present reliance on fossil fuels. Devices that allow the direct conversion of thermal energy to electrical energy, with a flexible design and no carbon emissions, will have wide-spread utility, e.g. the in situ generation of electricity to off-set local power demands. Complementary to the progress towards semiconductor-based thermoelectric devices for high temperature applications, ionic liquid-based thermoelectrochemical devices offer the possibility of cheap and flexible device design suitable for harvesting waste heat in the 100–200 °C range. The use of ionic liquid electrolytes, which can have negligible volatility and good thermal and electrochemical stability, will eliminate any problem of evaporation from the device with long-term use. They also increase the temperatures that can be harvested compared to traditional aqueous-based devices. One of the keys to utilizing these new media in efficient thermoelectrochemical cells is achieving high Seebeck coefficients: the magnitude of the voltage achieved per unit temperature difference. Here we demonstrate the highest reported Seebeck coefficients and power outputs to-date for ionic liquid-based thermoelectrochemical cells by utilizing a high entropy change cobalt redox couple.IntroductionThermal energy is an attractive energy source given its abundance and accessibility in the form of geothermal sources and also “waste heat” from power stations and engines. Research into converting thermal to electrical energy has, until recently, predominantly been focused on solid-state devices utilising p- and n-type semiconductor materials.1,2 The focus has been on creating materials with the highest possible thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT = Se2Tσ/κ, where T is the absolute temperature, Se is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical (or ionic) conductivity and κ is the thermal conductivity.3 To date, superlattice nanostructured materials have resulted in the highest values of ZT (2.2 at 900 K) and Se values at <200 °C of around 0.1–0.2 mV K−1.2 In semiconducting material devices it can be difficult to overcome the interplay between thermal and electrical conductivity. There is also increased interest in polymer-based thermoelectric devices, which currently have a maximum ZT of ca. 0.1, and Se ≤ 1 mV K−1.4 These limitations have stimulated interest in alternative approaches to thermoelectric materials.Liquid-based thermoelectrochemical technologies offer an alternative, potentially cheaper and more scalable route for direct thermal-to-electric energy conversion with no carbon emissions. These devices utilize a redox couple within an electrolyte, and it is the temperature dependence of the redox potential that creates a potential difference across the cell when a temperature gradient exists. This temperature dependence is related to the entropy difference for a given redox couple: ∂E(T)/∂T = Se = ΔS°rc/nF(1)where n is the number of electrons involved in the reaction and F is Faraday's constant See ESI†).5–7The choice of solvent is an important parameter influencing the thermodynamics and kinetics of electron transfer reactions.7–10 Until recently, research into thermoelectrochemical devices has been dominated by use of aqueous electrolytes,11 and a small number of organic solvents.12,13 The benchmark electrolyte is aqueous 0.4 M ferri/ferrocyanide, which has an Se of −1.4 mV K−1 and ΔS°rc of −135.1 J K−1 mol−1,6,11,14,15 and adjustments to the device orientation and the nature of the electrode can improve overall power output.6,11,14,15 Baughman et al.6 have reported maximum power outputs of 1.8 W m−2 for an aqueous based device with high surface area electrodes of multiwalled carbon nanotube buckypaper scrolls. However, the volatility and boiling point of water and most organic solvents limits the upper range of accessible temperatures, restricting the power outputs that can be achieved (by restricting ΔT) and likely limiting long-term durability.Ionic liquids are molten salts with melting points below 100 °C,16 and they provide significant advantages over aqueous systems for thermoelectrochemical cells, particularly those ILs with negligible volatility and good thermal stability. IL-based thermoelectrochemical devices allow access to high temperature heat sources and address the problem of solvent evaporation during long-term use. We have recently reported the Seebeck coefficients of the I−/I3− redox couple in a series of ILs,10 while Migita et al.17 have studied the Se values of a series of iron complexes, and Cr(bpy)3, in the IL 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide.Liquid-based thermoelectrochemical cells can be limited by both the diffusion and concentration of the redox species. Thus, optimization of both the transport (D) and the thermodynamics (Se) of the system are important for the development of thermoelectrochemical cells. The thermal conductivity of the electrolyte, κ, should be as low as possible, and this also helps to maintain large temperature differences, ΔT.The key requirement for the development of thermoelectrochemical cells is a redox electrolyte with a high Seebeck coefficient. This is directly related to the entropy difference associated with the redox reaction, ΔS°rc, and there are a multitude of factors that can affect this parameter. The ΔS°rc for transition metal complexes has previously been examined in a range of aqueous and organic solvents.7,8,18 Transition metal redox couples have both inner-shell (metal–ligand reorganization) and outer-shell (solvent reorganization) entropy changes that contribute to the total ΔS°rc.8 The nature of the ligands surrounding the metal centre affects ΔS°rc, even for couples of the same charge and comparable size. The nature of the metal is also influential as the change in electronic structure that accompanies the addition of an electron can vary. For example, higher ΔS°rc values exist in the CoII/III(bpy)3 couple compared to the equivalent Fe or Ru complexes as a result of a low to high spin transition upon reduction. This transition produces a greater change in metal–ligand bond length as a result of the added electron. The location of the added electron into the eg electronic level for the CoII/III(bpy)3 couple, rather than into the t2g level, is believed to result in less delocalization of this electron around the bipyridyl ligands and thus a greater disruption of the solvent structure.7,8 Bipyridyl is also an ideal ligand for use of this metal redox couple as this complex exhibits good electrochemically reversibility in electrochemical cells.19 Cobalt(II/III) redox couples have also recently drawn attention as replacements for the corrosive iodide/triiodide redox couple in dye-sensitized solar cells.19–21Here we demonstrate the first use of a CoII/III redox couple in IL electrolytes for thermoelectrochemical cells. The high ΔS°rc of this redox couple produces the largest Seebeck coefficients reported to date in ILs. The diffusion rate of the redox couple in different ILs, and the thermal conductivities of the electrolytes, have also been examined as these are key parameters dictating the device performance. The power generation characteristics of thermoelectrochemical cells utilising the optimum ILs were measured as a function of redox couple concentration, temperature differences, and using both platinum and platinum black electrodes. Operating temperatures above 100 °C were targeted, to demonstrate the practical energy harvesting advantages of ILs over aqueous systems.ExperimentalSeebeck coefficient measurementsSe values were measured using a non-isothermal cells, as described in our previous work.10Diffusion coefficient measurementsD values were measured by cyclic voltammetry by measuring the limiting current under conditions of near steady-state behaviour at different temperatures.22 Ilim = 4nFDrc(2)A three-electrode cell with platinum working, counter and reference electrodes was used. Platinum wire was coiled to provide a large surface area counter electrode, while the reference electrode was uncoiled platinum wire. The working electrode was a platinum microelectrode with a radius of 5 micrometers. The current was monitored between −0.5 V and +0.5 V at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1.Thermal conductivity measurementsThermal conductivities were measured using a C-Therm TCi thermal conductivity analyzer at different temperatures: 80 °C, 95 °C, 110 °C and 130 °C.Ionic liquids synthesisIonic liquids 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) amide, [C2mim][NTf2], and 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) amide, [C4mpyr][NTf2] were synthesised following literature procedures23 (see ESI†).

Two platinum disk electrodes (18 mm diameter) were separated by a 12 mm cylindrical insert, with the 9 mm internal diameter representing the active electrode area. The insert was designed with a groove to hold ceramic Pt thermocouples that rested against each electrode. This assures accurate measurements of ΔT between the electrodes. Heaters were attached to the backside of the electrodes and controlled using a custom-made temperature controller connected to a power supply and the thermocouples. The electrolyte was injected into the cylinder by syringe/pipette. The cell was placed in a dry ice environment and the two electrodes were heated independently to produce the desired ΔT. Using Ohm's law (I = V/R) and Joule's Law (P = I2R = V2/R), by applying known resistances and measuring the potential, one can calculate the current and the output power of the thermoelectrochemical cell.6 The maximum output power was obtained by fitting the data (R2 > 0.97) to a quadratic function and determining the local maximum.Results and discussionSynthesis of salts of the CoII/III(bpy)3 complex in combination with perchlorate, tetracyanoborate and hexafluorophosphate anions has been reported.19,20,24 However, CoII/III(bpy)3(PF6)2/3 showed poor solubility in the ILs tested, and appeared to be unstable in air. Therefore, to improve the solubility and stability of the redox couple in ILs the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide salts were synthesised. This CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 redox couple was stable in air and the solubility in ILs significantly improved, up to 0.1 M for some of the ILs tested. A cyclic voltammetry study of 0.01 M CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 in [C2mim][NTf2] was carried out (Fig. 1) and showed good electrochemical reversibility on a Pt electrode. Fig. 1  Cyclic voltammogram (vs. a Pt pseudo reference electrode; 20 mV s−1 scan rate) of 0.01 M CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 in [C2mim][NTf2] after Se measurement. Fig. 2 presents the measured potential differences as a function of the temperature gradient, in all cases with the cold electrode held at room temperature. Good linearity was observed and therefore the slope of these lines indicates constant values of the Seebeck coefficient over this temperature range. In Table 1 these Seebeck coefficients are listed for various concentrations of the redox couple, along with the calculated redox reaction entropy changes. ILs with the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cation and the CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 couple produced a higher Se than with 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cation based ILs. With the same cation, the eFAP anion gave higher Se values than the NTf2− and the B(CN)4− anions. Thus the Se and ΔS°rc values associated with the electron transfer in the CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 couple varied with both the nature of the cation and the anion of the IL.

Since MPN, [C2mim][NTf2], [C2mim][B(CN)4], and [C2mim][eFAP] with CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 produced the highest Se values, these four electrolytes were utilised in the further development of the full devices.The Se of this redox couple in the different ILs and MPN ranged from 1.40 to 2.19 mV K−1, exceeding that of the iodide/triiodide in IL systems we have reported previously,10 and higher than those of the low-spin iron and chromium complexes in ILs.17 These Se values also surpass that of the standard 0.4 M ferri/ferrocyanide in water, that has an Se of −1.4 mV K−1.25 The ΔS°rc for the CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 couple ranged from 135 to 211 J K−1 mol−1 (Table 1). These considerable Se and ΔS°rc values are consistent with the hypothesis of significant electronic, vibrational and solvent reorganisation as a result of the low spin to high spin transition in this complex upon reduction.8 The relatively high charge on the couple (II/III) also contributes to a high ΔS°rc.17 Unlike the I−/I3− in IL systems,10 the concentration of the redox couple had only a minor effect on Se values for the CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 in ILs. On the other hand, in MPN the Se increased with decreasing concentration, consistent with the literature on aqueous ferri/ferrocyanide systems.13,25The diffusion rate for the CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 redox couple was measured at 80 °C, 95 °C and 110 °C (the average cell temperatures when using device Thot/Tcold of 130 °C/30 °C, 130 °C/60 °C and 130 °C/90 °C, respectively). The rates of diffusion of 0.1 M CoII/III(bpy)3 in MPN were faster than in the IL electrolytes. The diffusion rate of CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 in the ILs increases significantly with temperature and concentration, which is an important consideration for the application of these systems: IL-based redox electrolytes that display diffusion limitations at low temperatures could be targeted towards higher temperature heat sources, where both electrodes are at above-ambient temperatures.The thermal conductivities of [C2mim][NTf2], 0.12 W K−1 m−1,26 and of MPN, 0.12 W K−1 m−1,27 are reported in the literature. These decrease with increasing temperature,26,27 which is advantageous for thermoelectrochemical applications. [C2mim][eFAP] is corrosive and thus could not be measured. The thermal conductivity of [C2mim][B(CN)4] was measured at 80 °C, 95 °C, 110 °C and 130 °C and were found to be unchanged with temperature (within the uncertainty of the measurement) at 0.19 W K−1 m−1. The addition of the CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 redox couple to [C2mim][B(CN)4] also produced no significant change in the thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivities of all of the electrolytes are considerably lower than water over the temperature range studied, 0.67 W K−1 m−1.27,28 A low thermal conductivity is beneficial for thermoelectrochemical cell performance as it increases the ΔT that can be maintained across the device and also the energy efficiency of the device at any given ΔT.Fig. 4 shows the output power of the thermoelectrochemical cells, with platinum electrodes, using [C2mim][B(CN)4] and two different concentrations of the CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 redox couple. The concentration dependence of the device behaviour for the cells utilising [C2mim][NTf2], [C2mim][eFAP] and MPN is shown in Fig. S1–S5 in the ESI.† The power curves exhibit the expected Joule's Law parabolic curvature, with a Pmax being evident in each case and obtained by curve fitting to the data. For the electrolytes used in this study, the maximum power densities were observed at the highest concentration (0.1 M) electrolyte solutions. The performance of the thermoelectrochemical device appears to be restricted at the lower electrolyte concentrations due to diffusion limitations.14The performance of the CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 in IL electrolytes was also tested in a thermoelectrochemical cell with three values of ΔT: Thot/Tcold = 130 °C/30 °C, 130 °C/60 °C and 130 °C/90 °C. These variations in Thot/Tcold allow investigation of the influence of diffusion rate and ΔT on the ultimate power outputs (Table 2, Fig. 5). For the MPN system the ΔT of 130 °C/30 °C could not be maintained, probably as a result of greater convection in this very fluid electrolyte, and therefore this was studied at Thot/Tcold = 130 °C/60 °C, 130 °C/70 °C and 130 °C/90 °C (Table 2, Fig. 5D).

For comparison similar cells were prepared with the I−/I3− redox couple, as described by us previously;10 these produced 29 mW m−2 at ΔT of 100 °C. This is a significantly lower power output than that achieved here with the cobalt redox couple, which is consistent with the larger Seebeck coefficients. It is evident from the thermoelectrochemical cell power output data that there is no single ΔT value that is optimal for all of the electrolytes studied. This reflects the differences in diffusion rates and temperature dependence in the electrolytes; increasing Tcold will only improve output power if the system is dominated by mass transport effects at Tcold. In other systems an increase in Tcold, and the associated decrease in ΔT, will reduce power output. Thus, the device utilising the [C2mim][B(CN)4] electrolyte appears diffusion limited at Tcold = 30 °C, while the MPN and [C2mim][NTf2] systems exhibit their maximum power output at greatest ΔT (Table 2, Fig. 5). This is consistent with the observed trends in diffusion coefficients of the different electrolytes (Fig. 3). Fig. 3  Temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficients of 0.1 M CoII(bpy)3(NTf2)2 (A) and CoIII(bpy)3(NTf2)3 (B) electrolytes:  MPN,  [C2mim][eFAP],  [C2mim][NTf2],  [C2mim][B(CN)4].  Fig. 4  Thermoelectrochemical cell power (A) and current (B) vs. potential plots using 0.1 M (solid line) and 0.05 M (dashed line) CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 in [C2mim][B(CN)4]. (Thot (°C)/Tcold (°C):  130/30;  130/60;  130/90). Investigating the relationship between the current and the potential of electrochemical devices provides important further insight into the factors limiting their performance. A typical electrochemical device can exhibit a range of overpotentials (activation, mass transport and ohmic) that cause deviation from the ideal “rectangular shaped” current–voltage curve.11 In the thermoelectrochemical devices tested, mass transport related overpotentials of the electrolyte appear to dominate, as shown by the linear portion of the I–E curve.11 In all of the devices, the gradient of this line increases with temperature, consistent with a decreased mass transport resistance. In the [C2mim][B(CN)4] system, the highest current and power densities are obtained at 130 °C/60 °C. This indicates that diffusion limitations exist at Tcold = 30 °C, but when Tcold = 90 °C the disadvantage of a smaller ΔT outweighs any advantage gained from higher diffusion coefficients and thus a smaller power output is observed (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5  Power vs. potential (solid line) and current vs. potential (dotted line) plots from thermoelectrochemical devices utilising platinum electrodes and 0.1 M CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 in [C2mim][B(CN)4] (A), [C2mim][NTf2] (B) and [C2mim][eFAP] (C) at three temperature differences: Thot (°C)/Tcold (°C):  130/30;  130/60;  130/90; and 0.1 M CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 in MPN (D), Thot (°C)/Tcold (°C):  130/60;  130/70;  130/90. The thermoelectrochemical cell utilising [C2mim][B(CN)4] produces the highest currents of all the IL systems tested, as a result of the higher diffusion coefficients (Fig. 3). Similarly, the much higher diffusion coefficients of the redox couple in MPN compared to the ILs enables nearly twice the current densities: 8.3 A m−2 for MPN compared to 4.5 A m−2 for [C2mim][B(CN)4]. The slower diffusion coefficients of CoII/III(bpy)3 in [C2mim][NTf2] and [C2mim][eFAP] resulted in the lowest current densities. It is clear from the different power outputs and current–voltage curves for the electrolytes, and their different temperature behaviour, that there is interplay of many different factors influencing the overall performance of the device.Another strategy for increasing the performance of the thermoelectrochemical cells, in addition to addressing the diffusion limitations, is to increase the internal surface area of the electrodes. Baughman et al.6,14 have demonstrated that high surface area carbon nanotube electrodes perform better than platinum in aqueous thermoelectrochemical systems. To increase the surface area of our platinum disc electrodes, platinum black was electrodeposited onto the surface. This produced a notable increase in power output: from 499 to 522 mW m−2 for the MPN-based device and from 183 to 240 mW m−2 for [C2mim][B(CN)4]. The current densities were also improved with the higher surface area electrodes (Fig. 6). Although these power outputs are not as high as those reported by Baughman et al.6 it is important to note that the operating temperatures of the IL-based devices described here are significantly higher than water based systems, thus increasing their range of applications. The use of carbon and conducting polymer-based electrocatalysts is now being investigated, to further optimize these devices. Structural variations to the ligands and the counter anions of the cobalt redox couple are also in progress, to improve solubility and further address any diffusion limitations.

ConclusionsThermoelectrochemical cells utilising the CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 redox couple in ILs or a high boiling organic solvent show significant promise for the harvesting of thermal energy that cannot be accessed using standard aqueous-based systems. This redox couple displays a high reaction entropy, as a result of a high/low spin transition, which results in the highest reported Seebeck coefficients to date for IL-based systems: Se = 1.5–1.9 mV K−1. The output powers and current–voltage characteristics for thermoelectrochemical cells utilising a series of IL and MPN electrolytes with the CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 couple and either Pt or Pt black-coated electrodes were analysed and the influence of temperature assessed. The top performing redox electrolytes were 0.1 M CoII/III(bpy)3(NTf2)2/3 in MPN and in [C2mim][B(CN)4], utilised with Pt black-coated electrodes, which yielded output powers of 522 mW m−2 and 240 mW m−2 respectively. Diffusion limitations present in these devices can be alleviated by increasing the operating temperature; the good thermal stability, negligible volatility and low thermal conductivity of ILs makes them ideal electrolytes for such higher-temperature energy harvesting applications.AcknowledgementsThe authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the Australian Research Council through its Centre of Excellence program, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and also for fellowship support for D.

Broader contextThe utilization of waste heat, such as is produced in industrial processes or in geothermal activity, is an attractive route to relieving some of our present reliance on fossil fuels. Devices that allow the direct conversion of thermal energy to electrical energy, with a flexible design and no carbon emissions, will have wide-spread utility, e.g. the in situ generation of electricity to off-set local power demands. Complementary to the progress towards semiconductor-based thermoelectric devices for high temperature applications, ionic liquid-based thermoelectrochemical devices offer the possibility of cheap and flexible device design suitable for harvesting waste heat in the 100–200 °C range. The use of ionic liquid electrolytes, which can have negligible volatility and good thermal and electrochemical stability, will eliminate any problem of evaporation from the device with long-term use. They also increase the temperatures that can be harvested compared to traditional aqueous-based devices. One of the keys to utilizing these new media in efficient thermoelectrochemical cells is achieving high Seebeck coefficients: the magnitude of the voltage achieved per unit temperature difference. Here we demonstrate the highest reported Seebeck coefficients and power outputs to-date for ionic liquid-based thermoelectrochemical cells by utilizing a high entropy change cobalt redox couple.
