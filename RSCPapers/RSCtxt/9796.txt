    , Accepted 20th June 2017First published on 20th June 2017AbstractOrganometallic halide perovskite quantum dots (OHP-QDs) have attracted a great deal of attention because of their high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs, up to 90%) and narrow-band colors. However, precise control of the OHP-QDs' size is difficult and they are unstable under ambient conditions, which limits their usage in applications such as lasers and displays. Herein, we introduce a novel method to prepare size-controllable and stable OHP (methylammonium lead trihalide, MAPbX3, where X = Cl, Br, and I)-QDs/polymer films using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as a template. The MAPbX3 QDs/PDMS films developed in this work are self-standing, flexible, transparent, and retain the photophysical properties of OHP-QDs for at least several months. Moreover, the uniform size of the OHP-QDs results in narrow photoluminescence (PL) emission (full-width-at-half-maximum, FWHM ≈ 20 nm) compared to that of QDs synthesized by a conventional method (≈50 nm). The PL emission peak can be shifted by varying the size of the QDs and also by changing the halide component (Cl, Br, and I), covering a wide range of absorption wavelengths. Furthermore, the higher PL intensity of the larger QDs was confirmed by time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) experiments.
Organometallic halide perovskite (OHP) materials have recently attracted much attention, mainly due to their rapid advances in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for solar cells, which rose from 3.8% to over 20% within 6 years.1–6 OHP materials can also be used in light emitting diodes (LEDs) because of their superior optical properties and ease of fabrication.7–11 Previous studies have focused on enhancing the PCEs of solar cells through the control of grain size,12,13 grain boundary passivation,14 and the cation/halide composition of the perovskite bulk film.15,16 However, this focus has now been directed to the fabrication of perovskites as quantum dots (QDs) rather than bulk films to enhance their photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), since the confinement of holes and electrons in QDs promotes radiative recombination. In recent studies, the PLQYs of methylammonium lead tribromide (MAPbBr3) QDs have been enhanced by varying their halide composition, controlling their size, and synthesizing them as core–shell structures.17–19 Although previous studies have demonstrated PLQYs for MAPbBr3 QDs as high as 93%, their stability was limited to about 1 month. Also, precise control of the perovskite QD size is quite challenging compared to other types of nanoparticles (e.g., metals, semiconductors, etc.).20,21 OHP-QDs synthesized by the conventional solution-state ligand-assisted re-precipitation (LARP) method, which uses capping ligands to passivate the surface of the OHP-QDs, show some disadvantages such as their broad size distributions and limited stabilities. To enhance the stabilities of semiconductor QDs, composite films of polymer-encapsulated QDs (QDs/polymers) have been used.22–25 However, the conventional preparation method in which semiconductor QDs are simply blended with the polymer often results in aggregation of semiconductor QDs within the polymer matrix and/or degeneration of their optical properties (e.g., PLQYs).22,23 Recently, Kovalenko et al. synthesized perovskite nanocrystals using mesoporous silica matrices as templates,26 which could resolve the above-mentioned issues. However, the way to grow perovskite nanocrystals uniformly within the template requires further optimization.
Herein, we report the preparation of OHP-QDs/PDMS films using a polymer template with precise control of the QD size, enhanced stability, and retention of their photophysical properties. As shown in Fig. 1a, the OHP (MAPbX3, where X = Cl, Br, and I)-QDs/PDMS films were prepared by using porous PDMS (p-PDMS) as a template for perovskite crystal growth (details are provided in the Experimental section in the ESI†). In this approach, a film consisting of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and PDMS was initially prepared by blending prepurified AuNPs with the PDMS prepolymer. The absorption spectrum of the AuNP/PDMS film is similar to that of AuNPs in toluene (Fig. 1b), which indicates that no aggregation of AuNPs occurs in the PDMS film. Then, AuNPs within the composite film are selectively etched by aqua regia (a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid in a 1:3 molar ratio, <42%), resulting in the p-PDMS template for perovskite crystal growth. To ensure the etching and washing processes, the composite film was swollen in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The absorption peak due to the AuNPs at 525 nm disappeared at this stage (Fig. 1b). Next, MAPbX3 QDs were grown in the pores that were previously occupied by AuNPs. The p-PDMS template was immersed in the perovskite precursor solution (1.0 M of methylammonium halide and lead halide in either anhydrous DMF or 1:1 v/v DMF:DMSO).27 To ensure full growth of the OHP-QDs within the pores of the p-PDMS template, we repeated the immersing process several times in the final growth step. Of note, the issues of low concentrations (≈0.5 mg mL−1) of the OHP-QD suspensions17,18 can be resolved using the polymer template since the concentration of OHP-QDs can be easily controlled by adjusting the number of AuNPs. In a conventional synthesis without capping ligands, a bulk-sized perovskite is synthesized as a consequence of Ostwald ripening. When the capping ligands are used in the synthesis, the QDs gradually aggregate or degrade, which results in decreased PLQYs.17,18 However, using the PDMS template-based method, each OHP-QD is isolated within the polymer so that aggregation is prevented and also the stability of the OHP-QDs is enhanced since PDMS blocks direct contact with the ambient environment.

(c) Absorption (solid lines) and PL spectra (dashed lines) of MAPbCl3 QDs/PDMS (black), MAPbI3 QDs/PDMS (dark green), and MAPbBr3 QDs/PDMS (dark red) films. 
Moreover, the PDMS matrix enables the OHP-QDs to maintain their individual photophysical properties since it is optically transparent. The colors of MAPbX3 QDs/PDMS films change from transparent to white (X = Cl), yellow-green (X = Br), or brown (X = I), with the photoluminescence (PL) peak maxima at 424, 528, or 738 nm, respectively (Fig. 1c). Of note, the absorption peaks of the OHP-QDs in PDMS are blue shifted by about 25 nm compared to those of the bulk materials.27,28 The blue shift of the absorption results from the increase in the optical bandgap of the OHP-QDs, because the quantum-confinement effect increases as the size decreases. However, the OHP-QDs/PDMS films of both MAPbI3 QDs and MAPbCl3 QDs were quite unstable under ambient conditions, and were decolorized almost immediately after preparation. In general, MAPbX3 perovskite materials tend to form a cubic structure (tolerance factor of ∼0.9) which is the most stable form. However, other crystalline structures can be found for perovskite materials, depending on the preparation methods, which are less stable compared to the cubic structure.29 Using our PDMS template-based method, it seems that the cubic structure of perovskite materials is not synthesized and/or lost in the case of MAPbCl3 and MAPbI3. Furthermore, in the case of MAPbI3, the heat inside the perovskite material cannot spread out rapidly due to its low thermal conductivity which can cause mechanical stress and limited stabilities.30 Therefore, we performed further analyses with the MAPbBr3 QDs/PDMS film, which was the most stable among the films.
The crystalline structure of the MAPbBr3 QDs within the OHP-QDs/PDMS film was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of pure PDMS (blue), the MAPbBr3 single crystal prepared by a previously reported method27 (orange), the as-prepared MAPbBr3 QDs/PDMS film (yellow), and the MAPbBr3 QD/PDMS film aged for several months under ambient conditions (dark green). The diffraction peaks of the MAPbBr3 QDs/PDMS film at 15.0°, 21.3°, 30.2°, 33.9°, 37.3°, 43.3° and 45.9° can be indexed to the (100), (110), (200), (210), (112), (220), and (300) planes, respectively. These planes correspond to the cubic phase for the MAPbBr3 perovskite, and are consistent with the previously reported values.31,32 Of note, the MAPbBr3 QDs/PDMS film showed the same XRD pattern and also retained its yellow-green color after several months as presented in Fig. 2b. Thus, we can conclude that the MAPbBr3 QDs maintain their original structure over several months. For further structural analysis, the MAPbBr3 QDs/PDMS film was imaged by confocal luminescence microscopy, as shown in Fig. 2c. Using this technique, the PL of the OHP-QDs within the prepared film was detected at 530 nm after photoexcitation at 488 nm. These photophysical and structural studies indicate that the OHP-QDs were synthesized within the well-separated nanoscale pores of the p-PDMS template without further aggregation.

To demonstrate the size control of MAPbBr3 QDs within the OHP-QDs/PDMS film, three sizes of AuNPs were synthesized prior to the growth of the MAPbBr3 QDs (Fig. 3a–c). Of note, precise control of the QD size by the conventional LARP method is known to be quite difficult (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). Using our method, different sizes of MAPbBr3 QDs within the PDMS were prepared by the growth of MAPbBr3 within the pores created by different sizes of AuNPs (5.6, 7.8, and 9.8 nm). As shown in Fig. 3b, the smaller the AuNPs, the greater the blue shift of the absorption peak of the MAPbBr3 QDs/PDMS film: the peak maxima were observed at 490, 500, and 510 nm for the MAPbBr3 QDs prepared with AuNP sizes of 5.6 (D1), 7.8 (D2), and 9.8 nm (D3), respectively. Also, each MAPbBr3 QDs/PDMS film exhibited a green emission with a PL peak position centered at 524, 528, and 532 nm for the MAPbBr3 QDs prepared with AuNP sizes of 5.6 (D1), 7.8 (D2), and 9.8 nm (D3), respectively. This trend is similar to that of the optical absorption: the PL peak shifts to a shorter wavelength as the size of the MAPbBr3 QDs becomes smaller. Based on these photophysical results, we can assume that the smaller OHP-QDs were grown in the pores of the p-PDMS as smaller AuNPs were used in the first step. The PL peaks are also quite narrow, with an FWHM value of ∼20 nm, indicating that the sizes of the OHP-QDs in the films are comparatively uniform compared with those of the OHP-QDs in solution (∼50 nm). In summary, the size of the MAPbBr3 QDs in the PDMS film can be precisely and easily controlled by altering the size of AuNPs. It should also be noted that the optical properties of the MAPbBr3 QDs in these films are in good agreement with those observed for solution-state OHP-QDs synthesized by the conventional LARP strategy using capping ligands.

The dark green, orange, and red lines correspond to D1, D2 and D3, respectively. (e) Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements of three different sizes of MAPbBr3 QDs in the PDMS films. 
To confirm the size effect on the photoexcited carrier dynamics of MAPbBr3 QDs, we conducted time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) experiments with excitation at 400 nm for three different sized MAPbBr3 QDs in PDMS. The decay profiles exhibit bi-exponential functions which involve fast and slow components. We observed that fast decay disappeared at weak photo-excitation (<20 μJ cm−2, see Fig. S3 and Table S2 in the ESI†). Therefore, we can assign the fast time component (τ1) as a decay related to the recombination of biexcitons and the slow time component (τ2) as a decay related to the recombination of a single exciton.14,33 As shown in Fig. 3e and Table S1 (ESI†), the amplitude of τ1 (A1), which is related to the recombination of biexcitons, decreased as the diameter of the MAPbBr3 QDs increased. In addition, the amplitude of τ2 (A2), which is related to the recombination of a single exciton, increased with an increase in the size of MAPbBr3 QDs (12%, 21%, and 30% for D1, D2, and D3, respectively). Also, to compare the decay profiles depending on the size of MAPbBr3 QDs in the PDMS film, the ratio of A2 to A1 was calculated. As the size of the MAPbBr3 QDs increased, A2/A1 increased from 0.14 to 0.27 and 0.43 for D1, D2, and D3, respectively. This feature indicates that as the size of the MAPbBr3 QDs increases, the recombination of a single exciton increases relative to that of biexcitons. Furthermore, the PL intensity of the MAPbBr3 QDs/PDMS film also increased as the size of the QDs increased (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). This result corresponds to the correlation between the PL lifetime and the size of the QDs.35,36 The MAPbBr3 QDs/PDMS films showed PLQY values of 2%, 8%, and 10% for D1, D2, and D3, respectively, compared to those of the bulk film prepared by a conventional spin-coating method showing a PLQY value of about 2%.34 Of note, we have observed that the PLQYs of the MAPbBr3 QDs/PDMS films remained almost the same even after several months, which proves that our films are stable over time.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized OHP-QDs/PDMS films using p-PDMS as a template. By this method, we can not only precisely control the size of the QDs without using any capping ligand, but also enhance the stability by blocking direct contact with the ambient environment. The emission colors of the OHP-QDs could be controlled by modifying their halide compositions (Cl, Br, and I) and their size. Furthermore, the uniform size of the OHP-QDs using this method resulted in a narrow PL emission (FWHM ≈ 20 nm) and allowed us to study the PL intensity dependence on the size. The intensity can also be controlled by the concentration of QDs within the polymer which is quite difficult with solution-state QDs because of their low concentration. The OHP-QDs/PDMS films synthesized in this work are self-standing, flexible, transparent, and also stable for at least several months. The enhanced stability of our OHP-QD/polymer films compared to solution-state perovskite QDs, and the ability to precisely control their emission color will allow their application in various lighting systems, including light emitting diodes (LEDs). Furthermore, we are currently working on a strategy to utilize a conducting polymer instead of PDMS which will further expand the range of applications.
