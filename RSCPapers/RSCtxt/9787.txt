    , Accepted 18th March 2019First published on 19th March 2019AbstractThe development of high-efficiency, flexible and folding organic solar cells (OSCs) is critical for the practical applications of these cells. Herein, we demonstrated the highly flexible and folding OSCs using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) electrodes. By developing a unique gentle acid-assisted transferring and soft material (i.e., D-sorbitol)-assisted printing technology, high-performance PEDOT:PSS electrodes were obtained, showing a figure of merit (FoM) of 83, a strong adhesion (12 ± 2 N m−1) with the underlying plastic substrates, and outstanding mechanical bending. The record FoM arises from the acid modification that induces a trade-off between the optical transparency and the square resistance for the PEDOT:PSS electrodes. Moreover, the high flexibility is mostly ascribed to the soft materials that confine the PEDOT:PSS nanofibrils and are bonded strongly with the plastic substrates. As a result, the flexible OSCs yield an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.94% with the maximum value of 10.19% and retain most of the initial PCE in harsh flexing tests. Furthermore, hybrid electrodes (i.e., PEDOT:PSS-Ag nanowires and PEDOT:PSS-zinc oxide) were prepared, endowing the flexible devices with an average PCE up to 10.21% and 10.55%, respectively. This study provides a novel route to dramatically improve the PCE and mechanical flexibility of organic photovoltaics.
1. Introduction
Flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) that turn light into electricity are emerging as wearable, sustainable and environmentally friendly energy sources.1–9 The conventional OSCs with indium tin oxides (ITO) are rigid, bulky and fragile; flexible solar cells enable printable production but have wearable applications.2,5 It is envisioned that flexible OSC plastics can be attached to the object targets (e.g., phones, watches, notebooks, textiles, and clothing) and supply green energy from sunlight that is absorbed and converted into electricity without any harmful effect. Further improvements in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and flexibility are pursued for the advancement of flexible OSCs. For roll-to-roll (R2R) printing electronics, the plastic underlying the substrates (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) with a thickness of >100 μm are commonly employed.10–12 Flexible electronics fabricated on the plastic substrates differ from ultra-thin flexible devices, and they can recover the initial planar configuration in flexing. This enables more effective utilization of sunlight with less reflection, resulting in higher output power. Moreover, the flexible OSCs are not vulnerable to crack propagation, fractures and wrinkles. Thus, it is critical to fabricate mechanically robust OSCs with high efficiency for their penetration into the rigid silicon-dominated market.
The fabrication of flexible and transparent electrodes (FTEs) plays a key role in governing the OSC performance. A high-quality FTE should meet the requirements as follows: (i) high values of figure of merit (FoM) over 35;13–15 (ii) high flexibility without compromising the conductance along with low roughness;10–12,16,17 (iii) strong bonding between the FTE and its underlying substrates;18 and (iv) simple solution preparation for cost-effective production. ITO suffers from poor flexibility along with high fabrication cost, which render it unsuitable for application in flexible electronics.19,20 As an alternative of ITO, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has major advantages such as solution processing, high flexibility, and outstanding thermal stability, and it is compatible with R2R printing and blade manufacturing.21–24 However, developing a strategy to make high-FoM, flexible, and durable plastic electrodes has long been a challenge.
The FoM of PEDOT:PSS films can be improved by doping treatments (namely pre-treatments)25–28 and surface soaking treatments (namely post-treatments).21,22,24 The pre-treatments are to dope dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethylene glycol, MeOH, ionic liquid (IL), Zonyl FS300, etc., into PEDOT:PSS solutions, resulting in the formation of linear/extended-coil structures of PEDOT and better phase separation between the PEDOT and PSS chains. For instance, Bao et al. reported an innovative MeOH assisted shearing method that endowed the PEDOT:PSS films with a record FoM of 180.14 Rigid OSC devices with the sheared PEDOT:PSS electrodes and P3HT:PCBM active layers showed an efficiency of 2.84%. Notably, the formation of large-domain aggregates of PEDOT:PSS resulted in the roughness and uniformity concerns of the PEDOT:PSS electrodes,14 which were not favored to make high-efficiency OSCs. The strong acid post-treatments are able to restrain the formation of large-domain aggregates and to improve the film conductivity.21,22 For instance, Song et al. developed a room-temperature acid soaking treatment that prevented the formation of large-domain aggregates and restrained the damages of strong acids to PET substrates.6 The optimized OSCs yielded the maximum PCE of 10.12% and an enhanced flexibility.6 However, because of the direct contact between the acids and PET, the acid soaking treatments inevitably destroyed the underlying plastic substrates. Moreover, the acid socking treatments were prone to induce rather weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions between the PEDOT:PSS electrodes and the underlying substrates,6,21,22,29 thus hampering the development of PEDOT:PSS into flexible OSCs. To solve the issue, Kim et al. reported a unique H2SO4 assisted transfer-printed technology that prevented direct contact between the strong acids and plastic substrates. It enabled a flexible PEDOT:PSS FTE with high FoM of 78.29 Despite the monumental research results, the precise adjustment of the vdW interactions at the interfaces and the usage of harsh H2SO4 treatments would cause a lack of reproducibility of FTE productions and safety issues. Moreover, the reported PCE (∼7.7%) of the flexible devices was on par with the flexible OSCs with ITO29 and ZnO/metal/ZnO,30 but did not outperform the Ag NW-based flexible OSCs with 8.75% efficiency31 (Table S1, ESI†). Whether the flexible OSCs afford the harsh mechanical insults (e.g., full folding) still remains unknown.
A gentle acid and D-sorbitol assisted transfer-printing technology opens up an avenue in realizing the high-performance PEDOT:PSS electrodes that can show high FoM, low roughness, strong adhesion with underlying substrates, and high flexibility. The high FoM (∼83) of the plastic electrode reported here rivals the best performing PEDOT:PSS films with strong acid treatments.21,29 Moreover, a key design is proposed to plasticize PEDOT:PSS and boost the adhesion between PEDOT:PSS and PET. The soft material (SM) of D-sorbitol, inserted between PEDOT:PSS and PET substrates, can relax the PEDOT:PSS nanofibrils (or aggregates) and avoid some abrasion on the PEDOT:PSS films under stress loading. Thanks to the SM, the interface force (Ni) between PEDOT:PSS and PET is excepted to be enhanced notably. Thus, continuous conducting pathways are retained in the PEDOT:PSS/SM/PET samples, where PEDOT:PSS and PET bonded well even with a harsh flexing deformation.
Here, we demonstrate the highly efficient and mechanically robust OSC devices fabricated on the PEDOT:PSS/SM/PET substrates. A thin layer of D-sorbitol is employed to increase largely the interface bonding between the PEDOT:PSS and PET substrates. Owing to the highest FoM of 83, outstanding mechanical flexibility, and long-term air stability of the PEDOT:PSS electrodes, the flexible OSC devices yield an average PCE of 9.94% with the maximum value up to 10.19% and hold most of the initial efficiency in the bending and full folding tests. Notably, the value of 9.94% is higher than 8.60% for ITO electrodes, 9.25% for Ag NW electrodes, and 9.57% for ZnO/Ag/ZnO electrodes. Furthermore, the hybrid FTEs composed of PEDOT:PSS are also fabricated, enabling the flexible OSCs to exhibit the record efficiency up to 10.55%.
2. Results and discussion
Optical and electrical characteristics of PEDOT:PSS
We first selected four kinds of strong acids to immerse the as-cast PEDOT:PSS films and were devoted to the improvement of the film conductivity via precise adjustment of the curing temperatures of acid processing. The four kinds of acids include 98 wt% sulfuric acid (H2SO4), 68 wt% nitric acid (HNO3), 99 wt% methanesulfonic acid (CH4SO3), and 98 wt% formic acid (CH2O2). Notably, the acid methods comprising the CH4SO3 treatments have been widely reported for PEDOT:PSS modification,6,21–23,29 but most of the PEDOT:PSS electrodes were evaluated only using the square resistance (Rsq) or electrical conductivity rather than FoM. Indeed, the optical transparency of the PEDOT:PSS electrodes is critical to the OSC device performance. In addition, the acid soaking methods also deserve to be investigated further for making the best performing PEDOT:PSS electrodes with the highest FoM.
The FoM of transparent electrodes is defined as the ratio of direct current conductivity (σdc) to optical conductivity (σop):28  where T(λ) is the transmittance at λ = 550 nm. A FoM value over 35 indicates the commercial viability of the transparent electrodes. Here, it was found that the FoM and Rsq are sensitive to the curing temperatures of acid processing. We first plotted the Rsq of the acid-treated PEDOT:PSS films (Fig. 1A). Obviously, the lowest value (∼42 Ω sq−1) is achieved for the films with low-temperature H2SO4 treatments at 20 °C. Notably, the data for the films with HNO3 treatments at ≥60 °C could not be provided because of the formation of broken films in harsh HNO3 processing. Moreover, the optical transparency (T) spectra of PEDOT:PSS are shown in Fig. S1, ESI.† It illustrates that the PEDOT:PSS films with CH4SO3 and CH2O2 treatments outperform the ones with H2SO4 and HNO3 treatments, and the CH4SO3-treated films (∼100 °C) exhibited a broad plateau above 90.0% in the visible and near-infrared regions. It is mainly attributed to the removal of the hydrophilic PSS chains from the PEDOT:PSS matrices and the formation of ordered PEDOT conformations induced by acid processing.21,22,29 On the basis of the results, FoM values of the PEDOT:PSS films are calculated as plotted in Fig. 1B. The highest FoM of the films is in excess of 35 and reaches 83 for CH4SO3 (∼40 °C), 79 for H2SO4 (∼20 °C), 77 for CH2O2 (∼20 °C), and 35 for HNO3 (∼20 °C). The value of 83 surpasses the previous record values (72,21 78,29 and 756) of the PEDOT:PSS films with H2SO4 and CH4SO3 treatments, and that (4715) of the PEDOT:PSS films with chloroplatinic acid treatments. Next, the best performing PEDOT:PSS electrodes with the highest FoM were transfer-printed from the glass donor substrates to the PET target substrates via interface bonding engineering that induces intimate contact between PEDOT:PSS and PET.

Morphology and component analysis of PEDOT:PSS
When the as-cast PEDOT:PSS films were treated with highly concentrated acids, the H+ originated from the acids would combine with the insulating PSS− to form the neutral PSSH. The coulombic attraction disappeared when the PSS chains became PSSH chains by taking protons from the acids and other PSS chains. The PSSH chains segregated from the film matrix and were removed by washing, thus the phase separation occurred. Fig. 2A and B show the atomic force microscopic (AFM) images of the pristine films and the films with the optimal CH4SO3 treatments (40 °C). The as-cast films show a smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) of 1.61 nm, whereas the acid-treated PEDOT:PSS films exhibit a better phase separation with a low RMS of 2.03 nm. Linear/extended-coil PEDOT nanofibrils probably appeared, which allowed more interchain interactions between the PEDOT conducting polymers for charge hopping.23 It should be noted that the post treatments (i.e., acid treatments) differ from the pre-treatments of DMSO and IL doping reported before.25–28 The pre-treatments commonly induced the formation of large-domain aggregates18,34 of PEDOT:PSS that were difficult to filter in aqueous solutions. Indeed, the formation of large-domain aggregates will hamper the development of R2R printing and blading manufacturing of PEDOT:PSS, and make PEDOT:PSS unsuitable for fabricating high-efficiency flexible OSC devices.

Fig. 2C and D show the S 2p X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) of the as-cast film and the films with the optimal acid treatments. Notably, S 2p XPS signals of 166–172 eV are mostly originated from sulfonate moieties (–SO3H) of PSS; whereas S 2p XPS signals of 162–166 eV are originated from the thiophene rings (–S–) of PEDOT.29,32 The curve-fitting results demonstrate that the ratio of S in –S– of PEDOT to total S atoms is increased from ∼31 to ∼55 atom% upon the CH4SO3 treatments, suggesting a large removal (∼63.2%) of insulating the PSS from the PEDOT:PSS matrices that contributes to the improvement in FoM. The result is consistent with the findings of HNO3 treated PEDOT:PSS.35 Over 60% PSS components were removed from the PEDOT:PSS matrix, resulting in the structural rearrangements of PEDOT with an enhanced crystallinity.35
Adhesion of PEDOT:PSS films
For making high-quality PEDOT:PSS electrodes, the CH4SO3 and SM (i.e., D-sorbitol) assisted transfer-printing technology is developed here to control the interface bonding among the glass donor substrates, PEDOT:PSS, and PET target substrates. Here, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps were used as media in the transfer-printing processing. The transfer-printing procedure is illustrated clearly in Fig. S2, ESI.† The as-cast PEDOT:PSS film was first spin-coated on the glass substrates. The –SO3H groups of PSS interact with the hydroxyl groups (–OH) on the glass substrates. When the acid treatment was carried out, the H+ ionized from the acids would combine with the insulating PSS− chains to form the neutral PSSH chains and simultaneously induce the formation of ordered crystalline PEDOT conformation.21,24,29,35 It alters the adhesion properties of the PEDOT:PSS films due to a large removal of PSS− from the PEDOT:PSS matrices, thereby resulting in a rather weak vdW interaction (1.5 ± 0.5 N m−1) at the interface of the PEDOT:PSS/glass. Note that the vdW force was measured by perpendicularly peeling off the PDMS stamps that were linked by a dynamometer. The adhesion force (1.5 ± 0.5 N m−1) at the interface of the PEDOT:PSS/glass is much lower than that (∼5.3 N m−1) of the H2SO4-treated PEDOT:PSS/glass in literature,29 and it is thus favored to the transferring of PEDOT:PSS to the PDMS stamps. Then, the PDMS stamps were attached on the target substrates of the PET substrates that were earlier coated with the SM thin layer (<10 nm). With thermal annealing at 80 °C, the PEDOT:PSS films are ready for printing on the PET substrates, mostly owing to the strong adhesion provided by the SM materials with rich –OH groups (Fig. 3A).
 Fig. 3  (A) Schematic diagram of morphology and bonding of the as-cast PEDOT:PSS and acid-treated PEDOT:PSS films on the SM surfaces. The mechanism of transfer-printing is based on the controlled adhesion of PEDOT:PSS to the underlying substrates using CH4SO3 and SM. (B) Adhesion at three interfaces measured in the 90° peeling tests. The adhesion of PEDOT:PSS is estimated using the peeling force per unit width. 
To investigate the interface bonding between PEDOT:PSS and PDMS, and between PEDOT:PSS and the PET substrates, 90° peeling tests were conducted as well. The PEDOT:PSS/PDMS was placed on the SM-coated PET substrates (namely SM/PET) followed by a vertical peeling using the dynamometer (as shown in Fig. S3, ESI†). Next, the PEDOT:PSS films were printed on the SM/PET surfaces while the dynamometer detected a force of 4.0 ± 0.6 N m−1 that was the adhesion force between PEDOT:PSS and PDMS, whereas, for measuring the adhesion forces between the printed films and the SM/PET substrates, the printed PEDOT:PSS film was attached with an adhesive tape that was linked to the dynamometer. Through 90° peeling off the PDMS stamps, PEDOT:PSS was transferred from SM/PET to the tape. As a result, the adhesion forces between the printed film and the SM/PET substrates were measured to be 12 ± 2 N m−1. All the interface interactions are illustrated in Fig. 3B. The large gaps of the adhesion forces (i.e., 1.5 ± 0.5 and 12 ± 2 N m−1) contribute to the feasible printing process.
Film flexibility and air stability
A flexible FTE should retain most of its initial conductivity while undergoing bending deformations. Because strong acid treatments induce a rather weak bonding at the interfaces between PEDOT:PSS and its underlying substrates,23,26,29,32,33 harsh bending deformations probably cause the acid-treated PEDOT:PSS films to peel off from the underlying substrates, and the mechanical insults would cause the crack propagation and defects under applied strains, thus leading to physical discontinuities of the PEDOT:PSS films with a sharp increase in Rsq. This issue can be avoided by using the soft materials to plasticize PEDOT:PSS and to enhance the interface bonding between PEDOT:PSS and PET. Fig. 4A shows the Rsq values of the transfer-printed PEDOT:PSS/SM/PET and the CH4SO3-treated PEDOT:PSS/PET (control samples) as a function of the number of bending cycles at r of ∼3.0 mm and ∼0.8 mm, respectively. Note that the control samples (i.e., PEDOT:PSS/PET) were obtained by the CH4SO3 soaking at 40 °C, and the usage of SM did not downgrade the electrical performance of the PEDOT:PSS films. The result demonstrates that when subjected to 1000 cycle bending (r: 3.0 mm) followed by relaxing, both the samples still maintain a low Rsq, which is increased by 9% and 14%, respectively, as compared to the initial value (∼52 Ω sq−1). For extremely small bending radii of ∼0.8 mm, we observe that the samples show an increase of 38% and 86% in the Rsq, respectively. This implies that the inserts of SM did indeed play a critical role not only for making an intimate physical contact between the PEDOT:PSS electrodes and the PET substrates but also for inducing a continuous conducting pathway on the PET surface. Owing to the record FoM, smoothness, uniformity, and robust flexibility of PEDOT:PSS/SM/PET, we envision that it is highly suitable for the integration of mechanically robust flexible solar cells with high efficiency.

Additionally, PEDOT:PSS absorbs water from the surrounding environments owing to its hygroscopic property, thus rendering the conducting polymers vulnerable in humid conditions. In addition, the oxidation/reduction of PEDOT:PSS occurred in the humid and thermal conditions of air atmosphere that would affect the charge hopping of the PEDOT:PSS films. Here, we further investigated the air stability of the PEDOT:PSS/SM/PET samples exposed to ambient air (temperature: 15–20 °C; humidity: 55–70%). Fig. 4B shows the variation of Rsq/Rsq(o) of the PEDOT:PSS/SM/PET samples in the period of 90 days. An increase of 11–19% in Rsq was observed for the transfer-printed PEDOT:PSS films with acid treatments at 40–100 °C. The limited increase in the square resistance indicates good air stability of the fabricated PEDOT:PSS/SM/PET samples.
Device performance
On the basis of the PEDOT:PSS/SM/PET samples, we further fabricated the fully solution-processed flexible OSC devices with the structure of PET/PEDOT:PSS FTE/PEDOT:PSS(4083)/poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (namely PBDB-T):(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-1-methyl-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (namely IT-M)/perylene diimide amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Al. The molecular structures of PBDB-T and IT-M are illustrated in Fig. S4, ESI.†

Fig. 5A shows the current-density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the flexible devices fabricated on PEDOT:PSS/SM/PET, PEDOT:PSS/PET, and commercial ITO (180 nm)/PET substrates. Here, the PEDOT:PSS/PET electrodes were prepared by spin-coating PEDOT:PSS (1000) on the PET substrates followed by the optimized CH4SO3 processing. The device fabrication is much simpler than that reported in the literature,6 which used complex designs of double-layer PEDOT:PSS electrodes along with double buffer layers of PEDOT:PSS (4083). The results demonstrate that the flexible devices with PEDOT:PSS/SM/PET yield an average efficiency of ∼9.94% with the maximum value up to ∼10.19% (Fig. S5, ESI†), which is higher than that (∼9.88%) of the devices using the PEDOT:PSS/PET substrates, indicating an efficient charge-carrier collection by the transfer-printed PEDOT:PSS electrodes with the acid modification. Note that the average value (∼9.94%) outperforms the ITO (180 nm)/PET (∼8.60% reported here) and the current best-known reported PEDOT:PSS electrodes (Table S1, ESI†). Table 1 summarizes the photovoltaic performance data of all the flexible OSC devices.

To compare the bending flexibility of these flexible devices without encapsulation, a bending test was conducted in nitrogen-filled glove-boxes. Three kinds of flexible OSCs were deformed at a bending radius of ∼3.0 mm (as shown in Fig. S6, ESI†). Fig. 5B shows the profiles of the normalized PCE values versus bending cycles for the flexible devices. The results show that the flexible devices fabricated on PEDOT:PSS/SM/PET maintain a high efficiency without obvious drops in flexing up to 250 cycles, and the devices retain ∼92.6% of the original PCE in the 1000 cycles of the flexing tests. However, the PCE of the flexible devices with PEDOT:PSS/PET retain ∼80.6% of the initial values. In contrast, ITO-based flexible devices have a sharp drop in PCE to ∼55.0%; this was mainly due to the mechanical strength and rigid nature of ITO. These trends of PCE in the flexing tests indicate that the usage of SM improves the mechanical flexibility of the flexible ITO-free OSC devices. The evolved flexibility is mainly attributed to the usage of SM that enables a continuous conducting pathway of PEDOT:PSS and induces a high adhesion of 12 ± 2 N cm−1 for strong bonding between PEDOT:PSS and its underlying plastic substrates. Additionally, the implementation of the unique transfer-printing strategies prevents the direct contact of strong acids and PET substrates, thus protecting the PET substrates. As a result, the solar cells survived the harsh bending deformations. Our results demonstrate that the usage of SM is critical to the high-performance flexible organic solar cells.
Furthermore, the flexible devices with PEDOT:PSS/SM/PET were subject to full folding (loading time: >60 s) that caused a vertically warping. Notably, the flexible devices tolerated two configurations of full folding, e.g., folding the middle regions of the devices and directly folding the top electrodes of the Al metals. Fig. 5C and D show the J–V curves of the flexible devices with PEDOT:PSS/SM/PET along with the device photographs. While affording the harsh folding deformations, the flexible devices still held the high PCE of ∼9.06% and ∼7.88%, receptively. We believe that other types of flexible and folding photovoltaics with high efficiency will be realized in the future by using the interface bond engineering.
Other types of flexible OSCs
One of the important advantages of the transfer-printing method is to enable the new constructions of transparent electrodes such as the hybrid electrodes of PEDOT:PSS/SM/ZnO (25 nm)/Ag (9 nm)/ZnO (25 nm) and PEDOT:PSS/SM/Ag NW. Both the hybrid electrodes were prepared by printing PEDOT:PSS on the plastic substrates of PET coated with ZnO/Ag/ZnO and Ag NWs, respectively. The printed PEDOT:PSS films have an intimate interface contact with their underlying layers and endow the hybrid FTE films with a low square resistance for effective charge-carrier collections, thus enabling the high-efficiency flexible OSCs. On the basis of the printed PEDOT:PSS/Ag NW/PET substrates and the printed PEDOT:PSS/ZnO/Ag/ZnO/PET substrates, new types of flexible OSC devices were fabricated as well. Both the flexible devices exhibited an average PCE of ∼10.21% and ∼10.55% (Fig. 5E and F), which is in stark contrast to that (∼9.57% and ∼9.78%) of the control solar cells based on Ag NW and ZnO/Ag/ZnO electrodes,. The results demonstrate the universality and advantages of the printed PEDOT:PSS electrodes for making high-efficiency flexible photovoltaic devices. Considering the advantages of the organic photovoltaics such as cost-effective printability, the average PCEs over 10% represent an acceptable efficiency level for the commercial flexible productions.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate a type of highly efficiency and mechanically flexible OSC fabricated on the transfer-printed PEDOT:PSS/SM/PET substrates. The optimal PEDOT:PSS electrodes, which are insensitive to harsh mechanical deformations, exhibit a high FoM of 83, a strong adhesion with the underlying plastic substrates (Ni = 12 ± 2 N m−1), an outstanding mechanical flexibility, and long-term air stability. The fully solution-prepared flexible OSCs showed the highest PCE of 10.19% and the devices retain most of the initial efficiency in harsh flexing and full folding tests. Furthermore, the gentle acid and SM assisted transfer-printing strategy facilitates versatile integration with other kinds of classic ITO alternatives including Ag NW and ZnO/Ag/ZnO. On the basis of the new hybrid electrodes of printed PEDOT:PSS/Ag NW and printed PEDOT:PSS/ZnO/Ag/ZnO, the champion of the flexible OSCs exhibit a record PCE up to 10.21% and 10.55%, respectively. We envision that the unique transfer-printing strategy allows the integration and implementation of highly efficient, ultra-flexible, and cost-effective OSC productions into the rigid silicon-dominated market.
4. Experimental
Materials
PBDB-T and IT-M were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc, Beijing. PEDOT:PSS aqueous solutions (i.e., Clevios PH1000 and Clevios P VP 4083) were purchased from Heraeus, Germany.
Preparation of PEDOT:PSS FTEs
PET (∼140 μm) and glass substrates with an area of 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in deionized (DI) water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA). The glass stamps were treated in a UV–ozone chamber for 10 min prior to the coating of PEDOT:PSS. A PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (1000) doped with 0.5 vol% Zonyl FS300 was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter followed by spin-coating on PET substrates at 2000 rpm to form a pristine PEDOT:PSS film. Then, the pristine film was dried at 100 °C for 10 min. Next, the acid treatments were carried out on the glass substrates coated with PEDOT:PSS by dipping them in the highly concentrated acid solutions. After the acid treatments, the films were washed by DI water and IPA, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min for making highly conductive PEDOT:PSS electrodes.
Preparation of PEDOT:PSS/SM/PET
PDMS and hardener (Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer, Dow Corning, USA) with 10:1 weight ratio were mixed and dipped on Si plates. Subsequently, the PDMS was annealed at 80 °C for 120 min to form a 1–2 mm thick PDMS stamp. The stamp was then linked with the acid-treated PEDOT:PSS films. By peeling off the PDMS stamps (peeling rate: 2.0 ± 0.5 cm s−1), the PEDOT:PSS films were transferred from the glass donor substrates to the medium of the PDMS stamps. Then, the PDMS stamps linked with the PEDOT:PSS films were placed on the target substrates of PET that were spin-coated with a D-sorbitol layer (thickness <10 nm) using the PEDOT:PSS (4083) aqueous solutions doped with 10.7 wt% D-sorbitol. Finally, the acid-treated PEDOT:PSS films were ready for printing onto the target substrates of SM/PET by peeling off the PDMS stamps. Notably, before peeling off the PDMS, the samples were thermally annealed at 80 °C for 2 min, followed by fast cooling in air.
For making PEDOT:PSS/Ag NW/PET, two layers of the PEDOT:PSS (1000) doped with 6 vol% DMSO and the PEDOT:PSS (4083) doped with 10.7 wt% D-sorbitol were subsequently spin-coated on the Ag NW/PET substrates, followed by the printing of acid-treated PEDOT:PSS films, whereas, for making PEDOT:PSS/ZnO/Ag (9 nm)/ZnO/PET, one layer of PEDOT:PSS (4083) doped with 10.7 wt% D-sorbitol was directly spin-coated on ZnO/Ag/ZnO/PET surfaces for laminating the acid-treated PEDOT:PSS films.
Flexible OSC fabrication
A PEDOT:PSS buffer layer (4083) was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS FTE/PET substrates at 3000 rpm, which were then dried at 100 °C for 10 min to form the anode buffer layers. Then, the solution of PBDB-T:IT-M (1:1 w/w, 10 mg mL−1 for PBDB-T) in chlorobenzene doped with 0.5 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane was spin-coated on the surfaces of the buffer layers at 1800 rpm for 60 s and then thermally annealed at 130 °C for 10 min in glove boxes filled with nitrogen. Then, PDINO in methanol (1.5 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the surfaces of active layers at 2000 rpm to obtain the cathode buffer layer (thickness: ∼10 nm). Finally, the cathodes of Al (thickness: ∼100 nm) were thermally evaporated under a shadow mask at 10−4 Pa. The shadow mask has eight square holes with precise areas of 2.0 mm × 2.0 mm, ensuring the corresponding active area (4.0 mm2) of the Al cathodes. For J–V characteristics, two metal probes were contacted with each Al cathode and the anodes (i.e., PEDOT:PSS, Ag NW, and ZnO/Ag/ZnO).
Characterizations
Film thickness was measured by a surface profile-meter (Talysurf Series II). Electrical contacts were made by two lines of Ag pastes on a square (as shown in Fig. S7, ESI†). The square resistance was obtained using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system. The transparency spectra were taken on a Hitachi U-3010 UV-Visible spectrophotometer. The film morphology was investigated by atomic force microscopy (VEECO Dimension 3100V). The compositions of the PEDOT:PSS films were studied by XPS (XSAM800). The 90° peeling tests were performed using a smart dynamometer operated at a peeling rate of ∼1.5 mm s−1 with a transparent and adhesive tape (Jinghua tape, China) of 11 mm width. Using a Keithley 2440 source-measure unit integrated with AM 1.5 G solar simulator (Newport-Oriel® Sol3A 450W), the J–V characteristics of the solar cells were obtained in N2-filled glove boxes. The light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon detector. To evaluate the device flexibility, the solar cells were bent with a radius of ∼3.0 mm and underwent 1000 cycles of bending, followed by the J–V characteristics.
