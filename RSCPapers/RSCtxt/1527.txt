    , Accepted 12th June 2017First published on 12th June 2017AbstractSputter-deposited TiO2 films with high visible-light photocatalytic activity were successfully realized by a hybrid TiO2/Pt/WO3 film structure with Pt nanoparticles uniformly distributed at the interface of the TiO2 and WO3 films. The TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid films enable the complete decomposition of CH3CHO under visible-light irradiation. The water contact angle of the TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid films reaches below 5° under visible-light irradiation. Pt nanoparticles are considered to act as a cocatalyst to improve the electron–hole separation efficiency. We demonstrate that the photogenerated holes in WO3 are transferred to the surface of the TiO2 film with less hole-trapping and induce high visible-light photocatalytic activity and hydrophilic behavior, and the photogenerated electrons are accumulated in the Pt nanoparticles. The highly hydrophilic thin films with high visible-light photocatalytic activity can be applied to various indoor products possessing self-cleaning and antifogging properties.
1 Introduction
TiO2 photocatalysts have been widely used in various applications, such as self-cleaning and antifogging surfaces, because of their high chemical stability and exceptionally efficient photoactivity as well as the long lifetime of photogenerated carriers.1,2 TiO2 is a wide bandgap oxide (3.0 eV for rutile TiO2 and 3.2 eV for anatase TiO2), and absorbs only a small portion of the solar spectrum in the ultraviolet (UV) region. Therefore, the TiO2 photoactivity is low in the visible region, and improving the photocatalytic ability of TiO2 in the visible region is important for practical applications.
Most research efforts have been devoted to improving the photocatalytic activity in the visible region.1,3–5 A well-known approach is the modification of the band structure of TiO2 to shift its absorption edge towards the visible-light region, thus improving its photocatalytic activity. This can be implemented by doping TiO2 with either anions or cations.1,3–5 Nitrogen doping can lead to an acceptor level above the valence band minimum of TiO2 that narrows the bandgap and enhances the visible-light active photocatalysis.3,4 Transitional metal ions, such as V and Nb, are often used as the cation dopants in TiO2.5 Although the anion or cation dopants can reduce the bandgap of TiO2, experimental studies suggest that impurity atoms also form carrier recombination centres and strongly localized states within the bandgap, both of which significantly reduce the lifetime of the electron–hole pairs.
An alternative approach to suppress the recombination of photogenerated charges owing to impurity doping is to build TiO2/semiconductor hybrid structures with well-matched energy band alignments between TiO2 and the semiconductor layers.6 Crystalline WO3 has a suitable conduction band (CB) energy for alignment with TiO2. In TiO2/WO3 hybrid structures, the photogenerated electrons are transferred from the CB of TiO2 to the CB of WO3. Tatsuma et al. first reported a TiO2/WO3 composite as an energy storage photocatalyst that can be used in the dark. The reductive energy or electrons in WO3 were stored under UV irradiation.7–9 On the other hand, WO3 has a lower bandgap than TiO2, and the visible-light-generated holes in the valence band (VB) of WO3 are expected to move to the VB of TiO2 according to the concept of band alignment. Several studies have reported enhanced photocatalytic activity in TiO2 by coupling with WO3 in the visible-light region owing to the hole transfer from the VB of WO3 to the VB of TiO2.10–13 Miyauchi et al. reported that the oxidation reaction was enhanced because of the presence of the WO3 layer, and the reduction reaction was not enhanced in the TiO2/WO3 system under UV irradiation.14 However, in these studies, the WO3 and TiO2 particles were directly coupled to form a film, thus hindering the understanding of the hole transfer behavior from the VB of WO3 to the VB of TiO2 because of the photocatalytic activity of WO3. Moreover, Pt-loaded WO3 was reported to exhibit high efficiency for the decomposition of organic compounds under visible light irradiation due to the multi-electron O2 reduction reaction,15 and Srinivasan and Miyauchi fabricated a TiO2/WO3 hybrid film on a layer of Pt nanoparticles to observe the hole and electron transfer behavior under visible light, where the Pt nanoparticles are considered as the electron pool to accumulate the photogenerated electron from WO3 and produce hydrogen peroxide by the multielectron reduction of oxygen molecules.16 For the TiO2/WO3/Pt hybrid films, because of the porous structures of the TiO2 and WO3 layers, the functionality of Pt nanoparticles as the electron pool cannot be directly demonstrated. Therefore, the following issues need to be clarified: (1) the charge-separation efficiency in the TiO2/WO3 hybrid structures under visible-light irradiation, (2) the photogenerated hole/electron transfer behavior between the WO3 and TiO2 layers, and (3) the photogenerated electron transfer from the WO3 layers to Pt nanoparticles. To solve these problems, it is helpful to explore the application of TiO2/WO3 photocatalysts in the visible region under some extreme conditions because WO3 is soluble under alkaline conditions and has poor corrosion resistance.17
In this study, we investigate the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2/WO3 hybrid films under visible-light irradiation, and the mechanism of charge separation in such hybrid structures was given. The WO3 film was firstly deposited on a quartz substrate, and the dense TiO2 film was subsequently deposited on the surface of the WO3 film by magnetron sputtering. Pt nanoparticles were inserted between the TiO2 and WO3 layers to improve the photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation, and the functionality of the Pt nanoparticles as the electron pool was demonstrated on the basis of the physics of polaron absorption. The TiO2/Pt/WO3 structure is expected to find use in extreme environments, such as alkaline and corrosive environments.
2 Methods
2.1 Film preparation
WO3 films were coated on the unheated quartz substrates by DC magnetron sputtering using a 3 inch diameter W metal target at room temperature. The base pressure of the deposition chamber was less than 8.0 × 10−4 Pa. Pure oxygen gas (99.99%) was used as the sputtering and reactive gas. The DC sputtering power was 100 W, and the working pressure was 3.0 Pa. The distance between the target and the substrate was 45 mm, and the maximum vertical magnetic field strength at the magnetron target surface was 1000 G. Then, the WO3 film was post-annealed at 400 °C in air. Post-annealing at this temperature improved the photoinduced superhydrophilicity and oxidative decomposition of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) under visible-light irradiation, compared with those deposited on the substrate heated at 800 °C.6 The thickness of the WO3 films was set to 700 nm, which was optimized to produce the maximum photocatalytic activity for CH3CHO decomposition under visible light irradiation. TiO2 films (30 or 100 nm in thickness) were deposited on the WO3 film by DC magnetron sputtering using a 3 inch diameter Ti metal target. The total gas pressure and sputtering power were the same as in the case of WO3. The substrate temperature was kept at 200 °C. Pt nanoparticles were deposited between the TiO2 film and WO3 film by using the sputtering process (AUTO Sputter Coater, JEOL, JFC-1300). Pt deposition was done in air with a total pressure of 8.0 Pa, and the distance between the Pt target and the substrate was 45 cm. The Pt deposition rate was approximately 0.3 nm s−1. The deposition time was set to 7 and 10 s to optimize the photocatalytic activity for CH3CHO decomposition, where our previous studies suggested that the surface coverage of the Pt nanoparticles on the WO3 film was about 60% based on the analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as described elsewhere.18
2.2 Characterization
The film thickness was measured using a surface profiler (Dektak). The transmittance (T) and reflectance (R) of the films were measured using an optical spectrophotometer (UV-3150, Shimadzu) in the spectral range of 200–2500 nm. The structural properties were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements in both θ–2θ and 2θ scan modes using Cu Kα1 radiation at 40 kV and 20 mA (Shimadzu XRD-6000). More precise structural analyses were conducted using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL JEM-4010, 400 kV). Planar and cross-sectional TEM specimens were prepared by mechanical thinning, followed by argon ion milling with precisely controlled incident angle and energy, which were optimized to prevent damaging the thin specimens.
The photocatalytic activity was evaluated on the basis of the extent of decomposition of CH3CHO under visible-light irradiation (a Xe lamp with a 410–500 nm band pass filter, and an intensity of 1.0 mW cm−2 at the film surface). The decomposition of CH3CHO and the generation of CO2 on the WO3 films were evaluated by respectively examining the decrease and increase of their concentrations in a quartz cell that contained a 50 mm × 50 mm specimen. The CH3CHO and CO2 concentrations were measured by gas chromatography (GC-14B, Shimadzu) before and after visible light irradiation. The photoinduced hydrophilicity was also evaluated by contact angle measurements for pure water, which were carried out at room temperature in an ambient atmosphere using a contact angle meter (CA-X, Kyowa Kaimen Kagaku) with an experimental error of less than 1°. A black light lamp with a wavelength centered at 352 nm and an intensity of 0.4 mW cm−2 at the film surface was used for UV irradiation.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structural and optical properties

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the WO3, Pt/WO3, TiO2/WO3 and TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid films on the quartz glass substrate. Sharp diffraction peaks are observed at 2θ = 23.2° and 24.4°, which are in agreement with the diffraction peaks from the (002) and (200) planes of triclinic WO3, respectively. The WO3 films prepared by sputtering and thermal oxidation (post-annealed) often have a triclinic structure, and the electrodeposition method produces WO3 films with hexagonal structures.19 The diffraction peaks from the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 are observed in the hybrid films when the thickness of TiO2 is 100 nm. Diffraction peaks from the Pt nanoparticles are not observed.

Fig. 2 shows the TEM images of the TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid film. The cross-sectional images of the WO3 films show an equiaxial structure with voids, whereas those of the TiO2 films show lateral grain sizes of 20–40 nm. The TEM image of the TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid film also revealed that the Pt layer resembled an island–sea structure along the interface of the TiO2 and WO3 layers. The Pt nanoparticles are approximately 3 nm in diameter, as shown in Fig. 2E. The polycrystalline nature of TiO2 and WO3 was also confirmed by the SAED measurements, as shown in Fig. 2C, and the preferred crystallographic orientation along the TiO2 film surface cannot be identified because of the random orientation.

Fig. 3a shows the absorption spectra of the triclinic WO3 and anatase TiO2 films on the quartz substrate. The optical bandgap is obtained from the plots of (αhν)1/2versus hν because the electronic structures of WO3 and anatase TiO2 have an indirect transition,20,21 where α and E are the absorption coefficient and the photon energy, respectively. Each plot is linear, and the intercept of absorption provides indirect bandgap values of 2.65 and 3.44 eV independent of the film thickness. Literature values range from 2.6 to 2.8 eV for WO3,20 and 3.3 to 3.5 eV for TiO2.21,22 These values suggest that after post-annealing, the sputter-deposited WO3 film is a visible-light-activated photocatalyst, and the sputter-deposited TiO2 is a UV photocatalyst.

(a) Absorption spectra of the WO3 and TiO2 films deposited on the quartz glass substrate, and the optical bandgap is determined by the Tauc plot. The insets in (a) show the T and R spectra of the WO3 and TiO2 films, respectively. (b) T and R spectra of WO3, Pt/WO3, WO3/TiO2, and WO3/Pt/TiO2 hybrid films, respectively. 

Fig. 3b shows the T and R spectra for WO3, Pt/WO3, WO3/TiO2, and WO3/Pt/TiO2 hybrid films, respectively, where the thickness of the TiO2 film is 30 or 100 nm for the hybrid films. WO3 mainly absorbs visible light to generate electron–hole pairs in a wavelength range of 380–480 nm, and a slight decrease in transmittance for the TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid films is observed by comparing them with the WO3/TiO2 films in this wavelength range. It is attributed to an increase in reflectance due to the high reflectivity of Pt nanoparticles. Because there is no obvious change in T and R for the hybrid films with/without Pt nanoparticles, the shadowing effect from Pt nanoparticles could be neglected. Our previous studies suggested that the WO3 films with a thickness larger than 500 nm enhanced the visible absorption (380–480 nm) (not published), where the maximum decomposition ability of CH3CHO under visible-light irradiation for WO3 was reached when the thickness of the single WO3 layer was approximately 600–700 nm, and a further increase in thickness did not improve the decomposition ability due to the recombination of electron–hole pairs.
3.2 Visible-light-induced photocatalytic activity for the hybrid films
The decomposition of CH3CHO (at an initial concentration of 60 ppm) and the generation of CO2 on the WO3 films under visible-light irradiation after being held in the dark for 60 min was used to estimate the sample adsorption, as shown in Fig. 4a. Compared with the single WO3 film and TiO2/WO3 hybrid film, the loading of the Pt nanoparticles obviously improved the decomposition rate of CH3CHO. The low photocatalytic activity for the single WO3 film was attributed to the limited oxidative decomposition ability because the low reduction potential of the electron in WO3 and Pt loading can trap photogenerated electrons from WO3 to reduce O2 to H2O2.15,23 The Pt/WO3 film has the highest decomposition rate, whereas the TiO2 layer onto the Pt/WO3 film slightly decreases the decomposition rate. The TiO2 layer is expected to improve the chemical stability of WO3, particularly under alkaline conditions.

Fig. 4b shows the CH3CHO decomposition and CO2 emission as a function of the elapsed time for the Pt/WO3 and TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid films. Complete decomposition is achieved after 18 h for the Pt/WO3 hybrid film, and 24 h for the TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid film. Nevertheless, after complete CH3CHO decomposition, CO2 continued to be emitted, thus suggesting that intermediate byproducts were produced, such as CH3COOH,24,25 during the photo-induced oxidation reaction.
The relation between CH3CHO decomposition and CO2 production is observed in Table 1. The photoinduced complete decomposition of CH3CHO on the film surface is expressed by the following reaction:24 CH3CHO + 10h+ + 3H2O → 2CO2 + 10H+(1)where h+ is the photogenerated hole, and H2O is considered to be the surface-adsorbed water. The initial concentration of CH3CHO was 500 ppm, and the anticipated CO2 after the complete decomposition of CH3CHO is 1000 ppm; however, the concentration of CO2 does not reach twice the decomposition of CH3CHO for these films, thus suggesting the presence of intermediate byproducts.25 For a single WO3 layer or TiO2/WO3 without Pt nanoparticles, the ratio of CH3CHO to CO2 is 0.8, which implies that WO3 has a weak reduction ability. Compared with the single WO3 layer, the loading of Pt nanoparticles obviously improved the photocatalytic performance, as previously reported for the WO3 films fabricated using gas-flow sputtering.26 Interestingly, the TiO2 layer has no effect on the photocatalytic performance of the WO3 and Pt/WO3 films, thus suggesting that all photogenerated holes in WO3 are transferred to the surface of the TiO2 film with less hole trapping. Generally, oxide films deposited by conventional DC sputtering contain numerous structural defects generated by high-energy ion bombardment during deposition, such as O−-bombardment (with several hundreds of eV of energy), on the growing film surface. Hence, the TiO2 films are expected to have few structural defects that act as centres of electron–hole recombination.26,27

Fig. 5 shows the changes of CH3CHO and CO2 as a function of the elapsed time for the TiO2/WO3 and TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid films under UV irradiation. The ratio of CH3CHO to CO2 is 1:1.8 for the TiO2/WO3 hybrid film, and 1:1.9 for the TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid film. The elapsed time for the complete decomposition of CH3CHO is 240 min for the TiO2/WO3 hybrid film, and 180 min for the TiO2/Pt/WO3 film. The loading of Pt nanoparticles improves the decomposition rate.
 Fig. 5  Decomposition of CH3CHO by TiO2/WO3 and TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid films deposited on the quartz glass substrate under UV irradiation. The thickness of the TiO2 film is 100 nm. 
The experimental results suggest that the TiO2/WO3 hybrid film decomposes CH3CHO. The holes generated in the WO3 film under visible-light irradiation are transferred to the surface of the TiO2 film and participate in oxidative decomposition. This visible-light-induced photocatalytic activity of the TiO2/WO3 hybrid film is expressed by the following equations: (2)and e−(CB of WO3)⋯h+(VB of WO3) + TiO2 → e−(CB of WO3) + h+(VB of TiO2).(3) where e− is the photogenerated electrons in WO3, and the CB and VB are the conduction band and valence band, respectively. When the Pt nanoparticles are deposited at the interface of the TiO2 and WO3 films, the decomposition rate of CH3CHO becomes approximately two times faster than that for the TiO2/WO3 hybrid film. Given that the Pt nanoparticles have a large work function, the visible-light-induced electrons accumulated into WO3 are transferred to the CB of the Pt because of the band alignment: e−(CB of WO3) + Pt → e−(CB in Pt).(4)
Photocatalytic activity is often associated with the electron–hole production rate and electron–hole recombination rate. The electron storage in the Pt nanoparticles improves the electron consumption and leads to the formation of more electron–hole pairs. Although the decomposition rate in TiO2/Pt/WO3 is less than that in Pt/WO3, as shown in Fig. 4a, the TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid film enables complete decomposition due to the electron storage of the Pt nanoparticles for the long term. Moreover, the experimental results suggest that the photocatalytic performance of the TiO2/WO3 hybrid film approaches that of TiO2 under UV irradiation. Therefore, potential environmental applications of the TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid films are considered because of their excellent ability in terms of corrosion resistance and photocatalytic activity.
3.3 Visible-light-induced hydrophilicity for the hybrid films
The self-cleaning properties of the hybrid films are shown in Fig. 6. We monitored the changes in water contact angle under visible-light irradiation for clean surfaces. Fig. 6 shows the changes in the water contact angles of the thin films (WO3, TiO2/WO3, and TiO2/Pt/WO3) with clean surfaces as a function of the visible-light irradiation time. The water contact angle of the WO3 film is less than 5° after visible-light irradiation for 60 min, and the film becomes hydrophilic. The loading of the Pt nanoparticles onto the bare WO3 film obviously deteriorated the hydrophilic conversions of WO3, and made the contact angle of the film increase to above 25° even after long irradiation times. This is because the Pt nanoparticle surface was hydrophobic.20 By contrast, the coating of the TiO2 film onto the Pt/WO3 film decreased the contact angle to less than 5° after irradiation for 30 min, and is highly hydrophilic similar to that of the single WO3 film. The water contact angle of TiO2 under visible-light irradiation is reported to be approximately 20°–30° and decreases to <5° under UV irradiation. The UV induced hydrophilicity of TiO2 is often attributed to structural changes in the TiO2 surface,14,28 where photogenerated electron–hole pairs can lead to the reduction and oxidation of the TiO2 surface itself, resulting in the creation of oxygen vacancies at the surface which are presumably favorable for water adsorption.28 In the present study, the hydrophilicity of TiO2 as shown in Fig. 6 is induced by visible light irradiation. Given that TiO2 cannot generate electron–hole pairs under visible light, the photogenerated holes in the WO3 layer are transferred to the TiO2 layer, thus reacting with the surface lattice oxygen atoms, followed by the dissociation and adsorption of water molecules at the defect sites.14 Highly hydrophilic thin films with visible-light activity can be applied to various indoor products possessing self-cleaning and anti-fogging properties.

3.4 Electron accumulation in Pt nanoparticles
The valence band potential of WO3 is more positive than that of TiO2, and hence, the photogenerated holes in WO3 are expected to transfer to TiO2 under visible-light irradiation. This process helps the hydrophilicity of TiO2. In such a case, where is the photogenerated electron? In mixed TiO2 and WO3 nanoparticles,10 the photogenerated electrons react with the adsorbed oxygen to maintain the charge balance at the nanoparticle surface according to the following two- or multiple-electron reduction reaction: O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → H2O2,(5) O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O.(6)However, these reduction reactions are not expected to occur because the photogenerated electrons cannot be transferred to the surface of the TiO2 film in the TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid film from the aspect of the band alignment. Another possible route for the reduction reaction is that of oxygen molecule diffusion into the WO3 layer. As shown in Fig. 4a, the decomposition rate on 100 nm-thick TiO2 is much higher than that on 30 nm-thick TiO2, suggesting that oxygen molecules do not easily diffuse into the WO3 layers, which are expected to consume the electrons. Therefore, under visible-light irradiation, either the reductive energy or electrons are considered to be stored in the WO3 film or Pt nanoparticles.
To demonstrate the above, we compare the visible-light-induced electron/hole transfer behavior in TiO2/WO3 and TiO2/Pt/WO3 before and after UV irradiation treatment. Fig. 7 shows that the visible-light-induced decomposition of CH3CHO for the TiO2/WO3 and TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid films deposited on the quartz glass substrate before and after UV irradiation treatment. As shown in the insets of Fig. 7, TiO2/WO3 turns blue after UV irradiation treatment, whereas TiO2/Pt/WO3 does not change colour. The mechanism for the blue coloration of the TiO2/WO3 film is associated with polaron absorption in WO3.29 Small polarons are formed when excess electrons polarize their surrounding lattice so that localization of the wave function takes place essentially to one lattice site.29 This absorption is connected with polaron transfer by hopping between the W sites, which is denoted by A and B, according to (7)When the coloured samples are placed under visible light, no photocatalytic activity is observed because the accumulated electrons transferred from TiO2 lead to the increasing recombination of electron–hole pairs in the WO3 film. This finding suggests that most photogenerated electrons in TiO2 migrate to WO3, rather than reacting with O2, under UV irradiation, which is in good agreement with the observations of Tada et al.19
 Fig. 7  Visible photoinduced decomposition of CH3CHO for TiO2/WO3 and TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid films deposited at the quartz glass substrate before and after UV irradiation treatment decomposition. Insets show the change of transmittance before and after UV irradiation treatment. 
By contrast, the TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid films are not coloured under UV irradiation treatment, thus suggesting that all photogenerated electrons in TiO2 are accumulated into the Pt nanoparticles, which may firstly transfer into WO3 and then transfer to the Pt nanoparticles. When these non-coloured TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid films are placed under visible light, we cannot find any obvious difference in the photocatalytic activity before and after UV irradiation treatment by evaluating the CH3CHO decomposition. The results strongly suggest that the photoexcited electrons in TiO2 under UV irradiation are transferred to the Pt nanoparticles, which have no obvious influence on the separation of electron–hole pairs in WO3 under visible light.
4 Conclusions
A TiO2 film with high visible-light photocatalytic activity was successfully realized by a hybrid TiO2/Pt/WO3 film structure, where Pt nanoparticles were loaded at the interface of the TiO2 and WO3 films. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated based on the decomposition of CH3CHO under visible-light irradiation. The loading of Pt nanoparticles obviously improves the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2/WO3 films, and the TiO2/Pt/WO3 film enables complete decomposition for a long time, similar to that of the Pt/WO3 film under visible-light irradiation. The storage of electrons in the Pt nanoparticles was also confirmed by evaluating the visible-light-induced CH3CHO decomposition before and after UV irradiation treatment. Moreover, the water contact angle of TiO2/Pt/WO3 hybrid films is below 5° under visible-light irradiation. Such high hydrophilic thin films with visible light activity are expected to apply to various indoor products possessing self-cleaning and anti-fogging properties.
