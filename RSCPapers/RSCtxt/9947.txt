    , Accepted 4th October 2013First published on 7th October 2013AbstractThis paper reports an inverted solar cell with ZnO nanorods for electron collection. Because ZnO materials could function as the electron transport layer in inverted organic solar cells, the ZnO nanorods further provided a large number of carrier extraction channels deep inside the organic active layer to improve carrier collection efficiency. The relationship between the ZnO nanorod array morphology and the device performance was systematically studied. Different ZnO nanorod morphologies could be controlled by the ratio of zinc nitrate and hexamethylenetetramine in a low-cost hydrothermal method, including the average spacing between individual nanorods and the surface area. For a maximum organic–inorganic contact area and good polymer infiltration, the morphology of the ZnO nanorod array has been optimized. When the ratio of zinc nitrate and hexamethylenetetramine was controlled at 1.0:0.6 in the growth-promoting solution, the surface area of the nanorod array was 7.55 times more than a planar ZnO structure. The ZnO nanorods significantly enhanced the performance of inverted PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM solar cells and the power conversion efficiency of the device increased from 5.22% to 7.26%.
Introduction
Solar energy, with its features of inexhaustibility and cleanness, is the most promising technology for solving the energy crisis and achieving sustainable development in the future. Among the various kinds of solar cells, organic-based solar cells are regarded as the next generation of technology that will replace silicon-based cells due to the advantages of low cost, light weight, and mechanical flexibility.1–3 Recently, research on organic solar cells of the inverted structure, which avoids using acidic PEDOT:PSS and easily oxidized aluminum electrode,4–6 has gradually risen because the device stability is superior to the conventional structure.7,8 The general methods for improving device efficiency that have been reported mainly focused on morphology control in the bulk heterojunction active layer, like pre/post annealing,9,10 using additives,11,12 slow drying,13 and the application of an electric field.14 However, the effective active layer region in which carriers can be utilized fully is hard to increase due to the organic material nature of short carrier diffusion length. Many reports which attempted to solve this problem indicated that an inorganic nanostructure can help extract carriers more efficiently in organic solar cells.15–17 In inverted organic solar cells, transparent, nontoxic, and low-cost ZnO is widely used as the buffer layer on the device cathode.18–21 The ZnO thin film not only modified the connection between the Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) and the active layer to reach ohmic contact,22 but also assisted electron transport because of band matching,23,24 as shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, ZnO nanorod arrays are ideal nanostructures for the improvement of carrier extraction in inverted structural organic solar cells.25,26 ZnO nanorods can penetrate deeply into the active layer, providing carrier extraction channels for organic materials and reducing the probability of carrier recombination. This method can effectively improve the problem of short carrier diffusion length in organic materials27–29 to enhance the device power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, few reports have systematically investigated the relationship of the ZnO nanorod morphology and the device performance of low-bandgap polymer solar cells.30

On the other hand, some methods have been reported on the fabrication of the ZnO structure, including chemical vapor deposition,31 metal–organic chemical vapor deposition,32 pulsed laser deposition,33 and the hydrothermal method.34 Among them, the hydrothermal method is the most promising one for the fabrication of organic solar cells with regard to the goal of a low-cost and low-temperature process. In order to increase the active layer region with good inter-penetrating nano-network, the morphology control of a hydrothermally grown ZnO nanorod array as a buffer layer on the device cathode was studied. In practical use, the contact area between the ZnO nanorods and the active layer has a positive relationship with device performance. The spacing between nanorods must be controlled due to the condition of viscous organic active ink infiltration. Therefore, the organic–inorganic contact was optimized in order to perform carrier extraction efficiently and reduce the probability of carrier recombination35–37 caused by surface states.
In this work, a method for effectively controlling the ZnO nanorod array morphology was found. The ZnO nanorod array morphology parameters, including length, diameter, spacing, and density, could be controlled by adjusting the ratio of zinc nitrate and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) in a growth-promoting solution. We also found that the contact area between ZnO nanorods and the active layer could be maximized by using this morphology control method and the condition of the active ink infiltration could be improved. The ZnO nanorod array with the optimized contact area provided a large number of carrier extraction channels. The low band gap material of PBDTTT-C-T,38 which is reported to have high absorption and excellent carrier mobility, was used as the electron donor, and PC71BM as the electron acceptor in the active layer to verify the morphology control effect of the ZnO nanorod array on the performance of organic solar cells. After applying a ZnO nanorod array with its appropriate morphology to inverted organic solar cells, the device PCE increased from 5.22% to 7.26%.
Experimental
The device was fabricated on a cleaned ITO-coated glass substrate. The ZnO sol–gel was deployed by mixing zinc acetate dehydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.0%) in 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH) (Alfa Aesar, 99%) and ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH) and then spin-coated onto the substrate. After annealing at 200 °C for 45 min, the ZnO seed layer formed. The hydrothermal growth of a ZnO nanorod array was achieved by immersing the ZnO seed layer in a growth-promoting solution that was prepared with zinc nitrate, HMT, and DI water. Different ratios of zinc nitrate and HMT were used, including 1:1.2, 1:1.0, 1:0.8, 1:0.7, 1:0.6, 1:0.5, and 1:0.4, to prepare the growth-promoting solutions for the morphology control of the ZnO nanorod array. All recipes maintained at a concentration of 60 mM and all processes were implemented at 90 °C for 80 min. To fabricate the solar cell devices, the active layer material PBDTTT-C-T/PC71BM (with a weight ratio of 1:1.5) was dissolved in the 1,2-dichlorobenzene–chlorobenzene mixed solvent (with a volume ratio of 1:1) with 3% additive solvent of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). The active layer was formed by spin-coating the active ink onto the surface of the ZnO nanorod array. Then, all of the devices were fabricated with 3 nm molybdenum oxide (MoOx) as a thermally deposited hole-transport layer. Finally, the 250 nm Ag, as the back electrode, was deposited by thermal evaporation in a vacuum of 3 × 10−6 Torr. The schematic structure of the device is shown in Fig. 2.

The device current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were investigated with a Keithley 2400 source under AM 1.5 G irradiation calibrated at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 using a solar simulator SUN 2000, Abet Technologies, Inc. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images observed with a LEO 1530 FE-SEM were used to measure the ZnO nanorod array morphology in order to realize the hydrothermal growth results.
In addition, software ImageJ was utilized to calculate the average nanorod diameter, length, and density, and the average spacing between individual rods. To calculate the average nanorod length, 7 measured points with the equal distance between two adjacent points were used, as shown in the SEM image of Fig. 3(a). Then the 7 measured values were averaged to obtain the average nanorod length. Moreover, to further quantify the average diameters and the density of nanorods, we used the “Threshold Color” and “Analyze Particle” functions in ImageJ to define the density and the average diameter of nanorods. For example, the nanorods in Fig. 3(b) are distinguished clearly by appropriate brightness control so that they can be quantified, as shown in Fig. 3(c). The average spacing between nanorods was defined by averaging 50 random sampling data from ImageJ to measure the different spacing formed by different hydrothermal growth environments.

Results and discussion
In the discussion of the influence of different hydrothermal growth environments on the morphology control of the ZnO nanorod array, the principle of the hydrothermal method has to be considered. Here are the hydrothermal method formulae reported by Vergés et al.39 (see eqn (1)). (CH2)6N4 + 6H2O ↔ 6HCHO + 4NH3(1.1) NH3 + H2O ↔ NH+4 + OH−(1.2) 2OH− + Zn2+ ↔ Zn(OH)2(1.3) (1.4)
The zinc nitrate is dissociated in the form of Zn2+ ions in water. After heating at 90 °C in an oven, the thermal decomposition of HMT slowly releases hydroxyl (OH−) ions that react with Zn2+ ions to form ZnO. ZnO nanorods grow in the form of hexagonal shape along the c-axis on the seed layer. When the proportion of zinc nitrate and HMT in the growth-promoting solution is adjusted, the morphology of the ZnO nanorod array is changed because of the change in the rate of the chemical reaction. At the same time, the average nanorod length and density could be influenced using this method without sacrificing its collimation. In the application of organic optoelectronics, the morphology parameters of the ZnO nanorod array, like nanorod diameter, length, spacing, and density, have a great impact on the device performance.
The results of controlling the morphology of the ZnO nanorod array could be confirmed by SEM images shown in Fig. 4. The hexagonal ZnO nanorods were grown by using the hydrothermal method. In a vertical view of the ZnO nanorod array, different morphology parameters, like nanorod diameter and the spacing of individual rods, were observed because of the different ratios of zinc nitrate and HMT in the growth-promoting solution. To realize the morphology change in the scientific view, ImageJ software was utilized to calculate the average nanorod length, diameter, spacing, and density. In Fig. 4(a), there was no ZnO nanorod in the planar structure. A uniform, thin ZnO film was fabricated using the sol–gel method. Subsequently, this thin film was used as a seed layer to grow the ZnO nanorod array by using the hydrothermal method, as seen in Fig. 4(b)–(h). In Fig. 4(b), the recipe of zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:0.4 was used to deploy the growth-promoting solution. The average ZnO nanorod diameter was 24.6 nm, and the nanorod density was 912 μm−2. The average spacing between individual rods was 34.3 nm, which was the largest in all of the recipes. In Fig. 4(c), the recipe of zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:0.5 was used. The average ZnO nanorod diameter was similar to Fig. 4(b). In Fig. 4(d), the recipe of zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:0.6 was used. The average spacing between rods was narrower than that in Fig. 4(c). However, the nanorod density was increased to 944 μm−2. In Fig. 4(e), the recipe of zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:0.7 was used. The average spacing between rods is narrower than that in Fig. 4(d). In Fig. 4(f), the recipe of zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:0.8 was used. The average spacing between rods narrowed further, and the average nanorod diameter increased. In Fig. 4(g), the HMT proportion was further raised. The average nanorod diameter increased significantly, leading to the lower nanorod density and narrower spacing between rods. Finally, in Fig. 4(h), the recipe of zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:1.2 was used. The average nanorod diameter increased further to 60.9 nm. The nanorod density was the lowest in all of the recipes. Some regions exhibit the overlapping phenomenon because the spacing between individual rods was not large enough for horizontal growth. The full results are listed in detail, as shown in Table 1.

Adjusting the proportion of zinc nitrate and HMT in a growth-promoting solution also influenced the growth rate in the vertical direction to form a ZnO nanorod array with different nanorod lengths. The experimental results were observed through SEM images with a side view, as shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5(a), the ZnO seed layer fabricated by the sol–gel method was for further hydrothermal growth. In Fig. 5(b), the recipe of zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:0.4 was used. After growing for a fixed amount of time, the average nanorod length was less than 100 nm. In Fig. 5(c)–(g), the results indicated that the average nanorod length increased by increasing the proportion of HMT in the growth-promoting solution due to an increase in the growth rate in a vertical direction in hydrothermal growth. Finally, in Fig. 5(h), the average nanorod length was increased to 178 nm when the recipe of zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:1.2 was used.

As the SEM images shown in Fig. 4 and 5, we investigated the different ZnO nanorod array morphologies fabricated using different growth-promoting solution recipes. However, when adjusting the growth environment, several morphology parameters, including average nanorod diameter, length, spacing, and density, were influenced at the same time. Therefore, for the investigation of contact and interface issues in the application of organic optoelectronics, all parameters needed to be quantified. After systematically experimenting with different ratios of zinc nitrate and HMT, we utilized ImageJ software to calculate the average nanorod diameter, length, density, and spacing from the SEM images in a vertical view and a side view, as shown in Fig. 4 and 5, respectively. The full results are listed in detail, as shown in Table 1.
The ZnO nanorod array model with ideal hexagonal columns and perfect rod collimation was constructed, as shown in Fig. S1.† Compared to the planar structure (i.e. only the seed layer), the surface area of the sidewall of the ZnO nanorods significantly increased. In this model, the length of sides in hexagons can be obtained by dividing the average nanorod diameter by 2. The side area of columns can be calculated from its length of sides multiplying by the average rod length, then again multiplying by 6. Finally, the total surface area increased (lateral area of ZnO nanorods), estimated from multiplying the side area of columns by the nanorod density (see eqn (2)). The additional surface area in all of the recipes was calculated using the data shown in Tables 1 and 2. (A/2) × B × 6 × C = lateral area of ZnO nanorods(2)A is the average diameter of ZnO nanorods, B is the average length of ZnO nanorods and C is the density of ZnO nanorods (per μm2).

The different ratios of zinc nitrate and HMT in the growth-promoting solution can effectively control the morphology of the ZnO nanorod array. Subsequently, the ZnO nanorod array was applied in organic solar cells. The devices were fabricated with an inverted structure and utilized the ZnO nanorod array as an electron transport layer. The device performance and all solar cell parameters are shown in Table 3. The J–V curve is shown in Fig. 6. In the planar device, using a ZnO seed layer as an electron transport layer on the cathode, the device open-circuit voltage (VOC) was 0.78 V and PCE was 5.22%. After applying the ZnO nanorod array, the short-circuit current (JSC) increased significantly, from 11.4 mA cm−2 to over 15 mA cm−2, causing PCE to increase from 5.22% to over 6%. The device performance depended on different ratios of zinc nitrate and HMT in the growth-promoting solution. According to these experimental results, the device PCE had an apparent positive relationship with JSC. JSC increased when the proportion of HMT was gradually lowered. After reaching the maximized JSC value with zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:0.6, the JSC started to decrease. Another observation showed that the fill factor (FF) of the device with the ZnO nanorod array grown in high HMT proportion was lower than that with a planar structure.

 Fig. 6  The J–V curves of all devices. 
The ZnO nanorod array provided a large number of carrier extraction channels deep inside the active layer. It indicated that the short carrier transport length may improve. The carriers produced by the photovoltaic effect in an active layer were utilized efficiently, and the effective active layer region increased, resulting in a significant increase in JSC. The ability to improve carrier extraction by applying a ZnO nanorod array was demonstrated with the device absorption, external quantum efficiency (EQE), and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) diagrams, as shown in Fig. 7. The solar cell device, fabricated using the optimum recipe of zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:0.6 in the ZnO nanorod array through hydrothermal growth, had a strong capability of carrier utilization in the wavelength range of 600–750 nm with nearly 90% IQE. As shown in Fig. 8, the IQE comparison between the nanorods and planar structure, the devices applied with ZnO nanorod array showed better carrier extraction capability in most wavebands, and as a result, reflected excellent JSC performance.

 Fig. 8  The internal quantum efficiency of the devices fabricated using zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:0.6 and a planar structure (w/o ZnO nanorods). 
All of the device performance results are listed in Table 3. The device PCE results and the increase in the surface area (i.e. lateral area of ZnO nanorods in Table 2) are combined and illustrated in Fig. 9. In addition, the relationship of JSC results and the estimated increase in the surface area is shown in Fig. 10. The estimated increase in the surface area was the quantified result of compounding the factors of the average nanorod diameter, length, density, and average spacing between individual rods. In Fig. 9 and 10, both the PCE and the JSC had a highly positive relationship with the increase in the estimated surface area of the ZnO nanorod array. The maximum value of PCE, JSC and the increase in surface area of the ZnO nanorod array were all located at zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:0.6. The results showed that the increase in the surface area provided enough carrier transport channels in the organic active layer, optimizing the utilization of the active layer carriers. When the proportion of HMT was lower than 0.6 (set zinc nitrate is 1.0), the average nanorod length and diameter decreased slightly, resulting in the reduction of the nanorod density. If the HMT proportion was too low, the ZnO crystallization was limited. For these reasons, the ability to utilize the carrier in the active layer went down when the estimated surface area decreased. Consequently, the improvement of the short current by applying the ZnO nanorod array in organic solar cells was limited. When the HMT proportion was higher than 0.6 (set zinc nitrate was 1.0), the average nanorod diameter and length increased. However, the total surface area went down because of a significant reduction in the nanorod density. Therefore, the device JSC and PCE decreased.

In Fig. 9, although the device PCE and the increase in the surface area of the ZnO nanorods exhibited a similar trend, they did not fully coincide. The results of zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:0.7 and 1.0:0.6 indicated a similar increase in the surface area of the ZnO nanorod array, but the solar cell performance of zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:0.7 was poor. To explain the phenomenon, the issue of spacing between individual rods needed to be investigated. In the organic solar cell application, considering that the organic active ink had a high viscosity, the active ink infiltration condition had a great influence on device performance. If the active ink did not infiltrate well into nano-scaled spacing between the rods, the organic and inorganic materials would make poor contact. The good organic–inorganic contact area was lower than what we expected. In addition, the interspaces between the ZnO nanorods and the organic materials formed a large number of trap states, increasing the probability of carrier recombination. Consequently, the contact area and active ink infiltration between the ZnO nanorods and the active layer were both required for the increase in the effective region of the active layer.
In Fig. 10, JSC increased significantly when the proportion of zinc nitrate:HMT was lowered than 1.0:0.6, because the organic–inorganic contact area had a positive relationship with JSC and there was enough spacing between the nanorods to create a condition of excellent active layer infiltration. If the HMT proportion was too low, such as zinc nitrate:HMT = 1:0.4, the average spacing between nanorods was enough to generate active ink infiltration. However, the average nanorod diameter and length were too short and created an insufficient surface area. As a result, the increase in JSC was limited because carrier extraction channels provided by the ZnO nanorod array were lacking. When the HMT proportion was higher than 0.6, the average spacing between rods was reduced to less than 22.7 nm, as shown in Table 1. An organic solution with a high viscosity could not completely infiltrate when the spacing between the rods was too narrow to cover the entire surface of the ZnO nanorod array. As a result, the organic–inorganic contact area was lower than the theoretical expectation. Moreover, the poor contact condition with air residues, causing a high possibility of carrier recombination. Therefore, the JSC and PCE of the solar cell device decreased when larger HMT proportions were used to deploy a growth-promoting solution for hydrothermal growth.
The FF exhibited a trend that was similar to the JSC, because the surface defects of the ZnO nanorod array surface that was fabricated using the hydrothermal method were greater than that of the thin film formed by using the sol–gel method. The carriers had a high recombination possibility due to surface states. The interspaces on the boundary of the active layer and the ZnO nanorods formed a great number of surface states. Therefore, devices with a ZnO nanorod array generally had a slightly poorer FF than those with a planar structure. However, after modulating proper recipes of growth-promoting solution, the morphologies of the ZnO nanorod array became more suitable for active ink infiltration. Therefore, the FF improved because carrier transport and collection were enhanced. The optimized devices even exhibited better performance than the planar structural devices, with an FF of 58.7%. After the improvement of the condition of the active layer infiltration, the FF of devices with the ZnO nanorod array improved from 54.6% to over 59.0%.
The condition of the active layer infiltration was confirmed by the SEM images of the side view, as shown in Fig. 11. Fig. 11(a) is the side view of the ZnO nanorod array fabricated with the recipe of zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:1.0. The spin coated organic active layer on the ZnO nanorod array is shown in Fig. 11(b). The boundary between the ZnO nanorod array and the active layer was clear. Apparently, the narrow spacing between rods cannot make viscous organic active ink infiltrate well, therefore, causing poor organic–inorganic contact. Fig. 11(c) and (d) show the corresponding side views with the recipe of zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:0.6. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 11(d), the organic active ink well infiltrated into the spacing between the individual rods. It is obvious that the ZnO nanorod array fabricated with zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:0.6 in hydrothermal growth provided more suitable spacing between rods to facilitate active layer infiltration. Therefore, the effect of carrier extraction can be improved to reach the theoretical expectation and the solar cell performance can be improved.
 Fig. 11  The active layer infiltration in the ZnO nanorod array fabricated using different ratios of zinc nitrate and HMT in hydrothermal growth. When the spacing between rods is narrow, the organic infiltration condition is poor. When the spacing between rods is large, the organic materials infiltrate well. (a.) ZnO nanorods (zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:1.0) w/o a spin-coated active layer. (b) ZnO nanorods (zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:1.0) with a spin-coated active layer. (c) ZnO nanorods (zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:0.6) w/o a spin-coated active layer. (d) ZnO nanorods (zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:0.6) with a spin-coated active layer. 
Conclusions
In conclusion, the morphology of the ZnO nanorod array can be controlled by the hydrothermal growth environment including average nanorod diameter, length, and density and the spacing between rods. The morphology parameters were considered to calculate the increase in the surface area. In the application of organic solar cells, the JSC and PCE of the device were improved significantly by optimizing the organic–inorganic area of contact and the condition of the active-material infiltration. The performance of the inverted PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM polymer solar cells was successfully improved by using zinc nitrate:HMT = 1.0:0.6 in a hydrothermal growth-promoting solution. The JSC increased from 11.4 mA cm−2 to 16.8 mA cm−2, and the PCE was enhanced from 5.22% to 7.26%.
