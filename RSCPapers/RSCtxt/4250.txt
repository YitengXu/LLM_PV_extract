    , Accepted 4th April 2012First published on 13th April 2012AbstractHerein, a new nanocomposite consisting of up-conversion (UC) material (YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+), TiO2 (P25) and graphene (GR) has been prepared and shown to be an advanced sunlight activated photocatalyst. During the facile hydrothermal method, the reduction of graphene oxide and loading of YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+ and P25 were achieved simultaneously, and the functionalities of each part were integrated together. The as-prepared ternary UC–P25–GR nanocomposite photocatalyst exhibited great adsorptivity of dyes, a significantly extended light absorption range, efficient charge separation properties and superior durability. Indeed, the photocatalytic activity of this novel ternary nanocomposite under sunlight was improved compared with those of P25–GR nanocomposites and bare P25. Overall, this work could provide new insights into the fabrication of ternary composites as high performance photocatalysts and facilitate their application in environmental protection issues.
1. Introduction
As the most investigated functional material in semiconductor photocatalysis, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been widely used in the fields of energy conversion and environmental pollutant degradation owing to its non-toxicity, effectiveness, low cost, and chemical stability.1–4 For pure TiO2, under ultraviolet (UV) illumination electrons are excited from the valence band to the conduction band, forming electron–hole pairs, which are responsible for the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.5 The main drawbacks of TiO2 that greatly limit its practical applications are the fast recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and the narrow optical response, being limited to UV light.6 Therefore, many attempts have been made to improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 by inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and extending the optical absorption to the visible light region. For instance, to extend the optical absorption of TiO2, surface modification,7,8 structure optimization9 and doping of metal10 or nonmetal elements11,12 are the common routes. Meanwhile, deposition of noble metals on the TiO2 surface,13,14 formation of a composite with a semiconductor,15,16 utilization of electron donors–acceptors and hole scavengers17,18 are typical approaches to retard the bulk and surface recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in TiO2 during a photocatalytic process.
Recently, particular attention has been paid to the coupling of graphene with TiO2 which has shown a significant improvement of the photoelectrochemical catalytic ability owing to the superior charge transport properties, the intense light absorption and the unique flexible sheet-like structure of the graphene component.19–25 Due to the excellent electrical conductivity for storing and shuttling electrons, graphene is considered as an ideal platform for scavenging photogenerated electrons when in contact with TiO2.26,27 Furthermore, these graphene-based composites also show an improving adsorption for organic dyes and an extended light absorption range.19,28 Despite all the advantages, these TiO2 (or Degussa P25)/graphene nanocomposites prepared using different recipes still suffer from a key factor that limits the photocatalytic activity under solar irradiation, i.e. the low-usage of natural sunlight. Compared with the pure TiO2 and Degussa P25 nanoparticles, the efficient photocatalysis of these TiO2 (or Degussa P25)/graphene nanocomposites also responds only to UV light and a rather limited part of the visible light region. However, the percentage of UV light in the solar spectrum is only 5%, which is extremely low compared to that of visible light (∼48%) and near-infrared (NIR) light (∼44%).29 Therefore, the modification of TiO2 to reduce its band gap and make it sensitive to the longer-wavelength light is one of the most important objectives in related realms. Unfortunately, a large fraction of the NIR of sunlight remains untapped for photocatalysis. Recently, several incorporations of up-conversion (UC) agents with TiO2 were reported to extend the absorption edge up to the visible region or even the NIR region by UC luminescence of rare earths. For example, Qin et al. had reported a near-infrared photocatalysis based on YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+/TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles, which showed an effective photocatalysis under NIR light.29 However, the efficient utilization of light was limited because the light could not penetrate the UC nanocrystal cores. Moreover, the problem of a fast recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in these simple hybrid UC–TiO2 core–shell structures could not be ignored as they affected the photocatalytic efficiency.
In this work, we utilize both the up-conversion luminescence of UC materials and the excellent electrical properties of graphene to design a new advanced-sunlight-activated photocatalyst. Benefiting from the high specific surface area and the flexible sheet-like structure, graphene emerged as an excellent platform on which to load both UC nanocrystals and TiO2 nanoparticles to form UC material–P25–graphene (UC–P25–GR) ternary nanocomposites which can achieve a uniform distribution of these loaded nanomaterials without aggregation. As illustrated in Scheme 1, in this photocatalyst, the loading of UC nanocrystals is expected to emit UV light after absorbing NIR light of the solar spectrum and the optical response of the UC–P25–GR nanocomposites is enhanced from UV to NIR. As for the P25 nanoparticles, TiO2 is activated to form photogenerated electron–hole pairs after absorbing the UV light, along with parts of the violet-blue light (caused by the chemical bonds of Ti–O–C existing in the composites and the good transparency of graphene19), from the sunlight directly and from the secondary energy transferred from the UC nanocrystals. In addition, graphene could act as an acceptor of the photogenerated electrons by P25 and ensure fast charge transportation in view of its high conductivity. The introduction of graphene will not only accelerate the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, but also enhance the adsorption capacity of the photocatalyst. Consequently, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 could realize a considerable improvement under solar irradiation.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Catalyst preparation
First, graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized from graphite powder by the modified Hummer's method30 using a mixture of H2SO4, NaNO3, and KMnO4. A previous graphite oxidation procedure with H2SO4, K2S2O8, and P2O5 was carried out before the synthesis of GO. Second, YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanocrystals were prepared by a simple hydrothermal method.31 YCl3·6H2O (1.59 mmol), YbCl3·6H2O (0.4 mmol), TmCl3·6H2O (0.01 mmol) were dissolved in distilled water. Then hydrofluoric acid (40%) was added dropwise to form a colloidal solution under stirring. After reacting at 130 °C for 20 h, the product was isolated by centrifugation and dried at 60 °C, then annealed at 500 °C for 1 h under an argon atmosphere. The UC–P25–GR composite was obtained via a hydrothermal method based on Rajamathi's work, with modifications.32 In detail, 4 mg of GO was dissolved in a solution of distilled H2O (20 mL) and ethanol (10 mL) by ultrasonic treatment for 1 h, then 0.2 g of P25 (Degussa) and 0.1 g YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanocrystals were added into the obtained GO solution and stirred for another 2 h to get a homogeneous suspension. The suspension was then placed in a 50 mL Teflon-sealed autoclave and maintained at 200 °C for 6 h to simultaneously achieve the reduction of GO and the deposition of P25 and UC on the graphene support. Finally, the resulting composite was recovered by filtration, rinsed by deionized water several times, and dried at room temperature. For comparison, the P25–GR nanocomposite (prepared with the same content, 4 mg GO and 0.2 g P25) was obtained by reducing GO via a hydrothermal route under the same conditions, but without the addition of UC materials. Another reference sample, the UC–P25 sample, was obtained by mixing the UC materials (0.1 g YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanocrystals) with P25 (0.2 g).
2.2 Characterization
The crystal structures of the as-prepared samples were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using the Cu Kα radiation. The morphologies and microstructures of the samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, JSM-6360) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM2100) with an energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired at room temperature using a fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi F-4500) under the excitation of a 980 nm diode laser. The absorption spectra were measured under the diffuse reflection mode using a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer.
Photoelectrochemical test systems were composed of an CHI 660D Electrochemistry workstation, a 980 nm diode laser, and a homemade three-electrode cell using platinum as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and Na2SO4 (0.5 M) as the electrolyte. The working electrode was prepared on indium-tin oxide (ITO) conductor glass. The sample powder (10 mg) was ultrasonicated in 1 mL of anhydrous ethanol to disperse it evenly to get a slurry. The slurry was spread onto ITO glass whose side part was previously protected using Scotch tape. The working electrode was dried overnight under ambient conditions. A copper wire was connected to the side part of the working electrode using a conductive tape. Uncoated parts of the electrode were isolated with epoxy resin.
2.3 Photocatalytic experiments
The photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) dyes was observed based on the absorption spectroscopic technique. In a typical process, 30 mg of the photocatalyst (UC–P25–GR, P25–GR, UC–P25 or P25) was suspended in 100 mL of MO dyes in aqueous solution (0.02 g L−1) contained in a 100 mL cylindrical quartz vessel. Before irradiation, the suspensions were stirred in the dark for 1 h to ensure the establishment of an adsorption–desorption equilibrium. A 150 W high-pressure Xenon lamp (CHF-XM150W33,34) was placed 10 cm away from the reaction vessel, which was used to provide a full-spectrum emission with an AM 1.5 filter to simulate the sunlight source (the simulated sunlight system is from Beijing Trusttech Co. Ltd., China). The illumination intensity was 100 mW cm−2. Besides testing the performance of photocatalysts under simulated sunlight, the decomposition of MO was also carried out under a 980 nm laser to verify the photocatalytic activity of the samples under NIR irradiation. At given irradiation time intervals, 4 mL aliquots were sampled and centrifuged to remove remnant photocatalyst. Supernatant aliquots were subsequently analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy using the Lambda 25 spectrophotometer. In the durability test of the UC–P25–GR catalyst in the photodegradation of MO under simulated sunlight, four consecutive cycles were tested. At the beginning, 30 mg of UC–P25–GR was dispersed in 100 mL of MO solution (0.02 g L−1). Then the mixture underwent four consecutive cycles, each lasting for 60 min. After each cycle, the catalyst was filtrated and washed thoroughly with water, and then added into the fresh MO solution (0.02 g L−1). The percentage of degradation is reported as C/C0. Here, C is the absorption of dye solution at each irradiated time interval of the main peak of the adsorption spectrum, while C0 is the absorption of the initial concentration when the adsorption–desorption equilibrium is reached.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology characterizations
The powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the prepared UC–P25–GR nanocomposites was compared with those of UC nanocrystals (YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+) and P25 nanoparticles, as depicted in Fig. 1. The XRD pattern of the UC–P25–GR nanocomposites indicates that the sample is well crystallized. Meanwhile, it is easy to recognize that all diffraction peaks of the composite can be easily assigned to Y0.795Yb0.2Tm0.005F3 (which is indexed to orthorhombic YF3, JCPDS file no. 32-1431) and the pure P25 (which is indexed to anatase TiO2, JCPDS file no. 21-1272, and rutile TiO2, JCPDS file no. 21-1276). However, no diffraction peaks for carbon species were observed in the composite, which might be due to the low amount and relatively low diffraction intensity of graphene.

The morphologies and microstructures of the UC–P25–GR nanocomposites were characterized by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 2, the SEM images were conducted to reveal the morphological characteristics of different samples. Being regarded as the two construction units of the ternary composites, fine nanoparticles of P25 and cambiform-like morphologies of UC nanocrystals with uniform size were observed as in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. For comparison, the binary composite of P25 loading on the graphene was synthesized and it can be observed from the SEM image (Fig. 2(c)) that P25 nanoparticles are loaded on the high quality ultra-thin graphene layers derived from the solvothermal synthesis. As for the UC–P25–GR nanocomposites, it is clearly discerned that the graphene platform is covered by both the fine nanoparticles and the cambiform-like nanomaterials. The results propose that a ternary UC–P25–GR composite had been successfully prepared by our simple solvothermal process. Moreover, the uniform distribution of UC nanocrystals and P25 nanoparticles on graphene help both of them to absorb the light illumination directly in the photocatalytic process. For further detailed structure analysis, the characterization of the ternary nanocomposites was carried out by TEM equipped with SAED and EDS. Fig. 3 shows a typical TEM image of the ternary UC–P25–GR composites with a polycrystalline diffraction pattern and component analysis. The profile of a single TiO2 particle (which is assigned to B in this work) and part of cambiform-like UC nanocrystals aggregate (assigned to A) can be clearly distinguished, since the aggregation of these component units was well prevented with the benefit of the graphene carrier. Meanwhile, the fringe of graphene (assigned to C) can be explicitly identified, convincing us of the presence of graphene under the TiO2 and UC materials layer. The SAED pattern taken from a large area of the composite confirms the high quality of the graphene sheets derived from the solvothermal synthesis. Moreover, distinct electron diffraction patterns from the (101), (200) planes of anatase TiO2 and (121), (321) planes of YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+ were observed. The elemental mappings of the composites obtained by EDS also indicate that the atomic ratios of the elements are similar to the original molar ratio of the feed. The above results suggest that, as a robust and flexible supporter, graphene effectively combines the UC materials together with P25 nanoparticles with uniform distribution.

3.2 Optical characterization
Under the excitation of a 980 nm laser, the photoluminescence spectra of YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanocrystals were recorded to evaluate energy transformation of the UC material after absorbing IR light. As shown in Fig. 4, the emission peaks at 347 nm and 362 nm were assigned to 1I6 → 3F4 and 1D2 → 3H6 transitions, respectively, of Tm3+ ions doped in YF3 nanocrystals. Except the above mentioned UV emissions, two blue emission peaks at 452 nm and 476 nm come from the 1D2 → 3F4 and 1G4 → 3H6 transitions of Tm3+ ions. The UC emission of as-prepared YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanocrystals is roughly coincident with those in the literature.29,31 It is noteworthy that the intensity of UV emission is higher than those of the others which would be propitious to the efficient photocatalysis of the UC–P25–GR nanocomposites.

As mentioned above, the absorption range of light is a key factor in the photocatalysis. Therefore, UV-vis-NIR spectroscopic measurements were carried out to examine the optical response of UC–P25–GR nanocomposites and of the control samples. The absorption spectra (see ESI, Fig. S1†) indicate that the narrowing of the band gap of P25 occurred with the graphene introduction19 and does not disappear with the presence of UC nanocrystals. What's more, the as-prepared ternary nanocomposites exhibit a powerful absorption in the NIR region. By the way, the P25–GR composites also show NIR absorption, which is caused by the light absorption of graphene. As a result of the wondrous extended photo-responding range, an extremely efficient utilization of the solar spectrum could be achieved by the photocatalyst.
3.3 Photoelectrochemistry measurements
To ascertain the generation of electron–hole pairs in the UC–P25–GR nanocomposites under NIR light, photo-electrochemical experiments were performed. Fig. 5 displays the photocurrent transient response under 980 nm irradiation for UC–P25–GR, UC–P25, P25–GR and bare P25 electrodes, respectively. It is noteworthy that there is a fast and uniform photocurrent responding to each switch-on and switch-off event in the UC–P25–GR electrode. Moreover, the photocurrent is so stable that no obvious photocurrent decay is observed. In contrast, the photocurrent density for P25 is not existent at all. The P25–GR sample shows NIR absorption, but there scarcely exists any photo-response under the NIR irradiation. As for the UC–P25 sample, it exhibits a faint but legible photocurrent density which is much lower than the photocurrent density of the UC–P25–GR sample. The above photocurrent transient response suggested that, in the four kinds of electrodes, only the UC–P25 and UC–P25–GR samples, with the presence of UC, can respond to the NIR light. What's more, the photocurrent intensity of the UC–P25–GR is nearly 0.2 mA cm−3, a thousand times more than the density of UC–P25, and the sharp separation of electron–hole pairs with the introduction of GR21,27 is considered to contribute greatly to the generation of this strong photocurrent after absorbing the UV light emitted by UC material. In detail, as represented in Scheme 1, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs are generated after the P25 nanoparticles receive the secondary energy emitted by the UC nanocrystals under NIR irradiation, and the photocurrent grows fast due to the transport of photo-generated electrons. After the equilibration of competitive separation and recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, the photocurrent reaches a relatively high constant value. Thereby, a highly efficient photocatalytic activity under solar irradiation is to be expected.

3.4 Photocatalytic performance
The photocatalytic activities of P25, P25–GR, UC–P25 and UC–P25–GR were measured by the photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) as a model reaction under simulated sunlight. MO is considered as a suitable probe chemical for photocatalytic activity tests because MO would not sensitize TiO2.35 Before irradiation, a dark adsorption test was carried out to estimate the adsorptivity of UC–P25–GR nanocomposites. Fig. 6 displays bar charts that show the remaining solution of MO after reaching the adsorption equilibrium in the dark over the UC–P25–GR, P25–GR, UC–P25 and bare P25 photocatalysts. It was obvious that, after equilibrium in the dark for 1 h, most dye molecules remained in the solution with bare P25 or UC–P25 as the catalyst, whereas a large amount of dye molecules was adsorbed on the surface of P25–GR and UC–P25–GR. The enhanced adsorptivity was attributed to the introduction of graphene.28 As a prerequisite for good photocatalytic activity, the enhanced adsorptivity of the ternary nanocomposites would prefigure the advanced performance in the photodegradation of MO.

Under the simulated solar irradiation, it is evident from Fig. 7 that the UC–P25–GR composite showed significant improvements in the photodegradation of MO compared to P25, UC–P25 and P25–GR. As a reference substance, the photodegradation of MO without any photocatalyst was tested and no degradation of MO under the irradiation was verified. About 30% of MO molecules were degraded in the first 10 min with the aid of as-prepared UC–P25–GR nanocomposite; in contrast, only 12%, 7% and 4% MO molecules were degraded in the control reactions with P25–GR, UC–P25 and bare P25, respectively. Furthermore, after 60 min of simulated sunlight irradiation, more than 78% of the initial dyes were decomposed by UC–P25–GR. Contrastingly, only 53% and 46% of the initial contaminants diminished after 60 min for P25–GR and UC–P25, and nearly 73% of the initial dye still remained in the solution after the same time period for bare P25. Manifestly, this UC–P25–GR ternary composite photocatalyst presented here shows remarkable improvements in the photodegradation rate under solar irradiation. To test the stability of the UC–P25–GR catalyst for the degradation of MO under sunlight, the photodegradation of MO was monitored for four consecutive cycles, each for 60 min. From the cycling runs in the photodegradation of MO (see ESI, Fig. S2†), it was noted that no significant decrease was observed in the photodegradation rate during the four consecutive cycles, which indicates the good stability of the prepared UC–P25–GR photocatalyst. The UC–P25–GR samples also display the best catalytic activities compared to pure P25, UC–P25 and P25–GR on decomposing methylene blue under simulated solar irradiation (see ESI, Fig. S3†). To test the abilities of this new photocatalyst in real life, real wastewater from the dye industry was collected to evaluate photodegradation activity of the as-prepared photocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 8 and 9, it is clear that the UC–P25–GR possessed the best photocatalytic activities among these four photocatalysts under the same model photodegradation reaction. Furthermore, similar photocatalysis experiments were carried out under a 980 nm laser to check the photocatalytic activities of the P25, P25–GR, UC–P25 and UC–P25–GR under NIR light. Fig. 10 indicates that the UC–P25–GR photocatalyst have the best photocatalytic activity among these four samples under NIR irradiation.

4. Conclusion
In this work, we have demonstrated a new strategy by integrating the NIR-to-UV UC property of YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+ with the excellent electrical properties of graphene to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2. Following such ideas, a UC–P25–GR photocatalyst with high performance has been successfully and directly produced via a one-step hydrothermal method. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is associated with the large extended photoresponsive range, great adsorptivity of dyes and high electron–hole separation efficiency due to the synergetic interactions among TiO2, graphene and UC material. This work is anticipated to promote practical applications of photocatalysts under solar irradiation in addressing various environmental issues.
