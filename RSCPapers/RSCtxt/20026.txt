    , Accepted 5th April 2013First published on 8th May 2013AbstractThis study guided by device evaluations was conducted to reveal the reasons for the loss of the photo-generated carriers in CIGS cells with the buffer based on In2S3 derivatives. Chemical bath deposited Inx(OOH,S)y films have been employed as a Cd-free buffer layers. When compared to solar cells with CdS buffer layer, the Cu0.9(In0.7,Ga0.3)Se2.1 (Eg = 1.18 eV) cells with the Inx(OOH,S)y buffer exhibited strong voltage-dependent carrier collection and poor spectral response above 500 nm, presumably, due to energy barrier at the junction. In order to improve the charge collection by upward shift of the conduction band minimum of CIGS absorber, Inx(OOH,S)y/Cu0.9(In0.55,Ga0.45)Se2.1 (Eg = 1.30 eV) solar cells were also fabricated and their spectral responses were examined. When compared to the Cu0.9(In0.7,Ga0.3)Se2.1 cells, the improved spectral response and voltage dependent carrier collection were obtained. Nevertheless, considerable loss in charge collection above 500 nm was still observed. The efficiency reached 9.3% while the Cu0.9(In0.7,Ga0.3)Se2.1 cell exhibited only the efficiency of 3.4%. Finally, CIGS (Eg = 1.18 eV) solar cells with n-ZnO/i-ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y/CdS/CIGS and n-ZnO/i-ZnO/CdS/Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS configurations were fabricated. The influence of the TCO/buffer interface on the device characteristics was also addressed by means of comparison between the characteristics of two cells employing different interfaces. A 13.0% efficient cell has been achieved from n-ZnO/i-ZnO/CdS/Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS configuration. The obtained data suggested that the limitation of the device efficiency was mainly related to the i-ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y interface. The experimental results provide the knowledge base for further optimization of the interface properties to form high-quality p–n junction in the CIGS solar cells employing the CBD In2S3 buffer layer.
Introduction
Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS)-based thin films with a direct band gap and high absorption coefficient are one of the promising absorbing materials for thin film solar cells. Employing the co-evaporation of Cu, In, Ga, and Se elements through a three-stage process, CIGS solar cells of the conventional art have demonstrated a high potential in photovoltaics with laboratory cell efficiency exceeding 20%.1 In the high efficient CIGS solar cells CdS film grown by chemical bath deposition (CBD) is employed as the buffer layer. However, the CdS with a band gap of 2.45 eV limits the short-wavelength response of the device and therefore the short-circuit-current (Jsc). The replacement of the hazardous CdS buffer is also motivated by concerns of the environmental safety. The development of the wide band gap materials for the buffer layer application and the optimization of the electronic band structure at both the window/buffer and buffer/CIGS interfaces are key issues for increasing of the cell efficiency. The current research is focused particularly on the In2S3 derivative compounds as promising material for Cd-free buffer layer.2–13 The buffer layers are deposited using variety of methods such as physical vapour deposition (PVD)2–4 the atomic layer chemical vapour deposition (ALCVD),6,7 chemical bath deposition (CBD),5,8–11 and electrodeposition.12 The chemical composition of the In2S3 derivative compounds is affected by the deposition method and its experimental conditions. Depending on chemical composition the value of band gap can vary in the range of 1.97–3.70 eV. The application of the In2S3 and its derivatives such as Inx(OH,S)y as alternative buffers for a low band gap CIGS (Eg ∼1.18 eV) devices yielded the efficiencies in the range of 7.1 to 16.4%. ALCVD yields the efficiency up to 16.4% with conventional i-ZnO/ZnO:Al window layer deposited by RF sputtering,6 and 14.7% with electrodeposited ZnO:Cl single window layer.7 The solar cells based on a pentenary alloy system Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 (CIGSS) with CBD Inx(OOH,S)y buffer have shown an energy conversion efficiency of 12.6%.8 This efficiency is competitive to the best efficiency observed in wide band gap CIGSS solar cells of the conventional art.
However, the published experimental data on the subject are controversial and do not provide clear understanding of the impacts of the n-ZnO/i-ZnO/buffer and buffer/CIGS interfaces to the operation of Cd-free device employing the In2S3 derivative compounds. This work aims to address the above mentioned issues.
In our previous research, we have developed Inx(OOH,S)y buffer layer using CBD technique and characterized its structural, and optical properties.11 In this work, we applied the as-deposited Inx(OOH,S)y buffer as an alternative to the CdS in the standard CIGS solar cell configuration. We conducted a study guided by device characterizations to reveal the reasons for the loss of the photo-generated carriers and efficiency in CIGS solar cells with the buffer based on In2S3 derivatives. The experimental results were discussed in relation to the role of the energy band alignment at the ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS interfaces in the limitation of the device efficiency.
Experimental
CIGS solar cells based on Inx(OOH,S)y buffer layers were fabricated. To compare the PV properties of the Cd-free solar cells with the conventional CIGS, cells with a CdS layer were also prepared.
CIGS absorbers were deposited on molybdenum-coated soda-lime glasses by co-evaporation of In, Ga, Cu, and Se elemental sources. The atomic ratios Ga/(In + Ga) were 30 and 45%. The absorber compositions were determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The Inx(OOH,S)y and CdS buffer layers were grown on CIGS absorbers by the CBD technique. To complete a solar cell structure, a window layer that consists of i-ZnO (50 nm) and n-ZnO (500 nm) films was deposited using RF-magnetron sputtering. Finally, an Al top grid was formed using e-beam evaporation. The experimental details of the deposition procedures have been described in our previous publication.14
The depositions of Inx(OOH,S)y and CdS thin films were carried out in a home-made bath equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a Teflon substrate holder. A thermostat was used to adjust the bath temperature to the desired level.
The Inx(OOH,S)y thin films were grown on CIGS absorbers from acidic aqueous solution. The pH of the bath solution was adjusted to a value of 2.0 by acetic acid. The aqueous solution contained indium chloride (InCl3) and thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2) as indium and sulfide ions sources, respectively. The concentrations of InCl3 and CH3CSNH2 in the bath were 0.025 M and 0.1 M, respectively. CIGS substrates were dipped in the bath at 18 °C, and the bath was subsequently heated to 68 °C within 13 min. The deposition proceeded further for 20 min. Inx(OOH,S)y layers with the thickness of 60 nm were deposited on CIGS absorber.11
The CdS films were grown from the alkaline aqueous solutions containing cadmium sulfate (CdSO4) and thiourea [(NH2)2CS] as a cadmium and sulfide ions sources, respectively. An ammonia hydroxide solution (NH4OH) was used as a complexing agent. The concentrations of CdSO4, (NH2)2CS, and NH4OH in the bath were 0.0015 M, 0.05 M, and 1.5 M, respectively. The substrates were dipped in the bath at room temperature, and the bath was subsequently heated to 66 °C within 5–7 min. CdS layers with thickness in range of 40–50 nm were deposited on the CIGS absorber.
After the film depositions, the substrates were rinsed in deionized water with ultrasonic irradiation, and then dried in an argon flow.
CdSO4 (99.99%, Aldrich), InCl3 (98%, Aldrich), NH4OH (28%, Sigma-Aldrich), (NH2)2CS (>99.0%, ACS reagent, Sigma-Aldrich), CH3CSNH2 (≥99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich, ACS grade) and acetic acid (98%) were used without further purification.
Device characterization
Simulated AM1.5G spectrum was obtained with a Spectra Physics Oriel 300W Solar Simulator with AM1.5G filter set. The integrated intensity was set to 100 mW cm−2 using a thermopile radiant power meter (Spectra Physics Oriel, model 70260) with fused silica window, and verified with a Hamamatsu S1787-04 diode. Intensity was controlled to be constant throughout measurements with a digital exposure controller (Spectra Physics Oriel, model 68950). Short-circuit currents obtained under simulated AM1.5G illumination were well matched with those obtained by integrating the spectra of quantum efficiency (QE) data with the true AM1.5G solar emission spectrum.
Results and discussions

Fig. 1 shows plan-view and cross-sectional SEM images of Inx(OOH,S)y film on the CIGS film. The Inx(OOH,S)y surface exhibited a conglomerated morphology in which about 20 nm diameter particles were typically found. The thickness of the Inx(OOH,S)y film on the CIGS was controlled to about 60 nm (Fig. 1b) since it turned out that the CIGS surface was fully covered by that thickness. In contrast, the Inx(OOH,S)y films thicker than 100 nm were found to have a porous structure which may be harmful to the device performances of CIGS solar cells. The detail of Inx(OOH,S)y film growth by the CBD technique has been discussed in our previous work.11

CIGS solar cells with the Inx(OOH,S)y and CdS buffers were fabricated, and their PV properties were investigated. Fig. 2 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the CIGS solar cells with CdS buffer and Inx(OOH,S)y buffer under simulated AM1.5G illumination. The Ga/(Ga + In) ratio (x) in CIGS absorbers was adjusted to be 0.30 that yields a bulk band gap value of 1.18 eV.

The devices have demonstrated similar values of the open circuit voltage (Voc). However, the short circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of CIGS solar cell with Inx(OOH,S)y buffer are significantly smaller than that of the CIGS solar cell with the CdS buffer. The efficiency of the reference device is 16.6% while that of the cell with Inx(OOH,S)y buffer is only about 3.4%.

Fig. 3 shows the QE of the same cells as in Fig. 2 under short-circuit conditions. The CIGS solar cell with the CdS buffer showed a high QE of 80–85% in the range of 500–1050 nm, while the CIGS cell with the Inx(OOH,S)y buffer shows a poor QE especially in the wavelength range of 550–1050 nm. The spectral response decreases significantly as the wavelength increases. The considerable drop in the QE of the cell with Inx(OOH,S)y buffer suggests that the carrier transport across the n-ZnO/i-ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y/Cu0.9(In0.7,Ga0.3)Se2.1 heterojunction is considerably hindered and it indicates that the energy band alignment at the interfaces is unfavorable. Presumably, the carriers generated from the CIGS bulk cannot cross the high energy barrier between Inx(OOH,S)y and CIGS absorber. Whereas, in the standard CIGS cell configuration the energy band discontinuity at both interfaces n-ZnO/i-ZnO/CdS and CdS/CIGS are favorable for carrier transport.15 Indeed the reference device gives a high efficiency of 16.6% (Fig. 2). The replacement of the CdS buffer with the wide band gap Inx(OOH,S)y buffer can result not only in formation of the energy barrier at the Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS interface, but in poor PV properties of the n-ZnO/i-ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y interface as well. Both of them can block the carrier transport across heterojunction, and cause the sharp drop in the Jsc and FF.

To evaluate the influences of the optoelectronic properties of both the ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y and Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS interfaces on the limitation of the device efficiency we conducted the following studies.
1. Quantum efficiency spectra: the effects of the reverse bias
We facilitated the electron transport across the Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS interface by applying reverse bias. Fig. 4 shows the QE spectra measured under the short-circuit and reverse biased conditions of (a) CdS/Cu0.9(In0.7,Ga0.3)Se2.1 cell, and (b) Inx(OOH,S)y/Cu0.9(In0.7,Ga0.3)Se2.1 cell. The comparison of two devices can give useful information for understanding the reason of a low efficiency of the Cd-free solar cell.

Fig. 4a shows the spectral responses of the standard CdS/Cu0.9(In0.7,Ga0.3)Se2.1 solar cell under biased conditions (including 0 V). The spectral response of the reference cell does not depend on the reverse bias, indicating an unimpeded electron transport due to the favorable conduction band alignment at the CdS/Cu0.9(In0.7,Ga0.3)Se2.1. In contrast to the reference CIGS solar cell, the Inx(OOH,S)y/Cu0.9(In0.7,Ga0.3)Se2.1 cell shows a considerable improvement in the QE under the reverse bias (Fig. 4b). The QE of the Inx(OOH,S)y/Cu0.9(In0.7,Ga0.3)Se2.1 cell reveals the broadened spectral response and long wavelength falloff increases with the reverse voltage bias. Furthermore, this effect is enhanced with a further increase of the reverse bias, suggesting the voltage–dependence of the current collection efficiency. In fact, when the energy barrier is present, the charge transport across the barrier can be facilitated with applying a reverse bias.
2. Photovoltaic parameters of solar cells: the effect of Ga content
To facilitate the charge transport across the Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS interface by lowering the energy barrier we increased a value of Ga content in CIGS absorber. It has been reported elsewhere16,17 that the band gap of the quaternary alloy system of Cu(In1−xGax)Se2 varies with Ga content in the range of 1.04–1.67 eV and the band gap increases due to an upwards shift of the conduction band minimum (CBM), yielding the CBO value of 0.63 eV between CuInSe2 and CuGaSe2. At the same time, the upwards shift in VBM position of +0.15 eV upon alloying with Ga was found from the photoemission measurements by T. Schulmeyer et al.18 Given the shift in VBM position of +0.15 eV, the expected CBO value between CuInSe2 and CuGaSe2 can be estimated as 0.78 eV. Therefore, we can lower the energy barrier at the Inx(OOH,S)y/Cu0.9(In0.7,Ga0.3)Se2.1 interface by increasing the Ga content in the CIGS absorber. To conduct this experiment CIGS absorbers with x = 0.45 were prepared and Inx(OOH,S)y/Cu0.9(In0.55,Ga0.45)Se2.1 solar cells were fabricated. The Ga/(In + Ga) atomic ratio of 0.45 yields the bulk band gap value of about 1.30 eV. The conventional CIGS absorber has the bulk band gap value of 1.18 eV. Given that the CBO between CuInSe2 and CuGaSe2 is estimated as 0.78 eV, and the band gap increases due to the upwards shift of CBM, the expected decrease in the CBO value at the Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS interface is about 0.20 eV.

Fig. 5 shows the J–V characteristics (a) and QE spectra (b) of a Inx(OOH,S)y/Cu0.9(In0.55,Ga0.45)Se2.1 solar cell. Note Ga alloying ranging from 0.20 to 0.50 does not significantly affect the device performances of CdS/CIGS cells; nevertheless, commonly the best device performance from the CdS/CIGS cells would be obtainable with x = 0.30.19,20 The Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS junction appeared to have the energy barrier as suggested before and thus lowering the CBO between Inx(OOH,S)y and CIGS with higher Ga alloying may yield a better charge collection. Indeed as a result, the improved J–V characteristics have been obtained with x = 0.45 as shown in Fig. 5. The Cu0.9(In0.55,Ga0.45)Se2.1 cell with the Inx(OOH,S)y buffer has shown the increased values of the Voc (0.730 V) and FF (54.0%). Surprisingly, in spite of greater Ga/(In + Ga) ratio, the Jsc value of the CIGS cell (x = 0.45) with the Inx(OOH,S)y buffer is significantly greater than that of the CIGS cell (x = 0.30) by 53% (Fig. 5a). The efficiency reached 9.3% while the Cu0.9(In0.7,Ga0.3)Se2.1 cell exhibited only the efficiency of 3.4% (Fig. 2 and 5a).

Under the short-circuit conditions the cell with x = 0.45 shows a better spectral response than the CIGS cell with x = 0.30 (Fig. 4b). However, the effect of the reverse bias is small compared to the Inx(OOH,S)y/Cu0.9(In0.7,Ga0.3)Se2.1 cell and there is only small change in the QE under reverse-biased condition (Fig. 5b). The short wavelength falloff slightly increases under reverse voltage bias of −0.95 V. This result points out that still the carrier transport is partly limited by energy barrier at Inx(OOH,S)y/Cu0.9(In0.55,Ga0.45)Se2.1 interface; however, it also strongly suggests that only lowering the CBO between Inx(OOH,S)y and Cu0.9(In0.55,Ga0.45)Se2.1 partly helps to improve the charge collection. It can be rationalized that there is another mechanism limiting the carrier collection.
The data presented so far mainly focused on the buffer/CIGS interfaces; however, the n-ZnO/i-ZnO/buffer interface also should be paid a particular attention. As mentioned above, in the CdS/CIGS cell,15 the energy band alignments at both the n-ZnO/i-ZnO/CdS interface and CdS/CIGS interface are favorable and a high efficiency of 16.6% could be achieved (Fig. 2). The replacement of the CdS buffer with the wide band gap Inx(OOH,S)y buffer can result not only in the formation of the energy barrier at the Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS interface, but in a highly defective n-ZnO/i-ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y interface as well.
3. Effect of CdS interlayer on PV properties of Inx(OOH,S)y/Cu0.9(In0.7,Ga0.3)Se2.1 cell
To clarify the impact of optoelectronic properties at the n-ZnO/i-ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y and Inx(OOH,S)y/Cu0.9(In0.7,Ga0.3)Se2.1 interfaces in the device operation we studied the J–V characteristics of solar cells with the two configurations: ZnO/CdS/Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS and ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y/CdS/CIGS. Fig. 6 shows the illuminated J–V curves of (a) ZnO/CdS/Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS and (b) ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y/CdS/CIGS solar cells. The J–V values are also given as inset-tables. The CdS and Inx(OOH,S)y films were deposited with thicknesses of around 30 nm. The Ga/(Ga + In) ratio was adjusted to about 0.30. ZnO/CdS/Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS solar cells exhibit significantly improved J–V characteristics than those with only Inx(OOH,S)y buffer layer (Fig. 2). The Jsc and FF reach the values of 35.3 mA cm−2 and 58.5%, respectively. A 13.0% efficient cell has been achieved from this configuration.
 Fig. 6  
J–V characteristics of ZnO/CdS/Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS (x = 0.30) and ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y/CdS/CIGS (x = 0.30) solar cells under simulated AM1.5 illumination. 
In contrast, the device configuration of ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y/CdS/CIGS exhibits a poor device performance and its J–V behavior is similar to the cell with only Inx(OOH,S)y buffer (Fig. 2).
The significant improvement in the J–V characteristics by the insertion of the thin CdS interlayer between the i-ZnO and Inx(OOH,S)y buffer indicates that the i-ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y interface is the cause of the degradation of the device performance shown in Fig. 2 and 6b, presumably due to a highly defective interface or unfavorable alignment of energy levels.
The QE spectra under short-circuit conditions for solar cells with the two configurations (a) ZnO/CdS/Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS and (b) ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y/CdS/CIGS are shown in Fig. 7. The response of the ZnO/CdS/Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS cell is significantly higher compared to those of ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y/CdS/CIGS and ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS cells (Fig. 3). The QE curve shows the improved spectral response, and the long wavelength falloff significantly increases. The spectral response over 80% was recorded in the range of 500–700 nm. However, the response of the cell with the ZnO/CdS/Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS structure is still lower than the spectral response of the conventional ZnO/CdS/CIGS solar cell (Fig. 3). The QE decreases in the long wavelength region of 750–1100 nm. This result can be ascribed to the energy barrier at the Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS that negatively affects the carrier transport across the heterojunction. In case of the cell with the ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y/CdS/CIGS structure, it also shows slightly improved spectral response compared to that of ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS cell (Fig. 3), and it is interestingly similar to the QE of the ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS cell under −0.95 V condition. These results point out that the charge collection is only partly limited by the energy barrier at the buffer layer/absorber interface; however, the major factor of the loss is coming from the poor i-ZnO/buffer interface.
 Fig. 7  Quantum efficiency spectra ZnO/CdS/Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS (x = 0.30) and ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y/CdS/CIGS (x = 0.30) solar cells. 
The experimental data and their interpretations presented above corroborate the results obtained in our previously study,8 where a pentenary alloy system, Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 (CIGSS), was applied as a wide-gap absorber and Inx(OOH,S)y films were employed as the buffers. With this cell structure, we have already demonstrated a conversion efficiency of 12.55%. The band gap widening of an absorber layer appeared to positively affects CBO at the Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGSS interface. However, in our earlier study the ZnO layer deposited by MOCVD was used as a window for the CIGSS cells. Given that the cell showed high efficiency, the high quality MOCVD-ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y interface with suitable optoelectronic properties would be obtained. In this work the loss in the charge collection is very likely to be related to the poor properties of the ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y interface. We presume that the sputtering damage might deteriorate the surface of Inx(OOH,S)y film. Note that the window layer structure of n-ZnO(200 nm)/i-ZnO(50 nm), as well as the processing parameters of deposition by RF magnetron sputtering are well established for the CIGS cell of the conventional art with the CdS buffer. However, in our case the application of the same method for deposition of the window layer may cause the plasma damage of sputtering of the i-ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y interface.
Therefore, the obtained experimental results suggest that the limitation of the device efficiency is mainly related to unfavorable optoelectronic properties of the i-ZnO/buffer interface. The replacement of the CdS buffer with the wide band gap Inx(OOH,S)y buffer can result not only in the formation of the energy barrier at the Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS interface, but in an highly defective ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y interface with negative CBO, which leads to the decrease in the device efficiency.21
Conclusions
CIGS solar cells with the Inx(OOH,S)y buffer layers exhibited poor PV properties as compared to the conventional device with a CdS buffer layer. The QE measurements suggested that an unfavorable band alignment at the Inx(OOH,S)y/CIGS interface partly decreased the device performances. Indeed the lowering of energy barrier at the interface due to upwards shift of the CBM of absorber with higher Ga alloying (Ga/(In + Ga) = 0.45) yields a better charge collection.
However, in experiments with double-layered buffer (i.e. CdS/Inx(OOH,S)y and Inx(OOH,S)y/CdS), the i-ZnO/Inx(OOH,S)y interface was found to be the major limiting factor for the performances of the CIGS solar cells with the Inx(OOH,S)y buffer.
Therefore, our results strongly suggested that the optoelectronic properties of the TCO/buffer interface require such close control as the properties of the buffer/CIGS interface.
Thus the chemical bath deposited wide-band-gap Inx(OOH,S)y buffer layer is a promising buffer for wide band gap CIGSS solar cells. However, for its exploration in low band gap CIGS devices the modification of its chemical composition (e.g. by heat treatment) and adjustment of the window deposition step are required.
