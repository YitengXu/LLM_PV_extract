    , Accepted 28th March 2012First published on 29th March 2012AbstractNanostructured WO3 has been developed as a promising water-splitting material due to its ability of capturing parts of the visible light and high stability in aqueous solutions under acidic conditions. In this review, the fabrication, photocatalytic performance and operating principles of photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) for water splitting based on WO3 photoanodes, with an emphasis on the last decade, are discussed. The morphology, dimension, crystallinity, grain boundaries, defect and separation, transport of photogenerated charges will also be mentioned as the impact factors on photocatalytic performance.
1. Introduction
To effectively retard the depletion of fossil energy resources and alleviate the serious environmental problems arising from the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere, scientists are becoming increasingly devoted to the exploitation of renewable energy sources. The semiconductor-based generation of hydrogen via water splitting using solar irradiation has attracted great attention since the first report of photoelectrochemical water splitting was published by Honda and Fujishima in 1972.1 A device integrated with photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical cells achieved a photon-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 12.4%.2 Nanostructure-based transition-metal oxides are becoming increasingly important for collecting and storing solar energy into chemical bonds.3–22 Photoanodes based on n-type metal oxides such as TiO2,23–50 α-Fe2O351–91 and WO3 have been intensely studied due to their high chemical stability at appropriate pH values, low cost and environment friendliness. This review will focus on efforts over the last 10 years to develop an efficient WO3-based photoelectrochemical water-splitting device.
2. Crystal structures of WO3
The simplest crystal structure of WO3 is referred to the “ideal” cubic (ReO3 type) and described as the three-dimensional networks of corner-sharing WO6 octahedra. However, cubic WO3 is seldom observed experimentally. The common WO3 displays a little distorted structures compared with cubic WO3, classified into following five forms: tetragonal (α-WO3),92 orthorhombic (β-WO3),93 monoclinic I (γ-WO3),94,95 triclinic (δ-WO3)96,97 and monoclinic II (ε-WO3).98 The stable temperature domains of the five forms WO3 are: tetragonal (α-WO3, > 740 °C) → orthorhombic (β-WO3, 330 °C to 740 °C) → monoclinic I (γ-WO3, 17 °C to 330 °C) → triclinic (δ-WO3, −43 °C to 17 °C) → monoclinic II (ε-WO3, < −43 °C).99 At room temperature, the monoclinic I (γ-WO3) is the most stable phase in bulk WO3. To some extent, a hexagonal (h-WO3) reported by Gerand et al. is also stable, however, the hexagonal (h-WO3) will be transformed into a monoclinic I (γ-WO3) when annealed at the temperature exceeding 400 °C.100 The phase transition behavior of nanostructure-based WO3 is quite different from that of bulk WO3, the morphology of the nanostructured WO3 significantly affects stable crystal phases at room temperature, the phase transition temperatures are generally lower than that of bulk WO3. The orthorhombic crystal phase can be retained in some nanostructured WO3 at room temperature.101–103
3. Optoelectronic characteristics and basic principles of the photocatalytic water splitting of WO3
WO3 is an indirect band gap semiconductor (Eg ≈ 2.5–2.8 eV) that can capture approximately 12% of the solar spectrum and can absorb light in the visible spectrum up to 500 nm. Given its band gap, WO3 is a more suitable material for photoelectrochemical water splitting than TiO2 (Eg ≈ 3.0–3.2 eV). TiO2 absorbs only in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum and captures approximately 4% of solar irradiation. The theoretical maximum conversion efficiency of solar energy into H2 is only 2.2% in a photoelectrochemical water-splitting device using TiO2 as a photoanode104 and is approximately 4.8% using WO3 as a photoanode. WO3 exhibits high resistance against photocorrosion and good chemical stability in acidic aqueous solutions (pH < 4) under solar illumination. In addition, WO3 has a moderate hole diffusion length (∼150 nm) compared with α-Fe2O3 (2–4 nm) and TiO2 (104 nm) and inherently good electron transport properties. In recent years, to improve the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of WO3 photoanodes, much effort has focused on the exploitation of nanostructure-based WO3, such as nanowires, nanotubes, nanobelts and nanoplatelets. Nanostructure-based WO3 photoanodes have a high interfacial contact area compared with bulk WO3 that can increase the density of redox-active sites and enhance light harvesting and charge-separation efficiency. The splitting of water into H2 and O2 is an uphill reaction; a potential more negative than 0 V (vs. NHE at pH = 0) is needed to reduce water and a potential more positive than 1.23 V (vs. NHE at pH = 0) is needed to oxidize water (eqn (1) and (2)). A standard Gibbs free energy change ΔG° of 237 kJ mol−1 or 1.23 eV is needed theoretically to drive the overall water-splitting reaction (eqn (3)). The valence band edge of WO3 is located at approximately 3 eV (vs. NHE) and is positive enough for the oxidation of water. However, the energy level of its conduction band is not negative enough for the reduction of water. For a dual photoelectrode system with WO3 as a photoanode, the conduction band of the p-type material must be more negative than the reduction potential of water. In a photoelectrochemical device using WO3 as a photoanode, Pt is often chosen as the cathode (Fig. 1). Upon sufficient solar illumination, the electrons in the valence band of WO3 are promoted to the conduction band and transferred to the cathode (Pt) with the help of an external bias. The electrons collected at the cathode will be utilized to reduce water for hydrogen production. At the same time, water oxidation will take place at the WO3 photoanode as holes in the valence band are transferred to the electrolyte. The fabrication, morphology and photocatalytic performance of WO3 were generalized in Table 1.  2H2O + 4h+ → 4H+ + O2 (g), Eoox = 1.23 V (vs. NHE)(1) 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2 (g), Eored = 0 V (vs. NHE)(2) H2O → H2 + 1/2O2, ΔG° = 237 kJ mol−1 (1.23 V at pH = 0)(3)

4. Bare WO3 photoanodes
Efforts to use WO3 as a photoanode in a photoelectrochemical cell date back to 1976. Hodes, Cahen and Manassen first demonstrated the possibility of water splitting using WO3 as a photoanode (Pt as the counter electrode, SCE as the reference electrode) in 1 N H2SO4 under illumination (∼100 mW cm−2).105 For WO3 on a tungsten substrate, the onset potential was approximately 0.6 V (vs. NHE), and the photocurrent density reached approximately 0.2 mA cm−2. Many papers describing the preparation and limiting factors of photocatalytic water splitting with WO3 photoanodes have been published since the topic was first explored. The common synthetic methods for a nanostructure-based WO3 film for use as a photoanode for water splitting are sol–gel,106–116,144 hydrothermal,117–125,143 anodization,126–130 sputtering,131,132 chemical vapor deposition (CVD),133,134 spray pyrolysis deposition,135 atomic layer deposition154 and electrodeposition.155–157 The common factors limiting the solar-energy conversion efficiency for water splitting using nanostructured WO3 photoanodes include the following: fabrication methods of the photoanodes, morphology of the nanostructured films, dimension of the nanostructures, crystallinity, separation, transport and recombination of the photogenerated charges and the defect state of the nanocrystalline WO3.

4.1 Sol–gel methods
The sol–gel route is the most common method for preparing WO3 films. The W precursors were primarily prepared in the following two ways: (1) H2WO4 was obtained by the acidification of Na2WO4 solutions using a proton exchange resin. (2) Peroxopolytungstic acids (PPTA) was synthesized via the reaction of tungsten metal with hydrogen peroxide.
Wang et al. prepared a nanostructured WO3 film using the sol–gel process (1) with the addition of carbowax and triton as the surfactants.106 The photocurrent onset potential is approximately 0.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). A saturated photocurrent was reached at approximately 0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The photocurrent densities increased with increasing light intensity and temperature, and exhibited a linear relationship with the light intensity in the saturation regime.
Santato, Ulmann and Augustynski also prepared preferentially orientated WO3 films using the sol–gel process with poly(ethylene glycol) 300 (PEG 300) as a stabilizing regent.107–109 The size of the nanoparticles and the porosity of the films can be controlled by altering the annealing conditions and the ratio of tungsten acid to PEG 300. The sample without PEG 300 exhibited a morphology of irregular plate-like particles with substantial porosity of 200–400 nm after annealing at 500 °C. The sample with PEG 300 had a morphology of plate-like particles of 10–30 nm at the same annealing temperature. The maximum IPCE for a 2 μm-thick WO3 film photoanode was approximately 75% in a 1 M HClO4 solution without CH3OH at 1 V (vs. RHE) under illumination (100 mW cm−2). The saturation photocurrent density reached 2.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. RHE). Both the size and crystallinity of the WO3 nanocrystals increased with increasing annealing temperature (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  SEM of WO3 films prepared by the deposition of a tungsten acid/PEG 300 colloidal solution with annealing at 450 °C (left), at 500 °C (middle) and at 550 °C (right) for 30 min. This graphic was adapted from ref. 109. 
Yang et al. prepared mesoporous WO3 films using the sol–gel process (2)110–112 and created a comparison between the photocatalytic performance of the semi-transparent films and that of the transparent films. SEM images of the semi-transparent film indicated a network structure consisting of interconnected droplet-like nanoparticles with diameters of 100–300 nm. The average pore size and crystalline diameter were 12.5 nm and 17 nm, respectively. The transparent film exhibited smooth surfaces with occasional cracks, and its average pore diameter and crystallite size were 7.3 nm and 30 nm, respectively. The maximum photocurrent density of a 2.3 μm-thick semi-transparent WO3 film was approximately 2.2 mA cm−2 in a 1 M H2SO4 solution under light irradiation (100 mW cm−2).111 The IPCE of the semi-transparent WO3 film at 410 nm was approximately 40% in a 1.0 M H2SO4 solution at 1.0 V (vs. SCE).
Yagi et al. prepared a nanostructured platelet-like WO3 film using a simpler procedure,113 in which the precursor was obtained from a mixture of tungsten acid (0.25 g) and a 30% aqueous ammonia solution (0.6 mL) followed by the addition of ethanol (1.0 mL) and PEG (0.78 g). The resulting mixture was coated onto an ITO substrate using a doctor-blade technique, and the system was calcinated at 300–550 °C for 90 min. The flat-band potential was approximately 0.30 V (vs. SCE) based on the Mott–Schottky analysis. The donor carrier density was ND = 2.5 × 1022 cm−3. The photocurrent density of the WO3 film annealed at 550 °C was approximately 3.7 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V (vs. SCE) under illumination. The maximum IPCE was approximately 47% at 320 nm.
Meda et al. studied the relationship between the particle size and the molecular weight of the organic dispersing agents:114 smaller sized particles could be obtained by increasing the molecular weight of the organic dispersing agents. They prepared a 200 nm-thick WO3 film with a particle diameter of 40 nm using PEG-BAE (Mw ∼20000) as an organic dispersing agent. The photocurrent density was approximately 1.6 mA cm−2 at 1.4 V (vs. SCE) in 1 M H2SO4 under 140 W cm−2. A film sample of similar particle size and thickness was fabricated using PEG 6000 as an organic dispersing agent, and the photocurrent density decreased to 0.48 mA cm−2. The photocurrent onset potential and flat-band potential were approximately 0.3 V and 0.25 V (vs. SCE) for the two samples, respectively.
A highly transparent sphere-like WO3 nanoparticle film was prepared by controlling the weight ratio of the tungsten precursor to PEG.115 The optimized photocurrent density of the film reached approximately 3.7 mA cm−2 at 1.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). A tandem cell was fabricated by connecting a bipolar WO3/Pt electrode with a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The maximum photocurrent density of the tandem cell for water splitting was more than 2.4 mA cm−2 at 0.4 V (vs. Pt) under illumination (100 mW cm−2) without applied bias potentials. The photocurrent onset potential was approximately −0.2 V (vs. Pt) that was negatively shifted by 0.6 V corresponding to that of WO3 photoelectrode prepared at the same conditions.
Hsiao et al. investigated ways to remove structural defects to improve photocatalytic performance by treating the WO3 photoanodes with solvent vapor.116 They treated the annealed samples in a Teflon-lined autoclave containing a solvent of methanol, ethanol, hexane or water at 140 °C for 18 h. For a methanol vapor-treated WO3 nanocrystalline film, the maximum solar energy conversion efficiency was approximately 0.54% at 0.9 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a 1 M HClO4 solution under illumination (100 mW cm−2), a 32% improvement as compared with the non-treated film. The photocurrent onset potential was approximately 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) indicated a mesoscopic structure. The oxidation state of the tungsten and the optical properties of the WO3 nanocrystalline films were little affected following methanol vapor treatment. For methanol vapor-treated WO3 films, the electron transit rate was 25% greater than that of the non-treated WO3 films due to the increase in the tungsten coordination numbers of the nanocrystalline films that accompanied the decreasing defect state.
4.2 Hydrothermal methods
Hong et al. synthesized WO3 nanocrystals using a hydrothermal process with ammonium metatungstate [(NH4)6H2W12O40·xH2O] as a precursor, followed by calcination at 500–800 °C and compared the photocatalytic performance of these nanoparticles in suspension and photoanode films.117 The photocurrent onset potential appeared at approximately 0.45 V (vs. NHE). The maximum photocurrent was approximately 0.6 mA cm−2 for photoanode films obtained from samples calcined at 600 °C; however, the maximum rate of O2 evolution for the nanoparticles in suspension was obtained in the samples calcined at 800 °C. This observation was attributed to difference in the charge separation mechanisms between the nanoparticle suspensions and the WO3 films.
Li et al. synthesized nanocrystalline WO3 films using a hydrothermal method with ammonium metatungstate [(NH4)6W7O24·6H2O] as a precursor and PEG 1000 as a surfactant.118 The thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) showed a continuous, slow weight loss until 220 °C, followed by a rapid weight loss between 220 and 275 °C, in which the slow weight loss was attributed to the loss of adsorbed water and water bonding, and the rapid weight loss was caused by the decomposition of ammonium metatungstate. The sharp endothermic peak at 400 °C was attributed to the crystallization of WO3. XRD spectra indicated a distorted cubic phase of the WO3 film for samples annealed at 400–550 °C in air for 3 h corresponding to the peaks (2θ = 23.4, 34.0, 42.1, 49.0, and 55.3°). The crystallite sizes of the WO3 were 25, 38, 40 and 49 nm corresponding to calcination temperatures of 400, 450, 500 and 550 °C, respectively. Tauc plots of the WO3 films indicated that the band gaps decreased from 3.16 to 2.93 eV as the temperature increased from 400 to 550 °C. SEM images showed a smooth, uniform-sized 2.9 μm WO3 film with 60 nm nanocrystals for samples calcined at 450 °C. The optimized photocurrent density for the WO3 films calcined at 450 °C was approximately 2.7 mA cm−2 at 1.4 V (vs. RHE) in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution under illumination (100 mW cm−2). Mott–Schottky plots of samples calcined at varying temperatures indicated that the films calcined at 450 °C had the highest donor carrier density (for an n-type semiconductor) ND (2.44 × 1022 cm−3) measured at an AC frequency of 1 kHz in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution.
Amano et al. studied the effect of grain boundaries on photoelectrochemical performance by comparing crystalline flakes that were vertically arrayed on the substrate (flake-wall films) with horizontally laminated flakes (flake-laminate films).119 The flake-wall films were prepared using a solvothermal method with Tungsten(VI) chloride (WCl6) as a precursor. The photocurrent density of a flake-wall-WO3-film photoanode was approximately 2.0 mA cm−2, a value considerably higher than that of the flake-laminate WO3 photoanode (0.5 mA cm−2), in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution under visible light irradiation. They attributed this difference to the variation in the grain boundaries of two films. The grain boundaries can affect the photoelectrochemical performance by rewarding the electron transport and reducing the lifetime of the photoexcited carriers.
Amano et al. compared the photocatalytic performance of films composed of perpendicularly oriented crystalline flakes and nanocrystalline WO3 film.120,121 The photocurrent density of flake film was 8 times greater than that of the nanocrystalline WO3 film in a 0.1 M NaSO4 solution under chopped visible light. The IPCE of the flake film was 2 times greater than that of the nanocrystalline WO3 film under monochromatic 400 nm irradiation at 1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl).
Amano et al. also investigated the effect of the hydrothermal reaction temperature and time on photoelectrochemical performance.122 Platelike WO3 films were obtained by heating tungsten sheets in a dilute nitric acid solution at 100–180 °C with subsequent calcination at 450 °C. The optimized thickness of the film was approximately 1.6 μm with a compact layer under the plate-like structures, which was obtained via hydrothermal reaction for 1 h at 180 °C. The photocurrent onset potential was approximately 0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The IPCE was up to 66.2%. The photocurrent density reached approximately 4 mA cm−2 in a 0.1 M H2SO4 solution at 1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under photoirradiation. However, the photocurrent density will be significantly diminished if the reaction times are extended beyond the optimum time; prolonged reaction times at a higher temperature resulted in a rapid increase in the thickness of the compact layer, which impeded the electron transport.
Films of crystalline WO3 nanosheets oriented perpendicular to tungsten substrates were prepared by Qin, Yang, Grimes et al. using a surfactant-free hydrothermal growth method,123 followed by calcination at 500 or 700 °C. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) data indicated that the lateral particle dimensions of the sheets remained at 1–2 μm and the blocky aggregate films increased to 4 μm after extending the reaction time from 2 h to 17 h, while the thickness of the flakes increased to 100–200 nm. For the samples annealed at 500 °C for 17 h, the saturation photocurrent density was approximately 1.2 mA cm−2 at 0.55 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution under 100 mW cm−2. For the samples annealed at 700 °C for 17 h, the maximum photocurrent density was approximately 2.3 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The onset potential was approximately 0.05 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). A 2.65 eV optical band gap was obtained from a plot of the square root of the Kubelka–Munk function, F(R), versus the photon energy for a sample annealed for 17 h at 700 °C. The maximum IPCE was approximately 40% at 400 nm for samples annealed at 500 and 700 °C for 17 h.
The platelike, wedgelike, and sheetlike nanostructured WO3 films on FTO glasses could be selectively prepared by a crystal-seed-assisted hydrothermal method using Na2WO4·2H2O as a tungsten source and Na2SO4, (NH4)2SO4, and CH3COONH4 as capping agents followed by calcination in air at 500 °C for 30 min.124 The morphology could be controlled by altering the crystal seeds layers. With CH3COONH4 as a capping agent, the highest photocurrent density was approximately 0.5 mA cm−2 at 1.45 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a 1 M H2SO4 solution under illumination (100 mW cm−2). The highest efficiency for the photoconversion of light energy to chemical energy for water splitting was approximately 0.3% at 0.65 V (vs. Ag/AgCl).
Su et al. synthesized WO3 vertically aligned nanowire arrays from substrates via a solvothermal technique.125 First, a seed layer of 200 nm thickness was deposited on a FTO-coated glass via a sol–gel method using 1.25 g H2WO4 with a mixture of 0.5 g poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and 10 mL H2O2 (50 wt%), followed by annealing at 500 °C for 2 h. Second, nanowire array growth was carried out using a solvothermal technique: a mixture of 0.05 M H2WO4 (3 mL), 6 M HCl (0.5 mL), 2.5 mL deionized water and 10 mL CH3CN was placed in a 23 mL autoclave containing a WO3 seed layer, sealed and maintained at 180 °C for 6 h. Two types of nanoflake films were formed by modification of the nanowire array solvothermal conditions. The first type (NF1) was obtained by the reaction of a mixture of 0.05 M H2WO4 (3 mL), 0.02 g oxalic acid, 0.02 g urea, 6 M HCl (0.5 mL) and 12.5 mL acetonitrile at 180 °C for 2 h, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 1 h. The second type (NF2) was obtained using a mixture of 0.25 M H2WO4 (3 mL), 0.2 g oxalic acid, 6 M HCl (0.5 mL), 2.5 mL deionized water and 10 mL acetonitrile. FESEM images (Fig. 3) indicated that the nanowire length was ∼500–1500 nm, and the thickness of the NF1 and NF2 was approximately 20–30 nm. The heights of the NF1 and NF2 were approximately 1–2 μm and 5–6 μm, respectively. The XRD patterns indicated hexagonal and monoclinic structures for the nanowire and nanoflake films, both unannealed and annealed, respectively. The TEM images of the annealed nanowire and nanoflakes indicated that the growth direction of the hexagonal nanowires was along [001], and that of the monoclinic nanoflakes was along [020] and [200]. NF2 films yield the highest saturation photocurrent value at approximately 1.4 mA cm−2 under illumination (>400 nm, 100 mW cm−2). The photocurrent density for the NF1 films was approximately 3 times that of the nanowire array films with a thickness comparable to the NF1 films. The NF2 films displayed the highest IPCE of 60% below 400 nm at 0.5 V. The onset wavelengths of the photocurrents for the nanowire, the NF1 and NF2 films were 430, 468, and 480 nm, respectively. The electron transport times calculated for the nanowires, the NF1, and NF2 films are 2.89, 3.35, and 26.99 ms, respectively. IMPS was employed to investigate electron transport.

4.3 Anodization methods
A WO3 porous nanostructure was grown on Ti foil using an anodization technique with a mixture of 22.5 ml H2O, 1.8 g NH4F+ and 427.5 ml ethylene glycol as the electrolytes at 35 V for 1or 2 h, followed by annealing for 30 min at 350 °C and 500 °C, respectively.126 SEM images indicated that nanoporous sponge-like morphologies were formed with a diameter of 20–50 nm or 60 nm for 1 h and 2 h anodization, respectively. The thickness of the porous nanostructures of the WO3 layers approached 187 nm and 400 nm. The W layers, which were located between Ti substrate and WO3 layers, were approximately 200 nm and 1.08 μm, respectively, The surface corrosion of the porous nanostructures of WO3 in alkaline electrolytes was drastically reduced by coating the WO3 surface with an ITO film (100 nm) using a DC magnetron sputtering technique at 300 °C, and the photocurrent density of the ITO-coated samples increased to 2.08 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under 30 mW cm−2. However, under the same conditions, the photocurrent density was approximately 0.61 mA cm−2 for samples without the ITO-coating.
The wormlike WO3 photoanodes were grown using potentiostatic anodization with tungsten foils and water as precursors in high-dielectric-constant organic solvents, such as N-methyl-formamide (NMF), formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N,N-dimethyl-formamide (DMF).127 The potentiostatic anodization was carried out by quickly increasing the voltage to 40 V at a rate of 0.5 V s−1. Mixtures of NMF–H2O (8:2) and 0.05% NH4F were the optimal electrolytes. The highest photocurrent density obtained was approximately 3.5 mA cm−2 at 1.5 V (vs. SCE) in a 1 M H2SO4 solution under an incident power of 150 mW cm−2 and was more than 9 mA cm−2 under incident power of 370 mW cm−2. The photocurrent onset potential was approximately 0.3 V (vs. SCE). However, at low power intensities (≤100 mW cm−2), the photocurrent densities were quite similar to those of a more conventional WO3 electrode obtained by standard sol–gel methods (colloidal). The hydrogen production rate reached 2 ml cm−2 h−1 at the cathode in a 1 M H2SO4 solution. The IPCE ranged up to approximately 70% in a broad UV region and 45% at 400 nm and 1.5 V (vs. SCE). The optical band onset was approximately 480 nm corresponding to an indirect band gap of 2.66 eV.
To study the effect of anodization conditions on the photoelectrochemical response of WO3 films, Tacconi et al. prepared WO3 films by anodization of tungsten foils using various electrolyte media in a two-electrode electrochemical cell.128 The anodization voltages were controlled in the range of 10 to 60 V. SEM images indicated that a WO3 film with a nanobowl morphology, with pore diameters of 44–85 nm and a photocurrent density of approximately 2.9 mA cm−2, was formed by the anodization of tungsten foils in 0.3 M oxalic acid at constant voltage (35 V) for 1 h. The WO3 film grown from glycerol–H2O (25:75) in 0.3 M oxalic acid at 35 V for 1 h had the highest photocurrent density of 2.8 mA cm−2. The photocurrent density of the best WO3 film anodized in 0.15 M NaF at 60 V for 3 h reached 3.52 mA cm−2, and the maximum IPCE of the nanoporous film was up to 180% in a 0.5 M Na2SO4+0.1 M HCOONa solution at 2.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl).
Berger et al. prepared a WO3 film with a porous structure by the anodization of tungsten foils at 40 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 1 M H2SO4 + 0.5 wt% NaF for 1 h.129 SEM images indicated that a uniform porous layer was formed with a pore diameter of approximately 70 nm, pore spacing of 80 nm and a pore wall thickness of approximately 10–15 nm. After annealing at 500 °C, the as-anodized amorphous WO3 was transformed into crystalline monoclinic WO3. For comparison with the amorphous WO3, approximately 90 nm compact WO3 layers were prepared on W in a 1 M H2SO4 fluoride-free solution at 40 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The photoelectrochemical studies indicated that films of both amorphous and compact layer structures resulted in a significantly enhanced photoresponse after the annealing process. The photocurrent efficiency of the amorphous WO3 films was much more greater than that of the compact layer films within comparable wavelengths.
Li et al. prepared nanoporous WO3 films by anodization using tungsten foils in 1 M Na2SO4 with 0.5 wt% NaF for 30 min followed annealing at 450 °C for 3 h.130 The compact WO3 films for use as a reference were obtained by anodization in 1 M Na2SO4 without F−. SEM images indicated that nanoporous WO3 films with a pore diameter of 70–90 nm were formed at 50 V in 1 M Na2SO4 with 0.5 wt% NaF. XPS analysis confirmed the formation of WO3 layer by peaks W4f7/2, Wf5/2 and O1s with binding energies of 35.7, 37.8 eV and 530.9 eV, respectively. XRD patterns displayed the characteristics of monoclinic WO3 with three peaks (2θ ≈ 23°) that were attributed to the (002), (020) and (200) lattice planes of WO3. The photocurrent densities of the nanoporous and compact WO3 films were approximately 3.45 mA cm−2 and 0.73 mA cm−2, respectively, at 1.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution (pH = 0) under illumination (100 mW cm−2). The maximum conversions of light energy to chemical energy for the annealed nanoporous and compact WO3 films were approximately 0.91% and 0.20%, respectively. The maximum IPCE values for the annealed nanoporous and compact WO3 films were approximately 92% and 19%, respectively, obtained at a wavelength of 340 nm at 1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The annealed nanoporous WO3 film demonstrated the smallest arc radius in the EIS Nyquist plot, indicating that it possessed the highest efficiency of charge separation and conductivities.
4.4 Sputtering techniques
Marsen et al. reported the preparation of the WO3 films with thicknesses of 1.2–1.6 μm by reactive RF magnetron sputtering from a metallic W target, in which the sputtering was carried out in an argon/oxygen (or nitrogen for N-doped films) atmosphere with the desired percentage of oxygen or nitrogen at low processing temperatures (100–250 °C).131 The film deposition rate, thickness, grain size, crystallinity and nanostructure morphology can be precisely controlled by adjusting the parameters (applied sputtering power, temperature, gas percentage, time and pressure). Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in 0.33 M H3PO4 (Pt as a counter electrode, saturated calomel electrode as a reference), XRD data indicated that the photocurrent performance depended on the crystallite size. For a sample with a Scherrer grain size of 27 and 49 nm in the (002) and (200) planes, the highest photocurrent density for the WO3 film was approximately 2.7 mA cm−2 at 1.6 V (vs. SCE) under simulated AM 1.5 global illumination. Using the same sputter target, they prepared another sample with a Scherrer grain size of 13 and 35 nm in the (002) and (200) planes, and its photocurrent density was approximately 1.5 mA cm−2 under the same conditions. The maximum photocurrent density of a nitrogen-doped sample at low dopant concentration was approximately 2.3 mA cm−2 at 1.6 V (vs. SCE).
Zheng et al. prepared the tungsten thin films on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates using a radio-frequency sputtering technique.132 The anodization of the films was carried out in a 0.5 wt% NH4F–ethylene glycol solution by supplying voltages of 20 V, 40 V and 60 V. The SEM images indicated that uniformly-distributed nanopores (60–100 nm) were formed by supplying a voltage of 60 V for 1 h. The XRD data indicated that the W films were fully not oxidized into WO3. The crystal structure of orthorhombic WO3 was clearly observed after calcination at 450 °C. For the annealed nanoporous WO3 film, a photocurrent density of 27 μA cm−2 was obtained in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution without an external voltage. For the compact unannealed WO3 film, the photocurrent density was only 4.8 μA cm−2 under the same conditions.
4.5 Chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
Three-dimensional WO3 nanostructures were fabricated using a high-temperature reactive vapor deposition process on carbon paper in the presence of oxygen with tungsten powder as a precursor.133 The optical band gap of the 3D WO3 nanostructures was approximately 2.36 eV. The maximum photocurrent density was approximately 0.45 mA cm−2 at 0.25 V (vs. SCE) in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution under visible light irradiation.
Chakrapani et al. fabricated WO3 nanowire arrays on FTO or tungsten substrates using chemical vapor deposition.134 The metal filament and substrate temperatures were set at approximately 1950 K and 773–823 K, respectively, and the partial pressure of oxygen in the chamber was maintained at 0.77 Torr. The resulting oxygen-deficient phase, W18O49, was transformed to completely oxidized WO3 at 823 K over 2 h. W2N nanowire arrays were prepared by complete nitridation of WO3 nanowire arrays using 50 sccm ammonia at 250 mTorr. SEM images indicated that the length and diameters of the highly oriented vertical WO3 nanowires grown on FTO were in the range of 2–3 μm and 40–70 nm, respectively. The width and length of the WO3 samples grown on tungsten substrates were in the range of 400–500 nm and 80–100 nm, respectively. XRD patterns indicated that primary WO3 nanowire arrays were transformed to W2N arrays following the nitridation process, which corresponds to a transformation from the monoclinic phase of WO3 arrays ([001] orientation) to the cubic structure of β-W2N phase ([200] orientation). The grain size of the W2N was estimated by the Scherrer equation to be 3.95 nm. Peaks were detected in the Raman spectra of W2N nanowires at approximately 208, 690, and 799 cm−1. The band gaps for bare WO3 and slightly oxidized W2N over 8 min were approximately 2.9 and 2.2 eV based on the Tauc plots. Electrochemical impedance measurements of illuminated WO3 and W2N nanowire array were carried out in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at 1 kHz. The Mott–Schottky plots of WO3 and W2N at 1 kHz exhibited a positive slope indicating that both WO3 and W2N were n-type semiconductors. The flat band potentials (VFB) of WO3 and W2N, which can be obtained from intercept to the potential axis, were approximately 0.3 V and 0.45 V (vs. SCE). The work function for both electrodes were approximately 4.98 and 5.13 eV, as estimated using the VFB values. No dark current was observed below 1.7 V for WO3/FTO. The dark current can be observed across the entire positive potential range for W2N on both W and quartz substrates. The photocurrent density of the W2N nanowire arrays was approximately 1.5 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V (vs. SCE) in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution under illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The highest efficiencies for WO3 and W2N were approximately 0.33% and 0.4%, corresponding to applied biases of 0.82 V and 0.84 V (vs. SCE), respectively. The maximum IPCE for the WO3 nanowire arrays was approximately 85% at 1.2 V (vs. SCE) at a wavelength of 370 nm. Hydrogen evolution at the W2N and WO3 electrodes during cathodic polarization was observed with significant cathodic current at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1 in darkness. The rate of hydrogen evolution for W2N (W and quartz substrates) was much greater than that for WO3 on FTO. Both the photocurrent and photoresponse of the W2N electrodes degraded with increasing irradiation time. However, the mixed phases of W2N–WO3 displayed greater stability against photocorrosion than pure W2N.
5. Doped-WO3
Anion doping can enhance the visible light response of WO3via band-edge modifications. The band gap can be reduced by shifting the valence band edge upward due to a mixing of the p states of the doped anion with the O2p states. Cation doping can create impurity energy levels within the visible range by replacing cations in the crystal lattice of WO3.
Sun et al. prepared C-doped WO3 films using glucose as the carbon dopant source from aqueous acetylated peroxotungstic acid using a spray pyrolysis method.135 The XRD patterns indicated that the annealed C-doped WO3 films had a monoclinic structure (2θ = 24.4°) corresponding to the (200) plane. The particle size increased with increasing glucose concentration and decreased with increasing calcination temperatures. The band gap energies of the undoped and C-doped WO3 ([glucose] = 0.07 M) were approximately 2.62 and 2.57 eV, respectively, based on the transformed diffuse reflectance spectra. SEM images indicated a film thickness of approximately 50 μm after spraying for 25 min. The XPS spectra of the C-doped WO3 exhibited a C1s peak at 289.9 eV attributed to a carbonate species, which was consistent with the peak at 161 ppm (assigned to CO) in the 13C NMR spectrum of the C-doped WO3. The binding energies of the W4f7/2 and W4f5/2 peaks for the C-doped WO3 were approximately 35.8 and 38.0 eV, respectively. No obvious shifts in the binding energy, compared with the values for the undoped WO3 of 35.7 and 37.8 eV, indicated that the C doping occurred at interstitial sites. The photocurrent densities were strongly dependent on the glucose concentration, the calcination temperature and the film thickness. An optimized C-doped WO3 film was obtained using a glucose concentration of 0.07 M, a calcination temperature of 600 °C and a thickness of 50 μm. The photocurrent densities of the C-doped and undoped WO3 were approximately 1.6 and 1.1 mA cm−2, respectively, at 1.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a 1 M HCl solution under illumination (130 mW cm−2).
Nah et al. prepared the nitrogen doped porous WO3 layers using a thermal treatment in NH3.136 The SEM images indicated that a highly ordered porous layer with a pore size of 70 nm and a pore wall thickness of 15 nm was created through the anodization procedure, followed by calcination at 450 °C. The morphology can be maintained up to 300 °C. When treated with NH3 gas, changes to the morphology occurred at 400 °C, and a completely different morphology consisting of massive particles was obtained at 600 °C. Higher photocurrent densities were generated in the visible range with NH3 treatment at 300 °C, and the photocurrent densities significantly decreased with NH3 treatment at 600 °C. XRD patterns both before and after NH3 treatment of the WO3 indicated that a monoclinic WO3 phase was almost entirely transformed into a W2N phase with the NH3 treatment at 600 °C, and crystallinity in the WO3 layer was nearly lost. For samples treated with NH3 at 300 °C, the monoclinic phase of WO3 remained, and the intensity of the (020) planes increased significantly. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the WO3 layers treated with NH3 at 300 °C confirmed doping of nitrogen in the WO3 lattice with a N 1 s peak at 397 eV (N–W).
Nitrogen-doped WO3 films were also fabricated using reactive RF magnetron sputtering with N2 pressures in the range of 0–6 mTorr,137 and a partial pressure of oxygen set to 1.4 mTorr. For higher concentrations of nitrogen doping (>3 mTorr), a significant band gap reduction was realized; the band gap can be reduced to less than 2.0 eV. However, photocurrent densities decreased with increasing N-doping concentrations; the photocurrent density was reduced to 0.67 mA cm−2 with N-doping at 6 mTorr, which was a significant reduction compared with that of bare WO3 (2.68 mA cm−2).
Yang and Luca prepared a 0.25 atom% tellurium-doped WO3 film with a thickness of 5 μm using a simple sol–gel route with peroxopolytungstic acid (PPTA) as a precursor.138 An undoped WO3 film of the same thickness was fabricated as a reference. The Te-doped WO3 film exhibited a significant response to red light with a transient spike followed by a quasi-steady-state photocurrent in the potential range between 0.15 and 0.7 V. The film also exhibited a maximum photocurrent density of 0.4 mA cm−2 in a 1 M H2SO4 solution under white light. The undoped WO3 displayed a stationary photocurrent under white light and exhibited no photoresponse to red light. The Te-doped WO3 film had a higher IPCE with 40 Hz chopped illumination than with 160 Hz at 0.4 V bias. The photoresponse of the Te-doped WO3 film extended from 300 to 800 nm at a 0.4 V bias. However, the photoresponse of the undoped WO3 disappeared at wavelengths exceeding 460 nm. The IPCE of the Te-doped WO3 film was considerably higher than that of the undoped-WO3 film under the same conditions. The IPEC curve of the Te-doped WO3 film disappeared at bias potentials exceeding 1 V, which was good agreement with the photocurrent density measurements, in which the transient spikes appeared only at bias potentials below 0.7 eV. The Te-doped and undoped WO3 films had similar bandgaps with a value of 2.6 eV determined using a Tauc plot. The intensity of the absorption edge of the Te-doped film was enhanced up to 40% compared with that of the undoped WO3 film.
Yourey and Bartlett reported the synthesis of CuWO4 by electrochemical deposition.139 After annealing at 500 °C in air for 2 h, the electrodeposited CuWO4 films exhibited n-type conductivity, an indirect band gap of 2.25 eV and a donor density of 2.7 × 1021 cm−3. A photocurrent density of 0.16 μA cm−2 was obtained at 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a potassium phosphate buffer (pH = 7). The electrodeposited CuWO4 films were more stable in both dark and illuminated conditions than polycrystalline WO3.
Chang et al. synthesized 2 μm-thick CuWO4 thin films using a reactive cosputtering method with metallic Cu and W targets at 275 °C.140 The SEM images (Fig. 4) indicated that the CuWO4 thin films consisted of globular grains with diameters of 50–100 nm. After annealing at 500 °C for 8 h in argon, the edges of the grains became sharper, and the surface of films became rather rough. XRD patterns confirmed a structural transformation from amorphous CuWO4 to triclinic. The optical band (Eg ≈ 2.25 eV) of CuWO4 was better adapted for photoelectrochemical water splitting than WO3 (Eg ≈ 2.6 eV) in terms of the energy level of VB and CB. EIS measurements of the as-deposited and annealed CuWO4 films were conducted in a 0.33 M H3PO4 solution at 0.5 V (vs. SCE) under AM 1.5 G illumination. Nyquist plots indicated distinct electrochemical behavior for the as-deposited (amorphous) and annealed (polycrystalline) films. For the as-deposited films, the charge transfer resistance was estimated from the impedance spectra to be greater than 10000 Ω cm2, and that for the annealed film was approximately 2200 Ω cm2. Both, however, were larger than the charge transfer resistance of the reactively sputtered polycrystalline WO3 (200 Ω cm2). Analysis of the Mott–Schottky plots indicated that the as-deposited and annealed CuWO4 were p-type and n-type semiconductors with flat potentials of 0.54 V and −0.35 V, respectively. The charge carrier density, ND, of the annealed and as-deposited CuWO4 films were calculated to be approximately 4.68 × 1019 cm−3 and 6.0 × 1014 cm−3, respectively. The photocurrent density of the annealed CuWO4 film was approximately 0.4 mA cm−2 in 0.33 M H3PO4 at 1.6 V (vs. SCE) under AM 1.5 G illumination.

Pesci et al. investigated the lifetime required of holes for water oxidation on the WO3 by transient absorption spectroscopy.141 The photogenerated hole in the WO3 valence band will transfer to the WO3/electrolyte interface to oxidize water. The process is the rate-limiting step in the photochemical oxidation of water and is quite slow. Long-lived holes are required for water oxidation on WO3. The presence of Ag+ as a hole scavenger in the electrolyte can enhance the rate of hole transfer from WO3 to the electrolyte so that holes present over the millisecond-second time scale can effectively oxidize water. The deposition of silver nanoparticles on the WO3 surface can also create a potential catalytic site.
Lee et al. prepared a scaled-up WO3 photoanode on an Ag grid embedded with FTO substrates using a screen-printing method for studying photoelectrochemical water splitting.142 An Ag grid was utilized to efficiently overcome the internal resistance in the FTO substrates. The XRD patterns indicated a polycrystalline nature with (002), (020), (200) and (022), (−202), (202) reflections. The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a conventional three-electrode system combined with a dye-sensitized solar cell to supply bias power. The dark current of the O2 evolution can be observed in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution up to 1.5 V (vs. SCE). For a 5 μm-thick WO3 photoanode with a 0.6 × 0.6 cm2 active area, the onset potential was approximately 0.35 V (vs. SCE). The saturation photocurrent density was approximately 2.28 mA cm−2 at 1.4 V (vs. SCE) under illumination (100 mW cm−2). For a 5 μm-thick WO3 photoanode with a 0.6 × 8 cm2 active area and an Ag grid embedded in the substrates, the photocurrent density was approximately 1.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. SCE). Without the Ag grid, this photoanode's photocurrent density was approximately 0.64 mA cm−2. The photocurrent densities were 2.63 mA cm−2, 1.5 mA cm−2 and 1.18 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) corresponding to WO3 photoanode active areas of 0.36 cm2, 4.8 cm2 and 130.56 cm2. Solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies under illumination (100 mW cm−2) were approximately 3.24% and 2% at 1.23 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for a WO3 photoanode with active area of 0.36 cm2 and 4.8 cm2. The rate of hydrogen generation was 3 mL min−1 for a photoanode with a 130.56 cm2 active area.
Miseki et al. reported the Cs-modification effects of WO3 on photocatalytic O2 evolution under irradiation with visible light.143 They treated the WO3 powder with a hydrothermal (HT) method using an aqueous Cs2CO3 solution and an impregnation (IMP) method in an Fe2(SO4)3 solution. Analysis of the SEM, XRD and UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra data indicated that the morphology of the WO3 was not altered by the modification with Cs+ in the HT procedure. The photocatalytic O2 evolution of commercial WO3 was approximately 18 μmol h−1 under illumination (λ > 420 nm). After the WO3 was calcined at 973 K and treated with the hydrothermal (HT) method at 393 K in H2O, the photocatalytic O2 evolution increased to 63 μmol h−1 and further increased to 92 μmol h−1 after the surface of WO3 was modified with Cs+ by the hydrothermal (HT) method in an aqueous Cs2CO3 solution. The O2 evolution during first and second runs reached approximately 117 μmol h−1 and 196 μmol h−1, respectively, for the Cs-modified WO3 that was prepared using the IMP method. The maximum quantity of O2 gas was approximately 315 μmol over Cs-modified WO3 with a stoichiometric quantity of Fe3+ (1260 μmol) in the solution.
Solarska et al. investigated the effect of plasmon-active silver NPs on the performance of a mesoporous WO3 photoanode for photocatalytic water splitting by sputtering silver NPs onto the WO3 film (referred as to Ag-WO3).144 They prepared WO3 films using a sol–gel method with a tungsten acid as the precursor, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min. Then, silver layers were sputtered onto the WO3 films using the Ag target metal. The optimized Ag-WO3 photoanode (4 nm-thick silver NP layer on a 1 μm-thick WO3 film) exhibited a photocurrent density plateau of 2.1 mA cm−2 at 0.25 V (vs. mercurous sulfate/mercury) in a 1 M H2SO4 solution under AM 1.5 solar illumination from the back side. The photocurrent of a bare WO3 photoanode was approximately 60% of that of the Ag-WO3. The photocurrent onset potential of the Ag-WO3 had a 50 mV negative shift compared with that of bare WO3. The IPCE of the Ag-WO3 was enhanced by up to 50% at short wavelengths when irradiated from the backside compared bare WO3. The photocurrent enhancement was attributed to a combination of optical (nonresonant light scattering and light reflection) and plasmonic (resonant light scattering and electromagnetic field enhancement) effects.
Xie et al. reported a facile and new route of synthesizing a quasi-cubic-like and rectangular sheet-like WO3 crystal.145 The former had a deeper valence band edge and thus enhanced the rate of photocatalytic water splitting. In contrast, The later had a higher conduction band edge and thus increased the ability of photoreduction. As-prepared H0.23WO3 crystals have an overall cubic morphology with a nearly equal percentage of {002}, {200} and {020} facets. The quasi-cubic-like WO3 crystals had different facet edges and corners (Fig. 5). The oxygen evolution rate using the quasi-cubic-like WO3 crystals as a catalyst was approximately 5.9 μmol h−1, however, the rectangular sheet-like crystals as a catalyst evolved O2 only at the rate of 0.7 μmol h−1.

6. WO3 composites
The WO3 composites exhibit the combinations of properties of multiple components that are not available in single-component materials. The structure of multiple components has been shown to be rather effective in inhibiting charge recombination, enhancing photocatalytic performance in the visible light region and suppressing the photocorrosion of WO3 photoanodes. Fig. 6 shows a mechanism of the WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction composite electrode for water splitting.

Su et al. prepared a novel heterojunction planar and nanorod-array WO3/BiVO4 film for photo electrochemical water splitting.146 A mixture of H2WO4 (1.25 g), PVA (0.5 g) and 50 wt% H2O2 (10 mL) were repeatedly deposited onto FTO via spin coating. Each spin-coating step was followed by calcination at 500 °C for 2 h. The resulting 100 nm-thick WO3 layer was refluxed in a BiVO4 solution to form a planar WO3/BiVO4 film, which was then annealed at 400 °C for 2 h. To obtain a nanorod-array WO3/BiVO4 film, a 100 nm-thick WO3 seed layer was first deposited onto FTO via spin coating with the same solution used above, then annealed at 500 °C for 2 h. The WO3 seed layer was placed vertically in a 23 mL autoclave filled with a mixture of 0.05 M H2WO4 (3 mL), CH3CH2OH (9 mL), 6 M HCl (4 mL), oxalic acid (0.01 g) and urea (0.02 g). The autoclave was sealed and maintained at 180 °C for 24 h to form a nanorod WO3 layer. The BiVO4 was deposited onto the nanorod WO3 layer to form WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction films, which were then annealed at 400 °C for 24 h. The FE-SEM images indicated that the thicknesses of the planar WO3 and BiVO4 films produced by a single spin-coating step were approximately 700 nm and 70 nm, respectively. The length of the WO3 nanorod was 500–1000 nm, and the width was 60–300 nm (Fig. 7). XRD patterns indicated that the planar WO3 film had a monoclinic structure and the WO3 nanorod film had an hexagonal structure after annealing at 500 °C for 2 h. BiVO4 displayed a monoclinic structure. The photocurrent density of a 700 nm-thick WO3 layer was approximately 0.4 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V (vs. NHE) in a 0.5 M NaSO4 solution. The photocurrent onset potential was approximately 0.1 V (vs. NHE). The photocurrent density of a planar WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction film reached 0.8 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V (vs. NHE). The enhancement of photocurrent was attributed to improvements in the charge separation after the BiVO4 layer was deposited onto WO3 layer. The photocurrent density of the nanorod WO3/BiVO4 film was much higher than that of the planar WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction film and reached approximately 1.6 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V (vs. NHE). The enhancement of the photocurrent was attributed to the production and separation of additional carriers close to the WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction, which was caused by the vertical growth of the WO3 nanorod and the large surface area of the nanorod array. The nanostructure type facilitated the direct absorption of light and direct electron transfer to the conductive substrate, and it shortened the path for the holes to the aqueous electrolyte. The onset photocurrent wavelengths of the WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction and the WO3 layer were approximately 525 nm and 450 nm, respectively. The optimized thickness of the WO3 was approximately 400 nm. Although the photocurrent density was smaller than that of WO3/BiVO4 film, the IPCE of the WO3 film was higher than that of the WO3/BiVO4 film below a wavelength of 400 nm in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution at 0.5 V (vs. NHE). The photocurrent density under backside illumination in the planar WO3/BiVO4 film was approximately twice that under frontal illumination. The IPCE of the nanorod WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction film was approximately 30% at 400 nm in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution at 0.5 V (vs. NHE) and reached nearly 70% at 350 nm. The planar WO3/BiVO4 film was approximately 10% at 350 nm and 5% at 400 nm. The IMPS spectra of a 770 nm-thick planar WO3/BiVO4 film and a 1000 nm-thick nanorod WO3/BiVO4 film indicated that the average traveling time of the photogenerated electrons to the back contact was approximately 2.7 ms (front illumination) and 1.5 ms (back illumination) for the planar WO3/BiVO4 film and 35.3 and 46.8 ms in the nanorod-array WO3/BiVO4 film.

The heterojunction BiVO4/WO3 electrodes were fabricated via layer-by-layer deposition.147 The WO3 films were first prepared by the deposition of a mixture of ammonium metatungstate (AMT) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) on FTO, followed by drying at 80 °C and annealing at 550 °C for 90 min. The BiVO4 films were obtained using a mixture of Bi(NO3)2, ammonium vanadate hydrate and PEI as the coating solution. The resulting six samples were classified as bare WO3, bare BiVO4, composites 1–4, one layer BiVO4/four layers WO3, two layers BiVO4/three layers WO3, three layers BiVO4/two layers WO3 and four layers BiVO4/one layer WO3. The thicknesses of the layers were identical, and the total film thickness of each sample was approximately 3 μm. The XRD patterns indicated that the peaks at 23.3°, 23.8° and 24.6° for the samples calcined at 550 °C corresponded to the (002), (020) and (200) planes of the monoclinic phase of WO3, respectively. The peaks at 18.5° and 29.4° represented a monoclinic structure for BiVO4. The SEM images of composite 1 indicated a porous morphology with particle sizes of ∼100 nm. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) confirmed the layer-by-layer structure of the composite electrode. The measurements of the photocurrent densities were carried out in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution (pH = 6.6) irradiated on the front side (100 mW cm−2). The photocurrent onset potentials of the WO3 and composite films were approximately 0.25 V and 0.05 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. The photocurrents of WO3 were approximately 1.0 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V and 1.65 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Composite 1 exhibited the highest photocurrents, 1.74 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and 2.78 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The photoactivity of the composite 1 electrode was enhanced 74% and 730% compared with the bare WO3 and BiVO4 electrodes, respectively. Mott–Schottky plots indicated that the flat-band potentials of the WO3 and BiVO4 were −0.19 V and −0.58 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. The extrapolation of the Tauc plot to the x-intercepts yielded optical band gaps of 2.77 eV and 2.51 eV for WO3 and BiVO4, respectively.
Chatchai et al. prepared a WO3/BiVO4 composite thin film by subsequent spin coating with a precursor solution of BiVO4 and WO3.148 First, they deposited one WO3 layer onto FTO and then coated the BiVO4 layer on the WO3 to form a FTO/WO3/BiVO4 film electrode. The highest photocurrent was obtained from the composite, in which the deposition of the BiVO4 layer was repeated five times followed by annealing at 550 °C for 1 h. Reference BiVO4, WO3 and reverse sequence BiVO4/WO3 films were also prepared to clarify the mechanism of the charge separation process. AFM and SEM images indicated that the surface became smoother following the deposition of BiVO4 onto the surface of the WO3. The thickness of the WO3/BiVO4 film was approximately 1.1 μm. The XPS spectra indicated that the peaks for W were located at 35.1 and 37.2 eV corresponding to W4f7/2 and W4f5/2, respectively, which were present in the form of WO3 (W6+). The 4f-orbital peaks of Bi can be observed at 158.9 and 164.2 eV, and the 2p-orbital peaks of V appeared at 516.5 eV, which were consistent with BiVO4 (Bi3+ and V5+). The peak at 529.8 eV was assigned to the O1s of WO3 and BiVO4. By comparing the peak intensities of the Bi and W in the XPS spectra, the layer structures of the WO3/BiVO4 and the BiVO4/WO3 films can be discerned. The XRD patterns for BiVO4 and WO3 indicated monoclinic sheelite-type BiVO4 and monoclinic WO3 (2θ = 24°) structures. The diameters of the WO3 and BiVO4 particles were approximately 30 and 20 nm, respectively, estimated according to the XRD peak width based on the Scherrer equation. The measurement of the photocurrent densities was carried out by cyclic voltammetry with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution under irradiation with visible light. Of the WO3/BiVO4, BiVO4/WO3 and BiVO4 electrodes, the WO3/BiVO4 electrode had the highest photocurrent density at a potential greater than 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The BiVO4 electrodes exhibited the lowest photocurrent density due to a more rapid electron–hole recombination at the FTO-BiVO4 interface. The onset potential of the WO3/BiVO4 electrode exhibited a negative shift compared with those of the BiVO4/WO3 and BiVO4 electrodes. The WO3 layer was used as a bridge for the electron transfer from BiVO4 to FTO and significantly suppressed the recombination of the electron–hole pairs in BiVO4. Studies of the photocurrent chronoamperographs of the WO3/BiVO4 and BiVO4 electrodes were conducted at 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution under periodic visible light illumination and confirmed the previously stated conclusion regarding the cyclic voltammetry measurements. The IPCE of the WO3/BiVO4 electrode measured in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution at 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) was approximately 13% and that of the BiVO4 electrode was approximately 1%. The significant enhancement of the solar light conversion efficiency of WO3/BiVO4 was also attributed to suppression of the electron–hole recombination by the addition of a WO3 layer between the BiVO4 and FTO. Nanoparticles of Au were deposited onto the WO3/BiVO4 electrode using 0.1% (w/v) HAuCl4 in a 0.1 M KNO3 solution at −0.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) via electrodeposition.149 SEM images of the WO3/BiVO4 and WO3/BiVO4/Au electrodes showed the Au particle with sizes of 50–100 nm, much smaller than the surface grains of the WO3/BiVO4. The XPS of the WO3/BiVO4/Au electrodes showed peaks of Au0 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 at 83.5 and 87.2 eV, respectively. The XRD patterns also confirmed the presence of a cubic metallic gold crystal structure by the diffraction peaks of the (111), (200) and (220) planes (2θ = 38.2°, 44.4° and 64.5°). Both of the cyclic voltammograms and the linear scan voltammograms confirmed that the photocurrent density of the WO3/BiVO4/Au electrode underwent a more significant enhancement than that of the WO3/BiVO4 electrode because the recombination of holes and electrons was further suppressed by the deposition of Au particles. EIS measurements of the BiVO4, WO3/BiVO4 and WO3/BiVO4/Au electrodes were utilized to explore the charge transfer at the electrodes interfaces. The diameter of the semicircle of Nyquist plots provided the charge transfer resistance parameter (Rct). The Rct values of the above-described electrodes were 305, 48 and 16 kΩ cm−2, respectively, WO3/BiVO4/Au had the largest charge-transfer rate, and BiVO4 had the lowest charge-transfer rate at the electrode interface.
Tacconi et al. prepared a WO3/TiO2 composite using cathodic electrodeposition.150 The photocurrent density of the composite was much higher than those of WO3 and TiO2. The photocurrent onset potential of the composite was approximately −0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution The IPCE of the composite was more than twice those of WO3 and TiO2 in the wavelength range of 250–320 nm.
Smith et al. prepared the quasi-core–shell nanorod arrays of the TiO2/WO3 and WO3/TiO2 using a glancing angle deposition method.151 The SEM images showed that the average height of the initial WO3 nanorods “cores” was 1.5 ± 0.2 μm, and the average diameters at the top and bottom were approximately 300 ± 50 nm and 40 ± 5 nm, respectively. After deposition of the TiO2 “shell”, the height of the WO3/TiO2 nanorods was approximately 1.6 ± 0.2 μm, and the diameters at the top and bottom were approximately 370 ± 40 nm and 45 ± 6 nm. For the TiO2/WO3 composite, the height of the TiO2 nanorod “cores” was approximately 1.6 ± 0.2 μm, and the diameter at the top was approximately 290 ± 40 nm. After deposition of the WO3 “shell”, the height of the TiO2/WO3 nanorods was approximately 1.7 ± 0.3 μm, and the diameter at the top was approximately 350 ± 50 nm. The XRD patterns indicated that the amorphous TiO2 and WO3 layers were transformed into the crystalline phase after annealing at 500 °C. The “core” components displayed more prevalent diffraction peaks than the “shell” components. Linear sweep voltammograms of the annealed TiO2/WO3 and WO3/TiO2 nanorods were carried out in a 0.5 M NaClO4 solution (buffered to pH = 7.0) under darkness and white light illumination (100 mW cm−2). The photocurrent densities of both TiO2/WO3 and WO3/TiO2 were approximately 27 μA cm−2 at 1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Both exhibited a dark current due to water splitting at ∼1.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The dark current of TiO2/WO3 was approximately −70 μA cm−2 at −0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl); however, WO3/TiO2 had a small positive dark current at – 0.5 V. The authors attributed the negative dark current and the photocurrent to the intercalation of Na+ and H+ ions into the WO3 layer. Deintercalation occurred at a higher potential. The IPCE action spectra of the TiO2/WO3 and WO3/TiO2 indicated that the photoresponse of WO3/TiO2 reached nearly 650 nm; however, no photoresponse was found for the TiO2/WO3 in the visible light region. The TiO2/WO3 showed a greater photocurrent in the UV region. Conversely, WO3/TiO2 exhibited a larger photocurrent in the visible light region. The Mott–Schottky plots of the TiO2/WO3 and WO3/TiO2 nanorod cells at 10 kHz indicated that the flat-band potentials (VFB) were approximately −0.28 V and −0.21 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. Their charge carrier densities (ND) were approximately 1.47 × 1020 cm−3 and 3.41 × 1019, and their space charge thicknesses (W) were calculated as 5.07 nm and 2.61 nm.
Using Ti metal as a substrate, Luca et al. prepared TiO2-Ti, WO3-Ti, TiO2/WO3/Ti, WO3/TiO2/Ti, TiO2/WO3/TiO2/Ti and WO3/TiO2/WO3/Ti composites to explore their photoelectrochemical activity for use as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting.152 In these composites, TiO2 exhibited an amorphous structure, and WO3 a crystalline structure after annealing at 400 °C. Each component had dimensions of 10–20 nm on the Ti substrates. After annealing at 400 °C, diffusion of the Ti into the WO3 and W into the TiO2 were observed. Both defect states and the configuration of the multilayer component stack of the heterojunction structures were important to the photocatalytic activity for water splitting. The photocurrent densities of these composites were measured at potentials of 0.1–0.8 V (vs. SCE) in a 0.1 M H2SO4 solution under illumination (80 mW cm−2), and were found to follow the order TiO2/Ti < WO3/TiO2/WO3/Ti < WO3/TiO2/Ti < WO3/Ti < TO2/WO3/Ti < TiO2/WO3/TiO2/Ti. WO3/Ti exhibited higher photocurrents at potentials exceeding 0.8 V. TiO2/WO3/Ti and TiO2/WO3/TiO2/Ti exhibited relatively strong photocurrents at lower applied biases, which were attributed to higher conduction band energy positions in the TiO2 phase relative to the WO3. The photocurrent density of the WO3/Ti film was seven times higher than that of the TiO2/Ti film at 1 V (vs. SCE). The WO3/TiO2/Ti and TiO2/WO3/Ti absorbed ∼1.4% and 0.9% of the incident photons, respectively. However, TiO2/WO3/Ti converted 19–27% of these to a photocurrent at 1 V (vs. SCE), which was three times more than that converted by WO3/TiO2/Ti. TiO2/WO3/TiO2/Ti captured only 1.1% of the light but converted 42–44% of it to the photocurrent, which was a much higher efficiency than that of WO3/TiO2/WO3/Ti.
A CdS-TiO2-WO3 ternary hybrid was synthesized using a two-step procedure.153 First, a TiO2-WO3 binary hybrid was prepared by mixing a tungsten acid solution with an aqueous TiO2 suspension in varying molar ratios, and the mixture was then calcinated at 450 °C for 4 h. Second, a solution of 4 mM sodium sulfide was added dropwise to an aqueous suspension of the TiO2-WO3 hybrid and 4 mM cadmium acetate. The optimum molar ratio of the ternary hybrid was 1:1:1 for CdS-TiO2-WO3. The crystalline phases of the CdS-TiO2-WO3 were analyzed by comparing the XRD of the ternary hybrid with that of the TiO2-WO3, CdS, WO3, and TiO2. The results indicated patterns of cubic CdS and monoclinic WO3, along with anatase and rutile TiO2. Diffuse reflectance UV/visible absorption spectra (DRUVS) exhibited a red shift in the absorption edge of the ternary hybrid from 440 nm to 530 nm compared with that of the TiO2-WO3 binary hybrid. The optical band gap of the CdS-TiO2-WO3 was approximately 2.41 eV. The high-resolution transmission electron micrographs (HRTEM) for CdS-TiO2-WO3 exhibited the (111) plane of cubic CdS, the (002) plane of monoclinic WO3 and the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 with lattice spacings of 0.336 nm, 0.386 nm and 0.354 nm, respectively. These values are consistent with the patterns obtained by selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Five types of photoanodes were prepared: CdS-TiO2-WO3, CdS-TiO2, CdS-WO3, TiO2-WO3 and CdS on FTO glass, after annealing at 450 °C for 30 min. Of these photoanodes, CdS-TiO2-WO3 displayed the maximum photocurrent density of 1.6 mA cm−2 at 0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under irradiation with visible light (λ > 495 nm) irradiation. Given the same conditions, the photocurrent density of CdS was approximately 0.3 mA cm−2, and those of the binary hybrids CdS-TiO2 and CdS-WO3 were approximately 0.6 and 0.8 mA cm−2, respectively. The onset potential was reduced to between approximately −1.0 and −1.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The ternary hybrid CdS-TiO2-WO3 photoanode exhibited a maximum IPCE of ≥ 50% at the incident wavelengths from 360 to 490 nm at 0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicated that the CdS-TiO2-WO3 photoanode had the smallest charge-transfer resistance on the electrode surface among the CdS-containing photoanodes. The charge separation and transfer were enhanced in the composite of the ternary hybrid CdS-TiO2-WO3 compared with the bare CdS and binary hybrid composites. This result was attributed to cascading electron transfer from CdS to TiO2 to WO3 through the interfacial potential gradient in the ternary conduction bands.
Sivula et al. prepared a WO3/Fe2O3 composite using atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD).154 A WO3 film for use as the scaffold was first obtained by the APCVD of W(CO)6 on FTO. Then, silicon-doped Fe2O3 was deposited onto the WO3 film using the same procedure. SEM images indicated that the WO3 film was a porous structure with faceted grains of 20–200 nm. After the deposition of the iron oxide at a rate of 100 nm min−1 for 1 min, 10 nm silicon-doped iron oxide particles were formed on a WO3/Fe2O3 film of approximately 300 nm in thickness. The onset potential of the dark current was approximately 1.6 V (vs. RHE). The onset potential of the photo current was approximately 1.0 V (vs. RHE). The photocurrent density was approximately 1.71 mA cm−2 at 1.43 V (vs. RHE) in a 1 M NaOH (pH = 13.6) solution under illumination (100 mW cm−2), which was an increase of 21% compared with that of bare α-Fe2O3 (1.41 mA cm−2) under the same conditions. In general, WO3 electrodes are not stable in basic solutions, the fact that the WO3/Fe2O3 composite remained stable over multiple scans indicated that the WO3 layer can be effectively protected from contact with the electrolyte by an iron oxide layer. The absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) of the WO3/Fe2O3 composite at 565 nm increased 40% compared with that of a bare α-Fe2O3 electrode.
Kim et al. prepared a CdSe/CdS/ZnO/WOx heterojunction as a photoanode for photoelectrochemical water splitting.155 The WOx nanowhiskers were first synthesized by the thermal evaporation of WO3 powder onto a W substrate (50–100 mTorr, 1050 °C, 1 h). A ZnO seed layer was deposited onto the WOx nanowhiskers via the sputtering method, and ZnO nanowires were grown on the seed layer using the hydrothermal method with Zn(NO3)2·6H2O as a precursor at 95 °C for 6 h. The low band gap semiconductors CdS and CdSe were successively deposited onto the ZnO/WOx composite via successive ion layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) and chemical bath deposition (CBD). The deposition of CdS was carried out in 100 mM CdSO4 followed by a 100 mM Na2S aqueous solution at room temperature. The deposition of CdSe was carried out in a solution containing 2.5 mM Cd(CH3COO)2, 2.5 mM Na2SeSO3 and 45 mM NH4OH at 95 °C for 3 h. SEM images indicated hierarchical ZnO/WOx nanostructures consisting of internal WOx nanowhiskers and highly dense external ZnO nanowire branches. The diameters and lengths of nanowires were approximately 20–50 nm and 2 μm, respectively. TEM analysis indicated a highly uniform polycrystalline nanostructure. A 6–7 nm-thick CdS formed on the ZnO nanowires following 20 cycles of the SILAR process. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) also confirmed that the CdS shell was coated onto the ZnO nanowires. SEM and TEM images confirmed that polycrystalline CdSe nanoparticles with an average diameter of 6.5 nm were deposited onto the ZnO/CdS core–shell nanowires. After deposition of the CdSe/CdS onto the hierarchical ZnO/WOx, the resulting CdSe/CdS/ZnO/WOx composite exhibited visible light absorption up to approximately 800 nm due to the low band gap properties of CdS (2.4 eV) and CdSe (1.7 eV). The highest photocurrent density was at approximately 11 mA cm−2 at −0.5 V (vs. SCE) in a mixture of Na2S (0.25 M) and Na2SO3 (0.35 M) under illumination (100 mW cm−2). The highest conversion efficiency (PCE) was approximately 6.14% at −0.84 V (vs. SCE) (shown in Fig. 8).

Using atomic layer deposition (ALD), crystalline WO3 can be grown in the true ALD regime with ITO as the supporting substrate without the production of corrosive byproducts. Under optimized growth conditions, the thickness of the deposition layer was approximately 180 nm. After annealing at 550 °C, a 2 nm-thick Mn-oxo dimmer catalyst film was deposited onto the surface of the WO3 under optimized conditions ([catalyst] = 1 mM, 75 °C, 5 min).156 The photocurrent and onset potential of the resulting WO3/Mn catalyst composite exhibited no significant difference compared with a bare WO3 photoanode (pH = 4, 100 mW cm−2). This finding was consistent with the results obtained through the incident-photon-to-charge conversion efficiency (IPCE) and the absorbed-photon-to-charge conversion efficiency (APCE). However, the amount of O2 evolved on bare WO3 was approximately 50% of that of the WO3/Mn composite after 3 h. Under neutral conditions (pH = 7), the performance of bare WO3 quickly decreased to 40% after 1 h, and the performance of the WO3/Mn composite remained 96% after 2 h. These results indicated that the Mn catalyst played a significant role in protecting the WO3, especially, at pH = 7. The photocurrent was approximately 2.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. RHE); however, a low energy-conversion efficiency of 0.59% was obtained at 1.23 V (vs. RHE). The rate of evolved O2 was approximately 13.6 μmol cm−2 h−1.
Seabold and Choi studied the effect of a cobalt-based O2 evolution catalyst on the stability and selectivity of a WO3 photoanode.157 The WO3 films were prepared via electrodeposition using peroxotungstate as a precursor. After annealing at 500 °C for 1 h, a Co-Pi layer (>1.5 μm) was electrodeposited onto the WO3 electrode using a mixture of 0.5 mM CoCl2 and 0.1 M KH2PO4 at 1.1 V (pH = 7). The photocurrent of the bare WO3 electrode dropped to 37% of its initial value in the first hour, and no photoactivity could be detected after 12 h. The photocurrent of the WO3/Co-Pi electrode was approximately 0.35 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH = 7) under illumination (100 mW cm−2). SEM images indicated that the reduction of photoactivity was caused by photodissolution of the WO3 electrode after illumination for 2 h or soaking for 24 h. The photocorrosion observed during illumination indicated that peroxo species were formed on the WO3 surface, as was confirmed by a linear sweep voltammogram (LSV). The LSV of a WO3 electrode illuminated for 2 h exhibited a peak at −0.3 V, which was assigned to surface peroxo species that can be removed via thermal treatment. The O2 evolution of bare WO3 and WO3/Co-Pi electrodes was measured using a fluorescence-based O2 sensor. The results indicated that the bare WO3 electrode utilized only 61% of its separated holes for O2 evolution. An anodic current of 39% was produced by the formation of the peroxo species with separated holes. In contrast, 100% of the photocurrent of WO3/Co-Pi electrode was produced by the evolution of O2. This result indicated that the kinetics of the O2 evolution reaction were obviously enhanced by the Co-Pi electrodeposited onto the WO3. The WO3/Co-Pi electrode can achieve an anodic current of 3.0 mA cm−2 at 1.09 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in the dark, and a potential of approximately 1.85 V was applied to the WO3 to achieve the same current. The onset potential difference of WO3 and WO3/Co-Pi was approximately 500 mV in darkness. The photocurrent densities of WO3 and WO3/Co-Pi were approximately 0.45 mA cm−2 and 0.25 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a 0.1 M KH2PO4 buffer solution (pH = 7) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 under chopped illumination (100 mW cm−2). The photocurrent onset potential and the flat-band potential (VFB) for the bare WO3 were approximately −0.03 V and −0.28 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. In contrast, the photocurrent onset potential and the flat-band potential (VFB) for the WO3/Co-Pi were approximately −0.20 V and −0.05 V, respectively.
7. WO3 in a dual-bed water splitting system
The overall water splitting can be carried out using a dual bed photocatalysts system, which was composed of a redox mediator and two different photocatalysts: Pt-WO3 for O2 evolution and Pt-loaded p-type semiconductor for H2 evolution (Fig. 9).

Sayama et al. investigated photocatalytic water splitting using Pt-WO3 and SrTiO3 (Cr-Ta-doped).158 The SrTiO3 (Cr-Ta-doped) was prepared from a mixture of Cr2O3, Ta2O5, SrCO3 and TiO2 by annealing at 1100 °C. The onset optical band for SrTiO3 (Cr-Ta-doped) was approximately 1.77 eV. Pt-loaded SrTiO3 (Cr-Ta-doped) produced H2 at an initial rate of 0.8 μmol h−1 from an aqueous NaI solution under visible light (λ > 420 nm). The Pt-loaded WO3 produced O2 at an initial rate of 84 μmol h−1 in an aqueous NaIO3 solution under irradiation with visible light. The combination of Pt-WO3 and Pt-SrTiO3 (Cr-Ta-doped) in an aqueous NaI solution can catalyze the evolution of both H2 and O2 under visible light (Fig. 7). In this system, the H2 evolution rate was approximately 1.8 μmol h−1, which was higher than that of Pt-SrTiO3 (Cr-Ta-doped) alone (0.8 μmol h−1). The rates of H2 and O2 evolution were approximately 0.21 and 0.11 μmol h−1, respectively, under monochromatic light through a bandpass filter (420.7 nm, 57 mW). The quantum efficiency was approximately 0.1% at this wavelength.
Bae et al. constructed a dual-bed photocatalytic water splitting system using Rh-doped SrTiO3 and WO3, both Pt-loaded, as photocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution, respectively.159 Rh-doped SrTiO3 was prepared using a hydrothermal method at 443 K followed by calcination at 1273 K. Ag+/Ag, Fe3+/Fe2+, IO3−/I−, Ce4+/Ce3+ and Sn4+/Sn2+ were chosen as redox mediators to perform redox reactions with the photogenerated electrons and holes. The CB and VB positions of the Rh-doped SrTiO3 were approximately −0.2 and 2.3 V (vs. NHE). Those of WO3 were approximately 0.5 and 3.1 V (vs. NHE). Photocatalytic activities using various electron acceptors with a concentration of 10 mM were tested by dissolving 0.2 g WO3 in a 100 mL aqueous solution. Ag+ exhibited the highest activity as an electron acceptor for photocatalytic O2 evolution. However, it was irreversible under the reaction conditions. The system using Fe3+ as the electron acceptor yielded a rate of 11.7 mmol h−1 for photocatalytic water oxidation and provided a reversible redox reaction at the given conditions. For H2 evolution with Rh-doped SrTiO3, Sn2+, Fe2+ and I− ions were chosen as electron donors under visible light irradiation. The initial rates of hydrogen evolution in this system followed the order of Sn2+ (1.90 μmol h−1) > Fe2+(1.30 μmol h−1) > I− (0.70 μmol h−1). In a simulated dual-bed operation using Fe3+/Fe2+ as the redox mediator, the rate of H2 and O2 evolution were approximately 2.7 and 1.1 μmol h−1, respectively. The rate of O2 evolution was much less than that when WO3 alone is used as the photoanode (11.7 μmol).
Photocatalytic water splitting was carried out using a combination of Pt-TaON and Pt-WO3 photocatalysts in a 5 mM aqueous NaI solution (pH = 7) under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm).160 TaON was prepared by calcination of Ta2O5 powder under an NH3 flow (20 ml min−1) at 1123 K for 15 h. Pt-TaON and Pt-WO3 were prepared from [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 and a H2PtCl6 solution, followed by the reduction of H2 over 2 h at 573 K and calcination for 1 h at 773 K, respectively. The H2 and O2 simultaneously evolved with initial rates of 24 and 12 μmol h−1 by the combination of Pt (0.3 wt%)-TaON and Pt (0.5 wt%)-WO3 in a 5 mM aqueous NaI solution (pH = 7) under visible light (λ > 420 nm). The rate of H2 evolution over Pt-TaON alone was only ∼1 μmol h−1. Because the concentration of IO3− can remain lower in the combination of Pt-TaON and Pt-WO3 than in Pt-TaON alone, in which the photoexcited electron of Pt-WO3 reduces IO3− to I−. The quantum efficiency was approximately 0.4% at 420 nm.
Higashi et al. reported an effective system consisting of ATaO2N (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) and Pt-WO3 for overall water splitting under visible light.161,162 ATaO2N (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) possessed smaller band gaps than those of TaON, and could thus utilize more visible light. CaTaO2N and BaTaO2N were utilized as photocatalysts for H2 evolution and Pt-WO3 was utilized as the photocatalyst for O2 evolution. ATaO2N was prepared by heating the A2Ta2O7 precursors under an NH3 flow at 1123–1273 K for 20 h, and the A2Ta2O7 was prepared using a polymerized complex method in a methanol solution containing TaCl5 and ACO3, followed by calcination at 873 K. The XRD patterns of CaTaO2N and SrTaO2N only exhibited peaks corresponding to the perovskite phase. For BaTaO2N, weak peaks corresponding to the Ta3N5 phase were observed in addition to the above-mentioned perovskite phase peaks. SEM images of CaTaO2N and SrTaO2N exhibited distinct crystal growths at 1123–1273 K in highly aggregated forms with constituent particles with diameters of less than 100 nm. The BaTaO2N consisted of particles with sizes of 100–200 nm. The investigation into the dependence of photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution on the preparation temperature in an aqueous methanol solution under visible light (λ > 420 nm) indicated that Pt-CaTaO2N and Pt-SrTaO2N produced the greatest H2 evolution at 1173 K, and Pt-BaTaO2N at 1223 K. The optimized H2 evolution rates were 50 μmol h−1, 42 μmol h−1 and 24 μmol h−1 for Pt-BaTaO2N, Pt-SrTaO2N and Pt-CaTaO2N, respectively. Pt-CaTaO2N produced much more H2 in the solution containing NaI than did Pt-BaTaO2N. A considerable amount of N2 was detected over Pt-SrTaO2N accompanying the H2 evolution. Overall water splitting under visible light was carried out using a combination of Pt-ATaO2N and Pt-WO3 in an aqueous NaI solution (5 mM). The combination of Pt-ATaO2N (A = Ba, Ca) and Pt-WO3 photocatalysts produced H2 and O2 simultaneously at nearly a stoichiometric ratio (H2:O2 = 2:1). The combination of Pt-BaTaO2N (A = Ba, Ca) and Pt-WO3 provided the first example in which overall water splitting was achieved with wavelengths longer than 600 nm. However, the combination of Pt-SrTaO2N and Pt-WO3 failed to split water; an observation that could be attributed to the self-oxidative decomposition of SrTaO2N.
Conclusions
This review on the development of WO3 photoanodes for photocatalytic water splitting has been presented. The enhancements of photocatalytic performance can be associated with the methods of preparation, ion doping and WO3 composites. The morphology, dimension, crystallinity, grain boundaries and defect state of WO3 films can be modified using the different procedures of fabrication. The ion doping can alter the band gap energy level of WO3 photoanodes. Efficient charge separation can be performed using WO3 composites by suppressing the recombination of electrons and holes. For bare WO3 it is hard to meet simultaneously these efficiency-limited factors based on the electronic structure itself. The cocatalyst promoting H2 evolution may be indispensable for enhancing the efficiency of water splitting. The new materials based on metal W, such as alloys, maybe also can make the valence band edge deeper or rise up the conducting band edge. However, much work needs to be performed for an industrial application that converts light to chemical energy to become practical.
