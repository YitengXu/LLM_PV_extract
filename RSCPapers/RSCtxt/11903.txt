    , Accepted 16th January 2019First published on 16th January 2019AbstractThe zinc sulfide (ZnS) nanowires (NWs)/analite (Cu7S4) nanoparticles (NPs)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites were fabricated for the first time using a one-pot hydrothermal method, and the resulting nanocomposites can be used as a photocatalyst and the electrode for a supercapacitor. The ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites showed excellent electrochemical performance with the maximum specific capacitance of 1114 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, good cycling stability with capacitance retention of 88% after 5000 cycles and low charge transfer resistance of 0.011 Ω. The ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites were used as the positive electrode together with active carbon as the negative electrode for the fabrication of an asymmetric supercapacitor device, which exhibited a maximum energy density of 22 W h kg−1 as well as a power density up to 595 W kg−1 with capacitance retention of 77% after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites exhibited superior photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet and visible light irradiation because of the high surface area, small interface transfer resistance and efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes caused by the synergistic effect between ZnS NWs, Cu7S4 NPs and rGO.
1. Introduction
Supercapacitors (SCs), known as electrochemical capacitors, have aroused widespread interest because of their superior power density, long cycle life, fast charge–discharge rate, low maintenance cost and good safety compared with secondary batteries.1,2 Based on the mechanism of charge storage, an SC can be classified into electrical double layer capacitors (EDLC) and pseudo-capacitors. The key factor that determines the property of the SC is the electrochemical performance of the electrode materials. Carbon-based nanomaterials (graphene, carbon nanotubes, and so on) are usually used as the electrode materials for EDLCs because of their high specific surface area and high electrical conductivity.3,4 The capacitance arises from the physical electrostatic charge storage, resulting in a low energy to power ratio, which hinders their further application. In contrast, pseudo-capacitor materials such as conducting polymers, transition metal oxides/sulfides or their composites can exhibit high specific capacitance and energy density. Because they use a fast and reversible Faraday reaction for charge storage on the electrode surface.5–7 However, the drawbacks associated with the low electrical conductivity, and the poor cyclic stability because of their volume change during the electrochemical reaction are difficult to avoid. Therefore, exploitation of a novel electrode with a designed hybrid structure has been attracting increased attention because of its large active surface area, superior cyclability and high energy and power density.
The transition metal sulfides (TMSs) have recently received great attention for potential applications as SCs because of their lower cost, richer redox valences, higher electrical conductivity than metal oxides.8 Various TMSs such as cobalt sulfide (CoS),9 nickel sulfide (NiS),10 zinc sulfide (ZnS),11 molybdenum sulfide (MoS2),12 copper sulfide (CuS),13 manganese sulfide (MnS)14 have been intensively studied and used for SC electrodes as well as a photocatalyst because of their special electrochemical performance and high catalytic activities. Among them, copper sulfide (CuxS, x = 1–2), an important p-type semiconductor with a band gap of 1.2–2.4 eV, which shows excellent metal-like electronic conductivity (10−3 S cm−1), high theoretical capacity (561 mA h g−1), and a complex structure,15,16 and is a prospective candidate electrode for SCs. Anilite (Cu7S4) with a Cu:S ratio of 1.75 is the most stable structure in the nonstoichiometric CuxS system [CuS, spionkopite (Cu1.39S), geerite (Cu1.6S), Cu7S4, digenite (Cu9S5), copper(I) sulfite (Cu2S)], resulting in a relatively good retention performance.17 Another sulfide, ZnS (Eg = 3.6 eV at 300 K) is also widely used as an electrode material and photocatalyst because of its advantages of good electrical conductivity and highly negative reduction potentials of the excited electrons.18,19 It was found that the composites of two types of TMS tend to have better electrochemical properties, wider solar energy absorption range and higher photocatalytic efficiency than a single component sulfide. Cao et al. synthesized hollow, cubic, double layer structured nanocomposites for use in a high-performance supercapacitor using a self-generated sacrificial template method, which exhibited the highest specific capacitances of 1204 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1.20 Zhang et al. developed a sequential chemical etching, sulfidation and cation-exchange strategy for preparing multi-shelled zinc sulfide–cadmium sulfide (ZnS–CdS) rhombic dodecahedral cages with tunable compositions and shell numbers, which showed enhanced photoelectrochemical performance for solar energy conversion.21 It is worth noting that ZnS/Cu7S4 nanocomposites have not yet been reported. However, the unsatisfying stability of the sulfide nanomaterials still remains a common issue which needs to be solved. The introduction of carbon (carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbon, carbon fiber and graphene)22–24 into TMS-based nanocomposites might be an effective strategy. Two-dimensional (2D) graphene is an ideal choice because of its high specific surface area (2600 m2 g−1), superior mobility of charge carriers (10000 cm2 V−1 s−1), high mechanical strength and chemical stability.26 Hu et al. have anchored a ZnS-MoS2 solid solution on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheet, using a solvent thermal method, which exhibited excellent photocatalytic degradation performance and long-term stability.25 Thus, if graphene is used as the matrix for ZnS/Cu7S4 nanocomposites, it can not only avoid the volumetric changes of ZnS/Cu7S4 during the charge–discharge process, but also offers a large electrode/electrolyte interface for better ion diffusion. Meanwhile, ZnS/Cu7S4 nanocomposites can also prevent the aggregation and restacking of graphene, and increase the accessible surface area. In the research described in this paper, novel ZnS nanowires (NWs)/Cu7S4 nanoparticles (NPs)/rGO nanocomposites were developed using a simple hydrothermal method for the first time, which exhibited excellent supercapacitor and photocatalytic performance (Fig. 1).

2. Experimental section

Materials: Zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), cupric nitrate [Cu(NO3)2·3H2O], thiourea, ethylenediamine (EN), graphite powder, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, potassium permanganate, hydrogen peroxide 30% aqueous solution, potassium persulfate, phosphorus pentoxide, potassium hexacyanoferrate, potassium hydroxide (KOH) were all analytical grade were obtained from Shanghai Chemical Reagent, and used without further purification.
2.1 Preparation of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites
The graphene oxide (GO) used in the current experiments was synthesized using an improved Hummers’ method, which was reported in a previous paper.27 The ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites were prepared using a hydrothermal method. In a typical process, 0.01 g of GO was dispersed in 20 ml of deionized water and ethanol (1:1 v/v) using ultrasonic mixing for 1 h (solution A). The Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were dissolved in 10 ml of deionized water (solution B). The molar ratio of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O to Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was x (x = 0, 0.10, 0.30, 0.50, 0.70, 0.90, 1.0). The total amount of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was 1 mmol. Then, 3 mmol of thiourea was dispersed in 10 ml of EN using ultrasonic mixing for 1 h (solution C). Solutions B and C were gradually added dropwise to solution A under vigorous stirring for 1 h. Then, the colloid solution was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 12 h. After the reaction, the autoclave was taken out and cooled down to room temperature. The resulting nanocomposites were isolated using centrifugation and washed several times with ethanol and deionized water, and then dried at 60 °C for 6 h.
2.2 Fabrication of electrodes
The active material (the as-prepared ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites), acetylene black (conductive agent) and poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE; binder) were mixed in a mass ratio of 8:1:1 in ethanol to form a slurry with continuous stirring. The slurry was then coated on to carbon cloth and dried at 60 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. The mass loading of the active material was 61 mg cm−2.
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical performance of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites was evaluated on a PARSTAT 4000 electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research, USA) using a conventional three-electrode system, in which the as-prepared electrode hybrids (1 × 1 cm2), platinum foil (2 × 2 cm2) and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charging–discharging (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in a mixed solution of 6 M KOH and potassium ferricyanide at room temperature. Cycling tests of the electrode were conducted using a LANHE CT2001A (Land Instruments) battery measurement system. The specific capacitance calculated from the CV curves was based on the following equation: (1)where CCV is the specific capacitance, Δq is obtained by integrating the current within the potential window for a particular scan rate, v is the scan rate, ΔV is the potential window in the curve, and m is the mass deposited on the electrode.
The specific capacitance calculated from GCD curves was based on the following equation: (2)where CGCD is the specific capacitance, I (A) refers to the discharge current, ΔV represents the potential change within the discharge time Δt (s), and m corresponds to the total weight of the ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites.
For the construction of an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites and active carbon were used as positive and negative electrodes, respectively, and separated by cellulose paper in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The energy density and power density of the ASC device was calculated using the following equations: (3) (4) (5)where C is the capacitance of ASC, I (A) represents the discharge current, ΔV (V) refers to the potential change within the discharge time Δt (s), m (g) is the total mass of the two active electrode materials, E and P correspond to the energy density (W h kg−1) and power density (W kg−1), respectively.
2.4 Photocatalytic activity measurement
The photocatalytic activity of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites was evaluated using the degradation of methylene blue (MB) in water under visible and ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. Visible light irradiation was obtained using a 300 W xenon lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter. The UV light irradiation was obtained using a 250 W high pressure mercury lamp with the wavelength centered at 365 nm. Prior to irradiation, 25 mg of catalyst was added to 100 ml of MB solution (7 mg l−1), which was then magnetically stirred for 20 min in the dark to reach an adsorption–desorption equilibrium. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was continuously stirred under visible and UV light irradiation at room temperature. After 20 min, 2 ml of the suspension was withdrawn and centrifuged to remove the catalyst. The degraded solution was analyzed using and UV-5800(PC) UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shanghai Metash Instruments Co., Ltd) and the characteristic absorption peak of MB solution at 664 nm was monitored. This experiment was also performed with pure ZnS NWs, Cu7S4 NPs and ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs for comparison.
2.5 Characterization of products
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns was collected using a MXP-18 X-ray diffractometer (MAC Science) with a copper target radiation source. Transmission electron micrographs (TEM), and high-resolution transmission electron micrographs (HRTEM) were taken using a JEM-2100 (Jeol) electron microscope. The specimen was prepared by depositing a drop of the dilute solution of the sample on a carbon coated copper grid which was dried at room temperature. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) microanalysis were performed on an XL-30 instrument (FEI Company). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Vertex 70 spectrophotometer (Bruker) using KBr pellets. The X-ray photoelectron analysis (XPS) was performed on a ESCALab MK II X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (VG Scientific) using Mg Kα radiation (hν = 1253.6 eV) with a resolution of 1.0 eV. The binding energy values obtained from the XPS analysis were corrected by referencing the C 1s peak to 284.60 eV. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum was obtained using a Lambda 900 UV/Vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer). The specific surface area was determined using the Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) method using nitrogen (N2) adsorption–desorption isotherms generated on a Nova 1000 analyzer (Nova Instruments.
3. Results and discussion
The XRD analysis was used to confirm the crystal phase and ingredients of the as-prepared ZnS, Cu7S4 and ZnS/Cu7S4 nanocomposites. As shown by the red line in Fig. 2, the typical diffraction pattern of the pure ZnS exhibited an intense peak at 2θ = 28.58° oriented along the (002) crystal plane, and the other diffraction peaks at 27.03°, 30.54°, 39.62°, 47.56°, 51.8°, 56.33°, matched well with those of the standard hexagonal ZnS (JCPDS No. 36-1450). For Cu7S4 (Fig. 2, pink line), the diffraction peaks centered at 27.75°, 29.3°, 32.19°, 46.22° and 54.79° were readily indexed to the (202), (113), (220), (224), (026) lattice planes, respectively, of the standard hexagonal Cu7S4 (JCPDS No. 33-0489). For the ZnS/Cu7S4 nanocomposites, with the increase in molar ratio of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O to Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, the diffraction peaks of ZnS were weakened, whereas the characteristic peaks of Cu7S4 were gradually strengthened, indicating that more Cu7S4 existed in the ZnS/Cu7S4 nanocomposites.

The typical TEM and HRTEM images of ZnS, ZnS/Cu7S4 nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the ZnS NWs have good dispersibility with a uniform diameter of about 10 nm and length up to 200 nm (Fig. 3a). The lattice fringes of the ZnS NWs can be clearly observed in Fig. 3b, suggesting a well-defined crystal structure, and the fringe with the lattice spacing of 0.31 nm corresponded to the (002) plane of hexagonal ZnS.28 It can be concluded that the ZnS NWs grew along the (002) direction (c-axis). Fig. 3c clearly confirms that Cu7S4 NPs were uniformly deposited on the surface of ZnS NWs without destroying its morphology or structure, and the surface area covered with less Cu7S4 NPs provided a more exposed area of ZnS NWs. The HRTEM image (Fig. 3d) shows the lattice mismatch between Cu7S4 NPs and ZnS NWs, which exhibit the core–shell feature of the nanocomposites.

The crystal structure and morphology of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites were studied using XRD and FESEM. As shown in the inset of Fig. 4a, the diffraction peak at 10.8° was the characteristic peak of the (002) plane of GO, indicating that GO forms a well-ordered layered structure.28 It should be noted that this peak has disappeared at 21° and the weak peak of rGO had emerged, and the other peaks are well matched with the diffraction peaks of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs (the inset of Fig. 4b), which indicated the formation of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites.28 The FESEM image of the prepared GO (Fig. 4a) confirmed that GO with the evident wrinkles possessed a large surface area, and no agglomeration was found, and so could serve as a perfect 2D supporting matrix for the immobilization of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs nanocomposites. As seen in Fig. 4b, a large amount of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs nanocomposites were decorated homogeneously on the lamellar rGO nanosheets. The close view of these ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites shows that ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs nanocomposites (Fig. 4c–d yellow circle) wrap on the surface of rGO (Fig. 4c–d red arrow). The surface of the ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs nanocomposites was rough because of the Cu7S4 NPs deposited on the surface of the ZnS NWs. As expected, the loading of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NP nanocomposites inhibited the rGO nanosheets from efficiently stacking with each other, which helped with the good retention of the excellent properties of rGO. The chemical composition of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites was determined using EDX, as shown in Fig. 4e. This clearly confirmed the presence of C, Cu, S, and Zn elements (other peaks originate from the substrate used) in the ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites, which unambiguously proved that the nanocomposites were composed of ZnS NWs, Cu7S4 NPs, and rGO.

The FTIR spectra of the pristine GO, ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs and ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 5a. The characteristic bands of GO (Fig. 5a, red line) can be observed at 1050 cm−1 (alkoxy C–O stretching vibration29), 1230 cm−1 (carboxyl O–H stretching30), 1400 cm−1 (carboxyl C–O stretching29), 1624 cm−1 (stretching and bending modes of O–H and H–O–H groups of absorbed water31 or the in-plane vibrations of sp2 hybridized C–C bonding30), and 1726 cm−1 (CO stretching vibrations of carboxyl or carbonyl groups32). The spectrum also shows a broad band at 3400 cm−1 that corresponded to the O–H stretching vibrations of the adsorbed water molecules.32 However, these characteristic peaks of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of GO mostly disappear, except for the residual C–O band at 1120 cm−1, in the case of the ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites (Fig. 5a, blue line), indicating that the GO has successfully been reduced to rGO.33 Furthermore, the Cu–S stretching mode can be observed at 614 cm−1 in ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites, which suggested the formation of Cu–S on the rGO nanosheets.34 It was noted that the ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites (Fig. 5a, blue line) had a similar spectrum to the ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs nanocomposites (Fig. 5a, green line), which demonstrated that the ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs nanocomposites were the main components in the as-prepared ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites.35

The surface element composition and chemical valence state of GO, ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs and ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites were further identified using XPS measurements, and the results are shown in Fig. 5b–f. The peaks of Zn 2p, Cu 2p, S 2p, O 1s, and C 1s are clearly observed in the XPS survey spectra of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs (Fig. 5b, green line) and ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites (Fig. 5b, blue dashed line), which were consistent with the results of the XRD and EDX analyses. The weak peaks of O 1s and C 1s come from the H2O, O2, CO2 adsorbed on the surface of the ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs (Fig. 5b, green line) or ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites (Fig. 5b, blue dashed line). Whereas, the strong peaks of O 1s and C 1s were only detected in the spectrum of GO (Fig. 5b, red dotted line). Fig. 5c–f show the high resolution XPS spectra of Zn 2p, Cu 2p, S 2p, and C 1s of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs and ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites. In Fig. 5c, two strong and symmetrical peaks at 1021.7 eV and 1044.81 eV for ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs nanocomposites (green line) were ascribed to the binding energies of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, and indicated the existence of Zn2+.36 For the Cu 2p spectrum of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs nanocomposites (Fig. 5d, green line), two typical symmetrical peaks appeared at 932.1 eV and 952.1 eV, which corresponded to the binding energy of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. However, the binding energy of Cu 2p cannot be used to distinguish between CuS and Cu2S because of their close values. The only effective difference can be seen in the binding energy of S 2p.37 The S 2p spectrum of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs nanocomposites (Fig. 5e, green line) consists of a spin–orbit coupling with binding energies of 161.4 eV and 162.5 eV, representing S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively, confirming the presence of S2− in Cu7S4.38–40 Thus, ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs nanocomposites are composed of ZnS NWs and Cu7S4 NPs, which was consistent with the XRD results. Compared with that of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs nanocomposites (Fig. 5c–e, green line), the slight shift of binding energies of Zn 2p, Cu 2p, S 2p in ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites (Fig. 5c–e, blue line) indicated the interactions of electron transfer between ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs and rGO.41 The C 1s spectrum of GO (Fig. 5f, red line) showed three peaks centered at 284.8 eV (non-oxygenated C–C), 287.4 eV (epoxyl and hydroxyl CO), and 289.2 eV (carbonyl C–O).42,43 The peak intensity of CO and C–O in ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites (Fig. 5f, blue line) decreased significantly, suggesting that most of the oxygen containing functional groups had been successfully after removed the hydrothermal treatment process.
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm was measured to evaluate the specific surface area and pore size distribution of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites. As shown in Fig. 6a, the isotherm displays a typical type IV curve with the type H3 hysteresis loop at relative pressure (P/P0) between 0.4 and 1.0, suggesting the presence of some mesoporous structure.44 The ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites had a broad pore size distribution and the most probable diameter was about 24.5 nm, 36 nm and 64 nm, respectively. The mesopores may be formed by the interconnection or aggregation of small Cu7S4 NPs, which can also be seen from the TEM and FESEM micrographs (Fig. 3c and 4c). The BET specific surface area and pore volume of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites were 27.69 m2 g−1 and 0.065 cm3 g−1, respectively. The large specific surface area can provide more active sites for reactions, and more diffusion paths for the related ion transport and electrolyte penetration, which was beneficial to the improvement of the photocatalytic and supercapacitor performance.45–48

Fig. 7a displays the UV-Vis absorption spectra of GO, ZnS NWs, ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs, and ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites. In the spectrum of GO, the peak at 228 nm is because of the π → π* transition of CC, and the weak peak at about 306 nm corresponds to the n → π* transition of the CO bond.49,50 For pure ZnS NWs, the absorption band edge lies at about 320 nm. In comparison, the absorbance of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs nanocomposites increases and expands to the visible light region because of the absorption contribution of the Cu7S4 components. After the introduction of rGO, ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites exhibit a broad absorption band in the UV-visible light region (300–750 nm), implying that it should have promising photocatalytic performance under sunlight. Fig. 7b presents the photocatalytic activity of ZnS NWs, Cu7S4 NPs, ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs, ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites, which was measured using the degradation of MB under UV light (solid line) and visible light irradiation (dotted line). C0 is the initial concentration of MB and C is the residual concentration of MB at different intervals of illumination. The direct photolysis of MB can be ignored, which was proved using the blank experiment (without photocatalysts). The photocatalytic degradation curves of MB over time with ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites as photocatalyst are given in Fig. 7c. No matter which light source was used, the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites was higher than that of ZnS NWs, Cu7S4 NPs, ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs nanocomposites during the entire photocatalytic degradation process. The degradation kinetics of MB under UV (visible light) irradiation were also investigated by plotting the relationship between ln(C0/C) and irradiation time (Fig. 7c). It can be seen that the curves were linear, fitting well with the first-order rate equation.51 The degradation rate constant, k (min−1) was calculated based on the following equation:ln(C0/C) = kt

The k values for ZnS NWs, Cu7S4 NPs, ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs, ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites under UV (visible light) irradiation were 28.98 × 10−3 min−1 (7.66 × 10−3 min−1), 9.52 × 10−3 min−1 (10.38 × 10−3 min−1), 14.3 × 10−3 min−1 (8.1 × 10−3 min−1), 54.2 × 10−3 min−1 (24.11 × 10−3 min−1), respectively. The ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites possessed the highest degradation rate, which can be explained as follows. Firstly, ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites have the largest surface area, which can provide more activity sites to absorb a large amount of MB molecules, leading to the enhancement of photocatalytic performance.52 Secondly, the heterostructures formed between ZnS NWs and Cu7S4 NPs can help in the separation and transport of the photogenerated electrons and holes under UV and visible light irradiation and avoid charge recombination.53,54 The photostability and reusability of photocatalysts were also important for their practical application. Therefore, the recycling experiments using ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites for the degradation of MB under UV and visible light irradiation were conducted. After each cycle, the sample was washed with deionized water and reused, and the results can be seen in Fig. 7e (UV light) and Fig. 7f (visible light). The photodegradation efficiency exhibits almost no significant loss even though the nanocomposites have been used for five consecutive cycles, which indicated that the as-prepared ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites were sufficiently stable and not deactivated throughout the photocatalytic process.
The electrochemical performances of the as-prepared ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites were investigated using a three electrode system in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte using CV, GCD and EIS measurements. Fig. 8a shows the typical CV curves of a ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposite electrode measured at scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 mV s−1. All the CV curves clearly show the presence of a pair of redox peaks, different from the ideal rectangular CV shape for EDLC, which indicated the pseudo-capacitive characteristic of the ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO electrode.55–59 There was no obvious distortion in the shapes of the CV curves even though the scan rate was as high as 50 mV s−1, indicating the high rate capability and good reversibility of the electrode.60,61 As the scan rate increased, the integrated CV area gradually increased, the anodic peaks moved to a higher potential while the cathodic peaks shifted to the lower potential, because of the limitation of the ion diffusion rate and the internal resistance of the electrode to satisfy the electronic neutralization under faster charge–discharge rates.62,63 The corresponding specific capacitance of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites calculated from the CV curves were 913.5, 599.7, 453.7, 386.4, 355.5, 320.4 F g−1 at scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mV s−1 (Fig. 8c), respectively, suggesting rapid and reversible faradaic behavior and superior rate capability. The specific capacitance, rate capability and cyclic life were further examined using GCD measurements. Fig. 8b shows the GCD curves of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposite electrode measured at the galvanostatic current densities of 1, 2, 5 and 8 A g−1 in the potential window of 0 to 0.5 V. All the curves show a non-linear characteristic and good symmetry with obvious discharge plateaus because of the redox reaction and good reversible behavior, further implying the pseudocapacitive characteristics. The specific capacitances of the ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposite electrode derived from the discharge curves were calculated to be 1114, 677.6, 493.6, 235.2 F g−1 at 1, 2, 5 and 8 A g−1 (Fig. 8d), respectively, which was higher than those of CuxS-based nanocomposites listed in Table 1. The decrease of specific capacitance at high current density was ascribed to the increase in the resistance of the electrode and the inadequate faradaic redox reaction of the active materials.64,65 For use in a practical supercapacitor application, its cycling performance was a significant factor. The capacitance retention of the ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposite electrode is also shown in Fig. 8e. It can be seen that ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposite electrode retained 88% of the initial specific capacitance at 1 A g−1 after 5000 charge–discharge cycles, suggesting a good cycling stability. The inset of Fig. 8e shows the long-term cycling stability of the electrode tested over 5000 continuous cycles at current densities of 1, 2, 5 and 8 A g−1. The electrode retained about 94.0% of its capacitance during the first 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1. In the following 1000 cycles at various current densities, although the current density changed sequentially, the electrode showed stable capacitance, which was maintained at about 92.4% (2 A g−1), 90.3% (5 A g−1) and 88% (8 A g−1) of its initial value, respectively. When the current density turned back to 1 A g−1, the electrode recovered 95.2% of its primary capacitance, and 92.5% of the capacitance was maintained after the last 1000 cycles, revealing the remarkable long-term cycling stability of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites. It is well known that the volume distortion during the redox reaction always results in poor cyclic stability. In this case, the damage of swelling and shrinkage of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs during charge–discharge processes was efficiently prevented with the assistance of rGO sheets,66 which further indicated that the synergistic effect between ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs and rGO would improve the cycle stability.

The EIS analysis was performed to help understand the fundamental electron transfer kinetics, and the corresponding Nyquist plot of the EIS spectrum for the ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO electrode was recorded in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz (Fig. 8f). It can be seen that the Nyquist plot mainly consists of a negligible semicircle at the high-middle frequency region, the diameter of which was related to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) caused by the faradaic reactions at the interface of electrode–electrolyte,67 followed by an inclined line at the low frequency region corresponding to the electrochemical process and mass transfer process,68 the slope of which was the ions’ diffusive resistance (Warburg impedance, Zw). The Rct value was determined to be 0.011 Ω, demonstrating its lower intrinsic resistance and better charge transport behavior.69,70 The large slope also indicated a lower Warburg resistance (Zw = 0.1053) and a faster electron ion diffusion rate at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The EIS results implied that ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites were suitable for use as an electrode material for supercapacitors.
The excellent electrochemical capacitive characteristic of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites can be attributed to its unique hierarchical structure and the synergistic contribution from the different components in it. Firstly, Cu7S4 NPs were directly anchored on the surface of the ZnS NWs, which can not only provide more electrochemical active sites for the redox reaction, but also increased the contact area between the electrolyte and the electrode for the faradaic reaction. Also, the enhanced accessible surface can improve the electronic conductivity, and thus reduce the charge transfer resistance.71,72 Secondly, the rGO layer acts as a conductive matrix to prevent the aggregation of ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs and to improve the conductivity of the nanocomposites, which can provide more conductive channels to facilitate the electron transfer and electrolyte ion diffusion during the charge/discharge process. Thirdly, the excellent electron transportation between ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 and rGO reduced the diffusion resistance, and facilitated the ion and electron transport during the charge–discharge process at high current densities or high scan rates, and therefore enhanced the specific capacitance. All of these results demonstrated the excellent pseudocapacitance features of the ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites as high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials.
To further explore the practical use of the electrode material, an asymmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated based on ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites as the positive electrode and active carbon as the negative electrode in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Fig. 9a shows the CV curves of the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor under various scan rates in the range of 10 to 100 mV s−1 at an operation voltage window of 1.2 V. The shapes of the CV curves were more similar to rectangles without obvious redox peaks, which demonstrated that the supercapacitor was charged and discharged at a pseudo constant rate in entire voltammetric cycles.73 There was no distinct distortion in the shapes until the scan rates increased to 100 mV s−1, indicating the high I–V response and high electron transport rate of the ASC device.74 The capacitance calculated from the CV curve was 207 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1. To find the suitable voltage window for the device, CV curves at different voltage windows were tested as shown in Fig. 9b. Furthermore, when the stable operating voltage window was increased from 1 V to 1.4 V at the scan rate of 50 mV s−1, the shape of the CV curve remained stable without obvious polarization, indicating the excellent charging/discharging capacitive characteristics.75 The wide voltage range was favorable for improving the power and energy density of the cell. Thus, an operation voltage window of 1.2 V was chosen to further study the electrochemical performance of the ASC. Fig. 9c shows the GCD curves measured in the selected voltage window of 1.2 V at different current densities. The discharge curves were almost symmetrical to the corresponding charge curves, indicating the rapid I–V response, sufficient coulombic efficiency and excellent reversibility. The capacitance calculated from the GCD curve was 112 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, indicating the superior rate performance of the device. The asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled from ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites showed a high energy density of 22 W h kg−1 at a power density of 595 W kg−1. The cycling performance of the supercapacitor device was evaluated by repeating the GCD tests for 5000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 9d. It can be seen that the overall specific capacitance of the device still remained at 77% of the initial value. The inset of Fig. 9d shows the 1st and 5000th GCD curves of the supercapacitor. After 5000 cycles, the shape of the GCD curves remains same, suggesting that the fabricated ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites could undergo a long-term cycling test and maintain a steady electrochemical performance. The decrease in capacitance after cycling may be because of the degradation or detachment of active material during cycling and loss of electric contact between the constituent composite materials.76 It is worth noting, that the cycling stability of a asymmetric supercapacitor was worse than that of a three-electrode system (88% retention after 5000 cycles), which might because of the consumption of solid-state electrolyte during the electrochemical reaction.15,77

4. Conclusions
In summary, a novel ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposite was successfully prepared using a one-step hydrothermal method for supercapacitor and photocatalytic applications. The ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1114 F g−1, excellent cycling stability (88% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles) and low charge transfer resistance of 0.011 Ω. The asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled from ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites showed a high energy density of 22 W h kg−1 at a power density of 595 W kg−1. Furthermore, ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites degraded MB dye completely within 1 h (2 h) under UV light (visible light) irradiation. Therefore, the novel ZnS NWs/Cu7S4 NPs/rGO nanocomposites developed in the present investigation can be used as a superior electrode for supercapacitor and photocatalytic applications.
