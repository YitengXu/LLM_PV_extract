    , Accepted 29th April 2023First published on 2nd May 2023AbstractAdvances in the development of kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells are urgently needed to further exploit their high-efficiency and low-cost nature. However, almost all the CZTSSe photovoltaics are presently fabricated using physically sputter-deposited i-ZnO as a window layer, which often results in self-doping with detrimental oxygen vacancies (VO) and zinc interstitial (Zni) defects, leading to ineffective charge collection and enlarged interface recombination losses. Herein, a solution-processed ZnO:Li nanoparticle (NP) window layer is demonstrated via the construction of a high-quality ZnO:Li/CdS/CZTSSe heterojunction to enhance the charge collection and minimize the interface recombination. The interstitial Li doping at a certain content significantly enhances the electrical conductivity of ZnO and quasi-Fermi level splitting at the p–n junction interface and reduces the concentration of VO and Zni defects. These electric benefits finally improve the conversion efficiency from 11.31% up to 12.60% with significant gains in FF and Voc. Our findings suggest that developing a ZnO:Li NP window layer is an effective method to manage electrical conductivity, contact resistance and interface band offset at the p–n junction, boosting the development of high-efficiency and low-cost kesterite solar cells to a higher level.
1 Introduction
Environmentally friendly kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin-film solar cells have attracted worldwide attention as one of the leading photovoltaic technologies due to their earth-abundant constituents, long-term tolerance stability and superior photovoltaic performance.1–6 Considerable research efforts have been recently devoted to interface engineering,7–11 defect passivation12–14 and crystallization control,15–18 and several groups reported the latest achieved power conversion efficiency (PCE) beyond 13.0%.19,20 Although the solution-processed absorber offers advantages in elemental composition control at the molecular level and lowering the production cost, the challenge now is to continue this progress in the efficiency improvement, and its open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) are much inferior to those of other leading PV technologies. Due to the smaller formation energy near the surface absorber, the native disordered surface defects produce a high density of recombination centers.21 After contact with an n-type CdS buffer layer, the concentrated p-type CuZn and VCu acceptors at the surface absorber result in insufficient p-to-n conversion, which could further degrade electron extraction at the CdS/CZTSSe interface.22 It is believed that both of the above-mentioned intrinsic limitations at the front contact lead to large interface recombination loss, thus limiting the device performance.23 Advances rely on controlling the charge extraction and collection that make up the high-quality ZnO/CdS/CZTSSe heterojunction interface with enhanced electrical properties.
Till now, efforts on this interface issue are mainly addressed on the p-type absorber side, such as developing an element epitaxial interface to depress the disordered surface defects20,24,25 and graded absorbers with a down-shifted valence band to enlarge the energy band bending and facilitate p-to-n conversion at the p–n junction.26–28 All of these approaches have been proven to be effective, but most of them still encountered a technical obstacle to reconstitute an interface micro-region structure under the effect of continuous element diffusion. In fact, the widely adopted intrinsic ZnO (i-ZnO) window layer also has significant influences on the overall performance.29,30 As an important part of the ZnO/CdS/CZTSSe p–n junction, it not only undertakes the role of electron transport/collection, but also combines with the CdS buffer layer to limit the Voc loss through the electronic isolation of leakage shunts. Additionally, it can be expected that a well-tuned Fermi level and carrier concentration on the n-type ZnO side also contribute greatly towards the electric field and charge extraction at the p–n junction, which will further depress interface recombination losses. However, for physically sputter-deposited i-ZnO, this material often accounts for nonstoichiometry in an oxygen-poor atmosphere, which will result in self-doping via intrinsic defects such as oxygen vacancies (VO) and zinc interstitials (Zni).31,32 These dominant defects in ZnO mainly affect the electrical properties and can delay the electron transport process and cause unnecessary carrier recombination before achieving the collection electrode.33 It is difficult to control self-doping with good reliability and the implementation of extrinsic element doping also encounters technical obstacles due to the disparity of the element sputter rate. Therefore, further controlling the defect states within the ZnO window layer in an oxygen-rich atmosphere is of paramount importance for the realization of high-quality ZnO/CdS/CZTSSe heterojunctions.
To overcome the shortcoming issues of conventional sputtered i-ZnO, herein we present the extrinsic Li doping of solution-processed ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) as the window layer to improve the electrical properties of the ZnO/CdS/CZTSSe heterojunction interface. In comparison to the vacuum-based technique, it can accurately control the Li doping content and further reduce the power consumption. Our results show that lithium cations with a smaller ionic radius mainly enter the interstitial sites of the host ZnO lattice, thus reducing the concentration of VO and Zni defects. The electron doping of Lii remarkably improves the electrical conductivity of ZnO and enhances Fermi level splitting at the ZnO/CdS/CZTSSe heterojunction interface. The accelerated electron transport process lowers the series resistance and inhibits interface recombination losses, leading to significant gains in FF and Voc. As a result, the ZnO:Li improves the PCE from 11.31% up to 12.60%, which is nearly 11.6% higher than that of the device using sputter-deposited i-ZnO (11.28%). Our findings indicate that the difficulties faced by sputter-deposited i-ZnO are well addressed here including defect controlling and more facile Li doping.

Thiourea (NH2CSNH2, 99.9%) and ethyl acetate (C4H8O2, 99.5%) were obtained from Alfa Aesar company.
2.2 Synthesis of ZnO and ZnO:Li NPs
For the synthesis of ZnO NPs, a zinc acetate solution was first prepared by adding 0.5 M (0.5488 g) zinc acetate and 5 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) into a 35 mL sample bottle. The solution was kept under stirring at 600 rpm for 15 min at room temperature until the reagents were completely dissolved. Meanwhile, a tetramethylformamide (TMAH) solution was prepared by adding 0.55 M (0.4985 g) TMAH and 5 mL anhydrous ethanol in another sample bottle, and this was also kept under stirring at 600 rpm for 15 min at room temperature until the reagents were completely dissolved. Then, the clarified TMAH anhydrous ethanol solution was injected into the zinc acetate DMSO solution and the mixture was kept under stirring at 600 rpm for 1 hour at room temperature to get a transparent solution. After that, 12 mL precipitant of ethyl acetate was injected into the sample bottle and the mixed solution was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 6 min to obtain ZnO NPs. Finally, the obtained white product was all used and dispersed in 12 mL anhydrous ethanol to obtain a ZnO NP solution and this concentration was denoted as CZnO. Additionally, this synthesis process was repeated for two times and the products were dispersed in 6 mL and 24 mL anhydrous ethanol respectively. The concentrations of these ZnO NP solutions were denoted as 0.5CZnO and 2CZnO. All these three ZnO NP concentrations were used to deposit different thicknesses of ZnO films.
For the synthesis of ZnO:Li NPs, different amounts of lithium acetate with the atom percent of 1%, 2% and 5% were added into the 0.5 M zinc acetate DMSO solution (5 mL). After that, the other operation procedures were consistent with the preparation of ZnO NPs. Finally, the obtained ZnO:Li NPs were dispersed in 12 mL anhydrous ethanol and directly used for the deposition of the ZnO:Li NP window layer.
2.3 Device fabrication
A 800 nm molybdenum substrate was prepared by two-step sputtering on soda-lime glass. The power, gas flow and sputtering time of the first step were 100 W, 7 mTorr and 32 min. In addition, the condition for the second step was 170 W, 3 mTorr and 35 min. For the preparation of CZTSSe absorber, 3.60 mmol Zn(C2H3O2)2 (0.7902 g), 4.84 mmol CuCl (0.4792 g), 3.06 mmol SnCl4 (1.0728 g), 0.0239 mol thiourea (1.8223 g) and 0.202 mmol AgCl (0.029 g) were first added into a 20 mL sample bottle containing 10 mL ethylene glycol monomethyl ether. The mixture was kept under stirring in air for 2 hours until the solution turned transparent primrose yellow. Next, the prepared precursor solution was spin-coated onto a molybdenum substrate and then heated on a hot plate at 280 °C for 2 min. This procedure was repeated for 11 times until the thickness of the precursor film reached 1.8 μm and all these operations were performed in a fume cupboard. After that, the precursor films were placed in a graphite box containing selenium particles for high-temperature selenization. This procedure was performed in a rapid-heating furnace and the selenization condition is 550 °C, 900 s. Then, a 50 nm CdS buffer layer was deposited on top of the large-grained absorber by a chemical water bath deposition (CBD) method. Specifically, the reaction solution was prepared by orderly adding 0.0768 g cadmium sulfate, 12.5 mL ammonia water and 0.1100 g thiourea into a beaker containing 250 mL deionized water with a time interval of 5 min. During the CBD process, the absorbers were vertically positioned within the beaker and the beaker was placed in a water bath kettle. The deposition condition is 65 °C, 350 rpm and 8 min. Next, the ZnO or ZnO:Li solutions were spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s on top of the CdS buffer layer. The ZnO/CdS/CZTSSe stacks were then thermally annealed at 125, 145, 165 and 185 °C for 30 min in an atmospheric atmosphere respectively to determine the optimal ZnO treatment condition. Finally, 120 nm ITO (80 W, 2 mTorr and 60 min) and 70 nm Ag grid were sputtered on top in sequence. The active area of the device is 0.21 cm2.
2.4 Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100) was performed to obtain the morphology and lattice fringe of zinc oxide. The surface and cross section morphologies of CZTSSe solar cells were obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-7900F, AZtecLIVE UltimMax 40). The morphology of ZnO/CdS/CZTSSe stacks was collected by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), and the potential images were obtained at 0.5 V bias. The crystal structure of the samples was characterized by XRD using a Bruker 8D Advance instrument. The resistivity was analyzed by Hall-effect measurements (Swin/HALL8800). To accomplish the Hall measurements, the solution-processed ZnO films were deposited for three layers (with a thickness of ∼70 nm) on the glass substrate. Elemental analysis was conducted using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, TY 2021011786). The EQE is measured in the range of 300 to 1400 nm using a Zolix SCS100QE instrument. PL was measured using a steady-state fluorescence spectrometer (FLS1000) instrument with an excitation light source at 325 nm. UPS was performed using an ESCALAB 250Xi instrument to estimate the relevant energy levels of zinc oxide. The transmittance spectra of the ZnO film were recorded using a UV-visible near-infrared spectrophotometer (UV, PE Lambda 950). The electron beam–induced current (EBIC) was determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy with an electron beam voltage of 20 kV. The temperature-dependent I–V curves were obtained using a deep-level transient spectrum instrument. The minority carrier lifetime was obtained by transient photovoltage (TPV, Tektronix TDS3054C). A solar simulator with a 150 W xenon lamp was used to test the device efficiency.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 ZnO:Li NP doping mechanism and device performance
As for the replacement of sputter-deposited i-ZnO by solution-processed ZnO NPs, the new type of window layer used for efficient and stable kesterite solar cells should meet issues such as satisfied bandgaps for transparency, proper band alignment with the CdS buffer layer and CZTSSe absorbers for efficient charge extraction, enhanced conductivity for electron transport and closely stacked and pinhole-free morphology to enable optimum contact. Fig. 1a shows the actual location of Li after entering the host ZnO lattice. Based on theoretical results, we can infer that Lii is the dominant defect with a smaller formation energy than other inherent and extrinsic defects.34–36 When Li+ enters the interstitial sites to replace Zni, some VO sites are also occupied by Li+ due to the charge compensation effect.35,37 That is to say, the Li doping could create Lii donors and simultaneously reduce the VO and Zni defects. According to the formula,Li = Lii+ + e−

Li intercalation could induce electron doping and increase the carrier concentration within ZnO, thus improve its electrical conductivity.38–40

Fig. 1b gives the cross-sectional SEM image of the full solar cell stack. It can be observed that every functional layer is closely packed to prevent the formation of shunting channels and ensure the performance reproducibility. To determine the optimal preparation condition of the solution-processed ZnO layer, the effects of ZnO NP concentration (0.5CZnO, CZnO and 2CZnO) and annealing temperature (125, 145, 165 and 185 °C) on device performance were first confirmed. As shown in Fig. S1 and S2,† the optimal ZnO NP solution concentration is CZnO and the annealing temperature is 165 °C. Under this condition, the ZnO NP device achieves the highest efficiency of 11.31%, which is comparable to the sputter-deposited i-ZnO device with an efficiency of 11.28%. Fig. S3† illustrates the SEM morphology and EDS element mappings of the i-ZnO/CdS/CZTSSe stack and ZnO NPs/CdS/CZTSSe stack, which can give a piece of direct evidence to evaluate the uniformity of the solution-processed ZnO NP window layer. It can be observed that the distribution of Zn and O elements is similar for both samples and no aggregation is presented, indicating the uniform coverage of ZnO NP films on the CdS/CZTSSe stack. After that, different Li doping contents of 0%, 1%, 2% and 5% (molar ratio to Zn atoms) were used. The J–V curves and the statistical distribution of performance parameters are presented in Fig. 1c and d. It can be found that Jsc and FF are monotonically increased with the increase in Li doping content until 2%, accompanied by a slight enhancement in Voc. All the three parameters achieve the highest value at 2% Li content, making the efficiency of the device increase from 11.31% up to 12.60%. The decreased PCE of the 5% ZnO:Li device indicates that an excess Li content is detrimental to cell performance. At a high dopant concentration, too many Li interstitials would dramatically enhance the n-type conductivity of ZnO, which is contradictory to the ability of serving as an electronic isolation layer for leakage shunts. The variation in the conductivity of sputtered i-ZnO, ZnO NPs and ZnO:Li films was further identified by the Hall-effect measurement, as shown in Fig. S4.† The resistivities (ρ) of all the solution-processed ZnO NP samples are decreased in comparison to sputtered i-ZnO and ρ is monotonously reduced with the increase in Li content, denoting an enhanced electron transport within the ZnO window layer after Li doping. The poor performance demonstrates that a well-controlled conductivity of ZnO at a proper Li doping concentration is necessary. In Fig. S5,† the series resistance (Rs) gets smaller and the shunt resistance (Rsh) gets larger for the 2% ZnO:Li device, demonstrating an improved charge transport within the ZnO window layer and an inhibited interface recombination process at the p–n junction. Fig. S6† compares the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the CZTSSe solar cells using the ZnO NP layer before and after Li doping, which indicates that the improvement in integral current density is consistent with that derived from J–V curves. The EQE enhancement (ΔEQE in Fig. S6b†) mainly occurs within the short wavelength range before 750 nm, indicating that the charge collection process is obviously improved within the depletion region due to the improved electron transport on the n-type ZnO/CdS side. Furthermore, the efficiency stability of the champion CZTSSe solar cells with ZnO:Li NP window layers is presented in Fig. S7.† After the storage in the indoor air environment for 60 days, the efficiency is decreased from 12.60% to 11.19% and this trend is similar to the reported stability in our previous work using a sputtered i-ZnO window layer.
3.2 Structural and electrical properties of ZnO:Li NPs
To further identify the influence of Li interstitial dopants on structural properties, high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HR-TEM) images of the morphological evolution of the synthesized ZnO NPs before and after 2% Li doping are presented in Fig. 2a–f. It can be observed that both the ZnO samples are uniform-sized and well-dispersed with a particle size of around 5 nm.41,42 After a small amount of Li ions enter into the host lattice, the interplanar spacing is slightly increased from 0.284 nm and 0.289 nm. To some extent, this crystallite dimension of the ZnO host lattice further confirms the extrinsic Li interstitial doping mechanism. However, if the intercalation of Li+ into ZnO is in the manner of substitutional doping, its smaller ionic radius (0.060 nm) than that of Zn2+ (0.074 nm) would reduce the ZnO crystallite dimension.34,35,40,43 Besides, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of ZnO NP films before and after 2% Li doping are presented in Fig. S8,† wherein the characteristic peaks are assigned to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103) and (112) lattice planes of the wurtzite phase. For the main peak (002) plane, the lattice parameters of pristine ZnO and ZnO:Li NPs were evaluated to be a = b = 3.4216, c = 5.4547 and a = b = 3.4340, c = 5.4830, respectively, which is consistent with the lattice expansion result in TEM morphology.

(d) TEM morphology, (e) Fourier and (f) inverse Fourier transform plane spacing of ZnO NPs after Li doping. (g) XPS Zn2p peak, (h) XPS O1s peak and (i) EPR of ZnO NPs before and after Li doping. 
Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to identify the evolution of element valence state after doping with 2% Li. In Fig. S9,† an obvious fluctuation of Li1s peak at around 55 eV appears for the ZnO:Li NPs, indicating the intercalation of Li into the ZnO host lattice. In Fig. 2g, the binding energy of Zn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 is 1021.7 eV and 1044.8 eV for the pristine ZnO NPs and 1021.3 eV and 1044.4 eV for the ZnO:Li NPs, respectively. This slight shift toward the low binding energy direction indicates that Li interstitial doping changes the chemical environment of Zn and would affect deep-level Zni defects and Zn–O bonding. Meanwhile, the deconvoluted Gaussian sub-peaks of O1s spectra are also presented in Fig. 2h, wherein the main peak and shoulder peak denote O1s A and O1s B, respectively. Generally, the O1s A peak with a lower binding energy at around 530.5 eV is associated with the oxygen atom and the O1s B peak at around 532.0 eV is attributable to oxygen vacancies.44,45 After the incorporation of Li interstitial defects, the O1s A peak is shifted from 530.1 eV to 530.5 eV and the O1s B peak is shifted from 531.6 eV to 532.0 eV, indicating the change in the oxygen chemical environment. The calculated area ratio of O1sB:O1sA for pristine ZnO NPs (0.97) is larger than that of ZnO:Li NPs (0.92), demonstrating the reduction in oxygen vacancies after Li doping.35 This result is also confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis, wherein the Lande g factor represents the total angular momentum of the unpaired electrons. The comparison of the EPR of sputtered i-ZnO and solution-processed ZnO NPs films was first provided in Fig. S10.† It can be observed that the intensity of VO (g = 2.003) is slightly decreased for the solution-processed ZnO NP film, indicating that the concentration of VO defects is reduced under the oxygen-rich air environment. Moreover, the intensity of VO is more evidently decreased after Li doping, as shown in Fig. 2i, demonstrating that Lii plays a dominant role in the suppression of VO defects.
In the next, the transmittance, energy-level and defect properties of the solution-processed ZnO NPs before and after Li doping were systematically investigated. To make sure that the thickness of i-ZnO, ZnO NP and ZnO:Li NP films is similar, Fig. S11† first identifies the thickness of different layers of spin-coated ZnO NP films. From the SEM cross-sectional morphologies, it can be observed that the thickness of two layers of ZnO NP films (49 nm) is similar to that of the i-ZnO film (54 nm), and the following measurements are all based on this thickness. Fig. S12† compares the transmittance spectra of sputtered ZnO, pristine ZnO NPs and ZnO:Li NPs with 2% content. It can be observed that the transmittance of all the solution-processed ZnO and ZnO:Li NP samples is above 90% in the wavelength range from 400 to 1000 nm. However, the transmittance of sputtered ZnO is markedly lower than that of the solution-processed samples, suggesting that the ZnO NPs films have a micro-pore structure and thus increase the transmittance. Benefiting from this high optical transparency and defectless layer, the pristine ZnO NP device achieves higher Jsc than that of the sputter ZnO device. However, in Fig. S1a,† we also noticed Voc is slightly decreased for the pristine ZnO NP device (Voc = 0.453 V, Jsc = 37.86 mA cm−2, FF = 65.88%, PCE = 11.31%), which finally results in a similar PCE to the sputter ZnO device (Voc = 0.465 V, Jsc = 36.89 mA cm−2, FF = 65.64%, PCE = 11.28%). This result indicates that the solution-processed pristine ZnO NPs may have some shortages that limit their performance. For a direct spin-coated ZnO NP layer, its interface contact with CdS is not as good as the sputter ZnO with high energy sputtering and may have some microvoids. As shown in the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS, Fig. S13†),46 the recombination resistance Rct gets smaller in the pristine ZnO NP device in comparison to the sputter ZnO device. Thus, further improving the electric properties of ZnO NPs via Li doping is necessary. After 2% Li doping, the deduced band gap of ZnO:Li NPs is increased from 3.60 eV to 3.75 eV, as shown in Fig. 3a. The broadened optical band gap of ZnO:Li NPs should be ascribed to the Burstein-Moss phenomena.44,47 In the ZnO matrix, the excess donors created by Li interstitial doping cause the widening of its optical band gap. The conduction band minimum (CBM), Fermi level (EF) and valence band maximum (VBM) of the pristine ZnO NP and ZnO:Li NP films were further evaluated by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). In Fig. 3b, the difference between EF and VBM is 2.97 and 3.18 eV for pristine ZnO NPs and ZnO:Li NPs, respectively. Besides, in Fig. 3c, the work function of pristine ZnO NPs and ZnO:Li NPs was estimated to be 4.72 eV (21.2 eV − 16.48 eV) and 4.59 eV (21.2 eV − 16.61 eV), respectively. Based on the above-mentioned parameters, the specific energy levels of ZnO NPs before and after Li doping are illustrated in Fig. 3d. It can be found that the actual Fermi level is upshifted toward CBM for the ZnO:Li NP window layer due to the increase in donor concentration, which will enhance the built-in field and Fermi level splitting after contact with the CdS/CZTSSe stack, thereby contributing a higher Voc.45

Additionally, we also investigated the defect property of the ZnO:Li NP window layer by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurement. As shown in Fig. S14,† both of the pristine ZnO and ZnO:Li NPs present an obvious defect emission peak at around 530 nm, primarily arising from Zni or VO. The decrease in the relative intensity of visible emission after Li doping indicates reduced deep level defects of zinc interstitials or oxygen vacancies in ZnO.36,48 Meanwhile, based on this technology, the PL mapping of pristine ZnO/CdS/CZTSSe and ZnO:Li/CdS/CZTSSe stacks are illustrated in Fig. 3e and f to identify the charge extraction behavior on a micron scale. For the ZnO:Li/CdS/CZTSSe stack, the phase distribution is relatively uniform and an obvious PL quench is observed, indicating that the charge extraction of the heterojunction is improved, which is ascribed to the accelerated free electron transport within the ZnO layer and an enhanced interfacial electric field.
3.3 Electrical property enhancement of the p–n junction
It can be expected that the above-discussed Fermi level and conductivity tailoring of the ZnO:Li NP window layer could assist a good selective contact at the ZnO NPs/CdS/CZTSSe heterojunction, and greatly affect the interface carrier dynamics and device performance. Fig. 4 summarizes the enhanced p–n junction electrical properties, including quasi-Fermi-level splitting, depletion region width (Wd) and carrier collection. After depositing ZnO and ZnO:Li NPs on the CdS/CZTSSe stack, the top two-dimensional images of Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) displayed in Fig. S15† indicate that their surface morphology and roughness are nearly unchanged. Due to the electron doping of the ZnO:Li NP window layer, in Fig. 4a and b, the contact potential difference (CPD) exhibits an obvious enhancement for the ZnO:Li NPs/CdS/CZTSSe stack and the average CPD is increased from −168 mV (with pristine ZnO NPs) to 198 mV. As shown in Fig. 4d and e, the higher Fermi-level of n-type ZnO:Li results in larger quasi-Fermi-level splitting and band bending at the p–n junction due to the band flattening effect.49 Regarding the increase in Voc from 0.453 to 0.472 V, we can estimate that such band bending enables about 19 mV enhancement in Voc.

Besides, based on eqn (1), the increase in electron concentration on the n-type side will deliver wider Wd on the p-type side of the p–n junction. The specific Wd value and carrier concentration (NC–V) on the CZTSSe absorber side can be calculated from the capacitance–voltage (C–V) curves (Fig. 4f), according to eqn (2): (1) (2)wherein ND, NA, Vbi, and A are the donor concentration of n-type materials, acceptor concentration of p-type materials, built-in potential, and effective area of the device, respectively. In Fig. 4g, the ZnO:Li window layer results in an increase in the depletion region width from 0.26 to 0.32 μm on the CZTSSe absorber side. This enhanced interface electric field assists more effective carrier extraction and accelerates the transport of space charge from the p-type side near the p–n junction to the CdS buffer layer,28 thus inducing a decrease in the carrier concentration from 6.71 × 1016 to 5.53 × 1016 cm−3. The visual electron beam–induced current (EBIC) results of the CZTSSe solar cells using pristine ZnO NP and ZnO:Li NP window layers are presented in Fig. 4h and i, and their cross-section morphologies are also provided in Fig. S16.† It can be clearly observed that the ZnO:Li device demonstrates a brighter and wider collected current intensity on both sides of the p–n junction. The enhancement of carrier collection ability would promote the enhancement of FF and Jsc.
3.4 Interface recombination evolution
The ZnO:Li NP window layer assisted energetics at the above-discussed ZnO:Li/CdS/CZTSSe heterojunction can not only facilitate charge collection but also minimize interface recombination losses. Fig. 5a and b present the temperature-dependent current density–voltage (J–V–T) curves of CZTSSe solar cells using pristine ZnO NP and ZnO:Li NP window layers from 100 to 350 K. In Fig. S17,† the ZnO:Li device shows better diode characteristics than those of the pristine ZnO NPs device, especially at low temperatures, suggesting the inhibited leakage current within the device. Fig. 5c shows the activation energy (Ea) of carrier recombination derived from J–V–T curves according to eqn (3), (3)wherein K, A, J0 and J00 stand for the Boltzmann constant, ideal factor, pre-factor depending on the recombination path and reverse saturation current density, respectively. The Ea value of the ZnO device is 0.7092 eV, which is much smaller than the estimated Eg value of CZTSSe from EQE (1.06 eV), indicating that the dominant energy loss path is interface recombination involving lower Voc. While for the ZnO:Li device, the Ea value of 0.8848 eV gets closer to the Eg value of CZTSSe, suggesting that the interface recombination loss is significantly depressed.
 Fig. 5  Temperature-dependent current density–voltage characteristic curves ranging from 100 to 350 K for CZTSSe solar cells using ZnO NP window layers (a) before and (b) after doping with 2% Li. All the measurements were performed under dark conditions. (c) Aln(J0) vs. 1/KT plot and (d) transient photovoltage decay for CZTSSe solar cells using ZnO NP window layers before and after doping with 2% Li. 
As a result, in Fig. 5d, the non-equilibrium carriers of transient photovoltage decay slower for the ZnO:Li device and the minority carrier lifetime is prolonged from 56 to 124 μs.
4 Conclusions
In summary, we used solution-processed ZnO:Li NPs as window layers to replace conventional sputtered i-ZnO for CZTSSe solar cells, and their electric benefits in structuring the charge-extraction p–n junction interface were comprehensively investigated. It turned out that the insertion of Li into the host ZnO lattice was dominated by interstitial doping and the occupancy sites were VO and Zni. Due to the electron doping characteristics, the introduced Lii increases the carrier concentration and Fermi level and decreases deep-level defects. These electric benefits effectively enhanced the quasi-Fermi level at the ZnO:Li/CdS/CZTSSe heterojunction and broaden the depletion region width on the p-type absorber side, thereby accelerating the carrier transport process within ZnO and the charge extraction process at the p–n junction and depress the charge recombination process at this interface. As a result, the ZnO:Li NP window layer contributes significant gains to FF and Voc and improves the PCE up to 12.60%. These findings prove that the ZnO:Li NP window layer is an ideal alternative to sputtered i-ZnO, which lowers the manufacture cost of CZTSSe solar cells and offers the potential for future applications in flexible photovoltaics.
