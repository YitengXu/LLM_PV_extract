, Accepted 20th October 2016First published on 20th October 2016AbstractA water-soluble small-molecule perylene diimide derivative functionalized with a propylenetrimethylammonium end group, namely N,N-bis(propylenetrimethyl ammonium)-3,4,9,10-perylenediimide (PDI-N3I), was synthesized and successfully applied to conventional polymer solar cells as the cathode interlayer firstly. The small-molecule PDI-N3I showed excellent solubility in water and a desirable LUMO energy level of −4.09 eV which matches well with that of PC71BM. With incorporation of the PDI-N3I cathode interlayer, a PDI-N3I/Al device exhibited a higher PCE of 7.00% than that (6.54%) of a LiF/Al device resulting from the improved short current density from 10.41 mA cm−2 to 11.44 mA cm−2, which benefitted from the more efficient electron extracting ability of PDI-N3I compared with LiF proved by photoluminescence quenching experiment. The high vertical conductivity of PDI-N3I endows it with the outstanding property of thickness insensitivity, which is compatible with roll-to-roll production. Additionally, device performance was further improved by the use of a PDI-N3I/LiF bilayered cathode interlayer and the highest PCE of 7.18% was achieved. This work provides a novel solution-processed cathode interlayer material which could effectively improve the efficiency of polymer solar cells.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs), which have been regarded as a promising way of converting clean renewable solar energy to electricity, have drawn great attention in scientific and industrial communities during the past few years due to their unique advantages of low cost, flexibility, light weight and compatibility with large-scale fabrication technologies.1–3 Combined advances in donor/acceptor materials design, interlayer manipulation between active layer and electrodes, device engineering as well as morphology control have afforded extremely enhanced power conversion efficiencies (PCE).4–15 Up to now, devices based on binary bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends of polymer donors and PCBM acceptors have given truly remarkable PCEs of over 10% and 11% for single- and tandem-junction cells according to the literature, respectively.16–18
Numerous research results suggest that the interfacial modification layer plays a critical role in achieving highly efficient PSCs, which serves multiple unique functions, such as tuning the energy level alignment at the active layer/electrodes interface, improving charge selectivity of electrodes, optimizing the morphology of the active layer, modulating light absorption in the active layer and improving the device stability.19–21 So far, abundant works have focused on carefully optimizing interfacial layers to provide high device performance. Among those investigations, LiF or Ca is the most widely employed and promising material for cathode interlayer in conventional PSCs, which gives great enhancement in PCE compared with that of device without cathode interlayer.22,23 However, the LiF or Ca interlayer needs the expensive and complicated vacuum evaporation technique, which is incompatible with large-scale production technologies.24–26 In recent years, a lot of novel solution-processed cathode interlayers which possess the advantages of low cost, vacuum free and easy process have been successfully applied to PSCs and many of them even exhibit better performance than LiF or Ca. One kind of novel solution-processed cathode interlayer is transition metal oxides and chelates, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), tin oxide (SnOx), cerium oxide (CeOx) and titanium (diisopropoxide)bis(2,4-pentanedionate) (TIPD).27–33 However, most of them need high temperature treatment technique to realize their practical application, which limits their compatibility with the easy processing and flexible substrates for PSCs. Another kind of novel solution-processed cathode interlayer is polymer-based organic interlayer, for instance, poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) and its derivatives, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), which have exhibited outstanding properties in achieving highly efficient PSCs.8,34–36 However, the unavoidable characteristics of complicated synthetic process and bad batch-to-batch reproducibility for polymer restrict its application. Compared with the polymer-based cathode interlayer material, solution-processed small molecule has several specific advantages, such as simple synthesis and purification methods, precise molecular weight and well defined structures, no end groups contaminants and better batch-to-batch reproducibility.37–39 Recently, perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives as interfacial materials have attracted great attention because of its easy functionalization, high electron affinities and high conductivity.40–44 Despite the reported PDIN as cathode interlayer could effectively enhance the device efficiency,44 PDIN suffers from bad film formation due to its low solubility. In addition, PDIN still maintains low solubility in weak polar solvent, such as chlorobenzene, which will bring a negative impact on inverted device performance resulting from the combination of active layer and cathode interlayer at interface. Therefore, developing novel perylene diimide derivative for interfacial materials with high solubility, good film formation and easy synthesis is still a huge challenge.
In this work, a small molecule based on PDI, named PDI-N3I, was synthesized by simply reacting PDIN with methyl iodide. The introduction of iodine anion in terminal substituent of PDI-N3I provides high solubility in water, while maintaining its intrinsic properties of high electron affinities and conductivity. Additionally, the large interfacial dipole of ionized side chain is beneficial for the modification of the interfacial energy level. Remarkably, after inserting of PDI-N3I as the cathode layer, the conventional device based on poly[N-(2-hexyldodecyl)-2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-dicarboximide-alt-5,5-(2,5-bis(3-decyl-thiophen-2-yl)-thiophene)] (PBTI3T)45 and (6,6)-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) exhibited higher PCE than that of LiF device. Furthermore, a PCE of 7.18% was achieved by incorporation of bilayered PDI-N3I/LiF as cathode interlayer.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and characterization
PBTI3T was synthesized in our laboratory according to the reported procedure.45 3,4,9,10-Perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA, 98%) and 3-dimethylaminopropylamine (99%) were purchased from Aladdin company. Chlorobenzene (CB, 99+%, pure) was bought from Acros Organics. PC71BM was acquired from American Dye Source Inc. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. All reagents were used as received without any further purification unless otherwise stated.
Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) was recorded on a VG ESCALAB MK II X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy instrument. UV-Vis absorption spectra were performed on a Lambda 750 spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer). NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AV spectrometer with chloroform-d (CDCl3) and dimethyl-d6 sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) as the solvent. The MALDI-TOF characterization was obtained on a Bruker autoflex III high-performance MALDI-TOF & TOF/TOF system. The photoluminescence quenching experiment was carried out on an assembled Edinburgh Fluorescence Spectrometer.
The conventional PSCs were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/cathode interlayer (CIL)/Al. The ITO-covered glass substrates were cleaned sequentially with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol by ultrasonic treatment followed by an UV–ozone treatment for 25 min. Then the PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated onto pre-treated ITO substrates at 3000 rpm from a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Clevious PVP AI 4083) and annealed at 150 °C for 20 min in air, after which the substrates were transferred into a N2 filled glove box to continue the rest operation. The PBTI3T:PC71BM mixed solution was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer from a CB solution containing 8 mg ml−1 PBTI3T and 8 mg ml−1 PC71BM with a 2% volume ratio of DIO. Then the PDI-N3I layers were spin-coated onto the active layer from a solution of water/isopropanol (1/4, volume/volume) with a variety of concentrations (from 0.2 mg ml−1 to 2 mg ml−1) at 2000 rpm. The mixed solution was obtained by dissolving PDI-N3I in water (from 1 mg ml−1 to 10 mg ml−1) firstly and then diluting the water solution by adding four-time isopropanol in volume. At last, a 0.8 nm LiF layer and 120 nm Al cathode or 120 nm Al cathode only was deposited by evaporation onto the organic layer at a pressure of lower than 5.0 × 10−4 Pa using the equipment purchased from Beijing Beiyi Innovation Vacuum Technology Co., Ltd (DM-300B). The active area of the device was 3 × 3 mm2. Current–voltage characteristics of the device were recorded by Keithley-2400 source meter in a N2 filled glove box using a solar simulator (SAN-EI (Japan), XES-70S1 (AAA Class Standard)) (AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mA cm−2). According to Lambert's law, the thickness of PDI-N3I films was calculated by combining the profilometer data with the UV-Vis absorption intensity of PDI-N3I films.
2.2 Synthesis of PDI-N3I
Synthesis of PDI-N3. PTCDA (2.00 g, 4.84 mmol) and 3-dimethylaminopropylamine (3 ml, 70.8 mmol) were dissolved in 50 ml of pyridine. The resultant solution was kept at 135 °C for 24 h with stirring under argon. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into 100 ml methanol under stirring for 30 min, and then placed in refrigerator overnight. The crude product was filtered, and washed with methanol and diethyl ether. The obtained residue was subjected to 150 ml 5% NaOH aqueous solution at 90 °C for 60 min to remove the unreacted PTCDA. The suspended mixture was suction filtrated, washed with methanol and diethyl ether and dried under vacuum to give the intermediate product, PDI-N3, as red solid (2.56 g, 90%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) δ: 8.68 (4H, d), 8.60 (4H, d), 4.27 (4H, t), 2.47 (4H, m), 2.28 (12H, s), 1.98 (4H, m).

Synthesis of PDI-N3I. The red solid of PDI-N3 (2.56 g, 4.57 mmol) and methyl iodide (12.8 ml, 205 mmol) were dissolved in 130 ml of toluene, and then the reaction mixture stirred for 12 h at 100 °C under argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was suction filtrated after cooling to room temperature and then washed with toluene and dried under vacuum to give a crude product. Then, the crude product was subjected to Soxhlet extraction with chloroform. The residual was obtained and dried under vacuum to afford a brown-red solid as product, PDI-N3I, (3.2 g, 81%). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz) δ: 8.55 (4H, d), 8.33 (4H, d), 4.16 (4H, t), 3.48 (4H, m), 3.09 (18H, s), 2.19 (4H, m). 13C NMR (DMSO-d6, 100 MHz, 80 °C): δ (ppm) = 163.1, 134.7, 131.0, 128.9, 126.1, 124.0, 122.9, 64.3, 53.2, 37.4, 22.1.

3. Results and discussion
The synthetic route of PDI-N3I was shown in Fig. 1a. The final product PDI-N3I was achieved by simple two steps reaction from commercially available compounds, PTCDA and 3-dimethylaminopropylamine, with relatively high yield (>70%). PDI-N3I is insoluble in chlorinated solvents such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene and chloroform, but is readily soluble in high polar solvents such as water and alcohol, which exhibits much better solubility in water than the reported PDI-N3 as a result of quaternizing the precursor PDI-N3 (Fig. S1†).44 This property indicates that the PDI-N3I thin film is robust to support multilayer-device fabrication and could be compatible with roll to roll technique, realizing the green manufacture and commercialization of PSCs. The chemical structure and absorption spectrum of PDI-N3I were characterized, and the corresponding spectra were shown in Fig. S2, S3 and S4b,† respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PDI-N3I were determined to be −6.11 eV and −4.09 eV by combining the UPS result and UV-Vis absorption spectrum of PDI-N3I (Fig. S4a†). The LUMO energy level of PDI-N3I matches well with the LUMO energy level of PC71BM (−4.2 eV), implying that the appropriate energy alignment would produce smooth electron transport from the active layer to the cathode.21 The deep HOMO energy level of −6.11 eV is sufficient to block holes from PBTI3T, which is in favor of the improvement of PCE.46,47 These outstanding physical and chemical properties of PDI-N3I motivate us to explore its application as cathode interlayer in PSCs.

The conventional PSCs with structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBTI3T:PC71BM/CIL/Al were fabricated to disclose the potential application of the interfacial function of PDI-N3I in improving device performance. In this device structure, PDI-N3I, which was easily spin-coated onto the active layer from water and isopropanol (IPA) mixed solvents, was used as cathode interlayer to replace LiF. The chemical structure of PBTI3T and PC71BM, device structure and energy levels of the materials were presented in Fig. 1. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs with Al (without CIL), LiF/Al or PDI-N3I/Al as the cathode under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 were shown in Fig. 2a and the corresponding parameters of the PSCs were summarized in Table 1. The corresponding statistical performance data for each one of the devices was provided in Table S1.† The PDI-N3I/Al devices showed the highest PCE of 7.00% with the PDI-N3I film thickness of 22 nm, which was significantly higher than that (4.22%) of Al only device and clearly higher than that (6.54%) of traditional LiF/Al device. Compared with the LiF/Al device, the improvement in PCE of PDI-N3I/Al device resulted from the increased short current density (Jsc) from 10.41 mA cm−2 to 11.44 mA cm−2 outweighing the slightly declined fill factor (FF) from 73.10% to 71.88%. As we known, the device performance could also be improved by treating the top of active layer with alcohol, which was attributed to the increased internal electric field and surface potential of the improved device.7,48 In order to make sure the influence of mixed solvents on device performance, before depositing LiF/Al cathode, the device treated with H2O/IPA mixed solvents was fabricated as a control and exhibited a PCE of 6.41% comparable with the traditional device with LiF/Al as cathode. The result indicates that the enhancement of PDI-N3I/Al device only benefits from the optimized cathode interlayer. In addition, the dependence of PCE on the PDI-N3I cathode layer thickness was also investigated and we found that the PCE of PDI-N3I/Al device only changed from 6.69% to 7.00% as the film thickness ranged from 11 nm to 30 nm. Besides, we also compared the performance of PDI-N3I and reported PDI-N3 as the cathode interlayer. The corresponding device parameters were collected in Table S2.† We found that devices based on reported PDI-N3 exhibited a decreased PCE and film thickness tolerance compared with those based on PDI-N3I, which indicates that PDI-N3I is a better cathode interlayer material than the reported PDI-N3. The excellent characteristics of solution process, enhanced performance and thickness insensitivity of PDN-N3I as the CIL compared with LiF or other reported CILs make it a promising cathode interlayer material and suggest its potential application in the fast printing technique for large-scale fabrication of PSCs.

To better understand the Jsc increase of PDI-N3I/Al device compared with Al and LiF/Al device, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of different devices were characterized. As shown in Fig. 2b, the spectral shapes of the EQE response were almost identical for devices with different interlayers and therein PDI-N3I/Al device exhibited the highest EQE values across the entire wavelength range (from 300 nm to 800 nm), which was consistent well with the Jsc values measured from the J–V curves. The higher EQE values suggest that there is a more efficient photon-to-electron conversion for PDI-N3I/Al devices compared with LiF/Al device, which benefits the increase of Jsc.
In order to further explore the original enhancement in Jsc, photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiment was carried out to disclose the effect of different cathode interlayers on the exciton dissociation and charge transport,49,50 as shown in Fig. 3. The PL measurements were carried out from the side of PBTI3T or PBTI3T:PC71BM film to avoid the influence of light scattering through the glass substrate. The PL signals of blend films were amplified by 60× due to the low PL intensity. According to the PL spectra, we could observed that both films (pure PBTI3T films and PBTI3T:PC71BM blend films) coated with PDI-N3I showed higher PL quenching compared with the films coated with LiF or no interlayer, implying that the electron transfer between active layer materials and PDI-N3I was more efficient. In other word, the stronger electron extracting ability of PDI-N3I than LiF layer results in the easy transfer of electron from active layer to PDI-N3I layer and improved Jsc.

Additionally, the conductivity of PDI-N3I films along the vertical direction was determined with the device structure of ITO/PDI-N3I/Al to investigate the origin of thickness insensitivity for PDI-N3I as cathode interlayer. The J–V curve of PDI-N3I on logarithmical scales was shown in Fig. S5† and a slope of 1 was obtained, which implied that there was no space charge limited current but Ohm's law was followed. Therefore, PDI-N3I is not semiconductor but conducting material in the applied bias regime.51 The measured longitudinal direction conductivity of PDI-N3I was 2 × 10−6 S cm−1 via Ohm's law, which is nearly three orders of magnitude higher than that (6.9 × 10−9 S cm−1) of the classical solution-processed cathode interlayer PFN which performs extreme sensitivity to thickness.44 The intrinsically high conductivity contributes to the thickness insensitivity and compatibility with R2R mass production technique.
Furthermore, we noticed that the lower FF of PDI-N3I/Al devices compared with LiF/Al device restricted the improvement in PCE. To future enhance the PCE of PDI-N3I/Al device, we attempted to modify the cathode interface thoroughly by carrying out bilayered PDI-N3I/LiF cathode interlayer. Thus, a series of PDI-N3I layers with different thickness combined with 0.8 nm LiF as cathode interlayer were prepared to further optimize the device performance. Fig. 4 showed the J–V curves of the PSCs with LiF, PDI-N3I and PDI-N3I/LiF as the cathode interlayer and the corresponding device parameters including Jsc, Voc, FF, PCE, series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) values were collected in Table 2. The corresponding statistical performance data for each one of the devices was provided in Table S3.† After inserting 0.8 nm LiF between PDI-N3I and Al layer, the devices showed obviously improvement in FF (from 65.41% to 71.12% for 9 nm PDI-N3I/Al device and from 69.99% to 74.76% for 16 nm PDI-N3I/Al device) and slightly improvement in Voc (from 0.82 V to 0.86 V for 9 nm PDI-N3I/Al device and from 0.84 V to 0.86 V for 16 nm PDI-N3I/Al device), while the decline of Jsc could be neglected (from 11.4 mA cm−2 to 11.2 mA cm−2) as compared with PDI-N3I/Al device. The PDI-N3I/LiF/Al device combined the advantages of the LiF and PDI-N3I device, resulting a PCE of 7.18% with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 11.17 mA cm−2, a FF of 74.76%, which is an approximate 10% enhancement compared with that (6.54%) of LiF/Al device. We also observed that the Rs was decreased and the Rsh was enhanced after inserting LiF both for 9 nm PDI/Al and 16 nm PDI/Al device, which was in line with the device performance. It should be noted that the device with 22 nm PDI-N3I, performing the highest PCE in PDI-N3I/Al device, exhibited almost the same PCE after inserting 0.8 nm LiF, probably due to the increased Rs caused by the excessively thick cathode interlayer. The result suggests that the reduced Rs and increased Rsh after inserting LiF contribute to the enhancement of FF and the interfacial conditions between cathode and active layer become better probably including reduced interfacial resistance and recombination loss.

To understand the possible reason for the enhancement in FF, the UPS measurements were carried out to investigate the energy levels of bare Al, and Al covered by LiF, PDI-N3I, and PDI-N3I/LiF layers. Fig. 5a showed the UPS spectra of Al decorated by different interlayers and corresponding work function (WF) values were collected in Table 3. The obtained WF value of bare Al (4.26 eV) is consistent with the reported results.23 Upon modification with the PDI-N3I and LiF, the WF values declined to 4.04 eV and 3.62 eV, respectively. Interesting, after inserting 0.8 nm LiF between the Al and PDI-N3I layer, PDI-N3I/LiF/Al exhibited a much lower WF value of 3.42 eV. The lowered WF values of PDI-N3I/Al and PDI-N3I/LiF/Al compared with that of pristine Al and LiF/Al are related to the interfacial dipole endowed by the polar terminal group of PDI-N3I.21 As the decrement of cathodes' WF, the resulted built-in electric field gradually increased, which is of benefit to improve charge extraction and transport efficiency, reduce the build-up space charge and recombination loss. Thus, the devices' FF increased from 59.16% to 74.76% as the decrease of cathode WF from 4.26 eV to 3.42 eV for different devices (Fig. 5b), which leads to the enhanced device efficiency.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a water-soluble perylene diimides derivative with propylenetrimethylammonium as the terminal substitute was synthesized and incorporated as the cathode interlayer for conventional PSCs. The small-molecule PDI-N3I possesses easy accessibility and processability, appropriate energy levels, high longitudinal direction conductivity and more efficient electron extracting ability compared with LiF. These excellent properties of PDI-N3I as cathode layer gave a PCE of 7.00% for PBTI3T device, which was much higher than that of LiF/Al device. More importantly, the novel interface material displayed an even more appealing feature that the device could maintain good performance with PDI-N3I over a wide range of layer thickness, indicating its compatibility with large-area device processing techniques. Furthermore, a PCE of 7.18% was achieved by the use of bilayered PDI-N3I/LiF cathode interlayer, resulting from the simultaneous enhancement of Jsc and FF. Our results indicate that the solution-processed PDI-N3I is a novel promising cathode interlayer material, which is better than LiF in fabricating high performance conventional PSCs, and the appropriate cathode interface modification by incorporating PDI-N3I/LiF bilayer is also an effective way to achieve highly efficient conventional PSCs.
