    , Accepted 5th May 2022First published on 5th May 2022AbstractAll-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) are promising candidates to resolve the critical long-term stability issue in organic photovoltaics. Such an all-polymer combination exhibits features such as enhanced light absorption, high mechanical strength, and excellent morphological stability. In this work, to fully understand the correlation between the molecular structure and photovoltaic performance in all-PSCs, we performed systematical chlorine (Cl) substitution investigation in a benchmark all-PSC blending of the donor PBDB-T and acceptor N2200. The chlorine (Cl) substituted polymers show blue-shifted absorptions and down-shifted energy levels due to the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of the Cl atom. Besides, the chlorinated polymers exhibit noncovalent bonding, resulting in the change of polymer aggregation during the film-forming process, which further tunes the phase separation between the donor and acceptor polymers. When applied to all-PSCs, PBDB-T:N2200 based devices output a maximum efficiency of 8.44% with an appropriate blend morphology and a high fill factor. And the devices based on chlorinated all-PSCs yield higher open-circuit voltages approaching 1.0 V, but with decreased short-circuit current density. We believe that these results would provide more insights into the understanding of the correlation between the molecular structure and device performance in all-PSCs.
1. Introduction
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) attract lots of interest due to their advantage in enhancing both light-harvesting and the long-term stability of organic photovoltaics.1–7 In addition, the all-polymer blend shows good mechanical stability amongst various thin-film photovoltaic technologies, which is desired for developing high-performance flexible optoelectronic devices.4,6–10 However, the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution-processed all-PSCs has been around 6% for a while, which is significantly lower than that of the polymer-non-fullerene molecule system.5,11 At the early stage of development, there have only been a few investigations into all-PSCs. Many reported all-polymer systems suffer from low fill factors (FF) and short-circuit currents (Jsc), mainly due to undesirable morphological features in the all-polymer blend.4,5,12,13 High mobility n-type polymers based on naphthalene diimide (NDI) and perylene diimide (PDI) were synthesized to overcome the poor charge transportability of the acceptor polymers. However, the PCEs of the corresponding all-PSCs were still below 5%.14–16 This is mainly due to the large phase separation domains in the all-PSCs caused by the reduced mixing entropy of the donor and acceptor polymers.17–19 The process of all-PSCs is mostly attributed to the development of high-performance donor polymers, such as PBDB-T,20 PTB7-Th,21 and PTBzI-Si,22 which exhibit good miscibility with the acceptor polymers and form more suitable phase separation domains, and therefore the PCE was further improved to over 10%.23,24 Recently, with the great improvement in the efficiency of small molecule acceptor-based organic solar cells, researchers have been attracted to building high-performance all-polymer organic solar cells using polymerizing small molecule acceptors, and the current efficiency of all-PSCs has already exceeded 17%.25,26
π-Conjugated polymeric organic semiconductors with greater synthetic flexibility allow for the design of molecules with targeted performance.27,28 Under the circumstances, the optical bandgap, energy level, and solid packing arrangement can be modified by molecular modulation of either the backbone or side-chain structures.29–32 Halogenation in both polymers and molecules is considered an effective method to fine-tune the properties of optoelectronic materials.33 In such a halogenation process, typically H–F and H–Cl, have been shown to be efficient at tuning the molecular interaction and optimizing the interfacial free energy of the polymer mixture to form an interpenetrating cross-linked network in an active layer.34–36 Although halogenation has been widely reported, systematic investigation into the comparison of non-halogenated and halogenated polymer acceptors has only received minor attention in all-PSC systems. Lots of recent reports have demonstrated that chlorine (Cl) substitutions deliver various advantages: (1) the empty 3D orbitals of Cl atoms contribute to π-electron delocalization; thus further reducing the frontline molecular orbital energy levels; (2) the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of chlorine atoms facilitates the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect; (3) considering the less investigation into all-PSCs, further understanding of the role of Cl substitution in both the donor and acceptor would provide more insight into the complicated all-polymer system and new material design toward enhanced photovoltaic performance.34,36–40
Herein, we performed a systematical Cl substitution investigation in a classical all-polymer system blending the donor polymer PBDB-T and acceptor polymer N2200. Cl-PBDB-T and Cl-N2200 polymers were synthesized to investigate the effect of chlorination on crystalline structures, electrical properties, device performances, and the phase separation state of polymer blends. The aggregation properties of conjugated polymers play a critical role in film structures and the performance of solar cell devices.41,42 We anticipated that the insertion of Cl into the polymer materials can enhance donor–acceptor miscibility and blend morphology, resulting in significant differences in device performance. In comparison with PBDB-T and N2200, the Cl substituted polymers possess blue-shifted absorption and a down-shifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). The PBDB-T:N2200 based device with an appropriate blend morphology, outperformed a higher FF of 0.69 together with the best PCE of 8.44%. In contrast, the device based on chlorinated all-PSCs yields a significantly higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) approaching 1.0 V, but with a decreased FF and short-circuit current density.
2. Results and discussion
The polymeric materials PBDB-T, Cl-PBDB-T, N2200, and Cl-N2200, with molecular structures shown in Fig. 1a, were synthesized through Stille polycondensation to investigate the effect of chlorine-substituted donor and acceptor polymers in all-PSCs.43 The synthetic procedures for polymers are depicted in Scheme S1 in the ESI.† It should be noted that the polymer Cl-PBDB-T exhibits decreased solubility in commonly used solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene relative to PBDB-T, while the polymer Cl-N2200 shows better solubility than N2200. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured to investigate the light absorption behaviors of these polymers (Fig. 1b). Specifically, PBDB-T and Cl-PBDB-T exhibit similar film absorption spectra and the spectrum of Cl-PBDB-T is slightly blue-shifted (∼8 nm), which may be attributed to the change of polymer backbone planarity and intermolecular action due to chlorine substitution.44 Quite interestingly, the film absorption spectrum of Cl-N2200 is quite different from that of N2200. Cl-N2200 exhibits a double peak absorption and a considerable blue shift in the visible region (∼30 nm), indicating a significant change in backbone planarity intermolecular action changes, which will be discussed in the following section. As determined by the onset of film absorption, the optical bandgap (Eg) of PBDB-T, Cl-PBDB-T, N2200, and Cl-N2200 is 1.43 eV, 1.54 eV, 1.79 eV, and 1.82 eV, respectively. In addition, the HOMO energy levels of PBDB-T, Cl-PBDB-T, N2200, and Cl-N2200 were measured using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, see Fig. S1†), and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level values were further calculated according to their Eg. As shown in Fig. 1c, both the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of Cl-PBDB-T and Cl-N2200 undergo a distinct downshift relative to those of PBDB-T and N2200, respectively, which may be attributed to the electron-withdrawing ability of the Cl atom.

To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of chlorinated donor and acceptor polymers, all-PSCs with an inverted-type device structure of ITO/ZnO/bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer/MoO3/Ag were fabricated (Fig. 2a),45 and the detailed procedures for device fabrication are described in the Experimental section. We fabricated devices based on the polymer PBDB-T/Cl-PBDB-T as the electron donor, and N2200/Cl-N2200 as the electron acceptor, respectively. The optimal device processing conditions were obtained by adjusting processing solvents, active layer thickness, processing additives, and post thermal annealing (Tables S1–S3†). Interestingly, the optimal processing condition is different when incorporating either chlorinated donor or acceptor polymers, suggesting that the Cl substitution would alter the polymer crystallization process and phase separation between donor and acceptor polymers.5Fig. 2b shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best performing all-PSCs under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 simulated solar illumination, with the detailed photovoltaic characteristics shown in Table 1. All-PSCs based on PBDB-T:N2200 exhibit the highest PCE of 8.44%, with a Voc of 0.86, Jsc of 14.23 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.69, while the Cl-PBDBT:N2200 based device shows a slightly lower performance with a PCE of 6.01% due to a decreased Jsc of 11.39 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.55. However, the Cl-PBDBT:N2200 based all-PSCs exhibit a significantly higher Voc of 0.96 V relative to that of the PBDB-T:N2200-based one, which is attributed to the deeper HOMO energy levels of the chlorinated donor polymer.46 In contrast, for the chlorinated acceptor polymer, the Voc value of the PBDBT:Cl-N2200 device slightly decreases to 0.81 V, which is related to the downward shift of the LUMO energy level, while the FF remains almost unchanged. A similar trend was observed when comparing Cl-PBDB-T:N2200 and Cl-PBDB-T:Cl-N2200 based devices, a slightly decreased Voc and an enhanced FF were achieved by adopting a chlorinated acceptor polymer. These results demonstrate that a chlorinated donor polymer is beneficial for obtaining higher Voc, and a chlorinated acceptor polymer would guarantee a higher FF in some cases. To fully understand the change in the Jsc and FF, lots of device characterization studies were further performed.

External quantum efficiency (EQE) was further measured to evaluate the photoresponse of these all-polymer blends and to calibrate the Jsc. As shown in Fig. 2c, the N2200 based all-PSCs possess a wide photoresponse from 300 nm to 800 nm, with a maximum EQE value of over ∼70%. However, Cl-PBDB-T:N2200 based devices exhibit a lower EQE value in the region from 400 nm to 700 nm, confirming their lower Jsc relative to the PBDB-T:N2200 based one. For the Cl-N2200 based all-PSCs, the maximum EQE in both PBDB-T:Cl-N2200 and Cl-PBDB-T:Cl-N2200 based devices was around 50%. The Jsc values integrated from EQE spectra were 8.11 mA cm−2 and 9.03 mA cm−2, which agree within 5% of the measured Jsc from the AM 1.5G solar simulator. These observations indicate less efficient charge-transfer in chlorinated polymer-based devices. As observed from the dark current J–V curves of the optimized devices (Fig. 2d), the chlorinated polymer-based devices exhibit higher leakage current under reverse bias compared to the PBDB-T:N2200 based devices. These results require further investigation of the exciton and carrier dynamic processes to determine the correlation between the molecular structure and the photovoltaic properties of these polymers.
The charge transport properties of chlorinated polymers were first investigated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S2 and Table S4†), and the hole and electron mobilities of the corresponding all-polymer blend films are summarized in Fig. 3a.47 In comparison with the non-chlorinated PBDB-T:N2200 blend (hole mobility (μh) of 1.27 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), the Cl-PBDB-T:N2200 films exhibit a higher μh of 1.93 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, indicating that the Cl substitution on the donor polymer would enhance the hole transport properties. In contrast, in the Cl-N2200 based blend films, the values of both electron mobility (μe) and μh are significantly decreased relative to those of the N2200 based ones, which may be the main factor for their lower Jsc and FF. Moreover, we further performed steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements with 450 nm photo-excitation to understand the impact of Cl substitution on the charge-transfer and exciton dissociation processes. As shown in Fig. 3b, in comparison with the non-chlorinated PBDB-T:N2200 blend, the PL quenching efficiencies are slightly enhanced in both blend films of Cl-PBDB-T:N2200 and PBDB-T:Cl-N2200, suggesting a more effective photoinduced exciton dissociation.48 Quite unexpectedly, Cl-PBDB-T:Cl-N2200 exhibits apparent PL peaks, indicating serious charge-transfer and exciton dissociation issues. It is worth noting that both Cl-PBDB-T:N2200 and PBDB-T:Cl-N2200 based devices output a lower Jsc and FF. Therefore, we hypothesized that it may be due to the increased charge recombination during the transport process. To better understand the charge recombination process, the dependence of Jsc and Voc on the light intensity was measured in the all-polymer devices. As shown in the Jsc-light intensity measurements (Fig. 3c), the values of the exponential factor (α) as 0.96, 0.95, 0.97, and 0.97 for the devices based on PBDB-T:N2200, Cl-PBDB-T:N2200, PBDB-T:Cl-N2200, and Cl-PBDB-T:Cl-N2200 respectively, suggest a similar bimolecular recombination in all devices. In addition, the semi-logarithmic plot of Voc depends on the light intensity with a slope S of kT/q (Fig. 3d). In general, when S is larger than kT/q, it indicates serious trap-assisted recombination.49 The slopes were calculated to be 1.05 kT/q, 1.21 kT/q, 1.65 kT/q and 2.44 kT/q for PBDB-T:N2200, Cl-PBDB-T:N2200, PBDB-T:Cl-N2200 and Cl-PBDB-T:Cl-N2200, respectively. The significant trap-assisted recombination of chlorine-substituted based devices compared to non-chlorinated PBDB-T:N2200 blends may account for the lower Jsc of devices.

To better understand the carrier loss and the effect of chlorination of the polymer, we then performed temperature-dependent absorption measurements on the polymer in dilute solutions of chlorobenzene (0.01 mg mL−1) (Fig. 4). By gradually increasing the temperature to 100 °C, all polymers are well dissolved and disaggregated. Both PBDB-T and N2200 were reported to be highly-crystalline materials with a strong face-on orientation, especially in the case of N2200.50,51 The sharp absorption shifts of PBDB-T and N2200 further confirm strongly aggregated polymers even in the solution state.52 In contrast, the absorption spectra of the Cl-PBDB-T solution are relatively weakly shifted, indicating enhanced interactions between the polymers at a higher temperature, which may be attributed to the H–Cl noncovalent bonding.53 Notably, the absorption of Cl-N2200 significantly shifts as the temperature increases from 40 to 60 °C, indicating that the polymer chains undergo significant disaggregation at elevated temperatures.17 The polymers with high coplanarity exhibit larger intermolecular interactions, leading to stronger aggregation. The introduction of Cl atoms causes an apparent change in the intermolecular interactions of the polymer, which results in less coplanarity and aggregation of the polymers. Therefore, chlorination of either donor or acceptor polymers would provide an additional way to further tune the miscibility, and phase separation between donor and acceptor polymers, which is important for all-polymer blend-based optoelectronics devices.

The effect of chlorination on device charge generation and transport processes is very closely linked to the film morphology. To examine the correlation between the chlorinated polymer structure and device performance, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to gain insight into the all-polymer blend morphology, and the results are presented in Fig. 5. For the PBDB-T:N2200 blend film, both PBDB-T and N2200 exhibit high crystalline properties, and it shows distinct phase separation with a modest root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of 2.79 nm. In contrast, both Cl-PBDB-T:N2200 and PBDB-T:Cl-N2200 blend films display greater roughness, while different degrees of phase separation, may hinder the carrier transport. Specifically, Cl-PBDB-T:N2200 shows increased phase separation, indicating decreased miscibility, and Cl-N2200 can enhance the miscibility between donor and acceptor polymers, leading to a smaller phase separation scale. And it is interesting to find that the Cl-PBDB-T:Cl-N2200 blend film displays similar features relative to that of PBDB-T:N2200. TEM images can provide more details about the polymer crystalline fibers and phase separation, as shown in Fig. 5e–h, in comparison with the control PBDB-T:N2200 blend, chlorination of either the donor or acceptor can enhance the ordering and fiber structure of polymers in the blend, which would lead to a rougher surface. However, such a morphology is not desired for balanced carrier transport.54 For the chlorinated blend film (Cl-PBDB-T:Cl-N2200), it exhibits undesired phase separation with long-range order of acceptor polymer, which can explain the decreased photovoltaic performance. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the polymer energy level and morphology are critical for the design of all-PSCs, and chlorination is an effective approach to tune the polymer energy levels and solid-state molecular ordering, which would further alter the all-polymer blend morphology, and finally photovoltaic performance.

3. Conclusion
In summary, by introducing chlorination, a series of donor and acceptor polymers were synthesized. These modifications provided insights into the effect of chlorination on molecular properties, and device performance of all-PSCs. Specifically, through Cl substitution on either the donor polymer PBDB-T or acceptor polymer N2200, the optical absorption of the chlorinated polymers was blue-shifted. Meanwhile, we found that the chlorinated polymers achieved a significant change in energy levels and molecular aggregation behavior. Moreover, the chlorinated polymers exhibit enhanced hole transport properties, while decreasing electron mobility. As a result, the Voc of the devices based on chlorinated polymers is significantly higher, approaching 1.0 V, while the Jsc and FF decreased. Finally, we in-depth investigated the change of the carrier dynamic process and the morphological properties of these all-PSCs relative to non-chlorinated polymer devices. We believe that this work explains the key factors such as energy levels and polymer crystallinity in determining the photovoltaic properties of all-PSCs and provides more insights into the understanding of the relationship between the polymer structure and these important factors toward high-performance all-PSCs.

4.4 Device fabrication and measurements
Organic solar cells were fabricated with a structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially with acetone, deionized water, isopropanol, and acetone for 15 min each, and then treated with UV-ozone for 15 min. ZnO thin films spin-coated onto ITO substrates were obtained from ZnO precursor solution by the sol–gel method at 4000 rpm and then annealing for 10 min at 200 °C in air. Before spin coating of the active layer, the solution should be kept heated at 40 °C for at least 6 h. PBDB-T:N2200 and PBDB-T:Cl-N2200 (2:1, w/w, 8 mg mL−1/10 mg mL−1) in chloroform with 1.0 v% 1,8-diiodoocatane (DIO), were spin-coated on top of the ZnO layer at 2000 rpm for 40 s, followed by thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min. Cl-PBDB-T:Cl-N2200 (2:1, w/w, 15 mg mL−1) in chlorobenzene with 1.0 v% 1,8-diiodoocatane (DIO), was spin-coated on top of the ZnO layer at 2000 rpm for 40 s. Cl-PBDB-T:N2200 (2:1, w/w, 10 mg mL−1) in chlorobenzene and chloroform mixed solvent (1:1 vol/vol), was spin-coated on top of the ZnO layer at 3000 rpm for 40 s, followed by thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min. Finally, Ag (100 nm) as the cathode was deposited on MoOx (10 nm) using a vacuum thermal evaporator. The area of each device is 7.25 mm2. The performance of cells was tested under AM 1.5G light (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was determined using certified IPCE equipment (Zolix Instruments, Inc., SolarCellScan100).
