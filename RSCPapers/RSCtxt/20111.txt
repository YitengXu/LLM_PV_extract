    , Accepted 18th May 2022First published on 18th May 2022AbstractDeveloping universal theoretical models for perovskites (often denoted as ABX3) can contribute to the rational design of novel perovskite photovoltaic materials. However, few models can be successfully applied to study the intrinsic electronic structure due to the poor accuracy and unaffordable computational cost. Herein, we report the innovative construction of small practical cluster models through the similarity criterion of the central location environment, which retains only the central A-site as the original cation while the others are substituted by Cs to keep the clusters electrically neutral. The central cation has a chemical environment similar to that of the bulk perovskite. The binding energy between A and the BX framework, geometric structures (B–X distances and B–X–B angles), and the electronic structures (the gap and the spatial distribution of HOMO and LUMO, electron distribution) of these clusters have been investigated and compared with the corresponding properties of bulk materials. The results suggest that the cluster model with twelve B-atoms suitably describes these properties. The geometric structures and gaps are closer to the bulk situations than the quasi-one-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional cluster models with all-primitive cations, respectively. Other organic cations, such as NH3(CH2)nCH3 (n = 1, 2, and 3 for EA, PA, and BA, respectively), and (NH2)2CH (FA) can, therefore, mimic perovskite materials. Clusters with different sizes of A indicate that PA and BA will distort the quasi-cubic structures, which is consistent with the judgment of the tolerance factor of bulk materials. The reliable cluster model provides the research foundation for some basic issues of perovskites, such as vibrational spectroscopy and hydrogen bonding strength, to gain detailed insight into the interactions between A and the BX framework.
1 Introduction
The perovskites have great potential for photoelectric conversion and are promising materials for solar cells since perovskites can reach 25.5% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).1–3 Perovskites generally take the formula of ABX3, in which A = monovalent cations, B = divalent cations, and X = halide anions. Among these materials, the most popular one is MAPbI3 (MA = methylammonium).4–6 The other materials with suitable band gaps,7–9 high stability,9–14 and environmental friendliness15 are the design goal.
Theoretical calculations play a vital role in the design of materials. There are mainly two kinds of models, i.e., the periodic and cluster models. The periodic calculations of perovskites have had some success in predicting the structure and relative properties of photoelectric conversion.16–19 However, the bulk phase calculations are time-consuming20 and the periodic model does not flexibly reflect the local information. The internal structure and the interactions between the organic cation and inorganic BX framework remain to be studied. A cluster model that could easily separate the two parts may be a better choice for research on interactions. However, few universal cluster models are suitable for broad applications and could reflect a chemical environment similar to the bulk phase.
The research on cluster perovskites (also regarded as zero-dimensional perovskites) is mostly focused on the simplest cluster model ABX3, with only one A molecule, one B atom, and three X-site atoms.21–26 Although the simplest model is better for saving computational cost and remaining consistent with the bulk phase variation trend, it still has some differences compared with the practical situations,21,25 limiting the application ranges of research. It is necessary to construct larger perovskite cluster models that are closer to the actual situation. Varadwaj et al.27 constructed structures of (MAPbI3)n (n = 1–10) clusters that were similar to chain-like perovskites and found that as small clusters accumulated to a certain amount, properties (especially the HOMO–LUMO gap) similar to those of the bulk phase would appear, indicating the feasibility of imitating practical situations using cluster models. However, the chemical environment of each MAPbI3 section is different from that of the bulk phase, causing structural differences as compared with the bulk situation. Giorgi et al.28 did a fundamental study that reported the structures of perovskite clusters constructed by MA, Pb, and X. The chemical environment of the central MA in the largest model (with 12 Pb atoms) is similar to the bulk phase environment. Then, Manzhos et al.29 used this model to explore FA and GA (guanidinium) partially substituted systems. However, this type of model contains too many MA+ cations, and each MA+ has eight atoms and various orientations, making the structure quite complicated. We need to construct a cluster model that reflects a similar chemical environment to the bulk phase, avoids the complexity of the orientations of organic cations, and could be used in various situations.
Therefore, in this work, we have constructed a simpler cluster model to avoid the complexity of noncentral cation orientations, in which Cs+ cations are used at most A sites to provide the positive charge and stabilize the structure. Only one or two organic cations are retained at the A sites in the inner part of the clusters. The properties of different sizes of clusters with A = Cs and MA, B = Pb and Sn, X = Cl, Br, and I are studied and compared with that of bulk materials to verify the reliability of cluster models. The rationality of Cs+ substituting the outer-site cations is discussed. Various organic cations with different sizes and functional groups are considered in the largest model (with 12 B-site cations), including EA (ethylammonium, NH3CH2CH3), PA (propylammonium, NH3(CH2)2CH3), BA (butylammonium, NH3(CH2)3CH3), and FA (formamidinium, (NH2)2CH), to explore the application of this type of cluster model. The research method, which avoids the complexity of numerous cations, mainly focuses on the related properties of the central positions with the chemical environment most similar to the bulk phase. The reliable cluster model provides the research foundation for some basic issues of perovskites. Herein, the weak interactions between the organic cation and the anionic inorganic framework are studied in detail.
2 Methods
All the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Gaussian 16 program suite.30 Different geometric isomers were optimized with the PBE functional31 and LANL2DZ basis set.32 Dispersion correction33 was involved in all calculations in order to describe the weak interactions between organic cations and anionic frameworks more accurately. Frequency calculations were performed on the optimized structures to ensure that the stable structures have no imaginary frequencies. Vibrational analysis was performed to simulate the experimental spectra and understand the influence of the framework on A+. The reduced density gradient (RDG) method based on non-covalent interactions (NCI)34 was used for the weak interaction analysis. The properties of bond critical points (BCP) between organic cations and inorganic BX framework were calculated using the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) topological analysis to quantify the bond energy.35 The analysis of RDG and BCP was performed with the Multiwfn program.36
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Construction and properties of cluster models

3.1.1 Construction of cluster models. 
For the construction of cluster models AxByXz (A = Cs and MA, B = Pb and Sn, X = Cl, Br, and I), each B atom has six X atoms around it to ensure the same coordination number as in the bulk phase. The number of A is decided by the restriction that the whole system should be electrically neutral. The stable inorganic systems are denoted as CsBX-N, in which N is the number of B atoms, and N = 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. The corresponding organic systems are denoted as MABX-N, in which one (for N = 1, 2, 4, and 8) or two (for N = 12) Cs atoms are replaced by MA in CsBX-N clusters. The construction method follows the similarity criterion of the central location environment, which will be discussed in detail later. CsBX-N and MABX-N are collectively called ABX-N. The specific structures of systems with B = Pb and X = I are shown in Fig. 1. Similar cluster models are also calculated for systems with B = Sn, and X = Cl and Br.
 Fig. 1  Constructed cluster models of (a) inorganic systems CsPbI-N and (b) organic systems MAPbI-N (N = 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12). Blue/dark blocks indicate inner/central PbI3 locations, while orange/light blocks indicate corner locations, respectively. 
Taking B = Pb and X = I as an example, the simplest inorganic model in this work is CsPbI-1 (precisely, Cs4PbI6), as shown in Fig. 1(a). In CsPbI-1, one Pb atom and six I atoms divide the whole space into eight parts, called eight PbI3 spatial locations, and four Cs atoms are scattered into these locations. To have lower energy and be more stable, Cs atoms tend to be far apart from each other, and each pair of Cs atoms does not occupy any of the adjacent PbI3 locations due to Coulomb repulsion between two Cs+ ions, leading to the formation of a structure with Td symmetry. By replacing one Cs with a MA, the simplest organic perovskite model is obtained, denoted as MAPbI-1 (precisely, MACs3PbI6), as shown in Fig. 1(b). The orientation of MA is also taken into account to get the lowest energy structure.
For CsPbI-2 (i.e., Cs7Pb2I11), one I atom is shared by two Pb atoms, and twelve PbI3 spatial locations are formed. Seven of these locations are selected to be occupied by Cs atoms, and the most stable structure is shown in Fig. 1(a). In this structure, four Cs atoms occupy all the four inner PbI3 locations, and the other three Cs atoms separately occupy the remaining eight corner PbI3 locations. In the most stable structure of N = 2, Cs atoms prefer to occupy the inner PbI3 locations than the corner ones to make more Cs–I ionic bonds. When Cs atoms occupy the corner locations, they always stay far away from each other to reduce Coulomb repulsions, which can be found in the most stable structures of N = 1 and 2. The organic model MAPbI-2 is obtained by replacing one of the inner Cs atoms of CsPbI-2 with MA and selecting the most stable structure among different substitution positions. One I atom is far away from the nearby Pb atom (5.51 Å), and the bond between them is marked as a dotted line in Fig. 1.
For CsPbI-4 (i.e., Cs12Pb4I20), four Pb atoms form a quasi-square, and one I atom is shared by two nearby Pb atoms. There are eighteen PbI3 spatial locations, in which all the ten inner ones are occupied by Cs, while the other two Cs atoms occupy two corner locations, separately. The organic model MAPbI-4, which is obtained by replacing one of the two innermost Cs atoms of CsPbI-4 with MA, also follows the lowest-energy principle.
For CsPbI-8 (i.e., Cs20Pb8I36), eight Pb atoms form a quasi-cubic structure, and twenty-seven PbI3 spatial locations are formed. There are nineteen inner locations, which are all occupied by Cs atoms. Besides, only one Cs atom is left on one of the eight equivalent corner locations. The organic system MAPbI-8 is obtained by replacing the Cs at the central site (i.e., the most inner site) with MA and selecting the most stable structure among different MA orientation situations. In this structure, MA has an almost identical chemical environment to that in the bulk MAPbI3 perovskite materials.
As N increases to 12 (i.e., Cs28Pb12I52), twelve Pb atoms form a structure with two adjacent quasi-cubes, and thirty-six PbI3 spatial locations are formed, in which all the twenty-eight inner locations are occupied by Cs. The number of Cs is equal to the number of inner sites, resulting in the symmetric structure of N = 12. For the organic system MAPbI-12, the two Cs atoms at the center of two quasi-cubic frameworks are replaced by two MA, and the orientations of two MA molecules are taken into account. It is worth noting that the chemical environments of the two central sites of the N = 12 model are closer to the practical situation, which may be more reliable for further analysis.


3.1.2 Analysis of the binding energy between Cs or MA and BX in ABX-N. 
The stability of bulk phase perovskite has a close relationship with the binding energy between A (i.e., MA or Cs) and the remaining part (denoted as BX).37–39 For the cluster model ABX-N (A = Cs and MA, B = Pb and Sn, X = Cl, Br, and I; N = 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12), the binding energy can be defined based on neutral A and BX as ΔE1 = E(A) + E(BX) − E(ABX)(1)In this equation, E(A), E(BX), and E(ABX) are the energies of neutral A, BX, and the whole system, respectively. For N = 1, A is at one of eight corner sites, while for N > 1, A is at the central (innermost) site (see Fig. 1). Note that according to this definition, a larger positive binding energy means a stronger interaction between A and BX parts, therefore, indicating the higher stability of the whole system.
Taking electron transfer from A to BX into account, the binding energy can also be calculated based on charged systems, assuming that the whole system ABX is divided into A+ and BX−: (2)
For the system N = 12, we can also calculate the average binding energy (ΔE2) of the two central A parts based on neutral systems similar to eqn (1): ΔE2 = (2E(A) + E2(BX) − E(ABX))/2(3)In this equation, E2(BX) is the energy of the neutral fragment in which two central A fragments are removed. The results calculated in this way are close to that of eqn (1) (within 0.07 eV, Table S1, ESI†). This consistency suggests that both definitions are reasonable.
We also try to calculate the average binding energy  of each A+ when dissociating two A+ cations: (4)E2(BX2−) is the energy of the double charged fragment in which two central A+ are removed. However, the calculated results suggest that this method is unreasonable because the minimum difference reaches 0.7 eV as compared with eqn (2) (Table S1, ESI†). The following discussion for N = 12 only uses the results of eqn (1) or (2).
Both ΔE1 and  could not accurately represent the binding energy between A and the BX part since the charge on A (or BX part) is not exactly zero or one. Therefore, we describe this binding energy, denoted as Eb, by taking both ΔE1 and  into account in the following discussion unless specified. The results of the two methods show a common rule that Eb increases from N = 1 to 8 and decreases slightly to a relatively stable value from N = 8 to 12 (Fig. 2a and b). It suggests that the cluster models that reach N = 8 or 12 are suitable for describing the interaction between the A and BX parts. The comparison of the binding energies of CsBX-N and MABX-N shows that Eb(MA) is generally larger than Eb(Cs) with the same B and X. This rule is consistent with the bulk phase computed results, for which the stability of the MA system is higher than that of the Cs system.40 Specifically, Eb(Cs) is much smaller than Eb(MA) in small clusters without cage structures (N = 1, 2, and 4) because the presence of MA would lead to structural relaxation to reduce the energy of the system (see Fig. 1 and detailed discussion later). With the increase in N (N = 8 and 12), the cage structure composed of B–X is formed, and MA, which is in the center of the cage structure, has little influence on the BX structure. The difference in binding energy between CsBX-N and MABX-N decreases but still with Eb(Cs) < Eb(MA), except for ABCl-8, for which Eb(Cs) > Eb(MA) but the difference in Eb for the two systems is only about 0.1 eV.
 Fig. 2  The binding energies between A and BX parts and the geometric parameters for ABX-N (A = Cs and MA; B = Pb and Sn; X = Cl, Br, and I; N = 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12). The binding energies of (a) neutral systems (ΔE1, eV) and (b) charged systems (, eV), (c) the B–X average distance (davg, Å), and (d) maximum angle of B–X–B (Amax, °). 
The following analysis is focused on the largest model (N = 12). For specific B or X, Eb(CsBX-12) < Eb(MABX-12), the energy difference between the two systems is within 0.2 eV, indicating that MABX-12 is more stable than CsBX-12. For specific A and B, the results of  show that the binding energy has the order Cl > Br > I (Fig. 2b), which is consistent with the rule of decomposition enthalpy41–43 and thermodynamic stability9,44 of different halogen systems in the bulk phase. In the experimental work on Pb and Sn systems, it was found that Sn systems are less stable because they are more prone to have the degradation of the perovskite structure under ambient conditions.45,46 However, the bulk phase calculations show that the decomposition enthalpy (i.e., the energy needed in the process of ABX3 → AX + BX2) of Sn systems is higher than that of Pb systems, which indicates that the Sn system is more stable.40,43,47 Our work pays more attention to the binding energy between A and BX instead of the thermodynamics analysis and thus may reflect the stability more directly. The cluster model results (Fig. 2a) show that ΔE1 of the APbX-12 is higher than that of the corresponding ASnX-12, suggesting that Pb systems with a higher internal interaction between A and BX3 are more stable than Sn systems. Therefore, our calculation results based on cluster models are consistent with the experimental results in terms of the stability of materials.


3.1.3 Structural properties of ABX-N. 
It was suggested that the B–X distance is also closely related to stability.48 The average B–X distance, denoted as davg, is the average distance of six B–Xt bonds (Xt is the terminal X) for N = 1, while for N > 1, davg is the average distance of all B–Xb bonds (Xb is the bridge X) since B–Xb bonds have a similar chemical environment to the bulk phase. As shown in Fig. 2c, the davg decreases with the increase in N for all twelve investigated systems. From N = 8 to 12, the extent of the decline becomes smaller, and davg reaches a relatively unchanged value. This indicates that the clusters of N = 8 and 12 could describe davg well. Comparing the davg of the clusters (N = 1 is not considered) with different A, B, and X, it was found that davg has no obvious difference between CsBX and MABX, davg(Pb–X) is larger than davg(Sn–X), and davg declines significantly when X changes from I to Br and then to Cl. The difference in davg for the studied clusters is mainly caused by the different sizes of X and B atoms, and the larger atom size (Pb > Sn; I > Br > Cl) is related to the longer davg. For the smallest N = 1 cluster, there are some exceptions. The davg of CsBX-1 is shorter than that of MABX-1 since the organic fragment would lengthen B–Xt to cause structural deformation. This may also be the reason for the obvious difference in binding energy between Cs- and MA-systems in the non-cage-like structure mentioned above. Compared with the davg of larger cluster models, MABBr/Cl-1 performs differently when the B element changes. However, the differences between them are small, i.e., MAPbBr-1 is 0.002 Å smaller than MASnBr-1, and MAPbCl-1 is 0.01 Å smaller than MASnCl-1.

Table 1 compares the calculated davg values for N = 12 clusters in this work and the experimental B–X distance (d0, as the half value of the lattice constant)49–57 for the cubic phase ABX3. The results show that although davg is generally higher than d0, the root mean square difference between davg and d0 for CsBX-12 and MABX-12 is only 0.11 and 0.09 Å, respectively, and the maximum difference between davg and d0 is 0.13 Å, indicating that ABX-12 cluster models are quite reliable for providing the davg values. From the comparison of the davg data between Cs- and MA-systems, both calculated and experimental, it was found that davg changes slightly when the central cation changes from Cs to MA, while B and X keep the same elements. For davg, the maximum difference is 0.01 Å, and for d0, the maximum difference is 0.08 Å. It shows that Cs and MA have a similar influence on davg, indicating that they may have similar radii and it is appropriate to use Cs instead of MA to construct the cluster models.

The B–X–B angle (AB–X–B) is also an important parameter for characterizing the structure of ABX3. Marchenko et al.58 investigated 515 two-dimensional perovskite-like crystal structures and found that with the increase of the two-dimensional material thickness, the influence of the interlayer long chains on the middle layer gradually decreases. Therefore, the AB–X–B in the middle layer gradually approaches 180° with increased thickness. Fig. 2d shows the maximum AB–X–B (Amax) of ABX-N (N > 1), and the average AB–X–B (Aavg) is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Similar to the definition of B–Xb bonds, here only B–Xb–B with bridge X is considered. For CsBX-N (the left panel of Fig. 2d), Amax decreases with N from 2 to 4 and increases from 4 to 12 for systems with the same B and X. The transformation at N = 4 may be due to the formation of the B–X closed frame structure. For systems with the same A and B, Amax decreases with the variation of Cl, Br, and I. For MABX-N (the right panel of Fig. 2d), Amax is more complicated. With the increase of N, the trend change of Amax occurs not only at N = 4 but also at N = 8. Compared with CsBX-8, the Amax of MABX-8 is closer to 180°, meaning that it is closer to the structure of the BX framework in bulk perovskites. Differently, the two MA cations in MABX-12 may interact with each other. For X = Br and Cl, Amax decreases remarkably because the synergistic effect of the two MA cations would distort the BX structure to some extent. For X = I, the BX framework is not affected by this effect. Amax of MABI-12 is larger than that of MABI-8, and it is also larger than those of MABBr-12 and MABCl-12.
The variation of Amax and Aavg of MABX-N from N = 8 to 12 suggests that the influence of MA on AB–X–B decreases with the variation of Cl, Br, and I. This phenomenon could be understood as the X-site atom with more electronegativity would interact with NH3 to a larger degree, and the relatively large B–I bond may also reduce the influence. The two organic fragments in MABX-12 may cause the obvious deformation of the structure, suggesting that it is necessary to consider cluster models with more than one organic cation (i.e., with N = 12). On the other hand, when the number of N increases from 8 to 12, the inorganic system will not change the variation trend of the Amax and Aavg. It indicates that the Cs atom, whose size is similar to MA and would not cause the structure deformation, is a reasonable choice for filling the outer A site.
When we focus on the variation of Aavg (Fig. S1, ESI†), it is found that Aavg decreases with the variation of Cl, Br, and I for all systems with the same A and B. After B and X atoms form a closed frame structure (N ≥ 4), Aavg(Sn–X–Sn) > Aavg(Pb–X–Pb) in both MABX-N and CsBX-N. These variation roles could be related to the davg, in that when the same A fills the center of ABX-N with different B and X, the small Aavg usually accompanies the long davg.


3.1.4 Electronic structural characteristics of ABX-N. 
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of clusters corresponds to the valence band maximum (VBM) of bulk materials, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) corresponds to the conduction band maximum (CBM). Although the HOMO–LUMO gap of the cluster model has some differences compared with the band gap of the bulk phase, the two types of gaps have a close relationship, and studies on the HOMO–LUMO gap may provide useful information on bulk phase band gaps.25,27,28 Gao et al.25 used the simplest cluster models to verify that the variation trend of the HOMO–LUMO gaps of MAPbX3 clusters with different halides is similar to that of the band gaps of bulk phase MAPbX3 obtained from experiments and theoretical calculations. Varadwaj et al.27 accumulated fifteen MAPbI3 clusters as a quasi-one-dimensional long chain and got the HOMO–LUMO gap, which is similar to the experimental band gap of the bulk phase, indicating the feasibility of evaluating band gaps using cluster models. Giorgi et al.28 doped Br atoms into the MA4PbI6 cluster and found that the change in the HOMO–LUMO gap with doping concentration could fit well with that of the bulk phase. It further illustrates that the cluster model could reflect the gap variation rule of different systems.
The HOMO–LUMO gap (shorted as gap) of the ABX-N cluster model was calculated. Note that for N < 12 clusters, the corner site Cs atoms, whose coordination is unsaturated, can generate a new empty orbital to be the LUMO, leading to the unusual small gap. Therefore, to make the results more reliable, the orbitals of the corner site Cs are not considered in the following discussion on electronic structures. This situation would not happen for N = 12 clusters since all the Cs atoms are in the inner site, which further illustrates the reasonability of the N = 12 cluster model. The gaps after this revision are shown in Fig. 3(a). The gap of each ABX-N decreases with N from 1 to 8, while it has similar values for N = 8 and up to 12. The gap of cluster models with different sizes has the rules that Cl > Br > I with the same A and B, and Pb > Sn with the same A and X, which are consistent with the variation rules of the bulk phase.58–61 For convenient comparison, the results of the gaps of N = 12 are shown in Fig. 3(b). The HOMO–LUMO gap of MAPbI-12 (2.73 eV) is closer to the experimental band gap (1.69 eV) than that of the quasi-two-dimensional cluster models with all-primitive cations (3.52 eV).28,62 The gap of MAPbX-12 is higher than MASnX-12 by 0.6–0.7 eV with the same A and X, which is similar to the experimental results that bulk MAPbI3 has a higher band gap than MASnI3 by 0.32 eV.63 When B and X are the same, the calculated gaps of CsBX-12 and MABX-12 are almost the same (i.e., within 0.05 eV), which is similar to the experimental results that the difference is within 0.10 eV for bulk CsSnX3 and MASnX3, and within 0.15 eV for Pb systems.63 When A and B are the same, the gaps of clusters also show the same rule as bulk phase materials, that is, ABCl-12 > ABBr-12 > ABI-12,60,64 in which ABBr-12 is higher than ABI-12 by 0.22–0.34 eV and ABCl-12 higher than ABBr-12 by 0.22–0.28 eV.

The spatial distributions of the HOMO and LUMO of CsPbI-12 and MAPbI-12 are shown in Fig. 4. The results suggest that the HOMO is mainly contributed by Pb and I atoms, while the LUMO is mainly from Pb atoms, which is consistent with the findings of bulk materials.65 Besides, the partial density of states (PDOS) and total density of states (TDOS) of CsPbI-N and MAPbI-N (N = 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12) (Fig. S2 in the ESI†) suggest that the contributions of the inner site Cs atoms and MA are deep in the valence band or conduction band, corresponding to the bulk phase results that they have no direct influence on band gap.65–67

3.1.5 Electron distribution of ABX-12. 
Four methods are used to perform the electronic population analysis, including the atom in molecules method (AIM),35,68 the atomic population method with deformation density partition and empirical parameter correction (CM5),69 the charge based on restrained electrostatic potential (RESP),70–72 and the natural population analysis (NPA).73 The first three were calculated by the Multiwfn program,36 while NPA was calculated with the procedure implanted in the Gaussian program.

Table 2 lists the average charges on central A cations (QA) by the AIM method, which have the order QA(I) < QA(Br) < QA(Cl). This trend agrees well with the electronegativities of halogen atoms (X), where X with a larger electronegativity may draw more electrons from A. The variational trend of QA is shown more clearly in Fig. S3 in the ESI,† together with the results calculated by the other three methods. CM5 charges generally have the same trend as AIM charges, except for MAPbBr-12 and MASnBr-12, while RESP (see also the values in Table 2) and NPA charges suggest the opposite trend. So AIM charges are found to be more reasonable based on the relationship between QA and the electronegativities of halogen atoms.

The average charges on B (QB) and X (QX) are also listed in Table 2 by both AIM and RESP methods. RESP charges look weird not only on A-cations but also on halogen atoms. Taking CsPbX-12 as an example, the order QX(I) < QX(Br) < QX(Cl) indicates that I has the most negative charges which is the opposite of the order of electronegativities of halogen atoms. On the other hand, AIM charges have the correct order QX(I) > QX(Br) > QX(Cl) for all systems, which further supports the validation of the AIM analysis method in this work. Therefore, only AIM charges are considered in subsequent discussions. Charges on Cs+ are generally larger than those on MA+, while the QB/QX of CsBX-12 and those of MABX-12 are very similar, indicating that the BX framework may have similar properties even with different A cations. The charges of Pb systems are very close to those of Sn systems, which is consistent with the very close electronegativities of Pb and Sn.
The electron density difference (Δρ) is also a possible way to show the charge distribution. Taking the systems with Pb as examples, Δρ is calculated as Δρ = ρ(APbX-12) − ρ1(A) − ρ2(A)(5)The ρ(APbX-12), ρ1(A), and ρ2(A) are the electron density distributions of the whole system, and two central neutral A, respectively. Only negative values of Δρ are shown in Fig. 5 (drawn by VMD74), which can reflect the positive charges on A-cations. It was found that the positive charges on Cs+ in CsPbX-12 have the order I < Br < Cl and those on MA+ of MAPbX-12 are mainly localized on the NH3 part. These results are generally consistent with the chemical intuition and the AIM results.

3.2 Application of ABX-12 cluster models with other A-site cations

3.2.1 Geometric and electronic structures of A′PbI-12 with A′ = EA, PA, BA, and FA. 
The cluster models ABX-12 contain two cubic cages, and the A in the center of the cage has a similar environment to the bulk phase. The above discussion on ABX-12 indicates that it could be a reasonable model to investigate systems with other organic cations at the A-site. We selected the organic cations A′ = EA, PA, and BA, which have the same NH3-functional group and different carbon chain lengths as compared with MA, to investigate the influence of different sizes of cations on the properties of the systems. The organic cation FA was also selected, which has different functional groups and is commonly used in perovskite materials.
The most stable structures are shown in Fig. 6. The structural information and electronic features are listed in Table 3. The data of MAPbI-12 are also listed for convenient comparison. The first four lines in Table 3 are the systems with the same NH3-functional group. The calculated results suggest that the maximum and average B–Xb distances (dmax and davg, respectively) would increase with the increase in the length of the organic carbon chains. However, when the minimum B–Xb distance (dmin) was compared, it was found that dmin of MAPbI-12 and EAPbI-12 with short organic chains is even longer than that of PAPbI-12 and BAPbI-12 with long organic chains. This anomaly indicates that the whole structure may have a large deformation for A′PbI-12 clusters with long-chain organic cations (i.e., A′ = PA and BA).

The minimum B–Xb–B angle (Amin) could also be used to measure the local deformation degree of the cage structure. The data in Table 3 suggest that Amin would decrease with the enlargement of organic chains, and the difference between Amin and the average B–Xb–B angle (Aavg) gradually increased, which shows that including PA and BA would cause the BX framework to deform. As for FAPbI-12, the B–X distance is similar to that of EAPbI-12, and its Aavg is the highest among all the systems listed in Table 3. What is more, the variation of AB–X–B for FAPbI-12 is small, that is, the difference between Aavg, Amin, and Amax (maximum B–Xb–B angle) is quite small. Therefore, the BX framework of FAPbI-12 is very close to the perfect cube. Previous studies75–77 indicated that the structural tolerance factors of bulk APbI3 materials with A = MA, EA, and FA are between 0.8 and 1.0, so they have high structural stability with three-dimensional perovskite structures. However, the structural tolerance factors of PAPbI3 and BAPbI3 are out of this range, and these two perovskites could not exist stably.78 Here, our calculated results for these structures can achieve the same conclusions of the different stabilities of perovskites with different A-site cations, which further confirms the reasonability of using ABX-12 cluster models to investigate the properties of perovskites. Besides, the deformation of PAPbI-12 and BAPbI-12 is mainly around CH3-rather than NH3-groups, because the interaction between CH3 and the BX framework is a repulsive force, while the interaction between NH3 and BX is still attractive as the size of organic cation increases.
Two types of binding energies, ΔE1 and  were calculated for APbI-12 clusters. For the first four systems with the NH3 functional group, ΔE1 is higher than  by 0.1–0.6 eV. Both methods show that systems with short-chain organic cations (MA or EA) have larger binding energies than those with long-chain organic cations (PA or BA), indicating that the stability of the system would decrease sharply with the structural deformation. Differently,  is higher than ΔE1 by 0.5 eV for FAPbI-12. This phenomenon is because the ionization energy of FA is much higher than the former organic cations with NH3. The calculated values of the ionization energies of MA, EA, PA, BA, and FA are 3.97, 3.81, 3.76, 3.73, and 4.55 eV, respectively. Since the binding energy of FA, which also has a short-chain structure, is less than that of MA- and EA-systems, the stability of the bulk phase FAPbI3 is probably low.
We calculated the HOMO–LUMO gap (Eg) of different cluster models. The results suggest that the Eg of systems with short-chain organic cations (MA and EA) is large, and it would decrease with the increase in the length of the organic cation. Although the A-site has little contribution to the HOMO or LUMO, it could indirectly influence the gap through the impact on the structure. A short Pb–I distance in some systems may enhance the interaction between Pb and I, thus leading to the larger energy gaps of bulk materials.79 The results of cluster models in Table 3 also indicate that short Pb–I bonds correspond to large HOMO–LUMO gaps. Moreover, the Pb–I distance of FAPbI-12 is close to those of two short-chain systems, making its Eg higher than those of long-chain systems.
For A′PbI-12, we calculated the AIM charges of the two organic cations (QA1 and QA2) and their average value (QAavg). QA1 and QA2 are almost the same for MA and EA systems (the difference is within 0.0004 e), while the difference between QA1 and QA2 of PA and BA systems is obvious, indicating that the chemical environment of two A′ cations is quite different due to the large structural deformation of PA and BA. For FAPbI-12, we tested many orientations and got structures with similar energies (within 0.1 eV). The most stable one shown in Fig. 6 does not have obvious deformation of the cubic cage structure. However, the charge difference of the two FA is about 0.03 e, indicating that the FA cations of bulk phase FAPbI3 may have not only geometric uncertainty but also a great difference in the electronic structure.


3.2.2 Vibrational analysis of MAPbX-12 (X = I, Br, and Cl) and A′PbI-12 (A′ = EA and FA). 
Infrared (IR) and Raman vibrational spectroscopies are powerful tools for investigating microscopic structures and interactions. Glaser et al. performed an IR spectroscopic study of the vibrational modes of halide perovskites and confirmed that significant hydrogen bonding exists in all studied perovskites.80 Here, vibrational analysis was performed on MAPbX-12 (X = I, Br, and Cl) to see the variations of different halides. What is more, according to the former discussion, organic cations MA+, EA+, and FA+ could exist stably in the PbX framework without the deformation of the cubic structure. Therefore, vibrational analysis was also performed on A′PbI-12 (A′ = EA and FA). In the vibrational analysis, the outside Cs and X atoms are fixed, while the central site cations and BX cubic frames are considered. The results of the high-frequency vibrational modes (>780 cm−1) are shown in Fig. 7. The specific numbers are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). For comparison, vibrations of free organic cations are also provided.
 Fig. 7  The main vibrational modes of free cations (a) MA+, (e) EA+, (g) FA+ and the cations in systems (b) MAPbI-12, (c) MAPbBr-12, (d) MAPbCl-12, (f) EAPbI-12, and (h) FAPbI-12. The outside Cs atoms are not shown in these structures. 
The vibrational frequencies of C–N and C–C stretching modes for organic cations MA+ and EA+ always increase due to space limitations when they are put into the BX cubic framework. This space restriction has a greater impact on EA+ than on MA+, which can be seen from the fact that the difference in C–N stretching for MA+ and MAPbI-12 is 57 cm−1 (the average value for two MA+ in MAPbI-12), while that for EA+ is 63 cm−1. As the X-site changes from I to Br, and to Cl, the increase of the C–N stretching vibrational frequency also becomes more remarkable (916 cm−1 for the free MA+, while 973, 984, and 997 cm−1 in MAPbX-12 for X = I, Br, and Cl, respectively), which is consistent with the experimental findings by Glaser et al.80 This can be interpreted that as the X-site changes to become more electronegative and have a smaller atomic radius (thus shorter davg), the smaller space and the stronger interaction between MA+ and the BX framework may lead to higher restrictions on the central cation. Another study on the vibrations of MAPbBr3 with different phases shows that the C–N stretching mode may blue shift with the contraction of the inorganic cage.19 On the other hand, the variation of symmetric and asymmetric N–C–N stretching vibrational frequencies for FAPbI-12 are all quite small. The symmetric ones are shown in Fig. 7, and the asymmetric ones (not shown in Fig. 7) are 1738 and 1734/1742 cm−1 for free FA+ and FAPbI-12, respectively. This could be interpreted that the N–C–N chain is more rigid than C–N or C–C–N in MAPbX-12 and EAPbI-12. Our results correspond to former studies, suggesting that FA+, a planar symmetrical structure with weaker polarization,81 has a weaker interaction with the PbX framework than other organic cations mentioned before.82
For the N–H stretching mode, the interaction between NH3 and the PbX framework causes the vibrational frequencies of MA+ and EA+ to decrease after they are put into the PbX cage. The variation of EA+ is larger than that of MA+, indicating that the NH3 of the former one has a stronger interaction with the PbX framework. The vibrational frequency of N–H stretching in FA+ also decreases when in the PbX framework. However, the extent of variation of FA+ is smaller than that of MA+ and EA+, indicating that the interaction between NH2 and PbX is smaller than that between NH3 and PbX. The result is the same as the previous rule for the vibrational changes in the C–N stretch, i.e., EA > MA > FA. The N–H vibration frequency of MAPbX-12 with different X are quite similar (b, c, d), which is consistent with the experimental findings of Glaser et al.,80 and was explained by the small difference in hydrogen bond strength between NH and X in these systems. A quantitative calculation of the hydrogen bond energy was further carried out on these systems. The vibrational frequencies of C–H stretching in the free MA+ have fewer differences as compared with those in MAPbX-12, indicating that CH3 has a weak interaction with PbX frameworks. Similar situations were found for the CH3 and CH2 in EA+ and EAPbI-12. For FAPbI-12, the variation in one of the C–H stretches is relatively large, but it is still much smaller than the variation in N–H stretches. The much smaller variation of C–H as compared with N–H suggests that the attractive interactions between the organic cations and PbX frameworks are mainly through the NH3 or NH2 functional groups, instead of the CH3 group, which is consistent with the previous discussion on the structural analysis of PAPbI3 and BAPbI3.
The torsional modes of organic cations are located in the low-frequency region. Compared with free organic cations, the vibrational frequency may decrease due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the cations and the surrounding X atoms. On the other hand, the vibrational frequency would increase due to the deformation of cations constrained by the inorganic cage.83 In our calculated results, the torsional mode of the free MA+ (297 cm−1) increases after putting it into the MAPbX-12 for X = I, Br, and Cl (314, 321, and 325 cm−1, respectively, for the average values of two MA+), indicating that the influence of the hydrogen bond is less than that of the deformation of MA+. Similar situations were found for EA and FA systems: the vibrational frequencies of the torsional mode increased from 212 cm−1 of free EA+ to 254 cm−1 of EAPbI-12, and from 539 cm−1 of free FA+ to 585 cm−1 of FAPbI-12. Quarti et al.83 compared the torsional modes of MA+ in three cases: free MA+, MA+ with three I atoms around the NH3, and MA+ in the bulk phase. The vibrational frequencies of the MA+ torsional mode in the cluster model MAPbI-12 (313.4 and 314.0 cm−1) are quite similar to those in Quarti's work with periodic models (295, 299, 312, and 315 cm−1). Both are consistent with the experimental value (305 cm−1).84 Besides, our torsional mode of MA+ in MAPbBr-12 (321 cm−1) is also consistent with the experimental value (323 cm−1).19 These results indicate that the N = 12 cluster model is reasonable. As for the comparison between isolated MA+ and the MA+ in the whole ABX structure, Quarti et al. pointed out that when the interactions between the MA cations and the three closest iodides are considered with the MA⋯I3 cluster model, the frequencies of the torsional modes shift to lower values, and they become even lower in the periodic model. Our calculation confirmed that the interaction between A and BX would change the vibrational frequency as mentioned by Quarti et al., but we got the opposite results in the variation trend (i.e., the frequencies would increase from isolated MA+ to MA+ in MAPbX-12). The reason for the difference may be that the structures of isolated MA+ and MA⋯I3 cluster in their work were derived from bulk phase structure without further optimizations before frequency calculations. Further experimental work on this interesting phenomenon is expected.


3.2.3 RDG analysis of MAPbX-12 (X = I, Br, and Cl) and A′PbI-12 (A′ = EA and FA). 
The results of RDG analysis of five N = 12 systems (MAPbX-12 (X = I, Br, and Cl), EAPbI-12, and FAPbI-12) are shown in Fig. 8 (drawn by Gnuplot85). The region with a negative value of sign(λ2) × ρ represents the van der Waals interaction and relatively stronger interactions such as hydrogen bonding, and the spike with a more negative value corresponds to a stronger interaction. In Fig. 8, the region of sign(λ2) × ρ between −0.01 and 0.00 a.u. corresponds to weak interactions, including those of Cs⋯X, CH⋯X, and some NH⋯X; the region between −0.02 and −0.01 a.u. corresponds to the hydrogen bonding interaction of NH⋯X; the region lower than −0.02 a.u. corresponds to the interaction of Pb⋯X, as has been pointed out in previous work.26 For MAPbX-12 with different X atoms (a–c), the distribution of the spikes below −0.02 a.u. shifts to a more negative region, indicating that the interaction strength has the order of Pb⋯I < Pb⋯Br < Pb⋯Cl. The distributions of the spikes are basically the same (−0.2 to −0.26 a.u.) for Pb⋯I in systems with different organic cations (a, d and e).
 Fig. 8  The color-filled sign(λ2)ρ vs. RDG scatter map of (a) MAPbI-12, (b) MAPbBr-12, (c) MAPbCl-12, (d) EAPbI-12, and (e) FAPbI-12. The areas colored in blue, cyan, and green represent very strong, strong, and medium-to-weakly bound interactions, respectively, whereas those colored in red represent repulsive interactions. In labels the interaction between (N)H and X. 
The NH⋯X interaction is of particular interest due to its close relationship to the stability of perovskites.19,86 The spikes marked with arrows in Fig. 8 represent the (N)H⋯X interaction (Ii), for which X is the halogen atom nearest to H. The specific RDG analyses of each pair of (N)H⋯X are shown in Fig. S4–S8 (ESI†). For MAPbX-12 and EAPbI-12, there are six pairs of (N)H⋯X, but only two or three can be distinguished in Fig. 8(a–d), which are labelled as I1 (I2) and I3. For MAPbX-12, the sign(λ2) × ρ values of I1 (I2) and I3 become more negative as X changes from I to Br and Cl, indicating that the (N)H⋯X interaction has the order of H⋯Cl > H⋯Br > H⋯I. Through the comparison of MAPbI-12 and EAPbI-12, it was found that the sign(λ2) × ρ values of I1 and I2 of EAPbI-12 are more negative than those of MAPbI-12, while those of I3 are similar. This shows that the NH⋯X interaction in EAPbI-12 is stronger than that in MAPbI-12, which is consistent with the former conclusion that the variation of the N–H vibrational frequency of EAPbI-12 is larger than that of MAPbI-12. For FAPbI-12, all the eight (N)H⋯I interactions are located in the region between −0.01 and −0.02, and cannot be distinguished clearly. As such, they are labelled as I1–8 in Fig. 8(e), with decomposed interactions shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). For FAPbI-12, the strongest (N)H⋯X interaction is between the strongest I1 of MAPbI-12 and EAPbI-12, and the weakest (N)H⋯X interaction is larger than the weakest I3 of both MAPbI-12 and EAPbI-12.


3.2.4 Hydrogen bond strength of MAPbX-12 (X = I, Br, and Cl) and A′PbI-12 (A′ = EA and FA). 
The properties of bond critical points (BCP) of hydrogen bonds were calculated for MAPbX-12 (X = I, Br, and Cl), EAPbI-12, and FAPbI-12 to get more quantitative data for the strength of hydrogen bonds. When the electron density of a BCP, denoted as ρ(rBCP), meets the criteria (i) 0.002 < ρ(rBCP) < 0.034 (a.u.) and (ii) 0.024 < ∇2ρ(rBCP) < 0.139 (a.u.), then it indicates hydrogen-bonding at this BCP.19 According to these criteria, hydrogen bonds are found between (N)H or (C)H and X atoms, and the corresponding BCPs and bond paths are shown in Fig. 9. Hydrogen bonding energy (EHB) is estimated with a fitting formula proposed by Emamian et al.,87EHB = 9.674 × ρ(rBCP) − 0.032 (eV), in which ρ(rBCP) is in a.u. The calculated values of EHB are also given in Fig. 9, and larger positive values reflect stronger hydrogen bonds. Only one inorganic PbX quasi-cubic cage and the inside organic cation are shown for each system since the results of the two cages are generally the same.
 Fig. 9  The hydrogen bonds between the internal cations and the inorganic PbX cage for (a) MAPbX-12 (X = I, Br, and Cl), (b) EAPbI-12, and (c) FAPbI-12. The hydrogen bond energies (EHB) are given in eV. 
One hydrogen bond exists between each (N)H and X in all the studied systems. For MAPbX-12, the strength follows the trend of Cl > Br > I for all the NH⋯X hydrogen bonds. The NH⋯I hydrogen bonds in EAPbI-12 are generally stronger than those in MAPbI-12. Systems with larger electronegative halide atoms and longer organic chains for central cations would have stronger NH⋯X hydrogen bonds. The strength of the strongest NH⋯X bond of FAPbI-12 is between that of MAPbI-12 and EAPbI-12, while the strength of the weakest bond of FAPbI-12 is larger than that of MAPbI-12 and EAPbI-12. The results regarding the strength of NH⋯X hydrogen bonds are all consistent with the previous RDG analysis. We have concluded that stronger NH⋯X hydrogen bonds may lead to larger red shifts of N–H stretch vibrational frequencies, as can be seen from the comparison of MAPbI-12 and EAPbI-12. However, it was also noticed that for MAPbX-12, although the hydrogen bonds become stronger for systems with more electronegative X, the difference in the shift of the N–H stretch vibrational frequencies is small. Therefore, it may not be suitable to measure the hydrogen bond strength just from the red/blue shift of N–H vibrations.80 It was also observed that the shift in the N–H vibrational frequencies of FAPbI-12 was the smallest, although the NH⋯X bonding strength of FAPbI-12 is similar to those of MAPbI-12 and EAPbI-12.
There is no CH⋯X hydrogen bond in MAPbI-12, two and three in MAPbBr-12 and MAPbCl-12, respectively, and one in EAPbI-12 and FAPbI-12. The CH⋯X hydrogen bonds are much smaller as compared to the NH⋯X bonds, consistent with the smaller variation in C–H vibrational frequency than that of N–H. FAPbI-12 has the strongest CH⋯X hydrogen bond, which is also consistent with the vibrational analysis that the variation of one of the C–H stretches of FAPbI-12 is relatively large.
The sum of hydrogen bond energies, including both NH⋯X and CH⋯X bonds, on one organic cation are 0.26, 0.45, 0.62, 0.37, and 0.47 eV for MAPbX-12 (X = I, Br, and Cl), EAPbI-12, and FAPbI-12, respectively. The calculated value for the NH⋯X hydrogen bond energy of MAPbBr-12 (0.35 eV) is close to the result for the bulk cubic phase MAPbBr3 (0.33 eV),19 which further confirms the reliability of our calculation results. The sums of hydrogen bond energies are 4.36%, 7.53%, 10.43%, 6.21%, and 9.22% of their corresponding binding energy ΔE1, respectively, indicating that although the hydrogen bonds play important roles in the interaction between the organic cations and the BX frameworks, the absolute contribution of hydrogen bonding is not large.

4 Conclusions
In this work, different sizes of cluster models ABX-N (A = organic cations; B = Pb and Sn; X = Cl, Br, and I; N is the number of B atoms) were constructed based on the similarity criterion of the central location environment. In these models, the central site A tends to have a similar chemical environment to that in the bulk perovskite, while the outer A sites are filled with Cs+ to keep the clusters electrically neutral. Several properties were investigated for these clusters with different sizes (with N = 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12) and compared with the corresponding properties of bulk materials, including the binding energy between A and the BX framework, geometric structures (B–X average distances and B–X–B angles), and the electronic structures (HOMO–LUMO gap, the spatial distribution of HOMO and LUMO, electron distribution). As the cluster sizes increase, the changes in these properties tend to converge, and the cluster model with twelve B site atoms (denoted as ABX-12) can properly describe these properties. Therefore, ABX-12 was used as a reliable model to study the properties of perovskite materials with other A-site organic cations, including those with different sizes and different functional groups. The results indicated that MA, EA, and FA with small sizes can form stable quasi-cubic structures, while PA and BA with long carbon chains will cause structural distortions, consistent with the judgment of the tolerance factor of bulk materials. For the stable ones (MAPbX-12 with X = I, Br, and Cl, EAPbI-12, and FAPbI-12), vibrational spectroscopy, reduced density gradient (RDG), and hydrogen bonding strength were calculated to gain detailed insight into the interactions between the A-site cations and the BX framework. The vibrational frequencies of four modes (i.e., the stretching mode of C–N, N–H, C–H, and the torsional mode) of organic cations in different environments were compared, and the results indicate that both the space limitation and the hydrogen bonding interaction can affect the vibrational frequencies. The RDG analysis and hydrogen bond energy estimated from the electronic density at BCP provided consistent results on the strength of the hydrogen bonds of (N)H⋯X and (C)H⋯X. Our work not only provides a reliable cluster model, but also illustrates the application of this model to obtain some valuable microscopic information. Therefore, this work may serve as a good foundation for further research on bulk perovskite materials using cluster models.
