, Accepted 22nd June 2023First published on 23rd June 2023AbstractPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising approach for the conversion of solar energy to hydrogen fuel. However, the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency is still restricted by the kinetically sluggish oxidation reaction on the surface of the photoanode. Herein, a unique composite structure (ZnO@NiO–QDs) was developed as the photoanode, in which the highly dispersed ZnO (d-ZnO) particles derived from the pyrolysis of ZIF-8 serve as the scaffolds to support NiO (cocatalysts) and colloidal CdSe(CdSexS1−x)4(CdS)2 QDs (denoted as CAS, a light absorber). Due to the enhanced hole consumption accelerated by NiO cocatalysts, the optimized photoanode (d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CAS) exhibits a higher saturated current density (Jsc) of 21.7 mA cm−2 than the d-ZnO–CAS photoanode (15.6 mA cm−2) under standard one sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) solar irradiation. More importantly, such an electrode can still work as an electrocatalyst under light-off conditions via a sole electrochemical (EC) process. Thus, a well-designed bifunctional electrode that integrates cocatalysts and light absorbers makes it possible to generate hydrogen efficiently under both light-on and light-off conditions, providing an efficient and low-cost paradigm to improve the hydrogen evolution performance.
Introduction
Solar energy provides a renewable and eco-friendly energy source to meet the increasing demand of global energy and holds the potential to solve the related environmental problems.1–3 Among the related techniques, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a simple and efficient approach to directly convert solar energy to hydrogen, which has become one of the most attractive strategies for the usage and conversion of solar energy.4,5 However, the PEC performance is still far from practical application till now due to the limited light-harvesting capacity, poor charge separation/transfer efficiency and slow reaction kinetics.6,7 To address these issues, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the development of photoactive materials. In the past few decades, metal oxide semiconductors (MOSs), such as TiO2, ZnO, and SnO2, are the most widely investigated semiconductors for PEC hydrogen generation because they are earth-abundant and stable in neutral or basic electrolytes.8–10 However, the light-harvesting capacities of the MOSs are largely restricted by their wide bandgap, which only absorb the photons in the UV region. Recently, colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been regarded as promising light absorbers due to their unique optical/electrical characteristics.11,12 In this case, the QD-sensitized MOSs could effectively broaden the light absorption range to the visible region or even the near-infrared region (NIR) in comparison with pure MOSs. Simultaneously, an appropriate band alignment between QDs and MOSs would also provide a possibility for the improvement of the charge separation/transfer efficiency.
Although encouraging improvements in solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion have been achieved, the PEC performance is still restrained by the thermodynamically uphill reaction that requires the participation of multiple electrons.13–15 To solve this issue, surface modification by loading appropriate cocatalysts, such as FeOOH, NiO, cobalt–phosphate (Co–Pi), and RuO2, has been a feasible approach to enhance the PEC performance.16–18 For example, Liao et al.19 employed Co3O4 nanoparticles as oxidation catalysts to construct a Co3O4/Ta3N5 photoanode for the application of PEC water splitting. Benefiting from the Co3O4 that helps to release photogenerated holes accumulated on the Ta3N5 surface, the Co3O4/Ta3N5 photoanode achieves a twice higher photocurrent density than the bare Ta3N5 photoanode. Similarly, Zhong et al.20 proposed a NiO/CoOx dual catalyst strategy for high PEC performances, in which the NiO/CoOx/BiVO4 photoanode exhibited a higher performance compared to the CoOx/BiVO4 photoanode and bare BiVO4 photoanode. Moreover, the photogenerated holes could be accumulated on the surface of metal sulfides (e.g., CdS and CdSe) before being consumed by electron donors. In this case, the hole-driven photocorrosion in metal sulfides would take place irreversibly, leading to the oxidation of surface sulfide ions (S2−) to sulfur (S0) and/or sulfate (SO42−).21,22 Accordingly, the employment of cocatalysts that can accelerate the consumption of photogenerated holes is an effective strategy to improve the stability of PEC devices. However, these cocatalysts were usually loaded on the surface of light absorbers through a complex deposition process, which might affect the light-harvesting capacity and charge transfer/separation efficiency of a PEC device.23 Therefore, highly dispersed cocatalysts are essential to the PEC performance.
Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely investigated due to their structural tenability, large specific surface areas and pore-tunable properties.24,25 Unfortunately, the poor conductivity and weak stability of MOFs have restricted their application in the field of electro-/photo-catalysis.26 To overcome these limitations, MOFs could be employed as sacrificial templates to synthesize targeted MOSs, while retaining a certain porous structure via controllable pyrolysis.27,28 In this case, the porous MOSs show potential for providing large surface area to load the cocatalysts and light absorbers. Among various MOFs, ZIF-8 can be an ideal platform for fabricating porous scaffolds to load other light absorbers and cocatalysts due to its low cost as well as its controllable size/morphology.29,30 Based on the issue of the wide bandgap (3.2 eV) of the pyrolysis-obtained ZnO which can only absorb photons in the UV region, extra light harvesters are necessary to be involved for more efficient usage of the solar spectrum. Benefitting from the porous structure and large surface area, such MOF scaffolds provide an opportunity for improved dispersion of cocatalysts/light absorbers.
Herein, we first pyrolyzed the ZIF-8 precursors in air and obtained the agglomerated ZnO (a-ZnO) particles. Through mixing with Ni precursors using the molten salt method (MSM), the a-ZnO particles were separated to form dispersed ZnO (d-ZnO) particles, and simultaneously Ni2+ ions will be anchored on the d-ZnO (d-ZnO–Nix) surface by virtue of the strong polarization effect of molten salt. To construct the photoanode, the obtained d-ZnO–Nix was deposited on FTO and subsequently annealed in air to form a robust scaffold film (d-ZnO@NiOx). Then, the colloidal QDs were deposited onto the ZnO@NiO electrode for fabricating the d-ZnO@NiO–QD photoanode via the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method. By varying the ratio of NiO cocatalysts, d-ZnO@NiO0.03 can achieve fascinating surface reaction without hindering the light absorption and charge transfer of the QDs. Furthermore, based on the CdSe(CdSexS1−x)4(CdS)2 QDs (denoted as CAS), the optimized photoanode (d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CAS) exhibits the highest saturated current density (Jsc) of 21.7 mA cm−2 under standard one sun (AM 1.5 G) solar irradiation among the PEC devices sensitized with different QDs. Meanwhile, the designed electrode can also produce hydrogen without light illumination via an electrochemical (EC) process. Thus, the design of the ZnO@NiOx–QDs electrode with such a unique composite structure holds potential for producing hydrogen efficiently under both light-on and light-off conditions.
Results and discussion
Fig. 1a illustrates the synthetic procedures from the ZIF-8 precursors to d-ZnO–Nix via two-step treatments. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images in Fig. 1b and X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Fig. S1† show that the typical ZIF-8 was synthesized and exhibits a well-defined polyhedron morphology. Then, the obtained ZIF-8 transformed into ZnO after the high-temperature pyrolysis treatment in air, as revealed by the XRD results (Fig. S2†). The SEM images presented in Fig. 1c show that these ZnO particles agglomerated together but maintained the polyhedron morphology of the ZIF-8 precursor, which is denoted as a-ZnO. Clearly, a-ZnO exhibits a shrunken size and a rougher surface in comparison with the original ZIF-8, which could be attributed to the loss of organic ligands during pyrolysis.31 Furthermore, the molten-salt-mediated (MSM) method was applied for the treatment of a-ZnO by heating the mixture of the a-ZnO, molten salt (LiCl and KCl) and Ni precursors (NiCl2·6H2O) at 500 °C for 2 hours under vacuum (Fig. S3†). Due to the strong polarization effect of the molten salt, the surfaces of agglomerated ZnO become metastable and the interactions between ZnO particles were significantly reduced, leading to the formation of highly dispersed ZnO nanoparticles (d-ZnO) with a quasi-spherical shape (Fig. 1d). Meanwhile, as suggested by the previously reported studies,32 the free-moving Ni2+ ions will be anchored on the d-ZnO surface through bonding with the surface oxygen ions (as illustrated in Fig. S4†). The XRD pattern in Fig. S5† shows that no obvious diffraction peaks corresponding to Ni-related species can be observed, indicating that these Ni ions might be highly dispersed on the d-ZnO surface.

To construct the photoanode, the obtained composite (d-ZnO–Nix) was deposited on FTO and then annealed in air to form a robust scaffold film. As shown in Fig. 2a, except for the diffraction peaks of ZnO, an additional peak at 43.30° could be ascribed to the (200) plane of NiO (JCPDS no. 71-1179). This result indicates the formation of NiO species on the ZnO surface (d-ZnO@NiO0.03), and the low intensity of the corresponding diffraction peak is mainly due to the low atomic ratio of Ni/Zn (Table S1†). The transmission electron microscope (TEM) image (Fig. 2b) shows that d-ZnO@NiO consists of spherical-like nanoparticles. The inset of the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image presents a crystal plane spacing of 2.48 Å corresponding to the (101) plane of ZnO, which matches well with the XRD analysis. Furthermore, the high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image (Fig. 2c), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping (Fig. 2d–f) and EDX spectrum (Fig. S6†) of d-ZnO@NiO reveal the uniform dispersion of NiO species on the d-ZnO surface without obvious agglomeration. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were further conducted to probe the oxidation state of Ni and Zn within d-ZnO@NiO0.03. As shown in Fig. 2g, binding energies of peaks at 855.7 and 873.8 eV are assigned to the Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 of Ni2+, accompanied by two prominent shakeup satellite peaks (861.8 and 879.5 eV).33 The peaks in the Zn 2p spectrum (Fig. S7a†) can be assigned to the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 of Zn(II)34 and the O 1s spectra (Fig. S7b†) can be fitted to O2− species35 in the lattice (OL), vacancy oxygen (OV) and surface-adsorbed hydroxyl groups (OC). Furthermore, both the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum (Fig. 2h) and Fourier-transformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum (Fig. 2i) of Ni in d-ZnO@NiO0.03 show almost the same profile as those of the NiO reference, confirming that the Ni atoms are dispersed on the ZnO surface in the form of NiO. These results reveal the in situ growth of NiO on the d-ZnO surface when d-ZnO@Nix was exposed to oxygen at high temperature. Furthermore, we found that the increasing amount of Ni precursor would lead to the agglomeration of NiO on the d-ZnO surface (Fig. S8†), along with the enhanced intensity of the XRD peak at 43.30° (Fig. S9†).

To enhance the sunlight-harvesting capacity of d-ZnO@NiO, the core–shell CdSe(CdS)6 QDs (denoted as CS QDs) were utilized as the light absorbers. In Fig. 3a, the TEM image shows that the CS QDs present a regular quasi-spherical shape, and the size distribution curve in Fig. 3b shows that CS QDs have a uniform size (∼6.6 nm). The HRTEM image of CS QDs (Fig. 3c) displays a lattice spacing of 3.40 Å indexed to the (002) plane of wurtzite (WZ) CdS. To further optimize the PEC hydrogen generation performance, we applied CdSe(CdSexS1−x)4(CdS)2 QDs (denoted as CAS) with gradient interfacial layers as light absorbers to substitute CS QDs. The TEM image (Fig. 3d) shows that the CAS QDs have a regular quasi-spherical shape with an average diameter of 6.9 nm (Fig. 3e), and the increased size of CAS QDs could be attributed to the larger size of Se atoms in the shell. Similarly, the HRTEM image in Fig. 3f displays a slightly increased lattice spacing of 3.42 Å indexed to the (002) plane of wurtzite (WZ) CdS. The XRD results further reveal the crystal structure of CS QDs and CAS QDs. As shown in Fig. 3g, a series of wide diffraction peaks for both CS QDs and CAS QDs appear between those for ZB-phase CdSe and WZ-phase CdS, confirming the coexistence of ZB-phase CdSe and WZ-phase CdS in CS QDs and CAS QDs. These results are consistent with the previously reported epitaxial growth of the CdSe(CdS) core/shell system.36,37 Then, the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 3h) shows that the CS QDs and CAS QDs exhibit a typical first-excitonic peak at 602 nm and 606 nm, respectively. Notably, the CAS QDs exhibit a wider light-harvesting range and enhanced light-absorption capacity. In addition, the photoluminescence (PL) peak of CS QDs (∼612 nm) and CAS QDs (∼620 nm) exhibits an insignificant Stokes shift of 10 nm (∼0.03 eV) and 14 nm (∼0.05 eV), suggesting that these emission peaks originate from the band edge rather than trap-related emission (Fig. 3i). In fact, the absence of a trap emission route is beneficial for the photo-to-current conversion efficiency in PEC cells due to the decrease in charge recombination.38,39 Hence, the d-ZnO@NiO photoanodes sensitized by CS QDs (d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS) are promising for the enhancement of PEC hydrogen generation. Moreover, according to previous research,40,41 the well-designed CAS QDs with alloyed interfacial layers can reduce the lattice mismatch and provide a favorable band structure between the CdSe core and CdS shell, thus benefiting charge separation and transfer. Therefore, it holds potential to further optimize the PEC hydrogen generation performance by substituting CS QDs with CAS QDs.

Performance tests
Then, the PEC performance of d-ZnO@NiO–CS photoanodes was evaluated by using a typical three-electrode system (Fig. 4a), in which the QDs were deposited onto the d-ZnO@NiO film through the EPD method. As displayed in Fig. 4b, under light-on conditions, d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS exhibits a Jsc of 14.9 mA cm−2, which is higher than that of d-ZnO@CS (8.8 mA cm−2) and d-ZnO@NiO0.03 (4.6 mA cm−2), revealing that the integration of CS QDs (light absorber) and NiO (cocatalysts) can significantly improve the PEC performance. Under light-off conditions, the current density of d-ZnO@CS decreases to a negligible value, while d-ZnO@NiO0.03 and d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS can still exhibit a promising current density, which is presumably due to the electrocatalytic contribution of NiO.

(b) Current density–potential (J–V) of the d-ZnO@NiO0.03, d-ZnO@CS, and d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS electrodes under the light on and light off conditions.

(f) Theoretical/experimental H2 evolution d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS and d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CAS electrodes. 
Then, we further investigated the effect of the NiO amount (Table S1†) on the performance of d-ZnO@NiOx–CS photoanodes. Fig. 4c shows that as the atomic ratio of Ni/Zn increases from 0.03 to 0.09, the current density under light-off conditions remains almost unchanged while the current density under light-on conditions decreases significantly. As discussed previously, the high atomic ratio of Ni/Zn would lead to the agglomeration of dispersed NiO into larger particles, which is deduced to decrease the light-harvesting efficiency of CS QDs and related hydrogen generation performance. On the other hand, based on the same CdSe core (Fig. S10 and S11†), we applied the CAS QDs to replace the CS, as the former usually manifest higher light-absorbing capacity and charge separation/transfer efficiency. Obviously, the d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CAS photoanode exhibits a much higher Jsc (21.7 mA cm−2) (Fig. 4d) in comparison with the ZnO@NiO0.03–CS photoanode (14.9 mA cm−2) and previous report (Table S2†).
Additionally, the J–t curves of d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS and d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CAS photoanodes (Fig. 4e) indicate a good stability under both light-on and light-off conditions. Moreover, the transient current test of the d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS photoanode under chopped illumination (Fig. S12†) further implies the comparable PEC response and good EC performance (under light-off conditions).The faradaic efficiency (FE) of d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS and d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CAS with cocatalysts and light absorbers was further analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4f, after 90 minutes, 9.1 mL of hydrogen was produced for d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CAS devices under light-on conditions, while 5.1 mL of hydrogen was produced under light-on conditions and 2.7 mL of hydrogen was produced under light-off conditions for d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS devices. Furthermore, the theoretical amount of H2 generated from the photoanode was calculated from the current. After calculation, the faradaic efficiency was estimated to be ∼65% (light-on) and ∼70% (light-off).
Effects of NiO cocatalysts on the EC process
To deeply understand the electrocatalytic process of NiO cocatalysts, we conducted the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements for d-ZnO and d-ZnO@NiO0.03. First, in the case of NaOH (adjusted to pH ∼ 13) solution used as the electrolyte, the CV curve of the d-ZnO@NiO0.03 electrode (Fig. 5a) only shows an obvious redox peak (1.2–1.5 V vs. RHE) belonging to nickel species, which was not observed in that of the d-ZnO electrode (Fig. 5b). Notably, the CV curves of the ZnO electrode and d-ZnO@NiO0.03 electrode under light-on conditions share a similar profile with those under light-off conditions, suggesting that ZnO and d-ZnO@NiO0.03 might be less active in NaOH solution. This could be attributed to the fact that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in NaOH electrolyte requires a four-electron four-proton coupled reaction and related kinetics are relatively sluggish. Interestingly, when the S2−/SO32− (pH ∼ 13) solution was used as the electrolyte, the d-ZnO@NiO0.03 electrode (Fig. 5c) shows an apparent oxidation current under light-off conditions and a further increased current under light-on conditions. In this case, the SO32− and S2− can be easily oxidized to SO42−. In contrast, the ZnO electrode (Fig. 5d) shows a negligible oxidation current under light-off conditions but a slightly increased current under light-on conditions. These results imply that NiO cocatalysts are essential for catalyzing the electrochemical oxidation reaction involved in S2−/SO32− solution. We further performed CV tests for d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS and ZnO@NiO0.03–CAS (Fig. S13†), and the results show that both of them have an enhanced response for hydrogen generation under light-on and light-off conditions.

Effects of NiO cocatalysts and CAS QDs on the PEC process
Furthermore, we investigated the effects of NiO cocatalysts on charge dynamics for the d-ZnO–QDs, d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS and d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CAS photoanodes. To analyze the charge transfer dynamics, the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) measurements were performed to obtain the lifetime of QDs on d-ZnO, d-ZnO@NiO0.03 and a ZrO2 mesoporous film (Fig. 6a and b). The average electron lifetime 〈τ〉 can be calculated through fitting the PL decay curves with the following eqn (1):39,42 
(1)where τ1, τ2, and τ3 are the typical lifetimes and α1, α2, and α3 are the coefficients of fitting of the PL decay curves, respectively. Here, because the high energy band offset between ZrO2 and QDs would inhibit electron transfer, ZrO2 can be used as a benchmark to determine the electron transfer rate (Ket) using eqn (2).31,43 
(2)where τ(d-QDs/ZnO or d-ZnO@NiO0.03) and τ(QDs/ZrO2) are the average PL lifetimes for QDs deposited on d-ZnO or d-ZnO@NiO0.03 and ZrO2, respectively.

(c) OCVD spectra of the d-ZnO, d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS and d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CAS photoanodes; (d) Nyquist plot of the d-ZnO, d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS and d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CAS photoanodes. (The equivalent circuit model is shown in the inset). 
The average 〈τ〉 and calculated Ket of various QDs on different films are summarized in Table 1. Apparently, d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS exhibits a higher Ket than d-ZnO@CS, which indicates the effective charge transfer via the fast consumption of photogenerated holes within NiO. Moreover, when the CS QDs are substituted by CAS QDs, d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS shows a higher Ket in comparison with that of d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS. This is mainly due to the fact that CAS QDs with alloyed interfacial layers can minimize the lattice mismatch and provide a gradient band structure between the CdSe core and CdS shell, contributing to efficient charge separation and transfer.

Moreover, open circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD) measurements are an effective tool to investigate charge recombination and separation. According to the principle of OCVD, the equilibrium is first established between electron accumulation and loss under open circuit and constant illumination conditions. Then, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) tends to decline after light off due to charge recombination. Fig. 6c shows that compared to the d-ZnO@CS photoanode, the Voc of the d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS photoanode decays at a lower rate. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that NiO cocatalysts suppress charge recombination by accelerating the consumption of holes in the electrochemical process. More importantly, the d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CAS photoanode exhibits a lower Voc decay rate in comparison with the d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS photoanode. This is mainly attributed to the more efficient charge separation and transfer of CAS QDs with alloyed interfacial layers.
Furthermore, we conducted the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements to analyze the charge transfer behaviors of the obtained photoanodes. According to the Randles–Ershler model, the EIS data of the d-ZnO–QD and d-ZnO@NiO0.03–QDs photoanodes were presented in the form of Nyquist plots (Fig. 6d). The related equivalent circuit for simulation is shown in the inset, where Rct, Rs and CPE represent the charge transfer resistance of the photoanode/electrolyte interface, electrolyte resistance and the capacitance phase element, respectively.44 Clearly, the charge transfer resistance of d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CAS is much lower than that of d-ZnO@–CS and d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS. As shown in the simulated results (Table S3†), the d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CS photoanode exhibits a much lower Rct (367 Ω) than the d-ZnO@CS photoanode (776 Ω). It is obvious that the interfacial charge transfer between the photoanode and electrolyte has been remarkably improved. This is mainly because NiO cocatalysts can accelerate the consumption of the holes and promote electron transfer, indicating the important role of NiO cocatalysts. Notably, when the CS QDs were substituted by CAS QDs, the d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CAS photoanode exhibits the lowest Rct (272 Ω) among all three kinds of photoanodes, suggesting that the utilization of CAS QDs can further facilitate charge separation and transfer.
To better analyze the mechanism of charge transfer in the ZnO integrated with NiO and QD photoanode, we further performed the UV-vis absorption spectrum measurements to calculate the energy bandgaps of d-ZnO and QDs according to the classical Tauc's formula, and conducted UPS measurements to estimate the band edge positions of d-ZnO and QDs. The detailed data are presented in Fig. S14–S21,† and the results are summarized in Fig. 7. As the NiO cocatalysts have an insignificant effect on the band structure of d-ZnO, the QDs and d-ZnO form a type II heterojunction, in which the cascade band structure could facilitate charge separation and transfer. Additionally, previous research studies have confirmed that NiO is an effective oxidation cocatalyst.45–48 Therefore, in this work, the NiO cocatalyst could act as active sites to catalyze the oxidation of S2− and SO32− with the consumption of holes. These results are well consistent with the above charge transfer analysis, and confirmed the potential of integrating light absorbers with cocatalysts for improving the hydrogen generation performance.

Based on the above experimental results, we could conclude that (i) under light-off conditions, NiO cocatalysts predominately contribute to hydrogen generation via an extra EC process involving the oxidation reaction of S2−/SO32−. Simultaneously, the electrons will be transferred to the Pt electrode for hydrogen generation; (ii) under light-on conditions, a synergetic effect of the EC and PEC process of both NiO and QDs would contribute to hydrogen generation. (iii) an appropriate loading amount of NiO cocatalysts is essential for promoting the surface reaction of the photoanode, thus leading to improved charge separation and transfer efficiency; (iv) the optimized QDs with gradient interfacial layers could further improve the hydrogen generation performance through enhancing the charge separation and transfer.
Conclusions
In summary, a novel PEC electrode based on MOF-derived porous ZnO integrated with NiO and QDs was developed. By optimizing the content of NiO cocatalysts and the types of QDs, the d-ZnO@NiO0.03–CAS electrode exhibits an excellent hydrogen generation performance with a Jsc of 21.7 mA cm−2 under standard AM 1.5 G solar irradiation. The synergistic PEC and EC process plays a critical role in improving the hydrogen generation performance. Typically, QDs will enhance the light-harvesting capacity of the photoanode for generating electron–hole pairs in the PEC process, while the EC process driven by NiO cocatalysts not only improves the overall PEC efficiency but also makes it possible to produce hydrogen under light-off conditions. Our findings provide a novel strategy to improve the efficiency of hydrogen generation, paving the way for the investigation of other bifunctional catalysts for both photoelectrochemical and electrochemical reactions.

Preparation of ZIF-8, a-ZnO, and d-ZnO–Nix
Preparation of ZIF-8. ZIF-8 was synthesized according to the previous report with a minor modification.49,50 In a typical process, 3.25 g of 2-methylimidazole was dissolved fully in methanol solution with stirring (∼700 rpm). Then, 3 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was added to the above solution. When the clear precursor solutions started to turn milky white, the stirring speed was reduced to ∼100 rpm and the reaction mixture was left stirring for 24 hours. The white powders were collected by centrifugation and purified with methanol at least three times. Finally, the as-synthesized ZIF-8 crystals were dried at 60 °C under vacuum overnight.
Preparation of a-ZnO. To synthesize porous ZnO, 1.0 g of the as-prepared ZIF-8 was annealed at 500 °C in a muffle furnace for 4 hours under an air atmosphere at a ramp rate of 4 °C min−1. After natural cooling, the pale white powder of agglomerated ZnO (named a-ZnO) was obtained.
Preparation of d-ZnO–Nix. ZnO anchored with Ni2+ was prepared through a modified molten-salt method (MSM). By varying the addition of the nickel precursor, dispersed ZnO nanoparticles with different amounts of Ni were acquired (named d-ZnO–Nix), where x represents the molar ratio of Ni/Zn. In a typical process, 0.3 mmol of NiCl2·6H2O, 1.8 g of LiCl, 2.2 g of KCl and 0.01 mol of ZnO particles were ground in a mortar and pestle for 30 minutes to make a uniform mixture, which was then transferred into a semi-capped corundum crucible. Next, the crucible was placed in a tube furnace and calcined at 500 °C for 2 hours under vacuum (heating rate: 5 °C min−1). After cooling down to room temperature naturally, the mixture was washed with water thoroughly five times to remove the salt (LiCl & KCl), and the obtained d-ZnO–Ni0.03 was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C.
Preparation of the d-ZnO@NiOx film
Preparation of d-ZnO–Nix paste. Typically, d-ZnO–Nix was mixed with 5 mL ethanol as a solvent, 1.0 mL alpha-terpineol (dispersant), 0.5 g ethyl cellulose (thickener), and 1.0 mL of water. Then the mixture was stirred overnight to obtain a homogeneous solution. Additionally, the solvent was removed under vacuum and continuous magnetic stirring. Finally, the d-ZnO–Nix paste was obtained while the volume of the mixture was reduced to less than half of the initial volume.
Preparation of the d-ZnO@NiOx film. FTO glass substrates were cleaned ultrasonically for 30 minutes with acetone, ethanol, and de-ionized (DI) water, respectively, and finally dried in a N2 gaseous flow. For the preparation of uniform and controllable films, the doctor blade technique was applied. Briefly, the d-ZnO–Nix paste was deposited onto FTO substrates and kept in air for 8 minutes to completely spread out. The electrodes were subsequently dried at 120 °C for 10 minutes. Then, a repeated procedure was conducted to make 20 μm thick films. Finally, the electrodes were annealed in air at 500 °C for 30 minutes to fully remove organic ingredients and form porous d-ZnO@NiOx films. Similarly, x represents the molar ratio of Ni/Zn precursors.
Preparation of QDs
Preparation of CdSe QDs. CdSe QDs were synthesized by using the hot injection approach.51,52 Typically, TOPO (1.5 g) and Cd-oleate (0.76 mmol, 1 mL) in 11 mL of ODE were purged with N2 at room temperature for 30 minutes. The reaction system was evacuated for 30 minutes at 110 °C, and then the temperature was raised to 300 °C. At this temperature, a selenium solution made by dissolving 8 mmol of Se in 6 mL of TOP and further diluting with 2 mL of ODE and 4 mL OLA was quickly injected. The reaction cell was quenched with cold water after injection. Ethanol (30 mL) was added and then the suspension was centrifuged. Finally, the supernatant was removed and the CdSe QDs were re-dispersed in toluene for further use.
Preparation of injection solutions. Prior to the deposition of shell layers on CdSe QDs, the injection solutions were prepared according to previous studies with a little modification.53,54 The cation injection solution (Cd-oleate, 0.2 M) was prepared by dissolving CdO (6 mmol) in oleic acid (8.5 mL) and ODE (21.5 mL) at 250 °C. Anion solution (0.2 M) was prepared by dissolving the selenium/sulfur mixture or sulfur in ODE at 200 °C. The Se/S injection solutions with a gradient ratio (Table S4†) were used for the growth of the alloyed shells.
Preparation of core/shell QDs and core/alloyed shell/shell QDs. The successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR)37,55 was applied for the shell growth. For a typical reaction, in a 100 mL round-bottom flask, OLA (12.5 mL), ODE (12.5 mL), and CdSe QDs (∼2 × 107 mol in toluene) were degassed at 110 °C for 60 minutes. After sufficient removal of water, oxygen, and toluene, the temperature was further raised to 240 °C under a N2 flow. The complete cycle of a single layer of shell growth includes two steps: Cd-oleate (0.2 M) was added dropwise, and the mixture was allowed to react for 2.5 hours. Then, 0.2 M S–ODE was added with the same volume and further annealed for 30 minutes. Six layers were grown on the CdSe core as a shell. The addition volumes of cation solution and anion solution for shell growth cycles 1–6 were as follows: 0.36, 0.50, 0.67, 0.86, 1.07, and 1.31 mL, respectively. The reaction was terminated by allowing the reaction mixture to cool to room temperature. Then ethanol was added, and the suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. The final product was purified by dissolving the QDs in toluene and precipitating them with acetone several times. The QDs were then dispersed in toluene for further use and characterization. By varying the addition of anion solution (Table S4†), two kinds of QDs were prepared. The obtained CdSe(CdS)6 QDs (pure CdS as the shell) were denoted as CS QDs. Similarly, the obtained CdSe(CdSexS1−x)4(CdS)2 QDs (gradient CdSexS1−x as the interfacial alloyed shell) were denoted as CAS QDs.
Preparation of the d-ZnO@NiOx–QD electrode
The as-prepared d-ZnO@NiO films on FTO substrates were vertically immersed in a QD dispersion. The distance between them was adjusted to be around 0.5 cm and a direct current (DC) bias of 200 V was applied for 120 minutes. To wash off unabsorbed QDs after the EPD process, the samples were rinsed several times with toluene and dried with a N2 flow at room temperature. Prior to ZnS capping, the ligand exchange was applied by using two SILAR cycles of methanolic solution cetyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and methanol for 1 minute dipping. The ZnS capping layer was grown using a two cycle SILAR process. Specifically, a single SILAR cycle consisted of 1 minute dip-coating of the photoanode in the cation precursors (Zn2+) and subsequently in the anion solutions (S2−).
Characterization
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy of QD solution was recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of QD solution were obtained on a fluorescence spectrometer (NIR-VIS, FL3) with excitation at 400 nm. Using a 455 nm laser in the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) mode, the lifetime of QDs was determined. The Ni content in d-ZnO@NiOx was determined by using an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Avio 200). The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests for MOFs and MOSs were conducted on a PANalytical X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The XRD patterns for QDs were recorded using a Bruker D8 powder X-ray diffractometer (Germany) with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) tests for MOFs and MOSs were performed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Zeiss G500). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) characterization experiments were conducted on an FEI Tecnai TF20; high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping characterization were conducted on a TALOS 200X transmission electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Ultraviolet photo-electron spectroscopy (UPS) data were collected on a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD with He I radiation (21.21 eV). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD) using a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source with a power of 96 W (12 kV and 8 mA). All samples were tested under a pressure of less than 3.0 × 10−9 torr and all the XPS spectra were corrected based on the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV of adsorbed carbon. The spectra were analyzed using a Casa XPS Casaware (Version 2.3.16 PR 1.6). Ni K-edge X-ray absorption spectrum (XAS) measurements were performed at the BL14W1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF),56 operating at 3.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA. XAS data were collected in fluorescence mode using a fixed-exit double-crystal Si (111) monochromator and the obtained data were processed by utilizing the ATHENA module of the IFEFFIT software packages.57
Evaluation of PEC performance
All the PEC measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760) in a three-electrode system. The as-prepared photoanode, Pt wire, and standard Ag/AgCl electrode serve as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. The potential during the measurement was converted to the RHE scale according to eqn (3): 
VRHE = VAg/AgCl + 0.197 + pH × 0.05
(3)
An aqueous solution of 0.25 M Na2S/0.35 M Na2SO3 (pH ∼ 13) was used as an electrolyte and sacrificial reagent. A xenon high brightness cold light source (XD300) equipped with an AM 1.5 filter was used as the irradiation source with a light intensity of about 100 mW cm−2 estimated with a radiometer. The working area of the photoanode was about 0.12 cm2 with the left part covered by nonconductive Hysol epoxy. The sample was placed at a distance of 20 cm from the center of the sun simulator. The LSV test was performed from −1.4 V to 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 for 3 cycles. The CV test was performed from −1.4 V to 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 for 2 cycles.
H2 evolution was analyzed by using a gas chromatograph (Techcomp GC-7900) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Nitrogen (N2) was used as the carrier gas. 0.6 mL of the gas sample was taken out from the sealed chamber of the PEC system by using an air-tight syringe, at a time interval of 30 minutes, and injected into the GC. The obtained data were compared and analyzed by the external standard method. The faradaic efficiency was calculated by using the following eqn (4):58
