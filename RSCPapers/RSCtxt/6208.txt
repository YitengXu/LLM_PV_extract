    , Accepted 20th May 2022First published on 21st May 2022AbstractAiming to regulate crystallization and reduce defects of perovskite films, an organic small molecule with sulfonyl, 3-ethylbenzo[d]isothiazole 1,1-dioxide (PSAD), is introduced into perovskite precursor solution. A variety of characterization studies (nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectra) and density functional theory calculations are conducted to reveal the hydrogen bonding and coordination interactions between PSAD and perovskite. As a result, a perovskite film with large grains and reduced defects is obtained, along with the lessened non-radiation recombination, decreasing hole extraction energy loss, and ameliorative electron extraction. All these efficacies contribute to the enhanced efficiency and stability of the PSAD-treated devices. Our chemical strategy can help to explore the mechanism behind passivation to improve perovskite photovoltaics.
Introduction
In the last decade, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been widely investigated because of their simple preparation technologies and high record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs),1–7 which are mainly attributed to the excellent photoelectric properties of perovskites themselves, including large carrier mobility,8 high light absorption coefficient,9 direct/adjustable band gap and so on.10 Typically, polycrystalline perovskite films are obtained by one-step spin-coating and a subsequent annealing process,3 with defects generated within the grains (due to internal defects and impurities) and at grain boundaries/surfaces (resulting from hanging bonds, organic component evaporation, ion migration, etc.).11–16 It is well known that the trap density of polycrystalline perovskite film is in the order of 1014 to 1017 cm−1,17 while that of the perovskite single-crystal grain is in the order of 1010 to 1014 cm−1.8 That means most of the defects are distributed in the grain boundaries, which will cause charge recombination and thus reduce the device performance. Meanwhile, the defects at the grain boundaries are thought to be channels for water and oxygen to invade, thus reducing the stability of perovskite grains.18,19 Therefore, defect passivation is an important strategy to improve device efficiency and long-term stability.
The introduction of additives is an effective way to regulate the morphology and to passivate defects of perovskite films.20–24 Additive engineering has been extensively used in PSCs,25 mainly including Lewis acids/bases,26 fullerene derivatives,27 ammonium salts,28 metal cationic compounds,29 ionic liquids,30etc. For example, Ahn et al. took advantage of a Lewis base, N,N-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), to bind Lewis acid PbI2 to form an adduct of MAI·PbI2·DMSO via coordination interactions.31 The adduct-induced perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) exhibited high hole mobility and large charge extraction capacity and the resultant devices showed outstanding PCEs. Du et al. introduced an ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([EMIM]+[HSO4]−), into perovskite (CsPb(I,Br)3) precursor solution to fabricate high-quality films with few defects and an appropriate interfacial energy alignment.32 They claimed that there are strong coordination interactions between [EMIM]+[HSO4]− and under-coordinated Pb2+, which can effectively passivate the iodine vacancies and reduce the trap density in perovskite films. Besides, the interfacial passivation between the carrier transport layer and perovskite layer is also a proven significant strategy to reduce defect density and improve interface contact.33–35 Nevertheless, the essence of these passivations is intermolecular/interionic interactions,36 through which additives bind specific defects in perovskites, regulating carrier dynamics and improving charge recombination, thus improving device performance.
Herein, we introduced an organic small molecule with sulfonyl, 3-ethylbenzo[d]isothiazole 1,1-dioxide (PSAD) into perovskite precursor solution. Oxygen atoms with lone-pair electrons can bind uncoordinated lead ions through coordination interactions, and meanwhile, bind with N–H from organic components (CH(NH)2+, FA+) via hydrogen bonding. The morphology and photophysical properties of the PSAD-treated perovskite film and charge carrier dynamics in the resultant devices are systematically investigated. It is found that the introduction of PSAD can significantly reduce defects, lessen charge non-radiation recombination, and thus, improve the photovoltaic performance of the resultant devices. The PSAD-treated devices exhibit a high PCE of 23.85% (21.46% for the control device) as well as better operational stability at maximum power point (MPP) tracking.
Results and discussion
We first explored the effect of PSAD on the microstructure of the perovskite films. The addition amount of PSAD was optimized according to the device performance parameters and only the optimal concentration of PSAD was used to conduct the following characterization studies. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the surface morphology of the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 1a and b, both perovskite films are evenly and completely covering the FTO substrates. However, the perovskite grains become larger after the introduction of PSAD, which is confirmed by the grain size statistic as shown in Fig. S1.†Fig. 1c and d show the cross-sectional SEM images of PSCs with/without PSAD-treatment. The perovskite grains not only became larger laterally but also the grains were intact vertically possibly resulting from the enhanced solution viscosity because of the introduction of PSAD, indicating the effective carrier transport without traversing grain boundaries.37 Fig. S2† shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the perovskite films with/without PSAD. Both perovskite films exhibit similar patterns and no new peaks appear for PSAD-treated film (Fig. S2†). After the introduction of PSAD, the intensity of the main peak at ∼14° (110 diffraction plane) increases, and its full width at half maximum (FWHM) drops from 0.1380 to 0.1265, indicating the improved crystallinity of the perovskite film with the addition of PSAD.

The interactions between PSAD and perovskite were then to be investigated. 1H NMR spectroscopy was first carried out on FAI with/without PSAD. We can see from Fig. 2a that the –NH2 peak at 8.76 ppm in FAI is split into two peaks at 8.64 ppm and 8.99 ppm after the addition of PSAD. FTIR was also used to study the interactions between PSAD and FAI. As shown in Fig. 2b, the N–H stretching vibration peak around 3353 cm−1 in an FAI film moves to a lower wavenumber of 3336 cm−1 in the FAI + PSAD film. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed to further investigate the interactions between PSAD and perovskite. We can see from Fig. 2c that the binding energy of the N 1s peak is at 400.75 eV for the control perovskite film, while it moves to 400.48 eV after the addition of PSAD. All above characterization studies indicate the generation of hydrogen bonding interactions (N–H⋯O) between PSAD and perovskite. We also conducted FTIR measurements for MAI and MAI + PSAD. We can see from Fig. S3† that there is a little shift in MAI for the N–H stretching vibration peak (from 3449.09 to 3441.35 cm−1) after the introduction of PSAD, which confirms the formation of hydrogen bonding between MA and PSAD. This was also supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As shown in Fig. 2d, the calculated interaction energy of hydrogen bonds (EH-bond) between PSAD and FAI was −34.02 kcal mol−1. In Fig. 2e, we observed that the asymmetric stretching vibration peak of SO at around 1331.1 cm−1 in the PSAD film moves to a higher wavenumber of 1317.6 cm−1 in the PbI2 + PSAD film. Additionally, the binding energy peaks of Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 shift from 143.4 eV and 138.55 eV for pristine perovskite to 143.05 eV and 138.2 eV after the addition of PSAD (Fig. 2f), which confirms the coordination interaction between –SO2– in PSAD and Pb2+ in perovskite and is also indicated by FTIR. DFT calculations showed the interaction energy (Eint) of −147.18 kcal mol−1 between PSAD and Pb2+ as shown in Fig. 2g, confirming that the coordination interactions were responsible for the shift in the Pb signals in the XPS spectra. The schematic illustration of the interaction mechanism between PASD and perovskite is shown in Fig. 2h.

Conventional devices with a configuration of FTO/compact TiO2 (c-TiO2)/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au were assembled to assess the effect of PSAD on device performance.38 The optimal amount of PSAD was confirmed by the performance of devices with different concentrations of PSAD treatment as shown in Fig. S4† and the corresponding data are summarized in Table S1.†Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the companion devices with/without PSAD treatment. The PSAD-treated companion device shows an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.153 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 25.33 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.816, and a PCE of 23.85%, compared with the control device with a VOC of 1.108 V, a JSC of 24.62 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.786, and a PCE of 21.46%.

(c)–(f) Performance statistics of the parameters of devices based on perovskite films with/without PSAD. 
The hysteresis index (HI) can be obtained by using the following formula:  The HI of the PSAD-treated device is 0.104 compared with that (0.181) of the control device, resulting from the passivation of PSAD on the perovskite film. Fig. 3b shows a stable photocurrent output with the bias at the maximum power point for 100 s, indicating that both devices with/without PSAD show high stability and reliability. Fig. 3c–f and Table 1 show the performance statistics of the devices with/without PSAD treatment. All the average performance parameters of PSAD-treated devices show significant improvement compared with those of control devices, which is attributed to the effective passivation of PSAD. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the PSAD-treated device is shown in Fig. S5.† The integrated JSC is 24.61 mA cm−2 for the PSAD-treated device, which is almost consistent with the measured J–V results (average value of 25.19 ± 0.37 mA cm−2), and significantly higher than that (23.20 mA cm−2) of the control devices (average value of 24.12 ± 0.44 mA cm−2), indicating the high reliability of the PSAD-treated devices. The performance parameters for both devices with/without PSAD treatment are summarized in Table S2 and S3,† separately.

To gain insight into the improvement of device performance, UV-vis absorption spectra were used to study light absorption of the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 4a, the absorbance of PSAD-treated perovskite films in the range of 500–800 nm is significantly enhanced, which is mainly related to the enhanced crystallinity of perovskite films. The Urbach energy (Eu) can be derived from the absorption tail and obtained according to eqn (1).39 (1)where α is the absorption coefficient, α0 is a constant, and hν is the photon energy. It was estimated that the Eu reduces from 31 meV for the pristine perovskite film to 25 meV in Fig. 4b, suggesting that the defect density in the PSAD-treated film is significantly reduced. We then used steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy to study the carrier dynamics of the perovskite films on glass substrates. The PL intensity of the PSAD-treated perovskite film is much stronger than that of the pristine perovskite film as shown in Fig. 4c because of the high radiative recombination of the PSAD-treated film, which also suggests that non-radiative recombination is effectively inhibited in the PSAD-treated perovskite film. Besides, a peak blueshifts from 801 nm to 798 nm after the introduction of PSAD, indicating that there is a drop in defect density due to the effective passivation of PSAD on the perovskite film.13Fig. 4d shows the TRPL spectrum of both perovskite films with/without PSAD, and their attenuation curve is fitted by the following exponential function formula (Eqn (2)). (2)where A1 and A2 are relative decay amplitudes, τ1 and τ2 are fast decay and slow decay times,40 respectively, and Y0 is a constant. The fitting parameters are shown in Table S4.† The average carrier lifetime is calculated according to eqn (3). (3)

The τave of the PSAD-treated perovskite film increases from 8.67 ns for the pristine perovskite film to 68.11 ns, and thus, the non-radiative recombination of the PSAD-treated perovskite film is effectively suppressed.41
To investigate the effect of PSAD on the defects of perovskite film, which have a direct influence on device performance, the space charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to estimate the defect density of the perovskite films with/without PSAD. Electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag and hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au were exploited,42,43 respectively. Fig. S6† shows the J–V curves of devices with only-electron transport and only-hole transport in the dark. There are two regions in the curves, the ohmic region (low bias) and the trap filling limited (TFL) region (medium bias). A continuous increase of voltage in the middle bias region makes it reach the defect filling limit voltage. The intersection of the tangent lines of two different areas is the defect filling limit voltage (VTFL). It can be seen that the VTFLs of the electron-only and hole-only devices decrease from 0.66 and 0.59 V and from 0.24 to 0.16 V after the addition of PSAD, respectively. The defect density (nt) can be calculated according to eqn (4). (4)where ε is the relative permittivity of the perovskite, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, e is the elementary charge, and L is the thickness of the perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 5a, the nt of the electron-only device with PSAD treatment reduced from 1.32 × 1016 cm−3 (for the control device) to 1.18 × 1016 cm−3, and that of the hole-only device with PSAD treatment reduced from 4.81 × 1015 cm−3 (for the control device) to 3.21 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The reductions for both electron and hole defect densities are attributed to the effective passivation of PSAD on perovskite films.

The charge recombination would lead to a dark current, which can be derived from the J–V curve obtained in the dark.44 As shown in Fig. 5b, the current density of the PSAD-treated device is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the control device, indicating that the introduction of PSAD effectively passivates defects and thus reduces the charge recombination. The charge recombination kinetics can be estimated by using the ideality factor, which can be calculated according to eqn (5).45 (5)where n, kB, T, q, I, and I0 are the ideality factor, Boltzmann's constant, temperature, elementary charge, light intensity, and initial light intensity, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5c, the slope of the PSAD-treated device is 1.40 kT/q and it is 1.64 kT/q for the control device. The decrease in the slope indicates that the trap-assisted Shockley Reed Hall (SRH) recombination is effectively suppressed, which can help to reduce the VOC loss.
Transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were used to further study the charge recombination dynamics of devices with/without PSAD. We can see from Fig. 5d that the photovoltage decay time of the PSAD-doped device is longer than that of the control device, which is attributed to faster carrier extraction and less charge recombination.46 To gain further insight into the influence of PSAD on the recombination dynamic, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of devices with/without PSAD treatment was measured under the dark condition with a voltage of 0.8 V as shown in Fig. 5e. The first complete semicircle and the second incomplete semicircle are related to the charge transfer resistance (RCT) and the recombination resistance (Rrec),47 respectively. RS represents the series resistance of wires and electrodes in a device. The equivalent circuit model shown in Fig. 5e was used to fit the data, and the fitting results are shown in Table S5.† It can be seen from the fitting results that the PSAD-treated device shows lower Rs and RCT, indicating the effective transport and transfer of carriers. Additionally, the PSAD-treated device shows significantly enhanced Rrec, which shows that the charge recombination is remarkably reduced. We then used the Mott–Schottky curve to analyze the built-in potential (Vbi) of the devices to further study the trapping and accumulation behavior of carriers. As shown in Fig. 5f, the Vbi of the PSAD-treated device is 0.92 V, which is 0.02 V higher than that (0.90 V) of the control device. The increase in Vbi indicates a higher driving force for the separation of electrons and holes,48 and thus, the charge recombination is suppressed, which is beneficial to the increase of VOC.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to investigate the electronic structure of perovskite film surfaces with/without PSAD treatment. As shown in Fig. S7a and b,† the Ecutoffs are 1.87 eV and 1.76 eV for devices without and with PSAD treatment, respectively. Due to the same EFermi as shown in Fig. S7c and d,† both perovskite films exhibit the same work function (Φ = hν − EFermi). The valence band maximums (VBMs) were calculated to be −5.82 eV and −5.71 eV for devices without and with PSAD treatment, respectively. Fig. S7e† shows the bandgap of the perovskite films derived from the UV-vis absorption spectra. Correspondingly, the conduction band minimums (CBMs) are −4.24 eV and −4.14 eV for the control and PSAD-treated perovskite films. Fig. S6f† shows an energy level diagram for each layer used in PSCs. After the introduction of PSAD, the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Spiro-OMeTAD (−5.22 eV) and VBM of perovskite is smaller, indicating the lower energy loss of hole extraction/transport at this interface. Besides, the CBM of the PSAD-treated perovskite films is more conducive to electron extraction from perovskite to SnO2 (−4.20 eV).
The long-term stability of devices with/without PSAD treatment was investigated. The stability of devices under continuous illumination at MPP is shown in Fig. 6a. The results showed that the PSAD-treated device retained ∼90% of its initial PCE after 500 h compared with ∼70% remaining after 390 h for the control device under continuous illumination. It is reported that the stability is related to the change of ion migration under strain.49 The activation energy (Ea) for ion migration can be estimated by the temperature-dependent conductivity measurement. As shown in Fig. 6b and c, the Eas for ion migration are 0.859 eV and 1.037 eV for the control perovskite film and the PSAD-treated film, respectively. The increase of Ea shows that the introduction of PSAD can enhance the barrier of ion migration, and thus, will be beneficial to device stability.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully used an organic small molecule (PSAD) to regulate the growth of perovskite grains and to passivate defects of perovskite films via coordination bonding and hydrogen bonding interactions between PSAD and perovskite. On the one hand, it enlarged the perovskite grains and reduced non-radiation recombination. On the other hand, it reduced both electron and hole defect density. As a result, the PSAD-treated device achieved a significantly improved PCE of 23.85% compared with that of 21.46% for the control device. In addition, the introduction of PSAD improved the operational stability of the devices. This work provides an effective chemical concept and contributes to further exploring the mechanism of passivation to enhance both the efficiency and stability of PSCs.
