    , Accepted 18th April 2018First published on 23rd April 2018AbstractSolution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have been attracting more and more attention for a series of well-known advantages, and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 11% have been reported. However, the highest PCE of the OSCs based on small molecule donor/polymer acceptor blends is only 4.82%, which was much lower than those of other types of OSCs due to weak absorption of the polymer acceptor and the unbalanced charge carrier mobility of the small molecule donor and the polymer acceptor. Here, we fabricated small molecule donor/polymer acceptor-based OSCs using the wide bandgap SM1 and DR3TBDTT as the small molecular donor and the low-bandgap n-type conjugated polymer PZ1 as the polymer acceptor. With the treatment of a solvent additive, which can promote the absorption intensity, enhance the carrier mobility and suppress the charge carrier recombination, the SM1-based devices and the DR3TBDTT-based devices show PCEs of 3.97% and 5.86%, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the PCE of 5.86% is the state-of-the-art efficiency for OSCs based on the small molecular donor/polymer acceptor system.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have been attracting more and more attention because of their unique advantages, such as lightweight and flexibility.1 Most OSCs based on interpenetrating networks of polymer donors and fullerene acceptors have exhibited power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 10%.2 Nowadays, non-fullerene acceptors are gaining increasing attention due to their broad and strong absorption, highly tunable molecular energy levels and potential for reducing synthesis costs, and PCEs of over 11% have been recorded.3–16 For the non-fullerene OSCs, depending on whether the donor and the acceptor are polymers or small molecules, the types of OSCs can be divided into four categories: polymer donor/small molecule acceptor (PD/MA type), and polymer donor/polymer acceptor (PD/PA type), as well as small molecule donor/small molecule acceptor (MD/MA type) and small molecule donor/polymer acceptor (MD/PA type).17,18 For the PD/MA and MD/MA type OSCs, corresponding PCEs of over 11% (ref. 3–10, 12–16 and 19–24) and over 9% (ref. 25–27) have been achieved, respectively. Also PCEs of over 9% have been obtained for the PD/PA type OSCs.28–30
The studies of MD/PA OSCs lag behind the other three types of OSCs, and naphthodithiophene diimide (NDI) and perylene diimide (PDI) based n-type conjugated polymers are the widely studied PAs. For MD/PDI-based PA type OSCs, their efficiencies are mostly lower than 3%. In 2014, Zhan et al. used the dithienosilole based small molecule p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 as the donor and a PDI-based polymer PPDIDTT as the acceptor, the device showed a PCE of 0.29%.31 In 2015, they changed the donor to DIB-SQ (a kind of squaraine dye) and adopted a layer-by-layer fabrication method simultaneously, the PCE was improved to 1.12%.32 Almost at the same time, Zhou et al. utilized p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 as the MD and three kinds of PDI-based PAs (PX-PDI, X = C, T, and Se), a higher PCE of 3.01% was obtained for the MD/PA type OSCs.18 For the NDI-based PAs, N2200 is a benchmark acceptor for MD/PA type OSC studies. Thanks to its high electron mobility and excellent ambient stability, N2200 has quickly become the widely used polymer acceptor, showing an efficiency of over 4%.33–37 Thus, intensive research studies focus on developing small molecule donors to blend with N2200. For example, with p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 as a donor, Nguyen et al. reported a PCE of 2.11%, and with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based small molecule DTD as a donor Inganäs et al. obtained an increased PCE of 3.74%.36 Then, by constructing a DPP-based three-dimensional (3D) donor C-DPP, a further increased PCE of 4.64% was obtained. Later, by taking the advantages of a dithienopyran unit as the core, Jo et al. developed another DPP based small molecule donor DTP-DPP, and a PCE of 4.82% was achieved for the MD/PA OSCs. However, the maximum PCE of the MD/PA type OSCs is still much lower than those of the other three types of OSCs. The low efficiency could be ascribed to the unmatched carrier mobilities and poorer miscibility between the small molecular donor and the polymer acceptor in the MD/PA type OSCs.33 Exploring new MD/PA pairs and studying their photovoltaic performance could provide new opportunities to understand the structure–property relationship of the photovoltaic materials and the rules to match with the small molecule donor and the polymer acceptor for further improving the efficiency of OSCs.
Despite the unique advantages (such as high electron mobility and excellent ambient stability) of the rylenediimide (NDI and PDI) based PAs, their weak absorption and poor miscibility with the MD are the two main reasons, limiting the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and PCE. Thus, to further enhance the efficiency, (I) exploring a new low-bandgap PA with intense and broad absorption, and (II) finding a MD that can provide balanced carrier mobilities and complementary absorption with a PA, as well as (III) controlling the morphologies, are the three plausible approaches, and should be optimized simultaneously.
As reported in our previous work, we recently synthesized a high-performance polymer acceptor PZ1 with higher electron mobility, broad and strong absorption along with good film-forming properties.28 Here, to fabricate efficient MD/PA type OSCs, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type small molecules of SM1 and DR3TBDT were selected as the donor to pair with PZ1 because of their outstanding performance in OSCs with the acceptors of non-fullerene (such as IDIC)25 and fullerene (such as PC71BM).38,39 By additive treatment, we successfully promoted the absorption intensity and the carrier mobility of the donor and the acceptor. The devices based on the blends of SM1:PZ1 and DR3TBDTT:PZ1 show the PCE of 3.97% and 5.86%, respectively. The PCE of 5.86% represents the most efficient MD/PA type OSCs reported so far.
2. Results and discussion
The chemical structures of SM1, DR3TBDTT and PZ1 are shown in Fig. 1. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of SM1, DR3TBDTT and PZ1 are −2.82 eV/−5.24 eV,25 −3.27 eV/−5.02 eV,38 and −3.86 eV/−5.74 eV,28 respectively. Between the SM1 (or DR3TBDTT) donor and the PZ1 acceptor, the LUMO energy offset is 1.04 eV (or 0.59 eV), while the HOMO energy level offset is 0.50 eV (or 0.74 eV). It can be seen from Fig. 1c that each donor/acceptor pair demonstrates a cascading energy level. Hence the photocurrent generated from both the donor and the acceptor absorptions could be expected. Moreover, the film absorption of the donors (SM1 and DR3TBDTT) is provided in Fig. 1d, along with the absorption of the PZ1 acceptor. The complementary absorption of the donor and the acceptor components should be desirable for enhancing the light harvest in a broad wavelength range.

2.1. Photovoltaic properties
The OSCs were fabricated with a conventional sandwich structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SM1 (or DR3TBDTT):PZ1/PNDIT-F3N-Br/Al to investigate the photovoltaic performance, where PEDOT:PSS is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) and PNDIT-F3N-Br is poly[(9,9-bis(3-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-5,5-bis(2,2-thiophene)-2,6-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracaboxylic-N,N-di(2-ethylhexyl)imide]dibromide.40 The active layer was spin-cast from a chloroform solution with a varied MD/PA weight ratio from 1:1 to 4:1 at a total blend concentration of 17 mg mL−1. As shown in Tables S1–S4 in the ESI,† the optimal donor/acceptor weight ratio is 2.5:1, using N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) as an additive (4%, v/v) for SM1:PZ1-based devices and chloronaphthalene (CN) as an additive (1%, v/v) for DR3TBDTT:PZ1-based devices, respectively. Moreover, the detailed device performance parameters of the OSCs with different additives are listed in Tables S5 and S6 in the ESI† for a clear comparison. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1, for the SM1:PZ1-based and DR3TBDTT:PZ1-based devices without any treatment, the PCE is very low (0.36% and 0.24%, respectively). With the treatment of additives, the PCEs of the optimized devices were dramatically increased, reaching 3.97% for the SM1-based device and 5.86% for the DR3TBDTT-based device. The increased efficiencies are mainly benefitted from a sharp rise in Jsc, from 1.40 to 7.34 mA cm−2 for the SM1-based device and from 1.06 to 11.36 mA cm−2 for the DR3TBDTT-based device. The fill factor (FF) for the optimized device was also increased, from 27.52% to 61.34% for the SM1-based device and from 25.99% to 59.66% for the DR3TBDTT-based device. For the optimized devices, the Vocs are 0.865 V for the DR3TBDTT-based device and 0.883 V for the SM1-based device. The larger Voc value of the SM1-based device is benefitted from its deeper HOMO energy levels. It is reported that a high Voc of 1.03 V was achieved for the OSC based on a donor:acceptor blend with a HOMO energy offset as low as 80 meV.41 Thus it can be concluded that the Voc for the PZ1-based device can be further increased if a low-lying HOMO donor is used. In addition, it is worth noting that the SM1-based OSCs displayed reduced Voc while the DR3TBDTT-based ones displayed slightly increased Voc after the additive treatment. For the SM1-based OSCs, the slight decrease of Voc is a common phenomenon, due to the slight up-shifting of the donor HOMO energy level caused by their improved ordering aggregation after the additive treatment,42 while the slight increase of the Voc for the DR3TBDTT-based OSCs could benefit from the reduction of the charge carrier recombination in the DR3TBDTT:IDIC active layer by the additive treatment.

By comparing with the SM1-based optimized devices, the DR3TBDTT-based optimized devices show a higher PCE mainly due to its higher Jsc (11.36 mA cm−2vs. 7.34 mA cm−2). Notably, the PCE of 5.86% is the highest value reported in the literature to date for the MD/PA type devices. Our study demonstrated that by choosing a suitable MD/PA pair with proper device engineering, the PCE of the MD/PA type OSCs can be further increased. The significantly improved Jsc is consistent with the change in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum (Fig. 2b). With the treatment of additives, the EQE values in the whole wavelength region increased, no matter whether SM1 or DR3TBDTT was used as a donor. For the DR3TBDTT-based devices, their higher EQE value over that of the SM1-based devices could be associated with their more efficient charge separation between the donor and the acceptor.
2.2. Effect of the additive treatment on the optical properties of the blend films
To investigate the effects of additives on the device performance, absorption spectra of the MD/PA blend films with or without additives were measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 3a. In comparison with the absorption spectrum of the pure SM1 film with a main peak at 563 nm and a shoulder peak at 608 nm (Fig. 1d), the main absorption peak of SM1 in the blend film with PZ1 is blue-shifted to 555 nm, and its shoulder peak becomes invisible (see Fig. 3a), implying a relatively disordered dispersion of SM1 into the PZ1 component. For the PZ1 component in the blend films, there is no clear change for the main peak at 703 nm. After the additive treatment of the blend film with 4% NMP, the main peak of SM1 was enhanced and red-shifted from 555 nm to 567 nm, and the shoulder peak at 608 nm re-appears and becomes more obvious than that of its pure film. In addition, the peak at 702 nm assigned to PZ1 becomes narrower and sharper (see Fig. 3a). The results suggest that the NMP additive treatment promotes the aggregation of SM1 and PZ1 simultaneously. And the increase of the ordered stacking of SM1 and PZ1 in the blend film should be beneficial for increasing the charge carrier mobility. Similarly, the 1% CN additive treatment of the DR3TBDTT-based blend film also promotes the aggregation of both components, especially for the DR3TBDTT component with enhanced absorbance (Fig. 3a). In comparison of the absorption spectra of the blend film (Fig. 3a) and the EQE spectra of PSCs (Fig. 2b), it can be concluded that the enhancement in absorbance is not the only factor that contributes to the higher Jsc. The improvement of charge carrier mobilities and the suppression of the charge carrier recombination should also play very important role in increasing Jsc and obtaining higher PCE.
 Fig. 3  (a) UV-vis absorption spectra of the as-cast blend films optimized by the solvent additive treatment; (b) photoluminescence spectra of SM1 (excited at 560 nm) and DR3TBDTT (excited at 590 nm) as well as the blend films of SM1:PZ1 (excited at 560 nm) and DR3TBDTT:PZ1 (excited at 590 nm) without or with additives (NMP and CN, respectively); (c) photoluminescence spectra of PZ1 as well as the blend films of SM1:PZ1 and DR3TBDTT:PZ1 without or with additives (NMP and CN, respectively) (excited at 700 nm). 
In addition, the photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments give further information on the aggregation structure of the blend films after the additive treatment (see Fig. 3b and c). For the as-cast SM1:PZ1 film, when the excitation wavelength is 560 nm, only the donor is excited. It is easy to see that the quenching extent is almost 100% in the blend film relative to that of the pure SM1 film (see Fig. 3b), indicating that the dissociation of excitons generated in the donor domain is rather efficient at the SM1:PZ1 interface. When the excitation wavelength is changed to 700 nm, only the acceptor component is excited. The PL quenching extent of PZ1 in the blend films is ∼98% (see Fig. 3c), implying that the hole transfer at the donor/acceptor interface is also very efficient. Notably, other factors, such as defects far from the interface in the as-cast films, should be also taken into account for the efficient exciton quenching. The efficient PL quenching also implies that a well mixed donor and acceptor component, which could make it easy for the carrier recombination at the interface. When 4% NMP was added, although the quenching efficiencies for the donor and the acceptor are slightly reduced, a high quenching efficiency of ∼96% for SM1 and ∼95% for PZ1 are still observed (see Fig. 3b and c), which may be attributed to a larger aggregation domain of the donor or the acceptor. In addition, for the DR3TBDTT:PZ1-blend film, quenching experiments show a similar trend for the blend films with or without the additive treatment.
2.3. Exciton dissociation, charge transport and recombination
To gain more insight into the charge transport properties of the OSCs, the space-charge limited current (SCLC) technique was used to estimate the hole and electron mobilities. The typical J1/2–V curves are shown in Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI† with the results summarized in Tables 2 and S7 in the ESI.† For the as-cast SM1-based blend film, its carrier mobility is relatively low with a hole mobility of 1.01 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 1.30 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Notably, the hole mobility of the blend film is lower than those values obtained from the pure SM1 film (2.21 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), indicating a disorder of donor molecules after blending with PZ1. With the 4% NMP additive treatment, both the hole (7.70 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electron mobility (4.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) are increased, noticeably for the hole mobility. This demonstrates that the NMP additive treatment facilitates the aggregation of both components, especially for SM1. The enhancement of the hole and electron mobilities in the blend films could lead to a more efficient carrier transportation and collection. As for the DR3TBDTT-based blend film, it shows a similar trend on the carrier mobility as that on the SM1-based blend films with the treatment of additive. The results suggest that in the MD/PA type OSCs, using the additive treatment is an effective approach to modulate the carrier mobility toward high efficiency. Thus, treating with the NMP or CN additive plays a vital role in optimizing the morphology of the active layer to enhance the charge carrier mobility, which is very important in obtaining a high PCE of the photovoltaic devices.

The relationship between the photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) was investigated to estimate the exciton dissociation.43Jph is obtained from JL by subtracting JD where JL is the current density under light irradiation and JD is the dark current density without illumination. Veff is defined by V0 − V, where V is the applied voltage and V0 is the value of the voltage where Jph = 0. A plot of Jphversus Veff is presented in Fig. 4a. For the SM1-based device without any treatment, the Jph doesn't show a saturation regime even within the whole measurement region (even at Veff = 3 V), suggesting a serious geminate and/or bimolecular recombination. This mainly results from the unfavorable blend morphology.44–46 In contrast, the Jph of the SM1-based device with the 4% NMP additive treatment increases in nearly linear dependence on the voltage at low Veff and gradually saturates at the high Veff (>0.3 V), exhibiting that most of the photo-generated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and the collection of charge carriers at the electrodes is relatively efficient. For a quantitative comparison, the saturation current density Jsat is defined by the value where the Veff is equal to 2 V, and the charge dissociation probability (P(E,T)) can be estimated from the value of the photocurrent density Jph divided by the saturated photocurrent density Jsat, using the equation of P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat. Under the short circuit and maximal power output conditions, the P(E,T) values are 47.5% and 23.1% for the as-cast device, and 93.4% and 76.8% for the additive treated devices, respectively, suggesting a higher charge collection efficiency after device optimization with the treatment of additives. Moreover, the optimized device shows a smaller series resistance (22.6 vs. 417.0 Ω cm2) and a far larger shunt resistance (1.28 vs. 0.77 kΩ cm2) than those of the as-cast device (see Table 1), also indicating a better diode quality for the optimized device. For the DR3TBDTT-based device, device optimization with an additive (1% CN) also improved the diode quality and higher charge collection efficiency with the P(E,T) values of 93.1% under maximal power output conditions and 71.7% under short circuit conditions. The results indicate that device optimization with an additive is an effective approach to improve the diode quality and the charge collection efficiency.

The dependence of Jsc on the light intensity (P) can be used to distinguish the bimolecular recombination behavior from the monomolecular recombination of the OSCs,47 and the results are presented in Fig. 4b. Generally, Jsc and P follow the relationship of Jsc ∝ Pα.48 The value of α should be equal to 1 if there is no bimolecular recombination, while α < 1 indicates some extent of bimolecular recombination. For the SM1:PZ1-based device, the α value is 0.916 for the as-cast device and 0.983 for the device with the 4% NMP additive treatment. This means that there exists some bimolecular recombination for the as-cast device while the bimolecular recombination can be well suppressed with the treatment of the 4% NMP additive. After NMP additive optimization, the relatively larger domain size (as discussed below) and the higher carrier mobility can account for its reduced bimolecular recombination. For the DR3TBDTT based device, it shows a similar trend with an α value of 0.936 for the as-cast device and 0.989 for the CN (1%) additive optimized devices. In addition, after additive optimization, an α value for the DR3TBDTT-based device is slightly higher than that of the SM1-based device, which agrees with its better device performance.
We also studied the dependence of Voc on light intensity to investigate the recombination mechanisms, and the results are shown in Fig. 4c. If the sole loss mechanism is the bimolecular recombination, the slope of Vocversus the natural logarithm of the light intensity line should be close to kT/q,47,49 where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, and q is the elementary charge. When the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination is the dominant mechanism, the slope is 2kT/q.47 However, because of the competition between the SRH recombination and bimolecular recombination, the corresponding slope should be usually between kT/q and 2kT/q. For the SM1-based device, the slope is 1.41 for the as-cast device and 1.16 for the 4% NMP additive optimized device. Interestingly, the slope of the as-cast DR3TBDTT-based device could be separated into two regions. Under lower light intensity (from 0 to 20 mW), the slope is 6.81kT/q, while under higher light intensity (from 20 to 100 mW), the slope drops to 2.44kT/q, both being larger than 2kT/q. This might be caused by several factors, such as the trap-assisted (SRH) recombination,50 the energetic disorder,51–53 as well as the surface recombination54–57 and/or leakage current.58 In contrast to the optimized SM1-based device, the slope for the DR3TBDTT based device with the 1% CN treatment is only 1.27kT/q, indicating efficient suppression of the recombination. Furthermore, from the relative low EQE value (∼50%) for the additive treated device (Fig. 2b), it can be concluded that the non-geminate recombination is obviously not the limiting factor, because the fill factors are relatively high (∼60%), and Jsc is not far from the saturation current. This needs to be further confirmed by transient-absorption spectroscopy.59
2.4. Film morphologies
To understand the effect of additives on the device performance, we employed atomic force microscopy (AFM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the morphological features of the blend films. Fig. 5 shows the AFM images and TEM images of the active layers. For the SM1-based blends, the surface of the as-cast films is relatively smooth and uniform, showing a root mean square (RMS) roughness of only 1.09 nm. Interestingly, the RMS values of the blend film are even smaller than those of the pure PZ1 films (2.09 nm, see Fig. S3 in the ESI†) and much less than those of SM1 (11.8 nm, see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The results suggest that the PZ1 component restricts the aggregation of SM1, and SM1 is well distributed among the polymer networks. As a consequence, the uniform mixed blend films and the small domain size cause a serious nongeminate recombination of carriers, and hence a low Jsc and FF. With the addition of 4% NMP, one can easily observe an obvious aggregation with a RMS roughness of 17.8 nm (even larger than that of the pure SM1 film), suggesting an enhanced crystallinity of the SM1 component in the blend film after 4% NMP was added. The higher crystallinity of the SM1 component results in a higher hole mobility and a reduced carrier recombination. Similar results can also be obtained from the TEM images, a relatively homogeneous for the as-cast film vs. an obvious phase separation along with a bicontinuous interpenetrating network for the optimized film. As confirmed by AFM and TEM tests, for the DR3TBDTT-based blend film, it shows a similar aggregation behavior as that for the SM1-based blend film with the additive treatment. This phenomenon is probably due to a similar molecular architecture between the donors. In the case of different donors, the SM1-based blends with 4% NMP show a much larger RMS roughness of 17.8 nm than those of the DR3TBDTT-based blends with 1% CN, which is likely related to a larger domain size. Too large domain size means a longer time for the exciton diffusion to the donor/acceptor interface and thus a stronger geminate recombination, which is properly the main reason for the relatively lower Jsc of the SM1-based OSCs. To get an excellent performance of this MD/PA type device, it is needed to do furtherdeep studies on the materials design and device optimization.

Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXS) was measured to probe the detailed aggregation behavior of the blend films. The GIWAXS images and related data are shown in Fig. 6, Tables 2 and S7 in the ESI.† In the GIWAXS images, the intensity profiles versus wave vectors qz and qxy correspond to the molecular arrangement order in out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane directions (IP), respectively. First, for the SM1 and DR3TBDTT neat films, they show an edge-on orientation with pronounced laminar stacking peaks (h00). SM1 only exhibits (100), (200) and (300) lamellar stacking peaks while DR3TBDTT shows four order peaks. Meanwhile, the crystal coherence length (CCL) of the (010) peak in the IP direction is estimated (via Scherrer equation) to be 41.80 Å for SM1, which is comparable to that of DR3TBDTT (42.00 Å). In addition, the d-spacing of the π–π stacking of SM1 (3.67 Å) is similar to that of DR3TBDTT (3.65 Å), indicating a similar molecular stacking for the two donors. In contrast, PZ1 shows a face-on orientation with a (010) stacking at 1.63 Å−1 (3.86 Å) and a (100) diffraction peak at 0.25 Å−1 (25.52 Å).

Fig. 6e and f show line cuts of the GIWAXS images for the as-cast SM1-based blend film. For the SM1 component, its characteristic crystalline peaks that appears in its neat film (Fig. 6a) disappeared, this can be seen from the (h00) diffraction peaks in the OOP direction and the (010) π–π stacking peak in the IP direction, and the blend film is dominated by the characteristic crystalline peaks of PZ1. These results suggest that the SM1 component is disorderly distributed in the blend film, while for the blend films with 4% NMP, those characteristic peaks of the SM1 component re-appeared, suggesting a crystalline structure (see Fig. 6g). This was further confirmed by the shorter d-spacing of the (100) peak and remarkably longer CCL value (Table 2). Besides, we could easily find that the PZ1 component is also densely packed with a shorter (010) π–π stacking distance (Table 2 and Fig. 6e). Thus, the NMP additive treatment promoted the aggregation of SM1 and PZ1, which will in turn help to improve the mobility and collection of carriers.60,61 When DR3TBDTT was used as a donor, it shows a similar aggregation behavior although different additives were used (Fig. 6e, h and i). In both cases (with SM1 or DR3TBDTT as a donor), the additive treatment is contributed to the formation of the suitable phase separation size and molecular stacking of the donor and acceptor components, which is beneficial to the enhancement of the absorption and carrier mobility. In addition, when compared with the optimized blend films (Fig. 6g and i), it can be found that when DR3TBDTT was used as a donor, it shows a less aggregation behavior in comparison with that of SM1, thus showing a proper domain size for exciton dissociation. This was supported by the AFM and TEM measurements.
3. Conclusion
Small molecules of SM1 and DR3TBDTT were used as donors, and PZ1 was used as an acceptor to fabricate efficient MD/PA type OSCs. It was found that adding additives in the SM1 or DR3TBDTT based blend film promoted the aggregation of both components, most noticeably for the donor component. Thus the absorption intensity of the blend films, especially those of the donor component, was largely enhanced. In addition, the morphology investigations give further information on the aggregation structure of the blend films after the additive treatment. Thus, the additive treatment promoted proper phase separation, which will in turn help to increase the carrier mobility while suppressing the carrier recombination, so as to increase the charge transportation and collection efficiency. As a consequence, the SM1:PZ1-based device with the 4% NMP treatment shows a PCE of 3.97% and the PCE for DR3TBDTT:PZ1-based devices with the 1% CN treatment reaches a high value of 5.86%. Notably, the PCE of 5.86% represents the state-of-the-art efficiency of the MD/PA type OSCs reported so far. The higher PCE of the DR3TBDTT:PZ1-based devices with 1% CN is mainly due to their proper phase separation and much stronger UV-vis absorption. The results suggest that the additive treatment is an effective approach to improve the efficiency of the MD/PA type OSCs and there is still a considerable room to improve the efficiency of the MD/PA type OSCs.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Fabrication and characterization of devices
The OSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/active layer/PFNBr-NDI/cathode. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS was deposited through spin-coating on a precleaned ITO-coated glass from a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Baytron P VP AI 4083 from H. C. Starck) at 3000 rpm and dried subsequently at 150 °C for 15 min in air. Then the device was transferred to a nitrogen glove box, where the active blend layers of SM1 or DR3TBDTT and PZ1 were spin-coated from its chloroform solution (totally 17 mg mL−1) with or without additives (4% (v/v) NMP for the SM1-based devices and 1% (v/v) CN for the DR3TBDTT-based devices) onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The thickness of the active layer was about 80 and 90 nm for the SM1-based devices and DR3TBDTT-based devices, respectively. Then the methanol solution of PFNBr-NDI at a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 was deposited atop the active layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a top Al electrode was deposited in a vacuum onto the cathode buffer layer at a pressure of ca. 5.0 × 10−5 Pa.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OSCs were measured in a glove box on a computer-controlled Keithley 2450 Source-Measure Unit. An Oriel Sol3A Class AAA Solar Simulator (model, Newport 94023A) with a 450 W xenon lamp and an air mass (AM) 1.5 filter was used as the light source. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by a Newport Oriel 91150V reference cell. The input photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) was measured by a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3-011 (Enli Technology Co., Ltd., Taiwan). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell. An optical microscope (Olympus BX51) was used to define the active area (4.6 mm2) of the device.
4.2. Mobility measurements
Hole and electron mobilities were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Device structures are ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SM1 or DR3TBDTT:PZ1 (2.5:1, w/w)/Au for hole-only devices and ITO/ZnO/SM1 or DR3TBDTT:PZ1 (2.5:1, w/w)/PNDIT-F3N-Br/Al for electron-only devices. The SCLC mobilities were calculated using the Mott–Gurney equation:62,63 (1)where J is the current density, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the active layer material usually 2–4 for an organic semiconductor, herein we use a relative dielectric constant of 3, ε0 is the permittivity of empty space, μ is the mobility of hole or electron L is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the internal voltage in the device, and V = Vapplied − Vbuilt-in (in the hole-only and the electron-only devices, the Vbi values are 0.2 V and 0 V respectively), where Vapplied is the voltage applied to the device, and Vbuilt-in is the built-in voltage resulting from the relative work function difference between the two electrodes.
