    , Accepted 5th July 2022First published on 6th July 2022AbstractRechargeable zinc-ion batteries employing a metallic zinc anode and aqueous electrolytes have received significant attention since they are safe, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly. Thanks to the introduction of orthophosphate ions, vanadium phosphates exhibit a higher working voltage as cathodes for zinc-ion batteries than other vanadium-based materials. However, due to the poor cycling stability and complex mechanism, stricter requirements are put forward on their manufacturing technique. Herein, a comprehensive review of the recent research progress in vanadium phosphate electrode materials is presented, focusing on modification strategies based on different crystal structures and the energy storage behaviors of zinc ions in operation. Moreover, research directions and prospects are discussed.
Introduction
Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal power provide huge amounts of electrical energy. However, they cannot meet the demands of people and the development of science and technology due to their intermittent nature. Therefore, electrochemical energy storage devices, such as metal (Li, Na, Zn, K, Al, Mg, Mn)-ion batteries, play a crucial role in overcoming the worldwide energy challenge and realizing sustainable development.1–9 Metallic zinc has a low resistance (5.91 μΩ cm−1), an ideal theoretical capacity (820 mA h g−1), and a suitable working potential (−0.763 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode, SHE), and thus exhibits competitive advantages in matching with aqueous electrolytes.10,11 Thus, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have sparked tremendous interest as emerging energy storage devices. Researchers are devoted to seeking more suitable cathode materials to achieve high energy densities, remarkable rate capabilities, and long cycle life.
Recently, both organic (e.g., phenanthrenequinone macrocyclic trimer, poly(2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinonyl sulfide))12,13 and inorganic compounds have been reported as effective cathodes for AZIBs. Table 1 shows a preliminary comparison of two selected cathodes each for various cathode categories to intuitively present the differences in their electrochemical parameters. Among them, there has been more in-depth research into inorganic compounds, such as manganese-based materials,14–18 vanadium-based materials,19,20 Prussian blue analogues,21,22 and polyanion materials.23–26 Compact internal space and limited ion intercalation sites cause the Prussian blue analogues to exhibit unsatisfactory reversible capacity and cycling stability. In contrast, the manganese oxides and vanadium oxides with layered structures have effective ion (de)intercalation processes, and the former have a higher operating voltage platform but a lower capacity. Vanadyl phosphates and polyanionic-type vanadium phosphates are a particular class of vanadium-based materials that can boost the redox potential via the inductive effect of the polyanion PO43−.27 Additionally, the intense polarization of the O2− could reduce the metal–oxygen covalent bonding and further increase the redox potential of the transition metals.28 The vanadium phosphate cathodes can be grouped into two categories. One category is the vanadyl phosphates, in which the layered structure providing a large open 2D channels for (de)intercalation of Zn2+. The other category includes polyanionic-type and NASICON-type vanadium phosphates, which have high structural stability and interconnected 3D channels, together with flexible active sites that can be constructed internally, which are beneficial for Zn2+ transmission. However, these materials present various potential issues. For example, VOPO4·xH2O suffers from serious decomposition in conventional Zn(CF3SO3)2 (or ZnSO4) electrolyte, and the strong electrostatic interactions between Zn2+ and the host structure lead to unsatisfactory cycling stability.29 Furthermore, the polyanion-type phosphates undergo serious dissolution of their active materials during operation. For example, Na3V2(PO4)3 dissolves spontaneously in aqueous solution with a large amount of by-products being formed on the surface of electrode, leading to a short lifespan.30 These differences in the crystal structures of the materials usually determine the strategies for their modification. Combined with the rich valence states of vanadium (ranging from +2 to +5), rational structural designs are expected to enable vanadium-based materials to achieve higher operating voltage platforms as cathodes for AZIBs, based on inheriting its ideal reversible capacity and cycling stability.

This review focuses on the recent progress in vanadium phosphate cathodes for AZIBs, including interlayer modification strategies of vanadyl phosphates (such as VOPO4·2H2O)31,32 and NASICON-type (such as Li3V2(PO4)3, Na3V2(PO4)3)33,34 vanadium phosphates. Fundamental understanding of the correlations between the electrochemical performances and zinc storage behaviors in cathodes with different crystal structures is highlighted. Furthermore, the characteristics and issues associated with the reported cathodes, such as layered VOPO4 with two-dimensional (2D) diffusion channels and NASICON-type structures with thermodynamic stability, are exhaustively analyzed. From this analysis, we have tried to identify strategies to improve the electrochemical performance, which will contribute to the development of vanadium-based cathodes with higher operating voltage platforms and stable cycle life (Fig. 1).

Vanadyl phosphates
Layered VOPO4, which is a typical polyanion cathode with corresponding 2D diffusion channels, has aroused the interest of researchers. AZIBs exhibit a typical “rocking chair” energy storage mechanism. Thus, we need to consider a stable structure for Zn2+ (de)intercalation and variable valence states for the matched cathodes. Additionally, it is noted that many energy storage mechanisms are based on the redox behavior of the cation, such as the V cation in vanadium-based cathodes, in organic electrolytes.35,36 Once redox behavior is realized in the anion, the energy density of AZIBs will be further improved. The activity of oxygen is enhanced by weakening the V–O covalence, which can effectively achieve oxygen redox behavior in vanadium-based cathodes. Also, the electron density of oxygen can be increased via introducing P–O covalence into the layers of the VxOy polyhedrons, since the P–O covalence is weaker than the V–O covalence.37 As a result, VOPO4 was first chosen as the cathode for aqueous ZIBs.
Vanadium phosphates are inorganic compounds with a formula of VOxPO4 or VOxPO4·nH2O containing hydrates. The vanadium phosphate VOPO4 displays a typical layered structure, which consists of corner-sharing VO6 octahedra connected to the PO4 tetrahedra.38 Compared with the traditional vanadium-based cathodes, VOPO4, which has a rational structure, not only enables a high voltage platform (∼1.8 V) and ∼27% extra capacity through additional oxygen redox reactions, but also increases the energy density by 36% (Fig. 2a).39 The 2D tunnels formed between the layers are beneficial for the diffusion and (de)intercalation of ions. For example, the attraction between vanadium and oxygen is weakened since the oxygens in the VO6 octahedra lose electrons in the fully charged state. This consequently leads to an increase in the layer spacing (Fig. 2b). In the low-voltage region (0.8–1.8 V), Zn2+ inserts/is extracted into/from the VOPO4 with reversible conversion of the valence of vanadium between V5+ and V4+ during the charge/discharge process. When the voltage range is broadened to the higher region (1.8–2.1 V), only the redox of lattice oxygen occurs in the VOPO4, without the action of Zn2+.

The strong electrostatic attraction between Zn2+ and negatively charged oxygen causes shrinkage of the layer spacing with the continuous intercalation of Zn2+, resulting in poor cycling stability. Additionally, the massive intercalation of ions and the irreversible dissolution of active substances in an aqueous electrolyte destroy the layered structure of vanadyl phosphates, exacerbating the cycling problem. Thus, modification of the layered structure has become a research focus. Rational strategies, e.g., the introduction of water molecules, metal cations or polymer molecules into the layered frameworks, can enhance the structural strength and provide additional electrochemical advantages during operation.23,24,36,40–42 Furthermore, tuning the structure can also enhance the ionic conductivity and kinetics, leading to improved electrochemical performance as cathodes in AZIBs. In view of the different roles played by the intercalated substances during the synthesis process, they are discussed by classification below.
Water molecules
Tietze revealed the crystal structure of vanadyl phosphate dihydrate (VOPO4·2H2O) in 1981.43 It is described as a structure with stacked VO(OH)2PO4 layers along the c-axis, with the water molecules occupying the large interlayer spacing (Fig. 2c). Each VO(OH)2PO4 layer is composed of VO6 octahedrons and PO4 tetrahedrons arranged in a 1:1 order to form a two-dimensional rock-salt arrangement.44 The VO6 octahedron consists of a vanadium ion center and six oxygen atoms with slightly different bond lengths. Four V–O bonds are located on the equatorial plane or ab plane, and the oxygen atoms are shared with the PO4 tetrahedron. An extended hydrogen-bonding network can be generated in this structure, which enhances the trapping ability of the discrete water molecules in the interlayers.24 Nevertheless, the weakened binding energy between the VO(OH)2PO4 layer and the water molecules is not enough to fix it, and thus the overall structure presents a dynamic process.45
Layered VOPO4·2H2O was reported as a cathode for AZIBs, which demonstrated that its tunable layer spacing could accommodate intercalated Zn2+ in an aqueous electrode.39 Wang et al. stated that VOPO4·2H2O is a Zn2+ intercalation host and concluded that the water molecules at the electrolyte/electrode interface play a crucial role in the diffusion of Zn2+ and enhance its electrochemical activity and reversibility.36 Further studies also demonstrated that the strong inductive effect of the polyanions enables it to achieve a higher redox potential than conventional vanadium oxides.28,46–48 However, serious voltage decay was found during long-term cyclic measurements, which reflects the structural instability of VOPO4·2H2O. This phenomenon originated from the fact that the phosphate groups can be easily irreversibly dissolved in 3 M Zn(CF3SO3)2, which then led to the gradual structure transformation into VOx.29 Accordingly, Sun et al. proposed that the use of a mixed electrolyte containing 13 M ZnCl2 + 0.8 M H3PO4 instead would suppress the turnover of PO42− in VOPO4·2H2O by increasing the concentration in the electrolyte, which was strongly confirmed by the significant improvements in the voltage platforms and reversibility over 500 cycles after the introduction of PO42− (Fig. 2d).29
Hu et al. developed a bilayer-structured VOPO4·2H2O nanosheet with a high concentration of oxygen vacancies through a facile liquid exfoliation synthesis strategy.31 The unique ultrathin bilayer–VOP retained the initial phase well after long-term cycling and inhibited the decomposition/dissolution of VOPO4·2H2O. In addition, the high concentration of oxygen vacancies in the novel 2D bilayer VOPO4·2H2O effectively promoted the transport properties of Zn2+, showing a typical (de)intercalation mechanism for Zn2+. It is worth noting that the layer spacing decreases in the discharge process owing to the increasing electrostatic attraction between the intercalated Zn2+ and the oxygen in the layers (Fig. 2e).31 Additionally, Zhang et al. proposed a large-scale synthetic route based on the solid-state reaction of VOPO4·2H2O, which delivered a rate capability of 90 and 75 mA h g−1 at 2 and 5 A g−1, respectively, and stable cycling over 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 76%.32 This initial report demonstrates its potential for mass production.
The conventional reflux method has inspired a modification scheme using water molecules as the interlayer medium in vanadyl phosphate. However, both the improved structural stability provided by pre-intercalated H2O as well as the abridged conductivity and slow kinetics caused by the electrostatic interaction of the molecular grid need to be considered comprehensively.
Cationic doping
Strategies involving the partial replacement of the structural water in VOPO4·2H2O and directly intercalation in VOPO4 by cationic are also feasible. Additionally, the wide variety of metal ions also provides infinite possibilities for designing vanadyl phosphate derivatives with more open layer spacing and enhanced electronic conductivity. Wu et al. reported Zn0.4VOPO4 synthesized via a topochemical route. The introduction of divalent Zn2+ in the host lattice exhibited no obvious influence on the in-plane arrangement or coordination environment of the layered structure (Fig. 3a).23 Notably, a slightly narrowed layered spacing (7.0 Å vs. 7.4 Å in the VOPO4·2H2O) was obtained in Zn0.4VOPO4·0.8H2O, owing to the strong electrostatic attraction between the inserted Zn2+ and oxygen in the [VOPO4] host layer. The corresponding Zn2+ (de)intercalation mechanism of the Zn0.4VOPO4·0.8H2O cathode is as follows:

This structure stably stored 0.44 units of Zn2+ during discharge and achieved 72% capacity retention over 1000 cycles. Similarly, lamellar KVOPO4 was successfully prepared by the substitution of K+ for water molecules through a hydrothermal method. The layer spacing decreased due to the greater intercalation of guest ions (Fig. 3b).40 It has been proved that the intercalation of K+ has a positive effect on promoting the rapid migration of Zn2+ and significantly enhancing the electrical conductivity of KVOPO4.
Compared with water molecules, the enlargement of interlayer spacing by the introduction of cations seems to be more limited. What is more valuable is that a stable Zn2+ (de)intercalation process is realized because of the stronger electrostatic interaction provided by the positive valence electron environment. This characteristic helps to attenuate volume change and further extend the cycle life. Unfortunately, the close relationship between the choice of cations and energy storage mechanisms has not been presented in-depth.
Organic molecule doping
Due to the dense charge distribution of the pre-intercalated metal ions, highly conductive organic polymers show the potential to expand the layer spacing further. Verma V et al. emphasized that for the rational design of open-layer structures, both the integrity of the host structure and the electrode–electrolyte compatibility of polypyrrole-intercalated VOPO4 (PPy–VOPO4) must be taken into account.24 The layer spacing (6.72 Å) shows slight shrinkage in PPy–VOPO4 because of the complete replacement of water molecules. The resulting battery with PPy–VOPO4 as the cathode and a nonaqueous electrolyte (2 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 in acetonitrile) can operate stably for 350 cycles (Fig. 3c). These results indicate that the effective limitation of water activity is beneficial for improving cycling stability. Additionally, Hu et al. proposed a solvothermal method for the pre-intercalation of phenylamine (PA) in VOPO4·2H2O, in which the lattice spacing of the (001) crystal planes shows an apparent positive correlation with the treatment time (Fig. 3d).42 The climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method indicates that the energy barrier for Zn2+ in the as-optimized diffusion path (through the site between the [VO6] octahedron and [PO4] tetrahedron) decreases significantly as the layer spacing increases. Combined with a single Zn2+ (de)intercalation involving chelation reaction, the cathodes with a spacing of 16.5 Å exhibit improved reaction kinetics, the highest reversible capacity (200.9 mA h g−1 initially at 5 A g−1 with a retention of 92.3% after 2000 cycles), and diffusion coefficient (∼5.7 × 10−8 cm−2 s−1) (Fig. 3e and f).
Most of the organic species that have been pre-intercalated in VOPO4 achieve an increase in the interlayer spacing, but a few species, including polypyrrole, also make the inner space more crowded. Hence, it is necessary to rationally consider the pre-intercalated species to keep the layered structure intact and avoid structural distortion in the host structure during repeated Zn2+ (de)intercalation. Also, there is still a lack of deep research into the interactions between the pre-intercalated organic molecules and the basic structural units, and both their selection in the preparation and the irreversible phase transition caused by the disintegration of PO43− during operation deserve attention.
NASICON-type phosphates
Over the past decade, polyanion compounds have attracted considerable attention as promising cathode candidates in both aqueous and nonaqueous LIBs (and SIBs) based on open Li+ and Na+ diffusion channels.49–51 Recently, polyanion compounds have been partially applied in aqueous ZIBs. The special attraction of the NASICON-type M3V2(PO4)3 (M = Li, Na) lies in the thermodynamic stability, potential efficient diffusion in the 3D frameworks and high operating voltage plateau range.27,33,34,52,53 Based on the particularity of the phosphates with NASICON-type structure (e.g., Li3V2(PO4)3, Na3V2(PO4)3), their relationship with the Zn2+ storage mechanism is discussed in detail below.
Li3V2(PO4)3
Li3V2(PO4)3 has two skeletal structures, the rhombohedral phase and the monoclinic phase (Fig. 4a),54–56 which are distinguished by the connection of the “lantern” units [V2(PO4)3]. In the rhombohedral phase, the [V2(PO4)3] units, which consist of VO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra connected by vertices, stack along the [001] direction with lithium in a special four-fold coordination crystallographic site.57 On the other hand, the monoclinic phase is characterized by the 3D framework of O vertices and Li+ shared by the VO6 octahedrons and PO4 tetrahedrons in the interstitial space.58 The structural differences lead to their different properties. For instance, the monoclinic phase, which has a higher density, is more thermodynamically stable. More importantly, the three mobile Li+ in the monoclinic phase make it superior to the rhombohedral phase in terms of electrochemical performance, causing it to be more valuable for research.59 Hence, the term LVP below refers to Li3V2(PO4)3 with the monoclinic phase unless otherwise stated.

(f) Schematic illustration of hydrated gel electrolyte preparation.66 Copyright (2021), Wiley-VCH GmbH. 
The demonstration of the feasibility of LVP in AZIB applications by Zhao et al. in 2016 sparked tremendous interest in researchers.34 Additionally, the deteriorated cyclic reversibility and short-lived defects are also more prominent. With the above concerns in mind, Sun et al. proposed a hybrid electrolyte combination (water–acetonitrile solvent) to improve electrochemical activity and cycling performance.27 The LVP undergoes phase transformation into VOPO4 in the electrolyte with an appropriate content of water, which acts as a host to maintain stable (de)intercalation of Zn2+. Similarly, Li et al. explored the effect of the introduction of LiTFSI to the electrolyte on the inhibition of LVP dissolution and the control of side reactions in an aqueous solution.25 Three pairs of redox peaks are observed in the CV curves, corresponding to the multi-step (de)intercalation process of Li+ in the cathode, whose stability and reversibility are enhanced with increasing LiTFSI content (Fig. 4b). Accordingly, a hybrid battery based on Li+ insertion/extraction as the cathodic reaction and Zn2+ stripping/plating as the anodic reaction was proposed, and achieved a capacity retention of 82.3% over 2000 cycles in 1 M Zn(OTf)2 + 15 M LiTFSI electrolyte. However, Li et al. found that LVP would undergo irreversible decomposition in 4 M Zn(OTf)2 due to H+ intercalation.60 Therefore, a PEG/H2O cosolvent mainly composed of high-concentration polyethylene glycol 400 (denoted as PEG 400) was designed to reduce the H2O activity and inhibit the H+ intercalation at the cathode interface effectively. Furthermore, a combination of Zn(CF3SO3)2 and LiTFSI was also prepared by Wu et al. to assemble Zn/LVP batteries with a high capacity retention rate of 89% at 30 °C and a coulombic efficiency of 95% even at a high temperature of 80 °C.61 It greatly broadened the application of ZIBs in high-temperature fields. From the perspective of stabilizing the cathodes structure, Xiong et al. tackled the side reaction of the electrolyte. They maintained the stable structure of LVP effectively by fabricating high crystallinity LVP@C as a cathode for ZIBs.33 The crystallinity of the carbon coating at the LVP surface was so high that it not only significantly improved the conductivity of the electrode, but also effectively inhibited the side reaction of the electrolyte (Fig. 4c).
Na3V2(PO4)3
Unlike Li3V2(PO4)3, the foundation frame structure of Na3V2(PO4)3 with the rhombohedral phase (denoted as NVP) consists of VO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra connected by corner-sharing. There are two kinds of Na+ in the NVP crystal structure; each PO4 tetrahedra is connected by two VO6 octahedra and Na1, whereas Na2 resides only between two VO6 octahedra (2 Na2 in the 18e position and 1 Na1 in the 6b position).62 By comparing the Na–O bond lengths, it is found that the occupancy of the Na2 site is smaller than that of Na1, making its corresponding Na+ more easily extracted during the electrochemical process.63
The NVP with NASICON structure as an intercalation host for Zn2+ was first reported by Li et al. in 2016,52 who conducted a preliminary study of the energy storage behavior of this cathode. Two Na+ were extracted from the NVP framework and released two electrons during the charging process, which were re-inserted into the NaV2(PO4)3 matrix with Zn2+ intercalation and formed ZnxNaV2(PO4)3 upon subsequent discharging. The assembled battery exhibited a reversible capacity of 72 mA h g−1 in the 100th cycle with a capacity retention of 74%, showing its potential for divalent metal ions. Zhao et al. presented a more complex electrochemical mechanism of NVP in an aqueous electrolyte containing Li+ and Zn2+, in which the pH value and concentrations of the components of the aqueous electrolyte directly affected the cycling stability of the cathode.34 A weakly acidic environment with a pH of around 4–5 and a Li+:Zn2+ ratio of 1:2 achieved better electrochemical performance. Additionally, Huang et al. designed a high-conductivity cathode using NVP coated with carbon and reduced graphene oxide (denoted as C-G-NVP), which was combined with an aqueous electrolyte with Na+ and Zn2+.53 The conductive scaffold formed by the uniform attachment of reduced graphene oxide provided active sites for NVP particle growth while enhancing charge transfer. Based on this cathode design, Mai et al. reported the suitability of single-component 2 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 instead of a hybrid aqueous electrolyte on NVP@rGO (Fig. 4d).26 It was more intuitive to detect the co-(de)intercalation process of Na+ and Zn2+ during operation. The specific reaction formulas are as follows:    
Benefiting from the irreversible reaction in the first cycle with improved structural stability, the Zn/NVP@rGO battery manifested an ideal specific capacity of 114 mA h g−1, an enhanced average potential window of 1.23 V and a cycle life of 200 cycles.
However, the unsatisfactory cycling life of NVP is a complex problem. It is generally believed that its capacity fading is closely related to the transition from high crystallinity to nanocrystalline during cycling.64 At the same time, Yang et al. observed the spontaneous dissolution and generation of Zn3(PO4)2 and VOPO4 on the surface of NVP immersed in a static aqueous electrolyte, which should be responsible for the rapid capacity decay.30 In this way, a nonaqueous Na/Zn dual-salt electrolyte was designed, and its feasibility was also confirmed (Fig. 4e). Surprisingly, the Zn/NVP battery retained 100% of the initial capacity after 600 cycles at 0.5 A g−1. This work provides a new strategy for inhibiting the dissolution of active substances in the cathode. Subsequently, Guo et al. suggested that adopting polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the polymer additive on the basis of dual-salt electrolyte could form a fluoride-rich cathode-electrolyte interphase layer. It is beneficial to inhibiting the decomposition of NVP and facilitating the ion transportation.65 Additionally, a hydrated gel electrolyte (HGE) was proposed by Lin et al. to inhibit the side reaction occurring at the interface of water and anodic zinc (Fig. 4f).66 When NASICON-type Sr-doped Na3V2(PO4)3 was adopted as the cathode, the full cell exhibited a remarkable capacity (90 mA h g−1 at 10 C) and long-term cycling stability (over 8000 cycles). A Zn/NVP@C battery with 4 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte reported by Heng et al. exhibited an ideal rate performance and an excellent capacity of 77.8% at 2000 mA h g−1 over 1000 cycles.67 The higher concentration of the electrolyte effectively inhibits the activity of water molecules, thereby slowing the disintegration of the cathode and improving the interface of the anode.
It is undeniable that as polyanionic cathode materials, both Li3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)3 possess a stable conductive framework for long-term cycling and exhibit a higher redox voltage than their common binary oxide analogues due to their inducing effect. Nevertheless, balancing the stability of the active components while allowing as many energy storage ions to be inserted into the vacancies as possible is a challenge at present.
NASICON-type phosphate analogues
The studies based on Li3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)3 highlight that NASICON-type materials with suitable diffusion channels and guest ion attachment sites show Zn2+ storage ability. Therefore, analogues of NASICON-type phosphates (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)2F3) have been investigated thoroughly, as described individually below.
Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) with a fluorophosphate lattice structure is formed from the rhombohedral NASICON structure by replacing one (PO4)3− from NVP with three fluorine ions (Fig. 5a). Thanks to the inductive effect of the F atoms, NVPF has a more stable structure and higher intercalation voltage than NVP, and excellent thermal stability, low volume change, and structural deformation are also obtained.68,69 Li et al. synthesized carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (N3VPF@C) and combined it with modified anodic zinc with low dendrite formation and self-corrosion to investigate its energy storage behavior.70 The irreversible reaction in the initial cycle drives one unit of Na+ out of N3VPF@C and forms N2VPF@C, into which 0.5 units of Zn2+ then reversibly insert to form Zn0.5Na2V2(PO4)2F3 (Zn0.5N2VPF), corresponding to the results observed in Fig. 5b. The obtained Zn/N3VPF@C battery not only provided a high output voltage of 1.62 V with a remarkable energy density of 97.5 W h kg−1, but also maintained excellent cyclability (95% capacity retention after 4000 cycles at a specific current density of 1 A g−1). In addition, MJ Park et al. proposed different charge storage mechanisms for NVPF cathodes in aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes.71 Specifically, partially extracted Na+ in a nonaqueous environment will re-enter the structure as Zn2+ intercalates, which will be weakened with the progress of cycling. This eventually leads to the transformation of the guest ions participating in the reaction from Zn2+/Na+ to only Zn2+ (Fig. 5c). In Zn(CF3SO3)2 aqueous solution, the formation of zinc salt by-products masked the fact that Zn2+ is the guest ion while H+ is the real active ion. Overall, the difference in the electrolyte environment can bring about various charge storage behaviors of the cathode. Consequently, a more comprehensive analysis should be carried out when exploring the AZIBs.

Among materials with the formula Na3V2(PO4)2F3−2yO2y (0 ≤ y ≤ 1), Na3V2(PO4)2O1.6F1.4 was selected as the cathode to match a water-in-salt electrolyte (25 M ZnCl2 + 5 M NH4Cl) by Wu et al.72 This system achieved an initial capacity of 139 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with a high coulombic efficiency of 99.7%, which was attributed to the participation of Zn2+ and a small number of protons during cycling. The chemical formula for this process is as follows:Cathode:    H2O ↔ H+ + OH−  Anode:(y + z/2) Zn ↔ (y + z/2) Zn2+ + (2y + z) e−.
Furthermore, the high concentration of electrolytes can slow the structural damage to Na3V2(PO4)2O1.6F1.4 by free water molecules, and the pH-neutral electrolyte effectively improves the kinetic properties and ensures the structural stability of the polyanion-type cathodes (Fig. 5d). Beyond that, a novel full cell with Zn2+ pre-intercalated Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (Zn–NVPOF) and MoO2 with inserted nitrogen-doped carbon (MoO2@NC) as the cathode and anode was assembled.73 The fabricated cell presented an energy density of 45.1 W h kg−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and a stable capacity of 49 mA h g−1 after 8000 cycles (with capacity retention of 91%) at 1 A g−1.
As a typical NASICON variant, NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP) shows weaker conductivity than NVP. However, its looser framework allows more guest ions to be accommodated and provides faster ion migration, which is enhanced by a lower migration barrier. Commonly used cathode modification strategies, such as adding conductive agents or reducing the particle size of the active components, can improve the conductivity of electrodes to a certain extent. Based on this, Zhu et al. fabricated a full cell with anodic NTP@Zn foil and cathodic CNT/MnO2, which retained a reversible capacity of 128 mA h g−1 over 600 cycles at 5 C with a single-cycle coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% (Fig. 5e).74 In addition, Na3MnTi(PO4)3 with low toxicity and cost-efficiency, which was used as a cathode by Hou et al. in a novel rechargeable hybrid sodium–zinc battery, has attracted attention.75 In contrast to most polyanionic-type cathodes, this cathode exhibits an irreversible process of Na+ extraction from the host structure and the formation of NaxMnTi(PO4)3 in the first cycle. This new phase undergoes (de)intercalation of predominantly Na+ and a tiny amount of Zn2+ in the following cycles, together with the plating/stripping process of anodic zinc, which constitutes a closed electron transport path (Fig. 5f). Impressively, a hybrid battery with a non-modified anode exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 59.4 mA h g−1 at 10 C and a capacity retention of 93.6% after 2000 cycles. The revealed hybrid Na+ and Zn2+ reaction mechanisms also provide a feasible avenue for designing stable and efficient aqueous NASICON-type batteries.
So far, polyanionic-type compounds have high lattice stability and multiple active sites but poor electrical conductivity. In terms of energy storage behavior, achieving the stable (de)intercalation of as many guest ions as possible, rationally controlling the irreversible reaction in the first cycle, and avoiding the dissolution of active substances from the cathode into the electrode have become the main issues.
Finally, the main electrochemical parameters of the previously discussed phosphate cathodes are summarized in Table 2 for a more intuitive comparison.

Conclusions and outlook
The phosphate-based materials reported as cathodes for AZIBs to date exhibit various crystal structures and properties, such as typical layered vanadyl phosphate compounds with high zinc ion storage capacity and NASICON-type materials with wstable structural frameworks and ideal thermal stability. In this review, the common modification methods for phosphate-based materials for use as cathodes for AZIBs and the corresponding energy storage behaviors were summarized. In general, layered vanadyl phosphates can accommodate more guest ions thanks to their sufficient interior space, while vanadium phosphates exhibit a high operating voltage platform. Mechanistically, both layered vanadyl phosphate compounds and NASICON-type materials exhibit basic ion (de)intercalation behavior, cooperating with the Zn2+ plating/stripping process in the anode to form a closed charge transport path. Additionally, the irreversible phase transition in the first cycle and possible synergistic Zn2+ (de)intercalation of additional ions (e.g., Li+, Na+) occurring in vanadium phosphates should be distinguished. It is also urgent to address the specific challenges for various structured phosphate-based cathodes. Herein, we propose three perspectives for these materials:
(1) Further improving the reversible capacity and cycling stability based on maintenance of the high voltage characteristics of the phosphate-based cathodes
The broader space within layered vanadyl phosphates enables the accommodation of more intercalated guest ions, but these materials generally exhibit a lower operating voltage range similar to that of vanadium oxides. Therefore, it is essential to exert the inductive effect of the polyanion PO43−. In contrast, more in-depth investigation into vanadium phosphates (especially the polyanionic-type compounds) is needed to fully combine the advantages of these two types of materials and enable synergetic effects.
(2) Exploring more rational options for ion doping
The improvements resulting from the intercalation of water molecules or cations in layered vanadyl phosphates, both of which act as “pillars” within the framework to stabilize the layered structure, are obvious. The high conductivity of water molecules and the weakened charge transfer resistance of existing cations also promote the diffusion of Zn2+ inside. On the other hand, anion doping of NASICON-type materials can enhance their structural stability. The optimization of the doping parameters (e.g., species, amounts) according to the chemical properties of the elements to obtain products with high ionic conductivity and a stable molecular structure remains to be investigated.
(3) Optimization of electrolyte strategy
It has been demonstrated that the use of appropriate component ratios in multicomponent salt electrolytes can promote the (de)intercalation of Zn2+ at the cathode–electrolyte interface by suppressing the water activity. The use of flexible (e.g., gel, solid state) electrolytes offers the possibility for functionalized applications. However, balancing the interface stability, the suppression of side reactions with proper mobility, and the activity of the energy storage media should be the primary considerations in electrolyte design.
Vanadium/vanadyl-based electrodes are believed to be equally competitive with manganese-based cathodes in AZIBs with a high operating voltage platform. We hope that this review will shed light for future investigations of phosphate cathodes for AZIBs in large-scale energy storage systems.
