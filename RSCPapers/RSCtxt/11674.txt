    , Accepted 28th October 2021First published on 28th October 2021AbstractNew types of rechargeable batteries other than lithium-ions, including sodium/potassium/zinc/magnesium/calcium/aluminum-ion batteries and non-aqueous batteries, are rapidly advancing towards large-scale energy storage applications. A major challenge for these burgeoning batteries is the absence of appropriate electrode materials, which gravely hinders their further development. Expanded graphite (EG)-based electrode materials have been proposed for these emerging batteries due to their low cost, non-toxic, rich-layered structure and adjustable layer spacing. Here, we evaluate and summarize the application of EG-based materials in rechargeable batteries other than Li+ batteries, including alkaline ion (such as Na+, K+) storage and multivalent ion (such as Mg2+, Zn2+, Ca2+ and Al3+) storage batteries. Particularly, this article discusses the composite strategy and performance of EG-based materials, which enables them to function as an electrode in these emerging batteries. Future research areas in EG-based materials, from the fundamental understanding of material design and processing to reaction mechanisms and device performance optimization strategies, are being looked forward to.
1. Introduction
Environmentally friendly renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and tides are becoming increasingly crucial for global sustainable development.1,2 However, these renewable energy sources are inherently intermittent and unevenly distributed, necessitating the use of energy storage devices.3,4 Electrochemical energy storage devices have the benefits of high energy conversion efficiency, long service life, high energy and power density, and low maintenance costs, which are vital in satisfying the rapidly growing requirements of the portable equipment, electric vehicles, grid storage and fixed equipment markets.5–12 Since Sony's successful commercialization in 1991, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have dominated the energy storage system market.13,14 Despite the success of LIBs in consumer electronics and electric vehicles, Li resources are limited (only 20 ppm in the Earth's crust), thus, safety issues and high costs impede the application of LIBs on a grid scale.2,15,16 Therefore, exploring more sustainable rechargeable battery technologies, which are projected to use the available and non-toxic metals to lower prices and environmental impact, is a tremendous incentive.
Diversified rechargeable batteries, such as monovalent Na+ batteries (NIBs),17–21 K+ batteries (KIBs),22–26 divalent Zn2+ batteries (ZIBs),27–30 Mg2+ batteries (MIBs),31–34 Ca2+ batteries (CIBs),35–38 and trivalent Al3+ batteries (AIBs),39–42 have demonstrated significant potential for energy storage. These non-lithium metals are more abundant than lithium, especially aluminum, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium, which are all among the top eight abundant elements in the Earth's crust. Aluminum-foil can be employed as an anode collector for NIBs and KIBs since aluminum does not form an alloy with sodium and potassium, further reducing the prices of NIBs and KIBs. Moreover, Na/Na+ {−2.71 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)} and K/K+ (−2.93 V) have higher standard potentials and heavier atomic masses, making the energy densities of NIBs and KIBs substantially lower than that of LIBs. For multivalent ion batteries, the multi-electron transfer makes their volume capacity (e.g., 5857 and 8056 mA h cm−3 for zinc and aluminum, respectively) higher than that of lithium (2042 mA h cm−3).43,44 Additionally, Zn2+ (0.74 Å), Mg2+ (0.72 Å) and Al3+ (0.54 Å) indicate that several intercalation electrode materials in LIB may also be potential hosts for the reversible intercalation of these multivalent ions (Fig. 1). Based on the aforementioned advantages, these emerging rechargeable batteries are considered promising alternatives to LIBs.

The performance of electrode materials, a key rechargeable battery component, is crucial. The redox potential, charge transfer number, electronic conductivity, crystal structure stability and element abundance should all be considered when exploring appropriate electrode materials.45 Various electrode materials have been developed thus far. The EG-based electrode material, for example, is a typical carbon material that has piqued people's interest. This electrode material has a rich-layered structure and an adjustable interlayer spacing, which facilitates the insertion and extraction of metal ions, thereby producing higher specific capacity and energy density. Additionally, its cost-effectiveness and green nature make them ideal for large-scale practical applications. Therefore, it is critical to conduct a timely and comprehensive review of current EG-based material development for emerging electrochemical energy-storage device applications. However, review articles on the use of EG-based materials in non-LIBs are limited. In this article, we will first briefly introduce EG and further outline the preparation strategy for EG-based composites. Next, we focus on current developments in the use of EG-based materials for rechargeable batteries other than LIBs, including alkaline ion (such as Na+, K+) storage and multivalent ion (such as Mg2+, Zn2+, Ca2+ and Al3+) storage batteries. Finally, we present our perspectives on current challenges and concerns, as well as future research directions.
2. A brief introduction of EG and composite strategies
EG is obtained using graphite as a raw material, with suitable chemical substances intercalated between graphite layers in various ways (Fig. 2a). EG has a rich layered structure, adjustable interlayer spacing, stable chemical performance, high adsorption, high shock resistance, high resilience and many other excellent properties. It is widely used in military, machinery, environmental protection, medicine and electric power fields. In addition to these fields, EG also has good application prospects in heat preservation materials, sound insulation materials, heat dissipation materials, and flame retardant and fireproof materials.46 At the same time, the EG-based composite material facilitates the insertion and extraction of metal ions, resulting in higher specific capacity and energy density. EG was first reported in the literature in 1841 when Schafhautl analyzed graphite wafers in a sulfuric acid solution; researchers have begun exploring the synthesis and application of EG ever since.46,47 Currently, the technology for preparing EG can be roughly divided into two categories, namely, chemical and physical methods. Chemical methods mainly include chemical oxidation48 and electrochemical methods (Fig. 2b).49 Furthermore, the chemical oxidation method is more widely used, but it requires the use of powerful oxidants in the preparation process which produce pollutants, thus limiting its use. Moreover, the electrochemical method has attracted widespread interest due to its speed, efficiency and environmental friendliness. However, this method employs a graphite foil or graphite paper as an electrode and requires additional steps for further processing of the raw material graphite powder material. Moreover, the physical method mainly includes the high/low-temperature expansion method50,51 and microwave52 and ultrasonic methods.53 The high/low-temperature expansion method is currently the most widely used method, but its drawbacks include excessive energy consumption, inert gas protection and high equipment requirements. The microwave method for preparing EG is fast and efficient, but it consumes excess energy and is difficult to scale up, limiting its industrial application. The ultrasonic preparation of EG requires the use of specific solvents and has the problem of poor yield. EG can be prepared in various ways. The structure and surface chemical state of EG vary depending on the process used, which significantly impacts its electrochemical behavior and performance. Therefore, selecting a suitable EG synthesis method based on the final purpose is significant to the development of Li-based battery materials.

EG-based composite materials exhibit excellent characteristics in the field of electrochemical energy storage. However, different composite processing methods result in different performances. Therefore, understanding composite strategies is beneficial for Li-based batteries. Currently, the composite processing methods for EG-based materials are mainly the chemical54,55 and physical methods aforementioned (Fig. 3).56–62 Chemical methods for the synthesis of EG-based composites include solvothermal54 and sol–gel methods,55 such as metal oxide/EG,54,63 carbon coating/EG64–66 and conductive polymer coating/EG.67 The solvothermal and sol–gel methods are often used due to their simple operation and high reproducibility. However, the application of physical methods in EG-based composites is limited due to several drawbacks, such as high energy consumption, high equipment requirements and weak binding force to EG. Moreover, the physical methods mainly include freezing,59 calcination,57 ball milling61,62 and atomic layer deposition,53 which are used to construct metal/EG,56 metal oxide/EG,58 non-metal oxide/EG,60 and carbon coating/EG.51,59 The EG-based complex can be prepared in a variety of ways. The use of different methods leads to changes in the structure of the EG-based composite, which has a great impact on its electrochemical behavior and performance. Therefore, choosing a suitable EG-based composite synthesis method according to the final purpose is of great significance to the development of the best material.

3. NIBs
As an alternative technology for LIBs, NIBs have similar low potentials to Na (−2.71 V vs. SHE) and Li (−3.04 V vs. SHE) and are rich in Na content and less expensive.18,19 They have significant potential in the next generation of large-scale energy storage.17,20 The potential applications of EG anodes in NIBs are chiefly in the range of 0.5–1.3 V vs. Na/Na+.69 The generated full NIBs can offer up a voltage of 2–2.8 V when combined with the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode with a stable voltage platform at approximately 3.3 V vs. Na/Na+.70 Unfortunately, the cation radius of Na+ is 1.06 Å larger than that of Li+ (0.76 Å), which results in slower sodiation–desodiation kinetics as well as severe volume expansion.71,72 Consequently, the development of EG with high conductivity, adjustable interlayer spacing and a low Na+ diffusion barrier has introduced new opportunities for the construction of novel electrodes for high-performance NIBs.
EG, a derivative of graphite, is the first to be mentioned as the anode of NIBs. Cabello et al. prepared EG by thermal expansion; Broddie and Hummer's modified EG processing methods and compared them with natural graphite in terms of structure, morphology and electrochemical performance.73 X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy (RS) confirmed the presence of graphite oxide intermediates and revealed the influence of different reduced forms of EG on Na insertion properties. The thermally processed EG increased the capacity and efficiency from 100 to 115 mA h g−1 and from 93 to 96%, respectively, over 100 cycles when cycled at a 1C-rate compared to natural graphite. Ex situ XRD patterns reveal the existence of a new set of reflections attributed to Na ordering in different stages as verified by the calculated Patterson diagrams. The graphite oxide was processed under an ammonia atmosphere to balance the oxygen- and the nitrogen-containing functional groups to obtain nitrogen-doped EG oxide (NEGO) (Fig. 4a).74 The electrochemical characterization of ether-based and ester-based electrolytes was systematically carried out, revealing the storage mechanism of NEGO in NIBs. The initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of NEGO in ether-based electrolytes increased from 24.73% to 72.08%. Additionally, the synthesized NEGO has capacities of 125 mA h g−1 and 110 mA h g−1 in ether-based and ester-based electrolytes, respectively, even at a high current density of 30 A g−1 (Fig. 4b). The excellent NEGO performance may be attributed to the high surface area with a defective structure and pseudo-capacitance introduced by oxygen and nitrogen active sites. Electrochemical kinetics analysis showed that when NEGO was employed in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, it exhibited capacitive behavior, leading to a high rate ability as well as high ICE compared with its performance in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate. EG has attracted widespread attention as a promising sodium ion storage anode. However, the sodiation–desodiation process has uncertainty. Li et al. prepared EG by a slightly modified Hummers’ method and subsequent thermal treatment, which was employed for NIBs (Fig. 4c).75 When EG was used as the anode of NIBs, it exhibited a reversible specific capacity of 171 mA h g−1 at 100 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. EG also maintains a reversible specific capacity of 100 mA h g−1 after 2600 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1 (Fig. 4d). Additionally, the electrochemical mechanism of how EG stores Na+ was studied using RS, which reveals the electrochemical reactions in different sodiation–desodiation processes. Kim et al. presented a preparative strategy for increasing the graphite interlayer distance along the c-axis to promote the intercalation of Na+ by implanting tungsten (W) metallic pillars between the graphene layers (Fig. 4e).68 The insertion of positively charged, highly oxidative W6+ ions facilitated the self-assembly of the negatively charged EG sheets by balancing the repulsive forces even at a low concentration. The W pillars increased the interlayer spacing of the EG materials to approximately 11 Å, thereby facilitating the facile insertion and extraction of Na+. The W–EG anode exhibited a high specific capacity of 678 mA h g−1, which was approximately three times higher than that of the pristine EG anode (240 mA h g−1) and it maintained considerable capacity even after 100 cycles (Fig. 4f). Kim et al. presented an EG material employing MoSx conversion reaction pillars (EG–MoSx) embedded in the interlayers and used it as an anode for NIBs (Fig. 4g).76 By changing the crystal structure of EG–MoSx under different heat treatment conditions, customized control of the insertion characteristics of single- and dual-phase reactions was successfully realized. The EG–MoSx-900 anode with an expanded interlayer of approximately 5.38 Å exhibits a high capacity of 501 mA h g−1 (Fig. 4h). Additionally, the irreversible capacity problem of the EG material was successfully solved by forming a chemically pre-formed solid electrolyte interface layer on the electrode surface, thereby improving the coulombic efficiency of thermally tuned EG–MoSx (52.20 → 97.25%).

Meanwhile, EG-based composite materials can also be used as cathode materials for NIBs. Li et al. designed and prepared hierarchical hollow spheres composed of interconnected few-layer MoS2 nanosheets with N-doped carbon coatings (MoS2@NC HHSs) (Fig. 5a).77 The NIB full cell was constructed using MoS2@NC HHSs as an anode, EG as a cathode and 1.0 M NaPF6 in EC/DMC/EMC (volume ratio 1:1:1) as the electrolyte. The synergistic effect of the ultra-thin MoS2 subunit, hollow interior and N-doped carbon coating not only promoted the reaction kinetics and capacity-controlled sodium storage but also ensured excellent mechanical stability during the Na+ insertion–deintercalation process. The MoS2@NC HHS-based NIBs delivered a high reversible capacity of 45 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 and exhibited good cycling stability with a stable reversible capacity of 40 mA h g−1 as well as high coulombic efficiency beyond 90% at 1 A g−1 for 500 cycles (Fig. 5b). Gu et al. prepared Na3V2(PO4)3 NVP/C cathodes with various carbon matrixes (NVP/EG, NVP/carbon nanotubes (NVP/CNT), and a NVP/carbon black (NVP/CB)) composite material using ball milling, freeze-drying and calcination methods and employed them as the cathode in NIBs.78 NVP/EG outperformed the others, exhibiting Na storage ability due to the complete three-dimensional carbon networks; the as-synthesized NVP/EG composite exhibited a high reversible capacity of 111.4 mA h g−1 at 1C, excellent rate performance (105 mA h g−1 at 50C) and long cycling stability (48 mA h g−1 after 20000 cycles at 50C). Liu et al. adopted a solvothermal approach to produce a coral-like nano-hybrid material for Na+ storage made up of atomic MoS2 nanosheets modified by layered layers of nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon films (a-MoS2 NS@NSCfilm), which enabled it to maximize atomic interface contact, impair the diffusion energy barrier of Na+ ions/electrons, improve electrical conductivity and decrease volume variation effects.79 Consequently, a-MoS2NS@NSCfilm as an anode for NIBs by coupling it with an EG cathode exhibited a capacity of 40 mA h g−1 with excellent cycling stability and an high capacity retention of 99.9944% per cycle after 5000 cycles at 10C. Novel hierarchical MoSe2 yolk–shell spheres (MoSe2 YSs) assembled using ultra-thin nanosheets as anode materials for the NDIBs were prepared via the selenization of Mo–glycerate solid spheres with subsequent thermal annealing.80 The ultrathin feature of nanosheet subunits with expanded (002) interlayer spacing and an entire yolk–shell structure not only improved the reaction kinetics and high capacitive-controlled Na storage of MoSe2 YSs but also provided an effective buffer that eliminates volume change during Na+ intercalation–deintercalation. The constructed NIB with MoSe2 YSs as the anode and EG as the cathode exhibited an excellent discharge performance of 70.1 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 after 120 cycles. Additionally, the constructed NIB exhibited good rate capability with a discharge capacity of 42.9 mA h g−1 and high coulombic efficiency beyond 93.5% at a current density of 2.0 A g−1. Zeng et al. developed a novel Na2FeP2O7@carbon/EG (NFPO@C/EG) composite material using a scalable sol–gel process and a ball milling process of EG (Fig. 5c).81 The NFPO@C/EG effectively improved the electronic conductivity while also shortening the Na+ transmission path due to its multiscale carbon-modified structure. Consequently, the NFPO@C/EG cathode had a substantially higher specific capacity and cycling performance than NFPO@C and NFPO. The uniquely synthesized NFPO@C/EG had a high ratio of pseudocapacitance contribution and a substantial Na+ diffusion coefficient. Thus, the NFPO@C/EG cathode exhibited a good cycling stability (82 mA h g−1 over 400 cycles at 232 mA g−1) and excellent rate performance (60 mA h g−1 at a high charge/discharge density of 2320 mA g−1) (Fig. 5d). The high-phosphorus-doped hollow hard carbon prepared by Wang et al. using a facile one-step approach has a high specific capacity and good rate performance (Fig. 5e).82 By controlling the P-configuration, the P–HCNs03 exhibited a high reversible capacity of 260 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 after 500 cycles, with an ICE of 73%. Based on the DFT calculation, the PO and P–C bonds possess higher Na-absorption energy. The excellent specific capacity of the P–HCNs03 electrode was due to its high proportion of PO and P–C bonds. The NIBs constructed with P–HCNs03 as the anode and EG as the cathode (P–HCNs03//EG) delivered a high energy density of 138 W h kg−1 at a power density of 159 W kg−1 (Fig. 5f).

EG and EG-based composite materials show excellent performance in NIBs not only as an anode but also as a cathode due to their excellent physical and chemical properties. However, the main reason limiting their further development in NIBs is the green, fast and efficient preparation of EG-based composites.
4. KIBs
Because K possess a lower potential (−2.93 V vs. SHE) which is similar to that of Li, KIBs have a higher theoretical capacity (687 mA h g−1) and a lower K cost, making them one of the LIB alternatives.22,25 However, the K+ radius is 0.138 nm, which is larger than that of Li+ (0.076 nm) and Na+ (0.106 nm), making it difficult to synthesize KIBs with suitable K+ matrix materials.36,38 The possibility of inserting K+ into EG with large interlayer spacing indicates that EG is a prospective anode material for high-capacity KIBs due to its adjustable interlayer spacing.
An et al. presented EG, a graphite-based material with excellent conductivity and expanded interlayer spaces to increase the ion diffusion coefficient during the charge/discharge process, as a KIB anode material.83 It has a capacity of 263 mA h g−1 at 10 mA g−1 and the reversible capacity remains almost unchanged after 500 cycles at 200 mA g−1, with a coulombic efficiency of around 100%. Additionally, the potassiation–depotassiation process of this EG was investigated by the ex situ XRD technique. A FeCl3–EG composite was prepared using molten salt and a subsequent H2O2 liquid-phase treatment method.84 The FeCl3–EG electrodes exhibited a capacity of 269.5 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and a high capacity of 133.1 mA h g−1 at 5000 mA g−1, which was ascribed to its distinct structure with FeCl3 sandwiched between the adjacent graphene layers. Moreover, the FeCl3–EG electrodes showed long cycling stability at 2000 mA g−1 with a capacity retention of 70.38% after 1300 cycles. Li et al. prepared high-performance mildly EG (MEG) anode materials for KIBs by adjusting the oxidant to natural graphite ratio and performing low-temperature annealing (Fig. 6a).85 The MEG anodes exhibited good cycling stability at 100 mA g−1 with a capacity retention of 72.3% after 200 cycles due to the expanded interlayer distance and well-maintained graphitic structure (Fig. 6b). Similar to natural graphite, the MEG anodes exhibited stable discharge/charge plateaus which guarantee high energy densities for full batteries. The K+ full cell employed with MEG anodes exhibited a high capacity retention of 81.3% after 100 cycles. Additionally, like in NIBs, EG can be used as the cathode in KIBs. Ji et al. combined the advantages of KIBs and dual-ion batteries, based on K+ electrolyte, employing metal foil (Sn, Pb, K and Na) as the anode and EG as the cathode, to develop a novel K+ double ion battery (KDIB).86 When using Sn foil was used as the anode, the KDIB delivered a high reversible capacity of 66 mA h g−1 at a 50 mA g−1 over the voltage window of 3.0–5.0 V and exhibited long cycling stability with 93% capacity retention for 300 cycles. Furthermore, the energy density of the packaged KDIB can be obviously improved due to the high working voltage and simultaneous usage of metal foil as the anode and current collector which reduces the battery's dead load and volume and it is estimated to be 155 W h kg−1 at a power density of 116 W kg−1, and 115 W h kg−1 at 678 W kg−1. Furthermore, Ji et al. developed a novel K+-electrolyte dual-carbon battery (KDCB) configuration coupling with a mesocarbon microbead anode and an EG cathode with K+ containing electrolyte {1 M KPF6 in EC/DMC/EMC mixture (4:3:2 v/v/v)} (Fig. 6c).87 The KDCB exhibited a reversible discharge capacity of 61 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1C with almost no capacity loss over the voltage window of 3.0–5.2 V, manifesting excellent structural stability and good cycling life (Fig. 6d). Furthermore, the high working voltage with a moderate discharge voltage of 4.5 V also enabled the KDCB to satisfy the demand of some high-voltage equipment. Ding et al. proposed a novel full battery called a K dual-ion hybrid battery (KDHB) that uses absorption-type hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) as the anode material, anion intercalated EG as the cathode material and 1 M KPF6 in the carbonate organic solvent as the electrolyte (Fig. 6e).88 The designed KDHB exhibited a high rate characteristic of about 3 A g−1 with reversible charge/discharge and negligible capacity decay due to the high specific surface area and hierarchical porous structure of the HPC anode, which enables fast and large absorption/desorption of K+. Additionally, the KDHB achieved excellent cycling stability, delivering a capacity of 63 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles at 1 A g−1 with 74.2% capacity retention (Fig. 6f).

At present, the application of EG-based materials in KIBs is mainly focused on the cathode. Moreover, a single EG is mostly used. At present, the application of EG-based materials in KIBs is mainly focused on the cathode. Moreover, a single EG is mostly used. In the follow-up research, the application of EG-based composites in KIBs should be expanded, and it should also be extended to anodes.
5. Multivalent metal ion batteries
Batteries based on monovalent metal ions (Mg2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Al3+, etc.) have unique characteristics such as fast charge transfer kinetics, large capacity and a high energy density advantage compared with batteries based on monovalent non-lithium metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, etc.).36,38 Unfortunately, the cation radius of multivalent metal ions is larger than that of their monovalent counterparts, making it more difficult to prepare multivalent metal ions batteries with suitable multivalent metal-ion matrix materials. As a result of the increased availability of EG with high conductivity, adjustable interlayer spacing and a low multivalent metal-ion diffusion barrier, new opportunities for the design of new electrodes for high-performance multivalent metal ion (Mg2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Al3+, etc.) batteries have emerged.
5.1. MIBs
As an emerging battery technology, a typical rechargeable MIB is composed of a rich, environmentally friendly and safe magnesium anode, a Chevrel phase cathode and a Mg(AlCl2BuEt)2-based electrolyte, which was first proposed by Aurbach et al. in 2000.89 Currently, the investigated cathodes are principally Chevrel phases, polyanions and chalcogenides. Most cathodes only exhibit low rate capabilities and limited cycle life due to poor conductivity, poor structural stability, and slow kinetics. Yang et al. developed a novel Mg2+-based dual-ion battery (MgDIB) using EG as the cathode, Ti-doped niobium pentoxide nanoflakes (Ti–Nb2O5 NFs) as the anode, and Pyr14TFSI containing 0.5 M Mg(TFSI)2 with additives as these electrolyte (Fig. 7a).90 Benefiting from the fast kinetics of both the EG cathode and the Ti–Nb2O5 NF anode, the MgDIB delivered a high reversible capacity of 93 mA h g−1 at 1C and good rate capability with 77% capacity retention at 5C. Furthermore, the capacity retention at 3C remained at 79% after 500 cycles. Moreover, the MgDIB delivered a high discharge medium voltage of approximately 1.83 V and a high energy density of 174 W h kg−1 at 183 W kg−1 (Fig. 7b).

5.2. ZIBs
Zn is a low-cost, abundant metal with an adequate redox potential (0.76 V vs. SHE), allowing for a rather wide voltage window in water-electrolytes.91 A water-containing Zn2+ battery is composed of a Zn foil anode, a cathode and a mild electrolyte (such as 2 M ZnSO4), which is highly safe and environmentally friendly.92 Zn is considered a promising anode material for next-generation batteries due to its large capacity (5800 mA h cm−3), high water/moisture safety and low cost, all of which have contributed to Zn batteries’ success.93–97 Combining zinc with the graphite cathode takes enormous potential in constructing Zn//EG batteries for stationary applications due to their abundant natural resources, sustainability and cost-efficiency. Ji et al. developed a Zn-based non-aqueous dual-ion battery (ZDIB) by employing an EG cathode, a Zn foil anode, and an ionic liquid electrolyte (Fig. 7c).98 The assembled ZDIB exhibited a reversible discharge capacity of 57 mA h g−1 and a capacity retention of 86% after 500 cycles. Additionally, they constructed a non-aqueous battery with a dual-carbon configuration (ZDCB), which exhibited a reversible discharge capacity of 58 mA h g−1 and a capacity retention of 88% after 500 cycles (Fig. 7d).
5.3. CIBs
As the third most abundant metallic element (3.63%) in the Earth's crust, calcium is a considerably promising alternative to lithium because of its stable valence states, small ionic size (1.00 Å) and low redox potentials (−2.89 V vs. SHE).99 Compared with Mg and Zn, Ca has a lower potential (2.868 V) and lower polarization characteristics, emphasizing its substantial potential.41 Wu et al developed a high-performance Ca2+ full battery with a novel dual-carbon configuration design that uses cost-efficienct and green mesocarbon microbeads as the anode and EG as the cathode (Fig. 7e).100 This Ca2+-based dual-carbon battery (CaDCB) can function in a conventional carbonate electrolyte dissolving Ca(PF6)2, with a reversible discharge performance of 66 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 2C and a high working voltage of 4.6 V. Furthermore, the CaDCB exhibited good cycling performance with a discharge performance of 62 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles and a high capacity retention of 94% (Fig. 7f).
5.4. AIBs
Aluminum, the most abundant metallic element in the Earth's crust (8.13%), is a promising anode material due to its cost-effectiveness, good safety against water/moisture resistance, comparatively low redox potential at 1.66 V (vs. SHE), and high volumetric capacity up to 8035 mA h cm−3. Although rechargeable AIBs have been investigated over for more than three decades, challenges such as poor cycling performance, rapid capacity decay and low battery voltage have remained unsolved.101–103 However, the large size of solvated Al3+ in electrolytes and their strong bonding force with host materials severely impede AIB development. Li et al. reported that EG and Al were used as the cathode and anode, respectively, in room-temperature ionic liquid AlCl3/1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([EMIm]Cl) electrolyte to develop Al–C batteries.104 The contribution of pseudocapacitance at 0.8 mV s−1 was 35.6%, 19.0% and 14.9% at 20 °C, 40 °C and 60 °C, respectively. Due to the increase in diffusion/transmit rates of ions/electrons, and the negligible corrosion effect of electrolytes on Al metal, the Al–C batteries demonstrated good electrochemical characteristics (discharge capacity of 74.4 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 500 mA g−1) at 40 °C. Dong et al. used a commercial EG cathode and AlCl3–triethylamine hydrochloride (AlCl3–ET) electrolyte to fabricate an AIB.105 The fabricated AIB delivered a cathode capacity of 78.3 ± 4.1 mA h g−1 (156.6 ± 8.2 mA h cm−3) at 5 A g−1 with 77.5% retention after 30000 cycles. Additionally, the EG cathode exhibited 101 mA h g−1 (207 mA h cm−3) at 1 A g−1 with 95.5% retention after 11500 stable cycles, even at a high active material loading of 6.16 mg cm−2. Moreover, they provided a good knowledge of its battery mechanism, which included both AlCl4− intercalation and deposition. Different commercially available carbons such as pyrolytic graphite, EG, synthetic graphitic flakes (SGF) and two different carbon papers (H23C3 and H23I1) were assessed as cathodes in AlBs.106 SGF exhibited a good specific capacity (85 mA h g−1), rate performance and cycling stability (>1600 cycles) due to the fast diffusion of the AlCl4− through its structure. Additionally, high-mass loading cathodes (SGF-HML) exhibited excellent areal capacity (5.6 mA h cm−2). Gou et al. developed a low-cost EG as a typical cathode material for high-performance AIBs in pouch cells (Fig. 7g).107 The as-prepared EG cathode can exhibit an excellent capacity of 111 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1. It can also offer an excellent rate capability and a high reversible capacity of 61.1 mA h g−1, which was obtained after 10000 cycles at a high rate of 50 A g−1 (Fig. 7h). Moreover, a high energy density of 64 W h kg−1 was obtained using the entire pouch cell. The high-rate characteristics were the result of rapid electrochemical dynamics caused by the improved pseudocapacitance effect, as analyzed by using CV. The reversible intercalation (1.5–2.4 V) and adsorption (0.5–1.5 V) mechanisms were verified by CV, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and symmetric supercapacitance.
EG-based materials are rarely used in multivalent metal ion batteries, and basically use a single EG as its cathode. At the same time, the energy storage mechanism of EG in multivalent metal ion batteries is also unclear. Therefore, in the follow-up research, it is necessary not only to further expand the application of EG-based composite materials in multivalent metal ion batteries, but also to solve the energy storage mechanism of multivalent metal ions.
6. Summary and outlook
Electrochemical energy storage devices other than Li+ are rapidly progressing towards large-scale energy storage. The electrode material, as a crucial component of the battery, has a significant impact on the electrochemical performance of the battery. The EG-based electrode material has a rich layered structure and adjustable interlayer spacing, which is conducive for the insertion and extraction of metal ions, providing substantial possibilities for the development and design of new battery electrode materials. This study focuses on the latest developments in the use of EG-based materials for rechargeable batteries, including alkaline ion (such as Na+ and K+) storage (Tables 1 and 2) and multivalent ion (such as Mg2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, and Al3+) storage (Table 3) batteries by presenting a brief overview of EG, the preparation strategy of EG-based composites and the recent research progress of EG-based materials in energy storage applications. Despite recent substantial progress, there are still many challenges to overcome. We believe that the application of EG and EG-based materials in the field of electrochemical energy storage necessitates further research in several key areas.

1. Despite the development of various EG synthesis methods, there is still a shortage of cost-effective, green mass production methods with adjustable interlayer spacing; hence, most EG synthesis methods have been postponed. Currently, problems with EG preparation include complicated operations, time-consuming processes, high cost and low yield. The issues of mass manufacturing and low-cost production of high-quality EG materials must be addressed to realize the practical application of EG-based materials in devices other than Li+ electrochemical energy storage devices. The green preparation of EG by an electrochemical method provides a way to solve this problem.
2. The composite structure of EG-based materials can be designed to shorten the ion transmission path, increase the active sites and reduce the volume expansion during the electrochemical reaction. However, existing synthesis approaches are complicated, and processing steps such as hydrothermal/heat treatment are expensive, making them unsuitable for large-scale commercial production and requiring further simplification and optimization. The electrochemical method is used to add additives to the electrolyte in a one-step method to prepare EG-based composites, thereby solving the current problems.
3. Although vigorous efforts for the development of EG-based materials in the field of electrochemical energy storage are made, the ion dynamics and charge storage behavior of EG-based materials in various electrochemical energy storage devices (especially K+/Zn2+/Al3+ ion batteries) are not fully understood. A better understanding of the reaction mechanism is essential for the design and optimization of EG-based electrodes, which provide valuable information. This can be accomplished using several advanced in situ and ex situ characterization and analysis techniques, including transmission electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and simultaneous investigations (such as XRD, X-ray absorption near-edge spectrum and soft X-ray absorption spectrum).
4. The main challenge of MIB, CIB and AIB is the absence of appropriate electrode materials. The high charge density of Mg2+, Zn2+, Ca2+ and Al3+ makes reversible insertion/extraction in the host material difficult. Additionally, the higher desolvation energy consumption in organic electrolytes results in slow reaction kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Despite few EG-based materials being used as electrode materials in MIBs, CIBs, ZIBs and AIBs, the exploration of EG-based materials in these multivalent rechargeable batteries is not extensive, and most of them are still in theory and simple cognition. Furthermore, to increase the energy density of water-based MIBs, CIBs, ZIBs and AIBs, it is appealing to use ultra-concentrated electrolytes to expand the electrochemical stability window of water-based electrolytes.
5. Portable, wearable and flexible electrochemical energy storage devices are the inevitable future direction of electronic product development, and they have attracted widespread interest over the past decade. They require the flexibility of electrode materials, excellent volume and area energy density, light weight and miniaturization. However, a conductive agent and binder not only weaken the energy density of the battery but also weaken the adhesion between the electrode material and the substrate, resulting in shorter battery life. Therefore, the development of a freestanding flexible electrode and a green and stabilized solid electrolyte is critical.
Although the abovementioned challenges are currently insurmountable, the contribution of EG-based materials to the development of non-Li-based electrochemical storage devices cannot be ignored. Furthermore, reasonable use of the performance of EG-based materials will encourage the development of non-Li-based electrochemical energy storage devices in addition to electrochemical energy storage requirements. It is expected that EG-based materials will be crucial in the commercialization of advanced non-Li-based electrochemical energy storage devices in the future due to the continuous in-depth exploration of this field, whether it is general scenarios or specific needs.
