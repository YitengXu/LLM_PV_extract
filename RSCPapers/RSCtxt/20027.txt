    , Accepted 14th September 2021First published on 14th September 2021AbstractOwing to its unique ability to efficiently convert low-energy photons into high-energy photons, triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) based photon upconversion is a promising strategy for harvesting the low-energy tail of the solar spectrum for photovoltaic technologies. However, breaking through the upconversion quantum efficiency is not easy due to the few examples of existing annihilators that maximize the efficiency of singlet generation by TTA. Here, we present a new bichromophoric annihilator (PCP) that is paired with a metallic porphyrin as a sensitizer in low viscosity solution, and the system shows a record red-to-green external upconversion yield of 42%. This value can be achieved thanks to the photophysical properties of PCP that allow achieving a unitary triplet-to-singlet conversion efficiency and to its structural features that enable high fluorescence yields even at high concentrations.
Introduction
Photon upconversion (UC), converting the low energy light into higher energy light, is an important method for surmounting the efficiency limits of sunlight-powered devices.1 Many efforts have been devoted to developing techniques and new materials for photon upconversion, because of its extensive applications in diverse fields such as photocatalysis, photodynamic therapy, optogenetics, bioimaging and anti-counterfeiting.2–6 Nevertheless, conventional mechanisms, such as multistep excitation of lanthanides ions,7 two-photon absorption,8 and second harmonic generation,9 require too high excitation intensities to work efficiently with respect to the solar irradiance, or even the use of coherent radiation. Therefore, sensitized photon upconversion based on triplet–triplet annihilation (sTTA-UC) has been attracting continuous attention due to its unique advantage of non-coherent light conversion efficiency at low powers.10–12 This phenomenon was firstly unveiled by Parker and Hatchard over 60 years ago,13 with the advancement of heavy metal–organic complexes (sensitizers, energy donors) with long lived triplet states, and this field has rapidly developed in the 21st century.14–16 However, the overall efficiency of sTTA-UC is still a challenge because of the shortage of highly efficient annihilators.
The sTTA-UC process typically involves two main functional components: an energy harvester/triplet sensitizer and a triplet annihilator/emitter (Fig. S1, ESI†).17–19 The sensitizer absorbs low-energy photons and transfers the harvested energy to the annihilator through non-radiative energy transfer (ET). Subsequently, two annihilators in their triplet state can encounter yielding one singlet ground state and an excited singlet state with energy larger than that of the absorbed photons. An anti-Stokes emission is then generated by radiative recombination of the annihilator excited singlet. For optimized sensitizer/annihilator pairs, excellent upconversion output quantum yield QYout, which is defined as the ratio between the number of the emitted photons and the number of the absorbed ones, larger than 0.2 has been obtained at low excitation intensities comparable to the solar irradiance. These encouraging results have been achieved due to the huge efforts spent in the past decades to develop efficient light harvesters/sensitizers, which range from transition-metal complexes to metallic porphyrins and surface engineered semiconductor nanocrystals.20–22 In particular, metallic porphyrins show excellent performances as sensitizers thanks to their conjugated porphyrinic ring that enables good absorption, to ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) that allows populating efficiently their metastable triplets from which the energy is transferred to the annihilator triplets, and to their electronic structure that results in a good transparency window in the upconverted light spectrum. Nevertheless, the application of sTTA-UC is still deficient because of the tough and challenging synthesis and unpredictable photophysical properties of efficient annihilators. Recently, Kimizuka and Yanai et al. discovered an excellent UV emitter, 1,4-bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl)naphthalene (TIPS-Nph), reporting the highest visible-to-UV sTTA-UC efficiency of 0.10 (theoretical maximum of QYout is 0.5).23 In addition, some researchers have designed a series of tetracene dimers, 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA) based oligomers and dendrimers as annihilators, suggesting the possibility of exploiting upconversion through intramolecular TTA.24,25 However, due to the structural planarity and rigidity of these annihilators, the process yield was only slightly improved (Table S1, ESI†). Therefore, to achieve highly efficient photon upconversion, a new pathway of annihilator design and synthesis is still in urgent need.
In this work, we design and synthesize a fluorescent bichromophoric perylene derivative (PCP) to be used as a triplet annihilator. The spacing obtained between the perylene units is large enough to avoid their interaction which affects their electronic properties, and this result is pivotal for sTTA-UC, especially when considering compact arrangements. By coupling with a suitable metallic-porphyrin type sensitizer (PtTPBP) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution, we observe that the sTTA-UC statistic limit is bypassed, obtaining an excellent red-to-green QYout of 42%. This result indicates that the electronic properties of PCP allow maximizing the production of upconverted singlets by TTA. Moreover, the investigation of the fluorescence and upconversion photophysics suggests that the molecular structure and high solubility limit the π–π stacking of perylene units, and consequently the detrimental formation of aggregates, which ultimately lead to the high upconversion efficiency recorded.
Results and discussion
Molecular design, synthesis, and photoluminescence properties
It is well-known that perylene is an excellent annihilator in sTTA-UC due to its optimal emission efficiency (0.95) and quite high T2 state compared with the T1 state. The highest external upconversion yield reported so far is 0.38 when perylene was sensitized by palladium(II)tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPBP).26 However, due to the structural planarity, perylene suffers from fluorescence quenching and excimer formation at high concentrations.27 Since then, some perylene-derivative annihilators have been investigated, such as the addition of alkyl, carbonitrile, or acetenyl groups.28–30 Among these systems, the highest TTA upconversion efficiency achieved was 0.17, lower than that of perylene/PdTPBP in THF.
Herein, we design an annihilator, 4,12-diperylene[2.2]paracyclophane (PCP), with two twisted perylene chromophores in spatial orientation, exhibiting a higher upconversion efficiency. PCP was synthesized directly from the corresponding 4,12-dibromo[2.2]paracyclophane and 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-(3-perylenyl)-1,3,2-dioxaborolane by palladium-catalysed coupling reactions.31 The synthesis details are reported in the Experimental section. Fig. 1 shows the PCP molecular structure and its main photophysical properties in comparison with the reference perylene in THF diluted solution. The chemical structure of PCP was well identified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 1a, the molecular design includes a flexible spacer between two perylene chromophores that should limit the π–π stacking of perylenes thanks to the dye twisted structure, especially at high concentrations. Using DFT calculation on optimized geometry we estimated the average distance between the perylene branches to be 9.2 Å (Fig. S2, ESI†), large enough to avoid detrimental intermolecular interactions that could affect the perylene electron properties, but short enough to promote future applications in solid-state upconverters, where the excitation energy can diffuse by intermolecular hopping. The PCP first allowed electronic transition S0 → S1*, which lies in the visible spectral range, with a maximum absorption peak at 445 nm (Fig. 1b). The molar extinction coefficient ε at the maximum is 6 × 104 M−1 cm−1, which is about 20 times larger than that of perylene. The absorption profile shows a series of vibronic replicas at 418 nm and 395 nm, due to the coupling with the C–H vibrational modes (∼160–180 meV) that are mirrored in the photoluminescence spectrum peaked at 465 nm in a diluted solution.32 The emission Stokes shift from the absorption is 110 meV, which suggests a quite rigid structure with a limited rearrangement with respect to the excited state. The PL quantum yield (Φfl) of PCP in the diluted solution is ∼1.

All geometries were optimized using Gaussian 09 with DFT at the PBE1PBE/6-311g* level. (b) Molar extinction coefficient (dashed lines) and photoluminescence spectra of perylene (top) and PCP (bottom) in THF diluted solution (10−7 M). The inset shows the time resolved photoluminescence spectra recorded at the emission maximum under pulsed laser excitation at 405 nm. The solid lines are the fit of data with a single exponential decay function with a characteristic lifetime τfl. 
The insets of Fig. 1b show the time resolved photoluminescence spectra of the two molecules recorded at the emission maximum under pulsed excitation. The PCP emission intensity decays with time as a single exponential function with a characteristic decay rate kfl = 285 MHz, which corresponds to a fluorescence lifetime of τfl = 3.5 ns, i.e. shorter than the 4.8 ns of perylene. The slight redshift of PCP electronic energies and its excellent emission properties suggest further similarities with perylene. A qualitative computational analysis of the PCP system supports this picture. Fig. 1a shows the electronic probability density of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO, ground state S0, singlet character) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, lowest excited state T1, triplet character) calculated by using a DFT approach (experimental).33 The modelling shows that both the HOMO and LUMO hybrid orbitals are mainly condensed on the perylene-like branch of PCP, with a limited delocalization of the electronic cloud on the phenyl ring. This agrees with the fact that PCP possesses energies and emission properties strictly like those of perylene, and hints that also the triplet energies can be similar. The estimated T2 energy is larger than two times T1 for both perylene and PCP (Table S2, ESI†). Despite this is a strictly qualitative comparison, since calculated triplet energies can vary significantly according to the imposed constraints,34 this finding suggests that PCP can also be an excellent annihilator.
Before testing its performance as an upconverter, we monitored the PCP emission yield as a function of concentration. A quite large annihilator concentration is required to maximize the ET efficiency in sTTA-UC systems. Previous studies demonstrated that the QYout can be limited because of partial reabsorption of the upconverted light generated from emitters with a fluorescence yield Φfl lower than 1. Moreover, in the specific case of perylene additional efficiency losses must be considered because of the appearance of aggregated species at high concentrations that introduce competitive energy dissipation channels. Fig. 2a shows the experimental Φfl as a function of the PCP concentration from 10−7 M to 5 × 10−3 M in THF solution (experimental).
 Fig. 2  (a) PCP (dots) and perylene (triangles) photoluminescence quantum yield Φfl as a function of the dye concentration in THF and cyclohexane solution, respectively. The inset shows the photoluminescence spectra of the PCP solution series under CW excitation at 380 nm. (b) Fluorescence decay rate kfl observed at 460 nm under pulsed laser excitation at 340 nm for the considered solution series. 
The data show that the Φfl value is almost unaffected until the concentration of 10−4 M is surpassed. Above this value the emission yield starts to decrease, reaching 0.70 at the maximum concentration employed. Notably, the emission yield reduction at high concentrations is less pronounced compared to perylene over the same concentration range. We investigated the sample series by steady state and time resolved experiments to point out the origin of this efficiency loss. No change in the emission profile can be detected until the high 10−3 M concentration is employed (Fig. 2a inset), while for perylene the emission spectrum starts to be affected at a concentration of 10−4 M (Fig. S3, ESI†). This effect can be ascribed to a less effective reabsorption of the emission due to the larger Stokes shift of PCP. No substantial changes are observed in the recombination rate of excited PCP molecules kfl, which remains well assessed at around 300 MHz (Fig. 2b and Fig. S4, ESI†). This result suggests a very limited efficiency for the formation of excimeric species30 that could quench the PCP emission.35,36 Excimers are formed as evanescent collisional complexes between excited and ground state molecules, and thus their formation probability is usually enhanced by increasing the dye density.37 This effect is known for perylene, which tends to form dark excimers that cannot be probed with photoluminescence spectroscopy techniques, which quench the dye fluorescence.35,36 On the other side, we cannot exclude a priori the spontaneous or photoinduced formation of stable PCP aggregates,37 which can partially reabsorb the PCP fluorescence by lowering the global yield without affecting the emission recombination kinetics. Although the existence of both excimers and stable aggregates should be still verified, the absence of fluorescence quenching strongly supports the conclusion that the peculiar PCP structure affords a reduced aggregate formation yield with respect to monomeric unsubstituted perylene,27 thus enabling the use of high dye concentrations without critical energy losses.
Photon upconversion based on triplet–triplet annihilation
In sTTA-UC, the maximum QYout achievable is 0.5 owing to the thermodynamic limit of 2Ein ≥ Eout, i.e. a minimum of two low-energy (Ein) photons are required to generate one photon with higher energy (Eout), even in the case of a 100% efficient TTA-UC mechanism according to the recently discussed convention.38 Specifically, the thermodynamic limit can be reached only if each TTA event leads to the production of an emissive singlet. Unfortunately, the intrinsic probability to generate emitting states is set by an additional statistic requirement, which, in general, further decreases the achievable maximum yield. The QYout value can indeed be calculated as the product of the efficiencies of all the involved photophysical steps according to eqn (1): QY = 0.5fΦISCΦETΦTTAΦfl(1)where the pre-factor 0.5 marks the thermodynamic limit. The other parameters are the efficiencies of the sensitizer ISC (ΦISC), of the energy transfer (ΦET), of the TTA (ΦTTA) and of the emitter fluorescence (Φfl). The parameter f represents the probability of obtaining a singlet excited state upon TTA, which depends on the annihilator electronic properties. Indeed, the TTA is a two-particle collision process, which results in the generation of excitons with different spin character according to the statistical combination of the colliding species spin. The probability of production of quintet states is negligible, because they require the simultaneous excitation of two electrons and are usually energetically unattainable. In contrast, if E(T2) ≤ 2E(T1) + kBT and E(S1) ≤ 2E(T1) + kBT, the intermediate collision complex can generate either a singlet excited state S1 or one of the three degenerate high-energy T2 triplet states with a statistical ratio of 1:3, resulting in f ∼ 0.4–0.5 that strongly reduces the QYout. Only the condition E(T2) ≫ 2E(T1) + kBT prevents the formation of both a quintet and high-energy triplets. In this case, a singlet exciton is the only possible TTA outcome, with f = 1. The latter condition is the fundamental requirement to maximize QYout. According to these considerations and studies in the literature, perylene is the ideal annihilator emitter for sTTA-UC because its Φfl is ∼1 in diluted solution, and the T1 → S0 transition is strictly forbidden implying a T1 natural lifetime in the range of 5 ms, and, importantly, E(T2) is sufficiently larger than twice E(T1) = 1.5 eV enabling f = 1.39–43
The ability of PCP as an annihilator/emitter for the TTA-UC process has been tested using platinum(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PtTPBP) as a triplet sensitizer. This phosphorescent system, thanks to the presence of the central metal ion in its molecular structure, affords a ΦISC = 1 and a bright phosphorescence at 785 nm, in resonance with the perylene triplet at 820 nm (Fig. 3a).44 Moreover, the PCP photoluminescence ranging from 450 nm to 600 nm falls in the transparency window of PtTPBP delimited by the B- and the Q-absorption bands peaked at 430 nm and 613 nm, thus limiting the reabsorption of upconverted photons and back-energy transfer from upconverted singlets (Fig. S5, ESI†). We investigated the system upconversion properties of a PtTPBP (10−5 M) and PCP (5 × 10−4 M) solution in THF. The sample absorption is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Under CW excitation at 635 nm the solution exhibits a bright green upconverted emission, matching the PCP fluorescence (Fig. 3b). No PCP emission can be detected without sensitizers in solution demonstrating the occurrence of the sTTA-UC mechanism (Fig. S7, ESI†). The sensitizer shows a phosphorescence yield of 0.22 with a characteristic lifetime of 22 μs (Fig. 3c), i.e. a quite long time that guarantees efficient energy transfer towards the PCP triplets. By comparing the integrated phosphorescence intensity without (I0ph) and with (Iph) PCP, shown in the inset, we estimated an excellent energy transfer yield ΦET = 1 − Iph/I0ph = 0.98, which is confirmed by time resolved experiments that show how the sensitizer emission is effectively quenched in the presence of PCP molecules (Fig. 3c). Considering that a similar efficiency was observed for perylene at the same concentration (Fig. S8, ESI†), we speculate that the PCP triplet energy does not change significantly from the reference system. The occurrence of sTTA-UC is further demonstrated by time resolved experiments. According to the power-dependent behaviour of the TTA kinetics, the intensities of the bright upconverted emission increases with the excitation intensity Iexc. Fig. 3d shows the decay in time of the upconverted emission intensity Iuc at 460 nm as a function of Iexc. At any employed excitation intensity, the decay kinetics are significantly slower than the prompt PCP fluorescence, confirming the involvement of low energy and long living triplet states in the generation of the emissive single states. At the lowest Iexc of 0.1 W cm−2, the signal decays as a single exponential function with a characteristic lifetime τuc = 0.225 ms. Under these conditions, we can calculate the PCP triplet lifetime as τT = 2τuc = 0.45 ms, which allows us to carefully analyse the upconverted emission decay kinetics at higher excitation intensities, which obeys eqn (2): (2)where kA = [τT]−1 = 2.2 kHz. The solid lines in Fig. 3d are the fit of the data according to eqn (2). Considering the measured value of kA, the only free parameter used in the fitting procedure is the TTA yield ΦTTA, which grows from 0 to 0.96 at the highest Iexc of 50 W cm−2. This result agrees with the intrinsic bimolecular nature of the TTA process, which gives dependency of the TTA rate kTTA and yield on the density of triplets available for annihilation that is ultimately set by the excitation light intensity.

(c) Phosphorescence intensity decay recorded at 795 nm in a THF solution of PtTPBP (10−5 M) without (orange) and with (red) PCP (5 × 10−4 M) under pulsed excitation at 635 nm. (d) Upconverted fluorescence intensity decay under modulated excitation at 635 nm as a function of Iexc. Solid lines are the fit of the experimental data with eqn (2). At the lowest excitation intensity, the TTA yield ΦTTA = 0 and the upconverted fluorescence decays as a single exponential function with a characteristic lifetime τuc = 0.225 ms. By following the increment of Iexc, the fits gave a ΦTTA of 0, 0.55, 0.72, 0.80, 0.90 and 0.96, respectively. 
We also investigated the upconversion QYout as a function of Iexc at 635 nm (Fig. 4a). As expected, the sTTA-UC efficiency plateaus to a constant value at high excitation powers, because in this regime the TTA process becomes the most efficient recombination channel for emitter triplets (kTTA ≫ kA), and thus the TTA yield is equal to unity and QYout is maximum, according to the time resolved analysis discussed above. Conversely, at low powers the TTA is negligible (kTTA ≪ kA) and QYout depends linearly on Iexc.45,46 The system is also characterized by a threshold excitation intensity, defined as the intensity at which we observe half of the maximum achievable conversion yield.40 In this case the threshold is 1.3 W cm−2, in agreement with the theoretical value calculated from parameters characteristic of the solution determined experimentally. This value is larger than the ones usually observed for solution-based upconverters, because of the low absorption at the excitation wavelength and the relatively short lifetime of the annihilating triplets (Table S3, ESI†). The maximum QYout measured is 0.42 ± 0.03 under 20 W cm−2, which is, to our knowledge, the highest performance observed for sTTA-UC to date (Fig. 4a and Fig. S9, ESI†). The recorded efficiency agrees with the expected value of 0.41 ± 0.02, which has been calculated using eqn (1) with parameters measured independently (Table S4, ESI†). Notably, this efficiency implies a statistical factor f = 1, which means that not only the quintet states but also T2 are inaccessible to PCP through TTA. This result confirms that the PCP dye preserves the electronic properties of perylene, which are crucial to enhance QYout by maximizing the triplet-to-singlet conversion yield. By decreasing the PCP concentration to 10−4 M, the gain in Φfl is balanced by the corresponding loss of ΦET, resulting in a QYout of 0.37 ± 0.03. By further decreasing the PCP concentration below 10−4 M or by increasing it to values larger than 10−3 M, we observe in both cases a marked QYout loss, even worse than the expected variation predicted by eqn (1) (Fig. 4b). We ascribe this discrepancy to the involvement of back-energy transfer from PCP triplets to sensitizers at low concentrations (Fig. S10, ESI†),47 while further studies are required to understand the behaviour at very high concentrations.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we successfully designed and synthesized a new annihilator chromophore that achieves a high external quantum efficiency of 42% for photon upconversion based on sensitized TTA, close to the theoretical upper limit of 50%. The results obtained indicate that for the PCP dye the generation of emissive singlets by TTA is maximized, and the output light intensity is limited by the emitter fluorescence efficiency or by the sensitizer-to-emitter energy transfer yield. Despite being obtained in a model solution system, our findings suggest that a derivation from known molecular systems with excellent upconversion properties can be considered as an affordable strategy to develop new chromophores suitable for realizing efficient annihilators, especially for Vis-to-UV or NIR-to-Vis upconverters. The breaking of the statistical limit for the TTA step in these spectral ranges48 would significantly push forward the application of the sTTA-UC mechanism, since this achievement will double the efficiency of sTTA-UC devices, such as solar cells and OLEDs,49,50 which already show technological appealing performances. It is worth highlighting that the peculiar molecular bichromophoric structure of PCP seems to be helpful in limiting the occurrence of aggregation phenomena that usually afflict conjugate systems, a feature that could be relevant especially in the development of solid-state upconverters.
Experimental
General methods

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Fourier 400 (400 MHz) spectrometer. High-resolution mass spectral data were obtained by using a SolariX MALDI-P-100-3000 instrument. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary Varian 50 spectrometer. The dye molar extinction coefficient was determined from optical absorption measurements using the Lambert–Beer law. Steady-state PL spectra were recorded with a nitrogen cooled charge coupled device (Spex ≈ 2000) coupled to a polychromator Triax 190 from J-Horiba. A Xe lamp coupled to a Gemini doubled monochromator was employed to have monochromatic excitation light at 370 nm. Upconversion spectra were recorded using a 635 nm solid-state laser diode from Roithner Lasertechnik as an excitation source. The excitation light was removed by using line filters, while for detection the laser stray light was attenuated with a notch filter. The 1/e2 excitation beam diameter was measured by the knife blade method. The laser intensity was varied using reflective power density neutral filters and measured with an optical power meter (Thorlabs PM100USB, power sensor S120VC). All spectra were corrected for the instrumental optical response. The fluorescence and upconversion photoluminescence quantum yields were measured by relative methods using 9,10-diphenylanthracene, Alexafluor™ 647, methylene blue and the upconverting solution of TTBP/PtTPBP from ref. 46 as a standard (Fig. S9, ESI†).46 The PCP absolute fluorescence quantum yield was also independently verified by using an Edinburgh FLS-980 fluorescence spectrometer with a calibrated integrating sphere for absolute measurements. For time-resolved photoluminescence measurements, the samples were excited at 405 or 532 nm with an EPL solid-state laser from Edinburgh (pulse width 150 ps). For time-resolved upconversion measurements, the samples were excited at 635 nm by modulating the laser intensity with a TTi TG5011 wavefunction generator. The spectra were recorded by a nitrogen cooled photomultiplier (Hamamatsu R5509-73) coupled with a high-speed amplifier (Hamamatsu C5594), a 74 100 Cornerstone 2601/4 (ORIEL) monochromator, and a PCI plug-in multichannel scaler ORTEC 9353 100 ps time digitizer/MCS in the photon counting acquisition mode. Density functional theory (DFT) with the Gaussian 09 Suite was used to optimize the structure and calculate the emission energy, and all geometries were optimized using the PBE1PBE functional and the 6-311G(d) basis set.

 Scheme 1  Synthetic route of the PCP molecule. 
A mixture of 4,12-dibromo[2.2]paracyclophane (0.2 g, 0.54 mmol), 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-(3-perylenyl)-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (0.45 g, 1.24 mmol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (0.05 g, 0.04 mmol) and toluene (10 mL) were placed in a round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. Then 4 mL of sodium carbonate (0.14 g) aqueous solution was added. After degassing the reaction mixture several times by freezing and thawing cycles, the reaction was carried out at 100 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was dissolved in ethyl acetate. Then the reaction mixture was washed with water and the organic layer was separated and dried over Na2SO3. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue obtained was purified by column chromatography on SiO2 (dichloromethane/n-hexane from 1/100 to 1/10 v/v as an eluent). Finally, the yellow powder of PCP was collected.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Molecular structure of perylene and PCP. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO, the singlet S0 ground state) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, the T1 triplet state) of PCP and perylene obtained via DFT calculations. All geometries were optimized using Gaussian 09 with DFT at the PBE1PBE/6-311g* level. (b) Molar extinction coefficient (dashed lines) and photoluminescence spectra of perylene (top) and PCP (bottom) in THF diluted solution (10−7 M). The inset shows the time resolved photoluminescence spectra recorded at the emission maximum under pulsed laser excitation at 405 nm. The solid lines are the fit of data with a single exponential decay function with a characteristic lifetime τfl.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) PCP (dots) and perylene (triangles) photoluminescence quantum yield Φfl as a function of the dye concentration in THF and cyclohexane solution, respectively. The inset shows the photoluminescence spectra of the PCP solution series under CW excitation at 380 nm. (b) Fluorescence decay rate kfl observed at 460 nm under pulsed laser excitation at 340 nm for the considered solution series.

 	Fig. 3  (a) Absorption (dashed line) and phosphorescence (solid line) spectrum of the sensitizers PtTPBP in THF solution. (b) Photoluminescence spectrum of a PCP:PtTPBP (5 × 10−4 M:10−5 M) in THF as a function of the excitation intensity (Iexc) at 635 nm. The inset shows the phosphorescence of PtTPBP with (dashed line) and without (solid line) PCP in degassed THF. (c) Phosphorescence intensity decay recorded at 795 nm in a THF solution of PtTPBP (10−5 M) without (orange) and with (red) PCP (5 × 10−4 M) under pulsed excitation at 635 nm. (d) Upconverted fluorescence intensity decay under modulated excitation at 635 nm as a function of Iexc. Solid lines are the fit of the experimental data with eqn (2). At the lowest excitation intensity, the TTA yield ΦTTA = 0 and the upconverted fluorescence decays as a single exponential function with a characteristic lifetime τuc = 0.225 ms. By following the increment of Iexc, the fits gave a ΦTTA of 0, 0.55, 0.72, 0.80, 0.90 and 0.96, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) sTTA-UC upconversion output quantum yield QYout for a PCP:PtTPBP (5 × 10−4 M:10−5 M) solution in THF as a function of the incident excitation intensity Iexc under CW laser excitation at 635 nm, measured in a quartz cuvette of 0.1 cm optical path. The inset is a digital picture of the sample with Iexc = 10 W cm−2. (b) Comparison of theoretical QYout values (squares) calculated using eqn (1) from independently determined parameters vs. the experimental efficiency values (dots) measured as a function of the PCP concentration with Iexc = 20 W cm−2 excitation intensity.
