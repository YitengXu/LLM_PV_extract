    , Accepted 29th February 2016First published on 1st March 2016AbstractWe theoretically investigate the electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) mechanism to produce NH3 on the Ru catalyst. All possible N–N dissociation steps during the reduction processes were evaluated along with the conventional associative and dissociative pathways. Based on the calculated free energy diagrams, it is revealed that the kinetically facile intermediate dissociative pathways during the NRR require a thermodynamic limiting potential (−0.71 V) similar to the associative pathway (−0.68 V), although the initial dissociative pathway as in the Haber–Bosch process has a substantial kinetic barrier for the N–N bond dissociation. The competitive hydrogen evolution is found to be a major hurdle for achieving a high efficiency for the electrochemical nitrogen reduction. In the low overpotential region, the hydrogen adsorption is thermodynamically more favorable than the protonation of N2, thereby reducing the number of active sites for the N2 activation. A comparison of free energies in the presence of different H-coverages on the Ru further demonstrates that the H-coverage can significantly increase the energy barrier for the first protonation of N2, resulting in a change of the potential determining step and an increase in the overpotentials.
Introduction
Ammonia (NH3) is one of the most highly produced chemicals in the chemical industry, which is mainly used as a fertilizer for nitrogen fixation and a precursor to nitrogenous compounds. Since the Haber–Bosch (HB) process had been developed for the production of ammonia by using nitrogen and hydrogen as reactants, ammonia production has reached 500 millions of tons per year.1 Due to harsh reaction conditions of the Haber–Bosch process (150–300 bar and 500 °C), however, this process accounts for 2% of the world energy consumption.2 Furthermore, the reactant H2 is mainly supplied by the steam-reforming processes of coal and natural gas, resulting in the emission of substantial amounts of CO2, a greenhouse gas. Therefore, an alternative way of producing ammonia with less energy consumption is in urgent need.
An electrochemical approach to produce NH3 from N2 in an aqueous solution under moderate reaction conditions is highly desirable, since it uses protons (H+) as the hydrogen source instead of expensive hydrogen gas and the reaction can be performed using the renewable solar- and wind-power-derived electric energy instead of high temperatures and pressures as in the HB process. To date, however, no sufficiently active catalysts have been developed for such an electrochemical conversion of N2 to NH3.
Kordali and Lambrou employed a Ru cathode to catalyze N2 electrochemically to produce NH3.3 The results indicated that the reaction overpotential is as low as 0.08 V at 90 °C, but the faradaic efficiency for the NH3 product is very low (<1%) largely due to the hydrogen evolution side reactions. In recent years, Lan and Tao investigated the electroreduction of N2 at a Pt cathode/anode using various forms of precursors, e.g., air (or N2) and H2O (or H2).4 The results also showed that although the NH3 synthesis began at low overpotentials analogously to the results of Kordali and Lambrou, most current densities were originated, again, from the evolution of hydrogen (98%) rather than from the evolution of ammonia (2%). More recently, Licht and coworkers reported Fe2O3 dispersed in a hydroxide electrolyte as an efficient N2 reducing electrocatalyst yielding 35% of NH3 from water and air at 200 °C.5
From a theoretical perspective, density functional calculations have been applied to understand the electroreduction of N2 at an atomic level. Skúlason and Nørskov investigated two typical reaction mechanisms of the NRR on various transition metals, i.e., associative and dissociative mechanisms, as well as a competitive hydrogen evolution reaction on various metal surfaces. They concluded that the metals with stronger adsorption toward *N than *H (* indicating an adsorbed species on the catalyst) such as Sc, Y, Ti and Zr are the promising metal surfaces for NH3 synthesis since a significant amount of ammonia is expected to be produced compared with hydrogen.6 Apart from the pure metal catalysts, transition metal nitrides have also been investigated as possible NRR catalysts.7–9 Recently, Montoya and Nørskov established a volcano relation for the NRR, which predicts the required potential to make all reactions steps thermodynamically downhill on the basis of binding energies of *N. Following the associative mechanism, the authors suggested new strategies to design the active and selective N2 reduction catalysts by controlling the binding energies of the reaction intermediates selectively.10 The particular assumption of following the associative mechanism in this study was justified by a high kinetic barrier for the initial N2 dissociation in the dissociative mechanism. We note, however, that there are many other steps where the N–N bond dissociation can occur along the entire reduction reaction in addition to the initial N2 dissociation.
Despite these earlier leading efforts on the experimental and theoretical investigations, details of the NRR mechanism are still unclear. Two representative mechanisms that have been mainly discussed so far include, as briefly mentioned above, the associative and dissociative mechanisms.6 In the associative mechanism, N2 molecules are protonated sequentially without breaking the N–N bond until producing the first NH3 molecule, similar to the reaction mechanism in the N2-fixing enzymes.11–13 In the dissociative mechanism, on the other hand, the N2 molecule dissociates at the very beginning of the reaction and each N radical is protonated to produce NH3 analogously to the Haber–Bosch process.14 Since the N–N bond requires as much as 9.79 eV (945 kJ mol−1) to break, this step usually limits the reaction kinetics and is a bottleneck in the Haber–Bosch process as well.
In this study, we use density functional calculations to assess various NRR pathways in detail on the Ru stepped surface as a model system. Ru was chosen as a model catalyst since it is placed at the top of the theoretical volcano plot for the NRR.10 In addition, the stepped surfaces are capable of breaking the N–N bond more efficiently than the flat surfaces, thus responsible for the NRR activity observed in the experiments.10,15 We considered all possibilities for the N–N bond dissociations during the entire NRR and evaluated the feasibilities of each pathway under ambient reaction conditions. We also investigated how the competitive HER impedes the desired NRR as a function of H-coverage.
Computational method
Total electronic energies were calculated using the Vienna ab initio simulation package16,17 with the RPBE exchange functional18,19 and projector-augmented wave pseudopotentials.20 The plane-wave cutoff energy of 500 eV was set for all calculations. As the B5-type site that consists of an ensemble of five Ru atoms at the step edges of large particles is known as the most active site for the conventional Haber–Bosch ammonia synthesis,21 the Ru stepped surface was modeled with a 3 × 4 × 4 (4 Ru atoms at the stepped sites, see the ESI† for the snapshot of the supercell used) atom containing the surface unit cell10 spaced by more than 15 Å in a perpendicular direction to the stepped sites to avoid an imaginary interaction with periodic images. Atoms in the bottom two layers were fixed to their initial positions, while all the other atoms were fully relaxed until the residual forces become less than 0.05 eV Å−1. All possible adsorption sites were considered, including top site of edge, two-fold bridge site of edge, three-fold hollow site, and four-fold hollow site of B5-type site. The N–N dissociation barriers were calculated in the absence of an electric field by a climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method with eight intermediate images.22 For simplicity, we hereby assume that the presence of the electric field at the solid–electrolyte interface does not significantly affect the dissociative barriers.23
Free energy diagrams were established by using a computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) method, which estimates the chemical potential of a proton and electron pair (μ(H+ + e−)) equivalent to that of a half of gaseous hydrogen (0.5μ(H2)) under standard reaction conditions (pH = 0, 298.15 K, 101325 Pa) with the external potential equals to 0 V (vs. RHE).24 The chemical potential of the proton and electron pair is shifted by −eU when the external potential U is applied. Solvation effects are not included since solvation-induced stabilization of adsorbates in the NRR is within 0.1 eV.10 Correction terms to convert electronic energies to free energies were calculated as in the previous publications and the values are summarized in the ESI.†25,26
Results and discussion
Free energetics of possible reaction intermediates
We first obtained the lowest energy structures of all possible reaction intermediates for the NRR on the Ru stepped surface (Fig. 1) and constructed the corresponding free energy profiles (Fig. 2). The results notably include six consecutive N–N bond dissociation steps, while only the first N–N bond dissociation reaction was considered in previous studies.

The numbers at the bottom of each column correspond to the number of proton–electron pairs transferred to N2. Blue, grey and white atoms indicate N, Ru and H, respectively. Red arrows and numbers indicate dissociation steps for a N–N bond and their dissociation barriers.

The dotted red lines indicate dissociation paths with large activation barriers and hence thermally inaccessible at room temperature, while the solid red lines indicate feasible dissociation paths with low activation barriers. Possible intermediate species as a function of added electron/proton pairs are listed on top of the free energy diagram. 
Among the six dissociation steps during the entire NRR, those with activation barriers less than 0.7 eV are assumed to occur with reasonable turnover rates under ambient conditions.23 It is noticeable that the N–N bond dissociations at the early stage of the reaction (*N2 (2) → 2*N (3), *NNH (4) → *N + *NH (5) and *HNNH (6) → 2*NH (7)) are kinetically difficult to occur due to high activation barriers greater than 1 eV (Fig. 1). Especially, the N–N bond in *N2 is unlikely to break under ambient conditions, indicating that the “early” dissociative mechanism is not primarily responsible for the N2 electroreduction on the Ru stepped surface at room temperature. Interestingly, however, other N–N bond dissociation steps (*N2H2 (8) → *NH2 + *N (9), *NH2NH (10) → *NH2 + *NH (11) and *NH2NH2 (13) → 2*NH3 (14)), which have not been considered previously in the literature, are clearly facile due to small activation barriers. We will discuss the consequence of this aspect in detail in the next section. We also note, perhaps as expected,6 that for strongly *N adsorbing catalysts such as early transition metals (Sc, Ti, V, Y, Zr, Nb), the N–N bond in *N2 easily dissociates to follow the dissociative path.
Reaction pathways involving N–N bond dissociation
Having established a free energy diagram for all reaction intermediates in Fig. 2, we now evaluate different reaction pathways, potential-determining steps (PDS) and the corresponding limiting potentials (UL). The PDS is an elementary electrochemical reaction step with the largest positive free energy change. When the free energy change of PDS turns thermodynamically downhill by applying an external potential, this potential is referred to as the limiting potential (we define it as UL = −ΔGmax/e, where ΔGmax is energetically the most demanding electrochemical step). The less negative limiting potential denotes smaller overpotentials.
Possible reaction pathways, PDS and the UL are summarized in Table 1. In all cases, the protonation of *NH2 to desorb in the form of NH3 is the PDS. The associative mechanism requires −0.68 V of UL and reaction pathways involving kinetically feasible intermediate N–N dissociation steps require −0.71 V of UL. On the other hand, the conventional early dissociative mechanism with the first N–N bond dissociation is much less probable to occur under ambient conditions due to the sluggish kinetics of the N–N dissociation, although the thermodynamics become feasible at UL of −0.71 V.

It is helpful to discuss the most favorable reaction pathways under various potential regions. As Table 1 shows, only the associative mechanism becomes thermodynamically feasible at potentials between −0.68 V and −0.71 V. Therefore, in this potential region (−0.71 V < U < −0.68 V), we expect the associative mechanism to be dominant. On the other hand, at potentials below −0.71 V, other reaction pathways involving the dissociation of *N2H2, *NH2NH, and *NH2NH2 also become thermodynamically feasible. Among these three reaction pathways, we expect the reaction through *N2H (4) → *HNNH (6) → *NH2NH (10) → *NH2 + *NH (11) → 2*NH2 (14) → *NH2 + NH3 (16) → 2NH3 (17) to be the most dominant. In the early stage of the reaction, the protonation of *N2H (4) results in the formation of either *HNNH (6) or *N2H2 (8). As G(*HNNH) is energetically more favorable than G(*N2H2) by 0.21 eV, the intermediate ratio of about 4000:1 in favor of *HNNH compared to *N2H2 is expected. As the further protonation of *HNNH (6) leads to *NH2NH (10), which can be possibly dissociated into *NH + NH2 (11) under the reaction conditions, one can see that the reaction pathway involving the dissociation of *NH2NH (10) is the most favorable process.
Overall, we find that the N–N bond dissociation of various intermediate species, previously ignored, can participate in various places of the reaction under ambient conditions, and indeed can be one of the most favorable reaction pathways. Incidentally, those reaction pathways, which involve facile N–N dissociations, exhibit similar PDS (the desorption of *NH2 as NH3) and UL as with the associative mechanism. Thus, we expect that such dissociative reaction pathways also considerably contribute to the NRR activity with the Ru catalyst comparable to the associative pathway.
It would be informative to compare the active sites for the HB process and the electrochemical NRR on the Ru catalyst. In the HB process, the rate-determining N2 dissociation process occurs at the B5-type site of Ru stepped surface as it offers the most stable sites for the adsorption of the dissociated 2*N species.15 On the other hand, in the electrochemical NRR, the two most energy-intensive steps are the protonation of N2 to form *N2H and the desorption of *NH2 as NH3, where the active binding sites are the top site (for *N2H) and the bridge site (for *NH2) of the Ru step edges, respectively (Fig. 1). Therefore, it is interesting to note that, for the same Ru catalyst that converts N2 to NH3, the electrochemical reduction and thermal activation occur respectively in different binding sites (edge vs. B5-type sites).
Selectivity for the N2 reduction products
Since the equilibrium potentials for NH3, HNNH and NH2NH2 are −0.15, −1.10 and −0.33 V vs. RHE, respectively,27 at low enough applied potentials one can expect to observe products other than NH3 (particularly NH2NH2 with an equilibrium potential of −0.33 V). Experimentally, however, NH3 was the only detected product when the Ru cathode was applied for the NRR.3,27 This is either because the desorption of *HNNH (18) is too difficult or because the formation of *NH2NH2 (13) is unfavorable in the first place. For example, in the case of HNNH (18), the desorption of *HNNH (6) to liberate HNNH (18) from the catalyst surface is energetically uphill by 1.53 eV, insurmountable under ambient conditions. On the other hand, for NH2NH2 (19), the desorption of *NH2NH2 (13) to produce NH2NH2 (19) only requires 0.37 eV, but in this case, the formation of *NH2NH2 (13) is unlikely since there are more favorable lower-energy pathways such as to form *NH + NH3 (15) instead of *NH2NH2 (13).
Unwanted hydrogen evolution reaction
It is important to consider the unwanted hydrogen evolution reaction since most current densities observed in the experiments for the NRR were due to the hydrogen evolution side reaction.3,4 The adsorption of the first hydrogen (*H) at the Ru–Ru bridge active sites is thermodynamically downhill by −0.32 eV (Fig. 3), which corresponds to the H-coverage of 0.25 ML on the Ru stepped surface since there are four bridge active sites in which hydrogen can attach. Additionally, the adsorption of the second (0.5 ML), the third (0.75 ML) and the fourth (1 ML) *H is further downhill by −0.35, −0.24 and −0.27 eV, respectively, while the desorption of *H as H2 is always an uphill process. We expect from this result that the active Ru stepped sites are occupied by a high coverage of *H in the low overpotential region, reducing the number of available active sites for the NRR. Thus, one possible reason for the observed low current densities for the production of NH3 is a stronger binding of *H than *N-species, which results in a high coverage of the surface by *H.
 Fig. 3  Free energy diagram for the HER on the Ru stepped surface. 
Next, to investigate the effects of these H-coverages on the activity of NRR, we plotted the H-coverage-dependent free energy diagram for the NRR following the associative mechanism in Fig. 4. In detail, the binding energies of reaction intermediates such as *N2H, *N2H2, and *NH2 which prefer to bind at the edge sites were affected by 0.13–0.40 eV due to the pre-adsorbed hydrogen. On the other hand, the binding energies of reaction intermediates such as *N and *NH which prefer to bind at the three-fold hollow sites were affected only by 0.05 eV. This difference is due to the different extent of interactions between adsorbates and pre-adsorbed *H on the surface. For adsorbates that bind at the edge sites (*N2H, *N2H2, and *NH2), the pre-adsorbed *H is in the first nearest-neighbor position of the adsorbates affecting the energetics of these species greatly, while for adsorbates that bind at the hollow sites (*N and *NH), the pre-adsorbed *H is in the second nearest-neighbor of the adsorbates and hence the interaction is negligible. This is why the effects of pre-adsorbed *H almost monotonically increase as a function of *H-coverage. This change results in a modification in the PDS from a *NH2 removal step (the last protonation step) to a *N2H adsorption step (the first protonation step) with the corresponding UL more negative (higher overpotentials) as *H-coverage increases. This clearly indicates that the pre-adsorbed *H on the active sites not only reduces the number of available active sites but also can increase the overpotential for the NRR.

Conclusions
In this study, we investigated the energetics of the possible NRR pathways involving N–N bond dissociation steps, which have not been considered previously, and the effects of the unwanted HER on the desired NRR. Our main findings are summarized as follows.
(i) On the Ru catalyst, the reaction pathways involving various N–N dissociation steps yield the NRR activity that is comparable to the associative mechanism with a similar limiting potential, suggesting the importance of considering all possible reaction pathways in addition to the conventional associative and early dissociative mechanisms for correct understanding and prediction.
(ii) A high product selectivity for NH3 observed on the Ru electrode is ascribed to a difficulty either to desorb *HNNH due to a strong adsorption energy or to form *NH2NH2 due to the presence of other lower-energy pathways.
(iii) Hydrogen evolution is shown to negatively affect the desired NRR on the Ru catalyst by reducing the number of active sites on the catalysts due to the favorable adsorption of *H. It is also shown that a partial H-coverage can considerably affect the energy barrier for the first protonation of N2 and the desorption of *NH2, resulting in a change of the potential determining step and an increase in the overpotentials.
