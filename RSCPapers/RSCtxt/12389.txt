    , Accepted 2nd March 2020First published on 2nd March 2020AbstractHalide perovskite materials have been recently recognized to possess potentially strong ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity even though the experimental evidence is very limited. Herein, we report high piezoelectricity of representative inorganic halide CsPbBr3 thin films and their energy harvesting and current-sensing characteristics with an optimization process. This is the very first report of introducing an effective piezoelectric coefficient and energy-harvesting performance for inorganic halide perovskites. A record high piezoelectric coefficient of ∼40.3 pm V−1 was obtained for the optimized CsPbBr3, which was attributed to the extended bonding angles of Pb–Br–Pb and Br–Pb–Pb arising from the applied electric field according to structural simulations. As expected from the high piezoelectricity, the electromechanical energy-harvesting performance was very competitive with excellent values of a ∼16.4 V output voltage and ∼604 nA output current achieved for a large-scale harvester of 5 cm2. Highly strain-sensitive devices were also successfully exemplified to identify specific body-motion from the detected current values in the sensitive inorganic halide patches.

Broader context
Halide perovskite materials may be suitable for future electronic and power applications due to their unique advantages in electrical properties and low-temperature processing. Beyond the great potential in photovoltaic cells, halide materials have been actively studied to search for other suitable applications with veiled characteristics. Piezoelectricity-related applications using halide perovskites are another area with unique potential. However, studies on piezoelectricity of halide perovskites are very limited probably due to the difficulty in fabricating high-quality samples, although the possession of ferroelectricity was theoretically estimated with calculated polarization values in the literature. Here, we report high piezoelectricity of representative inorganic halides, CsPbBr3, which were optimized with a poling process, and their energy harvesting and current-sensing characteristics in the form of thin films. This is the very first report of revealing an effective piezoelectric coefficient for any inorganic halide perovskite and demonstrating piezoelectric energy harvesting performance using inorganic halides. The origin of the high piezoelectricity in inorganic halides is pursued via structural estimation associated with the changes in bonding angles. As expected from the high piezoelectricity, the electromechanical energy-harvesting performance is very competitive compared to any reported values even for hybrid halide thin films.

Introduction
Halide perovskite materials have been extensively investigated to search for other unprecedented applications with unique characteristics beyond the recent success in solar cells that generate a high photovoltaic conversion efficiency due to the high molar absorption coefficient, low exciton binding energy, and long diffusion length.1–4 In addition, they have been widely studied as potential optoelectronic components including photodetectors, laser diodes, and light emitting diodes.5–8 One of the extended applications is related to the use of the ferroelectric or piezoelectric behavior of halide perovskites.9–12 Even though literature reporting such properties of halide perovskite materials is very limited, a recent effort has suggested high potentials with a large polarization value of 63 μC cm−2 specifically for formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) as a result of structural simulation.13 The inorganic halide compound of cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) was also estimated theoretically to have a polarization of 0.45 μC cm−2 by crystal symmetry simulation.14 Further, it was predicted that the polarization could be enlarged to 23 μC cm−2 by lattice distortion under compressive stress.14 The observed potential values of polarization for the halides are presumably due to the ionic off-centering in BX6 cages in the orthorhombic ABX3 perovskite structure and the accompanying dipole rotations under an electric field.15 However, these examples are based on theoretical estimations through structural considerations without strong correlations to experimental evidence. The simulated nonlinear behavior of polarization with electrical field suggests the possession of ferroelectricity in halide materials.15 On the other hand, limited evidence of piezoelectricity has been reported through the demonstration of an effective piezoelectric coefficient d33,eff in the range of 6 to 25 pm V−1 under light for hybrid MAPbI3 thin films as a result of local piezo-responses characterized by piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM).15 Compared to typical piezoelectric oxide materials (like Pb(Zr,Ti)O316,17 or Pb-free oxides17–20), halide perovskites have advantages because they are processable at low temperatures <100 °C (which is suitable for flexible systems without the film transfer process) and possess a low electrical resistivity and a low relative permittivity (which are beneficial for charge collection). There has been no report experimentally dealing with the piezoelectricity of inorganic halide perovskite materials such as representative CsPbBr3 or CsPbI3.
One of the applications using large piezoelectricity may lie in electromechanical energy harvesting, which is determined by the magnitude of the relative polarization and thus the induced surface charges. A lot of studies have recently investigated energy-harvesting characteristics using halide materials. Most work has been based on composites containing halide nanoparticles dispersed in a polymer matrix to provide suitable flexibility for reliable energy-harvesting performance.21–23 For example, a composite consisting of formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr3) nanoparticles in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer showed a high output voltage of 8.5 V and a current density of 3.8 μA cm−2.24 For the composite methyl-ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3)/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), a piezoelectric output voltage of ∼1.8 V and an output current of ∼37.5 nA were reported.25 However, there has been no report on the piezoelectric energy harvesting performance of inorganic halide perovskites such as CsPbBr3 even though some theoretical studies on piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity are available for inorganic halides.11,26,27
Herein, we introduce experimentally proven piezoelectric properties of inorganic halide perovskite CsPbBr3 optimized with the synthesis parameters and an external electric field. The origin of the high piezoelectricity is pursued on the basis of structural analysis focusing on potential unit cell distortions with applied fields. The successful application of the optimized films as energy harvesters and physiological sensors follows. As a highlight, we achieved an excellent output voltage of ∼16.4 V with an output current of ∼604 nA for the 260 nm-thick CsPbBr3 thin films processed by regular spin-coating. The promising values are due to the high effective piezoelectric coefficient d33,eff of ∼40.3 pm V−1, obtained by poling at an optimal electric field. The potentially extended distortions of PbBr6 octahedra and the resultant structural changes were assumed to be responsible for the high piezoelectricity that was induced by the optimal poling process. The effect of poling in inorganic halide thin films has not been reported so far. The performance stability over 3000 bending cycles also indicates that the poling process is critical in maintaining promising harvesting performance. The high electromechanical coupling performance was further verified by designing physiological current-sensing devices to electrically sense the motion of a body with an electrical signal.
Results and discussion
CsPbBr3 thin films were prepared on an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated soda lime silicate (SLS) glass substrate by spin-coating. Fig. 1a shows the effect of precursor concentration on the cross-sectional and surface microstructures of the CsPbBr3 thin films annealed at 70 °C for 5 min. The film thickness and grain size were dependent on the precursor concentration. For example, the film thickness increased from ∼40 to ∼260 nm with increasing precursor concentration from 0.1 M to 0.4 M. The variations in the film thickness and grain size are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The dependence of the precursor concentration on the microstructural evolution is well known in the solution-based deposition of inorganic halides.28 As expected, increasing the concentration of the precursor solution was found to increase the film coverage. Especially, the CsPbBr3 thin film prepared with 0.1 M solution showed imperfect coverage with randomly distributed voids on the surface. The increase of the solution concentration (up to 0.4 M) led to an improved density of the films with enlarged grains and the least voids on the film surface. Practically, the concentration of ∼0.4 M was recognized as the highest one for generating the thickest layer of the halide film with uniform coverage due to the solubility limit of CsBr in solvent.29 The cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images with elemental distributions of Cs, Pb, and Br for the 0.3 M and 0.4 M thin films are available in Fig. S2 (ESI†). They indicate very uniform distributions of the elements for the single-phase perovskite film. Fig. 1b shows high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) patterns of the films processed with different precursor concentrations. All the films showed a well-defined orthorhombic perovskite structure with random orientations.30–32 CsPbBr3 perovskites undergo a cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition at 130 °C and a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic transition at 88 °C.33 The intensities of the (101), (121) and (202) peaks became stronger for higher precursor concentrations, which suggests better crystallinity for thicker films. In addition, Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the effects of the solution concentration (or film thickness) on the optical properties of the thin films on the basis of ultraviolet and visible (UV-vis) absorption and photo-luminescence (PL) characterization. The absorption band edge of the films was found at ∼529 nm in the UV-vis absorption spectra as related to the direct band gap of ∼2.34 eV.34,35 The highest absorbance at 0.4 M indicates the expected direct correlation between the absorbance and film thickness.36,37 The highest PL intensity at 0.4 M was also believed to arise from the larger grain size, which led to reduced light scattering at the grain boundary.38 The transparency of the halide films depended on the film thickness and showed higher values for the solution with a lower concentration (Fig. S3c, ESI†).

(c) HR-XRD patterns and the variations in (d) lattice constants and (e) the b/a ratio for the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 thin films with different poling field from 0 to 24.9 kV cm−1. 
The 0.4 M CsPbBr3 thin films further underwent poling by applying electric fields for the purpose of domain orientation to explore potential enhancements in piezoelectricity and harvesting performance.39Fig. 1c shows the HR-XRD patterns of the 0.4 M CsPbBr3 thin films prepared under different poling fields (0 to 24.9 kV cm−1) for 10 min at room temperature. The values of lattice constants, b/a values, and cell volumes, which were extracted using Bragg's law from the XRD information, are available in Table S1 (ESI†). Fig. 1d shows plots exhibiting the variations in the lattice parameters a, b, and c for the orthorhombic structure with increasing the poling field. Fig. 1e shows the change in the ratio b/a against the poling field. The lattice constants a and c did not change significantly with increasing poling field while the increment in b was evident. The increase in the value of b (along the long axis) suggests the extended displacement of the Pb2+ ion from the central position of the Br6 octahedron.40,41 Following a substantial increase in the b-axis, the b/a values also increased noticeably with increasing poling field, which indicates elongation of the CsPbBr3 structure along the poling direction. The resulting orthorhombic distortion was associated with the maximum b/a value of ∼1.415 for the sample poled at 24.9 kV cm−1. The increased distortion resulted in an increase in the unit cell volume, e.g., from 787.3 Å to 794.5 Å after poling at 24.9 kV cm−1.
Additional information on the degree of cell distortion of the Pb-centered Br6 octahedra was gained by structural simulation using the VESTA (visualization for electronic and structural analysis) program based on the poling-field-dependent lattice parameters. As a result of the estimation using the lattice information, Fig. 2a shows the variations in the Pb–Br–Pb bonding angle in the ac plane and the Pb–Br–Pb and Br–Pb–Pb bonding angles along the b-axis in terms of poling fields. The actual values are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). As expected from the changes in lattice constants, the bonding angles were extended with increasing the poling field, which is associated with dipole rotations and thus domain alignment. Especially, the increases in both the Pb–Br–Pb and Br–Pb–Pb angles along the b-axis suggest that the octahedra were aligned parallel to the field. Simple schematic illustrations of the unit cell alignments that reflect the enlargements of the bonding angles in the ac plane (left) and along the b-axis (right) are presented in Fig. 2b. The extended lattice constant along the long axis suggests increased displacement of the Pb2+ ion from the center of the Br6 octahedron and thus increased magnitude of each induced dipole moment. Furthermore, the octahedron occupying the space between the Cs ions was distorted along the poling direction, which is responsible for the increased net polarization with preferably oriented dipoles. Additional schematic illustrations of the orthorhombic crystal structures from top and side views as an ideal case of the perfect dipole alignments are presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). They show the tilted octahedra around the b-axis, which cause random positioning of each unit cell before the poling field is applied. Because the external electric field induces lattice changes involving the extended bonding angles in the ac-plane and along the b-axis, the crystal structures result in large dipole moments while maintaining the same orthorhombic phase.

The correlation of the lattice extension with piezoelectricity was further verified by piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM). Fig. 2c shows examples of PFM amplitude contrast images with a scan size of 5 μm × 5 μm for the unpoled and 24.9 kV cm−1-poled films processed with the 0.4 M solution. The contrast represents the magnitude of the amplitude: a darker image indicates a lower amplitude. The poled sample with the maximum field demonstrates brighter images across the entire surface, indicating a higher electrical response from the applied field. The electric field causes domain orientations so that the overall brightened section represents a stronger piezoelectric response.42 The distribution of the amplitudes with increasing the poling field is shown in Fig. 2d. It is apparent that increasing the poling field induces higher amplitudes with a broader distribution. The right-shifted amplitude distribution is mainly due to the intensified domain orientations owing to the higher electric field. Additional PFM amplitude images with the change in peak amplitude at each poling field are available in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Fig. 2e demonstrates the dependence of the amplitude on the applied DC bias in the range of ±10 V for the 0.4 M CsPbBr3 samples. Butterfly-type loops of the curves are seen with larger values for the higher poling field-applied samples. The butterfly loops in Fig. 2(e) were highlighted with individual curves in Fig. S6 (ESI†) to reveal more clearly the poling field-dependent ferroelectricity with a distinct coercive field. We did extra experiments to demonstrate the polarization–electric field (P–E) curves of the CsPbBr3 thin films with apparent evidence of the ferroelectric state depending on the poling field as shown in Fig. S7a (ESI†). The plots of remnant polarization Pr and coercive field Ec with the poling field are also available in Fig. S7b (ESI†). As expected, a higher poling field induced a stronger nature of ferroelectricity as reported in the literature for other oxide perovskites.43,44 Particularly, a larger Pr value was obtained for the 24.9 kV cm−1-poled samples while Ec did not change significantly with the poling field, which is similar to the PFM result in Fig. S6 (ESI†). It is worth mentioning that the poling at the lower electric field of 12.4 kV cm−1 showed more clear saturation of polarization, particularly compared to the case of poling at the highest field of 24.9 kV cm−1, which may suggest an electrically leaking state in the case of high field-poling. The effective piezoelectric coefficient d33,eff, which was calculated from the amplitude dependence, increased gradually from ∼7.7 pm V−1 for the unpoled film to ∼40.3 pm V−1 for the 24.9 kV cm−1-poled film as seen in the plot of Fig. S8 (ESI†). The value of ∼40.3 pm V−1 is very meaningful considering the values of 4.2–25 pm V−1 reported for other hybrid halide perovskite thin films.15,24,45–49 The reported d33,eff values for the hybrid halide perovskites FAPbBr3, MAPbI3 and MASnI3 in the forms of thin films and single crystals are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). This is the first report on the d33,eff value for any inorganic halide perovskite including CsPbBr3. The enhanced piezoelectricity with poling is directly related to the structural distortion of Br6 octahedra estimated in Fig. 2a and b. The extended domain orientation accompanied by the lattice extension and cell distortion along the field direction likely contributes to inducing the stronger field-induced strain response in the poled sample as reported in typical perovskite oxide films.50,51
We prepared piezoelectric energy harvesters of the 0.4 M CsPbBr3 thin films passivated with PDMS layers. Details of the experimental procedure for preparing the harvester are provided in the Experimental section. A photograph of the semi-transparent CsPbBr3 energy harvester is shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†) as an example. Fig. 3 shows the piezoelectric energy harvesting characteristics such as the output voltage and output current before the poling for the thin films processed with different solution concentrations. Repetitive bending was applied in the range of applied strain ε of 0.75 to 1.67% for the harvesting measurements. Fig. 3a and b show examples of output voltage and current (measured at a bending frequency of 1 Hz) for a maximum bending strain of 1.67% for varied solution concentrations of 0.1 M to 0.4 M. All plots representing the harvesting performance at different strains and solution concentrations can be seen in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The bending strain applied to the perovskite layer was calculated by ε = t/2r, where t is the film thickness and r is the bending curvature.52 The r value was estimated by the relationship r = L/(2π(ΔL/L − (πt/L)2/12)1/2), where L is the length of the harvester and ΔL is the shortened distance from one end of the sample under bending.53 The calculated bending strain values according to ΔL are available in Table S4 (ESI†). For example, ε increased from 0.75 to 1.67% for ΔL values increasing from 5 to 25 mm for the 30 mm-long (L) sample. The piezoelectric potential V was estimated by the relation of V = gijεEt, where gij is the piezoelectric voltage constant and E is the Young's modulus.54 As expected, the harvesting performance demonstrated the maximum voltage and current values for the higher-concentration-driven films. An output voltage of ∼11.7 V and an output current of ∼147 nA were obtained for the 0.4 M CsPbBr3 film harvester at 1 Hz. The lower values for the thinner film could be due to the clamping effect, wherein a sufficiently thin film is restricted by the influence of the substrate, typically up to ∼200 nm, as has been reported for other common perovskite oxide films.55,56 Similarly, a sufficiently thick film is critical in generating desirable harvesting performance. The ∼260 nm-thick film obtained at 0.4 M is likely thick enough to minimize the clamping effect with the high density of the film. The existence of voids with less coverage seemed to influence the energy harvesting performance negatively by providing shunting pathways between electrodes in the case of low precursor concentration. The optimal bending frequency was obtained from the frequency-dependent output voltage and current curves, as shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), where the two values increased with the frequency up to 1 Hz. To verify the role of the passivating PDMS layer in determining the harvesting performance, we measured the output voltage and current only for the PDMS film, as seen in Fig. S12 (ESI†), obtaining trivial values of ∼0.1 V and ∼7 nA, respectively. In addition, we examined the effect of the grain size on the energy harvesting performance of the CsPbBr3 thin films as seen in Fig. S13–S15 (ESI†). To separate the grain size effect from the film thickness effect, the annealing temperature was varied for 0.4 M films having an identical thickness of ∼260 nm. As a result, the average grain size changed from ∼142 to ∼406 nm for the 25 °C and 70 °C-annealed films, respectively (Fig. S13, ESI†). The output voltage and current values were found to be correlative to the change in grain size. As an example, the increased peak voltage of 11.7 V was obtained for the grain size of ∼406 nm compared to the value of 9.9 V for ∼142 nm. The higher voltage value with the larger grains is likely to be associated with a lower density of non-ferroelectric grain boundaries which can act to impede effective polarization.57,58 The current density–voltage (J–V) behavior of the CsPbBr3 thin films having different grain sizes is also available in Fig. S16 (ESI†). As expected, a larger grain-size sample tended to show a lower leakage current in the applied DC voltage range of −5 to +5 V. For instance, the current level decreased from 5.9 × 10−5 mA cm−2 for the average grain size of ∼142 nm to 2.3 × 10−7 mA cm−2 for ∼406 nm, owing mainly to a lower density of grain boundaries acting as a leakage path.59
 Fig. 3  (a) Output voltage and (b) output current of the CsPbBr3 thin film harvesters processed with different precursor solution concentrations from 0.1 M to 0.4 M, which were measured at a bending frequency of 1 Hz under repetitive bending strains of 1.67%, and the plots of (c) maximum output voltage and (d) maximum output current of the thin film-energy harvesters as functions of variable precursor concentrations and applied bending strain (at 1 Hz). 

Fig. 3c and d clearly demonstrate the strong dependence of the applied strain (or bending curvature) on the maximum output voltage and current of the energy harvesters. The maximum values were found to increase more significantly with the applied strain, particularly at higher concentrations of the solution. For example, the output voltage increased from ∼4.3 V for a strain of 0.75% to ∼11.7 V for 1.67% for the 0.4 M sample, which corresponds to an increment of ∼170% for the output voltage. The film samples processed with low concentrations (<0.2 M) demonstrated a maximum voltage value of <3 V regardless of the range of applied strain. Generally, large current generation is a challenge in improving the output power. The obtained maximum output current of ∼147 nA for the 1.67%-strained 0.4 M sample is significant when compared to the current of ∼61 nA recorded for the 1.67%-strained 0.1 M sample. It is reasonable to suggest that the higher applied strain induced better energy-harvesting performance since a higher strain means a larger applied stress, which is proportional to the degree of generated polarization/electric field.

Fig. 4a and b show representative output voltage and current for energy harvesters made using unpoled and 24.9 kV cm−1-poled thin films. As expected, both the output voltage and current increased dramatically after the poling process. Fig. 4c shows the plots demonstrating variations in the output voltage and output current with the poling field. Significant enhancements were noticeable as a result of increasing the poling field. Maximum values of an output voltage of ∼16.4 V and an output current of ∼604 nA were achieved for the highest poling field of 24.9 kV cm−1, corresponding to improvements of ∼40% and ∼310%, respectively, when compared to results obtained for the unpoled sample. Several studies have demonstrated energy harvesting performance for harvesters based on halide perovskites utilizing various types of materials, e.g., thin films,46,49,60,61 composites with halide nanoparticles,22,24,25,62 and single crystals.47 The performance metrics for the reported harvesters are available in Table S5 (ESI†). The current optimum results of ∼16.4 V and ∼604 nA are very competitive when compared to previously reported results, although it is difficult to directly compare these values because of the non-standardized measurement techniques used. Again, these harvesting values are the very first ones reported for inorganic CsPbBr3-halide-based materials. The obtained value of ∼16.4 V may be the best value so far compared to any halide perovskite-based harvesters, while a higher output current value was reported for the FAPbBr3/PDMS composite harvester poled at 50 kV cm−1.24

A cyclic bending test was conducted because the durability of halide perovskite materials is a critical factor in the utilization of actual energy-harvesting devices. Fig. 4d shows the variations in output voltage up to 3000 bending cycles (at ∼1.67% strain and 1 Hz bending frequency) for the 24.9 kV cm−1-poled thin films processed with different solution concentrations of 0.1 M to 0.4 M. Regardless of the solution concentration, all harvesters demonstrated very stable output voltage values for over 3000 cycles. This achievement implies the robustness and mechanical durability of the energy harvesters in practical use. The results for the cycling tests for the unpoled samples processed with different solution concentrations are available in Fig. S17 (ESI†), which shows quite consistent voltage values of around ∼10 V for each cycle. The maximum difference in the output voltage for the durability test comprising 3000 bending cycles was ∼7% for the poled sample (0.4 M and 24.9 kV cm−1 poling) and ∼22% for the unpoled sample.
The optimized electromechanical device processed with the best conditions was further investigated to determine its suitability and sensitivity in detecting electrical signals specifically from selected regular body motions, such as blinking, finger motions, coughing, and yawning. Fig. 5a schematically illustrates attachment of the CsPbBr3 film devices to the sides of the eyes, the wrist, and the center of the neck with double-sided tape. The operations of blinking, finger movements, coughing, and yawning induced stress on the attached monitoring device and generated electrical signals depending on the individual motion. Fig. 5b shows the results of electrical currents generated by blinking motions detected by the attached CsPbBr3 patch on the side of an eye. Clear electrical signals of ∼0.6 nA were detected depending on the number of instances of blinking. Each signal represents an individual motion of blinking. Blinking multiple times generated continuous peak-signals with progress of the motion. Fig. 5c demonstrates the production of electrical signals owing to motions of folding the finger, as detected with help from the patch attached on the wrist. The magnitude of the electrical signals increased with the number of fingers used in the stress stimulations. For example, the electrical signal increased from ∼1 nA for folding a single finger to ∼2.8 nA for folding five fingers, indicating that a larger stress was converted into a higher electrical signal. The sensing results obtained using the throat-attached patch owing to the coughing and yawning motions are shown in Fig. 5d; different magnitudes of electrical signals were detected for the motions of coughing (∼4.8 nA) and yawning (∼1.9 nA) by the CsPbBr3-based sensing devices. The plot of average peak currents obtained from multiple measurements by five different participants is presented in Fig. S18 (ESI†). The above physiological sensing results indicate that inorganic halide-based electromechanical sensors can be used to identify various body motions resulting in different magnitudes of current signals with high sensitivity.

Conclusions
The representative inorganic halide compound of CsPbBr3 was investigated as an example of utilizing piezoelectricity for electromechanical energy-harvesting and current-sensing applications. This is the very first report of demonstrating the harvesting and sensing performance using inorganic halide perovskite-based thin films. The piezoelectric properties of inorganic halide CsPbBr3 were initially optimized with the processing parameters and a subsequent poling field, which resulted in a high effective piezoelectric coefficient of 40.3 pm V−1. As the structural origin of the high piezoelectricity, the bonding angles of Pb–Br–Pb and Br–Pb–Pb were estimated to be extended along the b-axis and in the ac-plane of the perovskite structure. Excellent electromechanical energy-harvesting performance of a ∼16.4 V output voltage and ∼604 nA output current was obtained for the optimized CsPbBr3 thin films with promising durability up to 3000 bending cycles, which demonstrated only ∼7% degradation in the output voltage. Physiological current-sensing using the flexible thin films was also successful by demonstrating a detectable output current of a few nA as the result of stressing body-motions, such as blinking, finger movements, coughing, and yawning.
Experimental section
Preparation of CsPbBr3 thin films
CsPbBr3 precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving cesium bromide (CsBr, 99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) powders in equimolar amounts in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) under stirring at room temperature for 5 h. The CsPbBr3 precursor solution was spin-coated at different concentrations of 0.1 to 0.4 M only one time on an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated soda lime silicate (SLS) glass substrate at 1000 rpm for 60 s. Prior to deposition, the substrate was cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol in sequence in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min in each and then treated in a UV-ozone atmosphere for 20 min for favorable wetting of the precursor solution via surface modification. The spin-coating process was carried out in a glove box in a controlled atmosphere with <10 ppm O2/H2O. The as-deposited films were annealed at 70 °C for 5 min to remove any residual solvent.
Characterization of the films
Surface and cross-sectional microstructures of the CsPbBr3 thin films were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM 7610F, JEOL, Japan). Optical transmittance and absorption spectra of the films were obtained using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (V-530, JASCO, Japan). Photo-luminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a micro-Raman measurement system (LabRam Aramis, Horiba Jobin Yvon, France) operated at an emission wavelength of 532 nm. The crystal structure was examined using a high-resolution X-ray diffractometer (HR-XRD, SmartLab, Rigaku, Japan) with Cu-Kα radiation in the Bragg–Bretano (θ/2θ) geometry in a 2θ range of 10–50°. The films were further characterized by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM, Nanoscope V Multimode, Bruker, USA) with a Pt/Ir-coated Si cantilever. The piezoelectric response amplitude over the sample surface was measured at a driving voltage of 4 V in the lock-in mode under a variable AC voltage. The structural origins of the observed variations in the piezoelectric response under different electric fields were simulated using the commercial VESTA program, which were correlated with changes in the atomic bonding distances and angles. The current density–voltage (J–V) behavior was measured using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (4200A-SCS, Tektronix, USA) with a maximum applied voltage of 5 V. The top Au electrodes (100 nm-thick) were deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask.
Assembly of the piezoelectric energy harvester
Flexible piezoelectric energy harvesters with an active area of ∼5 cm2 were fabricated by spin-coating the 0.4 M CsPbBr3 precursor solution on an ITO-coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate (∼175 μm in thickness) under identical deposition/annealing conditions. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, USA) precursor solution was separately prepared by mixing the base monomers with a curing agent in a weight ratio of 10:1. The PDMS mixture was degassed in a vacuum by centrifuging for 3 min to remove air in the interior. The PDMS solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s onto another ITO/PET substrate and then cured at 100 °C for 5 min. In order to passivate the halide layer and eliminate the interfacial gap, the pre-cured PDMS film covered the annealed CsPbBr3 film and the full structure of PET/ITO/PDMS/CsPbBr3/ITO/PET was cured again for 1 h. The PDMS film had a thickness of ∼16 μm. External Cu wire electrodes were connected to the ITO sides. The fabricated energy harvester was sealed with PI tape to complete a gap-free harvester. For electrical poling, a high DC voltage of up to 25 kV cm−1 was applied to the annealed films at room temperature for 10 min.
Energy harvester characterization
A bending–releasing cycle was applied with an adjustable curvature of the bent sample to characterize the piezoelectric energy harvesting behavior. Measurements were conducted at various bending frequencies of 0.1 to 2.5 Hz using a commercial 1-axis high-speed fatigue machine (CTLM500, Ceratorq Inc., Korea) on which the bending conditions such as the bending frequency and curvature can be programmed. The output voltage was measured using a nanovoltmeter (Keithley 2182A, ValueTronics, USA) under an input impedance of 10 MΩ ± 1% in low-noise mode with a resolution of 100 nV. The output current was recorded using a galvanostat (IviumStat, Ivium Technologies, Netherlands). In vivo tests were further performed for the harvester samples to monitor physiological signals in terms of electrical currents recorded owing to various body motions. Actual motions such as blinking, throat movements, and finger operations were selected to correlate the sensitivity of the energy conversion to each regular body motion. All measurements were carried out immediately after device fabrication.

Broader context
Halide perovskite materials may be suitable for future electronic and power applications due to their unique advantages in electrical properties and low-temperature processing. Beyond the great potential in photovoltaic cells, halide materials have been actively studied to search for other suitable applications with veiled characteristics. Piezoelectricity-related applications using halide perovskites are another area with unique potential. However, studies on piezoelectricity of halide perovskites are very limited probably due to the difficulty in fabricating high-quality samples, although the possession of ferroelectricity was theoretically estimated with calculated polarization values in the literature. Here, we report high piezoelectricity of representative inorganic halides, CsPbBr3, which were optimized with a poling process, and their energy harvesting and current-sensing characteristics in the form of thin films. This is the very first report of revealing an effective piezoelectric coefficient for any inorganic halide perovskite and demonstrating piezoelectric energy harvesting performance using inorganic halides. The origin of the high piezoelectricity in inorganic halides is pursued via structural estimation associated with the changes in bonding angles. As expected from the high piezoelectricity, the electromechanical energy-harvesting performance is very competitive compared to any reported values even for hybrid halide thin films.
