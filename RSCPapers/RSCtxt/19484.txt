    , Accepted 7th August 2014First published on 11th August 2014AbstractIn the current work, we report a series of bifacial dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) that provide power conversion efficiencies of more than 10% from bifacial irradiation. The device comprises an N719-sensitized TiO2 anode, a transparent nickel selenide (Ni–Se) alloy counter electrode (CE), and liquid electrolyte containing I−/I3− redox couples. Because of the high optical transparency, electron conduction ability, electrocatalytic activity of Ni–Se CEs, as well as dye illumination, electron excitation and power conversion efficiency have been remarkably enhanced. Results indicate that incident light from a transparent CE has a compensation effect to the light from the anode. The impressive efficiency along with simple preparation of the cost-effective Ni–Se alloy CEs highlights the potential application of bifacial illumination technique in robust DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Solar energy accounts for 99% of total energy on earth; therefore, it is a promising solution to the state-of-the-art global energy and environmental problems.1 Among diversified solar utilization, photovoltaic conversion is considered to be the most direct and efficient strategy, in which solar energy is converted into electricity by a complicated electrochemical process with the advantages of low environmental impact and cost-effectiveness. In comparison with commercialized silicon solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) developed by Grätzel have attracted growing interest because of their merits regarding easy fabrication process, relatively high efficiency, and curved surface application.2–5 Since the first prototype reported in 1991,2 DSSCs have experienced a development period of double decenniums, and power conversion efficiency has also been increased from 7.1 to 13%.6 However, the steps for further efficiency enhancement and commercialization are held back by the high expense of traditional Pt counter electrode (CE) and gradient decrease in incident light intensity.7–9 Therefore, an alternative approach is to explore innovative techniques and alternative CEs for increasing cell efficiency and reducing cost expense. Pursuing high power conversion efficiency with no sacrifice of cost-effectiveness has been a long-term objective for DSSCs. One promising solution for this is to increase light harvesting. Previous efforts on light harvesting have been made on setting blocking layer, reflecting layer, or adding light harvester, resulting in tedious procedures without reducing expenses. Bifacial DSSCs created by Grätzel display the advantages of generating electricity on both the sides and help reduce the cost of solar-to-electric conversion.10,11 Previous works mainly focus on either the front or rear irradiation;12–14 therefore, the dilemma of gradient descent of incident light intensity within anode remains unchanged.15,16 After a careful literature survey, we are inspired by the design of cost-effective bifacial silicon solar cells, in which efficiencies from front, rear, and both irradiation are 17.0%, 7.1%, and 24.0% (front: 100 mW cm−2, rear: 42 mW cm−2), respectively.17,18 An effective bifacial operation requires the fine tuning of numerous aspects. The main issue is the transparency of the rear side of DSSC (i.e. CE in a real device). CEs from Pt based materials can provide good electron-conduction and high catalytic performance but poor transparency, which is one of the main issues for the development of current bifacial DSSCs. Another important factor is the cost-effectiveness and stability of the as-expected transparent CE materials. Although CE candidates, such as polyaniline and graphene, show high catalytic activity toward liquid electrolyte containing I−/I3− redox couples, the long-term stability is still unsatisfactory.19
With an aim of markedly enhancing the light absorption, here we combine the concept of bifacial irradiation with transparent but cost-effective nickel selenide (Ni–Se) binary alloy CEs synthesized by a mild solution strategy. Kim et al. employed NiCu or PdCo doped carbon nanofibers as CE materials, showing an efficiency of 3.5% and 2.5% in their DSSC devices, respectively.20,21 More recently, we reported the synthesis of cost-effective alloy CEs by an electrochemical deposition route for efficient DSSC application by adjusting deposition potentials, giving an impressive efficiency of 10.23% from CoPt0.02 alloy CE.22,23 In addition, a series of PtRu alloys were deposited onto conductive glass substrate by a hydrothermal reduction method, showing an efficiency of 6.80% from PtRu3 alloy CE based DSSC.24 Although the research on binary alloy CEs is in a preliminary state, the impressive photovoltaic performances have demonstrated the alloys to be good alternatives for DSSC application. In the current bifacial DSSC, the incident light can penetrate Ni–Se alloy CE and compensate for the light from anode side, leading to an enhanced dye excitation and electron density on the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 nanocrystallite.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of binary Ni–Se alloy CEs
The feasibility of synthesizing Ni–Se alloy CEs was confirmed by following experimental procedures: a mixing aqueous solution consisting of Se powders and Ni(NO3)2 in stoichiometric ratios was prepared by agitating 0.095 g of Se ultrafine powders and Ni(NO3)2 (0.0202 g for Ni0.6Se, 0.0244 g for Ni0.7Se, 0.0291 g for Ni0.85Se, 0.0349 g for NiSe) aqueous solution. The total volume of the reagent solution was adjusted at 35 ml by adding deionized water. 7.5 ml of hydrazine hydrate (85 wt%) was dropped into the abovementioned solution and after vigorous agitation for 10 min, the reactant was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and cleaned FTO glass substrate (sheet resistance 12 Ω square−1, purchased from Hartford Glass Co., USA) was leant against the inner wall with FTO surface downward. After reaction at 120 °C for 12 h, the FTO substrate was rinsed by deionized water and vacuum dried at 50 °C. The pure Se and Ni CEs were also prepared as references according to the abovementioned approach at a Se dosage of 0.095 g or Ni(NO3)2 dosage of 0.0349 g. The Pt CE (300–400 μm in thickness) was purchased from Dalian HepatChroma SolarTech Co., Ltd and was used as a standard.
2.2 Assembly of DSSCs
A layer of TiO2 nanocrystal anode film with a thickness of ∼10 μm was prepared by a sol-hydrothermal method.15,16 Resultant anodes were further sensitized by immersing into a 0.50 mM ethanol solution of N719 dye. The DSSC was fabricated by sandwiching redox electrolyte between a dye-sensitized TiO2 anode and a CE. A redox electrolyte consisted of 100 mM of tetraethylammonium iodide, 100 mM of tetramethylammonium iodide, 100 mM of tetrabutylammonium iodide, 100 mM of NaI, 100 mM of KI, 100 mM of LiI, 50 mM of I2, and 500 mM of 4-tert-butyl-pyridine in 50 ml acetonitrile. Surlyn film (30 μm) was utilized to seal the device through hot-pressing.
2.3 Electrochemical characterizations
The electrochemical performances were recorded on a conventional CHI660E setup comprising an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a CE of Pt sheet, and a working electrode of FTO glass supported Ni–Se alloy. The CV curves were recorded in a supporting electrolyte consisting of 50 mM M LiI, 10 mM I2, and 500 mM LiClO4 in acetonitrile. EIS measurements were also carried out in a frequency range of 0.1 Hz ∼ 105 kHz and an ac amplitude of 10 mV at room temperature. Tafel polarization curves were recorded by assembling symmetric dummy cell consisting of CE|redox electrolyte|CE.
2.4 Photovoltaic measurements
The photovoltaic test of the DSSC with an active area of 0.25 cm2 was carried out by measuring the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation under irradiation of simulated solar light from a 100 W Xenon arc lamp (XQ-500 W) in ambient atmosphere. The incident light intensity was controlled at 100 mW cm−2 (calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell). A black mask with an aperture area of around 0.25 cm2 was applied on the surface of DSSCs to avoid stray light.
2.5 Other characterizations
The optical transmission spectra of resultant CEs were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer at room temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of the resultant alloys were recorded on an X-ray powder diffractometer (X'pert MPD Pro, Philips, Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.542 Å) in the 2θ range of 20 to 80°, operating at 40 kV accelerating voltage and 40 mA current). The morphologies of the resultant Ni0.85Se alloy were observed on a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM2010, JEOL).
3. Results and discussion
The compositions of the resultant Ni–Se alloys were determined by ICP-AES measurement, displaying atomic ratios of Ni0.6Se, Ni0.7Se, Ni0.85Se, and NiSe of 0.608:1.000, 0.692:1.000, 0.836:1.000, and 1.021:1.000, respectively. The measured atomic ratios are close to their stoichiometries; therefore, the chemical formulae of the alloy CEs can be expressed by stoichiometric ratios. The crystalline structures were subjected to XRD analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, XRD results indicate that the resultant samples are Ni–Se alloys (PDF# 88-1711). No diffraction peaks attributing to pure Se (PDF# 73-0465) or pure Ni (PDF# 87-0712) are detected, indicating that Se and Ni have completely alloyed into Ni–Se alloys. Ni is a typical transition metal with unfilled valence in the d orbital. Therefore, the alloying of Ni with Se can accept electrons to form coordinated intermediates, which is a prerequisite for robust CE materials.

Fig. 2 shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) photographs of Ni0.85Se alloy. Because of the loose structure in Fig. 2a, the alloy CE provides large alloy–electrolyte interface and channels for ion diffusion and more active sites for I3− reduction. The clear observation of lattice fringes in Fig. 2b indicates that the nanoparticle structured Ni0.85Se alloy has good crystallinity. The interplanar spacings of d101 derived from the lattice fringes are 3.04 Å. Moreover, there are numerous lattice distortions and plenty of defects observed in their alloying region. By calculating the crystal lattice distortion from Δd/d = β/4tgθ (β is the line width at half-maximum height, θ is diffraction angle),25 they are 0.00157, 0.00174, 0.00201, and 0.00178 for Ni0.6Se, Ni0.7Se, Ni0.85Se, and NiSe alloys, respectively. This result demonstrates that the alloying of Ni and Se can generate several defects, which provides placeholders for I3− adsorption and reduction. A higher Δd/d in Ni–Se alloy is expected to have more active sites for accelerating the reduction reaction of I3− species.

The exploration of transparent CEs with high transparency in the visible-light region appears to be crucial in realizing the bifacial irradiation from front and rear sides. As shown in Fig. 3a, the resultant Ni–Se alloys have high optical transparency in visible region, penetrating incident light for dye excitation and electron generation at rear irradiation. Fig. 3b shows the characteristic J–V curves of the DSSCs irradiated from front side, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The cell device with Ni0.85Se alloy CE yield a maximum front η of 7.85% (Jsc = 16.59 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.741 V, and FF of 63.9%) under simulated air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) global sunlight, which is comparable to the cells from Pt (6.97%) and Pt-free CEs.26–28 As references, pure Se and pure Ni are also deposited on FTO glass substrates for DSSC fabrication, giving front η of 4.86% and 1.03%, respectively. Because of remarkable catalytic activities for Se and Ni electrodes, they have been widely used as electrocatalysts in synthesizing small molecular compounds and driving fuel cells.24,29,30 With respect to high optical transparency in visible region, simulated light can penetrate the rear sides of DSSC devices and generate solar energy conversion. As shown in Fig. 3c, an optimal rear η of 4.37% is recorded in the cell with Ni0.85Se alloy CE, which is 0.08% and 3.56% higher than for the DSSCs from Ni and Pt electrodes, respectively. Ni and Pt have metallic luster and thus the incident light can be reflected by luminous surfaces, leading to a low optimal transparency and dye excitation, which is supported by a lower rear Jsc in comparison with the front ones. Moreover, all the Voc values generated from the front irradiation are higher than that from the rear. To reveal the potential mechanism, schemes representing incident light descent and electron density on TiO2 anode are shown in Fig. S1.† Because intensity of incident light stepwise decreases within TiO2 film, electron distribution generated from excited dyes is diminishing. From this point of view, the electron recombination with I3− species (I3− + 2eCB−(TiO2) = 3I−) from front irradiation is retarded in comparison with rear irradiation. The maximum Voc is determined by the difference between the quasi Fermi energy of electrons in TiO2 and the redox potential energy of electrolyte,31 whereas the real Voc of the DSSCs is smaller than this theoretical limit because of a backward reaction between photogenerated electron and I3− species.32,33 Therefore, there is low electron loss for front irradiation and high Voc. Interestingly, a maximum η of 10.63% (Jsc = 24.34 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.737 V, and FF of 59.3%) in Fig. 3d is measured under both the irradiation for the cell with Ni0.85Se electrode. Statistical data on a larger batch of five bifacial DSSCs is shown in Fig. S2;† the small deviation (±7%) and high reproducibility demonstrate that bifacial DSSCs with excellent photovoltaic performances can be realized using the method reported here. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest η for I−/I3− redox couple based DSSCs with Pt-free CEs. Bifacial η follows an order of Ni0.85Se > NiSe > Pt > Ni0.7Se > Ni0.6Se > Se > Ni because of a synergistic effect of catalytic activity, charge-transfer ability, and optical transparency. The high dependence of the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs on stoichiometric ratios of Ni–Se alloy mainly results from the catalytic activities of alloy CEs. Therefore, we can deduce that the alloying of Ni and Se can generate different amount of defects for I3− reduction at various stoichiometries.

A golden rule in determining an effective CE for DSSC application is to enhance the catalytic activity for I3− reduction. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of CEs in liquid electrolyte containing I−/I3− redox couples have been widely employed to assess their catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 4a, all the electrodes exhibit two pairs of oxidation/reduction peaks (Ox1/Red1, Ox2/Red2). The shape and peak positions are similar to that of the Pt electrode, indicating that the alloy CEs have catalytic behaviors for the supporting electrolyte. With respect to CE function, the peak current density of Red1 and peak-to-peak separation (Epp) between Red1 and Ox1 are two parameters for evaluating catalytic activity. As summarized in Table 2, the peak current density of Red1 increases in the order of Ni0.85Se > NiSe > Pt > Ni0.7Se > Ni0.6Se > Se > Ni. The catalytic kinetics of CEs can be confirmed by electron lifetime (τ) on CE–electrolyte interface. In a real DSSC, the electrons excited from dyes will be collected by a CE through external circuit and participate in the reduction reaction of I3− + 2e → 3I−; therefore, τ is negatively related to catalytic activity. From Fig. 4b, the τ values are calculated to be Ni0.85Se (17.9 μs) < NiSe (22.5 μs) < Pt (27.0 μs) < Ni0.7Se (28.3 μs) < Ni0.6Se (34.8 μs) < Se (74.4 μs) < Ni (112.7 μs). Moreover, the Epp of Ni0.85Se electrode, a parameter negatively correlated with the standard electrochemical rate constant of a redox reaction, is 408.3 mV, whereas it is 636.2 mV for pure Pt electrode. This result indicates that the overpotential loss of Ni0.85Se CE is lower than that of the Pt electrode in DSSCs. Higher peak current density and lower Epp values suggest that the Ni0.85Se alloy electrode presents high catalytic activity in the reduction of I3− ions, which is an important prerequisite for a robust CE in DSSC application.34,35 Notably, the ratio of Jox1/|Jred1| is a parameter to elevate the reversibility of the redox reaction toward I−/I3−.36 The obtained value from Ni0.85Se alloy CE (1.272) is closer to 1.0 than Pt (1.407), indicating a more reversible redox reaction for I3− ↔ I−. The rapid recovery of I3− to I− facilitates the participation in subsequent circles and improves the long-term stability. From an outward extension of the peak positions in stacking CV curves of Ni0.85Se alloy electrode, as shown in Fig. S3,† we can conclude that the redox reaction is a diffusion-controlled mechanism on alloy CEs.37 Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements are executed to investigate the charge-transfer ability, and the resulting Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 4c. The charge-transfer resistances (Rct), dictating the electrocatalytic activity of CE material, extracted from the equivalent circuit are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 4c shows that the Rct values follow the order of Ni0.85Se (2.96 Ω cm2) < NiSe (5.37 Ω cm2) < Pt (7.23 Ω cm2) < Ni0.7Se (15.02 Ω cm2) < Ni0.6Se (15.68 Ω cm2) < Se (20.20 Ω cm2) < Ni (80.09 Ω cm2), which is consistent with the trend observed in CV analysis. To cross-check the validity of the Rct, we measured the Tafel polarizations for the symmetric dummy cells. As shown in Fig. 3d, the exchange current density (J0) generated from the slopes for anodic or cathodic branches are in the order of Ni0.85Se > NiSe > Pt > Ni0.7Se > Ni0.6Se > Se > Ni. J0 is inversely proportional to Rct:7J0 = RT/nFRct, where R is the gas constant, T is absolute temperature, F is Faraday's constant. Apparently, the calculated Rct match the order in EIS and CV analysis. In addition, the intersection of the cathodic branch with Y-axis is determined as limiting diffusion current density (Jlim), a parameter that depends on the diffusion coefficient (Dn) of I−/I3− redox couples at CE–electrolyte interface. Jlim is proportional to Dn:38Jlim = 2nFCDn/l, where l is the distance between the electrodes in a dummy cell, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of I3−, and C is the I3− concentration. Apparently, both Jlim and Dn have a sequence of Ni0.85Se > NiSe > Pt > Ni0.7Se > Ni0.6Se > Se > Ni. Alternatively, Dn can also be described by Randles–Sevcik theory:39Jred = Kn1.5ACDn0.5v0.5, where Jred is the peak current density of Red1, K is a constant, A is the active area of the dummy cell, v is the scan rate for CV curves. As shown in Fig. 4a, the calculated Dn in CV measurement is consistent with that from the Tafel analysis.

Fast start-up and multiple start capabilities are two crucial requirements for engines and vehicles driven by solar panels, in which robust CEs are core components in starting motors. As shown in Fig. 5a, the photocurrent of the cell device employing Ni0.85Se alloy electrode has an abrupt increase on irradiation from front, rear, or both. No delay in time is recorded to start the solar cell, demonstrating that the Ni0.85Se alloy electrode is vigorous in collecting electrons and reducing I3− species. As a reference, the on–off switch of the cell device with a standard Pt electrode is also provided, as shown in Fig. 5c, giving a delay in reaching maximum current density. The result demonstrates that Ni0.85Se alloy exhibits a higher catalytic activity than that of the Pt electrode. With durable irradiation in each “on” state, there is no failure or attenuation in photocurrent density, suggesting a low electron recombination with I3−, which is in agreement with dark J–V curves in Fig. S3.† Moreover, start/stop cycling can be employed to evaluate the multiple start-up capability of a DSSC. After multiple start-up, the solar cell properties nearly remain unchanged, which is an essential prerequisite for the application of DSSCs in engines or vehicles. Another important performance in selecting robust CEs is their long-term stability; the photocurrent density versus time plots over 20 min demonstrate photocurrent stability on prolonged exposure to light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 5b, 84.8%, 77.4%, and 69.1% of initial photocurrent density are retained after 20 min of operation with irradiations from both, front, and rear, respectively. Although 20 min-test is far from demonstrating the long-term stability for a real DSSC device, the preliminary result suggests relatively good stability for the cell employing Ni0.85Se alloy electrode. Notably, the photocurrent density follows the order of bifacial > front > rear. The result further supports the compensation effect of incident light from transparent Ni–Se alloy CE to light from the photoanode.
 Fig. 5  The on–off switches with irradiation from front, rear and both were achieved by alternately illuminating (100 mW cm−2) and darkening (0 mW cm−2) the DSSC devices from (a) Ni0.85Se and (c) Pt electrodes at an interval of 25 s and 0 V. Photocurrent stabilities of the DSSC devices with (b) Ni0.85Se and (d) Pt electrodes under durable irradiations at 100 mW cm−2. 
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that the mild solution synthesis of Ni–Se alloys is an effective strategy for designing cost-effective and transparent CE materials and enhancing the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs. Ni0.85Se alloy exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward I3− species and charge-transfer ability than pure Pt electrode. The DSSC from Ni0.85Se alloy CE provides an impressive power conversion efficiency of 7.85%, 4.37%, and 10.63% for irradiations from front, rear, and both, respectively, which is superior to the cell performances from Pt CE. Moreover, the advantages of fast start-up, high multiple start capability, and good stability motivate the potential applications of such bifacial DSSCs in engines, vehicles and power sources. The research presented here is far from being optimized but these advantages along with cost-effective synthesis and scalable materials promise the new CEs to be strong candidates in bifacial DSSCs.
