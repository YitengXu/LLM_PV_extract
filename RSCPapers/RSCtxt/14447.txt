    , Accepted 27th June 2019First published on 30th June 2019AbstractThe design of advanced supercapacitors requires electrode materials that combine high surface area with a developed hierarchical porous structure to facilitate ion transport and electrolyte permeability. Herein, we report a cross-linking and in situ sulfuration strategy for synthesizing nickel sulfide (Ni3S2) nanocrystal-attached cobalt sulfide (Co9S8) encapsulated on three-dimensional (3D) N-doped hierarchical porous carbon (Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC). The Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC composite was extensively studied using different characterization technologies. The results revealed that the obtained material integrated the advantages of a developed N-doped carbon framework (fast ion transport and excellent electrical conductivity) and transition metal sulfide species (high theoretical specific capacitance). Benefiting from the synergistic effect of a strawberry-like Ni3S2@Co9S8 structure and 3D interconnected hierarchical porous carbon, the resulting Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC composite exhibited an ultrahigh attractive specific capacitance of 1970.5 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 89.5% after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) of Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC//HPC was assembled in a 6 M KOH electrolyte. It delivered an energy density of 77.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 263.3 W kg−1, and it remained as high as 36.1 W h kg−1 even at 25.9 kW kg−1. It is believed that the presented work opens up a new strategy to fabricate high-performance supercapacitor electrodes.
1. Introduction
The explosively growing commercial market demands that portable electronics, computers, and communication and automotive electronics should possess the advantages of high energy/power densities, short charging-discharging time, long cycling performance, high reliability, low cost, and ecofriendly characteristics.1–5 Supercapacitors with fast charge–discharge rate, high power density and excellent cycling stability effectively overcome the drawback of batteries (lower power density). However, they also suffer from low energy densities.6–9 The increasing demand for supercapacitors with higher energy density continues to drive the development of electrode materials. To date, various electrodes such as carbon-based materials, conducting polymers and transition metal oxides/hydroxides have been extensively studied.10–12 However, despite great progress, the inherent flaws of these electrodes, including low energy density of carbonaceous materials, poor cycling stability of conducting polymers and low electrical conductivity of transition oxides/hydroxides, have seriously hindered their practical applications.13–15 Consequently, there is a strong desire to develop novel electrode materials for improving the performance of supercapacitors.
As emerging porous crystalline materials, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted increasing attention for a wide range of applications in the fields of water splitting,16 hydrogen evolution,17 water purification,18 chemical sensors,19 energy storage and conversion,20 lithium-ion batteries21 and solar cells.22 Among them, MOFs have been regarded as promising materials for supercapacitors due to their high specific surface area and designable porous architecture. The multistage configuration of the microstructure provides large surface area and a well connected nanoporous structure, which is able to effectively promote charge transfer and the diffusion of electrolyte within electrodes. For example, Cu-based MOFs reported by Saraf et al. were demonstrated to possess a capacitance of nearly 685.33 F g−1 at 1.6 A g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte.23 Wang successfully fabricated ultrathin NiCo-MOF nanosheets by a facile ultrasonication at room temperature, resulting in an excellent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 1202.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1.24 Ni-MOF/CNT composites were successfully obtained by a solvothermal method, reported by Wen et al., which delivered an excellent electrochemical performance (1765 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1).25 It is well known that ZIF-67 is a kind of metal–organic framework with a cobalt central atom and 2-methylimidazole legend. Recently, it is usually explored as the precursor to prepare cobalt-based metal sulfides with various porous nanostructures. For example, Tian and co-workers synthesized hollow Co3S4 quasi-polyhedron/MWCNT composites from the ZIF-67/MWCNT precursor via a solvothermal process and subsequent crystallization by thermal annealing, which lead to improved specific capacity (638.5 F g−1 at 30 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability (capacitance retention of 78.9% after 5000 cycles).26 Jiang et al. fabricated amorphous CoS polyhedral nanocages by utilizing ZIF-67 nanocrystals as the template, which exhibited a high specific capacitance (1485 F g−1 at 1 A g−1).27 The currently favored mixed metal sulfides such as MxSy (M = Ni, Cu and Co) possess higher electrochemical activity and capacity than single-component sulfides due to multiple available oxidation states and faster electron transfer.28,29 However, the electrochemical activity of a single component metallic sulfide is still chemically poor, because of aggregation, dissolution and agglomeration during the processes of synthesis and operation, leading to intrinsically poor charge conductivity, self-passivity and reduced active surface area. To address these issues, dispersing an active component on the surface of a metal or metal sulfide may provide great potential for energy technology.30 The large surface area and abundant active groups effectively accelerate the homogeneous dispersion and stability of the active component. According to the previously reported work, NixSy show a high capacitance and CoxSy possess an outstanding rate capability and cycling performance. Therefore, the suitable design of a mixed bi-component metal sulfide (NixSy@CoxSy) composite with mixed valences (x and y values are adjustable) is greatly expected to provide a superior electrode by combining their advantages. Also, the richness in valences of transition-metals and elemental S facilitate charge storage through reversible faradaic redox reactions. So far, few studies have focused on the NixSy@CoxSy composite as a supercapacitor electrode material.
At the same time, other studies have shown that the electrochemical activity and stability of metal sulfides can be efficiently improved by combining them with conductive substrates.31 Various carbon-based materials, such as activated carbon, graphene, carbon nanotubes and biomass carbon, are widely used as supporting substrates owing to their prominent advantages of large specific surface area and excellent conductivity.32–35 Taking the low cost and sustainable development into consideration, biomass-derived carbon has gained much interest due to the low cost, large reserves and abundant functional groups. Especially with regard to liquid-phase carbon-rich precursors, they can be easily functionalized with N, P and S-containing polymers and coupled with metallic ions through the electrostatic or complex interaction. The combined properties of the 3D interconnected carbon framework, well-developed porosity and excellent conductivity endow the product with an outstanding electrochemical performance. For example, Ghosh et al. successfully synthesized a Ni@rGO-Ni3S2 hybrid by a two-step hydrothermal approach, exhibiting a maximum specific capacitance of 987.8 F g−1 at 1.5 A g−1.36 Recently, Ratha and Rout prepared a sheet-like WS2 composite with reduced graphene oxide by a facile temperature programmed method, showing a specific capacitance of 350 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1.37 As one of the promising biomass materials, sodium alginate (SA) could be employed as a carbon precursor to create metal–carbon hybrids through a high-temperature calcination process.38 In our previously reported work, core–shell Ni–NixPy@C composites immobilized on P-doped sponge-like porous carbon were successfully obtained by a simple high-temperature phosphorization strategy, which exhibited an ultrahigh specific capacity up to 1275 F g−1 at 1 A g−1.10 Inspired by the above studies, we tried to employ well-developed pores in alginate-based hydrogel beads as a reservoir of sulfur sources, utilize the strong complexation of SA with divalent Ni2+ ions to form nickel alginate (Ni-SA) hydrogel beads, and use the viscous nature of SA solution to introduce ZIF-67 polyhedra, to achieve a metal sulfide–carbon hybrid with high capacitive performance.
Herein, we report a high-efficiency in situ sulfurization strategy to synthesize Ni3S2@Co9S8 nanoparticles encapsulated on N-doped porous carbon during a temperature-programmed process. The preparation process was accompanied by storage of thiourea into the pores of Ni-SA hydrogel beads, insertion of ZIF-67 polyhedra inside Ni-SA beads, and vulcanization of nickel and cobalt ions at high temperature in N2. The obtained Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC exhibited a superior specific capacitance of 1970.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 (2.4-fold higher than that of Co9S8/N-HPC) and high rate capability (1060 F g−1 at 20 A g−1). In addition, the stable strawberry-like structure enabled the electrode to maintain 89.5% cycling stability after 5000 cycles. Moreover, the ASC with Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 and HPC as electrode materials exhibited a high energy density of 77.1 W h kg−1 at 263.3 W kg−1.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals and reagents
Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), potassium hydroxide (KOH, ≥99%), acetylene black, polytetrafluoroethylene and 2-methylimidazole (C4H6N2) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. (Shanghai, China). SA and thiourea (CH4N2S) were obtained from Aladdin. Deionized water was used throughout this work.
2.2 Materials synthesis

Synthesis of ZIF-67 and ZIF-NC-800. 
ZIF-67 polyhedra were prepared according to the previously reported work in the literature.39 In a typical synthesis, Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.9 g, 0.5 mmol) was mixed in deionized water (4 mL) to form a clear solution. This solution was gradually poured into deionized water solution (40 mL) containing 2-methylimidazole (11 g, 3.3 mmol). After thorough mixing, the solution was incubated at room temperature (25 °C) for 24 h. The as-obtained precipitate was centrifuged and washed with deionized water several times, resulting in the so-called ZIF-67 polyhedra. ZIF-NC-800 was synthesized by the direct carbonization of ZIF-67 at 800 °C in N2. The temperature of the tube furnace was increased gradually at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. After the target temperature was reached, the powder was annealed for 2 h and then cooled down to room temperature. Finally, the product was taken out, which showed a colour change from purple to black.


Synthesis of the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC composite. 
The Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC composite was prepared through annealing thiourea infiltrated nickel alginate beads with ZIF-67 (ZIF-67@S–Ni-SA) at high temperature in N2. In a typical preparation process, the above-synthesized ZIF-67 polyhedra (0.5 g) and thiourea (2 g) were dispersed in deionized water (100 mL). Then, SA powder (2 g) was added to the above mixed solution. After vigorous stirring for 6 h, the as-prepared suspension was added dropwise to a Ni(NO3)2·6H2O solution (2.5 wt%) under continuous magnetic stirring conditions to obtain ZIF-67@S–Ni-SA hydrogel beads. The product was repeatedly washed with water and ethanol 3 times. After that, the ZIF-67@S–Ni-SA hydrogel beads were collected by filtration, followed by freezing at −50 °C for 12 h and freeze-drying under vacuum conditions. Subsequently, the ZIF-67@S–Ni-SA aerogel beads were placed in a tube furnace at a preset temperature under the protection of N2. After being cooled in N2, the samples were repeatedly washed with deionized water to thoroughly remove other impurities. Finally, various products, named Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-X (X denotes the carbonization temperature, X = 600, 700, 800, and 900 °C, respectively) were obtained. And the as-prepared Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC composites were dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven. For comparison, Co9S8/N-HPC (without Ni(NO3)2) and Ni3S2/N-HPC (without ZIF-67 polyhedra) composites were also synthesized using a similar procedure.


Synthesis of HPC. 
In a typical procedure, SA powder (2 g) was added to deionized water (100 mL). After vigorous stirring for 6 h, the as-prepared mixture was added dropwise to a CaCl2 solution (5 wt%) under continuous magnetic stirring conditions. The obtained calcium alginate (Ca-SA) hydrogel beads were washed with deionized water and ethanol thoroughly. Afterwards, the samples were collected by filtration and frozen at −50 °C for 12 h. The corresponding aerogel beads were obtained by the freeze-drying technique. Finally, the Ca-SA aerogel beads were placed in a tube furnace and pyrolyzed at 800 °C under the protection of N2. After being cooled in N2, the products were washed with an HCl solution (1 M) to thoroughly remove the impurities. The sample was named HPC.

2.3 Structure characterization
The X-ray diffraction patterns for determining the crystal structures were acquired on an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, ESCALAB210) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 4 kV. And the XRD patterns were investigated in the 2θ range of 10–80° at a scan rate of 10° min−1. The specific surface area (SBET) and pore size distribution were determined using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller equation and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCA LAB 250) was conducted on a Thermo Escalab 250 using an Al Kα X-ray source to determine the surface elemental compositions of the samples. The microstructure and morphology information were observed using a field emission-scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEM JEOL 2100, 15 kV) with an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, Oxford, UK) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Hitachi H9000NAR, 200 kV).
2.4 Electrochemical characterization
The electrochemical performances of the samples were examined by galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance (EIS) on an electrochemical workstation (PARSTAT 4000, Germany). A three-electrode system was employed to investigate the electrochemical performances of the samples with a calomel electrode as the reference electrode, a platinum electrode as the counter electrode and a 6 M KOH solution as the aqueous electrolyte. The working electrode was synthesized in the following procedure: the as-prepared material, carbon black and polytetrafluoroethylene were mixed at a weight ratio of 80:10:10 and fabricated into a film and subsequently pressed between two nickel foams to shape the working electrode.
The specific capacitance (C, F g−1) can be calculated according to the following equations: (1)where I, Δt and ΔV represent the current density, discharge time and effective voltage excluding IR drop, respectively. m is the mass of the active electrode material.
In a two-electrode system, the electrochemical properties of the ASC were investigated using the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC composite as the positive electrode and HPC as the negative electrode. And the specific capacitance (Cm, F g−1), energy density (E, W h kg−1) and power density (P, W kg−1) of the ASC were calculated using the following equation: (2) (3) (4) (5)where M (g) is the total mass of the active material in the two electrodes of the ASC.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure characterization
The details of the synthetic method for ZIF-NC-800 and Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC composites are illustrated in Scheme 1. ZIF-67 polyhedra are simply prepared by the addition of 2-methylimidazole to a Co2+ ion solution. The obtained sample is characterized by XRD. And the pattern shows a typical ZIF-67 crystal.40 The carbonization of ZIF-67 at 800 °C gives rise to ZIF-NC-800. The formation mechanism of ZIF-67@S–Ni-SA beads is the complexation of Ni2+ ions with four G molecules in SA to form an “egg-box” structure.41,42 The as-prepared beads are dehydrated via a freeze-drying process to obtain ZIF-67@S–Ni-SA aerogel beads. Benefiting from the interconnected hierarchical porous structure of the aerogel, which has been already proved in our previously reported work, thiourea can be stored inside the beads.10 Subsequently, the ZIF-67@S–Ni-SA aerogel beads are heated at high temperature in N2, so that the chelation between Ni2+ ions and SA is weakened. Because of the strong adsorption capacity of ZIF-67 after high temperature carbonization, Ni species are deposited on the surface of ZIF-67 polyhedra. The strawberry-like Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC composite is successfully achieved during the in situ sulfuration process.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of preparation of ZIF-NC-800 and Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800. 
XRD patterns are obtained in order to characterize the crystal structure of the samples. Fig. 1a shows the typical XRD patterns of ZIF-67, ZIF-NC-800, Co9S8/N-HPC-800, Ni3S2/N-HPC-800 and Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 composites, respectively. The XRD diffraction peaks of ZIF-67 polyhedra are identical to the previously reported result.43 After the calcination at 800 °C in N2, the XRD diffraction of ZIF-NC-800 belongs to Co (111), (200) and (220) lattice planes. In the XRD pattern of Co9S8/N-HPC-800, diffraction peaks centered at 15.48, 29.41, 31.25, 39.62, 47.66, 52.19, 61.31, 62.10, 73.34 and 76.93° are observed. All these peaks can be attributed to the diffraction of (111), (311), (222), (331), (511), (400), (533), (622), (731) and (800) crystal planes of cubic phase Co9S8 (JCPDS: PDF#85–1802). For the Ni3S2/N-HPC-800 composite, the characteristic diffraction peaks of Ni3S2 are observed. In detail, a list of peaks at 2θ of 21.76, 27.51, 31.10, 38.28, 43.25, 44.35, 49.73, 54.61, 73.04 and 77.87° are consistent with the (010), (221), (110), (111), (020), (120), (121), (130) and (311) crystal planes of the Ni3S2 phase (JCPDS: PDF# 86-2273), respectively. In addition, the XRD pattern of the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 composite shows the characteristic diffraction peaks of both Co9S8 and Ni3S2, which confirms that Co9S8 and Ni3S2 nanoparticles are successfully encapsulated on N-doped porous carbon, in agreement with the SEM and EDS results.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of ZIF-67 polyhedra, ZIF-NC-800, Co9S8/N-HPC-800, Ni3S2/N-HPC-800 and Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800. 
Additionally, the structural characteristics of the samples are further comparatively investigated using N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and BJH pore size distribution analysis. Fig. 2a indicates that the SBET of ZIF-67 is 24.5 m2 g−1. After calcination, the SBET of ZIF-NC-800 is as high as 1602.4 m2 g−1. The specific surface area of micropores (Smic) accounts for more than 80% of the total SBET. The pore size distribution calculated by the BJH method shows a narrow range of 0–4 nm and the average pore size is 1.58 nm (Fig. 2b, Table 1). And the Co9S8/N-HPC-800, Ni3S2/N-HPC-800 and Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 composites show a typical type-IV isotherm with a H3-type hysteresis loop at a relative pressure of 0.45–1.0, indicating a large amount of mesopores in these samples. It should be mentioned that the average pore sizes of Co9S8/N-HPC-800, Ni3S2/N-HPC-800 and Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 are concentrated in the range of 3–10 nm, which not only could favour the electron transfer but also allows the easy access and transport of the electrolyte during the charge–discharge process, therefore contributing to the enhancement of the electrochemical performance.44 The novel structure of Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC provides a high specific area (360.1 m2 g−1) and enhanced pore volume (0.258 cm3 g−1). Moreover, the SBET values of Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-600, Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-700 and Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-900 are 122.8, 274.7 and 46.2 m2 g−1, respectively (Table S1, Fig. S1†). With the increase of the annealing temperature, the SBET of the samples increases first and then decreases. This is because the alginate-based porous carbon skeleton collapses at 900 °C, as shown in Fig. S2,† which is consistent with the previously reported result.45 It should be pointed out that the average pore sizes of all samples are concentrated in the range of 4–6 nm, as shown in Fig. S3.† The large surface area, developed porous structure and high pore volume of the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC composite are important for the fast ion transport and easy access of the electrolyte.46

More detailed information about the elemental composition and surface electronic states of ZIF-NC-800 and Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 is obtained by XPS analysis. As shown in Fig. 3a, the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 composite contains Ni 2p, Co 2p, O 1s, C 1s, N 1s and S 2p in the full spectrum. Among them, the contents of the elements on the surface of ZIF-NC-800 and Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 composites are shown in Table S2.† In Fig. 3b, the Co 2p spectrum of ZIF-NC-800 shows two main peaks at 796.9 eV and 781.1 eV, which correspond to the Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 spin–orbit peaks, and two accompanying shake-up satellite peaks at 802.5 eV and 786.2 eV, respectively.47 For Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800, the Ni 2p spectrum exhibits different oxidation states related to Ni2+ and Ni3+ (Fig. 3c). Two doublets positioned at 852.5 and 872.3 eV and at 858.2 and 875.5 eV agree with Ni2+ and Ni3+ of Ni3S2, respectively. In the high-resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p (Fig. 3d), two spin–orbit doublets together with two shakeup satellites could be observed, matching well with Co3+ (781.1, 793.6 eV) and Co2+ (783.2, 796.5 eV). Fig. 3e shows the S 2p XPS spectrum, and the raw curve is fitted into five curves. The peaks at 158.4 and 161.1 eV are attributed to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of the Co9S8 phase. And the peaks centered at 159.8 and 162.2 eV are attributed to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of the Ni3S2 phase. The remaining peak at 165.7 eV corresponds to SO42− ions. The existence of SO42− ions is because of the partly oxidized S species on the surface of the hybrid. In another regard, the high-resolution N 1s spectrum can be divided into three peaks, corresponding to pyridinic-N (395.3 eV), pyrrolic-N (399.1 eV) and oxide-N (402.5 eV) (Fig. 3f). The C 1s spectrum of Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 further indicates that C mainly exists in the form of C–C (282.1 eV), C–N (283.2 eV) and CN (285.7 eV) (Fig. S4a†). Also, the O 1s XPS spectrum of Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 is shown in Fig. S4b.† These results strongly support that the N atoms are successfully doped into the porous carbon through the programmed heating process. Therefore, the obtained product has the characteristics of Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC. The results are in good agreement with XRD characterization.

In order to obtain the information about the morphology and microstructure of the samples, FESEM and TEM characterization was performed and the results are shown in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4a, the ZIF-67 polyhedra show a rhombic dodecahedron shape with a smooth surface and the average size is around 800–900 nm. Panoramic views of the SEM image show that the sample ZIF-NC-800 obtained by carbonization inherits the original shape of ZIF-67 (Fig. 4b). The size of the as-prepared particles is the same as that of ZIF-67. However, it can be clearly observed that the surface of ZIF-NC-800 has become little rougher (Fig. 4c). Fig. 4d displays the TEM image of ZIF-NC-800. The HRTEM image in Fig. 4e demonstrates that Co nanoparticles with a mean size of 3 nm are uniformly distributed on the ZIF-NC-800 polyhedra. For the nanoparticles, lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.174 nm are observed from the HRTEM image, which match well with the fringe distance of the (200) plane of the cubic spinel Co phase.48 The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 4f, inset) shows clear diffraction rings, demonstrating their crystal characteristics. In order to further investigate the elemental composition of ZIF-NC-800, EDS mapping is used to represent the distribution of the elements with different colors (Fig. S5†). The elemental content of ZIF-NC-800 is also shown in Table S2.† As a control, Fig. 4g shows the SEM image of pure HPC with a highly developed porous structure. Fig. S6 and Table S3† provide the structural characteristics of HPC. In Fig. 4h, the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 composite presents a porous configuration with 3D interconnected pores. The strawberry-like Ni3S2@Co9S8 hetero-nanoparticles with a uniform size distribution are immobilized on the porous carbonaceous structure. A close observation of Fig. 4i shows that numerous strawberry-like Ni3S2@Co9S8 particles with an average diameter of 900 nm are well scattered on the surface of the carbon network. Such a developed porous structure is able to confine the nanoparticles within the 3D interconnected framework, which adequately prevents the Ni3S2@Co9S8 active component leakage during the charge–discharge process. In addition, the biomass-derived porous carbon carrier with a high specific surface area and developed porous structure can not only effectively improve the stability and conductivity of the electrode, but also greatly shorten the channel of electrolyte ion transfer. Therefore, the obtained material can achieve excellent electrochemical performance. The corresponding TEM pattern shows the structure of the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 composite. Fig. 4j exhibits that the Ni3S2 nanoparticles are distributed on the surface of the polyhedron to form a unique strawberry-like structure. And the HRTEM images clearly show that the lattice fringes associated with a spacing of ∼0.24 and 0.29 nm are in agreement with the (111) and (311) planes of Co9S8 and Ni3S2. The corresponding SAED pattern is depicted in the inset of Fig. 4k, where the diffraction spots and rings correspond to polycrystalline Ni3S2@Co9S8 composites. To easily imagine the structural formation of the prepared composites, the elemental mapping images are shown in Fig. 4l, where it can be seen that the elements Co, Ni, S and N are smoothly distributed on the surface of the sample.

The electrochemical performance of Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte is evaluated by CV, GCD and EIS techniques using a three-electrode device. A pair of redox current peaks is clearly observed in the CV curves of the samples from −0.1 to 0.5 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (Fig. 5a). Among all these Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC composites at different temperature, Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 exhibits the most apparent redox peaks and the largest integrated area, demonstrating the ideal pseudocapacitive characteristic and superior capacitive behavior. The capacity storage performance of these samples is further evaluated by GCD measurement, which is conducted in a potential range of 0–0.5 V at 0.5 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 5b, the GCD curves of Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-600, Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-700, Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 and Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-900 composites exhibit a symmetric line-type curve with an obvious discharge plateau located at 0.24–0.28 V, corresponding to reversible faradaic reactions.44 The specific capacitance of the samples is calculated from the discharge curves based on eqn (2). Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 shows a high specific capacitance of 1970.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, which is higher than that of Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-600 (885.1 F g−1), Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-700 (1713.2 F g−1) and Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-900 (748.1 F g−1) (Fig. 5c). Moreover, compared with the previously reported studies related to MOF-based electrode materials shown in Table S4,† Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 exhibits outstanding capacitive performance. As confirmed in Fig. 5d, the charge transfer resistance (act) values of Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-600, Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-700, Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 and Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-900 are 0.86 Ω, 0.52 Ω, 0.13 Ω, and 1.02 Ω, respectively, which implies that Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 possesses enhanced conductivity and exhibits rapid charge transfer. In addition, their internal resistance values are 0.81 Ω, 0.60 Ω, 0.52 Ω, and 0.96 Ω, respectively. Fig. 5e shows the typical CV curves of the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 composites at various scan rates ranging from 5 to 100 mV s−1. Two pairs of redox peaks corresponding to the reversible faradaic reactions can be observed, especially at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, revealing the pseudocapacitive characteristic of Ni3S2 and Co9S8. The related surface faradaic redox reaction can be described as the following reactions: Co9S8 + 9OH− ↔ Co9S8(OH)9 + 9e−(6) Ni3S2 + 3OH− ↔ Ni3S2(OH)3 + 3e−(7)

(i) Normalized contribution ratio of capacitive and diffusion-controlled processes of the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 composite at different scan rates. 
With an increase of the scan rate, there is no significant change of the curves, suggesting that the electrode material is favorable for rapid redox reactions. As expected, a shift in the current peak position is observed when increasing the scan rate, which is due to the internal resistance of the electrode. The GCD curves of Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 at different current densities are shown in Fig. 5f. A good symmetry of the curves reveals the reversible charge–discharge behavior. Two distinct voltage plateaus in good agreement with the redox peaks are observed. Moreover, the CV and GCD curves of Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-600, Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-700 and Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-900 composites are shown in Fig. S7, S8 and S9,† respectively. By comparison, the same conclusion can be made for Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800.
To better understand the electrochemical reaction kinetics of the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 electrode, the role of the two different charge-storage processes is further studied based on the CV curves. As we know, the total charge storage of the electrode arises from two components: the diffusion-controlled reaction and the surface-limited capacitance. In theory, the above two components can be identified by analyzing the dependence of the CV current response (i) on the scan rate (ν) according to eqn (8): i = avb(8)where a and b are adjustable constants, b can be determined from the slope of the plot of logi versus logν. It is worth noting that if b ≤ 0.5, the capacitance contribution corresponds to diffusion-controlled reactions, whereas if b ≥ 1, it will be the surface-controlled reactions. Therefore, a diffusion- or surface-controlled electrochemical process could be readily distinguished based on the value of b. As shown in Fig. 5h, the calculated b for the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 composite ranges from 0.6 to 1.2 at various potentials, implying that the electrochemical reactions for the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 composite in the KOH electrolyte are associated with both diffusion-controlled (battery-type) and surface-controlled (capacitive-type) processes.49 And the capacitance contribution to the total capacity could be further quantitatively estimated based on the following equation: i(V) = k1v + k2v1/2(9)where i(V) is the current response at a specific potential V, v is the scan rate, and k1v and k2v1/2 are surface- and diffusion-controlled currents, respectively. By determining k1 and k2, it is feasible to calculate the contribution of surface- and diffusion-controlled capacitance. As shown in Fig. 5h, the shaded region in the CV curve indicates the capacitive contribution from the surface-controlled process. The values of k1 (slope) and k2 (intercept) can be obtained from the linear relationship between i(V)/v1/2 and v1/2 at different potentials.50 These values are used to evaluate the currents from surface- and diffusion-controlled processes at specific potentials. Fig. 5i shows the charge-storage contribution of diffusion- and surface-controlled processes of the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 composite at different scan rates. The surface capacitive charge contribution increases with the increase of the scan rate, and it accounts for 71.5% of the total charge storage at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, and 85.3% at 50 mV s−1. In other words, surface capacitive behavior dominates the charge storage at the high charge–discharge rates.
In order to further investigate the effect of the unique structure on the electrochemical properties, the electrochemical performances of Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800, Co9S8/N-HPC-800, Ni3S2/N-HPC-800 and ZIF-NC-800 composites were measured in a three-electrode system using 6 M KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte. The CV curves at different scan rates and GCD curves at various current densities for Co9S8/N-HPC-800 are shown in Fig. S10, S11 and S12,† respectively. The CV curves show a pair of centrally symmetric redox peaks, which correspond to the reversible redox transition. Fig. 6a shows the CV curves of Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800, Co9S8/N-HPC-800, Ni3S2/N-HPC-800 and ZIF-NC-800 composites at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Obviously, the CV curve of Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 has a larger integrated area than that of Co9S8/N-HPC-800, Ni3S2/N-HPC-800 and ZIF-NC-800, which proves that Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 exhibits a better electrochemical storage ability. Because of the synergistic effect between the unique strawberry-like structure and hierarchical porous carbon skeleton, the curve of the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 electrode shows that it maintains a longer discharge time than other samples (Fig. 6b). As shown in Fig. 6c, the electronic conductivity and ion diffusion properties of the electrode are elucidated using Nyquist plots. In this work, Rct values of the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 electrode are calculated using Zview 3.1, and they represent the charge transfer resistance and solution resistance. Notably, Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 exhibits a smaller resistance encountered by the ion transportation (0.13 Ω) compared with Co9S8/N-HPC-800 (1.03 Ω), Ni3S2/N-HPC-800 (1.25 Ω) and ZIF-NC-800 (1.82 Ω). The specific capacitances of Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800, Co9S8/N-HPC-700, Ni3S2/N-HPC-800 and ZIF-NC-800 composites are 1970.5, 858.5, 595.6 and 590.6 F g−1, respectively, as recorded in Fig. 6d. Based on the above results, it is found that the unique strawberry-like structure (Ni3S2@Co9S8) greatly improves during the process of charging and discharging. In addition, the developed hierarchical porous carbonaceous skeleton provides more efficient and convenient channels for the rapid transfer of electrolyte ions, greatly improving the charge–discharge efficiency and realizing high specific capacitance. An ASC is fabricated using the as-prepared HPC and Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC as the negative electrode and positive electrode, respectively, to further investigate the practical application of the optimized electrode (Fig. 7a). The electrochemical characterization of HPC is shown in Fig. S13.† The CV curves of the HPC electrode shown in Fig. S13a,† acquired at different scan rates in the 6 M KOH solution, are rectangular between −1 V and 0 V, which clearly shows the typical double-layer capacitive behavior. As shown in Fig. 7b, the voltage windows of HPC and Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 electrodes are −1 to 0 V and −0.1 to 0.5 V, respectively. A series of CV plots of the ASC at different potential windows at 50 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 7c. As the potential window gradually expands to 1.7 V, polarization of the ASC begins to appear. Therefore, it can be clearly found that the stable voltage window of the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800//HPC ASC can be extended to 1.6 V without any distinguishable polarization curves, which can be verified from the CV and GCD curves of the fabricated Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800//HPC ASC within a voltage window of 0 to 1.6 V (Fig. 7d and e). In Fig. 7d, the shape of the CV curves indicates that the capacitance comes from the combined contribution of both pseudocapacitance and electric double-layer capacitance. To evaluate the charge–discharge capacity, the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800//HPC ASC is characterized using a series of GCD tests with a current density up to 50 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 7e, the GCD curves indicate that the ASC can basically maintain a symmetric charge–discharge process with the current density increase from 0.5 to 50 A g−1, indicating high coulombic efficiency. The Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800//HPC ASC shows a capacitance as high as 333.9 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and retains 156.3 F g−1 even at a high current density of 50 A g−1, as recorded in Fig. 7f. It is a wonder that the as-assembled ASC presents outstanding cycling stability. At a current density of 10 A g−1, the retention rate after 5000 cycles is 89.5%, as demonstrated in Fig. 7g. The excellent cycling stability of the obtained materials is attributed to the interconnected N-doped framework (fast ion transport, excellent electrical conductivity and effective protection of active sites) and unique configuration of Ni3S2@Co9S8 nanocomposites (high theoretical specific capacitance). In addition, the illustration in Fig. 7g shows the CV curves of the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800//HPC ASC after 1 cycle and 5000 cycles. The CV area of 5000 cycles almost coincides with that of 1 cycle, which indicates that the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800//HPC ASC maintains excellent cycling stability. As shown in Fig. S14,† it is noted that the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 electrode presents better cycling stability after 5000 cycles compared with Co9S8/N-HPC-800 and Ni3S2/N-HPC-800. Moreover, Co9S8/N-HPC-700, Ni3S2/N-HPC-800 and ZIF-NC-800 composites as the anode electrode and HPC as the negative electrode are also tested. The CV and GCD curves are displayed in Fig. S15–S17.† These results indicate that the well-designed Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 is an ideal material for supercapacitor electrodes.

Fig. 8a shows the Ragone plot of the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800//HPC ASC. It can be seen that the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800//HPC ASC delivers a superior energy density of 77.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 263.3 W kg−1 and still maintains 36.1 W h kg−1 even at an extremely high power density of 25.9 kW kg−1, indicating an impressive power capability. More importantly, the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800//HPC ASC has the maximum energy density compared with previously reported electrode materials, such as Ni3S2@C/rGO//AC (52.5 W h kg−1 at 750 W kg−1 and 31.3 W h kg−1 at 7500 W kg−1),51 GH@NC@Co9S8//GH@NC (23.6 W h kg−1 at 800 W kg−1),52 Ni@Ni3S2/Co9S8/NiSe//AC (17.8 W h kg−1 at 4945.2 W kg−1),53 ZIF-NCS//AC (44.8 W h kg−1 at 794.5 W kg−1 and 37.7 W h kg−1 at 7981.1 W kg−1),44 Co9S8@Ni(OH)2//AC (55.8 W h kg−1 at 695.2 W kg−1 and 23.8 W h kg−1 at 6788.6 W kg−1),54 Ni@rGO-Co9S8//Ni@rGO-Ni3S2 (31.4 W h kg−1 at 252.8 W kg−1 and 12.5 W h kg−1 at 2500 W kg−1),36 NF@rGO/Ni3S2//N-G (55.2 W h kg−1 at 975 W kg−1 and 24.8 W h kg−1 at 13 kW kg−1),55 Ni3S2@CoS//AC (32.6 W h kg−1 at 399.8 W kg−1 and 16.7 W h kg−1 at 8000.2 W kg−1)56 and NiCo2S4/NF//AC (28.2 W h kg−1 at 134.5 W kg−1).57Fig. 8b is transformed from Fig. 8a. Fig. 8b shows that the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800//HPC realizes both high specific energy and high specific power. Furthermore, an experiment of lighting a blue light-emitting diode (LED, potential 3 V) with the assembled ASC is performed and shown in Fig. 8c. The LED remains lit for almost 2.5 h. Also, the ASC device can make the digital stopwatch work properly. These results show that the as-fabricated Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800//HPC ASC device has low self-discharge characteristics and high output voltage, which are highly desirable for future portable electronics.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a unique strawberry-like Ni3S2@Co9S8 encapsulated on 3D N-doped hierarchical porous carbon composite was successfully prepared by the combination of the cross-linking process and subsequent high-temperature sulfuration treatment. The characterization results revealed that the N-doped carbon framework with a developed porous structure was coupled with Ni3S2 and Co9S8 species. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the strawberry-like Ni3S2@Co9S8 structure and 3D interconnected hierarchical porous carbon, the resulting Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC composite exhibited an attractive specific capacitance of 1970.5 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 89.5% after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1. Furthermore, an ASC assembled with the Ni3S2@Co9S8/N-HPC-800 positive electrode and an HPC negative electrode delivered a noticeably high energy density (77.1 W h kg−1) at a power density of 263.3 W kg−1 and still maintained 36.1 W h kg−1 even at an extremely high power density of 25.9 kW kg−1, which is higher than that of most ASCs reported in the literature. We believe that this synthesis strategy will open up a new way to obtain advanced electrochemical energy storage materials.
