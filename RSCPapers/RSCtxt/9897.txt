    , Accepted 2nd February 2022First published on 2nd February 2022AbstractTwo ADA′DA small molecule acceptors, IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F, with non-fully-fused core units were developed. The DA′D core units were facilely prepared via Stille coupling of D and A′ fused-ring building blocks. IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F show banana-shaped molecular configurations and good planarity. When blending with a wide-bandgap polymer donor L1-S, IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F delivered decent PCEs of 12.00% and 11.92%, respectively, in organic solar cells.
The emergence of acceptor–donor–acceptor′–donor–acceptor (ADA′DA) small molecule acceptors, represented by Y6, has accelerated the development of organic solar cells.1–5 Different from traditional ADA acceptors with an electron-rich core unit and a linear molecular configuration,6,7 Y6-type acceptors possess a less electron-rich fused-ring DA′D core unit and a banana-shaped configuration. These features significantly influence the molecular orbitals, optoelectronic properties, packing behaviour and charge transport properties of ADA′DA acceptors, resulting in high performance in solar cells.8,9 However, the synthesis of a fused-ring DA′D unit requires high-temperature Cadogan cyclization10 and the yield is moderate, thus increasing the cost. Recently, the development of small molecule acceptors with non-fused or non-fully-fused core units has received attention.11–20 Tedious cyclization steps are reduced in syntheses, thus reducing the cost. Some of them deliver high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in solar cells, which are even comparable to the fused counterparts. In this context, it is highly desirable to develop efficient non-fused or non-fully-fused ADA′DA acceptors. In this work, we designed and synthesized two non-fully-fused ADA′DA acceptors, IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F (Fig. 1). The DA′D core units were facilely constructed by coupling the D fragment, indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT), and the A′ fragment, dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DT-BT) or 5H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran-5-one (DTP). IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F present good performance in solar cells. By blending them with a wide-bandgap polymer donor L1-S,21 the IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F cells offered 12.00% and 11.92% PCEs, respectively.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures for Y6,1 IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F. 
The synthetic routes for IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F are shown in Schemes S1 and S2 (ESI†), respectively. The Stille coupling of DTBT (or DTP) ditin derivative with 7-bromo-4,4,9,9-tetraoctyl-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2-carbaldehyde gave a DA′D core unit, compound 1 (or compound 2), in 55% (or 90%) yield. Knoevenagel condensation of compound 1 (or compound 2) with 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile gave IDTBT-4F (or IDTP-4F) in 78% (or 63%) yield. All compounds were characterized by NMR and mass spectra (Fig. S1–S9, ESI†). The MALDI-TOF mass spectra gave the expected molecular ion peaks, 2154.521 and 2114.543, for IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F, respectively (Fig. S9, ESI†). Both IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F are well soluble in common organic solvents like chloroform and dichloromethane. To gain more structural information of IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The optimized molecular structures of IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F are shown in Fig. 2. The top views indicate that both molecules present a banana-shaped backbone since the D and A′ units adopt a trans arrangement. The side views indicate that IDTBT-4F is less planar than IDTP-4F. The lower planarity of IDTBT-4F is caused by the larger torsion angles between the D and A′ units. The torsion angles are 8.3° and 8.5° for IDTBT-4F, and 1.1° and 1.6° for IDTP-4F (Fig. 2).

IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F show similar absorption spectra in either solution or in films (Fig. 3b). In solution, IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F show a major absorption band at 540–780 nm, with a peak at 683 nm and 679 nm, respectively. In films, both peaks shift to 711 nm and the absorption band broadens, suggesting enhanced molecular packing in the solid state. The larger red-shift of the IDTBT-4F absorption spectrum from solution to film indicates a stronger J-aggregation22 of IDTBT-4F. The absorption onsets for IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F films are 791 nm and 795 nm, respectively, corresponding to optical bandgaps of 1.57 eV and 1.56 eV. The absorption spectrum of the L1-S film is also shown in Fig. 3b. L1-S has an absorption band at 400–660 nm, which is complementary to that of IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels for IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F were measured by using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method (Fig. S10, ESI†). An energy diagram is shown in Fig. 3c. IDTBT-4F has a LUMO of −3.76 eV, which is 0.09 eV higher than that of IDTP-4F (−3.85 eV), suggesting that IDTBT-4F may generate higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) in solar cells. The DFT calculations also indicate a higher LUMO of IDTBT-4F (Fig. S11, ESI†). The charge transport properties of IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F were studied by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S12, ESI†). Pure IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F films present electron mobilities of 3.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.63 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher electron mobility of IDTP-4F is due to the higher planarity of IDTP-4F, which facilitates molecular packing and enhances electron transport.

The photovoltaic performance of IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F was evaluated by making solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/L1-S:acceptor/PDIN/Ag. Device parameters including D/A ratio, active layer thickness and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive content were optimized (Tables S1–S6, ESI†). With a D/A ratio of 1:1, an active layer thickness of 102 nm and no DIO additive, L1-S:IDTBT-4F cells gave a PCE of 12.00%, with a Voc of 0.974 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 18.09 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 68.10% (Fig. 4 and Table 1). With a D/A ratio of 1:1, an active layer thickness of 99 nm and 0.3 vol% DIO additive, the L1-S:IDTP-4F cells gave a PCE of 11.92%, with a Voc of 0.945 V, a Jsc of 18.49 mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.23%. The Voc for the IDTBT-4F cells is ∼0.03 V higher than that of the IDTP-4F cells, consistent with the higher LUMO level of IDTBT-4F. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F cells are shown in Fig. 4b. Although both cells show an EQE of 77% at 696 nm, the latter presents a broader EQE response, leading to a higher photocurrent. The integrated photocurrent densities for IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F cells are 17.73 mA cm−2 and 18.28 mA cm−2, respectively, consistent with the Jsc from J–V measurements. Charge generation and recombination in the solar cells were studied (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†). The photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) plots indicate a higher exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) in IDTP-4F cells, while the Jscversus light intensity (Plight) plots indicate a higher α value in IDTBT-4F cells.23–27 This suggests more efficient charge generation in IDTP-4F cells, and less bimolecular charge recombination in IDTBT-4F cells. The active layer morphology was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 5, the L1-S:IDTBT-4F and L1-S:IDTP-4F blend films display similar morphology. Nanofibers with a diameter of around 20 nm were observed in both films. The root-mean-square roughnesses (Rrms) for the L1-S:IDTBT-4F and L1-S:IDTP-4F films are 1.20 nm and 1.27 nm, respectively. The film morphology is typical in bulk heterojunction solar cells28 and is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport. The TEM images for the L1-S:IDTBT-4F and L1-S:IDTP-4F films are shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†). Typical structures with nanofibers are observed.

Conclusions
We designed two ADA′DA acceptors, IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F, for organic solar cells. The non-fully-fused DA′D core units were prepared via Stille coupling of D and A′ building blocks. The theoretical calculation indicates a banana-shaped configuration and good planarity of the acceptors. PCEs of 12.00% and 11.92% were delivered by the IDTBT-4F and IDTP-4F solar cells, respectively, suggesting the potential of non-fully-fused ADA′DA acceptors.
