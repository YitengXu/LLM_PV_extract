1. Introduction
Since the first proposal of the term “graphene” in 1986,1 numerous theoretical and experimental research studies on graphene and graphene-like materials have been reported. Research activity is obviously accelerated by the fact that the Nobel Prize in physics has been given to Profs. A. K. Geim and K. S. Novoselov for their pioneering studies on graphene in 2010.2 A rapid increase in scientific and technological interest on graphenes causes some confusion on the definition and terminology for graphene-related materials even in scientific journals. A proposal on the nomenclature for two-dimensional carbon materials has recently been presented in the Journal CARBON.3
Hydrogenated, fluorinated and oxidized graphenes are expected to have interesting properties, which are called graphane, fluorographene and graphene oxide, respectively. In addition, the introduction of either acetylenic or diacetylenic chains between carbon hexagons is experimentally shown to give a layer of single-atom thickness, which is flat like graphene and is predicted to have interesting properties like graphene; the former is named graphyne and the latter graphdiyne. Graphyne and graphdiyne cannot be prepared directly from graphene, but they are compared and discussed with graphene with respect to their structure and properties. In this review, therefore, they are classified as graphene derivatives, together with graphane, fluorographene and graphene oxide. Graphene-related nanomaterials, including doped graphene, graphene nanoribbons, porous graphene in addition to five nanomaterials which we classified as graphene derivatives, have been recently reviewed.4 Here, we present the review focusing on the graphene derivatives by emphasizing the experimental results. Graphene is not the theme of this review because many comprehensive reviews have already been published from different viewpoints.5
2. Hydrogenated graphene (graphane)
A fully hydrogenated derivative of graphene, of which the chemical composition is CH, is predicted on the basis of first-principles total energy calculations6 and named graphane.7 It consists of sp3 C–C bonds, as opposed to graphene's sp2 bonds, and consequently a carbon atom layer is puckered. Graphane can have two conformations, as schematically shown on their top-views in Fig. 1: a chair-like conformer with the hydrogen atoms alternating on both sides of the carbon atom layer and a boat-like conformer with the hydrogen atoms alternating in pairs. The space group, bond distances and binding energy predicted6 are shown for two conformers in Table 1. In the chair-type conformer, the calculated C–C bond length of 0.152 nm is similar to that in diamond (sp3 bonding) and is much greater than that in graphene (0.142 nm characteristic for sp2 bonding). In the boat-type conformer, two different C–C bond lengths are expected, 0.152 and 0.156 nm: the former corresponds to two carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms on opposite sides and the latter to those bonded to hydrogen atoms on the same side, slightly longer than 0.152 nm due to H–H repulsion. The calculated binding energy is 6.56 eV per atom for chair-type and 6.50 eV per atom for boat-type, suggesting that the former is favorable. This binding energy calculated for chair-type graphane is even higher than those for other hydrocarbons, such as benzene (6.49 eV per atom) and acetylene (5.90 eV per atom). Therefore, graphane can be considered as an extended two-dimensional hydrocarbon and is the most stable compound with a stoichiometric formula unit CH. Two conformations of graphane are also considered as two-dimensional analogs of diamond, chair-type to cubic diamond and boat-type to the hexagonal one. Similar calculations on graphane have been performed in comparison with fluorographite.8 Calculations using ab initio and classical molecular dynamics methods suggested the presence of the domains with hydrogen frustration (breaking the H atoms in an up and down alternating pattern) in graphane, particularly in the early stages of hydrogenation.9 The stability of three-dimensional crystals built up from two-dimensional graphane sheets under a pressure of up to 300 GPa is explored.10

Graphane was firstly synthesized in 2009 by exposing graphene to cold hydrogen plasma using argon mixed with 10% hydrogen at a low-pressure of 10 Pa and a temperature of 4–160 K.11 Hydrogenation transforms highly conductive zero-overlap semi-metallic graphene into insulating graphane, the reaction being reversible by plasma irradiation and annealing. Graphane and graphenes hydrogenated in various extents are formed by electrolytic hydrogenation of thin graphite flakes in water by applying 10.0 V and 2 × 10−3 A at room temperature.12 In Fig. 2, the Raman spectrum of graphane (fully hydrogenated) is compared with that of the pristine graphene. Marked development of the D-band, broadening of G- and 2D-bands, and appearance of a new band (denoted as E) are characteristic for graphane, the developments of the D-band and E-band being correlated with the hydrogen content. The change in the Raman spectrum with exposing time under radio frequency hydrogen plasma (13.56 MHz, 300 W) in ultrahigh-vacuum is observed on single-layer graphene, as shown in Fig. 3.13 The intensity of the D-band gradually increases and the change seems to be saturated after 50 s exposure. Exfoliation of graphite oxide under high hydrogen pressure (6–15 MPa and 200–500 °C) gave partially hydrogenated graphenes.14,15 It was theoretically shown that hydrogen atoms on one side of graphane can be unloaded by applying an external electric field, where the hydrogen atoms on the other side are retained and the unpaired electrons in the unsaturated C sites give rise to magnetic moments.16 Hydrogen treatment at a higher temperature and pressure (400–550 °C and 5 MPa) results in the partial hydrogenation of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), some being unzipped into partially hydrogenated graphene nanoribbons at 550 °C.17

Opening of the band gap of graphene with hydrogenation was studied on a sheet grown on the (111) surface of Ir crystals, suggesting a possibility to tune the band gap by partial hydrogenation.18 The band gap increases gradually with the increasing hydrogenation degree, reaching 0.77 eV when 54% of the carbon atoms are bonded to hydrogen to form graphane-like islands. The electronic properties of graphene sheets and nanoribbons hydrogenated in different degrees under hydrogen plasma have been studied.13 The marked effect of hydrogenation is observed on the dependence of resistance R on the back-gate voltage Vbg for graphene nanoribbons, as shown in Fig. 4. The maximum value of R increases rapidly with increasing exposure time, i.e., the increasing hydrogenation degree, together with the increase in Vbg appearing R maximum. The rapid decrease in the mobility of carriers is also observed with hydrogenation.

Interesting properties have been predicted by theoretical calculations for graphane and partially hydrogenated graphenes. In graphane the thermal energy can be accommodated by in-plane bending modes, involving C–C–C bond angles in the puckered carbon layer, in contrast to significant out-of-plane fluctuation modes in graphene.19 Thermal properties of graphane up to 1500 K were predicted using simulation, heat capacity being 29.32 J mol−1 K−1, a little larger than graphene.20 Graphane has a lower hydrophobicity compared to graphene.21 The minimum band gap is 5.4 eV in the stable chair-type conformation, and 4.9 eV in the metastable boat-type conformation.22 The gradual increase in the band-gap with hydrogenation was theoretically predicted, from 0 eV for graphene to 4.4 eV for graphane (fully hydrogenated).11 The electronic and magnetic properties were discussed on the basis of theoretical calculations for graphane nanoribbons.23 Hydrogenation from graphene to fully hydrogenated graphane was predicted to cause the change in electronic and magnetic properties from metallic to semiconducting and from nonmagnetic to magnetic.24 H-vacancy defects induced on one side of the graphane are found to be the source of ferromagnetism even at room temperature.25 For the nanoribbons having the zigzag interfaces between graphene and graphane domains, it is predicted that the nanoribbon behaves antiferromagnetic when interfaces are fully hydrogenated, and ferromagnetic when half hydrogenated.26 Graphane doped by alkali–metal atoms at a low concentration of 3.125% shows semiconductor behavior, whereas at a high concentration the doped graphane shows metallic behavior, in contrast to the prediction that graphane doped by alkaline-earth metals exhibits metallic behavior at all doping concentrations.27 The optical properties of graphane are dominated by localized charge-transfer excitations governed by enhanced electron correlations in a two-dimensional dielectric medium.28 Substitution of B, N, P, and Al atoms for carbon atoms in graphane can cause the transition from semiconductor to metal.29 Li-doped graphane can achieve a hydrogen storage capacity of 3.2–3.8 mass%.30,31
Theoretical consideration was also applied on graphane nanotubes32 and nanoribbons.33 The armchair type nanotube from chair-type graphane, shown in Fig. 5, was the most stable configuration among the nanotube structures considered, even at elevated temperatures.32 The calculated band gaps of graphane nanotubes depended on both the diameter and hydrogenation degree of the nanotube, suggesting insulating behaviors of nanotubes.

3. Fluorinated graphene (fluorographene)
The reaction of graphite with fluorine has been studied already in 1934.34,35 The structure and chemical composition of graphite fluorides represented by (CF)n and (C2F)n are well understood, and definite applications as the anode material of lithium primary batteries and the super-hydrophobic material.36 In graphite fluorides with the composition CF and C2F, the graphite layers are no longer flat but puckered in chair-type. In C2F, half of the carbon atoms form the covalent bond with fluorine and the other half are also covalently bonded with carbon atoms in neighbouring layers.
Fluorinated graphene (fluorographene), monolayer of graphite fluoride, is another important structural derivative of graphene. Structure of fully fluorinated graphene has a chair-type conformation, similar to graphane. The boat-type conformation is supposed to be difficult to be formed in fluorographene, because fluorine atoms alternating on one side of the carbon atom layer in pairs give strong repulsion. Fluorographene has been synthesized by reacting graphene with either XeF2 (ref. 37–39) and CF4 (ref. 40) at room temperature, and by mechanical and chemical exfoliation of graphite fluoride.41,42 The methods announced for the synthesis in the large-scale process with a low cost and less toxicity have also been proposed; the sonochemical exfoliation process of graphite fluoride in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) at room temperature43 and reaction of graphene oxide with HF under hydrothermal conditions with ultrasonication.44
Fluorographene synthesized by heating graphene in XeF2 gas at 250 °C has a band gap of 3.8 eV, close to that calculated, and cannot be suspended in ethanol, although the pristine graphene can be suspended by sonication for 30 s, as shown in Fig. 6.39 It luminesces in the UV and visible light regions, and resembles diamond in its optical properties, with both excitonic, and direct optical absorption and emission features. Fluorographene, which is prepared by the reaction of graphene with XeF2 gas at 70 °C, is a high-quality insulator (resistivity of higher than 1012 Ω) with an optical gap of 3 eV, exhibits a Young's modulus of 100 N m−1, and is stable up to 400 °C even in air, similar to Teflon.37 By exposure of one side of graphene to XeF2 gas, fluorination was saturated at 25% coverage (composition of C4F), although full coverage (CF) was attained by exposure of both sides.38 In Fig. 7, Raman spectra are shown for partially fluorinated graphene prepared by exposing to CF4 plasma at room temperature and de-fluorinated graphene at 365 °C in Ar + H2 gas, revealing the marked change in D- and 2D-bands by fluorination and de-fluorination.40 Dilute fluorination of graphene results in a temperature dependence as the insulator and the resistance at the charge neutrality point increases by three orders of magnitude from 25 kΩ at 200 K to 2.5 MΩ at 5 K, although pristine graphene is highly conductive with a weak temperature dependence of resistance. Fluorographene was obtained as the supernatant by exfoliation of graphite fluoride in sulfolane under sonication at 50 °C for 1 h, consisting of single-layer fluorographene with the thickness of less than 0.9 nm in a significant fraction, together with multilayered sheets of about 2–4 nm thickness.41 Its de-fluorination was possible in sulfolane solution of KI by heating under stirring at 240 °C for 2 h, the process being supposed to proceed via the formation of metastable graphene iodide. Comparative quantum mechanical calculations reveal that fluorographene is the most thermodynamically stable of five hypothetical graphene derivatives; graphane, graphene fluoride, bromide, chloride, and iodide.

Theoretical predictions of the properties of fluorographene by comparing with graphane, because of their similar bonding states and their applications, have been published.45–51 Fluorographene exhibits much lower friction than graphane, as shown by plotting energy corrugation with displacement in Fig. 8, because of the low interlayer interaction induced by the repulsive electrostatic forces between F.50 Doping of fluorographene with K, Li, Au and C12N4F4 is studied by density functional theory (DFT), showing that the former two act as an electron donor (n-type doping) but the latter two suggest difficulty of p-type doping in fluorographene.46 Doping of boron substituting carbon atoms in fluorographene seems to occur easily and create a shallow acceptor level, while nitrogen act as deep donors in a chemically unstable system.49 The process of fluorination of graphene in fluorine and also in mixed gases of fluorine with hydrogen is theoretically studied.47 Fluorination tends to produce defective areas on graphene, being associated with large holes, due to significant distortion of carbon–carbon bonds.51 The presence of a small amount of hydrogen in fluorine gas causes a significant decrease in the rate of fluorination, while hydrogen incorporation into graphene is accelerated by the presence of a small amount of fluorine in hydrogen gas. Formation of new hybrid structures containing hydrogen and fluorine with different stable configurations (chair-, zigzag- and boat-types) are predicted, as shown in Fig. 9.

Partially fluorinated graphenes were obtained by exfoliation of graphite fluorides with F/C ratios of 0.25 and 0.5 in an ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide) under ultrasonication.42 DFT calculation showed that the band gap of fluorinated graphene depends sensitively on the coverage and configuration of fluorine atoms. Fluorination of SWCNTs was successfully performed in F2/He gas at a temperature below 325 °C by keeping tube-like morphology with a composition close to C2F,52 suggesting almost complete coverage of the outer surface of nanotubes by fluorine. A very low friction coefficient was confirmed on fluorinated SWCNTs.53
4. Oxidized graphene (graphene oxide)
In most cases, graphite oxide was synthesized using the process proposed by Hummers and Offeman54 which was derived from the method of Staudenmaire,55 often called the Hummers method. Its principal steps are the oxidation of graphite in concentrated H2SO4 with NaNO3 and KMnO4, the exclusion of excess KMnO4 by reducing to water-soluble MnSO4 with H2O2 and then washing by methanol. In some attempts the Brodie method56 was used, where the oxidation of graphite was carried out in fuming HNO3 with KClO3. To synthesize graphite oxide, the electrochemical oxidation of graphite can be applied in either H2SO4 or HNO3 (ref. 57 and 58) and also in an ammonia solution.59 The improved method by using the H2SO4–H3PO4 mixture was recently proposed, saying the advantages of high yield of graphite oxide, easiness of reaction temperature control and no generation of toxic gases.60 The formation process of graphite oxide from graphite was discussed by dividing into three steps, conversion to intercalation compounds, oxidation by inserting the oxidizing agent into the preoccupied graphite galleries, and exposure to water resulting in loosing c-axis order.61 The second step is an entirely diffusion-controlled process, consequently rate-determining. Graphite oxide contains oxygen and hydroxide radicals in various amounts making covalent bonds with carbon and, as a consequence, a layer of carbon atoms is not flat. Graphite oxides synthesized can have a wide range of chemical compositions, such as C8O3.5–4.3H2.5–2.9 (Ref. 62), C8O3.78–5.05H2.9–4.4 (Ref. 63), C8O2.54H3.91 and C8O4.61H6.70 (Ref. 64) depending strongly on the starting graphite and the synthesis conditions, and also containing different kinds of oxygen species and bonds to carbon, such as epoxy, hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxylic groups. On graphite oxides synthesized from flaky graphite via the Brodie method, marked color change from grey to gold was observed, probably because of the change in oxygen-containing radicals, but no marked changes in the bulk chemical composition and interlayer spacing with repetition of the oxidation process.65 Structure models proposed by different authors are shown in Fig. 10. Graphite oxide has been used as the host material for intercalation compounds with different linear organic compounds.66–70 Various trimethylammonium cations can be intercalated into the gallery of graphite oxide with different orientations of long linear molecules.67

Graphene oxide is a single layer sheet of graphite oxide. In recent years, it has attracted great concern mainly because it is a potential starting material for the mass production of graphene.5 Chemistry of graphene oxide has been reviewed.71
Graphene oxide can be a semiconductor or an insulator, depending on the degree of oxidation, and their electronic and optical properties can be tuned in a wide range. The controllable optical and electronic properties enable graphene oxides to be used in many fields. The major concern about graphene oxide is mainly focused on its chemical structure, electronic properties, reduction reaction and chemical functionalization.
Graphene films grown epitaxially on the C-terminated surface of a SiC wafer were converted to multilayer graphene oxide via the Hummers method, of which stability with aging time at room temperature was studied from the measurement of the XPS spectrum.72 As-prepared graphene oxide is metastable, of which the contents of oxygen and graphene oxide decrease gradually even after 1 month, and then the change tends to be saturated. Atomic and electronic structures of graphene oxide were studied by TEM, AFM and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).73 In Fig. 11, the AFM image of graphene oxide prepared by oxidation (Hummers method) of graphene (Fig. 11a) and its depth intensity histograms (Fig. 11b), showing that the particles consist of mono-, bi- and tri-layers are easily observed. In (Fig. 11c), the EELS spectrum, which is a direct measure of the dielectric response of the film to the external electromagnetic excitation, is shown for a mono-layer graphene oxide compared with graphite and amorphous carbon. The peak for bulk plasma-loss (combination of π* and σ* electronic excitations) occurs at 24–27 eV for graphite and amorphous carbon, but that for graphene oxide does much lower at 19 eV. The low-energy plasma excitations of the π* electrons, however, occur at around 5 eV for graphene oxide, similar for graphite and amorphous carbon. Graphene oxide is rough, with an average surface roughness of 0.6 nm, and the structure is predominantly amorphous due to distortions from sp3 C–O bonds. Around 40% sp3 bonding was found to be present in these sheets with an O–C ratio of 1/5.

Many studies have been devoted to prepare graphene oxide sheets having a well-controlled thickness and area, and to their reduction to fabricate graphene sheets.74–81 In the presence of poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate), graphite oxide can undergo complete exfoliation in water, yielding colloidal suspensions of almost entirely individual graphene oxide sheets.82 By filtration of this colloidal suspension through a membrane filter, followed by air drying, a graphene oxide film was prepared.74 The thickness of the film was controlled by adjusting the volume of the colloid. The graphene oxide hydrosol prepared from natural graphite flakes by oxidation was heated at 60 °C for a short period in a water bath to obtain the film on the surface of the aqueous dispersion (on air/water interface), which was collected on a PET substrate by dip coating.80 To prepare transparent conductive films of graphene oxide, the films were dipped in a HI aqueous solution (55%) at 100 °C for 30 s, and then washed repeatedly with ethanol to remove the residual HI. Transparent sheets with a large area up to 4 × 104 μm2 were successfully prepared. The films after the reduction in HI solution showed a sheet resistance of 840 Ω sq−1 by maintaining 78% transparency. Transparent graphene oxide films before and after the reduction in HI aqueous solution are shown in Fig. 12. Reduction of graphene oxide sheets by maintaining their structure and texture was reviewed by focusing on the preparation of graphene.81 The electronic properties of graphene oxide mainly depend on the oxidation level and chemical composition; it can be tailored by the removal or addition of certain oxygen groups to adjust the proportion of sp2 and sp3 carbon.83,84

Mechanical properties of graphene oxide were measured on the films prepared by filtration.74 The stress–strain curve for graphene oxide is divided into three regions, I to III, as shown in Fig. 13a. The region I is due to straightening of the component graphene oxide sheets and shows a residual strain after unloading, as shown in Fig. 13b, which decreases with increasing temperature, supposing to be due to the decrease in the water content in the film. The region II is due to elastic deformation and the region III to plastic deformation of the film. The modulus of the film was measured as 32 GPa, increasing slightly with decreasing water content.

Graphene oxide has attracted increasing interest for drug delivery and other biomedical applications due to its good biocompatibility, ultrahigh drug loading capability, and the ease of surface functionalization.85–88 Nano-sized particles of graphene oxide show superior gene transfection efficiency without serum interference, as well as reduced cytotoxicity, after being physiologically stable dual-polymer-functionalized by using polyethylene glycol and polyethylenimine.85,86 Graphene oxide decorated by both iron oxide and gold nanoparticles was coated by polyethylene glycol, obtaining an enhanced photothermal cancer ablation effect with high stability in physiological environments and no significant in vitro toxicity.87 Its performance was tested in both in vitro cell tests and in vivo animal experiments. Graphene oxide has been pointed out to have distinct advantages as a biosensing platform due to its excellent capabilities for coupling with biomolecules and processing in solution.89 Biomedical applications for drug delivery, cancer therapies and biomedical imaging were reviewed on graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide, the behaviours and toxicology of functionalized graphene oxide being discussed.88 The fact that graphene oxide can contain a large amount of functional groups causes the difficulty for its exact characterization, but it can be an advantage in some applications, particularly in the biomedical applications, because its functionalities are easily modified to improve in an aqueous solution, for example, and new functionalities are expected to be easily created.
5. Graphyne and graphdiyne
Instead of a flat single carbon layer consisting of hexagons (i.e., graphene), as occurred in nature like graphite, a flat single atomic layer of carbon is possible by connecting carbon hexagons by linear carbon chains. The graphyne structure, in which carbon hexagons are bonded by a linear acetylenic chain, has been predicted in 1987,90 one year later than the proposal of the definition of “graphene”.1 Later, graphdiyne which consists of two acetylenic chains in between carbon hexagons has been proposed.91 The structures of these two are shown in Fig. 14, by comparing with graphene. The name “graphyne” comes from its chemical structure, one-third of the carbon–carbon bonds in graphene being replaced by acetylenic linkages, and “graphdiyne” from the presence of two acetylenic (di-acetylenic) linkages. The linear carbon chain between carbon hexagons is shown to be more stable to be composed of acetylenic linkages (–CC–) than cumulative linkages (CC).92
 Fig. 14  Structure of graphene (a), graphyne (b) and graphdiyne (c). The parallelogram drawn with a red line represents a unit cell. 
Various arrangements of acetylenic linkages to form a flat layer of carbon atoms have been theoretically discussed and reviewed.93,94 The two-dimensional arrangements with or without carbon aromatic hexagon, such as Fig. 15a–c, and also numbers of linkages in between two hexagons, as Fig. 15d, are discussed. The binding energy and lattice parameter are 7.95 eV per atom and 0.686 nm for graphyne and 7.78 eV per atom and 0.944 nm for graphdiyne, respectively. Both graphyne and graphdiyne are semiconductive with band gaps of about 0.5–0.6 eV and considerably small effective masses for carriers.92 The band gap for the graphdiyne film is predicted theoretically to be 0.46 eV and its in-plane intrinsic electron mobility can be in the order of 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature, while the hole mobility is about an order of magnitude lower.95 Graphyne was predicted to have a Poisson's ratio of 0.417 and an in-plane stiffness of 1036 eV nm−2 being much softer than graphene,96 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.429 and an in-plane Young's modulus of 162 N m−1.97 Stacking order of two-dimensional graphdiyne layers was theoretically discussed in the bulk.98 Thermal conductivity of graphyne was calculated to be much smaller than graphene by assuming different numbers of acetylenic linkage.99 Mechanical properties of graphyne-like layers, including graphdiyne, were discussed as a function of number of acetylenic linkages100,101 and of different arrangements of acetylenic linkages.102 The modulus of graphyne-like layers with a zigzag structure is plotted against the number of acetylenc linkages in Fig. 16.101 For graphdiyne, the modulus and ultimate strength were calculated as 470–580 GPa and 36–46 GPa, respectively.

Substructures of graphyne and graphdiyne have been synthesized.91,103–110 The graphdiyne film with a large area (∼3.6 cm2) has been successfully prepared via cross-coupling reaction of the monomer of hexaethynylbenzene at 60 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere on the copper surface, as shown by TEM images and the XRD pattern in Fig. 17.111 The resultant film shows a clear lattice fringe image (Fig. 17b) with a spotty selected-area electron diffraction pattern (Fig. 17c) and semiconducting properties. Its XRD pattern gives sharp diffraction peaks (Fig. 17d), the interlayer spacing 0.419 nm calculated from the peak at 2θ of 21.18° being the same as calculated from the lattice fringe image (Fig. 17b). Graphdiyne is synthesized as a nanotube array by using the anodic aluminum oxide film template with a channel diameter of 200 nm and Cu catalyst, the nanotubes having the length of about 40 μm and the wall thickness of about 40 nm.112 By annealing at 650 °C, graphdiyne nanotubes shrank to the wall thickness of 15 nm, without noticeable change in the length, SEM and TEM images of the nanotube array being shown in Fig. 18. The annealed graphdiyne nanotube array shows high performance in field emission, as shown in Fig. 19 when compared to nanotubes before annealing and films.105 Loading of photocatalytic TiO2 nanoparticles on graphdiyne nanosheets is shown to be effective to improve photoactivity, a little better than that on graphene.113,114 The cross-coupling reaction of hexaethynylbenzene was applied to synthesize nanowires of graphdiyne using ZnO nanorod arrays on a silicon substrate, the resultant nanowires had a conductivity of 1.9 × 103 S m−1 and a mobility of 7.1 × 102 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature.115 The polymer solar cell with the addition of 2.5 mass% graphdiyne exhibited an enhanced short circuit current of 2.4 mA cm−2 and the highest power conversion efficiency of 3.52%, which is 56% higher than that of the cell without graphdiyne addition, probably due to the high charge transport capability of graphdiyne and the formation of efficient percolation paths in the active layer.116

Theoretical consideration focusing on the properties related to the possible applications of graphyne and graphdiyne has been reported. In contrast to graphite where Li diffusion is confined in the interlayer space (in-plane diffusion), graphyne and graphdiyne can give a possibility for both in-plane and out-plane diffusion of Li ions, as illustrated on graphyne in Fig. 20, owing to the unique atomic arrangement and electronic structures.117 Diffusion barriers calculated for two diffusion pathways are moderate, as 0.35–0.57 eV, and the maximum Li intercalation density can be LiC4 in graphyne,117 and LiC3 in graphdiyne,118 exceeding the limit of LiC6 in graphite. Electronic properties of graphyne and graphdiyne nanoribbons with armchair and zigzag edges were discussed as a function of the ribbon width.119,120 The band gap of these ribbons decreases with the increasing ribbon width. Advantages of building p–n junctions based on graphyne were discussed.121 The phonon thermal conductance of graphyne is much reduced, 46% of graphene at room temperature, while it is larger than that of graphene at low temperatures because of the softer flexural phonon modes in graphyne.122 Due to the semiconductor property of graphyne, thermoelectric power was expected to be one magnitude larger than that of graphene. Thermal conductance showed a linear dependence on the width of armchair-edged graphyne nanoribbons, while step-like width dependence was displayed in the conductance of zigzag-edged nanoribbons.123

The first-principles density functional calculations predicted that Ca-decorated graphyne can have high hydrogen-storage capacity as 6–8 mass% at 25 °C under 3 MPa.124–126 Ca atoms are supposed to be highly dispersed on the surface of graphyne, although they tend to form clusters on the surface of graphene and fullerene. More hydrogen-storage capacity was predicted for Li-decorated graphyne, 9.26 mass% for single-side decorated and 15.15 mass% for both side decorated.127 The decoration effect of 3d transition metals (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) on electronic and magnetic properties of graphdiyne and graphyne was studied.128 Graphdiyne can serve as a separation membrane for H2 purification from CH4 and CO.129
6. Concluding remarks
The present authors have proposed to classify the carbon materials on the basis of chemical bonds between carbon atoms, sp3, flat sp2, curved sp2 and sp1 hybrid systems, and are called diamond, graphite, fullerene and carbyne families, respectively.130,131 The graphite family involves a number of carbon materials, from classic carbons (represented by synthetic graphites, carbon blacks and activated carbons) and new carbons (represented by various carbon fibers, pyrolytic carbons, isotropic high-density graphites, etc.) to nanocarbons (represented by carbon nanotubes and graphenes). However, the development of graphyne and graphdiyne suggests us a new carbon family composed of two kinds of C–C bonds, sp2 and sp1. In addition, graphane, fluorographene and graphene oxide have to be included as new members of the sp3 system. These carbon materials described in the present review can be derived by chemical reactions or theoretical considerations from graphene, as illustrated in Fig. 21. In the figure, fullerene and SWCNT, together with graphite and amorphous carbon, are included because all of them can also be derived from graphene.
 Fig. 21  Graphene derivatives. 
The chemical composition of graphane is CH, which may be considered as one of the organic compounds with an extremely large size, and may be a giant hydrocarbon. Organic compounds, such as aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons including their mixtures like pitches, are important precursors for all carbon materials. However, in the development of graphene derivatives, as explained in the present review, graphene may be able to be used as an important starting material for giant organic compounds by introducing hydrogen as graphane and acetylenic linkages as graphyne and graphdiyne. The discovery of graphane and fluorographene may open the floodgates for new graphene-based nano-sized electronic elements, such as possible control on the band-gap from zero-band-gap graphene to wide-band-gap graphane and fluorographene by partial hydrogenation and fluorination, nanoribbons with metallic graphene at one end and insulating graphane or fluorographene at the other end, graphane substituted foreign atoms, etc. Nanotubes of graphane and fluorographene are one-dimensional nanomaterials as predicted by theoretical consideration. The establishment in large-scale production processes for these materials in different morphologies, nanoflakes, nanoribbons and nanotubes is strongly demanded.
In addition to the derivatives reviewed here, porous graphene attracts attention because of its properties theoretically expected; extremely high selectivity on the order of 1023 for H2/CH4 on a pore width of 0.25 nm,132 remarkably high selectivity for H2/CO2, CO and CH4, and semiconductive behavior on a postulated two-dimensional polyphenylene network,133 a large band gap of 3.2 eV, similar to photoactive TiO2 and low energy for hydrogen adsorption after Li-decoration on a two-dimensional polyphenylene network,134 and separating He from the other noble gases and alkanes present in natural gas.135 However, porous graphene, which was practically synthesized from hexaiodo-substituted macrocycle cyclohexa-m-phenylene by silver-promoted aryl–aryl coupling, contains various sizes of pores.136 Therefore, it is better to say heavily defective graphene, although it can be the first step for the synthesis of porous graphene with controlled pores.
