    , Accepted 15th January 2016First published on 18th January 2016AbstractThieno[3,4-b]pyrazine based organic sensitizers with cyanoacrylic acid (FNE64 and FNE66) or carboxylic acid (FNE65 and FNE67) as anchoring groups have been designed and synthesized to optimize the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of panchromatic sensitizer FNE32 with an identical auxiliary electron acceptor. Their absorption, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties are systematically investigated. It is found that sensitizers FNE65 and FNE67 with carboxylic acid as the anchoring group possess more negative LUMO levels as compared with sensitizers FNE64 and FNE66 with cyanoacrylic acid as the anchoring group. In addition to tuning the LUMO level of thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine based organic sensitizer FNE32 by attaching different anchoring groups, the number of the bridged benzene ring has been optimized and two types of organic sensitizers with D–A–π–A (FNE64 and FNE65) and D–π–A–π–A (FNE66 and FNE67) frameworks have been comparatively investigated. Upon the incorporation of an additional phenylene unit into sensitizers FNE64 and FNE65 with the D–A–π–A configuration, sensitizers FNE66 and FNE67 with the D–π–A–π–A structure exhibit unusual hypsochromically shifted absorption maxima. Moreover, the LUMO levels of the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine based sensitizers FNE66 and FNE67 are lifted up, which results in a dramatically improved driving force for the electron injection from the excited dye molecules to the conduction band of the titania semiconductor. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency of the quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) based on FNE66 increases by 95% in comparison to that for the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on panchromatic sensitizer FNE32 whose photo-response range is over 900 nm. Our findings will facilitate the understanding of the crucial importance of energy level engineering and present a way for tuning the LUMO levels of organic sensitizers at a fixed electron acceptor.
Introduction
Since the pioneering work of O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991,1 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been investigated extensively as potential candidates for renewable energy systems. The past decade has witnessed a steady increase of power conversion efficiency (η) for metal sensitizer based DSSCs.2 Among these sensitizers, zinc porphyrin sensitizer SM315 has reaped a η record of 13% without the assistance of any co-sensitizer.3 Concerning the cost and environmental issues of metal-based sensitizers, many research groups have focused on metal-free organic sensitizers owing to their unique advantages, such as high molar extinction coefficients, low synthetic and purification cost, tunable photophysical properties via molecular engineering, and essentially no resource limitation.4 Nevertheless, despite these attractions, the performance of DSSCs based on metal-free organic dyes has lagged behind those of traditional metal-based organic dyes.5 Encouragingly, a pure organic dye based DSSC has recently achieved an efficiency of 12.5%6 under the illumination of simulated AM1.5G solar light at one sun. However, most highly efficient DSSCs have been realized employing volatile organic liquid electrolytes which have suffered from leakage problems, limiting their outdoor applications. Alternatively, non-volatile ionic liquids or non-flowing (quasi-)solid-state electrolytes have been utilized in DSSCs to overcome such shortcomings.7 Although significantly improved long-term stability has been achieved for these DSSCs based on non-liquid electrolytes, highly efficient and stable DSSCs are still pursued for their outdoor applications.
In a typical DSSC, the photocurrent is basically determined by the light harvesting efficiency of the dye molecules. Therefore, great efforts have been focused on developing novel organic sensitizers with reduced energy gaps by either raising the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) or lowering the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the organic sensitizer, or both.8 Meanwhile, suitable HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the sensitizer are required to match the iodide/triiodide redox potential and the conduction band edge of the TiO2 semiconductor to ensure efficient dye regeneration and electron injection from the excited dye molecules into the TiO2 conduction band. Consequently, a balance between the wide absorption spectrum and suitable energy level is of great importance to construct ideal sensitizers for DSSCs.
Thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine, a strong electron-deficient group, has been extensively studied as a unique electron acceptor and engaged into donor-acceptor low band gap polymers for organic photovoltaics (OPVs).9 Recently, we have incorporated thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine as an auxiliary acceptor group into D–π–A featured organic sensitizers and constructed panchromatic sensitizer FNE3210 (Fig. 1) whose maximum absorption band is located at around 600 nm. However, although the corresponding DSSC exhibited very broad IPCE spectra over the whole visible range extending into the near infrared (NIR) region up to 900 nm, the η value was limited to only 3.7% due to the insufficient driving force for the electron injection from the excited organic dyes into the TiO2 film. Therefore, further molecular optimization is needed to tune the energy levels of the organic sensitizers for improving the DSSC performance.

In D–π–A–π–A featured organic sensitizers, it has been well established that the LUMO levels can be finely tuned by structural modification of the inserted auxiliary acceptor.11 However, few studies have been carried out to optimize the LUMO levels by adjusting other building blocks in the D–π–A–π–A framework at a fixed auxiliary acceptor.12 Herein, the π-conjugated spacers and the anchoring groups are adjusted to lift up the LUMO levels of thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine based organic sensitizers. The bridged thiophene ring in sensitizer FNE32 is replaced by the benzene ring and two types of organic sensitizers with D–A–π–A (FNE64 and FNE65) and D–π–A–π–A (FNE66 and FNE67) frameworks have been constructed, as shown in Fig. 1. Although incorporation of a benzene ring13 can generally extend the π-conjugation and bathochromically shift the maximum absorption wavelength of organic semiconductors, it is found that the D–π–A–π–A configuration is superior to the D–A–π–A configuration in increasing the energy band gap and lifting up the LUMO levels. Moreover, a much weaker electron withdrawing group, carboxylic acid, is introduced as the anchoring group instead of the traditional cyanoacrylic acid group, which successfully raises the LUMO levels, enhancing the electron injection driving force in the related DSSCs. As a result, the η value of the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on FNE66 increases by 95% in comparison to that of the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on FNE32 with the same electron acceptor.

Under a nitrogen atmosphere, a mixture of compound 4b (70 mg, 0.12 mmol) and LiOH (10 mg, 0.42 mmol) in a mixed solution of 10 mL THF, 3 mL methanol, and 3 mL water was refluxed in the presence of tetrabutylammonium iodide (20 mg, 0.05 mmol) for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was removed with a rotary evaporator and the residue was dissolved in water. The aqueous portion was acidified to pH = 2 with hydrochloric acid and extracted with CH2Cl2. The combined CH2Cl2 extracts were dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was removed with a rotary evaporator, and the crude product was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel, DCM/methanol = 10/1, v/v). A purple solid was obtained with a yield of 66% (60 mg). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO, δ ppm): 8.60 (s, 1H), 8.53 (s, 1H), 8.23 (d, 2H, J = 8.4 Hz), 7.98 (d, 2H, J = 8.4 Hz), 7.91 (d, 2H, J = 8.7 Hz), 6.99 (d, 4H, J = 8.7 Hz), 6.84 (d, 4H, J = 8.8 Hz), 6.77 (d, 4H, J = 8.7 Hz), 3.86 (t, 4H, J = 6.3 Hz), 1.58–1.70 (m, 2H), 1.14–1.28 (m, 20H), 0.81 (t, 6H, J = 6.0 Hz). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3, δ ppm): 171.2, 156.2, 149.4, 144.8, 143.8, 141.5, 140.2, 139.8, 138.6, 136.1, 130.9, 129.2, 127.8, 127.4, 119.9, 115.6, 68.5, 32.1, 29.6, 29.5, 26.3, 22.9, 14.4.

Characterization

1H NMR (400 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz) spectra were measured on a Varian Mercury Plus-400 spectrometer. The splitting patterns are designated as follows: s (singlet); d (doublet); t (triplet); and m (multiplet). The UV-vis absorption spectra of the sensitizers in dilute toluene solutions and on TiO2 films were measured with a Shimadzu UV-2550PC UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The film thickness was measured by using a surface profiler (Veeco Dektak 150, USA). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) were determined with an CHI660E electrochemical workstation using a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell with a dye adsorbed TiO2 film on conductive glass as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode, and 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) was used as the supporting electrolyte in water-free acetonitrile. The potential of the reference electrode was calibrated by ferrocene, and all potentials mentioned in this work are against the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).
DSSC fabrication and photovoltaic performance measurements
TiO2 films were fabricated by a screen printing on a conducting glass substrate. The films were sintered at 500 °C for 2 h to achieve good necking of neighboring TiO2 particles. The sintered films were further treated with 0.05 M TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min, then washed with water, and annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. When cooled down at around 120 °C, the TiO2 electrodes were dipped in the solution of dye with 0.3 mM concentration in toluene/EtOH (v/v, 7/3) for 24 h at room temperature for complete dye adsorption. TiO2 on conductive glass as the working electrode and Pt-coated conductive glass as the counter electrode were assembled into a sealed sandwich solar cell with a thermoplastic frame (Surlyn, 30 μm thick). A quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte was prepared by mixing 5 wt% poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF–HFP) with a redox solution containing 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, 0/0.1/0.2/0.3/0.4/0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) under heating at 100 °C until all solids were dissolved. After introducing the hot gel solution into the internal space of the cell from the two holes predrilled on the back of the counter electrode, a uniform motionless polymer gel layer was formed between the working and the counter electrodes, and then the holes were sealed with a Surlyn film covered with a thin glass slide under heat. The quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the resulting sensitizers (0.3 mM) with coadsorption of deoxycholic acid were constructed according to our previously reported method.4c The active area is 0.25 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured by recording J–V curves using a Keithley 2420 source meter under the illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light coming from a solar simulator (Sol3A equipped with a 450 W Xe lamp and an AM1.5G filter, Newport). The light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell (Newport 91150). The electron lifetimes were measured with intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), whereas charge densities at open-circuit were measured using the charge extraction technique. IMVS analysis and charge extraction were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner XPOT, Germany), which includes a white light emitting diode and corresponding control system. The intensity modulated spectra were measured at room temperature with light intensity ranging from 20 to 120 W m−2, in modulation frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz, and with modulation amplitude less than 5% of the light intensity. Action spectra of the incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the solar cells were recorded using an SM-250 system (Bunkoh-Keiki, Japan). The intensity of monochromatic light was measured with a Si detector (S1337-1010BQ).
Results and discussion
Synthesis of sensitizers
The approach towards sensitizers FNE64–FNE67 is depicted in Scheme 1. The synthesis of the four target sensitizers started from 2,5-dibromothieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (1)14 which was firstly converted to compound 3a and 3b by an asymmetrical Suzuki coupling15 with 4-formylbenzeneboronic acid (2a) and 4-methoxycarbonylbenzeneboronic acid (2b), respectively. Via a further Suzuki coupling with N,N-bis[4-(octyloxy)phenyl]-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)aniline, an electron donating group was introduced and precursors 4a and 4b were provided. Compared with reference FNE32, octyloxy substituted triarylamine was incorporated as the electron donor instead of triphenylamine due to its unique merits, such as stronger electron donating capability, endowing sensitizers sufficient solubility, and suppressing intermolecular aggregation on TiO2 films and thus retarding charge recombination in DSSCs. On the other hand, a Suzuki coupling between the intermediate compound 3a/3b and 4-trimethylsilylphenylboronic acid produced TMS-protected compounds 5a and 5b, respectively, which were further transferred to iodides 6a and 6b by the reaction with ICl.16 Similarly, an electron donating group was incorporated via a Suzuki coupling, which provides precursors 7a and 7b. Afterwards, precursors 4a and 7a were converted to sensitizers FNE64 and FNE66 by Knoevenagel condensation17 with cyanoacetic acid through refluxing acetonitrile in the presence of piperidine, while sensitizers FNE65 and FNE67 were obtained by de-esterification from precursors 4b and 7b through refluxing with LiOH.18 All the target dye sensitizers were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS spectroscopies, and were found to be consistent with the proposed structures.

Photophysical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the four sensitizers in dilute toluene solutions (ca. 10−5 M) are depicted in Fig. 2 and the corresponding photophysical data are summarized in Table 1. Similar to reference FNE32, all the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine based sensitizers exhibit their major electronic absorption bands in the visible region due to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the electron donating moiety to the electron accepting moiety.19 Additionally, another absorption band can be observed for all dyes in the ultraviolet region, which is assigned to the π–π* electron transition of the conjugated backbone. Compared with the maximum absorption band of FNE32,10 the absorption spectra of sensitizer FNE64 display the maximum absorption wavelength at 572 nm with a hypsochromic shift of 24 nm, which is obviously due to the shortened effective conjugation length. When the cyanoacetic acid in FNE64 is replaced by the carboxylic acid group, a much weaker electron acceptor, FNE65 demonstrates the maximum absorption wavelength at 549 nm with a hypsochromic shift of 23 nm as compared with FNE64, due to the much weaker electron-withdrawing property of carboxylic acid in comparison to cyanoacrylic acid which results in the weakened ICT interactions and higher energy absorption. Moreover, when an auxiliary benzene ring is inserted between the triarylamine and thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine unit in FNE64, sensitizer FNE66 displays the absorption maximum wavelength at 525 nm with a more significant hypsochromic shift of 47 nm and increased molar extinction coefficient in comparison to that of sensitizer FNE64. In general, extending the conjugation by inserting a benzene ring can bathochromically shift the maximum absorption wavelength. However, in comparison to sensitizer FNE64, a significant hypsochromic shift of 47 nm is observed for the absorption maximum of sensitizer FNE66. Similar phenomena13 have been previously reported and can be explained by the following two factors. The first is the steric hindrance between the benzene ring and neighboring functional groups, which induces a more twisted molecular skeleton in sensitizer FNE66 as compared with FNE64. Another reason is the enhanced distance between the electron donor and acceptor, which probably weakens the ICT interactions and results in the hypsochromically shifted absorption maximum. It should be noted that a hypsochromic shift of 71 nm can be observed for the absorption maximum of sensitizer FNE66 as compared with reference sensitizer FNE32. This is obviously due to the much less electron donating capability of benzene ring as compared with the thiophene ring. Furthermore, when the cyanoacrylic acid unit in sensitizer FNE66 is replaced by carboxylic acid, sensitizer FNE67 exhibits the maximum absorption wavelength at 511 nm with a hypsochromic shift of 14 nm in comparison to that of sensitizer FNE66, which is similar to those of sensitizers FNE64 and FNE65. Moreover, in comparison to sensitizers FNE64 and FNE65 with the D–A–π–A configuration, sensitizers FNE66 and FNE67 with the D–π–A–π–A configuration exhibit hypsochromically shifted absorption maxima by 47 and 38 nm, respectively, which indicates that the D–A–π–A framework is superior to the D–π–A–π–A configuration in expanding the absorption spectrum and enhancing the light-harvesting capability. This is inconsistent with our previously reported results12c because of their different π spacers in both cases.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the target sensitizers on TiO2 films are recorded and shown in Fig. 3. Sensitizers FNE64, FNE65, FNE66, and FNE67 demonstrate the maximum absorption wavelength at 543, 524, 518, and 492 nm, respectively, which displays the same trend as those in toluene solutions. A slight hypsochromic shift of 29, 25, 7, and 19 nm, respectively, can be found for the absorption maxima of dye-loaded TiO2 films with respect to those in toluene solutions. Such hypsochromic shifts of the absorption spectra for organic dyes absorbed on the TiO2 films have also been observed in other D–(π)–A–π–A featured organic dyes and can be due to the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid.11 To further investigate the influence of the anchoring group on the dye-loading amount, the adsorption amounts of sensitizers FNE64, FNE65, FNE66, and FNE67 are measured to be 1.80 × 10−8, 1.27 × 10−8, 1.65 × 10−8, and 1.18 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1, respectively. It can be found that the surface concentration of cyanoacrylic acid based sensitizers is slightly higher than that of carboxylic acid based sensitizers, which can be probably due to the relatively stronger binding effect of cyanoacrylic acid on TiO2 semiconductors.

Electrochemical properties
To further investigate the energy levels of the target sensitizers and evaluate the possibility of the dye regeneration and the photo-generated electron injection, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell with TiO2 films stained with the organic sensitizer as the working electrode in a solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in water-free acetonitrile with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 (Fig. 4). The data are presented in Table 1. The observed oxidation potentials, corresponding to the HOMO energy levels of sensitizers FNE64, FNE65, FNE66 and FNE67, are determined to be 1.00, 0.97, 0.97 and 1.03 V (vs. NHE, same below), respectively, which are more positive than the redox potential of the I−/I3− redox couples (∼0.4 V),20 indicating that the reduction of oxidized dyes with I− ions is thermodynamically feasible. The close HOMO values for these organic sensitizers arise from the oxidation of the same triarylamine moiety. It should be noted that electrochemistry measures the ionization potential and electron affinity. The HOMO and LUMO are just theoretical constructs but still valid to estimate the energy gap.21 Correspondingly, the LUMO energy level was calculated from eqn (1), LUMO = HOMO − ΔE(1)where ΔE is the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO levels and derived from the wavelength at 10% maximum absorption intensity for the dye-loaded TiO2 film.22 The LUMO energy levels of dyes FNE32, FNE64, FNE65, FNE66 and FNE67 are calculated to be −0.64, −0.75, −0.86, −0.91 and −0.96 V, respectively. Generally, it is considered that a minimum offset of around 0.3 eV between the LUMO of the organic sensitizer and the CB edge of the TiO2 electrode (−0.5 V),20 which determines the driving force for the excited electron injection, is needed to ensure fast and efficient electron injection. As compared with FNE32 with a LUMO level of −0.64 V where the driving force for electron injection from the oxidized dye molecules into the TiO2 is insufficient, the target thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine based sensitizers have gradually upward shifted the LUMO levels, which results in an increased capability of photo-generated electron injection from the excited organic dye to the TiO2 semiconductor. Moreover, in comparison with sensitizers FNE64 and FNE65 with a single phenylene unit, sensitizers FNE66 and FNE67 with double phenylene units have successfully lifted up the LUMO levels. This is due to the fact that the HOMO partially delocalizes on the phenylene units, which therefore weakens the electron-withdrawing property of the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine group and therefore lifts up the LUMO levels. Therefore, it can be concluded that the LUMO energy levels of D–(π)–A–π–A featured organic sensitizers can be precisely tuned upon the optimization of either the π-conjugation spacer or the anchoring group.
 Fig. 4  Cyclic voltammograms of the dye-loaded TiO2 films (0.25 cm2). 
Theoretical approach
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the target sensitizers are performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory23 to gain insight into the geometrical structures and the frontier orbitals. As shown in the optimized conformation (Fig. 5), the dihedral angles between the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine unit and the neighbouring thiophene ring in sensitizer FNE32 is calculated to be 6°, which are generalized observation for dihedral angles between two thiophene rings. When the bridged thiophene rings are replaced by benzene rings, the dihedral angles between the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine unit and the neighbouring benzene ring are calculated to be 16° and 20°, respectively, for sensitizers FNE64 and FNE65. Moreover, when an auxiliary benzene ring is incorporated between the triarylamine and thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine unit, the dihedral angles between the benzene ring in the triarylamine moiety and the inserted phenylene unit in sensitizers FNE66 and FNE67 increase to 32° and 33°, respectively, which are general dihedral angles between two benzene rings. While the dihedral angles between the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine unit and the neighbouring thiophene ring is calculated to be 19° and 20°, respectively, for sensitizers FNE66 and FNE67. It should be noted that when an auxiliary benzene ring is inserted between the triarylamine and thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine in sensitizers FNE64 and FNE65 with the D–A–π–A configuration, a more twisted molecular structure can be observed for both sensitizers FNE66 and FNE67 with the D–π–A–π–A configuration. Therefore, although the π-conjugation is geometrically extended through the incorporated phenylene unit, a worse charge delocalization is found in the D–π–A–π–A featured organic sensitizers with phenylene bridges, which results in the weakened ICT interactions and is consistent with their absorption maxima (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 5  Optimized ground state geometry and related dihedral angels for sensitizers FNE32, FNE64, FNE65, FNE66, and FNE67. 
The energy levels and the frontier molecular orbitals of the target sensitizers were also calculated. As listed in Table 1, although the calculated LUMO levels are different from the experimental ones, the qualitative trends of the theoretical LUMO levels are mostly similar to those experimentally determined ones. Fig. 6 displays the calculated frontier molecular orbitals of the organic sensitizers. It can be clearly found that for sensitizers FNE32, FNE64, and FNE65, the HOMOs delocalize on the triarylamine moiety with extension to the whole molecular skeleton, while the LUMOs delocalize on the two acceptors and extend to the nitrogen in the triarylamine. The overlap of the HOMOs and LUMOs facilitates the charge transfer from the electron-donating center to the electron-withdrawing center.24 In contrast, for sensitizers FNE66 and FNE67, the HOMOs mainly delocalize on the triarylamine moiety and the neighboring phenylene bridge, while the LUMOs mainly delocalize on the two acceptors and two bridged benzene rings. As compared with sensitizers FNE64 and FNE65 with the D–A–π–A configuration, the different frontier molecular orbital delocalizations on D–π–A–π–A featured sensitizers FNE66 and FNE67 indicate differed ICT interactions in these organic sensitizers with similar donors and acceptors. Moreover, for all the sensitizers with either cyanoacrylic acid or carboxylic acid as the anchoring group, the LUMOs delocalize over the anchoring acid groups. Thus, upon excitation by sunlight, the excited electrons may transfer from the triarylamine center to the anchoring group and further possibly into TiO2 under the condition of sufficient electron injection driving force.

Solar cell performance
The quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the prepared sensitizers (0.3 mM) were fabricated with a polymer gel electrolyte containing 5% PVDF–HFP (w/w) in MPN. To achieve the best DSSC performance, the content of deoxycholic acid (DCA) in the dye bath and tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in the electrolyte was firstly optimized for FNE66 based quasi-solid-state DSSC since it provided the best performance in our initial measurements. In general, the utilization of DCA as a coadsorbate,25 which is simultaneously adsorbed on the TiO2 electrode during the dye adsorption process, has been proved to be an efficient method to improve the DSSC performance due to the suppression of dye aggregation and prevention of the backward electron transfer. Therefore, the effect of DCA was firstly investigated by mixing various concentrations of DCA with FNE66 in the dye bath for fabricating sensitized TiO2 films. The performance data are summarized in Table 2. When the concentration of DCA increases from 0 to 10 mM, both open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current (Jsc) increase upon the addition of DCA in the dye bath. This obviously stemmed from the coadsorption of the additive DCA, which weakens the intermolecular interactions and thus reduces the charge recombination rate in the quasi-solid-state DSSCs. However, when the DCA concentration increases to 20 mM, both the Voc and Jsc values decrease to some extent since the coadsorbed DCA molecules occupy the binding sites on the TiO2 film, inducing a decrease in the amount of organic dyes loaded on the TiO2 films.

It is well known that TBP is a commonly used species in the electrolyte to improve the DSSC performance26 since the coordination between electronegative pyridine and TiO2 negatively shifts the TiO2 conduction band edge. Therefore, the content of TBP in the electrolyte was also optimized and it is found to greatly affect the DSSC performance (Table 3). When the content of TBP increases from 0 to 0.1 M and further to 0.5 M, the Voc value gradually increases along with the TBP concentration but Jsc values achieve the highest at 0.1 M TBP. The increased Voc value is mainly attributed to the negative shift of the conduction band of TiO2 caused by the adsorption of TBP on the TiO2 surface. On the other hand, the Jsc value increases from 13.63 to 17.25 mA cm−2 upon the addition of 0.1 M TBP, probably owing to the reduced charge recombination rate, and then decreases to 13.71 mA cm−2 at 0.5 M TBP due to the reduction of the driving force for the electron injection from the excited dye molecule to the conduction band of the titania semiconductor. Therefore, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the target sensitizers with DCA (10 mM) were fabricated using a quasi-solid-state electrolyte containing 0.1 M TBP.

The action spectra of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) as a function of incident wavelength for the quasi-solid-state DSSCs were recorded and shown in Fig. 7. The maximum IPCE values for the quasi-solid-state DSSCs increase following the order FNE32 < FNE64 < FNE65 < FNE66 < FNE67. According to the formula (2):27 IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ) × Φinj × Φc(2)where LHE(λ) is the light-harvesting efficiency, Φinj is the electron injection efficiency, and Φc is the charge collection efficiency, since the LHE for the dye-loaded 15 μm thick TiO2 film is close to unity for all the three devices, the much lower IPCE values for the DSSCs based on FNE32, FNE64, and FNE65 stemmed from their insufficient driving force for electron injection from the excited FNE32, FNE64 or FNE65 molecules to the TiO2 conduction band, as revealed by the electrochemical study. Moreover, compared with the IPCE spectra of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on FNE65 and FNE67 with carboxylic acid as the anchoring group, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on FNE64 and FNE66 with cyanoacrylic acid as the anchoring group display much broader IPCE spectra obviously due to their wider photo-response range, which is consistent with the absorption spectra of the dye loaded TiO2 films. These results indicate that not only broad absorption spectra but also suitable energy levels are required for ideal photon-to-current conversion in the DSSCs.

The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs were measured under standard AM1.5G solar light (100 mW cm−2) and are displayed in Fig. 8. The detailed photovoltaic parameters in terms of Jsc, Voc, fill factor (FF), and η of each DSSC are listed in Table 3. The quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on FNE64 and FNE65 produce a Jsc of 13.38 and 12.55 mA cm−2, respectively. Upon the incorporation of an additional benzene ring as the spacer, sensitizer FNE66 and FNE67 based DSSCs provide an improved Jsc of 17.25 and 14.44 mA cm−2, respectively. In general, the Jsc can be expressed by eqn (3):28 (3)where h is Plank's constant, c is the speed of light in vacuum, and λ1 and λ2 are the limits of the active spectrum of the DSSC. Therefore, although the absorption spectra of sensitizers FNE64 and FNE65 are broadened in comparison to those of sensitizers FNE66 and FNE67, respectively, the latter sensitizer based quasi-solid-state DSSCs produce higher Jsc values, which is consistent with the trend of the photo-generated current integrated from the IPCE spectra. It should be noted that all the Jsc values of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the four target sensitizers are higher than that for the FNE32 based quasi-solid-state DSSC (11.29 mA cm−2) under its best conditions, which is attributed to the improved driving force for electron injection from the excited dye molecules to the TiO2 semiconductor. Correspondingly, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on sensitizers FNE64, FNE65, FNE66, and FNE67 produced a Voc of 599, 622, 611, and 646 mV, respectively, and a FF of 69%, 73%, 68%, and 67%, respectively, corresponding to a η of 5.5%, 5.7%, 7.2%, and 6.2%, respectively.

J–V curves for the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on sensitizers FNE32, FNE64, FNE65, FNE66, and FNE67. 
Generally, Voc is defined as the potential difference between the quasi-Fermi potential of electrons (EFermi) in the titania semiconductor and the redox potential (Eredox) of the electrolytes, which could be described by eqn (4):29 (4)where β is a characteristic constant of the TiO2 tailing states, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, q is the elementary charge, and Ncb is the total number of conduction band states in the semiconductor, n is the number of electrons in the titania semiconductor. Therefore, Voc is judged by the conduction band position of the titania semiconductor and the charge recombination rate in DSSCs. To further explain the Voc difference among the fabricated quasi-solid-state DSSCs, the conduction band edge position of the dye loaded titania films was firstly studied by charge extraction30 and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurements.31 At constant photo-induced charge density (Q), a higher Voc indicates an upward shift of the conduction band edge, and vice versa. As shown in Fig. 9 which illustrates the relationship between Voc and Q at open circuit for the fabricated quasi-solid-state DSSCs, the Voc values increase linearly with the logarithm of Q for all DSSCs. All the curves for the corresponding devices have almost the same slope (143 mV) and coincide with each other. At a fixed Q, the almost same Voc values for all DSSCs indicate the identical conduction band edge positions. Therefore, it can be concluded that modification of the LUMO levels has no obvious influence on the conduction band edge of titania semiconductors.

Therefore, the Voc difference can be ascribed to the various charge recombination rates which are related to electron lifetime (τ) in the DSSCs.32 The electron lifetime was measured by IMVS and obtained from the frequency at the top of the semicircle (fmin) according to eqn (5):33 (5)

Fig. 10 shows the electron lifetime as a function of charge density at open circuit. The electron lifetime for a certain DSSCs decreases with charge density following a power law relation with the same slope, suggesting the same charge recombination mechanism in the four quasi-solid-state DSSCs. Moreover, the electron lifetime in the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on FNE66 and FNE67 with the D–π–A–π–A structure is much longer at a certain charge density in comparison to that of the DSSC based on D–A–π–A featured FNE64 and FNE65, respectively. This originates from the fact that FNE66 and FNE67 with the D–π–A–π–A structure with more twisted structures can weaken the intermolecular interactions and thus reduce the charge recombination between electrons in the TiO2 film and electron acceptors in the electrolyte more efficiently than FNE64 and FNE65 with the D–A–π–A structure. Consequently, when more charge is accumulated in TiO2, the Fermi level moves upward, resulting in a Voc enhancement (ΔVoc) which is related to the electron density (n) or charge density (Q) changes and follows eqn (6): 34 (6)

At 100 W m−2 white LED light, the extracted charge densities are 31, 37, 35, and 44 μC cm−2 for the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on FNE64, FNE65, FNE66, and FNE67, respectively. According to eqn (6), the Voc gain from the FNE64 sensitized quasi-solid-state DSSC to FNE65, FNE66, and FNE67 based DSSCs arising solely from the reduced charge recombination rate and increased charge density is calculated to be 25, 17, and 50 mV, respectively. This is in good agreement with the experimentally observed Voc difference between the FNE64 sensitized quasi-solid-state DSSC and those based on FNE65 (23 mV), FNE66 (12 mV), and FNE67 (47 mV), respectively (Table 3).
The most advantage of quasi-solid-state DSSCs is their stability during long-time operation which is considered as an important requirement for further practical applications.35 Therefore, the stability of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the resulting sensitizers was recorded over a period of 1000 h under one sun soaking. Fig. 11 displays the photovoltaic performance parameters of FNE66 based quasi-solid-state DSSCs. It can be found that Jsc, Voc and η values slightly improve initially. Then the Jsc dropped but Voc increased within 5% with sunlight soaking time, while FF and η parameters remained almost constant after 1000 h of one sun soaking, which indicates that sensitizer FNE66 is sufficiently stable for DSSC applications.

Conclusions
In summary, four organic sensitizers based on thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine with different numbers of phenylene bridges and different anchoring groups have been designed and synthesized. Compared with reference FNE32 whose photo-response range is over 900 nm, either the replacement of thiophene by the benzene spacer or the incorporation of carboxylic acid instead of cyanoacrylic acid can lift up the LUMO levels of the organic sensitizers and ensure more efficient electron injection. Although hypsochromically shifted absorption maxima are achieved for the target sensitizers upon energy level optimization, the η value of the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on sensitizer FNE66 increases by 95% as compared with that of the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on sensitizer FNE32 with panchromatic absorption. Therefore, at a fixed auxiliary acceptor, other building blocks in D–(π)–A–π–A featured organic sensitizers can be tuned to optimize the energy levels to ensure sufficient driving force for charge injection and dye regeneration. These results will help us to understand the critical importance of energy level engineering and provide a path for designing organic sensitizers with the D–(π)–A–π–A configuration.
