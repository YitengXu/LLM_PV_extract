Specifically, three symmetrically-functionalized and three unsymmetrically-functionalized ullazine cores were constructed from 1-(2,6-dialkynylphenyl)-1H-pyrroles via controlled electrophilic cyclizations of highly electron-poor pentafluorosulfanylated (i.e., SF5-containing) phenylethynyl moieties onto the pyrrole. While the diminished reactivity of the electron-poor alkynes was initially problematic, this feature was subsequently found to be pivotal in facilitating thermal control of mono- versus double 6-endo-trig ring-closure in the key step. Iodinated ullazine products were shown to undergo further facile transformation into more complex unsymmetrical targets. The synthetic strategies reported herein grant access to a host of symmetrically- and unsymmetrically-decorated fluorine-rich ullazines with potential value as light-harvesting materials (e.g., dye-sensitized solar cells, organic photovoltaics) or as advanced intermediates for further synthetic elaboration.
Introduction
There has been extensive research on polycyclic heteroaromatic arenes (PHAs) due to their relevance to organic electronics, e.g., organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), etc.1 One class of PHAs, based on the nitrogen-containing 16π-electron ullazine core that is isoelectronic with pyrene (Fig. 1), has recently emerged as a hot topic due to its outstanding performance in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).2–7 Following its debut synthesis in 1983,8 scant attention was paid to the ullazines in subsequent decades because of their non-trivial synthesis and perceived lack of applications. However, the advent of new synthetic methods and the newfound ability of ullazines to harvest solar energy have resulted in their revival.9–14 Contemporary methods for constructing the ullazine framework include acid-promoted and metal-catalyzed cyclizations of 1-(2,6-dialkynylphenyl)-1H-pyrroles,2,15–18 along with several annulation-based strategies.7,17

Aside from ongoing interest in ullazine core synthesis, substantial effort has also gone into developing methods to selectively functionalize various peripheral positions of the N-heterocycle,19 as this would enable rational tuning of its optoelectronic properties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) coefficients of ullazine are concentrated along the periphery (Fig. 1).2,13 Also noteworthy is a nodal plane passing through C6, where substituents can be installed to confer solubility and stability without altering overall optoelectronic character.2,7,10,18,20 Functionalization of other positions has also been investigated recently,2,9,10,14 with 1-, 2-, 5-, and 7-substituted ullazines receiving extra attention since the installation of strong acceptors at these positions produce strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character that is beneficial to light-harvesting.2,5,9,10 Similarly, ullazines bearing acceptors at C4 and C8 have also displayed strong ICT, though in these two cases the overall molecular planarity could be compromised.2 Lastly, Gerson et al. have also shown that substitution at C3 and C9 can lead to stabilization of the resulting ullazines.2,21
In regard to light-harvesting molecules for DSSCs, OPVs, organic solar cells (OSCs), and perovskite solar cells, fluorinated π-conjugated systems have recently been shown to boost device efficiency.22–33 Reasons for this remain unclear due to the wide diversity of structures and complexity of the underlying physics. However, contemporary hypotheses suggest that fluorination may lower HOMO energies to promote higher open circuit voltages (Voc) and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).13,24,25,33 It is also believed that enhanced efficiencies may be due to higher fill factors (FF) arising from the ability of F atoms to modulate aggregation morphologies and improve solid-state packing via intermolecular interactions (e.g., F⋯H, F⋯π, and F⋯S).25,34 Nonetheless, the discovery of the “F effect” has sparked interest in the synthesis of fluorine-rich π-conjugated structures for light-harvesting applications.
In this work, we sought to access fluorine-rich ullazines from readily available precursors containing the electron-withdrawing pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5) group.35–41 First introduced by Sheppard in the 1960s, the intriguing fluorine-rich SF5 moiety has received widespread interest from organic, medicinal, and materials chemists.35 From a materials perspective, SF5 is an interesting acceptor to explore, especially given the renewed interest in unconventional electron-deficient molecular designs.42 The main challenge encountered during the synthesis was the low reactivity of the electron-deficient SF5-substituted alkynes towards 6-endo-trig cycloaromatizations. In our efforts to address the problem, we incidentally found the low reactivity useful in allowing thermal control of double vs. mono cyclization, which granted selective access to symmetrical (U1–U3) and unsymmetrical ullazines (U4–U10), respectively.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The six fluorine-rich ullazines were derived from a common intermediate 5, 1-(2,6-diethynylphenyl)-1H-pyrrole, synthesized from commercially available 1 (Scheme 1). Specifically, 4-(pentafluorosulfanyl)aniline 1 underwent double ortho-bromination in the first step, followed by a Clauson–Kaas reaction with 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran to generate pyrrole 3, which was subjected to double Sonogashira coupling with (trimethylsilyl)acetylene and subsequent basic deprotection to afford 5 in 52% yield over four steps.

Dialkyne 5 was further coupled with different aryl halides via Sonogashira reaction to yield intermediates 6–9, which can undergo double electrophilic cyclizations to yield ullazines U1–U4 (Scheme 2). U1 was obtained in 83% yield via facile InCl3-promoted Fürstner-type cycloaromatization in refluxing toluene.2 Attempts to extend this methodology to the more highly fluorinated substrates 7–9 were unsuccessful. When reaction temperatures between 100–120 °C were used, only moderate yields of the mono-cyclized product 10 were observed (Table 1, entries 7 and 8). This was likely due to the additional electron-withdrawing SF5 groups, which lower the nucleophilicity of the pyrrole following the first cyclization and render the second ring-closure impossible under the same conditions.

To address this problem, various conditions for the double electrophilic cyclization were screened (Table 1). We initially adopted the Brønsted acid method by Langer,18 who had reported ullazines bearing electronegative groups (e.g., F and CF3) at the same positions. In our case, the use of excess protic acid either failed to convert the SF5-functionalized 7, or resulted in its decomposition (Table 1, entries 1–6). The lack of reactivity at 20 °C was again attributed to the electron-poor system, while decomposition at 120 °C in the presence of strong acids was likely due to destruction of the SF5 moiety.35,43 It must be noted that even with F and CF3 in the Langer case,18 observed yields were rather modest (30–40%), which highlighted the need for a feasible method to prepare electron-deficient ullazines.
Following the lack of success with protic acids, we revisited the use of Lewis acid promoters for the cycloaromatization. Faced with a dearth of examples in the context of ullazine synthesis from electron-deficient alkyne precursors, we scoured the literature for methods involving other heterocycles as well as carbocycles.44–47 Indeed, in almost all cases featuring electronegative substituents (e.g., F, CF3, CN, NO2), isolated yields were consistently low.46,47 In the absence of promising precedents, we then entertained the option of modifying the InCl3 method, which had cleanly afforded mono-SF5-functionalized ullazine U1 without incurring decomposition products. By carrying out the reaction at 140 °C in xylenes, the doubly-cyclized product U2 was observed for the first time, accompanied by a small quantity of monocyclized product (Table 1, entry 9). Again, no decomposition products were observed. Gratifyingly, upon performing the reaction at 160 °C in mesitylene, the desired U2 was obtained exclusively in 73% yield (Table 1, entry 10). Results were further improved by replacing the mesitylene solvent with o-dichlorobenzene, which afforded U2 in 81% yield. Late-stage optimization also revealed that the InCl3 could be used in sub-stoichiometric quantities, with only minor detriment to the yield (Table 1, entry 12). The structure of U2 was confirmed by NMR, mass spectrometry, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Fig. S1;† CCDC no. 1923328†). Applying these new conditions to the heavily fluorinated 8 and 9, we were likewise successful in effecting twofold cyclization to U3 and U4 in excellent yields (82% and 84%, respectively).
During the course of the above studies, we incidentally discovered that mono-cyclized products 10 and 11 could be selectively obtained in good yields from 7 and 8 by running the reactions at lower temperatures that are sub-optimal for double cyclization (Table 1, entries 7 and 13). The significance of breaking the symmetry at this stage lies in the prospect of synthesizing unsymmetrically-substituted ullazines. In essence, the sluggish reactivity of the electron-poor system enables selective preparation of symmetrical and unsymmetrical ullazines via facile thermal control. Compounds 10 and 11 were amenable to a second round of cycloaromatization, either to give U2 and U3 using InCl3, or to unsymmetrical ullazines via the action of other electrophiles. In this regard, we were especially interested in iodocyclization,48 which would provide an iodine handle for further functionalization and tuning of properties. For practical reasons (e.g., chromatographic separation), we found that the two-stage double electrophilic cyclization was best achieved with iodocyclization as the first step and InIII-catalyzed cycloisomerization in the second. Specifically, 7 and 8 were converted to mono-iodocyclized 12 and 13 with isolated yields >70% (Scheme 3). Compounds 12 and 13 were in turn cycloisomerized at high temperatures in the presence of InCl3 to the unsymmetrical iodine-containing ullazines U5 and U6 in 58% and 65% yield, respectively (Scheme 3). To expand the scope of these iodinated derivatives, we took compounds 12 and U5 and further investigated the possibility of subsequent synthetic elaboration, starting with an attempt to obtain the cyanated ullazine U7 (Scheme 4). Here, two routes were examined, i.e., direct access via CuI-mediated substitution of the iodine atom in U5 with CN, and a second route where substitution of I with CN in 12 was carried out before the cycloisomerization step to the identical target U7. Experimentally, results revealed that the second pathway led to higher isolated yields over two steps (60% vs. 45%). This can be attributed to the lower observed yield (58%) of the high-temperature cycloisomerization step when the reaction was carried out on an iodine-containing substrate (Scheme 4). Conversely, when the iodine in 12 was first substituted with CN, subsequent cycloisomerization to the ullazine proceeded in 80% yield. Using this two-step substitution/cycloisomerization approach, intermediate 12 was also successfully converted to additional ullazine derivatives U8–U10 (Scheme 4). Specifically, the iodine synthetic handle was replaced with acceptor- or donor-bearing aryl and arylethynyl moieties via Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira and Suzuki couplings.

Photophysical studies
Eight ullazines U1–U4 and U7–U10 were studied by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy to determine their photophysical properties (Fig. 2). The iodine-containing U5 and U6 were non-fluorescent. For clarity, the spectra are also depicted individually in the ESI (Fig. S2†). The UV-vis spectra of six of the ullazines (U1–U4, U9, and U10), which bear non-coplanar substitutions on the ullazine core at the C3, C9, or C4 positions, showed similar absorption bands between 360–470 nm, with corresponding estimated optical bandgaps of 2.6–2.7 eV (Table 2). While the UV-vis spectra of U7 and U8 showed strong ICT bands between 420–550 nm with smaller optical bandgaps of 2.3–2.4 eV (Table 2) due to the strong electron-withdrawing effects exerted by the C4 cyano group and ethynylphenyl SF5 group, which are coplanar with the ullazine core. The eight compounds also displayed fluorescence maxima between 500–530 nm, with low quantum yields (0.03–0.12) that are characteristic of ullazines. Observed Stokes shifts corresponding to the S1–S0 transitions were generally large (Δλ range from 1013–2298 cm−1), suggesting relatively strong ICT effects (see pp. S5–S6 of the ESI†). Cyclic voltammetry was also performed on U1–U4 and U7–U10 (Table 2 and Fig. S5†). Electrochemical HOMO levels (EHOMO) of the eight ullazines were calculated from their onset of oxidation on the voltammograms, while electrochemical LUMO levels were estimated from the EHOMO and optical gaps (i.e., ELUMO = EHOMO + Eopticalg). Going from U1 to U3, both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were observed to be driven deeper from −5.25 eV and −2.55 eV to −5.45 eV and −2.83 eV, respectively. This lowering of FMO energy levels corresponds to the successive SF5-substitution of the pendent phenyls at C3 and C9. Despite being relatively distal from the ullazine core, the SF5 groups were still able to remotely tune the electronic properties due to their exceptional electron-accepting ability. The LUMO levels of U2 and U3 were compared against that of a previously reported electron-deficient analogue and found to be even lower (ESI,† pp. S136–137). As expected, the ullazine (U7) that was simultaneously functionalized with both SF5 and CN acceptors exhibited the lowest LUMO level (−3.02 eV) of the series.

Compared to previously reported ullazine derivatives of analogous structure such as A and B (Table 3),10,18U1 showed generally similar photophysical properties since the C6 substituent lies in the nodal plane of the frontier orbitals of the ullazine core. Interestingly, only U1 and B exhibit reversible oxidation waves in electrochemical studies18 while A showed irreversible oxidation that involved a reversible electron transfer followed by an irreversible chemical reaction (ErCi) mechanism. The reversible oxidation waves for U1 and B suggest that the electron-withdrawing substituents could potentially stabilize the electrochemically-generated radical cations by lowering the energy of the singly-occupied molecular orbitals (SOMO) of these ullazines. A more pronounced effect on the spectroscopic properties, particularly the emission wavelength, could be obtained by substituting the pendent phenyl groups with SF5 moieties, as observed in U2–U4. In general, the SF5 at C6 has minimal effect on optical properties as it lies in the nodal plane of the HOMO and LUMO of the ullazine core. For the ullazines substituted at C3, C4, C8, and C9 (which do not reside in the nodal plane), the effects of substitution depend also on the degree of coplanarity—and hence conjugation—between the substituents and the ullazine core. For example, compared to U9 and U10 whose substitutents at C3 and C4 are aryl-based, U7 and U8 feature substituents (cyano, ethynyl) at C4 that are better coupled to the ullazine core and thus exert more pronounced effects on the HOMO and LUMO levels and other optoelectronic properties resulting therefrom (Table 2).

Conclusion
We report ten novel ullazines (U1–U10) in this work, of which six were synthesized via controlled cycloaromatizations of electron-poor alkynes and an additional four through subsequent synthetic elaborations of key intermediates. These N-heterocycles were characterized by NMR (1H, 13C, 19F), HRMS and/or elemental analysis, while U1–U4 and U7–U10 were further studied using photophysical, electrochemical, and DFT methods. Synthesis-wise, we have developed an optimized suite of methods that enable well-controlled electrophilic cyclizations of exceptionally electron-deficient alkynes. This grants access to symmetrically and unsymmetrically-functionalized fluorine-rich ullazines with potential utility in solar energy conversion and other optoelectronic applications.
