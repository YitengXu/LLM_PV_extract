    , Accepted 8th June 2020First published on 12th June 2020AbstractThermoelectric power generation from solar radiation or waste heat has attracted tremendous attention due to strong global demand for cost-effective, pollution-free forms of energy conversion. However, the storage and sustainable release of thermal energy, as essential factors for thermoelectric generators (TEGs), remain great challenges. Herein, a TEG based on phase change aerogels (PCAs) has been fabricated to enhance the solar–thermal–electric energy conversion. The PCAs exhibit synergistic phase change properties, excellent thermal reliability, and shape-stabilized properties and can overcome the drawbacks of enthalpy degradation and leakage existing in the phase change materials (PCMs). Under the radiation of simulated solar light, the voltage and current output of the PCA-loaded TEG (∼144 mV, 14.8 mA) are approximately 3 times and 2.7 times that of a blank one (∼48 mV, 5.4 mA), respectively, and the thermal-to-electricity conversion maximum efficiency is enhanced by about 61.3% compared to that of the blank one. The sustained thermal release based on PCAs enables a sustainable electric output when solar light or the heat source is removed. In proof-of-concept experiments, the PCA-loaded TEGs can instantly light up commercial LEDs, drive various portable electronic gadgets, and charge several different capacitors. The sustainable lighting time of eighty green LEDs directly powered by PCA-loaded TEGs is about 4 times longer than that of the blank one. In particular, the maximum value of the voltage difference (ΔV) of LEDs powered by PCA-loaded TEGs and the blank one is up to 1.74 V. Therefore, the PCA-loaded TEGs have enhanced power supply capability when removing solar radiation or the heat source. This study expands the application of PCMs in TEGs and promises a new potential application in advanced energy-related devices and systems for solar energy utilization and storage, self-powered sensing systems, waste heat reuse and other fields.
1. Introduction
With the ever-growing energy demand and serious environmental pollution from the burning of fossil fuels, the development of high-performance, low-cost, and environmentally friendly energy storage techniques has become a considerably important issue.1–3 Therein, developing some clean, renewable and green energies has become an efficient and potential way to achieve sustainable development for human beings.1 In recent studies, clean energies, with satisfactory power generation efficiency, have been developed rapidly, such as micromechanical motion-driven nanogenerators,4–6 solar cells,7 and wind power plants.8 However, these rising new energy resources are completely insignificant as compared with the immense energy consumption and waste.9 As is well-known, the loss of energy is mainly consumed in the form of thermal energy in the industrial fields and daily life nowadays.9 As a solid-state device, thermoelectric generators (TEGs) can directly generate electricity from a heat source, which is mainly used in the fields of power generation, heating and refrigeration, temperature sensing, etc. A TEG can directly convert thermal energy based on the temperature difference (ΔT) into electricity through a process called the Seebeck effect or thermoelectric effect,2,3 and its systems possess many advantages like silent operation, high reliability, compactness, low production cost, long operating life, and environmental friendliness. However, low thermal-to-electricity conversion efficiency has been identified as the main obstacle to the development of thermoelectric power generation.10
According to previous reports,10,11 the maximum theoretical thermal-to-electricity conversion efficiency (ηTEG) of TEG can be calculated using the following formula: (1)where, ZT, Tc, Th, and ΔT are the figure of merit of thermoelectric materials, the temperature of the cold and hot sides of the TEG, and the temperature difference (ΔT = Th − Tc) across its hot and cold sides, respectively. It is generally known that most commercial thermoelectric materials at present (commonly telluride alloys) typically give a limited ZT of about 0.8 at room temperature. The efficiency of the TEG depends mainly on the available ΔT. Thus, maintaining a large ΔT across the two sides of the TEG device becomes significantly important.
As thermal energy storage materials, phase change materials (PCMs) can absorb significant amounts of energy as latent heat and then release it into the surroundings during the phase change process over a defined temperature range.12 Meanwhile, PCMs have advantages of high thermal energy storage and strong temperature control capacity. Therefore, PCMs are considered one of the most potential energy storage materials for the future.13 Based on previous studies,10,14–18 composite PCMs with excellent solar absorption ability and solar thermal conversion capacity can maximize the average ΔT of thermoelectric devices. Moreover, TEG can convert light-induced thermal energy to electrical energy.9 Recently, Tu et al. fabricated a series of novel TEGs based on paraffin/expanded graphite composite PCMs by melt impregnation, in which the latent heat of the composite PCMs is reduced largely as the mass fraction of expanded graphite increases.10 Thus, it is necessary to explore the appropriate proportion of expanded graphite to construct TEGs with optimum thermoelectric properties. The final experimental evidence verifies that the fabricated TEG based on paraffin/5 wt% expanded graphite composite PCM results in the highest ΔT, and then produces the largest total energy output and the highest portion of high-grade electrical energy.10 Wang et al. carried out theoretical analysis on the possibility of using PCMs to reinforce the heat transfer properties of the hot side of a TEG, and their results showed that the existence of appropriate PCMs can significantly improve the output power and efficiency of the TEG.19 Despite the accessibility to solar radiation being periodic in nature, the TEGs based on PCMs still enable sustainability of the electric output because the heat accumulated in PCMs can be released for thermoelectric generation during the “dark” period.
As an organic solid–liquid PCM, methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) mono-methacrylate (m-PEGMA, a derivative of polyethylene glycol) is a class of high-performance PCMs owing to its comparatively high latent heat enthalpy, low super-cooling, good thermal reliability, and nontoxic nature and the absence of phase separation during the phase change process.20 However, two major challenges need to be overcome in developing advanced PCMs for TEGs, such as the poor shape stability and how to improve the solar energy conversion.21 Numerous efforts have been devoted to introducing new supporting materials and developing shape-stabilized PCMs to address these technical issues.2,22–26 Therein, graphene-based three-dimensional aerogels (GAs) have drawn considerable attention due to their unique properties, including low density, large specific surface area, excellent thermal and electrical conductivities and excellent mechanical properties.27,28 Therefore, a series of shape-stabilized PCMs have been fabricated by integrating GAs into PCMs.27,29–31 However, a complex two-step method was applied to prepare GA-based composite PCMs in previous relevant studies.27,30,31 The first step is to prepare GAs by a hydrothermal or metal-template method. And the second step is to prepare GA-based composite PCMs by solution impregnation or melt impregnation. The two-step method not only makes the preparation process too complicated, but also there is only physical interaction between the supporting material and the phase change working substance. The addition of GAs as a supporting material is beneficial for shape stabilization and achieving efficient solar energy conversion of solid–liquid PCMs. However, it is inevitable for GAs to occupy a certain space, which leads to a decrease in the thermal enthalpy (heat storage capacity).21,26,32 Therefore, the fabrication of GA-based composite PCMs without enthalpy degradation is subject to critical challenges through a simple, gentle and green method.
In this study, novel GA-based phase change aerogels (PCAs) with a synergistic phase change effect were fabricated via a one-step hydrothermal method. This method is a simple, gentle and green method without any organic solvents. In the synthesis process, a portion of m-PEGMA was grafted onto the surface of GO, and another portion of m-PEGMA was encapsulated or adsorbed in GAs. The existing covalent bond between m-PEGMA and GO can strengthen the molecular attraction in the m-PEGMA/GO PCAs and then enhance their thermal enthalpy.30,33 Compared to c-PCM (control sample), the ΔHm and enthalpy efficiency (χ) of the PCA are increased by 23 J g−1 and 18.2%, respectively. Thus, the obstinate problem of enthalpy degradation in the use of PCMs has been well overcome. Further, the PCAs possessed excellent thermal stability, thermal reliability, and structural stability. As a sustainable power supply, TEGs based on PCAs (namely, PCA-loaded TEGs) have been fabricated. The PCA-loaded TEGs exhibited an enhanced thermal–electric energy conversion based on the solar-to-thermal and synergistic phase change characteristics of PCAs, which provided a relatively high temperature difference ΔT for TEG devices. Under simulated solar light, the voltage and current output of PCA-loaded TEGs are increased approximately 3 and 2.7 times, respectively, and the maximum thermal-to-electricity conversion efficiency is enhanced by 61.3% compared to that of the blank one. The sustained thermal release based on PCAs enables sustainable electric output when the solar light or heat source is removed, and the PCA-loaded TEGs can instantly light up LEDs, drive various electronic gadgets, and charge several capacitors. The sustainable lighting time of eighty green LEDs directly powered by PCA-loaded TEGs is about 4 times longer than that of the blank one. Consequently, the expanding application of PCMs in the TEGs promises a new potential application in advanced energy-related devices and systems for solar energy utilization and storage, self-powered sensing systems, waste heat reuse and other fields.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) mono-methacrylate (m-PEGMA, Mn: 1000, 95%) was purchased from Jining Baichuan Chemical Co., Ltd. Graphene oxide (GO, 5000 mesh) was purchased from Beijing Carbon Century Technology Co., Ltd. Ammonium persulphate (APS, AR) and ethylenediamine (EDA, AR) were provided by the Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute. All reagents were used without further purification.
2.2. Fabrication of GO-based PCAs
The PCAs were fabricated according to previous studies with a slight modification.27,34 Briefly, GO powder was first dispersed in distilled water (20 mL) via sonication for 15 min to form a homogeneous suspension. The GO suspension, m-PEGMA (5 g) and APS (0.05 g) were added into a 50 mL glass bottle. After this, the mixture was ultrasonically dispersed for 10 min to form a uniform dispersion. Then, a certain amount of EDA (as seen in Table S1†) was added and sealed in the glass bottle and then heated for 12 h at 90 °C to fabricate the GO-based phase change hydrogel (PCH). When the reaction was completed, the excess aqueous solution was dumped out of the glass bottle, the as-fabricated PCH was freeze-dried and the PCA was obtained. Here, the loading of GO in the reaction process varied from 0.5 wt% to 5 wt% (i.e., 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 and 5.0 wt%), and the corresponding PCAs were marked as PCA1, PCA2, PCA3, PCA4, PCA5 and PCA6, respectively. The measured densities of PCAs were 0.32–0.37 g cm−3.35 For comparison, a control sample (pure PCM without GO), marked as c-PCM, was fabricated under the same reaction conditions.
2.3. Characterization
The structural, crystalline, shape-stabilized, solar-driven, thermal and thermoelectric properties were characterized using spectroscopic and microscopic analyses, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and a thermoelectric testing system. For details, please refer to the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Reaction mechanism and morphology of the fabricated PCAs
The flow chart and reaction mechanism diagram for the fabrication of PCAs are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. In the one-pot hydrothermal process,27,34 a portion of m-PEGMA was grafted onto the surface of GO, and another portion of m-PEGMA was encapsulated or adsorbed in GAs. The covalent bond between m-PEGMA and GO can improve the intermolecular interaction in m-PEGMA/GO PCAs, which is the key to obtaining enhanced thermal enthalpy and solving the problem of enthalpy degradation. The FT-IR spectra of m-PEGMA, c-PCM, and PCAs are displayed in Fig. 1c and S1a,† where the FT-IR spectra of c-PCM and PCAs demonstrate no change compared with that of raw m-PEGMA. It is noteworthy that the vibrational peak of CC (1645 cm−1, corresponding to the acrylic group of raw m-PEGMA) still appeared in the FT-IR spectra of c-PCM and PCAs, which implies the absence of polymerization of m-PEGMA during the hydrothermal reaction.36 So this means the phase change substrate is still m-PEGMA in c-PCM and PCAs, which is mainly attributed to the presence of 4-methoxyphenol as an inhibitor in the raw m-PEGMA. Fig. 1d shows the Raman spectra of GO and PCAs. All specimens display a strong D band and G band, which arise from the vibrations of sp3-bonded and sp2-bonded carbon atoms of the graphene rings, respectively.37,38 Additionally, the ID/IG ratios of PCAs increase to 1.134 (PCA1), 1.515 (PCA2), 1.256 (PCA3), 1.141 (PCA4), 1.160 (PCA5), and 1.240 (PCA6) in contrast to that of GO (1.082). Variations of the ID/IG ratio mean that the changes in the electronic conjugation state of GO occur after the hydrothermal reaction. It is generally known that the presence of EDA can cause a slight reduction of GO sheets in the hydrothermal reaction process, resulting in a decrease in the ID/IG value of GO.34,39 Even in this case, the ID/IG values of PCAs are still larger than that of GO, indicating an increase in the amount of the sp3 carbon atoms. Furthermore, the D bands in the Raman spectra of PCAs at 1325 (PCA1), 1329 (PCA2), 1327 (PCA3), 1335 (PCA4), 1332 (PCA5), and 1335 cm−1 (PCA6) undergo a red-shift by 14–24 cm−1 in contrast to that of GO (1349 cm−1), indicating the occurrence of electron transfer between the polymers and GO.40 The FT-IR spectra of the raw GO and m-PEGMA-g-GO are shown in Fig. S1b,† where the characteristic stretching vibration peak of CC corresponding to the graphene skeleton is observed at 1650 cm−1,41 but there is no vibrational peak of CC at 1645 cm−1 originating from the acrylic group of raw m-PEGMA is observed in the m-PEGMA-g-GO. However, other characteristic bands of raw m-PEGMA are observed in the FT-IR spectrum of m-PEGMA-g-GO. Therefore, free m-PEGMA molecules were completely removed by exhaustive washing. Both the FT-IR and Raman results confirm the formation of covalent bonds between GO and m-PEGMA molecular chains. Consequently, a portion of m-PEGMA has been grafted covalently onto the surface of GO during the one-pot hydrothermal reaction.

The morphology and microscopic structure of PCAs were characterized by field-emission SEM. The SEM micrographs of c-PCM, PCA1, and PCA5 as examples are presented in Fig. S2a, b and c,† respectively. As displayed in Fig. S2a,† the c-PCM exhibited loose and irregular granular morphology when no GO was added in the hydrothermal reaction system. As shown in Fig. S2b and c,† a foam-like structure with interconnected pores are observed in the PCA1 and PCA5, similar to previous studies.26,28,34 In addition, most of the m-PEGMA samples are encapsulated in the interconnected pores of the GA and a small portion of m-PEGMA is adsorbed/grafted on the surface of graphene sheets.
3.2. Thermal stability, thermal energy storage and shape-stabilized properties

Fig. 2a presents the TGA curves of GO, c-PCM, and PCAs, respectively, and the corresponding data are listed in Table S2.† In Fig. 2a and Table S2,† the residual amounts of 35.09 and 0.00 wt% are observed for GO and c-PCM, respectively. Therefore, the residual amount of PCAs is mainly attributed to the incomplete mass loss of GO. Due to the loss of m-PEGMA in the fabrication process, the actual content of GO in the PCAs is different from that in the reaction process. According to previous studies,41–43 the actual content of GO in PCAs was further analyzed using TGA, and the calculated results are shown in Table S2.† Moreover, the PCAs are thermally stable up to temperatures as high as nearly 325 °C (T5%), which demonstrates the excellent thermal stability of PCAs. Fig. 2b and c display the DSC curves of c-PCM and PCAs during the melting and crystallization processes, respectively. The corresponding DSC thermal properties are listed in Table 1. As illustrated in Fig. 2b and c, both c-PCM and PCAs exhibit strong endothermic and exothermic peaks during the melting and crystallization processes, which indicate the outstanding phase change properties of PCAs.44 As listed in Table 1, slight variations are observed for the Tmo, Tmp, Tco, Tcp, ΔHm and ΔHc of PCAs with different amounts of GO in contrast to c-PCM. The results are attributed to the effects of the GO sheets.45 From Table 1, it is very clear that the ΔHm and ΔHc of PCAs (such as PCA1, PCA2, PCA3, PCA4, PCA5 and PCA6) are substantially higher than those of c-PCM, indicating the synergistic phase change effect of PCAs. In PCAs, a portion of m-PEGMA was grafted onto the surface of GO, and another portion of m-PEGMA was encapsulated or adsorbed in the GA. The covalent bond between m-PEGMA and GO leads to strong molecular attraction in the m-PEGMA/GO PCAs to enhance the thermal enthalpy.30,33,46,47

As is well known, the phase change characteristics of PCMs are positively correlated with their crystallization characteristics.29,48 The effect of nanofillers on the crystallization of materials can be characterized by XRD. Fig. 2d presents the XRD patterns of c-PCM and PCAs, in which typical (101) and (021) diffraction peaks at about 19.2°and 23.3° (2θ) are observed for all of the specimens. The data of these patterns are also summarized in Table S3.† In Fig. 2d, however, the (001) diffraction peak of GO (seeing Fig. S3†) decreases significantly to an almost undetectable level. It is possible that the regular layered structure of GO has been destroyed due to the abundant intercalation/adsorption of m-PEGMA.49 It is worth noting that the intensities of diffraction peaks of PCAs are clearly higher than those of c-PCM. Moreover, the intensities of diffraction peaks of PCA3 are observed to be the highest by comparison, which is consistent with the DSC results. Numerous studies indicate that the strength of the diffraction peak is proportional to the crystallinity.50 Herein, GO as a nucleating agent can induce the crystallization of m-PEGMA,51 which allows the heterogeneous nucleation mode to replace the homogeneous one and significantly decreases the free energy of nucleation (energy barrier), allowing the molecular chains to attach to and be orderly arranged on the nucleating agent.52 The complete crystallization and a large crystal grain size can lead to the diffraction peak being strong, sharp and symmetrical.49,50 Therefore, the crystalline properties of PCAs have been obviously improved compared to those of c-PCM. Based on our previous studies,48,53 the enthalpy efficiency (χ) was calculated and the corresponding results are also listed in Table 1. The ΔHm and χ curves of PCAs are plotted in Fig. 2e. Although the ΔHm and χ of PCAs display a tendency to increase first and then decrease later with the increase of the addition of GO, the ΔHm and χ of all PCAs are still higher than those of c-PCM. Compared to those of c-PCM, the ΔHm and χ of PCA3 are increased by 23 J g−1 and 18.2%, respectively. Consequently, the obstinate problem of enthalpy degradation in the use of PCMs has been well overcome. Furthermore, the χ value of PCA3 is much higher than the reported results, as shown in Fig. 2f.13,21,26,30,32,54 The relevant detailed data are also summarized in Table S4.† Both the DSC results and XRD results revealed the synergistic effect in m-PEGMA/GO PCAs fabricated by the one-pot hydrothermal reaction.
3.3. Thermal reliability, structural stability, and shape-stabilized properties of PCAs
To meet the requirement of thermal stability in the application of PCMs, the thermal stability of PCA3, as a sample, has been investigated with 100 thermal cycles. Fig. 3a shows the DSC curves of PCA3 before and after 100 thermal cycles, and the thermal data from DSC analysis are summarized in Table S5.† It is worth noting that little change is observed in both the endothermal and exothermal curves before and after 100 thermal cycles, and the differences in both the phase transition temperature and thermal enthalpy are negligible after 100 thermal cycles. Moreover, after 100 thermal cycles, the structural stability of the PCAs was further investigated by FT-IR. The FT-IR spectra shown in Fig. 3b demonstrate the same characteristic band positions as those obtained after 1 thermal cycle. Therefore, the PCAs exhibit excellent thermal reliability and structural stability.
 Fig. 3  Thermal reliability and shape-stabilized properties of PCAs. (a) DSC curves of PCA3 and (b) FT-IR spectra of PCA3 before and after 100 thermal cycles, and (c) photographs of c-PCM and PCAs before and after thermal treatment in an oven (80 °C, 30 min). 
Shape-stabilized properties are considered another important parameter of PCMs, which can prevent leakage and broaden their applications.32Fig. 3c displays the photographs of c-PCM and PCAs before and after thermal treatment (80 °C for 30 min). This thermal treatment temperature (80 °C) is much higher than the phase change temperature of m-PEGMA (nearly 45 °C). As displayed in Fig. 3c, the PCAs have better shape-stabilized properties in comparison with c-PCM. In particular, no significant change and nearly no leakage phenomenon is observed in PCA3. However, a different level of leakage is observed for PCA1, PCA2, PCA4, PCA5 and PCA6. For PCA1 and PCA2, this is mainly because the loading of GO is too small to maintain the shape stability. For PCA4, PCA5 and PCA6, this is mainly due to the excessive loading of GO. Excess GO nanosheets in the reaction system are easy to stack, which affects the grafting reaction between m-PEGMA molecules and GO lamellae that can be verified from the above Raman spectra (Fig. 1d). In Fig. 1d, it can be further seen that, with the increasing loading of GO, the m-PEGMA molecules grafted to each GO lamella decrease gradually, which results in the low interaction between m-PEGMA and GO nanosheets. Therefore, the shape-stabilized properties of PCA3 exceed those of PCA4, PCA5, and PCA6.48 Meanwhile, this is also one of the reasons why the thermal enthalpy of PCA4, PCA5, and PCA6 decreases gradually. In addition, as shown in Fig. S4,† the residual mass percentage of PCA3 is still as high as 93.7%, even after thermal treatment for 30 min at a temperature (100 °C) far higher than the phase change temperature of m-PEGMA (nearly 45 °C). Consequently, the addition of an appropriate amount of GO can improve the shape-stabilized properties of PCAs and thus can overcome the drawback of m-PEGMA solid–liquid PCM leakage.
3.4. Solar–thermal–electric energy conversion
To investigate solar–thermal–electric energy conversion, a stable simulation solar source was employed as the light source to facilitate the comparison of increased temperature and electric output between PCA-loaded TEGs and the blank one (a commercial TEG). Fig. 4a displays the TEG device diagram for solar–thermal–electric energy conversion. The energy conversion and storage of the TEG device based on PCAs can be realized by illuminating under simulated solar light at a constant intensity (200 mW cm−2, for the selection of solar light irradiation intensity refer to ESI Note 1†). The temperature variation of PCAs and the electric characteristic evolution of TEG devices are recorded using a handheld digital thermometer and Keithley electrometer, respectively. For comparison, the TEG without PCAs was selected as the blank one. As shown in Fig. 4b and c, the temperature of PCA3 (hot side of the TEG device) is higher by nearly 20 °C than that of the blank one under 200 mW cm−2 solar light, which reveals that the introduction of PCAs can increase the ΔT between the hot side and cold side in the TEG device. Meanwhile, the voltage and current output of the PCA3-loaded TEG device are also higher than those of the blank one. The higher ΔT leads to the more outstanding performance of the TEG device.10,11 Based on the above-mentioned formula (1), the maximum thermal-to-electricity conversion efficiency (ηTEG) of the PCA3-loaded TEG device and the blank one can be calculated to be 9.34% and 5.79%, respectively. The detailed calculation process can be found in the ESI.† In contrast to the blank one, the ηTEG of the PCA3-loaded TEG device was enhanced by around 61.3%. For the blank TEG, the direct thermal effect of solar light leads to low increasing of temperature and output of the voltage and current. Once the solar light is turned off, the rising temperature drops sharply to room temperature, and the voltage and current output immediately decrease to nearly zero, as illustrated in Fig. 4b. However, for the PCA3-loaded TEG, the slopes of T–t, V–t and I–t curves gradually become gentle until an inflection point appears and then the temperature, V and I start to rise rapidly again, as shown in Fig. 4c, indicating the occurrence of solid–liquid phase change and thermal energy storage. After removing the solar light source, the V and I drop immediately in a similar manner to the T–t curves shown in Fig. 4c; however, another buffer platform begins to emerge in each curve due to the release of stored thermal energy to maintain the temperature during the solidification of PCAs. Therefore, it is a unique feature of PCAs that the heat storage capacity of the m-PEGMA units delay the thermal response, which enables the PCAs to sustain the heat output across the TEG device. Despite solar radiation in nature being periodically accessible, the PCA-loaded TEGs still enable sustainable voltage and current outputs because the heat accumulated in PCAs can be released for thermoelectric generation during the “dark” period. Fig. 4c also simultaneously displays the T–t, V–t and I–t curves of the PCA3-loaded TEG in three successive cycles, and the voltage/current output of the PCA3-loaded TEG in more than three cycles is exhibited in Fig. S5 and S6.† In comparison, the voltage and current output of the PCA3-loaded TEG remain nearly unchanged during each cycle. Meanwhile, the PCAs exhibit excellent thermal reliability and structural stability in the thermal cycle test, as mentioned above. Therefore, it is not difficult to deduce that PCA-loaded TEGs can sustainably generate electric energy in periods with no solar irradiation. Moreover, Fig. 4d displays the contrast diagram of electrical properties between the PCA3-loaded TEG and the blank one. Compared to those of the blank one, the maximum outputs of voltage, current and power of the PCA3-loaded TEG are about 144 mV, 14.8 mA, and 2.13 mW,55,56 respectively, which are increased by about 200%, 170% and 710%. Furthermore, the voltage output of the PCA3-loaded TEG is much higher than that in similar reported literature (Fig. S7†). The TEG with enhanced thermoelectric performance will be widely applied in artificial intelligence, self-powered sensing systems, clean energy renewal, waste heat reuse and other fields.

Inspired by PCAs with high thermal energy storage density and PCA-loaded TEGs with enhanced solar–thermal–electric energy conversion, proof-of-concept experiments were performed using a measurement system composed of PCA-loaded TEGs, a hot platform, and an ice-water mixture to simulate the recovery and reuse of surplus heat and industrial waste heat.57Fig. 5a displays the thermoelectric characteristic measurement system of PCA-loaded TEGs. Firstly, the PCA3 and PCA4 were encapsulated on the side of commercial TEGs, which are marked as TEG1 and TEG2. Secondly, the side of the as-encapsulated TEGs with PCAs used as the hot side was heated to about 80 °C and then transferred quickly from the hot stage. To obtain a relatively large temperature difference (ΔT), a mixture of ice-water was used as the cold side of TEGs. Lastly, the ice bags containing the ice–water mixture were placed on TEGs transferred from the hot stage. Meanwhile, the real-time voltage output were recorded using a Keithley 6514. As shown in Fig. 5b, the step-voltage output can be observed when connecting two PCA-loaded TEGs in series. Moreover, the output electricity generated by TEG1 and TEG2 in series were also applied to light up commercial LEDs, power various portable electronic gadgets, and charge several capacitors. During lighting up the LEDs using TEG1 and TEG2 in series, the V–t curve was also recorded and the equivalent circuit is shown in the inset of Fig. 5c. In particular, eighty green LEDs can be gradually lit up and the high brightness can remain for quite a long time, as seen in Fig. 5d and Video 1.† In previous relevant studies, only one LED lamp was lit.57–59 However, in this study, the PCA-loaded TEGs can not only light up eighty green LEDs, but also instantly drive a wristwatch, commercial digital calculator, and commercial hygrothermograph, as seen in Fig. 5e, S8 and Videos 2–4.† To store the electricity generated by the TEG, different capacitors were charged, and the corresponding charging curves are shown in Fig. 5f. The saturation voltages of charged capacitors of 2.2–33 μF were quickly achieved within 10 seconds due to large output current of TEGs. Consequently, a series of successful applications of the PCA-loaded TEGs can be achieved by lighting up LEDs, powering various portable electronic gadgets, and charging commercial capacitors.

In order to intuitively verify the enhanced characteristics of PCA-loaded TEGs, a contrast experiment was carried out for two TEGs with and without PCAs. As illustrated in Fig. 5c, in the initial stage the maximum output voltages generated by the two above-mentioned TEGs were nearly the same. When removing the heat source, the time taken for the output voltage to drop to 0.5 V is 55 and 180 s, respectively. The delay of the output-dropping time is attributed to the thermal energy storage properties of PCAs, which enable sustainable output electricity from the PCA-loaded TEGs. Fig. S9† shows the voltage difference (ΔV)–time (t) curve of LEDs powered by the PCA-loaded TEGs and the blank one, where the maximum value of ΔV is up to 1.74 V. Furthermore, the sustainable lighting time of the eighty green LEDs directly powered by PCA-loaded TEGs (80 seconds) is about 4 times longer than that of the blank one (20 seconds), as seen in Video 5.† Consequently, the PCA-loaded TEGs can enable sustained power supply capability when there is no solar light illumination or the heat source is removed and demonstrate that new promising application potential would be explored in advanced energy-related devices and systems for solar energy utilization and storage, self-powered sensing systems, waste heat reuse and other fields.
4. Conclusions
Novel PCAs composed of an m-PEGMA/GO composite with a synergistic effect were fabricated by a green one-pot hydrothermal method, and they overcome the drawbacks of enthalpy degradation and leakage existing in the use of PCMs. Compared to those of c-PCM, the ΔHm and χ of PCAs are increased by 23 J g−1 and 18.2%, respectively. The PCAs exhibit excellent thermal stability, thermal reliability, and shape-stabilized properties, and have been employed to achieve highly efficient solar–thermal–electric energy conversion and storage. Under irradiation using simulated solar light, the output of the voltage and current of the PCA3-loaded TEG (∼144 mV and 14.8 mA) are approximately 3 times and 2.7 times that of the blank one (∼48 mV, 5.4 mA), respectively. The maximum thermal-to-electricity conversion efficiency (ηTEG) of the PCA3-loaded TEG is increased by about 61.3% compared to the blank one. Therefore, loading of PCAs can greatly enhance the solar thermoelectric energy conversion and storage capacity of TEGs. In particular, the sustained thermal release of the PCAs enables sustainable electric output when the solar light or the heat source is removed. Furthermore, the PCA-loaded TEGs can instantly light up commercial LEDs, power various portable electronic gadgets, and charge several different capacitors. The sustainable lighting time of eighty green LEDs directly powered by PCA-loaded TEGs is about 4 times longer than that of the blank one. Besides, the maximum value of the voltage difference (ΔV) of LEDs powered by PCA-loaded TEGs and the blank one is up to 1.74 V. Consequently, the PCAs can enable enhancement of the power supply capability of TEGs, which demonstrates that the new promising application potential would be explored in advanced energy-related devices and systems for solar energy utilization and storage, self-powered sensing systems, waste heat reuse and other fields.
