    , Accepted 12th May 2021First published on 12th May 2021AbstractOwing to their high capacity and low working potential, Si-based anodes are regarded as potential alternatives to graphite anodes to meet the higher requirements of Li-ion batteries (LIBs). However, high volume change causes the fracturing and pulverization of the bulk anode and continuous side reactions, which are more severe in large-particle Si anodes, limiting its practical application. Herein, to build a low-cost battery system, we chose a common industrial waste product, Al–Si microparticles (Al–SiMPs, ∼30 μm), as the anode for LIBs and coupled it with a 2.0 M LiFP6 2-MeTHF electrolyte to support its operation. The Al–SiMP anode showed a high specific capacity and a significantly improved electronic conductivity, ensuring high energy and power densities. An ultra-high initial coulombic efficiency (iCE) of 91.6% and a cycling CE of ∼99.9% were obtained in the half-cells, which delivered a capacity of 1300 mA h g−1 and maintained 95.3% after 100 cycles. Paired with low-cost and high-safety LiFePO4 as the cathode, the LFP||Al–SiMP full cells showed decent cycling stability and exhibited a considerable cost advantage, demonstrating a competitive solution for stationary energy storage.
1. Introduction
The increasing utilization of renewable energy, such as solar and wind energies, which will supply 10% of the global energy demand by 2023, requires more reliable and low-cost large-scale stationary energy storage systems (ESSs) to ensure stable and safe output due to the inevitably intermittent nature of the energy sources.1 According to their models, some researchers believed that lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) would become the most economical carrier for large-scale stationary ESSs by 2030.2 Therefore, to meet the demand for storage of excess generated energy and the requirements of short-term peak electricity energy, further improvement of the energy density and power density of LIBs is crucial for the practical and comprehensive application of renewable energy sources. However, the cost of building large-scale stationary ESSs is also a significant factor that cannot be ignored.
Owing to their high theoretical capacity (3579 mA h g−1 at room temperature), which is about ten times that of the graphite anode in commercial LIBs, silicon (Si)-based anodes exhibit promise for LIBs with higher energy density.3,4 As Si is one of the most abundant elements in the earth's crust, its simple mining and fabrication process (for battery grade) bring great cost advantages. However, the large volume change (∼280% for Li3.75Si) during (de)lithiation causes the fracturing and pulverization of the bulk anode, which lead to the continuous generation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and destructive parasitic reactions on the fresh surface.5–9 Continuous consumption of the limited electrolyte and detachment of the pulverized electrode cause the low reversibility of Si-based anodes, particularly microsized ones. Therefore, in conventional ethylene carbonate (EC)-based electrolytes, which are extensively used in state-of-art LIBs based on a graphite anode, extremely poor cycling stability with low coulombic efficiency (CE) was observed for large (>10 μm) Si microparticles.10
To meet the requirements for practical utilization of LIBs with Si-based anodes, extensive work has been performed to improve their electrochemical performance. Fabricating nano-scale particles, such as nanowires,11,12 nanotubes,13 nanoporous structures14 and core–shell nanostructures, can mitigate the pulverization of the bulk electrode and effectively shorten the diffusion path of Li+.15,16 Carbon-coated Si nanoparticles,17 silicon carbide (SiC),18,19 SiC/MXenes20 and Si/functional matrix21 anodes showed increased electronic conductivity and structural stabilization, leading to better cycling reversibility. However, hybrid structures require complex preparation processes, leading to a much higher cost. In addition, the reduced particle size enlarges the specific surface area and decreases the tap density, making them almost impossible to use in practical applications. Novel binders such as high-modulus alginate and its hydrogel,22,23 polyacrylic acid (PAA) incorporated with polyrotaxane,24 and self-healing polymers25 have been used to constrain the deformation of alloy microparticle anodes. Yet the cycling CE (up to 99.6%) is not high enough to support long-term cycling in practical applications. Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and vinylene carbonate (VC) additives were employed to build a stabilized SEI and batteries with such film-forming additives exhibit decent cycling stability using Si nanoparticles.26,27 Still, the thick and uneven SEI showed only limited improvement when the alloy anode particle size increased to micro-scale.28–30 Chen et al. developed a MixTHF electrolyte to serve the stable operation of several alloy anodes which exhibited high initial CE and cycling CE.31 They ascribed the superior cycling performance to the bilayer LiF-organic SEI with high interface energy and high mechanical strength to tolerate the large volume change. Chae et al. designed a localized high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE) using 1H,1H,5H-octafluoropentyl 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl ether (OTE) as a diluent for the operation of a Si/graphite anode. The inorganic-rich SEI that formed in the OTE-based LHCE suppressed continuous SEI growth and the corresponding half-cells showed much better long-term cycling performance than those with a commercial EC-based electrolyte.32
With the extensive investigations of Si/graphite anodes, the commercial application of Si-based anodes may be dawning. But a feasible combination of low-cost, decent cycling stability, high energy density and high power density is still difficult to find for the operation of large-scale stationary ESSs. Herein, with the premise of affecting the intrinsic advantages of Si anodes as little as possible, we picked Al–Si microparticles (Al–SiMPs) to improve the electronic conductivity for a better power density and to guarantee a high tap density for high energy density. Al is also a commonly used anode alloy for LIBs, exhibiting a theoretical specific capacity of 993 mA h g−1 with 97% volume change for LiAl.33 Meanwhile, Si and Al are two of the most abundant elements in the earth's crust and Al–Si alloy is a common industrial waste product, so the direct utilization of the as-received Al–SiMPs ensures the low cost of anode materials. Using 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF as the electrolyte, the half-cells showed an ultra-high initial coulombic efficiency (iCE) of 91.6% and a cycling coulombic efficiency (cCE) of ∼99.9%, delivering a capacity of 1300 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 2 C and maintaining 95.3% after 100 cycles. Analysis of the results revealed that the modulated thin and compact SEI endows the Al–SiMPs with high reversibility and high rate performance. Coupled with commercial LiFePO4 as the cathode, the LFP||Al–SiMP full cells maintained ∼90% of their initial capacity after 100 cycles, making them a competitive solution for stationary energy storage.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Sample preparation
900 mg Al–SiMPs and 30 mg Super P C45 carbon black were mixed in a mortar and manually ground for about 5 minutes, then 700 mg LiPAA aqueous solution (10 wt%) was added to the powder. The anode slurry was obtained after 10 min of centrifugal homogenization and was coated evenly on copper foil with a typical loading of ∼2 mg cm−2. The cathode slurry was prepared similarly at a ratio of LFP:carbon black:LiPAA = 8:1:1 and exhibited a typical loading of ∼12 mg cm−2. We used two polyethylene (PE) separators between the lithium foil and the anode inside the half-cells in order to avoid as much as possible the micro short circuits caused by lithium dendrites. Only one piece of PE separator and ∼50 μL electrolyte were used in the LFP||Al–SiMP full cells.
2.2 Electrochemical tests
The half-cells were galvanostatically tested with cut-offs of 0.01–0.8 V for the 1st cycle and 0.05–0.8 V for the subsequent cycles. The cut-offs were 0.05–1 V for rate tests and 2.6–3.4 V for full cell tests. Similar strategies were applied in the half-cells using AlMP and SiMP anodes and the cut-off voltages were 0.1–0.8 V and 0.01–1.5 V, respectively. The current rate for GITT tests was C/15 and the cells were set with a 1 h pulse and 6 h rest. CV and EIS data were obtained on an Ivium electrochemical workstation. All the cells were placed in a 25 °C incubator during the above electrochemical tests.
2.3 Materials characterization
We used an X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical, Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation for the XRD measurements. SEM (Hitachi SU-70) and EDX were used to observe the microstructure and element distribution. TEM (Tecnai G2 F30) was used for the observation of the SEI. We used a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi with an Al Ka X-ray source for the XPS spectra. For the ICP-OES test, 100 mg Al–SiMPs was added to 20 mL of 20 wt% NaOH solution. After dissolution was complete, the solution was acidified by adding 12 mL HNO3. The resulting solution was diluted to 500 mL with DI water and filtered before testing on an ICPE-9000.
2.4 Materials characterization
Fig. S1† shows one of the parts of the GITT test. When a current pulse is applied, the voltage of the cell shows a rapid decrease because of the bulk resistance. As the current continues, the potential of the cell decreases slowly due to the transport of Li+ in the solid phase. When the current is removed, the voltage increases as the Li+ concentration evenly distributes throughout the solid phase. The GITT diffusivity formula is given as (1)
in which nM is the molar mass, VM is the molar volume of the Al–Si micropowder, ΔVs = V0 − V3 and ΔVt = V1 − V2, S is the cell interfacial area, and τ represents the time duration of the pulse. We assume that the Al–Si micropowders have a radius of ∼30 μm. (2)
The DLi+ values can be calculated by the above formula.
3. Results and discussion
As Fig. 1a shows, as-received Al–SiMPs were directly used as raw materials in the slurry for the anode. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping (EDS) results (Fig. 1b) show some enrichment of Si inside Al–SiMPs. The XRD pattern (Fig. 1c) demonstrates that the peaks of electrode materials matched well with those of Si (JCPDS no. 27-1402) and Al (JCPDS no. 04-0787). The particle sizes of Al–SiMPs range from 15 to 35 μm with an average diameter of ∼30 μm (Fig. 1d). The chemical composition obtained by ICP-OES (Fig. 1f) shows that Al–SiMPs consist of 32.1 wt% Si, 67.7 wt% Al and 0.2 wt% impurities, which include Fe, Cu, Pb, etc. The compacted Al–SiMPs showed an electrical conductivity significantly improved by 103 to 104 (Fig. 1e) at various pressures compared with SiMPs, indicating a much better rate performance.

Given the strong PF6−⋯Li+ binding energy and the reduced solvation ability, which indicate more contact ion pairs, we chose 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF for subsequent investigations (ESI notes 1 and 2†).31,34–37 As Fig. 2a shows, the anode with the ∼2 mg cm−2 Al–SiMPs loading provided a high specific capacity of ∼2.6 mA h cm−2 and ∼1300 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 2 C (1 C means charge or discharge in one hour) in 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF electrolyte. There was a very large overpotential of ∼0.11 V in the first discharge process (as shown in the illustration of Fig. S2†) due to the large particle size and the thick oxide layer on the anode. As a result, the first two (de)lithiation processes were set at a current density of 0.1 C and a cut-off voltage of 0.01 V for full activation of Al–SiMPs, preventing the incomplete discharge triggered by a large overpotential. From the 3rd cycle, the current rate was adjusted to 2 C for cells with 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF electrolyte and well-overlapping voltage profiles were realized from then on, indicating a high reversibility. The iCE was 91.6% while the cCE reached ∼99.9% at the 5th cycle and subsequently showed little change. After 100 cycles at 2 C, ∼95.3% capacity was maintained (taking the 3rd discharge capacity as 100%), demonstrating almost no active material loss. When using the commercial carbonate-based electrolyte (1.0 M LiPF6 EC/dimethyl carbonate (DMC)) for comparison, the half-cells were operated at 0.1 C from the beginning to the end because these cells almost could not operate when the current rate increased to 2 C. Al–SiMPs in 1.0 M LiPF6 EC/DMC exhibited a relatively low initial CE of 83.5% and a continuously declining cycling CE from the 3rd cycle (Fig. S3†). The specific capacity suffered rapid decay, with ∼70% of the capacity lost in 30 cycles and only ∼4% of the capacity remaining after 60 cycles. The specific capacity increase during the first 10 cycles, which was more obvious in the EC/DMC-based electrolyte, was ascribed to the insufficient wettability of Al–SiMPs by the electrolytes.38 The cycling performances of pure AlMPs (Fig. S4†) and pure SiMPs (Fig. S5†) were also obtained in 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF electrolyte and carbonate electrolyte. Both anodes exhibited a high iCE and decent cycling stability in the 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF, suggesting the excellent compatibility of the 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF electrolyte with Al and Si anodes. Meanwhile, as Fig. 2b shows, the rate performance of Al–SiMPs in 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF electrolyte was significantly improved compared with that in 1.0 M LiPF6 EC/DMC electrolyte. Al–SiMPs exhibited 1653.9, 1632.7, 1546.5, 1350.6 and 1074.6 mA h g−1 at current rates of 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, 2 C and 5 C, respectively. In comparison, in the 1.0 M LiPF6 EC/DMC electrolyte, when the current rate increased to 2 C, only 660.8 mA h g−1 was maintained. When the current rate further increased to 10 C, 727.1 mA h g−1, only ∼44% of the capacity obtained at 0.2 C, was realized in 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF. The specific capacity was well maintained when the current rate returned to the initial level, indicating that high current density causes little damage to the electrode in 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF electrolyte. The relatively low ionic conductivity of 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF (2.83 mS cm−1, Fig. S6a†) compared with that of 1.0 M LiPF6 EC/DMC (11.70 mS cm−1) showed little disadvantage in the rate performance at room temperature. We ascribe the impressive capacity retention at high current rates to the dramatically decreased SEI resistance (RSEI, the semicircle at low frequencies, 22.1 Ω vs. 130.3 Ω) and charge-transfer resistance (Rct, the semicircle at high frequencies, 26.9 Ω vs. 190.9 Ω), which are shown in Fig. S6b.† Meanwhile, due to the greatly improved electronic conductivity compared to that of SiMPs, much higher capacities were maintained in high current densities (Fig. S6c†).

(e) Calculated diffusion coefficients at various states of lithiation. 
The electrochemical behaviour of Al–SiMPs in 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF electrolyte was further investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. 2c and Fig. S7a†). There are two discharge and three charge peaks in the first scan derived from the CV profiles of Al–SiMPs, which are denoted as D2, D3, and C1–C3. A new cathodic peak emerges at ∼0.3 V from the second cycle and is marked as D1. During the first lithiation, the reduction peak (D2) at ∼0.15 V indicates the alloying of LiAl, while D3 at ∼0.1 V indicates the formation of crystal Li15Si4.39,40 During the delithiation process, the oxidation peaks C1 at ∼0.35 V and C2 at ∼0.5 V suggest the extraction of Li+, generating amorphous LixSi and amorphous Si, respectively. The last peak, C3, indicates the transformation from LiAl to Al. In the second discharge curve, the additional peak D1 is assigned to the conversion of amorphous Si to amorphous LixSi compounds. All the redox peaks (D1–D3, C1–C3) are also reflected in the CV curves of pure AlMPs and pure SiMPs (Fig. S8†). At the same scan rate, the various peaks in the CV profiles obtained from carbonate-based electrolyte (Fig. S7b†) show more overlap, indicating that the overall resistance inside the battery is much higher.
Theoretically, when different scan rates are exerted in the same cell, certain voltammetric responses will be observed, which can be generalized as41i = avbwhere i indicates the current obtained at each peak and v is the corresponding scan rate. The various rate-controlling steps in cells, including semi-infinite diffusion and capacitive process, can be indicated by the value of b: 0.5 for the former and 1 for the latter. By linear fitting the log (ipeak) vs. log (v) for every peak, as shown in Fig. 2c and Fig. S9a–f,† the b-values of the redox peaks of Al (D2, C3) and Si at relatively high potential (D1, C2) are found to be close to 0.5, indicating that these processes are typical diffusion-controlled alloying process, while the redox peaks of Si at a potential close to 0 V (D3, C1) showed more capacitive characteristics. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) is a common method for investigating the thermodynamic behavior inside batteries.42 The thermodynamic potential hysteresis of Al–SiMPs cycled in 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF electrolyte was ∼0.09 V (Fig. 2d), lower than the ∼0.14 V of conventional carbonate-based electrolyte (Fig. S10†). The Li+ diffusion coefficient (DLi+) indicates the rate of Li+ intercalation inside the electrode and influences the overall battery performance.43 Its measurement by GITT is convenient to implement and the results for DLi+ at different states of lithiation are displayed in Fig. 2e. DLi+ in Al–SiMPs ranges from 2.12 × 10−14 cm2 s−1 to 1.72 × 10−10 cm2 s−1. With the continuous increase of lithium content and formation of LiAl, DLi+ decreased until the conversion was complete (∼40% SOC).44 With further lithiation processes and the formation of Li-Si compound, DLi+ returns to a magnitude of 10−12 to 10−10 and exhibits “W” type behavior, with two minimum regions at Li2.1±0.2Si and Li3.2±0.2Si.45
In order to clarify the outstanding electrochemical behavior of Al–SiMPs in 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF electrolyte, we conducted further studies on the electrolyte and the SEI. Fig. 3a shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results with Ar+ etching of Al–SiMPs cycled in our electrolyte. On the very top surface of the SEI, both organic and inorganic signals were detected. However, as the etching continued, the content of C decreased rapidly and the signals of C 1s (an indicator of organic components and some inorganic components such as Li2CO3) were almost undetectable after 300 s of etching, indicating an ultra-thin organic layer in the SEI. In the Si 2p spectra, Li4SiO4 and amorphous Si compound signals dominate and the Li4SiO4 signal reaches its maximum at 300–600 s. In the Al 2p spectra, LiAlO2 and Al are the main originators of signals and the signal of LiAlO2 remains high for 1500 s of etching, possibly originating from the thick oxide film on the surface of the Al component in pristine Al–SiMPs. The signals of Li4SiO4 and LiAlO2 are well reflected in the O 1s spectra. We find continuous strong intensity of the LiF signal in the F 1s spectra throughout the etching process, suggesting a high content of highly uniform LiF in the SEI. Due to its very low electronic conductivity and high shear modulus, the LiF-rich SEI can be very thin and possesses high mechanical strength.46–48 In addition, Li4SiO4 is regarded as an elastic structural buffer for tolerating the large volume expansion of the Si-based anode.49,50 LiAlO2 accompanied by LiF shows improved ionic conductivity and may enhance the lithium-ion mobility.51 For comparison, the chemical composition of the SEI formed in 1.0 M LiPF6 EC/DMC electrolyte is shown in Fig. 3c. It is evident that the signals of LiF showed less intensity, which means less LiF contribution to the SEI. In sharp contrast, the carbon signals, whether from organic or inorganic components, showed consistently high intensity during the 1500 s of etching, indicating a much thicker SEI. It can be further proved from the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 3b and d) that the thickness of the SEI formed in the carbonate electrolyte was ∼3.5 times that formed in the 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF electrolyte (27 nm vs. 7.7 nm). Meanwhile, there were almost no clear Al or Si signals on the top surface of the SEI before 300 s etching, which implies a thick organic component layer formed on the electrode. The lower reduction resistance of carbonates renders a much higher solvent decomposition potential than that of ethers, leading to more organic components in the SEI generated from the 1.0 M LiPF6 EC/DMC than that from the 2-MeTHF-based electrolyte.52 Using the widely accepted “mosaic model” proposed by Peled and co-workers53 that describes the SEI structure on the anode in a conventional carbonate electrolyte, there is a high likelihood that this kind of SEI is uneven in thickness and composition and unable to tolerate the great volume expansion of Al–SiMPs,30 leading to mechanical fracture and pulverization of the bulk anode. Furthermore, on the exposed fresh surface of Al–SiMPs in subsequent cycles, continuous side reactions and consumption of the limited electrolyte eventually led to poor cycling stability and the early failure of batteries.
 Fig. 3  XPS results of Al–SiMPs and the corresponding TEM images after operation in (a and b) 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF and (c and d) 1.0 M LiPF6 EC/DMC. 
Because of the high PF6−⋯Li+ bonding and decreased solvation ability in 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF, which indicate an elevated LiPF6 reduction potential prior to the addition of the ether solvent, the formation of LiF was facilitated and the decomposition of the solvent was suppressed in 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF electrolyte. The low decomposition voltage of 2-MeTHF means that the organic product will only form near the end of discharge. When the SEI on Al–SiMPs breaks during lithiation, a new LiF SEI will form on the exposed surface, rather than one of organic components. As a result, a thin and compact SEI formed when using the electrolyte 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF. A much thicker SEI can incur repeated breakage and regeneration, leading to the poor cycling performance of Al–SiMPs in cells with the electrolyte 1.0 M LiPF6 EC/DMC. Fig. S11 and S12† show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the electrode before and after cycling in half-cells with these two electrolytes. After the first discharge/charge cycle in the electrolyte 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF (Fig. S12d–f†), a porous structure emerged on the surface of delithiated Al–SiMPs, indicating almost no extra generation of SEI. As the cycling proceeded, this porous structure exhibited decent stability. Meanwhile, the integrity of bulk Al–SiMPs was maintained after five cycles (Fig. S11a†) and little pulverization or cracking was observed. In sharp contrast, after five cycles in the 1.0 M LiPF6 electrolyte, the thick hybrid SEI could not tolerate the large volume change and broke, leading to extra SEI forming and filling the gap in Al–SiMPs, leaving little space for subsequent lithiation (Fig. S12g–i†). The repeated fracturing and formation of SEI gradually led to the pulverization of bulk Al–SiMPs and the loss of active materials (Fig. S11b†). The EDS mapping results of Al–SiMPs after cycling in the two electrolytes are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The distributions of Al, Si, O, P and F were uniform and similar on the surface of Al–SiMPs in both electrolytes. Yet the content of C in the 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF electrolyte showed very a low intensity when compared with other elements which further confirmed our conclusion that there is a very low organic component contribution to the SEI.

The EIS results from the half-cells at various open circuit voltages (OCVs) during the first lithiation process are shown in Fig. S13a and b.† The semicircle at high frequencies represents the RSEI. A sharp decrease was observed around 1.1–1.3 V, which indicates the initial reduction of LiPF6 and preliminary SEI generation. With the growth of the SEI, its resistance showed a gradual decrease in the potential region of 1.1 to 0.4 V. RSEI was mainly influenced by two opposite effects in the third region between 0.4–0.2 V: (1) the consistent formation of a conductive SEI, leading to decreased RSEI, and (2) the expansion of Al–SiMPs, resulting in increased RSEI.54 The latter effect obviously dominated the process in the third region. In the last region between 0.006–0.1 V, though the expansion of Al–SiMPs continued, the decomposition of the ether solvent improved the conductivity of the SEI, leading to a drop in RSEI by an order magnitude.
The electrochemical performance of full cells with Al–SiMPs in the electrolyte 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF was tested with low-cost and high-safety LiFePO4 (LFP) as the cathode. Cycling stabilities of the half-cells using an LFP cathode with 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF electrolyte are shown in Fig. S14† and exhibit decent performance at a rate of 0.2 C. Similarly to the Al–SiMPs anode, the LFP cathode was used directly without any pretreatment. As shown in Fig. 5a, full cells with 2.0 M LiPF6 2-MeTHF electrolyte maintained ∼90% of their initial capacity after 100 cycles. It can be seen in Fig. 5b that there was no apparent overpotential increase as the cycles proceeded, suggesting good compatibility between the electrode and electrolyte. When the carbonate electrolytes were applied to the full cells, as shown in Fig. 5c, the overpotential increased rapidly with the increasing number of operation cycles. Therefore, poor cycling performances were obtained in the EC/DMC electrolyte with and without FEC additives, though the FEC additive did help during the first few several cycles.

We compared the costs of several common anodes and cathodes for LIBs from recent market research. Undeniably, graphite, as the most successful anode material in the industrial field, shows a great cost advantage (Fig. 5d). However, when capacity is taken into consideration, its relative advantage is weakened and the result demonstrates that Al–SiMPs, graphite, and microsized Si exhibit similar capacity costs. The complex fabrication process and relatively immature technology limit the practical large-scale application of Si/graphite and nanosized Si. But we firmly believe that with the further development of battery materials, the costs will gradually reduce and the overall advantage of Al–SiMP anodes will be more evident. Meanwhile, as Fig. 5e shows, the cost advantage of LFP among several cathode materials is obvious despite its relatively low working potential. The cost per kW h (only considering the cathode) of LFP is almost half that of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) and is much lower than those of LiCoO2 (LCO) and LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA), not to mention its unparalleled safety compared with other cathode materials.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we report a promising solution for the practical application of Si-based anodes in LIBs, resulting in a feasible combination of low cost, decent cycling stability and high power density. To build a low-cost battery system, we chose a common industrial waste product, Al–Si microparticles (Al–SiMPs, ∼30 μm), as the anode for LIBs and coupled it with the electrolyte 2.0 M LiFP6 2-MeTHF to support its operation. The Al–SiMPs anode showed a high specific capacity and significantly improved electronic conductivity, ensuring high energy density and power density. An ultra-high initial coulombic efficiency (iCE) of 91.6% and a cycling CE of ∼99.9% were obtained in half-cells that delivered a capacity of 1300 mA h g−1 and maintained 95.3% after 100 cycles. Paired with low-cost and high-safety LiFePO4 as the cathode, the LFP||Al–SiMP full cells showed decent cycling stability and exhibited a considerable cost advantage, demonstrating a competitive solution for stationary energy storage.
