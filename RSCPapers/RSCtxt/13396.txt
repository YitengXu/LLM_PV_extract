    , Accepted 25th February 2015First published on 3rd March 2015AbstractHighly efficient tree branch-shaped CuO photocathodes are fabricated using the hybrid microwave annealing process with a silicon susceptor within 10 minutes. The unique hierarchical, one-dimensional structure provides more facile charge transport, larger surface areas, and increased crystallinity and crystal ordering with less defects compared to irregular-shaped CuO prepared by conventional thermal annealing. As a result, the photocathode fabricated with the tree branch-shaped CuO produces an unprecedently high photocurrent density of −4.4 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight compared to −1.44 mA cm−2 observed for a photocathode fabricated by thermal annealing. It is also confirmed that stoichiometric hydrogen and oxygen are produced from photoelectrochemical water splitting on the tree branch-shaped CuO photocathode and a platinum anode.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen production from photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is an attractive way to make solar energy storable, transportable and usable on demand as a fuel. Although water splitting has been intensively investigated since the concept was introduced,1 many challenges still remain unresolved for practical applications. The requirements for semiconductor photoelectrode materials include a suitable band gap to absorb ample sunlight, appropriate band alignment to split water and good conductivity to extract photogenerated holes and electrons without recombination. Furthermore, for large scale hydrogen production, materials should be inexpensive, made of earth-abundant elements and durable in aqueous solutions.
Cupric oxide (CuO) is an attractive cathode material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting due to its narrow band gap (1.44–1.68 eV) suitable for absorbing a large portion of the solar spectrum, at a low cost, and is nontoxic.2 Moreover, it has an appropriate band alignment for water reduction with a conduction band edge of −3.66 eV with respect to the vacuum, which is negative enough potential to produce hydrogen from water.3 However, the poor conductivity and the short electron diffusion length (100–200 nm) hamper charge transport and separation within the semiconductor, increasing the probability of recombination and photo-corrosion. Many approaches have been investigated to overcome this problem of photo-generated charge recombination to enhance photocatalytic or PEC performance such as high crystallinity with a low defect density, large surface area and low dimensional nanoscopic morphology.4
Various fabrication methods for CuO have been reported such as spray pyrolysis, metal–organic chemical vapor deposition, solid state reaction and so on.2,5–7 However, these techniques have drawbacks of long fabrication time, low purity CuO phase, many defect sites, and limited product morphology. Here, we report a hybrid microwave annealing (HMA) method to fabricate a unique tree branch-shaped CuO photocathode in a few minutes, which could replace the conventional annealing process. It is well known that microwave induces rapid heating by direct interaction with atoms or molecules of the material, and microwave-assisted synthetic methods have the advantage of a shortened reaction time and reduced by-product formation. But a non-uniform temperature profile between the interior and exterior of the material is a serious drawback.8 The HMA technique combines indirect heating from an external heat source called a susceptor and direct heating from microwave. As a result, it is effective for most materials including non-conducting insulators and provides temperature uniformity through the material with an extremely short operating time.8–10 Thus, in this work, HMA treatment produced the unique tree branch-shaped CuO with a large surface area and reduced defect sites compared to irregularly shaped CuO prepared by conventional thermal annealing. The CuO photocathode of the unique morphology produced an unprecedently high cathodic photocurrent of −4.4 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight at 0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in PEC water reduction.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Electrode fabrication
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the CuO electrode was fabricated by a two-step process. In the first step, the mixed Cu–Cu oxide (CuxO) composite was electrodeposited on the F:SnO2 (FTO) surface from 0.1 M Cu(NO3)2 (99.9% Junsei Chemical). The Cu–CuxO (denoted as ‘Cu FTO’) was deposited at an optimized, constant potential of 5 V, which was applied between the two FTO electrodes for 5 min using a DC power supply at room temperature. In the second step, the electrodeposited Cu FTO was oxidized by microwave heating treatment without any susceptor (denoted ‘MA CuxO’). The tree branch-shaped CuO electrode was obtained from Cu FTO by microwave heating treatment with silicon as a susceptor (denoted as ‘HMA CuO’) as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The home microwave oven provides a power of 800 W at 2.45 GHz. The electrodeposited Cu FTO composite was moved onto the silicon wafer (n-type, Silicon Technology Corporation) used as a susceptor, then the microwave reaction proceeded for 10 minutes. The temperature of the synthetic system increased up to almost 400 °C during HMA treatment. The electrodepositions were carried out at various voltages and the morphologies and photoresponses of final HMA CuO are presented in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†). The 5 V provided the optimum HMA CuO electrode giving the most suitable morphology and the best PEC performance. For comparison, the CuO electrode was also fabricated by conventional heating of electrodeposited Cu FTO at 400 °C in a muffle furnace (denoted as ‘CAL CuO’).

2.2 Characterization
The morphology of the electrode was characterized using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (HRSEM, JSM-7401F, JEOL) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2200 with image Cs-corrector, JEOL). The crystalline structure and characteristics were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, PW3040/60 X'pert PRO, PANalytical, with Cu-Kα (λ = 1.43056 Å) radiation). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi) measurement was used to confirm the surface state of the electrode. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements were conducted on 7D beamline of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PLS-II, 3.0 GeV) in Korea. The radiation was monochromatized using a Si(111) double crystal monochromator. The spectra for the K-edge of Cu (E0 = 8979 eV) were taken in fluorescence mode at room temperature. The incident beam was detuned by 20% in order to minimize contamination of higher harmonics and its intensity was monitored using a He-filled IC Spec ionization chamber. The fluorescence signal from the sample was measured under an atmosphere of helium with a PIPS (Passivated Implanted Planar Silicon) detector. ATHENA in the IFEFFIT suite of programs was used to analyze the obtained data for the study of the local structure of CuO in the electrode.11
2.3 (Photo)electrochemical measurements
The PEC performance of the electrodes was measured in a 3-electrode system under back-side illumination from a solar simulator (91-160, Oriel) with an air mass 1.5 G filter. The simulated light intensity was calibrated to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) using a reference guaranteed by National Renewable Energy Laboratories, U.S. The Ag/AgCl electrode in saturated KCl was used as a reference electrode and Pt mesh was used as a counter electrode. The electrolyte was 0.5 M Na2SO4 at pH 6. The photo-activity of the CuO photocathode was measured under chopped illumination for observing the photo-response under the dark and light conditions simultaneously. A potentiostat (IviumStat, Ivium Technologies) was used to apply an external bias potential to the system and the scan rate for the linear sweep voltammetry was 10 mV s−1. The evolved hydrogen and oxygen gases from PEC water splitting were detected by gas chromatography with TCD (HP 7890, molecular sieves 5Å column, Ar carrier gas).
Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was carried out on the same 3-electrode system using a 300 W Xe lamp (66 905, Oriel Instruments) with a monochromator (74-004, Oriel Cornerstone 130 1/8 m) with a bandwidth of 5 nm. To prevent λ/2 radiation originated by Bragg diffraction at the grating, a 299 nm cut-off filter was placed at the exit of the output. Potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out at 0 VRHE of DC potential and AC potential frequency range from 100000 to 0.1 Hz with 10 mV amplitude. The Z-View software (Scribner Associates Inc.) was used to fit obtained data to the corresponding equivalent circuit model. Mott–Schottky (M–S) analysis was measured from 0.5 to 0.9 VRHE DC potential with 10 kHz AC potential frequency and 10 mV amplitude under dark conditions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Fabrication and characterization of tree branch-shaped CuO photocathodes

Fig. 1 illustrates the synthesis strategy of the CuO photoelectrodes. Two FTO glasses are used as a counter electrode and a substrate onto which films of the Cu metal and Cu oxide composite (Cu–CuxO) are deposited via electroreduction with a high negative potential (5 V) according to the chemical reaction;12 Cu2+ + 2e− → Cu (s)(1)
In general, Cu is easily oxidized in water or humid air,13 and thus the surface of Cu FTO contained small amounts of Cu2O and CuO as confirmed by the deconvoluted XPS results for the Cu 2p core level as shown in Fig. 2b. Doublet peaks located at around 932.3 and 952 eV are attributed to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively, in the Cu metal. The peaks shift to 932.5 and 952.3 eV for Cu2O and 933.7 and 953.6 eV for CuO. However, the XRD pattern of the electrodeposited Cu FTO presents only Cu peaks in Fig. 2a, indicating that metallic copper is still the main crystal phase.

Cu–CuxO in Cu FTO turns to different phases and morphologies upon different annealing processes. Conventional annealing in the muffler furnace at 400 °C produced the monoclinic phase of CuO (JCPDS no. 01-089-2529) as shown by XRD in Fig. 2a. Below 300 °C, oxidation of Cu was incomplete and Cu and Cu2O phases were observed as already reported.14,15 Conventional microwave annealing (MA CuxO) yields mixed phases of Cu (JCPDS no. 01-085-1326) and Cu2O (JCPDS no. 01-078-2076) as observed by using XRD in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Also the XRD patterns of SnO2 (JCPDS no. 01-077-0452) were observed as a substrate. The temperature of the system during the MA process determined by an IR thermometer laser gun was only 130 °C. As mentioned, this low temperature was not enough to oxidize Cu–Cu2O to CuO.
For HMA treatment, we first tried graphite as a susceptor. It took only 30 seconds to convert Cu–Cu2O completely to CuO, but HMA for 20 seconds gave pure Cu2O (Fig. S5†). As shown in Fig. S6,† the system temperature increased over 700 °C with graphite as a susceptor. When silicon was used as a susceptor instead of graphite, the temperature increased to ca. 400 °C and a longer reaction time (∼10 min) was needed to form pure CuO, but control was easier. The XRD pattern of the HMA film with a silicon susceptor shows pure CuO without any Cu or Cu2O impurities in Fig. 2a. By reducing the power of the microwave by 80%, the Cu2O phase can also be obtained (Fig. S7†). The peak intensity of HMA CuO is much sharper and higher than that of CAL CuO formed at 400 °C, indicating better crystallinity of HMA CuO. The amounts of deposited CuO could also be controlled by regulating the duration in the electrodeposition step. The XPS result of Cu 2p analysis also reveals that single phase CuO is fabricated by HMA treatment in Fig. 2c. In addition to the two peaks at 933.7 and 953.6 eV due to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, the two satellite peaks are observed at around 942 and 962 eV for Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 from an unfilled 3d9 shell of copper.16
X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis is an element specific, low concentration-sensitive, and local bulk structure-determining probe. The Cu K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) in Fig. 3a reflects an electric dipole transition from the 1s core level to unoccupied p states. Both HMA CuO and CAL CuO samples exhibit similar spectra to reference CuO, but a distinct shoulder is observed at 8979–8984 eV for the CAL CuO electrode. Considering that the absorption-rising position is shifted to a lower energy as the oxidation state decreases from +2 to zero, the shoulder could be compared with a reference Cu2O spectrum. The XANES feature of Cu2O at 8979–8984 eV is matched with the shoulder in terms of energy position. The existence of Cu+ in CAL CuO is more clearly visible by their derivative spectra in Fig. S8 of ESI.† HMA CuO shows two peaks in 8976–8986 eV; a tiny peak at 8977 eV is due to a quadrupole transition of 1s→3d observed only for Cu2+ materials having an unfilled d-orbital (d9) and the other intense peak at 8983 eV corresponds to the dipole transition for the Cu2+ state. However, CAL CuO has three peaks; one tiny peak at 8977 eV, another strong peak at 8981 eV (peak position of reference Cu2O) and the other intense peak at 8983 eV. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra in Fig. 3b do not show any significant difference when the samples are compared with the reference CuO in powder. The minor difference is increase in the intensities of the peaks at 0.9–2.8 Å. It is due to the enhanced ordering of the nearest Cu–O and Cu–Cu bonds, which is generally observed for the films on substrates. With both XANES and EXAFS results, we come to the conclusion that HMA treatment converts all copper species in the electrodeposited films into the CuO phase, but CAL treatment is less effective and impure Cu2O is formed within a dominant CuO structure.
 Fig. 3  (a) Cu K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra and (b) k3-weighted Fourier transforms of Cu K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) functions for electrodeposited CuO films. The spectra for HMA and CAL treatments are compared with those of reference materials CuO, Cu2O, and Cu foil. 
Morphological characterization was performed using SEM and TEM. Fig. 4a, b show the tree branch-shaped CuO electrode treated by HMA with a silicon susceptor. The hierarchical structure is made of nanorods of 100–200 nm in diameter branching continuously away from the substrate like a pine tree. Each nanorod is polycrystalline made of linearly connected nanoparticles of a few 10s of nm. In comparison, the CAL CuO electrode fabricated by conventional heating in a muffle furnace, comprises irregular-shaped, aggregated CuO as presented in Fig. 4c, d. Both CuO electrodes treated by HMA and conventional calcination are polycrystalline with dominant (111) orientation in Fig. S9.† The conventional MA treatment without a susceptor could not oxidize Cu–Cu2O and maintained the initial film morphology of Cu FTO.

Now how does the HMA treatment produce the unique tree leaf-shaped morphology? The susceptor is a good microwave absorber like graphite or silicon and is rapidly heated to a high temperature upon microwave irradiation as in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The generated heat is transferred to the target material (Cu–CuxO) via the conventional heating mechanism.8,17,18 The heated target material can now absorb microwaves effectively due to the changed dielectric properties and attenuation distance at the elevated temperature. Thus a high and uniform temperature profile is obtained all over the film. At high temperatures, Cu and O atoms diffuse rapidly in the material to form copper oxide.12,19 This sudden oxidation imposes a large stress on the surface of the electrode due to an abrupt increase in the volume during the structural changes.20 One dimensional (1-D) nanostructure formation can minimize the dramatic surface stress among various possible morphologies.15 Indeed, this extremely fast and high local heating represents the unique feature of microwave heating including HMA. The better crystallinity of HMA CuO than CAL CuO could also be understood by the higher local temperatures than measured bulk temperatures in the HMA process. This mechanism is consistent with the morphological evolution with HMA duration as presented in Fig. S10 (ESI†). In conventional calcination, the speed of Cu diffusion is neither as fast nor as uniform throughout the Cu electrode and irregular porous morphology is obtained.
In any case, the tree branch shaped HMA CuO presents several desirable properties for efficient PEC devices compared with the CAL CuO fabricated by thermal heating. First, the unique hierarchical 1-D structure could facilitate the rapid charge transport by providing interparticle connection along the nanorod axis as well as nanorod-to-nanorod connection through branches. The facile charge transport is a most essential requirement for PEC devices. The second is high purity that minimizes the defect sites that would trap charge carriers. Finally, it provides high surface areas and pore volumes to secure easy accessibility of electrolytes to the reactive CuO sites.
3.2 Photoelectrochemical water reduction
Cupric oxide electrodes were employed as photocathodes for PEC water reduction with a Pt mesh as an anode. The electrodeposited Cu FTO electrode with a composition of Cu–CuxO has a negligible photo-response as in Fig. S11 (ESI†). Fig. 5a shows the photocurrent responses of HMA and CAL CuO photocathodes when external bias was applied under irradiation of simulated AM 1.5 G (1 sun) solar light. All the measurements were evaluated under chopped irradiation, so the dark and light current–voltage could be monitored simultaneously. The photocathodes were scanned only below 0.55 VRHE because the photocurrent showed a plateau above it. At 0 VRHE (the theoretical potential necessary for water reduction), photocurrent of the HMA CuO (−4.4 mA cm−2) was ca. 3 times as high as that of CAL CuO (−1.44 mA cm−2). The HMA CuO photocathode also showed excellent photoresponses under only visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) as in Fig. S12,† and in a highly basic 1 M KOH electrolyte as in Fig. S13 of ESI.† Table S13,7,12,21–23 in ESI† lists the photo-assisted water reduction activities based on copper oxide photocathodes reported in the literature. There are many unlisted reports that recorded very low photoactivity. It should be mentioned that the photocurrent value observed here records the highest one reported to date for copper oxide photocathodes without co-catalysts for PEC water splitting.
 Fig. 5  Photoelectrochemical performance of HMA and CAL CuO photocathodes: (a) photocurrent density (J) and applied potential (V), (b) incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE), (c) potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with an equivalent circuit model in the inset, and (d) Mott–Schottky plot. 
Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured for the CuO photocathodes under irradiation with a 300 W Xe lamp coupled with a monochromator, and the results are presented in Fig. 5b. For both photocathodes, IPCE value starts to increase around the incident light of 700 nm and it is coincident with the known band gap of CuO, ∼1.6 eV. Compared with the band gap of Cu2O (2.1 eV), that of CuO (1.6 eV) is much smaller indicating that it can absorb a wider solar spectrum. The HMA CuO marks higher IPCE values compared with CAL CuO over all wavelengths, indicating that the photogenerated charge transfer and its separation in HMA CuO is better than that of CAL CuO. The relative values of IPCE for HMA and CAL CuO are consistent with the photocurrent results shown in Fig. 5a.
To clarify the origin of the different PEC responses of the HMA and CAL CuO, we performed potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The EIS was measured at −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0 VRHE) under light irradiation. The Nyquist plots of CuO photocathodes are presented in Fig. 5c. The impedance value of CAL CuO is larger than that of HMA CuO indicating a poor conductivity within the electron pathway in the electrode. For detailed analysis, the EIS data were fitted to a simple equivalent circuit model of two RC circuits as in Fig. 5c made of resistance (R) and constant phase element (CPE). Each RC circuit represents an interface between the electrode and the electrolyte (R2/CPE2) or the electron pathway within the bulk of the electrode (R1/CPE1). The Rs value, the left convergence point of the Nyquist plot, represents sheet resistance in a half cell test system.24,25 The fitting results are summarized in Table S2.† In general, a large value of resistance in the RC circuit takes place at the CuO/electrolyte interface (R2/CPE2) because of the large charge transfer resistance and double layer capacitance. The CPE values of HMA CuO as an imperfect capacitor representing surface heterogeneity, roughness and so on are higher compared to CAL CuO.26,27 For the HMA CuO photocathode, both the resistances in the bulk electrode and at the interface of the electrolyte and electrode, represented as R1 and R2, respectively, are reduced by 3.7 times.
Mott–Schottky analysis is commonly performed to determine the flat band potential (Efb) of a semiconductor as presented in Fig. 5d. The tangential line in Mott–Schottky plots is described by: 1/Csc2 = (2/eεrεoN)(E − Efb − kT/e)(2)where Csc = space charge layer capacitance, e = electron charge, εr = dielectric constant, εo = permittivity of vacuum, N = the charge carrier density, and E = applied potential. Using the equation, Efb and N can be calculated from x-intercepts and slopes in the plots of Csc−2vs. applied external potentials. The negative slope indicates that these electrodes show p-type semiconductor behavior.28 The calculated value of Efb is 0.824 VRHE for HMA CuO and 0.809 VRHE for CAL CuO. There is no significant change in Efb depending on the annealing conditions because both have CuO phase. It is reported that Efb of CuO is higher than that of Cu2O by around 0.1–0.2 VRHE.29,30 The charge density (N) was calculated to be 8.51 × 1018 cm−3 for HMA CuO, which is less than that of CAL CuO (1.537019 cm−3). The higher N value in CAL CuO appears to arise mainly from Cu+ in the electrode as revealed by XANES in Fig. 3. The Cu+ sites become centres for charge recombination by trapping photogenerated holes, and thus inhibit charge transfer in CuO instead of promoting it.31,32 On the other hand, Cu+ defects are removed by further oxidation during the HMA treatment to produce an impurity free-CuO phase.
To investigate the stability of the photocathodes under light illumination, photocurrent was measured under chopped illumination at 0.2 VRHE for 1200 s as shown in Fig. 6a. The HMA CuO electrode shows much higher initial photocurrent in line with the J–V curves in Fig. 5a, as well as much better stability than those of CAL CuO. To confirm that H2 and O2 are indeed generated from the HMA CuO photocathode and Pt counter electrode during the measurements, the evolving gases were analysed by gas chromatography as shown in Fig. 6b. The HMA CuO photocathode was biased at 0.1 VRHE under AM 1.5 light illumination for 60 min. The ratio of produced H2 and O2 is close to the stoichiometry and the faradaic efficiencies of oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions are ca. 88% and 82%, respectively. Thus it indicates that the majority of photocurrent observed in the PEC measurements resulted from photoelectrochemical water splitting reaction. The rest of the faradaic efficiencies could be accounted from back reaction of water splitting on the working and counter electrode surface and imperfect gas collection due to strong adsorption of evolved gas on the electrode and gas dissolution in the electrolyte.33,34 The reduced faradaic efficiency of hydrogen was also considered as slight electron consumption by self-reduction of the CuO surface. In spite of these limitations, gas evolution results clearly show that the HMA treated CuO can work effectively for photoelectrochemical overall water splitting. We believe that the stability and faradaic efficiency of CuO can be further enhanced by depositing a protective layer.21,22,35

The dotted lines indicate expected amounts of evolved oxygen and hydrogen and circles are measured amounts of evolved gases. 
4. Conclusions
The HMA process with silicon wafer as a susceptor was introduced for the first time to fabricate a tree branch-shaped CuO cathode for PEC water reduction within a short reaction time of 10 min. The obtained HMA CuO exhibited at least three attributes highly desirable for efficient photoelectrodes distinguished from CAL CuO fabricated by conventional thermal heating: (i) the unique hierarchical structure that allows facile charge transport. (ii) high crystallinity and purity with less defects that reduces photogenerated charge carrier trap sites and thus carrier recombination. (iii) Large surface areas and pore volumes for easy access of electrolytes. As a result, the HMA CuO electrode recorded an excellent photocurrent −4.4 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE, which is the highest value reported to date for copper oxide photocathodes without co-catalysts in PEC water splitting. Work is under progress to improve the PEC activity and stability by an appropriate surface modification.
