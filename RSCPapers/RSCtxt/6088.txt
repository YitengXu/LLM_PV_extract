    , Accepted 27th January 2016First published on 28th January 2016AbstractThe room temperature growth of highly <111> oriented sputtered NiO thin films on glass and silicon substrates previously covered with a <111> oriented Cu2O film is reported. The results are compared to those obtained from single layer NiO thin films using the same deposition conditions. Electron microdiffraction analyses indicate that NiO columns are heteroepitaxially grown on the columns of a Cu2O seed layer. The well-matched atomic configurations between the Cu atoms in the {111} planes of Cu2O and the O atoms in the {111} planes of NiO may provide a strong driving force to promote this local heteroepitaxial growth. Such heteroepitaxial growth behavior in the columns can significantly improve crystallization. Moreover, valence electron energy loss spectroscopy has been employed to investigate the interband transition properties of the NiO films, which shows that the interband transition intensity can be tuned by this local heteroepitaxial growth.
1. Introduction
Controlling the crystallization and preferred orientation of reactively sputtered thin films is always of great interest, as their microstructural features can strongly influence their functional properties. Using reactive magnetron sputtering processes, several parameters, such as reactive gas partial pressure, total sputtering pressure, substrate temperature or bias voltage can be used to tune film growth orientation.1–5 Another way to control the preferred orientation of a film is to employ specific substrates exhibiting lattice constants close to those of the film. Within these kinds of substrates, the films grow epitaxially and their texture is dependent on that of the substrate. However, the high cost of such substrates may restrict their use to control film orientation at a large scale. Recently, we have demonstrated that local epitaxial growth (LEG) in Cu2O films occurs from a seed layer and control of the growth orientation is independent of deposition conditions and air contamination at the interface between the seed layer and the top layer.6 Since sputtered thin films usually exhibit a columnar microstructure, this LEG behavior implies that one column in the top layer is epitaxially grown on one column of the seed layer.
NiO thin films have attracted intensive attention for various applications in electrochromic7 and nonvolatile resistive random access memory devices,8 catalysts,9 and organic photovoltaics.10 NiO crystallizes in the cubic rocksalt structure (space group Fmm), where the Ni2+ and O2− ions are six-fold coordinated. Along the <111> direction, NiO consists of alternating Ni2+ and O2− planes with Ni2+ or O2− as terminations, giving rise to a net surface charge and an electric dipole moment (infinite surface energy) in the repeating unit perpendicular to {111} surfaces. This leads to polar NiO {111} surfaces.11–13 Accompanied by surface reconstruction (hydroxylation or adsorption of contamination beyond simple bulk truncation to stabilize polarity11–14), these polar surfaces exhibit some unique properties. For instance, <111> oriented NiO has a larger work function than <100> oriented one, which enables to dramatically enhance the open circuit voltage and power conversion efficiency of polymer bulk-heterojunction solar cells by inserting a <111> oriented NiO thin film as an anode interfacial layer.10,15
Although <111> oriented NiO thin films exhibit interesting properties, their synthesis by vapor phase processes usually requires the use of specific single crystal substrates, e.g., Rh(111),16 Al2O3(0001)17 and Si(100) buffered with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ).18 However, the limitations of a small sample size and high cost within methods used to produce these configurations (such as pulsed laser deposition and molecular beam epitaxy) prevent their wide applications. Reactive magnetron sputtering, as a standard manufacturing process associated with the relatively low-cost and easy fabrication of large-area devices, is a good choice for industrial production. Different reactive magnetron sputtering methods (including direct-current (DC), radio frequency (RF) and high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS)) have been used to grow NiO thin films from a metallic Ni target, but most of them show <100> preferred orientation or non-preferred orientation.19–21 Thus, the growth of highly <111> oriented NiO thin films by reactive sputtering on non-matched substrates at room temperature is still challenging. The Cu2O structure consists of a face-centered cubic array of Cu+ ions interpenetrated by a body-centered cubic array of O2− ions. The lattice constant of Cu2O is 0.427 nm while that of rocksalt-like NiO is 0.417 nm. The lattice mismatch between NiO and Cu2O is about 2.4%. On the other hand, Cu2O {111} planes with Cu termination seem to be naturally matched with polar NiO {111} planes, including the number of atoms and atomic positions. From these crystallographic characteristics, the epitaxial criteria between Cu2O {111} and NiO {111} may be fulfilled.
Intraband transition related with band tail and energy level or exciton defects in semiconductors has been widely studied by optical absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy.22,23 However, interband transition, which contains information on critical points, relative energy positions and density of states, has received less attention. Few tools are available to investigate interband transition, e.g., optical reflectance,24 ellipsometry,25 and valence electron energy loss spectroscopy (VEELS).26 VEELS coupled with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) exhibits the great advantages of high spatial resolution and different mechanisms to detect excitons with respect to optical methods. It has rapidly developed as a useful technique to study dielectric functions and interband transition.26–31
In this work, we report the local heteroepitaxial growth of polycrystalline NiO thin films deposited on top of a highly <111> oriented Cu2O layer at room temperature using a reactive magnetron sputtering process. The influence of local heteroepitaxial growth on the microstructure and interband transition of the thin films has been studied.
2. Experimental
Cu2O thin films with a <111> or <100> preferred orientation were deposited by reactive pulsed-DC magnetron sputtering. The details concerning the growth and characterization of the Cu2O thin films can be found in ref. 1. For NiO thin film deposition, no intentional heating was applied to the substrate holder and the self-established deposition temperature was close to room temperature. The argon flow rate was fixed at 25 sccm, while the oxygen flow rate was varied in the 4–11 sccm range. A pulsed-DC supply (Pinnacle + Advanced Energy) was connected to the metallic nickel target (2 inches in diameter and 1 mm thick with a purity of 99.995%). The current applied to the target, the frequency and the off-time were fixed at 0.3 A, 50 kHz and 4 μs, respectively. The distance between the substrate and the target was fixed at 75 mm. To prepare the bilayer samples, a Cu2O layer with a <111> orientation acting as a seed layer was first deposited on non-matched glass and silicon substrates. Once the required thickness of the seed layer was reached, the current applied to the copper target was switched off and a NiO layer was grown on top of it using different deposition conditions. Since these two oxides were grown in the same deposition chamber, the NiO layer was deposited without air contamination of the Cu2O/NiO interface. X-Ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance with Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) in the Bragg Brentano configuration) was used to investigate the phase structure and growth orientation of the films deposited on the glass substrate. In previous studies, we have shown that the phase structure, preferred orientation and microstructure of Cu2O thin films are independent of the nature of the non-matched substrate (glass or silicon).1,6 The microstructure was studied by a TEM (JEOL ARM 200-Cold FEG fitted with a GIF Quantum ER) equipped with an electron energy loss spectrometer (EELS). The VEELS spectra of the NiO thin films in the low energy loss have been recorded using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV−1, an emission current of 5 μA and an energy dispersion of 0.05 eV ch−1. All the spectra were acquired in a diffraction mode, with an energy resolution of 0.45–0.5 eV defined by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the zero loss peak (ZLP). The convergence semi-angle α and the collection semi-angle β were 7 and 18 mrad, respectively. For the purpose of TEM and VEELS analyses, cross-section TEM samples of the films deposited on the silicon substrates were prepared using a focused ion beam (FIB)-scanning electron microscope (SEM) dual beam system (FEI Helios 600) using an ‘in situ’ lift-out technique. Final thinning was done with low voltage milling (5 kV−1) to reduce any possible preparation artifacts.
3. Results and discussion
The X-ray diffractograms of the single layer NiO thin films deposited on the glass substrates with different O2 flow rates are shown in Fig. 1(a). Within this range of oxygen flow rates, no metallic nickel is evidenced by XRD, indicating that all the NiO thin films are single-phase. The increase in the oxygen flow rate from 4 to 7 sccm does not influence the preferred orientation. However, the use of a higher oxygen flow rate (11 sccm) induces a decrease in film crystallinity, which may result from reduction of the kinetic energy of the sputtered atoms and/or enhancement of oxygen ion bombardment. Overall, the signal to background noise ratio is weak in these diffractograms. Fig. 1(a) shows that the crystallinity of the single layer NiO thin films is very poor and there is no strong preferred orientation.
 Fig. 1  (a) X-ray diffractograms of the single layer NiO thin films (about 200 nm thick) deposited at various oxygen flow rates. (b) X-ray diffractograms of the Cu2O/NiO bilayers. The NiO films have been deposited using the same oxygen flow rates as those used in Fig. 1(a). The X-ray diffractogram of single layer Cu2O is displayed at the bottom as a reference. The inset shows the schematic growth architecture (200 nm NiO grown on a 360 nm Cu2O film previously deposited on a glass substrate). 
The X-ray diffractogram of a Cu2O thin film (about 360 nm) deposited at a total pressure of 1 Pa and oxygen flow rate of 11 sccm is presented at the bottom part of Fig. 1(b). An intense (111) diffraction peak is clearly observed, indicating the highly <111> preferred orientation of this material. As mentioned in ref. 6, pole figure measurement clearly evidenced the fiber texture of this Cu2O film. NiO films of about 200 nm in thickness have been deposited on the Cu2O films without air contamination of the Cu2O/NiO interface. The X-ray diffractograms of these bilayers are presented in Fig. 1(b). Although the same oxygen flow rate values for NiO deposition were used as those in Fig. 1(a), the preferred orientation and crystallization of the NiO films are strongly improved by the use of the Cu2O layers. Whatever the oxygen flow rate of NiO is, the (200) and (220) diffraction peaks of NiO are not clearly observed anymore. On the other hand, the 2θ diffraction peak at approx. 36–37° shows two contributions. The first one located at approx. 36.6° is related to the Cu2O layer and the second one with a higher diffraction angle corresponds to the diffraction of the NiO (111) planes. Moreover, the intensity of the NiO (111) diffraction peaks in the bilayers is very high compared to that of single layer NiO thin films with the same thickness, demonstrating better crystallinity. Such results indicate that the preferred orientation of Cu2O strongly governs that of the NiO layer, regardless of the NiO deposition conditions. This means that the Cu2O layer acts as a seed layer, which can be used to tune the growth orientation of the top NiO layer. Finally, the NiO (111) diffraction peak intensity in the bilayers with the same thickness has a tendency to decrease with increasing oxygen flow rate, which is a trend similar to that observed in the single NiO layer.
TEM analyses have been performed to study the microstructure of the bilayers. The TEM images of NiO deposited with 11 sccm O2 grown on Cu2O are presented in Fig. 2. Fig. 2(a) shows the low magnification TEM bright field image, which demonstrates columnar growth in both the NiO and Cu2O layers. Electron microdiffraction has been employed to identify the growth orientation. The electron microdiffraction patterns for NiO and Cu2O acquired from the regions almost aligned along the film thickness are presented in Fig. 2(b) and (c), respectively. Such similar patterns clearly show heteroepitaxial growth in the columns between these two layers. As seen in Fig. 2(b) and (c), the (111) planes in these two layers are parallel to the substrate surface, which is consistent with the results from the X-ray diffractograms.

(c) Electron microdiffraction pattern of Cu2O in the region labelled by a star in the bottom layer. The zone axis is [01]. 
To describe this local heteroepitaxial growth unambiguously, the interface region between Cu2O and NiO has been investigated by high resolution TEM (HRTEM), as shown in Fig. 3(a). One Cu2O column (marked as X) has a width of about 15 nm while the width of three small NiO columns (marked as 1, 2 and 3) is approx. 8 nm, 3 nm and 4 nm. These three columns have nucleated and grown on a large Cu2O column. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) analyses along the column growth direction have been performed. Fig. 3(b)–(e) show the FFT patterns of the square regions labeled as 1, 1.1, 1.2, and X, respectively. The FFT pattern of Cu2O (see Fig. 3(e)) demonstrates the <111> growth orientation of the seed layer. At the interface region labeled as 1.2, the <111> growth orientation of NiO is clearly identified by the FFT pattern shown in Fig. 3(d), which indicates that the <111> orientation of NiO is already set at the initial growth. Moving to the regions labeled as 1.1 and 1, the FFT patterns (see Fig. 3(c) and (b)) distinctly show the <111> growth orientation of NiO. The growth orientations of two nearby small NiO columns (2 and 3) have also been checked. As shown in Fig. 3(f) and (g), these two small columns also exhibit a <111> texture. Such results clearly show that several NiO columns can grow on one Cu2O column in this NiO/Cu2O local heteroepitaxy. Such behavior is quite different from that reported in the local epitaxial growth of Cu2O films: one column of the top layer is grown on one column of the seed layer. Therefore, the schematic microstructure of this new local epitaxial growth is depicted in Fig. 3(h). We can notice that the FFT patterns show some additional diffraction spots situated around the primary spots, which come from the characteristics of fiber texture and small column width. The thickness of the TEM foil is estimated to be approx. 50–70 nm using VEELS, i.e. much larger than the column width. This implies that the TEM foil contains several columns along the electron beam direction. Besides, the fiber texture in the Cu2O seed layer6 may produce a similar fiber texture to that in NiO. Hence, several columns with some rotational degrees of freedom around the fiber axis result in multiple diffraction spots.

The interface profile highlighted by a solid line was identified using energy-dispersive spectroscopy.

(f) and (g) are the FFT patterns of square regions 2 and 3 perpendicular to the column growth direction, respectively. (h) Schematic drawing of the growth architecture between the Cu2O seed layer (in blue) and the NiO top layer (in red). 
The effect of the NiO thickness on its texture has also been studied (see Fig. 4). For single layer NiO thin films deposited with an O2 flow rate of 11 sccm, the thickness strongly affects the preferred orientation. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the 200 nm thick NiO film is poorly crystallized, while a <110> preferred orientation is evidenced when the thickness is fixed to 800 nm. This can be explained by considering a competitive growth mechanism between the (111), (200) and (220) planes during NiO growth. Another possible source is the stress in the single layer NiO. Using Stoney's method, the compressive stress of a 200 nm thick NiO film is 2.2 ± 0.3 GPa. A higher NiO thickness may accommodate part of the stress, consequently changing the preferred orientation of NiO. The effect of the NiO thickness on its preferred orientation disappears when the NiO film is deposited on a Cu2O seed layer (Fig. 4(b)). Whatever the NiO thickness is, only a <111> texture is evidenced for NiO deposited on <111> oriented Cu2O. The shape of the diffraction peak in the 36–37° region is dependent on the NiO thickness. For the 200 nm thick film, two diffraction peaks are observed as previously mentioned. The low angle peak is related to the (111) planes of the Cu2O layer, while the high angle diffraction peak corresponds to the (111) planes of NiO. On the other hand, only one wide diffraction peak is observed for the 800 nm thick NiO film deposited on Cu2O. Its position is ranging between those of (111) Cu2O and (111) NiO. Such result can be explained by considering a progressive change in the NiO contribution due to a decrease in compressive stress.

(b) X-ray diffractograms of NiO with different thicknesses deposited on the Cu2O seed layer with a constant thickness. The inset shows the magnified (111) diffraction peak. 
The influence of the Cu2O seed layer thickness on the preferred orientation of NiO has also been investigated. 200 nm thick NiO films have been deposited using 11 sccm O2 on Cu2O seed layers with different thicknesses (60, 120 and 360 nm). X-ray diffractograms show that a 60 nm seed layer has some ability to promote the growth of NiO (111) planes parallel to the substrate surface, but other diffraction peaks (such as (200) and (220)) are also clearly evidenced and crystallization of the thin film is poor (see Fig. S1, ESI†). This means that thick Cu2O films are necessary to attain the highly <111> preferred orientation of NiO. Similar to the local epitaxial growth of Cu2O,6 we have checked that air contamination of the Cu2O/NiO interface does not block the growth of <111> oriented NiO (see Fig. S2, ESI†).
Since the preferred orientations of Cu2O (<100> or <111>) can be tuned by changing the total sputtering pressure,1,6 NiO films have also been deposited on the <100> oriented Cu2O thin film. Special growth conditions (total pressure of 0.5 Pa and O2 flow rate of 14 sccm) have been used to grow the single layer <100> oriented Cu2O thin films (400 nm). Then, a 200 nm thick NiO film was grown using an O2 flow rate of 14 sccm on top of the seed layer. As shown in Fig. 5, a (220) diffraction peak of NiO with a high intensity is clearly evidenced at approx. 62.6° as observed for the NiO single layer in Fig. 1(a), which indicates that this <100> oriented Cu2O layer cannot support the local heteroepitaxial growth of <100> oriented NiO. It is out beyond our expectation that the NiO thin film should fully follow the <100> orientation of Cu2O. Comparing such a result with the <111> texture of the NiO thin film on the <111> oriented Cu2O, it is believed that the atomic structures at the interface may play an important role to drive the local heteroepitaxial growth. The surface terminations of Cu2O {111} can be Cu or O atoms, but they are not equivalent either in terms of the number of atoms or in terms of their positions (see Fig. 6(a)). On the other hand, the terminations of NiO {111} are Ni or O atoms, and their numbers and positions are identifiable (see Fig. 6(b)). The configurations of the Cu atoms in the {111} planes of Cu2O are well matched with the Ni or O atoms in the {111} planes of NiO. Therefore, this local heteroepitaxial growth could be qualitatively understood like this: Cu terminations in the <111> oriented Cu2O seed layer may prefer to form bonds with O atoms when depositing the first monolayer of NiO, which provides the driving force to configure the subsequent Ni atoms with the same structure, giving rise to the polar <111> orientation with alternating Ni and O layers along the growth direction. In the case of the {100} planes of Cu2O, the surface terminations are Cu or O atoms with non-equivalent numbers and positions (see Fig. 6(a)), whereas NiO {100} planes always contain Ni and O atoms (see Fig. 6(b)). This unmatched characteristic between the Cu2O and NiO {100} planes may introduce more defects and prevent local heteroepitaxial growth.

VEELS spectra contain fruitful information on dielectric properties and interband transition,26–29 which could be influenced by the microstructure of materials.27,29,32 The VEELS spectra of the single layer nanocrystalline NiO and the local heteroepitaxial NiO under the same growth conditions have been investigated. The plasmon energy (Ep) can be estimated by the Drude model from a free electron gas using the following expression: (1)in which ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, e is the elementary charge, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, m0 is the electron mass and n is the number of free electrons per unit volume.26 Taking into account the O 2p and Ni 4s valence electrons, eqn (1) gives a theoretical bulk plasmon energy of 21.3 eV in NiO. However, the single scattering distribution (SSD) VEELS spectra from both the single layer nanocrystalline NiO and the local heteroepitaxial NiO thin films show an experimental plasmon energy of about 23 eV, as shown in Fig. 7, which is larger than the theoretical one. This kind of plasmon shift is usual and mainly comes from band gaps and interband transitions.26,33 At the energy loss of about 20.3 eV, a shoulder peak is also visible (see Fig. 7). This characteristic is consistent with the multipeaks near the plasmon energy in the theoretical VEELS spectrum of NiO calculated by many-body perturbation theory.30 Beside the plasmon excitation, two broad peaks at about 4–10 eV and 12–18 eV (marked as A and B, respectively), are clearly evidenced in Fig. 7. Since the VEELS spectra in Fig. 7 have been normalized by the maximum intensity at the plasmon peak, checking the relative intensity gives information that the local heteroepitaxial NiO has a higher relative intensity at peak A than the single NiO layer. On the other hand, the relative intensity at peak B in the local heteroepitaxial NiO is lower. It is worth noting that the band gap onset value of about 3.45 eV is almost the same in these two kinds of NiO thin films, as shown in Fig. 7.

To understand the characteristics of the VEELS spectra, further analyses on dielectric function have been performed. An approach to describe the interaction of a transmitted electron beam with a solid sample is in terms of the dielectric function ε(E) = ε1(E) + iε2(E), which is similar to a response function that describes the absorption and refraction of light in a solid. In a dielectric formulation, the SSD(E) can be written in the form: (2)where I0 is the zero-loss intensity, a0 is the Bohr radius, t is the specimen thickness, ν is the speed of the incident electron beam, β is the collection semi-angle, and θE = E/(γ μ0ν2) is the characteristic scattering angle (where γ = 1 – ν2/χ2, c is the speed of light).26,28,33 Thus, the SSD is proportional to Im[−1/ε(E)], where (3)is known as the energy loss function. Once this function has been attained, the real part of the inverse complex dielectric function Re[1/ε(E)] can be calculated by the Kramers–Kronig analysis, then the dielectric function ε(E) = ε1(E) + iε2(E) can be determined. The imaginary part ε2(E) and the absorption coefficient α(E) contain information on the interband transition energy and intensity, which will provide insight into the electronic structure of materials.
The EELSMODEL software was employed to simulate the dielectric function of the NiO films from the SSD spectra.34ε1(E) and ε2(E) of the single layer and local heteroepitaxial NiO thin films are shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), respectively, where the corresponding spectra of the NiO single crystal from Powell et al. measured by optical reflectivity are also depicted as a reference.24 As shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), the shapes of ε1(E) and ε2(E) attained from the VEELS spectra are quite similar to the optical measurement, implying the reliable simulation used here. It should be noted that the absolute values of ε1(E) and ε2(E) show some discrepancy between VEELS and the optical reflectivity methods, which may come from a variety of sources. One possible origin is the lack of an accurate SSD(E) for lower energies (i.e., lower than the band gap) mainly due to the ZLP subtraction and the limited energy resolution, whereas the optical method still exhibits good resolution in this energy region. The different mechanisms to detect the excitons in these two methods could be another source. Excitons due to intra-atomic d–d excitations that are usually encountered in transition metal oxides, cannot be probed by optical spectroscopy due to their forbidden character in the dipole selection rule.30,31 However, these excitons could be observed by VEELS, where other selection rules hold.30

(c) The absorption coefficient calculated from the dielectric function. The optical reference data measured by reflectivity is attained from ref. 24 by Powell et al. 
Since the imaginary part ε2(E) can provide useful information on the interband transitions, the details of ε2(E) in the single layer and local heteroepitaxial layer NiO thin films have been checked. Three peaks at about 4.2 eV, 13.1 eV and 17.4 eV have been clearly evidenced in the single layer and local heteroepitaxial NiO thin films, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The physical origin of the peak at about 4.2 eV is still under debate. Several kinds of interband transitions have been proposed, such as transition from the Ni occupied t2g and the unoccupied eg minority-spin d states,30 from the occupied O 2p to the empty Ni eg,35 and Ni eg–eg excitation.36 Concerning our NiO films, a change from a nanocrystalline single layer to a local heteroepitaxial film with high crystallization increases the intensity of the peak at 4.2 eV. However, moving onto the peak at about 13.1 eV, the intensity is lower for the heteroepitaxial layer. Finally, the intensity of the 17.4 eV peak is almost not influenced by the type of NiO films. It should be mentioned that the origins of the two peaks at about 13.1 eV and 17.4 eV remain unknown, as the theoretical calculations by different methods fail to predict them.30,35,36 Nevertheless, the predominant featured peak at about 4.2 eV in the imaginary part is strikingly modified. Since the intensity of the absorption coefficient is directly related with the density of states involved in interband transition, the absorption coefficient α(E) has been calculated from ε1(E) and ε2(E) using the following equation: (4)
where λ(E) is the wavelength. Fig. 8(c) shows the calculated α(E) of a single nanocrystalline NiO layer and a local heteroepitaxial one, as well as a spectrum from the optical measurement as a reference. It is clearly revealed that the absorption coefficient at about 4.2 eV is enhanced and the absorption at about 13.1 eV largely decreased for the local heteroepitaxial NiO thin film. Such results indicate that the density of states involved in the interband transition at about 4.2 eV are raised, while the states are reduced at the transition energy of 13.1 eV, when tuning the NiO thin films from a nanocrystalline structure to a local heteroepitaxial layer with better orientation and crystallization. Right now, we can understand the intensity evolution of SSD(E) in peaks A and B (see Fig. 7), which mainly comes from the change in the interband transition density. Therefore, it is shown that the details of interband transition can be tuned by the microstructure of the NiO thin films.
4. Conclusion
NiO thin films with a strong <111> orientation were deposited by reactive sputtering at room temperature using a two-step deposition procedure. Cu2O thin films with a <111> texture were first deposited on glass and silicon substrates, acting as seed layers for NiO thin films grown atop. The NiO thin films in these bilayer samples always show the highly <111> preferred orientation, independent of the growth conditions. Transmission electron microscopy analyses show that the columns of the NiO layer are heteroepitaxially grown on the columns of the Cu2O seed layer. Such kind of local heteroepitaxial growth behavior likely originates from the matched atomic configurations between the Cu atoms in the {111} planes of Cu2O and the O atoms in the {111} planes of NiO. The interband transitions and the dielectric functions have also been studied by valence electron energy loss spectrometry, which shows that the details of interband transition can be modified by tuning the NiO thin films from a nanocrystalline single layer to a local heteroepitaxial layer.
