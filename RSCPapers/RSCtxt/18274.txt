, Accepted 11th September 2014First published on 12th September 2014AbstractPhotovoltaic performances are critically dependent on efficient photoexcited charge carrier generation. Vanadium ions are introduced into titanium dioxide (TiO2) as a photocatalyst to tailor the energy level alignment of TiO2 and the conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). Incorporation of vanadium ions into TiO2 yields a remarkable decrease of the energy offset between the conduction band edge of TiO2 and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of P3HT. The reduction of the ‘excess’ energy offset leads to a faster electron transfer at the interface of the bulk heterojunction with the lifetime decreasing from 30.2 to 19.7 ps, thus giving rise to a notable enhancement of the photovoltaic performance. That is, a power conversion efficiency of 3.01% for the vanadium-doped TiO2/P3HT solar cell at 5.0 wt% vanadium-doping is obtained as compared to 2.00% for pure TiO2.
1. Introduction
Organic/inorganic hybrid solar cells (HSCs) have attracted increasing attention to meet the clean-energy demands of the twenty-first century, due to their potential applications for the production of flexible and large-area solar cells at dramatically low fabrication cost.1–3 Such inorganic/organic HSCs can take advantage of the beneficial properties of both types of materials such as solution-processed organic semiconductors at low temperatures and high electron mobility of inorganic semiconductors.4–6 Despite the advantages of organic/inorganic HSCs, the power conversion efficiencies of the HSCs are still below the commercial viability thus far. A number of effective strategies have been adopted to improve the device performances including the tuning of the size, photoconductivity, morphology and the n- or p-type character of inorganic nanocrystal, the introduction of buffer layers and the optimization of device architecture.7–11 Among these, the use of foreign ions embedded into inorganic semiconductor is quite promising, because this offers several merits, such as, the incorporation of foreign ions into inorganic semiconductors can be prepared by a solution-processing and their n- or p-type characteristics dependent on the type of ions, plus the electronic and optical properties of the inorganic semiconductors can be tuned by foreign ions.12–14
Recently, vanadium-based semiconductors have attracted much attention owing to their excellent electronic characteristics originating from the multiple oxidation states of vanadium.15–17 The incorporation of vanadium dopant into titanium dioxide (TiO2) have exhibited intriguing electronic properties such as enhancing surface energy, broadening the absorption band and suppressing the geminate recombination of photoexcited electron–hole pairs, which can improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 effectively.18–20 Therefore, V-modified TiO2 photocatalyst is a promising candidate for HSC applications. However, over the last five years, most of the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic/inorganic hybrid solar cells based on P3HT (without considering P3HT based organic polymer solar cells) is still low, around 2% only.7,21–26 What's more, the mechanism of the enhancement in device performances stemming from vanadium ions has not been clearly unveiled. Although incorporating vanadium ions into bulk semiconductors has been largely employed for many decades, nonetheless electronically active doping induced energy level control of the hybrid bulk heterojunctions has been rarely touched and the demonstration of robust functional optoelectronic devices had thus far been elusive. Especially, the energy level control effect and its influence on photo excited charge transfer rate has rarely been explored.
The transfer rate of photoexcited charge carrier at the interface of organic/inorganic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) is one of the key factors influencing the device performances.27,28 Efficient charge extraction requires faster transport of photogenerated carrier with a minimal loss of free energy.29 How to accelerate the charge transfer, and to ensure that charge transfer can overwhelm the geminate recombinations of the electron–hole pairs within the BHJ remains a challenging task. It has been well established that the photoexcited carrier transfer rates are closely related to the energy level alignment between the acceptor and donor.30,31 Herein, we incorporate vanadium ions to decorate TiO2 nanocrystals, and expect that the energy level of the acceptor can be tailored. With better matched energy level of acceptor/donor system, the photoexcited charge transfer should be enhanced. In this report, the influences of vanadium dopant on HSC performances were studied. Especially, the crucial role of the dopant playing in regulating energy band positions was clarified and the transfer dynamics of the photoexcited electrons were revealed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Ethanol (≥99.5%, Aldrich), polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular weight of 20000), nitric acid (68.0–70.0%, Aldrich), acetic acid (99.8%, Aldrich), tetrabutyl titanate (97%, Aldrich), P25 (≥99.5%, Degussa, Germany), OP emulsifying agent (Triton X-100, Aldrich), sodium metavanadate (99%, Aldrich), isopropanol (≥99.7%, Aldrich), conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) P3HT and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), etc., were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Ltd., Hongkong, China. All reagents were used as received without further purification. The deionized water was produced from Millipore Milli-Q water purification system. Fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (FTO, sheet resistance 8 Ω cm−2) was purchased from Hartford Glass Co., USA.
2.2. Synthesis of vanadium-doped TiO2 colloid
Vanadium-doped TiO2 colloid was prepared by the procedures in a similar way as done in the previous work.32 Briefly, 10 mL of tetrabutyl titanate and certain mount of sodium metavanadate (NaVO3) water solution were added to 100 mL of distilled water under stirring, followed by a precipitate immediately. And then the mixed solution containing nitric acid (1 mL) and acetic acid (10 mL) was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave. Under vigorous stirring a precursor was formed, followed by an ultrasonic stirring for 30 min. Finally, the mixture was hydrothermally treated at 200 °C for 24 h to form a colloid of vanadium-doped TiO2. Subsequently, the P25 (0.075 g) was dispersed into the colloid by ultrasonically vibrating for 90 min and hydrothermally treating at 200 °C for 12 h to form a uniform colloid. At last, the resultant slurry was concentrated to 1/5 of its original volume by a thermal evaporation, and PEG-20000 (0.5 g) and a few drops of the OP emulsification reagent were added and an even and stable vanadium-doped TiO2 colloid was produced.
2.3. Fabrication of HSC
The FTO glass substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with acetone, ethanol alcohol, and deionized-water, successively for 5 min. And then the substrates were dried by thermal treatment at 100 °C. A layer of acceptor film with a thickness of 250 nm was prepared by spin-coating the vanadium-doped TiO2 colloid on substrate, followed by sintering in air at 450 °C for 30 min. Then the acceptor film was soaked in a 0.15 M conjugated polymer P3HT methylbenzene solution for 12 h to uptake P3HT. Next, the PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated onto the bulk-heterojunction and annealed at 80 °C for 10 min. Finally, platinum (Pt) was deposited on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer as cathode layer by vacuum evaporation technique.
2.4. Material and device characterization
The phases of vanadium-doped TiO2 powder were identified by a Rigaku MiniFlex II X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) and collected in a scan mode at a scanning speed of 5° min−1 in the 2θ range between 10 and 80°. The morphologies of the vanadium-doped TiO2 film and the cross-section of BHJ were characterized by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800, Japan). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum was recorded by using an FE-SEM equipped with an EDS detector (OXFORD 7021). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) characteristics and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results were performed using a BAS 100B instrument at room temperature and a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6, 0.1 M) in acetonitrile as the supporting electrolyte, a platinized platinum (0.5 cm2) as the counter electrodes, Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. Mott–Schottky measurements were done at the frequency of 1 kHz in the aqueous solution of 0.05 M Na2SO4 using a BAS 100B instrument and Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of devices were taken under the illumination of standard solar irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (AM1.5) with Xenon lamp as a light source and were recorded on an Electrochemical Workstation (Xe Lamp Oriel Sol3A™ Class AAA Solar Simulators 94023A USA). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE, also termed as external quantum efficiency) measurements were performed at short-circuit condition. A class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan) served as a light source. The light was directed through a monochromator (model 74100, Oriel Instrument, California, USA) onto the HSCs.
2.5. Photoexcited charge transfer measurements
Photoexcited charge transfer measurements of the BHJs were performed on the mode-locked Ti–sapphire laser (Coherent Mira 900) in combination with a regenerative amplifier (Coherent Legend-F) system. Time-resolved photoluminescence experiments were measured on a spectrometer (Bruker Optics 250IS/SM) with intensified charge coupled device detector (CCD, Andor, IStar740). The BHJs were excited by 120 fs laser pulses at 400 nm with a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The time resolution of this experiment was determined to be ∼60 ps. Femtosecond transient absorption spectrum was performed as follows: the ultrafast light source with a temporal resolution of ∼120 fs was generated by a mode-locked titanium–sapphire laser operating at 800 nm. An optical parametric amplifier (OPA-800CF-1, Spectra Physics) provided the ultra-short laser pulses at desired wavelengths (∼120 fs, full width at half maximum). A continuum white light generated from a sapphire plate was directed into the excited sample and detected by the CCD. Ultra-short laser pulses at 400 nm were employed as the pump light for the sample excitation and the probe light for the absorption measurement. Transient absorption at various delay times was measured by controlling the arrival time of each laser pulse at the sample. The laser system was operated at a repetition rate of 10 Hz, thus each pulse excited fully relaxed sample. Each data was obtained by averaging 100 individual measurements to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and the typical detection sensitivity of the difference absorption (ΔOD) was better than 10−4.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Photoexcited electron transfer in BHJ
The photoexcited electron transfer can be roughly evaluated by the photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield measurements of P3HT layer, which is coupled with an appropriate electron- or hole-extraction layer.33–35 Comparative studies on the bare TiO2/P3HT against V-doped TiO2/P3HT blend films enable the identification of the role of vanadium dopant in the electron transfer process. Under the almost identical experimental conditions, the time-integrated PL intensity is greatly reduced when P3HT is interfaced with an electron extraction layer, as shown in Fig. 1a. The PL intensity is further quenched by a factor of about 1.2 in the bilayer with V-doped TiO2 as compared to the bare TiO2. An efficient PL quenching is indicative of a high degree of photoexcited electron transfer in V-doped TiO2/P3HT BHJ. Furthermore, it is known that the PL lifetime allows one to estimate the photoinduced charge transfer rate of the BHJs, therefore the time-resolved single-photon counting PL measurements were performed and the results were shown in Fig. 1b. The three different films all exhibit an instantaneous response near zero delay, which are well interpreted as the auto-correlation of laser pulse. However, the emission decay from 60 to 500 ps is intensively quenched when either TiO2 or V-doped TiO2 is present as an acceptor. This important emission quenching originates from a rapid charge transfer process at the interface of BHJ.36 Considering that the emission kinetics exhibit an exponential decay, the different lifetimes can be obtained by fitting the curves using the theoretical models by eqn (2). For neat P3HT film, a single lifetime of 890 ps is obtained by fitting the transients. But for TiO2 and V-doped TiO2 as an electron extraction layer, the short-lived components dominate the transients and the lifetimes were obtained to be 78 and 64 ps, respectively. The obtained lifetimes reasonably agree with the reported results elsewhere.37–39 Then, we can conclude that the reduction of PL lifetime is attributed to the expected rapid carrier transport in BHJs. After the incorporation of vanadium ions into TiO2, the photoexcited carrier transfer becomes faster. However, as the time resolution of these measurements (∼60 ps) is not high enough to quantify the fast electron transfer. Therefore, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) with a temporal resolution of ∼120 fs and a high SNR (10−4) was applied next to obtain the more details on the photoexcited electron dynamics.

TAS spectra have been widely used to study the charge generation dynamics of different solar cells at the interface between electron- and hole-transporters.32,33,40–42 As shown in Fig. 2, the TAS spectra bear one pronounced photobleaching (PB) bands and one pronounced photoabsorption band (PA). Due to the strong photobleaching effect, the TA transients monitor the hole population in the ground state in P3HT when probed at 602 nm. While probed at 650 nm, it is reasonable to attribute the positive PA band to the state-filling effects.40,43,44 In this report, the variation of electron population should dominate the contribution to PA transients. To confirm this, the TAS measurements of neat P3HT film were performed for comparison. As observed from Fig. 2, for both neat P3HT and V–TiO2/P3HT, the difference absorption (ΔOD) of the PA band reduces by the almost same degree from 0 to 1 ps, i.e., 58% and 52% for neat P3HT, V–TiO2/P3HT, respectively. This indicates that the fast decay that originates from the vibronic relaxations was affected very little as expected. However, from 1 to 30 ps, the PA band decreases 45% and 79% for neat P3HT and V–TiO2/P3HT, respectively. This remarkable difference reveals that there exists hot electron transfer from P3HT to V–TiO2 within 1–30 ps, thus resulting in the quenching of PA signal. This demonstrates that after the incorporation of vanadium species, the electron transfers at the interface of donor and acceptor indeed have been enhanced.

Fig. 3a shows femtosecond TAS decays of TiO2/P3HT and V-doped TiO2/P3HT films. Accordingly, the PA transients are simultaneously affected by the electron extraction and hence can monitor the electron population in the highly excited states of P3HT.44 Analysis of the transients will give direct observation of interfacial charge transfer in BHJs. The TAS transients for the two different blend films are dominated by a instantaneous decaying signal contribution that accounts for approximately 90% of the peak amplitude, which is assigned to the prominent contribution from the electronic hyperpolarizability near zero delay. But the TAS transient exhibits a complicated temporal profile at the positive time delay: an ultrafast component that accounts for the TAS transient at probe delay <5 ps and is ascribed to the nonradiative relaxation of the exiton in P3HT with vibrational lifetime of τvib; a fast component in the range of 5–50 ps originates from the contribution of the electron transfer from donor to acceptor with charge transfer time constant τCT; a long tail represents the geminate recombination of electron–hole pairs that fail to fully dissociate with a recombination time constant τre. The TAS signals S(τ) can be taken as a convolution of the background-free laser pulse autocorrelation function G(t) with a linear superposition of electronic contributions ϕ(t).45,46

And ϕ(t) can be described with a superposition of the following contributions: 
ϕ(t) = δ(t) + Aexp(−t/τvib) + Bexp(−t/τCT) + Cexp(−t/τre)
(2)where δ(t) is the purely electronic hyperpolarizability that responses instantaneously to the applied laser field, A, B and C correspond to the weight of the decay components. The corresponding tri-exponential fitting parameters were summarized in Table 1. A much faster decay of the fast component in V-doped TiO2 than its counterpart TiO2 (i.e., 19.7 vs. 30.2 ps) suggests that the electron transfer becomes much faster after the incorporation of the vanadium ions. Moreover, the efficiency of the electron transfer can be estimated by the following relationship using the fitted amplitudes B/(A + B + C), i.e., 12.1% for TiO2/P3HT and 13.5% for V-doped TiO2/P3HT. Besides, a notable decrease in τre suggests that additional nonradiative electron transfer pathway in the formation of the V-doped TiO2/P3HT heterojunction was created. The TAS results are in good agreement with those of time-integrated and time-resolved PL analysis.

Now one will wonder what is held responsible for the enhancement of electron transfer after the incorporation of the vanadium ions. Note that the ‘excess’ energy offset between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of P3HT and the conduction band (CB) of TiO2, i.e., CB-LUMO energy offset, is ∼1.33 eV, which enables to break the Coulomb attraction (typically 0.1–0.5 eV)47 and to cause the initial electron transfer step, but not in an efficient way. It has been proved that an efficient charge transfer at the interface of donor and acceptor can be achieved by employing a low CB-LUMO energy offset system.48,49 In a bid to investigate the energy level control induced by the dopant, CV characteristics were performed and the results were shown in Figure S1 and Table S1.† After vanadium doping, the CB-LUMO offset is narrowed down from 1.33 to 1.02 eV as shown in Fig. 3b. Despite of the reduction of the energy offset, it is still greater than the Coulomb binding energy (typically 0.1–0.5 eV). The reduction of the ‘excess’ CB-LUMO offset should be responsible for the shorter electron transfer time at the interface of BHJ,30 indicating that the charge separation becomes more competitive than those undesired processes such as geminate recombinations and nonradiative relaxations.
The effect of vanadium species on the energy level of TiO2 was studied by varying the initial loading of sodium metavanadate (Fig. S2†) and Mott–Schottky plots together with UV-vis spectra were also used to separately determine the CB and VB positions of acceptors with or without incorporating vanadium species. The results show that with the increase of sodium metavanadate, both the CB and VB energy levels of acceptor were substantially elevated (Table S2†), indicating that it indeed plays an important role of energy level alignment in this work. For given identical initial loading of sodium metavanadate, for example at 5 wt%, the CB, VB and band gap Eg obtained from the CV characteristics are in reasonable agreement with those determined from the UV-vis and Mott–Schottky plots.
3.2. Structural analysis
The crystalline phases of V-doped TiO2 were determined by XRD pattern and the results are shown in Fig. 4a. The diffraction peaks at 25.482°, 37.753° and 48.015°, which are consistent with the standard pattern of JCPDS 01-084-1285, can be assigned to the anatase phase of TiO2. The peaks located at 27.702°, 36.259°, 41.478° and 56.555° are attributed to tetragonal phase of TiVO4 according to the standard pattern of JCPDS 01-077-0332. To further confirm the doping of vanadium ions into TiO2 lattice, the EDS spectrum was measured and shown in Fig. 4b. It reveals that the elements V, O, Ti are clearly observed. The van der Waals radii of six-coordinated V4+ ion (∼1.5 Å) is much closer to that of Ti4+ (∼1.6 Å), implying that V4+ ions are easier to substitute for Ti4+ sites and enter into TiO2 lattice.50 Moreover, the SEM image of V-doped TiO2 in Fig. 4c reveals that the small amount of the vanadium species (mainly in the form of TiVO4) obtained at the initial loading of sodium metavanadate at 5 wt% can be uniformly dispersed within titania particles of 20 nm in diameter, possibly either on the surface or the insertion of vanadium ions into the titania lattice. In addition, the porous and loose structure of TiO2 film (Fig. 4d) that almost does not change after vanadium doping can allow a large number of P3HT molecules to permeate into TiO2 film and ensure the intimate interface of donor–acceptor system in virtue of intermolecular attractive forces,51–56 thus benefiting solar light harvest.57

3.3. Device performances
To quantitatively compare the charge-transfer resistance activities of HSCs with or without vanadium dopant, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were carried out under the almost identical cells.58,59 Fig. 5a shows the Nyquist plots of the two types of cells, in which the impedance characteristics of bare TiO2 and V-doped TiO2 are demonstrated and two semicircles are observed in each EIS curve. The small semicircle is associated with the charge transfer resistance (Rct1) at the Pt/PEDOT:PSS interface while the large semicircle represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct2) at TiO2 (or V-doped TiO2)/PEDOT:PSS interface. The EIS data were fitted based on the equivalence model (as highlighted in the insert of Fig. 5a). After the incorporation of vanadium ions into TiO2, a notable decrease of Rct2 is observed (from 21.82 to 12.83 Ω), whereas Rct1 and the Rs (the series resistance stemming from the contact resistance of PEDOT:PSS and the electrodes) are slightly affected only, i.e., from 2.66 to 2.46 Ω and from 18.68 to 19.60 Ω, respectively. Lower charge transfer resistance ensures that the photoexcited electrons have enough time to reach electrode before non-geminate recombination occurs. The cross-section of the BHJ was characterized by SEM as shown in Fig. 5c. The cross-sectional image indicates that the P3HT molecules are well permeated into the porous V-doped TiO2 film. The intimate interface between P3HT and TiO2 favors an efficient charge separation in BHJs. The photovoltaic characteristics of the BHJs with or without vanadium dopant are shown Fig. 5b, and the parameters are summarized in Table 2. As observed from Fig. 5b and Table 2, with increasing the initial loading amounts of sodium metavanadate from 0 wt% to 5 wt%, both the open circuit voltage Voc and short circuit current density Jsc increase gradually, from 0.669 to 0.764 V and from 6.97 to 7.80 mA cm−2, respectively. Correspondingly, the PCE has increased from 2.00% to a maximum efficiency of 3.01% at 5 wt%. However, when the initial loading of the vanadium species (i.e., sodium metavanadate) exceeds 5 wt% and increases up to 7 wt%, the conversion efficiency surprisingly decreases as demonstrated in Table 2. Besides, the IPCE (i.e., external quantum efficiency) measurements were also performed to investigate the effect of the initial loading of the vanadium species on the device performances. Similar trend (to J–V characteristics in Fig. 5b) can be observed for IPCE measurements as shown in Fig. 6: on one hand, the IPCE of the devices fabricated from vanadium-doped TiO2 is higher than that made from pure TiO2 without doping, which can give a hint of the broadened absorption spectrum and at least partly explain the finally enhanced photovoltaic parameters such as Jsc; on the other hand, among those devices made from vanadium-doped TiO2, IPCE exhibits the best performance at 5 wt% of the initial loading of sodium metavanadate, however, IPCE decreases when exceeding up to 7 wt%, thus the optimum initial loading amount of vanadium species in this work is 5 wt%. This decrease may be ascribed to the quenching of the luminescence that arises from the introducing of deleterious cross-relaxation by elevated doping levels.60 Therefore, when the initial loading of sodium metavanadate is 5 wt% relative to the amount of TiO2, the device exhibits the best performances. The enhanced Jsc from 6.97 to 7.80 mA cm−2 after doping can be ascribed to the reduction of the ‘excess’ energy offset and hence the faster electron transfer between donor and acceptor and lower charge transfer resistance. In addition, the Voc is influenced by a number of factors in eqn (S1 and S2),† one of which is the energy offset between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and CB of the acceptor, i.e., CB-HOMO energy offset.61 It is worth mentioning that the CB-HOMO energy offset has been enlarged by ∼0.31 eV, which may provide some insight into the slightly increased Voc (i.e., from 0.669 to 0.764 V).

Finally, the final concentration of vanadium species in V-doped TiO2 was determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The sodium metavanadate aqueous solution is used as standard liquid to determine the concentration of vanadium in V-doped TiO2 at the optimized content of vanadium species at 5 wt%. By fitting the ICP peak intensity of standard liquid (Fig. 7a), the linear relationship between the peak intensity and the concentration is revealed in Fig. 7b. Then the residual concentration of vanadium ions prepared from the V-doped TiO2 is derived to be 4.63 mg L−1. Therefore, after an equivalent mathematical conversion, the final vanadium concentration in V–TiO2 is estimate to be about 0.69 wt%.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the incorporation of vanadium ions into solution-processed TiO2 colloid has proved a promising approach for tailoring the energy level alignment of the BHJ. The time-integrated PL, time-resolved PL and femtosecond TAS characterizations reveal that electron transfer at the interface of BHJ has been boosted and the transfer lifetime has been shortened by 34.7% from 30.2 to 19.7 ps after the vanadium doping with an initial loading at 5 wt%. The acceleration of electron transfer rate is ascribed to the reduction of the ‘excess’ CB-LUMO offset accelerates the charge transfer rate, thus decreasing the energy losses in the charge separation process. The photovoltaic performance was correspondingly enhanced: the highest PCE of 3.01% was obtained from the HSC using the V-doped TiO2 electrode at the optimized 5.0 wt%, whereas only 2.00% was obtained from pure TiO2. With the development of more robust materials (e.g., more reactive ions), even faster charge transfer can be achieved to pursue much higher efficiency. This research opens a gateway to develop future generation solar cells, photon detectors and other nanoscale devices with fast electron transfer.
