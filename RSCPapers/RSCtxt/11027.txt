    , Accepted 7th December 2015First published on 8th December 2015AbstractIncorporating multiple imaging modalities and simultaneous therapeutic functions together into one single nano-formulation is of great importance for developing high-performance clinical-translatable theranostic agents. Herein, we fabricated multifunctional lipid-micelles incorporated with semiconducting polymer dots and a photosensitizer (referred as Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles) for combined magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photodynamic (PDT)/photothermal (PTT) dual-modal therapy that induced by a single laser to achieve enhanced cancer therapeutic efficiency. The Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles with excellent water dispersibility were comprised of a core with poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzo-thiadiazole)] dots (Pdots) and Ce6 molecules inside, and a lipid–PEG outlayer conjugated with gadolinium-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid. The prepared Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles exhibited extremely low cytotoxicity, and had excellent MR- and PA-imaging contrast-enhancement ability, which could synchronously offer anatomical information and morphological information of tumors. Moreover, both Pdots and Ce6 photosensitizer, encapsulated inside the lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles, exhibited high NIR absorption at 670 nm and were applied to combine photothermal and photodynamic therapy simultaneously to achieve enhanced synergistic cancer therapeutic efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, our studies demonstrated that Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles with multi-diagnosis modalities and simultaneous dual-modal photo-therapy functions might be a potential interesting theranostic platform for tumor treatment.
1. Introduction
Photo-therapy is a non-invasive therapeutic technique with many advantages such as remote controllability, improved selectivity, and low systematic toxicity.1 Photothermal therapy (PTT), which is based on the conversion of electromagnetic wave energy to local hyperthermia by photoabsorbing agents, has been reported to be an efficient treatment approach to destroy malignant carcinomas under laser irradiation;2 moreover, photodynamic therapy (PDT), which can transform endogenous oxygen to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) by a photosensitizer to induce the apoptosis of cancer cells upon appropriate laser irradiation, has also been clinically applied to treat different tumors.3 Photosensitizers and photoabsorbing agents, which could be activated by a near infrared (NIR) laser (650–900 nm), have attracted intensive interests recently.3–5 However, several types of photosensitizers or photoabsorbing agents, such as indocyanine green6 and carbon-based7,8 or gold-based9,10 materials, have limitations such as photo-bleaching, self-destruction, as well as being poorly bio-metabolized or exhibiting ion-induced toxicity.11 Moreover, most photosensitizers are inclined to rapidly over-consume tissue oxygen, causing severe local hypoxia and then stopping the production of 1O2 upon laser irradiation.12–14 These limitations have so far hindered the therapeutic efficacy and restricted further clinical applications.13
Recently, researchers have found that combination of PDT and PTT together is an effective strategy for enhanced cancer therapy, which could significantly reduce the limitations of each therapeutic modality.15–18 Unfortunately, due to the absorption mismatch of photosensitizers and photoabsorbing agents at the NIR region, most studies have used different lasers to induce PDT and PTT separately. To simplify this complicated treatment procedure, Chen's group established a new photosensitizer-loaded gold nanocarrier system for cancer imaging and PDT/PTT treatment using a single laser irradiation.19,20 Although gold-based theranostic platform intrinsically with both diagnostic imaging ability and therapeutic capability has attracted considerable attention recently, the clinical usage of these agents is still hindered by some limitations, such as the sophisticated synthetic process and the heavy metal ion-induced long-term toxicity.9,21–23 Compared with the inorganic nanomaterials, organic-based nanoparticles (lipid/liposome-based nanoparticles such as polymeric micelles of liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil)24 and albumin-bound paclitaxel nanomicelles25,26) have been approved or are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of human cancers. In addition, lipid/liposome-based nanocarriers with excellent biocompatibility and loading capacity have been developed for delivering photosensitizers and photoabsorbing agents.27–31 Both PTT and PDT require a precise irradiation region confined to the tumor site to minimize the side effects. Therefore, the exact information of a tumor, such as location, distribution, size, shape, boundary, even the biological environment, must be identified before any treatment.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most powerful diagnostic imaging tools due to its capability of providing whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging data and timely feedback information of disease tissue, especially in soft tissues.32,33 However, unenhanced MRI has the drawbacks of low-contrast resolution and low sensitivity, which is not enough to provide precise information at the boundary of lesions;34 however, contrast-enhanced MRI could further provide more detailed anatomical information with high quality and sensitivity.35T1 contrast agents of Gd3+ complexes have been predominantly used in clinical MR imaging due to their high contrast enhancing capability without the disruption of magnetic homogeneity.36 However, MRI has certain limitations, such as relatively slow imaging speed, high cost, and inconvenience for general intra-operative usage. Compared with MRI, photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a novel optical imaging method, which is based on the measurement of ultrasonic waves generated by the targets with the absorption of short laser pulses to probe the structure details, functional changes, and molecular states of biological specimens.37,38 By the combination of spectral selectivity of laser and the deep spatial penetration of ultra-sound, PAI could visualize the lesions at unprecedented depth with high contrast resolution and sensitivity.
Considering that each imaging modality possesses its own characteristic advantages and weaknesses, multi-modal imaging has recently attracted extensive attention in biomedical research due to its ability to provide more comprehensive information for accurate diagnosis. As for the combination of MRI and PAI, MRI can rapidly scan to identify potential lesion locations, whereas PAI can provide information such as high-resolution morphological structure and quantitative information of the plaque inflammation.
Poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzo-thiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT) is a semiconducting π-conjunction polymer that has been widely utilized as an electron donor for polymer–fullerene solar cells.39 Recently, it has also been used in biomedical applications because it is completely organic without any heavy metal ion-induced toxicities; Rao's group fabricated a PCPDTBT nanohybrid (SPN1) with an excellent photoacoustic effect for in vivo photoacoustic molecular imaging.40 Interestingly, we discovered that the PCPDTBT nano-dots also exhibited an excellent NIR absorption, with a peak at 670 nm; the strong NIR absorption of Pdots might be utilized as a potential new photoabsorbing agent for photothermal therapy. Previously, we have reported polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles conjugated with chlorin e6 as dual-modal therapeutic agents for enhanced cancer therapy through two separated laser irradiations (670 nm and 808 nm).16 Herein, we fabricated photosensitizer (Ce6) and PCPDTBT dots (Pdots) co-loaded lipid-micelles, which are constructed from the self-assembly of gadolinium-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid modified phospholipid–PEG lipids (referred to as lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles), for MRI/PAI dual-modal cancer imaging and simultaneously combined PDT/PTT therapy through a single laser irradiation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT), chlorin e6 (Ce6), N-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)-N-ethylcarbo-diimide hydrochloride (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), 9,10-anthracenediylbis (methylene) dimalonic acid (ABDA) and 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH–DA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The molecular weight of PCPDTBT is 7000–20000 (Mw). 2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (H2N–PEG–DSPE) and 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (HSPC) were purchased from Nanocs. 1,4,7,10-Tetraacetic acid mono-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (DOTA–NHS) was purchased from Macrocyclics. LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit was purchased from Invitrogen (Eugene, OR, USA). Annexin V-fluoroisothio cyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis detection kit and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) were purchased from Dojindo Laboratories. Deionized water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm was obtained from a Milli-Q Gradient System (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and used for all the experiments. Unless specified, all other chemicals were commercially available and used as received.
2.2. Cell culture
The human hepatocellular carcinoma cancer cell line HepG2 and the NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA, USA) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) at 37 °C under a humid atmosphere (5% CO2).
2.3. Synthesis of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles
The Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles were prepared by a matrix-encapsulation method.41 First, lipid–DOTA (DSPE–PEG–DOTA) was prepared by our previously reported method through the amide reaction of the –NH2 terminal group of DSPE–PEG with the –NHS group of DOTA–NHS.42 Subsequently, the prepared lipid–DOTA was mixed with GdCl3 to obtain lipid–Gd–DOTA (DSPE–PEG–DOTA–Gd) through the chelation of Gd(III). The 1H NMR investigation of lipid–Gd–DOTA was performed to demonstrate the successful coupling of DOTA–NHS and DSPE–PEG. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the peaks assigned to lipid–PEG (δ 3.64, 1.25, and 0.88 ppm) and DOTA–NHS (δ 1.59, 1.25, and 0.83 ppm) were present in the 1H NMR of the lipid–Gd–DOTA (DSPE–PEG–DOTA–Gd). Subsequently, 1 mL of the tetrahydrofuran mixture solution containing PCPDTBT (0.25 mg), chlorin e6 (Ce6) (0.5 mg), HSPC (2.5 mg), and lipid–Gd–DOTA (0.5 mg) was rapidly injected into 10 mL Milli-Q water, followed by sonication for 1.5 min at 40 W output using a microtip probe sonicator. The mixture was then stirred at 600 rpm at room temperature in dark overnight for evaporation of tetrahydrofuran solution. The suspension of the formed nanomicelles was then dialyzed against deionized water for 48 h (MWCO = 14000 Da) to remove excess Ce6 and PCPDTBT dots. Subsequently, the obtained products (Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles) were resuspended in Milli-Q water, and the concentration was adjusted from 0.1 mg mL−1 (Pdots, 16 μg mL−1; Ce6, 24 μg mL−1) to 1 mg mL−1 (Pdots, 160 μg mL−1; Ce6, 240 μg mL−1). The amount of loaded Ce6 or PCPDTBT dots was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm in DMSO or at 698 nm in THF, respectively. The amount of Gd was determined through XSERIES 2 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Thermo, USA). To serve as a control, analogous micelles, but without Ce6 and Gd–DOTA (referred as Pdots@lipid micelles), were also prepared. The synthesis procedure of the Pdots@lipid micelles was similar to that of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles, with replacing the lipid–Gd–DOTA by lipid–PEG, and without loading Ce6. In addition, other micelles without Gd–DOTA (referred to as Pdots/Ce6@lipid micelles) were also prepared. The synthesis procedure of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid micelles was also similar to that of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles, but the lipid–Gd–DOTA was replaced by lipid–PEG.
2.4. Characterization of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles
TEM was performed using a JEM-2010 electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) to characterize the overall morphology and the chemical compositions of the nanomicelles. DLS experiments were performed at 25 °C on a Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Malvern UK) with a detection angle of 173° and a 3 mW He–Ne laser operating at the wavelength of 633 nm. Briefly, 1 mL dispersion of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles (0.05 mg mL−1) was placed into a glass cuvette, and then the sample was measured; the average value was obtained from 3 replicate measurements for each sample; the PDI values were obtained by analyzing the correlation functions through cumulants analysis. Zeta potential measurements were performed at 25 °C on the Nano ZS using the M3-PALS technology. The FT-IR spectrum of the prepared Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles was collected on a FT-IR spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, USA). Here, the samples were mixed with KBr, compressed to a plate, and evaluated over the spectral region of 400 to 4000 cm−1. The Vis-NIR absorption spectra of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles were measured by a Vis-NIR spectrometer (Spectro Max M5e, Germany).
2.5. Temperature elevation and ROS generation under 670 nm laser irradiation
To study the photothermal effect of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles, a 2 mL aqueous solution of the lipid-micelles was irradiated by a 670 nm laser with a power density of 0.5 W cm−2. The temperature of the solution was monitored by a thermocouple microprobe (Φ = 0.5 mm) (STPC-510P, Xiamen Baidewo Technology Co., China) that was submerged in the solution every 10 s. ROS generation of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles was measured through using ABDA as an indicator. Briefly, the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles (Ce6: 24 μg mL−1) in Milli-Q water containing 20 mM ABDA was irradiated by a 670 nm laser with a power intensity of 0.5 W cm−2 for 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 min, respectively; subsequently, the absorbance change of ABDA from 300 to 450 nm was measured by a UV-Vis spectrometer (Spectro Max M5e, Germany).
2.6. 
          In vitro cellular uptake measurement by flow cytometry
HepG2 cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells per well, and incubated in a humidity atmosphere with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then, the original medium was replaced with a fresh culture medium containing 0.05 mg mL−1 Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles (Pdots, 8 μg mL−1; Ce6, 12 μg mL−1). After incubating for 1, 2, 3 and 4 h, the cells were washed three times with PBS solution, and then dispersed in 1 mL PBS. Then, the cells were filtered through a 40 microns nylon mesh to remove cell aggregates before fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Fluorescence measurement of the intracellular Ce6 was carried out in the FL4 channel with excitation at 670 nm.16
2.7. Confocal microscopy studies of the cellular uptake of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles
The uptake of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles by HepG2 cells was investigated by confocal microscopy. HepG2 cells (5 × 104) were seeded into 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C in the incubator. Then, the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles were added to the cells and further incubated for 3 h. Then, propidium iodide (PI) was added into the Petri dishes, which were then incubated in the dark for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the HepG2 cells were washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4) at room temperature and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Finally, the cells were imaged by a confocal microscope (LSM 780, USA) with 543 nm laser excitation for Ce6.
2.8. 
          In vitro cytotoxicity analysis and the photodynamic/photothermal ablation of cancer cells
The cytotoxicity of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles was evaluated on HepG2 cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells using a Cell Counting Kit (CCK8). The cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well and incubated under a humid atmosphere (with 5% CO2) for 24 h. Then, the original medium was replaced with a fresh culture medium containing Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles at a final Pdots concentration ranging from 1 to 16 μg mL−1. Moreover, the cells incubated with cell culture medium only were prepared as the untreated control. The medium was aspirated after 48 h incubation, and the cells were washed twice with 100 μL PBS solution. Subsequently, 100 μL of culture medium and 10 μL of CCK8 solution were added to the wells. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, the absorbance of the solution in each well at 450 nm was measured with a microplate reader (Spectra Max M5e, Germany). The proliferation of cells was determined by the absorption intensity. Cell viability was expressed as follows: cell viability (%) = (OD sample − OD blank)/(OD control − OD blank) × 100%, where the OD sample and OD control are the absorbance values of the treated cells (as indicated) and the untreated control cells (without nanoparticles), respectively. The OD blank is the absorbance of the CCK8 reagent itself at 450 nm. All the experiments were performed in quadruplicate.
To investigate the photo-killing efficiency of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles, HepG2 cells were first seeded into a 96-well plate at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h. Then, the cells were washed three times with PBS to remove dead cells, followed by incubation with different concentrations of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles, Pdots@lipid micelles and Ce6 dispersed in RPMI-1640 medium at 37 °C for 3 h. Next, the cells were washed three times with PBS buffer. Then, the cells were exposed to 670 nm laser (0.5 W cm−2) for 5 min. After laser irradiation, the cells were incubated with fresh RPMI-1640 culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, the cell viability was determined by CCK8 according to the above-mentioned procedure.
Localized photo-killing effects of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles were also evaluated on HepG2 cells as follows: HepG2 cells were first seeded into a 6-well plate at a density of 1 × 106 cells per well at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h. Then, the cells were washed three times with PBS to remove dead cells, followed by incubation with Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles, Pdots@lipid micelles, or Ce6 (all at the Ce6 concentration of 2.4 μg mL−1) dispersed in culture medium at 37 °C for 3 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed by PBS buffer to remove non-uptaken micelles, and then exposed to 670 nm laser (0.5 W cm−2) for 5 min. After laser irradiation, the cells were incubated with fresh culture medium at 37 °C for 2 h. Then, the cells were stained with a LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit for the visualization of live and death cells. Subsequently, we used the Annexin-V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) staining method to further evaluate cell apoptosis induced by the photothermal/photodynamic treatment of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles. Briefly, HepG2 cells were first seeded into a 6-well plate at a density of 1 × 106 cells per well at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h. Then, the cells were washed three times with PBS to remove dead cells, followed by incubation with Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles, Pdots@lipid micelles, and Ce6 (Ce6, 2.4 μg mL−1) dispersed in culture medium at 37 °C for 3 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS buffer to remove non-uptaken micelles, and then exposed to 670 nm laser (0.5 W cm−2) for 5 min. After laser irradiation, the cells were incubated with fresh culture medium at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, the cells were collected and resuspended in 500 μL of binding buffer, and Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) were added following the manufacturer's recommendation. Samples were incubated in the dark for 15 min at room temperature and then analyzed using flow cytometry.
2.9. 
          In vitro and in vivo MRI measurements
Aqueous dispersions of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles at different concentration were investigated using T1/T2-weighted MRI on a 9.4 T small animal MRI scanner (Bruker Avance II 500 WB spectrometer) to evaluate the contrast-enhancement effect. T1/T2-weighted imaging was performed using an inversion recovery gradient echo sequence with TE = 4 ms, a slice thickness of 0.5 mm, a field of view (FOV) of 3.0 × 3.0 cm, and a matrix size of 128 × 128. Injected dimeglumine gadopentetate (a commercial MRI contrast agent) was used as a control. MRI imaging data of the tumor site were collected before and after 2 h of the intra-tumoral injection of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles (100 μL, 0.1 mg mL−1).
2.10. 
          In vitro and in vivo photoacoustic imaging

In vivo PA imaging was carried out on HepG2 tumor-bearing nude mice (22–24 g). The photoacoustic signals were excited using a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (LS-2137/2, LOTIS TII, Minsk, Belarus) and a pumped tunable Ti:sapphire laser (LT-45 2211A, LOTIS TII, Minsk, Belarus). An unfocused ultrasonic transducer with a central frequency of 2.25 MHz was used to detect the photoacoustic signals at 680 nm. Before imaging, the mouse was first anesthetized and placed on a homemade shelf. Then, a thin layer of ultrasonic coupling gel was coated on the tumor, and then the tumor was placed on a bulge at the tank's bottom and the bulge site was immersed in water. PA-imaging data of the tumor site was collected before and after the intra-tumoral injection of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles (100 μL, 0.1 mg mL−1).
2.11. Tumor xenograft and in vivo photodynamic/photothermal therapy
Male nude mice with immunodeficiency and body weight of ∼26 g from China Wushi Inc. (Shanghai, China) were used for animal studies. All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Fujian Medical University. Tumor-bearing nude mice were prepared by subcutaneously injecting a suspension of the HepG2 cells (107 cells) in sterilized 1 × PBS. When the tumor size reached 130–170 mm3, 0.1 mg mL−1 of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles (with Pdots concentration of 16 μg mL−1, or Ce6 concentration of 24 μg mL−1; 50 μL injection of each mouse) were intra-tumorally injected into each mouse (n = 5). One group of mice treated with the same volume of sterilized PBS was taken as the control. The mice were segregated into 4 groups: (1) PBS-treated groups with 670 nm (0.5 W cm−2) laser irradiation for 10 min (n = 5); (2) Ce6-treated groups with 670 nm (0.5 W cm−2) laser irradiation for 10 min (n = 5); (3) Pdots@lipid-treated groups with 670 nm (0.5 W cm−2) laser irradiation for 10 min (n = 5); (4) Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA-treated with 670 nm (0.5 W cm−2) laser irradiation for 10 min (n = 5). The irradiation was conducted after 2 h of injection. The therapeutic effects were evaluated by monitoring the tumor volume and body weight changes in each group every two days up to 19 days. The size of the tumors was measured by calipers every other day after the treatment. The volume of tumor (V) was calculated by the following equation: V = A × B2/2, where A and B are the longer and shorter diameters (mm) of the tumor, respectively.
2.12. Histological examination and long-term toxicity assessment
To examine the histological changes of the tumors, one tumor-bearing mouse in each group was sacrificed after 24 h of laser irradiation, and the tumors were collected, and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histopathology evaluation and Ki67 antibody for immunohistochemical analysis. To assess the long-term systematic toxicities of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles, the lipid-micelles-treated Balb/c mice were sacrificed at the time point of 0, 1, 8, and 20 days after intravenous injection of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles (Pdots, 16 μg mL−1; Ce6, 24 μg mL−1; 100 μL injection of each mouse) via the tail vein, and the major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lungs and kidney) of the mice were then collected, fixed in 4% neutral formaldehyde, conducted with paraffin-embedded sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and observed under a Zeiss microscope (Axio Lab.A1).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles
In this study, Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles were prepared by the matrix-encapsulation method41 (Fig. 1A). First, gadolinium-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (Gd–DOTA) was conjugated with [polyethylene glycol-2000]-2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (lipid–PEG) to obtain lipid–Gd–DOTA as a MRI contrast agent, according to our pervious studies.42 Second, the lipid–Gd–DOTA was added into the THF solution containing semiconducting polymers of poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT), chlorin e6 (Ce6) and 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (HSPC) (at a mass ratio of 2:1:2:5). Subsequently, the mixture was rapidly injected into water and subjected to sonication. The semiconducting polymer of PCPDTBT dots (Pdots) and Ce6 molecules were co-loaded into the lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles via π–π stacking and hydrophobic interaction. The drug-loading efficiency of Pdots and Ce6 in the micelles were 16 wt% and 24 wt%, respectively, which was determined by the absorbance of PCPDTBT in THF at 698 nm and Ce6 in DMSO at 405 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†), respectively. To verify the successful synthesis of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles, Vis-NIR spectra of free Ce6 in DMSO, Pdots@lipid micelles, and Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles were obtained, as shown in Fig. 1B. Compared with the absorbance of Pdots@lipid micelles (red lines), Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles (black lines) exhibited higher absorption peaks at 405 nm (Soret peak) and 675 nm (Q-band), corresponding to the characteristic absorption peak of free Ce6 (green lines), indicating the successful loading of Ce6 molecules. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles could be well dispersed in an aqueous solution, demonstrating an average diameter of 36 ± 8 nm (Fig. 1C). The enlarged photography provided the details that the amount of punctate pattern relating to the Pdots (black dot) with sizes of 3–4 nm were uniformly distributed in the interior of the micelles (Fig. 1D and Fig. S3, ESI†). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies showed that the average hydrodynamic size of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles was 111.5 ± 3.16 nm (Fig. 2A). The PDI of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles was determined to be 0.289 by DLS, indicating a relatively narrow size distribution. The larger size of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles determined by DLS than the size determined by TEM is mainly attributed to the slight aggregation of these micelles in water.

To further investigate the influence of lipid–Gd–DOTA on the zeta potential of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles, Pdots/Ce6@lipid micelles without Gd–DOTA were synthesized as the same way as mentioned in the above-described procedure (full details given in the Experimental section). As shown in Fig. 2B, Pdots@lipid micelles without Ce6 molecules loaded exhibited a negative surface charge (−17.16 ± 1.4 mV) in aqueous solution at pH 7.4, which is ascribed to the phosphate anion in the polar head of HSPC. After loading Ce6, the zeta potential of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid micelles (ζ) turned to −38.8 ± 4.2 mV. However, the zeta potential switched to 2.9 ± 0.7 mV after assembling with the neutral charged lipid–Gd–DOTA, because the chelated Gd(III) could neutralize the remaining three negatively charged COO− groups of lipid–DOTA so that the obtained lipid–Gd–DOTA had no charged groups in its hydrophilic heads.
To further verify the existence of Ce6 and Pdots inside the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of all the components of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles, Pdots@lipid micelles, Ce6, and PCPDTBT were obtained. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles presented a specific absorption feature, and the presence of new bands at 1594 cm−1 (N–H in-plane) and 1340 cm−1 (C–N stretching) confirmed the successful formation of amide groups by chemical conjugation of the surface carboxylic acid groups of the Gd–DOTA with the amine-terminated phospholipid–PEG. Moreover, the feature bands include the bands at 3410 cm−1 (stretching vibration of phenolic O–H and N–H), 1610 cm−1 (stretching vibration of aromatic ring and bending vibration of N–H), 1510 cm−1 (shearing vibration of N–H) and 1068 cm−1 (C–O stretching), and these spectra confirmed the successful loading of PCPDTBT dots and Ce6 photosensitizers (Fig. S4, ESI†).
3.2. Synchronous ROS generation and temperature elevation induced by 670 nm NIR laser irradiation
Previously, we have demonstrated that Pdots and Ce6 photosensitizer show high NIR absorption at 670 nm, therefore lipid-micelles prepared by us might be a promising PDT/PTT dual-modal therapeutic agent induced by a single laser for cancer therapy. ROS is primarily responsible for cell death, which is the key parameter to estimate the PDT effect. To investigate the PDT effect, we first used 9,10-anthracenediyl-bis (methylene) dimalonic acid (ABDA) as an indicator to evaluate the ROS production of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles under NIR laser irradiation. As shown in Fig. 2C and Fig. S5 (ESI†), the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles (Pdots 16 μg mL−1; Ce6 24 μg mL−1) in water and free Ce6 (24 μg mL−1) in DMSO exhibited a sharp decline in ABDA absorbance in the range of 300 to 400 nm under 670 nm laser irradiation at a power intensity of 0.5 W cm−2 for 7 min (the same laser wavelength and intensity was used in all the experiments), while there was no decrease in the absorbance with an equivalent laser power irradiation when only ABDA existed. In addition, to further confirm that the ROS is generated from the loaded Ce6 molecules, we compared the ROS production of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles with that of Pdots@lipid micelles (Pdots 16 μg mL−1) or free Ce6 (DMSO) (Ce6 24 μg mL−1) under 670 nm laser irradiation. As shown in Fig. 2D, the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles and free Ce6 (DMSO) produced almost the same amount of ROS after exposure to the laser for 11 min, but the Pdots@lipid micelles alone could not generate any ROS under the same conditions. This evidence suggests that the ROS was mainly generated from the loaded Ce6 molecules of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles. Furthermore, the photothermal conversion of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles was also carefully evaluated. As shown in Fig. 2E, the temperature of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles containing 2, 4, 8, 16 μg mL−1 of Pdots was increased up to 38.4 °C, 43.9 °C, 50.6 °C, and 53.4 °C after exposure to the laser for 10 min, respectively. At the Pdots concentration of 8 μg mL−1, the temperature was already increased up to 50.6 °C, which is sufficient to induce the necrosis of cancer cells (Fig. 2F). In contrast, the temperature of deionised water was not significantly changed (26.4 °C) when exposed to laser irradiation. These results indicated that the Pdots inside our lipid-micelles were primarily responsible for the photothermal conversion. Furthermore, the photothermal stability of the photoabsorbing agents during NIR laser irradiation is essential in PTT applications. To investigate the photothermal stability, the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles were subjected to four rounds of repeated irradiation using laser on/off cycling, as follows: the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles were irradiated by NIR laser for 500 s (laser on), followed by natural cooling to room temperature without NIR laser irradiation (laser off). As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles maintained excellent photothermal stability during repeated irradiation without experiencing any decrease in their temperature elevation ability, which suggested that the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles could act as a stable photothermal conversion agent. In summary, these results clearly indicated that the as-prepared Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelle could act as an excellent dual-modal photo-therapeutic agent with high ROS generation ability and excellent photothermal conversion ability induced by a single laser irradiation.
3.3. Evaluation of the cellular uptake of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles
Efficient internalization of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles by cancer cells is of great importance in cancer therapy. Herein, we first used flow cytometry to quantify the internalization efficiency of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles in HepG2 cells after 1, 2, 3 and 4 h incubation. As shown in Fig. 3A, the Ce6 fluorescence intensities of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA-micelles-treated HepG2 cells were increased in a time-dependent manner from 1 to 3 h, and remained unchanged after 3 h. To further confirm that the fluorescence signals come from the loaded Ce6 photosensitizer, confocal microscopy was conducted. As shown in Fig. 3B, the red fluorescence signal from the internalized Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles in HepG2 cells could be clearly observed. In contrast, the fluorescence signal of Pdots@lipid-micelles-treated HepG2 was not observed, and the red fluorescence signal of the HepG2 cells incubated with the same concentration of free Ce6 was lower than that of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA-micelles-treated cells. These data demonstrated that the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles could be effectively internalized by HepG2 cells.

(B) Confocal images of HepG2 cells incubated with free Ce6, Pdots@lipid micelles and Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles for 3 h. (Scale bar = 50 μm).

3.4. 
          In vitro phototoxicity induced cell death
Nontoxicity or low toxicity is a key criterion of any nanomaterial designed for biomedical applications. Cell viability assays (CCK8) were performed to investigate the cytotoxicity of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles in NIH-3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, both of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles and Pdots@lipid micelles showed a very low cytotoxic effect on the NIH-3T3 cells in the absence of laser irradiation, and the cells remained more than 95% viable even when the concentration was increased to 16 μg mL−1 (Pdots, Ce6 24 μg mL−1) with 48 h incubation.
As mentioned above, we demonstrated that Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles could produce significant ROS upon the laser irradiation of 670 nm in aqueous media, which could subsequently damage the cancer cells by ROS-induced cells apoptosis. Then, we examined the intracellular ROS generation by 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH–DA), which is widely applied as a ROS fluorescence indicator. As shown in Fig. 4A, the untreated control cells showed a low DCFH–DA fluorescence signal, indicating that only a few ROS was present inside the cancer cells. Moreover, neither the laser irradiation alone at 670 nm nor the presence of Pdots@lipid micelles with laser irradiation could induce additional ROS production compared with the control group. In contrast, there was a very strong DCFH–DA fluorescence signal in the cells treated with Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles under 670 nm laser irradiation, and it was considerably higher than that of free Ce6-treated cells due to the efficient cellular uptake of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles (Fig. 3B). However, without laser irradiation, the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles themselves could not produce any additional DCFH–DA fluorescence signal except for the background. These results proved that ROS could be selectively generated in the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA-micelle-treated cells upon 670 nm NIR irradiation, which could be applied as a promising agent for PDT treatment.

The power intensity of 670 nm laser is 0.5 W cm−2. (B) Cell viability of HepG2 cells treated with different concentrations of free Ce6, Pdots@lipid micelles and Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles upon 670 nm laser irradiation. Bars, mean ± SD (n = 6). (C) Fluorescence images of the live/dead viability toxicity kit stained HepG2 cells under the following conditions: HepG2 cells without treatment; HepG2 cells irradiated with laser light alone; HepG2 cells incubated with Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles without laser irradiation; HepG2 cells irradiated with 670 nm laser in the presence of free Ce6, Pdots@lipid micelles or Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles. Scale bar = 100 μm. 
Furthermore, the photothermal conversion and ROS generation of our Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles prompted us to evaluate their feasibility as a PTT/PDT dual-modal therapeutic agent. CCK8 was conducted to evaluate the cell killing efficiency induced by laser irradiation. As shown in Fig. 4B, the free Ce6 and Pdots@lipid micelles showed a dose-dependent PDT effect and PTT effect under 670 nm laser irradiation, and the viability of Ce6 (2.4 μg mL−1) or Pdots@lipid-micelles (Pdots, 1.6 μg mL−1) treated HepG2 cells was sharply decreased to 25.6% and 44.7% under 670 nm laser irradiation. Moreover, the cell viability of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA-micelles-treated HepG2 cells was further decreased to as low as 15.3% at the same concentration (Ce6, 2.4 μg mL−1; Pdots, 1.6 μg mL−1) under 670 nm laser irradiation, which indicated the excellent synergistic killing efficiency toward cancer cells. However, the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles themselves had no PTT or PDT effect against HepG2 cells without laser irradiation.
To further evaluate the localized photo-killing effect of the synergistic photo-therapy, HepG2 cells were incubated with Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles (Ce6 2.4 μg mL−1; Pdots 1.6 μg mL−1) for 3 h and subsequently irradiated with 670 nm laser. After treatment, the residual live cells were stained with a live/dead viability/cytotoxicity kit, by which the living cells show a green fluorescence and the dead cells show a red fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 4C, the HepG2 cells treated with Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles in the absence of laser irradiation or the HepG2 cells only treated with 670 nm laser irradiation without incubation with our lipid-micelles showed entire vivid green fluorescence, indicating the low cytotoxicity of our Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles. However, several cells with red fluorescence could be clearly observed within the laser spot via the ROS-induced apoptosis (PDT) upon 670 nm laser irradiation in the Ce6-treated groups. A similar phenomenon could be also observed in the Pdots@lipid-micelles-treated groups. Most significantly, almost no survived cells could be observed inside the laser spot in Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles-treated HepG2 cells in the presence of laser irradiation. These findings clearly demonstrated that the as-prepared Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles had excellent combined PDT/PTT effects against cancer cells.
To further analyze the apoptosis and necrosis of the treated cancer cells, flow cytometry analysis using Annexin-V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) staining was performed. As shown in Fig. 5, the stained cells were divided into four subgroups, the viable group (Q3), the early apoptotic group (Q4), the late apoptotic/necrotic group (Q2) and the dead cells/debris group (Q1). As shown in Fig. 5, the majority of cells were localized in the Q3 quadrant with more than 95.05% of the viable cells in the control group. Similarly, most of the cells without any treatment of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles under 670 nm laser irradiation or with the treatment of micelles but in the absence of laser irradiation still remained alive (above 90% of the viable cells). However, the percentage of viable cells was significantly decreased in the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA-micelles-treated groups under 670 nm laser irradiation (39.12% of the viable cells), in comparison with the Ce6 treated groups (60.74% of the viable cells) or Pdots@lipid micelles treated group (80.58% of the viable cells). Accordingly, the percentage of apoptotic cells in Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA-micelles-treated groups (60.42%) was considerably higher than the other two groups (38.96% in free Ce6 group and 12.56% in Pdots@lipid micelles group). These results clearly demonstrated the combined cell killing efficiency or dual-modal therapeutic effects of our Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles.

3.5. MR imaging and PA imaging of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles
Contrast-enhanced MRI is one of the most powerful tools to provide detailed anatomical information with high imaging quality for the early detection of cancer and the assessment of therapeutic responses.41 Herein, we investigated the MRI contrast-enhancement capability of our Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles on a 9.4 T MR imaging system (Siemens Magnetom Trio system). Tubes containing the various concentrations of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles were arrayed by increasing concentration, and water was placed as the control. As shown in Fig. 6A, a positive enhancement of the MRI in the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles was observed compared to water, and the T1-weighted MR images became brighter, corresponding to the increase in the concentration of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles. The T1 relaxation time for each sample at 20 °C was also analyzed, and the results indicated that the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles shortened the T1 relaxation time. Further analysis of the observed longitudinal rates revealed a linear dependence on the concentration of dispersed Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles in all the measurements (Fig. 6B). The longitudinal coefficient relaxivity value, r1, determined from the slope of the plot of 1/T1versus the sample concentration, was 75.027 mM−1 s−1. To further verify the in vivo positive MRI signal enhancement capability of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles, the prepared lipid-micelles were intra-tumorally injected into the nude mice bearing the HepG2 tumor. As shown in Fig. 6C, compared with the pre-injection tumor section, the MRI signal was significantly enhanced after intra-tumoral injection of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles, and showed a homogenous distribution of the contrast agents within the tumor. Moreover, the MRI signals of the tumor tissue were much stronger than the surrounding normal tissue, indicating that the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles have great potential for application in enhanced MR imaging of tumors.

(F) PA images of the tumor site at the time point of pre- and post-injection with Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles. 
Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is based on the detection of broadband ultrasonic waves generated from transient thermoelastic expansion after absorbing energy of the pulsed laser by photoacoustic contrast agents.43 In this study, we investigated whether our Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles could be used as a photoacoustic contrast agent, inspired from the previous report that PCPDTBT nanohybrids had excellent photoacoustic effects.40 As shown in Fig. 6D and E, the PAI signal was increased along with the increasing concentration of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles compared to the control (water). To further verify the PAI signal enhancement capability in vivo, our Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles were intra-tumorally injected into the tumor site of HepG2-tumor-bearing nude mice. As shown in Fig. 6F, a much stronger PAI signal was clearly observed in the tumor region after the intra-tumoral injection of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles. These results clearly demonstrate that our lipid-micelles would be a promising candidate for in vivo MRI and PAI.
3.6. Synchronous photodynamic/photothermal therapy of tumor-bearing mice in vivo
To evaluate the synergistic PDT/PTT effects of our Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles in vivo under single 670 nm laser irradiation, HepG2-tumor-bearing mice model with initial tumor volumes of 130–170 mm3 were chosen and randomly divided into four groups, which then received various treatments as indicated (as mentioned in the Experimental section). As shown in Fig. 7A and B, the PTT effect of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles was first studied with an IR thermal camera. Rapid temperature increases at the tumor site, which occurred with intra-tumoral injection with the Pdots@lipid micelles (51.7 °C) or Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles (52.2 °C) were clearly observed under 670 nm laser irradiation. In contrast, only a slight temperature change was observed under 670 nm laser irradiation at the tumor sites injected with Ce6 or injected with PBS as control, respectively. To investigate the antitumor efficacy of the combined PDT/PTT treatment in vivo, H&E staining and immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor tissues was performed after 24 h of treatment. Tumor tissues from PBS-treated mice were used as the control. As shown in Fig. 7C, no necrosis or obvious apoptosis was observed in the tumor tissue slices of the PBS-treated group, and the tumor cells retained their normal morphology with a distinguishable membrane and nuclear structure. The tumors received by the Ce6-treated group or Pdots@lipid-micelles-treated group showed a certain degree of tissue and cellular damage, due to the apoptosis of cancer cells induced by the PDT or PTT effect alone. It was noteworthy that the combined PDT/PTT treatment in the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA-micelles-injected group showed significant cell destruction and extensive damaged areas, as indicated by the loss of tissue architectures and decreased general intensity of tissues. Moreover, the immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of tumor sections for antigen Ki67, which is significantly expressed in the nucleus, was used to evaluate cell proliferation. As expected, the Ki67 signal from the tumor cells that received the combined treatment of PDT and PTT in the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA-micelles-treated mice was much weaker than in other groups. Moreover, inspired by the efficient cell destruction of the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA-micelles-treated mice, we conducted the tumor inhibition experiments by measuring the tumor volumes with a Vernier caliper that continuously monitored the tumors for 19 days. As shown in Fig. 7D, the mice experienced a rapid tumor growth in the PBS-treated group, indicating that PBS-treatment followed by 670 nm laser irradiation had no influence on the tumor growth. In contrast, the Ce6-treated groups with 670 nm laser irradiation showed delays in tumor growth but did not restrain the tumor growth, which might be due to the rapid over-consumption of tissue oxygen, causing severe local hypoxia to cease the production of 1O2 and impacting PDT efficiency. Although the Pdots@lipid micelles-treated group showed remarkable delays in tumor growth, it still could not restrain the tumor growth completely. However, it was noteworthy that the Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA-micelles-treated group exhibited much higher therapeutic efficiency and almost completely restrained the tumor growth over 19 days, compared with the Ce6-treated or Pdots@lipid-micelles-treated group alone. The body weights of all the groups were also recorded in our experiments after the indicated treatments. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), no obvious weight loss was observed in the Pdots@lipid-micelles- or Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA-micelles-treated groups compared with the Ce6- or PBS-treated group. These data clearly demonstrated that our Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles could serve as highly effective PDT/PTT dual-modal therapeutic agents.

All data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 4), and statistical analysis was performed with the two-tailed paired Student's t test, **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001. 
3.7. Long-term toxicity assessment of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles
The potential toxicity of nanoparticles or nanodrugs is a great concern for in vivo applications, and it has been proved that pathological changes are an indicator for treatment-induced toxicity. We next observed the pathological changes of major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) through H&E staining at 0, 1, 8, and 20 day post the i.v. injection of Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles (100 μL per mouse, 0.1 mg mL−1). PBS solution was set as the control. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), there was no noticeable tissue damaging in all major organs, in comparison with the control groups. The abovementioned results showed that Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles were nontoxic at a therapeutic dose (100 μL, 0.1 mg mL−1).
4. Conclusions
In this study, we successfully developed Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles as a multifunctional theranostic agent for MR/PA dual-modal imaging and synchronous PDT/PTT treatment of liver cancers. The Pdots embedded into micelles exhibited a strong PAI signal and high photothermal conversion ability and stability, and the Gd–DOTA modified on the outer layer showed a significant MRI enhancement ability, whereas the loaded Ce6 could achieve significant ROS generation under the same laser irradiation as PTT. The MR/PA dual-modal imaging signals of our micelles in the tumor could be nicely observed both in vitro and in vivo. An antitumor study confirmed that the as-prepared Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles show a significantly improved tumor killing efficacy, compared with the Pdots@lipid micelles or free Ce6 alone under 670 nm laser irradiation, which demonstrated the synchronous PDT/PTT therapeutic effects of our micelles. Therefore, the as-prepared Pdots/Ce6@lipid–Gd–DOTA micelles might be used as a promising theranostic agent for MR/PA dual-modal imaging and the synchronous PDT/PTT treatment of liver cancer.
