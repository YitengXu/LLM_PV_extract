An oxyethylene macrocyclic spacer, attached to meta-positions of side phenyl groups of bis(styryl)benzene, was linked to [60]fullerene through a synthesis based on the nucleophilic Bingel cyclopropanation of the fullerenes. The dyad structure was confirmed by 1H, 13C and HR-FAB mass spectra. The UV-Vis spectrum of the dyad is the superimposition of those of appropriate model systems, indicating that ground-state electronic interactions between the constituent chromophores, in solution, are negligible, in line also with the electrochemical results. Molecular modelling studies and NMR data suggest that the bis(styryl)benzene moves back and forth at room temperature from one side of the fullerene to the other. Interestingly, the overall power conversion efficiency (η) calculated for solar cells made of the bis(styryl)benzene–fullerene dyad was 0.022% under a white-light irradiation power of 86 mW cm−2. This is, to our knowledge, the highest value reported, under high-level irradiation conditions, for solar cells based on dyads in which a fullerene is tethered to a phenylenevinylene structure.1. IntroductionPlastic solar cells, made of an interpenetrating, bicontinuous network1 of an electron donor conjugated polymer (D) and an electron acceptor functionalized fullerene (A) have shown potential to harness solar energy effectively2, although low efficiency still limits their viability for commercial uses.3 However, following the fast growth of research in organic materials for solar energy conversion,4 key bottleneck factors to high-efficiency, such as photon losses, exciton losses or charge carrier mobility,3 especially that of the holes in donor polymers,5 have become clear. Efforts are therefore made to minimize these losses through the realization of nano-structured heterojunctions6 by controlling, for instance, the self-organization of the D/A components.7 Currently, the best conjugated polymer-based solar cells, reported in the literature, are those obtained by mixing poly(3-hexyl)thiophene and a soluble functionalized fullerene that gave a power conversion efficiency approaching 5% under standard test conditions.7cAlternative approaches to fullerene–polymer blends have been actively pursued as well by several groups.8 In the so-called double cable approach,9 for instance, functionalized fullerenes (n-cable) are tethered to a conjugated polymer backbone (p-cable). The covalent grafting of the active components of the solar cell would prevent, at least in principle, either extensive phase segregation10 or unwanted ground state electronic interactions between D and A chromophores. Both electropolymerized11 and solution processable11b,12 conjugated polymers with pendant fullerenes have been prepared and, in a few cases, tested in photovoltaic devices. Power conversion efficiency values of about 0.1%, under white light illumination of 100 mW cm−2 intensity, were reported for a methanofullerene covalently linked to a copolymer made of poly(p-phenylene)vinylene and poly(p-phenylene)ethynylene.12a The optimization of the fullerene mole fraction remains, most likely, the major challenge for the development of efficient double cable, fullerene-based solar cells.9 It has been reported that a fullerene content as high as 80 wt% would ensure best performance for poly[2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylene]vinylene (MDMO-PPV)–fullerene derivative solar cells.13 More recently, it has been found that a 1∶1 wt∶wt fullerene–polymer ratio in the active layer yielded balanced electron and hole transport in cells where poly(3-hexylthiophene) was the donor.7b To our knowledge, no soluble double cable materials, having such a large concentration of fullerene, have been reported yet.Other promising approaches to plastic solar cells followed the considerable development of the chemistry of the fullerenes.14 They include the use of molecular dyads and triads made of a functionalized fullerene covalently linked to oligomeric, conjugated architectures that showed power conversion efficiencies ranging from about 10−2% to our reported 0.37%, under 80 mW cm−2 white light illumination, for a fullerene–azothiophene dyad.15 In this connection, the first example of a single-component solar cell based on a fullerene–bis(styryl)benzene conjugate was reported in 1999 by J.-F. Nierengarten and co-workers.16 Recently, accounts have been published17 in which sections are devoted to some aspects of this subject.Several groups reported the synthesis and photophysical properties of triad ensembles.18 Also, a wide variety of other donor-linked fullerenes have been proposed in which the donor moiety is, for instance, a functionalized oligo(phenylene)vinylene,16,19 a Zn-phthalocyanine,20 a dihexyloxybenzene-thiophene structure,21 a functionalized oligo(phenylene)ethynylene22 or an azoaromatic dye.15,23 It is worth mentioning that a general phenomenon in fullerene-based D–A dyads is the competition between energy and electron transfer.18a,19a,24 This issue can be tackled by designing D–A molecular systems characterized by a branching ratio between the two processes markedly in favor of the charge transfer, which is the essential prerequisite for photovoltaic applications.20,25 Both theory and experiment indicate that donor–acceptor distance26 and orientation play a pivotal role in controlling the photoinduced electron transfer and consequently the efficiency of charge separation and the lifetime of the charge separated state. To this end, the groups of R. A. J. Janssen, J. Roncali and co-workers developed a set of complementary dyads, where the β-position of terminal thiophene rings, in a tetrathiophene moiety, was connected to a functionalized fullerene in a single or double fashion.27 The macrocyclic thiophene–fullerene conjugate showed rate constants for energy and charge transfer that were more than one order of magnitude larger than those observed for the flexible system. Schuster and co-workers28 investigated the topological control of the intramolecular electron transfer in a symmetrical parachute-shaped porphyrin–fullerene dyad. Molecular modelling suggested that the porphyrin moves over the side of the fullerene sphere, bringing the two in close proximity. The efficient and rapid quenching of the porphyrin luminescence, followed by the formation of either the fullerene excited triplet state or the charge separated state, revealed that the above mentioned conformation facilitates through-space interactions between D and A. Guldi and co-workers29 studied the effect of orientation of a Zn-porphyrin and a fullerene moiety on electron transfer rates: π–π interactions was confirmed to be the crucial parameter that controls rates, efficiency and mechanism of electron transfer from the porphyrin to the fullerene.In this paper we report the synthesis, electrochemistry and photovoltaic properties of a fullerene–bis(styryl)benzene dyad 1 in which the flexible macrocyclic oxyethylene spacer might allow the two chromophores to arrange in a conformation where the reciprocal orientation and distance are the most favorable for the electron transfer process.2. ExperimentalSynthesesMaterials. All reagents for the synthesis, including dry solvents, were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. Bis(phosphonium chloride) 4 was prepared as reported in the literature.30Instrumentation. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography were performed using a Polygram SilG/UV254 (TLC plates) and silica gel MN 60 (70–230 mesh) by Macherey-Nagel. 1H (250.1 MHz) and 13C (62.9 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AC-F 250 spectrometer. ESI mass spectra were taken on a Thermo Finnigan AQA LC/MS: −4 kV spray voltage; −10 V capillary voltage; 180 °C capillary temperature; nitrogen as nebulizing gas. The samples were dissolved in methanol containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid. Exact mass determination was provided by the Washington University Mass Spectrometry Resource at the Washington University Center for Biomedical and Bioorganic Mass Spectrometry. A matrix of 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol was employed for the measurements. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR model 1720X. The UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 16 spectrophotometer. The emission spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer LS 55 spectrofluorimeter.

Linear gradient elution: 100% A for 15 min → 75% A (within 35 min). Flow = 1 ml min−1. In the mentioned HPLC conditions, compound 1 is eluted at 16 min (Fig. S1†).3-{2-[2-(2-Hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy}-4-methoxybenzaldehyde 2.

The working electrode was a Pt sphere (area 0.13 cm2), the reference electrode was a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and the auxiliary electrode was a Pt wire. The support electrolyte was 0.1 M (C4H9)4NClO4 (Fluka, puriss. crystallized from CH2Cl2 and vacuum dried) in CH2Cl2 (Merck, Uvasol, distilled over P2O5 and stored under Ar pressure); before use, the solution was stored for 24 hours over 3 Å molecular sieves (Merck, activated for 4 hours at 380 °C).Photovoltaic devicesThe photoactive layers were spun at 2000–3000 rpm from chloroform or chlorobenzene solutions (15 g l−1) onto indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrates previously coated with a layer of polystyrene sulfonic acid doped poly(ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT∶PSS, from Bayer AG). The film thicknesses (around 100 nm) were determined using a profilometer Alpha Step 200 (Tencor Instruments). The structure of the photovoltaic devices was completed by subliming an aluminium top electrode in vacuo, the active area of the devices was 3.14 mm2. Except for the cathode deposition, each step of the device fabrication was performed in ambient conditions. The electrical characterization of the devices was performed with a Keithley 2400 source measure unit, under a dynamic vacuum of 2 × 10−4 mbar, in a home made chamber. Junctions were illuminated through the ITO side with a 300 W Xe arc lamp. The intensity of the incident light (86 mW cm−2) was measured with an Oriel thermopile. No correction was made for light reflection. The optical bench was equipped with a water filter to cut off IR radiation.3. Results and discussionThe synthesis of the macrocyclic methanofullerene 1 is illustrated in Scheme 1. It began with compound 2, which was prepared in 89% yield through a Williamson reaction between 3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde and 2-[2-(2-methoxy)ethoxy]ethyl-p-toluenesulfonate in the presence of K2CO3. Treatment of 2 with tert-butyldimethylsilylchloride (TBDMSCl) and imidazole in CH2Cl2 afforded the protected alcohol-aldehyde 3 in 82% yield. This was used for the Wittig coupling reaction with bis(phosphonium chloride) 4, followed by isomerization of the crude mixture with iodine in refluxing toluene to afford the trans-trans bis(styryl)benzene 5. The configuration of the double bonds in 5 was established via NMR spectroscopy, through the measurement of the 3JHH of the olefin protons which was found to be around 16 Hz, in line with literature data for olefin trans protons.31 Removal of the TBDMS groups from 5 with tetrabutylammonium fluoride gave deprotected bis(alcohol) 6 in 33% overall yield calculated from 3. Scheme 1  Synthesis of fullerene–bis(styryl)benzene dyad 1: (a) 2-[2-(2-methoxy)ethoxy]ethyl-p-toluenesulfonate, K2CO3, acetone, reflux, 12 h, 89%; (b) TBDMSCl, imidazole, CH2Cl2, 25 °C, 5 h, 82%; (c) 2,5-methoxy-1,4-methyltriphenylphosphonium chloride 4, EtOH, t-BuOLi, 25 °C, 5 h; (d) Bu4NF, THF, 25 °C, 4 h, 33% calculated from 3; (e) malonyl dichloride, NaHCO3, CH2Cl2, 1 h, 36%; (f) C60, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, I2, toluene, 25 °C, 3 h, 42%. Compound 6, in the presence of malonyl dichloride and sodium bicarbonate in CH2Cl2, afforded the product of macrocyclization 7 in 36% isolated yield. Functionalization of C60 with the cyclic bis(styryl)benzene-malonate derivative 7 was based on the nucleophilic Bingel cyclopropanation of the fullerenes.32 The reaction of C60 and 7 in the presence of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene and I2 in toluene at room temperature afforded methanofullerene 1 in 42% isolated yield. The presence of the oxyethylene groups confers to compound 1 a good solubility in some organic solvents, such as CHCl3, tetrahydrofuran, chlorobenzene or toluene. HPLC analysis was employed to assess the purity of derivative 1 (Fig. S1†) whereas NMR spectroscopy and exact mass determination were used to validate its proposed molecular structure (Fig. S2–S3†). The symmetry of compound 1 is indicated by its NMR spectra. The 13C spectrum shows 28 signals (12 signals are attributed to the bis(styryl)benzene moiety and 16 to the fullerene sphere) between δ 165 and 105, as well as 9 signals in the aliphatic region. The two sp3 fullerene carbons resonate at δ 71.2, together with the adjacent spiro carbon at δ 52.4. The structure of 1 is confirmed by HR-FAB mass spectrometry with the molecular ion peak at m/z = 1485.2966 (theoretical mass: m/z = 1485.3123).The geometry of the fullerene dyad 1 was optimized using an ONIOM multilayer model, as implemented in the GAUSSIAN 03 program package.33 The structure of 1 was partitioned into two layers. The bis(styryl)benzene moiety was treated at the DFT level of theory, using the Becke three-parameter Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP) exchange correlation potential, through which electron correlation effects are included, with a 3-21G* basis set. The methanofullerene with the oxyethylene chains was considered as the outer layer and described by a computationally less demanding, semi-empirical method (AM1). The mentioned calculations showed that the bis(styryl)benzene moiety in 1 retains its planar and conjugated molecular structure, with no major distortions induced by the macrocyclic structure (Fig. 1). As a consequence, no meaningful perturbation of its electronic properties is expected because of the covalent linkage to the acceptor moiety. Fig. 1  (a) ONIOM(B3LYP/3-21G*:AM1) optimized geometry of fullerene dyad 1 (high level represented in ball and stick style; low level AM1 in tube style. (b) Top view (space-filling) of the fullerene dyad 1 represented in (a). It is interesting to note that molecular modelling studies on dyad 1 revealed that, in its lowest-energy conformation, the bis(styryl)benzene moiety does not stay above but lies on a side of the fullerene sphere, in a minimum energy conformation that brings the two chromophores in close proximity [Fig. 1(b)]. However, both 1H and 13C the NMR spectra of 1 are consistent with a C2v symmetrical structure, thus suggesting that the bis(styryl)benzene moves back and forth at room temperature from one side of the fullerene to the other. This phenomenon has been already documented for a porphyrin–methanofullerene dyad.28The absorption spectrum of dyad 1 in dichloromethane (Fig. 2) is the superposition of the absorption features of the bis(styryl)benzene and fullerene chromophores, indicating a negligible interaction between the two components in the ground state. This is in agreement with the voltammetric results (vide infra). Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of the macrocyclic dyad 1 and of the bis(styryl)benzene precursor 7 in CH2Cl2. The spectrum of a 100 nm thick film of 1, onto glass/ITO substrate, is also shown (F) for comparison. Emission measurements with dyad 1 and model 7 were carried out in CH2Cl2 at 25 °C. Excitation of 7 (λexc = 400 nm) produces a strong emission band with a maximum at around 445 nm (Fig. 3). A solution of dyad 1, with equal absorbance at λexc = 400 nm, shows a remarkable quenching of the previously mentioned 445 nm emission. Fig. 3  Fluorescence spectra of the macrocyclic dyad 1 and of the bis(styryl)benzene precursor 7 in CH2Cl2 at 25 °C. The voltammogram of 1 (Fig. 4) shows three reduction waves at negative potentials (marked with 1 to 3 in Fig. 4), that are due to the methanofullerene moiety, and two oxidation waves (4 and 5) in the region of positive potentials. Fig. 4  Cyclic voltammograms at 20 mV s−1 of 1 (dashed line) and 7 (full line) 0.5 nM in CH2Cl2–(C4H9)4 N ClO4 0.1 M. The voltammogram of 7 does not show reduction waves up to the electrolyte breakdown at negative potentials but it shows two oxidation waves, close to those observed for dyad 1, in the region of positive potentials. The voltammetric waves 1 and 4 appear reversible, in fact the differences between the maximum potential of the oxidation waves [Eo(i), where i is the marker of the wave, in this case i = 1 and i = 4] and the minimum potential of the related reduction waves [Er(i), in this case Er(1) and Er(4)] are very close to 59 mV. Waves 2 and 3 appear quasi-reversible, likely because of follow-up reactions associated to electrochemically-induced opening of the cyclopropane ring, as typically observed in malonate-fullerenes.34Table 1 summarizes the redox potentials E½(i) = [Eo(i) −
				Er(i)]/2 that are in reasonable agreement with the values recorded at 0.1 V s−1 for pristine fullerene in the same electrolyte,35 if the small influence of the derivatization of 1 on the redox potentials of the methanofullerene moiety is taken into account.36 In fact, the functionalization of fullerene, leading to methanofullerene C61H2, introduces a potential shift estimated at 120 mV, but larger potentials shift are expected if stronger electron donors are attached.37 Furthermore, within the experimental uncertainty, E½(4) and E½(5) of 1 are equal to those of 7, confirming that electronic interactions between methanofullerene and bis(styryl)benzene moieties are negligible, as already reported for oligophenylenevinylene–fulleropyrrolidine dyads.19b,19f

The surface morphology of films of dyad 1, spun onto ITO/PEDOT∶PSS substrates from chloroform or chlorobenzene solutions, was investigated by means of scanning force microscopy and the images (not shown here) revealed a fairly smooth surface, as already observed for films of other fullerene dyads.23Photovoltaic cells were realized, using the ITO/PEDOT∶PSS/1/Al configuration, to test the photoresponse of the dyad. The devices were prepared at ambient conditions, apart from the cathode deposition, and tested in dynamic vacuum (2 × 10−4 mbar). Junctions with good rectification properties were obtained. A typical current–voltage curve in the dark is reported in Fig. 5(a). Under white-light irradiation of intensity 86 mW cm−2 they gave current–voltage curves as shown in Fig. 5(b), with a short-circuit current (jsc) of 9.3 × 10−5 A cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.68 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.30. The values for Voc and FF are respectively the highest and among the highest reported for OPV–fullerene dyads. The overall white-light conversion efficiency (η) calculated for the devices was 0.022%. This is, to our knowledge, the highest value reported in the literature, for cells based on dyads which contain a fullerene tethered to an oligo(phenylene)vinylene, obtained under high level irradiation conditions (not lower than 80 mW cm−2). Solar cells whose active layer was spun from chlorobenzene exhibited the same performance of those spun from chloroform.

Photovoltaic parameters: jsc = 9.3 × 10−5 A cm−2; Voc = 0.68 V; FF = 0.30; η = 0.022%. The active layer was spun from CHCl3. Room temperature. ConclusionIn summary, we have found that a macrocyclic bis(styryl)benzene-linked fullerene works as an active component in solar cells. The photovoltaic power conversion efficiency, far from being attractive to the market, represents nevertheless the highest value reported at solar irradiation levels for cells based on dyads in which a fullerene is tethered to a phenylenevinylene structure. In particular, the limited conformational freedom between the fullerene and bis(styryl)benzene units in 1, if compared to other reported oligo(phenylene)vinylene–fullerene dyads, could play a favourable role in the transport properties of the solar cell. It is worth underlining that the intrinsic fullerene/bis(styryl)benzene moiety weight ratio of 1.8 in dyad 1 is significantly lower than the optimized fullerene/polymer weight ratio of 4, presently used in the most efficient MDMO-PPV/fullerene derivative solar cells.6 This might be a factor limiting the intrinsic efficiency of devices based on dyad 1 compared to that of the corresponding fullerene–PPVs blends, although a competition between energy transfer and electron transfer cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, because of the limited length of the bis(styryl)benzene structure, the absorption spectrum of 1 (Fig. 2) does not cover the wavelength range of the corresponding polymer, leading to a lower photon collection and hence to a lower overall power conversion efficiency. Further improvement could be expected by the utilization of new fullerene derivatives with a wider absorption spectrum in the visible range.AcknowledgementsFunding from MIUR (GR/No. PRIN2004035502, RBAU017S8R, RBNE01P4JF) and from ITM-CNR is gratefully acknowledged.
