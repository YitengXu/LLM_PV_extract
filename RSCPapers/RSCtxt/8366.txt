    , Accepted 21st June 2018First published on 21st June 2018AbstractHybrid inorganic–organic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention in the recent years due to their excellent photoelectric properties. However, the fast degradation of perovskite solar cells under humid environment restricts their industrial applications. Herein, we discovered that the hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite films remain undecomposed in water after adding 2-aminoethanethiol hydrochloride (2-AET·HCl) as S in 2-AET·HCl can fix the methylamine vacancies and coordinate with Pb in the material, thus protecting the perovskite film from water. The optimal Cs0.15MA0.85PbI3·(0.578)2-AET perovskite film generates a device with a fill factor of 0.68, yielding a power convention efficiency (PCE) of 1.1% after immersion in water. This is the first time where PSCs with high water resistance have been realized without inserting hydrophobic layers, which provides a new approach to enhance the capability of water resistance for PSCs.

Design, System, Application
The sensitivity of perovskite materials to water poses a huge challenge for their commercialization and industrialization. The organic components in the molecular structures of perovskites govern their extreme sensitivity. Based on the above-mentioned considerations, we introduced 2-aminoethanethiol hydrochloride (2-AET·HCl) into perovskite precursor solutions. The interaction between the additive and perovskite could enhance the stability of perovskite molecules against water, avoiding the invading of water molecules. Due to this molecular design in perovskite precursor compounds, the humidity-resistance of perovskite photovoltaic devices improved remarkably. This finding can help us achieve long-time stable perovskite solar cells for practical applications.

Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention from both the science and business communities as their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has increased from 3.8% in 2009 to a current world record of 22.7%.1–7 Perovskite materials in PSCs constitute materials having stoichiometry of AMX3 to form a three-dimensional (3-D) network of corner-sharing MX6 4-octahedra, where A is a cation located at the interstices of the 12-fold cuboctahedra coordination (usually CH3NH2 (MA), NH2CHNH (FA), Cs or their combination), M is a bivalent metal (Pb or Sn), and X is an anion (halide Cl, Br or I). Such hybrid organic–inorganic compositions generally integrate properties that are normally not achievable with either organic or inorganic materials alone. Although the performance of PSCs has rapidly enhanced within a few years, the stability issue has not been fully resolved, which restricts their industrial applications. To date, many studies have reported various approaches to enhance the stability of PSCs8 such as adding dewatering interlayers, modifying charge transport layers,9,10 introducing encapsulation techniques,11–13 and grain boundary engineering,14 but the obstacle of finding suitable perovskite materials still remains. Recently reported studies for regulating perovskite materials such as composition control,15 dimensional tailoring,16,17 and coordination engineering18,19 have greatly improved the stability up to ten-thousand hours under ambient conditions.20 However, the decomposition of perovskite materials in water due to their organic components still impedes the application of PSCs in real environments. Thus, it is vital to construct water-stable perovskite films as well as devices to obtain outdoor applications.
Herein, we introduced 2-aminoethanethiol hydrochloride (2-AET·HCl) into the perovskite precursor solutions to eradicate the inherent methylamine vacancies, thereby enhancing the water resistance of perovskite films. Besides, we found that Cl− and cesium can effectively reduce crystal defects and improve crystallization. In this study, we used Cs0.15MA0.85PbI3·(0.578)2-AET as the light absorbing layer and obtained PSCs exhibiting remarkable water resistance with PCEs up to 1.1%, yielding a current density of 2.39 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 0.68.
Results and discussion
First, we conducted a water resistance test by dropping water on the perovskite films prepared from precursors with or without the 2-AET·HCl additive for comparison (Fig. 1a). The pristine control perovskite film displayed a color change from MAPbI3 black phase to yellow PbI2 phase instantly, whereas our modified perovskite film with 2-AET·HCl additive remained black. This enhancement is due to the incorporation of 2-AET·HCl; the 2-AET part of the molecule removes the methylamine vacancies, and the HCl part coordinates with Pb2+ to improve the crystal quality.

X equals to 0.00, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.30. 
As a number of studies have shown that doping of Cs in MAPbI3 perovskite films can enhance their stability,21,22 we further studied CsxMA(1−x)PbI3 films under the influence of the 2-AET·HCl additive. The XRD patterns in Fig. 1c clearly present shifted peaks with varying Cs contents, which confirms the doping of Cs in the perovskite films. Moreover, these shifted peaks resulting from Cs doping counteract the negative imposition of 2-AET·HCl and maintain the integrity of perovskite crystals.21,23 We also investigated the stability of films generated with the 2-AET·HCl additive before (Fig. S3a†) and after (Fig. 1d and S3b†) water immersion using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. Unaltered UV-vis spectra confirmed the water resistance of these Cs-doped films.
Furthermore, we soaked the modified perovskite films in water and investigated the phase evolution of perovskite films after immersing in water with varying times (Fig. 2a). All the perovskite films before and after water immersion exhibited the same typical perovskite peaks. However, an increase in water immersion time led to dramatic reduction in the intensity of perovskite peaks, suggesting degradation of perovskite crystallinity and excellent water-resistance property of these films. To elaborate the mechanism of 2-AET·HCl in enhancing the moisture resistance of such perovskite materials, Fig. 2 presents modulated illustrations of the effect of 2-AET·HCl on perovskite films. It has been widely recognized in the literature that methylamine vacancies exist in perovskite molecules on account of point defects (Fig. 2c).24,25 According to the coordination engineering theory, water molecules destroy perovskite structures by entering into the methylamine vacancies more often than replacing the methylammonium ions (Fig. 2d). As we introduced 2-amioethanethiol hydrochloride, its sulfhydryl (–SH) groups filled the methylamine vacancies and formed strong bonds with Pb2+ ions. Sufficient –SH elements eliminated methylamine vacancies and replaced some of the methylamines (Fig. 2e). Hence, water molecules were restricted from invading the perovskites.

To further optimize perovskite film preparation, we studied the effect of the molecular ratio of 2-AET·HCl and methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) on the film quality. We observed the absence of perovskite crystals on the film with 1:1 molecular ratio of 2-AET·HCl to MAPbI3 (Fig. 3b) due to the excess 2-AET·HCl hindering the crystal growth of perovskite. Hence, we investigated different fabrication procedures for achieving high-quality perovskite films using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 3a–e). We found that an annealing temperature of 150 °C was required for the formation of completely crystallized films, and the annealing time at 150 °C is critical for smoothness of the films (Fig. 3d). As seen from more blurred grain boundaries (Fig. 3e), we noticed that over-annealing at high temperature even for a short time causes degradation of the films; this was also confirmed by XRD spectrum, as shown in Fig. S5.† Therefore, the optimal condition was found at 65 °C for 2 min, 100 °C for 5 min and 150 °C for 2 min.

We tested the photovoltaic performance of devices with Cs0.15MA0.85PbI3·(0.578)2-AET as the light absorbing layer with the structure of FTO/compact blocking layer TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/HTM/Au, as shown in the schematic and SEM images (Fig. 4a and b). Remarkably, the device worked in an identical manner before (Fig. 4c) and during immersion in water (Fig. 4d), generating voltages of 0.815 V and 0.793 V, respectively, thus demonstrating exceptional stability in water. For further confirming the charge-transfer kinetics, we observed clear lifetime quenching of perovskite films with electron transport layer (ETL) or hole transport layer (HTL) using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (Fig. 4e), which indicated effective carrier transfer within the device. Hence, we assessed the performance of such devices after soaking in water and obtained a PCE of 1.1% with current density of 2.39 mA cm−2 compared with PCE of 0.45% for the device without Cs (Fig. 4f). This provides a new perspective to enhance the stability of perovskite devices in water. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to have successfully constructed working perovskite devices demonstrating no effect from water immersion.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we report that introduction of 2-aminoethanethiol hydrochloride into perovskite precursor solutions promotes the water-resistance ability of perovskite devices without compromising their inherent crystallinity and optoelectronic properties. We have shown that these perovskite films can be successfully maintained in a stable condition in water without any degradation. Further optimizations in film morphology and charge carrier transfer also contribute to enhanced photovoltaic performance. Herein, for the first time, we synthesized working perovskite devices that can work after immersing in water with PCE up to 1.1%, yielding a current density of 2.39 mA cm−2 and voltage of 0.68 eV. This study presents a new strategy to enhance the water resistance of perovskite films, thereby improving the stability of PSCs while retaining the device intact.
