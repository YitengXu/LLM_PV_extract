    , Accepted 30th June 2017First published on 30th June 2017AbstractPhoton upconversion (UC) is an attractive strategy to substantially enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells via upconverting unavailable near-infrared sunlight to available visible light. However, to date, it is almost infeasible to achieve effective PCE improvement of solar cells with the assistance of UC materials, limited by their poor UC efficiency and extremely weak and narrowband near-infrared absorption. Here, we demonstrate the efficient photon energy UC in semiconductor plasmon mCu2−xS@SiO2@Er2O3 (mCSE) nanocomposites, where the broadband semiconductor plasmon (800–1600 nm) of mCu2−xS serves as an antenna to sensitize UC of Er2O3 nanoparticles. The overall upconversion luminescence (UCL) of the composites was dramatically enhanced by a factor of ∼1000, with a maximal inner quantum efficiency of 14.3%. The excitation range was expanded, ranging from 800 to 1600 nm. As a proof-of-concept, the highly efficient mCSE nanocomposites were utilized to improve the PCE of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The expansion of the near-infrared response (800–1000 nm) and considerable improvement of the PCE were obtained, with an optimum PCE of 17.8%. The mCSE composites in PSCs enhanced the photocurrent via electron transfer from oxygen defects to the conduction band of TiO2 under irradiation of one sunlight. Under irradiation of 15 suns, the electron transfer and reabsorption of UCL both contributed to the enhancement of PCE. Our work can provide an insightful thought on boosting UC efficiency as well as broadening the PCE of PSCs.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the fastest-advancing solar technology to date,1 have become commercially attractive due to their low cost,2,3 simple fabrication,4–6 and high efficiency.7–9 However, PSCs are usually unable to utilize light (800–1700 nm) beyond the visible region limited by their intrinsic band gap, which accounts for ∼55% of the total solar energy.10–12 Consequently, photon energy upconversion has been thought to be a promising way to harvest of this portion of sunlight and transform it into available visible light. However the most well-known upconversion materials13–15 (e.g., bulk β-NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ with the UC efficiency of ∼3%) have been used to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of other types of solar cells11,16–19 (e.g., dye-sensitized solar cells and quantum dot sensitized cells). Nevertheless, the improvements of the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solar cells based on upconverters are extremely low and merely serve as a proof of principle, restricted by the lower UC efficiency, the smaller absorption cross section and narrower excitation band of 4f–4f transitions for upconverters.20 Therefore, to enhance the near-infrared response of PSCs, designing and obtaining a new class of upconverters with high efficiency as well as broadband absorption of near-infrared light is of high importance.
Some lanthanide oxides (e.g., Yb2O3 and Er2O3) demonstrate efficient UC broadband emissions with an estimated UC efficiency of as high as ∼10% under the excitation of a 980 nm laser diode.21–23 More interestingly, differing from the well-known fluoride phosphors encountering concentration quenching and temperature quenching, lanthanide oxides even have better performance at high doping concentration and elevated temperature.24–26 However, the efficient upconversion luminescence (UCL) of lanthanide oxides is always obtained under laser irradiation with higher power density, which is both much larger than the power density of sunlight and narrower than the spectral range of sunlight. Noticeably, Cu2−xS, a kind of heavily doped semiconductor material, displays an intense localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption band at near-infrared wavelengths, arising from collective oscillations of excess free carriers associated with constitutional vacancies in the lattice.27–29 It is expected that plasmon Cu2−xS nanoparticles could be explored as an antenna to sensitize the UCL of lanthanide oxides, degrading the threshold power as well as expanding the spectral absorption range of lanthanide oxides.
In this work, we fabricated mCu2−xS@SiO2@Er2O3 (mCSE) nanocomposites, which displayed an efficient broadband emission in the visible region with an optimum UC efficiency of 14.3% under 980 nm excitation, enabling UC within 800–1600 nm excitation. Moreover, the mCSE nanocomposites were successfully applied to improve the PCE (∼10% enhancement) of PSCs.
Results
Structure and optical properties of mCSE nanocomposites

Scheme 1 shows the fabrication process of mCu2−xS@SiO2@Er2O3 nanocomposites and the structure of mCu2−xS@SiO2@Er2O3-based PSCs. First, spherical Cu2−xS nanoparticles were synthesized through a hot-injection method,27 which were mono-dispersed and homogeneous, with an average size of ∼6.5 nm (Fig. 1a). Cu2−xS nanoparticles were further capsulated in a SiO2 nanosphere via a modified Stober method,30,31 forming mCu2−xS@SiO2 with a diameter of ∼45 nm (Fig. 1b). Then, the mCu2−xS@SiO2@Er(OH)CO3 composites were prepared by a urea coprecipitation method.26 After being annealed at 400–700 °C for 2 hours, the mCu2−xS@SiO2@Er2O3 nanocomposites were finally fabricated with a 7 nm Er2O3 shell.

(h) Extinction spectra of Cu2−xS and mCSE nanocomposites annealed at different temperatures. 
To fabricate mCu2−xS@SiO2@Er(OH)CO3 composite sensitized PSCs, the mCu2−xS@SiO2@Er(OH)CO3 composites were mixed with mesoporous TiO2 and then annealed at 500 °C for half an hour. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of mCSE nanoparticles (Fig. 1c and d) show that the Cu2−xS particles are distributed in a SiO2 sphere and an Er2O3 shell could be clearly distinguished. Meanwhile, the energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) spectrum of mCSE nanocomposites (Fig. S1†) demonstrates that the mCSE nanocomposites are indeed formed.
The elemental analysis of EDX mapping was further employed to identify the internal structure of the mCSE sample annealed at 500 °C (Fig. 1e). It shows that all of the elements (copper, sulphur, silicon, and erbium elements) are distributed homogeneously in the sphere and a core–shell structure is formed (d(Er) > d(Si) > d(S, Cu)). From the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) of the mCSE nanocomposites (Fig. 1f), two different fringe spacings are determined, ∼0.307 nm and ∼0.196 nm, which correspond with the spacing of the (2,2,2) plane of cubic Er2O3 (0.307 nm) (JCPDS no. 77-0464) and the (0,1,20) plane of rhombohedral Cu2−xS (0.196 nm) (JCPDS no. 47-1748), respectively. The XRD patterns of Cu2−xS and mCSE nanocomposites annealed at different temperatures ranging from 400 to 700 °C were further recorded (Fig. 1g). The peaks of pure Cu2−xS nanoparticles are indexed to the (0,0,15), (1,0,10), (0,1,20), and (1,1,15) planes of rhombohedral Cu2−xS (digenite) with the space group Rm (JCPDS no. 47-1748), respectively. The peaks of Cu2−xS and Er2O3 can be identified in the patterns of mCu2−xS@SiO2@Er2O3 nanocomposites annealed at 400 and 500 °C. While for samples annealed at 600 and 700 °C, the peaks of Cu2−xS are quite weak and only the peak of (0,1,20) plane could be identified. At high annealing temperatures a part of the Cu2−xS particles were oxidized to CuO, which is verified by the distinguished peaks of CuO in the pattern of the sample annealed at 700 °C. Note that no peaks of SiO2 are observed in the XRD patterns owing to its amorphous phase. Based on the above, mCSE nanocomposites were successfully fabricated.
The UV-Vis-Infrared absorption spectra (Fig. 1h) of Cu2−xS and mCSE nanocomposites annealed at different temperatures ranging from 400 to 700 °C were recorded. In pure Cu2−xS nanoparticles, a surface plasmon absorption band centered at ∼1200 nm can be confirmed. Differing from the free electron induced localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of novel metal nanoparticles, the LSPR of Cu2−xS nanoparticles stems from the Cu defect induced charge carriers. Based on the modified Mie–Drude theory by Luther et al.,28 the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption frequency ωsp depends on the density of charge carriers (Nh), which can be expressed as  where εm is the dielectric constant of the environmental medium, e is the elemental charge, ε0 is the free space permittivity, mh is the hole effective mass, approximated to be 0.8m0, where m0 is the electron mass, γ is the full-width at half maximum of the LSPR related absorption peak. The density of charge carriers (Nh) was estimated to be 3.5 × 1021 cm−3. In the annealed mCSE nanocomposites, the LSPR absorption decreases, broadens and shifts to the red with increasing the annealing temperature, which can be attributed to the gradual oxidation of Cu2−xS nanoparticles.32 When the annealing temperature is above 600 °C, the LSPR absorption becomes very weak and disappears, suggesting that most of the Cu2−xS particles are oxidized and even transformed into CuO, which can be confirmed by the XRD patterns (Fig. 1g). No obvious peak is observed in the extinction spectrum of Er2O3 NPs (Fig. 1h). The extinction decrease of Er2O3 nanoparticles with the increase of wavelength should be attributed to the scattering of the Er2O3 nanoparticles.
UCL of mCSE nanocomposites
The UCL of all the mCSE and SiO2@Er2O3 composites (Fig. 2a and S2†) is power-dependent. For the typical mCSE composites (annealed at 500 °C), the green 2H11/2/4S3/2–4I9/2 and red 4F9/2–4I15/2 inner-shell transitions of Er3+ can be clearly distinguished in a lower excitation power range. Owing to the strong cross relaxation of 4F7/2 + 4I11/2–4F9/2 for Er3+ ions, the red emissions are dominant (Fig. 2b). As the excitation power is high enough (beyond ∼0.21 W mm−2), the narrow-line emissions disappear completely and bright white broadband emissions centering around ∼650 nm appear and dramatically increase with excitation power, which can be attributed to the efficient charge transfer from 4F9/2 of Er3+ to oxygen defect states through the tunneling effect. Electrons in oxygen vacancy states further recombine with holes in the valence band of Er2O3, generating broadband emissions.24,26 The generation of holes can be confirmed by the occurrence of photocurrent accompanying the broadband emissions in SiO2@Er2O3 and mCSE composites (Fig. S3a†). In contrast to the SiO2@Er2O3 with the same size, the threshold power densities for generating broadband emissions in mCSE nanocomposites decrease, depending on the annealing temperature of the samples. The sample annealed at 500 °C has the lowest threshold power density of ∼90 mW mm−2, which decreases ∼6 times than that of SiO2@Er2O3 nanocomposites (Fig. 2c). It also demonstrates the strongest broadband emission intensity illuminated at the same excitation power density of ∼1.23 W mm−2 (Fig. 2d).

The incident light wavelengths are 808 nm, 980 nm, 1540 nm and 650 nm, respectively. The  represents the averaged electric field enhancement factor. 

Fig. 2e shows the power density dependence of the integral UCL intensity of SiO2@Er2O3 and mCSE nanocomposites on the excitation power density of 980 nm light in logarithmic coordinates. In general, UCL intensity (IUC) increases with increasing excitation power (P) with a power law of IUC ∼ Pn, where n represents the number of pumping photons required to excite rare earth ions from the ground state.33,34 For SiO2@Er2O3 nanocomposites (independent of annealing temperature), the power-density dependence of intensity can be divided into three periods. In the first period, before the generation of UC broadband emission, the slope is ∼1.26. In the second period, accompanying by the generation of UC broadband emission, the intensity increases dramatically with a slope of ∼10.5. This super-large slope suggests the occurrence of a photon avalanche or thermal avalanche.35,36 In the third period, the slope n drops to ∼1.97 again. The power-density dependence of UCL intensity for the mCSE composites is similar to that for SiO2@Er2O3, except that the first period is not obvious. This is because the threshold power density for the broadband emission of mCSE is too low. Fig. 2f shows the enhancement factor (EF), which is defined as the ratio of UCL intensity of the mCSE composites to that of SiO2@Er2O3 composites as a function of excitation power density. With the increase of excitation power, the EFs first quickly increase and approach an optimum at the power density of ∼0.87 W mm−2 and then drastically decrease for all the annealed samples. The mCSE sample annealed at 500 °C has the largest EFs (around 1100 times under the excitation power density of 800 mW mm−2), which is consistent with the results of Fig. 2b and c. This can be attributed to the stronger LSPR of mCu2−xS nanoparticles and better crystallinity of the samples annealed at 500 °C. Note that the UC intensity fluctuation for the mCSE nanocomposites is within ±4% under 980 nm continuous illumination for 160 min (∼1.23 W mm−2), which implies their high stability (Fig. S4†).
In SiO2@Er2O3 and mCSE composites (annealed at 500 °C), the power-density-dependent inner quantum efficiency for the UCL of Er3+ is recorded under 980 nm excitation (Fig. 2g). Naturally, it gradually increases with increasing power density, from 0.1% to 6% for SiO2@Er2O3 and from 0.3% to 14.3% for mCSE in the range of 0.09–1.47 W mm−2. Besides upconversion induced by blackbody radiation,22 the inner quantum efficiency of ∼14.3% in mCSE composites is almost the most efficient reported until now. Moreover, the absolute brightness of the sample was determined to be as high as 7778 cd m−2 under the power density of 1.23 W mm−2. The inner quantum efficiency of mCSE composites increases ∼2 fold compared to that of the SiO2@Er2O3 composites, which can be attributed to the coupling of Er2O3 emissions with plasmon Cu2−xS nanoparticles and the increased temperature induced by extra photothermal effects in mCSE composites (Fig. S3b†). In the light of our previous result,26 the UCL intensity increases with the increase of temperature in the studied temperature range (<200 °C). The excitation spectra of mCSE and SiO2@Er2O3 composites are compared (Fig. 2h). In the SiO2@Er2O3 composites, two sharp peaks situated at ∼800 and ∼980 nm can be identified, corresponding to the 4I15/2–4I9/2 and 4I15/2–4I11/2 transitions. It is interesting to observe that in the mCSE composites, the excitation bands are broadened ranging from 800 to 1600 nm. This could be attributed to the amplification of LSPR to the excitation field and the increase of phonon density in the mCSE, which results in the efficient phonon-assisted transitions of Er3+.
In mCSE nanocomposites, on one hand, the LSPR of Cu2−xS nanoparticles can couple with excitation light/emission light, leading to excitation field enhancement or the Purcell effect, and the improvement of the radiative transition rate as well as inner quantum efficiency of UCL. On the other hand, the photo-thermal effect of Cu2−xS nanoparticles should occur, resulting in an increased temperature, which is beneficial to enhance the broadband emission.26,37 To understand the amplification of the excitation/emission field, we simulated the |E|2 surrounding the mCSE composites using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solution (Note 1 in the ESI†), as shown in Fig. 2i. It is clear that the |E|2 of Cu2−xS is concentrated around the mCSE composites with a maximum intensity enhancement of 90 times at the hot spots under the excitation of 980 nm light. When changing the wavelength of excitation light to 808 nm or 1540 nm, the enhancement of |E|2 at the hot spots decreases a little. The enhancement decreases to 12 when changing the wavelength to 650 nm (central emission wavelength), because the 650 nm wavelength is far away from the LSPR central wavelength (1200 nm) of Cu2−xS nanoparticles. The averaged electric field enhancement factors are obtained by calculating the average value of the electric field intensity enhancement in the mesh range, which shows 15.7 times enhancement at the excitation of 980 nm and 2.5 times at the emission wavelength (650 nm). Because the broadband upconversion emission is a two-photon process, the enhancement of UCL induced by the excitation field amplification is calculated to be 220 times (Fig. 2f). In the light of the result of the inner quantum efficiency, the coupling of LSPR with emission light induces about 2-fold UCL enhancement. As the excitation power increases, the temperature in mCSE composites (Fig. S3b†) is about 100–250 K higher than that in SiO2@Er2O3 composites. According to the previous reports,26 the luminescence enhancement induced by temperature variation in mCSE composites is about 2–3 folds. Therefore, the practical UC enhancement is roughly consistent with the theoretical prediction.
Overall, the intense strength, high inner quantum efficiency (14.3%) and broad excitation bands (800–1600 nm) of mCSE composites provide them with the possibility to be an ideal upconverter in the application of PSCs.
Perovskite solar cell with mCSE upconverter

Scheme 1 illustrates the PSC with the mCSE upconverter, consisting of a compact TiO2 layer (∼50 nm), mesoporous TiO2 mixed with 0–10 wt% mCSE and a perovskite layer (∼520 nm), a hole transport layer (∼150 nm) and an Au electrode (∼80 nm) (Fig. 3a). The cross-sectional image (Fig. S5†) indicates that the solar cell is flat and uniform. The PCEs of four groups of PSCs, the traditional PSC, the cell containing SiO2@Er2O3, the cell containing mCu2−xS@SiO2 and the solar cell containing mCSE composites were compared (Fig. 3b and Table S1†). PSCs with different proportions of upconverters in weight were prepared with their efficiencies shown in Table 1. Interestingly, the PSC with the optimized (∼5 wt%) mCSE nanocomposites displays the highest PCE of ∼17.8% (Fig. 3b and Table S1†), which is enhanced by ∼10% compared with that of the solar cell without UC nanocomposites (∼16.2%). The PSC with mCSE composites maintained a PCE of 16.9% after being stored in a glovebox for 500 h (Fig. S6†). The average PCE of PSCs with mCSE composites is 17.1% calculated with fifty PSC devices (Fig. 3c). The Jsc and Voc both increase until the proportion of mCSE nanocomposites increases to 5 wt%. The increase of Jsc can be attributed to the contribution of mCSE composites. The increase of Voc can be mainly induced by increasing charge recombination resistance, which is discussed in Fig. 3i. Beyond 5 wt%, PCEs decrease mainly due to the reduction of the filling factor and photocurrent. Differently, after introducing the SiO2@Er2O3 composites, the PCE decreases to ∼12.6%, accompanying by the reduction of Jsc and Voc. The PSC containing mCu2−xS@SiO2 composites exhibits a PCE of ∼16.3%. The slight increase of the PCE might be ascribed to the LSPR scattering of mCSE composites. The enhancement of PCE induced by the LSPR of mCSE composites was quite little compared to the enhancement induced by noble metal NPs (Au or Ag NPs).38 As the density of free carriers in Cu2−xS NPs is one-order lower than that in noble metals, the intensity of LSPR in Cu2−xS NPs is weaker than that in metal NPs. The introduction of SiO2@Er2O3 composites alone is disadvantageous to the PCE. When the Cu2−xS NPs were absent, the light absorption of Er2O3 was quite weak and the contribution to photocurrent was quite little. In addition, the SiO2@Er2O3 NPs were a poor conductor and decreased the charge mobility (see EIS results in Fig. 3i and Table S3†), resulting in a decreased photocurrent.

To elucidate the mechanism of enhancement of PCE, the UV-Vis-Infrared extinction spectra of the mesoporous TiO2 layer and perovskite layer were recorded (Fig. 3d). The TiO2 layers mixed with mCu2−xS@SiO2 and mCSE composites have an enhanced extinction, especially in the infrared region. The extinction of the TiO2/perovskite layer mixed with mCSE composites enhances 40% in intensity in the near-infrared region compared to that without mCSE composites, while it only enhances 5% in the visible region, indicating that the mCSE composites in the solar cell had little influence on the light harvesting of the perovskite layer. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of PSCs without mCSE composites all demonstrate the generation of photocurrent in the range of ∼370 nm to ∼820 nm (Fig. 3e). Consistent with the extinction spectra (Fig. 3d), the generation of photocurrent in the PSC with mCSE composites extends to ∼1000 nm. This can be attributed to the fact that mCSE composites absorbed the near-infrared light and contributed to the photocurrent. The response of photocurrent in the region from 400 to 800 nm was enhanced as well. This can be attributed to the decreased charge transfer resistance (Fig. 3i) in the presence of mCSE composites. Although the TiO2 layer mixed with mCu2−xS@SiO2 exhibits strong absorption in the near-infrared region (Fig. 3d), it does not effectively contribute to the photocurrent and extend the response region (Fig. 3e), indicating that the response in the range of 800–1000 nm of PSCs does not come from the contribution of LSPR absorption of Cu2−xS directly. Meanwhile, the solar cell containing mCSE composites exhibits response and the photocurrent (Jsc) increases with the 980 nm power density increasing (Fig. 3f and S7†), indicating the contribution of the UC process. The current transient vs. time curves (Fig. S8†) showed that the photocurrent of the PSC with mCSE composites was higher than that of the PSC with mCu2−xS@SiO2 when 980 nm light was on. All these results indicate that the infrared light is absorbed by the UC mCSE composites and further contributes to the enhanced photocurrent and PCEs of the PSC.
Further experiments demonstrate that solar cells with mCSE composites have better performance at the higher power irradiance of simulated sunlight (Fig. 3g). For the sake of comparison, the photo-current of PSCs under 7 suns or 15 suns was normalized to 1 sun. Note that the efficiency of the PSC without composites varies little when increasing the solar irradiance intensity. The irradiance power dependence of the PCEs of the PSCs with mCSE composites indicates that the contribution of mCSE composites to the photocurrent is power dependent, which is consistent with the higher quantum efficiency and more effective electronic transition from the valence band to oxygen defects in mCSE composites at the higher excitation power. The PCE of the best-performing solar cell reached 18.8% at a concentration of 15 suns.
The UC broadband emission of mCSE composites was observed under a concentration of 15 suns using a 900 nm short-pass filter (Fig. 3h), indicating that the infrared light can be effectively harvested by the mCSE composites by the upconversion process. The emission intensity decreases dramatically after mixing them with the TiO2 layer (FTO/TiO2 (mCSE)), which can be attributed to the luminescence quenching by the TiO2 layer. The emission intensity of the mCSE composites decreases further but only a little after the introduction of perovskite (FTO/TiO2 (mCSE)/perovskite), which implies that electrons in the oxygen defects are mainly transferred to TiO2, leading to the enhanced photocurrent of solar cells. Considering that the irradiation might induce thermal effects, the temperature of the PSCs was measured by using a thermocouple (Table S2†). Irradiated by the AM1.5G standard, the temperatures were nearly the same for the PSCs with and without mCSE composites. Under irradiation of a concentration of 15 suns, the temperature of the PSC device with mCSE composites increased from 22 to 31 °C. Such a small variation of temperature should have no influence on the lifespan and light harvesting of the perovskite layer. To evaluate the stability of PSCs continuously working under a concentration of 15 suns, the PCEs of the PSC with/without mCSE composites were measured (Fig. S9†). The PCE of the PSC with mCSE composites decreases by 10% after irradiation by 15 suns for 10 h continuously, while it decreases by 8% for the PSC without mCSE composites. The decreases of PCEs are nearly the same, indicating that the introduction of mCSE composites into PSCs had no effect on the stability and lifespan of PSCs. To ascertain the location of the oxygen defect level of mCSE composites relative to the vacuum level, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) studies were performed (Fig. S10†). The results showed that mCSE composites possess an oxygen defect level near −4.1 eV (Fig. 3j), which matched with the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.2 eV). Electrons on the oxygen defect level should transfer to the conduction band of TiO2, leading to the decrease of UC broadband emission of mCSE composites (Fig. 3h). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Fig. 3i, S11 and Table S3†) demonstrate that the charge transfer resistance (Rco ∼ 17.4 Ω) in the PSC with mCSE composites is much lower than that in the pure PSC (Rco ∼ 49.6 Ω). This suggests that the mobility of electrons in the PSC with mCSE composites was enhanced. The charge recombination resistance (Rrec) in the PSC with mCSE composites increased compared to that of the pure PSC, which resulted in the enhanced Voc in Fig. 3b.

Fig. 3j shows the schematic illustration of the energy transfer process of the PSC with mCSE composites. Under irradiation of one sunlight, as the power density of sunlight is much lower than the power threshold for generating broadband emission of mCSE composites, the mCSE composites absorbed the infrared light and electrons in the ground state of Er3+ were populated to the oxygen defect level and then transferred to the conduction band of TiO2, contributing to the charge mobility and photocurrents. The presence of Cu2−xS NPs can enhance the absorption of sunlight by Er2O3. At a concentration of 15 suns, the mCSE composites displayed a broadband upconversion emission, which was mainly quenched by the TiO2 layer or reabsorbed by the perovskite layer. In other words, a part of electrons in the oxygen defects are directly transferred to the conduction band of TiO2. The other part of electrons are relaxed by the radiative transition process, which can be reabsorbed by the perovskite layer. Above all, the incorporation of mCSE composites provides a promising route to reduce the non-absorption photon loss in PSCs.
Conclusions
A novel kind of photon energy UC material, semiconductor plasmon-sensitized mCSE nanocomposites, was prepared, which could efficiently convert broadband infrared light (800–1600 nm) to visible benefiting from the LSPR of Cu2−xS. The nanocomposites demonstrated three-order UCL enhancement, a considerably decreased threshold power density compared to that of SiO2@Er2O3 and an inner quantum efficiency as high as 14.3% under the excitation of 980 nm light (∼1.5 W mm−2). The mCSE upconverter was then applied in a PSC and led to an expanded response in the range of 800–1000 nm and 10% enhancement of PCE under standard solar irradiation. The PCE of the PSC reached 17.8% after introducing the mCSE composites, which increased with increasing the irradiating power, and approached 18.8% at a concentration of 15 suns. This work displays a highly effective UC material and provides a method of enhancing the utilization of infrared light via the upconversion process in PSCs.
Experimental section
Synthesis of Cu2−xS nanoparticles
The Cu2−xS nanoparticles were synthesized via a typical hot-injection method.27,28 The copper precursor was prepared by mixing CuCl (0.01 mol) with a mixture of 4 mL of oleic acid (OA) and 5 mL of oleylamine (OM) at 130 °C for 30 min. Then the as-prepared copper precursor was cooled to room temperature. Meanwhile, the sulfur precursor was prepared by dissolving sulfur powder (0.01 mol) in 40 mL of octadecene at 200 °C for 30 min. And the sulfur solution was maintained at 180 °C, followed by swift injection of the copper precursor. Before cooling to the room temperature, the resulting solution was maintained at 180 °C for 5–15 min. Cu2−xS nanoparticles in the solution were precipitated by adding excess acetone and collected by centrifugation of the suspension (two times). Finally, the precipitate was redispersed in an organic solvent such as carbon tetrachloride, trichloromethane, or cyclohexane.
Synthesis of mCu2−xS@SiO2@Er2O3 nanocomposites
The as-prepared Cu2−xS nanoparticles (0.2 g), 10 mL cyclohexane, 0.5 mL ammonia, 10 mL Triton X-100, 8 mL hexyl alcohol, 2 mL water, and 0.1 mL TEOS were mixed together and stirred for 24 hours at room temperature. Then, the precipitates were collected and washed three times with alcohol. After that, the precipitates (mCu2−xS@SiO2) were dissolved in deionized water, added into 0.3 g Er(NO3)3 and 2.5 g urea, heated at 90 °C for an hour and cleaned with alcohol three times. Then, the obtained sample was annealed at 500 °C for 2 hours. Finally, the mCu2−xS@SiO2@Er2O3 composites were collected. For comparison, SiO2@Er2O3 NPs were synthesized by a similar method.
Solar cell fabrication
First, FTO glasses were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath containing ethanol for 15 min and treated in a UVO cleaner for 15 min. To make a dense TiO2 blocking layer, the cleaned FTO glasses were coated with 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75% Aldrich) in 1-butanol (Aldrich) solution by a spin-coating method, which was heated at 125 °C for 5 min. FTO glasses with TiO2 precursor solutions were heated at 500 °C for 30 min. On the prepared dense TiO2 blocking layer, the nanocrystalline TiO2 paste mixed with mCu2−xS@SiO2@Er(OH)CO3 composites was prepared and was deposited by spin-coating and the deposited film was annealed at 500 °C for 30 min to produce a mesoporous TiO2 film with mCu2−xS@SiO2@Er2O3 composites. PbI2 was deposited on the surface of the TiO2 layer by vapor deposition. Then the film was immersed in a CH3NH3I solution (10 mg mL−1) to form the (CH3NH3)PbI3 perovskite layer. The hole transport material spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated on the film at 3000 rpm. For the counter electrode, 100 nm-thick Au was deposited on the top of the HTM over layer by thermal evaporation.
Characterization
The morphology of the products was recorded with a Hitachi H-8100IV transmission electron microscope under an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The phase structure and purity of the as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray power diffraction with a Rigaku D/max 2550 X-ray diffractometer, using a monochromatized Cu target radiation source (λ = 1.54 Å). UV/vis-NIR absorption spectra were measured with a Shimadzu UV-3600PC UV/vis-NIR scanning spectrophotometer in the range from 300 to 2000 nm. In the measurements of power-dependent UCL spectra, a continuous 980 nm diode laser was used to pump the samples. A visible photomultiplier (350–850 nm) combined with a double-grating monochromator was used for spectral collection. The photoconduction curves were collected by a source-measurement unit under the illumination of a continuous 980 nm diode laser. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed with an ESCALab220i-XL electron spectrometer from VG Scientific. Monochromatic Al Kα X-rays (hν = 1486.6 eV) were employed for analysis with an incident angle of 30° with respect to surface normal. The quantum efficiency was measured by using an Otsuka Electronics QE-2100 with an additional 980 nm laser.
