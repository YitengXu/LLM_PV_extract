    , Accepted 3rd August 2017First published on 4th August 2017AbstractTo achieve efficient non-fullerene polymer solar cells (NF-PSCs), it is important to design and synthesize donor materials. To investigate the substituent effects of electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms and different alkyl chains (–C8C12 or –C10C14) on the thiophene π bridge, four novel conjugated polymers composed of dicyanodistyrylbenzene (DCB)-based and quinoxaline-based units were synthesized and applied in NF-PSC photovoltaic devices. It was found that the different alkyl side groups had a minimal influence on the molecular energy level but a moderate effect on the absorption coefficient, whereas the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the resulting copolymers could be effectively lowered by introducing highly electronegative fluorine atoms into the quinoxaline moiety. As a result, the NF-PSCs based on the fluorinated quinoxaline-based copolymer exhibited high open-circuit voltages (VOC) of up to 1.043 V, which is the highest value to date for devices based on quinoxaline moiety copolymers. Moreover, fluorination also improved the copolymer carrier mobility and absorption coefficient, leading to enhanced JSC and FF, thus giving rise to higher overall efficiencies. NF-PSCs based on PDCB-DFQ812:ITIC exhibited the best performance, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.37%. Our comparative research indicates that fluorinated quinoxaline-based conjugated polymers are promising donor materials for NF-PSCs.
Introduction
In recent decades, polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure, based on a phase-separated blend of organic electron donor and acceptor moieties, have attracted great attention due to their advantages of lightweight, large-area and flexible devices using a roll-to-roll solution process.1–3 Furthermore, PSCs are also considered to be a promising low-cost and environmentally friendly solar technology.4,5 Fullerene-based PSCs with power conversion efficiencies of over 10% have been achieved.6–11 However, the intrinsic drawbacks of fullerene acceptors, such as high production cost, difficulty in tuning the energy levels, and poor visible-light absorption, make further improvement in the photovoltaic performance challenging.12,13 To surmount these obstacles, non-fullerene small-molecule acceptors (SMAs) have recently emerged as alternatives to fullerene derivatives for further improvement of device performance. Various types of SMAs have been developed, such as those based on indacenodithiophene (IDT)14–21 and perylene diimide (PDI),22–28 to yield many efficient NF-PSCs that possess strong and broad absorption and high electron mobility. The donor polymers also play a critical role in achieving highly efficient NF-PSCs. Unfortunately, only several kinds of conjugated polymers, such as poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione] (PBDB-T), poly[(4,8-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-co-(5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)] (PTFBDT-BZS), poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethyllhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-6,7-difluoro-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)-5,8-di(thiophen-2-yl)quinoxaline] (PBQ-4F), poly[(4,8-bis(5-(tripropylsilyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-co-(5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole)] (J71), poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-4,8-di(thien-2-yl)-6-octyl-2-octyl-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-f]benzotriazole-5,7(6H)-dione] (PTzBI), and poly[4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-thienyl] benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl)] (PTB7-Th), have been reported to match non-fullerene SMAs for efficient NF-PSCs.15,29–32 Thus, the synthesis of well-designed high-efficiency donor materials suitable for high-performance NF-PSCs is still very demanding.
Quinoxaline, which contains two electron-withdrawing imine nitrogen atoms, has been successfully applied as the electron-deficient unit for the synthesis of donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers and exhibits promising photovoltaic performance.29,33–37 Furthermore, the phenyl ring substitution of quinoxaline connected by a single bond between the ortho positions could significantly increase the planarity and facilitate both intermolecular packing and charge transport, which is favorable for PSC applications.38–41 Moreover, analogues substituted with branched alkyl chains,7,42 as well as fluorine atom substitution on the conjugated polymer backbone,43–45 could significantly influence the performance of PSCs. Generally, conjugated polymers with fluorine atom substitution show better performance than their non-fluorinated analogous, because the introduction of highly electronegative fluorine atoms into the polymer backbone downshifted the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level. For PSCs, a lower HOMO level also means a higher VOC because the latter is usually determined by the difference between the HOMO of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor. In a few cases, fluorinated polymers have also been reported to exhibit improved JSC and FF, which was ascribed to higher carrier mobility and better morphology.29,44 Moreover, dicyanodistyrylbenzene (DCB) units have been widely used in optoelectronic devices, because the electron-withdrawing –CN substituents can increase the electron affinity to favor efficient charge transport and also depress the frontier energy levels by pulling electrons out of the π-conjugated backbone.46,47 The synergistic effect of both –F and –CN substituents on depressing the HOMO level has proved to be beneficial for improving the VOC of PSCs.
In this work, we focused on the design of a series of novel copolymers (denoted PDCB-Q812, PDCB-DFQ812, PDCB-Q1014, and PDCB-DFQ1014) based on DCB and quinoxaline units with fluorine or non-fluorine atoms and different alkyl chains on the thiophene π bridge and adopted these copolymers as the donor in NF-PSCs using ITIC as the acceptor. We performed a systematic investigation into the optical, electronic, and electrical properties and the characteristics of PSC devices based on these copolymer blend films. Because of the synergistic effect of fluorine atoms and alkyl chains, PDCB-DFQ812 exhibited a maximum PCE of 8.37% with an enhanced JSC of 13.44 mA cm−2 and a high VOC of 1.033 V in NF-PSCs. This higher efficiency of PDCB-DFQ812 arose from the high VOC of over 1 V due to the deeper HOMO level and the higher carrier mobility owing to the presence of fluorine in the conjugated polymer backbone. To the best of our knowledge, the VOC obtained in this work is the highest for a quinoxaline-based copolymer, indicating that fluorine-substituted quinoxaline-based copolymers are promising donor materials for NF-PSCs.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis
The synthetic routes to the copolymers are shown in Scheme 1. The detailed synthetic procedures are described in the ESI.† Four novel conjugated polymers composed of DCB-based and quinoxaline-based units were synthesized, enabling us to investigate the effect of the electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms and the different alkyl chains (–C8C12 or –C10C14) on the performance of the PSCs. The target conjugated copolymers were obtained from a palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling polycondensation reaction between the DCB monomers and quinoxaline building blocks. The conjugated backbone structures were the same for all of the copolymers, and the influence of the substituents was compared. After precipitation in methanol, the resulting copolymers were purified by Soxhlet extraction by successively using methanol, acetone, and n-hexane as the eluent to remove the low-molecular weight fractions and catalyst residues. Finally, the solids were collected using chlorobenzene as the eluent. The resulting copolymers could be dissolved in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene. The molecular weights of the copolymers were determined by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene using polystyrene as the standard. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) were estimated to be 31.77, 40.90, 20.95, and 37.6 kDa with polydispersity indices (PDI) of 1.60, 1.82, 1.88, and 1.87 for PDCB-Q812, PDCB-DFQ812, PDCB-Q1014, and PDCB-DFQ1014, respectively. When comparing the effect of fluorine atom substituents on device performance, the influence of fluorination is more dominant than that of molecular weight.44,45 Hence, the four copolymers provided a useful platform for comparison of the structure–property relationships upon substituent variation.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes to the copolymers. 
The thermal properties of the copolymers were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. S1, ESI†). The onset decomposition temperatures with 5% weight loss (Td) of the copolymers were 373.8 °C, 384.2 °C, 391.2 °C, and 390.8 °C for PDCB-Q812, PDCB-DFQ812, PDCB-Q1014, and PDCB-DFQ1014, respectively, indicating good thermal stability of the resulting copolymers. No discernible thermal transition was observed by DSC analysis in the scanning range from 30 °C to 300 °C (the heating rate was 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen).
Photophysical properties
The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the copolymers were investigated in chlorobenzene solution and as thin films, and their spectra are shown in Fig. 1. Each copolymer showed two characteristic absorption bands, similar to many D–A conjugated polymers, in which the short-wavelength absorption originated from the π–π* transition of the main-chain chromophore, and the long-wavelength absorption at around 600 nm was caused by the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). From solution to thin film, as expected, PDCB-DFQ812 and PDCB-DFQ1014 exhibited stronger aggregation than PDCB-Q812 and PDCB-Q1014, with a sharp shoulder at about 690 nm due to the effect of the fluorine atoms.45 Such enhanced shoulder absorption in films has been observed for many high-performance PSC materials and generally indicates strong intermolecular packing in the solid state that might enhance its mobility and photovoltaic performance.48 Moreover, the absorption became broader and the ICT peak was slightly red-shifted, due to the enhanced planarization of the copolymer chain and the stronger interchain π-stacking degree in the solid film.49

The extinction coefficients of the copolymers in solution and thin films were measured (Fig. S2, ESI†). In both solution and thin films, PDCB-Q812 showed a higher extinction coefficient than PDCB-Q1014, which was similar to the reported literature.7,11 Furthermore, as thin films, PDCB-DFQ812 and PDCB-DFQ1014 showed higher extinction coefficients than PDCB-Q812 and PDCB-Q1014, respectively. This improvement in extinction coefficient is probably due to the auxochromic effect of the fluorine atoms.
The thermochromism of the copolymers in solution was examined as a function of temperature to estimate the strength of the association of the copolymers when they form aggregates (Fig. S3, ESI†). Significant differences were observed depending on the fluorine atom substitution. The copolymers that contained fluorine atoms, i.e., PDCB-DFQ812 and PDCB-DFQ1014, showed a more obvious temperature-dependent aggregation phenomenon, which indicated that they possessed stronger interchain interactions in solution. However, PDCB-Q812 and PDCB-Q1014 showed much poorer aggregation in solution. It has been reported that fluorine atoms can influence the intermolecular interactions significantly, which is beneficial for absorbing more solar photons, enhancing carrier mobility, and affording optimal film morphology.44,45
Electrochemical properties
To determine the electrochemical properties, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the copolymers were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement, and the results are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2. The CV was carried out in a solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M in acetonitrile), using a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a platinum wire as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. A platinum electrode coated with a thin copolymer film was used as the working electrode. The potential of the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was measured as the standard. It was assumed that the redox potential of Fc/Fc+ has an absolute energy level of −4.8 eV under vacuum. The corresponding HOMO/LUMO levels of the copolymers were −5.48/−3.15, −5.55/−3.19, −5.50/−3.17, and −5.58/−3.21 eV for PDCB-Q812, PDCB-DFQ812, PDCB-Q1014, and PDCB-DFQ1014, respectively. These results indicate that the alteration of the alkyl side chains did not obviously disturb the molecular orbitals. However, the conjugated polymers with fluorine substitution were shown to have deeper HOMO levels than their non-fluorinated analogous. The counteracting electron withdrawing effect on the LUMO is stronger than that on the HOMO, thus the introduction of fluorine atoms to the quinoxaline units had a weak effect on the copolymers' LUMO levels.50,51 Hence, by replacing the remaining two hydrogen atoms on the quinoxaline unit with fluorine atoms, the HOMO energy levels of the resulting copolymers would be decreased32 and the VOC of the devices based on fluorine-substituted copolymers could be enhanced.

Theoretical calculations
To demonstrate the optimal molecular geometry and electronic properties, theoretical calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP level with the 6-31G* basis set.7 All of the alkoxy and alkyl side chains were replaced with methoxy and methyl groups to simplify the calculations, and the trimers were used for the calculations. The optimized molecular geometries of the models and their calculated LUMO and HOMO frontier orbitals are depicted in Fig. 3. The HOMO surfaces of the resulting copolymers were well delocalized along their backbones, whereas their LUMO surfaces were mainly localized on the electron-deficient units. Meanwhile, the non-fluorine-substituted copolymers exhibited a HOMO level of −4.88 eV as deduced from theoretical calculations, whereas the fluorine-substituted copolymers possessed a HOMO level of −4.94 eV, which is 0.06 eV lower. These values showed the same trend in the CV measurements, indicating that introducing fluorine atoms onto the quinoxaline unit could depress the HOMO level of the copolymers.

Photovoltaic properties
BHJ solar cells using the copolymers as the electron donors and [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) or 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene) (ITIC) as the electron acceptor were fabricated in a conventional geometry. Because ITIC exhibits suitable energy levels and a strong absorption coefficient as well as a high electron mobility, it is a promising acceptor material for a non-fullerene solar cell.14 Copolymer:ITIC cells have higher PCEs in the regular device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:ITIC/PFN-Br/Ag. The water- and alcohol-soluble poly[(9,9-bis(3-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] dibromide (PFN-Br) was used as the cathode buffer layer because it can facilitate electron collection via the formation of an interfacial dipole.52,53 To achieve higher photovoltaic performance, the processing conditions were systematically optimized in terms of weight ratio, processing additive concentration, and annealing temperature. Initially, various PDCB-DFQ812:ITIC blend ratios of 1.3:1, 1:1, and 1:1.3 (w/w) were used to fabricate the NF-PSC devices (Table S1, ESI†), and a maximum PCE of 6.01% was obtained with a VOC of 0.993 V, a JSC of 10.90 mA cm−2, and an FF of 57.33%. Various temperatures from 100 °C to 160 °C were used for thermal annealing to further optimize the photovoltaic performance of the PSC devices (Table S2, ESI†). Finally, various additives and additive concentrations were used to optimize the morphology (Table S3, ESI†). Accordingly, the optimal copolymer:ITIC ratio was found to be 1:1 (w/w), and the film thicknesses of the active layers, which were spin-coated from CB solutions with 0.25 vol% of 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) as a processing additive and thermal annealing at 140 °C, were around 100 nm. Fig. 4a shows the current density versus voltage (J–V) curves under illumination at AM 1.5G and 100 mW cm−2, and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 2. The devices based on PDCB-DFQ812 and PDCB-DFQ1014 exhibited VOC values of 1.033 and 1.043 V, respectively, which were higher than those of the devices based on PDCB-Q812 and PDCB-Q1014; this can be ascribed to their down-shifted HOMO levels because of the fluorine substitution. Moreover, the device based on PDCB-DFQ1014 exhibited a PCE of 7.13% with a VOC of 1.043 V, a JSC of 10.89 mA cm−2, and an FF of 62.3%, whereas the device based on PDCB-DFQ812 showed a PCE of 8.37% with a VOC of 1.033 V, a JSC of 13.44 mA cm−2, and an FF of 58.9%. The improved PCE was primarily ascribed to the PDCB-DFQ812 possessing a higher absorption coefficient, meaning that more solar photons could be absorbed to achieve a higher short-circuit current density. For the copolymer:PC71BM cells, however, the PFN-Br could not infiltrate. The devices based on copolymer:PCBM were optimized the same as the copolymer:ITIC system in a regular device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PCBM/Ca/Al (Tables S4 and S5, ESI†), and a better device performance could be obtained from CB:ODCB (volume ratio 1:1) with 0.5% DIO solutions containing copolymer:PCBM (weight ratio 1:2) (Table S6, ESI†). Furthermore, the copolymer:ITIC based solar cells were fabricated with the same device structure used for copolymer:PCBM. The device results show that copolymer:PCBM based devices did not work as well as copolymer:ITIC based devices (Table S7, ESI†).

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the PSCs fabricated under the optimal conditions were measured, and the plots are shown in Fig. 4b. All of the devices exhibited a broad response range from 300 to 800 nm, and the device based on PDCB-DFQ812 showed the highest EQE, indicating that the enhanced absorption coefficients of the copolymers due to the substituent effect played an important role in improving the EQE and the JSC of the devices. Moreover, the integral current densities obtained from the EQE measurements were consistent with the results observed in the J–V measurements.
Charge carrier mobility
The charge-transport properties of copolymers have an important effect on the resulting photovoltaic performance. To investigate the hole/electron mobilities of the copolymer/ITIC blend films, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was used.54 The hole-only and electron-only devices were measured with device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/copolymer:ITIC/MoO3(10 nm)/Al and ITO/ZnO(40 nm)/copolymer:ITIC/Ca(10 nm)/Al, respectively. The mobility was determined by fitting the dark current to the model of a single-carrier SCLC, which is described by the following equation:  where J is the current, μ0 is the carrier mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, d is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the effective voltage. The effective voltage can be obtained by subtracting the built-in voltage (Vbi) and the voltage drop (Vs) from the substrate's series resistance from the applied voltage (Vappl), i.e., V = Vappl − Vbi − Vs. The carrier mobility can be calculated from the slope of the J1/2–V curves (Fig. S4, ESI†), and the related results are summarized in Table 2. The hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of the PDCB-Q812:ITIC blend film were calculated to be 8.58 × 10−4 and 1.93 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, whereas those of the PDCB-DFQ812:ITIC blend film were calculated to be 2.37 × 10−3 and 9.06 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Similar trends were also observed for the blend films of PDCB-Q1014 and PDCB-DFQ1014. The results suggest that fluorination could enhance the charge carrier mobility, which is beneficial for the improvement in device performance. Furthermore, the devices based on –C8C12 alkyl side chains exhibited higher hole and electron mobility than the devices based on –C10C14 alkyl side chains in both the fluorinated and non-fluorinated systems; this may be ascribed to the stronger molecular ordering of copolymers with the –C8C12 alkyl side chain than that of the copolymers with –C10C14 alkyl side chains, which is beneficial for charge transport.55 This may be one reason for the higher JSC and PCE values. However, the FF of the devices based on PDCB-DFQ812 and PDCB-DFQ1014 unexpectedly exhibited the opposite trend. A range of factors, such as the competition between charge extraction and recombination, and active layer thickness, can potentially affect the FF.56 Thus it seems reasonable that the unexpected trend of the FF might be correlated with the aforementioned factors. However, at the moment the reason for the emergence of the opposite trend of the FF of these devices remains unclear.
Charge transfer, extraction, and recombination
Photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments were performed to obtain deeper insight into the exciton dissociation and charge transfer in BHJ films (Fig. S3, ESI†). The quenching of the PL intensities of the PDCB-DFQ812 and PDCB-DFQ1014 blend films was more pronounced than that of the blend films of their non-fluorinated analogues, indicating more efficient charge transfer in the fluorine-substituted copolymer blend films. This result is consistent with the significantly enhanced PCE of the fluorinated copolymer-based devices.
To further investigate the effects of fluorination on the performance of the NF-PSCs, we compared two blend films based on PDCB-Q812:ITIC and PDCB-DFQ812:ITIC obtained under the optimal conditions. First, transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were utilized to probe the effects of fluorine substitution on the charge extraction time during the operation of the solar cell devices. The measurements were carried out at zero bias, with the relevant characteristics shown in Fig. 5a. The charge extraction times were measured to be 0.16 and 0.08 μs for the PDCB-Q812:ITIC and PDCB-DFQ812:ITIC devices, respectively. It is clear that the charge extraction time for the device based on the fluorine-substituted polymer was half that of its non-fluorinated analogs, indicating more efficient charge extraction from the photoactive layer, which is beneficial for enhancing the current density and overall photovoltaic performance. In addition, we studied the bimolecular recombination kinetics of the active layers based on PDCB-Q812:ITIC and PDCB-DFQ812:ITIC, and the relevant characteristics are shown in Fig. 5b. The power-law dependence of JSC on illumination intensity can be expressed as JSC ∝ (Plight)a, where Plight is the light intensity and a is the exponential factor, which should be almost unity when the bimolecular recombination of the charge carriers is weak.57–59 The two devices exhibited a values of 0.95 and 0.97, respectively, illustrating that the device based on the fluorine-substituted polymer possessed weaker bimolecular recombination. These results agree well with the relatively higher JSC observed for PDCB-DFQ812:ITIC.

Morphological characterization
Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the effect of substitution on the morphology of the blend films. All films were fabricated under the optimum conditions. As shown in Fig. 6a–d, the non-fluorine quinoxaline-based blend films exhibited uniform and very smooth (roughness = 1.1 nm) morphology and no obvious phase separation was observed. However, in the case of the fluorinated polymer blend films, although they exhibited a slightly rougher surface topography, more fabric-like domains were observed compared with the non-fluorinated analogs, which is favorable for exciton separation and charge transport.37,60,61 Further morphological characterization of the copolymer:ITIC blend films obtained under the same conditions was carried out by TEM, as shown in Fig. 6e–g. All blend films show fibrillar network features, however, the blend films from fluorine quinoxaline-based copolymers (Fig. 6f and h) show larger bright and dark domains, which is desired for better charge separation, and thus agrees with the improved JSC and FF.29,62,63 The results are consistent with AFM images, which showed that the blend films based on the fluorine quinoxaline-based copolymers (Fig. 6b and d) exhibited larger roughness, which leads to effective pathways for exciton dissociation and charge transport. According to these results, one dramatic effect of fluorination on the conjugated polymer is better BHJ phase separation, which could improve JSC and FF simultaneously and thereby result in higher overall efficiencies.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of novel conjugated polymers based on dicyanodistyrylbenzene and quinoxaline units with different substituents were designed and synthesized for applications in PSCs. The results indicate that different alkyl chains on the thiophene π bridge had a minimal effect on the energy levels but a moderate effect on the absorption coefficients. In addition, the fluorine-substituted copolymers not only showed lower HOMO energy levels but also exhibited enhanced absorption coefficients and higher carrier mobilities than their non-fluorinated analogs, resulting in higher overall efficiencies. By using the low-bandgap acceptor ITIC, the PSCs based on PDCB-DFQ812 and PDCB-DFQ1014 reached high PCE values of 8.37% and 7.13%, respectively, with a high VOC of over 1 V. These are very encouraging results and demonstrate the effects of substituents on the copolymer absorption coefficient, charge transport, and photovoltaic efficiency. We believe that with an optimized substituent design, fluorinated quinoxaline-based conjugated polymers could deliver significantly improved photovoltaic efficiency.
