    , Accepted 12th November 2019First published on 14th November 2019AbstractIn this work, two small molecular electron acceptors (BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI) comprising a central bithiophene (BT) bridge and two fused perylene diimide (FPDI) units were designed and synthesized for fullerene-free organic solar cells (OSCs). The molecular geometry of these electron acceptors can be adjusted through a locked conformation via a photocyclization reaction. As expected, BT–FPDI has a highly twisted geometry with the assistance of the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) configuration of the FPDI unit and modest dihedral angles between FPDI and BT units, while fBT–FPDI shows a relatively planar geometry with symmetrically aligned FPDI wings. When paired with polymer donor PTB7-Th, the intrinsic configuration characteristic of BT–FPDI guaranteed an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.07% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.81 V, and a record high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.35 mA cm−2, which is almost the highest Jsc value reported for PDI-based fullerene-free OSCs. However, the optimal device employing fBT–FPDI as an electron acceptor delivered a PCE of only 5.89% with a significantly reduced Jsc of 12.30 mA cm−2. The interesting results show that, unlike traditional PDI molecules, the ring-fusion molecular design did not produce the desired positive effect in FPDI derivatives, and also provide a new insight into the regulation of the molecular geometry based on FPDI acceptors with an intrinsic quasi-2D structure.
Introduction
Recently, fullerene-free electron acceptors as alternatives of traditional fullerene electron acceptors for organic solar cells (OSCs) have undergone unprecedented progress because of their inherent advantages such as strong optical absorptivity, flexible tunability of optical band gaps and energy levels, long-term device stability, and so on.1–4 The latest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction fullerene-free OSCs have reached over 16%, showing great research prospects in breaking traditional efficiency barriers in fullerene-based OSCs.5–7 Among the numerous reported fullerene-free electron acceptors, perylene diimide (PDI) is one of the most studied and desirable electron-deficient units for constructing n-type electron acceptors because of the good absorption, high electron mobility, low-lying energy level and good chemical and environmental tolerance.8–12 However, the current state-of-the-art efficiencies of PDI-based OSCs still largely lag behind those of other fullerene-free acceptors.13–15 The main obstacle is the existence of strong intermolecular self-aggregation tendency, which results in unfavorable micrometer-sized phase separation in bulk-heterojunction films, thus leading to undesirable photovoltaic performance in OSCs since the exciton diffusion is typically within 10–20 nm.16–18 To address this problem, one strategy is to construct a twisted three-dimensional (3D) molecular geometry, which can partially suppress the strong intermolecular aggregation and reduce undesirable domain sizes in PDI-based fullerene-free OSCs.19–21 However, the excessively twisted 3D PDI molecules will reduce the intermolecular π–π interactions, and cause low crystallinity and charge transport.22 Another recent, successful and feasible design strategy is to construct a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) fused perylene diimide (FPDI) unit, which can efficiently prohibit the excessive self-aggregation due to a small built-in twisted molecular structure in FPDI unit which provides more favorable intermolecular interactions.23–25 As a result, better morphological compatibility between FPDI and the donor in the blend was observed, and significantly improved photovoltaic performances in either small or polymeric FPDI electron acceptor based OSCs were obtained in comparison with their PDI counterparts.26–29
It has been well-known that control of the molecular geometries is important to achieve promising photovoltaic performance of PDI-based OSCs.30–32 For example, a series of twisted PDI tetramers (TPC-PDI4, TPE-PDI4 and TPPz-PDI4, Fig. S1†) were synthesized by choosing central cores with various degrees of intramolecular twisting, and the result illustrated that reducing the intramolecular twisting can significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of the resulting molecules.33–35 Another example of geometrically controlled acceptor is clearly demonstrated through two bay linked PDI derivatives (Sdi-PBI-S and Sdi-PBI, Fig. S1†) with or without heteroannulation in bay regions, and the results showed that increasing the intramolecular twisting of Sdi-PBI-S (80° vs. 67°) can lead to more favorable phase separation and balanced charge mobility in the blend film.36 On the other hand, recently aromatic ring-fusion of PDI has also been shown to be effective in improving device performance in fullerene-free OSCs.11,37 It is always concluded that ring-fused PDI acceptors, such as PDI dimers, trimers or tetramers with phenylene, indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene, thiophene, furan and thienothiophene fusion bridges, normally possess better device performance in OSCs than their non-ring-fused counterparts.32,38,39 A classic example can be observed in two propeller-shaped PDI acceptors (βTPB6 and βTPB6-C, Fig. S1†), which proved that the aromatic ring-fusion strategy can help to enhance the charge transport ability, promote a stronger face-on orientation, and achieve higher PCEs.40 Similarly, Yan et al. reported two PDI-based tetramers (FTTB-PDI4 and TTB-PDI4, Fig. S1†) with a fused and non-fused configuration, and found that structural differences underlie the significantly superior electron transport ability and device performance of fused PDI tetramers than those of the non-fused counterpart.30 These results actually raised an argument on the balance between the formed intramolecular twisted geometries, which plays a significant role in restraining the strong self-aggregation of the PDI unit, and the rigidity of PDI through ring-fusion, which provides a better charge carrier generation efficiency. This therefore illustrates that although the formation of intramolecular twisted geometries seems to be a successful design strategy in obtaining better morphological domains for better device performance, the more or less detrimental effects on their electron transport capability in the blend from the increased steric hindrance also need to be considered, in which case increasing the rigidity of PDI derivative can handle this trade-off. This thus requires that the rigidity and molecular geometry of PDI acceptors should be carefully designed and controlled in order to pursue highly efficient PDI acceptors for OSC application. More importantly, to the best of our knowledge, such a design strategy has been rarely explored and investigated in promising FPDI-based electron acceptors with an intrinsic quasi-2D twisted configuration, which is realistically meaningful for further improving the efficiency of fullerene-free OSCs.
Herein, inspired and motivated by the previous FPDI studies by us and other groups,23–25,28 we designed and synthesized two FPDI-based electron acceptors (BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI), with unlocked or locked molecular geometries through non-fusing and fusing the bithiophene (BT) bridge at the inner bay position of two FPDI units (Scheme 1b). As expected, the unlocked and non-fusion BT–FPDI shows a more semi-flexible geometry with a large dihedral angle between FPDI and BT units, whereas fBT–FPDI possesses a completely different molecular geometry with restricted rotational freedom between FPDI and BT units after ring-fusion. The photovoltaic properties of devices were carefully optimized, and the fullerene-free OSCs based on the PTB7-Th:BT–FPDI blend shows a superior PCE of 8.07% with an impressive Jsc of 17.35 mA cm−2, whereas the ring-fused fBT–FPDI device gave an inferior PCE of 5.89%, and this result is a counterexample compared to previous reports. The origin of the different PCEs was then systematically investigated by comparing the optical–electronic properties, exciton dissociation efficiency, charge recombination dynamics, film morphology and molecular stacking behavior. These results indicate that even though ring-fusion in PDI derivatives is a generally recognized design strategy for PDI acceptors, the molecular geometry indeed plays a more important role in determining the photovoltaic performance, and this counterexample may open a new window to design novel PDI-based electron acceptors for achieving the state-of-the-art performance in fullerene-free OSCs.

Results and discussion
The chemical structures of BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI and the synthetic route are presented in Scheme 1. Briefly, BT–FPDI was synthesized by a classical Migita–Kosugi–Stille cross-coupling of the monobrominated-FPDI (FPDI-Br) and bithiophene distannyl compound with 82% yield. The ring-fused and locked analogues, fBT–FPDI, were then obtained through a photocyclization reaction with 80% yield. These fullerene-free acceptors are fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR to confirm their structures. BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI are readily soluble in common solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform and chlorobenzene, at room temperature.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of BT–FPDI, fBT–FPDI and the corresponding blend films are depicted in Fig. 1a. BT–FPDI shows two broad absorptions centered at 399 nm and 545 nm, corresponding to localized π–π* transitions and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), respectively, while fBT–FPDI gave a significant bathochromic shift due to the enlarged conjugation length with the increased planarity. It can be found that the ICT peak of fBT–FPDI is pronounced and red-shifted with two comparable maximum absorptions at 540 (0–1 transition peaks) and 590 nm (0–0 transition peaks), which is also the result of the stronger interaction between FPDI and BT units due to the more planar molecular geometry after ring-fusion. To elucidate the intermolecular interactions, temperature-dependent absorption spectra of BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI in chlorobenzene solution were collected and are shown in Fig. S3.† It can be found that both BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI show pronounced ICT absorption peaks between 30 °C and 100 °C, which suggests that temperature does not affect the intrinsic electronic interactions. As shown in Fig. S3a,† the absorption spectra of BT–FPDI showed a very weak blue-shift while increasing the temperature from 30 °C to 100 °C, and there are little changes in the high temperature range, which indicates that there are strong intermolecular interactions between the molecular geometries of BT–FPDI. In the case of fBT–FPDI, however, a large blue-shifted absorption can be found with the temperature increasing from 30 °C to 100 °C, indicating weaker intermolecular interactions than that of BT–FPDI. Upon cooling, the absorption spectra of both BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI can return to their original status (Fig. S3b and d†). These results demonstrated that BT–FPDI has a stronger aggregation effect even in the solution state than fBT–FPDI, and a possible reason for the different temperature-dependent aggregation behaviors of BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI is the synergistic contribution of polarization-induced inter-chain and torsion-induced intra-chain disorders.41,42 The optical band gaps of BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI calculated from the onset of film absorption are 1.9 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. Moreover, BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI-based blend films all displayed strong and broad absorption response ranging from 300 to 750 nm, which is more desirable for capturing more photons and resulting in high current density in OSCs. It is interesting that the BT–FPDI-based blend exhibited a higher maximum molar extinction coefficient (6.7 × 104 M−1 cm−1) than the fBT–FPDI film (2.7 × 104 M−1 cm−1) (Fig. S1a†), which is much helpful for better light harvesting, and an increased short-circuit current density is expected. The possible reason for this enhanced absorption ability of BT–FPDI is that the ring fusion may alter the electron distribution of the frontier orbitals, which gives a large transition probability.43 The optical properties of BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI demonstrated that the ring fusion had a large effect on both their absorption intensity and profile.

The electrochemical properties of BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI are investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements and the energy level diagram is provided in Fig. 1b. The CV curves show that both the acceptors exhibit reversible reduction peaks and no obvious oxidation peaks can be identified (Fig. S2b†), which is similar to that of the reported FPDI-based acceptors.25–28 According to the reduction onsets and calibration of the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI are estimated to be −4.09 and −3.96 eV, respectively, and then the HOMO energy levels also can be calculated as −5.99 and −5.96 eV (Fig. 1b). Similar to previous ring-fusion cases,30,32,39 the fused molecule (fBT–FPDI) showed an upshifted LUMO level relative to the non-fused one (BT–FPDI) due to the delocalization of frontier molecular orbitals, which was expected to result in higher Voc in the related fullerene-free OSCs. Moreover, large HOMO and LUMO offsets between the polymer donor and electron acceptors also can be observed, thus creating enough driving force for the efficient exciton dissociation in devices.
To gain deeper insight into the effect of the different molecular geometries in BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI molecules, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP/6-31G level, and the calculated results are shown in Fig. 1c and the ESI.† It can be clearly seen that the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of unlocked BT–FPDI are exclusively delocalized on FPDI and BT moieties, respectively, whereas ring fusion alters the electron distribution of frontier orbitals and slight amounts of extended frontier molecular orbitals can be observed as seen from the pink circle in Fig. S4.† The DFT simulation LUMO/HOMO levels of BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI acceptors were calculated to be −3.68/−5.73 and −3.62/−5.97 eV, respectively, which are well consistent with the CV measurements (Fig. 1b). As mentioned previously, the ring-fusion design route plays a critical role in optimizing the molecular geometry and achieving superior performance in traditional PDI molecules, but leaves a large gap to be filled in understanding its effect on FPDI acceptors with quasi-2D features. As expected, BT–FPDI shows a relatively twisted molecular configuration with a high degree of rotational freedom, and the dihedral angles are calculated to be 24.5°, 119.7°, 12.9°, 58.1° and 23.9°, respectively. After the photocyclization reaction, the rotation between FPDI and BT is completely locked with resulting torsional angles of θ1 = 23.7°, θ2 = 0.5°, θ3 = 14.9°, θ4 = 0.3° and θ5 = 23.7°, owing to the less intramolecular twisting of the locked fBT–FPDI (Fig. 1c). Therefore, the FPDI molecules, BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI, exhibit distinctly different molecular geometries, thus providing a suitable platform for a deep understanding of the structure–property relationship of FPDI-based fullerene-free electron acceptors.
To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of these fullerene-free electron acceptors, fullerene-free OSC devices with a conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/PFN-Br/Ag were fabricated. The details and optimization of BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI devices can be found in the ESI (Fig. S5 and S6, Tables S1 and S2†). The corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of these devices based on BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI blends are shown in Fig. 2a, and their optimized device parameters are summarized in Table 1. In the case of PTB7-Th:BT–FPDI, we can see that thermal annealing (TA) treatment dramatically increased Jsc and FF, thus leading to a remarkable PCE of 7.8% with a Voc of 0.81 V, Jsc of 16.96 mA cm−2 and FF of 56.9% (Fig. S5 and Table S1†). Then, a slightly improved PCE of 8.07% with a record high Jsc of 17.35 mA cm−2 can be achieved after adding a small amount of additive (0.5% DIO) in the solution of PBT7-Th:BT–FPDI (Fig. 2a). To the best of our knowledge, the observed Jsc of 17.35 mA cm−2 in PTB7-Th:BT–FPDI is the highest value reported to date for PDI-based OSCs. In contrast, when the fused derivative fBT–FPDI was used as the electron acceptor, TA treatment delivered a lower PCE of 5.47% with a slight increased Voc of 0.82 V, which also matched well with the upshifted LUMO level of fBT–FPDI. In addition to TA, a small volume fraction of DIO (0.25%) is subsequently applied, leading to an enhanced PCE of 5.89% with a Voc of 0.83 V, and an inferior Jsc of 12.30 mA cm−2 (Table 1). As discussed above, it is known that the ring-fusion strategy has shown significant efficiency improvement in previous PDI systems,30,32,39 but it is a counterexample in the case of BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI-based OSCs. For the PTB7-Th:fBT–FPDI device, its unexpected efficiency loss is mainly due to the remarkably lower current density. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI devices are shown in Fig. 2b. The fullerene-free PTB7-Th:BT–FPDI device showed a broad photo response from 300 to 780 nm with a maximum EQE value of 79.2%, while the fBT–FPDI device exhibited a similar but weaker photo response profile with a maximum EQE of 64.1%, which can partly explain the significant current density difference in the photovoltaic devices. In addition, the integrated Jsc values of BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI blends based on the EQE spectra are 16.73 mA cm−2 and 12.25 mA cm−2, respectively, which are well consistent with the Jsc values obtained from J–V measurement (Table 1).

To compare the exciton dissociation, charge recombination and collection properties of the two fullerene-free OSCs with BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI as electron acceptors, we investigated the exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss), the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax), and the dependence of Jsc on light intensity according to the reported method,44 and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 3a and b. The saturation currents (Jsat) of BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI devices are calculated to be 21.13 mA cm−2 and 15.16 mA cm−2, respectively. Accordingly, a charge dissociation probability (Pdiss) of 82.1% was achieved for the PTB7-Th:BT–FPDI device, which was comparable with that of the fBT–FPDI device (82.7%) under short-circuit and maximum power conditions. In addition, the fullerene-free OSCs based on the PTB7-Th:BT–FPDI blend delivered a high Gmax value of 1.08 × 1028 m−3 s−1, whereas the fBT–FPDI device gave a Gmax value of 8.13 × 1027 m−3 s−1, which are in good agreement with the higher molar extinction coefficient (6.7 × 104 M−1 cm−1) of the BT–FPDI blend and the record high current density (17.35 mA cm−2) of the BT–FPDI device. On the other hand, the incident light intensity dependence of Jsc was also investigated to have a better understanding of the carrier recombination mechanism in the two fullerene-free OSCs. As shown in Fig. 3b, the PTB7-Th:BT–FPDI device showed a higher slope of 0.987 than the fBT–FPDI-based device (S = 0.973), indicating that relatively weak bimolecular recombination occurred in the BT–FPDI device. To gain deeper insight into the charge transport properties of these fullerene-free OSCs, we further measured the hole and electron mobilities of BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI devices by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. 3c and d). For the PTB7-Th:BT–FPDI blend, the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) are estimated to be 6.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a balanced charge transport (μh/μe of 1.49), while the PTB7-Th:fBT–FPDI blend shows a similar and more balanced charge carrier transport (μh/μe of 1.20). Consequently, BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI showed similar exciton dissociation probabilities and balanced charge transport, but the higher exciton generation rate and weaker bimolecular recombination for BT–FPDI devices synergistically contributed to the higher current density and better device performance.

To gain more insight into the molecular packing of both the pristine and blend films, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was carried out, and the 2D GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding line-cut scattering profiles in the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions are shown in Fig. 4. The neat BT–FPDI film has an obvious (010) diffraction peak at 1.45 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 4.33 Å in the OOP direction and the corresponding (100) peak is observed at 0.28 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 22.44 Å, indicating a preferential face-on orientation in the neat BT–FPDI film. However, the pristine fBT–FPDI film shows a random molecular orientation and the weaker π–π (010) and lamellar (100) diffraction peaks are found at 1.45 Å−1 (d-spacing of 4.33 Å) and 0.36 Å−1 (d-spacing of 17.45 Å), respectively. Similarly, the non-fused BT–FPDI showed strong packing behavior compared to the more planar fBT–FPDI as observed from the results of GIWAXS, which is consistent with the temperature-dependent absorption results, but opposite to the DFT calculations. In order to further compare the molecular packing orientations in BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI, analysis of scattering intensity distribution as a function of the azimuth angle was performed (Fig. 4c). It can be seen that both the BT–FPDI pristine film and PTB7-Th:BT–FPDI blend film exhibited strong scattering intensities in comparison with the fBT–FPDI pristine film and PTB7-Th:fBT–FPDI blend film, which means that there exists stronger molecular packing in BT–FPDI pristine and its blend films. On account of this we can find that the BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI neat films show entirely different molecular packing orientations (preferential face-on vs. amorphous properties), implying that the molecular orientation and crystallization behavior of the resulting molecules can be manipulated significantly via the ring-fusion strategy. As for the neat PTB7-Th film, a strong π–π stacking diffraction peak at 1.57 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 4.0 Å is only observed in the OOP direction (Fig. S7†).
 Fig. 4  Two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns (a), scattering profiles (b) and azimuth intensity profiles (c) for the pristine films of BT–FPDI and fBT-FPDI, and blend films of PTB7-Th:BT–FPDI and PTB7-Th:fBT–FPDI. 
From Fig. 4, it can find that the PTB7-Th/BT–FPDI blend film did not show any obvious change in the crystallization behavior of BT–FPDI, but a significantly pronounced (010) π–π stacking peak at 1.57 × 10−1 is observed in the OOP direction, which is from PTB7-Th and expected to be beneficial for the vertical charge transport in the blend film. However, the addition of PTB7-Th led to a significant change in the molecular orientation of fBT–FPDI, and the change of the stacking orientation from an isotropic crystallite orientation in the neat film to a predominant face-on orientation in the blend film can be observed from the 2D patterns and the azimuth intensity profiles. In addition, the scattering intensity of (010) peaks of the BT–FPDI blend film is much stronger than that of the fBT–FPDI blend, indicating that there is a highly ordered packing and a preference for a face-on oriented π–π stacking in PTB7-Th:BT–FPDI, which can partly explain the significantly enhanced current density obtained from the BT–FPDI-based fullerene-free OSC. On the other hand, the values of the π–π stacking coherence length of the two blend films were calculated from the full width at half maximum of the OOP (010) peaks using the Scherrer equation.45 The PTB7-Th/BT–FPDI blend exhibits a slightly larger (010) coherence length than the PTB7-Th and fBT–FPDI blend (8.05 nm vs. 7.43 nm), which is beneficial to enhance the molecular packing and charge transport in fullerene-free OSCs.
In order to understand the effect of the surface morphology of the photoactive layer, which is crucial to the device performance, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed, and the corresponding images are shown in Fig. 5. It can be found that the photoactive layers based on BT–FPDI (Fig. 5a and b) and fBT–FPDI (Fig. 5d and e) acceptors were highly uniform and smooth, and no large fibrillary aggregates were observed in the AFM images, implying good miscibility and morphology compatibility between PTB7-Th and FPDI acceptors. Additionally, the root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) value for the BT–FPDI blend film was calculated to be 0.877 nm, while a slightly increased Rq value of 0.931 nm was observed in the fBT–FPDI film because of its more rigid molecular configuration. A similar phenomenon can also be observed in the TEM images (Fig. 5c and f); more defined nanoscale phase separation features and appropriate domain sizes are seen in the two films, which may contribute to the promotion of the exciton dissociation efficiency and charge transport properties, therefore resulting in impressive photovoltaic performance of fullerene-free OSC devices. These GIWAXS, AFM and TEM results helped explain the significant differences in device performance, especially Jsc and FF, resulting from controlling the molecular geometry of FPDI fullerene-free acceptors with a built-in quasi-2D configuration.

In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized two novel electron acceptors (BT–FPDI and fBT–FPDI) with different steric configurations for fullerene-free OSCs. The density functional theory calculations show that BT–FPDI preserved the suitable twisted connection between BT and FPDI units, preventing large undesirable phase aggregation and crystallinity in the blend film. After ring fusion, the molecular geometry of fBT–FPDI could be significantly manipulated and formed a relatively rigid planar configuration, enhancing the intermolecular π–π interaction, molecular ordered packing and also symmetrically aligned the FPDI moieties. The optimal fullerene-free conventional OSCs based on PTB7-Th:BT–FPDI delivered an impressive PCE of 8.07% with a champion Jsc of 17.35 mA cm−2, which is among the highest current density reported to date for PDI-based photovoltaic devices. On the other hand, when using the fused molecule (fBT–FPDI) as the electron acceptor, the best devices with 0.25% DIO treatment showed an inferior PCE of 5.89% with a significantly lower Jsc of 12.30 mA cm−2, which is attributed to the lower molar extinction coefficient, stronger bimolecular recombination and unfavorable packing properties of the fBT–FPDI-based blend film. Our preliminary investigations illustrated that geometrically controlled FPDI molecules have great potential and could be promising electron acceptor candidates for high performance fullerene-free OSCs.
Experimental section
Materials
Monomer FPDI-Br and 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene were synthesized using known procedures.46–48 PTB7-Th (Mw: 47000, polydispersity index: 2.0) was purchased from Derthon Optoelectronic Materials Science Technology Co Ltd. All chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise specified.
Synthesis of BT–FPDI
A solution of FPDI-Br (400 mg, 0.27 mmol) and 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (53.6 mg, 0.11 mmol) monomers in toluene (40 mL) was degassed under N2 three times. Then, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (10.1 mg, 0.01 mmol) and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (20.2 mg, 0.07 mmol) were quickly added, and the solution mixture was further evacuated and refilled with N2 three times and then was heated at 110 °C for 12 h under nitrogen. After cooling to room temperature, the resultant solution was removed under reduced pressure and the product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (petroleum ether/dichloromethane, 2:1 to 1:2, v/v) to yield dark brown solid BT–FPDI (270 mg, 0.09 mmol, 82%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3) δ 10.79 (d, 8H), 10.44 (s, 1H), 9.41 (d, 8H), 7.54 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 1H), 7.36 (d, J = 2.4 Hz, 2H), 7.28 (d, J = 10.0 Hz, 4H), 7.11 (ddd, J = 8.5, 2.1 Hz, 2H), 5.48 (d, 8H), 2.48 (d, 16H), 2.03 (d, J = 7.0 Hz, 16H), 1.31 (dd, 99H), 0.96–0.81 (m, 46H). 13C NMR (151 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 149.21, 149.18, 147.69, 147.64, 147.04, 146.62, 145.47, 138.96, 138.94, 138.77, 138.70, 138.54, 138.48, 136.91, 136.21, 135.32, 134.88, 134.11, 134.08, 134.05, 134.00, 127.47, 127.37, 127.35, 126.95, 126.86, 126.62, 125.84, 124.48, 124.39, 124.01, 123.50, 122.73, 119.13, 119.02, 118.90, 35.00, 34.89, 34.55, 34.46, 32.49, 31.95, 31.89, 31.53, 31.46, 30.22, 30.16, 29.72, 29.68, 29.38, 29.36, 26.81, 22.71, 22.64, 14.14.
Synthesis of fBT–FPDI
In a photochemical reactor covered with a thick layer of aluminium foil, BT–FPDI (150 mg, 0.05 mmol) and iodine (60 mg) were dissolved in 360 mL of toluene. Then, the solution mixture was photoirradiated using a 450 W mercury lamp for 36 h with cooling. The reaction mixture was terminated until the starting material could not be detected by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The reaction solution was removed under reduced pressure and the product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (petroleum ether/dichloromethane, 2:1 to 1:2, v/v) to yield fBT–FPDI as a dark red solid (120 mg, 0.04 mmol, 80%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3) δ 10.33 (s, 8H), 9.47 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 4H), 9.23 (s, 5H), 8.92 (d, 1H), 7.54 (d, 4H), 5.35 (s, 8H), 2.37 (s, 16H), 1.98 (s, 16H), 1.44–1.27 (m, 98H), 0.85 (d, 46H). 13C NMR (151 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 164.90, 164.10, 163.79, 163.76, 162.31, 143.94, 139.60, 133.98, 133.80, 133.61, 133.04, 132.98, 129.75, 129.69, 128.59, 127.31, 126.95, 126.92, 126.91, 126.55, 126.53, 126.21, 126.03, 125.84, 124.34, 123.93, 123.92, 123.50, 55.19, 55.10, 35.00, 34.89, 34.55, 34.46, 32.43, 31.95, 31.80, 31.53, 31.46, 30.22, 30.16, 29.72, 26.75, 22.71, 22.60, 14.10.
