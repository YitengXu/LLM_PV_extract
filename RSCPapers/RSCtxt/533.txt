    , Accepted 30th April 2009First published on 8th June 2009AbstractThe development of efficient red sensitizer dyes is essential for the optimization of dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical solar cells. Ru-phthalocyanines are good candidates because they show high absorbance in the red while their axial ligands hinder the formation of aggregates, a recurrent problem among phthalocyanine dyes. In this paper, we present the photophysics and photovoltaic device performance for a series of novel Ru-phthalocyanines. We focus in particular upon the origin of the enhancement in device performance observed in the presence of two additives, Li+ and chenodeoxycholic acid. The addition of Li+ lowers the conduction band edge of the TiO2 semiconductor leading to a higher electron injection yield and a higher photocurrent in the device. The increases in injection yield and photocurrent are large for these sensitizers, compared to the widely studied ruthenium bipyridyl dye N719, due to the relatively slow injection dynamics, emphasizing the importance of injection yield in limiting device performance for this Ru-phthalocyanine dye series. Of particular interest is the effect of chenodeoxycholic acid. This coadsorbent dramatically enhances the photocurrent of the studied devices without lowering the photovoltage. Unlike previous studies, in this case the photocurrent rise can not be attributed to an increment in the electron injection yield due to the effect of the coadsorbent hindering the formation of dye aggregates. Photophysical measurements instead show that the slower recombination of dye cations with the TiO2 electrons and faster regeneration of the dye cations by the electrolyte are the reasons for the enhanced photocurrent.
1 Introduction
There is increasing interest in the development of cheap, efficient solar cells for low cost renewable energy generation. Nanostructured dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are good candidates to fulfill the above requirements;1 significant research efforts over the last 15 years have rendered a gradual but steady increase in the efficiency of these systems from ∼7% reported in the early nineties1 to values over 11% achieved in the current state-of-the-art cells.2 One of the possible strategies to further increase the efficiency of these systems is the development of new dyes with stronger absorbance in the red region of the solar spectrum. The most efficient dyes reported to date are typically Ru-polypyridine complexes with maximal visible molar absorption coefficients of ≤20000 M−1 cm−1,3,4 usually centered in the green spectral region, and exhibiting only poor red/near infrared absorption, an energetically rich part of the solar spectrum. These limitations are motivating the search for sensitizer with stronger, longer wavelength optical absorption. Phthalocyanines (Pc) are a family of dyes characterised for their strong absorbance in the red,5 with molar absorption coefficients close to/or over 100000 M −1cm−1. Such strong light absorption should enhance solar light absorption and allow the use of thinner semiconductor films for DSSCs, potentially leading to more efficient and cheaper photovoltaic devices. An additional advantage of Pc is their low absorbance around 500 nm, which gives them an attractive and characteristic blue-green colour, very suitable for the potential application of Pc sensitized solar cells as windows or as partner dyes in cosensitized or tandem DSSCs alongside existing Ru-polypyridine dyes. Among the different types of Pc, Ru-phthalocyanines (RuPc) are of special interest because of the versatility provided by their axial ligands. The ligands are known to hinder the formation of aggregates,6 a common problem among Pcs, and can moreover be used to tune the redox properties7 and colour (from green to blue) of the dye.
A further strategy to improve the efficiency of DSSCs is the use of coadsorbents. Coadsorbents are typically transparent compounds or ions which adsorb together with the dye on the mesoporous semiconductor surface. They are used because their presence improves, sometimes dramatically, the efficiency of a given cell, but the reason for their beneficial effect is not always understood and their usage is often empirical, based on a trial and error of different compounds and concentrations. Two examples of coadsorbents, widely used in the field, are chenodeoxycholic acid (CHENO) and the small cation Li+.

        CHENO is a transparent, organic compound which binds strongly to the surface of nanostructured TiO2, being able to displace dye molecules from the semiconductor surface and therefore hindering the formation of dye aggregates.8–12 It is known to improve DSSC efficiency,8–11,13–15 generally attributed to it preventing dye aggregation, resulting in improved electron injection efficiency, and thus leading to an increase in the device photocurrent. Moreover, in some cases, the use of CHENO has also led to a rise in the photovoltage. This latter effect has been attributed to a decrease of recombination of the injected electrons with the redox electrolyte.10–12,14,15
While CHENO mainly affects the dye, Li+, on the other hand, acts on the semiconductor. Because of their small size, Li+ ions adsorb on the TiO2 surface, charging it positively. The net effect is that the presence of Li+ will affect the flat band potential of TiO2, “pulling down” the conduction band (CB) edge and therefore accelerating electron injection.16 The effect of this on the yield of electron injection will depend upon the relative timescales of electron injection and excited state decay to the ground state. Li+ is expected to have a larger effect on the electron injection yield for dyes with lower energy injecting states such as those obtained from the absorption of red photons. The downside is that lowering the CB edge leads to a loss of the maximum photovoltage that we can extract from the device. Consequently, a compromise between the increase of photocurrent and the decrease of photovoltage has to be reached when using Li+.
From a photophysical point of view, a working DSSC can be schematized as a series of electron transfer reactions (Fig. 1), some beneficial (electron injection, dye regeneration, electron migration to the external circuit), some leading to losses (excited state decay, electron recombination with the dye cation or the electrolyte). An efficient device will require that all the involved electron transfer processes are optimized. In practice, this is a delicate and crucial point because optimization of one reaction (e.g.: electron migration by using higher absorption coefficient dyes and thinner TiO2 films) can affect negatively another of the involved processes, potentially leading to poorer device performance. It is therefore essential, as part of the evolving process to achieve highly efficient DSSC, that a good understanding of the effects of coadsorbents and dyes on both the devices photophysics and performance is achieved.

We have previously reported on the slow electron injection observed for a RuPc sensitized TiO217 and the effect of the Pc ring in catalysing the unwanted recombination of the TiO2 (e−) with the redox electrolyte, which leads to a significant loss of open circuit photovoltage.18 We extend our study of RuPc herein, presenting a novel series of Ru-phthalocyanines (Fig. 2) as sensitizers for DSSCs and the effect of two popular coadsorbents, Li+ and CHENO, on the devices photophysics and performance. The study is an example of the complementarity of spectroscopic and optoelectronic techniques and how both are needed to obtain a detailed understanding of DSSCs.

2 Results and discussion
2.1 
          Dye synthesis
RuPcs bearing two axial carboxypyridine ligands have been previously described and tested in DSSCs19,20 with overall conversion efficiencies (η) of 0.61%.20
Here, we describe the preparation of new Ru(II)Pc derivatives RuPcA2–6 incorporating two different axial pyridine ligands, one of them being a 4-carboxypyridine and the second one a 4-substituted pyridine bearing a electron-donor or electron-withdrawing substituent that could serve to modulate the electronic properties of the phthalocyanines (Fig. 2). The carboxylic acid function will play the role of anchoring group to attach these dyes onto the surface of TiO2. Moreover, the incorporation of secondary donor groups such as triphenylamine in the dye structure is well documented in the literature to elongate the lifetime of the charge separated states and the overall efficiency of the devices. In this regard, ligand b has been designed to play this role. Therefore, Ru(II)Pcs A1–6 represent a new attractive family of molecules to be tested in DSSCs.
Classical methods for the preparation of Ru(II)Pcs imply the cyclotetramerization of a phthalonitrile precursor in the presence of a ruthenium salt. However, better results are obtained by insertion of the ruthenium into the preformed metal-free macrocycle using the Ru3(CO)12 reagent in refluxing benzonitrile.21 Thus, the tetra-(tert-butyl)bis(benzonitrile)RuPc22 was obtained in 56% after column chromatography on silica gel. The labile benzonitrile ligands can be easily substituted by pyridines ones, which stay strongly bound to the Ru(II) center. Sun et al. reported in 2005 the axial exchange of picoline ligands by other pyridines in RuPcs using quite harsh conditions (heating at ca. 160 °C in a high boiling solvent such as 1,2-dichlorobenzene).23 This reaction leads to a complex reaction mixture which is difficult to purify.
In our case, the axial unsymmetrically substituted derivatives RuPcA2–6 were prepared directly from tetra-(tert-butyl)bis(benzonitrile)RuPc, using a mixture of 4-carboxypyridine (ligand a) and a differently 4-substituted pyridine ligand (ligands b–f, R = Ph2NC6H4, Ph2N, CN, OMe, Me, respectively) (Scheme 1). The reaction was carried out in refluxing THF in order to get ligand a to be solubilised. The reaction conditions were optimised to obtain a good yield of the axial unsymmetrically substituted RuPc derivative RuPcA. By using a molar ratio of 1:3 (ligand b–f : ligand a) compounds RuPcA2–6 could be obtained in 30% yield after column chromatography on silica gel. Obviously, in the reaction mixture the symmetrically substituted compounds RuPcA1 and RuPcS2–6 were also present and could be isolated by column chromatography in 36% and 20% yield, respectively.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of the RuPcA1–6dyes 

Pyridine ligands a and c–f are commercially available compounds. Ligands b and c were prepared by means of palladium mediated cross-coupling reactions (Scheme 2). Pyridine b was synthesized in 93% yield by a Suzuki-Miyaura reaction from 4-bromopyridinium hydrochloride and two equivalents of 4-(N,N-diphenylamino)phenylboronic acid24 using a heterogeneous Pd(0)/C catalyst. 4-(N,N-Diphenylamino)pyridine (ligand c) was prepared from 4-bromopyridinium hydrochloride, which was reacted with 1.2 equivalents of diphenylamine using the standard Buchwald amination conditions.
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of pyridine ligands b and c. 
The structures of these compounds were unambiguously established by means of different spectroscopic techniques, namely 1H NMR, MS, UV-Vis and IR.

1H NMR spectra of compounds RuPcA2–6 were recorded in d6-DMSO in order to get well resolved signals. Although they are ready soluble in CHCl3, spectra registered in CDCl3 showed broad signals indicative of aggregation. Since the axial substituents prevent the phthalocyanine macrocycles from interacting with each other, the polar carboxylic group may be responsible for the aggregation of these molecules in solvents such as CHCl3. The pyridine coordination at the apical positions of the macrocycle can be easily followed by 1H NMR since these protons appeared significantly upfield shifted due to ring current effects. In the case of the unsymmetrically substituted derivatives RuPcA2–6, four sets of signals are observed in the spectrum assigned to the two different pyridine ligands: two doublets between 5.0 and 5.5 ppm and two doublets between 2.0 and 2.5 ppm (Fig. 3).

          Dye characterization: electronic absorption and emission spectra, cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations

2.2.1 Electronic absorption and emission spectra. 
In solution (2-propanol), all the dyes present two strong bands with maxima at 313 and 630 nm, the B and Q bands,6 respectively (Fig. 4). There are also one or two smaller bands in the region from 350 to 500 nm. The position and number of these weaker bands depend on the nature of the axial ligands and can therefore be attributed to charge transfer (CT) states between the metal and the ligands. Because of the strong similarity between all the spectra, it seems that there is not a significant interaction between the CT and the B and Q states. The only exception is RuPcA4 (–CN substituted pyridine) where the Q band is broader and less structured than in the other compounds.
 Fig. 4  
Absorption spectra of RuPcA1, RuPcA2, RuPcA3, RuPcA4, RuPcA5 and RuPcA6 in isopropanol. The spectra have been normalized at 313 nm for the sake of comparison. 
There are no significant changes on the absorption spectra of the dyes when adsorbed onto nanostructured TiO2 (see ESI,† Fig. S1). This suggests that even at high dye concentrations and in the absence of CHENO, no dye aggregates are formed, consistent with axial ligands preventing π–π stacking. When sensitizing the films in the presence of CHENO, this coadsorbent has a very strong effect on the amount of dye uploaded (see Fig. 8A later), as expected.8–12 The binding of the dye to the semiconductor is not strong. Covering the sensitized semiconductor with a drop of propylene carbonate causes desorption of some of the dye molecules. On the other side, when coadsorbed with CHENO, no significant dye desorption is observed, that is, there are less dye molecules adsorbed, but they are more strongly bound. A similar effect has been observed before with N719 coadsorbed with tetrabutylammonium chenodeoxycholate.25
In air-equilibrated solution, all the dyes presented two weak emission bands. There is one narrow band, around 690 nm, which can be attributed to fluorescence26 and another, broader band around 830 nm due to phosphorescence.27 The precise position of the bands and the intensity ratio between the bands vary depending on the substituent (see ESI,† Table S1).

            Cyclic voltammetry
          . 
The oxidation potentials of the RuPcs depend on the nature of the axial ligand. As could be expected, the higher the electron donating character of the ligand, the easier to oxidize is the RuPc. The effect, however, is not very large. The oxidation potentials span from 0.67 V vs.SCE for RuPcA1 to 0.537 V vs.SCE for RuPcA3 (see ESI,† Table S1 for full details). The values and trend are in good agreement with previous reports on other RuPcs.7


2.2.3 DFT calculations. 
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out on RuPcA1 and RuPcA2 to investigate the effect of the axial ligands on the nature of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). In both cases, the HOMO was exclusively located in the phthalocyanine ring. This is an indication that upon oxidation of the dye, the resulting hole will be located in the Pc ring. Since dye cation-TiO2 (e−) recombination is strongly dependent on the hole-semiconductor surface distance28 and this distance is assumed to be the same for all the studied dyes, similar dye cation-TiO2 (e−) recombination dynamics are expected for all the dyes.

2.3 Effects of Li+ and CHENO on the device efficiency

RuPcA5 was chosen as a model dye to investigate the effects of Li+ and CHENO on DSSC performance. To investigate the effect of CHENO, sensitized films were prepared with and without this coadsorbent. To investigate the effect of Li+ two types of electrolyte were used, EL1 and EL2. EL1 was a Li+ based electrolyte, 0.25 M LiI/I2 in propylene carbonate, while in EL2 the Li+ was replaced by a large cation, tetrabutylammonium (TBA). Three types of devices were prepared, named as D1 (containing EL1 and using CHENO as coadsorbent), D2 (containing EL1) and D3 (containing EL2 and CHENO as coadsorbent).
The observed trends in device performance were very clear. If we compare D1 vs. D3, Li+ improves JSC, the short circuit photocurrent, dramatically, almost doubling its value, but there is a decrease in VOC, the open circuit photovoltage (Fig. 5 and Table 1). While an increase of photocurrent was expected, the magnitude of the effect suggests that kinetic competition between injection and excited state decay to ground state is particularly important for this sensitizer, as we discuss below. The large increase in photocurrent results in the addition of Li+ improving the cell performance even though the photovoltage is lowered.

Adding CHENO, on the other hand (devices D1 vs. D2; Fig. 6), dramatically improves the photocurrent and to a lesser extent the photovoltage. Both effects have also been observed before.10,11,15 The increase on photovoltage has been attributed to a decrease of recombination of the injected electrons with the redox electrolyte in previous reports.10–12,14 In our case, however, the increase in photocurrent generation is large enough to account for the observed increase in photovoltage. On the other hand, the increase in photocurrent is usually attributed to the effect of CHENO breaking dye aggregates8,9,13 thus improving electron injection into the semiconductor.10,11 While this is a very plausible explanation for the behaviour observed in the previously reported systems, the effect of CHENO on the injection dynamics has not been measured. In the systems studied here, the increase in photocurrent is rather surprising since the phthalocyanines were especially designed to minimize the formation of aggregates and steady state absorption studies did not show any indication of such. To clarify this issue, we studied the devices photophysics and electron transfer dynamics.

2.4 Effects of Li+ and CHENO on the electron transfer dynamics
The photoinduced dynamics of RuPc sensitized films covered by electrolyte and of complete, working DSSCs were studied by flash-photolysis. Several electron transfer reactions are of importance for the efficiency of a DSSC, as shown in Fig. 1. Among these processes electron injection into the semiconductor CB, recombination of the oxidized dyes with the electrons in TiO2 and regeneration of the oxidized dye by the redox electrolyte were studied and will be discussed in the following paragraphs. Since all the RuPc dyes exhibited similar behaviour, we again focus on RuPcA5 in our discussion.

2.4.1 Electron injection into TiO2. 
We had previously reported that electron injection from an excited RuPc (RuPcA4) into TiO2 was very slow, on the order of hundreds of ns, due to the poor coupling between the dye and the semiconductor and the fact that the electron injecting state was an energetically low lying triplet state.17RuPcA5, our model dye, and indeed all the RuPcs presented here, show very similar behaviour to RuPcA4. Fig. 7 shows the transient absorption dynamics of RuPcA5 sensitized TiO2 in propylene carbonate with and without Li+ (0.25 M LiClO4) at 525 nm, where both the dye cation17,27 and the dye triplet17,19 absorb strongly. In pure propylene carbonate, the dynamics are biphasic, with a fast decay component in the sub-microsecond timescale, and a very slow component which decays in ms (see below). Since the triplet state lifetime of RuPc in solution is on the order of hundreds of ns,17,19 there is no doubt that the slow component can be attributed to the decay of the dye cation. The fast component can be attributed to the decay of the triplet state of RuPcA5, indicating slow (100s of nanoseconds) electron injection dynamics into TiO2, in agreement with our previous report. On the other hand, in the presence of Li+, the fast component disappears and the amplitude of the slow component increases significantly. This can be readily explained by the effect of Li+ on the CB edge. Lowering the edge of the band leads to a higher number of electron acceptor states available and therefore to faster electron injection dynamics, outside the time window of our experiment, and thus to a higher yield of electron injection and dye cation formation.
 Fig. 7  Comparison of the transient absorption traces of RuPcA5|TiO2 and (RuPcA5 + LiClO4)|TiO2 at 525 nm (maximum of absorption of the dye cation) after excitation at 650 nm. 

Fig. 8A shows the absorption spectra of two TiO2 films sensitized with and without CHENO. As mentioned above, the dye loading on TiO2 is strongly reduced in the presence of CHENO. The corresponding transient absorption dynamics of these two samples covered by propylene carbonate are shown in Fig. 8B. On the monitored timescale, the observed dynamics are very similar, both samples show the fast and slow components, respectively assigned to the triplet and dye cation decays, described above. It is apparent that the film with CHENO exhibits a smaller transient signal, indicative of a lower yield of RuPc cations. Moreover, if the amplitude of the signal is corrected by the density of photons absorbed by each sample (due to different optical densities), the traces are essentially identical (Fig. 8C), indicating that the lower signal observed in the presence of CHENO results only from the lower dye loading reducing the density of absorbed photons. The similarity of the normalized traces shown in Fig. 8C indicates, rather unexpectedly, that CHENO does not affect the electron injection quantum yield, and therefore the dynamics, of the RuPc sensitized TiO2. Rather the presence of CHENO reduces the dye loading of the film, and thus the net flux of light absorption and electron injection. It is thus apparent that neither changes in dye loading nor injection quantum yield are able to explain the enhanced device photocurrent observed in the presence of CHENO.

C) Same traces as B, but the amplitude of the signals has been normalized by the amount of photons absorbed by each sample. 


2.4.2 Recombination of dye cation with TiO2 (e−). 
The recombination of the oxidized dye molecules with the electrons in TiO2 was studied, as in the case of electron injection, in the presence of a redox inactive electrolyte to simplify the analysis of the dynamics. The samples were excited at 650 nm, with low energy pulses (∼50 µJ/cm2) to ensure that the monitored dynamics would not be dependent on the different number of photons absorbed by each sample (films with CHENO have much lower absorption than those without, see Fig. 8A). For the same reason, 740 nm was chosen as the probe wavelength since the ground state absorption of the RuPc at this wavelength is negligible.
In pure solvent, with no additives, the recombination dynamics of RuPcA5+˙ is rather slow, with a half time on the order of a few ms. In the presence of Li+, the recombination becomes faster and the half time of the dye cation spans from hundreds of µs to a few ms, depending on the sample and, especially, on the TiO2 paste used. On the other hand, when CHENO is used as coadsorbent, the decay of the dye cation is one order of magnitude slower. This effect is observed both in pure solvent and in the presence of Li+ (Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  Comparison of the transient absorption traces of RuPcA5|TiO2 (solid black line), (RuPcA5 + CHENO)|TiO2 (dotted black line), (RuPcA5 + LiClO4)|TiO2(solid gray line) and (RuPcA5 + CHENO + LiClO4)|TiO2 (dotted gray line) at 740 nm after excitation at 650 nm. Note that RuPcA5 ground state absorption at 740 nm is negligible (see Fig. 8). 
In a first analysis, the observed effects on the recombination dynamics could be attributed to the different amount of photoinjected electrons in each sample, which would lead to a different filling of the electron traps on TiO2. In the case of Li+, the electron injection yield improves dramatically, more traps will therefore be filled and electron detrapping, and consequently recombination, will become faster. When using CHENO as a coadsorbent, the amount of dye loaded into the semiconductor is much lower and, as Fig. 8B indicates, the total amount of electrons injected is also lower. The traps are therefore emptier and recombination will become slower. Against this interpretation, however, is the fact that we are working with very low excitation energies and that in all the studied samples the number of electrons injected into TiO2 should be ≤1 per nanoparticle, lower than the density of TiO2 electrons present in the dark.29 Under such conditions, we have previously shown that the recombination dynamics are independent of excitation density and dye loading.
The effect of Li+ can be explained if we consider that the electron traps in the TiO2 surface are placed at a lower energy than in pure, non-aqueous solvent and, even in the dark, they will be more populated (Boltzmann distribution). In the absence of light and a redox active electrolyte, the electrons probably originate from the core of the TiO2nanoparticles, migrating to fill lower energy states. Previous observations of the faster recombination dynamics of N719 cations with TiO2 electrons in the presence of Li+ and/or H+ have been attributed to the same reason.29,30 In addition to the higher filling of the trap states, in the presence of Li+ the driving force for recombination is smaller. Since recombination processes typically lie in the Marcus inverted region, it is to be expected that a decrease of driving force will also lead to faster dynamics.
The beneficial effect of CHENO, slowing down recombination dynamics, have never been reported before, to our knowledge. CHENO does not seem to affect the position of the semiconductor edge since, as we discussed before, the injection yield is similar with and without this coadsorbent. It seems then that the coadsorbent is mainly acting upon the dye. A plausible explanation would be that it affects the geometry of the sensitizer attached to the surface. While ideally, the ring of RuPc, where the hole is mainly localized, should be parallel to the semiconductor surface to guarantee the longest possible distance between hole and electron, it is easy to see how these big molecules could be tilted. CHENO molecules could plausibly help the dye molecules to “stand up” on the surface, increasing the distance between the semiconductor surface and the phthalocyanine ring and therefore slowing down the dye cation-electron recombination.
It is worth noting that all the RuPc dyes showed a similar trend in the recombination dynamics of the dye cations with the electrons in TiO2. This is in good agreement with the HOMO calculations which provided a similar HOMO-TiO2 surface distance for all the dyes (the HOMOs are mainly located in the phthalocyanine ring). It is well known that distance is one of the key parameters controlling dye cation and TiO2(e−) recombination.28


2.4.3 
            Dye
            regeneration by the redox couple. 
The regeneration dynamics of the radical cation of RuPcA5 was studied by flash-photolysis both in complete solar cells and in sensitized films covered with a drop of redox active electrolyte. The samples were excited at 630 nm and probed at 525 nm, the maximum of the radical cation of RuPc.31 As redox electrolytes, we used again EL1 (0.25 M LiI/I2 in propylene carbonate) and EL2 (0.25 M TBAI/I2 in propylene carbonate).
The presence of Li+, so important for the dynamics of electron injection and recombination of the RuPc cations with the TiO2 electrons, does not seem to have a significant effect upon the regeneration process. The observed dynamics at 525 nm were very similar for the two mediators used (EL1 and EL2) with half lifetimes on the order of tens of µs. This result is in apparent disagreement with a previous report from Pelet et al.32 where it was observed that, at high enough concentrations, the nature of the iodide counterion had a significant effect on the regeneration dynamics of N719. They found that the more charged the cation, the faster the regeneration (following the trend Mg2+ > Li+ > TBA+). The effect was attributed to a reversal of the TiO2nanoparticles surface charge upon adsorption of cations, leading to adsorption of I− onto the semiconductor. The authors postulated that the existence of these adsorbed iodide molecules was critical for the regeneration process. It is worth noting, though, that the studied sensitizers are very different and that the observed regeneration dynamics for RuPcA5 is more than one order of magnitude slower than for N719. This indicates that there are other factors (driving force, geometry, etc.) playing an important role in the regeneration process of RuPc and that the bottleneck of the regeneration in this case lies somewhere else than in the iodide adsorption onto the surface. Consequently, there is no contradiction between Pelet's and our results.
On the other hand, in the presence of CHENO the decay of the RuPc cation signal is accelerated by a factor of 2 (see Fig. 10) Since we know (from our previous measurements in a non-redox active electrolyte) that CHENO also slows down the recombination of the dye cations with the TiO2 electrons, it seems evident that the relative kinetics of the regeneration process compared to the competing recombination reaction is enhanced in the presence of CHENO.
 Fig. 10  Comparison of the transient absorption traces of DSSCs with/without CHENO at 525 nm (dye cation absorption maximum) after excitation at 630 nm. The measurement was taken in the dark. The IV curves of the same cells are shown in Fig. 6. 
Since the measured decay half-lifetime of the RuPcA5 cation is, even in the presence of CHENO, very large when compared to the reported values for N719 (tens of µs vs. ∼1 µs) there is the possibility that the regeneration of RuPcA5 is not optimal. When measuring the decay dynamics of the radical cation in the presence of a redox active electrolyte, two processes are being monitored at the same time (see Fig. 1): recombination of the dye cations with the TiO2 electrons and the regeneration of the dye cation by the electrolyte. To minimize efficiency losses, the recombination should be slow compared to the regeneration. A good way to estimate the contribution of the recombination process in the monitored decay is to carry out the measurement both in the dark and under white light illumination. While the regeneration process should not be affected by the presence of light, it is well known that recombination is strongly dependent on the light intensity.29 At higher intensity, a higher number of electrons are injected into and fill the semiconductor trap states; this increases the rates of electron detrapping and recombination processes. If the observed dye cation dynamics in the presence of redox electrolyte are the same in the dark and under white light illumination, this is a strong indication that the regeneration reaction is the main contributor to the observed decay. If, in contrast, the decay is accelerated in the presence of light, it is clear that a significant part of the observed decay is due to the unwanted recombination process and that regeneration is not 100% efficient. When making such a study on our samples, it was observed that even in the presence of CHENO, the decay dynamics were accelerated under 1 sun illumination. Consequently, the regeneration of the RuPc cations is not optimal.
The fact that the regeneration of RuPc is slow can be, at least partially, explained if we take into account the energetics of the process. The reaction is rather complex since it involves two I− molecules32 and it is thought to occur in two steps.33 First, fast formation (<1 µs) of a complex between a molecule of iodide and the dye cation Dye˙+ + I− → [Dye˙+,I−](1)followed by reaction of the intermediate with a second molecule of iodide, leading to the regeneration of the dye [Dye˙+,I−] + I− → Dye + I2˙−(2)This second step is thought to be at least one order of magnitude slower and the rate determining step of the overall regeneration reaction. The dynamics of this step has been found to be dependent on the driving force of the reaction. A comparison of the regeneration dynamics of several Ru(bpy)2L2 complexes where different ligands (L) were used to modulate the oxidation potential of the sensitizer showed that a decrease of 0.3 V in the driving force led to dynamics at least two order of magnitude slower and to a much lower regeneration yield.33 The oxidation potential of RuPcA5, 0.55 V vs. SCE, is significantly lower than that of 0.85Vvs.SCE for N719.3 Therefore, the slow regeneration dynamics of RuPcA5 can be well explained by the decrease of driving force for the reaction when compared to the standard N719.

2.5 Device efficiency vs. photophysics
When the device efficiency measurements and the photophysical studies are considered together a more comprehensive picture of the system appears.
The Li+ effects on device efficiency (higher photocurrent and lower photovoltage) and on the injection and recombination dynamics (faster injection and recombination) are well correlated. The presence of the small cations pulls down the CB edge of TiO2, increasing both the density of acceptor states available for injection and the number of electrons available for recombination.
The interpretation of the CHENO effect is less straightforward and somewhat unexpected. The increase in photocurrent appears not to be due to a rise in the injection yield. The axial ligands of the RuPc dyes used sufficiently hinder the formation of aggregates such that the injection yield is the same in the presence or absence of CHENO. The observed slower dye cation-TiO2 (e−) recombination and more efficient regeneration in the presence of CHENO seem then to be the reason for the increase in photocurrent. Supporting this interpretation are several additional observations on the device performance. First, there are no signs that the presence of CHENO shifts the CB edge. Dark current measurements do not indicate a shift in the CB edge and the modest increase in photovoltage observed in the presence of CHENO (about 40 mV, see Table 1), can be well explained by the increase in photocurrent (larger by a factor of 2.3). This is consistent with the facts that the injection yield is not affected by CHENO and that both CHENO and the RuPc dyes bring one proton to the environment. Moreover, a recent literature report showing photovoltage vs. electron density measurements further supports the idea that addition of CHENO does not shift the CB edge when the “replaced” dye only provides one proton to the environment.34 Second, measurements of recombination to the electrolyte (data not shown) vs voltage do not indicate any change in the recombination of the TiO2 electrons with I3− in the presence of CHENO.
There is not a straightforward reason why CHENO slows down dye cation recombination and accelerates the regeneration. A tentative explanation is that the presence of CHENO modifies the orientation of the dye on the semiconductor surface increasing the hole-electron distance. The dye molecules, which are rather big, would not be tilted, but “standing up” on the surface. This geometry could also be the reason for the more efficient dye regeneration. As we discussed above, the regeneration process most probably implies the formation of a complex with two iodide molecules. If the dye is “standing up” on the surface it will be more accessible to the approach of the iodides than in a tilted geometry.

Synthesis of the RuPcA2–6dyes. 
A solution of RuPc(benzonitrile)222 (40 mg, 0.04 mmol), pyridine b–f (0.04 mmol) and isonicotinic acid (0.12 mmol) in dry THF was refluxed for 3 h. The solvent was evaporated and the crude mixture purified by column chromatography (SiO2) using dichloromethane/methanol (15:1) as eluent. The first eluted blue fraction was identified as the axially symmetrically substituted RuPcS2–6, and the second as the desired unsymmetrically substituted compounds RuPcA2–6. Increasing the eluent polarity to dichloromethane/methanol (10:1) allowed elution of the symmetrically substituted RuPcA1. After removal of the solvent under vacuum these compounds were obtained as dark blue solids.

3.2 
          Cyclic voltammetry

Measurements were done by cyclic voltammetry in a conventional three-electrode cell connected to a CH Instruments 660c potentiostat-galvanostat. We used tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as electrolyte, a platinum working electrode, a calomel reference electrode (SCE) and a platinum wire as auxiliary electrode. The 1 × 10−3 M solutions in CH2Cl2, except RuPcA1 which was measured in DMSO, were purged with Ar during 5 minutes prior to measurements.
3.3 Steady-state emission
The dye fluorescence emission properties, either in solution or adsorbed onto metal oxide films, were measured under ambient conditions using an Aminco Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer equipped with a temperature controller and a holder for films and solid samples. The excitation wavelength corresponded to the Q band maximum measured by absorbance spectroscopy.
3.4 DSSC

3.4.1 Solar cell preparation. 

Dye-sensitized TiO2cells were made with standard techniques.35 TiO2 particles were synthesized from Ti-isopropoxide following the nitric acid/acetic acid route, followed by autoclaving.36 Layers of the TiO2 particles (∼4 µm) were deposited by doctor blading on FTO glass. The layers were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. An additional TiCl4 treatment was applied.37 The resultant films were reheated at 450 °C, cooled to about 100 °C and placed into the dye solution (2 × 10−5 M in CH2Cl2) overnight. To study the effect of CHENO, dye solutions were also prepared containing this coadsorbent (5 × 10−5 M). The cell geometry was 1 × 1 cm. Two different electrolytes were used (see Table 1), EL1 and EL2. EL1 was a Li+ based electrolyte, 0.25 M LiI/I2 in propylene carbonate, while in EL2, the Li+ was replaced by a large cation, tetrabutylammonium (TBA).


3.4.2 IV measurement setup. 
Current vs voltage data were collected using a simulated AM1.5 spectrum with an integrated intensity of 83 mW/cm2. The simulator was cross checked with two outside laboratories (ECN and EPFL).

3.5 Flash-photolysis

3.5.1 Samples. 
We carried out the measurements on both dye sensitized films covered by electrolyte and complete DSSCs. The method to prepare the TiO2 films and the sensitization procedure was in both cases the same (see description above). When not working with complete solar cells, a drop of electrolyte was poured on the sensitized film surface. The film was covered with a thin glass cover slide adhered to the film surface by capillarity.


3.5.2 Setup. 
Transient absorption decays were measured using the “flash-photolysis” technique. The sample was excited with a dye laser (Photon Technology International Inc., GL-301) pumped by a nitrogen laser (Photon Technology International Inc., GL-3300). The excitation wavelength was 630 or 650 nm, the pulse width was 800 ps, the fluence was about 50 µJcm−2 and the repetition frequency was 1 Hz. A 100 W tungsten-halogen lamp (Bentham, IL1) with a stabilized power supply (Bentham, 605) was used as a probe light source. The probe light passing through the sample was detected with a silicon photodiode (Hamamatsu Photonics, S1722-01). The signal from the photodiode was pre-amplified and sent to the main amplification system with an electronic band-pass filter to improve signal to noise ratio (Costronics Electronics). The amplified signal was collected with a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix, TDS 220), which was synchronized with a trigger signal of the laser pulse from a photodiode (Thorlabs Inc., DET210). To reduce stray light, scattered light and emission from the sample, two monochromators and appropriate optical cut-off filters were placed before and after the sample. Owing to the amplification and noise reduction system, the detectable change of absorbance was as small as 10−5 to 10−6.
All the measurements with inert electrolytes were carried out in the dark. Measurements in the presence of redox active electrolyte were carried out both in the dark and under 0.25 or 1 sun illumination.

3.6 Calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the program Gaussian 03.38 The DFT calculations employed Becke's three parameter (B3) hybrid functional with (LYP) correlation functional (B3LYP). The electronic structures of the complexes were determined using a general basis set with 6-31G(d) for nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon atoms, 6-31G for hydrogen atoms, and an effective core potential basis set LANL2DZ for the ruthenium atoms.
4 Conclusion
Obtaining efficient red sensitizers is essential to the optimization of DSSCs. Phthalocyanines are especially attractive candidates because of their high absorption coefficients, but even the state-of-the-art phthalocyanine sensitized solar cells give relatively poor efficiencies when compared to the standard N719 (3.5% vs 11%).39 Understanding the reason for their low efficiency and how to improve it is a necessary step in the development of red sensitizers.
A detailed study of the photophysics and device performance of a series of novel Ru-phthalocyanines has been presented here. The dyes are not efficient sensitizers, but they have proved to be useful to study the effect of two very common additives: Li+ and CHENO.
The effect of Li+ correlates well with previous studies. The addition of Li+ shifts down the conduction band edge, leading to a higher electron injection yield and to higher photocurrent in the device. The downside is the faster recombination of the dye cations with the electrons in the conduction band and the lower photovoltages obtained in the devices. In spite of this, it is clear that Li+ is necessary for the cells. The injecting state is an energetically low-lying triplet and the addition of Li+ raises the observed photocurrent and injection yield dramatically.
Especially interesting is the effect of CHENO. It is well known that CHENO often enhances the photocurrent of solar cells sensitized with organic dyes such as coumarins, porphyrins and phthalocyanines. The photocurrent rise is usually attributed to an increment in the electron injection yield due to the effect of CHENO hindering the formation of dye aggregates. CHENO dramatically enhances the efficiency of Ru-phthalocyanine sensitized solar cells, doubling JSC without decreasing VOC. However, unlike previous studies, the Ru-phthalocyanines studied here have been developed to minimize the formation of aggregates: in this case the photocurrent increase is found not to be due to a higher injection yield. Photophysical measurements point to the slower recombination of dye cations with the TiO2 electrons and faster regeneration of the dye cations by the electrolyte as the reasons for the enhanced photocurrent. These results suggest that the effect of CHENO on DSSCs is more complex (and more beneficial) than what was previously assumed. They also highlight the necessity of carrying out both photophysics and device performance measurements to obtain a comprehensive understanding of DSSCs.

It is interesting to notice that some of the studied samples presented quite complex and unexpected dynamics. Following the usual decay of the dye cation signal, a rise and a decay (a “bump”) appeared at very long timescales, typically hundreds of ms. At these timescales, both recombination and regeneration processes should be over. This “bump” was wavelength dependent, being rather small at 525 nm, but much more visible at 725 nm. Investigation is under way to find out the origin of this strange dynamics and why it is not present in all the samples.
