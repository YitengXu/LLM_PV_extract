A sturdy junction at the interface can be provided by modifying the electronic structure of the TiO2 electrode with Nb doping. The Nb-doped TiO2 was prepared by a sol–gel method followed by a hydrothermal treatment; the Nb content was varied from 0.5 to 3.0 mol%. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the Fermi level of TiO2 electrode shifted away from the conduction band minimum (CBM) when the Nb content is low (≤1.5 mol%) and shifted toward the CBM when the Nb content is high (≥2.5 mol%). The shift of Fermi level with low Nb doping was due to the passivation of the oxygen vacancies at the TiO2 nanoparticle surface. Intraband states were formed when dopant content was 1.5 and 2.5 mol%. We have found that the photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs based on doped TiO2 sensitized with a cis-[Ru(dcbpyH)2(NCS)2](NBu4)2, N719 dye, are closely related to the electronic structure of the Nb-doped TiO2 electrode. The changes of short circuit current and open circuit voltage of DSSCs were explained in relation to the electronic structure of the TiO2 electrode. The best efficiency of 8.0% was demonstrated by DSSCs with 2.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2.

Broader context
The solar irradiation can be directly transformed into the electric power using photovoltaic solar cells. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on mesoscopic TiO2 layers are promising photovoltaic systems for large-scale commercialization. However, the energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs is not sufficient and needs to be improved. Our study demonstrates an effective way to increase the efficiency of DSSCs by doping of TiO2 mesoscopic layers with niobium (Nb). We have investigated how the low level doping changes the crystal and electronic structure of a TiO2 electrode. We have shown that the doping plays a beneficial role on the electron transport in DSSCs by tailoring the electronic structure of the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface. By varying the Nb-doping content we have found the optima doping level for gaining the best energy conversion characteristics of DSSCs.

1. Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on a nanocrystalline titanium dioxide (TiO2) layer as a working electrode have reached an efficiency level of 11.3%.1 Although there were drastic efficiency improvements of DSSCs in the 1990s,2 the efficiency progress was very slow in the last decade. For the continuous improvement in the cell efficiency, fundamental understanding of the junction characteristics at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface is necessary. For this purpose, TiO2 can be n-type doped to enhance charge collection and electron transport.
Several laboratories have examined TiO2 films doped with niobium (Nb) up to a doping level of 20 mol%.3–7 Metal-like behavior was observed for highly Nb-doped anatase TiO2.3 However, such heavy doping is unfavorable for electrochemical applications due to the increased electron recombination at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface.8 To date, only a few studies have investigated how the performance of DSSCs can be improved with doping.5,9Lu and co-workers showed an increase in the photocurrent of DSSCs fabricated with highly doped (from 2.5 to 10 mol% Nb) TiO2 electrode.5 However, the effect of low Nb doping on the electronic structure of a nanocrystalline TiO2 is not yet fully understood. A systematic study is needed to clarify low Nb doping effect on the electronic structure of the nanocrystalline TiO2 and its impact on the performance of photovoltaic devices.
In this study TiO2 was doped with Nb in the range of 0.5 to 3.0 mol% to control the junction characteristics and enhance the charge transport. The electronic structures of the Nb-doped TiO2 such as positions of Fermi energy level (EF) and intraband defect states were systematically investigated using photoemission spectroscopy to explain the photovoltaic behavior of DSSCs fabricated with the doped TiO2 electrode.
2. Experiments
The undoped TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized following the procedure described by Ito et al.10 The Nb-doped TiO2 was obtained by a co-hydrolysis of Ti and Nb precursors. Similar method of synthesis was described elsewhere.6,9 To prepare undoped TiO2 nanoparticles the amount of 2.64 ml of acetic acid was added to 16.4 ml of titanium isopropoxide (TTIP, 99.999%, Aldrich) and the mixture was stirred with a Teflon stir blade for 15 min at room temperature. To prepare doped TiO2 nanoparticles with the Nb concentrations of 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.0 mol%, 16.4 ml of TTIP was mixed with 0.20, 60, 100, and 120 µl of niobium ethoxide (NbEth, 99.999%, Aldrich), respectively, and the acetic acid was added. The mixture of TTIP, NbEth, and acetic acid was dropped into 68.4 ml of deionized (DI) water under a stirring condition of about 800 rpm. Approximately 1 h stirring is needed to complete the hydrolysis reaction. Then 2.35 ml of 65% nitric acid was added into the solution. The solution temperature was increased to 80 °C in 40 min and held constant for 80 min under a refluxing condition with intensive stirring. DI water was added to the flask to maintain a solution volume of 81 ml. The nanoparticles were grown hydrothermally using the prepared colloidal solution in a 125 ml Teflon-lined mini-autoclave at 250 °C for 12 h. After completing the nanoparticle growth, 0.52 ml of 65% nitric acid was added to the colloidal solution followed by treatment with ultrasonic stirring for 15 min. Finally, the prepared mixture was washed three times with ethanol by centrifugation.
The details of the electrode fabrication and DSSC assembling are described elsewhere.10 A fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (Solaronix, 8 Ω □−1) was sequentially cleaned in acetone, in 0.1 M HCl ethanolic solution, in Triton X-100 aqueous solution, in water, and in ethanol. After cleaning, the FTO glass was treated with a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min to deposit a compact TiO2 barrier layer. Then a TiO2 paste was coated on the FTO glass by a doctor-blade method. The paste was prepared by mixingTiO2 nanoparticles with terpineol and ethyl cellulose ethanol solution. Finally, the film was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The thickness of the TiO2 films was measured to be around 10 µm.
For the dye coating, the working electrodes were dipped in a 0.3 mM of cis-[Ru(dcbpyH)2(NCS)2](NBu4)2 (N719) dye solution in a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (1:1 volume ratio) for 24 h. After the sensitizer uptake, the TiO2 electrodes were washed with ethanol. A platinum-coated FTO glass was used as a counter electrode. The counter and working electrodes were assembled into the sandwich-type cell and sealed with ionomer film (Surlyn 1702). The commercially available electrolyte AN-50 (Solaronix) was used. The active area of the cells was varied from 0.14 to 0.18 cm2.
Characterization
The Nb content in the samples was determined with the aid of an inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscope (Hewlett-Packard 4500). The thickness of the film was measured with a Tencor Alpha Step 500 surface profile system. The crystal structure was investigated with a Rigaku D/MAX-IIIC powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The shape and size of the particles were estimated using Tecnai G2 F30 field-emission transmission electron microscope (TEM). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping analysis was performed using scanning TEM (STEM) JEM-2100F HR (JEOL). The samples were treated using plasma cleaner. The absorption spectra were measured by a Shimadzu UV-310 double-beam spectrometer equipped with an integrated sphere. For the absorption measurements, the TiO2 colloidal solutions were prepared by dispersing 1 g of TiO2 nanoparticles in 1 L of DI water (pH = 3, adjusted with HCl).
The electronic structure and chemical state of the TiO2 electrodes were investigated by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), using Sigma Probe (VG Scientific) with Al Kα (1486.65 eV) X-ray radiation under a base pressure of 10−10 Torr. The binding energies were calibrated with a reference to C 1s peak at 284.60 eV. For the XPS measurements, the undoped and doped TiO2 were deposited on silicon substrates and sintered at 450 °C for 1 h. The samples were installed in the analysis chamber on a conductive substrate to share the common EF. The instrument resolution was 47 meV.
The photovoltaic properties of DSSCs were measured by recording current–voltage characteristics under illumination with a Spectra Physics Oriel 300W Solar Simulator with an AM1.5G filter set. The integrated intensity was set to be 100 mW cm−2 with a thermopile radiant power meter (Spectra Physics Oriel, model 70260) with fused silica window and was controlled to be constant throughout the measurements by means of a digital exposure controller (Spectra Physics Oriel, model 68950).
3. Results and discussion
The Nb content in the TiO2 nanoparticles was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. The quantitative results, listed in Table 1, agree well with the doping level expected from the synthesis procedure. The presence of Nb atoms in 3.0 mol% Nb doped TiO2 structure was observed using elemental mapping analysis. Fig. 1a shows the STEM image of TiO2 nanoparticles and the elemental mapping for Ti and Nb atoms is shown in Fig. 1b and c, respectively. The homogeneous distribution of dopant atoms within the sample is clearly visible (Fig. 1c).

Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of undoped and Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. Anatase and rutile phases of TiO2 are distinct. As the Nb content increases the peak intensity of anatase phase increases and that of rutile phase decreases. Thus the presence of Nb atoms appears to enhance the growth of the anatase phase TiO2 and hinders the formation of the rutile phase TiO2. A similar effect of different oxide additives on the TiO2 phase transformation was reported by Yanagida et al.11

Fig. 3 shows TEM images of the undoped and doped TiO2 nanoparticles. The undoped and doped with Nb content of 0.5–1.5 mol% samples have both rhombic-shaped anatase particles with a diameter of 10 to 35 nm and rod-like rutile particles with a diameter of 10 to 30 nm and length of 50 to 300 nm (Fig. 3a–c). A TEM image of the TiO2 doped with 2.5 and 3.0 mol% Nb shows only anatase particles (Fig. 3d and e).

The optical absorption coefficient, α, was determined from the measurements of the absorption spectra of colloidal TiO2 nanoparticles with the following equation: α = 2.303·103Aρ/lc,(1)where A is the sample absorption, ρ the TiO2 density (3.84 g cm−3), c the loading of the colloid in grams per litre, and l the optical path length.12 For the indirect semiconductor, like TiO2, the expected variation in the absorption coefficient with the photon energy, hν, near the absorption edge can be expressed as follows: α(hν) = Bi·(hν − Eg)2/hν,(2)where Bi is the absorption constant for an indirect transition and Eg is the optical bandgap.13 The bandgap determination from the experimental absorption coefficients is shown in Fig. 4. Plot of (αhν)1/2versushν gives two straight line segments with two intercepts on the energy axis, hν1 and hν2. The Eg values can be estimated as follows: Eg=½(hν1+ hν2).(3)

The (αhν)1/2 plot gives two straight line segments with two intercepts, hν1 and hν2 on the energy axis. The Eg value can be estimated as the centre between these two intercepts. 
The calculated Eg values are listed in Table 2. The Eg value increases from 3.05 to 3.18 eV as the Nb content increases from 0 to 3.0 mol%. The bandgap widening with increase in the Nb content can be explained by decrease in rutile phase (Fig. 2). Indeed, the bandgap of anatase, 3.2 eV, is large than that of rutile, 3.0 eV.

The Voc is highest for the DSSCs fabricated with 0.5 mol% doped TiO2. The value continuously decreases with further increase in the Nb content. We will see below that the low doping (0.5 and 1.5 mol%) decreases the concentration of the oxygen vacancies at the TiO2 surface. Such behavior leads to the widening of the space charge region which suppresses the recombination at the TiO2–electrolyte interface. High doping (≥2.5 mol%) causes an opposite behavior.
The Jsc value increases from 12.52 to 16.53 mA cm−2 as the Nb content increases from 0 to 3.0 mol%. Note that the Jsc of DSSCs with 3.0 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 is about 32% higher than that of the DSSCs with undoped TiO2. The effect of the doping on the photovoltaic parameters is closely related to the alteration of the electronic structure of the TiO2 electrode. XPS analysis was provided to examine the electronic structure of the undoped and Nb-doped TiO2 electrodes.

Fig. 6 shows a valence band photoemission spectrum of the undoped TiO2 and its Gaussian fit. The binding energy scale is referenced to the EF. Two peaks are distinguished in the photoemission spectrum: one centered at 5.4 eV and another centered at 7.8 eV. These peaks are attributed to the electron emission from π (nonbonding) and σ (bonding) O 2p orbitals, respectively. Sanjines et al. revealed similar peaks in TiO2 anatase polycrystalline film.14 The position of the valence band maximum (VBM) was directly determined from the electron emission spectrum by means of a linear extrapolation of the onset of the valence band emission. The VBM was found to be located at about 2.9 eV below the EF. With an estimated optical bandgap of around 3.05 eV, we can deduce that the EF is located at 0.15 eV below the conduction band minimum (CBM).

The VBM values of the TiO2 doped with 0.5 and 1.5 mol% Nb are located at 2.8 eV (Fig. 7a and b) and those of TiO2 with 2.5 and 3.0 mol% Nb are 3.0 and 3.1 eV, respectively (Fig. 7c and d). The positions of the CBM with respect to EF were calculated using the results of the optical spectroscopy and XPS analysis and summarized in Table 4. It should be noted that the shift of the EF with respect to the conduction band edge points out the change of free electron density, no, in Nb-doped TiO2.

The results of valence band analysis are confirmed by the XPS spectra in the regions of Ti 2p and O 1s subshell emissions, which were taken for different Nb doping levels (Fig S1†, ESI). The observed shifts of core-level peaks to lower binding energy for the samples doped with 2.5 and 3.0 mol% Nb can be attributed to the increase in free electron concentration.20 The shifts to higher binding energy for the samples with 0.5 and 1.5 mol% Nb indicate the opposite behavior.
The effect of Nb doping on the photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs can be understood from the CBM change. The alignment of the CBM of TiO2 and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of N719 dye is important for charge injection at the TiO2–dye interface.
The CBM positions of TiO2 doped with 2.5 and 3.0 mol% Nb with respect to EF are about 0.12 and 0.08 eV, respectively, while that of undoped TiO2 is about 0.15 eV (Table 4). Therefore the CBM positions for these samples are lower by about 0.03 and 0.07 eV in comparison to that of undoped TiO2 (Table 4). It should be noted that the offset between the CBM of undoped TiO2 and the LUMO level of N719 dye is around 0.05 eV.15 The observed shift in the CBM position may enhance the electron injection from the dye to the conduction band of TiO2. In addition, the higher conductivity of Nb-doped TiO2 can improve electron transport through the electrode.3,5
Note that the Jsc value of the cell with 1.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 is much higher than that of the cell with 0.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 (Table 3), even though the CBM positions for both samples are the same. We found that the doping level of 1.5 and 2.5 mol% Nb induces the appearance of intraband surface states (Fig. 7b and c). These intraband states might assist the electron injection and charge transport. Indeed, various models of electron transport based on the intermediacy of localized surface states were developed.16,17 Thus, based on our experimental results we can conclude that the Nb doping modifies the electronic structure of TiO2 and significantly increases the Jsc of the DSSCs.
We found that the energy difference between CBM and EF in the TiO2 doped with 0.5 and 1.5 mol% Nb is larger than that in the undoped TiO2 (Table 4). It is an unexpected result because Nb is supposed to be a donor impurity that can shift the EF toward CBM. The phenomenon can be explained as following. The substitution of Ti by Nb at the surface site can passivate the oxygen vacancy because Nb attracts additional oxygen. The attracted oxygen atoms have dangling bonds which neutralize the donor defects induced by substitution of Ti by Nb. As a result, the oxygen vacancy concentration is decreased with the Nb substitution at the surface, enlarging the space charge region at the TiO2–electrolyte interface.
Our suggestion is supported by the XPS data. Indeed, we found that, in contrast to the undoped sample (Fig. 6), Nb doping causes an increase in the emission intensity of nonbonding O 2p orbitals. It should be noted that the intensity of this emission reaches the maximum level for the sample doped with 0.5 mol% Nb (Fig. 7a). Table 5 summarizes the ratios of the emission intensity of the π and σ O 2p orbitals for undoped and doped samples. The similar results were reported by Carlsson et al. for Bi doped ZnO when the redistribution of the dopant atoms in the surface region leads to the oxygen-excess defects formation.18

Note that the Voc of the DSSCs with 0.5 and 1.5 mol% of Nb-doped TiO2 was higher than that of the DSSCs with undoped TiO2 (Table 4). This can be explained from the decrease of no value induced by the reduction of oxygen vacancy concentration at the TiO2 surface. The decrease of no causes the widening of the space charge region in TiO2, forming a sturdy junction at the TiO2–electrolyte interface.19 The Voc values of the DSSCs based on 2.5 and 3.0 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 were lower than that in the DSSCs based on undoped TiO2. This is due to the increase of no value, which results in the narrowing of space charge region in the TiO2 and causes additional recombination in the junction region.8,19

        Lu
        et al. reported the fabrication of DSSCs based on TiO2 doped with Nb concentration up to 10 mol% where they observed the energy conversion efficiency of 7.6% and 7.8% for the Nb concentration of 2.5 and 5.0 mol%, respectively.5 However, our results demonstrate that the increase of Nb-doping level over 2.5 mol% produces the degradation of Voc parameter leading to the decrease in device efficiency. Taking into consideration the behavior of Jsc with doping we can conclude that the optimum Nb concentration for reaching the highest efficiency ranges between 1.5 and 2.5 mol%.
4. Conclusion
Based on the above experimental results, we can conclude that the Nb doping significantly affects the electronic structure of the TiO2 electrode. The EF of the Nb-doped TiO2 was lower than that of the undoped TiO2 when the Nb content was in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 mol% and higher when the dopant content was 2.5 mol% and more. The Nb doping in the range of 1.5–2.5 mol% was found to induce the formation of the intraband states. For the samples with the Nb content of 2.5 and 3.0 mol% the CBM was lowed; it enhances the electron injection from dye to TiO2 conduction band.
The increase in the Jsc of the DSSCs with 1.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 compared to DSSCs with 0.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 is due to the charge transport improvements induced by the formation of intraband states. The increase in the Jsc of the DSSCs with 2.5 and 3.0 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 compared to the DSSCs with 1.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 is due to charge injection improvements induced by the CBM lowering. The Voc increase with Nb content (≤1.5 mol%) is caused by the extension of the space charge region in the TiO2 due to the decrease of oxygen vacancy concentration at the TiO2 surface. The Voc decrease with high Nb content (≥2.5 mol%) is caused by the narrowing of the space charge region resulting in the increase of recombination at the TiO2–dye interface.
The best cell efficiency of 8.0% was obtained for DSSCs with the 2.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2. We have shown that the Nb doping of TiO2 electrodes in DSSCs can improve the charge injection and transport by tailoring the electronic structure of the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface.

The solar irradiation can be directly transformed into the electric power using photovoltaic solar cells. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on mesoscopic TiO2 layers are promising photovoltaic systems for large-scale commercialization. However, the energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs is not sufficient and needs to be improved. Our study demonstrates an effective way to increase the efficiency of DSSCs by doping of TiO2 mesoscopic layers with niobium (Nb). We have investigated how the low level doping changes the crystal and electronic structure of a TiO2 electrode. We have shown that the doping plays a beneficial role on the electron transport in DSSCs by tailoring the electronic structure of the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface. By varying the Nb-doping content we have found the optima doping level for gaining the best energy conversion characteristics of DSSCs.
