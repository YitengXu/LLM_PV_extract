    , Accepted 19th April 2020First published on 20th April 2020AbstractVertical stacking of two-dimensional materials into layered van der Waals heterostructures has recently been considered as a promising candidate for photocatalytic and optoelectronic devices because it can combine the advantages of the individual 2D materials. Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (JTMDCs) have emerged as an appealing photocatalytic material due to the desirable electronic properties. Hence, in this work, we systematically investigate the geometric features, electronic properties, charge density difference, work function, band alignment and photocatalytic properties of ZnO–JTMDC heterostructures using first-principles calculations. Due to the different kinds of chalcogen atoms on both sides of JTMDC monolayers, two different possible stacking patterns of ZnO–JTMDC heterostructures have been constructed and considered. We find that all these stacking patterns of ZnO–JTMDC heterostructures are dynamically and energetically feasible. Moreover, both ZnO–MoSSe and ZnO–WSSe heterostructures are indirect band gap semiconductors and present type-I and type-II band alignments for model-I and model-II, respectively. The Rashba spin polarization of the ZnO–WSSe heterostructure for model-I is greater than that in the others. Furthermore, valence (conduction) band edge potentials are calculated to understand the photocatalytic behavior of these systems. Energetically favorable band edge positions in ZnO–Janus heterostructures make them suitable for water splitting at zero pH. We found that the ZnO–Janus heterostructures are promising candidates for water splitting with conduction and valence band edges positioned just outside of the redox interval.
1 Introduction
Hydrogen is known to be a pollution-free fuel in fuel cell technology; however, the process of hydrogen production is so not clean and pollution free.1–5 Recently, photocatalytic water splitting has emerged as an alternative way to produce hydrogen, where semiconducting materials with desired valence and conduction band energy are considered as potential candidates for the conversion of solar light into hydrogen.6–9 The overall water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen gases is achieved since shining light on the semiconductor generates electrons (holes) in the conduction (valence) band to reduce (oxidize) water molecules.10,11 In addition, one of the most important requirements for a semiconductor which is suitable for photocaltalytic water splitting reactions is the positions of its band edges. In other words, the conduction band should be higher than the redox potential of H+/H2 (0 eV), while the valence band should be smaller that the redox potential of O2/H20 (1.23 eV). This shows that the band gap value of the desired semiconductors should be larger than 1.23 eV.
To date, two-dimensional (2D) materials have widely emerged due to their wide range of applications in catalysis,12 electrochemical energy storage,13,14 photocatalysis,15 electronics,16,17 optoelectronics,18,19 spintronics20–22 and photonic nanodevices.23 Among these, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have received considerable interest because of their fascinating properties.24 However, TMDC monolayers show some disadvantages, such as large effective masses, weak dielectric screening, and strong excitonic effects,25 leading to a fast rate of the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The short lifetime of electron–hole pairs leads to an extremely low quantum efficiency, and thus the device's performance is dramatically impeded. In order to break this limitation in 2D TMDCs, many common strategies have been developed, such as applying electric fields,26 strain engineering,27 layer stacking28,29 and controlling their composition.30 Among these, stacking different 2D materials into layered vdW heterostructures is considered as a practical way to design next-generation applications, ranging from nanoelectronics to optoelectronics and photonics, such as tunneling transistors,31 solar cells32 and bipolar transistors.33 Especially, the formation of type-II band alignment in layered vdW heterostructures is capable of modulating the interlayer transition energy and is responsible for charge separation, and is hence intensively used in designing advanced optoelectronic devices.
Recently, polar Janus TMDC MXY (M = Mo, W; X/Y = S, Se, Te) monolayers have been obtained in experiments either by a sulfurization strategy of monolayer MoSe2 or a selenization one of monolayer MoS2.34 One can observe that the large Rashba spin splitting, originating from the atomic radius and electronegativity differences of the X and Y chalcogen elements in Janus TMDCs MXY, makes them promising for futuristic spintronic devices. For instance, Xia et al.35 from first-principles calculations investigated the electronic and photocatalytic features of different kinds of Janus TMDCs MXY and demonstrated that they are promising candidates for highly efficient photocatalysts. At the same time, the sp2 graphene-like ZnO monolayer is gaining enormous interest from both theoretical and experimental scientific communities.36 The fascinating physical and chemical properties of the ZnO monolayer, such as the chemical bonding and large exciton binding energy, make it a fascinating material for transparent electronics, solar cells and gas sensors.37
vdW heterostructures between Janus TMDCs MXY and other 2D materials, such as MXY–GeC,38 MXY–graphene,39,40 and MXY–GaN,41,42 have been constructed and considered as a powerful strategy to enhance the electronic and photocatalytic features of 2D materials. For instance, Din et al.38 designed MSSe–GeC (M = Mo, W) heterostructures and investigated their electronic and photocatalytic properties. They also predicted that these vdW heterostructures can be used for designing next-generation electronic devices and photocatalytic water splitting. Yin et al. studied the effect of strain on the photocatalytic properties of Janus MoSSe/nitride heterostructures.42 Xu et al. investigated Janus MoSSe/GaN vdW heterobilayers for the band alignment transition and optical properties.41 Cavalcante et al. studied the plasmons in Janus MoSSe–graphene based van der Waals heterostructures,40 whereas by first principles calculations Pham et al. investigated the electronic properties and Schottky barrier in vertically stacked graphene/Janus MoSeS heterostructures under electric fields.39 However, to our best knowledge, the electronic properties and photocatalytic performance of vdW heterostructures between ZnO and Janus MSSe (M = Mo, W) have not been previously investigated. Based on the above interesting phenomena, it is extremely interesting to check whether the vdW heterostructures based on ZnO and Janus TMDCs MXY could be considered as promising candidates for photocatalytic and optoelectronic devices. Therefore, in this work, using first principles calculations, we have systematically investigated the stabilities, electronic structures, induced SOC Rashba spin splitting, interlayer charge transfer, work function and photocatalytic performance of these heterostructures.
2 Computational details
All our calculations are based on density functional theory (DFT)43 in conjunction with the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) potential as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).44,45 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA)46 with the approach of Grimme (DFT-D2)47 is adopted to correct the weak van der Waals like interaction. The cutoff energy for the plane wave basis set is 500 eV, and the first Brillouin zone is sampled with a Monkhorst–Pack grid of 12 × 12 × 1. All atomic positions were fully relaxed until the force is less than 0.01 eV Å−1 and the criterion for the total energy conversion is set to 10−5 eV. A vacuum space of 25 Å along the z direction is used to decouple possible periodic interactions. Since the PBE functional and GGA approach usually underestimate the band gaps of semiconductors,40 the screened hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) functional48 has been employed to get accurate electronic structures.
The effect of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is significant for Janus monolayers and hence is taken into account in all calculations, incorporated by a second variational method,56 which uses a scalar-relativistic basis, based on the reduction of the original basis. In the variational method, the scalar relativistic part of the Hamiltonian is diagonalized in the scalar relativistic basis and the calculated eigen functions are then used to construct the full Hamiltonian matrix including SOC and may be written as: ψ = εψ + Hψ, where Hψ represents the spin–orbit Hamiltonian.

Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD)49 are used to investigate the thermal stabilities of the ZnO–Janus van der Waals heterostructures. AIMD simulations are performed through the Nose-Hoover thermostat algorithm at a temperature of 300 K for a total of 6 ps with a time interval of 1 fs.
3 Results and discussion
We first check the optimized lattice constant and bond-length values for ZnO and Janus TMDCs, as listed in Table 1. These results are in good agreement with previous reports,50,51 indicating the reliability of our calculation method. The ZnO, MoSSe and WSSe monolayers are direct band gap semiconductors with band gap values of 2.06 eV, 2.07 eV and 3.10 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 1. We can find from Table 1 that Janus MXY and ZnO monolayers have the same lattice constants, resulting in a small lattice mismatch of the ZnO–Janus MXY heterostructures. The lattice mismatch in ZnO–MoSSe and ZnO–WSSe is 0.9% and 0.6%, respectively, demonstrating the they can be easily fabricated for practical applications. The atomic structures of the ZnO–Janus MXY heterostructures are depicted in Fig. 1(a and b). Based on different chalcogen atoms in the Janus monolayer two modeled heterostructures each with six favorable high-symmetry stacking sequences of atoms are investigated (see ref. 50 for details). The top and side views of the most favorable and stable stacking are plotted, in which the Mo(W) atom is on the top of the Zn atom while S, Se and O are on the hexagonal side for both models. Herein, h stands for the interlayer distance between ZnO and Janus MXY monolayers in the corresponding heterostructures. Due to different kinds of chalcogen atoms on both sides of the Janus MSSe monolayer, there are two stacking models of ZnO–Janus MSSe heterostructures, namely model-I and model-II, which represent the ZnO–SMSe and ZnO–SeMS heterostructures, respectively.

The binding energy is also calculated in order to check the structural stability and to find the most stable stacking configurations for both model-I and model-II as follows: Eb = Etotal − EZnO − EJMXY, where Etotal, EZnO, and EJMXY represent the energy of the whole system, and the ZnO and Janus MXY monolayers, respectively. The results of the binding energies in all stacking configurations of the ZnO–Janus MXY heterostructures are listed in Table 2. We can find that the ZnO–Janus MXY heterostructures for their different stacking configurations are energetically favorable and thus they can be easily fabricated in experiments for practical production. One can also find from Table 2 that all these heterostructures are characterized by weak vdW interactions dominating between ZnO and Janus MXY monoalyers. Moreover, it is clear that a smaller value of the binding energy means stronger interface binding and therefore a more stable system. The configuration of the shortest interlayer distance in Fig. 2 and the more negative value of the binding energy than the others is chosen for our work in both models, as listed in Table 2.

Moreover, it is clear that the thermal stability is an important indicator for the performance assessment of supported 2D materials. Therefore, we further perform ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to check the structural distortion and stability of the ZnO–MoSSe and ZnO–WSSe heterostructures. We can see from Fig. 2 that the ZnO–MoSSe and ZnO–WSSe heterostructures retain their geometries without any structural distortion after 6 ps. These systems show small variations in the total energies of the ZnO–Janus MXY vdW heterostructures, which are thermally stable at room temperature (300 K).
The band structures of the model-I ZnO–Janus MXY heterostructures obtained from PBE, HSE06 and PBE–SOC are depicted in Fig. 3. Our results show that the model-I ZnO–MoSSe and ZnO–WSSe vdW heterostructures without the SOC effect are indirect band gap semiconductors with the VBM at the Γ-point and the CBM at the K-point, as shown in Fig. 3(a and b) and (d and e). The band gap values of the ZnO–MoSSe and ZnO–WSSe vdW heterostructures given by PBE/HSE, respectively, are 1.40 eV/2.0 eV and 1.53 eV/2.1 eV, as listed in Table 2. Interestingly, including the SOC effect in the PBE calculations shifts the CBM from the K-point to the Γ–K-point and splits the band structure of the ZnO–MoSSe and ZnO–WSSe vdW heterostructures. Band spin splitting and Rashba spin splitting are also observed in the band structure of both the ZnO–MoSSe and ZnO–WSSe vdW heterostructures. Compared with the PBE calculation, the PBE–SOC band gap values of the ZnO–MoSSe and ZnO–WSSe vdW heterostructures decrease to 1.38 eV and 1.31 eV, respectively. As is clear from Table 1, the band gaps are larger in the HSE06 method as compared to PBE and PBE + SOC. The traditional PBE method is known to underestimate the band gap of semiconductors. The HSE method is often used to correct the gap values. Although the PBE method underestimates the band gap, it is still able to predict the correct trend in the band gap variation and to properly demonstrate the physical mechanism, and therefore the PBE results can still be expected to be meaningful. One should note that the more accurate HSE band structure can be basically obtained by upshifting/downshifting the CB/VB PBE bands, indicating that the band dispersions given by the PBE functional are still reasonable though the bandgap is too small. Also it shows that the PBE band gap values are larger than PBE + SOC, which is due to the spin splitting of the VBM and CBM. Since a local maximum in the VB and/or a local minimum in the CB is known as a valley and the band structure of an ideal valleytronic material is composed of two or more degenerate inequivalent valley states.52

(g) Schematic of the spin texture of the two bands around Γv, and the encircled numbers (1, 2 and 3) represent the magnified view of the valence band, conduction band-splitting at the K-point and Rashba spin splitting around Γv. 
In Fig. 3(g) we show the spin texture of the bands around Γv. Three arrows are labeled to designate the spin splitting along the uppermost valence band and lowermost conduction band. The CB and VB edges are characterized by degenerate valleys that are marked as λkc, λkv and Γv. Moreover, the first arrow shows the conduction band splitting at the CBM tagged as λkc, while the second shows the valence band splitting at the VBM labelled as λkv. The third arrow represents the intersection of the energy bands indicating the Rashba spin splitting with momentum offset KMR and KKR around Γv rendering Rashba energy EMR and EKR between the M and K symmetry points of the Brillion zone. In model-I, we can observe that the ZnO–MoSSe heterostructure gives an indirect band gap feature, whereas the ZnO–WSSe one possesses a direct band gap at the K point with semiconducting behavior.
In model-II, as illustrated in Fig. 3, both the ZnO–MoSSe and ZnO–WSSe heterostructures are indirect band gap semiconductors with band gap values of 0.73 eV and 0.95 eV from PBE calculations, respectively, as listed in Table 2. The corresponding VBM and CBM lie at the K and M points. The HSE06 functional enhanced the band gap values of such heterostructures to 2.1 eV and 2.3 eV, respectively. The spin–orbit interactions substantiate Rashba spin splitting, originating from the intersecting bands. The momentum offset KR and the Rashba energy ER are also indicated. The spin texture of the two bands is also correlated with the Rashba spin splitting around Γav. The calculated values of the Rashba energy, momentum offset and Rashba energies along the Γ, K and M directions respectively due to spin orbit interactions are given in Table 3, making the ZnO–Janus MXY heterostructures prominent for valleytronics.

Furthermore, to have a clear picture of the band alignment in the ZnO–Janus MXY heterostructures, we further calculate their weighted band structures, as depicted in Fig. 4. In the case of the model-I ZnO–MoSSe and ZnO–WSSe heterostructures, we can see from Fig. 5(a and b) that both the CBM and VBM of the band structures are due to Mo(W)-dz2 orbitals, presenting type-I band alignment, and thus they are suitable for laser applications.53 The weighted band structures of the ZnO–MoSSe and ZnO–WSSe heterostructures in model-II indicate type-II band alignment, where the CBM is due to the Mo(W)-dz2 orbital and the VBM is dominated by the O-pz orbital, as depicted in Fig. 5(c and d). Type-II band alignment reveals remarkable optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications due to the efficient electron–hole separation.

The green and blue lines represent the Mo(W)-dz2 and O-pz orbitals, respectively. Schematic of the charge density difference (with isovalue 0.00025 e per Bohr3) for the MoSSe–ZnO heterostructure in both model-I (e) and model-II (f). 
The charge density difference is also calculated to understand the underlying mechanism of charge transfer and charge redistribution in the ZnO–Janus MXY heterostructures. The charge density difference is calculated by: ρ = ρHetero − ρZnO − ρJanusMXY, where ρHetero, ρZnO and ρJanusMXY are the charge density of the ZnO–Janus MXY heterostructures, ZnO and the Janus MXY monolayers, respectively. The charge density difference of the ZnO–MoSSe heterostructure for model-I and model-II is visualized in Fig. 5(e) and (f), respectively, in which the yellow and red areas correspond to electron loss and gain, respectively. One can observe that in the ZnO–Janus MXY heterostructures, electrons flowed from ZnO to the Janus MXY layer. It indicates that electrons were donated by the ZnO layer, while the Janus MXY layers accept electrons, resulting in the formation of p-doping in the ZnO monolayer and n-doping in the Janus MXY layers. Moreover, we can observe that the charges are mainly redistributed between oxygen atoms and adjacent sulfide/selenium layers because of the difference in the electronegativity. Such charge redistribution in the ZnO–Janus MSSe heterostructures creates a built-in electric field, which spatially separates the photogenerated charge carriers. Furthermore, a Bader charge analysis demonstrates that only 0.14 electrons per unit cell are transferred from ZnO to MoSSe layers, verifying the weak vdW interaction between ZnO and Janus MXY monolayers.
4 Photocatalysis
In photocatalytic activity, separation of charge carriers in the conduction and valence bands of semiconductors by light illumination induces the redox reaction that ultimately gives hydrogen and oxygen by splitting water. ZnO has the best photocatalytic36 response and its activity is being checked for its heterostructures with Janus transition metal dichalcogenides. The photocatalytic water splitting for the ZnO, MoSSe and WSSe Janus monolayers and ZnO–Janus vdW heterostructures (model-I and model-II) with relative positions of chalcogen atoms on opposite surfaces of the transition metal is investigated by using Mulliken electronegativity EVBM = χ − Eelec + 0.5Eg and ECBM = EVBM − Eg for pH = 0/acidic environment.54,55 The Fermi level is set at an energy of −4.44 eV.
The ZnO–Janus vdW heterostructures have suitable band gaps for photocatalytic water splitting (see Table 2). Also for a good photocatalytic response the materials also need appropriate band edge positions for the reduction and oxidation potentials. The reduction/oxidation ability could be evaluated by the alignment of the CBM and VBM with respect to the water redox potential levels. Fig. 6 shows the band edge alignments of ZnO, the Janus monolayers and the ZnO–Janus vdW heterostructures with respect to the water reduction and oxidation potential levels at pH = 0. It can be clearly seen that both the CB and VB edges of the MoSSe, WSSe and ZnO monolayers are located more negative and more positive than the redox potential of H+/H2 and O2/H2O, respectively, which shows a good response for photocatalytic activities, also in good agreement with previous work.38,56,57 In the ZnO–MoSSe and ZnO–WSSe heterostructures (model-I) the level of the CB and VB is higher than that of the standard redox potentials. These energy levels are sufficient for electrons and holes to dissociate water into H+/H2 and O2/H2O, which makes the ZnO–MoSSe and ZnO–WSSe heterostructures (model-I) have good photocatalytic activities. Fig. 6 also shows that for ZnO–MoSSe (model-II) the VB edge straddles the oxidation potential while the CB edge is significantly lower than the reduction potential and thus fails to reduce water into H+/H2, while the ZnO–WSSe heterostructure (model-II) shows a good photocatalytic response. Comparing both models shows that model-I shows a good photocatalytic response compared to model-II due to the relative order of chalcogen atoms in the Janus monolayers by vdW stacking with the ZnO monolayer. A similar trend is also demonstrated for GeC–MSSe (M = Mo, W) van der Waals heterostructures.38 Most of reduction and oxidation processes involve in aqueous solution, which are closely correlated with pH = 0 and pH = 7 properties. We already addressed the performance of the ZnO–Janus heterostructure for an acid environment, which shows a good response. Now to check these heterostructures for pH = 7, we used the Nernst equation,58–60 which is EpH = 0 − 0.059 × pH. The values obtained for pH = 7 are also given in Table 2, which also confirms that all these heterostructures show a good response for a basic environment. Using this equation, we can obtain the redox potentials of H+/H2 and H2O/O2 for any pH. As the pH value increases from 0 to 14, the corresponding redox potentials (H+/H2 and H2O/O2) will shift upward. All these results are listed in Table 2. This process for conversion of solar light into hydrogen is an attractive technique for the production of clean and renewable energy device applications.61

5 Conclusion
In summary, we have investigated systematically ZnO–Janus heterostructures in detail, such as the electronic properties, charge density difference, work function, band alignment and photocatalytic properties, using first-principles calculations. Two different possible models of ZnO–Janus heterostructures are presented with alternative orders of chalcogen atoms at opposite surfaces in the Janus monolayers. The most favorable stacking pattern of both models is shown to be dynamically and energetically feasible by finding the thermal stabilities and binding energies of the ZnO–Janus heterostuctures. We find that the band structures of ZnO–MoSSe and ZnO–WSSe are indirect band gaps for both models while model-I shows type-I and model-II shows type-II band alignment respectively. In particular, a greater Rashba spin polarization is demonstrated in ZnO–WSSe in model-I compared to the other heterostructures. The inter layer charge transfer shows that the electrons transfer from the ZnO to Janus monolayers. Furthermore, valence (conduction) band edge potentials are calculated to understand the photocatalytic behavior of these systems. The energetically favourable band edge positions in the ZnO–Janus heterostructures make them suitable for water splitting at zero pH. We found that the ZnO–Janus heterostructures are promising candidates for water splitting with conduction and valence band edges positioned just outside of the redox interval. Furthermore, the ZnO–MoSSe heterostructure possesses the strongest reduction power, while the ZnO–WSSe heterostructure possesses the strongest oxidation power.
