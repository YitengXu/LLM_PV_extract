    , Accepted 20th April 2017First published on 20th April 2017AbstractCIGS-based heterostructures have been demonstrated to achieve superior high absorption and photovoltaic effects theoretically and experimentally, making them extremely attractive for realizing optoelectronic devices. However, the applications of CIGS are mainly focused on solar cells. In this work, the lateral photovoltaic effect (LPE) is firstly observed in the CIGS film with a glass/Mo/CIGS/CdS/ZnO/ITO structure, indicating its great potential for application in position sensitive detectors (PSDs). LPE measurements reveal that this structured PSD exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity and excellent linearity even to a very large working distance of 28 mm in the visible-near-infrared range with the position sensitivity up to 431.6 mV mm−1. Notably, the detector shows ultrafast response speed with a rise time of 8.3 μs and a fall time of 7.7 μs, and capability to work stably under air conditions for a very long time. The unprecedented performance could be attributed to the good quality of this CIGS structure, as well as the unique optical properties of the CIGS layer and the excellent conductivity of the ITO layer. These findings suggest that the glass/Mo/CIGS/CdS/ZnO/ITO structure has great potential for application in the field of visible-near-infrared optical position sensitive detection and might be used as elements for the construction of high-speed integrated optoelectronic sensor circuitry.
Introduction
Recently, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) has attracted much interest due to its very promising properties such as high absorption coefficient (×105 cm−1),1 tuneable direct energy band-gap (1.04–1.67 eV) on the account of Ga concentration,2–4 high conversion efficiency, and outstanding thermal, environmental and electrical stabilities.5–7 Moreover, CIGS is one of the most efficient and low cost compound materials,8,9 which are able to accommodate mass-manufacturing. To date, CIGS has been successfully used in thin film solar cells,10–12 solar modules,13,14 and photoelectrochemical (PEC) photocathodes.15 In particular solar cells are one of the most promising applications of CIGS thin films, and researchers have already achieved conversion efficiencies exceeding 20% on a lab-scale11,12 and large-scale module efficiencies close to 16%.16 However, to our knowledge, it has never been used as a lateral photovoltaic effect (LPE) material. The LPE was first discovered by Schottky17 and later expanded by Wallmark,18 who used it in a position sensitive detector (PSD) based on its unique feature of lateral photovoltage (LPV) linearly dependent on laser irradiation position. Since then, it was boosted very quickly in many different semiconductor systems, such as Ti/Si superlattices,19 modulation-doped GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures,20,21 hydrogenated amorphous silicon structures,22,23 perovskite materials,24,25 and metal (/oxide)–semiconductor structures.26–28 The performance of a PSD is usually evaluated based on three parameters: position sensitivity, nonlinearity, and working area (or pathlength).23 More importantly, wide response broadband and rapid optical response speed will immensely expand its potential application space in LPE-based sensors.29–31
In this work we will first report a significant ultrahigh position sensitivity, ultrafast response speed and wide broadband LPE observed in CIGS films based on the glass/Mo/CIGS/CdS/ZnO/ITO structure. This will add a completely new functionality to CIGS and make it a potential candidate for versatile materials. We find that this glass/Mo/CIGS/CdS/ZnO/ITO structure has a very high position sensitivity of 431.6 mV mm−1 and a very good nonlinearity (no more than 3%), and importantly a very large response size, all of which make it a promising candidate for PSD devices or other LPE-based optical transducers and sensors. In addition, we give a detailed study of the LPV response to different wavelengths and modulating frequency under different electrode contact distances. These results show that the LPV has a very wide wavelength response range of 330–1150 nm and a very fast response speed of 8.3 μs, and both the position sensitivity and the response speed decrease gradually with increasing electrode distances. We also put forward a complete theoretical analysis to explain this LPE. All data and analyses demonstrate that this CIGS structure may be a candidate of priority in high performance multifunctional photodetectors.
Experimental
The CIGS film with the structure of glass/Mo/CIGS/CdS/ZnO/ITO was prepared as follows. Firstly, a Mo thin film was deposited on a 3.2 mm thick soda-lime glass (SLG) substrate by magnetron sputtering. The SLG substrate was cleaned with soap solution and de-ionized water and then dried with N2 gas and a base pressure of lower than 1 × 10−5 Pa was achieved before the deposition. The 380 mm × 80 mm Mo metal target was mounted in the sputtering chamber. During the sputtering, the power of 800 W was imposed on the target by the DC pulse power supply, argon gas was introduced into the chamber acting as sputtering gas with a flow rate of 30 sccm, and the working pressure was kept at 1 Pa. Secondly, a CIGS absorber layer with a thickness of about 2 μm was deposited on the sputtered Mo electrode/SLG substrate using a 3-stage co-evaporation technology. Then, a 100 nm thick CdS buffer layer was grown using the chemical bath deposition method. Finally, an intrinsic zinc oxide and n-type indium tin oxide (ITO) were sputtered on the surface as the transparent and conductive layers. Details of the preparation can be found in ref. 32, and the structure sketch is shown in Fig. 1a.

For LPE measurement, the sample was scanned spatially with a continuous wave semiconductor laser beam focused on a roughly 50 μm diameter spot at the surface and without any spurious illumination reaching the samples. Before the measurement, two contact point indium electrodes were prepared on the ITO surface with a point diameter less than 1 mm, and the contacts showed no measurable rectifying behavior, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). A film with areas of 30 mm × 30 mm was selected. During the measurement, the laser beam was illuminated perpendicularly on the sample surface with a constant space position, and the sample was moved horizontally by an electronic control platform with a SourceMeter measuring the voltage difference between the two electrodes simultaneously. The LPE schematic diagram and a typical LPV curve are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1b, when the laser beam is illuminated on the ITO side of the CIGS structure, the values of the measured LPV shows the linear change trend versus the laser spot position during the two contact electrodes as reported in other systems.20,21,26–28,33 Moreover, in order to investigate the dependence of the LPV response strength and speed to contact distance, the distance between two contact electrodes was changed from 28 mm to 0.4 mm gradually during measurement, and only this single sample was used for comparison, ensuring the credibility of the results.
Results and discussion
Firstly, we measured the LPVs as a function of the laser spot position in the glass/Mo/CIGS/CdS/ZnO/ITO structure with a contact distance of 1.8 mm and under a 532 nm laser illumination. The output laser power was changed from 0 to 70 mW through an optical attenuation, as shown in Fig. 2a. From the LPV curves, one can get two key parameters: nonlinearity, which is the nonlinear distortion of the output LPV; and position sensitivity, which represents the linear fitting slope of the curve. We can observe that all the results of the LPV versus laser position present very good linearities with the largest nonlinearity of 0.86% based on the nonlinearity equation,23 indicating that the measurement accuracy of this PSD is very high. The extracted position sensitivity, which increases from 0.69 mV mm−1 to a saturated value of 200.9 mV mm−1 with increasing laser power, is displayed in Fig. 2b. As far as we know, it is the largest position sensitivity under so good linearity. In addition, we can also observe that the position sensitivity is nearly linearly proportional to the laser power when it is below 7.5 mW, and then increases gradually slowly until it is saturated when the power exceeds 25 mW, which can be attributed to the rapidly increasing recombination rate of the carriers in the region of irradiation with increasing laser intensity.33

In order to understand the dependence of this LPE to the laser wavelength, LPV curves as a function of the laser position were measured under five typical lasers ranging from visible to infrared, including 405 nm, 532 nm, 671 nm, 808 nm, and 980 nm. The measurement results of 5 mW laser illumination are shown in Fig. 3a. The LPV, which first increases quickly and then decreases gradually with increasing laser wavelength, presents a complex and non-monotonic dependence on the laser wavelength. Then, we also measured the LPVs under illumination of different laser powers for all those lasers, and the extracted position sensitivities exhibit a similar increasing tendency as that of 532 nm laser with increasing laser power, as shown in Fig. 3b. Moreover, it is also observed that the LPE shows a similar wavelength dependency without depending on the intensity of laser power (but the position sensitivity difference among different laser wavelengths increases gradually with increasing laser power until saturation).

To understand the power- and wavelength-dependent LPE in this glass/Mo/CIGS/CdS/ZnO/ITO structure, we proposed the following model with the equilibrium band diagram shown in Fig. 4a.

Due to the high transmittance of the ITO, ZnO, and CdS films for the measured wavelength range, when the laser illuminates on the ITO film surface, the laser energy was mainly absorbed by the CIGS layer to generate electron–hole pairs, as shown in Fig. 4b. The relationship between the amount of the excited electron–hole pairs (N) and the laser power (P) per second under illumination of a laser with a constant wavelength (λ) can be written as: (1)where ℏ is the Planck' constant and c is the light speed.
The photon-excited electron–hole pairs in CIGS will diffuse in the junction and then the electrons and holes can be separated by the interface built-in field and transited to the ITO layer and the Mo layer, respectively. The electric field gradient between the illuminated and the non-illuminated zones results in excess electron diffusion from the illuminated spot toward the A and B electrodes. If the lateral distance of the laser spot to A and B electrodes is different, then a LPV will be produced, and the involved position sensitivity of LPV can be presented as:26–28 (2)where l0 is the electron diffusion length in the ITO layer, L is the half distance between the two contact electrodes, Neff is the effective electron amount which can be expressed as Neff = ξNβ [ξ is the quantum efficiency and β is a proportional coefficient] with 0 < β < 1 considering the re-exciting of the recombined carriers, and k is a constant coefficient. Substituting eqn (1) into eqn (2), the position sensitivity can be written as: (3)In eqn (3), with changing the laser power, the recombination rate δ and the carrier lifetime τ should be different, so that we suggest that k is related to the power-dependent carrier recombination rate and lifetime, which can be described as (1 − δτγP/Neff).27,34 Therefore, eqn (3) can be rewritten as: (4)where γ is the proportional coefficient. From eqn (4), it is clear that the position sensitivity should increase quickly and then get saturated with increasing laser power, which is in accordance with our results as the well fitted red solid lines shown in Fig. 3b. Moreover, it seems that the position sensitivity should also be proportional to the laser wavelength if neglecting other influence factors under illumination of a constant laser power. Considering this contradiction with the experimental results, it is suggested that the photon quantum efficiency (ξ) may play an important role in this system. Therefore, we measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of this structure, as shown in Fig. 5. It is observed that the EQE has a very large laser response broadband ranging from near-ultraviolet of 330 nm even to the infrared of 1150 nm, and it is low in the low wavelength range, and increases quickly to a maximum at about 660 nm, and then decreases gradually with increasing laser wavelength again. For the 405 nm laser illumination, both the laser wavelength and its EQE are very low, so that the LPE response or position sensitivity is the lowest. And then the LPE response increases gradually with increasing laser wavelength from 532 nm to 808 nm mainly due to the increased laser wavelength (neglecting the little EQE difference). Although the laser wavelength of 980 nm is larger than that of 808 nm, its EQE is lower. More importantly, the wavelength parameter has an index β (β ≈ 0.5 deduced by fitting) in eqn (4), making the wavelength contribution a little less than that of EQE. That is maybe why the LPE response starts to be reduced.

As previously reported, response speed should be one of the key figures of merit for an optical photodetector,35 particularly for that utilized in optical communication, imaging, and so on. In order to evaluate the response speed of this structure, we further investigated the response and the relaxation time by combining a laser chopper and a digital oscilloscope, with a schematic diagram shown in Fig. 6a. Firstly, we measured the photovoltage response under illumination of a constant laser spot position (x = −0.6 mm) and a constant laser power (10 mW) at different chopper frequencies ranging from 50 to 4000 Hz, as shown in Fig. 6b–d. The photovoltage balance values (Vmax corresponding to laser on and Vmin corresponding to laser off) nearly remain constant even at a very high frequency of 4000 Hz, suggesting that the glass/Mo/CIGS/CdS/ZnO/ITO structured PSD can work well over a wide switching frequency range and is capable of monitoring ultrafast optical signals. From the magnified photoresponse curve of 4000 Hz in Fig. 6e and f, a small rise time (tr) and fall time (tf) of 9 μs and 8 μs can be estimated, respectively. Moreover, in order to obtain whether the response speed is dependent on the laser spot position or not, we also measured the photovoltage response at different laser spot positions ranging from −0.9 mm to 0.9 mm, as shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†). It is found that not only the photovoltage balance values of any laser spot position is independent of the chopper frequency, but also the rise and the fall time is independent of the laser spot position, as shown in Fig. S2b (ESI†), which further indicates that this structure shows great potential in LPE-based ultrafast sensors. Furthermore, for the commercial PSDs, the property stability should also be very important, and thus we investigated the air stability of the glass/Mo/CIGS/CdS/ZnO/ITO PSD by placing it directly in air for two months without any encapsulation. The device showed remarkably high durability, and no obvious changes can be observed when the device was measured at 4000 Hz chopper frequency again, as shown in Fig. 7. The high stability of this device is directly related to the excellent air stability of this structure, especially the CIGS film, which is one of its most important advantages.7 All the results demonstrate that this PSD can preserve high performance under air conditions for a very long time.

(e) and (f) show the enlarged rise and fall edges of the lateral photovoltage curve, respectively. The rise time (tr) is the time interval for the response to rise from 10% to 90% of its peak value. The fall time (tf) is the time interval for the response to decay from 90% to 10% of its peak value.

For commercial PSDs, the large response pathlength is also an important parameter23 and some researchers have tried their best to seek for long-range devices,36,37 and thus we studied the LPE response of this structure under different contact distances ranging from 0.4 mm to 12 mm. Fig. 8a gives the laser position-dependent LPVs at different contact distances under illumination of 5 mW for a 532 nm laser. We can observe that the LPV curves show very good linearity with the nonlinearity no more than 3% under 2L ≤ 8 mm, and when the contact distance reaches 12 mm, the nonlinearity becomes a little worse (4.37%), but it is still much lower than the allowable value of 15%22 (and even for the largest contact distance of 28 mm, the nonlinearity is also no more than 15%, not given here). There are mainly two reasons for the good linearity, one is that the ITO, which is usually used as a transparent and conductive layer in photovoltaic or photoelectric devices,38,39 is a very good conductive material with large mobility μ, so that its diffusion length should be very large based on the Einstein relation ;40 the other is that the strong build-in electric field, which exists at this structure, can greatly facilitate the separation and transport of photo-generated electron–hole pairs, resulting in a high electric field gradient due to lots of separated electrons at the laser spot position. The presence of an in-plane electric field largely prolongs the carrier diffusion distance. Moreover, in order to illustrate whether the contact distance-dependent LPEs change with laser power or not, we then measured the LPVs under illumination of different laser powers for each contact distances, and the extracted position sensitivities for a 532 nm laser are shown in Fig. 8b. It is clear that the laser power-dependent position sensitivities at different contact distances have a similar increasing tendency as that of 1.8 mm. However, the position sensitivity increases more quickly with increasing laser power for shorter contact distances (which can be well explained by eqn (4) as position sensitivity is inversely proportional to L), that is the position sensitivity difference between different contact distances increases gradually and then reaches its maximum until the position sensitivity is saturated. Besides, the LPE response of different contact distances exhibits similar laser wavelength dependency, as shown in Fig. 8c. It is worth pointing out that the saturated position sensitivity of 431.6 mV mm−1 for 808 nm is the best result achieved until now among all the previously reported systems in the visible range, such as semiconductor p–n junctions,22,23 metal–semiconductor or metal–oxide–semiconductor structures,26–28,41 perovskite materials,24,25 and organic semiconductor polymers.42 More importantly, the largest position sensitivity of 385.8 mV mm−1 for 980 nm not only outshines any previously reported results in the infrared range,43,44 but also is even much larger than the reported maximum in the visible range,40 suggesting that this structure is of great importance for the application of LPE in the visible-infrared PSDs.

(b) Position sensitivity as a function of optical power for different contact distances under illumination of a 532 nm laser. (c) The saturated position sensitivity of different laser wavelengths as a function of contact distance. 
Furthermore, we also investigated the response speed under different contact distances, with the results of four typical distances shown in Fig. S3a–d (ESI†), respectively. Interestingly, the Vmax is nearly independent of the contact distance even at a very high chopper frequency of 4000 Hz, but the Vmin remains at zero only when the contact distance is less than about 8 mm, and then increases a little with increasing contact distance. However, upon decreasing the chopper frequency gradually, the Vmin starts to approach zero, as shown in Fig. S3e and f (ESI†), suggesting that the response speed decreases with increasing contact distance. Fig. 9 gives the deduced rise and fall times under different contact distances. It is observed that the rise (fall) time increases from 8.3 (7.7) μs to 23.9 (125) μs upon increasing the contact distance from 0.4 mm to 12 mm. There are mainly three reasons for the increased response speed, one is that the carriers require to transport longer distance to reach the electrodes for larger contact distance, and the surface electric field gradient is also reduced, leading to the longer diffusion time. Secondly, if the number of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs and the separated electrons in the laser spot position is the same under the same laser illumination conditions, and the accumulated number of the diffused electrons at the two electrodes under small contact distances is larger than that under large contact distances, then these large numbers of electrons under small contact distances can easily tunnel through the built-in field to recombine with the holes in the CIGS layer when the laser is turned off due to larger longitudinal carriers' gradient,45 and thus the fall time is relatively small. Thirdly, the changed resistances of different contact distances may also more or less have an effect on the measurement circuit.28

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the lateral photovoltaic effect (LPE) of the glass/Mo/CIGS/CdS/ZnO/ITO structure with changing laser powers, laser wavelengths, electrode distances, and chopper frequencies. This structured device exhibits excellent LPE performances, i.e., large response size, very good nonlinearity, and high position sensitivity in the visible-near-infrared laser range. More importantly, the results also suggest that this structure shows ultrafast response speed with excellent stability and reproducibility, making it suitable for high-speed LPE-based sensor applications. The high position sensitivity and fast response time can be attributed to the good quality of the synthesized CIGS structure and the excellent conductivity of the ITO layer. We believe that the development of CIGS-based optical position sensitive detectors in our work will pave the way for high sensitivity, wide broadband, and ultrafast LPE-based optoelectric device applications.
