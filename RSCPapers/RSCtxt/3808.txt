    , Accepted 30th October 2017First published on 14th November 2017AbstractHighly dense CaMn1−xRexO3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.04) samples were prepared by solid-state synthesis. The effect of Re doping was assessed by the characterisation of crystal structure, oxygen content, and electrical and thermal transport properties. The oxidation state of the substituted Re was determined by X-ray absorption near edge spectra to be Re7+, and led to expansion of the lattice and an increase in electron carrier concentration due to the formation of Mn3+. The thermal behaviour of the electrical conductivity and the thermopower over a wide temperature range allowed identification of different conduction mechanisms: (1) below 110 K, 3D variable range hopping, (2) between 110 and 650 K, small polaron transport, and (3) above 650 K, activation of carriers over a mobility edge. Evaluation of the power factor expected for different dopant oxidation states as a function of dopant concentration shows that the doping strategy using a heavy heptavalent ion allows accessibility of the peak power factor at lower dopant concentrations, lowering the amount of non-ionised impurities, and therefore improves the electronic substitution efficiency, the ratio of activated carriers over the nominal doping concentration, compared to previously studied dopants. An increased power factor and a reduced lattice thermal conductivity are obtained with a peak figure of merit ZT = 0.16(3) at 947 K for CaMn0.98Re0.02O3. This is an approximately two-fold increase compared to undoped CaMnO3, and is comparable to the highest values reported for highly dense B-site doped CaMnO3.
Introduction
Thermoelectric power generators are solid-state devices that directly convert heat energy into electricity and their applications include automotive waste heat recovery, solar/geothermal power conversions and space vehicle power sources.1–5 There are no moving parts involved, thus they are silent, reliable and versatile.6,7 They are particularly attractive in industrial waste heat recovery since it is estimated that 20–50% of energy consumed in this sector is eventually lost to waste heat, but the materials in such applications require high thermal stability (at ≈1000 K), oxidation resistance in air and low toxicity as well as high efficiency.8–11
Perovskite-type CaMnO3 is one of the n-type thermoelectric oxides that fulfils the majority of the requirements but falls short in the efficiency of conversion,1,8,9 which is usually assessed by the dimensionless figure of merit ZT = S2T/ρκ, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, ρ the electrical resistivity and κ the thermal conductivity at temperature T. The common approaches to improve ZT for CaMnO3 are aliovalent substitution at either the A- or B-sites; (i) the substitution of species of differing mass in the CaMnO3 lattice results in the presence of phonon scattering centres, which inhibits the migration of thermal energy as vibrations, thus reducing the lattice thermal conductivity of the system, and (ii) the introduction of higher charged species increases the charge carrier concentration by charge compensation (i.e. introduction of d4 Mn3+ carriers into the integer valence d3 Mn4+ Mott insulator) following the Kröger–Vink notation: (1)where an element X has the oxidation state of n + 4.
The creation of free electrons in the system results in an increased conductivity and a reduced Seebeck coefficient.12–27 Thus, the best compromise was sought to optimise the effect of the substitution to maximise the power factor defined as S2/ρ. Recently, Thiel et al. reported significant improvements in the thermoelectric properties of CaMnO3 through B-site modification with elements that are both heavy and display higher oxidation states such as Nb and Ta where n = 1, and W and Mo where n = 2.28,29 The electrical properties of these electron doped CaMnO3 materials are often described with the small polaron-hopping-based mechanism, and it was shown that higher charged species are more suitable to increase conductivity. For both n = 1 and n = 2 doping strategies, they observed that above a doping concentration threshold (x = 0.08 and x = 0.04, respectively), the amount of free carriers generated by the impurities is smaller than the nominal dopant concentration and therefore the efficiency of electronic substitution is decreased.28,29 This can be due to the reduced mobility of the carriers as scattering by impurities is increased and thus the generation of non-ionised impurities with localised electrons. A possible solution to this problem is to explore dopants with n > 2, which would reduce the amount of dopant necessary to achieve the same level of electronic substitution.
Re is a third transition series element that exhibits various oxidation states in oxide chemistry; three binary oxides (ReO2, ReO3 and Re2O7) are known and many ordered double perovskites containing Re5+, Re6+ and Re7+ can be isolated.30,31 The possibility of substituting Mn with Re7+ in CaMnO3 (corresponding to n = 3) in the compensation mechanism with a single Re7+ in place of Mn4+ creating three Mn3+ could offer an effective alternative doping strategy to overcome the current limitation. In addition, Re offers a large mass difference compared to Mn, thus it is expected to act as an excellent phonon scattering centre. Previous reports of Re-substituted CaMnO3 have focused on the low temperature electrical properties for colossal magneto-resistance,32 and the Re oxidation state was not experimentally determined and was reasonably assumed to be Re5+. This work demonstrates the possibility of tuning the carrier concentration in this system with a resistivity as low as 4.1 mΩ cm and a Seebeck coefficient of −100 μV K−1 at 300 K for 6% Re atomic substitution corresponding to a 300 K power factor of 2.5 μW cm−1 K−2, which is similar to other B-site doped CaMnO3 compounds.14–16,18 In our study, we have determined experimentally that the Re oxidation state is 7+ in this system and therefore corresponds to n = 3, which is higher than that of previous dopants. By measuring the electrical and thermal properties over a wide range of temperature (4–947 K), we established the different conduction mechanisms in different temperature regimes. The high temperature (372–947 K) thermoelectric properties show that the incorporation of a heptavalent cation in CaMnO3 is an effective strategy to improve the power factor in this system.
Experimental
High purity (≥99.9%) CaCO3, MnO2 and Re metal were used to prepare CaMn1−xRexO3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.04) samples. The powders were ball-milled in 2-propanol with ZrO2 balls (350 rpm overnight, Fritsch Pulverisette 7 Planetary Mill), dried and heated initially to 1173 K for 6 hours followed by 1523 K for 12 hours before ball-milling again. The resultant powders were pressed as pellets (1.3 cm diameter) using a uniaxial press first and further pressed using a cold isostatic press with a maximum pressure of 30k psi. The resulting discs were sintered at 1323–1623 K for 24 hours and slowly cooled (0.2 K min−1) to 873 K to avoid disintegration due to the cubic to orthorhombic phase transition,12 then cooled to room temperature by turning off the furnace. Density of the sintered pellets was calculated with the Archimedes method. The optimised sintering process afforded ceramics with a density >98% as this is essential for an accurate assessment of the thermoelectric properties.33 All the samples prepared in this study are crack free, as shown in ESI,† Fig. S1 and have a relative density of ≥98(1)%, almost reaching the theoretical limit, as shown in ESI,† Table S1. The critical effect of the density on the electrical properties of an undoped CaMnO3 ceramic is shown in ESI,† Fig. S2.
The oxygen content was measured for all samples using thermogravimetric profiles collected with a TA Instruments Q600 SDT on 100 mg of powder sample derived from the sintered pellets. The samples were heated (10 K min−1) to 1223 K under flowing 4 vol% H2/N2. The reduction products were identified by X-ray diffraction (ESI,† Fig. S3). Based on the identities of the reduction products, the room temperature oxygen vacancy content was calculated and is presented in Table S1 (ESI†). All the samples showed negligible oxygen vacancy content (δ ≤ 0.01). The slow cooling process was also used to minimise the amount of oxygen vacancies in the system,12,34,35 which would introduce undesired carriers.
Phase purity was determined initially using laboratory X-ray powder diffraction data (XRD) collected on a Bruker-AXS D8 Advance diffractometer with a fine focus Mo Kα source (λ = 0.71073 Å). Synchrotron XRD data recorded on beamline I11 (λ = 0.825972 Å) at Diamond Light Source, UK, allowed the precise lattice parameter determination and identification of impurities with high sensitivity.
Re L3-edge X-ray absorption near edge spectra (XANES) were collected on Beamline B18 at Diamond Light Source, UK. The samples were diluted with cellulose powder and pressed into pellets of approximately 1 mm thick. Data were collected in transmission mode and spectra were normalised using ATHENA.36 Reference samples for different Re oxidation states were prepared by a standard solid-state method (ESI,† Fig. S4): Ba2YReO6 for Re5+, Ba2CaReO6 for Re6+and Ba2NaReO6 for Re7+.
The sintered pellets were cut into a bar shape (≈2 × 4 × 8 mm) and the resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient were measured using an ULVAC ZEM3 Seebeck coefficient/electric resistance measuring system with a four probe arrangement under a He atmosphere from 326 to 947 K. The low temperature electrical and thermal properties were measured using the Thermal Transport Option in a DynaCool system (Quantum Design) under vacuum from 4 to 370 K. Thermal expansion profiles were collected using a Netzsch DIL 402C under static air with the temperature ranging from 300 to 973 K. Thermal diffusivity of sintered pellets, which were polished and coated with graphite, was measured using a Netzsch LFA 457 under flowing N2 (100 ml min−1) with the temperature ranging from 323 to 948 K. Heat flux profiles of thin slices of sintered pellets were obtained using a Netzsch DSC 404 F1 under flowing N2 (50 ml min−1) with the temperature ranging from 323 to 948 K. Measurements of the reference sapphire (Netzsch) under the same conditions and heating programme were used to calculate the heat capacities of the samples. The error for the resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient is ≈±5% and that of the calculated thermal conductivity is ≈±6%, which are shown in the relevant figures.
Results and discussion
The incorporation of Re7+
The synchrotron XRD patterns for the CaMn1−xRexO3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.04) samples are presented in Fig. 1a. They are all single phase samples adopting orthorhombic symmetry with the Pnma space group confirmed by full-profile analysis with the Pawley method, which means that all the Re-doped CaMnO3 samples are isostructural to the parent CaMnO3. All the peaks showed a gradual shift to a lower angle with a higher doping level, which is highlighted by the most intense Bragg reflections in Fig. 1b, thus indicating lattice expansion with increased Re content. The lattice parameters for the samples obtained by Pawley fitting are plotted in Fig. 1c and all three axes showed a monotonic increase with Re content similar to that observed for pentavalent (Nb5+, Ta5+ and Ru5+) and hexavalent (Mo6+ and W6+) dopants.13–16,28 The ionic radii for each cation on the B-site are Mn3+ = 0.645 Å, Mn4+ = 0.53 Å and potentially Re5+ = 0.58 Å, Re6+ = 0.55 Å or Re7+ = 0.53 Å.37 The presence of Re alone in any of the candidate oxidation states would not be expected to induce any major change in the lattice parameter since its radius is close to that of Mn4+, but the creation of larger Mn3+ by the charge compensation mechanism will certainly expand the lattice. To assess the degree of electronic substitution (n = 1, 2 or 3 in eqn (1)) and determine the charge carrier mechanism, it is crucial to determine the Re oxidation state.

Errors are smaller than the symbol size. The Rietveld refinement details for x = 0.02 are presented in the ESI,† Fig. S5 and Table S2. 
The oxidation state of Re in the CaMn1−xRexO3 (0.005 ≤ x ≤ 0.04) samples was determined by XANES. All the Re-doped samples have the same Re oxidation state as all the spectra showed the same edge position at 10539.4 eV (Fig. 2 inset). This is a higher energy than those of Re5+ (10537.8 eV) and Re6+ (10538.7 eV) in Ba2YReO6 and Ba2CaReO6 reference samples, respectively, and corresponds to the edge position of Re7+ (10539.2 eV) in the Ba2NaReO6 reference sample (Fig. 2). This was not unexpected as the use of ambient air in the preparation of Ba2NaReO6 resembles the synthetic conditions for the CaMn1−xRexO3 series more closely than the other two Re5+ and Re6+ reference samples, which were prepared under reduced oxygen partial pressure in sealed tubes.

Inset: Normalised Re L3-edge XANES spectra for the CaMn1−xRexO3 (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.04) which show the identical edge positions for all the compositions. 
The rate of expansion of the cell volume as a function of the doping level x for the Re-doped samples is 68(2) Å3x−1, which is greater than 53(3) Å3x−1 for the W doped series, consistent with Re adopting the 7+ oxidation state.12 The greater cell expansion rate by the incorporation of higher charged species was demonstrated by the comparison between penta- and hexavalent dopants and rationalised by the introduction of the increased number of Mn3+ per substitution.28 In conjunction with the cell parameter increase that matches well with the Re oxidation state from the XANES study, it is evident that the incorporation of Re7+ into the CaMnO3 perovskite structure has been successful.
Electrical and thermoelectric properties: determination of the conduction mechanism
The resistivity and Seebeck coefficient of the CaMn1−xRexO3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.04) samples as a function of temperature between 326 K and 947 K are shown in Fig. 3. The negative values of the Seebeck coefficient for the series indicate the dominant n-type conduction expected based on the dopant charge state. The resistivity and the absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient for all the samples increase with increasing temperature in this temperature interval, which is typically observed in compounds where the conduction mechanism is limited by the mobility of the carriers such as metals, degenerate semiconductors and polaronic transport at high temperature. It is widely agreed that Mott's adiabatic small polaron conduction model can be used for n-type calcium manganites at high temperature.38 In this case, the resistivity is activated but does not follow the Arrhenius law observed in broadband semiconductors, and a pre-exponential factor has to be included. This can be expressed in the form:  where Eρ is an activation energy corresponding to half of the polaron binding energy. Since the Seebeck coefficient is governed by the thermal activation of carriers across a barrier, it has a similar form to that of a band semiconductor and can be written as:  where Es is the activation energy corresponding to the Fermi energy and A is a constant associated with the spin and mixing entropy,39 which leads in the high temperature limit to the Heikes formula40 and the Seebeck coefficient converging towards:  where g is an electronic degeneracy parameter and y is the carrier concentration.
 Fig. 3  Plots of the (a) resistivity and (b) Seebeck coefficient between 326 K and 950 K for CaMn1−xRexO3 (0.00 ≤ x ≤ 0.04). 
One of the signatures of small polaronic conduction is the difference in energies involved in the resistivity and Seebeck description. If the transport was dominated by the thermal activation of carriers to a mobility edge, both activation energies would be equal (Eρ = Es), whereas for small polaron systems, Eρ > Es. Moreover, when Eρ is similar to kBT, the exponential term becomes negligible and the temperature dependence of the resistivity would be similar to a metal or degenerate semiconductor. The activation energies extracted for doped CaMnO3 are of the order of 30 meV, and it is therefore difficult to distinguish if the electrical properties should be described using band semiconductor or hopping models.12,24,29,41 To differentiate between these models, it is necessary to measure the low temperature electrical and thermal properties of these compounds.
The log(ρ) vs. log(T) plot for x = 0.03 from 35 to 947 K shown in Fig. 4a exhibits a significant decrease in resistivity from 35 to 200 K; the negative gradient persists up to 300 K then changes sign, suggesting an activated behaviour with an activation energy larger than 30 meV up to 300 K, therefore ruling out the degenerate semiconductor possibility.

(b) Adiabatic small polaron analysis of the resistivity between 110 and 950 K showing two activation energies (110–200 K blue line with Eρ1 = 40.0(2) meV and 250–950 K red line with Eρ2 = 25.4(1) meV). (c) Activation energy determination of the Seebeck coefficient between 200 and 950 K showing two linear regions: 200–650 K with Es1 = 15(1) meV and 650–100 K with Es2 = 45(2) meV. 

Fig. 4a also allows the identification of different conduction mechanisms in specific temperature regimes. A slope ν = −4.0(1) is obtained between 35 K and 110 K, which corresponds to 3D variable range hopping conduction.42 No temperature region shows a slope ν = −1, which would correspond to an activated broadband semiconductor following a conventional Arrhenius law. This suggests a thermal dependence of the pre-exponential factor as described above for the small polaron model. The logarithmic plot of ρ/T vs. 1/T in the temperature range of 110–900 K is shown in Fig. 4b and two linear regions can be identified: (i) 110–200 K with an activation energy Eρ1 = 40.0(2) meV and (ii) 250–950 K with an activation energy Eρ2 = 25.4(1) meV. To determine whether the small polaron model is valid in the complete temperature range studied, these activation energies have to be compared with the activation energies extracted from the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient. Fig. 4c presents the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient as a function of 1/T between 200 and 1000 K for x = 0.03 with two linear regions identified: (i) between 200 and 650 K with an activation energy Es1 = 15(1) meV and (ii) between 650 and 1000 K with an activation energy Es2 = 45(2) meV. Previous reports discussing the conduction mechanism in B-site doped CaMnO3 based on high temperature measurement have concluded that the conduction occurs via activation to the mobility edge,12 since they find a near-zero polaron-transport activation energy defined as ½W = Eρ − Es while in A-site substituted CaMnO3, it was observed that Eρ > Es,22 which is characteristic of electron transport due to polarons.43 In our case, we observe a transition from (i) transport occurring via thermally activated hopping of small polarons between 110 and 650 K (Fig. 4b and c blue line) to (ii) transport occurring via activation of carriers to a mobility edge for T > 650 K (Fig. 4b and c red line) where the small polaron model is not valid to describe the electrical and thermoelectric properties.
Power factor analysis
The first step to design efficient thermoelectric materials is to obtain large power factors, which is conventionally done by optimising the doping concentration. The power factors for CaMn1−xRexO3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.04) as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. 5a, revealing a minor temperature dependence. By combining the equations for the Seebeck coefficient and the resistivity in the high temperature limits (>650 K in our study), the power factor as a function of doping can be computed using the model of Thiel et al.29 and can be approximated as: (2)where NA = 1 − (n + 1)x is the number of available hopping sites for itinerant charge carriers (the number of Mn4+ ions) and c = nx/(1 − x) is the charge carrier concentration where n = 1 for pentavalent substitution, n = 2 for hexavalent substitution and n = 3 for heptavalent substitution. The advantage of using n = 3 compared to the two previously studied possibilities is illustrated in Fig. 5b (solid line) where the maximum power factor for n = 3 is achieved for a smaller substitution concentration. The isothermal power factor measured at 659 K as a function of Re content is superimposed with the model described in Fig. 5b (scattered). We obtain a good agreement between the model and the measured power factor with a peak power factor achieved at lower substitution levels compared to penta- and hexavalent dopants, which highlights the effectiveness of the n = 3 doping strategy by limiting the reduction in electronic doping at high substitution levels observed in previous studies for n = 1 and 2.29 The x = 0.01 and 0.02 samples exhibited a power factor value of ≈4.5 μW cm−1 K−2 at 326–947 K, which is similar to the highest power factor achieved for CaMn0.96Ta0.04O3, which shows a peak value of ≈5 μW cm−1 K−2 at ≈350 K.29

Solid lines in (b) are the isothermal power factors calculated using the model described in the text for different oxidation states of a dopant element (n = 1 for pentavalent, 2 for hexavalent and 3 for heptavalent substitution). 
Thermal conductivity
The experimentally obtained total thermal conductivity and estimated electronic and lattice thermal conductivity of the CaMn1−xRexO3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.04) samples as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. 6. The total thermal conductivity in these solids (κtotal) is the sum of two contributions, the lattice thermal conductivity (κlattice) arising from energy transferred via phonons and electrical thermal conductivity (κel) arising from the energy transferred via charge carriers: κel + κlattice = κtotal. In broadband semiconductors and metallic systems, the electrical thermal conductivity is commonly approximated with the Wiedemann–Franz law,44 κel = LT/ρ(3)where L is the Lorenz number and for a metallic system, this takes the Sommerfeld value of 2.45 × 10−8 W Ω K−2.45
 Fig. 6  (a) Total thermal conductivity and (b) the estimated lattice and electrical thermal conductivity as a function of temperature for the CaMn1−xRexO3 (0.00 ≤ x ≤ 0.04) series. 
If the Wiedemann–Franz law is generally applicable to solids where the charge carriers can be described using a broadband conduction model, it has been shown that in compounds showing strong electron–phonon correlation such as polaronic conductors,46 perovskite manganites,47 and cuprate superconductors,48 the Wiedmann–Franz law is not applicable. In the particular case of small polarons, the transfer of heat is carried out with the hopping of a charge carrier and some additional vibrational energy bound to the carrier leading to an electronic thermal conductivity smaller than that of a free carrier.46 The compounds studied here show a transition from small polaron conduction (between 110 and 650 K for x = 0.03) to carriers activated over a mobility edge (at T > 650 K for x = 0.03). In the small polaron conduction regime, κel is expected to be much smaller than the one determined using the free electron Wiedmann–Franz law, whereas in the activated conduction regime, the carriers move itinerantly and the free electron Wiedmann–Franz law is valid.
Since the Wiedmann–Franz law for free electrons provides an upper limit of κel regardless of the charge carrier conduction mechanism, the lattice contribution was calculated by subtracting the electronic thermal conductivity estimated using the free electron Wiedmann–Franz law (≤0.4 W m−1 K−1 for the Re-doped CaMnO3 series) from the experimentally obtained total thermal conductivity. It is worth noting that the estimated electronic conductivity is smaller than the experimental error of κtotal and the use of this approximation, which does not take into account the electron–phonon coupling, in this case is not expected to substantively affect the estimate of the electronic contribution to the total thermal conductivity.
The lattice thermal conductivity decreases with increasing Re content, corresponding to the disruption of phonon migration by the incorporation of the heavy Re atoms in the lattice, which act as point scattering centres. The total thermal conductivity shows the same trend, which indicates that the majority of thermal conduction for the series is through the lattice vibration: the electronic contribution is ≈2% for the undoped CaMnO3 and from 12 to 25% for the x = 0.04 material corresponding to the improved electrical resistivity and the decreased lattice thermal conductivity with increasing Re content. The lattice thermal conductivity decreases with increasing temperature, which indicates that the disruption of phonon migration is also dominated by phonon–phonon Umklapp scattering.49

ZT


ZT for the CaMn1−xRexO3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.04) materials increases with increasing temperature (Fig. 7a). Since the PF showed no significant temperature dependence, the temperature dependence of ZT originates from the thermal conductivity. The variation of ZT with Re content at three temperatures (373, 659 and 947 K) is shown in Fig. 7b, and it shows the near-parabolic relationship between ZT and Re content, similar to that of the PF. The peak is at x = 0.02 with the highest ZT value of 0.16(3) at 947 K. There was a shift to a higher doping level compared to the PF due to the influence of reduced thermal conductivity with increasing Re content. This peak value and the area under the plot of ZT vs. T are comparable to those of CaMn0.96Ta0.04O3, which is the highly dense (i.e., where the reported relative density is greater than 90%) best B-site doped CaMnO3 so far reported. Not only the ZT but also the PF and the thermal conductivity of x = 0.02 are comparable to those of CaMn0.96Ta0.04O3, despite the fact that x = 0.02 contains half of the dopant content compared to CaMn0.96Ta0.04O3. Since Ta and Re have negligible mass difference, this could originate from the increased amount of Mn3+ in the Re substitution case. Indeed, Ta/Nb and Mo/W doped samples show similar thermal conductivity as a function of the number of introduced Mn3+. Therefore, it is not only the point defects that decrease the thermal conductivity but also the changes induced by the introduction of Mn3+ such as lattice distortion because of the ionic radii difference.

Conclusions
In summary, we have prepared single phase samples of the CaMn1−xRexO3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.04) series with orthorhombic Pnma symmetry through solid-state synthesis. Highly dense samples were obtained by optimisation of the preparation procedure, which is a pre-requisite to appropriately assess the electrical and thermal properties. We have demonstrated using XANES that the substituted Re adopts the 7+ oxidation state. Several studies have reported the high temperature thermoelectric properties of substituted CaMnO3 with penta- and hexavalent ions on the B-site but the effect of the incorporation of a heptavalent B cation has not been studied so far. By measuring the electrical and thermoelectric properties in a wide temperature range, we were able to distinguish the different conduction mechanisms dominating in different temperature regimes. Below 110 K, a 3D variable range hopping mechanism is observed, followed by small polaron conduction between 110 and 650 K. At higher temperatures, the conduction mechanism is dominated by the activation of carriers above a mobility edge, which is similar to band conduction. The detailed understanding of the conduction mechanisms allowed for the analysis of power factor data using a reasonable model for transport, and its comparison with different dopant oxidation states highlighted the beneficial effect of the proposed doping strategy with a significant increase in power factor values compared to that of undoped CaMnO3, where the loss in the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient was outweighed by the improvement in resistivity. Moreover, it shows that heptavalent substitution generates a peak power factor at lower substitution concentrations and therefore avoids the effective reduction in electronic substitution observed for penta- and hexavalent substitution. We observe a peak power factor of 4.5(7) μW cm−1 K−2 for x = 0.02, which is equivalent to the peak power factor reported for Ta5+ for x = 0.04. A further positive effect of Re incorporation was the significantly reduced lattice thermal conductivity with a relatively small amount of doping compared to penta- and hexavalent dopants; we observe 2.6(2) W Ω K−2 at 947 K for x = 0.02, which required x = 0.04 for the pentavalent dopant Ta. This indicates that Re7+ functions as an efficient phonon scattering centre. The maximum ZT value of 0.16(3) at 947 K for CaMn0.98Re0.02O3 was obtained, which is a two-fold increase from 0.085(10) of undoped CaMnO3 and is comparable to 0.15(3) of a similarly heavy and highly charged B-site doped CaMnO3, CaMn0.96Ta0.04O3. Overall, the results prove the effectiveness of heavy and heptavalent Re incorporation in improving the thermoelectric properties of CaMnO3.
