Nanorods of Sb2Se3 have been produced from a newly designed single-source precursor under assistance of ethylene glycol used as solvent without any surfactants or additives. The precursor, [(SbL2Cl2)Cl]2·(CH3)2CO, 1 (L represents N,N-dimethyl selenourea)], has been easily synthesized and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction and IR spectroscopy. The extensive network of NH–Cl bonds present in the crystal packing of the complex promoted the formation of Sb2Se3, leaving HCl in the reaction medium. The Sb2Se3 nanocompounds have been characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The mechanism of formation of Sb2Se3 has been proposed and rationalized on the basis of TEM and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) observations of the intermediates throughout the solvent-assisted growth and mass spectral analysis of the reaction mixture during the process.
1. Introduction
One-dimensional, nanostructural composite materials of group V–VI elements, which are highly anisotropic semiconductors and crystallize as layered structures parallel to the growth direction, have received significant attention due to their photovoltaic and thermoelectric properties. Among these semiconductors, Sb2Se3 is a layered structure with orthorhombic crystalline phase. It is a direct band gap semiconductor, having the potential to find applications in opto- and thermo-electric cooling devices1 and photoconducting devices.2
Many approaches have been proposed for synthesizing one-dimensional Sb2Se3. Some of the more notable examples are solvothermal methods,3surfactant or polymer-assisted hydrothermal techniques,4β-cyclodextrin-assisted solution methods,5 a microwave-assisted method,6 and a single-source precursor method.3e Among the various techniques, the solvothermal route gives rise to one-dimensional Sb2Se3 nanostructures. Furthermore, a solvothermal route having a single-source precursor possesses many advantages due to the mildness, safety, ease of separation, and eco-friendly nature of the process. Lu et al.3d reported the synthesis of Sb2Se3 nanorods under solvothermal conditions; however, the growth temperature of pure Sb2Se3 nanorods was required to be more than 130 °C. Recently, Chang et al.3e have demonstrated the solvothermal synthesis of nanorods from a single-source precursor Sb(Se2P(OiPr)3. However, this method requires long reaction times and high reaction temperatures. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop a new method that enables the facile synthesis of 1D Sb2Se3 nanostructures without the need of any surfactants or additives at low temperatures.
In this study, we have successfully synthesized Sb2Se3 nanorods having dimensions of 80–120 nm in diameter and 2.7–8.5 µm in length. This was achieved by adapting a solvent-assisted route from a newly synthesized single-source precursor, [(SbL2Cl2)Cl]2·(CH3)2CO, 1 in ethylene glycol without any surfactants and additives. The advantages of our developed method are the short reaction time of about 1 h and relatively low temperature (120 °C). In addition, the rod-like Sb2Se3 nanocompounds may furnish new opportunities for fundamental studies to explain the growth mechanism of newly shaped nanocompounds from single-source precursors without using any surfactants or additives. In comparison to other methods, this single-source approach is a more convenient process with respect to the ease of separation of the product, and it is also environmentally friendly. The precursor can be easily synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction study and used for the first time as a single precursor to synthesize antimony triselenide nanocompounds. To the best of our knowledge, we have demonstrated the first synthesis of a Sb2Se3 nanocompound from a single-source precursor with short reaction times in the absence of any surfactants or additives.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All the reagents and solvents were of analytical purity and were purchased from Aldrich-Sigma and Junsei Chemical, South Korea. All the chemicals were used without further purification.
2.2. Preparation of single precursor
A three-necked round-bottom flask equipped with a stirring bar was charged with N,N-dimethyl selenourea (265 mg; 1.754 mmol). The flask was degassed for 10 min and filled with nitrogen. Dichloromethane (60 ml) was added in order to dissolve the N,N-dimethyl selenourea. A solution of SbCl3 (200 mg, 0.877 mmol) in dichloromethane (60 ml) was added drop-wise over a period of 30 min to the reaction mixture with vigorous stirring. A yellow precipitate was observed to form. Stirring was continued for another 2 h followed by filtration through a Whatman filter paper. The precipitate was washed several times with dichloromethane. Subsequently, the precipitate was dissolved in a minimum volume of acetone and stored in a refrigerator until it crystallized. A yield of 95% was obtained. The observed melting point observed was 78 °C (decomposition). Anal. calc. for C15H28Cl6N8OSb2Se4: C, 16.11; H, 3.42; N, 10.02%. Found: C, 16.42; H, 3.49; N, 10.16%. IR (cm−1): 3293, 3197 (NH), 1622 (δ NH2), 1568 (CN).
2.3. Preparation of nanorod
The as-prepared precursor (200 mg) was placed in a three-necked round-bottom flask. The flask was degassed for 10 min and filled with nitrogen. Ethylene glycol (20 ml) was added via injection. The reaction mixture was then heated at 120 °C for 1 h. During the heating, a black precipitate was observed to form. The reaction was then cooled to room temperature, and the particles were collected by centrifugation, washed several time with ethanol and water, and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 4 h. The obtained powders were then used for characterization with XRD, TEM, and XPS spectral analysis.
2.4. Characterization techniques

Elemental analysis of the precursor was performed using a FISONS EA-1108 CHN analyzer. IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker EQUINOX 55 FT-IR spectrophotometer with the sample prepared by KBr pellets. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a shimadzu UV 2550 spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 500–1500 nm at room temperature. The single crystal X-ray diffraction was carried out on a Bruker SMART APEX II X-ray diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) and CCD area detector. The intensity data were collected in the π and ω scan mode, operating at 50 kV, 30 mA at 296 K.7 The data reduction was performed using the SAINT and SADABS programs.8 All calculations in the structural solution and refinement were performed using the Bruker SHELXTL program.9 The structure was solved by the heavy atom method and refined by full-matrix least-squares methods. All the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically; the hydrogen atoms were geometrically positioned and fixed with isotropic thermal parameters. The final electron density maps showed no significant difference. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were recorded using a JSM-6700F at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of antimony selenide nanorods were recorded using a FEI Tecnai G2 T-20S at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The TEM samples are prepared by placing a drop of dilute ethanol dispersion of Sb2Se3 on the surface of a 200-mesh carbon-coated copper grid. The EDS (Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) plots were obtained using the AMETEK Energy Dispersive Analysis System operating at 200 kV at a tilt angle of 15°. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was recorded using a Rigaku D/2200V diffractometer.
3. Results and discussion
The reaction between N,N-dimethyl selenourea, L and antimony(III) chloride in dichloromethane at stoichiometric molar ratios at room temperature produced a yellow complex of composition [(SbL2Cl2)Cl]2·(CH3)2CO, 1, in 95% yield. The complex is insoluble in dichloromethane, chloroform, and benzene but soluble in polar solvents.
The infrared spectrum of the complex (see ESI†) shows that the positions of the bands belonging to the ligand, L, differ appreciably from the positions of the bands of the free ligand.10 The complex spectra generally show two ν(NH) absorptions above 3000 cm−1. The shape of these bands depends on the hydrogen bonding network and on the solvent molecule enclosed in the crystal, the δ(NH2) absorption being shifted to high frequency by ca. 10 cm−1. The C–N stretching frequency of L undergoes a considerable up-field shift by ca. 17 cm−1 when complexed.
A single crystal of 1, suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction, was grown in acetone. The ORTEP plot of (SbL2Cl2)Cl in 1, with atomic numbering is shown in Fig. 1. The molecular structure of the complex consists of an antimony cation chelated with two L ligands and two chloride ligands and a free chloride anion in a 1:1 ratio. 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space groupFdd2 with Z = 8. Crystals of 1 contain some acetone interspersed as the clathrate solvent. The compound can be formulated as [(SbL2Cl2)Cl]2·(CH3)2CO. Two Se atoms from two ligands (L) and two Cl ligands were found to be coordinated to antimony in trigonal bipyramidal geometry. The two Sb–Se bond distances are 2.8908(4) Å [Sb–Se(I)] and 2.8514(4) Å [Sb–Se(II)], whereas the two Sb–Cl bond distances are 2.4504(8) Å [Sb–Cl(I)] and 2.4112(8) Å [Sb–Cl(II)]. The Se(I)–Sb–Se(II) and Cl(I)–Sb–Cl(II) angles are 166.19(1)° and 95.77(3)°, respectively. On the other hand, the mean value of 1.879 Å for the Se–C bonds compares well with the value of 1.90 Å calculated for the single Se–C sp2 covalent bond, whereas a partial double bond character must be attributed to the C–N bonds of the ligands, L. The Sb–Se–C angles (mean value 108.27°) suggest that the Se atom can be considered as sp3 hybridized. The amine group of one of the ligands is directed towards the free chloride anion while the amine group of the other ligand is directed to the opposite side. This conformation of ligands has a significant influence on the crystal packing structure and on the hydrogen bonding networks. Inspection of the contact distances indicates that each chloride anion is involved in three NH–Cl bonds: (a) Cl and amine of the same cation (b) Cl and amine of another cation and (c) chloride ligand and NH–Cl bond of the same cation. This means that there are two types of hydrogen bonding (intra and inter molecular) in the crystal lattice (Fig. 2). Crystal data are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and bond angles are displayed Table 2 and hydrogen bonds are given in Table 3.

Fig. 3 shows the XRD pattern of as-prepared Sb2Se3 at 120 °C in ethylene glycol. All diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the corresponding orthorhombic phase of Sb2Se3 having cell parameters a = 11.632 Å, b = 11.771 Å, and c = 3.981 Å, which are comparable with the values given in Powder Diffraction File No. 97-001-6680 (a = 11.62 Å, b = 11.77 Å, and c = 3.962 Å). No additional peaks related to impurities like Sb2O3 and Se were detected, indicating that the as-prepared nanocompounds are well crystalline and purely single-phase samples.

The size, structure, and morphologies of the as-prepared product were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 4b shows the FE-SEM image of the Sb2Se3 sample. Sb2Se3 crystallites display a rod-like morphology with dimensions of 2.7–8.5 µm in length and 80–120 nm in diameter. Fig. 5d shows the TEM image of a single nanorod. The corresponding electron diffraction pattern (Fig. 5e) was taken from a selected area of the Sb2Se3 nanorod. The spotty pattern indicates that the as-prepared samples are well crystallized. Fig. 5f shows a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the Sb2Se3 nanorod. The crystal lattice fringes are clearly visible and the observed lattice spacing of 0.397 nm is in agreement with the d value of (1 0 1) planes of the orthorhombic Sb2Se3 crystal lattice, which suggests that Sb2Se3 nanorods grow along the [0 0 1] direction. The composition of Sb2Se3 is characterized by EDX (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) analysis (Fig. 6), which shows that the atomic ratio of Sb:Se is 2:2.61 (Note that the Cu and C peaks arise from the copper carbon grid).

The chemical state and composition of the as-prepared Sb2Se3 nanorods were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 7 shows the typical survey spectrum of the nanocompound, confirming the presence of Sb and Se. The value of the binding energy was calibrated by C(1s) peak (281.69 eV) as the internal standard. Peaks at 526.69 eV and 51.69 eV, corresponding to Sb 3d and Se 3d binding energy, respectively, were observed. Since the position of Sb 3d binding energy is superimposed on that of O 1s binding energy, the peaks of Sb 4d were used to detect the binding energy of Sb and were found at 30.69 eV. These values are in good agreement with those reported in the literature.11 Peaks related to other impurities were not observed. The XPS results also supported the formation of Sb2Se3.

There are some protons in the single precursor for the hydrogen bonds between amine nitrogen and chlorides. The selenium atoms in 1 are directly coordinated to the antimony ion. The hydrogen bonds are promoted for the formation of antimony selenides leaving hydrogen chlorides in solution during the solvent-assisted process. The formation of Sb2Se3 nanorods may be explained as shown in Scheme 1 and 2. The decomposition of the single precursor is shown in Scheme 1, in which one ligand and one molecule, i.e., [(SbL2Cl2)Cl] and CH3COCH3 are omitted for clarity. A lone-pair electron from HOCH2CH2OH approaches the electron deficient carbon center of N,N-dimethyl selenourea (electrophilic site of the ligand) which is promoted by the release of HCl in solution. The C–Se bond is then cleaved followed by subsequent formation of an amide bond. Further cleavage of the organic ligand and release of chloride ion lead to the formation of SbSe2− species in the reaction medium. The SbSe2− species and other organic fragments are confirmed by mass spectral analysis (see ESI†). It has been reported that the chalcogenides of antimony give rise to a variety of complex building units, including Sb3Se63− (or SbSe2−), which has been identified as a secondary building unit in Sb2Se3.12 The SbSe2− ions in the reaction medium combining with each other lead to the formation of spherical amorphous Sb2Se3 (Fig. 4a and 5a), and precipitation of antimony selenide is the driving force for the reaction (Scheme 2). Under assistance of ethylene glycol used as solvent, small nanocrystallites of Sb2Se3 (nuclei or seeds) are generated on the surfaces of these amorphous particles, through a heterogeneous nucleation process (Fig. 5b). Subsequently, as a result of the solvent-assisted ripening, the growth occurs preferentially in an energetically favorable localized region with relatively high concentrations of amorphous Sb2Se3 through a solid–solution–solid formation mechanism.13 Thus, one small rod-like particle after another is created followed by diffusion to form a flower-like intermediate (Fig. 5c) and finally rod shaped nanocompounds (Fig. 4b and 5d). This spontaneous process occurs continuously until all the amorphous Sb2Se3 particles have been consumed, leaving behind phase pure nanorod-based products. In brief, under suitable solvent and temperature conditions, a well controlled decomposition rate of the single-source precursor and subsequent nucleation and growth rates of crystalline Sb3Se3 promote the preferential growth of Sb2Se3 nanocrystals and hence the formation of Sb2Se3 nanorods.

In solution-phase synthesis, without any surfactants or additives, the morphology of the final product is highly dependent on the anisotropic nature of the [Sb4Se6]n building blocks. The growth mechanism of these Sb2Se3 nanorods can be understood by studying the natural chemical character of antimony triselenide. Sb2Se3 is a highly anisotropic semiconductor having a layered structure parallel to the growth direction.4a,14 The growth direction is along the [001] (c-axis), which is confirmed by HRTEM observations. Therefore, the favourable growth into elongated crystals is highly influenced by the anisotropic Sb–Se atom chain or layer structure of the orthorhombic Sb2Se3.
We have also carried out the same reaction at 100 °C in ethylene glycol as well as 80 °C in ethyl alcohol. In both cases, nanorods are formed after 5 h and 24 h, respectively. However, unidentified impurities are observed in the XRD patterns of the final products. These results indicate that the reaction temperature needs to be ≥120 °C to prevent contamination of the final product.
The optical properties of the as-prepared Sb2S3 compound have been analyzed by absorption spectroscopy. The visible/near IR absorption spectrum (Fig. 8) shows that the absorption tail of the synthesized Sb2Se3 nanocompound reached to 1200 nm in wavelength of which the direct band gap energy of the Sb2Ss3 nanorods corresponds to ∼1.03 eV.15 This value of the as-prepared nanorod may have positive implications in the fabrication of a solar cell.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the viability of a rapid and eco-friendly solvent-assisted route for the synthesis of Sb2Se3 nanocompounds of orthorhombic phase, from a newly synthesized single-source precursor, [(SbL2Cl2)Cl]2·(CH3)2CO, in ethylene glycol under mild conditions without any surfactants or additives. The structure of the precursor has also been characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Formation of the nanorods requires reaction temperatures above 120 °C, to prevent contamination of the final products. We have also shown that the solvent, ethylene glycol, plays an important role in the formation of the rod-like products. The growth rates of the nanorods are along the [0 0 1] axis. The absorption spectrum of the Sb2Se3 sample exhibited an optical band gap energy of ∼1.03 eV, which may have potential to be exploited in the fabrication of thin films for solar energy conversion. The present synthetic route is also expected to provide an alternative method for the ease of preparation of Sb2Se3 nanocompounds with unique morphology. It may also be effective for the synthesis of other metal selenide 1D nanostructures.
