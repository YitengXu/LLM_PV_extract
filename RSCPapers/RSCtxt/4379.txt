    , Accepted 29th October 2018First published on 29th October 2018AbstractOn the basis of first principles calculations, we propose Pd3P2S8 monolayer and bilayer, two-dimensional semiconductors, whose layered bulk parent crystals are experimentally reported, as promising photocatalysts for the solar-driven oxygen evolution reaction. The monolayer is kinetically and thermodynamically stable and shows a small cleavage energy of 0.35 J m−2, suggesting that it can be prepared by exfoliation from its bulk material, and exhibits a direct band gap of 2.98 eV, which can be engineered by applying strain. The Pd3P2S8 bilayer is an indirect band gap semiconductor with a slightly smaller band gap of 2.83 eV. The photoexcited holes generate favorable driving forces for promoting the specific solar-driven O2 evolution reaction. The extraordinary electronic properties, pronounced light harvesting capability in the visible and ultraviolet regions and active surface sites render the Pd3P2S8 monolayer and bilayer as compelling 2D materials with interesting application potential for photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic water splitting.
Introduction
Photocatalytic water splitting is gaining increasing attention and has been considered as the most promising method for clean hydrogen production, as it has the simplicity of using the power of sunlight to split water without any contaminating by-products.1
The efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting is governed by the performance of photocatalysts and photoelectrodes, which generate electron–hole pairs by light irradiation and drive water splitting reactions. This requires semiconductors that possess an appropriate band gap, larger than the thermodynamic potential for water splitting (1.23 eV), and smaller than the upper bound of the visible solar spectrum (∼3 eV). Moreover, the band edges of the semiconductor are required to match water oxidation and reduction potentials. Many potential photocatalysts that meet these criteria have been extensively investigated.2,3 However, the performance of those semiconductors are usually inhibited by subsequent separation of holes and electrons,4,5 because the generated charges tend to recombine during migration inside the bulk structure. Decreasing the dimension of photocatalytic materials in nanostructured devices is becoming an efficacious way to reduce the bulk recombination and meanwhile decrease the cost.6 Possessing a large surface area and extensive open space, 2D materials with a thickness of one- or few-atomic layers,7–10 are promising candidates for solar water splitting. Upon irradiation, the electrons and holes generated on the thin-layer surface can allow water splitting reactions to occur immediately, without depending on a high carrier mobility for charge migration and separation.
2D semiconductors with a band gap of ∼2 eV, including transition metal dichalcogenide (e.g. MoS2) monolayers, phosphorene, etc. synthesized from well-developed exfoliation methods,11,12 are supposed to be promising photocatalysts.13–16 However, the poor water stability has stopped some 2D structures (e.g. phosphorene) from being pursued for real applications.17–19 Moreover, due to the high overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER),20,21 the inefficient light-driven conversion of water to O2 has significantly hindered their application. Although cocatalysts and heterojunctions can sometimes improve the performance,22,23 stable 2D semiconductors with an appropriate band structure and intrinsic catalytic properties to drive the OER are crucial for solar water splitting applications.
On the basis of first principles calculations, we propose here 2D semiconductors exfoliated from Pd3P2S8, a layered material that was synthesized and characterized in 1971,24 namely Pd3P2S8 mono- and bilayer, and examine the possibility of using it for effective photocatalytic oxygen evolution. We perform DFT and molecular dynamics calculations to study the thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of the monolayer. The possibility of exfoliating the monolayer from its bulk crystal is examined by simulating the cleavage energy. Via a dependable hybrid functional method, we examine the band structure of 2D Pd3P2S8 which turns out to be a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 2.98 eV for the monolayer and an indirect band gap of 2.83 eV for the bilayer, respectively. The band edge and band gap can be engineered by applying external biaxial strain, and the charge carrier mobility of the monolayer is about 26.32 and 19.33 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes and electrons, respectively. In particular, we simulate the specific OER process which can be effectively driven by photoexcited holes. With good stabilities, a low content of noble metal, an appropriate band gap and carrier mobility, pronounced light absorption and an oxidation driving force, we show that 2D Pd3P2S8 is a compelling photocatalyst for solar-driven oxygen evolution.
Computational details
By performing first-principles computations on the basis of DFT, as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP),25 we optimized the hexagonal lattices of Pd3P2S8. The projector-augmented plane wave (PAW) approach was used to describe the ion–electron interactions.26,27 The weak interactions in thin-layered and bulk structures were depicted by employing the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) involving the PBE functional with the Grimme van der Waals correction.28,29
The cleavage energy (Eexf) of Pd3P2S8 is estimated according to Ecleavage = (Eenlarged − E5L)/S5L(1)where, Eenlarged and E5L are the total energy of the exfoliated five layer (5L) and original 5L structures, respectively, while S5L is the surface area of Pd3P2S8 5Ls. A larger value of Ecleavage indicates more difficulties to exfoliate the monolayer from the bulk.
In order to avoid the interactions between neighboring images, we set the vacuum layer of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer, bilayer and 5Ls to be 25, 35 and 70 Å along the c direction, respectively. A convergence threshold of 10−4 eV in energy and 10−2 eV Å−1 for the force with the conjugate gradient method for geometry optimizations and a cutoff energy of 500 eV for the plane-wave basis set were adopted in all computations. The k-point mesh of the Brillouin zone was set to be 6 × 6 × 1 and 6 × 6 × 6 for geometry optimization of the hexagonal thin-layers and bulk structure, respectively. Phonon spectra were computed by using the phonopy code on the basis of density functional perturbation theory.30,31 The thermal stability of PdPX MLs was assessed by performing ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations at 500–1500 K using the VASP.
The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06) was employed to calculate their electronic properties.32 The vacuum potentials of thin-layers were taken as the potential energy at the edge of the vacuum layer.
In order to evaluate the light absorption abilities of PdPX, the imaginary part ε2(ω) of the dielectric function is calculated on the basis of the following equation:33 (2)
Here, c and v refer to the conduction and valence band states, respectively, and is the cell periodic part of the orbitals at the k-point k. We applied the GW combined with the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) to calculate light absorbance with or without electron–hole (e–h) interactions, which is implemented in the BerkeleyGW package.34 The BSE calculations within the Tamm–Dancoff approximation were carried out by computing the matrix elements of the BSE Hamiltonian with a 5 × 5 × 1 k-point mesh and then interpolating on a 11 × 11 × 1 mesh in which six valence bands and four conduction bands were considered.
The four-electron OER process is as follows: * + H2O → OH* + H+ + e(3) OH* → O* + H+ + e(4) O* + H2O → OOH* + H+ + e(5) OOH* → O2(g) + H+ + e(6)*, OH*, O*, and OOH* denote the bare surface and OH, O and OOH intermediate adsorbed surface, respectively. The intermediate steps are estimated by simulating the intermediate adsorption on a 2 by 2 supercell of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer, and spin-polarization has been considered for all calculations. Different surface sites were examined by comparing the adsorption energy of OH* to find the most favorable surface active site. The standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) model is used as a reference, and the potential for H+ + e− ↔ 1/2H2 was set to equilibrium with 0 V at pH = 0 vs. SHE.
The free energy (ΔGads*) for the different adsorbents (ads*) is calculated by considering the zero-point energy (ZPE) and entropy corrections, according to the following equation: ΔGads* = ΔEads* + ΔEZPE − TΔS(7)where T denotes the temperature of 298.15 K and ΔS represents the entropy change. The ZPE energy ΔEZPE and entropy correction ΔS are calculated by examining the vibrational frequency.
The reaction free energy ΔG for steps (3)–(6) at pH = 0 is defined as the difference between the final and initial states which is obtained by frequency calculations at T = 298.15 K, as described below: ΔG = ΔE + ΔZPE − TΔS(8)where ΔE, ΔZPE, and ΔS denote the DFT total energy difference, the ZPE energy difference, and the entropy difference between the reactants and the products, respectively.
The reaction free energy change at an applied potential U is expressed as: ΔG(U) = ΔG − eU(9)
It can be found that the higher the oxidation potential (Uox) provided by the photoexcited holes, the more negative the reaction free energy change. Thus, a high Uox is beneficial to facilitate the solar-driven OER process.
Results and discussion
Bulk crystal synthesis of Pd3P2S8, a purplish red solid mass with a layered structure (as shown in Fig. S1†), was reported in 1971, as it occurs simultaneously in PdPX (X = S or Se) synthesis.24 Pd3P2S8 crystallizes in a hexagonal lattice and thus shows a different structural configuration than PdPX. This configuration has a lower content of Pd (23 at.%) than PdPX (33 at.%). After a geometry optimization, the lattice parameters of bulk Pd3P2S8 are found to be a = b = 6.93 and c = 7.31 Å, respectively, which are in good agreement with the experimental results (Table S1†).24 At the HSE06 level of theory, we examined the band structure of bulk Pd3P2S8, which is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 2.67 eV (Fig. S1†), agreeing well with the experimentally measured value (for details see Table S1†).
In fact, previous experiments have explored the possibility of using bulk Pd3P2S8 as a photoelectrode to catalyze water splitting. However, due to the fact that the interatomic distance between the Pd sites of adjacent layers is large, poor carrier mobility through interlayers of bulk Pd3P2S8 was observed, which suppressed its performance for water splitting.35 Thus, as the water splitting reactions can only occur on the surface of the catalyst crystal, bulk Pd3P2S8 exhibited a low catalytic efficiency and utilization. Exfoliating the three dimensional bulk of Pd3P2S8 into a thin-layer structure will be a simple and efficient way to achieve an effective 2D photocatalyst. By using mono- or bilayer Pd3P2S8 as a photocatalyst, the poor carrier mobility will not be a limitation as the photoexcited electrons and holes can participate in the water splitting reactions once they are generated on the surface.
Geometry and stability of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer
The monolayer of Pd3P2S8 was obtained by isolating it directly from the bulk structure. After geometry optimization, the lattice parameters are found to be a = b = 6.97 Å, which is slightly larger (∼0.6%) than that of the bulk (Table S1†). As shown in Fig. 1a, the Pd atoms are coordinated in a square planar pattern by two PS4 tetrahedral groups. The oxidation states of Pd, P, and S in Pd3P2S8 are +2, +5, and −2, respectively, which add up to a charge balanced compound. The bilayer structure was also studied by isolating it from the bulk crystal and adopting the same stacking pattern as the bulk (Fig. 1b). After geometry optimization considering the van der Waals interlayer interactions, the lattice parameters of the bilayer were found to be same as those of the bulk.

The kinetic stability of the monolayer is assessed by examining the phonon dispersion. As shown in Fig. 1c, the phonon spectrum shows two linear and one parabolic acoustic branches, which is the typical shape of a stable 2D crystal. No imaginary phonon mode is found in the spectrum, demonstrating that the monolayer is kinetically stable. The highest phonon mode reaches up to ∼750 cm−1, implying the robustness of the PS bonds. The thermal stability of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer is further demonstrated by the Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulated annealing calculations. As shown in Fig. S2a–c,† the monolayer remains structurally intact at temperatures up to 1500 K after 10 ps and totally recovers to its initial structure after subsequent geometry optimization. The water stability of the monolayer is also examined, as it will determine the service life of the photocatalyst.36 As shown in Fig. S2d,† the structure remains stable after a first principles molecular dynamics simulation at 300 K for 10 ps, indicating that Pd3P2S8 is stable in water solution, which agrees well with the experimental investigation.35
As indicated by a previous experimental study, the interlayer interactions in bulk Pd3P2S8 are weak.35 Thus, it can be expected that the cleavage of the monolayer from the bulk is feasible. Indeed, the simulated cleavage energy, determined by simulated exfoliation of the monolayer and bilayer from a five-layer slab (Fig. 2), is 0.35 and 0.36 J m−2 for the monolayer and bilayer, respectively. Such small cleavage energies, comparable to that of graphene (0.37 J m−2)37 and smaller than those of many other 2D materials (e.g. 0.52 J m−2 for GeS38,39 and 1.09 J m−2 for Ga2N40,41), indicate that thin-layered Pd3P2S8 can be produced by using well-developed mechanical or chemical exfoliation methods.11,12

Electronic and optical properties of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer and bilayer
We then examined the electronic properties of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer. As shown in Fig. 3a, the monolayer is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 2.98 eV, which is slightly larger than that of the bulk (2.67 eV). Both the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) are located at the M point. The spin orbit coupling (SOC) effect is examined at the same level of theory, but shows a negligible effect on the band structure. Therefore, we did not consider the SOC effect in the following calculations unless stated otherwise. The bilayer shows an indirect band gap of 2.83 eV slightly lower than that of the monolayer, and the VBM and CBM are located at the K and Γ points, respectively (Fig. 3b).
 Fig. 3  Band structure of the monolayer (a) and bilayer (b) calculated by the HSE06 method with and/or without the SOC effect; (c) band edge and band gap variations of the monolayer with the increasing applied biaxial tensile and compressive strain in comparison with the redox potentials at pH 0. 
We rationalized the band edge alignment to uncover the capabilities of using the Pd3P2S8 monolayer and bilayer for photocatalytic water splitting. The VBM and CBM were corrected by applying vacuum level corrections and compared with the reduction (H+/H2) and oxidation (O2/H2O) potentials for water splitting at pH 0, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, Pd3P2S8 presents the CBM and VBM values of −4.39 and −7.37 eV for the monolayer, and −4.29 and −7.12 eV for the bilayer, respectively. Compared to the H2 reduction potential (−4.44) and the O2 oxidation potential (−5.67) at pH 0, it can be found that both the Pd3P2S8 monolayer and bilayer can facilitate the O2 evolution and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid solution. Moreover, the VBM position both in the Pd3P2S8 monolayer and bilayer is much lower than the water oxidation potential, implying that the photogenerated holes would provide a pronounced driving force for water oxidation.
The band gap and band edge alignment of the monolayer can be engineered by applying external biaxial strain. As shown in Fig. 3c, the band gap decreases with increasing the applied tensile strain, when the tensile strain increases to 5%, the band gap is reduced to be 2.91 eV. When compressive strain is applied, the band gap decreases more significantly and reaches 2.76 eV at −5%. Note that the monolayer is tuned to be an indirect-gap semiconductor by applying tensile strain while it remained as a direct-gap semiconductor at compressive strain until the compressive strain is increased to −5%, which induces the monolayer to be an indirect semiconductor. Therefore, applying biaxial strain can be an effective way to induce the direct–indirect gap transition. The strain-induced band edge shift is also significant. It can be seen that both the VBM and CBM of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer shift down with increasing the tensile strain, while they shift up with increasing the compressive strain. As a result, the band edges can be effectively tuned to match the oxidation and reduction potentials by applying external biaxial strain.
On the basis of deformation potential theory,42 we estimated the carrier mobility of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer along its zigzag and armchair directions for electrons and holes, respectively (Fig. S3†). As shown in Table 1, the carrier mobilities are found to be 26.32 and 19.33 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes and electrons along the zigzag direction, while they are 18.95 and 6.74 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes and electrons along the armchair direction, respectively, which are about one order smaller than those of the PdPS monolayer.16 This can be understood as the Pd3P2S8 monolayer presents a relatively porous configuration and possesses in-plane pores with a diameter of 4.45 Å, which result in a less effective carrier mobility in the plane. Although the in-plane pores reduce the charge carrier mobilities, they can serve as effective channels for the diffusion of molecules and protons in the solution, which will be rather favorable for water oxidization and reduction reactions. Moreover, as the specific water splitting reactions will take place on the surface from both sides of the monolayer, the moderate carrier mobility will still be opportune in facilitating the reactions.

To evaluate the light harvesting ability of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer and bilayer, an important factor for the performance of a photocatalyst, we calculated the absorbance of the materials. As the electron–hole interaction (exciton effect) plays a rather important role in the optical properties of 2D semiconductors, we computed the imaginary part of the dielectric function (ε2) of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer and bilayer by adopting the GW approximation and solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE), which incorporates the electron–electron and electron–hole interactions and hence can produce results in good agreement with experimental measurements.43–45 As shown in Fig. 4, the monolayer and bilayer show pronounced light absorption for the incident light from the in-plane direction, covering the visible and ultraviolet regions. The absorption coefficient reaches up to 106 cm−1, which is comparable to that of organic perovskite solar cells,46,47 indicating that the Pd3P2S8 thin layer possesses a good light harvesting capability. In addition, it is found that the monolayer shows multiple and broad optical peaks, while the peaks for the bilayer are relatively sharp and clean. This can be understood as the electron–hole Coulomb interaction in the monolayer is rather pronounced, which contributes to the red shift of the optical absorption spectrum. The exciton binding energy for the monolayer is determined to be about 0.60 eV as indicated in Fig. 4. In comparison, the exciton effect is significantly weakened in the bilayer due to the formation of a dielectric interface. In regard to these results, effective molecular or atom doping is supposed to be adopted to increase dielectric screening effects and facilitate exciton dissociation in the monolayer.48,49 Similarly, constructing a heterojunction structure with other 2D materials is also a possible solution to separate electrons and holes for subsequent reactions.50

The electronic gaps for the monolayer and bilayer are indicated by blue and pink arrows. The exciton binding energy (0.6 eV) for the monolayer is indicated by the difference between the optical and electronic gaps. 
Solar-driven oxygen evolution reaction
In order to gain more insights into the photocatalytic behavior of 2D Pd3P2S8 for O2 evolution, we simulated the OER process on the monolayer surface, which can be regarded as a four electron transfer process (as shown in eqn (3)–(6)), undergoing the deprotonation of water molecules at the surface. The adsorption energy of OH* on different surface sites is examined to identify the active sites. As shown in Fig. S4,† OH* is favorably adsorbed on the in-plane sulfur atom. This is reasonable as the charge distribution profiles (Fig. S5†) show that the CBM of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer is mainly contributed by the P orbitals of the in-plane sulfur atoms. The charge contribution from the dz2 and dx2−y2 orbitals of Pd is also considerable, whereas the steric effect resulting from the inner location of Pd atoms restricts the adsorption of the intermediate. Therefore, the OER is supposed to occur gradually above the in-plane S atoms.
The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) at the surface active sites at external potentials (Uox for photogenerated holes) was examined to identify the reaction pathway. As shown in Fig. 5a, Uox for the Pd3P2S8 monolayer is about 2.93 V, which will be the effective driving force to facilitate the water oxidation reaction. Fig. 5b shows the ΔG of the OER at different external potentials. Without irradiation (U = 0), the steps corresponding to the formation of OH*, OH* and O2 are exothermic while the second step corresponding to the formation of O* is endothermic. In agreement with previous studies,20,21 the first step is the controlling step of the OER. The overpotential for the first step is about 2.77 V, which can be easily overcome by the Uox (=2.93 V) that is provided by the photogenerated holes. At U = 2.93 V, all four intermediate steps of the OER become endothermic, indicating that the O2 gas can be automatically generated from acid water solution on the surface of the monolayer upon photo irradiation. As the bilayer also exhibits a high Uox of 2.67 V, it can work to catalyze O2 evolution as well. According to a very recent experimental study which showed that the electrochemical HER performance of Pd3P2S8 can be efficiently improved by electrochemical lithiation,51 we can expect a surface modification of the cocatalyst to be an effective way to facilitate full water splitting reactions.

U = 0 and 1.70 V (the potential difference between the VBM and the oxygen evolution (O2/H2O) potential) correspond to the value of the potential at open circuit without and with light irradiation. U = 2.77 and 2.93 V correspond to the overpotential for the OER and value of potential at equilibrium with light irradiation. 
Conclusion
In summary, we have shown that the Pd3P2S8 monolayer and bilayer are a stable 2D material with electronic and optical properties that are appropriate for photocatalytic oxygen evolution. The small cleavage energy (∼0.35 J m−2) that is comparable to that of graphene can definitely enable the exfoliation of the monolayer and bilayer from their bulk crystal. The monolayer shows a direct band gap of 2.98 eV which can be engineered by applying strain, while the band gap is slightly decreased to 2.83 eV for the bilayer. The moderate carrier mobility and pronounced light absorption ability of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer make it a good photocatalyst. An additional benefit for photocatalytic applications is the intrinsic porosity of the material with pores of ∼4.5 Å diameter offering effective transport of molecules and protons. Therefore, with a high porosity, open surface sites, and favorable photogenerated hole potential, the Pd3P2S8 monolayer and bilayer are predicted to be a compelling photoanode material to catalyze solar O2 evolution. However, it remains important to investigate the photo-induced corrosion effect52 in 2D Pd3P2S8 in detail. Introducing interfacial impurities, for example by surface doping and/or constructing heterojunctions, suggests possibilities to suppress the exciton effect and improve the photocatalytic performance in practical applications.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer (a) and bilayer (b) in a 2 by 2 supercell from the top and side views; the primitive unit cell is outlined by the red dashed line, and the Pd, P and S atoms are denoted by teal, purple and yellow balls, respectively; (c) phonon spectrum of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer.	 

 	Fig. 2  Cleavage energy of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer and bilayer with the increasing interlayer distance.	 

 	Fig. 3  Band structure of the monolayer (a) and bilayer (b) calculated by the HSE06 method with and/or without the SOC effect; (c) band edge and band gap variations of the monolayer with the increasing applied biaxial tensile and compressive strain in comparison with the redox potentials at pH 0.

 	Fig. 4  Computed imaginary part of the dielectric function of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer and bilayer by using the GW-BSE method for the light incident from the in-plane direction. The electronic gaps for the monolayer and bilayer are indicated by blue and pink arrows. The exciton binding energy (0.6 eV) for the monolayer is indicated by the difference between the optical and electronic gaps.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Scheme for the Uox of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer and bilayer for water splitting by comparing the energy level of the CBM with the water oxidation potential at pH 0; (b) Gibbs free energy change diagram of the OER on the surface of the Pd3P2S8 monolayer at pH = 0 and U = 0, 1.70, 2.77 and 2.93 V, respectively. U = 0 and 1.70 V (the potential difference between the VBM and the oxygen evolution (O2/H2O) potential) correspond to the value of the potential at open circuit without and with light irradiation. U = 2.77 and 2.93 V correspond to the overpotential for the OER and value of potential at equilibrium with light irradiation.
