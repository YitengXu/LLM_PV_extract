All of the compounds have good solubility in common organic solvents and large electron affinity (3.8–4.0 eV), comparable to those of BBL and PCBM. Perylene-based BBL derivatives more readily aggregate and show broad absorption.
Poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) was firstly reported by R. L. Van Deusen et al. in 1965.1 The double-stranded structure endows this polymer with excellent thermal and chemical stability.2 Upon doping by ion implantation, it changes from an insulator to a conductor.3 In addition, it exhibits good photoconductivity, large optical nonlinearity,4 and high electron affinity (∼4.0 eV).5 Solar cells made from spin-coated bilayer thin-film heterojunctions of BBL and PPV were found to have a photovoltaic charge collection efficiency as high as 49%. The power conversion efficiency was up to 2.0% at the peak wavelength.6 BBL is also the first reported n-channel FET active polymer with the electron mobility up to 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1.7 The extended conjugation in BBL resembles one-dimensional conjugated polymers and two-dimensional graphite sheets, which is believed to contribute to its unique properties.8 However, BBL is not melt processable and can only be solution processed by dissolving in sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid or Lewis acid/nitromethane solution, which makes the characterizations, processing and use of BBL quite difficult and troublesome.9
Although some BBL-like polymers were designed and synthesized, few of them exhibited a good processability and solubility while still keeping the essential ladder-type structure.10 Some small molecules that resemble a partial structure of BBL were prepared and showed good electronic properties, such as naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid bisbenzimidazole (NTCBI) suitable for use as thin films made by vapor deposition.11 Soluble NTCBIs are known but their structures and conjugation length are limited by the core size of aromatic diamines used in the synthesis.12 To date, there is no simple way to extend the length of ladder-like structure of these compounds along the long axis. To search for suitable n-type compounds, ribbon-like pyrazine-containing acenes were prepared but their LUMO levels (−3.8 eV) are higher than those of BBL (∼−4.0 eV) and PCBM (∼−4.2 eV).13  
Herein we report a simple and efficient route to the synthesis of soluble BBL-like compounds. The synthetic strategy involves the use of well-defined naphthalene- and perylene-containing double-stranded heterocyclic tetraamines as the building blocks. Conceivably, NTCBI can be functionalized to afford such a tetraamine building block (N-4NH2), which in turn is employed to construct BBL-like derivatives by further condensation with aromatic 1,2-diketones or anhydrides. By design, large twisted aryl and long alkyl pendent groups should be introduced at the lateral positions of the building blocks to impart the solubility to the target compounds.
As shown in Scheme 1, the tetraamine N-4NH2 was obtained in 85% yield by reduction of its precursor N1, which was synthesized by the condensation reaction between diamine 1 and naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride in m-cresol. The reduction of N1 was carried out in refluxing THF over RANEY® nickel catalyst under atmospheric hydrogen. Other reducing agents such as Zn/AcOH,14 NaBH4/CoCl215 or Mg/MeOH16 were also tested, but less effective than hydrogenation. Due to the presence of an electron deficient core, N-4NH2 is stable as a solid for weeks in air and could be readily purified by chromatography. Symmetric 1,2-diketones were chosen to react with N-4NH2 in order to avoid the formation of more structural isomers. Condensation reaction of N-4NH2 with phenanthraquinone and benzo[1,2-b:6,5-b]dithiophene-4,5-dione17 afforded naphthalene-core, BBL-like derivatives N2 and N3, respectively. Compounds N1, N2 and N3 show a good solubility (over 70 mg mL−1) in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, toluene and chlorobenzene.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of naphthalene-core, BBL-like derivatives N1–3 from N-4NH2. 
Encouraged by good solubility of these naphthalene-core, BBL-like derivatives, we decided to replace the naphthalene core with perylene. Thus, reaction of 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride with diamine 1 under the same conditions as for the synthesis of N1 gave perylene-core, BBL-like derivative P1 in 75% yield (Fig. 1). P1 was then successfully converted into tetraamine P-4NH2 by hydrogenation over RANEY® nickel. The condensation reaction between P-4NH2 and phenanthraquinone and benzo[1,2-b:6,5-b]dithiophene-4,5-dione afforded P2 and P3, respectively. Due to the large rigid structure, these perylene-core BBL-like derivatives are less soluble in common organic solvents than the naphthalene-core derivatives. Compound P2 has the lowest solubility but could still be dissolved in chlorobenzene up to a concentration of 40 mg mL−1 at room temperature. All the compounds could be cast or spin coated to form thin films on glass or ITO substrates. Compounds N1–3 and P1–3 were characterized by NMR, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. They are a mixture of cis/trans isomers; only the isomers of P2 and P3 could be separated successfully by chromatography. The isomers of P2 and P3 have almost the same absorption spectra (Fig. S7†) but different DSC traces (Fig. S4†). With the NMR and MS data, the complete assignment of each isomer of P2 and P3 is still impossible, because the aromatic proton signals are broadened and overlapped. The 1H NMR spectra of compounds N1 and P1 with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 in CDCl3 at room temperature are well resolved (Fig. S10 and S16†). The aromatic proton signals of N2, N3, P2 and P3 are broadened, presumably due to molecular aggregation in solution. At high temperatures, the NMR peaks become sharp and distinct (Fig. S1†).
 Fig. 1  Perylene-core, BBL-like derivatives P1–3 from P-4NH2. 
The DSC traces of N1 and P1 display an endothermic transition during the first heating scan but no peaks during the cooling and the second heating run. The DSC of compounds N2 and N3 did not show any transitions. In contrast, each isomer of compound P3 has a pair of reversible phase transitions (Fig. S4†); the less polar isomer of compound P2 has a pair of reversible phase transition peaks and the more polar isomer only exhibits one endothermic peak during the first heating run. The DSC studies indicate that the perylene-core BBL-like derivative P3 and the less polar isomer of P2 have strong intermolecular interaction and are more easily to pack into an ordered structure than other BBL-like derivatives.
The optical properties of these compounds were investigated in solution and as thin films. Perylene-core compounds P1–3 absorb more intensely than the naphthalene-core analogs from 500 nm to 800 nm in chloroform (Fig. 2, top). The absorption spectra of spin-coated thin films of P1–3 exhibit a bathochromic shift over 100 nm in comparison with their spectra in solution, indicating a strong tendency to aggregate in the solid state. It is worth noting that the absorption spectra of thin films of P1–3 cover the entire visible spectral region and extend into the near-infrared region. In contrast, the absorption spectra of N1, N2 and N3 in dilute solution and in thin films are quite similar and therefore they are much less aggregated in the solid state. We have also investigated the UV-vis absorption of these compounds in different solvents (Fig. S6†). The absorptions of P1–3 show a bathochromic shift in less polar CCl4. Their spectra are also broadened distinctly and very similar to the absorption spectra of the films, indicating that these compounds are easily to aggregate in less polar solvents. Meanwhile, these compounds also exhibited a tendency to aggregate with the increase of the concentration in toluene (Fig. S5†). No emission bands were detected for all these compounds.

The electrochemical properties of these compounds were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S2†). All the compounds undergo an irreversible oxidation and multiple reduction processes. The latter is mainly attributed to the electron-deficient imidazole, pyrazine or thiadiazole units. The onset redox potentials and HOMO, LUMO energy levels are summarized in Table 1. The LUMO levels of these compounds are all localized below −3.8 eV and comparable to those of BBL (−4.0 eV) and PCBM (−4.2 eV), suggesting their high electron affinity and a potential for use as n-type materials.

In conclusion, by rational design, a series of BBL-like derivatives with good solubility and high electron affinity are made available using two new tetraamines as building blocks. The perylene-core P1–3 are more readily to aggregate and show a broad absorption in the visible and NIR region, suitable for use in organic photovoltaic and electronic devices.
