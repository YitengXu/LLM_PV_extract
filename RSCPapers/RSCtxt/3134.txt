    , Accepted 18th September 2016First published on 19th September 2016AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, well known for their potential as the next generation solar cells, have found another niche application in optoelectronics. This was demonstrated in a recent experiment (L. Dou, et al., Science, 2015, 349, 1518) on atomically thin (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4, where, due to quantum confinement, the bandgap and the exciton binding energy are enhanced over their corresponding values in the three-dimensional bulk phase. Using density functional theory we show that when halogen atoms (e.g. I) are sequentially replaced with superhalogen molecules (e.g. BH4) the bandgap and exciton binding energy increase monotonically with the superhalogen content with the exciton binding energy of (C4H9NH3)2Pb(BH4)4 approaching the value in monolayer black phosphorus. Lead-free admixtures (C4H9NH3)2MI4−x(BH4)x (M = Sn and Ge; x = 0–4) also show a similar trend. Thus, a combination of quantum confinement and compositional change can be used as an effective strategy to tailor the bandgap and the exciton binding energy of two-dimensional hybrid perovskites, making them promising candidates for optoelectronic applications.
Introduction
Perovskites with the formula AMX3 (A and M are metal cations and X is an anion) have been of great interest to scientists since their discovery in 1839. Much of this interest is due to the fact that they can not only be synthesized using a solution-based method but also their composition can be varied widely. Perovskites are multifunctional materials with an impressive range of interesting properties such as superconductivity, giant magnetoresistance, spintronics and catalytic properties. The recent discovery that CH3NH3PbI3 can serve as an efficient solar cell material has heightened the interest in the study of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.1–7 Their potential as the next generation solar cell material is due to a combination of attractive properties such as tunable bandgap,8 large optical absorption,2 small exciton binding energy,9,10 very long carrier diffusion lengths,11 and solution-based synthesis.1 The meteoric increase in the power conversion efficiency of perovskite-based photo-voltaic devices from 3.8%1 in 2009 to 20%12,13 today makes them the “next big thing” in solar cells.
The use of organic–inorganic perovskites has now gone beyond the solar cells, extending their applications to other important fields such as lasing,14 field-effect transistors,15 and photoluminescence devices.16–18 The recent breakthrough in synthesizing high-quality atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskites BA2MX4 (BA: butylammonium, C4H9NH3; M = Pb; X = I, Br) by the solution-phase growth method4 furthered the use of these materials in nanoscale optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes (LED). The above 2D structure consists of corner-sharing [MX6]4− octahedra capped by intervening layers of organic cations, as shown in Fig. 1a. The layer of long organic chains is insulating, while the inorganic layer is semiconducting, effectively creating a quantum well (QW) super-lattice. Due to the quantum confinement effect caused by reduced dimensionality, these materials transition from free-carrier to excitonic behavior at room temperature. With a corresponding increase in the exciton binding energy from tens of meV to hundreds of meV and blue to purple light emission, 2D hybrid perovskites are preferred for LED and photoluminescent applications.9 The color of the emitted light can be readily tuned by changing the thickness or/and halogen-composition of the 2D materials.

In this paper, we propose a new route for tailoring the bandgap and exciton binding energies of 2D hybrid perovskites by sequentially replacing the halogens with molecular units that mimic the chemistry of halogens but are not composed of them. The molecular analogues of halogens are known in the literature as superhalogens19 whose electron affinities are larger than those of halogens and can be tuned by controlling their composition. There has been a recent experimental study on synthesizing more than 30 new stable perovskites by replacing halogen (Cl, Br, I) with superhalogen BH4−.20 Very recently, two of the authors of the current paper showed that 3D hybrid perovskites can be viewed as superalkali halides where the alkali cations and halogens anions are replaced by their molecular equivalent, namely superalkalis, such as [CH3NH3]+ and [HC(NH2)2]+, and superhalogens [MX3]− (X = halogen).21 It was also shown that a new class of hydride-based hybrid perovskites with controlled bandgaps can be created by replacing halogen with superhalogen BH4−. We note that the ionic radius of BH4− is almost identical to that of Br− in hybrid perovskites.21 The bonding ionicity between the organic cation and the [M(BH4)3]− anion is also very similar to that between the same cation and the [MI3]− anion. The hybrid perovskites with BH4− show increased bandgap due to the fact that the energy corresponding to the valence band maximum (VBM) of BH4− is derived from the hybridized B 2p and H 1s orbitals, which are much lower in energy than the valence shells of halogen atoms. Here, we follow a similar procedure for the 2D hybrid perovskites BA2PbI4−xBrx but we use the superhalogen BH4− instead of Br−. Thus created 2D materials are expected to have larger bandgaps and, therefore, larger exciton binding energies than the corresponding halogen-based materials. We also explored lead-free analogues of the 2D materials. In the following, we systematically study 2D BA2MI4−x(BH4)x (M = Ge, Sn, Pb; x = 0–4) for their thermal stability and electronic and excitonic properties.
Computational methods
The geometry and electronic structures of BA2MI4−x(BH4)x (M = Ge, Sn, Pb; x = 0–4) are computed using density functional theory (DFT) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerholf (PBE) functional for the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).22,23 Structures are relaxed without any symmetry constraint with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. Convergence criteria of energy and force are set to 1 × 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. DFT-D2 correction of Grimme24,25 is used to account for the van der Waals interactions between organic layers. Reciprocal spaces are represented by the Monkhorst–Pack special k-point scheme26 with 3 × 3 × 1, 5 × 5 × 1, and 7 × 7 × 3 grid meshes for structure optimization, self-consistent field (SCF) and density of states (DOS) calculations, respectively. Band structures are calculated with and without spin–orbit coupling (SOC). Effective masses at the bands’ extrema are calculated using the finite difference method with a step size of 0.01 Bohr.27

Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of hybrid perovskites are performed at the GGA-PBE level of theory embedded in the VASP. A 2 × 2 × 1 supercell containing 880 atoms is used for each simulation. During simulation, both the size and shape of the cells are allowed to change under ambient conditions within the NpT ensemble. The tolerance of the SCF cycle is set to 1 × 10−5 eV. A time step of 1 femtosecond (fs) is chosen. We allow 1 picosecond (ps) for the system to reach thermal equilibrium and then collect atomic trajectory data every 10 fs for 4 ps.
All cluster calculations are carried out using the Gaussian 03 software package.28 The cluster structures are optimized until they reach the energy minimum without imaginary frequencies. HOMO–LUMO gaps are calculated using the second order Møller–Plesset perturbation (MP2)29 theory and the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set. Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT)30 with the Becke three parameter Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP) functional31,32 is used to compute the ultraviolet-visible spectrum. The optical gaps are obtained as the first peak with non-zero oscillator strength in the spectrum.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1b shows the crystal structure of BA2M(BH4)4 (M = Ge, Sn, Pb). Similar to the structure of BA2MX4 (X = halogen), each metal ion is octahedrally coordinated to six BH4− units. The neighboring octahedra share the vertices and rotate against each other. The lattice parameters of BA2Sn(BH4)4 and BA2Ge(BH4)4 simulated under ambient conditions by AIMD after the thermal equilibrium is reached (see Fig. S1 in the ESI† for the simulated free energy) are shown in Fig. 1c and d, respectively. These results confirm the thermal stability of these materials in a tetragonal crystal system.

Fig. 2 shows the calculated electronic density of states and band structures of BA2M(BH4)4 (M = Pb, Sn, Ge). The partial DOS for each material shows that the valence band maximum (VBM) is composed of hybridized metal s (Pb: 6s; Sn: 5s; Ge: 4s), B 2p and H 1s orbitals of the BH4− superhalogen. The conduction band minimum (CBM) is derived from the metal p orbitals (Pb: 6p; Sn: 5p; Ge: 4p). These results are similar to those in BA2PbI4, where the VBM originates from the Pb 6s and I 5p and CBM is composed of Pb 6p orbitals. Details are also shown for the partial charge density of VBM and CBM in ESI Fig. S2.† All the studied materials show a direct bandgap at the Γ point. For BA2Pb(BH4)4, the SOC reduces the gap by about 1 eV33 due to the lowering of the Pb 6p orbital. However, for BA2Sn(BH4)4 and BA2Ge(BH4)4, the effect of SOC is negligible. Similar behavior of SOC has been observed in their counterparts with I and Br and also in 3D hybrid perovskites. It has been known that, on the one hand, SOC will lower the Pb 6p band, reducing the bandgap, while on the other hand, a strong relativistic effect of Pb will lower its s band, increasing the gap by about the same amount. A PBE gap of 2.09 eV (see ESI Fig. S3†) of BA2PbI4 without SOC and relativistic effect is fortuitously in good agreement with the experimental value of 2.24 eV.34 However, the calculated PBE bandgaps of BA2Sn(BH4)4 and BA2Ge(BH4)4 should be underestimated, as there will no longer be any fortunate cancellation of errors. It should also be noticed that, with SOC correction, CBM of each BA2M(BH4)4 (M = Pb, Sn, Ge) shows a splitting against k around the Γ point. This is the so-called Rashba effect, caused by the breaking of centrosymmetry in the crystal structures due to the substitution of halogen by BH4−.

Band structures without (left panel) and with (right panel) SOC of (b) BA2Pb(BH4)4, (d) BA2Sn(BH4)4 and (f) BA2Ge(BH4)4. Γ = (0, 0, 0), X = (0.5, 0, 0), S = (0.5, 0.5, 0), Y = (0, 0.5, 0), R = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), Z = (0, 0, 0.5). 
Another feature of the band structure is that the dispersions along the R–Γ–Y and R–Z–Y directions have mirror symmetry. This is due to the insulating character perpendicular to the inorganic layers, resulting in a flat band along the Γ–Z direction. The electrons and holes are well confined in the inorganic layers. Our results show that 2D perovskites are ideal quantum well (QW) structures and BH4 substitution does not destroy the host materials’ QW feature. Effective mass analysis of VBM and CBM further proved our conclusion. Table 1 shows the calculated hole and electron effective masses along the Γ–X, Γ–Y and Γ–Z directions in BA2PbI4−x(BH4)x (x = 0–4). For BA2SnI4−x(BH4)x and BA2GeI4−x(BH4)x the effective masses are given in ESI Table S1.† As discussed before, the VBM arises from B and H, where SOC is non-effective. However, Pb contributes to the CBM of BA2PbI4−x(BH4)x (x = 0–4), and SOC is therefore important for the position and shape of the CBM. Our results show that, compared to the results without SOC, the electron effective mass with SOC tends to be smaller, especially in the case of BA2Pb(BH4)4. Also, with SOC, the effective mass of the electron does not increase much from x = 0 to x = 4. This suggests that the negative impact on the electron effective mass caused by replacing I with BH4 is limited. Most of the hole and electron effective masses along Γ–X and Γ–Y are smaller than those of the free electron mass, m0. Both hole and electron effective masses along Γ–Z are infinite, which shows the QW characteristic of 2D hybrid perovskites.

The bandgap and exciton properties of admixtures BA2MI4−x(BH4)x (M = Pb, Sn, Ge) are also examined. For BA2Pb(BH4)4 (BAC4H9NH3), there are 220 atoms in its unit cell. (There are 4 formula units BA2Pb(BH4)4 in one unit cell of the crystal.) Calculations using functionals such as HSE and GW would provide more reliable absolute values of the bandgap of the material, but greatly surpass our computing capacity. On the other hand, according to our previous study on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, we can (at least roughly) estimate the bandgap of the bulk hybrid perovskites by using cluster models.35 The method is that, in admixtures of AMX4−xYx (A = organic cation; M = metal; X = halogen 1, Y = halogen 2), the variation of the bandgap from x = 0 to x = 4 can be estimated from the variation of the fundamental gap of the corresponding cluster model AMX4−xYx. The validity of the method is based on the following. First, the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB) of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites originate from the HOMO and LUMO of the cluster model, respectively. The expansion of the HOMO (LUMO) to VB (CB) can be explained by using a tight-binding model with the molecular cluster as the building block.35 Second, the method has been tested by comparing the estimated bandgaps from the cluster model to the experimental values36–41 in 3D hybrid perovskites, as shown in ESI Table S2.† Third, we consider the studied 2D hybrid perovskites as the special case of 3D hybrid perovskites with a quantum well character along one crystal dimension. Although the lack of experimental bandgaps of admixtures BA2MX4−xYx (M = metal; X = halogen 1, Y = halogen 2; x = 0–4) prevents us from testing the method in a more general fashion, the case study in BA2PbI4−xBrx where experimental bandgaps are available for x = 0, 2, 4 does give us confidence in our prediction, as shown in ESI Fig. S4.† For x = 2, the bandgap estimated from the cluster model is 2.68 eV (BA2PbI4 experimental bandgap 2.41 eV plus cluster model predicted gap change from x = 0 to x = 2, 0.27 eV) compared to the experimental value of 2.46 eV, the relative difference being about 9%. For x = 4, the value from the cluster model is 3.10 eV (BA2PbI4 experimental bandgap 2.41 eV plus cluster model predicted gap change from x = 0 to x = 4, 0.69 eV) compared with the experimental value of 3.05 eV, the relative difference being about 2%. Although the bandgap values estimated from the cluster model for the admixtures BA2MI4−x(BH4)x (M = Pb, Sn, Ge; x = 0–4) are expected to give the correct trend, more accurate values of the bandgaps obtained from experiments are desirable.
We first calculated the fundamental gaps of the cluster models of the admixtures BA2MI4−x(BH4)x (M = Pb, Sn, Ge). For each case of M = Pb, Sn and Ge, we calculated the fundamental gap variations when x = 1–4 against x = 0. Then by adding these variations to the experimental bandgap of BA2MI4 (M = Pb, Sn, Ge), the bandgaps of BA2MI4−x(BH4)x for x = 1–4 were estimated. The cluster model we used for the studied admixtures is shown in Fig. 3a. We have normalized all the gaps of BA2MI4 (bulk and cluster, M = Pb, Sn, Ge) to 0 to highlight the gap change, as shown in Fig. 3b, c and d (see also ESI Fig. S5†). The relative change of the PBE (w/o SOC) bandgaps of bulk materials and the corresponding MP2 HOMO–LUMO gaps of clusters versus x from 0 to 4 agree quite well. With the I atom gradually substituted by BH4, the bandgap of the admixture gradually increases, as shown in Table 2. Especially when x ≤ 2, all the bandgaps fall in the range of the visible spectrum. When x ≥ 3, the gaps extend to the violet and ultraviolet regions. The relatively large bandgaps of the studied 2D hybrid perovskites are not suitable for visible light absorption, which makes them less attractive as solar cell materials. However, for application in other optoelectronic devices, such as LED, the color of emitted light is also important. For this reason, 2D hybrid perovskites may be useful. For the experimentally synthesized 2D hybrid perovskites, such as BA2PbI2Br2 and BA2PbBr4, the light emission is from blue to purple, corresponding to bandgaps in the range of 2.5–3.2 eV.4 For the studied 2D hybrid perovskites with BH4, most of the estimated bandgaps based on the experimental values of BA2PbI4, BA2SnI4 and BA2GeI4 fall in the range of 2.0–3.2 eV, as shown in Table 2. Also, these 2D hybrid perovskites may be applied as photoluminescent materials, where the excitation source is usually invisible light, such as ultraviolet.

In the Wannier model, the exciton binding energy is inversely proportional to the square of the dielectric constant of the material, which becomes smaller for larger bandgaps due to lower screening upon excitation. Therefore, it is possible to establish an empirical relationship between the exciton binding energy and the bandgap of semiconductors with direct bandgaps. In 3D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, we have been able to establish such a relationship by fitting to the available experimental data. The exciton binding energies estimated from the empirical relationship for the 3D hybrid perovskites agree well with the experimental data.35 Here, by fitting to the data of the exciton binding energy and the fundamental gap of the studied clusters and a number of 2D hybrid perovskites42,44,45 (see Table S3†), we obtain the following relationship between the fundamental gap (Eg) and the exciton binding energy (Eb):35 (1)As shown in ESI Fig. S6† the quality of the fit is excellent, suggesting that eqn (1) can provide a good description of the relationship between the exciton binding energy and bandgap. The exciton binding energy in the cluster model is calculated as the difference between the HOMO–LUMO and optical gaps. The bandgap of BA2Pb(BH4)4 is the sum of the experimental gap of BA2PbI4 (2.24 eV) and the gap change (1.54 eV) calculated using the PBE + SOC results in Fig. 3b. With the empirical relationship eqn (1), we can use the predicted bandgaps of the BA2M(BH4)4 to estimate the exciton binding energy of these materials. The results are shown in Table 2, and are 780, 767 and 463 meV for M = Pb, Sn, Ge, respectively. The highest exciton binding energy is comparable to the 900 meV value of monolayer black phosphorus reported recently.46 So we come to the conclusion that the bandgap and the exciton binding energies of hybrid perovskites can not only be increased by reducing the dimensionality but also by replacing halogens (e.g. I) with superhalogen moieties (e.g. BH4), thus extending the functionality of hybrid perovskites beyond solar energy conversion.
Conclusions
In summary, a systematic theoretical study of 2D BA2MI4−x(BH4)x (M = Ge, Sn, Pb; x = 0–4) hybrid perovskites shows that replacement of halogens with superhalogens can increase the bandgap and exciton binding energies much, as seen from the lowering of dimensionality. Thus, quantum confinement can be combined with compositional change of BA2MI4 hybrid perovskites to create materials with improved optoelectronic properties. In particular, the exciton binding energy of BA2Pb(BH4)4 is close to that of monolayer black phosphorus. The potential of these hybrid perovskites for optoelectronic and photoluminescent applications, in addition to efficient photovoltaic devices, makes these materials a fertile ground for physicists, chemists, and material scientists.
