    , Accepted 9th October 2022First published on 11th October 2022AbstractElectrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to valuable organic compounds and fuels using energy efficient techniques is presently of great importance. In this work, we show the synthesis of Al2O3-decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) electrocatalysts and their catalytic properties for the conversion of CO2 into formate. These hybrid nanostructured materials are prepared using chemical synthesis, followed by chemical vapor deposition. The materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, and the results confirm the formation of γ-Al2O3 on defect-rich rGO. Transmission electron microscope images reveal the formation of γ-Al2O3 with particle sizes of 8 ± 0.3 nm on rGO sheets that are ∼100 × 100 nm in length and width and composed of a few-layers of graphene. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the presence of Al–O, C–C and C–O bonds in the material. The amount of Al is ∼2.8%, as determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The material catalyzes the electrochemical reduction of CO2 at a potential of −0.434 V vs. RHE in 0.5 M KHCO3 solution, which is used as an electrolyte. The potential dependent bulk electrolysis shows that the reduction product is formate, which formed with a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 31.90, 37.25, 42.50, 55.10 and 91.20% at potentials of −0.434, −0.534, −0.634, −0.734 and −0.934 V vs. RHE, respectively. Based on these findings, these noble metal-free electrocatalysts may find industrial applications to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals, and thereby to mitigate CO2-related global warming issues.
Introduction
Energy crises and global warming are currently among the major obstacles to sustainable societal development worldwide. The projected total energy demand in 2050 is expected to be two-fold higher than what it was in 2019. Although fossil fuels, which include coal, petroleum and natural gas are relatively inexpensive and energy-dense natural resources, their incessant consumption is gradually depleting these natural energy resources.1 Moreover, their use has been increasing the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere and causing a grave greenhouse effect and global warming. Thus, it is important to develop new and alternative ways to generate energy and thereby lower fossil fuel use.2
The possible ways to do so include the conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals and synthetic fuels using biocatalysts,3 chemical and thermal transformation methods,4 CO2 hydrogenation under high pressure and in the presence of various reagents,5 and photocatalytic and electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions.6 Many of these methods, which can recycle CO2, involve CO2 adsorption, activation and transformation steps. However, not only do they require enormous amounts of thermal energy, high H2 pressure or chemical reagents to activate the stable CO2 molecule but they also unfortunately take place with low transformation rates. Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, in contrast, has the following three major advantages: (i) it can be applied directly for practical use under thermodynamically favorable (electron and proton transfer) experimental conditions; (ii) it is more environmentally friendly; and (iii) it allows for product selectivity by applying the right potential, temperature, solvent, electrolyte or electrocatalyst. Moreover, the potential needed for the electrocatalytic transformation of CO2 can be derived from non-fossil fuel-based energy sources, such as wind power, solar energy, and hydroelectricity.7
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 can give various products or a mixture of products, including formate (HCOO−), carbon monoxide (CO), methanol (CH3OH), and methane (CH4), depending on the number of electrons and protons transferred at the electrified interface during the reaction.8 For example, Hori et al. showed that the faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO2 reduction, which is a measure of electrocatalytic activity and the product selectivity of the electrocatalytic reaction, was highly dependent on the type of electrolyte used, the types and stability of intermediate species formed in the reaction, and the nature of the catalyst used.9 Although noble metals such as Rh and Pd can electrocatalyze CO2 reduction,10 these catalysts have low FE values toward desirable products because of their inherent ability to also catalyze the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at nearly similar cathodic potentials.
The activity of solid-state electrocatalysts depends considerably on the atomic size, oxidation state, and chemical nature of the atoms involved. Nanostructured electrocatalysts possess a large surface area-to-volume ratio, many surface atoms with large surface energy, high reactivity, and tunable spatial/quantum confinement effects. Due to these properties, nanomaterials not only display distinct chemical, physical, and surface properties compared to their bulk/molecular counterparts but are also more active as electrocatalysts.11 Recently, an excellent review on various nanostructured metals, metal oxides and carbon materials that show good catalytic activities for electrochemical reduction of CO2, their advantages for electrocatalysis, and the different factors affecting their activities and FE values of the different products formed over them was published by Hou et al.12
Formic acid and formate, which are among possible CO2 reduction products, are widely used for agricultural and pharmaceutical applications, in organic synthesis, and in the food and textile industries. They can also serve as an easier and safer medium to store and deliver H2 generated by water splitting reactions for fuel cells.13 Both of them can be accessed via electrochemical reduction of CO2 that involves 2-electron and 2-proton transfer processes and a CO2− intermediate at the electrified interfaces.14,15 However, getting only these products with CO2 electroreduction is not straightforward. Several transition metal-based electrocatalysts have been investigated for the selective conversion of CO2 into formate. For example, White and Bocarsly reported that indium oxide, indium hydroxide and metallic indium nanoparticles could catalyze the electrochemical reductive conversion of CO2 into formate.16 Due to their higher surface area and density of surface exposed active sites, such nanoscale materials unsurprisingly show significantly enhanced activity compared to their bulk counterparts. Chen and Kanan studied the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on thin films of Sn/SnOx electrodes in an aqueous NaHCO3 supporting electrolyte.17 These SnOx thin film-based systems displayed 8-fold higher fractional current density and nearly 4-fold greater faradaic efficiency (FE) for electrocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 as compared with a Sn film electrode. While other nanostructured systems, such as Hg-based amalgam, Sn@Bi nanoparticles17,18 and Pb and polytetrafluoroethylene electrodes19,20 have been reported for CO2 reduction and formate formation, many of them suffer from surface poisoning, higher overpotentials, etc.
Meanwhile, two-dimensional (2D) materials have recently attracted much attention because they enable the dispersion of metal nanoparticles and prevent their aggregation, giving stable heterogeneous nanocatalysts. Graphene oxide (GO) is a notable 2D material that has bonds composed of sp2 and sp3 hybridized carbon atoms and a planar network with high mobility of π-electrons available for binding with other agents. GO also contains oxygen-based functional groups such as hydroxyls, epoxides and carbonyls on its surfaces, and these groups make GO hydrophilic and dispersible in water.21 GO has been used as a support material for catalysis and electrocatalysis applications, including electrochemical hydrogenation of CO2.22–28 For example, Fischer et al. used graphene nanoribbons as support materials for Au nanoparticles, and the resulting materials were found to electrochemically catalyze the hydrogenation of CO2 to CO with 90% FE at −0.2 V vs. RHE.29 Zygmunt et al. synthesized ZnO-supported graphene for activation of CO2 and studied the effect of the support material on the rate of CO2 reduction.30 Meyer et al. reported graphene-supported Sn nanoparticles that could electrochemically reduce CO2 to a formate product in aqueous NaHCO3 electrolyte with a 93% FE.31 These materials showed high catalytic activity due to the synergetic effects and strong interaction between their constituents. Kimura et al. prepared different Cu-based gas diffusion electrodes using ZnO, ZrO2, TiO2, Al2O3, and Nb2O5 as support materials and found that the products formed from the reactions would depend on the types of metal oxide support materials used.32
So far, only very few studies have been reported on Al-based electrocatalysts for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into useful products. Biswal et al. reported γ-Al2O3- and ZSM-5-supported Sn for electrocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to methane.33 Notably, they studied a 20 wt% Sn electrocatalyst loaded on γ-Al2O3 and ZSM-5, and they found that the porous walls of γ-Al2O3 would give more faradic current with a high yield of methane than those of ZSM-5. Al2O3 could do so because it enabled Sn to disperse better, forming less agglomerates, than ZSM-5. Very recently, the stability of γ-Al2O3-supported SnO2 during the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate was reported.34 The support material (i.e., γ-Al2O3) prevented the etching of Sn, increasing the stability of the supported SnO2 nanoparticles and helping them retain their size, morphology and crystallinity. However, the electrochemical activity, selectivity and FE (65%) of the γ-Al2O3-supported SnO2 electrocatalyst are still low, even after 152 h-long electrolysis.
Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of Al2O3-decorated reduced graphene oxide (Al2O3-rGO) via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). We also show that this hybrid material exhibits electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogenation of CO2 (CO2 reduction) in aqueous KHCO3 electrolyte. The product of the reaction is formate, as confirmed with HPLC, and it formed with FE values of 31.90, 55.10, and 91.20% at potentials of −0.434 V, −0.734 V, and −0.934 V vs. RHE, respectively.
Experimental
Chemicals
Aluminium chloride (AlCl3) (Sigma-Aldrich), graphite powder (99.99%, Alfa-Aesar), sulphuric acid (98% Alfa-Aesar), nitric acid (78% Alfa-Aesar), potassium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich), acetone (99.99% Alfa-Aesar), CO2 gas (99.99%) and hydrazine hydrate (N2H4) (99.99%) (Vijay Scientific Ltd, India) were procured and used as received. Deionized water was used for all synthetic work and electrochemical studies.
Synthesis of GO, reduced GO (rGO) and Al2O3-rGO
GO was synthesized from graphite powder using the modified Hummer's method.21–28 Briefly, in a round-bottom flask, 0.5 g of graphite powder was mixed with 100 mL of acidic solution containing concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4 (3:1), and the mixture was stirred in an ice bath for 45 min. The dispersion was then sonicated for 3 h in an ultra-sonication bath. It was subsequently refluxed for 24 h. It was then diluted with distilled water and filtered. The solid product was redispersed in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to remove unreacted graphite. The solution was filtered again, and the solid product was washed with acetone. The precipitate was dried in an oven at a temperature of 60 °C for 2 h to remove the solvent and any other volatile substances. Then, 0.5 g of the product, which is GO, was taken and mixed with hydrazine hydrate (2–5 mL), and the mixture was stirred for 2 h. The dispersion was filtered, and the solid material was washed copiously with deionized water and then ethanol. It was dried giving rGO. rGO was used to synthesize the nanocomposite materials as follows.
To synthesize Al2O3-rGO, first rGO and AlCl3 were mixed in a 1:1 ratio by weight using a mortar and pestle. The mixture was kept in a CVD furnace and treated at 600 °C in an Ar atmosphere for 2 h, followed by treatment in an H2 atmosphere for 3 h. The formation of Al2O3-rGO nanocomposite material was confirmed by various physicochemical characterization techniques. The synthetic procedure leading to Al2O3-rGO, along with the electrocatalytic evaluation of the material, is schematically illustrated in Scheme 1.

The synthesis involves the preparation of GO, followed by reduction of its surface oxides to form rGO, and finally the decoration of the surfaces of rGO with Al2O3. 
Fabrication of Al2O3, rGO and the Al2O3-rGO-modified electrode and electrocatalytic studies
All electrochemical studies were performed using a CHI-660E potentiostat (CH-instrument, USA) and a three-electrode cell comprising a saturated calomel (SCE) reference electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and a working electrode. The working electrode is comprised of glassy carbon (GC) with a diameter of 3 mm that contains each catalyst. Before depositing the catalyst on it, the GC electrode was cleaned by polishing it with 1.0, 0.3 and 0.05 μm-sized Al2O3 powders, followed by washing it with water and methanol to remove inorganic and organic impurities, respectively. A calculated amount (0.01 mg) of Al2O3, rGO or Al2O3-rGO in 1 mL isopropanol was sonicated for 40 min. The catalyst ink was then drop-casted on the active area of the GC. The resulting Al2O3, rGO and Al2O3-rGO-modified GC working electrode was used for electrochemical and electrocatalytic studies. As an electrolyte, an aqueous solution of KHCO3 (0.5 M) was used. N2 gas was bubbled into the electrolyte for 30 min to remove dissolved O2, and then CO2 gas was bubbled into it for 40 min to saturate it with CO2. The electrochemical data collected using SCE were converted into the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the following equation (eqn (1)): VRHE = VSCE + 0.2412 + 0.059 pH(1)
The pH here, which refers to that of the electrolyte after CO2 saturation, is 7.2.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the materials were obtained using a Rigaku-Ultima IV fully automatic high-resolution X-ray diffractometer equipped with an X-ray generator operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. The measurements were performed in a step of 0.01° (2θ) at room temperature. Raman spectroscopic analysis of the materials was performed with a Raman spectrometer that is equipped with a microscope (Seki Technotron Corporation) and a 532 nm laser. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a SPECS HSA-3500 instrument that is equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray radiation source and that has a hemispherical analyzer. The XPS results were used to investigate the elemental states of the samples. The morphologies and sizes of the as-prepared hybrid materials were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The amount of Al in Al2O3-rGO was determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The samples for it were prepared via digestion of 10 mg of materials with aqua regia (HCl/HNO3 solution). The data were used to calculate the elemental composition of the materials.
Results and discussion
Al2O3-rGO is synthesized with a two-step synthetic procedure involving the chemical immobilization of Al3+ ions into rGO, followed by heat treatment/chemical vapor deposition (CVD), as illustrated in Scheme 1. The material is characterized by various methods. First, the XRD patterns of Al2O3-rGO and the parent material GO are obtained to compare the phases and crystallinity of their components. The XRD pattern of rGO (Fig. 1a) shows the typical diffraction peaks of the (002), (101) and (110) planes of graphitic carbon.35 While the XRD pattern of Al2O3-rGO shows similar peaks, the peaks are shifted to higher angles (by 2θ of ca. 0.30°). It also shows additional Bragg peaks corresponding to the (200), (222), (400) and (440) planes of the γ-phase of Al2O3, in fair agreement with what is reported for this material in the literature. Not surprisingly, the peaks in the XRD patterns appear broader, most likely due to their small particle sizes.36
 Fig. 1  Superimposed (a) XRD patterns of (i) rGO and (ii) Al2O3-rGO. The results indicate that the latter has γ phase Al2O3. (b) Raman spectra of (i) rGO and (ii) Al2O3-rGO. The ratio of intensities of the peaks associated with the D and G bands (ID/IG) of rGO is 0.68, and the one for Al2O3-rGO is 0.91 (or five-times higher after Al2O3 nanoparticles are incorporated in rGO). 
To determine the degree of defect sites in the graphene structures of rGO, before and after decoration with Al2O3, the Raman spectra of rGO and Al2O3-rGO are obtained (Fig. 1b). Their superimposed spectra show weak bands at ∼110, ∼189 and ∼274 cm−1 that can be attributed to Al2O3. The peaks are weak because Al2O3 is present in the nanosized form or in a small amount. The peak observed at ∼1345 cm−1 in the spectra is due to a D-band, indicating the presence of some disordered structure in the graphene sheet. The peak observed at ∼1571 cm−1 is a G-band corresponding to the graphitic structure in rGO. The ratio of intensity of the two bands (ID/IG) for rGO is 0.68. The one for Al2O3-rGO is much higher (0.91). This means that the ID/IG ratio increases after the decoration of rGO with Al2O3 indicating the formation of more defect structures in it compared with the pristine one. Moreover, a shift to negative values (by ca. 5.9 cm−1) of both the D and G bands of Al2O3-rGO compared with those of rGO might be due to the change in the electronic structure of rGO after its decoration with Al2O3 nanoparticles.37
Next, the morphologies and structures of the as-synthesized nanocomposite materials are studied using TEM. The result is shown in Fig. 2. The image shows that the rGO sheet has a size of ca. ∼100 nm × 100 nm and is decorated with Al2O3. Al2O3 particles are quasi-spherical in shape and have an average size of 8 ± 0.3 nm (see the particle size distribution curve shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI†).
 Fig. 2  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Al2O3-rGO. The average size of Al2O3 particles on the 100 nm-size nanosheet of rGOis 8 ± 0.3 nm. The inset shows a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of an individual Al2O3 nanoparticle on the rGO nanosheet. 
The as-synthesized Al2O3-rGO is then characterized by XPS (Fig. 3). The full survey XPS spectrum shows the presence of C, O and Al (see Fig. 3a). The deconvolution of the C 1s peak gives four bands indicating the presence of different oxidized carbon species and defect sites in the material (Fig. 3b). The intense peak at 284.8 eV represents asymmetric C–C groups, the peak at 286.01 eV is related to C–O–C groups, the one at 287.2 eV can be ascribed to CO and the peak at 288.8 eV is associated with the atoms in CC bonds.38 The XPS spectrum of Al of Al2O3-rGO is depicted in Fig. 3c and exhibits two peaks at 74.4 eV and 75.20 eV associated with 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Al in the +3 oxidation state, which correspond to Al2O3. Meanwhile, the peak observed at a binding energy of 73.3 eV corresponds to metallic Al.39 The deconvoluted spectrum of the core level O 1s is shown in Fig. 3d. It shows a peak at 530.5 eV, which corresponds to the Al–O bond; a second peak at 531.1 eV, which is associated with O–H functional groups; and a third one at 533.1 eV, which is due to CO species.40 The XPS results collectively confirm that the composite material has Al2O3 and rGO. The presence of these two materials together is found to impart synergetic electrocatalytic effects to effectively drive CO2 reduction reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface to specific intermediates such as *OCHO species (vide infra).

(b) XPS spectra C 1s core electron deconvoluted into four different species (C–C, C–O–C, CO and CC). (c) XPS peaks of Al 2p core–shell levels (2p3/2 and 2p1/2).

Moreover, the amount of Al in Al2O3-rGO nanocomposite material, which is determined by ICP-MS, is ∼2.8%. The data observed have been incorporated in Fig. S2 in the ESI.
Next, cathodic current versus potential curves are obtained for the catalyst and the relevant control materials. The studies are done using 0.5 M KHCO3 saturated with N2 or CO2 gas as an electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 and in a potential window of 0.668 to −0.934 V vs. RHE. The studies include cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), chronoamperometric measurements (i–t) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). For a better comparison, the LSV curves of Al2O3-rGO obtained in solutions saturated with N2 gas and CO2 gas are overlaid in Fig. 4a, (i) and (ii). The LSV curves, shown in Fig. 4a, reveal that the electrochemical reduction of CO2 over Al2O3-rGO takes place at an onset potential of −0.434 V vs. RHE. This value is lower as compared with those of the other electrocatalysts, namely, Al2O3 NPs, rGO, and bare GC, denoted in Fig. 4a, as (iii), (iv) and (v). Besides, the current density obtained for the former is higher. The higher current density and lower onset potential obtained in a CO2 environment for Al2O3-rGO indicate its viability as a catalyst for efficient electrochemical reduction of CO2.41
 Fig. 4  (a) Superimposed LSV curves obtained at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 for electrochemical reduction of CO2. Prior to the experiments, the electrolyte is bubbled with N2 gas (for 30 min) to remove dissolved O2, followed by with CO2 gas (for 40 min) to saturate it with CO2, except for the control experiment in (ii), where only N2 gas was bubbled. The experiments are done over (i) Al2O3-rGO in KHCO3 solution (0.5 M) bubbled with N2 and then CO2, (ii) Al2O3-rGO in KHCO3 solution (0.5 M) saturated only with N2 gas, (iii) Al2O3 bubbled with N2 and then CO2, (iv) rGO saturated with N2 and then CO2, and (v) bare GC in 0.5 M KHCO3 solution bubbled with N2 and then with CO2. (b) Nyquist plots for CO2 reduction at an applied potential of −0.848 V vs. RHE over (i) Al2O3-rGO hybrid nanocomposite in a solutions bubbled with N2 and then with CO2, (ii) Al2O3 bubbled with N2 and then with CO2, (iii) rGO bubbled with N2 gas and then with CO2, and (iv) bare GC in 0.5 M KHCO3 bubbled with N2 and then with CO2. 
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and Nyquist plots for the materials are then obtained. Impedance measurements indirectly signify the kinetics of electrochemical oxidation–reduction reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces and help to determine the electroactivity of materials.42 In Nyquist plots, smaller semicircles indicate more facile electron transfer processes, based on the Ohm's law.

Fig. 4b shows the EIS plots obtained at an applied potential of −0.848 V vs. RHE for (i) Al2O3-rGO hybrid nanocomposite material, (ii) Al2O3, (iii) rGO, and (iv) bare GC in KHCO3 electrolyte bubbled with N2, and then with CO2. The results indicate that Al2O3-rGO has the lowest resistivity (with a value of Rct = 21.5 Ω) compared with Al2O3 (with Rct = 26.1 Ω), rGO (with Rct = 28.6 Ω), and bare GC (with Rct = 58.3 Ω). Furthermore, Fig. S3 in the ESI† shows an equivalence circuit model and corresponding evaluated electrochemical resistance values for (a) bare GC electrode @9.62 Ω, (b) Al2O3 NP modified GC electrode @8.3 Ω, (c) rGO modified GC electrode @5.46 Ω and (d) Al2O3-rGO modified GC electrode @2.73 Ω hybrid nanocomposite with an EIS plot. These results indicate that Al2O3-rGO has a relatively greater conductivity and ability to transfer electrons during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.
To examine the stability and the potential of Al2O3-rGO catalyst to reduce CO2 on a large scale, chronoamperometric (i–t) measurements at different applied potentials using KHCO3 solution (0.5 M) as a supporting electrolyte are carried out. The results are displayed in Fig. 5a. In the experiments, the potential is kept constant for a particular period of time. The changes observed in the electrocatalytic reduction reaction of CO2 are quantified, based on the product determined by HPLC analysis. It is worth noting here that formate is found to be the product of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. As the potential is shifted towards the cathodic side, the current density of the reaction significantly increases. Based on the potential-dependent HPLC data analysis, shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), for example, at potentials of −0.434, −0.534, −0.634, −0.734 and −0.934 V vs. RHE, the amounts of formate obtained in 3600 s are 0.01 mM, 0.025 mM 0.031 mM, 0.040 mM, and 1.269 mM respectively. Not surprisingly, the current density and the formation of formate are significantly increased by applying a more negative potential.
 Fig. 5  Bulk electrolysis performed for 3600 s over (a) Al2O3-rGO at potentials of (i) −0.434 V, (ii) −0.534 V, (iii) −0.634 V, (iv) −0.734 V and (v) −0.934 V vs. RHE in KHCO3 electrolyte bubbled with N2 and then with CO2. (b) The values of FE obtained at applied potentials of −0.434, −0.534, −0.634, −0.734 and −0.934 V vs. RHE are found to be ∼31.90, 37.25, 42.50, 55.10 and 91.20%, respectively. (The observed spikes in the current density are caused by the disturbances at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to CO2 gas bubbles as well as possible H2 bubbles generated by the competitive HER, which is common during experiments involving CO2 reduction). 
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 is further quantified with faradic efficiency (FE), which is determined using the following equation (eqn (2)): FEHCOO- = N × F × nHCOO × 100%/QTotal(2)where F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1); N is the number of electrons required to form the product, i.e., 2 for a formate molecule (HCOO−); t is the electrolysis time; and Q is the quantity of electric charge (Q = J × t, where J is the current in ampere).43
Bulk electrolysis is carried out over Al2O3-rGO in 0.5 M KHCO3 saturated with CO2 solution in the potential range of −0.434 V to −0.934 V vs. RHE while CO2 is continuously being bubbled into the electrolyte solution. The result, which is shown in Fig. 5a, indicates that, as the applied potential is turned towards more negative values, the current as well as the amount of formate formed in the reaction increases. Importantly, three processes may simultaneously take place at the working electrode, namely: (a) the generation of formate and its desorption into the supporting electrolyte, (b) mass transfer of CO2 from the bulk to the electrode via diffusion and (c) a competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Again, the adsorption of CO2 at the active sites of Al2O3-rGO via diffusion from the bulk, followed with desorption of formate, can take place continuously. From the observed curves, it can be said that the modified electrode is highly stable at all applied potentials (in the range of −0.434 V to −0.934 V vs. RHE). In the case of the applied potential −0.934 V vs. RHE, the observed fluctuations in current density could be because, at a more negative potential, the rate of cathodic reactions is comparatively high (both CO2 reduction and the HER). Hence, the bubbles of H2 form, grow and desorb due to the HER, which can simultaneously take place at the electrode/solution interfaces, resulting in such fluctuations (Fig. 5a(iii)). The results obtained for the potential-dependent FE study are shown in Fig. 5b. The values of FE at applied potentials of −0.434 V, −0.534 V, −0.634 V, −0.734 V and −0.934 V vs. RHE are found to be ∼31.90, 37.25, 42.50, 55.10 and 91.20%, respectively. The data also show that, as the potential is shifted towards more negative values, the current density increases significantly. This could be due to the transfer of relatively more electrons at the electrified electrode–electrolyte interface of Al2O3-rGO.
The bulk electrolysis product at different specific potentials (in the range of −0.434 V to −0.934 V vs. RHE) is confirmed by HPLC. For reference, a standard run is performed in HPLC. The results are displayed in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† A peak corresponding to formate product at around 15.9 to 16.1 min is observed in HPLC and confirmed based on a reference standard used. Furthermore, different amounts of formate are produced at different potentials, as can be seen in Fig. S4.†
To determine the performances of individual electrocatalysts towards formate formation, bulk electrolysis is carried out on rGO at an applied potential of −0.934 V vs. RHE under saturated N2 followed by under CO2 in 0.5 M KHCO3 supporting electrolyte. Formate is produced with an FE of 39% (see the i–t profile and efficiency graph in Fig. S5 in the ESI†). The error bar of electrochemical results and data has been included in Fig. S6 in the ESI.† Based on these results, the main portion of the product formed at the Al2O3-rGO interface is formate and the remaining is due to the HER.
Finally, a possible mechanism by which Al2O3-rGO electrocatalyzes CO2 reduction with high performance and a large value of FE toward the formate product at a lower overpotential is proposed. From TEM of the material, shown in Fig. 2 earlier, Al2O3 particles present on rGO have small quasi-spherical sizes with corners and edges, which are known to serve as active sites for catalysis. Al2O3-rGO has catalytically active Al2O3 sites with small sizes, and thus a large density of sites to interact with CO2 species. Their edges have high co-ordination sites and thus better ways to bind CO2 and electrochemically reduce it at the electrode's surfaces. For example, Mbah et al. discussed various transition metals for electrochemical reduction of CO2 and H2S splitting reactions.44 The surfaces and morphological modifications created on the materials due to calcination render the materials with enhanced electrocatalytic performance and greater stability in the redox reactions. With this in mind, and using information from the literature detailed below, the electron transfer processes and the formation of intermediates and products over Al2O3-rGO are proposed as shown in Scheme 2.
 Scheme 2  Schematic representation of a possible reaction mechanism of CO2 reduction over Al2O3-rGO producing formate. 
Zuttel et al. reported the electrochemical reduction of CO2 over a 3D indium oxide (In2O3) cathode that led to formate via electron transfer from the electrode modified porous structure. This electrocatalyst gave only formate, indicating that the reaction proceeds via a two-electron transfer process and through CO intermediate. Again, the formation of formate is governed by *OCHO intermediate formed during the CO2 reduction reaction, as concluded by insights obtained from theoretical insight studies, whereas the formation of CO is dictated by *COOH intermediate. We thus believe that the same mechanism applies here as Al and In are in the same group and have a stable +3 oxidation state and lower electronegativity than C.45 In particular, the formation of *OCHO species as an intermediate, via the approach of O from CO2 towards the Al2O3-rGO electrocatalyst, which possesses less energy for product formation from intermediates and is also analogous to the adsorption configuration of other transition metal ions like Sn and In.46 Moreover, the literature indicates that Al enhances the kinetics related to electrochemical reduction of CO2 rather than the HER due to its low affinity towards hydrogen whereas other metals such as Pd have a high affinity towards hydrogen and thus suppress the CO2 reduction.47 In addition, Phania et al. reported the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formate by a related material, B-doped graphene.48 DFT calculations revealed that rGO and boron would introduce more surface area with asymmetric charge density, which is responsible for adsorption of CO2 and its subsequent conversion to formate.48
The highest adsorption energy reported for the formation of formate product via an electrochemical reduction of CO2 is for boron-doped graphene, which has a structure analogous to our Al2O3-rGO system.48 Moreover, the performance of the present catalyst is compared with various reported electrocatalytic systems from the literature including carbon-supported Bi nanoparticles,49 carbon black supported SnO2,50 and Sn-based gas diffusion electrode prepared by placing Sn on Nafion-bonded carbon black.51 The data, which are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI,† indicate that Al2O3-rGO is a better electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction than many previously reported systems. This could be due to the synergistic cooperative interactions between Al2O3 and rGO, since pure Al2O3 and rGO did not catalyze the reaction that well on their own.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated the synthesis of Al2O3-rGO via a simple chemical synthetic procedure that involved the preparation of rGO, followed by CVD of AlCl3 on rGO in an inert atmosphere. Structural and morphological characterization indicated the successful decoration of rGO with Al2O3 nanoparticles with 8 ± 0.3 nm in size. The amount of Al in the material, as analyzed by ICP-MS analysis, was found to be ∼2.8%. The material showed very good electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogenation or reduction of CO2, and its good catalytic activity was attributed to the synergetic effects between Al2O3 nanoparticles and the underlying support material (i.e., rGO). The onset potential for the reaction was −0.434 V vs. RHE in aqueous KHCO3 electrolytes. Additionally, potential-dependent bulk electrolysis showed that the reduction product was formate, which formed with a faradaic efficiency (FE) of ∼31.90, 37.25, 42.50, 55.10 and 91.20% at potentials of −0.434, −0.534, −0.634, −0.734 and −0.934 V vs. RHE, respectively. The Nyqiust plots showed that Al2O3-rGO had good electron transport properties. This material, which is composed of earth-abundant elements, could be viable for large-scale conversion of CO2 into valuable products while helping reduce global warming.

 	Scheme 1  Illustration of the synthetic procedure used to produce Al2O3-rGO electrocatalyst for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate. The synthesis involves the preparation of GO, followed by reduction of its surface oxides to form rGO, and finally the decoration of the surfaces of rGO with Al2O3.

 	Fig. 1  Superimposed (a) XRD patterns of (i) rGO and (ii) Al2O3-rGO. The results indicate that the latter has γ phase Al2O3. (b) Raman spectra of (i) rGO and (ii) Al2O3-rGO. The ratio of intensities of the peaks associated with the D and G bands (ID/IG) of rGO is 0.68, and the one for Al2O3-rGO is 0.91 (or five-times higher after Al2O3 nanoparticles are incorporated in rGO).	 

 	Fig. 2  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Al2O3-rGO. The average size of Al2O3 particles on the 100 nm-size nanosheet of rGOis 8 ± 0.3 nm. The inset shows a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of an individual Al2O3 nanoparticle on the rGO nanosheet.	 

 	Fig. 3  X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of Al2O3-rGO. (a) Full XPS survey spectrum showing signals corresponding to Al, O and C. (b) XPS spectra C 1s core electron deconvoluted into four different species (C–C, C–O–C, CO and CC). (c) XPS peaks of Al 2p core–shell levels (2p3/2 and 2p1/2).

 	Fig. 4  (a) Superimposed LSV curves obtained at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 for electrochemical reduction of CO2. Prior to the experiments, the electrolyte is bubbled with N2 gas (for 30 min) to remove dissolved O2, followed by with CO2 gas (for 40 min) to saturate it with CO2, except for the control experiment in (ii), where only N2 gas was bubbled. The experiments are done over (i) Al2O3-rGO in KHCO3 solution (0.5 M) bubbled with N2 and then CO2, (ii) Al2O3-rGO in KHCO3 solution (0.5 M) saturated only with N2 gas, (iii) Al2O3 bubbled with N2 and then CO2, (iv) rGO saturated with N2 and then CO2, and (v) bare GC in 0.5 M KHCO3 solution bubbled with N2 and then with CO2. (b) Nyquist plots for CO2 reduction at an applied potential of −0.848 V vs. RHE over (i) Al2O3-rGO hybrid nanocomposite in a solutions bubbled with N2 and then with CO2, (ii) Al2O3 bubbled with N2 and then with CO2, (iii) rGO bubbled with N2 gas and then with CO2, and (iv) bare GC in 0.5 M KHCO3 bubbled with N2 and then with CO2.

(b) The values of FE obtained at applied potentials of −0.434, −0.534, −0.634, −0.734 and −0.934 V vs. RHE are found to be ∼31.90, 37.25, 42.50, 55.10 and 91.20%, respectively. (The observed spikes in the current density are caused by the disturbances at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to CO2 gas bubbles as well as possible H2 bubbles generated by the competitive HER, which is common during experiments involving CO2 reduction).
