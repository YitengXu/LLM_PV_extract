    , Accepted 15th September 2016First published on 15th September 2016AbstractTwo new polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with orthogonal imide groups have been synthesized and characterized. These semiconductors have strong electron affinities with an electron mobility of up to 1.75 cm2 V−1 s−1 in solution-processed single-crystalline microfibers.
Rylene dyes containing two six-membered electron-withdrawing imide rings (rylene diimides) are currently the most employed electron acceptor materials due to their chemical accessibility, high stability, and high electron affinity.1 It is in fact well known that perylene diimides (PDIs) and naphthalene diimides (NDIs) have served as some of the most important building blocks to construct n-type semiconductors for organic devices.1c–e These rylene diimide materials have been extensively modified at the N-imide positions by alkyl chains, which affect the solubility and thin-film morphology, as well as at lateral positions by aromatic or heteroaromatic rings, which could significantly alter the electronic structures and charge transport behaviors.1,2
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have proven to be one of the most important semiconductors due to their relatively high charge-carrier mobilities.3 However, particular attention has recently been paid to embedding multiple imide groups into PAHs to construct new semiconductor materials with unique optoelectronic properties.4 The strong π–π interaction between PAH cores in cooperation with electron-deficient imide groups can facilitate the creation of new n-type PAHs with high electron affinity and solubility, as well as high electron mobility, for utility in organic electronics. Moreover, the modulation of the alkyl chains at imide positions provides numerous potential options to control and optimize the molecular self-assembly in the solid state. Indeed, this functionalization strategy paves a new way to n-type nanographenes.4a,c,f Recent advances have led to new PAHs bearing multiple imide groups that show impressive device performance (Fig. 1). For example, we have recently demonstrated that the lateral positions of PDIs and NDIs can be efficiently expanded to afford a series of rylene diimide arrays, which show electron mobilities of up to 4.65 cm2 V−1 s−1.4a,5 Nuckolls et al. reported a promising class of helical conjugated oligo(PDIs) as electron acceptors for organic solar cells with power conversion efficiencies over 8%.6 Very interestingly, Wudl et al. have reported the synthesis of decacyclene triimides by regioselective Friedel–Crafts carbamylation.7 The large π-surface and alkyl chain at the imide position were reported to be critical for their self-assembling properties. In a very recent report, Würthner et al. have successfully synthesized a planar C64 nanographene with tetraimides at four corners by one-pot reaction.8 Inspired by these works, herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a new class of n-type semiconductors by functionalization of one-dimensional polyacene with orthogonal tetraimides (Fig. 1). We expect that the relatively large π-surface can be beneficial for strong intermolecular π–π interaction, and the orthogonal imide groups, on the one hand, can provide access to polyacene with high electron affinity and, on the other hand, provide an opportunity to functionalize the molecular structures at different directions to tune molecular packing conformations.
 Fig. 1  Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with multiple imides. 

Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of PAHs with tetraimides. Our synthetic strategy involves the metal-catalyzed intermolecular and intramolecular cross-coupling reactions to form new C–C bonds, and has been demonstrated as one of the most useful methodologies to construct PAHs.9 We have previously shown that a simple Stille cross-coupling reaction between NDI and PDI derivatives could create fused PDI–NDI arrays via formation of six-membered rings.10 In this work, we report the lateral expansion of NDI by annulation with naphthalene diimides via five-membered rings. We first prepare the intermediates (3a, 3b) by Stille coupling reaction between distannyl naphthalene diimides 111 and dibrominated naphthalene monoimide 2. It should be noted that a significant improvement in the yield of intermediates is observed when CuI is included as an additive.12 Subsequently, the intermediates are capable of undergoing intramolecular C–H/C–Br coupling reaction to form the final products (4a, 4b) with five-membered rings in the presence of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) with a PdCl2(PPh3)2 catalyst in dimethylacetamide (DMA) at 160 °C. Compound 4b is slightly soluble and recrystallized in toluene, while 4a with branched alkyl chains is more soluble in solvents, such as chloroform, THF, and toluene, and purified on a silica column. The molecular structures of all oligomers were unambiguously characterized by MALDI-TOF, NMR, etc.

We investigate the influence of multiple imides on the optical and electrochemical properties of different acenes. The absorption spectra of C8-NDI10 and compound 4a in dichloromethane are shown in Fig. 2A and electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1. The peak of 4a with strong absorption at around 415 nm is characteristic of π–π* transition, which is a red shift of 35 nm with respect to that of C8-NDI due to the extended core conjugation. Meanwhile, the lowest optical band peak at around 467 nm is observed, leading to a smaller optical energy gap, which is 0.7 eV lower than that of C8-NDI. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were performed in dichloromethane with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, and onset oxidation potentials were determined relative to Fc/Fc+ (4.8 eV). The CV of 4a exhibits five well-defined, quasi-reversible reduction waves with half-wave reduction potentials at −0.65, −0.98, −1.22, −1.54, and −1.76 V and no reduction peak was observed (Fig. 2B). According to the onset potential, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was estimated at −4.2 eV, which is 0.4 eV lower than that of C8-NDI. This indicates that there is some strong electron communication between the four imide groups and the higher electron affinity can be attributed to the addition of two electron-withdrawing imide groups at lateral positions. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of −6.68 eV was estimated from the optical band gap. The density functional theory calculations reveal that the LUMO level of 4a mainly localized on the NDI core, while the HOMO distributed over the whole π-system (Fig. S2, ESI†). DFT calculations also indicate that the steric effects between the H atom in naphthalene monoimide and the oxygen atom in NDI promote slight deviation of 4a from planarity with a dihedral angle of around 10° (Fig. S3, ESI†).

For the initial device applications of 4a and 4b, thin-film OFETs were fabricated in the “top contact” geometry by spin-coating chlorobenzene solution onto OTS-SiO2/Si substrates. The film of 4b shows a relatively low mobility of 7.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 under nitrogen, due to the poor morphology of the film formed from the solution, and perhaps due to strong one-dimensional intermolecular interactions between the cores, leading to numerous grain boundaries in the devices (Fig. S4, ESI†). In contrast, 4a exhibited a higher electron mobility of up to 1.6 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. It appears that the branched alkyl chains improve the connectivity between crystalline grains on the substrate (Fig. S5, ESI†). Finally, we evaluated the intrinsic charge carrier mobility of the semiconductors in the form of single-crystalline microfibers, which were prepared by slow evaporation of chloroform solution. Fig. 3A shows an optical micrograph of compound 4b that forms long and sharp needle-like fibers in chloroform with crystal dimensions of half μm width and hundreds of μm length. This is likely due to the large π surface, which is favorable for one-dimensional assembly by strong intermolecular π–π interaction. This is reminiscent of the self-assembly of PDI derivatives.13 The strong out-of-plane X-ray diffraction peaks indicate that the microfibers have high crystallinity (Fig. S8, ESI†). The d-spacing of 4a estimated from the diffraction peak is 15.5 Å. This value is shorter than that of the postulated interdigitation distance of C8-NDTI (17.6 Å) reported by Takimiya et al.,14 indicating that 4a probably tends to largely tilt against the substrate normal. However, the d-spacing of 4b is about 19.0 Å, which is very close to the interdigitation distance of C8-NDTI derivatives (18–18.6 Å),14 suggesting a possible alkyl chain interdigitation of 4b in the solid state. Although we do not fully understand the molecular self-assembly in these fibers at this time due to the lack of crystal structures, the data suggest a substantial difference in packing arrangement between 4a and 4b. Using the prepared single-crystalline microfibers, field-effect transistors were fabricated by a “gold strips” technique on the OTS-SiO2/Si with gold as source and drain electrodes.5Fig. 3C and D show the representative output and transfer characteristics of compound 4b microfibers. As expected, 4b shows exclusive electron charge transport with a mobility of up to 1.55 cm2 V−1 s−1 under ambient conditions (Fig. S5, ESI†), which slightly increased to 1.75 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off ratio of up to 106, as measured under nitrogen conditions. These values are three orders of magnitude higher than that of the thin-film transistors due to the reduced number of grain boundaries. However, the electron mobility of compound 4a is 0.61 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S7, ESI†), which drops to less than half of that of compound 4b. This could be due to the branched alkyl substituents at the imide position, which probably prevent an ideal molecular orientation required for efficient charge transport. We note that the mobility value is 5–7-fold lower than that of the state-of-the-art n-type semiconductors,15 but the unique structure could provide ample opportunities to improve the electron mobility by the appropriate choice of alkyl chain substituents to optimize the crystal packing.

In conclusion, we have described a straightforward route to synthesize a novel class of n-type semiconductors with four orthogonal imides by fusion of naphthalene monoimide to the lateral positions of NDI, which show attractive properties, such as solution processability, low-lying LUMO levels, and high electron affinities. In particular, the molecular packing conformation and thin film morphology of the new acceptor materials can be effectively tuned by selectively modifying the alkyl substituents at the four imide positions. These features make them promising candidates for organic electronic applications such as field-effect transistors and photovoltaic cells. A preliminary field-effect transistor based on solution-processed microfibers has exhibited an electron mobility of up to 1.75 cm2 V−1 s−1. Further comprehensive syntheses of a wide variety of new molecules with different alkyl substituents to improve the electrical performance and studies on structure–property relationships are now in progress.
