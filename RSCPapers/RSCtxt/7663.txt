    , Accepted 22nd March 2017First published on 23rd March 2017AbstractIn TiO2 both advantages (stability and low cost) and disadvantages (large bandgap) coexist, so how to optimize a bare TiO2 electrode is a continuous hot topic for the construction of suitable photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices based on TiO2 for water splitting. This paper reports a facile and simple fabrication of a TiO2/RGO/C3N4 photoelectrode for PEC splitting of water. Its heterostructure configuration has been characterized and confirmed by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, TEM and STEM. The introduction of both RGO and C3N4 film onto the surface of TiO2 is mainly due to the fact that C3N4 has a strong photoelectric ability to respond to visible light and RGO plays an important role in the fast transfer of photogenerated charges across interfaces. Photocurrent and monochromatic incident photon-to-photocurrent efficiency (IPCE) of the titled heterostructure have been obviously improved, and the IPCE value (0.5 V vs. AgCl/Ag) of TiO2/RGO/C3N4 was estimated to be up to 28% at a wavelength of 400 nm.
Introduction
Nowadays, the over-reliance on fossil fuel energy has caused many difficult and irreversible ecological and environmental problems, which limit the fast economic and social development of our world to some degree.1 Therefore, it has been an important challenge to explore recyclable and green energy in the field of chemical engineering and materials, and it is very lucky that solar energy offers both life to the animals on earth and the route to developing new energy sources.2–4 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is an attractive method to produce hydrogen by splitting water without any environment pollution.5 A photoanode fabricated with TiO2 exhibits excellent stability and water splitting efficiency, and its photocurrent (AM 1.5 illumination) could be up to several milli-amperes responding to just the UV light region.6,7 TiO2 possesses high potential for further improvement in its PEC performance, taking account of the fact that UV light occupies just a small part of the whole solar spectrum.8 According to previous reports,9 designing reasonable composite structures or altering the crystal structure of TiO2 are effective ways to overcome the limitation of its large band gap.
Carbon nitride (C3N4), as a new type of metal-free solar-conversion hybrid material, is composed of earth abundant, inexpensive and nontoxic elements, and it has been intensively applied in the photocatalytic field.10 More importantly, the bandgap of C3N4 is low and could respond to visible light.11,12 Therefore, modification of TiO2 with C3N4 has endowed bare TiO2 with good photocatalytic activity for water splitting under visible light, but the conductivity of C3N4 should be taken into consideration if the property of the C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure needs to be further improved. As we well know, the poor conductivity of C3N4 significantly limits the charge transfer to the interface between semiconductor and electrolyte, but the nature of the 2D structure of C3N4 offers us an alternative approach to mitigate its disadvantage, since the soft 2D micro-morphology means that C3N4 can be easily made into a laminated composite with some other 2D materials such as reduced graphene (RGO).13 The nature of RGO is that it has extremely high specific surface area, outstanding conductivity and electron mobility properties. Moreover, the hexagonal close-packed atomic layer structure of RGO is greatly similar to C3N4,14 resulting in the close contact between C3N4 and RGO if a C3N4/RGO heterostructure has been formed, which will basically increase the conductivity of bare C3N4.
Inspired by the above, we introduced a C3N4/RGO composited film onto the surface of TiO2 for the first time, in order to improve the light response range and conductivity of the photoelectrode. TiO2 with nanowire morphology was prepared through the hydrothermal method, while the C3N4 and GO were added onto the TiO2 nanowires by a spin-coating process; then the TiO2/RGO/C3N4 heterostructure was obtained after calcination in nitrogen atmosphere. The structural characterization proves the successful synthesis of TiO2/RGO/C3N4, and that the RGO/C3N4 has coated the surface of TiO2 as a film. The photocurrent and incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) value of TiO2/RGO/C3N4 have improved significantly, compared with bare TiO2, C3N4/TiO2 and TiO2/RGO electrodes, which indicates that both RGO and C3N4 take very important roles in this heterostructure.
Experimental section
TiO2 was synthesized by a hydrothermal process on an FTO substrate.15 The FTO substrates were ultrasonically rinsed in acetone, chloroform and anhydrous alcohol for 30 min, respectively. A Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave was filled with 45 mL of hydrochloric acid, 2.1 mL of tetrabutyl titanate and 45 mL of deionized water. A piece of FTO glass substrate was put into the liner with the conductive side facing the wall of the liner, and heated at 180 °C for 4 h. The substrates were removed and washed with deionized water to remove any residual ions when the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. Then the substrates were immersed into a solution with 1.5 mL of tetrabutyl titanate, 2 mL of acetic acid, and 100 mL of ethanol for 1 h. The obtained substrates were transferred to a Muffle furnace and annealed at 450 °C for 2 h. After the above operation, the TiO2 nanorods were prepared. A solution of 5 mL of ethanol, 0.021 g of C3N4 and 0.015 g of GO was ultrasonicated for 1 h. The TiO2 was modified with GO and C3N4 by spin coating with the above solution, and then annealed at 400 °C for 2 h in a gas flow of N2.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
PEC measurements were performed in a typical three-electrode potentiostat system, in which the TiO2/RGO/C3N4 heterostructure was used as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as a reference electrode, and platinum wire as a counter electrode. The illuminated area of the working electrode was kept at 1 cm2. 1 M NaOH solution was used as an electrolyte for PEC measurements. Linear sweeps (the scanning speed of the linear sweep voltammogram was from −0.8 V to 0.8 V) were measured by a CHI 852C electrochemical station, under a light source with a 300 W xenon lamp (Newport 6255), and the intensity of the light was 47 mW cm−2. IPCE (incident photon-to-photocurrent efficiency) data were collected by a CHI 852C electrochemical station with a solar simulator (Newport 69920, 300 W xenon lamp).
Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using an S-4800 II field-emission scanning electron microanalyzer with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) were performed on a JEM-2100 (HR) (200 keV). UV-Vis spectra were measured by a UV-2450 spectrophotometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out through a D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer. Raman spectroscopy was characterized by a DXR Raman microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with an ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer using Al Kα radiation (Thermo-VG Scientific, US).
Results and discussion
The synthesis process is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a. The TiO2 was formed as nanowires, which could effectively enhance the surface area and benefit the photogenerated charges which could directly transfer to both FTO substrate and electrolyte. GO with an excellent hydrophilic property was used as the precursor for the preparation of RGO, since RGO is surface hydrophobic, so would be difficult to disperse RGO well in solution with C3N4 for spin-coating. The calcination process in the N2 atmosphere can reduce the GO to RGO and also improve the contact among the three materials. The choice of heterostructure built from TiO2, RGO and C3N4 was mainly attributed to their band gap structures and conductivity properties. Since the conduction band (−1.22 eV) of C3N4 is more negative than that of TiO2 (−0.4 eV),16 the photogenerated electrons will transfer from C3N4 to TiO2, while the holes proceed in the reverse direction. The difference in band gap structure could help the separation of charges, and the C3N4 with its low bandgap can further endow the photoanode with a responsiveness to visible light. The RGO as a conductive linker sandwiched between C3N4 and TiO2 remedies the disadvantage of C3N4 and facilitates the charge transfer.

The crystal structure of the samples was first characterized by their XRD pattern (Fig. 2a). The bare FTO substrate as a reference sample exhibits an obvious diffraction peak located at ca. 38°, which can be assigned to SnO2.17 A diffraction peak at 36° appears after growing TiO2 on the FTO substrate,18 and the sharp peaks also confirm the good crystallinity of TiO2 obtained by the hydrothermal method. Unfortunately, we cannot observe the representative peaks from C3N4 or RGO based on the TiO2/RGO/C3N4 sample, and this phenomenon can be explained by the low degree of crystallinity, due to the 2D structure. In order to confirm the successful coating of RGO, Raman measurement (Fig. 2b) was applied. The Raman characteristic peaks of TiO2/RGO/C3N4 reveal the existence of RGO, since the peaks at 1316 cm−1 and 1597 cm−1 can be attributed to the D band and G band from RGO.19

XPS spectra were carried out to examine the chemical composition and chemical status of the constituent elements in TiO2/RGO/C3N4. It can be observed from Fig. 3a that Ti, O, C and N elements were well detected in the sample. The two peaks at 459.3 eV and 465 eV (Fig. 3b) correspond to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 spin states of Ti.20Fig. 3c shows the O1s spectrum of the TiO2/RGO/C3N4 electrode, and we find peaks at 529.5 eV, 530.5 eV, 533.4 eV, which means the existence of O element as an O lattice.21 XPS spectra (Fig. 3c) of C1s appeared as four peaks located at 284.7 eV, 285.9 eV, 288.8 eV and 289.8 eV.22 The peak at 284.7 eV can be assigned to sp2 C–C bonds of graphitic carbon from the RGO, while the peaks at 285.9 eV and 288.1 eV mainly result from the CN coordination and sp2-hybridized carbon in the N-containing aromatic rings (N–CN) of C3N4.23 The high resolution N1s spectrum (Fig. 3d) shows four deconvolution peaks at 398.6 eV, 399.2 eV, 401.2 eV, 404.6 eV, which effectively prove the introduction of the N element. Two dominant peaks were located at 398.6 eV and 399.2 eV, which can be attributed to the sp2-bonded aromatic N bound to C atoms of triazine units (C–NC) and the bridging N atoms of N–(C)3, respectively.24 Based on the above results, the successful decoration of C3N4 and RGO on the surface of TiO2 was proved.

We studied the morphology of TiO2 and the TiO2/RGO/C3N4 heterostructure by SEM. The TiO2 loaded on the FTO presents as uniform nanowires (Fig. 4), which agrees well with the previous report.25 After further coating with RGO or C3N4, it can be observed that the TiO2 nanowires still keep their precious morphology, except for a small decrease in the interspace between nanowires, which reveals that the RGO and C3N4 were not simply assembled as a layer on TiO2 but were wrapped on the surface of the TiO2 nanowires to form a core–shell structure. Cross-sectional views of the samples (Fig. 5) further show that TiO2 is surrounded by a film of RGO/C3N4, and the thickness of TiO2/RGO/C3N4 is about 2 μm.

The micro-structure of TiO2/RGO/C3N4 was also proved by the TEM image (Fig. 6a), where we can observe that the TiO2 nanowire surface was tightly coated with very thin film, and the close contact can be attributed to the calcination process. Fig. 6b gives an in-depth image of the 2D layer, and we can conclude that the 2D structure was composited with RGO and C3N4. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (Fig. 7) was applied to study the distribution of elements of TiO2/RGO/C3N4. It can be observed that the TiO2 was wrapped in the RGO/C3N4 thin films, and the elements such as C, O and N were well dispersed throughout all the film, suggesting that the heterostructure film was composed of RGO and C3N4. All the measurements above have given strong proof of the successful fabrication of the target TiO2/RGO/C3N4 heterostructure.

The linear scan sweeps (Fig. 8a) of TiO2/RGO/C3N4 were investigated for an electrochemical cell with three electrodes (samples as working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode). All the samples show significant photocurrents (47 mW cm−2) compared with their currents in the dark, suggesting that the samples possess excellent responsiveness to light.26 Taking the bare TiO2 as the reference, it can be observed that the photocurrent density has been slightly improved after modification with RGO or C3N4. This phenomenon reveals that on their own the conductivity of RGO or the low bandgap of C3N4 take a small role in the PEC performance of bare TiO2. However, the photocurrent density began to increase rapidly after combining the RGO and C3N4 together to modify TiO2 nanowires, and the absolute photocurrent density of TiO2/RGO/C3N4 is almost 1.5 times that of bare TiO2. Therefore, the complementarity between RGO and C3N4 makes full use of their advantages to realize an optimization of the PEC performance of a semiconductor heterostructure based on a TiO2 matrix. We did further characterization with electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), as shown in Fig. 8b, and the EIS data could reveal the charge-transfer resistance of the electrode. Compared with TiO2/C3N4, TiO2/RGO/C3N4 showed a smaller semicircle, which indicates the faster transport of charge carriers and more effective electron–hole pair separation due to the contribution of RGO. These EIS results for TiO2/C3N4 and TiO2/RGO/C3N4 are consistent with the corresponding I–V curves.

I–V characteristic curves of samples (solid line under light and dotted line under dark) (a), EIS spectra (b) and IPCE values (c) of the samples. 
The IPCE spectra (Fig. 8c) were performed with monochromatic incident light ranging from 350 to 600 nm at 0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl. IPCE data is an important parameter to value the photo-electron conversion efficiency of the photoelectrode.27 The IPCE data can be calculated by the following formula: IPCE = (1240 × I)/λ × Jlight (I is the photocurrent density per unit area, λ is the incident light wavelength and Jlight is the incident light power density),28 TiO2/RGO/C3N4 exhibits higher IPCE compared with TiO2, TiO2/RGO and TiO2/C3N4, and the IPCE value of TiO2/RGO/C3N4 can be up to 28% under 400 nm irradiation. The IPCE curves of the samples show a similar trend to their photocurrent density. Therefore, the titled heterostructure photoanode benefits from the wide absorption spectra of C3N4 and the fast charge transfer through an RGO 2D film, which effectively enhance the amount and separation of photogenerated charges.
Conclusion
We successfully synthesized TiO2/RGO/C3N4 by stepwise chemical and physical methods. The low bandgap and conductivity of RGO and C3N4 could be beneficial to the generation and separation of photocharges. The more negative conduction band accelerates the injection of electrons into the TiO2 layer, and then it will be suitable for the transfer of electrons to the counter electrode for the reduction of protons. The photocurrent density of TiO2/RGO/C3N4 is about 1.5 times that of bare TiO2, and the optimized IPCE value of TiO2/RGO/C3N4 could achieve 28% under 400 nm irradiation. All results of the linear scan sweeps and IPCE spectra provided good evidence that the designed TiO2/RGO/C3N4 heterostructure possesses improved PEC performance, due to the complementary advantages of both RGO and C3N4.
