    , Accepted 25th March 2019First published on 25th March 2019AbstractYb3+,Er3+,Tm3+:Y2Si2O7 nanopowders were fabricated by a sol–gel method and then annealed at two different temperatures of 1050 °C and 1480 °C for 12 h to investigate the phase effect on the structural and optical properties. X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of all powders revealed that most of the peaks were in good harmony with the standard JCPDS cards of Y2Si2O7 (PDF #38-0223 and PDF #38-0440). SEM images of the powders were taken to examine the morphology and chemical composition of the powders. Diffuse reflection spectra of Y2Si2O7 exhibited varying number of transitions depending on the dopant ion in all powders in the range of 400–1050 nm. The spectral properties of the powders were investigated to identify the possible up-conversion (UC) emission mechanism in the range between 400 and 900 nm under 975 nm excitation. A broadening white light emission was observed with increasing laser pumping power at room temperature as well. Spectral profiles of the transitions observed in both reflectance and up-conversion luminescence spectra were found to be crystalline phase dependent.
1. Introduction
In recent years, there has been increasing research interest in doping nanomaterials with optically active ions with remarkably close attention being paid to developing new technologies in photonics and optoelectronics.1–3 The host lattice of yttrium silicate combined with rare earth metals has attracted potential interest in both the generation of white light via the up-conversion mechanism and its practical use in thermometric sensing, infrared detection, and solar cells.4–6
The current studies are focused on the understanding of white light generation with the up-conversion mechanism (UC) and its origin with double or triple combinations of RE3+ doped nano-powders as well. In general, in the UC process, the emission at a shorter wavelength than the excitation wavelength is caused by absorption of two or more photons. The UC mechanism in trivalent RE3+-doped materials is based on the electronic transitions inside the 4f band occurring with a sequential absorption of low-energy photons.7,8
By the UC mechanism or direct excitation, the yttrium disilicate (Y2SiO7) host lattice doped with RE3+ ions, offer possibilities for the emissions in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared regions via the transitions as denoted in the RE3+ energy-level scheme.9–11 In all of the six different phase formations (y, z, α, β, g, and d) of Y2Si2O7, α-Y2Si2O7 and β-Y2Si2O7 exhibit a triclinic structure with the P, space group and a monoclinic structure with the C2/m space group, respectively.12,13
The objective of the present paper is to compare the structural features and functioning mechanism of upconversion emissions of Yb3+,Er3+,Tm3+:Y2Si2O7 nanopowders annealed at two different temperatures (1050 °C and 1480 °C for 12 h) under the excitation of a 975 nm laser diode in air to investigate the phase effect of the UC process.
2. Experimental
The chemicals used to synthesize nanocrystalline α-Y2Si2O7 doped with RE3+ were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich with a purity of 99.9%. The sol–gel method was used to obtain the desired phosphor powders. TEOS (Si(OC2H5)4), ytterbium nitrate (Yb(NO3)·H2O), erbium nitrate (Er(NO3)·5H2O), thulium nitrate (Tm(NO3)·5H2O), and yttrium nitrate (Y(NO3)·6H2O) were used as precursors with a suitable stoichiometry. The preparation method for the nano-crystalline Y2Si2O7 doped with RE3+ is detailed in the literature.9 Powders with five different dopant concentrations were labeled as shown in Table 1.

Powders were annealed at 1050 °C and 1480 °C for 12 h in order to investigate the effect of annealing on the nanocrystal structures. A Bruker D2 Phaser model X-ray diffraction diffractometer with a CuKα radiation source was used to measure the XRD patterns of all the powders to examine their structural behaviors. An FEI Inc. Inspect S50 model SEM was used to monitor the surface morphology of the samples. So as to determine the elemental compositions, an EDAX Inc.-Octane Prime spectrometer was used for energy dispersive X-ray measurements.
A PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV-VIS spectrophotometer was used to record diffuse reflectance spectra due to the absorption lines of RE3+ ions within the 400 to 1100 nm wavelength range at room temperature. A CNI MDL-H-975 model laser diode with a wavelength of 975 nm was used to record the UC spectra of α-Y2Si2O7 doped thrice with the RE3+ ions. The focused luminescence was detected using an Acton series-SI 440 silicon detector and Princeton Instruments-SP2500i monochromator. To prevent scattered excitation light entering the monochromator, a 950 nm short pass filter (Edmund Optics) was used before its entrance slit. A Coherent Field Max II – TOP Model power meter was used to measure the laser power on the sample. The CIE – 1931 chromaticity coordinates of the emission were measured with an Asense Tek Lighting Passport illuminance meter.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural analysis

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the XRD patterns of the YSYET nanocrystals in the range of 10–55° (2θ) measured at a step size of 0.02. As seen in Fig. 1(a), the diffraction peak positions of all samples annealed at 1050 °C for 12 h exhibit good harmony with the standard card data of triclinic α-Y2Si2O7 (JCPDS: PDF #38-0223). The XRD peaks of the samples annealed at 1480 °C for 12 h are in good agreement with the standard card data of β-Y2Si2O7 (JCPDS: PDF #38-0440). No secondary phase was monitored from the XRD patterns of all powders. The positions and the shapes of the diffraction peaks are found to be the same for all the doping concentrations; hence, the incorporation of tridopants results in hardly any change in the crystal phase structure. The samples annealed at 1050 °C and 1480 °C are labeled as α-YSYET and β-YSYET, respectively. From Scherrer's equation, the average crystalline sizes were determined to be about 21 ± 3 nm and 40 ± 5 nm for α-YSYET and β-YSYET nanoparticles, respectively.
 Fig. 1  XRD graphs of Yb3+-, Er3+-, and Tm3+-doped Y2Si2O7 samples annealed at 1050 °C (a, b), and 1480 °C (c, d). 
The SEM images of the powders seen in Fig. 2a and b show that the particles for two phases are not uniform and their sizes are variable. The particles are non-agglomerated, and have a relatively narrow size distribution with the particle sizes varying from 40 to 90 nm for α-Y2Si2O7, while the particles are agglomerated and their particle sizes change between 80 nm and 300 nm for β-Y2Si2O7 due to the increased annealing temperature. Fig. 3c and d illustrate the energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX) results of these two phases. The EDAX spectrum of the nanoparticles with two different phase shows the signals that indicates the presence of just Yb, Er, Tm, Y, Si, and O atoms in the powders.

3.2. Optical characterization

3.2.1. Diffuse reflections. 

Fig. 3 presents the diffuse reflection spectra of tri-doped α-YSYET and β-YSYET samples in the range of 400–1100 nm. Five absorption bands were observed with remarkable intensity corresponding to Er3+ ion transitions from the ground state (4I15/2) to different excited states and three absorption bands corresponding to the transitions from the 3H6 ground state of the Tm3+ ion to different excited states. There is one absorption band for Yb3+ ions corresponding to the transition from the 2F7/2 ground state to the 2F5/2 excited state. As can be seen from the figure, the ion concentrations can only affect the intensity while the spectral profiles remained almost the same for different dopant concentrations. This indicates that the RE ions were at isolated sites and they did not form any pairs. Fig. 3(b) displays the diffuse reflectance spectra of the α-YSYET3 and β-YSYET3 nano-powders in the range of 850–1000 nm to investigate the effect of the crystalline phase of the host on the transitions. The change in spectral profile of the dip with the phase transformation of Y2Si2O7 resulted in the change in the shape and the position of the absorption bands with annealing temperature. The strongest absorption bands of the α-YSYET3 and β-YSYET3 nano-powders correspond to the deepest dip around 972 nm and 977.2 nm in this region. These absorptions are related to the transition from the lowest Stark level of the ground-level state 2F7/2 (0) to the lowest Stark level of the excited state 2F5/2 (0) of the Yb3+ ions.


3.2.2. Up-conversion emission properties. 

Fig. 4 exhibits the UC-emission spectra of tridoped α and β phase Y2Si2O7 nano-phosphors in the range of 400–850 nm under 491 W cm−2 power of 975 nm laser excitation. The visible UC emissions were observed from the phosphors in the green spectral region, which is localized at around 525 nm and 547 nm associated with the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ions, respectively. The red emission of Er3+ and Tm3+ ions was located at around 663 nm and 692 nm attributed to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 and the 3F2,3 → 3H6 transitions, respectively. The emissions in the near infrared region, which is around 800 nm, correspond to the 3H4 → 3H6 transition of Tm3+ and 4I9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+. For the β-phase Y2Si2O7 nanophosphors (see Fig. 4(b)), the weak blue emission was observed at around 480 nm associated with the 1G4 → 3H6 transition of Tm3+ ions. The phase-dependent spectral profile change of the UC emissions can also be seen in Fig. 4, which indicates that the crystal phase of the host does affect the luminescence properties. The emission intensities of the β-phase Y2Si2O7 nanophosphors were found to be much stronger than the α-phase Y2Si2O7 nanophosphors at a low pumping power due to the lower phonon energy of the silicate group vibrations in the β-phase of the Y2Si2O7 host material.14
 Fig. 4  UC-emission spectra of tri-doped α-YSYET and β-YSYET nanophosphors at 491 W cm−2 excitation power. 
The UC emission intensity (as a function of excitation power) was measured to find out the up-conversion luminescence of the presented emission bands. The fitted results of the green and red emissions for all the triple doped YSYET nanocrystals are given in Table 2. Excitation power dependence of the blue emission corresponding to the 1G4 → 3H6 transition of Tm3+ ions could not be evaluated since its intensity was too weak to be measured because of the low quantum efficiency of the Si-diode detector used. As an example, Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the dependence of the up-conversion emission intensities (I) on the excitation power (P) of the α-YSYET4 and β-YSYET4 nanocrystalline powders, respectively.

We conclude that the up-conversion process belonging to red and green emissions took place via a two-photon process. In order to explain the mechanism for the two-photon process, we think that energy transfers from Yb3+ ions to the Er3+ and Tm3+ ions may efficiently occur to populate their upper excited levels. The 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition gives rise to red emission (∼680 nm) besides the 4I15/2 (Er3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+) → 4I11/2 (Er3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+) energy transfer. The 4F9/2 level of Er3+ can also be populated by energy transfer via4I13/2 (Er3+) + 2F5/2(Yb3+) → 4F9/2 (Er3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+) transition. 4I11/2 (Er3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+) → 4F7/2 (Er3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+) energy transfer processes may increase the population of the 4F7/2 level from which the levels 4S3/2 and 2I11/2 are populated through non-radiative processes, which result in green emissions (∼525 and ∼547 nm).
Consequently, because of the energy transfer due to the 3H6 (Tm3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+) → 3F2,3 (Tm3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+) transitions, red emission (692 nm) was observed. Relaxation from the 3F2,3 state to the 3H4 state may occur due to the non-radiative processes. Finally, radiative processes through relaxation from the 3H4 state to the ground state 3H6 generate the infrared emission at ∼795 nm.
The International Commission on Illumination (CIE-1931) coordinates of tri-doped α and β phase Y2Si2O7 nanophosphors were obtained using an illuminance meter to determine the color quality parameters. At the same excitation power density (352 W cm−2), the CIE-1931 coordinates of α, and β phase Y2Si2O7 nanophosphors are tabulated in Table 3. As seen from the table, the chromaticity coordinates were changed by both the lanthanide ion concentration and the phase of the Y2Si2O7 host.

The CIE-1931 diagram, illuminance-meter spectrum, camera image and emission spectrum observed using the Si-detector of α-YSYET4 and β-YSYET4 nano-powders are given in Fig. 6(a) and (b). The CIE-1931 coordinate values were found to be (0.3370; 0.3303) and (0.3063; 0.3172) for α-YSYET4 and β-YSYET4, respectively.

The generation of broadband white light (WL) of α and β-Y2Si2O7 was observed by illuminating the nano-powder samples with the 975 nm laser excitation tuned at 1054 W cm−2 power (Fig. 7). The origin of white broadband emission could be evaluated relying on previous studies.15–20 A possible mechanism that could explain our results as consistent with those reported in the literature was based on both up-conversion and thermally stimulated processes.

The color analysis of the samples for varying excitation power densities is given in Fig. 8. The white arrows on the diagrams are a guide to the eye to illustrate the direction of the (x,y) coordinates shifting from the white region to the yellowish region with increasing pumping power per square from 82.8 to 1050 W cm−2. As can be seen from the figure, color tuning from the blue to the yellow region can be accomplished by varying the excitation power in α-Y2Si2O7 nanopowders. However, the color of the β-Y2Si2O7 nanopowders does not vary appreciably and remains in the blue region below the threshold value of the excitation power necessary for the production of broadband white light.

4. Conclusion
Sol–gel-synthesized Yb3+:Er3+:Tm3+ -doped Y2Si2O7 nano-powders indicated that when the powders were annealed at 1050 °C and 1480 °C for 12 h. The XRD peaks matched well with the standard JCPDS card data of α-Y2Si2O7 (PDF #38-0223) and β-phase of Y2Si2O7 (PDF #38-0440). Diffuse reflection spectra of α-Y2Si2O7 and β-Y2Si2O7 presented varying number of transitions relying on the elemental doping to Y2Si2O7 samples in the range of 400–1100 nm.
Spectral profiles of the transitions observed in both reflectance and up-conversion (UC) luminescence spectra were found to be crystalline phase dependent. Color quality parameters of white light measured using an illuminance meter were almost the same indicating that the effect of the crystalline structure may be ignored in these nanophosphors at low excitation power densities. UC emission from the studied phosphors almost does not contain the blue component; hence, the color rendering index was found to be 79, below the excitation threshold power of 850 W cm−2. A broad white light with a higher color rendering index (97) was observed above the threshold power, which could be an advantage for these phosphors in photonics.
The color parameter (x,y) coordinates are found to be more sensitive to the excitation power density of a 975 nm laser in both α and β-Y2Si2O7, which results in shifting from the white region to the yellowish region with increasing pumping power.
