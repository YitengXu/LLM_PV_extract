    , Accepted 10th March 2016First published on 10th March 2016AbstractWhile the field of thermoelectricity continues developing, the academic world is still debating its applicability for wide-scale implementation. The main concerns revolve around its low energy conversion efficiency (5–10%), compared to photovoltaics (up to 46%), and the environmental impact of commonly used materials (e.g. Bi2Te3, PbTe). Although less scrutinized, other fields such as photoelectrochemistry and catalysis have suffered from similar drawbacks. In light of the recent developments, the question arises, if the introduction of hybrid devices combining those renewable energy sources is preferable to the current divided efforts. Several new papers bring arguments in favor of this combined approach, with an efficiency of 16% reported for a triboelectric–thermoelectric–photovoltaic water splitting cell.

Broader context
The challenges of fossil fuel depletion and climate change have brought a remarkable shift in the academic landscape. Accordingly, research has been increasingly focused in the last few decades on the development of renewable energy sources and more efficient industrial processes. The surge in available funding has resulted in major advances in technologies such as thermoelectrics, photoelectrochemistry, photovoltaics and catalysis. Still, a recent capping of funds has led to the question, if some energy sources should be prioritized over the rest. Among others, thermoelectricity has been particularly scrutinized for its low energy conversion efficiency of 5–10% and the typical used materials. While other earth-abundant compounds are still in development, we take a look at the concept of combining several renewable energy sources in one device. The proof of its potential is shown by a triboelectric–thermoelectric–photovoltaic water splitting cell with an efficiency of 16%.

The inevitable depletion of the fossil fuel reserves has led to substantial efforts made in developing sustainable energy sources. Among the recognized alternatives, such as wind- and hydro(thermal)energy, other technologies have also been expanding. Fields such as photovoltaics (PV),1,2 and the so-called solar fuels3,4 have attracted the attention of the academic community, together with more traditional attempts to mimic the activity of natural enzymes for industrial processes.5–7 Although often overlooked, due to its low power output and restrained applicability, thermoelectricity (TE) has continued steadily developing itself, with a step-wise increase of performance over several decades (see Fig. 1 and 2). This development has been driven by its potential for directly delivering electrical current from a temperature difference, in the absence of moving parts. Nevertheless these results have mostly achieved its implementation in niche applications, such as space missions, or research instruments, where the purpose overshadows the costs of low efficiency.8,9

To explain the cause of this low efficiency, we first have to look at the material properties and the relation between them. The usually investigated thermoelectric parameters are the Seebeck coefficient (or thermopower) S, the electrical conductivity σ and the thermal conductivity κ. While S is a measure for the achieved voltage at a given temperature difference, σ gives the current losses from Joule heating, through internal material resistance. The latter parameter, κ, is instead a measure for the ability to maintain a temperature gradient. If the thermal conductivity is high, then the temperature difference between both ends will be quickly lowered, decreasing the maximal achievable voltage.10 As such, it is not unexpected that the combination of these factors, namely the figure-of-merit ZT, is defined as in eqn (1). The power factor PF, a function of S and σ, is also often encountered, while the average temperature is denoted Tm.8 (1) The main advantage of calculating the figure-of-merit is the possibility to directly determine the energy conversion efficiency η, using the relation from eqn (2).8 As for any other heat engines, the maximal conversion is also here restricted by the ideal Carnot efficiency, ηC = (Th − Tc)/Th, which means the typical η amounts to 5.7–18.6%, for a ZT between 0.3 and 1.5 (the η values are determined using Tc = 300 K and Th = 800 K, found for example in car exhaust gases).11 (2) While the field of thermoelectricity continues developing, the academic world is still divided regarding its applicability for wide-scale implementation. This divergence of opinion has been particularly recognizable in a number of recent papers from highly respected journals,9,12–15 denoting its polarizing effect on the scientific community. The debate has continued going back and forth over the years, with no acceptable solution in sight.
On the one side, there are the supporters of thermoelectricity, who insist on the prospects of using the Seebeck effect for recovering waste heat. The most encountered examples are the thermoelectric generator (TEG) prototypes tested for the car exhaust systems11 and the ones designed for industrial facilities.16 Several research groups go even further, proposing thermoelectric fabrics, which could ultimately convert body heat into electrical current for wearable smart gadgets.17–19 For those scholars, even the slow rate of ZT enhancement is not a major hindrance, since the figures-of-merit can reach theoretical values as high as 15.20,21
On the other side, the detractors of this field insist on the small energy conversion efficiencies achieved by the commercial thermoelectric modules, which they usually compare with the ones from the photovoltaic technology, or even with the common combustion engines.12 Indeed, when comparing typical TEGs (η around 5–6%, at a ZT ≈ 0.8)13 with the latest GaInP/GaAs/GaInAs/GaInAs multijunction solar cells (η in excess of 45%2), they do seem a bit underwhelming. Nevertheless, what the critics forget to mention is the outstanding interest received by other research areas, such as solar fuels or complex catalysis, where the efficiencies are often even below 5%. For example, the introduction of the artificial leaf by Nocera et al.22 has provoked great interest, which has materialized in over 1100 papers since 2013 (according to SciFinder, when searching for the concept of “artificial photosynthesis”). Accordingly, the 13 most popular papers have already received in excess of 100 citations (as of 22.12.2015), although the reported efficiencies for most photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems have remained below 1%.3,23,24
Other powerful examples come from the world of inorganic catalysis, where some legitimate, but still very ambitious goals have led to massive resources being invested in their direction. To be more specific, these objectives have concerned the improvement of energy consuming industrial processes (e.g. the Haber–Bosch ammonia synthesis,25) or the reduction of CO2,26 mostly by mimicking natural enzyme complexes6 (see nitrogenase,5,25,27,28 or hydrogenases7,29,30). Again, despite all the sustained efforts, the obtained models have failed to offer the fast reaction rates and the substrate selectivity of their natural counterparts.
Although these attempts might be compared with the search for a thermoelectric material with a ZT = 4,12 those fields do not find themselves under the same scrutiny. From here it may be concluded that the perceived relevance of research does not correlate with its absolute performance, but with its potential to grow, i.e. to deliver new results. Consequently, the two given examples continue to thrive, driven by their relative novelty and their industrial potential, which differentiate them from thermoelectricity. This divergence can be also seen in Fig. 2, which depicts the development of some energy conversion records over time.
Another possible drawback of thermoelectricity is represented by the race between researchers to obtain high figures-of-merit, which are often achieved by undertaking a parametric material optimization. This approach is mainly based on doping, variation in stoichiometry, and substitutions with related elements in well known materials, which leads to a broad range of similar compounds, with comparable properties (quite a few have also been gathered on the website http://www.tedesignlab.org, on the initiative of Toberer et al.15,32). As a result, the ZT values are mostly stuck at around 1. Although values higher than 2 are occasionally reported, these materials are either inaccessible to practical applications, or sometimes difficult to reproduce. But even in these cases, the figure-of-merit has not reached the threshold of 4, which could presumably guarantee its wider implementation.12 This quest for a record breaking figure-of-merit is also one of the major problems when publishing, since its absolute value becomes the most important factor, regardless of the material's suitability for real life applications.
Another reason, why the thermoelectric research has lost ground, is the variety of materials used, since its best representatives continue to revolve around chalcogenides (e.g. Bi2Te3, PbTe). This use of toxic elements, which are not earth abundant, also hinders the economic prospects of such devices. Although several environmentally friendly alternatives exist, such as complex oxides, silicides, or SiGe alloys,13,14,33,34 they remain somewhat overseen, due to their lower S, lower σ, or higher κ, which often result in ZT values below 0.5. A similar situation is also encountered in the case of organic thermoelectrics, although their relative novelty and tunability has attracted significantly more interest in recent years. Nevertheless, exactly those types of compounds could be best implemented in practical applications, since they are easily obtainable and most suited for specific temperature ranges. To be more precise, the oxides and SiGe alloys are recognized for their viability in high temperature applications, reaching around 1200 K (e.g. industrial furnaces),9,33 where usual thermoelectric materials would just melt. At the same time the organic compounds present the advantages of being light-weight and flexible, corresponding to the required criteria for wearable thermoelectrics.18,19,35,36 Although the melting point of such plastics often amounts to only 400–450 K, this is more than enough for low temperature applications.36
While this debate continues until now, maybe the most sensible alternative remains underestimated, namely the integration of these various energy sources for a higher combined total efficiency (see Fig. 1 and 2). Although putting this idea into practice is not that straightforward, since device design and optimization have to be taken into consideration, the advantages of such an approach can be already observed. Returning to our old examples of solar induced water splitting and photovoltaics, several papers have already demonstrated that by combing them, the hydrolysis efficiency can reach as high as 18.3%.3,37,38 Moreover, timid attempts have also been made for thermoelectric–photovoltaic hybrid devices.39–41 These first efforts have delivered efficiencies of up to 22%,41 although device optimization could well expand their range. For example, by increasing the thickness of the TEG, a higher temperature difference could be achieved along the thermoelectric legs, which would then result in a higher output.
Furthermore, the integration of all three named technologies should also be within reach. This has been first proved by the group of Yang et al.,40 who managed to produce among others a triboelectric–thermoelectric–photovoltaic water splitting device with an efficiency of 16%, paving the way for mass-production of hybrid cells. In this case, the electric current could be efficiently stored in the form of chemical bonds during the day, and then regained at a desired time using fuel cells. For the latter, a further integration of various alternative energy sources would also be convenient. Since the fuel cells generate waste heat during use, their energy conversion efficiency would benefit again from incorporating thermoelectric generators, as previously reported.42,43 Such integrated systems could then expand beyond home installed power stations, into portable solutions for the automotive industry. In the best case scenario, these small power plants would even allow the hydrogen cars to be refueled at home. Consequently, this approach may offer the key to solving one of the greatest contemporary challenges, namely the renewable energy management.
Even so, the strategy of combining various technologies is not only restrained to thermoelectricity, photovoltaics and water splitting. Instead, a wide range of related concepts can also bring significant contributions, as revealed in a number of recently published papers. Those articles present very diverse approaches, including prototypes of ionic thermoelectric supercapacitors,44 thermopower wave devices,45,46 wearable thermoelectric generators,17,19 pyroelectric–thermoelectric nanogenerators,47 photovoltaic–piezoelectric–pyroelectric and piezoelectric–biochemical nanogenerators,48 to name a few. Although examples of such hybrid devices are still relatively scarce, their gradual development over the last 5 years appears highly encouraging, offering further alternatives for scavenging the ambient thermal, mechanical, or solar energy. Nevertheless, the role of thermoelectricity remains pivotal for hybrid energy harvesting devices, as the main route for obtaining a stable direct-current from temperature gradients, without the need of further capacitors, rechargeable batteries, or rectifiers.19
In light of the recent developments, the question arises, if such an integrated approach is not preferable to the old parametric material optimization. As researchers in the field of thermoelectricity ourselves, we feel that the main emphasis should be put more on finding new ideas and integrating the promising ones with other technologies. In this way, more environmentally friendly compounds could find a better way to reach the market, while reducing the number of record breaking, toxic compounds, which are not economically viable. At the same time, the critics outside the field of thermoelectricity should also try to bring a constructive input to the discussion, finding ways of joining forces, instead of competing. In the energetic economy, as in any other financial field, every percent counts!
