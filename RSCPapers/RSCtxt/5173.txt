    , Accepted 22nd August 2021First published on 23rd August 2021AbstractA photocatalyst foam is developed by growing high-density CdS microspheres on Ni2P nanolayer-modified Ni foam (NF) (termed CdS/NF–P) for efficient visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 evolution. The in situ grown Ni2P thin layer on NF not only provides a large number of anchoring sites for the growth of high-density CdS microspheres for enhancing the visible light capture ability, but also offers active sites for catalyzing the H2 evolution reaction (HER). Meanwhile, the multiple heterojunction interfaces formed among NF, Ni2P, and CdS can greatly promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. As a consequence, the CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam exhibits good photocatalytic H2 evolution activity under visible light irradiation. The H2 evolution rate reaches 4.82 mmol h−1 gCdS−1 over the best CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam, which is about five times that of CdS particles suspended in the reaction solution. More attractively, the photocatalyst foam can be easily recovered and recycled in the reaction solution by simple magnetic separation. In addition, the structural integrity makes the photocatalyst foam highly stable in the photocatalytic HER for 35 h. This work provides a new strategy for the design of efficient and practical photocatalyst foams that are easy to prepare on a large scale and compatible with device manufacturing for large-scale photochemical energy conversion.
Introduction
With the increasing consumption of fossil fuels, the environmental pollution and energy shortage have become the most urgent global problems.1 Photocatalytic H2 evolution via splitting water using semiconductor photocatalysts can efficiently convert solar energy into chemical energy for clean energy production and environmental remediation, which is one of the most promising strategies to solve these challenges.2 The photocatalytic H2 evolution performance of a semiconductor photocatalyst mainly depends on three factors: the light absorption capability of the semiconductor, the efficiency of charge separation and migration, and the redox reactivity of the surface.3 In general, traditional semiconductor photocatalysts in the form of nanosized powders are beneficial for efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution because the high surface area can provide more active sites and reduce the charge transfer pathway to suppress the recombination of charge carriers.4 However, it is noted that the powdered nanoparticles not only have a strong tendency to form large aggregates but also require complex operations to extract catalysts from the reaction solution for recycling.5 Meanwhile, the used powders may cause secondary pollution and enter human or animal cells, resulting in serious toxic effects.6 To overcome these shortcomings, semiconductor photocatalyst nanoparticles have been immobilized on appropriate supports such as ceramic foam,7 polymer films,8 aerogel sponge,9 and glass10,11 to fabricate monolithic photocatalysts with excellent photocatalytic performance even higher than their corresponding powdery systems.10,11 However, the weak contact between photocatalyst particles and the underlying substrate will result in insufficient stability during the long-term use. Therefore, it puts forward high requirements for the development of new integrated photocatalysts that can combine solar energy conversion and environmental remediation at macro and nanoscales.12
In this regard, Qu et al.13 have reported that the dicyandiamide solution after hydrothermal treatment was freeze-dried to obtain the dicyandiamide aerogel with uniform pore structure, and then the g-C3N4 aerogel was obtained by direct pyrolysis. This aerogel has a structure similar to that of seaweed, which is conducive to light capture/charge separation and the utilization of active sites. Liang et al.14 obtained g-C3N4/carbon sponge by freeze-drying melamine sponge with adsorbed urea solution and heating it at 550 °C for 4 h in a nitrogen atmosphere. The H2 production activity of the resulting g-C3N4/carbon sponge is 2.84 times higher than that of the powder g-C3N4. The enhanced activity comes from the rich pore structure, large specific surface area, and carbon sponge to promote efficient separation of photogenerated carriers. Lianos et al.15 have reported a Pt–TiO2 aerogel formed by a sol–gel process of the colloidal suspension of the TiO2 and Pt mixture. The H2 production rate of the Pt–TiO2 aerogel can reach 7.2 mmol g−1 h−1, and the enhanced activity can be attributed to its large specific surface area and special network structure, which effectively increase the electron capture sites and shorten the electron migration distance. Also, it should be noted that photocatalyst sponges or aerogels as monolithic photocatalytic materials have the advantages of low cost and easy preparation in large areas, and can be customized for different shapes and sizes required for different scenes. However, due to their poor mechanical strength, it is difficult to meet the needs of high strength for long-term application, and thus ceramic foam or metal-based monolithic photocatalytic materials with good mechanical strength and compressive strength emerge. In our previous work,16 we have developed a simple strategy to fabricate a 3D monolithic photocatalyst by directly growing CdS microspheres on Ni(OH)2 nanosheet modified nickel foam (Ni(OH)2/NF) to achieve efficient visible light photocatalytic H2 production. The Ni(OH)2/NF with an interconnected 3D structure provides a large surface area and open space to grow high-density CdS microspheres. At the same time, Ni(OH)2 nanosheets can be transformed into NiSxin situ, which not only ensures the close combination of CdS and NF but also acts as a H2 evolution catalyst, promoting the separation of electrons and holes and photocatalytic H2 production. However, the loading of CdS for the above photocatalyst is very low (ca. 1 mg), which significantly restricts the enhancement of photocatalytic H2 production due to the insufficient light absorption. Meanwhile, the catalytic activity of NiSx as a cocatalyst is inferior to those of recently developed nickel-based cocatalysts,17 which further limits the development of highly active self-supported photocatalysts for the photocatalytic HER under visible light.18,19
In this work, we report the direct growth of CdS microspheres on Ni2P nanolayer modified nickel foam (NF–P) to prepare a 3D photocatalyst foam (CdS/NF–P) for efficient visible-light-driven H2 production. The exposed 3D framework provides a large surface area and open space for the growth of high-density CdS microspheres. The in situ grown Ni2P layer not only ensures the close combination of CdS and the NF substrate, so that the substrate can load a large number of catalysts but also serves as an efficient cocatalyst to promote electron–hole separation and photocatalytic H2 production. The results show that the resulting CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam has good photocatalytic H2 evolution activity under visible light, which is 5 times higher than that of the dispersed system of CdS powder. Excellent structural integrity and inherent magnetism also make CdS/NF–P highly stable and easy to recycle in the process of repeated photocatalytic H2 production.
Experimental section
Chemicals and materials
All reagents were of analytical grade without further purification. Ethanol (99.7%) and lactic acid (LA, 85–90%) were obtained from Shanghai Guangnuo Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. Acetone (99.5%) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 99.5%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Cd(CH2COO)2·2H2O (99.0%) was purchased from Xilong Scientific Co., Ltd. Thiourea (99.0%) was received from Tianjin Dingshengxin Fine Chemical Industry, and NaH2PO2·H2O (99.0%) was received from Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Nickel foam (99.9%, thickness 1.6 mm) was purchased from Shenzhen Kejing Technology Co., Ltd. All solutions were prepared with ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ cm) obtained using a water purification system (Hitech ECO-S15).

In situ growth of the Ni2P layer on Ni foam (NF–P)
In the typical preparation process, nickel foam (NF) with a diameter of 1.6 cm was ultrasonically cleaned in ethanol, acetone and water. After that, the NF was further washed with HCl solution (3.0 M) for 10 min to remove the surface oxide layer, rinsed with water several times, and finally dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight. The cleaned NF was subjected to gas-phase phosphidation as follows: 1 g of NaH2PO2 was put into a tube furnace at the upstream side and the NF was placed in the middle of the tube furnace. The tube furnace was heated to 300 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 and kept at that temperature for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained sample, denoted as NF–P, was washed several times with water and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight.
Preparation of CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foams
CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foams were prepared by direct growth of CdS particles on the surface of NF–P by a hydrothermal method. In a typical procedure, a 50 mL aqueous solution containing thiourea and Cd(CH2COO)2·2H2O was first prepared in a Teflon-lined vessel (100 mL). The molar ratio of thiourea to Cd(CH2COO)2·2H2O was kept as 1:1. Then, a piece of NF–P foam was placed into the above solution and the Teflon container was sealed in a stainless steel reactor and heated at 180 °C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained photocatalyst foam was removed from the reaction solution, washed several times with water, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight. The obtained sample was labeled as CdS/NF–P-n, where the n represents the addition amount of Cd(CH2COO)2·2H2O (0.1 mmol, 0.15 mmol, 0.2 mmol, 0.25 mmol, and 0.3 mmol). The loading amount of CdS particles was determined by weighing the NF–P foam before and after the hydrothermal process. The free CdS particles were collected by filtering the remaining reaction solution, washed with water and dried at 60 °C overnight. The reference samples CdS/NF and CdS + NF–P were prepared by physically loading free CdS particles on NF and NF–P foam, respectively, by a drop-coating method.
Characterization
Power X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer with nickel filtered Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 5–80° with a scanning rate of 10° min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of the samples were performed on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Escalab-250Xi) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. The binding energy refers to the C 1s peak of contaminated carbon (set as 284.8 eV). Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) images were taken with a ZEISS EVO 10 scanning electron microscope. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda-750 with an integrating sphere. BaSO4 powder was used as the reflection standard. Photoluminescence spectra were measured using a Horiba Scientific FluoroMax-4 spectrophotometer.
Photocatalytic H2 evolution experiments
Photocatalytic H2 evolution experiments were performed using a PCX50C Discover multi-channel photocatalytic reaction system (Beijing Perfect light Technology Co., Ltd.). A white light-emitting diode (LED) lamp (10 W, 380 nm ≤ λ ≤ 780 nm, 450 mW cm−2) was used as the light source. In a typical procedure, CdS/NF–P was added to a quartz reactor (60 mL) containing 25 mL 10 vol% LA aqueous solution. Before light irradiation, the reaction system was completely degassed by evacuation to remove the oxygen in the reactor and dissolve in the solution. After removing dissolved oxygen by repeated withdrawal-N2 filling processes, the reaction suspension was irradiated under stirring for photocatalytic H2 evolution. The amount of evolved H2 was determined by gas chromatography (GC) (Techcomp, GC-7900) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), a 5 Å molecular sieve column (4 mm × 5 m) and N2 as the carrier gas.
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were carried out in a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell using a CHI660E potentiostat. A Pt mesh (1 cm × 1 cm) and saturated Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. CdS/NF–P was used as the working electrode. 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution was used as the supporting electrolyte. During the test, N2 gas was bubbled continuously to remove oxygen. The electrocatalytic H2 evolution activity of CdS/NF–P was studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scanning rate of 0.5 mV s−1. After all the applied potentials were corrected by IR, E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.2142 V was used as the potential calibration of the reversible hydrogen electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out at a bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl with an AC amplitude of 5 mV and a frequency range of 10–100 mHz. For photoelectrochemical measurements, a 300 W Xe lamp with a cut-off filter of 420 nm was used as a light source. The photocurrent response of the samples was measured using an amperometric current–time technique at a bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl.
Results and discussion
It has been noted that the surface of the framework of the pristine nickel foam (NF) substrate is smooth with a limited number of defects,16 and thus the growth of the photocatalyst particles on pristine NF is unfavourable, thereby leading to inferior activity. To solve this problem, we propose here a two-step synthesis process to prepare the photocatalyst foam. NF was subjected to gas-phase phosphidation using NaH2PO2 as the P source to generate a rough Ni2P layer (denoted as NF–P) on its surface.20,21 Afterward, CdS particles were grown on NF–P through a hydrothermal reaction to obtain the CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam (Fig. 1). The formation of the Ni2P layer not only is beneficial for the efficient growth of the photocatalyst, but also can make full use of the nickel source provided by NF to generate efficient cocatalyst Ni2P.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the preparation of the CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam. 
The microstructure and morphology evolution during the synthesis of the CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam were tracked by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the pristine NF possesses a continuous 3D interconnected framework with a large number of exposed macropores of 200 to 500 nm. After phosphorization, the obtained NF–P maintains the 3D skeleton of the pristine NF (Fig. 2c). However, the surface of NF–P is rough compared to that of pristine NF due to the formation of the Ni2P layer (Fig. 2d). Fig. S1† shows the elemental maps of the Ni and P in NF–P, indicating that Ni and P are evenly distributed on the whole sample, which confirms the formation of a dense Ni2P layer. Fig. 2e and f show the SEM images of the CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam. Obviously, the Ni2P layer is completely covered after the growth of CdS particles. The high-magnification SEM image shows that the grown CdS particles on NF–P are microspheres with a uniform size of 200 nm (Fig. 2f). In contrast, the pristine CdS particles are aggregated microspheres with sizes ranging from 300 to 500 nm (Fig. S2†). In addition, when pristine NF was used as a support in place of NF–P for the growth of CdS, it is found that the grown CdS particles on NF in the resulting CdS/NF sample are compacted and severely aggregated with a much larger size (Fig. S3†). These results indicate that the NF–P foam as a large-surface-area support is effective in confining the growth of CdS particles with reduced size and enhanced dispersion. Fig. 2g shows the SEM image of CdS/NF–P and the corresponding EDX elemental maps. The uniform distribution of Cd and S elements on the surface further illustrates the successful loading of CdS microspheres. At the same time, the distribution of the P element is consistent with that of the Ni element, which indicates that the Ni2P layer is still retained in the resulting photocatalyst foam.

Fig. 3a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of NF, NF–P, and CdS/NF–P samples. For pristine NF, the diffraction peaks occur at 2θ of 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.4°, corresponding to the diffractions of the (111), (200) and (220) crystal planes of the metallic Ni phase (JCPDS: 04-0850), respectively.22 In the XRD diffraction pattern of the NF–P sample, in addition to the metal Ni phase, several new diffraction peaks were also found, all of which belong to the hexagonal Ni2P (JCPDS no. 74-1385).23 This result confirms the formation of a highly crystallized Ni2P layer on the NF substrate, which provides a guarantee for the subsequent growth of CdS on NF–P. The CdS/NF–P sample shows an identical diffraction pattern to the pristine CdS (JCPDS no. 41-1049),24 and the intensities of all peaks increase with the increase of the precursor content (Fig. 3b). In addition, the diffraction peak of Ni2P at 2θ of 47.36° is still retained in the synthesized photocatalyst foams. These indicate that CdS microspheres are successfully grown on the surfaces of the NF–P foam, resulting in a CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam with heterojunction interfaces. Note that no other peaks related to NiSx species can be detected, indicating that the Ni2P layer is stable and cannot be sulfurized during the growth of CdS microspheres.

The elemental composition and chemical states of the samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 4a shows the survey XPS spectra of the NF–P, pristine CdS and CdS/NF–P photocatalytic foam. Compared to the NF–P and pristine CdS, Ni, P, Cd and S elements can be clearly observed in the CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam, which is consistent with the observation of EDX element maps, further confirming the successful growth of CdS on NF–P foam. In the CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cd 3d shows that the Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 peaks are located at 405.1 eV and 412.1 eV respectively, which are derived from Cd2+ in CdS (Fig. 4b).25 Meanwhile, the spectrum of S 2p can be fitted into two peaks at 161.8 eV and 162.9 eV (Fig. 4c), which can be attributed to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 of S2−, respectively.26 In comparison with the pristine CdS, both of the Cd 3d and S 2p peaks in the CdS/NF–P photocatalytic foam shift to the high binding energy region by 0.3 eV. Fig. 4d shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p for NF–P and CdS/NF–P samples. As for the NF–P sample, two Ni species can be distinguished in the prepared NF–P sample. The Ni 2p3/2 peak for Ni–P species is found at 852.5 eV, while this is 856.3 eV for Ni–O species originating from surface oxidation of Ni2P when exposed to air during the testing.27 This result further indicates the formation of the Ni2P layer on NF. After the growth of CdS microspheres, both of the Ni–P (852.1 eV) and Ni–O (855.8 eV) peaks in the Ni 2p spectrum of the CdS/NF–P sample exhibit a reduced intensity and shift to the low binding energy region by 0.4 eV compared to that of the NF–P sample (Fig. 4d). These results clearly indicate the efficient electron transfer from CdS to the Ni2P layer, which would ensure a strong interaction between the two for promoting charge separation, thus enhancing the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity.

Fig. 5a shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis-DRS) of pristine CdS, NF, NF–P and CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foams. Due to the inherent metallic nature of the foam substrate, both of the NF and NF–P samples show strong absorption in the range of 300–800 nm.28 The difference is that the absorption intensity of the NF–P sample is significantly stronger than that of the NF sample, indicating that the Ni2P layer is generated on the surface of NF. The pristine CdS particles show a strong optical absorption in the range of 300–550 nm with a band gap (Eg) of 2.25 eV (Fig. 5b).29,30 It is worth noting that all photocatalyst foams exhibit intrinsic band-gap absorption similar to the pristine CdS nanoparticles, indicating that the presence of NF–P has no effect on the intrinsic optical properties of CdS (Fig. 5b).31 However, it can be observed that the light absorption intensity of all photocatalyst foams in the long wavelength region beyond 550 nm is significantly higher than that of the pristine CdS, which can be attributed to the presence of the Ni2P layer, further indicating that the CdS is successfully integrated on NF–P.

The photocatalytic HER activity of the samples was evaluated under visible light irradiation with 10 vol% LA as the sacrificial reagent. As shown in Fig. 6a, both of the NF and NF–P samples are totally inert for the photocatalytic HER due to the lack of photoactive materials for light absorption. The pristine CdS particles dispersed in the reaction solution exhibit a very low activity due to the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers.32 In striking contrast, the CdS/NF–P-0.25 photocatalyst foam exhibits a significantly enhanced H2 evolution activity, which is much higher than that of dispersed CdS particles. This activity enhancement may be ascribed to the good light-capturing capability of high-density CdS microspheres and the excellent catalytic H2 evolution activity of the Ni2P layer. This hypothesis was confirmed by a control experiment, where the CdS particles directly grown on pristine NF (CdS/NF) exhibit much inferior activity to CdS/NF–P-0.25 due to the low loading of CdS particles (∼1 mg) and the lack of the catalytically active sites for the HER. In addition, when CdS particles were physically loaded on the NF–P foam at the same loading as CdS/NF–P-0.25, the resulting CdS + NF–P-0.25 also shows much inferior activity to CdS/NF–P-0.25. This result clearly verifies that the strong interaction between CdS and the Ni2P layer is crucial for enhancing the photocatalytic HER activity.

(b) Time courses of photocatalytic H2 evolution on CdS/NF–P-n. The inset shows the corresponding loading amount of the CdS. (c) Specific H2 evolution rates on CdS/NF–P-n.

(f) The stability test of photocatalytic H2 evolution on the CdS/NF–P-0.25 photocatalyst foam over 35 h of repeated reactions. 

Fig. 6b shows the effect of CdS loading amount on the photocatalytic HER performance of the obtained photocatalyst foam. It can be clearly seen that the loading amount of CdS on the NF–P foam increases from 2 mg to 5.8 mg (inset of Fig. 6b) with the increase of addition amount of precursor during the synthesis, as a result, the photocatalytic HER activity of the resulting photocatalyst foams also increases accordingly. However, further increasing the loading amount of CdS to 6.9 mg results in a decreased photocatalytic HER activity. Fig. S4† shows the SEM images of the CdS/NF–P samples with different loading amounts of CdS. When the loading amount of CdS is in the range of 2 to 5.8 mg, the generated CdS microspheres are found to be uniformly distributed on the surface of NF–P and the density of CdS microspheres increases, which is beneficial for enhancing the light-capturing capability of the photocatalyst foam, thus leading to an enhanced photocatalytic HER activity. However, when excessive CdS microspheres are loaded, they tend to form large aggregates and are easy to detach from the substrate, which greatly reduces the visible light absorption efficiency per unit area and thus lowers the photocatalytic HER activity. Furthermore, given that the resulting CdS/NF–P-0.25 exhibits extensive visible light absorption beyond the band-gap threshold, the H2 evolution activity of CdS/NF–P-0.25 under long-wavelength visible light irradiation was also evaluated. As shown in Fig. S5,† CdS/NF–P-0.25 exhibits no activity towards H2 evolution when irradiated with light with wavelengths longer than 520 nm. This clearly indicates that the light absorption ability of CdS governs the photocatalytic HER and the enhanced light absorption originating from NF–P can hardly contribute to the observed high activity on CdS/NF–P-0.25.

Fig. 6c compares the intrinsic photocatalytic HER activities of the photocatalyst foams. It can be seen that the CdS/NF–P-0.25 photocatalyst foam has the highest specific photocatalytic HER activity, and the H2 evolution rate reaches 4.82 mmol h−1 gCdS−1, which is about 5 times that of the pristine CdS particles dispersed in the reaction solution. The excellent photocatalytic HER activity of the CdS/NF–P-0.25 photocatalyst foam can be attributed to the maximum and uniform loading of CdS microspheres, all of which can result in efficient utilization of incident visible light per unit area and maximize the interaction between CdS particles and NF–P, thus greatly improving the photocatalytic HER activity. Notably, the activity of CdS/NF–P-0.25 is also among one of the best reported values for CdS-based photocatalysts (Table S1†) under visible light. Fig. 6d shows the photocatalytic HER performance of the CdS/NF–P-0.25 photocatalyst foam irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp with a cutoff filter of 420 nm. Upon irradiation, a large number of H2 bubbles can be produced on the surface of the CdS/NF–P-0.25 photocatalyst foam, further demonstrating its high photocatalytic HER activity (Video S1†). In addition, it is found that the photocatalyst foam can adhere to the magnetic stir bar during the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction. On the one hand, the adhesion of the photocatalyst foam on the stir bar can form a rotating photocatalyst, which can quickly release H2 during the photocatalytic HER process, which is important for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst foam. On the other hand, this means that the CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam can be magnetically separated from the reaction solution for reuse (Fig. 6e), avoiding the tedious separation process employed for dispersed photocatalytic systems, making this photocatalyst foam more attractive for industrial application.
The stability of CdS/NF–P-0.25 toward the photocatalytic HER was then investigated by carrying out seven cycles of repeated experiments (5 h for each cycle). As shown in Fig. 6f, the CdS/NF–P-0.25 photocatalyst foam only shows a gradually decreased HER activity during the first 3 runs, and the activity of the third round of the HER was about 70% of the first run. After that, the activity of the foam keeps stable during the following runs, indicating the good stability. The XRD pattern of the CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam after the stability test is completely consistent with that of the fresh photocatalyst foam, indicating that the phase structure of the photocatalyst foam does not change (Fig. 7a). From the SEM images of used CdS/NF–P-0.25, it can be seen that the CdS particles on the NF–P surface are still intact (Fig. 7b–d). In addition, the XPS analysis (Fig. S6†) indicates that the chemical states of Cd and S of the used CdS/NF–P-025 photocatalyst foam are similar to those of the fresh one. However, during the photocatalytic HER, the peak intensity of Ni–P species is reduced most likely due to the partial oxidation of Ni2P on the surface.33

In order to reveal the origin of the enhanced photocatalytic HER on the CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam, a series of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements were performed. Fig. 8a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the samples recorded in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution. It can be seen that the pristine NF exhibits a very low electrocatalytic activity for H2 evolution even at larger overpotentials. After phosphidation, the resulting NF–P shows enhanced HER activity compared to NF due to the formation of the Ni2P layer on the surface. Pristine CdS particles also exhibit limited HER activity due to the lack of active sites for H2 evolution. In contrast to the pristine CdS, the CdS/NF–P-0.25 foam electrode shows a significantly enhanced cathodic current for the HER. In parallel, when CdS particles were physically loaded on the NF–P surface, the electrocatalytic HER activity of resulting CdS + NF–P-0.25 is enhanced relative to pristine CdS but still much lower than that of CdS/NF–P-0.25. These results indicate that the formed heterojunction interfaces between CdS microspheres and the Ni2P layer are highly active for the HER.34 In addition, as evidenced by XPS analysis, when CdS microspheres are in situ grown on the Ni2P layer, there is direct electron transfer from CdS to Ni2P, which would also beneficial for enhancing the HER activity of the photocatalyst foam. Fig. 8b shows the Nyquist plots of the samples obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. All of the pristine NF, pristine CdS, and NF–P exhibit a larger semicircle radius in the medium frequency region due to the large interfacial electron transfer resistance (Rct). After loading CdS microspheres on NF–P, the resulting CdS/NF–P-0.25 foam electrode shows greatly reduced Rct compared to pristine CdS and NF–P electrodes, which is also much smaller than that of the CdS + NF–P-0.25 electrode. This result further confirms that the formation of multiple heterojunction interfaces between NF–P and CdS significantly reduces the charge transfer resistance, which partly accounts for the observed HER activity improvement for the CdS/NF–P-0.25 photocatalyst foam. The reduced resistance for electron transfer would also benefit efficient charge separation under light irradiation. To verify this hypothesis, the transient photocurrent responses of the samples were measured in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution at a bias of 0 V under chopped visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 8c, the photocurrent responses of NF and NF–P electrodes are negligible because they cannot absorb light to produce charge carriers due to their metallic nature. When CdS particles are loaded on NF, an obvious photocurrent response can be observed on the resulting CdS + NF electrode but the density is relatively low due to the rapid charge recombination in CdS particles. When CdS was simply loaded on NF–P, the resulting CdS + NF–P-0.25 shows an enhanced photocurrent response relative to the CdS + NF-0.25 electrode. This indicates that the Ni2P layer on the NF substrate can effectively accept the photogenerated electrons in CdS to suppress the charge recombination. Compared to the CdS + NF–P-0.25 electrode, the photocurrent response of the CdS/NF–P-0.25 electrode is further enhanced, indicating that the charge recombination in the CdS/NF–P-0.25 foam can be effectively suppressed due to the formation of multiple heterojunction interfaces for direct electron transfer.34 The enhanced charge separation efficiency of CdS/NF–P-0.25 was further confirmed by the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) analysis. As shown in Fig. 8d, pristine CdS shows a strong and wide emission band centered at 550 nm upon excitation, which can be ascribed to the radiative recombination of electron–hole pairs in CdS. In contrast, the PL emissions of the CdS + NF-0.25 and CdS + NF–P-0.25 foams are obviously quenched, which is due to the efficient electron transfer from excited CdS to metallic NF and NF–P. Notably, the quenching efficiency of CdS/NF–P-0.25 is much higher than that of CdS + NF–P-0.25, indicating that the recombination rate of photogenerated carriers is significantly reduced,35 which further proves that the effective heterogeneous interfaces formed between CdS and NF–P in the CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam are favorable for promoting charge separation,36 and in turn enhancing the photocatalytic activity.

Based on the above experimental results, a photocatalytic mechanism is proposed to rationalize the excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution activity obtained on the CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam (Fig. 9). Upon visible light irradiation, the CdS in the CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam can be excited to produce electrons (e−) and holes (h+).37 Benefitting from the multiple interface heterojunctions among the NF substrate, in situ grown Ni2P layer, and CdS microspheres, the photogenerated electrons generated in the conduction band (CB) of CdS can rapidly transfer to the Ni2P layer and then to NF, leaving the holes in the valence band (VB) of CdS, and efficient separation of photogenerated carriers is achieved. At the same time, after photogenerated electrons being transferred to the active sites on the Ni2P layer, the protons in the aqueous solution are efficiently reduced to form H2.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed an effective strategy to prepare a CdS-based photocatalyst foam by directly growing CdS microspheres on Ni2P layer-modified nickel foam (CdS/NF–P) for splitting water to produce H2 under visible light irradiation. The rough Ni2P thin layer on the NF substrate cannot only provide effective anchoring sites for the growth of high-density CdS microspheres for maximizing light absorption ability but also serve as an efficient electron acceptor and cocatalyst to promote charge separation and the photocatalytic HER. Benefitting from these structural merits, the resulting CdS/NF–P shows enhanced activity toward the photocatalytic HER under visible light, which is even much higher than that of CdS particles suspended in the reaction solution. More importantly, the CdS/NF–P photocatalyst foam can be readily recovered after reaction by simple magnetic separation and reused for several cycling reactions without significant activity loss. This work provides a new insight into the design and development of highly active and practical photocatalyst foams for large-scale photochemical energy conversion.
