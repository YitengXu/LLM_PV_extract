    , Accepted 11th September 2017First published on 13th September 2017AbstractLarge-scale energy storage technologies are in high demand for effective utilization of intermittent electricity generations and efficient electric power transmission. The feasibility of lithium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage is under debate due to the scarcity and uneven distribution of lithium resources in the Earth's crust. Therefore, there arises tremendous interest in pursuing alternative energy storage systems based on earth-abundant materials. Recently, non-aqueous potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) are emerging as a promising energy storage system due to the abundance of potassium and the encouraging battery performance. Here, the recent research progress in non-aqueous KIBs is summarized, including electrode materials, electrolytes, battery architectures and fundamental electrochemical processes. The challenges and future research opportunities are also briefly discussed.
1. Introduction
The global energy production is undergoing a rapid transition from traditional fossil fuels to clean and renewable resources such as solar and wind energies, which typically require low-cost and high-performance energy storage systems. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the state-of-the-art power sources for portable electronics and electric vehicles, have been viewed as one of the most promising technologies for large-scale energy storage applications.1 However, it is still an open question whether or not LIBs are feasible for such applications due to the limited resources (0.0017 wt%) and uneven distribution of lithium in the Earth's crust.2 Therefore, alternative energy storage technologies with low cost, high energy, a long cycle life and using earth-abundant materials are highly desirable for large-scale energy storage applications.
Owing to the abundance (2.36 wt%)2 and easy accessibility of sodium, sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) as promising alternatives to LIBs have been intensively studied in recent years for potential low-cost energy storage systems.3 However, the larger radius of Na+ ions (1.02 Å), in contrast to that of Li+ ions (0.76 Å),4 causes significant challenges in the development of NIBs.3–5 Firstly, the bigger ions need more space to host and cause larger volume changes during the sodiation/desodiation processes, which leads to poor cycling performance and limited selection of host materials. Another potential disadvantage of NIBs is the more positive standard electrochemical potential of Na+/Na (−2.71 V vs. Standard Hydrogen Electrode, SHE) compared with that of Li+/Li (−3.04 V vs. SHE),6 which decreases the voltages of NIBs and thus reduces energy.
Potassium is abundant in the Earth's crust (2.09 wt%)2 and has similar chemical properties to sodium and lithium, but with an even larger ion radius (1.38 Å).4 Therefore, the investigation of K+ ions as charge carriers has been hindered for the similar reasons in the development of NIBs. A major breakthrough in research was recently made by Ji and coworkers by demonstration of reversible electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation of K+ ions in graphite, which proved the feasibility to transfer the well-developed LIBs to a low-cost K-ion battery (KIB) system.7 In addition, the standard potential of K+/K (−2.93 V vs. SHE) is lower than that of Na+/Na (−2.71 V vs. SHE),6 promising a higher operation voltage of KIBs and thereby offering more energy.8 Furthermore, in liquid electrolytes, the lower charge density of K+ ions induces smaller solvated cations, thus enabling a fast ionic conductivity and high power.9 Very encouraging results have been demonstrated for non-aqueous KIBs recently, such as a high voltage, fast rate capability and a long cycle life,7,9–21 making KIBs a strong competitor to NIBs and even LIBs. In this review paper, an overview about the emerging non-aqueous KIBs is presented, including electrode materials, electrolytes, battery architectures and fundamental electrochemical processes. The challenges and future research opportunities for non-aqueous KIBs are also discussed.
2. Comparison between KIBs, NIBs and LIBs

Table 1 compares the properties of the elements of Li, Na, and K and the electrochemical properties of selected electrode materials. The remarkable merit of potassium is its abundance in the Earth's crust, which is similar to Na but more than three orders of magnitude higher than Li. This promises a sufficient supply and low cost of raw materials. The prices of industrial grade metals are 800000 Chinese Yuan (CNY) per ton for lithium, 21000 CNY per ton for sodium and 90000 CNY for potassium.22 The price of potassium is slightly higher than sodium but one order of magnitude lower than lithium. This warrants the feasibility of mass manufacture and widespread adoption of KIBs. However, there are concerns on the decreased theoretical gravimetric capacity (685 mA h g−1) due to the heavier atomic mass of K compared with those of Li (3861 mA h g−1) and Na (1166 mA h g−1).3 Nevertheless, alkali elements account for a small portion of the total molecular mass of a compound, meaning a much smaller difference in the theoretical gravimetric capacities of the compounds (Table 1). For instance, assuming that one-electron redox reaction occurs, the theoretical capacities of the fluorosulfates of LiFeSO4F, NaFeSO4F and KFeSO4F are 150.7, 138.2 and 127.6 mA h g−1, respectively.23 The theoretical capacity of the K-containing compound is only 15.3% less than that of the Li-containing one, far smaller than the 6-fold difference for the alkali metals. Other concerns are the potential safety hazards caused by the high chemical reactivity of potassium and the impacts of volume changes on the electrode structures upon insertion/extraction of K+ ions.

The slightly lower specific capacity of the K-containing electrode materials can be compensated by the higher voltage. The standard reduction potential of K+/K (−2.93 V) is higher than that of Li+/Li (−3.04 V) but lower than that of Na+/Na (−2.71 V).6 However, the desolvation processes of solvated Li cations in liquid solvents require more energy due to the higher charge density and coordination effects of Li+ ions with solvent molecules, causing a higher redox potential of Li+/Li.8,25 For example, in the solvent of propylene carbonate (PC), K+/K displays a redox potential of −2.88 V, lower than both Li+/Li (−2.79 V) and Na+/Na (−2.56 V).6 In the mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC), a widely-used mixed solvent for commercial LIBs, the redox potential of K+/K is also 0.15 V lower than that of Li+/Li.9 The lower redox potential of K+/K gives higher operation voltages of KIBs and thus ensures higher energy. It has been observed that the potential of K+ intercalation/deintercalation in KFeSO4F is 4.0 V vs. K+/K, higher than 3.7 V of LiFeSO4F (vs. Li+/Li) and 3.4 V of NaFeSO4F (vs. Na+/Na).23
Another merit of K+ ions as charge carriers is the higher ionic conductivity in contrast with Li and Na ions in liquid electrolyte systems. As a result of the lower charge density, the larger K+ ions result in lower Lewis acidity and smaller solvated cations in liquid electrolytes,6,9 rendering a higher transference number and mobility of K+ ions than those of Li+ and Na+ ions.9 Previous studies have identified higher conductivity of K+ ions in both aqueous/non-aqueous electrolytes.9,26–28 K carriers have been widely adopted in aqueous batteries.27–29 In organic electrolytes, such as EC:DEC solvents, K+ ions also show a higher ionic conductivity than Li+ and Na+ ions.9 Furthermore, the lower desolvation energy of K+ ions in liquid electrolytes can facilitate ion insertion into electrode materials (Table 1),26 further enhancing the kinetics of potassiation and thereby rate capability.9,30
3. Anode materials for KIBs
3.1. Carbon anodes
The failure of the first commercialized Li battery launched in 1980s was caused by Li metal anodes, mainly originating from the dendrite generation during cycling processes.31 The success of the current rechargeable Li batteries is attributed to the replacement of Li metal anodes with graphite, where lithium graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) form instead of Li plating/stripping, avoiding growth of Li dendrites and providing a safe operation.31 Although stable potassium GICs have been reported in the middle of the 19th century,32 carbon materials were not investigated as KIB anodes until the work reported in 2014 by Wang and coworkers. They first demonstrated the reversible insertion/extraction of K+ ions into/from carbon nanofibers.33 However, the large volume expansion causes severe structure deformation and a fast capacity decay. The realization of graphite anodes in KIBs was first reported in 2015, where Ji's group demonstrated the electrochemically reversible intercalation of K+ ions in graphite anodes with a capacity of 273 mA h g−1,7 close to the theoretical value of 279 mA h g−1 for fully intercalated KC8. XRD measurements confirmed the phase transition from KC36 (Stage III) to KC24 (Stage II) to KC8 (Stage I) upon K+ ion intercalation. A theoretical study, however, found that the stage transition from KC24 to KC16 to KC8 is energetically more stable, which is like the lithiation of graphite.7,34 To clearly understand the K intercalation into graphite, further investigation is required.
One advantage of the graphite anodes for KIBs is the higher plateau voltage, 0.23 V vs. K+/K, which is higher than that of lithium in graphite (0.1 V vs. Li+/Li). This may lower the risk of metal plating/stripping and provide a new way to circumvent the safety issues related to the dendrite growth of lithium metal at a low voltage in LIBs.
Another challenge is the large volume change (60%) during the potassiation/depotassiation reactions (Fig. 1a), which posts significant stress on the electrodes and leads to fast capacity degradation and low initial Coulombic efficiencies. The volume change can be at least partially alleviated by choosing appropriate binders and electrolytes. A good cycling stability with 89% capacity retention after 200 cycles was achieved when the sodium alginate binder was used for graphite anodes (Fig. 1b).20 Because a protection layer can be formed when using Na-alginate, sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMCNa) and sodium polyacrylate (PANa) binders, higher initial Coulombic efficiencies were observed for the graphite KIB anodes compared with the poly(vinylydene fluoride) (PVDF) binder.9,20

Because of the slow diffusion kinetics of large K+, graphite anodes suffer poor rate capability.20 To improve the kinetics and rate capability, a variety of nano structures of carbon materials have been developed. Three-dimensional graphitic carbon networks were prepared from metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).35 It was found that the particle size of the MOF precursors plays a critical role in determining the structure and morphology of the resulting carbons. Graphitic carbon networks were only produced for nanosized precursor particles of <100 nm due to the catalysis of the large amount of cobalt nanoparticles formed near the surface. For larger precursor particles in micro-sizes, amorphous carbon particles were produced. As a result of the reduced ion diffusion distance for the nano-sized carbon fibers, good rate performance was achieved with a capacity retention of 100 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 2000 mA g−1, compared with the negligible capacity retention for the amorphous carbon particles at the same current density.
Electrospun porous carbon nanofiber (CNF) paper anodes (Fig. 2a) were demonstrated with an extremely high rate performance and superior cycling stability.36 The CNF paper anodes delivered a high reversible capacity of 270 mA h g−1 and a very low decay rate of 0.01% per cycle over 1200 cycles (Fig. 2b), which are much better than those for most anode materials in KIBs and even in sodium-ion batteries. A high capacity retention of 100 mA h g−1 was achieved even at an ultra-high current rate of 7.7 A g−1 (Fig. 2c). The superior performance is attributed to the unique structures of the CNFs, including (1) the porous and robust structure can effectively alleviate the volume expansion induced by the insertion of large K ions; (2) the three-dimensional interconnected network provides fast kinetics and a 3D electron transport pathway; (3) the nanostructure reduces the K ion diffusion distance.

Introduction of heteroatoms is an efficient way to improve the conductivity of the carbon materials, such as N and O. Chen et al. reported hierarchically porous nitrogen-doped carbon microspheres (NCSs) for KIB anodes.37 The potassium storage is mainly contributed by the surface capacitive storage mechanism on the surface and near surface area, which warrants a fast kinetics. A high capacity retention of 154 mA h g−1 at an ultra-high current rate of 72C was delivered with no obvious capacity decay after 4000 cycles at 1.8C. High rate capability was also observed for O and N doped carbon fibers and N and F doped graphene layers for KIB anodes.38–40 The heteroatom doping not only enhances the rate performance but also creates numerous structure vacancies and defects which serve as potassium storage sites to increase the specific capacity. P and O dual-doping graphene could even reach a reversible capacity of 566.6 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, which is much higher than those of the other carbon anodes in KIBs. A long cycling performance of 600 cycles at 2000 mA g−1 was obtained with a negligible capacity decay.41 So far, the potassium storage mechanism of the hateroatom-doped carbon anodes has not been studied, and therefore further investigation is required.
Superior rate performance was also observed for hard carbon (HC) anodes in KIBs.11 The microporous structure and the enlarged interlayer space of the HCs are believed to facilitate K+ insertion and diffusion in the HC anodes. The HC anodes are capable of delivering reversible capacities of >250 mA h g−1 at 1/10C in KIBs. Although it is slightly lower than the capacity of ∼300 mA h g−1 reported in NIBs, much better rate performance was obtained, retaining 190 mA h g−1 at 2C and 136 mA h g−1 at 5C, while only 97 mA h g−1 and 73 mA h g−1 for NIBs, respectively (Fig. 3). No obvious difference in the interlayer space of graphene layers was observed during the charge/discharge processes in the TEM measurement,42 which may suggest that K ions are not intercalated between graphene layers like Li ion intercalation in graphite. Instead, they may be adsorbed at defective and deposited in nanoporous structures.

3.2. Alloy anodes
Alloy electrode materials generally have high storage capacity for alkali metals, making them very attractive for high energy rechargeable batteries. For example, the theoretical Li storage capacity is as high as 4200 mA h g−1 in Si, 1600 mA h g−1 in Ge and 990 mA h g−1 in Sn, respectively.43 To date, very little investigation has been conducted on alloy anode materials in KIBs. Sb was reported to deliver a reversible capacity of 650 mA h g−1 at a current density of 35 mA g−1 by forming K3Sb alloy in KIBs (Fig. 4),44 more than two times higher than those of carbon materials. However, the cycling performance has been little investigated.

As a well-known alloy anode material, Sn has been intensively investigated for LIBs and NIBs. In LIBs and NIBs, alloys in the forms of Li4.4Sn and Na15Sn4 are produced, yielding theoretical capacities of 993 mA h g−1 and 845 mA h g−1, respectively.43,45 As a KIB anode, it was found that one Sn atom can accept only one K atom to form an alloy of KSn, corresponding to a capacity of 226 mA h g−1. In addition, the Sn anodes suffer a huge volume change of ∼197% during the K ion insertion/extraction. This severely damages the electrode structure and leads to a fast capacity degradation as reported in previous work.45,46 The pulverization of Sn particles can be partially alleviated by using Sn4P3 alloy, for which a two-step reaction was proposed for K storage. Firstly, a conversion reaction between P and K occurred to form K3−xP, which broke Sn into particles and dispersed in the matrix of K3−xP. Secondly, an alloy reaction of Sn with K occurred to produce KSn (Fig. 5). The two-step reaction helps to buffer the stress caused by the big volume changes. Unfortunately, although a high reversible capacity of 384.8 mA h g−1 was obtained, a still limited cycle life of 50 cycles was presented with a quick capacity drop after 35 cycles.47

3.3. Organic anodes
In contrast to the inorganic materials, organic molecules host many advantages, such as flexible structure design, facile synthesis, nontoxicity and renewability, making them very attractive as electrochemical energy storage materials. Intensive investigations into organic electrode materials have been conducted for LIBs and NIBs.48,49 Recently, appealing electrochemical performance was demonstrated on organic anode materials for KIBs. Dipotassium terephthalate (K2TP) contains conjugated carboxylate groups that can electrochemically accept one K+ ion for each group (Fig. 6a), offering a theoretical capacity of 221 mA h g−1.17,21 Although it is slightly lower than those of its counterparts of lithium and sodium terephthalates in LIBs50 and NIBs,51 a high reversible capacity of 249 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 was achieved, higher than 234 mA h g−1 of LIBs and 180 mA h g−1 of NIBs.50,52 A good cycling stability was demonstrated by a 94.6% capacity retention after 500 cycles with a 100% Coulombic efficiency (Fig. 6b). The operation voltage is 0.6 V vs. K+/K, well above the plating voltage of K, thus enhancing the safety of KIBs contrasting with NIBs. Full KIBs using all organic electrode materials, oxocarbon salt (K2(CO)6) as cathodes and dipotassium terephthalate (K2TP) as anodes, were constructed and delivered an energy density of 52 W h kg−1.21 Although the performance is needed to be improved, it encourages the research and development of KIBs and expands the designability of the battery configurations.

3.4. Other anode materials
The Ti-based MXene nanosheets, including Ti2C(OH)2, Ti2CO2, Ti3C2 and Ti3CNTz, were reported to show the capability to store potassium ions.53–56 An impressive long cycle life of 900 cycles at 200 mA g−1 was identified on the Ti3C2 anodes.55 Some potassium titanates, K2Ti8O17,57 K2Ti4O958,59 and KTi2(PO4)3,60 were reported as potential KIB anodes, but they all suffer a fast capacity decay, and delivered lower capacities,57,60 compared with carbon anodes. In addition to the Ti-based materials, metal sulphides such as MoS2 and SnS2,61,62 and metal oxides, including MoO3 nanobundles63,64 and Co3O4–Fe2O3/C composites,65 were also tested as KIB anode materials with promising electrochemical performance.
4. Cathode materials for KIBs
4.1. Hexacyanoferrates
Hexacyanoferrates formed by octahedrally coordinating transition metals with cyanides have a metal–ligand open framework, which forms a large space and enables facile intercalation and diffusion of large metal ions. Furthermore, the hexacyanoferrates are made of earth-abundant elements, mainly Fe and Mn, which ensures cost-effective raw materials for KIBs and promotes the large-scale applications. The representative structure of hexacyanoferrate cathodes in non-aqueous KIBs is KM[Fe(CN)6]y·(nH2O), where M could be Fe, Ni, Cu, Co and Mn.19,66–70 Here, the hexacyanoferrates are denoted as K-MHCFes. The storage reactions of K ions in K-MHCFes are based on the redox couples of FeIII/FeII and/or MIII/MII.71 When M = Mn, the potassium storage capability is superior to the K-MHCFes with other transition metals, such as higher voltage and thus higher energy density.19,66 When nanosized K-FeHCFes are prepared and employed for KIB cathodes, a high energy density of >500 W h kg−1 can be achieved,69 comparable with those of LiCoO2 cathodes in LIBs.
Fast intercalation capability and a long cycle life of hexacyanoferrate cathodes have been demonstrated in NIBs with both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes.28,72 For non-aqueous KIBs, the pioneering work was conducted on KFeIIIFeII(CN)6 (Prussian blue, PB).73 A discharge voltage of 3.7 V was presented, higher than those of its analogues for NIB cathodes (∼3.2 V).72 A relatively lower reversible capacity of ∼78 mA h g−1 (close to the theoretical capacity of 87.5 mA h g−1) was presented but a good cycling performance with 88% capacity retention after 500 cycles.73 Higher specific capacities were achieved on KxMnFe(CN)6 (x ≈ 2) cathodes (Fig. 7a),19 where the two-electron reaction of MnIII/MnII and FeIII/FeII redox couples gives rise to a theoretical capacity of 156 mA h g−1, double that of the PB cathodes. A high discharge voltage of 3.6 V and a high reversible capacity of 142 mA h g−1 at 0.2C make it much promising and highly competitive when compared with its analogues for LIB and NIB cathode materials (Fig. 7b). The increase in the K content of K-MHCFes can also enhance the capacity as evidenced by K1.75Mn[FeII(CN)6]0.93·0.16H2O and K1.64Fe[FeII(CN)6]0.89·0.15H2O with higher K contents, compared with K0.22Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.805·4.01H2O with a lower one.66,70 One disadvantage of these K-M2HCFes is that the Fe(CN)64− vacancy and crystal water may degrade the electrochemical performance. None-K-contained hexacyanoferrates, such as Prussian green (PG, FeFe(CN)6), were also reported to have excellent K storage capabilities. PG as a KIB cathode shows a capacity of ∼120 mA h g−1 at 0.5C, and a high Coulombic efficiency of ∼100% gained over 500 cycles at 5C.68 The good electrochemical performance is associated with the stable crystal structure of hexacyanoferrates. When matched with graphite anodes, the hexacyanoferrate cathodes display relatively higher operation voltages than those of LiCoO2-graphite cells,66 resulting in a high energy density of over 500 W h kg−1 (based on the cathode material).

Considering the resource-abundant raw materials for mass production, the long-term cycling stability with high voltages and moderate capacities makes hexacyanoferrates as a top choice over other cathode materials in KIBs. Compared with Na and Li ions, K ions are preferred for fast transportation in liquid electrolytes for PB electrode materials. A high rate capability and a very long cycle life of ∼107 cycles without obvious degradation have been reported for PB film cathodes in aqueous electrolytes.73,74 In contrast, a fast capacity decay was observed with Li storage.73 The superior performance of K-MHCFe cathodes makes KIBs more promising than LIBs and NIBs.
4.2. Organic cathodes
Compared with hexacyanoferrates, organic cathodes provide higher reversible capacities but inferior cycling stability and cycle life. 3,4,9,10-Perylene-tetracarboxylicacid-dianhydride (PTCDA), a typical organic cathode material for both LIBs and NIBs,75,76 displays a reversible capacity of 131 mA h g−1 with a voltage of 2.5 V as a KIB cathode but suffers a fast capacity decay (Fig. 8).15,16 The slow diffusion of K ions, low electronic conductivity and the repeated phase transition between crystalline and amorphous structures upon potassiation/depotassiation of PTCDA may contribute to the capacity loss.15,16 Different from small organic molecules, polymers have long backbone chains, which can reduce the solubility of the organic electrode materials in the liquid electrolytes. Therefore, enhanced electrochemical performance is expected for polymer cathodes. Poly(anthraquinonyl sulfide) (PAQS) shows a reversible capacity of 200 mA h g−1 as a KIB cathode,14 similar to 220 mA h g−1 in NIBs,77 but much higher than the inorganic cathode materials. The redox process is a two-step reaction as indicated by the two reduction/oxidation peaks in cyclic voltammetry measurements, which is similar to the observations in NIBs. One drawback of the organic electrodes is the low discharge voltage of ∼1.9 V, which may diminish its merit of high capacity.

As a cathode material, sulfur possesses the highest specific capacity and has been intensively studied for application in high energy density battery systems. One sulfur atom can react with two alkali metal ions, yielding a theoretical capacity of 1672 mA h g−1, one order of magnitude higher than those of commercial cathode materials. However, significant challenges have plagued its practical applications, including the electronic insulation nature of sulfur, dissolution of intermediate polysulfides and a large volume change during the electrochemical reactions.78 To tackle these problems, many strategies have been developed for LIBs. One common approach is dispersing or encapsulating sulfur into porous carbon materials and conductive polymers.79,80 Chen et al. reported room temperature K–S batteries using PANI-coated CMK-3/S composite cathodes (Fig. 9a).81 The initial reversible capacity of over 500 mA h g−1 was achieved but underwent a fast capacity decay (Fig. 9b). K2S3 was found to be the main discharge product, which is similar to those in its analogue Na–S batteries with the major discharge products of Na2Sx (x ≥ 2), but quite different from those of Li–S batteries with the final discharge product of Li2S.81 In addition, the sulfur contents in the composites play an important role in determining the performance of the sulfur cathodes in KIBs. For the high sulfur-content composites, extra solid sulfur leads to a low reactivity and thus a low capacity and a fast fading.

To circumvent the shuttling behavior caused by the dissolution of the soluble polysulfides, another efficient way is adopting β”-Al2O3-based inorganic solid electrolytes for high-temperature K–S batteries. The shuttling effects of the polysulfides can be completely eliminated. A high specific capacity of ∼400 mA h g−1 and a long cycle life without noticeable capacity loss after 1000 cycles were achieved, which are much better than those of Li–S batteries using liquid electrolytes.13 Different from the wide-used rechargeable batteries, the K–S batteries operate at a high temperature of 150 °C, where K and sulfur are in molten states. In contrast, Na–S batteries using β”-Al2O3-based solid electrolytes commonly operate at a higher temperature above 300 °C to ensure the wettability of molten Na on the surface of the solid electrolytes.82 Compared with Li–S and Na–S batteries, the excellent cycling stability and rate performance along with the abundant and inexpensive sulfur resources make them more promising for the future grid-scale energy storage applications.
Similar to K–S batteries, K–O2 batteries also feature a high theoretical capacity and an abundant oxygen resource. In Li–O2 and Na–O2 batteries, unstable discharge products of LiO2 and NaO2 are produced,83,84 which has caused significant challenges in developing a viable battery performance. In contrast, in K–O2 batteries, the final discharge product of KO2 is found to be both kinetically and thermodynamically stable. Although the performance of K–O2 batteries still falls below our expectation at this time, it can be improved by optimizing electrolytes and adopting high performance alloy anodes.44,85,86
As a congener of sulfur, selenium (Se) has a higher electronic conductivity, and a better rate performance is expected using Se as a cathode material.87 Unfortunately, Se also faces the same dissolution issues of the high-order polyselenides as those for S cathodes. By confining small Se molecules within the polyacrylonitrile-derived carbon fibers, a stable cycling performance was obtained for the Se cathodes in KIBs with a capacity retention of 396 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles,88 higher than 350 mA h g−1 in its counterpart of LIBs.87 The confinement of Se by the carbon fibers prevents the formation of soluble polyselenides during the potassiation/depotassiation processes, which ensures an enhanced electrochemical performance. However, the low content of active materials, ∼40%, limits the small Se molecule cathodes at a low specific energy if taking account into the host carbon materials.89,90
The problems of the S/Se cathodes are mainly caused by the dissolution of soluble intermediate products of long-chain polysulfides/selenides, which have been realized in Li–S and Na–S batteries. Although many strategies have been developed,90,91 there is no approach that can completely solve these problems. It is still a long way to take the advantage of the high theoretical capacities of S/Se cathodes for a practical room-temperature KIB.
4.4. Other cathode materials
Besides the aforementioned cathode materials, other materials have been studied as cathode materials for KIBs and encouraging performance was presented, such as polyanionic compounds, phosphates and metal oxides. One of the outstanding features of the polyanionic compound cathodes is the higher operation voltages. FeSO4F cathode materials can be prepared by electrochemically removing K from KFeSO4F, and the electrochemical performance was compared against Li, Na and K.23 KFeSO4F shows much higher voltages than its Li- and Na-counterparts (Table 1), implying a higher energy density as a cathode material in KIBs.23
Potassium phosphates have similar structures to fluorosulfates, suggesting the viability of potassium storage materials and potential high voltages. K3V2(PO4)3 shows a high voltage platform of 3.6–3.9 V,12 and KVPO4F and KVOPO4 cathodes reach an even higher voltage of 4 V.92 The K+ ion diffusion coefficient of carbon coated K3V2(PO4)3 cathode materials was measured to be 10−9 cm2 s−1, comparable with those of carbon materials.11 A good stability was delivered with only 3.7% capacity loss after 100 cycles in KIBs.12 Mai et al. used K3V2(PO4)3/C composites as NIB cathodes and obtained an enhanced cycling performance.93
As an analogue of layered LiCoO2, KxCoO2 also permits reversible insertion/extraction of K ions. Haegyeom studied the P2-type K0.6CoO2 cathode materials in KIBs, which show an average voltage of 2.7 V vs. K+/K and delivered a 60% capacity retention after 120 cycles.94 The capacity degradation was found to be associated with the unparalleled phase transition upon the K+ ion insertion/extraction.94–96 Recently, polyoxometalate K0.7Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 was reported as a high performance KIB cathode.18 It delivered a high capacity of 178 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1 (Fig. 10), two times those of polyanionic cathodes.18

5. Electrolytes in KIBs
Electrolytes play a crucial role in rechargeable batteries,31 which has been widely accepted for LIBs and NIBs. When salts are dissolved into electrolyte solvents, the solvation ions are immediately formed. The reaction between these solvated ions and the electrode surface largely determines the battery performance.26 In KIBs, significant influences of electrolytes on the electrochemical performance have been reported. Higher Coulombic efficiencies and better stability were achieved on carbon anodes with the EC:PC and EC:DEC electrolytes than with the EC:dimethyl carbonate (DMC) electrolytes,20 which may be associated with the instability of DMC at a low potential. Besides, electrolyte additives can significantly improve the battery performance, such as fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) in LIBs and NIBs and LiNO3 in Li–S batteries.97–100 In the case of KIBs, enhanced Coulombic efficiencies and cycling capability were reported on hexacyanoferrate cathodes by the addition of FEC in EC:DEC electrolytes.66 For organic electrode materials, ether-based electrolytes show a better electrochemical performance, higher reversible capacities, better rate capability and a longer cycle life, in contrast with carbonate-based electrolytes.21 The reason may be the formation of more stable and highly ionically conductive solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) films with ether-based electrolytes than carbonate-based ones.14,21 Meanwhile, the good wettability of 1,2-dimethoxygethane (DME) electrolytes on K2TP electrodes may contribute to the better performance.21 A similar phenomenon was also observed on the polymer cathodes of PAQS when comparing carbonate- and ether-based electrolytes.14
Although the SEI layer has been identified to be an important factor for the electrochemical performance in LIBs and NIBs, it has been little investigated in KIBs. The quality and properties of the SEI layer are highly dependent on the surface properties of the electrodes and the components of the electrolytes. A uniform SEI on the surface of potassium anodes was formed using a concentrated potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (KFSI)-DME electrolyte, which enables reversible potassium plating/stripping electrochemistry with a high efficiency (∼99%).101 It also showed a wide electrochemical voltage window up to 5 V vs. K+/K and demonstrated good cycling stability with high-voltage PB cathodes. The results bring up the promise for the development of potassium metal battery technologies.
6. Novel battery architectures
The formation of dendrites is one major origin of safety hazards for the high energy metal-ion batteries using organic liquid electrolytes (Li–S and Li–O2 batteries).91,102 Although intensive research has been carried out to suppress or eliminate the dendrite growth, there have been no effective approaches for practical applications. Recently, Goodenough and co-workers reported a new design to address this issue.103 They developed a liquid K–Na alloy anode by adsorbing the liquid K–Na alloy into a porous carbon paper, which can completely eliminate the dendrite problems occurring in the traditional battery configurations of LIBs and NIBs (Fig. 11a). With this anode, a superior cycling performance of over 400 cycles with an acceptable capacity at a high rate was demonstrated on the Na2MnFe(CN)6 cathodes as shown in Fig. 11b. This new concept might open up a new avenue to dendrite-free anodes for future high energy storage systems.

Another attractive design is the K-ion-based dual-ion batteries (DIBs).104–106 The batteries were constructed with a K-ion electrolyte of 1 M KPF6 in EC:DMC:EMC (4:3:2 v/v/v), metal anodes and graphite cathodes, and operate on a K-alloying/dealloying mechanism on the metal anodes and a simultaneous anion insertion/extraction mechanism on the graphite cathodes (Fig. 12a). A long-term cycling stability of 300 cycles was achieved on the K-DIBs with a high operating voltage of 3.0–5.0 V and a high specific energy of 155 W h kg−1 (Fig. 12b), which is comparable with those of commercial LIBs.104 Lu's group reported K-DIBs using graphite anodes and organic cathodes and demonstrated a longer cycling life of up to 500 cycles with a low capacity decay rate of 0.049% per cycle and an initial Coulombic efficiency of 94%.106 The electrode materials used in the DIBs not only have a low price but also are environmentally benign, offering a potential choice for the next generation large-scale and low-cost energy storage.

7. Conclusions and outlook
Herein, we summarize the development of the emerging energy storage chemistry of non-aqueous KIBs mainly in the last two years, focusing on the exploration for electrode materials, electrolyte systems and new battery architectures. The intrinsic properties and electrochemical behaviour are compared between Li, Na and K carriers. Although K+ ions are heavier than Li+ and Na+ ions, leading to lower specific capacity in terms of the relative atomic mass of potassium, but for total assembling batteries, KIBs show higher voltages, faster rate capability and comparable specific capacities of electrode compounds with their counterparts LIBs and NIBs, particularly on carbon anodes, inorganic compound cathodes and organic electrode materials. Logically, the LIBs are hardly superseded by KIBs for the not satisfied practical electrochemical properties, but KIBs potentially save the cost of the batteries by adopting relatively cheaper salts and electrolytes during the manufacture.
The hexacynoferrates, organic compounds and carbon materials are the most promising electrode materials for the practical applications of KIBs. Although some advances have been achieved, further in-depth investigation should be conducted to optimize the electrochemical performance as well as to improve the understanding of the storage mechanism. In addition, electrolytes are a pivotal part in a battery configuration. The use of additives and optimization of components and ratios can promote the formation of stable SEI layers and thus battery performance.
However, the research on non-aqueous KIBs is in its very incipient stage. There are still many challenges to overcome, including but not limited to: (1) understanding of the storage mechanisms and kinetics of K ions during the intercalation reactions; (2) binder and electrolyte effects on the performance of KIBs have been reported but in-depth investigations are needed to develop compatible and efficient electrolyte and binder systems; (3) K has a lower melting temperature and is more chemically reactive than Li and Na, implying more safety hazards for KIBs. There is still a long winding road ahead to achieve viable performance of non-aqueous KIBs for practical applications.
