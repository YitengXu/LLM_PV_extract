    , Accepted 3rd January 2007First published on 25th January 2007AbstractThe basic physical and chemical principles behind the dye-sensitized nanocrystalline solar cell (DSC: also known as the Grätzel cell after its inventor) are outlined in order to clarify the differences and similarities between the DSC and conventional semiconductor solar cells. The roles of the components of the DSC (wide bandgap oxide, sensitizer dye, redox electrolyte or hole conductor, counter electrode) are examined in order to show how they influence the performance of the system. The routes that can lead to loss of DSC performance are analyzed within a quantitative framework that considers electron transport and interfacial electron transfer processes, and strategies to improve cell performance are discussed. Electron transport and trapping in the mesoporous oxide are discussed, and a novel method to probe the electrochemical potential (quasi Fermi level) of electrons in the DSC is described. The article concludes with an assessment of the prospects for future development of the DSC concept.
Introduction
The history1 of dye-sensitization of wide bandgap semiconductors can be traced as far back as 1873, the date of Hermann Wilhelm Vogel’s accidental discovery that contamination of silver halide photographic emulsion by a green dye† made the film much more sensitive to red light. Only a year later, Sir William de Wiveleslie Abney had already achieved sensitization of photographic emulsion throughout the entire optical solar spectrum, from violet to infrared. A century later, the application of sensitization to photoelectrochemical systems2 was the subject of widespread research, particularly in the sixties and seventies,3,4 when it was established that the sensitization process involved electron (or hole) injection from the excited state of the sensitizer dye rather than energy transfer. However, at this time there seemed little scope for practical application of the effect to solar energy conversion, since the currents generated by sensitization of single crystal electrodes such as zinc oxide are very small because the dye is present only as a monolayer at the surface and light absorption is therefore very weak. However, in 1976 Tsubomura et al.5 demonstrated that larger photocurrents could be obtained by replacing the flat surface of a single crystal of ZnO by a porous microcrystalline layer, thereby increasing the surface area of the semiconductor to enhance light harvesting. Interestingly, it was not this paper in Nature that led to the explosion of interest in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC). Instead, this was stimulated fifteen years later by the much-cited‡Nature paper of O’Regan and Grätzel,6 who showed that an efficient (>7%) regenerative photoelectrochemical solar cell could be fabricated using a mesoporous layer of titanium dioxide sensitized by a strongly absorbed ruthenium dye. Since then, efforts to optimize DSC have resulted in cells with AM 1.5§ efficiencies above 11%,7 and the technology is now approaching the stage where it is poised to compete with more conventional photovoltaics. New developments include the use of templated mesoporous TiO2 layers8,9 and new organic dyes.10–14 At the same time, the understanding of processes occurring on the nanoscale developed by research on DSCs will increasingly be applied to other devices for solar energy conversion, including organic bulk heterojunction solar cells,15–18 hybrid organic/inorganic solar cells19–21 and tandem water splitting systems for solar hydrogen generation.22,23
Fabrication of a typical DSC starts with two sheets of glass coated with a transparent layer of fluorine-doped tin oxide. One plate is coated with a thin layer of colloidal TiO2 paste consisting of particles with sizes in the 20–40 nm range. The film is sintered in air at 400 °C to produce a mesoporous layer (≈10 μm) with a porosity of around 50%, which is then sensitized by adsorption of a dye such as the widely-used cis-bis(isothiocyanato) bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II) bis-tetrabutylammonium24,25 (Fig. 1) or one of the recently introduced organic dyes.14,26,27

The second glass plate is coated with a thin film of platinum by sputtering or by electrochemical deposition. The two plates are sandwiched together with hot melt polymer gasket, and an electrolyte consisting of the iodide/tri-iodide redox couple in a suitable solvent is filled through a small hole drilled in the platinum coated plate, which is then sealed. The steps in the assembly are illustrated in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Fabrication of a dye sensitized mesoporous solar cell. 
Generation of a photocurrent in the DSC occurs when light is absorbed by the sensitizer dye, resulting in ultra-fast electron injection into the conduction band of the TiO2.28–31 The injected electrons move through the network of interconnected oxide particles (typical size 30–40 nm) by a random walk process32 until they reach the conducting glass substrate¶. The oxidized dye is regenerated by rapid electron transfer from the iodide ions in the electrolyte before it has time to undergo irreversible bleaching.33,34 The I3− ions produced in the regeneration step diffuse the short distance (typically <40 μm) to the platinum-coated cathode, where they are reduced to iodide ions to complete the regenerative cycle. The dye regeneration step is analogous to the super-sensitization process that is used in photography to allow dye molecules to inject electrons repeatedly without bleaching. A recent estimate suggests that turnover numbers|| in excess of 108 are feasible in the DSC, giving a lifetime of 20 years or more.7 The timescale on which processes in the DSC occur ranges from sub-picoseconds for electron injection to seconds for diffusion of redox ions between the two plates. The complete regenerative cycle is illustrated schematically in Fig. 3.

Basic principles
Free energy and driving forces
The energetics of the DSC are usually discussed in terms of the relative positions of the energies of the TiO2 conduction band, the HOMO/LUMO energies of the dye and the ‘redox energy’ of the I3−/I− couple, as illustrated in Fig. 4. For successful sensitization, the dye LUMO level must be higher in energy than the conduction band of the TiO2, whereas the redox energy must be higher than the HOMO level to allow regeneration of the dye from its oxidized state.
 Fig. 4  Energy levels in the dye-sensitized solar cell. 
While Fig. 4 is helpful for the purpose of visualizing the processes in the DSC, it is misleading when used to understand the energetics of the cells because it mixes potential energy (e.g. conduction band energy) and free energy (redox energy) scales. A similar problem arises in the description of the photovoltaic cell found in many elementary texts, where the driving force for the separation of electrons and holes is incorrectly identified with the electrostatic potential difference (i.e. potential energy) across the p–n junction. In fact, the free energy of electrons and holes is sensitive not only to changes in their potential energy arising from the electrical potential, but also to their concentration (via the entropic term in the Gibbs energy). The driving force for the movement of charge carriers is the gradient of free energy (which is small in a typical silicon solar cell) and not the gradient of potential energy (which can be large in a p-n junction).
Würfel35 has shown with remarkable clarity that many apparently different types of devices for converting solar energy share at least two common elements—a light absorbing material and membrane-like contacting phases that are selective for either electrons or holes. Absorption of light in the absorber creates electron–hole pairs that have different free energies. This separation of free energies is a measure of the energy available internally in the device. The role of the contacts is to allow as much as possible of this free energy separation to be available at the contacts as a voltage. In a p-i-n solar cell, the p- and n- contacts are selective for holes and electrons, respectively. Selectivity is achieved in the DSC by using different electron and hole conducting phases. The selectivity is not ideal however, since whereas there is a large thermodynamic barrier for hole injection into the TiO2 from the redox electrolyte, electron injection into the I3−/I− electrolyte from the TiO2 is energetically ‘downhill’ and associated with a kinetic barrier that arises from the activation energy required to break the I–I bond in the process.
The driving force for transport of electrons and holes (or any other species such as ions) in any solar cell is the gradient of free energy or electrochemical potential, i. In solid state physics, the electrochemical potential is identified with the Fermi energy, EF. In general, the electrochemical potential i, associated with a species i with charge ziq is defined as (1)where φ is the inner potential, ni is the density of the species and n01 is the density of the appropriate reference state for which the chemical potential takes its standard value μ0i. In general terms, the flux of any charged species is related to the gradient of free energy by the expression (2)where ui is the mobility. The gradient of electrochemical potential can be found from eqn (1): (3)It follows that the flux of species is given by (4)Using the Einstein relation , which relates the diffusion coefficient Di to the mobility, we obtain (5)The first term is familiar as Fick’s first law of diffusion. The second term represents the migration or drift flux. The more general expression given by eqn (2) will be utilized here, since the gradient of electrochemical potential corresponds to the gradient of the Fermi level used in semiconductor physics.
In a conventional silicon solar cell, only small gradients of free energy are required to drive the short circuit currents because the mobilities of holes and electrons in the highly pure material are high (400–1000 cm2 V−1 s−1). In the DSC, the mobile charges are electrons in the TiO2 and either tri-iodide ions in electrolyte-based cells or holes (radical cations) in cells in which the electrolyte has been replaced with an organic hole conductor such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (OMeTAD).36,37 The mobility of free electrons in TiO2 is two orders of magnitude smaller than in pure silicon, and the mobilities of ionic species in the redox electrolyte (or holes in an organic hole conductor) are at least six orders of magnitude smaller. This means that larger gradients of free energy are required to support current densities (typically 15–20 mA cm−2) generated by solar radiation. In addition, substantial free energy differences may be required to drive interfacial electron transfer processes in the DSC. Both electron transport and electron transfer are dissipative processes, leading to efficiency losses.
The role of electrical fields
It is often stated that the ‘built in field’ is essential in a p-n junction solar cell since it is needed to separate photogenerated electrons and holes. The preceding discussion was intended to show that this is incorrect. The driving force for separation is in fact the gradient of free energy or of the quasi-Fermi levels** for electrons and holes. This raises the question whether electrical fields and ‘built in potentials’ are important in the DSC. We begin by considering what happens when an isolated nanocrystalline particle of TiO2 is brought into contact with the redox electrolyte. For the calculations that follow, we assume that the particle has a radius of 20 nm and is doped n-type with oxygen vacancies with a density of 1018 cm−3. The Fermi level in the particle before immersion is close to the conduction band, and in the absence of other sources of charge, the particle is electrically neutral since the densities of conduction and electrons and ionized donor states are equal. Several estimates indicate that the Fermi energy of the I3−/I− couple is located around 1 eV below the conduction band of the TiO2 as shown in Fig. 5. Consequently, electrons will be extracted from the n-doped particle until the Fermi levels are equilibrated. This will leave the particle with a net positive charge associated with the ionized donors in the lattice. If the particle is small, the density of ionized donor states will now exceed that of the electrons by many orders of magnitude, and the particle is fully depleted. The electrical field is readily found by solving Poisson’s equation in spherical coordinates. (6)For a particle with radius R, the solution†† is (7)and the variation of electrical potential leads to a distortion of the energies of the conduction and valence bands illustrated in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Equilibration of Fermi levels between a TiO2 particle and the I3−/I− redox electrolyte in the dark. Note that the band bending induced in the particle is small (<50 meV) unless the doping density is higher than 1018 cm−3. 
In the case where the doping density is 1018 cm−3, there is a ‘band bending’ of 40 meV between the centre of the particle and the surface (it is exaggerated in the figure to make it visible). Note that this is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the initial difference in Fermi levels (around 1 eV). If the doping level is 1017 cm−3, the band bending inside the particle is reduced to only 4 meV.
Since the Fermi energy is the same throughout the particle, the change in electrical potential is offset by a corresponding variation of electron density. This means that at equilibrium in the dark, the ratio of the electron density at the surface of the particle to the density at the centre will be given by (8)For the present case (R = 20 nm, Nd = 1018 cm−3, T = 300 K, the ratio is 0.2, i.e. the surface is weakly depleted relative to the centre. For lower doping densities, the difference becomes insignificant, and the interior of the particle can be treated as field free. Interestingly, the influence of band bending is expected to become important for higher doping densities, when it could lead to electron channelling as illustrated in Fig. 6 for an array of interconnected spherical particles. One can speculate that by keeping photogenerated electrons near the centre of the ‘channels’, losses due to back reaction with I3− could be reduced. The effect should be most marked in the case of highly doped particles or large particles.

Contacting the nanocrystalline oxide
On the basis of this analysis, we may expect an ensemble of interconnected TiO2 particles immersed in the redox electrolyte to be completely depleted (and hence insulating) in the dark. In the DSC, however, the last layer of oxide nanoparticles is in contact with the conducting glass substrate, so we need to consider the nature of this junction. We begin by assuming that the nanocrystalline layer is deposited directly on the fluorine doped tin oxide glass coating (i.e. there is no intermediate or ‘blocking’ layer). Consider an isolated particle of TiO2 that is brought into contact with the SnO2(F). Depending on the relative positions of the Fermi levels in the two materials, equilibration of electrons at the contact may lead to depletion of the TiO2 or of the SnO2. For simplicity, we will assume that the Fermi levels are equal before contact, although this does not change the following argument. The electron affinity of SnO2 is believed to be about 0.3 eV greater than that of TiO2, and this difference has been incorporated in the band diagram shown in Fig. 7. The junction is then brought into contact with the redox electrolyte to form a three phase contact, resulting in a downward movement of the Fermi levels. The situation after contact is illustrated in Fig. 7. It can be seen that band bending in the SnO2(F) is large, whereas by contrast the band bending in the particle is too small to be visible in the figure.
 Fig. 7  Band bending at the contact between the TiO2 layer and the SnO2(F)-coated conducting glass substrate. Note that equilibration of the Fermi levels in the dark induces a depletion layer in the SnO2. 
It is important to note that in the absence of a blocking layer, the underlying SnO2(F) is not only in contact with the nanoparticles but also directly with the redox electrolyte. In these uncoated areas, the SnO2 will also be depleted in the same way. The width of the space charge layer formed in the highly doped (≈1020 cm−3) SnO2(F) coating is given by (9)where Δϕ is the potential difference across the space charge region, ε is the relative permittivity of SnO2 and ε0 is the permittivity of free space. Wsc is therefore only a few nm, so that electrons will be able to tunnel readily across the barrier. This means that as far as electrochemical processes are concerned, the SnO2(F) layer behaves like a metal electrode. We can conclude that there is indeed a ‘built in potential’. However, it is not located in the mesoporous film but at the substrate interface. Consequently, electron transport in the bulk of the mesoporous film is expected to occur by diffusion.
Open circuit voltage of the DSC
We begin by considering the situation where the DSC is illuminated at open circuit. Under these conditions, injection of electrons from photoexcited dye molecules must be balanced by the sum of all routes for electron transfer in the opposite direction. Three such routes can be identified. The first is transfer of electrons from the mesoporous TiO2 layer to I3− ions in the electrolyte‡‡. The second is transfer of electrons from the mesoporous oxide to oxidised dye molecules attached to the surface, and the third is electron transfer to I3− ions via the SnO2(F) contact. The rate of electron injection is determined by the light intensity and the surface coverage of adsorbed dye. Light scattering can be neglected if the TiO2 particles are sufficiently small, and the local rate of electron injection υinj(λ, x) can be calculated using the expression for an isotropic non-scattering optical medium (10)where ηinj is the efficiency of electron injection from the excited state of the dye. The absorption coefficient, α, is related to the effective molar concentration c and molar absorption coefficient ε(λ) of the dye (11)The rate of reverse electron transfer from the nanocrystalline TiO2 to the oxidized dye is determined by competition between the reaction (12a)and the regeneration step (12b)Under steady state conditions, the rate of electron transfer to D+ is given by (13)The concentration of iodide ions in the DSC is usually sufficiently high (>1020 cm−3) that reaction (12a) can be neglected to a first approximation.
The rate of electron transfer to I3− ions is the dominant quantity that determines the open circuit voltage at high intensities of the order of 1 sun. In the absence of dissociative chemisorption of iodine, the first step in the reduction (14a)can be followed either by a second electron transfer step (14b)or by the reaction (14c)If the step (14a) is rate-determining, the expression for the rate of ‘recombination’§§ takes the form (15)This rate expression will also be valid if the mechanism involves dissociation of I2 prior to electron transfer,38 with the rate constant incorporating the equilibrium constant for dissociation.
The third route by which electrons can react involves transfer from the SnO2(F) substrate to I3−. We can treat this as an electrochemical process using Butler Volmer kinetics.39 The driving force for the reaction comes from the overpotential—the difference between the potential of an electrode and its equilibrium (Nernstian) potential. In the open circuit case, the potential of the SnO2(F) electrode is changed under illumination by an amount corresponding to the open circuit voltage. In the dark, the electrode potential is equal to the equilibrium potential of the I3−/I− couple, so the magnitude of the overvoltage under illumination is equal to the photovoltage. The current density associated with reaction (14) can therefore be written as40,41 (16)(note that a reduction current is taken to have a negative sign, whereas the photovoltage is taken as a positive quantity). Here j0sub is the exchange current density, which depends on the standard rate constant for electron transfer k0 and the concentrations of the redox components.39 The key point here is that additional current flows internally via the substrate, even though the cell is at open circuit.
The open circuit condition can now be defined in terms of the injection rate and the recombination rates for all three routes using the equivalence (17)where d is the thickness of the film.
In order to simplify the treatment at this point, we assume that electron transfer to D+ and electron transfer via the substrate can both be neglected. For homogeneous illumination, the injection rate is constant over the film and the steady state electron density is given by (18)where τn is the electron lifetime. It can be seen that this simple approach predicts that the steady state electron density is linearly proportional to the illumination intensity and to the electron lifetime. Clearly, one way to increase the open circuit voltage is to decrease the concentration of I3−. However, this will impose restrictions on the maximum (diffusion limited) current that the cell can deliver. The alternative is to reduce the rate constant for electron transfer by modification of the surface of the TiO2 particles with blocking layers.42,43
If the electrons in the TiO2 are free to move in the conduction band, the photovoltage can be related to the electron quasi Fermi level (or electrochemical potential) via the Fermi Dirac function (19)In the limit that E

					EF is much greater than kBT, eqn (19) reduces to the Boltzmann limit. The density of electrons in the conduction band is determined by the product of the density of states function Nc and the occupation probability, so that (20)In the dark, the Fermi level in the TiO2 is equal to the redox Fermi level, EF,redox and the (very low) electron density is (20b)As illustrated in Fig. 8, the photovoltage is given by (21)Eqn (21) shows that in order to produce a (typical) open circuit voltage of 0.77 V at 1 sun, the ratio nc/n0c must be 1013. Since for Ec

					EF,redox = 1 eV and Nc = 1021 cm−3, the density of electrons in the dark is 104 cm−3, a photovoltage of 0.77 V corresponds to a free electron density of 1017 cm−3. The rate of optical excitation at 1 sun is of the order of 1017/d cm−3 = 1020 cm−3 (typically d, the film thickness, = 10 μm). Eqn (18) shows that in order to achieve high photovoltages, the electron lifetime should be as high as possible.
 Fig. 8  Energy diagram illustrating relationship between the terms in the expression for the photovoltage (eqn (21)). 
The IV characteristic
In order to obtain the complete IV characteristic of the DSC, we need to consider electron injection, electron transfer and electron transport. Here we make several simplifying approximations. Firstly, we neglect losses via electron transfer to D+ and to I3−via the substrate. Secondly, we neglect light scattering and treat the porous nanocrystalline electrode as optically homogeneous. Thirdly, we assume that electron transport is controlled entirely by diffusion since electrical fields normal to the substrate are negligible. Fourthly, we neglect the variations of I3− concentration arising from the diffusion gradients set up under operating conditions. This last assumption allows us to consider the electron lifetime τn as independent of distance. Under steady state conditions, the generation, collection and transport of electrons is described by the continuity equation (22)The boundary conditions required for solution of this equation are (23a) (23b)The current density is given by (24)As shown by Södergren et al.,44 the solution of the continuity equation can be written in a form that resembles the diode equation describing a conventional p–n photodiode. (25a)The first term in eqn (25a) corresponds to the light-generated current. It is determined simply by the amount of light absorbed and by the injection efficiency. The second term represents the dark current of the device associated with electron transfer from the TiO2 to I3−. In eqn (25a), Ln is the diffusion length of electrons in the TiO2, which is defined as (25b)In the limit exp(qUphoto/kBT) and for strong light absorption (e−ad
					≪ 1), the open circuit voltage follows from the condition j = 0 (26)This result is identical with the conclusion reached in the previous section.
By analogy with the conventional solid state diode, we can define the reverse saturation current density as (27)so that the photovoltage is related to jsat by (28)Eqn (28) illustrates the importance of minimising the reverse saturation current in order to enhance cell performance. It also predicts that the photovoltage should vary with illumination intensity with a slope of 59 mV per decade at 300 K (ideal diode behaviour). Fig. 9 shows that an optimized DSC does indeed behave almost as predicted by eqn (28)¶¶.
 Fig. 9  Intensity dependence of the photovoltage for a DSC with a blocking layer to prevent shunting via the SnO2(F) substrate. The almost ideal slope indicates that the transfer of electrons to I3− occurs predominantly via the conduction band of the mesoporous TiO2. 
Solution of the continuity equation as a function of voltage U between U = 0 and U = Uphoto gives the complete IV characteristic as illustrated in Fig. 10 for two different values of the electron lifetime.

The electron quasi Fermi level in the DSC
Solution of the continuity equation also gives the profiles of electron density under operating conditions. Fig. 11a illustrates the profile of electron concentration under short circuit conditions calculated for monochromatic illumination corresponding approximately to 1 sun. The corresponding variation of the electron quasi Fermi level, nEF, is shown in Fig. 11b. The result is interesting because the difference in nEF between x = 0 and x = d is predicted to be of the order of 0.5 eV. Fig. 11b also shows the driving force corresponding to the gradient of nEF. It is high near the contact because the concentration of electrons is low.

By contrast with the situation at short circuit, the electron density (and hence electron quasi Fermi level under open circuit conditions) is almost constant across the entire film, and the difference nEF

					EF,redox determines the photovoltage measured at the contacts. The continuity equation can be solved for voltages between U = 0 and U > Uphoto, and the results are shown in Fig. 12, which shows how the value of nEF at x = d (other side of the film) varies along the IV characteristic.

Note that the QFL remains constant over a voltage range of 0.5 V from short circuit, before rising as electron accumulation begins at more negative voltages. Values used in the calculation. I0 = 1017 cm−2 s−1, τn = 5 × 10−5 s, Dn = 0.5 cm2 s−1. d = 5 μm, α = 1000 cm−1. 
The predictions of the model presented here have been tested recently using a DSC in which an evaporated titanium electrode is used to sense the quasi Fermi level at x = d.45 The titanium electrode is passivated by air oxidation to ensure that it does not provide a shunt path for electrons in the TiO2. The cell design is illustrated in Fig. 13 together with the experimentally measured variation of the quasi Fermi level at x = d. It can be seen that the experiment results agree with Fig. 12.
 Fig. 13  Experimental variation of the electron QFL at x = d measured using a titanium indicator electrode evaporated on the top of the mesoporous TiO2 layer. Compare with Fig. 12. The construction of the cell with a titanium top electrode is illustrated on the right (see ref. 35 for details). 
If the electron lifetime is short, electrons will be lost during transit to the contact. This problem is particularly acute when the I3−/I− redox system is replaced by one-electron redox systems46 or by hole conducting organic materials such as spiro(MeOTAD).36,47,48 The effect on the profile of electrons under short circuit conditions for illumination from the substrate side is shown in Fig. 14a. If the gradient of electron density in the bulk of the film becomes negative, electrons diffuse away from the contact to be lost by electron transfer to the redox species. If this occurs, only the region of the film adjacent to the contact is active in generating photocurrent.
 Fig. 14  Profiles of electron density under short circuit conditions showing the effect of reducing the free electron lifetime. (a) Dependence of the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) on the ratio of the electron diffusion length Ln to the film thickness, d. Note that for Ln/d > 3 the IPCE approaches its limiting value, which is determined by the fraction of incident light absorbed by the film (in this case 45%). Values used in calculation. α = 1000 cm−1, d = 10 μm, Dn = 0.5 cm2 s−1. 
A useful figure of merit in this context is the electron diffusion length. The fraction of injected electrons that will be collected from 10 μm TiO2 film depends on the electron diffusion length as shown in Fig. 14b. It is evident that optimum performance is obtained when the electron diffusion length is several times greater than the film thickness.
Voltage losses in the DSC
In an operating DSC, it is necessary to consider several loss mechanisms apart from those mentioned above. The IV characteristics will not be described by eqn (25a) because the transfer of electrons to I3− at the cathode requires a finite driving voltage (‘overpotential’). The current density at the cathode is described by the Butler Volmer equation39 which can be written as (29)Here k0 is the standard rate constant for the electron transfer reaction, nσR and nσO are the densities of I− and I3− at the cathode surface, respectively, z is the number of electrons transferred and α is the cathodic transfer coefficient. The upper limit of the cell current at high light intensities (generally >1 sun) is determined by diffusion of I3− to the cathode under conditions where the I3− is completely depleted at the cathode surface. (30)The current density at lower light intensities will be determined by electron transfer and diffusion (mixed control), and the current voltage relationship becomes (31)where η is the overpotential, i.e. the difference between the electrode potential and its equilibrium (Nernstian) value.

Fig. 15 shows how the overvoltage at the cathode varies with current density for typical values of the rate constant and concentrations. At a current density of 15 mA cm−2, the losses will be a only a few tens of millivolts if a platinum coated cathode is used. However, less active cathode materials with lower values of the electron transfer rate constant k0 will give large voltage losses||||.
 Fig. 15  Plots showing how the voltage loss at the cathode in a DSC depends on current density and on k0, the rate constant for the electron transfer process. In the limit that k0 is greater than 0.1 cm s−1, as one would expect for a highly active cathode material, the voltage loss is determined entirely by diffusion (‘diffusion overvoltage’). Lower values of k0 lead to larger voltage losses arising from the ‘kinetic overpotential’. 
The voltage loss associated with driving the reduction of I3− at the cathode will be seen on the IV characteristic as degradation of the fill factor, which is defined as the maximum power output divided by the product of the short circuit current and open circuit voltage. (32)The open circuit voltage is not affected, since no current flows at Voc and therefore the voltage loss at the cathode is zero. Fig. 16 shows how the cathode voltage loss affects the IV characteristic.
 Fig. 16  Calculated IV plots showing the influence of sluggish electron transfer kinetics at the DSC cathode. Note that the short circuit current and open circuit voltage are unaffected by low values of k0, but the fill factor is adversely affected, as can be seen from the difference between the power plots for fast (broken line) and slow (solid line) electron transfer. 
So far we have neglected the losses associated with electron transfer at the substrate (cf. eqn (17)). This ‘shunting’ mechanism is particularly important for cells in which the I3−/I− redox couple is replaced with a one electron transfer couple such as Co(III)/Co(II)(dbbip)(2) (dbbip = 2,6-bis(1′-butylbenzimidazol-2′-yl) pyridine)49,50 or in cells with an organic hole conductor such as spiro(MeOTAD).36,48 At high intensities (1 sun), substrate shunting is less important for cells using the I3−/I− redox system.40 For cells using alternative electrolytes or organic hole conductors, a thin (≅50 nm) blocking layer of compact TiO2 is necessary to prevent severe degradation of cell performance by shunting. The characteristics of the blocking layer can be examined using thin layer cells without the mesoporous TiO2 layer.51Fig. 17 illustrates how effective the blocking layer can be in reducing losses due to electron transfer from the substrate. Electron transfer via the substrate can also be identified by measuring the open circuit photovoltage decay. Cells with good blocking layers to suppress the back reaction exhibit remarkably slow photovoltage decays over a period of up to one hour.52
 Fig. 17  IV plots showing the influence of shunting via the SnO2(F) substrate. Even for a relatively low value of the electron transfer rate constant (k0 = 10−7 cm s−1), the loss of open circuit voltage and maximum power output can be significant. 
Electron transport and trapping in the DSC
The preceding discussion has focussed on the steady state behaviour of the DSC. The responses of the cell voltage and current to changes in light intensity reveal that electrons are trapped at states located in the bandgap of the oxide as shown in the upper part of Fig. 18. Electron transport to the contact involves multiple trapping events as illustrated in the lower part of Fig. 18. This process can be modelled as a random walk on a lattice with a distribution of waiting times53 or as trapping and thermal release of electrons from states distributed in energy.54–57 The process has also been modelled using Monte Carlo methods in order to examine the effect of morphology on electron percolation.58,59
 Fig. 18  Electron trap states in the TiO2 appear to be distributed exponentially in energy as shown in the upper part of the figure. Here Nt(E) is the density of states of the traps. Electron transport in the TiO2 particles involves multiple trapping events as shown in the lower part of the figure. The dynamic response of the DSC is strongly influenced by trapping/detrapping of electrons. 
In general, the density of electrons in the conduction band is many orders of magnitude lower than the density of trapped electrons. Although electron transport and electron transfer involve conduction band electrons, dynamic measurements of photocurrent and photovoltage are strongly influenced by trapping/detrapping since the trap occupation responds to changes in the density of electrons in the conduction band. This means, for example, that the true electron lifetime is not accessible from transient photovoltage measurements. Similarly, the true diffusion coefficient of electrons cannot be derived directly from transient photocurrent measurements. This has important implications for attempts to determine these quantities as part of a strategy for cell optimization. Methods used to determine the relaxation times associated with recombination and transport in DSCs include small amplitude transient60–63 and periodic64–67 methods.
In order to treat the non steady state situation, the continuity equation (eqn (22)) must be modified to include terms to account for trapping and detrapping of electrons. A very clear treatment of this problem has been given by Bisquert and Vikhrenko,68 who have shown that the apparent values of the electron diffusion coefficient, Dn, and electron lifetime, τn, are related to the true (conduction band) values D0 and τ0 by (33)It follows that (34)The and  terms in eqn (33) can be found by noting that (35)Here g(E) is the density of states distribution from the electron traps*** (methods that provide information about trap distributions include photovoltage decay52,69 and charge extraction52,70).
An important consequence of the relationships above is that Dn and τn depend on trap occupancy and therefore on illumination intensity, but their product does not, so that Ln remains constant and is accessible to measurement via determination of Dn and τn. This means that determination of Ln is possible in principle, even if D0 and τ0 are not accessible individually. For an exponential distribution of traps, Dn and τn vary with intensity according to a power law with opposite sign as illustrated in Fig. 19 for the case of a spiro-MeOTAD cell.37 In this case, the experimentally determined diffusion length varies by less than 30% over the entire range of intensity.
 Fig. 19  Intensity dependence of the apparent values of the electron diffusion coefficient and electron lifetime measured for a MeOTAD cell (data from ref. 28). The intensity dependence arises from the influence of electron trapping/detrapping on the dynamic photocurrent and photovoltage responses. The figure also shows the calculated electron diffusion length, which varies only weakly with light intensity as predicted theoretically by the multiple trapping model. 
Conclusions and outlook
Development of new types of dye-sensitized solar cells and the optimization of existing types involves consideration of all electron transport and electron transfer processes, not just those taking place in the mesoporous layer. The modelling of cell characteristics using the continuity equation provides a useful starting point for understanding the factors that control the efficiency of charge collection and voltage generation. Key parameters that control device performance include band edge positions, electron diffusion coefficients and rate constants for interfacial electron transfer. More work is required to understand how to control these parameters, for example by self-assembly and surface modification. The influence of trapping/detrapping on the DSC response remains a controversial question, with several recent papers claiming that the multiple trapping model may not be correct,71,72 and other supporting it.73,74 In any case, the identity of the trapping states remains unclear as does the existence and possible role of surface states.
The future development of this exciting field will need to combine novel approaches to materials design with appropriate modelling of the various cell components. Key challenges include demonstration of device stability and scale-up of fabrication. It seems unlikely that an acceptable lifetime will be achievable using liquid redox mediators, and more work is needed to identify and optimize alternative ‘hole conducting’ media that are cheap and stable. Even leaving aside the still open question of its eventual commercial exploitation, the DSC is likely to remain a powerful stimulus for new materials chemistry and theoretical modelling.

Footnotes† The green dye was applied to the back of photographic plates to reduce reflection.‡ Over 2700 citations at the time this review was written.§ AM 1.5 (air mass 1.5) refers to standard solar irradiance at the surface of the earth at an angle of incidence of 48° relative to the surface normal.¶ The electrons undergo multiple trapping as they move to the contact. This is discussed later.|| In a DSC under 1 sun illumination, each dye molecule absorbs photons at a rate of about 1 per second, corresponding to 3.2 × 107 turnovers per year.** The term quasi Fermi level is used in solid state physics to describe systems in which electrons and holes are in thermal equilibrium with the lattice but not with each other. This is the situation under steady illumination, where a photostationary state is produced.†† The arbitrary zero of potential has been taken as in vacuum at infinity.‡‡ This electron transfer can occur either directly from the conduction band or via surface states in the bandgap. The analysis of the latter case is complex and outside the scope of this review.§§ The term ‘recombination’ usually refers to electron–hole recombination in semiconductors. Here the term is used to include the transfer of electrons to oxidized molecular species (D+ and I3−).¶¶ Non-ideal diode behaviour is frequently reported for DSCs. Possible reasons for non-ideality include shunting via the substrate and electron transfer via surface states.|||| Platinum is an electrocatalyst for the iodide/tri-iodide redox couple. Iodine is dissociatively chemisorbed on platinum, overcoming the high activation energy associated with breaking the I–I bond. The DSC therefore relies on electron transfer to I3− being very fast at platinum but very slow at the mesoporous TiO2. In the absence of this ‘kinetic asymmetry’, the cell does not work.*** Experimentally determined trap distributions in TiO2 commonly follow an exponential energy distribution, with the number of traps tailing off as the energy moves down into the bandgap.This journal is © the Owner Societies 2007

 	Fig. 13  Experimental variation of the electron QFL at x = d measured using a titanium indicator electrode evaporated on the top of the mesoporous TiO2 layer. Compare with Fig. 12. The construction of the cell with a titanium top electrode is illustrated on the right (see ref. 35 for details).	 

 	Fig. 14  Profiles of electron density under short circuit conditions showing the effect of reducing the free electron lifetime. (a) Dependence of the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) on the ratio of the electron diffusion length Ln to the film thickness, d. Note that for Ln/d > 3 the IPCE approaches its limiting value, which is determined by the fraction of incident light absorbed by the film (in this case 45%). Values used in calculation. α = 1000 cm−1, d = 10 μm, Dn = 0.5 cm2 s−1.

 	Fig. 15  Plots showing how the voltage loss at the cathode in a DSC depends on current density and on k0, the rate constant for the electron transfer process. In the limit that k0 is greater than 0.1 cm s−1, as one would expect for a highly active cathode material, the voltage loss is determined entirely by diffusion (‘diffusion overvoltage’). Lower values of k0 lead to larger voltage losses arising from the ‘kinetic overpotential’.

 	Fig. 16  Calculated IV plots showing the influence of sluggish electron transfer kinetics at the DSC cathode. Note that the short circuit current and open circuit voltage are unaffected by low values of k0, but the fill factor is adversely affected, as can be seen from the difference between the power plots for fast (broken line) and slow (solid line) electron transfer.	 

 	Fig. 17  IV plots showing the influence of shunting via the SnO2(F) substrate. Even for a relatively low value of the electron transfer rate constant (k0 = 10−7 cm s−1), the loss of open circuit voltage and maximum power output can be significant.	 

 	Fig. 18  Electron trap states in the TiO2 appear to be distributed exponentially in energy as shown in the upper part of the figure. Here Nt(E) is the density of states of the traps. Electron transport in the TiO2 particles involves multiple trapping events as shown in the lower part of the figure. The dynamic response of the DSC is strongly influenced by trapping/detrapping of electrons.

 	Fig. 19  Intensity dependence of the apparent values of the electron diffusion coefficient and electron lifetime measured for a MeOTAD cell (data from ref. 28). The intensity dependence arises from the influence of electron trapping/detrapping on the dynamic photocurrent and photovoltage responses. The figure also shows the calculated electron diffusion length, which varies only weakly with light intensity as predicted theoretically by the multiple trapping model.

Footnotes
† The green dye was applied to the back of photographic plates to reduce reflection.
‡ Over 2700 citations at the time this review was written.
§ AM 1.5 (air mass 1.5) refers to standard solar irradiance at the surface of the earth at an angle of incidence of 48° relative to the surface normal.
¶ The electrons undergo multiple trapping as they move to the contact. This is discussed later.
|| In a DSC under 1 sun illumination, each dye molecule absorbs photons at a rate of about 1 per second, corresponding to 3.2 × 107 turnovers per year.
** The term quasi Fermi level is used in solid state physics to describe systems in which electrons and holes are in thermal equilibrium with the lattice but not with each other. This is the situation under steady illumination, where a photostationary state is produced.
†† The arbitrary zero of potential has been taken as in vacuum at infinity.
‡‡ This electron transfer can occur either directly from the conduction band or via surface states in the bandgap. The analysis of the latter case is complex and outside the scope of this review.
§§ The term ‘recombination’ usually refers to electron–hole recombination in semiconductors. Here the term is used to include the transfer of electrons to oxidized molecular species (D+ and I3−).
¶¶ Non-ideal diode behaviour is frequently reported for DSCs. Possible reasons for non-ideality include shunting via the substrate and electron transfer via surface states.
|||| Platinum is an electrocatalyst for the iodide/tri-iodide redox couple. Iodine is dissociatively chemisorbed on platinum, overcoming the high activation energy associated with breaking the I–I bond. The DSC therefore relies on electron transfer to I3− being very fast at platinum but very slow at the mesoporous TiO2. In the absence of this ‘kinetic asymmetry’, the cell does not work.
*** Experimentally determined trap distributions in TiO2 commonly follow an exponential energy distribution, with the number of traps tailing off as the energy moves down into the bandgap.
