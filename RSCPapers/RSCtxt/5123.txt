When the morphology and surface coverage of the Pb(NO3)2 film was controlled during coating, a power conversion efficiency of 12.58% under standard conditions (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2) was achieved for the PSC.
Inorganic–organic lead halide perovskite crystals possess a superior light absorption capability1 and tuneable bandgap,2 which render them promising for use in organic semiconductors,3 photo-detectors,4 and photovoltaics.1,5 The goal of using methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI3) as a light harvester for organic photovoltaics began in 2009, when Miyasaka et al. fabricated the first MAPbX3 (X = Br or I)-sensitized solar cells by using a liquid electrolyte.1 However, liquid electrolytes are corrosive against perovskite crystals and were replaced by solid-state hole conductors which improve power conversion efficiency (PCE) and device stability.5 To date, a certified PCE of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exceeding 20% has been achieved.
One of the advantages of PSCs is that although their architecture is versatile, they can be fabricated using cost-effective and scalable solution processes.5–10 In general, MAPbI3 crystals, the product of a lead-containing precursor and methylammonium iodide (MAI), are formed via one-step6,11 or sequential deposition,12–14 depending on whether the lead source and MAI are deposited onto the substrate once or sequentially. MAPbI3 is the most explored perovskite material, and various lead-containing precursors such as lead iodide (PbI2),12,13,15 lead chloride,6,16 lead acetate,17,18 hydroiodized lead iodide,19 lead acetylacetone,18 and lead thiocyanate20 have also been studied. PbI2 is the basic material used in preparing MAPbI3, because it contains lead as well as iodide. Although the photovoltaic performance yielded by different lead precursors varies, almost all studies have used high polarity, aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF) because of their solubility.
Concerns regarding the toxicity of PSCs have been addressed recently;21 organo-lead compounds are severely harmful to the human body and the environment. Therefore, research on creating lead-free PSCs is intensive.22–25 While most of the debates address on the hazard of organo-lead in perovskite crystals, in this paper, we address concerns regarding the processing solvent used during perovskite deposition. Compared with lead perovskite, the pathology of which is uncertain, DMF is a toxicant and has been linked to liver disease clinically.26,27 Herein, we report our first attempt to fabricate highly efficient PSCs using a water-based lead-precursor and lead nitrate (Pb(NO3)2), via sequential deposition.12 The Pb(NO3)2 was combined with water, and the surface morphology and formation of the perovskite structure were carefully scrutinised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The Pb(NO3)2/water system is an alternative system that can be used in PSCs without the need for toxic solvents. During current optimisation, a PCE of 12.58% was achieved under standard test conditions (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2).

Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the device architecture and the process for fabricating perovskite layers in the Pb(NO3)2/water system. The device architecture (Fig. 1a) features a bilayer structure comprising a blocking (BL) TiO2 layer and a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold, which benefits charge collection and hysteresis minimisation.11,28 The perovskite layer was prepared using sequential deposition, primarily according to the process described in a published report;12 however, the PbI2/DMF precursor solution was replaced by an aqueous Pb(NO3)2 solution. The process we used (Fig. 1b) involves additional UV-ozone pre-treatment of the mesoporous TiO2-containing substrate before Pb(NO3)2 spin-coating to enhance wettability between the mesoporous TiO2 and hydrophilic Pb(NO3)2. Fig. 1c shows an XRD analysis of the resulting perovskite film. The conversion of Pb(NO3)2 to MAPbI3 by using DMF as the processing solvent has been confirmed in previous studies;18,28,29 our results further reveal that perovskite crystals can be formed in an aqueous Pb(NO3)2 solution. According to Fig. 1c, diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.2°, 28.5°, and 31.9° correspond to the (110), (220), and (312) lattice planes of the perovskite, respectively. The diffraction peak at 12.7°, which is commonly found in a PbI2/DMF system and represents the incomplete conversion of PbI2 to MAPbI3, becomes extremely weak in the Pb(NO3)2/water system, indicating the inherent advantage of a higher conversion of lead precursor and a purer perovskite crystal in the Pb(NO3)2/water system. Another feature apparent from the XRD results for the Pb(NO3)2/water system is that the peak intensity at 31.9° is relatively higher than that in the PbI2/DMF system. This higher intensity may be attributed to the preferred orientation of crystal growth, which was altered in the Pb(NO3)2/water system. However, how it affects the photovoltaic property of perovskite crystals remains unknown and warrants investigation.

(a) Device architecture of PSC (FTO/TiO2 blocking layer/mesoporous TiO2–MAPbI3 composite layer/MAPbI3 capping layer/spiro-OMeTAD/Au). (b) Procedure for preparing a MAPbI3 layer in the Pb(NO3)2/water system. (c) XRD pattern of MAPbI3 coated on the FTO/blocking-TiO2/mesoporous-TiO2 substrate in the PbI2/DMF and Pb(NO3)2/water system. The PbI2 crystal was indexed as (001) at 2θ = 12.7° and the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal was indexed as (110), (220), and (312) at 2θ = 14.2°, 28.5°, and 31.9°, respectively. 
Notably, during the preparation of the perovskite layer in a Pb(NO3)2/water system, care must be taken in the spin-coating step. The morphology of Pb(NO3)2 strongly depends on the wettability between the hydrophilic Pb(NO3)2 and the TiO2 scaffold. Fig. 2 shows the SEM topographies of the samples after aqueous Pb(NO3)2 was spin-coated onto the TiO2 scaffold. Without treatment of the surface before spin-coating, the resultant film has an extremely coarse, uneven morphology. As is apparent from Fig. 2a, large grains with radial lines were observed on the mesoporous TiO2 surface, indicating that most of the precursor solution was dispersed by centrifugal force during spinning. This pattern is generally regarded as the result of poor wettability between the film and the substrate. Thus, we applied a pre-treatment by exposing the TiO2 scaffold-containing substrate to UV-ozone irradiation before spin-coating. The purpose of this treatment is to hydrophilize the surface, thereby improving the wettability before spinning. The change in the hydrophilicity of the TiO2 substrate was investigated by measuring the water contact angle of the TiO2 scaffold-containing substrate. According to the inset of Fig. 2a and b, the water contact angle decreased from 22.2° to 3.7° after UV-ozone treatment for 10 minutes. Because of the super hydrophilic surface, the morphology of the resultant Pb(NO3)2 changed dramatically. Fig. 2c is the zoom-in image of the central area in Fig. 2b. It can be seen in Fig. 2c that an islandish film predominated the morphology of the Pb(NO3)2 (Fig. 2b).

(c) High magnification of (b). The inset shows the contact angle between the Pb(NO3)2 droplet and the mesoporous-TiO2 layer. 
Although large areas bare of TiO2 remained, the Pb(NO3)2 was thoroughly distributed over an extensive area, and we thus presumed that infiltration to the inner porous structure of the TiO2 scaffold was attributable to favourable wettability.
As noted previously, the XRD patterns of MAPbI3 fabricated using an aqueous Pb(NO3)2 precursor revealed no PbI2 residue, a phenomenon that prompted us to investigate the formation mechanism of such MAPbI3. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), according to the UV-vis spectra of the Pb(NO3)2-coated substrate dipped into an MAI solution for different durations, the conversion of MAPbI3 from the Pb(NO3)2/water system required at least 200 seconds. Compared with the formation of MAPbI3 in the PbI2/DMF system, which reportedly requires only a few seconds for conversion from PbI2,13 the formation of MAPbI3 in our Pb(NO3)2/water system is much slower. To investigate the formation of MAPbI3, the time-trajectory XRD pattern and corresponding SEM topography were monitored on the spin-coated Pb(NO3)2 film according to different MAI incubation times; Fig. 3 shows a summary of the results. According to Fig. 3a, before MAI incubation, diffraction peaks of pristine Pb(NO3)2 were found at 2θ = 19.6° and 22.7°. After a fluoride-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2/Pb(NO3)2 substrate was immersed in an MAI solution for 100 seconds (red line), the XRD features of the Pb(NO3)2 vanished and a new signal at 2θ = 12.7° indicated PbI2 formation. When the incubation time increased, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 12.7° gradually decreased and a new diffraction peak at 2θ = 14.2° gradually increased, indicating the formation of the MAPbI3 phase.

(a) XRD spectra of FTO/blocking-TiO2/mesoporous TiO2–Pb(NO3)2 substrates immersed in MAI solution for sequential durations. (b) SEM topographies of the FTO/blocking TiO2/mesoporous TiO2–Pb(NO3)2 substrate immersed in MAI solution for sequential durations. (c) Correlation between perovskite conversion and MAI incubation time in the Pb(NO3)2/water system. The blue dot represents the conversion of perovskite in the PbI2/DMF system; MAI incubation duration was fixed at 100 seconds. 
On the basis of XRD observation, we propose that the formation of MAPbI3 from Pb(NO3)2 involves a two-step reaction: Pb(NO3)2 + 2MAI → PbI2 + 2MANO3(1) PbI2 + MAI → MAPbI3(2) The first step is the formation of PbI2, during which time Pb(NO3)2 is exposed to the MAI solution (reaction (1)). Indicated as a red line in Fig. 3a, this reaction was rapidly completed within 100 seconds, and the characteristic peaks of pristine Pb(NO3)2 disappeared entirely, leaving only the characteristic peaks of PbI2. Interestingly, no characteristic peaks representing MAPbI3 are apparent on the red line, indicating that MAPbI3 cannot be formed directly from Pb(NO3)2. In contrast to reaction (1), reaction (2), the transformation of PbI2 to MAPbI3, is much slower. Compared with reaction (1), which occurs within 100 seconds, reaction (2) requires approximately 700 seconds to entirely consume the PbI2 formed from reaction (1). Compared with that in a conventional PbI2/DMF system, the propagation and crystal growth of MAPbI3 can be completed within few seconds.13 Our results suggest that reaction (1) plays an important role in the kinetics of reaction (2), and the consumption of MAI in reaction (1) may account for this; however, such consumption requires further investigation.
Despite the slow rate of MAPbI3 formation in the Pb(NO3)2/water system, the XRD results revealed a noticeable feature that may benefit the photovoltaic property: the amount of unconverted PbI2 was minimised. To qualitatively express the conversion of MAPbI3, we define the conversion of MAPbI3 (CMAPbI3) in reaction (2) as  where I is the intensity of the defined diffraction peak in Fig. 3a. The correlation between CMAPbI3 and the MAI incubation time is showed in Fig. 3b. When the MAI incubation time increased, CMAPbI3 increased to 69.7% until 500 seconds, approximately the same percentage as that when MAPbI3 was fabricated using the PbI2/DMF system and 100 seconds of MAI incubation (blue dot, Fig. 3c). As mentioned previously and in published reports,30 the conversion of MAPbI3 by using the PbI2/DMF system is not complete because of an inevitable pristine PbI2 residue. Interestingly, in the Pb(NO3)2/water system, the CMAPbI3 increased consistently and reached a plateau higher than 90% after 700 seconds of MAI incubation. To obtain deeper insight into MAPbI3 crystal growth, the topographies of the XRD curves in Fig. 3a were scrutinised using SEM; Fig. 3c provides a summary. In the figure, the surface coverage of TiO2 is imperfect owing to the islandish deposition of Pb(NO3)2 mentioned previously. A careful inspection of these images reveals that different crystal appearances during particular MAI incubation periods can be identified: sheet-like crystals in the early stage (100 seconds), various shapes of crystals containing irregular grains and thin rods in the intermediate stage (300–500 seconds), and thick rods and cuboid crystals in the final stage (after 700 seconds). According to XRD analysis, the formation of MAPbI3 from Pb(NO3)2 can be classified into three stages: PbI2, MAPbI3-rich, and MAPbI3-dominated phases. Integrating the information obtained from the XRD and SEM analyses, we speculate that the mechanism is as follows: first, the Pb(NO3)2 reacts with MAI rapidly in an MAI solution and forms sheet-like PbI2 crystals through ion displacement. Second, preferential nucleation of the MAPbI3 at a particular facet results in lateral growth of crystals, changing the characteristic XRD pattern. Zoom-in images at 100 seconds and 200 seconds of the MAI incubation samples are provided in Fig. S2 (ESI†), in which dramatic changes in crystal shapes, from sheet-like to irregular shapes, are apparent, verifying our speculation. Further crystal growth and an increase in volume during MAPbI3 formation forces PbI2/MAPbI3 cocktails to merge, causing the irregular shape in the MAPbI3-rich stage. Finally, large MAPbI3 crystals tend to form cuboids or thick rods because of the long incubation duration.31,32

Fig. 4 shows the photovoltaic performance of PSCs fabricated using Pb(NO3)2/water and PbI2/DMF precursor systems and the corresponding top-view images of MAPbI3-capped devices. In Fig. 4a, the current–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimally performing devices and their photovoltaic parameters are depicted in the table in the inset. The curves plotted in Fig. 4a are the averaged results of two scans from both sides. (Two individual scans of both devices are shown in Fig. S3.) According to Fig. 4a, for the Pb(NO3)2/water system, the short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) values derived from the J–V curve are 21.81 mA cm−2, 0.94 V, and 0.61 respectively, causing a PCE of 12.58% under one sun illumination. By comparison, we find that the PbI2/DMF system yields a PCE of 14.38%, with a JSC of 21.99 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.04 V and an FF of 0.63. Although the PCE deviates by 1.8% when the aqueous Pb(NO3)2 precursor is used, Fig. 4a indicates that the JSC of the two devices is almost the same, revealing that the quality of the MAPbI3 is nearly identical; the major difference in photovoltaic parameters of these two devices (VOC and FF) is attributable to the morphology of the MAPbI3 cap. As shown in Fig. 4b, the MAPbI3 crystals appear as a capping layer that fully covers the TiO2 scaffold in the PbI2/DMF system, whereas the MAPbI3 crystals fabricated using the Pb(NO3)2/water system failed to form a continuous capping film; thus, areas bare of TiO2 are evident in Fig. 4c. The defect in the MAPbI3 capping layer in the Pb(NO3)2/water system originates from the islandish deposition caused by spin-coating Pb(NO3)2, reflecting that the current film technology involving aqueous Pb(NO3)2 is far from perfect. Nevertheless, our results confirm that using an aqueous lead source instead of a toxic DMF solvent is a viable method for fabricating high-purity perovskite crystals and highly efficient PSCs featuring a PCE exceeding two digits.

In summary, we developed a novel precursor combination for fabricating highly efficient PSCs by using an aqueous Pb(NO3)2 solution and created water-processed PSCs with a 12.58% PCE under standard conditions (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on using water as the processing solvent for PSCs. Eliminating the use of polar, toxic processing solvents such as DMF enables the feasibility of green production for PSCs. Moreover, we determined that the formation of MAPbI3 from Pb(NO3)2 is a two-step reaction, proposing a possible mechanism involving the rapid formation of PbI2 intermediates and the slow reaction of PbI2 and MAI to form MAPbI3. The inherent advantages of this process can be realised; for example, stoichiometrically controlling multi-halide perovskite becomes easy because the iodide no longer exists in the precursor, but rather exists in the MAI solution. The wettability between the substrate and Pb(NO3)2 during spin-coating is another concern; our UV-ozone treatment is effective but imperfect and requires improvement to enable a full-coverage coating. This study reveals that fabricating highly efficient PSCs by using a cost-effective, environmentally friendly process is promising.
