    , Accepted 9th November 2014First published on 14th November 2014AbstractTunable size ZnO nanoarrays (NAs) sensitized with CdS, Ag2S, CdS/Ag2S quantum dots and solution processed 2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethoxy) ethyl undec-10-enyl malonate (EEMC) fullerenes have been developed as electron transport layers for improving polymer solar cells performance. ZnO NAs could provide direct and ordered electron channels for electron transportation. The optimized thickness of ZnO NAs was determined by means of contrast experiments with P3HT:PC61BM active layers. CdS, Ag2S shell and CdS/Ag2S double-shells could passivate the surface defects of ZnO NAs, increase the electron mobility and enhance light absorption. Moreover, EEMC assists the infiltration of the active layer into inorganic nanoarrays. Consequently, the performance of the inverted device based on thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) with ZnO/CdS/Ag2S/EEMC core/multi-shells NAs as electron transport layer has been greatly improved to 7.7% with a high short-circuit current density of 17.9 mA cm−2. Moreover, the fabrication process was low-cost and environment-friendly, which would be in favor of a large-scale production of polymer solar cells.
Introduction
In the past decade, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been receiving great attention due to their low-cost, good film-forming, light weight, flexibility and large-area manufacturability.1,2 Recently, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 10% has been reported due to the improvement in the synthesis of high efficiency donors, optimized device structure, interfacial morphology control and process optimization.3–5
Usually, the conventional and the inverted structure are the two main types of device architectures. The PSCs with conventional structure always suffer from the low-work-function metal cathode, susceptibility to degradation of the cathode by oxygen and water vapor, and the acidity and hygroscopicity of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), which can reduce the performance of the devices. To circumvent these problems, an inverted device structure is fabricated, where ITO is used as cathode to collect electrons, the high work-function metal (Ag or Au) is used as anode to collect holes, and an n-type metal oxide (ZnO or TiOx) is coated on ITO as electron transport layer (ETL). As a result, the device performance has been found to be improved significantly.5
Among the n-type metal oxides used in inverted cells, ZnO is a promising candidate due to its high electron mobility, physical and chemical stability and tunable optical properties.6,7 However, the major problems in using ZnO nanoparticle films as ETL are the poor spatial distribution and easy aggregation of the nanoparticles over a large area,8,9 the presence of defects with adsorbed oxygen,10,11 and the limited interfacial contact between the active layer and ETL. Therefore, it is urgent and desirable to develop a novel structure of ZnO ETL to obtain high-efficiency inverted polymer solar cells. The use of vertically aligned one-dimensional (1-D) ZnO nanoarrays (ZnO NAs) instead of disordered ZnO nanoparticle films can provide an ideal architecture to obtain larger and more optimized interfacial area between the active layer and ETL and offer controllable and direct pathways for the transportation of electrons towards the collection electrode, which subsequently leads to a decrease in the probability of electron/hole recombination and enhances the PCE.12–14 ZnO NAs is a promising candidate due to its high electron mobility and easy production at low temperature,15,16 and enlarged interfacial area between active layer and ETL. Moreover, ZnO NAs have less junctions compared to ZnO nanoparticles, which could help in optimizing the interpenetrating network of active layers to promote the charges transportation and collection at the corresponding electrode.17 In addition to being an electron transport layer, the n-type ZnO NAs in the proposed device configuration also acts as a second acceptor, resulting in an organic–inorganic contact that could pay a certain contribution of photocurrent.18 Nevertheless, the thick ZnO NAs films possess a high concentration of deep level defects and give rise to the trapping of electrons, which significantly influence the transportation of photogenerated charges towards the electrode.13,19,20 To overcome the defects of ZnO NAs for interfacial engineering in PSCs, functional ligands (such as silanes, carboxylic acid, alkyl thiols and fullerene derivative)21–25 are employed to passivate surface states of inorganic nanocrystals and reduce the electron depletion. Although organic interfacial modification could improve the compatibility between the active layers and the ZnO NAs layer, several primary issues should be considered such as the relative low electrical conductivity (even insulating nature) and loosely connected network of organic ligands, which could result in a limited transportation of photogenerated electrons to the electrode.26
Inorganic modifications of the surface of ZnO NAs is another promising method to boost the performance of PSCs. Lead sulfide (PbS),27–29 lead selenide (PbSe), cadmium sulfide (CdS) and cadmium selenide (CdSe)30–32 quantum dots (QDs) have been demonstrated to enhance photocurrent in metal-oxide nanowire arrays. To better engineer the semiconductor sensitizer structure, a quasi-quantum structure of zinc selenide (ZnSe)/cadmium selenide (CdSe)/zinc selenide (ZnSe)33 has been used to sensitize the solar cells, and a PCE of 6.2% is attained. In addition PbS/CdS QDs shells have been also employed to ameliorate titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorod arrays,27 and all the devices have revealed considerably faster electrons transport and considerably lesser recombination. However, the overuse of toxic Cd and Pb compounds may be eventually terminated because of the increasingly acrimonious environmental requirements.34 Silver sulfide (Ag2S) is environment-friendly and stable when exposed to acids and moisture, as well as near-infrared absorbed binary semiconductor with a narrow band gap of ∼0.9 eV.35 Zheng et al.36 first reported the fabrication of P3HT:Ag2S hybrid solar cells obtaining outstanding short-circuit current density (Jsc) around 20 mA cm−2 and PCE of 2.04%.
Herein, in view of the high concentration surface defects of ZnO NAs, a narrow-band gap semiconductor Ag2S was first applied to sensitize the ZnO NAs. Similarly, the CdS QDs,37–39 have been utilized to sensitize ZnO NAs because of its high stability under irradiation, good controllability in the fabrication process and excellent optical properties. Different shells were deposited on the top of ZnO NAs by a water-soluble and environment-friendly method, forming nanoarrays of the inner ZnO NAs core with outer shell of Ag2S and CdS, defined as ZnO/Ag2S NAs (ZA NAs) and ZnO/CdS NAs (ZC NAs), respectively. The thickness of corresponding NAs by controlling the hydrolysis time was primarily investigated. Taking multiple advantages (including the environment-friendly properties of Ag2S, good photo-electricity of CdS and solution processability of ZnO NAs) into consideration, the ZnO NAs core with multideck shells of CdS and Ag2S simultaneously, named as ZnO/CdS/Ag2S NAs (ZCA NAs) were successfully synthesized. Moreover, a solution-processed small organic molecule 2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethoxy) ethyl undec-10-enyl malonate (EEMC) had been synthesized,40 which can modify the inorganic surface defects and enhance the compatibility of organic active layer and inorganic nanoarrays for enhancing PCE,41 and the synthetic process and structure are shown in Fig. S1.† The mutual effect between the interfacial compatibilizer of solution-processed fullerenes and the electron acceptor fullerenes assisted the infiltration of active layers into inorganic nanoarrays, which would increase the interface areas to enhance the performance of PSCs devices. All the fabrication processes were environment-friendly, which would be beneficial for a large scale and low cost production of polymer solar cells.
Results and discussion
The synthesis process and structure of the device in this work are schematically illustrated in Scheme 1, and the detailed experiment and characterization sections are shown in the ESI.† The ZnO NPs nucleation centers were spin-coated on an ITO substrate, and subsequently the ZnO NAs were formed via a low temperature hydrothermal method and QDs shells were covered on ZnO NAs through a water-soluble and environment-friendly successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR).42

Fig. 1 shows the morphology images of ZnO NPs and ZnO NAs vertically aligned on the ITO substrate with different thickness by controlling the hydrolysis time. It could be estimated that ZnO NPs has a diameter of 5–10 nm, and it can be seen that the ZnO NAs are vertical and hexagonal, agreeing with previous reports.23,36 With a hydrolysis time ranging from 0 min to 120 min, the thickness of ZnO NAs remarkably changes from 39 ± 5 nm to 222 ± 10 nm, verified by the SEM and surface profilometer (AMBIOS TECHNOLOGY ltd. XP-2). The component of the nanoarrays has also been confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The inset of Fig. 1 shows the XPS spectra of Zn 2p and O 1s elements on the surface of the nanoarrays, which could prove the formation of ZnO NAs. Furthermore, in Fig. 1, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) presents that the lattice spacing of the nanoarrays is 0.52 nm in the 〈0001〉 direction, which is consistent with the known hexagonal wurtzite ZnO NAs.29,43 All the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses confirm that the ZnO NAs with an average diameter of 20–50 nm, an areal density of 300–400 nanoarrays per μm2, and an average inter-nanoarrays spacing of 10–20 nm, which agree with the charge-separating of 10 nm length-scale for reducing the recombination of the electron–hole pairs.44 It is well known that the intermixed nanostructure can enlarge the interfacial area for electron transporting,45,46 but very thick ZnO NAs layer could lead to high concentrations of surface defects and increasing recombination of charges. The optimized thickness of ZnO NAs layer for PSCs is discussed below.

The photovoltaic performance of ZnO NAs/P3HT:PC61BM devices are summarized in Fig. 2 and Table 1. The short-circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) are all improved when hydrolysis time ranges from 0 to 20 min (corresponding to thickness from 39 nm to 60 nm). The optimized device based on a ZnO NAs layer of 60 nm thickness achieves a PCE of 3.6% under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2), with Jsc of 9.68 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.58 V, and FF of 63.7%. The vertical ZnO NAs as ETL lead to a larger interfacial contact compared to ZnO NPs, and also provide direct, stable and fast pathways for the transportation of electrons and collection towards electrode.13 The cross-section image (Fig. 1) exhibits that the active layer immerse suitably into ZnO NAs, which provides a direct and stable pathway for the transportation of photogenerated electrons towards the collection electrode. Furthermore, the device reveals more light harvesting and enhanced Jsc by inserting a vertical aligned ZnO NAs optical spacer with appropriate thickness.47 However, with the hydrolysis time increasing to 120 min, a significantly decrease of Jsc (5.69 mA cm−2) and Voc (0.45 V) for ZnO NAs (222 nm) ETL is observed. Too thick ZnO NAs possess higher concentration surface defects and resist the infiltration of the active layer to some extent, thus resulting in poor interfacial contact and evident voids between the ZnO NAs layer and the active layer;48 moreover, the very thick ZnO NAs would reduce the electron conductivity of the buffer layer.

As shown in Fig. 3, all sensitized ZnO NAs (ZA NAs, ZC NAs and ZCA NAs) are vertically aligned on the ITO substrate, which are not remarkably altered compared to ZnO NAs (Fig. 1), and Ag2S and CdS quantum dots can be entirely covered onto the corresponding ZnO NAs (as shown in the XPS data). Cross-sectional SEM figure of ZCA NAs (Fig. 3) reveals that Ag2S and CdS quantum dots adsorb on the ZnO NAs together. TEM images (Fig. 3) analysis further confirms that the original ZnO NAs have been turned into ZA NAs after Ag2S deposition, in agreement with the XPS data, and Ag2S shell with a thickness of about 5 nm as quantum dots are in close proximity to the underlying nanoarrays. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (in Fig. S2†) of ZnO NAs and ZA NAs with different thickness of Ag2S shell present that ZnO NAs grow perfectly at the peak (002) of 34.4°, indicating the preferential growth along the 〈0001〉 direction,29 according to HRTEM (Fig. 1), and the thick shell contains large quantum dots with a higher diffraction peaks. The core/multi shells structure is a vertical configuration, which might be optimal for their integration into different top contact electrode devices.49 Cross-sectional SEM image of ZCA NAs/PTB7:PC71BM after an annealing treatment (Fig. 3) shows that the active layer could be successfully permeated into the ZnO NAs, which could enlarge the interfacial area between ETL and the active layer.

As shown in Fig. 4, the photo-electricity of ZnO nanoparticles and nanoarrays have been studied by photoluminescence (PL), and all samples display two emissions: one sharp emission at about 380 nm for near band edge (NBE), and the other broader one at 450–550 nm for deep level emission (DLE). However, ZnO NAs present a high concentration of surface defects at 450–550 nm, which could be passivated by introducing an environment-friendly narrow-band-gap Ag2S shell. The PL spectrum of ZA NAs displays similar emission profiles to ZnO NAs in the range from 350 to 600 nm. Upon depositing Ag2S, the Ag+ cations and S2− anions in solution will occupy zinc (Zn) vacancies and oxygen (O) vacancies. The Ag+ and S2− ions provide original nucleation for surface growth of Ag2S, which can reduce the surface defects on ZnO NAs correlating with the reduced DLE of PL. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves under illumination of inverted devices employed ZA NAs with different thickness of ZnO NAs as ETL with the architecture of ITO/ETL/P3HT:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag and are shown in Fig. S3,† and the corresponding parameters of the devices are listed in Table S1.† It is evident that the relative PCE of devices based on ZA NAs with different thickness of ZnO NAs are all low. Due to the mismatched energy level between Ag2S and the active layer, the Voc (0.1–0.2 V) is extremely low (Fig. S4†). To improve the energy level alignment, reduce the surface defects of ZnO NAs and increase the compatibility between the organic active layer and inorganic ETL, CdS QDs shell and solution processed EEMC sensitizing ZnO NAs with different thickness were applied as electron acceptor, and ETL of devices in PSCs have been studied simultaneously. The application of QDs and multiple shells could efficiently increase the reflection of light at the interface of ZnO NAs and promote the light absorption.47

Fig. 5 shows the steady-state J–V characteristics of devices based on ZnO NAs, ZnO NAs/EEMC, and ZC NAs/EEMC with different thickness of ETLs, and Table 2 reveals the entire photovoltaic performance of these devices. With the addition of EEMC, the PCE of the device with ZnO NAs/PTB7:PC71BM initially increases from 6.4% to 6.8%, and the Jsc enhances from 15.13 mA cm−2 to 15.35 mA cm−2, which is attributed to the good interfacial compatibility between the organic and inorganic active layer and to the less defects of ZnO after disposition of the EEMC on ZnO nanoarrays. When adopted ZnO NAs (60 nm) are sensitized by CdS shell and EEMC as ETL, the Jsc of device improves to 17.65 mA cm−2, resulting in a higher PCE of 7.6%. Moreover, the PCE and the Jsc exhibit a rapid decrease while extending the hydrolysis time, and the tendencies are as per the former results, as shown in Table 1. In order to combine the advantages of CdS, Ag2S and EEMC, ZnO NAs of different thickness sensitized with CdS/Ag2S double-shells/EEMC are used as ETL to improve the performance of devices based on PTB7:PC71BM. As shown in Fig. 6 and Table 3, the Jsc of devices with ZCA NAs ETL increase slightly when compared to those of devices based on ZC NAs ETL (in Table 2). As shown in Fig. 6, the energy level of ZC NAs/EEMC and ZCA NAs/EEMC are suitable for devices. Interestingly, the representative ZCA NAs (60 nm)/EEMC device achieves the highest device performance (PCE = 7.7%, Voc = 0.70 V, Jsc = 17.90 mA cm−2, FF = 61.4%) under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2). Compared to ZnO NPs, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the solar cells based on ZnO NAs (in Fig. 6) increases at around 380 nm, and the corresponding calculated Jsc improves, which is consistent with the value obtained from the J–V curve. More remarkably, EQE boosts significantly with the addition of the quantum dots and EEMC, which due to the optical grating effect leads to increase in light absorption (incident and back-reflected light),50 and EEMC assisting the infiltration of active layer into inorganic nanoarrays evidently improves the compatibility between the two and reduces the charges recombination.

In addition, the quantum dots have been reported to produce at least two or more electron–hole pairs when the absorption of a photon occurs,50 and to further explore the effect of the quantum dots, the electron transport characteristics of ZnO NPs/EEMC, ZnO NAs/EEMC, ZA NAs/EEMC, ZC NAs/EEMC and ZCA NAs/EEMC were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC), and the detailed measurements are shown in ESI.† The homologous electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/ETL/P3HT:PC61BM/LiF/Al is revealed in Fig. 7. As shown in Table S2,† due to the higher electrical conductivity of ZnO NAs, CdS and Ag2S than ZnO NPs, the device with ZCA NAs/EEMC demonstrates the highest electron mobility of 1.95 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas the device with bare ZnO NPs/EEMC reached the lowest electron mobility of 8.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. This further proved that the addition of QDs could enhance electrical conductivity of ZnO NAs.
 Fig. 7  (a) Electron mobilities of ZnO NPs/EEMC or ZnO NAs/EEMC, ZA NAs/EEMC, ZC NAs/EEMC, ZCA NAs/EEMC using the electron-only device measured at ambient temperature. The inset shows the configurations of the electron-only device ITO/ETL/P3HT:PC61BM/LiF/Al, and (b) XPS spectra of ZnO NAs, ZA NAs, ZC NAs, and ZCA NAs. 
XPS measurements were carried out to gain insight into the composition of ZnO NAs with different shells. Fig. 7 shows core level XPS spectra of Zn 2p and O 1s for ZnO NAs, ZC NAs, ZA NAs and ZCA NAs. During the deposition process, the Cd2+ and Ag+ cations in solution occupied Zn vacancies,51 and S2− anions in solution were readily captured by oxygen vacancies due to the analogous chemical properties of oxygen and sulfur atoms. The captured ions offered the initial nucleation for the surface growth of the quantum dots shells, which would result in reduced surface defects of oxygen and Zn vacancies. For ZnO NAs, the binding energy of Zn 2p3/2 peak is at 1021.7 eV. The maximum of Zn 2p3/2 peak shifts toward lower binding energy by 0.2 eV when adding the QDs shells onto ZnO NAs, which indicates that more Zn atoms are bounded to oxygen atoms.5 The O 1s XPS spectra demonstrate two peaks with non-symmetrical line shape. One peak with lower binding energy (530.0 eV) corresponds to O atoms in ZnO structure, and the higher peak at 531.5 eV is assigned to an oxygen-deficiency component, such as O 1s in Zn(OH)2, or the oxygen species adsorbed by the surface hydroxyl groups.52,53 The intensity of the peak at 531.5 eV for all the modified ZnO samples, particularly for ZCA NAs, is lower than that of pristine ZnO NAs. This indicates that adding QDs shells onto ZnO NAs avail to reduce the oxygen-deficient component and increase the number of Zn–O bonds in all samples, significantly for CdS/Ag2S multiple shells. In that case, the separation of charge is increased and the recombination of electron–hole pairs is reduced, which could enhance the performance of devices.
Conclusions
ZnO/Ag2S, ZnO/CdS core–shell nanoarrays and ZnO/CdS/Ag2S core–double-shells nanoarrays via an environment-friendly hydrolysis reaction as electron transport layers have been successfully applied to improve the photocurrent of PSCs. Ag2S, CdS shell and CdS/Ag2S double-shells were utilized to passivate deep level defects of ZnO NAs, which could significantly enhance the transport of photogenerated charges and the light absorption. Moreover, solution processed fullerenes (EEMC) were applied to increase compatibility between the organic active layer and inorganic electron transport layer. The sensitization of CdS, Ag2S and EEMC could reduce the defects, increase the electron transportation, and improve light absorption. As a result, the performance of the optimized device with ZC NAs (60 nm)/EEMC was effectively raised to 17.65 mA cm−2 of Jsc, 0.72 V of Voc, 59.8% of FF and 7.6% of PCE. The results imply that inorganic core–shell and core–double-shells nanoarrays are applicable to optimize device performance as electron transport layers with the advantages of low-cost, environment-friendly and large-scale production.
