    , Accepted 1st November 2018First published on 2nd November 2018AbstractHigh-performance organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are of great scientific and technological importance due to their potential large-scale industrial applications. Introducing semiconductor quantum dots has been proven to be an effective way to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs. In this paper, we report a novel approach to fabricate atomically thin antimonene quantum sheets (AMQSs) possessing a uniform size (≈2.2 nm) via imidazolium ionic liquid-assisted exfoliation. In this method, the yield of AMQSs (1.1 mg mL−1) has been increased by nearly two orders of magnitude compared with that of previously reported methods. Furthermore, upon adding AMQSs into the light absorber in OPVs, the optimal device with 1.0 mg mL−1 AMQSs shows the highest PCE of 9.75%, resulting in over 25% enhancement in PCE compared to that of the reference device. It also leads to a noticeable enhancement in the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.7% and the fill factor (FF) of 8.4%. The increased PCE is mainly due to the two-dimensional electronic structure of AMQSs that can enhance the light absorption, assist exciton dissociation and reduce charge recombination of OPVs. This work provides a new avenue toward mass production of two-dimensional quantum sheets and points to a new strategy for highly efficient OPVs.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted widespread attention of researchers due to their flexibility, low cost, sustainability and easy realization of large-scale production.1,2 In the past two decades, OPVs have achieved a gratifying development. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs is still much lower than that of inorganic and perovskite solar cells. Main challenges are the narrow absorption bandgap and relatively low charge carrier mobility due to the inherent nature of organic materials, and thus organic active layers are normally kept thin (ca. 100 nm) to ensure efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport.3 Recently, OPVs with PCEs of 14.08% (single-junction OPVs) and 17.3% (tandem OPVs) have been reported by combining the advantages of fullerene acceptors (high electron mobility) and nonfullerene acceptors (strong visible or near-infrared absorption).4,5 Apart from the progress in nonfullerene acceptors and interfacial modification materials for highly efficient OPVs, the enhancement of light absorption can be realized by doping two-dimensional (2D) materials in the active layers of OPVs due to the effects of light scattering and surface plasmon polaritons.6 Recently, 2D materials with a single atomic layer thickness also have shown immense potential for use in solar cells and other optoelectronic devices due to their outstanding optical and electrical properties.7–9
To date, several 2D materials including graphene,10–13 transition metal dichalcogenides,14–16 and black phosphorus (BP)6,17,18 have been incorporated into OPVs. In optoelectronic devices, low band gap values of 0.1–1.0 eV are usually demanded.19 Although graphene possesses amazing thermal and chemical stability and high transport mobility,7 it is not suitable for use in a photovoltaic active layer due to its zero bandgap. On the other hand, transition metal dichalcogenides normally exhibit a large bandgap of 1.5–2.5 eV.20 Very recently, BP possessing a band gap in the range of 0.3–2.0 eV (from bulk BP to single-layer BP) was reported, showing unique optical properties and high carrier mobilities.21,22 BP was successfully used in highly efficient OPVs,6,17,18 which means that BP and its analogues could be valid candidates for OPVs. Unfortunately, BP is very unstable under an air atmosphere, leading to rapid degradation.23,24 Therefore, it is urgent to develop novel BP analogues with an appropriate bandgap and good stability for OPVs.
Antimonene (AM), which can be simply isolated from bulk antimony (Sb), has been recently explored as an interesting 2D layered material like BP.25–27 The Sb atoms in monolayer β-phase AM consist of buckled rings, while the interaction between layers is through weak van der Waals forces (Fig. S1†). Sb, one of the typical semimetals in nature, is more stable than BP in air. The two-dimensional electronic structure of monolayer AM is the most stable buckle-like structure,28 with high electrical conductivity (104 S m−1),26 high carrier mobility29 and high thermal conductivity.30 Theoretical calculations point out that monolayer AM possesses a bandgap of 1.2–1.3 eV, which is suitable for optoelectronic applications.25,28 Accordingly, AM can be considered as a low bandgap 2D material to enhance the light absorption of OPVs. To date, AM has been fabricated by micromechanical exfoliation,25 epitaxial growth methods,26 and liquid-phase exfoliation.27 Nevertheless, the low production efficiency and poor dispersion are still thorny issues, which hinder the applications of AM.
Since an ionic liquid is a kind of green solvent with excellent physical and chemical properties, it has attracted increasing attention in the synthesis of 2D materials, such as graphene,31 MoS2,32 and BP.33,34 Herein, we propose an efficient strategy to synthesize 2D antimonene quantum sheets (AMQSs) via sonication-assisted exfoliation of Sb powder in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoroacetate ([EMIM]CF3COO). Notably, the obtained AMQSs show a highly uniform size and thickness, and the original AMQS suspensions with high concentration are very stable in air. Furthermore, AMQSs are introduced into the active layers of two representative inverted OPVs based on poly{4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl) carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-4,6-diyl}:[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7:PC71BM) and poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM), and their contribution to the photovoltaic performance is explored in this study for the first time. As a result, the inverted OPVs achieve significant enhancement in the PCE, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF), much higher than those of the reference cell and the latest report on BP for OPVs.6 In comparison with the reference device, improved light absorption, enhanced exciton dissociation and reduced charge recombination are observed after the addition of AMQSs. This work presents the prospect of mass production of 2D quantum sheets and a valid approach for attaining highly efficient OPVs.
Experimental
Controllable preparation of antimonene quantum sheets (AMQSs)
Antimony (Sb) shots (99.999%) were purchased from Aladdin. [EMIM]CF3COO (≥99%) was purchased from Lanzhou Greenchem ILs, LICP, CAS (Lanzhou, China). AMQSs were prepared by probe sonication-assisted exfoliation. First, Sb shots were pulverized to prepare Sb powder by grinding in an agate mortar for 1 h. Then, 30 mg of powdered Sb was put into a 20 mL vial with 10 mL of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoroacetate ([EMIM]CF3COO). Subsequently, the Sb powder solution was continuously sonicated for 10 h in an ice bath at 500 W, delivering the ultrasound power in pulses 1 s long every 2 s (GUIGO-92-IIDN ultrasonic processor equipped with a 6 mm sonotrode, China). The resulting dispersion was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 30 min, and then the supernatant was centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 1 h. After that, the precipitation was washed several times with ultra-pure water. Finally, the precipitation was redispersed in ultra-pure water or dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for future use. Simultaneously, we obtained a large size of AM nanosheets by controlling the duration of the ultrasound, such as continuously sonicating for 4 h. As shown in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. S2†), the size of AM nanosheets is about 5 nm.
Device fabrication
PTB7 and PC71BM were obtained from 1-Material of United States and Luminescence Technology Corporation of Taiwan, respectively. MoO3, P3HT and PC61BM were purchased from Rieke Company. ZnO precursor solution was spin coated on UV ozone-treated ITO substrates and then thermally annealed at 200 °C for 1 h in air.13 10 mg of PTB7, 15 mg of PC71BM and 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 or 6.0 mg of AMQSs were dispersed in chlorobenzene and 1,8-diiodooctane (97:3 by volume, 1 mL), or 20 mg of P3HT, 20 mg of PC61BM and 0 or 0.5 mg of AMQSs were dispersed in o-dichlorobenzene (1 mL) to obtain the blend solution. Then, the blend layer was spin coated on top of the ZnO using the blend solutions in a N2-protected glovebox. After spin coating, the P3HT:PC61BM-based samples were slowly dried in a glass Petri dish, followed by thermal annealing at 120 °C for 15 min. A 5 nm thick MoO3 and an 80 nm thick Al electrode were then deposited on the blend layer in a vacuum chamber. The device structures were ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/PTB7:PC71BM:AMQSs (95 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/Al (80 nm) and ITO/ZnO(40 nm)/P3HT:PC61BM:AMQSs (200 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/Al (80 nm), respectively.
Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan) and atomic-force microscopy (AFM, SPA-300HV, Japan) were applied to characterize the morphology of the AMQSs and the films of ITO/ZnO/PTB7:PC71BM:AMQSs (the concentrations of AMQSs were 0, 1.0 and 6.0 mg mL−1). Raman spectra were recorded using a Renishaw in via Raman microscope system with an excitation wavelength of 514 nm. UV/vis absorption spectra were obtained using a UV/vis spectrophotometer (HITACHI U-3900). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a Horiba Fluoromax 4 (HORIBA Jobin Yvon). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS ULTRA DLD, English) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Discover, Germany) were used to analyze the crystal structure of AMQSs. A Newport solar simulator system was used to measure current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics, PCE, and external quantum efficiency (EQE). The J–V characteristics of the OPVs were measured under a calibrated AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. A calibrated monosilicon diode was fixed as the reference, exhibiting a response at 300–800 nm.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 displays the fabrication process and photos of AMQSs. Highly dispersed AMQSs are prepared via ion-intercalation and probe sonication-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation of bulk Sb in [EMIM]CF3COO (Fig. 1a and b). To enhance the dispersity and stability of AMQSs in physiological medium polar imidazole rings are selected as the protective layer on the surface of AMQSs, which was similar to the exfoliation of bulk BP in an ionic liquid.34 Then, the chemical composition of the prepared AMQSs was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. S3†). The XPS survey spectrum shows predominant Sb, O, N and F elements, which proves that the [EMIM]CF3COO is coordinated with the AMQSs. Due to the hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties of [EMIM]CF3COO, the prepared AMQSs can be stably dispersed in both polar and non-polar solvents (water, DMF, acetone and chlorobenzene (CB)) and appeared brown (Fig. 1c), which is crucial to the application of AMQSs in photoelectric devices. By ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry (Fig. S4†), we work out the concentration of the obtained AMQSs, about 1.1 mg mL−1, based on the standard curve method, which is much higher than the reported concentration (1.74 × 10−3 mg mL−1).27 Fig. S5† shows the optical photographs of the original supernatant of the samples prepared by different methods, which clearly show that the concentration of the AMQSs prepared by [EMIM]CF3COO exfoliation is much higher than that in other solvents. Fig. 1d shows the UV-vis spectra of AMQSs, which can absorb light from UV to 750 nm, covering the main absorption region of the OPVs. After 30 days, the UV-vis spectra of AMQSs show little change, indicating that the dispersivity of the obtained AMQS dispersions is very excellent in air.

Fig. 2 shows an exhaustive study of the structural characteristics of AMQSs. As shown in the TEM image (Fig. 2a), AMQSs are well-dispersed in the solvent and uniform in shape and size. Over 450 samples were measured to get the diameter distribution of AMQSs as shown in Fig. 2d. The result indicates that the monodispersed AMQSs possess an average size of 2.18 nm. Fig. 2b presents the structural features of a single AMQS by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). The lattice fringes of 0.18–0.19 nm can be assigned to the (006) plane of the Sb crystal. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2b, the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern confirms its single-crystalline characteristic belonging to the (006) plane. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization of AMQSs is shown in Fig. 2c, from which we can clearly recognise that the height of counted AMQSs is about 0.9 nm. Then, more than forty sheets are statistically analysed to obtain a histogram of the thickness of the prepared AMQSs (Fig. 2e). The results show that the average thickness of AMQSs is 0.9 nm, corresponding to one or two layers. The crystal structure of AMQSs was further confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 2f shows the Raman spectra of bulk Sb and AMQSs excited by a 514 nm laser. After exfoliation, the A1g mode peak at 139.8 cm−1 and the Eg mode peak at 104.7 cm−1 for bulk Sb shift to 148.5 cm−1 and 113.7 cm−1, which is similar to a previous report.35 From the XRD patterns of bulk Sb and AMQSs (Fig. S6†), we find that all the diffraction patterns of bulk Sb can be assigned to hexagonal Sb (JCPDS nO. 350732) and the diffraction patterns of AMQSs are indexed to the (012), (110) and (202) planes of the crystalline hexagonal Sb. Nevertheless, the peaks of AMQSs are dramatically weakened compared to those of bulk Sb, since the graphene-like nanosheets lack long-range atomic order in the third dimension.36

The broad absorption spectrum, high dispersion and good stability of AMQSs motivated us to intercalate them into OPVs. Fig. 3 depicts the device structure and performance characterization of AMQS-doped OPVs. Fig. 3a shows the inverted OPV structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7:PC71BM or PTB7:PC71BM:AMQSs/MoO3/Al. The energy levels of ITO, ZnO, MoO3,37 PTB7, PC71BM,38 and AMQSs30 are from the reported literature, as shown in Fig. 3b. A cascaded band structure can be formed in OPVs, which is conducive to charge carrier separation and can reduce carrier recombination.38Fig. 3c shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OPVs without and with AMQSs. A summary of detailed photovoltaic parameters is listed in Table S1.† The concentration of AMQSs was varied from 0 to 6 mg mL−1 for optimizing the photovoltaic performance. The optimal reference device with a Voc of 0.74 V, a Jsc of 15.72 mA cm−2, a FF of 66.3%, and a PCE of 7.76% was made for comparison study in this work. The optimal device with 1.0 mg mL−1 AMQSs shows the highest PCE of 9.75%, leading to a 25.6% enhancement in PCE compared to that of the reference device. In comparison with other materials in OPVs, AMQS-doped cells as well as P(NDI2OD-T2)-doped cells show significantly enhanced PCE,39 much higher than that of BPQD-doped cells (Table S2†).6 It is clear that the addition of AMQSs remarkably enhances the Jsc (18.34 mA cm−2) and FF (71.9) of the device when the concentration of AMQSs is increased from 0 to 1 mg mL−1. However, the photovoltaic performance is decreased at higher concentration of AMQSs (>1 mg mL−1). As shown in Fig. 3d, external quantum efficiencies (EQE) were compared to better determine the performance of the devices. The devices comprising AMQSs show improved EQE profiles, leading to enhanced Jsc values.

Usually, Jsc is related to both optical and electrical processes. Fig. 4 displays a detailed study to illustrate the improvement of Jsc in the AMQS-doped cells. First, we compare the UV/vis absorption spectra of PTB7:PC71BM films with and without AMQSs, as shown in Fig. 4a. In comparison with the absorption of a pure PTB7:PC71BM blend film, a significant improvement of light absorption is observed in PTB7:PC71BM:AMQS blend films due to the utilization of AMQSs, which can be ascribed to the broadband light absorption and scattering of AMQSs in the active layers. The enhancement factors for UV-vis spectra, as shown in Fig. S7,† exhibit enhanced light absorption from UV to 750 nm, corresponding well to the absorption spectra of AMQSs.

(b) Jph–Veff characteristics, (c) P(E,T)–Veff characteristics, and (d) the values of Gmax and P(E,T) obtained for the cells with different concentrations of AMQSs in their active layers. 
Besides affecting the optical properties, AMQSs could also alter the electrical properties. To explore the electrical contribution of AMQSs, the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) was compared in this study, following the approach reported by Mihailetchi et al.40Fig. 4b shows the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage. Obviously, two different regimes are observed in the Jph–Veff characteristics. The Jph linearly increases with Veff in the low effective voltage regime. Then, it gradually approaches the saturated photocurrent (Jsat). Due to the field-dependent behavior of exciton dissociation in OPVs, all generated excitons dissociate into free charge carriers under high internal electric field. Hence, the Gmax can be estimated in OPVs. The calculated values of Gmax for a reference cell without AMQSs and the cells with AMQSs are shown in Fig. 4d. The enhanced Gmax reflects the outstanding charge transport and collection behavior, leading to a high Jsc in AMQS incorporating OPVs.
Next, the exciton dissociation probabilities P(E,T) are studied,40 where E and T are the electric field and temperature, respectively. The values of normalized Jph/Jsat are displayed in Fig. 4c and the calculated P(E,T) values are shown in Fig. 4d. The value of P(E,T) increases from 82.1% in the reference cell to 94.8% in the AMQS-doped cell with 1 mg mL−1, indicating that incorporating AMQSs into cells benefits exciton dissociation. Thus, the improved P(E,T) is highly related to the improved Jsc in AMQS-doped cells. Then, the PL spectra of PTB7, PTB7:AMQSs and PTB7:PC71BM:AMQSs were studied (Fig S8†). The addition amount of AMQSs is 1.0 mg mL−1. The PL intensity of PTB7:AMQSs is decreased compared with the intensity of PTB7, which means that the addition of AMQSs partially quenches the generated excitons in PTB7. The quenched excitons have the chance to dissociate into free charge carriers, leading to enhanced Jsc. When the acceptor material PC71BM is added, the PL intensity of PTB7:PC71BM:AMQSs almost disappears, which means that the generated excitons are almost completely quenched in the light absorber.
A systematic study of morphology analyses and light-intensity-dependent J–V characteristic measurements were carried out to unravel the origin of the improvement in the performance of the OPVs with AMQSs in the active layer. As shown in Fig. S9,† the surface morphology of the active layers of ITO/ZnO/PTB7:PC71BM:AMQSs (the concentrations of AMQSs are 0, 1 or 6 mg mL−1) was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The surface root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of a pristine ITO/ZnO/PTB7:PC71BM is 1.73 nm, whereas the RMS roughness decreases to 1.64 nm after adding 1.0 mg mL−1 AMQSs into the active layer, exhibiting a negligible morphology change. But when the additive amount is 6 mg mL−1, the RMS roughness decreases to 1.51 nm, which results in phase separation variation. Therefore, the morphology change is responsible for the declined performance in OPVs with high concentration of AMQSs (over 1 mg mL−1).
To investigate the charge recombination behaviors in the cells, the light intensity-dependent J–V characteristics were measured (Fig. 5).13,41 The Jsc of cells follows a power-law dependence on the intensity of the incident light. The Jsc–I characteristics are plotted in Fig. 5a, and the exponential factors α obtained by fitting for the reference and AMQS-doped cells are listed in Table S3.† Each α value is very close to 1, and the α values have been improved after introducing the AMQSs, indicating the efficient charge transport and collection processes. Furthermore, the photogenerated charge carriers recombine under open circuit conditions in the cells. Hence, the charge recombination behaviors can be directly reflected by the light intensity dependent Voc. The Voc with the semi-logarithmic of the light intensity exhibits a linear relationship with a slope of kT/e,42 where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in kelvin, and e is the elementary charge. The dependence of the Voc as a function of incident light intensity is shown in Fig. 5b. The values of the slope (s) are summarized in Table S3.† A lower slope means decreased Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination. A slope of 1.14 kT/e is obtained for the reference cell. A smaller slope of 1.02 kT/e is observed for the AMQS-doped cell with 1 mg mL−1. In comparison with the reference cell, decreased Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination is observed after incorporating AMQSs into PTB7:PC71BM blend films, implying suppressed trap defects in blended films.43 Consequently, the addition of AMQSs reduced the effect of defects in PTB7:PC71BM films, resulting in enhanced Jsc and FF for AMQS-doped cells. Finally, in order to study the effect of AMQSs on device stability, we tested the performance of the unpackaged devices (with and without 1.0 mg mL−1 of AMQSs). As shown in Fig. S10,† the PCEs of the reference device and the device with AMQSs decrease by 11.9% and 9.4% after 96 h of operation. In comparison with the reference device, the device with AMQSs (1.0 mg mL−1) shows slow degradation. This result means that the stability of the device with 1.0 mg mL−1 of AMQSs is slightly better compared to that of the reference device.

To study the general effect of AMQSs in OPVs, devices based on P3HT:PC61BM were also fabricated with different concentrations of AMQSs under the same conditions. Fig. S11† shows the J–V characteristics of the optimal OPVs without and with AMQSs. Detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S4.† The optimal device with 0.5 mg mL−1 AMQSs shows the highest Jsc of 11.91 mA cm−2, a FF of 64.2% and a PCE of 4.32%, leading to a 21.7% enhancement in PCE compared to that of the optimal reference device. The similar enhancement in the P3HT:PC61BM system proves the general applicability of AMQSs in OPVs.
Conclusions
In summary, stable AMQSs are synthesized in high-yield via sonication-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation of bulk Sb in [EMIM]CF3COO. The obtained AMQSs with high concentration (1.1 mg mL−1) possess a uniform size (≈2.2 nm) and thickness (≈0.9 nm). AMQSs can be dispersed in a couple of polar and non-polar solvents for different applications. Furthermore, AMQSs have been successfully integrated into OPVs, which leads to a noticeable enhancement in Jsc of 16.7%, FF of 8.4% and PCE of 25.6% for optimal devices, mainly ascribed to the enhancement of light absorption and exciton dissociation and reduced charge recombination loss, respectively. This work has realized a new strategy for mass production of two-dimensional quantum sheets and improving the performance of photovoltaic devices.
