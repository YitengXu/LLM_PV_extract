    , Accepted 3rd October 2017First published on 4th October 2017AbstractNew generation solar cells are necessary to replace current silicon solar panels for low cost and high energy conversion efficiency. The perovskite photovoltaic device is a rising star among the 3rd generation solar cells due to its rapidly increased energy conversion efficiency. Recently invented Na-embedded carbon (Na@C) nanowalls, which possess ultrahigh conductivity and a large accessible surface area, are a very promising electrode material. Herein, the Na@C nanowall material was demonstrated as an excellent counter electrode for HTM-free perovskite solar cells (PSCs), leading to a high power conversion efficiency of 8.89% under the AM 1.5G simulated sunlight. This efficiency is almost two times as high as that (4.56%) of a PSC with regular graphene synthesized via chemical exfoliation of graphite.
Introduction
Being renewable and clean, solar energy is very promising to substitute fossil energy in the future. Solar cells provide an efficient way to convert solar energy into electricity.1–7 Over the past few years, organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention due to their excellent photovoltaic performance with rapidly increased power conversion efficiency (PCE).8–15 Perovskite photovoltaic devices were based on the structure of dye-sensitized solar cells at first,16,17 and then it was found that perovskites can act as both an electron and hole transport layer, leading to the devices based on a planar structure.18–20 However, the use of hole transport materials (HTMs) bears a large proportion of cost for such solar cells. Furthermore, HTMs can easily absorb steam to cause the degradation of perovskite layers.21 To solve this issue, hole-conductor free mesoscopic perovskite solar cells were developed.22,23
The HTM-free perovskite solar cell with a PCE of 5.5% was first reported by L. Etgar et al. in 2012.24 The device employed TiO2 nanosheets with exposed (001) facets and MAPbI3 perovskite to form a perovskite/TiO2 heterojunction, in which the MAPbI3 nanoparticle perovskite was assumed to play the roles of both a light harvester and a hole-conductor, eliminating additional HTMs. Then, the group improved the efficiency to 10.85%.25 The photovoltaic performance of the HTM-free perovskite solar cell was strongly dependent on the depletion layer width created at the TiO2/MAPbI3 junction. However, the back contact (namely, the counter electrode) in such devices was still expensive gold, which would limit the commercialization of PSCs. To solve this issue, inexpensive carbon nanomaterials,26–30 such as carbon nanotubes31–33 and graphene,34,35 were exploited as back contact for HTM-free PSCs. Han et al. first developed a carbon black/graphite CE in a TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/ZrO2/carbon PSC, achieving a PCE of 6.64%.26 This work has stimulated intensive interest to develop carbon based counter electrodes (CEs).36–38
An ideal carbon CE for HTM-free PSCs would have effective back contact, fast carrier mobility, and superior electrical conductivity.34 However, it's difficult for carbon materials to simultaneously possess high surface hole extraction and bulk electrical conductivity. Doping alkali metals into carbon materials could tremendously increase electrical conductivity.39–43 However, as the dopants are located on the carbon surface, they can be easily oxidized, leading to a decrease in conductivity. Very recently, we solved this issue with a novel strategy, in which alkali metal atoms can be completely surrounded by carbon atoms, creating Na-embedded carbon with a nanowall structure. Its electrical conductivity is 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of highly conductive 3D graphene, which makes it an ideal electrode material for energy devices.6,44 In this work, this novel material was demonstrated as an effective counter electrode for HTM-free PSCs, leading to a high PCE of 8.89%.
Experimental section
Synthesis and characterization of highly conductive porous Na-embedded carbon (Na@C)
Na-embedded carbon (Na@C) nanowalls were synthesized based on our invented approach,6 which is briefly described as follows: sodium was loaded into a ceramic tube reactor, followed by introducing 50 psi CO gas. Then, the reactor was heated to 600 °C and kept at that temperature for 24 hours. The obtained products were washed by 36.5 wt% hydrochloric acid (HCl) to remove Na2CO3, followed by washing with deionized water several times. After being dried overnight, the Na@C nanowall sample was obtained.
The Na@C was first subjected to X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements using a Scintag XDS-2000 powder diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation in the range of 10–70°. The Raman spectra of graphene were obtained using an Olympus BX41 spectrometer with a helium–neon laser to excite the samples. A Hitachi-4700 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) was employed to evaluate the morphology of Na@C. The sheet resistance of Na@C was evaluated using a Jandel four-point probe system with an RM3 test unit. Surface areas were measured using nitrogen adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) with a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 adsorption instrument.
Synthesis of chemical-exfoliation graphene (CEG) from graphite
A modified Hummers method was employed to synthesize graphite oxide:45 0.5 g of graphite, 0.5 g of sodium nitrate, 3 g of potassium permanganate, and 25 mL of sulfuric acid were mixed at room temperature, followed by keeping at 35 °C for 5 hours to form a thick paste. Then, 40 mL of DI water was added to the paste with stirring. After it was heated at 90 °C for 30 min, 100 mL of deionized water and 10 mL of 30% H2O2 were added. Finally, the obtained graphite oxide sample was washed by deionized water several times, followed by drying in a vacuum furnace at 50 °C. The obtained graphite oxide was dissolved in deionized (DI) water and exfoliated to graphene oxide by the ultra-sonic treatment for 48 hours. Then, the graphene sheets were obtained by the chemical reduction of the graphene oxide with NaBH4 at room temperature, followed by washing with DI water and drying at 80 °C overnight. The obtained sample is denoted as chemical-exfoliation graphene (CEG).
Synthesis of CH3NH3I
CH3NH3I was synthesized by reaction of 30 mL of methylamine (40% in methanol, TCI) and 32.3 mL of hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a 250 mL flask at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring. The precipitate was recovered by putting the solution on a rotary evaporator and carefully removing the solvents at 50 °C. The yellowish raw product of methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was washed with diethyl ether three times, for each of which the solution was stirred for 30 min. Then, CH3NH3I was recrystallized from a mixed solvent of diethyl ether and ethanol. After filtration, the solid was collected and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
20 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) was first spin-coated on a fluorine doped SnO2 glass substrate (FTO, TEC-8, Hartford glass CO.), followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min in air to prevent the direct contact between the FTO and the hole-conducting layer. PbI2 was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide at a concentration of 460 mg mL−1 and kept at 70 °C. Then, it was spin-coated on the top of the TiO2 layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s, gently dried in air, and heated up to 70 °C for 15 min. After that, the top of the film was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s with the CH3NH3I solution, in which 10 mg CH3NH3I was dissolved in 1 mL 2-propanol with Na@C (or CEG, or activated carbon) using ultrasonic techniques, to form CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite on the TiO2 layer, and dried in air. Finally, a perovskite solar cell was obtained by preparing a carbon counter electrode on the film by doctor-blade coating Na@C (or CEG, or activated carbon), followed by vaporizing the solvent and heating at 120 °C for 1 h.
Characterization of perovskite solar cells
The photovoltaic performances of the perovskite solar cells were evaluated using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E) under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 at the range of 320–1100 nm using a solar simulator (Newport). Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were obtained after the simulated sunlight was focused through a monochromator (Newport). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data of the PSC was obtained at 10 mV amplitude over the frequency range of 1–100 kHz using a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation under dark conditions.
Results and discussion
The Na-embedded carbon material (Na@C) was synthesized from our invented reaction of Na liquid and CO gas at a temperature of 600 °C for 24 h. The products were subjected to X-ray diffraction (XRD) evaluation. As shown in Fig. 1a, broad diffraction peaks at 2θ = 24.88° and 43.41° were observed, which can be indexed to the (002) plane and (100) plane, respectively. This indicates that the Na@C material is amorphous. The structure of Na@C was further evaluated by Raman. The D-band at 1350 cm−1 corresponds to sp3 carbon atoms associated with functional groups, whereas the G-band at 1580 cm−1 is due to sp2 carbon atoms associated with graphene sheets. This further confirms that the Na@C materials not only have rich functional groups but also possess amorphous features. As described in our previous work,6 inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) combination demonstrated that about 1 wt% metallic Na atoms were embedded inside the carbon.

The morphology of Na@C was evaluated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). As shown in Fig. 2, one can see that Na@C possesses the porous nanowall-like structure with a thickness of about 50 nm. Furthermore, surface areas and pore size distributions were determined by N2 adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature. The BET surface area is 821 m2 g−1. The electrical conductivity of the Na@C sample was measured by the four-point probe method to be 508 S cm−1, which is 100 times larger than those of 3D graphene materials.4,7 The high conductivity and large surface area of Na@C make it an excellent electrode candidate for energy devices, which stimulated us to explore it as a counter electrode for HTM-free PSCs.

The Na@C was evaluated for HTM-free perovskite solar cells in this work. Fig. 3a shows the cell configuration, in which the HTM layer was eliminated. As shown in Fig. 3b, HTM-free solar cells with Na@C as a counter electrode exhibited a PCE of 5.20% with a Jsc of 15.05 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.75 V, and ff of 0.46. For comparison, a perovskite solar cell with a counter electrode of Pt was also fabricated which showed a Jsc of 17.48 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.77 V, ff of 0.39, and PCE of 5.21% (Fig. 3b). This indicates that the performance of the Na@C counter electrode is comparable to that of the Pt one. To decrease the contact resistance of the Na@C electrode and the perovskite layer, Na@C was introduced into the solution of perovskite precursors. As a result, a transition layer, in which part of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite molecules were highly dispersed on Na@C, was formed between the perovskite layer and the Na@C counter electrode. Fig. 4a shows the configuration (HTM-free TiO2//CH3NH3PbI3/Na@C//Na@C) of fabricated perovskite solar cells, in which the HTM layer was eliminated and the novel metal electrode was replaced by Na@C.

The photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cells with Na@C was also evaluated. The photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves are presented in Fig. 4a and the parameters are summarized in Table 1. As expected, the Na@C based HTM-free solar cell exhibited a high PCE of 8.89% with a Jsc of 17.94 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.78 V, and ff of 0.64. Furthermore, the hysteresis was not observed for the perovskite solar cell with the Na@C counter electrode. The monochromatic incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) data are illustrated in Fig. 4b. The integral photocurrent from the IPCE spectra is 17.1 mA cm−2, in good agreement with the experimentally obtained Jsc.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is carried out, in which the potential bias is applied from 100 to 900 mV in the dark in the frequency range from 105 to 0.1 Hz, as shown in Fig. 5. The first semi-circle in the high frequency region is assigned to the charge exchange process at the perovskite/CE interface, while the one at low frequencies represents the TiO2/perovskite interface. The negative capacitance appears in the low frequency region corresponding to an additional recombination pathway at a high forward bias at one of the interfaces.

For comparison, the PSCs with CEG and activated carbon were also prepared. The CEG based PSC exhibited a PCE of 4.56%, Jsc of 17.24 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.75 V, and ff of 0.35, whereas the activated carbon-based PSC shows a PCE of 4.92%, Jsc of 16.26 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.75 V, and ff of 0.40. This indicates that the PCE (8.89%) of the Na@C cell is almost two times as large as those of the CEG-based cell and activated carbon-based cells (Fig. 6). This happened because Na in the Na@C significantly increases the electrical conductivity of carbon, which is much larger than those of activated carbon and CEG.

Conclusions
Highly conductive porous Na-embedded carbon nanowalls (Na@C) were successfully synthesized via the invented reaction. Furthermore, the Na@C material exhibited excellent performance as a counter electrode for HTM-free perovskite solar cells, leading to a high power conversion efficiency of 8.89%. This efficiency is almost two times as large as that of CEG based PSCs.
