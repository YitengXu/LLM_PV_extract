    , Accepted 14th April 2023First published on 2nd May 2023AbstractNa3R(BO3)2 (R = La–Gd) borates, grown with Na2O–B2O3–NaF flux, crystallize in the space group P21/n. Contrary to previously published data, the peaks in the 980(La)–950(Gd) °C range are attributed to phase transition process, while the melting process occurs at about 100° higher. Another feature of thermal behavior consists of the gradual decomposition of the compound into Na3R2(BO3)3. The end member in the decomposition series is Na2R2O(BO3)2, which originates under oxygen/water atmosphere. In addition, the components of the thermal expansion tensor and the dependings of the unit-cell parameters of Na3Nd(BO3)2 on temperature were defined. A series of Pr3+, Nd3+, and Sm3+-doped Na3Gd(BO3)2 (NGB) borates were prepared from mixtures of grown crystals by solid-state synthesis, and their photoluminescence properties were studied in detail. The excitation and emission spectra of NGB: Pr3+ and NGB: Nd3+ are comparable with similar compounds, and the relative intensity reaches the maximum at 1 mol% of Pr3+, Sm3+, and 10 mol.% for Nd3+ doping.
Introduction
The technological revolution has produced solid-state lasers and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).1–3 Since that moment, optical technologies have significantly improved and changed various science and technology fields.4–6 Today, the search for cost-effective environment-friendly and energy-efficient materials with outstanding optical and photoluminescent characteristics for various photonics devices is one of the main challenges in materials science.
Inorganic compounds doped with REE (rare earth elements) ions are considered as candidates for universal materials, which are able to generate various wavelengths for lighting devices, displays, etc.7–11 A large number of articles describe luminescent and nonlinear optical materials, which are devoted to the study of REE-containing and/or REE-doped borate compounds, showing the potential of their application in optoelectronic circuits and devices.12–21 One of the most significant families of such compounds are represented by alkaline borates and REE-containing alkaline borates.22–29
Nowadays lithium-, sodium-, and potassium-containing borates with REE ions attract increasing attention due to their low cost, low formation reaction temperature, excellent optical properties, and considerably high physicochemical stability. In addition, such borates can withstand the harsh exposure conditions of ultraviolet radiation.30 Within the large family of alkaline rare-earth borates and oxoborates, a group of monoclinic compounds with the general formula A3R(BO3)2 (where A = Li, Na, K; R = La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb) is well-known.23,31–36 Along with the standard luminescent application35,37,38 of these compounds, one may find the data on very strong green radiation of K3Tb(BO3)2 under X-ray excitation.26 Furthermore, this class of compounds may be a promising host for high-level nuclear waste.26
Among this group, a series of relatively new compounds with A = Na and corresponding general formula Na3R(BO3)2 can be distinguished. According to,23,35 Na3R(BO3)2 (R = Pr, Sm, and Eu) have an incongruent melting temperature in the range of 960–980 °C. A number of papers showed that Na3R(BO3)2 crystalize in the centrosymmetric space group P21/c23,39,40 (or P21/n,35 which is equal to P21/c but characterized by another crystal setting). Moreover, some luminescent properties of Na3R(BO3)2 compounds have also been described.23,35,41–45 It was shown that the maximum luminescence intensity can be achieved with the concentrations of 50 mol% of Tb3+ (ref. 42) and 12 mol% of Eu3+.43 The use of flux is a popular technique to obtain borate crystals for further investigations since the phase purity is higher compared to the solid-state synthesis approach. To this moment, the size of the crystals still doesn't exceed several mm;26 thus, the need for finding another flux composition is actual.
In this work, single crystals of borates with the general formula Na3R(BO3)2 (where R = La–Gd) were grown with modified flux based on the Na2O–B2O3–NaF mixture. The thermal properties and structural features of the grown crystals have been studied. In addition, the mixtures of Na3Gd1−x(BO3)2:xPr3+/Nd3+/Sm3+ were prepared from grown crystals and sintered at 950 °C. The luminescent properties were studied, and the optimal luminescent ion concentrations in the mixtures were determined.
Results and discussion
Crystal structure of Na3R(BO3)2
According to the X-ray diffraction data, Na3R(BO3)2 (R = La, Gd) compounds have the centrosymmetric space group P21/n at room temperature, and their unit cell parameters as well as the unit cell parameters of the mixtures Na3Gd1−x(BO3)2:xPr3+/Nd3+/Sm3+ are given in Table 1. The crystal structure of the compounds is based on the heteropolyhedral framework formed by dimers of edge-shared highly distorted (RO8)-polyhedra, which are linked by (BO3)3−-triangles. Two types of sodium polyhedra coordinated by eight and six oxygen atoms fill the wide channels along the [100] direction (Fig. 1).

 Fig. 1  The general view of the crystal structure of compounds with the general formula Na3R(BO3)2. 
As can be seen from Table 1, the unit cell parameters change proportionally with the radius of the REE. Thus, the largest unit cell has a compound with lanthanum and the smallest with gadolinium.
Thermal properties
As shown in Fig. 2, all the DSC curves of Na3R(BO3)2 have two endothermic peaks. The peaks in the temperature range of 980(La)–950(Gd) °C most apparently correspond to phase transitions, whereas the further heating of the samples leads to the appearance of a second peak in the temperature range of 1070(La)–1100(Gd) °C, which presumably corresponds to the melting process. The full DSC curve of Na3Nd(BO3)2 is given in Fig. S3.†
 Fig. 2  DSC curves of Na3R(BO3)2, where R = La(a), Pr(b), Nd(c), Sm(d), Eu(e), and Gd(f). 
The PXRD patterns of the Na3R(BO3)2 subjected to annealing at 1200 °C (air atmosphere) during 0.5 h are shown in Fig. S1.† According to the obtained data, after melting the compounds, Na3R(BO3)2 partially decomposes to form oxoborates Na2R2O(BO3)2. It should be noted that with repeated DSC experiments for Na3Nd(BO3)2, the position of the peak is reproduced and the material losses do not exceed 1 wt% even if the sample is held at maximum temperature (1000 °C) for ∼2 hours (Fig. S2†). This is just in partial agreement with the previously published data,23,35 where the authors claimed that peaks at temperatures of about 1000 °C correspond to the complete decomposition of Na3R(BO3)2 compounds.
In addition, the SCXRD experiments have been provided for the Na3Gd(BO3)2 sample at 27, 400, and 800 °C in air atmosphere. At 27 and 400 °C, the single crystal did not undergo any changes, whereas at 800 °C, its quality deteriorated significantly and some peaks of a probably additional phase appear (Fig. S3†). The temperature further increases up to 960 °C (above the expected phase transition according to DSC data) led to the partial melting and loss of the initial phase and formation of the polycrystalline phase, which cannot be identified using the SCXRD data only. Though the quality of the obtained data was not good enough, it was possible to simulate the powder diffraction pattern and check the phase composition. According to these data, at 800 °C, the initial phase Na3Gd(BO3)2 coexists with the phase isostructural to Na2.67Tb2.11(B3O9), which crystallizes in the space group Amm2.46 Thus, the new phase corresponds to another Na–Gd borate compound Na3Gd2(BO3)3.
The Nd-containing sample was studied under heating (up to 1040 °C) using powder X-ray diffraction. According to the obtained results, Na3Nd(BO3)2 with the P21/c symmetry is stable up to 820 °C, when some additional peaks appear, but their number and intensities do not allow to definitely identify the additional phase. The situation is changed at 980 °C, when the intensities of additional peaks increase. Thus, in the temperature range from 980 to 1040 °C, Na3Nd(BO3)2 coexists with the phase isostructural to Na2.67Tb2.11(BO3)3 as it has been already shown for Gd-containing compounds. It is important to note that after 980 °C, some extra peaks appeared (marked by * on Fig. S4†). They are likely to be associated with the high-temperature modification of Na3Nd(BO3)2. Unfortunately, this phase cannot persist at room temperature; thus, we cannot describe its crystal structure. Actually, the same behavior was shown for the NaSrY(BO3)2 phase transition in our recent work.20 The amount of the Na3Nd2(BO3)3 phase increases with the temperature from ∼15 (at 980 °C) to ∼40 vol% (at 1040 °C). The phase composition of this sample at room temperature after cooling can be also described by the coexistence of two phases mentioned above with the 2:1 ratio, where 2 corresponds to the initial Na3Nd(BO3)2 phase. It should be noted that the HT-PXRD data are in a very good agreement with DSC data, i.e., according to both the methods, the phase transformation of the Na3Nd(BO3)2 sample occurs at 980 °C.
Thus, the behavior of the studied compounds during heating can be interpreted as follows.
The Na3R(BO3)2 phase (for R at least equal to Nd, Gd) at heating undergoes gradual decomposition to Na3R2(BO3)3. It should be noted that this process begins before the phase transition with low intensity. After the phase transition, the transformation process accelerates dramatically, which is probably due to the less stable structure of the high-temperature phase. In the atmosphere with oxygen/water in the system, the Na3R2(BO3)3 phase passes to oxoborate. It is assumed that the melting effect temperatures obtained from the DSC data reflect the melting of the mixture Na3R(BO3)2 + Na3R2(BO3)3, i.e., the real melting temperature of Na3R(BO3)2 should be apparently at a higher temperature.
The temperature dependencies of the unit-cell parameters of Na3Nd(BO3)2, obtained during the HT-PXRD experiment, are shown in Fig. 3. The changes in the unit cell parameters are relatively linear in the temperature range from 30 to 1000 °C, whereas at the last two temperature points, the unit cell parameters of the initial phase are changed significantly due to the decomposition of this sample. Thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) calculated with the linear approximation of temperature dependencies of the unit-cell parameters are as follows (×10−6 °C−1): α11 = 7.7(1), α22 = 23.5(3), α33 = 31.4(1), μ(α33^c) = 16.6(2) αa = 9.68(5), αb = 23.5(3), αc = 29.4(1), αβ = 0.1(2), αV = 62.5(3). The thermal expansion of Na3Nd(BO3)2 has quite an anisotropic character: αmax/αmin = 4.1. The maximum and minimum expansion were observed practically along the c and a axis, respectively (Fig. 3 and 4), i.e., they are located in the monoclinic plane. Using the coefficients of approximation, the components of the thermal expansion tensor (Table S1†) were determined.
 Fig. 3  The dependence of the unit-cell parameters of Na3Nd(BO3)2 on temperature. The white and grey symbols display the data on heating and after cooling, respectively. The errors are smaller than the symbols. Black circles are probably related to decomposition. 
 Fig. 4  Crystal structure of Na3Nd(BO3)2 in the a) ac and b) bc projections with the section of thermal deformations. BO3 triangles are given in green, Na and Nd atoms are presented as purple and blue spheres, respectively. 
The volume thermal expansion is relatively high (αV = 62.5(3) × 10−6 °C−1) compared with pure sodium borates (〈αV〉 = 50 × 10−6 °C−1) and is closer to hydrated sodium borates.47 According to the traditional principles of the high-temperature behavior of borates, their maximal thermal expansion is perpendicular to the plane of the BO3 triangle,48 while the BO3 triangles themselves are considered as rigid units. Though the crystal structure of Na3Nd(BO3)2 contains two independent sites occupied by boron, i.e., there are two different BO3 triangles, which are almost perpendicular to each other, the anisotropy of thermal expansion cannot be explained by the existence of BO3 triangles only.
Optical properties
The DRS of Na3Gd1−xRx(BO3)2 (R = Pr, Nd, Sm) are plotted in Fig. 4. All the spectra show an absorption band at 273 nm, which is characteristic of Gd3+ transition from the 8S7/2 ground level to the 6IJ excited state (J = 7/2–17/2).49,50 Another band corresponding to the Gd3+ absorption transition 8S7/2 → 6PJ (J = 3/2, 5/2, 7/2) appears in the range of 300–315 nm49,50 and can be clearly seen in the spectra of the samples with R = Nd, Sm.
The absorption spectra of the doped Pr3+ samples are presented in Fig. 5(a). The absorption peaks in the visible region are characteristic of praseodymium transitions from 3H4 ground level to 3P2 (∼445 nm), 3P1 + 1I6 (∼472 nm), 3P0 (∼485 nm), and 1D2 (570–615 nm).51–53
 Fig. 5  Absorption spectra of the crystal with the general formula Na3Gd1−xRx(BO3)2 a) R = Pr, b) R = Nd, c) R = Sm. 
As seen in Fig. 5(b), the Nd3+-doped samples demonstrate typical absorption bands of Nd3+. The observed peaks are associated with well-known electron transitions from the ground state of 4fn to several excited levels for Nd3+; in more detail: 4I9/2 → 2L15/2 (∼331 nm), 4I9/2 → 4D1/2, 4D5/2, 4D3/2 (345–366 nm), 4I9/2 → 2P1/2 (432 nm), 4I9/2 → 4G11/2, 2G9/2, 2D3/2, 2K15/2 (450–488 nm), 4I9/2 → 4G7/2, 4G9/2, 2K13/2 (496–541 nm), 4I9/2 → 4G5/2, 2G7/2 (562–615 nm), 4I9/2 → 2H11/2 (∼626 nm), 4I9/2 → 4F9/2 (683 nm), 4I9/2 → 4F7/2, 4S3/2 (∼750 nm), 4I9/2 → 4F5/2, 2H9/2 (805 nm), and 4I9/2 → 4F3/2 (875 nm).54–60

Fig. 5(c) shows the absorption spectra of the samples with Sm3+. The absorption peaks are located at 346 nm (6H5/2 → 4K17/2), 363 nm (6H5/2 → 4H7/2), 377 nm (6H5/2 → 6P7/2), 391 nm (6H5/2 → 6L15/2), 405 nm (6H5/2 → 4F7/2), 418 nm (6H5/2 → 6P5/2), 439 nm (6H5/2 → 4G9/2), 465 nm (6H5/2 → 4I15/2), and 478 nm (6H5/2 → 4I11/2), which are typical for Sm3+-doped crystals.12 The strongest peak corresponds to 6H5/2 → 4F7/2 electron transition at 405 nm.
Generally, the absorption intensity of the corresponding peaks increases with doping, which, along with a change in the unit cell parameters, proves their incorporation into the crystal structure.
The normalized emission spectra of the samples doped with praseodymium, neodymium, and samarium are showed on Fig. 6(a)–(c), respectively.
 Fig. 6  Normalized emission spectra of the crystals with the general formula Na3Gd1−xRx(BO3)2 a) R = Pr, b) R = Nd, c) R = Sm. 
Normalized PL spectra (Fig. 6(a)) show the presence of the characteristic peaks of Pr3+ ions. There is one peak associated with the transition from the 1D2 excited state to the 3H4 ground state at 607 nm.61–64 Other peaks, corresponding to the transitions from 3P0, are also observed: 3P0 → 3H5, 3H6, 3F2, 3F3, 3F4 at 540, ∼618, 657, ∼720, and 739 nm, respectively.61,62,65 The attribution of the strongest luminescence peaks and their corresponding electron transitions are related to the praseodymium concentration: both 1D2 → 3H4 (607 nm) and 3P0 → 3H5 (∼618 nm) transitions have a dependence on the praseodymium concentration in the crystal. However, the 1D2 energy level of Pr3+ is more sensitive to Pr3+ concentration than 3P0 one;66–69 thus, for x < 0.1 the maximum intensity is associated with the 1D2 → 3H4 transition at 607 nm, for x = 0.1, the band corresponding to 3P0 → 3H6 transition has the maximum intensity, and for x ≥ 0.2, the peak at 657 nm, related to 3P0 → 3F2 transition, becomes the strongest luminescence peak.
The spectra in Fig. 6(a) are normalized to the intensity of the peak at 607 nm; thus, the band at 657 nm seems to increase when the concentration of praseodymium also increases. However, the intensity at 657 nm almost does not change at various concentrations, as seen in Fig. 7, where the original PL spectra are presented without any normalization.

Fig. 6(b) shows the normalized florescence spectrum of Na3Gd1−xNdx(BO3)2 under the 785 nm CW diode laser excitation. Two characteristic Nd3+ luminescence bands were observed in the IR spectral region. The first one is wide (865–925 nm) with a maximum at 875 nm and corresponds to the 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 transition. The second one is located at ∼1057 nm and associated with the 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 transition.60,70–72 Moreover, for different Nd3+ concentrations, no peak shift is observed; however, there is a little change in the luminescence band profile.
It should be noted that the Nd3+ band intensity for 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 transition is much higher than those for 4F3/2 → 4I11/2, most likely due to the lack of spectral sensitivity correction in the inVia Raman spectrometer.
The normalized PL spectra of Na3Gd1−xSmx(BO3)2 crystals (Fig. 6(c)) have several typical peaks located at 571 nm, ∼608 nm, and 654 nm, which correspond to 4G5/2 → 6HJ (J = 5/2, 7/2, 9/2, and 11/2) electron transitions, respectively.73–75
The dependence of fluorescence intensity on R concentration in the crystals with the general formula Na3Gd1−xRx(BO3)2 (R = Pr, Nd, Sm) is shown in Fig. 8. For all the series, luminescence concentration quenching was achieved. For Nd series, the luminescence intensity has a maximal value when x = 0.1, which corresponds to the chemical composition of Na3Gd0.9Nd0.1(BO3)2. A further increase in the x value to 0.2 decreases the luminescence intensity two-fold. For Pr series, the concentration quenching is observed at a lower concentration; the maximum of the luminescence intensity is at x = 0.01, which is 10 times lower than that for the Nd series. The maximum of luminescence intensity for Sm series is also achieved at x = 0.01. However, a sharp decrease is observed for the higher concentration than for Pr series: when the x value increases from 0.05 to 0.1, the intensity decreases in more than 10 times, whereas the increasing x value from 0.01 to 0.05 results in a 20% reduction of the intensity. The quenching process in Na3Gd1−xNdx(BO3)2 is probably a phonon-assisted cross relaxation76 or by the re-absorption process and radiation trapping due to the overlap between the absorption and emission bands.60 For Na3Gd1−xPrx(BO3)2, it is common that increasing the Pr concentration leads to quenching as a result of the cross-relaxation process.69,77,78 The quenching in Na3Gd1−xSmx(BO3)2 is due to the non-radiative energy transfer from excited Sm3+ ion to non-excited Sm3+ ions or opening of cross-relaxation channels.69,77,78

Second harmonic generation
It should be noted that intense second harmonic generation in centrosymmetric crystals is known and typically associated with structural defects as vacancies, distortion of the structure,79–82 or twins.83Fig. 9 shows the features of the nonlinear properties of the crystals with the general formula Na3R(BO3)2 (R = Gd, Pr) and KDP crystals using Kurtz–Perry powder test for the conversion efficiency of Nd:YAG laser radiation into the second harmonic.
 Fig. 9  SHG intensity vs. (a) pump intensity for fraction 125–140 μm and (b) particle size for pumping power density of 50 MW cm−2. 
SHG intensities versus pump power density for the powder fraction 125–140 μm are shown in Fig. 9(a). Both Na3R(BO3)2 as well as KDP demonstrate typical characteristic quadratic dependence of the SHG efficiency on the pump power density but with different curve shapes. Furthermore, they both have nonlinear effective coefficients lower than that for KDP (SHG intensity relative to KDP at pump density of 50 MW cm−2 was measured to be 0.52 and 0.38 for R = Gd and Pr, respectively). The SHG intensities for different fractions under pump power density of 50 MW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 9(b). The obtained data confirm that phase matching is achieved in the studied crystals since the efficiency of SHG for all the samples increased with the increasing particle size.84 The effective nonlinear coefficients (deff) can be approximately estimated as 0.72 and 0.62 of deff (KDP) for Na3Gd(BO3)2 and Na3Pr(BO3)2, respectively, according to the formula .85–87 It should be noted that no laser-induced damage was observed.
Experimental part
Na3R(BO3)2 (R = La–Gd) crystals 30 × 30 × 10 mm3 in size with a transparent area of 5 × 5 × 5 mm3 were grown from the Na2O–B2O3–NaF flux (Fig. 10). Briefly, a Pt crucible containing Na3R(BO3)2, Na2CO3, H3BO3, and NaF was heated to 900 °C. The charge was held in a melted state for a day to achieve full homogenization. After that, the temperature was decreased to 800 °C and then slowly cooled at the rate of 2 °C per day in the range from 800 °C to 770 °C, followed by faster cooling to room temperature. The crystals were extracted from the crucible, and high-quality crystals were chosen for X-ray analysis.

The chemical compositions were measured by EDS SEM using MIRA 3LMU (TESCAN, Czech Republic) in shared research facilities for multielemental and isotope study of SB RAS. Only Na/R relation was taken into account, with an approximate accuracy of 0.3 wt%.
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis of Na3R(BO3)2, where R = Pr(I) and Gd(II), were collected at room temperature using a Rigaku XtaLAB Synergy-S diffraction diffractometer with monochromatized radiation MoKα (λ = 0.71073 Å) and a Hybrid Pixel Array detector in the ω-scanning mode. A semi-empirical absorption correction based on the intensities of equivalent reflections was applied, and the data were adjusted for Lorentz effects, polarization, and background using CrysAlis software.88 The refinement of the unit cell parameters was also performed using the CrysAlis software.88 The definition and refinement of the structure were carried out using the Jana 2006 software package.89 The illustrations were created using the Jana 2006 software package in combination with the DIAMOND program.90 The atomic scattering coefficients for neutral atoms, together with corrections for anomalous dispersion, were taken from International Tables of Crystallography.91 The following monoclinic unit-cell parameters have been obtained: a = 6.6336(1) Å, b = 8.8279(1) Å, c = 10.2569(2) Å, β = 90.939(1)°, V = 600.57(2) Å3 for I and a = 6.5247(1) Å, b = 8.7309(1) Å, c = 10.1447(1) Å, β = 90.866(1)°, V = 577.84(1) Å3 for II. In accordance with the analysis of systematic absence of reflections, the space group was determined to be P21/n. The studied crystals exhibit a slight twining realized in the presence of several additional reflections violating the absence conditions. However, introducing the twinning law and its refinement indicate that the volume of the twin component is less than 1%. The experimental details of the data collection and refinement results are listed in Table 3. The final refinement cycles were converged with R1 = 0.0216, wR1 (all) = 0.0342, GOF = 1.25 for 671 I > 3σ(I). The deepest minimum and highest peaks in the final residual electron density map were 0.70 e Å−3 and −0.85 e Å−3. The final atomic coordinates and displacement parameters are given in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI† materials), respectively.

Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the polycrystalline samples of mixtures Na3Gd1−x(BO3)2:xPr3+/Nd3+/Sm3+ (Fig. S5†) and Na3R(BO3)2 (R = La–Gd) crystals grown from melt–solution (Fig. S6†) were obtained with a Shimadzu XRD 7000 Bragg–Brentano diffractometer using CuKα radiation. The unit cell parameters of Na3R(BO3)2 (R = La–Gd) samples were refined by the Rietveld method92,93 within the GSAS-II program.92 Single crystal data were used as starting models for the refinements with the replacement of REE ion in the corresponding R site of the crystal structure.
The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves for compounds with the general formula Na3R(BO3)2 (R = La–Gd) were measured with the scanning thermal analyzer 449 F5 Jupiter (Netzsch, Germany) in Shared research facilities for multielemental and isotope study of the SB RAS under state assignment of IGM SB RAS. 50 mg powdered Na3R(BO3)2 (R = La–Gd) sample were heated in a platinum crucible with nitrogen as a shield gas from the room temperature to 1300 °C at the rate of 10 °C min−1. An empty Pt crucible was used as the standard.
The high-temperature single crystal X-ray diffraction (HT-SCXRD) experiment has been performed using Rigaku XtaLAB Synergy-S diffractometer (same device used for SCXRD study under ambient conditions) equipped with an HyPix-6000HE detector with a unique high-temperature FMB Oxford system (Oxford, UK). Sample heating was done using a gas blower up to 960 (±10) °C. For this experiment, two single crystals of Na3Gd(BO3)2 with an approximate size of 30 × 30 × 10 μm were selected. Each of them was mounted on the quartz glass fiber, which was placed into a quartz capillary. The obtained single crystal data at 27 and 400 °C were integrated and corrected for background, Lorentz, and polarization effects. An empirical absorption correction based on the spherical harmonics implemented in the SCALE3 ABSPACK algorithm was applied in the CrysAlisPro program. The unit-cell parameters were refined using the least-square techniques. The SHELXL program package94 was used for structural calculations. The experimental details of the data collection and refinement results are listed in Table S4.† The final atomic coordinates and displacement parameters are given in Tables S5 (ESI† materials), respectively (CCDC No. 2238082).
The high-temperature behavior of Na3R(BO3)2 was additionally studied by powder X-ray diffraction for the Nd-containing phase. The high-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (HT-PXRD) measurements have been performed using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer (CuKα radiation, 40 kV/30 mA, Bragg–Brentano geometry, PSD D-Tex Ultra) with a thermo-attachment in the range 30–1040 °C with temperature steps of 50 °C from 30 to 700 °C and with a step of 20 °C from 700 to 1040 °C. The fine-powdered sample was deposited on a platinum sample holder (20 × 12 × 1.5 mm) from an ethanol suspension.95 An external Si standard was used before the measurements to control 2θ correction. The calculations of the unit-cell parameters were performed using the program package Topas 4.2,96 whereas the visualization and calculation of the thermal-expansion parameters tensor were performed using the TTT program package.97 The temperature dependence of the unit-cell parameters was described by linear functions.
The diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of powdered Na3Gd1−xRx(BO3)2 (R = Pr, Nd, Sm) were recorded at room temperature using a Cary 100 spectrophotometer (Varian, Australia) with a diffuse reflectance accessory in the range of 190–900 nm. The DRS data are presented in terms of Abs (A = log(R−1)).
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of Na3Gd1−xRx(BO3)2 (R = Pr, Sm) samples were recorded using a CM2203 spectrofluorimeter (CJSC “SOLAR”, Belarus). The luminescence spectra of powdered Na3Gd1−xNdx(BO3)2 were collected using an inVia Raman microscope under 785 nm CW diode laser excitation in the range of 800–1100 nm.
The second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency of the grown crystals was evaluated in comparison with the KDP crystal using the standard Kurtz–Perry powder technique.84 The crystals were grinded and then powders were graded using standard sieves to the desired range of particle sizes of 20–40, 40–56, 56–64, 64–80, 80–100, 100–125, 125–140, and 140–200 μm. Samples were illuminated by nanosecond pulses of the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (LS-2132UTF, LOTIS TII, Belarus) at the fundamental wavelength λ = 1064 nm with a pulse width of τ = 7 ns and pump power densities in the 5–90 MW cm−2 range. The SHG intensity was measured by a DET100A (Thorlabs, USA) Si diode located behind a series of filters removing the fundamental beam. In addition, the optical breakdown thresholds were investigated.
Conclusion
The single crystals of alkaline rare-earth borates with the general formula Na3R(BO3)3 (R = La–Gd) were grown with modified flux. The composition Na2O–B2O3–NaF provide high quality crystals with transparent apertures about 5 × 5 mm2. According to single crystal XRD and Rietveld refinement of Na3R(BO3)3 (R = La–Gd), these borates crystallize in the centrosymmetric space group P21/n. DSC measurements showed that these compounds melt congruently in the temperature range of 1070 °C (La)–1100 °C (Gd) and exhibit phase transitions in the range of 980 °C (La)–950 °C (Gd).
A series of Pr3+, Nd3+, or Sm3+-doped Na3Gd(BO3)2 (NGB) crystals has a typical luminescence spectra with relative intensity reaching maximum at 1 mol% for Pr3+, Sm3+, and 10 mol% for Nd3+ doping. Using Kurtz–Perry powder test, the effective nonlinear coefficients (deff) can be approximately estimated as 0.72 and 0.62 of deff (KDP) for Na3Gd(BO3)2 and Na3Pr(BO3)2, respectively. Presumably, the nonlinear properties in Na3R(BO3)3 (R = La–Gd) are associated with the structural defects related caused by the phase transitions in these compounds.
