    , Accepted 29th September 2020First published on 20th October 2020AbstractHerein, a conversion-type electrochemical artificial synapse (ECAS) that integrates a solid-state polymer electrolyte with a nanostructured particle film is first designed and fabricated. The device emulates important synaptic functions, which can be adjusted by changing the amplitude, frequency, duration, and number of presynaptic spikes. The ECAS exhibits a dendritic integration that can be used to emulate biological networks. Moreover, the device exhibits the most sensitive impulse response (3 mV) and a competitive power consumption (32 fW), which are magnitudes lower than those of a biological synapse. This new ECAS design strategy and high-performance device pave the way for future low-power and ultrasensitive brain-inspired electronics.
Introduction
Numerous interconnected neurons form the nervous system that can cope with a variety of complex external problems. This biological architecture has inspired the neuromorphic engineering system for robotics and prosthetics.1–4 The biological synaptic cleft is the basic unit that connects presynaptic neurons to postsynaptic neurons. Information transfer between the pre- and postsynaptic membranes is achieved by the release and diffusion of chemical signals. The consequent series of various ion migrations caused by action potentials is the basis of biological learning and memory formation.
Artificial synaptic devices that exploit electrochemical and electric-double-layer behavior, as a result of ion transport, have shown behaviors that could emulate biological neuronal functions.5–7 The reversibility of the pseudocapacitive behavior may be conducive to the bidirectional regulation of the synaptic weight, making it possible to quickly store and erase information in the bioinspired sensorimotor nervetronics. The two-terminal synapses in the vertical structure have the potential to achieve bidirectional ion transmissions.8 Moreover, such devices require high sensitivity and ultra-low power consumption.9–11
Solid polymer electrolytes and nanostructured oxides with better ionic conductivity are widely used in energy storage devices.12–17 High-quality oxide films have been developed to improve the electronic conductivity of the electron/hole transport layer of perovskite solar cells.18–20 Furthermore, the internal electric field, formed by charging, forces ions to quickly return to their equilibrium positions in ion-transferred junction devices, exhibiting poor memory behavior. Inspired by the electrochemical doping of lithium ions (Li+) in metal oxides, conversion-type electrochemical artificial synapses (ECASs) have been proposed for the regulation of synaptic weights.21 The attractiveness of a conversion-type oxide as a lithium storage anode lies in its easy abundant availability.22 In addition, the ultra-sensitive response and suitable frequency range of ion migration devices are more competent for interactive systems.23,24
Herein, an ECAS integrated into a lithium-based solid polymer electrolyte (LSPE) layer with a nickel oxide nanoparticle (NONP) film is used to emulate essential synaptic functions such as excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic current (EPSC and IPSC), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), multiple spike-dependent plasticity, memory enhancement, and dendritic integration. Reversible ion migration provides dynamic regulation of bidirectional synaptic weight in the charging/discharging process. Moreover, ECAS has stable synaptic connections under mV-level pulses, thereby demonstrating excellent sensitivity of the presynaptic spike and energy efficiency due to the nano-scale oxide film.
Results and discussion
ECAS with a simple top electrode/LSPE/NONP/bottom electrode structure was fabricated to imitate the bio-synaptic configuration (Fig. 1). In the nervous system, multiple ion channels are opened successively when an action potential reaches the presynaptic membrane.25,26 Following the biological process, spikes are applied to the synaptic device to trigger the migration of Li+. In ECAS, the Au top electrode and LSPE jointly serve as a presynaptic membrane under positive pulses; ion migration at the interface between LSPE and NONP mimics the release of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft; and electrochemical conversion doping in the NONP film emulates the influx of sodium ions into the postsynaptic membrane.

A high-quality NONP film was obtained from nickel nitride precursors by solution processing; the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis exhibits strong diffraction peaks at 37.5° and 65.5°, which correspond to the (111) and (220) planes of the cubic phase (PDF #47-1049) (Fig. 2a).20,27 The high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis detected a Ni 2p3/2 spectrum that can be separated into three distinct peaks (Fig. 2b) at binding energies of 853.8, 855.5, and 861.1 eV, which correspond, respectively, to Ni2+, vacancy-induced Ni3+ ions, and a shake-up process.20 A nonstoichiometric NONP film has good conductivity compared to that of pure nickel oxide.27,28 The O 1s peaks at 529.7 and 531.6 eV correspond, respectively, to the octahedral bonding of Ni–O, and to nickel hydroxides that include defective nickel oxides with adsorbed hydroxyl groups (Fig. 2c).20 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 2d) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) demonstrated that the NONP film was flat (Fig. 2h). The LSPE surface had a distinct gully morphology (Fig. 2e and i), which is typical of this film. SEM cross-sectional images showed that NONP and electrolyte films were, respectively, ∼100 nm and ∼5 μm thick (Fig. 2f). The gold electrodes sit on the electrolyte membrane in an array (Fig. 2g). The distance between the centers of adjacent gold electrodes is about 1300 μm, which meets the requirements of dendritic integration.

Synaptic plasticity is a change in the efficiency of transmission of information between neurons and is the basis of information storage in the brain.29,30 To emulate the synaptic plasticity in ECAS, top electrodes are considered as the presynaptic membrane for spike inputs and information reception, and the bottom electrodes are considered as the postsynaptic membrane for current outputs. Initially, the application of a forward pulse to the top electrode can drive the migration of Li+ in the electrolyte to the interface. Continuous large positive spike stimulation increases the number of Li+ that are implanted in the NONP layer, so electrochemical doping occurs (Fig. 3a). Conversely, the behavior of the electric double layer formed at the interface under negative spike dominates. Large external spike cause large numbers of Li+ and NONP to undergo electrochemical conversion reactions that result in the storage of Li+; the memory transformation of artificial synaptic devices is improved from seconds to tens of seconds. This conversion reaction can be generally expressed as NiO + 2Li  Ni + Li2O.31,32 After continuous spike stimulation, Li+ ions reduce oxides to form Li2O and metallic nickel. The formation of phase, Ni0 and Li2O are also expected to be observed. Consequently, XPS was used to analyze the composition of the NONP films at different depths (Fig. S1, ESI†) after implantation of Li+ and confirmed the occurrence of the conversion electrochemical reaction. The film showed a large number of Ni2+ at a depth of 100 nm; the spectrum also showed a weak shoulder peak at ∼852.0 eV, which represents Ni0 (Fig. S1a, ESI†).33 A small amount of Li2O remained on the surface, which implies that the electrochemical doping process occurs during continuous charging (Fig. S1b, ESI†).

(h) Transformation of the electric double layer to conversion-type doping under continuous external presynaptic spikes. (i) Postsynaptic currents triggered by 200 positive presynaptic spikes. 
Current–voltage (I–V) sweeps of ECAS were conducted to evaluate the stability of the postsynaptic current. The initial and terminal current of the device and testing interval and duration were recorded after each sweep (Fig. 3b). As the interval Δt between two adjacent sweeps increases, the initial current ratio of the previous to the next I–V curve (i.e., Ipost/Ipre × 100%) tends to 100% (Fig. 3c). This result implies that the device is stable, which is the basis for synaptic weights to be adjustable at different amplitudes. Li+ pre-doping induced by interface diffusion or migration triggered by I–V sweeps illustrates the reversibility of synaptic activity and shows the bidirectional plasticity of ECAS. A pair of bumps (negative differential resistance) in the I–V curve were observed after a large number of spike stimulations, which is considered as electrochemical doping (Fig. S1c, ESI†). An increased EPSC triggered using a single positive spike demonstrated that Li+ migrates under the action of an external electric field (Fig. 3d). When the presynaptic spike is removed, the Li+ return to an equilibrium position and the response current decays to its initial state. Artificial synapses undergo a process of electrolyte polarization/depolarization or even electrochemical doping/dedoping.34,35 The current gain produced by applying two consecutive negative spikes is significantly increased; this change indicates that paired-pulse stimulation causes a gain-accumulation effect (Fig. 3d). Reverse current often occurs in ionic artificial synaptic devices, which is related to the migration of ions in the electrolyte and the direction of the applied electric field. As interval Δt was increased from 20 to 178 ms, the gain accumulation effect weakened (Fig. 3e and Fig. S2, ESI†). The effect of facilitation increased with an increase in the number of spikes; thus a memory enhancement was achieved.
The multistore memory model indicates that a sustained number of stimuli can enhance memory.36,37 The pulse-triggered current peak is attenuated to the initial level as the memory time ΔT increases. In the device, the memory retention under a single pulse ΔT1 was ∼3.5 s. As the number of pulses N increased, the memory retention under several pulses ΔTN increased (Fig. 3f). The memory strength SM after different spike numbers N (SM = ΔTN/ΔT1 × 100%) can be significantly increased under repeated stimulation (Fig. 3g). As N increases, SM increases, under both positive (Fig. S3, ESI†) and negative pulses (Fig. 3f). The differences in the response of SM to positive and negative inputs may be attributed to the occurrence of the conversion-type electrochemical reaction process, i.e., more Li+ can migrate from the electrolyte to the oxide.38 Thus, the NONP as the postsynaptic membrane is reduced by Li+ and a conversion reaction occurs (Fig. 3h). With 200 consecutive inputs (+6 V), the decay time can reach more than 60 s, which suggests that more Li+ can migrate through the electrolyte under the influence of possible interface diffusion (Fig. 3i).38,39
Multiple plasticity was emulated at various voltages to illustrate the correlations between the input signals and the output signals in an artificial synapse (Fig. 4a). Action potentials with different frequencies contain important information for neural information coding. Therefore, the observation of this spike-rate-dependent plasticity (SRDP) is very necessary. Biological synapses can filter different frequency signals according to their own connection effects (facilitation and depression).26,40–42 When 10 pulses of different frequencies are used as input signals, the strengthening of synaptic connections increased as the pulse frequency increased (Fig. 4b). Short-term synaptic strengthening facilitates the extraction of high-frequency band signals. At a given pulse frequency, as the amplitude increased from 3.0 to 4.5 V, the gain of the synaptic connection increased (Fig. S4, ESI†). The trend in amplitude gain (A10/A1 × 100%) at different frequencies is almost identical, so this system could work as a dynamic high-pass filter (Fig. 4c).40,42 Continuously strengthened synaptic connections are selective for high-frequency input signals. High-pass filtering is implemented in the form of SRDP, and the results show that the synaptic output response is only amplified by the input that has high spike frequency (Fig. 4c).

(b) SRDP (−3, −4 V) and (c) SRDP index (A10/A1 × 100%; A1 and A10 are, respectively, postsynaptic currents induced by the first and last pulses at the same frequency) according to spike rate from 1.26 to 0.36 s per spike. (d) SDDP and (e) SDDP index (An/A1 × 100%; n = 1, 2, 3, …, 10; An is postsynaptic current value by the last pulse under the different number) according to spike duration from 0.18 to1.62 s. (f) SNDP and (g) SNDP index (An/A1 × 100%; n = 1, 2, 3, …, 10; An is postsynaptic current value by the last pulse under the different number) according to spike number from 1 to 10. (h) Postsynaptic currents triggered by various pulses for the emulation of several synaptic plasticities. (i) Power consumption comparison for different synaptic behaviors. 
Broadening the pulse duration at different voltages also increased the synaptic strength significantly (Fig. 4d), i.e., spike-duration-dependent plasticity (SDDP). When the pulse duration was increased from 0.4 to ∼1 s (−5 V), the postsynaptic current peak doubled from −40 to ∼−80 nA, which is equivalent to the peak generated by ten consecutive pulse stimulations of −4 V, and 0.4 s per spike. The SDDP index is significantly improved for the −5 V pulse amplitude (Fig. 4e). Pulse inputs of different amplitudes (3.0 to 5.0 V) allow the postsynaptic current to increase gradually after a surge (Fig. S5, ESI†). The plasticity induced by pulse frequency and duration with adjustable synaptic strength under different amplitudes is important in neuromorphic systems (Fig. S6, ESI†).8 This increase in postsynaptic currents also occurred during spike-number-dependent plasticity (SNDP; Fig. 4f and Fig. S7, ESI†). As the pulse amplitude increased, the SNDP index also increased (Fig. 4g). The current surge triggered by a certain number of pulses may represent memorization, and the subsequent current decay may represent forgetting.
The multiple plasticity of artificial synapses can be achieved with millivolt-level pulses; and the device has bidirectional plasticity, extremely low power consumption and excellent sensitivity. To mimic EPSC/IPSC and bidirectional plasticity under millivolt-level pulses in our ECAS, a train of pulses was input at amplitudes of 5 and −2 mV with an interval time of 0.6 s (Fig. S8, ESI†). When the low operating voltage reaches 5 mV, the signal to noise ratio is 4.3 dB. PPF was realized in two directions. The bidirectional plasticity of ECAS facilitates information updating because an opposite pulse input can produce an IPSC that erases stored information. When the opposite pulse continues to be the input, the corresponding information can be stored instead. Bidirectional synaptic plasticity enables the weight to be updated linearly, and this response is beneficial in neural network applications.43–45
Low power consumption was achieved by reducing the reading bias and decreasing the pulse number, frequency, duration, and amplitude while completing emulation of essential plasticity (Fig. S9, ESI†). The peak of the postsynaptic current increased significantly as the number and duration of the pulse increased (Fig. 4h), but decreased significantly as the pulse frequency and amplitude decreased. The postsynaptic current reached ∼16.4 pA at an amplitude of 5 mV, which is highly sensitive and corresponds to the low power consumption of ∼82 fW (Fig. 4i). Power consumption was further reduced to 32 fW by reducing the pulse amplitude to 3 mV (Fig. S10, ESI†). This extremely low-power consumption is competitive, with magnitudes less than 10 pW, which is typical of a biological synapse.46,47 The input pulse in ECAS is also lower than that at the biological level of an action potential.48
The emulation of a dendritic process is a possible technique to realize bioinspired neuromorphic systems.49 Dendrites are important components of neuronal units and can integrate synaptic inputs and output signals to subsequent neurons. Here, an artificial neuron was emulated by coupling two presynaptic inputs with a postsynaptic output signal in ECAS to realize spatiotemporal learning rule and logic operation. To exploit the adjustable weights that can be achieved by a single synaptic device, two input ports (“synapse 1”, “synapse 2”) were used in the array to achieve multi-synapse information integration (Fig. 5a). The postsynaptic current on the axon is regulated by the pulse-time sequence of the anterior dendrites. When synapse 2 was triggered before synapse 1 (Δt < 0), the postsynaptic current (Asynapse1+2) gradually increased as the time interval between the two presynaptic spikes was reduced (Fig. 5c). When two synapses work together, the facilitation index (Asynapse1+2/Asynapse1 × 100%) was significantly higher than the PPF of a single synapse. When two synapses acted simultaneously (Δt = 0), the facilitation index (197%) increased significantly. This relationship between multiple neurons reflects that the weight of synaptic connections depends on pulse timing.

(e) Postsynaptic currents triggered by a pair of presynaptic (excitatory and inhibitory) spikes for emulating shunting inhibition function. 
The cumulative effect of the simultaneous application of presynaptic spikes can achieve logic operations. When the reading voltage was −1.5 V, neither synapse 1 nor 2 was stimulated to break the set threshold (−40 nA, Fig. S11, ESI†), and when the reading voltage was shifted to −0.1 V, both synapse 1 and 2 broke the set threshold (Fig. 5d). Therefore, the reading voltage at the bottom could be controlled to realize information integration and regulation among several synaptic gaps. Interestingly, a behavior that resembled shunting inhibition occurred when the one synapse was excitatory and one was inhibitory. As the inhibitory effect of synapse 1 gradually deepened, the shunting inhibition behavior of synaptic current strengthened (Fig. 5e); this is an important mechanism that regulates neural responses.50
Conclusions
This paper has presented conversion-type electrochemical doping to emulate artificial synaptic plasticity. A synaptic device that combines an electrolyte with nanoparticles achieves anchoring of Li+ under the action of a successive external stimulus, thereby emulating the memory behavior. Imitation of the biological dendritic process achieved spatiotemporal learning rules, logical operations and shunting inhibition of ECAS. Moreover, the device exhibits so far, the most sensitive pulse responsivity and a competitive power efficiency among two-terminal artificial synapses. Electrochemically-doped devices with simple junction structures are expected to be applicable in interactive sensitive sensorimotor systems.
Experimental
Device fabrication
A solution of nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) was prepared by dissolving it in ethylene glycol. To fabricate a NiOx film, 0.1 mL of the solution was spin-cast on a silicon substrate at 4000 rpm for 50 s. The substrate was then post-annealed at 300 °C in ambient air for 60 min. The doped-Si substrate was cleaned by sonication in deionized water, acetone and 2-propanol, then boiled in 2-propanol, and then treated with UV-ozone. NiOx precursor was spin-coated on the substrate and annealed at 300 °C for 60 min in ambient air. LSPE was obtained by mixing LiClO4 and polyethylene oxide (PEO) powders with acetonitrile. After LSPE coating had been delivered, the devices were annealed at 90 °C in a nitrogen-filled glove box for 20 min to eliminate residual moisture before electrical measurements. Top electrodes were thermally deposited through a shadow mask.
Characterization
XRD patterns were obtained using a Rigaku Ultima IV instrument. XPS was conducted using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi instrument. AFM images were obtained using an ARTCAM-130-SIINI microscope. SEM was performed using a Thermo Scientific Apero S field-emission microscope to image the top-view and cross-section morphologies. All electrical measurements were characterized using a Keithley 4200A semiconductor parameter analyzer in a nitrogen-filled glove box with contents of both moisture and oxygen <0.2 ppm.
