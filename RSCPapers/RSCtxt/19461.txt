    , Accepted 8th February 2017First published on 13th February 2017AbstractAlthough upconversion phosphors have been widely used in nanomedicine, laser engineering, bioimaging, and solar cell technology, the upconversion luminescence mechanism of the phosphors has been fiercely debated. A comprehensive understanding of upconversion photophysics has been significantly impeded because the number of photons incorporated in the process in different competitive pathways could not be resolved. Few convincing results to estimate the contribution of each of the two-, three-, and four-photon channels of near-infrared (NIR) energy have been reported in yielding upconverted visible luminescence. In this study, we present the energy upconversion process occurring in NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphors as a function of excitation frequency and power density. We investigated the upconversion mechanism of lanthanide phosphors by comparing UV/VIS one-photon excitation spectra and NIR multi-photon spectra. A detailed analysis of minor transitions in one-photon spectra and luminescence decay enables us to assign electronic origins of individual bands in multi-photon upconversion luminescence and provides characteristic transitions representing the corresponding upconversion channel. Furthermore, we estimated the quantitative contribution of multiple channels with respect to irradiation power and excitation energy.
1. Introduction
Historically, lanthanide phosphors have been widely used for laser amplification1 and in 2D displays or lamps2 owing to their strong emissions in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions. Recently, the upconversion luminescence of lanthanide materials has been widely utilized in nanomedicine,3–7 solid 3D displays,8 nanoscale thermometry,9–11 and solar cell technology.12,13 Nevertheless, the small quantum yield of the upconversion process, which is measured to be less than 3% for the bulk sample,14 must still be overcome.15,16 To ensure the optimal quantum efficiency of upconversion luminescence, a comprehensive understanding of radiative transition, energy transfer, and nonradiative relaxation is required. However, the complexity of competitive two-, three-, and four-photon absorption and complicated energy scaffolds has obscured the complete description of the upconversion pathway.
Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the atomic energy state and the intensity of individual transitions accompanying the upconversion phenomena. The energy levels of various lanthanide ions in lanthanum chloride were investigated by Dieke and coworkers.17 Carnall et al. also elucidated the atomic energy levels of lanthanides split by spin–orbit interaction in various host materials.18 Dominant energy splitting and sublevel splitting occur because of spin–orbit coupling and crystal field splitting, respectively, and configuration mixing becomes significant in energy level splitting of rare earth metals.19,20 Furthermore, Judd and Ofelt proposed a theory for calculating the transition intensity among atomic states perturbed by a crystal field.21,22 The luminescence energies and intensities of lanthanide phosphors can be determined from nonradiative relaxation. Two pathways have been reported to be the predominant relaxation channels of lanthanide-incorporating hosts. First, multiphonon relaxation is a dominant nonradiative energy relaxation channel during upconversion of rare earth metals. Multiphonon relaxation is known to follow the energy gap law23 because of the small value of the Huang–Rhys S parameter,24 and a phonon mode of the highest energy determines the multiphonon relaxation rate.25 Second, cross-relaxation is also a predominant nonradiative decay channel wherein the energy of an electronically excited atom is transferred to the neighboring atom by resonant promotion from the ground state to the excited state.26 Moreover, strong arguments have been presented regarding the individual nonradiative channels in the upconversion pathway.
Recently, the NaYF4 host has been recognized to be the most efficient among various upconversion hosts27 because the dominant phonon modes of NaYF4 are located between 300 and 400 cm−1.28 Current studies on upconversion nanoparticles have led to controversies on the detailed mechanism of energy transfer upconversion incorporated in NaYF4 and other hosts. Independent research groups have reported that disparate upconversion pathways accompany two- or three-photon energy transfer. Berry and co-workers reported that the red (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) emission in NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphors primarily undergoes the three-photon process.29 Lee and co-workers studied the two-photon upconversion process that leads to red emission in NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanoparticles and concluded that the two-photon channel incorporates multiphonon relaxation between energy transfer events.30 In addition, Zhang et al. reported that non-phonon relaxation contributes significantly to the red emission of Y2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphors.31
It is very important to observe the spectral shape changes that occur when changing the experimental conditions from a one-photon process to a multi-photon process because the spectral change is related to photophysics in atoms, molecules, ions and lattices. Despite controversies, Berry and co-workers, who claim the occurrence of a three-photon process, did not explain the reason for the red emission spectrum being observed upon direct excitation (442 nm).28,29 Also, Lee and co-workers, who proposed the two-photon process, did not explain why the spectral shape of major green emission changes from triplet to quartet when the excitation wavelength changes from 488 nm to 980 nm.30 Furthermore, previous research did not show the ratio of two-photon emission to three-photon emission of red upconversion emission.
In this study, we unravel the complicated upconversion pathway of green and red emissions as a function of irradiation power density and observe the critical threshold of power density for multiple upconversion processes. To investigate the explicit pathway of energy transfer and nonradiative relaxation, we conducted a comparative study of a one-photon vs. multi-photon luminescence experiment and a time-resolved luminescence study. In one-photon Stokes-shifted luminescence study, we employed ultraviolet (UV) and visible (VIS) lasers to promote rare earth metals into selected higher energy states and used an NIR laser to provoke upconversion under different irradiation power densities in a multi-photon upconversion experiment. Furthermore, the occurrence of red emission at a low power region without the observation of a three-photon indicator provided the intensity ratio of a three-photon to two-photon pathway.
2. Experimental
One-photon and upconversion luminescence spectra excited at different colors of lasers (405, 488, 532, and 632.8 nm) were obtained using a lab-built luminescence setup equipped with a spectrophotometer (SM245, Korea Spectral Products). Continuous wave lasers were used to generate 405 (LM405-PL3R25, Ondax Inc.), 488 (543-AP-A01, Melles Griot), 532 (SLIM532S-50-COL-PP, Oxxius), 632.8 (HNL210-EC, Thorlabs Inc.), and 980 nm (MDL-III-980-500, CNI laser) excitations. Furthermore, the third harmonics of the nanosecond pulsed Nd:YAG (Surelite I-20, Continuum) and the optical parametric oscillator (basiScan 120, Spectra Physics) pumped by another Nd:YAG laser (Quanta-Ray GCR-150, Spectra Physics) were used to introduce 355 nm and tunable pulses. Luminescence excitation spectra were recorded using FS-2, Scinco in reflection geometry. And the lifetime was measured with lab-built instruments. The light source was optical parametric oscillator (BasiScan 120, Spectra Physics) pumped by Nd:YAG laser (Quanta-Ray GCR-150, Spectra Physics) and the detection system was composed of a monochromator (250IS, Chromex), a photomultipler tube (R925, Hamamatsu) and digital storage oscilloscope (Waverunner LT372, LeCroy).
The upconversion phosphors were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. The details of the sample are as follows: X-ray diffraction (XRD) results of the NaYxYbyErzF4 (x = 0.77 y = 0.20 z = 0.03) green phosphors. The peak positions of these upconversion materials agree with hexagonal NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ crystals (JCPDS file number PDF 16-0334). Also, there was a small portion of XRD cubic phase peak patterns. The particle size was 1–5 micrometers. For reducing experimental noise from scattered light, we transformed the phosphor powder into a pellet using a hydraulic press. The diameter of the full-size pellet was 13 mm.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the photoluminescence spectra of NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphors in the form of a solid tablet irradiated at 355 (black), 405 (red), 488 (green), and 532 nm (blue). In the one-photon experiment, we employed both continuous wave (cw) lasers and nanosecond (ns) pulsed lasers for each excitation except at 355 nm excitation for which we only used the ns laser. In the low-power region, the ns and cw lasers yielded identical spectra for 405, 488, and 532 nm excitation (ESI†). In the figure, we plotted the luminescence spectra of 405, 488, and 532 nm in parallel with that of 355 nm obtained with the ns laser. Moreover, we tuned the excitation energy at various wavelengths other than the four wavelengths shown in the figure. For the sake of clarity, all luminescence spectra are normalized with respect to the highest peak at 541 nm. On the basis of the previous study,17 the doublet band centered at 525 nm, the triplet band at 550 nm, and the doublet band at 660 nm are assigned to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions, respectively (Scheme 1).
 Fig. 1  (a) One-photon luminescence spectra of upconversion phosphor excited with 355, 405, 488, and 532 nm laser. Note that the incident power was maintained at 1 mW (*peak I originated from the second harmonics of incident 355 nm light). (b) Luminescence excitation spectra of phosphors. We recorded the emission intensity of 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (top) and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (bottom) transitions by tuning the excitation lamp from 200 to 540 nm. 
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram of excitation laser energy and upconversion luminescence spectra via two- and three-photon upconversion pathways. 
The UV/VIS luminescence study is advantageous when compared with the NIR study because the energy of an atomic excitation restricts the type of accessible energy scaffolds of Er3+ ions, whereas an NIR laser (980 nm in this experiment) solely promotes the 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transition of Yb3+ ions. Under 980 nm radiation, multiple photons can be sequentially incorporated in the energy transfer process and emission bands corresponding to different energies from 1.5 μm (4I13/2 → 4I15/2) to 410 nm (4H9/2 → 4I15/2) are observed in the luminescence spectra. Consequently, UV/VIS excitation to emissive energy levels simplifies the upconversion models because it prevents the ambiguity originating from multiple photon upconversion.
The emission spectra irradiated with 355 and 405 nm lasers show different spectra than the spectra irradiated at 488 and 532 nm. The triplet structure assigned to the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition after 488 and 532 nm absorption bands appear in a quartet structure. An additional transition at 557 nm shown in the black and red spectra represents that above 24690 cm−1, which corresponds to the energy of 405 nm light. Additional emissive states can be excited; however, they are inaccessible when we apply 488 and 532 nm radiation. This result was confirmed for a wide excitation range using tunable ns pulse laser excitation. We assigned the red-most peak of the quartet structure at 557 nm to the transition from the 2H9/2 state to the second low-lying 4I13/2 state in Scheme 1, according to the Dieke diagram. This transition has been often observed in the spectra of upconversion nanoparticles without assignment.32–34 Henceforth, we recognize the 2H9/2 → 4I13/2 transition as the direct evidence for three- or more-photon absorption considering the energy level of the 2H9/2 state.
Subsequently, we proposed that the time-resolved photophysics of 2H9/2 → 4I13/2 differs from those of 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 transitions. Fig. 2 shows the separate rise-decay profile of three congested green emissions recorded at 525, 545, and 556 nm when pumped with 355 nm photons. The rising time of 2H9/2 → 4I13/2 is drastically shorter than the gently rising 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 transitions, thereby indicating that nonradiative relaxation to the 2H9/2 state is significantly fast. According to energy gap law, a large energy gap among upper states slows down multiphonon relaxation to the 4S3/2 or 2H11/2 state, thereby leading to the gradual increase in the figure.
 Fig. 2  Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphors at 355 nm excitation. Note that the phosphor was excited with nanosecond pulse laser (355 nm), and decay profiles were probed at 4H11/2 → 4I15/2 (525 nm), 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (545 nm), and 2H9/2 → 4I13/2 (556 nm) transitions. 
Other minor transitions are assigned to analyze the upconversion mechanism. The transition at 504 nm, which is only shown upon 355 nm excitation (black), is assigned to 4G11/2 → 4I13/2 transition considering the atomic energy of the erbium trivalent ion. The 4G11/2 scaffold will not be promoted with light energy lower than 379 nm photons by calculation. The peculiar doublet band (697 nm) is assigned to the radiative transition from 2H9/2 to the third low-lying state (2H9/2 → 4I11/2). The absorption of 355 nm or 405 nm photon leads to the excitation of the 2H9/2 state near 410 nm, which requires more than three-photons under 980 nm radiation. Hence, the 2H9/2 → 4I13/2, 2H9/2 → 4I11/2, and 4G11/2 → 4I13/2 transitions can be considered to be evidence for three- or more-photon upconversion processes when 980 nm light is irradiated, and they can be used to clarify the mechanism of the complicated energy upconversion pathway.
We note that the 410 (4H9/2 → 4I15/2), 557 (2H9/2 → 4I13/2), 697 (2H9/2 → 4I11/2), and 504 nm (4G11/2 → 4I13/2) transition bands provide evidence for more than three-photon excitation in Scheme 1. The previous research did not explain the spectral shape variation, which could lead to recognition of a two- or three-photon process, from triplet to quartet when the excitation wavelength changes.28–30
An additional peculiarity of the UV/VIS luminescence spectra shown in Fig. 1(a) is the variation in the intensity of 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition bands appearing at 655 nm. The emission spectra irradiated with the 355 nm and 405 nm lasers exhibit strong and intermediate red emission (4F9/2 → 4I15/2), respectively, the emission spectra irradiated with 488 and 532 nm lasers show weak red emission. The absorption of 632.8 nm laser results in the direct excitation of the 4F9/2 state, thus leading to the high intensity of 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 emission (ESI†). The intensity of red emission indicates that the nonradiative decays from the 4S3/2 to 4F9/2 state are inefficient; however, the decays from the 2H9/2 to 4F9/2 state are relatively efficient. These results indicate that the state-to-state selective relaxation channel, as opposed to nonselective multiphonon relaxation, plays a key role in upconversion red emission, which will be discussed in detail with multi-photon luminescence results.
Furthermore, the luminescence excitation spectra were acquired by tuning the excitation wavelength from 200 to 540 nm using a conventional fluorometer; the results are shown in Fig. 1(b). The upper and lower spectra in the figure are the luminescence excitation spectra probed at red luminescence transition (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) and green luminescence emission (2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2), respectively. The scattered solid circles are the computed red to green emission ratios (R/G ratios) of several major bands when the phosphors were excited in 2H11/2, 4F7/2, 4F5/2, 2H9/2, 4G11/2, 4G9/2, and 4D7/2 states from low to high energy. The R/G ratios for 2H11/2, 4F7/2, and 4F5/2 states are less than 0.1, and the ratio for 2H9/2 is 0.34. Furthermore, the ratios of 4G11/2, 4G9/2, and 4D7/2 states are greater than 2.0. These results are consistent with our suggestion that the excitation to upper states above 2H9/2 leads to specific state-to-state relaxation rather than nonspecific multiphonon relaxation.
The relative intensity of Stokes-shifted luminescence depends on the nonradiative transition rate to the final emissive states, branching ratio, and radiative transition rate from emissive states. The variation of R/G ratios in a one-photon spectra ratio can be attributed to the multiphonon relaxation rate and cross-relaxation. In a solid host, multiphonon relaxation is known to play a crucial role in nonradiative transition and the rate follows the energy gap law according to Moos and Weber.35,36 According to the energy gap law, the multiphonon relaxation rate is determined by the energy difference between adjacent states. The largest energy gap (3117 cm−1 for free ions) between 4S3/2 and the next low-lying state (4F9/2) lowers the multiphonon relaxation rate in the one-photon excitation experiment. The highest phonon energy of NaYF4 is measured to be 300–400 cm−1; therefore, at least eight phonons are required for multiphonon relaxation.37 Subsequently, the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition exhibits weak intensity when compared with the other transitions from the higher energy states.
In NaYF4 phosphors, cross-relaxation is a type of energy transfer occurring between Er3+–Er3+ or Er3+–Yb3+ because they have energetically resonant states. Further, Yb3+ ions have the only 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition in the infrared-visible-ultraviolet region, with energy corresponding to 10214 cm−1. The atomic ratio of phosphors is Y3+:Yb3+:Er3+ = 77:20:3, thus indicating that cross relaxation predominantly occurs from Er3+ to Yb3+. In the energy-level diagram, we can see that 355 and 405 nm excitations of Er3+ lead to transitions to 2G9/2 and 2H9/2 states, respectively. For the 405 nm excitation, the 2H9/2 state and the next low-lying state differ by 2021 cm−1 in energy, which leads to a finite lifetime of the state. Moreover, the computed energy difference between the 2H9/2 and 4F9/2 states from free-ion state data17 is 9292 cm−1, and this value differs from the value of 10214 cm−1 of the Yb3+ ion. However, crystal field splitting induces band broadening at room temperature, and the energy mismatch between 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+ and 2H9/2 → 4F9/2 of Er3+ is significantly reduced.38 Furthermore, phonon assistance leads to cross-relaxation in a slightly nonresonant condition.39 Because 2H9/2 → 4F9/2 (in Er3+) coupled with 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 (Yb3+) cross-relaxation is sufficiently efficient so as to contend with multiphonon relaxation to 4F9/2, the luminescence spectrum shows a noticeable red emission intensity.
For the 355 nm excitation, the promotion to the 2G7/2 state leads to the 2G9/2 state via single phonon relaxation owing to the small energy difference of less than 400 cm−1. The next low-lying state (4G11/2) is 942 cm−1 below the 4G9/2 state, and the energy gap cannot prevent multiphonon relaxation considering crystal field splitting. The computed energy difference between 4G11/2 and 4F9/2 states is 11194 cm−1, and it satisfies the condition for phonon-assisted cross-relaxation. Moreover, multiphonon relaxation to low-lying states contends with cross-relaxation; hence, 2H9/2 → 4F9/2 cross-relaxation accompanies 4G11/2 → 4F9/2 relaxation. Therefore, cross-relaxation results in an increase in the red emission intensity for the 355 nm excitation. The higher R/G ratio at 355 nm in Fig. 1(a) shows that the cross-relaxation from the 4G11/2 to 4F9/2 state is more efficient than 2H9/2 → 4F9/2.
To elucidate the upconversion mechanism under NIR excitation, we obtained the upconversion spectra of NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphors by varying the power density of the 980 nm laser. As shown in Fig. 3, the spectral shape of the upconversion spectrum significantly depends on the power density of incident light because the power density limits the number of photons affecting the rate of energy transfer upconversion (ETU) and excited state absorption (ESA). We investigated the effect of power on upconverted light for upconversion of phosphors in the form of a tablet. In contrast to the single crystalline structure of nanoparticles, the powder comprises a polycrystalline or amorphous structure with enormous defect sites. Because nonradiative relaxation rapidly occurs in the upconversion tablet owing to the high-energy vibrations at defect sites, the upconversion efficiency is expected to be lower than that of nanocrystals. On the contrary, this inefficient upconversion system can be regarded as an adequate model to finely elucidate the power dependence of transitions because it is less sensitive to variations in irradiance power.
 Fig. 3  Multi-photon upconversion luminescence spectra of NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphors. Power dependence for (a) low (0.05–0.30 mW) and (b) high (0.20–2.00 mW) power regions. 
All the peaks in Fig. 3 increase with increasing power density without normalization. We normalized the spectra with respect to the peak height of green emission and classified the power dependent spectra as (a) low- and (b) high-power regions in the figure. We observed the power dependence of upconversion in phosphors from 1 to 40 W cm−2. The total power of the 980 nm laser is shown in the figure, and the power density was calculated (ESI†). The power-dependent spectra in Fig. 3(a) and (b) show that the intensities of minor transition peaks are significantly affected by power density, and the inset of Fig. 3 shows the complete spectra without truncation along the intensity ordinate.
In the inset, the 2H9/2 → 4I13/2 transition is hard to recognize because the band is located at the tail of the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 band. Frequently a three-photon indicator such as 557 nm (2H9/2 → 4I13/2) is difficult to distinguish when the resolution of the spectrometer is poor.32 Therefore, we carefully observe the intensity variation of other three-photon indicators such as 697 nm (2H9/2 → 4I11/2), and 504 nm (4G11/2 → 4I13/2). Fig. 3(a) shows the upconversion luminescence spectra for laser power less than 0.3 mW (6 W cm−2). The two-photon upconversion process occurs solely at this power because the three-photon indicators cannot be seen in the spectra below 0.2 mW irradiation. Therefore, the two-photon process contributes to the red emission in the absence of a three-photon process.

Scheme 1 shows the two possible two-photon upconversion pathways (II-A and II-B). The II-A pathway involves a sequential two-photon excitation and nonradiative relaxation pathway (4I15/2 → 4I11/2 → 4F7/2 → 4F9/2), and the II-B pathway involves first excitation, nonradiative relaxation, and second excitation (4I15/2 → 4I11/2 → 4I13/2 → 4F9/2). Because the 488 and 532 nm excitations, which correspond to two-photon NIR excitation, resulted in weak red emission (4F9/2 → 4I15/2), the efficiency of the II-A channel is remarkably low. In contrast, the major red emissions (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) shown in Fig. 3(a) are stronger than those in the 488 and 532 nm excitation spectra. Therefore, we can conclude that the major photophysical pathway for red emission in the two-photon upconversion process is II-B. The latter channel is plausible considering the strong emission intensity of 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 at 632.8 nm excitation (ESI†). Assuming that the 532 and 488 nm excitations in Fig. 1(a) involve the II-A pathway only, and 980 nm excitation involves both II-A and II-B pathways, we can calculate the relative contribution of II-A and II-B for the 0.10 mW excitation in Fig. 3(a). (II-A:II-B = 26.5%:73.5%) Therefore, we can conclude that in purely two-photon ETU, the II-B channel significantly contributes to red emission.
As the power density increases, the three-photon upconversion channel contributes to the luminescence spectra of phosphors. As can be seen in Fig. 3(b), the intensities of three-photon indicators such as 410, 557, 697, and 504 nm significantly increase. Scheme 1 shows two competing upconversion models (III-A and III-B) with indicator transitions for three-photon excitation. The presence of 410 (4H9/2 → 4I15/2), 557 (2H9/2 → 4I13/2), and 697 nm (2H9/2 → 4I11/2) transitions indicates that both III-A and III-B models participate in the upconversion pathway. Additionally, the 4G11/2 → 4I11/2 transition occurring in the three-photon process obeys the III-B mechanism instead of the III-A mechanism. Because all the three-photon related peaks appear at the same power as the power density increases, the III-A and III-B upconversion processes are presumed to arise from the same power density and compete with each other.
On the basis of one-photon luminescence results, we expect the III-A and III-B processes to become significant because the cross relaxation from the higher excited state is extremely efficient. We conducted the luminescence lifetime study to corroborate our assumption. Fig. 4 shows the decay profile of red emission probed at 650 nm with the phosphors excited at (a) 355, (b) 410, (c) 480, and (d) 520 nm. In this experiment, we selected 410 and 520 nm instead of 405 and 532 nm. We employed 410 nm instead of 405 nm because our OPO system shows poor efficiency below 410 nm, and we selected the 520 nm profile rather than the 532 nm profile because of the luminescence signal intensity. Fig. 4 shows (a) an abrupt increase upon 355 nm irradiation, (b) an intermediate increase (10 μs) at 410 nm, and (c and d) a slow increase (∼30 μs) at 488 and 520 nm. The results indicate that cross relaxation rates correlate with intensities of red emission. After 355 and 410 nm excitation, rapid cross-relaxation induces strong red emission, and slow multiphonon relaxation after 488 nm and 520 nm excitation leads to weak red emission. We also observed an upconversion decay upon 980 nm excitation (ESI†). For both one-photon UV/VIS and multi-photon NIR decay, decay time-constants detected at the same energy are expected to be identical because the emissive states are identical. The rise of each curve varies depending on whether it is a direct excitation or upconversion excitation process, because various processes are involved in the latter. As we expected the decay time-constants of 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition were measured to be similar to the one-photon process.

4. Conclusions
We investigated the energy upconversion process in lanthanide phosphors (NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+) as a function of excitation frequency and power density. First, the number of photons absorbed in two- and three-photon upconversion processes was determined on the basis of the appearance of a peculiar emission peak. Second, various competitive pathways were analyzed using UV/VIS/NIR excitation spectra. Moreover, we estimated the contribution of each channel. Our study will shed light on the multi-photon upconversion mechanism of various types of upconversion phosphors, including nanoparticles, thin films, and solid phosphors. Two- and three-photon NIR upconversion emission can be recognized if the peculiar peaks of three-photon indicator bands such as 410 (4H9/2 → 4I15/2), 557 (2H9/2 → 4I13/2), 697 (2H9/2 → 4I11/2), and 504 nm (4G11/2 → 4I13/2) emissions are observed. As 4f electrons of lanthanides are shielded by 5s and 5p electrons, our conclusion is applicable to NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphors regardless of size, morphology, and crystallinity. The presence of three-photon indicator bands can be used as the clear evidence that the red emission include a two- and three-photon mechanism. In particular, the spectral change from triplet to quartet demonstrates that the three-photon process contributes significantly. Furthermore, upconversion efficiency can be evaluated using the spectral intensity of those indicator bands under identical conditions because the more efficient upconversion host will involve a three-photon process at a lower power.
