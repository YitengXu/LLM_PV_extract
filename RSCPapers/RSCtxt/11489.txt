    , Accepted 11th April 2014First published on 16th April 2014AbstractA quantum dot solar cell (QDSC) was developed using a photoanode with CdS and CdSeS QDs as co-sensitizers, fullerene (C60) clusters as electron conduits and Au nanoparticles capped by poly(acrylic acid) or Au@PAA as plasmons, which were all tethered to TiO2 as the semiconducting scaffold. The formation of CdSeS QDs and hexagon-shaped Au@PAA, each with a face-centered cubic lattice, was confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Evidence for rapid electron injection from CdS or CdSeS to C60 and Au@PAA, as well as for inter-dot electron transfer from CdS to CdSeS, were obtained from fluorescence quenching and emission decay lifetime analyses. The fastest electron deactivation pathway was achieved in the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA electrode, which demonstrated the ability of C60 and Au@PAA to serve as efficient electron sinks due to their high electronic conductivities and their favorably poised Fermi levels. Au@PAA particles induced absorbance increments of CdS and CdSeS QDs, thus indicating that plasmonic improvements could be exploited in the photoanode using the same. High electron transfer rates and plasmonic effects translated into a high overall power conversion efficiency of 3.61% for a QDSC constructed with this composite as the photoanode, aqueous S2− as the electrolyte and carbon-nanotube-based counter electrode. The efficiencies of cells without Au@PAA and C60 were lower by ∼19% and 23%, respectively, confirming the synergy between C60 and Au@PAA in producing larger photocurrents. Aligned conduction bands in the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA electrode that permitted electron transfer by cascade, broader spectral utilization by using CdS and CdSeS and near field plasmonic enhancement by Au@PAA due to its proximity with the QDs, cumulatively manifested in an incident photon to current conversion efficiency of 48%, which is 25% greater than that of the cell without Au@PAA. Our study shows that significant improvements in QDSC performances can be realized by simply developing more efficient designs for photoanode configurations.
1. Introduction
Colloidal quantum dots as light absorbers in photovoltaic devices have witnessed a surge of scientific interest in the past decade.1–3 Quantum dots are solution processable, are significantly cheaper than Ru-based dyes used in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), offer tunable band gaps via control of the dimensions of nanocrystals, and also offer the exciting possibility of generating more than one electron per absorbed photon through a multiple exciton generation phenomenon. These properties render them to be eminently suitable for solar cell applications. Notwithstanding the fact that quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs) exhibit lower efficiencies (2–5%) compared to DSSCs (11–14%),4 there continues to be tremendous scope for improving the efficiencies of QDSCs, especially by using complementary QDs that can lead to a panchromatic absorption of solar radiation. Furthermore, by integrating the quantum dots with intrinsic electron conductors like carbon dots, graphene or fullerene, electron transport is facilitated and electron–hole recombination rates are reduced.5–8 Yet another approach for increasing efficiency involves the blending of plasmonic metal nanoparticles with conventional dye-sensitized electrodes, whereby the light absorption capability of the dye is enhanced due to increased near-field electromagnetic intensity owing to a match between the absorption wavelength of the dye with the localized surface plasmon resonance peak of the nanoparticle.9 Plasmonic increment of DSSC performance was achieved by using Au@SiO2@TiO2 aggregates, in which the average efficiency increased from 2.81% to 5.52%.10 The insulating oxide shell prevents the reduction of the electrolyte species by electrons trapped in Au and also inhibits electrode corrosion by the electrolyte.10 A clear distinction between the plasmonic effect of Au, which can increase photocurrents in a DSSC, and the charge transfer promoting ability of Au, which can increase the open circuit voltage, was made by using Au@SiO2 and Au@TiO2 core/shell particles, respectively.11 In another study, triangular silver nanoprisms coated with silica were loaded onto a photoanode in a DSSC and a 32% ± 17% increment was registered due to plasmonic light trapping effects compared to a non-plasmonic cell, and this was obtained at a 0.05% (w/w) loading of Ag@SiO2.12
Although CdS,13,14 CdSe,15,16 PbS,17 CdTe,18 and PbSe19 have been extensively employed in the past in QDSCs, CdSeS QDs have been relatively less exploited as photosensitizers. Compared to CdSe, CdSeS QDs, owing to the gradient phase, show lesser non-radiative decay, which increases the photoluminescence quantum yield.20 Notably, a study on a gradient alloy of CdSeS, in which three layers of CdSeS with varying band gaps were anchored onto TiO2, successively delivered a maximum PCE of 3%, which was greatly enhanced compared to the PCE values attained for the cells with single band gap CdSeS QDs.20 Heterostructured electrodes of TiO2 nanorods sensitized with nanorods of CdS, CdSe or CdSeS prepared by chemical vapor deposition were assembled into QDSCs, and an incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) (>50%) was obtained in the visible region for CdS- and CdSeS-based systems. Moreover, the authors observed that the TiO2/CdSeS electrode provided a good trade-off between high photocurrent and injection efficiency.21 A cell with an oriented array of TiO2 nanowires sensitized with CdSeS QDs showed an efficiency of 0.6%.22 The limited number of reports on the use of CdSeS QDs in solar cells and the possibility of integrating CdSeS QDs with CdS QDs, which can potentially result in a broader utilization of the solar spectrum and consequently lead to better photovoltaic performance, motivated us to use a combination of two light absorbers: a relatively narrow band gap (2.1 eV) CdSeS QDs and CdS QDs with a wider band gap (2.39 eV). Moreover, C60 molecules were included in our photoanode assembly for improving charge transfer, and a layer of Au nanoparticles coated with an insulating poly(acrylic acid) or PAA shell was applied to tap the plasmonic effects of Au nanoparticles such that these effects could translate to increased photocurrents. Such an assembly wherein the synergy between the components, which manifests in a panchromatic absorption by CdS/CdSeS; fast charge transfer due to C60; and current enhancement induced by Au@PAA plasmons, is a promising solution for harvesting solar energy more efficiently.
Here we present an unreported photoanode architecture of TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA for the realization of high efficiency QDSCs. The energetics, charge transfer and transport mechanisms in this multicomponent assembly were established by fluorescence quenching, decay lifetime and absorption studies. The microstructure of the photoanode and how it affects the photovoltaic response of the ensuing cell was studied by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The roles of C60 and capped Au nanoparticles in increasing the solar cell parameters were defined. The ability of CdS and CdSeS QDs to harness different regions of the visible spectrum and how this impacts the QDSC efficiency favorably was demonstrated. Functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes were used as the counter electrode because they are cheaper and can serve as an equally effective alternate to expensive Pt film electrodes. The high inherent electronic conductivity, a suitably poised work function (4.5 eV for MWCNTs and 5.1 eV for Pt) and the ease of fabrication in the form of a uniform thin film by electrophoresis, further justifies its use as a counter electrode in a QDSC. This strategy of manipulating different cooperative effects between the components of a photoanode offers an exciting cost-effective solution for increasing available photocurrents and designing high efficiency quantum dot solar cells.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Microstructural analyses
The TEM images of Au@PAA nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 1a and Fig. S1 (ESI†). The nanoparticles have quasi-hexagonal shapes, as can be judged from a high magnification inset that exemplifies the hexagonal facets of an Au@PAA nanoparticle. The size of the particles, on average, lies in the range of 35–45 nm. Although the PAA cap is effective for preventing particles from aggregating and for controlling the particle growth/dimensions, there is some coalescence. The slight coalescence is not detrimental because we found that the plasmonic advantage could be tapped using these particles in the photoanode, which eventually translated to higher efficiencies. The HRTEM image of an Au@PAA nanoparticle is shown in Fig. 1b, and from an enlarged view, the fringe spacing was deduced to be 0.236 nm, which matches well with the (111) plane of the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice of Au, in concurrence with PDF: 652870. A low-magnification TEM image, illustrating diffuse particles of a CdSeS QD sol, is shown in Fig. 1c, and the corresponding high resolution image shows lattice fringes from the CdSeS QDs, which have been enclosed in dotted ellipses (Fig. 1d). The magnified views extracted from the CdSeS nanocrystals in the adjoining panels show fringe separations of 0.345, 0.178 and 0.21 nm that concur with (111), (311) and (220) planes. These three interplanar distances are located between those of the fcc lattices of CdSe (PDF: 882346) and CdS (PDF: 652887). These d-spacings are characteristic of CdSe0.75S0.25 with a zinc blende structure, in accordance with the XRD data obtained in an earlier report for alloys of CdSe1−xSx with varying values for x.23 The low and high magnification images of the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA photoanode are shown in Fig. 1e and f. The low magnification image is relatively featureless, and it shows aggregated particles with a fuzzy contrast. The high magnification image shows lattice fringes from TiO2, CdS, CdSe and Au@PAA, and in most of the regions the fringes are overlapping; however, in some portions, distinctive fringes from the individual components could be identified (enclosed within ellipses), and the magnified views of these are shown in the insets and panels adjacent to Fig. 1f. The fringe separation of 0.354 nm matches with the (101) plane of the body-centered tetragonal structure of TiO2 (PDF: 894921), 0.236 nm coincides with the (111) plane of Au with an fcc structure and 0.168 nm arises from the (222) plane of CdS. The fringe separation of 0.3 nm matches with the (200) plane of CdSeS, as this d-value is intermediate to spacings of 0.292 and 0.304 nm of CdS and CdSe, respectively, and 0.18 nm matches with the (311) plane of CdSeS. Moreover, we observed that the lattice fringes from Au@PAA are either conjoined or overlapping with those of CdS or CdSeS (shown in Fig. 1f). This indicates that near field plasmonic enhancement is possible by virtue of the proximity of the photo-absorbers with the Au. Scheme 1 shows the preparation of TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA photoanode.

 Scheme 1  Preparation of TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA electrodes. 
The XRD patterns of CdS and CdSeS QDs are shown in Fig. 2a. The diffractogram of pristine CdS shows prominent peaks at d = 3.34, 2.06 and 1.76 Å, which can be attributed to the (111), (220) and (311) planes of the fcc lattice of CdS (PDF: 652887). The XRD pattern of CdSeS reveals peaks at d = 3.47, 2.12 and 1.81 Å, which are positioned between the d values of CdS and CdSe, thus re-affirming the HRTEM analyses and confirming the formation of CdSeS alloy.23 The XRD pattern of TiO2, affirming its body-centered tetragonal lattice, is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The SEM images of TiO2 and TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA electrodes are shown in Fig. 2. The surface morphology of pristine TiO2 comprises interconnected irregular shaped particles separated by pores (Fig. 2b). Such a granular porous morphology is most conducive for anchoring the photoactive CdS/CdSeS QDs, C60 and Au@PAA nanoparticles. TiO2 (P25 from Evonik) powder has a particle size of about 20 nm, and these particles were dispersed with surfactant and solvent and annealed (iteratively) at 500 °C. The particles tend to aggregate and coarsen upon annealing, as can be seen from the TEM image of a TiO2 film (Fig. 2d). In some regions, grains with distinct boundaries were located, and their sizes were determined to be in excess of 50 nm (about 70–200 nm). Furthermore, solution-processed films (be it QD or the wide band gap semiconductor) tend to be highly porous, and a compact packing of grains is not achieved. This is probably one of the most important factors limiting the performance of QDSCs (as back electron transfer gets facilitated). This is clearly seen in the SEM micrograph of TiO2 film, shown in Fig. 2c. As an illustrative example, the pores in the film have been marked by enclosing them in dotted ellipses. Most of the pore sizes were found to lie in the range of 50–80 nm in the film, which will allow facile permeation of QDs, C60 and Au@PAA nanoparticles for forming the composite electrode. Upon coating the electrode with the QDs, C60 and Au@PAA, the morphology of the resulting electrode appears to be composed of a network of particles (Fig. 2e). The high magnification image of the composite electrode shows the presence of interlinked blob-like particles with pores in between (Fig. 2f). The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of the electrode shows signals from Ti, O, Se, S, Cd and Au, thus confirming the inclusion of CdS, CdSeS and Au@PAA in the TiO2 matrix.

2.2 Absorption, emission and energetics
The absorption spectra of an aqueous PAA/Au colloid and C60 in acetonitrile are shown in Fig. 3a. C60 forms clusters in acetonitrile vis-à-vis intermolecular hydrophobic interactions,24 and the solution showed a sharp peak at 407 nm, corresponding to interband electronic transitions,25 which was followed by a broad absorption profile in the visible region. Similar broad absorption curves in the 400–700 nm wavelength range have been observed for non-aqueous C60 solutions in the past.24,26 The PAA-capped Au nanoparticles showed a symmetric absorption peak at 531 nm, which is characteristic of surface plasmon resonance and has been observed previously in the 520–530 nm range for both citrate- and PAA-stabilized Au colloids.27,28 Pristine CdS QDs deposited on FTO electrode showed a broad but strong featureless absorption in the 400–500 nm wavelength range, which tapers off at 500 nm. In contrast, in a response typical of CdS QDs deposited by successive ionic adsorption and reaction or SILAR,29 the pristine CdSeS QDs showed a distinctive absorption peak in the 500–570 nm range with a λmax at 532 nm (Fig. 3b). The absorption span that can be effectively utilized by the photoanode when a combination of CdS and CdSeS QDs is employed would therefore extend from 400 to 570 nm. The optical band gaps for CdS and CdSeS QDs estimated from the absorption band edges are 2.39 and 2.1 eV. The localized surface plasmonic absorption of Au@PAA NPs with a λmax at 532 nm coincides with the λmax of CdSeS QDs, and therefore when integrated with a photoactive assembly of CdS/CdSeS QDs, the metal nanoparticles are expected to improve the light harvesting capability of photo-absorbers.9 The absorption spectra of FTO electrodes coated with TiO2, TiO2/Au@PAA, TiO2/CdS/CdSeS, TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60 and TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA are shown in Fig. 3c. TiO2 shows a flat absorption profile in the visible region, and the band gap deduced from the absorption edge is 4.16 eV. The TiO2/Au@PAA electrode shows a slightly improved absorption compared to pristine TiO2 in the visible region; however, the plasmonic peak of the Au@PAA is not seen probably because it is swamped by TiO2. In the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS electrode with incorporation of the two photo-absorbers CdS/CdSeS, the overall absorption of TiO2 increased in the visible region. However, upon inclusion of Au@PAA and C60 in the assembly, not only does the overall absorption of the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS assembly increase considerably but also the absorption peak at ∼535 nm (close to the λmax of CdSeS) enhances by 1.6 times compared to TiO2/CdS/CdSeS. This indicates the role of Au@PAA in improving the light absorption capability of the QDs. Even in the weakly absorbing region of 400–500 nm for Au@PAA, the absorption of TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA electrode is higher than that of the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS electrode, again due to the plasmonic effect of Au@PAA, which increases the absorption of CdS QDs. A similar increment in the absorption of N719 dye by inclusion of Au@TiO2 nanoparticles was observed by Choi et al., and this translated into an amplified photocurrent.11 Moreover, we observed that the absorption of the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60 electrode is comparable to that of the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS electrode, especially in the 500–600 nm region. In fact, the absorption shows a strong dip for the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60 electrode at λ > 600 nm. Furthermore, C60 shifts the absorption edge of the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS to higher wavelengths. Note that C60 here serves as an electron acceptor rather than a photoabsorber.

The fluorescence spectra of pristine CdS QDs/glass, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CdS/C60 electrodes are shown in Fig. 4a. The excitation wavelength was fixed at 370 nm, and a broad emission centered at ∼515 nm, corresponding to the band edge emission, was observed. The intensity of this emission was quenched approximately two-fold in the presence of TiO2 and further by 4.5-fold in the presence of both TiO2 and C60. The conduction band edge potentials of TiO2 and CdS were −0.58 and −1.09 V, respectively, (versus a normal hydrogen electrode or NHE). These values were determined from the reduction potentials in the cyclic voltammograms of TiO2 and CdS electrodes (Fig. S3, ESI†). The workfunction of C60 is 0 V (versus NHE). Electron injection from the conduction band of photo-excited CdS to TiO2 or C60 is thermodynamically favorable and is responsible for the fluorescence quenching of CdS. Since the fluorescence spectra of CdS QDs, TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CdS/C60 samples are broad, it is indicative of the presence of more than one peak. These spectra were deconvoluted into two components: a high intensity one at ∼515 nm and a second one at ∼545 nm. The second peak is assigned to the transitions involving the defect states within the gap. Further evidence for the existence of trap states was also obtained in the form of two components for excited electron decay for pristine CdS and related electrodes, wherein the short-lived component was ascribed to the recombination of electrons prevalent in trap states (Fig. 6, Table 1). The ratio of the integrated intensities of the two peaks (I515/I545) was found to vary from 1.38 (CdS) to 1.545 (TiO2/CdS/C60) to 1.77 (TiO2/CdS). Since this ratio was lowest in CdS, it follows that the excited electron de-population from defect states is also the lowest. Pristine CdS, compared to TiO2/CdS or TiO2/CdS/C60, will have a stronger propensity to store charge in the trap states in the absence of an electron acceptor or a wide band gap semiconductor. This has been proved unambiguously by Shalom and co-workers for a CdSe/TiO2-based QDSC.30

From the emission plots of CdSeS QDs/glass, TiO2/CdSeS and TiO2/CdSeS/C60 (Fig. 4b, recorded at λex = 370 nm), the band edge emission of CdSeS is observed at 568 nm, which quenched two-fold when combined with TiO2 and by three-fold when CdSeS QDs were anchored onto a TiO2/C60 electrode. The conduction band position of CdSeS is −0.64 V versus NHE, which is at more negative potentials compared with TiO2 and C60; therefore, the emission quenching is ascribed to electron transfer from CdSeS to TiO2 or/and C60. These positions were used in the energy band diagram shown in Fig. 5. The emission spectrum of a TiO2/CdS/CdSeS electrode shows two peaks (Fig. 4c), a broad one centered at ∼515 nm due to CdS, followed by an intense strong peak at 568 nm due to CdSeS. Both the emission maxima decrease progressively upon inclusion of C60 and Au@PAA in the electrode. The workfunction of Au@PAA is 5.1 eV, which is again conducive for accepting electrons from CdS or CdSeS QDs. However, to indubitably confirm electron transfer mode from excited states of CdS or CdSeS to TiO2, C60 and Au@PAA, emission decay lifetimes were measured for various electrodes. To identify clearly the contributions of CdS and CdSeS, the spectra were deconvoluted. The ratio of the integrated intensities of the two peaks (I515/I568) was less than unity (0.81) for the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS electrode. The emission due to CdSeS is dominant in all the three cases, possibly due to a higher quantum yield and also due to increased electron density in the VB of CdSeS, as electron transfer from the VB of CdS to VB of CdSeS is energetically favorable but the converse is not possible; however, the emission of CdS does not disappear completely. As can be seen from an enlarged view in the inset of Fig. 4c, the emission of CdS is quenched considerably due to efficient electron transfer, but it remains finite and does not merge with the baseline.

The fluorescence data was fitted to bi-exponential curves on the basis of χ2 values, and the plots of the residuals and fitted parameters are summarized in Table 1. In eqn (1) and (2), τi and Bi are decay time constants and amplitudes, respectively, of the individual decay components and 〈τ〉 is average electron lifetime. f(t) = B1e−t/τ1 + B2e−t/τ2(1) 〈τ〉 = ΣiBiτi2/ΣiBiτi(2)

All materials were assembled on FTO/glass electrodes unless mentioned otherwise. 
For pristine CdS QDs, the average electron lifetime is 13.2 ns, which includes a long-lived component, arising predominantly from band edge recombination, and a short-lived component, arising from electron–hole recombination in trap states.31 For the TiO2/CdS electrode, the average lifetime decreased to 5.6 ns, indicative of electron transfer from the conduction band of CdS to TiO2, and it further decreased to 1.8 ns in the TiO2/CdS/C60 electrode, clearly illustrating the role of C60 molecules in promoting charge transfer. Similarly, for pristine CdSeS QDs, when excited at the same wavelength as CdS, i.e. at 370 nm but with emission monitored at 568 nm (Fig. 6b), the average electron lifetime was 8.9 ns, which decreased to 1.66 ns in the TiO2/CdSeS electrode, and further to 1.32 ns in the TiO2/CdSeS/C60 electrode. This corroborates with the fluorescence quenching response and affirms electron transfer from CdSeS to TiO2 and C60.
To probe the interactive effects between CdS and CdSeS, the emission decay profiles of a CdS/CdSeS/glass electrode were monitored at the emission maximum of CdS and CdSeS independently by fixing the excitation wavelength in both cases at 370 nm (Fig. 6c). In this assembly, due to the absence of any other electron acceptor, (i) electron–hole recombination and (ii) electron transfer as dictated by conduction band positions will be the only two depopulation pathways available to the photoexcited electrons in CdS and CdSeS. The excitation wavelength was fixed at 370 nm as it will excite both CdS and CdSeS. At λem = 515 nm, the average lifetime was estimated to be 1.09 ns, and since pristine CdSeS did not show any emission at 515 nm, this lifetime can be assumed to be arising from only charge-separation in CdS. When λem was fixed at 568 nm, the average lifetime was 11.1 ns, and the emission primarily originates from CdSeS QDs. It must be recalled that the emission peak of pristine CdS QDs spans a broad wavelength range of 475–580 nm. However, the fact that the λmax for pristine CdS is 515 nm, CdS QDs have a tangible emission at 568 nm, and the emission intensity is 7.5 times lower than that of pristine CdSeS QDs enabled us to attribute the lifetime of 11.1 ns mainly to CdSeS. While the average lifetime of CdS decreases from 13.2 to 1.09 ns, when brought in contact with CdSeS the lifetime of CdSeS QDs increases from 8.9 to 11.13 ns. The conduction band edges of CdS and CdSeS are 3.61 and 3.86 eV, respectively, indicating that photogenerated carriers in CdS can be injected into the CB of CdSeS, whereas the reverse flow is not possible. This thermodynamically permissible driving force for electron transfer is responsible for the reduced electron lifetime of CdS QDs and increased electron lifetime of CdSeS QDs, because now, in addition to the deactivation of electrons generated by direct excitation in CdSeS, electrons that cascaded from CdS also need to be depopulated. A similar observation was made in the past for a TiO2/CdS/CdSe system wherein the lifetime of CdS (1.37 ns) was prolonged compared with TiO2/CdS (0.69 ns) owing to carrier injection from CdSe to CdS, dictated by the energy level offsets that favored this electron transfer mode.32
Further evidence in support of electron cascade from CdS to CdSeS in the multicomponent electrode of TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60 is observed in terms of the average lifetimes of 0.78 ns obtained at λem = 515 nm and 1.43 ns attained at λem = 568 nm (Fig. 6d). Compared with 1.8 ns observed for the TiO2/CdS/C60 electrode at the same λex and λem, this lifetime has decreased by 43.3% upon introduction of CdSeS. This indicates that an additional excited electron deactivation pathway from CdS to CdSeS is used, which causes this further drop in the average lifetime of CdS. The TiO2/CdSeS/C60 electrode showed an electron lifetime of 1.32 ns, and this is increased by 7.69% in the presence of CdS, thus providing evidence for electron acceptance by CdSeS from CdS. The role of Au@PAA in facilitating the overall charge transport capability of the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60 electrode is reflected in the significantly reduced average electron lifetimes of 0.2 ns (for CdS) and 0.59 (for CdSeS) ns observed for the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA electrode. Because the average lifetimes are the lowest for the electrodes with Au@PAA, irrespective of whether we used the emission wavelength of CdS or CdSeS as the probe, it is evident that charge transfer and transport are facile in this electrode. Therefore, this electrode is expected to be highly efficient in generating high photocurrents when incorporated into a photoelectrochemical cell. In a previous report, electron lifetimes of 0.058 ns, 0.22 ns and 0.019 ns were obtained for CdSeS, CdSe, CdSe nanorods linked to TiO2 nanorods, but they were prepared by a complex chemical vapor deposition method.21 Typically for CdSe QDs molecularly linked to TiO2 or CdS QDs deposited by SILAR on TiO2, the electron lifetimes are in the range of 0.8–8 ns, which match well with our values.16,31
The average emission lifetimes were used to estimate the electron transfer rates to include both the short- and long-lived components. The rates of electron transfer were obtained from the following expressions at the emission maxima of 515 and 568 nm separately. k = 1/〈τ〉(TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA) − 1/〈τ〉(TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60)(3)
The apparent electron transfer rates (k) to Au@PAA from the photo-absorbers/TiO2/C60 system were deduced to be 3.74 × 109 s−1 and 0.99 × 109 s−1, respectively, at λem = 515 nm and λem = 568 nm. The rate of electron transfer is faster from CdS compared with CdSeS, owing to the additional electrons that are injected from CdS into CdSeS. The rate constant for electron transfer from CdS to CdSeS was also determined from eqn (3) using the average lifetimes at λem = 515 nm. It was found to be 8.4 × 108 s−1. In an earlier report, the electron transfer rates from CdSeS and CdSe to TiO2 were observed to lie in the range of 108 to 1010 s−1.20 When photoexcited electrons populate the conduction bands of CdS and CdSeS, electron depopulation via charge transfer to TiO2 or C60 or Au@PAA is faster for CdS than that for CdSeS.
2.4 Energetics of the photoanode
The energy band diagrams illustrating the various electron transfer channels dictated by conduction band alignments in the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA electrode are shown in Fig. 5. Since HRTEM also showed lattice fringes from CdS and CdSeS to be overlapping/juxtaposed in the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA electrode, this intimate direct nanoscale contact between the two photosensitizers permits electron flow from CdS to CdSeS. In an electrode containing C60 and Au@PAA, such as TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA, C60 is in contact with FTO (during electrophoresis, C60 tethers to FTO by percolating through TiO2), and in electrodes devoid of C60, TiO2 is in contact with FTO. When C60 and/or a Au@PAA nanoparticle colloid is brought in contact with the TiO2/QD assembly or TiO2, the Fermi level of the nanoparticle/molecular acceptor equilibrates with the Fermi level of the semiconductor (TiO2). Such charge equilibration causes the Fermi levels of the semiconductor and the nano-moiety to shift. While the VB, CB positions and workfunctions of the individual components of the photoanode are known (by CV and absorption measurements as shown in the energy band diagram), the unknown equilibrated Fermi level of the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS assembly after having formed an composite with C60 and Au@PAA was determined by performing a Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurement of this electrode (experimental details and calculations are provided in ESI†). In KPFM, an ac bias is applied to a conducting Pt/Ir tip of a known work function, which scans the sample (TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA) surface and the localized contact potential difference (VCPD) that arises between the conducting tip and sample surface, is used for generating the surface potential map. The topography of the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA surface was also measured concurrently in tapping mode. The surface potential of the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA assembly was 300 mV and the corresponding work function calculated to be 4.7 eV. Therefore, the equilibrated Fermi level position of the photoanode is 4.7 eV. Compared with the positions of 4.5 eV for pristine C60 and pristine Au (5.1 eV), this equilibrated position is lowered by 0.2 eV for C60 and raised by 0.4 eV for Au@PAA. Upon illumination, the excited electrons from CdS and CdSeS QDs can be easily transferred to FTO, vis-à-vis the equilibrated Fermi level (involving C60, TiO2 and Au@PAA, as shown in the energy band diagram). In samples containing C60, C60 is in contact with FTO and electrons are transferred via Fermi level equilibration, whereas in samples devoid of C60, they are transferred to FTO via TiO2.
Further, the room temperature electronic conductivities of C60 and Au@PAA nanoparticles, determined by ac impedance method, by sandwiching their sols between two SS electrodes were 0.1 and 3.0 S cm−1, respectively, thus illustrating their ability to conduct electrons.
2.5 Photoelectrochemistry of solar cells
The J–V characteristics of TiO2/CdSeS, TiO2/CdS, TiO2/CdS/C60, TiO2/CdSeS/C60, TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60 and TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA photoanodes are shown in Fig. 7, and the solar cell parameters are summarized in Table 2. A MWCNT/FTO electrode was employed as the counter electrode, and a 0.1 M Na2S solution in a 3:7 (v/v) mixture of ultrapure water and methanol was used as the electrolyte. The reason for using methanol as the electrolyte solvent is provided in ESI (Fig. S4 and S5, Tables S1 and S2†). The curves were obtained under one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) of AM1.5 light. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE or η) of the TiO2/CdSeS- and TiO2/CdS-based cells were 1.19 and 2.14%, respectively, whereas upon inclusion of C60 in the photoanode matrix the cell efficiencies increased to 1.24 and 2.35%, respectively. This highlights the role of C60 in improving the current collection capability of the CdS- or CdSeS-based electrodes. However, the VOC of both the C60-based cells was lower relative to their analogue cells devoid of C60, but the higher photocurrents override the VOC drop and η increases. When both photo-absorbers CdS and CdSeS were used in conjunction with TiO2/C60, the PCE of the cell was observed to 2.91% and the VOC and JSC were 768 mV and 8.16 mA cm−2. The increase in the cell efficiencies by ∼24% and 54% compared with the solo-photo-absorber cells of TiO2/CdS/C60 and TiO2/CdSeS/C60 indicates the fact that the two photo-absorbers (with λmax in the 400–500 nm range in CdS and above 500 nm in CdSeS) successfully harvest two different regions of the visible spectrum; consequently, PCE and photocurrents increase when a combination of the two is utilized. In the past, a maximum efficiency of 2.77% was achieved for a TiO2/CdSeS-based cell, wherein CdSeS of two different compositions were anchored onto the semiconducting TiO2 scaffold;20 moreover, they obtained a JSC of 10.7 mA cm−2 and a fill factor or FF of 0.49. In another report, a high JSC of about 8 mA cm−2 was obtained for a TiO2/CdSe nanorod cell, and these values were only slightly lower for their CdS and CdSeS counterparts; however, PCE values were not reported by the authors.21 A cell based on CdS coated on TiO2 nanowires with Pt as the counter electrode showed a PCE of 1.51%.33 A cell composed of CdS/TiO2 electrode prepared by a one-step microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition method and Au/FTO as the counter electrode showed a PCE of 1.18% and a JSC of 7.2 mA cm−2.34 A noteworthy report on a sandwich-design cell containing CdS/TiO2–CdSe/TiO2 as the photoanode, in which the photosensitizer–semiconductor combination was synthesized in the form of paints and applied directly to FTO coated glass, employed Cu2S/reduced graphene oxide as the counter electrode, and the PCE was 1.08% and the FF was 0.59.35 For a cell based on CdSe QDs encapsulated within fullerene–thiol based shells via covalent tethering, the authors attained a VOC of 37 mV and a JSC of 395 μA cm−2.36 A more detailed overview of efficiencies for CdS or CdSeS systems is presented in Table S3.†

The dual photo-absorber-based cell with both C60 and Au@PAA showed the highest PCE among all cells studied herein. The PCE was 3.60%, and the VOC, JSC and FF were 756 mV, 9.83 mA cm−2 and 0.485, respectively, which confirmed the fact that the following attributes of the individual components: (i) the wider absorption of visible spectrum by using dual photo-absorbers CdS and CdSeS, (ii) the ease of charge propagation imparted by Au@PAA and C60 and (iii) the plasmonic effect of Au@PAA combine synergistically to result in greatly enhanced solar cell parameters. The plasmonic effect of Au@PAA is particularly significant in increasing the JSC of the solar cell, because this effect enhances the light absorption by CdS/CdSeS in the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA electrode, which translates to higher photocurrents. The effect of C60 was assessed by comparing the performances of the cell with and without C60. In the absence of C60, the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS cell showed a lower efficiency of 2.76% (lesser by 5.15% compared with cell with C60), reiterating that both C60 and Au@PAA plasmons are crucial for realizing high-performance cells. Furthermore, under 0.65 sun irradiance (65 mW cm−2), the composite-based cell showed a high PCE of 5.005%. The effect of Au@PAA on the stability of photoanode, in the presence the S2− electrolyte was studied by measuring J–V characteristics of the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA photoanode after extended exposure of this electrode (48 h) to a S2− electrolyte (Fig. S6 and Table S4†). We observed that the efficiency decreased marginally from 3.61 to 3.50 upon prolonged exposure, suggesting that the PAA cap inhibits the interaction between Au and S2−.
The IPCE versus wavelength responses of TiO2/CdS/C60, TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60 and TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA photoanodes are shown in Fig. 8a. The IPCE plots of TiO2/CdS, TiO2/CdSeS/C60, TiO2/CdSeS and TiO2/CdS/CdSeS are shown in Fig. 8b. The maximum IPCE is ∼48% (λ = 400/500 nm), attained by the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA photoanode. The TiO2/CdS/C60 photoanode shows a highest IPCE of 34%, which is enhanced by ∼15% upon inclusion of CdSeS and Au@PAA in the matrix. The effect of CdSeS in increasing the light-harvesting capability of the TiO2/CdS/C60 electrode in the 400–500 nm regime (wherein CdSeS has a finite absorption) and the 500–550 nm regime (wherein CdSe shows a λmax) is reflected in the increased IPCE over these wavelength regions. The TiO2/CdSeS electrode also shows a high IPCE in the 550 to 615 nm region, affirming that CdSeS can increase light harvesting in this region. For pristine TiO2/CdS, IPCE declines monotonically at wavelengths above 500 nm, whereas both TiO2/CdSeS/C60 and TiO2/CdS/CdSeS show about 7% IPCE above 550 nm. The TiO2/CdS/CdSeS electrode shows a maximum IPCE of 34.5% (at 450 nm), thus indicating the complementarity of the two QDs. Particularly, at 530 nm (which is the λmax of CdSeS), IPCE is 9% for TiO2/CdS/C60 and is half of the IPCE value registered for the same photoanode incorporating CdSeS QDs. The role of Au@PAA plasmons in enhancing the light absorption ability of CdSeS and CdS QDs is mirrored in an improved IPCE achieved over the bulk of the visible spectrum for the electrode encompassing Au@PAA. The Au@PAA nanoparticles not only increase IPCE in the region that coincides with the surface plasmon resonance peak (λSPR = 530 nm), but they also act to improve light absorption in the weakly absorbing region of 400–500 nm. Thus, longer effective optical path lengths rendered by Au@PAA plasmons in the photoanode result in the observed improved IPCE performance. In an earlier study, IPCE values varying between 30% and 40% were achieved in the 400–500 nm wavelength range for a cell containing CdS–TiO2 and CdSe–TiO2, wherein the photoactive materials were synthesized in paint forms, and the mixture was coated on conducting substrates.35 A maximum IPCE of 8% was achieved for a cell with CdSe–C60 as the photoanode, and authors observed that IPCE decreased to <1% for cells devoid of C60;37 moreover, they concluded that C60 enables ultrafast photo-induced charge injection from CdSe, which plays a significant role in improving the overall photoelectrochemical response of the cell.37 IPCE in the range of 40–50% was attained between 400 and 500 nm for a tandem cell based on a mixture of red-, green- and orange-light-absorbing CdSeS QDs tethered to TiO2.20 In another report, a strikingly high IPCE of 55% was achieved for an ordered array of CdSeS or CdS nanorods coated on TiO2 nanorods.21 However, the electrodes were prepared by chemical vapor deposition using a vapor-solid process.21 Our values are comparable to state-of-the art values; moreover, because our method of preparing the electrodes is simple and requires no inert atmosphere or expensive equipment, it can be adapted to other QD configurations.
 Fig. 8  IPCE spectra of photoelectrochemical solar cells with the following photoanodes: (a) TiO2/CdS/C60 (△), TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60 (○) and TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA (□) and (b) TiO2/CdS (▽), TiO2/CdSeS/C60 (☆), TiO2/CdSeS () and TiO2/CdS/CdSeS (◇). A 0.1 M Na2S in ultrapure water–methanol 3:7 (v/v) solution was employed as the electrolyte and a MWCNT/FTO assembly was used as a counter electrode. 
The effect of Au@PAA plasmons in decreasing the internal resistance of the photoanode was studied by EIS spectra. The Nyquist plots of TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60 and TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA photoanodes, recorded under dc potentials of ∼770 and 760 mV (equivalent to their VOC values) under illumination and an ac amplitude of 10 mV over a frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.01 Hz, are shown in Fig. 9a. The overall impedance offered by the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA electrode to charge transfer and transport is lower over the entire frequency range compared to the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60 electrode. Both plots comprise a large semicircle, which appears to be a composite of two semicircles (especially in the electrode with Au@PAA). The first one in the high frequency region arises from the electron transfer process at the MWCNT/S2− interface, and the resistance for the electrodes with and without Au@PAA are 58 Ω and 80 Ω, respectively. The impedance in the intermediate frequencies originates from the charge transfer at the photoanode/S2− interface. The distorted response in the low frequency domain in both electrodes is due to diffusion of the electrolyte species. We fitted the data into an equivalent circuit, shown in Fig. 9b, comprising three resistors and three capacitors. The RCT for the cell with Au@PAA at the photoanode/S2− interface is 590 Ω, whereas for the cell without Au@PAA it is 740 Ω. The Au@PAA nanoparticles lower the charge transfer resistance of the photoanode. More studies will be undertaken in future to discern the role of Au@PAA.

3. Experimental details
3.1 Chemicals
Cadmium oxide, oleic acid, sulfur powder, sodium citrate, cadmium acetate (Cd(CH3COO)2), sodium sulfide (Na2S), sulfur, acetyl acetone and solvents: 1-butanol, methanol and toluene were obtained from Merck. 1-Octadecene, trioctylphosphine (TOP), titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), Triton X-100, fullerene (C60), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, purity >98%) and selenium powder were procured from Aldrich. TiO2 powder (P25) was a gift from Evonik. Poly(acrylic acid) or PAA was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Deionized water with a resistivity of ∼18.2 MΩ cm was obtained from a Millipore Direct-Q3 UV system. Inorganic transparent electrodes of SnO2:F coated glass (FTO, sheet resistance: 14 Ω cm−2) were obtained from Pilkington and were cleaned in a soap solution, 30% HCl solution, twice distilled water and acetone, in that sequence, prior to use.
3.2 TiO2 plates, Au@PAA and CdSeS QDs
FTO substrates were kept immersed in an aqueous TiCl4 (0.04 M) solution at 70 °C for 20 min, and a dense TiO2 layer was overlaid using a paste of TiO2 powder (0.3 g) dispersed uniformly in a clear formulation of acetyl acetone (1.5 mL), ultrapure water (8.5 mL) and Triton X-100 (20 mg) by doctor blading. The as-deposited TiO2 plates were heated at 80 °C for 30 min, which was followed by annealing at 500 °C for another 30 min. In order to increase light scattering, one more layer of TiO2 was also deposited using the same steps as mentioned above, followed by heating and annealing as performed for the active layer. The TiO2-coated FTO substrate was eventually dipped in an aqueous TiCl4 (40 mM) solution for 30 min at 70 °C. The resulting TiO2 film was rinsed in distilled water and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min.
Ligand exchange of Au nanoparticles by PAA was accomplished using a previously reported procedure.38 Briefly, sodium citrate (2 mM) was dissolved in ultrapure water (150 mL) and refluxed at 100 °C accompanied by vigorous stirring for 15 min, then HAuCl4 (25 mM) was injected. The color of the solution changed from yellow to bluish-green and subsequently to pink. The solution was centrifuged, and the clear solution obtained was decanted and then diluted with an equivalent volume of the supernatant. Then, the sediment that was present was discarded. To this solution, 40 μL of aqueous NaOH (0.5 M) solution was added to control pH and 10 μL of 25% poly(acrylic acid) or PAA in ultrapure water was added, and then incubated with sonication for 3 h at room temperature. The resulting purplish colloid of Au@PAA was stored at 5 °C.
We followed a previously reported hot injection method for preparing CdSeS QDs.20,39 In a 50 mL flat bottom flask, CdO (0.386 mM), oleic acid (1.63 mM) and 1-octadecene (10 mL) were taken under Ar atmosphere and degassed at 80 °C for 1 hour. Then, when the temperature of the mixture was raised to 300 °C, the mixture became clear. At this point, a premixed sulfur and selenium (1:40, molar ratio) solution in TOP was injected into the above solution and was cooled to room temperature. To this cooled solution, n-butanol (20 mL) was added, and orange-red colored CdSeS QDs precipitated. The QDs were collected by centrifugation and washed by dispersion in toluene, followed by re-precipitation by addition of methanol. The washing procedure in toluene was repeated four times; the obtained CdSeS QDs were stored in toluene in the dark.
3.3 Photoanode construction
Fullerene was deposited electrophoretically over the TiO2 film by using a solution of C60 in toluene (10 mg in 10 mL). A constant potential of 60 V was applied for 25 min using a Tarsons electrophoresis power supply. The color of the solution faded and the formation of a brown-colored film indicated the deposition of the C60. The film was rinsed in toluene and dried. CdS QDs were deposited over the TiO2/C60 film using the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. In this method, clear solutions of Cd(CH3COO)2 (0.1 M) and Na2S (0.1 M) in methanol, which were in two separate beakers, acted as the cadmium and sulfide precursors, respectively. The TiO2/C60 film was dipped in Cd(CH3COO)2 solution for 2 min, rinsed in methanol to remove excess ions, followed by drying. It was then dipped in the Na2S solution for 2 min, again followed by methanol rinsing and drying and this cadmium salt dip followed by sulfide solution dip is regarded as one cycle of CdS deposition. In a similar way, eight more cycles were performed and a TiO2/CdS/C60 film was obtained. TiO2/CdS electrodes were obtained by processing TiO2 plates to eight cycles of SILAR in Cd(CH3COO)2 and Na2S.
For CdSeS electrodes, a pre-treatment step was performed. The TiO2 electrode was immersed in a solution of pristine CdSeS QDs for 6 h, and a layer of the QDs adsorbed onto the oxide surface. For the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60 or TiO2/CdSeS/C60 electrodes, a solution of CdSeS QDs in toluene and C60 dissolved in toluene were mixed in a 5:1 (v/v) ratio, and the resulting solution was subjected to electrophoresis (60 V, 25 min). An orange-red-brown colored film indicated the deposition of CdSeS/C60 on TiO2. For TiO2/CdS/CdSeS or TiO2/CdSeS electrodes, a solution of CdSeS QDs without C60 was used for electrophoresis. Furthermore, Au nanoparticles were incorporated in any of the electrodes by drop-casting a layer of Au@PAA colloid over the electrode and evaporation of solvent by drying in air. The Au@PAA attaches to the CdS- or CdSeS-based electrodes by the virtue of Au–S interactions, and it attaches to neat TiO2 in the TiO@/Au@PAA electrodes due to COO− (from PAA)–Ti4+ interactions, similar to the interactions between the carboxylate groups of Ru-dye and Ti4+ in a DSSC.40 The sequential deposition process is illustrated in Scheme 1.
MWCNTs (200 mg) were added to 60 mL of 1:3 v/v solution of H2SO4:HNO3 (each of 6 M strength) and refluxed for 12 h at 80 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted with ultrapure water (50 mL) and then washed with ultrapure water until the supernatant showed a neutral pH. Using ashless fast filter paper (Ø: 150 mm), the resulting brown-colored solid was collected, dried at room temperature and dispersed in water by sonication for 2 h. By electrophoretic deposition at 60 V, a thin layer of functionalized MWCNTs was deposited over FTO/glass substrates. Then, the films were washed in water and dried in air and used as counter electrode for photovoltaic measurements.
3.4 Characterization techniques
HRTEM images of QDs, electrode samples, Au@PAA nanoparticles were obtained on a HRTEM FEI Tecnai G2 F30 STWIN with a FEG source operating at 300 kV. For TEM, a thin layer of the sample was carefully transferred onto a carbon-coated copper grid of 3.05 mm diameter, and the solvent was evaporated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of electrodes were recorded on a PANalytical X'PertPRO instrument with Cu-Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. Surface morphology analysis of electrodes was performed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss Supra 40 FE-SEM). The optical absorption spectra of the films were measured in the diffuse reflectance mode and converted to absorbance using the Kubelka–Munk function, whereas for solutions, spectra were measured in absorbance mode in quartz cuvettes on a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600). Photoluminescence spectra of films were measured on a Horiba Flouromax-4 fluorescence spectrometer. A suitable filter was utilized during the measurement and background correction was also applied. The time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) method was used for deducing emission lifetimes with a Horiba Jobin Yvon Data Station HUB functioning in the TCSPC mode. A nano LED diode emitting pulses at 370 nm with a 1 MHz repetition rate and a pulse duration of 1.3 ns was employed as an excitation source. Light-scattering Ludox solution (colloidal silica) was used to acquire the instrument response function (prompt). A long-pass 500 nm filter was placed in front of the emission monochromator for all measurements. Horiba Jobin Yvon DAS6 fluorescence decay analysis software was used to fit the model function (tri-exponential decays) to the experimental data with appropriate correction for the instrument response. Current versus potential (I–V) data were measured using a Newport Oriel 3A solar simulator with a Keithley model 2420 digital source meter. A 450 W Xenon arc lamp was the light source; it provided a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 of Air Mass (AM) 1.5 illumination. The spatial uniformity of irradiance was confirmed by calibrating with a 2 cm × 2 cm Si reference cell traceable to NREL and re-affirmed with a Newport power meter. Before collection of I–V data, each electrode was allowed to reach equilibrium at open-circuit. Incident photon to current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) were recorded using a quantum efficiency measurement system (Oriel IQE-200™), which is capable of measurements compliant to ASTM E1021-06. The instrument provided the external quantum efficiency or IPCE directly as a function of wavelength, over a range of 350–800 nm. The light source was a 250 W quartz tungsten halogen lamp, the monochromator path length was 1/8 M, and the spot size was 1 mm × 2.5 mm rectangular at focus. For impedance measurements, an ac voltage of 10 mV superimposed over dc potentials was applied to the photoanode and Z′′ versus Z′ plots were obtained under irradiance over a frequency range of 106 to 10−2 Hz using an Autolab PGSTAT 302N equipped with frequency response analyzer.
4. Conclusions
A combination of CdS and CdSeS QDs as photosensitizers, C60 as molecular acceptors and Au@PAA nanoparticles for inducing plasmonic enhancement in photocurrents were assembled on TiO2, which functioned as the wide band gap semiconductor scaffold, to yield a photoanode. The wider absorption range afforded by combining CdS and CdSeS QDs (relative to CdS and CdSeS alone) and the increased light harvesting by the dots induced by near-field plasmonic effect of Au@PAA plasmons was demonstrated. Emission quenching and decay analyses provided unambiguous proof in support of fast electron transfer from CdS or CdSeS to Au@PAA or C60. Moreover, favorably positioned work functions of C60 and Au@PAA relative to the conduction bands of CdS and CdSeS contribute to improving photocurrents. An overall best power conversion efficiency of 3.61% was attained for the TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA electrode, which is 1.3 times higher than that achieved for an electrode with neither C60 nor Au@PAA, when used in a solar cell with S2− as electrolyte and MWCNTs as counter electrode. The TiO2/CdS/CdSeS/C60/Au@PAA cell showed the highest IPCE (∼48%), thereby confirming the role of plasmonic and conductive effects in bringing about substantial improvements in photovoltaic parameters.
