    , Accepted 10th September 2018First published on 13th September 2018AbstractIn the last three years, the A2–A1–D–A1–A2 skeleton has become increasingly popular in the design of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), and it could match particularly well with the classic p-type polymer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). In this manuscript, we successfully synthesized three NFAs with this skeleton, named BTA100, BTA101 and BTA103, where BTA units were substituted by methoxy groups and used as the middle electron-accepting unit (A1). To fine-tune the energy levels of the final BTA-based NFAs, three different electron-deficient building blocks, thiazolidine-2,4-dione (TD), rhodanine (R) and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine (RCN), were used as the end groups (A2), respectively. The introduction of methoxy groups into BTA can upshift the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of NFAs and realize high open-circuit voltage (VOC) organic solar cells. In addition, the O atom shows a weak interaction with the S atom in the neighbouring thiophene ring, which might be able to facilitate intramolecular charge transfer. The organic solar cell (OSC) device based on P3HT:BTA103 shows a high PCE of 5.31% with a VOC of 0.94 V, a JSC of 8.56 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.66. In addition, it is worth noting that the VOC of P3HT:BTA100 reached 1.34 V, which is one of the highest values for P3HT based solar cells. These results indicate that RCN is also an effective end group to construct NFAs and methoxy substitution is a simple method to improve the VOC for P3HT-based OSC devices.
1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) type organic solar cells (OSCs) have undergone rapid development in the last decade, and they generally contain a p-type material as an electron donor and an n-type material as an electron acceptor. In particular, the development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs)1,2 has led to a rapid increase of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), which have now exceeded 14%.3,4 A great advantage of NFAs is that their opto-electronic properties can be easily modulated by the design of their chemical structures. At present, there are mainly two kinds of most successful NFAs. The first one is an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type low-band gap fused-ring-electron-acceptor (FREA),5–8 where A is 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) and its analogs.3,9–14 The other one is based on perylene diimides (PDIs)15–18 with linear or multi-arm structures. The highest PCEs of these two NFAs blended with suitable p-type polymers reached 14.4%10 and 10.58%,15 respectively. Although these two kinds of NFA could be paired with many p-type polymers, they do not match with the classic p-type polymer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). In the P3HT case, these two kinds of NFAs showed inferior photovoltaic performance with the highest PCEs of just 1.25%19 and 2.61%,20 respectively.
In fact, P3HT is the most common photovoltaic donor material and its use has greatly promoted the development of OSCs. P3HT can be synthesized by a simple method on a large scale, thus it is suitable for large-area photovoltaic devices.21 However, a high-lying HOMO of ∼5.0 eV and a large band gap of ∼1.9 eV result in a low open-circuit voltage (VOC) of ∼0.6 V and a short-circuit current (JSC) of ∼10 mA cm−2 for the P3HT:PCBM system.22 Therefore, it is important to design new acceptor materials that match with P3HT perfectly.
The A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFAs23–25 have been proved to match well with P3HT. The earliest material was FBR, where fluorene (F), benzothiazole (BT) and rhodanine (R) were used as D, A1 and A2, respectively. OSCs based on P3HT:FBR realized a PCE of 4.1%.26 After that, the middle unit of D was changed to indacenodithiophene (IDT)27 with different side chains and the final small molecules could realize high PCEs of 5.1–6.4%,28–30 respectively. In addition, the end-capped segment A2 could be further optimized to thiazolidine-2,4-dione (TD) and the final small molecule of BT2b achieved a PCE of 6.08%.31 However, the VOC of OSCs based on such materials is relatively low. In order to improve the VOC, in our previous works, we introduced the electron-deficient building block of benzotriazole (BTA) to the design of NFAs for the first time. The BTA-based NFAs have a high-lying LUMO energy level and the VOC could be largely improved to 1.02 V for BTA132 and 1.22 V for BTA2,22 although the PCEs slightly decreased to 5.24% for BTA132 and 4.50% for BTA2.22 These results indicate that BTA-based NFAs are good candidates for P3HT-based OSCs.
In order to expand the range of BTA-based NFAs, in this paper, we introduce methoxy groups to the BTA segment and use it as A1. To fine-tune the energy levels of the final BTA-based NFAs, three different electron-deficient building blocks, thiazolidine-2,4-dione (TD), rhodanine (R) and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine (RCN), were used as the end groups A2, respectively. On the one hand, the methoxy group can further increase the LUMO energy level of the material and obtain a high VOC. On the other hand, the O atom shows a weak interaction with the S atom in the neighbouring thiophene ring, which might be able to facilitate intramolecular charge transfer.33,34 The chemical structures and synthesis method are shown in Scheme 1. The effects of end-capped segments on the absorption spectra, energy levels, crystallinity and photovoltaic performance are investigated in detail, and we hope that the results could provide important information for the further design of novel NFAs to pair with P3HT.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization of BTA100, BTA100 and BTA103

Materials synthesis. 
The synthesis routes of the three small molecule acceptors BTA100, BTA101 and BTA103 are depicted in Scheme 1. 1,2-Dimethoxybenzene was initially converted to compound 1 by the nitration reaction. The reduction of compound 1 with stannous chloride in 12 N HCl gave compound 2,35 which was treated immediately with NaNO2 to afford compound 3. The alkylation of compound 3 was carried out in N,N-dimethylformamide with sodium hydride and 1-bromooctane in a good yield.36 The position of the alkyl group in compound 4 was confirmed by 1H NMR. The bromination of compound 4 was completed easily by stirring in acetic acid and dichloromethane with liquid bromine for two days at room temperature.35 Compound 6 was synthesized from compound 5 by bromine–lithium exchange, then by adding DMF to get the formyl group.37 By using the Stille coupling reaction between compound 6 and compound 7 with a 2:1 molar ratio, compound 8 with two formyl groups as end groups was obtained, which was then followed by Knoevenagel condensation38 with different end groups to give BTA100, BTA101 and BTA103. The detailed synthetic procedures are provided in the Experimental section of the ESI.†
The three small acceptor materials were clearly characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MALDI-TOF MS spectra, which are shown in Fig. S1–S3, respectively, in the ESI.† Furthermore, these three small molecules are highly soluble in common chlorinated solvents, such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), and o-chlorobenzene (DCB), which makes them feasible to fabricate solution-processed OSC devices.
The structures of the acceptors were calculated by density functional theory (DFT) using Gaussian at the B3LYP/6-31G level of theory, as depicted in Fig. 1. All the molecules adopt an almost planar geometry, which facilitates the molecular π–π stacking. At the same time, there are four benzene rings with alkyl chains on the side of the plane skeleton, which could effectively prevent the excessive aggregation of molecules. Through Gaussian calculations, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels are −4.98/−2.81 eV (BTA100), −5.05/−2.99 eV (BTA101), and −5.21/−3.18 eV (BTA103), which indicates that the energy levels of the BTA-based small molecules could be efficiently downshifted by increasing the electron-withdrawing ability of the end-capped groups. The calculated bandgaps of the three molecules are 2.17, 2.06 and 2.03 eV, respectively, due to the larger downshift of the LUMO than that of the HOMO.

Absorption spectra and electronic energy levels. 
The absorption spectra of BTA100, BTA101 and BTA103 in CHCl3 solution and thin film, together with P3HT in film form for comparison, are shown in Fig. 2a and b. BTA100 in solution showed a broad and strong absorption in the 450–600 nm region with a maximum molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 1.18 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1 at 556 nm. Interestingly, BTA101 has the same coefficient as BTA100 and a maximum absorption at 593 nm in solution, which was red-shifted by 37 nm compared with that of BTA100. Importantly, the maximum absorption peak of BTA103 is 617 nm with an ε of 1.3 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1, which indicates that RCN is an effective end-capping group to improve the absorption spectrum of NFAs. In addition, all the BTA100, BTA101 and BTA103 films exhibit obvious shoulder peaks and the maxima were red-shifted by 8 nm, 13 nm and 10 nm compared with that in solution, indicating that strong π–π stacking exists in the films. Due to the absorption of P3HT being located in the range 400–650 nm, the BTA103 films can form a better complementary absorption than BTA100 and BTA101, which might contribute to improving the short circuit current (JSC) of the OSC device. The optical bandgaps of BTA100, BTA101 and BTA103 in thin film form are 2.05 eV, 1.88 eV and 1.76 eV, respectively. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 1.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the BTA100, BTA101 and BTA103 thin films were measured by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) and are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.†BTA100, BTA101 and BTA103 display reversible oxidation and quasi-reversible reduction waves. According to the equations of LUMO = −e(φred + 4.8) (eV) and HOMO = −e(φox + 4.8) (eV), where φred and φox are the onset of reduction and oxidation potentials vs. FeCp0/+2, whose absolute energy level is 4.8 eV below vacuum, the LUMO/HOMO levels of BTA100, BTA101 and BTA103 were calculated to be −3.23/−5.32 eV, −3.55/−5.41 eV and −3.64/−5.37 eV. The ΔELUMO (LUMO offset of donor and acceptor) and the ΔEHOMO (HOMO offset of donor and acceptor) for P3HT:BTA101 and P3HT:BTA103 are beyond 0.3 eV, which guarantees effective hole and electron transfer. However, the ΔELUMO for P3HT:BTA100 is just 0.13 eV, which might hinder the hole transfer from P3HT to BTA100.

2.2 Photovoltaic properties of the P3HT:BTA100, P3HT:BTA100 and P3HT:BTA103 devices
The fullerene-free OSCs were fabricated with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS ((poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrene-sulfonate)))/active layer/Ca/Al. The active layer consists of BTA100, BTA101 or BTA103 as the electron acceptor and P3HT as the electron donor. The J–V curves of the optimized devices with different solvents, weight ratios and annealing temperatures are shown in Fig. 3a. Table 2 lists the detailed device parameters including VOC, JSC, fill factor (FF) and PCE values. All optimal photovoltaic parameters are provided for the PSCs in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The active layers of the three combinations have a similar thickness of 80–85 nm. Without additives, the OSC device based on P3HT:BTA100 shows a high VOC of 1.34 V with a low PCE of 1.04%, a JSC of 1.65 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.47. The device based on P3HT:BTA101 shows a higher VOC of 1.19 V with a PCE of 3.55%, a JSC of 5.3 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.56. Importantly, the PCE of the P3HT:BTA103 device reaches 5.31% with a VOC of 0.94 V, and these values are significantly higher than that of the PC61BM-based control device (VOC = 0.61 V and PCE = 3.67%). The device optimization results imply that although the device with the P3HT:BTA100 blend film achieved the highest voltage of 1.34 eV, it did not achieve the best device performance due to the mismatching LUMO energy levels. However, the device with the P3HT:BTA103 blend film obtained the best photovoltaic results due to good complementary absorption, which indicates that the end-capped group is very important for the design of NFAs. In order to further improve the JSC of the photovoltaic devices, the solvent additive of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) was tested, but the additive had a negative effect for all the three material combinations.

In order to investigate the origin of this difference in JSC, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) plots of the photovoltaic devices based on P3HT:BTA100, P3HT:BTA101 and P3HT:BTA103 fabricated under different conditions are shown in Fig. 3b. All the plots show similar shapes in the 300–750 nm region but with different values. The maximum values of EQE remarkably increased from 13.4% in P3HT:BTA100 to 36.5% in P3HT:BTA101 and further to 51.7% in P3HT:BTA103, respectively, indicating that the difference in JSC is the result of different electrical or excitonic processes in the devices.

The hole mobility and electron mobility of the P3HT:BTA100 (1:1, w/w), P3HT:BTA101 (1:1, w/w) and P3HT:BTA103 (0.5:1, w/w) blend film devices were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The plots of the J−V curves of the hole-only and electron-only devices are provided in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of the thermal-annealed P3HT:BTA100 film were calculated to be 4.4 × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.85 × 10−9 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are lower than those of P3HT:BTA101 with a μh of 2.28 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 1.44 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, the blend film of P3HT:BTA103 exhibited a higher hole mobility and electron mobility of 1.46 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.52 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Although the μh of P3HT:BTA103 is slightly lower, the high electron transport should contribute to the high PCE because it is helpful to the charge transport and collection in the photovoltaic device.

2.3 Morphology of the blend films
The nanoscale morphology of the blend films is one of the important factors affecting JSC because it can affect the efficiencies of exciton diffusion and exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface as well as free charge transportation and free charge collection by the electrodes. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping-mode was utilized to investigate the film morphology of the active layers of the OSCs. The heights (5 μm × 5 μm) of the annealed blend films are displayed in Fig. 5. The blend film P3HT:BTA100 with annealing at 100 °C shows a small surface roughness with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.883 nm, however, due to over-stacking and no networked interpenetration structure, a high short-circuit current and efficiency are not achieved. A similar situation was also found for the P3HT:BTA101 blend film, which has a networked interpenetration structure but with a relatively rough surface (RMS = 1.72 nm) with annealing at 120 °C. Maybe this is why the P3HT:BTA101 blend film shows a higher JSC than the P3HT:BTA100 blend film. Fortunately, the blend film of P3HT:BTA103 with annealing at 100 °C shows a small surface roughness with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.739 nm and a networked interpenetration structure simultaneously, achieving the greatest JSC and PCE. From the AFM results, it could be concluded that the introduction of BTA100 into the P3HT film resulted in a large phase separation, which is also unfavorable for the JSC of the P3HT:BTA100 device.

The molecular aggregation of the blend films of P3HT:BTA100 (1:1 w/w), P3HT:BTA101 (1:1 w/w) and P3HT:BTA103 (0.5:1 w/w) was further investigated by 2D grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIWAXS). The GIWAXS images and profiles are depicted in Fig. 6, and they represent the intensity profiles versus wave vector qz and qxy corresponding to the molecular arrangement order in the out-of-plane and in-plane directions, respectively. For a single component film of P3HT, BTA100, BTA101 and BTA103, there are strong diffraction peaks at 0.37 Å−1 for P3HT and 0.35 Å−1 for BTA101 in plane and out of plane. However, only P3HT shows a clear diffraction peak (010) for π–π stacking at 1.64 Å−1 (d = 3.83 Å) out-of-plane. For the blend films, there are strong diffraction peaks at 0.37 Å−1 in plane and 0.35 Å−1 out of plane and there is no clear diffraction peak (010) for π–π stacking, which is not beneficial to the charge transport. Further material design to improve the crystallinity of NFAs might be a feasible method to increase the PCEs.

3. Conclusions
In summary, three A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type small molecule non-fullerene acceptors of BTA100, BTA101 and BTA103 with three different end groups were designed and synthesized. Due to the electron-withdrawing ability of BTA with the methoxy group unit and end groups, the LUMO orbitals of the three small molecule acceptors are almost delocalized on all of the backbones, which is favorable to electron transport. Because the energy levels and absorption spectrum of BTA103 matched well with P3HT, together with the high electron mobility (3.52 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and hole mobility (1.46 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1), the OSC device based on P3HT:BTA103 (1:2, w/w) shows a high PCE of 5.31% with a VOC of 0.94 V, a JSC of 8.56 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.66. In addition, although P3HT:BTA100 (1:1, w/w) shows the highest VOC of 1.34 V, the PCE is only 1.04% due to the excess small LUMO offset and the large phase separation of the blend film. Our results indicate that 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine (RCN) is an effective end group used in the design of NFAs for P3HT-based high performance OSC devices.
