    , Accepted 3rd October 2017First published on 4th October 2017AbstractThe binuclear copper complex [Cu(DQPD)]2 (where DQPD = deprotonated N2,N6-di(quinolin-8-yl)pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamide (DQPDH2)) was synthesised and characterised by various spectroscopic as well as electrochemical techniques. The binuclear copper complex was converted into a mononuclear one by the addition of 2 equivalents of pTsOH into [Cu(DQPD)]2. The interconversion between the dimer and monomer complex was studied through UV-Vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The mononuclear copper complex showed high catalytic activity towards electrochemical proton reduction using acetic acid as the external proton source in 95:5 (v/v) DMF/H2O. It showed an ic/ip (where ic is the catalytic current in the presence of acetic acid and ip is the reduction peak current in absence of acid) value of 24 and a turnover rate (TOF) of 111.70 s−1 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at 25 °C. The [Cu(DQPD)]2 complex evolved hydrogen under the irradiation of visible light in the presence of fluorescein (Fl) as a photosensitizer and triethylamine (TEA) as the sacrificial electron donor with an initial TOF of 0.03 s−1 with respect to the catalyst.
Introduction
Artificial photosynthesis is one of the most convenient ways to convert and store solar energy into chemical bonds. It is one of the most relevant means to fulfill the enormous needs of today's global energy demand, which is blooming day by day, and can aid the fight to prevent anthropogenic climate change.1–5 Artificial photosynthesis is delineated to photochemically split water, to give oxygen by water oxidation and hydrogen by the reduction of aqueous proton. In such an artificial photosynthetic system, the light-driven reductive side of the water-splitting reaction to produce hydrogen has attracted considerable attention since H2 can be used as an unconventional fuel vector and is one of the most appropriate alternatives for sustainable energy development.6,7 For the photo-driven generation of hydrogen from aqueous protons, both a photosensitizer and catalyst are essential, along with a sacrificial reductant, which provide electrons chemically and allow the study of reduction half reaction separately and independently from the oxidative half reaction.8–10
In nature, hydrogenase catalyses the reversible reduction of protons with a low overpotential and high turnover frequency. However, the instability of such an enzyme in the non-natural environment blocks its practical application.11–15 Molecular catalysts play a vital role in a wide range of energy-conversion processes alongside the splitting of water into proton and oxygen.16 These considerations have led to the development of a huge number of molecular catalysts exploiting more earth-abundant metals and consequently, several molecular catalysts have been reported using Co,17–29 Ni,30–38 Fe39–42 and Mo43–46 for the reduction of protons; yet these catalysts often fall short in either their catalytic efficiency or stability in the concerned acidic environment.
Synthetic copper complexes have also been extensively studied, since copper plays significant roles in a plethora of biological redox processes by virtue of its prominent biomimetic and redox chemistries;47,48 however, a much lower number of complexes have been reported to date for proton reduction.49–54
Zhan and co-workers reported a Cu-based mononuclear electrocatalyst CuL (where H2L = 2,3-bis(2-hydroxybenzylideneimino)-2,3-butenedinitrile), which could undergo electrochemical generation of hydrogen in both organic as well as aqueous media. The catalyst produced H2 in DMF medium in the presence of AcOH electrochemically with a TOF of a maximum 255 moles of H2 per mole of catalyst per hour, whereas the TOF for the H2 generation in 0.25 M phosphate buffer at pH 7 was 457 moles of H2 per mole of catalyst per hour with an overpotential of 817 mV vs. SHE.49
The copper complex [(bztpen)Cu](BF4)2 (bztpen = N-benzyl-N,N′,N′-tris(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)ethylenediamine), reported by Zhang et al., showed a high catalytic activity towards electrochemical hydrogen generation with a hydrogen generation rate constant (kobs) of over 10000 s−1 with an onset overpotential of 420 mV vs. SHE when employed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 2.5. A turnover frequency of 7000 h−1 cm−2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 96% were observed by controlled potential electrolysis at −0.9 V vs. SHE over 2 h at pH 2.5 with phosphate buffer. The generation of hydrogen by [(bztpen)Cu](BF4)2 proceeded via the coupling of a Cu(II) hydride and a pendant pyridinium.53
Several Cu corrole complexes were synthesised by Rui Cao and co-workers and their catalytic activities towards hydrogen generation were examined in CH3CN medium using TFA as the proton source. They observed that a strong electron-withdrawing group at the meso position could improve the catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. Among the copper complexes they synthesised, the copper complex of 5,15-pentafluorophenyl-10-(4-nitrophenyl) corrole showed the best catalytic activity for hydrogen generation with an ic/ip value of 303 (where ic is the catalytic current in the presence of an acid, ip is the one-electron peak current of the complex in the absence of an acid) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at 20 °C. They provided a mechanism for hydrogen generation through stopped flow spectro-electrochemistry and theoretical studies, which indicated that [(Cor)Cu]2− and [(Cor)CuH]− were key intermediates in catalytic H2 evolution.54
Herein, an active catalyst with a negatively charged ligand centre was designed and employed for hydrogen evolution. Herein, we report probably the first μ-pyridine-bridged Cu complex as an active catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen production in the presence of TEA as a sacrificial electron donor and fluorescein as a photosensitizer in 80:20 DMF/H2O. The μ-pyridine bridge cleaves in the presence of two equivalents of acid to convert into the monomeric form. The conversion between the helicate-dinuclear [Cu(DQPD)]2 complex to the mononuclear one was characterized with various spectroscopic methods. The monomeric complex was responsible for the electrochemical proton reduction when employed with AcOH in 95:5 DMF/H2O.  
Results and discussion
Synthetic procedures
The ligand N2,N6-di(quinolin-8-yl)pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamide (DQPDH2) was synthesized by the treatment of pyridine-2,6-dicarbonyl dichloride with 2.0 equivalents of 8-aminoquinoline in the presence of triethylamine in dry THF as per the reported procedure.55 A white precipitate of DQPDH2 appeared within minutes. A pre-dissolved ligand DQPDH2 in DMF was deprotonated, generating a dark yellow solution, with the addition of solid sodium hydride under inert conditions. To this solution, CuCl2·2H2O was added and allowed to stir. A pale green colour compound was precipitated in the presence of excess diethyl ether and crystallized from DMF through slow evaporation. Dark green-coloured crystals of X-ray quality were isolated after a week.
Interconversion between the dimer and monomer complex
The helicate dimer [Cu(DQPD)]2 converted to the mononuclear form [Cu(DQPDH)]+ instantaneously with the addition of two equivalents of pTsOH (Scheme 1). The monomeric complex also underwent dimerization upon deprotonation of the amide and qunolinium moiety in the presence of triethyl amine.56 Several attempts have been made to obtain single crystals of the mononuclear form, but they could not be grown successfully. The ESI mass spectra of the mononuclear complex was observed at m/z 481 (found for: C25H15CuN5O2). The in situ-formed mononuclear complex obtained by the addition of 2 equivalent of pTsOH into [Cu(DQPD)]2 in 95:5 (v/v) DMF/H2O had the same m/z value of 481.07 as that of the isolated mononuclear copper complex (Fig. S0–S3†).

Electronic spectra and bis–mono interconversion
The electronic spectra of the binuclear Cu complex [Cu(DQPD)]2 showed three absorption bands (Fig. S4†): two in the UV region at λmax = 314 nm and 380 nm and one in the visible region at λmax = 680 nm. The two absorption bands in the UV region were assigned to the charge transfer transitions. The band at λmax = 314 nm (31847 cm−1, ε = 16816 M−1 cm−1) was due to the intra-ligand charge transfer, whereas the band at λmax = 380 nm (26315 cm−1, ε = 21421 M−1 cm−1) was due to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer. The low-intensity broad band at λmax = 680 nm (14705 cm−1, ε = 42 M−1 cm−1) was assigned to the 2Eg → 2T2g transition. On the basis of the electronic spectra, a distorted octahedral geometry of the Cu complex is suggested. On the other hand, the mononuclear Cu complex had only one absorption band in the UV region at λmax = 322 nm. This band (31056 cm−1, ε = 20773 M−1 cm−1) was observed, due to the ILCT spectra, along with a shoulder at 385 nm. The band at λmax = 656 nm (15243 cm−1, ε = 127 M−1 cm−1) arose due to the d–d transition (Fig. S5†).
UV-Vis spectra for the conversion of the binuclear Cu complex [Cu(DQPD)]2 to the mononuclear complex [Cu(DQPDH)]+ was studied using pTsOH (Fig. 1). After the successive addition of 2 equivalents of pTsOH to the solution of the binuclear Cu complex, the intensity of the band at λmax = 380 nm gradually decreased along with the enhancement of λmax = 314 nm through an isobestic point at λmax = 352 nm. The spectrum of the isolated monomer [Cu(DQPDH)]+ was identical with the spectrum obtained from the addition of 2 equivalent of pTsOH. The reverse conversion from the mono to binuclear Cu complex was successfully achieved with the addition of 1 equivalent of TEA to [Cu(DQPDH)]+, as inferred from both the UV-Vis spectra (inset) in Fig. 1.

Crystallography
In complex [CuII(DQPD)]2, the asymmetric unit consisted of a homodinuclear CuII dimer along with a water and DMF molecule as the solvent in the crystallization. Two deprotonated ligands DQPD generated a symmetrical helical binding with two CuII centers having a distorted octahedral environment. Each of the copper centers was meridionally coordinated by two dianionic DQPD ligands, which behave as a tridentate ligand for the individual metal atoms. The DQPD ligand was coordinated in an eccentric mode, whereby the sporadic pyridine bridging maintained the octahedral coordination geometry for both the CuII ions. This constrained system culminated in a shorter CuII⋯CuII interaction of 3.363 Å. The bridging nitrogen atoms N(py)(4) and N(py)(9) had a longer bond distance towards the coordination at the Cu(1) (2.666 and 2.335 Å, respectively) center compared with the Cu(2) (2.608 and 2.311 Å, respectively). The trans-angles generated at the CuII centers through bridging N(py)(4) and N(py)(9) spanned from 154.43° to 158.02°, which strongly deviated from linearity. The trans-positioned carboxamido nitrogen atoms were at a closer linearity at the respective copper centers (∠N(1)Cu(1)N(2) = 175.79° and ∠N(6)Cu(2)N(7) = 173.27). The torsional angles N(1)C(19)C(20)N(4) and N(4)C(24)C(25)N(7) due to the bridging N(py)(4) atom and N(6)C(44)C(45)N(9) and N(9)C(49)C(50)N(2) due to the bridging N(py)(9) atom were respectively −16.64°, −40.73°, −22.53° and −32.52°. The higher torsion angle is the key factor for the longer pyridine bridging distances at the Cu(1) center compared to Cu(2). The planes generated by the pyridine ring bridged through the N(py)(4) atom and the quinolone rings containing N(3) and N(10) coordinating atoms, respectively, at Cu(1) and Cu(2) centers intersected each other by 29.11° and 48.53°. Similarly, the planes generated by the pyridine ring bridged through the N(9) atom and the quinolone rings with N(5) and N(8) coordinating atoms, respectively, at the Cu(1), Cu(2) centers intersected each other by 50.02° and 36.52°. The congruence of the opposite sides and opposite angles was a direct consequence of the parallelogram N(4)Cu(1)N(9)Cu(2), generated by two bridging nitrogen N(4), N(9) and Cu(1), Cu(2) atoms. The consecutive angles [(∠N(4)Cu(1)N(9) = 95.91°, ∠Cu(1)N(4)Cu(2) = 84.70°) and (∠N(4)Cu(2)N(9) = 93.78°, ∠Cu(1)N(9)Cu(2) = 85.57°)] were almost supplementary (added to ∼180°). A perspective view of the ORTEP and the μ-pyridine bridging is displayed in Fig. 2. The crystallographic data and the refinement parameters of the complex [CuII(DQPD)]2 are tabulated in Table S1.† The selected bond distances and angles are tabulated in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The complex [CuII(DQPD)]2 had a double-helical coordination of two DQPD ligands, where the ligands were interlocked in a minimised energy configuration (Fig. 3). The double-helical interlocked structure was due to the opposite orientation of the DQPD ligands (red and green coloured in the space-filled and ball-stick models) coordinated to the two copper centres separated by a distance of 3.363 Å. This compact structure interferes with the catalytic activity of the complex.

EPR spectra
The EPR spectrum of the complex [CuII(DQPD)]2 in DMF (Fig. S6†) at 298 K, shows two main resonances centered around 306 and 315 mT. The two resonances were attributed to the characteristic of an axially symmetric paramagnetic center due to the allowed transitions by the interaction between the internal magnetic moment generated by the unpaired electron of the complex and the external magnetic field of the spectrometer (Zeeman interaction). The principal components of the g-tensor were calculated directly from the resonance positions with reference to the manganese marker and are given by g⊥ = 2.113 and g‖ = 2.200, which indicates that g‖ > g⊥ and that the unpaired electron resides in a dx2−y2 ground-state orbital. In the DMF solution, the forbidden transitions appear due to ΔMS = ± 2, appearing around 185 mT in the near half-field region. The EPR spectra of [CuII(DQPD)]2 in DMF solution revealed that the two Cu centers were magnetically coupled in [CuII(DQPD)]2 (CuII⋯CuII distance of 3.363 Å) with a ground-state nuclear spin I = 3/2.57 The EPR spectrum of the polycrystalline sample of the complex [CuII(DQPD)]2 (Fig. S7†) at 298 K exhibited signals at g ≈ 1.045, around 645 mT, and at g ≈ 2.09, around 322 mT (near half-field). This feature of the EPR spectra attested to the dimeric structure of this complex in the solid state, due to a triplet forbidden transition (ΔMS = ± 2).58 The resonances in the near half-field region were attributed to the characteristic of a rhombic symmetry and the calculated g-tensor values are given by g1 = 2.229, g2 = 2.093 and g3 = 1.985. The EPR spectrum of the polycrystalline sample of [Cu(DQPDH)]+ shows (Fig. S8†) two resonances at 307 and 328 mT, which were attributed to the interaction between the internal magnetic moment due to the unpaired electron of the complex and the external magnetic field of the spectrometer. The g-tensors for the complex [Cu(DQPDH)]+ were assigned as g⊥ = 2.05 and g‖ = 2.19. Since the observed g‖ > g⊥, it suggests that the unpaired electron is located at the dx2−y2 orbital.
Electrochemistry and catalysis
In the free ligand DQPDH2, the cyclic voltammogram exhibited an irreversible reduction wave at −1.60 V, along with a reversible reduction at E1/2 = −1.68 V vs. SCE.55 The cyclic voltammogram of [Cu(DQPD)]2 (Fig. S9†) in 95:5 (v/v) DMF/H2O showed a reversible peak at E1/2 = −0.68 V vs. SCE (Epa = −0.65 V and Epc = −0.71 V). The redox peak at −0.68 V was assigned to a metal-based CuII/CuI couple. Another reversible peak at E1/2 = −0.91 V vs. SCE (Epa = −0.88 V and Epc = −0.94 V) was attributed to a CuI/Cu0 couple.59 The ligand-based redox couple was observed at −1.66 V vs. SCE. However in the case of the mononuclear Cu complex [Cu(DQPDH)]+ (Fig. S10†), a CuII/CuI redox couple was observed at E1/2 = +0.42 V vs. SCE (Epa = +0.47 V and Epc = +0.37 V). A quasi-reversible peak at −0.25 V vs. SCE was assigned to a CuI/Cu0 redox couple.53 The ligand-based irreversible cathodic wave was observed at −0.82 and −1.67 V vs. SCE.
The electrochemical behaviour of the isolated mononuclear Cu complex [Cu(DQPDH)]+ was compared with that of the in situ generated mononuclear complex upon the iterative addition of 2 equivalents of pTsOH (Fig. 4). The redox peaks were almost the same with those of the isolated [Cu(DQPDH)]+ (Fig. S11†) (vide supra). Upon the successive addition of two equivalents or more of pTsOH, the irreversible peak at −1.50 V was shifted towards −1.45 V, which was expected due to the protonation at the non-coordinating quinoline moiety. The free ligand DQPDH2 exhibited an irreversible redox couple observed at −1.60 V along with a reversible redox couple (E1/2 = −1.68 V). The peak intensity of the CuII/CuI redox couple was almost double the observed peak intensity for the CuII/CuI couple of the dimeric complex [Cu(DQPD)]2, since two equivalents of [Cu(DQPDH)]+ are generated from 1 equivalent of [Cu(DQPD)]2. This observation clearly indicates that the dimeric [Cu(DQPD)]2 complex is cleaved into the mononuclear Cu complex under acidic conditions.
 Fig. 4  Change in the cyclic voltammogram of 0.5 mM [Cu(DQPD)]2 in the presence of varying concentrations of pTsOH (top). Evolution of the mononuclear Cu complex [Cu(DQPDH)]+ during acid titration (bottom). 
Upon the addition of AcOH (pKaDMF = 13.3) to the mononuclear Cu complex [Cu(DQPDH)]+, a significant catalytic current due to proton reduction was observed at Eonset = −1.22 V vs. SCE and an irreversible redox wave arose with a plateau current near −1.62 V vs. SCE, resulting in an onset overpotential of 440 mV (Fig. 5).55 The catalytic current increased linearly with increasing concentration of acetic acid up to 25 equivalents. Beyond this, there was no significant change in the catalytic current observed with increasing concentration of acid during the course of the reaction (Fig. S12†). It is expected that this was due to the excess concentration of (H+) that could not be exhausted during the catalytic process. A similar behaviour was also observed in the case of 0.5 mM and 1.5 mM catalyst concentrations (Fig. S13 and S14†). The evolution of H2 gas was confirmed through gas chromatography.

(Bottom) Cyclic voltammogram of 1 mM [Cu(DQPDH)]+ in the presence of varying concentrations of CH3COOH. The experimental conditions were 1.00 mM [Cu(DQPDH)]+ in DMF/H2O (95:5, v/v), 0.1 M TBAP, and at an electrochemical potential scan rate of 100 mV s−1. 
The peak current in the CuII/CuI redox couple of [Cu(DQPDH)]+ varied linearly with the square root of the scan rate (ν1/2) varying from 0.025 V to 0.4 V s−1 (Fig. S15†) as well as with the complex concentration. The diffusion coefficient was calculated using Randles–Sevcik equation: ip = 0.4463nFA[CuMonomer] (nFνD/RT)1/2(1)where n = no. of electrons, F = Faraday constant, A = surface area of the working electrode, D = diffusion coefficient, ν = scan rate, R = universal gas constant and T = temperature. According to the linear fit of the peak current (ip) vs. square root of the scan rate (ν1/2), a slope of 17.06 × 10−6 AV−1/2 s1/2 was observed (Fig. S16†). The calculated diffusion coefficient was found to be 8.25 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. The linear variation of the peak current (ip) with (ν1/2) indicated that the electrochemical process was diffusion controlled and also showed the molecular catalyst nature of the complex involved in the homogeneous catalytic process. The plot of the catalytic peak current (ic) vs. the concentration of [CuMonomer] {where CuMonomer is [Cu(DQPDH)](pTsO)} indicates that the electrochemical proton reduction is of the 1st order with respect to the catalyst, whereas the icvs. [AcOH] plot suggests a 2nd-order rate dependency (Fig. S17†). The catalytic reduction peak current (ic) was related to the catalyst and AcOH as follows:60 (2)
The ratio of the catalytic current in the presence of acetic acid (ic) to the peak current in the absence of the acid (ip) is given in Fig. S18,† which reveals that the ic/ip data are independent of the concentration of catalyst. Using the ic/ip data, the observed rate constant kobs for H2 evolution was calculated to be 111.70 s−1 using the following equation:60a (3)where n = no. of transferred of electrons, R = universal gas constant, T = temperature, F = Faraday constant, and ν = scan rate. The value of ic/ip for the complex at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 was found to be 24.
The analysis of H2 evolution was carried out at the headspace of the electrochemical cell via gas chromatography during controlled potential electrolysis. The Faradaic efficiency was then calculated by comparing the amount of H2 with the total charge passed in the system. For the catalyst [Cu(DQPDH)]+, f = 91 ± 5% was obtained in the range from −515 to −815 mV overpotential after a period of 2 h (Fig. 6).

Generally, for designing an HER catalyst, the catalyst must be stable under acidic media. To show whether the catalyst was stable or not in acidic media, time-dependent UV-Vis spectra were recorded for the [Cu(DQPDH)]+ complex in the presence of 20 equivalents of CH3COOH in 95:5 DMF/H2O (Fig. S19†). No depletion of the spectra of the complex was observed after 10 h, indicating that the catalyst [Cu(DQPDH)]+ was stable enough in the presence of 20 equivalents of CH3COOH.
The stability of the catalyst [Cu(DQPDH)]+ over the course of the electrocatalytic proton reduction was examined by UV-Vis spectroscopy before and after electrolysis (Fig. S20†) in the presence of 20 equivalents of CH3COOH in 95:5 DMF/H2O. Only a little depletion of the spectra was observed after 2 h of electrolysis at −1.6 V vs. SCE, which indicates that the catalyst did not decompose during electrolysis.
During the electrolysis process at −1.6 V vs. SCE, a significant increase in the current was observed by the injection of 20 equivalents of CH3COOH to the 5 × 10−5 M [Cu(DQPDH)]+ complex (Fig. S21†) in 95:5 DMF/H2O containing 0.1 M TBAP as the supporting electrolyte. This repeats after certain time intervals, indicating that the catalyst regenerates, but in each cycle the increase in current decreases.
FESEM and EDX analyses (Fig. S22†) of the glassy carbon plate were carried out after 2 h of the controlled potential electrolysis of [Cu(DQPDH)]+ in 95:5 DMF/H2O containing 0.1 M TBAP as a supporting electrolyte in the presence of 20 equivalents of CH3COOH at a potential of −1.6 V vs. SCE. The analysis showed that no copper was deposited on the surface of the working electrode after the electrolysis process, which indicated that the catalyst did not decompose after electrolysis.
Plausible mechanism for electrochemical proton reduction
Based on the experimental results, a plausible mechanism is proposed in Scheme 2. In the presence of 1 equivalent of pTsOH, 1/2[Cu(DQPD)]2 generates 1 mol of [Cu(DQPDH)]+. Complex [Cu(DQPDH)]+ undergoes a 1 e− reduction to form [CuI(DQPDH)]. As inferred from the cyclic voltammogram, [Cu0(DQPDH)]− is generated by the 1 e− reduction of [CuI(DQPDH)]; either by a 1 H+ coupled 1 e− transfer (PCET) path or by a step-wise reduction, followed by protonation of [Cu0(DQPDH)]− to generate [CuIH(DQPDH)]−. In the presence of H+, [CuIH(DQPDH)]− evolves H2 with the formation of [CuI(DQPDH)].

Photochemical proton reduction
Photochemical H2 production was carried out with the system containing TEA as a sacrificial electron donor, fluorescein as a chromophore, and [Cu(DQPD)]2 as a catalyst in 80:20 (v/v) DMF/H2O upon irradiation with LED light of intensity 5.88 mW cm−2 at 20 °C. The volume of H2 evolved was monitored by a differential pressure manometer connected with the photochemical reaction vessels. The evolution of H2 gas was confirmed by GC analysis at the end of photolysis. The quantum yield for [Cu(DQPD)]2 was found to be 1.9 ± 0.5% based on one photon per H2 molecule. The decomposition of the sacrificial electron donor occurs upon initial oxidation, generating an instant reducing electron such that each TEA produces two electrons for one mole of H2 production. The photoinduced electron-transfer process was studied through 1Fl* quenching by [Cu(DQPD)]2 in 80:20 (v/v) DMF/H2O (Fig. S23†). The quenching of Fl*, excited at 460 nm in fluorescence by [Cu(DQPD)]2, can be depicted using the Stern–Volmer equation. I0/I = 1 + KSV [Q](4)where I0 and I are the fluorescence intensities observed in the absence and presence of the quencher, respectively, [Q] is the quencher concentration and KSV is the Stern–Volmer quenching constant. KSV = kqτ0, where kq is the bimolecular quenching rate constant and τ0 is the excited state lifetime of fluorescein in the absence of quencher. The 1Fl* quenching rate constant kq was determined to be 1.13 × 109 M−1 s−1 from the linear fitting of the Stern–Volmer plot for [Cu(DQPD)]2, which followed a linear behaviour with the diffusion controlled limit in the order of 108 M−1 s−1 (Fig. S24†). Regarding the initial photochemical step, the electron-transfer quenching of Fl* is possible via two ways: either reductive quenching by TEA or oxidative quenching by the Cu catalyst, and from the relative concentration of the sacrificial electron donor TEA as well as the catalyst to determine the photochemical quenching path. The reported quenching rate constant for reductive quenching by TEA was 5.5 × 107 M−1 s−1.61 Even though the oxidative quenching rate constant by [Cu(DQPD)]2 was 20 times higher than that of the reductive quenching rate constant by TEA, the reductive quenching of Fl* dominated due to the much higher concentration of sacrificial electron donor TEA (0.36 M) relative to that of the Cu catalyst (4 × 10−6 M) involved in the system. The electron transfer from Fl− to the catalyst was also responsible for the robustness of the system (the excited state oxidation of Fl− was −1.51 V. vs. SCE).

Fig. 7 shows the outcome of varying the catalyst concentration on the rate and overall yield of hydrogen production. With increasing concentration of the catalyst at a constant chromophore concentration, the overall rate of hydrogen evolution and the total amount of hydrogen evolved in the system increases. The initial rate of hydrogen evolution by [Cu(DQPD)]2 was obtained by a linear fitting of each curve up to two and half hours of irradiation indicating a 1st-order dependency on the catalyst concentration for the system at a rate of 1.02 × 10−4 μmol s−1 (Fig. S25†). When the concentration of the chromophore was varied with a fixed catalyst concentration of 4 × 10−6 M, the system activity increased with increasing the chromophore concentration (Fig. S26†). The initial rate of hydrogen production showed a 1st-order dependency with respect to the chromophore concentration with a rate of 1.04 × 10−4 μmol s−1 (Fig. S27†). The complex [Cu(DQPD)]2 produced 1.15 μmol H2 per h, using a catalyst concentration of 5 × 10−6 M, corresponding to an initial TOF of 0.03 s−1 per catalyst, achieving a TON of 2135 after 20 h. The evolution of hydrogen from the photochemical reaction vessels took place in the presence of light when all the three components were present. Several blank experiments were also performed (Fig. S28–S30†) and it was confirmed that all the three components as well as light were necessary for the photochemical hydrogen evolution. Since the complex [Cu(DQPDH)]+ is converted into [Cu(DQPD)]2 in the presence of TEA or TEOA, it was not possible to use [Cu(DQPDH)]+ as a photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution under this condition. However, under an excess acidic condition (using ascorbic acid as the sacrificial electron donor), [Cu(DQPDH)]+ was decomposed; therefore acidic conditions could not be implemented for this complex. The blank experiments for the solvent in the presence of TEA and that with the catalyst [Cu(DQPD)]2 were verified under electrochemical conditions (Fig. S31†), wherein catalytic H2 evolution in the presence of the catalyst was indicated.
 Fig. 7  Hydrogen evolution on varying the concentration of the [Cu(DQPD)]2 complex in the presence of 2 mM fluorescein and [TEA] = 0.36 M in DMF/H2O (80:20, v/v). 
Photostability of the catalyst and the sensitizer
The stability of the complex in the presence of light is an important factor to carry out photochemical proton reduction. For this, the photostability of the [Cu(DQPD)]2 complex was studied by UV-Vis spectroscopy, taking 5 × 10−5 M of [Cu(DQPD)]2 complex in 80:20 DMF/H2O for 12 h (Fig. S32†). There was no significant change in the spectra of the complex after the irradiation of visible light for 12 h. This inferred that no degradation of [Cu(DQPD)]2 occurred in presence of visible light.
The photostability of the photosensitizer in the presence or absence of the catalyst was investigated through UV-Vis spectroscopy (Fig. S33†). For this purpose, two solutions were prepared: one containing Fl and TEA, another containing Fl, TEA and [Cu(DQPD)]2. It was observed that the rate of decomposition of Fl was faster in the absence of [Cu(DQPD)]2 than that in the presence of [Cu(DQPD)]2, after the irradiation of visible light for 2 h. This suggested that the catalyst protected the photosensitizer from decomposition and also that the oxidative quenching of Fl* by [Cu(DQPD)]2 stabilized the system more than that in reductive quenching by TEA.
The deactivation of the Fl/[Cu(DQPD)]2/TEA hydrogen generating system was investigated (Fig. S34†). It was observed that after irradiation for 20 h, upon the extra addition of Fl to the system, a very small amount of hydrogen was evolved, whereas in another parallel reaction, the extra addition of [Cu(DQPD)]2 led to a significant increase in hydrogen generation from the system. These observations indicated that [Cu(DQPD)]2 was deactivated in the system at a faster rate than that of Fl.
Materials and methods
Reagent grade chemicals were used in this study. Sodium hydride, 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid chloride and 8-aminoquinoline were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, and CuCl2·6H2O, p-toluenesulfonic acid were purchased from Merck, India. These chemicals were used without further purification. Solvents like diethyl ether, THF, TEA, and DMF were obtained from Merck and dried before use. The ligand DQPDH2 was prepared according to the reported procedure.55
EPR spectroscopy
The EPR spectra at 77 K were measured with a JEOL X-band spectrometer (JES-FA200) at room temperature. The g values were calibrated precisely with a Mn2+ marker, which was used as a reference. The X-band frequency was 9.44 GHz, microwave power was 1.0 mW and the amplitude was 0.1 mT.
Optical spectra
UV-Vis spectra were recorded on an Agilent 8454 Photodiode Array UV-Visible spectrophotometer. FT-IR spectral measurement was carried out on an FT-IR Affinity 1 spectrophotometer [Shimadzu-2100].
Mass spectroscopy
High-resolution ESI mass spectra were recorded on a Waters UPLC TQD (ESI MS and APCI MS), Bruker micrOTOF-Q II and Flexar SQ 300 MS (PerkinElmer, USA).
Fluorescence quenching
A stock solution (100 ml) of fluorescein at 5 × 10−8 M concentration in 80:20 DMF/H2O was prepared and degassed under N2. To 3 mL fluorescein solution taken in a quartz cuvette, 30 μL of quencher of different concentrations (2 μM, 4 μM, 6 μM, etc.) prepared in 80:20 DMF/H2O was added, and the fluorescence intensity was recorded on a PerkinElmer LS 55 Fluorescence Spectrometer upon excitation at 460 nm.
Gas evolution
The [Cu(DQPD)]2 complex was found to generate H2 in a system with fluorescein as a chromophore and TEA as the sacrificial electron donor. For these, the working and reference reaction vessels were coupled with a water circulating chiller at 20 °C along with a differential pressure manometer. In the working cell, 4 μM complex (prepared in 80:20 DMF/H2O), 2 mM fluorescein, and 0.36 M TEA (having a total volume of 2 mL) were used, whereas in the reference cell, 80:20 DMF/H2O and TEA were added, degassed with N2 and sealed with an air-tight septum. A NIKILITE visible LED light was used to irradiate the cells with light at an intensity of 5.88 mW cm−2. The resulting hydrogen evolution was scrutinized by real-time pressure change in the reaction vessels using an HTC PM 6202 differential pressure manometer, and the final amount was quantified by a gas chromatograph by injecting at the headspace. All the reactions were reiterated at least three times. The evolution of H2 gas was detected by an Agilent 7890B GC system with a TCD detector in the presence of the He as the carrier gas. All the measurements were carried out a minimum of three times and accordingly the standard deviations were calculated for the determination of TON and TOF. Further gas evolution was studied by varying the concentration of the metal complex as well as fluorescein.
Cyclic voltammetry
The ALS/Chi model 1140C electrochemical analyzer was used for all the electrochemical measurements. The experiments were carried out under an inert atmosphere at room temperature with a scan rate of 100 mV in DMF or DMF/H2O containing the supporting electrolyte Bu4NClO4 (0.1 M) and 1 mM of the copper complex. A glassy carbon, platinum wire and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were implemented as the working, auxiliary and reference electrodes, respectively. The proton reduction was carried out in electochemical conditions in the presence of acetic acid into a degassed solution of 1 mM complex in 95:5 DMF/H2O containing 0.1 M TBAP, under an inert atmosphere.
Controlled potential electrolysis
An H-type electrochemical cell was used for controlled potential electrolysis, wherein the working compartment was connected with a glassy carbon plate (1 cm2) along with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The other compartment of the cell was connected with a platinum plate of 1 cm2. The working and the counter compartments of the H-type cell were separated by a porous layer.
X-ray crystallographic analysis
The X-ray crystallographic data for the [Cu(DQPD)]2 complex were collected using a Bruker SMART APEX-CCD diffractometer with Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The collection of data, its indexing, followed by data reduction (including intensity integration, background, Lorentz and polarization corrections) and final unit cell refinements were carried out using APEX2.62 A CCD-based system was used for the collection of frames, which were processed with the SAINT software.63 The intensities of the collected data were corrected for the Lorentz and polarization effects; the absorption effects were empirically evaluated by the SADABS software and absorption correction was applied to the data.64 The crystal structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least square procedures on F2 using all the reflections (SHELXL 2015).65 All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters, whereas the hydrogen atoms were located at calculated positions with the suitable AFIX instructions using a riding model.
Experimental
Synthesis of [Cu(DQPD)]2
The Cu complex was prepared by the reaction of DQPDH2 with CuCl2·2H2O in two ways: one by deprotonating the ligand with NaH and the other without using the base.
Method 1
The ligand DQPDH2 (100 mg, 0.23 mmol) was dissolved in 5 ml DMF and added to NaH (17 mg, 0.70 mmol) for deprotonation under inert conditions. The reaction mixture was stirred for 15 min until a transparent yellow solution appeared. To this solution, CuCl2·2H2O (41 mg, 0.24 mmol) was added and stirred for 30 min, resulting in a green solution. The green-coloured precipitate was isolated using excess diethyl ether, followed by washing with ice cold methanol and diethyl ether several times. The resulting compound was dried in vacuo (86 mg; 0.089 mmol; yield = 74% per copper atom). X-ray quality green-coloured single crystals of [Cu(DQPD)]2·DMF·H2O were isolated from DMF solution by slow evaporation after three weeks. Anal. calc. for C53H39Cu2N11O6: C, 60.45; H, 3.73; N, 14.63. Found: C, 60.51; H, 3.76; N, 14.68. HRMS (ESI): Calc. for C50H30Cu2N10O4[Cu(DQPD)]2+m/z 963.13 found 963.11; calc. for C25H15CuN5O2Na m/z 503.05 found 503.04 and Calc. for C25H16CuN5O2m/z 481.07 found 481.06; IR (KBr, cm−1, selected peaks):1632 (ν, CO).
Method 2
The ligand DQPDH2 (200 mg, 0.48 mmol) was dissolved in 1:1 (v/v) CHCl3/MeOH medium and drop-wise added to a pre-dissolved 5 mL methanolic solution of CuCl2·2H2O (81.4 mg, 0.48 mmol). The green-coloured solution was left stirring overnight under ambient conditions and evaporated in vacuo to obtain a green precipitate. The precipitates were recrystallized from methanol and excess diethyl ether several times (160 mg; 0.17 mmol; yield = 70% per copper atom). The green compound was crystallized in DCM by slow evaporation to obtain a suitable green crystal after two days, and the parameters and the structure of the complex were similar to those of the one crystallized from method 1.
Synthesis of [Cu(DQPDH)](pTSO)
The green-coloured binuclear Cu complex [Cu(DQPD)]2 (100 mg, 0.10 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of 95:5 (v/v) DMF/H2O. To this solution, 2 equivalents of pTsOH (79 mg, 0.42 mmol), pre-dissolved in 5 mL 95:5 (v/v) DMF/H2O, was added and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature under inert conditions. The colour of the solution changed from green to yellowish green and was precipitated by excess diethyl ether. The isolated compound was dried in vacuo and recrystallized from methanol and excess diethyl ether several times (60 mg; 0.092 mmol; yield = 92% per copper atom). Anal. calc. for C32H23CuN5O5S: C, 58.84; H, 3.55; N, 10.72; S, 4.91. Found: C, 58.92; H, 3.59; N, 10.76, S, 4.99. HRMS (ESI): calc. for C25H16CuN5O2[Cu(DQPDH)]+m/z 481.07; found 481.06. IR (KBr, cm−1, selected peaks): 1630 (ν, CO).
Conclusions
In conclusion, the neutral binuclear copper complex [Cu(DQPD)]2, in which each of the copper centre is coordinated through an octahedral geometry through a pyridine bridge of the dianionic DQPD ligand, was synthesized. The double-helical coordinated [Cu(DQPD)]2 complex was converted to the mononuclear form with the addition of two equivalents of pTsOH. The interconversion between the binuclear and mononuclear copper complexes was studied through UV-Vis spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry techniques. The mononuclear copper complex underwent electrochemical proton reduction to generate hydrogen from the external proton source acetic acid in 95:5 (v/v) DMF/H2O medium with an acid independent rate constant (TOF) of 111.70 s−1 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at 25 °C. The catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency f = 91 ± 5% in the range of −515 to −815 mV overpotential after a period of 2 h of controlled potential electrolysis. The complex was highly stable towards the acid as inferred from the FESEM and EDX analyses during the controlled potential electrolysis. The [Cu(DQPD)]2 complex also behaved as an active hydrogen evolving catalyst under the irradiation of visible light with fluorescein (Fl) as a photosensitizer and triethylamine (TEA) as the sacrificial electron donor and water as the source of protons. The initial electron-transfer quenching path from the Fl* excited state took place by TEA because the concentration of TEA was much greater than that of the [Cu(DQPD)]2 complex used in the photocatalytic system. The photocatalytic system displayed very high activity, achieving 2135 turnovers after 20 h with initial TOF of 0.03 s−1 with respect to the catalyst.
