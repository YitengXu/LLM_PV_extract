    , Accepted 3rd September 2014First published on 5th September 2014AbstractAlmost all types of solar cells suffer from a decreased power output when the incident light is tilted away from normal since the incident intensity generally follows a cosine law of the incident angle. Making use of the blue shift nature of the Bragg position of a TiO2 nanotube photonic crystal (NT PC) under oblique incidence, we demonstrate experimentally that the use of the NT PC can partially compensate the cosine power loss of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The strategy used here is to purposely choose the Bragg position of the NT PC to be at the longer wavelength side of the dye absorption peak. When the incident light is tilted, the blue shift of the Bragg position results in more overlap with the dye absorption peak, generating a higher efficiency that partially compensates the reduced photon flux due to light inclination. Moreover, the unique structure of the vertically aligned TiO2 nanotubes contributes an additional scattering effect when the incident light is tilted. As a result, the power output of a DSSC coupled with the NT PC layer shows a much flatter angular dependence than a DSSC without the NT PC. At all the incident angles, the DSSC coupled with the NT PC layer also shows a higher power conversion efficiency than the one without. The concept of using NT PC to mitigate the angular dependence of DSSCs can be easily extended to many other optoelectronic devices that are irradiance sensitive.
Introduction
To meet the crucial challenge of depleting fossil fuels, photovoltaics (PV) as one of the renewable energy sources are gradually being used on a global scale and in a variety of forms.1–4 A common problem with all types of PVs is that they are irradiance sensitive which results in a decay of the power output when the incident light is tilted. While a sophisticated sunlight tracking system may solve the problem, it is expensive and consumes energy. Although many light management techniques, such as the use of scattering layers, plasmonic nanometals, superstructures and photonic crystals,5–8 can enhance the power conversion efficiency, they in general do make the power output of a solar cell less irradiance sensitive.
Integrating photonic crystal (PC) structures in photovoltaics, as an effective light trapping method, has gained increasing interest and led to significant enhancement of power conversion efficiencies in various types of solar cells, such as silicon solar cells,9,10 quantum dot-sensitized solar cells,11,12 perovskite-based solar cells,13 organic solar cells,14,15 and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).16 Typically, for PC based DSSCs, a bi-layered architecture consisting of an absorbing layer (normally ruthenium dye sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2) and an additional underlying PC layer (such as SiO2/TiO2 multi-layers,17–19 TiO2 inverse opal layers,20–22 and TiO2 nanotube PC membranes23,24) has been adopted to efficiently harvest the solar irradiation. The use of PC is regarded as a promising way to enhance light harvesting in DSSCs by confining or slowing down light at certain wavelength range, which are caused by several possible effects, i.e., reflecting the unabsorbed photons back to the absorbing layer, suppressing group velocities of photons and creating resonant modes.25,26 Particularly, for the TiO2 nanotube PC (NT PC) coupled DSSCs, it has been demonstrated that the light harvesting enhancement effect strongly depends on how well the Bragg reflection peak of the NT PC is matched to the dye absorption spectrum.23,24
Here, we propose a strategy to reduce the angular dependence of DSSCs by coupling the photoanodes to TiO2 NT PC structures. The reduced angular dependence of the power output is resulting from two mechanisms: (1) the Bragg position of the NT PC is purposely chosen to be located at the longer wavelength side of the dye absorption peak. When the incident light is tilted, the Bragg peak will blue shift, having more overlap with the dye absorption peak, and hence harvest more efficiently the incident light that partially compensates the reduced photon flux due to light inclination; and (2) when the incident light is tilted, the photons will encounter more interfaces between the walls of nanotubes and be scattered. The enhanced light scattering also compensates the power loss due to the reduced photon flux. The angular dependence of the optical properties of the TiO2 NT PC structure and its effect on the photovoltaic performance of the integrated solar cells has been systematically studied in the present work. The effect of the lattice constant of the NT PC structure on the suppression of the angular dependence of the power output has been studied by both experimental measurements and theoretical simulations. It is found that the introduction of TiO2 NT PC not only stabilizes the power output under oblique illumination, but also enhances light harvesting at all the incident angles studied. It is believed that the idea developed in the current work is also applicable to a variety of optoelectronic devices that are irradiance sensitive.
Experimental
Fabrication of TiO2 NT PC
The TiO2 NT PCs were synthesized by periodic current-pulse anodization following the same experimental procedure reported in our previous work.24 By using different pulse durations and number of pulses, TiO2 NT PCs with various lattice constants were obtained, namely, 120-NT PC, 150-NT PC, 190-NT PC and 230-NT PC (the number stands for the lattice constant in nanometers). In brief, ammonium fluoride (0.5 wt%) was dissolved in an aqueous EG solution (3 vol% DI water in EG) by stirring for 2 h and used as the electrolyte for all anodization processes. Unless stated otherwise, all the chemicals were purchased from International Laboratory (USA) and used as received. After 15 min anodization at 60 V in a two-electrode electrochemical cell, the titanium foils (99.7%, Strem Chemical) were ultrasonically processed and subsequently rinsed with DI water to remove the anodic TiO2 nanotubes produced in this anodization step. In order to fabricate TiO2 NT PC, a second anodization was carried out on the pre-treated titanium foil, using periodic current pulses with alternating high current density (so determined to obtain an anodization voltage of ∼60 V) and low current density (0 A in this study). Different high current pulse durations (20, 30, 40 and 50 s) were used to obtain NT PCs with different lattice constants (120, 150, 190 and 230 nm, respectively) while the thickness of different NT PCs was kept at ∼2.3 μm. The as-anodized foil was further heat treated at 270 °C for 1 h, followed by a third anodization at 60 V for 2 h to remove the TiO2 NT PC membrane from the Ti substrate. For comparison, a TiO2 NT membrane with similar thickness and nanotube diameter was also synthesized by a fixed voltage (60 V) anodization in the second step.
Preparation and assembly of DSSCs
The materials for constructing DSSCs, including TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) paste (13 nm), FTO glass (Nippon Sheet Glass), Pt-coated FTO glass, thermal adhesive film (25 μm thick, Surlyn-1702), N719 dye (Solaronix) and the electrolyte (DMPD: 1.0 M, LiI: 0.1 M, 4-TBP: 0.5 M, I2: 0.12 M, and 3-methoxy propionitrile) were purchased from Wuhan Geao Instruments Science and Technology Co. Ltd (China). The photoanode was fabricated by adhering TiO2 NT PC membranes on to the FTO substrate which had already been coated with a TiO2 NP paste layer, using a doctor-blade method.24 After annealing at 450 °C for 3 h with heating and cooling rates of 1 °C min−1, the photoanodes were immersed in 0.3 mM N719 dye (cis-bis(isothiocyanato)-bis(2,20-bipyridyl-4,-40-dicarboxylate) dissolved in ethanol at 60 °C for 24 h. The excess dye was washed away with ethanol. For comparison, TiO2 NP photoanodes were also prepared as a reference in this study. A thermal adhesive film was used as a spacer to be sandwiched between the photoanode and a Pt counter electrode. The single cell is completed by infiltrating the liquid electrolyte into the cavity of the active area of cell and sealing with UV epoxy. For each type of cell, more than 4 samples were fabricated and characterized.
Characterization of the photoanodes and DSSCs
The microstructures of the NT PCs and photoanodes were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL JSM-6335F). The optical properties of the photoanodes were characterized using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Model UV-2550, Shimadzu, Japan), with a sample rotation holder for angular measurements. The I–V curves were measured using a Newport 91160 solar-light simulator with an AM 1.5 filter. The incident light power was calibrated using a silicon photodiode previously calibrated at 100 mW cm−2. In order to avoid spurious light influence, a black mask was used to wrap around the TiO2 electrode and its lateral sides. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was recorded using a Newport 2931-C power meter, as a function of wavelength from 400 to 800 nm (tuned with a Newport 74125 monochromator) with the light source from a Newport 66902 solar simulator. The light intensity was measured using a Newport 2931-C power meter equipped with a 71675_71580 detector probe. For the photovoltaic characterization under titled sunlight, a sample rotation holder was used again.
Simulation and theoretical calculation
Finite-element full wave simulation was employed for both the reflection and absorption spectra simulation. In the simulation, the incoming light first incident on the conductive transparent substrate (refractive index = 1.45). Then it successively passes through a 10 μm thick TiO2 NP layer with 50% porosity (the effective refractive index nnp = 2.03), the TiO2 NT PC or NT layer with a thickness ∼2.3 μm (the refractive index nTiO2 = 2.51), and finally reaches the electrolyte with a refractive index of nelectrolyte = 1.403, corresponding to the propionitrile electrolyte.25 The refractive indices of the TiO2 NP layer were calculated by the effective medium theory, assuming that the electrolyte fills all the pores. The NT PC and NT layers were modeled in a hexagonal lattice with the geometry similar to the experimental samples and the NTs arranged in the electrolyte with the axial direction of the NTs perpendicular to the cell surface. All TiO2 layers, including NP, NT, and NT PC, were sensitized by a ruthenium dye, whose absorption coefficient is obtained by fitting the photocurrent and the absorptance spectra of similar layer and device and is represented by the frequency-dependent imaginary part of the refractive index. Finally, the estimated photocurrent enhancement ΔJsc was calculated using the following equation:27 (1)where LHEpc and LHEref are the light harvesting efficiencies of the NT PC based DSSC and the reference cell, respectively, which are defined as the fraction of incident light intensity absorbed by the dye in the devices. F(λ) is the photon flux as a function of wavelength λ, which is calculated from the standard AM1.5G solar spectral irradiance.28
Results and discussion
The designed architecture of the NT PC based solar cells, consisting of a 10 μm thick TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) layer and a thin TiO2 NT PC layer with the thickness around 2.3 μm, is illustrated in Fig. 1a and b. In this architecture, the thick TiO2 NP layer acts as the absorbing layer and the thin TiO2 NT PC layer acts as a Bragg mirror to reflect the unabsorbed photons back to the absorbing layer. In order to reveal the interplay between the angular optical properties of the NT PC and the photovoltaic properties of the integrated devices, NT PCs with four lattice constants, i.e., 120, 150, 190 and 230 nm, were produced by periodic current-pulse anodization and subsequently coupled to the TiO2 NP layer, as shown in Fig. 1b–f. The Bragg positions of the NT PCs with the three longest lattice parameters were located in the visible range, at about 450, 550, and 640 nm, respectively. For comparison, a reference cell consisting of only a TiO2 NP layer (∼12 μm in thickness) and a TiO2 NT/NP cell with a smooth nanotube layer instead of the NT PC layer (of similar thickness) are shown in Fig. S1.†

To investigate the effect of both the smooth NT and the NT PC on the angle dependent optical properties of the photoanode, the transmittance spectra of various types of photoanodes were characterized in air and under varying incident angles from 0 to 50°, as shown in Fig. 2. The tilting of the incident angle is found to shift the absorption edge to a shorter wavelength for all NT PCs, which is consistent with the blue shift of the Bragg position, as seen from the simulated reflectance spectrum (Fig. S2 a–d†). According to Bragg's law, λpeak = 2dneffsinθ (where d is the lattice constant of the NT PC, neff is the effective refractive index, and θ is the angle between the incident light and the periodic planes),29 the Bragg peak λpeak should blue shift as the incident angle increases (incident angle = 90° − θ). This phenomenon can be easily observed by naked eyes, as shown in Fig. S3,† where the color of the photoanode turns from green to dark purple when the photoanode is tilted at a large angle. It is also noted that according to Bragg's law, the peak shift is more significant as d is increased (∼45, 65 and 75 nm for 150-NT PC, 190-NT PC and 230-NT PC, respectively, calculated from Fig. S2†), implying a stronger angular dependence of the optical properties of the devices under a longer lattice constant. In addition, since the Bragg position of the 120-NT PC is located in the ultraviolet range and shifts to even shorter wavelength when the sample is tilted, no visible wavelength shift of the 120-NT PC/TiO2 NP photoanode can be seen in Fig. 2c.

At the same time, the transmittance of all photoanodes gradually decreases as the sample is tilted, which is the consequence of stronger reflectance at the air–glass interface. However, it can also be seen from Fig. 2 that, compared to the TiO2 NP based photoanode, the decline in transparency of the TiO2 NT PC/TiO2 NP and TiO2 NT/TiO2 NP photoanodes is more significant as the sample is titled. This is attributed to the additional enhanced diffuse scattering from the walls of nanotubes when the light is deviated from the axial direction of the nanotubes. This result agrees well with the simulated reflectance spectra of the TiO2 NT photoanode (Fig. S2e†), where the oscillation of the reflection spectrum becomes stronger in intensity with increasing incident angles. It is believed that this unique scattering effect of NTs will assist the PC structure to compensate an energy loss due to the tilting of incident sunlight.
In order to demonstrate the angular effect of TiO2 NT PCs on the photovoltaic performance of the assembled cells under different incident angles, the photocurrent vs. voltage curves were measured under simulated sunlight of AM1.5G, as shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that under different incident angles, the curve shapes are similar with slightly changed open circuit voltages and fill factors, whereas the short circuit current, Jsc, of all the cells decreases with incident angles due to the reduced incident irradiation, Iθ = I0cosθ (where Iθ is the incident intensity of sunlight at an incident angle θ)19,30 The I–V curves of the TiO2 NP based reference cell and the TiO2 NT/TiO2 NP cell are also displayed in Fig. S4.† A careful examination shows that, although in general Jsc decreases with increasing incident angles for all the cells, the decreasing trends are different for cells coupled with different TiO2 NT PCs, indicating a complex angular response of the integrated cells.

To clarify the angular response of the photocurrent efficiency of the solar cells based on different types of photoanodes, a detailed analysis on the variation of Jsc as a function of incident angle (0–60°) is conducted in Fig. 4a. It can be seen that the introduction of NT PC increases the photocurrent for all the measured incident angles from 0 to 60°. Under normal incidence, the preferred PC structure to get the maximum photocurrent is 150-NT PC, which is consistent with our previous work, and the photocurrent enhancement effect has been ascribed to the strong overlap between the Bragg reflection peak of the NT PC and the absorption peak of the dye.23,24 However, when the incident angle is increased, the difference in photocurrent enhancement among different cells becomes smaller. Fig. 4b shows the normalized Jsc (normalized with respect to the short circuit current under normal incidence). It can be seen that, as compared to the TiO2 NP reference cell and the cosine loss curve, the Jsc drop due to the increased incident angle becomes less for the TiO2 NT cell, which is attributed to the additional scattering effect of nanotubes when the incoming light deviates away from the axial direction of NTs. Such a drop in photocurrent can be further suppressed by the introduction of 190-NT PC or 230-NT PC, whose Bragg peak is located on the red side of the dye absorption peak. As the incident angle is increased, the Bragg peak blue shifts and results in an increased overlap with the dye absorption peak, inducing a greater percentage enhancement in photocurrent (Fig. 4c). This photocurrent compensation effect makes the photovoltaic performance of the cells less sensitive to the variation of the sunlight incident angle, an attractive feature for practical applications of all types of solar cells. In other words, for a given allowable variation of the power output, the working range of the incident angle is widened. For example, if a 20% drop in photocurrent is allowed in a practical application, the working range of the incident angle is 0–40° for the reference TiO2 NP cell, while it is 0–50° for the 230-NT PC cell (Fig. 4b). For the case of 120-NT PC and 150-NT PC, whose Bragg peak will move away from the dye absorption peak with increasing incident angles, the photocurrent compensation effect is mainly contributed by the increasing scattering effect of the NTs. The unique combination of the PC and the scattering effects of the NT PC structure allow us to have a better design of the photoanode structure for a more stable power output of solar cells under tilted sunlight, an important issue to be considered for practical applications.
 Fig. 4  Angular dependence of (a) Jsc, (b) normalized Jsc and cosine curve (dark blue line), and (c) Jsc enhancement (as compared to the reference cell) for different types of cells. 
The photocurrent compensation effect is further revealed in Fig. 4c, which illustrates the angular evolution of photocurrent enhancement, ΔJsc, of different types of NT and NT PC based solar cells, as compared to the NP reference cells. It can be found that the 190-NT PC and 230-NT PC cells have the most significant angular dependence of ΔJsc, due to both the PC effect (blue shift of the Bragg peak to have more overlap with the dye absorption peak) and the scattering effect. While for the 120-NT PC and 150-NT PC cells, ΔJsc is less sensitive to the incident angles due to the decaying PC effect, i.e., the Bragg peak is blue shifted to have less overlap with the dye absorption peak. A moderate angular dependence of ΔJsc is found in the TiO2 NT cell since there is only the scattering effect, and no PC effect.
The power conversion efficiency shows similar evolution to that of Jsc, as shown in Fig. S5,† with minor deviations caused by a slightly and oppositely changed open circuit voltage and fill factor with respect to the incident angles (Fig. S6†).
The origin and underlying mechanism of the angular dependence of the photocurrent enhancement effect of NT PCs can be further visualized and confirmed in the simulated absorptance spectra and the experimental incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE). Two incident angles, 0 and 50° are compared in Fig. 5. Two different effects, namely, the Bragg mirror effect of PC and the scattering effect of the wall of NT, will play their roles in the photocurrent enhancement. Specifically, for 120-NT PC and 150-NT PC, whose Bragg position is located at the short wavelength side or very close to the dye absorption peak under normal incidence, the tilting of incident angle will shift the Bragg position to even shorter wavelength and hence increase the IPCE on the blue side of the dye absorption peak. For 190-NT PC and 230-NT PC, the tilting of incident angle will move the Bragg position closer to the dye absorption peak and hence increase the IPCE on the red side. In contrast, the scattering effect on the walls of NTs enhances the IPCE in the whole spectrum range, as can be seen from the simulated absorption spectra of TiO2 NT coupled DSSC (Fig. S7†). These results are in good agreement with the afore-mentioned angular response of photocurrent of those TiO2 NT PC coupled DSSCs. The ΔJsc calculated from the simulated absorptance of cells using eqn (1) is displayed in Fig. 6, which agrees well with the experimental results (Fig. 4c).

All the experimental spectra are normalized at a wavelength of 530 nm. The curves from an NP-based reference DSSC are also plotted for comparison. The vertical dashed lines show the Bragg positions at the incident angle of 0 and 50°.

Fig. 7 shows the simulated 2D electric field distribution in each layer of DSSC coupled with 190-NT PC under an incident angle of 0° and 50° for two selected wavelengths. It can be seen from Fig. 7 that, for the wavelength of 640 nm, the Bragg mirror behavior of the NT PC causes a rapid electric field reduction in the PC layer and a strong electric field localization in the NP absorbing layer. This phenomenon disappears when the incident angle is increased to 50°, due to the blue shift of the Bragg position of the NT PC. However, as shown in Fig. 7d, this phenomenon reappears at a shorter wavelength of 590 nm, when the incident angle is 50°.

Conclusions
The angular response of the optical properties of TiO2 NT PC and the performances of the corresponding integrated DSSCs were systemically studied. We have demonstrated that the introduction of TiO2 NT PC with various lattice constants, ranging from 120 to 230 nm not only produces a significant photocurrent enhancement under normal incident light, but also maintains a stable power output when the incident light is tilted from 0° to 60°. The angular dependence of the enhancement effect and the photocurrent revealed a distinct evolution, which has been discussed with both experimental and simulated methods. For the TiO2 NT PCs with a Bragg position at the blue side of the dye absorption peak, the angular evolution of Jsc shows a trend similar to that of the TiO2 NP based DSSCs, due to the compromise between a weaker peak overlap (overlap of the Bragg and dye absorption peaks) and a stronger light scattering; whereas, for the TiO2 NT PCs with a Bragg position on the red side, both the stronger peak overlap and the light scattering lead to a slower drop in Jsc with respect to the incident angle. Our results showed that, by making use of the blue shift of the Bragg peak and the enhanced light scattering from TiO2 NT PC under oblique incidence, the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs can be made less sensitive to irradiance, an attractive feature for applications. It is believed that our work presented here offers new insight and guidance to the design and application of photonic crystals to optoelectronic devices that are irradiance sensitive.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic structure of DSSC based on the TiO2 NT PC/TiO2 NP photoanode. (b) Cross-sectional SEM image of the TiO2 NT PC/TiO2 NP photoanode. (c–f) Cross-sectional SEM images of NT PCs with different lattice constants: (c) 120 nm, (d) 150 nm, (e) 190 nm, and (f) 230 nm. The scale bar measures 100 nm.	 

 	Fig. 2  Experimental transmission spectra of studied photoanodes under varying incident angles from 0 to 50°, (a) the TiO2 NP based photoanode, (b) the TiO2 NT/TiO2 NP based photoanode, and the photoanodes based on TiO2 NT PCs with different lattice constants: (c) 120 nm, (d) 150 nm, (e) 190 nm, and (f) 230 nm.	 

 	Fig. 3  The evolution of photocurrent–voltage curves of DSSCs made of a 10 μm-thick TiO2 NP electrode coupled to different TiO2 NT PCs: (a) 120-NT PC, (b) 150-NT PC, (c) 190-NT PC, (d) 230-NT PC, as the incident angle increases from 0 to 60°, in a step of 5°.	 

 	Fig. 4  Angular dependence of (a) Jsc, (b) normalized Jsc and cosine curve (dark blue line), and (c) Jsc enhancement (as compared to the reference cell) for different types of cells.	 

 	Fig. 5  Numerical simulated absorptance (top figure) and normalized IPCE (bottom figure) of the DSSCs coupled with different TiO2 NT PCs, under different incident angles (top figure: 0–60° in a step of 5°; bottom figure: 0 and 50°): (a) 120-NT PC, (b) 150-NT PC, (c) 190-NT PC and (d) 230-NT PC. All the experimental spectra are normalized at a wavelength of 530 nm. The curves from an NP-based reference DSSC are also plotted for comparison. The vertical dashed lines show the Bragg positions at the incident angle of 0 and 50°.	 

 	Fig. 6  The calculated ΔJsc (according to eqn (1)) of different types of DSSCs, as a function of incident angle.	 

 	Fig. 7  The simulated 2D distribution of the electric field in each layer of DSSC coupled with 190-NT PC under the incident angle of 0 and 50° for two selected wavelengths. The incident angle and wavelength used in each graph are (a) 0°, 640 nm; (b) 0°, 590 nm; (c) 50°, 640 nm; and (d) 50°, 590 nm, respectively.
