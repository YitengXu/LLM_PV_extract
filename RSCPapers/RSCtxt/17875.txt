    , Accepted 3rd March 2017First published on 3rd March 2017AbstractHere, a low-temperature solution-processed nickel oxide (NiOx) thin film was first employed as a hole transport layer in both inverted (p-i-n) planar and regular (n-i-p) mesoscopic organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). In p-i-n PVSCs, the wetting properties, perovskite morphology, absorption and hole extraction process can be significantly enhanced with a suitable surface treatment, resulting in a significantly increased fill factor (from 0.684 to 0.742) and short circuit current density (from 16.73 to 20.66 mA cm−2). On the basis of the treated NiOx thin film, a promising power conversion efficiency of 15.9% with negligible hysteresis was obtained for inverted planar PVSCs, and 11.8% was obtained for the flexible devices. More importantly, the presynthesized NiOx can be directly deposited on the perovskite film as a top hole transport layer without decomposing the perovskite in n-i-p PVSCs. The resulting n-i-p device shows a five-fold improvement in power conversion efficiency when compared with a hole transport material free device, which indicates that this solution-processed NiOx is promising for all-inorganic charge selection layer based, stable and low cost PVSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have drawn considerable attention because of their outstanding opto-electronic properties, solution processability and increased power conversion efficiency.1–4 Since Miyasaka and co-workers first introduced perovskite materials into the photovoltaic community, different device configurations including mesoscopic and planar architecture based devices have been reported.1,2,5–7 Recently, a remarkable highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.1% has been demonstrated based on mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), whose theoretical limit has been estimated to be 31%.8,9 However, mesoscopic PVSCs usually employ a high temperature sintered mesoscopic layer as a scaffold, which will increase the fabrication cost and limit their compatibility with flexible substrates.10 An alternative structure is the planar configuration, namely a simple n-i-p (regular) or p-i-n (inverted) structure, where the entire device can be fabricated at low temperature.6,7 Remarkably, both regular and inverted planar PVSCs have shown efficiencies over 19%,11 with gradually improved device stability.12–14 In planar devices, the charge transport materials play a vital role in selective electron/hole extraction, where an ideal charge transport material should possess a suitable energy level, sufficient conductivity, and good charge extraction capacity. In the pursuit of highly stable and low-cost PVSCs, devices with an all-inorganic charge transport layer appear to be promising. However, there is limited success with low temperature processed inorganic transport materials, particularly hole transport materials, that have satisfactory thermal/chemical compatibility with perovskite materials.
Hole transport materials have a great impact on efficient hole extraction in PVSCs, as well as the long term stability of the devices. For instance, nickel oxide (NiOx) has been demonstrated to be an efficient bottom hole transport layer (HTL) in inverted mesoscopic PVSCs15–18 or a top HTL in regular mesoporous carbon electrode based PVSCs.19–22 In inverted planar PVSCs, a great deal of progress has been made by using thin film NiOx as a HTL.12,13,23–33 However, nearly all the reported solution processed NiOx HTLs were prepared by employing a sol–gel precursor solution or nanoparticles that are dispersed in water or strongly polar organic solvents, and a high temperature thermal annealing process (250–300 °C or higher) was frequently required in some cases. These types of solution processed NiOx HTLs show great promise in inverted perovskite devices; however, it is very challenging to directly deposit NiOx hole transport materials on the top of the perovskite layer in regular n-i-p devices. Therefore, it is of critical importance to explore a general and facile approach to fabricate NiOx hole transport materials that possess excellent band alignment and thermal/chemical compatibility with perovskite materials.12,34,35
For the first time, a low-temperature solution-processed NiOx thin film composed of pre-synthesized NiOx was successfully employed as a hole transport layer in both regular (n-i-p) and inverted (p-i-n) planar organic–inorganic hybrid PVSCs. The deposited perovskite morphology, the perovskite/NiOx interfaces, and the corresponding carrier dynamics can be tuned with a suitable surface treatment of the NiOx thin film, resulting in a much enhanced fill factor and short circuit current density. On the basis of the optimized NiOx thin film, a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.9% was obtained based on an indium tin oxide (ITO)/NiOx/perovskite/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag configuration, and a PCE of 11.8% was obtained for the planar PVSCs with a PEN/ITO substrate. More importantly, the attempt on the employment of NiOx in the regular structure with a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2/perovskite/NiOx/Au configuration shows a PCE of 9.11%, which is a five-fold improvement in power conversion efficiency when compared with that of a hole transport material free device (1.81%) with a FTO/TiO2/perovskite/Au configuration. This indicates the promise of nanocrystal based NiOx HTLs in the development of the regular structure. This work represents a significant step in the exploration of all-inorganic charge selection layer-based stable PVSCs in both regular and inverted device configurations.
Results and discussion
The robust NiOx nanocrystals were prepared by a simple non-injection thermolysis method with ligand protection.36 We characterized the crystallinity of the obtained NiOx nanocrystals with X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 1a, the as-synthesized NiOx nanocrystals exhibit diffraction peaks at 36.9, 42.9, and 62.2°, which can be assigned to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of NiOx, respectively, indicating a rock salt crystalline structure. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images in Fig. 1b and c show that the as-synthesized NiOx nanoparticles possess a particle size of about 5 nm, with clear lattice fringes, indicating their high crystallinity feature. The inter-planar distances of 0.21 nm and 0.24 nm can be indexed to the (200) and (111) planes of NiOx, respectively, further confirming the rock salt crystalline structure, and the non-preferable growth. By capping the surface of NiOx with stearate ligands, the obtained NiOx crystals can be well-dispersed in chlorobenzene, which enables the subsequent deposition of the NiOx thin film on an ITO substrate via spin-coating. We also used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterize the morphology and surface properties of the NiOx thin film. As shown in Fig. 1d, the NiOx thin film on ITO shows a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 3.43 nm, which suggests that a very uniform NiOx thin film was obtained.

The above NiOx film composed of pre-synthesized nanocrystals was further used as a hole transport material to verify its compatibility with perovskite films. The perovskite film with good crystallinity, full surface coverage, and controllable optoelectronic properties has been regarded as one of the most important factors that govern the device performance of the resulting PVSC.37–41 Here, we deposited a perovskite film on the NiOx film via a two-step spin-coating method according to a previous report.42 We first carried out scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization to investigate the morphology of the perovskite layer on the NiOx film. The top view SEM images of the perovskite film deposited on the pristine NiOx film are shown in Fig. 2, and the images of PEDOT:PSS based samples are also presented for comparison. It was found that the perovskite film deposited on the PEDOT:PSS substrate shows full coverage of the substrate, while for the NiOx case, a certain amount of small pinholes were observed, which is unfavorable for the final device performance. In order to obtain a better perovskite film with full surface coverage on the NiOx substrate (denoted as NiOx), we conducted UV-O3 (UVO) treatment on the pristine NiOx (denoted as NiOx-UVO) to modify the surface wetting properties. As shown in Fig. S1,† the pristine NiOx shows a contact angle (with DMF) of 40.8°; after 5 minutes of UVO treatment, the contact angle decreased dramatically to 22.5°. The decreased wetting angle of the NiOx-UVO film with DMF suggests that the removal of surface ligands on the NiOx is achieved by the UVO treatment. We also conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on nickel oxide films with/without UVO treatment. The decreased peak intensity of the C element (Fig. S2a†) and increased peak intensity ratio of C–O, O–CO vs. C–C (Fig. S2h†) after UVO treatment confirmed the removal of surface ligands on the UVO treated NiOx film. In addition, the increased peak intensity of –OH (Fig. S2d†) and enlarged peak intensity ratio of Ni3+ (NiOOH)/Ni2+ (NiO) suggest that induced hydroxyl groups are formed in the NiOx-UVO film, which may benefit the adhesion/interaction between the perovskite and the hole transporting layer.43 With enhanced wetting properties, the perovskite film shows full surface coverage of the NiOx substrate without pinholes as shown in Fig. 2c. In addition, the enhanced X-ray diffraction peak intensity of the perovskite on NiOx-UVO or PEDOT:PSS substrates (Fig. S3†) indicates the enhanced crystallinity of the perovskite film, which is consistent with the SEM results. The improved film morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite film are believed to benefit the resulting device.

The work function of the pristine NiOx film and NiOx-UVO film was measured via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), to ensure an excellent band alignment with the perovskite. As shown in Fig. S4,† the work function of the NiOx film and NiOx-UVO film was measured to be −5.24 and −5.35 eV, respectively. From the electrical point of view, the changed work function of the NiOx film indicates its different defect levels, where Ni3+ was usually formed by UVO and the increase of the concentration of Ni3+ (confirmed by the XPS spectra in Fig. S2f†) can enhance the conductivity of the NiOx film, which may lead to a reduced series resistance in solar cells.44 In addition, UVO treatment usually introduces hydroxyl groups on the surface of thin films, which may be helpful for the connection of the under layer and the perovskite layer that reduces their contact resistance.43,44 From the perspective of band alignment, the work function of NiOx-UVO is closer to the valence band of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV); the Fermi level difference between the work function of NiOx-UVO (−5.35 eV) and the work function of the perovskite should be lower than that of pristine NiOx (−5.24 eV). As a result, a better band alignment was formed after the UVO treatment which should benefit the charge transfer from the perovskite to NiOx.
To demonstrate the NiOx films as an efficient HTL in PVSCs, we fabricated devices with a configuration of ITO/NiOx/PVSCs/PCBM/BCP/Ag by employing both pristine NiOx and NiOx-UVO as HTLs, respectively. Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of NiOx based devices and NiOx-UVO based devices under standard one sun AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation. The NiOx based device exhibits an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.04 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 16.73 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.684, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.0% (Table 1). When replacing the HTL with NiOx-UVO, the device exhibits a VOC of 1.03 V, an increased JSC of 20.66 mA cm−2, and an increased FF of 0.742, resulting in a PCE of 15.9%, leading to a 32.5% increase of the PCE of the pristine NiOx based device. In addition, it was found that the NiOx-UVO based devices show a lower series resistance than that of the pristine NiOx based devices from the slope of the J–V curve near the open-circuit voltage, which may be attributed to the increased conductivity of NiOx-UVO and enhanced contact of the perovskite and NiOx by UVO treatment, leading to an increased fill factor from 0.684 to 0.742. The histograms of the power conversion efficiency and stabilized output of the NiOx-UVO and NiOx devices are shown in Fig. S5,† which also indicate that the former possesses a much better device performance. We also measured the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of NiOx and NiOx-UVO based devices as shown in Fig. 3b. It is observed that the NiOx-UVO based device shows a different IPCE curve shape and a much higher IPCE value in the range of 300–800 nm when compared with NiOx based devices. As a result, the integrated JSC values of the NiOx-UVO and NiOx based devices are 20.6 and 16.3 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in line with the J–V measurements. The UV-Vis spectra of the perovskite layer on NiOx-UVO and NiOx films are shown in Fig. 2d, the former shows a much higher absorbance in the range of 350–600 nm. Combining the UV-Vis and IPCE results, the significant improvement of photocurrent density by replacing pristine NiOx with NiOx-UVO could be attributed to the enhanced light absorption, perovskite crystallinity and film quality, which lead to the reduction of pinholes and trap states. In addition, the NiOx-UVO devices possess a much higher IPCE value in the range of 600–800 nm than the NiOx based devices. In these devices, the irradiated short wavelength light is mainly absorbed by the perovskite near the NiOx side, and the long wavelength light is mainly absorbed by the perovskite near the PCBM side. As a result, the holes generated by the long wavelength light diffused from the PCBM side to the NiOx/perovskite interface to be collected. Considering that PCBM usually shows more efficient charge extraction than that of NiOx, NiOx/perovskite interface should be the charge collection-limiting side. Hence, the NiOx/perovskite interface dominates the charge collection process of carriers generated by long wavelength light in the perspective of charge extraction balance. According to the equation of IPCE = LHE × Φinj × Φcoll, where LHE is the light harvesting efficiency, Φinj is the charge injection quantum yield, and Φcoll is the charge collection efficiency, a much more efficient charge extraction and suppression of charge recombination at the NiOx-UVO/perovskite interface were deduced to be responsible for the enhanced IPCE value.

Recently, one intractable issue that hinders the development of PVSCs is the hysteresis phenomenon observed in J–V measurements, where the measured PCE highly depends on the scan rate, scan direction, etc.45–48 To examine the hysteresis effect in our nickel oxide based PVSCs, we measured the J–V curves with different scan directions and scan rates. As shown in Fig. S6,† a subtle hysteresis effect was observed for the pristine NiOx based device, with a hysteresis index (HI) value of 0.063, where HI is defined according to Kim et al.'s report.47 For the NiOx-UVO case, the HI value decreased dramatically to −0.002. This indicates that with UVO treatment of NiOx, the hysteresis effect can be significantly suppressed in inverted NiOx based PVSCs. We speculated that the decreased HI value for the NiOx-UVO based device is related to the enhanced hole extraction at the NiOx/perovskite interface. In addition, we also speculated that the enhanced hole extraction at the NiOx/perovskite interface by UVO treatment could be another possible reason for the enhanced JSC and FF.
To confirm our speculation, we performed time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements to study the hole extraction kinetics at the NiOx/perovskite interface. Fig. 4a shows the TRPL decay curves of the NiOx/perovskite and NiOx-UVO/perovskite samples. Both NiOx layers show PL quenching effects of the perovskite materials, indicating hole extraction from the perovskite to the HTL. We fitted the PL decay curves with a bi-exponential function: 1/τheterojunction = 1/τCT + 1/τperovskite, where large constant τperovskite and small constant τCT were related to the exciton lifetime of the perovskite and a fast electron or hole extraction process, respectively.49,50 As a result, the NiOx-UVO based sample shows a τCT value of 2.34 ns, which is much lower than that of the NiOx based sample (3.73 ns) and reference (53.8 ns). This result confirmed that the UVO treatment can accelerate the hole extraction at the NiOx/perovskite interface leading to the increase of the JSC and FF.

The solid lines are the fitted curves. (c) The equivalent circuit for fitting the EIS data. (d) Transient photocurrent decay of NiOx and NiOx-UVO based devices. 
To further study the charge transport and charge recombination behavior in the devices, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out over the frequency range between 1 MHz and 1 Hz under illumination. Fig. 4b shows the Nyquist plots at a bias of 0.7 V, where a high-frequency semicircle and a lower-frequency semicircle are observed for the devices. The high-frequency semicircle is usually assigned to the charge transport feature, and the low frequency region is assigned to the recombination feature.28,51 By fitting the Nyquist plot with an equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 4c, the charge transport resistance (Rtrans) and charge recombination resistance (Rrec) were obtained. The pristine NiOx based device shows a charge transport resistance value of 461.0 Ω and a charge recombination resistance value of 1246 Ω. When compared with the NiOx based device, the NiOx-UVO device shows a smaller Rtrans (263.2 Ω) and a larger Rrec (1578 Ω). This suggests that the much more efficient charge extraction process and more efficient suppression of charge recombination in the NiOx-UVO based device resulted in a better device performance than that of the NiOx based device. To further verify this, we conducted transient photocurrent decay (TPC) measurements of the devices at short circuit under light illumination.52,53Fig. 4d shows the transient photocurrent decay of NiOx and NiOx-UVO based devices. It was observed that the NiOx-UVO based device (τtrans = 11.0 μs) shows a faster decay than the NiOx based device (τtrans = 13.9 μs), which confirmed that the NiOx-UVO based device possesses a much more efficient charge transport process, leading to a higher output photocurrent.
With the presynthesized NiOx, we also fabricated planar perovskite solar cells with a flexible PEN/ITO substrate, and the optical image of a device is shown in Fig. 5. The flexible device shows a VOC of 1.04 V, a JSC of 17.74 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.642, resulting in a PCE of 11.84%. This result suggests that our presynthesized NiOx without further high temperature treatment is compatible with the flexible substrate and shows a broad application prospect for a further low-temperature roll-to-roll fabrication process.

In addition, the presynthesized NiOx is dispersed in a non-polar solvent, e.g. chlorobenzene, which is an anti-solvent that is used in the one-step deposition of perovskite films.54 Interestingly, the NiOx solution can be directly deposited on the perovskite film without decomposing the perovskite film. With this in mind, we fabricated perovskite solar cells with a configuration of FTO/compact-TiO2/meso-TiO2/perovskite/NiOx/Au, whose cross-sectional SEM image is shown in Fig. 6a. Fig. 6b shows the J–V curves of the device with an all-organic charge selection layer, where a VOC of 0.881 V, a JSC of 19.49 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.531 were obtained, resulting in a PCE of 9.11% under reverse scan (a PCE of 6.14%, where JSC = 18.55 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.801 V, and FF = 0.413 under forward scan). However, the reference device without the NiOx layer had a VOC of 0.383 V, a JSC of 15.75 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.308, resulting in a relatively low PCE of 1.81% under reverse scan (a PCE of 0.71%, where JSC = 6.54 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.431 V, and FF = 0.253 under forward scan). This is consistent with Mora-Sero et al.'s report about the importance of a selective contact layer that determines the charge recombination rate in PVSCs.55 It is to be noted that the mesoscopic layer and the perovskite layer adopted here are not optimized for hole transport material free devices. It also should be noted that both devices show a serious hysteresis phenomenon. For the NiOx based n-i-p device, the hysteresis may be attributed to the inefficient charge extraction from the perovskite to NiOx, which is due to the unremoved organic ligand that hinders the charge collection and reduces the conductivity of the NiOx layer. We also carried out UVO treatment of the NiOx layer in n-i-p devices, where the perovskite layer was destroyed and the resulting devices showed no photovoltaic efficiency. It is proposed that high efficiency n-i-p PVSCs based on an all-inorganic charge selective layer would be achieved by using a p-type semiconductor with better charge collection and conductivity, e.g. after ligand exchange. Although the efficiency of our NiOx based n-i-p device is not high, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on perovskite solar cells using solution processed NiOx as the top hole transport layer by employing the n-i-p architecture, which avoids the moisture sensitive and expensive organic hole transport materials. To evaluate the stability of NiOx devices, the unencapsulated device was stored in the dark under ambient conditions and measured for 192 h. The obtained results are shown in Fig. S7.† It was found that the NiOx based p-i-n device shows relatively better stability than the HTM-free device and the reference device with spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. This fast decay of the PCE of the HTM free device may be due to the decomposition of the perovskite, which is directly exposed to ambient air. When a non-polar solvent dispersed NiOx was deposited on the top of the perovskite, the NiOx layer could act as a protecting layer that prevents the degradation of the perovskite. As a result, the NiOx based n-i-p device shows relatively better stability than the HTM free device, as well as the spiro-OMeTAD device. Fig. S8† shows the images of a water drop on the surface of the perovskite layer and the perovskite/NiOx layer, which further supports that the NiOx layer can slow down the interaction between water and the perovskite layer in an n-i-p structured device.

Conclusions
In summary, we first successfully demonstrated a low-temperature solution-processed nickel oxide (NiOx) thin film for both inverted (p-i-n) planar and regular (n-i-p) organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells. In p-i-n cells, the wetting properties, perovskite morphology, absorption and hole extraction process can be significantly enhanced with a suitable surface treatment, resulting in a much enhanced fill factor and short circuit current density. On the basis of the treated NiOx thin film, a promising power conversion efficiency of 15.9% with negligible hysteresis was obtained for inverted planar PVSCs; a power conversion efficiency over 11% was also achieved based on a flexible substrate, which forebodes well for low-cost production scale up. When employed in n-i-p mesoscopic PVSCs, the non-polar solvent dispersed NiOx can be directly deposited on the perovskite film as a top hole transport layer without decomposing the perovskite. The resulting device shows a five-fold improvement in power conversion efficiency when compared with a hole transport material free device. These results show that this solution-processed nickel oxide is promising for all-inorganic charge selection layer based, stable and low-cost perovskite solar cells.
Experimental section
NiOx nanoparticles and film preparation
The NiOx nanoparticles were synthesized by a non-injection approach. In a typical synthesis, Ni(St)2 (1 mmol), LiSt (0.4 mmol), ODA (6 mmol), and ODE (10 mL) were added into a three-neck flask, and the reaction mixture was then degassed at 80 °C for 30 min. The solution was heated at 245 °C for a period of 3 hours under N2 flow. After the reaction was cooled to 50 °C, a greyish-green mixture was obtained. The NiOx crystal was extracted with a bi-phase system of hexane and methanol at 50 °C, and the products were dissolved in hexane. Then, the nanocrystals were precipitated by adding a mixture of ethanol and ethyl acetate. After centrifugation, the precipitate was re-dissolved with hexane, and this step was repeated twice. Then the nanocrystals were dispersed in chlorobenzene to make a solution with a concentration of 3–5 mg mL−1. The resulting solution was filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane (0.22 μm). A 30 nm-thick layer of NiOx film was spin-coated on clean ITO and PEN/ITO substrates with the above NiOx solution at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in air.
Device fabrication
Inverted planar PVSCs: the NiOx film was treated in a UVO cleaner for 0 min or 5 min before depositing the perovskite film. A solution of PbI2 (dissolved in DMF, 450 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on an ITO/NiOx substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s in dry air. A mixture of CH3NH3I/CH3NH3Cl (dissolved in isopropanol, 50/5 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the dried PbI2 layer at room temperature at 3000 rpm for 30 s in a nitrogen glovebox. Then, the obtained films were annealed in air at 135 °C for 15 min. A solution of PCBM (dissolved in chlorobenzene, 20 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 1000 rpm for 30 s in a nitrogen glovebox. A solution of BCP (dissolved in isopropanol, 0.5 mg mL−1) was spin-cast on the PCBM film at 6000 rpm for 30 s in a nitrogen glovebox. Finally, a 100 nm silver layer was deposited as the counter electrode on the top of the BCP layer through shadow masks via thermal evaporation under high vacuum (5 × 10−5 Pa). Normal mesoscopic PVSCs:56 a compact TiO2 layer was deposited on a cleaned FTO glass by spin-coating a low-temperature TiOx solution6 at 3000 rpm for 30 min. The films were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature. A 150 nm mesoporous TiO2 layer was then prepared by spin-coating a solution of mesoporous TiO2 (DSL. 18NR-T, 20 nm, Dyesol, Australia, diluted at a 1/6 mass ratio of paste/ethanol) on a compact TiO2 layer at 4000 rpm for 20 s. The films were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature. 461 mg of PbI2 and 159 mg of CH3NH3I were dissolved in a mixed solution of DMF (0.633 μL) and DMSO (71 μL) to prepare a perovskite precursor solution. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on mesoporous TiO2 at 5000 rpm for 20 s, and 0.5 mL of diethyl ether was added dropwise onto the rotating substrate in 10 s before the surface changed turbid. The obtained film was annealed at 65 °C for 1 min and 100 °C for 2 min. The NiOx solution was spin-coated on the obtained perovskite film at 1000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm gold layer was deposited as the counter electrode on the top of the NiOx layer through shadow masks via thermal evaporation.
Characterization
A xenon light source solar simulator (450 W, Oriel, model 9119) with an AM 1.5G filter (Oriel, model 91192) was used to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 at the surface of the solar cells. The current–voltage characteristics of the devices under these conditions were obtained by applying an external potential bias to the devices and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter (Keithley, USA). The effective area of each cell was 0.100 cm2 defined by masks for all the photovoltaic devices discussed in this work. Transient-state photoluminescence (PL) was measured on an FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd) with excitation at 470 nm. The NiOx layer and the perovskite layer were deposited onto the quartz substrates as described above for time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements. UV-Vis spectra were obtained with a Varian Cary 50 ultraviolet-visible spectrometer. The NiOx layer and the perovskite layer were deposited onto the quartz substrates as described above for UV-Vis spectroscopy measurements. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out on ZAHNER ENNIUM Electrochemical Workstations in the frequency range of 100 mHz to 1 MHz with 10 mV AC amplitude under light. The Z-view software (v2.8b) was used to analyze the impedance data. The transient photovoltage/photocurrent decay measurements were carried out to obtain the charge dynamics of the device (HuaMing, model 201501). A white light bias on the device sample was generated from an array of diodes. A ring of red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) (Lumiled) was controlled by a fast solid-state switch. The pulse widths were 2 ms. Transients were measured at different white light intensities via tuning the voltage applied to the bias diodes. The voltage output was recorded on an oscilloscope directly connected with the cells. The crystal phases of NiOx were identified by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, X'Pert PRO, Cu Kα radiation, PANalytical B. V.). A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FEI Nova 230 NanoSEM) was used to acquire SEM images. The morphology of the NiOx film was identified by AFM (Bruker Innova-IRIS). XPS measurements were carried out on an XPS AXIS Ultra DLD (Kratos Analytical). An Al Kα X-ray was used as the excitation source. The work functions of the NiOx and NiOx-UVO films were measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Ac-2, Riken Keiki).
