By the introduction of sulfur into the tetragonal BiCoO3 perovskite with a C-type antiferromagnetic ordering, it is found that the bandgap of BiCoO2S decreases significantly (about 1.2 eV) while maintaining a large polarization value (about 1.86 C m−2) that is similar to the value of 1.793 C m−2 of BiCoO3. Most noteworthy is that the optical absorption of BiCoO2S is remarkably higher than those of BiCoO3 and other FE-PV materials. The decrease of the BiCoO2S bandgap originates from the movement of Co 3d states to a low-energy position due to the reduction of the Co ionicity when the less electronegative sulfur is introduced into BiCoO3 to substitute oxygen. The narrow bandgap and the high optical absorption of the BiCoO2S films grown on different substrates are favorable for FE-PV applications. In addition, the bandgap of BiCoO2S can be modulated by the doping amount of sulfur, which can help us fabricate multilayer FE-PV devices based on different bandgaps from different layers.
1. Introduction
Improving the performances of functional materials is a goal to be achieved for researchers.1–3 A large bandgap is a critical factor hindering the development of ferroelectric photovoltaics (FE-PVs). Most of the FE-PV materials, typically perovskite oxides (ABO3),4 have large bandgaps, generally above 3 eV, resulting in low output photocurrent densities (on the order of nA cm−2).5,6 Moreover, our current research is mainly at the laboratory level rather than having any realistic applications although the FE-PV effect was discovered approximately 60 years ago.7,8 Since the electrons and holes can be separated by an internal dipole field originating from the spontaneous electric polarization of the FE-PV materials,9,10 the FE-PV materials are completely different from traditional p–n junction photovoltaic materials used in the commercialized crystalline silicon solar panels. As a result, the output open-circuit voltage Voc can be several orders of magnitude larger than the bandgap of the FE-PV materials, which is defined as the anomalous photovoltaic (APV) effect. This unique and important characteristic distinguishes the FE-PV devices from traditional p–n junction photovoltaic devices. The value of Voc in traditional p–n junction solar cells is restricted by the bandgap size of the light-absorbing semiconductors,11 resulting in a large amount of harvestable energy that cannot be collected. Lowering the bandgap of the FE-PV materials can enhance the visible light absorption of FE-based solar cells, and an ideal bandgap value of 1.4 eV was reported based on the maximum theoretical PCE (the power conversion efficiency) of a semiconductor PV cell.12 The chemical doping of the FE-PV materials is regarded as the simplest strategy for lowering the bandgap of the FE materials, especially doping at the A or B site of the ABO3 perovskite structure.13,14 BiFeO3 and BiFeO3-based perovskites have been largely investigated due to their relatively lower bandgap of 2.67 eV.15 It was found that doping at the B-site can lower the bandgap and increase the visible-light absorption of Bi(Fe, M)O3 (M = Cr, Mn, Co) obviously.13 Furthermore, a PCE of 8.1% was obtained in a Bi2FeCrO6 (BFCO) film solar cell16 by lowering the bandgap and designing a multilayer configuration. Another commonly used method of lowering the bandgap is to introduce anion impurities such as N, C, S, and I with p orbitals that are higher in energy than the p orbital of O, for example, in the photoelectrochemical water oxidation of the metal/transition metal oxide materials.17–21 The bandgap of N-doped LaTiO2N is reduced to 2.1 eV because of the lower electronegativity (η = 3.04) of N compared with that of O (η = 3.44).22 Substituting the less electronegative S for the highly electronegative O induced a decrease in the bandgap of PbTiO3 from 3.44 eV to 2.25 eV while maintaining a large polarization.23 On the other hand, different from other anions, the substitution of isovalent sulfur preserves charge neutrality of a perovskite structure so that no new vacancies are created, avoiding the increase of leakage current of ferroelectric materials. As we all know, a high leakage current is detrimental to polarization of the FE-PV materials.24,25 In addition, the FE-PV materials must possess large enough polarization, in order to improve their photocurrent and photovoltage.16 Therefore, a ferroelectric material with a narrower bandgap and a larger polarization value is ideal for developing high performance FE-PV devices although few results have been reported on this type of ferroelectric material.
Multiferroics possess not only ferroelectricity but also ferromagnetism, and the electron–electron interaction governing the magnetic ordering leads to a smaller gap (typically 2.6–2.7 eV for BiFeO3) compared with those of other ferroelectric perovskites. Accordingly, multiferroic oxides such as BiFeO3 and BiFeO3-based perovskites exhibit higher photovaltaic efficiencies.16,26,27 Among other perovskites, BiCoO3 (BCO) with a PbTiO3-type structure and magnetic ions has been synthesized using a high-pressure (HP) technique,28 and is suggested to be a promising multiferroic material using both first principles calculations and experiments.29–31 BCO has a giant tetragonal lattice distortion of c/a = 1.27 with large off-center atomic displacements.28 It is an insulator with a C-type antiferromagnetic order at TN = 470 K and the spontaneous polarization and the bandgap of BCO are 1.79 C m−2 and 1.98 eV, respectively, obtained using first principles calculations,29 and is a potential FE-PV material. Although BiCo1−xFexO3, BiCoO3-based materials, were demonstrated to have good photovoltaic properties because of the B-site solid solution with Fe,32 the decrease of their bandgap and absorption increase of visible-light still need to be improved for practical applications.
In this work, the introduction of sulfur into BCO is first investigated using first principles calculations, which can reasonably predict the properties of new materials.33–35 The optimal site for replacing oxygen of BCO with sulfur is confirmed according to the lowest energy of all possible substitution sites. The BiCoO2S (BCOS) perovskite structure is demonstrated to have a narrow bandgap and a very large polarization. Especially, the giant visible-light absorption of BCOS is attributed to the substitution of sulfur.
2. Computation details
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the VASP code36,37 at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) revised by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof for the solids approach (PBEsol),38 which effectively improved the accuracy of the bandgap calculations more than other exchange–correlation functionals. All calculations were based on the projector-augmented-plane-wave method (PAW).39 A Gaussian broadening40 of 0.05 eV was set for Brillouin-zone integration during all relaxations. The wave functions were expanded in plane waves with an energy cutoff of 520 eV and a 6 × 6 × 6 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh41 was used for geometry optimization of a 40 atom 2 × 2 × 2 supercell of the 5-atom perovskite unit cell. Since the local-spin-density approximation (LSDA) often underestimates the bandgap in the strongly localized d-orbital system, the spin-polarized GGA+U approach42,43 was used to obtain a reasonable bandgap. The effective Hubbard parameter Ueff = U (Hubbard parameter) − J (exchange interaction)44 was adopted. The values of Ueff were set to be 4 eV for the Co 3d states. For the density of states (DOS) and the Berry-phase calculations45,46 (the so-called “modern” theory of polarization), a uniform 9 × 9 × 9 k-point mesh was found to be adequate.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Ground-state properties
For antiferromagnetic ordering in the perovskite structure of ABO3, there are three possible arrangements of spin for B-site magnetic atoms such as A-type, C-type and G-type (Fig. 1a–c). Considering a ferromagnetic (FM) ordering (Fig. 1d) of the B-site magnetic atoms, the energies of four BCO with tetrahedral structures (Fig. 1e) were calculated as shown in Fig. 2. The results show that BCO with a C-type antiferromagnetic ordering (C-BCO) is the most stable structure. The lattice parameters are a = 3.721 Å and c = 4.679 Å, yielding a c/a ratio of 1.264, and the bandgap and the polarization values of C-BCO are 1.71 eV and 1.793 C m−2, respectively, which are in good agreement with previously published theoretical and experimental data.29,47,48 Due to the different treatment of the exchange–correlation functions and the arrangement of different magnetic configurations of tetragonal BiCoO3, the reported bandgap ranges from 0.6 eV to 3.3 eV.29,48–52 Unlike Co3O4 that did not exhibit a strong electron correlation and whose electronic structure and semiconducting nature obtained from standard DFT agreed well with the experimental results,53,54 BiCoO3 is a typical Mott insulator47,52 due to the large on-site Coulomb interaction U between the Co 3d electrons with the high spin state of the spin configuration of Co3+. The lattice parameters (a, c and c/a) and the magnetic moment (μB) obtained using the GGA with U = 0 calculation are not consistent with the high spin Co3+ values obtained from the experiments (Table S1, ESI†). As is known to all, in Mott insulators with a large on-site Coulomb interaction U term, the bandgap and the magnetic moment tend to be underestimated due to the self-interaction effect of standard DFT. The DOSs of C-type BCO with different U values are plotted as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), which is in good agreement with previous theoretical results.55 It shows that the electronic structures did not introduce remarkable distortions with the increase of the U value, which is different from Co3O4. Since the bandgap value of 1.71 eV is in good agreement with the experimental results,24 the appropriate U = 4 is chosen to obtain the reasonable bandgap of BCO and BCOS. The energy difference between the C-type and G-type is very small (0.018 eV), indicating that BCO with the G-type (G-BCO) co-exists with C-BCO. The lattice parameters, bandgaps and polarization values of G-BCO and C-BCO are listed in Table 1, no obvious differences can be found.

There are two possible sites for substituting oxygen of BCO with sulfur such as Sa and Sb (Fig. 1e). The Sa site is the most optimized substitution site, and is 0.655 eV lower than Sb in the supercell structure for BCO as shown in Fig. 1e. It indicates that the perovskite structure BCOS (Fig. 1f) is easier to form than BiCoS2O (BCSO) (not shown) with oxygen substituted by sulfur at the Sb-site. Similar to BCO, the ground-state of BCOS has also a C-type antiferromagnetic ordering, whose energy is 14 meV lower than that of the G-type (Fig. 2). Due to the introduction of sulfur at the Sa site, the lattice parameters a and c become larger than those of BCO as shown in Table 1. The BCOS preserves the tetragonal structure with a smaller increase of a and a larger increase of c (5.567 Å for the C-type, 5.582 Å for the G-type) and c/a (1.474 for the C-type, 1.479 for the G-type). The bond lengths of Bi–O/S and Co–O/S are summarized in Table 2. After the introduction of sulfur, the bond length D and the relative distance Δz of Bi–S and Co–S become longer than those of Bi–ONV and Co–ONV in the z coordinate direction, and the Co–ONP bond lengths have a small change compared with BCO, resulting in the stretching of the BCOS structure along the z axis.

By our calculations, the bandgaps of BCOS for the C-type (C-BCOS) and the G-type (G-BCOS) are 0.67 eV and 0.73 eV, respectively, suggesting that the bandgap of BCOS decreases remarkably by the introduction of sulfur, which is similar to PbTiO2S and BaZrO2S.23,56 Based on the bandgap of BCO as shown in Fig. 3, C-BCO and G-BCO are direct bandgap semiconductors at the Γ point. The contributions of each atom to the energy level in BCO and BCOS are first investigated using the band structures in order to clarify the major factors related to these variations in the bandgap properties. Among the four constituents of BCO, the Co atom (3d states) mainly contributes to the energy level at the conduction band minimum (CBM) state, and the energy level at the valence band maximum (VBM) state is primarily affected by both Co (3d states) and O (2p states) atoms. The contribution of the Bi (6p states) atom is very small for both CBM and VBM states. The band dispersion at the bottom of the CBM for the G-type is larger than that of the C-type, indicating that G-BCO has better carrier mobility than C-BCO. For BCOS, the contribution of each atom is similar to BCO at the CBM and VBM. The most distinction is that the CBM state moves to the Fermi level considerably. In addition, the S 3p states play an important role in VBM states though the number of S atoms is only one-third of O atoms in a supercell structure. The BCOS becomes an indirect bandgap semiconductor from the Γ point of the VBM to between Γ and X points of the CBM for C-BCOS (between Γ and M points of the CBM for G-BCOS). The decrease of the bandgap dispersion at the CBM state of BCOS increases the capability of the carrier, and strengthens the absorption of visible-light, which can be demonstrated by the absorption coefficient as discussed in the following part. The difference between C-BCOS and G-BCOS at the band structure becomes small due to the substitution of sulfur.

3.2 Electronic structures
To understand the origin of changes in the bandgap characteristics by the introduction of sulfur in BCO, the projected density of states (PDOS) of each atom for BCO and BCOS are presented in Fig. 4. Similar to most of the FE materials,13,57 the major contributions of the CBM and VBM in BCO (Fig. 4a and b) come from the transition metal d states (Co 3d states for BCO) and anion O 2p states, respectively, which is consistent with the previous calculation results.47,48 The Bi 6p states mainly distribute in the high-energy position of the CBM, except for a limited portion in the range 0 to 7.0 eV under the Fermi level. Namely, the distributions of the CBM and the VBM are mainly dominated by the CoO5 square pyramidal structure with four reduced equatorial Co–O bonds and a shorter apical Co–O bond, similar to PbTiO3 and BiFeO3 with a tetrahedral structure.15,47 According to the crystal-field theory, the Co 3d state in the perovskite structure splits into four states from lower energy to higher energy such as eg (a doubly degenerate pair dxz and dyz), b2g (dxy), a1g (dz2) and b1g (dx2−y2). The high spin state of the Co3+ ion is present as . Thus, the  unoccupied states contribute to the CBM of BCO. Herein, the contribution of the O 2p state is not ignored, especially for G-BCO. While the VBM of BCO mainly comes from the O 2p occupied states and partially comes from the Co 3d (e2gb12ga11g) occupied states due to the nonbonding state of .
 Fig. 4  Projected density of states of BCO and BCOS. (a) C-BCO; (b) G-BCO; (c) C-BCOS; (d) G-BCOS. 
By the introduction of sulfur, the Co 3d unoccupied state moves to a lower-energy position, resulting in a remarkable decrease of the bandgap. The movement of the O 2p unoccupied state is less than that of the Co 3d unoccupied states so that the Co 3d unoccupied states play more important roles in the CBM of BCOS. The outstanding movement of the CBM mainly originates from the electrostatic effect due to the different electronegativity between oxygen and sulfur. The Co-derived bands in the CBM of BCOS demonstrate obvious localization, and these localized in-gap Co-bands result from the Co 3d and O 2p states with both nonbonding and antibonding characters, which can be considered as the intermediate bands due to the separation from the conduction band, which is useful to help the absorption of multi-wavelengths to enhance PV functionality.58
The ionic charges of Co for BCO and BCOS are calculated by Bader charge analysis59 as shown in Table 3. The ionicity values of Co for C-BCO, G-BCO, C-BCOS and G-BCOS are 1.423, 1.421, 1.277, and 1.279, respectively, suggesting that the Co ionicity of BCOS is weaker than that of BCO. The ionicity weakening of Co induces the nonbonding character, pushing the  states of the CBM to a lower-energy position (Fig. 4c and d), together with the unshifting of the VBM, resulting in a remarkable bandgap reduction of BCOS.

Based on the orbital contribution and electron–hole pair generating mechanism of the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB), partial charge densities of the VBM and CBM for BCO and BCOS are plotted to display the contribution of each atom as shown in Fig. 5. For C-BCO and G-BCO, the yellow isosurfaces in the VBM are distributed on most of the 2p states of O and partial 3d states of Co, while in the CBM, are mainly with the 3d states of Co and the partial 2d states of O. It indicates that the electrons and holes are contributed by the 3d states of Co and the 2p states of O, suggesting that the recombination of electrons and holes will rapidly occur, which influences the absorption effectively of visible-light seriously. Distinctly different from BCO, the VBM of C-BCOS and G-BCOS are mainly contributed by 3p states of S, the contribution of the 3d states of Co and 2p states of O is very limited, while the CBM are nearly all distributed on the 3d states of Co. This means that the electron–hole recombination is effectively suppressed in BCOS. Such results manifest that the electrons and holes can separate efficiently the CBM and the VBM, since the electrons on the 3p states of S are excited to the 3d states of Co under photo excitation.

To study the bond difference between BCO and BCOS, the electron localization function (ELF) is calculated as shown in Fig. 6. The ELF is derived from the Pauli repulsion values and is confined to the [1, 0] interval.60 According to the definition of the ELF, the values 1 and 0 of the ELF represent the perfect localization (covalent bonding) and the complete delocalization (ionic bonding or a precursor to metallic bonding). ELF = 0.5 corresponds to electron-gas-like pair probability (metallic bonding).61 It shows that the ionic bonding of Co–O/S in BCOS becomes weaker than that of BCO, while the covalent bonding of Co–O/S strengthens, which is in good agreement with DOS and Bader charge analysis. We should note that the bonding difference between BCOS and BCO is mainly observed in the spin-up Co atom. The different spin directions influencing the ionicity of Co–O/S are confirmed by Bader charge analysis, whose calculated values are 1.277, 1.275 for C-BCOS, 1.279, 1.278 for G-BCOS, respectiely, as shown in Table 3. Correspondingly, the S near Co is also different from Co in the spin direction, which can be attributed to the different electrostatic effect of S and O. Herein, the magnetic moment of different spin directions for Co3+ are the same (m = 2.814μB for C-BCOS and 2.824μB for G-BCOS), which are less than those of BCO (m = 2.950μB for C-BCO, 2.958μB for G-BCO). The values of the magnetic moment for BCO are in good agreement with the previous experimental and theoretical results.28,48

3.3 Optical absorption
To obtain more direct insight into the effect of the sulfur introduction on the optical absorption, the dielectric functions of BCO and BCOS were calculated, which are generally used to describe the linear response of a system to electromagnetic radiation.62 The absorption coefficient α(ω) can be gained by the real part ε1(ω) and the imaginary part ε2(ω) of the dielectric function:63 (1)where ω is the angular frequency. Fig. 7 shows the optical absorption coefficient as a function of optical wavelength. Encouragingly, the optical absorption coefficient of BCOS is much larger than that of BCO at visible-light and long wavelengths, suggesting that more significant visible-light absorption will occur in BCOS. The large optical absorption results from the narrow bandgap and the weak electron–hole recombination as mentioned above. Compared with the B-site substitution of BiFeO3,13,16 the increase of the absorption coefficient is very significant. The reason is mainly that the CBM is almost completely contributed by a large number of Co 3d states, providing a considerable amount of unoccupied states to receive excited electrons. However, the bandgap decrease for BFO with B-site substitution comes from the very limited Bi 6p states, considerably influencing the real absorption efficient though the bandgap is very small.13,57

3.4 Strain
Thin films of the FE-PV materials show much better performance16 than bulk although the films have to be grown on different substrates64–68 to meet various applications. Herein, the properties of the FE-PV materials can also be influenced by strain69 due to different substrates. The substrates commonly used for growing ferroelectric films are YAlO3 (a = 3.716 Å), LaSrAlO4 (a = 3.754 Å), LaAlO3 (a = 3.794 Å), LaSrGaO4 (a = 3.830 Å), (La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3 (a = 3.868 Å), and SrTiO3 (a = 3.905 Å), which provide compressive strain or tensile strain in the BCOS films (a = 3.78 Å for C-BCOS and a = 3.77 Å for G-BCOS). The bandgaps of C-BCOS and G-BCOS do not have an obvious difference due to either compressive strain or tensile strain [Fig. S2, S3 ESI,† and Fig. 8], suggesting that the bandgap of BCOS is insensitive to the strain. This indicates that BCOS can grow on different substrates without obviously influencing optical absorption. The bandgap of C-BCOS is different from that of G-BCOS, showing a trend of increase and then decrease, which is relative to the transition of the high k-point from between Γ and X to M at the CBM. Corresponding to the small bandgap change, the absorption coefficient also does not obviously change with different strains as shown in Fig. 9.

3.5 The doping amount of sulfur in C-BCOS
BiCoO3−xSx (x = 1) has been discussed in detail, however, in the supercell structure of C-BCO as a typical example, there are eight Sb sites (Fig. 1a). The bandgaps and the optical absorption coefficients of BiCoO3−xSx (x = 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, and 0.825) have been calculated. The most stable structure of every sulfur doping is confirmed using the total energy calculations (Fig. S4, ESI†), whose bandgap (Fig. S5, ESI†) and absorption coefficient (Fig. 10) are calculated. It is found that the bandgap and the absorption coefficient decrease with the increase of the sulfur doping amount except for x = 0.25. The narrow bandgap of x = 0.25 for BiCoO3−xSx contributes to the limited Co 3d states (Fig. S6, ESI†). The different bandgaps for the different dopings of BiCoO3−xSx can be utilized in the high-efficiency optimized multilayer devices,16 in which, each layer is tuned to absorb in a specific region of the solar spectrum, similar to multijunction PV devices.

3.6 Formation energies of C-BCOS
Few results have been reported on the preparation of BCOS until now, but the ordered oxysulfides can be synthetized by replacing O of metal oxides.70 Therefore, the reaction energies for replacing O with S via gaseous reagents were calculated to evaluate whether synthesis is energetically feasible. There are three possible reactions to form BCOS according to different gaseous reactants such as S, H2S and CS2 as follows: BiCoO3(s) + (1/2)S2(g) → BiCoO2S(s) + (1/2)O2(g)(2) BiCoO3(s) + H2S(g) → BiCoO2S(s) + H2O(g)(3) BiCoO3(s) + (1/2)CS2(g) → BiCoO2S(s) + (1/2)CO2(g)(4)
The corresponding reaction energies are calculated using the following formula Ea = Et − Et′. Et and Et′ are the total energies of the reactants and the products, respectively. The total energies of S2, H2S, and CS2 are the energies of the isolate molecules. According to this definition, a negative value indicates that it is energetically favorable for the reagents to form more stable products and vice versa. Ea values of reactions (1), (2) and (3) are 0.712 eV, −0.654 eV and −0.780 eV, respectively. It indicates that the C-BCOS can be synthetized by H2S and CS2, and the CS2 is the best candidate for the gaseous reactant. However, it is very difficult to synthesize bulk single crystals with a sufficient amount of sulfur such as perovskite oxides because of the volatility of the sulfur element using the conventional solid-state reaction method at a high sintering temperature.71–73 Fortunately, a new and facile method has been established to realize perovskite oxysulfides with high crystallinity.74 The properties of the PZT oxysulfides such as the enhancement of the polarization and the reduction of the bandgap were verified using theoretical predictions,23 which demonstrates the possibility to synthesize the BCO oxysulfides.
3.7 Polarization and coercive field of C-BCOS
For FE-PV materials, ferroelectricity is another significant factor as well as the narrow bandgap. Because polarization can greatly impact the PV properties, a balance between the bandgap and polarization should be considered in order to achieve efficient Bi2FeCrO6-based PV devices.16 The polarization value of C-BCOS is calculated as shown in Table 1. It shows that C-BCOS have large polarizations as well as C-BCO. After S introduction, the c/a of C-BCOS increases to 1.474, which is beneficial for enhancing the polarization of ferroelectric materials like Pb(Ti,Zr)O3 and BiFeO3.64,75 As we all know, otherwise, for Bi-based perovskites (for example BiFeO376) the noncentrosymmetric distribution of lone pair electrons around Bi atoms induces ferroelectricity. Similarly, the polarization of C-BCO also mainly originates from the contribution of long pair electrons of Bi atoms based on the ELF (Fig. S7, ESI†) through the increase of c/a of C-BCOS. The small difference in C-BCO and C-BCOS results in their small polarization difference. Similar to Bi-based perovskite structures, the polarization variation of C-BCO after sulfur doping is different from the PZT23,74 that is enhanced with the introduction of sulfur.
To obtain the coercive field of C-BCOS, the following formula is used:77 (5)where E is the switching barrier of the FE materials per 5-atom cell unit between the two oppositely polarized states. P is the electric polarization at the bottom of the double well potential normalized per area perpendicular to the polarization direction per 5-atom cell. V is the volume of the FE materials per 5-atom cell. The switching barrier is obtained to be 2.584 eV 5-atom cell by calculating the energy difference between the ferroelectric state and the paraelectric state of C-BCOS. The corresponding coercive field of 2189 MV m−1 is significantly larger than those of traditional ferroelectrics such as PbTiO3,77 while it is close to that of the similar perovskite oxysulfur BaZrO2S.56 The large coercive field can benefit the FE-PV device since it is helpful to maintain stable polarity in a complex field environment.
3.8 The stability of C-BCOS
To measure the mechanical stability properties of C-BCOS, the elastic constants are calculated (Table S2, ESI†). It is found that C-BCOS has mechanical stability based on the mechanical stability criteria of the tetrahedral phase [C11 > 0, C33 > 0, C44 > 0, C66 > 0, (C11 − C12) > 0, (C11 + C33 − 2C13) > 0].78,79
To measure its chemical stability, the binding energy (Eb) per formula unit (f.u.) of the C-BCOS, which is the difference between the total energy of the compound and the composition weighted average total energies of the pure elements, is described as: Eb = Etot − EBisolid − ECosolid − 2EOgas − ESsolid(6)where Etot is the total energy of C-BCO. EBisolid, ECosolid and ESsolid are the energy per atom of bulk Bi, Co and S, respectively; EOgas is the energy per O atom of O2 molecules. Negative binding energy usually means an exothermic process, and the lower binding energy corresponds to the stronger combination stability. The binding energy of C-BCOS is −1.84 eV per f.u., which is very low compared with its decomposition energy as shown in Table S3 (ESI†). This indicates that the decomposition of C-BCOS needs high energy under ambient conditions, for example, high temperature, similar to the decomposition of BCO in air above 720 K.
4. Conclusions
A narrow bandgap and a large polarization value of BCOS were obtained by the introduction of sulfur into BCO. The substitution of Sa-site oxygen by sulfur in BCO (BCOS) results in a stable structure, which is an optimized tetragonal perovskite structure like PbTiO3. The ground-state of BCOS has still a C-type antiferromagnetic ordering the same as BCO. The bandgap decreases rapidly from 1.83 eV to 0.67 eV for C-BCOS, and 1.52 eV to 0.73 eV for G-BCOS, which results from the large movement of the Co 3d states to a low-energy position due to the obvious difference in electronegativity between sulfur and oxygen. The ionicity decrease of Co induces the strengthening of nonbonding states of Co, resulting in the Co 3d states shifting to a low-energy position. The Co 3d states of the CBM for BCOS play a more important role than those for BCO, resulting in a sharp decrease of the electron-hole recombination and further a remarkable strengthening of the optical absorption. In addition, the bandgap of BCOS is not confined to the substrates, and therefore it can be applied under wider conditions. The sulfur doping amount can modulate the bandgap of BiCoO3−xSx, which is favorable for the high-efficiency optimized multilayer devices in which different layers have different bandgaps. Furthermore, we found using reaction energy calculations that BCOS can be synthesized using gaseous reactants such as S2, H2S and CS2. The polarization of BCOS are very large as well as BCO, which is 1.863 C m−2 for C-BCOS, meanwhile the large coercive field of C-BCOS is favorable for the stabilization of C-BCOS as the FE-PV materials. This work provides a new strategy to lower the bandgap of the FE-PV materials and strengthen optical absorption.
