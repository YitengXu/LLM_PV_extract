    , Accepted 16th June 2022First published on 17th June 2022AbstractPotassium and sodium ion batteries have emerged as promising next-generation energy storage devices owing to the merits of low cost and high availability. However, the large radius of Na/K ions hinders the development of suitable electrode materials. Herein, we propose a “trash to treasure” concept, transforming the wasted agarose from bio labs into high performance carbonaceous electrode materials for Na/K-ion batteries, which agrees well with the global carbon neutrality target. With the assistance of the dual heteroatom doping strategy, the as-synthesized carbons deliver unique properties including enlarged interspaces, abundant defective sites, and amorphous microstructures, which boost the capacitive behaviors and lead to a much better battery performance in both half cells and full cells. This work provides a facile and practical strategy to search and develop suitable electrode materials for Na/K-ion batteries, and deepens the understanding of structure–performance correlations over carbon electrodes.
1. Introduction
With carbon neutrality growing as a global consensus, developing and utilizing renewable energy from renewable resources, such as solar, wind, tides, and waves, has become an urgent demand.1 However, these natural resources exhibit intermittent characteristics depending on the weather conditions. Therefore, it is urgent to develop low-cost and effective energy storage devices.2 In the past two decades, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been the heart of mobile electronic devices (phones, tablets, and laptops), electric bicycles, e-scooters, power and gardening tools, and forklifts, and the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was jointly awarded to John B. Goodenough, M. Stanley Whittingham, and Akira Yoshino for their pioneering work in developing Li-ion batteries.3 Nowadays, rapid development of electric vehicles and electricity grids are raising concerns about the long-term sustainability based on the scarce earth abundance of lithium and cobalt, not to mention the cost anxieties. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop alternative battery chemistries with performance comparable to LIBs, and superiorities in reserves and costs.1,4–7
Batteries based on sodium and potassium, with substantial reserves on earth (2.3 wt% and 1.5 wt% for sodium and potassium, respectively) and similar properties to those of lithium (0.0017 wt%), have received enormous attention in the past few years. Besides, sodium and potassium carbonate are significantly less expensive than lithium carbonate, which further envisions a better prospect in large-scale energy applications, such as electric vehicles and electricity grids. However, compared to Li+ with an ionic radius of 0.76 Å, the insertion/extraction of larger Na+ (1.02 Å) and K+ (1.38 Å) in electrode materials causes sluggish reaction kinetics and poor cycling stability, addressing the necessity of searching for or designing suitable electrode materials with broader ion transport channels and more reversible ion storage sites.8–13 As for cathode materials, polyanion-type and Prussian-based materials have been widely reported with relatively satisfactory electrochemical performance for SIBs and PIBs, respectively.14–17 Specifically, polyanion-type materials, such as Na3V2(PO4)3 and KVOPO4, belong to the NASICON (Na-super-ionic conductor) structural family with ion storage sites inside the crystals and three-dimensional open channels, which enables reversible and rapid Na+/K+ transport.18,19 Similarly, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with robust open frameworks and large interstitial sites ensure fast ion transport and accommodate the volume variation induced by ion insertion/extraction.20–22
Compared to cathode materials, anode materials determine the full cell performance of both SIBs and PIBs, which is contrary to LIBs with commercial graphite serving as an ideal anode material.23–25 Currently, based on the reaction mechanism, the reported anode materials can be mainly classified into five categories, including carbonaceous materials,26–36 alloying-type,37–42 conversion-type,43–45 intercalation-type,46–49 and organics.50–52 Although significant progress in capacity, cyclability and rate capability have been achieved, several issues still exist: (i) Conversion and intercalation anodes deliver a high theoretical capacity but encounter poor cyclability. (ii) Intercalation-type anodes exhibit a relatively low specific capacity and high discharge/charge plateau, jointly corresponding to a low energy density. (iii) Organics are shackled by the inherently poor electronic conductivity, limited specific capacity, and undesired solubility in the liquid electrolyte. Among the reported anodes, carbonaceous materials with high electronic conductivity, wide availability, excellent chemical stability and low cost have attracted enormous attention and spawned a substantial number of research studies.53,54 Especially, hard carbons (HCs) with an enlarged interlayer distance, smaller crystal domains, and enhanced capacitive behaviors all contribute to a high diffusion coefficient and specific capacity, which have been preliminarily commercialized in SIBs and are considered as promising anode materials for PIBs.27,35,55–58 The current commercial HCs are mainly produced by pyrolyzing coal tar, an essential energy source on earth. And the mass production of HCs through this route is apparently opposed to the scope of building a sustainable world. Once by chance, we noticed lots of agarose gels inside a trash bin in a biology laboratory, which play a vital role in electrophoresis experiments, tissue culture, and DNA isolation. Importantly, the agarose gel is disposable after the above experiments in most cases, which inspires this work under an interdisciplinary mindset.59
Herein, we collected the discarded agarose gels and successfully transformed them into hard carbons, which serve as the anode for SIBs and PIBs and deliver satisfactory electrochemical performances in both half cells and full cells. We carefully evaluated the microstructures of the as-synthesized carbons, and the structure–performance correlations are tactfully constructed through GITT (galvanostatic intermittent titration technique) analysis and consecutive CV (cyclic voltammetry) measurements. Besides, a surface modification strategy of dual heteroatom doping was introduced and an enhanced electrochemical performance was realized. Moreover, the practical prospect is well demonstrated in full cells. Overall speaking, this work may boost a closer cooperation between biologists and materials scientists, and the “trash to treasure” concept will broaden the pathways for searching sustainable electrode materials under the global carbon neutrality target.
2. Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1, we first introduced a freeze-drying process to remove the solvent and obtain precursor foams with abundant pores. Afterwards, a ball milling treatment was employed to realize a uniform particle size. In this process, urea and thiourea can be incorporated into the precursors. And heteroatom doped hard carbons, denoted as AGC-N and AGC-NS, can be obtained after a facile pyrolysis process. Besides, as reported in our previous studies,32,60 N doping and N, S co-doping have been proved effective in promoting K-ion storage capabilities, especially the rate performance and cyclability, attributed to the modulated surface electronic structure, enlarged interlayer and low graphitization degree.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the preparation process of AGC-x. 
The structure of the final product AGC-x is first characterized. As shown in Fig. 2a, two obvious peaks at 23.98° and 43.92° correspond to the characteristic (002) and (101) crystal phases of carbonaceous materials. Especially, based on the Bragg Equations, the shifted (002) phase correlates to broader in-plane diffusing channels (3.708 Å) compared with commercial graphite (3.354 Å). Besides, the broad peak feature covering a wide 2θ range indicates a relatively amorphous structure with improved ion accessibility, which also illustrates the similar (002) peak position among all AGC-x materials. Furthermore, Raman spectra revealed the featured D and G bands with a similar wide FWHM (full width at half maximum) and the high ID/IG ratios (0.84, 0.86 and 0.89 for AGC, AGC-N, and AGC-NS, respectively), consolidating the amorphous and defective structure of AGC-x (Fig. 2b). Besides, the slightly higher ID/IG ratios of AGC-N and AGC-NS imply the successful heteroatom doping.

Morphological characterization further confirms the uniform distribution of AGC-x benefitting from the ball milling treatment (Fig. 2c, d and S1†). The porous structure was further confirmed with the TEM image (Fig. 2e). The amorphous feature is shown in Fig. 2f, in which no obvious lattice fringes can be found. And the blurry SAED (selected are electron diffraction) rings rather than diffraction spots further support this phenomenon (Fig. 2g). Moreover, EELS (electron energy loss spectroscopy, Fig. 2h–m) elemental mapping indicates uniform and successful N, S co-doping in AGC-NS, which is in accordance with the Raman spectra and indicates an anticipated electrochemical performance.
AGC-x based electrode materials were first evaluated in SIBs (Fig. 3a). The initial discharge capacities of AGC, AGC-N, and AGC-NS are 537.4 mA h g−1, 643.4 mA h g−1, and 810.5 mA h g−1, respectively, which corresponds to ICEs (initial coulombic efficiency) of 43.49%, 40.76%, and 40.75% (Fig. S2†). The capacity is relatively low in the initial 20 cycles and remains stable subsequently. After 200 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, the AGC-NS electrode retains a high discharge capacity of 326.3 mA h g−1, 44.2% higher than that of the AGC electrode (226.2 mA h g−1, Fig. 3b and c). Considering the unique amorphous and defective structure, rate capability was carefully evaluated. As shown in Fig. 3d, the AGC- NS electrode delivers discharge capacities of 314.8 mA h g−1, 282.8 mA h g−1, 245.3 mA h g−1, 212.6 mA h g−1, 192.8 mA h g−1, 181.0 mA h g−1, and 161.1 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, 0.2 A g−1, 0.3 A g−1, 0.5 A g−1, 0.8 A g−1, 1.0 A g−1 and 1.5 A g−1, respectively. Even at a high current density of 2.0 A g−1, a relatively high capacity of 148.7 mA h g−1 can still be retained. Besides, when the current density is set back to 0.1 A g−1, the AGC-NS electrode can still deliver a capacity of 316.2 mA h g−1, consistent with the fresh electrode, indicating a robust structure which can suffer repeated Na-ion insertion/extraction at various rates. As for the AGC electrode, the capacity at 2.0 A g−1 is merely 53.9 mA h g−1, far lower than that of the AGC-NS electrode. Besides, the capacity retention ratio of AGC at 2.0 A g−1 is 23.7% (capacity of AGC at 0.1 A g−1 is 227.7 mA h g−1), only half that of AGC-NS (47.2%), which sheds light on the improvement of the heteroatom doping strategy in promoting the kinetics.

(a) Schematic diagram of an SIB half-cell configuration, (b) Cycling performance at 100 mA g−1, (c) Galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles at the 200th cycle, (d) Rate capability from 0.1 A g−1 to 2.0 A g−1, (e) K+ diffusion coefficient based on GITT tests, and (f) Long-term cycling stability at 1.0 A g−1. 
Subsequently, GITT (galvanostatic intermittent titration technique) tests were introduced to evaluate the K-ion diffusion kinetics. The diffusion coefficient of K ions (Dk) can be calculated based on the following eqn (1):61–63 (1)where mB is the mass of the active material in the electrode, MB and VM are the molar mass and molar volume of the electrode material, and S is the geometric area of the electrode. Here, MB/VM can be obtained from the density of electrode materials. Other parameters can be obtained according to the charge/discharge profiles. The calculated diffusion coefficients are then plotted as a function of potassiation/de-potassiation depths (potential changes). As shown in Fig. 3e, the AGC-NS electrode exhibits a higher diffusion coefficient than those of AGC and AGC-N electrodes at all depths, which is also consistent with the enhanced rare capability of AGC-NS.
Based on the above results, promoted cyclability at high rates can be expected. As shown in Fig. 3f, after the activation process within the initial 50 cycles, the AGC-NS electrode shows a higher peak capacity of 205.5 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1, while AGC and AGC-N can only deliver 110.8 mA h g−1 and 160.2 mA h g−1, respectively. Moreover, after 2000 cycles, the AGC-NS electrode can maintain a high reversible capacity of 194.8 mA h g−1, corresponding to a high capacity retention ratio of 94.8%. As a contrast, the ratios of AGC and AGC-N are merely 73.6% (81.5 mA h g−1) and 81.2% (130.1 mA h g−1). Overall speaking, the wasted agarose derived carbonaceous materials and the heteroatom doping strategy jointly contribute to higher capacity, promoted kinetics and enhanced stability in SIBs.
As illustrated above, the agarose derived carbon shows unique properties of the amorphous structure, enlarged interlayer distance and defected surface, which signifies a superiority in transporting ions with a large radius. Therefore, the electrochemical performance was further evaluated in PIBs (Fig. 4a). The initial discharge capacities of AGC, AGC-N, and AGC-NS are 672.3 mA h g−1, 722.1 mA h g−1, and 855.5 mA h g−1 (Fig. 4b), which are higher than that of SIBs. However, the ICEs of AGC, AGC-N and AGC-NS are merely 32.41%, 32.18%, and 30.69% (Fig. S2†), corresponding to relatively lower reversible capacities compared to SIBs. After 200 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, the AGC-NS electrode can still maintain a relatively high capacity of 283.0 mA h g−1, while the AGC and AGC-N electrodes can only deliver 194.4 mA h g−1 and 232.3 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 4c). Besides, the AGC-NS electrode exhibits a satisfactory rate capability. Specifically, a high reversible capacity of 287.3 mA h g−1 is realized at 0.1 A g−1. Even at high current densities of 1.0 A g−1 and 2.0 A g−1, the AGC-NS electrode can still retain 147.0 mA h g−1 and 85.7 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 4d). Analogously, the GITT results further illustrate the enhanced K-ion transport kinetics in AGC-NS with higher diffusion coefficients (Fig. 4e). As for the high-rate cyclability at 1.0 A g−1, the AGC-NS electrode is still superior to the AGC and AGC-N electrodes, which can retain a high reversible capacity of 157.8 mA h g−1 (Fig. 4f), outmatching most of the reported carbonaceous electrode materials (Table S1†).53,64,65

With structure–performance correlations in SIB and PIB half cells preliminarily established, we subsequently introduced consecutive CV measurements to decipher the Na/K-ion storage behaviors and investigate the origin of the superior rate capability. Fig. 5a, b and S3a, b† show the profiles of AGC-x electrodes in SIBs. The obvious reduction peaks in the initial cycle should be ascribed to the formation of an SEI (solid electrolyte interphase) layer on the surface, which disappear in the subsequent cycles, indicating good stability. Similar results can be found in PIBs (Fig. 5d, e and S4a, b†), while the area of the initial irreversible reduction peaks is much larger than that in SIBs, indicating a very severe initial capacity loss which is consistent with the relatively lower ICEs. Consecutive CV measurements were conducted at a large range of scan rates from 0.1 mV s−1 to 2.0 mV s−1 (Fig. 5b, e, S3c, d, S4c and d). With scan rates increasing, both anodic and cathodic peaks tend to be broader. Besides, the anodic peak shifted to a higher potential, while the cathodic peak shifted to the opposite side, suggesting the coexistence of mixed diffusion-controlled and capacitive behaviors. To shed more light on this, we employed the following eqn (2) and (3) proposed by Dunn's group:66–68 i = avb(2) log(i) = blog(v) + log(a)(3)where a and b are adjustable constants, i the peak current, and v the scan rate. The b value could be determined by plotting log(i)-log(v) curves. Particularly, when the b value is close to 0.5, the electrochemical reaction is dominated by the diffusion-controlled process; as the b value approaches 1.0, the capacitive process (surface-driven behavior) predominates. In our cases, as plotted in Fig. 5c and f, b values at all selected potentials are in the range of 0.5 ∼ 1.0, indicating the existence of mixed behaviors. Specifically, the AGC-NS electrode delivers higher b values than AGC and AGC-N electrodes in both SIBs and PIBs. To quantify the mixed behaviors, eqn (4) and (5) are further introduced:66–68 i = k1v1/2 + k2v(4) (5)where k1 and k2 are constants, k1v1/2 represents the contribution of a diffusion-controlled reaction and k2v stands for the contribution from capacitive behavior. As shown in Fig. 5g, AGC-NS exhibits the highest capacitive ratios at all scan rates, illustrating the corresponding superior rate capability. Especially, at a relatively high scan rate of 2.0 mV s−1, the capacitive ratio of AGC-NS is over 70% in both SIBs and PIBs. Particularly, the capacitive ratios in PIBs are lower than those in SIBs, which should be ascribed to the feasible intercalation chemistry in PIBs, i.e., graphite can serve as anode materials for PIBs but not for SIBs. Generally speaking, the diffusion-controlled process is relatively sluggish with a flat charge/discharge platform, while the capacitive process indicates fast ion transport with sloping charge/discharge curves. As shown in Fig. 5h, the capacity contribution ratio below 0.5 V (stands for the diffusion-controlled process) in PIBs is higher than that in SIBs at various current densities, further supporting the results of consecutive CV measurements. In general, the as-synthesized AGC-x carbonaceous materials with an amorphous structure, an expanded interspace and abundant defective sites all boost the capacitive behavior, thus promoting the cyclability and enhancing the rate capability.

Considering the high availability and low cost of the wasted agarose and Na/K resources, evaluations over the practical prospect are quite essential. Therefore, we employed commercial Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP for short) and perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA for short) as cathode materials for SIB and PIB full cells (Fig. 6a and d), respectively. The as-received NVP secondary particle has a regular spherical morphology consisting of smaller primary particles (Fig. S5a and b†). The XRD pattern fits well with the standard NVP phase (Fig. S5c,† PDF#97-024-8140). In the NVP//Na half-cell, the CV profiles matches well in the initial three cycles and almost no capacity decay can be observed for 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 (Fig. S5d–f†). Consequently, based on the superior electrochemical performance of both the AGC-NS anode and NVP cathode, the as-fabricated Na-ion full cell can still deliver a high reversible capacity of 243.5 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles, corresponding to a high capacity retention ratio of 80% (Fig. 6b and c). The as-received PTCDA has a micro sized rod-like morphology and fits well with the standard phases (Fig. S6a–c†). In the PTCDA//K half-cell, CV profile of the 2nd cycle also fits well with the 3rd cycle, and a high capacity retention ratio of 91.6% can be achieved (Fig. S6d–f†). Therefore, the as-assembled K-ion full cell also delivers good cyclability with a high reversible capacity of 194.4 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles (Fig. 6e and f, capacity retention ratio of ∼76%). Moreover, the Na/K-ion full cells can light LED lights, demonstrating the practical prospects (Fig. 6g and h).

3. Conclusions
In summary, we propose a “trash to treasure” concept for utilizing the wasted agarose gel as a precursor to fabricate high performance anode materials for next generation low-cost sodium and potassium ion batteries. The agarose derived carbon materials deliver unique properties like amorphous structures, expanded interspace and abundant defective sites, which all contribute to the fast and stable Na/K-ion storage. With consecutive CV measurements, we further shed light on the K-ion storage behaviors and the origin of the enhanced ion transport kinetics. Besides, the as-synthesized carbons also exhibit a promising prospect in the practical energy storage systems of Na/K-ion full cells. This work may broaden the horizons in searching for suitable precursors for developing large-scale energy storage devices. The investigations on structure–performance correlations in this work will deepen the understanding of carbon-based electrode materials for various batteries like Na/K/Zn-ion capacitors, Li–O2/CO2 batteries, and fuel cells. Furthermore, interdisciplinary cooperation between a bio lab and a battery lab may also be inspired and boosted.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Preparation of AGC-x
First, the wasted agarose gel was treated with a freeze-drying process. Secondly, the collected fluffy and white sponge was subjected to high-energy ball milling at 400 rpm for 12 h under Ar protection. Subsequently, the as-obtained white powder was mixed with thiourea at a fixed mass ratio (2:1) and an extra 1 h of ball milling was introduced to ensure thorough mixing. Finally, the mixture was pyrolyzed at 900 °C for 2 h and washed with deionized water three times. The collected black powder was denoted as AGC-NS. Correspondingly, the final product without thiourea was denoted as AGC, while the final product with urea instead of thiourea was denoted as AGC-N. The carbon yield is ∼20 wt%.
4.2 Materials characterization
The morphology and microstructure were characterized by FESEM (ZEISS SUPRA 55) and HRTEM (JEOL JEM-3200FS). The phase structure was determined through XRD (Bruker D8 Advanced) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at a scan rate of 10° min−1. Raman spectra were collected on a Renishaw inVia confocal Raman microscope using a 532 nm laser as the excitation source.
4.3 Electrochemical measurements
The working electrodes were prepared by mixing 80 wt% active materials, 10 wt% Super P as the conductive additive and 10 wt% PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) as the binder. PVDF (concentration: 3 wt%) was pre-dissolved in NMP (N-methyl pyrrolidone) solvent before being used as the binder. The as-obtained homogeneous slurry was then coated onto the copper foil (aluminum foil for cathode) and dried at 90 °C in a vacuum oven for 10 h to evaporate the solvent. Circular electrodes with a diameter of 14 mm (12 mm for cathode) were obtained using a punch machine. The half cells (CR2032 coin cell) were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box (H2O < 0.1 ppm, O2 < 0.1 ppm) with metallic potassium (sodium for SIBs) as the counter electrode. A Whatman GF/C glass fiber was employed as the separator. The electrolyte for PIBs was 3.0 M KFSI solution dissolved in DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane). The electrolyte for SIBs was 1.0 M NaClO4 solution dissolved in EC/PC (1:1 by volume) with 5.0% FEC. The volume of electrolyte for each coin cell is ∼200 μL. As for Na-ion full cells, the anode was pre-cycled for three cycles. As for K-ion full cells, the anode was pre-cycled for two cycles and kept at the fully potassiated status before the full-cell assembly. The galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were conducted using a LAND-CT2001A multichannel galvanostat (Wuhan, China) at room temperature. The CV profiles were obtained at various scan rates on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760e, CH Instruments). GITT (galvanostatic intermittent titration technique) tests were conducted under repeated current pulse (20 mA g−1, 10 min) and relaxation (30 min).
