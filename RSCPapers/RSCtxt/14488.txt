    , Accepted 12th March 2019First published on 12th March 2019AbstractOwing to the excellent abundance and availability of sodium reserves, sodium ion batteries (NIBs) show great promise for meeting the material supply and cost demands of large-scale energy storage systems (ESSs) used for the application of renewable energy sources and smart grids. However, the cost advantages of stationary NIBs alone are not enough to ensure their commercial success. In this review, we summarize the emerging attractive characteristics of stationary NIBs, such as high-rate capability, all-climate operation, and full-battery recyclability. Together with inherent cost advantages, these merits have resulted in an excellent compatibility between stationary NIBs and large-scale ESSs that dictates their validity in practical applications. Representative electrode materials are highlighted to illustrate advances in corresponding features. The insights presented in this review can inspire further research interest into NIB design and serve as a guide for the application of NIBs in large-scale stationary energy storage.
1 Introduction
Innovations in energy access bring enormous opportunities and challenges to the energy industry.1 Electrical power is the backbone of modern industrial society, with versatile applications, such as in heating, lighting, transport, and communication.2 Most electrical power has traditionally been derived from the combustion of non-renewable fossil fuels, which presents well-known problems, including reserve depletion and global warming.3 Recently, electrical generation has been altered by the emergence of renewable energy technologies.4 Various renewable and clean energy sources, such as solar and wind energy, have been developed as complementary or alternative technologies to prevailing fossil fuels in modern society.5 However, renewable energy is generated intermittently, leading to an irregular electricity supply to the grid.6–8 However, electricity utilization in offices, industry, transportation, and homes is periodic in both time and region. Therefore, large-scale energy storage systems (ESSs) are particularly important for the scaled-up utilization of renewable energy technologies,9–11 as shown in Fig. 1.

Among energy storage technologies, rechargeable batteries have attracted intensive research interest in ESS construction owing to their intrinsic features of high round-trip efficiency, long cycling, and ease of maintenance.12–14 Unlike energy storage for mobile electronics (∼4 W h) and electrified transportation (∼40 kW h), ESSs must offer the ability to store MW h capacities that are large enough to meet renewable energy and smart grid demands.15 Such large-scale electricity storage requires the production of extremely large batteries, causing material abundance, battery cost, and safety to become the primary issues.16 In addition to the above issues, the commercial success of ESSs generally relies on opportunities to generate income.17 ESSs are desired to be utilized in the energy market as load-levelling devices18 (Fig. 1). Examples include ancillary services that facilitate the integration of wind and solar energy into grids and enhance grid resilience through peak regulation between day and night.19 Therefore, stationary batteries must be well-suited to targeted ESS applications. In this context, the key metrics of stationary batteries for ESS applications must first be reviewed.
Firstly, applications that shift energy in a timely fashion and harvest renewable energy are comparatively more energy intensive. This requires stationary batteries with sufficient energy densities and low self-discharge behavior.
Secondly, frequent peak regulation within seconds or minutes is a relatively short-duration process needed to conciliate momentary differences between demand and supply. This favors a fast response, requiring stationary batteries with alternate high-rate charging and discharging in rapid succession.
Thirdly, battery charging/discharging operations must stable in all climates. The electrochemical behavior of stationary batteries must be independent of ambient temperature as much as possible.
Finally, ESS applications inevitably produce massively end-of-life batteries. The environmentally friendly disposal of waste batteries to avoid incurring costs is a prescient product design consideration.
To this end, several promising battery candidates, such as lead–acid batteries (LABs), lithium-based batteries, and sodium-based batteries, have been intensively investigated by the battery community and research institutes to confirm their compatibility with ESS applications.6,20 As a 100-year-old battery system, LABs have already seen significant progress in low-cost and heavily regulated operation. However, the key drawback of LABs is insufficient energy density.21 In contrast, lithium-based batteries, such as lithium ion batteries22 (LIBs) and lithium–sulfur batteries23 (LSBs), have high energy densities. However, the large-scale application of MW h-class LIBs is challenged by resource availability, because lithium is unevenly distributed and of limited abundance in Earth's mineral resources. Identified lithium reserves are only 14.3 Mt according to United States Geological Survey data for 2016. Furthermore, most accessible global lithium reserves are in remote or politically sensitive areas, such as Chile (52%) and Argentina (14%),24,25 resulting in high risk and transport costs in the lithium supply. Remaining lithium reserves, such as in China (22%) and Australia (11%), are unable to meet the increased demand of ESS applications. If such a path was pursued, Li recycling would be necessary.26–29 These adverse factors make lithium-based batteries utilization in ESSs difficult and costly. Furthermore, other chemical energy storage technologies, such as supercapacitors (SCs) and redox-flow batteries (RFBs) have been fully evaluated. SCs have the evident advantage of high power, having strong short-duration operation ability to help regulate the grid peak. However, SCs suffer from low energy density and high self-discharge loss.12 Unlike SCs, RFBs have advantages of design and operational flexibility, very small self-discharge ratios, high safety, and long lifespans. However, the whole RFB system is limited to low efficiency because partial energy is required to drive liquid flow.20
Alternatively, sodium is well-known for its abundant reserves and wide distribution.30–32 The elemental abundance of sodium is 1000 times that of lithium. Furthermore, sodium salt supplies are readily available. The United States alone produces 23 billion tons of soda ash, which far exceeds the global yield of lithium salts. Consequently, the cost of sodium salts is much lower than that of lithium analogues (for example, $0.50 kg−1 Na2CO3vs. $6.50 kg−1 Li2CO3).30 Therefore, the cost and resource advantages of sodium encourage innovations in sodium-based batteries.33 A representative sodium-based battery technology was successfully commercialized in high-temperature Na/S batteries (HT-NSBs) in the 1980s.34 The NGK Company has installed HT-NSBs at nearly 200 locations worldwide to deliver a cumulative installation base of 3700 MW h. However, HT-NSBs require relatively high temperatures (∼300 °C) to keep the electrolyte in a molten state, which represents a chemical hazard to safe operations and causes severe corrosion problems. Regrettably, in 2011, a fire accident at NGK Company reduced confidence in HT-NSBs. Regardless, resources and technological demonstrations of sodium-based batteries provide a promising outlook.32 Compared with HT-NSBs, room-temperature stationary sodium ion batteries (NIBs) are a safer alternative for ESS applications,35–37 and have received increasing research interest in the past decade.
Inspired by these factors, much effort has been devoted toward developing cathodes, anodes, electrolytes, and other battery accessories for NIBs. Corresponding reviews have significantly aided the understanding of NIB fundamentals and reaction mechanisms.38–49 However, the compatibility between NIBs and ESSs, which dictates their validity in practical applications, is unambiguous. In this review, we summarize NIB features for ESS applications, as follows: (i) low-cost resource: precursor materials for stationary NIBs are extremely abundant and highly accessible, meeting material-supply and cost requirements; (ii) high-power performance: high electric and ionic conductivity of the electrode materials allows high-rate operation, endowing stationary NIBs with a fast response to conciliate electricity demand and supply; (iii) all-climate adaptability: NIBs can operate under various climatic conditions, exhibiting excellent flexibility and reliability, even with the failure of internal and external heaters to maintain the battery temperature; (iv) full-battery recyclability: NIBs are recyclable, not only avoiding environmental pollution and the ecological impact of waste batteries, but also minimizing the demand for critical raw resources through closed-loop recycling of valuable electrode materials.
In this review, the compatibility between the NIBs and ESSs is fully discussed. Representative electrode materials are intentionally extracted for mechanistic illustrations of the corresponding features and advancements. We also provide a comprehensive outlook and perspective on NIB recyclability and the major opportunities and challenges in applying stationary NIBs in ESSs. A prescient design principle for the electrode materials and battery framework is proposed to improve the features of NIBs and make them more competitive in the ESS market. Only by understanding the decisive features and manipulating the advantages of NIBs, practically viable ESSs based on NIBs can certainly be achieved.
2 Cost advantages of stationary NIBs
ESS applications require large-scale battery installations.50 Battery cost is of vital importance in determining the economic feasibility of ESS applications in renewable energy and smart grids,31 with cost-effective battery technology a preferred choice.6 The cost proportion of a typical battery is shown in Fig. 2.51 The battery cost is mainly dependent on the selected electrode materials, organic electrolyte, and separator. Cathode materials account for around one third of the total battery cost, which are the most value battery component, regardless of LIBs and NIBs. Therefore, the cathode cost plays a key role in the whole battery cost. In general, the cathode consists of carrying ions, transition metals, or organic electrode materials. In this respect, sodium has several advantages compared with lithium because sodium compounds are versatile and can be investigated as electrode materials. Furthermore, cell accessories for NIBs are likely to use more economical materials than LIBs.

2.1 Sodium resource abundance
Sodium salts, such as NaCl, Na2CO3, and Na2SO4, are available and accessible from brine, seawater, and minerals.32 The utilization of sodium instead of lithium should apparently lead to a pronounced cost saving. However, this conclusion is based on sole electrode materials rather than the whole battery. Vaalma et al. established a model for battery performance and cost to break down the battery cost and evaluate the influence of different electrode ingredients on cost (Fig. 2).51 For a capacity of 11.5 kW h, the LIB cathode requires 6734 g of Li2CO3 as lithium source. According to an average price of US$6.5 kg−1 in 2015, the total lithium cost is $44. If the LIB is also designed using a LiMn2O4 cathode and graphite anode, the material cost of $1022, with lithium accounting for ∼4.3% of the total material cost. For NIBs using a Mn-based cathode, the cost of sodium is only $4.57, corresponding to a cost saving of $38.95. Therefore, a ∼4% cost reduction in the cathode can be achieved by replacing Li with Na.
In addition to cathode materials, the electrolyte salts also contain carrying ions that allow ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode.52 As for the cathode, substituting Na with Li indicates a cost reduction in the electrolyte. However, the electrolyte often consists of 1.0–1.2 M electrolyte salts (such as LiPF6 or NaPF6) and mixed organic solvents (such as ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate). Normally, electrolyte salt accounts for 10–20 wt% of the total electrolyte.26 The mixed organic solvents are identical for LIBs and NIBs. Consequently, using the Na alternative to Li in the electrolyte results in a negligible cost saving. As shown in Fig. 2, the electrolytes in LIBs and NIBs have similar costs, indicating less than a 1% cost decrease. In total, the cumulative saving is around 5% of battery cost when lithium is replaces with sodium. This conclusion is in agreement with the cost analysis of NIBs by Kim et al.53
2.2 Cheap transition metals
Transition metals are key in constructing electrode materials,54–56 facilitating reducible/oxidizable processes along with Na ion insertion/extraction, respectively. The abundance and accessibility of transition metals favors the low cost of electrode materials. Encouragingly, Na ions have a bigger size gap to transition metals than Li ions with respect to ionic radii.57 For example, the Na+ cation (1.02 Å) is much larger than the Fe3+ cation (0.645 Å), compared with the Li+ cation (0.76 Å). This feature is advantageous for the fabrication of electrode materials. Iron, manganese, and vanadium are abundant transition metals for electrode materials, especially iron, which is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. However, owing to the similar size of Fe3+ (0.645 Å) and Li+ (0.76 Å) cations, cation mixing occurs readily in layered LiFeO2, resulting in a cation-disordered rock-salt phase and electrochemically inert properties.46 Therefore, alternative phosphate structures have been developed for these budget transition metals, such as LiFePO4, LiMnPO4, and Li3V2(PO4)3. The key drawback of these materials is the synthesis process, which requires an inert atmosphere, resulting in relatively high costs and material inconsistency.
In contrast to lithium ion compounds, sodium iron compounds with layered structures are stable. The sodium storage performance of NaFeO2 was first reported by Okada et al.58 NaFeO2 is an O3-phase layered oxide, with the resultant electrode delivering a reversible capacity of 85 mA h g−1 at a stable voltage plateau of 3.3 V. The electrochemical activity is derived from the Fe3+/Fe4+ redox couple. Similarly, Na0.44MnO2 also exhibits outstanding electrochemical capability and cycling stability.59 Furthermore, iron-based binary compounds, such as P2-Na2/3[Fe1/2Mn1/2]O2,60,61 and ternary systems, such as P2-Na7/9Cu2/9Fe1/9Mn2/3O2,62 have been widely reported to have excellent electrochemical behaviors.63 Therefore, NaxMO2 (M = Mn and Fe) has been demonstrated to have electrochemical activities. These NaxMO2 materials can be prepared under the air conditions, which provides cost advantages and simple synthetic processes for NIB electrode materials (Fig. 3).

Other than layered metal oxides, phosphate compounds with open three-dimensional (3D) structures, such as Na super ionic conductor (NASICON), are also more likely to accommodate large Na+ cations than small Li+ cations.64 Fe2(MoO4)3 or Fe2(WO4)3 have been inserted with sodium to yield two new compounds, Na2Fe2(MoO4)3 or Na2Fe2(WO4)3, respectively.65 Bruce et al. identified reversible sodium insertion/desertion with retention of the monoclinic symmetry. Both electrodes showed voltages of 2.7 V vs. Na+/Na. Furthermore, vanadium-based compounds43,66 such as Na3V2(PO4)3,67 Na3V2(PO4)2O2F3,68 and Na4MnV(PO4)369 have been extensively explored as electrode materials in NIBs. Carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 nanowalls, constructed by Li et al. through a facile hydrothermal method, exhibited an excellent rate performance with a small decrease in specific capacity from 114.8 to 94.9 mA h g−1 when the current density was increased from 0.1 to 5C.67 Notably, for Na and Li versions of the same compound, the phosphate compounds were easily prepared under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions,70 allowing the simple and low-cost fabrication of electrode materials. Therefore, these Fe-/Mn-/V-based electrode materials substantially contribute to decreasing NIB costs, regardless of the material cost and fabrication process.
2.3 Sustainable organic materials
Organic materials have recently been explored as electrode materials for NIBs.71,72 Their redox reactions are mainly enabled by a charge state change of the electroactive organic groups or moieties.73 Organic electrode materials for NIBs are largely classified as aromatic carbonyl compounds, pteridine derivatives, polymer sulfates, and doped or porous polymers. Compared with inorganic materials, organic materials have several natural merits for NIB electrodes.74 Firstly, their material sustainability and environmental benignity are improved compared with inorganic counterparts.75 Organic materials are often derived from natural materials through simple chemical or thermal treatments. Furthermore, most biomolecules in organic formulas are based on Na cations, offering a variety of electrode material candidates. The carbonyl group is by far the most applied organic functional moiety in organic materials. Wang et al. reported that carbonyl-based organic salt Na2C6O6 was synthesized through a facile antisolvent method.76 Na2C6O6 nanorods exhibited a reversible capacity of ∼190 mA h g−1 at 0.1C with over 90% capacity retention after 100 cycles. This result demonstrates the accessibility of biomass-derived organic electrode materials to sustainable energy storage devices with low cost, high electrochemical performance, and thermal stability (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Proposed working principles of organic electrodes in NIBs with three types of reaction. Type 1 is CO reactions: (a) quinone compounds with benzoquinone (BQ); (b) carboxylates with disodium terephthalate (Na2TP); (c) anhydrides with 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTCDA); and (d) imides with 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylicdiimide (HNDI). Type 2 is doping reactions: (e) organic radical compounds of poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy-4-vinylmethacrylate); (f) conductive polymers of polypyrrole; (g) a microporous polymer active site; (h) organometallic ferrocene-based polymer. Type 3 is CN reactions: (i) Schiff-based compound and (j) pteridine derivatives. Reproduced with permission from ref. 73 Copyright 2017, Wiley-VCH. 
Secondly, organic electrode materials have an obvious cost saving in materials modification. Organic materials that are mainly composed of naturally abundant elements (C, H, O, N, S) have tunable functional groups, making tailoring of their redox properties and electrochemical performances easier. Furthermore, organic materials can be readily bonded to conductive carbon-based materials, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, through conjugated systems, achieving improved rate performance, reduced compound solubility, and extended cycling lifespan.77,78 Gu et al. prepared a sandwich-like Na4C6O6–graphene composite using commercial Na2C6O6 through a simple hydrothermal approach.79 This architecture exhibited a high reversible capacity of 488 mA h g−1, good cycling performance, and high-rate properties for sodium storage (151 and 95 mA h g−1 at 744 and 3720 mA g−1, respectively). A similar attempt was made by Kim et al.80 Organic active materials were encapsulated into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to form an electrode with high active polymer content. These CNTs retain the active polymer within the electrode structure, providing an effective electronic conduction path. Furthermore, the CNTs can contain large amounts of active polymer and, therefore, exhibit superior electrochemical properties without self-discharge, making them well-suited for use as cathode materials in NIBs. Zhao et al. also reported using sodium terephthalate to stepwise replace oxygen atoms in carboxylate groups with sulfur atoms, which improved the electron delocalization, electrical conductivity, and sodium uptake capacity.81 The carboxylate scaffold with two sulfur atoms introduced reached a reversible capacity of 466 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1. When four sulfur atoms were introduced, the capacity increased to 567 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1. Therefore, the utilization of organic electrode materials greatly benefits function-oriented NIB design without requiring complicated modifications.
2.4 Economical cell components
NIB components, such as separators and current collectors, are cheaper than their LIB counterparts.45 The separator functions as electronic insulation between the cathode and anode. Owing to the larger atomic radius of Na compared with that of Li, the traditional polypropylene (PP) separator in LIBs cannot provide sufficient space for Na+ ions to pass through. As an alternative separator, glass fiber has a larger spacing and is commonly used in NIBs. The cost of glass fiber is only $0.3 m−2, which is much cheaper than that of PP in LIBs ($1 m−2). Therefore, the separator cost is approx. 10% lower for NIBs compared with LIBs. Furthermore, aluminum does not alloy with sodium, so aluminum can be used as an anode current collector instead of copper. The price of 15 μm-thick aluminum foil is only one-quarter that of 10 μm-thick copper foil ($0.3 m−2 and $1.2 m−2, respectively). Therefore, replacing copper with aluminum theoretically achieves a cost reduction of approx. 4.3%.
Electrode materials recycled from spent LIBs are much cheaper than the fresh electrode materials. Using cathodes (LiCoO2, LiNixCoyMnzO2, and LiFePO4) from recycled LIBs in new LIBs has been widely performed.82–84 Recycled cathodes showed performances similar to fresh materials. Similarly, anodes, such as graphite, have been successfully recycled and remanufactured.85 In particular, the direct regeneration of electrode materials uses less energy and raw materials without a complex preparation process, resulting in less emissions and waste, and cost savings from compliance with air-pollution regulations and disposal fees.86 Therefore, battery recycling is promising for reducing battery costs. We provide more information on the potential for NIB recycling in Section 5.

Section summary. 
We have briefly reviewed the cost advantages of NIBs compared with LIBs with respect to current electrode materials and technologies. The substitution of Li with Na is not solely capable of significantly decreasing battery cost. Furthermore, this advantage can, to some extent, be neutralized by the relatively low energy density of NIBs. In contrast, the potential cost savings associated with NIBs are greatly facilitated by the utilization of cheap transition metals and organic materials. Furthermore, NIBs can use more economical cell components compared with LIBs. Table 1 shows an illustrative example of battery component changes from LIB to NIBs. According to data from the London Metal Exchange in February 2018, the price of iron is only 1% that of cobalt ($340 vs. $33000 by ton). Therefore, NaFeO2 is expected to be lower in cost than LiCoO2. According to Fig. 2, the cathode accounts for one third of the total materials cost. Therefore, substituting LiCoO2 with NaFeO2 represents an approx. 30% cost saving. Furthermore, battery recycling can contribute substantially to reducing materials costs. The anode often accounts for around 20% of materials costs. If such a path is pursued, the cost reduction from LIBs to NIBs could be up to 50%. Therefore, the insightful design of stationary NIBs will become increasingly attractive.

3 Power advantages of stationary NIBs
Both electricity demand and supply in power grids vary by time and region, as shown in Fig. 1. Such frequent fluctuations not only cause safety concerns on grids, but also result in electricity loss. To avoid this scenario, large-scale ESSs can be deployed to perform two key functions, namely, modulate intermittent renewable sources and regulate grids through peak shifting. Fig. 5 shows the discharge time and power rating for various energy storage technologies. Traditional pumped hydro and compressed air energy storage technologies have a long response process. In addition, high-power SCs enable fast responses within seconds while suffering from low energy densities. Therefore, stationary batteries are the most suitable for ESSs, with such speculation having been strongly validated. Recently, NIBs with high-power performance with long cycling were reported. The highest rate for NIBs was recorded at 500C according to Yang et al.,87 and was close to that of commonly used SCs. Therefore, NIBs can be fully charged or discharged within 7.2 s, enabling a quick response to voltage fluctuations in the grid. Such high-power operation is of critical importance for ESS applications to renewable energy sources and smart grids.

In this section, we summarize recent high-rate processes in electrode materials involving layered metal oxides, NASICON-type compounds, carbon-based composites, and alloy-type materials. High-rate operation in battery systems requires a unique electrode that combines a material with high ionic and electric conductivity and an architecture with fast ionic and electric diffusion.88–91 The former is often the focus for rational modifications of electrode materials.92–94 The latter is critically required for creative electrode architectures, such as 3D frameworks, high-performance binders, and innovative electrode designs.95–97 We have also highlighted the importance of advanced battery design in achieving high-power NIB technologies.
3.1 Layered transition metal oxides with high rate behaviors
Using layered metal oxides as hosts is the most extensively studied topic in NIB research. From LIB research, rational modifications of layered electrode materials significantly enhances their electrochemical behavior in high-rate operation. For example, the reaction kinetics can be boosted using a medium layer98 and by controlling the morphology size.99 Among single-metal Na-intercalation oxides, NaxMO2 (M = Co, Mn, Fe, Cr, and Ni), NaCrO2 modified with a carbon coating by Yu et al. exhibited excellent capacity retention with superior rate capability up to 150C, corresponding to a full charge or discharge in 27 s.100 When assembled by NaCrO2 cathode and hard carbon anode, full NIBs also enable a high current density with a rate of 100C. Furthermore, Dong et al. applied the topotactically synthetic method to obtain novel hierarchical zigzag layered Na1.25V3O8 nanowires. Excellent electrochemical performance was achieved with high capacity (158.7 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1) and cycling stability (capacity fading of 0.0138% per cycle at 1 A g−1 for 1000 cycles).101
Binary or ternary transition metals in layered oxides based on Ni, Fe, Mn, and Co have been also explored in recent years. Hwang et al. focused on designing heterogeneous structures for electrode materials. Spoke-like nanorods of Na[Ni0.61Co0.12Mn0.27]O2 were assembled in spherical secondary particles. Such cathode nanorods featured a high discharge capacity of 130 mA h g−1 at 10C.102 Similarly, a spherical particle consisting of a radially aligned hierarchical columnar structure of O3-Na[Ni0.58Co0.06Mn0.36]O2 has also been reported. This cathode exhibited a rate capacity of 132.6 mA h g−1 at 10C and a capacity retention of 80% at 125 mA h g−1 during 300 cycles in combination with a hard carbon anode.103 These examples demonstrate the potential of NIBs for meeting the high-rate requirements of ESS applications.

3.2 NASICON-type materials with high rate behaviors
Na Super Ionic Conductor (NASICON) materials have been applied in NIB cathodes and anodes. The general formula of NASICON materials is NaxMM′(XO4)3 (M/M′ = V, Ti, Fe and Nb; X = P, or S, x = 0–4). The NASICON-type framework is constructed of corner-shared MO6 (M′O6) and polyhedral XO4 groups. Such an open framework provides sufficient space for Na ion diffusion channels.114 To date, massive NASICON-type materials have been investigated for sodium storage properties, such as Na3V2(PO4)3,115 Na3V2(PO4)2O2F3,116 NaTi2(PO4)3,117 NaZr2(PO4)3,118 NaSn2(PO4)3,119 Na3MnTi(PO4)3,120 and Fe2(MoO4)3,121 which exhibited superior ionic conductivity and stable crystalline structures.122 These high-rate materials have been summarized in Table 3. A family of vanadium-based and titanium-based materials is of particular interest, affording NIBs with high-rate performance surpassing that of LIBs (Fig. 6).

Na3V2(PO4)3 is a representative NASICON-type material that has attracted much attention in the modification of NIB electrodes. Despite high ionic conductivity, Na3V2(PO4)3 has low electronic conductivity owing to the separation of metal polyhedra and strong electronegativity of anions in the polyanionic structure.123 Modifications involving coating the electronically conductive medium without affecting ion access and tailoring the morphology size to the shorten ionic diffusion distance are procedures of choice aimed at boosting rate performance. Mai et al. have devoted much effort toward improving the rate performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 in a series of important guiding reports. Xu et al. synthesized layer-by-layer Na3V2(PO4)3 embedded in reduced graphene oxide. Such a heterogeneous Na3V2(PO4)3-based composite can afford rates of up to 200C with close to 50% of the theoretical capacity.124 A novel 3D Na3V2(PO4)3 nanofiber network was constructed by Ren et al. using a facile self-sacrificed template method.125 Owing to the formation of a 3D nanofiber network structure, which provides multi-channel ionic diffusion pathway, continuous electronic conduction, and improved structural integrity, as-prepared Na3V2(PO4)3 composite exhibited excellent cyclability (95.9% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 10C) and high-rate performance (94 mA h g−1 at 100C).
Other research groups have also performed excellent Na3V2(PO4)3 studies, confirming their potential in high-rate NIBs. Zhang et al. prepared 3D-skeleton carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 using a novel soft template approach.126 This cathode material exhibited a discharge capacity of 113 mA h g−1 at 1C, which was very close to the theoretical capacity (117 mA h g−1). The capacity retention was 87.5% after 8000 cycles at 2C and the discharge capacity was maintained at about 60 mA h g−1 at 50C. Furthermore, Fang et al. used chemical vapor deposition on pure Na3V2(PO4)3 particles. The resulting hierarchical carbon-framework-wrapped Na3V2(PO4)3 composite delivered a close-to-theoretical reversible capacity at 0.2C (115 mA h g−1), superior high-rate capability (38 mA h g−1 at 500C), and ultra-long cycling stability (54% capacity retention after 20000 cycles at 30C).87 NIBs with such high-power and long-cycling performance similar to that of supercapacitors are of great significance for addressing the urgent issues of intermittent supply from renewable energy and power fluctuation in smart grids.
For NIB anodes, NaTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles embedded in 3D graphene networks have successfully been prepared using a hydrothermal method.127 Porous NaTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles (approx. 100 nm) were homogenously distributed within the graphene network, resulting in a high rate capability (67 mA h g−1 at 50C) and long cycling life (80% capacity retention after 1000 cycles). Another similar example was reported by Roh et al. using a microwave-assisted one-pot method to prepare well-crystallized NaTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles (30–40 nm) uniformly precipitated on rGO templates through Ti–O–C bonds.128 Chemical interactions between the NaTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles and rGO immobilized the NaTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles on the rGO sheets, which might be responsible for the excellent electrochemical performance of the nanocomposite. The NaTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite exhibited an excellent rate capability (93.7 mA h g−1 at 50C) and long cycling performance (only 4.5% capacity loss after 1000 cycles at a high rate of 10C). Furthermore, Wang et al. designed an architecture of NaTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles embedded in the mesoporous carbon matrix that was realized using a facile sol–gel method. The resulting anode exhibited superior rate capability, with a capacity of up to 56 mA h g−1 at 20C (4 A g−1) and capacity retention of 68% after 10000 cycles. Furthermore, Guo et al. reported a facile two-step strategy for constructing a flexible and binder-free NaTi2(PO4)3/graphene film with a sandwich structure.129 The NaTi2(PO4)3/graphene hybrid was embedded homogeneously in an interconnected graphene nanosheet framework to form a 3D flexible GN/NaTi2(PO4)3/GN film. The resultant film exhibited outstanding cycling stability (91% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 500 mA g−1). Furthermore, a polyanionic Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode exhibited an excellent capacity of 75 mA h g−1 at an ultrahigh rate of 70C (1C = 128 mA g−1) and a long lifespan of 3500 cycles at 30C while retaining 79% of the initial capacity value.130
3.3 Carbon-based materials with high rate behaviors
Graphite, which is commonly applied in LIBs, is rarely used in NIB anodes owing to the absence of stable Na–C binary compounds.42 Experimental and theoretical studies also indicated that the formation of sodium-rich binary graphite intercalation compounds (b-GIC) was thermodynamically disfavored.143 Therefore, for the carbon–ester electrolyte, sodium ions were mainly adsorbed in the interface between electrode materials, only delivering a capacity of around 35 mA h g−1. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that Na ions can be inserted into the graphite interlayer through the suitable selection of electrolyte solvents.144 Adelhelm et al. observed a so-called cointercalation reaction in a diglyme-based electrolyte, achieving a low-overpotential sodium storage of about 100 mA h g−1 with >1000 cycles in the graphite anode.145,146 This was attributed to solvated ions that can easily enter the graphite lattice and rapidly diffuse, simultaneously leading to graphite exfoliation to form platelets. Another strategy is to expand the interlayer spacing through a process of oxidation and partial reduction on graphite. The expanded graphite had an enlarged interlayer lattice distance of 4.3 Å, but retained a long-range-ordered layered structure analogous to that of graphite. The resultant anode delivered a high reversible capacity of 284 mA h g−1 at a current density of 20 mA g−1 (Fig. 7).147

In addition to the incremental capacity of graphite, the rate improvements attracted more attention to NIB anodes. Disordered carbon materials, such as hard carbon, have been widely investigated as alternative anodes in NIBs. Stevens and Dahn compared the storage behavior of lithium and sodium in hard carbon.148 In contrast to Li ion insertion/deinsertion to the disordered graphene layers in LIBs, sodium ions were mainly adsorbed on the surface of hard carbon with an organic carbon–ester electrolyte. Therefore, the design of micro/nanostructures in hard carbon materials is critical to achieve fast reaction kinetics. Xiao et al. confirmed that nanosized hard carbon nanoparticles (HCNP) exhibited a high specific capacity (270 mA h g−1 at the current density of 50 mA g−1 in the voltage range of 0–1.2 V), remarkable cycling lifespan (77% capacity retention over 500 cycles), and high rate capability (45 mA h g−1 at 2.5 A g−1).149 A similar effort was reported by Lu et al. using a facile NaCl-template-assisted method to obtain amorphous carbon with high electronic conductivity and a high surface area. Consequently, such 3D amorphous carbon (3DAC) with controlled porosity and disordered structures exhibited an excellent rate capability (66 mA h g−1 at 9.6 A g−1) and a high reversible capacity (280 mA h g−1 at a low current density of 30 mA g−1).150
In addition to hard carbon, examples of high-rate NIB anodes using high-surface-area graphene composites have been reported. Defects in graphene can provide massive sites for sodium storage. Li et al. demonstrated the surface capacitive contribution of graphene-based materials to achieve high-rate NIB anodes.151 Surface-induced capacitive processes (SCP), such as capacitance and pseudocapacitance, can provide fast charge/discharge capacity in conjunction with the capacity provided by diffusion-controlled intercalation processes (DIP). The resulting SCP-enhanced NIB delivered an outstanding rate capacity of 120 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1, and exceptional cycling stability, retaining 83.5% capacity of 142 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 2500 cycles. To further enhance the electric conductivity, Xu et al. used cellulose/polyaniline composites as precursors to prepare N and S-codoped carbon microspheres (NSC-SP). This NSC-SP anode exhibited a high capacity (∼280 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1), superior rate capability (∼130 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1), and a long cycle life of more than 3000 cycles.152 To date, disordered carbon materials as NIB anodes have exhibited excellent properties, including high rates and long cycling stability.

3.4 Alloy- and conversion-type electrode materials with high rate behaviors
As for carbon-based materials, alloy and conversion-type electrode materials also exhibit excellent rate performance, favoring high-power NIBs. Electrode materials have been based on alloy reactions with metals (such as Sn, Pb, and Bi) and metalloids (such as Si, Ge, and P).163 Duan et al. fabricated ultra-small antimony (Sb) nanoparticles embedded in a 3D nitrogen-doped porous carbon matrix through self-wrapping and controlled growth processes using chitosan as a self-wrapping precursor. The nanocomposite exhibited a reversible capacity of 138 mA h g−1 at a very high current density of 32 A g−1 and a capacity of 372 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g−1.164 Similarly, Xie et al. developed a 3D hierarchical Sn@CNT nanopillar array grown perpendicularly on carbon paper as a free-standing electrode. The electrode achieved a reversible capacity of 887 mA h cm−2 in the first cycle and good cyclability until 100 cycles.165 Chen et al. reported a bismuth-intercalated graphite (Bi@graphite) anode material,166 where Bi nanoparticles between graphite interlayers enhanced the capacity and the graphite sheath provided a robust fast electronic connection for long cycling stability. Bi@graphite possessed a safe average storage potential of approximately 0.5 V vs. Na/Na+, delivered a capacity of 160 mA h g−1 at 1C, exhibited outstanding cycling stability (approx. 90% capacity retention for 10000 cycles at 20C), and maintain 70% capacity at 300C (∼110 mA h g−1 at 48 A g−1), which was equivalent to full charge/discharge in 12 s. Conversion reactions for sodium storage involve metal oxides (TiO2, Co3O4, SnO2, and Nb2O5), sulfides (SnS, FeS, and MoS2), phosphides, and selenides.48 Chen et al. showed that intimate integration of graphene with TiO2 enhanced the Na+ intercalation pseudocapacitive process by reducing the diffusion energy barrier, affording a high-rate capability and long cycle life.167 3D petal-like graphene-rich wrapped rutile TiO2 (G/P-rTiO2) exhibited a reversible capacity of 144.4 mA h g−1 after 1100 cycles at a current density of 2.5C and a capacity retention of 94.4% after 4000 cycles at 10C.168 A similar strategy was reported by Wang et al., who fabricated partially single-crystalline mesoporous Nb2O5 nanosheet-wrapped graphene. This composite exhibited a high reversible specific capacity and outstanding high-rate performance.169 For metal sulfides, Hu et al. used the intercalation reaction to modify FeS2 microspheres, together with selecting a compatible NaSO3CF3/diglyme electrolyte and tuning the cut-off voltage to 0.8 V. A stable electrically conductive layer-structured NaxFeS2 was formed and exhibited a surprisingly high-rate capability (170 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1) and unprecedented long-term cyclability (∼90% capacity retention for 20000 cycles). Equally, a low-cost, high-yield, and scalable two-step approach to obtain a new type of hybrid material containing MoS2/graphene nanosheets through ball-milling and exfoliation of commercial bulky MoS2 and graphite was reported by Sun et al.170 MoS2/graphene nanosheets exhibited remarkably high rate capabilities (284 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1 and 201 mA h g−1 at 50 A g−1) (Fig. 8).

Table 5 summarizes alloy- and conversion-type electrode materials with high rate behaviors. Regardless of whether metals or metal oxides, sulfides, phosphides, and selenides were used, these modifications were not only key for the high-rate capability of the electrode materials, but also efficiently addressed the issue of large volume variations during repeated cycling to improve the cycling lifespan (Fig. 9).

Section summary. 

Fig. 10a and b summarize the high-rate progress of NIB cathode and anodes, respectively. Clearly, NIBs have manifested remarkably high-rate capabilities, even without modifications. The barriers for Na are lower than those of Li in the transfer process due to the inherent advantage of the electrode materials. Furthermore, the methods and strategies used for material modification in LIBs can be applied to improve NIB electrodes, accelerating the obtainment of high-rate capabilities. Therefore, ultrahigh power NIBs can be achieved without compromising cost (Fig. 11).

4 Climate advantage of stationary NIBs
The reaction kinetics of electrode materials in most rechargeable batteries are temperature-dependent. Specifically, the environmental temperature plays a critical role in battery performance.182 Generally, battery performance improves as the working temperature increases. As NIBs use organic electrolytes, the working temperature must be controlled under the threshold value of the organic solvents to avoid fire risks or explosions. When operating under low-temperature conditions, the batteries suffer electrochemical decay. In particular, serious polarization of the battery reaction leads to the fast arrival of cut-off voltages and, eventually, battery failure, from which no capacity can be delivered or restored in the battery. To avoid such failure, ESSs in the form of rechargeable batteries must be paired with an additional temperature management system to enable stable energy storage and delivery. Traditionally, temperature-controlling accessories have been widely used to address the climate concerns of batteries. Wang et al. designed an internal self-heated nickel foil accessory for the cell, which exhibited a superior temperature management capability compared with traditional external temperature accessories. Notably, the internal heating system only consumed 3.8% of battery capacity to achieve fast warming of the battery system to 20 °C from a low-temperature environment (−20 °C).183,184 However, the additional accessories had negative effects on the energy density and the cost of stationary ESSs, which should be addressed before their wide application.
As an alternative, enhancing the environmental adaptability of batteries is the most cost-effective method for mitigating the influence of ambient temperature on battery performance. Therefore, in this section, the climate features of NIBs will be summarized for the first time. NIBs can operate over an extremely wide temperature range (from −30 to 55 °C) without using additional temperature control to maintain a proper working temperature.115 This all-climate feature of stationary NIBs is critical for ESSs, especially those without temperature-controlling accessories in remote areas. The strong adaptability of NIBs to various climatic environments also highlights their high reliability and safety.
4.1 All-climate electrode materials for stationary NIBs
An all-climate electrode requires materials that have stable phase structures at high temperatures and an electrolyte interface that can rapidly deliver sufficient charges without being impacted by temperature. Layered transition metal oxides have drawbacks of insufficient thermal stability at high temperatures. Much effort has been devoted toward introducing inactive elements, such as Li+, Mg2+, Al3+, and Mn4+, into the transition metal layers of layered oxides compounds to enhance their structural stability. Compared with layered transition metal oxides, phosphates compounds are more attractive in terms of maintaining their structural and thermal stability under extreme conditions. Therefore, most pioneering reports related to the all-climate electrochemical performance of NIB have focused on phosphate compounds. For example, Choi et al. investigated the thermal stability of the desodiated state of Na3V2(PO4)3 using TG/DSC and in situ XRD techniques, demonstrating that NaV2(PO4)3 maintained its structural stability up to 450 °C.58
Liu et al. found a class of NASICON-type electrode materials with all-climate performance. The NVP@C composite exhibited excellent electrochemical performance in the temperature range of −30 to 55 °C.115 Similarly, Wang et al. constructed a carbon-coated Na3Ti2(PO4)3 (NTP@C) composite that exhibited excellent all-climate electrochemical performance. Even at −25 °C, the NTP@C anode delivered a high specific capacity at a rate of 10C.117 Apart from phosphate compounds, several other advanced electrode materials also exhibited excellent electrochemical behavior at low temperature. Ponrouch et al. investigated the low temperature performances of hard carbon in NIBs, which delivered a high specific capacity of 265 mA h g−1 at −15 °C.185 You et al. prepared a robust and flexible Prussian blue (Na2Fe2(CN)6)-based composite electrode for NIBs.186 Benefiting from the fast ionic/electronic transport kinetics at low temperature, the electrode exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance at −25 °C.
Notably, most of the NIBs mentioned above were evaluated in half-cell configurations, in which the high impedance of sodium metal anodes at low temperatures was ignored. Generally, as the working temperature decreases, the diameter of semicircles in the high-to-medium frequency range of EIS plots of NIBs become significantly larger, suggesting an increase in internal impedance of the cell. Liu et al. demonstrated that such an increase was caused by counter sodium metal anodes in NIBs rather than the working electrode.115 The high impedance of the sodium metal electrode leads to the battery having a large overpotential during cycling, which narrows the actual charge/discharge voltage window of NVP@C and, finally, results in failure of the NVP@C cathode. Therefore, to evaluate the kinetic properties of electrode materials using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, symmetric cells consisting of identical working electrodes were better alternatives to the half-cell system, providing practical information about NIBs in frigid regions.
Using full-cell cases for low-temperature estimation can avoid the above concerns. Guo et al. assembled a full cell with Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathode and Na3Ti2(PO4)3 anode (NVPF–NTP).187 When the temperature decreased from 25 to −25 °C, the NVPF–NTP full cell delivered a specific capacity of 96.1 mA h g−1 with two evident plateaus/slopes, corresponding to a capacity retention of 76.4% compared with that at 25 °C. This implied that low-temperature kinetics of the NVPF–NTP electrode were superior. Wang et al. constructed an advanced NIB consisting of a 3D Se/graphene composite anode and a Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathode,188 which had a capacity retention of >75% after 1000 cycles at temperatures ranging from 25 to −25 °C at 0.4 A g−1. Post-spinel NaV1.25Ti0.75O4 anodes also exhibited an excellent wide-temperature rate capability.189 As suggested by Li et al., the NaV1.25Ti0.75O4 anode delivered discharging capacities of 93 and 100 mA h g−1, respectively, at −20 and 60 °C, while the variation in average voltages was negligible at different temperatures, indicating the great potential of NaV1.25Ti0.75O4 in all-climate NIBs.
4.2 All-climate electrolyte for stationary NIBs
Temperature significantly influences ion diffusion in the electrolyte and at the solid electrolyte interface. Ponrouch et al. provided important insights into searching for optimized electrolytes for NIBs. The authors benchmarked various electrolytes containing diverse solvent mixtures (including cyclic/acyclic carbonates and glymes) and Na-based salts with either F-based or perchlorate anions, and measured the viscosity, ionic conductivity, and thermal and electrochemical stability of the electrolytes.190 The binary ethylene carbonate (EC):propylene carbonate (PC) solvent mixture was the best solvent formulation and was used to evaluate the electrochemical performance of Na/hard carbon cells with both NaClO4 and NaPF6 salts. Notably, as PC has a vitreous transition temperature of about −95 °C, no electrolyte solidification can be observed when PC is used as co-solvent. This is essential for the low temperature application of NIBs because the liquid electrolyte behaves seemingly like an ionic-liquid-based electrolyte at very low temperatures (Fig. 12).

Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Furthermore, high temperatures also pose a threat to organic electrolytes.191 Ponrouch et al. conducted a systematic study on optimizing electrolyte formulations to decrease interfacial side reactions and the abuse tolerance of NIBs.190 The authors suggested that solid-state electrolytes have better mechanical properties, higher thermal stability, and wider electrochemical windows compared with nonaqueous organic electrolytes. Therefore, solid-state NIBs might be the ultimate choice for constructing battery systems with higher energy densities and safer characteristics.86

Section summary. 
Currently, the electrochemical performances of NIBs are mostly evaluated at constant temperatures in laboratories rather than in complex practical conditions. Bridging the gap between laboratory and practical conditions is of vital importance to enable the practical application of rechargeable batteries, including NIBs. In addition to the all-climate necessity, full-cell data for NIBs are also of vital importance to exhibit their application potential. These results from realistic situations useful for reference rather than for apparent performance comparison. Currently, phosphate compounds and modified layered transition metal oxides are both the primary choice as electrode materials for all-climate NIBs. Furthermore, electrolytes should be evaluated at different temperatures for no-matter liquid and solid state configurations.

5 Environmental advantages of stationary NIBs
ESS applications require vast numbers of cells. Therefore, large amounts of waste NIBs will be produced by ESS upgrades. These hazardous components pose be a significant threat to the environment if they are abandoned without further manipulation. Furthermore, waste NIBs contain enormous metallic resources and organic electrolytes that are valuable for recycling, known as so-called urban mines.192 In this respect, NIBs have significant advantages compared with LIBs. Al foils are used for both cathode and anode current collectors in NIBs, simplifying the battery components. In this section, we provide a comprehensive outlook on NIB recyclability and their major challenges.
5.1 Sharing experiences and technologies from LIBs
Linda Gaines, an analyst working for the Center for Transportation Research at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, has stated that “If you don’t think about recycling early, you could develop some battery chemistry that's going to be completely intractable”. This situation has occurred in LIB products and recycling.193 Lack of such foresight is unfortunate for the ecological environment, resulting in errors similar to the case of white plastics. Furthermore, battery manufacturers often prioritize performance and cost to increase market share without considering the design of battery recyclability.29 Fortunately, increasing attention is being paid to environmental issues associated with the disposal of waste batteries.192
Generally, recycling is an ideal solution to solve environmental problems induced by waste materials and alleviate shortages of critical materials through closed-loop recycling.194–196 Both LIBs and NIBs consist of cathodes, anodes, metallic current collectors, separators, electrolyte salts dissolved in organic solvents, and stainless steel sealing accessories. With reference to the recycling process of LIBs, NIB recycling can be anticipated as follows:197 abandoned batteries are first crushed into small pieces for further separation, followed by the collection of stainless steel accessories via magnetic separation and the separator through a flotation process. After thermal vacuum processing, organic solvents can be easily removed and collected from waste scraps. As suggested by Maschler et al., the recycling efficiency ratio of organic electrolytes can reach 80%.28 The above manipulations recycle half of the battery cost, as shown in Fig. 2. As NIBs have similar cell components and system, such as steel sealing accessories, organic electrolyte, and separator, these cumulative recycling technologies for LIBs can be applied to NIBs.
Remaining components in the waste scraps are the cathode slurry, anode slurry, and metallic current collectors. For current LIB components, these waste scraps are difficult to further separate and recycle using a simple method. Pyro- and hydro- metallurgical methods are widely adopted to recycle valuable metal resources.197,198 All waste scraps are smelted and refined by thermal treatment. Therefore, a high energy and emissions footprint accompanies pyro-metallurgical recovery. Furthermore, some metal materials with low value, such as aluminum, will end up in the waste stream after the recycling process, leading to a large amount of solid waste materials for the environment. Conversely, hydro-metallurgical recovery efficiently separates and collects valuable metal resources using massive amounts of chemical reagents. After separating aluminum and copper, filtrates including Li, Co, Ni, and Mn can be reused as precursors for the cathode in the co-precipitation method.199 However, the main concern is the high costs incurred by chemical reagents and post-wastewater treatment.200 Fortunately, the research and battery community has made great strides toward low-carbon and low-cost recovery without secondary environmental pollution. The combination of pyro- and hydro-metallurgical methods has achieved benefits in the recycling industry, driving policy and efforts in LIB recycling.201
Learning lessons from LIB experiences and technologies means that high-efficiency recycling processes for NIBs have a great chance of being achieved. Currently, the development of NIBs is in its infancy. Few research institutes and companies have the ability to mass-produce NIB packs. However, the recyclability of NIBs must be considered in terms of electrode materials and battery frameworks. Developing recyclable NIB technologies is the most cost-effective approach to avoiding the repeated metallurgical process.
5.2 Prescient recycling design of NIBs
Copper current collectors are replaced by Al foil in NIBs, because Al does not have an alloy reaction with Na, even at reduced potentials.45 This substitution simplifies the battery components, especially for the above waste scraps. Al foils can be easily dissolved by basic solutions and elemental Al can then be collected from the Al(OH)3 sediments. Therefore, the cathode, which is the most value component in NIBs, can be recycled and rejuvenated in a closed-loop cycle. Furthermore, the direct recovery of electrode materials can be readily achieved in the recycling process. The objective of direct recovery is to reduce energy, emissions, and waste, saving money on compliance with air-pollution regulations and disposal fees, compared with traditional pyro- and hydrometallurgical processes.192 Such direct recovery has been achieved for LIBs (Table 6).82–84,202,203

Furthermore, the replacement of Al by Cu as anode current collector also facilitates the establishment of a unique electrode framework, such as a bipolar electrode structure. Compared with a conventional battery configuration, bipolar battery configurations have advantages of a simple structure and high power. Such a bipolar electrode structure is enabled by the unified current collector for cathode and anode. In NIBs, Al foils are stable for the cathode and anode. Unlike traditional batteries, which consist of single cells connected in series, as shown in Fig. 13, bipolar batteries are highly stacked to produce a high voltage in a small volume. The construction of a bipolar battery does not require heavy intercell connectors. Massive battery accessories are no longer used. Therefore, the battery components are further simplified and more easily recycled. This recyclable feature of NIBs not only addresses the environmental concerns of waste batteries, but also enables large-scale applications of high-cost cathode materials (Fig. 14).

Section summary. 
NIBs have great potential for achieving full-battery recyclability. Prescient battery design is crucial for the recycling of heavily regulated disposal in NIBs. The recycling process of NIBs in the form of bipolar batteries is simple, allowing for the closed-loop cycling of key materials. As a result, some high-cost electrode materials, including those containing Co and Ni, can be recycled economically by one-step treatment.

6 Conclusions and perspectives
NIB research aims to satisfy the demand of large-scale ESS in applications of renewable energy and smart grids. As summarized in this review, NIBs have exhibited four attractive features. These features are generally based on novel host materials, rational electrolyte formulation, unique electrode architectures, and cell configurations. Compared with other chemical energy storage systems (such as LIBs, LABs, SCs, and LFBs), these NIBs are not the best in each performance indicator, but are the most suitable candidate for ESS applications. NIBs can be concluded to possess very good compatibility with ESS. Therefore, for the development of practically viable ESS, the future direction of NIBs research should further enhance these competitive features and explore new features in electrode materials.
Compared with Li ions, Na ions have a larger size and atomic weight, and suffer from slower ionic transport kinetics and a lower energy density. These disadvantages can be compensated by the high-rate ability of sodium-containing compounds. Traditionally, batteries and supercapacitors are complementary electrochemical energy storage technologies. Specifically, batteries have high energy densities, but low power densities, while supercapacitors offer high power density with low energy. NIBs currently belong to the batteries category, but have high performance behavior, which shows potential for extending beyond the limitations on energy and power density. Firstly, novel electrode materials and structure designs must be developed. Despite huge progress in NIB research made in recent years, fundamental difficulties in stable Na+ insertion/extraction have yet to be fully overcome in NIBs.
Furthermore, we propose a bipolar strategy for electrode materials in NIBs to reduce costs during recycling and enhance the benefits from waste batteries, making NIB recycling more economic. To achieve this goal, bipolar electrode materials are key. The combination of low potential redox TMs (Ti, V, Nb, and Mo) and high potential redox TMs (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ru) is a promising method for realizing bipolar electrode materials and, consequently, bipolar electrode structures. For example, in model polyanion compounds Nax[TMy,TM2−y′](PO4)3, the redox couple of one transition metal is nearly independent of another, which allows the design of a bipolar electrode structure. Furthermore, such a symmetrical battery structure based on a Nax[TMy,TM2−y′](PO4)3 electrode is also favored for high-efficiency recycling. Therefore, the rational modification of these bipolar electrode materials is key to enabling these competitive features of NIBs on an industrial scale for the energy storage market.204 Herein, we propose several feature-oriented solutions, as follows:
(i) Learning from current experience in advanced LIBs, cathode research should be directed towards high capacity and high voltage to enhance the energy density of NIBs. Na-rich layered metal oxides might be a candidate.
(ii) Reaction mechanisms of sodium insertion/extraction must be clearly elucidated using in situ or ex situ technologies to direct further research activities. This basic information is of vital importance for enhancing the rate capability.
(iii) Innovations in electrode architectures and cell configurations enhancing high rate capacity. The open 3D framework can provide sufficient interstitial spaces for ionic diffusion. The direct connect reduces the electric transfer pathway.
