    , Accepted 22nd July 2014First published on 4th August 2014AbstractSide chain engineering of an n-type polymer provides a means of maintaining solubility while increasing crystallinity and electron mobility, leading to enhanced photocurrent. Bulk heterojunction solar cells composed of a side chain engineered copolymer (PNDIS-30BO) as acceptor and PSEHTT as donor give 10.4 mA cm−2 photocurrent and 4.4% efficiency.
The use of electron-conducting (n-type) polymer semiconductors as the electron acceptor in polymer solar cells1,2 offers many potential advantages over fullerene acceptors.3 The facile tunability of various intrinsic properties of such n-type conjugated polymers, including optical absorption, electronic structure, crystallinity, solubility, and charge transport, exemplifies their attractive features. The greater thermal stability and mechanical strength of n-type conjugated polymers can ensure more morphologically and environmentally rugged all-polymer solar cells. Compared to the negligible visible and near infrared light harvesting by fullerene acceptors, n-type conjugated polymers can contribute to light absorption in the solar cell as much as the donor polymer; an important fundamental consequence of this is that photoinduced hole transfer becomes an important pathway for charge photogeneration as is photoinduced electron transfer.4 Unfortunately, the performance of all-polymer solar cells reported to date, is still far behind that of polymer/fullerene systems, with very few papers reporting a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 3%.2 A major limitation of the performance of reported all-polymer solar cells is the low photocurrent of the devices, and thus developing new n-type or p-type polymers that can enhance the photocurrent while maintaining the other photovoltaic properties is highly desirable.
Many reports have showed that alkyl, alkoxy, or other side chains on p-type conjugated polymers can have a large impact on the carrier mobility in thin film transistors5 and on the performance of polymer/fullerene solar cells.6 These effects of side chains can be due to size, density, topology (linear vs. branched), and in the case of multiple different side chains composition, and distribution (e.g. uniform, random, etc.). Although the mechanisms of how the side chains influence charge transport and photovoltaic properties of polymer/fullerene blend systems vary, they all relate to the polymer/fullerene blend film morphology:6,7 molecular packing of the polymer backbone which can be a “face-on” or “edge-on” orientation relative to the plane of the substrate; crystallinity of both polymer and fullerene; improved compatibility with the fullerene component and overall nanoscale morphology; and enabling or preventing intercalation of fullerene molecules into the polymer side chains. These ideas of side chain engineering of p-type conjugated polymers are yet to be similarly explored in n-type polymer semiconductors towards improving the performance of all-polymer solar cells.
In this paper, we report all-polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with 4.4% PCE and 10.4 mA cm−2 short circuit current density achieved by means of side chain engineering of the n-type polymer semiconductor component. The series of new n-type conjugated polymers, PNDIS-xBO (x = 10, 30, 50), are all composed of identical naphthalene diimide (NDI)-selenophene alternating copolymer backbone but have different composition and distribution of the alkyl side chains 2-decyltetradecyl (DT) and 2-butyloctyl (BO) as shown in Fig. 1a. X-ray diffraction analysis of PNDIS-xBO films shows that the crystallinity is increased with increasing amount x of the shorter BO side chains. The photovoltaic and charge transport properties of blends composed of PNDIS-xBO as acceptor and a thiazolothiazole–dithienosilole copolymer (PSEHTT)6d,8 as donor were investigated by inverted BHJ solar cells and by space charge limited current measurements, respectively. We found that the photocurrent, PCE, and carrier mobilities of the all-polymer solar cells progressively increased with the side chain composition variable x up to the 30 mol% BO optimum.

The n-type conjugated random copolymers, poly{([N,N′-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-selenophene)-ran-([N,N′-bis(2-butyloctyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-selenophene))} which are denoted as PNDIS-xBO, were synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization of three monomers (Fig. S1, ESI†): 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)selenophene, 4,9-dibromo-2,7-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)benzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8-tetraone (NDI-DT), and 4,9-dibromo 2,7-bis(2-butyloctyl) benzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8-tetraone (NDI-BO). PNDIS-xBO, where x is the molar percentage of NDI-BO monomer, of 3 different compositions (10, 30, and 50 mol%) were synthesized to control the alkyl side chain composition: PNDIS-10BO; PNDIS-30BO; and PNDIS-50BO. The reference naphthalene diimide (NDI)-selenophene alternating copolymer, which has a uniform 2-decyltetradecyl (DT) side chain composition, PNDIS, was also synthesized for the purpose of comparison. The other reference NDI-selenophene alternating copolymer with uniform BO side chain composition, PNDIS-BO, was also synthesized; However, this polymer was largely insoluble and thus was not further studied. The molecular structures of the monomers and copolymers were confirmed by 1H NMR (Fig. S2–S5, ESI†).2a PNDIS, PNDIS-10BO, PNDIS-30BO showed excellent solubility (>40 mg mL−1) in common organic solvents (chloroform, chlorobenzene) at room temperature whereas PNDIS-50BO (∼10 mg mL−1) showed very limited solubility. The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) against polystyrene standards in chlorobenzene at 60 °C. The Mn of PNDIS-xBOs slightly varied in the range of 41.7–48.8 kDa with a PDI of 1.1–1.7 (Table S1, ESI†). The reference PNDIS sample had a Mn of 36.8 kDa with a PDI of 1.2. All the polymers showed good thermal stability with an onset decomposition temperature (Td) of 384–403 °C under nitrogen flow.
The solid state morphology of PNDIS-xBO and PNDIS was analyzed by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) of drop-casted films. An intense lamellar crystalline (100) peak (2θ at 3.67–3.99°) and a π–π stacking peak (2θ at 21.52–22.64°) were observed in all the polymer films (Fig. S6 and Table S2, ESI†). The lamellar d-spacing for PNDIS, PNDIS-10BO, PNDIS-30BO, and PNDIS-50BO was 22.14, 23.46, 23.79, and 24.03 Å, respectively, and the π–π stacking distance was 4.12, 4.05, 3.99, 3.92 Å, respectively. This means that the lamellar d-spacing increased while the π–π stacking distance decreased as the fraction of BO side chains in the random copolymer increased. We understand this trend as a consequence of reduced steric hindrance between DT alkyl side chains that have a large effective molecular volume (∼706 Å3 per molecule), and thus increased planarity of the polymer backbone by adding BO alkyl chains with a smaller effective volume (∼285 Å3 per molecule).9 The mean size of the crystalline domains (L) of the polymers was calculated from the lamellar peaks using the Scherrer equation,7c,10L = Kλ/βcosθ, where K is shape factor (0.9), λ is X-ray wavelength (1.54 Å), and β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) in radian. The mean crystalline domain size L was found to be 8.4, 8.5, 8.8, and 13.3 nm for PNDIS, PNDIS-10BO, PNDIS-30BO, and PNDIS-50BO, respectively (Table S2, ESI†). This result shows that crystallinity is progressively increased by lowering the density of the longer DT side chains while increasing the amount of the shorter BO side chains in the random copolymers.
The electronic structures (LUMO/HOMO levels) and optical absorption of PNDIS-xBO and PNDIS were estimated from cyclic voltammograms (CVs) and UV-visible spectra of thin films. The LUMO energy level derived from the onset reduction potential in CVs (Fig. S7, ESI†) was −3.9 eV for all the polymers. The optical absorption spectra of PNDIS-xBO and PNDIS thin films (Fig. 1b) and in dilute chloroform solutions have the same peak positions with two distinctive absorption bands at 300–400 nm and 500–750 nm, which are due to π–π* transition and intramolecular charge transfer,1,11 respectively. Interestingly, PNDIS-xBO films have a higher absorption coefficient (α) of (2.7–2.9) × 104 cm−1 at their ICT band absorption maxima compared to PNDIS which has an α value of 2 × 104 cm−1. The higher absorption coefficients of PNDIS-xBOs can be understood from their increased crystallinity.
We investigated the photovoltaic properties of all-polymer BHJ solar cells made from PSEHTT:PNDIS-xBO and PSEHTT:PNDIS blends by using the inverted device structure: ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 1c), where the active layer is a PSEHTT:PNDIS-xBO or PSEHTT:PNDIS blend film with a composition of 1:1.5 wt/wt spin coated from a chlorobenzene solution. The solar cells were fabricated in a glovebox and tested under AM 1.5 solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2 in ambient air. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the BHJ solar cells composed of the side chain engineered n-type polymers (PNDIS-xBO) compared to the reference PNDIS are shown in Fig. S8a (ESI†) and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The reference PNDIS solar cells had a performance (Jsc = 6.55 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.76 V, FF = 0.52, and maximum PCE of 2.62%) that is comparable to our previous report.2a Compared to PNDIS devices, PNDIS-10BO solar cells have enhanced performance with slightly increased photocurrent (7.38 mA cm−2) and fill factor (0.55) while the Voc was unchanged. A significantly enhanced photocurrent of 9.13 mA cm−2 was observed in PNDIS-30BO devices, leading to a maximum PCE of 3.61%. However, the performance of PNDIS-50BO devices (Jsc = 7.21 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.74 V, FF = 0.51, PCE = 2.75%) did not show enhancement relative to PNDIS solar cells. The observed enhancement in photocurrent and overall performance of PNDIS-10BO and PNDIS-30BO devices compared to PNDIS cells is consistent with the reduced π-stacking distance in the acceptor polymers (PNDIS-xBO); we show later that reduction in π-stacking distance translates to increased electron mobility.9b,c,12 The absence of enhanced performance of PNDIS-50BO devices compared to either PNDIS or PNDIS-xBO (x = 10, 30) devices is likely a result of the poorer quality of its films, which originates from its poor solubility.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra shown in Fig. S8b (ESI†) correspond to the all-polymer BHJ solar cells whose J–V curves are in Fig. S8a (ESI†). The EQE spectra of these devices show that the photoresponse begins at ∼750 nm and covers the entire visible region, which demonstrates that the n-type polymers contribute to the light harvesting since the donor polymer PSEHTT does not absorb past 700 nm.6d,8 For all the devices, a maximum EQE of over 45% was observed and in the case of PNDIS-30BO cells, the EQE peaked at 56%. The photocurrent values calculated from the EQE spectra were found to be consistent with the Jsc values from J–V curves for all the devices, showing a mismatch between the two values of within 10%.
PNDIS-30BO devices were further optimized by surface modification of the electron-collecting ZnO electrode. It was recently reported that treatment of ZnO surface with 1 vol% ethanolamine in methoxyethanol reduced the work function of ZnO from 4.4 to 3.9 eV, resulting in improved performance of polymer/fullerene solar cells.13 The J–V curves and EQE spectrum of PSEHTT:PNDIS-30BO solar cells with similarly modified ZnO electrodes are shown in Fig. 2 and also summarized in Table 1. The performance of these all-polymer solar cells is significantly improved with a PCE of 4.44%, photocurrent of 10.37 mA cm−2, and Voc of 0.77 V.

The bulk charge transport properties of the all-polymer solar cells were investigated by space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements to explore the relationship of bulk transport to the photovoltaic properties. Electron mobility was measured in an ITO/ZnO/active layer/LiF/Al device structure whereas hole mobility was measured in an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au device structure. SCLC fittings to the current–voltage characteristics of the electron-only devices (ESI,† Fig. S9) and hole-only devices (ESI,† Fig. S10) produced carrier mobilities which are summarized in Table 1. Compared to the reference PSEHTT:PNDIS blend system, bulk electron and hole mobilities increased by factors of 2.2–2.5 to 6.5 × 10−5 and 2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, in the PSEHTT:PNDIS-30BO blend system. The SCLC carrier mobilities in the PNDIS-50BO blends were comparable or less than observed in the PNDIS devices. These bulk charge transport properties of the active layer blends are consistent with the observed photovoltaic properties of the all-polymer solar cells as well as with the increased crystallinity with increasing amount of BO side chains discussed earlier.
AFM imaging of the actual BHJ devices provided information on the surface morphology of the active layer blend in the all-polymer solar cells. AFM height and phase images with a scan area of 1 μm × 1 μm are shown in Fig. 3; larger area (5 μm × 5 μm) AFM images can be found in Fig. S13 (ESI†). PNDIS and PNDIS-10BO blend films showed identical surface morphology with similar domain sizes and roughness (2 nm). However, PNDIS-30BO blend film surface showed significantly reduced domain sizes, better interconnectivity, and small roughness of 1.2 nm, which can all be beneficial for efficient charge photogeneration and transport in solar cells due to limited exciton diffusion length.1f This favorable morphology of PNDIS-30BO blend film can partly account for the observed optimum photovoltaic performance of the devices. The highest roughness of 3.4 nm with higher domain size is observed in PNDIS-50BO blend films and this morphology could partly explain the poor performance of PNDIS-50BO blend solar cells.

In summary, we have demonstrated a side chain engineering strategy for the facile tuning of the composition and distribution of alkyl side chains on n-type conjugated polymers as a means of improving the photocurrent and performance of all-polymer solar cells. BHJ all-polymer solar cells with 4.4% PCE and 10.4 mA cm−2 photocurrent were achieved by using a resulting new acceptor polymer, PNDIS-30BO, composed of NDI-selenophene backbone and optimum 2-butyloctyl/2-decyltetradecyl composition. Observed large enhancement in photocurrent and efficiency of PNDIS-30BO solar cells compared to the reference PNDIS devices was explained by the increased crystallinity and electron mobility of PNDIS-30BO in conjunction with the optimum polymer–polymer blend morphology.
