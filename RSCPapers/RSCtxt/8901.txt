Introduction
Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted much attention from both scientific research and business communities, due to their merits of a low cost, light weight, mechanical flexibility, semi-transparency, etc.1–5 The core part of bulk heterojunction OSCs, viz. the active layer, consists of a blend of donor material and acceptor material, and the blend film forms a bicontinuous interpenetrating network to integrate exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport.6 Fullerene derivatives have dominated acceptor materials at the early stage and boosted power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs up to ∼11%.7,8 However, fullerene acceptors suffer from issues, such as weak absorbance in the visible region, inferior adjustability of energy levels and limited scope for synthetic control over structural properties, which limits the further improvement in PCEs of OSCs.9 This motivates scientists to develop high-performance non-fullerene acceptors.10 Nevertheless, it was valid for a long time that non-fullerene acceptors sustained low PCEs and their development lagged far behind fullerene materials, since it was difficult to balance the molecular stacking of the non-fullerene acceptor and its miscibility with the donor material, thus resulting in inferior mobility and/or poor morphology.11 In 2015, Zhan et al. subtly solved the issue via attaching side chains to the bridging-carbon atoms and hanging them out of the molecular plane, thus developing the fused-ring electron acceptor (FREA), ITIC, which promoted non-fullerene acceptors into the new era.12 The hanging side chains can not only endow FREAs with sufficient solubility for device processing, but also inhibit the excessive aggregation of FREAs to gain proper miscibility with the donor material for proper phase separation.11 Moreover, it can propel FREA molecules to undergo J-aggregation with end-to-end π–π stacking and maintain long-range ordering structure along the backbone direction in the blend film, thus benefitting charge carrier transport for high mobility.13,14 Therefore, side chains play a crucial role in the photovoltaic performance of FREAs. In recent years, a variety of strategies, such as optimizing side-chain length,15,16 adjusting side-chain structure,17–19 changing aryl chains to alkyl chains,20,21 and introducing highly dielectric chains,22,23 have been employed to finely regulate the miscibility, improve the crystallinity and facilitate exciton dissociation of FREAs, thus enhancing the PCEs of OSCs. However, the position of side chains on the molecular backbone, which would impact the electronic structure, molecular packing and the miscibility of FREAs, has been rarely investigated so far.17
In this work, we developed three undecacyclic donor cores with side chains attached to the bridging carbon at different positions and synthesized three isomeric FREAs, viz. IUIC-in, IUIC-mid and IUIC-out (Fig. 1a), to systematically investigate the effects of side-chain location on molecular properties as well as photovoltaic performance. Among them, coupled with the typical polymer donor PM6, the IUIC-mid based blend film exhibits the highest charge carrier mobilities and finest phase separation, with a clear nanofiber structure, due to the lowest trap density of states and modest miscibility. These contribute to the weakest charge carrier recombination and most efficient exciton dissociation in PM6:IUIC-mid based devices. Consequently, the PM6:IUIC-mid based OSC achieves the highest PCE of 13.1%, compared with PM6:IUIC-in and PM6:IUIC-out based OSCs.

Results and discussion
IUIC-in was prepared according to our previous report.24 The synthetic routes for IUIC-mid and IUIC-out are shown in Scheme S1 and the synthetic details are presented in the ESI.† It took four steps to synthesize IUIC-mid with a dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,7 diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) derivative as the starting material. We employed the classic synthetic strategy of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene to synthesize the key intermediate, compound 7 (see the ESI†), with ethyl dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene-3-carboxylate and then used a similar synthetic route for the preparation of IUIC-mid to prepare IUIC-out.25 The chemical structures of the intermediates and FREA isomers were confirmed by NMR (Fig. S1–S12, ESI†) and mass spectrometry, respectively. The solution and thin-film absorption spectra of IUIC-in, IUIC-mid and IUIC-out were determined by using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer and are shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†) and Fig. 1b. The absorption data are collected in Table S1 (ESI†). In solution, the maximum absorption peaks of IUIC-in, IUIC-mid and IUIC-out are located at 757 nm, 751 nm and 734 nm, respectively, which indicates that the absorption of FREAs show a blue-shift as hanging side chains move from the molecular centre to the end groups. From solution to thin-film states, the absorption of IUIC-in, IUIC-mid and IUIC-out all exhibit a remarkable red-shift, but sustain the same tendency as the solution state with maximum peaks at 795 nm, 790 nm and 779 nm, respectively. The optical bandgaps of IUIC-in, IUIC-mid and IUIC-out, estimated from the absorption onset of the thin films, are 1.36 eV, 1.37 eV and 1.44 eV, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry was employed to measure the oxidation/reduction potentials (Eonox/Eonred) of IUIC-in, IUIC-mid and IUIC-out. The Eonox/Eonred of IUIC-in, IUIC-mid and IUIC-out are 0.46 V/−0.88 V, 0.45 V/−0.90 V, and 0.48 V/−1.00 V, respectively (Fig. S14, ESI†). According to the empirical equation, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of IUIC-in, IUIC-mid and IUIC-out were calculated to be −5.26 eV, −5.25 eV and −5.28 eV, respectively, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of IUIC-in, IUIC-mid and IUIC-out were calculated to be −3.92 eV, −3.90 eV and −3.80 eV, respectively. The electrochemical bandgaps of IUIC-in, IUIC-mid and IUIC-out are 1.34 eV, 1.35 eV, 1.48 eV, respectively, which are consistent with their optical bandgaps. Therefore, the bandgaps of FREA isomers enlarge along with the side chains migrating from the molecular centre to the end groups.
To probe into the effect of the side-chain position on the miscibility of FREA isomers with the donor material, we chose the typical polymer, PM6, as the donor, and evaluated the Flory–Huggins interaction parameters (χ) between them.26 The contact angles of water and glycerol on PM6, IUIC-in, IUIC-mid and IUIC-out neat films were 99.6°/89.2°, 84.2°/75.8°, 90.1°/78.5°, and 88.0°/84.9°, respectively (Fig. 2). According to Wu's model, the surface free energy of PM6, IUIC-in, IUIC-mid and IUIC-out were calculated to be 21.63 mN m−1, 28.96 mN m−1, 27.20 mN m−1 and 25.45 mN m−1, respectively.27 According to the equation , the reduced surface-free-energy root difference between PM6 and FREA results in a smaller χ.28 The smaller the value of χ, the better the miscibility between the two materials. It indicates that the miscibility of FREAs with PM6 increases successively from IUIC-in, to IUIC-mid, to IUIC-out. According to the results above, it can be concluded that the position of hanging side chains has obvious impacts on the electronic structure of FREAs, as well as their miscibility with the donor material, as expected.

To investigate the influence of the side-chain position on the photovoltaic performance of FREA isomers, we used PM6 as the donor and fabricated OSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT: PSS/PM6:FREA/PDINN/Ag. The optimized J–V curves and corresponding photovoltaic parameters are presented in Fig. 3a, Table 1 and Tables S2–S10 (ESI†), respectively. The OSC based on PM6:IUIC-mid affords the best PCE of 13.1%, which is much higher than those based on PM6:IUIC-in (8.3%) and PM6:IUIC-out (7.4%). The VOC of the PM6:IUIC-out based device (0.99 V) is higher than those of devices based on PM6:IUIC-in (0.90 V) and PM6:IUIC-mid (0.87 V), due to the highest LUMO energy level of IUIC-out, while the superior PCE for the IUIC-mid based device is attributed to the higher JSC (21.4 mA cm−2) and FF (70.2%). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of IUIC-in, IUIC-mid and IUIC-out based OSCs are shown in Fig. 3b. It can be found that IUIC-mid based OSC exhibits a much higher EQE than IUIC-in and IUIC-out based OSCs in the broad region of 420–840 nm. The maximum EQE value of the IUIC-mid based device achieves 76% at 760 nm and is much higher than those of the IUIC-out based (53% at 760 nm) and IUIC-in based (51% at 640 nm) devices. The calculated integration currents, obtained from EQE spectra of PM6:IUIC-mid, PM6:IUIC-in, and PM6:IUIC-out based devices, are 21.2 mA cm−2, 14.5 mA cm−2 and 13.5 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the JSC values measured from J–V curves (<5% mismatch, Table 1).

To rationalize the difference in JSC and FF among PM6:IUIC-mid, PM6:IUIC-in and PM6:IUIC-out based OSCs, the charge carrier dynamics were investigated. To explore the exciton dissociation efficiency at the short-circuit condition (Pdiss = Jph/Jsat) in PM6:FREA based OSCs, we determined the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 4a).29Jph is denoted as Jph = JL–JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and dark, respectively. Veff is obtained by Veff = V0–Vappl, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Vappl is the applied bias voltage. Jsat represents the Jph under a high Veff (Veff = 2 V in this work), where all the photogenerated excitons are assumed to be dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by electrodes. The Jsat values of PM6:IUIC-in, PM6:IUIC-mid and PM6:IUIC-out based OSCs are 15.2 mA cm−2, 22.4 mA cm−2 and 16.2 mA cm−2, respectively. Thus, the Pdiss of the PM6:IUIC-mid based device was calculated to be 95.6% and slightly higher than those of PM6:IUIC-in (91.5%) and PM6:IUIC-out (87.4%) based devices, which indicates that PM6:IUIC-mid based OSC has the most efficient exciton dissociation. Bimolecular recombination in PM6:FREA based OSCs was studied by treating JSC as a function of incident light intensity, Plight.30 The data were fitted to the power-law equation: JSC ∝ Plightα (Fig. 4b). The α values of PM6:IUIC-in, PM6:IUIC-mid and PM6:IUIC-out based OSCs are 0.97, 0.98 and 0.96, respectively. This demonstrates that the bimolecular recombination in the PM6:IUIC-mid based OSC is slightly weaker than those in the PM6:IUIC-in and PM6:IUIC-out based OSCs. VOC as a function of Plight was further determined to investigate monomolecular recombination in OSCs. The VOC values of PM6:IUIC-in, PM6:IUIC-mid and PM6:IUIC-out based OSCs were plotted against lnPlight, respectively (Fig. 4c).31 The slopes for PM6:IUIC-in, PM6:IUIC-mid, and PM6:IUIC-out based OSCs are 1.26kT/q, 1.15kT/q and 1.24kT/q, respectively, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and q is the elementary charge. The smaller the slope, the lower the degree of monomolecular recombination in the device. According to the results above, the PM6:IUIC-mid based OSC exhibits the most efficient exciton dissociation and the weakest charge carrier recombination, thus affording the highest JSC and FF, compared to the PM6:IUIC-in and PM6:IUIC-out based OSCs.

To further explore the charge carrier transport properties in the PM6:FREA blend films, space-charge limited current (SCLC) method was employed to evaluate the hole and electron mobilities of the devices (Fig. S15, ESI†). The hole mobilities for PM6:IUIC-in, PM6:IUIC-mid and PM6:IUIC-out based devices are 2.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 12.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.80 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while the electron mobilities for PM6:IUIC-in, PM6:IUIC-mid and PM6:IUIC-out based devices are 5.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 19.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Table S11, ESI†). The highest mobilities for the PM6:IUIC-mid based device are conducive to charge carrier transport, thus inhibiting charge recombination in OSCs. Moreover, trap states in solar cells, resulting in the localization of charge carriers, have remarkable repercussion on charge transport.32,33 We further quantitatively measured the trap density in PM6:IUIC-in, PM6:IUIC-mid and PM6:IUIC-out based OSCs by using the SCLC method (Fig. 4d). The total trap density in the devices can be acquired according to the following formula:34  where VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, q is the elementary charge, nt is the total trap density, L is the active layer thickness, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, and ε is the relative dielectric constant. Thus, the total trap density for PM6:IUIC-in, PM6:IUIC-mid and PM6:IUIC-out based devices were calculated to be 8.29 × 1015 cm−3, 6.24 × 1015 cm−3, and 1.01 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. The lowest trap density for the PM6:IUIC-mid based device, probably due to the strong intermolecular interaction and fine morphology in the active layer, contributes to the weakest charge recombination and the highest charge carrier mobilities in OSCs.33
To study the phase separation in PM6:IUIC-in, PM6:IUIC-mid, and PM6:IUIC-out blend films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to measure the morphology of the active layer. As shown in the AFM height images (Fig. 5a–c), the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of PM6:IUIC-in, PM6:IUIC-mid, and PM6:IUIC-out blend films are 3.73 nm, 1.72 nm and 1.47 nm, respectively. The smaller RMS roughness for the PM6:IUIC-mid, and PM6:IUIC-out blend films facilitates charge carrier collection at the active layer/electrode interface.35 As shown in the phase images (Fig. 5d–f), PM6:IUIC-mid blend film exhibits the clearest phase separation with a long and fine nanofiber structure. It benefits exciton dissociation and charge transport, thus contributing to the highest Pdiss and weakest charge carrier recombination in the OSC. To further compare the details of phase construction in the blend films, line profiles across their phase images are shown in Fig. 5g–i and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peaks is used to estimate the nanofibril diameter. The calculated average FWHM values for PM6:IUIC-in, PM6:IUIC-mid and PM6:IUIC-out blend films decrease from 21.1 nm, to 17.9 nm to 15.8 nm, successively, which echoes the increased miscibility with PM6 from IUIC-in, IUIC-mid to IUIC-out. The exciton diffusion length for thin films of organic semiconductors is generally 10–20 nm. Thus, it can be concluded that IUIC-mid with side chains in the middle position has moderate miscibility with the donor PM6, probably due to the considerable end-to-end π–π stacking overlap for the appropriate intermolecular interaction with autologous molecules of IUIC-mid and PM6 molecules simultaneously, compared with IUIC-in and IUIC-out. This enables the PM6:IUIC-mid blend film to achieve the best morphology with a proper phase separation and long nanofiber structure to juggle exciton dissociation and charge transport well, thus helping to achieve the highest JSC and FF in OSCs.36 Therefore, it demonstrates that manipulating the side-chain position of FREAs is an efficient way to regulate intermolecular interaction in the blend film and thus improve the PCEs of OSCs.

Conclusions
In this work, we developed three isomers of FREAs, IUIC-in, IUIC-mid and IUIC-out, based on undecacyclic donor cores with hanging side chains at different positions. As side chains migrate from the molecular centre to end groups, the bandgaps and the miscibility with the donor PM6 of IUIC-in, IUIC-mid and IUIC-out increase gradually. The moderate miscibility enables the PM6:IUIC-mid blend film to possess the clearest phase separation with a fine nanofiber structure having a proper diameter of 17.9 nm, thus benefiting exciton dissociation and charge transport simultaneously. In addition, the lowest trap density for the PM6:IUIC-mid based device endows it with the highest charge carrier mobilities (1.22 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the hole and 1.91 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the electron, respectively) and, thus, contributes to optimal charge transport for inhibited charge carrier recombination in the OSC. As a result, the PM6:IUIC-mid based OSC achieves the best PCE of 13.1%, with a higher JSC and FF, compared with PM6:IUIC-in (8.3%) and PM6:IUIC-out (7.4%) based OSCs. This demonstrates that the position of side chains has a significant impact on the photoelectrical properties of FREAs, which should be taken into consideration carefully during the development of high-efficiency FREAs.
