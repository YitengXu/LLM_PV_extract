Few studies have focused on the application of high-fluorescence NaYbF4:Ho3+ upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) in solar cells. In this study, NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs were successfully prepared using a solvothermal method. We incorporated the NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs into ZrO2 as the scaffold layer for FA0.4MA0.6PbI3 perovskite solar cells. This design enabled the dual-functional effects, that is, the harvesting of NIR light and its conversion to visible light and the reduction of the electron–hole recombination rate. The effect of different amounts of NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs on the device performance was investigated in detail. The best-performance devices based on optimized addition of UCNPs (40 wt%) could achieve a power conversion efficiency as high as 14.32%, an increase of 28.8% compared with conventional ZrO2 nanoparticle-based PSCs (11.12%). The design of the synergetic operation of UCNPs and ZrO2 in the mesoporous structure of PSCs enhanced the photocurrent and photovoltage. The results offered the flexibility for the device architecture and broaden the solar spectral use of UCNP-based devices.
Introduction
The organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most promising third-generation photovoltaic technologies because of their unique properties, such as large absorption coefficient,1 ambipolar charge transport,2 long electron–hole diffusion lengths,3,4 and facile solution processability.5–7 The efficiency of PSCs has increased from 3.8% to 23.2%.8–13 To date, several factors, such as architecture, deposition process, and compositional manipulation, have been explored and altered to fabricate efficient PSCs.14–20
The standard spectrum of AM1.5G sunlight ranges from 280 nm to 2500 nm (i.e., 0.5–4.4 eV). However, only a small fraction of incident photons in the UV and visible ranges (280 nm–800 nm) can be absorbed and converted into electricity in PSCs.21 A large portion of the incident light is lost in the form of thermalization and non-absorbed photons. An interesting approach for PCE enhancement is the utilization of the upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) that absorb infrared (IR) or near infrared (NIR) light (with energy below the band gap of the semiconductor). IR or NIR is converted to visible light energy photons (with energy higher than the semiconductor band gap) through a non-linear process.22 Consequently, the photoresponse of the device could be extended to the sub-band gap photons.23 Theoretical calculations have predicted that the PCE of a typical silicon solar cell (Eg = 1.1 eV) can be increased from 20% to 25% by placing a rear UCNP layer under concentrated solar power.24,25 Given the large absorption cross-section of Yb3+ in the NIR region (980 nm) and efficient energy transportation from Yb3+ to the activators, Er3+, Tm3+, Ho3+,26 or NaYF4 nanoparticles (as the activator) are typically co-doped with Yb3+ (as the sensitizer). The resulting material is considered an efficient and stable upconversion (UC) material. Yb3+ and Er3+ co-doped β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+, β-NaYF4:Yb3+, and Tm3+/NaYF4 core–shell nanostructures are added to the mesoscopic structure of PSCs. The exploitation of the NIR incident solar photons mainly generated higher Jsc that led to higher PCEs (enhancements of the order of 15%–20%) compared with those of the UCNP-free reference devices. He et al.27 proposed a viable strategy for using judiciously synthesized monodisperse hexagonal phase (β-phase) NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ UCNPs as the mesoporous electrode [instead of mesoporous-TiO2 (mp-TiO2)] for PSCs, in which the PCE increased from 10.5% to 14.2%. Roh et al.28 proposed the use of UC materials, such as hexagonal Yb3+ and Er3+ co-doped β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ hexagonal nanoprisms. The introduction of UCNPs into the mp-TiO2 will convert the incident NIR radiation to visible light. Thus, the utilization of UCNPs in PSCs can effectively extend the photoresponse of the devices to IR or NIR. However, UCNPs have not been added into the insulation layer of ZrO2. ZrO2 has a larger band gap and markedly higher energy level in the conduction band, higher than the perovskite conduction band. Moreover, ZrO2 prevents the contact between TiO2 and the carbon counter electrode (CE), which results in high photovoltage.29 In addition, NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNP is a high-fluorescence UC luminescent material compared with NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+, which is widely used in lasers30 and bioimaging.31 We added NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs into ZrO2, and this process broadened the absorption scope of the PSCs and enhanced the photovoltage without affecting the carrier transport.
Herein, we report a novel upconverting scaffold layer with mixed ZrO2 nanoparticles and hexagonal NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs for a mesoporous structure of FTO/compact TiO2(cp-TiO2)/mp-TiO2/mp-ZrO2/FA0.4MA0.6PbI3/CE (Fig. 1). We found that the NaYbF4:Ho3+ material can convert the low-energy NIR photons into absorbable high-energy visible photons. ZrO2 thin films with different amounts of UCNPs were directly assembled, and their photovoltaic performances were compared. The short circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and carrier mobility were enhanced. The enhanced transformation and extraction of electrons suppressed the recombination loss, and the champion PCE of the optimized PSC was increased from 11.12% (ref. 48) to 14.32%.

Experimental section
NaYbF4:Ho3+ synthesis
Lanthanide oxides (3.3 mmol Yb2O3 and 0.065 mmol Ho2O3) were dissolved using HNO3 at an elevated temperature. The excess HNO3 was evaporated, and 3 mL of ethylene glycol was added to make a solution for future use. Then, 0.017 mol NaF was dissolved in 20 mL of ethylene glycol, and the prepared lanthanide nitrate solution was added slowly while stirring. Afterward, NH3·H2O (20%) was used to adjust the pH value to approximately 4–5, and the solution was continuously stirred for approximately 12 h at room temperature (RT), transferred into a polytetrafluoroethylene autoclave (50 mL capacity), and maintained at 180 °C for various time periods from 5–24 h. After natural cooling, the white precipitate was centrifuged and washed with water several times until the pH value was close to 7. The obtained product was dried at 100 °C.
Device fabrication
We used the architecture of FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/mp-ZrO2 (0–50 wt% UCNPs)/FA0.4MA0.6PbI3/C (Fig. 1a). FTO glass was cleaned by sequentially washing with detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone, ethanol (AR, anhydrous, 99.7%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd), and isopropanol (IPA). Before use, the FTO was cleaned by UVO for 25 min, and the ultrathin compact layer of TiO2 was deposited onto the FTO substrate by magnetron sputtering and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min in a furnace under ambient air. Then, a mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited by spin coating for 30 s at 3000 rpm using a particle paste (Dyesol 18NR-T, 4 wt%) diluted in ethanol to achieve a 200 nm thick mesoporous layer. After spin coating, the substrates were immediately dried at 100 °C for 10 min and sintered again at 500 °C for 30 min under a dry air flow. Then, 4 wt% of ZrO2:UCNPs were prepared by mixing ZrO2 paste with different amounts of UCNPs (0 wt%, 25 wt%, 30 wt%, 35 wt%, 40 wt%, and 45 wt% solvent DEE (300 μL) and added dropwise onto the substrate during spin-coating at 20 s before the end of the procedure. Then, the films were left on the bench to dry for 10–15 min and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The as-annealed samples were exposed to ambient conditions with a relative humidity (RH) of 50%–65%, the CE was fabricated by the printing process. After drying at 100 °C for 30 min, the mesoscopic PSCs were obtained.
Film characterization
Absorbance was recorded using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV 3600, Shimadzu). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs were obtained by using a Bruker-AXS D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer. The incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the PSCs was measured with a 300 W xenon lamp (Newport 66984). The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were evaluated under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2 irradiance) by using a solar simulator (Oriel, model 91192-1000) and a source meter (Keithley 2400, USA). The top views of the perovskite films were imaged by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Jeol JEM 6510LV). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on an electrochemical workstation (Zennium, IM6, Germany) over the frequency range of 100 mHz–1 MHz with a 10 mV AC amplitude at −0.9 V bias under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2 irradiance), the spectra were fitted using Z-view software. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) experiments were performed using a FLSP920 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd), and time-resolved (TR-PL) decay transients were measured viaa FLS 980E fluorometer. The PL spectra were measured with a fluorescence spectrometer (RF-6000, Shimadzu, Japan) using 980 nm laser as the excitation light source. The device performances were measured under ambient conditions (15% < RH < 60%) every time (winter, summer). After measurements, the devices were stored in a humidity-controlled dry room (15% < RH < 40%).
Results and discussion
We explored the suitable amount of NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs to be added to the ZrO2 scaffold layer to optimize cell efficiency. We used a solvothermal method to synthesize the upconverting luminescence materials. First, the as-prepared NaYbF4:Ho3+ precursor solution was placed on the reaction instrument for varying periods of time (from 5 h to 24 h) to investigate the effects of the different reaction times on the morphology using the result of crystallinity. The SEM images of NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs synthesized at 150 °C are presented in Fig. 2. A flake-like morphology and a rough surface were observed with highly heterogeneous gain sizes at 5, 10, and 15 h reaction times. Further increase in the reaction time to 20 and 24 h resulted in a uniform grain size and grains with better sphericity. The average size was 70–100 nm, which is very close to the size of ZrO2. Thus, the reaction time plays an important role in controlling the size and morphology of the NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs.

XRD measurements further showed the formation of hexagonal NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs crystals (Fig. 3). NaYbF4 existed either in the cubic α-phase (metastable high temperature phase) or the hexagonal β-phase (thermodynamically stable low-temperature phase) at ambient pressure. In most cases, the cubic α-phase NaYbF4 can be obtained under mild conditions. By contrast, the hexagonal β-phase NaYbF4 can be obtained from the α-phase via a cubic-to-hexagonal phase transition process under relatively severe conditions, such as long reaction time and high temperature.32 When the reaction time was increased to 15 h, the peaks belonging to the hexagonal β-phase were all significantly enhanced, whereas those corresponding to the cubic α-phase were weakened. When the reaction time was increased to 20 and 24 h, all other diffraction peaks could be readily indexed to the hexagonal-phase NaYbF4 crystals (JCPDS 27-1427). The hexagonal-phase (β-phase) NaYbF4 was more favorable for UC applications because of its high UC quantum yield than its cubic-phase (α-phase) counterpart.33

The reaction time also had a noticeable impact on the UC fluorescence of the NPs. Fig. 4(a) displays the UC fluorescence spectra of NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs under different reaction times (5–24 h) with excitation by a 980 nm NIR laser. The UCNPs synthesized at 150 °C for 5 h showed nearly no fluorescence, but the fluorescence intensity increased when the reaction time was extended to 10 and 15 h. Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity enhanced significantly when the reaction time was prolonged to 20 h. Fig. 4b illustrates that the upconversion transition of the UCNPs was basically a nonlinear anti-Stokes optical process,29,34 involving the excitation of Yb3+ under NIR light, the energy transfer from Yb3+ to Ho3+, and the radiative energy decay of Ho3+. Consequently, three emission peaks at 540, 644, and 750 nm were observed, which were assigned to 5S2, 5F4 → 5I8 (540 nm),5F5 → 5I8 (644 nm), and 5S2, 5F4 → 5I7 (750 nm) transitions, respectively (Fig. 4b).35 Notably, the 5S2, 5F4 → 5I8 (540 nm) transition, which was a dominant peak in the emission spectrum of NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs, corresponded to the bright green fluorescence under 980 nm excitation (Fig. 4a). This result suggested that the NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs facilitate NIR light absorption.

The NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs (reaction time of 20 h) were added into ZrO2 to act as scaffold layers for the PSCs [Fig. 5(a)]. The FA0.4MA0.6PbI3 perovskite layer was then deposited by a one-step spin coating method [Fig. 5(c)].53 Comparison of the SEM image of the ZrO2:UCNP film [Fig. 5(a)] with a conventional film constituted by the ZrO2 film [Fig. 5(b)] produced from a commercial paste showed a remarkable difference in the morphologies of the two layers. The ZrO2:UCNP film had a uniform surface, and the inter-nanoparticle spacing of the ZrO2 scaffold film could be readily tuned by adding a small amount of NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs into the nanoparticle solution. This led to a decreased number of holes in the scaffold film. The filling of the bumpy surface on the last layer could affect the film formation of the next layer. This phenomenon indicated that NaYbF4:Ho3+ doping may have a positive effect on the crystallization of ZrO2. Accordingly, the perovskite film [Fig. 5(c)] deposited on the ZrO2:UCNP layers was almost pinhole-free with better crystals and fewer grain boundaries than the perovskite films deposited on the pristine ZrO2 film [Fig. 5(d)]. The higher crystallinity [Fig. 7(a)] and better quality of the perovskite film deposited on the ZrO2:UCNP film were mainly ascribed to the homogeneity of the NaYbF4:Ho3+-doped ZrO2 film. Given that the grain boundaries and trap states are considered to be the major recombination sites in the perovskite films,37,38 the enlarged grains would effectively reduce the surface and bulk defect density and extend the charge-carrier lifetimes.39 The pinholes in the perovskite film deposited on the pristine ZrO2 film tended to serve as the current shunting pathways and induce detrimental current leakage. This process resulted in decreased Jsc and Voc. Fig. 5(e) shows the cross-sectional SEM image of FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/mp-ZrO2 (40 wt% UCNPs). Furthermore, we selected a region to perform compositional analysis via mapping-scan analysis. The results indicated that the Yb and Ho elements existed on the whole cross-section of the ZrO2 film [Fig. 5(f)–(h)].

Fig. 6(a) shows the Tauc curves of mesoporous ZrO2 with and without NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs. We calculated the band gap of ZrO2 and ZrO2:UCNPs (40 wt%) by plotting the diagram of (αhν)2 against hν obtained from the UV-vis absorption spectra.36 The curve clearly shows that the ZrO2 film exhibited a slightly narrower band gap after NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNP doping. The band gap energy (Eg) values were determined to be 3.46 and 3.37 eV for ZrO2 and ZrO2:UCNPs (40 wt%), respectively. The conduction band difference between ZrO2:UCNPs (40 wt%) and FA0.4MA0.6PbI3 was larger than that between undoped ZrO2 and FA0.4MA0.6PbI3 because of its narrow energy band gap, which could be one of the reasons it presents a higher open circuit voltage for solar cells based on ZrO2:UCNPs (40 wt%). Fig. 6(b) shows the absorption spectra of the ZrO2:UCNPs (40 wt%) film and ZrO2:UCNPs (40 wt%) along with the FA0.4MA0.6PbI3 perovskite film. The incorporated UCNPs are predicted to harvest photons in the NIR. As expected, the absorption spectra of the thin composite films are a combination of the absorption features from the perovskite and the UCNPs. Fig. 6(b) displays significant absorption in the NIR light absorption.

To investigate the crystallinity characteristics of the perovskite film, we performed XRD measurements as shown in Fig. 7(a). The results showed that the XRD spectra of the perovskite films exhibited identical characteristic diffraction, indicating that the additional UCNPs did not affect the crystallization of perovskite inside. The XRD spectra of the mixed perovskite films exhibited strong diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 28.4° and 31.8° and minor peaks at 20° and 24.4°. With the increase of the amount of UCNPs, the crystallinity of the two main peaks of perovskite also increased. The effect of different amounts of the ZrO2:UCNP scaffold film on the photovoltaic performance of FA0.4MA0.6PbI3 PSCs was further scrutinized to optimize the device efficiency. Fig. 7(b) shows a comparison of the J–V characteristics of FA0.4MA0.6PbI3 PSCs with UCNPs (0 wt%–50 wt%) in ZrO2. PSCs with varying weight percentages of UCNPs exhibited an improvement in the photocurrent and photovoltage relative to the bare ZrO2. The optimized amount of UCNPs was found to be 40 wt%, which led to a Voc of 0.975 V, Jsc of 25.16 mA cm−2, FF of 58.7%, and a high PCE of 14.32%. A further increase in the concentration from 40 wt% to 50 wt% reduced the Jsc, Voc, and PCE. A decrease of ∼2.3% in the Jsc was observed compared with 40 wt% (Jsc = 25.16 mA cm−2) probably because of the decreased Rrec correlated with the agglomeration nature of NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs (Table 2). Fig. 7 shows that the PSC-UCNP devices had a higher PCE primarily because of the incorporation of UCNPs. UCNPs provided a promising route to reduce the non-absorption photon loss in organic–inorganic halide PSCs. In these PSCs, the incident photons with energy lower than the band gap of perovskites (e.g., NIR light) were absorbed by the UCNPs, converted to high-energy photons, and contributed to the photocurrents of perovskite active layers.

The PL quenching experiment and TR-PL were used to study the charge transfer kinetics between the perovskite and different scaffold layers.40 The carrier extraction behavior of different UCNP concentrations was studied. Fig. 8a displays more efficient PL quenching with the perovskite film grown on the ZrO2 film (40 wt%) than the perovskite film grown on the ZrO2 film (0 wt%, 35 wt%, and 45 wt%). PL quenching was due to the enhancement in the charge carrier extraction across the interface between ZrO2 and the perovskite layer. As expected, the improved interfacial contact and enhanced conductivity could contribute to the improved injection and transportation of electrons and reduced charge accumulation [Fig. 5(a)].41,42 The charge transport behavior of devices with UCNPs was further investigated by using the TR-PL spectra [Fig. 8(b)]. The PL decay time of the perovskite films can be fitted by a bi-exponential decay function, corresponding to a slow decay process from the radiative decay and a fast decay process in the perovskite materials.43 All parameters are listed in Table 2. For the ZrO2:UCNP (0 wt%)/perovskite sample, τ1 was 137.40 ns (78.40%), and τ2 was 60.38 ns (21.60%), resulting in an amplitude τave of 107.73 ns. By contrast, for the ZrO2:UCNP (40 wt%)/perovskite sample, τ1 was 100.93 ns (60.59%), and τ2 was 42.70 ns (39.41%), with an amplitude average lifetime of 65.65 ns. Therefore, the photon-induced electrons transfer from ZrO2:UCNPs (40 wt%)/perovskite to the electronic selection layer (ESL) was faster and more effective than that from the ZrO2/perovskite to the ESL. This characteristic is beneficial for the effective charge separation and the suppression of charge recombination at the ZrO2/perovskite interface, resulting in higher Jsc and Voc. A further increase in the concentration from 40 wt% to 45 wt% led to a reduction in τ1 and τ2. Moreover, the UCNP content in the ZrO2 layer influenced the absorption spectrum [Fig. 8(c)]. A new response from 950 to 1000 nm appears with the attachment of UCNPs, which provides proof that the upconversion works in the PSC in the NIR. The existence of the below-bandgap absorption in perovskite materials caused an asymmetric PL tail to extend toward longer wavelengths, and a red-shift in the PL spectrum was observed when the PL at short wavelength was inhibited. In our case, the red-shift of the PL spectra could be attributed to the reduction in the direct transition-related PL intensity induced by the interfacial carrier injection. This phenomenon was confirmed by the largest red-shift of PL for the 40% dopant.44,45

EIS analysis was performed to investigate the internal resistance to provide an insight into the interfacial dynamics of the charge transportation and recombination process in the PSCs. Based on the previous report,29 two RC elements represent the charge transfer resistance and recombination at the perovskite/CE and TiO2/perovskite interfaces in our electron impedance spectra. Fig. 8(d) shows the Nyquist plots of the devices based on the ZrO2:UCNPs (0 wt%–45 wt%), and the equivalent model is shown in the inset of Fig. 8d. The ZrO2:UCNPs (35 wt%–45 wt%) possess comparable Rs and Rtr at high frequency at the perovskite/CE interface. These parameters were smaller than those of PSCs composed of ZrO2 (0 wt%). The lower interfacial resistance could result in faster interfacial electron transfer, which is beneficial for the photoelectric conversion efficiency. However, the slightly higher Rrec for the ZrO2:UCNP (40 wt%) scaffold layer may be ascribed to the existence of fewer surface trap states in the insulating ZrO2:UCNPs (40 wt%) than in the ZrO2:UCNP (0 wt%, 35 wt%, 45 wt%).46 This result indicates less recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interface, corresponding to the differences in Voc and Jsc in Table 1.
Compared with the ZrO2 scaffold film-based device, the incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of a PSC incorporating UCNPs of more than 80% over a broad range of 400–600 nm suggested a better light harvesting and a lower charge recombination [Fig. 9(a)]. The characteristic of low charge recombination in the ZrO2:UCNP (40 wt%) scaffold film based device was consistent with the EIS result. Herein, a small response peaking was observed at approximately 970 nm corresponding to the UCNPs (40 wt%). Such responses in the IPCE spectra corresponding to UC effects have been reported in previous studies,47,49 Chang et al.47 reported that IPCE values can reach as high as 15% (∼980 nm). In our cases, we note that the Jsc of 22 mA cm−2 obtained from the integration of the IPCE profile was very close to the measured value of 25.16 mA cm−2. The stability remains a critical barrier for the practical application of the PSCs.49

Herein, the stabilities of the best-performing pristine ZrO2-based and ZrO2:UCNP (40 wt%)-based devices were tested. Both cells were exposed under dry air with a humidity of ∼35% without encapsulation, and the corresponding changes of the performance parameters are depicted in Fig. 9(b). The results showed that both devices exhibited an improvement in all performance parameters in the first several days. These characteristics may be ascribed to the stress release50 and light soaking effect.51 For both devices, a moderate decrease was observed slowly with time and finally became stable for our carbon-based devices. This result is consistent with the findings by Liu et al.52 on carbon-based devices.
In addition, the devices based on ZrO2:UCNPs (40 wt%) displayed the reproducibility of the device performance, and the PCEs were mainly in the range of 13.5%–14% (Fig. 10 and Table 3).

Conclusions
Hexagonal NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs were successfully fabricated using a simple solvothermal method. We demonstrated a novel design of synergetic operation of UCNPs and ZrO2 in the mesoporous structure, which improved the device performance of the PSCs by converting NIR sunlight to visible light. By optimizing the amount of NaYbF4:Ho3+ UCNPs in the ZrO2 scaffold layer, the ZrO2:UCNP (40 wt%)-based device resulted in a PCE as high as 14.32% (Jsc = 25.16 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.975 V, and FF = 58.7%) and an overall enhancement of 28.8%, compared with that of a ZrO2-based PSC device. Hence, the enhanced PSC performance could be attributed to three factors as follows: the generation of additional photocurrent and photovoltage via NIR photon UCNPs of NaYbF4:Ho3+; lower recombination rate and trap-state density; and faster charge transfer and extraction. The introduction of NIR harvesting nanomaterials provided possibilities for the promotion of broad light absorption for high-performance PSCs.
