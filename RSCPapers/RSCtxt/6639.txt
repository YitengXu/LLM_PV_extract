Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2013, 15, 17798-17803Dual-functional hetero-structured TiO2 nanotrees composed of rutile trunks and anatase branches for improved performance of quantum dot-sensitized solar cells†Feng Zhu, Hui Dong, Yi Wang, Dapeng Wu, Jianming Li, Jinlong Pan, Qi Li, Xicheng Ai, Jianping Zhang and Dongsheng Xu*Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, State Key Laboratory for Structural Chemistry of Unstable and Stable Species, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University, Beijing 100871, People's Republic of China. E-mail: dsxu@pku.edu.cnReceived 31st July 2013, Accepted 29th August 2013First published on 30th August 2013AbstractWe developed a two-step hydrothermal method to prepare hetero-structured TiO2 nanotree arrays on FTO substrates. This process included the deposition of rutile nanorod arrays with a length of about 2 μm as trunks at first and then the growth of the anatase nanosheets with the thickness of less than 10 nm standing on the rutile trunks through a dissolution-growth process. After being coated with CdS and CdSe quantum dots, these nanotrees were used as photoanodes in the quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). It was found that the branches could enlarge the surface area of the anode, increase the amount of the deposited quantum dots, and thus improve the light absorption of the whole device. Moreover, the electron transport dynamics indicated that the phase junctions between the rutile trunks and anatase nanosheets could accelerate the electron transport in the QDSSCs. As a result, we got a conversion efficiency of ∼2.4% with the thickness of less than 2 μm, which was 50% higher than that in the nanorod array-based QDSSCs.IntroductionThe performance of devices depends on the phases, the exposed facets and the morphologies of the materials.1–9 Hierarchical structures combining the advantages of both nanosized building blocks and micro- or submicrosized assemblies are considered as the best choice to promote materials' performances, which have been widely applied in the fields of solar cells, photocatalysis, lithium ion batteries and so on.10–15 For example, in photovoltaic devices, hierarchical structures show several advantages including large surface area, light scattering effect and dual-sized pore structure.16 The branching hierarchical arrays not only have the advantages mentioned above, but also contain the features of quasi-1D arrays because the trunks in them could act as highways for electron transport. The trunks have less grain boundaries and defects, guiding the electrons to diffuse directly to the substrate and decreasing the diffusion distance in other directions.17 The branching nanowires of silicon or III–V/II–VI semiconductors have been proved to be able to improve performances of the photovoltaic devices.18,19As the most important photoanode material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures have gained great attention.16 Recently, the branching rutile arrays and hierarchical anatase nanowire arrays have been synthesized and applied in DSSCs.20–25 The conversion efficiency has been improved due to the enlarged surface area for dye adsorption. However, compared to the spherical hierarchical structures, the reports on the branching arrays are still very rare. Since the materials of different phases with different energy band structures could guide the carrier transport, they were considered to be able to promote the charge separation and restrict the electron recombination, which has been used in photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical devices.26–28 The restricted recombination and accelerated transport processes are beneficial for solar energy conversion, so it is feasible to introduce the phase junctions into the solar cell devices. In this paper, we combined the strategies of branching structure and phase junctions, building the hetero-structured TiO2 nanotree (HNT) arrays composed of rutile trunks and anatase branches, which have not been reported to the best of our knowledge. Besides, they were employed in quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), which have attracted much attention due to the versatile properties such as tuneable band gap and multiple-exciton effect. The electron transport and recombination dynamics in QDSSCs have also been studied for further understanding of the QDSSC performance.Results and discussionHNT arrays on the FTO substrate were synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal growth process, as shown in Scheme 1. Firstly, the rutile nanorods (NR) array was grown on the FTO glass by the wet chemical method referring to the previous report.29 Afterwards, heat treatment at 450 °C was employed to improve the connection between the NRs and the substrate. Then the second step involving hydrothermal reaction of the rutile NR array/FTO was performed in the NaOH solution containing H2O2, which resulted in nanotree structure consisting of Na+–titanate nanosheets on the surface of NRs. The formation of the titanate was confirmed by the Raman spectrum – the intensity between 260 and 300 cm−1 increased after the second hydrothermal treatment (Fig. 1).30 After the H+ exchange and annealing process, the titanate nanosheets changed into anatase without morphology change. The component of the HNT arrays was also confirmed by the Raman result, in which the 145 and 516 cm−1 peaks correspond to the anatase.31 XRD patterns are given in ESI,† however, the anatase phase could not be detected from the XRD patterns, probably because the amount of sheets is low and the thickness is thin. Scheme 1  The procedure for the synthesis step of HNTs.  Fig. 1  The Raman spectra of (a) the rutile NRs, (b) the product of the hydrothermal reaction in the NaOH–H2O2 solution and (c) the rutile/anatase HNTs (Δ-titanate, ∇-anatase). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2(a), (c), and (e) show the SEM images of rutile NR array at different magnifications. The diameter and length of the NRs are 100–200 nm and ∼2 μm, respectively. After the second-step hydrothermal process, the NRs are hard to observe from the top view, and the tetragonal morphology appears over the surface (Fig. 2(b) and (d)). From the cross-sectional image (Fig. 2(f)), we can find the anatase sheets standing on the surface of the rutile NRs. The diameter of rutile NRs undergoes a reduction, especially on the top of the NRs. The length of HNTs also decreased to ∼1.7 μm. Fig. 2  Top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of (a, c, e) the rutile NR array and (b, d, f) the rutile–anatase HNT array. Further structural characterization of the rutile NRs and HNTs is performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 3(a), (b) and (c) show the typical TEM images of rutile NR and the corresponding FFT pattern, which agree with the SEM observation, showing that the NR is single crystalline across its entire length and grows along the [001] direction. The inter-planar space of d = 0.25 nm is in agreement with the d-spacing of the rutile (101) planes. The typical TEM image of the HNTs is shown in Fig. 3(d), which clearly shows a number of TiO2 nanosheets with a thickness of less than 10 nm on the NRs. Fig. 3(e) displays an HRTEM image taken from the interfacial region of the nanosheet and nanorods (marked in Fig. 3(d)), which illustrates the fine interconnection between the two parts. Fig. 3(f) and (g) show the FFT patterns of the rutile trunk and anatase branch, respectively, indicating that the two parts have separate lattice structure. Fig. 3  (a, b)TEM and HRTEM images of the rutile NRs with the corresponding fast Fourier transfer (FFT) patterns (c); (d) TEM image of the HNTs; (e) HRTEM images of the region marked with white dotted circles in (d); and (f, g) the FFT patterns of the rutile trunk and anatase branch, respectively. In the secondary hydrothermal experiments, the alkali environment with a certain amount of H2O2 was essential for the formation of the hierarchical structures. It was suggested that the generation of titanate was a dissolution-growth process. In the presence of H2O2, the exterior parts of the rutile NRs were firstly dissolved in the alkali solution and transformed into the peroxotitanium complex32 (reaction (1)). Then, the complex reacted with NaOH to form titanate according to reaction (2):33 TiO2 + nH2O2 + 2H2O → [Ti(H2O2)n·(OH)4−n]n+(OH)n−(1) 2[Ti(H2O2)n·(OH)4−n]n+(OH)n− + 2NaOH → Na2TiO5·H2O + (2n+4)H2O + nO2(2)Since the surface energy at the edges of the nanorods was higher than that on the faces, the dissolution was faster and the concentration of the complex was higher around the edges. The titanate nuclei were then generated and adsorbed on the edges nearby. With the progress of reaction, titanate nanosheets grew on the edges, so the HNT arrays showed the tetragonal appearance from the top view.Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of NR and HNT arrays after the deposition of quantum dots. The NR surface is covered by the quantum dots with the size of about 10–20 nm. There are also QDs decorated on the nanosheets. The increased QDs would improve the light absorption, which is confirmed by the absorption spectra and photographs in Fig. 4(e). Fig. 4  SEM images of NRs (a, c) and HNTs (b, d) after QD deposition; (e) Absorption spectra of pristine NR, HNT, quantum dot-sensitized NR and HNT arrays. The inset is the photograph taken from the FTO backside. The QDSSC performance of the rutile NR and HNT arrays is shown in Fig. 5(a). The rutile NR array-based QDSSC shows the short-circuit current (JSC) of 6.6 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.525 V, conversion efficiency (η) of 1.64% and fill factor (FF) of 0.48. After the post treatment, the HNT-based QDSSC shows the JSC of 8.7 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.587 V, η of 2.4% and FF of 0.47. The improvements in JSC and VOC contributed to the increased efficiency. The incident monochromatic photo-to-electron (IPCE) conversion efficiency (Fig. 5(b)) which reflects the photocurrent response at different wavelengths is consistent with the I–V curves. Fig. 5  (a) I–V curve of the QDSSC assembled from the rutile NR array and the HNT array; (b) IPCE of the QDSSC assembled from the NR and HNT arrays; (c) diffusion coefficient of electrons in different QDSSCs, the inset is the scheme of the band edge in the rutile/anatase complex phases; and (d) electron lifetime in different QDSSCs. As indicated in the equation: ηIPCE = ηlhηimjηcol, the IPCE result is determined by the light harvesting efficiency of the film (ηlh), the injection (ηinj) and collection efficiencies (ηcol) of the photoelectrons, which are generally wavelength dependent and strongly affected by the structure of the photoelectrode. The nanotree structure has improved the light harvesting efficiency, which contributed to the increased IPCE and JSC. The collection efficiency equation: ,34 in which τc is the collection time and τr is the recombination lifetime, means an efficient electron transfer process requires both short transport time and long lifetime.In order to further investigate the relation between the hetero-structure and the QDSSC performance, the charge transport and recombination dynamics have been studied, as shown in Fig. 5(c). The characteristic time for electron diffusion (collection) in the cell was measured by photo-current transient measurements and the diffusion coefficient (D) could be calculated by the equation: D = d2/2.35τC.35 In this equation, d is the thickness of the film, τC is the collection time at different bias voltage. Under conditions of no voltage bias, the HNT shows the D of 3.9 × 10−9 m2 s−1, while the NR shows the D of 2.1 × 10−9 m2 s−1, indicating that the electron transport is faster in HNT film. Though the bulk anatase has faster electron mobility than the bulk rutile, there is no comparison between the electron mobilities in the anatase nanosheets and the rutile nanorods because rutile nanorods have the advantage of 1D structure in charge transport.36 Besides, the electrons still need to transport through the NR to the substrate, so we weakened the individual effect of anatase nanosheets on the electron diffusion. In previous papers, the electron diffusion coefficient in dye-sensitized solar cells exhibits a power law dependence on photocharge,37 so the increased photoelectrons by the enlarged surface area may improve the diffusion coefficient in QDSSCs. Besides, the phase junction was also considered as the reason for the accelerated electron transport. Since the conduction band of anatase is higher than that of the rutile phase, the energy difference between the two sides provides a driving force for the electron injection from anatase branches to rutile trunks, as is shown in Fig. 5(c), which accelerates the electron transport at the interface. There were reports on the use of the phase junction to reduce the recombination; however, few research studies reported the synthesis of the hierarchical nanotrees with the phase junction and confirmed its effect on the electron transport.The diffusion coefficient decreased with the increased bias voltage. According to previous reports, the bias voltage applied to the FTO layer will produce a gradient in the Fermi level across the TiO2 film, providing a driving force for the diffusion of photoinjected electrons toward or away from the FTO/TiO2 interface.38,39 The higher the bias voltage, the flatter the gradient in NRs would be, decreasing the flow rate of electrons to the substrate. According to our result, the change in the Fermi level of the film would also weaken the energy difference at the interface, thus the slowing down of electron diffusion in HNT is very dramatic.The open-circuit voltage decay was employed to investigate the electron lifetime in QDSSCs (Fig. 5(d)). The open-circuit potential of solar cell device is monitored as a function of time when the light is switched off. We could get the recombination lifetime (τr) using the equation:40  e the electron charge, kB the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature. It was found that there was no obvious difference in the lifetime of electrons in HNTs and NRs at different VOC. This indicated that the electron recombination could not be restricted nor accelerated by introducing the anatase nanosheets.The VOC equation in QDSSC device was expressed as:41  where R is the molar gas constant, T the temperature, F the Faraday constant, β the reaction order for Sn− and electrons, A the electrode area, I the incident photon flux, n0 the concentration of accessible electronic states in the conduction band, kb the kinetic constant of the back-reaction of the injected electrons with polysulfide electrolyte, and kr the kinetic constant of the recombination of these electrons with oxidized QDs (D+), respectively. Though the photon flux did not change, the increased light absorption due to the increased surface area would elevate the injected electrons to the photoanode, which would elevate the VOC effectively. The recombination lifetime result indicated that the back-reaction constant was similar in these two structures, which supported the favorable effect of more electron injection on VOC. The CB edge of anatase was higher than that of rutile, so the rutile CB edge may be elevated in the energy level reorganization process, which could also contribute to the VOC improvement.42ConclusionsIn summary, we employed a two-step hydrothermal process to fabricate the rutile trunk/anatase branch hetero-structured TiO2 nanotree arrays on FTO substrates and applied them as photoanodes in QDSSCs. Compared to the NR arrays, the HNT arrays exhibited dual advantages for QDSSC application. The nanosheets on the NRs increased the surface area, the amount of the deposited quantum dots and thus the light absorption of the cells. Besides, the phase junctions formed between the rutile trunks and anatase nanosheets could somewhat accelerate the electron transport in QDSSCs. When employing the HNT array in QDSSCs instead of a NR array, the conversion efficiency increased from ∼1.6% to 2.4%, attributed to the improvement in JSC and VOC.Experimental sectionPreparation of the rutile nanorod (NR) and hetero-structured nanotree (HNT) arraysThe rutile nanorod (NR) array was growing on the FTO by the hydrothermal method corresponding to the previous reports using an aqueous solution of HCl and titanium isopropoxide at 150 °C for 12 h.29 After washing several times with deionized water, the samples were annealed at 450 °C for 0.5 h to improve the connection between the nanorods and the substrate. Then, the samples were put into 20 ml 4 M NaOH solution with 250 μL hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 120 °C for 2 h. Finally, the products were soaked in 0.01 M HNO3 for H+ exchange and then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1.CharacterizationThe crystal structure determination and phase identification of the samples were performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.1542 nm, 40 kV, 100 mA) and using Renishaw's inVia Raman microscope system. XRD and Raman patterns were detected by using the samples standing on the FTO glasses. Morphologies of NR and HNT films were observed using a cold field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800) with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) were performed using a FEI Tecnai F30 operated at 300 kV. The samples for TEM and HRTEM characterization were scraped from the FTO glasses, dispersed in ethanol, and then dropped on the small grids. The absorption spectra were recorded on the U-4100 spectrophotometer in reflection mode.Device fabricationA chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique was employed to assemble CdS and CdSe quantum dots in sequence on the photoanodes.39,43 All the QD (CdS and CdSe) depositions were carried out at 10 °C. CdS was deposited in the solution containing 20 mM CdCl2, 66 mM NH4Cl, 140 mM thiourea and 230 mM ammonia with a final pH ca. 9.5 for about 1 h. The films were then washed with water. Subsequently, CdSe was deposited in the solution with 26 mM CdSO4, 40 mM N(CH2COONa)3 and 26 mM Na2SeSO3. The CdSe deposition was maintained for 6 h. Finally, the photoanodes were passivated with ZnS by twice dipping into 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2 and Na2S aqueous solution for 1 min alternately. Cu2S on brass was employed as the counter-electrode. The brass sheets were immersed in the 37% HCl aqueous solution at 70 °C for 10 min, and then put into the polysulfide electrolyte (1 M Na2S and 1 M S) for 10 s. The photoanode and counter-electrode were annealed under N2 atmosphere at 100 °C for 10 min. The two electrodes were sandwiched together with the electrolyte (1 M Na2S and 1 M S) injected into the cell from the edges by capillary action.Electrochemical measurementsPhotocurrent–voltage measurements were performed on a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system using simulated AM 1.5 sunlight with an output power of 100 mW cm−2 produced by a solar simulator (Newport 69911). The open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurement was also tested on the equipment. When the VOC of QDSSCs reaches equilibrium under 100 mW cm−2, the illumination was cut off, and the plot of VOCvs. time (t) was recorded.Photocurrent transient measurementsIn our experiment, the high-intensity light-emitting diodes (LED, 530 nm) was used as the pulsed excitation light source to generate the transient photocurrent signal. The pulsed light LED was driven by a self-made pulse amplifier, excitation light intensity was set as 2 mJ per pulse with a duration of 50 ms. Light from the LED was collected by lens groups and imaged on the QDSSCs surface, the size of light spot is ∼8 mm × 8 mm. A DC regulated power supply was used to generate various steady voltages opposite the photovoltage. A current preamplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR445A) was used before the signals were sent to the oscilloscope.AcknowledgementsThis work is supported by NSFC (grant no. 50821061, 21073007, 51121091 and 21133001), MSTC (NKBRSF, grant no. 2014CB239303, 2013CB932601 and 2011CB808702), and STEISCL (9140C150304110C1502).ReferencesF.
