    , Accepted 12th February 2019First published on 12th February 2019AbstractConfinement or dimensionality reduction is a novel strategy to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity and, consequently, to improve the thermoelectric conversion performance. Bismuth and tellurium based low-dimensional materials have great potential in this regard. The phonon transport and thermoelectric properties of Bi2Te2X (X = S, Se, Te) monolayers are systematically investigated by employing density functional theory and the Boltzmann transport equation. The calculated lattice thermal conductivity of these 2D systems ranges from ∼1.3 W m−1 K−1 (Bi2Te2Se) to ∼1.5 W m−1 K−1 (Bi2Te3) for a 10 μm system size at room temperature and considering spin–orbit coupling in harmonic force constants. This remarkably low lattice thermal conductivity is attributed to small group velocities and enhanced anharmonic phonon scattering rates. A detailed analysis is presented in terms of mode-level phonon group velocities, anharmonic scattering rates and phonon mean free paths. Our results reveal that the thermal transport in these 2D systems is dominated by in-plane transverse acoustic modes. Additionally, the thermal conductivity can be further reduced by decreasing the sample size due to phonon-boundary scattering. The thermoelectric properties including the Seebeck coefficient, power factor and electrical conductivity are calculated using the semi-classical Boltzmann transport equation within the rigid band approximation. The low thermal conductivities coupled with their high carrier mobilities lead to good thermoelectric power factors. With optimal carrier doping, a figure of merit ∼0.6 can be achieved at room temperature, which increases to ∼0.8 at 700 K, thus making them promising candidates for thermoelectric applications.
1 Introduction
The exfoliation of atomically thin graphene1 triggered tremendous research interest in the discovery and design of new 2D materials. Despite its excellent carrier mobility2 and ultrahigh mechanical strength,3,4 the intrinsic metallic nature (zero band-gap) of graphene renders it unsuitable for many electronic applications, for instance, field-effect transistors. Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides5–8 possess finite band-gaps, which make them suitable for field effect transistors,9 thin film solar cells, metal-ion batteries,10,11 and thermoelectric devices.12,13 Many other semiconducting 2D materials with interesting properties have been explored, e.g., phosphorene,14–16 silicene,17,18 germanene,19 stanene,20 tellurene,21,22 group-IIIA/group-IVA chalcogenides,23,24etc. Because of their novel properties and promising applications, the discovery and design of a fascinating variety of 2D materials is a leading research area in materials science and condensed matter physics.
The thermal conductivity of these 2D materials is an important property from the point of view of many technological applications such as thermoelectrics and thermal management in (opto)electronics. A very high thermal conductivity is a desired feature for thermal management in high performance devices to effectively remove the heat generated by dissipated power. On the other hand, materials with very low thermal conductivities form the basis of a new generation of thermoelectric devices to convert waste heat directly into electric power. The energy conversion efficiency of a thermoelectric material is quantified by a dimensionless quantity called the thermoelectric figure of merit, which is defined as ZT = S2σT/(κe + κ), where S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical conductivity of the material, T is the absolute temperature, and κe and κ are the electronic and the lattice thermal conductivity, respectively. Since these quantities are coupled with each other, achieving a high figure of merit or ZT value has remained a formidable challenge. To increase ZT, one mainstream strategy is to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity.
Bulk Bi2Te3 has long been known for its best thermoelectric performance due to its low thermal conductivity and high figure of merit.25 To further enhance the figure of merit, nanostructuring of the bulk material is considered a novel approach.26,27 Nanostructures of Bi2Te3, i.e., nanowires (quasi-1D systems) and nanosheets (2D) have also been synthesised and extensively studied.28–33 In the case of Bi2Te3 nanowires, however, experiments have shown that the Seebeck coefficient is considerably suppressed when compared to that of the bulk.28,29 The underlying reasons for this anomalous behaviour are yet to be explored. More recently, ultra-thin 2D layers of Bi2Te2Se and Bi2Te3 have been synthesised and found to exhibit very interesting surface properties.34–37 The atoms in these 2D systems are arranged in five (quintuple) layers, which are covalently bonded. These quintuple layers interact weakly through van der Waals interactions to form the bulk crystal. Theoretical studies on the thermoelectric response of single quintuple layer Bi2Te3 have shown that the p-doped system has a significantly better thermoelectric figure of merit than the n-doped system.38 Further theoretical studies have shown39 that monolayers of Bi2Te2S and Bi2Te2Se have moderate band-gaps (∼0.7 eV), very high electron mobilities, and show excellent absorption in the whole range of the solar spectrum, which makes them promising candidates for future high-speed (opto)electronics devices. Since these monolayers are composed of heavy elements Bi and Te, their thermal conductivities are expected to be very low. It is, therefore, worth exploring the thermal transport properties of these monolayers for their thermoelectric applications.
In this work, we systematically investigate the lattice dynamics and thermal conductivity of semiconducting Bi2Te2X (X = S, Se, Te) monolayers. In metallic and heavily doped-semiconductors, both electrons and phonons act as heat carriers, whereas, in semiconductors and insulators, most of the heat is carried by the phonons. The electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity is almost negligible and can safely be ignored. To calculate κ, we iteratively solve the linearised phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). The key quantities required to solve the BTE are calculated using density functional theory. We demonstrate that small acoustic group velocities and enhanced phonon scattering rates in these 2D systems lead to low thermal conductivities. To further explore the energy conversion efficiency of these systems, the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, electronic thermal conductivity and figure of merit are calculated within the framework of the semi-classical BTE. We show that these 2D materials have attractive thermoelectric properties.
2 Methodology
In the formalism of the linearised phonon Boltzmann transport equation the lattice thermal conductivity, κ, is calculated as:40 (1)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, V is the volume of the unit cell, T is the absolute temperature and N is the total number of q points uniformly spaced in the Brillouin zone. λ denotes a phonon mode with a branch index p and wave vector q. ωλ is the angular frequency, υαλ represents the component of the group velocity along the α direction and f0λ is the Bose–Einstein distribution function for the phonon population. Fβλ is the projection of the mean free displacement in the β direction and is determined as: Fλ = τ0λ(vλ + Δλ)(2)where τ0λ represents the relaxation time of the phonon mode λ as obtained from perturbation theory, which is commonly used in the relaxation time approximation (RTA), and Δλ, with dimensions of velocity, is a correction term, which will remove the deviation predicted by the RTA.41–43 The inverse of τ0λ is equal to the total scattering rate, which is a sum of the isotope scattering rate and the anharmonic scattering rate. The anharmonic scattering rate can be obtained as the sum of three-phonon transition probabilities and can be expressed as: (3)where the upper and the lower term in the curly brackets have plus and minus signs and represent absorption and emission processes, respectively, and the Dirac δ-function enforces the energy conservation in these processes. The scattering matrix elements  in eqn (3) are calculated from anharmonic interatomic force constants (IFCs)40,44Φαβγijk as: (4)where α, β, and γ represent Cartesian coordinates, Mi is the mass of the ith atom in the system and eαλ(i) denotes the αth component of the eigenvector of mode λ at the ith atom. The summation index i runs over the atoms in the central-cell while j and k run over the atoms in the entire system.

κ
 is determined mainly by phonon frequencies (ωλ), group velocities (υλ) and anharmonic three-phonon scattering as discussed above. In addition to intrinsic phonon–phonon scattering, phonon-boundary scattering can also play a significant role in affecting κ. The phonon-boundary scattering can be estimated using the following empirical expression:13,45 (5)where L represents the sample size, which can range from tens of nanometers to several micrometers in real systems.
All quantities required to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity are obtained from harmonic and anharmonic IFCs. These IFCs were calculated using density functional theory in the plane-wave formalism as implemented in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).46,47 The initial 2D structures of the Bi2Te2X series were taken from a recently published database of monolayers.48 Subsequently, these structures were fully relaxed using DFT with the projector augmented wave (PAW) method49 and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional.50 A vacuum space equal to 28 Å perpendicular to the axis of the 2D layers (along the z-axis) was used in all calculations in order to avoid any spurious interaction between the periodic images of the monolayers. In the geometry relaxation, the Brillouin zone was sampled using a 15 × 15 × 1 Γ-centred k-mesh. An energy threshold of 10−8 eV and a force threshold of 10−4 eV Å−1 were used for the convergence of, respectively, the SCF and maximum component of Hellmann–Feynman forces on individual atoms in the geometry optimisation. After structure relaxation, the harmonic and anharmonic IFCs were calculated by applying small-displacement within real-space supercell approaches using the PHONOPY package51 for harmonic IFCs and the ShengBTE package40 for anharmonic IFCs. A 5 × 5 × 1 supercell size and 3 × 3 × 1 Γ-centred k-mesh were used in these calculations. We have also considered spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects (PBE + SOC) in structure relaxation and in the calculations of the harmonic IFCs. Considering that the calculations with SOC are computationally very expensive, the third-order IFCs were calculated without SOC. We note that the lattice thermal conductivity is much more sensitive to the second-order IFCs than the third-order IFCs.52 Additionally, in previous theoretical studies on Bi, it has been found that the SOC effects in third-order anharmonic constants are weak and can safely be ignored.53 To obtain anharmonic IFCs, a cut-off value equal to 6.5 Å was used for the interaction range among the neighbouring atoms. For the harmonic IFCs, the acoustic sum rules were enforced using the PHONOPY package51 while the Lagrange multiplier technique was used to enforce the translational invariance of anharmonic IFCs.40,44 Born effective charges and dielectric constants were calculated using density functional perturbation theory, which were used to apply a non analytical correction to the dynamical matrix to produce longitudinal and transverse optical phonons. The harmonic and anharmonic force constants were fed to the ShengBTE code40 to solve the phonon Boltzmann transport equation iteratively. In the iterative solution of the BTE, the convergence with respect to the q-grid sampling of the Brillouin zone was tested. To get the final κ values, a volume correction to eqn (1) was applied by excluding the vacuum space from the thickness, d, of the monolayers. For each system, the value of d was chosen as the distance between the top and bottom Te atoms plus the van der Waals diameter of the Te atom as shown in Fig. 1(c).

The electronic band structures were calculated using conventional DFT (PBE), as well as using a hybrid functional (HSE06) and including SOC effects (PBE + SOC and HSE06 + SOC). The thermoelectric properties, viz. the Seebeck coefficient, power factor and electronic thermal conductivity, were calculated by solving the semi-classical Boltzmann transport equation within the rigid band approximation as implemented in the BoltzTraP package.54 Such a combined approach has previously been applied to study the thermoelectric properties of many materials and has been found to provide satisfactory and predictive results.55–59
3 Results and discussion
A graphical representation of the optimised structures of the monolayers is shown in Fig. 1(a)–(c). The optimised structures are similar in the three cases and belong to the p3m1 planar space group. Fig. 1(d) shows the Brillouin zone and the symmetry points in the plane. The Γ-point is the centre of the Brillouin zone, K-points are corners of the Brillouin zone, and M-points are the centres of the edges of the Brillouin zone. Using PBE, the optimised lattice constants for the primitive hexagonal cell are (a = b =) 4.286 Å for Bi2Te2S, 4.338 Å for Bi2Te2Se and 4.428 Å for Bi2Te3, which are in good agreement with the previously reported values.39,48 We note that considering SOC in the structure relaxation increases the lattice constants by about 0.2% to 4.295 Å for Bi2Te2S, 4.348 Å for Bi2Te2Se and 4.438 Å for Bi2Te3. The thickness d of these monolayers is 11.237 Å for Bi2Te2S, 11.430 Å for Bi2Te2Se and 11.737 Å for Bi2Te3 in the case of SOC included. We also checked the configurations with the X atom sitting at the surface layer instead of the middle layer. Such configurations are, however, energetically less stable, and hence not considered further.
The electronic band structures of these monolayers using PBE, HSE06, PBE + SOC and HSE06 + SOC are presented in Fig. 2. The band structures show that these monolayers are semiconductors with indirect band gaps. The band gaps obtained with PBE are 0.92 eV, 0.85 eV and 0.93 eV for Bi2Te2S, Bi2Te2Se and Bi2Te3, respectively, which decrease to 0.34 eV, 0.29 eV and 0.27 eV when SOC is included (PBE + SOC). It is well known that the PBE functional tends to underestimate the band gap and hybrid functionals give more accurate values. We also calculated the band structures employing the HSE hybrid functional with 25% Hartree–Fock exchange and including SOC. It has been found that the HSE hybrid functional increases the band gap to 1.39 eV (Bi2Te2S), 1.33 eV (Bi2Te2Se) and 1.36 eV (Bi2Te3) while SOC (HSE + SOC) decreases these values to 0.68 eV (Bi2Te2S), 0.61 eV (Bi2Te2Se) and 0.53 eV (Bi2Te3). Further, it can be seen that the band gap values obtained using HSE + SOC are almost twice as large as those calculated using PBE + SOC, consistent with the fact that PBE typically underestimates the band gaps for semiconductors. The calculated electronic bands structures of these monolayers are in excellent agreement with the previous reports.38,39

The phonon dispersions of these monolayers along the high symmetry directions in the first Brillouin zone are shown in Fig. 3. No imaginary phonon frequency was found for any system, which indicates the stability of these systems. In the phonon dispersion, the in-plane transverse acoustic (TA) branch and longitudinal acoustic (LA) branch show linear dispersion in the vicinity of the Γ-point, whereas the out-of-plane flexural acoustic (ZA) branch shows quadratic dispersion which is a characteristic feature of 2D materials.60 The acoustic phonon frequencies decrease slightly with increasing mass of the X atom. For optical branches above 2 THz, the shift in frequencies with the mass of the X atom is more pronounced. The maximum frequency of vibration is 6.49 THz in the Bi2Te2S case due to the presence of the light-weight S atom, which decreases to 4.53 THz in Bi2Te2Se and 4.23 THz in Bi2Te3. Fig. 3(a)–(c) also shows that the SOC tends to shift the phonon frequencies towards lower energy and the effect is more pronounced for the optical branches. Fig. 3(d) shows that the acoustic phonon modes become slightly softer with the increasing mass of the X atom though the difference is really small. This can lead to very similar phonon related properties (thermal conductivity) for these three systems.

Fig. 4(a) shows the phonon group velocities of these monolayers obtained using harmonic IFCs calculated without considering SOC. In the long-wavelength limit, the group velocities for the acoustic modes decrease with increasing mass of the X atom, due to decreased phonon frequencies. The sound velocities are 1865 m s−1 (2673 m s−1) in Bi2Te2S, 1748 m s−1 (2492 m s−1) in Bi2Te2Se and 1558 m s−1 (2287 m s−1) in Bi2Te3 for the TA (LA) modes. These group velocities are substantially smaller than those in many other 2D systems like graphene,61 MoS2,12 phosphorene,62 and dumbbell and low-buckled silicene63 and comparable to those in stanene,64 SnS2 and SnSe2.65 When SOC effects are included in harmonic IFCs, the group velocities are slightly decreased, Fig. 4(b), especially for the acoustic modes. In general, the low frequencies of acoustic modes and small group velocities already suggest low κ for these 2D systems.

To get accurate values of the lattice thermal conductivity, we first focus on the convergence of κ with respect to the q-grid density of the Brillouin zone using a sample size L = 10 μm and with naturally occurring isotopic concentrations. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the variation of κ as a function of the q-grid density, without and with SOC included. For q points N1 = N2 ≥ 150, the variation in κ is within 3% when SOC effects are neglected, which ensures that these results are well converged. When SOC effects are included in harmonic IFCs, the variation in κ with q-grid N1 = N2 ≥ 150 is even smaller. In all further κ calculations a 150 × 150 × 1 q-grid was used.
 Fig. 5  (a–b) Convergence of κ with respect to the q-grid (N1 × N2 × 1) in the first Brillouin zone at 300 K, and (c–d) variation of κ as a function of temperature, using L = 10 μm and with naturally occurring isotopic concentrations. The results in the left panel were obtained with PBE calculated harmonic IFCs while those in the right panel were obtained using PBE + SOC calculated harmonic IFCs. 
The calculated κ values for these systems are shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d) as a function of temperature and by employing harmonic IFCs calculated using PBE and PBE + SOC. These curves were calculated using L = 10 μm and with naturally occurring isotopic concentrations. At a given temperature, the κ values are quite similar in the three cases, for instance, at room temperature these values are 3.96 W m−1 K−1 for Bi2Te2S, 3.92 W m−1 K−1 for Bi2Te2Se and 3.67 W m−1 K−1 for Bi2Te3 when PBE-calculated harmonic IFCs are used. The value of κ decreases to 1.24 W m−1 K−1 for Bi2Te2S, 1.35 W m−1 K−1 for Bi2Te2Se and 1.47 W m−1 K−1 for Bi2Te3 when SOC effects are included due to reduced phonon dispersion. Also κ decreases with increasing temperature and follows 1/T behaviour which is characteristic of three-phonon scattering processes. As mentioned before, these systems have very similar acoustic phonon frequencies and group velocities. Since κ is mainly determined by acoustic modes, the nature of the X atom does not affect the calculated thermal conductivity, thus leading to very similar κ values in the three cases. Further calculations on isotopically pure systems have shown that κ is insensitive to phonon-isotope scattering, which indicates that the thermal transport in these monolayers is mainly determined by anharmonic three phonon scattering processes. The anharmonic scattering rates increase linearly with temperature and thus lead to decreased κ. Moreover, the symmetry of these systems results in isotropic values of thermal conductivities. It is also evident that the mass of the X atom has no appreciable effect on the calculated thermal conductivity values.
Recent theoretical work on a Bi2Te3 single quintuple layer has reported38 a κ value ∼2.5 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K. Our calculated value of κ (1.47 W m−1 K−1 in the case of SOC included) is lower than that report. The main reason for this small discrepancy could be the acoustic (ZA) phonon frequencies. It has been pointed out in the literature60 that the ZA phonon branch in 2D materials should be quadratic in q in the vicinity of the Γ-point. The presence or absence of a quadratic ZA branch can affect, consequently, the calculated thermal conductivity significantly. In ref. 38, all the acoustic phonon branches are linear in q near the vicinity of the Γ-point and that leads to a different value of calculated κ when compared to our results. In our calculations, the ZA phonon branch is quadratic in q in all three cases, which results in a lower value of κ.
To explore the origin of these low values of thermal conductivities, we look into different quantities which determine κ in detail. Fig. 6(a) shows the variation of the scattering rates as a function of the q-grid density for the three acoustic branches in the Bi2Te2S system. It can be seen that the scattering rates are well converged for q points N1 = N2 ≥ 125. The scattering rates obtained with PBE-calculated harmonic IFCs are shown in Fig. 6(b). The scattering rates for Bi2Te2Se and Bi2Te3 are quantitatively very similar while those for Bi2Te2S, at low frequency, are marginally higher than those in the other two systems. These scattering rates are considerably higher than those for MoS2,12 phosphorene,62 and stanene64 and comparable to those for dumbbell silicene63 and group IV–VI monolayers.66 At low frequency, below 0.2 THz, the scattering rates show strong branch dependence behaviour. For the out-of-plane ZA mode, the scattering rates follow a ω0.8 dependence, whereas for the TA and LA branches the scattering rates follow ω2 dependences. Compared to that in graphene, these power-law dependences of the scattering rates are quite different. In the case of graphene, the scattering rates of the LA and TA modes approach a constant value in the long wavelength limit, whereas for the out-of-plane flexural mode, the scattering rates follow a ω2 dependence.67,68 Here in Bi2Te2X 2D systems, the scattering rates of LA and TA branches exhibit a ω2 dependence. When the SOC effect is included in harmonic IFCs, Fig. 6(c), the scattering rates for the ZA branches in Bi2Te2S and Bi2Te3 become slightly higher than the ZA branch in the Bi2Te2Se system. Also the total scattering rates slightly increase when compared to those in Fig. 6(b) where SOC effects are neglected in harmonic IFCs. The analysis of three-phonon scattering processes revealed that these power-law dependences are dominated by absorption processes.

The cumulative thermal conductivity as a function of phonon frequency in a lattice system is another useful quantity, which indicates the contribution of phonons with different frequencies to the total κ. Fig. 7(a) shows the cumulative thermal conductivity versus phonon frequency for the three systems. In the case of Bi2Te2S, phonons with frequency below ∼1 THz contribute about 58% to κ, while this contribution increases to about 66% in the case of Bi2Te2Se and 70% in Bi2Te3. The low frequency phonons have increased contribution to the thermal conductivity, mainly due to increased group velocities and low scattering rates. Fig. 7(b) shows that the TA mode dominates the contribution (30–40%) at low frequency in all three systems. The next major contribution (21–26%) comes from LA modes, while the ZA mode contributes about 12–16% to the total κ. In general, the thermal transport in these systems is dominated by the TA mode. The cumulative lattice thermal conductivity as a function of the phonon mean free path, Λ, gives the contribution from all phonons with mean free paths below a given value to the total κ, which is plotted in Fig. 7(c). The cumulative κ increases with Λ and then saturates to a maximum value. All the phonons with mean free paths between ∼1 nm and 10 μm contribute to κ demonstrating that κ can be further reduced drastically when the sample size is even smaller than 10 μm. The low values of κ suggest that these 2D systems can be promising for thermoelectric applications.

Next, we calculate the thermoelectric transport properties of these systems, which mainly depend on the electronic band structure. The electrical conductivity, σ, Seebeck coefficient, S, power factor, S2σ, and electronic thermal conductivity, κe, were calculated within the rigid band approximation using the BoltzTraP package.54 Within the framework of the semi-classical Boltzmann transport equation, σ, κe and the power factor can be estimated only when the carrier relaxation time, τk, is known, which in turn depends on the band and temperature. The BoltzTraP code calculates σ and κe in terms of τk. The value of τk is often estimated by fitting to some experimental data.55,59 In previous theoretical studies a constant value of τk (= 1 × 10−14) has also been employed to estimate these transport coefficients for group IV–VI monolayers.57 Alternatively, τk can be calculated either by considering explicitly the scattering mechanism due to electron–phonon coupling69–73 or by using the deformation potential approximation for electron–phonon coupling.74–77 In the latter approach, once the carrier effective mass and the deformation potential is known, τk can be estimated using the following relation:74,75 (6)where m* is the effective mass of the electron, Ξ is the acoustic deformation potential, ρs is the areal mass density and υs is the sound velocity. The calculated effective masses using HSE06 + SOC along the Γ–M/Γ–K direction (m/m0 kg) are 0.095/0.103 for Bi2Te2S, 0.092/0.100 for Bi2Te2Se and 0.084/0.096 for Bi2Te3. The effective masses for Bi2Te2S and Bi2Te2Se are in excellent agreement with the previously reported values using HSE06 + SOC calculations.39 The HSE06 + SOC-calculated Ξ values for Bi2Te2S and Bi2Te2Se were taken from ref. 39. Considering that the effective mass of Bi2Te3 is similar to Bi2Te2Se, the same value of Ξ is used for both cases. To calculate the relaxation time, an average value of m* along Γ–M and Γ–K is used for each system. The calculated relaxation time using eqn (6) is plotted in Fig. 8 as a function of temperature. The calculated values of σ, S, the power factor, κe and ZT are presented in Fig. 9 as a function of chemical potential, εf, at three different temperatures. Fig. 9(a) shows that Bi2Te2S has the largest σ value for p-type carriers, which slightly decreases when S is replaced by Se or Te. A quite large value of σ can be achieved by increasing the chemical potential. The value of S, Fig. 9(b), on the other hand, attains a maximum value near the Fermi-level and then decreases with increasing potential. At a given temperature, the S values for the three systems are very similar and are 2355 μV K−1 (for Bi2Te2S), 2239 μV K−1 (for Bi2Te2Se) and 2280 μV K−1 (for Bi2Te3) at 300 K. The enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient in these 2D systems is remarkably large when compared to the reported S values of bulk Bi2Te2Se (480/350 μV K−1 for p/n-type doping at 300 K) and Bi2Te3 (320/260 μV K−1 for p/n-type doping at 300 K).78 Also these values are comparable to those reported for other 2D materials with impressive thermoelectric properties, like SnSe,55 SiS/SiSe56 and group IV–VI monolayers.57 Both σ and S are quite sensitive to temperature and decrease rapidly with increasing temperature. We note that for SnSe allotropes, it has been reported that S increases with temperature.59 However, in the Bi2Te2X case, like in the bulk Bi2Te2Se and Bi2Te3 and many other 2D systems,55–57S decreases with increasing temperature. Fig. 9(c) and (d) show that the power factor and κe decrease slightly in the following order Bi2Te2Se > Bi2Te2S > Bi2Te3 for p-type carriers, whereas for n-type carriers follow almost the reverse order. For p-type doping at room temperature, the power factor for 2D Bi2Te2Se is almost 25% higher than the corresponding bulk value,78 whereas for 2D Bi2Te3 the improvement is less impressive (∼7% increase). The calculated ZT values for the three systems, Fig. 9(e), are very similar at a given temperature and for p-type carriers are larger than for n-type carriers. At room temperature and with optimal p-type doping, a ∼0.6 ZT value can be achieved which increases to ∼0.8 at 700 K.

4 Conclusion
In summary, using the phonon Boltzmann transport equation and density functional theory calculations, we have investigated the lattice dynamics and phonon transport properties of Bi2Te2S, Bi2Te2Se and Bi2Te3 monolayers, e.g., phonon dispersion, group velocities, anharmonic phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity. It has been shown that these systems have low acoustic phonon frequencies, small phonon group velocities and high phonon–phonon scattering rates, which lead to low lattice thermal conductivities. Unlike graphene and many other 2D materials, the thermal transport in these 2D systems is dominated by the in-plane transverse acoustic mode. The low thermal conductivities combined with their high carrier mobilities result in a good thermoelectric response with a ZT value ∼0.6 with optimal p-type doping at room temperature. These monolayers are promising candidates for thermoelectric applications.
