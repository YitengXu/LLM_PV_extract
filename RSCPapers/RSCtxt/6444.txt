    , Accepted 6th January 2019First published on 7th January 2019AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have attracted significant attention in the last few years owing to their high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) (of approximately 100%), narrow emission with a low full-width at half maximum (FWHM), and tunable optical bandgaps over the entire visible spectral range. Thus, perovskite materials are regarded as next-generation candidates for light-emitting diode application. Recently, perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with an external quantum efficiency of more than 20% have been successfully fabricated. Moreover, the efficiency and stability of PeLEDs have been significantly improved with the use of high-quality, uniform perovskite films. Here, the recent progress in the morphological control of perovskite films used in PeLEDs is reviewed. The current strategies involved in the morphological control of perovskite films to improve the device performance and long-term stability of PeLEDs via perovskite film modification, interface engineering, and quasi 2D-perovskite, are discussed.Jae Choul YuJae Choul Yu received his Ph.D. (February 2018) in Materials Science and Engineering from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) and was a postdoctoral researcher in Prof. Myoung Hoon Song's group in UNIST.

1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have been extensively studied owing to their superior optoelectronic properties, such as high carrier mobility, long-range balanced carrier transport, solution-processability, excellent photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), and tunable bandgap.1–6 In particular, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) has been significantly increased from 3.8 to 23.3% in only a few years. In addition to the successful use of perovskite materials in photovoltaics, excellent light-emitting diodes (LEDs)7–12 with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 20%, have been developed in a short period (see Fig. 1b).13–15 The emission wavelength of a perovskite film can be easily tuned from 400 nm to 780 nm by substituting halides into the perovskite crystals, making it possible to use these materials in wide-colour gamut LEDs in the future.7,16–20 Hence, several studies have been conducted in recent years to improve the efficiency of perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs), as shown in Fig. 1a.

The surface morphology of perovskite films is an important factor when it comes to obtaining high-efficiency PeLEDs, because the morphology and quality of perovskite films significantly affect the optical/electrical properties and device performance of PeLEDs.21–24 Yu et al. reported that a non-uniform perovskite film with pinholes leads to a shunt pathway between the perovskite layer and the charge transport layer (CTL), thereby decreasing the device performance.23 Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that the efficiency of PeLEDs can be significantly increased by reducing the perovskite grain size or by introducing a quasi-2D structure, i.e., by maximising the radiative recombination rate within the perovskite grains.9,25–28 Hence, it is important to obtain a uniform and dense perovskite film with a small grain size to enhance the efficiency of PeLEDs. However, the importance of morphology and quality of perovskite films when it comes to the performance and stability of PeLEDs has not been systematically studied, though high crystallinity and excellent morphology of perovskite films have been reported to substantially influence the photovoltaic performance of PeSCs.
In this review, we briefly explain the optical properties and application of perovskite materials used in light-emitting diodes and highlight the progress made in the morphological control of perovskite films towards realising high-performance stable PeLEDs.
2. Optical properties and application of perovskite materials used in LEDs
2.1. Optical properties of halide perovskite materials
The band gap energy of the materials strongly depends on the halide composition, and the emission spectra can vary from 390 to 790 nm, as shown in Fig. 1c. Moreover, the emission spectra can be extended using different cations (e.g. Cs+, FA+, or MA+).29,30
Halide-based perovskite materials exhibit very narrow emission spectra (full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 20 nm or lower) for a wide wavelength range (390 nm ≤ λ ≤ 1050 nm) depending on their inherent crystal structure.31 Their narrow emission spectra, coupled with optical bandgap tunability, enable a pure colour distribution covering a range greater than the National Television System Committee (NTSC) standard, as represented on a CIE chromaticity diagram (introduced by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage) shown in Fig. 1d.32,33 Furthermore, the high carrier mobility of perovskite materials (73 ± 58 cm2 V−1 s−1) makes them promising for optoelectronic applications.34
2.2. Light emitting diode application
Halide-based perovskite materials have emerged as promising candidates for LED application, owing to their easy colour tunability, high colour purity, and efficient charge transport property. One of the main challenges in obtaining efficient PeLEDs is the lack of radiative recombination under low charge carrier density (n = 1016 cm−3), which is in the device operation region.6 The charge carriers can pass through the perovskite layers with large grains without radiative recombination because of the significant charge carrier diffusion length.3 Moreover, trap-related non-radiative recombination dominates over radiative recombination at lower carrier densities.35 For an efficient radiative recombination, charge carrier confinement and high charge carrier density are required. In 2014, Friend et al. resolved the low exciton binding energy problem using ultrathin (∼20 nm) CH3NH3PbI3−xClx emissive layers.36 The charge carriers were well confined in the ultrathin perovskite layers, and efficient near-infrared (773 nm) PeLEDs with a maximum EQE (EQEmax) of 0.76% and a radiance of 13.2 W sr−1 m−2 were obtained. Since the first demonstration of PeLEDs at room temperature, several studies have been conducted on the fabrication of efficient PeLEDs. In particular, the morphology control of perovskite films is one of the most crucial factors, because fabricating a uniform pinhole-free perovskite film with a small grain size is essential for preventing shunt pathways and increasing the electron–hole capture rate.
3. Modification of perovskite layers
3.1. Additive-assisted perovskite film
It is well known that the SEM image of a MAPbBr3 perovskite film without any treatment shows inhomogeneous and incomplete surface coverage, as shown in Fig. 2a. An effective method to solve the morphological problem of perovskite films involves controlling the rate of perovskite crystallisation by adding an acid into the perovskite precursor.23,24,37 With this method, the solubility of the inorganic component increases and the crystallisation rate of the perovskite film decreases after the addition of acids into the perovskite precursor. Consequently, the low crystallisation rate (i.e. retarded nucleation time) helps form a uniform perovskite film with full surface coverage. PeLEDs with an enhanced efficiency (EQEmax of 0.1%) were obtained using this method.23

Another method of obtaining perovskite films with a uniform morphology involves preparing a perovskite:polymer composite film by mixing a polymer into the perovskite precursor. Such perovskite:polymer composite films have been found to exhibit enhanced morphology, improved flexibility, and property of water resistance.38–44 Li et al. used poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as an additive for the perovskite precursor in the fabrication of a perovskite:polymer composite film.38 The viscous PEO polymer hindered the diffusion of the perovskite precursor in the solvent drying stage during spin-coating. Moreover, it helped obtain a uniform perovskite film with small crystals in the PEO matrix. Finally, a PeLED with an enhanced efficiency (EQEmax of 0.165%) was obtained owing to the good surface morphology of the perovskite film and ionic conductivity of PEO. Such a perovskite:PEO composite film is found to be quite suitable for stretchable and flexible devices.45 Bade et al. fabricated stretchable PeLEDs comprising polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/PEO-doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/perovskite and a PEO composite film/In-Ga. The PeLEDs with a perovskite:PEO composite film exhibited reversible stretching up to a strain of 40% for 100 cycles without failure. Non-ionic polymers as an additive for the perovskite precursor have also been found to improve the morphological quality and device performance.41,42 Liu et al. recently used a non-ionic, dielectric polyethylene glycol (PEG):perovskite composite film for a PeLED.41 The presence of PEG in the perovskite film helps reduce the perovskite crystal size and passivate any non-radiative defects, thereby significantly enhancing the device performance. The ratio of perovskite precursor to PEG was further optimised, and the best-performing PeLEDs exhibited an EQEmax of 5.32%.
Organic molecule additives have also been used in the fabrication of uniform perovskite films for flexible PeLEDs.46–50 Zhao et al. studied the effects of several bulky organo-ammonium halide additives on the morphology and optoelectronic and mechanical properties of perovskite films. Using this approach with an optimised alkyl chain length, flexible PeLEDs with 4-fluorobenzylammonium iodide (FPMAI) exhibiting an EQEmax of 13% were obtained. The initial performance was maintained even after 10000 bending cycles at a radius of 2 mm. The above studies on additive-assisted perovskite films demonstrate the possibility of obtaining highly efficient, flexible PeLEDs.
3.2. Thermal annealing
The thermal annealing treatment can play a vital role in the fabrication of uniform and continuous perovskite films. Yu et al. reported that MAPbBr3 films under optimal annealing conditions show a continuous morphology with a high crystallinity, thereby enhancing device performance and stability.51 Notably, a PeLED with a perovskite film treated under 60 °C for 2 h showed excellent long-term stability, maintaining its initial luminance values even after 650 h (non-continuous test) of operation. However, the extreme annealing condition (80 °C and 100 °C) can induce the sublimation of MABr and lead to a discontinuous morphology of the perovskite films with vertical cracks, as shown in Fig. 3. The cracks in a perovskite film can lead to an increase in the leakage current, which in turn accelerates the sublimation of MABr and generates Joule heating in PeLEDs. This leads to decreased performance and poor long-term stability. Therefore, it is necessary to optimise the annealing temperature and time in the fabrication of highly efficient and stable PeLEDs. Furthermore, many studies have demonstrated that the device performance and long-term stability of PeLEDs can be improved by optimising the thermal annealing process applied to the perovskite films.52,53

3.3. Solvent engineering
Another strategy to obtain a uniform perovskite film involves using the solvent dropping method, which is called solvent engineering. Seok et al. employed a widely used solvent dropping method for PeSCs.54 By dropping solvents (e.g. toluene, diethyl ether, or chlorobenzene) that do not dissolve the perovskite precursors during the spin-coating stage, any polar solvents (e.g. γ-butyrolactone (GBL), dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) can be removed, and the perovskites can undergo immediate crystallisation, thus obtaining a uniform and dense perovskite film. However, the uniform and dense perovskite films (intended for PeSCs) fabricated using solvent dropping methods exhibit a large grain size. To obtain a highly efficient PeLED, the holes and electrons must be confined to facilitate their radiative recombination; therefore, the perovskite films must exhibit a small grain size or a confined structure to maximise device efficiency. Lee et al. reported a solvent engineering method with small molecules to obtain a dense and uniform perovskite film with small perovskite grains for PeLEDs, as shown in Fig. 4a.9 The solvent engineering method with small molecules (2,2′,2′′-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole)) (TPBi) effectively inhibited the crystal growth of perovskite and reduced the average grain size to 99 nm. The reduced perovskite crystal sizes helped increase the carrier radiative recombination in the perovskite film. Bright PeLEDs with an EQEmax of 8.53% were obtained. Song et al. fabricated uniform, defect-free, nanosized single-perovskite crystals using the solvent dropping method with phenylmethylamine (PMA), as shown in Fig. 4b.27 A perovskite film with nanosized single crystals (with an average diameter of 31.7 nm) is favourable to increase the radiative recombination rate by confining the charges within the perovskite grains, thus producing highly efficient PeLEDs with an EQEmax as high as 12.1%.

Yu et al. studied the effect of the type of dropping solvent used on the device performance of PeLEDs.55 Uniform perovskite films with full surface coverage were fabricated using dropping solvents having a high solvent polarity index, such as benzene and chlorobenzene, because this type of solvent can efficiently remove the DMSO solution from the perovskite film. In particular, chlorobenzene can passivate the defect site in the grain boundary of the perovskite crystals because of the chlorine atoms, thereby increasing the optical property via supressing the non-radiative decay. This result shows that using an appropriate dropping solvent can help obtain uniform perovskite films and effectively passivate the defect sites in the perovskite crystals.
3.4. Vapor-assisted perovskite film
The solvent vapor treatment method can also improve film crystallinity, grain size, and film morphology.56 It is well known that the larger perovskite grains reduce the total grain boundaries, resulting in a reduction in the defect sites in the perovskite crystal. Sun and co-workers used the anti-solvent vapor method to increase the perovskite grain size in the early stage of crystal growth.57 In addition, dielectric polymer:perovskite composite films subjected to anti-solvent vapour treatment exhibit significant enhancement in both PL efficiency and lifetime owing to the suppression of the trap state and reduction in the grain boundary. This approach can help fabricate a highly efficient PeLED with an EQEmax of 4.76%.
4. Interface engineering
The morphology of perovskite films is highly sensitive to the surface properties of the underlying substrates.58–62 A hydrophilic surface allows the formation of high-quality perovskite thin films, and the induced dipole by interlayer reduces the energy barrier between the CTL and the perovskite emitter for ohmic charge injection into the conduction band of the perovskites8,21,63–65 (Fig. 5). Wang et al. fabricated conventional PeLEDs by incorporating a multifunctional polyethyleneimine (PEI) interlayer between the oxide electron transporting layer and the perovskite emissive layer.21 The PEI interlayer on top of ZnO played an important role in enhancing the perovskite film quality during solution processing. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the contact angle of water on the ZnO layer decreased from 53° to 27° after the PEI treatment, indicating that the ZnO surface transformed to a highly hydrophilic surface. The improved surface wetting property of the ZnO layer helped suppress the dewetting of the deposited perovskite films during thermal annealing.60,66 As a result, high-quality perovskite films with excellent crystalline characteristics, long PL lifetimes, and good surface coverage (see Fig. 5d) were fabricated by applying the PEI treatment to the ZnO layer. Furthermore, the work function of ZnO was reduced from 3.7 to 3.2 eV after modification using a thin layer of PEI, and it facilitated the ohmic electron injection into the perovskite layers. Thus, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx-based near-infrared (NIR) PeLEDs were fabricated with an EQEmax of 3.5% and a high radiance of 28 W sr−1 m−2. Recently, Sun et al. proposed a strategy to modify the interface between the hole transport layer (HTL) and the perovskite layer using an amphiphilic conjugated polymer (poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN)).62 The amphiphilic conjugated polymer was used to convert the surface of the HTL from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, and a high-quality perovskite film with a uniform surface was obtained. This helped fabricate a highly efficient PeLED with an EQEmax of 14.4%.

Yu et al. fabricated highly efficient planar PeLEDs and PeSCs using an amine-based solvent treatment on top of compact TiO2 (c-TiO2).64 An ethanolamine (EA)-based solvent treatment on TiO2 would facilitate the uniform growth of the perovskite crystal on the TiO2 layer by reducing the defect sites of TiO2, and a substantially denser CH3NH3PbBr3 film surface with fewer pinholes was obtained. Moreover, an EA as a surface modifier induced an interfacial dipole layer to reduce the contact barrier at the interface of c-TiO2 and the perovskite absorber or emissive layer. The optimised CH3NH3PbBr3 LEDs with reduced contact barrier and enhanced electron injection exhibited a maximum luminance of 544.65 cd m−2 and an EQEmax of 0.051%. To obtain uniform and low defect density CH3NH3PbBr3 films, Wang et al. introduced amino acid monomolecular layers with different alkyl chains (5-ammoniumvaleric acid (5-AVA) or 8-aminooctanoic acid (8AOA)) between ZnO and the CH3NH3PbBr3 film.63 Amino acid can be introduced on the ZnO surface by forming covalent bonds between the carboxyl groups and the ZnO ions,67,68 and hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions between the amino groups and the perovskites framework can facilitate the nucleation of CH3NH3PbBr3 crystals. The improved morphology of the perovskite films on amino acid-modified ZnO can help effectively enhance the PeLED performance. The device on 5-AVA-treated ZnO layer exhibited an EQEmax of 0.43% and a maximum luminance of ∼5000 cd m−2.
One of the main losses in efficiency is due to the light trapping in PeLEDs because the refractive index of perovskite materials is much higher than that of organic materials. Therefore, Friend and co-workers proposed the use of a textured perovskite layer to reduce the amount of light escaping in the active layer, thereby increasing the PLQY.69 Recently, Huang and co-workers reported that the perovskite precursor containing 5-AVA was spin-coated on a polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE)-coated ZnO substrate, forming non-uniform submicrometric-scale structures, which could efficiently extract light in PeLEDs.14 Moreover, the device performance of PeLED was improved despite the presence of discontinuous perovskite films because 5-AVA additives could passivate the perovskite defects and reduce the shunt pathway, and the corresponding PeLEDs exhibited a significantly high EQEmax of 20.7%. This result suggests that proper interface engineering can realize a high efficiency PeLED despite the existence of non-uniform morphology of the perovskite film.
5. Quasi-2D perovskite
5.1. Energy funnelling in mixed-phase quasi-2D perovskite
Generally, perovskite materials exhibit exciton binding energies as low as 50 meV. This reduces the radiative recombination rate within the perovskite grains. To solve this problem, a 2D perovskite film (n = 1; where n is the number of layers) with a high exciton binding energy was introduced for LED application. However, the 2D perovskite film exhibited electroluminescence only under 200 K because of the high scattering rate of the phonons.70,71 Recently, Yuan et al. reported dimensionally tuned multi-layered quasi-2D perovskites (n = 2–5) by incorporating a bulky cation (phenylethylammonium, PEA) for highly efficient PeLEDs.25 Although the ratio of phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) to methylammonium iodide (MAI) was determined for specific number of layers, the perovskite film fabricated using the simple spin casting method contained various phases with different n values. The mixed-phase quasi-2D perovskite films with different band gaps exhibit an energy funnelled structure, thereby increasing the carrier density of phases with high n values, as shown in Fig. 6c. These self-organized multiple quantum wells increase carrier confinement, a high radiative recombination rate was achieved, with an EQEmax of 8.8% at near-infrared wavelengths.25 In addition, Wang et al. reported highly efficient PeLEDs with EQEs of 11.7% and 8.8% at near-infrared and green emission, respectively, using the same strategies but with different bulky ligand materials (1-naphthylmethylamine, NMA).26

5.2. Morphology control of quasi-2D perovskite
Since the first demonstration of quasi-2D PeLEDs by Sargent et al.,25 many studies have further improved the efficiency of quasi-2D PeLEDs. In particular, many efforts have been made to improve the morphology of quasi-2D perovskite films. Quan et al. reported energy landscape engineering for an efficient energy transfer to lower bandgap domains.72 The efficient energy landscape was assessed using a Monte Carlo model simulation. An optimised energy landscape for energy transfer is realised using different anti-solvents, as shown in Fig. 7a–c. The quasi-2D perovskite film obtained using chloroform as an anti-solvent showed a broader bandgap distribution with small clusters, compared to that obtained using toluene. The boiling point of chloroform (61 °C) is lower than that of toluene (110 °C), and the low boiling point helps crystallise perovskite faster, resulting in a more distributed energy landscape. Finally, the optimised energy landscape-based quasi-2D PeLEDs showed an EQEmax of 7.4% corresponding to green emission.

Ng et al. optimised the morphology of quasi-2D CsPbBr3 perovskites by changing the amount of phenylethylammonium bromide (PEABr) added to the perovskite precursor solutions.11 The precursor solutions were prepared with different molar ratios (PEABr:CsPbBr3 = 0:1, 0.05:1, 0.1:1, 0.2:1, 0.3:1, 0.5:1, 0.8:1, and 1:1). Before the addition of PEABr into the precursor solutions, the CsPbBr3 perovskites films exhibited large grains and pinholes. With the increase in the amount of PEABr added to the perovskite precursor solutions, the grain size decreases, and no pinholes are observed in the morphology, as shown in Fig. 7d–f. Finally, they optimised the optical and electrical properties of quasi-2D CsPbBr3 films with a PEABr:CsPbBr3 ratio of 0.8:1. The improvements made to the morphology helped significantly improve the efficiency of LED devices, obtaining an EQE of 1.97%.
Yang et al. improved the morphology and enhanced the optical properties by adding methylammonium chloride (MACl) to a quasi-2D perovskite precursor solution.73 The perovskite crystallisation rate is reduced, and the film morphology is improved with the addition of MACl, as shown in Fig. 7g and h. Moreover, a small amount of residual Cl passivated the grain boundary, though MACl largely evaporated during the annealing process conducted at 90 °C for 1 h. With the combined effect of morphological control (via adding MACl to the perovskite precursor solution) and surface passivation of the top surface of perovskite using trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), the obtained quasi-2D PeLEDs exhibited a current efficiency of 62.4 cd A−1 and an EQEmax of 14.36% corresponding to green emission.
6. Conclusions
We summarised the recent progress in the morphological control of perovskite films used in high performance and stable PeLEDs. The morphological control of perovskite films is a simple and effective method for achieving high performance and stable PeLEDs. A uniform pinhole-free morphology of a perovskite film with small grain size can realize high-performance PeLEDs. This film can be achieved by optimizing the deposition method in terms of the solvent, temperature, interfacial engineering, and additive used. However, a low binding energy of perovskite is a drawback; thus, a quasi-2D perovskite film demonstrating the energy funnelling effect is required to achieve highly efficient PeLEDs. We expect that the EQE of PeLEDs will eventually increase up to 30% through the further improvement in PLQE of quasi-2D perovskite emitters up to 100% using the additive-assisted method with small grain size, and enhancement in outcoupling efficiency by controlling the perovskite surface. Moreover, such PeLEDs would open new avenues toward the realisation of optically or electrically pumped perovskite lasing applications. Theoretical calculations can significantly contribute to further advances in the design of morphological techniques, even though they cannot be performed regularly in the field of morphological control of perovskite films.
