    , Accepted 18th June 2019First published on 18th June 2019AbstractLow-dimensional organic–inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) have received intense interest largely due to their remarkable stability compared to their 3D counterparts for potential optoelectronic and photovoltaic (PV) applications. However, 2D OIHPs encounter a ‘bottleneck’ of ultra-low conductivity between the inorganic sheets, owing to the intrinsic quantum and dielectric confinements, which usually results in unsatisfactory device performance. Herein, we predict and design a new family of 2D OIHPs to break the charge-transport ‘bottleneck’. The newly designed 2D OIHPs consist of π-conjugated organic species as the spacers. As such, we find that the electronic structures exhibit type-II band alignment (staggered bandgap). Such a band-structure feature by design, if confirmed in the laboratory, re-enforces a materials design strategy for enhancing optoelectronic or PV device performance with 2D OIHPs.
Introduction
State-of-the-art polycrystalline thin-film perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.2%.1 This is the fastest rise in PCE among any class of photovoltaic absorber materials.2 Highly cost-effective PSCs with high PCE strongly imply that next-generation high performance semiconductors are halide perovskites.3–11 However, the large-scale application of OIHP-based PSCs is still hampered by the instability and toxicity issues due to the containing of hygroscopic organic (e.g., methylammonium (MA+) or formamidinium (FA+)) and lead (Pb) cations.12 To address both issues, extensive research effort has been devoted to seeking highly stable and lead-free perovskites for PVs.13–21 Recently, low-dimensional OIHPs have received intense attention owing to their robust ambient stability.22–31 Among low-dimensional OIHPs, 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskites have been extensively studied since relatively high PV performance can be achieved by controlling the crystallographic anisotropy in thin films.32 Indeed, the associated devices have yielded a PCE of 14%.33,34 However, 2D RP OIHPs are still based on a toxic element, lead, while the PCE is still notably lower than that of 3D OIHPs. Another known type of 2D OIHP, namely, the Dion–Jacobson (DJ) phase, has also been synthesized35 recently, and the associated devices based on DJ tin halide perovskites have yielded a PCE of 4.22%.36
Note that 2D OIHPs are essentially quantum-well structures formed by n blocks of inorganic [PbI6]4− octahedral slabs, each slab being separated by bulky organic cations such as monoammonium cations in the RP phase and diammonium cations in the DJ phase. Most 2D OIHPs exhibit the type-I electronic band alignment of the organic and inorganic frameworks.37–40 Because of their quantum-well structures, 2D OIHPs typically exhibit strong effects of quantum confinement and dielectric confinement. As a result, the charges are generally confined in the inorganic framework, and the exciton binding energies can be many times greater than kT at room temperature (k is the Boltzmann constant and T is temperature). Both physical features are undesirable for PV devices.41 Moreover, the optical bandgaps of 2D OIHPs are wider than those of 3D counterparts. It is known that both strong light absorption in the visible range and the easy separation of electron–hole pairs are important requirements for high performance PV devices. In most 2D OHIPs, excitons tend to recombine rather than dissociate into free electrons and holes. Nevertheless, we propose that 2D OIHPs with type-II band alignment can significantly facilitate the separation of excitons to overcome the limitations of prevailing 2D OIHPs with type-I band alignment. To our knowledge, only a few type-II compounds have been reported.42,43
In general, the “organic” component in 2D OIHPs possesses a smaller dielectric constant than the inorganic component, resulting in type-I band alignment. To design 2D OHIPs with the type-II band alignment, an “organic” component with a higher dielectric constant is required. Recently, Liu et al. proposed to tune the optoelectronic properties by changing specific organic functional groups.44 It is known that organic semiconductors composed of π-conjugated molecules possess higher dielectric constants, which can lead to higher carrier mobility. Most of these π-conjugated molecules are commercially available at low cost, such as oligoacenes and oligothiophenes.45,46 With these prototypical π-conjugated molecules, the corresponding cations can be obtained by chemical modification. Herein, we report a series of 2D lead-free OIHPs, (π-DAM)(FA)n−1SnnX3n+1 (n = 1–4), where π-DAM refers to an organic diammonium cation with a π-conjugated molecular structure [i.e., 2,6-anthracenediyldimethanammonium (AMA), 2,8-tetracenediyldimethanammonium (TMA), 2,9-pentacenediyldimethanammonium (PMA), 2,10-hexacenediyldimethanammonium (HMA), or anthra[2,3-b:7,8-b′]bis(5-thiopheneylmethanammonium) (ATMA)]. Here, X refers to a halogen anion (i.e., I, Br or Cl). Based on DFT computations, we systematically investigate these 2D compounds. By introducing different π-DAMs, we can effectively alter the optoelectronic properties of 2D OIHPs to achieve the type-II band alignment, thereby facilitating separation of electron–hole pairs to enhance carrier mobility.
Results and discussion
In this study, we focus on 2D DJ OIHPs. Fig. 1A shows the organic molecular structures of the five π-DAMs considered. All the π-DAMs are derivatives of oligoacenes which are widely studied molecular semiconductors. For oligoacenes, particular attention is placed on pentacene and tetracene due to their high carrier mobility. The main building blocks of oligoacenes (anthracene, tetracene, pentacene and hexacene) are benzene rings (ranging from 3 to 6), all connected in a planar fashion except anthra[2,3-b:7,8-b′]dithiophene which may be viewed as a variant of pentacene. For the latter, two benzenes located at both ends of pentacene are substituted by thiophenes. ESI Fig. S1† shows the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the five π-DAMs considered. The energy level of the HOMO increases rapidly with the increase of the number of benzene rings, while that of the LUMO increases slowly, resulting in a gradually narrowed bandgap with the increase of the number of benzene rings. Moreover, the energy level of the ATMA HOMO is located between that of PMA and HMA, while the energy level of the ATMA LUMO is between that of TMA and PMA, suggesting two strategies to alter the electronic properties of π-DAMs: (1) changing the number of benzene rings, and (2) substituting benzene with another aromatic cycle, like thiophene. The different frontier energy levels of π-DAMs imply that the band alignment of 2D OIHPs may be altered by introducing different π-DAMs. Fig. 1B displays the computed optical absorption spectra with different π-DAMs. Clearly, all π-DAMs yield suitable optical absorption in the visible range, desired for PV applications.

For 2D OIHPs, four different band alignments (type-Ia, type-Ib, type-IIa, and type-IIb) are possible (see Fig. S2†). Type-I band alignment is not beneficial for PV applications. Fig. 2A shows the crystal structures of 2D DJ OIHPs. It can be seen that π-DAMs with a tilt angle are embedded between inorganic scaffolds (more structural details are given in Fig. S3†). First, we consider the compounds with the formula (π-DAM)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 1–4). With different π-DAMs, the electronic properties of these compounds are computed, including their frontier energy levels and bandgaps, based on the PBE0 functional. The frontier energy levels of “organic” and “inorganic” components with different inorganic layers (n = 1–4) are displayed in Fig. 2B–F. Clearly, compounds with the formula (AMA)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 1–4) possess the type-Ib band alignment of organic and inorganic frameworks due to the high LUMO energy level and low HOMO energy level of AMA. Interestingly, when TMA is introduced into the 2D OIHPs, the band alignment of the compounds with the formula (TMA)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 1–4) is converted from type-Ia to type-IIa, with the increase of the number of “inorganic” layers (see Fig. 2C). For compounds with (PMA)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 1–4), again, the band alignment is converted from type-Ia to type-IIa. The difference between (TMA)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 and (PMA)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 is that at n = 2, the band alignment has already changed to type-IIa for the forme, whereas for the latter at n = 3, the band alignment has changed to type-IIa. All compounds with the formula (HMA)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 1–4) possess the type-Ia band alignment due to the low LUMO energy level and high HOMO energy level of HMA.
 Fig. 2  Crystalline structures of 2D OIHPs (π-DAMs)(FA)n−1SnnX3n+1 viewed from the front (left panels) and side (right panels) (A). Computed frontier energy levels of “organic” and “inorganic” components of (π-DAM)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 1–4), π-DAM = AMA (B), TMA (C), PMA (D), HMA (E) and ATMA (F), based on the PBE0 functional. The computed HOMO of “organic” components is treated as the reference energy. 
As aforementioned, ATMA possesses similar electronic properties to TMA and PMA. For compounds with the formula (ATMA)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 1–4), at n = 2, the band alignment changes to type-IIa with the increase of the number of layers. Interestingly, the band alignment of compound (ATMA)SnI4 belongs to type-IIb. Based on our analysis, four band alignments are possible in the newly designed compounds. These account for different band alignments for 2D OIHPs through altering the organic cations and the number of layers of inorganic scaffolds. In addition, for all the compounds, the frontier energy levels of “inorganic” components gradually increase with the increase of the number of layers with respect to the corresponding “organic” components. Meanwhile, the bandgap of “organic” component exhibits little change with the increase of the number of layers, indicating that the thickness of inorganic scaffolds has little effect on the organic cations. In contrast, the bandgap of the “inorganic” component gradually decreases with the increase of the number of layers.
Next, if iodine in the compounds is substituted by another halogen element (e.g., Br and Cl), the electronic properties of inorganic scaffolds would be significantly modified. Fig. S4A–E and S5A–E† show the frontier energy levels of (π-DAM)(FA)n−1SnnBr3n+1 (n = 1–4) and (π-DAM)(FA)n−1SnnCl3n+1 (n = 1–4), respectively. It can be seen that bromide and chloride result in wider bandgaps for the “inorganic” component. Due to the relatively high energy level of the CBM and relatively low energy level of the VBM, most compounds possess the type-Ia band alignment except (AMA)(FA)n−1SnnBr3n+1 (n = 2–4) and (AMA)(FA)n−1SnnCl3n+1 (n = 3–4), which possess the type-IIa band alignment. In addition, the electronic properties of the “inorganic bromide” component and “inorganic chloride” component exhibit similar trends as iodide. For example, the frontier energy levels of the “inorganic” component gradually increase with the increase of the number of layers with respect to the corresponding “organic” components. Due to the stronger interaction between “organic” and “inorganic” components, the bandgap of the “organic” component associated with bromide and chloride is narrower than that associated with iodide, a manifestation of the stronger electronegativity of bromine and chloride ions.
Compounds with the formula (TMA)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 2–4), (PMA)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 3–4), (ATMA)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 1–4), (AMA)(FA)n−1SnnBr3n+1 (n = 2–4), and (AMA)(FA)n−1SnnCl3n+1 (n = 3–4) all possess the type-II band alignment, which is potentially beneficial for PV applications. ESI Fig. S6–S10† show the total density of states (TDOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) of these compounds. The HOMO and LUMO of the “organic” component are mainly contributed by the π-conjugation of π-DAMs. The CBM of the “inorganic” component is mostly contributed by the Sn p orbital while the VBM of the “inorganic” component is mostly contributed by the halogen s orbital and Sn p orbital, similar to 3D tin halide perovskites. As pointed out above, the energy levels of the VBM and CBM of the “inorganic” component shift significantly, with respect to the HOMO and LUMO of the “organic” component, with the increase of the number of layers. Fig. S11† shows the charge density distribution corresponding to the CB and VB around the band edge for compounds (PMA)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 1–4). Clearly, for n = 1 and 2, the VBM and CBM that exhibit π-conjugated orbitals are localized on PMA, confirming that (PMA)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2) possesses the type-Ia band alignment. For n = 3, the VBM is delocalized on both “inorganic” and “organic” components, and the CBM is localized on the “organic” component, demonstrating that there is a transition of band alignment from type-Ia to type-IIa. For n = 4, (PMA)(FA)3Sn4I13 possesses the type-IIa band alignment, while the VBM with the characters of the Sn s orbital and I p orbital is localized on the “inorganic” component, and the CBM with the characters of π-conjugated orbitals is localized on the “organic” component.
As pointed out above, compounds possessing the type-II band alignment are expected to facilitate the separation of hole–electron pairs (see Fig. 3A), which may improve the performance of the PV device. Considering 2D OIHPs as a light absorber, the increase of the number of layers of the “inorganic” component seems beneficial for light absorption in the visible region. For n = 4, stronger light absorption in the visible range is very likely for compounds (TMA)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1, (PMA)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 and (ATMA)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1. Meanwhile, (AMA)(FA)3Sn4Br13 and (ATMA)(FA)3Sn4Cl13 possess a wider bandgap (>2.5 eV and 3.0 eV, respectively), unsuitable for the light absorption in the visible region. Hereafter, we mainly focus on the three newly designed compounds, (TMA)(FA)3Sn4I13, (PMA)(FA)3Sn4I13 and (ATMA)(FA)3Sn4I13. To gain deeper insight into the effect of π-DAMs on band alignment, we compute the band structures of (TMA)(FA)3Sn4I13, (PMA)(FA)3Sn4I13 and (ATMA)(FA)3Sn4I13 compounds, respectively. Fig. 3C,D show the band structures of (TMA)(FA)3Sn4I13, (PMA)(FA)3Sn4I13 and (ATMA)(FA)3Sn4I13. The states of π-DAMs are identified with orange color. The K path in the reciprocal space is shown in Fig. 3B. One can see that all three compounds exhibit similar contour features of the band structures, and all exhibit a direct bandgap at the Z point due to the similar properties of the three diammoniums (TMA, PMA and ATMA). By changing the π-DAM, the dispersive bands due to the “organic” component shift with respect to those due to the “inorganic” component, consistent with the feature illustrated in PDOS. In contrast, the “inorganic” component derived band exhibits little change for the three compounds.

(F) Computed optical absorption spectra (based on the PBE0 functional) of (TMA)(FA)3Sn4I13, (PMA)(FA)3Sn4I13 and (ATMA)(FA)3Sn4I13 (‖: parallel to xy; ⊥: perpendicular to the xy plane). 
The electronic properties of the three compounds, which possess both features of organic semiconductors and inorganic tin halide perovskites, can be viewed as a combination of those of 2D tin perovskites and oligoacenes. In addition, we computed the optoelectronic properties of 2D tin perovskite ((MA)2(FA)3Sn4I13), 2D tetracene, 2D pentacene, and 2D anthra[2,3-b:7,8-b′]dithiophene (see ESI Fig. S12† for more details). ESI Fig. S13–S16† show the computed optoelectronic properties of the four 2D materials, including the band structures, PDOS, and optical absorption spectra (‖: parallel to xy; ⊥: perpendicular to the xy plane). All four 2D materials exhibit direct bandgaps at the Γ point. The band structures and PDOS of (MA)2(FA)3Sn4I13 exhibit similar characters to 3D tin perovskites, except the wider bandgap. The light absorption in the “‖” direction is slightly stronger than that in the “⊥” direction in the visible range. Other three “organic” 2D materials exhibit similar band structures and PDOS due to their similar π-conjugated structure and arrangement of molecules. The three “organic” 2D materials also exhibit strong light absorption in the visible region; while the “‖” light absorption is stronger than the “⊥” one in the visible region due to the orientation of molecules.
In view of different optical absorption regions for the organic and inorganic component, a suitable mix of the inorganic and organic 2D materials can enable absorption of solar light in a wider region (e.g., from ultraviolet or infrared) to enhance the performance of PV. Akin to the principle underlying tandem solar cells, when crystal orientations of organic and inorganic components in 2D OIHPs are perpendicular to the substrate, the PV device can be viewed as parallel stacking of a series of solar cells. Because of strong light absorption in the visible region for the “inorganic” and “organic” components, (TMA)(FA)3Sn4I13, (PMA)(FA)3Sn4I13 and (ATMA)(FA)3Sn4I13 exhibit stronger absorption in the visible region (see Fig. 3F), which may be beneficial for the performance of PV. Analogous to the corresponding 2D material, the “‖” light absorption is also stronger than “⊥” in the visible range.
For OIHPs containing the tin element, the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) can moderately reduce the bandgap. Fig. S17† shows the computed DOS of (TMA)(FA)3Sn4I13, (PMA)(FA)3Sn4I13 and (ATMA)(FA)3Sn4I13, based on the PBE0 functional with considering the SOC effect. Clearly, the states of the “organic” component are little affected by the SOC. In stark contrast, the CBM of the “inorganic” component shifts to a lower energy level by about 0.25 eV, compared to that without considering SOC. This is because the CBM is mostly contributed by Sn p orbitals. Still, the three compounds considered maintain the type-IIb band alignment. Moreover, we perform ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations to examine the thermal stabilities of the three compounds at 300 K (see Fig. S18†). It can be seen that these 2D perovskite frameworks are well sustained during the AIMD simulation, suggesting that these compounds are likely to be thermally stable at room temperature.
Carrier mobility is another important property for PV performance assessment. The “inorganic” component of 2D tin OHIPs exhibits relatively high carrier mobility. For example, PEA2SnI4 (PEA = C6H5C2H4NH3+) exhibits a hole mobility as high as 26 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 4.6 cm2 V−1 s−1.47,48 Due to the band offset between the conduction and valence band of “inorganic” and “organic” components, electrons and holes are promoted to transfer between “inorganic” and “organic” components, respectively. For newly designed compounds, it would be desirable that the “organic” component also possesses relatively high carrier mobility. Note that due to the symmetry of 2D OIHPs and the π-DAMs, there is only a weak dipole interaction between the ammoniums and iodine ions. The main π-conjugated structures of π-DAMs are not strongly affected by the “inorganic” component, retaining similar optoelectronic properties of π-DAMs to the corresponding organic molecules. As such, we can use the Marcus theory to assess the charge carrier mobility of the three π-DAMs. The computed reorganization energies for electron and hole transfer are listed in Table S1.† For π-conjugated cations which are electron-rich systems, the negative polaronic state exhibits stronger deformation than the positive polaronic state, resulting in higher reorganization energy. The electronic couplings based on the two different charge hopping channels (see Fig. 4) are listed in Tables S2–S4.† One can see that the electronic couplings for electron transfer are slightly weaker than those for hole transfer. The computed electron mobility is 0.51, 2.06 and 0.23 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TMA, PMA and ATMA, respectively, while the computed hole mobility is 5.24, 6.25 and 5.42 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TMA, PMA and ATMA, respectively. The electron mobility is slightly lower than the hole mobility, consistent with a previous report.46 The charge carrier mobilities are also much higher than those of other organic cations used in 2D OIHPs due to strong overlap between the π–π stacking of molecular structures. The carrier mobility of the “organic” component is comparable to that of amorphous silicon (0.5–1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1), indicating that the three compounds would likely exhibit high carrier mobility. This accounts for two parallel high-speed channels for hole and electron transfer, respectively. In addition, we have computed the carrier mobility of the corresponding 2D organic materials (tetracene, pentacene and anthra[2,3-b:7,8-b′]dithiophene). Due to the smaller reorganization energies of organic molecules (with respect to inorganic counterparts), all three 2D organic materials are predicted to exhibit higher carrier mobility than π-DAMs (see Tables S5–S8†). Although the carrier mobility of π-DAMs exhibits a decline, the π-DAMs still retain the main feature of carrier mobility. So it is sensible to pre-estimate the properties of charge transfer of the “organic” component for 2D OIHPs via computing the carrier mobility of corresponding organic molecules.

Lastly, we note that 2D perovskites containing large aromatic organic components (oligothiophenes and divalent benzodiimidazolium) have already been synthesized in previous experiments.42,43,49 Very recently, a 2D DJ perovskite solar cell based on benzene dimethylammonium cations has achieved a PCE of 15.6%.50 We expect that more 2D DJ perovskites based on larger aromatic (like AMA, TMA, PMA, etc.) diammonium will be synthesized in the near future. To fabricate the PV device based on 2D DJ perovskites with larger aromatic diammonium, it is important to synthesize the film of 2D DJ OIHPs. In a previous study,32 2D OIHP thin films were fabricated by using a hot-casting technique. Through this synthesis route, the inorganic and organic sheet orientations in 2D OIHPs are both perpendicular to the substrate in thin films (see Fig. S19†). The band offset between the conduction band and valence band can lead to separation of electrons and holes between the organic and inorganic sheets, and to the suppression of electron/hole recombination, thereby enhancing the performance of the PV device.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have investigated a series of 2D lead-free OIHPs, (diammonium)(FA)n−1SnnX3n+1 (n = 1–4), as potentially high-performance light absorbers for PV applications. By carefully choosing appropriate organic functional cations, the 2D compounds can possess different band alignments (among type-Ia, -Ib, -IIa and -IIb) by design. The optoelectronic properties are also tunable, by using different functionalization approaches, such as changing the halogen atom, π-conjugated diammonium, and layers of the “inorganic” component. More specifically, we identify three compounds, (TMA)(FA)3Sn4I13, (PMA)(FA)3Sn4I13 and (ATMA)(FA)3Sn4I13, to possess type-II band alignment and high carrier mobility in their “organic and inorganic” components. Considering that both visible-light absorption and carrier mobilities are two key properties of solar cell absorbers, we predict that the newly predicted three compounds are promising candidates to yield reasonably high performance and can also address both stability and lead-toxicity issues elucidated in the introduction for future PV applications.

 	Fig. 1  (A) Molecular structures of selected π-DAMs considered in the study. (B) Computed optical absorption spectra of π-DAMs by using the TD-DFT method.	 

 	Fig. 2  Crystalline structures of 2D OIHPs (π-DAMs)(FA)n−1SnnX3n+1 viewed from the front (left panels) and side (right panels) (A). Computed frontier energy levels of “organic” and “inorganic” components of (π-DAM)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 1–4), π-DAM = AMA (B), TMA (C), PMA (D), HMA (E) and ATMA (F), based on the PBE0 functional. The computed HOMO of “organic” components is treated as the reference energy.	 

 	Fig. 3  (A) A schematic plot to show mechanism of charge transfer in 2D OIHPs with type-II band alignment. The photogenerated exciton will be separated to hole (h) and electron (e) on organic spacer (denoted by black spindles) and metal halide sheets (diamonds), respectively. (B) The K path in the reciprocal space. (C–E) Computed band structures (based on PBE0 functional) of (TMA)(FA)3Sn4I13 (C), (PMA)(FA)3Sn4I13 (D) and (ATMA)(FA)3Sn4I13 (E). The projected states of π-DAMs are identified with orange color. (F) Computed optical absorption spectra (based on the PBE0 functional) of (TMA)(FA)3Sn4I13, (PMA)(FA)3Sn4I13 and (ATMA)(FA)3Sn4I13 (‖: parallel to xy; ⊥: perpendicular to the xy plane).	 

 	Fig. 4  Schematic of charge carrier hopping channels for calculating the charge carrier mobility of TMA, PMA and ATMA. The π–π stacking of π-DAMs could facilitate charge transfer.
