    , Accepted 25th June 2020First published on 26th June 2020AbstractSystematic and strong rare-earth photoluminescence (PL) color flips that are highly sensitive to structural phase transformation in KLaF4:RE3+ (RE3+ = Eu3+, Er3+/Yb3+) nanocrystals are demonstrated. Room-temperature wet chemical synthesis at various reaction times involves a systematic conversion from cubic (α, space group Fmm) to hexagonal (β, space group P2m) polymorph nanocrystals of 4 to 8 nm sizes. The unusual down-conversion photoluminescence (DC-PL) asymmetric ratio of the hypersensitive transition (5D0 → 7F2, Red) to that of nearly invariant transition (5D0 → 7F1, Orange) (R/O from 1.2 to 3.0) of KLaF4:Eu3+ is substantially affected by the site-selective occupancy and local symmetry around the Eu3+ ions, according to crystal packing transformation. The NIR excited up-conversion photoluminescence (UC-PL) of Er3+ ions produces a strong color flip from green (2H11/2 and 4S3/2) to red (4F9/2) dominated emissions based on their cubic or hexagonal crystal packing. The site occupancy and phonon energies strongly influence various nonlinear energy transfer mechanisms within RE3+ ion energies and the results are explained accordingly. The present study substantially reveals the local host effects and these two distinct polymorph nanoparticles can be potentially utilized for color-specific studies related to applications such as color-specific biological in vitro and in vivo imaging and other optoelectronic device applications.
Introduction
The excellent luminescence properties of rare-earth (RE3+) ion doped fluoride ALnF4:RE3+ nanoparticles are widely exploited in optical devices such as solar cells, flat-panel 3D displays, and solid-state lasers and in biomedical applications e.g. in vitro and in vivo bioimaging and drug delivery systems.1–4 Some unique and attractive features of RE3+ ion doped fluoride nanocrystals include the conversion ability of NIR excitation into visible emission (up-conversion), high photochemical stability with low hygroscopic properties and excellent dispersibility in solvents, low phonon energy, high optical transparency in the visible-NIR region, low background and low toxicity.5,6 Due to their significant optical transparency and rare-earth doping capabilities, they are well-established as rare-earth doped nanophosphors and widely used in color conversion coating, in vitro and in vivo bioimaging and spectroscopic applications.7,8 While rare-earth optical properties are almost invariant with the host matrix, ALnF4:RE3+ nanocrystals showed a wide range of emission properties based on the rare-earth site occupancy and crystal packing of the host.
A broad variety of fluoride nanocrystalline materials, such as LaF3, MF2, ALnF4, M2LnF7 and MLnF5; M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Cd, and Pb; A = Na, K; Ln = rare-earth metals, show a wide range of crystal phases.9–12 Phase transformation can be achieved by changing synthesis parameters such as F:Ln3+ ratio, temperature, reaction time, high and low induced pressure and doping of transition metals and rare-earth ions.13–15 Different types of crystal structures such as cubic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, and hexagonal of NaYF4 fluoride systems have been reported.16–18 The fluoride system of KLaF4 nanocrystals is realized in two prominent polymorphs: the cubic phase [Fmm, (no. 255), α-KLaF4] and the hexagonal phase [P2m, Z = 1, (no. 189), β-KLaF4] fabricated at different temperatures.19–21 Similarly, NaYF4 also exists in two polymorphs, one in a thermodynamically unstable fluoride structure (cubic, Fmm, no. 225, Z = 4) in which the occupation of Na+ and Y3+ is random in the cationic site. The other polymorph which is hexagonal, can be derived from three structural models from P, Z = 1, (no. 174), P2m, Z = 1, (no. 189) and P63m, Z = 1, (no. 176) space groups.16,17 In the lattice of space group P2m, Z = 1, formula Na1.5Y1.5F6, there are three cationic sites: the 1a site is occupied by Y3+, the 2d site is shared by Na+ and Y3+ in a 3:1 ratio, and F− ions are populated in two different crystallographic sites-3f and 3g.22
It is essential to explore how the morphological and optical properties change with a change in the crystal phase and local structure of the host lattice. The emission efficiency and color tunability are two critical factors for the application of up-conversion materials in biomedical and industrial processes. Er3+ (activator) doping in the ALnF4 host converts efficiently near-infrared excitation light into green and red emission bands due to its rich energy level structure with an equal spacing and long-lived population efficiency of transition levels. Yb3+ acts as a sensitizer in up-conversion materials and transfers energy to the activators because it absorbs excitation energy due to its strong absorption properties. Eu3+ is a very well-known spectroscopic agent due to its site occupancy and symmetry breakdown features. Liu et al. reported that the annealing of β-NaLuF4:Gd, Yb, and Er submicron particles at high temperatures introduces structural changes and emission colors.23 Several synthesis strategies have been reported to achieve single red emission using Mn2+ or Ce3+ doping into NaLnF4:RE3+ by assisted energy transfer from RE3+ to Mn2+ or Ce3+.24,25 The structural sensitivity to emission intensities from the experiments based on the heat treatment, reaction time, chemical stoichiometry, presence of salts etc. has also been reported.26–28
However, to date, several crystal phase polymorphs have been reported in ALnF4 type systems, exclusively to point out the structural features. RE3+ ions are known to be sensitive to the site selective occupancy and crystal field effects. For example, Eu3+ is known to be a structural probe and shows either red (5D0 → 7F2) or orange (5D0 → 7F1) dominance, depending on its site selectivity.29,30 Similarly, Er3+ ions show potential upconversion emission upon NIR excitation, either in red or green color due to various host lattice influenced energy transfer pathways.31–33 Thus, the study of RE3+ ion emission characteristics substantially reveals the local host effects and a distinctly different energy transfer mechanism and the effect of crystal polymorphs can be potentially utilized for color-specific studies related to applications such as color-specific biological in vitro and in vivo imaging and other optoelectronic device applications. As such, until now, there were no such reports on the systematic understanding of phase flip induced optical features within a single lattice. Here, we report the systematic synthesis and reaction time-dependent structural phase flips from the cubic (Fm3m, no. 225, Z = 4, α-KLaF4) to hexagonal phase (P2m, (no. 189) Z = 1, β-KLaF4) of KLaF4 nanocrystals doped with RE3+ (Eu3+ and Er3+/Yb3+) and their unusual photoluminescence characteristics.
Experimental section
KLaF4 nanoparticles were synthesized by a one-step wet chemical route. In a typical reaction, 20 ml of a methanolic solution of 0.4362 g, (1 mmol) of La(acac)3·xH2O (Sigma Aldrich 99.0%) was added drop-wise to the KF (0.2324 g, 4 mmol) solution under continuous stirring at room temperature. Then, the reaction temperature was maintained at 65 °C for various reaction times (2, 4, 8, 10, 12 and 14 h). Finally, the solution was allowed to cool to room temperature. The resultant precipitate was isolated by centrifugation at 8000 rpm after washing several times with methanol and dried overnight in a vacuum oven. For the doping of rare-earth ions, 5 mol% of Eu(acac)3, 0.5 mol% of Er(acac)3 and 20 mol% of Yb(acac)3 were prepared from EuCl3·6H2O (Sigma Aldrich 99.0%), ErCl3·6H2O (Sigma Aldrich 99.0%), and YbCl3·6H2O (Sigma Aldrich 99.0%), respectively, and were added dropwise to the La(acac)3·xH2O and KF solutions.34 All chemicals were used without any further purification.
Characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded by using a Philips X'Pert Pro diffractometer with a point detector in the Bragg–Brentano geometry employing Cu Kα radiation (α = 1.54060 Å) and a power of 45 kV–40 mA. Data points were collected from 10 to 80° after calibrating the instrument using the Si standard externally. The Rietveld refinement of the powder XRD data was carried out using the GSAS® software based on the available structural data. HRTEM images were obtained using a FEI Tecnai TF20 microscope equipped with a field emission gun source, operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The sample for TEM was prepared by dropping 1 μL of a diluted nanoparticle suspension prepared in ethanol on a carbon-coated grid and allowed to dry in a vacuum. The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the synthesized samples were collected using a PerkinElmer Lambda-35 UV-visible spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere attached, using BaSO4 as the reference. The up-conversion and down-conversion emissions were recorded using a custom-built setup that consists of a 980 nm, 1 W diode laser, 405 nm, 155 mW diode laser, and monochromator-Acton SP 2300 coupled to a photomultiplier tube (calibrated with mercury emission).
Results and discussion
Systematic evolution of the structural and photoluminescence properties in the Eu3+ doped KLaF4 nanocrystals

(a) Structural and morphological characterization. 
The crystallinity and phase identification of KLaF4:5%Eu3+ nanoparticles prepared at various reaction times were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1). From the PXRD patterns, it is clear that two prominent peaks at angles 26.04° and 43.08° gradually emerged from 2 to 8 h of reaction time. At 2 h of reaction time, the two peaks became broad and from a reaction time of 4 h onwards the peaks became very prominent along with other peaks at angles 30.10, 50.94, 53.34, 62.7, 68.84 and 70.96°. However, at a 10 h reaction time, new intense peaks at angles 27.42°, 28.34° and 48.90° started appearing along with previous peaks. From 12 h of reaction time onwards, the samples showed prominent peaks at 27.42° and 28.34° along with other peaks at 15.62, 36.20, 39.40, 47.60, 48.24, 48.90, 55.74, 56.30, 64.26, 70.04 and 76.96° angles. We observed that all the peaks are relatively broader, indicating the nano-crystallinity. Furthermore, with an increase in the reaction time, the KLaF4 sample gradually transformed from one crystal packing to another, which was also experimented and discussed in the following sections.
 Fig. 1  Powder XRD pattern of KLaF4:5% Eu3+ samples prepared at a temperature of 65 °C at different reaction times. 
The powder XRD patterns of the KLaF4:5%Eu3+ samples at various reaction times are investigated to study the lattice parameters, crystal packing, phase purity and site symmetry in detail. Fig. 2 shows the powder XRD patterns of the KLaF4 samples (of Fig. 1) along with the Rietveld refinement fits based on the available structural data for three specific reaction times.35,36 As evident from Fig. 2(a), KLaF4 at 4 h of reaction time confirms the cubic phase of space group Fmm (JCPDS No. 75-2020; #225), whereas the 14 h reaction time sample shows pure phase hexagonal crystal packing with space group P2m (JCPDS No. 75-1927; #189) as shown in Fig. 2(c). However, the 10 h reaction time yielded KLaF4 sample shows mixed/intermediate phases of both cubic and hexagonal ones (Fig. 2(b)). Therefore, the PXRD pattern categorically suggests that there is a systematic phase transformation from the cubic to hexagonal crystal phases with an increase of the reaction time. Both cubic and hexagonal KLaF4 crystal packing and phase purity are invariant even up to 21% of rare-earth ion doping, but the spectra features show marked changes.19,20

KLaF4:5%Eu3+ (up to 8 h of reaction time) is isomorphic to a cubic CaF2 fluorite structure and refined with one type of high symmetry cation site with respect to the internal standards of CaF2 (Fmm). Here Ca2+ (4a) site is randomly occupied by half of K1+ and half of La3+ ions along with F− ions at site 8c (Fig. 2(a)). The refined unit cell parameter a (Å) and GOF values are 5.9562(50) and 1.50 S, respectively. The crystallographic refinement data and reliability factors after the final cycle of refinement are listed in the ESI, Tables S1 and S2.† The hexagonal phase of KLaF4 (>12 h reaction time) is isomorphic to the β1-K2UF6 structure, with the formula of (KLaF4)1.5.37 In the Rietveld refinement of β-KLaF4 of space group P2m, site 1a is exclusively filled with La3+ ions while site 2d is shared by  and  ions. Sites 3f and 3g are equally occupied by six F− ions. The lattice constants a (Å), c (Å) and GOF are calculated to be 6.529(32), 3.825(35) and 1.70 S, respectively, after the final cycle of refinement. All crystallographic structure refinement parameters are displayed in the ESI, Tables S3 and S4.† The mixed/intermediate KLaF4 sample at a reaction time of 10 h (Fig. 1 and 2) is slightly tricky and composed of both cubic and hexagonal phase powder XRD reflections. The powder XRD pattern of this sample is refined using both cubic and hexagonal JCPDS files, and the calculated refinement parameters are cubic a (Å) = 5.938 and hexagonal a (Å) = 6.527 and c (Å) = 3.147 (Fig. 2(b)). In the intermediate/mixed phase, the monophase cubic nanoparticles initially persist with cubic symmetry, but due to thermodynamic control (reaction time), the resultant crystallite deform into a hexagonal phase. Due to the deformation of crystal packing, the diffraction planes have different distances and cause different Bragg angles, as can be confirmed by a slight shift in the angle with increasing reaction time, (with transformation α → β). Due to a change in the distance of diffraction planes, the lattice constants differ from the individual lattice constants of pure cubic or hexagonal phases.
The crystal structure and average particle size of the as-synthesized KLaF4 nanoparticles at different times of reaction were analysed by HRTEM. The diameter of the spherical geometry nanoparticles ranges from 4 to 8 nm (Fig. 3(a)), which is close to the powder XRD Debye–Scherrer formula estimate of ∼6 nm, using the prominent diffraction plane of (111). In the HRTEM image (Fig. 3(b)), the lattice fringes of the individual nanoparticles indicate good crystallinity with the adjacent distance between two lattice fringes being calculated to be 0.33 nm corresponding to the lattice plane (1 1 1) of the cubic KLaF4 lattice. The TEM images of the intermediate phase (10 h reaction) and hexagonally ordered fluoride nanoparticles are also shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d).

Now it is interesting to observe the site selectivity and crystal packing around the RE3+ ion occupation. While the rare-earth f–f transition energies are invariant with the host matrix, the site occupation of RE3+ and its surrounded crystal field strongly influences the radiative and nonradiative transitions.38 The electron cloud distortion of the cations in the hexagonal ALnF4 arrangement is significantly different from that of its high-symmetry cationic sites in cubic polymorphs. It is evident from previous sections that in ALaF4 the structural flip from the cubic to hexagonal phase is the transformation from the more disordered to order re-arrangement of atoms in its cationic sites.39–43 In the cubic phase of KLaF4, the La3+ ions are distributed on the site 4a which has Oh crystallographic symmetry. During the RE3+ doping, the La3+ ions are replaced by RE3+ ions in the lattice. In the present case, the ionic radius of RE3+ is lower than that of the La3+ ions, therefore, the bond length of RE-F is supposed to be smaller than that of La-F. As a result, the co-ordination shell around the 4a site filled with La3+ and K+ ions could be slightly distorted. According to the microscopic model of the disorder, the local site symmetry Oh in the cubic phase of each subset of Eu3+ ions will be eventually reduced to lower site symmetries, Cs, C2 or C1.
Similarly in the hexagonal phase, the local site symmetry D3h (site 2d) of each subset of RE3+ ions will be reduced to their lower site symmetries, such as D3.44,45 Thus, the structural flip from cubic to hexagonal is expected to show significant changes in the spectral features of the structural probe, Eu3+ and technologically important Er3+/Yb3+ ions. Such studies are systematically presented in the following sections.


(b) Red-to-orange (R/O) PL emission ratio sensitivity to down-conversion photoluminescence (DC-PL) in the Eu3+doped KLaF4 nanocrystals. 
The photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and down-conversion photoluminescence (PL) spectra of KLaF4:5%Eu3+ at different reaction times are shown in Fig. 4. Four PL peaks (excited at λex = 395 nm) were observed at 595, 614, 650, and 700 nm corresponding to transitions 5D0 → 7FJ, (J = 1, 2, 3, 4) respectively. The PLE spectra, monitored at λem = 614 nm of 5D0 → 7F2, show typical signature excitation peaks of Eu3+ spanning within the 350–550 nm spectral range, originating from 7F0 and 7F1 to various excitation levels.44,45 It is also seen that the prominence of the phonon energies in terms of phonon-assisted side bands (PSB's, at 22371.3 cm−1 and 22831.0 cm−1) is associated with the electronic transition 7F0 → 5D2 suggesting the strong microscopic environment around the Eu3+ ions in the KLaF4 host. The schematic diagram of all possible PLE and PL transitions of Eu3+ ions is shown in Fig. 4(b).

To explore more about the symmetry and site occupation local environment of Eu3+ ions in the KLaF4 host lattice prepared at different reaction times, the laser-excited PL spectra were recorded under 405 nm diode laser excitation. For all the reaction times, the PL spectra were dominated by lower-order transitions 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4). The weak higher-order transitions (5D1 → 7FJ; J = 0, 1, 2) are possible when the host possesses low phonon energies, which eventually help in the enhancement of radiative probabilities.
Typical ALaF4 (A = Na+, K+) hosts contain relatively low phonon energies (for cubic 316 cm−1 and hexagonal 262 cm−1) and hence the Eu3+ ions in the as-prepared phosphors excited to upper-level 5D2 deactivate progressively to the lowest energy 5D1/5D0 levels by fast non-radiative multi-phonon relaxation.20,21 The study of the laser excitation power dependence spectra and their corresponding peak intensity variation shows that the excitation process is one-photon absorption (Fig. S1†). Porcher et al. reported in low phonon KY3F10:Eu3+ that the de-excitation of 5D2 to 5D1 is possible by achieving the energy separation of ∼2500 cm−1 utilizing seven phonon (360 cm−1) energies.46 Rabouw et al47 reported a very weak emission in NaYF4:Eu3+ from the 5D2 level and demonstrated relatively fast lifetimes for 5D1 with respect to 5D0. In our present system, the very weak higher-order emission from 5D1 is observed only in cubic KLaF4 but could not be detected in the hexagonal system (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  (a–c) Laser excited PL spectra of Eu3+ doped KLaF4 nanoparticles excited at λex = 405 nm with a CW laser. The grey color plots in (a–c) are with 10× magnification to visualize 5D1 transitions. (d) Asymmetric PL intensity ratios of the 5D0 → 7F2 to 5D0 → 7F1(R/O) transitions for the samples at various reaction times. 
The laser excited PL spectra show two prominent peaks corresponding to transitions 5D0 → 7F1 (orange) and 5D0 → 7F2 (red) at wavelengths of 595 and 614 nm respectively. The magnetic dipole (MD) transition 5D0 → 7F1 is not influenced by metal–ligand bonding and insensitive to the crystal environment, while the electric dipole (ED) transition 5D0 → 7F2 is hypersensitive and can be strongly influenced by local factors such as the local symmetry of Eu3+ ions.44
Thus, the ratio (R/O) of the hypersensitive transition (5D0 → 7F2, red) to that of the invariant transition (5D0 → 7F1, orange) is widely accepted to represent the degree of distortion from the inversion symmetry and the local environment of the Eu3+ ion in the host lattice. Therefore, the asymmetric (R/O) ratio is widely considered to be a structural probe, because the Eu emission/excitation spectral details give insight into the relative strength of covalent and ionic bonding between the Eu3+ ions and the surrounding ligands.48,49
Longer exposure time scans are also performed to avoid any laser-based stability issues, and the results are shown in Fig. 5(d) and Fig. S2.† For comparison, the PL spectra related to pure cubic phase (4 h), mixed/intermediate phase (10 h) and pure hexagonal phase (14 h) are highlighted in Fig. 5(a)–(c). The asymmetric ratios R/O (i.e., 5D0 → 7F2vs.5D0 → 7F1) for all samples are shown in Fig. 5(d). As seen, the asymmetric ratio R/O is invariant with the prolonged exposure of an excitation laser. What is more interesting is, the R/O ratio in the pure cubic phase is between 1.2 and 1.8, whereas in the pure hexagonal phase, it is markedly very high and ranges between 2.6 and 3.1. The asymmetric ratio R/O = 1.2–1.8 for the cubic phase KLaF4 nanocrystals indicates that the Eu3+ ions are located in the centrosymmetric site. In the hexagonal phase, these R/O values are dominated by the highly influenced hypersensitive transition (5D0 → 7F2) and are highly perturbed and also strongly influenced by the Eu–F covalency and local symmetry. Thus, these studies broadly confirm that the crystal phase flips show enormous changes in the emission spectral features due to the different site selectivity and covalent/ionic bonding surrounded by the RE3+ ions.


(c) Up-conversion photoluminescence (UP-PL) color flips in the Er3+/Yb3+ doped KLaF4 nanocrystals. 
Low-phonon energy fluoride nanocrystals with Er3+ doping along with Yb3+ as a sensitizer are one of the most efficient up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for bio-imaging in vitro and in vivo, biological luminescent labels, MRI contrast agents, color displays, and super-resolution nanoscopy.50–52 These NIR excited UCNPs have potential to show either green (2H11/2 and 4S3/2) dominated or red (4F9/2) dominated emissions based on their cubic or hexagonal crystal packing.52 The up-conversion emission spectra of Er3+/Yb3+ are dominated by a series of energy-transfer processes such as multi-phonon relaxation, phonon-assisted energy migration and cross-relaxation under NIR laser excitation. The different non-harmonic phonon coupling phenomena in the cubic and hexagonal phases of NaYF4 were reported by the group of L. Wang.53 They observed that the non-harmonic phonon coupling is stronger in the disordered form of α-NaYF4 than in ordered β-NaYF4. However, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive study of the green and red variation in Er3+/Yb3+ UCNPs to crystal packing has not been reported.
The reconfirmation of the crystal packing and phase identification, similar to those of KLaF4:Eu3+ nanoparticles, by powder XRD, has also been performed in the KLaF4:Er3+/Yb3+ nanocrystals synthesized at various reaction times and indexed accordingly (Fig. S3†). According to the diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. S4†), several absorption transitions were observed for the Er3+ (4I15/2 → 4F7/2, 2H11/2, 4I11/2,4S3/2, 4F9/2) and sensitizer Yb3+ ions at 976 nm (2F7/2 → 2F5/2). A strong band edge at 297 nm (∼3.85 eV) was observed, and it is probably masked by strong ligand to metal (LMCT) and metal to ligand (MLCT) type charge transfer peaks, the absorption of Yb3+ and Yb2+ valence forms etc.54–56
The multi-colour up-conversion emission spectra measured upon 980 nm laser excitation are shown in Fig. 6(a). The three emission peaks at 522, 544 (green) and 657 nm (red) were attributed to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions, respectively.

(b) The integrated intensity ratio of the green and red emission of UCNPs prepared at different reaction times. The transition from cubic to hexagonal polymorphs is indicated by color shaded area. 
The phase conversion from the cubic to hexagonal crystal packing with the reaction time is also clearly reflected in the up-conversion emission studies. The camera pictures of the 980 nm excited up-conversion PL from the nanoparticles, as seen by the naked eye, are also shown in Fig. 6(a). The cubic phase nanoparticles demonstrate intense green color, as a result of dominant UC emissions from the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 transitions, whereas, the hexagonal crystal packing results in dominant red color due to the strong red-end emission from the 4F9/2 transition. The red to green color ratio, R/G1 (2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2) marked variation from 0.6 to 2.7, confirms the same (Fig. 6(b)).
The relationship between the UC emission intensity (I) and laser power (P) is defined by the expression I ∝ Pn, where n is the number of pump photons absorbed per emitted up-converted photon.57 The UC emissions at different powers and the log–log plots of the UC emission intensity (I) as a function of excitation power (P) are presented in Fig. 7. The nonlinear excitation power slopes for all the prominent transitions shown in Fig. 7(d–f) suggest that the UC emission is promoted via a two-photon nonlinear excitation process. In typical Er3+ systems, the two-photon induced upconversion process via Yb3+ sensitizer, follows typically I ∝ Pn, where n is in the range from 1.4 to 1.8 for various emission energies. Such values of n (<2) are due to many factors involving phonon energies, stark splitted energies, cross-relaxations etc.58 To ascertain the nonlinear up-conversion energy transfer processes, the laser excitation power dependence is also examined for the nanocrystals of the cubic (4 h reaction), mixed/intermediate (10 h) and hexagonal (14 h) phases (Fig. 7).

The possible energy transfer UC mechanism in the Er3+/Yb3+ doped fluoride nanoparticles is presented in Fig. S5.† Several concurrent electron transports, non-radiative transitions and relaxation mechanisms are responsible for the production of green/red emissions. As discussed in the previous sections, in the cubic phase of KLaF4, doped RE3+ will be randomly distributed in the lattice, at low symmetry sites. Here, in Er3+/Yb3+ doped nanoparticles, the UC emission is from the GSA/ESA processes [4I15/2 + pumped photon → 4I11/2 → 4F7/2] and the energy transfer (ET) from the Yb3+ sensitizer to Er3+ activator ions. Since the absorption cross-sections of the Yb3+ ions at pump energy are higher than those of the Er3+ ions, the energy absorbed by the sensitizer is transferred to the adjacent energy levels of the Er3+ ions via different ET assisted UC (ETAU) processes (Fig. S5†). In short, the Er3+ ions are excited from the ground state to the excited state via energy transfers ET1 and ET2 from neighbouring Yb3+ ions (4I15/2 + 2F5/2 → 4I11/2 + 2F7/2) and (4I11/2 + 2F5/2 → 4F7/2 + 2F7/2) and then the green-emitting levels 2H11/2, and 4S3/2 are populated by non-radiative transitions of 4F7/2 (Fig. 7d–f). Despite ET1 and ET2, ET4 (4I11/2 + 4I11/2 → 4F7/2 + 4I15/2) also contributes a part to the increment of the population of the 2H11/2, 4S3/2 states. This process is possibly due to the long-lived 4I11/2 energy level. Sequentially, the non-radiative relaxations from 4I11/2 populate the 4I13/2 level. Similarly, the red-emitting level 4F9/2 of the Er3+ ions is populated through ETAU processes: (i) ET3 (4I13/2 + 2F5/2 → 4F9/2 + 2F7/2), (ii) CR process (4F7/2 + 4I11/2 → 4F9/2 + 4F9/2) between two adjacent Er3+ ions and (iii) energy back transfer EBT (a) 2F7/2 (Yb3+) + 4S3/2 (Er3+) → 4I13/2 (Er3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+) and (b) 2F7/2 (Yb3+) + 4F7/2 (Er3+) → 4I11/2 (Er3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+) processes. Besides these ET and EBT processes, back energy transfer from 4F9/2 to 4S3/2 is also possible and it depends on the crystal packing and site occupation.58 The green emission may be dominated by the red emission due to the back energy transfer (BET) process of the 4F9/2 energy level.59 During the cross-relaxation within the Er3+ ions, two neighboring ions at energy level 4F9/2, share their energy in such a way that one electron goes to the 4S3/2 level and another deactivates to the lower level 4I9/2. The 4S3/2 level is also populated by the back transfer, a part of energy from the 4F9/2 level. Finally, radiative transitions 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (521 nm), 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (541 nm), and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (651 nm) occur in the green and red regions. The red emission at 657 nm corresponding to the transition 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 of hexagonal β-KLaF4:Er3+/Yb3+ (14 h of reaction time) is higher by a factor of ∼11 than that of cubic phase α-KLaF4:Er3+/Yb3+ (4 h of reaction time). This confirms that the back-energy transfer (BET) due to the well-ordered site symmetry of the Yb3+/Er3+ ions in the host lattice occurred with the UC mechanism by two-step energy transfer (ET) from the excited state of Yb3+ (2F5/2) to the energy level 4I11/2 of the Er3+ ions. The BET process (a) defines the depopulation in the excited levels 2H11/2/4S3/2 (Er3+) which causes the quenching of green light (522 and 544 nm) emission. Simultaneously, a saturation occurs in the excited level 4I13/2 (Er3+) and an energy transformation process 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 4I13/2 (Er3+) → 4F9/2 (Er3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+) takes place and directly increases the population of photons in the 4F9/2 red emission level. The CIE 1931 XY diagram of the KLaF4:Er3+/Yb3+ nanocrystals is presented in Fig. S6.† The calculated CIE color coordinates shifted from green to red with increasing reaction time.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated strong upconverted photoluminescence color flips from low phonon energy in biocompatible fluoride nanocrystals KLaF4:Er3+/Yb3+via a systematic phase transition from the cubic (space group Fmm) to hexagonal phase (space group P2m). The systematic phase transformation has been achieved by simple, one-pot room-temperature wet chemistry at different reaction times, from 2 h to 14 h. The X-ray diffraction patterns were refined with cubic, cubic/hexagonal and hexagonal phases. The obtained lattice constants were as follows: cubic a (Å) = 5.9562(50), intermediated/mixed cubic a (Å) = 5.938 (14), hexagonal a (Å) = 6.5271(18) and c (Å) = 3.147(06) and hexagonal a (Å) = 6.529(32) and c (Å) = 3.825 (35), respectively. The nanoparticle size, size distribution and crystal phase were further supported by TEM analysis. With the doping of the Eu3+ structural probe, the photoluminescence of the KLaF4:Eu3+ nanocrystals reveals the specific site selectivity that is clearly distinguishable in both cubic and hexagonal polymorphs. The significant enhancement in the asymmetric ratio of the red to orange (R/O) down-conversion PL peaks, i.e., the ratio of the hypersensitive transition (5D0 → 7F2, red) to that of the invariant transition (5D0 → 7F1, orange) supports the distortion of the local site symmetry, sensitive to phase transformation. These results favourably suggest the deformation of site occupation from high site symmetry (Oh) to lower site symmetries (Cs, C2 or C1) in the cubic phase, whereas in the hexagonal crystal packing the transformation is from D3h site symmetry to D3 lower site symmetry. Thus, the strong color flip, if the asymmetric ratio (R/O) varies from 1.2 to 3.0 in the Eu3+ emission during the progressive phase transformation, inadvertently confirms that Eu3+ acts as an active spectroscopic probe for the local structure around the rare-earth ion occupation. The phase evaluation of the strong upconversion emitting KLaF4:0.5Er3+/20%Yb3+ nanocrystals was performed and it was found, for the first time, that the strong color tunability from green to red is possible by the rearrangement of crystal packing and site symmetry. The red to green color ratio R/G1 (2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2) variation from 0.6 to 2.7 is observed during the crystal structural change from cubic to hexagonal. Such a phase-related color change was successfully explained by the site occupancy, the phonon energies and the strong influence of various nonlinear energy transfer mechanisms. Furthermore, the great enhancement in the red emission (by a factor of ∼11), witnessed in the hexagonal phase, is possibly due to the back-energy transfer (BET) process between the Yb3+ and Er3+ ions. These studies can also be further extended to other rare-earth color markers (such as Er3+–Tm3+–Yb3+, Ho3+–Yb3+etc.) for a wide range of color selectivities from these biocompatible low-cost nanocrystals. Finally, the results are of broad interest in the sense that various polymorphs can be easily harvested and utilized for various multi-color applications such as biological imaging, 3D displays, LEDs, and solar cells.
