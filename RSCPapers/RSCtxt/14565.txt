, Accepted 30th September 2016First published on 3rd October 2016AbstractA series of novel acceptor–donor–acceptor–donor–acceptor (A2–D–A1–D–A2) structured acceptor oligomers with naphthalene diimide (NDI) as centre and acceptor unit (A1), oligothiophenes (T = 1, 2, 3, 4) as π-bridges (D), and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine (DCRD) as terminal groups (A2) have been investigated using quantum chemistry and Marcus theory in this research. Compared with NDI-2T1Me—NDI-2T4Me, the NDI-2T1DCRD—NDI-2T4DCRD exhibit stronger and wider absorption peaks because of the increase of the electron withdrawing ability of the electron deficient units. In particular for the NDI-2T3DCRD, the electron mobility (μe = 5.71 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1) was accurately predicted quantitatively using first principle simulation. The blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) with NDI-2T3DCRD as an active layer exhibits obviously strong and wide light absorption, which form a perfectly complementary absorption. The results indicate that the incorporation of DCRD as acceptor units into D–A–D type oligomers has been proven to create promising candidates for high efficiency acceptor materials for organic solar cells (OSCs). Overall, this research may provide a theoretical guidance for designing small molecular acceptors for OSC applications.
1 Introduction
Solar energy has the advantages of being clean, unlimited, renewable, and readily available, and has already been extensively studied with various energy resources as an alternative to other exhausted energy resources.1,2 As the most important applications of solar energy, organic solar cells (OSCs) have advantages in solution processing, are potentially lightweight, have low cost fabrication, and have flexibility, all of which are promising cost-effective alternatives to inorganic solar cells.3,4 Over the past few years, significant progress has been made with OSCs materials based on a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure with a conjugated organic semiconductor as electron donor and fullerene derivative as electron acceptor, and these materials have achieved a dramatic improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 10% for polymer-based OSC architectures. For example, Liu et al.5 developed the multiple polymer: fullerene combinations via the formation of a near ideal polymer/fullerene morphology with the PCE reaching up to 10.8% and fill factors (FF) up to 77%. Chen et al.6 achieved 10.1% PCE by implementing deterministic aperiodic nanostructure (DAN) patterning for broadband, self-enhanced light absorption with optimum charge extraction in the single junction polymer solar cells.
However, the fullerene derivative acceptor materials have many considerable drawbacks, which considerably limit the further development of PCEs in OSCs. Such drawbacks are: (1) negligible light absorption in the visible near infrared (NIR) region,7–10 and (2) a narrow range of accessible lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels limiting the accessible photovoltage. In comparison, non-fullerene acceptor materials (including polymers and small molecules) are superior to conventional fullerene materials and have easily adjustable energy levels, simple synthesis, and a low cost of production.11–13 More importantly, this type of material has a wider light absorption in the solar visible region.14,15 In addition, the small molecular oligomers have more advantages over polymer materials, such as the definite molecular weight, well defined molecular structure, and high purity without batch to batch variations.16–19 They have easily adjustable highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO), and LUMO levels, medium energy gaps (Eg), as well as promising carrier (hole or electron) transport properties.20,21 Recently, Zhao et al.22 reported a small molecular compound 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC)23,24 which was used to replace the fullerene-based acceptors, a state-of-the-art PCE of 11.21% for polymer solar cells (PSCs) was demonstrated. This indicates that small molecular oligomers have a promising potential for replacing fullerene derivatives and enhancing the performance of OSC devices.
Alternations of electron rich units (D) and electron deficient units (A) in designing a small molecular backbone are an effective strategy to improve the performance of OSCs.25 Kim et al.26 achieved the maximum photocurrent response (13%) in the D–A–A type ternary cells, and Jung and Jo27 have shown a PCE of 5.0% with small D–A–D–A–D type molecules composed of benzothiadiazole and diketopyrrolopyrrole as non-fullerene electron acceptors. This demonstrates that it is an effective strategy to improve the PCE when the small molecular acceptors are designed with suitable D-units and A-units. Lately, aromatic diimide derivatives [such as naphthalene diimide (NDI) and perylene diimide] are promising n-type materials for fabricating OSCs because of their excellent optoelectronic properties, good oxidative and thermal stabilities, large electron affinities, and high electron mobilities.28–30 Interestingly, it is found that the reported acceptors based on aromatic diimide also have the D–A structures, which have complementary electronic and optical properties with polymer donors, narrow band gaps and high electron carrier mobilities.31–33 Earmme et al.,33 and Ahmed et al.34 have made some achievements using the NDI-based oligomers as acceptors. However, the solar cells generally exhibit low efficiencies (1–6%) when used with aromatic diimide derivatives as acceptor materials.33,35 In order to enhance the performance of D–A oligomers, it is necessary to understand how to simultaneously tune their electronic, optical, and charge transport properties.
In this research, a series of new A2–D–A1–D–A2 small molecules were designed using a strong electron withdrawing group of 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine (DCRD)36,37 as the A-units (A2) based on the π-conjugated oligomers34 with D–A configurations which are composed of a central electron withdrawing group of NDI (A1) and an electron donating group of oligothiophenes (D) (in Scheme 1) to further assess the criteria for new acceptor materials. The aim is to tune the HOMO/LUMO energy levels, to improve the light absorption properties so that there is a good match with the donor absorption bands, and to enhance the intermolecular carrier mobilities of the acceptor materials by increasing the electron withdrawing ability of the electron deficient unit of the D–A oligomers. The D–A architectures of the oligothiophene functionalized NDI molecules possessed all the advantages of the small molecules which were described previously,38–42 and they will be further applicable to tuning the material properties after modifications as will be described in this paper. According to Deng et al.43 the electron mobility of NDI-2T3DCRD (μe = 5.71 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1) was accurately predicted quantitatively using a first principles simulation.

Furthermore, the light absorption performance of the D–A acceptors in the active layer combined with the classical polymer donor, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) (P3HT/NDI-2T3Me and P3HT/NDI-2T3DCRD) was also determined. The results demonstrate that the A2–D–A1–D–A2 type oligomers possess a supplementary light absorption in the visible NIR region with P3HT, which may contribute to the short-circuit current (Jsc) in OSC applications.
2 Computational methodologies
2.1 The frontier molecular orbital theory and spectrum simulation
In this work, the ground state geometry optimizations and spectra simulations of all the investigated oligomers were performed using density functional theory44,45 (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), respectively. The spin-restricted DFT and the unrestricted DFT were used to optimize the ground state geometries and the ion state geometries,46 respectively. All of the alkyl branched chains of the polymers were replaced by methyl groups (Me) to simplify the calculation because the alkyl branched chains have little effect on the optoelectronic properties.47,48 Several hybrid functionals (B3LYP,49 M06,50 and PBE0 51) at the 6-31G** and 6-311G** basis set level were used to obtain the appropriate energy level, which is consistent with the experimental value as much as possible. The test results are summarized in the ESI (Table S1†). As shown in Table S1,† the calculated HOMO level of NDI-2T3H at the PBE0/6-311G** level (−5.64 eV) is in accordance with the experimental data (−5.6 eV). Furthermore, all the structures used for optimization have no imaginary frequencies, which suggest that all the investigated structures have the minima on the potential energy surfaces. For the optical properties, we chose four hybrid functionals (B3LYP, PBE0, BMK52 and CAM-B3LYP53) at the 6-311G** basis set level to simulate the absorption spectra of NDI-2T3H on the basis of the optimized ground state structure. It can be seen from Table S2 (ESI†) that the maximum absorbance wavelength of NDI-2T3H at the BMK/6-311G** level (599 nm) agrees well with the experimental result (607 nm), and the peak pattern is also consistent with that of the ref. 34. Based on the previous test, the PBE0/6-311G** level was selected to optimize the ground structures and the BMK/6-311G** level was chosen to simulate the absorption spectra of all the oligomers. The DFT and TD-DFT calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program.54
2.2 Marcus charge transfer theory
Generally, the motion of carriers (including hole and electron) has two representative models—the coherent band and incoherent hopping.55 Under the conditions of ambient temperature, the hopping process is generally considered as the main model in organic solar materials about charge transport path.56 In order to completely investigate the carriers' motion, Marcus theory57,58 was used to evaluate the rates of the charge transportation process which includes exciton dissociation and charge recombination. The charge transfer rate (k) is expressed as:56,59 
(1)where V is the electronic coupling strength between two adjacent acceptor molecular segments, λ is the reorganization energy, ℏ is the Dirac constant (also named as reduced Planck constant) which equals to h/2π, T is the general temperature (T = 300 K used in these calculations), and KB is the Boltzmann constant.
The reorganization energy is defined as the energy difference between the charged and neutral systems at the two different geometries. Generally, the reorganization energy is constituted with internal (λint) and external (λext) contributions.60–62 The λint is established by the changes in equilibrium geometry of the donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties, while the λext results from changes in the electronic and nuclear polarization of the surrounding medium upon charge transfer.63,64 Reports of research on the λext present several modern methods combining molecular mechanics and quantum mechanics, but the appropriate method for calculating the value of λext is also ambiguous, that is to say, the accurate calculation is still not easy in theory. In this work the λext is neglected under conditions of ignoring any changes of environment, only the λint is taken into consideration here and this is composed of the hole reorganization energy (λ+) and the electron reorganization energy (λ−) as the main factor in this work. The λint for λ+ and λ− are defined by eqn (2),65–67 and the potential energy curve is presented in Scheme 2: 
λ± = λ1 + λ2 = E±(M0) − E±(M±) + E0(M±) − E0(M0)
(2)where E±(M0) is the single point energy of the cation (anion) based on the optimized structure of the neutral molecule, E0(M±) is the single point energy of the neutral molecule based on the optimized structure of the anion (cation) molecule, E±(M±) is the energy of the anion (cation) structure at the anion (cation) state, and E0(M0) is the energy of the neutral molecule at the ground state.
 Scheme 2  The reorganization energy in the potential energy curve. 
The coupling strength can be calculated using the Marcus–Hush model at room temperature.56 The electronic coupling strength (V) is calculated by Marcus theory as:68 
(3)where J is the charge transfer integral of electrons, S is the spatial overlap, and ε1 and ε2 are the site energies. In this study, only the face-to-face π-stacking was taken into consideration to calculate the electronic coupling of NDI-2T3DCRD, NDI-2T4DCRD and NDI-2T3Me by employing the site energy correction method.67,69–71 The λ was calculated by employing the Gaussian 09 program with PBE0/6-311G** level, and V was calculated using the PW91/TZP method72,73 using the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF; Software for Chemistry and Materials, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) package based on the ground state of corresponding molecules.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 The properties of frontier molecular orbitals
The suitable HOMO/LUMO levels and the medium Eg are the prerequisite for an ideal acceptor in OSC applications, because they have close relationship with the solar cell efficiencies to ensure photo-induced electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor.47,74 The calculations and analyses of HOMO/LUMO and Eg are significantly important for the prediction of electronic and optical properties. The orbital diagrams of HOMO and LUMO of all oligomers are plotted in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†), and it can be seen that the HOMO → LUMO electron transitions of the oligomers all transfer from the electron rich segments (D) to the electron deficient ones (A1), and there are almost no energy distributions in the terminal groups. All the calculated results of HOMO, LUMO and Eg,TD are listed in Table 1 (the LUMO energy levels are taken from LUMO = HOMO + Eg,TD75).

The calculated HOMO of NDI-2T1Me—NDI-2T4Me (−6.16, −5.72, −5.51, −5.40 eV, respectively) are in good agreement with the experimental values34 (−6.1, −5.7, −5.5, −5.46 eV, respectively), in Table 1, which suggests that the methodology is reasonable for this system. In Table 1, it can be seen that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are all dramatically decreased after introducing the DCRD group, but the values of Eg show little variation. However, with the increase in the number of thiophene (T = 1, 2, 3, 4), the HOMO and LUMO energy levels increase to some extent, whether the DCRD group (NDI-2T1DCRD < NDI-2T2DCRD < NDI-2T3DCRD < NDI-2T4DCRD) is introduced or not (NDI-2T1Me < NDI-2T2Me < NDI-2T3Me < NDI-2T4Me). However, their Eg gradually reduce (NDI-2T1Me > NDI-2T2Me > NDI-2T3Me > NDI-2T4Me, NDI-2T1DCRD > NDI-2T2DCRD > NDI-2T3DCRD > NDI-2T4DCRD), which is beneficial to improving the short-circuit current (Jsc). In order to obtain a high PCE for organic solar cells, both the orbital energy levels and the band gaps of donor or acceptor materials should be optimized simultaneously. In this regard, this has achieved perfectly the appropriate energy levels and medium band gaps.
According to the empirical equations of HOMO/LUMO = −(Eonsetox/red + 4.8) eV (ref. 76 and 77) and IP/EA = (Eonsetox/red + 4.4) eV (ref. 34), the HOMO/LUMO energy has a close connection with the ionization potential (IP)/electron affinity (EA), respectively.78–80 The calculated results of IP and EA are shown in Table 4, and the detailed analysis will be presented in the section about the charge transfer properties.
3.2 Optical properties
The optical properties of materials play an important role in the values of Jsc for OSCs, but the conventional fullerene derivatives have nearly negligible light absorption in the visible region, which cannot be supplemented with the donor materials and leads to the low PCEs in OSCs.7,81,82 Therefore, the non-fullerene acceptors with a strong and wide absorption spectrum in visible and NIR should be designed to complement the absorption band of the donor to improve the Jsc of the OSCs.67 According to the theoretical mechanism of the OSCs, the Jsc is the current density through the circuit when the applied voltage is zero (as Voc), which is greatly significant for the further improvement of the efficiency of OSCs, which can be expressed as:83,84 
(4)where the sum(λ) is the number of incident photons with a wavelength λ per unit area, ηA(λ) is the ratio of the number of photons absorbed by the active layer (the phase separated donor/acceptor blend layer) to that of incident photons, and φIQE(λ) is the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) which is defined as the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the electrode to the number of absorbed photons.83 In eqn (4), it can be seen that ηA(λ) plays a direct, indispensable role in development of Jsc in the active layer, this is very important in analysis of the light absorbing efficiency. Some reports have defined the ηA(λ) as:67,85,86 
η(λ) = 1 − 10−f
(5)where f is the oscillator strength of the oligomers associated with a certain wavelength (λ). From eqn (4) and (5), it can be seen that enhancing the optical property is a prerequisite for acceptor oligomers to achieve the improvement of the light absorbing efficiency and light harvesting range.
For all the molecules, TD-DFT calculations were performed to evaluate the excitation energy, oscillator strength, and electronic configurations. Because the problems associated with the multi-electronic self-interaction errors, conventional semi-local and standard hybrid DFT functions were confirmed to have many shortcomings for the description of the charge transfer excitations.87–90 In order to make up for these limitations, the approach of Baer and Kronik was adopted91,92 and this employed the long range corrected (LRC) hybrid functionals (BMK and CAM-B3LYP) in chloroform solutions where the range separation parameter was tuned for each chemical structure. Previous reports93,94 have noted that the CAM-B3LYP functional only has a 65% Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange at long range instead of the full 100% asymptotic HF exchange required, and spurious results were obtained. This suggests that the CAM-B3LYP functional has a deficiency in some conjugated systems, which may be the reason the results of the calculated results largely disagree with the experimental results. Thus, it is very important to tune the range separated functionals to obtain more accurate excitation energies.95–98 It should be noted that just the TD-DFT results (only the first 25 excited states were considered) obtained from the BMK functional were used qualitatively to agree with the experimental results in this work. Absorption spectra were simulated through convolution of the transition energies90 and oscillator strengths with Gaussian functions were characterized using the half band width (HBW) of 2000 cm−1. The simulated optical absorption spectra are presented in Fig. 1 and they were obtained using Swizard software,99,100 and some primary optical parameters of NDI-2T1Me—NDI-2T4Me are listed in Table S3 (ESI†) and NDI-2T1DCRD—NDI-2T4DCRD are listed in Table 2.

In Table S3 (ESI†), it can be seen that the maximum absorptions and the shape of the peaks of NDI-2T1Me—NDI-2T4Me (497, 576, 614, 631 nm, respectively) are in good agreement with the experiments34 (525, 604, 632, 638 nm, respectively), which suggests that using the TD-BMK/6-311G** level is perfectly reasonable to calculate the optical properties based on the optimized ground state structures at the PBE0/6-311G** level. Compared with the experiments, the NDI-2T1DCRD—NDI-2T4DCRD have larger oscillator strengths (f) and higher light absorbing efficiencies (η(λ)) (see Table 2). The first absorption peaks (S0 → S3) for NDI-2T1DCRD—NDI-2T4DCRD are 376, 431, 471, 497 nm, respectively, and the main electronic transitions are from the HOMO to LUMO+2. Compared with NDI-2T1Me—NDI-2T4Me (292, 340, 376, 407 nm), the former absorption peaks have obviously red-shifted. However, the second absorption peaks (S0 → S1) seem to have the same absorption maximum as NDI-2T1DCRD—NDI-2T4DCRD (501, 567, 597, 614 nm, respectively) and NDI-2T1Me—NDI-2T4Me (497, 576, 614, 631 nm, respectively), and the main electronic configurations for all oligomers are from HOMO to LUMO.
Compared with NDI-2T1DCRD—NDI-2T4DCRD (in Fig. 1b) and NDI-2T1Me—NDI-2T4Me (in Fig. 1a), there are two obvious absorption peaks (f > 0.4) for all oligomers in the visible range (500–700 nm), which are consistent with the data in Tables 2 and S3 (ESI†), respectively. In Fig. 1, it can be seen that the first absorption peaks seem to have the same molar absorptivities whether appending with the terminal group of Me or DCRD, although the absorption maximums have red-shifted a lot. Interestingly, the second absorption peaks have dramatically higher molar absorptivities after replacing the Me with DCRD in terminal group, which may be because of the larger oscillator strengths caused by the strong electron withdrawing effect of DCRD. Furthermore, with the increase number of thiophene for NDI-2T1Me—NDI-2T4Me, the absorption spectra are red-shifted and the absorption strength increased, particularly in the visible regions. After introducing the strong electron withdrawing group of DCRD (NDI-2T1DCRD—NDI-2T4DCRD), the absorption strength and width present the same trend as obtained with NDI-2T1Me—NDI-2T4Me, and the extents of strength and width are more apparent. Based on the previous analysis, this indicates that introducing the DCRD group to replace the terminal Me can effectively improve the light absorption efficiencies and dramatically contribute to the Jsc.
The donor materials absorb sunlight and excite them into electrons, and the more electrons that transfer from the donor to acceptor, the higher the performance of device. As shown in eqn (4), it was found that the efficient electron transfer from donor to acceptor can enhance the Jsc because it includes the term of exciton dissociation efficiency. Here, the electron transfer distance (ΔD), the overlap (normalization to the exchanged charge) between the regions of density depletion and increment (Ω)101 and the fraction of electron exchange (ΔF) for all the acceptors were calculated to explain how the introduction of electron withdrawing units of DCRD in place of the Me unit influence the intra-molecular charge transfer characters.67,101,102 The total electron density difference (∑∂i→j) between the initial and final states of photo excitation can be defined as the sum of all molecular orbital transitions including each participating excitation i → j (i and j denote the initial and final molecular orbital, respectively):86,101,103 
(6)where Ci→j is the orthogonal coefficient of the TD-DFT equation, ρi and ρj are the electron densities of each participating molecular orbital with respect to the transitions:86,104 
(7)where C, ηi, and χ denote the coefficient matrix, occupation number of orbital i, and basis function, respectively. The electron density differences between the initial and final states are in a linear combination of various electron transition models.75,86,104 All the calculated results can be performed with the cubman utility which is provided by the Gaussian 09 and Multiwfn software.105 Furthermore, two functions of ρ+(r) and ρ−(r) can be used for defining the increase and reduction of the density because of the transition. The centroids of the spatial regions are defined by ρ+(r) and ρ−(r), can be expressed as:75,101

The distance (D) of the charge transfer can be expressed as: 
D = |C+ − C−|

The fraction of electron exchange (F) can be defined as:

Based on the equations of the previously mentioned, the calculated corresponding data and diagrams are presented in Table 3 (for NDI-2T1DCRD—NDI-2T4DCRD) and Table S4 (ESI;† for NDI-2T1Me—NDI-2T4Me). In Table 3, it can be seen that the S0 → S1 electronic transitions of all the oligomers are HOMO → LUMO transitions, and the corresponding transfer directions are from the electron rich units to the electron deficient units. The ΔD increases with the extension of the number of thiophene, the sequence of ΔD is NDI-2T1DCRD (0.306 Å) < NDI-2T2DCRD (0.410 Å) < NDI-2T3DCRD (0.871 Å) < NDI-2T4DCRD (0.928 Å). The ΔF and Ω decrease with the increase of the number of thiophene, the tendency of ΔF is NDI-2T1DCRD (1.0969 e−) > NDI-2T2DCRD (1.0349 e−) > NDI-2T3DCRD (1.0263 e−) > NDI-2T4DCRD (1.0068 e−) and Ω is NDI-2T1DCRD (0.7203) > NDI-2T2DCRD (0.6355) > NDI-2T3DCRD (0.4837) > NDI-2T4DCRD (0.4534). Compared with the NDI-2T1Me—NDI-2T4Me (possessing the same sequences of ΔD and Ω with NDI-2T1DCRD—NDI-2T4DCRD in Table S4; ESI†), the NDI-2T1DCRD—NDI-2T4DCRD have larger ΔD and smaller Ω, but the ΔF reduces a little. The larger ΔD and smaller Ω are beneficial for enhancing the Jsc for the OSCs. The results indicate that the introduction of the strong electron withdrawing group, DCRD can contribute to the enhancement of the electron transfer distance and the charge separation by replacing the terminal group of Me. Based on the previously mentioned discussion, it can be concluded that it is obviously favorable for enhancing the light harvesting efficiency of these oligomer acceptors by increasing the electron withdrawing ability of the electron deficient unit.

3.3 Charge transport related properties
When the promising candidates for OSCs materials are designed, understanding the relationship between the molecular structure and the charge transport properties of the materials is essential. It is generally thought that charge transport includes the hole transport and electron transport. After the excitons dissociate at the interface layer, the hole and electron will be transported together with the donor and acceptor to the respective electrodes. In the process of transportation, the mobilities of the hole and electron are very important for the development of the performance of OSCs. Reports have demonstrated that the hole mobility of the donor material plays a crucial role in the organophotovoltaic performance.106 In the same way, the high electron mobility of the acceptor material in the electron transport process enhances the improvement of the PCEs. According to eqn (1), the charge transfer rate is directly determined using the reorganization energy (λ) and the electronic coupling strength (V). So it is inevitable that these two parameters are analyzed in this work, and λ was calculated using the Gaussian 09 program (see Table 4) and V was calculated using the ADF package (see Table 5).43,107,108

The IP and EA (both vertical and adiabatic), hole extraction potential (HEP) and electron extraction potential (EEP) were also calculated. The IP and EA represent the ability of the gain and loss for the electron, respectively, which can be used to assess the energy barrier in the process of electron injection.78 The p-type materials, which have relatively lower IPv and higher EAv, are conducive to the transport of electrons and holes in the process of exciton separation and transmission. Therefore, n-type materials should have a larger IP and EA compared with that of P3HT which has an EA value of 3.1 eV and an IP value of 5.0 eV derived from the values of the LUMO and HOMO level.34,78,80,109 For the calculated results of HEP and EEP, used the reports of Zhang et al.,78 Liu et al.79 and Sun et al.80
As shown in Table 4, after introducing the DCRD group as a replacement for the Me in the terminal group, the absolute values of IP and EA are increased greatly, and they have the same tendency with the absolute values of HOMO and LUMO energies, and the λ (including λ+ and λ−) reduces dramatically. That is to say, increasing the electron withdrawing ability of the electron deficient unit can improve the transport ability of the hole and electron simultaneously, especially the oligomers of NDI-2T3DCRD and NDI-2T4DCRD. With the number of thiophene increasing, the IP, EA, λ+ and λ− of NDI-2T1DCRD—NDI-2T4DCRD have the same tendency for variation as with NDI-2T1Me—NDI-2T4Me.
Based on the previous analysis, the charge mobilities (including electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh)) of NDI-2T3Me, NDI-2T3DCRD and NDI-2T4DCRD were calculated based on the ground state structures optimized using the Einstein relationship:110,111 
(12)where KB is the Boltzmann constant, T represents the temperature (300 K), D is the charge diffusion constant, and e is the electronic charge. D is defined as the ratio between the mean-squared displacement and the diffusion time in a d-dimensional system:65,112,113 
(13)where d represents the spatial dimension, i is a specific hopping pathway, ri is the charge hopping distance, ki is the charge transfer rate, and pi  is the probability of the electron hopping to the neighboring units. When only two adjacent molecular fragments are considered, D can be simply defined as:114 
(14)where kCT is the charge transfer rate and r denotes the intermolecular center-to-center distance. Therefore, μ is expressed as:65,103 
(15)
The calculated results of μ and its corresponding parameters are listed in Table 5 for μe and Table S5 (ESI†) for μh. The generalized charge transfer and the components were obtained using ADF. Here it must be stressed that the previously calculated process of electronic coupling is an ideal case and the effects from the outside environment were not considered.29
It can be seen from the results shown in Table 5 that the sequence of μe is NDI-2T3DCRD > NDI-2T4DCRD > NDI-2T3Me. From eqn (15), it can be seen that r and kCT are the main parameters for the charge mobility (μ). The kCT-e of NDI-2T3DCRD is larger than that of NDI-2T3Me mainly because of the higher V− and lower λ−, and the kCT-e of NDI-2T4DCRD is larger than that of NDI-2T3Me and this depends mainly on the dramatically lower value of λ−, which further results in the larger electron mobilities. The results reveal that increasing the electron withdrawing ability of the electron deficient unit (by replacing the Me group with DCRD in the terminal group) cannot only improve the intermolecular π stacking and electronic coupling, but can also reduce the electronic recombination. Furthermore, comparing the kCT-e of NDI-2T3DCRD with NDI-2T4DCRD, it was found that V− plays a key role in electron mobility despite NDI-2T4DCRD having a smaller λ−. In other words, three numbers of thiophene (T3) in the bridge have achieved the ideal charge transportation, more thiophenes may not be conducive to improving the electronic transmission, which may be closely related to the oligomers' crystal morphology.34 At the same time, their μh values were also calculated which are summarized in Table S5 (ESI†). Comparing the data in Table 5 (μe) with Table S5 (ESI;† μh), μe is almost an order of magnitude larger which suggests that the majority of the carriers were electrons in three of the oligomers. These charge transport results indicate that those oligomers are effectively acceptor materials for OSCs.34 All the results indicate that increasing the electron withdrawing ability of the electron deficient unit for NDI-based oligomers can enhance the electrochemical properties, optical properties and charge transport properties (especially the oligomer of NDI-2T3DCRD).
Recently, Deng et al. have achieved a significant breakthrough in the quantitative prediction of charge mobility using a first-principles simulation.43 To thoroughly investigate the anisotropy of the carrier (electron) transport and more accurately predict the charge transport properties in the single crystals of oligomers, NDI-2T3DCRD was selected to be used to calculate the intermolecular interactions and solid state packing, which were performed using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation functional115,116 and the general gradient approximation117,118 with polarized function (DNP basis set) using the DMoL3 and Polymorph module within the Materials Studio 7.0 software package.119–121 According to many reports by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre,122–124 crystal structure prediction has made significant breakthrough. In this work, it was predicted that the single crystal of NDI-2T3DCRD with the addition of alkyl side chains which may influence the crystal morphology of oligomers, may have a more real and comprehensive charge transport property than the face-to-face stacking. The single crystal structure of NDI-2T3DCRD shows a monoclinic primitive lattice with a space group of P21 and unit cell dimensions of a = 11.0608 (27) Å, b = 26.6718 (77) Å, c = 13.2400 (98) Å, α = 90°, β = 60.877 (06)°, and γ = 90° (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  Molecular packing of NDI-2T3DCRD in a unit cell. 
By building the super cell, the core molecule in a cell is selected, which may represent the electronic transmission paths as much as possible to calculate the electronic transportation properties by modifying the super cell. The modified super cell is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the centroids distances from the core molecule to the ambient molecules were marked, the charge transport properties transfer was calculated from the center molecule (marked with a rose red color) to adjacent molecule of each molecule, respectively, which was preformed using ADF.
The results are listed in Table 6, and the average values are 5.71 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1. Comparing them with the value for the face-to-face stacking calculation obtained using the Gaussian software in Table 5, the quantitative prediction of charge mobility using Materials Studio is smaller. This indicates that the latter technique can simulate the charge transfer path more realistically, which will make a great contribution to the charge transmissions.

3.4 The blend of active layer in bulk heterojunction solar cells
To further investigate the blend of active layers in BHJ solar cells, the P3HT/Acceptor (including NDI-2T3Me and NDI-2T3DCRD) blend solar cell was explored in a vacuum with corresponding functional and basis sets based on optimization. It is well known that the most impressive OSC device parameters are open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc) and FF. This may be ascribed to the fact that the photovoltaic PCE of the PSCs is proportional to Voc, Jsc and FF. Just as in eqn (16):83 
(16)where Pin is the power density of the incident solar light, and η is the PCE. Both the device models and the dynamic Monte Carlo simulation results show that η is dramatically sensitive to the charge carrier mobility and the nanostructure morphology.83
Voc is the maximum voltage available, when the external electric current is zero, which is in proportion to the energy level difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor.74,83 Jsc is the current density through the circuit when the applied voltage is zero, which is important for the further development of the efficiency of OSCs.83 According to eqn (4), the Jsc and IQE depend mainly on the light intensity, mobility, and morphology of the active layer, excition diffusion and dissociation at the D/A interface, and charge collection on the electrodes.125–128 In addition, FF as one of three main parameters of PCE, is mainly influenced by series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh).129,130 Rs can be reduced by enhancing the carrier mobility as described by the report by Gupta et al.,129 and the FF of OSC devices will be enhanced dramatically under that condition. The higher FF results from the higher parallel resistance and lower series resistance.131 However, accurate prediction of FF (Rs and Rsh) in OSC devices is still an ongoing challenge. Based on the previous analysis, Jsc is one of the most important parameters affecting the PCE of OSC devices. Furthermore, it can be seen that the light absorption range and intensity of the active layer have an important impact on Jsc on the basis of eqn (4) and (5). Therefore, analyzing the light absorbing performance (such as light absorption intensity and range) of the active layer is necessary, because the Jsc value is always directly dominated by the optical properties for the OSC.
In general, there are a lot of possible configurations in modeling any three-dimensional organic conductor because of the multitude of donor/acceptor stacking paths. To date, many studies reported that the face-to-face stacking model is beneficial to the improvement of intermolecular electronic coupling. Furthermore, the computational cost is quite high and time consuming when all of the configurations are considered. The aim of this work was only to qualitatively evaluate the light absorbing performance of the active layers, so only the ideal face-to-face model of donor/acceptor active layers was taken into account by calculating the scatter diagrams of electrostatic potential (Fig. S4†), which consists of a polymer (P3HT) donor and oligomer acceptor. The optical parameters (see Table 7) of these donor/acceptor active layers are calculated with the TD-BMK/6-311G** method in chloroform solvent, based on the optimized ground state structures at the PBE0/6-311G** level (the different plane spatial structures of the P3HT/Acceptor based on the optimized geometry are shown in Fig. S5; ESI†). The absorption spectra of these active layers (HBW = 2686 cm−1) and the donor P3HT are presented in Fig. 3.

 Fig. 3  The absorption spectra of P3HT/NDI-2T3Me and P3HT/NDI-2T3DCRD blend films in chloroform. 
As can be seen in Table 7 and Fig. 3, the NDI-2T3DCRD has a stronger and wider light absorption in the visible region (400–750 nm) than NDI-2T3Me, which may be more perfectly complementary with P3HT. Thus, the active layer P3HT/NDI-2T3DCRD has red-shifted and has stronger light absorption in comparison with P3HT/NDI-2T3Me, which may make full use of sunlight. The main transitions of P3HT/NDI-2T3Me and P3HT/NDI-2T3DCRD are HOMO → LUMO+1 and HOMO → LUMO+3, respectively. Just as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the distribution of HOMO is on the donor (P3HT) segment and the distribution of LUMO is on the core electron deficient units (A1) of the acceptor. The electron density difference plots (see Table S6; ESI†) can also be used to describe the phenomenon of electronic transitions that are assigned to π → π* transition. As a consequence, acceptors with excellent light absorbing properties can markedly improve the light absorbing performance of the donor/acceptor active layers. Finally, the results indicate that the introduction of the DCRD unit to replace the Me unit in oligomers can markedly improve the light harvesting performances of the active layers. This could noticeably enhance the Jsc values of the OSCs.
Furthermore, the calculated total densities of states and projected densities of states (see Table 8) elaborate which fragments are involved in the electronic transition orbital of the active layers. As shown in Table 8, the main electronic transitions of all the donor/acceptor active layers in the visible region correspond to HOMO to LUMO, HOMO to LUMO+1, HOMO−2 to LUMO, and so on. According to Tables 7 and 8, it can be seen that not only the donors take part in the electronic transition absorption of the active layers but also the acceptors are clearly involved in them. Therefore, the optical absorption performance of the acceptor is very important for the improvement of the light absorbing performance of the donor/acceptor active layers in OSCs.

4 Conclusions
In summary, the properties of electronic and optical absorption of NDI-based oligomers acceptors (NDI-2T1DCRD—NDI-2T4DCRD) and their performances in OSC applications have been discussed with reference to quantum-chemical calculations and Marcus theory. As can be seen from the calculated results, increasing the electron withdrawing ability of electron deficient units not only extends the intra-molecular π conjugation and yields a stronger and broader light absorption in the visible and NIR, but also enhances the exciton separation efficiency at the donor/acceptor interface and the electron mobility. Particularly, the NDI-2T3DCRD has a promising charge transfer rate (5.71 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1) and can effectively complement the light absorption of donor (P3HT) materials. This result indicates that adjusting the electron withdrawing ability of terminal groups in NDI-based type oligomers acceptors is a feasible approach to improve the electronic and optical properties of the NDI-based oligomers' performance. It is concluded that the NDI-2T3DCRD may be a good candidate for acceptor materials in OSC applications and gives a design guideline for designing efficient oligomer acceptors for OSC applications.
