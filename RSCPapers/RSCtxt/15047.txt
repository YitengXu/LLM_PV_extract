    , Accepted 16th March 2017First published on 30th March 2017AbstractThe dielectric properties of three pairs of organic semiconductors that contain increasing numbers of cyclopentadithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole moieties (monomer, dimer and polymer) were studied and compared. The materials in each pair differed in the nature of the ‘solubilizing groups’, which are either alkyl- or glycol-based. At low frequencies (<MHz), dielectric constants of up to ∼9 were obtained for the glycolated materials. In addition, the optical- (high-) frequency dielectric constants for the glycolated dimer and polymer were 4.6 and 4.2 respectively, which are the highest values reported thus far for non-ionic organic semiconductors. The external and internal quantum efficiencies (EQE and IQE) of homojunction (i.e., single component) solar cells comprising the dimer and polymer glycolated materials both showed measurable improvements at wavelengths close to their optical gap when compared with the alkylated equivalents. The improvement is suggestive of an increase in the charge generation efficiency, potentially facilitated by the high optical-frequency dielectric constant.
Introduction
Organic semiconductors typically used in solar cells generally have inherently low dielectric constants (εr < 4) both at low- and optical- (high-) frequencies leading to the exciton formed upon photon absorption having a relatively large binding energy (several hundred meV).1 As a consequence, the two component heterojunction architecture (either linear or bulk) comprised of materials with different ionization potentials and electron affinities is the predominant geometry used to facilitate exciton splitting and charge generation. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) delivers the highest power conversion efficiencies in solution-processed devices, but the all-important ‘blend-morphology’ is very sensitive to processing conditions and change as a function of time. Furthermore, the exciton binding energy leads to the situation whereby there needs to be an energy difference between the electron affinities (EAs) and/or ionization potentials (IPs) of each component in the heterojunction (whether bulk or linear) to drive the charge separation process, and this leads to an energy loss during charge transfer resulting in a reduced open circuit voltage (Voc). Homojunction organic solar cells (which are generally defined as a ‘single semiconductor solar cell’) have the potential to be more easily manufactured and stable. However, they generally have much lower power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than heterojunction devices as the exciton binding energy cannot be overcome by the built in electric field or thermal energy at room temperature.2 That is, only a small fraction of absorbed photons lead to free charges being formed or collected, due to a lack of screening of the electron–hole electric field, and most excitons simply decay back to the ground state. A further feature of homojunction solar cells is that there is a strong energy dependence on the internal quantum efficiency (IQE).3 At energies close to the optical gap, the IQE is lower than at higher energies where excess energy, the energy difference between the exciting photon and the optical gap, can partially overcome the exciton binding energy and lead to an increase in charge generation.4 For example, a homojunction solar cell comprising an active layer of poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-{2-ethylhexyl}-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT) has an IQE of around 0.1% near the optical gap of ≈1.5 eV (based on the onset of absorption) rising to near 1.5% at energies >2 eV above the optical gap (see Fig. S1, ESI†). Both of these IQEs are significantly less than that measured in BHJ devices, even those with modest efficiency.5–7
In order for a homojunction device comprising a single light absorbing organic semiconductor layer to be efficient it must have (i) a broad spectral absorption window and high extinction coefficient to maximize the light absorbed in the thinnest possible junction; (ii) high and balanced charge carrier mobilities for efficient charge extraction; and (iii) a low exciton binding energy for efficient charge separation. Molecular engineering has led to examples of requirements (i) and (ii)8–10 being satisfied, although ambipolar charge carrier transport (transport of electrons and holes) is the more difficult of the two to achieve in a single organic semiconductor. However, there are fewer studies on manipulating the exciton binding energy to enhance the generation of free charge carriers [point (iii)]. In the Wannier–Mott construct the exciton binding energy is proportional to the inverse square of the dielectric constant. It is also important to note that the dielectric constant can vary dramatically from low- to optical-frequencies and the relevant frequency for electron–hole Coulomb screening is very ‘semiconductor dependent’. That said, efficient homojunction devices have been achieved using high dielectric constant materials (εr > 10) such as inorganic semiconductors11 and more recently, organo-halide lead perovskites12,13 whereby photoexcitation leads directly to free charges. Koster et al. have carried out a theoretical study showing that if the organic semiconductor dielectric constant can be increased to ∼10 then it can potentially function in a predominantly non-excitonic regime leading to efficient single layer devices.14
There has been some effort made experimentally to enhance the dielectric constant of organic semiconductors. Materials used for energy storage applications, such as the hyperbranched copper phthalocyanine (Cu-Pc) polymers, exhibit low-frequency dielectric constants as high as 15 when tested in thin film devices,15,16 and other small molecule Cu-Pcs bearing ionic side chains exhibit εr as high as 106 when exposed to moisture.17 More recently it has been shown that the introduction of cyano groups, fluorine atoms, or oligo(ethylene oxide) (glycol) solubilizing groups can lead to an increase in the dielectric constant of fullerenes and polymer semiconductors.18–20 The materials containing glycol chains have been shown to have significantly enhanced low-frequency dielectric constants without any detrimental effects on the electrochemical properties or charge carrier mobility.21,22 Also blending a non-polymeric organic semiconductor with a high dielectric small molecule, camphoric anhydride, has been shown to more than double the low-frequency dielectric constant as measured in a thin film.23 However, when these high dielectric materials (and blended systems) were utilized in organic solar cells no significant enhancement of PCE was observed.19,23 For example, a recent report showed that fluorene- and cyclopentadithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole based electron accepting materials with polarizable glycol chains had large (up to ≈9) low-frequency dielectric constants and yet their performance was only slightly improved in relation to an alkylated equivalent when used in a solar cell blended with poly(3-n-hexylthiophene).24 A further important contribution with regard to dielectric constants is the work of Kraner et al. who studied the frequency dependence of the dielectric function of a ladder polymer and found that while there was little variance in the dielectric function between the far-IR and UV-visible regions, the in-plane and out-of-plane dielectric constants were markedly different, which could be important when considering charge transport in a device.25
In this article we describe the synthesis, physical, dielectric, optoelectronic, and device properties of a family of materials based on the cyclopentadithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole structural unit. In particular, we report a comparison of the dielectric constants (low- and optical-frequency) of a dimer (D) of a previously reported monomer (M)24 with the monomer itself, as well as a polymer (P) containing the same units. The structures of the materials are shown in Fig. 1 and in each case the materials bear either alkyl or glycol (denoted as A and G, respectively) solubilizing groups. We show that all the glycolated materials have a higher low-frequency dielectric constant than their alkylated counterparts and that the optical-frequency dielectric constant is larger for materials with a more extended chromophore. Finally, we report that the increased optical-frequency dielectric constant results in higher internal and external quantum efficiencies (IQE and EQE) near the optical gap in homojunction photovoltaic cells.

In each case the synthesised materials are defined by G or A, depending on whether they are glycolated or alkylated, respectively. For example, the glycolated monomer is defined as MG. Commercial PCPDTBT is the alkylated comparative material for PG. 
Results
Synthesis
The synthetic route to DG, DA and PG is shown in Scheme 1. The syntheses of the starting aldehydes 1a and 1b have been previously reported.241a and 1b were chemoselectively iodinated at the free α position (position 6) of the cyclopentadithiophene using iodine monochloride to give the iodinated materials 2a (59%) and 2b (67%). The iodides were then dimerized under Stille conditions to afford the dimer aldehydes 3a (31%) and 3b (56%) as blue powders. Knoevenagel condensation of 3a and 3b with malononitrile in the presence of pyridine yielded the final compounds DG and DA as purple powders in yields of 78% and 97%, respectively.

Conditions and reagents: (i) ICl, THF, −78 °C, 45 min; (ii) bis(tri-n-butyltin), Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, toluene, 100 °C, 16 h; (iii) malononitrile, pyridine, toluene, 65 °C, 30 min; (iv) NBS, THF, rt, 16 h; (v) 4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, K2CO3 (2.0 M), Aliquat 336, Pd(PPh3)4, toluene, 100 °C, 16 h, then phenyl boronic acid, then bromobenzene. 
For the glycolated polymer synthesis, 424 was brominated to afford 5 in a 29% yield. 5 was found to have a strong affinity for water when in deuterated chloroform, which was evident in the proton NMR spectrum (Fig. S16, ESI†), where resonances for both bound and free water were observed, although those associated with 5 without bound water were the strongest signals. 5 was then polymerized under Suzuki conditions with 4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole. It is important to note that the final precipitation used in the purification sequence used methanol to effect the removal of bound potassium ions from the polymer, as these had the potential to affect the low-frequency εr. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) analysis of PG (in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 130 °C) showed that it had an w of 29 kDa and an n of 26 kDa. It should be noted that Lumtec quote an w of 7–20 kDa for the PCPDTBT used in this study.
Thermal properties
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine whether the materials underwent any thermal transitions (Table 1, Fig. 2 and Fig. S19, ESI†). In the first heating cycle at a scan rate of 100 °C min−1 the as precipitated DG exhibited three thermally induced melts at ∼150 °C, ∼163 °C and ∼221 °C suggesting that different polymorphs were present. On cooling, crystallization was observed to occur at ∼147 °C, which was slow on the experimental timescale as it continued at a similar temperature in the subsequent heating cycle. Subsequent cycles showed a single melt at ∼221 °C, which corresponded to the melting point observed using a melting point apparatus (see Experimental section) and indicates that after the initial melt and recrystallization a single polymorph is formed. Slowing the scan rate to 20 °C min−1 did not induce crystallization of a different polymorph. In the first heating cycle of DA a thermally induced crystallization was observed at ∼206 °C, and in the second heating cycle this feature was significantly less pronounced. In all scans a bulk melt was observed at 233 °C, which is higher than the melt observed for DG (221 °C). A very broad crystallization was also observed in the cooling cycles for DA at ∼157 °C. PG (Fig. S26, ESI†) did not display any thermal transitions in the range measured (−50–250 °C) at scan rates between 20 °C min−1 and 300 °C min−1. The commercial PCPDTBT had two endothermic transitions in the first heating cycle (at ∼133 °C and ∼143 °C), which were not observed in the subsequent heating cycle. No thermal transition corresponding to crystallization was observed (Fig. S19, ESI†).

Photophysical and electronic properties
The solution and film UV-visible spectra of DG, DA, PG, and PCPDTBT (alkylated analogue of PG) are shown in Fig. 3 and the key film spectral data is summarised in Table 2. The solution spectra of the dimers containing the alkyl or glycol chains have similar long wavelength peaks indicating that the nature of the solubilizing group has little impact on the absorption properties of the material, which is in agreement with previous findings.24PG was found to have its onset and peak absorption at a longer wavelength than the commercial PCPDTBT, which could be due to the former having a longer chromophore conjugation length or the two materials having different conformations in solution. The two materials however had similar extinction coefficients in solution (see Fig. S20, ESI† in which we also present the relevant extinction coefficients [k]). The notable feature of the spectra of all of the dimers and polymers is that in going from solution to the solid-state the low energy absorption maximum moves to slightly longer wavelengths and there is also a red shift in the onset of the absorption. The observed shift to longer wavelengths of the absorption in the film is likely due to a combination of planarization of the chromophore as well as aggregation, with the latter indicated by the Mie scattering at the longest wavelengths. A further interesting feature is that for both the dimer and the polymer the absorption is most red shifted for the glycolated material in going from solution to the solid-state. This observation is in agreement with a report in the literature, where Meng et al.26 have demonstrated that replacement of alkyl chains with glycol chains leads to a red shifted absorption maximum, which they ascribed to closer intermolecular packing of the glycolated material. Although DG, DA, and PG are weakly luminescent (see Fig. S21, ESI†), their photoluminescence maxima are >1100 nm, and hence difficult to reliably measure. We have therefore estimated the optical gap to be ∼1.2 eV for all three materials from the intercept of a line drawn from the low energy side of the strongest long wavelength absorption of the film (see Fig. S22, ESI†). The narrow optical gap and broad absorption of these materials provide a basis for efficient photon harvesting in a homojunction device.

To confirm that the glycolated materials were packing more closely than the alkylated analogues, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) (Fig. S23, ESI†) and X-ray reflectometry (XRR) measurements (Fig. S24, ESI†) were carried out on thin-films deposited on silicon substrates spin-coated from chloroform, with the results summarized in Table 1. Thin films of the dimers exhibited diffraction peaks at higher 2θ in the as-cast state. The diffraction peak at 2θ = 24.5° for DG gave an average π–π stacking distance with a lattice spacing of around 3.62 Å. DA also displayed a broader π–π stacking peak centred around 22.2° suggesting a less ordered system with a larger average lattice spacing of around 4.00 Å. The GIXRD spectrum of DA also shows a second weak peak centred around 5.29° (lattice spacing = 16.7 Å) consistent with ordering of the octyl chains. There were no prominent peaks at low 2θ in the GIXRD spectrum of DG that would correspond to ordering of the glycol chains in the as-cast dimer films. The dimer films were relatively stable to aging, with both DA and DG having the same GIXRD spectrum 3 weeks after the films were cast. The GIXRD spectra of PCPDTBT showed a peak at 22.7°, which again was attributed to π–π stacking in the solid state (Fig. 4c) and corresponds to a lattice spacing of 3.91 Å. Upon glycolation a 1.8° shift to 24.5° of the peak was observed, which corresponded to a reduction in the lattice spacing of around 0.4 Å between polymer chains. PG also had a clear and strong peak at 6.49° corresponding to a spacing of 13.6 Å, which is due to the interdigitation of the glycol side-chains. Thus the GIXRD results indicate that glycolation leads to closer π–π stacking distances, which will enable stronger inter-molecular interactions. The thin film densities calculated from the X-ray scattering length densities corroborate the GIRXD results. DG is more dense than DA, and PG is significantly more dense than PCPDTBT (Table 1 and Fig. S23, ESI†).

The homojunction device thicknesses were between 70–100 nm in all cases. 
The electrochemical properties of the materials in solution were measured using a combination of cyclic (CV) and differential pulse (DPV) voltammetry (Fig. S25, ESI† shows the cyclic voltammograms of the oxidations and first reductions) and the IPs of films were determined using Photoelectron Spectroscopy in Air (PESA) (Table 2). DG and DA both exhibited two oxidations (at 0.2/0.9 V and 0.2/0.4 V, respectively), with the latter being more chemically reversible, as well as two reductions (at −1.1/−1.5 V and −0.8/−1.2 V, respectively). PG exhibited a chemically reversible reduction. However, for PG it was difficult to identify both the cathodic and anodic peaks for the reduction in the CV measurement and we therefore utilized DPV to determine the reduction potential, which was −1.5 V. PCPDTBT exhibited a chemically reversible oxidation at 0.1 V and a chemically reversible reduction at −1.8 V. Finally, the thin film IPs for DG and DA were −5.0 eV and −5.3 eV, respectively, and those for PG and PCPDTBT were determined to be −4.8 eV and −5.0 eV, respectively. Therefore, for both the dimer and polymer structures the solid-state IP of the glycolated material was less than the alkylated equivalent indicating that in the film it is easier to remove an electron from the glycolated compounds.
Mobility measurements were carried out on the dimers and polymers using the diode structure ITO/MoOx/semiconductor/MoOx/Ag for hole only devices and ITO/Al/semiconductor/Al for electron only devices. The data is summarized in Table 3, which also includes the results of the monomers for comparison. The mobilities were calculated by applying the Mott–Gurney law to the current–voltage curves and by considering the Poole–Frenkel law for the field dependence of charge carrier mobility. We previously reported for the monomers that there was an order of magnitude difference in the electron mobilities, with that of the glycolated MG being higher than that of the alkylated MA.24 A similar trend was observed for the dimer and polymer pairs. The glycolated material DG has an electron mobility two orders of magnitude larger than its alkylated equivalent DA (Table 3 and Table S26, ESI†). While the alkylated dimer shows strongly dispersive electron transport (as seen from its strongly field dependent mobility), the glycolated dimer exhibits insignificant field dependence, which is consistent with improved molecular packing lowering the disorder and trap states. In addition, PG has a hole mobility two orders of magnitude larger than PCPDTBT (Table 3 and Table S26, ESI†). For both the dimer and polymer pairs we attribute the improved mobility of the glycolated materials to the closer π–π stacking distance between backbones revealed by GIXRD, which would enhance intermolecular charge transport.

To finish the study on the electronic properties the dielectric constants were measured electrically at low-frequency from the electrical impedance spectrum and at high-frequency using a combination of spectroscopic reflectometry, transmission and ellipsometry. Diodes were prepared with the structure ITO/semiconductor/Ag for the low-frequency dielectric constant measurements, with films on fused silica and silicon used for the high-frequency measurements. It has been previously reported that the glycolated MG had a significantly larger low-frequency dielectric constant than the alkylated monomer, MA, while the high-frequency dielectric constant (Table 3 and Fig. 4a) of both materials was similar.24 In the case of DG we observed a similar improvement in the low-frequency dielectric constant in comparison to DA, as a result of the glycol polarization, but importantly we also observed an enhancement in the dielectric response in the high-frequency regime (Table 3 and Fig. 4b) where εhf increased from 3.7 to 4.6. To the best of our knowledge a high-frequency dielectric constant of 4.6 is the highest measured value reported for a non-ionic organic material to date (typically εhf is <4.0). The polymer PG shows similar behavior with an enhancement in the low-frequency dielectric constant relative to PCPDTBT, as well as a small, but not insignificant increase in the high-frequency dielectric constant (Table 3 and Fig. 4c). We note that we determined these high-frequency constants in the dispersion tail at ∼1 × 1014 Hz.
The glycol polarizations are expected to be too slow to contribute to the high-frequency dielectric response, therefore another mechanism must be in play for the glycolated dimer and polymer materials. According to the Clausius–Mossotti relation, the dielectric constant of a material can be related to its density, with an increase in density leading to a larger dielectric constant.27 However, a recent theoretical study reports that not only is the density important but the dielectric response of organics can be governed by a combination of factors including substrate coverage density, molecular tilt angle (with respect to the substrate surface), polarizability of the chromophore, and π-system planarity.28 At optical-frequencies the alkylated monomer, dimer, and polymer all have essentially the same εhf of around 3.7 in spite of them having significantly different chromophores. Hence, the larger εhf for the DG and PG is more likely to arise from the increased packing density. It is unclear at this stage why the εhf of DG is higher than that of PG.
Enhancement of homojunction solar cell performance
The final part of the study was to assess how the dielectric constant impacted homojunction device performance. The simple device structure consisted of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/organic semiconductor/Sm/Al. The thickness of the active layer was similar (70–100 nm) for each material so as to minimize differences arising from optical cavity effects. We first investigated the monomers MG and MA (Fig. 4d). Although the glycolated monomer MG has a high dielectric constant at low-frequencies, virtually no difference was seen in the EQEs of the two devices. However, the dimers showed significantly different behaviour with the EQE of the DA device only ∼1% at 800 nm, where the excess energy is negligible but the material absorbs strongly, whereas the glycolated DG had an EQE three times higher at the same wavelength (Fig. 4e). The DG device has a broad spectral range with a response between 300 nm and 1000 nm. The polymers exhibited similar behaviour in that PG performed better than PCPDTBT although the enhancement of the performance was less pronounced. At 800 nm, where both materials absorb strongly, the PCPDTBT-based device had an EQE that was three times less than the EQE of the PG cell, which was around 0.3%.
At first sight these EQEs appear rather low but it is important to note that organic semiconductors typically used in efficient BHJ cells are generally very poor (<1%) when used in homojunction devices, particularly around their optical gap. To illustrate this point Fig. 5a compares the EQE spectra of the glycolated DG and PG with their alkylated counterparts and several conventional donor and acceptor organic semiconductors. It can be seen that the glycolated DG with the largest high-frequency dielectric constant has the largest EQE compared to all the other materials in spite of the fact that some of them have higher charge carrier mobilities, e.g., DPP-DTT (2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1),10 PTB7 (10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1),29 and PC70BM (3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).30 In particular, for the non-glycolated conventional organic semiconductors the highest EQE is found at shorter wavelengths where the excess energy is greater than the exciton binding energy. The corollary to this for the non-glycolated materials is that the EQE approaches zero at wavelengths where the excess energy of the excitation is lower than the exciton binding energy (typically from the absorption edge to around the absorption peak). However, it is important to note that a higher EQE can arise from better absorption, charge generation, and/or transport/extraction and to disentangle these factors in the current study we determined the internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) of the devices.

(b) IQE spectra of DG and PG compared to their alkylated equivalents and several conventional organic semiconductors plotted versus the excess energy of the excitations. Whilst all low-dielectric-constant conventional materials show a rise at approximately the same excitation energy (corresponding to the exciton binding energy) the high-dielectric-constant polymer and dimer exhibit substantial charge generation at low excess energies. 
The IQE of a device provides information about the intrinsic charge generation properties as the influence of the variations in the absorption are eliminated.31 When the IQE is measured at a low enough light intensity, a good estimation of the charge generation quantum yield can be determined, as the bimolecular recombination losses are negligible. In the current case we used intensities of <1 mW cm−2, which is certainly within the low irradiation regime. Furthermore, we also checked that the measured EQEs were similar under standard monochromator illumination and attenuated with an OD1 neutral density filter in what amounts to a two point intensity dependent photocurrent measurement. All indications were that bimolecular recombination was largely absent. Fig. 5b shows the IQE of DG and PG in comparison to several other polymer semiconductors plotted against the excess energy (Eexcess). Overall, the IQE spectra are in agreement with what we observe for the EQEs. The glycolated DG and PG, which have the larger high-frequency dielectric constant, generally exhibit the higher IQEs across the energy range. However, the most important feature of the IQE data is that with conventional low-dielectric constant organic semiconductors the charge generation is extremely poor around the optical gap where Eexcess is low whereas for DG it is not. It can be seen in Fig. 5b that the largest charge generation (<2%) was observed for the low-dielectric materials only when Eexcess is much greater than the exciton binding energy (Eb), i.e., when Eexcess ≫ Eb. In each case for the low-dielectric materials there is a rise in the IQE when Eexcess is greater or equal to Eb. In fact, Deibel et al. have employed the onset of the large increase in IQE as a tool to approximate the exciton binding energy.32 For most of the low-dielectric materials in Fig. 5b the rise is observed to be at Eexcess ∼ 0.6 eV, which is consistent with the range of binding energies for typical organic semiconductors. In the case of the high-frequency dielectric constant dimer DG an IQE of 4% was observed at the low excess energy ∼0.3 eV. Although this may not be the absolute exciton binding energy of the dimer it does strongly suggest that a smaller amount of excess energy is needed to form free charges than for conventional materials. It is also worth noting that the IQE remains >4% over a broad range of energies, from 0.3–2.5 eV.
Conclusions
In summary, pairs of glycolated and alkylated monomers, dimers and polymers, have been studied with the aim of elucidating the structure-dielectric constant relationship. The glycolated dimer and polymer showed enhanced π–π stacking and improved charge carrier mobility in comparison to their alkylated counterparts. The dielectric constant of each material was measured over a range of frequencies and an enhancement in the low-frequency dielectric constant was observed for all of the glycolated materials due to the ability of the glycol chain to polarize in the low-frequency field. More interestingly, an enhancement in the high-frequency dielectric constant was observed for both DG and PG, with the former having the greater increase. The EQEs of the homojunction devices revealed the relationship between εhf and photocurrent generation: the higher εhf, the higher the EQE when compared to the alkylated equivalents, with DG, which has the largest optical-frequency dielectric constant having an IQE of 4% at low excess energies <0.3 eV. The results indicate that a lower exciton binding energy can be achieved by enhancement of the optical-frequency dielectric constant. The enhanced charge generation yield in the high εhf dimer DG was found to give a PCE of ∼0.3% in a homojunction device (Fig. S26, ESI†), which is larger than the typical PCE achieved with conventional organic semiconductors in homojunction cells (<0.1%). Since DG is predominantly electron transporting, it is expected that charge carrier extraction will be inefficient as the holes will be unable to reach the electrodes before recombining. Therefore, in order to enhance homojunction device efficiency further, ambipolar materials with higher high-frequency dielectric constants must be developed.

Poly[2,6-(4,4-bis[2-{2-methoxyethoxy}ethyl]-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PG). 
A mixture of 5 (0.278 g, 0.52 mmol) and 4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (0.20 g, 0.52 mmol) in toluene (4.5 mL) and aqueous potassium carbonate solution (1.04 mL, 2.0 M) was stirred at room temperature under argon. Aliquat 336 (1 drop) was added and the solution was subjected to three freeze–pump–thaw cycles, backfilling with argon. Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (0.006 g, 0.005 mmol) was added and the solution was heated in an oil bath held at 100 °C overnight. A solution of phenylboronic acid (0.025 g) in toluene (1 mL) was added, followed by bromobenzene (0.10 mL) 15 min later. After 30 min the solution was allowed to cool (∼10 min) before being added to a mixture of methanol and diethyl ether (1:1, ∼40 mL). The mixture was then cooled in a dry ice/acetone bath. The mixture was centrifuged (2000 rpm, 5 min) and the supernatant was decanted. The precipitate was collected via vacuum filtration and was washed with light petroleum spirit (∼30 mL). The precipitate was transferred to a Soxhlet thimble and was extracted with acetone (5 h), toluene (3 d), chlorobenzene (5 h) and chloroform (overnight). The solvent volume of the chloroform fraction was reduced to ∼20 mL in vacuo and the polymer was precipitated through the addition of light petroleum spirit (∼20 mL). The mixture was centrifuged (2000 rpm, 5 min) and the bulk of the supernatant was decanted to facilitate filtration. The precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration of the remaining mixture and was dissolved in chloroform (∼30 mL) and methanol (30 mL) was added. The mixture was centrifuged (2000 rpm, 5 min) and the bulk of the supernatant was decanted to facilitate filtration. The precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration of the remaining mixture and was dried in vacuo to afford PG as a shiny purple film (107 mg, 40%); λmax(dichloromethane)/nm 432, 761; λmax(film)/nm 431, 781; δH (400 MHz, CDCl3) 2.30–2.90 (8H, br, CH2), 3.10–4.40 (14H, br, CH2 and CH3), 7.80–8.30 (4H, br, CPDT H and BT H); Td(3%) = 260 °C, Td(5%) = 380 °C.

Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and specular X-ray reflectometry (XRR) measurements
Thin films were spin-coated onto 50 mm diameter silicon wafers. Prior to film deposition the wafers were cleaned with freshly prepared piranha solution (a 2:1 v/v mixture of 98% sulfuric acid and 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide – care) before they were ultrasonicated in acetone and 2-propanol for 10 min each and dried under a flow of nitrogen. All materials were spin coated at 1200 rpm for 2 min from a chloroform solution (10 mg mL−1). All GIXRD measurements and XRR measurements were performed on a Rigaku Smartlabs instrument with a 9 kW rotating anode (Cu) source. Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) was focussed onto the samples in a parallel beam through a 0.03 mm pre-collimation slit and detected with a HyPix-3000 hybrid pixel array detector. For GIXRD measurements the incidence angle of the parallel beam was fixed at 0.2°. Data points were recorded over a range of scattering angles (2θ) from 2.3°–40.0° in continuous scan mode every 0.05° at a scan rate of 2.5° min−1. Diffraction peaks were fitted as Gaussian functions and the peak centres determined using the multipeak fitting function built into the IgorPro analysis package. Specular XRR measurements were performed in a θ/θ configuration over a range of scattering angles (2θ) from 0.0–6.0° to give a Q-range of 0.00–0.43 Å−1 [Q = (4π/λ)sinθ]. Data points were recorded in continuous scan mode every 0.01° at a scan rate of 0.3° min−1 and a 2-bounce Ge(220) monochromator was used in the incident optics to improve Q-resolution. The XRR data collected were normalized to the maximum reflected beam intensity below the critical edge for analysis. The normalized XRR data were analyzed using the Motofit reflectometry analysis software and were modeled as a bulk organic layer with a thin interfacial layer in contact with a silicon substrate with a native oxide layer.33 The X-ray SLDs (i-SLDs) used to model the substrates in the fitting models were 20.1 × 10−6 Å−2 (4.7 × 10−7 Å−2) for silicon and 18.9 × 10−6 Å−2 (2.5 × 10−7 Å−2) for silicon dioxide. It should be noted that in some cases the substrate-interfacial layer had the same SLD as the bulk layer while in some cases it was of lower SLD.
Dielectric constant measurements
The dielectric constants at 20 Hz to ∼106 Hz were determined using an Agilent E4980A LCR meter at an amplitude of 10 mV by measuring the capacitance of the devices with known area (0.2 cm2) and thickness (>1 μm). A device structure of ITO/semiconductor/Ag was used to measure the capacitance. The shunt resistances of all of the samples tested were >1 MΩ at low frequencies indicating negligible density of structural defects. The real part of the refractive index (n) was determined from Kramers–Kronig transformations of the extinction coefficient (k) and base-lined with n (λ >1000 nm) extracted from the spectroscopic ellipsometry data collected on a J. A. Woollam VUV-VASE ellipsometer. Dielectric constants in the high frequency regime (∼1014 Hz) were converted from the optical constants (n and k). Finally, the real part of the dielectric constant was calculated using n and k.
Device fabrication and testing
15 Ω sq−1 indium tin oxide coated glass substrates (Kintec) patterned by photolithography were pre-cleaned with Alconox (detergent) solution and a soft cloth before being sonicated in sequence with Alconox, de-ionized water, acetone and 2-propanol for 10 minutes each. Each substrate was 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm with 6 pixels, each of area 0.2 cm2. The organic semiconductors were spin-coated from chloroform solution onto the cleaned substrates at a spin speed of 1000 rpm to give films with thicknesses of 70–100 nm. The monomers and dimers were spin-coated from solutions of concentration 15 mg mL−1 while the polymers had a concentration of 10 mg mL−1. The solution preparation and fabrication were carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere (O2 < 1 ppm, H2O < 1 ppm) at ∼20 °C. The thicknesses of the films were measured using a Veeco Dektak150 profilometer. Finally, the devices were completed by depositing samarium (1 nm)/aluminium (100 nm) by thermal evaporation under a 10−6 mbar vacuum.
Current–voltage and quantum efficiency measurements
Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were acquired for un-encapsulated devices in a nitrogen-filled glovebox using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit and Agilent B1500A semiconductor analyzer. The simulated Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) illumination was provided by an Abet Sun 2000 Solar Simulator. The intensity used throughout was ∼1000 W m−2 (the exact number being used for efficiency calculations), as determined by an NREL-calibrated silicon reference cell. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and the near normal incidence reflectance of the devices were recorded with a PV Measurements Inc. QEX7 system, which was calibrated with a NREL certified photodiode without light bias. Mobilities were measured through current–voltage measurements of unipolar diodes and applying Mott–Gurney's law with Poole–Frenkel mobility (see ESI† for details). For electron and hole mobilities the device structures were ITO/Al (10 nm)/semiconductor/Al and ITO/MoOx (5 nm)/semiconductor/MoOx (5 nm)/Ag, respectively. To avoid Ohm's law limited current induced by the sheet resistance of the ITO the device area was reduced to 0.01 cm2 for these unipolar measurements.
