Photocurrent and photovoltage decays are also measured under the same experimental conditions. A local electric field causing a Stark shift of the D149 absorption band is found to strongly influence the transient spectra and kinetics. The presence of electrons in titania has a major contribution to the Stark shift and the effect disappears over many time scales with an average rate of 5 × 103 s−1. This is much slower than the decay of the oxidized dye (2 × 106 s−1) but, on the other hand, significantly faster than the decay of electrons in titania nanoparticles (3 × 102 s−1 at standard AM1.5 irradiation and open circuit conditions). Possible explanations of this phenomenon are discussed. Electron recombination from the titania conduction band to the oxidized dyes proceeds at an average rate of 2–16 × 104 s−1, depending on the excitation energy density, and does not influence the efficiency of dye regeneration.
1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are considered to be one of the most promising photovoltaic devices challenging conventional silicon technologies for sunlight conversion.1,2 The charge separation efficiency, which determines the DSSC performance, is achieved by electron injection from the light-excited dye into a metal oxide nanostructure followed by dye regeneration with the electrolyte and electron transport through the nanostructure network to the electrode. Currently, the best reported efficiencies of DSSCs reach 12% using ruthenium complexes or zinc porphyrins as sensitizers.3,4 As alternatives, numerous metal-free organic dyes have been proposed,2 and among them, one of the most promising performances was obtained for indoline D149 dye (Fig. 1A).5 In the classical DSSC architecture, with a TiO2 nanoparticle network and iodine-based liquid electrolyte, the best sunlight conversion efficiency with this dye is 9%.6 Besides this high value, D149 showed remarkably promising properties when used with less volatile ionic liquids and solid state electrolytes.6–10 Moreover, this dye was also successfully employed in DSSCs with ZnO nanoparticles and nanotubes.9,11,12
 Fig. 1  (A) Chemical structure of D149 dye. (B) Transient absorption spectrum of D149/ACN measured 1 μs after excitation with 300 μJ cm−2 pulse at 532 nm. The figure also presents the experimental stationary absorption of D149/ACN (AEXP) normalized to a negative bleach signal and the contributions of ΔAStark are calculated, according to eqn (2), from the first derivative of the experimental absorption or the first derivative of Gaussian fit (AFIT) to the S0 → S1 absorption band. 
Recently, a new phenomenon called the local Stark effect, observed in spectroscopic studies of DSSCs, has been reported.13,14 It is connected to the changes of the dye absorption spectrum under an electric field created after electron injection present on the dye–titania interface. One of its most important implications can be an apparent existence of the dye bleach signal, under conditions where the dye is in the ground state.13 Such effects have been reported,15–17 and they can disturb the proper estimation of dye regeneration dynamics, and the partial charge separation quantum yield. Therefore, detailed understanding of the local Stark effect is crucial for the correct use of spectroscopic tools in solar cell optimization.
More specifically, the changes in the spectrum of D149 interacting with the semiconductor surface due to local electric field were observed by spectroelectrochemical methods13,18 and photo-induced absorption studies.8,13 Theoretical calculations for D149 interacting with TiO2 clusters showed that the major spectral changes are due to the presence of oxidized dye molecules (present after electron injection) that induce the local electric field effect on the adjacent neutral dyes.19 In the same work, the authors predict a minor contribution to the Stark shifts from the injected electrons delocalized in titania.19 Very recently, ultrafast transient absorption studies of D149 interacting with ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles revealed that the transient Stark shift occurs with a time constant of 20 ps, significantly slower than the electron injection dynamics (time constants up to 250 fs).20
Therefore, in order to have better insight into the microscopic origins of the local Stark effect we have performed transient absorption studies for longer time domains (ns–ms) on the complete solar cells made of D149, together with the transient photocurrent and transient photovoltage studies of the same samples under the same experimental conditions. We believe that the obtained results are valid not only for the particularly important and widely use D149 sensitizers, but for a large class of metal-free dyes used in DSSCs.
2 Experimental
The solar cells were prepared with D149 dye (Sigma–Aldrich) and highly-transparent titania nanoparticle paste (Ti-Nanoxide HT, Solaronix SA) containing anatase nanocrystalline particles about 10 nm in diameter. A layer of paste was coated on the FTO electrode using the “doctor blade” technique between two parallel adhesive Scotch tapes. The film on the glass was heated at 450 °C to fabricate a TiO2 layer of about 5 μm thickness. After that, the film was immersed in a 3 × 10−5 M solution of D149 in dichloromethane (spectroscopic grade >99.5%, Aldrich), and kept at room temperature for about 1 h. The platinised counter electrode was obtained by spreading a Pt-based solution (Platisol T, Solaronix SA) on FTO glass and heating at 450 °C. To make a complete solar cell, the counter electrode was assembled with a thermal adhesive film (25 μm Surlyn, Meltronix, Solaronix SA) that acts as separator and sealing element. The reference samples (D149/ACN) were filled with acetonitrile (ACN, spectroscopic grade >99.5%, Aldrich) while the functioning solar cells were filled with commercial liquid electrolyte (EL, Iodolyte AN-50, Solaronix SA) containing the I−/I3− redox couple ([I2] = 50 mM), ionic liquid, lithium salt and pyridine derivative in ACN solution.
The steady-state UV-visible absorption spectra were measured with a UV-VIS-550 (Jasco) spectrophotometer. The absorbance value at the maximum of the S0 → S1 band (520 nm) was around 1.5.
The samples were studied in a nanosecond flash photolysis setup based on a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser and a 150 W xenon arc lamp as the excitation and the probing light sources, respectively.21 The excitation wavelength was 532 nm and energy densities of laser pulses from 12 to 300 μJ cm−2 were used. Time-resolved transient absorption spectra were constructed by fitting the kinetics in the range from 400 to 800 nm. Usually 100–200 accumulations were averaged to get transient absorption kinetics. A digital oscilloscope was also used to measure the photovoltage and photocurrent transients in the same excitation conditions as in the transient absorption studies, and the probing xenon lamp light with proper color filters was used to simulate the bias irradiation of the standard sunlight AM1.5 (1 Sun). The filter cutting the UV part below 420 nm was used and we have checked that the xenon lamp power density was about 50 mW cm−2 at the sample in the spectral range from 420 to 700 nm (D149 does not absorb beyond 700 nm) with the flat intensity. In the same spectral range the power density for AM1.5 irradiation is about 40 mW cm−2, so our xenon lamp irradiation conditions are similar to that of 1 Sun.
The solar cells under illumination of 1 Sun gave an open circuit voltage VOC = 550 mV and short circuit current ISC = 4 mA cm−2. The ISC is significantly smaller than the best reported (ISC = 20 mA cm−2),6 which is probably due to smaller absorbance of our samples (to enable enough transparency of the sample for the spectroscopic studies) and the lack of using any disaggregating agent (such agents can improve the electron injection efficiency). The voltage is also slightly smaller than the best reported (VOC = 650 mV)6 because the Fermi level is lower for a smaller number of injected electrons.
3 Results and discussion
The results of the D149 solar cell filled with neat acetonitrile (D149/ACN) will be first presented. Such a sample is usually used as a reference system in which the observed dynamics are exclusively related to the electron recombination between the semiconductor nanoparticles and the oxidized dyes. Fig. 1B shows the transient absorption spectrum of D149/ACN measured 1 μs after excitation. The part between 480 and 550 nm was excluded due to the high absorbance of the sample and, therefore, insufficient transmission for the probing light. In general, the transient absorption signal ΔA in this time scale (the presence of the D149 triplet state can be neglected22) can consist of the following contributions: ΔA(λ) = Acation − Adye + Aelectrons + ΔAStark(1)where Acation is a positive absorption signal of oxidized dyes (dye radical cations present after electron injection, taking place at the fs and ps time scales10,20), Aelectrons is a positive absorption signal of electrons in the semiconductor (both free and trapped), Adye is a negative bleach signal (spectrum identical to the ground state absorption of the dye) and ΔAStark describes the spectral changes induced by the local Stark effect. Although the presence of the trapped electrons band is possible in the investigated range,23 a clear indication of Aelectrons is not observed in our experiment, probably due to their relatively small absorption coefficient and an overlap with other, stronger signals. The spectrum of Adye is shown in Fig. 1B, normalized to its possible negative contribution to the total ΔA signal. The positive absorption transients above 650 nm can be assigned to the D149 radical cation contribution, as similar features were observed in the spectroelectrochemical and photo-induced absorption experiments of D149.8,13,18,20 As shown in Fig. 1B, the maximum of the Acation band is at 680 nm, but the positive signal increases further to the red, which is a manifestation of the presence of another, stronger band of the D149 radical cation, observed and calculated between 1000 and 1500 nm.18,20 The contribution of the Stark effect, under the limitation to the first order process and small perturbation approximation, can be expressed as:13 (2)This formula accounts for the spectral shift of the frequency Δν of the transition related to the change of dipole moment Δμ under the presence of electric field E. Therefore, under the approximation given by eqn (2), the contribution of the Stark effect should have the spectral shape of the first derivative of the stationary absorption spectrum of the dye in the solar cell (dA/dν or λ2dA/dλ). Such a derivative is shown in Fig. 1B and it can be seen that it nicely reproduces the presence of a positive band below 500 nm in the transient absorption. This agrees also with the spectroelectrochemical and photo-induced absorption spectra observed previously for D149.13,18,20 It should be emphasized that the Stark effect perturbs the absorption spectrum of all sensitizers influenced by the local electric field, not only those that undergo photo-induced electron injection.14 Having this in mind, and knowing both the contribution of ΔAStark in the transient absorption signal and the total stationary absorption of the sample, the average shift of the absorption spectrum induced by the Stark effect can be estimated from eqn (2). For the conditions given in Fig. 1B, it is about 1 nm.
Being more precise, taking the derivative of the whole experimental stationary absorption is only valid if the changes in the dipole moment Δμ are the same for all transitions. As the calculations for D149 show, Δμ for the second electronic state transition (S0 → S2) is much smaller and even opposite to Δμ of the first one (S0 → S1).13 Therefore, for comparison we fitted the absorption spectrum with the sum of Gaussian functions and the derivative of only the first transition, was taken as ΔAStark, which is shown in Fig. 1B. This derivative better accounts for the existence of positive ΔA signal below 440 nm. To complicate the picture even more, the bands of radical cation also contribute to the positive transient absorption signal below 500 nm. The existence of such bands was predicated by calculations, and they were observed in electrochemical measurements of D149 in neat solvents, where no Stark effect can be present.20 The amplitude of the positive feature around 450 nm is roughly two times larger for D149 on titania than in neat solvents,20 so the contribution of Acation and ΔAStark signals is comparable in this spectral part, as will be also confirmed below.
In the case of the D149/ACN sample (without redox couple) the only present process is electron recombination from the titania conduction band to the dye radical cation, yielding the neutral form of the dye in the ground state. It leads to the simultaneous decay of all transient signals given by eqn (1). Therefore, as expected, the normalized kinetics at wavelengths corresponding to different bands are the same (Fig. S1 in ESI†). The dynamics of electron recombination are characteristically stretched over many time scales and show a dependence on the photon flux density of the excitation light. Such behaviour is predicted by the model in which electron transport within the particle is determined by the trap-limited diffusion (injected electron jumps between surface trap sites until it reaches a radical cation) and the process becomes faster for larger number of injected electrons in the particle.24–26Fig. 2A presents the exemplary kinetics measured at the bleach region (620 nm) for different pump fluences from 12 to 300 μJ cm−2. The fitted function is a stretched exponential one given by the following expression: ΔA(t) = Ae−(t/τ)β,(3)where τ is the characteristic time and β is the dispersion parameter (0 < β < 1; lower β values mean more stretched decay). Table 1A collects the fitted parameters, together with the average rate of the decay calculated as:27,28 (4)where Γ is the mathematical gamma function. Similar parameters were obtained when the decay of the radical cation band (at 680 nm) was monitored for corresponding excitation energies (Fig. 2B and Table 1B). As can be seen from Fig. 2 and Table 1, the average recombination rate decreases from 10–16 × 104 s−1 at 300 μJ cm−2 to 2–4 × 104 s−1 at 50 μJ cm−2. For our solar cells, the latter pump pulse energy density corresponds to an average injection of about one electron per titania nanoparticle. Below that value the normalized recombination kinetics do not change (compare the transients at 50 and 12 μJ cm−2 in Fig. 2A), in line with the reported behavior for other systems.29

In order to compare the effect of nanosecond pulse and continuous light excitation, we simulated the conditions of different irradiation intensity by modifying a bias light from the same xenon lamp used for probing. Fig. 3 and Table 1C show such an effect with the pump pulse at 50 μJ cm−2 when probed at the bleaching band (620 nm). The case of 1 Sun bias is realized, as explained in the experimental section, with a color filter absorbing UV part of the spectrum (<420 nm) and the xenon lamp was used without flash. Exchanging the filter with the one blocking most of the probing light overlapping with the absorption band of D149 (<605 nm) resulted in the approximated conditions of 0.1 Sun (calculation based on the ratio between the absorbed light intensity with and without such filter). It should be noted that without a flash of the white xenon light, the photomultiplier signal is increased at the oscilloscope by 5 kΩ input resistance, therefore the temporal range is limited to times longer than a few μs (due to extension of the RC time constant of the circuit). Finally, adding flash to the latter conditions resulted in about 40 times higher intensity, giving the bias light of about 4 Sun.

Interestingly, the effect of 1 Sun and 4 Sun bias illumination on the recombination dynamics (Fig. 3) is much smaller that could be expected from the pulse energy dependence (Fig. 2). The typical electron lifetime in DSSCs is a few milliseconds, and within this time the irradiation of 1 Sun delivers the energy density of a few hundred μJ cm−2 (corresponding to the average number of upto 10 electrons per nanoparticle30). Therefore, one could expect that the change in recombination rate between the conditions with and without 1 Sun bias (both under 50 μJ cm−2 laser excitation) is at least the same as for the increase from 50 to 300 μJ cm−2 laser pulse. As can be seen from Fig. 2 and 3 and Table 1, this is not true. This suggests that in the equilibrated conditions (with continuous irradiation), electrons occupy the trap sites of slower recombination probabilities than those occupied by electrons injected shortly after laser pulse. We will refer to this finding later.
The most important part of the studies is that of a complete functioning solar cell filled with electrolyte (D149/EL). In this case the presence of a redox couple causes a dye regeneration process, which for efficient cells should be much faster than electron recombination between TiO2 to the oxidized dye. As a result, the decay of Adye and Acation signals contributing to total transient absorption amplitude (given by eqn (1)) is expected to be faster than the decrease in the Aelectrons signal. As for the Stark effect contribution, ΔAStark, its decay should follow the dye regeneration kinetics if the local electric field is induced mainly by the dye radical cations, or it should be present much longer if it is connected with the presence of injected electrons in TiO2 nanoparticles. The representative results presented in Fig. 4 and Table 2 confirm the latter possibility for D149/EL. As can be seen, the fastest disappearance of the transient absorption signal is observed at a wavelength where the D149 radical cation band is exclusively present (680 nm). Although the initial part of the transient is affected by the negative contribution of dye spontaneous emission, the kinetics for times above 50 ns can be well-fitted with one exponential function with a time constant of 0.5 μs. The reciprocal of this time constant, k = 2 × 106 s−1, is much higher than the electron recombination average rates obtained even for the most intense pump pulse (Table 1). Therefore, the dye regeneration quantum yield is close to 100%, as expected for an efficient dye for DSSCs.

The absorption transients at shorter wavelengths decay to zero on a much longer time scale than that of dye regeneration measured at 680 nm. Therefore the signals at shorter wavelengths have to be connected with the injected electrons left in titania. The decay is even longer than the recombination process observed for the D149/ACN sample because the electrons cannot recombine to the oxidized dyes that have been already regenerated. The kinetics at 440 and 620 nm (representative for the positive and negative bands, respectively) were well-fitted with the sum of one exponential and stretched exponential function (Fig. 4 and Table 2): A(t) = A1e−(t/τ1) + A2e−(t/τ2)β(5)
The one exponential part with a time constant of 0.5 μs reflects the contribution of dye regeneration (the same as obtained at 680 nm), while the stretched exponential, slower decaying part with an average rate of 5 × 103 s−1 is due to the presence of electrons in the nanoparticle network. However, the latter cannot be simply due to absorption of trapped electrons because they should give no signal at 440 nm and a positive signal at 620 nm,23 opposite to the results for the D149/EL solar cell. Therefore, the observed slow decays are assigned exclusively to ΔAStark. At 620 nm, only about 20% of the total negative signal decay follows fast dye regeneration kinetics (due to ground state repopulation, Adye, accompanying dye regeneration) while the rest is due to D149 absorption band shift caused by the Stark effect. For positive transients at 440 nm, about half of the initial amplitude decreases quickly, reflecting the decay of the radical cation band, and another half of the signal decays slowly due to the Stark effect (Table 2). This is in line with the estimation of its contribution based on the analysis of transient absorption spectra discussed above. Moreover, the amplitudes of the fast decaying part at 440 and 680 nm are similar, which agrees with the spectra of D149 radical cation in inert solvent, without the presence of the Stark effect.20 The ratio of absolute amplitudes at 620 and 440 nm is 0.7 for the fast decaying part, while it is 3.4 for the slowly decaying part, assigned exclusively to ΔAStark (Table 2). These relations of the partial amplitudes indicate that, although some role of ΔAStark in the fast kinetics is possible, its contribution is increased for longer times, when the radical cations are not present. Therefore, for the complete DSSC of D149 it is electrons in the nanoparticle network rather than oxidized dyes that cause the presence of a local electric field shifting the sensitizers absorption spectra.
Importantly, so far the kinetics lasting longer than the lifetime of radical cation have been observed in the negative bleaching band for DSSCs.15,16 In this contribution we show the analogous prolongation of positive signals when the probing wavelength lies further to the blue, where dA/dλ changes its sign (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the transient absorption kinetics can be affected by the Stark effect in the whole spectral range corresponding to the stationary absorption. Therefore, the kinetics in the whole absorption range may not show the correct dye regeneration dynamics, and the proper estimation of the regeneration efficiency might be a challenging task. It is especially important for the dyes of solar cells absorbing in the red region, since the near infra-red spectral ranges are often affected by the absorption of electrons in the conduction band. In particular, the regeneration of oxidized D149 in DSSC should rather be probed at wavelengths longer than 650 nm31 than at the bleaching band,8 despite the stronger signal of the latter.
Next, the signal at 620 nm of D149/EL, containing both the dye regeneration and Stark effect dynamics, was investigated in the presence of different pump pulse intensities and compared at open (like all other kinetics) and closed circuit (with a 70 Ω resistance) conditions. After normalization, the kinetics were the same with 50 and 300 μJ cm−2 excitation energy densities (Fig. S2, ESI†). Even more interestingly, the decay was insensitive to the presence or absence of the connection between the electrodes (Fig. S3, ESI†). It is known that, after turning off the irradiation, the lifetime of injected electrons in the titania film of the DSSC is determined by the recombination with the electrolyte in the open circuit conditions, while in the short circuit case, the concentration of electrons decreases more rapidly due to additional charge collection by the electrode.2,29 We have proved above that the ΔAStark for the D149/EL sample is mainly due to the presence of electrons in titania, but it is the first indication that its dynamics do not simply follow the electrons population decay.
In order to prove it more explicitly, we performed the transient photovoltage (at open circuit conditions, electrodes connected to the digital oscilloscope through 1 MΩ impedance input) and transient photocurrent (at short circuit conditions, electrodes connected to the digital oscilloscope through 50 Ω impedance input) measurements with exactly the same solar cell sample and under the same beam geometry and excitation conditions as in the flash photolysis setup, using xenon probing light as the bias irradiation. Fig. 5 shows the representative decays after excitation with 50 μJ cm−2 nanosecond laser pulse, giving the electron lifetime τOC = 3.3 ms at open circuit conditions with the bias light of about 1 Sun. The decay of photovoltage measured without additional irradiation was highly stretched and reached zero after a single second, reflecting the strong dependence of the electron lifetime on the Fermi level.2,9,32 The instrument response time at 1 MΩ impedance input was found not to perturb the measured lifetime, because the response time at this impedance was about 0.5 ms (measured with a fast photodiode). Moreover, the electron lifetime was found to be the same for a smaller (5 kΩ) impedance input. Similar electron lifetime values at the corresponding Fermi level were recently reported for a DSSC based on D149, ZnO nanoparticles and iodide liquid electrolyte when measured with different techniques.9 At short circuit conditions, the photocurrent decay time constant was τSC = 1.2 ms, independent of the presence or absence of bias light. The excitation with higher pulse intensities resulted in similar time constants, but the fit of one exponential decay to the kinetics was worse. We have also observed similar time constants in equilibrated irradiation when a xenon lamp was used instead of nanosecond laser pulses. In these cases the photocurrent transients at short circuit were measured with xenon lamp light modulated by a chopper and the instrument function was taken into account in the fit (Fig. S4, ESI†), while the electron lifetime at open circuit conditions was determined from the time derivative of the open circuit voltage decay (Fig. S5, ESI†).9,32
 Fig. 5  Transient photovoltage (VOC, scale on the right, measured at open circuit with 1 Sun bias) and transient photocurrent (ISC, scale on the left, measured at short circuit) of D149/EL under pump pulse of energy density 50 μJ cm−2. The solid black lines shows the one exponential fits with the time constants given in the inset. 
The photovoltage and photocurrent time constants measured above for D149/EL enable the estimation of charge collection efficiency:29 (6)where the charge collection rate (kcc) and titania–electrolyte electron recombination (klifetime) rates are related to the measured time constants by: τOC = (klifetime)−1 and τSC = (klifetime + kcc)−1. From these relations: klifetime = 3 × 102 s−1, kcc = 5.3 × 102 s−1, and ηcc = 64%. Therefore, the relatively low charge collection efficiency might be a limiting step for the total charge separation efficiency of the D129/EL solar cell. However, the precise charge collection efficiency can be obtained using eqn (6) if both kcc and klifetime are measured at the same Fermi level. The klifetime value will be smaller at short circuit conditions than that measured at open circuit conditions. Moreover, the charge collection rate was reported to increase when the photocurrent is measured in the working conditions, near the open circuit voltage of the solar cell.33 Thus, the real charge collection efficiency might be higher than 64% at both open and short circuit conditions.
The natural expectation would be that the Stark effect decays on the same time scale as the electrons responsible for the electric field experienced by the sensitizers. However, both klifetime and kcc rates determining the decay of the electron population in the nanoparticle network are about one order of magnitude smaller than the average decay of the Stark effect (kStark = 5 × 103 s−1). This important observation means that either the electrons are somehow “neutralized” before they disappear in recombination or charge collection processes, or that the electrons become efficiently trapped in the sites located further from the dyes. The first possibility has already been employed in the concept of electron screening by small lithium cations present in the electrolyte.14,15 It was proposed, based on the results obtained for ruthenium sensitizers, that after dye regeneration, the electrons present in nanoparticles attract Li+ atoms that compensate the negative charge at the surface and cancel the local electric field “seen” by the attached dye molecules.14 The half-life of this diffusion process, measured at the bleach region, was found to be about 10 μs, much faster than the half-life of electron recombination to I3− (about 1 ms).14 Interestingly, in the studies of Ru-complex systems without lithium cations in the electrolyte, the delayed bleach seems to decay over a time scale similar to electron lifetimes, but the exact rates are not given.16 However, for solid state DSSCs with D149, a contrary effect was observed in photoinduced absorption experiments: upon the addition of Li+ the bleach decay became longer from 0.15 to 0.3 ms.8
Therefore, we would like to propose a second possible explanation for the faster disappearance of the Stark shift than the decay of electron concentration. It is based on the role of trap states at grain boundaries between TiO2 nanoparticles that are found in some studies to be the limiting factor in electron transport in DSSCs.34,35 After pulse excitation, the electrons injected into nanoparticles occupy first surface trap states at the titania–electrolyte interface, close to the attached dye molecules, so they induce the absorption shift due to the Stark effect. Later, after dye regeneration, the electrons diffuse between nanoparticles and are caught at grain boundary trap sites for statistically longer times than at interface surface trap sites. In the vicinity of the grain boundaries, the dye molecules are not attached, so the electric field from electrons trapped there cannot induce an absorption shift on the dyes. The role of trap states at grain boundaries might also be consistent with the earlier-mentioned strange difference in intensity dependence of recombination rates between the pulse and continuous irradiation. In the latter equilibrated conditions, the electrons might be statistically more often trapped at grain boundaries than at interfacial surfaces, and the recombination probability is smaller at the former than at the latter. Therefore, increasing the continuous bias illumination does not accelerate the recombination rate as much as when increasing the exciting pulse energy, as we observed for D149/ACN.
Finally, it can be noted that we did not observe significant changes of our samples during the experiments. The intensity of the stationary absorption band decreased upon extensive laser irradiation, but its shape remained the same (Fig. S6A, ESI†). Moreover, the shape of the kinetic curves was the same for the fresh and irradiated samples (Fig. S6B, ESI†).
4 Conclusions
Charge separation processes in a complete DSSC made of D149 dye, TiO2 nanoparticle network and liquid, iodide-based electrolyte were studied over the time scale from nanoseconds to seconds. Using a classical flash photolysis setup with only a few simple modifications, we obtained the rates of the following processes, measured for the same sample under the same conditions: dye regeneration (2 × 106 s−1), titania–dye electron recombination (from 2 × 104 to 16 × 104 s−1, depending on the excitation energy density), Stark shift decay (5 × 103 s−1), charge collection (5.2 × 102 s−1) and titania–electrolyte electron recombination (3 × 102 s−1 at 1 Sun irradiation). The presence of the Stark effect was found to affect both the negative bleaching kinetics and the positive radical cation signals. A scheme of the measured rate constants accompanying the charge separation is shown in the ESI† (Scheme S1). The spectral analysis showed that the local electric field responsible for the Stark effect is connected with electrons in titania rather than with the oxidized dyes. The role of trap sites in the grain boundaries is proposed to explain the observed difference between the decay time constants for the Stark shift and electron concentration. We believe that our results are representative of a large class of metal-free sensitizers used in DSSCs and will aid a better understanding of laser spectroscopy for solar cell optimization.
