    , Accepted 26th January 2012First published on 26th January 2012AbstractWater oxidation is a key half reaction in energy conversion schemes based on solar fuels and targets such as light driven water splitting or carbon dioxide reduction into CO, other oxygenates, or hydrocarbons. Carrying out these reactions at rates that exceed the rate of solar insolation for the extended periods of time required for useful applications presents a major challenge. Water oxidation is the key “other” half reaction in these schemes and it is dominated by PCET given its multi-electron, multi-proton character, 2H2O → O2 + 4e− + 4H+. Identification of PCET was an offshoot of experiments designed to investigate energy conversion by electron transfer quenching of molecular excited states. The concepts “redox potential leveling” and concerted electron–proton transfer came from measurements on stepwise oxidation of cis-RuII(bpy)2(py)(OH2)2+ to RuIV(bpy)2(py)(O)2+. The Ru “blue dimer”, cis,cis-(bpy)2(H2O)RuORu(OH2)(bpy)24+, was the first designed catalyst for water oxidation. It undergoes oxidative activation by PCET to give the transient (bpy)2(O)RuVORuV(O)(bpy)24+, O-atom attack on water to give a peroxidic intermediate, and further oxidation and O2 release. More recently, a class of single site water oxidation catalysts has been identified, e.g., Ru(tpy)(bpm)(OH2)2+ (tpy is 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine; bpm is 2,2′-bipyrimidine). They undergo stepwise PCET oxidation to RuIV=O2+ or RuV(O)3+ followed by O-atom transfer with formation of peroxidic intermediates which undergo further oxidation and O2 release. PCET plays a key role in the three zones of water oxidation reactivity: oxidative activation, O⋯O bond formation, oxidation and O2 release from peroxidic intermediates. Similar schemes have been identified for electrocatalytic water oxidation on oxide electrode surfaces based on phosphonated derivatives such as [Ru(Mebimpy)(4,4′-(PO3H2CH2)2bpy)(OH2)]2+. A PCET barrier to RuIII–OH2+ → RuIV=O2+ oxidation arises from the large difference in pKa values between RuIII–OH2+ and RuIV(OH)3+. On oxide surfaces this oxidation occurs by multiple pathways. Kinetic, mechanistic, and DFT results on single site catalysts reveal a new pathway for the O⋯O bond forming step (Atom-Proton Transfer, APT), significant rate enhancements by added proton acceptor bases, and accelerated water oxidation in propylene carbonate as solvent with water added as a stoichiometric reagent. Lessons learned about water oxidation and the role of PCET and concerted pathways appear to have direct relevance for water oxidation in Photosystem II (PSII) with PSII a spectacular example of PCET in action. This includes a key role for Multiple Site-Electron Proton Transfer in oxidative activation of the Oxygen Evolving Complex (OEC) in the S0 → S1 transition in the Kok cycle.Christopher J.

Broader context
Water oxidation is a key half reaction in energy conversion schemes based on solar fuels with light-driven water splitting or carbon dioxide reduction into CO, other oxygenates, or hydrocarbons notable targets. Water oxidation is the key “other” half reaction in these schemes. With its multi-electron, multi-proton character, 2H2O → O2 + 4e− + 4H+, it is dominated by proton coupled electron transfer (PCET). Single site Ru complex catalysts have been identified which undergo stepwise PCET oxidation from RuII–OH22+ to RuIV=O2+ or RuV(O)3+. The higher oxidation state oxo complexes undergo O-atom transfer with water giving peroxidic intermediates which undergo further oxidation and O2 release. PCET plays an important role in the three zones of water oxidation reactivity: oxidative activation, O⋯O bond formation, and oxidation and O2 release. It has been shown that water oxidation reactivity is retained on oxide surfaces and that significant rate accelerations occur with added proton acceptor bases by “Atom Proton Transfer” pathways and in propylene carbonate with water added as a stoichiometric reagent. Lessons learned about water oxidation and the role of PCET have direct relevance for water oxidation in Photosystem II (PSII), with PSII a spectacular example of PCET in action.

1. Introduction
Although appealing as an ultimate energy source, solar energy is limited by its diffuse and intermittent character. Large collection areas and relatively high efficiencies are required for realistic applications. Even more challenging is the associated need for energy storage at massive levels for night time power generation.1,2 The only feasible solution to the energy storage challenge, at the required scale, is solar fuels and harnessing solar energy to drive energy storage reactions such as water splitting, eqn (1), or solar driven water reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons, eqn (2), CO, or other oxygenates. 2H2O + 4hυ → 2H2 + O2 (ΔG° = 4.92 eV, n = 4)(1) 2H2O + CO2 + 8hυ → CH4 + 2O2 (ΔG° = 10.3 eV, n = 8)(2)
Integrating the required functions – light absorption/excited state electron transfer or bandgap excitation; separation of oxidative and reductive equivalents by free energy gradients or internal electric fields; electron transfer activation of catalysis at physically separated half reactions – poses a considerable challenge. Systematic approaches are available including a “modular” approach in which separate functional elements are developed independently, maximized for performance, and integrated in multifunctional arrays at the molecular level or nanoscale.3–12
Two applications of the modular approach are illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. One is a complex, multi-functional molecular assembly for water splitting. The other is a Dye Sensitized Photoelectrosynthesis Cell (DSPEC) for solar driven reduction of CO2. The latter is based on the Dye Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) design, but the goal is solar energy conversion to give high energy fuels rather than a photo-potential and photocurrent.3,4,13–20

The genesis of the modular approach came in the early 1970's in an experiment designed to demonstrate, for the first time, that molecular excited states could undergo electron transfer. It was based on the, now famous, Metal-to-Ligand Charge Transfer (MLCT) excited state of Ru(bpy)32+, Ru(bpy)32+*. The ground state of this complex is an intense visible light absorber with λmax at ∼450 nm depending somewhat on the medium. Visible excitation over a wide wavelength range results in rapid relaxation and decay to the lowest energy MLCT excited state, Ru(bpy)32+*. The electronic configuration of this state is 3[(dπ)5(πbpy*)1] with the excited electron in a π* level on a bpy ligand. Ru(bpy)32+* is largely triplet in character and decays on the μsec time scale in fluid solution.21,22
Based on quenching experiments with Co(III) ammine complexes, Adamson and coworkers suggested that electron transfer quenching could occur. However, their results were equivocal and could also be explained by energy transfer.23–25 The first direct experimental demonstration came in experiments with added methyl viologen, MV2+. In solutions containing Ru(bpy)32+ and MV2+, at concentrations sufficient to quench the excited state, flash photolysis experiments demonstrated the appearance of MV+· radical cation at λmax ∼ 610 nm following the flash and the quenching scheme in eqn (3).26–29 Ru(bpy)32+ (dπ6) + hν → RuIII(bpy−·)(bpy)22+* (dπ5)(π*)1(3)Ru(bpy)32+* + MV2+ → Ru(bpy)33+ + MV+·  
This was an important result. It showed that excited state electron transfer quenching could occur, but, after inspecting the redox potentials for the couples involved, Table 1, something far more interesting emerged. Oxidative quenching had converted the initial, transiently stored excited state energy into redox products, Ru(bpy)33+ and MV+·, which were thermodynamically capable of oxidizing and reducing water, respectively.29 This result, following on the observation by Honda and Fujishima that ultraviolet bandgap excitation of TiO2 led to water splitting,30 helped to create “Artificial Photosynthesis” and “Chemical Approaches to Artificial Photosynthesis” with the latter based on application of molecular events in molecular and nanoscale assemblies.3,12,18

Demonstrating electron transfer quenching and energy conversion was important but only a beginning. Following the excitation-quenching sequence, back electron transfer, Ru(bpy)33+ + MV+· → Ru(bpy)32+ + MV2+, occurred on the 1–10 μsec time scale releasing the transiently stored redox energy as heat. Energy conversion and solar fuels would require more, namely, multifunctional integrated assemblies that combine key elements for driving the physically separated half reactions leading to the designs in Fig. 1.
A series of integrated events is utilized in the molecular assembly in Fig. 1 for water splitting _ i) light absorption at an antenna, ii) energy transfer sensitization of a molecular excited state, iii) electron transfer quenching, iv) electron transfer separation of oxidative and reductive equivalents driven by free energy gradients, v) electron transfer activation of catalysts for water oxidation and reduction, vi) catalysis of the physically separated half reactions, and vii) proton equilibration _ all incorporated in a single assembly.3,12,18 In the photoelectrochemical DSPEC design for CO2 reduction, molecular level excitation and excited state injection occur at the interface of a high band gap semiconductor, typically TiO2, with injected electrons used to drive a catalyst for CO2 reduction (Catred). Oxidative equivalents are built up at a second catalyst for water oxidation (Catox) with proton equilibration by a proton exchange membrane (PEM) separating the half reactions. This design is appealing for its simplicity in applying the modular design approach.
Many designs are possible for solar fuel devices. At the inescapable heart of any is the need to carry out water oxidation at rapid rates with unlimited longevity in a fully functioning device.
2. The search for water oxidation catalysts. PCET appears
With the result on Ru(bpy)32+* in hand, the solar fuels challenge broadened to include catalysts for water oxidation and reduction of CO2. There was little to go on for water oxidation. Bruce Moyer, a graduate student in the Meyer group at the time, suggested that it would make sense to have a water molecule in the coordination sphere of a putative catalyst and prepared the aqua complex derivative of Ru(bpy)32+, cis-Ru(bpy)2(py)OH22+.
What he found, based on chemical oxidation and electrochemical studies, established a basis for PCET.31–33 Oxidation to Ru(III) was pH dependent with a decrease in pKa from 10.6 for RuII–OH22+ to 0.85 in RuIII–OH23+, a decrease comparable to the decrease in pKa from FeII(OH2)62+ (pKa,1 = 9.5) to FeIII(OH2)63+ (pKa,1 = 2.2).34,35 Further oxidation resulted in a surprise when he found that both an electron and proton were lost from RuIII–OH2+ to give the oxo complex, RuIV(bpy)2(py)(O)2+.35 There was precedence in the literature for Ru(IV) but very limited evidence for well-defined oxo complexes.
This initial discovery led to important results quickly. The significant decrease in pKa upon oxidation led to pH dependent redox couples. The formal potential for the Ru(III/II) couple for cis-Ru(bpy)2(py)OH22+ (E°′) was found to vary predictably with pH as shown in eqn (4) which follows directly from the Nernst equation. The impact on E°′ values of proton loss was of great importance for multi-electron redox couples and for multi-electron catalysis. As shown by E1/2 ∼ E°′ values in Scheme 1, with E°′ the formal potential, at pH = 7, sequential PCET oxidation from RuII–OH22+ to RuIII–OH2+ to RuIV=O2+ occurs with Δ E°′ = 0.11 V compared to 0.5–1.5 V typically found for sequential 1e− couples. E(RuIII/II) = E°′(Ru–OH3+/2+2) − 0.059{log(KIIIa,1 + [H+]) − log(KIIa,1 + [H+])}(4)
 Scheme 1  Redox potential levelling by PCET in the oxidation of RuII(H2O)2+ to RuIV=O. 
The decrease in ΔE°′ was largely due to PCET. Loss of both protons and electrons in these PCET half reactions avoided charge build up.35–37 This aspect of PCET is crucial in multi-electron, multi-proton catalysis because it provides a basis for accumulating multiple redox equivalents at single sites or clusters at closely spaced potentials. At the same time, PCET provides a basis for activation toward water oxidation. Loss of 2e−/2H+ in the oxidation of RuII–OH22+ to RuIV=O2+ was already half way to the 4e−/4H+ requirement for water oxidation. It also created a reactive RuIV=O2+ site and a mechanistic basis for O–O bond formation based on O-atom transfer from RuIV=O2+, a well established pathway for RuIV=O2+ complexes.36
The mechanistic impact of PCET was also revealed in a kinetic study on the comproportionation reaction between RuII–OH22+ and RuIV=O2+ to give 2RuIII–OH2+, Scheme 2.31–33 The study was conducted to establish how the proton was transferred between sites. Insight came from a H2O/D2O kinetic isotope effect (KIE) study which revealed an isotope effect of 16.1 and a mole fraction study which showed involvement by a single proton.31 These results led to the suggestion that the comproportionation reaction occurred by a concerted process in which both an electron and proton were transferred from the RuII–OH22+ donor to the RuIV=O2+ acceptor.
 Scheme 2  Comproportionation reaction between RuIV=O2+ and RuII–OH22+ illustrating concerted electron-proton transfer (EPT).31,38 
In the initial nomenclature, the concerted pathway was described as “Proton Coupled Electron Transfer” or PCET to distinguish it from H-atom transfer. The term PCET has come to be used more generally to describe reactions in which both electrons and protons are transferred regardless of mechanism. In the reaction in Scheme 2, electron transfer occurs between orbitals largely dπRu(II) and dπRu(IV) in character and proton transfer from σ(O–H) to a lone pair on the oxo group of RuIV=O2+. These orbital characteristics distinguish this elementary reaction from H-atom transfer in which electrons and protons are transferred to or from the same bond. The term “Electron-Proton Transfer” or EPT has been proposed for this reaction and is consistent with ET for electron transfer and PT for proton transfer.35,39
The initial attempt to achieve water oxidation with cis-Ru(bpy)2(py)OH22+ failed. Oxidative activation to RuIV=O2+ was a step in the right direction but the thermodynamics of water oxidation were unfavorable by 0.1 V. Success was found with the structurally related “blue dimer”, cis,cis-(bpy)2(H2O)RuORu(OH2)(bpy)24+.40–43 Related μ-oxo bridged complexes had been reported earlier by Dwyer and coworkers44 and the aqua dimer was synthesized at UNC. The structure was appealing in having two Ru–OH22+ sites available to match the overall 4e−/4H+ requirement for water oxidation. Because of strong electronic coupling and Ru–O orbital mixing across the μ-oxo bridge, the required 2e− change at each site was based on a Ru(III) → Ru(V) oxidation state change rather than Ru(II) → Ru(IV). The net effect was the same, 4e−/4H+ oxidation of (H2O)RuIIIORuIII(OH2)4+ gave (O)RuVORuV(O)4+ which reacted rapidly and irreversibly with water, ultimately giving O2 as the product.45–48
As shown by the E1/2vs. pH plot in Fig. 2, the pH dependent PCET behavior for the blue dimer is complex induced by changes in pKa with electron content. Given the requirement for 4e−/4H+ loss, such complexity must exist for any water oxidation catalyst on a surface or in solution.

The results of an extended kinetics/mechanism investigation revealed the intricate, stepwise mechanism for water oxidation shown in Scheme 3. Key features in the scheme include: 1) stepwise oxidation from (H2O)RuIIIORuIII(OH2)4+ to (O)RuVORuV(O)4+ with RuIVORuIV unstable with regard to disproportionation, 2) structural characterization of both (H2O)RuIIIORuIII(OH2)4+ and (HO)RuIVORuIII(OH2)4+ and observation of (O)RuIVORuV(O)3+ as an intermediate, 3) further oxidation to (O)RuVORuV(O)4+ which is a transient undergoing rapid water oxidation by O⋯O bond formation to give the peroxidic intermediate, (HOO)RuIVORuIV(O)4+. 4) Further oxidation of the intermediate with proton loss and oxygen release.35,36,48
 Scheme 3  Mechanism of water oxidation by the blue dimer.48 
As shown in Scheme 3, water oxidation catalysis by the blue dimer is complicated by anion binding (anation) which inhibits catalysis. Anation is triggered by O2 release and is catalytically debilitating because it blocks further catalytic cycles that rely on coordination of two water molecules. Re-entry into the catalytic cycle cannot occur until water displaces the coordinated anion.46–48
The kinetic impact of PCET on water oxidation by the blue dimer also became apparent in electrochemical studies. As shown by the cyclic voltammogram (CV) in Fig. 3, oxidation of the blue dimer at an ITO (Sn(IV) doped In2O3) electrode provided evidence for a single 1e−/1H+ oxidation wave for the (HO)RuIVORuIII(OH2)4+/(H2O)RuIIIORuIII(OH2)4+ couple at E1/2 = 1.04 V vs. NHE in 0.1 M triflic acid with no sign of further oxidation. As shown by scan rate dependent measurements and the large peak-to-peak splitting between oxidative (Ep,a) and reductive peak potentials (Ep,c) in Fig. 3, even the 1e− wave is kinetically slow under these conditions.

From the E1/2-pH diagram in Fig. 2, a further 3e−/3H+ wave is predicted to appear at Ep,a = 1.57 V vs. NHE for further oxidation of (HO)RuIVORuIII(OH2)4+ to (O)RuVORuV(O)4+. Both of the intermediate oxidation states RuIVORuIV and (HO)RuIVORuV(O)4+ are unstable with respect to disproportionation under these conditions. The predicted 3e−/3H+ wave does not appear because there is a kinetic inhibition to oxidation of (HO)RuIVORuIII(OH2)4+ to the unstable intermediate RuIVORuIV. The latter, presumably as (HO)RuIVORuIV(OH)4+, is unstable with respect to disproportionation due to a high potential for the RuIVORuIV/RuIVORuIII couple. RuIVORuIV is the most strongly oxidizing intermediate in the series of blue dimer intermediates involved in water oxidation.51
The dramatic electrode response to further oxidation of the blue dimer on an ITO electrode surface-derivatized by binding Ru(bpy)2(4,4′(PO3H2)2bpy)2+ (ITO-Ru2+) is also shown in Fig. 3.45,46 The Ru(III/II) couple for the surface wave (ITO-Ru3+/2+) appears in Fig. 3A at E1/2 = 1.31 V vs. NHE. As shown in Fig. 3B, the surface couple “turns on” 3e−/3H+ oxidation of (HO)RuIVORuIII(OH2)4+ to (O)RuVORuV(O)4+. The origin of the catalytic effect has been proposed to lie in an enhanced rate of surface oxidation of (HO)RuIVORuIII(OH2)4+ to (HO)RuIVORuIV(OH)4+. Once the latter is formed it undergoes rapid 2e−/2H+ oxidation to (O)RuVORuV(O)4+ followed by reaction with water to give the peroxidic intermediate, (HOO)RuIIIORuIV(O)4+, Scheme 3. The peroxidic intermediate undergoes further oxidation at Ep,a ∼ 1.57 V with O2 release, and re-enters the catalytic cycle as (HO)RuIVORuIII(OH2)4+.
3. Single site water oxidation catalysis
With mechanistic insight in hand, including knowledge of the key O–O bond forming step, we recently returned to water oxidation based on “single site” catalysts and initiated a kinetic and mechanistic investigation of water oxidation catalysis by the complexes Ru(tpy)(bpz)OH22+ and Ru(tpy)(bpm)OH22+ (tpy is 2,2′,2′′-terpyridine; bpz is 2,2′-bipyrazine; bpm is 2,2′-bipyrimidine, Fig. 4).52–54 Relative to bpy, both bpz and bpm have low lying π* acceptor levels which back-bond and stabilize dπ6 Ru(II). This increases Ru(III/II) reduction potentials relative to cis-Ru(bpy)2(py)OH22+ and, with it, the oxidizing strength of the associated RuIV=O2+/RuII–OH22+ couples.55,56
 Fig. 4  A) 2,2′-bipyrizine. B) 2,2′-pipyrimidine. 
As shown by the E1/2-pH diagram in Fig. 5, which compares Ru(tpy)(bpy)OH22+ and Ru(tpy)(bpm)OH22+, exchange of bpy by bpm does increase E1/2 for the Ru(III/II) couple. The increase is sufficient to increase E°′ for the RuIV=O2+/RuII–OH22+ couple above the potential for water oxidation shown as the blue dashed line in Fig. 5. The increase is also sufficient that E°′(RuIII–OH2+/RuII–OH22+) > E°′(RuIV=O2+/RuIII–OH23+) making Ru(III) unstable with respect to disproportionation. Only a single 2e−/2H+ RuIV=O2+/RuII–OH22+ wave is observed over a wide pH range.52,53

Although the RuIV=O forms of these complexes do oxidize water, the rate of water oxidation is slow.52,57 CVs of the new complexes revealed something far more interesting. Extending the scans to more positive potentials resulted in electrocatalytic water oxidation and evidence for a new, pH independent wave for a RuV=(O)3+/RuIV=O2+ couple and RuV(O)3+ was clearly reactive toward water oxidation.
A detailed kinetic/mechanistic investigation of water oxidation by these complexes with Ce(IV) as oxidant revealed the catalytic water oxidation cycle shown in Fig. 6. This cycle is related to the oxidative activation/O-atom transfer/peroxide sequence for the blue dimer in Scheme 3 but, importantly, it shows that a single site is sufficient for water oxidation catalysis. In this mechanism there are several key elements:

1) Oxidative activation by PCET provides access to the high oxidation state oxo intermediates RuIV=O2+ and RuV(O)3+ with electronic configurations dπ4 and dπ3. Stepwise PCET “primes” the catalyst by removing protons and electrons creating an electron deficient site capable of O-atom transfer and O⋯O bond formation.
2) In the O⋯O bond forming step, RuV(O)3+ acts as a 2e− acceptor: RuV(O)3+ + H2O → RuIII–OOH2+ + H+.58
3) The dπ5 peroxidic intermediate, RuIII–OOH2+, is stabilized by coordination of the hydroperoxide anion, OOH−, see below.
4) The initial peroxidic intermediate undergoes further oxidation to dπ4 RuIV(OO)2+. DFT calculations and literature precedence point to RuIV(OO)2+ as a 7-coordinate, (O22−) chelate with thermal access to a higher energy “open” form.52
5) RuIV(OO)2+ slowly loses O2 adding H2O and re-entering the water oxidation cycle as RuII–OH22+.
6) When further oxidized to dπ3 RuV(OO)3+, the peroxidic intermediate rapidly loses O2 and re-enters the catalytic cycle as RuIII–OH2+.
7) From electrochemical measurements, the E°′ value for RuIV=O2+ oxidation to RuV(O)3+ is higher than E°′ for oxidation of either of the peroxidic intermediates.
Each of the intermediates from RuIV=O2+ to RuIV(OO)2+ has been observed spectroscopically and calculated results from DFT have provided molecular and electronic structural information.53 Depending on catalyst and conditions, the overall catalytic cycle can be rate limited by RuIII–OH2+ → RuIV=O2+ or RuIV=O2+ → RuV(O)3+ oxidation, O⋯O bond formation, O2 release from RuIV(OO)2+, or oxidation of RuIV(OO)2+ to RuV(OO)3+.
Water oxidation catalysis by single site Ru catalysts has advanced rapidly since the initial observations were made.52,59,60 Variations in the surrounding ligands have been used to modify both redox potentials and reactivity with the ultimate goal of maximizing rates and catalytic turnovers.52–56,61–65 Conditions have been found for enhancing reactivity by introducing new reaction pathways.66 It has been even been shown that water oxidation can occur without water as the solvent by using propylene carbonate, with water added as a stoichiometric reagent.66
Reactivity toward water oxidation is retained on oxide surfaces_ ITO, FTO (fluorine doped SnO2), and a variety of oxide semiconductors including TiO2 by surface binding of phosphonate-derivatized complexes in interfacial configurations appropriate for electrochemical and photoelectroelectrochemical applications.54,56,58,66 As shown in Fig. 7 and 8, this includes the phosphonate derivatized catalyst [Ru(Mebimpy)(4,4′-(PO3H2CH2)2bpy)(OH2)]2+ (1-PO3H2) (Mebimpy is 2,6-bis(1-methylbenzimidazol-2-yl)pyridine; 4,4′-(PO3H2CH2)2bpy is 4,4′-bis-methlylenephosphonato-2,2′-bipyridine). Fig. 7 illustrates sustained water oxidation electrocatalysis on a planar FTO electrode with the electrode potential held past E°′ for the RuV=(O)3+/RuIV=O2+ couple.

Stable surface binding also occurs on nanoITO which is both optically transparent and conducting. nanoITO is prepared in thicknesses ranging from the sub-micron to ∼10 microns by using standard sol–gel methods. A scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of a mesoporous, nanostructured, ∼3 μM thick film of nanoITO is shown in Fig. 7.67 For surface-attached catalysts, nanoITO enables simultaneous spectral and electrochemical monitoring and unprecedented insight into both mechanism and catalysis without complications from translational diffusion of the catalyst.
4. PCET in catalyst activation
As shown by the mechanisms in Fig. 6, and on an oxide surface in Fig. 8, water oxidation is a complex process involving multiple steps and multiple intermediates. As noted above, in this case, or any other involving water oxidation in solution or on a surface, complexity is an unavoidable consequence of the 4e−/4H+ nature of the reaction. As illustrated in Fig. 8, there are three zones of reactivity for water oxidation: oxidative activation which poises the catalyst electronically and energetically to interact with water; O⋯O bond formation; oxidation of an intermediate peroxide or peroxides with O2 release.
In the single site catalytic mechanisms in Fig. 6 and 8, initial oxidation occurs from RuII–OH22+ to RuIII–OH2+. Oxidation to RuIII–OH2+ is followed by the stepwise reactions in the catalytic cycle: RuIII–OH2+ RuIV=O2+RuV=O3+RuIII(OOH)2+RuIV(OO)2+RuV(OO)3+ RuIII–OH2+. By appropriate control of the ligand environment, E°′ values for Ru(IV/II) couples can be increased sufficiently to enable relatively rapid water oxidation through cycles involving RuIV=O2+ rather than RuV=(O)3+. These cycles remain to be investigated in detail but appear to involve RuIV(OO)2+ as a key intermediate.
In principle, any of the steps in the overall water oxidation cycle can be rate limiting depending on the complex and reaction conditions. Kinetic complications due to a PCET kinetic inhibition are commonly observed in oxidative activation at the RuIII–OH2+ → RuIV=O2+ stage. They arise from the significant difference in pKa properties between Ru(IV) and Ru(III). As shown in the E°′-pKa diagram for cis-Ru(bpy)2(py)(OH2)2+ at pH = 7, in Scheme 4, there is a pKa difference of more than 14 pKa units between RuIII–OH2+ and RuIV(OH)3+. The thermodynamic potential for oxidation of RuIII–OH2+ to RuIV=O2+ is only 0.78 V vs. NHE. However, at an inert electrode there is no low energy, direct pathway for simultaneous e−/H+ loss. Stepwise mechanisms are available: 1) ET-PT in which oxidation of RuIII–OH2+ to RuIV(OH)3+ is followed by proton transfer to give RuIV=O2+. 2) PT-ET in which proton loss from RuIII–OH2+ is followed by oxidation of RuIII–O+. Both involve high energy intermediates with ΔG°′ > 0.4 eV for the first step in the ET-PT mechanism and ΔG°′ = 0.059(pKa-pH) at 25 °C for the PT step in PT-ET.
 Scheme 4  Potential (E1/2) -pKa diagram for cis-Ru(bpy)2(py)(OH2)2+ at pH = 7, T = 22 ± 2 °C, I = 0.1. 
A PCET barrier also exists for RuII–OH22+ oxidation to RuIII–OH2+ but ΔpKa is only 9 units. An electrochemical study on the related Os complex, cis-Os(bpy)2(py)(OH2)2+, by Savéant and coworkers, has revealed pH-potential domains where interconversion between OsII–OH22+ and OsIII–OH2+ is dominated by PT-ET or ET-PT.68,69
In the absence of a concerted pathway for EPT, either stepwise ET-PT or PT-ET introduces an additional increment to the barrier for electron transfer at the thermodynamic potential for the couple. Either proceeds through a high energy intermediate RuIV(OH)3+ or RuIII–O1+ and a positive ΔG for the initial step. This increase in barrier leads to slow interfacial electron transfer and, often, badly distorted voltammetric waveforms.
An example is shown in Fig. 9 for electrochemical oxidation of surface bound nanoITO-RuIIOH22+ ([Ru(Mebimpy)(4,4′-(PO3H2CH2)2bpy)(OH2)]2+). In an oxidative scan at pH = 5 in 0.1 M HOAc/OAc− at 10 mV s−1, a kinetically reversible wave appears for the RuIII–OH2+/RuII–OH23+ couple at E1/2 = 0.68 V. It is followed by a wave at Ep,a = 1.0 V for the RuIV=O2+/RuIII–OH2+ couple, but of greatly diminished peak current. Continuing the oxidative scan reveals a second Ru(III → IV) oxidation at Ep,a = 1.23 V. Reversal of the potential scan past the second wave reveals a scan rate and pH dependent re-reduction wave. It arises from reduction of RuIV=O2+ to RuIII–O+ followed by rapid proton transfer to give RuIII–OH2+.70

A detailed electrochemical investigation on nanoITO-RuII–OH22+ has revealed that RuIII–OH2+ → RuIV=O2+ oxidation on the surface overcomes the PCET limitation by utilizing multiple pathways. Their relative importance depends on scan rate, extent of surface loading, and solution composition (Fig. 9 and 10). In one pathway, cross-surface disproportionation, 2RuIIIOH2+ → RuIV=O2+ + RuII–OH22+, leads to RuIV=O2+, Fig. 10. This indirect pathway was identified earlier for surface bound Ru(tpy)(4,4′-(PO3H2)2bpy)(OH2)2+ on ITO.57

A second pathway is induced by added OAc− _ Multiple Site-Electron Proton Transfer (MS-EPT). In this pathway electron transfer to the electrode occurs in concert with H+ transfer to OAc− in a H-bonded ion pair between Ru–OH2+ and OAc−, RuIII–OH2+--OAc− RuIV=O2+–H-OAc. A related pathway has been identified by Savéant and co-workers in the diffusional oxidation of cis-OsIII(bpy)2(py)(OH)2+ to OsIV(bpy)2(py)(O)2+.68,69
In a third pathway, direct 1e− oxidation of RuIII–OH2+ to RuIV(OH)3+ occurs, RuIII–OH2+ RuIV(OH)3+, followed by proton loss to give RuIV=O2+.58,70 From pH-dependent potential measurements, pKa ∼ 3 for RuIV(OH)2+ with E1/2 = 1.25 V for the Ru(OH)3+/2+ couple vs. NHE, I = 0.1. It is not clear that RuIV(OH)2+ is a simple proton adduct. It may be a coordination-expanded intermediate.
In a fourth pathway, in propylene carbonate as solvent, there is evidence for participation by a phosphonate group or groups as proton acceptors in the oxidation of RuIII–OH2+ to RuIV=O2+, eqn (5). (5)
Oxidative scans to the RuIV=O2+ → RuV(O)3+ wave at Ep,a = ∼1.65 V initiate water oxidation. As shown in Fig. 8 for [Ru(Mebimpy)(4,4′-(PO3H2CH2)2bpy)(OH2)]2+ on nanoITO, RuV(O)3+ undergoes O-atom transfer to water by APT to give the peroxidic intermediate, RuIII–OOH2+. There is direct evidence for peroxidic intermediates on ITO or nanoITO electrodes. pH-dependent waves for the RuIV(OO)2+/RuIII–OOH2+–RuIII–OOH2+/RuII(HOOH)2+ couples appear at E1/2 = 0.31 and 0.22 V at pH 5, Fig. 11.67 RuIV(OO)2+ forms spontaneously from nanoITO-RuII–OH22+ on air-dried electrodes by O2 displacement of water, nanoITO-RuII–OH22+ + O2 → nanoITO-RuIV(OO)2+ + H2O. nanoITO-RuIV(OO)2+ undergoes further oxidation, RuIV(OO)2+ RuV(OO)3+, at Ep,a = 1.35 V.
In a DFT study, two possible forms of RuIV(OO)2+ and RuV(OO)3+ were predicted, one a 7-coordinate O22− chelate. Related structures are known and this is, presumably, the structure of nanoITO-RuIV(OO)2+. The other is a 6 coordinate form with O22− terminally bound.8 Slow interconversion between forms was predicted with the chelate favored in Ru(IV) and the “open” form in Ru(V).
5. PCET in O–O bond formation
As noted above, the key to water oxidation catalysis is PCET oxidative activation of an aqua precursor with e−/H+ loss giving an electron deficient intermediate thermodynamically capable of O–O bond formation. In the catalytic cycle in Fig. 6 and 8, this occurs at the 3e−/2H+ stage with RuII–OH22+ converted into RuV(O)3+. Oxidation creates a powerful oxidant with E°′ ∼ 1.4 V for the 2e−/2H+ RuV(O)3+/RuIII–OH23+ couple at pH = 3. The essential O–O bond forming step is frequently the rate limiting step or a contributor to rate limiting behavior in water oxidation cycles. It is analogous to O-atom transfer reactions from RuIV=O2+ to more reducing substrates such as phosphines (RuIV=O2+ + PR3 → RuIIOPR3), sulfides, or olefins.36,71–75 In these reactions, net electron transfer occurs to a RuO acceptor orbital that is of strongly mixed dπRu-pπO character and antibonding with regard to the RuO interaction.
The initial RuIII–OOH2+ intermediate is stabilized electronically by the hydroperoxide-RuIII electronic interaction which is important in making the formation of the peroxide favorable in contrast to free hydrogen peroxide. This can be seen from the data in eqn (6). Oxidation by RuV(O)3+ to free HOOH is thermodynamically unfavorable by ∼0.4 eV at pH = 3, and yet ΔG < 0 for the reaction between RuV(O)3+ and water since it proceeds to completion. RuV(O)3+ + 2 H2O → RuIII–OH2+ + H2O2 + H+: ΔG°′ = +0.4 eV(6a) RuV(O)3+ + H2O → RuIII–OOH2+ + H+: ΔG°′ < 0 eV (pH = 3)(6b)
Based on an electrochemical kinetics study on water oxidation by RuV(tpy)(bpm)(O)3+, in 0.1 M HNO3, kO–O = 3.5 × 10−3 s−1 with a kH2O/kD2O_ kinetic isotope effect (KIE) _ of 6.6.53,58 A KIE of this magnitude points to proton involvement in the O-atom transfer step. Molecular Mechanics-Density Function Theory calculations by Xingqian and Yang, with two individual water molecules included quantum mechanically, were used to explore the O⋯O bond forming step in more detail.58 Based on their calculations, and the results in Fig. 12, the lowest energy pathway for O–O bond formation involves two water molecules. One forms the O–O bond, while the other acts in concert as a proton acceptor. The concerted process is favored because it avoids the high energy intermediate RuIII(OOH2)2+. It has been termed “Atom-Proton Transfer” (APT) to emphasize the transfer of a proton in concert with O atom transfer in the key redox step.58 (7)

Additional kinetic studies with added bases have revealed the generality of the APT pathway with regard to added proton acceptor bases and an opportunity for significant catalysis. This is illustrated by the data in Fig. 13. They demonstrate significant current enhancements for catalyzed water oxidation with the added proton acceptors H2PO4−, OAc−, and HPO42− with rate enhancements of up to 103.58

In a related experiment, water oxidation was investigated in propylene carbonate as the solvent with water added as a limiting reagent. Under these conditions the rate law is first order in both complex and [H2O] with a rate enhancement of ∼300 compared to water, Fig. 14. The rate law is consistent with unassisted O-atom transfer to give RuIII(OOH2)3+ as the initial product in this medium. The markedly higher reactivity in propylene carbonate is due to the loss of solvent stabilization of the reacting water molecule in propylene carbonate compared to water.66

6. PCET in Photosystem II
In green plants the photosynthetic apparatus is found in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. It consists of five membrane-bound, molecular assemblies and the Calvin cycle for CO2 reduction which is located in the stroma outside the membrane. Light driven water oxidation occurs at Photosystem II (PSII) and light driven reduction of NAD+ to NADPH at Photosystem I. In the overall photosynthetic process there is a net storage of 4.56 eV of chemical energy along with the production of 7 ATP molecules 31 kj/mol stored/ATP, eqn (8).
Photosystem II provides a spectacular example of PCET in action. In addition to driving the net reaction in eqn (8), ∼12 protons are transferred across the membrane from the stroma to the lumen for each O2 molecule produced with the resulting pH gradient used to drive ATP production. 2NADP+ + 2H2O + 4hν → 2NADPH + O2 + 2H+(8)ΔG°′ = 4.56 eV + ∼7(ADP + Pi → ATP)
Light driven water oxidation at PSII occurs by the four step Kok cycle shown in Fig. 15.76,77 As for any water oxidation cycle, PCET plays an important role as an unavoidable consequence of the 4e−/4H+ nature of the reaction.35,78 Although enormously complex, many of the key structural and functional details of PSII have been elucidated giving unprecedented insights at the molecular level into how individual steps most likely occur.76,77,79–87

Water oxidation is driven by the energy input from four sequentially absorbed solar photons. Each photon generates and stores an oxidative equivalent at the Oxygen Evolving Complex (OEC) where water oxidation occurs. In the net reaction, eqn (9), water reduces plastoquinone (PQ or QB) to plastoquinol (PQH2 or H2QB) giving oxygen. The reductive equivalents in PQH2 are ultimately used to reduce CO2. Each photon absorbed advances the Kok cycle sequentially through a series of states from S0 to S4 with oxygen evolution occurring at S4.79–82 2 H2O + 2 PQ + 4 hν → O2 + 2 PQH2(9)
Proton management in and through the largely hydrophobic environment surrounding PSII in the thylakoid membrane is a major issue.78 Possible roles for PCET have been discussed in a recent article on integrating excited states and PCET6 and in a previous review where it was noted that it is possible “to view the PSII Reaction Center as an intricate structure that is wired for protons”.78 This account will survey only part of the story, the remarkable sequence of events triggered by absorption of the first photon in advancing the S0 → S1 transition. The reader is referred to the earlier accounts for a more detail.78
The S0 → S1 transition; oxidation of YZ
The sequence of events that occurs upon absorption of the first photon in the Kok cycle is shown in Fig. 15. It is based on a structure of PSII by Ferreira et al. at a resolution of 3.5 Å.82 A more recent structure at 1.9 Å has been published by Shen and coworkers with details illustrated below.79
Light absorption occurs at an antenna array, not shown in Fig. 15, followed by rapid, efficient energy transfer to the terminal chromophore, chlorophyll P680. The net reaction and how it occurs are remarkable. Absorption of a single photon drives a net electron transfer over a distance of ∼50 Å from the OEC to PQ (QB) by a series of 5 electron transfer steps. The reaction creates the first of four oxidative equivalents for water oxidation and a first reductive equivalent, as QB·, for transmission to Photosystem I. The first photon also drives a proton from the stroma into the membrane and a second proton from the OEC through the membrane to the lumen. The proton exiting the OEC appears in the lumen on the 10s of μsec timescale by transfer through a ∼30 Å proton exit channel beginning with Aspartate61, see below.35,78
Once formed by sensitized energy transfer, 1P680* is quenched by electron transfer through neighboring pheophytin pheoD1 to the quinone acceptor QA to give the redox-separated pair QA−·–P680+·. Tyrosine Tyrz intervenes between P680 and the OEC. Its oxidation, QA−·–P680+,YZ → QA−· – P680,YZ·, is essential because it increases the separation distance between the oxidative equivalent at P680+· and reductive equivalent at QA−·. This decreases the rate of back electron transfer, QA−·–P680+ → QA–P680, which is essential for high efficiencies. As noted in the reaction scheme in Fig. 16, the rate constant for P680+ oxidation of YZ, eq. a, is relatively slow with k ∼ 107 s−1, at least compared to the ∼psec timescale for the initial electron transfer quenching of 1P680*. Even though slow, oxidation of YZ is considerably more rapid than back electron transfer and the first photo-produced oxidative equivalent is delivered to the OEC with high efficiency.
 Fig. 16  Proposed role of MS-EPT in the oxidation of YZ by P680+·. Reproduced in part with permission from ref. 82, © 2004 American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
The presence of Histidine 190 (His190) is critical for YZ oxidation to occur and, even more profoundly, for photosynthesis to function.85–87The removal of the His190 residue by mutagenesis shuts down photosynthesis!88–90 Loss of this single base is sufficient to disrupt an enormously complex apparatus with multiply linked functional elements involving thousands and thousands of atoms.
As initially suggested by Babcock, but using a different terminology, and as illustrated in Fig. 16, the culprit is PCET and the importance of driving force on YZ oxidation. Oxidation of tyrosine by electron transfer without the loss of the acidic proton, eq. c in Fig. 16, occurs with E°′ (TyrZOH·+/0) ∼ 1.5 V. This makes oxidation of YZ by P680+ unfavorable by ΔG°′ ∼ +0.2 eV. The uphill nature of this reaction disrupts the electron transfer sequence and back electron transfer prevails.
With His190 in place, a Multiple Site-Electron Proton Transfer (MS-EPT) pathway becomes available. In this pathway, simultaneous transfer of an electron (to P680+) and proton (to His190) occurs avoiding TyrZOH·+. Even though more complex than electron transfer, MS-EPT has a considerable thermodynamic advantage with ΔG°′ ∼ −0.2 eV for the reaction in eq. c in Fig. 16.
The S0 → S1 transition; oxidation of the OEC
It has been suggested that PCET and concerted electron-proton transfer also play key mechanistic roles in the oxidative activation of the OEC.35,78 As illustrated in Fig. 16, the oxidative equivalent provided by the first photon is available to the OEC as the TyrZ-His190 EPT pair, TyrZ·⋯+H-His at E°′ ∼ 1.1–1.2 V vs. NHE.35,78 The corresponding EPT couple, TyrZO·⋯+H-His/TyrZO–H⋯His, is thermodynamically capable of water oxidation (E°′ = 0.82 V at pH = 7 vs. NHE) and of driving water oxidation at the OEC. This is not true for the TyrZO·/TyrZO− couple which, in the absence of a coupled proton transfer, can only provide 0.72 V.
In the S0 → S1 transition, the OEC loses one electron and one proton. Oxidation is thought to occur at the “dangling” Mn site in the OEC which is shown in Fig. 17 as Mn(4). Fig. 17 includes a blown up view of the CaMn4 cluster from the structure by Shen et al. which includes coordinated water molecules at Mn(4).79 Assuming the oxidation state distribution Mn(4)IIMnIIIMnIIIMnIV in S0, with the dangling site as MnII, oxidation to MnIII would be expected to greatly enhance the acidity of the bound water molecules. The ΔpKa difference between Mn(OH2)63+ and Mn(OH2)62+ is 10.7.34,35
 Fig. 17  Proposed 1e−/2H+ MS-EPT in S0 → S1 oxidative activation of the OEC.71,72,75 Reproduced in part with permission from ref. 79, © 2011 Nature Publishing Group and 82, © 2004 American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
In the structure of the OEC, Aspartate 61 (Asp61) is in the second coordination sphere within a H-bonding interaction distance of a first coordination sphere water molecule.
As noted above, Asp61 is also the entryway to the proton exit channel to the lumen. Given an anticipated large decrease in pKa between MnII–OH2 and MnIII–OH2 at Mn(4), concerted EPT oxidation, Mn(4)II–OH2– – –−OOC-Asp61 → Mn(4)III–OH– – –H–OOC-Asp61, is favored over electron transfer, Mn(4)II–OH2– – –−OOC-Asp61 → Mn(4)III–OH2+– – –−OOC-Asp61, by 0.059(pKa(Asp61)–pKa(MnIII–OH2)) by avoiding Mn(4)III–OH2+.
This analysis leads to the suggestion that in S0 → S1 oxidative activation, a double proton transfer occurs in concert with electron transfer from Mn(4) to TyrZO· by 1e−/2H+ MS-EPT. In this elementary reaction, long range electron transfer occurs from MnII(4) to YZ· accompanied by 2 concerted proton transfers, one to Asp61 from Mn–OH2 and one from +H-His190 to TyrzO·.
Utilization of PCET continues throughout the Kok cycle with repetitive use of MS-EPT for oxidative activation. It has also been suggested that O⋯O bond formation to give a hydroperoxide intermediate may occur by APT in the S2 → S3 transition followed by with further oxidation and O2 release in S4.6,78
Concluding remarks
Water oxidation, CO2 reduction and related small molecule reactions, including reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia, N2 + 6H+ → 2NH3, are quintessential examples of PCET in action. All are fundamental in energy conversion in biology, in photosynthesis, and in artificial photosynthesis. The role of PCET in water oxidation catalysis is becoming clearer with common elements appearing and utilization of three zones of reactivity: oxidative activation, O⋯O bond formation to give peroxidic intermediates, and their further oxidation with release of oxygen. With this information in hand, and the ability to use synthesis to both control reactivity and incorporate a water oxidation capability into assemblies and at reactive interfaces, we are, hopefully, one step closer in bringing to reality use of modular designs and artificial photosynthesis for the production of solar fuels.

Christopher J. Gagliardi	Christopher J. Gagliardi was born in 1984, and grew up in Hillsborough, New Jersey. He received his B.S. in Chemistry and Biology with high honors from Roger Williams University in Bristol, RI in 2007. At Roger Williams, he worked in the laboratory of Prof. Cliff Timpson where his interest in solar energy conversion and proton coupled electron transfer began. In the fall of 2007, he went to work in the laboratories of Thomas J. Meyer and H. Holden Thorp at UNC Chapel Hill. His Ph.D. work has involved studying the kinetics and thermodynamics of proton coupled electron transfer reactions of amino acids and the fundamental underpinnings of PCET.
Aaron K. Vannucci	Aaron K. Vannucci received his Bachelors of Arts degree from the College of Wooster in 2004. Afterwards Aaron attended graduate school in the department of chemistry and biochemistry at The University of Arizona. While there, he worked under Prof. Dennis L. Lichtenberger combining electrochemical, spectroscopic and computational techniques to study hydrogenase inspired catalysts. In 2009 Aaron was awarded his Ph.D. in chemistry, and accepted a post doctorial position at Arizona. One year later, Aaron accepted a postdoc position at UNC Chapel Hill working with Thomas J. Meyer studying electrocatalytic hydrocarbon oxidation/functionalization mechanisms of metal oxide bound Ru-oxo catalysts.
Javier J. Concepcion	Javier J. Concepcion received his B.S. from Central University of Las Villas in Cuba and his Ph.D. from Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Following postdoctoral work at Georgia Tech, he served as Assistant Professor at Kennesaw State University for one year before continuing postdoctoral research at UNC-CH. His research interests include solar energy conversion, water oxidation, proton-coupled electron transfer, and computational chemistry.
Zuofeng Chen	Dr Zuofeng Chen was born in 1979 in Fujian, China. He received his M.Sc degree with Professor Yan-Xia Jiang and Professor Shi-Gang Sun in Department of Chemistry at Xiamen University in 2005. He then moved to the University of Hong Kong to start his Ph.D. with Dr Yanbing Zu and Professor Vivian Wing-Wah Yam. In 2009, Dr Chen joined the laboratory of Thomas J. Meyer in the Department of Chemistry at UNC Chapel Hill, where his current research focus is on the catalysis of water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction in solar fuels production and proton coupled electron transfer.
Thomas J. Meyer	Thomas J. Meyer first identified Proton Coupled Electron Transfer and designed the first molecular water catalyst. He was an early pioneer in the field of Artificial Photosynthesis and Solar fuels beginning with research published in the 1970's. He has gained an international reputation in photochemistry, mechanisms, and chemical reactivity and catalysis. He is currently Arey Professor of Chemistry at UNC-Chapel Hill and Director of the UNC Energy Frontier Research Center. In addition to PCET, his group is focused on water oxidation, carbon dioxide reduction, and photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting and reduction of carbon dioxide.

Broader context
Water oxidation is a key half reaction in energy conversion schemes based on solar fuels with light-driven water splitting or carbon dioxide reduction into CO, other oxygenates, or hydrocarbons notable targets. Water oxidation is the key “other” half reaction in these schemes. With its multi-electron, multi-proton character, 2H2O → O2 + 4e− + 4H+, it is dominated by proton coupled electron transfer (PCET). Single site Ru complex catalysts have been identified which undergo stepwise PCET oxidation from RuII–OH22+ to RuIV=O2+ or RuV(O)3+. The higher oxidation state oxo complexes undergo O-atom transfer with water giving peroxidic intermediates which undergo further oxidation and O2 release. PCET plays an important role in the three zones of water oxidation reactivity: oxidative activation, O⋯O bond formation, and oxidation and O2 release. It has been shown that water oxidation reactivity is retained on oxide surfaces and that significant rate accelerations occur with added proton acceptor bases by “Atom Proton Transfer” pathways and in propylene carbonate with water added as a stoichiometric reagent. Lessons learned about water oxidation and the role of PCET have direct relevance for water oxidation in Photosystem II (PSII), with PSII a spectacular example of PCET in action.
