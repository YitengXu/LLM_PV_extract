    , Accepted 5th February 2019First published on 5th February 2019AbstractHerein, the effect of non-conjugated ester functionalization at the 5,6-position of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) in a donor (D)–acceptor (A) conjugated polymer (CP) used for photovoltaic devices has been investigated. Positions 5 and 6 of BT were functionalized with methyl acetate groups and the structure property relationship was compared to BT with methyl groups at the 5 and 6 positions in four types of D–A CPs. Alternate co-polymers of newly synthesized methyl and methyl acetate derivatives of BT and Th–BT–Th with commonly used donors such as dithiophene (DTh) and benzodithiophene (BDT) were synthesized using Stille coupling reactions: namely, P(1,2,3,4)-Me and P(1,2,3,4)-Ac. All CPs were extensively characterized using GPC, UV-visible, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, TGA and CV. The optimized geometry, along with changes in the dihedral angle upon substitution with acetate groups, was analyzed by density functional theory (DFT) using B3LYP/6-31G(d,p). The side chain ester groups lower the dihedral angle, improve the optical and electrochemical properties of CPs in polymer solar cells (PSCs), improve phase separation of the active layer and performance of the fabricated PSCs compared to methyl counterparts, as investigated for P(1,2,3,4)-Me and P(1,2,3,4)-Ac. Upon fabrication of a BHJ solar cell with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P-PC71BM/LiF/Al device geometry, CPs with methyl acetate functionalization (P2-Ac, P3-Ac and P4-Ac) resulted in higher PCEs of 1.36%, 1.17% and 0.35%, compared to their methyl counterpart CPs, P2-Me, P3-Me and P4-Me, which exhibited PCEs of 0.9%, 0.54% and 0.31%, respectively. With 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive, a higher PCE of 1.96% was achieved for P3-Ac. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and thin film X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to determine the impact of side chain ester groups on π–π stacking distance among CP main chains in the film state and the morphology of the active layer of the fabricated PSCs, respectively.
Introduction
Harvesting solar energy using a donor (D)–acceptor (A) blend containing p-type conjugated polymer (CP) donors and n-type fullerene/non-fullerene-based acceptors in bulk-heterojunction1 inverted2/ternary3–5/tandem6 polymer solar cells (PSCs) has led to the attainment of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 11–13%1,7 and device lifespans of about 7 years.8 Aside from designing several acceptors (fullerene/non-fullerene)9 and device engineering, the journey to a PCE of >11% has been viable during the last 10–15 years due to the large number of CPs with desired properties, including: (i) absorption maxima in the 700–800 nm region of the solar spectrum with molar absorption coefficients in the order of 5 × 103 L mol−1 cm−1; (ii) hole mobility in the order of 1 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1; and (iii) suitably positioned HOMOs and LUMOs corresponding to the n-type acceptor used for blending during fabrication. To further increase the PCE and establish an in-depth structure property relationship, it is necessary to design new backbones and modify old ones. Though the major focus of modifications has been on the donor CP main chain,10,11 various research groups have also functionalized the side chains of these CPs, to create compounds such as a phosphite functionalized side chain CP (used as an electron transporting layer12 and additional interlayer),13,14 side chain cyanide substituted CP (reported to improve dielectric constant)15 and azide substituted CP (to improve crosslinking properties),16 along with the incorporation of functional groups to enhance solubility.17
Moreover, significant efforts have also been dedicated to improving the active layer morphology to enhance the charge separation and to reduce the recombination of generated excitons. An optimized active layer (polymer–PCBM/non-fullerene) morphology of a PSC device should exhibit low aggregation,18,19 possess an ordered/crystalline film with a bi-continuous phase20–22 and have low RMS roughness with a small grain size.23 These preferred morphological variations have been achieved mainly by: (i) the use of additives24,25/mixtures of solvents13/solvents to enhance solubility of the active layer,26 as preferential solubility of PCBM in one solvent over another allows for stepwise deposition of the blend layer sequentially, providing appropriate phase separation in the active layer and offering a distinct path for the transport of holes and electrons; and (ii) high temperature annealing27 during device fabrication, providing sufficient energy for the film to be well organized or upside-down solvent vapor annealing.28 In addition, the incorporation of functional groups, such as fluorine, oxygen and nitrogen, into the CP backbone has also been shown to be a proficient approach to improving the morphology.29–31
In line with the discussion of designing CPs as solar harvesters with good photophysical properties, mobility and functional groups that improve the morphology of active layer, it is worth mentioning that CPs with main/side chain substituted functional groups, such as fluorine, oxygen, sulfur, ester, ketone, cyanide and azide,10,16,32–35 are often synthesized to improve solar cell performance. Such functional groups lower the dihedral angle within CPs and bring planarity and linearity into it,11 leading to improved π–π stacking in the film state with desired morphology.36 The reason for the improvement of PSC performance in the case of main chain/side chain functionalized CPs is the enhanced intra-molecular/inter-molecular oxygen–sulfur (O–S)/fluorine–hydrogen (F–H)/nitrogen–hydrogen (N–H)/oxygen–hydrogen (O–H) interactions of CP chains in the film state.16,37–39 This improves the optical properties in the film state and segregation between CP and PCBM (acceptor), due to enhanced interactions within the polymer–polymer chain, which repel the PCBM and give the most desired morphology, namely segregation, rather than the undesired morphology, called aggregation.
The ester group is one such important functional group, being used both in the side chain and main chain of CPs for solar cells. It has been reported that ester groups improve the thermal stability of fabricated devices due to crosslinking,40,41 while the thermo-cleavable nature of ester groups endows the active layer of the PSC with resistance to solvents during multilayer device fabrication,42 imparts promising solubility and mobility43 and improves the morphology of the active layer in PSCs as well.44
Herein, BT was modified with methyl acetate groups substituted as side chains at the 5 and 6 positions of BT (Fig. 1) to improve the design and synthesis of acceptor units. The synthesis of D–A types of CPs was carried out (namely P1-Ac, P2-Ac, P3-Ac, P4-Ac) from corresponding ester functionalized BT-based acceptors with commonly used donors (D1, D2, D3 and D4, Fig. 2) using Stille coupling. Corresponding methyl counterpart CPs (namely P1-Me, P2-Me, P3-Me and P4-Me) were also synthesized to compare the influence of ester groups at the 5 and 6 positions of BT. Herein, it was established that side chain ester groups at the 5 and 6 positions of BT: (i) can lower the dihedral angle along the conjugated main chain, resulting in an increase in the molar absorption coefficient; (ii) redshift the absorption spectra in the film state; (iii) lower the optical LUMO level due to the electron withdrawing nature; and (iv) enhance the solar cell performance of CP compared to its methyl counterparts. These enhanced properties of side chain ester groups are due to oxygen–sulfur (O–S)/π–π and CH–π interactions, both within the CP chain and/or inter-molecularly in the film state of CP and/or CP–PCBM blend.

General synthetic methodology for polymerization using Stille coupling. 
Donor monomer (D1/D2/D3/D4) and acceptor monomer (3/5/7/9) in a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 were taken into a 50 mL reaction flask and 25 mL of dry toluene was added to the mixture. Before the addition of 0.2 equivalents of Pd(PPh3)4, the mixture was purged with argon for 5 minutes. It was then degassed and purged with argon three times. It was then refluxed at 100 °C for 72 hours in the presence of Ar. After reducing the temperature to 25 °C, the crude product was concentrated and precipitated into 400 mL of methyl alcohol. The precipitates were collected and washed with MeOH, dried and then dissolved in chloroform.

Results and discussion
Theoretical calculations
The influence of ester groups on the HOMO/LUMO levels and the effect of the dihedral angle between conjugated units of the polymers were studied using DFT calculations at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p). For simplification, methyl chains were used for any kind of alkyl chain and investigations on all CPs were carried out on one unit of each CP. Ester functionalized CPs displayed required distribution of charge density for intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) from donor to acceptor (distribution of charge density all over HOMO and localization of charge density on acceptor only in LUMO)46 in all four CPs [P(1,2,3,4)-Ac] with 4 different donors (D1 to D4). The ester functionalized CPs had low dihedral angles in the case of D2 and D4 compared to their methyl counterparts (Fig. 3c, d, g and h), due to possible oxygen (negatively charged in the ester group)–sulfur (positively charged in the thiophene ring) interactions. However, in the case of D1 and D3, the dihedral angle was increased in the ester functionalized CPs (Fig. 3a, b, e and f) compared to their methyl counterparts. This is due to steric hindrance caused by D1 having two dodecyl chains in close proximity (at 3,3′) and the bulkiness of D3 (due to two thiophene substituted 2-ethylhexyl chain on BDT), which predominates over any possible oxygen–sulfur interactions. In the case of D2 and D4, the dihedral angle was reduced by 10° in the ester substituted CP.

Optical properties
UV-visible spectra for both the methyl acetate substituted CPs [P(1,2,3,4)-Ac] and the methyl substituted CPs [P(1,2,3,4)-Me] at the 5 and 6 positions of BT were recorded in dilute CHCl3 solution and in the film state (drop casted from chlorobenzene). A comparison of the absorption properties for both solution and film shows a bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum of the ICT transition and the absorption onset, with broadening of the UV-visible spectra for the ester functionalized CPs compared to their methyl counterparts (Table 1 and Fig. 4a–d). All CPs exhibit a tri-humped peak (Fig. 4a–d) both in solution and in the film state, which is related to the high energy intrinsic band of the donor only, moderate energy π–π* transition of the CP backbone and low-energy ICT band.47 In the film state, the intrinsic bands of P1-Me, P1-Ac and P2-Me are not clearly visible due to the broadening of spectra (Fig. 4a and b). In the solution state, in addition to the small variation in the intrinsic band and π–π* band, a redshift in the ICT transition was observed for the methyl acetate substituted CPs compared to their methyl counterparts. In the film state a significant bathochromic shift of absorption spectra was observed along with peak broadening for λmax (ICT band) and/or UV-visible (onset), signifying a substantial π–π stacking of the CP main chain (Fig. 4a–d),48 when side chain esters were introduced into it, due to enhanced CH–π, π–π and oxygen–sulfur interactions (intramolecular and intermolecular). The molar absorption coefficient (ε) of the π–π* band and ICT band in CHCl3 was higher for ester substituted CPs P2-Ac (27373, 26197 L mol−1 cm−1) and P4-Ac (29827, 20113 L mol−1 cm−1) compared to the methyl substituted CPs P2-Me (13820, 15372 L mol−1 cm−1) and P4-Me (18124, 19819 L mol−1 cm−1) respectively (Table 1), due to the lowering of the dihedral angle. However, the molar absorption coefficients of the ester substituted CPs P1-Ac and P3-Ac are lowered compared to their methyl counterparts P1-Me and P3-Me, due to the larger dihedral angles in ester substituted CPs. The larger dihedral angles are caused by the sterically hindered donor D1 (Fig. 2) with its closely positioned dodecyl chains1 in the case of P1-Ac and the bulky 2-ethylhexylthiophene substituted BDT-Th donor D3 (Fig. 2) in the case of P3-Ac. D1 and D3 predominantly control the structure, eliminating possible oxygen–sulfur interactions between ester groups and nearby Th-units which could stabilize the structure.

 Fig. 4  Absorption spectra of synthesized CPs, showing redshift and broadening of spectra for methyl acetate substituted CPs compared to their methyl counterparts. 
Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry was carried out for all the synthesized CPs, revealing oxidation potentials only within the range of −0.6 V to −1.04 V (Fig. 5a and b). Calculated HOMOs of all CPs were in the range of −5.36 to −5.6 eV. The HOMO of P1-Ac was found to be 0.11 eV deeper than that of P1-Me (Table 1), which might be due to the high steric hindrance of donor D1, leading to a weak donating tendency to the acceptor BT with the methyl acetate groups (the higher the π-electron donating tendency of the donor in the D–A CP, the higher the HOMO). Minor fluctuations (maximum observed change 0.03 eV) in the HOMO levels was observed49 in P2-Ac, P3-Ac and P4-Ac, compared to their methyl counterparts. This indicated the reduced effect of the ester groups on the HOMOs of the synthesized CPs and the decreased influence of methyl acetate groups on the photophysical properties, which are purely due to LUMO contributions. None of the CPs exhibited a reduction potential, hence their LUMOoptical values were calculated from the absorption onsets using the formula: band gap = λonset/1240 and LUMOopt = HOMO + band gap. As all of the ester substituted CPs show a high absorption onset, all the ester functionalized CPs show a low LUMOopt compared to their methyl counterparts. The low-lying LUMOopt in the ester functionalized CPs will help to improve charge separation in the active layer of fabricated PSCs due to the small energy barrier between the LUMO levels of CP and PC71BM.50

Thermal stability of polymers
The thermal stability of all the side chain ester and methyl functionalized CPs were investigated using TGA analysis under a nitrogen atmosphere. All CPs were found to be stable up to 250 °C, corresponding to 5% weight loss of CP (Table 1 and Fig. 6a and b) on a constant heating rate of 10 °C per minute, which is an adequate temperature for device fabrication.51,52 However, there was one exception, as the sticky-natured CP P1-Me started degrading at less than 100 °C (Fig. 6a), corresponding to 5% weight loss, which might have occurred due to the presence of moisture (perhaps responsible for its sticky nature). In Table 1 for P3, T10D (degradation corresponding to 10% weight loss) occurs at 368 °C. All ester functionalized CPs have low T5D values and show bi-humped degradation patterns compared to their methyl counterparts (Fig. 6a and b), which might be due to the fragile/thermocleavable nature of the side chain ester groups (here methyl acetate).42

Solar cell performance
Both the methyl ester and methyl functionalized BT-based CPs were used with PC71BM to fabricate PSCs with similar device architectures (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CP:PC71BM (1:1)/LiF/Al), to establish the influence of side chain ester groups on solar cell performance. It was established that ester substituted CPs (P(2,3,4)-Ac) show higher solar cell performance (PCE, Voc and Jsc) than their methyl counterpart CPs (P(2,3,4)-Me). Using P2-Me:PC71BM (1:1) as the active layer, a PCE of 0.9% (Jsc = 5.09 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.68 V and FF = 26.2%) was achieved, whereas ester functionalized CP P2-Ac in a similar device configuration resulted in a PCE of 1.36% with a Jsc value of 7.4 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.69 V and FF of 26.5% (Table 2 and Fig. 7a). Similarly, with ester functionalized CP P3-Ac, a PCE of 1.17% (Jsc = 7.65 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.63 V, FF = 29.3%) was achieved, compared to a PCE of 0.54% (Jsc = 3.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.57 V, FF = 27.1%) for the methyl counterpart (P3-Me). The unexpected variation of Voc with respect to the HOMOs of the P3 set of polymers might be due to differences in the side chains, from methyl (P3-Me) to acetate (P3-Ac). This dissimilarity of the side chains changes the intermolecular interaction of the polymer with PC71BM53,54 and affects the Voc as well. The PSC performance of P3-Ac further improved to a PCE of 1.96% by the use of 3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive into the active layer (Table 2 and Fig. 7a).24 The reason for the improvement of the PSC performance with DIO is mainly due to film reorganization and better phase separation (Fig. 8c).55

The phase separation further improved to a large extent when 3% DIO was added to P3-Ac:PC71BM (1:1). (a) P3-Me:PC71BM (1:1); (b) P3-Ac:PC71BM (1:1); (c) P3-Ac:PC71BM (1:1)-3% DIO. 

P4-Me and P4-Ac follow similar patterns to those of P2-Me and P2-Ac in the fabricated devices, with PCEs of 0.35% (P4-Ac) and 0.31% (P4-Me). The solar cell performance for P4-Me and P4-Ac (CP with DTh as a donor) was very poor (PCEs in the range of 0.3%) compared to the BDT based CPs. This is due to the poor film forming ability of P4-Me and P4-Ac with high dihedral angles (∼18°) between the two thiophene units (Fig. 3d) of the donor dithiophene (DTh), leading to low rigidity of the CP backbone and hence poor film forming properties.56 Moreover, a maximum external quantum efficiency of 37% (Fig. 7b) was achieved when using P3-Ac:PC71BM (1:1)-3% (DIO) as the active layer in the fabricated solar cells. An improvement in the EQE values was also observed alongside the PCEs in the case of the ester functionalized CPs compared to their methyl counterparts. This confirmed that side chain ester groups at the 5 and 6 positions of BT improve the solar cell performance, as revealed in three different sets of CPs with three different donors (D2, D3, D4). In addition, P1-Ac:PC71BM (2:1) showed a PCE of 0.02% (Jsc = 0.50 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.17 V and FF = 26.2%), which is too low to study any comparison with its methyl counterpart P1-Me. Both P1-Me and P1-Ac showed very poor film forming properties, due to the high dihedral angles along their conjugated main chains.57 The reasons for the improvement in solar cell performance in the case of the ester substituted CPs are: the higher absorption range (red region); better phase separation in the active layer due to the crosslinking nature of the ester groups within CP and/or PC71BM; improved ICT due to reduced dihedral angles along the conjugated main chain; and lowered LUMOs, which facilitate ease of separation of excitons from the LUMO of the CP to the LUMO of PC71BM.
Morphology of active layer of fabricated PSCs
Tapping mode AFM images were recorded to investigate the nano-morphology of the active layer in the fabricated devices. Samples were prepared by spin-coating a polymer:PC71BM blend on a pre-cleaned ITO coated glass slide. Comparing P3-Me:PC71BM (1:1), P3-Ac:PC71BM (1:1) and P3-Ac:PC71BM (1:1) containing DIO, it was observed that all polymer–PC71BM blends have proper miscibility in the active layer with RMS (root mean square) roughnesses of less than 3 nm.47 The ester functionalized polymer P3-Ac results in better phase separation between P3-Ac and PC71BM in the blend film compared to its methyl counterpart P3-Me (Fig. 8a and b). When 3% DIO was added into P3-Ac:PC71BM (1:1), a significant improvement of phase separation55,58 was observed (Fig. 8c), allowing a distinguished path for electrons and holes to travel and reducing the recombination of generated excitons (as can be seen in the height and 3D view of the images in Fig. 8). As a result, the PCE improved to 1.96% with P3-Ac:PC71BM (1:1)-3% DIO as the active layer. This further confirms the positive influence of side chain ester groups in increasing the crystallinity59 in the active layer of the fabricated PSCs with tunability using external effects such as additives and various solvent processing techniques.
Thin film X-ray diffraction pattern
Thin film X-ray diffraction was carried out by spin-coating equal concentrations of methyl and corresponding ester substituted CPs, in order to investigate the influence on the π–π stacking distance in the thin-film state with side chain ester substitution at the 5 and 6 positions of BT. For P4-Me and P4-Ac, diffraction peaks were observed at 2θ = 24.21° and 25.2°, corresponding to 0.3673 nm and 0.3531 nm π–π stacking distances, respectively (Fig. S1c, ESI†). The close π–π stacking distance in the case of the ester substituted CP P4-Ac compared to P4-Me further confirms the improved π–π stacking within CP chains in the film state and hence better solar cell performance.10,60 In addition, for P3-Me and P3-Ac, ester substitution at the 5 and 6 positions of BT CP P3-Ac led to a similar/small increase in the π–π stacking distance (2θ = 23.16°, π–π stacking distance = 0.3837 nm), which is obvious from the small increase in the dihedral angle (Fig. S1b, ESI†) (determined by DFT) compared to the methyl counterpart P3-Me (2θ = 23.25°, π–π stacking distance = 0.3822 nm). Similarly, in the case of P2-Me and P2-Ac, no change in the π–π distance was observed (Fig. S1a, ESI†) in DTh and BDT-Th. All newly synthesized methyl and methyl acetate substituted 5,6-BT-based CPs showed good solubility in commonly used solvents for device fabrication (CB, DCB, CHCl3, THF). Additionally, the ester substituted CPs were stable up to 250 °C.
Conclusion
It has been established in this study that functionalizing ester groups at the 5 and 6 positions of BT reduces the dihedral angle in the CP backbone due to oxygen–sulfur interactions, improves π–π stacking in the film leading to redshifting and broadening of absorption spectra, lowers the LUMOoptical of the CPs, improves phase separation of the active layer in the fabricated solar cells and hence improves the solar cell performance compared to the methyl counterparts. This phase separation can be further enhanced using additives; in the case of P3-Ac:PC71BM, the PCE of 1.17% was improved to 1.96% by the addition of 3% DIO as an additive. Ester groups, which endow CP films with good photophysical and morphological properties, can be introduced as side chains in synthetically feasible conjugated units and used to synthesize CPs with superior properties for solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.
