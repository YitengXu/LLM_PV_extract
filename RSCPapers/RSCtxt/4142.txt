    , Accepted 28th January 2019First published on 28th January 2019AbstractHybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention because of their advantages of a high power conversion efficiency and low fabrication cost. Their efficiencies have skyrocketed from 3% to over 22% just within few years of research. Interlayer engineering is an efficient method for further improving the performance of planar perovskite solar cells. There are two types of materials widely applied for interfaces. Organic interlayers can be easily processed, yet they have lower stability under light or at elevated temperatures. Metal oxide interlayers require costlier and, more importantly, higher temperature processing methods which lead to degradation of the underlying perovskite layer. In this work, we propose tin(II) sulfide (SnS), a IV–VI semiconductor, as an interlayer material to replace bathocuproine (BCP) for electron collection. The deposition of the interlayer is achieved by thermal evaporation, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the optimized device reached up to 18.40%. With a comparable PCE and improved stability, SnS can replace BCP successfully. Additionally, we explored devices with fully inorganic interlayers by employing a metal oxide as the hole transport interlayer. This method further increased the stability.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as the most promising next-generation solar cell technology owing to their advantages of a high power conversion efficiency and low fabrication cost.1 The high photovoltaic efficiency is related to the optoelectronic properties of perovskites, such as appropriate bandgaps and long charge carrier lifetimes and diffusion length.2,3 These unique attributes have helped achieve certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 22% in a couple of years,4 which has surpassed that of other thin film solar cell technologies such as amorphous silicon, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), CdTe, kesterite and organic solar cells. PCEs depend on the optoelectronic properties of perovskites and the interfaces between the perovskite layer and electrodes. In addition to the efforts in optimizing the quality and composition of the perovskite layer,5–10 research has been carried out to search for appropriate materials for interlayers between the perovskite layer and electrodes. Interlayers can improve the charge carrier collection because they give rise to better energy level matching11 and/or eliminate surface induced traps.12 Apart from being major determinants of PCEs, both the perovskite and the interlayer can affect the photovoltaic stability of PSCs. In fact, the stability is a big obstacle for the practical application of PSCs. The photovoltaic stability of PSCs is mainly related to the degradation of perovskites caused by moisture and oxygen. This problem can be alleviated if interlayers can have good stability and serve as an effective barrier against moisture and oxygen.
Both organic and inorganic materials have been studied as the interlayer of PSCs. Organic/polymeric interlayer materials can be usually deposited using solution processing techniques. However, these materials usually have a conjugated structure and low stability. For example, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) which has been commonly used as the hole-collection interlayer of PSCs13 is highly hygroscopic.14 However, bathocuproine (BCP), which is a popular electron-collection interlayer material, may be employed in stable PSCs when there is an additional passivation layer on top of the perovskite layer to prevent degradation of the perovskite layer.15 However, BCP itself is degraded by moisture16 or delaminated from the underlying layers due to temperature-dependent recrystallization.17 Metal oxides can have better stability against moisture, oxygen and UV light than organic materials, and they have been investigated as the interlayer material of PSCs, such as TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, NiOx, CuO, Cu2O, BaSnO3 and WO3.18–26 Although oxide layers below the perovskite layer can be deposited using a solution processing technique, depositing an inorganic layer on top of the perovskite layer by solution processing or thermal deposition can degrade the perovskite layer due to water or high temperature. Thus, an inorganic interlayer like ZnO above the perovskite layer can be deposited by sputtering only with an additional layer to cover the perovskite layer.20 However, sputtering is expensive and the high temperature during sputtering can degrade the perovskite layer as well. This is especially important for tandem devices where the oxide layer can damage the underlying perovskite layer even in the presence of a protective interlayer.18 Apart from oxides, CuSCN27 and LiF28,29 were investigated as the interlayer of PSCs. Yet, CuSCN has a critical problem of instability27 and a thin layer of LiF cannot create a barrier for humidity.30
In this work, SnS, a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor, was studied to replace bathocuproine (BCP) as the electron collection interlayer of inverted PSCs. Its melting point is only 882 °C, significantly lower than that of many oxides. It can be thus deposited by using a normal thermal evaporator. The PSCs with a SnS interlayer can exhibit a PCE of up to 18.4% under AM1.5 illumination and good photovoltaic stability. We also demonstrated stable PSCs with inorganic materials as interlayers for both electron and hole collection, specifically, SnS for electron collection and NiOx for hole collection.
2. Results and discussion
Careful selection of the interlayer material is important to achieve high PCEs for PSCs. BCP is a popular material for electron collection between the Ag electrode and the C60 layer of inverted planar PSCs. It can be thermally deposited, and it can decrease the leakage current of PSCs.31 However, its stability is a concern as it is a conjugated organic molecule. SnS was used to replace BCP for the electron collection of PSCs in this work. Fig. 1 shows the schematic device architecture and the energy level diagram of the materials used for PSCs. The conduction band minimum (CBM) of SnS is −3.7 eV, higher than the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of C60 by 0.2 eV, while it is still higher than the Fermi level of the Ag electrode. Hence, SnS can be an appropriate material for the electron collection of PSCs. Electrons can transport from the conduction band of the perovskite across C60 and the conduction band of SnS, and are finally collected by the Ag electrode. Although the valence band maximum (VBM) of SnS is −5.0 eV, higher than the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of BCP, it does not affect the hole collection adversely because the holes should be blocked by the C60 layer which has a lower lying HOMO.

SnS was deposited by using a normal thermal evaporator. We fabricated PSCs with a SnS layer of different thicknesses. The J–V curves of the PSCs with SnS layers of 1, 3 and 10 nm thicknesses are shown in Fig. 2. The J–V curves of control devices, ITO/PTAA/perovskite/C60/Ag and ITO/PTAA/perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag, are presented as well. The photovoltaic performances of these devices are summarized in Table 1. Compared with the device with the ITO/PTAA/perovskite/C60/Ag structure without an electron-collection interlayer, it can be found that the presence of a SnS interlayer can significantly improve the fill factor (FF) and thus the PCE. The FF value is only 0.64 for the control PSCs without an electron-collection layer, while it increases to 0.73 for the PSC with a 3 nm-thick SnS interlayer. Accordingly, the PCE increases from 15.99% to 18.40%. The improvement in the FF arises mainly from the increase in the shunt resistance. The optimal SnS thickness is 3–5 nm in terms of PCE. When the SnS layer thickness is further increased, the FF of the PSC decreases due to the increase in the series resistance. The optimized PCE of the PSCs with SnS is 18.40%, quite close to that (18.88%) of the control device with an 8 nm-thick BCP layer. The high Jsc (22 mA cm−2) calculated from IPCE data (Fig. S1†) agrees well with the one that is observed from the J–V curve.

Although PTAA as a hole collection material can give rise to better stability than PEDOT:PSS, it is a polymer with a conjugated structure. Its stability is still a major concern. We fabricated PSCs with inorganic materials for both hole and electron collection by substituting PTAA with NiOx (Fig. 3). The photovoltaic performances of PSCs with NiOx are summarized in Table 2. Similar to a PTAA-based device, insertion of the 3 nm-thick SnS layer increases Rsh, thus leading to a higher Voc and fill factor for NiOx-based PSCs (Table 2). The optimal PCE of the PSC, ITO/NiOx/perovskite/C60/SnS/Ag, is 16.16%. It is significantly higher than that (13.71%) of the control device of ITO/NiOx/perovskite/C60/Ag without an electron-collection interlayer and close to that (16.52%) of the control device with BCP.

The increase in charge collection by SnS is evidenced by the time resolved photoluminescence spectra (TR-PL) of the perovskite thin film and its respective interlayers. As shown in Fig. 4, the perovskite film without any hole or electron collection interlayer exhibits a long exciton lifetime of 332 ns. The exciton lifetime for the perovskite on PTAA or NiOx obtained by analyzing the TR-PL spectra is 8.6 and 15.7 ns, respectively.32 It is 15.6 ns for perovskite/C60. The addition of another electron collection layer can further lower the exciton lifetime. It decreases to 6.2 ns for perovskite/C60/SnS. This lifetime is even shorter than that (9.1 ns) of perovskite/C60/BCP. Hence, the presence of a SnS or BCP layer can help efficiently extract electrons from the perovskite layer and lead to a higher photovoltaic efficiency.13,33

A SnS layer on perovskite/C60 does not remarkably affect the surface morphology (Fig. 5). The grains observed on perovskite/C60/SnS are quite similar to those on the perovskite and perovskite/C60. This suggests that SnS may not agglomerate on the C60 layer. Presumably, SnS can have good wettability on C60, and thus the SnS layer can fully cover the C60 layer. This is further supported by the uniform distribution of Sn and S on C60 (Fig. S2†).

The stabilities of the devices without encapsulation were tested under continuous illumination with consecutive measurements (Fig. 6) and maximum power point tracking (Fig. 7). The PSCs with PTAA exhibit poorer stability than those with NiOx. This finding is consistent with those reported in the literature.34–37 Even for the devices with PTAA, SnS always gives rise to better stability than BCP. The best stability was observed for the devices with NiOx for hole collection and SnS for electron collection. The device with NiOx and SnS interlayers retained more than 70% of the original efficiency after operating for 40 h at 25 °C and 80% relative humidity in air. Instead, the efficiency of the devices with NiOx and BCP drops to about 40% under the same conditions.

The photovoltaic stability of PSCs is related to the degradation of the perovskites. It is commonly accepted that in the presence of humidity and moisture, the perovskite phase degrades into PbI2 and perovskite hydrates.38,39 The structure of perovskites covered with C60, C60/BCP and C60/SnS was studied with X-ray diffraction (XRD). For the perovskite films kept in humid air, perovskite (14.2°), PbI2 (12.9°) and perovskite hydrate (10.6°) peaks were observed (Fig. S3, ESI†). The peaks of degradation products, PbI2 and perovskite hydrate, are present even in the patterns of freshly prepared samples (day 0); this is likely caused by XRD measurements being carried out in open air where the perovskite can start to degrade. We compared the evolution of the peaks through time (Fig. S4, ESI†). 80% of the perovskite in the C60/SnS coated film remained undegraded after 10 days in open air. In comparison, only around 40% of the perovskite remained for samples coated with C60/BCP and less than 15% remained for the sample with C60 alone. Of the perovskite thin film samples kept in open air, SnS and C60 coated samples provided a superior structural stability to samples coated with BCP and C60, or C60 alone. This is in line with the observation of better device stability provided by C60/SnS. In addition to the degradation of the perovskite layer, corrosion of the Ag electrode has been shown to have a critical impact on the stability of PSCs.40–42 Even though the encapsulation of devices may provide coverage for external effects such as oxygen and moisture, corrosion of the electrode takes place within the devices due to migration of iodine species (I− and HI) towards Ag and formation of AgI in the electrode.40,41,43 There have been several attempts to block iodine diffusion from the perovskite layer to the electrode by applying impermeable layers and thereby undermining the cause of corrosion.43–45 We investigated the extent of iodine diffusion by performing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on aged devices. Fig. S5† shows the XPS spectra around Ag 3d and I 3d regions for the devices. The large difference between I 3d peaks relative to Ag 3d peaks is apparent for the devices without an interlayer vs. with an interlayer. The atomic ratios calculated for I/Ag are 20.68% for the device without an interlayer, 3.08% for the device with 8 nm BCP and 2.76% for the device with 3 nm SnS. There is no considerable shift in both Ag and I peaks indicating a slow formation of AgI.41 An interlayer between C60 and Ag can slow down the iodine diffusion. The SnS interlayer provides a slightly better coverage from iodine diffusion than BCP, most likely due to its denser structure coupled with better air and humidity protection which may prevent the creation of ion diffusion channels by external effects.41
The hysteresis behaviors of the devices with the SnS electron collection interlayer were tested by consecutive reverse and forward measurements (Fig. S6, ESI†). There is no hysteresis in the J–V curve of the device ITO/PTAA/perovskite/C60/SnS/Ag. A slight hysteresis can be observed in the J–V curves of ITO/NiOx/perovskite/C60/SnS/Ag. This can be attributed to NiOx instead of the SnS layer. It has long been observed that PSCs with metal oxide interlayers are more susceptible to hysteresis problems.46 The origin of hysteresis observed in metal oxide-based PSCs is believed to be caused by the unhindered movement of free ions diffusing out of the perovskite lattice and moving freely with changing bias.47
3. Conclusion
We have demonstrated the use of two-dimensional SnS as an electron collection interlayer in inverted planar perovskite solar cells. The application of the SnS interlayer is facile and effective. It can effectively replace BCP to provide a better stability against moisture, oxygen and UV light with a high PCE of 18.4%. This low cost application of SnS provided an example of stable and abundant inorganic interlayer material for perovskite solar cells. Additionally, by employing NiOx for hole collection, we demonstrated stable PSCs without any organic electron and hole collection interlayers. We believe that the successful application of SnS will provide a foothold for other stable and inexpensive IV–VI semiconductors that are yet to be fully explored in perovskite solar cells.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials and chemicals
Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates (15 ohm □−1) were obtained from the NSG Group. Poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Methylammoniumbromide (MABr) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) were received from Dyesol Ltd. Other chemicals, including lead(II) iodide (PbI2: 99.999% purity), lead(II) bromide (PbBr2: 99.999% purity), C60 (98% purity), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8% purity), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, ≥99.9% purity), dimethylformamide (DMF, ≥99.9% purity), toluene (anhydrous, 99.5% purity), SnS (≥99% purity), and silver (Ag shot, ≥99.99% purity), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All materials were used as received without further purification.
4.2 Materials characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a Bruker D8 Advance XRD instrument. Film thickness values were determined by employing a surface profilometer (KLA Tencor, Alpha-Step IQ). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were acquired with a Zeiss Supra-40 SEM and a Veeco NanoScope IV Multi-Mode AFM operated in the tapping mode, respectively. For the time-resolved photoluminescence measurements, the perovskite thin films were excited with a 515 nm laser. The excitation laser had a frequency of 100 kHz and pulse duration of 200 fs. The scattered excitation light was eliminated with a 532 nm long pass filter. After filtering with a 776 ± 10 nm band pass filter, the emission of the samples was detected with an avalanche photodiode (Micro Photon Devices, PicoQuant). The PL kinetics was measured using a time-correlated single photon counting module (TCSPC PicoHarp 300, PicoQuant). XPS spectra were collected using an Axis Ultra DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The CasaXPS program (2.3.14 version) was employed to subtract the Shirley background, analyze the composition, and deconvolute the XPS peaks.
4.3 Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
The devices with the architecture shown in Fig. 1a were fabricated through the following procedure. ITO glass substrates were cleaned by sonication successively in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. The sonication time was 20 min for each cleaning. They were then dried with a N2 flow and then transferred into a glove box filled with highly pure nitrogen. The PTAA layer was prepared by spin coating a PTAA solution in toluene (2 mg mL−1) at 6000 rpm for 20 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The perovskite layer was deposited by spin coating a solution of 0.9 M PbI2, 0.9 M FAI, 0.1 M PbBr2 and 0.1 M MABr in a co-solvent of DMF/DMSO (4:1 vol. ratio) at 2000 rpm for 10 s and then at 6000 rpm for 60 s. The antisolvent chlorobenzene was dripped at 10 s after the beginning of the second step. The films were then annealed at 100 °C for 15 min in a DMSO environment. The thickness of the perovskite films was around 340 nm. The fabrication of the devices were completed by the thermal deposition of C60 (45 nm thick), SnS, and Ag (100 nm thick) in a vacuum of <1 × 10−6 Torr. The PSCs were encapsulated with UV-curable epoxy and glass sheets in the glovebox for the photovoltaic testing except the stability measurements. Each device had an active area of 0.11 cm2.
The devices were tested under ambient conditions with a Keithley 2400 source-meter unit. The photocurrent for the devices was measured with a Newport's Oriel Xenon arc lamp solar simulator under AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2), which was calibrated using a standard Si (J115711-1-Si detector) photodiode detector. A mask was used during the photovoltaic tests.
