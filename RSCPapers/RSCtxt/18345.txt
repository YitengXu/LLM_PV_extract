    , Accepted 16th February 2018First published on 16th February 2018AbstractThe amount of adsorbed Fe(III) on BiVO4 particles, which is controlled by the pH and temperature of the reaction solution, strongly affects the photocatalytic performance of BiVO4 for Fe(III) reduction. Quantum and solar-energy-conversion efficiencies of 38% and 0.65%, respectively, were achieved.
Photocatalytic water splitting into H2 and O2 using limitless solar light is regarded as a promising solution to address both environmental and energy-shortage issues.1–8 In order to efficiently harness solar energy, high quantum efficiencies over the wide visible-light spectrum is necessary. We first demonstrated visible-light-induced water splitting via a Z-scheme system9,10 using Pt-loaded SrTiO3:Cr/Ta11 as the photosystem (PS) for H2 evolution (PSI (H2), Fig. 1(a)), PtOx-loaded WO3 for O2 evolution (PSII (O2)), and IO3−/I− as the redox mediator. A variety of semiconductor photocatalysts and redox mediators, such as Fe(III)/Fe(II), VO2+/VO2+, and Co(bpy)33+/2+, have been reported.4,6,12–16 However, the efficiencies of these Z-scheme systems are insufficient for practical use.7 Recently, we studied a photocatalysis–electrolysis hybrid system based on a Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox mediator17,18 as another method for practical water splitting, in which PSI (H2) in the Z-scheme system is replaced via electrolysis (Fig. 1(b)). In systems using a Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox mediator, solar energy is converted and stably accumulated in the redox solution as chemical energy through the photocatalytic PSII (O2) reaction, with positive ΔG (eqn (1)): (1)

In the electrolytic system (ES (H2)), H2 is produced under the conditions that use accumulated Fe(II) with a low applied bias of less than 0.8 V17, owing to the low redox potential and low overpotential associated with Fe(II) oxidation (eqn (2)),19,20 resulting in the overall splitting of water into H2 and O2 (eqn (3) (eqn (1) + (2)). (2) (3)
Pure H2 is produced separately from O2 and accumulates easily in the closed cathode chamber; the wide closed cover over the photocatalysis pool typically used for H2 accumulation is not required. H2 can be produced on demand because Fe(II) ions accumulate stably in aqueous solutions over long times. Consequently, H2 can be obtained with lower cost compared to a conventional water electrolysis technique even if any energy resources such as solar or wind power is used, because the applied bias for ES (H2) using Fe(II) can be decreased by half compared to that of the conventional water electrolysis, which is generally more than 1.6 V owing to the high overpotential associated with O2 production (1.23 V + overpotential).18 We have reported that the photocatalytic activity of WO3 powder for the PSII (O2) reaction using Fe(III) is much improved by its surface treatment with Cs+ ions (quantum efficiency: 31% at 420 nm, solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency: 0.38%).21 However, the activity of WO3 is inadequate because it absorbs only visible light of wavelengths up to 460 nm. Therefore, the application of efficient photocatalysts that can harvest the wide spectrum of visible light is important for photocatalytic water splitting. BiVO4 can absorb visible light up to 520 nm and has been used for the PSII (O2) reaction in Z-scheme water-splitting systems using a Fe(III)/(II) redox mediator.16,22,23 BiVO4 is synthesized via a solid-state reaction,24 hydrothermally, or via homogeneous-precipitation methods.23,25–28 However, in the case of the powdered system, the highest reported quantum efficiency for BiVO4 remains low, at 18.3% at 440 nm;23 this efficiency was evaluated using Ag(I), which is an irreversible electron scavenger. In the PSII (O2) reaction using Fe(III), the undesirable Fe(II) reoxidation process (0.77 V vs. RHE) also occurs instead of water oxidation (1.23 V vs. RHE) due to thermodynamic advantages. Therefore, in the photocatalytic reaction using a reversible redox mediator, the evaluation of photocatalytic performance containing the undesirable process such as Fe(II) reoxidation is important. In the present study, we evaluated the photocatalytic performance of the PSII (O2) reaction using Fe(III) over BiVO4, prepared via a liquid–solid-state (LSR) method at various preparation temperatures, because this synthesis method is simple and tractable. In addition, we elucidated the factors affecting the photocatalytic performance of the PSII (O2) reaction.
BiVO4 powders were prepared following a previous report.28 A 5 mmol sample of Bi2O3 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd; 99.9%) and a 5 mmol sample of V2O5 (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.; 99.0%) were added to a 0.8 M HNO3 solution (50 mL). With stirring, the slurry was heated using a water bath at 20–80 °C for 48 h; the materials prepared in this manner are referred to as ‘BiVO4(X)’, where X refers to the preparation temperature. The resulting precipitate was washed with water, filtered, and dried overnight under vacuum at room temperature. The phase purity and crystallinity of the resulting powder were confirmed using X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical, EMPYREAN) and Raman spectroscopy (Jasco, NRS-1000), respectively. Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained using a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (JASCO, V-570) and were converted from reflectance into absorbance via the Kubelka–Munk method. The particle shapes and sizes were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, Ltd, S-4800). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface-area measurements via N2 adsorption–desorption at 77 K were performed using a BELSORP-miniII instrument (BEL Japan, Inc.). The samples were degassed under a N2 flow at 423 K for 60 min prior to data collection. The Fe(ClO4)3 hydration number was determined via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Rigaku, Thermo plus TG-8120). The amounts of adsorbed Fe(III) or Fe(II) were determined via colorimetry. The BiVO4 powder (100 mg) was dispersed in an aqueous solution (10 mL) of 2 mM Fe(ClO4)3 or Fe(ClO4)2 for 2 min using a magnetic stirrer, and then the amounts of adsorbed Fe(III) or Fe(II) were estimated using the differential spectrum between the iron salt solutions in the existence/absence of the photocatalyst powder. Before any spectroscopic measurement, Fe(II) or Fe(III) ions were coloured through complexation with 1,10-phenanthroline solutions at pH 4.4 or with chloride solutions in 6 M hydrochloric acid, respectively. Photocatalytic reactions were performed using a Pyrex side-window cell. A solar simulator (San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd, XES-151S, 9 cm2) was used as the light source and calibrated to AM1.5G (1 Sun, 100 mW cm−2) using a spectroradiometer (SOMA Optics, Ltd). The detailed evaluation procedure of photocatalytic performances is described in the ESI† (Table S1 and Fig. S1, S2).

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the BiVO4 powder prepared via the LSR method at various preparation temperatures. The split peak at around 35° in these patterns easily distinguishes the scheelite-monoclinic phase from the scheelite-tetragonal phase. The diffraction peaks in all patterns correspond to the scheelite-monoclinic phase (s-m phase), which is reported as being the favourable crystal structure for the water-oxidation reaction.26

Table 1 lists the photocatalytic properties of BiVO4, which reveal that the Fe(II) evolution rate improves significantly with increasing BiVO4-preparation temperature. BiVO4 prepared at 80 °C (BiVO4(80)) exhibited more than twice the activity of BiVO4(20). No clear correlations between the photocatalytic performance and absorption properties, particle shapes, sizes, and BET surface areas were observed (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†). In contrast, good correlations were observed between the photocatalytic performance and the full-width-at-half maxima (FWHMs) of the XRD and the Raman peaks; FWHMs of the singlet diffraction peak at 35.3° and the Raman bands at 205 and 825 cm−1 decreased in width with increasing preparation temperature (Fig. 2 and Fig. S5, ESI†). Consequently, these results indicated that the crystallinities of the prepared particles improved with increasing preparation temperature. Highly crystalline BiVO4 is favourable for the photocatalytic Fe(III)-reduction reaction.

Fig. 3 shows the dependences of pH and reaction-solution temperature on the amount of adsorbed Fe(III) and the photocatalytic performance over BiVO4(80). We found that the amounts of adsorbed Fe(III) increased both with increasing pH and temperature (Fig. 3(a)). We ensured that Fe(II) did not adsorb at all in the pH 2–2.8 range. It has been reported that during Fe(III) reduction with a TiO2 photocatalyst, Fe(III) must preferentially arrive at the photocatalyst surface and readily accept photo-generated electrons from the photocatalyst.29 Therefore, we expected BiVO4(80) to exhibit higher activity at higher pH values and temperatures. However, the reaction rates at 35 °C and 50 °C decreased with increasing pH, while that at 20 °C improved (Fig. 3(b)). The arrows indicate the optimum conditions at each reaction temperature. Fig. 3(c) displays the relationship between the activity and amount of adsorbed Fe(III); there appears to be an optimum range of adsorbed Fe(III) that provides the highest reaction rate. BiVO4 exhibited the highest activity at each reaction temperature when the amount of adsorbed Fe(III) was around 3–8 μmol g−1. Since 1 g of BiVO4(80) has a surface area of 1.0 m2 g−1, the surface coverage of BiVO4 with Fe(III) ions is simply determined to be 20–60% at the optimum adsorption amounts if we assume that the ionic radius of the Fe(III) complex ion is 2 Å. Hence, we propose that the activity is improved with increasing levels of adsorbed Fe(III) when the adsorption amount is less than ∼8 μmol g−1, while high levels of adsorption decrease the activity. This hypothesis is based on the importance of the ratio of surface sites for reduction to those for oxidation, and that surface sites for water oxidation to O2 might be covered by additionally adsorbed Fe(III). Consequently, the best performance (730 μmol h−1) was obtained at the optimized reactant-solution pH (2.5) and temperature (35 °C).

Light source: solar simulator (AM1.5G), irradiation area: 9 cm2. Measurement errors of the data of photocatalytic performances were less than 3%. 

Fig. 4 shows the action spectrum for Fe(III) reduction over BiVO4(80). The AQE at 420 nm was determined to be ∼38%. The AQE determined from the Fe(II)-production rate was the same as that determined from the rate of O2-production measured using gas chromatography, and is the best value among PSII (O2) reactions using reversible redox mediators over BiVO4 powder. The AQE at 365 nm was 24%. The Fe(III) solution strongly absorbs in the UV region (Fig. S6, ESI†); consequently, the AQE in the UV region was observed to be low due to the light-shielding effect of the Fe(III)-reaction solution.

Light source: a 300 W Xe lamp fitted with a band-pass filter. Reaction solution temperature: 35 °C. Measurement errors of all quantum efficiency data were less than 5%. 

Fig. 5 shows the time course of the Fe(III)-reduction reaction under visible light irradiation using a Xe lamp fitted with a UV cut-off filter. Blank reactions conducted in the absence of the photocatalyst or light did not result in any Fe(II) production. The photocatalytic reaction proceeded steadily on BiVO4 until the total quantity of Fe(II) produced reached 300 μmol, which matches the stoichiometric quantity expected since 300 μmol of Fe(III) was present in the reaction solution. Furthermore, we detected a stoichiometric quantity of O2 (75 μmol) using on-line gas chromatography, which confirms that Fe(II) and O2 were photocatalytically produced in a 4:1 ratio according to eqn (1). The O2-production rate was determined to reach 1100 μmol h−1. The activity of BiVO4 was much higher than that reported previously and determined under similar experimental conditions to those of the present study. The photocatalytic redox reaction involving water oxidation to give O2 and Fe(III) reduction to afford Fe(II) is the energy-storage reaction shown in eqn (1); the amount of stored energy increases with decreasing pH and Fe(III)/Fe(II) ratio although the pH change during the photocatalytic reaction is negligible. Therefore, low-pH conditions are favourable for achieving high solar-to-chemical energy-conversion efficiencies (ηsun). BiVO4 showed the highest ηsun (0.65%) at pH 2.3 and 50 °C. This is the best value among those of powdered photocatalysts suspended in reaction solutions containing reversible redox mediators. We also confirmed that the produced Fe(II) ion was not oxidized at all even when the oxygen was bubbled overnight in the Fe(II) solution at pH2.3.

Light source: a 300 W Xe lamp (λ > 420 nm), reaction solution temperature: 35 °C. The dashed line indicates the upper limit for Fe(II) generation. Measurement errors of the photocatalytic performances were less than 3%. 
In conclusion, BiVO4 prepared via the LSR method at 80 °C exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity. The improvement in the prepared-particle crystallinity is a key factor that contributed to the improved photocatalytic performance; the preparation-solution temperature strongly affected the crystallinity. The photocatalytic performance was strongly affected by the pH value and temperature of the reaction solution. The balance between reduction and oxidation needs to be considered for efficient photocatalysis. The amount of adsorbed Fe(III) on the BiVO4 particles was sensitive to the reaction temperature and pH. On the basis of the experimental results, we conclude that controlling the amount of adsorbed Fe(III) on the BiVO4 surface is important for realizing high performance. Consequently, we demonstrated that a high AQE (38% at 420 nm) and solar-to-chemical energy conversion (0.65%) could be achieved. In a primitive cell for the electrolysis–photocatalysis hybrid system, the electrolysis for H2 evolution under a small bias less than 1.23 V could be demonstrated using Fe(II) solution produced by the photocatalysis over BiVO4 (Fig. S7, ESI†). These findings open new avenues for designing highly efficient individual gas-production methods based on Z-scheme systems, assisted by redox mediators.
