Herein, we obtained bismuth-based catalysts consisting of oxidized Bi2O2CO3 and metallic Bi featuring local shortened inter-layer Bi–Bi bonds from in situ reduction of bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) microflowers, which showed over 90% formate faradaic efficiency in a wide negative potential region.
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to useful fuels and chemicals provides a promising way for capture and conversion of atmospheric CO2, especially combined with solar- or wind-powered electricity.1–8 Among the various products derived from the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), formate (HCOO−) plays an important role as a chemical feedstock and can be used directly in formate fuel cells.9–12 Although some high-selectivity electrocatalysts of heavy metals have been developed to stimulate formate formation in CO2RR, these catalytic materials are highly toxic and environmentally detrimental.1,13 Unfortunately, the developed electrocatalysts suffer from a low partial current density (or reaction rate), usually lower than 10 mA cm−2 at the peak-selectivity potential, and even worse, their optimum HCOO− faradaic efficiency (FE) cannot be maintained with the fluctuation of the wide operating potential range.14,15 Therefore, it still remains a big challenge to fabricate efficient and durable electrocatalysts with high FE over a wide negative potential range.
Over the past few years, tremendous efforts have been made to improve the selectivity and activity over CO2RR electrocatalysts, such as composition tuning,16 morphology engineering,17 lattice cutting,18 boundary construction19 and electronic structure modulation.20,21 Xie's group developed four-atom-thick-layered cobalt-based catalysts with the co-existence of cobalt and cobalt oxide, and the optimized two-dimensional structure and oxidation states could efficiently generate HCOO− at a low overpotential of −0.24 V.9 Sargent's group proposed a field-induced reagent concentration strategy over Pd nanoneedles, with an accelerated HCOO− formation rate due to the modulated CO2RR kinetics of the locally concentrated cations.22 Besides such strategies for transition metal-based electrocatalysts, which were mainly focused on modulating d-orbital electrons, He et al. successfully manipulated p-orbital electron densities over metallic bismuth (Bi) electrocatalysts, with an optimized intermediate *OCHO adsorption energy to boost CO2RR in the relatively high overpotential region.10 Recently, Zhang et al. developed a few-layered bismuth subcarbonate (Bi2O2CO3) electrocatalyst and demonstrated the significant importance of co-existence of metallic Bi and oxidized Bi2O2CO3 at suitable low reductive potentials.23 In this regard, we anticipate that low toxicity and environmentally friendly Bi-based CO2RR electrocatalysts can exhibit excellent activity and selectivity in the wide potential region upon co-modulating the surface oxidation states of oxidized species and p-orbital electrons of metallic Bi.
Herein, we fabricated main-group Bi-based electrocatalysts via in situ reduction of bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) microflowers under the CO2-saturated electrolyte, which could completely transform into oxidized Bi2O2CO3 and metallic Bi nanocomposites under cathodic conditions. The I-containing cathode electrocatalyst would be self-reconstructed at cathodic potentials.13,24 The resultant catalyst (named as P-BiOI) consists of the surface oxidized Bi2O2CO3 species and shortened Bi–Bi inter-layer bond lengths with delocalized p-electrons, consequently converting CO2 into HCOO− with high faradaic efficiencies over 90% in a broad potential region from −0.80 to −1.50 V (vs. RHE, the potentials hereafter were all referenced to RHE if not mentioned). Compared with commercial Bi powders and Bi2O2CO3 controls with lower formate formation activity and selectivity, we highlight the importance of co-modulating the oxidation states and local bond lengths for main-group metal-based CO2RR electrocatalysts.
BiOI microflowers were firstly synthesized by a hydrothermal method (more details were provided in the ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1a, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared samples were well indexed to the tetragonal BiOI (PDF #10-0445). After in situ reduction in 0.5 M KHCO3 CO2-saturated electrolyte for about 1 h (at a bias of −1.00 V), the BiOI precursor has been phase-changed into rhombohedral Bi (PDF #85-1331) and tetragonal Bi2O2CO3 (PDF #41-1488), with no detectable pristine BiOI phase (Fig. 1b). It should be noted that Bi2O2CO3 features a layered structure consisting of [Bi2O2]2+ and CO32− with an interlayer distance of 0.684 nm, which is similar to layered BiOI except for interlayer anions.23 Considering the strong peak intensities of Bi2O2CO3, we speculated that the crystalline Bi2O2CO3 species were stable and easily obtained under cathodic potential with interlayer ions exchanged from BiOI. In the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images, pristine BiOI exhibited a microflower morphology with a particle size of about 1.5 μm (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1, ESI†). The transmission electron microscopic (TEM) image also confirmed that the hierarchical morphology was assembled with nanosheets (Fig. 1d). After the cathodic reaction, the microflower morphology was destroyed with stacked nanosheets and particles (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†). In the TEM image of the BiOI sample after reaction, nanoparticles along with nanosheet morphology were also observed (Fig. 1e). In the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image, two sets of lattice fringes were observed, with 0.295 nm corresponding to the tetragonal Bi2O2CO3 (013) planes and 0.326 nm corresponding to the rhombohedral Bi (012) planes, respectively. These results indicated that the pristine BiOI microflowers could undergo reduction to generate layered oxidized Bi2O2CO3 and metallic Bi components.

We also synthesised pure Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets for comparison (Fig. S4, ESI†). Cyclic voltammetric measurements were conducted to reveal the phase transformation between oxyiodide, subcarbonate and metallic Bi in the reaction solution. In Fig. S5 (ESI†), the negative scan revealed that the broad reduction peaks with a potential region more negative than about 0.10 V were attributed to the reduction of oxidized Bi to Bi metal. In the reverse positive scan, obvious oxidation peaks were clearly observed for both BiOI and Bi2O2CO3. It should be noted that the areas associated with the reduction process were significantly lower than those of the oxidation of metallic Bi, indicating that the reduction process was incomplete, which further demonstrated the existence of partially oxidized Bi species.23 After CV measurements (3 cycles), both samples of BiOI and Bi2O2CO3 retained the crystalline phase of tetragonal Bi2O2CO3 (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†). We also collected BiOI samples biased at different cathodic potentials for XRD analysis, indicating that the higher negative potential would generate more components of crystalline metallic Bi (Fig. S8, ESI†).
To analyse the chemical valence state changes of surface elements, we collected BiOI samples before and after cathodic polarization biased at −1.00 V for 1 h for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization. In Fig. 2a, the XPS spectra of the Bi 4f region exhibited two obvious peaks centered at 165.3 and 160.0 eV, which correspond to Bi3+ species.10,25 After the reduction process, two predominant peaks at 164.2 and 158.9 eV ascribed to metallic Bi0 were detected, which underwent a shift of about 1.1 eV to lower binding energies. In addition, no detectable signals of iodine species were observed after the cathodic additions (Fig. 2b), suggesting that the pristine BiOI was completely converted and no obvious adsorbed I− ions were characterized in our catalytic systems.

To further monitor the electronic structures of BiOI samples during the CO2RR process, we carried out the operando X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopic characterization. In Fig. 3a, the pristine BiOI exhibited nearly the same bulk valence states as the Bi2O2CO3 controls, indicating the oxidized Bi3+ species in the [Bi2O2]2+ units. Under operating biases of −0.90 and −1.10 V for about 15 min, the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of the Bi L3 edge for BiOI exhibited a continuous reduction in the oxidation states. It should be noted that the bulk valence states of Bi in BiOI samples have been reduced to Bi0 under CO2RR conditions, and displayed overlapped curves like controlled metallic commercial Bi powders. We also resolved the Fourier transform |χ(R)| spectrum to study the local coordination structures of BiOI under different reaction conditions as a function of radical distance (Fig. 3b). Different distributions of Bi–O/I and Bi–O/C located at 1.72 and 1.61 Å (without phase correction) were evident of the characteristic BiOI and Bi2O2CO3 samples, respectively. After reduction reactions, BiOI samples exhibited the shortened bond length for Bi–X (X stands for the non-metallic elements) neighbours than the pristine Bi–O/I bonds, which suggested the existence of partially oxidized Bi–O/C bonds like Bi2O2CO3 controls. Meanwhile, the reduced BiOI samples displayed a shorter Bi–Bi inter-layer bond length (3.06 Å) than those (3.11 Å) of the compared metallic Bi controls. These results also demonstrated the co-existence of partially oxidized Bi species and metallic Bi with shorter inter-layer bond distances. In comparison, the Bi2O2CO3 controls after the reaction were also collected for characterization, which exhibited bulk Bi0 valence states and nearly unchanged Bi–Bi intra- and inter-layer bond lengths due to the metallic commercial Bi powders (Fig. S9, ESI†). Moreover, the XRD pattern of P-BiOI also demonstrated that the diffraction peaks of metallic Bi shifted to higher angles compared with commercial Bi powders (Fig. S10, ESI†), suggesting the characteristic shortened inter-layer Bi–Bi bonds.

We then sought to investigate the CO2RR performances of reduced BiOI derived electrocatalysts and controls in gas-tight two-compartment electrochemical cells (see more details in the ESI†). Linear-sweep voltammetry (LSV) of different samples decorated with electrodes were conducted in 0.5 M Ar- and CO2-saturated KHCO3 electrolytes, respectively. In Fig. 4a, the LSV curves of BiOI and Bi2O2CO3 after reduction (named as P-BiOI and P-Bi2O2CO3) and commercial Bi powders all showed a larger current density in a CO2-saturated solution than in an Ar-saturated solution, which indicated the CO2 reduction activity of all the Bi-based samples. At the same time, P-BiOI showed the largest catalytic activity among the controls, as indicated by the onset potential and current density.

(b) Potential dependence of faradaic efficiencies for H2, CO and HCOO− on P-BiOI samples in comparison with faradaic efficiencies for HCOO− on P-Bi2O2CO3 and commercial Bi powders as controls.

(d) Stability test at −1.00 V on P-BiOI samples and the recorded time-dependent current densities and HCOO− faradaic efficiencies. 
To identify and quantify the resulting products, cathodic electrocatalysis was carried out from −0.80 to −1.50 V for 4000 seconds, using gas chromatography (GC) to periodically analyse the gas products and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to quantify the liquid products. As shown in Fig. 4b, the P-BiOI samples exhibited excellent selectivities to HCOO−, which were higher than 90% faradaic efficiencies from −0.80 to −1.50 V, with the largest faradaic efficiencies approaching nearly 100% at −1.20 and −1.30 V. It should be noted that the P-BiOI samples demonstrated an average faradaic efficiency of about 96.2% from −0.80 to −1.50 V. We also found that the accompanying H2 and CO gas products accounted for small concentrations, which were both lower than 5% from −0.80 to −1.40 V. In comparison, the P-Bi2O2CO3 and Bi powders exhibited satisfactory formate selectivity, but generally lower than P-BiOI, proving the outstanding CO2RR activity for P-BiOI samples. In the meanwhile, we also obtained different HCOO− selectivities and total catalytic current densities at different operating potentials (Fig. S11 and S12, ESI†). To eliminate the influence of dissolved I− anions, P-BiOI rinsed with DI water was evaluated in a fresh electrolyte, which showed no obvious changes compared with that in the pristine electrolyte (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†).
The potential-dependent partial HCOO− current density curves are shown in Fig. 4c, and the P-BiOI sample exhibited larger catalytic current densities toward HCOO− (jHCOO−) than P-Bi2O2CO3 and commercial Bi catalysts, which reached about −81 mA cm−2 at −1.50 V, whereas the P-Bi2O2CO3 sample showed a jHCOO− of about −62 mA cm−2 and the Bi powders exhibited a jHCOO− of about −35 mA cm−2. Due to the large catalytic current density along with high faradaic efficiency toward formate the P-BiOI sample behaved as an excellent CO2RR electrocatalyst, which might be attributed to the oxidized Bi species in the low overpotential region and main metallic Bi characterized with shortened Bi–Bi inter-layer bonds under high operating overpotentials.10,23 Tafel plots were recorded to investigate the reaction kinetics of CO2 reduction. In Fig. S15 (ESI†), in the range of relatively lower current densities, the slope values of P-BiOI, P-Bi2O2CO3 and Bi are 152, 201 and 235 mV dec−1, indicating the optimized kinetic activity of the P-BiOI electrocatalyst compared with the controls. The Tafel slope value of P-BiOI is close to the theoretical value of 118 mV dec−1, suggesting that the chemical rate-determining step is the first electron transfer step in which the adsorbed short-lived CO2*− intermediate was formed.10,14
To further analyse the stability of the P-BiOI electrocatalyst, we performed bulk electrocatalysis at a constant potential of −1.00 V. As shown in Fig. 4d, the P-BiOI sample delivered a catalytic current density of around −40 mA cm−2 for continuous 7 hours. The catalytic current density exhibited an increasing trend possibly because of more generated metallic Bi species at the relatively high cathodic potentials. We collected the liquid electrolyte of about 1 mL for NMR analysis and re-injected an equivalent fresh electrolyte of CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 every 2 hours. It is interesting that the faradaic efficiency remained over 90% for continuous CO2RR operation, without obvious activity loss. The 7 hour's durability test here was far from approaching the possible end of the catalyst life. These results showed that P-BiOI electrocatalysts exhibited excellent stability of activity and selectivity.
In summary, the BiOI microflower derived electrocatalysts exhibited an excellent intrinsic CO2RR activity towards formate products, demonstrating an average faradaic efficiency of 96.2% over a wide potential region from −0.80 to −1.50 V with large catalytic current densities and durable stability. In addition, the experimental results reveal that the maintenance of high CO2RR activity over the wide potential regions is attributed to the partially oxidized Bi species with shortened inter-layer Bi–Bi bonds, which can effectively tune the electron densities of localized p-orbitals for optimized intermediate adsorption energies. This work may provide a new avenue for co-modulating the surface valence states and bulk metallic bond lengths for developing efficient main-group metal-based CO2RR electrocatalysts.
