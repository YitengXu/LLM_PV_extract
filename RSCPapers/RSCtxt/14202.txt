    , Accepted 7th February 2012First published on 27th February 2012AbstractWhile adding extra Mg is intended to compensate for the Mg loss during the synthesis, it often leads to Mg interstitials in Mg2(Si,Sn) materials and profoundly affects their thermoelectric properties. Herein we studied the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity of Mg2(1 + x)Si0.38Sn0.6Sb0.02 (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.12) as a function of Mg excess between 300 K and 730 K. The presence of interstitial Mg was corroborated by X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Hall coefficient measurement, and compositional analysis. The electrical properties have been analyzed in the framework of a single parabolic band model to gain more insight on the roles of Mg interstitials. We found that increasing Mg excess content increased the carrier concentration, electronic effective mass, and electrical conductivity, while it decreased the Seebeck coefficient and led to a non-monotonic change in the lattice thermal conductivity. As a result, a maximum ZT ∼ 0.85 was attained at 700 K for Mg excess x = 0.1, a ∼60% enhancement compared to that of the sample x = 0.05. The Mg interstitials thus provide an extra tuning parameter in optimizing the thermoelectric properties of Mg2(Si,Sn)-based materials.
Introduction
Thermoelectric (TE) devices are prepared by solid-state assembly, quiet, and maintenance-free, and can directly convert heat into electricity from different sources such as solar heat, geothermal heat, and the exhaust of automobiles.1,2 The conversion efficiency of a TE device largely depends on the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, of the materials of which the device is made. ZT = α2σT/κ, where α is the Seebeck coefficient, σ the electrical conductivity, κ the thermal conductivity and T the temperature in Kelvin. In this vein, the study of thermoelectrics is materials oriented. While Bi2Te33 and PbTe based alloys4 remain the corner stone of state-of-the-art TE materials that have ZT ∼ 1, Mg2(Si,Sn)-based TE materials are receiving ever increasing attention because of their promising properties and the non-toxic and naturally abundant constituent elements.5–7
To date, one major challenge in developing high performance Mg2(Si,Sn)-based TE materials lies in the sample synthesis. The high vapor pressure and high reactivity of Mg often lead to Mg loss, oxidization, contamination, and thus poor reproducibility of the composition, microstructure, and TE properties of the samples. For example, the samples prepared by melting are often accompanied by oxides and Mg deficiency.8,9 A typical routine approach is to add a few percent of extra Mg in the starting materials to compensate for the Mg loss. But the compensation can hardly be precise: a small deviation from the stoichiometry may cause a dramatic change in the TE properties. For example, the room temperature electrical conductivity of nominally undoped Mg2Si (1.4 × 103 S m−1, 2% extra Mg added)10 is one order of magnitude smaller than that in another report (6.0 × 104 S m−1).11
In general, the samples prepared with extra Mg tend to form Mg interstitials. Kato et al. theoretically predicted that the n-type conduction in undoped binary Mg2Si originates from the interstitial Mg cations.12 In Mg2Si, donor-like defects could be antisite defects, Mg interstitials, and Si vacancies, in which antisites and Si vacancies have high formation energy while Mg interstitials are energetically favored. When ionized, each Mg donates two electrons to the conduction band. The Mg interstitials take place not only in the undoped binary Mg2Si but also in the Sb-doped ternary Mg2(Si,Sn) samples.7,13,14 There are several evidences for this. First, there is a strong correlation between the Mg excess content and the measured carrier concentration: the carrier concentrations are 3.9 × 1020 cm−3 and 2.5 × 1020 cm−3 in 1.5 mol% Sb-doped Mg2Si0.5Sn0.5 with a nominal Mg excess of 10 mol%13 and 5 mol%,14 respectively. Second, the calculated carrier concentrations are systematically smaller than the measured ones if not taking into account the Mg interstitials as donors.7,13,14 To our best knowledge, however, there is no systematic report yet on the effect of Mg excess on the TE properties of Mg2(Si,Sn) based materials. This is, to a large extent, due to the lack of a viable synthesis procedure that can effectively control the Mg content.
To this end, Zhu et al. have recently developed a B2O3 flux method that was proven effective in suppressing the Mg loss and oxidation of Mg.13 The method has been successfully employed to prepare Sb-doped Mg2Si1−xSnx compounds with reproducible high ZT values,13 and to investigate the composition range of the miscibility gap in the Mg2Si-Mg2Sn pseudo-binary system.15 More importantly, this method allows for extending our thermoelectrics study of Mg2(Si,Sn) materials into the regime of controllable Mg excess. An interesting question to be answered is whether the Mg interstitials are thermoelectrically favorable, and if so, in what range. In the present work, we intend to employ the flux method to synthesize samples with systematically varied compositions of Mg2(1 + x)Si0.38Sn0.6Sb0.02 (x = 0.05, 0.08, 0.10, 0.12) and study the resulting changes in composition, micro-structures, and TE properties.
Experimental
Mg2(1 + x)Si0.38Sn0.6Sb0.02 (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.12) compounds were synthesized by a B2O3 flux method.13 Stoichiometric amounts of elemental Mg (99%), Si (99.9%), Sn (99.5%), and Sb (99.999%) powders were weighed, thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar, transferred into an alumina crucible and covered by B2O3 powders in a glove box. The admixture was heated at 973 K for 10 h in a box furnace, before slowly cooling down to room temperature. The B2O3 flux and the Mg2(1 + x)Si0.38Sn0.6Sb0.02 compounds can be mechanically separated at this stage. The as-obtained Mg2(1 + x)Si0.38Sn0.6Sb0.02 samples were porous with lots of cracks, thus the next stage was to grind and densify the powers before a hot-pressing process. The typical hot pressing process was under a pressure of 80 MPa at 1050 K for 2 h.
The phase purity was checked by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku® D/MAX-2550PC diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation. The chemical compositions were characterized by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA, JEOL® JXA-8100) with a wavelength dispersive spectrometer (WDS). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained with an ESCALab220i-XL electron spectrometer (VG Scientific) using 300 W Al Kα radiation. The base pressure was about 3 × 10−9 mbar. The binding energies were referenced to the C 1s line at 284.6 eV from adventitious carbon. The electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient were measured on a computer-aided apparatus using a dc four-probe method and differential voltage/temperature technique, respectively.16 The uncertainty for the electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient measurements is about ±5%. The thermal diffusivity and specific heat were measured on a laser flash apparatus (Netzsch® LFA 457), with an uncertainty of about 3% and 5%, respectively. The thermal conductivity κ was calculated from the relationship κ = ρdaCp, where a is the thermal diffusivity, Cp the heat capacity per unit volume, and ρd the density of the sample. The Hall coefficient, RH, was measured at 300 K on a Quantum Design PPMS-9T using a four-probe configuration, with the magnetic field sweeping between ±4.0 T. The carrier concentration was calculated using the relation n = −(1/eRH).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) presents the XRD patterns of Mg2(1 + x)Si0.38Sn0.6Sb0.02 (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.12) samples. All major diffraction peaks can be indexed to an anti-fluorite-type structure (space group, Fm-3m), with the peaks located between the major peaks of pure Mg2Si (JCPDS #35-0773) and those of pure Mg2Sn (JCPDS #07-0274), indicating the formation of solid solutions. The lattice constant stays nearly the same (Fig. 1(b)). This observation is understandable in that each unit cell has only one available site for the Mg interstitial (Fig. 1(c)), and the presence of the Mg interstitial is expected to have little effect on the size of the unit cell, provided that the ionic radius of Mg2+ is only about 0.60 Å.12,17 Nonetheless, the presence of Mg interstitials leads to a lattice disorder, which is reflected in the systematic increase of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (111) peak with increasing Mg excess (Fig. 1(d)).

Trace MgO is indicated by the circle symbol in (a). 
Furthermore, XPS measurements allow us to probe the different chemical shift of the Mg interstitial and the lattice Mg. Fig. 2 shows the Mg 2p XPS high resolution spectra of the Mg2.24Si0.38Sn0.6Sb0.02 and Mg2.2Si0.38Sn0.6Sb0.02 samples. The Mg 2p peak is decomposed into two components at binding energies of ∼49.0 and 50.0 eV, which can be attributed to the interstitial Mg and the lattice Mg, respectively. The ratio of interstitial magnesium peak area to overall area for x = 0.12 is ∼3% higher than that of the sample with x = 0.1, consistent with an increasing amount of Mg interstitials.

The EMPA results (Table 1) clearly show that the actual Mg content is proportional to the Mg excess in the starting materials, while the Si:Sn:Sb ratio is very close to the stoichiometry. Importantly, all samples show Mg excess, suggesting the presence of Mg interstitials. Concerning the solubility of Mg, Nolas et al. reported a 3 mol% excess Mg in Sb-doped Mg2Si,10 while we herein found an as much as 6.4 mol% excess Mg can be accommodated in the Sb-doped Mg2Si0.4Sn0.6 compounds.

Fig. 3(a) presents the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity, σ, of Mg2(1 + x)Si0.38Sn0.6Sb0.02 samples. The σ of all samples decreases with increasing temperature, a typical behavior of a degenerated semiconductor.18 Note that for the sample x = 0.05, the σ starts increasing above 530 K with increasing temperature, a sign of the onset of intrinsic excitation. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the excess Mg results in a non-linear increase of the carrier concentration, n. The room temperature n and σ of the sample x = 0.12 attains 19.3 × 1020 cm−3 and 23.0 × 104 S m−1, one order of magnitude higher than 1.3 × 1020 cm−3 and 1.5 × 104 S m−1 of the sample x = 0.05, respectively.
 Fig. 3  (a) Temperature dependence of electrical conductivity σ, (b) the measured carrier concentration as a function of the nominal Mg excess content, along with the predicted concentration assuming one Sb donates one electron, and (c) the measured carrier concentration by Liu,7 Gao13 and Isoda14 along with the predicted line. The green solid curve in (c) is a guide to the eyes. The detailed discussion is given in the main text. 
To clarify the role of Mg interstitials in the increment of n, we first estimate the contribution of Sb. In Mg2(1 + x)Si0.38Sn0.6Sb0.02 compounds, Sb is a known donor. If each Sb donates one electron, and provided the Sb content is determined by EMPA (Table 1), the maximal n value is expected to be ∼3.18 × 1020 cm−3. As a comparison, we present the n values vs. the Sb content reported in the literature in Fig. 3(c). Apparently, the Sb donors cannot solely account for the observed n values, without taking into account the contribution from other donors. Moreover, one has to take into consideration that a portion of Sb may become inactive in donating electrons at high doping ratios, like the case of Bi dopant in Mg2Si above 2%.19 Gao et al.13 and Liu et al.7 reported n ∼ 2.6 × 1020 cm−3 and ∼2.4 × 1020 cm−3 in the Mg2Si0.487Sn0.5Sb0.013 and Mg2Si0.5875Sn0.4Sb0.0125 samples with Mg excess, respectively, while Sb can at most contribute ∼1.6 × 1020 cm−3. All these observations point to the significance of Mg interstitials as donors in Mg2(Si,Sn) based compounds.6,7,13,14,20
Also apparent in Fig. 3(b) is that the discrepancy between the observed n values and the predicted n values solely from Sb doping gets larger with increasing Mg excess. In view of the fact that one Mg interstitial can donate two electrons to the conduction band,12 it strongly suggests that the contribution from Mg interstitials dominates the carrier concentration, at least, the variance of the observed n values is mostly due to the increasing Mg interstitials. In addition, the data shown in Fig. 3(c) and Table 1 suggest that the Sb doping seems to increase the solubility of Mg. This important observation allows for a larger control parameter space for further optimization of this class of TE materials.
As shown in Fig. 4(a), the Seebeck coefficient values are negative in the temperature range studied for all samples, indicative of an n-type conduction. The absolute α first increases with temperature, and drops fast above 560 K and 620 K due to the bipolar conduction for the samples x = 0.05 and 0.08, respectively. The bipolar effect is shifted to higher temperatures for x = 0.1 and 0.12. The Seebeck coefficient is sensitive to the electronic band structure and carrier concentration. In this vein, the systematic changes of Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity with the increase of Mg excess indicate the Mg excess does affect the electronic band structures and carrier concentration. In other words, the Mg interstitials provide a new tuning knob to optimize the band structure of Mg2(Si,Sn) based TE materials.

Next we apply a simple parabolic band model to shed more light on how the Mg interstitials affect the various aspects of the band structure. We are fully aware that the actual band structure is complicated, the following discussion is semi-quantitative but nonetheless instructive. Assuming a single parabolic band, α and n are given by21 (1) (2) (3) ηF = EF/(kBT)(4)where Fi(ηi) is the Fermi–Dirac integral, ηF the reduced Fermi level, kB the Boltzmann constant, h the Planck constant. Fig. 4(b) plots the estimated effective mass, m*/m0, values using r = −1/2 for an acoustic phonon scattering mechanism,20,22–26 and the reduced Fermi level as a function of the Mg excess in the inset. It is plausible to assume a dominant electron–phonon coupling because the temperature dependence of σ is strong (Fig. 3(a)). In this picture, the Mg interstitials introduce extra carriers and so lift the Fermi level (the inset of Fig. 4(b)). As a verification, the calculated m* for x = 0.08 is in good agreement with that of Sb-doped Mg2Si0.4Sn0.6 (2.7 m0 at 2.3 × 1020 cm−3) reported by Zaitsev et al.5 The m* increases with increasing Mg content, indicating that the band structure is effectively altered by the Mg interstitials. As a result of the significantly increased n dominating the decrease of the absolute α, a marked enhancement in power factor (∼3.1 W m−1 K−2 at 600 K) is obtained for x = 0.1, which is more than two times of that of x = 0.05 (Fig. 4(c)).

Fig. 5(a) presents the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity, κ, of Mg2(1 + x)Si0.38Sn0.6Sb0.02. The κ increases with increasing Mg content due to the enhanced electrical conductivity. The lattice thermal conductivity, κL, values were estimated by subtracting the carrier thermal conductivity, κe, from κ using the Wiedemann–Franz relation, κe = L0σT. The Lorenz number, L0, on the basis of Fermi–Dirac statistics is expressed as follows: (5) (6)
 Fig. 5  Temperature dependences of thermal conductivity κ (a), calculated L0 (b) and lattice contribution κL (c), κL ∼ 1/T relationships (d), and the plot of κLT vs. x (e) for Mg2(1 + x)Si0.38Sn0.6Sb0.02 samples, the inset of (e) shows the Mg excess dependence of the sample packing density. 
The reduced Fermi energy ηF was calculated from formula (1). The calculated Lorenz number L0 was plotted in Fig. 5(b). It is in the range of 2.0 × 10−8 V2 K−2 to 1.7 × 10−8 V2 K−2 in the temperature of 300 K–720 K, which is substantially less than 2.44 × 10−8 V2 K−2 for a metal27 but in accordance with a degenerate semiconductor. The L0 value decreases with increasing temperature due to the decrease of the reduced Fermi energy ηF.
The temperature dependence of the κL value is plotted in Fig. 5(c). The upturns at high temperatures (T > 650 K) are due to an onset of bipolar conduction as the contribution from minority holes increases upon samples approaching the intrinsic excitation regime. The Mg interstitials tend to shift the onset of intrinsic conduction (and the detrimental bipolar conduction) to higher temperatures, which helps it maintain a low κ value over a wider range of temperature. And, as we shall show shortly, this will lead to a shift in the temperature where the ZT peaks. As shown in Fig. 5(d), the κL is consistent with a T−1 relationship before intrinsic excitation, as expected from an Umklapp phonon-phonon scattering mechanism.13,25 It should be noted that the κL first increases and then decreases with increasing Mg content. This may be explained in the light of the Keyes relation.28 (7) (8)where R is the gas constant, NA is Avogadro's number, γ is the Grüneisen parameter. εm is the ratio of the atomic vibrations to the lattice constant when a solid melts. Since the two parameters γ and εm do not vary much from one material to another, BK involves only universal constants. At a fixed temperature, the lattice thermal conductivity is proportional to the melting temperature Tm and density ρd, while in inverse proportion to the mean atomic weight A. So the trend of the κL can be, at least, partially due to the change of packing densities related to the interstitial magnesium. To verify this argument, we plot the calculated BKTm3/2ρd2/3/A7/6 values in Fig. 5(e). The value increases from 0.33 × 10−3 W m−1 (x = 0.05) to 0.36 × 10−3 W m−1 (x = 0.01) and then drops to 0.32 × 10−3 W m−1 (x = 0.12), in conjunction with the change of the density behavior (the inset of Fig. 5(e)).
With σ, α, κ known, the temperature dependence of ZT for Mg2(1 + x)Si0.38Sn0.6Sb0.02 (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.12) was calculated and presented in Fig. 6. The maximum ZT value of 0.85 was obtained at 700 K for x = 0.1, which is enhanced by 63% as compared to the sample with x = 0.05. This is, to a large extent, due to the enhanced n and σ by the Mg interstitials.

Conclusions
The electrical conductivity, Hall coefficient, Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity of Mg2(1 + x)Si0.38Sn0.6Sb0.02 (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.12) compounds are reported. It is found that the carrier concentration and electrical conductivity were significantly enhanced by the Mg interstitials, while the degradation of the Seebeck coefficient was acceptable. As a result, we have a marked enhancement in the power factor for x = 0.1 (3.1 W m−1 K−2 at 600 K), which is more than two times that of x = 0.05. With the help of a single parabolic band model, we find that both the carrier concentration and electron effective mass increase with increasing Mg content. The lattice thermal conductivity shows a T−1 dependence, indicative of the “Umklapp process”. The magnitude of lattice thermal conductivity first increases and then decreases with the increase of Mg content. The maximum ZT value of ∼0.85 is obtained at 700 K for x = 0.1, a 63% enhancement as compared to the sample x = 0.05. Since the Mg interstitials predominate over Sb in the carrier concentration, the results emanating from this work corroborate the crucial importance of controlling the Mg stoichiometry in the Mg2(Si,Sn) based materials to obtain high TE performance. Meanwhile, the Mg interstitials also provide an extra tuning knob to help realize higher TE performance in these materials.
