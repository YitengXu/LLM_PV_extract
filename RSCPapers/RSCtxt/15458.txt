    , Accepted 3rd April 2020First published on 6th April 2020AbstractThe thermoelectric (TE) effect in nanoscale materials is of great interest as an ideal platform for small-scale energy harvesting and micro-cooling technologies. In this regard, two-dimensional (2D) metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) can be considered as a promising material for TE applications owing to their superior electronic and phonon transport properties provided by a favorable large energy band gap and an atomically thin layer, which serves as an ideal quantum well structure. We investigate and conduct a direct comparison of the cross-plane Seebeck coefficients of various TMDC films prepared by using the chemical vapor deposition method. In particular, these coefficients for MoS2, WSe2, and WS2 thin films are determined to be approximately 115, 129, and 211 μV K−1 at 300 K, respectively. The chemically formed holey structure of MoS2 thin films with a thickness of ∼7 nm exhibits superior in-plane Seebeck coefficients of ∼742 μV K−1, showing strong anisotropic behavior with a ratio of ∼6.5 along in- and cross-plane directions at 300 K. Such behavior can be explained by the energy filtering effect in the holey MoS2 film in the in-plane direction. Moreover, an extremely high anisotropic ratio (∼2.4 × 108) of the power factor was observed owing to the large in-plane Seebeck coefficients and the electrical conductivity of the MoS2 films across the samples. This study is the first to assess the cross-plane Seebeck coefficients of large-scale MoS2, WS2, and WSe2 thin films at 300 K and analyze the anisotropic behavior of the MoS2 film. The results reported here confirm the importance of providing reliable Seebeck coefficient information on films formed by using TMDC materials for further application on TE devices.
1. Introduction
Thermoelectric (TE) energy conversion is an important technology for energy-harvesting device applications, which converts waste heat into electrical power and vice versa.1–6 The efficiency of TE materials is generally characterized by a dimensionless figure of merit quantity, ZT = S2σT/κ, where σ is the electrical conductivity, S is the Seebeck coefficient, T is the absolute temperature, and κ is the thermal conductivity.4,7–11 In particular, the Seebeck coefficient is a significant factor in the design of high ZT TE materials. Low-dimensional materials and structures, such as two-dimensional (2D)12–14 or one-dimensional/zero-dimensional (1D/0D) structures4,15–17 have promising advantages for increasing the ZT value because S is strongly related to the profile of the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy level. For instance, HgTe quantum dots,16 SiGe nanowires,17 Te nanosheets,13 and Bi2Te3/Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 superlattice thin films14 were recently fabricated to enhance their TE properties.
Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials have an MX2 stoichiometry where M and X are a transition metal and chalcogen, respectively. In the past decade, low-dimensional TMDC materials have attracted the attention of researchers due to their interesting optical and electronic properties.18–21 For example, porous MoS2 and MoSe2 nanosheets19–21 were used as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction and NbSe2 nanosheets, nanorods, and nanoparticles were used as counter electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells.18 In the case of TE energy conversion, recently emerging 2D TMDC materials such as MoS2, WS2, and WSe2 are ideal platforms for TE energy generation applications because they naturally formed 2D-layered materials with an atomic thickness of <1 nm. These materials also provide superior electronic and phonon transport properties, which significantly leads to high TE ZT values. Several research groups have recently reported remarkably high TE Seebeck coefficients (i.e., thermopower) of single layers of MoS2 and WSe2 produced by mechanical exfoliation22,23 and chemical vapor deposition (CVD).24,25 For example, Wu et al. investigated electrically modulated TE Seebeck coefficients of CVD-grown single layer MoS2 and obtained superior Seebeck coefficients of up to ∼3 × 104 μV K−1 at room temperature.25 Similarly, Buscema et al. reported remarkable Seebeck coefficients of ∼1 × 104 μV K−1 for mechanically exfoliated single-layer MoS2 flakes produced by laser heating.23
Previous relevant studies have focused on Seebeck coefficients of mechanically exfoliated and CVD-grown 2D TMDC layers only in the in-plane direction (i.e., parallel to the sample surface). To the best of our knowledge, no experimental results have been reported regarding the TE properties of films formed by 2D TMDC materials in the cross-plane direction (i.e., perpendicular to the sample surface). Moreover, although recent studies investigated the in-plane electrical and Seebeck TE power of 2D MoS2 layers, an extensive and systematic study of the anisotropic properties of films formed by large-area MoS2 films has not been conducted.
Here, we investigate the cross-plane TE properties of CVD-prepared large-area MoS2, WSe2, and WS2 films by measuring the Seebeck coefficients of the samples. In addition, the Seebeck coefficients of the MoS2 films with chemically formed holey structures are measured along the two directions, i.e., perpendicular (cross-plane) and parallel (in-plane) to the sample surfaces, to evaluate the anisotropic properties in a vacuum chamber at temperature differences of 1 to 10 K. Our study incorporates several distinct features compared with previous studies of the TE transport of TMDC bulk and single-crystal materials. First, this study is the first to assess the cross-plane Seebeck coefficients of CVD-prepared large-scale MoS2, WS2, and WSe2 thin films at 300 K. Second, our approach for evaluating the Seebeck properties of films formed by TMDC materials yields reliable measurements and is well suited for future device applications because the typical size of single crystal samples is less than 10 μm2. Third, the anisotropic Seebeck coefficients and power factors of the MoS2 films is an entirely new study. Fourth, the chemically formed holey MoS2 thin films show extremely high in-plane Seebeck coefficients at 300 K. Fifth, the proposed methodology for evaluating the TE properties of TMDC films will be extremely useful for understanding additional electronic and phononic properties in future studies.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Sample growth of large-area MoS2, WS2, and WSe2 films
Thin films of MoO3 and WO3 with 99.9% purity (iTASCO) at various thicknesses of 5, 10, and 15 nm were deposited by using an e-beam evaporator (Korea Vacuum Tech Co, Ltd). For the synthesis of the MoS2, WS2, and WSe2 thin films, we followed a simple sulfurization/selenization procedure with H2 and N2 gases used for the sulfurization/selenization process in a low-pressure CVD system. First, the CVD furnace temperature was raised to 900 °C (sulfurization)/800 °C (selenization) and was maintained for 40 min under the flow of H2 and N2 at 0.8 Torr. The flow rates of H2 and N2 were fixed to 100 and 500 cm3 min−1, respectively. Then, sublimation of S (99.998%, Sigma-Aldrich)/Se power (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) was initiated in the other heating zone upstream at a temperature of 200 °C/300 °C. This process was repeated for 30 min to obtain successful substitution of O2 to S/Se in the precursor thin films. For the surface morphology and roughness of the samples, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurement were performed. Furthermore, the topological characteristics, crystal structures, and elemental distributions in holey MoS2 films were investigated by Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with scanning TEM (STEM) analysis.
2.2 In- and cross-plane Seebeck coefficient measurements of 2D TMDC films

Fig. 1a shows a schematic of the Seebeck coefficient measurements in 2D-layered MoS2 films in the perpendicular direction to the sample surface. As shown in the figure, the CVD-grown MoS2 films were first wet-transferred onto the Cu/SiO2/Si substrate by sputtering, and then the top ∼200 nm of the Cu metal was sputtered onto MoS2/Cu/SiO2/Si at 300 K (further details of the wet-transfer process are given in the ESI†). The sandwiched structures of Cu/MoS2/Cu and SiO2/Si were finally created to evaluate the cross-plane Seebeck coefficient; details of the experimental setup can be found in previous research.26 Briefly, as shown in Fig. 1a, the samples were held between an AlN layer, which was used as a heat bath, and a micro-Peltier module, which was used as a heating source. The upper plate was attached to the heat bath, and the lower plate was placed on the top of the micro-Peltier module, which was thermally connected to the heat bath through a Mo screw (Fig. 1a). By applying an electric current to the micro-Peltier module, a temperature gradient (∇T) was generated across the Cu/MoS2/Cu samples. This temperature difference (ΔT) was measured by using two T-type thermocouples in which the cross-plane TE Seebeck voltages (ΔV) were measured by two shielded W needles between the upper and lower Cu plates (Fig. 1a). Accordingly, the cross-plane Seebeck coefficients of 2D MoS2 films at a given temperature were calculated by linearly fitting ΔV versus ΔT using S = −ΔV/ΔT. All Seebeck coefficients of only MoS2 films (SMoS2) were evaluated by subtracting the Seebeck coefficient of the Cu/Cu metal layer26 (SCu ∼ +1.28 μV K−1) from the measured Seebeck coefficient of the Cu sandwiched samples (Cu/MoS2/Cu, SCu/MoS2/Cu).

The electrical potential difference (ΔV) between the bottom and top of the sample under the temperature gradient was measured to obtain the cross-plane Seebeck thermopower of the samples (top image). The schematic (bottom-left image) shows the measurement system used for both the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity of the sample along the cross-plane direction (i.e., z-axis direction). The micro-Peltier was used as a heater. The temperature difference (ΔT) was generated between the ends of the films along the z-direction (i.e., bottom to top). The temperature distribution in this system was calculated by using COMSOL Multiphysics software at ΔT = 6 K (bottom-right image). (b) Schematic images for measuring the in-plane Seebeck thermopower of the MoS2 thin film. The ΔV between the ends of the samples under the temperature gradient was measured to obtain the in-plane Seebeck coefficient of the samples (top image). The schematic (bottom-left image) shows the measurement system used for both the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity of the sample along the in-plane direction (i.e., x-axis direction). The strain gauge was used as a heater. The ΔT was generated between the ends of the films along the x-direction (i.e., left to right). The temperature distribution in the MoS2 film on the SiO2/Si substrate during the in-plane Seebeck coefficient measurement at ΔT = 10 was calculated by using COMSOL Multiphysics software (bottom-left image). 

Fig. 1b shows a schematic image of the in-plane Seebeck coefficient measurements of the 2D MoS2 films, in which a temperature gradient was applied from left to right. As shown in the figure, the CVD-grown 2D MoS2 films were transferred onto the insulating SiO2/Si substrate, and the top electrodes were then formed at the ends of the samples by using a metal shadow mask. In the in-plane Seebeck coefficient measurement (Fig. 1b), a strain gauge of 120 Ω as heat and two T-type thermocouples for controlling the temperature were attached to the top of the Cu plate and to the dummy substrate, which was bridged between the Cu plate and the block.27 All measurements were performed in a microprobe system, as reported in the literature, for measuring the longitudinal and transverse spin Seebeck effect.28–31 The ΔT and measured ΔV values of the samples were monitored and controlled using CompactDAQ with LabVIEW software (National Instruments, USA). In this system, the temperature difference varied from 1 to 10 K with excellent thermal stability using the micro-Peltier modules and the stain gauge in the microprobe system.26 For other CVD-grown 2D-layer TMDC films, specifically WSe2 and WS2 films, we used the same measurement procedure for in- and cross-plane Seebeck coefficients as that used for the MoS2 films. Fig. 1a and b show the heat flow distribution and electrical potential (i.e., TE Seebeck voltage) in the cross- and in-plane Seebeck coefficient measurement system, ΔT = 10 K at the Cu/MoS2/Cu layers and the Cu/MoS2/SiO2/Si substrate, respectively, using a multiphasic finite element method (FEM) simulator (COMSOL Multiphysics, Inc., USA) with a heat transfer module for thermal simulation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Materials characteristics of holey MoS2 thin films
The transfer of CVD-grown TMDCs from SiO2/Si onto target substrates has been successfully achieved in previous research by using a sacrificial poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film to support the TMDCs and subsequent etching of SiO2 in alkali- or HF-based solutions.32–34 In particular, Kwon et al. observed the number of the pinholes on the MoS2 thin films after the transfer process in the HF-only etchant.32 Based on this observation, we intentionally immersed MoS2-grown SiO2/Si substrates into a dilute HF etchant (5 wt%) for 60 s to create a holey structure and subsequently transferred them onto the target substrates. Fig. 2a shows a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image of a chemically formed holey MoS2 thin film, indicating the presence of a large number of holes with various diameters of ∼1 to 5 μm. The formation of a holey structure was assumed to be related to a fast SiO2 etch rate in HF-only etchants (SiO2 etch rate ∼30 nm s−1). Generally, the HF-only etchant has higher wettability for the buried SiO2 layer between the PMMA polymer and the Si substrate, leading to accelerated chemical etching on the defect Mo sites caused by rapid detachment of the PMMA/MoS2 layer and consequent formation of a holey structure. To further investigate the surface topographic features, we employed AFM in the non-contact mode. Fig. 2b shows the AFM mapping image of the MoS2 thin film with holes that was transferred to the SiO2 (300 nm)/p-Si substrate. The color AFM image shows a uniform color distribution on the surface of the MoS2 layer, indicating that the chemically formed holey MoS2 thin film has a smooth and clean surface. In addition, the average thickness of the MoS2 thin film was about ∼7 nm, corresponding to the AFM height profile (blue-dotted line, A–B) as shown in Fig. 2c. The topological characteristics of the holey MoS2 thin film were also identified by Raman mapping of the intensity of E12g and A1g, with wavenumbers of ∼383.3 cm−1 and ∼407.4 cm−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2d and e. These results are highly consistent with the AFM topographic image (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2f shows the Raman spectra from two different positions labeled C and D representing the surface and hole regions, respectively. The two peaks appeared at ∼383.3 and ∼407.4 cm−1 on the surface of the MoS2 layer, which were assigned to the E12g and A1g mode frequencies, and they were excited by using a 514.5 nm layer source.35 On the contrary, the absence of both modes in the hole region was generally considered to represent the disappearance of the MoS2 layer after the transfer process in the dilute HF etchant. In order to gain an in-depth understanding of the configuration of the MoS2 thin film, a cross-sectional TEM specimen was prepared by focused-ion beam (FIB) ion milling. Fig. 2g and h show cross-sectional HR-TEM images for the MoS2 thin film, indicating the formation of ∼6 nm-thick MoS2 consisting of 11 multilayers. According to the intensity profile shown in Fig. 2i, the average interplanar d-spacing of the (002) planes was determined to be 0.626 nm, indicating that our MoS2 thin film is a 2D-layered material with layers bounded to each other by van der Waals force (d-spacing = ∼0.62).32,36,37 Furthermore, cross-sectional STEM imaging with EDS mapping was performed to confirm the existence of Mo and S elements constituting the 2D-layered MoS2 thin film. Fig. 2j shows the elemental mapping images for Si (red), Mo (green), and S (pink), corresponding to the STEM image. Thus, the Mo and S elemental distributions were mostly consistent with the thickness of the 2D-layered MoS2 thin film; Si element from the insulating SiO2/Si substrate was also observed. These results confirm the successful fabrication of the chemically formed holey MoS2 thin film comprising 11 2D-stacked multilayers using dilute HF solution, which can be helpful for understanding the in- and cross-plane thermoelectric properties depending on morphological characteristics such as holey structures.

3.2 Cross-plane Seebeck coefficients of MoS2, WSe2, and WS2 films

Fig. 3a shows the TE Seebeck potential difference in the measured voltage in the cross-plane direction between the top and bottom Cu metal (inset image in Fig. 3a) as a function of the time and temperature difference from 1 to 10 K. The results showed excellent thermal stability at each temperature difference, which confirms that the temperature difference in the cross-plane Seebeck thermopower measurement system was effectively controlled with low variation, <0.4%. In addition, such a measurement system is amenable for reliable in- and cross-plane Seebeck thermopower measurements of very thin films formed by TMDC material. Fig. 3b shows the photo-switching behavior of films formed by the MoS2 layer in the in-plane direction based on the application of electric light illumination at a fixed temperature difference of ΔT = 1 K. The results showed a change of approximately 3 μV in the in-plane voltage measurement owing to the photo-current response to the light illumination. These results further confirm that CVD-grown MoS2 films can be a promising photo-detector because they optimizes the device structure and thickness of the samples. This is because the absorption spectrum of MoS2 is well matched with the solar spectrum with proper absorption coefficients of 104 to 106 cm−1. Previous research on single-layer MoS2 photo-detectors demonstrated high photo-responsivity with a fast response time.38,39 Further research on the new photo-controlled Seebeck coefficients or TE devices with a more specific light source will be conducted on the basis of the results obtained from this experiment.

Insets show photographs of the measurement module and schematic. The measured (g) cross-plane Seebeck thermopower and (h) the values for MoS2, WSe2, and WS2, are also shown. 

Fig. 3c shows the potential difference of large-area MoS2 films across the in- and cross-plane directions as a function of the temperature difference of 1 to 10 K, showing good linearity with R2 = 0.9999 and R2 = 0.99 for the in- and cross-plane measurements, respectively. As a result, the in- and the cross-plane Seebeck coefficients can be evaluated by linearly fitting ΔV versus ΔT, as shown in Fig. 3c. As shown in Fig. 3d, the measured Seebeck coefficients across the in- and cross-plane directions of CVD-grown MoS2 were determined to be 742 and 115 μV K−1, respectively at 300 K, achieving high Seebeck coefficients with a high anisotropic ratio of ∼6.5 in these films. This positive value of the Seebeck coefficient demonstrates that CVD-grown MoS2 has p-type conduction. This result can be explained by the interface interaction between the MoS2 layer and CuO substrate. During the wet transfer process, O dangling bonds are generated at the CuO surface by oxygen plasma treatment, which leads to p-type electrical properties in MoS2 without any doping process. This phenomenon is well consistent with previous studies in the literature.40–44 In Section 3.3, we discuss the cross-plane Seebeck coefficient (S⊥) and in-plane Seebeck coefficient (S‖) of large-area MoS2 films. Fig. 3d shows the values of the Seebeck coefficient (∼115 μV K−1) of films formed by the MoS2 layer for the first time using a reliable measurement system. As discussed in Section 1, no experimental information is available for S⊥ of films formed by the MoS2 layer. As reported previously, the measured S⊥ and S‖ of CVD-grown MoS2 films were approximately 2.3 and 44 times higher than those for pristine MoS2 bulk at 300 K, respectively.45 This high S⊥ can be explained by their low dimensionality with low electrical conductivity (σ⊥, Fig. 3e) and naturally formed atomic-scale 2D MoS2 films, whereas the DOS was strongly increased owing to the quantum confinement in the MoS2 films. For low-dimensional materials, the Seebeck coefficient can be expressed by the Bethe–Sommerfeld expansion of the Mott relation:46,47 (1)where e is the electron charge, DOS(E) is the energy-dependent electronic DOS, n(E) is the energy-dependent number of states, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and μ(E) is the energy-dependent electron mobility. In the layered structure of MoS2 films, the quantum confinement effect in the MoS2 films leads to an increase in the DOS density at the Fermi level, resulting in increased Seebeck thermopower in the layered MoS2 films. Similar behavior has been observed previously in superlattice films.2,4,8 As shown in Fig. 3e, the in- (σ‖) and cross-plane (σ⊥) electrical conductivity of the MoS2 film at 300 K was determined to be ∼786 and ∼1 × 10−4 S m−1, respectively, resulting in an enhancement of the S‖ value of the films by suppression of the σ‖ values. These results agree well with eqn (1), which describes the relationship between the σ‖ and S‖ of the sample. Furthermore, we compared the measured S⊥ of our MoS2 thin film and those of other TMDC materials, specifically WSe2 and WS2, through curve fitting using a linear polynomial, as shown in Fig. 3f. The average thicknesses of the WS2 and WSe2 thin films were ∼8 and ∼14 nm, respectively (Fig. S1†), and the evaluated S⊥ at 300 K was determined to be 129 and 211 μV K−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3g. As with the measured S⊥ of the MoS2 thin film (115 μV K−1), the measured S⊥ of WSe2 and WS2 was also larger than that of pristine bulk, which corresponds to the thickness effect on the DOS for the TMDC sample.48–50
As shown in Fig. 3d, the anisotropy in Seebeck thermopower was determined to be 6.5 at room temperature. As discussed above, we measured the S⊥ of the MoS2 thin film using a reliable measurement system for the first time; thus no experimental data of the MoS2 thin film are available to compare the anisotropy in the Seebeck coefficient. Instead, we compared the anisotropy using the measurement data for WS2 film, which is a well-known TMDC material.24 Because TMDC materials are formed by stacking of monolayers and retention by van der Waals force,51,52 the trend of the anisotropy value in the Seebeck coefficient is similar to that of other TMDC films. The measured S‖ and S⊥ were 620 and 112 μV K−1 at 300 K, resulting in anisotropy of ∼5.5 for the WS2 film. When comparing the anisotropy value, our result was slightly larger than that of the WS2 film.24 The thickness effect on the DOS has little influence on anisotropy in Seebeck thermopower because it affects both S‖ and S⊥, respectively. Thus, this result is mainly attributed to the increase in S‖ in the MoS2 thin film caused by the holey structure, as shown in Fig. 2a. This result is discussed further in Section 3.3.
On the basis of the measured electrical conductivity (Fig. 3e) and the Seebeck coefficient (Fig. 3d) in both the in- and cross-plane directions, the power factor (PF = S2σ) of CVD-grown TMDC films was calculated. As shown in Fig. S2a in the ESI,† the calculated in- (PF‖) and cross-plane (PF⊥) power factors of the MoS2 films were ∼432.6 and ∼1.8 × 10−6 μW m−1 K−2, respectively at 300 K, achieving an extremely high anisotropic ratio  of ∼2.4 × 108. The calculated PF‖ of the large-area MoS2 films was approximately twice that of a similar CVD-grown MoS2 monolayer24 with a carrier density of 1013 cm−2 at ∼200 μW m−1 K−2. This superior result corresponds to the previously reported value for O2-doped MoS2 bulk materials, at ∼300–400 μW m−1 K−2 in both the in- and cross-plane directions.45 Accordingly, this high PF‖ and  clearly indicate that large-area MoS2 films can be ideal TE devices in the in-plane direction when optimizing the structure and carrier concentration. In addition, the calculated PF⊥ of WSe2 and WS2 films were ∼2.8 × 10−7 and ∼1.9 × 10−7 μW m−1 K−2 at 300 K (Fig. S2b in the ESI†), respectively, based on the measured cross-plane Seebeck coefficient (Fig. 3g) and electrical conductivity (Fig. 3h) of the films.
3.3 In-plane Seebeck coefficients of CVD-grown MoS2 films
As previously mentioned, the in-plane Seebeck thermopower of our MoS2 thin film was larger than that of other reported MoS2 films including MoS2 bulk,24,45,50,53 which was measured to be 742 μV K−1 as shown in Fig. 3d. This phenomenon can be explained by morphological characteristics such as the holey structure in the MoS2 thin film. As shown in Fig. 2a and 4a, we confirmed through SEM observation that our MoS2 thin film contains holes in various diameters of ∼1 to ∼5 μm. Two notable effects of these holes on the in-plane Seebeck thermopower of the MoS2 thin film were noted. First, an increase in the in-plane Seebeck thermopower observed for the MoS2 thin film with holes over that without holes can be explained by an increase in the porosity of the film. When employing the effective medium theories for the MoS2 thin film with holes, the Seebeck thermopower can be expressed as54 (2)where q is the carrier charge; μ* is the reduced chemical potential (μ* = μ/kBT); η is the scattering parameter depending on the dominant scattering mechanism, e.g., η = 2 for carrier scattering on acoustic phonons and η = 4 for scattering on ionized impurities; and ϕeffp is the effective porosity (0 < ϕeffp < 1). According to eqn (2), the S‖ of the MoS2 thin film with holes was always larger than that of the MoS2 thin film owing to its porosity, which is consistent with that reported in the literature.54–56 Specifically, Lee et al. showed thorough Boltzmann transport calculation that Seebeck thermopower increases when the pore size is not only on the nanometer scale but also on the micrometer scale.56 Second, the increase in the Seebeck thermopower in MoS2 films with holey structures is attributed to the energy filtering effect in the films, which increases the S‖ of the MoS2 thin film. In Fig. 4b and c, the chemically formed holes in the MoS2 thin film are regarded as scattering sites due to a potential difference, which leads to an energy filtering effect near the hole sites. Thus, the Seebeck thermopower of the MoS2 thin film with holes can be expressed from the Boltzmann transport equation as57–63 (3)where T is the absolute temperature, E is the energy of the carriers, τ(E) is the relaxation time, f(E) is the Fermi distribution function, and Eb is the potential barrier height obtained from the holes. As shown in Fig. 4c, low-energy carriers are filtered out at the boundary of the charge trap at the interface of the holes, whereas the carriers with high energy can easily pass through them without disruption of the hole. As a result, the increase in the average energy of the carriers (Fig. 4c), enhances the in-plane Seebeck thermopower of the MoS2 thin films with holes. The in-plane electrical conductivity of the this MoS2 thin film was determined to be ∼785 S m−1 at room temperature (Fig. 3e), which is more than 100 times lower than that of the MoS2 thin film without holes.64,65 This result can be fully explained by the energy filtering effect on the Seebeck thermopower of the films.

4. Conclusions
We investigated the cross-plane Seebeck thermopower properties of CVD-prepared 2D large-area MoS2, WSe2, and WS2 TMDC thin films at 300 K. In particular, the Seebeck coefficients of the large-area MoS2 films with chemically formed holey structures were measured along the in- and cross-plane directions for evaluating anisotropic properties at temperature differences of 1 to 10 K. The chemically formed holey structure of the MoS2 thin films exhibited superior in-plane Seebeck coefficients of ∼742 μV K−1 and strong anisotropic behavior with a ratio of ∼6.5. This can be explained by the porosity of the holey structure and the energy filtering effect in the film. Therefore, large-area MoS2 films can be ideal TE devices in the in-plane direction if their structure and carrier concentration are optimized. Furthermore, the methodology proposed here for evaluating the TE properties of TMDC films will be extremely useful for understanding additional electronic and phononic properties in future studies.
