    , Accepted 11th April 2022First published on 25th April 2022AbstractCarbon nano-onions (CNOs), one of the most promising carbon nanoforms, have drawn interest worldwide and have been applied extensively in electronics, photovoltaics, catalysis, and biomedical diagnostics. Conventional synthetic techniques of CNOs require harsh experimental conditions, such as high temperature and vacuum, are time consuming, or require high-cost carbon sources, extra catalysts, and hazardous strong acids/bases; these are significant drawbacks that hinder the facile synthesis of CNOs. Herein, we report a novel preparation of ultra-bright CNOs via a one-step microwave pyrolysis of fish scale waste within seconds. Simultaneous surface functionalization of CNOs is also established at the synthesis stage. The highly crystallized multiple-shelled core-state and well-functionalized surface of the obtained CNOs facilitates a visible photoluminescence with a narrow emission width less than 90 nm and a superior quantum yield of 40%, which is the highest value and 10-fold higher compared with the existing CNOs conventionally prepared via the much more complicated approaches. Excellent dispersibility along with a steady emission in various polar solvents and solid-state lighting applications such as blue-light-emitting flexible film and LED was also achieved. The presented super-facile and versatile synthetic technique for high-performance CNOs presents a novel opportunity for the green and sustainable synthesis of advanced functional nanomaterials.
Introduction
Carbon-based nanoforms involving amorphous aggregates, few layered quasi-sphered graphene core, spheric fullerenes, and hollow nano-onions have been widely applied in electronics, photovoltaics, catalysis, and biomedical diagnostics owing to their extraordinary electrical and optical features with superior chemical inertness, low cytotoxicity, and cost-efficiency.1–6 The carbon nano-onion (CNO) with a unique multiple enclosed fullerene-like shell structure, which was first observed by transmission electron microscopy as a by-product obtained in the synthesis of carbon black in 1980,7 has drawn extensive attention worldwide in terms of energy storage and conversion. This is owing to its exceptionally high electrical and thermal conductivity, as well as large external surface area.8–13 Through post surface engineering afforded by covalent and non-covalent functionalization, water-soluble CNOs have been successfully applied in biotechnology, such as in in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo bio-imaging and sensing, and in drug delivery.14–16 Pech et al. successfully fabricated micrometre-sized supercapacitors by utilizing onion-like carbon and attained a superior capacitance and volumetric energy that were significantly higher than those of conventional electrolytic capacitors.11 Mohapatra et al. developed dye-sensitized solar cells with a significant solar energy conversion efficiency by taking advantage of the excellent optical transparency and high electrical conductivity of CNO as an electrode.12 Wei et al. reported a large enhancement of the thermal conductivity of epoxy composites by embedding CNOs as an effective thermal network.13 Furthermore, Sarkar et al. studied a common food chain by introducing CNOs as a bioimaging agent into unicellular and multicellular organisms.14
Kuzenetsov et al. reported the vacuum annealing of a nano diamond precursor under high-temperatures (1500–2000 °C), which was the very first large-scale synthesis of CNOs; notably, this process has become one of the most utilized conventional CNO synthetic techniques.17 Other synthetic approaches such as arc discharge, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), ion implantation, mechanochemical processes, and laser ablation have also been established. Arc discharge between two graphite electrodes in water was demonstrated for the preparation of CNOs with perfectly crystallized enclosed graphene layers under the extreme heat generated in a localized hot plasma zone.18 In CVD systems, the decomposition of ethylene gas with magnesium–oxide-supported cobalt as the catalyst was utilized for the generation of CNOs.19 Furthermore, through carbon ion implantation into a polycrystalline silver substrate target at a constant temperature of 500 °C, a CNO thin film was obtained.20 Estrada-Guel et al. reported the preparation of CNO through a mechanochemically initiated reaction between graphite powder and an aluminium catalyst through high-energy ball-milling for 1 h, followed by a leaching process with hydrochloric acid; however, the obtained CNOs exhibited poor crystallization and a large, hollow center.21 Yang et al. reported the production of CNO by the liquid-phase laser ablation of a toluene precursor on a silicon (Si) target.22 Nevertheless, silicon carbide nanoparticles in the resultant CNO suspension were observed to be contaminated, which was the main limitation. Li et al. recently obtained hollow and solid CNOs through a novel electrochemical synthesis by utilizing toluene as a precursor. Specifically, electrolysis was performed for 10 h; moreover, post-treatment was required at 450 °C for 3 h for the further separation and purification of the final products.23 However, the observed pristine CNOs in the aforementioned cases were insoluble in both polar and non-polar solvents owing to robust intermolecular van de Waals and π-stacking forces, indicating the need for post-treatment via surface passivation for further solution-process based applications. Although water-soluble CNOs can be obtained by several liquid-phase synthetic methods, the chemical structural control of both the core and surface is rather complicated and lacks a clear reaction mechanism; meanwhile, the performance of the resultant CNOs is not attenuated. For example, Sun et al. reported the preparation of water-dispersible CNOs through the sonication of candle soot in sulfuric acid–nitric acid mixed solutions at 50 °C.24 Bhattacharyya et al. observed N,P-co-doped CNO using chitosan gel and phosphoric acid as precursors via the hydrothermal approach at 600 °C for 8 h.5 In addition, Ghosh et al. reported the synthesis of fluorescent CNOs via the thermal pyrolysis of wood wool at 600 °C under a nitrogen:oxygen flow for 2 h, followed by purification with highly concentrated nitric acid and filtration.25 Although the obtained CNOs exhibited visible photoluminescence (PL), a very low quantum yield (QY) of 3% was attained. Using a strong alkali (sodium hydroxide) as a catalyst for the thermal pyrolysis of tomato at 240 °C in an oxygen atmosphere for 2 h, Ahmed et al. achieved emissive CNOs (QY = 1.32%).26 As summarized in Table 1, these techniques exhibit the disadvantages of harsh experimental conditions such as a high temperature and vacuum, time consuming, and utilizing high-cost carbon sources, extra catalysts, and hazardous strong acids/bases, which limit the possibility of the facile synthesis of CNOs.

In this work, we report the super-facile and smart synthesis of ultrafine CNOs with high crystallinity via the one-step microwave pyrolysis of fish scale waste as a precursor in seconds. Owing to the sufficient microwave absorption property of fish collagen, an extremely rapid increase in temperature occurs in the local E-field of the microwaves and facilitates the pyrolysis of fish scales, as shown in Scheme 1. Moreover, simultaneous surface functionalization occurs during the synthesis of the obtained CNOs, resulting in an ultra-bright visible emission; remarkably, a narrow emission width of less than 90 nm and superior QY of 40% were achieved. To the best of our knowledge, the CNOs prepared in this study exhibit the highest QY compared with those of previously reported CNOs prepared via significantly more complicated approaches (as described in Table 1). In addition, excellent solubility, a steady PL, and a high QY in various polar solvents are accomplished simultaneously. Furthermore, such superior optical behaviour also is retained in solid-state lighting applications based on a large-area flexible film and LED. The synthetic approach toward high-performance CNOs demonstrated in this study presents a novel opportunity for the green development of advanced functional materials, thereby significantly contributing to the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs).

Experimental
Synthesis of CNOs via microwave pyrolysis of fish scale
Fish scales (obtained from black snappers) were first pre-treated by soaking in Na2CO3 to remove surface fats and pigments, and then decalcified in HCl according to a reported method.27 After washing with deionized water, the fish scales were separated one by one carefully and completely dried in a hood at room temperature (25–30 °C). As for the microwave pyrolysis, a TE-104 mode 2.45 GHz cylindrical microwave cavity and a self-constructed system with a separated E-field were utilized. As shown in Scheme 1, the pre-treated fish scale was loaded on an alumina stage that was then settled into a quartz tube and pyrolyzed at the E-field centre of the microwave under an optimized output power of 390 W. Argon gas with a constant flow rate of 500 ml min−1 was introduced continuously into the quartz tube during pyrolysis. The temperature of the sample was detected using a radiation pyrometer (FLHX-TNE-0160, JAPANSENSOR Corp.). As microwave irradiation proceeded, a rapid temperature increase occurred on the fish scale spontaneously followed by a self-cooling process. After this microwave induced spontaneous pyrolysis ended, the pyrolyzed fish scale was collected (yield to fish scale: ∼51.8%) and ground using a mortar and pestle, accompanied by ethanol addition. After filtration using a hydrophilic PTFE membrane with a pore size of 100 nm, the ethanol dispersion of CNOs (solid yield to fish scale: ∼29.2%) was obtained and was ready for characterization. CNOs dispersed in different polar solvents such as water, methanol, and isopropanol were prepared by evaporating the original ethanol solvent in vacuum and re-dissolving.
Deposition of CNO/PVA film and fabrication of CNO LED
First, an aqueous polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution with a concentration of 10 wt% was prepared. Then, a water dispersion of CNOs with a concertation of 6 mg ml−1 was added into the PVA solution and mixed well by stirring for 10 min. The volume ratio between the PVA and CNO solutions was 3:1. CNOs embedded PVA film, and reference bare PVA film were deposited on a polypyrene substrate via a commercial tape-casting system under a fixed blade height (6 mm). Dried films could then be easily exfoliated by hand after removing the water they contained at room temperature (25–30 °C). As for the fabrication of the CNO LED, the well-mixed CNO/PVA solution was drop-casted onto a commercial 375 nm UV LED chip.
Characterizations
The morphology and size of the obtained CNOs were confirmed using atomic resolution high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM: JEM-ARM200, JEOL Ltd), during which the crystallinity and composition were investigated via equipped small area electron diffraction (SAED) and the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-vis fluorescence spectrometer (V-750, JASCO Corp.). The two-dimensional (2D) and 3D PL and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra of CNOs dispersed in ethanol solution were measured using a fluorescence spectrometer (FP-8500, JASCO Corp.). The absolute QY was estimated using a commercial instrument (Quantaurus-QY, Hamamatsu Photonics). The chemical states of the CNOs were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS: M-probe SSX-100, Surface Science Instruments) with an Al-Kα source. The shift in the binding energy due to the surface charge-up of the sample was calibrated using the Au4f level spectra at 83.98 eV. The chemical structures of the pre-treated fish scales before and after microwave pyrolysis were analysed using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer equipped with an attenuated total reflection unit (ATR-FT/IR) spectroscopy (FT/IR-V6000, JASCO Corp.) with a diamond prism. The carbon structure in the pyrolyzed fish scales was investigated by Raman spectroscopy (inVia Raman spectroscope, Renishaw, plc.) with a 532 nm laser. The gases generated during microwaving were collected in a PTFE sample bag and the chemical compositions were identified by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC/MS: GCT Premier, Waters Corp.) equipped with a fused silica column (Rxi-624Si MS, Restek Corp.).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a–d illustrate the HR-TEM images with the SAED patterns of the prepared sample. Onion-like hollow carbons adjusted to sizes ranging from 20 to 50 nm were observed. Moreover, multiple highly crystallized shells of graphene were observed to clearly exhibit lattice fringes corresponding to the interlayer (002) plane (d-spacing = 0.355). The SAED pattern also exhibited a pair of small and intense arcs corresponding to the (002) plane. In addition, a thin amorphous or passivated layer was observed on the CNO surface. As shown in the EDX spectra presented in Fig. 1e, highly concentrated carbon was detected with a small co-existing amount of oxygen; here, the existence of trace Cu and Si originated from the TEM grid utilized. It demonstrates that the presented catalyst-free synthesis of CNO facilitates a pure carbon content and avoids the involving of contamination of unwanted elements.

The surface chemical state of the prepared CNOs was then analysed via XPS in detail, and the full area, C1s, O1s, and N1s orbital spectra are shown in Fig. 2a–d. In the full spectra shown in Fig. 2a, main peaks from C1s, O1s, and N1s appeared, while peaks of Au and Si also originated from the gold wire used for correction and glass substrate used for the drop-casting of the CNO dispersion, respectively. Following further peak deconvolution via fitting analysis, five species at binding energy levels of 284.2, 285.1, 286.3, 287.9, 289.1, and 290.1 eV, assigned to CC sp2, C–C/C–H sp3, C–OH, CO, HO–CO, and π–π* stacking,28–30 were observed in the C1s XPS spectra (Fig. 2b). In the case of the O1s orbital (Fig. 2c), the main spectra can be separated into three components corresponding to C–OH, CO, and H–O–CO at 529.9, 531.3, and 532.6 eV, respectively.28–30 An additional peak appeared at a higher energy region of approximately 536.7 eV and was regarded as a satellite peak that indicates the presence of extended delocalized π–π* electrons in the synthesized CNOs with an ultrafine crystallinity of graphene.28 The XPS spectrum of the N1s orbital, as shown in Fig. 2d, consists of two peaks that appear at 398.9 and 400.0 eV and can be assigned to pyridinic and pyrrolic N species.31,32 Therefore, the surface of the CNO is simultaneously functionalized by carboxylic/hydroxyl groups and a small amount of pyridinic/pyrrolic N atoms during the one-step rapid heating process in the microwave pyrolysis stage. With regard to the HR-TEM and XPS results ascribed above, our one-step synthesized CNOs exhibit neither an ultra-fine highly crystallized multiple-shelled structures as that synthesized conventionally in high-temperature annealing of nano-diamond nor a well-functionalized surface as CNOs that are synthesized by high-temperature thermal pyrolysis in liquid phase. In other words, the as demonstrated solid-state synthesis of CNOs through microwave pyrolysis of fish scale waste in the present work perfectly overcomes the drawback in the high-temperature annealing of the nano-diamond approach that only generates a bare surface that lacked dispersibility in both polar and non-polar solvents, and also overcomes the problems of low crystallinity formation in CNOs synthesized from liquid phase-thermal pyrolysis.

The optical properties of the synthesized CNOs, including UV-visible electronic absorption spectra, 2D and 3D PL and PLE spectra, and PL decay, are summarized in Fig. 3. As indicated by the red curve in Fig. 3a, continuous absorption from the UV-visible region tail to 500 nm was detected, where the two characteristic peaks at 275 and 345 nm originated from the π–π* transition of CC and n–π* transition of CO on the surface.32 The blue curve displays the PL of CNO excited at a wavelength of 350 nm. Visible emission with a narrow emission width (below 90 nm) and exceptionally high intensity (approximately 450 nm) was observed. Furthermore, as revealed by the 3D PL and PLE matrix in Fig. 3b, two emissive components were identified. Combined with the results of Fig. 3a, we suggest that the excitation-wavelength-dependent emission at 300–400 nm with the PL centre at approximately 450 nm can be attributed to the variable surface state of the CNOs, whereas the excitation-wavelength independent emission at 280–300 nm was ascribed to exciton recombination through π–π* transitions.33,34 As exemplified by the images of CNO dispersed in ethanol under ambient light and UV light in Fig. 3c, a bright blue emission was clearly observed. The absolute QY was measured as 40% for the PL centre at the excitation wavelength of 350 nm. This is not only the highest value among those of previously reported photoluminescent CNOs (as 10-fold higher than previous reports as indicated by Table 1) but also higher than those of all other carbon nanoforms generated from natural sources reported previously. Such a superior QY may be attributed to the high crystallinity of the core state in the CNOs and the well-passivated surface, which hinders the trapping of excited electrons in defect centres and suppresses non-irradiative recombination dynamics, induces efficient hole–electron recombination. Fig. 3d shows the nano-second order PL decay of CNOs at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. The fluorescence lifetime of CNOs was estimated as 7.2 ns correspondingly. Such results show good consistency with the emissions from the surface states of carbon nanostructures previously reported.35,36Fig. 3e reveals the perfect dispersibility of CNOs in different polar solvents such as water, methanol, and isopropanol; notably, the emission and QY values were 100% recovered to those obtained in the case of ethanol.

By simply mixing the synthesized CNOs into an aqueous solution of PVA, a CNO film was successfully deposited via tape-casting followed by the evaporation of water; this process is illustrated in Fig. 4a. The exfoliated CNO film was super flexible and exhibited bright solid-state emission under UV irradiation even at a rather low exact concentration of CNOs (2 mg ml−1), as shown in Fig. 4b. Furthermore, Fig. 4c presents the 3D PL/PLE matrices of the CNOs-embedded and bare PVA films. In contrast with the non-emissive bare PVA film, the CNO-embedded one exhibited two-component emission that corresponded well with the PL of solvent-dispersed CNOs given by Fig. 3b. In addition, a CNO LED device was fabricated by depositing the above CNO/PVA film onto a UV LED chip, as indicated by Fig. 4d. Bright blue-light electroluminescence was obtained when voltage was applied to the chip (see Fig. 4e), whose spectrum was recorded as shown in Fig. 4f. Furthermore, the result of colour identification via Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) 1931 figure is presented as Fig. 4g. The red circle at the excitation wavelength of 350 nm has the coordinate (0.204, 0.230) in the CIE XYZ colour space; thus, its chromaticity coordinate can be estimated as (0.012, 0.320, 0.668) in the CIE RGB colour space. Therefore, the fabricated LED exhibits blue-light emission owing to the active CNOs.

Finally, we also attempted to investigate the formation mechanism of CNOs through the microwave pyrolysis of fish scales as follows. The chemical structure of the pre-washed fish scale precursor before and after pyrolysis was characterized by ATR-FT/IR and Raman spectroscopies, and the gas generated during microwave pyrolysis was collected and analysed through GC/MS. In the ATR-FT/IR spectrum of the pre-washed fish scales, shown in Fig. 5a, peaks appeared at 1160, 1550, and 1240 cm−1, which were assigned to amides I, II, and III, respectively, in the multiple amino-acids of collagen. Furthermore, the peaks of N–H, CO, CH2, and O–H were confirmed at 3300–3400, 1424, 2800–3100, and near 3000 cm−1, respectively.37 These peaks corroborate the fact that the collagen in black snapper is mainly formed by amino-acid species such as glycine, alanine, proline, and hydroxyproline, which are polymerized with inter-molecular peptide bonds (H–N–CO) through dehydration.38 Notably, such peptide bonds possess a strong dipole moment (3.5 D per moment), which leads to the formation of macrodipoles through the parallel alignment of dipoles with the axis in the triple-helical structure of collagen.39,40 Such a strong dipole moment as well as the hydroxyl groups in fish scale collagen can lead to exceptional E-field microwave absorption. As indicated by the GC/MS spectrum of the gas sample generated during pyrolysis, shown in Fig. 5b, various pentagonal and hexagonal molecules were detected. Toluene, the most generated species, has been widely utilized as a precursor for the synthesis of CNOs in various approaches.22,23 Pentagonal and hexagonal molecules have also been observed to play an important role in the assembly of fine and defect-free fullerene structures.15 In addition, the phenyl radical was identified based on the MS spectra, as demonstrated by Fig. S1.† Such benzyl radical cations, generated through the dehydrogenation of toluene, contribute to the dimerization and cross-linking reactions to form polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.23 The resultant large number of pyrroles, including 1-methyl-1H-pyrrole, pyrrole, 1-ethyl-1H-pyrrole, 2-methyl-1H-pyrrole, and pyrrole-2-carboxamide, might be derived from the pyrolyzed amino-acids. A small amount of diketopiperazines (DKPs), such as proline–glycine, glycine–alanine, and proline–alanine DKPs, produced via the dehydration and cyclization reaction of two-amino acids were also obtained.41Fig. 5c displays the ATR-FT/IR spectrum of fish scale after microwave pyrolysis. Chemical bonds of O–H, C–O and COOH are confirmed with the characteristic peak of aliphatic CH2 appears.42,43 With regard to Raman spectrum of pyrolyzed fish scale as given by Fig. 5d, G-band and D-band appears at 1580 and 1360 cm−1, which can be assigned as in-plane vibration of CC bond and atomic defect and stacking disorder of graphite structure, respectively.23,44 In good agreement with HR-TEM and XPS results given by Fig. 1 and 2, the chemical structure change of fish scale after microwave pyrolysis clearly suggests the formation of CNO with surface passivated by OH and COOH functional groups. Based on the aforementioned results, we infer that the formation mechanism of CNOs attained by the microwave pyrolysis of fish scales is as follows: (1) under E-field microwave irradiation, the peptide bonds, macro dipoles, and hydroxyl groups in the collagen structure of the fish scales absorbed the E-field microwaves sufficiently, and spontaneous pyrolysis was initiated owing to an extremely rapid increase in temperature, during which gaseous pentagons and hexagons such as toluene, pyrroles, and DKPs were generated; (2) phenyl radicals and the corresponding cations were produced through the dehydrogenation of toluene and other pentagonal/hexagonal molecules, and these participated in subsequent dimerization and cross-linking reactions to yield polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and a quasi-fullerene structure; (3) the enclosed single-layer carbon shell grew layer by layer and assembled into the final form of the CNOs gradually through the repetition of the reactions elucidated in (1) and (2) during the extremely fast heating and cooling in microwave pyrolysis. The above mechanism is summarized and shown in Fig. 5e.

Finally, we suggest that the “non-thermal effect” induced by microwave irradiation probably also serve an important role in facilitating the CNO formation during pyrolysis. As reported by Chen et al. previously,27 an altered nanoform of amorphous carbon dots were prepared in their conventional thermal pyrolysis (via an electronic furnace) of fish scale. By comparing the GC/MS spectra of gas products from microwave pyrolysis of fish scale with that of conventional thermal pyrolysis under the same maximum temperature of 350 °C (as given by Fig. S2 in the ESI†), the main gas species generated in conventional thermal pyrolysis can be confirmed as DKP, whose components are the same even for different heating rates, with toluene and pentagonal/hexagonal molecules (observed in microwave pyrolysis) missing. Observation of gas and solid products with different chemical structures has also been demonstrated in microwave pyrolysis and conventional thermal pyrolysis of polymeric materials previously, whose phenomenon is attributed to the microwave-induced non-thermal effect.45 Thus, we conclude that the selectively formed toluene and other pentagonal/hexagonal molecules through microwave irradiation-initiated pyrolysis established in the present work contributes to the facilitation of unique CNO structure as well as superior optical properties.
Conclusions
We developed a novel approach toward synthesizing ultra-bright and ultra-fine CNOs through the one-step microwave pyrolysis of fish scales within seconds. The core-state of highly crystallized multiple-shelled graphene and well-functionalized surface yields visible PL with a narrow emission width of less than 90 nm and a superior QY of 40% which is 10-fold higher than previously reported values. Such surface functionalization that occurs concurrently in the synthesis stage also facilitates excellent dispersibility in various polar solvents with 100% recovered PL and steady QY values. Furthermore, excellent optical behaviour is retained in solid-state lighting applications such as large-area flexible films and LEDs. We hypothesized that the unique collagen structure of fish scale induces sufficient E-field absorption and a rapid increase in temperature, whereas the pentagonal/hexagonal gases and corresponding radicals generated during pyrolysis probably facilitate the assembling of the CNOs through further dimerization and cross-linking reactions. Without employing harsh experimental conditions, high-cost carbon sources, extra catalysts, and hazardous strong acids/bases for pre-/post-treatment that are necessary in the conventional synthesis of CNOs, the super-facile synthetic technique presented herein and the high-performance of the obtained CNOs provide a brand-new strategy for the green and sustainable development of functional nanomaterials.
