    , Accepted 31st July 2015First published on 31st July 2015AbstractCadmium chalcogenide nanocrystals (CCNCs) are regarded as promising materials for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, the relatively low PEC response and poor stability restrict their practical applications. In the present work, we demonstrate that a well-designed inverse opal structure (IOS) composed of CCNCs can achieve an unprecedentedly high photocurrent and hydrogen production rate. In particular, the IOS electrode remains stable during 3 h of continuous illumination, which is even superior to those photoanodes with surface passivation and/or co-catalysts. Quantitative investigation reveals that the IOS possesses high charge-separation efficiency and light-absorption capacity, which eventually result in excellent PEC performance.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) splitting of water into hydrogen by the direct use of sunlight is an attractive and sustainable solution to the energy crisis and environmental problems.1–6 Since the pioneering work by Honda and Fujishima,6 tremendous efforts have been made to enhance the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH) of PEC cells. The exploitations of new light harvesters3,4,7 and electrode configurations8–10 are considered as two crucial aspects for enhancing overall efficiencies and device stabilities.
Recently, cadmium chalcogenide nanocrystals (CCNCs) have attracted extensive attention owing to their adjustable band gap,11,12 high extinction coefficient,13 and possible multiple exciton generation.14 Therefore, they are highly expected to be light harvesters in PEC cells.15–18 Nevertheless, the obtained STH efficiency of such materials is much lower than the theoretical value due to the drastic electron–hole recombination caused by the slow minor carrier (hole) transfer kinetics at the semiconductor/liquid interface.17,18 More importantly, the accumulated holes can cause serious anodic corrosion, which deteriorates the stability of the photoelectrodes.16,17
The common strategies to overcome these problems include constructing heterojunctions,17–19 adopting surface passivation,18 and adding co-catalysts17 so as to enhance the hole transfer and reduce the charge recombination. Recently, Seol et al. employed an IrOx catalyst to modify the CCNC-sensitized ZnO nanowires, and achieved an enhanced photocurrent which remained stable after 3 h of illumination.17 Even so, the PEC response and stability of CCNCs are still not satisfactory, which seriously limits their practical applications in PEC devices.
Another possible solution is to construct three-dimensional (3D) architectures, e.g. inverse opal structure (IOS), with CCNCs. As shown in Scheme 1, the IOS possesses several unique advantages. First, the periodically 3D ordered structure provides well control of incoming light via back reflections,17 multi-scattering,20 and surface resonance,21,22 causing intensive light absorption. Second, the thin walls of the IOS can dramatically reduce the diffusion length of holes, thus facilitating charge separation and depressing carrier recombination.23 Third, the continuous walls offer direct pathways for photo-generated electrons in CCNCs. Fourth, the high porosity of the IOS allows the infiltration of the electrolyte which extracts holes rapidly so as to inhibit the photocorrosion of CCNCs.
 Scheme 1  (a) Experimental setup for PEC water splitting, and (b) schematic structure of the IOS photoanode. 
Recently, several semiconductor materials, such as WO3,23,24 BiVO424–26 and Fe2O3,27 have been assembled into the IOS and applied in a water splitting system. However, as compared with thin film electrodes, the IOS based electrodes suffered from relatively low photocurrents.23–27 The crux is distinguished as the poor charge transfer in the IOS comprising fine nanocrystals, which dramatically compromises their advantageous light absorption and charge separation.
In the present work, we managed to prepare a highly conductive IOS of CCNSs and demonstrate its superiority in water splitting. First, we developed a two-step process to fabricate a well-designed IOS of CCNSs, where a primary IOS is produced via co-deposition and calcination, and then electrodeposition and annealing treatments were employed to improve the electrical conductivity. Next, we applied the IOS to water splitting and realized efficient hydrogen production. Specifically, the photocurrent density of the pure CdS IOS was 3.1 times that of the thin film electrode, the stability was even higher than those of CdS photoanodes with surface passivation and/or co-catalysts, and after being coated with a CdSe layer, the photocurrent density and hydrogen production rate reached 10.5 mA cm−2 and 98.2 μmol h−1 cm−2, respectively, which are the top values achieved by CCNCs. Finally, we quantitatively investigated the mechanism of how the IOS promotes PEC performance, and found that the IOS can transmit electrons as quick as a thin film does, while its light absorption and charge separation are 1.2 and 2.4 times those of the thin film, respectively; as a result, IOS achieves unprecedented PEC performance.
Experimental
Synthesis of the IOS
Polystyrene (PS) spheres and water-stable CdS QDs were co-assembled on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate following a procedure reported in our previous work.28 Then, the obtained film was calcined at 400 °C in air for 30 min to remove the PS spheres and produce the original CdS IOS. Afterwards, an extra CdS layer was grown on the IOS by electrodeposition (ED) to improve the electronic conductivity. The electrolyte for ED was prepared by dissolving 0.055 M CdCl2 and 0.19 M sulphur powder in 50 ml dimethyl sulfoxide at 110 °C. The ED time and current density were set at 10 min, and 0.5 mA cm−2, respectively. Finally, annealing treatment was conducted at 500 °C for 30 min in nitrogen.
Synthesis of the CdS film
The CdS film was synthesized as a reference through a physical vapor deposition (PVD) process. 0.1 g CdS powder was put into the middle of a tube furnace, heated to 710 °C, and held at the temperature for 30 min, and a FTO substrate was placed downstream in the low temperature area. Nitrogen carrier gas was introduced into the furnace tube at a flow rate of 300 standard cubic centimeter per minute during the deposition, and the total pressure was adjusted to 8 torr.29 Finally, a film with a thickness of ∼2 μm could be obtained at the distance of ∼14 cm away from the CdS source.
PEC measurements for water splitting
The PEC hydrogen evolution was tested in a standard three-electrode system under simulated AM 1.5 solar illumination (Scheme 1a). The IOS or thin film deposited on the FTO substrate served as the work electrode, a Pt plate as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. An aqueous solution of 0.25 M Na2S/0.35 M Na2SO3 was used as the electrolyte and sacrificial reagent.15,17,18
Characterization
The morphologies of the IOS and thin film were observed by using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV and a Tecnai G2 F20 transmission electron microscope (TEM) with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV. The composition was analyzed with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) module attached on a SEM. XRD measurements were carried out using a Bruker D/max 2500 v/pc diffractometer. The diffuse reflectance spectra and transmittance spectra were examined by using a Hitachi 3010 UV-vis absorption spectrometer with an integrating sphere. The linear sweep voltammetry measurements were examined by using a Versastat 3 potentiostat electrochemistry workstation at a scan rate of 0.05 V s−1. A 300 W Xe lamp calibrated by using a standard Si solar cell was used to simulate 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). The incident light was irradiated from the FTO side. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured with a tungsten quartz halogen light source, a monochromator, filters, reflective optics to provide monochromatic light, a mechanical chopper to modulate the light, and a transition impedance amplifier to provide the test device signal to a digital source meter (Keithley 2611). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on a Versastat 3 potentiostat electrochemistry workstation with a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The actual H2 production was detected every half an hour using a gas chromatograph (GC-2014C) possessing a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a molecular sieve 5 A column.
FDTD simulation
Light absorption in the CdS IOS and the thin film was simulated using commercial software, Lumerical. The parameters of the CdS material were adopted from the literature.30 The absorption profiles were calculated based on the formula Pabs = −0.5ω|E|2 imag(ε), where Pabs is the power absorption per unit volume, ω is the angular frequency, |E| is the electric field intensity and imag(ε) is the imaginary part of the permittivity. Then, the number of absorbed photons can be calculated by Pn = Pabs*λ/hc, where Pn is the number of absorbed photons per unit volume, λ is the wavelength, h is the Planck constant, and c is the speed of light.
Results and discussion
The CdS IOS was prepared via co-deposition and then calcination (Fig. S1†).28Fig. 1a presents a top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the original IOS with a pore size of 250 nm and a wall thickness of about 15 nm. Electrodeposition and annealing treatments were further adopted to improve the light absorption (Fig. S4†) and electrical conductivity of the original IOS. As shown in Fig. 1b, the wall thickness increased approximately to 60 nm via the post-treatments. Notably, this value is smaller than the hole diffusion length of CdS (100 nm).31 The side-view SEM image (Fig. S2†) indicates that the 2 μm-thick IOS contacts tightly with the conductive glass substrate, and provides a direct pathway for electron transport. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal that the CdS IOS possesses stoichiometric composition and a hexagonal phase structure (Fig. 1c), respectively, coinciding with the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (the inset of Fig. S3a†). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. S3†) show that the final IOS consists of highly crystalline nanocrystals with a grain size of 40–50 nm. This implies that the photo-generated holes can reach the electrolyte after the migration in just one nanocrystal, which is beneficial for hole extraction. Moreover, the increase in grain size and wall thickness after electrodeposition and annealing treatments directly results in improved light absorption and high conductivity of the IOS, and finally leads to improvement of PEC performance and stability (Fig. S5†).

(a) and (b) are top-view SEM images of the original CdS IOS (after co-deposition and calcination) and final IOS (after electrodeposition and annealing), respectively. (c) XRD (top) and EDS (bottom) patterns of the final IOS, respectively. (d) Mott–Schottky plot of the original and final IOS electrodes measured in a two-electrode system with a Pt film coated conductive glass substrate as the counter electrode. 
Mott–Schottky (M–S) analysis was conducted to identify the charge transfer capability of the original and final CdS IOSs. From the slope of M–S plots (Fig. 1d), the donor concentrations (Nd) of the original and the treated IOSs were calculated to be 6.8 × 1015 and 2.3 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. Hence, the electrical conductivity of the IOS is remarkably promoted after the electrodeposition and annealing treatments, and the carrier concentration of the IOS attains the same order of magnitude as that of the CdS film with columnar crystals (5 × 1016 cm−3).32
The treated CdS IOS was employed as the photoanode for PEC hydrogen evolution and tested in a standard three-electrode system under AM 1.5 solar radiation (Scheme 1). We choose an optimized vacuum evaporated 2 μm-thick CdS film as the control sample (Fig. S6–S8†). Fig. 2a displays the photocurrent density–potential (J–V) curves in the dark and under illumination, respectively. The IOS photoanode presents a higher photocurrent density than that of the CdS film. At 0 V versus Ag/AgCl, the IOS electrode achieves a photocurrent density of 3.1 mA cm−2 which is 3.1 times that of the film electrode (1 mA cm−2). Moreover, the IOS electrode exhibits an early potential onset comparable to the planar film, which reflects a high photovoltage and less carrier recombination in the IOS. However, the CdS film electrode with columnar crystals shows a plateau photocurrent, which arises from the relatively good electronic conductivity comparable to that of the IOS electrode.

(b) IPCE and APCE spectra under 1 sun AM1.5G illumination, at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode. (c) and (d) are photocurrent stability and time evolution of the IOS photoanode at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under AM 1.5 illumination, respectively. The dashed line in (d) is the calculated hydrogen evolution assuming 100% faradaic efficiency. 
Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) results are shown in Fig. 2b. The curves of both samples show an onset of photocurrent at 530 nm, corresponding to the band gap excitation of CdS. Obviously, the IOS electrode displays higher IPCE values in the overall spectrum region, with a maximum IPCE of ∼39% at 400–500 nm, which is 3-fold as high as that of the film electrode (∼13%). The absorbed photon to current conversion efficiency (APCE) value of the IOS electrode is much higher than that of the film in the whole tested wavelength. The IOS electrode achieves a maximum APCE of 45% at 480 nm, which is about 2.4 times that of the CdS film.
The stability of the IO and film electrodes was evaluated at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under continuous illumination of AM 1.5 (Fig. 2c). The photocurrent density–time (J–t) curve of IOS remained stable for 3 hours without obvious decay (J/J0 ∼ 1). XRD and SEM characterization shows that the crystal structure and morphology of the treated CdS IOS were well preserved after the stability test (Fig. S9†). In order to improve the photo-stability of CCNSs in PEC applications, CCNSs were usually loaded onto the surface of TiO2 or ZnO to enhance charge separation.17–19 Moreover, the surface coating of CCNSs with ZnS was proved to be an extremely effective route to passivate the surface defect states of CCNSs.18 Recently, the oxygen evolution cocatalyst IrOx was added to enhance the hole transfer and reduce the charge recombination.17 Comparison with these successfully designed CCNC-based electrodes,17,18 the IO electrode exhibits even better stability, as summarized in Table 1. Notably, the stability of the treated IOS is even comparable to that of the planar film with a much less surface area and high conductivity, indicating the superior charge separation ability of the IOS.

Moreover, the theoretical hydrogen production versus time can be estimated according to the J–t curve by assuming faradaic efficiency as 100%, while the actual H2 production rate can be directly measured and determined to be 45 μmol h−1 cm−2 by gas chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2d, the theoretical prediction matches the experimental measurements very well, indicating that almost all of the photoelectrons contribute to the reduction of hydrogen.
To understand the origin of the excellent PEC performance, we detected the light absorption and charge separation of the IOS with a thin film as the reference. The diffuse reflection spectra presented in Fig. 3a illustrate that the surface reflectance of the IOS (∼15%) is much lower than that of the thin film (∼25%) in the wavelength range between 350 and 500 nm (the intrinsic absorption of CdS), revealing that the ordered void arrays can suppress surface reflection drastically. Moreover, the IOS exhibits negligible light transmittance (Fig. 3b). As a result, the IOS achieves much higher light absorption than its film counterpart in the whole wavelength range (Fig. 3c and S10†).
 Fig. 3  Optical performance of the IOS and film. (a)–(c) are diffuse reflectance spectra, transmittance spectra, and absorbance spectra of the IOS and film, respectively. (d) and (e) are simulated photon number distributions of the film and IOS, respectively, under TE-polarized illumination at 500 nm. (f) and (g) are enlarged images of the regions labeled in (d) and (e), respectively. 
Finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) simulations were performed to understand the experimental results. Fig. 3d and e show the simulated distribution of absorbed photons in the CdS film and the IOS, respectively, under 500 nm transverse electric (TE)-polarized illumination from the FTO side (see simulation models in Fig. S11†). The numbers of absorbed photons decrease linearly with increasing penetrating depth in both samples; however, the decay rate of the two samples is different. As shown in the enlarged images in Fig. 3f and g, the number of the absorbed photons in the IOS is at least 2 orders of magnitude as large as that in the thin film at the same penetrating depth. Further, simulation on electromagnetic field distribution reveals that the enhancement of light absorption in the IOS mainly arises from the multi-scattering effect (Fig. S12†).
Next, charge separation dynamics in the photoanodes was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 4a shows the Nyquist plots (circle symbols) tested at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under AM 1.5 illumination. The corresponding equivalent circuit model is shown in the inset of Fig. 4a, where Rs represents the resistance of the electrolyte, CPE is the capacitance phase element and Rct is the charge transfer resistance between the photoanode and the electrolyte. By fitting the Nyquist plots with the given model (Fig. 4a, line), the values of Rct in the IOS and film electrodes can be determined to be 760 and 1835 Ω, respectively, indicating that the hole transfer through the solid/liquid interface is more favorable in the IOS electrode. Moreover, the electron lifetime (τn) of the photoanodes can be calculated from the Bode phase plots (Fig. 3b), using the equation,19,35,36 τn = 1/(2πfmax)(1)
 Fig. 4  Charge separation dynamics in the IOS and film photocathodes. (a) is Nyquist plots of the EIS spectra measured at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and the inset is the equivalent circuit. (b) is Bode phase plots. 
As shown in Fig. 4b, the fmax for the IOS is 20 Hz, much smaller than that for the thin film (610 Hz). The calculated electron lifetimes of the IOS and film are 7.9 and 0.26 ms, respectively. A nearly 30-fold enhancement of the electron lifetime of the IOS sample suggests much slower electron–hole recombination occurring in the IOS electrode, indicating a rather advantageous charge separation process arising from the fast hole transfer.
According to the above experimental results, we can distinguish the role of the IOS in each step of the PEC process (light absorption, charge separation, charge transfer and so on), and understand its effect on the final performance. The IPCE value of the photoelectrode can be expressed as,33,34 IPCE = ηabs × APCE = ηabs × ηsep × ηtrans(2)where ηabs, ηsep and ηtrans are the light absorption, charge separation and transfer efficiencies, respectively. Owing to the anti-reflection and multi-scattering effects of the ordered porous structure, the IOS achieves an average light absorption of 1.2 times as high as that of the thin film (between 400 and 500 nm wavelength). On the other hand, the large surface area and thin wall thickness (less than the hole diffusion length) of the IOS lead to fast hole transfer and then a charge separation efficiency of ∼2.4 times as large as that of the film counterpart. The two factors jointly elevate IPCE of the IOS electrode to a value ∼2.9 times (1.2 × 2.4) that of the CdS film, which is almost consistent with the experimental value (∼3). Therefore, the third term, charge transfer efficiency of the IOS, should be same as that of the thin film. This conclusion is supported by similar carrier concentrations in the IOS (2.3 × 1016 cm−3) and thin film (5 × 1016 cm−3). The high carrier concentrations affirm fast electron transfer, leading to a charge transfer efficiency of approximately 100% in both electrodes.
In order to extend the absorption range of the IOS electrode, a CdSe layer with a thickness of about 20 nm was electrodeposited onto the CdS IOS (Fig. S13†). The CdS/CdSe IOS shows enhanced light absorption with an absorption edge at 700 nm (Fig. S14†). Moreover, the stepwise band structure of CdS/CdSe is advantageous for both light generated electrons and holes. As a result, the CdS/CdSe IOS electrode exhibits a high PEC performance with a photocurrent density of 10.5 mA cm−2 and an actual H2 generation rate of 98.2 μmol h−1 cm−2 at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under 1 sun illumination (Fig. 5), these values are among the highest performance achieved by pure cadmium chalcogenide materials in the literature.37–43 However, the PEC stability of this heterogeneous IOS (Fig. S15†) should be further improved.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated that the IOS can overcome the intrinsically slow hole transfer kinetics of the CdS photoanode without compromising light absorption. As a result, the IOS photoanode achieves water splitting efficiency 3.1 times that of the CdS film. Moreover, owing to the fast hole transfer, the IOS photoanode exhibits a high stability, the photocurrent density remains constant during 3 h of continuous illumination. After being coated with a CdSe layer, the CdS/CdSe IOS electrode brings about a photocurrent density as high as 10.5 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. the Ag/AgCl electrode under 1 sun illumination. Quantitative investigation reveals that the IOS achieves charge separation efficiency 2.4 times that of the thin film, light absorption capacity 1.2 times that of the thin film, and charge transfer efficiency the same as that of the thin film. These exciting results suggest that the IOS of CCNCs is promising for efficient and stable visible light water splitting.
