In spite of the introduction of many novel nanomaterials for photothermal therapy, there is still plenty of room for exploration of naïve materials. We have explored the photothermal properties of metal chalcogenides, namely tellurium platinate nanowires (TePt NWrs), in this work. Upon irradiation with a laser (Ti:sapphire laser, 808 nm) the temperature of the aqueous suspension of TePt NWrs was found to increase to ∼62 °C from room temperature at optimum concentrations. This was due to the stability and high photothermal transduction efficiency of nanorods (NRs) i.e. ∼47%. The power to ablate tumor cells was studied using A549 cells and tumor grafted experimental mice models. After an initial exposure for 10 min (808 nm laser at 1 W cm−2), the cells were killed mainly by the process of apoptosis as confirmed by a flow cytometry assisted cell sorting system (FACS; PI-FITC-Annexin V staining). Tumor growth was significantly reduced after photothermal therapy via a combination of TePt NRs and laser, thus proving the importance of this new nanomaterial for cancer photothermal therapy. The current approach has introduced a highly potential photothermal therapy method for applications in the medical world in the near future.
1. Introduction
Due to physico-anatomical alterations of the tumor microenvironment, the entry of drugs and other essential metabolites becomes a difficult task leading to development of drug resistance and other molecular complications in cancer chemotherapy.1 The strategies to enhance the one to one interaction of the chemotherapeutic agents with the target can unravel novel platforms to combat the rapid progression of cancerous cells and metastatic transformations.2 The distortions in tumor anatomy and poor fluid perfusion,3,4 high extracellular matrix densities in the tumor microenvironment,5 severely compromised lymphatic drainage and high interstitial fluid pressure6 and non-specific weak interactions with extracellular components are the most cardinal issues in cancer chemotherapy.
In the past few years, combinatorial therapies have emerged as promising alternatives to existing drug delivery strategies.7 Photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) have been given special consideration to be used as potential therapies for solid tumors.8 These two techniques can be combined with chemotherapy to enhance the permeability and retention of the drugs inside the solid tumors.3 In stark contrast to surgical and radiological techniques, PTT and PDT are minimally invasive techniques which require less expenditure.9,10 PTT, which employs a temperature of above 43 °C, enhances the vascular permeability several fold, thus enabling the interaction of chemotherapeutic agents with the targets. Hyperthermia enhances the blood flow and extravasation of macromolecules. The resulting pressure and cytoskeleton damage lead to cell death.3 PDT is an alternative, which is considered to be safer than PTT in many ways. When the temperature shoots up above 43 °C, many sensitive tissues such as intestinal gut cell lines become damaged leading to some adverse side effects.12 Typically, PDT has the capacity to produce free radicals or other toxic chemical moieties, which kill cancer cells selectively.
Recently, many nanoparticles have been investigated for photothermal killing of cancer cells such as pleomorphic gold NPs,11–14 plasmonic semiconductor NPs,15 DNA anchored NPs,16 platinum NPs,17 and carbon quantum dot modified gold NRs.18 Some recent efforts used metal nano-composites such as CuTe, CuS and CuSe for photothermal ablation of cancer cells.19 The crystalline form of metal chalcogenides, due to their magnificent size dependent properties, has been exploited in a variety of novel applications including surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).20–22 Among transition metal chalcogenides, tellurium based compounds have been widely explored for many novel applications such as solar cells, photovoltaics, optical, thermo-electronics and biological labeling.23–33 One of the finest examples of metal chalcogenides is the TePt-based NPs. They form an excellent combination of metals and semiconductor moieties, making them ideal binary nano-systems34–36 for photothermal therapy of cancer cells. The present protocol for the synthesis of TePt is a slight deviation from the earlier template assisted method used to make 1D TePts.37 We have made an attempt to develop one pot synthesis at 200 °C in the presence of hydrazine, platinum hexachloride (PtCl6) and cetyltriammonium bromide (CTAB) to confer positive charges in order to facilitate their interaction with biological cells.
In the present work, we have tuned the synthesis of TePt NWrs for photothermal therapy. A detailed investigation of the photothermal properties of the proposed NPs along with in vivo studies on experimental mice models is carefully conducted. The photothermal conversion efficiency of TePt NWrs was found to be very high at a particular concentration. In vivo infrared thermal imaging experiments demonstrated the enhancement of temperature above 50 °C using the NIR laser (λ = 808 nm). The mode of killing was confirmed by staining the post irradiated A549 cells with PI-FITC-Annexin V and analyzing using the FACS system.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Hydrazine, PtCl6, CTAB, and tellurium dioxide (TeO2) were purchased from Sigma, USA and used as received without further purification. Lysozyme was purchased from Fluka, UK. A neutral red dye, 2,5-diphenyl-3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiozyl) tetrazolium bromide (MTT), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). A549 cells were purchased from the Bioresource Collection and Research Center (BCRC), Taiwan, and cultured as per the instructions provided by the company. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was purchased from Thermo Scientific, USA (DMEM, HyClone® containing 4 mM l−1 of L-glutamine and 4500 mg l−1 of glucose). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from Gibco, USA. Phosphate buffer saline (PBS), trypsin–EDTA solution (17000 U l−1 trypsin mixed with 0.2 g l−1 EDTA), pen–strep solution (10000 U ml−1 penicillin mixed with 10 mg ml−1 streptomycin) and trypan blue were obtained from Lonza, Belgium.
2.2 Methods

2.2.1 Synthesis of TePt nanoparticles. 
TePt NWrs were synthesized by the modified template-assisted method using CTAB. The tellurium nanowires were synthesized by adding 5 ml of hydrazine to the solution containing 8 mg of TeO2 under mild stirring (1.5–2 h) till the solution turned deep blue to confirm the formation of tellurium nanowires. This solution was centrifuged and dialyzed against pure water for 12 h. This purified precipitate was mixed with a solution containing 10 mM CTAB and allowed to disperse for 20 min. Next, 1.5 ml of 10 mM PtCl6 was added to this solution under stirring and sealed in a Teflon coated container. The container was kept at 100 °C for 12 h to synthesize TePt NWrs. A maximum amount of CTAB was removed by washing the mixture with water followed by dialysis against distilled water for 24 h.


2.2.2 Characterization. 
The morphological details of TePt NWrs were elucidated using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Philips, The Netherlands). UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy (Thermo Evolution 201, USA) was carried out using a standard quartz cuvette having a path length of 1 cm. 2 μl of the samples were drop coated on Formwar coated copper grids to form a uniform layer and dried at ambient temperature to ensure the integrity of the film. Crystallographic details of NPs were obtained using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Phillips, The Netherlands).


2.2.3 
            In vitro photothermal efficiency of TePt NWrs. 
In order to check the photothermal performance of TePt NWrs, different amounts of TePt NWrs ranging from 1–10 μg ml−1 (0.5 ml total volume) were taken in a mini-quartz cuvette and irradiated with an 808 nm laser for 10 min. The power density of the laser was adjusted to 1 W cm−2. The enhancement in the temperature was recorded using a thermal imaging camera (FLIR E8, Sweden). In order to scrutinize the photo-stability of TePt NWrs, ten micrograms of the aqueous suspension of NPs were irradiated with the laser for 10 min (ON) followed by natural cooling of the nanoparticle suspension after switching off the laser (OFF). This ON–OFF cycle was repeated 10 times in order to validate the claim.


2.2.4 Routine maintenance of the cell line and cytotoxicity of NPs. 
Lung carcinoma (A549) cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 104 cells per well in a 96 well-plate cultured in DMEM medium (8.5% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% penicillin–streptomycin mixture) under the standard conditions of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For evaluating cytotoxicity, MTT-based assay was done as per previous studies and cytotoxicity was measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm after 24 h. In another approach, trypan blue dye-exclusion assay was used to analyse cell viability. Controls used were only cells and untreated cells with laser alone. A similar procedure was repeated after irradiation of A549 cells treated with TePt NWrs at different concentrations with the laser as presented in Fig. 4.


2.2.5 
            In vivo photothermal studies. 
Healthy ICR mice (Lasco, Charles River Technology, Taiwan) weighing 18–20 g were used for comprehending the photothermal ability of the NPs in the tumor microenvironment. The experimental protocol is approved by NSYSU, Animal Care and Use Committee, 2015–2016. The animals were handled as per the ethical guidelines provided by the above committee. Induction of tumor in mice was done as per the previous methods. Briefly, A549 cells (300 μl of 2 × 108 cells per ml in Hanks balanced salt solution) were injected in the right flank of the mice. The mice were considered for experimentation after the growth of the tumors was ensured to be 100–150 mm in diameter. The mice were anaesthetized using standard procedures. In order to check the in vivo photothermal properties of TePt NWrs, nearly 100 μl of purified TePt NWrs in PBS was injected intra-tumorally using a hypodermic needle. The control mice were injected with PBS alone. TePt NWrs were allowed to disperse inside the tumor for nearly 1.5 h. The tumor surface was irradiated with the laser for 10 min. The increase in the temperature was recorded using a thermal imaging camera (FLIR, Sweden). To assess the post-irradiation internal anatomy tumor, the mice were euthanized and the tumor was removed to make a wax embedded cake of the treated tumor. Thin sections were made using microtomy and stained using hematoxylin/eosin (H&E). The slices were observed under an inverted microscope. The volume of the post-treated tumors was calculated (with respect to control) using the following equation: (1)


2.2.6 Analysis of cell death after photothermal therapy. 
Post laser irradiated A549 cells in the presence of TePt NWrs were stained with FITC-Annexin V and PI to understand the mode of killing. The staining was done as per the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Strong Biotech Corporation, Taiwan). In short, actively growing A549 cells (∼107 cells per ml) were treated with laser in the presence of NPs. For the FACS analysis, cells stained with 2 μl of FITC-Annexin V and PI were mixed with 100 μl of the binding buffer and incubated in the dark for 20 min. The samples were analysed using a flow cytometer (CyflowSL, Partec Germany) equipped with a 488 nm solid-state laser.

3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the schematic representation of the synthesis process. Tellurium NWrs were synthesized in the presence of hydrazine, which was further allowed to react with platinum ions in the presence of CTAB to yield TePt NWrs. The concentration of CTAB was adjusted to be above critical micelle concentration. As per some earlier theories about the intricate relationship between the shape and photothermal properties of nanomaterials, the hyper-branched and spiny structures are most suitable for photo-thermal killing of cancer cells (Liu et al. 201438).

Fig. 2a shows the TEM of TePt NWrs synthesized using hydrazine. The size of TePt NWrs was found to be ∼10 μm. After irradiation with the laser, TePt NWrs got transformed into TePt nanostars ranging from 20–30 nm in size (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2c and d show DLS analysis with a zeta value more stable before laser irradiation (−45 ± 5 mV) and less stable after irradiation (−14 ± 3 mV). The apparent aggregation might be due to this low zeta value at pH 7.0. In addition, the resulting shape may be due to the templating action of CTAB during the reaction of Te and Pt at high temperature. In order to accelerate the circulation of NPs in the bloodstream, their size must be in the range of 50 nm to avoid the clearance by reticulo-endothelial systems such as liver, spleen and kidneys.39 Another important feature of the TePt NWrs was found to be their high crystallinity as shown in the SAED pattern (Fig. 2e). Crystalline materials were found to have very high thermal conductivity, an important asset for agents used in PTT.40 X-ray diffraction (Fig. 2f) of TePt NWrs was performed based on the data from the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards and previous findings by other researchers.37 As per the given standards in terms of peaks, TePt was found to have a rhombohedral phase of Pt3Te4. The elemental composition in the form of EDAX of TePt is presented in Fig. 2g. It shows the presence of both the elements having a Pt:Te ratio of approximately 3:4.36, which corresponds to Pt3Te4, thus confirming the results of XRD. The advantage of Pt3Te4 over other phases of Te and Pt chalcogenides (TePt, TePt2, and Pt2Te3) is its exceptional thermodynamic stability, which can be exploited in the present context for photothermal stability under physiological conditions. Pt3Te4 is formed from Pt2Te3 during the temperature-induced transformation of the latter.

Fig. 3a displays the UV-Vis-NIR spectra of tellurium nanowires and their final growth to TePt NWrs. Tellurium nanowires exhibited signature absorbance at around 680 nm due to the electronic transition from the P-lone pair valence bond to the P-anti-bonding conduction band and the semiconducting nature of tellurium.41–43 After reaction with a platinum salt, there were two cardinal observations, first, the signature absorbance of tellurium nanowires vanished and second, the absorbance of TePt NWrs was enhanced to a great extent. This optical change in the structure is in favor of photothermal energy since it will enhance the photothermal efficiency of the nano-conjugate. The absorbance of TePt NWrs in the NIR regime (1000 nm and above) is helpful in one of the most potential cancer therapies called photothermal therapy. This region is considered to be the most significant for biological applications due to its high penetrability inside the body as well as least absorption by blood and other biological fluids.38

Scale bar represents 100 μm. 
The enhancement in temperature with respect to time is shown in Fig. 3b. After irradiation with the laser (NdYAG, 808 nm, 1 W cm−2), for 10–12 min, TePt NWrs exhibited high temperature enhancement capacity. The temperature of TePt NWrs was found to increase to 60 ± 2 °C from room temperature, with a total increment of ∼35 °C. The temperature of the phosphate buffered saline as control was found to enhance to 34 °C.
In order to tune the optimum amount of TePt NWrs for temperature enhancement, different amounts of TePt NWrs (1–10 μg ml−1) were taken in PBS and irradiated with the laser for 15 min (Fig. 2c). After careful scrutiny, 10 μg ml−1 aqueous suspension of TePt NWrs was found to have a maximum influence on the enhancement of temperature with respect to control, as shown in Fig. 3b and c. After exposure to the laser (1 W cm−2), the temperature increased to 60 °C as shown in Fig. 3c.
In order to assess the thermal stability of the TePt NWrs, nearly 10 μg ml−1 of the sample was taken in a micro-cuvette and irradiated with the NdYAG laser for 200 seconds and allowed to cool for the same time. The process was repeated 10 times and represented graphically (Fig. 3d). The heating and cooling profile of TePt NWrs was found to be uniform throughout the cycle thus proving their relevance for photothermal therapy. This is an important attribute of the nanoparticle, which is appreciated as an ideal candidate for photothermal therapy, having the capacity to withstand the exposure to intense laser. The power of the laser was adjusted to 1 ± 0.5 W cm−2 and the exposure area was adjusted to 3–4 mm to reduce the unwanted exhaustion of the laser power. In a variety of photothermal therapies, the power of the laser was adjusted to >10 W cm−2 to achieve a sufficiently high killing rate of the cancer cells.39 The lacunae of such high laser intensity are due to the destruction of the normal tissue of the cells such as intestinal linings as it is far beyond the recommended intensity of exposure for human skin (0.35 ± 2 W cm−2).
Photothermal transduction efficiencies (PTEs) of TePt NWrs were calculated using methods described elsewhere (Liu et al. 201438). The following equation was used to calculate the PTE of the NPs: (2)where hs is the product of the heat transfer coefficient and the surface area of the cuvette, Tmax − Tout is the difference between the heat of the system and the surrounding after exposure to 10 μg ml−1 of TePt NWrs for 10 min, A808nm is the intensity of absorption at 808 nm and Qin,out is the dissipation of the heat by the solvent and the container. The PTE was found to be 42.7%, which is much higher than many nano-composites such as gold NRs (22 ± 1%, 808 nm laser), CuSe (22%, 980 nm laser), and CuS (25.7%, 980 nm laser)44 (Li et al. 2014).
The comprehension of biocompatibility of NPs under biological conditions becomes mandatory in order to prove the efficacy of the proposed cancer therapy. The toxicity of the TePt NWrs was assessed on A549 cells using trypan blue and MTT assay with and without exposure to the laser (Fig. 4a and b). There was substantial depletion of cell survival after exposure to the laser (808 nm, 0.1 W cm−2) for 300 s (total energy 30 Joules). At optimum concentration of TePt NWrs (10 μg ml−1), the survival of the cells was found to be nearly 25% in comparison with ∼68% without exposure to the laser for 5 min as depicted in Fig. 4a and b. At higher concentration, up to 20 μg ml−1, the viability drops down to 9% and 5% as determined by the trypan blue and MTT assay, showing almost complete abrogation of cancer cells. The lower panel of Fig. 4 displays the viability of A549 cells using trypan blue (0.4%, pH 7.0). Live and dead cells were determined on the basis of the color of the cells after incubation with trypan blue for 5–7 min. As shown in Fig. 4c, the impact of the concentration of TePt NWrs was found to be significant. With respect to control (not exposed to laser light), the percentage of cell death was found to increase proportionately with the concentration of TePt NWrs. The number of blue cells (dead cells due to the uptake of the dye) was found to increase with respect to concentration, thus explaining the inimical effect of the laser induced heat on the A549 cells.

Fig. 5 shows the impact of laser irradiation on the temperature enhancement of tumor after injection of TePt NWrs in the tumorous regime. The temperature of the tumor was found to be enhanced from 37 °C to 63.6 °C after exposure to the laser for 10 min. This in vivo analysis of hyperthermia proves the efficacy of the NPs in the photothermal therapy of cancer.
 Fig. 5  The enhancement in the tumor temperature upon irradiation with the laser with respect to time (labels (a–f): 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 min, respectively). The images were taken using an FLIR thermal imaging camera. 
The white light image of mice bearing the tumor is shown in Fig. 6. During the treatment, the tumor size with respect to time was also studied and the result is graphically expressed in Fig. 6. After the initial treatment of 18 days in the presence of TePt NWrs as shown in Fig. 6a (upper panel), the tumor volume was reduced from 200 mm3 to ∼95 mm3. This explains the efficacy of the proposed NPs for cancer therapy. The graphical representation of changes in tumor volume with respect to the time of treatment is presented in Fig. 6b. These results are also compared with control using saline injection into the mice for a similar tenure as shown in Fig. 6a. The tumor volume (in the case of control) was increased to a great extent.

(a) tumor images of TePt NWrs injected at the pre-laser stage, followed by irradiation (0.5 W cm−2, 10 min) and the intermediate stage after 10 days and the post-laser stage after 18 days showing complete destruction of tumour (black burn marks could be seen due to the laser). (b) Tumor volume changes with respect to time upon nanoparticle treatment and laser irradiation. Saline was used as positive control and was not irradiated. Data are represented as mean ± standard deviation (n = 5). 
In order to check the microanatomy of the tumor after photothermal therapy, the thin slices of tumor obtained by a wax embedding technique were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining and observed under a light microscope (Fig. 7). With respect to control (untreated tumors), there was significant damage observed after increasing the time of exposure laser from 3 min to 9 min. The mode of cancer cell ablation by TePt NWrs is demonstrated by staining the treated cells with the PI–Annexin V–FITC conjugate using a FACS (Fig. 8). The results were interpreted with respect to control cells (Fig. 8a, without any treatment). The cells were found to be healthy (∼99% survival). After treatment with 10 μg ml−1 TePt NWrs (Fig. 8b), the cells were found to be killed mainly by the process of necrosis (PI +ve, Q1). Only 21.24% cells were found to undergo necrosis in the above case. This explains the biocompatibility of the NPs under physiological milieu.

The impact of laser (Fig. 8c, 808 nm, 1 W cm−2) was found to be negligible on the cells. Cells were found to be killed by the process of apoptosis (Annexin-FITC +ve, Q4) and necrosis. Fig. 8d displays the effect of laser in the presence of TePt NWrs. The mode of cell death was confirmed to be mainly by apoptosis. ∼84% of the cells were found to be ablated by the process of apoptosis, thus verifying the mode of cell death.
4. Conclusions
A platinum chalcogenide, namely tellurium platinate (Pt3Te4), was found to be exceptionally important for photothermal therapy of cancer cells, mainly due to the semiconducting properties of tellurium. The high photothermal conversion efficiency of the nano-conjugate catalyzed the enhancement of temperature by ∼35 °C from room temperature. The tumor size was found to decrease with respect to time after exposure to the laser in the presence of nano-conjugates. Alteration in the internal anatomy was studied by H&E staining of thin slices made by microtomy. In sum, the impact of photothermal properties was found to be pivotal in in vitro as well as in vivo studies.

 	Fig. 5  The enhancement in the tumor temperature upon irradiation with the laser with respect to time (labels (a–f): 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 min, respectively). The images were taken using an FLIR thermal imaging camera.	 

 	Fig. 6  Anti-tumor photothermal activity of TePt NWrs on tumors. (a) tumor images of TePt NWrs injected at the pre-laser stage, followed by irradiation (0.5 W cm−2, 10 min) and the intermediate stage after 10 days and the post-laser stage after 18 days showing complete destruction of tumour (black burn marks could be seen due to the laser). (b) Tumor volume changes with respect to time upon nanoparticle treatment and laser irradiation. Saline was used as positive control and was not irradiated. Data are represented as mean ± standard deviation (n = 5).	 

 	Fig. 7  H&E staining of tissue sections of tumors before (a) and after exposure to the laser for (b) 3 (c) 6 and (d) 6 min.	 

 	Fig. 8  The modus operandi of photothermal killing of TePt NWrs via apoptosis determined by FACS using PI-FITC-Annexin V staining of (a) A549 cells as a control (b) cells incubated with 10μg ml−1 TePt NWrs without exposure to the laser, and (c) cells exposed to the 808 nm laser in the absence of the NPs and (d) cells with TePt exposed to the laser.
