    , Accepted 25th May 2017First published on 25th May 2017AbstractWe present the electronic, magnetic, thermoelectric and optical properties of ferromagnetic metal nanowires (NWs) made of iron (Fe) and cobalt (Co) atoms using a first principles approach. Each property has been investigated as a function of atomic arrangement and nanowire diameter. Magnetic anisotropy is predicted originating from the spin–orbit coupling. Significant delocalization of electronic charge density is found in Fe nanowires with the increase in nanowire diameter, while the charge distribution anisotropy manifests in all the studied nanowire configurations. The thermoelectric properties exhibit strong coupling to the nanowire configuration and diameter. Thermal conductivity shows large divergence from the bulk iron and cobalt. The optical properties show the strongest increase for nanowires with large diameters. The theoretical modeling of configuration- and diameter-dependent nanowire properties serves as a cornerstone for future utilization of nanowire films in a variety of applications.
1. Introduction
Metallic nanowires (NWs) have attracted much attention because of potential technological applications of their physical and chemical properties, and as plasmonic building blocks because of their prosperous implementation as waveguides,1–3 routers and electronic gates,4–6 and in the development of nanoelectronic devices.7 Size- and structure-dependent physical properties play an important role at the nano-scale.7 Direct visualization8 of metallic NWs has been investigated by using a scanning aperture probe9 and electrical detection.10 In NWs, the ratio of electronically and coordinately unsaturated surface atoms to internal atoms is increased compared to their bulk and surface counterparts, resulting in higher reactivity. Because of this, the catalytic properties of the nanostructures are more advanced than those of the bulk materials. Various techniques have been used to synthesize long and regular nanowires with larger surface area.11 It is very useful, therefore, to analyze the influence of dimensionality on these properties.12 In principle, these properties can be obtained from density functional (DFT) calculations. However, the computation time and storage data increase drastically with the number of atoms. Thus, there is an essential need for simplified methods that depend on the quantum mechanics, while still capturing the essential physics. Lee et al. discussed many forms according to different applications: metallic, semiconductor, insulating, and organic compounds are being used for electronics, energy conversion, chemical sensing, and optical applications among other fields.7,13 In addition, Zhang et al. studied the surface transformation of the cobalt (0001) surface induced by an over layer of adsorbed carbon atoms, which can dissociate adsorbed CO with a low activation energy barrier.14 Because of the promising properties of the nanowires, they could be used as active components or interconnects in fabricating many types of nano-scaled electronics, optics, optoelectronics, electrochemical, and electromechanical devices,15,16 such as photo detectors,17 single-electron transistors,18,19 electron emitters, field effect transistors,20 light-emitting diodes, biochemical sensors21 and ultraviolet nano-lasers.22
Ferromagnetic NWs and nanoparticle arrays are becoming an approachable concept because of their novel magnetic and transport properties at the scale of few to tens of nanometers.23 In terms of applications, they are the most important nanostructures to have been synthesized and characterized in recent years. This comes due to their worthy ascension in physical, chemical, and mechanical properties: enhanced mechanical flexibility compared with their bulk counterparts and single-crystalline, no grain boundary form, resulting in direct conduction paths and, thus, great potential and energy harvesting applications in nano-devices. One of the initial NW properties, Young's modulus, decreases with their fracture strength, while at the same time it increases as the nanowire diameter decreases.24 Due to the large surface to volume ratio of nanostructured materials, they have benefits for the unique possibility of enhancing sensitivity and selectivity.25 NWs have a very large surface-area/volume ratio as compared with their bulk counterparts, and their structures and properties can be quite different from those of bulk materials because of unique properties at the nano-scale.26 In particular, NWs as one-dimensional nanostructure are preferable for providing a direct path for electrical transport. Experiments prove that electron transport can be up to two orders of magnitude faster in nanowire-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) than in nanoparticle DSSCs.27–29
Recent issues regard the future and availability of rare-earth element NWs, which are demanded for high performance permanent magnets that have been applied to a large extent in renewable energy and clean energy applications.30,31 The rare-earth compounds have some disadvantages as permanent magnets: relatively low magnetization and limited thermodynamical stability, when compared to ferromagnetic 3d transition metals, like Fe, Co, and their alloys.32 On top of that, the 3d elements and their alloys are cost effective and easily available in large quantities compared with rare-earth elements, which are studied as “soft magnetic materials,” because of their high saturation magnetization, high Curie temperatures and low coercivity.33 Co-NWs have even been proposed as an e-skin high-stretchability/high-sensitivity nano-sensors for applications in bio monitoring, prosthetics and sporting.34
As the NW diameter is, inevitably, one of the key factors that affects the nanowires properties, we have, in this paper, studied a successive evolution of various properties of Fe and Co with three different geometry configurations and different diameters: from LCs and ZZ to 2 × 2 NWs. Fe and Co atoms are chosen because they are the preliminary ferromagnetic materials belonging to the 3d transition metals (TMs) group. We show that these materials are promising magnetic materials for their magneto crystalline anisotropy (MAE) and spin magnetic moment. Besides, we have also investigated electronic, optical and transport properties of ferromagnetic materials Fe and Co with diameters up to 1.26 nm and 2.0 nm, respectively. The paper is organized as follows: the methodology is reported in Section 2, the structural properties are discussed in Section 3, and the study of the electronic properties is reported in Section 4, transport and optical properties are discussed in Sections 5 and 6 and the conclusion is given in Section 7.
2. Methodology
We consider ferromagnetic NWs consisting of Fe or Co atoms. Periodicity is imposed without interaction in replicating directions and is translationally irreversible. We consider three nanowire configurations with different atomic arrangements and diameters (1R, 2R and 3R): (i) linear chain (LC), i.e. infinite 1D chain of atoms, (ii) zigzag (ZZ) and (iii) 2 × 2 NW35 (Fig. 1). The nanowires are built along the [001] direction (z axis) by a periodic repetition of a supercell made up of (001) planes (monatomic wire), whereas all the 2R and 3R structures consist of alternate stacking of (110) atomic planes of FCC Fe or Co, where two atoms are taken to each plane so as to build the NW along the 〈110〉 direction (dumb-bell NW). We use density functional theory (DFT) electronic structure calculations in our calculations and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) as described by PBE for the exchange–correlation effects36 together with the inclusion of spin–orbit coupling (SOC). We investigate both the spin-polarized and spin-compensated cases in order to find the lowest energy state. We use the methodology as implemented in the Quantum Espresso37 code with the ultrasoft scalar-relativistic Vanderbilt pseudopotentials.38,39
 Fig. 1  Side (red atoms) and top (green atoms) views of the structure of (i) LC, (ii) ZZ, and (iii) 2 × 2 NWs with different diameters: (a) 1R, (b) 2R, and (c) 3R. LC and ZZ NWs in the 1R case do not have a diameter. 
The NWs are a replication along the z-axis and are built into tetragonal supercells. In the study of linear chains, the inter-chain distance of 18 Å is sufficient to eliminate the interaction between the NW and its periodic replicate. Modelling of the ZZ and 2 × 2 NW chains is carried out in a supercell with the lattice constant of 18 Å perpendicular to the chain axis. The parameter ‘‘h” (unit cell height) is varied with respect to the cohesive energy, along with atomic relaxation, in order to obtain the equilibrium height ‘‘heq.” We employed the Methfessel–Paxton smearing method and the energy convergence was set to 10−6 eV. The cut-off energy of the plane-wave expansion was 500 eV and the k-point mesh was chosen to be 1 × 1 × 50 for LC, 1 × 1 × 100 for ZZ NWs, and 3 × 3 × 60 for 2 × 2 NWs. All the structural relaxations were performed using the conjugate gradient method. The magneto crystalline anisotropy (MAE) has been calculated as the total energy difference for two different perpendicular directions of magnetization; it is a small, but important quantity that requires a very high numerical accuracy. It can be found by using theta and phi as angle 1 (i.e. in the plane) and angle 2 (i.e. out of the plane). However, we use the same k point meshes and energy convergence as described previously, which proved to be sufficient. Transport properties were evaluated by using the BoltzTrap40 code, which calculates the thermodynamical properties in the quasi-harmonic approximation. It is based on a smoothed Fourier interpolation of the bands. From the analytical representation, we calculate the derivatives necessary for the transport distributions. Our focus is also directed on the complex dielectric function, as reflectivity and absorption coefficient have been calculated using with random phase approximation (RPA).41
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural properties

Table 1 mentions the calculated values of various properties such as cohesive energy Ec, magnetic moment μB, lattice constant (Lc) and anisotropy E1 and E2 for both NWs. The height parameter between two nearby atoms is responsible for the variations in cohesive energy. The lattice constant shows good agreement with previous reported work:42–47 2.15 Å (2.0 Å) (Fe LC-1R),42–44 2.25 Å (2.40 Å) (Co LC-1R),45 2.30 Å46 and 2.50 Å.47 We also note that cohesive energy Ec continuously increases for the Co-ZZ and 2 × 2 configuration and decreases for the Co-LC configuration along with different diameters. For the cohesive energy for each atom of the material, we are generally using the following equations: Ecohesive = (Ecomplex − nEatoms)/n.(1)Here, Ecohesive is the cohesive energy, Ecomplex and Eatoms are the energy of the complex system and the atoms, and n is the number of atoms.

We show that for (001) packing, , whereas for (110) packing, , dy = a, where a is the lattice constant of the three-dimensional lattice, dx is atomic separation along the x-direction, and dy is separation along the y-direction for all NWs. Hence, the (001) packing ends in a symmetric structure with dx = dy, whereas (110) packing having dy > dx or  corresponds to a structure with reduced symmetry.30 Investigation of the relaxed geometry and dimensions of adjacent dimmers in 2 × 2 NWs demonstrates the stability of starting FCC (110) stacking, so it is used for building the starting structure. The study of the relaxed geometry and configuration of 2 × 2 NWs indicates that the maximum stability corresponds to the starting FCC (110) packing, whereas the metastable maximum corresponds to the stacking of the FCC (001) plane. Nakanishi et al. studied the building of the starting structure, in which (110) planes play an important role for the stacking of (001) FCC planes for Fe 2 × 2 NWs.48
The spin magnetic momenta per atom (μ) are 2.0046 and 2.7749 for Fe/Co-bulk using SOC, and in the case of Fe-LC-1R and Co-LC-1R, they are 3.16 μB and 2.15 μB (SOC), while 3.36 μB,39 1.67 μB50 and 1.57 μB51 are previously reported values (PBE). The larger value of nearest neighbor distance (dnn) may be responsible for the larger value of magnetic moment.52 The value of μB for different Fe-1R configurations decreases from LC to 2 × 2 NW configurations or with interatomic separation heq (equilibrium height), while the cohesive energy of the Co NWs increases with the change of the structure configurations and diameter of the respective NWs, except in the case of the LC configuration (Fig. 2).

Generally, the total energy of a one-dimensional wire as a function of magnetization direction can be written as E = E0 + sin2θ(E1 − E2cos2φ),(2)where θ is the polar angle of the magnetization corresponding to the z-axis and φ is the azimuthal angle in the x–y plane. Hence, E0 denotes the total energy when the magnetization is along the z-axis (θ = 0°,φ = 0°). E1 is the axial anisotropy constant and is obtained as the difference in total energy for magnetization along the y-axis (θ = 90°,φ = 90°) and z-axis, i.e., E1 = Ey − Ez or in terms of cohesive energy Ec, E1 = Ezc − Eyc. E2 is the azimuthal anisotropy constant and is the total energy difference for magnetization along the y-axis and the x-axis (θ = 90°,φ = 0°), i.e. E2 = Ey − Ex = Exc − Eyc. The value of anisotropy E1 is less than the value of azimuthal E2, hence azimuthal E2 would decide the easy and hard axis.
3.2. Electronic properties
In order to understand the critical contribution of the d-orbitals of the electronic states, we carried out calculations of the projected total density of state (PDOS) for the three configurations with different diameters (Fig. 3 and 4). Clearly, spin–orbit coupling (SOC) plays an important role (compare with ESI,† Fig. S1, which shows the band structures without the SOC included). This role gains importance as one goes to more complex NW systems (LC → ZZ → 2 × 2). It is also responsible for the magnetic anisotropy predicted in the previous section. The spin up and spin down channels are asymmetric and with zero band gaps, retaining the basic property of the bulk counterparts. The top of the valence band maximum (VBM) and the bottom of the conduction band minimum (CBM) are both crossing the Fermi level. This gives a rich Fermi surface, which can open a pathway to a multitude of electronic phenomena, discoverable by additional complementary experimental studies based on techniques like angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The number of bands crossing the Fermi level increases drastically with structure complexion of the NWs (LC → ZZ → 2 × 2) and with the increase of the diameter. This effect is most profound in the 2 × 2 NW where the structural complexity allows the largest increase of the number of atoms with NW radius. To illustrate this, we calculated the electron charge densities (Fig. 5). While the LC and ZZ type NWs preserve the charge distribution as the NW diameter increases, in the 2 × 2 NW very localized electron states at lower diameters exhibit significant delocalization at 3R diameter. The reason behind this is that in the 2 × 2 NW a transition from 2R to 3R diameter presents the largest structural change. Consequently, electron delocalization serves as a stabilizing force which smears the energy over a larger volume. This effect is not seen in Co 2 × 2 NWs, as the density of the electronic states lies already energetically deep enough to secure the stable system. This, in turn, originates from the two fully occupied d-orbitals, compared to only one in Fe, leaving only three d-electrons for delocalized bonding with the neighboring atoms, compared to four in Fe. Conversely, distortions of the Peierls type might cause band gap opening through a metal to semiconductor/insulator transition. LC-1R NWs would be most susceptible to these, as they are closest to a real 1D system, while in ZZ and 2 × 2 NWs, there are other effects, such as the surface effects, which would suppress a distortion of this type.

The projected density of states (PDOS) describes the origin of the metallic behavior of all the NW geometries (Fig. 3 and 4). The spin-up and spin-down states determining the ferromagnetic metallicity originate from the 3d orbitals. These surface conductive states retain the metallic character of the studied NW even for larger radii and, thus, have a different role than the one of surface states in Si NWs, which open up a band gap with increasing NW radius,53 although they are (theoretically) grown to a lesser extent. This is supported by the reasoning that as the NW size increases so does the dominant influence of the facet atoms, which pertain the metallicity. Such stability of Fe and Co NWs' metallic character with respect to the variations in the NW diameter and its independence of the NW structure at the nano-scale is an advantage which could be exploited in conductive interconnects used in nano-devices employed in photovoltaic modules or FETs (field effect transistors).54,55 It should be mentioned that the decomposition into projected DOS is model dependent and is affected by the choice of the sphere radii. The states having high weight at the molecular site are situated at low energies for the up spin. Thus, the valence band is dominated by the spin up states – they rarely cross the Fermi level, while the conduction band is dominated by the spin down states, which always cross the Fermi level, so the studied NWs may behave like semi-metallic ferromagnetic materials (see ESI,† for further details).
Another interesting observed feature is the anisotropy of the electronic charge density for 2 × 2 NWs. The contour plots show partial ionic and strong covalent bonding between nearby atoms depending on the Pauling electro-negativity difference of Fe (1.83) and Co (1.88). The bonding has a significant covalent character due to the sharing of charge with almost the same degree of charge transfer for all the studied diameters and all three NW configurations. This is due to the strong hybridization of the covalent Fe–Fe and Co–Co bonds. Here, for ZZ NW configured as two LC NWs placed side by side for 1R, but arranged at the h/2 scale corresponding to the z-axis, we also observe the conduction channel that exists along the individual LC NWs. The interaction between these two LC NWs shows ionic bonding or very weak interaction. In the case of 2 × 2 NWs, the conduction channels exist in the individual dimmers along the z-axis, as said above. Due to the one-dimensional configuration of the NW, it brings the anisotropic behavior in their region compared to other systems. This suggests that the bonding is more of a metallic than of a covalent kind.
3.3. Thermoelectric properties
Two main factors governing the thermal transport in nanowires are the structural and phonon scattering, which depend on many factors such as molecular structure, phase changes, grain size, and mainly temperature, compositions of chemicals and pressure. The lattice imperfections, like defects and impurities, are not regarded in our simulations. Since the largest simulated NW (3R < 1 nm) still has a diameter much smaller than the mean free path of either iron (dmfp = 10.9 nm) or cobalt (dmfp = 14.0 nm),56 various scattering mechanisms will govern the transport of charge carriers (electrons/holes) and phonons: structural scattering, like surface scattering, which will be dominant for R < dmfp, or grain boundary scattering, and scattering due to the electron–phonon coupling, existing in the bulk counterparts. Structural confinement represents an upper boundary on the mean free path, basically lowering the thermal conductivity: κNWFe ≤ 40 W m−1 K−1, κbulkFe ≈ 80 W m−1 K−1; κNWCo ≤ 50 W m−1 K−1, κbulkCo ≈ 100 W m−1 K−1. As expected from the structural differences of LC, ZZ, and 2 × 2 NWs (Fig. 1), diverse behavior of the thermal (κ) and electrical (σ) conductivity occurs as a function of NW diameter and temperature (Fig. 6). We will see that the specific arrangement of atoms in the studied NWs has a profound effect on the conductivities. The discussed parameters such as thermal (κ) and electrical (σ) conductivity are obtained from the BoltzTrap40 code, where data is taken near the Fermi energy and shown in Fig. 6. The Lorentz (L) number is equal to (3)where κ and σ are the thermal and electrical conductivity and T is temperature. The electronic part of the thermal conductivity is calculated at zero electric current. This can be defined as κelij = κ0ij −Tνiα(σ−1)βανβj(4)where κ0ij is the electronic part of the thermal conductivity and the second part of the equation is directly related to the power factor.
 Fig. 6  Thermal and electrical conductivity and Lorentz coefficient of LC, ZZ, and 2 × 2 NWs as diameter functions of Fe and Co NWs. The particular symbol and colors describe different configurations. 
Besides the charge carrier mobility, impeded by the narrowing of the NW cross sections by decreased diameters, the thermal and electrical conductivities will depend on the arrangement of atoms inside the studied NW configurations. While the LC and ZZ configurations have a rather smooth outer surface, the 2 × 2 configuration presents a much rougher surface observed as a buckling of the surface plane. As the simulated NWs have principally infinite aspect ratio (height/thickness), surface roughness scattering is dominated by the confinement along the shorter direction (NW diameter). The expected scattering cross section from the buckled surface will, thus, be larger, contributing to the decrease of conductivities. Temperature dependence can be easily understood in the low temperature limit: as the temperature decreases, short-wave phonon modes freeze out, effectively diminishing the phonon scattering. However, the structural scattering remains, having now a predominant effect. Electron heat capacity decreases, inducing a decrease in the thermal conductivity.
The thermal conductivity κ of all the compounds below 800 K is attributable to phonons. The NWs have a thermal conductivity that behaves like a typical crystalline metal, with a maximum T = 800 K.
High atomic mass will also reduce the atomic vibration frequency and the lattice thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity is generally expected to be higher for lighter anion elements such as oxygen.57 In terms of dopability, the band gaps increase from the tellurides to the oxides, and the expected dopability should decrease on average.58 Therefore, moving from tellurides to oxides (i.e., going to lighter anions) could be detrimental on three accounts: thermal conductivity, dopability, and maximum achievable power factor (based on band structure characteristics that are independent of doping). These three factors combined make it very challenging to develop high-performance oxide thermoelectrics. It has been discovered that ultrathin NWs have good thermoelectric properties.59,60 With increase in temperature both transfer of free electrons and lattice vibrations increase, and due to this the thermal conductivity also increases. The Fe-ZZ and Co-2 × 2 NWs react more with increasing diameter, which corresponds to the temperature increases due to their special atomic arrangement for both cases. A major difference in thermal conductivity has been observed between Fe-ZZ and Co-2 × 2 NWs configurations for different diameters.
To estimate the performance of thermoelectric materials a figure-of-merit can be determined, ZT = S2σ/κ, which requires a low thermal conductivity κ and a high electrical conductivity σ to obtain enhanced energy conversion directly related to the efficiency of a device. For low dimensional structures, such as thin films (two dimensions) or nanowires (one dimension), an extraordinary improvement of the figure of merit could be observed. This impact dependent on the quantum confinement of the electronic states gives a method for increasing one of the classically inter-related parameters without influencing the others.61 As mentioned above, we calculated thermal conductivity for different NWs where their small size and high electrical conductivity compared to Fe30Co61Cu9/Cu multilayer nanowires (MNW) or Co3FeNx (nanoparticle-stacked porous nanowires)62,63 make them very attractive for applications in nano-electronics and optoelectronics.64,65 The electrical conductivity of NWs, as in most other materials, depends on temperature. At higher temperatures, the electrical conductivity slightly decreases for the case of Fe LC-1R–2R, 2 × 2-1R–2R NWs and 1R of ZZ and LC for Co NWs. However, this can be decoupled from the NW diameter, to find that a larger surface area yields a greater degree of change in the electrical conductivity. Thus, it increases with increasing NW diameter. To state it more clearly, for the same volume of material, a larger NW diameter increases the electrical conductivity, and a smaller diameter decreases electrical conductivity. Only in a few cases, such as Fe-2 × 2 and Co-ZZ with varying NW diameters, the electrical conductivity slightly decreases as a function of temperature. Therefore, it is apparent that the diameter is a crucial parameter. For this diagram, the small diameter NWs are active enough compared to large diameter NWs and also have larger thermal and electrical conductivities, although not maintaining the same total volume of NWs for each of the different nanowire diameters.
3.4. Optical properties
The optical properties are directly related to the electronic properties of the materials. For example, in materials with a direct band gap, optical transitions are much stronger while in indirect gap materials, the transition should involve a phonon to conserve the momentum. An indirect gap decreases the transition rate of excited electrons from valence band maxima (VBM) to conduction band minima (CBM) by absorption of photons of angular frequency, ω. The major optical characteristic in the solids is associated with its complex dielectric function ε(ω): ε(ω) = ε1 + iε2,(5)where ε1 and iε2 are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function respectively.
The dispersion of optical permittivity was examined from the energy eigenvalues and electron wave functions or on the basis of electronic structure. Since all NWs are crystallized in the tetragonal structure, following this symmetry one can observe along the sum of all three crystal directions of dielectric tensor, i.e. Rxx(ω), Ryy(ω), and Rzz(ω). The dielectric tensor components of the imaginary part of the dielectric function (permittivity) completely determine the principal linear optical dispersions responsible for the absorption spectra, refractive indices and reflection spectra (reflectivity) shown in Fig. 7 and 8. It should be underlined that the contribution of different BZ points will be different due to the van Howe singularities.66 The dispersion of the imaginary part can be calculated using the expression given in ref. 67: (6)In this expression the indices m and e are the mass and charge of an electron and ω represents the varying optical frequency, V stands for the volume of the unit cell, in bracket notation p represents the momentum operator, and |knσ〉 describes the crystal wave function with crystal momentum k and σ spin which correspond to the eigenvalue Enk. The Fermi occupation distribution function corresponds to fkn which ensures the counting of transitions from the occupied to unoccupied state while the term δ(Ekn′ − Ekn − ℏω) shows the condition for the conservation of total energy. The phonons have negligible contribution to ε2(ω), as they mainly define the broadening of the spectral lines.48 The calculated dielectric properties are obtained directly from the Quantum Espresso simulation package37 using random phase approximation (RPA).41 The dielectric function and imaginary part can be calculated using eqn (5) and (6). The real part ε1(ω) of the dielectric function is calculated from the Kramers–Kronig relationship, (7)Meanwhile, the absorption coefficient α(ω) is given as (8)

The intensity of absorption depends directly on the number of light-absorbing particles, and the absorbance is proportional to the specific absorption coefficient. The absorption displays the highest values in the range of visible light (1.55 to 3.10 eV) for almost all the NW configurations (Fig. 7 and 8). There are many peaks that can be explained by the interband transitions using partial and total density of states. The intensity of the absorption spectra varies significantly throughout the studied energy range, so at low energies (infra-red), for example, there are not many electronic states that play a role as initial states in the absorption processes. Whenever the imaginary part of a material's dielectric function is zero, the material is transparent, while for non-zero values it begins adsorption. The materials become transparent when the frequency of the incident light is higher than the plasma frequency and here the maximum plasma resonance is at 10 eV.
The reflectivity spectrum R(ω) of Fe and Co NWs is given in Fig. 7 and 8 as a sum of all three crystal directions. The R(0) values of Fe NWs are 0.74, 0.51 and 0.64 (Table 2). There is less isotropy between Ry to Rz with Rx (not shown here), while high anisotropy is observed in the particular direction for Fe-LC-1R NWs. Considering all the studied configurations of Fe and Co NWs, we conclude that the 3R NWs have much higher anisotropy compared to the 2R and 1R NWs. The reflectivity maximum lies in the energy range 0.4–8.0 eV and arises from the interband transition for both cases. These materials possess reflectivity in an average energy (frequency) range; the variation of reflectivity with energy is suitable for a Bragg's reflector. 3R diameter systems are more dominant compared to the other two systems.

4. Conclusions
In this work, we have summarized structural properties of metallic nanowires; structural configurations alter the original electrical, thermoelectric, optical, and magnetic properties and cohesive energy of the materials. We have categorized Fe and Co NWs in three configurations based on their dimensionalities and the atomic structure. We believe that the basic understanding of the monatomic transition metal chains has to comprise both the infinite and finite structures. However, it is encouraging that the effects of the structural configuration in 1D NWs are not necessarily detrimental and from 1R of LC to 2 × 2 NWs configuration, magnetic moment has been decreased. The charge densities suggest covalent or metallic bonding as displayed by the amount of charge distribution in LCs and 2 × 2 NWs compared to ZZ NWs. The Lorentz relationship is determined and the good ratio of heat and electrical transport of the 1R configuration of Fe and Co LC NWs are observed, while Fe-ZZ-3R and Co-2 × 2-3R configurations are promising candidates as thermal and electrical conduction materials, respectively. The optical properties point to possible absorption applications in the ultraviolet region and introduce new materials for optoelectronic devices. In the mentioned cases, the studied structural configurations provide benefits to the material properties, enhancing device performance, and enable unprecedented functionalities.
