    , Accepted 15th July 2019First published on 16th July 2019AbstractMore versatile and effective strategies are needed to prepare high-quality perovskites and their precursors for promoting the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, the strategy of amine (CH3NH2, MA) gas treatment is successfully exploited to synthesize high-quality MAI precursors and MAPbI3 perovskites. During MA gas treatment, ethylammonium (EA) cations in EAI are completely substituted with the MA cations from MA gas to generate pure MAI. Furthermore, cation substitution induced by MA gas treatment is further extended to convert 1D EAPbI3 perovskites to 3D MAPbI3 perovskites. Compared with traditional perovskites, 1D-to-3D perovskites show a much smoother surface and lower defect density. Consequently, the performance and stability of carbon-based PSCs without hole transport materials are considerably enhanced. Therefore, amine gas treatment has been proved to be a versatile and promising strategy for preparing high-quality perovskites and their precursors.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted intense attention because their high power conversion efficiencies could be achieved by solution-based processes.1,2 Taking CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) as an example, a perovskite film could be easily deposited on a substrate by spin coating the solution containing MAI and PbI2. In addition, the precursor of MAI was commonly synthesized by a solution-based process, during which an MA solution reacts with a HI solution to form MAI.3–5 However, material quality is difficult to be controlled, which affects the device performance reproducibility.
To address this problem, several strategies have been developed, such as solvent engineering,6–8 vapor evaporation,9–11 and amine gas post-treatment.12 Among these strategies, amine gas post-treatment has shown great promise, because the structural and compositional defects in perovskite films could be considerably healed after gas treatment.13–16 Furthermore, some non-perovskite compounds could be easily converted to perovskite compounds after amine gas treatment, demonstrating the flexibility of such a strategy. For example, HPbI3 and NH4PbI3 films could be converted to high-quality MAPbI3 films after MA gas treatment, which has helped to obtain high-performance PSCs.17–20 Therefore, amine gas treatment has shown much prospects for producing high-quality perovskite materials. However, to further extend its application fields and to exploit its new skills, more efforts are needed.
Herein, it was found that gas treatment could even be used to produce a perovskite precursor. That is, an MAI precursor was successfully synthesized by treating ethylammonium iodide (EAI) powder with MA gas, during which EA cations were completely substituted with MA cations. Besides, cation substitution induced by MA gas treatment could be extended to convert 1D EAPbI3 perovskites to 3D MAPbI3 perovskites. Compared with 3D-to-3D perovskites,21 1D-to-3D perovskites have a smoother surface and lower defect density, which help to obtain an enhanced PCE of 13.03% for carbon-based PSCs without hole transport materials (C-PSCs). Furthermore, device stability was also well enhanced along with the PCE, retaining their 95% initial value after 120 days of storage in dry air (humidity ∼ 10–20%).
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows a proposed reaction between solid EAI and MA gas, in which the EA cations in EAI would exchange with MA molecules to generate MAI. We tested such proposition by simply exposing the EAI powder to the MA gas atmosphere. Before the exposure to the MA gas atmosphere, the EAI crystals are translucent and granular (see the photograph in Fig. 1a). After the MA gas exposure, these crystals were quickly changed to a transparent liquid-like state. After being removed from the MA atmosphere, they became solid again and the color of the crystal particles turned white.

The photograph and (b) XRD patterns of the EAI powder before and after MA gas treatment. 1H NMR spectra of the EAI powder (c) before and (d) after MA gas treatment. The species corresponding to the 1H peaks are highlighted. 
The XRD patterns were obtained to evaluate the composition of the EAI powder before and after being exposed to the MA gas atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 1b, the XRD pattern of the EAI powder was well consistent with that reported for EAI in the literature. After the exposure to the MA gas atmosphere, the pattern was significantly changed. Almost all the pristine intense diffraction peaks disappeared, accompanied by the appearance of some new intense diffraction peaks. After careful analysis, these new peaks were perfectly indexed to the characteristic diffraction peaks of MAI, which implies the complete exchange between EA cations in EAI and MA molecules.22–24 To confirm this, 1H NMR spectra were further obtained and are shown in Fig. 1c and d. The species corresponding to the 1H peaks are clearly highlighted in the graph.25,26 The intensity ratio of B to C was 1:0.63, which was well consistent with the proton number ratio of –CH3/–CH2– in EA+, further confirming the highly pure EAI powder. After the MA gas exposure, both B and C peaks disappeared and a new peak at 2.385 ppm was detected. Such a new peak could be indexed to the proton of –CH3 in MA+. Therefore, 1H NMR spectra further confirm the complete exchange between the EA cations in EAI and MA molecules, and pure MAI was successfully obtained by such a new strategy. We believe that such a method could be applied to synthesize other ammonium halide compounds.
The promising exchange between the EA cations in EAI and MA molecules aroused our interest in testing the possibility to exchange EA cations in 1D EAPbI3 perovskites with MA molecules to generate 3D MAPbI3 perovskites. The 1D EAPbI3 perovskites were first prepared using the EAPbI3 precursor solution with the PbI2/EAI ratios of 1/0.8, 1/1 and 1/1.2. As a control group, an MAPbI3 film was also prepared by dissolving equimolar MAI and PbI2 in DMF solution.

Fig. 2b1 shows the XRD patterns of the EAPbI3 films obtained from different PbI2/EAI ratios and the MAPbI3 film. Regardless of the PbI2/EAI ratios, all three films show similar diffraction peaks at 11.78°, 16.14°, 26.01°, 30.09° and 32.32°, which could be well indexed to the (102), (014), (214), (220) and (028) planes of EAPbI3, respectively.26 Therefore, 1D EAPbI3 perovskites have been obtained by a one-step method. At PbI2/EAI = 1/0.8 and 1/1.2, the intensity of the diffraction peaks is relatively weak, while the intensity of all these diffraction peaks is considerably increased at PbI2/EAI = 1/1, suggesting that excess PbI2 or EAI might inhibit the growth and crystallinity of EAPbI3 perovskites.27 For the MAPbI3 film, the diffraction peaks at 14.21°, 20.12°, 24.60°, 28.51° and 32.11° are in good agreement with the characteristic peaks of the (110), (112), (202), (220) and (310) planes of MAPbI3, indicating that a pure MAPbI3 phase was obtained.28

(b1) XRD patterns of the 1D EAPbI3 films obtained from the EAPbI3 solution with different PbI2/EAI ratios and the 3D MAPbI3 films obtained from the MAPbI3 solution. (b2) The corresponding XRD patterns of the MA gas-treated samples in (b1). 1H NMR spectra of the 1D EAPbI3 films (c1) before and (c2) after the MA gas treatment. 
After all these samples were exposed to the MA gas atmosphere, the peak position and number on the three XRD patterns were exactly the same, and these diffraction peaks could be indexed to the characteristic planes of 3D MAPbI3 perovskites, as shown in Fig. 2b2. Therefore, 1D EAPbI3 perovskites have been converted to 3D MAPbI3 perovskites after MA gas treatment, which suggests the efficient substitution of EA cations with MA cations during such a simple process. Besides, it is worth noting that the MAPbI3 film from PbI2/EAI = 1/1 exhibits the most intense diffraction peaks among different MAPbI3 films, indicating the highest crystallinity.29 Therefore, such a cation substitution strategy could successfully obtain MAPbI3 perovskites with high crystallinity through 1D-to-3D conversion.
To further evaluate such an exchange process, 1H NMR spectra were obtained for the EAPbI3 samples obtained from PbI2/EAI = 1/1 before and after the MA gas treatment. The 1H NMR sample was prepared by scratching away the films, followed by dissolving them in deuterated DMSO. As shown in Fig. 2c1, two intense signal peaks at 1.115 ppm and 2.802 ppm are observed, which are similar to the 1H NMR spectra, as shown in Fig. 1c. These characteristic peaks could be assigned to –CH3 and –CH2– in EA+, respectively.25 However, as shown in Fig. 2c2, the corresponding peak signals of EA+ disappeared completely after the MA gas treatment, while a new signal at 2.377 ppm from MA+ appeared without any other impurity peak, verifying the complete conversion from 1D EAPbI3 to 3D MAPbI3. Thus, a new strategy is uncovered by the XRD patterns and the 1H NMR spectra confirming that highly pure 3D MAPbI3 can be synthesized via a 1D EAPbI3 precursor template through cation substitution.30,31
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained to investigate the film morphology before and after cation substitution. Before MA gas treatment, as shown in Fig. 3a, the EAPbI3 film morphology gradually changes as the EAI content increases. At PbI2/EAI = 1/0.8, the EAPbI3 film is rough with some crystal aggregates dispersing on the surface and some voids are also observed. For PbI2/EAI = 1/1, the EAPbI3 film is mainly constructed with crystal aggregates with a dimension of around 1 μm, and the dimension and number of voids have both obviously increased. As the EAI content further increases (PbI2/EAI = 1/0.8), the film becomes more rough and the dimension of crystal aggregates and voids largely increases. For the MAPbI3 film obtained from a PbI2 + MAI solution, many clusters are formed by a group of needle crystals that are arranged in a similar direction.

(b) The corresponding top-view SEM images of the MA gas-treated samples in (a). (c) UV-Vis spectra and (d) TRPL spectra of the different perovskite films. The PL decay was fitted to a biexponential equation Y = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2). 
After MA gas treatment, as shown in Fig. 3b, the morphology of the final MAPbI3 films is completely changed. All films are fully covered on the TiO2 scaffolds. They are really compact and smooth, and no obvious grain feature is observed. However, compared with the MAPbI3 films obtained from PbI2/EAI = 1/0.8, 1/1.2 and PbI2 + MAI solutions, the MAPbI3 film from PbI2/EAI = 1/1 is more compact and smoother.
The optical properties of different perovskite films were further studied by UV-Vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3c, all spectra show a similar onset at around 780 nm, corresponding to the band gap of 3D MAPbI3 perovskites,32 which suggests their similar composition to MAPbI3. The steady-state PL spectra, as shown in Fig. S1†, also exhibit the peaks at close positions, agreeing with the UV-Vis results. In addition, among these samples, the PbI2/EAI = 1/1 sample shows the strongest absorption intensity, implying the highest crystal quality, which is well consistent with the XRD results.
TRPL spectra, as shown in Fig. 3d, indicate that the MAPbI3 film obtained from PbI2/EAI = 1/1 has the longest photoluminescence lifetime of 65.14 ns among all these perovskite films, while the photoluminescence lifetimes are 49.29 ns and 15.32 ns with PbI2/EAI = 1/0.8 and PbI2/EAI = 1/1.2, respectively. In contrast, the MAPbI3 film from PbI2 + EAI has a shorter lifetime of 20.45 ns. In previous reports, the longer PL lifetime represents the slower non-radiative decay, indicating the reduction in non-radiative recombination and the extension of carrier lifetime.33–35 The longer lifetime of the PL transition in the PbI2/EAI = 1/1 processed film may be attributed to the increase in crystallinity and the decrease in defect density, which happens in the structural transformation during cation substitution under the MA atmosphere.
To evaluate the PV performance, C-PSCs, as shown in Fig. 4a, were prepared by directly depositing a carbon electrode on the perovskite films. The PV performance was evaluated by recording the current density–voltage (J–V) curves (Fig. 4b) and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters were calculated (Table 1). The PbI2 + MAI device as a control group shows a decent PCE of 11.88%, with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 19.39 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.65. In contrast, the PbI2/EAI = 1/0.8 device exhibits a relatively low performance with a Voc of 0.97 V, a Jsc of 15.79 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.57 and a PCE of 8.74%. Impressively, the PbI2/EAI = 1/1 device exhibits a significantly enhanced PCE of 13.03%, with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 19.96 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.69, which is higher than those obtained by the PbI2 + MAI device. The PV performance is considerably reduced for the PbI2/EAI = 1/1.2 device with a PCE of 6.94%. The low performance of PbI2/EAI = 1/0.8 and PbI2/EAI = 1/1.2 should be due to the low crystal quality and relatively rougher surface of the perovskite layer. The highest crystal quality and the smoothest film surface of the perovskite layer could well account for the enhanced performance of the PbI2/EAI = 1/1 device. Therefore, cation substitution has shown great promise to obtain high-quality perovskite films for fabricating high-performance C-PSCs.

To attest the photovoltaic performance, the stable output current density at the maximum power point was measured for the PbI2/EAI = 1/1 device. By holding the voltage at VMP = 0.73 V for 180 s, a stabilized PCE of 12.7% was achieved, which is close to the value obtained from the J–V curves. The calibration conducted by the PV Metrology Lab of NIM (National Institute of Metrology, China) obtained a certified PCE of 12.4%. The PCE distribution of the PbI2/EAI = 1/1 device, as shown in Fig. S3†, indicates a decent performance reproducibility with an average PCE of 11.5%, while the J–V curves obtained from reverse and forward scanning show negligible hysteresis. The IPCE spectrum, as shown in Fig. 4d, displays a high average value of around 70% in the wavelength range from 350 to 750 nm, with an integrated Jsc close to that obtained from the J–V curves.
The stability of the PbI2/EAI = 1/1 and PbI2 + MAI devices was studied by storing them in dry air and at room temperature. The PbI2/EAI = 1/1 device maintains over 95% of its initial PCE after 120 days of storage, while only 78% of the initial PCE is maintained for the PbI2 + MAI device after 80 days of storage, indicating the significantly higher stability of the former device. Therefore, compared with the 3D-to-3D strategy, the 1D-to-3D strategy has shown great promise for preparing high-quality perovskites to fabricate more stable C-PSCs.
3. Conclusion
A cation substitution strategy has been successfully developed to prepare perovskite precursors and perovskite films. EAI could be completely converted to MAI by exposing the EAI powder to MA gas, during which EA cations in the EAI powder were substituted with cations from the MA gas. Furthermore, 1D EAPbI3 were converted to 3D MAPbI3 by the same process. Compared with 3D-to-3D conversion, 1D-to-3D conversion generated a MAPbI3 layer with higher crystallinity and lower defect density. As a result, C-PSCs obtained from 1D-to-3D conversion achieved an improved PCE of 13.03% and enhanced stability (120 days). This work provides a new strategy to prepare high-quality perovskite layers for high performance C-PSCs.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials
FTO (30 Ω cm−2)-coated glass was purchased from Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co. Ltd. Lead(II) iodide (PbI2) and methylamine ethanol solution were purchased from Aladdin corporation. Ethylammonium iodide (EAI CH3CH2NH3I) was purchased from Dyesol Corporation in Australia. The commercial carbon paste was produced by Guangzhou Seaside Technology Co., Ltd.
4.2 Device fabrication

4.2.1. TiO2 mesoporous scaffolds. 
FTO glass substrates were washed with soap water, ethanol, and isopropanol sequentially. After that, a TiO2 compact layer (0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis-(acetylacetonate) in 1-butanol solution) was deposited on the FTO substrates at 2000 rpm for 20 s and then heated at 125 °C for 5 min. A mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited on the TiO2 compact layer at 5000 rpm for 30 s using a commercial TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30 NRD, Dyesol) after the substrates were cooled down to room temperature. For the deposition of a TiO2 scaffold, the TiO2 paste was diluted in ethanol solvent at a mass ratio of 1:1.75. Then the TiO2 scaffold was deposited by spin-coating the diluted TiO2 paste onto the substrates. Finally, the TiO2 mesoporous layer-coated substrates were sintered at 550 °C for 150 min in a muffle furnace.


4.2.2. The conversion process of EAI to MAI. 
EAI powder on a glass piece was placed into a closed container filled with MA gas and kept for 30 min. When the EAI powder was completely transformed to a transparent liquid, the sample was taken out and annealed at 100 °C for 7 min to obtain the final MAI powder.


4.2.3. Precursor layers. 
For (PbI2 + EAI)-processed precursor layers, different precursor solutions were prepared by adding EAI into a 2.0 M PbI2 DMF solution in a series of molar ratios. The molar ratios of EAI/PbI2 were set as 0, 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.2 and 1.5. For the control group, the PbI2-processed precursor solution was obtained by dissolving 1.2 M PbI2 in DMF solution. The (PbI2 + MAI)-processed precursor was prepared by mixing PbI2 and MAI in a 1:1 molar ratio, followed by dissolving in DMF solution to form a 2 mol L−1 solution. All these precursor layers were prepared by spin-coating the precursor solution at 2000 rpm for 25 s and then heating at 100 °C for 5 min.


4.2.4. Perovskite layers. 
The perovskite films were fabricated by exposing the as-prepared precursor layers to MA vapor at room temperature. The MA atmosphere was produced by heating a methylamine solution in a round bottom three-necked flask at 70 °C. During this process, when the color of the precursor layers turned transparent (after 3–5 s of exposure to the MA atmosphere), the samples were moved out from the atmosphere. Finally, all these samples were annealed at 100 °C for 5 min.


4.2.5. Carbon electrode. 
The carbon electrode was deposited on perovskite layers under ambient conditions, followed by heating at 100 °C for 30 min.

4.3 Characterization
XRD was performed using a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm). Scanning electron microscopy was performed using a JSM-7500F field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) to observe the surface and cross-sectional morphology. UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded on an ultraviolet and visible (UV–vis, UV-3600) spectrophotometer.
The J–V curves were recorded on an IM6x electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH & Co., KG, Germany). A solar light simulator (Newport solar simulator, model number 6255, 150 W Xe lamp, AM 1.5 global filter) was calibrated to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) using a silicon reference solar cell equipped with a KG-5 filter. The solar cells were masked with a metal aperture of 6.12 mm2 to define the active area.
