    , Accepted 13th June 2011First published on 8th July 2011AbstractThe suitability of L-poly(lactic acid) (L-PLA) as a transparent matrix, alternative to poly(methylmetacrilate) (PMMA), for use in luminescent solar concentrators is herein demonstrated. Low molecular weight L-PLA-based films, both chemically modified or blended with an oligothiophene luminescent dye (T5OH), showed excellent processability, photostability, and exhibited fluorescence quantum yields (of about 35%) even higher than T5OH-doped PMMA.

Broader context
Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a unique polymer that in many ways behaves like poly(ethylene terephthalate), but also performs a lot like poly(propylene). Ultimately it may be the polymer with the broadest range of applications and best cost–performance balance, because of its ability to be stressed or thermally crystallized, impact modified, filled, copolymerized, and processed in most polymer processing equipment. PLA cost-effectiveness as an alternative to petrochemical-based plastics will increase demand for agricultural products such as corn and sugar beets, and is an advanced example of sustainable technology. Moreover, increased utilization of renewable resources will be one of the strong drivers for sustainable products, together with reduced energy consumption, waste generation, and emission of greenhouse gases. PLA is the first commodity plastic to incorporate these principles and Cargill Dow LLC was awarded the 2002 Presidential Green Chemistry Award for their process to produce NatureWorks PLA. Interestingly, its transparency and refractive index are similar to those of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), a polymer widely used for optical applications. The feasibility of using PLA, as an eco-sustainable alternative to PMMA, in luminescent solar concentrators is presented in this paper.

Tailoring new materials for use in eco-design and sustainable development is currently a matter of great concern.1 In this context, polymers that are renewable and compostable hold great promise as environmentally safe alternatives to conventional polymer materials whose wastes from daily use are of high impact on environmental pollution.2
Among the most promising biopolymers, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) has been the subject of increasing attention over recent decades. PLA belongs to the family of aliphatic polyesters, which can be produced in large scale by polymerization of lactic acid, which is obtained by fermentation of starch, sugars, and vegetables.2 Since carbohydrates are intrinsically renewable resources, lactic acid and consequently PLA may be classified as environmentally friendly, biocompatible and compostable depending on the monomer source. Moreover, at the end of its life-cycle, PLA can be completely degraded to carbon dioxide and water in the natural environment without consequent pollution. Finally, PLA is also compostable and after hydrolysis at high temperatures and relative humidity close to 100% it is readily consumed by microbes and its component atoms are converted for possible re-use in growing more corn, beets, rice, etc., for future conversion to PLA.2,3 Thus PLA is less environmentally costly than common recyclable polymers, because there is a limit to the number of recycling iterations that can occur before the recyclable material loses its usefulness. Moreover, of particular importance is the fact that upon polymerization of an appropriate mixture of LL, DD and LD-lactide (i.e. dimers of lactic acid), a wealth of poly(lactic acid)s with morphologies that range from highly crystalline to amorphous and with tailored rheological properties is accessible,2,3 making PLA suitable for applications ranging from short-term packaging to biomedical applications (i.e. implants, sutures, drug encapsulation).2
In this study, we investigate the suitability of stereo-regular L-poly(lactic acid) (L-PLA), prepared from LL-lactide, as a transparent polymer matrix for luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs).4LSCs are simple optical systems consisting of a flat plate made of a highly transparent polymer, generally poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), in which small amounts of luminescent species (i.e. organic dyes) are dispersed.5 The luminescent dyes absorb part of the incoming sunlight and isotropically re-emit with their characteristic spectrum. Depending on the refractive index (nr) of the matrix, most of the emitted light is trapped into the plate and is guided by total internal reflection toward its side-edges, were solar cells are placed, thus realizing the concentration of solar light flux (see sketch in the table of contents entry). An extremely high luminescence quantum yield and a large Stokes shift are among the main requirements for the dyes of LSCs with high efficiency (defined as the ratio between the electrical power extracted from the solar cells and the irradiation power incident on the illuminated surface of the concentrator). Efficiencies up 7% have been reported in the literature for LSCs.4 Compared with common complex solar concentrators made of lenses and mirrors, LSCs are cheap, flat, light in weight, static (solar tracking is not required) and particularly suited for integration into buildings, thus LSCs have the potential of being a promising technology for cost reduction in photovoltaic systems.
Due to its ready availability, processability, stability under solar irradiation and high refractive index (1.49), PMMA is commonly used as the transparent matrix in LSCs. Interestingly, PLA has a slightly lower refractive index (around 1.45)6 than PMMA, as well as the same good processability. The reduction of the maximum trapped light due to the lower nr is negligible (74% vs. 72%, for PMMA and PLA matrix, respectively),7 thus PLA could be a potential eco-compatible alternative to PMMA.
In previous studies aimed at textile industry applications of PLA fibers,8 the ability to dye PLA with a range of commercial disperse dyes, in terms of dye exhaustion, color yield, and color fastness properties of the resultant blends, has been examined and compared to that of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). Such studies showed a comparable dye photostability in PLA and PET. However, to the best of our knowledge no investigations on films of dye-doped PLA have been reported so far.
In order to investigate the potential of PLA as a matrix for LSCs, the optical properties of films of L-PLA and PMMA blended with a luminescent oligothiophene (i.e.3′′-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′:5′′′,2′′′′-quinquethiophene (T5OH), Scheme 1) were compared by means of UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Better control of the dye localization inside the solid sample can be achieved by sticking T5OH to the L-PLA backbone, therefore, in addition to the blended films (i.e.PMMA@T5OH, PLA@T5OH), samples of dye-modified L-PLA (i.e.L-PLA:T5O) were prepared in which T5OH was covalently linked to the polymer matrix (Scheme 1) and these were compared to the blended ones. The uniformity of both morphology and light emission was studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM), respectively. T5OH was used as the dye because of the remarkable stability of oligothiophene materials.9 Moreover, thanks to the beta inner substitution T5OH is soluble in common organic solvents, thus it can be easily dispersed both in PMMA and L-PLA solutions. The beta substitution also prevents aggregation in the solid state, thus avoiding photoluminescence quenching. T5OH was chosen also because its hydroxy-functionality makes it a suitable catalytic initiator for the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of lactide to give terminally functionalized L-PLA. For better comparison, the dye content was kept comparable for all samples (∼1% by weight). A commercially available PMMA was used for this study, while L-PLA and L-PLA:T5O were prepared by a Sn(II)octoate-catalyzed (ROP) of LL-lactide, respectively, without or in the presence of 1 mol% of T5OH (i.e. referred to the amount of LL-lactide) as catalytic initiator, as shown in Scheme SI_1 (Supporting Information†). The choice of the appropriate initiator to lactide molar ratio allowed us to control the molecular weight of the target functionalized polymer in order to have L-PLA and L-PLA:T5O of comparable molecular weight. The 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra acquired for L-PLA:T5O in CD2Cl2 confirmed the covalent bonding of T5O to L-PLA. The molecular structures of all the materials used for this study are displayed in Scheme 1. The transparency of L-PLA and PMMA matrices is compared in Fig. 1(a), for spin-coated thin films of the same thickness. L-PLA is shown to be as transparent as PMMA in the whole region of the solar spectrum, thus allowing sunlight to penetrate the matrix and be absorbed only by the emitting dye. PMMA@T5OH, L-PLA@T5OH and L-PLA:T5O films were deposited from chloroform solutions onto quartz substrates by doctor-blade technique.

(b) Absorption (left) and emission (right) spectra of L-PLA:T5O (solid, red lines), L-PLA@T5OH (dashed, green lines), and PMMA@T5OH (dash-dot, blue lines) films on quartz substrates. 
Absorption and emission spectra of samples of comparable thickness and absorbance (6–8 μm and A = 0.8–1.1), are shown in Fig. 1(b). In all cases, similarly to T5OH in solution (see Fig. SI_1†), a featureless absorption band, with the maximum centered at about 400 nm and half-height bandwidth of 100 nm, and a structured emission spectrum, with two maxima located at 485 and 515 nm and a shoulder at longer wavelength (560 nm), are observed as the typical features of the quinquethiophene chromophore, as reported in the literature.10 Some spectral differences are detectable, mostly in emission bands, that could be ascribed to different environmental effects on the ground state and/or excited state of the dye. Interestingly, both L-PLA:T5O and L-PLA@T5OH samples showed the same fluorescence quantum yield of 0.17 (measured by a calibrated integrating sphere system), which is higher than that of T5OH in dilute solution (0.11), indicating that the radiative decay is improved by the polymeric matrix independently of the ‘type’ of mixture (covalent linkage or physical blend). On the contrary, PMMA@T5OH films showed a markedly lower quantum yield (0.11), compared to the L-PLA-based samples. The relevant result here is the relative variation of luminescence quantum yield of around 35%, highly reproducible, and not the absolute low values. The effect of the environment polarity/polarizability on the spectral characteristics of oligothiophene, and in particular on the emission spectrum, is well established11 as well as effects on luminescence in dye doped polymer films.12 Therefore, the improved emission yield of L-PLA-based samples could originate from a different polarity and/or dielectric constant of the transparent matrices. Studies on blends of other classes of dyes are currently under way to shed some light on this phenomenon and will be reported in a forthcoming full paper.

SEM and LSCM were employed to check the morphologic and fluorescence homogeneity of all the films investigated. No appreciable morphological difference between the two PLA-based samples were observed, as shown by the SEM micrographs of the random-fractured films (side-view) (Fig. SI_2†). As expected, the PMMA@T5OH sample appears more amorphous compared to PLA ones (Fig. SI_2c†). LSCM analysis on the same films proved a uniform dye distribution in the three samples (Fig. 2(a)–(c)). Imaging using the spectral detection module showed that emission originated from the thiophene fluorophore (spectrum in Fig. 2(d), for the L-PLA:T5O sample). The intensity profile, both in the xy plane along the arrows shown in the images and along the z-direction, exhibited homogeneous fluorescence intensity in both scan directions, without showing appreciable differences for the three samples (Fig. 2(e) and Fig. SI_3†).

(e) Intensity profile along the arrows in Fig. (a)–(c) (black, red, green for L-PLA:T5O, L-PLA@T5OH and PMMA@T5OH, respectively). Pixel size corresponds to 0.1 μm. 
Stability under solar irradiation is a requirement as important as transparency, homogeneity, and high refractive index for the polymer matrix of luminescent solar concentrators. Hence, the stability of L-PLA@T5OH and L-PLA:T5O against polymer chain degradation (i.e., hydrolysis process) was proved by exposing them to white light (550 W m−2) in a Solar Box. Gel-Permeation Chromatography (GPC) was the method of choice to control eventual changes of the molecular weight of L-PLA. The experimental GPC data (i.e. Mw, Mn and polydispersity (PDI)) shown in Table 1 (Fig. SI_4†) confirm the stability of the polymer backbone with time.

In conclusion, for the first time our data show that L-PLA, having similar refractive index, processability and transparency to those of PMMA, is a viable alternative to PMMA as transparent matrix for luminescent solar concentrators. Actually, both blended and covalently dye-modified L-PLA films were very stable under white light irradiation, and exhibited a fluorescence quantum yield that is significantly higher (about 35%) when compared to samples with PMMA as transparent matrix. So poly(lactic acid) could have the potential of being even superior to PMMA in terms of optical requirements, but certainly has the great advantage of being eco-sustainable. Finally, the covalent binding of hydroxyl-substituted luminescent organic dyes to L-PLA by the proposed synthetic methodology could allow the fine tailoring of the optical response of the resulting polymer by selecting proper combinations of different dyes and/or by tuning the dye mutual distance and localization along the polymer chain, thus opening up new possibilities for the application of PLA-based matrices as luminescent concentrators. Studies in this direction are currently under way in our laboratories.
Experimental details
Synthesis of L-PLA and L-PLA:T5O: In a Schlenk tube LL-Lactide (2.12 g) was heated at 130 °C for 3h in the presence of Sn(Oct)2 (0.5 mol% with respect to the amount of Lactide), obtaining non functionalized L-PLA. An analogous reaction conducted in the presence of T5OH (1 mol%, with respect to the amount of LL-lactide) yielded L-PLA:T5O. The purification step for both polymers was identical, comprising the dissolution of the crude polymer in chloroform and its slowly precipitation by n-hexane. The purified polymers (i.e. with traces of LL-lactide eliminated) were separated by means of a Büchner funnel. The polymers were then additionally dried overnight in vacuum at room temperature. Yield (L-PLA): 1.78 g (84%); Mn = 14439 g mol−1, Mw = 28834 g mol−1 (PDI = 2.00). Yield (L-PLA@T5O): 0.245 g (42.9%); Mn = 19001 g mol−1, Mw = 28622 g mol−1 (PDI = 1.51). 1H integrals are not reported. Nevertheless the degree of polymerization has been estimated from the integral ratio of the 1H NMR signals centred at 4.36 (i.e. terminal CH) and 5.18 ppm (i.e. internal CH), giving polymerization degrees of 200 and 250 for L-PLA and L-PLA:T5O, respectively. (NMR spectroscopic data for L-PLA and L-PLA:T5O are reported in the Supporting Information†).
