    , Accepted 29th August 2018First published on 29th August 2018AbstractZinc (Zn) surface plasmons (SPs) have been widely reported for their impressive performance in improving the optical properties of semiconductors. Zn is an effective metal with SPs response in the ultraviolet region, but the disadvantage of strong metal activity limits the application mentioned above. Here, in order to ensure the stability of metal Zn, ZnO/Zn microspheres were synthesized by an one-step laser ablation method to distribute Zn nanoparticles simultaneously on both inner and outer surfaces of ZnO microspheres. Lasing performance enhancement and a lower threshold were obtained in the composite which originates from the coupling between Zn SPs and the excitation light source. Accompanied by the lasing emission measurements, the coupling mechanism was explained through time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL) for the samples by rapid annealing in situ. This work displays the results of lasing enhancement and the physical process of Zn SPs resonance in the ZnO/Zn microsphere.
1. Introduction
Owing to its direct wide band gap of 3.37 eV and high exciton binding energy of 60 meV, zinc oxide (ZnO) has been considered as one of the most promising ultraviolet (UV) lasing materials and its lasing performances have been widely explored in the past decades.1–4 A resonant coupling between light field and surface plasmons (SPs) has resulted in the significant enhancement of photoluminescence (PL) efficiencies of semiconductors.5,6 Various metals such as Au,7,8 Ag,9,10 Pt11,12 and Al13,14 have been employed in ZnO nano/microstructures for the enhancements of near band edge emissions (NBE). Among them, a plasmonic material of aluminum (Al) has been considered as a desirable candidate to enhance the optical performances of ZnO owing to its low cost and abundance in nature. For example, Lu et al.15,16 obtained more than 170-fold UV PL enhancement and more than 10-fold stimulated emission due to strong resonant surface plasmon coupling of Al nanoparticles (NPs) which decorated a ZnO microrod. In addition, zinc (Zn) as another plasmonic material has a similar Fermi level with Al at −4.3 eV versus AVS.17,18 Because of its improved UV absorption and low cost, Zn has also been considered as a suitable candidate for the PL enhancements of ZnO nano/microstructures. Actually, the optical extinction range of 200–400 nm for Zn NPs has been confirmed both numerically and experimentally which is ascribed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in a broad sense.19,20 Furthermore, Aslan et al.21 reported the enhancements of both the electric field and fluorescence in nanostructured Zn films. Ahmad et al.22 recently observed the plasmonic effect of Zn NPs on a TiO2 monolayer photoanode for their applications in dye sensitized solar cells. Based on the above discussion, Zn metal NPs can definitely enhance the PL properties and even lasing performance of ZnO.
The phenomenon of SP-assisted light emission improvement has been recently observed in ZnO/Zn composites.23,24 For instance, Tang et al.18 reported the enhanced PL performances of ZnO/Zn composite nanowires through the SPs effect. Importantly, the selection of synthetic method is a key issue to obtain Zn NPs decorated ZnO microcavity systems. According to recent literature, the ZnO/Zn composites have been synthesized using hydrothermal and laser ablation methods in solution. However, the structural properties of these composites are not suitable for the optical cavity to yield stimulated emission. Moreover, the enhancements in optical performance and the corresponding gain mechanisms have not been identified clearly.
In this paper, Zn-rich ZnO microspheres have been synthesized using an one-step laser ablation method in which the Zn NPs have been distributed simultaneously on both inner and outer surfaces of ZnO microspheres. The lasing and absorption spectra of samples here predicted the SPs coupling after thermal annealing (TA) process. Raman spectroscopy has been used to monitor changes in composition of samples after a rapid annealing (RA) process and their lasing performances have also been studied. A float in the lasing performance is ascribed to competition between Zn SPs effect and gain variation of ZnO. The SPs coupling process has been further analyzed through time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL) after the RA process. Based on our results, we propose that the present optical cavity with improved performances is beneficial for potential applications in advanced electronics and optoelectronics.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Sample preparation
The ZnO/Zn microspheres were prepared by using an one-step laser ablation method.25 A schematic illustration for the formation of ZnO/Zn microspheres is displayed in Fig. 1. During the experiment, the Nd:YAG laser beam (λ = 1064 nm, 10 Hz) is focused on a metal target of Zn using a convex lens (f = 100 mm). The deionized water covered silicon (Si) substrate was placed under the Zn target to collect ZnO/Zn microspheres. Under high power laser irradiation, the Zn target was melted and then dropped on the substrate. The ZnO/Zn microspheres were formed as a result of oxidation from the air–water environment as well as surface tension from water.

2.2 Sample characterization
The morphological and structural properties of ZnO/Zn microspheres were characterized by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Carl Zeiss Ultra Plus) equipped with an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) (Oxford X-Max 50), X-ray diffraction (XRD-7000, Shimadzu) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100). The absorption measurements were carried out using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU UV-2600). The samples were excited by a 325 nm femtosecond (fs) laser (pulse duration of 100 fs and repetition rate of 1000 Hz) to observe the PL and lasing performances using a micro-photoluminescence (μ-PL) system where the excitation lasing was focused by a microscope objective (10×) and the emission signal was collected and transmitted into a charge-coupled-device array detector in an optical-multichannel analyzer (OMA) system (Princeton, Acton SP2500i). The Raman spectra were recorded using the JOBIN YVON HR 800 micro-Raman system under a 325 nm laser by a μ-PL system through an objective of OLYMPUS, NA = 0.3, 40×. The TRPL measurements were performed using an optically triggered streak camera system (Optronic GmbH SC-10) at an excitation wavelength of 325 nm fs pulsed laser. All of the measurements were carried out at room temperature.
2.3 Annealing process
As mentioned before, to determine the SPs coupling process in ZnO/Zn microspheres, the sample was treated with different annealing processes. The ZnO/Zn microspheres were converted into pure ZnO microspheres through TA method. This process was carried out in a tubular furnace under vacuum at 500 °C for 2 h. Moreover, the Zn NPs were partly converted into ZnO through RA method. This process was carried out under UV laser irradiation. It was used to change the content of Zn in an individual ZnO/Zn microsphere.26 Moreover, the RA process was carried out in situ to simultaneously analyze the performances of samples using lasing, Raman and lifetime measurements with different time intervals between RA process and these measurements.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structural characterization

Fig. 2(a) depicts a typical SEM image of ZnO/Zn microspheres on a Si substrate. A smooth surface of the microsphere is confirmed from the enlarged SEM image with a diameter of 1.15 μm as depicted in the inset of Fig. 2(a). The EDS spectrum in Fig. 2(b) confirms the presence of Zn and O elements in the microsphere. The elemental mapping images reveal the uniform distribution of Zn and O elements which correspond to the distinct profile of ZnO/Zn microspheres. To estimate the effects of RA and TA processes in ZnO/Zn microspheres, elemental analysis was also performed for pristine, RA and TA samples and their compositions are listed in the inset table of Fig. 2(b). From the table, it can be observed that the atomic ratio of Zn and O elements vary across samples and the percentage of O increased with respect to the annealing process. This behaviour is observed from the ratio of Zn and O elements. To analyze the structural characteristics of the samples, XRD measurements have been carried out before and after the TA process and are shown in Fig. 2(c). From the figure, it can be noted that the two diffraction peaks at angles of 39.20° and 43.43° correspond to Zn planes of (100) and (101), respectively. Moreover, the diffraction peak at 36.49° belongs to the (101) plane of ZnO. After the TA process, the XRD pattern displays a single diffraction peak at 33.14° which corresponds to the (002) plane of ZnO. This behaviour confirms a transformation of ZnO/Zn microspheres into ZnO microspheres. To further demonstrate the structural properties of ZnO/Zn microspheres, we analysed a high-resolution TEM image of ZnO/Zn depicted in Fig. 2(d). A granular lattice structure of Zn is indicated with blue circles in Fig. 2(d) which indicates the presence of ZnO and Zn NPs in the microspheres. The magnified high-resolution TEM image of the pink circle is obtained in Fig. 2(e). It shows lattice fringe distances of 0.22 nm, 0.24 nm and 0.26 nm which correspond to the planes of (101) and (100) for hexagonal wurtzite growth of Zn and the (101) plane of the hexagonal wurtzite growth of ZnO, respectively. Based on above characterization results, it can be proposed that the ZnO/Zn microspheres have metal Zn NPs. To analyse the response of Zn NPs as SPs on ZnO, the absorption measurements of ZnO/Zn composites were carried out and shown in Fig. 2(f). From the figure, it can be noticed that the absorption peak is located at 367 nm which belongs to the wurtzite hexagonal phase of ZnO.27 The other strong peak at 278 nm contributes to resonance between Zn NPs and ZnO.28 When the radii of Zn NPs decreased in the composite system, the absorption spectrum shifted to shorter wavelength ranges.19 Hence, the narrow peak of Zn NPs at 278 nm corresponds to sizes of less than 10 nm.

3.2 Improvement in optical performance
To examine the emission properties of ZnO microspheres with Zn NP decoration, the lasing measurements were conducted at room temperature. The lasing performance of an individual ZnO/Zn microsphere was analyzed as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). Under the excitation power of 31.7 μW, the spectrum exhibits three emission peaks at 387.6 nm, 389.6 nm and 391.6 nm. The accordant mode spacing of 2 nm illustrates that the multipeak structure can be attributed to one set of modes in the microsphere cavity. The strongest resonant mode is centered at 389.6 nm with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.68 nm. Moreover, the calculated quality factor (Q) value is 573 according to the equation of Q = λ/Δλ in which λ and Δλ are referred as wavelength and FWHM of the peak, respectively. For a particular WGM resonator, the resonant wavelengths follow the relation,29mλ = πDn, where an integer number m of resonant wavelengths λ, fits the circular optical path length in the resonator, which depends on its effective refractive index n and size D, where D is the diameter of the ZnO microsphere. According the definition above, the diameter D for the ZnO/Zn microsphere cavity can be estimated to be about 2.4 μm as supported by the well matched SEM image (the inset of Fig. 3(a)). The three lasing peaks in the lasing spectrum are indexed as the mode numbers from 47 to 49. Consequently, although the outer surface of the microsphere is not smooth enough, the gain of the ZnO/Zn sphere is still higher than loss, and ZnO/Zn microspheres show good WGM lasing performance for the total internal reflection at the cavity/air boundary. Moreover, the lasing mode will be proportional to the diameter of the cavity.

Furthermore, the lasing performances of individual ZnO/Zn microsphere have been studied before and after the TA process under different excitation powers as illustrated in Fig. 3(b) and (c). At low excitation power of 9.66 μW, the spectrum exhibits a broad spontaneous emission peak centered at 386.9 nm with a FWHM of 10.4 nm. On increasing the pumping power to 10.32 μW, one sharp peak appears which attributes to a conversion of spontaneous emission into stimulated emission. On further increasing the pumping power up to 11.58 μW, the clear lasing modes are observed and the Q value is 665 based on the strongest resonant mode at 388.9 nm with a FWHM of 0.57 nm. To obtain pure ZnO, the pristine sample was annealed and its lasing spectra are displayed in Fig. 3(c). At low excitation power of 25.86 μW, a broad spontaneous emission appears at 387.8 nm with a FWHM of 13.3 nm. Moreover, the spontaneous emission is converted into stimulated emission when increasing the pumping power to 28.92 μW. On increasing the pumping power up to 29.34 μW, the clear lasing peaks occur. The strongest mode at 387.6 nm has a FWHM of 0.65 nm with a Q value of 592. Here, the FWHM is increased whereas the Q value is decreased when compared to ZnO/Zn microspheres. The results indicate the improved lasing performance of ZnO/Zn microspheres. In addition, the lasing improvement in ZnO/Zn microspheres is clearly observed from the threshold plots of Fig. 3(d). From the plots, it can be noticed that the threshold value decreases in ZnO/Zn (10.28 μW) when compared to that in pure ZnO (28.18 μW). The inset of Fig. 3(d) represents the lasing responses of ZnO with the presence and absence of Zn under same excitation power of 10.9 μW. According to this figure, the ZnO/Zn microsphere has a strong lasing oscillation whereas the ZnO microsphere has no response under the same excitation power. The improved lasing performance of ZnO/Zn microspheres including higher lasing intensity and lower threshold are attained due to the SPs of Zn. The results are similar to other novel metal-decorated ZnO according to previous literature.12,14,16,30
In order to further confirm the improvement in lasing performance, TRPL measurements were carried out for both ZnO/Zn composites and pure ZnO. For semiconductors, the efficiencies of exciton recombination are inversely proportional to decay lifetime of carrier transport.31 The SPs coupling between metal and semiconductor can highly increase the exciton recombination through decreased lifetime. In addition, the temporal spectroscopic profiles have been collected by using a streak camera as shown in Fig. 3(f) and (g) for ZnO/Zn composites and pure ZnO, respectively. From the figures, it can be observed that the pristine ZnO/Zn composites have a shorter lifetime when compared to pure ZnO. Clear evidence is found from the normalized TRPL spectra and exponential decay fitting curves of Fig. 3(e) at the wavelength of 390 nm. The decay lifetime τ is expressed as I(t) = I0exp(−t/τ) in which I0 is the initial light intensity. The calculated lifetime of ZnO/Zn composites is ∼69.2 ps which is shorter than that of pure ZnO (∼144.8 ps). A shorter lifetime of ZnO/Zn composite provides further evidence for a SPs coupling process between Zn and ZnO.15
3.3 SPs coupling process
To further understand the SPs coupling mechanism, a RA process (in situ method) has been used in a hybrid ZnO/Zn microsphere. The light emission modulation and related exciton dynamic process in ZnO/Zn as a hybrid microcavity with different RA times have been studied. Raman spectroscopy was employed to monitor the content changes in the hybrid structure of ZnO/Zn after the RA process.32,33 The Raman spectra for individual ZnO/Zn microsphere on a Si substrate after the RA process are depicted in Fig. 4(a). From the figure, it can be noticed that there are two peaks at 500 cm−1 and 521 cm−1 from ZnO/Zn microsphere and the Si substrate, respectively. In particular, the peak at 500 cm−1 is attributed to the surface optical phonon vibration mode of ZnO because of the annealing-induced conversions of Zn into ZnO.33–35 With increase in RA time, the peak of ZnO is shifted gradually from 495 cm−1 to 504 cm−1. This is an evidence for the conversion of ZnO from Zn in ZnO/Zn microspheres with respect to the RA time. The lasing properties including intensity and threshold values are functions of RA times, which is confirmed from Fig. 4(b) showing the lasing spectra for the sample with different RA times under an excitation power of 14.5 μW. A phenomenon of fluctuation appears in the spectra with respect to different RA times which can be explained by a competitive process of coupling strength. This phenomenon is clearer than that of other lasing parameters. The variations in lasing intensities and thresholds of sample with different RA times are illustrated in Fig. 4(c). With increase in RA time from 0 to 4 min, a significant fluctuation phenomenon occurred in lasing intensity ranging from 2400 to 4000 as well as the threshold ranging from 10.4 to 12.8 μW. On further increasing the RA time from 5 to 20 min, the lasing intensity is decreased gradually from 3500 to 650 whereas the threshold is increased from 10.4 to 16.8 μW. The lasing improvement in Fig. 4(c) is explained by the competitive mechanism of Zn induced extra optical gain caused by a reduced SPs coupling effect of Zn. The annealing treatment converted the SPs of Zn into ZnO which diminishes the SPs coupling effect and consequently decreases the optical gain. Meanwhile, the increment in ZnO constituents improves the gain of ZnO/Zn microspheres.

The lasing enhancements in Fig. 3 and 4 are attributed to coupling between SPs of Zn and the excitation light source with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. A possible mechanism of SPs coupling with excitons is proposed and illustrated in Fig. 5(a). From the figure, it can be observed that the excitons are generated in ZnO under the photo-pumping process and these excitons are terminated by radiative (krad) or nonradiative (knon) recombination rates. Moreover, η is determined from the ratio of these two recombination rates and expressed as η = krad/(krad + knon). Due to the closer electron vibration energy (ħωSP) of SPs with both the emission energy (ħωem) of 390 nm and excitation energy (ħωex) of 325 nm laser at the surface of ZnO/Zn microsphere, the excitation energy can be easily transferred to SPs mode. The kSP modes are faster than that of krad modes. Hence, the PL decay rates are enhanced through the SPs coupling rate of kSP in ZnO/Zn as shown in Fig. 5(b). In addition, the wave vector matching condition is ignored because of the presence of Zn particles in ZnO. The irregular nanostructure of Zn in the hybrid microsphere allows high momenta of SPs to scatter, lose momentum and radiate light. The NPs distributions of Zn in the microsphere are influenced by RA times. Hence, the lasing modulation has been predicted and obtained in Fig. 4(c). On the other hand, the high electromagnetic fields are introduced from large density of states according to the SPs dispersion diagram which accumulate an increment in the krad mode. This phenomenon has been explained by the Purcell effect.36

The coupling mechanism has been further confirmed by a dynamic process of excitation through TRPL measurements and the results are demonstrated in Fig. 5(b). From the figure, it can be noticed that the lifetime values vary with respect to RA times. In particular, the lifetime is decreased with increase in RA time from 1 to 4 min. In these time regions, the Zn SPs induced extra optical gain which is higher than the ZnO gain. Thus, the lasing performances are improved in these time regions as shown in Fig. 4(c). On increasing the RA time to above 5 min, the lifetime value is also increased. Here, the Zn SPs induced extra optical gain is lower than the ZnO gain. Consequently, the lasing performances become poor in these time regions as depicted in Fig. 4(c). On further increasing the RA time to 10 min, the lifetime is decreased due to improved crystalline quality. However, there are no SPs coupling in these time regions. Hence, the lasing performances are decreased in these time regions as demonstrated in Fig. 4(c).
4. Conclusions
In summary, the Zn-rich ZnO microspheres were successfully obtained using an one-step laser ablation method. The SPs coupling in Zn-rich ZnO microspheres was studied. Moreover, the SPs effect induced lasing improvement was predicted and observed. The lasing intensity was increased whereas the lasing threshold was decreased from 28.18 μW to 10.28 μW in Zn-rich ZnO microspheres when compared to those without Zn NPs. A float in lasing performance was observed which was ascribed to competition between the Zn SPs effect and gain variation of ZnO. A possible SPs coupling mechanism between Zn NPs and ZnO was proposed and further analyzed through TRPL measurements after the RA process.
