    , Accepted 12th October 2014First published on 13th October 2014AbstractIn this work, we have demonstrated the results of several positive effects that arise from the addition of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) to solution-processed small molecule bulk-heterojunction (SM-BHJ) solar cells fabricated from a p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/[6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl-ester (PC71BM). The device with an optimized ratio of GQDs exhibits increased current density and fill factor owing to 10% improved external quantum efficiency (EQE) and induction of a favorable SM-BHJ morphology. Additionally, the multiple scattering of the GQDs in the SM-BHJ leads to longer optical pathlengths according to the analysis of diffuse reflectance spectra and UV/Vis absorption spectra. The GQD inserted SM-BHJ film at the optimized concentration exhibits decreased charge transport resistance significantly by impedance measurements with effective charge extraction in the device which contributes to 15% enhancement of power conversion efficiency (PCE).
Introduction
Sp2-hybridized carbon based nanomaterials (nanocarbons) have attracted considerable attention owing to their low cost, outstanding electronic and mechanical properties, and chemical stability.1 The sufficient conjugation and p-orbitals in the nanocarbons can result in advantageous characteristics, including excellent high carrier mobility,2–4 the quantum hall effect,5–10 the ambipolar electric field effect,1 and massless Dirac fermions.11 As a promising 2D nanocarbon, graphene has been widely exploited for electronic device applications due to its high conductivity in a ∼3.4 Å thick ultrathin monolayer.12,13 However, the ambipolar field effect and the zero band gap property make it difficult to use graphene for opto-electronic devices. In particular, the excellent carrier mobility, the ultrathin thickness, and the high transmittance of the graphene film are considered as the most interesting properties for photovoltaic devices because the solar to power conversion efficiency (PCE) is strongly influenced by the charge carrier transport characteristics from the active layer to both electrodes.14,15 However, the zero band gap property of graphene has been considered as a limiting factor for the light harvesting performance in photovoltaic cells; nevertheless, a monolayer graphene can absorb less than 2.5% incident light, which is analogous to some of the small molecular aromatic rings, due to the extinction coefficient of 105 M−1 cm−1.16
In order to tune the band gap and band edges in graphene, a nanostructure modification of graphene based materials has been conducted by lithography, carbonization, and hydrothermal synthesis.17–19 By controlling the size, shape, and functionalities, not only the band gap energy but also the electron affinity and the carrier mobility of graphene based nanostructures were modified. Interestingly, 0-dimensional graphene quantum dots (GQDs) show significantly attractive features for the optoelectronic devices among the graphene based nanocarbons.20 Because of the quantum confinement effect and the sp3 hybridized carbons on the sides of the edges, GQDs possess a tunable band gap energy as well as show an electronic transition induced by the energy gaps between π and π* or n and π*.21,22 Furthermore, by tailoring the ionization potential and the electron affinity of GQDs, the charge carrier conductance of the optoelectronic devices can be easily tuned.20,23,24
Recently, significant approaches have been developed to introduce GQDs into bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Owing to their considerable potential for flexible photovoltaics and large-scale mass production based on a roll-to-roll process, OPVs have been considered as promising next-generation solar cells.25–29 However, the low carrier mobility of the organic semiconductors restrains the BHJ film thickness caused by the undesired charge recombination, thereby resulting in an insufficient light harvesting performance.30,31 Due to the efficient charge carrier conductance and the balanced light absorptivity of GQDs, high-efficiency polymer solar cells were achieved. In addition, the superb carrier transport properties of GQDs induced a decrease in the series resistance when GQDs were used as electron or hole extraction layers in the organic solar cells.32,33
Here, we report the results of a study that demonstrates several positive effects that arise from the addition of GQDs to solution-processed small molecule based BHJ solar cells fabricated from p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/[6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl-ester (PC71BM). The small molecule donor of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is a very promising material, which has a low molecular weight batch-to-batch variation during synthesis, good solubility in organic solvents, and high performance due to an efficient electron withdrawing functionality, as revealed in previous research.34–36 The GQDs were synthesized by a deoxidization method along with a hydrothermal reduction with oxidized graphene oxide (GO), as reported previously.22
Experimental
Synthesis of GQDs
The synthesis steps of GQDs were followed according to ref. 22 in the Experimental section.
Device fabrication
ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol during ultrasonication. The hole transport layer of PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083) was spin-cast at 5000 rpm for 40 s with a film thickness of ∼35 nm after the treatment with UV ozone (20 min). The BHJ blended solution was prepared from p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM of an overall concentration of 35 mg ml−1 (donor:acceptor = 60:40 weight ratio) in chlorobenzene with 0.4 v/v% diiodooctane (DIO) as the solvent additive. The BHJ solution was stirred at 500 rpm on top of a 60 °C hotplate overnight, and the prepared solution was annealed at 90 °C for 15 min before spin-coating. The BHJ active layer thickness was ∼120 nm. The films were then heated at 80 °C for 10 min to dry the solvents. Finally, Al cathode with a thickness of 100 nm was thermally deposited under 4 × 10−6 Torr using an evaporator.
Characterization
The light source was calibrated using silicon reference cells with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 of an AM 1.5 Global solar simulator. The J–V characteristics of the single and tandem solar cells were measured using a Keithley 236 source unit. All the cell areas were 11.76 mm2 as determined by the aperture for accurate measurement. The EQE was measured after monochromatic power calibration using a QE measurement system (PV measurements, Inc.).
Other characterization methods
The XPS and the FT-IR spectra were obtained using a VG Multilab ESCA 2000 system with a twin-anode Mg/Al kα and a Bruker IFS-66/S spectrometer, respectively. The AFM images of GQDs were obtained in noncontact mode using a Seiko SPA-300HV. The TEM images were measured using a JEOL JEM ARM 200F at 200 kV. Film topography images were obtained using an AFM (Veeco diINNOVA 840-012-711, tapping mode). Impedance spectroscopy measurements were conducted using a potentiostat (CH Instruments, CHI 660) under AM 1.5G 1 sun light illumination from the solar simulator.
Results and discussion
Properties of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and performances of small-molecule solar cells with GQDs
As shown in Fig. 1, the average thickness and diameter of the GQDs were ∼1.5 nm and ∼5 nm, respectively. Owing to the availability of sufficient oxygen-related functional groups, GOs showed sp2 and sp3 hybridization. However, during an oxidization and hydrothermal reduction process, oxygen atoms in the functionalities were steadily reduced resulting in the recovery of sp2 carbons in the GQDs. The inset of Fig. 1 shows the molecular structure of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, PC71BM, and the device sequential structure. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 are 5.12 and 3.34 eV, respectively.31

In Fig. 2(a), the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) shows that sp2 carbons (CC, at 284.5 eV) are dominant in the GQDs, whereas the hydroxyl (C–O, at 286.0 eV) and carbonyl or carboxyl (CO, at 288.0 eV) carbon peaks are less weak. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the GQDs exhibit a weak UV/Vis absorption intensity through the visible range. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) also show the properties of the sp2 carbons and the functional groups are shown in Fig. S1.† In order to incorporate into the BHJ solution, the synthesized GQDs were dispersed in the chlorobenzene solvent by 0.5–2 wt%. Due to the hydrothermal reduction process using the deoxidization method, GQDs could be well dispersed in the organic solvent so that GQDs have sufficient sp2 hybridized carbons. The GQD solution was mixed with the BHJ solution with various weight ratios; the mixture solution was then spin cast on top of the PEDOT:PSS film coated ITO glass.

The reference cell with pristine p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM BHJ shows PCE = 5.42% with JSC = 12.98 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.736 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 57%. To characterize the performance of pristine BHJ and BHJ with GQDs, the additional interlayer is not deposited between BHJ and the Al cathode. When the device was fabricated by the insertion of GQDs with a weight ratio of 0.5%, the VOC, JSC, and FF increase to 0.752 V, 13.58 mA cm−2, and 62%, respectively. The optimum ratio of 1 wt% GQDs in BHJ of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM provided the best efficiency: PCE = 6.40% with JSC = 13.57 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.754 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 63% compared to the device with 2 wt% GQDs: PCE = 5.94% with JSC = 13.35 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.748 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 60%. These results reveal that the most positive effects and the best concentration of GQDs occurred in BHJ, as confirmed by our previous original research.37–39 Particularly, the FF and JSC of small molecule based BHJ solar cells with GQDs exhibit increased values from 57% to 63%, and 12.98 to 13.58 mA cm−2, respectively, as shown in Table 1. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was obtained from the BHJ devices without and with GQDs as shown in Fig. 3(b). The EQE value shows a similar intensity of 60% at the wavelength of 400 nm, while the increased EQE was detected with a 10% average enhancement (see the inset figure) for the device fabricated with an optimized 1 wt% of GQDs in the small molecule BHJ film. Fig. S2† shows the UV/Vis absorption spectra of the BHJ film without (pristine) and with GQD (1 wt%). Thus, the enhanced JSC originated from the improved absorption and increased EQE.
Analysis of small-molecule based BHJ with GQDs: morphology, reflectance, and charge transport resistance
To characterize the morphological changes depending on the GQDs in small molecule based BHJ, atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography analysis was conducted.
In Fig. 4(a) and (b), AFM images show that the BHJ layers with or without GQDs are uniformly coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer without any harmful cracks. However, significant changes in morphology resulted from the 2D based QD structure of the GQDs incorporated in the BHJ layer. As shown in the 3D AFM topography images in Fig. 4(c) and (d), the donor–acceptor (D–A) phase separation shape was changed by incorporating GQDs. The peaks of the domains in the GQD incorporated BHJ film had softened considerably, and the distance between the peaks increased more than the bare BHJ film. This is because the QD structure of the GQDs of 5 nm diameter and 2 nm thickness can have an influence on the morphology since the D–A phase separation distance was less than 20 nm. Furthermore, the distribution of dark and bright regions in the topography phase images shown in Fig. 4(e) and (f) exhibits effective surface morphology of the GQD incorporated BHJ film compared to the pristine BHJ film due to the smaller height variation of surface morphology. Hence, the favorable morphology and phase separation of the BHJ film in terms of the well dispersed GQDs induced an enhanced current density with high carrier conductivity and possibly efficient light absorptivity through the BHJ domains, thereby affecting not only the resistance parameters but also improving light harvesting at the BHJ solar cells.

Furthermore, the increased current density with an enhanced EQE implies that more light is harvested in the small molecule BHJ film because of multiple reflection from light scattering by the GQDs. We could neglect the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect on the GQDs from the optical simulation of the E-field intensity distribution of the GQD obtained by the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method in Fig. S3.†37 Thus, the improvement of the EQE is particularly related to the dominant light scattering and improved charge carrier harvesting efficiency. To confirm the role of GQDs in small molecule BHJ films, we recorded the diffuse reflectance spectra as shown in Fig. 5(a). Consequently, the smaller reflection at the device with GQDs indicates the higher light absorptivity of the incident light.

In order to understand the charge transport resistance for the BHJ layer, Nyquist plots were obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and using Z-View software as shown in Fig. 5(b). Because the GQD device and reference device had the same device structure, that of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/Al, the ohmic resistance values, which were strongly related to the interface resistance of both electrodes (the anode and cathode), were similar: 53.2 Ω for the GQD device, and 54.0 Ω for the reference device. Moreover, the similar shape and size of the lower resistance region of the semicircles for both devices implied that there were no differences in the interlayers, and in the interfaces between BHJ and the interlayer. However, the charge transport resistance in the BHJ layer with GQDs was significantly decreased by around 2 times, compared with the reference values (of 6050 Ω for the GQD device, and 12089 Ω for the reference device). Due to the outstanding charge conductance of GQDs,22 the charge transport resistance in the GQD embedded small molecule based BHJ layer was significantly reduced, thereby enhancing the charge carrier conductivity and extraction performance in the active layer.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we fabricated efficient solution-processed small molecule BHJ solar cells by the insertion of GQDs. The GQDs play an important role in increasing JSC and FF of the device due to induction of a favorable BHJ morphology and improved EQE. Furthermore, the multiple scattering of the GQDs in BHJ leads to longer optical pathlengths which give rise to improved light absorption by analysis of diffuse reflectance spectra. The GQD inserted small molecule based BHJ film also exhibits significantly reduced charge transport resistance from the impedance spectroscopy measurement. The combination of the factors, improved light absorption and effective charge conduction, leads to high efficiency solution processed small molecule solar cells.
