    , Accepted 22nd October 2018First published on 24th October 2018AbstractBased on first-principles calculations, we propose a new type of two-dimensional (2D) material M2C3 (M = As, Sb, and Bi) showing an infinite hexagonal lattice, in which C atoms adopt sp2 hybridization and M atoms prefer three-fold coordination with lone pair electrons. Such monolayers are calculated to be stable verified by their moderate cohesive energies, the absence of imaginary modes in their phonon spectra, and the high melting points predicted via molecular dynamics simulations. Sb2C3 and Bi2C3 monolayers possess intrinsic band gaps of 1.58 and 1.23 eV (based on HSE06 calculations), values suitable for photovoltaic applications. The intrinsic acoustic-phonon-limited carrier mobility of the As2C3 sheet can reach up to 4.45 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons at room temperature, higher than that of (60–200 cm2 V−1 s−1) MoS2 and (∼103 cm2 V−1 s−1) few-layer phosphorene, approaching the figure of merit in graphene (3 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1). The well-located band edge and visible light absorption make stretched Sb2C3 a potentially promising optoelectronic material for photocatalytic water splitting. Besides, Sb2C3/As2C3 excitonic solar cells have been proposed, and their power conversion efficiencies are estimated to exceed 23%. First-principles calculations have demonstrated that Sb2C3/Bi2C3 heterojunctions are indeed 2D node-line semimetals in the absence of spin–orbit coupling.
1 Introduction
Since the mechanical cleavage method for exfoliating graphene from graphite in 2004,1 materials with ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) structures have attracted much attention.2–6 With one atom thickness but a very large lateral area, graphene shows novel structure-related properties, e.g., massless Dirac fermions,1 high electron/hole mobility,7 superconductivity with proper doping,8 ballistic electronic propagation,9 and the quantum Hall effect.10 However, the trait of zero band gap in pristine graphene greatly hampers its potential applications in modern electronics although its mobility is ultra-high. Beyond graphene, MoS2 is another important 2D material with a finite band gap,11,12 but its carrier mobility is relatively low (60–200 cm2 V−1 s−1).13 In this context, phosphorene, atomically thin phosphorus exfoliated from black phosphorus, seems to be an ideal candidate due to its inherent direct band gap (2.0 eV) and high hole mobility (of the order 103 cm2 V−1 s−1).14,15 However, few-layer phosphorene-based devices are environmentally-vulnerable when exposed to air and can only be used in an inert atmosphere.16,17 Thus, it is necessary to explore new potential 2D materials, which have not only controlled finite band gaps but also high carrier mobility.
Among the well-known 2D materials, elemental carbon and phosphorus have been studied extensively as both can experimentally and theoretically form stable 2D allotropes.1,14,15,18–20 Recently, theoretical studies have beautifully provided evidence of the existence of monolayer PC allotropes,21–26 which can show metallic properties with superconductivity,26 semimetallic properties with an anisotropic Dirac cone, or semiconducting properties with superior carrier mobility depending on the configuration and ratio. Subsequently, few-layer black PC has been successfully synthesized27–29 and its field-effect transistor exhibits a high hole mobility of 1995 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature.27 Black PC could also be a tunable anisotropic plasmonic metasurface which provides a viable platform for hyperbolic metamaterials, bringing widespread application in biosensors, single-photon sources, nanoantennae, and subwavelength resolution imaging.29 These results have shown that good semiconducting behavior can be induced in 2D phosphorus carbide nanomaterials.
Antimonene30 and bismuthene,31 belonging to the same group V family as phosphorene, have been successfully synthesized experimentally and show tremendous electro-optical properties. Besides, several theoretical predictions have successfully guided the syntheses of some 2D materials, such as silicene,32,33 Janus TMDCs,34,35 Cu2Si sheets,36,37 borophene,38–40 and blue phosphorene.41–43 It is intriguing to find out whether the binary compounds of C and M (M = As, Sb, and Bi) also form stable 2D monolayers and possess superior properties. Based on ab initio calculations, we propose a novel family of 2D carbides M2C3 with hexagonal lattices containing C and M atoms. Phonon spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations provide compelling evidence for the thermal and dynamical stabilities of M2C3 monolayers. Remarkably, we find that M2C3 monolayers are intrinsic semiconductors with band gaps of 2.27, 1.53, and 1.28 eV for As2C3, Sb2C3, and Bi2C3, respectively, using state-of-the art hybrid density functional calculations. The As2C3 monolayer possesses a relatively high electron mobility of up to 4.45 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is larger than that of the MoS2 monolayer and phosphorene. Our results have demonstrated that the work function of strained Sb2C3 can well satisfy the energetic requirements of the reduction and oxidation processes for water splitting. The hexagonal structures, appropriate band gaps, high carrier mobility, desirable band edge positions, and high optical absorption suggest M2C3 monolayers could be promising materials for next-generation high-performance devices.
2 Computational methods
First-principles calculations were performed within the framework of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)44 generalized gradient approximation,45,46 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package.47,48 The plane-wave basis sets of 500 eV were set with 0.03 Å−1 spacing in the Monkhorst–Pack scheme for structure optimization, and denser k-point grids with 0.01 Å−1 spacing for property calculation. The length of the unit cell (20 Å) along the z direction was used to get rid of the interaction between adjacent images. All geometry structures were fully relaxed until the residual forces on each atom were less than 0.01 eV Å−1 and the total energy variation was less than 1.0 × 10−6 eV. The screened exchange hybrid density functional by Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)49,50 was adopted to further correct the electronic structure. To verify the stability of the system at elevated temperatures, AIMD simulations were performed using the Nosé algorithm51 in the NVT ensemble at high temperatures.
The phonon calculations were carried out within the harmonic approximation via the force-constant method52 as implemented in the PHONOPY code.53 The orbital-resolved phonon spectra were calculated by postprocessing phonon eigenvalues on the basis of the phononic k·p theorem54,55 (1)where ek,σ*(j) was the displacement of the atom j in the eigenvector of the (k,σ) vibrational mode, and Δ was a small wave vector.
The positions of the valence-band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) were defined as (2)where EBGC was the band gap center energy calibrated with respect to the vacuum level.56
To obtain the optical absorption spectra of M2C3 monolayers, the imaginary part of the frequency-dependent dielectric function was calculated from the interband transition in the independent-particle picture without including the local field effects using the following equation:57 (3)The real part of the dielectric function ε1 was obtained by the Kramers–Kronig transformation. Then the optical absorption coefficients α(ω) were evaluated according to the following equation (where c is the speed of light in a vacuum)58,59 (4)
The carrier mobility was obtained in the framework of deformation potential (DP) theory on the basis of the effective mass approximation.60 The analytical expression of acoustic-phonon-limited carrier mobility in 2D materials can be defined as follows:61–64 (5)where m* was the effective mass in the transport direction, e was the electron charge, T was the temperature (300 K), E1 was the DP constant, and C2D was the 2D elastic modulus.
3 Results and analysis
3.1 Structures of M2C3
The geometric configuration of monolayers of M2C3 is shown in Fig. 1a. They all share a honeycomb 2D form with a high group symmetry of P6/mmm (No. 191). In the structures, the lattice parameter (la) obtained from ab initio calculations was 5.86, 6.39, and 6.70 Å for As2C3, Sb2C3, and Bi2C3, respectively (Table 1). There was one unique M (M = As, Sb, and Bi) atom (site symmetry 4h) and one independent C atom (site symmetry 6i) in the primitive cell. The 2D structure contained the planar sp2 bonding characteristic of graphene and the significantly different nonplanar sp3 bonding feature found in 2D monoelemental arsenene,65 antimonene,30 and bismuthene.31 The C–C bond length was 1.33 Å for the three monolayers, which lies close to the value (1.42 Å) in sp2 bonded graphite (or graphene).1 All M atoms were trigonally coordinated to ambient C atoms via quasi sp3-hybridization bonding. As shown in Table 1, due to the atom effective radii of M atoms, the M–C bond lengths display an increasing trend with the following order: As2C3 (2.00 Å) < Sb2C3 (2.20 Å) < Bi2C3 (2.31 Å). From the top view of the lattices, the M2C3 sheets can be viewed as an enlarging of arsenene,65 antimonene,30 and bismuthene31 with the inserting of C atoms into the 2D networks.64 Thus, the M2C3 sheets had periodically distributed pores of 5.86, 6.39, and 6.70 Å diameter, for As2C3, Sb2C3, and Bi2C3, respectively, which were equal to their corresponding lattice constants, suggesting potential applications in gas separation and storage.

3.2 Stabilities of M2C3
To confirm the stability of M2C3, we have computed the cohesive energy (Ecoh) with respect to the isolated atoms, defined as (6)where EM2C3, EM, and EC are the total energy of a M2C3 sheet, single M atom, and single C atom, respectively; nM and nC are the numbers of M or C atoms per unit cell. The calculated cohesive energies of M2C3 sheets are −5.16, −4.89, and −4.66 eV per atom for As2C3, Sb2C3, and Bi2C3, respectively (Table 1). For comparison, the cohesive energies we calculated, for graphene,1 silicene,33 black phosphorene,14,15 arsenene,65 antimonene,30 and bismuthene,31 at the same theoretical level, were −7.85, −3.83, −3.48, −2.97, −2.64, and −2.46 eV per atom, respectively. It is obvious that the cohesive energies of M2C3 are lower than the majority of the well-known 2D materials, which means that the experimental synthesis may be achieved with appropriate substrates.
The orbital-resolved phonon spectra and projected phonon density of states (PhDOS) for As2C3 (Sb2C3 and Bi2C3) are shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. S1 (ESI†). For a crystal, its potential energy Φ is an analytic function of the displacements (r) of the atoms.66 When the optimized structure locates at the minimum on a potential-energy-surface, the potential energy always increases against any combinations of atomic displacements. More specifically, a dynamically stable crystal must satisfy the requirement, . The real frequencies of all modes in the Brillouin Zone (BZ) indicate that the three 2D crystals are all kinetically stable.67,68 The acoustic branches of As2C3 show a ubiquitous phenomenon in low-dimensional systems with a parabolic dispersion longitudinal acoustic mode and two linear dispersions transverse modes at the Γ point.54,55,69 The colours of the phonon spectra are weighted by the contributions of As and C atoms, which clearly show that the vibration modes, in the low-energy region below ∼10 THz, are mainly from As atoms while the C atoms dominate remanent vibration modes. More specifically from PhDOS, the phonon mode mainly contains As (z) vibrations especially around 0 THz, while the contributions from hybridizations of As (xy), As (z), and C (xy) vibrations become larger when moving from 0 to 10 THz. In the 10 to 25 THz energy region, the main components can be primarily derived from the C (xy) vibrations. The high-energy region from 44 to 49 THz is totally from C (z) vibrations, which is corresponding to that of the C (xy) vibrations in pristine graphene.69 The feature of sp2 bonding of C and sp3 bonding of As (Sb and Bi) helps to stabilize the 2D geometry.
To check the mechanical stability of M2C3 sheets, we have calculated the linear elastic constants based on Hooke's law through the energy–stress relationship.70 The calculated 2D elastic constants are C11 = 97.12, 73.53, and 58.58 N m−1, C12 = 28.77, 24.03, and 19.92 N m−1, and C66 = 34.15, 24.78, and 19.41 N m−1 for As2C3, Sb2C3, and Bi2C3, respectively. These values meet the requirements of the stability criteria for 2D structures in the hexagonal class,64,71e.g. C11 > |C12| and C66 > 0. The in-plane axial Young’s moduli (E = (C112 − C122)/C11) were 88.56, 65.68, and 51.81 N m−1, which are much lower than that of graphene (340 N m−1)72 and MoS2 (123 N m−1),73 but in the same order of magnitude as silicene (62.31 N m−1).74 The calculated Poisson's ratios for M2C3 are 0.296, 0.327, and 0.340 for As2C3, Sb2C3, and Bi2C3, respectively, which are similar to those (0.16–0.59) of monolayer honeycomb structures of group-IV elements and III–V binary compounds.75
The thermal stability of M2C3 sheets has been examined by carrying out AIMD simulations51 at 1000 and 2000 K for 5 ps. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the structural integrity of M2C3 is well retained and can be optimized back to their initial structures via ab initio relaxation calculations after the simulation at 1000 K. The compounds thoroughly degrade and the atomic configurations show serious distortion at 2000 K. Thus the three monolayers can maintain a stable 2D form at least up to 1000 K, which suggests good thermal stability at high temperature.
3.3 Chemical bonding and electronic structure
The electron localization function (ELF)76 can provide a good description of electron localization and chemical bonding character in solids. To highlight the bonds of C–C and M–C, the isosurfaces of ELF maps visualized by different colours were calculated and are plotted in Fig. 2 using VESTA software.77 For M2C3 sheets, the electrons are well localized around the M atoms and the bonds of C–C, implying that C atoms adopt the favoured planar sp2-hybridization and M atoms prefer the nonplanar sp3-hybridization with lone pair electrons, which is common in graphene and arsenene/antimonene/bismuthene monolayers.30,31,65
 Fig. 2  ELF maps sliced perpendicular to the (001) direction for (a) As2C3, (b) Sb2C3, and (c) Bi2C3. In the ELF maps, red and blue refer to the highest (1.0) and lowest (0.0) values of ELF, indicating a fully localized electron region and a low electron density area, respectively. 
The orbital-resolved band structures and projected density of states (PDOS) of As2C3, Sb2C3, and Bi2C3 monolayers are shown in Fig. 3. Obviously, As2C3 and Sb2C3 are indirect band gap semiconductors since the VBM is located at the Γ point whereas the CBM lies at the K point. Monolayer Bi2C3 has a direct PBE band gap of 0.81 eV, which is lower than that of As2C3 (1.42 eV) and Sb2C3 (0.92 eV) at the same computing level. Refined calculations based on the HSE06 method49,50 give enlarged gaps of 2.27, 1.53, and 1.28 eV for As2C3, Sb2C3, and Bi2C3 monolayers, respectively. From the orbital-resolved band structures, one can see that the bands in the vicinity of the Fermi level mainly originate from the hybridization of M and C atomic orbitals. The PDOS analysis further revealed that the edges of the valence bands are dominated by the p orbitals of M atoms hybridized with visible contributions from the C-p orbitals, while the conduction band edges are mainly coming from the C-p orbitals and partly from the M-p orbitals. The contributions from other orbitals could be almost negligible for M2C3 sheets around the Fermi level. The corresponding real-space charge distributions of the VBM and CBM are shown in Fig. 3. The valence bands at the Γ point are mainly contributed to by M-pz orbitals with indispensable components from C-px,y orbitals for As2C3 and Sb2C3 while the VBM of Bi2C3 is mainly from M-px,y and C-px,y orbitals. The distributions of the CBM for the three monolayers are mainly characterized by the hybridized bonding and antibonding bands of C-pz and M-px,y orbitals. Meanwhile, the C-pz orbital characteristic of the CBM weakens on going from As2C3 and Sb2C3 to Bi2C3 with the increasing mass of the M atoms.

3.4 Band edges and optical properties
The calculations with an HSE06 function revealed that the band gaps of M2C3 all exceeded the free energy of water splitting of 1.23 eV. Additionally, for a 2D semiconductor to facilitate photocatalytic water-splitting, the CBM energy must be higher than the reduction potential of H+/H2 (−4.44 eV) while the VBM energy must be lower than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O (−5.67 eV).78 In recent years, intensive efforts have been devoted to addressing this issue via first-principles frameworks, including in a series of work by the Hybertson group79 and Galli group.80 They promise to be more accurate for the electronic screening based on quasiparticle correction and explicit modeling of interface heterostructures. Herein, on the basis of the HSE06 method,49,50 we have calculated the band edges of M2C3 with respect to the vacuum level (Fig. 4 and Fig. S3, ESI†).56 Comparing the band edge positions of single-layer M2C3 with the redox potentials of hydrogen evolution (H+/H2) and oxygen evolution (O2/H2O) at pH = 0, we find that the pristine M2C3 monolayers are not suitable for photocatalytic water splitting.

The reduction potential of H+/H2 and the oxidation potential of O2/H2O are marked by the red and blue dashed lines, respectively. The CBM and VBM band edge positions are marked by the solid black lines. (a, b and c) are for the pristine and strained (a) As2C3, (b) Sb2C3, and (c) Bi2C3 within a strain range from −6% to 6% based on HSE06 level. The energy gaps of semiconductor photocatalysts are marked by the black arrows (solid: direct band gap; dotted: indirect band gap). Strain-dependent optical absorption coefficients α(ω) for (d) As2C3, (e) Sb2C3, and (f) Bi2C3 based on HSE06 level. The seven-colour light area between the dashed lines represents the visible light range (380–780 nm). 
Since a 2D film must eventually be deposited or grown on a substrate for device application, it is quite crucial to check the effects of strain on the band gaps and band edge positions for M2C3. Using the HSE06 method,49,50 we applied biaxial strains in the range from −6% to +6% to relax atomic positions and obtain the corresponding CBM and VBM from the relaxed configurations (Fig. 4).59 Over large regions of strain, the CBM and VBM levels depend linearly on strain. However, for the three materials we observed that the slope changes abruptly at certain strains due to the change of band edge positions, which induce a transition between an indirect and a direct band gap phase for M2C3. When stretching M2C3, we can see that only the band edges of Sb2C3 are appropriate for initializing photocatalytic redox reactions of water.
Besides the above criteria, a photocatalyst must have excellent optical absorption mainly in the visible region with wavelengths of 380–780 nm.56 The calculated optical spectra with polarization vectors parallel to the layer plane for M2C3 as a function of photon energy are shown in Fig. 4. It is seen that As2C3 shows significant ultraviolet light absorption, while Sb2C3 and Bi2C3 show substantial absorption for both visible light and ultraviolet light, suggesting highly efficient utilization of solar radiation. Moreover, the average absorption intensities in the visible light region of Sb2C3 are very strong with values of more than 104 cm−1, which are superior to that of the famous 2D g-C3N4 photocatalyst.81 For the effects of biaxial strain on the optical properties of M2C3, the calculated results indicate that the negative strain will significantly affect the absorption coefficients of Sb2C3 and Bi2C3 in the form of red shift while the positive strain has little influence on these. Within a strain range of −6% to 6%, monolayer Sb2C3 exhibits strong absorption in the visible-light range.
3.5 Carrier mobilities of M2C3
The carrier mobility of M2C3 has been calculated on the basis of the DP theory proposed by Bardeen and Shockley,60 which has been widely used for investigating the electronic transport properties of 2D atomic layered structures.61–64,82 The E1, C2D, m*, μ and relaxation time (τ = μm*/e) are summarized in Table 2. The effective mass m* of holes was 1.037, 0.706, and 0.549 me for As2C3, Sb2C3, and Bi2C3 monolayers, respectively. On the other hand, the effective mass m* of electrons was 0.581, 0.477, and 0.464 me for As2C3, Sb2C3, and Bi2C3 monolayers, respectively. These values are much larger than those of phosphorene (0.15 and 0.17 me for holes and electrons along the Γ–X direction),83 2D SnSe (0.13 and 0.16 me for holes and electrons),84 h-BX (X = P, As, and Sb) (0.04–0.18 me),85 α-PC (0.12 and 0.10 me for holes and electrons along the X direction),22 and β-PC (0.05 me along the X direction),22 but in the same order of magnitude as MoS2 (0.46–0.60 me)61 and GeP3 (0.55–0.80 me).86 The obtained deformation potentials (E1) for electrons were 0.096, 0.339, and 0.714 eV for As2C3, Sb2C3, and Bi2C3 monolayers (Fig. S4, ESI†), respectively, which are much smaller than the corresponding E1 of holes (0.888, 1.708, and 3.850 eV). They are much smaller than those of other 2D materials which have values in the range 3.7–5.0 eV.22,61,83,84,86 These small values can be unraveled by the real-space charge distribution of the VBM and CBM shown in Fig. 3d–f, where the wavefunctions from p orbitals are extremely robust due to the bonding of sp2-hybridization from the C atoms and the isolation of lone pair electrons from M atoms.

The 2D in-plane stiffness (C2D) of As2C3, Sb2C3, and Bi2C3 monolayers was calculated to be 97.04, 73.57, and 58.45 N m−1 (Fig. S5, ESI†), respectively, which was larger than that of phosphorene (28.94 N m−1 along the Γ–X direction)83 and smaller than that of MoS2 (127.44 N m−1)61 and phosphorene (101.60 N m−1 along the Γ–Y direction).83 The decrease of C2D for M2C3 shows that the interaction of M and C atoms becomes weak from As to Sb to Bi. The obtained acoustic-phonon-limited carrier mobility for electrons was 4.45 × 105, 4.01 × 104, and 7.57 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 for As2C3, Sb2C3, and Bi2C3, respectively. The hole mobility was found to be much smaller than that for electrons with values of 1.63 × 103, 7.20 × 102, and 1.86 × 102 cm2 V−1 s−1. The differences between electron and hole mobility can be mainly ascribed to the different deformation potentials and effective masses in M2C3. It can be seen that the obtained electron mobility of 4.45 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 for As2C3 is larger than that of the MoS2 monolayer (60–200 cm2 V−1 s−1),61 few-layer black phosphorus (∼103 cm2 V−1 s−1),83 and graphene (3.38 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1).87 Meanwhile, the ratio of electron and hole mobility was 273.0, 55.7, and 40.7 for As2C3, Sb2C3, and Bi2C3, respectively. Such large disparity can be used to separate electrons and holes,88 thus further reducing carrier recombination rates.
3.6 vdW heterojunctions of M2C3
Deduced from the above analysis, the band gaps of Sb2C3 and Bi2C3 were 1.53 and 1.28 eV, respectively, which makes these monolayers promising solar-cell absorption materials.89 For the Sb2C3 monolayer, we find theoretically that n-As2C3/p-Sb2C3 vdW heterojunctions (Fig. S6 and Table S1, ESI†) are direct-band-gap semiconductors characterized with typical type-II band alignment (Fig. 5, and Fig. S7–S10, ESI†) with high thermal stability (Fig. S11, ESI†), which could facilitate the effective separation of photogenerated electron and hole pairs and therefore become good candidates for next-generation solar cells.90,91 The practical upper limit of the power conversion efficiency (η) for studying solar cells can be estimated in the limit of 100% external quantum efficiency as below:92,93 (7)where 0.65 is the fill factor (βFF), P(ħϖ) is the AM1.5 solar energy flux at the photo energy (ħϖ), ΔEc is the conduction band offset, Joc is the maximum open circuit voltage, and Jsc is an integration in the limit external quantum efficiency of 100%. The efficient n-As2C3/p-Sb2C3 heterojunctions could have a power conversion efficiency (η) exceeding ∼23%, which is comparable with g-SiC2 based systems,94 AlxC based heterobilayers,95 and phosphorene/MoS2 systems.96

(c) Power conversion efficiency as a function of the donor band gap and conduction band offset. The red stars mark η of AA-stacking and AB-stacking Sb2C3/As2C3. (d) 3D representation of the band structure which shows the node-line around the K point for AA-stacking Sb2C3/Bi2C3. (e) The resolved band structure of AB-stacking Sb2C3/Bi2C3 heterojunctions. The colors of band structures are weighted by the contribution from the Sb2C3 (blue) and Bi2C3 (red) monolayers. 
For the Sb2C3/Bi2C3 heterojunctions (Fig. S6 and Table S1, ESI†), first-principles calculations show that they are indeed 2D node-line semimetals97 in the absence of spin–orbit coupling (Fig. 5, Fig. S7 and S12, ESI†). It can be clearly seen that the Sb2C3 and Bi2C3 orbitals overlap around the K point and the orbital characters exchange after passing through the band crossing points, indicating an intrinsic band inversion from the formation of a heterojunction. To clearly show the node-line natures of the Sb2C3/Bi2C3 heterojunctions, we have calculated 3D band structures in the whole BZ using a two-dimension wave vector mesh. It is obvious that the conduction band and valence band meet at a circle centered at the K point rather than isolated points, exhibiting features of node-line semimetals similar to other 2D monolayers, such as MX (M = Pd and Pt; X = S, Se, and Te) monolayers,97 honeycomb-kagome Hg3As2,98 and line-centered square Be2C.99
4 Conclusions
In summary, we theoretically identify the existence of two-dimensional (2D) materials M2C3 (M = As, Sb, and Bi) with an infinite hexagonal lattice. In the structure, each C atom adopts sp2 hybridization with one C atom and two M atoms, while M atoms retain the sp3 hybridization character with lone pair electrons. Calculated results indicate that As2C3, Sb2C3 and Bi2C3 are intrinsic semiconductors with band gaps of 2.27, 1.58 and 1.23 eV. The room-temperature electron mobility of the As2C3 sheet is calculated to be 4.45 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher that of graphene (3 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1). The well-located band edge and visible light absorption make strained Sb2C3 monolayer a potentially promising optoelectronic material for photocatalytic water splitting. Besides, Sb2C3/As2C3 heterojunction solar cells have power conversion efficiencies exceeding ∼23%, while Bi2C3/Sb2C3 heterojunctions possess features of 2D node-line band structures in momentum space in the absence of SOC. Our results highlight the unique electronic and structural properties of a new family of 2D materials and are expected to guide future studies toward experimental realization of efficient photoelectric applications based on these binary materials.

The energy gaps of semiconductor photocatalysts are marked by the black arrows (solid: direct band gap; dotted: indirect band gap). Strain-dependent optical absorption coefficients α(ω) for (d) As2C3, (e) Sb2C3, and (f) Bi2C3 based on HSE06 level. The seven-colour light area between the dashed lines represents the visible light range (380–780 nm).

 	Fig. 5  (a) Schematic drawing of an interface between As2C3 and Sb2C3 monolayers. (b) Band offsets between As2C3 and Sb2C3 monolayers for AB-stacking Sb2C3/As2C3 based on the HSE06 method. (c) Power conversion efficiency as a function of the donor band gap and conduction band offset. The red stars mark η of AA-stacking and AB-stacking Sb2C3/As2C3. (d) 3D representation of the band structure which shows the node-line around the K point for AA-stacking Sb2C3/Bi2C3. (e) The resolved band structure of AB-stacking Sb2C3/Bi2C3 heterojunctions. The colors of band structures are weighted by the contribution from the Sb2C3 (blue) and Bi2C3 (red) monolayers.
