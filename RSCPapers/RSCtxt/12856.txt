    , Accepted 27th April 2020First published on 27th April 2020AbstractThree naphthodithiophene (NDT)-based small molecules, bearing hexyl- (NDT-Hex), null (NDT) and fluorene (NDT-F) substituents at the β-position of the thiophene vertically conjugated to the NDT core, were designed and synthesized. The photovoltaic effect of engineered NDT molecules was investigated with a detailed characterization of optical absorption, electronic energy levels, blend morphology, carrier mobility and photovoltaic performance. It shows that the hexyl-substitution enhances the morphological tunability for NDT molecules, which contributes to achieving a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) with high fill factor (FF). The optimized solar cells based on NDT-Hex:PC71BM blends provide a PCE of 6.7% with an FF of 0.717 and it reaches 8.6% with an FF of 0.638 if a non-fullerene molecular acceptor, NBDTP-Fout, is adopted to blend with NDT-Hex. Both FF are among the top values for the respective kinds of solar cells based on an NDT small molecule. The work demonstrates a feasible morphology-tuning method toward efficient organic solar cells with high FF.
Introduction
As a feasible solution for inexpensive renewable energy sources, organic solar cells (OSCs) are attracting increasing attention from researchers concerning the energy shortage issue.1 Besides the advantages of low-cost synthesis,2 easy manufacturing of thin film devices,3 high potential for light-weight,4 large area and flexible applications,5 OSCs are also favoured for the easy-expansion of photoactive materials via chemical modification.6 Up to now, thousands of materials have been developed, including variable polymeric or small molecule donors, fullerene or non-fullerene molecular acceptors. Due to fast evolving material synthesis and device fabrication techniques, the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs proceed rapidly with benchmarks being continuously refreshed.7–17 To date, single-junction BHJ solar cells based on fullerene acceptors have reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of above 11%,18,19 using either polymeric or small molecule donor materials. The highest PCE for fullerene-based small molecule solar cells is achieved by using a medium bandgap molecule BTID-1.18 Though having the advantages of molecular purification and batch variation, the overall performance of small molecule solar cells comparatively lags behind their polymeric counterparts. Noticeably, promoted by the rapidly evolving non-fullerene molecular acceptors, single junction BHJ polymer solar cells have achieved an impressive PCE of around 18%.20 However, such a strategy is not well suited for small molecule systems and the maximal PCE of non-fullerene small molecule solar cells remained around 13–14%.21–23 Further development of small molecule solar cells would rely highly on the rational design for both donor and acceptor materials and the good matching between them. As currently most efficient non-fullerene molecule acceptors14,24–26 are of low-bandgap type, donor materials of medium/wide-bandgaps27 would inherently be spectrally matched. Therefore, developing medium/large bandgap small molecule donor materials is important, and requires in-depth investigation.
As an important constituent of the acenedithiophene family, organic semiconductors incorporating a naphthodithiophene (NDT) core have widely been used as polymer donors, small molecule donors, and even non-fullerene molecular acceptors.28–34 Taking NDT as the core segment offers several advantages for constructing effective photovoltaic materials, such as: (a) the easy functionalization at the α-position of thiophenes, which extends the diversity of the designed molecule; (b) the integration of thiophene with naphthalene rigidifies the planarity, which facilitates the π-electron delocalization while enhancing the π–π stacking and favors the charge transport; and (c) the facile alkylation on the naphthalene unit which eases the tuning on solubility and molecular orientation. Of good transporting properties, NDTs were favored for thick-film devices and roll-to-roll or other scalable techniques. Recent work with ∼8% PCE at a thickness of ∼300 nm has been reported, which utilizes a naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene polymer donor.29 However, for small molecule solar cells based on NDT donors, encouraging PCEs were rarely reported. Moreover, we noted that the fill factor (FF) for all NDT-based solar cells, was relatively low (<0.7). As most NDTs show high mobility (10−2–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), we infer that the underdeveloped blending morphology should be accountable.35–37 A distinct correlation between the structural factors of NDT molecules and their blending morphology, photovoltaic parameters, etc., urges a clear clarification, which should benefit the research on organic solar cells.
In this manuscript, a morphology-tuning strategy for photovoltaic blends via pendant group engineering on molecule donors, was demonstrated, which contains three molecular donors, NDT-Hex, NDT and NDT-F, all taking a naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene core with the main structural difference being the substituents at the β-position of the thiophene ring vertically conjugated to the core. The molecule structure of three NDTs are shown in Fig. 1. All molecules are of similar bandgaps and electrochemical energy levels, yet behave differently on morphology-tuning of their photovoltaic blends. When blended with PC71BM, only NDT-Hex shows a positive response to the SVA treatment by an increase in PCE. For the others, their PCEs were both decreased after SVA. Such variation is assumed to be in correlation with the changed aggregation behavior of NDT donors due to pendant group engineering, as confirmed by detailed morphological investigation. After device optimization, the superior NDT-Hex molecule achieves a PCE of 6.7% when it blends with PC71BM and the PCE boosts to 8.6% when an NBDTP-Fout38 molecular acceptor is adopted to fabricate BHJ OSCs. Notably, both FFs of the optimal devices are impressively high, reaching 71.7% and 63.8% respectively, both among the top values for NDT-based small molecule solar cells to date, regardless of adopting fullerene acceptors or non-fullerene ones, to the best of our knowledge.

Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of NDT-Hex, NDT and NDT-F are shown in Scheme S1 in the ESI† with general characterization details (1H NMR, 13C NMR, mass spectra) also provided. All precursors were prepared according to the published procedures with the final products synthesized via Stille-coupling. The normalized ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) optical absorption spectra of three materials in solution (chloroform) and film states are shown in Fig. 2. The NDT-Hex, NDT and NDT-F molecules exhibit similar absorption in solution with maximal peaks appearing at 606 nm, 600 nm and 600 nm, respectively. Though their film absorptions are also similar, the relative strengths of the shoulder peak to the main one for three films were different, which suggests a varied packing state of molecules in the solid state. The optical bandgaps are estimated to be 1.78 eV, 1.77 eV and 1.79 eV for NDT-Hex, NDT and NDT-F respectively, using calculations based on the onsets of film absorption. The frontier orbital energy levels of three NDTs were determined by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels for NDT-Hex, NDT and NDT-F are −5.46/−3.57, −5.40/−3.55 and −5.41/−3.59 eV respectively, using measurements taking a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as the external standard (Table 1 and Fig. S1, ESI†). Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted to evaluate the thermal stability of three materials. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), all molecules have good thermal stability with characteristic decomposition temperatures (Td) appearing at 337.9, 367.4 and 358.5 °C, respectively.

Photovoltaic performance
BHJ solar cells were fabricated in a conventional device structure (glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:PC71BM/Ca/Al) and measured at AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 simulated solar irradiation. Fig. 3a shows the J–V curves of NDT-Hex:PC71BM, NDT:PC71BM and NDT-F:PC71BM devices under optimal conditions with detailed parameters summarized in Table 2. The three devices show similar optimal values in D/A blend ratio (all around 1:1.7) and active layer thickness (all around 70 nm). However, their response to SVA treatment were much different. The device based on NDT molecular donor exhibits a large Voc up to 0.926 V with moderate Jsc (7.05 mA cm−2) and FF (0.653). Comparatively, substituting the β-H of thiophene vertically linked to the NDT core either by a hexyl group or an F atom contributes to an increase of Voc. The F-substituted molecule (NDT-F) obtains a Voc up to 1.02 V, showing a ∼94 mV increase compared to the reference donor NDT. Similarly, the hexyl-substituted NDT-Hex obtains a Voc of 0.956 V, showing a ∼30 mV increase compared to NDT. As introducing an electron-donating unit generally elevates the energy level and decreases the Voc of devices, this Voc increase is interesting. The most tremendous change by hexyl substitution is in Jsc. Unlike the reduction in the NDT-F device, the NDT-Hex device obtains a much increased Jsc up to 10.19 mA cm−2, increased by nearly 50% compared to the NDT one. Their EQE curves show similar trends. The maximal EQEs of NDT-Hex, NDT, and NDT-F devices are 57.2% (580 nm), 40.5% (580 nm) and 26.9% (580 nm), which contribute to an integrated Jsc of 9.95, 6.73 and 4.19 mA cm−2, respectively. As only NDT-Hex shows a positive response to the SVA treatment, further device optimization was conducted based on this material. Detailed optimization of NDT-Hex:PC71BM solar cells involves a fine control over the SVA conditions and the selection of appropriate electron transporting layers (ETLs). To brief the analysis, only data presenting the optimal result were cited below and the other details are in the ESI.†

Fig. 4 shows the typical J–V and EQE curves of the NDT-Hex:PC71BM device by SVA and ETL optimization with photovoltaic parameters given in Table 2. The volume of SVA solvent, the duration time of SVA, the concentration of the NDT-Hex:PC71BM blend and ETL layers are the main influencing factors, which were optimized to be 35 μL (CF), 60 s, 8 mg mL−1 and FPI. The optimal device achieves a PCE of 6.70%, with a Voc of 0.954 V, a Jsc of 9.78 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.717. Integrating its EQE curve produces a calculated Jsc of 9.26 mA cm−2, which fits well with the measured one. Noticeably, the FF of the device increases by 20% via optimization, which records the NDT-based small molecular solar cells incorporating fullerene acceptors, to the best of our knowledge.

The high FF of solar cells may correlate with the effective extraction of charge carriers generated. To verify this we plotted the curve of neat photocurrent (Jph, defined as Jlight − Jdark, where Jlight and Jdark are the current densities under illumination and in the dark) versus the effective voltage applied (Veff, defined as V0 − Va, where V0 and Va are the voltage at Jph = 0 and the voltage applied, respectively)39 for the optimal device (Fig. 4c). The Jph reaches to a saturation state at a Veff value around 2.7 V, where all excitons were regarded to be fully dissociated and collected. The charge dissociation probability P(E,T) was determined to be 89.6% (Veff ∼ 1.07 V), by P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat under the short-circuit current conditions, which suggests efficient charge carrier extraction. The recombination behavior of NDT-Hex:PC71BM NDT solar cells was examined by plotting the Jsc–Plight curve of optimal devices (Fig. 4d). The relationship between Jsc and the incident light power (Plight) can be described as JSC ∝ PSlight,40 where the index S is viewed to be an indicator. The case of S = 1 reflects an ideal condition that all dissociated free carriers are swept out prior to recombination while that of S < 1 suggests the existence of charge recombination and the deviation of S from 1 reflects the severity of bimolecular recombination. In the optimal NDT-Hex:PC71BM device, the S value is 0.970, which suggests less bimolecular recombination.
The blend morphology of three donors with PC71BM was probed to investigate the effect of β-substitution on NDT molecules and trace the reason for the positive response of NDT-Hex to SVA as well as its achieved high FF. Fig. 5a–c shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of as-cast films of NDT-Hex:PC71BM, NDT:PC71BM and NDT-F:PC71BM blends. Both NDT:PC71BM and NDT-F:PC71BM films are largely phase-separated with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values reaching 6.835 nm and 6.181 nm respectively. In contrast, the NDT-Hex:PC71BM film shows a flat surface with a small RMS of 0.582 nm. Due to alleviated solvent permeation and swelling, the SVA treatment readily adjusts the molecules in solid films by promoting the relaxation of main- and/or side-chains which therefore refines the crystal regions and improves the molecule package. According to the reports, most NDT molecules are highly crystalline due to their large π-planarity. Apparently, both NDT and NDT-F molecules are of small steric hindrance compared with the hexyl-substituted one, which well preserves the π-planarity of NDT cores and thus increases the tendency of packing closely and promotes the formation of over-aggregated domains. In contrast, the β-substitution by a flexible hexyl unit enlarges the steric hindrance and breaks the π-planarity, which inhibits the close packing of NDT-Hex during the film formation process. Meanwhile, it helps to increase the solubility and improve the blending. Therefore, a well-miscible feature with small domains form in NDT-Hex:PC71BM blend films. More importantly, such a feature is favorable for further evolvement via SVA. As shown in Fig. 5d, the RMS of the NDT-Hex:PC71BM blend film after SVA boosts to 0.825 nm from the initial 0.582 nm of the as-cast film, which suggests the existence of better refined crystal regions. Such evolved blending morphology enables an increase for both hole and electron mobility. As shown in Table 3, a well-balanced charge transport is achieved by the NDT-Hex:PC71BM blend at the optimal SVA condition, which contributes to less bimolecular recombination. Therefore, the superior performance of hexyl-substituted NDT-Hex with appealingly high FF is due to effective charge extraction and balanced charge-transport with less bimolecular recombination.

To further examine the effect of engineered NDT molecules on achieving better FF for photovoltaic application, we fabricated non-fullerene solar cells by using an NDT-Hex donor and NBDTP-Fout molecular acceptor. Fig. 6 shows the molecular structure of NBDTP-Fout and its film absorption as well. Overlapping well with each other on the absorption spectrum, the NDT-Hex: NBDTP-Fout blend also achieves a fine blending morphology with a RMS roughness of 1.286 nm. As the J–V and EQE curves of optimal devices based on an NDT-Hex:NBDTP-Fout blend show, with active layers treated in a similar SVA way as that for NDT-Hex:PC71BM devices, the optimal NDT-Hex:NBDTP-Fout solar cell obtains a PCE of 8.61%, among the top values for non-fullerene OSCs incorporating NDT molecular donors.31 The slightly low FF compared to that of the NDT-Hex:PC71BM device may relate to the less balanced charge transport as NBDTP-Fout shows a smaller electron mobility (∼1.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1)38 than PC71BM (∼9.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).41 Despite that, the FF are still among the top ones for non-fullerene OSCs based on NDT molecular donors, to the best of our knowledge.30,31 This demo confirms that pendant group engineering over molecular donors is also an effective way to realize efficient PCE with high FF for non-fullerene solar cells.

Conclusions
Three NDT-cored molecular donors were designed and synthesized to investigate the effect of pedant group substitution at specific sites of photovoltaic donor materials. A subtle change of substituents at the β-position of the thiophene vertically conjugated to the NDT core dramatically alters the package in solid form, by influencing the morphological tunability for NDT molecule donors. The hexyl-substituted donor was proved to be the most effective. Under optimal conditions, the hexyl-substituted molecular donor NDT-Hex achieves a PCE of 6.7% with an FF reaching 71.7% by blending with PC71BM. Adopting a NBDTP-Fout molecular acceptor, the non-fullerene solar cell based on NDT-Hex reports a PCE of 8.61% with an FF of 63.8%, both among the top values for NDT-based small molecule solar cells, to the best of our knowledge. The work demonstrates an effective morphology tuning method by providing a feasible solution to achieving efficient organic solar cells with a high fill factor.
