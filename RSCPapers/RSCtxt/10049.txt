    , Accepted 21st March 2018First published on 22nd March 2018AbstractZnO as a promising electron transport layer (ETL) to TiO2 for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.9%; however, this is still lower than that obtained for TiO2-based PSCs (higher than 20%). Herein, we report the fabrication of high-efficiency methylammonium (MA) and Cs co-alloyed formamidinium (FA) triple cation perovskite based ZnO PSCs via delicate control of the cation compositions and annealing temperatures. By virtue of structural, morphological, spectral and electrochemical characterizations and analysis, we found that the incorporation of MA and Cs into FA perovskite enables the formation of a highly crystalline black phase perovskite with reduced surface roughness, which inhibits charge recombination and promotes electron transfer at the ZnO/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces and hence improves Jsc and FF values of the cell. As a result, the ZnO PSC based on MA0.1FA0.75Cs0.15PbI3 annealed at 110 °C achieved a PCE as high as 20.09%, exceeding the previous highest efficiency recorded for ZnO ETL based PSCs. The optimized MA0.1FA0.75Cs0.15PbI3 material demonstrated excellent reproducibility and long-term cell durability under ambient conditions within 1000 h. Particularly, the incorporation of a small amount of Br into the triple cation perovskite, i.e., MA0.1FA0.75Cs0.15PbI2.9Br0.1 led to a further enhancement in PCE of up to 20.44%, which is comparable with the best-performing MA and Cs-containing FA-based lead halide TiO2 PSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs), as an emerging star photovoltaic technology, have drawn enormous attention owing to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE), simple fabrication process and low manipulation cost.1–5 Organic–inorganic perovskite materials have an ABX3 structure, typically comprising an organic cation (A = methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3+); formamidinium (FA, CH3(NH2)2+), a divalent metal (B = Pb2+, Sn2+, and Ge2+), and a halogen anion (X = Cl−, Br−, and I−)). Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) with a band gap of 1.48 eV, which is closer to the optimum value of the single junction solar cell, exhibits broad light absorption range (typically with a peak absorption at ∼840 nm), good thermostability and reduced J–V hysteresis.6 Despite these attractive merits, pure FAPbI3-based PSCs have not achieved PCEs as high as those of conventional MAPbI3-based PSCs. This is because pure FAPbI3 with large radius of the FA cation (2.79 Å) lacks structural stability and also, the photoactive black perovskite phase (α-FAPbI3) can easily transform to a photoinactive yellow phase (δ-FAPbI3) at ambient temperature.7 As demonstrated in a previous report, the perovskite phase can only stabilize with the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) value within 0.8–1.0.8 However, the large radius of the FA cation makes the t-value larger than 1 for FAPbI3, resulting in the instability of the black perovskite α-phase.7 Alloying with smaller cations, such as cesium (Cs) (1.81 Å), MA (2.70 Å) or Cs + MA represents an efficient approach to reduce the t-value and then stabilize the FA-based perovskite structure to finally result in improved optoelectronic performance.7,9–13 Moreover, the incorporation of an inorganic cation, such as Cs and Rb, can both effectively reduce the crystallization temperature during the annealing process and improve the photo-moisture-stability of the pristine FAPbI3 perovskite.14–16
To date, the state-of-the-art FA-based PSCs mainly focus on a TiO2 nanoparticulate electron transport layer (ETL) and the PCEs of FA-MA-Cs triple-cation perovskite based devices have exceeded 20%.10,15 However, the fatal disadvantage of the TiO2 ETL is that a high-temperature annealing procedure (>450 °C) or alien element doping or interface modification is often required to enhance its crystallinity and electron transport, which severely limits its further commercial application in stretchable cell devices.15,17,18 In contrast, ZnO exhibits several distinct advantages over the commonly used TiO2 such as its facile low-temperature solution fabrication (<180 °C) of various nanostructures, high electron mobility and ease of tailoring its electrical and optical characteristics by manipulating its morphology and composition.19–22 Despite the merits of ZnO, the PCEs obtained for ZnO ETL-based PSCs have remained lower than 20%.23–25 A recent prominent progress in ZnO PSCs has been made by annealing FA-based triple cation perovskite at 95 °C with an impressive efficiency of 18.9%. Herein, it is worth noting that an optimal annealing temperature of over 100 °C for the full crystallization of photoactive FA-based perovskite is experimentally essential and this has also been demonstrated in high-efficiency TiO2 ETL-based PSCs. As such, we were motivated to fabricate highly crystalline multiple cation perovskite on ZnO ETL upon annealing at temperatures over 100 °C for purpose of attaining higher PCE as compared to that obtained for TiO2 ETL-based PSCs.
Considering that the annealing temperature of FA-based perovskite is predominantly composition-dependent, we herein report the preparation of a highly crystalline photoactive black phase perovskite film on low-temperature home-made ZnO ETL by delicately controlling the MA and Cs compositions as well as the annealing temperature. We found that the optimal perovskite, i.e., MA0.1FA0.75Cs0.15PbI3 annealed at 110 °C achieves a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.15 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 76.81% and PCE as high as 20.09%, which surpass the reported highest efficiency (18.9%) recorded for ZnO ETL based PSCs.26 Moreover, the MA0.1FA0.75Cs0.15PbI3 PSC was demonstrated to possess excellent reproducibility and long-term cell durability under ambient conditions within 1000 h. Various analyses confirmed that the photovoltaic performance enhancement in the MA0.1FA0.75Cs0.15PbI3-based device was mainly due to the decreased perovskite surface roughness, suppressed charge recombination and improved electron transfer at the ZnO/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces. Furthermore, we found that the incorporation of a small portion of Br into the optimized triple cation perovskite, i.e., MA0.1FA0.75Cs0.15PbI2.9Br0.1 can enhance the PCE to 20.44%, which is very close to the highest PCE of 22.1% reported for PSCs based on TiO2.10,15
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
All chemicals were used without further purification. The organic cation iodide salts were purchased from Dyesol and the CsI (99.999%) and PbI2 (99.9985%) were obtained from Aladdin. Spiro-OMeTAD (>99%) was acquired from Dyesol. Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, 99.95%), acetonitrile (99.8%) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All other organic solvents were obtained as analytical grade from J&K Chemical Ltd. and stored in sealed bottles with molecular sieves.
2.2 PSC device fabrication
The ITO/glass substrate (Xiang Sci. Tech. Co., 8 Ω m−2) was cleaned successively with acetone, detergent, deionized water, and isopropanol and finally treated under oxygen plasma for 20 min to remove the last trace of organic residues. A compact ZnO layer was deposited onto the ITO substrates by spin-coating [Zn(NH3)4](OH)2 under 2000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 10 min.
The desired solutions of FAPbI3, FA1−xCsxPbI3, MAyFA0.85−yCs0.15PbI3 and MA0.1FA0.75Cs0.15PbI2.9Br0.1 were prepared by the dissolution of the stoichiometric amounts of FAI, MAI, CsI, MABr and PbI2 in anhydrous DMSO at 60 °C for 12 h. The perovskite solution was spin coated in a two-step program at 1000 and 6000 rpm for 10 and 30 s, respectively. During the second step, 100 μL of chlorobenzene was poured onto the spinning substrate 3–6 s prior to the end of the program. The perovskite film was then annealed at 150 °C (FA system)/130 °C (FACs system)/110 °C (MAFACs system) for 5 min on a hot plate in a nitrogen filled glove box. The hole transport material (HTM) comprised of 72.3 mg of 2,29,7,70-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,99-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), 17.5 μL of bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt (LiTFSI, 99.95%)/acetonitrile (520 mg mL−1) and 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene (99.9%) was deposited onto the perovskite via spin-coating at 2500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the PSC device assembly was completed by thermal evaporation of a 70 nm-thick Ag electrode on the top of the HTM.
2.3 Device characterization
The morphology of the perovskite films and cross-sectional view of the PSCs were observed on a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL-6701F). Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurement was performed with an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer installed on a JEOL-6701F microscope. Atom force microscopy (AFM) images were recorded on a Bruker Metrology Nanoscope III-D atomic force microscope in tapping mode. The perovskite crystal structure was examined using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, D/max 2500 VB2þ/PC) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) operated at 40 mA and 40 kV. The light absorption properties of the perovskite/ZnO based films were investigated using UV-visible light absorption/diffused reflectance spectrometry (Lambda 950, PerkinElmer) in the 300–900 nm wavelength range at room temperature. Steady-state photoluminescence (SS-PL) was characterized at 790 nm after excitation at 470 nm using a Xenon lamp. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) was measured on a photoluminescent spectrometer (FLS 980, Edinburgh Instruments) using a picosecond pulsed diode laser CW NIR laser at 460 nm as the excitation source and measured at 790 nm. The TR-PL decay curves were fitted with the tri-exponential function as PL intensity = A + ΣBiexp(−t/τi) and the relative content (Ai) of each time constant τ was calculated using Ai = Biτi/(ΣBiτi). The photovoltaic performance of the PSCs was characterized by measuring the current–voltage curve under AM 1.5G sunlight with 100 mW cm−2 light output using a solar light simulator (Newport Oriel Sol 3A class, America, calibrated by a Newport reference cell) and the data were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter from 1.5 V to −0.5 V at a scan rate of 0.2 V s−1 and a pre-condition of 0.5 s. The cell size was 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm and the active area of each solar cell was 0.04 cm2, which was defined by the area of the Ag electrode. The long-term stability assessment of the solar cells under dark conditions was carried out by repeating the J–V characterization over various times. The devices without encapsulation were stored in the ambient environment with a relative humidity of 40–60%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was acquired using an Oriel model QE-PV-SI system equipped with a 300 W Xe lamp together with a calibrated silicon photodetector. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on a Zennium electrochemical workstation under dark conditions and illumination under AM 1.5G sunlight. Under dark conditions, the EIS Nyquist plots were measured at a bias of 1.1 V in the frequency ranging from 1 to 105 Hz. Under AM 1.5G sunlight, the EIS Nyquist plots were measured at a bias of 0.9 V in the frequency ranging from 0.1 to 105 Hz.
3. Results and discussion
Multiple-cation perovskite on home-made ZnO ETL was prepared via a DMSO-mediated one-step solution method. First, a highly crystalline FA1−xCsxPbI3 film (abbreviated as FACsx, where x is the percentage of Cs) was obtained by optimizing the Cs composition and annealing temperature. Second, based on the optimal Cs content, MAI was incorporated into FACsx to form a MAyFA1−x−yCsxPbI3 film (abbreviated as MAyFACsx, where y is in percentage of MA) and the dependence of the MA content and annealing temperature on the optical and electronic properties was investigated to further obtain highly crystalline MAyFACsx.
A series of FA-based perovskites mixed with Cs contents ranging from 0.05 to 0.25 were prepared on the ZnO ETL/ITO substrates annealed at 130 °C. It should be noted that pure FA perovskite was obtained after being annealed at 150 °C. Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the FACsx film (x = 0 to 0.25) on the ZnO/ITO substrates. The XRD peaks at 14.05, 19.87, 24.37, 28.19, 31.59, 35.06, 40.23, and 42.79° are ascribed to the (101), (012), (021), (202), (211), (122), (024), and (131) lattice planes of the trigonal black α-phase of FAPbI3, respectively. The XRD peak at 2θ = 11.66° was attributed to the hexagonal yellow δ-phase of FAPbI3. For pure FA perovskite, a mixed phase of yellow δ-phase and trigonal black FAPbI3 α-phase can be detected. In addition, the XRD peak from hexagonal PbI2 at 2θ = 12.72° was also found in the pure FA perovskite. After only 5 mol% Cs was added, the yellow δ-phase of FAPbI3 peak completely disappeared, indicating that alloying with a small amount of Cs within FAPbI3 induced the complete transformation to the black perovskite phase. Surprisingly, the PbI2 peak starts to decrease upon adding 5 mol% Cs and finally disappears when the Cs content further increased by over 10 mol%. Thus, alloying Cs enables to form pure photoactive black phase without the yellow FAPbI3 phase and PbI2, which is expected to facilitate an improvement in the efficiency and stability together with the reproducibility of FACs perovskite. As shown in Fig. 1b, the peak position for the (101) lattice plane gradually shifts to higher 2θ value upon increasing the Cs content, indicating the successful incorporation of Cs within FAPbI3.

It is well known that the annealing process is key to obtaining highly crystalline FACs perovskite. A high-efficiency FACs perovskite based on TiO2 ETL has been attained after annealing at 100–150 °C for a long period of time.16,27–29 Thus, the annealing temperatures of 120, 130 and 140 °C were adopted to induce the crystallization of FACs0.15 on the ZnO ETL and their XRD patterns were characterized (Fig. 1c). Clearly, no PbI2 peak can be detected in the three FACs0.15 perovskites annealed at 120–140 °C, indicating the good thermostability of the FACs0.15 perovskite on the ZnO ETL. Also, there exists a hexagonal yellow δ-phase in the FACs0.15 perovskite on the ZnO ETL annealed at 120 °C. Further, on increasing the annealing temperature to 130 °C and even higher, a complete black phase FACs0.15 perovskite is formed on the ZnO ETL. Based on these results, we selected the FACs0.15 perovskite annealed at 130 °C for the subsequent spectral and photovoltaic performance characterizations.
The absorbance spectra of the FACsx perovskite films (Fig. 2a) show that the absorption onset shifts to a lower wavelength as the Cs content increases from 0 to 0.25, indicating the increased band gaps formed upon alloying with Cs. Accordingly, a similar blue-shift upon increasing the Cs content is also found in the normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra as shown in Fig. 2b. The measured PL emission band shifts from 806 nm to 788 nm upon varying x from 0.05 to 0.25. The blue-shifts in the absorption edge and PL peaks further demonstrate that the Cs has been successfully incorporated into FAPbI3. It should be noted that such a minor band blue-shift upon varying the Cs contents is not a key factor influencing the device performance. The measured current density–voltage (J–V) curves obtained for the FACs PSCs with different Cs contents exhibit the highest PCE of 16.7% attained by the FACs0.15-based ZnO PSC, which is superior to the other alloying FACsx-based ZnO PSCs (x = 0.05, PCE = 14.17%; x = 0.1, PCE = 15.96%; x = 0.2, PCE = 14.84%; x = 0.25, PCE = 13.61%, Fig. S1 and Table S1†). Such a PCE value of the FACs0.15-based ZnO PSC falls exactly within the reported PCE values of FACs-based TiO2 PSCs.8,11,27,28,30 It should be noted that a high Voc (1.12 V) was achieved by the FACs0.15-based ZnO PSC (see Table S1†), which was superior to those of the reported FACs-based TiO2 PSCs8,11,27 and originates from the better match of the energy levels between the ZnO ETL and perovskite.31

Based on the optimized spectral and photoelectric properties of the FACs0.15 perovskite, we further incorporated MA into the FACs0.15 perovskite. The optimized FACs0.15 perovskite alloyed with MA contents from 0 to 0.2 were deposited on the ZnO ETL. Alloying the small cation MA into the FA-based perovskite structure can stabilize the photoactive black phase; however, MA based on the ZnO substrate tends to suffer from decomposition at a high annealing temperature.32 Thus, the optimal annealing process used for the MAFACs perovskite based on ZnO ETL should be determined. From the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 3a, we can see that a pure black phase MAFACs perovskite was formed after annealing at 110 °C or 120 °C and a small portion of PbI2 can be discerned after the perovskite was annealed at 130 °C, suggesting that the MAFACs perovskite starts to decompose at 130 °C. Thus, an annealing temperature of 110 °C was finally adopted to process the MAFACs perovskite for the following structural and photovoltaic performance characterizations.

From the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 3b, all the XRD peaks indicate that the black phase was well maintained upon the incorporation of MA into FACs0.15. It should be noted that no distinct peak shifting in the XRD patterns of the MAyFACs0.15 perovskites occurs as the y value increases from 0 to 0.2 (Fig. S2†), which is different from the reported peak shifting toward higher angles observed in the MA incorporated FA-based perovskite.33 Possible reasons for this are that the ionic radius of MA+ (2.70 Å) is smaller than that of the FA+ (2.79 Å) and larger than that of Cs+ (1.81 Å); hence, the incorporation of MA+ within the FACs does not induce any significant change in the octahedral volume of the FA-Cs-site cation surrounded by the PbX3 octahedron in the unit cell. Accordingly, the UV-vis absorption and PL spectra of the MAyFACs0.15 perovskite films with different MA contents are similar (Fig. 3c and d) because the amount of MA introduced into the crystal lattice was small. Additionally, the band gap of MA perovskite (1.57 eV) is located between those of FA (1.48 eV) and Cs (1.73 eV) perovskites, therefore adding a small amount of MA cannot cause a significant variation in the UV-vis absorption and PL spectra. From Fig. 3d, it can be seen that the PL peak intensity first decreases and then increases as the MA content increased from 0.05 to 0.2. The variation in the PL intensity can be used to reveal the electronic injection and electron–hole recombination properties at the interface between ZnO and perovskite. A reduction in the PL peak intensity indicates suppressed charge recombination in the perovskite film and more efficient electron injection into the ZnO ETL from the perovskite layer. The lowest PL intensity was observed for MA0.1FACs0.15, resulting from high crystallinity and stable structure of the perovskite formed by the incorporation of the MA cation with content of 0.1. A suppressed charge recombination facilitates the improvement in the device performance, which can be verified by the cell photovoltaic performance (Fig. S3 and Table S2†). The PCE of MA mixed perovskite films first increases to a maximum of 20.09% in MA0.1FACs0.15 PSC with Voc of 1.13 V, Jsc of 23.15 mA cm−2, and FF of 76.81% and then decreases to 18.24% with Voc of 1.12 V, Jsc of 22.81 mA cm−2, and FF of 71.40% as the concentration of MA increases to 0.2 in MA0.2FACs0.15.
Based on the optimal FA (FA annealed at 150 °C), FACs (FACs0.15 annealed at 130 °C) and MAFACs (MA0.1FACs0.15 annealed at 110 °C) perovskites, we comprehensively investigated their morphology and optoelectronic properties together with the carrier dynamics and electron–hole recombination at the ETL/perovskite/HTL interfaces. Fig. 4a shows a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the completed device, in which the transparent ITO electrode was used as the bottom cathode, ZnO as the ETL, Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL, and a silver coating as the top anode. Fig. 4b shows the J–V curves of the best-performing FA, FACs and MAFACs with the relevant data being summarized in Table 1. The best FA cell was 13.99 (11.66)% with Voc of 1.11 (1.07) V, Jsc of 19.59 (19.69) mA cm−2, and FF of 64.32 (55.33)% measured under a reverse (forward) scan. The best PCE of FACs was 16.70 (14.76)% with a Voc of 1.12 (1.10) V, Jsc of 21.40 (21.38) mA cm−2, and FF of 69.69 (62.74)% measured under a reverse (forward) scan. Upon alloying with MA, the MAFACs achieved the best PCE of 20.09 (18.72)% with a Voc of 1.13 (1.10) V, Jsc of 23.15 (23.17) mA cm−2, and FF of 76.81 (73.44)%. The photovoltaic properties of the cells show that the improvements in the Jsc and FF values both contribute to the enhanced PSC performance achieved by the incorporation of Cs and MA-Cs. Fig. 4c shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding PSCs. The integrated Jsc values obtained from the EQE spectra are 19.47 mA cm−2 for the FA, 21.32 mA cm−2 for the FACs and 23.18 mA cm−2 for the MAFACs, which are in good agreement with their counterparts measured from the J–V curves. In the wavelength range from 400 to 800 nm, the EQE of the MAFACs PSC was clearly larger than those of the FACs and FA PSCs. The reasons for the enhanced photoelectric performance are likely to be related to the improved film quality and highly crystalline perovskite resulting from the incorporation of Cs and MA.

The surface morphologies of the FA, FACs and MAFACs films were captured using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 5a–c, the FA film synthesized using the one-step process shows a large grain size of over 200 nm. The grain size decreases to 100–200 nm upon the incorporation of Cs and further decreases to 50–100 nm for the MAFACs film. Such a decrease in the grain size owing to multiple cation seeding into the perovskite precursor for crystallization can also be observed in the FA-based perovskite upon the incorporation of Cs.26 From the AFM images shown in Fig. 5d–f, the corresponding RMS roughness of the three perovskite films was determined to be 23.3 nm for FA, 16.5 nm for FACs, and 14.8 nm for MAFACs. The smoother surface of the MAFACs film may offer a better foundation for the deposition of spiro-OMeTAD and consequently form a tight interlayer contact with the upper spiro-OMeTAD. EDS mapping (Fig. S4†) of the MAFACs shows that the elements Cs, Pb, I, C, and N are homogeneously distributed within the final perovskite, suggesting that the Cs and MA are uniformly alloyed into FAPbI3.

To ensure the accuracy of our measurements, the photovoltaic performance stability of different batches of 90 FA, FACs0.15 and MA0.1FACs0.15 devices were measured and the corresponding statistical device performance parameters including PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF are shown in Fig. 6 and Tables S3–S5.† The statistical results from 90 individual FA, FACs and MAFACs devices prove the reliable fabrication of the MAFACs based planar ZnO PSC device with better photovoltaic performance. It was found that the average Jsc value increases from 18.82 mA cm−2 (FA) to 21.2 mA cm−2 (FACs) and 22.93 mA cm−2 (MAFACs), and the average FF increases from 62.84% (FA) to 67.15% (FACs) and 75.33% (MAFACs). For the MAFACs devices, significant improvements in the Jsc and FF are observed. As a consequence, the average PCE enhances from 13.11% for FA to 15.81% for FACs and 19.48% for MAFACs. The enhanced photovoltaic performance was attributed to the decreased surface roughness and improved perovskite crystallinity. It is worth noting that the DMSO-mediated one-step solution processing perovskite devices show better reproducibility than those fabricated using a dual-solvent, i.e., DMF:DMSO (4:1)10 (see Table S6†). Fig. 7a shows the stabilized PCEs of the FA, FACs and MAFACs ZnO PSCs. It is clear that by 15% Cs substitution of FA, the stabilized PCE improves from 9.84% (FA) to 16.59% (FACs). Upon further alloying with 10% MA, the stabilized PCE increased to 19.97% (MAFACs). It is also worth noting that the PCE curve of FA has a decreasing trend with respect to time owing to the instability of FA against moisture, while the PCE curves of the FACs and MAFACs are rather flat because Cs or MA-Cs substitution improved the perovskite stability. The long-term stability of the FA, FACs and MAFACs devices without encapsulation stored under an ambient environment with a relative humidity of 40–60% at ambient temperature was investigated. The time evolutions of the photovoltaic parameters including Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE observed for the three different PSCs were recorded and shown in Fig. 7b and Fig. S5.† The FAPbI3 ZnO cell degrades within 300 h with a PCE of 70% of its highest value. Upon incorporation of 15% Cs, the moisture-resistance stability improves and the cell maintains a PCE of 80% of its highest value after being stored for 500 h. To our satisfaction, the MAFACs PSC showed excellent long-term stability within 1000 h.

For a high-efficiency PSCs, low non-radiative recombination, long carrier lifetime, and effective charge transport are necessary. The carrier dynamics and electron–hole recombination behavior in the FA, FACs and MAFACs PSCs were investigated by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) measurements. The TRPL results (Fig. 8a) can be analyzed by a tri-exponential fitting to illustrate the different recombination processes, in which τ1, τ2 and τ3 reflect the decay components owing to bimolecular recombination, free carrier recombination, and the trap states mediated recombination, respectively, and A1, A2 and A3 are the percentage of τ1, τ2 and τ3, respectively.34 The fitting values are provided in Table S7.† From the fitting results, we can see that the trap states mediated PL recombination was the dominant factor in both the FA-based (A3 = 73.27%) and FACs-based perovskites (A3 = 49.19%), and free carrier recombination is the dominant factor in the MAFACs-based perovskite (A2 = 63.80%). Such a result concerning the decrease in trap states after incorporating Cs and MA was also demonstrated by the SS-PL as shown in Fig. S6.† The average PL lifetime constants () were calculated by  = A1τ1 + A2τ2 + A3τ3. Upon incorporating 15 mol% Cs within FAPbI3, the  of the perovskite layer is shortened from 92.15 ns (FA) to 70.45 ns (FACs). The  further shortened to 56.62 ns upon adding MA into the FACs-based perovskite. The shorter  indicates faster charge carrier transfer from the perovskite layer into the ZnO electron conductor. This may be due to the enhanced crystal quality and film morphology with smoother surface after Cs and MA alloying in the FAPbI3 perovskite film, which was in agreement with our XRD, SEM and AFM analyses. The TRPL results further confirmed that the charge injection/separation efficiency was promoted at the perovskite/ZnO ETL interface upon alloying with small cations,35 leading to the enhancement in the Jsc, FF and PCE for the devices based on the multiple-cation perovskite, which was in agreement with the J–V and EQE measurements.
 Fig. 8  (a) TR-PL spectra and EIS plots of the three devices as measured at a bias of 1.1 V under dark conditions (b) and under AM 1.5 G illumination (c). 
EIS is another effective tool used to provide insight into the interfacial charge transfer and recombination process within a PSC device.36Fig. 8b shows the Nyquist plots of the three devices involving the FA, FACs and MAFACs perovskites measured at a bias of 1.1 V in the dark. One typical semicircle can be distinguished from the Nyquist plots, which is related to the overall interfacial recombination resistance (Rrec) observed in the three devices.37,38 It should be noted that the semicircle at high frequency, representing the charge transfer at the HTL layer was too small to be distinguished in the Nyquist plots measured under dark conditions. The EIS data were fitted using the equivalent circuit (see Fig. S7†) and the fitting Rrec values are shown in Table S8.† The Rrec was 282.7 Ω for the FA, 499.8 Ω for the FACs, and 1116 Ω for the MAFACs devices. Additionally, the variations in Rrec as a function of the applied voltage are shown in Fig. S8.† An increasing trend in the Rrec in the sequence of FA < FACs < MAFACs in all the applied voltage ranges can be observed. The enhanced Rrec suggests that the charge recombination in the PSCs has been successfully suppressed by doping with Cs and MA, which was beneficial for achieving a higher photovoltage.37,39
To meticulously study the charge transfer behavior at the interfaces, the EIS measurements were also conducted under illumination. The Nyquist plots measured under AM 1.5G exhibit two semicircles (Fig. 8c) and the fitting values are reported in Table S9† (equivalent circuit shown in Fig. S9†). The semicircle in the high frequency reflects the charge transfer impedance at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface and the semicircle in the low frequency range represents the recombination resistance between the perovskite and ZnO films.40,41 Clearly, the MAFACs (214.9 Ω) and FACs (305 Ω) PSCs both exhibit decreased charge transfer impedances when compared with the pure FA cell (331.8 Ω). In addition, the recombination resistance values are 1551 Ω for the FA, 1877 Ω for the FACs, and 5361 Ω for the MAFACs devices, respectively. Hence, the Nyquist plots measured under AM 1.5G indicate the improved charge transfer at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface and suppressed electron–hole recombination between the perovskite and ZnO films for the MAFACs and FACs perovskite films. Thus, the TR-PL and EIS results both verify that the MAFACs PSC device achieves an improvement in the Jsc and FF values due to the smooth perovskite surface, decreased charge recombination and improved electron transfer at the ZnO/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces.
Further, we introduced Br into the MA0.1FACs0.15 perovskite, which has been proved to be effective in stabilizing the perovskite structure and thus boosting PCE of PSCs.10,11 Specifically, a small portion of Br with the amount of 10/3 mol% was mixed with the MA0.1FACs0.15 precursor and subsequently deposited on the ZnO ETL via a spin-coating method. The photovoltaic performance of the MA0.1FA0.75Cs0.15PbI2.9Br0.1 ZnO cell is given in Fig. 9a, which shows an improved PCE of 20.44 (19.32)% with Voc of 1.13 (1.09) V, Jsc of 23.49 (23.56) mA cm−2, and FF of 77.00 (75.24)% measured under a reverse (forward) scan. Fig. 9b shows the stabilized PCE of the MA0.1FA0.75Cs0.15PbI2.9Br0.1 device. It is clear that the stabilized PCE and Jsc are maintained at 20.20% and 23.22 mA cm−2 with respect to time, respectively. This is the highest PCE of ZnO PSCs and is very close to the maximum PCE of 22.1% ever reported for PSCs based on TiO2. In addition, the PCE based on multiple-cation ZnO-based PSCs may be further enhanced via optimizing the halide composition and perovskite crystallization process, which will be investigated in our future studies. The present method can be extended to a more multi-elemental (FA, MA, Cs, Rb)Pb(I, Br, Cl)3 material systems that would deliver a PCE higher than 20%.

4. Conclusions
To summarize, a highly crystalline photoactive black phase MA and Cs co-alloying FA triple cation perovskite film on ZnO ETL was prepared by delicately controlling the MA and Cs compositions and annealing temperature. The optimal MA0.1FA0.75Cs0.15PbI3 perovskite film annealed at 110 °C achieves a high PCE of 20.09%, which is the highest observed for ZnO based PSCs. The outstanding photovoltaic performance based on the highly crystalline MA0.1FA0.75Cs0.15PbI3 ZnO cell results from the enhanced Jsc and FF values, and has been demonstrated to be attributed to the reduced surface roughness, suppressed charge recombination and improved electron transfer at the ZnO/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces. The optimal MA0.1FA0.75Cs0.15PbI3 ZnO PSC also shows excellent reproducibility and excellent long-term cell durability under ambient conditions within 1000 h. A further enhanced PCE of up to 20.44%, which is very close to the highest PCE of 22.1% ever reported for PSCs based on TiO2,10,15 was achieved by incorporating a small amount of halide (Br) in the optimal triple cation ZnO PSCs. This study provides a facile and feasible way to attain outstanding ZnO-based PSC cell efficiency and long-term stability together with high reproducibility by delicate control of the perovskite composition and crystallization.
