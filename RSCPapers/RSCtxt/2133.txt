    , Accepted 9th November 2015First published on 9th November 2015AbstractOrganolead halide perovskites have attracted extensive attention as light harvesting materials for optoelectronic devices due to their high charge carrier mobility, high photoconversion efficiency, and long charge diffusion length. In this study, we present the first self-powered organolead halide perovskite single crystal photodetector driven by a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). A high-performance planar photodetector showing a responsivity of 7.92 A W−1 to white light under a bias of 4 V was fabricated on the (100) facet of a bulk CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite single crystal. Furthermore, we demonstrate a cost-effective approach to the fabrication of a drum-shaped TENG by using two used digital versatile discs (DVDs), which could generate a high output of up to 200 V and 55 μA. By integrating the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal photodetector with the TENG, the self-powered device exhibited a large responsivity of 196 V (mW cm−2)−1 and a wide detection range from 10 μW cm−2 to 100 mW cm−2. These results provide a new strategy for driving the organolead halide perovskite photodetector with the energy harvested from the environment rather than an external power supply.
1. Introduction
Photodetectors that can convert light into an electrical signal are crucial for various applications such as laser related sensor networks, imaging techniques, optical communications and many more.1–5 Semiconductor materials are essential in this case for the generation of electron–hole (e–h) pairs via absorption of incident photons. Various types of semiconductor materials such as Si, ZnO, two-dimensional (2D) materials (MoS2, GaTe, etc.), quantum dots and conjugated polymers have been applied in photodetectors.6–11 Recently, organolead halide perovskites with a typical formula of CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br, or Cl) have emerged as perfect candidates in the optoelectronic field. Great progress has been achieved on organolead halide perovskite solar cells in the past several years. The improvements in the device structure and fabrication technique have enabled an overall power conversion efficiency over 20%.12 Thanks to the excellent intrinsic optoelectronic properties, the emerging perovskite materials also demonstrated outstanding performance as photodetectors. For instance, Hu et al.13 reported the first organolead halide perovskite based photodetector with responsivity of 3.49 A W−1 and 0.0367 A W−1 at 365 nm and 780 nm, respectively. Lee and co-workers14 demonstrated a hybrid photodetector with an enhanced responsivity as high as 180 A W−1 by introducing graphene to improve the efficient charge transfer. Very recently, Fang et al.15 demonstrated a highly sensitive perovskite photodetector which could directly measure the weak light of sub-picowatt per square centimeter through the interfacial electron transfer layer (ETL) and hole transfer layer (HTL) engineering. In addition to these CH3NH3PbX3 polycrystalline film photodetectors, the photodetectors based on organolead halide perovskite bulk single crystals have also been reported very recently.16,17
Generally, all the reported perovskite photodetectors can be mainly divided into two classes. One type of photodetector works by exploiting the photovoltaic effect.15,18–21 These photodetectors can not only detect the signals but also be powered by the detected signals. The photogenerated e–h pairs are usually separated by the built-in potential difference provided by the junction-based multi-layer structures, which often involve a complicated, time-consuming and uneconomic device fabrication process.19 More importantly, material choice of these kinds of devices is limited due to issues such as lattice mismatch, surface states and band alignment. The other type is the conventional photoconductive photodetectors in planar geometry (semiconducting film deposited over the laterally arranged electrodes).13,14,22–28 The simple structure endows them the convenience to fabricate or integrate with other devices. However, these photoconductive photodetectors need to be driven by an external power supply. This issue not only increases the system size but also greatly limits the mobility and independence.29 In this regard, it is of paramount importance to build a self-powered photodetector system that operates independently, sustainably, and wirelessly.
Owing to their sufficient electrical output, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been widely used in self-powered systems such as chemical sensors,30 UV sensors,31 biosensors,32 and magnetic sensors.33 As an energy transferrer, a TENG can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy by conjunction of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction.34–36 However, wider adoption of TENGs in the sensor field may be shadowed by the imperfect repeatability. In general, the randomness of external mechanical force usually results in nonuniform output peak values of the TENG, which restrict the fine quantitative study of each kind of sensor. Furthermore, to enhance the performance of TENGs, the surface morphologies of the friction layers were usually modified by complex micro- and nano-processing technologies such as photolithography,37 dry-etching,38 and block copolymer self-assembly.39 Most of these methods rely on expensive equipments and are difficult for mass production, hindering the popularity of TENGs in self-powered systems.
In this work, we demonstrate a self-powered photoconductive photodetector based on a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite single crystal. Single crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 affords the planar-type photodetector a high sensitivity of 7.92 A W−1 to white light at a bias of 4 V. To break the stranglehold of the external power supply for such a photoconductive photodetector, we have configured a well-designed TENG to drive it. Through a periodic impact on the TENG by finger tapping, a high responsivity of 196 V (mW cm−2)−1 coupled with a wide detection range from 10 μW cm−2 to 100 mW cm−2 can be obtained. The TENG has a new and simple drum-shaped structure and consists of two used digital versatile discs (DVDs). Thus, it can be achieved through a very simple process which overcomes the limitations such as expensive instruments, high operating cost, as well as complex procedures in the fabrication of TENGs. This smart integrated module shows great potential as a self-powered photoconductive photodetector because it is directly driven by the energy harvested from its working environment rather than bulky batteries or power cables.
2. Experimental
2.1 Crystal growth and fabrication of photodetector
The CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals were grown by a simple solution-processed method.40 Briefly, Pb(Ac)2(H2O)3 (99.5%, Sinoreagent) was dissolved in HI (57 wt% aqueous solution, Acros Organics) to get a clear yellow PbI2 solution. CH3NH3I was prepared by neutralizing equimolar amounts of CH3NH2 (40 wt% aqueous solution, Aladdin) and HI. Then, the homogenous mixture of PbI2 and CH3NH3I solution was transferred to an oven. Black crystals were obtained by slowly cooling down the mixture to room temperature. To fabricate the planar photodetector, the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite single crystal was thinned and polished along the (100) direction to ∼1 mm thickness using a mechanical method. The polished CH3NH3PbI3 crystal was pasted on a glass slide serving as a holder. Then, a pair of Au electrodes with a channel of 60 μm in length and 1 mm in width were deposited on the top surface by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask.
2.2 Fabrication of DVD-based TENG
Polycarbonate (PC) substrates were detached from the used commercially available DVDs, due to their low cost and ready availability. After soaking in 2 mol L−1 NaOH (Sinopharm) and 2 mol L−1 HNO3 (Sinopharm) for several hours, the metal coating layer in the DVD was fully dissolved. Then, the protective layer can be easily peeled off from the DVD. The PC substrate was rinsed with ethanol (99.95%, Sinopharm) to remove the residual organic dye. No chemical modification was needed for this nano-patterned face used as the friction layer of the TENG. An Al conductive tape was stuck to the reverse side as an electrode. A sanded Cu conductive tape was stuck to another DVD as the opposite friction layer. Finally, four pieces of PET were used to connect the two friction layers face-to-face, resulting in a drum-shaped TENG.
2.3 Characterization of materials and devices
The crystal structure of the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8-Advance) using Cu Kα radiation. PL spectra were collected by confocal Raman microscopic systems (Renishaw) with a 514 nm laser. The surface morphology of the roughened Cu electrode was observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM-6335F). The nanostructure of the PC substrates detached from a used DVD was imaged using an atomic force microscope (AFM, Veeco Nanoscope V) in tapping mode. The current–voltage (I–V) and photodetection properties of the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal photodetector were measured using an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER CIMPS) and a digital sourcemeter (Keithley 2400) under dark and illuminated conditions. A solar simulator (xenon lamp, Oriel, AM 1.5G light) and optical attenuators were used for adjustable illumination. The output voltage and current of the DVD-based triboelectric nanogenerator were measured using a digital multimeter (RIGOL DM3068). The self-powered photodetector measurement was performed by connecting the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal and the TENG in a designed circuit. With the continuous finger tapping on the TENG, the dividing voltage on CH3NH3PbI3 was measured using a digital multimeter (RIGOL DM3068) as a function of light intensity.
3. Results and discussion
The single crystal of CH3NH3PbI3 was grown by a method similar to the reported solution crystallization process.40Fig. 1a shows the powder XRD pattern of the ground crystals. All the diffraction peaks can be assigned to a perovskite structure with high purity and good quality.41 The inset in Fig. 1a illustrates the resulting CH3NH3PbI3 bulk crystal with the oriented natural (100) facet labelled. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of this CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal is demonstrated in Fig. 1b. The photoluminescence peak position is located at 775 nm, in good agreement with the value of this semiconductor reported earlier.42

The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite single crystal was further processed to fabricate the photodetector with the simplest planar structure as schematically shown in Fig. 2a. To characterize the photodetector, we used a solar simulator coupled with optical attenuators as the white light source. Fig. 2b and c show the typical current–voltage (I–V) curves of the perovskite photodetector in the dark and illuminated with various intensities from 100 mW cm−2 to 10 μW cm−2. In order to make a clear contrast between the dark current and the photocurrent under weak light, the I–V curves in Fig. 2c are plotted in a semi-log scale. It is apparent that the photocurrent (Iph) increases with the increase of light intensity (P), being consistent with the fact that more e–h pairs are excited by the increase of photon flux density. The corresponding dependence can be well fitted by a power law, Iph ∼ Pβ, where β is a factor that determines the response of the photocurrent to intensity. As plotted in Fig. 2d, the fitting gives a linear behavior with β = 0.66. This non-unity exponent (0.5 < β < 1) was due to the complex process of e–h pair generation, recombination and trapping in CH3NH3PbI3.43,44 The responsivity R is a key parameter for photodetectors, and can be expressed as the following equation:  where S is the effective area. It can be seen from Fig. 2d that the obtained responsivity also shows a linear relationship with light intensity. Importantly, a high photoresponsivity of 7.92 A W−1 is observed in our device which is much higher than the values reported in polycrystalline film devices under the same light intensity (3.49 A W−1).13 The enhancement is derived from the presence of much less defects in single crystalline CH3NH3PbI3. The elimination of grain boundaries and defects in the carrier transport direction can reduce the charge recombination and improve the carrier diffusion length. For a given semiconductor applied in a photodetector, the carrier diffusion length determines how efficiently the photogenerated free charges can be collected by the electrode. Recently, a surprisingly long carrier diffusion length of >175 μm has been reported in the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals, which is several orders of magnitude higher than the value in the polycrystalline film.45

(d) Photocurrent and photoresponsivity as a function of illumination intensity at a bias of 4 V. 
Next, we characterized the photoresponse switching behavior in order to clarify the robustness and reproducibility of this perovskite photodetector. As shown in Fig. 3a, the channel current as a function of time was measured by periodically switching 100 mW cm−2 light illumination. More than a dozen switching cycles were performed at a bias of 4 V. The photodetector exhibited good on–off switching with a current ratio around 130. The response time is another important parameter of a photodetector. It can be seen from the enlarged view of a single on–off cycle (Fig. 3b), both the rise and decay time (tr and td) are smaller than 0.2 s, acquiring the exact values of which is limited by the detection limit of our measurement system.

The above results indicate that the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal photodetector can achieve a satisfactory performance with the simplest planar geometry. However, all the electrical signals of this photodetector were driven by the external bias. While self-powered nanosystems have gradually become the most desirable and promising prototype for environmental detection nowadays because no battery is needed to power the device. Bearing this in mind, we paid our attention to the triboelectric nanogenerators, which have emerged as a rising star in the field of self-powered nanosystems. As for this power generation unit, a potential is first created between two materials that have opposite tribo-polarity due to the charge transfer caused by the triboelectric effect. Then, in the outer circuit, electrons are driven to flow between two electrodes attached to the generator in order to balance the potential.34 Previous studies have demonstrated that micro/nanostructures existing on the surface of friction layers could contribute to higher performance of a TENG.35 However, the fabrication of most of these micro/nanostructures relies on the expensive equipment, complex procedures, etc. It is well known that the DVD used in our daily life possesses a ready-made nanopatterned surface. Although it has been successfully used as a low-cost and environmentally friendly nanoimprint mold,46 their application in the field of TENG has rarely been reported. To take advantage of the fine nanostructures on the DVD surface, we designed a novel TENG made from two used DVDs. Fig. 4a schematically illuminates the drum-shaped structure of this TENG. The polycarbonate (PC) substrate with a nanopatterned surface detached from a used DVD and a rough Cu conductive tape sticking on the other used DVD were chosen as the opposite friction layers. The pressing and releasing cycles of this drum-shaped TENG can be easily realized based on the elasticity of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) connector distributed in four directions. The detailed working principle is depicted in Fig. S1 in the ESI.†Fig. 4b displays a photograph of the transparent PC substrate detached from a used DVD. Fig. 4c shows the corresponding AFM image scanned from an arbitrary area in the PC substrate. In the scanned area of 15 μm × 15 μm, several DVD pits with a depth of about 200 nm can be observed. More detailed information on the pit sizes and their distances is given in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† Furthermore, in order to enhance the performance of a TENG, the Cu conductive tape was sanded before sticking to another used DVD serving as the opposite friction layer. Fig. 4d shows the SEM image of the sanded Cu tape, revealing the micro/nano-structured surface.

We then investigated the output performance of this novel TENG under periodic deformation through finger tapping. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the peak values of the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current were found to be about 200 V and 55 μA, respectively. To verify that the measured signals were purely generated by the TENG, the widely used switching polarity test was also conducted for this DVD-based TENG (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). Moreover, to visually present the generated electrical energy, 50 commercial green LEDs were directly turned on by finger tapping the TENG (see Video S1 in the ESI†).

The high performance of this DVD-based nanogenerator enables us to harvest energy from the working environment and directly drive the previously mentioned CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal photodetector. However, because of the randomness of finger tapping, the peak value of the obtained output voltage cannot be kept as a constant (see Fig. 5a). This is a widespread problem which restricts the development of TENGs in self-powered devices, especially the quantitative sensors. While repeated compressive loading cycles produced by a linear motor to substitute the finger tapping to deform a nanogenerator was proven to be feasible previously,30 but this method is not convenient in practical applications. Here, we present a new approach to solve this problem by a unique circuit design. Fig. 6a shows the equivalent circuit of our self-powered photodetector nanosystem. A commercial Zener diode (1N4764A) was connected in parallel to the TENG as a voltage regulator. As is known, the diode exhibits a controlled breakdown voltage and keeps the voltage drop close to the Zener breakdown voltage across a wide range of reverse currents. The regulated voltage after applying the Zener diode (see Fig. S4 in the ESI†) was used to drive the perovskite photodetector. Here, the photodetector behaves as a variable external load resistor which can be controlled by incident light. As expected, it was observed that the measured voltage drop across the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal photodetector changed as a function of the illumination intensity. In can be seen in Fig. 6b and c that the measured voltage decreases with increasing illumination intensity. The change in the voltage can be defined by [(V0 − V)/V0] × 100%, where V0 corresponds to the dark voltage and V corresponds to the measured voltage under different light illumination intensities. The dependence of the voltage change on the incident intensity shows an exponential relationship from 100 mW cm−2 to 10 μW cm−2 (Fig. 6d). The measuring principle set forth herein is different from that in conventional photoconductors, i.e., the detection signal is a voltage rather than a current. One reason lies in the fact that the recently developed TENG that harvests mechanical energy features extremely high voltage but limited current (up to 200 V but 55 μA in this work). In this case, the voltage is a large signal which is easier to detect. On the other hand, according to the equivalent circuit design shown in Fig. 6a, a commercial Zener diode was connected in parallel to the TENG as a voltage regulator. Using the regulated voltage to drive the photodetector can easily and effectively improve the accuracy of self-powered sensors. Since the current signal will decrease as the incident light becomes weak, it is difficult for us to control the peak value of the current signal at a constant value under the same incident intensity. As a result, the accuracy of this current mode will be worse than that of the voltage mode. Considering these two points, we choose voltage rather than current as the detection signal for an easier and more accurate measurement. Therefore, photoresponsivity (Rv) of this nanosystem is defined as follows:RV = (V0 − V)/Pwhere P corresponds to the incident light intensity. Fig. 6d shows the photoresponsivity as a function of light intensity, which can be fitted very well with Rv ∼ P0.59. The nanosystem exhibits a wide detection range from 10 μW cm−2 to 100 mW cm−2 and the largest responsivity of 196 V (mW cm−2)−1 at an illumination intensity of 10 μW cm−2. Since the TENG can be easily driven wherever movement is available, the creative combination of a TENG and the perovskite photodetector can work as a sustainable and wireless self-powered system.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a self-powered planar photodetector based on CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals. On the one hand, the excellent intrinsic optoelectronic properties of single crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 ensured the planar photodetector with a high responsivity of 7.92 A W−1 to white light under a bias of 4 V. On the other hand, an efficient TENG was made from two used DVDs generating an effective output of up to 200 V and 55 μA. By configuring such a TENG to the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal photodetector, a self-powered module was attained and it exhibited a high responsivity of 196 V (mW cm−2)−1 and a wide detection range from 10 μW cm−2 to 100 mW cm−2. It is also worth mentioning that the Zener diode has been introduced as a voltage regulator of the TENG, which provides a universal method for easily and effectively improving the accuracy of a self-powered device, especially for the quantitative sensors. Our results might open up an avenue for the application of organolead halide perovskite materials in self-powered optoelectronic devices.
