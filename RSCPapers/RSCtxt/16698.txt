    , Accepted 16th September 2016First published on 16th September 2016AbstractThe first combined theoretical and photovoltaic characterization of both homoleptic and heteroleptic Fe(II)–carbene sensitized photoanodes in working dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has been performed. Three new heteroleptic Fe(II)–NHC dye sensitizers have been synthesized, characterized and tested. Despite an improved interfacial charge separation in comparison to the homoleptic compounds, the heteroleptic complexes did not show boosted photovoltaic performances. The ab initio quantitative analysis of the interfacial electron and hole transfers and the measured photovoltaic data clearly evidenced fast recombination reactions for heteroleptics, even associated with un unfavorable directional electron flow, and hence slower injection rates, in the case of homoleptics. Notably, quantum mechanics calculations revealed that deprotonation of the not anchored carboxylic function in the homoleptic complex can effectively accelerate the electron injection rate and completely suppress the electron recombination to the oxidized dye. This result suggests that introduction of strong electron-donating substituents on the not-anchored carbene ligand in heteroleptic complexes, in such a way of mimicking the electronic effects of the carboxylate functionality, should yield markedly improved interfacial charge generation properties. The present results, providing for the first time a detailed understanding of the interfacial electron transfers and photovoltaic characterization in Fe(II)–carbene sensitized solar cells, open the way to a rational molecular engineering of efficient iron-based dyes for photoelectrochemical applications.
1. Introduction
Due to the continuous consumption of fossil fuels and the associated inexorable increase in environmental pollution, exploiting the solar energy to produce electricity,1 or storing it into H2 or alternative solar fuels,2–4 represents one of the most compelling technological challenges. In this context, nanostructured dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)5–9 offer a valuable solution, at a comparable cost and, in principle, lower environmental impact, to traditional silicon-based photovoltaics. To date ruthenium polypyridyl complexes have been the most extensively studied dye sensitizers with up to 11% conversion efficiency.10–14 The remarkable success obtained by Ru(II) dyes when employed as photosensitizers or photocatalysts15,16 can be traced back to their high electron injection quantum yields,15,17–21 coming from the high values of the electron injection rates compared to the intrinsic long lifetimes (from tens to hundreds of nanoseconds) of metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) lowest excited states of isolated complexes. These MLCT states are indeed responsible for the electron injection into the semiconductor conduction band (CB). Electron injection is also favored by an efficient interfacial electron–hole separation and by their peculiar adsorption geometry.21 The same properties minimize detrimental charge recombination back onto the sensitizer. However, despite its record efficiencies, in the view of large-scale solar energy production, ruthenium suffers from serious drawbacks, which potentially limit its widespread applicability, mainly related to its toxicity and scarcity. This has motivated continuous research efforts to develop valuable alternatives: cheap and easily tunable fully organic sensitizers on one side,22,23 and earth-abundant, less expensive and environmentally friendly d-block metal (for example iron and copper) complexes on the other side.24–33 Despite an intense MLCT absorption, however, conventional Fe(II)–polypyridyl complexes are, unfortunately, characterized by an ultrafast (ca. 100 fs) deactivation to low-lying metal centered (MC) states, proceeding via the triplet 3MC and ultimately populating the quintuplet 5T2 state,34–39 which impedes electron injection into the sensitized semiconductor.40,41 One of the most successful strategies employed to delay the deactivation of 1,3MLCT to MC states consists of increasing the ligand field strength.42–55 In particular, significant advances have been recently reported by using N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC),47,52–54,56 where, as a consequence of the presence of the σ-donating carbene ligands, the metal-centered 3MC and 5T2 states are strongly destabilized, resulting in record 3MLCT lifetimes of 16 and 26 ps,54 for the C252 and C44 complexes (functionalized by carboxylic groups to be covalently grafted onto the TiO2 surface) shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of the investigated iron complexes. 
Besides the improved 1,3MLCT lifetime, constituting the prerequisite for injecting electrons into the semiconductor's CB, the measured overall cell efficiency finally depends on the peculiar molecule/metal oxide interfacial properties (adsorption configuration, electronic coupling, charge generation, charge recombination etc…), which in turn can be reliably characterized by state-of-the-art first principle calculations.57–60 In the last decade, indeed, quantum mechanical modeling of the isolated cell components40,44,48,52–54,61–63 as well as of combined dye/semiconductor systems39,43,51,57,64–68 has been shown to successfully support the experimental research by providing an atomistic understanding of the fundamental chemical and physical processes governing the cell functioning and its performances.
As a matter of fact, the first photovoltaic characterization of the Fe(II)–NHC complex C2 (Fig. 1) was reported by some of us in ref. 52, with the first realization of a potentially exploitable iron-based DSSC. C2-based devices revealed, however, low current generation and photovoltage, finally resulting in a weak power conversion efficiencies. Interestingly, a subsequent work by Wärnmark and co-workers49 claimed a record injection efficiency, almost unitary, for the same complex, suggesting that the vibrationally relaxed and long-lived 3MLCT might be responsible for this exceptionally high injection yield. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also reported by the authors49 to rationalize the experimental findings, although their computations were limited to the energy level alignment calculated for the isolated dye and TiO2 anatase slab, that is the electronic structure of the dye/TiO2 interface was not considered. The reported high injection yield and low photovoltaic performances in working DSSCs, clearly, pose intriguing questions related to the efficiency of the forward and backward interfacial electron transfer processes, whose interplay determines the final cell performance. This issue was partially tackled by a second recent computational contribution put forward by the same authors:51 here, along with the electronic and excited state properties of isolated Fe(II)–NHC complexes, the structure of the dye/TiO2 interface was also investigated, at least for a prototypical heteroleptic analogous of the original C2 complex (C5 in Fig. 1). Analysis of the projected dye and TiO2 density of states (PDOS) at the interface revealed that energetics and nature of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs and LUMOs) should allow efficient (ca. 100 fs) electron injection from both hot and thermally relaxed dye's 3MLCT excited states to the semiconductor conduction band.51 As pointed out by Galoppini,69 a number of open issues, however, still remain toward the development of efficient iron-based DSSCs. The peculiar interfacial properties of the homoleptic C2 complex showing conflicting unitary injection yield49 and extremely low photovoltaic efficiency have not yet been elucidated, as well as the impact on the solar cell performances of possible structural modifications of the NHC ligand core (C4 in Fig. 1). Moreover, calculations suggest that the heteroleptic complexes potentially have the desired interfacial energetic and electronic coupling to efficiently sensitize the TiO2 surface,51 but their synthesis and applications in working DSSCs have not been reported up to now.
Thus, with the aim of providing an unified and fundamental understanding of the interfacial charge generation and sensitization properties of Fe(II)–carbene complexes in working DSSCs, we report a quantitative analysis based on high-level DFT calculations on realistic models of the relevant interfacial electron transfers as well as, to the best of our knowledge, the first photovoltaic application of new homoleptic (C4 in Fig. 1) and heteroleptic (C5, C6 and C7Fig. 1) Fe(II)–NHC complexes.
Our findings definitely show that for the homoleptic complexes, although electron injection from the lowest energy MLCT dye's excited state is energetically favored, in the surface-grafted sensitizer the topology of the lowest-energy MLCT state does not allow electronic coupling with the surface and hence an efficient electron injection mechanism. Operational conditions favoring deprotonation of the not-coordinated carboxylic group might however invert the stability of the two lowest MLCT states and allow, to a certain extent, electron injection into the semiconductor. On the other hand, heteroleptic sensitizers, despite being characterized by the desired charge flow toward the TiO2 surface in the lowest MLCT state, still present lower injection rates when compared to the best performing Ru(II)–polypyridyl and, as a matter of fact, do not yield improved photovoltaic performances. Besides the design of Fe(II) complexes endowed with long-lived 3MLCT states strongly coupled with the semiconductor CB states, the present results, in line with the fast hole/electron recombination reactions observed by Wärnmark and co-workers,49 indicate that the main obstacle to the development of efficient Fe(II)-based dye sensitizers is represented by the high favored recombination pathways with both the oxidized dye and the redox mediator.
2. Methods and models
2.1 Synthesis of dyes

C2 and C4 have been prepared according to ref. 52 and 54 respectively. The preparation of heteroleptic complexes C5, C6 and C7 is described in the ESI.†
2.2 DSSC fabrication and photovoltaic measurements
The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates (TEC Glass-TEC 8, solar 2.3 mm thickness), TiO2 paste, electrolyte (AN50) and Pt-paste (Platisol T/SP) were purchased from Solaronix. FTO glass plates were cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min and then rinsed with water and ethanol. Next, the plates were immersed into a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min in a chamber. After being washed with deionized water and fully rinsed with ethanol, a transparent nanocrystalline layer was prepared on the FTO glass plates by using a screen-printing technique. TiO2 paste was dried for 5 min at 150 °C. The TiO2 electrodes were finally heated under an air atmosphere at 450 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 electrodes were treated again with TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. A TiO2 film comprising a 10–11 μm-thick transparent layer was obtained as checked using a profilometer. The prepared TiO2 film on the FTO electrode was immersed in the 0.5 mM acetonitrile dye solution containing chenodeoxycholic acid (0.1 mM) at room temperature overnight and finally quickly rinsed with acetonitrile before assembly. FTO plates for the counter electrodes were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath in acetone. The counter electrodes were prepared by screen-printing of Platisol onto the FTO coated glass substrate and then heated at 450 °C for 30 min under an air atmosphere. The platinum counter electrodes and the dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrodes were assembled into a sealed sandwich-type cell by heating at 80 °C using a hot-melt film (30 μm spacer Surlyn) between the electrodes. A drop of AN50 solution was placed in the drilled hole of the counter electrode. Finally, the hole was sealed using additional Surlyn and a cover glass (0.1 mm thickness). The photovoltaic characterization of the Fe–carbene-sensitized TiO2 cells was obtained using two complementary techniques. The irradiated surface was 0.36 cm2. The spectral response was determined by measuring the wavelength dependence of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) using light from an Osram 300 W xenon lamp coupled to a Newport monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone 260). Photocurrents were measured under short circuit conditions (DC mode) using a Newport 1936R optical power meter. The incident irradiance was measured using a 1 cm2 calibrated silicon photodiode. For J/V measurements we used the same lamp (Osram 300 W xenon) with an AM 1.5G filter solar spectrum in the 350–900 nm domain and a power of 100 mW cm−2. The incident irradiance was measured using a ISO-Tech ISM410. The current–voltage characteristics were determined by applying an external potential bias to the cell using a Radiometer potentiostat (PGP 201) sweeping the potential with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1.
2.3 Computations
The semiconductor surface was modeled by a neutral stoichiometric (TiO2)82 cluster of ca. 2 × 2 nm side, obtained by “cutting” an anatase slab exposing the majority (101) surface.70,71 This cluster model provides energy levels in close agreement with experimental band edges of anatase TiO2,62,72 when global hybrid functionals and implicit solvation models are employed. Ground state equilibrium geometry of the dye@TiO2 assemblies was optimized in the gas phase using the ADF program package,73 using the Becke-Perdew exchange–correlation functional74,75 and a DZP (C,H,O,N)/TZP (Fe,Ti) basis set. The interfacial electronic structure was determined by single point DFT calculations in acetonitrile solution (ε = 37.5) carried out on the optimized dye@TiO2 complexes using the hybrid B3LYP functional, a 6-31G* basis set and a polarizable continuum model of solvation (C-PCM)76,77 as implemented in the Gaussian09 package.78
In a simple Newns–Anderson picture, the broadening of the dye's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) projected density of states (PDOS) over the semiconductor CB states can be used to calculate the injection time.79–84 As recently shown,85 however, this approach, based on the Mulliken population analysis for the determination of the PDOS, is significantly sensitive to the basis set quality. A more quantitative calculation of the coupling between the dye's donor states and the CB states can be obtained in a diabatic-like scheme, proposed by Thoss and co-workers86,87 and detailed in the following.
To estimate the efficiency of the electron/hole injection from the dye to the semiconductor, we resorted to a Fermi golden rule framework, where the injection rate kinj (whose inverse is the injection time τ) is defined as: (1)where k represents the manifold of TiO2 acceptor (conduction or valence band) states of interest and d is the dye donor state (LUMO in the case of injection and HOMO in the case of recombination). The product between the square of the electronic coupling elements, |Vdk|2, and the semiconductor density of states (DOS), ρ(εk), defines the electron transfer probability distribution Γ(εk). The diabatic donor (dye) and acceptor (TiO2) states were obtained by localization of the molecular orbitals of the entire complex on the donor and acceptor species. This results in a block Fock matrix of the interacting dye@TiO2 system, where the diagonal elements represent the energies of the localized states, while the off-diagonal blocks contain the coupling elements Vdk. Finally injection times can be calculated as .
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Photovoltaic characterization of homoleptic Fe(II)–NHC complexes
The photovoltaic properties of C2 based DSSCs have been reported by some of us in ref. 52, while for the C4 complex, featuring benzimidazolylidene(BIm)-based ligands and showing a record 3MLCT lifetime efficiency of 26 ps, solely the synthesis and photophysical characterization have been published up to now.54 Since C4 presents a longer excited state lifetime, and thus a larger time window for carrier injection than C2, and comparable optical and structural properties, one might expect similar or even better photovoltaic performances in working DSSCs.

Fig. 2 displays the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the complexes in acetonitrile (A) and sensitized TiO2 films (B) as well as the IPCE (C) and J/V (D) curves for the cells fabricated with C2 and C4, while the photovoltaic and surface loading data are listed in Table 1. In acetonitrile solution, C2 presents an absorption peak, associated with the singlet MLCT states, at 520 nm (2.38 eV) with the extinction absorption coefficient of 16200 M−1 cm−1, while the lowest-energy absorption band of C4 appears slightly blue-shifted (501 nm/2.48 eV) and with an absorbance lower by about 20% (12800 M−1 cm−1, Table S1 in the ESI†). Regarding the optical UV-Vis absorption spectra of the sensitized anatase films (Fig. 2B), the C4@TiO2 absorbance appears to be almost half of that recorded for C2@TiO2, clearly suggesting a less efficient surface coverage. The estimated dye loads are indeed 0.09 and 0.06 μmol cm−2 for C2 and C4, respectively, to be compared with the value of 0.08 μmol cm−2 recorded under the same conditions for N719. Since there are in principle no reasons to hypothesize a different adsorption mode for C4 with respect to C2, the lower coverage seems to be ascribable to the presence of the bulky BIm substituents, which almost double the dye volume.

IPCE plots (Fig. 2C) recorded for devices employing the I3−/I− redox couple and CDCA, to suppress dye aggregation, show that while an appreciable, even if modest, IPCE was recorded (about 2.3% at 500 nm) for C2, for the cell fabricated with C4 basically only negligible electron injection into the semiconductor was detected (about 0.2% at 500 nm). The measured photocurrent density for the C4-sensitized solar cell is more than three times lower than that measured for C2 (0.12 vs. 0.41 mA cm−2) and a 20% reduction in Voc is also observed. Both the poor performance of the C4 complex, and the extremely low photocurrents measured for C2, despite its good optical and photophysical properties and the reported 92% injection yield,49 seem to indicate an inefficient interfacial charge separation process, possibly associated with fast recombination reactions, observed to take place in the picosecond and nanosecond time scale.49 Importantly, as shown in Table 1, the surface dye load value for C2 is even larger then that of the N719 reference dye, allowing us to leave out any problem related to an inefficient TiO2 sensitization.
3.2 Structural and electronic properties of the Fe(II)–NHC interfaces
To shed light on the efficiency of the interfacial hole and electron transfer processes, here we shall characterize, by means of DFT calculations, the structural and charge separation properties of the sensitized-TiO2 interfaces.
The ground state optimized structures of the C2 and C4 complexes adsorbed on the (TiO2)82 cluster are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† Here we consider the bidentate anchoring of the carboxylate to the undercoordinated Ti atoms of the (101) anatase surface, which is well-known to be the energetically favored one.61 A first comment concerns the geometrical arrangement of the molecules on the surface. In both cases the complexes appear to be markedly tilted on the semiconductor surface, forming an angle of approximately 45 degrees with the TiO2 plane. This is consistent with the coordination geometry recently reported for the analogous heteroleptic complex of C2 on an anatase-(TiO2)92 slab.51 The strong tilt towards the surface also yields a slight elongation of the O–Ti distance, which increases from the typical 2.05–2.10 Å value, calculated for adsorbed carboxylate groups, to an average value of 2.20–2.25 Å.
The electronic structure and energy level alignment of the dye-sensitized TiO2 interface can be analyzed by inspection of the Projected Density of States (PDOS) and frontier molecular orbitals (MOs), as depicted in Fig. 3 for C2 (top) and C4 (bottom), where the % contribution of localization on the dye of the relevant frontier MOs is also indicated. From the energetic point of view, the Fe(II)–carbene/TiO2 interfaces resemble the typical alignment of Ru(II)–polypyridyl/TiO2 interfaces, with the highest occupied MOs lying above the semiconductor valence band (VB) and the lowest unoccupied MO above the semiconductor CB edge, that here we calculate at −3.46/−3.47 eV for C2@TiO2/C4@TiO2. As is apparent, both C2 and C4 have HOMOs delocalized over the whole molecular skeleton and presenting a sizeable mixing with the TiO2 VB states (around 30–50%), manifested by the tail of the TiO2 VB PDOS extending through the dye's HOMO PDOS. Going from C2 to C4 the calculated dye's HOMO shifts from −5.70 to −5.96 eV, with a stabilization of 0.26 eV, which, within the simplest Koopman's approximation, almost quantitatively compares with that experimentally measured shift (0.28 eV) in the FeIII/FeII oxidation potentials (Table S1 in the ESI†).
 Fig. 3  Projected DOS (PDOS) and main dye's MOs isodensity plots for the C2 (top) and C4 (bottom) complexes adsorbed onto the (TiO2)82 cluster. For the depicted MOs the % contribution of population localized on the dye is also indicated. The gaussian broadening used to reproduce the PDOS is equal to 0.3 eV. Vertical sticks represent the Kohn–Sham eigenvalues and their intensity the % dye's population. 
However, a deeper analysis of the topology and alignment of the unoccupied states may deliver us more precise information on the interfacial charge separation and electron injection capability.
For both C2 and C4 we find that the dye's LUMO, calculated at −2.63/−2.71 eV, respectively, is essentially not coupled with the semiconductor CB states: it is, in fact, almost completely localized on the dye (93% and 97% for C2 and C4 respectively) and, above all, it extends over the ligand not anchored to the TiO2 surface (see isodensity plots in Fig. 3). On the other hand, the LUMO+1 distribution is markedly broadened and strongly coupled with the CB states (see the appreciable electronic density on the TiO2 slab appearing in the isodensity plots in Fig. 3). A 100% dye's LUMO+1 population is, in fact, obtained summing over 190 and 150 dye–TiO2 mixed states in the case of C2 and C4, respectively. As is apparent from the plots of the isodensity surfaces in Fig. 3, the lower energy tail is dominated by contributions mainly localized on the anchoring moiety with strong delocalization toward the CB TiO2 states, while at higher energies still large density contributions on the not anchored ligand appear, above all for C2. Thus, even if the interfacial energetics would allow electron injection, as discussed in ref. 49, the primary charge transfer character for the lowest MLCT state appears to be in the opposite direction to the one necessary to inject into the TiO2 CB. This fact is the direct result of the adsorption of the dye onto the TiO2 surface: the near-degeneracy between the two lowest unoccupied orbitals localized on the two ligands52 in the isolated complexes is removed upon COOH deprotonation and subsequent binding to the Ti atoms. As TiO2 is a weaker electron acceptor than the opposite H+, the orbital localized on the anchored ligand turns out to be destabilized with respect to the one bearing the free COOH group. A structural distortion in the anchored dye can also contribute to the relative stabilization/destabilization of the LUMO and LUMO+1. In particular, since the LUMO (LUMO+1) is considerably delocalized on the COOH unit one can expect a sizeable destabilization upon deprotonation and, indeed, considering the isolated C2 complex in acetonitrile solution, we calculated (B3LYP/6-31G*) an upshift of about 0.8 eV of the Kohn–Sham eigenvalue of the associated unoccupied MO. Coordination to the anatase surface clearly reduces this energy penalty, even if a LUMO–LUMO+1 energy difference of about 0.4 eV still remains.
With this information in mind, it is interesting to do a step backward and notice the marked broadening and weak, but still appreciable, splitting in the absorption spectra maxima of the C2- and C4-sensitized TiO2 films (Fig. 2B). It is worthwhile to stress, however, that the extent of the energy separation between these two MLCT states crucially depends on the cell preparation and working conditions. The use of ionic additives in the electrolyte, acidic treatment of the TiO2 substrate, pH conditions and coexistence of multiple anchoring modes can interplay in restoring/removing their near degeneracy. In fact, as shown by the PDOS in Fig. 4, the deprotonation of the not-coordinated COOH group in C2 is sufficient to invert the LUMO/LUMO+1 nature and to redirect the charge flow of the lowest energy MLCT state toward the surface, guaranteeing a strong coupling with the TiO2 CB states. In line with what is discussed above for the LUMO+1 population, we notice that the LUMO distribution also contains significant contributions on the not-anchored ligand (a MO with about 67% of population on the dye is found at −1.78 eV). Another beneficial effect of deprotonation seems to be the change in the nature of the highest occupied MO. The HOMO is in fact upshifted at −5.19 eV and it turns out to be strictly localized far from the surface, with no coupling (99% on the dye) with the TiO2 states and thus less prone to give recombination with injected electrons. However, operating in a strong basic environment in order to maintain the not-coordinated carboxylic group in its deprotonated form and thus inverting the direction of the lowest excited state charge flow, is not possible in practice without desorbing the grafted dyes from the substrate. Thus, omitting one of the carboxylic groups and moving to heteroleptic complexes appear to be the only feasible ways to prevent the deactivation pathway by promoting a unidirectional electron channel toward the semiconductor CB. We report in the bottom panel of Fig. 4 the calculated PDOS and plots of the frontier MOs for the heteroleptic analogous of C2 (termed C5 in Fig. 1). The results confirm the desired charge transfer nature of the lowest energy dye level and overall agree with the electronic structure reported in ref. 51 for the same complex adsorbed on a (TiO2)92 slab and calculated at the PBE0 level of theory.

For the depicted MOs the % contribution of population localized on the dye is also indicated. The gaussian broadening used to reproduce the PDOS is equal to 0.3 eV. Vertical sticks represent the Kohn–Sham eigenvalues and their intensity the % dye's population. 
3.3 Photovoltaic characterization of heteroleptic Fe(II)–NHC complexes
On the basis of the electronic structure of the C5@TiO2 complex discussed above, heteroleptic compounds should be able to effectively inject electrons into the semiconductor CB. We therefore prepared the three heteroleptic Fe(II)–carbene complexes C5, C6 and C7 (see Fig. 1 and the ESI† for preparation) and investigated their electronic and photovoltaic properties (Fig. 5 and Table 2). Besides C5, the heteroleptic analogous of C2, we also investigated the effect of electron-donating substituents such as anisyl and triphenyl amine on the NHC ligands C6 and C7 with the idea of (i) increasing the polarization of the dye and thus enhancing the electron transfer; (ii) maintaining the photo-generated hole far from the semiconductor surface to possibly limit the recapture of injected electrons.

The recorded UV-Vis spectra in acetonitrile (A), on the TiO2 film (B), the IPCE (C) and J/V (D) curves for all the heteroleptic complexes along with those of the reference C2 homoleptic complex are reported in Fig. 5, whereas Table 2 compiles the associated photovoltaic data. The UV-Vis absorption maxima in solution and on TiO2 as well as the redox properties of the complexes are collected in Table S1 in the ESI.†
The absorption spectra of the complexes in acetonitrile (Fig. 5A) clearly show the effect of the dissymmetric structure of the heteroleptic complexes. Indeed, while the homoleptic complex C2 exhibits two MLCT transitions in the visible domain at 394 nm (metal–carbene MLCT) and 520 nm (metal–pyridine MLCT), an additional MLCT band was observed for the heteroleptics at 430 nm.
In the visible region, complexes C5, C6 and C7 have a similar three-band spectrum with variations in the ε values, the anisyl substituent in complex C6 promoting a significant increase of the absorption. In the UV region compound C7 featured the characteristic intense band (296 nm, ε = 40600 M−1 cm−1) of the π–π* transition on the triphenylamine moiety.
The removal of one carboxylic acid going from C2 to the heteroleptic complexes induced a significant blue shift of the lowest energy transition band from 520 nm to ca. 509 nm, while the band at 394 nm corresponding to the metal–carbene transition52,54 remained unchanged. Thus the band at 430 nm in heteroleptic complexes can be attributed to the MLCT transition between the iron center and the ligand with the unsubstituted pyridine. Interestingly, the band at 509 nm appears to be much more intense than the others for every complex indicating that a higher amount of light energy was absorbed by the MLCT transition involving iron and the carboxypyridine. This augmented absorbance should in principle translate into higher IPCE values in DSSCs.
The absorption spectra of the sensitized electrodes (Fig. 5B) perfectly mimicked the solution spectra with the blue-shift of the MLCT band in heteroleptics compared with C2 and the best absorbance measured for complex C6. IPCE curves (Fig. 5C) showed that the dyes were able to harvest light and produce carriers along a wide absorption window. As a consequence of its better absorbance, complex C6 permitted to reach a 3% IPCE vs. 2.5% for C5 and the homoleptic C2.
As is apparent, however, from the J/V curves (Fig. 5D) and PV data in Table 2, despite possessing the desired interfacial charge separation characteristics the photovoltaic performances of the cells fabricated with all the heteroleptic derivatives did not show any improvement compared to the efficiency obtained with the homoleptic C2 complex (Table 1). The overall efficiencies of the cells fabricated with the heteroleptic complexes are around 0.1%, with photocurrent values of 0.33 (C5) and 0.36 (C6 and C7) mA cm−2. Comparable and even larger surface coverage values are also obtained, with the only exception of C7, bearing the bulkier triphenylamine substituents, thus comparable light harvesting capabilities for the sensitized-TiO2 films can be hypothesized. As a matter of fact, very low Voc values were also obtained, being in all cases around 400 mV, whereas the Voc measured for the N719 Ru(II) complex under the same operating conditions is around 690 mV (Table 2). These extremely low photovoltage and photocurrent values clearly suggest an unfavorable balance between the interfacial electron injection and recombination (with both oxidized dye and electrolyte)88 pathways. Concerning the recombination with the electrolyte, it is interesting to notice that such low Voc values resemble those reported in the literature for phthalocyanine89 and other purely organic and metal centred dyes90 in combination with the I−/I3− redox couple.91 These results are usually attributed to the possible formation of stable complexes92 between the aromatic ligands and/or particular functional groups and the electrolyte species. The formation of these adducts results in an increased concentration of iodine in proximity of the TiO2 surface, boosting the recombination probability. We also notice that the highly delocalized nature of the HOMO (hole in the oxidized dye), appearing in Fig. 3 and 4, and the markedly bent adsorption configuration (Fig. S1 in the ESI†) of these Fe(II)–NHC complexes might further favor the approach of the electrolyte to the semiconductor surface in the regeneration process.
3.4 Interfacial electron injection and recombination
On the basis of electronic structure calculations of the Fe(II)–NHC@TiO2 complexes discussed above and upon localization of the MOs on the dye and TiO2 fragments, we can quantitatively estimate the rates for both the electron injection from the dye's LUMO (or LUMO+1) into the CB states and hole injection from the dye's HOMO to the CB states (i.e. recombination to the oxidized dye). The results are depicted in Fig. 6 in terms of probability distribution Γ(k) and diabatic density of acceptor TiO2 states (see eqn (1)) along with the relevant dye energy levels, while Table 3 summarizes the calculated injection probabilities extracted at the energy of the donor states (LUMO/LUMO+1 and HOMO for electron injection and recombination, respectively). Since C5, C6 and C7 exhibited similar electronic properties we focused on C5 for a better comparison with its homoleptic counterpart C2. The energies of the corresponding diabatic levels, shown by vertical sticks in Fig. 6, are given in the ESI† (Table S2).

The relevant dye energy levels are also reported as vertical sticks.

A first comment concerns the homoleptic complexes (C2 and C4). In agreement with the electronic structure reported in Fig. 3 and discussed above, the plots in the top panel of Fig. 6 and the related data in Table 3 show that the electronic coupling between the dye's LUMO and the semiconductor CB states is negligible. The calculated Γ values extracted at the energy of the dye's donor state (LUMO) are of the order of 10−4 eV, resulting in calculated injection rates of about 1012 s−1. In other words, the electron injection is predicted to take place in the ps timescale, which is exactly the timescale for the deactivation of the 3MLCT state (16 ps and 26 ps, for C252 and C4,54 respectively). Notably our calculations are also able to provide a quantitative difference between C2 and C4, predicting for the latter a lower injection probability (Γ), over the whole manifold of CB states, possibly due to the higher delocalized character of the MOs induced by the presence of BIm substituents. As expected, on the other hand, the typical ultrafast injection mechanism characteristic of the Ru(II)–polypyridyl complexes is envisaged for LUMO+1, with Γ values of the order of 10−1 eV and injection rates of 1015 s−1 (fs timescale). Also in this case, for C4 a slower injection rate is calculated at the LUMO+1 energy level and the Γ curve is always lower than that calculated for C2 (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). As deprotonation of the not-coordinated COOH group inverts the energetic order between the LUMO and LUMO+1 levels, restoring the desired interfacial charge separation, Γ(εLUMO), for C2(D) is in the same order of magnitude of Γ(εLUMO+1) calculated for the protonated C2 (0.162 vs. 0.158 eV) and an injection rate in the fs timescale is predicted. It is worthwhile to notice in the middle panel of Fig. 6, that almost coincident Γ curves are obtained for the LUMO+1 of C2 (black) and LUMO of C2(D) (grey), confirming the identical nature of the diabatic states in the two systems. On the other hand, the injection probability distributions of the heteroleptic C5 complex (red curve in the middle panel of Fig. 6) indicates an appreciable change in the electronic structure, i.e. in the diabatic LUMO nature, delivering lower electronic coupling with the low-energy TiO2 CB states (where the LUMO is energetically located) and larger coupling with higher-energy states (around −1.5 eV). The electronic coupling elements calculated for the LUMO/LUMO+1 of C5/C2 and the TiO2 CB states are reported in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† Thus the calculated Γ(εLUMO) for C5 is more than one order of magnitude lower than that calculated for the deprotonated complex (0.010 vs. 0.162 eV), resulting in a longer injection time, lying in the range of several ps in the same time scale of the 3MLCT lifetimes of the heteroleptic complexes, measured at 14, 10 and 12 ps for C5, C6 and C7 respectively (see Fig. S6 and Table S3 in the ESI†).
Interesting insights also come from the hole injection Γ curves describing the recombination processes from the dye's HOMO to the TiO2 CB states (bottom panel of Fig. 6). In line with the typical measured ms time scales for Ru(II)–polypyridyl sensitizers, in our diabatic-like framework recombination to the oxidized dye is calculated to be extremely slow, as a consequence of the negligible energetic overlap between the dye HOMO and the TiO2 CB states. We however note that for C2, C5 and C4 (even if at a lower extent) the Γ plots (black, red and orange lines, respectively) and V values (eqn (1)) plotted in Fig. S4 and S5 in the ESI† indicate a sizeable electronic coupling with both the VB and CB states due to the above discussed high delocalization of the HOMO favoring electronic conjugation with the TiO2 MOs. This inefficient interfacial hole/charge separation suggests that in the complexity of the dye-sensitized TiO2 interface, where heterogeneous binding modes and supramolecular interactions alter the energetic alignment calculated here, the actual recombination rate to the oxidized dye might be higher, occurring in the nanosecond and even picosecond timescale, as reported in ref. 49. The hole injection (recombination) rate of C4 is however predicted to be three orders of magnitude faster than of those of C2 and C5 (107 s−1 to be compared to 104 s−1), as a consequence of the higher TiO2 DOS (see the number of states listed in Table 3). Then, as expected, the coupling for the HOMO of the deprotonated C2(D) is, instead, almost zero (see the solid grey curve in the bottom panel of Fig. 6), with a practically suppressed recombination rate, predicted to occur in the second timescale.
4. Summary and conclusions
Here we have reported for the first time a combined theoretical and experimental (photovoltaic) characterization of Fe(II)–carbene sensitized photoelectrodes in working solar cells. In addition to the already developed homoleptic Fe(II)–NHC C252 and C454 complexes (Fig. 1), the synthesis, characterization and photovoltaic application of three new heteroleptic Fe(II)–NHC dye sensitizers (C5, C6 and C7, Fig. 1) has been carried out. Despite an improved interfacial charge separation, the heteroleptic compounds did not show boosted photovoltaic performances compared to the homoleptic ones: photocurrent values of about 0.3–0.4 mA cm−2, Voc of ca. 400 mV and overall efficiency of 0.1% are obtained for all the investigated sensitizers. The quantitative analysis of the interfacial electron and hole transfers extracted from our quantum mechanical calculations, along with the measured photovoltaic data, clearly evidence the main problems associated with the poor device efficiencies and the main challenges that have to be faced to develop efficient iron-based sensitizers: (i) fast recombination reactions with both the oxidized dye and I−/I3− electrolyte appear as the main barrier to efficient Fe(II)–NHC dyes; (ii) homoleptic complexes do not present the desired directional electron flow toward the TiO2 surface in their lowest MLCT state; (iii) heteroleptic complex, although possessing the appropriate interfacial charge separation, are predicted to have lower electron injection rates when compared to the reference Ru(II)–polypyridyl complexes, yielding improved photocurrent and photovoltage values in working devices. Importantly, the calculations revealed that the deprotonation of the not anchored carboxylic function in the homoleptic C2 complex (C2(D)) promoted a notable speeding up of the electron injection (from the ps for C2 to the fs time scale for C2(D)) while suppressing the electron recombination. In this case, the interfacial hole/electron charge separation nicely resembles that of the reference N719 Ru(II) sensitizer. This result clearly indicates that the introduction of electron-donating substituents (as it is the case for the carboxylate function) on the not-anchored NHC ligand of heteroleptic complexes should be the route of choice to improve the overall interfacial charge generation and make iron-based dyes applicable for photoelectrochemical devices. Work is now in progress towards this direction.
