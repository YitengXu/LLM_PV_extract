    , Accepted 26th May 2020First published on 27th May 2020AbstractThe objective of this study was to report the preparation of a highly efficient hematite nanorod photoanode by H2 treatment of the β-FeOOH nanorod with subsequent quenching in air at lower temperature activation for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. The hematite nanorod photoanode (H650) prepared by thermally treating the β-FeOOH nanorod at 360 °C for 1 h under H2 flow and quenching at 650 °C for 10 min in air exhibited a remarkable photocurrent of 1.17 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which was 20 times higher than that of hematite quenched at the same temperature without H2 treatment. Such enhanced PEC performance was attributed to high Sn4+ diffusion from the fluorine doped SnO2 (FTO) substrate via H2 treatment and Sn4+ doping by subsequent lower temperature quenching. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculation supports our experimental results and proposed mechanism in that the Sn replacement reaction of magnetite (Fe3O4, H2-reduced β-FeOOH) occurs at a lower temperature and requires a smaller energy than that of akaganeite (β-FeOOH).
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen production by solar water splitting is one of the most studied methods to convert solar energy into clean hydrogen fuel for solving the energy and environmental crisis. Hematite (α-Fe2O3) is a low-cost, earth-abundant, and highly stable material with a suitable band gap for absorbing visible light efficiently in a PEC cell.1 However, several factors can limit the performance of hematite, including its poor electrical conductivity, short hole diffusion length, relatively low absorption coefficient, slow oxygen evolution kinetics, and large requested overpotential.2,3 Many efforts have been devoted to overcoming these limitations through nano-structuring and elemental doping. For example, one-dimensional hematite nanostructures (e.g., nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes, etc.) can effectively increase the short hole diffusion length while doping with metal atoms (e.g., Sn, Zr, Ti, Pt, etc.) can significantly improve the electronic conductivity of α-Fe2O3.4,5
Grätzel's group first reported that relatively high photocurrent densities for PEC water splitting could be achieved with a mesoporous α-Fe2O3 photoanode prepared by a solution-based colloidal method followed by annealing at 800 °C.6 The diffusion of Sn atoms from the fluorine doped SnO2 (FTO) substrate to α-Fe2O3 takes place at 800 °C, functioning as electron donating substitutional impurities (Sn4+).6 However, the increased particle size after high temperature calcination might have detrimental effects on charge separation because it causes serious agglomeration of the hematite nanostructure and damages the electrical conductivity of the FTO substrate.7 Thus, activation of the hematite photoanode at a relatively low temperature is highly desirable. In this regard, a post growth doping technique has been proposed, in which a Ti or Zr precursor solution is deposited on the α-Fe2O3 nanostructure followed by subsequent calcination in air at a lower temperature of 650–700 °C.8 By depositing a thin TiO2 layer on the FTO substrate for the subsequent growth of the α-Fe2O3 nanostructure, the activation temperature was reduced to 600 °C.9 A core–shell-type Fe2O3@FeNbO4 nanorod heterojunction on FTO for efficient PEC water splitting can be formed by hybrid microwave annealing at 400 °C.10 Surface sulfurized α-Fe2O3 nanorods show a photocurrent density increased by low-temperature (<600 °C) annealing in an argon (Ar) atmosphere.11 α-Fe2O3 prepared by anodization of thin iron layers on FTO glass and subsequent annealing in a low O2–Ar atmosphere was achieved at 600 °C.12
In the present work, a highly Sn-doped hematite nanorod photoanode was achieved for efficient PEC water oxidation with low-temperature activation. The Fe3O4 nanorod sample (H360) was prepared by thermally treating β-FeOOH at 360 °C for 1 h under H2 flow.13 Further, quenching of Fe3O4 at a relatively lower temperature (650 °C) resulted in drastic improvement in PEC performance of the hematite photoanode compared to that of β-FeOOH quenched under the same conditions. The enhanced PEC performance was attributed to a high level of Sn4+ doping due to H2 treatment and subsequent quenching in air. To elucidate this favorable effect of H2-annealing induced intrinsic Sn doping, an ex situ Sn-doped hematite photoanode was further synthesized by dipping β-FeOOH in SnCl4 solution followed by the same quenching processes. The hematite nanorod photoanode (H650) prepared from quenching of Fe3O4 at 650 °C exhibited a remarkable photocurrent of 1.17 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which far exceeded those of hematite photoanodes quenched from β-FeOOH at 650 °C (A650) and ex situ Sn-doped hematite (Sn650) quenched under the same conditions. The results of ab initio calculations were well correlated with our experimental data. The mechanism might be due to the Sn replacement reaction of magnetite (Fe3O4) at a lower temperature requiring a smaller energy than that of akaganeite (β-FeOOH). These findings demonstrate that lowering the activation temperature of the hematite nanorod photoanode via H2 treatment could be a practical strategy to construct a highly efficient PEC water oxidation system.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of hematite nanorod photoanodes
The β-FeOOH nanorod on the FTO substrate was prepared with a hydrothermal method as reported previously.14 As-synthesized β-FeOOH was further annealed in a tube furnace at 360 °C for 1 h with a pure H2 (99.99%) flow rate of 100 mL min−1, and denoted as Fe3O4 (H2-reduced β-FeOOH). In the following step, the Fe3O4 sample was subjected to quenching in ambient air at different temperatures (650, 700, 750, and 800 °C) for 10 min, and denoted as H650, H700, H750 and H800, respectively (H-type samples). β-FeOOH was also quenched in ambient air at 650, 700, 750, and 800 °C for 10 min, and denoted as A650, A700, A750 and A800, respectively (A-type samples).
2.2 Characterization
The crystalline structures of the as-prepared samples were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. XRD data were obtained with X-rays of 0.1072 nm wavelength (λ) in θ–2θ mode at the 5A Materials Science beamline of Pohang Light Source II (PLS-II). The surface morphologies of the hematite photoanodes were investigated with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Carl Zeiss AG-SUPRA 40, Germany). Structural and chemical analyses of the H650 sample were performed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, ARM-200F) operating at 200 kV and equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The elemental composition and chemical state of these as-synthesized samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Quantera II, PHI) using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. The optical properties of the as-synthesized samples were studied by ultraviolet-visible diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS) via a dual beam spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu). X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) was examined on the 7D beamline of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PLS-II, 3.0 GeV, 360 mA). Spectra for Fe K-edge (E0 = 7112 eV) were collected in fluorescence mode under a helium atmosphere at room temperature. The incident beam was detuned by 20% at 7112 eV to minimize the flux from higher order Bragg diffractions of Si(111) crystals in the monochromator. The intensity was monitored with a He-filled IC SPEC ionization chamber and the fluorescence signal was measured with a Lytle type detector combined with PIPS (passivated implanted planar silicon). Obtained data were processed using ATHENA in the IFEFFIT suite of programs.15 The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) study was performed on a confocal microscope (Picoquant, MicroTime-200, Germany). A single-mode pulsed diode laser (Picoquant, LDH-P-C-470, Germany) with a 0.5 mW average power, ∼30 ps pulse width, and 20 MHz repetition rate was applied as the excitation source. A dichroic mirror (490 DCXR, AHF), a long-pass filter (HQ500lp, AHF), and a single photon avalanche diode (PDM series, MPD) were employed to measure photon emission from specimens. The time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique was applied to count the emitted photons. Exponential fitting for the obtained PL decays with 8 ps resolution was done by iterative least-squares fitting using the Symphotime-64 software (Ver. 2.2). PL decay fitting was done with a bi-exponential decay model, I(t) = ∑Aie−t/τi where I(t) is the time-dependent PL intensity, A is the amplitude, τ is the PL lifetime, and i is 1, 2. The averaged lifetime, 〈τ〉, was defined by .16
2.3 Computational methodology
Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)17–19 with the local-density approximation (LDA)20,21 method. On-site Coulomb repulsion parameters, Ueff = 8 eV and 5 eV, respectively, were used for the iron ions of magnetite (Fe3O4) and akaganeite (β-FeOOH). On-site exchange interaction parameter Jeff = 1 eV was used for the iron ions of both minerals.22–24 A kinetic energy cutoff of 450 eV was used with a plane-wave basis set. Brillouin zone integrations were conducted using a 12 × 12 × 12 Monkhorst–Pack grid25 with first-order Methfessel–Paxton smearing26 at a width of 0.1 eV. All atoms were fully relaxed and optimized until the total energy change upon two steps of electronic self-consistency was less than 10−4 eV and the ionic relaxation loop was smaller than 10−3 eV. Magnetite and akaganeite have structures with the space group Fdm27,28 and space group I2/m,23,29 respectively. For DFT calculations, 8 formula units (f.u.) of magnetite ((Fe3O4)8)14 and 8 f.u. of akaganeite ((FeOOH)8)8 were used for their supercells. As depicted in Scheme 1, a cubic supercell of 8.27 × 8.27 × 8.27 Å, α = β = γ = 90° and a monoclinic supercell of 10.11 × 3.03 × 10.56 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 91.3° with periodic boundary conditions were used for magnetite and akaganeite, respectively. To compare the thermodynamic stability upon the replacement of Fe with Sn in minerals, the following three energies were calculated (eqn (1)–(3)): Sn replacement energy (Erep, i.e., the energy required to replace an Fe ion of minerals with a Sn ion), Fe vacancy formation energy (Evac, i.e., the energy required to make a vacancy by removing an Fe ion from minerals), and Sn insertion energy (Eins, i.e., the energy required to insert a Sn atom into the vacancy site). Each energy of magnetite and akaganeite was represented by subscripts of “_M” and “_A”, respectively (for example, Erep_M and Erep_A). Erep = (ESn/mineral + EFe) − (Emineral + ESn)(1) Evac = (Evac/mineral + EFe) − Emineral(2) Eins = ESn/mineral − (Evac/mineral + ESn)(3)where ESn/mineral and Evac/mineral are the total energies of minerals with Sn replaced and minerals with Fe vacancies, respectively. EFe and ESn are the total energies of bulk Fe and Sn divided by the number of each atom in each unit cell, respectively. Relatively lower (i.e. smaller) Erep, Evac and Eins energies indicate relatively more exothermic reactions.

Cyan, brown, red, light green and white spheres represent tetrahedral-site Fe, octahedral-site Fe, O, Cl and H, respectively. 
2.4 PEC measurements
A three-electrode electrochemical cell was used for PEC measurements with hematite photoanodes as the working electrode, Pt coil as the counter electrode, and Hg/HgO as the reference electrode. 1.0 M NaOH solution (pH 13.6) was used as an electrolyte. Current density–potential (J–V) characteristics were measured using an Ivium CompactStat potentiostat, with illumination using a solar simulator (Abet Technologies, Model LS 150). The potential was calculated with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the Nernst equation as below: (4)
Photocurrent density–voltage curves were obtained from 0.3 V vs. RHE to 1.7 V vs. RHE with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted with an AC amplitude of 20 mV at 1.23 V vs. RHE from 3000 kHz to 0.5 Hz under illumination. The Mott–Schottky (MS) plots (real vs. imaginary impedance) of the samples were collected from 0.4 V vs. RHE to 1.4 V vs. RHE in the frequency range of 100 Hz under dark conditions. The intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) analysis was performed using a green LED with a peak wavelength of 520 nm, driven by a frequency-response analyzer. The frequency was swept from 10 kHz down to 0.1 Hz. The IMPS spectra were recorded by small amplitude (10%) variable frequency sinusoidal modulations of the light intensity.30
The bulk charge separation efficiency (ηbulk) and surface charge separation efficiency (ηsurface) of A700 and H700 photoanodes were estimated by the photo-oxidation of 0.5 M H2O2 as a hole scavenger. The ηbulk was calculated using the following equation31 JH2O = Jabs × ηbulk × ηsurface(5)where Jabs is the photon absorption expressed as a current density (i.e., absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) = 100%) and JH2O is the measured photocurrent density. The ηbulk and ηsurface can be determined by: ηbulk = JH2O2/Jabs(6) ηsurface = JH2O/JH2O2(7)where JH2O2 is the photocurrent density in the presence of H2O2.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a and b show the XRD patterns of A-type and H-type samples. All XRD patterns of A-type and H-type samples were indexed to hematite (α-Fe2O3; JCPDS 33-0664) and the FTO substrate. Each sample displayed a prominent (110) diffraction peak, suggesting the preferred orientation for the electron transport in the hematite nanorod.29 However, A-type samples showed relatively narrower and stronger (110) peaks than H-type samples, indicating the higher crystallinity related to large crystals and/or smaller micro-strains of A-type samples. The relatively lower crystallinities of H-type samples matched with the existence of defects (Fe2+) in their structures.32 To separate the crystal size and micro-strain effect from peak broadening, Williamson–Hall analysis was applied (Fig. 1c–f). The results are summarized in Table S1.† A-type samples had ∼34% larger crystals than H-type samples. These two types of samples almost kept all their original crystal sizes with increasing quenching temperature, whereas the initial micro-strains decreased for both types of samples. Moreover, A-type samples underwent a remarkable micro-strain reduction of 68% with increasing quenching temperature which significantly contributed to the sharp and strong (110) peak (Fig. 1a). Additionally, as shown in Fig. S1,† the XRD data of yellow films obtained from the hydrothermal reaction can be indexed to characteristic peaks of β-FeOOH (akaganeite, JCPDS 75-1594). Blackish films prepared by H2 treatment showed characteristic peaks of Fe3O4 (magnetite; JCPDS 19-0629). β-FeOOH and Fe3O4 films were then quenched in air at different temperatures (650, 700, 750, and 800 °C) for 10 min, respectively. To investigate the incorporation of Sn4+via diffusion from the FTO substrate into the hematite crystal structure after quenching of β-FeOOH and Fe3O4 at different temperatures (650–800 °C), XPS analyses were performed. Fig. 2 shows the XPS spectra of Sn3d, Fe2p, and O1s regions obtained from A-type (A650, A700, and A800) and H-type (H650, H700, and H800) samples. Fig. 2a shows that A-type samples (A700, A800) and all H-type samples exhibited peaks centered at 494.8 and 486.4 eV corresponding to signals of SnO2, indicating that these hematite samples were substitutionally doped with Sn4+ ions.33 No Sn was detected in the film of the β-FeOOH nanorod (Fig. S2†). This means that Sn4+ is obtained from the FTO substrate during thermal H2 treatment. Very few amounts of Sn were observed in sample A650 (Fig. 2a), indicating that the quenching temperature required to diffuse Sn4+ from the FTO substrate would be more than 650 °C. As expected, much higher amounts of Sn4+ dopants were achieved with higher quenching temperature. The amounts of Sn4+ were particularly higher on the surface of hematite quenched from Fe3O4 compared to those on the surface of hematite quenched from β-FeOOH. Their intensity also increased with increasing quenching temperature. As shown in Table S2,† Sn% in H650 (2.66%) was much higher than that in A650 (0.09%), suggesting that Sn4+ was successfully doped into the hematite crystal structure of H650. This high level of Sn4+ in hematite prepared from Fe3O4 was due to Sn4+ diffusion into the surface of Fe3O4 from the FTO substrate during thermal H2 treatment.13 These results suggest that such enhanced diffusion from the FTO substrate and doping of Sn4+ into the hematite nanostructure can have a drastic effect on the photoelectrochemical activity of the hematite photoelectrodes. As shown in Fig. 2b, all A-type and H-type samples exhibited doublet (Fe2p3/2 and Fe2p1/2) peaks at binding energies of 711.2 and 724.8 eV. In addition, the Fe2p3/2 satellite peak (octahedral Fe3+) appeared at 719.0 eV, indicating the formation of a pure α-Fe2O3 phase.34 However, the intensity of this satellite peak was diminished when a larger amount of Sn4+ was incorporated into H-type samples. This loss of satellite resolution of Fe3+ might be due to the overlapping of the Fe2+ satellite at approximately 716.0 eV. This provides evidence that Sn4+ elements occupy the atomic sites of Fe3+ in the crystal structure, leading some Fe2+ species in Fe2O3 to adjust their charge balance.35 In addition, O1s peaks were observed as one main peak at around 530.0 eV (Fig. 2c), consistent with that of hematite.36 These observations are in good agreement with the results of XRD analysis.

Top and cross-sectional FESEM images of the β-FeOOH nanorods thermally quenched from 650 °C to 800 °C in ambient air are presented in Fig. S3A.† The quenching process converted β-FeOOH into α-Fe2O3, resulting in a morphology of fused worm-like nanorods with a diameter of ∼60 nm for A650 and A700, similar to that of the β-FeOOH nanorod (Fig. S4a†). As the quenching temperature rose, the diameter of the nanorods gradually increased (∼70 nm for A750 and ∼100 nm for A800) due to aggregation during the quenching process. There were no significant changes in the length of the nanorods (∼500 nm) with increasing quenching temperature. On the other hand, H2 annealing of β-FeOOH at 360 °C changed the morphology of the β-FeOOH nanorod with grain growth, whereas the average featured size was preserved for the as-prepared Fe3O4 sample (Fig. S4a and b†). With the increase of quenching temperature from 650 °C to 800 °C, these grains started to melt and retransformed into smooth nanorods as shown in Fig. S3B.† Note that H650, H700, H750, and H800 possessed nearly the same diameter of ca. 60 nm with a length of ca. 500 nm. Unlike the β-FeOOH nanorod, Fe3O4 kept the diameter of the nanorods unchanged although these nanorods were also subjected to a high-temperature quenching. This extraordinary nanorod structure with a high aspect ratio has advantages as a photoelectrode because it ensures efficient light absorption and minimizes the distance for holes to diffuse to the interface of the semiconductor and electrolyte.37 In addition, a more sparse distribution of nanorods was observed for both types of samples with an increase of quenching temperature.
TEM analysis of the H650 sample was also performed to investigate its morphology, crystallization, and dopant Sn distribution. The TEM image of the H650 nanorod shows a unique porous morphology (Fig. 3a), suggesting that the nanograins formed during thermal H2 treatment were fused into interconnected small nanorods during quenching at 650 °C. The HR-TEM image in Fig. 3b indicated that the H650 sample had a single crystalline structure which was well maintained as the crystal structure of α-Fe2O3 with a growth direction of (110) (d-spacing 2.52 Å). Fast Fourier transformation (FFT) results confirmed that the H650 sample had a single crystal structure in the atomic arrangement as shown in the inset of Fig. 3b. The corresponding EDS elemental mapping results also demonstrated that O, Fe, and Sn elements were all uniformly distributed in the H650 nanorod (Fig. 3c).

XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge structure) and EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) were applied to investigate the local electronic and geometric structures of Fe in A-type and H-type samples. The rising absorption feature in Fe K-edge XANES is associated with an electronic transition from a core level of 1s to empty states of p-type. As shown in Fig. 4a, samples A650 and H650 exhibited increased intensities in the vicinity of the absorption edge (7128–7127 eV) compared to the reference Fe2O3 powder. This indicates that the two-dimensional confined film structure has more surfaces suffering from a shortage of electrons. A very small change was observed between H-type and A-type samples. The slightly decreased intensities (less electron-deficient) for H650 were well correlated with the XPS results showing that the Fe2+ state was observed in H-type samples. The EXAFS spectra for each pair of H-type and A-type samples were compared as shown in Fig. 4b. The first peak at 0.6–2.0 Å was ascribed to two nearest Fe–O bonds. The second peak at 2.0–3.8 Å contained complicated Fe–Fe and Fe–O scatterings in a higher shell. All peak intensities for A650 were slightly higher by up to 6 Å than those for H650, indicating that the structural orderings of all bonds for H650 got a little worse. This difference became weak as the quenching temperature increased. The degradation of structural ordering for H-type samples was due to enhanced Sn4+ doping into the hematite lattice from the FTO substrate.

The optical properties of the as-prepared hematite photoanodes were investigated using UV-vis spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S5,† no significant difference in the absorption spectrum of each photoanode was observed. In addition, the absorption wavelength edges fitted well with α-Fe2O3. In the inset of Fig. S5,† the electrode band gap was estimated through the Tauc method: (αhν)(1/n) = A(hν − Eg), where α is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, ν is the photon's frequency, n is an exponent dependent on the nature of electronic transitions (n = 2 for direct transition), A is a proportionality constant, and Eg is the band gap.6 All the hematite photoanodes displayed similar band gaps of 2.1–2.2 eV (Table S3†), in accordance with typical values of α-Fe2O3.3

Fig. 5a compares the PEC performances of the α-Fe2O3 photoanodes quenched at different temperatures. The photoanode quenched at 650 °C (A650) showed a negligible photocurrent of less than 50 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. This is consistent with previous results obtained from hydrothermally grown hematite nanorods.8 The quenching temperature required to diffuse Sn4+ from the FTO substrate and activate the hematite for high water splitting efficiency by the solution-based methods has been reported to be around 800 °C.6 Obviously, A700, A750, and A800 samples exhibited gradually improved photoresponse. A drastic change in PEC performance occurred with the hematite photoanodes quenched from Fe3O4 as shown in Fig. 5b. The water oxidation photocurrent of H650 began at about 1.0 V vs. RHE, increasing to 1.17 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and passing 1.59 mA cm−2 before the dark current onset (ca. 1.60 V vs. RHE). These values were quite high compared to those of other hematite photoanodes post-annealed at the same temperature (650 °C) or even at higher temperatures.38 These improvements are more pronounced for samples with higher quenching temperature due to their higher dopant concentrations. Additionally, higher sintering temperature (700, 800 °C) has detrimental effects on the conductivity of the FTO substrate. Sintering induces the diffusion of Sn from the F-doped SnO2 (FTO) into the hematite lattice, enhancing the photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of the hematite photoanodes.39 Results of XPS analyses revealed a strong correlation between the Sn4+ doping concentration and photocurrent density of hematite. The photocurrents of A-type and H-type samples at 1.23 V vs. RHE and 1.40 V vs. RHE from J–V curves were compared. The results shown in Table S4† revealed that the energy barrier associated with hematite activation was greater for β-FeOOH compared to that for Fe3O4. However, quenching of Fe3O4 shifted the onset potential of photocurrent to the anodic direction by ∼0.2 V vs. RHE. This anodic shift was most likely due to surface trapping states. It has been reported that defective surfaces are correlated with high onset potentials.40

Charge transfer processes were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis (Fig. 5c and d). All the hematite photoanodes were best fitted according to an equivalent resistor–capacitor (RC) circuit model in the inset of Fig. 5c, consisting of the charge transfer resistances (R) across the interface within the photoanode and the constant phase element (CPE) in parallel. RS represents the series resistance which mainly including the sheet resistance of the FTO substrate, the electrolyte, and external contact. Two RC circuits represent the bulk α-Fe2O3 (R1 & CPE1) and interface between α-Fe2O3||electrolyte (R2 & CPE2).41 As shown in fitted results (Table 1), the resistance type RS slightly increased with increasing quenching temperature from 650 °C to 800 °C for both types of samples. Quenching of the β-FeOOH nanorod at elevated temperatures remarkably reduced the charge transfer and resistances of all the hematite photoanodes including the bulk α-Fe2O3 and the interface between α-Fe2O3||electrolyte. R1 decreased from 2669 to 268.1 Ω (90%) and R2 decreased from 1000 to 247.7 Ω (75%) as the quenching temperature increased from 650 °C to 800 °C. For H650, R1 showed a 94% decline in charge transfer resistance of bulk α-Fe2O3 and R2 showed an 87% decrease in charge transfer resistance of the interface between α-Fe2O3||electrolyte compared to A650, explaining its superior performance for water oxidation. This descending tendency was more pronounced when the quenching temperature of Fe3O4 was increased. Specially, H800 showed a slightly increased charge transfer resistance of the interface between α-Fe2O3||electrolyte compared with H750, explaining the higher anodic shift of the onset potential for H800. The variation of charge transfer resistance from EIS data was well correlated with changes in Sn4+ diffusion concentration and PEC performance.

To further investigate the role of Sn4+ doping, Mott–Schottky (MS) analysis was performed at 100 Hz. According to the MS plots shown in Fig. 5e and f, all the hematite photoanodes showed positive slopes that were characteristic of n-type semiconductors.42 The donor density (ND) can be determined with the following equation: ND = (2/e0εε0)[d(1/C2)dV]−1, where, e0 is the electron charge (1.602 × 10−19 C), ε is the dielectric constant of hematite (80), ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), and C is the capacitance derived from the electrochemical impedance obtained at each potential (V).43 The better performing photoanode had a gentler slope, implying that it had a higher donor density. As shown in Table S5,† the determined donor density was estimated to be in the order of 1019–1020 cm−3, consistent with a literature report on thermally activated hematite.44 Obviously, quenching at elevated temperatures was effective in improving the electrical conductivity of hematite photoanodes by increasing their donor density. Note that quenching of Fe3O4 resulted in a more favorable donor density compared to that of β-FeOOH. The donor density appeared to have significant correlations with Sn4+ concentration and PEC performance.
To study the photoactive wavelength region of A700 and H700 photoanodes, incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement was carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 6a. IPCE can be calculated using the equation given elsewhere.45 The IPCE values of the H700 photoanode (∼6.38%) are significantly higher than those of A700 photoanode (∼0.93%). This result suggests that H2-annealing induced the enhancement of PEC performance for the H700 photoanode. As shown in Fig. 6b, the H700 photoanode exhibits a maximum applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of 0.09% at 1.1 V vs. RHE, which is also higher than that of A700 (0.02% at 1.05 V vs. RHE), further demonstrating the positive effect of H2 treatment on α-Fe2O3.46 The increased photoconversion efficiency of H700 could be attributed to the increase in electrical conductivity from the high level of Sn4+ doping due to H2 treatment. To investigate the Sn doping effect on the charge separation properties, a charge separation efficiency test in the bulk (ηbulk) and on the surface (ηsurface) of A700 and H700 photoanodes was performed under 1 sun illumination using 1 M NaOH electrolyte with 0.5 M H2O2 solution.47Fig. 6c shows that the value of ηbulk of H700 (57% at 1.5 V vs. RHE) is higher than the ηbulk of the A700 sample (34% at 1.5 V vs. RHE), which indicates that the high level of Sn4+ doping induced the improvement of the bulk charge separation property in the H700 photoanode due to suppressed charge recombination. Fig. 6d indicates that there is no significant change in ηsurface and H2 treatment does not modify the surface of the photoanodes.

To activate hematite photoanodes, Sn incorporation into α-Fe2O3via diffusion has been found to be critical.48 In our previous studies, ex situ Sn-doped hematite nanorod photoanodes have shown noticeably improved PEC performance compared to pristine hematite.49 To understand the origin of the favorable effect of H2-annealing induced intrinsic Sn doping compared to ex situ Sn-doping, we further prepared ex situ Sn-doped hematite samples by dipping β-FeOOH nanorods in 5 mM SnCl4 solution for 2 min. These immersed samples of Sn-β-FeOOH were then dried with N2 purging and quenched at 650 and 700 °C for 10 min, then denoted as Sn650 and Sn700, respectively. As shown in Fig. S6a,† H650 displayed an abrupt jump in photocurrent by more than one order of magnitude compared with A650 and Sn650. To the best of our knowledge, this is the champion hematite photoanode produced through solution techniques under the same post-heat treatment conditions (Table S6†). In Fig. S6b,† H700 resulted in a six-fold increase in the photocurrent, while the ex situ Sn doped sample (Sn700) yielded only a three-fold increase in photocurrent compared to A700 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. H2-Annealing induced intrinsic Sn doping indeed showed excellent activity for solar water splitting, far exceeding ex situ Sn-doping. The large difference in the behavior of H650 and Sn650 samples confirms that different dopant sources and doping processes are required for the activation of Fe3O4 and Sn-β-FeOOH. Annealing Fe3O4 at a lower temperature of 650 °C is sufficient to incorporate Sn4+ induced from the FTO substrate by H2 annealing into the hematite lattice.
Further, Fig. S7(a and b)† illustrates the photoelectrochemical performance of the H700 and A700 photoanodes. The photocurrent density of H700 was dramatically improved than that of A700. This is due to the increased Sn4+ diffusion into the hematite photoanodes from FTO substrates during the high-temperature quenching process. The stability of the photoelectrodes was tested in 1.0 M NaOH under AM 1.5 G illumination in continuous operation for 1 h (Fig. S8†). The H700 photoanode shows 99% stability during PEC measurements for 1 h at 1.40 V vs. RHE. The H700 photoelectrode maintained a photocurrent density of approximately 1.75 mA cm−2 at 1.40 V vs. RHE, and this is in accordance with the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve.
To find the basis of the enhancement of the photocurrent and the electron transport in the photoanode, IMPS analysis was performed. Fig. S9† shows the complex plane plots of the IMPS spectrum of A700 and H700 measured at 1.20 V vs. RHE. The electron-transport time (τd) can be obtained from the IMPS result by using the following formula.50 τd = 1/(2πf(min(IMPS)))(8)where fmin(IMPS) is the frequency at the imaginary minimum. The τd values of A700 and H700 are 356 μs and 252 μs, respectively, suggesting that the electron-transfer rate of H700 is higher than that of the air annealed sample A700. This is because of the higher Sn4+ diffusion from the FTO substrate and the reduced strain, which further contribute to the smaller resistance of H700 compared with that of A700.46 The increased conductivity of H700 prepared from quenching H2-reduced β-FeOOH in ambient air at 700 °C contributes to its higher PEC activity than that of A700.

Fig. 7 shows the time-resolved PL characteristics of A650, A700, H650, and H700. The observed decay curves were well fitted by two exponential functions. The resulting fitted parameters are presented in Table S7.† The short-lived component had a lifetime of 0.22–0.24 ns while the long-lived lifetime component showed a lifetime of 3.3–4.6 ns. We carefully assigned the short-lived component to the direct electron–hole recombination process associated with a non-radiative trapping pathway,51,52 whereas the long-lived component was assigned to electron–hole recombination through localized trapped electronic states.53 For all the samples, the short-lived component lifetime was nearly unchanged while the long-lived component showed a prolonged lifetime when they were treated with higher quenching temperature and H2 pre-annealing. The average lifetime was increased in the order A650 < A700 < H650 < H700. This indicated that electron–hole separation occurred efficiently in hematite samples treated with higher quenching temperature. It was more efficient with H2 pre-annealing. Interestingly, this averaged lifetime was well correlated with the photocurrent density. Efficiently-separated charge carriers at surface trap states might be responsible for the higher photocurrent density from hematite nanorod photoanodes with higher quenching temperature and H2 pre-annealing.

In previous reports, the conventional synthesis of α-Fe2O3 films on the FTO glass substrate requires heat treatment at about 800 °C to induce sufficient Sn4+ diffusion from FTO into the α-Fe2O3 lattice, resulting in serious glass deformation. A small amount of Sn element in the FTO substrate started to diffuse at 650 °C, causing a slight increase in the photocurrent of α-Fe2O3. Therefore, 650 °C was considered as the optimum doping temperature to minimize glass deformation.54 Moreover, as an energy-intensive process, the high-temperature activation step would inevitably increase the manufacturing cost of devices, which is not desired for practical application. Therefore, low-temperature activation of hematite photoanodes is appreciated.32 It would be highly beneficial to have a simple H2 pre-annealing method followed by relatively low-temperature quenching to induce intrinsic elemental doping of hematite photoanodes without involving a high temperature. The capability of activating hematite at lower temperature is very important for the practical fabrication of highly photoactive hematite electrodes.
Spin-polarized theoretical calculations were performed by means of DFT to investigate the proposed mechanisms. The equilibrium lattice constant of magnetite was predicted to be 8.272 Å, which agreed well with both experimental values of 8.39 Å (ref. 55 and 56) (an error percent (ε) = −1.40%) and DFT-calculated values of 8.387 and 8.4 Å (ε = −1.51–−1.36%).15,57 In the case of akaganeite, it includes Cl− ions of various occupancies charge-balanced by co-sorbed protons (H+). Thus, the lattice parameters are varied depending on the Cl− occupancy.32 Considering the reasonable reproducibility of lattice parameters, the current study used a supercell with two Cl− and H+ ions (Fe8O16H8Cl2H2; a = 10.558 Å, b = 3.027 Å, c = 10.109 Å, α = γ = 90°, β = 91.3°), which agreed well with both experimental values58–60 of a = 10.48–10.6 Å (ε = −0.40–0.73%), b = 3.023–3.066 Å (ε = −1.28–0.14%), c = 10.47–10.513 Å (ε = −4.00–−3.57%), β = 89.4–90.24° (ε = 1.16–2.08%) and DFT-calculated values24,60–62 of a = 10.48–10.6 Å (ε = −0.40–0.73%), b = 3.023–3.034 Å (ε = −0.22–0.14%), c = 10.48–10.513 Å (ε = −4.00–−3.67%), β = 90.24° (ε = 1.16%). More information of akaganeite structures with various Cl− occupancies is described in ESI† DFT section 1 (Fig. S10).
Akaganeite (β-FeOOH) includes eight Fe atoms in the supercell occupying octahedral sites. On the other hand, in the magnetite supercell, 16 Fe atoms occupy octahedral sites. The remaining 8 Fe atoms are located in tetrahedral sites. As a result of Bader charge analysis, the Fe atoms of akaganeite showed various Bader charge values of 6.287–6.458e, while the magnetite (Fe3O4) showed Bader charge values of 6.449e at the octahedral-site and 6.341e at the tetrahedral-site. Based on the charge information, the Fe sites to be substituted with Sn were determined as described in Scheme 1 (more information of the Bader charges in ESI† DFT section 2; Tables S8 and S9).

Table 2 summarizes the Erep, Evac, and Eins of magnetite and akaganeite. Erep_M (Sn–Fe23O32; −2.91 eV) was lower than Erep_A (Sn–Fe7O16H8–Cl2H2; −0.61 eV), indicating that the reaction of substituting Sn for Fe was more preferable or more stable in magnetite than in akaganeite. In more detail, the Erep is the sum of Evac and Eins. In other words, the replacement of Fe by Sn requires the formation of Fe vacancies (Evac) followed by the insertion of Sn (Eins). The Evac values of both magnetite and akaganeite were positive, implying an endothermic reaction. However, the Eins values of both magnetite and akaganeite were negative, indicating an exothermic reaction. This implies that the Fe vacancy formation reaction would be the reaction-limiting step. The lower Evac of magnetite (Evac_M = 1.92 eV) than that of akaganeite (Evac_A = 6.66 eV) might support the experimental results of the current study in that the Sn replacement reaction of magnetite occurred at a lower temperature requiring a smaller energy than that of akaganeite. Also, the Sn insertion into the vacancy site of akaganeite (Eins_A = −7.27 eV) was more preferable than that into the vacancy site of magnetite (Eins_M = −4.82 eV), although both were exothermic reactions.

The origin of the lower value of Evac_M than Evac_A can be understood in comparative analysis of the density of states (DOS) of the Fe atoms located at vacancy sites of magnetite and akaganeite. In general, the electron density near the Fermi level plays an important role in chemical interactions.63–65 Electron orbitals near the Fermi level not only easily transfer electrons from the valence band (i.e., the orbitals below the Fermi level) to other molecules, but also accept electrons in the conduction band (i.e., the orbitals above the Fermi level) from others. As shown in Fig. 8A, the electron density of magnetite Fe 3d near the Fermi level was relatively higher than that of akaganeite (especially in the valance band region), implying that the Fe atom removal would occur more easily in magnetite than in akaganeite, consistent with the lower value of Evac_M (1.92 eV) than Evac_A (6.66 eV). Similarly, the lower value of Eins_A than Eins_M can be understood in the DOS analysis of O 2p states located beside the Fe vacancy sites because Sn insertion into the Fe vacancy sites would be influenced by the electron states of the O atoms adjacent to the location at which Sn is inserted. As shown in Fig. 8B, the electron density of the akaganeite O 2p near the Fermi level was relatively higher (especially in the conduction band region) than that of magnetite, indicating a relatively easier environment for Sn insertion in akaganeite than in magnetite. Additionally, the stable replacement of Sn in the minerals was confirmed by orbital (4d and 5p) hybridization of replaced Sn with 3d Fe and 2p O of minerals as shown in ESI† DFT section 3 (Fig. S11).

Spin up and down are represented as positive and negative values, respectively. The Fermi energy is referenced as 0 eV. 
Based on the above discussion, a possible mechanism for clarifying the lower temperature activation of hematite nanorod photoanodes via H2 treatment is illustrated in Fig. 9. Lower temperature quenching of the β-FeOOH nanorod results in a poor photo-activity of the hematite photoanode (A650) due to the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, considering nearly no Sn4+ doping into α-Fe2O3 at 650 °C. On the other hand, the H2 reduced β-FeOOH (Fe3O4) nanorod itself possesses a high level of Sn4+ diffusion from the FTO substrate. Although it is quenched at low temperature (650 °C), the level of Sn4+ doping for H650 is still very high compared to that for A650. This high level doping of Sn4+ is beneficial for effective charge transfer among α-Fe2O3, which explains the outstanding PEC performance of the H650 photoanode.

4. Conclusions
A simple approach of lowering the activation temperature of hematite photoanodes was successfully developed. Through H2 treatment, the phase of primarily prepared β-FeOOH was reduced to Fe3O4 while Sn4+ was considerably diffused from the FTO substrate. Further, quenching of Fe3O4 at a temperature as low as 650 °C converted the Fe3O4 phase into α-Fe2O3 and enabled Sn4+ doping into the α-Fe2O3 lattice to activate the hematite photoanode for efficient PEC water oxidation. Application of this simple strategy can boost photocurrents of hematite photoanodes without the need for high-temperature (800 °C) quenching commonly used in previous work. The obtained hematite photoanode H650 achieved an outstanding photocurrent density of 1.17 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which was the highest photocurrent density ever reported for hematite photoanodes at the same heat treatment temperature. Theoretical calculations suggested that the Sn replacement reaction of magnetite occurred at a lower temperature requiring a smaller energy than that of akaganeite. This work provides important insights into how H2 treatment can lower the minimum activation temperature of hematite photoanodes to 650 °C. The findings will open up a new opportunity to activate hematite materials at a lower temperature.
