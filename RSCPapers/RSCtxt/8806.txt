In this work, we employed a feasible spin-coating process to prepare copper defect compensation in CH3NH3PbI3. The related work function was shown to shift with the copper doping density by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Next, we applied transient surface photovoltage (TSPV) spectroscopy and first-order series reactions simulations to confirm that interface charge recombination at the ITO/perovskite junction can be eliminated through Cu+ doping. Nanoelectric photoconductive AFM analysis showed enhanced charge transfer and a higher photovoltage at the ITO/Cu-perovskite junction. Owing to efficient Fermi level alignment, the ITO/(CH3NH3)1−xCuxPbI3/PCBM/Ag devices displayed high power conversion efficiencies of 15.14 ± 0.67% at ambient conditions for inverted perovskite solar cells without any hole transport layer.
Introduction
Solar energy conversion techniques heavily rely on earth-abundant materials, such as the prevalent Si or more recently utilized halogen perovskites,1 to realize cost-effective devices,2,3 in which band structure alignments are optimized to facilitate charge collection at the interfaces. Since 2009, due to their many advantages,4–9 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have seen a rapid improvement in power conversation efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% to 19.3–22.1%.10,11 Interestingly, the device configuration has quickly evolved from sensitized to heterojunction solar cells,12,13 with ionic diffusion/migration14 still existing as the liquid system. In typical sandwiched hole-transport-layer (HTL)/perovskite/ETL devices,15 a p–i–n junction is fabricated to facilitate charge collection, where HTL and ETL are a p-type hole-transport layer and n-type electron-transport layer, respectively. Taking HTL as an example, devices with outstanding performance have been achieved on highly expensive doped spiro-MeOTAD,16 PTAA, or PEDOT:PSS polymers.8,17–19 Later, economical inorganic substitutes, such as NiO,20 CuI,21 CuPc,22 CuSCN,23,24 and carbon soot,25 have also been successfully applied as hole collectors. Generally, these key heterojunction designs rely on suitable band edge alignment with the perovskite for efficient charge separation and lower recombination,16,26–28 through either a slightly lower ETL conduction band minimum (CBM),29 or slightly higher HTL valence band maximum (VBM).23 However, fabricating suitable interfacial layers with high light transparency, charge diffusion length, conductivity, corrosion resistance, and suitable band edges remains extremely challenging.30
To reduce the complexity and cost of industrial manufacture, a simple device design in which perovskite is directly applied on the electrode (either a transparent conductive oxide or metal electrode) would be an important development. Without any HTL layer, the PCEs typically achieved using Au/perovskite junctions are 10.49%13 and 10.85%,31 respectively. Li et al. have demonstrated an inverted ITO/perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag structure with a maximum PCE of 16%.32 Understanding the mechanism is important, as the PCEs of current inverted perovskite solar cells are not high. Recently, using non-solvent treatment, Ye et al. fabricated a p–i bulk junction MAPbI3−xClx, leaving CuI and Cu(thiourea)I as p-type semiconductors on an ITO substrate, with PCEs of 14.3% and 19.9%, respectively.33 They suggested that the dispersed copper-based p-type semiconductor acted as a trap state passivator (TSP) by aligning the VBM with that of the perovskite. Obviously, band alignment can influence the charge extraction, collection, and recombination kinetics, which, in turn, drastically affect the open circuit voltage (Voc), photocurrent density (Jsc), and fill factors (FFs). However, the exact action mechanism can be more complex than monotonic.
In our current work, instead of modifying peripheral layers, we adjusted the Fermi level of the perovskite through Cu doping and achieved a PCE of 15.14 ± 0.67% on ITO/Cu-perovskite/PCBM/Ag devices. In these devices, the Fermi level alignments rather than band edge alignments were used to elucidate the charge transfer/recombination at the ITO/perovskite junction. Unlike HTL optimization, we inspected the surface potential of the intrinsic and Cu-doped perovskite using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM).34 We found that the Fermi levels of the perovskite could be manipulated by Cu compensation dopants, and that various band bending structures were formed depending on the Fermi levels versus ITO. Furthermore, we used the transient surface photovoltage (TSPV) method,35,36 to determine that a faster charge collection was prominent due to higher band bending. Both charge collection and photovoltage must be balanced to obtain higher PCEs.
Results and discussion
Firstly, considering the heterojunction between ITO and organic metal halogen perovskite as an example, the band edge alignment was not validated for charge separation and recombination study. To our knowledge, ITO is a heavily doped n-type semiconductor (Sn doped In2O3) with a constant Fermi level close to the CBM that can be treated as a metal.37 Unlike many other studies on adjusting the VBM position relative to the perovskite, the reason for poor PCEs on pure HTL-free devices can be serious charge recombination due to the inappropriate band bending of perovskite at the interface. Fig. 1 shows three band-bending conditions of the ITO/perovskite junctions corresponding to the different Fermi levels of the perovskite. When the Fermi level of the perovskite is lower than that of ITO (ϕF,ITO > ϕF,perov in Fig. 1a) in the dark before contact, a depletion layer with downward band bending will form after the charge between ITO and the perovskite equilibrates (in Fig. 1b). With light illumination onto the semiconductor, the quasi-Fermi level of the electron  will split (Δϕ) due to charge being excited from the valence band to the conduction band. The backflow of electrons to the ITO/perovskite junction causes significant interface recombination and reduces Δϕ. Next, when the Fermi level of the perovskite is equal to that of ITO (ϕF,ITO = ϕF,perov in Fig. 1c), a flat band condition will be achieved without any band bending (Fig. 1d). If the Fermi level of the perovskite is higher than that of ITO (ϕF,ITO < ϕF,perov in Fig. 1e), an accumulation layer with upward band bending will be formed (Fig. 1f). Obviously, holes can be extracted to the interface due to the internal built-in field near the interface (Fig. 1d). Charge recombination can be significantly suppressed in this situation. Speculatively, the charge separation, transfer, and recombination kinetics will influence these HTL-free ITO/perovskite junctions.

Blue dashed lines correspond to the quasi-Fermi level of the electron. Δϕ is the potential difference between the quasi-Fermi levels of electron and holes. Rint is the charge recombination at the ITO/perovskite interface. 
With the aim to realize adjustable Fermi level alignments for high performance HTL-free solar cells, we initiated experiments by sputtering a thin elemental Cu layer (5–40 nm) onto ITO substrate, which was converted to a CuI layer (Fig. S1†) by room temperature iodination in a closed container for several minutes, according to a literature procedure.38 The key step in our design was the subsequent spin-coating of perovskite precursor onto ITO/CuI, which not only forms a perovskite thin film, but also introduces copper dopant into the film. The detailed procedures and description of Cu-free and Cu-doped perovskite films can be found in the Experimental section. In Fig. 2a, the Cu-free perovskite sample exhibits a smooth and conformal surface with large grain boundaries (∼550 nm). From the cross-section, the film was about 350 nm thick and no voids were observed. Meanwhile, the Cu20-perovskite films (in Fig. 2b) had comparable grain boundaries of about 400–500 nm. The cross-section image showed that the perovskite crystals were in direct contact with the ITO substrate, without a residual CuI interlayer. From the EDS mapping images (Fig. S2†), Cu was vertically distributed throughout the films, as for Pb and I (uniformity is confirmed by HRTEM in the next section). We also checked other perovskite films with different doping levels (Cu10, Cu30, Cu40-perovskite films, which are named based on the starting Cu film thickness 10 nm, 30 nm and 40 nm, in Fig. S3†), of which all Cu-perovskite films showed a high-quality conformal nature without any obvious pin-holes or interlayer.

In addition, all perovskite films on ITO in Fig. 2c displayed similar tetragonal perovskite diffraction patterns (I4/mcm). The peaks could be indexed as (110), (112), (022), (220), (130), (132), (400), and (330) diffractions, respectively, which agreed well with the literature.39,40 Notably, no peaks assigned to CuI, CuI2, or Cu impurities were present. After preparing the same perovskite on Si(200) substrate and using the Si(400) peak at 69.29° as reference, a slight right shift of the (400) and (330) peaks on the Cu incorporated films was found (Fig. 2d), indicating shrinkage of the perovskite lattice. Again, no peak near 42.3° for (220) of CuI was detected (JCPDS Card No. 75-0831). After calculation (Fig. S4 and Table S1†), lattice parameter a decreased linearly from 8.8760 Å (Cu-free perovskite) to 8.8682 Å (Cu40-perovskite) with a volume shrinkage of ∼0.182%.
Moreover, we performed XPS analysis of the perovskite film and CuI films in Fig. 2e and f. In the top panel of Fig. 2e, the peaks at 618.9 eV and 630.4 eV corresponded to the I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2 of the Cu20-perovskite film, respectively, which are close to the reported value for CH3NH3I41 and perovskite.42,43 These values were significantly lower than 619.5 eV and 631.0 eV for CuI (bottom line) and reported values,44 due to the possible change in chemical environment of iodine atoms from a tetragonal site in CuI to X sites in the ABX3 perovskite. Moreover, we found no peak splitting in the perovskite from CuI impurities. In Fig. 2f, we observed binding energies of 932.0 eV and 951.9 eV for the Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of perovskite (upper line), respectively, which were closer to the Cu(1+) state than the (2+) state. These values also showed small negative shifts compared with 932.3 eV and 952.05 eV for CuI (bottom line) and literature values,44 suggesting a possible bond length change between Cu and I in perovskite films. Additionally, there was no observable Cu2+ satellite feature at ∼943 eV, further evidencing the presence of monovalent Cu(1+) in the copper-doped perovskite.44 The XPS survey spectrum of Cu20-perovskite (Fig. S5a†) showed distinct peaks at 122.3 eV and 932 eV, corresponding to Cu 3s and Cu 2p3/2 (in red), respectively. As dissolution of CuI in DMF (or diluted perovskite solution) was much lower than in perovskite precursor solution, the ITO/Cu20-perovskite films were quickly washed with pure DMF three times and dried. The XPS survey trace in the bottom of Fig. S5a† confirmed the absence of I or Cu, suggesting that no CuI interlayer was present between ITO and perovskite after the DMF wash. Notably, integration was loosely based on the relatively slow dissolution rate of CuI compared to Cu-perovskite in pure DMF (or diluted perovskite DMF solution). The absence of CuI indicated that the obtained films did not have a CuI/perovskite layered structure or bulk junction structure.
According to the peak fitting results (Fig. 2e, f and S5†), the atomic ratio of Pb, N (or C), Cu, and I was calculated (Fig. S6†). The atomic ratio for Cu20-perovskite was approximately 1:0.5:0.09:2.6 for Pb/N/Cu/I (normalized versus Pb), which slightly deviated from the optimal ratio (1:0.91:0.09:3) due to possible sublimation under ultra-high vacuum conditions.45 The surface Cu/Pb ratio was higher than that given by ICP-OES (0.0125, 0.0234, and 0.0326 Cu mol% for Cu10, Cu20, and Cu30-perovskite, respectively), due to possible surface migration or chemical passivation.46 Moreover, the Raman spectra (in Fig. S7†) confirmed perovskite structures without any peaks from CuI or PbI2 impurities.47,48 Combining these SEM, XRD, and XPS results with the Goldschmidt tolerance factor7 and Born–Lande lattice energy estimation,49 Cu+ substitution was likely to occur at the CH3NH3+ site rather than the Pb2+ site in thin films at low concentration.
To further confirm the doping nature rather than a CuI/perovskite bulk junction, we used HRTEM to check whether CuI existed as small domains or an underlayer. To avoid Cu contamination from the TEM grid, we prepared the Cu-perovskite specimen on a carbon-coated Au grid according to the same procedure as that on ITO (Fig. 3a). From the HRTEM image (Fig. 3b), a two-dimensional lattice was clearly observed as a highly crystalline sample, with a lattice spacing of 3.17 Å indexed to the (20) plane of perovskite. From the inserted FFT image, the diffractions can be indexed as (20) and (004), which was in good agreement with the tetragonal phase along the [110] zone axis in the perovskite lattice.40 There were no secondary diffractions from any CuI underlayer shown in the FFT image. Checking numerous positions and sample grids showed that no CuI domains or underlayer were detected. STEM-EDS elemental mapping analysis (Fig. 3c) was also performed at the same position as for the HRTEM image in Fig. 3b, which confirmed the uniform distribution of Cu, I, and Pb (Fig. 3d–f) in the perovskite film. This demonstrated the single crystalline features of Cu-doped perovskite.

When Cu(1+) was incorporated into the perovskite lattice, it could be deionized by providing electrons to shift the Fermi level of the perovskites. Therefore, we used KPFM to scrutinize the energy levels of these films with a Pt/Ir tip (SCM-PIT probe) on a dimension icon platform in dark lift mode (Figs. S8 and S9†). The local contact potential difference (CPD) of thin films reflected the surface potential difference (similar to the Fermi level energy difference) between the tip and samples.50 In Fig. 4a and Table S2,† the Fermi level increased from −5.44 eV to −5.23, −5.09, −5.0, and −4.91 eV with increasing Cu amount. The Fermi level of the pure perovskite was lower than values reported from the two-step deposition method.46 This indicated that the intrinsic Cu-free perovskite prepared herein was a highly doped p-type semiconductor, with Cu acting as an electron donor species or compensating defects for a weak p-type nature. Obviously, this is differs greatly from the concept of using p-type CuI, CuSCN, or Cu(Tu)I as trap-state passivators, as reported by Ye.23,33

As speculated earlier, the charge separation and recombination kinetics can differ greatly due to the various band-bending structures. Using a pulsed laser (λ = 355 nm, 4 ns), TPSV spectra were used to analyze the ITO/perovskite junctions under ambient conditions. Both the TSPV curves of Cu-free ITO/perovskite and ITO/Cu20-perovskite were plotted in Fig. 4b, showing negative peaks of p-type semiconductors, which were attributed to negative charge collection/accumulation at the solid/air surface by downward band bending near the surface. The signal reached a sharp minimum in several microseconds, corresponding to charge separation at the ITO/perovskite junction, while the curves increased exponentially back to zero, corresponding to charge recombination at the perovskite/air junction. Surprisingly, we noted a positive spark in the first 1–3 μs on the Cu-free perovskite samples (dashed circle in Fig. 4c), implying a reverse charge-separation/accumulation in this time scale (with band structures in Fig. 1a and b) similar to those previously found at an FTO/hematite interface.36 For the ITO/Cu20-perovskite junction, this voltage spark had disappeared (red line in Fig. 4c), suggesting better charge separation. We found only a smaller broad positive peak for the ITO/Cu10-perovskite sample (black circle in Fig. S10a†). This result confirmed that the positive sparks are eliminated after Cu is incorporated, suppressing reverse charge accumulation/recombination at the ITO/perovskite junction.
Due to the capacitor nature of the TSPV apparatus, the TSPV signal can be simulated using eqn (1) according to the first-order kinetics and series processes (simulation details can be found in the ESI†):51 (1)where ksep and krec are the rate constants for charge separation and recombination, respectively; Qexc,0 is the initial charge excited by the laser pulse in the bulk semiconductor and C is the TSPV capacitance. As shown in Table S3,† the recombination rate constant, krec, was 1.22 × 103 s−1 for Cu-free perovskite, which increased to 2.52 × 103 s−1, 2.95 × 103 s−1, 3.60 × 103 s−1, and 3.52 × 103 s−1 for Cu10, Cu20, Cu30, and Cu40-perovskite, respectively. We found that Cu caused the recombination rate constants and initial excited charge to increase consequently. Notably, this result was not contrary to those of Abdi-Jalebi46 or Ye,23 because interface charge recombination passivation was also related to separation competition.52 We found that the charge separation rate constant, ksep, was 5.42 × 104 s−1 for the Cu-free ITO/perovskite junction, and increased to 5.42 × 104 s−1, 1.24 × 105 s−1, 1.80 × 105 s−1, 2.15 × 105 s−1, and 4.11 × 105 s−1 for Cu10, Cu20, Cu30, and Cu40-perovskite junctions on ITO, respectively. The simulated curves were almost identical to the experimental results in Fig. 4d and S10, strongly confirming the validation of the hypothesis of first-order and series kinetics of charge separation and recombination on ITO/perovskite heterojunctions and air surface.
To verify the hypothesis of better charge separation at the ITO/Cu-perovskite interface, we used photoluminescence (PL) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The PL intensity significantly decreased on the Cu-doped perovskite film (Fig. S11a†), especially on the ITO substrate (Fig. S11b†). This PL quenching suggested better charge separation at the ITO interface, which caused a PL decrease in perovskite.16 In Fig. S11c,† using a double exponential fitting, a shorter PL lifetime (τ1 ∼ 389 ns) was observed on the ITO/Cu20-perovskite interface than that on the undoped sample (588 ns), due to more efficient charge separation.16,53 Additionally, the EIS results showed a smaller semicircle on the ITO/Cu20-perovskite sample than on the undoped sample (Fig. S12†), which further confirmed the smaller charge transfer resistance and better charge separation at the interface.21,53,54
As the TSPV signal is intrinsically due to the amount of the separated charge at each side of the semiconductor, we selected in situ photoconductive AFM to investigate the nanoelectric properties on ITO/Cu-perovskite junction before device assembly. In Fig. 5, pc-AFM on the ITO/perovskite and ITO/Cu20-perovskite was performed in conductive AFM mode using a PFTUNA probe (Pt/Ir tip) under one-sun light. Both the Cu-free and Cu-doped perovskite films were conformed on the substrate with low roughness, as shown in Fig. 5a and d. In Fig. 5b, the bright and dark regions on each perovskite crystal corresponded to current variation at the grain boundaries.55 The inset shows a linear scan curve of the photocurrent density (in the range 0–0.6 nA) under light. While for single position ramping, the typical J–V photovoltaic behaviour in Fig. 5c showed that the Voc was about 0.55 V and the Jsc was about 46 pA. For the Cu-doped perovskite (Fig. 5e), the photocurrent had increased about four-fold in the range 0–3 nA. In Fig. 5f, the single position ramping J–V curve showed increases in Voc, to 0.73 V, and Jsc, to 190 pA. Under dark conditions, the current density was negligible (Fig. S13†). These pc-AFM results clearly showed that both charge collection and open circuit potential (photovoltage) could be improved after Cu doping, in good agreement with previous speculation, as shown in Fig. 1.

Encouraged by the efficient charge separation and higher photovoltage at the ITO/Cu-perovskite heterojunction, we then fabricated inverted ITO/perovskite/PCBM/Ag solar cells (PCBM as ETL), as shown in Fig. 6a. In Fig. 6b, the controlled devices with pristine Cu-free perovskite (using ITO as substrate) only exhibited a PCE of 6.46%, with a Jsc of 16.59 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.875 V, and fill factor (FF) of 44.54%. Meanwhile, the Cu-perovskite cells showed significant PCE improvements. For example, the Voc of the Cu-perovskite solar cells increased from 0.956 V to 1.038 V for Cu10 and Cu20, and decreased to 1.034 V and 0.848 V for Cu30 and Cu40, respectively. The Jsc increased from 21.65 mA cm−2 to 22.73 mA cm−2, 22.67 mA cm−2, and 20.31 mA cm−2 for Cu10 to Cu40, respectively. The corresponding FF increased from 56.81% to 65.44%, 62.02%, and 63.58%. As a result, the PCEs increased to 11.76%, 15.23%, 14.54%, and 10.95%. Additionally, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the Cu20-perovskite device was shown in Fig. 6c. The spectrum showed a high plateau (95–76%) over almost the entire visible light range (400–800 nm), which was similar to the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. S14†), indicating a high conversion ratio of incident photons to extracted current. The cut-off wavelength of 802 nm corresponded to the perovskite band edge (Eg = 1.54 eV). The integrated current density (∼21.2 mA cm−2) of the Cu20-perovskite device at all wavelengths from IPCE was in good agreement with the Jsc. Regarding the device stability, an electric fan was easily powered by five unencapsulated devices in series (Movies in ESI and Fig. S15†). The average PCEs based on eight parallel devices for each doping condition are listed in Fig. 6d and Table S4.† Additionally, the standard PCE deviation of the inverted perovskite devices ranged from 0.45% to 0.79% with slight hysteresis between the forward and reverse scan (Fig. S16†). With this, it was found that the Cu20-perovskite device showed highest PCEs of 15.14 ± 0.67% (with a highest PCE value of 15.84%) with good reproducibility.

It was noted that the PCEs of the ITO/perovskite heterojunctions not only depended on the charge separation kinetics, but also the photovoltage (or Voc). On the ITO/Cu30-perovskite and ITO/Cu40-perovskite junctions, large upward band bending of perovskite was expected, which demonstrates faster charge-separation/extraction kinetics than on the ITO/Cu20-perovskite junction. However, the photovoltage generated on perovskite with large amounts of Cu (Cu30 and Cu40 perovskite) decreased as the Fermi level increased. This agreed well with the smaller Voc of the devices and the speculation in Fig. 1f. Manipulating the band structures with Fermi levels and band edges significantly determined by charge separation and recombination kinetics using a different mechanism requires further research. For instance, a common method for spin-coating a single CuI-perovskite precursor solution directly on ITO substrate is of high importance to further reduce the complexity and device cost, although the current highest PCE of 14.3% was slightly lower than previously reported PCEs.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully manipulated the band structures of halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 using in situ copper doping with spin coating processes on an ITO/CuI substrate, which showed a high PCE of 15.84% for inverted HTL-free perovskite solar cells. This represents the first report of Cu dopant controlling the adjustment of a perovskite band structure accommodated in an ITO electrode, which enabled high charge separation and hole collection at the ITO side for an inverted perovskite device. This understanding of the Fermi level alignment and band-bending-related thermodynamics and kinetics will benefit many heterojunction solar cell devices.
Experimental
Materials
All chemicals were commercially available, stored under Ar in a glovebox, and used without further purification: CH3NH3I (MAI, Xi'an polymer, 99.5%), lead acetate trihydrate (Aladdin, 99.998%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Alfa Aesar, 99.8%), chlorobenzene (Aladdin, 99.5%), [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, Nichem, 99%), Cu wire (KYD materials, 99.99%), and iodine (Alfa Aesar, 99%). Processes for precursor weighing, solution preparation, spin-coating, and device fabrication were performed in an Ar-filled glove box (<0.5 ppm O2 and <0.5 ppm H2O).

In situ preparation of ITO/CuI substrates
The ITO glasses (10 Ω per square, South China Sci. & Tech. Com. Ltd.) were etched over 1/3 of the area using a laser, avoiding short circuiting the devices. All ITO substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, ultra-pure water, acetone, and ethanol sequentially. After blow-drying with nitrogen, the ITO substrate was treated with UV-O3 (PSD UV cleaner, Novascan) for 5–15 min. Cu metal films were then deposited on ITO with controlled thicknesses of 10 nm, 20 nm, 30 nm and 40 nm by evaporating Cu wire in a K950X Turbo evaporator (Quorum Tech). Next, CuI films were in situ generated by direct reaction of the Cu films and iodine vapour (>0.305 mm Hg) for about 1.5–10 min in closed containers containing I2 flakes at the bottom.
Spin-coating for Cu-doped perovskite films
Perovskite precursor stock solution was prepared by dissolving 3 mmol MAI and 1 mmol lead acetate trihydrate in 1 mL DMF and storing in refrigerator at 4 °C for 3–4 days. This solution was then spin-coated on fresh ITO/CuI substrates at 3000 rpm for 60 s. Black-brown perovskite films were obtained after annealing at 125 °C on a hot plate for 5 min. Undoped Cu-free perovskite films were prepared directly on ITO substrate using the same process as for the control samples. The doped perovskite films were named Cu10-, Cu20-, Cu30-, and Cu40-perovskite according to their respective Cu film thicknesses. Film reproductivity was highly sensitive to the temperature uniformity and thermal conductivity of the hotplate (Fig. S17†), so an additional Al plate was added to the ceramic surface (IKA C-MAG HS 7). Cu-perovskite specimens for TEM observation were prepared on Au grids supported with carbon films (eliminating Cu contamination from the grid) according to the same procedure, except using the dip-coating process.
Inverted HTL-free perovskite solar cell devices
PCBM solution in chlorobenzene (20 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the perovskite films at 3000 rpm for 45 s, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C. Next, an Ag electrode was evaporated on them with an aperture mask (about 0.11 cm2). The unsealed ITO/(CH3NH3)1−xCuxPbI3/PCBM/Ag planar devices were then used for analysis.
Characterization
The survey and cross-section of the perovskite films were collected using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, FEI Nova 450) and elemental mapping images were recorded using a Zeiss SEM (Zeiss Sigma 500) equipped with two SDD EDS detectors (Oxford, X-Max 150). XRD patterns were obtained on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance) using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation with a scanning step of 0.005°. TEM observations were carried out on a transmission electron microscope (JEOL, JEM-2100F) operating at 200 kV equipped with an SDD EDS detector (Oxford, X-Max 80T). XPS analysis was carried out on Thermo Escalab 250Xi spectrometer (Thermofisher) excited with monochromatic Al Kα radiation. Raman spectra were recorded using a spectrometer (Renishaw in Via) excited with a 532 nm laser. The elemental composition of perovskite films was dissolved in HNO3 solution and analyzed using an ICP-OES Spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Optima 8000).
Photovoltaic performance of Cu-doped perovskite films

J–V curves of the perovskite solar cell devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under ambient conditions (40 RH%), while the devices were illuminated under simulated solar light (Newport 91192STS simulator equipped with AM 1.5 G filter, calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a standard silicon reference meter 91150V). The IPCE spectra were recorded on a commercial IPCE measurement system (Newport 66902 Arc lamp, 70356 Si detector and 74004 motorized monochromator).
Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements and photoconductive AFM (pc-AFM)
The work function and contact potential difference (CPD) of the materials was evaluated using an atomic force microscope (Dimension Icon, Bruker, Germany) using an AM-KPFM technique under ambient conditions. The SCM-PIT (Bruker) probe was covered with Pt/Ir at the tip. Each of the glass/perovskite samples was transferred from the glove box and immediately measured in 10 min. The surface potentials (or Fermi level) were recorded with a dark-lift of 100 nm. For pc-AFM analysis, conductive AFM mode was applied to the ITO/perovskite films and PFTUNA probes (Pt/Ir tip) were used. The dark currents and photocurrents were collected in the same region, where white light (Newport 66984) guided from a fiber was used from the ITO bottom (∼1.01 sun).
Transient measurements
For transient surface photovoltage measurements, the ITO/perovskite and ITO/Cu-perovskite samples were excited using a Nd:YAG pulse laser (355 nm and 4 ns, Quantel Brilliant Eazy, BRILEZ/IR-10) and the potentials were recorded by a digital TDS oscilloscope (500 MHz, TDS 3054C, Tektronix). The test sample configuration for TSPV was like a flat-plate capacitor consisting of ITO/(CH3NH3)1−xCuxPbIs, mica-flake, and ITO, sequentially. The voltage was measured on the two ITO electrodes. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded on time-resolved FLS 980 (Edinburgh Instruments) and a F-4600 FL (Hitachi) spectrometers for transient and steady state measurements, with the exciton wavelength set at 660 nm and emission wavelength at 775 nm. Electrochemical impedance spectra of the ITO/Cu-perovskite junction (Au as counter electrode) were recorded on a potentiostat (CH Instrument 660E, Shanghai) at 0 V in the dark and AM 1.5 illumination (1 sun) conditions.
