    , Accepted 13th December 2017First published on 13th December 2017AbstractA bifunctional cobalt phosphide (CoP) electrocatalyst is applied to a doubly promoted BiVO4 photoanode as an oxygen evolution as well as to a cathode as a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst to establish a photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting cell made of only earth abundant elements without any precious metals. Although the intrinsic HER activity of CoP is lower than Pt/C, CoP can replace Pt as the cathode of PEC water splitting cells without any significant loss in performance. During the water splitting reaction, the cathode remains as CoP, but CoP loaded on the BiVO4 photoanode turns into amorphous CoOx–HPOy with its chemical state and performance very similar to those of well-known cobalt phosphate electrocatalysts. A tandem cell composed of CoP/hydrogen-treated, 1% Mo-doped BiVO4 as the photoanode, a CoP/Ni foam as the cathode and a 2-piece, series connected crystalline Si solar cell as the bias power generator demonstrates stable unassisted water splitting with a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 5.3% under simulated solar light, which represents the highest among reported precious metal-free unassisted solar water splitting devices.
Introduction
Solar water splitting (2H2O → 2H2 + O2, ΔG° = 238 kJ mol−1) has been considered as an ideal route to sustainable hydrogen production from the most abundant renewable energy (sun) and the most abundant natural resource (water) available on earth.1–4 Three technical options are available to produce solar hydrogen from water splitting: photovoltaics (PV) followed by water electrolyzer, photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell and particulate photocatalysis. These technologies have their advantages and drawbacks, but eventually solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency, durability for extended operation and overall economic competitiveness will determine the technology of choice.
In order to minimize the cost of hydrogen production, systems have to be made of readily available earth-abundant elements.5 However, electrolyzers and PEC cells employ electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water, and rare and expensive IrO2 and Pt are the most efficient and commonly used OER and HER electrocatalysts, respectively. Particulate photocatalysts also employ precious metal co-catalysts like Pt, IrO2, and RuO2 deposited on semiconductor photocatalyst particles to promote H2 and O2 evolution reactions. Hence, extensive research studies have been focused on the replacement of these precious metals with less expensive but still highly efficient electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant elements.6 Many transition metal carbides, nitrides, sulfides, and phosphides have been studied lately as low-cost, non-precious metal electrocatalysts especially for the HER.
Recently, bifunctional7 electrocatalysis has attracted attention, in which a single catalyst material promotes both the HER and the OER of water splitting in the same electrolyte.8,9 Such bifunctionality could provide multiple practical advantages such as scalability, low catalyst preparation cost and system versatility, which will eventually lower the cost of the total system. The reported precious metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts include metal phosphides (CoP, Co2P, Ni2P, and CoFeP alloys),7,10 sulfides (Ni3S2),11 nitrides (Ni3FeN),12 selenides (CoSe2 and NiSe2),13 borides (Co–B)14,15 and their derivatives. In particular, CoP and its derivatives have attracted significant interest recently as a bifunctional catalyst showing a modest HER activity as well as an excellent OER activity comparable to the best known non-noble metal OER catalysts in a wide range of pH.16
In the present work, we apply CoP as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the OER and the HER in order to demonstrate a complete precious metal-free solar water splitting tandem cell composed of CoP/hydrogen-treated, 1% Mo-doped BiVO4 as the photoanode, a CoP/Ni foam as the cathode and a 2-piece, series connected crystalline Si solar cell as the bias power generator for unassisted solar water splitting. Previous studies on bifunctional water splitting catalysts were carried out under electrochemical conditions, and our work represents the first study on a bifunctional OER catalyst deposited on a semiconductor photoanode under PEC conditions. It was convincingly demonstrated that CoP loaded on Ni foam could be used instead of expensive Pt as the HER electrocatalyst without significant loss in performance by showing that a PEC water splitting cell with the CoP cathode exhibited a performance similar to that with a Pt cathode. Thus, our precious metal-free tandem cell with a bifunctional CoP electrocatalyst promoting both the OER and the HER recorded the highest solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency (5.3%) among reported precious metal-free unbiased PEC cells.17
Experimental
Preparation of BiVO4 films
All chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and used without further purification. BiVO4 films were prepared by a modified metal–organic decomposition (MOD) method with a slight modification of our previous procedure.18–20 Thus, 0.2 M Bi(NO3)·5H2O (99.8%; Kanto Chemicals) dissolved in acetic acid (99.7%; Kanto Chemicals), 0.03 M VO(acac)2 (98.0%; Sigma Aldrich) and 0.03 M MoO2(acac)2 (98.0%; Sigma Aldrich) in acetyl acetone (>99.0%; Kanto Chemicals) were prepared as a precursor solution. Then a stoichiometric amount of each precursor was mixed to complete a precursor solution. For Mo doping, a Bi:(V + Mo) = 1:1 atomic ratio was applied for 1% Mo:BiVO4 films. For the fabrication of a BiVO4 film, 60 μl of solution was dropped on a FTO glass (2 cm × 2.5 cm) and dried for 15 min in an Ar atmosphere. The FTO glass (TEC 8; Pilkington) was cleaned by using KOH (0.1 M) + ethanol with a ratio of 1:5, and washed with a copious amount of deionized water and finally stored in acetone until use. The greenish transparent precursor film was calcined at 550 °C for 25 min to form a yellow BiVO4 film. After the annealing process, 2 cm × 2.5 cm BiVO4/FTO was split to obtain photoanodes and connected with silver paste and copper wire and sealed with epoxy resin.
Reduction treatment of metal oxide films
Reduction treatment via decomposition of borohydride was conducted using a method reported by Hao et al.21 First, 16 mmol of NaBH4 (>98%; Sigma Aldrich) was put in a 200 ml alumina crucible and another smaller alumina bottle (15 ml) was put on the NaBH4 powder. In this smaller bottle, the as-prepared metal oxide film (2 cm × 2.5 cm) was placed and finally the 200 ml alumina crucible was covered with an alumina cover. This reactor was put in an already-heated furnace at 500 °C for 30 min. Then the crucible was immediately taken out from the furnace and cooled down naturally.
Fabrication of a BiVO4 – c-Si tandem cell
A tandem cell was made with a c-Si solar cell, following a similar protocol used in our previous work with a BiVO4 photoanode and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell.20 A piece of the c-Si solar cell was cut into small pieces to make series connection (denoted as 2 piece, series connected crystalline silicon solar cell, or 2 ps c-Si). Then, two pieces of c-Si were filed up on the Al side (hole transfer side) and ITO (electron transfer side) with Ag paste. The area of the two pieces became 0.30–0.32 cm2. And BiVO4 films were attached sequentially with glue with the c-Si solar cell at the bottom and they were electrically attached with Ag paste and a copper sheet to the backside of the 2 ps c-Si solar cell (Al side, hole transfer side). Finally, the exposed ITO side of the bottom 2 ps c-Si solar cell was connected to copper wire and all possible electrical connections were covered with epoxy (Locktit, cured at room temperature, 1 h) for isolation.
Characterization of the BiVO4 photoanode
XRD measurements were carried out with an X-ray diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu Kα (λ = 1.54178 Å) radiation from a rotating anode source (X'Pert PRO MPD, PANalytical, 30 mA, 40 kV). UV-Vis absorbance was measured with a UV/Vis spectrometer (UV-2401PC, Shimadzu). As a reference, BaSO4 powder attached on FTO was used. The morphology of the samples was observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL JMS-7400F, operated at 10 keV), and the composition was examined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The chemical state of BiVO4 and other films was probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with an ESCALAB 250 Xi spectrometer. The detailed microscopic structure and the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) data were obtained using a Cs-corrected high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscope (HR-[S]TEM, JEOL, JEM 2200FS, 200 kV).
Measurements of photoelectrochemical performance
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements of the photoelectrodes were performed with a standard three-electrode configuration: photoanode as the working electrode, Pt mesh as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) as the reference electrode. The scan rate for the current–voltage (J–V) curve was 20 mV s−1. For water oxidation experiments, 0.5 M potassium phosphate (K2HPO4) buffer (pH ∼ 7.0) was used. To measure the degree of charge separation, 1.0 M Na2SO3 (>98%, Sigma Aldrich) was added to the pH 7, 0.5 M phosphate buffer electrolyte. Potentials were recorded with correction by using the Nernst relationship ERHE = ESCE + 0.0591pH + 0.209, in which EAg/AgCl is the applied bias potential and 0.209 is a conversion factor from the Ag/AgCl electrode to the RHE scale. All electrochemical data were recorded by using a potentiostat (IviumStat, Ivium Technologies). A 300 W xenon lamp was used to afford simulated 1 sun light irradiation conditions (100 mW cm−2) by using a solar simulator (Oriel 91160) with an AM 1.5G filter calibrated with a reference cell certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratories, USA.
The Mott–Schottky plot was used to determine electrochemical properties using the equation  where C = capacitance of the photoanode (metal oxide + electrolyte double layer, etc.), e = charge of the electron (C), ε = dielectric constant of BiVO4 and Fe2O3, εo = permittivity of vacuum, V = applied bias (vs. the RHE), Vf = flat band potential (vs. the RHE), k = Boltzmann constant, ND = donor density for the n-type semiconductor (cm−3), A = surface area of the photoanode (cm2) and T = temperature (K). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted with the same configuration of PEC measurements at 0.63 V vs. Ag/AgCl (1.23 VRHE) in an AC frequency range from 10−1 to 104 Hz under AM 1.5G irradiation. The spectra were analyzed by using the Z-View program (Scribner Associates Inc.) by using a Randles circuit as the equivalent circuit.
Photoelectrochemical H2 and O2 evolution measurements
Using Ar as a carrier gas, H2 and O2 gases evolved from the PEC cell were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (HP5890, molecular sieve 5 L column) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The light source and electrolyte were the same as those used for above PEC measurements, and the gas products were sampled every 20 min.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and electrochemical HER activity of CoP nanoparticles
The synthesis of cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoparticles used in this work starts with the reduction of CoCl2 in a NaBH4 solution, and the reduced cobalt particles react with phosphine gas produced from the decomposition of NaH2PO2 at 150 °C to form CoP nanoparticles.22,23 The XRD analysis in Fig. S1 of the ESI† shows that the reduced Co precursor of a low crystallinity turns eventually into crystalline CoP particles (JCPDS no. 00-029-0497) upon phosphidation. The synthesized CoP nanoparticles are around 20 nm in diameter and covered with native surface oxide as observed by SEM, TEM and XPS analyses in Fig. S2 and S3 of the ESI.† A lattice fringe spacing of 0.283 nm in Fig. S3b† corresponds to the (011) plane of orthorhombic CoP. The XPS spectra of Co 2p in Fig. S3c† show peaks at 778.5 eV and 793.9 eV due to Co3+ in CoP, and peaks at 781.8 eV and 798.0 eV assigned to Co2+ in CoO.24 Fig. S3d† shows two main XPS peaks of P 2p assigned to phosphide (129.3 eV) and phosphate (133.4 eV). The phosphide peak consists of two peaks due to Co–P (129.0 eV) and P–P (130.0 eV) bonds. The XPS reveals that our CoP nanoparticles contain cobalt oxide and phosphate on the surface even before any reaction as previously reported for CoP-derived electrocatalysts.22,24
The electrochemical HER activity of the CoP nanoparticles was studied on a glassy carbon electrode by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in acidic (1.0 M H2SO4), neutral (1.0 M KPi) and basic (1.0 M NaOH) electrolytes, and their polarization curves and Tafel plots (insets) are shown in Fig. 1. The catalysts show stable HER activities in all electrolytes. Although the HER performance of CoP is much lower than that of Pt/C, the standard and most active HER catalyst, it is noteworthy that it shows a good performance in a wide range of pH. There are only a few nonprecious metal electrocatalysts that are stable in acidic electrolytes. The reactivity in the neutral solution is of our concern here because, as a cathode of the PEC water splitting cell, it will be paired with a BiVO4 photoanode, which exhibits its best activity and stability in a neutral electrolyte. The performance is also comparable with those of other bare CoP electrocatalysts reported in the literature.23–28

CoP as an OER electrocatalyst on a BiVO4 photoanode
The OER activity of CoP has been reported more recently than its HER activity.14,16,18,19 We can confirm the bifunctionality of CoP by observing that CoP loaded on FTO shows both OER and HER activity in 0.5 M KPi (pH 7.0) in Fig. S4 of the ESI.† Notably, the sum of overpotentials for overall water splitting (OER and HER) was only 408 mV, indicating a high efficiency of the bifunctional electrocatalyst. In order to apply CoP as an OER catalyst for PEC water oxidation, CoP nanoparticles were loaded onto a BiVO4-based photoanode by drop casting (picture images in Fig. S5†). The synthesis, optimization and performance of bare BiVO4, Mo-doped BiVO4 (1% Mo:BiVO4), and hydrogen-treated Mo:BiVO4 (H, 1% Mo:BiVO4) were reported in detail in our recent publication.29 Now, the suspension of CoP nanoparticles (20 mg/2 ml ethanol) was dropped on the prepared 1% Mo:BiVO4 photoelectrode.
The performance of the CoP/1% Mo:BiVO4 photoanode is compared with other known high-efficiency electrocatalysts loaded on the same 1% Mo:BiVO4 photoanode in a typical three electrode PEC cell with a Pt rod as the counter electrode under 1 sun irradiation (100 mW cm−2) in 0.5 M KPi (pH 7.0) electrolyte. In Fig. 2a and S6,† CoP on Mo:BiVO4 shows a modest PEC water oxidation performance (2.7–3.0 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE) comparable with that of cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi, 3.0 mA cm−2), but significantly higher than those of FeOOH (2.2 mA cm−2), CoOx (1.0 mA cm−2), and IrOx (0.45 mA cm−2). The photocurrent generation reflects the relative capability of the hole injection into the OER of water because the same light absorber Mo:BiVO4 is used. Indeed, it is consistent with the surface charge separation efficiencies (ηsurf) in Fig. 2b, S6 and S7† determined from relative photocurrents generated from photo-oxidations of water and the hole scavenger (SO32−) as shown in Fig. S7 (procedure in the Experimental section of the ESI†). The ηsurf values represent the intrinsic capability of the OER electrocatalysts during the PEC water oxidation. Thus, CoP loading brings nearly complete (∼90%) injection of holes arriving at the surface of the photoanode from its bulk into the water oxidation reaction avoiding loss by recombination with electrons. This value is comparable to those of the best electrocatalysts applied for BiVO4 including Co-Pi.

(f) Chronoamperometry of the photoanodes (applied bias: 1.0 VRHE). Measurement conditions: AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2), electrolyte = 0.5 M KPi (pH 7.0), and cathode = Pt rod. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted at 1.23 VRHE. The Nyquist plots against a Randles circuit model in Fig. 2c and S6† show lowered RCT (impedance at semiconductor||electrolyte) by electrocatalysts – Co-Pi (1545 Ω), FeOOH (1801 Ω), CoP (2212 Ω), CoOx (3530 Ω), and IrOx (4008 Ω) from that of bare 1% Mo:BiVO4 (7851 Ω), indicating improved hole transfer dynamics by applying the electrocatalysts.
Open circuit potential (OCP) decay when light is turned off is larger for CoP or Co-Pi loaded 1% Mo:BiVO4 than for the bare one as shown in Fig. 2d and e, indicating a faster migration of charges on the surface.30 Co-catalyst-loaded photoanodes also show much larger OCP plateaus: CoP (∼650 mV), Co-Pi (∼800 mV), and bare 1% Mo:BiVO4 (∼25 mV). This roughly reflects cathodic onset shifts in the IV curves and thus enhanced photovoltage is indicative of an effective electrocatalyst.30 The photovoltage (Vph) arises from the difference between the Fermi level of the n-type semiconductor (Ef,n) and the pseudo Fermi level for holes under illumination (Ef,h). Thus increased Vph represents increased minority carrier density at the surface of the photoanode, or increased states of the pseudo Fermi level for holes (Efh) over the valence band.31 Therefore, we have to consider that CoP or Co-Pi “passivates” the surface of BiVO4 in addition to enhancing water oxidation kinetics as a catalyst as will be discussed later in detail.32,33 Both CoP and Co-Pi catalysts demonstrate a fairly good stability in a 4 h stability test as shown in Fig. 2f.
Active working phase of CoP loaded on a BiVO4 photoanode
The very similar behaviour of CoP and Co-Pi in general in photooxidation of water as shown in Fig. 2 led us to the investigation of the active catalytic phase of CoP under working conditions by examining CoP/1% Mo:BiVO4 after 30 min of continuous PEC operation at 1.0 VRHE. The XRD analysis did not provide any information on CoP as shown in Fig. S8† because of its small loading. Useful information was obtained from XPS analysis in Fig. S9.† Fresh CoP/1% Mo:BiVO4 shows a large amount of native oxide on the CoP surface as in the as-synthesized CoP nanoparticles. After PEC water oxidation, phosphate peak intensity (P–O, 133.4 eV) increased greatly. The state of surface oxygen was also shifted slightly by showing more –OH peak intensity (531.3 eV) than metal oxide peak intensity (M–O, 529.7 eV), suggesting the formation of more hydroxyl groups after the reaction. Thus this indicates that native oxide on CoP is converted to a cobalt hydroxyphosphate compound (CoOx–HPOy) under the oxidative PEC reaction conditions on the photoanode. This is the same phase that is known to be formed with Co-Pi during PEC water oxidation in a biphosphate electrolyte.23,24,27,28,34 The presence of HPO42− in the electrolyte is essential for the formation of the active phase and the high promotional effect of CoP. Thus, CoP/1% Mo:BiVO4 in a different electrolyte 0.5 M KHCO3 (pH ∼ 6.8 by CO2 purging) showed nearly no promotional effect of the CoP OER catalyst compared to bare 1% Mo:BiVO4 (Fig. S10†). In a similar manner, self-regeneration of Co-Pi in the biphosphate electrolyte has been well established, which is related to the intermediate biphosphate cycling during water oxidation.35
The morphology of CoP/1% Mo:BiVO4 was examined by SEM and TEM before and after the PEC water oxidation. As shown in Fig. 3 and S11,† large agglomerates of CoP particles on the Mo:BiVO4 surface are seen before the PEC reaction, but most of them disappear and many small particles become well dispersed on the BiVO4 surface forming a thin overlayer during the reaction. The TEM images indicate that the crystalline CoP agglomerates covering the BiVO4 surface turn into a thin layer of amorphous CoOx–HPOy phase. The coverage of the BiVO4 surface by the CoOx–HPOy layer may be responsible for the passivation of the surface states on BiVO4 as revealed by the OCP decay analysis. Fig. 3e depicts a scheme of the in situ development of the water oxidation active phase of CoP (amorphous CoOx·HPO4) during the PEC reaction in KPi electrolyte on a BiVO4 photoanode. In contrast, loading CoP or CoO particles oxidized at 573 K in air did not bring significant electrocatalytic effects (Fig. S12†). This suggests that the oxidation of CoP particles by holes generated in BiVO4 in KPi during the PEC water oxidation is the main mechanism for the activation of CoP.

(e) Scheme of the in situ development of the water oxidation active phase of CoP (amorphous CoOx·HPO4) during PEC water oxidation on a BiVO4 photoanode. SEM scale bar: 100 nm and TEM scale bar: 2.0 nm. 
Optimization was conducted for the amount of CoP or CoPi loading on Mo:BiVO4 (Fig. S13†). CoP does not show any dependence on the amount of loading because only CoP particles that come into contact with the Mo:BiVO4 surface get activated and other particles stay away from the Mo:BiVO4 surface. In contrast, Co-Pi loading regulated by bias potentials of photoelectric deposition should be conducted with optimum deposition condition (−0.2 VAg/AgCl) because they are rather conformally loaded and can be “overloaded” on top of the already deposited Co-Pi layer. Such a thick Co-Pi layer (−0.1 VAg/AgCl) takes holes but does not release them well giving a large transient current (Fig. S13d†). This simpler optimization process makes CoP loading operation easier.
Hole transfer kinetics was further studied by Potentio Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (PEIS) at varying biases to identify the roles of CoP or Co-Pi on BiVO4 as shown in Fig. 4 and S14.† The extracted capacitance of the surface state (Css) and impedance at the semiconductor||electrolyte interface (RCT) can elucidate how the photoelectrode surface interacts with the electrolyte, i.e., water oxidation kinetics. Surface modifications by CoP or Co-Pi greatly shift the potential needed for the maximum Css value toward the Fermi level of BiVO4 (bare: 1.0 VRHE, CoP: ∼0.3 VRHE, and Co-Pi: ∼0.3 VRHE) and increase maximum Css by a factor of 5–10. The OER catalysts also reduce the minimum RCT for hole transfer. The cathodic shift of potential giving maximum Css indicates that surface states are depleted and hole transfer towards the water oxidation reaction occurs at a much lower bias.31 As noted from Fig. 2, larger photovoltages achieved by CoP and Co-Pi loading suggest that they are likely to cover defect sites and thereby increase the built-in-potential leading to a much “earlier” yield of holes from the capacitive surface of BiVO4.26,27 Also an increase in maximum Css by CoP or Co-Pi indicates an increased concentration of water oxidation intermediates or hole storage capability of the photoanode, thus preventing holes from recombination at the surface of BiVO4.31 The similar capacitance and impedance behaviours of CoP and Co-Pi are consistent with the observed transformation of CoP loaded on BiVO4 into CoOx–HPOy just like Co-Pi. They form an “adaptive junction”33,36 that covers the surface defects of BiVO4 (ref. 27 and 30) and transfers holes through an alternative pathway via hole storage allowing better water oxidation kinetics than bare BiVO4. This discussion on the role of the OER catalyst is illustrated in Fig. 4b.

Precious metal-free PEC water splitting cell with the bi-functional CoP electrocatalyst
In order to establish a precious metal-free PEC water splitting cell with the bi-functional CoP electrocatalyst, CoP nanoparticles were loaded onto a BiVO4-based photoanode and a Ni foam cathode by drop casting of CoP suspensions. The Ni foam was obtained from Sigma Aldrich (300 × 300 × 1.6 mm, 95% porosity) and used after dipping in 1 M HCl and washing with water. Fig. 5a and S5† illustrate the whole procedure. Fig. 5b shows that CoP loading on 1% Mo:BiVO4 increases the photocurrent by 30 fold (0.1 mA cm−2 → 3.0 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE). The CoP loading also shifts the onset potential from 0.6 VRHE to 0.3 VRHE, which is similar to those of reported efficient electrocatalysts loaded on BiVO4 in near-neutral (pH 7.0–9.0) electrolytes such as Co/Ni–Ci and Co-Pi,20,37,38 NiOOH/FeOOH,39,40 FeOOH,41 and NiOx/CoOx.30 The Ni foam has a significant HER activity of its own, but CoP loading brings a remarkable HER performance enhancement by shifting the onset potential by ∼0.04 V and achieving high current densities from −3.0 mA cm−2 for bare Ni foam to −6.0 mA cm−2 for CoP/Ni foam at −0.2 VRHE. This value is high enough to match water oxidation photocurrents generated at the photoanode. Short term stability and gas evolution tests were conducted with an applied bias of 1.0 VRHE. Stable photocurrents and gas evolution are observed as shown in Fig. 5c that exhibits a faradaic efficiency of ∼95% for both H2 and O2 evolution. Therefore, CoP loading on both electrodes enables efficient and stable overall water splitting in a neutral electrolyte. Especially, vigorous gas evolution on the surface of CoP/Mo:BiVO4 was visually observed as shown in Fig. S5 of the ESI.† In order to improve the performance of the photoanode, which becomes the bottleneck of the whole PEC water splitting system, the Mo:BiVO4 photoanode was further promoted by reduction by hydrogen generated from the decomposition of NaBH4 at 500 °C for 30 min. As reported previously,23,26,27 the treatment creates  defects that effectively increase the charge carrier density in the BiVO4 lattice to improve its n-type conductivity as shown in the Mott–Schottky plots of Fig. S15.† As a result, the bulk charge separation efficiency (ηbulk) at 1.23 VRHE improves from 10% of bare BiVO4 to 55% for 1% Mo:BiVO4 and finally to ∼90% for doubly modified H, 1% Mo:BiVO4 as shown in Fig. S6.† The procedure to calculate ηbulk is also described in the ESI† based on light absorption data in Fig. S16† and relative photocurrents generated from photo-oxidations of water and the hole scavenger (SO32−). The ηsurf values of all three BiVO4-based photoanodes in Fig. S6† remain very small (<5%). But when CoP is loaded as the OER electrocatalyst, their ηsurf values improve to near 100% above 1.23 eV.

The HER performance of the CoP/Ni foam is compared with that of the standard Pt rod electrocatalyst in Fig. 6a. The performance of the CoP/Ni foam is certainly lower than that of the Pt rod, but the difference is not very large. Now, these HER catalysts were connected to the BiVO4 photoanode as counter cathodes. The IV curves of the CoP/H, 1% Mo:BiVO4 photoanode with the CoP/Ni foam or Pt rod as the H2-evolving counter electrode are compared in Fig. 6b. Both HER cathodes give almost identical IV performance curves of the photoanode showing a high water oxidation photocurrent of ca. 4.7 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. This represents a convincing demonstration that the Pt rod could be replaced with the CoP/Ni foam as the HER electrocatalyst at the cathode matching the high performance of the CoP/H, 1% Mo:BiVO4 photoanode. Even though Pt and CoP/Ni have a performance gap for the HER as shown, the performance of the actual full PEC cell does not show any significant difference. The relatively lower current density scale of the OER compared to the HER makes the overall system efficiency governed by the performance of the photoanode, thus masking the difference in the half-cell performance of the two cathodes. The performance of the CoP/H, 1% Mo:BiVO4 – CoP/Ni foam PEC cell represents one of the highest achieved for metal oxide-based photoanodes with the standard Pt cathode as seen in benchmarking Table S2.†20,39,40,42,43 It is also the highest value recorded for photoanodes with bifunctional electrocatalysts.

Three electrode mode was also tested with the Pt rod as the counter electrode. 
PEC-PV tandem cell for unassisted solar water splitting
For the practical application of the precious metal-free PEC water splitting cell with the bi-functional CoP electrocatalyst demonstrated in the present study, we need to devise an unbiased system that operates with only sun light without external energy input. Tandem alignment of two light absorbers, for example, a BiVO4 photoanode for water oxidation and a photovoltaic cell (multi-junction44,45 or series connected29,46 Si, lead halide perovskite,47etc.), accommodates electrons from the photoanode in order to “boost up” to potentials enough for hydrogen evolution at the counter electrode and achieve overall water splitting.20,29,43–47 Here we develop a tandem cell by hybridization of a PEC cell with a photovoltaic (PV) cell as a bias power generator. The used PV was a 2 piece, series connected crystalline Si (2 ps c-Si) solar cell, whose performance curve is provided in Fig. S17.† The solar cell shows a high open circuit voltage of 1.25 V, which is more important than high photocurrents for this application. Placed behind the photoanode, it still generates photocurrents and voltage sufficient enough to match the currents of the photoanode and cathode.
Thus a tandem cell composed of CoP/H, 1% Mo:BiVO4 as a photoanode, a CoP/Ni foam as a cathode, and the solar cell is schematically shown in Fig. 7a and b. The performance curves of PV and PEC cells cross at ∼4.2 mA cm−2, which becomes the operating point of the tandem cell (Fig. 6b and S18†). The actual operation photocurrent of 4.1 mA cm−2 was observed at 0.0 VRHE, which remained stable for 2 h of continuous operation (Fig. 7c). Solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency can be calculated by using the formula48STH (%) = 1.23 × J × FE/Pwhere J is the photocurrent (mA cm−2), FE is the faradaic efficiency (%) for hydrogen generation, and P is the solar illumination power (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). Thus, our precious metal-free tandem cell gives a STH efficiency of ∼5.3%. There are several successful previous demonstrations of noble metal-free and bias-free PEC cells for solar water splitting, i.e. FeOOH/Mo:BiVO4 – 3jn Si solar cell – NiMo alloy (STH: 2.5%),49 NiFeOx/Al2O3/Si:Fe2O3 – MAPbI3 – NiZnMo alloy (STH: 2.0%),50 and TiCo||BiVO4 – TiNi||p-Si (applied bias-STH: 0.58%).51 The performance of our tandem cell is also similar to that of a tandem cell with a similar configuration, but with a noble metal cathode (Pt), Co-Pi/W:BiVO4 – 2jn a-Si solar cell – Pt, which shows a STH of 5.2%.45 Thus our system presents a new benchmark performance for unassisted solar water splitting devices of the highest efficiency with bifunctional and earth-abundant electrocatalysts.

Conclusion
We have presented an entirely precious metal-free solar water splitting tandem cell with a bifunctional cobalt phosphide electrocatalyst for both OER and HER electrodes and a doubly promoted BiVO4 photoanode. There have been many demonstrations of bifunctional electrocatalysts in electrochemical cells. However, this work represents the first demonstration of a bifunctional metal phosphide catalyzed PEC water splitting cell. But, CoP loaded on the doubly promoted BiVO4 photoanode turns into amorphous CoOx–HPOy with its chemical state and performance very similar to those of well-known cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) electrocatalysts. We have also fabricated a tandem cell made of a CoP/H, 1% Mo:BiVO4 photoanode, CoP/Ni foam cathode, and 2 ps c-Si solar cell that exhibits a STH efficiency of 5.3% in unassisted solar water splitting under 1 sun conditions. The efficiency represents the highest among the precious metal-free systems with the traditional Pt HER electrocatalyst at the cathode replaced with earth abundant elements. Our fabrication method of bifunctional electrocatalysts by drop casting is simple and easily scalable and could be applied to other bifunctional electrocatalysts as well.
