    First published on 26th July 2018AbstractMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as particularly exciting inorganic–organic hybrid porous materials which can be simply self-assembled from their corresponding inorganic metal ions/clusters with organic linkers. MOFs can combine the inherent physical and chemical properties of both inorganic and organic photonic units due to their inorganic–organic hybrid nature. Furthermore, the pores within MOFs can also be utilized to encapsulate a large number of guest species as photonic units. The vast combination possibilities, synergistic effects, as well as controllable and ordered arrangements of multiple photonic units (MPUs) have distinguished MOFs from other inorganic and organic photonic materials and enabled them to be a promising platform to realize novel photonic functional applications. In this review, we summarize the recent and important progress in the design and construction of photonic MOFs, as well as their various applications in luminescence sensing, white-light emission, photocatalysis, nonlinear optics, lasing devices, data storage, and biomedicine. In addition, we highlight the construction strategy and the synergistic effects of MOFs towards achieving high performance and novel photonic functions. Finally, we also outline the challenges in these fields and put forward the prospects and directions for future development.

1. Introduction
Photonics is the science of generating, controlling, and detecting light waves and photons, which plays an essential role in many fields including communication technologies, information processing, military, and biomedicine.1–3 Since photons exhibit great superiority over electrons as information carriers in terms of speed, bandwidth and capacity, photonics provides a promising solution to the current bottlenecks that limit the further improvement of traditional electronics. The photonic devices are making huge impacts on the world today and the flourishing development of optical fibre technology is an excellent example. So far, various photonic devices and applications including luminescent sensors, lighting, nonlinear optical devices, micro/nano laser, 3D patterning and data storage, and photoconductors have been widely demonstrated by utilizing inorganic or organic materials, such as ZnO, CdSe, LiNbO3, π-conjugated macromolecules, and so on.2,4–12 In this respect, the development of novel photonic materials with desired properties for functional applications is of crucial importance and these materials will be the most dominating forces in the field of photonics.
Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) or coordination polymers (CPs) are being intensively studied as an intriguing class of hybrid inorganic–organic materials.13–62 MOFs offer many intriguing properties such as ultrahigh surface area, tunable porosity, and modifiable chemical functionality and thus lead to numerous potential applications in gas storage and separation, catalysis, proton conduction, chemical sensing, and drug delivery.17,20,63–76 In efforts to develop better photonic functional materials, the MOFs have attracted much attention and achieved great experimental success, thus leading us to propose a new concept of “multiple photonic units” (MPUs) to highlight the unique feature of MOFs in this emerging field. MPUs refer to the photo-responsive components and can take different forms, including inorganic metal ions/clusters, organic bridging ligands, and guest species (Fig. 1). Generally, photonic MOFs can be easily synthesized by selecting photo-responsive metal ions/clusters and organic ligands as building blocks. Furthermore, the pores within MOFs can also be utilized to encapsulate a large number of photonic guests such as nanoparticles, metal complexes, and organic dyes to construct photonic MOFs.77–79
 Fig. 1  Conceptual representation of MPUs toward photonic MOFs. 
It is not difficult to envision that the advantages of MOF materials for photonic functional applications are numerous. First, considering the vast combination of inorganic and organic photonic units, the number of potential synthetically accessible MOFs is enormous. Through the deliberate design and selection of photonic units, various photonics applications such as luminescence sensing, tunable light emission, visible light-driven photocatalysis and photodynamic/photothermal theranostics have been successfully demonstrated in MOFs. Second, the MOFs can not only retain the intrinsic properties of each photonic unit, but also further improve and optimize the photonic functionality due to the synergistic effect among MPUs. For example, the 4f–4f transitions of lanthanide ions are parity forbidden, which can be sensitized by the organic ligands through ligand-to-metal energy transfer.51 This advantage has been widely used for luminescence sensing and light emitting applications of MOFs. Finally, it is indicated that the photonic properties of assembled organic molecules depend not only on their molecular structure, but also on their aggregation morphology. The coordination geometry and pore confinement of MOFs will cause the packing of organic ligands and/or guest molecules along a preferential direction and even result in new aggregation morphologies which are radically different from their bulk or solution counterparts. Consequently, compared with conventional amorphous porous materials and polymers, the controllable and ordered arrangements of MPUs within MOFs undoubtedly afford an opportunity to generate novel photonic functionalities. In fact, this has been successful in achieving coordination-induced emission, lasing, and nonlinear optical response in MOFs. In addition, because the pore size and pore shape of MOFs can be easily tuned to match the guest substrates and change the intermolecular distance, and thus to control the energy/charge transfer process among MPUs, the MOFs will bring much flexibility in the realization of complex photonic functional applications.
The vast combination possibilities, synergistic effects, as well as controllable and ordered arrangements of MPUs make MOFs an optimal platform to design and synthesize functionally tailored photonic materials (Fig. 2). MOFs have opened a land of promising applications in photonics fields where conventional inorganic or organic materials might not be suitable. It is necessary to summarize the advances and relationships among framework structures, pore confinements, intermolecular interactions and photonic properties to further direct the design and construction of photonic MOFs. In this review, we will first review the design and construction strategies using MPUs towards photonic MOFs, and then summarize the latest progress in MOFs featuring MPUs for luminescent sensors and highlight the sensing strategy based on different photonic units. The subsequent section discusses the examples of incorporating MPUs within MOFs through rational combination and synergistic effects to achieve tunable luminescence and high-performance white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Then, the recent advances in photocatalytic MOF materials using MPUs as catalytic centers and photosensitizers are surveyed. In the following section, we put emphasis on the orientation behaviours, packing morphologies and the energy/charge transfer process of the MPUs towards achieving novel or enhanced nonlinear optical response. The progress in MOFs for biomedical photonics including luminescence biological imaging, biosensors and photodynamic therapy is then discussed. Finally, we identify the critical challenges in photonic MOFs and put forward the prospects for future development.

2. Design and construction strategies towards photonic MOFs
The library of MPUs is abundant, including lanthanide metal ions, metal clusters, dyes, quantum dots (QDs), organic chromophores, luminescent organic groups, perovskites, etc. Some of these can be designed or selected as the construction units for the framework as secondary building units (SBUs) and linkers while others can be encapsulated into the channels of the MOFs as photonic guests to assemble photonic MOFs. In this section, we will discuss the design strategies towards photonic MOFs according to the three construction units of MOFs, namely SBUs, organic linkers and guests.
2.1 Incorporation of photo-responsive metal ions/clusters
Metal ions/clusters offer the key link nodes for constructing MOFs through coordination with the organic ligands (Fig. 3). The resultant periodic metal–oxygen/nitrogen–carbon clusters are also defined as SBUs.80
 Fig. 3  Strategies for incorporating photo-responsive metal ions/clusters to construct photonic MOFs. 
Lanthanide ions are a series of photo-responsive metal ions with excellent luminescence performance because of the sharp emission spectra and insusceptibility to the environment of the 4f–4f transition. Moreover, the emission wavelength of lanthanide ions is wide enough to cover from blue light to near-infrared: Tm3+, Tb3+, Sm3+ and Eu3+ emit blue, green, orange and red light, respectively, while Yb3+, Nd3+ and Er3+ display near-infrared luminescence.39,52 However, the forbidden f–f transitions make the lanthanide ions difficult to be directly excited. When forming MOFs, the lanthanide ions can be sensitized by the “antenna effect”: the light is absorbed by the ligands and then the absorbed energy is transferred to the excited energy level of the lanthanide ions, and subsequently, the luminescence is generated from the lanthanide ions. Incorporation of lanthanide ions into MOFs affords Ln-MOFs, which were largely investigated in the past decade.31,39 Because of the very similar chemical properties of lanthanide ions, the Ln-SBUs can be easily replaced by each other, affording mixed-Ln-MOFs, which may display the characteristic emissions of each lanthanide ion in the meantime. For example, by doping Eu3+ into an isostructural Tb-MOF to form a mixed-Ln-MOF EuxTb1−xDMBDC (DMBDC = 2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), a targeted self-referencing luminescent thermometer based on the emissions of Tb3+ and Eu3+ was realized in a wide temperature range from 10 to 300 K.81 Even more lanthanide ions are able to be incorporated into MOFs to realize colour tuning and up-conversion materials.82,83 Different from the traditional solid-solution type mixed-Ln-MOF mentioned above, core–shell type mixed-Ln-MOF hierarchical single crystals were also achieved via a solution-mediated epitaxial growth method.84 In the resultant MOF crystals, each component can maintain its own luminescence property, and multicolor to white light emissions are realized through the color mixing technique by controlling the domain and orientation of the hierarchical crystals (Fig. 4).

Although rarely reported, the 5d–4f transitions of lanthanide ions may also be utilized to construct photonic MOFs, which show a much higher dependence on the coordination environment of the metal ions compared to f–f transitions because of the participation of d states. They provide broader absorption and emission bands without the antenna effect, as the 5d–4f transitions are parity allowed. Some examples in this field were reported by Müller-Buschbaum et al.85–87 By reactions of the metals Eu and Sr together with a melt of 1H-imidazole (Im), 3∞[Sr1−xEux(Im)2] was obtained where both metal ions were divalent. Upon excitation, a broad emission band attributed to divalent europium was observed, indicating the transitions between the 5d energy levels and the 4f 8S7/2 levels. Similarly, a Ce3+-based MOF 3∞[Ce(Tz)3] (Tz = 1,2,3-triazolate) exhibited an intense, blue d–f-emission, which was reported by the same group.
Recently, the utilization of photo-responsive metal clusters to construct photonic MOFs has aroused research interest. Inspired by the excellent luminescence properties of copper bidentate ligands, Li et al. assembled the 0D-Cu4I4 cluster into 1D-, 2D-, and 3D-frameworks via strong Cu–N bonds, achieving high performance hybrid lighting phosphors.88,89 Among these hybrid organic–inorganic compounds, for those containing aromatic ligands, the atomic states that make up the conduction band minimum (CBM) are mostly from organic ligands (C 2p and N 2p), while the inorganic components (Cu 3d and I 5p) offer the atomic states in the valence band maximum (VBM) region. Therefore, the luminescence is originated from the metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) or halogen to ligand charge transfer (XLCT) process. For those compounds built of aliphatic ligands, both CBM and VBM are composed of inorganic atomic states, and thus the emission is primarily cluster centred. Silver(I) chalcogenide/chalcogenolate clusters can also be utilized as photonic metal nodes for the construction of MOFs, which is presented by Zang, Mak and coworkers.90 The luminescent Ag12 cluster deteriorated very fast in air; however, when forming MOFs with the organic ligand bpy (4,4′-bipyridine), the Ag12bpy crystals retained the crystallinity for one year under ambient conditions. Interestingly, Ag12 emits weak red light (620 nm) in air, while the emission peak of Ag12bpy is located at 507 nm, which indicates that formation of MOFs may change the excited state. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that luminescence of Ag12 originates from the mixture of LMCT and metal-centred transitions. In contrast, the excited states of Ag12bpy belong to MLCT (Ag(I)-to-bpy) with some mixing of ligand (S,O)-to-bpy.
2.2 Functionalization of organic ligands
Compared to the relatively limited choices of photonic metal ions/clusters, photonic responsive organic ligands are numerous and can be easily modified. Functionalization methods for the organic ligands include extending the length of the ligands, solvent-assisted linker exchange and adding or replacing functional groups on the ligands, as illustrated in Fig. 5.91
 Fig. 5  Three strategies for functionalization of organic ligands. 
Yaghi and coworkers presented a preeminent example of synthesizing isoreticular IRMOF-74-I to IRMOF-74-XI by extending the length of the organic ligands.61 Specifically, expanding the ligand of MOF-74 from one phenylene ring to two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine and eleven affords IRMOF-74-II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, IX and XI. A similar synthesis strategy was then successfully applied to the NOTT-series,92 fcu-MOFs,93 UiO-series,94 and so on. Adjusting the length of the ligands can not only adjust the pore size of the photonic MOFs which makes MOFs suitable for encapsulating various photonic species, but also enable the multiple functions of MOFs. For example, Lin et al. designed a series of isoreticular chiral MOFs [L1Cu2(solvent)2], where L1 is the chiral tetracarboxylate ligand derived from 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol.73 On functionalization with Ti(OiPr)4 through post-synthesis, chiral Lewis acid catalysts were generated and the resulting materials can convert aromatic aldehydes into chiral secondary alcohols for diethylzinc and alkynylzinc additions. Importantly, by tuning the size of the channels, the enantioselectivities of these reactions can be modified through the alteration of the diffusion rates of the organic substrates.
The ligand exchange process was developed to overcome the difficulty of direct synthesis of some photonic functional MOFs. It is a very promising strategy because it represents a potentially universal method for constructing new MOFs which may be thermodynamically unfavourable. Cohen and coworkers investigated the anionic carboxylate ligand exchange in robust MOFs, including MIL-53(Al), MIL-68(In), UiO-66(Zr) and ZIF-71.95 Through the solvent assisted ligand exchange process, a dual ligand MOF MIL-53(Al)-Br/NH2 can be obtained from the mixture of MIL-53(Al)-NH2 and MIL-53(Al)-Br. A similar phenomenon was observed in the case of MIL-68(In), UiO-66(Zr) and ZIF-71. The ligand exchange can also be applied to adjust the pore size of MOFs. Cubic crystal bio-MOF-100 consists of zinc-adeninate clusters linked by 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (H2BPDC), where BPDC can be exchanged by the slightly longer ligand azobenzene-4,4′-dicarboxylate (ABDC) and the much longer ligand 2′-amino-1,1′:4,1′′-terphenyl-4,4′′-dicarboxylate (NH2-TPDC), affording bio-MOF-102 and bio-MOF-103.96 The cell lengths of the analogue cubic bio-MOF-100, bio-MOF-102 and bio-MOF-103 are 68.90, 75.24 and 82.25 Å, respectively.
There are numerous photonic functional organic groups, such as amino group, conjugate aromatic group, and azide, that can be introduced in the ligands. It is easy to functionalize organic ligands with these organic groups without destruction  of the frameworks through in situ synthesis, linker exchange or post-synthesis. For example, Eddaoudi and coworkers reported a 12-connected rare-earth SBU based fcu-MOF, linked by 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylate (1,4-NDC).97 Afterwards, by replacing the ligand 1,4-NDC by 2-aminoterephthalate (BDC-NH2), 2-fluoroterephthalate (BDC-F), or 2-nitroterephthalate (BDC-NO2) in the reaction mixture, a series of fcu-MOFs were obtained under similar reaction conditions.98 Post-synthesis of functional groups is another widely applied approach to functionalize organic linkers. Generally, an active site on the ligand is a prerequisite which can afford chemical reactions for the transfer of another functional group. Qian et al. functionalized the pyridyl sites within MOF-867 with methyl groups, affording a cationic framework ZJU-101 for the removal of anionic Cr2O72−.99 Through a diazotization route, the amino groups on IRMOF-3 were successfully converted to azide, which can be reversibly reduced into amino by H2S, leading to a turn-on fluorescence H2S probe.100
Forgan et al. investigated the influence of organic groups on the structures and properties of MOFs in a series of isostructural Zr-MOFs.101 It was found that naphthyl and benzothiadiazolyl modified Zr-MOFs can act as fluorescent water sensors, introduction of dimethyl units yields MOFs that display a temperature dependent phase change, and the tetrafluorinated analogue exhibits superhydrophobicity. However, the understanding of the effect of ligand functionalization on the framework is still very limited. A study of the effect of polar functional groups on the dynamics of the frameworks based on the isostructural ZIF-8, ZIF-90 and ZIF-65 revealed that high pressure can convert ZIF-90 to a “gate open” phase, while ZIF-65 undergoes a transition to a “gate closed” structure, which was demonstrated by Moggach et al.102 The postsynthetic modification (PSM) of ligands was demonstrated by Rosi et al. using a porous pcu MOF platform based on the Ln4(μ3-OH)4(COO)62+ cluster (Fig. 6).103 Through the covalent modification at the amino group sites within a near-infrared emitting MOF, MOF-1114(Yb), the excitation energy for Yb3+ sensitization can be carefully adjusted to lower energy, thus successfully shifting the excitation wavelengths into the range suitable for biological imaging applications. The introduction of organic groups may change the excited state or energy level of the ligands and the energy transfer processes within MOFs, resulting in numerous photonic functional MOFs, which will be discussed in the following sections.

2.3 Encapsulation of photonic species within MOFs
Apart from the intrinsic luminescence of the frameworks, encapsulating photonic species is a very important strategy to enlarge the luminescence modes of MOFs, taking advantage of their large and ordered pore structure. There are plenty of light emitters that have been successfully doped into MOFs, including lanthanide ions,104 quantum dots (QDs),105,106 organic dyes,107,108etc.
MOFs without special design may not tightly encapsulate the photonic species into the pores through the simple adsorption processes (Fig. 7a); however, this does not affect the most photonic applications of MOFs. Falcaro and coworkers incorporated highly luminescent semiconductor QDs into MOF-5 through a one-pot method, affording QD@MOF-5 composites.105 Investigations into the QD distribution within the QD@MOF-5 showed that these inclusions were homogeneously distributed in the framework. Combining the sieving properties provided by the MOF and the QD as a luminescent probe, these composites exhibited the quenching effect on ethanethiol and n-isopropyl acrylamide/acrylic acid/t-butyl acrylamide mercaptane. Recently, Yan et al. investigated the photonic performances of micrometer size isostructural crystalline Tb-BTC (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate), Eu-BTC and Eu doped Tb-BTC.109 All the three Ln-MOFs exhibited an optical waveguide effect with a low waveguide loss coefficient and high photoluminescence quantum yield, which indicates that the Eu3+ in the pores have similar photonic functions as the Eu3+ in the SBUs in this situation.

(c) Electrostatic interaction between frameworks and guests. (d) Coordination sites on frameworks for guests. (e) MOFs as a template for direct conversion of guests within the channels; reproduced with permission from ref. 119, copyright 2017 Nature Publishing Group. 
However, in order to realize some special structures or applications, an elaborate design of the host–guest system must be taken into consideration (Fig. 7b–e). This is largely investigated in COFs, supramolecular and porous organic polymers.110–113 Because of the significant structural flexibility of MOFs, the design of the host–guest system should also be taken into account. For instance, Huo and coworkers found that polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) modified nanoparticles can be well dispersed and fully confined within the ZIF-8 crystals.114 Besides, the spatial distribution of nanoparticles within ZIF-8 can be controlled by adjusting the time of addition of the nanoparticles during the MOF-formation reaction. Further experimental results demonstrated that the PVP-modified nanoparticles can be successively adsorbed on the continuously forming fresh surfaces of the growing coordination-polymer spheres. Another example was presented by Qian et al.: the pore size of the as-synthesized ZJU-68 was exactly matched with the size of the dye 4-[p-(dimethylamino)styryl]-1-methylpyridinium (DMASM), therefore the dye molecules were tightly confined and highly oriented, leading to a polarized three-photon-pumped laser in single solid-state microcrystals.107
To improve the loading efficiency of photonic species within MOFs, redundant coordination sites on the frameworks are often utilized. The coordination between the guest species and the frameworks can also lead to a more efficient energy transfer between hosts and guests. Qian et al. fabricated CPM-5 and MIL-100(In) films and then loaded Tb3+ under the same condition, respectively.115 MIL-100(In) has uncoordinated carboxylate groups which can chelate with Tb3+, while CPM-5 can only physically absorb Tb3+. The quantum yield of Tb3+ coordinated MIL-100(In) is about 16.8%, whereas that of Tb3+ absorbed CPM-5 is only 1.1%. The much higher quantum yield of the former material is ascribed to the shorter donor–acceptor distance due to the coordination structure. Similarly, Yan and coworkers coordinated Eu3+ on the N,N-chelating sites of the ligand biphenyl-5,5′-dicarboxylate (bpydc), realizing a fluorescent MOF-based ammonia sensor.116
The electrostatic force between hosts and guests has also been investigated in the last few years. For example, DMASM is a cationic dye with red emission at 628 nm. It can be introduced into the anionic framework bio-MOF-1 via an ion-exchange process and the electrostatic force helps to anchor the dye molecules within MOF pores.117 Furthermore, a 3D framework ZJU-21 with polarized benzothiadiazole moieties on the ligand showed a very efficient absorption behaviour towards DMASM.118 Very recently, Li and coworkers reported the first example of incorporating perovskite nanoparticles into MOFs through a direct conversion process triggered by a halide salt, n-butanol solution containing CH3NH3Br, which expanded the encapsulation strategies of photonic guest species within MOFs (Fig. 7e).119
The encapsulation of carbon nanodots (CDs) into MOFs was also realized by Zhang et al. by impregnating porous MOFs with glucose and calcination of the glucose at low temperature.120 Glucose is an economical carbon source with a fairly small size, which can be loaded into the pores of MOFs from the liquid phase and can be carbonized at low temperature (Fig. 8). After the glucose has infiltrated the pores of the as-prepared MOF, the glucose-loaded MOF is heated at 200 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Because the framework is stable at this temperature, the CDs formed by calcination are confined to the MOF pores, thus yielding a well-defined CD-loaded MOF. The CD-loaded MOF thin film was also grown on quartz glass and provided a good optical-limiting property at 532 nm.

Besides single-phase MOFs, the hierarchical MOF microcrystals can be utilized as a host matrix to encapsulate multiple photonic species with precise position control and thus to tune the guest-to-host and guest-to-guest interactions. To demonstrate this concept, Tsung et al. introduced a pair of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) chromophore molecules, rhodamine 6G (R6G) and 7-amino-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin (C-151), as the molecule guests, and Pd nanoparticles as the heterogeneous guests into the multi-shelled hollow ZIF-8.121 They firstly fixed different types of guest species in different layers of the multi-layered ZIF-67@ZIF-8 MOF crystal during the epitaxial growth process. The multi-layered ZIF-67@ZIF-8 MOF shows a well-defined onion structure because ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 share the same topology but different Zn and Co nodes, respectively. Subsequently, the ZIF-67 layers are dissociated to form the hollow cavity layers between the ZIF-8 layers. As a result, the guests originally fixed in ZIF-8 layers are still fixed in the ZIF-8 shells, while the guests originally fixed in the ZIF-67 layers are released and encapsulated in the hollow cavities between ZIF-8 shells. Through this method, the well-defined single-shelled hollow ZIF-8, double-shelled hollow ZIF-8, triple-shelled ZIF-8, quadruple-shelled hollow ZIF-8, and yolk–shell ZIF-8 (Fig. 9) have been synthesized. By precisely fixing the guests in the MOF shells or encapsulating them in the cavities between the MOF shells, the energy transfer (ET) interactions between different guests can be regulated.

3. MOFs for luminescent sensors
Compared with the traditional sensing approach, luminescence sensing can offer faster response, higher sensitivity, better immunity to electromagnetic interference, safer operation in an explosive or combustive atmosphere, and the possibility of remote monitoring. Benefitting from the fruitful energy/charge transfer process among MPUs and analytes, the luminescence properties of MOFs are very sensitive to their structural characteristics, coordination environment, nature of the pore surfaces, and their interactions with guest species through coordination bonds, π–π interactions, hydrogen bonding, etc., thus providing the solid rationale to develop luminescent MOF sensors.31,39,49,122–129 In addition, the MPUs within MOFs are very useful to design and develop ratiometric sensors to eliminate external interference.13,122,130–132 The advantages and challenges of MOFs for luminescence sensing have been well summarized by several previous review articles.31,39,52,132 Therefore, we will not simply list a large number of examples of the MOF sensors, and will concentrate on exploring the remarkable sensing strategy of these materials, which is essential to further guide the photonic MOF design and synthesis to meet the grand challenges of practical sensing applications.
3.1 Functional sites within MOFs for selective luminescence sensing
Incorporating functional sites such as open metal sites, Lewis acidic sites, and Lewis basic pyridyl sites can improve the sensitivity of MOFs to environmental changes and the selectivity to analytes.133,134 One of the earliest examples utilizing open metal sites for luminescence sensing of small molecules was realized by Chen, Qian and coworkers.135 The open Eu3+ site was obtained by calcining Eu(BTC) at 140 °C under vacuum for 24 h. When the N,N-dimethylmethanamide (DMF) or acetone solvent was gradually added into the Eu(BTC) 1-propanol emulsion, the 5D0 → 7F2 emission intensity of Eu3+ exhibited respectively enhancement or decrement, indicating that the weakly coordinated 1-propanol molecules on the Eu3+ open sites were gradually replaced by DMF or acetone molecules. Similarly, owing to the interaction of NH3 with open metal sites, Dinca et al. reported two MOFs, Zn2(TCPE) (TCPE = tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)ethylene) and Mg(H2DHBDC) (H2DHBDC = 2, 5-dihydroxybenzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid), for the selective detection of gaseous ammonia at elevated temperatures.136 Zhang and coworkers also reported a Eu-MOF, which was formed by single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation, that showed multi-luminescence sensing of acetone, aliphatic alcohol, explosive 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) and Cu2+, as the incorporated accessible Lewis basic sites and coordinated water molecules act as signal transmission media.128
Although researchers realized that functional sites play an important role in the fluorescence sensing properties, most early research studies on MOF sensors failed to provide a deep illustration of the sensing mechanism. However, with the rapid development of MOF sensors, the investigation of the sensing mechanism is extremely urgent. Recently, Jiang and coworkers reported Tb(BTC) nanocrystals utilizing the quenching effect for the sensing of picric acid (PA).137 They proposed a mechanism in which the excited electrons in Tb(BTC) are prone to transfer into the PA molecules due to the lower LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) level of PA compared to other analytes and the strong supramolecular interaction, such as hydrogen bonding, between Tb(BTC) and PA molecules. In 2015, Li et al. deeply discussed the electron transfer process between MOF sensors and analytes for fast and sensitive sensing of Aflatoxin B1.138 The MOF LMOF-241 was synthesized by using mixed-ligand H2BPDC and 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(4-(pyridin-4-yl)phenyl)ethane (TPPE) and it exhibited a channel diameter of 16.6 Å, which is very suitable for the concentration of Aflatoxin molecules. After the addition of Aflatoxin B1, the emission intensity of LMOF-241 was significantly quenched, and the limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to be 46 ppb, much better than 300 ppb, which is the tolerant level set by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).139 An explanation for the quenching effect is the efficient electron transfer from LMOF-241 to Aflatoxin B1 since the calculated LUMO energy state of LMOF-241 lies above the LUMO energy state of Aflatoxin B1. Banerjee and coworkers reported a solvatochromic MOF constructed from an electron deficient ligand N,N′-bis(5-isophthalic acid)naphthalenediimide (H4BINDI) for the detection of organic amines.140 They measured the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy of the MOF as −6.02 eV, which is lower than that of organic amine analytes, and thus the donor–acceptor electron transfer between MOF and amines can happen and quench the emission intensity of the MOF.141 Yan and coworkers represented an example of luminescence quenching based MOF sensors based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer from the ligand to analytes.142 A 3D framework Ga(OH)(btec)·0.5H2O (btec = 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylate) was functionalized with Eu3+, and the resulting material showed an excellent sensing property to 1-hydroxypyrene based on fluorescence quenching. The large overlap between the absorption spectrum of 1-hydroxypyrene and the emission spectrum of the MOF ligand, which competitively inhibits the energy transfer from the ligand to Eu3+, led to the quenching effect of the emission of Eu3+.
With the better understanding of the luminescence sensing mechanism of MOFs, the possibility of designing low LOD MOF sensors has significantly improved. Zhao and coworkers designed a heterometallic cationic MOF [Ln2Zn(L2)3(H2O)4](NO3)2·12H2O (L2 = 4,4′-dicarboxylate-2,2′-dipyridine), which can catalyse I− oxidation into I2, enabling the detection of I− in aqueous solutions at a concentration of 0.001 ppm.143 By revealing the resonance energy transfer and electron transfer mechanism between picric acid and the MOF, Konar et al. demonstrated a high-selectivity MOF sensor for detecting picric acid even at a concentration of 1.5 ppm.144 Very recently, Wang and coworkers developed an ionizing radiation fluorescent sensor based on a uranyl organic framework (TMA)2[(UO2)4(ox)4L3] (L3 = succinate), as shown in Fig. 10.145 The photoluminescence of this material originates from the HOMO–LUMO transition in the uranyl hybridized molecular orbitals. When exposed to radiations, the CO of the ligand breaks, affording oxo-radicals that can be stabilized within the conjugated uranium oxalate–carboxylate sheet, leading to a substantially enhanced equatorial bonding of the uranyl ions, which may effectively quench the luminescence through phonon-assisted relaxation. Utilizing the ligand 5-(2-(5-fluoro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)isophthalic acid (H2hpi2cf) with excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), Su and coworkers constructed a Zn-MOF which exhibited an ultrafast water sensing ability.146 The dehydrated Zn-MOF displays a normal ESIPT process with the cyan emission at 493 nm. In contrast, the H-bonding between water and the –OH group in the hydrated phase effectively hampers the ESIPT, leading to the enol emission of the ligand at 463 nm.

Obviously, the chemical stability of MOFs has been recognized as a crucial issue in relation to practical luminescence sensing applications. However, most MOFs are unstable in water or moisture due to the fragile SBUs constructed by coordination bonds.69,147 Impressively, UiO-66 synthesized by Lillerud and coworkers shows excellent stability with the SBU of the Zr6O4 cluster.94 From then on, the Zr6O4 cluster is largely utilized to construct stable MOFs. Li, Zhou and coworkers reported two extremely water stable isostructural Zr-based MOFs, BUT-12 and BUT-13, for the detection of antibiotics and organic explosives in water.148 The high luminescence quenching efficiency was attributed to a combining effect from electron and energy transfer in the host–guest systems. With the benefit of the good adsorption ability toward nitrofurazone (NZF) and TNP, the detection sensitivity values of the two MOFs toward NZF are 58 and 90 ppb, and those for TNP are 23 and 10 ppb, respectively. Jiang et al. also reported a water-stable zirconium-porphyrin MOF (PCN-225) as a pH sensor utilizing the functional nitrogen atoms in the ligand as functional sites.149 This material exhibits exceptional chemical stability in aqueous solutions with pH ranging from 1 to 11. As a result of the wide pH range stability and the presence of fluorescent porphyrin dye, the luminescence intensity of PCN-225 increased with increasing pH in the whole experimental range (0–10.2), demonstrating an excellent pH sensing ability.
3.2 Turn-on luminescence sensing
Up to now, the majority of luminescence-based MOF sensors operate by the turn-off mechanism of the luminescence quenching effect. Many disturbing factors, such as the nonradiative energy transition and luminescence self-absorption, may lead to fake detection results for luminescence quenching based sensors.136,150 In contrast, the turn-on detection, in which the interaction of the MOFs with analytes can turn a relatively “dark” material into a luminescent one, can avoid the fake detection results caused by nonradiative transition, thus enhancing the signal to noise ratio and making them more sensitive to lower concentration of analytes. However, the use of MOFs for turn-on luminescence sensing is still in its infancy. To realize such turn-on sensing, the MOFs must be deliberately designed for the unique energy transfer process which can be positively tuned by the analytes.
Generally, most organic chromophores are highly emissive in solution but become weak or even totally annihilated when the molecules are aggregated. As illustrated by Briks in 1970, such aggregation-caused-quenching (ACQ) effect is common to most aromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives.151 Since the common structure of organic chromophores is based on π-conjugation, the big conjugate ring increased the chance for such luminophores to form excimers or exciplexes, which indeed will quench the emission of chromophores. However, some organic molecules can exhibit the opposite effect: they do not show emission when dissolved in good solvents but become highly emissive upon aggregation in poor solvents or in the solid state. This process is termed as aggregation-induced emission (AIE), which makes it possible to actively utilize the aggregation process, instead of passively working against it. In 2011, Dinca et al. described the new matrix coordination-induced emission effect (MCIE) through coordinative immobilization of an AIE ligand TCPE within rigid porous MOFs.152 The MOFs Zn2(TCPE)(H2O)2·4DEF (DEF = N,N-diethylformamide) and Cd2(TCPE) (DEF)(C2H5OH)2·DEF exhibit strong “turn-on” emission at 480 nm and 455 nm, respectively, similar to that of the solid ligand H4TCPE, whose maximum emission wavelength is 480 nm. In addition, these MOFs exhibit biexponential fluorescence decay behaviors with values similar to those observed for solid H4TCPE. This result demonstrates that anchoring AIE-type molecules within MOFs is an effective method to turn on fluorescence by restricting the rotation of the phenyl rings, which may be useful to develop new turn-on luminescent MOF sensors.
The guest species incorporated into the pores of MOFs can affect the energy transfer between metal ions and ligands, providing a possible way for designing turn-on luminescent sensors. Song and coworkers reported a MOF, [Eu2L43(H2O)4]·3DMF (L4 = 2′,5′-bis(methoxymethyl)-[1,1′:4′,1′′-terphenyl]4,4′′-dicarboxylate), which after being activated with distilled water can act as a turn-on luminescent sensor for DMF vapor.153 When exposed to the DMF vapor, the activated MOF exhibits more than eightfold enhancement of luminescence intensity. Such a significant turn-on effect triggered by DMF is partly attributed to the replacement of the H2O, which may lead to the quenching effect because of the stretching of the O–H bond. Furthermore, the DMF molecules incorporated into the channels can modulate the energy levels of the ligand, and thus promote the efficiency of the ligand-to-metal energy transfer (LMET) process. Increasing the concentration of guest species in the pores of MOFs is an efficient way to improve the sensitivity of MOF sensors. Ghosh and coworkers designed a cationic porous framework utilizing a chelating N-donor ligand for anion sensing.154 The cationic framework, [Zn(L5)(H2O)2](NO3)2·2H2O (L5 = (1E,1′E)-N,N′-(ethane-1,2-diylbis(4,1-phenylene))bis(1-(pyridin-2-yl)methanimine)), was obtained by single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation, and the coordinated NO3− guest anions can be replaced by N(CN)2− and ClO4− anions through an anion exchange process. The N(CN)2− and ClO4− anion exchanged materials showed a high enhancement of fluorescence, which may due to the enhanced intra-ligand interactions by the change in the structure of anion exchanged frameworks.
In 2015, Manos et al. reported a Mg2+-based MOF for detecting traces of water in organic solvents through turn-on luminescence.155 The as-synthesized three-dimensional AEMOF-1·DMAc (DMAC = N,N-dimethylacetamide) displays a 1D channel and possesses breathing capability by removal/readsorption of DMAc guest molecules. The guest-free compound, named AEMOF-1′, showed two types of signal transduction for water in THF (tetrahydrofuran): the enhancement of luminescence and the shift of the emission peak. Remarkably, a considerable change in the emission spectra of AEMOF-1′ can be observed at a water concentration as low as 0.05% v/v. They further investigated the sensing mechanism through calculation and found that the occurrence of redistribution electron density after the hydrogen-bond formation affected the energy transfer process within the framework.
In recent years, many researchers seek for clever ways to realize luminescent turn-on MOF sensors. Chi and coworkers synthesized a Ru(bpy)32+-functionalized bio-MOF-1 fluorescence sensor with a LOD of 8.2 pM for Hg2+ in water.156 The dopant Ru(bpy)32+ species were immobilized at the frameworks via electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged bio-MOF-1 framework and positively charged Ru(bpy)32+. With the addition of Hg2+, the adenine can strongly and selectively bind with Hg2+, which increases the positive charges of the framework, causing the disassembly of the outside layer of Ru(bpy)32+ and the exposure of the inner part of the framework to Hg2+, which triggers the further collapse of the framework. The release of large amounts of Ru(bpy)32+ species into the solution leads to a great enhancement of luminescence intensity. Jiang and coworkers developed quite a novel catalytic reaction-based signal amplification MOF probe PCN-222-Pd(II) for Cu2+ in water.157 Such sensor is realized by three steps: (1) PCN-222-Pd(II) is obtained by inserting Pd2+ into the porphyrin center; (2) Pd2+ can be easily replaced by an equal amount of Cu2+ and reduced into Pd nanoparticles because of the stronger binding affinity between porphyrin and Cu2+; (3) under the catalysis of Pd nanoparticles, the aniline can be converted to a fluorescent ring-closing product.
More recently, Qian et al. proposed a quench-turn-on strategy to detect hydrogen sulfide.158 As shown in Fig. 11, they incorporated Eu3+ and Cu2+ into the UiO-66-(COOH)2 framework simultaneously, in which Cu2+ can totally quench the luminescence emission of Eu3+. After the addition of hydrogen sulfide, the H2S will interact with Cu2+ and thus the luminescence of Eu3+ turns on. Zang, Mak and coworkers also reported a quench-turn-on strategy to develop a luminescent sensor using a silver-chalcogenolate cluster-based MOF.90 They prepared a luminescent dodecanuclear silver chalcogenide cluster (Ag12) and then used bpy to replace the coordinated CH3CN of Ag12 to construct MOF Ag12bpy. Because of the complete openness of the pores, bare emissive chromophore and the appropriate lifetime of the triplet state, O2 can freely diffuse into the channels of the MOF, dynamically collide with chromophores and switch off their emission. Afterwards, the emission of Ag12bpy can be turned on by volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Interestingly, the emission shows a bathochromic shift with increasing solvent polarity (Fig. 12). The single crystal XRD and variable-temperature emission spectra of Ag12bpy·VOCs demonstrated that the solvatochromism of Ag12bpy is attributable to the dipole–dipole interactions between the framework and guest molecules.

3.3 Self-referencing luminescence sensing based on dual-emitting MOFs
Although great research efforts have been made for MOF luminescent sensors, most examples reported including turn-on sensors are based on the intensity changes of the single emission. However, intensity changes may not always be the precise mode of recognition because they may include false responses or an erroneous observation triggered by changes of the external environment. In addition to the different absorption and scatter efficiency of different samples, even if the overall experimental conditions are kept constant during the measurements, the luminescence intensity may vary from sample to sample, which may lead to the erroneous conclusions. Considering all these, the ratiometric luminescent sensors, which utilize the ratio between the intensity of two MPUs within the same luminescent material, are developed for overcoming the main drawbacks of the single emission-based luminescence sensors. Fig. 13 illustrates the general phenomenon and mechanism of dual-emitting sensing. Usually there are energy transfer processes between MPU-A and MPU-B in dual-emitting MOFs (Fig. 13a). When the external environment (temperature, solvents, ions, etc.) changes, the energy transfer processes may be promoted or hampered, resulting in energy reallocation between MPU-A and MPU-B, which changes the ratio of luminescence intensity IA/IB. However, in some systems, there is no energy transfer between MPUs and the dual emissions are originated from either two independent photonic units (Fig. 13b) or two independent excited energy levels within one photonic unit (Fig. 13c). In these systems, the analytes may affect the emissions of MPUs independently, which also results in the change of IA/IB.
 Fig. 13  Dual-emissions in MOFs originated from (a) energy transfer, (b) two independent photonic units, and (c) two independent excited energy levels within one photonic unit. 
Dual-emitting MOF sensors are firstly and henceforth largely developed as thermometers because most of the energy transfer efficiency among MPUs of MOFs is strongly dependent on the temperature (Table 1).81,159,160 Luminescent MOF thermometers also possess unique advantages over some conventional thermometers, such as fast response, high sensitivity, inertness to strong electric or magnetic fields, noninvasive operation and biological application.13,122 Doping different lanthanide ions as MPUs into isostructural MOF materials to construct mixed-Ln-MOFs is an effective strategy to design dual-emitting MOFs for ratiometric luminescence sensing. In the resultant mixed-Ln-MOFs, simultaneous emissions of different lanthanide ions can be observed using one excitation wavelength and any desired lanthanide compositions can be tuned in a predictable and reproducible fashion by controlling the stoichiometry of the reactants. In 2012, Qian, Cui et al. firstly reported a ratiometric luminescent MOF thermometer based on a Eu3+/Tb3+ mixed-Ln-MOF, Eu0.0069Tb0.9931-DMBDC.81 The emission of the Eu3+ ions in mixed-Ln-MOFs was sensitized by the Tb3+ ions within the same frameworks, which was confirmed by the emission spectra excited at 488 nm of the 7F6 → 5D4 transition from the Tb3+ ions. With the increment of temperature from 10 to 300 K, the emission intensity of 5D4 → 7F5 (Tb3+, 545 nm) of Eu0.0069Tb0.9931-DMBDC decreased, while that of 5D0 → 7F2 (Eu3+, 613 nm) increased (Fig. 14b), which is attributed to the temperature-dependent energy transfer process from Tb3+ to Eu3+ ions, as further confirmed by luminescence lifetime measurements. The different temperature dependent luminescence emissions in the same compound enabled it to act as a self-referencing luminescent thermometer. The intensity ratio (ITb/IEu) of the 5D4 → 7F5 (Tb3+, 545 nm) to 5D0 → 7F2 (Eu3+, 613 nm) transitions is linearly related to the temperature from 50 to 200 K with the maximum relative sensitivity of 1.15% K−1 at 200 K, indicating that Eu0.0069Tb0.9931-DMBDC can measure the temperature in this range with a maximum relative sensitivity (Sm) of 1.15% K−1. In addition, the tunable luminescence colors from green-yellow to red from 10 to 300 K allow direct visualization of the temperature change instantly and straightforwardly (Fig. 14c). Such a Tb3+/Eu3+ mixed-Ln-MOF featuring temperature-dependent luminescence enables itself to be an excellent self-referencing luminescent thermometer.

Liu, Bouwman and coworkers investigated the phonon-assisted energy-transfer mechanisms in the ratiometric cryogenic temperature sensor, Tb0.95Eu0.05HL6 (L6 = 5-hydroxy-1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylate). When the temperature increases from 4 to 50 K, the energy in the excited state of Tb3+ is easier to migrate to a Tb3+ ion neighboring a Eu3+ center with low energy phonons.161 Therefore, the MOF Tb0.95Eu0.05HL6 shows good sensing performance in a wide temperature range, especially in the range 4–50 K, with a sensitivity up to 31% K−1 at 4 K.
By varying the triplet excited state energy of the organic linkers, the energy transfer processes may be tuned, and thus higher relative sensitivity and wider response range of luminescent thermometers can be realized. This was demonstrated in another three mixed-Ln-MOFs, Tb0.9Eu0.1PIA (PIA = 5-(pyridin-4-yl)isophthalate),162 Tb0.957Eu0.043cpda (cpda = 5-(4-carboxyphenyl)-2,6-pyridinedicarboxylate),163 and Tb0.8Eu0.2BPDA,164 whose ligands exhibit higher triplet state energy of 25866, 27027 and 25269 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 15). The response temperature ranges of Tb0.9Eu0.1PIA, Tb0.957Eu0.043cpda and Tb0.8Eu0.2BPDA are from 100 to 300 K, from 40 to 300 K and from 298 to 318 K, and their maximum relative sensitivities are calculated to be 3.27% K−1, 16.03% K−1 and 1.19% K−1, respectively.

The scale down of MOF thermometers may increase the potential applications of these materials in many fields. Carlos and coworkers reported nanoscale mixed-Ln-MOF thermometers in the range of physiological temperatures (300–320 K).168 They prepared the nanorods of MOF Tb0.99Eu0.01(BDC)1.5(H2O)2 by a reverse microemulsion method. Aqueous suspensions of the nano-MOF display a relative sensitivity of 0.37% K−1 at 318 K. Carlos and coworkers prepared another mixed-Ln-MOF, [(Tb0.914Eu0.086)2(pda)3(H2O)]·2H2O (H2pda = 1,4-phenylenediacetic acid), as a nanothermometer by the spray-drying method recently.167 Interestingly, the emission of the ligand in the bulk material disappeared in the nanoscale one, while the quantum yield of the emission of lanthanide ions in the nanoscale MOF is much larger than that of the bulk MOF, clearly demonstrating the enormous advantage of nanoscale MOFs. The ratiometric nanothermometer displays excellent detecting property in cryogenic systems (10–100 K), with high sensitivity (around 5.96 K−1 at 5 K) and low-temperature uncertainty (0.02 K at 25 K).
As mentioned before, MOF thermometers possess several advantages in the applications in the biological field. Among them, near-infrared (NIR) excited luminescent MOFs are more prior in biological systems due to the high penetration depth of NIR emission in tissues and no competing luminescence from biomatrices.178 Qian and coworkers reported a NIR luminescent MOF thermometer Nd0.577Yb0.423BDC-F4, based on the ligand 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2BDC-F4).169 The ligand was deliberately chosen with the triplet excited energy state of 27465 cm−1, which is much higher than the accepted level of Nd3+ or Yb3+ ions for preventing their mutual interactions, and the weaker vibration bond of C–F in contrast to the C–H bond can reduce the quenching effect of NIR luminescence. Upon excitation at 808 nm, Nd0.577Yb0.423BDC-F4 simultaneously displayed the characteristic emission of the Nd3+ and Yb3+ ions, in which Yb3+ is sensitized by Nd3+, and the intensity ratio of 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 (Nd3+, 1060 nm) and 4F5/2 → 2F7/2 (Yb3+, 980 nm) followed a linear relationship with the temperature in the physiological range (293–313 K), indicating potential application in biomedical diagnosis. Similarly, the sensitivity of mixed Nd3+ and Yb3+ based thermometers can be improved by adjusting the energy transfer efficiency between Nd3+ and Yb3+ ions. Thus another two NIR luminescent MOFs, Nd0.866Yb0.134BTB (BTB = 1,3,5-tris(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene)170 and Nd0.676Yb0.324BTC,171 were designed and exhibited better luminescence temperature sensing property.
Although such a mixed-Ln-MOF approach for self-referencing luminescence sensing is very promising, this strategy is limited to the available luminescence emissions of the lanthanide ions. Recently, Qian et al. demonstrated a conceptually different approach for ratiometric luminescent thermometers using the Eu-MOF⊃dye composite.108 The as-synthesized ZJU-88⊃perylene composite exhibited red-emission of Eu3+ at 615 nm and an appended blue emission around 473 nm of perylene dyes when perylene was encapsulated into the pores of ZJU-88. As expected, when the temperature increased from 20 to 80 °C, the intensity of perylene dyes at 473 nm decreased, while that of Eu3+ at 615 nm increased, which may be attributed to the unique energy transfer from perylene molecules to Eu3+ ions. The intensity ratio of Eu3+ at 615 nm and dyes at 473 nm has an excellent linear relationship with the temperature in the range of 20 to 80 °C, and the maximum sensitivity is determined to be 1.28% °C−1 at 20 °C. Carlos et al. utilized the luminescence intensity ratio of Ln3+ and excimer formed by the two ligand biphenyl groups, developing a ratiometric luminescent thermometer operative close to room temperature. In the unique packing crystal [Tb(H5btp)]·2H2O, there are two emission peaks originating from the excimer and the single ligand besides the Tb3+, respectively. As a result, the same MOF material provides two separate temperature data sets.177
Recently, several examples of self-referencing luminescence sensing of small molecules have also been realized by dual-emitting MOFs. Shi et al. reported a mixed-Ln-MOF, Eu0.5Tb1.5(FDA)3 (H2FDA = furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid), as a self-referencing luminescent probe for mixtures of glycol and 1,4-dioxane in a large volume ratio range.179 When the volume ratio of glycol/1,4-dioxane varies from 0 to 1, the luminescence intensities of both Eu3+ and Tb3+ in Eu2(FDA)3 and Tb2(FDA)3 gradually increase. However, the MOF Eu0.5Tb1.5(FDA)3 exhibits a very unusual volume ratio dependent luminescence: the emission intensity of the Tb3+ ions in Eu0.5Tb1.5(FDA)3 decreases, and that of Eu3+ increases as the volume ratio increases (Fig. 16). Wu and coworkers reported another mixed-Ln-MOF, Eu0.35Tb0.65TCM, for probing VOCs.180 Upon immersion in different solvents of benzene, styrene, benzyl alcohol, nitrobenzene, chlorobenzene, aniline, methanol, and DMF for 1 hour, the composite displays solvent-dependent luminescence. Among them, DMF exhibits an enhancing effect for the emission of both Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions, while chlorobenzene presents an enhancing effect for the emission of only Eu3+ ions. These results indicate that the induced VOCs can not only change the energy transfer efficiency from the organic ligand to Eu3+/Tb3+ ions, but also adjust the energy allocation between Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions in the mixed-Ln-MOFs by induced-fit-type host–guest interactions.

4. MOFs for solid-state lighting and information display
The near infinite choices of MPUs have enabled us to synthesize novel MOFs and purposely tune their luminescence properties. As a result, MOFs can be designed to meet the application of solid state lighting materials in different cases. In the past decade, various MOFs have been developed for luminescence tuning, barcode pattern, information encryption, and white light emitting devices. Their tunable luminescence and myriad structures with diverse properties enable the emission wavelengths covering the entire visible spectrum and white light emission from a variety of mechanisms. In these examples, the quantum yield is affected by the energy transfer efficiency from the singlet state to the lowest triplet state of the ligands, as well as from the triplet state of the ligands to the excited energy level of the lanthanide ions, the mostly utilized construction units of lighting materials.38 Thus, the selection of the organic ligands with suitable excited energy levels is of vital importance to achieve high quantum yield. In addition, most of the reported MOFs for white-light-emitting devices utilize the ligand-based emission as one of the primary blue color sources. This implies less energy transfer from the ligand to the lanthanide ions, thus resulting in lower quantum yield. Many researchers have proposed several novel ways to realize solid-state lighting MOF materials in expectation to improve their quantum yield.
4.1 Luminescence tuning
Due to the promising applications in the fields of lasers, optoelectronic devices and light display devices, attentive efforts have been dedicated to fabricating luminescent tunable MOFs under single wavelength excitation. Lanthanide ions, with the forbidden 4f–4f transitions, can emit long-lived narrow and characteristic emissions. Additionally, the similar chemical properties allow mixing and co-doping of different lanthanides in a broad range, resulting in convenient luminescence tuning properties. Thus, lanthanide ions are widely utilized in luminescence tuning. In 2010, Zhang and coworkers reported a Eu1−xTbx-MOF film whose luminescence can be tuned by modifying the ratio of Eu3+ and Tb3+.181 The intensity of three photoluminescence peaks located at 540, 589 and 615 nm is assigned to the 5D4 → 7F5 transition of Tb3+, and 5D0 → 7F1 and 5D0 → 7F2 transition of Eu3+ ions, respectively. Due to the existence of energy transfer between Eu3+ and Tb3+, the luminescence intensity at 540 nm can be tuned by changing the Tb3+/Eu3+ ratio, leading to the color tuning of this MOF film. Introducing more kinds of Ln3+ ions into MOFs may lead to a larger range of color coordinates and brightness tuning, which was reported by Guillou and coworkers.82 By introducing La3+ as dilution ions and changing the Tb3+/Eu3+ ratio, they synthesized a series of mixed-Ln-MOFs, [Tb2xEu2yLa2−2x−2y(bdc)3(H2O)4]. The color of emission can be tuned by modifying the ratio of Tb3+/Eu3+ while the emission brightness can be adjusted by optical dilution with the introduction of La3+. Zhang and coworkers reported another MOF Tb(1,3,5-BTC)(H2O)·3H2O and incorporated different concentrations of Eu3+ ions.182 By changing the doping concentration of Eu3+ ions, the photoluminescence color can be tuned from green to green-yellow, yellow, orange and red-orange. A practical application of color tunable mixed-Ln-MOFs for barcode fabrication was proposed recently.183 The easily controlled color tuning of MOFs meets the demand of barcoded material, such as easy preparation, innumerous encoding combination, high reproducibility and straightforward recognition. Additionally, lanthanide MOFs can also act as a host for incorporation of lanthanide ions, and the luminescence can be tuned by changing the concentration of coordination ions.
Apart from Ln-MOFs, some other porous MOFs encapsulating lanthanide ions can also realize luminescence tuning. Xu and coworkers reported a newly synthesized Zn-based MOF, and introduced lanthanide ions into the pores of the MOF by soaking in DMF solutions of nitrate salts of Eu3+ and Tb3+.184 Upon UV lamp (λ = 365 nm) excitation, the Eu3+/Tb3+ co-doped MOF exhibited the characteristic sharp multiband emissions corresponding to the encapsulated Eu3+ and Tb3+, respectively. Interestingly, the co-doped MOF also showed Eu3+/Tb3+ ratio-tuned intermediate colors, which can be observed with the naked eye. Following the same strategy, a porous Cd(II)-MOF constructed from the heterocycle-bridge ligand 3,5-bis(3-carboxyphenyl)-1,2,4-triazole, 4,4′-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane and Cd(NO3)2 was reported by Dong and coworkers.185 By easily encapsulating and replacing Ln(H2O)83+ species, the Ln(H2O)83+⊂Cd(II)-MOFs exhibit tunable luminescence emission by adjusting the ratio of incorporated Eu(H2O)83+ and Tb(H2O)83+ species.
Xu and coworkers also reported an example utilizing the guest molecule as the photonic unit to tune the luminescence. They synthesized a Zn-MOF by solvent-induced single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation with appropriate cages for encapsulating Alq3 (tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum) molecules.186 Under the 360 nm excitation wavelength, the Alq3 in DMF solution shows a characteristic luminescence emission at 525 nm. Upon introduction into the Zn-MOF, the peak showed blue shift along with increasing MOF amount, which was due to the higher ordered arrangement of Alq3 within MOFs.
4.2 Barcode pattern and information encryption
Barcoded materials have been a considerable focus for bioanalytical science and anti-counterfeiting application. With the luminescent barcoded materials, the anti-forgery can be achieved by monitoring the emission readout. The demand for barcoded materials includes high stability, easy preparation, innumerous encoding combination, high reproducibility and straightforward recognition. The first luminescent MOF barcode was developed by White, Rosi and coworkers, based on mixed-Ln-MOFs that emit several independent NIR signals arising from different lanthanide cations.187 The resultant mixed-Ln-MOFs, ErxYb1−x-PVDC-1 (x = 0.32, 0.58, 0.70 and 0.81, H2PVDC = 4,4′-[(2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-phenylene)di-2,1-ethenediyl]bisbenzoic acid), can be sensitized by the same ligand PVDC. These MOFs displayed sharp signals from both Er3+ (1530 nm) and Yb3+ (980 nm) and the NIR emission intensity of Er3+ and Yb3+ varies linearly with their concentration in the MOF. This features their potential usage as NIR barcodes.
The use of mixed-Ln-MOFs for barcode application was also reported by Su et al. and Yuan et al.183,188 One can design as many code combinations as possible in mix-Ln-MOFs, and the easily controlled color tuning of mix-Ln-MOFs meets the demand of barcoded materials. Yan et al. developed an encoding strategy based on tuning the emission intensity of the Ln3+@MIL-100(In) film via the encapsulation of a screen layer containing different amounts of organic dyes.189 In the presence of the filtered dyes, fluorescein isothiocyanate and methylene blue, the emission intensities of Eu3+/Tb3+@MIL-100(In) decrease due to the reabsorbed light process. Additionally, the filtered emission intensities can be adjusted by altering the loading concentration of the organic dyes, giving rise to distinct ratiometric optical codes.
In 2015, Su et al. reported a single-component homo-metallic Pr-MOF for a dual-channel readable barcode in both visible and NIR region.190 On varying the excitation from 295 to 315 nm, Pr-MOF emits the characteristic f–f transition emissions of Pr3+, while upon excitation from 320 to 340 nm, two additional broad bands covering 400–450 and 450–600 nm appear, owing to the intraligand charge transfer from the ligand. With the steadily changing excitation wavelength from 290 to 355 nm, the intensity of the ligand-based emission increased, while the Pr3+ based emission decreased. Based on this emission-excitation variation dependence, an encoding strategy can be easily established.
A single material, obtained by grafting Ln3+-β-diketonate complexes into the pores of nanosized MOF-253, exhibiting both wavelength- and temperature-dependent luminescence properties, which displays multistage security behavior was reported very recently (Fig. 17).191 Combining Ln(acac)3 (acac = acetylacetone) and MOF-253 afforded 10%Sm,90% Tb@MOF-352_acac, which shows yellow emission assigned to Tb3+ and Sm3+ transitions upon excitation at 302 nm. In contrast, excitation at 365 nm resulted in a broad band with the peak at 530 nm which originates from MOF-253. The temperature dependent luminescence study was carried out on 5%Sm,95%Tb@MOF-253_tfac, and it turned out that a distinguishable color change was observed in a narrow temperature range (280–320 K).

Rodrigues, Junior and coworkers presented an example of MOFs for anti-counterfeiting applications through inkjet printing.192 The luminescent Ln-MOF can be fabricated as “ink” and deposited onto substrates with an off-the-shelf inkjet printer. A piece of paper with text was overprinted with the “ink” by a conventional monochromatic laser printer, which exhibited color images that can only be observed under UV light irradiation.
Xie et al. reported long-lived luminescence in a Rhodamine B (RhB) encapsulated MOF for anti-counterfeiting stamps very recently.193 The green phosphorescence of the parent MOF Cd(m-BDC)(BIM) originates from the m-BDC ligand. Because of the significant spectral overlap between the absorption of RhB and the phosphorescence of the parent MOF, the phosphorescence energy would effectively transfer from the MOF to RhB, leading to long-lived red delayed fluorescence of RhB. Further, they presented an anti-counterfeiting stamp based on this material. As shown in Fig. 18, when excited at 365 nm, the stamp shows red fluorescence emission, which immediately turns into dark orange long-lived luminescence emission after the removal of UV excitation. Such a distinctive spectral fingerprint makes the stamp a highly reliable anti-counterfeiting measure.

4.3 MOF-based white LEDs
The optimum white-light illumination requires a source with the Commission International de l’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates (0.333, 0.333), with the color rendering index (CRI) above 80 and the correlated color temperature (CCT) between 2500 and 6500 K. Currently, most commercially available white LEDs fall into two groups according to their fabrication: (a) those obtained by mixing red, green and blue LEDs, also called multichip white LEDs (MC-WLEDs); (b) phosphor-converted white LEDs (PC-WLEDs).194,195 MC-WLEDs can provide good color-rendering properties, but it is challenging to balance the luminous intensity of individual chips. Therefore, the single-component strategy (PC-WLEDs) is a potential way to overcome such drawbacks, and MOFs can provide an excellent platform by combining trichromatic MPUs (Fig. 19). One of the representative commercially available phosphors is cerium(III)-doped yttrium-aluminum garnet (YAG:Ce), whose quantum yield can be above 90%.196 However, the lack of red light in the spectrum makes narrow spectral widths, leading to low CRI, and the emission intensity is also unstable at high temperature.197 This is one of the reasons that new phosphors are still largely investigated. As discussed before, MOF-based phosphors are very attractive in this field because of the large choice of MPUs. However, incorporating many construction units may also make the energy transfer process within MOFs very complicate, and thus the quantum yield and spectral width of MOF-based white LEDs still need to be improved.198,199
 Fig. 19  Combination of trichromatic MPUs for MOF-based WLEDs. 
Early research in this field is mainly focused on improving the quality of white light emission. In 2009, Guo and coworkers reported a distinct direct white-light-emitting MOF, [Ag(4-cyanobenzoate)]n·H2O.200 Upon excitation of around 350 nm, the emission peaks at 427 and 566 nm are intensity comparable, leading to direct white light. The CIE coordinates of the white-light emission excited by 349 and 350 nm light are approximately (0.33, 0.34) and (0.31, 0.33), and the external quantum yield is 10.86% when excited by 349 nm light. The emission peak at 427 nm for [Ag(4-cyanobenzoate)]n·H2O is similar to that of the pure ligand 4-cyanobenzoate, indicating that this emission peak is attributable to the intraligand π–π* transition of the ligand. The group of low-energy emission peaks can be mainly attributed to metal to ligand transitions according to theoretical calculations.
Ln-MOFs have been widely studied for white-light-emitting phosphors due to the characteristic f–f transitions of lanthanide ions and broad emission bands of organic linkers. Considering that Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions can display strong red and green emissions, respectively, Qian and coworkers reported a two-dimensional Ln-MOF, La2(PDC)3(H2O)5 (ZJU-1, PDC = pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate), which emitted blue (408 nm) light ascribed to the emissive organic PDC linkers.198 When excited at 312 nm, the co-doped ZJU-1:Tb3+,Eu3+ exhibited the characteristic emissions of Tb3+, Eu3+ and PDC ligand simultaneously. With the coexistence of emission at 408, 543, and 614 nm, and the Tb3+/Eu3+ ratio-controlled emission intensity at 543 and 614 nm, the accordingly optimized ratio for white light emission was figured out as ZJU-1:1.0%Tb3+,2.0%Eu3+ and ZJU-1:1.5%Tb3+,2.0%Eu3+. These two materials exhibit white light emission with the CIE coordinate (0.3269, 0.3123) and (0.3109, 0.3332), and the quantum yield is 6.11% and 6.80%, respectively. Recently, Zhang and coworkers reported a near-ultraviolet WLED based on mixed-Ln-MOF. By employing Eu0.045Tb0.955CPOMBA as phosphor, in which the ligand 4,4′-(5-carboxy-1,3-phenylene)bis(oxy)-bis(methylene)dibenzate (CPOMBA), Eu3+ and Tb3+ emit blue, red and green light, respectively, they realized a WLED with a CCT of 5733 K, a CRI of 73.4, and a quantum yield of 14.4%.195 Su and coworkers demonstrated a 4d–4f MOF Eu–Ag-TPyMNTB (TpyMNTB = tris((pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-benzoimidazol-2-ylmethyl)amine) for white light emission synthesized by assembling Ag+ ions into the predesigned luminescent Eu-organic precursors.201 When excited from 310 to 370 nm, the heterometallic MOF exhibited the characteristic Eu3+ sharp emission and a broad emission centered around 510 nm, and thus the white light emission of chromaticity coordinates ranging from (0.42, 0.32) to (0.45, 0.37) was observed. It is notable that the parent Eu-MOF only shows the characteristic emission of Eu3+, indicating the complete energy transfer from the ligand to Eu3+ and the resensitization of the ligand with the introduction of Ag+ ions.
Taking advantage of the tunable cavities and high porosity of MOFs, high quality white-light-emitting phosphors can also be achieved by incorporating luminescent guest species within the pores of luminescent MOFs. Nenoff et al. reported the broad-band direct white-light-emission originating from a single component MOF, SMOF-1,202 which was synthesized based on indium ions, H3BTB, and ox, namely [In3(BTB)2(ox)3]n. In order to improve the intrinsic color properties such as color rendering index, correlated color temperature, and chromaticity to approach the requirements for solid-state lighting, Nenoff and coworkers doped Eu3+ ions into this system by mixing a Eu3+ metal source into the reaction solution of the indium framework. By increasing the Eu3+ concentration to 10%, the CRI and CCT shifted closer to the set target of CRI ∼ 90 and CCT ∼ 3200 K. When the sample is excited at 350, 360, 380, and 394 nm, the coordinates are (0.369, 0.301), (0.309, 0.298), (0.285, 0.309), and (0.304, 0.343), respectively, which are close to the targeted values. The quantum yield was found to be 4.3% when excited at 330 nm.
Besides the lanthanide MOFs, the lanthanide-free MOF phosphors have been developed for the application of WLEDs.194 Traditional organic phosphors suffer from lower thermal instability and quantum yields compared to the lanthanide phosphors.203 Because the ligands in MOFs can be modified, incorporating organic chromophores into MOFs may address these challenges. Xu and coworkers attached CH3SCH2CH2S- and (S)-CH3(OH)CHCH2S-(2-hydroxylpropyl) to the 2,5-positions of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, and the resultant molecules, named L1 and L2, were synthesized into MOFs with the Pb2+ ion.204 Under UV radiation, the Pb-L1 and Pb-L2 exhibited white luminescence and yellowish green emission, respectively. Photoluminescence spectra demonstrated that they both exhibited emission peaks of ligands at 468 and 459 nm. Besides, Pb-L1 also exhibited a broad emission band at 531 nm ascribed to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), resulting in an overall emission color of yellowish green. However, the LMCT emission intensity of Pb-L2 was weaker than that of Pb-L1 but leaving a “fat” tail spreading well into the red region beyond 600 nm, leading to overall white light emission.
Although several lanthanide MOFs have been demonstrated for WLEDs, the available luminescence wavelengths of these mixed lanthanide MOFs are almost fixed due to the limitation of types of lanthanide ions. In addition, most of them exhibit an unsatisfactory high CCT and low CRI. Qian, Cui et al. developed a new strategy to achieve warm-white LEDs with high CRI by encapsulating cationic dyes DSM (4-(p-dimethylaminostyryl)-1-methylpyridinium) and AF (Acriflavine), which exhibit red-light and green-light emission respectively, into a blue emitting anionic MOF ZJU-28 to yield the MOF⊃dye composite (Fig. 20a).205 The emission color of the obtained composite ZJU-28⊃DSM/AF can be easily modulated by simply adjusting the amount and component of dyes. The confinement of the organic fluorescence dyes within the pores of MOFs not only provided a fine tuning of emission color, but also efficiently enhanced the fluorescence quantum efficiency by blocking the aggregation-caused quenching process of the dyes. With careful adjustment of the relative concentration of the dyes DSM and AF, the resultant ZJU-28⊃DSM/AF (0.02 wt% DSM, 0.06 wt% AF) exhibits a broadband white emission with ideal CIE coordinates of (0.34, 0.32) (Fig. 20b), a high CRI value of 91, a moderate CCT value of 5327 K, and a high quantum yield of 17.4%. On the basis of this research, Wu et al. reported a framework HSB-W1 which incorporated three dyes, realizing high-quality white light emission.206 The blue-emitting dyes fluorescent brightener CBS-127, CBS-X and KSN, green-emitting dyes coumarin derivatives (Coumarin 6, C6; 7-(diethylamino)-3-(2-thienyl)coumarin, C6a; etc.), and red-emitting dyes DSM and 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(p-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran (DCM) can be easily introduced into HSB-W1, resulting in four white-light-emitting MOFs, HSB-W1⊃DCM/C6/CBS-127, HSB-W1⊃DCM/C6a/CBS-127, HSB-W1⊃DSM/C6/CBS-127 and HSB-W1⊃DSM/C6/KSN (Fig. 20c and d).

For a solid emitter, quantum yield is one of the crucial parameters, which should be considered when designing MOFs. Considering that the IrIII complexes are famous for their high PL (photoluminescence) efficiency and relatively short lifetimes,207 Li and coworkers selected [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ (ppy = 2-phenylpyridine) as a yellow-emitting guest species and incorporated it into the blue-emitting MOF Cd-TATPT (TATPT = 2,4,6-tris(2,5-dicarboxylphenylamino)-1,3,5-triazine), as shown in Fig. 21.208 At a concentration of 3.5 wt% of the Ir complex, the resultant material shows CIE coordinates (0.31, 0.33) that are very close to those of pure white light and good color quality (CRI ∼ 80 and CCT ∼ 5900 K). In addition, this material has a high quantum yield of 20.4%. Moreover, the white-light-emitting device was fabricated by coating 3.8 wt% [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+@MOF on a commercially available InGaAsN chip (370 nm), and the device yielded CIE, CRI and CCT of (0.30, 0.35), 84.5 and 5409 K, respectively. In 2016, this group constructed highly luminescent MOFs by using chromophoric ligands.194 The as-synthesized and activated LMOF-1 exhibited a very high internal quantum yield of 95.1% under 365 nm excitation, which is comparable to that of the phosphor YAG:Ce.

Another method for improving the quantum yield of MOF-based white LEDs was reported by Li and coworkers.209 Firstly, they synthesized a new MOF by combining a highly emissive fluorophore ligand TPPE with a bandgap regulating mixed-ligand BTC, and thus the HOMO–LUMO energy gap of MOF could be adjusted, leading to a MOF based yellow phosphor. Secondly, the obtained phosphor was coated on a blue LED chip and could be effectively excited. The as-achieved white light devices exhibited impressive high internal quantum yield with a value as high as 90.7%. This work points to a novel way for significantly improving the quantum yield of MOF-based WLEDs through the bandgap modulation approach, which should be further investigated.
There are two steps of energy conversion in the phosphor-based LEDs, including the transformation of electrical energy into photons and the light generation, thus resulting in much energy loss. Although a clear majority of MOFs are insulators, a few semiconducting frameworks have been reported and suggested intriguing potential in electronic and optoelectronic devices, which has been well summarized by Allendorf et al.210 Very recently, Chen and coworkers firstly reported an electrically driven WLED using MOF material, presenting a major discovery which is very timely for developing solid-state lighting.211 As shown in Fig. 22, the Sr-MOF compound was coated on a 140 nm thick ZnO film on the top of the Si/SiO2/Ag substrate, and a single-layer graphene was used as the top electrode. The device showed electrically driven WLED with a CIE coordinate value close to (0.333, 0.333), a CCT value of ∼5400 K and a quantum yield of ∼10%. The deconvoluted photoluminescence spectra are shown in Fig. 22c; the sharp peaks belong to the several interatomic transitions of Sr and the peak centred at 435 nm belongs to the emission of the ligand. The broad peaks centred at 507 and 642 nm are assigned to the intermetallic energy states, while the emission centred at 568 nm may be due to intersystem charge transfer, which was demonstrated by electroluminescence results and time resolved photoluminescence.

5. MOFs for photocatalysis
Exploring alternative energy sources has been a pressing challenge due to the dwindling fossil fuel supplies and increasing energy demand of human beings. Solar energy is considered as the most promising alternative energy source with its unlimited energy influx.212 Solar energy can be transformed into chemical fuels through green plants via photosynthesis. Inspired by this, scientists have developed various systems and devices to achieve artificial similar photochemical reactions.213 Fujishima and Honda reported the first example of artificial photosynthesis in 1972 using TiO2 to achieve water splitting.214 Henceforth, a large number of different systems and materials have been developed for artificial photocatalysis; yet low transformation efficiency still remains a great challenge in solar energy utilization.
As inorganic–organic hybrid porous materials, MOFs can contain catalytic centers and photosensitizers in a single crystal due to the unique feature of MPUs.215 In the last decade, many MOFs have been proved to be semiconductors.216,217 Moreover, the porous structure of MOFs can also provide sufficient area for chemical reaction or serve as a template to form porous catalysts which can theoretically improve the efficiency of photochemical reactions.218–222 Thus, utilizing MOFs in light-driven chemical reactions is very promising in the field of photocatalysis.
5.1 Hydrogen evolution reaction
Hydrogen is considered as the alternative fuel energy in future due to its abundant reserves and non-polluting reaction products. Solar-driven water splitting to generate hydrogen is a convenient and green way to convert solar energy into chemical energy.223 During the past decade, many examples of MOFs have been reported for light-driven hydrogen evolution reaction.213 In early research studies, MOFs usually acted as an activity site and provided sufficient reaction space for the photocatalytic process. For example, Mori and coworkers reported the first porous MOF [Ru2(p-BDC)2]n for the visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution in the presence of Ru(bpy)32+, N,N′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium (MV2+), and Na2EDTA.224 In this system, Na2EDTA acts as a sacrificial agent, Ru(bpy)32+ as a photosensitizer, and MV2+ as an electron relay. Lin, Zhang and coworkers encapsulated proton reduction catalysts polyoxometalates into MIL-101, and the resulting materials showed excellent photocatalytic proton reduction efficiency in the presence of photosensitizer Ru(bpy)32+.225 Encapsulating polyoxometalates into MIL-101 not only arranges them uniformly in the 3D matrix, but also allows the photosensitizer to surround around polyoxometalates to make the electron transfer process more effective.
MOFs can be used as light harvesting materials through the design of ligands.226,227 Rosseinsky et al. synthesized H2TCPP[AlOH]2(DMF3(H2O)2) (H2TCPP = tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)-porphyrin) with porphyrin and formed the MOF/MV2+/EDTA/Pt system which realized hydrogen evolution. Herein, the porphyrin acts as a photosensitizer and the generated electron is transferred to Pt with the mediation of MV2+ which performs H2 evolution. Lin and coworkers reported another similar visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution system utilizing photoactive MOFs.228 By doping bis(4-phenyl-2-pyridine)(5,5′-dicarboxyl-2,2′-bipyridine)iridium(III) chloride into the UiO-67 framework, they prepared Zr6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(biphenyldicarboxylate)5.94(bis(4-phenyl-2-pyridine)-(5,5′-dicarboxylate)-2,2′-bipyridine)-iridium(III) chloride)0.06 (1). The UiO-framework, 2, was synthesized with the bis(4-phenyl-2-pyridine)(5,5′-di(4-phenylcarboxylate)-2,2′-bipyridine)-iridium(III) chloride ligand and Zr6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(carboxylate)12 SBU. They loaded the Pt nanoparticles in the cavities of these two MOFs by in situ photoreduction of K2PtCl4. Compared to Pt@1, the Pt loading amount is higher in Pt@2 due to its larger cavity. In this system, light is harvested by the Ir phosphors and then the electrons can be transferred to the Pt nanoparticles for reduction reaction (Fig. 23a). Under optimized conditions, Pt@1 and Pt@2 exhibit total hydrogen evolution turnover number of 3400 and 7000 based on Ir phosphors, respectively. Jiang et al. opened an avenue to the synthesis of single metal atoms confined by MOFs for photocatalytic hydrogen production.229 As shown in Fig. 23b, they synthesized a highly stable 3D MOF Al-TCPP using the porphyrin linker, and encapsulated Pt(II) metalation into the porphyrin centers. Following a simple reduction, single Pt atoms were strongly confined by pyrrolic N atoms in the Al-TCPP, resulting in Al-TCPP-Pt. Due to the maximized atomic efficiency, singlet Pt atoms can provide highly efficient electron transfer channels, hence boost the photocatalytic activity. As a result, the Al-TCPP-Pt exhibited a turnover frequency of 35 h−1, about 30 times that of Pt nanoparticles encapsulated in the same MOF.

MOFs as cocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction are also reported recently.230 Huang and coworkers utilized an advanced spectroscopic technique to study the ZIF-67/Ru(bpy)32+ system at the molecular level as photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction. The time-resolved optical measurement reveals that the electron transfer pathway between the photosensitizer Ru(bpy)32+ and ZIF-67 is the key factor that controls the photocatalytic efficiency. In situ X-ray-absorption spectroscopy demonstrated the key intermediate species CoII–H, which provides new insights for further development of ZIF photocatalysts.
Although many MOF-based visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution systems have been discovered, the use of noble metals and low hydrogen evolution efficiency restricted their industrial application. Gascon and coworkers reported a robust heterogeneous composite Co@MOF which is a recyclable and noble metal-free catalyst for visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution.231 They encapsulated the well-defined molecular electrocatalyst CoIIIBr2L9 (L9 = N2,N2′-propanediylbis(2,3-butanedione)2-imine-3-oxime) within the pores of the photoactive MOF NH2-MIL-125(Ti) through the “ship-in-the-bottle” strategy. Compared to the parent framework, NH2-MIL-125(Ti), the composite Co@MOF showed a 20-fold enhancement in hydrogen evolution, exhibiting the best performance among the MOF-based visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution systems reported till then.
Realizing highly integrated and highly efficient materials for light-driven hydrogen generation is one of the directions of MOF-based photocatalysis. Du et al. reported an example of a photocatalytic system for hydrogen evolution without additional cocatalysts and photosensitizers: Cu-I-bpy, with an average rate of hydrogen production of 7.09 mmol g−1 h−1, which is comparable to that achieved with TiO2 standard catalysts.232 This MOF is constructed from the Cu2I2 cluster and the bpy ligand with a band gap of 2.00 eV. As shown in Fig. 24, when light is absorbed by the CuI halide in the MOF, excited photoelectrons are formed and then Cu0 centers are formed from the transfer of electrons from TEA (triethanolamine). Subsequently, the protons gathered on the MOF surface are transferred to unsaturated Cu0 by water, affording CuI hydride species, and then react with the photoelectrons to produce hydrogen. This work provides new insights into the design of d10-based MOFs for photocatalysis in future. Huang and coworkers reported an Al-based MOF with 2-aminoterephthalic acid (H2ATA) as ligand, incorporating Ni2+ cations, which is a photocatalyst for overall water splitting.233 In this system, Ni2+ cations coordinated to the amino group of ATA2− act as the H2 evolution site while the O2 evolution was carried out at the benzene ring of the ligand.

The efficient separation of the mixed H2 and O2 products plays a vital role in photocatalytic water splitting. To address this issue, Jiang and coworkers demonstrated a novel strategy by coupling the H2-producing half reaction with value-added benzylamine oxidation reaction using the MOF composite Pt/PCN-777 (Fig. 25).234 Upon MOF photoexcitation, the electrons rapidly reduce the protons to generate H2 and the holes promote considerable benzylamine oxidation to N-benzylbenzaldimine. Compared with MOF-808, PCN-777 shows much higher activity in the coupled reactions although it exhibits the same structural topology and a very similar coordination environment as MOF-808. The calculation results and characterization tests indicate that the elongated conjugated ligand in PCN-777 extends the light absorption and greatly improves charge separation, thus improving catalytic efficiency.

By synergistically utilizing the plasmonic effect and a Schottky junction to extend the visible light absorption of MOFs and promote charge separation for efficient photocatalysis, Jiang et al. dispersed the Pt NPs as electron acceptors into or supported on a MOF, MIL-125, to afford Pt@MIL-125 and Pt/MIL-125, respectively. Then, the plasmonic Au nanorods (NRs), with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) excitation in the visible region, were assembled onto Pt@MIL-125, Pt/MIL-125, and pure MIL-125, respectively, to give Pt@MIL-125/Au, Pt/MIL-125/Au, and MIL-125/Au (Fig. 26).235 The resultant MOF composite Pt@MIL-125/Au exhibits exponentially enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation, compared with MIL-125/Au, Pt/MIL-125/Au, and other counterparts with similar Pt or Au Contents. This demonstrates the important role of each component and the Pt location in the catalyst.

5.2 Carbon dioxide reduction
Photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction is regarded as the best way to alleviate global warming and energy shortage. Taking advantage of the large surface area, designable structure, and excellent ability of capturing CO2, MOFs may play various roles in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, including as hosts, cocatalysts and catalysts, as illustrated in Fig. 27. For example, Wang and coworkers reported a semiconductor MOF nanocomposite by growing ZIF-8 nanoparticles on Zn2GeO4.236 This system combines the outstanding CO2 adsorption property of ZIF-8 and the actively researched semiconductor photocatalyst Zn2GeO4, leading to much higher photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the aqueous system, compared to the bare Zn2GeO4 nanorods.

MOFs as cocatalysts in CO2 reduction systems have also been reported.237 A noble-metal-free semiconductor photocatalyst graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was merged with the cobalt-containing zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co-ZIF-9). In situ photoluminescence measurements of the reaction systems elucidated that the presence of Co-ZIF-9 can obstruct the recombination of light-induced electrons and holes, indicating that Co-ZIF-9 acts as a cocatalyst besides capturing CO2. Xiong and coworkers utilized HKUST-1 as a platform to construct the Cu3(BTC)2@TiO2 core–shell structure gaseous photocatalyst.238 The obtained core-shell structure retains the CO2 capture ability of HKUST-1 and the gaseous photocatalytic ability of TiO2. Moreover, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction in this system takes place on the Cu sites of HKUST-1 since CO2 is adsorbed on the Cu site and the generated electrons are transferred to HKUST-1, as demonstrated by ultrafast spectroscopy. Taking advantage of the higher selectivity for CO2 reduction of the Cu site compared to the TiO2 surface, together with the improved adsorption of CO2, the Cu3(BTC)2@TiO2 core–shell structure exhibits an outstanding CO2 photocatalytic reduction ability.
As a well-studied photocatalytic element, titanium compound-based photocatalysts were largely reported.239,240 Among them, the targeted photoactive catalyst NH2-MIL-125(Ti) for CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation was firstly reported by Li and coworkers.241 With triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial agent in MeCN solution, HCOO− was detected in the liquid phase under the irradiation of visible light in the presence of NH2-MIL-125(Ti), and an isotope-labelling method demonstrated that the HCOO− was transferred by CO2. Interestingly, the color of the NH2-MIL-125(Ti)/TEOA/MeCN system turned from original bright yellow to green when irradiated by visible light in a N2 atmosphere, which can be gradually changed back to bright yellow with the introduction of CO2 or O2. The photochromic phenomenon helps to reveal the mechanism of CO2 reduction with NH2-MIL-125(Ti): similar to photoexcited metal oxide semiconductors, upon irradiation, the generated electrons are transferred from the organic ligand to Ti4+, and thus Ti4+ is reduced to Ti3+ with TEOA as an electron donor, then the introduced CO2 or O2 is reduced by Ti3+. In 2014, this group further incorporated the noble metals Pt and Au into NH2-MIL-125(Ti), finding that both formate and hydrogen were formed over Pt- and Au-loaded NH2-MIL-125(Ti).242 Compared to the pure NH2-MIL-125(Ti), the formation of formate is 16% lower over Au/NH2-MIL-125(Ti), while Pt/NH2-MIL-125(Ti) exhibits 21% higher formation. With the introduction of noble metal nanoparticles, the electrons from the excited organic linker are also delivered to noble metals for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, resulting in a decrease in the efficiency of CO2 reduction, which is observed over Au/NH2-MIL-125(Ti). However, for Pt/NH2-MIL-125(Ti), the generated hydrogen can spill over to the bridging oxygen near the Ti–O oxoclusters and help the reduction of Ti4+, leading to the higher CO2 reduction efficiency.
Cohen et al. reported a mixed-UiO-66 (Zr4.3Ti1.7O4(OH)4(C8H7O4N)5.17(C8H8O4N2)0.83), synthesized by post-synthetic exchange, for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.243 Compared to the parent framework NH2-UiO-66(Zr/Ti), the turnover number value of (Zr4.3Ti1.7O4(OH)4(C8H7O4N)5.17(C8H8O4N2)0.83) calculated based on Ti content shows 34% increase, indicating that the mixed ligands can improve the CO2 reduction efficiency. UV light photo-electron spectroscopy results show that (Zr4.3Ti1.7O4(OH)4(C8H7O4N)5.17(C8H8O4N2)0.83) has two different valence bands which expands the wavelength range of light absorption, while NH2-UiO-66(Zr/Ti) has only a single valence band, explaining the significant enhancement of the CO2 reduction efficiency. No reaction product was detected when NH2-UiO-66(Zr) acted as a photocatalyst, indicating that Ti played a crucial role in photocatalytic activity. This mixed-metal and mixed-ligand approach opens the door for developing efficient photocatalysts.
Utilizing the superior water-stability of Zr-based MOFs, Jiang and coworkers reported a robust MOF PCN-222 as visible-light photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.244 PCN-222 with dramatic CO2 adsorption ability was constructed based on the catalytic Zr6 clusters and H2TCPP, in which H2TCPP can act as a visible-light-harvesting unit. In the presence of TEOA as a sacrificial agent, the amount of CO2 reduction product HCOO− increased to 30 μmol in 10 h, which was much higher than that of MIL-125-NH2 and UiO-66-NH2 under similar conditions. In contrast, when PCN-222 was replaced by H2TCPP, only 2.4 μmol HCOO− was produced after 10 h. To explain the remarkable enhancement of the CO2 photocatalytic efficiency of PCN-222, the authors resorted to transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy and PL measurements. Based on the TA and PL results, the PCN-222 has two shallow depth trap and one deep depth trap states located very close to the conduction band bottom, contributing to the accumulation of long-lived, photogenerated electrons for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 captured by PCN-222.
5.3 Degradation of organic compounds
With the development of industries, increasing amounts of wastewater containing toxic organic compounds are generated and discharged without further treatment, which have caused severe environmental problems.245 Unfortunately, the current industrial wastewater treatment approaches such as adsorption or separation methods do not degrade the toxic organic compounds into environmentally friendly compounds. Thus many researchers have focused on developing novel photocatalysts for degradation of organic compounds. Considering the practical application, many water stable MOF-based photocatalysts such as MIL-53, MIL-88, MIL-100, MIL-101 and NTU-9 are developed.
Garcia and coworkers reported the first example of photocatalyst MOF-5 for degradation of organic compounds under the irradiation of UV light.246 Encouraged by this work, Chen and coworkers reported a doubly interpenetrated semiconducting MOF, UTSA-38, which exhibited photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solution.247 The MO was gradually degraded into colorless small molecules under the irradiation of visible light by this compound. It retained the photocatalytic property after seven cycles, indicating the good stability during the catalytic process. Moreover, the UV-visible light irradiation can accelerate the degradation of MO. Upon irradiation of UV-visible light, the electrons (e−) are excited to the conduction band, leaving the holes (h+) in the valence band. Then the electrons migrate to the surface of UTSA-38 and reduce the oxygen (O2) finally into hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), while the holes oxidize the hydroxyl groups (H2O) to hydroxyl radicals (˙OH). The generated hydroxyl radicals can decompose MO effectively.
In 2014, Zhang and coworkers reported a p-type Ti-based MOF for use as a visible light photocatalyst for RhB and MB degradation.248 The newly synthesized MOF, NTU-9, with an energy band gap of 1.74 eV, was constructed from Ti as metal nodes and H4DOBDC as the ligand. Ti-Containing compounds are usually good photocatalysts. Combined with the excellent stability of Ti-based MOFs, it is promising to be utilized as a photocatalyst. With the inclusion of NTU-9 in the RhB and MB aqueous solution, the degradation of RhB and MB was complete in 80 min and 20 min under visible light irradiation, respectively. Another MOF, [CuICuII2(DCTP)2]NO3·1.5DMF (DCTP = 4′-(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)-4,2′:6′,4′′-terpyridine), which shows semiconducting behavior, was reported by Cheng and coworkers.249 Through the local density of states and partial density of states analysis, the valance band is mainly composed of Cu 3d orbitals and the conduction band is composed of 2p orbitals of C and N. When this compound is subjected to solar irradiation, the electrons on CuI jump to the neighboring C and N atoms, making CuI the active point to provide holes and its neighboring C and N atoms as the sites to accept electrons. The catalytic property of [CuICuII2(DCTP)2]NO3·1.5DMF in the decomposition of organic compounds was studied in an aqueous solution containing 10 mg L−1 MB, and 70% of MB was decomposed without visible light, while up to 80% MB could be decomposed under visible light irradiation. In the former case, CuII ions in [CuICuII2(DCTP)2]NO3·1.5DMF play a crucial catalytic role in decomposing MB, which was studied in former research studies.250 Meanwhile, the degradation of MB was enhanced under visible light irradiation due to the cooperative decomposition achieved by CuI entities.
Roeffaers and coworkers reported a group of visible light photocatalysts containing robust Fe3-μ3-oxo clusters for degradation of R6G.251 They studied a series of Fe-based compounds, including MIL-100(Fe), MIL-101(Fe), MIL-88B(Fe), amino-substituted MIL-88B-(Fe), and commercially obtained Fe-MOF, Basolite F300. For comparison, commercial titanium dioxide photocatalyst P25, Fe2O3 nanopowder and an as-synthesized amorphous gel Fe(III)-amino with a similar composition as amino-substituted MIL-101(Fe) were also studied. Most of the Fe(III)-based MOFs exhibited remarkably high visible light photocatalytic activity compared to P25 and Fe2O3. Among all the Fe(III)-based MOFs, MIL-88B(Fe) showed the highest visible light photocatalytic activity, indicating that Fe3-μ3-oxo is responsible for the photocatalytic activity since the linker does not absorb any visible light. Although constructed from the same Fe3-μ3-oxo SBU, MIL-100(Fe) and Basolite F300 exhibited lower photocatalytic activity, which means that differences in crystallinity and linker can also affect the photocatalytic activity. The amino-substituted MIL-88B(Fe) and amino-substituted MIL-101(Fe) did not display higher photocatalytic activity compared to the parent MOFs though the substituted linker can absorb a higher amount of visible light, indicating that the visible light absorption of linkers is not directly related to the photocatalytic activity. Moreover, comparison of the photocatalytic activity of Fe(III)-amino gel and amino-substituted MIL-101(Fe) showed that the crystallinity is not a key factor for iron(III)-based photocatalysts. However, further studies are needed for revealing the photochemical mechanisms in iron(III)-based photocatalysts and the key parameters controlling their photocatalytic activity.
Development of heterojunction structures may boost the photocatalytic performance of MOFs, as reported by Wu et al. and Jiang et al.252,253 Wu's group introduced graphene oxide (GO) on the surface of MIL-88A(Fe) nanorods, affording M88/GO-9, which exhibited an 8.4 times higher photocatalytic degradation rate for RhB in the presence of H2O2 compared to that of pure MIL-88A(Fe).252 As shown in Fig. 28a, under visible light irradiation, this compound can be excited to generate electrons and holes. The holes can oxidize RhB directly while electrons can migrate to the GO to produce ˙OH radicals with H2O2 and ˙O2− radicals with O2. Meanwhile, the Fe(III)–O clusters can catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 to produce ˙OH radicals by the Fenton-like reaction. The produced ˙O2− and ˙OH radicals can oxidize RhB, which largely improved the photocatalytic efficiency of M88/GO-9. Jiang's group anchored the Ag/AgCl nanoparticles on the surfaces of MIL-53(Fe) microrods, leading to Ag/AgCl@MIL-53(Fe), showing about 21.4 times higher capacity than that of MIL-53(Fe) for the degradation of RhB.253 In this material, the holes photo-generated from MIL-53(Fe) can directly oxidize RhB. As for Ag/AgCl, the Ag can be surface plasmon resonance excited by visible light and the generated electrons transfer to the CB of AgCl to reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III). Simultaneously, the positively charged species left in the Ag region recombine with the photogenerated electrons from excited MIL-53(Fe) (Fig. 28b). These works could open a new way for exploring heterojunction structured MOFs for photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds.

The kinetic analysis of the photocatalytic system is very important while only a few researchers have focused on this area. Li and coworkers reported three novel MOFs [M(btec)0.5(bimb)]n (M = Co, Ni, and Cd; bimb = 4,4′-bis(1-imidazolyl)biphenyl), obtained by the reaction of dual-ligand btec and bimb with the corresponding metal salts.254 They investigated the kinetic data of three MOFs and P25 for the degradation of an anionic organic dye X3B, finding that it can be well fitted by the first order rate equation, ln(C/C0) = κt, in which C0 and C are the concentration of X3B at exposure time t = 0 and t, and κ is the rate constant, respectively. The rate constant of [Cobtec)0.5(bimb)]n, [Nibtec)0.5(bimb)]n, [Cdbtec)0.5(bimb)]n and P25 is 0.18, 0.19, 0.30 and 0.04 h−1, respectively. The remarkable enhancement of the rate constant for [Cdbtec)0.5(bimb)]n may be ascribed to the lower band gap of [Cdbtec)0.5(bimb)]n and the visible region (476 nm) charge-transfer transition.
For industrial applications, it is necessary to develop a photocatalyst that can be easily separated from a large amount of solution. Jiang and coworkers reported a magnetic metal–organic framework composite Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe) photocatalyst based on MOF material which can be magnetically recycled because of the magnetic core Fe3O4.255,256 Under UV-vis light irradiation, the degradation of MB reached 99% after 40 min in the presence of Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe) and H2O2, showing the synergistic effect of the photocatalytic process. The possible mechanism was proposed wherein the electron was excited from the valence band of MIL-100(Fe) to its conduction band and transferred to H2O2, generating more hydroxyl radicals, which can oxidize the organic molecules. Besides, the magnetic particles can be attracted towards the magnet within 5 s, demonstrating the convenient separation of this photocatalyst from liquids.
5.4 Organic transformation
MOFs are promising candidates for catalytic organic transformation due to the tunable size of pores and various functional sites, which can improve the selectivity to some reactions.219,257 For example, Tang and coworkers recently reported a sandwich MIL-101@Pt@MIL-101 nanostructure as catalyst for hydrogenation reactions.219 The synthetic route toward the sandwich structure MIL-101@Pt@MIL-101 is presented in Fig. 29. The MIL-101(Cr) or MIL-101(Fe) cores coated with MIL-101(Fe) shells can selectively catalyze the hydrogenation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde with the MOF serving as an effective selectivity regulator.

In 2011, Lin et al. reported water stable UiO-type MOFs incorporating photonic units [IrIII(ppy)2(dcbpy)]Cl and [RuII(bpy)2(dcbpy)]Cl2 for photochemical aza-Henry reactions, aerobic amine coupling and sulfide photo-oxidation.258 In the presence of air and a common fluorescent lamp (26 W), the Ir(ppy)2(bpy)+-based MOF and Ru(bpy)32+-based MOF exhibited high photocatalytic efficiency for the aza-Henry reaction, with 59% and 86% conversions in 12 h, respectively. A series of control experiments showed that the permanent porosity plays an important role for the MOFs in catalyzing the photo-driven aza-Henry reaction. Moreover, the Ru(bpy)32+-based MOF also showed efficient photocatalysis for aerobic oxidative coupling of primary amines with 46–90% conversions within three hours.
The utilization of the synergistic effect of two catalysts can significantly improve the efficiency of organic transformation. Duan and coworkers incorporated the photoredox catalyst [SiW11O39Ru(H2O)]5− into the pores of a Cu-based MOF and obtained CR-BPY1, achieving CuII–O–W(Ru) bridges for synergistically catalyzing the oxidative coupling C–C bond formation.259 Under the irradiation of a common fluorescent lamp (18 W), the catalysis gave a C–C bond formation yield of 90% when using N-phenyl-tetrahydroisoquinoline and nitromethane as the coupling partners after 24 hours. Importantly, the oxidative coupling C–C bond formation reaction was found to be highly size-dependent, indicating that the photocatalytic process was taking place in the channels of CR-BPY1. Although these MOFs displayed excellent photocatalytic efficiency for organic transformation, the involvement of noble metals such as Ru and Ir seriously restricted their large-scale application. Wu and coworkers reported a 3D porous and noble-metal free MOF of [Zn2(H2O)4SnIV(TPyP)(HCOO)2]·4NO3·DMF·4H2O for phenol and sulfide oxygenations.260 With a mixture of 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene and the MOF in CH2Cl2/MeOH solvent (4:1, v/v), the substrate could be fully oxidized into 5-hydroxynaphthalene-1,4-dione. As for photo-oxygenation of sulfides, the methyl(phenyl) thioether can be converted into the corresponding products with the yields ranging from 93 to >99.9%. Control experiments demonstrated that the SnIV(OH)2TPyP species also showed photocatalytic activity for phenol and sulfide oxygenations under the same condition, but lost photocatalytic activity after several recycles, while the MOF photocatalysts are more recyclable and can be simply recovered by filtration.
By incorporating a triphenylamine photoredox group and the stereoselective organocatalyst L- or D-pyrrolidin-2-ylimidazole (PYI) into a single framework, Duan and coworkers reported two enantiomeric MOFs, Zn-PYI1 and Zn-PYI2, for photocatalyzing the asymmetric α-alkylation of aliphatic aldehydes.261 The pores of the two MOFs showed adsorption ability toward phenylpropylaldehyde or diethyl 2-bromomalonate, the possible substrates for asymmetric α-alkylation, and the decreased luminescence lifetime of diethyl 2-bromomalonate absorbed MOFs indicates the photoinduced electron transfer process from MOFs to diethyl 2-bromomalonate, which contributes to the light-induced α-alkylation of aldehydes. Using phenylpropylaldehyde and diethyl 2-bromomalonate as the coupling partners, along with a common fluorescent lamp (26 W) as the light source, Zn-PYI1 exhibited a high reaction efficiency of 74% in yield and an excellent enantioselectivity of 92%. Zn-PYI2 exhibited similar catalytic activities in the alkylation reaction of aldehydes with diethyl 2-bromomalonate but gave opposite chiral products. A series of control experiments showed that the triphenylamine fragment in the MOFs plays a key role in the photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the incorporation of both photocatalyst and asymmetric organocatalyst into a single MOF can enhance the enantioselection compared to that of simply mixing the MOFs with the chiral adduct, which may be attributed to the restricted movement of the substrates within the MOF and multiple chiral inductions. Such a combination strategy making use of the excellent stereoselectivity, high surface area, easy availability and various construction components of MOFs points to a new way for designing MOF photocatalysts for organic transformation.
By decorating traditional photocatalysts on MOFs one can improve their photocatalytic properties. Wu et al. anchored CdS on the surface of UiO-66(NH2) and the obtained CdS-NH2-UiO-66 nanocomposites can significantly photocatalyze the selective oxidation of alcohols, which may be due to electron transfer from CdS to UiO-66(NH2) and the high specific surface area of the host MOF.262 A similar decorating strategy was reported by Zhu and coworkers recently.263 They fabricated CdS-MIL-100(Fe) and the resulting nanocomposites exhibit excellent photocatalytic activities for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with visible light.
6. MOFs for nonlinear optics
Nonlinear optics (NLO) describes the nonlinear relationship between the induced dielectric polarization P in a material and the incident light field E. When the high-intensity laser light interacts with a material, the induced polarization P can be written as a Taylor series expansion in the electric field component of the light wave E, as P(E) = χ(1)·E + χ(2)·E·E + χ(3)·E·E·E + ⋯(1)where the linear term is responsible for ordinary, low intensity phenomena (linear optics), the quadratic term for second-order phenomena, the cubic term for third-order phenomena, etc.264,265 Since the second-harmonic generation (SHG) was discovered by Franken et al. in 1961,266 NLO has been largely investigated and developed as a cornerstone in the field of photonics, in which photons are utilized for signal transmission, processing, and storage instead of traditional electrons. In general, the NLO effects include frequency doubling or mixing, such as second-harmonic generation, third-harmonic generation, and parametric amplification, the electrooptic effect, nonlinear refraction and multiple-photon absorption. Materials with excellent NLO properties already play a crucial role in a wide range of information technologies with applications from light frequency conversion, optical telecommunications, information processing, to data storage.264,265 Up to now, various classes of NLO materials have been studied, such as inorganic materials and organic materials.265 MOFs have emerged as promising NLO materials due to their MPU feature, which can not only inherit the high NLO properties of the organic linkers but also give rise to the metal-to-ligand charge transfer transitions. Furthermore, the coordination of organic ligands to metal ions or pore confinement allows the organic chromophores to be arranged in orderly geometries. Thus, MOFs offer many opportunities to meet various NLO applications such as multi-order harmonic generations, multiphoton-pumped emission and data storage.
6.1 Second- and third-harmonic generations
The second-harmonic generation (SHG) and third-harmonic generations (THG) refer to the processes where two and three photons are combined to one with two and three times of the frequency, respectively.267 In order to obtain SHG-active MOF materials, the rational design and synthesis of noncentrosymmetric MOFs is a straightforward strategy. Using asymmetrical or low symmetrical or chiral organic ligands is a simple synthetic approach to construct the noncentrosymmetric MOFs.268,269 Xiong et al. synthesized a chiral ligand H3tzpbin which subsequently reacted with Cd2+ ions to construct a 1D infinite molecular box [Cd(H2tzpbin)2(H2O)2]n (H2tzpbin = trans-2,3-dihydro-2-(4′-pyridyl)-3-(3′′-cyanophenyl)benzo[e]indole), giving a very strong SHG response 80 times that of urea.270 This may be one of the MOFs displaying the strongest SHG response among the chiral ligand based MOFs. The chiral template can induce chirality in the homo-chiral MOFs even when constructed from achiral building components.271 Du et al. synthesized two homo-chiral anionic MOFs constructed from achiral components by using enantiopure L- or D-APA (APA = 2-amino-1-propanol) as chiral inducing agents. Moreover, the ion exchange of counter cations with chiral or polar cationic molecules can enhance the SHG activity of frameworks, which can be utilized to enantioselectively detect chiral alkamines. As for the framework structure, some diamondoid or octupolar as well as a number of 2D grid- or 1D chain-type MOFs display outstanding SHG properties.272 Lin and coworkers carried out the pioneering work in some of these fields. In terms of the 3D diamondoid system, they synthesized a chiral interpenetrated diamondoid MOF sample,273 and varied the length of the building linkers to construct a series of noncentrosymmetric diamondoid MOFs, which exhibit impressive SHG responses ranging from 1.5 to 400 times as large as that of α-quartz.274,275 In the case of 2D grid-type MOFs, they utilized an unsymmetrical linking group and Cd2+ salts to yield a 2D rhombohedral grid [Cd((E)-4-pyv-3-bza)2], which is three-layered-interpenetrated and exhibits ultra-strong SHG activity (1000× α-quartz) compared with the technologically important lithium niobate (LiNbO3, 600× α-quartz).276
Up to now, most of the second-order nonlinear optical MOF materials are constructed from dipolar organic linkers. This traditional strategy usually suffers from unpredictable resulting MOF structures which do not necessarily fulfil the requirement of noncentrosymmetric crystal packing. Different from the approach of directly constructing noncentrosymmetric MOFs, Qian, Cui and coworkers developed a novel approach to construct NLO MOF materials by orderly aligning the pyridinium hemicyanine dyes as photonic units into the 1D channels of the MOF ZJU-28.277 SHG measurements indicate that the NLO intensities of the dye-encapsulated MOFs are heavily dependent on the included guest dyes: the longer the terminal alkyl chains of the included hemicyanine dyes, the stronger the NLO intensity of the resulting MOF materials (Fig. 30). In addition, the DPASD-encapsulated MOFs NOTT-210⊃DPASD (DPASD = 4-(4-(diphenylamino)styryl)-1-dodecylpyridinium) with 3D intersecting channels and bio-MOF-1⊃DPASD with larger 1D pore channels do not exhibit any NLO properties, which is attributed to the poor pore channel confinement for the dye DPASD. These results indicate that exact pore/channel matching with the included MPUs and strong interactions between the host frameworks and the MPUs are important for stabilizing the highly ordered MPUs to generate second order NLO properties.278

More recently, the studies of SHG-active MOFs showed a tendency to theoretically predict second-order NLO properties of MOFs, as well as develop the MOFs with commercial possibility. Seidler and Champagne employed the combined local field theory/charge embedding approach to evaluate the linear and second-order NLO properties of MOFs, which showed qualitative agreement with experimental values.279 van der Veen et al. reported the SHG activity of ZIF-8, one of the most widely investigated MOFs for its thermal and chemical stability, and low manufacturing costs.280 The ZIF-8 with fast synthesis procedures would cause centrosymmetric crystal defects leading to the poor SHG efficiency, while synthesis with slow nucleation displays a high SHG activity which is comparable to that of the commercial crystal potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP).
In contrast to SHG-active MOFs, the investigation of THG-active MOFs remains in its infancy because it is much more difficult to generate high order NLO effects. As for the THG activity, the design and synthesis of non-centrosymmetric structures is no longer a prerequisite and key issue since it belongs to the third-order NLO effect. In contrast, in order to observe the THG response, which is much weaker than SHG response, centrosymmetric structures are preferred to avoid disturbing SHG activity.281,282 Lian et al. reported the third-order NLO properties of two new cobalt(II) MOFs, which are larger than those of C60, phthalocyanine derivatives and semiconductor materials.283 Very recently, Ji et al. reported MOF-1a with bridging ligands possessing significant third-order NLO responses exhibiting efficient THG activity, which is almost three orders of magnitude greater than that of α-quartz (Fig. 31).284 They utilized a photonic ligand trans,trans-9,10-bis(4-pyridylethenyl)anthracene (An2Py) with a symmetrical acceptor–π–donor–π–acceptor structure, which is conductive to enhance its χ(3), χ(5), χ(7) optical nonlinearities. It is also believed that the ordered MOF structure helps to overcome the quenching of optical nonlinearities since it can restrict the intramolecular rotations and aggregation of An2Py. Up to now, the studies of THG activity in MOFs are still very rare, and the explicit mechanism is still unclear. With the development of the laser technology, an elaborate investigation of THG activity must be addressed.

6.2 Multi-photon process
The multi-photon process is a typical phenomenon of non-linear optics in which at least two photons are simultaneously absorbed to pump an electron to an excited state and then drop down to the ground state accompanied with a photon of higher frequency emission.12 Such process can offer stronger spatial confinement, deeper penetration and less Rayleigh scattering, which are very promising for applications in biological imaging, optical data storage, photo-delivery and more.285,286 Recently, Vittal et al. synthesized a MOF exhibiting multiphoton-excited photoluminescence (MEPL) using the NLO active chromophores as ligands.287 Such a MOF can simultaneously absorb up to four photons and the MEPL performance can be further enhanced by loading guest molecules of high quantum yield into the pores of the MOF material. Afterwards, this group systematically studied the structure–property relationship with respect to the two-photon excited fluorescence in MOFs.288 On the basis of three organic dyes, An2Py, trans,trans-9,10-bis(4-pyridylethynyl)anthracene (AnEPy), and 1,4-bis[2-(4′-pyridyl)ethenyl]-benzene (BPEB), and auxiliary ligands, nine Zn-MOFs were synthesized. It was found that the ligand is critical for the two-photon absorption (TPA) cross section of MOFs, and the structural aspect can also affect it. Generally, MOFs constructed from the ligands with higher two-photon absorption cross section also exhibit higher TPA cross section; however, the rotation flexibility and conjugation degree of the ligand within MOFs may influence the nonradiative decay efficiency, changing the two-photon excited fluorescence.
Compared with the MEPL, multiphoton-pumped lasing will require much more prerequisites including a high multiphoton absorption (MPA) cross-section, enough lasing efficiency and a suitable resonant cavity. Qian, Chen et al. demonstrated a new two-photon-pumped lasing by encapsulating the cationic pyridinium hemicyanine dye DMASM with a large TPA cross section into an anionic MOF, bio-MOF-1.117 Because of the pore confinement of DMASM molecules within bio-MOF-1, the dye-encapsulated MOF bio-MOF-1⊃DMASM exhibits a much stronger emission at 610 nm with a fluorescence quantum efficiency of 25.87% than that of the DMASM solution. The high luminescence efficiency and the large TPA cross section of the DMASM dye enable the bio-MOF-1⊃DMASM to generate significant two-photon excited fluorescence and stimulated emission under excitation with a Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm (Fig. 32a and c). More importantly, because the opposing top and bottom faces of the MOF crystals indeed function as two reflectors of a Fabry–Perot cavity and provide strong self-cavity optical confinement and optical feedback, the two-photon-pumped lasing is observed around 640 nm when pumped under a 1064 nm pulse laser with a threshold of 0.148 mJ. This strategy not only combines the crystalline benefit of MOFs and the luminescence behaviour of organic dyes but also creates a new synergistic two-photon-pumped lasing functionality, opening a new perspective for the design of highly efficient two-photon-pumped micro-lasers for integrated photonic circuits.

For the higher-order multiphoton pumped lasing, to obtain the enough optical gain will be more difficult due to the much smaller MPA cross-section and lasing efficiency. It is thus necessary to increase the concentration of the gain medium but without significant luminescence quenching. In addition, in order to efficiently excite the gain medium, the realization of the gain medium alignment/orientation is very important given the fact that the pump light and the multiphoton absorption of the gain medium are usually polarized. Very recently, Qian, Chen et al. reported the first polarized three-photon-pumped lasing in a solid-state microcrystal upon the excitation of 1380 nm.107 As shown in Fig. 32b and d, they synthesized a new anionic MOF ZJU-68, whose pore morphology and size can exactly match that of the dye molecule DMASM. They successfully aligned the DMASM molecules into the 1D channels of ZJU-68 via the in situ self-assembly approach to generate ZJU-68⊃DMASM. ZJU-68⊃DMASM exhibits a relatively high quantum yield of 24.28% with an extremely high dye concentration of more than 0.4 M. Besides the natural crystal facets serving as the resonant cavity and the suitable refraction index, the uniform highly aligned DMASM molecules of high content fulfilled the high-gain lasing with highly polarized excitation response, and showed a perfect polarized emission with degree of polarization (DOP) > 99.9%. Combining both polarization and high-order multiphoton excitation, this material is potentially useful for a new kind of biological imaging due to its ability to reduce multiple scattering, enhance the contrast and improve tissue imaging resolution.
In 2013, Walton et al. reported the first MOF containing a photochromic guest dithienylethene (DTE) with the color changed and reversed upon irradiation of UV and visible light, respectively.289 Such photo-reversible behavior makes the hybrid material a potential candidate in the application of photo-switchable devices and erasable data storage. In these examined systems based on the one-photon triggered reaction process, the spatial selectivity could not be realized because the photochemical responses take place either on the surfaces or in the whole crystals of MOFs. By utilizing the photoactive molecule 2,5-bis(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)-1-methylpyridinium hydroxide as the linker, Qian and coworkers demonstrated a MOF for 3D patterning and two-photon imaging.290 When the single crystals of ZJU-56-0.20 were exposed to a UV lamp at a wavelength of 365 nm, the emission band around 450 nm decreased rapidly, while a new band centered at 550 nm emerged and increased gradually. 1H NMR results indicate that the change of luminescence may be attributed to the nucleophilic addition and subsequent oxidation of the pyridine ring in linkers under UV light irradiation. Similar to the response to UV light illumination, the MOF exhibits a significant two-photon excited fluorescence change in response to an infrared femtosecond laser of 900 nm. This unique two-photon response allows for two photon patterning and imaging in a high-resolution (1 × 1 × 5 μm3) 3D structure (Fig. 33). Because of the irreversible photochemical process, the fluorescence pattern is much more stable and does not show much decay even after 30 days. The incorporation of photoactive linkers to tune the luminescence of MOFs for 3D patterning and two-photon imaging will enable MOFs to be useful materials for sensor arrays and data storage media.

The NLO properties of MOFs depend not only on those of chromophore molecules constituting them, but also on the orientation and morphology of their assemblies. As mentioned before, the ordered confinement of pyridinium hemicyanine chromophores within the pores of MOFs can generate high second-order NLO activity and multiphoton pumped lasing. In addition, the fruitful excited state photophysical properties and energy/charge transfer processes of MPUs enable the realization of novel NLO effects. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the photophysical properties and energy transfer processes is very essential to direct the NLO MOFs design and synthesis. Lin and coworkers investigated the step-by-step random hopping model which is usually used to explain the Dexter mechanism and the Förster mechanism.77,291 They found that singlet exciton migration that occurs in MOFs through the Förster mechanism also involves one-step jumping over a long distance, which cannot be explained by the step-by-step random hopping model. In such a system, the truxene-tribenzoate ligands serve as the antenna array in which excitons move via ligand-to-ligand energy exchange. The coumarin dye molecules within the MOF cavity act as acceptors of energy. Thus the emission ratio between the coumarin dye and ligands corresponds to the exciton migration rates. The exciton diffusivities were found to be 1.8 × 10−2 and 2.3 × 10−2 cm2 s−1 in two as-synthesized MOFs respectively, which demonstrates that exciton jumping beyond nearest neighbors happens in these systems.
Howard, Richards et al. examined the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) based photon upconversion process in a MOF with a three-layer ordered structure.292 Generally, the TTA-based upconversion system comprises a pair of chromophores: sensitizer and annihilator. Upon photoexcitation of a sensitizer, the singlet state sensitizer undergoes intersystem crossing (ISC), giving rise to its triplet state. Then, triplet–triplet annihilation between two excited triplet annihilators generated by triplet–triplet energy transfer eventually creates one excited singlet annihilator. Subsequently, the upconversion luminescence is observed. Howard et al. proposed the three-layer A–B–A structural MOF and fabricated the sensitizer layer “B” using Pd(II) 5,15-diphenyl-10,20-di(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin linkers on top of an emitter layer “A” consisting of 4,4′-(anthracene-9,10-diyl)dibenzoate linkers. The chromophores within the layer B are excited with green (532 nm) photons to generate triplet states in B, which will cross the B–A heterojunction by Dexter electron exchange and be collected in the layer A (Fig. 34). Subsequently, pairs of triplets can decay via TTA-upconversion, emitting higher-energy blue photons. More importantly, with a thicker B layer which can absorb more photons to generate more triplets and a thinner A layer which may improve the triplets’ concentration, the photon unconversion threshold can be tuned to a lower state. These works present an insight into the exciton transfer mechanism in MOFs and pave the way for designing efficient energy transport networks.
 Fig. 34  Schematic diagram of triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) wherein two 532 nm photons absorbed by the sensitizer layer B create triplet states that upon reaching the interface can transfer to the emitter layer A by a Dexter two-electron-exchange mechanism. When two triplets meet in the emitter layer they can annihilate and emit a single higher-energy photon. Reproduced with permission from ref. 292. Copyright 2016 Wiley-VCH. 
To demonstrate the potential of the TTA-based upconversion MOF in in vivo imaging, Zhou et al. incorporated a sensitizer, Pd(II)-meso-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (Pd-TCPP), into a water stable Zr-MOF, which is constructed from an annihilator linker DCDPA (DCDPA = 4,4′-(9,10-anthracenediyl)dibenzoate).293 In this MOF platform (Fig. 35), the well-aligned annihilators facilitate a long-range 3D triplet diffusion of 1.6 μm, thus allowing efficient energy migration. In addition, the tunable ratio between sensitizer and annihilator also allows an optimization of the system for maximized TTA-upconversion efficiency at a very low excitation power density.

A recent example utilizing the parallel and stacked arrangement of linkers to achieve strong nonlinear optical property and stimulated emission was reported by Fischer and coworkers.294 They synthesized two 3D MOFs using an AIE dye H4TCPE as linker and In3+, Zn2+ as nodes. The In-MOF and Zn-MOF materials exhibited unique intrinsic blue stimulated emission with thresholds of 36 and 27 mJ cm−2 upon excitation by a 400 nm laser, respectively, which was attributed to the high packing density and the ordered arrangement of the TCPE linker. Additionally, the strong two-photon excited fluorescence with action cross-section values of 3072 and 1053 GM for In- and Zn-MOF, respectively, is also obtained. These properties are attributed to the conformational rigidity and packing of the organic linkers that are pinned between the metal-ion nodes of the framework, thus demonstrating the possibility to realize novel nonlinear optical and optical gain applications through the controlled and ordered arrangement of ligands within MOFs.
7. MOFs for biomedical photonics
As porous materials, MOFs were initially investigated as hosts for drugs which need to be delayed released in the field of biomedicine.295–297 With the introduction of MPUs into MOFs, such a material exhibits many unexpected applications in photobiology, such as biological imaging, biosensors and photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy.298–300 The ability of flexible design enables MOFs to be compatible with the complicated environment of organisms. Certainly, in order to get into the cells of size 1–10 μm, scale down is one of the essential prerequisites of MOFs for biomedicine, which will be reviewed in this section firstly.301
7.1 Nanoscale MOFs
Recently, scaling down the MOFs has afforded an exciting new class of materials known as nano-MOFs. Compared with other nanomaterials, nanoscale MOFs possess several advantages that make them superior for biological and biomedical applications:302–305 (1) the good crystallinity, structural controllability and post-modification allow nano-MOFs to be rationally designed for specific applications. (2) The periodic and high porosity allows nano-MOFs to achieve high and uniform loadings of imaging/therapeutic agents, minimize the self-quenching effect of dye molecules and quickly diffuse small molecules. (3) The relatively labile metal–ligand bonds make nano-MOFs intrinsically bio-degradable in the long term.
Apart from a few MOFs, such as UiO-66-derivatives, UiO-67-derivatives, MIL-derivatives, ZIF-8, etc., most MOFs need to be scaled down into nano-MOFs to meet the demand of biological applications. In general, nano-MOFs can be synthesized through the following methods:306 nanoprecipitation method, mechanochemical synthesis, solvothermal/microwave-assisted synthesis, sonochemical synthesis, and surfactant-involved synthesis. The first two approaches often can only produce amorphous materials, while the other methods can also afford crystalline materials, due to the better control on nanoscale nucleation and growth kinetics. In addition, the last method includes surfactant-templated synthesis and reverse microemulsion synthesis, requiring surfactants as assistants to control the synthesis process as well as stabilize and disperse the nanoscale particles.
The utilization of the water-in-oil, or reverse, microemulsion method for nano-MOF synthesis has been reported by Lin and coworkers.307 They prepared a nano-MOF Gd(BDC)1.5(H2O)2 by reacting GdCl3 and bis(methylammonium)benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate in the cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)/isooctane/1-hexanol/water system. By varying the w value (defined as the water/surfactant molar ratio) of the microemulsion systems, the morphologies and sizes of the nano-MOF can be tuned. Furthermore, the particle size of nano-MOF is also affected by the reactant concentration and the reactant ratio. The crystalline nanoplates of [Gd(1,2,4-BTC)(H2O)3]·H2O, with a diameter of ∼100 nm and an average thickness of 35 nm, have also been prepared using the reverse microemulsion method. This group also synthesized the nano-MOFs Mn(BDC)(H2O)2 and Mn3(BTC)2(H2O)6 in reverse microemulsions.308 Reacting MnCl2 and [NMeH3]2(BDC) in a CTAB/1-hexanol/n-heptane/water microemulsion with a w value of 5 yielded the nanorods of Mn(BDC)(H2O)2, with a structure corresponding to a known crystalline phase. The nano-MOF of Mn3(BTC)2(H2O)6 can be produced in a CTAB/1-hexanol/isooctane/water microemulsion (w = 10) with a Na3(BTC)/MnCl2 molar ratio of 2:3. The particles of Mn3(BTC)2(H2O)6 are crystalline spiral rods, but do not correspond to any known phase of Mn-BTC-based MOFs. The similar synthesis of nano-MOF Eu2(BDC)3(H2O)2·(H2O)2 by reacting EuCl3 and the methylammonium salt of H2BDC in a CTAB/1-hexanol/isooctane/water microemulsion has been reported by Chen et al.309
Besides the room temperature microemulsion synthesis, the surfactant-assisted synthesis at elevated temperatures has been developed by Lin et al. for the synthesis of nano-MOFs.310 The block-like nanoparticles of Gd2(bhc)(H2O)6 (bhc = benzenehexacarboxylate) were synthesized by heating a CTAB/1-hexanol/n-heptane/water microemulsion containing [NMeH3]6(bhc) and GdCl3 at 120 °C for 18 h. Interestingly, reacting GdCl3 and mellitic acid in the same microemulsion system at 60 °C in a microwave reactor for 15 min afforded the high-aspect ratio nanorods, which have the formula of Gd2(bhc)(H2O)8·2(H2O). Additionally, the surfactant-assisted synthesis under microwave heating is also utilized to produce the Mn-based nano-MOFs, which have been synthesized in reverse microemulsions at room temperature, as mentioned above. Nanorods of Mn(BDC)(H2O)2 synthesized under microwave heating have identical phase and similar morphology to those obtained from the microemulsion, while the particles of Mn3(BTC)2(H2O)6 obtained by the former way have a block-like morphology, with lengths ranging from ∼50 to 300 nm in the three dimensions.308
In 2013, Maspoch and coworkers reported a spray-drying technique that can synthesize nano-MOFs.311 The precursor solution was atomized into a spray of microdroplets through a two-fluid nozzle, which was realized by simultaneously injecting the solution and compressed air or nitrogen. Thus the precursor droplet is suspended and heated by a gas stream to a certain temperature, causing the evaporation of solvent and diffusion of precursors to the droplet surface. With the evaporation of the droplet, the precursor concentrations increase, and the nano-MOFs begin crystallizing at the surface. Carlos and coworkers successfully prepared a lanthanide organic framework as a nanothermometer by this method recently.167
7.2 Biological imaging
Despite enormous progress in our understanding of cancer biology, the survival rate for most cancers has remained unchanged over the past few decades.312 One of the reasons is that many patients are diagnosed at late stages of cancer due to limited current diagnostic techniques. Biological imaging is a technique used in biological sciences to generate scientifically useful images of various aspects of organisms and biological systems that are not visible to the naked eye.297 It is particularly useful for taking images of the brain or for detecting cancer. So far, various nanoparticle platforms have been developed for cancer diagnostics. Nano-MOFs can serve as imaging agents via the introduction of MPUs for optical imaging (OI), paramagnetic metal ions such as Gd3+ and Mn2+ for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and iodinated aromatic ligands/guest molecules or gold nanoparticles for computed tomography (CT).295,297,313 Lin and co-workers carried out many ground-breaking works on nano-MOFs for biomedical imaging.308,314 In 2013, Rosi et al. reported a very important example of NIR-emitting MOF for optical imaging in living cells.178 The nano-MOF Yb-PVDC-3 exhibits Yb3+ luminescence centered at 970 nm and PVDC emission at 445 nm simultaneously upon excitation of the PVDC sensitizer in a 0.1 M Hepes buffer (pH = 7.3) environment. They tested this probe in human cancer and mouse cells in a NIR microscopy experimental setup. As shown in Fig. 36, visible PVDC and NIR Yb3+ emission signals were both observed in the same field and the difference between these two signals results in the discrimination of the NIR signal from the visible autofluorescence arising from the biological material. Besides, the stability and cytotoxicity results show that this MOF is a promising biological probe for in vivo applications.

From the review of articles of the last few years, research studies on nano-MOFs for biomedical imaging show the tendency of multi-functionality and multimodal imaging. Wang et al. synthesized the multifunctional hybrid nanoparticle Fe3O4@PAA/AuNCs/ZIF-8 via a facile, mild and reproducible strategy, which can achieve a tri-modal (OI, MRI and CT) cancer imaging.315 Moreover, this hybrid nanomaterial is not only biocompatible, but also possesses ultra-high doxorubicin loading capability (DOX, 1.54 mg DOX per mg NPs) and dual pH-responsive controlled drug release properties. Using the respective imaging capabilities of Gd-MOFs and gold (Au), Tian et al. reported the integration of Gd-MOF nanoparticles with Au-NPs by making use of poly(acrylic acid) as a cross-linker resulting in a hybrid nanocomposite as a MRI/CT bimodal imaging agent.316 Due to the up-conversion luminescence (UCL) using the longer excitation wavelength, the combination of UCL and MRI in one imaging system may offer deeper tissue penetration, higher photo-stability and a lower optical background. Tang et al. synthesized a nanocomposite material with the combination of a NaYF4:Yb,Er up-conversion nanoparticle (UCNP) core into the Fe-MIL-101-NH2 nano-MOF shell, which can simultaneously display the NIR property of UCNP cores and the T2-MRI property of MOF shells.317 The synthetic route toward biocompatible UMPs is shown in Fig. 37a; moreover, UMPs can be further modified with anti-cancer targeted molecule folic acid (FA), making the post-modified nanocomposite material promising for UCL/MRI dual-mode targeted imaging. Upon excitation with a 980 nm laser diode, UMPs exhibited green and red emission at 520, 540 and 654 nm which was assigned to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 7F9/2 → 7I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively. Additionally, the T2-relaxation time of water protons is shortened from 2047 to 5.6 ms, which is sufficient for in vivo use. When KB tumor cells (human epidermoid carcinoma cells) were incubated with UMP-FAs for 24 h, strong green fluorescence can be observed both inside the cells and surrounding the cell nucleus, indicating that UMP-Fas can be uptaken by KB cells (Fig. 37b). On the other hand, the MRI signal at the bottom of tubes became darker with the increasing concentration of UMP-FAs. The in vivo dual-mode imaging was also evaluated by the authors. As shown in Fig. 37c, an intense UCL signal was observed in the tumor upon 980 nm excitation. The T2-weighted MRI was also conducted and the tumors with UMP-FAs showed an obvious darkening effect (Fig. 37d).

7.3 Biosensing
Luminescent nano-MOFs have become very appealing candidates for measuring the levels of bio-sensing or biochemical compounds, owing to the wide range of selectable MPUs, and various pore/channel structures that can be utilized to tune the optical, adsorbed, and specifically selective properties for the required analysis.318 Lin and coworkers covalently conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) to a UiO-type nano-MOF affording the first nano-MOF example F-UiO for real-time intracellular pH sensing in live cells, with the desired properties of high pH response sensitivity, structural stability, and efficient cellular uptake.319 This study also provided the first insight into the endocytosis and intracellular trafficking process of nano-MOFs, paving the way for further research studies. Very recently, they presented the first example of nano-MOF based intracellular oxygen sensor R-UiO, which is based on the Pt(II)-porphyrin ligand as an O2-sensitive probe and the Rhodamine-B isothiocyanate ligand as an O2-insensitive reference probe, exhibiting excellent phosphorescence/luminescence dual-emission for the ratiometric detection of O2.320
Early diagnosis of virus nucleic acid is very important for quarantine and disease control.321 Chen et al. reported a water stable Cu-based MOF, which can form electrostatic, π-stacking, and/or hydrogen-bonding interactions with carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labelled single-stranded DNA sequences (P-DNA), as an effective turn-on fluorescent sensor for detecting human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) double-stranded DNA and Sudan virus (SUDV) RNA sequences with detection limits of 196 and 73 pM, respectively (Fig. 38).322 The fluorescence of FAM can be quenched by the MOF through the photoinduced electron-transfer process. With the addition of target DNA, P-DNA is released from the MOF and thus the fluorescence intensity of FAM can be recovered. They found that the MOF with bigger pores from flexible zwitterionic carboxylates of low symmetry may provide a possibility to detect longer nucleic acid sequences. More recently, the rise of a very acute virus infection, the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), received a great attention for its high infectivity and high mortality rates. Chen and coworkers constructed a water-stable dysprosium-based MOF containing the probe ss-DNA by non-covalent interactions, serving as a very efficient sensing platform for complementary Ebolavirus RNA sequences with a detection limit of 160 pM.323

In addition, the nano-MOFs as well as their hybrid materials have been reported for use as biosensors in many other fields, such as intracellular ion sensing, small molecule sensing and albumen detection. For example, Liu et al. explored a fluorescent nano-MOF (nMOF-253s) for Fe2+ ion detection in aqueous solution, exhibiting high sensitivity and selectivity, which is also successfully applied in Fe2+ sensing in HeLa cells.324 Chen et al. developed a sensitive chemiluminescence (CL) method for detecting dopamine (DA) by using MOF HKUST-1 as catalyst.325 Due to the facilitated radical generation and electron transfer processes on the surface of HKUST-1, the CL intensity of the luminol–H2O2 system in an alkaline medium can be further enhanced, giving the low DA detection limit down to 2.3 nM.
7.4 Photodynamic therapy
PDT, which uses photosensitizers (PSs) to produce highly cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen (1O2) by light activation, is a promising anti-cancer approach to selectively kill tumor cells via the localized irradiation at tumor sites, and is gradually becoming an alternative to traditional cancer treatments for its minimal invasiveness and low toxicity to normal tissues.326,327 Porphyrin is one of the most utilized photonic units in constructing MOFs for PDT, because its strong absorption in the red region locates in the biologic window and high intersystem crossing probability leads to effective population of the triplet state, coupled with an efficient generation of singlet oxygen.
Lin and coworkers designed the first Hf-porphyrin-based nano-MOF example (DBP-UiO), as a highly efficient PS for the photodynamic therapy of resistant head and neck cancer.328 The DBP-UiO can efficiently generate 1O2 owing to the construction components and the porous morphology: (1) porphyrin-based linkers offer the site isolation of the PS; (2) Hf centers enhance the intersystem crossing; (3) the porous DBP-UiO nanoplates facilitate the diffusion of 1O2. More recently, Lin's group partially reduced the DBP ligand to the ligand 5,15-di(p-benzoato)-chlorin (DBC) and utilized the latter ligand to construct the framework with Hf ions, demonstrating the first chlorin-based nano-MOF DBC-UiO with much improved performance than the previous nano-DBP-UiO.329 Besides possessing the same crystallinity, stability, porosity, and nanoplate morphology as DBP-UiO, the partially reduced DBC ligand in DBC-UiO results in a 13 nm red-shift and an 11-fold increase in the extinction coefficient of the lowest-energy Q band, leading to the much higher PDT cytotoxicity with 1O2 generation 3 times as efficient as that of DBP-UiO. Considering that the X-rays can penetrate deeply into tissue, this group synthesized Ir[bpy(ppy)2]+- or Ru(bpy)32+-derived Hf-MOF, where heavy Hf atoms in the SBUs can efficiently absorb X-rays and transfer energy to Ir[bpy(ppy)2]+- or Ru(bpy)32+ moieties to induce PDT by generating ROS.330 As a result, high 1O2 quantum yield of the compound was realized, and this PDT treatment led to a 90% reduction in tumor volumes.
Zhou et al. focused on the reversible control of 1O2 generation.331 Very recently, they introduced the PS and photochromic (PC) units as building components into the Zr-based nano-MOFs via the in situ synthesis approach, achieving the reversible control of 1O2 generation for PDT to the greatest extent by optimizing the ratio of PS and PC units.332 As shown in Fig. 39a and b, the chemical structure of the switch 1,2-bis(5-(4-carbonxyphenyl)-2-methylthien-3-yl)-cyclopent-1-ene (BCDTE) can be photoisomerized thus tuning the energy level. When the BCDTE switch is in the open state, the energy transfer occurs from the T1 energy level of TCPP to 3O2, leading to 1O2 generation. In contrast, the closed BCDTE can quench 1O2 generation due to the energy transfer to the BCDTE. Furthermore, they evaluated the applicability of this system in live B16 cells. As shown in Fig. 39c–e, the open state sample exhibited remarkable red emission while the closed state sample shows negligible fluorescence, demonstrating that the excited energy of TCPP was not disturbed by the open switch while the closed form of BCDTE turns off the 1O2 generation, as proposed in Fig. 39b. Based on the experimental research, Zhou and co-workers found that the size optimization of nano-MOFs as PSs may play an important role in improving cellular response.333 They successfully tuned the size of PCN-224 nanoparticles into the biologically interesting range of 30–190 nm and eventually found that the 90 nm-PCN-224 possesses the highest PDT efficacy. Moreover, the active targeting modality of the PCN-224 nano-platform for further enhancement of PDT efficacy can be obtained via the post-synthetic FA modification onto the Zr6 cluster. A recent example of H2S triggered nMOF photosensitizer for PDT with controllable 1O2 release was realized by Tang and coworkers.334 The Zn-TCPP was selected as a photosensitive bridging ligand to construct a nMOF with Cu2+, which can significantly minimize the ROS production efficiency of the PS. However, with the appearance of H2S, Cu2+ ions were taken out and the ROS production efficiency recovered, leading to a H2S triggered photosensitizer. These results will promote the design of nano-MOFs at the molecule scale for the specific applications of PDT.

Though porphyrins and derivatives were widely utilized as PSs for PDT, the extinction coefficients of them in the therapeutic window are not very high. The Xie group reported a non-porphyrin-based MOF for PDT.335 In their work, the non-porphyrin PS, BODIPY, which is considered as an ideal PDT agent because of low dark toxicities and high extinction coefficients, was incorporated into UiO-66 through a ligand exchange process. In vitro phototoxicity studies on B16F10 mouse melanoma cells demonstrated high phototoxicity for both UiO-BODIPY and free BODIPY, while UiO-BODIPY showed better photostability.
In addition to focusing on the generation of singlet oxygen, more and more reports concentrate on the synergy of PDT with other treatments based on the multi-functional nano-MOFs. Zhang et al. assembled a dye-labelled peptide, a folate targeting motif and a porphyrin into the cages of a nano-MOF, not only significantly increasing the 1O2 quantum yield of porphyrin by 6.2 times, but also achieving highly efficient cancer therapy and in situ therapeutic monitoring, which exhibited great potential in the integration of cancer diagnosis and treatment.336 Chen et al. reported the first graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, a PDT agent) nanosheet@ZIF-8 core–shell nanoparticles for photo-chemo combination therapy (Fig. 40).337 The combination of chemotherapeutic effects of DOX and the PDT effect of g-C3N4 nanosheets leads to significantly enhanced efficacy. By encapsulating UCNPs and DOX into porphyrin-based nMOFs, Yan et al. firstly realized a MOF for chemotherapy and NIR-induced PDT.338 The absorption spectrum of the porphyrin-based-MOF is overlapped with the emission spectrum of UCNPs over a broad range, enabling the energy transfer between them. As a result, upon excitation at 980 nm, the ROS can be generated. In vivo antitumor activity was investigated in the 4T1 breast tumor-bearing mice. The tumor growth of the Dox/UCMOFs + NIR treated group was completely suppressed, demonstrating the excellent synergistic therapeutic effect of chemotherapy and NIR-induced PDT. Very recently, Liu et al. reported a nano-MOF rationally designed with organic ligand TCPP as a PS to allow PDT and the hafnium (Hf4+) center serving as a radio-sensitizer to enhance radiotherapy (RT).339 These works present a new concept of developing multi-functional nano-MOFs, in which the building components, post-modification and guest molecules can contribute to the therapeutic effect.

Liu et al. reported a strategy for bacterial detection and therapy through the use of MIL-100(Fe) nanoparticles (NPs) as nanocarriers for the precise delivery of 3-azido-D-alanine (D-AzAla).340 In the first step, they synthesized the nanoscale MIL-100(Fe) to load D-AzAla through a simple absorbing process, and then introduced polymer Pluronic F-127 to form D-AzAla@MIL-100(Fe) NPs to improve the dispersity of MOFs in physiological conditions (Fig. 41). After intravenous injection, MIL-100(Fe) NPs can accumulate preferentially and degrade rapidly within the high H2O2 inflammatory environment, releasing D-AzAla in the process. By using ultrasmall 2-(1-(5-(4-(1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)vinyl)phenyl)thiophen-2-yl)ethylidene)malononitrile (US-TPETM) NPs as photosensitizers, a non-antibiotic tool for image-guided antibacterial therapy was achieved. After the successive injection of D-AzAla@MIL-100(Fe) NPs and US-TPETM NPs, followed by white light illumination, the number of bacteria in the infected tissue decreased significantly and the inflammation was successfully relieved.

(b) D-AzAla@MIL-100(Fe) NPs accumulate at the site of the infected tissue and are decomposed in the presence of H2O2. Meanwhile, invading bacteria internalize these released D-AzAla and express the azide group on their cell wall.

7.5 Photothermal therapy
Photothermal therapy (PTT) employs photoabsorbing agents to generate heat from light, especially NIR emission, for thermal ablation of cancer cells, and has attracted wide attention owing to its minimal effect to biological tissue. With the photonic units as photoabsorbers, nano-MOFs can be designed as PTT agents, which is an emerging research topic nowadays.
A pioneering study in this field was reported by Jing and coworkers.341 The hybrid UiO-66@PAN, constructed from UiO-66 and NIR-absorbing polymer polyaniline (PAN), combines the advantages of stability and excellent photothermal activity for the effective photothermal therapy of colon cancers. In vivo experiments were carried out in colon cancer bearing mice. The tumors treated with UiO-66@PAN and NIR irradiation exhibited complete tumor regression compared to the control groups after 10 d, demonstrating the excellent PTT treatment effect. Considering the excellent photothermal stability and high heat generation rate of Au nanorods, they are usually utilized as PTT agents modified with CTAB. Chen and coworkers reported ZIF-8 coated Au nanorods for enhanced photothermal therapy and stability, overcoming the high cytotoxicity and aggregation trend of CTAB coated Au nanorods.342 As a result, through treatment with laser in PBS, the temperature of the sample with ZIF-8 coated Au nanorods sharply increased from 20.0 to 47.6 °C, while the Au nanorods showed much lower photothermal effects.
Combining MRI and PTT, Liu's group fabricated a nano MOF via the self-assembly of Mn2+ and IR825 bridging ligands, which can offer strong MR contrast and high NIR absorbance, respectively.343 The MOF was further modified with polydopamine (PDAM) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), affording Mn-IR825@PDAM-PEG with excellent physiological stability (Fig. 42a). Upon intravenous injection of Mn-IR825@PDAM-PEG, T1-weighted MR signals gradually showed up in the tumor, as shown in Fig. 42b, indicating time-dependent tumor accumulation of the MOF. Additionally, the in vivo PTT efficiency of Mn-IR825@PDAM-PEG was evaluated in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. As shown in Fig. 42c, the temperature of tumors in mice 24 h after intravenous injection with Mn-IR825@PDAM-PEG would rapidly rise from ∼34 to ∼52 °C within 5 min under the irradiation of an 808 nm laser at 0.6 W cm−2, while the control group showed only a ∼4 °C increase under the same condition. This group further incorporated Hf4+ into Mn-IR825@PDAM-PEG through the metal exchange method, affording Mn/Hf-IR825@PDAM-PEG, which demonstrated a strong T1 magnetic resonance contrast, computed tomography signal enhancement ability, radio-sensitization capability and high PTT efficiency.344

Taking advantage of the porous structure of MOFs, realizing photothermal therapy and chemotherapy has attracted a great deal of research attention very recently. Zhang et al. reported core–shell structured nanocomposites with polypyrrole as the core and MIL-100(Fe) as the shell for combined PTT and chemotherapy.345 The polypyrrole core is able to photothermally ablate cancer cells under NIR irradiation as an organic photothermal agent, whereas the MIL-100(Fe) shell can load DOX and show controlled release by low pH. More importantly, it was found that the local heating could promote the release of the drug, which amplifies the treatment effect for cancer. Similarly, by incorporating graphene quantum dots into DOX-loading ZIF-8, Zhu et al. realized synergistic chemotherapy and PTT.346 With breast cancer 4T1 cells as a model cellular system, the results indicated that the combined chemotherapy and PTT exhibited a significant synergistic effect, leading to a higher efficacy to kill cancer cells compared with monotherapy.
Integrating more functions into one material is one of the development directions for biological medicine. Very recently, Chen and coworkers realized a core–shell nanostructure for pH-responsive artemisinin delivery, magnetic resonance and optical dual-model imaging-guided chemo/photothermal combination cancer therapy (Fig. 43a).347 The core–shell structure was obtained by coating the inner core of Prussian Blue (PB) with shell MIL-100(Fe). Due to the existence of –CN– clusters, the inner PB can be used as an OI agent. Besides, the core and shell can serve as T1/T2 and T2 MRI contrast agents, respectively. An in vitro bioimaging study was firstly carried out on human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. After incubation with the PB@MIL-100(Fe) for 24 h, the cells became brightly illuminated with multicolour images when they were excited with 405, 488 and 543 nm single-photon and 750 nm two-photon laser pulses, indicating the bioimaging ability (Fig. 43b). In vivo MRI was evaluated by intravenously injecting PB@MIL-100(Fe) into HeLa tumor bearing mice. As shown in Fig. 43c, T1-weighted MR images exhibited brighter and brighter signals at transverse planes in the tumor sites after 10, 30 min and 24 h, and T2-weighted MR images showed an obviously dark signal at the 30 min time point and then T2 intensity recovered at 24 h, which is attributed to the accumulation of PB@MIL-100(Fe) and the degradation of outer MIL-100(Fe) at the tumor sites. Lastly, in vivo antitumor experiments were carried out to evaluate the combined chemotherapy and photothermal therapy effect. The anti-cancer medicine artemisinin (ART), PB@MIL-100(Fe), and ART-loaded PB@MIL-100(Fe) were injected into tumor-bearing mice respectively, and then divided into seven groups, i.e., control group, NIR group, ART group, PB@MIL-100(Fe) group, PB@MIL-100(Fe) + NIR group, PB@MIL-100(Fe) + ART + NIR (non-encapsulated) and PB@MIL-100(Fe)@ART + NIR group. As shown in Fig. 43d, the PB@MIL-100(Fe)@ART showed excellent synergistic effects of chemotherapy and PTT for cancer therapy in vivo under irradiation of a NIR laser, far exceeding the effects of monotherapy.

8. Conclusions and future outlook
Photonic functional MOFs, as we have outlined in this review, have attracted tremendous attention due to their great advantages of flexible design, high porosities, tunable pores, and diverse functional sites. In fact, they are now active in luminescence sensing, white-light emission, photocatalysis, nonlinear optics, lasing devices, data storage, and biomedicine. In these examples, the photonic units of MOFs play an important and active role in generating, transporting, and storing photons or charge. Considering the vast combination possibilities, synergistic effects, as well as controllable and ordered arrangements of MPUs, we believe that there will be a brighter future for MOFs as photonic functional materials. However, there are still several interesting or important fields that need to be explored.
The rational design and synthesis of isoreticular MOFs with predictable structures/topologies and porosities is very important to systematically tune the photonic properties. A number of isoreticular MOFs have been realized by using M2(COO)4 (M = Zn2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Co2+) and Zn4O(COO)6 as SBUs, but it is still a significant challenge to synthesize isoreticular lanthanide MOFs with controllable and predictable structures due to the high coordination flexibility and the lack of preferential directionality of lanthanide ions. The molecular building block (MBB) approach recently proposed by Eddaoudi et al. is one of the breakthroughs in the construction of isoreticular lanthanide MOFs.34,93,97,348–350 This approach indicates that some polynuclear lanthanide clusters can be utilized as SBUs to construct a family of isoreticular lanthanide MOFs with tunable pore sizes and thus may assist chemists and material scientists to rationally develop lanthanide MOFs with desired photonic functionalities.
The photonic performance of MOF materials depends not only on their framework structures, but also on the synergistic and cooperative interactions among different photonic units such as metal nodes, organic linkers and guest molecules. For this reason, systematic investigations on the relationship among fabrication strategy, structural modulation, synergistic effects and the corresponding photonic properties of final products will be necessary and will speed up the development of photonic functional MOFs.
The research on luminescent MOF sensors is a relatively young field and still falls far behind that of their gas storage and separation applications. In MOF sensors, luminescence signals arisen from lanthanide ions, organic linkers, and charge transfer processes have been widely utilized to demonstrate the detection of small molecules, ionic species, VOCs, explosives, temperature, pH value, and so on. However, most of them are fulfilled based on the intensity change of one transition. This may lead to erroneous conclusions because the luminescence intensity can be heavily affected by the quantity of MOFs, excitation power, and the drifts of the optoelectronic system. To solve this problem, the ratiometric sensing approach based on dual-emitting MOFs has been established and thus opened a new strategy for high-accuracy luminescent sensors. In addition, developing a new multi-dimensional sensing strategy using intensity, lifetime, wavelength and polarization may be an appealing future direction to enhance the sensing accuracy.
The development of MOF-based photonic biosensors capable of intracellular sensing deserves much more attention, which will yield significant advancements in biomedical diagnostic and therapeutic science. Further efforts should be focused on the preparation of biologically compatible nano-MOFs with controllable size and morphology and the integration of different functionalities such as molecular targeting, luminescence sensing, cellular imaging, and so on. This ongoing research requires joint effort from different disciplines such as chemistry, materials science, photophysics, biology, and biomedicine. It is thus anticipated that the close collaborations will eventually lead to some useful photonic MOFs for commercial applications in the near future.
