    , Accepted 22nd December 2016First published on 22nd December 2016AbstractHigh-performance all-inorganic perovskite-based metal/semiconductor/metal (MSM) photodetectors with a bilayer composite film of mesoporous TiO2 and CsPbBr3 quantum dots as a photosensitizer were prepared. The photodetectors demonstrated significantly improved on/off ratios of nearly three orders of magnitude compared to those of pure bromine-based perovskite nanocrystal photodetectors with an MSM structure.
In recent years, lead halide semiconductors with perovskite crystal structures, primarily, hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, or I, or mixed Cl/Br and Br/I systems) have been the subject of intensive studies because of their outstanding optoelectronic characteristics. For instance, CH3NH3PbX3 perovskites have been used in solar cells with certified power conversion efficiencies of over 20%1–3 in highly sensitive photodetectors,4–6 high performance light emitting diodes (LED),7,8 and lasers.9
Herein, we use a modified facile one-pot colloidal synthesis, as reported by Protesescu et al.,10 for the preparation of inorganic cesium-based perovskite (CsPbX3) quantum dots (QDs). Inorganic perovskite QDs have potential applications in lighting, displays, solar cells, photodetectors, and lasing.11–14 Herein, we use inorganic perovskite QDs (mainly CsPbBr3) for the fabrication of photodetectors with a simple metal/semiconductor/metal (MSM) lateral structure. MSM lateral structure photodetectors have already been used in a variety of hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites, such as polycrystalline films,15 single-crystalline films,4 and nanowires.16–18 All-inorganic cesium-based perovskite MSM devices exhibited good on/off photocurrent ratios.19 However, when CsPbBr3 QDs were drop-cast on a glass substrate with pre-patterned gold electrodes, as reported by Ramasamy,19 the MSM photodetectors showed a limited photoresponse compared to CsPbBr3 nanosheet20 photodetectors. Devices fabricated using CsPbBr3 QDs capped with oleic acid were found to be insulating, and the carrier transport between the CsPbBr3 QDs did not improve even after annealing. Since the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 based photodetectors had significantly enhanced performance,21 maybe a scaffold material for QDs was needed. Subsequently, we found that mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) was a suitable scaffold material that has already been used in MSM ultraviolet photodetectors.22 Finally, we demonstrated that the device MSM I (see Fig. 1) was superior to the device based on entirely inorganic CsPbBr3 QDs only (MSM II). The high on/off ratio of 104 was three orders of magnitude higher than the device based on entirely inorganic CsPbBr3 QDs, and the responsivity increased from ∼80 mA W−1 (MSM II) to ∼3500 mA W−1 (MSM I).

The CsPbX3 QDs used herein were prepared via a synthesis based on ionic metathesis reactions in organic solvents and slightly modified from that reported in the literature10 (see details in the ESI†). We have synthesized a series of QD samples with different halide compositions and dot sizes. Then we focus our systematic investigation on CsPbBr3 QDs with a negligible influence of surface defects in trapping charge carriers23 which have ultrafast exciton dynamics and interfacial charge-transfer.24 The UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra are presented in Fig. 2a (for other halide-based QDs see Fig. S1, ESI†) and the cubic perovskite structure of the CsPbBr3 QDs is shown in Fig. 2b. The as-synthesized CsPbBr3 QDs have an absorbance edge at around 510 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 2.43 eV, and an emission peak at 514 nm with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) around 20 nm, which is consistent with the reported values.10Fig. 2c shows a typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of CsPbBr3 QDs and the corresponding analysis of the size distribution is shown in Fig. S2 (see the ESI†). It is observed that the typical CsPbBr3 QDs have an average diameter of 7.3 nm with a size deviation of ±1.44 nm. The inset in Fig. 2c illustrates a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the QDs. The HRTEM image highlights that the CsPbBr3 QDs have a well-defined crystalline structure with an interplanar distance of 5.8 Å, corresponding to the (001) crystal faces. As shown in Fig. 2d, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the CsPbBr3 QDs was obtained, and the characteristic peaks correspond to the cubic structure (PDF#54-0752), which is consistent with the HRTEM (Fig. 2c) observation. Time-resolved PL (TRPL) decays of the CsPbBr3 QD solution show that the radiative lifetimes were 12.3, 42.4, and 189 ns, which occupy 21.3%, 56.4%, and 22.3% ratios, respectively (Fig. S3 and Table S1, ESI†).

To illustrate the photoresponse of our perovskite-based photodetectors (MSM I and MSM II, Fig. 1), two-probe I–V was measured in the dark and under illumination using a halogen lamp. As shown in Fig. 3a, not only the dark current of the MSM I (black solid square line) is much lesser than that of the MSM II (black open circle line), but also the photocurrent of the MSM I (red solid square line) is much larger than that of the MSM II (red open circle line). The corresponding on/off ratios of the devices at different biases show that the introduction of mp-TiO2 into the pure QD photodetector improved the on/off ratio by about three orders of magnitude under an applied bias voltage of 8 V, as shown in Fig. S5.† In order to demonstrate the effect of mp-TiO2 in the device MSM I, we measured the dark and photocurrent I–V curves of a pure mp-TiO2 photodetector. As shown in Fig. S7 (see the ESI†), the photocurrent of the pure mp-TiO2 photodetector was even smaller than the dark current. This decrease in the photocurrent could be explained by the presence of water molecules or oxygen escaped from the surface of mp-TiO2 under illumination. When the CsPbBr3 QDs were coated on or embedded into the mp-TiO2 film, the dark current of mp-TiO2 was reduced remarkably and the hysteresis was suppressed as well (Fig. S8, ESI†). This might originate from the surface passivation of CsPbBr3 QDs. In order to investigate the effect of the CsPbBr3 QD on the reduction of hysteresis and passivation of the mp-TiO2 surface further,25 we investigated the charge dynamics by measuring the PL and TRPL of the QDs on mp-TiO2 and the glass substrate. As shown in Fig. 3b, the PL intensity of QDs/mp-TiO2 was reduced by a two-fold magnitude compared to that of the QDs on glass. It strongly indicates that mp-TiO2 can extract charge carriers from the CsPbBr3 QDs. Meanwhile, we found that the emission peak had markedly shifted to the blue, from 517 nm (a slight red shift compared with the QD solution whose peak was 514 nm) to 492 nm. This could be explained by the interface effect of TiO2 nanocrystals, which can relieve the effect of oleic acid, a long ligand of the CsPbBr3 QDs, and result in the smaller QDs in CsPbBr3–TiO2 composite than in solution. The blue shift might originate from the redistribution of electronic density and enhancement of electron confinement due to the loss of the long ligand. Another possible reason for the blue-shift was the filter-like feature of mp-TiO2, which causes small QDs to be adsorbed easily, allowing the large QDs to be washed away by the organic solvent. However, the average size of the mesopores on the surface of the mp-TiO2 is more than 40 nm (Fig. S6, ESI†), which is much bigger than the size of CsPbBr3 QDs. The morphologies of the mp-TiO2 film are shown in Fig. S6a (top view) and S6b† (cross-sectional). So the possibility of the filter-like feature of mp-TiO2 was ruled out. Furthermore, the TRPL was measured by monitoring the peak emission at 768 nm, as shown in Fig. 3c. Fitting the data with a biexponential decay yields three time constants, τ1, τ2, τ3, and τave as summarized in Table S1.† As the QDs formed a thin film, the radiative lifetimes decrease because of the emerging interfaces between the QDs. For the pure QD film after annealing, τ1 was 1.5 ns with a 38.3% ratio, τ2 was 7.5 ns with a 39.3% ratio and τ3 was 57.1 ns with 22.4%. As for QDs on the mp-TiO2 film, τ1, τ2, and τ3 decreased to 1.0, 4.0, and 16.5 ns, respectively, and τ2 was more dominant. This provided further evidence of the electron transfer between the QDs and the mp-TiO2. The time response behaviors of the photodetectors are shown in Fig. 3d, from which it can be seen that the MSM I photodetector switches much slower. This disadvantage might originate from the inadequate surface passivation of CsPbBr3 QDs. The oxygen adsorption–desorption at the TiO2 surface plays an important role, and the photoresponse rate is mainly determined by the rate of oxygen adsorption–desorption.26 As shown in Fig. 3e, the percentage of absorption of QDs on the mp-TiO2 film was far lesser than in the pure QDs after annealing the film. As the QDs did not cover the surface of mp-TiO2 completely and fill the mesopores sufficiently, when the time response behaviors of the photodetectors were measured in ambient air, it showed a slow time response for a full-spectrum light source. The wavelength-dependent photoresponsivity of MSM I and MSM II photodetectors measured at 4 V is plotted in Fig. 2f. The photoresponse curves of both the MSM I and MSM II photodetectors show good agreement with the absorption spectrum, and the responsivity increased from ∼80 mA W−1 (MSM II) to ∼3500 mA W−1 (MSM I) because of the effects of mp-TiO2. Based on these results, it is apparent that the MSM photodetectors employing a bilayer composite film of mesoporous TiO2 and CsPbBr3 QDs as a photosensitizer exhibit a significantly enhanced performance than the pure QD device. In addition, the poor time response characteristics need to be further improved, such as increasing the rate or efficiency of electron injection from the QDs into the TiO2 nanoparticles.

(f) The responsivity (R) of our fabricated perovskite-based photodetectors in the UV-visible region (λ 350–550 nm) under 4 V bias. 
The observed I–V characteristics of our devices can be explained by schematic energy-band diagrams, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Owing to the large difference between the work function of the Au electrode (5.1 eV, Fig. 4c) and the electron affinity of the mp-TiO2 film (4.1 eV, Fig. 4c), the pure mp-TiO2 device showed back-to-back symmetric Schottky junctions, as shown in Fig. S9a and b (see the ESI†). The mechanism of the fabricated MSM II is shown in Fig. S9c and d (see the ESI†). The device MSM II has a limited photoresponse because of the blocking effect of the interface or the presence of space between the QDs even after annealing at 200 °C for 30 min under an N2 atmosphere. Hence, we figured out the device MSM I (see Fig. 1a), and its mechanism, as illustrated in Fig. 4a and b. When the device MSM I operates in the dark, there are no stimulated excitons generated in the QDs, and when light is incident on the fabricated device, the QDs absorb photons to generate a large number of electrons and holes. Whereas, mp-TiO2 is a well-known n-type material, and there is no electron barrier formed in the interface between the QDs and the TiO2, as shown in Fig. 4b. Many electrons can take part in the photocurrent before hole extraction or recombination occurs, which generates the photoconductive gain.27 Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes are trapped on the surface of the CsPbBr3 QDs because of the large energy barrier. Fig. 4a illustrates the photogenerated charge transfer process. As a result, the device MSM I is expected to operate with high responsivity. Bromine-based all-inorganic perovskite QDs should perform worse than CsPbI3 QDs, as reported19 for a full-spectrum light source because of the larger bandgap of CsPbBr3 QDs. However, the mechanism of a bilayer composite should be appropriate for iodine, bromine, chlorine, or their mixture based all-inorganic perovskite QDs.

In conclusion, photodetectors employing a bilayer composite film of mp-TiO2 and CsPbBr3 QDs as a photosensitizer exhibited a significantly enhanced performance compared to those of pure bromine-based perovskite nanocrystal photodetectors with the same structure. This photodetector device demonstrated a significantly improved on/off ratio by about three orders of magnitude. At the same time, the photoresponsivity is about 44 times that of the device without mp-TiO2. However, the time response behaviors suggest that the introduction of mp-TiO2 has a great impact upon the switching characteristic. There is a significant potential for improving this kind of structure, such as ligand-exchange (using bifunctional surface modifiers such as MPA, TAA, and EDT28,29) and amorphous fluoropolymer films (using CYTOP30).
