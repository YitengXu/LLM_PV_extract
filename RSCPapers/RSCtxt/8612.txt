    , Accepted 17th November 2011First published on 15th December 2011AbstractA promising dual-mode solar spectral converter CaLaGa3S6O:Ce3+,Pr3+ for Si solar cells has been successfully developed. The structure, photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra in the UV-Vis-NIR region, and the decay curves have been systematically investigated. The results show that CaLaGa3S6O:Ce3+,Pr3+ exhibits two distinct solar spectral converting behaviors, quantum cutting (QC) (3PJ = 0,1,2 → 1G4 → 3H4) and downshift (DS) processes (1D2 → 3FJ = 3,4), depending on different excited levels of Pr3+ and Ce3+. It can almost harvest UV-blue-red (250–625 nm) photons, greatly enhancing the utilization of solar spectrum especially in UV-Vis spectrum region, and convert into an intense broad NIR emission (930–1060 nm), perfectly matching the maximum spectral response of Si solar cells. We demonstrate that Ce3+/Pr3+ ions can form an efficient donor–acceptor pair, with high potential as full spectrum solar converter for Si solar cells, and Ce3+ ion can be an efficient sensitizer for harvesting UV photon and greatly enhancing the NIR emission of Pr3+ ion through efficient energy feeding by allowed 4f–5d absorption of Ce3+ ion with high oscillator strength. The NIR integrated emission intensity of CaLaGa3S6O:Ce3+,Pr3+ is 7.78 times as intense as that of a NIR quantum cutting phosphor Ca2BO3Cl:Ce3+,Tb3+,Yb3+ (CBC). We believe this new dual-mode solar spectral converter may open a new route to the design of advanced UV-Vis–NIR phosphors for Si based solar cell applications.
1. Introduction
One of the most pressing issues of our time is clean energy. The basis of the problem lies not only in the fact that we have limited fossil fuel resources, but also in the greenhouse gas emissions created by burning these fuels, which is creating a growing problem in global warming. The goal of current energy policy worldwide is to develop clean renewable energy capable of powering the world household and economy, now and in the future. Photovoltaics (PV) is an advanced technique that can directly convert clear and sustainable solar energy into electricity, which makes it a promising candidate for achieving this goal. Currently, PV devices fabricated from silicon (Si) wafers dominate the marketplace. Unfortunately, current silicon based PV products are expensive and suffer poor efficiency when converting solar energy to electricity. Consequently, only a small fraction of current electrical energy generation comes from PV systems despite the fact that PVs have long been an important component of this strategy.1–3 In order for PVs to play a major role in future energy generation it is necessary that the efficiency of these systems is improved.
At present, the mismatch between the solar photon flux spectrum and the spectral response of Si solar cells is one of the main factors limiting the efficiency of Si solar cell. The incident solar spectrum dominates in the UV-Vis region whereas Si solar cells most effectively convert near infrared (NIR) photons of lower energy close to the semiconductor band gap (Eg ≈ 1.12 ev, λ ≈ 1000 nm). Consequently, this mismatch leads to about 70% energy loss of UV-Vis photons in form of heat. This extra heat energy significantly causes the charges thermalization of Si solar cell in the process of photoelectric conversion, which limits the efficiency of Si solar cell to about 15%. If UV-Vis photons of high energy can be converted into NIR photons of low energy prior to being absorbed into Si solar cell, the charges thermalization of Si solar cells will be greatly decreased due to the perfect energy matching between the incident NIR lights and the spectral response of Si solar cells.2
Downconversions including downshift (DS) and quantum cutting (QC), are important methods of modifying the solar photon flux spectrum. Recently, many efforts have been made to develop NIR QC phosphors co-doped with the RE3+–Yb3+ (RE = Tb, Pr, Tm, Er, Nd) couple.4–8 In these system, Yb3+ ions are used as NIR emitting centers due to the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition at about 1000 nm, perfectly matching with the band gap of c-Si. It is well known that Yb3+ ion only has a single excited 2F5/2 state approximately 1000 nm above the ground 2F7/2 state, therefore , it usually has no direct absorptions in the UV-Vis (300–800 nm) range. Consequently, it is necessary to add codopants, for instance RE3+ (RE = Tb, Pr, Tm, Er, Nd) ions acting as the sensitizer, to absorb UV-Vis photons and transfer the energy to Yb3+ ion. In this process, one UV-Vis photon can, theoretically, be cut into two NIR photons. Even so, these kinds of NIR QC systems encounter three significant drawbacks. First, the RE3+ ion has only narrow and much weaker absorption peaks in the UV-Vis–blue region because its f → f absorption transitions are forbidden by the parity selection rule and its optical oscillator strength is small. Second, the RE3+-Yb3+ couple can only convert UV–blue (300 nm < λ < 500 nm) photons rather than other visible photons into NIR photons (λ ≈ 1000 nm). Finally, the QC mechanism is mostly assigned to be a second-order cooperative energy transfer process. Consequently, the energy transfer probability is relatively low, and higher quantum efficiency is only reached at high acceptor (Yb3+) concentration where the emission intensity is strongly reduced by concentration quenching. All the shortcomings mentioned above severely limit their potential applications for Si solar cells.
In this paper, we have developed a novel dual-mode solar spectral converter CaLaGa3S6O:Ce3+,Pr3+ (CLGSO:Ce3+,Pr3+) for Si solar cells. It can almost harvest UV-blue–red (250–625 nm) photons directly by allowing 4f–5d absorption of Ce3+ ion with high oscillator strength as well as 4f → 4f absorption transitions of Pr3+ ion, greatly broadening and enhancing the solar utilization of Si solar cell especially in UV-Vis spectrum region. Furthermore, by dual-mode solar spectral converting behavior, quantum cutting and downshift processes, it efficiently converts UV-Vis photons into an intense broad NIR emission (930–1060 nm), perfectly matching the maximum spectral response of Si solar cells. The NIR integrated emission intensity of CLGSO:Ce3+,Pr3+ is 7.78 times as intense as that of a NIR quantum cutting phosphor Ca2BO3Cl:Ce3+,Tb3+,Yb3+ (CBC).9 Furthermore, the QC mechanism in present case is proved to be a first-order energy transfer process (3Pj = 0,1,2 → 1G4 → 3H4). We believe this novel dual-mode solar spectral converter may open a new route to the design of advanced UV-Vis–NIR phosphors for Si based solar cell applications.
2. Experiments
All powder samples with the composition of CaLa1−x−yGa3S6O:xCe3+,yPr3+ (CLGSO:xCe3+,yPr3+; x = 0, 0.01; y = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25) were prepared by a two-step solid-state reaction. The first step was to prepare the starting sulfide materials. The starting sulfide materials β-La2S3, Ga2S3, γ-Ce2S3 and γ-Pr2S3 were prepared from La2O3(99.99%), Ga2O3(99.99%), CeO2(99.99%) and Pr6O11(99.9%) under CS2 reducing atmosphere at 800 °C, 950 °C, 1250 °C and 1200 °C for 3 h in a horizontal tube furnace, respectively. The second step was as follows: The stoichiometric amounts of materials CaO(A.R.), β-La2S3, Ga2S3, γ-Ce2S3 and γ-Pr2S3 were thoroughly mixed in agate mortar with a pestle and then the mixture was transferred into crucibles and sintered at 950 °C for 2 h under Ar atmosphere in horizontal tube furnace. Ca2BO3Cl:Ce3+,Tb3+,Yb3+ (CBC) was prepared according to Ref. 9.

Powder X-ray diffraction was performed on Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with CuKa (λ = 1.5405 Å) radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. High quality XRD data for Rietveld refinement was collected over a 2θ range from 10° to 100° at an interval of 0.02°. Structural refinement of XRD data was performed using the TOPAS-Academic program.10 The photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra at room temperature as well as the decay curves were measured by FSP920-combined Time Resolved and Steady State Fluorescence Spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments) equipped with a 450 W Xe lamp, a 150w nF900 flash lamp, TM300 excitation monochromator and double TM300 emission monochromators, thermo-electric cooled red sensitive PMT and R5509-72 NIR-PMT in a liquid nitrogen cooled housing (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K). The spectral resolution for the steady measurements is about 0.05 nm in UV-VIS and about 0.075–0.01 nm in NIR, and the experimental conditions for the transient measurements are a pulse width of 1.0–1.6 ns, a repetition rate of 40 KHz and the lifetime range of 100 ps–50 μs.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterization
The XRD measurement was carried out at room temperature. Fig. 1 shows the Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern of the CLGSO:0.01Ce3+,0.06Pr3+ using the P21m structure model reported by C. L. Teske,11 which converged to Rwp = 4.44% and RB = 2.84%. All of the observed peaks are consistent with the lattice constants and the reflection conditions, indicating the formation of a single phase with no impurities. Table 1 shows the final refined structural parameters for the CLGSO:0.01Ce3+,0.06Pr3+. The refined cell parameters for CLGSO:0.01Ce3+,0.06Pr3+, a = b = 9.2935(6) Å, c = 6.0401(6) Å, are smaller than those for the parent material synthesized in our study (a = b = 9.2949(6) Å, c = 6.0413(5) Å), which is consistent with the substitution of smaller Ce3+(114.3 pm)/Pr3+(112.6 pm) for La3+(116 pm).12

3.2 The diffuse reflection and UV-Vis photoluminescence properties of CLGSO:Ce3+/Pr3+
High absorption efficiency is necessary for luminescent materials to have expected high quantum efficiency. Fig. 2(a) show the diffuse reflection spectra of CLGSO and CLGSO:0.01Ce3+,0.06Pr3+. It is obvious that the host CLGSO shows an intense absorption band at ∼300 nm (max. 85%, compared with standard reference polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)). When Ce3+ ions are doped, there are two additional band at about 360 nm and 405 nm, due to the 4f–5d absorption transition of Ce3+. Moreover, the absorption intensity increases from 64% to 72% at 360 nm and from 39% to 52% at 405 nm by co-doping with Ce3+ ions. Therefore, it is expected for Ce3+ ion to contribute high NIR emission efficiency of Pr3+, which will be proved later.
 Fig. 2  a) The diffuse reflection spectra of CLGSO and CLGSO:0.01Ce3+,0.06Pr3+; The PLE and PL spectra of b) CLGSO:0.01Ce3+, c) CLGSO:0.01Pr3+ and d) CLGSO:0.01Ce3+,0.01Pr3+ . 

Fig. 2(b) shows the PLE and PL spectra of CLGSO:0.01Ce3+. Monitoring the emission at 434 nm, the PLE spectrum consists of three broad bands centering at 299 nm, 334 nm and 398 nm, due to the host absorption and the transitions of Ce3+ from the ground state to the field-splitting levels of the 5d1 state.13 The PL spectrum, recorded at λex = 400 nm, presents a broad band dominating at 434 nm and a shoulder band centering at 475 nm, which are attributed to the well-known 5d → 2F5/2 and 5d → 2F7/2 transitions of Ce3+. The energy difference of two sub-bands is about 1989 cm−1, which is close to the 2FJ (J = 7/2, 5/2) energy gap of Ce3+ (≈2000 cm−1) in most Ce3+ activated phosphors.14
The PLE and PL spectra of Pr3+ in CLGSO are presented in Fig. 2(c). The PLE spectrum of Pr3+ shows a number of absorption lines in the 440–500 nm region and a weak band peaking at about 299 nm. Those lines are assigned to the 3H4 → 3P0, 3P1/1I6, and 3P2 transitions of Pr3+. The weak band is due to the host absorption. The PL spectrum under 455 nm excitation mainly consists of four emission peaks centering at 492 nm, 535 nm, 627 nm and 651 nm, ascribed to the 3P0 → 3H4, 3P1 → 3H5, 3P0 → 3H6 and 3P0 → 3F2 transitions, respectively.15,16
By comparing the PLE spectrum of CLGSO:Pr3+ with the PL spectrum of CLGSO:Ce3+, it can be seen that there is a significant spectral overlap in the 440–500 nm region (shown in Fig. 2(b) and(c)). Therefore, the effective resonance-type energy transfer (ET) from Ce3+ to Pr3+ is strongly expected. Fig. 2 (d) gives the PLE and PL spectra of CLGSO:0.01Ce3+,0.01Pr3+ phosphor. The PLE spectra monitored at 434 and 651 nm are similar except for the difference in intensity. The presence of the 4f → 5d transitions of Ce3+ ion in the PLE spectrum of Pr3+ indicates that efficient ET from Ce3+ to Pr3+ occurs. Under 400 nm excitation of Ce3+ ion, there are blue bands, and green and red lines in the PL spectrum of Ce3+ and Pr3+ co-doped CLGSO phosphor(shown in Fig. 2(d)).
In order to optimize the emission of the Pr3+ ion, the concentration-dependent emission intensity of CLGSO:xCe3+,yPr3+ was studied. Fig. 3(a) shows the PL spectra of CLGSO:xCe3+,yPr3+ (x = 0.01; y = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25) under 400 nm excitation and Fig. 3(b) exhibits the effects of the concentration of Pr3+ on the integrated emission intensity of Ce3+ and Pr3+. It is obviously seen that with the increasing concentration of Pr3+, the emission intensity of Ce3+ decreases gradually while that of Pr3+ increases initially, then reaches a maximum value at y = 0.06 and finally exhibits an obvious decrease. This phenomenon further supports the presence of the ET from Ce3+ to Pr3+.
 Fig. 3  The PL spectra (λex = 400 nm) of CLGSO:xCe3+,yPr3+ (x = 0.01; y = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25). The inset shows the integrated emission intensity of Ce3+ and Pr3+ as a function of Pr3+ concentration. 
The spectral overlap between the broad band emission of Ce3+ and the excitation peaks of Pr3+ in the 440–500 nm region (shown in Fig. 2) indicates that the ET from Ce3+ to Pr3+ is probably the radiative or non-radiative resonant ET. In order to further investigate the actual ET mechanism, the lifetime dependence of Ce3+ on the concentration of Pr3+ was studied (shown in Fig. 4). It is clearly observed that with the increasing amount of Pr3+ ion, the lifetime of Ce3+ ion gradually decreases. The lifetime of Ce3+ ion is 19.68 ns for y = 0 mol% and 4.33 ns for y = 25 mol%. The decreasing lifetime of Ce3+ ion strongly suggests that the ET from Ce3+ to Pr3+ is resonant non-radiative ET. The ET efficiency of Ce3+ → Pr3+ can be estimated by the equation:17ηET = 1 − τ/τ0where, τ0 and τ are the lifetimes of Ce3+ ion in the absence and presence of Pr3+ ion, respectively. The ET efficiency of Ce3+ → Pr3+ in CLGSO:xCe3+,yPr3+ (x = 0.01; y = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25) is calculated and illustrated in the inset of Fig. 4. It is obviously seen that increases from 6.45% at y = 1 mol% to 52.29% at y = 10% and reaches the maximum value of 78.00% at y = 25 mol%. Before the luminescence concentration quenching of Pr3+ ions (y = 0.06), the maximum value of the ET efficiency is 36.99%.
 Fig. 4  The decay curves of CLGSO:xCe3+,yPr3+ (x = 0.01; y = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25) and ET efficiency as a function of Pr3+ concentration. 

Fig. 5 shows the schematic diagram for visible ET from Ce3+ to Pr3+. As shown in Fig. 5, the energy difference between the lowest 5d excitation level (∼23042 cm−1) of Ce3+ ion and the 3P2 level (∼22171 cm−1) of Pr3+ ion is about 871 cm−1. Usually, the maximum phonon frequency is about 500 cm−1 in oxysulfides.18 Therefore, it is reasonable that ET occurs via non-radiative transitions from the lowest 5d excitation level of Ce3+ ion to the 3P2 level of Pr3+ ion by assistance of about two phonons.

3.3 NIR photoluminescence properties of CLGSO:Ce3+,Pr3+

Fig. 6(a) shows the PLE and NIR emission spectra of CLGSO:0.06Pr3+. It is obviously seen that Pr3+ ion exhibits distinct PLE and NIR emission features. Monitoring the NIR emission at 948 nm, the PLE spectrum comprises a number of absorption lines of Pr3+ dominating in the 440–500 nm region and a weak band peaking at about 305 nm. These are due to 3H4 → 3P0, 3P1/1I6, and 3P2 transitions of Pr3+ and the host absorption, respectively. The PLE spectra, recorded at λem = 1034 nm, are almost identical to that recorded at 948 nm emission, except the prominent 3H4 → 1D2 excitation lines at 594 nm and 605 nm. Under excitation of 455 nm (3H4 → 3P2), the NIR emission spectrum mainly consists of one prominent emission peak at 948 nm as well as a shoulder at 1034 nm, due to 3P0 → 1G4 and 1G4 → 3H4 transitions, respectively. When excited by 605 nm (3H4 → 1D2), there is mainly one prominent emission at 1034 nm and a shoulder at 988 nm, assigned to 1D2 → 3F4 and 1D2 → 3F3 transitions, respectively.
 Fig. 6  The PLE and NIR emission spectra of CLGSO:0.06Pr3+ (a) and CLGSO:0.01Ce3+,0.06Pr3+ (b). 
In order to prove the above NIR assignments of Pr3+, the decay curves of CLGSO:0.06Pr3+ were measured and the lifetimes of visible and NIR emissions from 3P0 and 1D2 were presented in Table 2. In general, the decay time of the emission from 3P0 is 0.135–50 μs, shorter than that from 1D2, which is about 50–250 μs.19 In CLGSO:0.06Pr3+, the lifetimes of NIR emissions at 948 nm (λex = 492 nm), 988 nm and 1034 nm (λex = 605 nm) are evaluated to be 10.0 μs, 49.1 μs and 55.2 μs, respectively. They are almost the same as the 10.1 μs and 53.2 μs evaluated for visible emissions of Pr3+ from 3P0 at 492 nm (λex = 454 nm) and 1D2 at 605 nm (λex = 594 nm). These results strongly prove that the NIR emissions at 948 nm (λex = 492 nm), 988 nm and 1034 nm (λex = 605 nm) are ascribed to 3P0 → 1G4 and 1D2 → 3F3,4 transitions. Additionally, the lifetimes of NIR emissions at 1034 nm (λex = 492 nm) is estimated to be 23.8 μs (shown in Table 3), which is obviously smaller than 55.2 μs for the same NIR emission (λex = 605 nm). The NIR emission at 1034 nm (λex = 492 nm) may be due to the 1G4 → 3H4 transition of Pr3+. In general, the decay rate of the 1G4 level of Pr3+ is determined mainly by the maximum phonon energy of the host. For some fluorides with relatively low phonon frequency (∼500 cm−1), the lifetime of the 1G4 level of Pr3+ is about 15–38 μs, for example 17 μs for LiYF4 (566 cm−1) and 38 μs for BaY2F8 (415 cm−1)20 (shown in Table 3). The maximum phonon frequency is usually about 500 cm−1 in oxysulfides.18 Therefore, it is reasonable to observe comparable lifetime of the 1G4 level of Pr3+ in CLGSO with similar maximum phonon frequency. This also support the assignment of the NIR emission at 1034 nm (λex = 492 nm) to the 1G4 → 3H4 transition of Pr3+. Based on the above analysis, CLGSO:Pr3+ has dual-mode spectral converting behaviors, NIR QC process (3PJ = 0,1,2 → 1G4 → 3H4) and DS process (1D2 → 3FJ = 3,4), depending on different excited levels of Pr3+. Here dual-mode photoemissions come from the same luminescence center (Pr3+), which differs to those based on two different luminescent centers, for example, Eu-doped nanocrystalline Li2ZnSiO4 glass ceramics reported by G.

Fig. 7(a) shows the NIR emission mechanism of CLGSO:0.06Pr3+ under excitation into the 3PJ (J = 0,1,2) levels. Electrons are pumped from the ground 3H4 level into the excited 3P2, 3P1/1I6, and 3P0 levels, respectively, under 455, 480, and 492 nm excitation. They then relax to the emitting level of 3P0, from which the process of NIR QC (3P0 → 1G4 → 3H4) occurs. Therefore, the NIR emission peaking at 948 nm and 1034 nm were observed. Fig. 7(b) presents the NIR emission mechanism of CLGSO:0.06Pr3+ under excitation into the 1D2 level. Under 594 nm and 605 nm excitation, electron are directly jumped into the 1D2 level and then radiatively relax back to 3F3, 4, which reasonably gives the NIR emissions at 988 nm (1D2 → 3F3) and 1034 nm (1D2 → 3F4).

As mentioned above, the ideal solar spectral converter for Si solar cells should utilize the UV-Vis fraction of the solar photon flux spectrum and possess an intense NIR emission at ∼1000 nm, perfectly matching the maximum spectral response (λ ≈ 1000 nm) of Si semiconductor. From Fig. 6(a), it is obviously seen that CLGSO:Pr3+ meets the requirement of excitation and emission characteristics of luminescent QC material. But it can only absorb blue and red photons in the solar photon flux spectrum. In order to widen the utilization of the solar photon flux spectrum toward UV region, we further investigated the luminescent properties of CLGSO:Ce3+,Pr3+ and explored the possibility of Ce3+ ion as a donor utilizing UV photons and enhancing the NIR emission of Pr3+ ion.
As shown in Fig. 6(b), it is very interesting that upon 400 nm excitation of Ce3+ ion, CLGSO:0.01Ce3+,0.06Pr3+ exhibits intense NIR emissions of Pr3+ ion around 948 nm, 988 nm and 1034 nm. Monitoring the NIR emission at 948 and 1034 nm, it shows the same PLE features as those which allowed 4f–5d transitions of Ce3+ (shown in Fig. 2(b)) and the forbidden 4f → 4f transitions of Pr3+ ion (shown in Fig. 6(a)). The difference between Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 6(b) is that the host exhibits more intense absorption than the Ce3+ ion in Fig. 2(a) and contrarily shows much weaker excitation intensity than the Ce3+ ion in Fig. 6(b). This means that the Ce3+ ion, rather than the host, would show great impact on expected NIR quantum efficiency of Pr3+. Additionally, the appearance of 4f → 5d transitions of Ce3+ ion in the PLE spectrum (λem = 948, 1034 nm) of Pr3+ suggests UV-to-NIR ET from Ce3+ to Pr3+ occurs. These results successfully demonstrated that Ce3+ ion can be used as a donor utilizing UV photons and greatly enhancing the NIR emission of Pr3+ ion through efficient energy feeding by allowed 4f–5d absorption of Ce3+ ion with high oscillator strength.

Fig. 8 presents the solar photon flux spectrum, the spectral response of c-Si solar cells and spectra of CLGSO:Ce3+,Pr3+ and Ca2BO3Cl:0.002Ce3+,0.02Tb3+,0.01Yb3+ (CBC).9 CBC, as recently demonstrated by us, is a known NIR quantum cutting phosphor, which shows promise as a solar spectral converter. We demonstrated that the Ce3+ ion was an efficient sensitizer, harvesting UV photons and greatly enhancing the NIR emission of Yb3+ ion through efficient energy feeding by allowing 4f–5d absorption of Ce3+ ion with high oscillator strength. Even so, CBC does not have prominent absorption beyond 315 nm, as shown in Fig. 8(a). Therefore, it can not effectively harvest UV-Vis (300–500 nm) photons of the solar photon flux spectrum. Comparatively, the phosphor CLGSO:Ce3+,Pr3+ has a broader absorption band extending from 250 to 625 nm, except a small gap between 500–580 nm. Such a wide and intense excitation band almost covers the whole UV-to-red visible region of the solar photon flux spectrum (shown in Fig. 8(a)). Moreover, CLGSO:Ce3+,Pr3+ has an intense and wide emission band dominating from 930 nm to 1060 nm. Under 400 nm excitation, the NIR integrated emission intensity of CLGSO:0.01Ce3+,0.06Pr3+ is 1.16 and 7.78 times that of Ca2BO3Cl:0.002Ce3+,0.02Tb3+,0.01Yb3+ with the excitation of 360 nm and 400 nm, respectively. These are rare but desirable characteristics that are not present in previously studied Yb3+ activated system with high NIR quantum efficiency (>100%). These results also demonstrate that CLGSO:Ce3+,Pr3+ can harvest UV-blue-red photons of the solar photon flux spectrum and may potentially reduce the charge thermalization in Si solar cells by dual-mode (QC and DS) spectral modification. In the future, it should be combined with an Si solar cell in order to give direct evidence on the extent to which the efficiency of the Si solar cell is increased. The potential design of a PV module may consist of Si solar cell and incoming converter on the front surface of Si solar cell. In this case, high-energy photons in the UV-Vis region can be first effectively converted into NIR photons and then the converted NIR photons would be absorbed by Si solar cell. So, the converted or modified solar photon flux spectrum would match well with the spectral response of Si solar cell. This may greatly reduce charge thermalization due to the mismatch discussed previously. Moreover, one high energy photon will theoretically create two electron-hole pairs in the QC process. Consequently, this may allow for great enhancement of the solar utilization of Si solar cells, especially in UV-blue spectrum region. Most importantly, the converter should be in an improved form of glass or thin film, with a refractive index close to that of an Si solar cell, appropriate transparency and excellent chemical stability, etc. From the viewpoint of spectrum features, CLGSO:Ce3+,Pr3+ is a truly promising dual-mode spectral-converting material to match the solar photon flux spectrum and the spectral response of c-Si solar cell.

Conclusions
In summary, we develop a dual-mode solar spectral converter CaLaGa3S6O:Ce3+,Pr3+ for Si solar cells. The results show that CaLaGa3S6O:Ce3+,Pr3+ shows two distinct solar spectral converting behaviors, quantum cutting (QC) (3PJ = 0,1,2 → 1G4 → 3H4) and downshift (DS) processes (1D2 → 3FJ = 3,4), depending on different excitation levels of Pr3+ and Ce3+. It has intense wide excitation bands in the UV-to-red visible region (250 nm–625 nm) and exhibits a greatly enhanced NIR emission of Pr3+ around ∼1000 nm, perfectly matching the maximum spectral response of Si solar cells. The NIR integrated emission intensity of CaLaGa3S6O:Ce3+,Pr3+ is 7.78 times as intense as that of a NIR quantum cutting phosphor Ca2BO3Cl:Ce3+,Tb3+, Yb3+ (CBC). It demonstrates that Ce3+/Pr3+ ions can be an efficient donor–acceptor pair with high potential as full spectrum solar converter for Si solar cells, and Ce3+ ion can be an efficient sensitizer for harvesting UV photon and greatly enhancing the NIR emission of Pr3+ ion through efficient energy feeding by allowing 4f–5d absorption of Ce3+ ion with high oscillator strength. We believe this new dual-mode solar spectral converter may open a new route to the design of advanced UV-Vis-to-NIR phosphors for Si based solar cell applications.
