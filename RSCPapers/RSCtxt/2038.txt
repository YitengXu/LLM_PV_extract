    , Accepted 6th July 2021First published on 7th July 2021AbstractThe light harvesting and photocurrent generation from acceptors largely determine the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). We have designed and prepared two medium band gap non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr, containing end groups with low electron affinity. The absorption spectrum and the energy level are simultaneously finely tuned through the weak electron-withdrawing end group to serve as an excellent third component in ternary organic solar cells (TOSCs). The emission spectra of BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr mostly overlap with the absorption spectrum of the Y6 film, and efficient energy transfer is achieved from BTIC-EH-2ThBr or BTIC-BO-2ThBr to Y6. A cascade in the energy alignment could also be obtained. The morphology of the PM6:Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr blend film has been optimized with the addition of BTIC-EH-2ThBr as a third component. The introduction of a medium band gap molecule, BTIC-EH-2ThBr, alleviates excessive aggregation behavior and the crystallinity of the PM6:Y6 blend film. In this way, a high efficiency ternary device has been obtained with improved charge separation, transportation, collection and reduced exciton recombination. Overall, a TOSC based on PM6:Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr delivers the highest photovoltaic performance of 17.54% with enhanced photo utilization.
1 Introduction
Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) possess a number of advantages compared to their fullerene counterparts. These include excellent tunability of chemical structures and electronic energy levels, strong absorption in the visible to near-infrared (NIR) range, and better compatibility with donor materials.1–5 The rapid development of NFAs has brought new vitality and great prospects for the application of organic solar cells (OSCs), and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 18% have been achieved with the new material structure and optimization of the device processes.6–8 Photocurrent generation in fullerene organic solar cells is predominantly derived from the photoexcitation of the donor material, which limits the promotion of photocurrent in OSCs.9 Fortunately, the emergence of NFAs has provided a new solution for this problem since 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) was reported in 2015.10 The acceptor absorption in NFA solar cells constitutes a significant part of the total absorption in the active layer, and the device photocurrent which benefits from the additional photoexcitation of the acceptor material has been significantly improved.11–13 Consequently, increasing light harvesting of NFAs and achieving complementary absorption to donors have combined into an effective method to further promote device performance.14,15 From the perspective of energy levels, the cascade in the energy alignment is conducive to higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) and simultaneously assists with the efficient dissociation of excitons.16 Complementary absorption and gradient energy levels can be obtained through careful design and selection of donor and acceptor materials in the active layer.17–20 The narrow bandgap acceptor Y6 reported by Zou et al.21 represents a breakthrough in the improvement of device performance, and yielded a PCE of 15.7% when blended with polymer donor PM6. Numerous studies on Y6 derivatives have been reported, and it was found that the narrow bandgap (1.33 eV) and the preservation of endgroup packing of Y6 are of great significance.22–29 On this basis, further improved device performance can be achieved by adding a third component, a medium band gap NFA which has absorption and energy levels complementary to those of PM6 and Y6.30–33 In particular, when the emission spectra of the third component overlap with the absorption spectrum of Y6, an efficient resonant Förster energy transfer can be achieved in TOSCs.34,35 Consequently, more photons can be harvested and transferred from the third component to Y6 and more charge carriers will be generated. An exception is that the working mechanism in organic photovoltaics, the absorption of photons and creation of excitons, also includes diffusion of excitons to D/A interfaces and dissociation to free charge carriers, transportation of the charge carriers to electrodes and charge extraction at electrodes. In organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, improved exciton dissociation probability and exciton lifetimes were necessary to generate more free charge carriers, and charge carrier mobilities, lifetime and extraction capability were also required to realize high photo utilization, which leads to a superior PCE. In addition to the inherent photoelectric properties of materials, the morphology of the active layer can greatly affect the photoelectric conversion process of the organic solar cell described above.
In this work, we fabricated two medium band gap NFAs, BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr, with different side chains. The chemical structures of PM6, Y6, BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr are displayed in Fig. 1a and S1.† These two NFAs have similar skeleton structures to Y6 thus ensuring good compatibility and intermolecular interactions. The endgroup 2ThBr was chosen to fine tune the photoelectric properties, intermolecular interaction and film morphology.36,37 The electronegativity of the endgroup was weakened in order to obtain a larger optical band gap and high energy levels. The bromine atom was adopted as the thiophene substituent, and bromination was proved to be an efficient strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.38,39 After optimization, an impressive PCE of 17.54% was achieved for TOSCs based on the PM6:Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr blend, along with a VOC of 0.853 V, a JSC of 26.39 mA cm−2, and an FF of 77.90%. In contrast, binary devices based on the PM6:Y6 blend showed a PCE of 16.35%, and the TOSCs based on the PM6:Y6:BTIC-BO-2ThBr blend showed a PCE of 16.86%. The highest device efficiency based on PM6:Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr is mainly derived from the wide photon harvesting range, the cascade in the energy alignment and the improved compatibility among the three components. The third component, BTIC-EH-2ThBr, serves as an additional absorber which captures more photons for the active layer and transfers the photogenerated excitons to Y6. The VOC of the devices also increased with the existence of the third component, the carrier concentration in the device increased accordingly and the charge separation or transportation was improved. The morphology of the blend film was optimized by the introduction of BTIC-EH-2ThBr with weaker crystallinity. This research provides a strategy to improve photon utilization and effectively improve device efficiency.

2 Results and discussion
2.1. Materials synthesis and characterization
The synthetic pathways to BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr are shown in the ESI.† These materials were synthesized by a Knoevenagel condensation reaction between BTIC-2CHO-EH/BO (with 2-ethylhexyl or 2-butyloctyl side chains) and the Br-substituted end group. Different flexible side chains were adopted in order to study the influence of the side chains on solubility and aggregation behavior. The molecules were purified by flash column chromatography with CHCl3 as the eluent and further purified with preparative HPLC to obtain the product. The two molecules are soluble in CHCl3 at 50 °C and CHCl3 was used as the device processing solvent. The chemical structures of the Br-substituted end group and the two molecules were characterized by 1H NMR, as shown in Fig. S7–S9.†
The normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of PM6, Y6, BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr in films are shown in Fig. 1c and Table 1. The absorption spectra of BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr were exactly between those of PM6 and Y6. These two molecules have broad and strong absorption in the 500–800 nm range with an absorption onset of 810 nm and an optical bandgap of 1.53 eV. The maximum absorption peaks of BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr are located at 718 nm, exhibiting an obvious blue-shift of about 120 nm when compared with that of Y6. This blue-shift of absorption peaks originates from the weak electronegativity of the 2ThBr end groups. The malononitrile group of Y6 is replaced by a carbonyl group with weaker electron withdrawing ability, and the intramolecular charge transfer interaction is correspondingly weakened. The optical band gaps of these two molecules are significantly widened. The complementary absorption of PM6, Y6 and the third component in the 500–800 nm range is beneficial for photon harvesting of TOSCs.

The energy levels of the materials were measured in thin films by a cyclic voltammetry (CV) method (Fig. S2†), and the corresponding energy level diagrams are shown in Fig. 1d and Table 2. BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr exhibit higher energy levels than Y6, and this supports a higher VOC. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr were determined to be −5.47 and −5.48 eV, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were −3.69 and −3.71 eV. A cascade in the energy alignment could be achieved in TOSCs, and the energy loss will be reduced due to the narrowing LUMO level offset. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level were used to investigate the molecular orbital levels of BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr (Fig. S3a†). The HOMO and LUMO of these two molecules are mainly distributed throughout the entire molecule, and the calculated energy levels are consistent with those from CV measurements. The band gaps of the two molecules calculated by DFT are quite wide, which is consistent with the blue-shift of the absorption spectra. This demonstrates that varying the end groups may effectively influence the band gap and adjust the absorption spectrum of the molecule. The optimized configurations of BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr were also achieved from DFT calculations (Fig. S3†). By such calculations, the dihedral angle of the twisted backbone was obtained, permitting a study of the influence of alkyl chains on the molecular geometry. A larger dihedral angle of BTIC-EH-2ThBr is conducive to the formation of smaller domain sizes, and this may help to avoid excessive phase separation.

2.2. Photovoltaic performance
To verify this design concept, binary and ternary devices were fabricated with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:acceptor/PNDIT-F3N/Ag (Fig. 1b). The optimal devices were fabricated from a CHCl3 solution with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1, with the addition of 0.5% v/v CN as the additive, and a D/A weight ratio of 1:1.2, after which thermal annealing was conducted at 110 °C for 10 min. The ternary devices were fabricated with a D/A weight ratio of 1:1.2, modifying the proportion of BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr in the blend films. The J–V curves of the optimal binary and ternary devices are shown in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The binary device based on PM6:Y6 exhibits a PCE of 16.35% with a VOC of 0.840 eV, JSC of 25.92 mA cm−2, and an FF of 75.13%, which are consistent with reported data. The ternary device with 10 wt% BTIC-EH-2ThBr showed the highest PCE of 17.54% with a simultaneously enhanced VOC of 0.853 eV, JSC of 26.39 mA cm−2 and an FF of 77.90% compared with the binary device based on PM6:Y6. The ternary device with 10 wt% BTIC-BO-2ThBr exhibits slightly inferior device performances with a PCE of 16.86% compared with BTIC-EH-2ThBr based TOSCs. This was attributed to the differences caused by different side chains. The corresponding device physics and morphology analysis will be required to explore the reasons for these differences. The J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters of ternary devices with different BTIC-EH-2ThBr weight ratios are shown in Fig. S6† and Table S3.† The VOC of the devices increased gradually from 0.840 to 0.881 eV with the weight ratio of BTIC-EH-2ThBr increasing from 0% to 20%. At the same time, the PCE of the devices with the weight ratio of BTIC-EH-2ThBr from 5% to 20% was higher than that of the binary devices, at over 17%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices are shown in Fig. 2b. The EQE values of the ternary devices were over 85% after the addition of the third component as an additional absorber. The enhanced EQE response in the range of 500–900 nm mainly comes from the enhanced photon harvesting, and the more efficient charge separation, transportation and collection, as is discussed below. In the absorption spectrum region, more photons were converted into effective photocurrent through the addition of BTIC-EH-2ThBr or BTIC-BO-2ThBr. The integrated JSC values calculated from the EQE spectra are also listed in Table 1, and are highly consistent with the JSC from the J–V curves.

2.3. Charge generation, transport, extraction and recombination
To understand the significant differences in device performance, the dynamics behavior of excitons and charge carriers was also characterized. The probability of exciton dissociation (Jph/Jsat) was studied in terms of the relationship between photocurrent densities (Jph) versus the effective voltages (Veff), which is shown in Fig. 2c. The competition between carrier extraction and recombination will reduce the value of Jph in devices. The ternary device based on PM6:Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr exhibited the highest exciton dissociation probability of 98.4% compared with the ternary device based on PM6:Y6:BTIC-BO-2ThBr (97.6%) and the binary device based on PM6:Y6 (97.5%). This suggests a more efficient exciton dissociation and photogeneration in PM6:Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr.40 The bimolecular recombination dynamics of carriers in the devices were characterized through the study of JSCversus light intensity, which is shown in Fig. 2d. The relationship between JSC and light intensity was expressed as JSC ∝ Plightα. The slope α of the PM6:Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr based device was calculated as 0.987, and those of PM6:Y6:BTIC-BO-2ThBr and PM6:Y6 were 0.982 and 0.981, respectively. This indicates that the bimolecular recombination in the three kinds of devices was restrained efficiently. The hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of the devices were determined through the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method in order to clarify the carrier transport performance. The single-carrier device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag was adopted for hole mobilities, and that of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PNDIT-F3N/Ag for electron mobilities. As shown in Fig. S4† and Table S1,† the μh values were measured as 3.10 × 10−4, 5.42 × 10−4, and 3.61 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the μe values were 4.98 × 10−4, 7.58 × 10−4, and 5.91 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr, and PM6:Y6:BTIC-BO-2ThBr, respectively. Among these, the addition of BTIC-EH-2ThBr effectively increased the μh and μe simultaneously, which is consistent with the increased JSC and FF. The photoinduced carrier sweep-out values (ts) were measured using the transient photocurrent (TPC) (Fig. 2e) and charge carrier lifetimes (τ) were studied through the transient photovoltage (TPV) (Fig. 2f). Photoinduced carrier extraction of TOSCs based on PM6:Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr (ts = 0.30 μs) was faster than that of the devices based on PM6:Y6 (ts = 0.44 μs) and PM6:Y6:BTIC-BO-2ThBr (ts = 0.36 μs). The TOSCs based on PM6:Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr also demonstrated a longer charge carrier lifetime τ (τ = 1.40 μs) than the devices based on PM6:Y6 (τ = 1.05 μs) and PM6:Y6:BTIC-BO-2ThBr (τ = 1.16 μs). It could be concluded that the mechanism of device performance improvement after the addition of BTIC-EH-2ThBr is explained from the perspective of excitons and carrier dynamics. The photon harvesting was enhanced by the addition of a medium band gap NFA, BTIC-EH-2ThBr, as an additional absorber. At the same time, the exciton dissociation and carrier extraction were promoted due to the existence of BTIC-EH-2ThBr. The bimolecular recombination of the carriers in the TOSC based on BTIC-EH-2ThBr was restrained efficiently, and the carrier mobility was improved significantly. The higher JSC, FF and PCE of the TOSC based on BTIC-EH-2ThBr were achieved as a result of the improvement of light harvesting, charge separation, transportation and collection.
2.4. Charge transfer and energy transfer
The charge transfer behavior of the devices is discussed in terms of the photoluminescence (PL) quenching in the blend films. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the PL spectra of the PM6 neat film, binary blends and ternary blends were determined below 610 nm, while the PL spectra of the Y6 neat film, binary blends and ternary blends were determined below 680 nm. The PL spectra of binary and ternary blend films are quenched dramatically over 90%, which indicates that the charge transfer in all of the blend films was very effective.41 The PL spectra of BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr were also determined under 680 nm. As shown in Fig. 3c, there was substantial overlap between the emission spectra of BTIC-EH-2ThBr, BTIC-BO-2ThBr and the absorption spectrum of Y6, which was essential for the efficient energy transfer. In addition, the Förster radius (R0) from BTIC-EH-2ThBr to Y6 is in the range of effective transmission radius, according to published data.42–44 Therefore, the photon energy in the range of 600–800 nm can be captured by BTIC-EH-2ThBr and transferred to Y6 through the Förster energy transfer. The PL quenching in blend films confirms that the excitons in the blend films were fully utilized in the charge generation. For further verification, the PL spectra of neat Y6 and blend Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr (w/w = 0.9:0.1) and Y6:BTIC-BO-2ThBr (w/w = 0.9:0.1) films under 680 nm light excitation were measured (Fig. 3d). The emission intensity of the blend films was clearly enhanced and the PL emission peaks of BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr disappeared, which proved the existence of energy transfer from BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr to Y6. Simultaneously, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of neat Y6 and blend Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr and Y6:BTIC-BO-2ThBr films were measured, and are shown in Fig. 3e. The emission lifetimes under 680 nm of Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr (1.32 ns) and Y6:BTIC-BO-2ThBr (1.27 ns) were improved significantly after the addition of BTIC-EH-2ThBr or BTIC-BO-2ThBr, thus confirming the energy transfer. The extra absorber BTIC-EH-2ThBr can absorb additional photon energy and generate extra photogenerated excitons, while no free charge carriers are directly generated in this process. Correspondingly, these extra excitons will be transferred to Y6 to generate more free charge carriers.45 Long-range transport could be achieved by the energy transfer from BTIC-EH-2ThBr excitons to Y6 in this process, and the TRPL emission lifetime was improved. Broadened EQE spectra and enhanced JSC were obtained simultaneously in the ternary devices.

2.5. Voltage loss study
The addition of BTIC-EH-2ThBr or BTIC-BO-2ThBr to TOSCs increased the VOC to 0.853 and 0.851 eV, respectively, while the VOC of the PM6:Y6 based binary device was 0.840 eV. The energy loss (Eloss) of each of the devices was studied. Usually in organic solar cell devices, there is a large Eloss in the process of charge generation and recombination due to the intrinsic properties of organic semiconductor materials, which hinder the improvement of device performance. Eloss in OSCs consists of three components: (1) ΔE1 = Eg − VSQOC, SQ denotes the Shockley–Queisser limit. This is derived from the radiation recombination caused by absorption above the band gap, which is usually 0.25–0.30 V and is unavoidable; (2) ΔE2 = qVSQOC − qVradOC = qΔVradOC. This is additional radiative recombination caused by absorption below the bandgap; (3) ΔE3 = qVradOC − qVOC = −kTln(EQEEL). This represents the energy loss caused by nonradiative recombination, which is the main component of the Eloss in OSCs.46,47 The FTPS-EQE spectra and electroluminescence EQE spectrum (EQEEL) were measured and used to analyze the energy loss of the binary and ternary devices. The results are presented in Fig. 4 and Table S2.† The Eg of blend films was determined from the intersection between the normalized absorption and emission spectra of blend films. The values of ΔE1 were 0.255, 0.255 and 0.260 eV for PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr, and PM6:Y6:BTIC-BO-2ThBr, respectively. The three devices exhibited similar ΔE2 values of 0.071, 0.071 and 0.072 eV. The main difference of Eloss in the three devices is mainly derived from the ΔE3 values, which were 0.250, 0.231 and 0.236 for devices based on PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr, and PM6:Y6:BTIC-BO-2ThBr, respectively. Finally, the TOSCs yielded Eloss values of 0.557 and 0.567 eV, smaller than that of the binary device. In the perspective of energy loss, the introduction of the third component provides an effective strategy to reduce energy loss and improve VOC.

2.6. Morphology study
There is a significant difference in device performance between TOSCs based on BTIC-EH-2ThBr and those based on BTIC-BO-2ThBr, and to pursue this, we characterized the morphology of the active layer. Grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) analysis was carried out in an effort to understand the molecular packing, orientation and crystallinity in the films. The 2D-GIWAXS patterns of the neat Y6, BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr films, as well as the blend films are shown in Fig. 5a, and the corresponding line-cut scattering profiles in the out-of-plane (OP) and in-plane (IP) directions are in Fig. 5b. The typical face-on molecular orientation was found to be dominant in all the neat and blend films, which is favorable to charge transportation and collection.48,49 In the OP direction, neat films had characteristic π–π stacking peaks at 1.79, 1.77 and 1.84 Å−1 for Y6, BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr, and the π–π stacking distances (dπ–π) were 3.51, 3.55 and 3.41 Å−1, respectively. There were slight differences in the position of the π–π stacking peaks due to the minor modification of the molecular structure. For the Y6 film, a lamellar peak at 0.28 Å−1 (d = 22.43 Å) in the IP direction was observed and a definite and broad lamellar diffraction peak was found at 0.34 Å−1 (d = 18.5 Å) in the BTIC-EH-2ThBr film. Somewhat sharper lamellar diffraction peaks were seen at 0.23 Å−1 (d = 27.30 Å) and 0.30 Å−1 (d = 20.93 Å) in the BTIC-EH-2ThBr film. The neat BTIC-BO-2ThBr film exhibited more π–π stacking than the BTIC-EH-2ThBr film, and the larger crystal coherence length (CCL) in BTIC-BO-2ThBr implied a larger crystalline structure. For the blend films, crystalline structures similar to that of PM6:Y6 were seen in PM6:Y6:BTIC-BO-2ThBr. Addition of BTIC-EH-2ThBr brought obvious changes to the packing and crystalline structure of the blend film with the π–π stacking peak at 1.78 Å−1 (d = 3.53 Å) in the OP direction and the lamellar peak at 0.29Å−1 (d = 21.66 Å) in the IP direction. Compared to PM6:Y6, the ternary blend of PM6:Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr exhibited a slightly decreased CCL from 7.80 to 5.57 nm. The excessive aggregation and high crystallinity in PM6:Y6 and PM6:Y6:BTIC-BO-2ThBr blend films are not conducive to the formation of the optimal morphology,50 and the addition of BTIC-EH-2ThBr with lower crystallinity effectively alleviates the excessive accumulation in the PM6:Y6 blend film.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to analyse the surface morphology of the blend films, and the results are shown in Fig. S5.† The introduction of BTIC-EH-2ThBr efficiently reduced the root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of the blend films. The RMS surface roughness of the PM6:Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr blend film was 1.595 nm, and the RMS surface roughness values of PM6:Y6 and PM6:Y6:BTIC-BO-2ThBr blend films were 1.725 and 1.807 nm, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 5c) of the blend films exhibited the smallest domain sizes and optimal phase separation. From the GIWAXS results, this may be due to the weaker crystallinity of BTIC-EH-2ThBr which weakened the excessive molecular packing in the blend film. A more smooth and uniform surface morphology was achieved in the PM6:Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr blend film, and this facilitates the charge transportation in the devices. For the PM6:Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr based TOSC, the optimal morphology reduced the exciton recombination and increased the carrier mobility, accordingly facilitating the JSC and FF.
3 Conclusion
In conclusion, two medium band gap NFAs, BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr, with different side chains have been designed and synthesized. The neat films of BTIC-EH-2ThBr and BTIC-BO-2ThBr exhibit a maximum absorption peak at 718 nm, between those of PM6 and Y6. Their PL emission mostly overlapped with the absorption spectrum of Y6. The PL emission intensities of the Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr and Y6:BTIC-BO-2ThBr films increase with the addition of BTIC-EH-2ThBr or BTIC-BO-2ThBr, and consequently, the photoexcitation from acceptors increases significantly in the process of energy transfer from BTIC-EH-2ThBr or BTIC-BO-2ThBr to Y6. From the device perspective, enhanced EQE spectra with the increased JSC are achieved in TOSCs. In addition, the weaker crystallinity and molecular packing of BTIC-EH-2ThBr optimize the morphology of the PM6:Y6:BTIC-EH-2ThBr blend film, improve the compatibility among the three materials and acquire a better phase separation structure. Finally, a PCE of 17.54% is obtained with the enhanced photon harvesting, restricted recombination and elevated carrier transportation. This research suggests an effective strategy to improve photo utilization and the corresponding device performance by introducing a medium band gap NFA as an extra absorber for TOSCs.
