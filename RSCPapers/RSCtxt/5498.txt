    , Accepted 16th July 2021First published on 17th July 2021AbstractWhether Li–S batteries can be worked in a wider temperature range is particularly important. Here, we report micro/nanostructure CoFe2O4 rods combining both catalytic sites (Co) and adsorption sites (Fe). Under the synergistic enhancement of these two different sites, the conversion rate of polysulfides in Li–S batteries is greatly accelerated, and the “shuttle effect” is effectively suppressed. When used as the host material for Li–S batteries, the capacity, rate performance and cycling stability are promoted greatly. Most importantly, the cell achieves an excellent electrochemical performance at high temperatures. After 1000 cycles, the Li–S battery using CoFe2O4 nanorods as the cathode exhibits a high reversible capacity of about 700 mA h g−1 at a high temperature of 70 °C with a capacity attenuation of less than 0.02% per cycle. Meanwhile, the battery also shows excellent performance at −20 °C owing to the high catalytic activity.
With the development of the economy, society, and technology, there is an ever-growing demand for energy. Human beings are urgently developing new green energy sources such as wind energy, solar energy, tidal energy, and geothermal energy to replace the current energy supply system.1–3 However, the direct use of these natural energy sources is conditioned by the season, weather, and location, and thus development of efficient energy storage systems with high energy and power densities has become very urgent.4–8
Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising green energy storage devices based on the complex multi-electron reactions, which result in a theoretical capacity (1675 mA h g−1) much higher than those of traditional lithium-ion batteries.9–11 Due to high energy density, rich reserves, low price, and environmental friendliness, Li–S batteries have attracted wide attention for application in electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and portable electronics. Currently, the poor conductivity of sulfur and its discharge products, the “shuttle effect” of the lithium polysulfides which are produced in the charging and discharging processes, and electrode volume expansion restrict the applications of Li–S batteries.12–17 Fortunately, there has been a lot of research on solving these problems, which has achieved extremely good results recently.18–31
Most of these researches were focused on room temperature Li–S batteries; actually, the great majority of electronic equipment including EVs or HEVs need to work at a wider range of temperatures, especially at higher temperatures. For Li–S batteries, higher temperature means that the solubility of lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte increases, which will seriously aggravate the “shuttle effect” of polysulfide, leading to worse cycle life.32–34 One possible solution is to use host materials or membranes which have a greater ability to adsorb or separate the polysulfides. Lan et al. used TiO2@NiCo-LDH as the interlayers for Li–S batteries. The cell could retain a reversible capacity of 798.6 mA h g−1 at 1 C after 100 cycles at 60 °C.35 However, only increasing the adsorption ability for polysulfides in Li–S batteries is not enough to inhibit the polysulfide shuttle at high temperatures. It is also necessary to accelerate the speed of the lithium polysulfide conversion reaction so as to reduce the existence time of lithium polysulfides. Under the synergistic effect of these two functions, the “shuttle effect” at high temperature of polysulfides could be reduced to the maximum extent, thus improving the capacity and cycle life of Li–S batteries.
Herein, we report nanorod-like CoFe2O4 prepared based on an efficient and simple solvothermal approach, which is used as the host material with two different types of active sites for Li–S batteries. The Co active site with +2 valence state can accelerate the kinetic speed of the lithium polysulfide conversion reaction; meanwhile, the Fe active site with +3 valence state provides a strong adsorption capacity for lithium polysulfides. Compared to an ordinary host material, the synergistic effect of the two different types of active sites in CoFe2O4 greatly facilitates the reaction and inhibits the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides in Li–S batteries. Also, the special nanostructure of the CoFe2O4 nanorods can effectively alleviate the volume expansion during charge and discharge processes. As a result, a Li–S battery with CoFe2O4 nanorods as the host exhibits enhanced reversible capacity and cycling performance, especially at high temperatures. At a temperature of 70 °C, the capacity can be stabilized at about 700 mA h g−1 at 2 C after 1000 cycles with a capacity attenuation lower than 20% (0.02% per cycle). And at a low temperature of 0 °C, the cell also shows a reversible capacity of 705 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1 C.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the nanostructure of as-prepared samples. Fig. 1a shows a typical overall view of the CoFe2O4 sample before heat treatment. It shows that the sample has a uniform rod-like morphology and constitutes a flower-like structure. The higher-magnification image (Fig. 1b) shows that the nanorods are about 100–200 nm in diameter and have smooth surfaces. After a heat treatment at 700 °C, the basic morphology and size of the nanorods are preserved, except that the smooth surface becomes a smaller pile of secondary particles with a size of about 10–20 nm as shown in Fig. S1† and 1c. This is mainly due to the reaction of the organic part in the precursor after the calcination process to form CO2 and then volatilization, resulting in holes on the surface of the sample. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms also support this point of view. Fig. S2† shows that the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface area of CoFe2O4 is about 63.45 m2 g−1 and the pore volume is 0.289 cm3 g−1, which is relatively high for metal oxides not compounded with other carbon materials. The large pore volume and high specific surface area are beneficial to restrain electrode volume expansion. At the same time, they can provide more catalytic and adsorption sites for lithium polysulfides, thus improving the capacity and cycle life of Li–S batteries. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was also used to investigate the crystal structure of the CoFe2O4 sample after calcination. Significant diffraction peaks in Fig. 1d are observed at 18.23°, 30.01°, 35.44°, 37.05°, 43.05°, 53.44°, 56.97°, and 62.58° which are perfectly indexed to the (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511) and (440) planes of CoFe2O4 according to JCPDS no. 22-1086 with a face-centered cubic structure, indicating a high purity of the CoFe2O4 crystalline phase. The inset of Fig. 1c showing a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image also demonstrates the high crystallinity of CoFe2O4. The plane spacing of 0.251 nm corresponds to the (311) spacing of CoFe2O4. The energy dispersive spectrum in Fig. S3† shows the atomic ratio of Co and Fe in the sample is about 1:2, which matches the elemental ratio in CoFe2O4. And the electrical conductivity of CoFe2O4 nanorods is 8.7 × 10−2 S cm−1 measured with a powder resistivity tester (FT-02A).

Sublimated sulfur and CoFe2O4 sample were mixed and heated at 155 °C in a 3:1 ratio by weight. Then the content of sulfur in the CoFe2O4/S composite was about 74.2% as measured with TGA under nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S4†). The XRD results shown in Fig. S5† prove the presence of sulfur in the sample. The SEM image of the CoFe2O4/S composite (Fig. S6†) illustrates the surface of the nanorods is uniformly coated with sulfur. To evaluate the electrochemical properties of the CoFe2O4/S composite, it was applied as the cathode host for Li–S batteries, and was tested from 1.7 to 2.7 V versus Li/Li+ (see Fig. 2). Fig. 2a and b show the rate properties of CoFe2O4/S composite at different current densities and the corresponding charge/discharge curves. It is shown that at a current density of 0.1 C (1 C = 1680 mA h g−1), the discharge capacity of the cell is up to 1535 mA h g−1, which is equivalent to about 92% of the theoretical capacity of sulfur. The corresponding charge capacity is about 1531 mA h g−1, which is almost the same as the discharge capacity. This indicates that almost all products are oxidized into sulfur again during the charging process. The Coulomb efficiency of the first cycle with the CoFe2O4/S composite is as high as 99.7%, which shows that the electrode has a very high sulfur utilization rate during both charge and discharge processes. This is attributed to Co ions with an unsaturated +2 valence, which can effectively catalyze the conversion reaction of polysulfide, thus greatly improving the utilization rate of sulfur.29 With the current density increased to 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1 C and 2 C, the discharge capacity of the cell is 1383 mA h g−1, 1279 mA h g−1, 1045 mA h g−1 and 892 mA h g−1, respectively. Even when the rate is as high as 5 C (8.4 A g−1), the CoFe2O4/S electrode can still release a large capacity of 587 mA h g−1, which implies that the cell has excellent rate performance. When the current density returns to 0.1 C, a high reversible capacity of 1493 mA h g−1 is recovered, which is fairly close to the initial value.

(c and e) Charge and discharge capacity and coulombic efficiency versus cycle number at current densities of 1 C and 2 C. (d) Discharge capacity of Co3O4, CoFe2O4 and Sup P versus cycle number at a current density of 1 C. 
In addition to capacity and rate performance, cycling stability is also an important evaluation index for Li–S batteries. Fig. 2c shows that at 1 C, the cell with CoFe2O4/S electrode delivers a discharge capacity above 930 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. Moreover, Fig. 2e indicates an excellent cycling stability at high current densities of 2 C, the discharge capacity finally stabilizing at about 600 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles with a capacity attenuation of less than 0.03% per cycle. Co3O4 nanostructured materials (the characterization is shown in Fig. S7†) under the same test conditions were used in a comparison experiment. The cycling stability of Co3O4/S electrode is improved compared with those of carbon materials which have little chemisorption capacity for polysulfide. However, compared with CoFe2O4 material, the Co3O4/S electrode has a larger capacity attenuation in the initial few cycles, indicating that the replacement of cobalt ions with trivalent iron ions can enhance the adsorption capacity for polysulfide.
A visual discrimination experiment was used to intuitively prove the adsorption capacity of the CoFe2O4 sample for polysulfides, in which Li2S6 was used as the representative of lithium polysulfides. Equal amounts of Sup P, Co3O4, and CoFe2O4 nanorods were added to Li2S6 in DOL/DME solution with a concentration of 10 mM. Fig. 3 shows the excellent adsorption capacity of the CoFe2O4 nanorods, the orange solution becoming colorless after only minutes. The color of the solution with Co3O4 also gradually faded, but after 1 h, it still showed some color of orange, indicating that the adsorption capacity of Co3O4 for polysulfides is much weaker than that of CoFe2O4. This indicates that the adsorption of polysulfide in the sample is mainly attributed to the trivalent ions, and the adsorption capacity of +3 Fe ions is higher than that of +3 Co ions. After 6 h, both the solutions with Co3O4 and CoFe2O4 nanorods became colorless; in contrast, the color of the solution with sup P was almost unchanged. The same experiment was performed at a high temperature of 70 °C, where the color of the solution is lighter than at room temperature because the solubility of the polysulfide is increased at high temperatures. But at this time, even after 6 h, the Co3O4 solution did not turn colorless. In contrast, after only a short period of addition of CoFe2O4 nanorods, the polysulfide in the solution was adsorbed completely. This suggests that CoFe2O4 nanorods can effectively inhibit the “shuttle effect” in Li–S batteries over a wide temperature range.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the chemical interaction between lithium polysulfide and CoFe2O4 at different states of the cell in the discharge/charge process. Two pairs of distinct peaks are found at 797.0/803.4 eV and 781.1/787.6 eV for 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 of the Co element in the sample before discharge, respectively (as shown in Fig. 4a). Even after 100 cycles, the positions of the two pairs of peaks are almost unchanged, indicating that the electron transfer between Co and polysulfide is relatively weak. This indicates that the main role of Co in the CoFe2O4 sample is an effective catalytic site to promote the conversion reaction of lithium polysulfides,36,37 thus speeding up the reaction rate and improving the utilization rate of sulfur. Unlike for Co 2p, a new shoulder peak of Fe 2p is found in the XPS spectrum after cycling, which is mainly due to the chemical bonds formed between Fe and polysulfides. This illustrates that the Fe sites in CoFe2O4 act as adsorption centers to inhibit the “shuttle effect” of polysulfide, which is also consistent with the previous results of solution adsorption experiments.

Although Fe site has high adsorption ability for polysulfides, its weak catalytic activity limits the conversion of polysulfides. In contrast, Co site can realize the fast conversion of polysulfides, while the chemical binding of polysulfides on this site is much weaker than that on Fe site, which can be demonstrated by the XPS results shown in Fig. 4. In the CoFe2O4 nanorods, these two types of sites simultaneously exist, and, compared to the simple mixing of the two sites, the integration of the two sites in the same material has no interface problem and the distribution is more uniform. As a result, the Li polysulfides trapped on the Fe site quickly diffuse to the Co site and are then subjected to a conversion reaction, which achieves a smooth trapping diffusion–conversion of Li polysulfides.26,38 If there are solely Co or Fe adsorption sites, the adsorption capacity of Li polysulfides on these sites is the same, all sites will be occupied by adsorption at the initial time, and the smooth cycling process cannot occur. Thus, fast adsorption/conversion of Li polysulfides can be realized at the CoFe2O4 nanorods. The smooth trapping diffusion–conversion process produced by the synergistic effect of Co site and Fe site in CoFe2O4 sample can both speed up the conversion reaction and enhance the adsorption ability for polysulfides, which are very important for Li–S batteries to work properly in a wide temperature range.

Fig. 5 shows the performance of the CoFe2O4 nanorod host for Li–S battery at high temperatures, while the ordinary carbon host material Sup P is used for comparison. The charge/discharge curves in Fig. 5a show that the initial discharge capacities of both Sup P/S and CoFe2O4/S at 55 °C at 1 C have been increased to a certain extent, and the increase range of Sup P is higher than that of CoFe2O4. This is due to the higher temperature improving the conversion reaction rate of the Li–S battery. CoFe2O4 has a catalytic effect on the reaction of polysulfide at room temperature, so the effect on it of raising the temperature is not as obvious as that on Sup P. Cyclic stability is the most important evaluation index of whether a Li–S battery can work normally at high temperature. For the Sup P/S electrode, although the initial discharge capacity can be up to 1000 mA h g−1 at 1 C, the capacity remains less than 300 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, indicating a significant capacity fading rate of more than 70%. In contrast, the initial capacity of the CoFe2O4 electrode is about 1100 mA h g−1, but after 100 cycles, the capacity can still be more than 950 mA h g−1 with a capacity decay rate of only about 13%. Even when the temperature is raised to 70 °C, which can meet the service temperature requirements of most portable products, EVs or HEVs, the reversible capacity of the cell can still reach above 680 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 2 C. At this point, the capacity decay rate is less than 20%, equivalent to 0.02% per cycle. These results illustrate that after many cycles at large rate and high temperature, the CoFe2O4 nanorods used as the host material have an excellent cycling stability for Li–S batteries.

(b) Discharge and charge capacity of CoFe2O4 and Sup P versus cycle number at a current density of 1 C at 55 °C. (c) Charge and discharge capacity versus cycle number at a current density of 2 C at 70 °C. 
The reaction kinetics of Li–S batteries is greatly reduced at low temperature, which will lead to a decrease of sulfur utilization, especially at high current density. The effective catalysis of CoFe2O4 nanorods enables the cell to exhibit good performance even at a low temperature of 0 °C (Fig. 6). The CoFe2O4 electrode shows an initial cycle discharge capacity of 1370 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C. At a large rate of 1 C, after 100 cycles the reversible capacity of the cell could still reach 705 mA h g−1. By contrast, the cell with a Sup P electrode has 400 mA h g−1 capacity left, which is only about 60% of that of the CoFe2O4 electrode. At a temperature of −20 °C which can meet the low temperature requirements of most devices, the CoFe2O4/S cathode still exhibited improved electrochemical properties. It can liberate a capacity of above 500 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C after 50 cycles which is more than twice that of the Sup P/S cathode (as shown in Fig. S8†).

Conclusions
In summary, a simple and effective method of preparing CoFe2O4 nanorods has been introduced, which were then used as the host material for a Li–S battery. Due to the synergistic strengthening of the Co catalytic center and Fe adsorption center in the CoFe2O4 nanorods, the conversion reaction of polysulfides was accelerated on the one hand, and the adsorption effect of polysulfides was enhanced on the other hand. Therefore, the utilization rate of sulfur and cycling stability of the Li–S battery were greatly enhanced. The cell with CoFe2O4 nanorods showed a high initial discharge capacity of 1535 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C. After 100 cycles, a discharge capacity was delivered of above 930 mA h g−1 at 1 C. Even at a high temperature of 70 °C, the capacity of the cell with CoFe2O4 can be stabilized at about 700 mA h g−1 at 2 C after 1000 cycles. It also shows a reversible capacity of 705 mA h g−1 at 1 C after 100 cycles under a low temperature of 0 °C, which illustrates that the effective working temperature of the Li–S battery is widened to a range of −20 °C to 70 °C. This work provides a new idea for the selection of host materials in Li–S batteries with a wide temperature range.
