1. Introduction
Photodetectors (PDs) can detect optical signals by converting optical signals into electrical signals, and have been developed and applied in image sensing, artificial neural networks, optical communication, health care monitoring, military defense, etc.1–4 Semiconductors are the key functional layers of PDs, which can absorb incident light and generate carriers (electron and hole pairs).5 Under an external electric field, the electron and hole pairs are extracted and collected by the electrodes, and photocurrent will be generated. The absorption coefficient and exciton separation efficiency of semiconductors determine the performance of PDs. The commonly used semiconductor materials include inorganic materials, organic materials and organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.6 Inorganic materials include Ge, Si, and III–V compound semiconductors that have been fully investigated, but they are usually fabricated with high temperature, high vacuum, and high cost, which are restrictions for flexible large-area imaging systems.7 Organic materials have the advantages of solution processability, low cost and high mechanical flexibility, and have become promising candidates for PDs. Perovskite materials have the above advantages of organic materials and have become famous due to their large absorption coefficients, direct and adjustable bandgaps, ambipolar charge transport, large carrier mobilities and long carrier diffusion.8–13 In 2009, Kojima et al. first introduced the perovskite material methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) as a sensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%.14 Afterward, Park et al. adopted MAPbI3 nanoparticles as a light absorbing layer in solid-state mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with a PCE of over 9%.15 Since then, the PCE of perovskite solar cells has rapidly increased to a certified value of 25.5% during the past ten years.16 Besides solar cells, great progress has been made in photodetectors (PDs), light emitting diodes, optically pumped lasers and other optoelectronic devices.17–19 The remarkable optoelectronic properties and low temperature solution processability of halide perovskites make them a research hotspot for low-cost PDs with high performance.
Commonly, three-dimensional (3D) perovskites have a typical formula of ABX3 (Fig. 1a),20–22 where A represents a monovalent cation (MA+ = CH3NH3+; FA+ = CH(NH2)2+; Cs+), located at the eight corners of the cubic crystal; B is a divalent metal cation (Pb2+, Sn2+, Cu2+, Ge2+, or Mn2+), located at the centre of the body; and X is a monovalent halide anion (I−, Br− or Cl−), located at the six face centres. By changing the halide or cation composition of perovskites, the bandgap can be tuned, so that the absorption of the perovskites can be adjusted from the ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR) region (Fig. 1d).6,23 MAPbI3 perovskites with a bandgap of around 1.5 eV exhibit broad absorption spectra from 300 to 800 nm. Meanwhile, MAPbI3 perovskites have high absorption coefficients, which make them attractive as active layers in PDs. Using Br/Cl to replace the halide anion of I, the energy bandgap of MAPbBr3/MAPbCl3 perovskites can be adjusted to 2.2 and 2.88 eV.24–26 Using FA to replace the organic cation of MA, the energy bandgap of FAPbIyBr3−y perovskites can be adjusted down to 1.48 eV, with the absorption edges starting from 840 nm.27 A lead free MASnI3 perovskite has a narrow bandgap (1.2–1.4 eV) and an extended absorption spectrum to 950 nm.28 However, the excessively large size of the A cations can’t maintain the symmetry of the 3D perovskites. Big cations such as BA (C4H9NH3) and PEA (C6H5CH2CH2NH3) usually form 2D layer-structured perovskites with a chemical formula of (RNH3)2(MA)n−1BnX3n+1 (where R is a long carbon alkyl or aromatic moiety).29,30 The 3D cubic structures are sandwiched by 2D long chains through intermolecular forces; thus 2D perovskites generally present better resistance to moisture than 3D perovskites due to their long organic hydrophobic chains.31Fig. 1(b) shows different layered 2D perovskites BA2PbI4 (n = 1), BA2MAPb2I7 (n = 2) and BA2MA2Pb3I10 (n = 3). When n is equal to 1, the crystalline structure of BA2PbI4 turns out to be an ideal quantum well in which one inorganic layer is separated by one layer of organic chains. When n tends toward infinity, the structure approaches a 3D perovskite structure.32 3D and 2D perovskite films show excellent absorption and high device performance, while polycrystalline films present more grain boundaries and trap densities, and exhibit low carrier mobility. The grain boundaries of perovskites make it easy for them to decompose in water and oxygen environments, hindering their practical application in stable functional devices. Perovskite nanocrystals present fewer grain boundaries and low trap densities and demonstrate larger carrier mobility and higher stability in air. Perovskite nanocrystals include zero-dimensional (0D) spherical quantum dots, one-dimensional (1D) nanowires, and 2D nanoplatelets, which can be prepared via different fabrication methods.33,34Fig. 1c illustrates the formation process for different CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) nanocrystals; by adding various organic acid and amine ligands, the CsPbX3 nanocrystals can be transformed into spherical quantum dots, nanocubes or nanoplatelets with different mediators.34 CsPbX3 nanocrystals exhibit adjustable emission spectra in the entire visible spectrum. Perovskite nanocrystals can be dispersed in a mild organic solvent, which can be blended with organic materials that have better flexibility to fabricate hybrid PDs.

Major efforts have been devoted towards achieving high performance perovskite PDs, such as tuning the composition of perovskites, improving the perovskite film morphology, and combining perovskites with 2D layered semiconductors, organic semiconductors and other optoelectronic materials. To develop applications for perovskite detectors, a lot of work has been devoted to exploring the application of perovskite PDs in image sensing and artificial photonic synapses in the past five years.42,43 However, the applications of perovskite PDs in artificial photonic synapses have not been systematically summarized. This review intends to summarize the recent progress of perovskite PDs and their applications in photonic synapses, which are very important in information transfer, data storage and manufacture of artificial intelligence vision systems. First, the key performance parameters of PDs are briefly introduced. Second, the recent research progress of PDs including photoconductors, photodiodes, and phototransistors is summarized. Then, the applications of perovskite photodetectors in artificial photonic synapses in recent years are highlighted. Finally, current challenges and possible solutions of perovskite artificial photonic synapses are proposed.
2. The parameters of PDs
To evaluate the performance of PDs, several key parameters such as the spectral response region, responsivity, photosensitivity, external quantum efficiency, detectivity, and response speed have been proposed for practical applications.44 Many reviews have already introduced these parameters, and we only introduce the commonly used parameters.6
(1) The spectral response region represents the wavelength range that PDs can detect.
(2) Responsivity (R) refers to the ratio of the photocurrent generated by PDs to the intensity of the incident light under light illumination and is defined as follows:  where Il/Id is the ratio of the current measured under light to that in the dark, and Pin is the power of the incident light.
(3) Photosensitivity refers to the ratio of the photocurrent generated by PDs to the dark current of the PDs in the dark.  
(4) External quantum efficiency (EQE) refers to the ability of a PD to absorb, convert, and collect photo-generated charge carriers under incident light.  where h is Planck's constant, e is the electron charge, and v, c and λ are the frequency, velocity and wavelength of the incident light.
(5) Specific detectivity (D*) is used to evaluate the minimum detectable light power of a PD; in shot noise dominated devices like perovskite PDs, D* can be simplified.45,46  where A is the active area of a PD, Δf is the operation bandwidth, and in is the noise current.
(6) Response speed is the time it takes for the photocurrent to rise/fall from 10%/90% to 90%/10% of the maximum photocurrent of a PD under light pulses.47
3. Perovskite photodetectors
Perovskite PDs could be divided into photoconductors, photodiodes, and phototransistors according to their different working mechanisms as illustrated in Fig. 2. Photoconductors and phototransistors are lateral-type devices, while photodiodes are vertical-type devices. The common mechanism is based on the photoelectric effect, which means that perovskite active layers absorb incident photons with energy larger than the bandgap of the perovskites and subsequently generate electron–hole pairs. Then, the electrons and holes are separated and collected by the electrodes. To achieve high performance PDs, different structure PDs with various compositions of halide perovskites and perovskite heterojunction devices have been studied.

3.1 Perovskite photoconductors
Photoconductors are the simplest metal–semiconductor–metal configuration, including only perovskite absorbers and electrodes as shown in Fig. 2a. The devices are easily fabricated by depositing perovskite films on substrates with electrodes, or depositing perovskite films and symmetrical metal electrodes on a substrate. The photogenerated charge carriers are generated under light illumination, then directly dissociated into holes and electrons, and collected by the electrodes under bias, which usually results in large Iph, and high R and EQE (Fig. 2d).48 However, the longer distance between the electrodes (always greater than 1 μm) will lead to a longer carrier transport time, which always leads to slower response speed and requires a higher driving voltage. The recent research progress in perovskite photoconductors is summarized in Table 1.

In 2014, Hu et al. developed the first perovskite photoconductor using MAPbI3 material on flexible indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates, which has a broad spectrum from 250 to 800 nm.49 The device presented a high R of 3.49 A W−1 and an EQE of 1.19 × 103% at 365 nm. By adjusting the morphology, perovskite films with large crystal grains and high crystallinity can be obtained, which can reduce the boundary defects of the film, improve charge transfer and enhance the response speed of the photoconductors.60–62 By controlling perovskite crystallization, uniform and transparent MAPbI3 perovskite film networks were successfully synthesized on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). The fabricated MAPbI3 perovskite film network-based photoconductor exhibited a normalized D* of 1.02 × 1012 Hz1/2 W−1 (Jones).50 However, polycrystalline films have a large number of defects that lead to a slow response time. Perovskite single crystals are expected to achieve high performance perovskite PDs due to their large carrier mobility, fewer grain boundaries and low trap densities. Large area (1 cm2) MAPbBr3 single crystals were fabricated on ITO substrates with high crystallinity and exploited to build high performance PDs (Fig. 3a).51Fig. 3b displays the measured current–voltage (I–V) curves of the PD, revealing that photocurrent can be generated under light illumination. As the light intensity increases, the photocurrent increases. The MAPbBr3 photoconductor presented a remarkable R exceeding 4000 A W−1 and a superior D* exceeding 1013 Jones (Fig. 3c).

2D layered perovskite (BA)n(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 single crystals with different n values were grown from the water–air interface by Wang et al.52 They studied the photoresponse of (BA)n(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites with different quantum well thicknesses. Both the dark current and the photocurrent decreased as the n value decreased. And the quasi-2D perovskite BAPbI4 single crystal device exhibited a significantly low Id of 6 × 10−13 A, a big P value of about 104 and a fast response time of 1.7/3.9 μs. The 3D perovskite single crystal device exhibited a high R of 38 A W−1 and a superior D* of 1.6 × 1013 Jones among the 2D layered perovskites. The Sun group fabricated 2D perovskite (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnX3n+1 anisotropic micro-wire arrays using a template-confined growth method (Fig. 3d).53 By adjusting the space and length of the PDMS template and the concentration of the perovskite precursor, nanowire arrays with different lengths, heights and widths can be obtained. The PD with good crystalline quality and uniform perovskite micro-wire arrays exhibited an ultralow Id of 10−12 A, a high R of 3.5 A W−1 (Fig. 3e), a remarkable D* of 1 × 1015 Jones and a fast response time of 4.1/3.3 ms (Fig. 3f). Besides, the device was successfully applied for high-performance polarization detection. The Sun group further fabricated a MAPbBr3 microwire array with a length larger than 2 mm.17 Upon exposing the MAPbBr3 microwire PD to air for 340 days, the PD can still maintain 96% of the initial photocurrent, indicating that the MAPbBr3 microwire PD has excellent stability in air. Zhang et al. fabricated a 2D PEA2PbBr4 single crystal array with a large-size of about 200 mm2 by controlling the evaporation process.38 The UV photoconductor exhibited an extremely low Id of about 10−13 A, a large P value of about 105, a superior D* of 1.55 × 1013 Jones and a fast response time of 0.41/0.37 ms.
All-inorganic perovskites exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields, narrow half-peak widths, and good thermal stability and have attracted widespread attention.63,64 Liu et al. fabricated the first all-inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 nanoplatelet based photoconductor. The CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets have large lateral size, perfect crystallinity, no pinholes and superior stability. The CsPbBr3 nanoplatelet photoconductor showed a large R of 34 A W−1 and a superior D* of 7.5 × 1012 Jones.63 Porous single-walled carbon nanostructures such as nanotubes (p-SWCNT) were incorporated with CsPbBr3 nanocrystals which acted as the active layer of PDs.57 By introducing the p-SWCNT in the CsPbBr3 crystal based photoconductor, the charge mobility and mechanical stability were enhanced. The photoconductor showed a high R of 41.0 A W−1 with a specific D* of 1.67 × 1012 Jones. To increase the responsivity of photoconductors, large grain and high crystallinity α-CsPbI3 perovskite nanowire arrays were successfully fabricated using an asymmetric-wettability topographical template (Fig. 3g).55 To obtain a stable α-phase CsPbI3 perovskite, 10 wt% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was added to the perovskite precursor. PVP used as an additive can assist the growth of α-phase CsPbI3 nanowires with large grains and low trap densities.65 The CsPbI3 PDs exhibited a remarkable R of 1294 A W−1 (Fig. 3h), an excellent D* of 2.6 × 1014 Jones and a fast response time of 0.85/0.78 ms (Fig. 3i). Additionally, the PVP doped CsPbI3 PDs exhibited superior stability under light illumination, and the photocurrent could maintain 90% of the original value of the PD after 30 days, which presented long-term stability. New lead-free, all-inorganic and ambient stable perovskite CsBi3I10 films were synthesized.56 The CsBi3I10 photoconductor exhibited an obviously high R of 21.8 A W−1 and an excellent D* of 1.93 × 1013 Jones upon 650 nm light illumination.
Combining perovskites with narrow-bandgap NIR organic polymers can broaden the absorption spectra covering the UV-vis-NIR region. An organic polymer (poly(diketopyrrolopyrrole–terthiophene), PDPP3T) was combined with MAPbI3 to fabricate a photoconductor.59 The MAPbI3/PDPP3T heterojunction could facilitate carrier separation, and the Id of the hybrid PD was efficiently suppressed. The photoconductor achieved excellent responsivity in the UV-vis-NIR region with an R value of 0.15 A W−1 under 835 nm light. Besides, the device exhibited a peak D* of 8.8 × 1010 Jones at 835 nm. Additionally, the PDPP3T layer could protect the MAPbI3 film from the intrusion of O2 and H2O, thereby improving the stability of the device.
3.2. Perovskite photodiodes
Perovskite photodiodes are photovoltaic-type detectors as illustrated in Fig. 2b. The perovskite generated electron–hole pairs under light illumination, and electrons and holes are separated by the built-in electric field in the junction and collected by the electrodes, subsequently (Fig. 2e). Since the distance between the electrodes is determined by the active layers which is always lower than 1 μm, photodiodes always have fast response times compared to photoconductors and phototransistors. However, their responsivity and EQE are relatively low. The recent progress in perovskite photodiodes is summarized in Table 2.

For perovskite photodiodes, interfacial materials including hole transporting layers (HTLs) and electron transporting layers (ETLs) are always used to facilitate the separation and collection of charge carriers. Commonly used HTLs include organic polymer materials poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA), inorganic oxides NiOx, Al2O3, and MoO3, organic small molecules Spiro, etc. Commonly used ETLs include inorganic oxides TiOx, SnO2, and ZnO and small organic molecules [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), C60, etc.
Yang et al. first fabricated a perovskite photodiode adopting MAPbI3−xClx as a light absorbing material via a solution-process method as displayed in Fig. 4a.66 PEDOT:PSS was used as an HTL and PCBM was used as an ETL, which can facilitate charge extraction and improve photocurrent. However, the Id of the photodiode was very large because PCBM can’t block hole injection under reverse bias. BCP and PFN were selected as cathode buffer layers, which can block holes and extract electrons, and the devices were marked as PD2 and PD3. Both the PD2 and PD3 devices presented lower Id and higher detectivity than PD1, and PD3 exhibited the lowest Id and highest detectivity (Fig. 4b). Finally, the PD3 device presented a superior EQE of 80%, and an excellent D* of 1014 Jones with a fast response time of 180 ns (Fig. 4c). Shen et al. fabricated a PD using PTAA and C60 as the HTL and ETL via a solution process method.67 The hydrophobic PTAA was conducive to forming perovskites with large grains and fewer grain boundaries.83 The C60 has higher electron mobility than PC61BM, which can improve the electron extraction capability of the PD. 30 nm C60 can completely cover the perovskite layer and C60 plays an important role in reducing the surface traps of the perovskite film, resulting in a low dark current, a large D* of 7.8 × 1012 Jones and an ultrafast response time of 1 ns. Large size (up to millimeters) MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 thin single crystals were grown on PTAA to form vertically structured p–i–n photodiodes.68 The hydrophobic PTAA allows the perovskite solution to be spread out quickly on the plane, so that thin single crystals of the perovskite can grow with lateral dimensions ranging from hundreds of microns to several millimeters. Due to the fewer traps and no grain boundary of the thin single crystals, the corresponding PDs showed ultralow Id and a superior specific D* of 1.5 × 1013 Jones with a fast response time of 100 ns. Quasi-two-dimensional (Q-2D) perovskite PEA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 films were adopted to fabricate photodiodes as displayed in Fig. 4d.37 The Q-2D perovskite exhibited a better crystal phase and environmental stability than the MAPbI3 perovskite. When n = 1, the PEA2PbI4 perovskite photodiode presented the lowest Id as illustrated in Fig. 4e. When n = 60, the Q-2D perovskite photodiode exhibited a low dark current density of 1.76 × 10−7 A cm−2, an R of 0.53 A W−1 (Fig. 4f), and a high D* of 2.20 × 1012 Jones.

To achieve broadband detection, low optical bandgap FASnI3 or MASnI3 perovskites were blended with MAPbI3 perovskites as light absorbing layers. Li et al. fabricated a broadband spectral (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 perovskite photodiode.74 By adjusting the thickness of the perovskite films to 1000 nm, the (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 photodiode showed enlarged grains, a suppressed Id of 3.9 nA, a superior EQE of above 65% and a remarkable D* of 1.1 × 1012 Jones in the NIR region. Xu et al. employed the ascorbic acid (AA) antioxidant additive to fabricate a MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite; the perovskite film showed a broad absorption spectrum from 350 to 1000 nm.75 The excellent antioxidant property of the AA additive can facilitate perovskite film formation and suppress the Sn oxidation, thus improving the stability of perovskite PDs. Another effective strategy to broaden the absorption spectra is to combine low bandgap polymers with perovskites.81,84,85 An organic bulk heterojunction of PTB7-Th:F8IC was spin-coated on MAPbI3 to form a perovskite photodiode (Fig. 4g).82 The MAPbI3/PTB7-Th:F8IC film shows stronger broader absorption from 400 to 1000 nm, leading to an EQE covering the NIR region with a peak of 54% at 850 nm (Fig. 4h). Owing to the excellent electron mobility of F8IC and the matched energy levels of F8IC and the MAPbI3 perovskite, the PD realized effective charge separation and fast charge transport, thereby achieving an ultrafast response time of 5.6ns (Fig. 4i).
3.3. Perovskite phototransistors
A phototransistor is a field effect transistor (FET) in the dark as shown in Fig. 2c. The phototransistor can be turned on and off by applying a gate voltage to modulate the number of carriers in the channel. The off-state current of the phototransistor is usually relatively low in the dark. Under light, the perovskite generates electron–hole pairs; only one type of carrier can be modulated and can participate in channel conduction (Fig. 2f). The accumulated carriers can be swept from the source to drain under the applied gate voltage with low recombination; therefore, phototransistors usually show low Id, superior responsivity and outstanding detectivity. The recent research progress in perovskite phototransistors is summarized in Table 3.

Li et al. reported the first FET-type PD based on MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx perovskite films as displayed in Fig. 5a.86 The dark current of the perovskite transistor is as low as 10−10 A in the dark (Fig. 5b). And the transistor exhibited a large Id of about 0.1 mA and bipolar transfer characteristics. Therefore, the MAPbI3 phototransistor obtained a high R of 320 A W−1 with an ultrafast response time shorter than 10 ms (Fig. 5c). Chen et al. fabricated a 2D lead free, environmentally friendly PEA2SnI4 perovskite phototransistor via a one-step solution process method.87 The 2D PEA2SnI4 phototransistor also exhibited low Id due to the gate modulation; thus, a high photosensitivity of 1.6 × 104, an ultrahigh R of 1.9 × 104 A W−1 and a remarkable EQE value of 4.9 × 106% were obtained. Liu et al. prepared an air-stable FASnI3 film based phototransistor.88 The hydroxybenzene sulfonic acid additive was introduced with excess SnCl2 to prevent Sn2+ from oxidizing to Sn4+. The FASnI3 phototransistor presented broadband response from 300 to 1000 nm along with an excellent R of 1.1 × 105 A W−1 and a superior gain of 2 × 105%. Then a flexible phototransistor was successfully fabricated on a polyimide substrate and could work normally with a bending diameter of 16 mm.

2D materials graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs, e.g. MoS2) have ultrahigh charge carrier mobility and are attractive materials for applications in perovskite phototransistors, where the perovskite was adopted as a light absorption layer and graphene/MoS2 was used as a transport layer.104,105 Under light illumination, the perovskite generated holes and electrons; the electrons were transferred to graphene or MoS2, while holes were trapped in the perovskite film, leading to enhanced channel current that resulted in a pronounced photogating effect. Shao et al. reported a stable, high gain phototransistor using a graphene/(BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 heterojunction as displayed in Fig. 5d.103Fig. 5e illustrates the appropriate energy band alignment of the graphene/2D perovskite heterostructure which can promote the transmission of photogenerated electrons to graphene and the accumulation of photogenerated holes in the perovskite film, thereby producing a photogating effect. The graphene/2D perovskite PD achieved a superior R of about 105 A W−1 (Fig. 5f) and a short response time of about 200 ms. Wu et al. fabricated a 0D–2D CsPbI3−xBrx QD/MoS2 perovskite phototransistor.106 The photogating effect and the favorable energy band alignment of CsPbI3−xBrx/MoS2 can generate a large amount of channel carriers and facilitate photocarrier separation. The PD presented a high R and specific D* of 7.7 × 104 A W−1 and 5.6 × 1011 Jones, respectively.
Organic semiconductors (OSCs) have the advantages of solution processability, adjustable bandgaps, high mobility, and complementary absorption to perovskites, and are widely used in perovskite phototransistors. Chen et al. developed perovskite–organic phototransistors based on CsPbBr3 QDs and dinaphtho[2,3-b:2′,3′-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DNTT).91 DNTT was used as a charge transport layer, and CsPbBr3 QDs were used as a light absorbing layer. The gate effect of the transistor makes the detector have a low dark current in the dark and large photocurrent under light, resulting in a high on/off ratio of 8.1 × 104. The devices exhibited high R, D* and EQE values of 1.7 × 104 A W−1, 2.0 × 1014 Jones and 67000%, respectively. Other semiconductors including carbon nanotubes, metal oxide nanostructures, and colloidal quantum dots were also integrated with perovskite to form heterojunction phototransistors.90,97,107 Wei et al. fabricated a quasi-2D PEA2MA2Pb3I10/indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) heterostructure phototransistor as displayed in Fig. 5g. The heterostructure phototransistor presented low dark current and an obvious photogating effect, and achieved superior P values over 105 (Fig. 5h). Furthermore, the PD exhibited high R values larger than 105 A W−1 at 457 nm and a remarkable D* of 5.1 × 1016 Jones (Fig. 5i).90
4. Application of perovskite PDs in artificial photonic synapses
The human brain is the control center of the nervous system which contains about 1011 neurons connected by about 1015 synapses that have excellent computing capabilities, such as high parallelism, low power consumption, and fault tolerance, which can outperform in many computer tasks.108,109 Synapses are the junctions between adjacent neurons that are dedicated to signal transmission. The most important attribute of synapses is plasticity, which represents changes in synaptic weight that is responsible for learning and memory. Artificial synaptic devices that integrated information transmission and data storage can greatly enhance the calculation speed, which has attracted the widespread attention of researchers. Artificial synaptic devices can realize many synaptic functions, e.g. excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), short-term potentiation (STP, STP is a short-term memory of synaptic connections lasting a few minutes or less), long-term potentiation (LTP, LTP is a long-term memory lasting for several hours or long), spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), and spike-rate dependent plasticity (SRDP).110–112
Perovskite optoelectronic devices usually present significant hystereses, and are very precious for artificial synapses used to mimic habituation-based plasticity, sensory adaptation and artificial vision systems.113–116 In 2016, Xu et al. first demonstrated MAPbBr3 perovskites as active materials to realize synaptic functions using electrical stimuli.116 Then, perovskite memristors are developed to obtain various synaptic behaviors using electrical stimuli.117 However, electrical stimulation synaptic devices usually have fixed coupling coefficients and slower neural operation speed, which can’t further simulate the complex activities of real organisms.116,118,119 Besides, it's hard to realize the interconnection of multiple synaptic devices because of the need for additional electrodes to apply voltages at the same time. In contrast, light-stimulated synaptic devices have large bandwidths, low power consumption, and low crosstalk that can greatly increase the computing speed.107,120,121 Furthermore, photonic synaptic devices can also respond to electrical stimuli, which can realize the synergistic effect of light and electrical stimuli to achieve complex and outstanding multifunctional synaptic behaviors. So, many efforts have been made towards developing photonic synaptic devices.122–124 Perovskites have exotic advantages attributed to their large absorption coefficients, solution processability, charge trapping effects and a variety of material components, which are very suitable for fabricating photonic synaptic devices. The recent progress of perovskite photonic synaptic devices is summarized in Table 4.

Qian et al. first fabricated a flexible photonic synaptic device using 2D perovskite PEA2SnI4 as an active layer as shown in Fig. 6a.125 A light pulse spike was used as the presynaptic signal and the photocurrent generated by the PEA2SnI4 film was regarded as the postsynaptic current. Under the irradiation with the light spike, the photocurrent was increased, which means that EPSC was generated, and the intensity of the EPSC increased with the increase in light irradiation time (Fig. 6b). The mechanism of the phenomenon is that the PEA2SnI4 film generated electron–hole pairs under the light illumination, and Sn vacancies in the PEA2SnI4 film captured the electrons; therefore, holes were accumulated and resulted in EPSC (Fig. 6c). The EPSC triggered with ten light pulses was larger than that triggered with a single pulse, which can simulate biological excitatory synaptic STP (Fig. 6d). The EPSC gain (A10/A1) enhanced with the increase in frequency as shown in the inset of Fig. 6d, which indicated that the learning effect is enhanced as the learning frequency is increased. Sun et al. also fabricated a PEA2SnI4 photonic synaptic device to mimic synaptic behaviors (Fig. 6e).126Fig. 6f illustrates the normalized PSC of the device under different numbers of light spikes to emulate the LTP; the result suggested that the memory effect enhanced with the increase in the number of light stimulation cycles. The synaptic weight change (ΔW) is defined as (I2 − I1)/I1, where I1 and I2 refer to the measured PSCs before and 5 s after exposure to the light stimuli as displayed in the inset of Fig. 6g. The ΔW enhanced with the increase in the number of light pulses and hardly increased for light spikes over 800, revealing that the transition from STP to LTP was obtained.

Liu et al. first reported a photoresponsive transistor based on stable lead-free perovskites CsBi3I10/SWCNTs as displayed in Fig. 6h.107 The introduction of SWCNTs greatly promoted the dissociation and transmission of the photogenerated carriers; the PDs exhibited a superior R of 6.0 × 104 A W−1 and an excellent D* of 2.46 × 1014 Jones. The device can mimic PPF under two consecutive light pulses (Fig. 6i); the ΔPSC (A2) triggered by the second light spike is larger than the ΔPSC (A1) stimulated by the first light spike. The mechanism is that the device generated hole–electron pairs under the first light spike; electrons might be captured by the charge trap states of the carbon nanotubes, resulting in enhanced hole current A1; and electrons were slowly released by defects and recombined with holes in the dark. When the pulse interval (ΔT) is shorter than the carrier recombination time, A2 can be cumulatively enhanced by the residual photogenerated carriers triggered by the first light pulse. The PPF index is defined as PPF = A2/A1 × 100%. The PPF index increased with the decrease in ΔT (Fig. 6j), revealing that the learning effect increases as the learning frequency increases.
CsPbBr3 QDs have excellent light absorption capacity and can be prepared by a solution method. The solvent of CsPbBr3 QDs are usually orthogonal solvent of organic materials that can be prepared into perovskite-organic composite films, which are widely used in photonic synaptic devices. Wang et al. reported a photonic flash memory phototransistor using CsPbBr3 QDs and a pentacene heterostructure as illustrated in Fig. 7a.120Fig. 7b displays the photoprogrammable and electrically-erasable transfer curves of the phototransistor. In the dark, the transistor exhibited a P-type transfer curve. Under light programming, the CsPbBr3 QDs captured the electrons, and the excess holes caused the transfer curves to shift to the positive direction (Fig. 7c). With electrical erasing using a gate voltage, the trapped electrons released and recombined with holes, causing the curve to shift back to its initial state (Fig. 7d). The above results revealed that the photonic synaptic devices can be modulated using both light spikes and electrical stimulation. Fig. 7e illustrates that under the stimulation of a series of continuously enhanced intensity of photon pulses, the current values continue to increase. It is proved that the memory device changed from volatile to nonvolatile memory, revealing that the plasticity of the brain changed from short-term memory to long-term memory retention. Fig. 7f shows that the PPF ratio enhanced with the decrease in ΔT and increase in photonic pulse intensity, suggesting that the learning effect enhanced with the increased stimulation and frequency. With the continuous development of research, perovskite photonic synapses have achieved more and more synaptic functions. CsPbBr3 QDs were combined with poly(3,3-didodecylquarterthiophene) (PQT-12) OSCs to fabricate synaptic phototransistors (SPTs) by the Huang group (Fig. 7g).129 The SPTs can mimic some important synaptic behaviors, including EPSC, PPF, STP, LTP, etc.Fig. 7h shows the EPSC of the SPT stimulated with 30 light spikes. The thirtieth EPSC (A30) value is approximately three times that of the first EPSC (A1). And the EPSC gain (A30/A1) increased with the increase in the frequency of light pulses (Fig. 7i), which is close to a linear correlation, revealing that the photonic synapse can act as a dynamic high-pass filter for information transmission.

Ma et al. fabricated a two-terminal optoelectronic synaptic device as displayed in Fig. 8a.43 CsPbBr3 nanoplates (PNs) provided the excellent photoresponsivity of the optoelectronic synapses, and the PEDOT:PSS/CuSCN interface could capture and release charges, causing the conductance change of the device. The optoelectronic synapses could mimic several synaptic functions, and further realized the “learning-experience” behavior. The light with a fixed intensity of 6.7 mW cm−2 and an external voltage of 0.1 V/0.5 V were applied to study the optoelectronic interaction of the synaptic device. The conductance of the device was basically the same under the first light pulse, while the conductance of the device became larger with the larger external voltage pulse (Fig. 8b and c). The working mechanism may be that the bigger external voltage caused the charge generated by the CsPbBr3 PNs to be captured by the CuSCN film. The trapped charge in the CuSCN film can facilitate the second charge trapping process at the interface between the PEDOT:PSS and CuSCN layers, leading to a faster increase in device conductivity. As displayed in Fig. 8d, two light pulses and a 0.5 V voltage pulse were applied. Under the first light pulse, it takes 6.8 s for the conductance of the device to increase from 30 μs to 39 μs, while it only takes 1.6 s under the second light illumination. The above results reveal that the optoelectronic synaptic device can simulate the “learning-experience” behavior in biological synapses, and it takes less time to learn the same things again.136,137

Hao et al. reported a SPT adopted a poly[2,5-(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-diketopyrrolopyrrole-alt-5,5-(2,5-di(thien-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene)] (DPPDTT) and CsPbBr3 QD blended hybrid film as an active layers.130 Owing to the excellent hole mobility of DPPDTT and the superior photosensitivity of CsPbBr3 QDs, the SPT can realize synaptic functions at a low voltage with a low power consumption of 0.5 fJ per spike. Importantly, the SPT has the ability to receive and integrate multiple correlated presynaptic inputs into dynamic logic functions, which can promote information processing capability.138 Two light pulses with wavelengths of 450 and 500 nm were used as input signals (Fig. 8e). As illustrated in Fig. 8f, only when the two light signals were illuminated at the same time, the ΔEPSC was larger than the threshold (5 nA), suggesting that the device can successfully simulate the AND logic function (Fig. 8f). By increasing the light intensity, the ΔEPSC was all larger than 5 nA whether one or two light pulses were applied, indicating that the device can successfully simulate the OR logic function (Fig. 8g). Moreover, the SPT can imitate the human visual memory. The authors fabricated a 6 × 6 pixel SPT array; the four pixels in the middle were stimulated with 10 light spikes, and the others were excited with one light spike (Fig. 8h). The results revealed that the device can obtain longer memory under the stimulation with larger light intensity or more light pulses. And the colors of the image weakened gradually after light illumination, which can imitate the forgetting behavior that the things you learn will be forgotten after learning. Liu et al. reported a SPT based on CsPbBr3/6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)-pentacene (TIPS) with a structure of Si/SiO2/CsPbBr3/TIPS/Au.134 The SPT presented an ultralow dark current which could be stimulated with weak light pulses. Thus, the SPT exhibited an ultralow electrical power consumption of 0.076 pJ, which allowed it to work under weak light intensity, and further could promote the accuracy of the image.
Yang et al. demonstrated a flexible artificial synapse with a structure of ITO/SnO2/CsPbCl3/TAPC (4,4′-cyclohexylidenebis[N,N-bis(4-methylphenyl)benzenamine])/TAPC:MoO3/MoO3/Ag/MoO3 which can imitate two lights via dual-mode operation (Fig. 8i).127 CsPbCl3 was used as the UV absorption material, and TAPC (4,4′-cyclohexylidenebis[N,N-bis(4-methylphenyl)benzenamine]) was used as the HTL. SnO2 could capture the charge generated by the CsPbCl3 to produce synaptic behaviors. Furthermore, the TAPC:MoO3 films showed an absorption spectrum from the deep red to NIR, which allowed the devices to obtain deep red to NIR photoresponse. CsPbCl3 generated photocarriers under UV light and caused synaptic behaviors, which is ascribed to the capture and release of carriers at the interface of CsPbCl3 and SnO2, while the red light could not cause synaptic behavior, because CsPbCl3 couldn’t absorb red light (similar to CsPbCl3 in the dark) (Fig. 8j). Fig. 8k shows that under UV light spikes, the device generated photocurrent and the current was maintained for greater than 70 s. However, the current excited with red light couldn’t be maintained for a long time. Thus, a shape of the letter “L” was formed, which demonstrated that the device can mimic the biological visual memory function and distinguish UV (365 nm) and red light (665 nm). The synaptic device presented different responses to different lights, which can realize image detection and recognition.
Our group reported the first flexible 2D perovskite/organic heterojunction (PEA2SnI4/Y6) ambipolar SPT which can recognize visible and NIR light (Fig. 9a).132 Y6 can absorb NIR light from 700 nm to 1000 nm. Combining Y6 with PEA2SnI4 can broaden the absorption spectrum from visible to NIR light (Fig. 9b). Owing to the hole transport properties of PEA2SnI4 and the electron transport properties of Y6, the PEA2SnI4/Y6 SPT presented a balanced ambipolar transporting behavior as illustrated in Fig. 9c. And the ambipolar transmission feature enabled the SPT to work in dual-mode, which exhibited superior responsivity to visible and NIR light. Four colors of light were used to stimulate the SPT (Fig. 9d). The current of the SPT gradually decreased under red (visible) light spikes, evidencing that IPSC was generated (Fig. 9e). The current of the SPT gradually increased under NIR light, indicating that EPSC was generated (Fig. 9f). Fig. 9g illustrates the working mechanism of the SPT. PEA2SnI4 and Y6 films generated electron–hole pairs under visible light, electrons were trapped by the Sn vacancies in the PEA2SnI4 film, and holes recombined with the electrons in the channel, leading to a reduction in IDS. When the SPT was irradiated with NIR light (Fig. 9h), Y6 generated electron–hole pairs, the holes were bound to the PEA2SnI4/Y6 interface, and the increased electrons led to an increased IDS. Using the same power intensity of the four lights to irradiate the SPT, the SPT produced IPSCs with different amplitudes for red, green and blue light, and EPSC for NIR light; therefore, the colors of the lights could be distinguished (Fig. 9i). Furthermore, flexible SPT arrays were successfully fabricated and it is the first time that “G”, “o”, “o”, and “d” encoded with red/green/blue/NIR light was realized via dual-mode simulation of the learning process.

Multiple-input light-stimulated SPTs were fabricated with a structure of Si/SiO2/PVP:CsPbBr3 QDs/PVDT-10/Au as shown in Fig. 10a.131 In the SPTs, PDVT-10 was selected as an active layer, PVP:CsPbBr3 QDs were prepared as a floating gate, which can also act as a photosensitive layer. More important, the Pavlov classical conditioning experiment with dogs was first demonstrated using all-light stimulation using the SPTs. Fig. 10b illustrates the schematic of Pavlov's dog experiment. G1 spikes were used as food (unconditioned stimulus, US) to activate and emulate salivation (unconditioned response, UR), and G3 spikes were regarded as the bell (conditioned stimulus, CS) to activate and emulate a conditioned response (CR) (Fig. 10c). The salivation response current threshold (Ith) was set as 0.30 nA. As shown in Fig. 10d, the bell ring alone did not cause the dog's salivation at the beginning. The food alone can trigger salivation. When G1 and G3 spikes were applied alternately, the EPSC stimulated with the G3 spikes gradually increased, suggesting that the dog gradually learned to associate the ring with food. Finally, the EPSCs decayed to the initial state with the bell ring alone, indicating that the classical conditioning disappeared.139

A novel neuromorphic-photoelectric 0D CsPbBr3 QD/2D MoS2 heterojunction phototransistor with an ion gel electrolyte gate was proposed (Fig. 10e).133 CsPbBr3 QDs were used as light absorption layers and MoS2 semiconductors were used as carrier transport layers. The Pavlov classical conditioning experiment with dogs could also be demonstrated through the optical and electrical synergy approach, as shown in Fig. 10f. Initially, 10 continuous electrical pulses were applied as the bell stimuli, and 10 successive light pulses were applied as the food stimuli. After photoelectronic synergy training, the EPSC value was larger than the Ith, evidencing that an association behavior was established between the electrical bell and the photonic food. The EPSC amplitude and the retention time increased with increasing light pulse width, indicating that the relationship between the food and bell is significantly enhanced (Fig. 10g). Fig. 10h displays the 3D map of learning efficiency (ηL) as a function of training pulse width (Wp) and the number of bells after training (after Nbell). Fig. 10i exhibits the ηL as a function of the number of training pulses (NP) and after Nbell. The results suggest that the learning efficiency enhanced with increase in training time and training number, which can imitate the learning process of the brain.

Pradhan et al. demonstrated an ultrathin SPT using a graphene–perovskite QD (G–PQD) superstructure prepared by growing PQDs on a graphene lattice (Fig. 11a).99 The G–PQD phototransistor exhibited an excellent detectivity of 4.72 × 1015 Jones at 430 nm, which could ensure weak light detection. The G–PQD phototransistor could mimic basic photonic synaptic behavior, such as EPSC, PPF and LTD. As shown in Fig. 11b, the conductance increased with increasing light intensity. The PPF decreased with the increase in time interval as shown in Fig. 11c. The conductance increased under 20 presynaptic light pulses and could be sustained for 3000 s, indicating the nonvolatile synaptic plasticity of the SPT (Fig. 11d). Fig. 11e displays the facial recognition process with the assistance of machine learning. Each synaptic device can recognize the light intensity signal of a pixel of the input image and convert it into a post-synaptic current signal, and then all of the post-synaptic current signals were collected using a computer. The light intensity of each pixel could be restored according to the magnitude of the current signal of each pixel, and finally the facial features could be calculated and obtained. Fig. 11f shows the real image and the calculated image using the synaptic weight of the corresponding output neuron; it can be found that this synaptic device can capture features from the portraits and realize facial recognition well.
5. Conclusion and outlook
In this review, the recent progress of perovskite photodetectors and their application in artificial photonic synapses are summarized and discussed. Perovskite photoconductors can be easily fabricated, and the performance of the photoconductors can be improved by controlling the morphology of the perovskite. Single crystal or low-dimensional nanostructure perovskites have fewer grain boundaries and low trap densities that are expected to fabricate high performance photodetectors with high responsivity and high detectivity. For example, large grain, good crystallinity and stable α-CsPbI3 perovskite nanowire arrays were used as active layers to promote the responsivity of the device to 1294 A W−1 with a superior detectivity of 2.6 × 1014 Jones.65 For perovskite photodiodes, the preparation process of the devices is relatively complicated. The commonly used strategy is to modify the interface of the device to reduce the contact barrier, which can passivate traps at the interface, improve charge separation and extraction efficiency, suppress dark current, and obtain a fast response time. For instance, the hydrophobic PTAA is conducive to the growth of perovskites with large grains, and high mobility C60 can passivate the surface traps of perovskites and guarantee fast electron extraction, resulting in a low dark current and a fast response time of 1 ns.83 Perovskite phototransistors can effectively promote the separation of charge carriers by gate voltage modulation, which usually present low dark current and high responsivity. Both 2D perovskite PEA2SnI4 and 3D perovskite FASnI3 phototransistors can achieve remarkable responsivity values up to 1 × 104 A W−1. To further improve the responsivity and detectivity of photodetectors, high-mobility 2D materials (graphene, MoS2) or organic semiconductor materials are introduced to integrate with perovskites that produce the photogating effect and achieve high responsivity. In general, to realize a photodetector with wavelength selectivity, the bandgap of the perovskite can be tuned over a broad spectral range by adjusting the chemical composition. To obtain a broad spectral response range to the NIR region, narrow bandgap polymers are combined with perovskites. To improve the stability of 3D perovskite, all-inorganic perovskite, and quasi-2D perovskite detectors are developed. To reduce the toxicity of lead-based devices, many environmentally friendly lead-free perovskite materials have been developed.
Perovskite detectors have superior light responsivity, excellent detectivity, hysteresis characteristics and charge trapping effects that provide optical modulation of artificial photonic synapses. Current research on perovskite photonic synapses focuses on simulating the learning, forgetting, habit and visual memory behaviors of the human brain. The application of perovskite materials with different chemical compositions and structures in photonic synapses has been explored. Many synaptic functions have been realized, including EPSC, PPF, STP/LTP and STDP. Hao et al. reported a DPPDTT/CsPbBr3 QD SPT that realized the AND/OR logic function and can imitate human visual memory.130 He et al. reported a SPT with a structure of Si/SiO2/PVP:CsPbBr3 QDs/PVDT-10/Au, which certified the Pavlov classical conditioning experiment using all-light stimulation.131 Pradhan et al. demonstrated a graphene–perovskite ultrathin photonic synapse transistor, which can realize facial recognition.99 Our group developed a 2D perovskite/organic heterojunction (PEA2SnI4/Y6) ambipolar SPT which can work in dual-mode and realize the recognition of visible light and NIR light for the first time.132 However, perovskite photonic synapse devices still face huge challenges. (1) Most perovskite photonic synapse devices still have large power consumption and low processing efficiency. (2) There are fewer devices that can simulate light of different colors, and it is still a challenge to efficiently simulate NIR light. (3) Perovskite photonic synapses that can simulate weak light are very important to improve the recognition rate of images; however, there is still a lack of such devices to realize neuromorphic networks for image recognition. (4) It is difficult for a single perovskite photonic synaptic device to detect sensory information. To solve these problems, more synaptic devices with new materials and structures need to be explored. Combining perovskites with 2D materials, organic semiconductor materials, and other types of new materials can improve concurrent signal processing and realize more synaptic behaviors. It is necessary to design and integrate synaptic devices to process sensory information with large scale parallelism and ultralow energy consumption.
