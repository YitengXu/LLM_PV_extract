Relative to its fluorine substituted counterpart PBT-F, PBT-Cl has a simple synthetic procedure, slightly blue-shifted absorption spectrum, and lower-lying HOMO level. Importantly, the PSC based on PBT-Cl:IT-4F showed higher charge carrier mobility with a more balanced μh/μe ratio, weaker bimolecular recombination, and suppressed trap-assisted recombination than the PBT-F:IT-4F based device, leading to a significantly higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.60%. Notably, the high PCE of 11.60% was obtained from the PBT-Cl based device processed using m-xylene solvent. What is more, a PBT-Cl based semitransparent PSC demonstrated a promising PCE of 8.18%, with a high AVT of 31.7%.

Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been regarded as a promising photovoltaic technology due to their unique advantages of light weight, solution processability, flexibility, and large-area capability.1–3 Currently, realizing high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs is the top priority for their commercialization and industrialization. Intensive research has been conducted on photovoltaic material innovation to address this issue. Especially, the emergence of nonfullerene small molecule acceptors in recent years has significantly improved the PCE of PSCs.4–17 Since the PCE is proportional to the parameters open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF), developing high-performance PSCs should simultaneously maximize these three key parameters. With respect to highly efficient polymer donor materials, a low-lying HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) level is required for obtaining high Voc, a strong and broad absorption feature is essential for yielding high Jsc, and high and balanced charge carrier mobility and a favorable morphology of the active layer are critical for achieving high FF and Jsc. Regarding these molecular design criteria, many effective strategies have been developed to optimize the photovoltaic properties of polymer donor materials.18–25 Benefiting from the unique advantage of the fluorine atom in down-shifting energy levels, modulating aggregation morphologies, and enhancing interchain interactions of conjugated polymers, incorporating the fluorine atom in the molecular architecture has been regarded as an effective strategy to improve the photovoltaic properties of the resulting polymers.25–27 Nevertheless, incorporating fluorine atom in the molecular architecture is confronted with the challenge of difficult chemical synthesis, leading to the low product yield and high material costs in the fluorinated polymer preparation. As a congener of fluorine, chlorine has similar properties but an easier synthetic procedure in related materials synthesis, and thus the replacement of fluorine by chlorine in molecular design is a more efficient strategy to fine tune the photovoltaic performance of the resulting polymer donors.7,28–30 On the other hand, limited by the larger atomic radius and weaker electronegativity in comparison with the fluorine atom, it is still a challenge to design chlorinated polymer donors for obtaining better photovoltaic performance than that of their fluorinated counterparts.
To further understand the difference between chlorine and fluorine in tuning photovoltaic properties of photovoltaic materials and exploit the application of chlorine in high-performance polymer donor design, in this work, we designed and synthesized a chlorinated conjugated polymer (denoted as PBT-Cl, as shown in Fig. 1a) which demonstrates superior photovoltaic properties over its fluorinated counterpart PBT-F31 (Fig. 1a). Relative to PBT-F, PBT-Cl showed a slightly blue-shifted absorption spectrum and lower HOMO level. Importantly, the PBT-Cl:IT-4F blend demonstrated higher charge carrier mobility with a more balanced μh/μe ratio, weaker bimolecular recombination, and suppressed trap-assisted recombination than the PBT-F:IT-4F blend, which should be beneficial for achieving better photovoltaic performance. As expected, the PBT-Cl based PSC device yielded a high PCE of 11.60%, which is 1.27 times higher than that of the PBT-F based device (PCE = 9.14%). Notably, a PCE as high as 11.60% was also obtained from the PBT-Cl based PSC device processed by a nonhalogen solvent, m-xylene (m-XY). What is more, a PBT-Cl based ST-PSC device demonstrated a promising PCE of 8.18%, with a high average visible transmittance (AVT, calculated from 370 to 740 nm) of 31.7%. The results demonstrate the great potential of the chlorine atom in tuning the photovoltaic performance of polymer donors for realizing highly efficient PSCs.

Results and discussion
Materials synthesis and physicochemical properties
The chemical structures of PBT-F and PBT-Cl are shown in Fig. 1a. PBT-F (Mn = 14.7 kDa, PDI = 1.83) was reported in our previous work.31 PBT-Cl was prepared by Stille-coupling polymerization using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. The detailed synthetic procedures toward PBT-Cl are described in the ESI.† PBT-Cl could be readily dissolved in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB), and m-XY. The high temperature gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) measurement result revealed that a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 15.3 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.74 was estimated for PBT-Cl by using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 160 °C.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PBT-Cl in CB solution and thin film are shown in Fig. 1b. PBT-Cl solution shows a strong absorption spectrum in the wavelength range of 480–700 nm, with a maximum absorption peak at 578 nm. The absorption profile of PBT-Cl in dilute solution is nearly the same as that in thin film, indicating small polymer aggregates in solution. This can be confirmed by measuring temperature-dependent absorption spectra of PBT-Cl in solution. As shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI,† the absorption edges of PBT-Cl gradually blue-shifted from 690 to 657 nm as the temperature elevated from 20 to 100 °C, indicating that the polymer solution changed to a disaggregated state at high temperature. In comparison with PBT-F (Eg = 1.77 eV), the PBT-Cl thin film exhibited an unidentified shoulder peak at long wavelength and a blue-shifted absorption spectrum with a larger optical bandgap (Eg) of 1.78 eV, suggesting that the chlorination of the BDT unit causes stronger steric hindrance and poorer polymeric backbone conformation. This is confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. As depicted in Fig. 1c (left), PBT-Cl has larger dihedral angels θ1 and θ2 (θ1 = 53.52°, θ2 = 22.53°) than PBT-F (θ1 = 52.85°, θ2 = 6.85°),31 indicating a more twisted backbone conformation of PBT-Cl which should result in the blue-shifted absorption spectrum.
The energy levels of PBT-Cl were measured by cyclic voltammetry. As shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) level calculated from the reduction potential (φred) is −3.60 eV, while the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) level calculated from the onset oxidation potential (φox) is −5.51 eV, which is 0.12 eV lower than that of PBT-F (HOMO = −5.39 eV, Fig. 1d). The energy levels of PBT-Cl obtained from the DFT calculation are shown in Fig. 1c; the HOMO level of PBT-Cl was calculated to be −5.01 eV, which is lower than that of PBT-F (HOMO = −4.89 eV).31 The results indicate that the chlorine atom has a more positive effect in down-shifting the HOMO level than the fluorine atom in this case.
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of PBT-Cl were investigated by fabricating PSC devices with the conventional architecture of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBT-Cl:IT-4F/PDINO/Al, where IT-4F5 and PDINO32 (as shown in Scheme S1 in ESI†) were used as the acceptor material and cathode interlayer, respectively. The PBT-Cl based PSC devices were optimized by scanning different donor/acceptor (D/A) ratios (Table S1 in ESI†) and post-treatment (Table S2 in ESI†). The optimal conditions are a ratio of 1:1.5 (w/w) and using 1% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the solvent additive, followed by thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min. The key parameters of the optimal PBT-Cl based devices are shown in Table 1, and the corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices are plotted in Fig. 2a. In comparison with the PBT-F based device, the device based on PBT-Cl processed by CB solvent showed nearly the same Voc value of ∼0.78 V and a similarly high Jsc of ∼21 mA cm−2 but a much higher FF of 0.70, leading to a significantly improved PCE of 11.60%. Although the HOMO level of PBT-Cl is lower than that of PBT-F, the PBT-Cl based devices showed similar Voc values to those of the devices based on PTB-F. This is mainly due to the fact that the Voc of a PSC device also depends on the morphology of the active layer besides the HOMO level of the donor material.33 The results demonstrate that the replacement of the fluorine atom in PBT-F with the chlorine atom is an efficient strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance of the resulting polymer. In addition, when nonhalogen solvent m-XY was employed to fabricate the PBT-Cl based PSC devices, a PCE of as high as 11.60% was also achieved, with a lower FF of 0.662, but a higher Jsc of 22.65 mA cm−2 compared to the device cast from CB solvent. It is well-known that m-XY has lower toxicity and a more environmentally friendly nature than CB solvent. Therefore, such an excellent photovoltaic performance achieved from the PBT-Cl based devices processed by m-XY indicates the promising capability of PBT-Cl for future PSC application.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimal PBT-Cl based devices cast from CB and m-XY are shown in Fig. 2b. The EQE curves of the two optimal devices cover a broad wavelength range from 400 to 750 nm, and the m-XY based device showed higher EQE than the device cast from CB solvent, corresponding to the higher Jsc value. The integral Jsc values of the two devices calculated from the EQE curves are rather consistent with the values obtained from the J–V measurements (within 8% mismatch).
Furthermore, the photovoltaic performance of PBT-Cl in semitransparent PSCs (ST-PSCs) was investigated by fabricating the devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBT-Cl:IT-4F/PDINO/Au (1 nm)/Ag which used m-XY as the processing solvent. Ag electrodes with thicknesses of 10, 15, and 20 nm were fabricated for the devices to balance the trade-off between transparency and efficiency. The key parameters of the ST-PSCs are collected in Table 2 and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3a. A moderate PCE of 6.06% was obtained from the ST-PSC with 10 nm Ag electrode thickness, with a high average visible transmittance (AVT, calculated from 370 to 740 nm) of 34.2% (Fig. 3b). When the Ag electrode thickness increased to 15 nm, a higher Jsc of 17.79 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.599 were obtained, delivering a higher PCE of 8.07%. Encouragingly, the ST-PSC with 20 nm Ag electrode thickness demonstrated a promising PCE of 8.18% and a high AVT of 31.7% (Fig. 3b), suggesting the great potential of PBT-Cl in highly efficient ST-PSC applications. Fig. 3c shows the photographs of the PBT-Cl based ST-PSCs with a 20 nm Ag cathode, the background pattern can be clearly seen through the semitransparent device. The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) 1931 chromaticity diagram was employed to further investigate the transparency color perception of the PBT-Cl based ST-PSCs. As depicted in Fig. 3d, the PBT-Cl based ST-PSC with a 20 nm thick Ag cathode has color coordinates of (0.240, 0.272) and a high color rendering index (CRI) of 88, indicating accurate color rendering when the illumination is through the PBT-Cl based ST-PSC device.34,35

Charge transport properties and recombination mechanisms
The charge carrier mobilities of the blend film were evaluated by space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement. As plotted in Fig. S3,† the pristine PBT-Cl film exhibited a high hole mobility of 2.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. In comparison with the PBT-F:IT-4F (1:1.5, w/w) blend, both higher hole and electron mobilities associated with a more balanced μh/μe of 1.15 were obtained from the PBT-Cl:IT-4F (1:1.5, w/w) blend (Table 3), which should be favorable for improving charge transportation and reducing charge recombination, giving rise to the higher FF of the PBT-Cl based device. The charge recombination mechanism of the blend film was studied by measuring the dependence of Jsc values on light intensity (Plight) (in the range from 2 to 100 mW cm−2), which can be described by the formula Jsc ∝ Plightα, where α is the recombination parameter implying the degree of bimolecular recombination.36 As shown in Fig. 4a, the α value was fitted to 0.951 for the PBT-Cl based device, which is much closer to 1 than that of the PBT-F based device (α = 0.896). The α value closer to 1 suggests the weaker bimolecular recombination in the PBT-Cl:IT-4F blend and the free charges of the PTB-Cl based device can be extracted more efficiently. Furthermore, the trap-assisted recombination of the PBT-Cl based device was investigated by plotting the Voc values versus logarithmic dependence of Plight (Voc ∝ lnPlight).37 In comparison with the PBT-F:IT-4F based device (slope = 1.53 kT/q), a lower slope of 1.342 kT/q was fitted for the PBT-Cl:IT-4F based device (Fig. 4b), suggesting that the Shockley–Read–Hall or trap-assisted recombination in the PBT-Cl:IT-4F based device was more effectively suppressed. Relative to the devices based on PBT-F, the combination of higher charge carrier mobility with a more balanced μh/μe ratio, weaker bimolecular recombination, and suppressed trap-assisted recombination of the devices based on PBT-Cl should result in higher FF values.

Morphology analysis
The molecular packing and crystallization of the pristine film and PBT-Cl:IT-4F (1:1.5, w/w) blend were investigated using 2D grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) measurements. As shown in Fig. 5a, the neat PBT-Cl film exhibited a strong (100) diffraction peak in in-plane (IP) at 0.387 Å−1 and a clear (010) diffraction peak in out-of-plane (OOP) at 1.52 Å−1. High intensity lamellar stacking (100) diffraction peaks of the PBT-Cl:IT-4F (1:1.5, w/w) blend were observed both in IP and OOP directions. Importantly, a clear (010) peak was observed in the OOP direction in the PBT-Cl:IT-4F blend, indicating the preferential face-on orientation which is beneficial for efficient charge transport in the vertical direction across the electrodes for PSCs. In comparison with the PBT-F:IT-4F blend,31 the PBT-Cl:IT-4F showed a more ordered molecular packing and preferential face-on orientation which should be favorable for charge carrier transport, delivering a reasonable explanation for both higher μh and μe in the PBT-Cl:IT-4F blend.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement was carried out to characterize the surface morphology of the active layer. As shown in Fig. 5b, the PBT-Cl:IT-4F blend showed a rather uniform and smooth surface with a root-mean-square-roughness (Rq) of 1.11 nm, implying the good miscibility of PBT-Cl with IT-4F. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement was performed to further investigate the bulk morphology of the blend film. The PBT-Cl:IT-4F (1:1.5, w/w) blend exhibited clear and defined nanoscale phase separation and a well-defined interpenetrating network morphology (Fig. 5c), which should be beneficial for charge transportation and thus high photovoltaic performance.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we developed a new chlorine substituted BDT based conjugated polymer, PBT-Cl, as the donor material for PSCs. In comparison with its fluorinated counterpart PBT-F, PBT-Cl possesses an easy and simple synthetic procedure, a slightly blue-shifted absorption spectrum, and a lower-lying HOMO level. Importantly, the PBT-Cl:IT-4F based device showed higher charge carrier mobility with a more balanced μh/μe ratio, weaker bimolecular recombination, and suppressed trap-assisted recombination than the PBT-F:IT-4F based device, leading to the overall improved photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 11.60%. Notably, a PCE as high as 11.60% was also obtained from the PBT-Cl based device processed by m-XY solvent. What is more, a PBT-Cl based ST-PSC device demonstrated a promising PCE of 8.18%, with a high AVT of 31.7%. The results demonstrate the great potential of chlorine substitution in tuning the photovoltaic performance of the polymer donors for realizing highly efficient PSCs.
