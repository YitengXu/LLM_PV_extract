    , Accepted 19th February 2022First published on 8th March 2022AbstractPerovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are promising interface modification materials for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, due to the limitation of the preparation method, it is hard to use PQDs as substrates for the growth of perovskite films by the common solution process. In this work, by introducing the rare earth element Ce into PQDs with the vacuum freezing and drying technology, we have successfully improved the solvent stability of PQDs. Moreover, we propose a technology, PQD dynamically mediated growth of perovskite film (PDMG), to prepare high-quality perovskite films, which can avoid the formation of PQD charge-blocking layers. Thanks to the improvement of perovskite crystallinity and the charge transport ability, the PCE is improved from 10.44% to 12.14% for CsPbI2Br PSCs and from 14.43% to 16.38% for CsPbI3 PSCs. Our work opens an avenue for using PQDs as substrates in the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs), as one of the most quickly developed photovoltaic technologies, have attracted much attention due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low cost. Up to now, the highest PCE (∼25.5%) has been achieved using organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials.1,2 However, the thermal stability of organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs is poor due to the volatile nature of organic components.3–5 Under such circumstances, all-inorganic perovskite materials were explored in order to solve the stability problem of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.6,7 One promising example of all-inorganic perovskites is CsPbI2Br, in which the inorganic cesium ions (Cs+) replaced the volatile organic cations of the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite, and thus exhibited superior thermal- and photo-stability.8,9 Further, P3HT was selected as the hole transport material (HTM) to replace the most commonly used spiro-OMeTAD for effectively improving the stability of the whole device.10 Apart from being applied in traditional solar cells, CsPbI2Br also shows great potential in semitransparent, flexible, large-area devices.11,12
However, compared with organic–inorganic hybrid PCSs, P3HT-based CsPbI2Br PSCs show a relatively low PCE.13–15 The band gap of CsPbI2Br is about 1.92 eV, which is too large to achieve a good match of the energy levels with the adjacent transport layers.16 Meanwhile, due to bromine doping, the crystalline quality of the perovskite film is relatively low and thus the defects are easily formed.17,18 The defects cause non-radiative recombination, charge trapping, ion migration and material degradation, and thus lead to a decrease of the PCE.19 To overcome these disadvantages, interface engineering is a good strategy.20,21 The interface modification materials can be perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), which have the same chemical compositions as perovskite active layers. Such PQDs as interface modification materials have shown great potential in passivating the defects, promoting the carrier transport and increasing the device stability.22–25
PQDs can be introduced into interfaces via the direct spin-coating or anti-solvent process. For example, Guo et al. (2019) directly overspread CsPbIBr2-alloy QDs over the CsPbIBr2 layer and successfully improved the PCE as well as the stability of the device.26 Zheng et al. (2019) dissolved CsPbBr2Cl QDs in an anti-solvent to wash the MAPbI3 perovskite layer surface to optimize the inverted PSCs.27 MAPbI3 films treated with QDs exhibited a reduction in tail states, a smaller trap-state density and an increase in carrier recombination lifetime. Despite these positive effects of PQD surface passivators, the PQDs are easily accumulated to form a capping layer to block the charge transport.28 Therefore, in some reports, PQDs were used as the precursor additive in the solution method to avoid their accumulation. Xie et al. (2019) prepared a FAPbI3-based perovskite precursor solution with CsPbBr3 clusters. The CsPbBr3 clusters could act as nuclei to facilitate the vertical growth of the α-FAPbI3 perovskite and thus leads to better crystalline quality.29
Actually, another feasible strategy of utilizing PQDs to prepare PSCs is to use them as the substrate material. Under such conditions, the advantages of PQDs to promote perovskite crystallization and passivate interfacial defects can be simultaneously utilized. However, due to the limitation of the preparation method, PQDs prefer to decompose immediately when contacting with the perovskite precursor. Hence forming a high-quality perovskite film on the PQD substrate by the common solution process is hard. Finding a feasible method to successfully use PQDs as substrates in the low-cost solution process of PSCs is still challenging.
In this work, we propose a promising strategy for using PQDs as substrates in solution process. Herein, the rare earth element Ce was doped into PQDs via the vacuum freezing and drying technology to improve the solvent stability of PQDs. In addition, the PQD dynamically mediated growth of perovskite film (PDMG) was performed to prepare the high-quality perovskite film. PQDs have multiple functions in this strategy: (1) in the initial stage, the PQDs first act as interfacial nucleation centers to induce perovskite crystallization; (2) in the later stage, PQDs decompose into ionic products to diffuse into the perovskite film for passivating the intrinsic defects of the perovskite; (3) the PQDs can also passivate the surface defects of the electron transport layer so that the charge extraction/transport performance is improved. Due to these advantages, the PCE exhibits a remarkable improvement of 16.28% for the CsPbI2Br PSC and 13.5% for the CsPbI3 PSC with the structure of FTO/TiO2/Perovskite/P3HT/Ag via the PDMG process relative to the corresponding reference devices without the PDMG process. Our work opens up an avenue for high-efficiency PSCs using PQDs as substrates.
2. Experimental procedures
2.1 Materials
Cesium iodide (CsI; 99.99%), lead bromide (PbBr2), lead iodide (PbI2) and HPbI3 were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%), 1-octadecene (ODE), chlorobenzene (CB; 99.8%), cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3), and ethyl acetate (EA) were purchased from Aladdin. Ti(IV) bis(ethyl acetoacetate)diisopropoxide was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Oleylamine (OAm) and oleic acid (OA) were purchased from Macklin.
2.2 Synthesis and purification of CsPbI3:Ce QDs
PQDs were synthesized by a modified hot injection method. Typically, a certain amount of CeI3 was mixed with PbI2, corresponding to the dopant ratios of 0, 5%, 10%, and 15% (mass ratio), respectively. Then the mixture was loaded into a three-necked flask with 10 mL ODE, 1 mL OA and 1 mL OAm and dried under a N2 flow. The mixture solution was heated and stirred at 120 °C for 1 h. After the temperature of the mixture solution was increased to 150 °C for 10 min, 0.8 mL Cs-oleate was quickly injected and kept for 10 s. Then the reactant was cooled down in ice water. The as-synthesized PQDs were purified by centrifuging the solution at 8000 rpm for 5 min. After discarding the supernatant solution, the resultant PQDs were further treated at 4 °C under vacuum conditions for 12 h to freeze-dry. Finally, Ce-doped CsPbI3 QD powder was obtained.
2.3 Device fabrication
TiO2 films as the electron transport layer (ETL) were prepared by spin-coating a 0.2 M Ti(IV) bis(ethyl acetoacetate)diisopropoxide solution in 1-butanol on FTO glass at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then annealing at 450 °C in a muffle furnace for 60 min with a 2 °C s−1 heating rate. For the PGDM process, the PQD solutions were spin-coated onto the FTO/c-TiO2 substrate at 1000 rpm for 30 s. Then the substrate was immersed in EA and then annealed at 125 °C for 5 min. After cooling to room temperature, the substrate was rotated at 8000 rpm for 30 s. In the last 10 s of the rotating process, 20 μL of DMF was dropped onto the PQD film. For the CsPbI2Br-based device, 0.5 M CsPbI2Br perovskite solution was spin-coated onto the PQD substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 70 °C for 5 min, 140 °C for 3 min and 160 °C for 10 min successively. For the CsPbI3-based device, 0.6 M CsPbI3 perovskite solution was spin-coated onto the PQD substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 70 °C for 3 min and 180 °C for 15 min successively. The hole transport layer was prepared by spin-coating the P3HT solution with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 125 °C for 5 min. The whole process was performed in a N2 atmosphere. At last, a 100 nm thick Ag layer was deposited by thermal evaporation.
2.4 Measurement and characterization
The surface morphology of the films was characterized by SEM (JEOL JSM-6340, Japan). The AFM images were obtained using an NX10 atomic force microscope from Park Systems equipped with a scanning Kelvin probe microscope. The steady-state PL spectra and TRPL were measured using an FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments) under the excitation of a xenon lamp of 470 nm and a nanosecond pulsed laser of 376.2 nm. The absorption spectra were measured using a Shimadzu UV-2600. The XRD patterns were taken using a Bruker QUANTAX 200 diffractometer. The J–V measurements of PSCs were performed on a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of an AM 1.5 G at 100 mW cm−2 irradiance, which is generated by a SAN-EIELECTRIC XES-40S2-CE solar simulator. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of PSCs was measured using a power source (ZOLIX CSC1011) with a monochromator and a source meter.
3. Results and discussion
In order to modify traditional CsPbI3 QDs, PQDs doped with cerium (CsPbI3:Ce QDs) were prepared by a modified thermal injection method via the vacuum freezing and drying technology. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of CsPbI3:Cex QDs (x = 0, 5%, 10%, and 15%, mass ratio). The CsPbI3:Cex QDs have an average particle size of 6.63 nm, 6.32 nm, 5.80 nm, and 5.72 nm, respectively. With increasing the doping ratio of Ce, the QD size decreases gradually. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the crystal plane spacing values of CsPbI3:Cex (x = 0, 5%, 10%, and 15%) QDs are 0.0317 nm, 0.0306 nm, 0.0309 nm, and 0.0315 nm, respectively, which decline slightly and then increase, but all the Ce-doped CsPbI3 QDs have a smaller crystal plane spacing than pure CsPbI3 QDs. It can be understood that a small amount of Ce ions could replace Pb ions and thus cause the shrinkage of the lattice,30 while the introduction of excessive Ce ions into the PQD crystal structure could cause lattice expansion and thus result in an unstable crystal structure.
Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the photograph of CsPbI3:Cex QD octane solution under a 365 nm UV lamp. It can be seen that the color of QDs changes slightly, which is mainly attributed to the change of the quantum dot size. Fig. 1(a) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of QDs. No shift of main peaks was observed and hence it can be deduced that the CsPbI3:Cex QDs have a similar cubic structure to CsPbI3 (Pm3m space group). The XRD pattern of CsPbI3:Ce10% QDs obviously exhibits the highest diffraction intensity, indicating that they have better crystallinity as compared to the other PQDs. Fig. 1(b) shows the normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CsPbI3:Cex QDs in octane solution. The PL peaks shift from 694 nm to 665 nm with the increase of Ce ion concentration, which also approved the decreasing size of the QDs.31 In the UV-vis absorbance spectra (Fig. S4, ESI†), the absorption edge shifts to shorter wavelengths gradually from 691 nm to 684 nm with the increase of Ce ion concentration, which is consistent with the results of PL spectra.

The thermal stability test of PQDs in octane solution was performed at 125 °C, and the results are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). After heating for 15 h, CsPbI3:Ce10% QDs still emitted distinct orange-red light under a 365 nm ultraviolet lamp, while the pure CsPbI3 QDs decomposed completely and no longer emitted light. The improved thermal stability of CsPbI3:Ce10% QDs mainly originates from the enhanced tolerance factor due to the smaller ionic radius (1.03 Å) of Ce than that of Pb ions (1.19 Å).32 Hence it can be concluded that an appropriate amount (∼10%) of Ce doping can stabilize the crystal structure of CsPbI3 QDs.
The solvent stability test of PQDs was performed by tracing the process of dropping the DMF solvent onto PQDs, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). After dropping the CsPbI3:Ce10% QD solution on a white paper and then heating at 125 °C for 30 s, the PQDs emitted obvious orange-red light under 365 nm ultraviolet light (Fig. S6(a), ESI†). Then 5 μL and 500 μL of the DMF solution were dropped onto PQDs separately. The sample contacting with 5 μL DMF still partially emitted orange-red light (Fig. S6(b and d), ESI†), while the sample prepared with 500 μL DMF no longer emitted light (Fig. S6(c and e), ESI†). This phenomenon proved that CsPbI3:Ce10% QDs would only partially decompose when contacting with a small amount of DMF solution. The process details about the DMF solution stability of QDs are shown in Video S1 (ESI†). It should be noted that the CsPbI3 QDs will decompose more quickly as compared to CsPbI3:Ce10% QDs when contacting with DMF solution.
Pure CsPbI3 QDs and CsPbI3:Ce10% QDs were prepared to test the interface modification effects. Fig. 2 shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the TiO2 surface modified by PQDs. It can be seen that the average surface roughness of TiO2 treated by pure CsPbI3 QDs and CsPbI3:Ce10% QDs is 0.8 nm and 0.6 nm, respectively, which are lower than that of the bare TiO2 surface (1.9 nm). A smooth surface is beneficial for the growth of the upper perovskite film and provides a better interface contact.

Three semitransparent CsPbI2Br films were prepared by using 0.5 M CsPbI2Br precursor on different substrates, i.e., FTO/c-TiO2, FTO/c-TiO2/pure PQDs and FTO/c-TiO2/CsPbI3:Ce10% QDs, named control, Pure-PQDs PVK and Ce:PQDs PVK, respectively. Fig. 3(a–c) show the corresponding SEM images. There are apparent pinholes in the control film, while the PQD-treated PVK films are compact and pinhole free. In particular, the Ce:PQDs PVK film displays the best crystallinity. As mentioned before, due to its superior crystallinity and solution stability, CsPbI3:Ce10% QDs can be maintained for a longer time when contacting with the DMF solution, and hence can act as nucleation centers for inducing the crystallization process of the CsPbI2Br film. More SEM details on the PVK films treated with CsPbI3:Cex QDs are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Fig. 3(d–f) show the AFM images of the perovskite film surface. The Ce:PQDs PVK film shows minimal surface roughness (1.89 nm) as compared to the control film (2.24 nm) and the Pure-PQDs PVK film (2.08 nm). The lower surface roughness is related to a denser perovskite film and fewer surface defects. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. The main peaks observed in all samples are located at 14.2° and 28.47°, which correspond to the (100) and (200) lattice planes, respectively.33 The PQD substrate treatment did not result in extra peaks because of their same composition as the perovskite active layer. In the formation process of the PVK film, PQDs decomposed completely to passivate the defects and to avoid the formation of a PQD charge-blocking layer.29 The CsPbI3:Ce10% PVK film displayed the highest diffraction intensity, meaning the best crystallinity.

Here we proposed a practical method to prepare a high-quality perovskite film by using PQDs as substrates. This method was named PQD dynamically mediated growth of perovskite film (PDMG). The corresponding schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 4. The PDMG process includes three steps: dropping, spin-coating and annealing. In the dropping stage, the perovskite precursor solution was dropped onto the surface of PQD-modified TiO2. The PQDs can serve as nucleation sites to induce the crystallization of the perovskite film. In the spin-coating stage, the substrate is rotated for 30 s to remove the excess solvent. In this process the PQDs could be completely decomposed. The decomposition products, which are the components that make up the perovskite film, can enter the perovskite lattice to passivate both Cs+ cation and halide ion vacancy defects, which has been demonstrated by previous work.29,34 Finally, at the annealing stage, a high-quality perovskite film was formed after annealing at 125 °C.

Three film samples (PVK, Pure-PQDs PVK, and Ce:PQDs PVK) were prepared to confirm the effects of the PDMG process. Fig. 5(a) shows the absorbance results. The absorption intensity increases in the order of PVK, Pure-PQDs PVK, and Ce:PQDs PVK. The higher absorption strength is caused by the improved crystal quality. Here the absorption effect of rare earth elements is ignored because they are present in small amounts. Fig. 5(b) shows the PL results. The two films with the PDMG process show stronger PL quenching results, indicating that the PDMG process can effectively promote carrier extraction. The PL intensity of the Ce:PQDs PVK film is obviously lower than that of the Pure-PQDs PVK film, indicating that it displays a more excellent interface modification effect. Fig. 5(c) shows the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results. The decay lifetimes of PVK, Pure-PQDs PVK, and Ce:PQDs PVK film samples are 28.83, 17.29, and 9.85 ns, respectively. A shorter decay lifetime means a better electron extraction ability. The TRPL results are in agreement with the rule of PL. Both PL and TRPL measurements support that the PDMG process can promote the carrier extraction from the perovskite to the ETL, which is mainly due to the improved TiO2/perovskite contact interface. Furthermore, the PDMG process with Ce:PQDs contributes to a better performance in interface modification.

Three device samples, based on PVK (control), CsPbI3 QDs PVK, and CsPbI3:Ce10% QDs PVK, were prepared to further investigate the advance of the PDMG process. Fig. 6(a) shows the basic device structure of FTO/c-TiO2/(with or without) QDs/CsPbI2Br/P3HT/Ag. Fig. 6(b) shows the J–V characteristics. The average PCE values are 10.44%, 11.35% and 12.14% for the control device and devices treated with CsPbI3 QDs and CsPbI3:Ce10% QDs, respectively. The PSCs treated with CsPbI3:Ce10% QDs show superior performance. The detailed performance parameters are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). Voc, Jsc, and FF are all improved by the PDMG process. The increased Voc and FF are mainly due to the reduction of bulk and interface defects of the perovskite film. Furthermore, the increased Jsc is mainly due to the increased light absorption and improved electron extraction. The Jsc result is further proved by the EQE test, as shown in Fig. 6(c). The integrated Jsc values are 14.21, 14.68 and 15.10 mA cm−2, respectively. It is believed that the improvement in the entire spectral range in the EQE spectrum is related to better light absorption ability and faster electron extraction.35

It is worth mentioning that the PDMG process can also have positive effects on other inorganic systems. The device with the structure of FTO/c-TiO2/CsPbI3/P3HT/Ag was also prepared with or without the PDMG process. The result indicates that the PCE is enhanced from 14.43% for the control device to 16.38% for the PDMG treated device, and the details are shown in Fig. S10 and Table S1 (ESI†).
The electrical characteristics of the CsPbI2Br-based devices were also tested. Fig. 6(d) shows their dark J–V curves. Under reverse bias, the dark current of the device treated by CsPbI3:Ce10% QDs is lower than those of other devices, indicating minimized current leakage, which accounted for the reduced trap state density.36 Electron-only devices were measured in dark conditions to explicitly study the changes of defects, as shown in Fig. 6(e). The J–V curves showed a linear ohmic response of the devices at a low applied bias. When the applied bias is higher than the kink point, as indicated in each curve, the current density sharply increases, which means the trap states are completely filled. Therefore, the kink point represents the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL).37 The trap state density is positively correlated to VTFL, and the calculation formula is as follows:  where e is the electron charge, L is the thickness of the perovskite film, and ε is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite. It can be seen that the device treated by the PDMG process achieved a smaller VTFL. Correspondingly, the trap state densities of PSCs prepared by the PDMG process with CsPbI3:Ce10% QDs and CsPbI3 QDs are ∼2.92 × 1016 and ∼3.08 × 1016 cm−3, respectively, while that of the control device is ∼3.82 × 1016 cm−3. In particular, the device treated by CsPbI3:Ce10% QDs has the lowest trap state density, indicating more efficient electron transport/extraction and reduced non-radiative recombination. Fig. 6(f) shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test results, which can elucidate the extent of charge recombination in the PSCs. The resulting Nyquist plot was obtained under dark conditions at a 0 bias voltage. The diameter of the arc becomes larger, indicating that the charge recombination is mitigated. In this test, the device treated with CsPbI3:Ce10% QDs exhibited a larger recombination resistance than the other two devices.
Then the environmental stability of both the perovskite film and devices was studied. As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), the films were exposed to an air environment with a temperature of 25–30 °C and a humidity of 25–30% RH for 8 days. The control film showed obvious decomposition from the 5th day and it would completely decompose after the 8th day. The film treated by the PDMG process showed a slower decomposition process, and the Ce:PQDs PVK film shows the best film stability because the high-quality film can effectively resist the erosion of water and oxygen. Then, we carried out the device stability measurements without any encapsulation in a N2 environment. The normalized PCEs of the devices are shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). It is clear that the device prepared by the PDMG process with CsPbI3:Ce10% QDs maintained 64% of its initial efficiency after 30 days, while the control device kept 53% of its initial efficiency under the same storage conditions.
4. Conclusions
In this work, by introducing the rare earth element Ce into PQDs using the vacuum freezing and drying technology, we have successfully improved the structure and solvent stability of PQDs. Moreover, we proposed a novel technology, PQD dynamically mediated growth of perovskite film (PDMG), to prepare high-quality perovskite films, which can avoid the formation of PQD charge-blocking layers. It is clearly revealed in this work that the PDMG process can significantly improve the film crystallinity and the charge transport/extraction performance. For the P3HT-based CsPbI2Br PSCs obtained by the PDMG process, an improved PCE of 12.14% was obtained as compared to 10.44% for the control device. In addition, a remarkable PCE enhancement from 14.43% to 16.38% for P3HT-based CsPbI3 PSCs can also be achieved by this PDMG process. Via the PDMG process, the stability of both the film and devices has been improved. Overall, the PDMG process opens up a new avenue to use PQDs as substrates in PSCs. It enables a new and facile fabrication process for low-cost, efficient and stable all-inorganic PSCs.
