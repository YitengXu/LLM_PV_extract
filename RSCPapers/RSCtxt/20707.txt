    , Accepted 27th December 2019First published on 30th December 2019AbstractRecently, Bi2MoO6 (BMO) has been extensively investigated due to its noticeable photoelectrochemical water oxidation properties. However, the poor chemical stability and high photo-corrosion have suppressed its potential application and efficiency of solar energy conversion. In this work, BMO films have been successfully grown via a solvothermal method with different durations and the optimized synthesis conditions have been further retained to prepare Fe and W doped BMO photoanodes. Photocurrent densities as high as ≈1.81, 0.89, and 0.43 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE are obtained for the optimum 1% W doped, 1% Fe doped and pristine BMO, respectively, under light illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte in the presence of 0.05 M Na2SO3 hole scavenger. A high photocurrent density of about 107.84 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE is obtained for the optimized W doped photoanode in the absence of 0.05 M Na2SO3 electrolyte, which is 2.18 and 1.22 times enhanced compared to those of the optimum undoped BMO and Fe doped BMO thin film photoanodes, respectively. The dopant contributed to the oxygen vacancy and film conductivity and helped both in terms of stability and PEC activity. W and Fe doped BMO exhibit considerable stability under water and sulfite oxidation conditions compared to undoped BMO in the absence of any oxygen evolution co-catalysts.
1 Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems for converting sunlight to electric power hold promise as one of the sensible solutions to address future energy challenges. The key characteristics for an efficient PEC system are effective charge separation, fast charge transfer and a fast oxidation kinetics process. With these requirements, various n-type semiconductors such as TiO2,1,2 WO3,3 Fe2O3,4 ZnO,5,6 BiVO4 (ref. 7) and Bi2WO6 (ref. 8 and 9) have been extensively studied as efficient photoanodes for solar water oxidation. The band gaps of well-known oxides like ZnO, TiO2, and WO3 are markedly wide to absorb visible light. To narrow the band gap, the strategy of band gap engineering through cation combination has been reported. Combining an ns2 cation (e.g., Sn2+ and Bi3+) with an nd0 cation (e.g., Ti4+, V5+, and Nb5+) helps to couple O 2p and s orbitals, which forces the upward dispersion of the valence band, while d bands from the d0 cation and the p band from the ns2 cation keep the CB minimum low to form a reasonable band edge alignment with respect to water redox potentials.10 Among the various bimetallic oxide semiconductors, bismuth based oxides have attracted attention as Bi 6s orbitals can hybridize with O 2p orbitals to form a suitable valence band position. This provides sufficient overpotential for water oxidation as well as narrowing the band gap for visible light absorption.11 To date, BiVO4 based photo-electrodes have been widely studied and the reported maximum photocurrent density value is about 6.72 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE with a WO3/(BiVO4-CoPi) core–shell structure.12 However, recently Bi2MoO6 (BMO) has attracted widespread attention as an n-type semiconductor that has a narrow band gap of 2.4–2.8 eV with a suitable VB and CB edge position for redox reaction with high chemical stability and non-toxic features.13,14 BMO possessing an Aurivillius structure has a unique layered structure where perovskite slabs of corner-sharing (MoO6)2− octahedra are sandwiched between (Bi2O2)2+ layers.10,15 This layered crystal structure of BMO exhibits good photocatalytic activity due to the large surface area and abundant exposed active sites.16 Despite the aforementioned distinct properties, BMO suffers from rapid recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs and sluggish charge transport.17–19 Moreover, the low PEC stability of the BMO photoelectrode further reduces its efficiency. Although BMO possesses relatively better chemical stability in aqueous solution, this does not produce a steady output of photocurrent during PEC measurement. To overcome this limitation, many strategies have been developed such as doping,20,21 controlling the morphology,22 heterostructure formation, e.g. BiV2O5/WO3, Co3S4/MoS2, etc.,23–26 and introducing an overlayer (catalyst), e.g. Co, MoS2, Au, Bi, etc.,27–31 for improving its properties like charge carrier transport, charge separation and stability. Among the aforementioned strategies, doping appears to be an effective approach to modify the electronic structure to address the charge transport and PEC stability by creating an electric field near the semiconductor–electrolyte junction.27,32 For example, Jiao et al.32 reported that Fe and W doping in BiVO4 improved the PEC activity in terms of photocurrent and stability. A complete literature survey suggests that there are only a few reports on BMO particularly towards PEC applications. Recently, Xiong et al.10 reported the preparation of a nanoporous Bi2MoO6@Bi2Mo2O9 photoanode using the SILAR method and it exhibits a photocurrent of 0.160 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Bi2MoO6/MoO3 heterojunction film formed by anodizing Mo foil via hydrothermal treatment in bismuth salt solution displays a photocurrent density of 2.750 mA cm−2 at 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl.33 In another report, porous Bi/Bi2MoO6 nanoparticles were fabricated by a facile in situ reduction approach and a photocurrent density of 0.320 mA cm−2 was observed at −0.1 V vs. SCE in the presence of a hole scavenger in the electrolyte.34 However, to our knowledge, there is hardly any work on direct deposition of metal doped BMO thin films for PEC applications. This motivates us to develop metal doped BMO films and evaluate their potential for PEC applications. Our idea is to use metals like Fe and W as they are expected to reduce the bandgap and improve the PEC stability.32,35,36 In fact, we observed an enhanced photocurrent density of about 1.8 and 2.2-times (at 1.23 V vs. RHE) for Fe3+ and W6+ doped BMO films, respectively, compared to undoped BMO films. We believe this is due to enhanced light absorption, improved charge transfer, photocharge separation and better carrier lifetime through the formation of impurity bands with dopants in the forbidden band gap of BMO.
In this work, we have developed and compared the PEC water-splitting ability of five different thin films: (i) BMO nanoflakes, (ii) in situ formed Bi nanoparticles with BMO nanoflakes, (iii) Fe doped BMO nanoflakes, (iv) W doped BMO nanoflakes and (v) Bi nanoparticles. All of these thin films were achieved by varying the synthesis conditions (reaction time) as well as incorporating dopants by using a one-step solvothermal method. The schematic of the synthesis method and the experimental details are provided in Fig. 1(a) and in the ESI,† respectively. Specifically, the use of ethylene glycol in the solvothermal reaction causes reduction of Bi3+ to elemental Bi nanoparticles, which are uniformly deposited over the surface of BMO nanoflakes to form Bi/BMO, i.e., 18BMO (see the ESI†). The presence of Bi nanoparticles on BMO dramatically reduced the PEC performance compared to that of pristine BMO due to asymmetrical charge creation, transfer and recombination at the interface. However, optimized pristine BMO (i.e., 12BMO) samples show higher photo-electrochemical efficiency (see the ESI†). Furthermore, the doping concentrations of Fe and W were varied from 1 to 3 and 5% in optimized BMO (i.e., 12BMO) and hereafter these films are named 1FeBMO, 3FeBMO, 5FeBMO, 1WBMO, 3WBMO and 5WBMO, respectively. The PEC measurement reveals that 1% Fe and 1% W doped BMO nanoflake films show much higher PEC performance compared to other pristine BMO and Bi nanoparticle based samples.

2 Results and discussion
2.1. Structural characterization
The phase analysis of all the as-prepared thin film samples was performed using X-ray diffraction. The formation of BMO and elemental Bi, depending on the synthesis duration and effect of doping, was evaluated through XRD analysis and the results are illustrated in Fig. S1(a) and (b),† respectively. In Fig. 1(b), the XRD patterns of 1% Fe and W doped 12BMO (i.e. 1FeBMO and 1WBMO) are compared with that of the 12BMO sample. The XRD patterns of the undoped, Fe doped and W doped 12BMO thin films are in good agreement with that of the pure orthorhombic BMO structure (JCPDS 01-84-0787). Moreover, hardly any change is observed in the XRD patterns after doping with Fe and W ions, indicating that the dopants neither affected the crystal structure of BMO, nor introduced any other secondary phases such as Bi2O3, MoO3, WO3, Fe2O3, etc. This is likely due to the small difference in ionic radii between Mo6+ (59 pm), Fe3+ (64 pm) and W6+ (60 pm).37,38 The average crystallite sizes calculated from the XRD patterns using Debye–Scherrer's equation for samples 12BMO, 1FeBMO and 1WBMO are 31.1, 31.4 and 31.2 nm, respectively.
2.2. Morphological characterization
The surface morphology of all synthesized samples is presented in Fig. S2 (SEM images) and S3 (TEM images).† The results indicate a change in the shape of nanoparticles from nanoflakes to nanospheres with an increase in the reaction time. Fig. 2 presents the SEM and TEM images of 12BMO, 1FeBMO and 1WBMO nanoflakes. With low and high magnification SEM images, it can be seen that film surfaces are covered with vertically aligned nanoflakes with an average width of about 24–27 nm and a length of about 90–95 nm, which is comparable to the crystallite size calculated from the XRD pattern. The cross-sectional view shows the layer by layer formation of these nanoflakes with an average thickness of 600 to 800 nm (Fig. 2(a), (e) and (i)). All doped samples (Fig. 2 and S4†) show similar morphologies to the 12BMO sample indicating that the dopants have no discernible effect on the morphology and structure. More specifically, the HRTEM images shown in Fig. 2 revealed that nanocrystals corresponding to the 12BMO sample have a (131) plane with an interplanar spacing value of 0.312 nm while 1FeBMO and 1WBMO samples show the corresponding interplanar spacing values of 0.318 and 0.315 nm, respectively.39 The values of the adjacent (131) plane of all doped samples (Fig. S4†) are consistent with that of the (131) plane of pure BMO, implying that the crystal structure of BMO is not much influenced by the incorporation of a small concentration of dopant ions, which is supported by the results from XRD analysis.40 The presence of the individual elements with the respective composition in 12BMO as well as in other optimized samples was confirmed from the EDAX and elemental mapping by using TEM analysis (Fig. 3 and S5–S7†). The obtained atomic percentage from EDAX analysis matches closely with that of the added composition.

2.3. Composition and optical characterization
The effect of synthesis duration and dopants on BMO has been studied by using optical absorption analysis (Fig. S8(a)†). Fig. 4(a) shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of all optimized samples. The results suggest that 1FeBMO and 1WBMO exhibit higher absorption and a shift in absorption edge towards longer wavelength compared to the 12BMO sample. We believe this is likely due to the formation of a donor/acceptor level within the band gap of BMO.41 It is further noted that the absorption edge of the 1WBMO sample is more red shifted compared to that of 1FeBMO. However, further increase in the doping concentration to 3 and 5% resulted in decreased absorption and an increased band gap compared to 1% doped samples as indicated by Fig. S8(b).† The band gap values are presented in Table S2.† To further understand the shift in the absorption edge and band gap tuning with doping concentration, XPS measurement was performed. The presence of host elements and dopant ions and formation of defect levels in the BMO lattice are confirmed from XPS measurements. The XPS spectra of 12BMO, 1FeBMO and 1WBMO are shown in Fig. 4(b–d). Defect levels in the BMO lattice are confirmed from XPS measurements. The XPS spectra of 12BMO, 1FeBMO and 1WBMO are shown in Fig. 4(b–d). Interestingly, for 1FeBMO, a shift towards lower binding energy is noted for the peaks of the host cations (Bi3+ and Mo6+) compared to 12BMO. In contrast, for the corresponding host cations, a shift towards higher binding energy is observed for the 1WBMO sample (Fig. 4(b) and (c)). These shifts might have occurred due to the relatively lower and higher electronegativities of the dopants compared to the host ion (Fe3+ < Mo6+ < W6+).20,42 Fig. S9(a)† shows the weak peak located at 711.9 eV assigned to Fe 2p3/2, which denotes the presence of Fe3+ in the 1FeBMO sample.43 Similarly, the presence of W has been detected in XPS analysis (see Fig. S9(b)†) with the observation of W 4f peaks around binding energies of 34.6 and 36.5 eV. The energy position of these peaks confirms that the oxidation state of W in the 1WBMO sample is +6.43

As shown in Fig. 4(d), the O 1s peak can be de-convoluted into three different peaks. The two peaks at 529.4 and 530.15 eV for 12BMO films are related to lattice oxygen, i.e. Bi–O and Mo–O, respectively.44,45 Upon Fe doping, the binding energy of lattice oxygen shifts slightly to 529.1 and 529.5 eV, while for the W doped sample, the oxygen peaks are observed at 529.3 and 530.4 eV. In the case of the 1FeBMO film, the peak area for Mo–O is decreased about 28% while for the 1WBMO film, the decrease in the peak area is about 84% indicating that W ions are better dispersed in the substitution sites of the BMO lattice. A possible reason for the efficient substitution is the comparable ionic size of W6+ (60 pm) and Mo6+ (59 pm), which is less permissible for Fe doped BMO due to the larger ionic size of Fe3+ (64 pm). In addition to the lattice bound oxygen, another peak for non-lattice oxygen or the surface absorbed –OH group has been found at 531.9 eV which denotes the presence of oxygen vacancies.46,47 This result may be assigned to originate from the production of oxygen vacancies in (MoO6)2− layers and the oxygen deficient surface may absorb many more non-lattice oxygen atoms to establish a balance.48,49 In the absence of dopants the observed small peak area for non-lattice oxygen suggests the presence of fewer oxygen vacancies in the sample. On the other hand, with Fe and W doping, the non-lattice oxygen increased about 2 and 4 times compared to that in the undoped sample, respectively. The increase in the area of non-lattice oxygen indicates the formation of more oxygen vacancies in the lattice.47 The results and the quantitative analysis of the elemental compositions in the undoped and doped samples acquired from the de-convoluted XPS peaks are presented in Table S1.† A probable reason for the band gap tuning by introducing Fe and W in the BMO lattice is discussed below. When 12BMO film is doped with 1% Fe and 1% W, acceptor levels of Fe and W along with oxygen defect levels are created inside the band gap, respectively, resulting in a shift of the band edge towards higher wavelength.47 From the XPS results it is clear that for W doped BMO thin films more oxygen vacancies are produced compared to Fe doped BMO and 12BMO (i.e. undoped) films, which endowed 1WBMO with the lowest band gap.46 However, from the UV-vis spectra, we observed a continuous shift in the absorption band edge to higher energy with increasing doping concentration (for 3 and 5%). We presume that this behavior is likely due to the Burstein–Moss effect.47 The Burstein–Moss effect originates from excess charge carrier concentration which results in lifting of the Fermi level above the conduction band.50 We believe that a probable reason for the Burstein–Moss shift in this case is the increased doping concentration which might have introduced more oxygen vacancy defect levels within the band gap. This implies that donation of more electrons leads to shifting of the Fermi level towards the conduction band resulting in an increased band gap. The proposed band gap tuning for both Fe and W doped 12BMO is illustrated schematically in Fig. S10.†
2.4. PEC performance of Fe and W doped BMO electrodes
The as-prepared BMO films were tested as a photoanode in a three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH 7) (see details in the ESI†). The n-type nature of the grown semiconductors is further verified with a positive slope in Mott–Schottky plots acquired at a frequency of 10 kHz (Fig. S11(a)†). For n-type semiconductors, the flat band potential is considered to be roughly in the vicinity of the conduction band, leading to the estimation of the conduction band position.51 The flat-band potential for 12BMO estimated from the Mott–Schottky plot is −0.73 V vs. Ag/AgCl (−0.10 V vs. RHE). Upon doping, the flat band potential for 1FeBMO and 1WBMO shifted to −0.70 and −0.75 V vs. Ag/AgCl (−0.07 and −0.12 V vs. RHE), respectively. The slopes obtained for the above samples indicate an increase in the electron carrier density for 1WBMO and a decrease in the case of 1FeBMO compared to the 12BMO sample (see Table 1). We believe that a probable reason for lower carrier density in 1FeBMO is the deficiency of free charge carriers. The free electron charge in Fe3+ is lower than that in Mo6+, and therefore Fe doped BMO samples suffer from low electron carrier concentration and shift the conduction band of BMO downwards. In contrast, for the 1WBMO sample, W6+ ions have the same valence charge as Mo6+ and the formation of a high oxygen vacancy donor level lifts the electron carrier concentration and conduction band compared to those in the 12BMO sample.

For comparison, the PEC performances of all n-type semiconductors have been measured using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) (photocurrent density vs. potential) curves in the presence of 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte solution (pH 7) (Fig. S11(b)–(d) and Table S2†). Fig. 5(a) shows a pronounced 1.5 fold increase in photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE for 1WBMO compared to the 12BMO sample. The photocurrent of the 1WBMO electrode measured by water oxidation is found to be 107.84 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, while the photoelectrodes 1FeBMO and 12BMO generated 87.39 and 49.52 μA cm−2, respectively, at the same potential. The enhancement in the photocurrent is presumably due to the formation of defect levels which acted as trapping sites and increased the lifetime of charge carriers up to an optimum point, resulting in enhanced PEC conductivity.52 Briefly, we propose that when the photoelectrodes were illuminated, electrons travel from the valence band to the conduction band through the trap sites of doped BMO nanoflakes with improved lifetime and transfer ability and are further collected by FTO.

(g) Schematic illustration of the photoelectrochemical process in the Fe/W doped BMO film under light illumination. 
A schematic of the proposed mechanism is given in Fig. 5(g). The high carrier concentration and reduced band gap of 1WBMO resulted in high PEC activity. Table S3† compares our results with those of previous reports on BMO photoelectrodes. It is clear from Table S3† that the PEC performance of our BMO films is better than that of the reported ones. The improved photoconductivity of the films with W and Fe doping has been evidenced with enhanced charge carrier density, but noticeably the photocurrent density consistently decreased with increasing dopant concentration to 3% to 5% (Fig. S12(a)†). The observed reduced photocurrent with a higher doping level could result from formation of excess dopants leading to a large number of oxygen vacancies which might act as recombination centers thus reducing the photocurrent.53
Additionally, we acquired the photoconversion efficiencies of all the doped BMO samples (shown in Fig. S12(b)†). The measured photoconversion efficiency values of 12BMO, 1FeBMO and 1WBMO films are 0.010% (at 0.83 V vs. RHE), 0.021% (at 0.76 V) and 0.023% (at 0.86 V), respectively. The photo-response was measured by using chopped light illumination at 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.9 V vs. RHE) through chronoamperometry measurements shown in Fig. 5(b). The chronoamperometry results indicate that the 1WBMO photo-electrode exhibits the highest photocurrent density compared to all other photoelectrodes as shown in Table 1. When the light is turned on, sharp photocurrent spikes are observed for all photoelectrodes (see Fig. 5(b) and S12(c)†) and when the light is turned off, there is a decrease in photocurrent density, indicating the effect of photo-excited charge separation. The steady decrease in the current suggests that in the absence of hole scavengers, materials exhibit photocorrosion,54 which has been further confirmed by PEC measurement in the presence of sacrificial hole scavengers like Na2SO3. The sulphite oxidation is favored over water oxidation thermodynamically and kinetically due to the improved electron–hole separation on the surface of the photoanode. As shown in Fig. 5(c), with sulphite oxidation, the onset potential shifted to more negative values compared to that in water oxidation and more than ten times higher current density was observed for all samples. Introduction of electrolyte such as Na2SO3 improved the electron–hole pair separation since it is known to undergo fast oxidation by photogenerated holes at the photoelectrode surface.55 As expected, with a hole scavenger, the maximum photoconversion efficiency of 1WBMO is ≈0.02% at 0.6 V vs. RHE compared to ≈ 0.015% at 1.13 V for 12BMO (Fig. S12(d)†).
The carrier lifetime and recombination behavior were analyzed with the calculated transient decay time (τ) from chronoamperometry measurement in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (Fig. S13(a)†). It was observed that the 1WBMO sample shows a longer τ of 2.52 s compared to that of 1FeBMO (2.25 s) and 12BMO (1.84 s) samples. This suggests an increase in carrier lifetime with introducing Fe and W as dopants. The effect of dopants on the charge transfer dynamics of photoanodes was also investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. EIS revealed that under dark conditions, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) values of the 1FeBMO and 1WBMO samples are comparable to that of the 12BMO sample (Fig. S13(b) and Table S4†). However, with light illumination the observed Rct values of 1WBMO and 1FeBMO are significantly lower than that of the 12BMO sample. The lower Rct values of the doped samples under illumination confirm that these doped samples have the highest photo-charge separation and transfer ability.56 The chronoamperometry plot shown in Fig. 5(d) indicates high photocurrent spikes along with steady current in the presence of 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte with a hole scavenger compared to the one without any hole scavenger. The use of sacrificial oxidizing electrolytes is known to produce a much faster two-electron oxidation reaction compared to the four-electron water oxidation reaction,57 which would kinetically stabilized the photoanode.
Therefore, the photocorrosion stability of the optimized thin film samples was evaluated in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution in the presence and absence of 0.05 M sodium sulphite (Na2SO3) as a hole scavenger. The photostability of the photoanode is an informative performance parameter of the PEC water splitting process. Therefore, chronoamperometry measurement of all optimum photoanode films was carried out in both electrolyte solutions at a constant potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE under constant light illumination for three hours and the results are shown in Fig. 5(e) and (f). It has been observed that, for all samples, the photocurrent continues to decrease over minutes in the absence of the hole scavenger and there is a prominent decrease in current density for 12BMO and 1FeBMO samples for two hours and 2.5 hours, respectively. With illumination for two hours, the photocurrents of 12BMO, 1FeBMO and 1WBMO photoanodes decreased to approximately 89.80, 61.96 and 23.43% of the original value, respectively. Thus, the photostability of BMO is improved by W and Fe dopants and this suggests that Fe and W dopants in the lattice act as active sites to chemically passivate the surface traps and prevent back electron transfer, leading to efficient stability under illumination and electrical biasing.20 However, no significant decay is observed for any of the samples upon introducing the hole scavenger, thus suggesting that the sulfite oxidation reactions are very stable. In fact, we observed that in both electrolytes, the 1WBMO film is more stable than the undoped and 1FeBMO samples, which demonstrates its structural stability in alkaline electrolyte. Fig. S14† shows the top view SEM images of these photo-electrodes after continuous illumination in the absence and presence of the hole scavenger. The 12BMO film is unstable in Na2SO4 electrolyte and significant morphological changes are observed for this sample. Interestingly, both 1WBMO and 1FeBMO are relatively more stable compared to the undoped sample. However, in the presence of the mixed electrolyte solution of Na2SO4 and Na2SO3, no significant change in morphology is observed for these films after a three hour photocorrosion test. The above results clearly demonstrate that these films can be of potential use for water splitting applications.
3 Conclusions
In summary, for the first time W and Fe doped Bi2MoO6 thin films have been successfully grown via a solvothermal method and used as photocatalytic electrodes for water splitting applications. The band structure of Bi2MoO6 has been tuned with varying concentration of Fe and W. Water oxidation and sulphite oxidation measurements clearly revealed that the W doped BMO photoanode attains significantly enhanced photocurrent densities of 107.84 μA cm−2 and 1.81 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under illumination. These values are 2.18 times and 4.2 times higher compared to the corresponding values for the optimized undoped Bi2MoO6 thin film photoanode, respectively. The results indicate that optimum W and Fe doping favors the formation of an impurity band with a reduced band gap and high photoconductivity, resulting in improved water oxidation reaction and photoconversion efficiency. According to the Mott–Schottky analysis and EIS analysis, the considerably enhanced performance of doped BMO could be predominantly attributed not only to the improved charge separation but also to the accelerated charge transfer. The photocorrosion of BMO has been effectively reduced through improved charge transfer and carrier separation efficiency by introducing dopants in the BMO lattice and thus, the stability of the optimum W and Fe doped BMO films was found to be superior to that of the pure BMO film. Overall, the approach discussed here provides new insight into the W and Fe dopant effect on BMO and also opens new possibilities to integrate the advantages of these semiconducting materials for future applications.
