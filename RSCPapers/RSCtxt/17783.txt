    , Accepted 10th December 2019First published on 20th December 2019AbstractWe report morphological control with phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) molecular aggregation for perovskite–PCBM bulk heterostructure (Pe–PCBM BHS) solar cells. Solar cells prepared via the Pe–PCBM BHS method exhibited a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18% than 11% from a device with a conventional planar heterojunction structure. The Pe–PCBM BHS can enhance device efficiency by improving electron transfer, shortening the electron transport length required for collection, and reducing the charge transfer resistance at the interface between the perovskite and PCBM through an increase of the perovskite crystal size and construction of a vertical perovskite–PCBM intermixing zone. To the best of our knowledge, the high PCE achieved by our Pe–PCBM BHS is the highest value to be reported in an inverted perovskite solar cell without buffer layers, such as metal oxides or low work function metals.
Introduction
Solar energy is one of the promising alternatives to existing fossil fuel energy generation due to its eco-friendliness and infinite source. Crystalline silicon solar cells have been widely used for both home and industrial power generation in roof-top or large area, ground-based installations. However, their application has been restricted by large space requirements, mechanical inflexibility, and non-transparency. Perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs, structural formula of ABX3, where A is an organic cation, B is a Pb cation, and X is a halide anion) can compensate for these shortcomings as well as achieve high device efficiencies of over 20%, a value that approaches the efficiency of silicon solar cells.1–5
Inverted pero-SCs have some advantages such as low temperature solution process and less device hysteresis because there is no need for high temperature-processed metal oxides. However, inverted pero-SCs (with a pin structure) generally have lower device efficiencies than those of conventional pero-SCs (with a nip structure) due to the low charge-carrier mobility of organic-based hole and electron transport materials, in which poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-styrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), respectively, have been typically used.6 Furthermore, control of the perovskite/PCBM interfacial morphology will be critical for efficient electron collection from the perovskite to the cathode because of the predominant generation of photoelectrons near the transparent anode requiring electrons to traverse the device thickness for collection.7,8 Various types of perovskite–PCBM mixed layers have been developed for improving the photoelectron collection efficiency and reducing recombination loss in inverted pero-SCs, starting from the planar heterojunction (PHJ)9–11 to the bulk heterojunction (BHJ).12–20
Although the perovskite/PCBM-based BHJ structure and subsequently investigated structures have usually been constructed by directly blending PCBM and perovskite, this method has limited control over the PCBM distribution in the perovskite layer.13 Another drawback of the BHJ structure is that even the best devices with only a perovskite–PCBM BHJ structure exhibit a low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12%. However, an extra PCBM layer can be deposited on top of the BHJ film to further enhance the PCE up to 16%. In other words, the effect of the perovskite–PCBM mixed interlayer on device performance in inverted pero-SCs has not yet been isolated.
In this study, we demonstrate a morphological control with PCBM molecular aggregation for perovskite–PCBM bulk heterostructure (Pe–PCBM BHS) solar cells. Manipulation of the degree of PCBM aggregation, which depends on PCBM solubility, enables control over the perovskite crystal morphology. This Pe–PCBM BHS can shorten the required transport length for electron transport, increase the thickness of the perovskite film, and improve electron collection efficiency by facile control of the perovskite/PCBM intermixing zone in inverted pero-SCs. As a result, the device prepared via the Pe–PCBM BHS method exhibits a significant enhancement of PCE, up to 16.49%, compared to that of the device with a PHJ structure (PCE of 11.65%). We also achieve a PCE of 18.08% using the Pe–PCBM BHS by introducing an additional PCBM buffer layer. This PCE value is comparable to the high reported efficiencies of inverted pero-SCs (ESI Table S1†).13,17,20
Results and discussion
Device fabrication via the Pe–PCBM BHS method

Fig. 1a shows a schematic illustration of the solvation of PCBM solutes in different solvents. We employed three solvents in which PCBM has different solubilities at room temperature: chlorobenzene (CB, 59.5 mg ml−1), chloroform (CF, 28.8 mg ml−1), and toluene (Tol, 15.6 mg ml−1).21–23 The degree of PCBM aggregation strongly depends on PCBM solubility. According to the size distribution of PCBM aggregates through dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement, the molecular size of PCBM aggregates is the largest with an average size of 159.43 nm in the PCBM-Tol solution, while it is the smallest with an average size of 43.60 nm in the PCBM-CB solution (CF-PCBM: 52.59 nm) at 25 mg ml−1 PCBM concentration (ESI Fig. S1†). The PCBM solution simultaneously plays two important roles in the fabrication of inverted pero-SCs via the Pe–PCBM BHS method: (1) an anti-solvent treatment for production of uniform CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films without pin-holes and (2) a delivery vehicle for the deposition of the PCBM layer on top of the perovskite film.24–28

(c) Schematic illustration for the growth of perovskite crystals by PCBM aggregates with different sizes in BHS films. 

Fig. 1b presents a detailed procedure for device fabrication via the Pe–PCBM BHS method. We also fabricated a control device with a PHJ structure for comparison. For fabrication of a device with the PHJ structure, perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on top of a PEDOT:PSS layer, and the anti-solvent treatment performed. After thermal annealing for transformation into the perovskite crystal phase, PCBM solution was spin-coated on top of the perovskite film. In the Pe–PCBM BHS method, the PCBM solution (dissolved in either CB, CF, or Tol) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite precursor film before thermal annealing for transformation of the precursor into the perovskite phase. Through this process, PCBM molecules can penetrate into the perovskite precursor film to a certain depth due to its soft matrix character before thermal annealing.17 In addition, we can control the depth of the perovskite/PCBM intermixing region by using the size dependence of PCBM molecular aggregation on PCBM solubility. The Pe–PCBM BHS method also simplifies the device fabrication procedure by simultaneously carrying out anti-solvent treatment and PCBM layer deposition on top of the perovskite film.

Fig. 1c exhibits the detailed growth mechanism of perovskite crystals by PCBM aggregates with different sizes in BHS films. We speculated that small PCBM aggregates induced by CB, which is a good solvent for PCBM, had a large number of spaces for evaporation of solvents (N,N-dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide), while large PCBM aggregates induced by Tol, which is a poor solvent for PCBM, had a relatively smaller number of spaces for solvent evaporation. This capping effect of PCBM aggregates on top of perovskite precursor film can lead to significant changes of perovskite crystals due to different solvent evaporation rates.20,29 In this respect, we expected the trend of solubility (CB > CF > Tol) to inversely follow the trend of perovskite crystal size (CB < CF < Tol).
Perovskite crystallinity
To investigate the influence of Pe–PCBM BHS on perovskite crystallinity, we performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Fig. 2a exhibits the XRD patterns of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films prepared by conventional anti-solvent treatment (using pure solvent) and the Pe–PCBM BHS process (using PCBM solution). Regardless of the solvent and preparation method, all perovskite films have the same XRD peaks at 14.1°, 28.4°, 31.9°, 40.4° and 43.2°, corresponding to the (110), (220), (310), (224) and (314) planes of the tetragonal crystal structure.29,30 This indicates successful conversion into the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal phase without residual PbI2 or methylammonium iodide (MAI), in spite of thermal annealing of the perovskite film after PCBM coating in the Pe–PCBM BHS method. However, it is notable that XRD peak intensities of the perovskite films prepared via the Pe–PCBM BHS method were remarkably higher than those of films prepared only with anti-solvent treatment. In particular, the film prepared via the Pe–PCBM BHS method using Tol showed the highest peak intensities among the films with the Pe–PCBM BHS. These results imply that the solubility-based control of PCBM aggregation size in the Pe–PCBM BHS method can be used to increase the perovskite crystallinity by passivating the perovskite film with a PCBM layer and then suppressing rapid evaporation of polar solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).18 However, there were indistinguishable differences in color of real perovskite films prepared via different processes (inset of Fig. 2a).

The inset of (b) shows real images of perovskite precursor films after pure anti-solvent treatment and the Pe–PCBM BHS process before perovskite crystallization. 
To gain insight into which step of the Pe–PCBM BHS method has the strongest effect on high perovskite crystallinity, we also performed XRD on the perovskite precursor films before perovskite crystallization. Fig. 2b presents XRD patterns of perovskite precursor films after anti-solvent treatment or the Pe–PCBM BHS process and before thermal annealing. All Pe–PCBM BHS films showed a darker color than the film treated with pure CB because of the existence of PCBM film on the perovskite precursor film (inset of Fig. 2b). Since all films were measured before thermal annealing treatment, we observed XRD peaks with extremely low intensities, compared to those of the annealed samples. The perovskite film with anti-solvent treatment using pure CB showed dominant peaks at 14.1° and 28.4°, corresponding to the tetragonal phase of perovskite. In contrast, all films prepared via the Pe–PCBM BHS method exhibited a prominent peak at 25.16°, corresponding to the PbI2–DMSO intermediate phase. These results confirm that the capping effect of the PCBM layer coated on top of perovskite film in the Pe–PCBM BHS method results in high crystallinity by inducing slow solvent evaporation.20,31
Perovskite–PCBM interfacial morphology in the lateral and vertical directions
To compare the difference of the perovskite–PCBM interfacial morphology between the PHJ and Pe–PCBM BHS, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with top-view mode and atomic force microscopy (AFM) for lateral morphology, as well as time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and cross-sectional SEM (CS-SEM) for vertical morphology. As expected from the XRD results, the SEM images of all perovskite films treated with pure anti-solvents exhibited uniform perovskite morphology with small grain size (100–500 nm) (Fig. 3a–c). These results indicate that the type of anti-solvent has no effect on the perovskite morphology and grain size in a PHJ structure. In contrast, the perovskite crystal morphologies of the Pe–PCBM BHS films were strongly dependent on the kind of solvent (Fig. 3d–f). We observed large perovskite crystals, with sizes of 1.0–1.5 μm, for the films fabricated with BHS-CB and BHS-CF. Interestingly, there were huge perovskite crystals, with sizes of 2.5–4.0 μm, for the BHS-Tol film. The AFM images were in good agreement with the SEM results (ESI Fig. S2†). The perovskite film with anti-solvent treatment using CB exhibited an even surface with a low surface roughness (root mean square: rms) of 6.13 nm (Fig. S2a†). Spin-coating PCBM on this perovskite film (PHJ structure) made the surface even flatter, reducing the surface roughness to 2.41 nm (Fig. S2b†). All films prepared via the Pe–PCBM BHS method exhibited bumpy surfaces with a high surface roughness of over 40 nm. Among these three films, the film with Pe–PCBM BHS-Tol showed the highest roughness of 85.02 nm. These AFM results confirm that the Pe–PCBM BHS method led to the formation of large perovskite crystals.

(j–o) EDS mapping profiles of SEM images (g–i) showing Pb (green, j–l) and O (cyan, m–o) elements in perovskite films with the Pe–PCBM BHS using CB (j and m), CF (k and n), and Tol (l and o). Scale bar is 2.5 μm. 
To investigate the molecular distribution of perovskite and PCBM in the films with the PHJ and Pe–PCBM BHS, we performed energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements. Fig. 3g and h show SEM images of films with the Pe–PCBM BHS used for EDS mapping. Unlike the top-view SEM measurements (beam energy of 1.6 kV), we applied a beam energy of 15 kV for elemental mapping analysis. The change of perovskite grain features for the different solvents was consistent with the top-view SEM images. In contrast, the PCBM film coated on perovskite with anti-solvent treatment using CB (PHJ structure) showed an even surface without perovskite grains (ESI Fig. S3a†). For elemental mapping images, we detected Pb and O to indicate the presence of perovskite and PCBM, respectively. The PHJ film exhibited well-distributed and continuous Pb due to the uniformity of the perovskite film and its small grain size (ESI Fig. S3b†). The PCBM film coated on this perovskite layer also showed a homogeneous distribution of PCBM molecules (ESI Fig. S3c†).
In the EDS mapping profiles of Pe–PCBM BHS samples, the Pb elemental mapping images of all the Pe–PCBM BHS films matched the shape of the observed perovskite grains well (Fig. 3j–l). The unique surface morphologies of the Pe–PCBM BHS films obviously resulted from the perovskite crystals, not the PCBM. The O elemental mapping images showed a uniform distribution of PCBM molecules on perovskite films fabricated with BHS-CB and BHS-CF (Fig. 3m and n), while the BHS-Tol film showed a non-uniform PCBM distribution in which the PCBM had the tendency to deposit in perovskite-deficient regions (Fig. 3o). These results also support the conclusion that the Pe–PCBM BHS method increases perovskite crystal sizes as well as enabling control of perovskite crystal size via PCBM solubility-dependent molecular aggregation.

Fig. 4b–e present TOF-SIMS profiles of perovskite/PCBM films with a PHJ and Pe–PCBM BHS for analysis of the vertical perovskite–PCBM morphology. Similar to the EDS experiments, we observed the Pb anion to detect perovskite and the O anion to detect PCBM in negative mass detection mode. Fig. 4a shows a schematic illustration of the sample structure for the TOF-SIMS measurement. We prepared all samples on PEDOT:PSS-coated substrates to employ an identical structure to that used for device fabrication. Three points were relevant for characterizing the degree of the perovskite–PCBM intermixing zone: the start point of the perovskite zone (PVTS, brown arrow), the maximum point of the perovskite zone (PVTM, blue arrow), and the point where the PCBM zone starts to decrease (PCBMD, black arrow). All films in our experiment, including the perovskite/PCBM film with a PHJ structure, had a perovskite–PCBM intermixing zone (Fig. 4b). It is noteworthy that all the Pe–PCBM BHS films had longer intervals between PVTS and PCBMD and shorter intervals between PCBMD and PVTM, compared to those of the PHJ film (Fig. 4c–e). Specifically, when the Pb intensity of the Pe–PCBM BHS films was on the verge of reaching the maximum point (PVTM), the O intensity started to decrease. In contrast, the PCBM intensity of the PHJ film was fairly low at PVTM. These results indicate that the Pe–PCBM BHS method contributes to the high degree of perovskite–PCBM intermixing zone.

(b–e) TOF-SIMS profiles showing O (black line) and Pb (red line) elements from the top PCBM layer to the bottom PEDOT:PSS layer of the films with the PHJ structure using CB (b) and the Pe–PCBM BHS using CB (c), CF (d), and Tol (e). (f–i) Cross-sectional SEM images of films with the PHJ structure using CB (f) and the NSM structure using CB (g), CF (h), and Tol (i). Scale bar is 500 nm. 
Although all Pe–PCBM BHS samples showed negligible differences in intervals between PCBMD and PVTM, there are significant differences of penetration depth for amount of PCBM (see the green boxes in Fig. 4c–e). After PVTM, the BHS-CB film exhibited the slowest reduction rate for PCBM amount among Pe–PCBM BHS films. Specifically, the trend of PCBM solubility (CB > CF > Tol) inversely followed the trend of reduction rate for PCBM amount (CB < CF < Tol). These phenomena resulted from different sizes of perovskite crystals due to different PCBM solubility. The BHS-Tol film showed that the PCBM region dramatically decreased after the dominant PCBM zone (ESI Fig. S4†). In other words, larger perovskite crystals led to a rapid reduction rate for PCBM amount, compared to smaller crystals. A slower reduction rate for PCBM amount is more favorable for a high degree of perovskite–PCBM intermixing zone. Consequently, vertical perovskite–PCBM intermixing morphology is beneficial for efficient exciton dissociation and photoelectron collection by providing a larger interfacial area and a shorter electron transport pathway.
We also conducted CS-SEM studies to investigate the vertical morphology of real devices with PHJ and Pe–PCBM BHS structures, as shown in Fig. 4f–i. The device with a PHJ structure had a thickness of 270 (±12) nm for perovskite and 65 (±5) nm for PCBM (Fig. 4f), which were the optimum thicknesses for device efficiency. All devices with the Pe–PCBM BHS exhibited thicker perovskite thicknesses of 350–370 nm under the optimum conditions (BHS-CB: 375 ± 40 nm, BHS-CF: 350 ± 48 nm, and BHS-Tol: 350 ± 80 nm), while the PCBM films in these devices were thinner than that in the device with the PHJ structure (BHS-CB: 50 ± 5 nm, BHS-CF: 48 ± 8 nm, and BHS-Tol: 60 ± 13 nm). As expected from TOF-SIMS profiles, the PCBM layer fully covered the surface of all perovskite films prepared via the Pe–PCBM BHS method. This full and uniform PCBM coverage prevents shunt pathways by avoiding unfavorable contact between the perovskite and the top electrode. Large deviations of the perovskite film thickness in the CS-SEM images confirm that the rugged surface of the Pe–PCBM BHS films resulted from the perovskite crystal morphology, not aggregation of PCBM.
Comparison of device performance between PHJ and Pe–PCBM BHS structures
We fabricated inverted pero-SCs by introducing the PHJ and Pe–PCBM BHS where PEDOT:PSS and PCBM were used as the hole and electron transport layers, respectively. A simple device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Al was employed to focus on the influence of the different structures on device performance. Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b show current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for the devices with the PHJ and Pe–PCBM BHS fabricated using different solvents. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of these devices are listed in Table 1. For device fabrication via PHJ and Pe–PCBM BHS methods, the PCBM film thickness is strongly dependent on the type of solvent used due to the different boiling points and vapor pressures of the solvents. We optimized the PCBM film thickness for each device by varying the concentration of the PCBM solution from 15 to 40 mg ml−1 (ESI Fig. S5†). Regardless of the kind of anti-solvents used, all devices with the PHJ structure exhibited similar PCEs (PHJ-CB: 11.65%, PHJ-CF: 11.78%, and PHJ-Tol: 11.28%), which are comparable device efficiencies to those reported in previous literature.32–36 Notably, the introduction of the Pe–PCBM BHS method led to a remarkable PCE enhancement. The BHS-CB device exhibited the highest PCE of 16.49% among the devices with the Pe–PCBM BHS (BHS-CF: 15.85% and BHS-Tol: 13.81%). The bumpy PCBM film on top of the perovskite, as observed in AFM and CS-SEM results, may have a negative effect on the final device performance. Therefore, further improvements to device efficiency might be possible with flattening and smoothing of the PCBM layer. Accordingly, an additional PCBM layer on top of the perovskite–PCBM active layer was introduced to the device with Pe–PCBM BHS-CB. This addition further increased the device efficiency up to 18.08%. This PCE is the highest value to be reported in inverted pero-SCs without buffer layers, such as metal oxides (TiOx, ZnO) or low work function metals (LiF, Ca, and Ba).37–41

Compared to the devices with the PHJ structure, the high PCEs of the devices with the Pe–PCBM BHS mostly resulted from JSC improvement. The Pe–PCBM BHS method for device fabrication increased JSC of all devices from 16–17 to 22–24 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5c). UV-vis absorption measurements (ESI Fig. S6†) confirm that these JSC improvements mainly resulted from increased perovskite grain size and perovskite–PCBM intermixing morphology, not enhanced light absorption by the thicker perovskite film. There were negligible differences in the UV-vis absorption of the perovskite–PCBM films with the PHJ and Pe–PCBM BHS. Slight differences in the optimum perovskite and PCBM thickness have a minor influence on the light absorption due to the high absorption coefficient of the thick perovskite film. The calculated JSC values from EQE curves were consistent with those from J–V characteristics (Fig. 5b).
We measured the hysteresis and stability of the devices with the PHJ and Pe–PCBM BHS. The J–V curves measured by forward and reverse scans (scan rate: 30 mV s−1) are shown in ESI Fig. S7.† The device with the PHJ structure showed ∼10% difference in device efficiency between the forward and reverse scans, whereas all devices with Pe–PCBM BHS exhibited negligible difference (ESI Table S2†). The device stability was investigated by storing the devices for 260 hours in a glovebox filled with nitrogen because of the vulnerability of the aluminum electrode to oxidation. The optimum device with BHS-CB exhibited higher stability than the device with the PHJ structure (ESI Fig. S8†). This higher stability may be attributed to the small number of pinholes and crystal boundaries due to larger perovskite crystal grains in the device prepared via the Pe–PCBM BHS method.
Charge transfer/recombination dynamics
To investigate the PL lifetime of the optimized Pe–PCBM BHS using the different solvents (30 mg ml−1 CB, 25 mg ml−1 CF and 20 mg ml−1 toluene) (see Fig. S5†), the PL decay in the Pe–PCBM BHS films, PHJ-CB film and the CH3NH3PbI3 control was measured using time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC), as shown in Fig. 5d. Any PL quenching would indicate that the Pe–PCBM BHS contributes to efficient and faster electron transfer from perovskite to PCBM, compared to the PHJ-CB planar film.
We attribute the initial fast decay in each of the Pe–PCBM BHS films to an efficient quenching of electrons into the PCBM and the long decay to slower recombination.42–45 This efficient quenching explains the high short-circuit currents. We note that any passivation effect from the penetrated PCBM will mean that it is unlikely that carrier trapping is responsible for the quenching. We note that this carrier quenching in principle leads to a reduction in luminescence efficiency and hence open circuit voltage (Voc),43 but the ultimate effect on Voc appears to be negligible, likely because the decrease in luminescence is quite small.46 These results were confirmed via PL measurement, as shown in Fig. 5e. The PL intensity of the BHS-CB film was slightly lower than that of the PHJ-CB film, which is actually a negligible difference.
To understand the high PCE of the device with the Pe–PCBM BHS, we performed electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 5f presents the Nyquist plots from EIS measurement for the devices with the PHJ and Pe–PCBM BHS. The impedance spectra of the perovskite solar cell were fitted using a Z-view equivalent circuit, which contains the sheet resistance, RSheet, of the electrodes and the charge transfer resistance, RCT. There were small differences in RSheet between the devices with the PHJ and Pe–PCBM BHS structures (PHJ-CB: 31.3 Ω, BHS-CB: 29.3 Ω, BHS-CF: 29.2 Ω, and BHS-Tol: 28.8 Ω) due to good contact between the perovskite and PCBM layer in all devices with the PHJ and Pe–PCBM BHS. In contrast, we observed slight differences in the RCT values. The device with the PHJ structure exhibited a higher RCT of 28.2 Ω than the devices with the Pe–PCBM BHS (BHS-CB: 16.8 Ω, BHS-CF: 18.4 Ω, and BHS-Tol: 19.7 Ω). Lower RCT of the Pe–PCBM BHS devices results from the small number of pinholes and grain boundaries introduced by large perovskite crystals. In addition, since the RCT values are strongly related to the morphological uniformity of perovskite films in the devices with the Pe–PCBM BHS, the device with BHS-CB showed the lowest RCT.
Because the Pe–PCBM BHS improved the electron collection efficiency and reduced the charge transfer resistance, as confirmed by TRPL and EIS results, we speculate that there is a significant difference in the impact of perovskite film thickness on the performance of the devices with the PHJ and Pe–PCBM BHS. Therefore, we fabricated devices with the PHJ and Pe–PCBM BHS with varying perovskite film thicknesses. The corresponding J–V curves and device parameters for these devices are shown in ESI Fig. S9 and Table S3.† We achieved optimum efficiencies in the PHJ and Pe–PCBM BHS devices using different perovskite precursor solutions with concentrations of 37 and 55 wt%, respectively. For all PHJ devices, increasing the concentration of the perovskite precursor solution from 37 to 55 wt% dramatically decreased the JSC and FF. In contrast, all the Pe–PCBM BHS devices exhibited a slight decrease in device efficiency when increasing the concentration from 45 to 55 wt%. These results support the conclusion that the enhanced electron transfer capability and reduced electron transport pathway achieved by introduction of the Pe–PCBM BHS enable an increase in perovskite film thickness for efficient light absorption.
Conclusion
We have demonstrated that the Pe–PCBM BHS method determines the perovskite crystal morphology by controlling the degree of PCBM molecular aggregation using different solvents. With this method, the perovskite crystal size can be modulated by tuning the size of PCBM molecular aggregates, which is determined by PCBM solubility. This method also enables the formation of a perovskite–PCBM intermixing zone in the vertical direction. This Pe–PCBM BHS contributed to increasing the perovskite crystal size, reducing the electron transport pathway, enhancing the electron transfer capability, and minimizing the charge transfer resistance at the interface between the perovskite and PCBM. Because of these capabilities, our device with the Pe–PCBM BHS exhibited a higher power conversion efficiency of 18.08% than the 11.65% observed for the device with a conventional PHJ structure. This Pe–PCBM BHS device efficiency is the highest value to be reported in inverted pero-SCs without a buffer layer between the PCBM and cathode. We believe that there are still considerable opportunities for further enhancing the device performance through investigation of the temperature dependence of PCBM molecular aggregation and introduction of a new buffer layer on top of the PCBM layer.
Experimental
Fabrication of devices with the PHJ and Pe–PCBM BHS
Patterned ITO coated glass substrates (sheet resistance: 30 Ω sq−1) were washed with detergent and ultrasonically cleaned sequentially in deionized water, acetone and 2-propanol. The substrates were dried in an oven for 4 h and then subjected to UV-ozone treatment for 10 min. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios VP AI 4083) solution was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then baked at 140 °C for 10 min. Both devices have the same HTL deposition process. The substrates were transferred into a glovebox and the active layer was spin-coated on the HTL layer from the precursor solution of perovskite (either 37, 45, or 55 wt%) consisting of MAI (Greatcellsolar) and PbI2 (lead(II) iodide, 99.9985% – Alfa Aesar) (1:1 w/w) that dissolved in a mixed solvent of DMSO:DMF (1:10 v/v). Spin coating of the perovskite precursor was performed at 1000 rpm for 5 s (first step) and then at 4000 rpm for 50 s (second step). For the device with the PHJ structure, an anti-solvent process was performed 5 s after the second spin-coating steps with 100 μl pure CB, CF, and Tol. For the Pe–PCBM BHS method, anti-solvents contained 15–30 mg PCBM (purity > 99.5%). After the precursor solution process, the pristine perovskite film was thermally annealed at 90 °C and the Pe–PCBM BHS perovskite film at 110 °C. For an additional PCBM layer, we spin-cast PCBM solution with a concentration of 30 mg ml−1 on the perovskite:PCBM layer that was prepared via the Pe–PCBM BHS method. Subsequently, a 100 nm Al electrode was deposited on top of the active layer under vacuum (<10−6 Torr) using thermal evaporation. The area of the Al electrode defines a 0.13 cm2 active area of the device. The J–V characteristics of the solar cells were measured using an LCS-100 Series Small Area Solar Simulator. The solar cell performance was tested with an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed using the PV measurement QE system by applying monochromatic light from a xenon lamp. XRD patterns were measured using a Rigaku Model Smart Lab at the Hanyang LINC + Analytical Equipment Center (Seoul). UV-vis absorption spectra were measured on a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer. Steady-state PL measurements were carried out using a pulsed xenon lamp. And time-resolved PL decay measurements were carried out using a He–Cd laser operating at a wavelength of 460 nm. AFM images (10 μm × 10 μm area) were obtained using an AFM microscope in non-contact mode. The functional groups of PCBM and CH3NH3PbI3 crystal components were analyzed by TOF-SIMS (Ultraflex III). TOF is a tandem mass spectrometry method where two time-of-flight mass spectrometers are used consecutively. Data were derived through anion analysis to analyze the presence of PCBM more sensitively. The first TOF is used to separate the precursor ions, and the second TOF-MS analyzes the product ions. An ion gate for selecting the precursor ion, an ion fragmentation region and an ion accelerator may be provided between the first and second TOFs. SEM measurements were performed with an SU8230 (Hitachi, Japan) with a beam energy of 1.6 kV (top-view and cross-sectional view) and 15 kV (element mapping). EIS measurement was carried out with an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz. We measured the device efficiency by using the PV measurement QE system by applying monochromatic light from a xenon lamp. The impedance spectra were fitted using a Z-view equivalent circuit which includes the sheet resistance of the electrodes and the charge transfer resistance. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were carried out using a Zetasizer instrument (ELSZ-2000, Otsuka electronic, Tokyo, Japan).
