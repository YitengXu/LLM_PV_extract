    , Accepted 18th January 2022First published on 19th January 2022AbstractThe boron dipyrromethane (BODIPY) unit has attracted interest due to its strong molar extinction coefficient and tunable electrochemical properties, and thus, currently, BODIPY-based organic photovoltaic materials featuring near-infrared absorption and deep HOMO levels are widely constructed and investigated. Herein, two novel A-π-D-π-A-type BODIPY small-molecule donors (SMDs), namely, CTBDP and DCTBDP, in which carbazole and indolo-[3,2-b]carbazole as the electron-donating core (D) connect the electron-withdrawing BODIPY moiety (A) with thiophene as a π-bridge, respectively, were designed and synthesized via Stille coupling reaction with a “D-π” segment at the β-site of BODIPY. CTBDP and DCTBDP exhibited a deep-lying HOMO level of −5.46 eV and −5.34 eV and narrow optical bandgap of 1.51 eV and 1.56 eV, respectively, together with a broad absorption in the range of 300–900 nm in films. Interestingly, the CTBDP-device exhibited an impressive PCE of 5.85% with an outstanding Jsc of 17.70 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.81 V, which are the highest PCE and Jsc values reported to date for A–D–A-type BODIPY-SMDs for solution-processed OSCs. Our work demonstrates that carbazole/indolo[3,2-b]carbazole-BODIPY conjugated small molecules can simultaneously achieve a narrow bandgap and low HOMO level via their rational molecular design, which provides crucial guidance for the development of high-efficiency BODIPY-based photovoltaic materials in the future.
Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have been extensively investigated with the development of polymers and small molecules (p-type and n-type) and device engineering due to their low cost, large-scale fabrication, light weight and easy flexibility,1 which have witnessed remarkable improvements in their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from ∼1% to the benchmark of above 18% in the past few decades.2 Owing to their well-defined structures, easier purification and better batch-to-batch reproducibility, organic small molecules have been considered as a promising alternative to polymer donor materials.3 However, although the highest PCE of 11.53% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.21 mA cm−2 has been achieved in fullerene-based OSC by Peng's team,4 the overall photovoltaic (PV) performance of small-molecule donors (SMDs) still lags behind that of other platforms. The main reason for this is that they have inadequate ability to efficiently harvest sunlight in the near-infrared region, thus leading to a limited Jsc in this type of device.5 Thus, to address this issue, one of the most promising strategies is to employ some well-known organic chromophores, including diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), squaraine, porphyrin and organoboron complexes, as overall electron-deficient or electron-rich moieties to construct different types of push–pull conjugated SMD materials.6 Among these building blocks, coordinated complexes such as porphyrin and organoboron derivatives, owing to their strong and broad absorption ability, are gradually regarded as promising candidates for exploiting narrow bandgap PV materials.7 Thus far, high-efficiency Zn–porphyrin and organoboron SMDs have achieved an impressive Jsc of 12.29 mA cm−2 and 14.32 mA cm−2, respectively.8
Accordingly, the superior features of simple synthesis and feasible purification of organoboron complexes provide an opportunity to compete with Zn–porphyrin materials. Besides, the B←N coordination bond has a large dipole and low bond dissociation energy, and thereby BN units embedded with the B←N bond have extremely strong electron-deficient property.9 Within a few years, as an efficient electron-withdrawing block, the BN unit has been gradually used in BODIPY and other organoboron SMDs for the fabrication of solution-processed OSCs.7b,10 In particular, considering the high molar extinction coefficient, good thermal stability and tunable redox activity of BODIPY,11 a variety of linear and muti-armed BODIPY-SMDs have been synthesized by substituting its α-, β- and meso-positions with different aromatic groups, where most of the reported PCEs have reached around 1–4%.7b,12 Recently, a PCE of 7.2% for a D-π-A-π-D-type SMD material based on a β-substituted BODIPY core was reported by Singh's group,13 which is the best PCE achieved for a linear BODIPY-SMD for solution-processed OSCs to date.
In comparison with other push–pull conjugated architectures, most of the A-π-D-π-A-type small molecules are generally comprised of oligothiophene, benzodithiophene (BDT), indacenodithiophene (IDT) and carbazole (Cz) as the central donor unit (D), and rhodanine, DPP and 1,3-indanedione as the terminal acceptor unit (A).14 Besides, a π-bridge can facilitate the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process from the D unit to A unit, and several π-linkers such as thiophene, oligothiophene, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene and ethinyl have been applied to tune the overall optoelectronic, charge transport property and molecular planarity of A-π-D-π-A-type materials.7b,15 Although the best PCE for A-π-D-π-A-type SMDs has reached 11.3%,16 the construction of BODIPY small molecules based on the above-mentioned structure is rarely reported.17 To date, the reported PCE of an A-π-D-π-A-type BODIPY-SMD containing ethinyl as the π-bridge was 4.65% by Zhao's team,17c but with only a Voc of 0.73 V and moderate Jsc of 11.84 mA cm−2. To better balance the HOMO level and molecular bandgap to some extent, a weak electron-rich π-linker can slightly elevate the HOMO level compared with the strong electron-deficient ethinyl spacer. Indeed, Bäuerle et al. successfully introduced thiophene as a π-bridge in the A–D–A conjugated skeleton, and consequently the HOMO level of the material sharply increased from −5.60 to −5.33 eV without further influencing its LUMO level, dramatically decreasing its molecular bandgap from 2.13 to 1.88 eV.18
The strong electron-donating Cz unit has many advantages such as easy structural modification, good thermal stability, excellent hole-transporting capacity and strong intermolecular interaction, and thus has been widely used as an electron-rich entity in the design of high-performance PV materials.19 Moreover, it has been demonstrated that 2,7-substituted Cz materials potentially offer better PV performances owing to their low-lying HOMO level and good planarity.20 At present, the best PCE of an A-π-D-π-A-type SMD based on the Cz core is 6.46% with a Jsc of only 10.40 mA cm−2 by Chen's team.21 Besides the superior properties of Cz, the indolo-[3,2-b]-carbazole (DCz) unit with an aromatic fused-ring structure displays larger π-electron delocalization and favorably closer solid-state packing, resulting in strong hole transport and high molecular crystalization.22 Furthermore, the present PCE of a polymer donor material based on the DCz core is 3.6%,23 but the DCz unit is scarcely utilized to create A-π-D-π-A-type SMDs especially DCz-BODIPY conjugated materials.24
Inspired by the above-mentioned π-linkage effect on A-π-D-π-A materials and combined structure–property relationship of each building block, herein, we incorporated thiophene into the Cz/DCz-BODIPY (called A–D–A) conjugated backbone to balance its molecular bandgap and HOMO level. Specifically, two novel A-π-D-π-A-type BODIPY dyes, namely, CTBDP and DCTBDP (see Fig. 1), in which Cz and DCz as the central unit (D) link the terminal electron-deficient BODIPY (A) through a thiophene π-bridge, respectively, were synthesized via the Stille coupling reaction between the “D-π” segment and β-substituted BODIPY entity. CTBDP and DCTBDP were employed as electron donors together with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an electron acceptor material for the fabrication of solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ)-OSCs, where after fine CH2Cl2 vapor treatment, the DCTBDP-device exhibited a PCE of 3.85% with a Voc of 0.75 V and Jsc of 14.59 mA cm−2. More interestingly, an encouraging PCE of 5.85% for the CTBDP-device was obtained with a Voc of 0.81 V and an impressive Jsc of 17.70 mA cm−2, which to the best of our knowledge, are the highest PCE and Jsc value of A–D–A-type BODIPY-SMDs for solution-processed OSCs reported to date.

Experimental
Reagents and materials
All reagents and materials were commercially purchased and directly used without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were distilled over sodium under an N2 atmosphere before the reaction. All reactions were conducted using the standard Schlenk technique unless noted.
Measurements and instruments
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the synthesized materials in chloroform solution and thin film state were measured with an Agilent Cary 5000 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were carried out on a CHI610D electrochemical workstation from CH Instruments, in 0.1 M anhydrous Bu4NBF4/CH2Cl2 solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 under an N2 atmosphere, using a glass-carbon electrode, Ag/Ag+ electrode (Ag in 0.1 M AgNO3 solution of acetonitrile) and platinum wire electrode as the working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode respectively, and the ferrocene-ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple as the internal standard. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TA Instruments Q50 thermogravimetric analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under an N2 atmosphere. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed under an N2 atmosphere at a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 with a TA Instruments Q20 differential scanning calorimeter. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OSCs were recorded with a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit under AM 1.5 G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the OSCs were measured using an integrated system IQE 200 (Newport, America) under monochromatic light from a 75 W Xenon lamp, where the light intensity was determined using a calibrated silicon photodiode. The J–V characteristics of the hole-only and electron-only OSCs were also recorded with the same Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit system under dark conditions.

Thermal stability
The thermal stability of compound CTBDP and DCTBDP was investigated via TGA and DSC measurement. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the decomposition temperature (Td) with a weight loss of 5% is 346 °C for CTBDP and 337 °C for DCTBDP. Furthermore, as depicted in Fig. 2(b), the DSC curves suggest that the endothermic peak related to the melting temperature is 226 °C for CTBDP and 185 °C for DCTBDP. Overall, the TGA and DSC measurements illustrate that these two compounds exhibit good thermal stability, meeting the requirement for the following fabrication of OSCs.

Results and discussion
Theoretical calculation
To obtain more information about the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels and electronic distributions of CTBDP and DCTBDP, density functional theory (DFT) was carried out to optimize the ground-state geometry at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level with the Gaussian 09 software.26 The octyl chain was replaced with a methyl group in all the molecules for simplifying the computational process. To explore the effect of the π-linkage on the A-π-D-π-A structure before the preparation of desirable narrow-bandgap materials, the reference molecules CBDP and DCBDP in which the Cz and DCz core are directly connected with the BODIPY unit, respectively, were also calculated. The optimized geometries and computational data for the four molecules are given in the ESI.† The FMO energy levels and theoretical bandgaps (EDFTgs) of CTBDP and DCTBDP are listed in Table 1. The HOMO level of the A–D–A-type molecules is −5.31 eV for CBDP and −4.88 eV for DCBDP, and their bandgaps are 2.34 eV and 2.02 eV, respectively (see Table S1 in ESI†), revealing that their low-lying HOMO level would probably broaden their molecular bandgap. However, upon inserting the weak electron-donating thiophene as a π-linker into the A–D–A-type skeleton, the HOMO levels of CTBDP and DCTBDP upshifted to −5.05 eV and −4.80 eV, and thus their EDFTg was reduced to 2.04 eV and 1.85 eV, respectively. Besides, the total energy of the A–D–A-type molecules in the ground state significantly decreased by 2.9 × 106 kJ mol−1 after introducing the thiophene π-linker (see Table S1 in the ESI†). Thus, the above-mentioned results demonstrate that the A-π-D-π-A-type structure maintains the advantages of the BODIPY unit and is more reasonable for the theoretical design of photovoltaic materials. Notably, the DCz-based molecules displayed a smaller EDFTg value compared to that of their Cz analogues, which is responsible for their higher HOMO level due to the strong electron-donating nature of the DCz unit, but does not favour an improvement in Voc.27 To further reveal the effect of incorporating thiophene on the planarity of the whole molecule, the dihedral angle of each building joint was analyzed based on the above-mentioned optimized configurations, and the dihedral angle values for all the molecules are depicted in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. S2(a) (ESI†). For compound CTBDP, the average dihedral angle between the Cz core and the thiophene π-bridge is ca. 23° (vs. ca. 23° for BODIPY and Cz part for CBDP), but the dihedral angle of thiophene and BODIPY is only ca. 2°, illustrating that the introduction of the thiophene π-linker hardly weakened the molecular planarity. In the same case, the dihedral angle between the DCz core and the thiophene π-bridge is ca. 21° for DCTBDP (vs. ca. 24° for DCz and BODIPY for DCBDP), whereas the dihedral angle of thiophene and BODIPY is also only ca. 5°. As shown in Fig. 3(a), it is worth mentioning that CTBDP shows better molecular coplanarity due to the smaller torsion angle between thiophene and BODIPY than that of DCTBDP, which would probably make difference in the photoelectric properties of the material.28 Compared with A–D–A molecules, the dipole moment values of CTBDP and DCTBDP are larger (as shown in Table S1 of the ESI†), indicating that A-π-D-π-A molecules may have different interactions with solvents (in solution) and themselves (in solid film).29 By contrast, the Cz-based molecules exhibit greater dipole moments, especially CTBDP (15.3 D vs. 7.7 D for DCTBDP), where the stronger dipole–dipole interaction may give the material higher hole mobility.30 As depicted in Fig. 3(b), the electronic density of the HOMO orbital for CTBDP and DCTBDP is mainly distributed on the electron-donating Cz (or DCz) and thiophene entity, whereas that of the LUMO orbital is located on the BODIPY moiety, suggesting the occurrence of an apparent ICT process from the donor unit (Cz or DCz) to the terminal acceptor unit (BODIPY) through the thiophene π-bridge. Similarly, the ICT process for CBDP and DCBDP also exists (Fig. S2, ESI†). The above-mentioned results show that the incorporation of the thiophene π-spacer not only ensures the planarity of the molecules, but also promotes the charge transfer process.

 Fig. 3  Summary of the theoretical calculation with the DFT/TD-DFT methods for CTBDP and DCTBDP: (a) optimized geometries; (b) energy levels and electronic density distributions; and (c) predicted UV-vis absorption spectra. 
In addition, to predict the absorption spectra of CBDP, DCBDP, CTBDP and DCTBDP, the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) method was conducted to predict 30 singlet excited-states (Sn) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level based on their optimized configurations. As shown in Fig. 3(c), all the molecules display two characteristic absorption bands in the range of 300–1100 nm, and the absorption bands of CTBDP and DCTBDP are greatly broadened compared to that of their A–D–A-type counterparts (the predicted absorption spectra of CBDP and DCBDP are presented in Fig. S2, ESI†), and all the TD-DFT calculation data are also summarized in the ESI.†
As shown in Table S1 and S2 of the ESI,† the ICT-induced absorption peaks originate from the S0 → S1 excited-state transition at 695 nm for CTBDP (vs. 609 nm for CBDP) and 763 nm for DCTBDP (vs. 721 nm for DCBDP), which are presented by the HOMO → LUMO electronic excitation. The corresponding transition composition is 69% (f = 0.4888) for CTBDP and 66% (f = 0.2614) for DCTBDP, and f is the oscillator strength. Furthermore, the high-energy absorption peaks are located at 428 nm for CTBDP and 389 nm for DCTBDP, which are mainly ascribed to the S0 → S7 (f = 1.6122, 47%) by HOMO → LUMO+2 and S0 → S14 (f = 1.2934, 43%) by HOMO → LUMO+3 electronic transitions, respectively. Although DCTBDP exhibits a broader absorption range, CTBDP may have a larger experimental absorption coefficient, which is related to its higher f value for the electronic transition in the whole visible region.31
The above-mentioned calculation results demonstrate that the introduction of the thiophene π-bridge into the A–D–A-type conjugated skeleton not only can reduce the bandgap of CTBDP and DCTBDP, but also enhance their absorption capacities. Overall, CTBDP exhibits better molecular planarity than DCTBDP owing to its relatively weak rigidity and the smaller steric hindrance of its Cz core, which may be more conducive to promote π-electron delocalization and strengthen intra-/intermolecular charge transport, and thus probably improve the PV performance of the devices.32 Although the calculated values are slightly different from the experimental values, which is probably due to the influence of the solvent effect, intermolecular interaction and other factors,28a the theoretical calculation still provides important guidance for the early design and synthesis of desirable materials.
Optical properties
To investigate the light absorption capacity of the materials, the molar extinction coefficient (ε) of CTBDP and DCTBDP was measured in 1.0 × 10−5 M chloroform solution, and their normalized UV-vis absorption spectra were measured in thin film. Consistent with the theoretical prediction, CTBDP and DCTBDP exhibit two characteristic absorption bands, and their optical data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the ε value of CTBDP in chloroform solution is 7.71 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 403 nm and 5.47 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 604 nm. Besides, the ε value of DCTBDP is 9.25 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 359 nm, 5.68 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 419 nm and 4.35 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 622 nm. Consequently, the greater ε value of CTBDP especially in the ICT-induced absorption band means that it can harvest more photons, which is beneficial to enhance the Jsc of the device.19c The absorption coverage of CTBDP and DCTBDP in the thin film state expands to nearly 900 nm, and the large red shifts for CTBDP and DCTBDP at the maximum absorption peak are 35 nm and 57 nm, respectively, indicating that there is a strong π–π interaction in the film state, which is helpful to enhance the Jsc of the device.33 In addition, the corresponding optical band gap (Eoptg) (Eoptg = 1240/λfilmedge) of CTBDP and DCTBDP in thin films is 1.51 eV and 1.56 eV, respectively, which successfully realizes the design of narrow bandgap materials.

Electrochemical properties
To study the redox properties and energy levels of the materials based on experiment, the electrochemical behavior of CTBDP and DCTBDP was investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement and the detailed CV measurements are described in the experimental section. The CV curves and their electrochemical data are presented in Fig. 5 and Table 1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the onset reduction value (Ered) is −1.04 V for CTBDP and −1.07 V for DCTBDP, and the calculated LUMOCV values are −3.71 eV and −3.68 eV, respectively, which are similar, according to the following empirical formula:34 LUMOCV = −(Ered − EFc/Fc+1/2 + 4.8) eV, where EFc/Fc+1/2 is 0.05 V (vs. Ag/Ag+). Thus, the above-mentioned results indicate that the different electron-donating cores have little effect on the LUMO level, which is consistent with the results of the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the HOMO levels of the materials were estimated by the difference between the LUMOCV and optical bandgap (Esolg) values in chloroform solution (HOMO = LUMOCV − Esolg).17c As listed in Table 1, the Esolg of CTBDP and DCTBDP is 1.75 eV and 1.66 eV, and the corresponding HOMO level is −5.46 eV and 5.34 eV respectively. According to the results of the theoretical calculation and experiment, CTBDP possesses a lower HOMO level than DCTBDP, which is conducive to the generation of a high Voc in the OSC.18,26 In addition, the frontier orbital energy levels of CTBDP and DCTBDP match well with that of the electron acceptor material (PC71BM),35 as depicted in Fig. 5(b), and the difference in the LUMO between CTBDP and PC71BM is 0.39 eV, and that of DCTBDP is 0.42 eV, which can provide the necessary driving force for the separation of free charges from hole–electron pairs at the D/A interface in blend films.36

Therefore, CTBDP and DCTBDP can be used as electron donor materials for subsequent device fabrication.
Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the PV properties of CTBDP and DCTBDP, BHJ-OSCs were fabricated with the conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMDs:PC71BM(w/w, 1:2)/Al and all the active layers were spin-coated from 12 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene (CB) solution. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics and PV parameters of the CTBDP- and DCTBDP-based devices are shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2, respectively. The basic device by directly spin-coating the CTBDP/PC71BM film gave a preliminary PCE of 3.02% with a Voc of 0.91 V, Jsc of 11.33 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.29. Besides, for the DCTBDP-based device, the PCE of 3.24% with a Voc of 0.80 V, a similar Jsc of 12.88 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.31 were achieved. The relatively high Voc and Jsc values of the devices are mainly due to the deep-lying HOMO energy level of the BODIPY-based materials and their wide and strong absorption characteristics. In addition, many studies have proven that solvent vapor annealing (SVA) technology can control the morphology of BHJ blends in SMD-fullerene systems, thus promoting the effective separation of excitons and charge transfer process in the active layer.37 To fully investigate the potential of the new materials, we tried to treat the active layer of CTBDP/PC71BM and DCTBDP/PC71BM with CH2Cl2 vapor for different durations. As presented in Table 2, when the CTBDP/PC71BM active layer was exposed to CH2Cl2 vapor atmosphere for 45 s, the PCE of the device significantly reached 5.85% with a Voc of 0.81 V, a surprising Jsc of 17.70 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.41, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest Jsc and PCE value of A–D–A-type BODIPY-SMDs for BHJ-OSCs reported thus far.12d,17,38 However, the performance of the DCTBDP-based device only slightly improved and the best PCE was 3.85% with a Voc of 0.75 V, Jsc of 14.59 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.35 with CH2Cl2 vapor treatment for 30 s. Overall, all the CTBDP-based devices exhibited a better photovoltaic performance compared with their DCTBDP counterparts, which may be due to their relatively low-lying HOMO level and efficient absorption of sunlight. In addition, the absorption spectra of blend films of CTBDP/PC71BM and DCTBDP/PC71BM under different conditions were also measured to further clarify the improvement in the Jsc of the above-mentioned devices (see Fig. S11 in the ESI†). As expected, the absorption of the two blend films was significantly enhanced after fine CH2Cl2 vapor treatment, where the CTBDP/PC71BM film showed relatively stronger photon absorption characteristics, thus making a greater contribution to the highest Jsc in the devices. As presented in Table 2, after CH2Cl2 vapor treatment, the series resistance (Rs) of the CTBDP-based device decreased significantly from 61 Ω cm2 to 16 Ω cm2, and the shunt resistance (Rsh) increased from 107 Ω cm2 to 160 Ω cm2. Meanwhile, the Rs value of the DCTBDP-based device was reduced from 37 Ω cm2 to 18 Ω cm2 and the Rsh increased from 79 Ω cm2 to 99 Ω cm2. In contrast, the Rs of the CTBDP-based device was significantly reduced and Rsh greatly increased, which indicates that a better ohmic contact and effective hole-extraction were formed after fine optimization of the active layer morphology, resulting in a further improvement in the Jsc and FF of the device.37d,39 In addition, the charge carrier recombination in the OSCs was also investigated by evaluating the dependence of Jsc and Voc on the light intensity (Pin),40 respectively (see Fig. S12 in the ESI†). As reported, the Jsc follows a power-law dependence on Pin (Jsc ∝ Pinα, where α is the calculated power-law exponent). Consequently, bimolecular recombination for all the CTBDP and DCTBDP-based devices is dominant with the α values of around 0.92, and slightly reduced recombination was achieved through fine vapor treatment of the active layers. However, the Pin dependence of the Voc showed a decreased slope of 1.17 kT/q and 1.29 kT/q for the optimized CTBDP and DCTBDP-devices, respectively (k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, Kelvin temperature, and elementary charge, respectively), in comparison with their as-cast counterparts. Overall, the CTBDP-device could strongly suppress the trap-assisted recombination under the open circuit condition, exhibiting less bimolecular recombination, which is consistent with its better PV performance. The detailed description of the relationship between Jsc (or Voc) and Pin, and the relevant data are given in the ESI.†

External quantum efficiency
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the CTBDP- and DCTBDP-based devices with/without solvent vapor treatment are plotted in Fig. 7. The CTBDP and DCTBDP-based OSCs present two characteristic photo-response bands in the range of 360–800 nm, which are consistent with their UV-vis absorption spectra. The as-casted CTBDP-device showed the maximum EQE value of 62% at 482 nm and 51% at 613 nm, respectively. In contrast, the DCTBDP-device displayed a stronger photoelectric response in the range of 400–800 nm with the maximum EQE value of 78% at 471 nm and 43% at 648 nm, leading to a relatively high Jsc, as obtained from the J–V curve. The integrated current (Jcalsc) estimated from the EQE spectra of the OSCs based on the CTBDP and DCTBDP active layers are 10.99 mA cm−2 and 12.25 mA cm−2, respectively (see Table 2), which are in accordance with the short-circuit current from their J–V characteristics (less than 5% error). In addition, the optimized CTBDP-based device exhibited a higher photoelectric conversion efficiency. The maximum EQE value was 95% at 481 nm and 78% at 615 nm, indicating a more effective photo-to-current conversion process. Consequently, the optimized CTBDP-based device produced the highest Jcalsc value of 16.93 mA cm−2, which reaches the level of most reported efficient porphyrin and BODIPY materials.8a,10b,12b,19c,41 For the DCTBDP-based device, a slight enhancement in its EQE spectra (less than 2%) was observed with the maximum EQE of 90% at 471 nm and 50% at 650 nm, and its Jcalsc value was 14.01 mA cm−2, which is close to the measured photo-current value of the device.

Charge carrier mobility
To deeply understand the charge-carrier characteristics of the CTBDP/PC71BM and DCTBDP/PC71BM blend films under different conditions, hole-only devices with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMDs:PC71BM/Au and electron-only devices with ITO/ZnO/SMDs:PC71BM/Al were fabricated, respectively, and then studied by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. The J–V curves in the dark and the charge carrier mobility date are presented in Fig. 8 and Table 2, respectively. The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) were estimated using the Mott–Gurney law, as follows:28a,42J = (9/8) ε0εrμh/e (V2/L3), where J is current density, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity and assumed to be approximately 3.0, μh/e is the hole mobility and electron mobility, V is the effective voltage, and L is the thickness of the active layer. As summarized in Table 2, the μh and μe values are 8.49 × 10−5/2.32 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the CTBDP/PC71BM film, and 1.30 × 10−4/4.51 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the DCTBDP/PC71BM film, respectively. As is known, unbalanced carrier behavior will be not conducive to improving the Jsc and FF values of the device.37d,41a Consequently, when the two blend films were treated with CH2Cl2 vapor, the μh and μe values increased significantly to 4.18 × 10−4/2.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the CTBDP/PC71BM active layer, and 2.12 × 10−4/7.20 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the DCTBDP/PC71BM blend film, respectively. It should be noted that for the optimized devices, especially the CTBDP-based device, μh and μe values indicate that a well-balanced hole/electron ratio can significantly reduce the charge recombination, which is helpful to improve the Jsc and FF of the OSCs. Also, in comparison to the reported high-efficiency SMDs based on the A-π-D-π-A-type conjugation architecture,37d,43 the CTBDP and DCTBDP-based active layers also exhibited better hole transport property, probably given that the larger dipole moment of these materials would enhance the intermolecular electronic coupling, and therefore reduce the molecular carrier reorganization energy,43a,43b and the calculated dipole moments of our BODIPY molecules are also given in the ESI.†

Conclusions
In summary, two novel A-π-D-π-A-type BODIPY-SMDs, namely CTBDP and DCTBDP, were successfully designed and synthesized via Stille coupling reaction with the “D-π” segment at the β-position of the BODIPY moiety, in which a carbazole and indolo-[3,2-b]carbazole core (D) connect the electron-deficient BODIPY segment (A) via a thiophene π-bridge, respectively. In this work, the concept of molecular design was applied to the A–D–A-type BODIPY molecular system, and thiophene was introduced as a π-linker to balance the HOMO energy level and molecular bandgap. CTBDP and DCTBDP exhibited a narrow optical bandgap of 1.51 eV and 1.56 eV, respectively, strong and broad absorption capacity, good thermal stability and high carrier mobility. When DCTBDP was blended with the PC71BM acceptor material to fabricate solution-processed OSCs, the optimal PCE of the device was 3.85% with a Voc of 0.75 V and Jsc of 14.59 mA cm−2. It is worth noting that the CTBDP-based device offered an encouraging PCE of 5.85% with a Voc of 0.81 V and a remarkable Jsc of 17.70 mA cm−2, which, to the best of our knowledge, are the highest PCE and Jsc value of A–D–A-type BODIPY-SMDs reported thus far for solution-processed OSCs. Our work clearly shows that A-π-D-π-A-type BODIPY SMDs with a narrow bandgap and deep HOMO energy level can be realized through reasonable structural and molecular design, which provides important guidance for the development of efficient BODIPY-based photovoltaic materials in the future.
