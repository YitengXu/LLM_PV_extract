1 Introduction
Greenhouse gases (CH4, CO2, etc.) in the atmosphere have attracted significant interest because the steadily increasing annual CO2 and CH4 emissions lead to a synchronized increase in the global mean air surface temperature on the Earth and sea level from 1990 to 2100 if planned CO2 emissions are not achieved.1 Therefore, it is urgent to produce potential replacement fuels and reuse carbon through the environmentally friendly conversion of CO2 into fuels.2 Thus, photocatalysts for overall water splitting and the CO2 reduction reaction have been in the spotlight in recent years because of their economic advantages and sustainability.3 Artificial photosynthesis, which has many major thermodynamic and kinetic challenges, has been considered one of the best strategies to solve both global climate change and the potential shortage of energy supply in a green way.4
Metal nitrides (MN) are an essential class of emerging materials that avoid the disadvantages of metals and oxides. MNs are well suited for catalytic applications as they have good electrical conductivity and Pt-like band structures, thus showing catalytic activity in hydro-denitrogenation and hydro-desulfurization similar to that of noble metals.5 Moreover, the suitable bandgap of MN nanomaterials enables both light harvesting and energetic photo-excited carriers, which accelerate redox reactions under visible light. The surface defects, interfacial grain boundaries, morphology, and mono-dispersion of catalysts play a decisive role in their photo-catalytic performances, impressing the importance of the synthetic procedure. Current advances in the synthetic route for MN nanostructures involve sod-gas state, solvothermal, laser ablation, and nonthermal plasma synthetic methods, highlighting the efforts to achieve control over their diameter, morphology, mono-dispersion, stoichiometric composition and construction design.
This review is organized as follows: it starts with the fundamentals of metal nitride nanostructures, including the fundamentals of their band structures, electronic structures, and optical properties. Subsequent chapters present the recent development in preparation strategies for MN nanostructures and discuss their design and construction. Afterwards, the comparative review summarizes the emerging applications of catalysts in water splitting and the CO2 reduction reaction. Finally, we present the perspectives for their possible future directions.
2 Properties of nanostructure MN
2.1 Electronic properties
Investigations on the bond structure of metal nitrides contribute to a better understanding and promoted synthetic strategies for their application. The group-IV elements have been reported to form nitrides with a cubic spinel structure, i.e., γ-M3N4 (M = Hf, Zr, etc.).6 Some exceptions, e.g., scandium and manganese, have not been reported as binary nitride compounds. Metal nitrides from the Cu and Ni groups have FCC structures, which are stable under high temperature and pressure conditions.7 As a result of the FCC structure, the stability of the MNs from these groups endows them pressure resistance in diamond-anvil-cell experiments.8 Pioneered and formulated by Hägg's rule, these structures are formed with N atoms occupying the interstitial position with the parent metal atom. Incorporating N atoms into the crystal structure of a metal changes the metal–metal bond to a covalent state or a mixed character between metal bond and covalent bond.9 Consequently, the bond length increases when N or C atoms occupy the interstitial positions in the parent lattice. The variation in the lattice parameter for several types of metal nitrides is given in Table 1. When nitrogen is loaded into the MN lattice, the lattice constant substantially increases, as shown in Table 1. The lattice parameters provide clues that MN have a more ionic bond nature.

Houston et al.10 indicated that the distance between metal atoms increase during the intercalation of N atoms, resulting in broadening of the metal d-band. This d-band contraction causes a greater density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level compared to the parent metal.11 It is believed that the DOS redistribution in turn give rise to catalytic properties resembling that of noble metals. Particularly, the DOS near the Fermi level can be increased by the contraction of the metal d-band, resulting in similar catalytic properties of MN materials to that of group VIII noble metal catalysts, which are widely used but limited by their high cost.12 Similar bonding characteristics have also been observed in the corresponding 2D charge density maps.13 The group VI, VB and VIB nitrides exhibit a similar change in the location of the highest intensity peaks in the total DOS as a result of the peaks below EF exhibiting Tm(d)–N(p) orbitals. The 2D charge density maps show electronic charge localization towards N atoms, and this tendency increases with an increase in the period in both groups.
Transition metal nitrides often crystallize in the NaCl structure (rock salt structure) and exhibit a mixed bonding nature of metallic, covalent and ionic character.14 However, although due to the experimental efforts in recent years the intrinsic hardness has been promoted, it is still limited to around 10 to 20 GPa.15 The hardness limitation is expected because hardness is a character corresponded to the bonding nature.16 The covalent bond is highly localized in the crystal structure and can inhibit the expansion of dislocation under stress. However, this bonding characteristic is structurally unable to resist sharp shear strain or sudden stress, as embodied by the relatively low shear modulus of 130–200 GPa of MN materials.17 This causes most MN materials with high hardness to also exhibit high brittleness.
Besides mechanical toughness, MN nanostructures possess outstanding stability in aqueous solution during electrochemical reactions. As an example, an MoN nanostructured catalyst was reported to exhibit catalytic properties close to that of platinum.18 The Pt-like property results from the modifications caused by d band changes, which result from the loading of nitrogen into the MN lattice. MoN and Mo2N exhibit electrochemical stability near +0.67 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) (pH = 0).19 As another electrode material with corrosion resistance against acid, the TiN electrode is comparable to the commercial Pt electrode embedded in glassy carbon.20 The Pt-like property and the stability of MN materials make them potential catalysts under various conditions.
The adsorption and desorption of individual molecules have been identified as another key feature for the catalytic process.21 Yadav et al.22 investigated the structural stability and electron/phonon properties of metal nitrides via DFT calculations, confirming the adsorption of CO2 onto the surface of metal nitrides. The large carrier mobility of AlN (1734.5 cm2 V−1 s−1) was found to be dominant due to the holes in the nanostructures. It was found that CO2 adsorbs over the N atom in the horizontal orientation on all 2D sheets, with the adsorption energy of most MN superior (−0.19 eV for AlN, −0.20 eV for GaN and −0.22 eV for InN) to that of MoS2 (−0.13 eV) and graphene (−0.15 eV). The larger adsorption energy of CO2 molecules on different MN compared with that of N2 demonstrates the high selectivity of MN towards CO2 adsorption from flue gas. Thus, this confirms that metal nitrides are potential candidate materials for the adsorption and transformation of CO2.
2.2 Optical properties of semiconductor MN nanomaterials

Nanostructured metal nitrides. 
The semiconducting nature of nanostructured MNs and their bandgaps, which are located in the visible light region, make them suitable photocatalysts and photovoltaic materials. A pair of electrons is generated on the surface of MN nanoparticles upon exposure to incident light. If they do not recombine immediately, the separation of this electron and the remaining hole gives rise to an electron current, which is further utilized in the case of photovoltaic application. An alternative way to use the adsorbed and transferred light energy is consuming the generated electrons in catalytic chemical reactions. In this way, the photoactive material is known as a photocatalyst. In a catalytic water splitting reaction, as an example, light-generated electrons can combine with H+, producing H2 while the holes combine with OH− to produce oxygen.23 Therefore, the photo-induced process enables the production of H2 and O2 upon illumination, as shown by the scheme presented in Fig. 1. Due to the tunable bandgap of MN/metal oxynitride (MON), visible light can be adsorbed to generate excitons and provide energy in heterogeneous catalytic process in a green way.
 Fig. 1  Scheme of the application of a photocatalyst in the water splitting CO2 reduction reaction. 
Highlighting the importance of generated excitons in photo-catalytic reactions, the bandgap of a semiconductor catalyst is a crucial factor deciding its performance. Nanostructured MN have been demonstrated as potential photocatalysts under visible light, indicating they have a bandgap lying between 1.6 and 3.2 eV. As an example, MoxN has a more suitable bandgap (∼2.5 eV) located in the visible light region compared with other molybdenum compounds (3.2 eV for MoO3,24 1.23 eV for bulk MoS2,25 and 0.85 eV for bulk MoSe226). MN is more in a state of covalency than ionic MO because of higher charge of N3− than that of O2−. The high energy of the valence band of MN narrows their bandgap, endowing MN a more metallic character. As an example, the charge transfer between N and Ti endows TiN ionic character, while covalent character still exists. Considering material processing, these observations are helpful since the bond nature of mixing character has a close relationship with properties such as bulk modulus, high hardness (generally above 2000 kg mm−2), conductivity, melting point (typically above 1000 °C), and thermal expansion.27
Various catalysts, including noble metals, MN, metal oxides (MO), and metal carbides (MC), have been applied as catalysts in different circumstances with distinguished properties. In the case of photo-catalytic reactions, photo harvesting provides excited carriers, which accelerate reactions, thus being another key factor for photocatalysts. However, MOs possess bandgap energies too large (>3 eV) for the visible light region, and therefore are active under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation in most cases.28 Thus, to efficiently harvest visible light and accelerate reactions, the semiconductor bandgap, which is the energy a photon requires to be excited to the conduction band, should be smaller than 3.2 eV and larger than the energy barrier. Meanwhile, sufficient energy is needed to accelerate redox reactions, and thus narrowed bandgap is a risk for catalytic reactions. Advanced nanotechnology broadens the ways to achieve suitable bandgaps by tailoring morphologies. The recent studies by Hannah et al. confirmed that the direct bandgap of GaN nanoparticles (3.9 eV) was blue-shifted by 0.6 eV in comparison with their bulk form as a result of quantum confinement effects.29 With morphological changes from bulk, multilayered nanosheets to single-layered nanosheets, the bandgap of GaN changes from 3.4 eV30 and 2.1931 to 2.0 eV.32


Nanostructured metal oxynitrides. 
When MN are incorporated with oxygen, they are called MON, which have further applications due to the substitution of N3− with O2−, which induces the substitution of M2+ with M3+ and the formation of possible anion vacancies.33 The 2p orbitals of N and/or O overlap with the s, p, d orbitals of the metals, causing the dispersion of the valence and conduction bands, becoming a typical semiconductor bandgap.34 The photo-responsive property of MON can be adjusted by tuning the oxygen concentration, making MON nanoparticles a new generation of photo-catalysts. Photo-catalysts are semiconductor materials that can be activated by exposure to a photon of a suitable wavelength, usually in the UV-vis range. The photo-generated hole/electron pairs formed upon photon adsorption participate in oxidizing and reducing reactions, such as water splitting. Currently, the water splitting reaction has attracted interest from researchers due to the potential of alleviating the energy crisis by producing hydrogen in a clean way, inspiring the development of various photocatalysts. ZnGeON nanoparticles, which have a narrower bandgap (2.5–2.7 eV) than ZnGeN2 (3.3 eV) and ZnO (3.2 eV), have been proven to be excellent catalytic materials for the decomposition of dyes under visible light35 and the CO2 reduction reaction.36 More recently, Domen's group37 also showed that ZnGaON in a ZnO/ZnGaON nanowire-array-film photo-anode could cause efficient and reliable sunlight water splitting in the absence of any cocatalyst. By adding zinc and oxygen dopants, the quaternary nanoparticles possess a bandgap of 2.6–2.8 eV,38 which is narrower than the bandgap of pure GaN nanoparticles (3.4 eV)38 or ZnO (3.25 eV)39 and strongly depends on the zinc/gallium ratio (increases with a decrease in the ratio).
Similarly, MON is also a critical photoactive material for photo applications. The incorporation of N in MOx structures will result in distinguished changes in mechanical, optical, electronic properties. In the case of Ta3N5 and TaON, as an example, new orbitals in the higher energy bound state are generated when the nitrogen-based N 2p atomic orbitals are introduced into Ta2O5.40 The potential energy of N 2p is shallower than that of the O 2p atomic orbital. The bandgap is narrower, resulting in a smaller bandgap of Ta3N5 (2.1 eV) and TaON (2.5 eV) compared with Ta2O5 (3.9 eV).41 Generally, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of a transition MON is mainly formed from the empty metal orbitals, while the valence band maximum (VBM) of MON is shifted to a more negative energy by N 2p mixed states.42 Accordingly, the narrower bandgaps of MN/MON nanostructures make them potential photocatalysts under visible light.43,44 The bandgap energy can be easily tuned by varying the N loading in the crystal structure in MN/MON, outlining the importance of the method used to obtain TaON and Ta3N5 with a tailored composition. As well demonstrated by Domen et al.,45 another type of oxynitride nanoparticle ZnGaON, which was synthesized by loading ZnO into the crystal structure of GaN, has a tuned bandgap.46 Since the higher active N 2p orbitals predominate over the O 2p orbitals, a negative shift of the valence band is observed. This gives a clue to obtaining MON materials with related optical properties.
Another effective way to tune the bandgap is by loading extra metal elements into the crystal structure of MN/MON nanoparticles. As an example, a bandgap in the visible light range (2.13 eV) was achieved for Zn-rich Ga oxynitride (ZnGaON) nanoparticles with Zn/Ga = 0.9/0.110. The ZGON solid solution with x = 0.20 exhibited a bandgap energy of around 2.43 eV.47 The quaternary ZGON nanoparticles have smaller bandgap energy than that of GaN and ZnO. The bandgap change was interpreted as an enhanced valence-band maximum, which is caused by the repulsion of the Zn-3d and N-2p orbitals.38 One of the ways to shift the photo-catalytic activity from the ultra-violet to the visible region is by narrowing the bandgap, which can be achieved by indium doping into the ZnGaON crystal structure due to the smaller band gap of InN (0.7 eV).48 Thus, zinc–gallium–indium oxynitride (ZGIN) nanoparticles have a smaller bandgap, and thus greater photo-catalytic activity due to the smaller bandgap of InN (0.7 eV).48


Plasmonic properties. 
The major research efforts on plasmonic photocatalysts have been focused on noble metal photocatalysts with tunable optical responses, enhanced light harvesting, and tunable light absorbance range.49 Group-4 metal nitrides challenge noble metals in photo-catalytic applications not only due to their robustness and high refractory, but also similar plasmonic properties, and they are more tunable by their varying stoichiometry. These MN nanostructures support strong charge oscillations, commonly called localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), when illuminated with visible and near-infrared light. Incident light interacts with surface plasmons and confine them to small volumes, leading to a significant enhancement in the local electromagnetic field.50 After absorbance, the light decays, radiating in photons scattering or generating nonthermal pairs of electrons and holes.51 The generated excitons possess energy that is usually above the Fermi level of nanostructured catalysts, and thus can be extracted for driving chemical reactions.52
Plasmonic MN/MON materials have a similar response but larger corresponding wavelength comparing to metals in an electromagnetic field, which is called local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). LSPR refers to the collective electron oscillations at the interface of metallic structures, which are produced through the electron-magnetic interaction of incident light with certain MN/MON/metal materials.53 The ideal plasmonic Schottky interface (PSI) prevents the collection of “cold” carriers excited from interband transitions and hot carriers with E < ϕB (0.89 eV), as shown in Fig. 2. The ideal plasmonic ohmic interface (POI) has no potential barrier and allows a high photocurrent due to both hot electron and “cold” electron flow. The harnessing of hot electrons, which are produced during the nonradiative decay of surface plasmons in a 40–150 fs timescale,52 was demonstrated theoretically and experimentally as an effective method to improve selective nanocatalysis,53 photo-catalytic overall water splitting,54etc.

Group 4 MN, including TiN,55 ZrN56 and HfN,49 have been proposed as plasmonic MN nanostructures. For instance, TiN nanostructures show broad resonances in the visible spectrum,57 with an Fermi energy aligned with that of TiO2.58 Different from TiO2, which has PSI like gold and silver, TiN forms a POI, thus facilitating the transfer of hot electrons.53 Meanwhile, first-principle density functional theory demonstrated that HfN and ZrN59 have a wide optical phonon to acoustic phonon bandgap and simultaneous smaller optical phonon dispersion that can slow down the hot electron cooling rates, also making them suitable for photo-catalytic applications. Further theoretical and experimental studies, including widening the element range, tuning the composition and morphology, and applying binary nitrides will explain how hot electrons are beneficial for photo-catalytic applications.

3 Synthesis of MN
Tuning the morphology of materials, including their diameter, shape, homogeneity and dispersion, is a key factor for achieving unique photo-properties due to the close link between morphology and photo-property. Meanwhile, different materials and even the component ratios for the same composition of material also distinguish the photo-properties of the final product.
Compared with pristine metal or MO, the synthesis of MC/MN nanostructures is relatively challenging because of their robust nature. Furthermore, the synthesis of MN nanostructures is difficult due to their thermal instability and trend of becoming oxidized/carbonized. In general, synthetic routes can be divided into physical approaches (laser ablation, arc-discharge, evaporation, electrospinning and pulsed-laser deposition) and chemical methods. Physical methods provide more define and chemically pure products, but with a restricted variety of products. Alternatively, chemical routes enable a wider range of elements with surface functionalization. However, the difficulty in achieving morphology control and the use of toxic reactants are often encountered for chemical pathways.
3.1 Solid–gas-state synthesis
Among the chemical approaches to prepare MN nanostructures, the direct nitridation of solid-state precursors is the most common one. General efforts have been focused on the heat treatment of a wide variety of metal precursors, including pristine metal elements,60 single or mixed oxides,61–65 hydroxides,66,67 metal chlorides,68 polymer complexes,69 and metal–amine complexes.70 Ammonia has been widely used because it creates a reducing atmosphere, while also acting as a nitrogen source.71,72 Alternatively, N-rich complexes including hydrazine,73 urea,74 ammonium salt,75 carbon nitride,76 and their mixture77,78 provide more choices to control size and shape of the products. Advanced carbon materials give can act as a nitrogen source with confinements effects. The synthesis of V, Cr, Nb, Mo and Zr nitride nanoparticles with C3N4 as the nitrogen source was reported by Fischer et al., discovering that the concentration of the precursor has a direct influence on the composition of MN nanoparticles.79 Yu et al.80 reported a method for the preparation of binary NixMo1−xN nanorods with a morphology inherited from the oxide precursor vertically grown on substrates, as shown in detail in Fig. 3. Alternative templates have a wide range over inorganic and organic composites, including metals,81 metal organic frameworks (MOF),82,83 metal alkali,84 and protein.85

The reaction parameters, not only the nitrogen source but also other reaction parameters such as temperature, have been demonstrated to have a decisive effect on the morphology and composition of the product.86 Larger diameters were observed with higher temperature, while the spherical shape was consequently lost because of agglomeration and sintering. This long-reported phenomenon has been observed in a wide range of materials, including pure metal, MO, MN, and MON nanostructures.87 A core–shell CeO2/CeN nanorod structure was successfully prepared by Huang et al.88 by partially nitriding CeO2 nanorod shells, as shown in Fig. 4. However, the CeO2/CeN nanowire precursor became nanorods after high temperature treatment. Beside stoichiometric composition, a heterojunction, which enhances electron migration and is beneficial for catalytic efficiency, was also reported to be achieved by controlling the nitridation parameter.

The idea of inheriting precursor morphology is commonly seen with metal organic framework (MOF) precursors due to their controllable size, morphology and high porosity. Lai et al.89 reported the synthesis of strongly coupled NiN/CoN nanocages with a diameter of 350 nm using cube-shaped ZIF-67 as a precursor (Fig. 5). However, as the product from the heat treatment of the MOF precursor, residual C, which benefits electrochemical catalytic efficiency, remains a problem for photocatalysts due to its light quenching effect.

The nitridation of carbide is also seen in MXenes, which are 2D MC/MN used for their hydroxyl- or oxygen-terminated surfaces. The nitride MXene Ti4N3Tz was firstly synthesized by heating Ti4AlN3 powder in a molten salt eutectic mixture of LiF, NaF and KF at 550 °C under Ar gas.90 The subsequent etching process by applying TBAOH delaminated the multilayered structure into single- and few-layered nanoflakes and removed the non-etched Ti4AlN3. Urbankowski et al. reported an ammoniation synthesis route to obtain V2NTz and Mo2NTz nitrided V2CTz and Mo2CTz carbide MXene nanosheets at 600 °C.5
The development of nanotechnology in recent decades has inspired the tailoring of MN/MON nanostructures. However, problems including agglomeration caused by high anisotropy91 and ineffective charge design at the boundaries of binary catalysts92 remain a challenge for direct solid-state synthesis. Moreover, the multi-synthesis steps involved in the solid-state synthesis of MN and the use of NH3, which is toxic and corrosive at high temperatures, require further improvements towards better control, safety, and low cost.93
3.2 Solvothermal method

Tailored synthesis via sol–gel-like precursor. 
New synthetic strategies aimed at using facile procedures with the ability to tailor compositions and tune the morphology emphasize the use of precursors in multi phases.94,95 Sol–gel precursors with metal and nitrogen contents form homogeneous precursors, which are further calcinated into fine powders and nanoparticles are obtained. Alternative N-sources, such as urea and polymers, have been explored and proven to be safe, facile and low-cost nitrogen sources to obtain metal nitrides.96 Compared with solid-state synthesis, the sol–gel-phase precursor possess allows precise control over the size and shape due to the milder conditions created by the slow release of N/C from the matrix. Moreover, nucleation, seed growth, and nitridation in a sol–gel phase result in finer size and shape, which are beneficial for catalytic activity.
One of commonly used techniques, the urea glass route, is based on a glass-like and urea-based precursor, which is then calcined in a crucible or on a substrate.97 This route was firstly introduced by Giordano et al.98 and extended to other elements including Fe,99 Ni,100 Ta,101 Zr,102 and Ga.103 Jin et al.104 reported the preparation of VN, CrN, NbN, MoN and ZrN nanoparticles using a soft urea route. Wook et al.105 reported the synthesis of CoxN, where the product changed from mesoporous Co3N nanotubes to metallic-phase Co4N with an increase in temperature. Simultaneously, heat treatment also caused Co3N/Co4N nanocubes to aggregate into larger and denser ones, as shown in Fig. 6. These results indicate that the role of the amorphous N-doped carbon layer is to prevent the aggregation and collapse of the 3D mesoporous structures. The rate of a restricted step of the reaction, the condensation rate, can be tuned using suitable catalysts or polymers additives.106

Liquid or sol–gel-like precursors not only provide precise parameter control over the synthetic process, but also enable MN to be synthesized and applied directly on substrates, including carbon nanofibers77 carbon nanosheets,107 and graphene oxide.108 Zhang et al. reported the synthesis of TiN coated on phosphate nanoparticles with Ti(NMe2)4 dissolved in tetrahydrofuran as the precursor and propylamine or ammonia as the cross-linking agent.109 As an example, Yang et al. reported the synthesis of VN nanoparticles from a mixture of V2O5 xerogel and melamine heated at 800 °C with average diameter of 20 nm.70 Residual carbon acts as the conductive part in the supercapacitor. Xu et al. reported the synthesis of 2D MN (CrN, TiN and NbN) nanostructures via precursor-coated precursor nitriding with heat treatment, followed by washing the salt templates, as given in Fig. 7a.110 The ammonization temperature had a decisive effect on the morphology, which changed from nanosheets to 2D nanoarrays with an increase in temperature.

Catalysts favor the strategy of applying a residual carbon component. Although the black color indicates light quenching, the larger surface area and high conductivity of the carbon content promote the catalytic efficiency. Cheng et al. reported the synthesis of MN-coated fibres by reducing the TiCl4 sol–gel precursor on cellulose, which transformed into a carbon fiber substrate in the subsequent heat treatment.68 The transformation of the sol–gel precursor into a 2D film substrate allows the flexible design of thin films, which contribute to the easier separation of electrodes and catalyst reuse.
The sol–gel method is a green and controllable solution to obtain MN/MON materials. However, the active phase undergoes several changes during the process, and situ characterization is still challenging due to the fast oxidation of the species extracted from the intermediate steps, highlighting the importance to study the role and the characterization of phases within sol–gel synthesis.


Wet synthesis. 
Heat treatment, which is beneficial for the formation of metal-nitrogen bonds, is often employed for the preparation of MN nanoparticles; however, it is not favorable for some MN materials. Wet synthesis without heat treatment is more compatible for MN nanostructures that easily decompose, including Cu3N,111 PdN,112 and Zn3N2.113 Recently, Mondal et al. reported a synthetic route to prepare Cu3N by reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I) followed by nitridation of Cu(I) with hexamethylenetetramine under an Ar atmosphere at 200 °C.114 The solution-based synthesis of MN gives rise to the precise tailoring of materials such as hybrid,115 asymmetric, nanocage constructs and core–shell structures,116 which can be adapted for the fabrication of chip-shaped electrochemical catalysts. Zhang et al.115 reported a method for the preparation of Fe4N/Fe2O3/Fe/porous N-doped carbon nanosheets, as given in Fig. 8.

A synthetic route for the preparation of Cu3N nanocubes with a tunable size controlled by different primary amines was reported by Wu et al.111 early in 2011. Cu3N nanocubes with an average diameter of 26 nm and a direct bandgap of 1.5 eV were obtained using 1-octadecylamine as both the solvent and capping agent. The size was reduced significantly to 18.6 nm with the use of hexadecylamine instead of 1-octadecylamine, and even smaller (10.8 nm) with oleylamine. The typical nucleation, growth, aggregation and spontaneous decomposition process in the synthesis of Cu3N was reported later (shown in Fig. 9a–e). The preparation of Cu3N nanocubes was demonstrated to be achieved only in a narrow window after sharply 15 min of heat treatment.117 Similarly, CoCl2 and hexamethylenetetramine were applied by Yang et al.118 in an H2/CH3COOH solution to obtain CoxN nanoboxes, which were partially oxidized into a CoxN/CoO core–shell structure in an air atmosphere, indicating the instability of some MN nanostructures and difficulty in their preparation via wet synthesis.

Also, a solution provides a mild circumstance for tailoring the morphology of precursor that is inherited. The two-step synthesis of TiN involving the preparation of urchin-like TiO2 precursors in aqueous solutions was reported to achieve a 3D architecture of TiN, as presented in Fig. 9h–j.119 The solution method is a relatively mild circumstance compared with the solid–gas method, enabling the synthesis of MN nanostructures with various morphologies, including nanorods,120 nanowires,58,121 nanoboxes,118 nanospheres,122 nanosheets,123 and nanocubes.124,125
Flux synthetic growth can be regarded as a type of high-temperature solvothermal method, which is frequently used for the growth of MO, MN and MON nanocrystals. In a typical flux synthetic growth, an inorganic salt is heated and melted to serve as a solvent for dissolving the precursor solutes. With a suitable flux, crystal growth is enabled at a temperature much lower than the melting points of the precursors. The flux synthetic method affords good control over the crystal morphology and surface properties. Shi et al.126 reported the preparation of ultrathin Ta3N5 nanoflakes (2 × 200 nm) for the first time with CsI–Cs2CO3 as the flux and metal Ta plate as the precursor, with the SEM images shown in Fig. 10. The top end of these nanoflakes are much thinner due to the low growth rate of the 2D nucleus perpendicular to the nanoflake.

Wet chemical routes can be scaled up in a facile manner compared to solid–gas-state methods. However, wet synthesis jeopardizes the purity of the product nanostructures and exerts less control over their morphology. Therefore, devising a more scalable and general approach for the synthesis of high-quality nanostructured MN with enriched active sites is imperative.

3.3 Laser ablation
Laser ablation was one of the earliest methods used to prepare plasmonic MN/MON nanoparticles. A laser with extremely high local illumination density is irradiated on a solid target immersed in liquid medium in a typical process, resulting in a local temperature increase and surface evaporation of the target material.127 The evaporated species (atoms, ions, and clusters) cool down rapidly in the surrounding medium, initiating nucleation and subsequent nanoparticle growth.128 Goodwin et al. reported the synthesis of GaN nanoparticles by laser ablation in an N2 atmosphere.129 The ultrasmall diameter (2–12 nm) and continuous size-selective photoluminescence indicated a homogeneous dispersion and precise control of morphology by the laser ablation method. The advances in femtosecond laser technology in recent decades have inspired laser ablation microfabrication with high structural accuracy and small heat-affected zone.
A variation of this application is using laser ablation to create coatings or films by laser ablating a target material and letting it deposit on the substrate surface, which is called pulsed laser deposition. A TiN film with a thickness of 30–50 nm was reported to be deposited by a KrF excimer laser under 5 × 10−6 torr chamber pressure with the grain size of 10 nm and thickness of 90 nm in the absence of a lattice-matched substrate.130 The synthesis of an MON nanostructured system, i.e., a nano-crystallized TiON thin film, was also reported recently by Mucha et al.131 using the pulsed laser deposition process. The working conditions such as N2 pressure were demonstrated to play a decisive role in the size and N content of the nanostructured products. In the preparation of WNx reported by Samano et al., the stoichiometry and hardness changes from W6N to W2N with an increase in N2 pressure from 19.5 GPa to 27.7 GPa.132 The synthesis of other MN nanostructures has been reported using CrN,133 RhN,134 TaN,135 TiCrxN1-x,136 and NbN.137 More laser ablation methods to obtain binary/trinity MN/MON nanostructures are prerequisite to open a new avenue for the realization of novel optical devices.
3.4 Nonthermal plasma method
Direct current plasma applied radio frequency sputtering allows the synthesis of nanopowders with high-temperature plasma enabling the rapid evaporation of the target material and increased chemical reactivity. As the vapor travels away from the hot regions of the plasma, rapid cooling results in a supersaturated state and the subsequent nucleation and growth of nanoparticles.138 Meanwhile, radio frequency sputtering (RF) is the technique of alternating the electrical potential of a current under vacuum at radio frequencies to avoid charge buildup on certain types of sputtering target materials. The arc plasma spews droplets, creating quality control issues on the thin films, even leading to the complete cessation of the sputtering of atoms, thus terminating the process. The plasma environment is a complex medium, comprising reactive ionized elements, electrons, radicals and neutral species in nonthermal equilibrium. The working conditions including plasma intensity, pressure and the residence time of the reactive species are accessible variables, allowing the modification of the morphology of MN nanoparticles. Masubuchi et al. reported ZrN and NbN deposited by RF magnetron sputtering from an M/Si composite substrate using N2 as the reactive sputtering gas.139 Upon annealing, plasmonic absorption occurred at the interface between the NbN nanoparticles and the dielectric Si(N,O) matrix, and the transmittance decreased at around 700 nm. Musa et al. reported the synthesis of AlN nanoparticles via RF sputtering with a size in the range of 2–3 nm.140 The ultrasmall AlN nanoparticles deposited on multi-wall carbon nanotubes enhanced the UV emission by transferring electrons to the emission materials. Haye reported ε-FeNx nanoparticles prepared by deposition on a carbon xerogel through the plasma-induced degradation of iron acetylacetonate in a nitrogen-based plasma discharge.141 Increasing the average crystal domain size (10.5 nm to 13 nm) was determined by the working pressure during the plasma synthesis (12 mTorr to 45 mTorr), making it easy to control the morphologies of the FexN nanoparticles. Details of this process are presented in Fig. 11. The preparation of other MN nanostructures, including TiN,142,143 CrN,144 FexN,141 GaN,145 VN,146 HfN,49 TiZrN,147 and ZnSnN2,148 have also been reported recently by plasmonic RF sputtering methods. Further development is needed for applying plasma RF sputtering, including multi-metallic content incorporation, doping and introduction of vacancies.

Currently, most of the physical methods described herein yielded spherically shaped nanoparticles. However, nonthermal plasma still encounters difficulty in producing other morphologies. Research on tailored morphologies, such as cubic-shaped TiN,149 has shown a direct relationship between morphology and optical properties. Precise control over shape is associated with limited expensive methods including lithographic patterning and focused ion beam milling, which are usually limited by specific substrates and scalability. Thus, there is a significant impetus to develop strategies that enable the bottom-up, large-scale generation of MN/MON nanostructures with precise morphological control and optical responses. The current state of development of synthetic methodologies for the generation of MN/MON nanostructures presents significant room for future investigation.
4 MN used as photocatalysts
MN nanostructures have been widely explored theoretically and experimentally as novel photocatalysts in the last two decades compared with metal oxide and noble metal photocatalysts. Inspired by DFT calculation, the designs for the construction of semiconductor MN-based photocatalysts significantly facilitate photo-generated electron–hole separation by realizing interfacial charge transfer, a key factor in the photocatalytic process. Consequently, tremendous efforts have been overwhelmingly focused on developing MN-based photocatalysts in various photo-driven reactions, such as water splitting, CO2 reduction reaction and decomposition of small molecules.
4.1 Overall water splitting
Hydrogen gas is one of the best fuel alternatives because of its high energy gravimetric density and clean combustion output. The most efficient hydrogen gas production is the renewable method of water electrolysis powered by green wind energy or photovoltaic cells. However, complex facilities and the high cost of these methods restrict the large-scale use of hydrogen gas. Alternatively, direct solar-hydrogen energy conversion by photo-catalytic water splitting exhibits a much lower efficiency, which is limited by the current photocatalysts. Experimental results and theoretical calculations support that limitations including mass transfer, back-oxidation reactions and charge recombination block way towards promoted photo-catalytic efficiency.150 The high surface area resulting from the nanoscale morphology increases the reaction sites on the surface, making nanoparticles potential catalysts. Meanwhile, considering the bandgap of MN (eV) and MON (eV) nanostructures, especially multi-metallic oxynitride nanostructures,74 the tunable bandgaps of MN/MON enable more flexible strategies to balance light harvesting and the activation energy. For instance, the bandgap of quaternary ZnGaON nanoparticles (2.6–2.8 eV) was reported to be directly decided by the Zn:Ga ratio and obviously narrowed compared with that of GaN (3.4 eV) and ZnO (3.25 eV), resulting in an improved hydrogen yield.74
Besides mass transfer and charge recombination, back-oxidation reactions also limit photo-catalytic reactions. Gerischer et al. demonstrated in their early work that the back reaction of H2 and O2 into water hindered the catalytic efficiency.151 Various nanostructured materials including metals,152 MO,153 metal chalcogenides,154 metal dichalcogenides,155 metal organic frameworks (MOF),156 and graphene157 are generally excellent HER catalysts and typical catalysts for the back reaction (oxygen reduction reaction). Experimental results have shown that the nanoscale (oxyhydro)oxide shells on photocatalysts can successfully suppress the back-oxidation reaction.158 Amorphous hydrated nanoclusters act as a selective membrane, which is not permeable to dissolved gases (including O2), thus preventing back-oxidation reactions.159 Metal oxide (MO) coatings also insulate various redox-active species and protect the surface from poisoning.160
Meanwhile, loading a cocatalyst provides a reasonable way to suppress the back-oxidation reaction and develop a hydrogen production system in a more efficient way. Some MN exhibit metallic properties including conductivity, chemical stability and electron capture ability. DFT calculations revealed that the surface electronic coupling of N with V atoms can effectively reduce the kinetic energy barrier for water adsorption and dissociation, which render VN highly promising as an ideal cocatalyst candidate to combine with semiconductor photocatalysts.161 Thus nanostructures with electrochemical stability and proper band gaps have been investigated as catalysts in photo-driven water splitting in recent decades, including noble metals,162 metal oxides,163 polymers,164 quantum dots,165 g-C3N4166 and carbon nanostructures. As an example, the use of the Ta3N5/WO3 heterojunction as a photocatalyst was reported by Hsu et al. with an H2 evolution rate of 31.9 mol h−1. The backward reactions in the heterojunction system with redox mediators were primarily suppressed because of the absence of redox mediators.167 Alternatively, polymers such as PANI and PPy were demonstrated to be effective cocatalysts with Ta3N5 with improved hydrogen production rates (30.2 and 28.9 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively) in the absence of sacrificial agents. Polymers covered on the surface of MN/MON catalysts facilitate charge transfer for the quick migration of photo-generated excitons to the polymer surface, thus preventing contact between excitons and recombination sites in catalysts.164
Additionally, a neighboring semiconductor cocatalyst helps to increase the carrier lifetime, thus facilitating its transfer to reactant molecules.168 Furthermore, it improves the photo-catalytic performance of the semiconductor by allowing the use of photons with energies below its bandgap.169 Jiang et al. demonstrated that extended optical absorption throughout the visible light region was beneficial for the photoactivity of Ta3N5/Ta2O5 with an H2 evolution rate of 39.41 mol h−1 due to the cocatalyst and LSPR.170 A similar enhancement in LSPR applied in water splitting has also been reported with other MN photocatalysts.171 More examples of the photo-catalytic applications of MN nanostructures are presented in Table 2.

The recent developments in nanotechnology have enabled the design of core–shell structured catalysts in a more flexible and tunable way, benefiting their corresponding photo-catalytic performance. MO coating on the surface of MN improves the charge transfer by passivating the defects on the surface and tunes the surface from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, thus contributing to a more homogeneous dispersion.192 As an example, Wang et al. reported the application of a GaInN nanowire array coated with an Rh/CrOx shell in photo-catalytic overall water splitting with a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 5.2%.188 The details are presented in Fig. 12. The photo-catalytic efficiency was improved with a lower open voltage and stability by the conformal coating material, which lowered the OER barrier and introduced a water-proof shell. Chen et al.193 demonstrated that the deposition of CoPi/Co(OH)2 shells on Ta3N5 nanorods played a positive role in promoting the transfer of photo-carriers, suppressing surface self-oxidation, and thus improving the PEC water splitting performance, as shown in Fig. 13. Although the core–shell nanorods showed an IPCE spectrum in a wide absorption range, as shown in Fig. 13e, their efficiency at a longer wavelength was relatively lower than that in the UV region (400–420 nm). This is caused by the cocatalyst shell, which reduced the light absorption of the Ta3N5 absorber. A higher evolution rate (72.4 μmol h−1 cm−2) was achieved by Pihosh et al.178 with a Ta3N5-NRs/BTON/FeNiOx-based heterojunction photocatalyst, confirming light harvesting as the leading factor for the efficient generation and extraction of charge carriers. However, there is still considerable room for optimising the design architecture to balance light absorption and photo-generated exciton transfer.

Another limitation for catalytic water splitting is the charge recombination194 caused by the unavoidable characteristics of nanostructured photocatalysts including short lifetime of excitons,195 interfacial barriers,196 low mobility,197 and bulk and interface defects.198,199 Thus, strategies including eliminating recombination sites, construction of nanostructures and doping have been explored to overcome these limitations.200 Experimental results have demonstrated that MN/MON nanostructures, including nanospheres,122 nanorods,201 nanosheets,161 and nanoparticles182 promote the catalytic efficiency with a shortened charge transfer distance. Ebaid et al.202 reported the use of Ir-doped GaInN nanorods with a diameter of 77 nm as a photocatalyst in photo-catalytic water splitting with a relatively low H2 evolution rate of 1.47 × 10−2 mol cm−2 s−1 and STH of 3.5%, as shown in Fig. 14. The enhanced catalytic performance benefited from the shorter transfer distance resulting from the rod-shaped morphology and surface treatment using EDT passivated surface oxidation by removing dangling bonds.

Alternatively, doping is also an effective way to improve the photo-catalytic efficiency of MN. The photo-catalytic efficiency of Ta3N5, one of most widely explored photocatalyst, has been promoted via metal doping including Mg,203 Zr,204 W,205 Na and K.206 The recent study by Brown et al. revealed that the N vacancies in MN/MON dominate the ionic mobility, especially in the high-charge region such as the catalytic/reactant interface.197 Thus, vacancies by oxidative decomposition207 and photo etching,208etc. have been introduced in MN/MON nanostructures to promote their photo-catalytic performance. Single-crystal Ta3N5 nanorods without grain boundaries and surface defect states were firstly applied by Wang et al.209 as a photoactive material in water splitting with an STH of 0.014%, which is relatively small. However, traditionally, charge defects introduced by aliovalent doping and the charge compensation phenomenon are regarded as recombination sites, and thus damage the charge transfer.210 The controversial role of doping in MN/MON nanostructured photocatalysts remains unexplored mainly regarding enhanced catalytic performance.
4.2 CO2 reduction reaction
With the wide view to confront the energy crisis, the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere offers another choice to obtain clean energy besides water splitting. Thus, researchers have been increasingly focused on the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce fuels and consume the concomitant CO2 emission. Halmann et al. initially reported that the photo-catalytic CO2RR could be achieved over p-GaAs under a highly cathodic applied bias.211 Nanostructured titanium oxides dispersed in solution212 were then applied in the photoreduction of CO2, followed by the use of polymeric C3N4,213 metals,214 metal oxides,215 layered double hydroxides (LDHs),216 M3C2 MXene,217 inorganic perovskite halides,218 and MOFs.219,220 However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of different products and grand thermodynamic barrier of the CO2RR make the catalytic reaction challenging compared with photo-driven water splitting.
Compared with water splitting, which produces H2, photo-catalytic CO2RR is a potential solution to directly produce transportable fuels such as alcohols and formic acid. However, the high electrochemical potential (E° = −1.9 V vs. NHE at pH 7) and reactivity of the one-electron product, CO2˙−, makes the catalyst design tricky. Alternatively, the reduction of CO2 yields various products, depending on how many electrons are involved.221Eqn (1)–(6) show that the potential (vs. NHE at pH 7) required for the CO2RR can be reduced if a multi-electron process through proton-coupled electron transfer is employed. CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → CO + H2O E = −0.52 eV(1) CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → HCOOH E = −0.61 eV(2) CO2 + 4H+ + 2e− → HCHO + H2O E = −0.51 eV(3) CO2 + 6H+ + 6e− → CH3OH + H2O E = −0.38 eV(4) CO2 + 8H+ + 8e− → CH4 + H2O E = −0.24 eV(5) 2CO2 + 12H+ + 12e− → C2H4 + 4H2O E = −0.34 eV(6)
For example, methanol, one of the widely used products of CO2 hydrogeneration (70 MMT in 2015),222 is favored with a 6-electron reaction with an activated energy of −0.38 eV. Although methanol has been commercially produced from syngas (H2/CO) containing CO2 up to 30% of the total carbon over Cu–ZnO–Al2O3 catalysts at 200–300 °C under 5.0–10.0 MPa, the low methanol yields and pure CO2 requirement as the carbon source limit further its applications.222 From a thermodynamic point of view, a lower reaction temperature with a higher reaction pressure is beneficial for the synthesis methanol. However, a high reaction temperature will facilitate the activation of CO2 and subsequent methanol formation. Thus, highly selective catalysts are needed to avoid the formation of by-products and benefit the catalytic effect. Furthermore, the problem that the catalyst is easily oxidized after reaction with CO2 remains a challenge for fuel production and the CO2RR.223
Nanotechnology, including structure design, bandgap tailoring, and composition tuning of nanostructured catalysts, has resulted in higher efficiency and stability throughout the catalytic CO2RR. Nanostructured MOs have already been reported as active photocatalysts for the CO2RR in the last few decades.224 The large band gap (>3 eV) of MO photocatalysts enables the reduction of CO2 and oxidation of H2O (1.23 eV). However, it also limits the light-harvesting in the visible region (1.6–3.1 eV). Alternatively, the N 2p orbitals are energetically shallower than the deeper O 2p orbitals, suggesting the potential of MN or MON nanostructures as photocatalysts with a narrower bandgap, and thus better catalytic performances.225 Spherical architecture TaON nanoparticles were investigated by Han et al.226 with a CH3CHO and C2H5OH evolution rate of 0.52 and 2.03 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively, which are higher than that with commercial catalysts. The mesoporous structure and high surface area (11.12 m2 g−1) shorten the charge transfer distance, thus improving the catalytic efficiency, impressing the importance of nanotechnology and the key role of the surface area of photocatalysts. The experimental result reported by Alotaibi et al.227 put GaInN nanowire arrays under the spotlight for visible light harvesting in the green and blue region and photo-catalytic efficiency, reducing CO2 into CO, CH4 and CH3OH with a production rate of 5, 0.86 and 0.5 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively. n-Type Ge-doped GaInN nanowires with 10–50 times smaller factor highlighted the dominance of surface band bending in the separation and transport of photo excitons. The measured upward surface band bending of the Ge-doped nanowires (n-type), as schematically shown in Fig. 15c left panel, creates an energy barrier that inhibits the transport of photo-generated electrons to the photocatalyst surface, thereby significantly suppressing reduction reactions. Alternatively, the downward band bending associated with the Mg-doped GaInN nanowires (p-type) leads to hole depletion in the near-surface region, as shown in Fig. 15c right panel. Although wider bandgaps contribute to achieving sufficient redox ability for a specific reaction occurring on a single photocatalyst, a narrow bandgap is required to harvest visible light, which is 85% of solar irradiance.228

The narrower bandgaps of MN/MON catalysts endow them competitive CO2RR catalytic properties compared with MO in light harvesting. Meanwhile, the design of heterogeneous cocatalysts, including type-II heterogeneous structures and direct Z-scheme strategy, have also been proposed as a bandgap tailoring strategy.229 As given in Fig. 16, the excited electrons in PC I with a higher CB position migrated to PC II with a lower CB position. Meanwhile, the photo-generated holes in these two230 semiconductors follow reverse migration. The photo-excited electrons and holes are accumulated on PC II for a reduction reaction and PC I for an oxidation reaction, respectively, promoting the spatial separation and suppressed recombination of charge carriers,231 which significantly enhances the energy conversion efficiency of the designed heterojunction. However, the corresponding charge carrier redox of the type-II heterojunction leads to a weak driving force, thus has the risk of failing to drive a specific photo-catalytic reaction.230 Alternatively, in the direct Z-scheme charge carrier transfer pathway, the photo-generated electrons with strong reduction abilities in the CB of PC I and holes with strong oxidation abilities in the VB of PC II are preserved, while the photo-generated electrons in the CB of PC II and holes in the VB of PC I with inferior redox power recombine, as shown in Fig. 16d. Consequently, a Z-scheme photocatalyst simultaneously has strong redox ability for driving photo-catalytic reactions and spatially separated reductive and oxidative active sites. Moreover, a semiconductor photocatalyst with a narrow bandgap can be selected to construct direct Z-scheme photocatalysts to broaden their light-harvesting range. Bard232 initially proposed the Z-scheme concept, mimicking the natural photosynthesis in green plants for water splitting, which was experimentally achieved by Muraoka et al.233 in the light-induced generation of HCOOH via a CO2 photo-reduction using an n-type YTaON/Ru complex photocatalyst. The prolonged lifetime of shallowly trapped and free electrons, as well as introduction of YTaON as an interfacial modifier and corresponding suppressed desorption of the complex contribute to improved photoactivity. More examples of the application of heterojunction photocatalysts are given in Table 3.

Sekizawa et al. applied a TaON/Ru complex as a Z-scheme photocatalyst in CO2RR by hybridising a supramolecular metal complex and methanol under visible light for the first time.234 The experimental results demonstrated that the TaON/Ag-RuBLRu’ complex improves the catalytic efficiency as a whole component. Alternative MN/MON nanostructured photoactive materials including perovskite oxynitrides have been explored. The use of a nitride perovskite as a photocatalyst was reported by Oshima et al. in the production of HCOOH with a CO2 production rate of 1.44 μmol g−1 h−1.235 The 2D Z-scheme photocatalyst possess a lower density of mid-gap states, working as recombination centers of photo-generated electron/hole pairs, but a higher density of reactive electrons, which are responsible for the higher photo-catalytic performance compared to the 2D nanostructured sample (0.32 μmol g−1 h−1 with CaTaON2/Ag/Ru).235
Although significant achievements have been made by combining cocatalysts and MN with nanostructures, these studies are far from achieving practical and economic photo-catalytic production goals. The primary challenges in CO2 photoreduction still have not been thoroughly investigated to date, including the fundamental reaction mechanisms and pathways involving the multiple proton-coupled electron transfers with high energy barriers, complex activation and adsorption of CO2 molecules, low efficiency and selectivity of different products, the richness of excited-state dynamics and the semiconductor surface chemistry. For example, removing the sacrificial electron donor including TEOA and EDTA is essential. Also, the construction of a reaction cell conducting the CO2RR and water oxidation in separate compartments can contribute to avoiding any undesirable back reactions and achieving higher efficiency in the CO2RR. Another possible solution to simultaneously separate the reduction and oxidation sites in a particle suspension system is the use of a semiconductor-based Z-scheme system. In any case, an improvement in the quality of semiconductors to minimize undesirable electron–hole recombination and extension of the available light wavelength range are also necessary.
5. Conclusions
This review discussed the relationship between band structure, optical properties, novel synthetic routes, and photoactive metal nitride materials. Due to the critical role of morphology and size in catalytic materials, the development of preparation methods was also discussed and summarized, including solid–gas-state synthesis, wet process, laser ablation and nonthermal plasma method. Generally, synthesis through nonthermal plasma methods245 results in higher mono-dispersion and homogeneity, whereas laser ablation results in polydisperse samples.245 Also, the solid–gas and wet methods have a dispersed product nanoparticle diameter intermediately. Experimental results revealed the existence of oxide contents in the shells as a result of exposure to air. These can broaden and dampen the LSPR. Therefore, surface protection is crucial to prepare TMN NPs with strong plasmonic extinction. Meanwhile, precise control of the morphology and diameter of MN/MON nanoparticles is necessary to tune their optical and physical properties, thus contributing to higher catalytic efficiency.
The primary requirement for achieving CO2 reduction and H2 evolution, although in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor, was determined to be the construction of active sites for the reduction of CO2 and H2 on the semiconductor surface. Ru-containing supramolecular complexes serve as suitable catalytic units for the selective production of formate. Spectroscopic studies revealed that in these Z-scheme systems, Ag nanoparticles loaded on the semiconductor surface function as an electron pool to improve the charge separation and as a promoter of interfacial electron transfer from the conduction band of the semiconductor to the excited state of the Ru complex. Although the solar energy conversion efficiencies of the photo-catalytic reactions are still very low, significant progress has been achieved in recent decades. The use of semiconductor Z-scheme systems and heterojunction nanostructures with an applied bias will be promising ways to achieve H2 evolution and CO2 reduction with reduced charge combination and avoided back reactions. Nevertheless, many challenges still remain, which need to be overcome. For example, it is necessary to remove the sacrificial electron donor (i.e., TEOA and methanol). Furthermore, improvement in the quality of semiconductors to minimize undesirable electron–hole recombination and extend the available light wavelength range is also required.
Therefore, although the photo-catalytic H2 evolution and CO2 conversion into valuable energy-bearing hydrocarbons are very promising and attractive, it is unquestionable that there is still a long way to bring this technology to reality. This review showed that detailed mechanistic studies and the development of highly effective and selective cocatalysts are essential for achieving the highly selective reduction of CO2 and H2 evolution. Fundamental studies are needed to address the bottleneck problems in this field, including kinetic difficulties in multi-electron reduction processes, low reduction selectivity and low quantum yield of photocatalysts. Accordingly, breakthroughs are expected soon when all these factors are comprehensively considered and studied.
