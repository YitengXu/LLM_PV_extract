Nanotechnology has garnered immense attention as a sustainable approach to addressing the challenges faced by the agricultural sector. Carbon dots (CDs) are novel carbon nanomaterials having unique properties. They have a small size with a core–shell-like structure and exhibit tunable photoluminescence (PL) similar to quantum dots (QDs). CDs additionally possess high aqueous solubility, biocompatibility, and negligible toxicity. Considering their remarkable bio-compatibility, CDs are relatively safer nanomaterials for application in agriculture. In recent years, CDs have shown significant growth-enhancing effects on plants. As agricultural yields rely on the photosynthetic efficiency of plants, CDs with their PL can augment photosynthesis and utilize solar energy efficiently for increasing crop productivity, making them effective photosynthetic enhancers. In addition to PL, the hydrophilicity of CDs also enhances plant growth by accelerating seed germination and water absorption by plants. Moreover, their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties assist them to relieve biotic and abiotic stresses, improving plant health. Thus, CDs' application would help enhance plant growth substantially. CD-based agricultural sensors can also detect herbicides and pesticides, which supports the future development of smart sensors. This review presents the broad application of CDs in agriculture as seed priming agents, photosynthetic enhancers, plant stress ameliorators, and sensors. This review also discusses the green synthesis and properties of CDs. Lastly, the challenges and future perspectives on the potential use of CDs in the agricultural system have been discussed.Anju MaholiyaAnju Maholiya completed her post-graduation in M.Sc.

Environmental significance
This review presents an approach towards sustainable agriculture which is very much needed for ensuring food security and maintaining the resilience of the environment. This review addresses some challenges faced by the agriculture sector along with its relevance to the environment. Carbon dots (CDs) exhibit remarkable biocompatibility and negligible environmental toxicity when used in optimum concentration, making them appropriate for the growth of plant species in particular, without raising any environmental concern. Moreover, CDs as nano-fertilizers are promising alternatives for chemical fertilizers for plant growth enhancement, which can enhance agricultural productivity. This review also illustrates the application of CD based sensors for agricultural monitoring which aids in checking agrochemical overuse in the soil and environment beyond the permissible levels.

1. Introduction
Carbon quantum dots, often called CDs, are a novel member of the carbon nanomaterial (CNM) family having a quasi-spherical structure with a size <10 nm.1,2 Ever since their discovery, they have been explored for their unique properties such as tunable PL, remarkable photo-stability, biocompatibility, chemical inertness, and easy surface functionalization.3,4 In a report by Miura et al. in 1997, CDs of 40 nm size were prepared through the electron-beam-induced deposition method and used for making an electronic device.5 Successively, in the year 2002, QDs of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)6 and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)7 were reported. Similarly, Cleri et al. in 2004 obtained carbon dots with an ultra-small size of 1 nm by simulated-beam irradiation welding and used them for the fabrication of an electronic circuit.8 Similar to other QDs, CDs have a small size and display strong PL, but in contrast possess water solubility, negligible toxicity, and considerable biocompatibility.9–11 These noteworthy properties offer them wide-ranging applications in the fields of biomedicine,12–14 sensing,15–17 biosensing,18,19 antimicrobial agents,20–22 security,23–25 photocatalysis,26–28 optoelectronic devices29,30 and recently in agriculture.31,32
Goal 2 of the ‘2030 agenda for sustainable development’ has addressed the importance of sustainable food production for human well-being.33 The sustainable management of the agro-ecosystem is also essential for ensuring the food and nutrition security of the present and future generations.34 The United Nations projected that the global population will rise to 9.7 and 11.0 billion by the years 2050 and 2100, respectively.35 A study on the future of global food production reveals that global agricultural production is estimated to increase by 70% in 2050.36 However, the global food demand may increase up to 110% over the same period.37 To achieve this goal, food production must increase in a way that meets the needs of the growing population, combats malnutrition, and does not require expanding agricultural land.38 Therefore, the point of convergence of agricultural and allied researchers is more inclined towards the enhancement of global food production that must fulfill the future demand of the growing population.
However, the prevailing issues faced the by agriculture sectors such as rapid climate changes, a decrease in soil fertility, macro and micronutrient deficiency, lack of water holding capacity of the soil, an unbalanced irrigation system, the ubiquitous use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides, and heavy metal contamination in the soil are some of the hurdles to overcome to achieve the above goal.39,40 These aforementioned challenges reduce crop production which could adversely affect global food production in near future. Addressing these challenges, nanotechnology has immensely contributed to sustainable agriculture by enhancing crop production and restoring and improving soil quality. Nanotechnology is applied in various aspects of agriculture including nano-fertilizers, transport of genetic materials for crop improvement, delivery and controlled release of nano-pesticide, release of biotic and abiotic stresses, and application of nanosensors for rapid detection of phytopathogens, micronutrients, and food contaminants.41–43 The nanomaterials commonly used in agriculture include carbonaceous, polymeric, metal, and metal oxide nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, nano alumino-silicates, and luminescent nanomaterials including semiconductor-type QDs, metal nanoclusters (MNCs), and organic–inorganic composites.42,44–46 For the use of nanomaterials in agriculture, safety parameters such as biocompatibility and eco-toxicity are evaluated to ensure bio-safety. Compared to other nanomaterials, CNMs exhibit negligible environmental toxicity and remarkable biocompatibility due to their carbon skeleton. However, the toxicity of CNMs depends on their size, shape, surface functionalities, and other physicochemical features.47–49 The commonly used CNMs for the plant growth enhancer are CDs, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) i.e., SWCNTs, MWCNTs, and graphene oxide (GO).50,51 Qu et al. first revealed that CDs are biocompatible with plants while working with bean sprouts.52 This study triggered further research to explore the potential effects of CDs on plant growth and crop yield enhancement. In order to achieve sustainable agricultural production, environmental safety must be maintained. The non-toxicity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility of CDs present a sustainable approach towards increasing crop production. Moreover, the chemical inertness of CDs ensures their stability and long shelf-life. The easy availability of precursors and ease of synthesis smoothen their cost-effective large-scale preparation. Hitherto, CDs have shown a remarkable increase in plant growth and crop production. Additionally, they have been used as photosynthesis enhancers, seed priming agents, biotic and abiotic stress alleviators, antimicrobial agents, and enhancers of biological nitrogen fixation in plant systems.53,54 CDs have immense potential to be applied for increasing food production in a sustainable manner, but the large-scale application of CDs in the field of agriculture is yet to be realized.1,55–57
Till now, various reviews have been published on nanotechnological advancements in plant systems. Reviews by Zhang et al. and Hu et al. describe the various dimensions of nano-systems including the impact of nanotechnology on plant growth. They have discussed the various aspects of carbonaceous, metal, and metal oxide nanoparticles for the plant system. Additionally, the numerous sensors for the detection of pesticides and herbicides are also listed in this review.58,59 In another context, the positive and negative impacts of CNMs in plant systems have been described by Mukherjee et al.60 Zhu et al. deliberated on the effect of CNMs as a photo-synthetic enhancer, delivering tools for agrochemicals and efficient sensors to detect pesticides.61 Yin et al., Singh et al. and Rajput et al. mentioned the affirmative advancement of nano-enabled products in sustainable agriculture along with future opportunities and challenges.62–64 Very recently, Guo et al. addressed the effect of CDs on the pre-harvest and post-harvest life cycles of the plant. Furthermore, they also summarize the efficiency of CDs as nano-fertilizers, photosynthesis enhancers, and biomolecule delivery agents i.e., deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA).32
Recently, Li et al. presented the impact of CDs as photosynthetic enhancers, their uptake in plants, their growth effect, disease resistance property, nitrogen fixation, and nutrient assimilation effect in plants, their biotic and abiotic resistance, and their antimicrobial property in the agricultural system.53 However, CDs hold more potential in plant disease management, which is discussed in detail in the present review. All these reviews have provided an overview of the consequences of different nanomaterials in plants. Extending this work, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on the application of CDs in sustainable agriculture. The review highlights recent developments and perspectives on the use of CDs in agriculture, including CD-based agricultural sensors for monitoring of hazardous chemicals. This review systematically deliberates the synthesis, structure, and properties of CDs. Furthermore, their potential applications in agriculture to enhance plant photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and improve seed germination for sustainably increasing crop yields are discussed in detail. The progressive effects of CDs on the release of biotic and abiotic stress on the plant are also discussed which intends to stimulate further research in this area. Finally, CD-based numerous sensors to detect pesticides and herbicides in plants are also listed.
2. Carbon dots
2.1. Green synthesis of carbon dots
Several facile synthetic methodologies have been developed in the past few years, for the preparation of CDs with varied functionalities and photophysical properties. Synthesis routes for CDs are broadly classified into (i) bottom-up and (ii) top-down approaches. Different synthesis routes offer opportunities for tuning the properties of CDs by tuning the size and surface morphology.65,66 In the top-down approach, CDs are synthesized from large graphitic materials by laser ablation, electrochemical oxidation, and arc discharge method. However, they call for harsh reaction conditions, time taking procedures, and expensive materials.66,67 In the bottom-up approach, CDs are synthesized from small molecules by hydrothermal/solvothermal, microwave irradiation, and pyrolysis methods. The bottom-up approach is eco-friendly and cost-effective, thus more suitable for the production of CDs.68,69 Different synthetic routes of CD preparation are displayed in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Different synthesis routes of CDs and plant-based synthesis and its advantages. 
The synthesis of CDs has been achieved with varied methodologies and myriads of carbon precursors. However, green synthesis is more economic, faster, much more approachable, and convenient.70 CDs, regardless of the synthesis methodology, show good biocompatibility and can be efficiently applied in agriculture. The greenness of the synthesis method further enhances biocompatibility and decreases environmental risk.71 The green synthesis achieved by utilization of plant extracts consisting of various bioactive molecules such as alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, organic acids (ascorbic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, etc.), polyphenols, carbohydrates, etc., results in the formation of potent CDs because of the speed of the reaction, which depends upon these phytochemicals.72–75 Being rich sources of carbon and other heteroatoms (O, N, S, Si, P, etc.), these phytochemicals facilitate self-passivation and self-doping. Moreover, the abundant hydrophilic functional groups of phytochemicals impart excellent water solubility.75 The utilization of biomass waste including agricultural, forestry, food waste, etc. offers two-fold advantages: economic and environmental.76 However, the large-scale production of high-quality CDs with plant-based green methods is still a challenge.77 This review mainly focuses on plant-based bottom-up synthesis approaches for CD synthesis as discussed ahead (Fig. 1).65,66,69
In the bottom-up approach, the hydrothermal method is the most fascinating and it is achieved by heating an aqueous/organic solution of the desired carbon source in inert or air atmosphere under high pressure and temperature. This method offers a self-passivated one-step synthesis process, easy heteroatom doping, cost-efficiency, non-toxicity, and highly efficient synthesis.67,78,79 However, in some cases, time-consuming reactions and low quantum yield (QY) are the main concerns of this method. In the pyrolysis method, the CDs are synthesized by carbonization or pyrolysis of carbon sources at a higher temperature. It encompasses four stages, heating of the precursor, dehydration, decomposition, and ultimately carbonization to synthesize the CDs. This method has several advantages including rapid, easy, and controlled synthesis, economical, solvent-free process, and scalable production of CDs. Additionally, the adjustment of synthesis conditions such as the heating rate, reaction temperature, and duration benefits the synthesis of desired CDs.67,77,78,80–82 In Table S1,† the CDs are synthesized via a bottom-up approach using carbon precursors such as plant extract, fruit pulp, peel, and agricultural waste are listed. We also compared the advantages and disadvantages of this approach to top-down and on this basis, we elucidate the advantages of green CDs over other methods and carbon sources (Table S2†).
In a report, Tyagi et al. synthesized blue fluorescent CDs with excellent water solubility due to abundant hydrophilic surface groups. Herein, the CDs were found to be efficient for the fabrication of turn on–off sensors for sensitive detection of Cr6+ in a water sample as low as 73 nM.83 Similarly, Amin et al. employed fluorescent nitrogen doped CDs (N-CDs) to design an on–off sensor for the detection of zoledronic acid owing to Fe3+ interaction with hydrophilic groups of CDs and competitive interaction of zoledronic acid and Fe3+.81 The nitrogen doping in near infrared CDs (N-doped NIR-CDs) synthesized by Ding et al. was found to control the size, QY, and PL properties. Herein, increasing the nitrogen content resulted in excitation-independent PL emission at 704 nm. These N-CDs with high penetrating power and low cytotoxicity were used in bio-imaging.84 Moringa root-derived N-CDs modified with citric acid and gallic acid could act as antifungal agents, growth enhancers of sorghum seedlings, and sensors for detecting herbicide sulcotrione (limit of detection = 2 μg mL−1).85 Similarly, the CDs obtained from seaweed exhibited anti-fungal activity against Pseudoperonospora cubensis pathogen responsible for cucumber downy mildew. These CDs were also explored as flumorph (fungicide) carriers.86 In another study, CDs produced from hydrothermal carbonization of Calotropis procera leaves reported an excitation-dependent fluorescence with high QY for detecting pesticide isoprothiolane in fruit and rice samples.87
Microwave-assisted synthesis is another methodology, which involves electromagnetic radiation producing homogeneous temperature and rapid action on the carbon precursor to transform into CDs.68,88,89 A facile synthesis of blue fluorescence CDs synthesized by Malavika et al. using Aloe barbadensis M. has shown potential in photocatalysis applications.90 A comparative study between hydrothermal and microwave synthesis of N-CDs using Ginkgo fruit was conducted by Li et al. The N-CDs via., microwave synthesis had a smaller size (average 2.82 nm). However, hydrothermally synthesized N-CDs showed a bigger size (average 3.81 nm) and better fluorescence emission owing to more regular and uniform morphology. This suggested that although microwave synthesis is faster, the hydrothermal procedure has better morphological control.91 Green synthesis of CDs from various plant precursors using bottom-up approaches is listed in Table S1.†
2.2. Structure of carbon dots
CDs are quasi-spherical, amorphous, or semi-crystalline, zero-dimensional (0D) CNMs with a size <10 nm. They have a core–shell-like structure consisting of an sp2 hybridized graphitic carbon core surrounded by sp3 hybridized carbon defects as a matrix or shell formed by the process of slow nucleation.92 This matrix contains an array of functional groups such as hydroxyl (–OH), epoxy/ether (–O–), carbonyl (–CO–), and carboxylic acid (–COOH).2,93 These hydrophilic groups impart water-soluble nature to CDs. Researchers believe that the presence of shell structure enhances biocompatibility.94
2.3. Properties of carbon dots
CDs possess unique physical and chemical properties such as fluorescence, phosphorescence, tunable PL, photo-induced electron transferability, water solubility, biocompatibility, photostability, and chemical inertness. These properties are due to the quantum confinement effect, edge defects, surface state, tunable band gap, and multi-emissive center. However, these properties can be tuned by the use of different carbon precursors, reaction conditions, synthesis methods, nature of the solvent, and pH of the solution to achieve the CDs for the desired application. The properties of CDs such as absorption, PL, and phosphorescence are discussed in this section.95

2.3.1. Absorption properties of carbon dots. 
CDs exhibit broad optical absorption maxima in the ultraviolet (UV) region (100–400 nm), which gradually shifted to the visible range. The absorption peaks that appear at ∼240 nm are attributed to the π–π* electronic transition of CC bonds. However, the peak ∼340 nm is due to the n–π* transition from the CO groups present at the surface. Furthermore, the absorption peak can be redshifted by increasing the size of CDs, hetero-atom doping, or by reduction of CDs. Additionally, multi-optical emission in the visible region is also observed in doped-CDs due to the multiple absorption centers.96–98


2.3.2. Photoluminescence of carbon dots. 
The significant optical property of CDs is PL, which offers them various applications.99,100 The origin of PL of CDs is the core, molecular, and surface states. The core emission is attributed to the emission due to sp2 hybridized carbon atoms and π-conjugated domains of the core or by the quantum confinement effect. The molecular emission originates due to covalently bonded or non-bonded chromophores. However, surface emission arises from functional groups present on the surface of CDs.101,102 The surface state emission accounts for the solvatochromic effect, pH sensitivity, and oxidation effect. The PL maximum for CDs mainly appears in the blue and green regions of the spectra.103 This feature could significantly enhance photosynthesis because CDs absorb and emit photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) efficiently. Additionally, CDs are stable to photobleaching showing stable PL under long-time exposure to radiation which positively affects plant growth.57 Interestingly, the PL of CDs can be tuned by surface passivation and doping with heteroatoms. Doping with heteroatoms can create multi emission centers which tune the PL spectra from blue to red. Moreover, heteroatom doping also enhances the QY and PL intensity.104,105 The QY value is a measure of the brightness of PL, which is considerably affected by precursors, synthesis methods, and post-passivation.106
Ding et al. attributed the wavelength dependence of PL to the degree of oxidation on the surface. The red-shift (440 to 625 nm) in emission spectra was relative to the degree of oxidation of surface states due to gradual reduction in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) – lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) band gaps with the increasing incorporation of oxygen species into their surface.107 The CDs generally manifest excitation wavelength-dependent photoluminescence.100,108 CDs synthesized from biomass precursors usually exhibit excitation-dependent PL, indicative of the presence of various particle sizes.109–112 Upon surface passivation, the CDs show enhanced PL owing to the quantum confinement effect of the surface traps on the CD surface.110 Li et al. engineered the surface of the CDs by amine modification. Amine-rich CDs exhibited excitation-independent and enhanced PL which shows the effect of the degree of functionalization. The reason attributed is the higher degree of surface functionalization, which removes non-radiative recombination by removing the other functional group.113 Apart from this, CDs also exhibit up-conversion (UC) photoluminescence due to the multiphoton active process. Up-conversion PL is considered effective due to its higher efficiency and its in-depth penetration to deep tissue without tissue damage.114 Furthermore, the up-conversion of CDs can augment the light coverage of photosynthetic pigments i.e., they can convert NIR radiation to visible light, which is easily absorbed by plants. Composites of up-conversion nanomaterials (NaYF4:Yb,Er, and NaYF4:Yb,Tm) with CDs are also reported to enhance photosynthetic rates in plants such as mung bean and Arabidopsis thaliana.115,116


2.3.3. Phosphorescence of carbon dots. 
Phosphorescence is the emission of light of a longer wavelength from a triplet excited state to a singlet ground state during which the electron has the same spin orientation as that of the ground state. It was noticeable that the CDs exhibit phosphorescence due to unique structural arrangements as the spin–orbit coupling in the singlet–triplet state is due to the presence of CO and CN functional groups.117,118 Furthermore, polymeric materials also influence the phosphorescence of CDs. When CDs are dispersed into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and irradiated by UV light, Deng et al. detected phosphorescence at room temperature.119 Tian et al. reported that the room temperature (RT) emission intensity increased with increasing annealing temperature, which is due to the dehydration of the CDs/PVA composite at high temperatures. This resulted in creation of chemical bonds between internal functional groups, eliminating the vibration and rotation in the system thereby enhancing their emission.120


2.3.4. Biocompatibility and toxicity of carbon dots. 
The biological efficacy of CDs is due to their low cytotoxicity and remarkable biocompatibility. The minimal cytotoxicity of CDs has been confirmed by several cytotoxicity assays using diverse cell lines.68,121,122 Cytotoxicity of CDs is mainly dependent on the cell lines, properties of CDs, and incubation conditions including their concentration.123 Janus et al. evaluated chitosan-derived N-CDs for their cytotoxicity using human dermal fibroblasts for 48 h and reported 94% cell viability.124 Shao et al.'s cytotoxicity investigation on human normal hepatic stellate cell line LX-2 cells and human HCC cell line HepG2 cells of CDs revealed that CDs are almost non-cytotoxic.125 In an assay conducted by Liu et al., wheat straw-derived CDs were found to be of low toxicity to HeLa cells.126 A remarkable cell viability of 91.7% was reported by Marouzi et al. when CDs derived from Salvia hispanica L. were tested on the HEK293 cell line.127
The first evaluation of the biocompatibility of CDs with plants was done by Qu et al. using bean sprouts grown in the aqueous solution of CDs (1.5 mg mL−1) exhibiting wavelength-dependent fluorescence. The fluorescence of CDs in sprouts marked the translocation of CDs throughout the plant, without being toxic to the plants and thus promoted plant growth.52 Additionally, the degradation of CDs into plant hormone analogs after application to plants and consequent plant growth promotion has been reported in many studies suggesting no generation of toxicity.55,128 When compared with CdTe QDs and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), CDs were found to be the least toxic to green gram sprouts. In this study, the order of toxicity was CdTe QDs ≫ AuNPs > CDs.129 The phytotoxicity of CDs, however, is generally concentration-dependent. A study has shown that CDs have growth-promoting effects at lower doses and toxic effects on plants at higher doses.53 In the case of maize, CD concentrations of 1000–2000 mg L−1 significantly inhibited plant growth owing to oxidative damage, as revealed by reduced fresh weights of roots and shoots.130 Similarly, Chen et al.'s study found that CDs at a concentration of 62.5 mg L−1 had no significant effect on Arabidopsis thaliana, but concentrations of 125–1000 mg L−1 inhibited root and stem growth and concentrations above 1000 mg L−1 inhibited photosynthesis.131 Molecular investigation on Arabidopsis thaliana L. primary root (PR) with the treatment of 40 mg L−1 of N-CDs resulted in the inhibition of auxin synthesis and cell division in primary roots, thereby decreasing PR growth by 54.9%.132 According to a review by Guo et al., the phytotoxicity of CDs is dependent on the precursor used, synthetic methodology, concentration, and species of plant they are applied on.133 However, further proper exploration of the phytotoxicity of CDs is needed. The above-mentioned findings imply that CDs are non-toxic at low concentrations and exhibit biocompatibility.

3. Applications of carbon dots in agriculture
Increasing agricultural productivity is critical to feed the ever-growing human population. The advancements in various agronomic techniques and genetic engineering have been successful in increasing agricultural production.134,135 These have limitations such as being expensive, labor-intensive, time-consuming, and associated risks with genetically modified foods.136 Nanotechnology has revolutionized agriculture, making it more efficient, resilient, and sustainable.137 Small sizes of nanomaterials facilitate diffusion into plant vasculature crossing biological barriers and influencing plant physiology. For years, CNMs have been extensively explored for sustainable agriculture.44 However, owing to their good biocompatibility, eco-friendliness, and cost-effective synthesis, CDs are promising CNMs for application in agriculture.52,135,138,139 A comparison of CDs with other CNMs in agriculture is represented in Table S3.† CDs are believed to show remarkable performance in various physiological processes of plants, including photosynthesis, nutrient assimilation, growth, nitrogen fixation, resistance to plant diseases, and abiotic stress.53 The positive effects of CDs on plant systems suggest their potential in the application of the agricultural system to enhance crop production sustainably.32,140 A representation of diverse modes of CDs in plants and subsequent growth enhancement effects are illustrated in Fig. 2. Besides these CDs also have potential in fabricating sensors for the detection of pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, etc. in agriculture products.

3.1. Carbon dots as a plant growth enhancer
The pioneering study by Tripathi et al. revealed the growth-enhancing effect of water-soluble CDs on root and shoot in wheat under light and dark conditions (Fig. 4A).141 So far, the growth enhancement effect of CDs has been shown in different dicotyledonous and other plants (mung bean, tomato, lettuce, lentils, Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana benthamiana, soybean, eggplant, capsicum, watermelon, radish, celery, coriander, and cabbage) and monocotyledonous plants (wheat, rice, and maize), as summarized in detail in Table 1. However, monocots have an edge over dicots in photosynthetic enhancement. The morphological differences in the vasculature and root structure from dicots and the presence of certain plastid inclusion enhancing photosynthesis are accountable for this.141

CDs exhibit dose-dependent and mode of application-dependent effects on plants. CDs are introduced into the plant system by various modes of application viz., seed pre-treatment, foliar spray, hydroponic solution treatment, and soil treatment. Exposing seeds to an optimized dose of CDs before sowing or germination is termed seed or seedling pre-treatment (i.e., seed priming), which is accepted as a promising strategy as it enhances seed germination efficiency and growth.32,142 Moreover, spraying desired concentration of CDs over foliage (foliar application) is another mode of application of CDs to plants. This technique is simple, inexpensive, fast, and applicable to various crop species. This ensures the direct entry of CDs into the plant system through stomatal openings where two guard cells form a pore of about 3–12 μm wide and 10–30 μm long during the opening for gaseous exchange, thus ensuring better bioavailability.143,144 Researchers have used Hoagland's nutrient solution (hydroponic growth medium) with added desired concentration of CDs to grow plants and to assess the effect of CDs on growth. Another mode of application of CDs to plants is soil treatment which has been recently reported by Swift et al. Herein, glucose-functionalized CDs enhanced the growth of Triticum aestivum ‘Apogee’ (dwarf bread wheat) upon treatment with 50 mg mL−1 of CDs in soil for 7 weeks. This resulted in an 18% increment in crop grain yield.145 Both these techniques involve exposure to roots such that CDs could increase root vigor and nutrient uptake, thus promoting plant growth. In research investigations, for the proper understanding of the effect of CDs on plant development and the underlying mechanism, the evaluation of various growth parameters is involved over a full growth cycle of the plant. This is conducive to the application of CDs in agriculture. This section briefly describes the impact of CDs on seed germination, nutrient uptake, and photosynthesis, the three crucial processes for the growth of plants.

3.1.1. Carbon dots in seed germination and mineral nutrient uptake. 
Seed germination is the first and critical step of plant growth. Ensuring proper seed germination results in better plant development. Several studies have reported positive effects of CDs on seed germination, seedling growth, and nutrient uptake when used as a pretreatment for seeds. The factors that are decisive for increased growth and vigor are the CDs' ability to permeate the hard seed coat (testa and tegmen) and allow water to penetrate. The uptake of CDs inside plants is governed by size, chemical composition, and surface groups. The nano-size of CDs offers enhanced water dispersibility, larger surface area, and better adsorption capacity. In addition to serving as adsorption sites for water and nutrients, the functional groups of CDs activate the production of water channel proteins and reduce the pH of the rhizosphere. This promotes nutrient absorption and improves the rhizosphere microbial environment.144,146
However, the pore size of plant cell walls varies among different species ranging from 1.6–6.2 nm. The dimensions of CDs are smaller than those of the pores in host plants, enabling them to penetrate plant cells and be taken up by the plant system, thereby influencing plant growth, as evidenced by confocal and TEM imaging.144,146 The confocal images of different parts of mung bean after seed pretreatment by CDs concluded that CDs can penetrate seed coat via aqueous solution-filled intercellular spaces of parenchyma cells. This facilitates CD diffusion and further aggregation in cotyledons, thereby accelerating seed germination.147
Plants transport water and nutrients through the symplastic and apoplastic pathways.148 Nevertheless, the transportation of CDs can take place by a symplastic pathway in addition to the apoplastic pathway.131,134 Studies on the absorption and transportation of CDs have revealed that they can penetrate plant cells and then transport them from the root to stems and leaves along with water and minerals.132,149 The smaller size of CDs enables their smoother translocation and penetration into the cell,150 where plants absorb CDs via the apoplastic pathway, through cell walls and plasmodesmata and subsequently, cross the cortex and enter the xylem through the symplastic pathway, via extracellular spaces. Depending upon the transpiration and diffusion coefficient, the CDs follow different pathways in different agro-ecological regions in plants.137 Laser microscopic confocal imaging confirmed that CDs were transferred from the roots to the stems and leaves by the vascular system through the apoplastic pathway and later on accumulate in different regions in plants.132,149
Water is one of the most crucial inputs for plant physiology and is directly involved in seed germination and the uptake of ions in the root. Wang et al. reported a dose-controlled effect of seed pre-treatment by CDs on the growth of mung bean sprouts, including root elongation, increase in root number, stem elongation, and biomass. CDs at a concentration of 0.02 mg mL−1 promoted root vigor up to 36.1%. This leads to increased water absorption and faster plant growth, as evidenced by the rise in seed moisture level (54.5%), promoting plant growth and development.149 In their subsequent study, the pretreatment of mung bean seeds with chiral CDs at a concentration of 100 μg mL−1 improved the seed's water absorption capacity, regardless of the CDs' chirality. However, the increase in root vigor was greater with dextrorotatory CDs (D-CDs) at 28.9% compared to levorotatory CDs (L-CDs) at 8.4%. This was attributed to the increased activity of the succinodehydrogenase enzyme by D-CDs in comparison to L-CDs, resulting in an increase in carbohydrate content. Herein chiral CDs accelerated seed germination and elongation of the root and hypocotyl region (Fig. 3A and B).151 The priming of mung bean seeds for 6 days with a concentration of 0.15 mg mL−1 of N-CDs derived from magnolia leaves resulted in an increase in sprout diameter by 12.07%, which is an indication of enhanced water uptake due to CDs and water association.152 The accelerated seed germination and seedling growth of lettuce, tomato, and Chinese flowering cabbage observed in response to increasing concentrations of CDs (0.033, 0.066, and 0.132 mg mL−1) were attributed to increased moisture uptake during the imbibition stage (Fig. 3C).153 The seed germination, root development, seed moisture level, and seedling length are linked to the oxygen content of CDs represented by hydrophilic surface groups (–OH and –COOH) on CDs. The –OH and –COOH groups on the surface of CDs bind with water molecules and facilitate the entry of water into plants. Li et al. observed that adequate moisture in the paddy seeds can speed up germination and the growth of seedlings. Herein, 0.56 mg mL−1 of CDs effectively promoted rice-plant growth when the oxygen content of CDs was about 29%.56 Their subsequent study on dicot plants provided a similar reason for increased water uptake and root length. CDs with a high degree of oxygen-containing groups showed an enhanced effect on root length.154 CDs have been found to promote better seed germination than the commercial N-fertilizer, with urea as a seed priming agent. Wang et al. presented a study that compared the fertilization effect of N-CDs at different concentrations (e.g., 0, 0.2, or 4.0 mg mL−1) and urea. They demonstrated that seed pretreatment with 0.2 mg mL−1 N-CDs for 72 hours resulted in a 200% increase in the average lengths of shoots and roots, and a 17.46% increase in wet weight compared to urea. They also suggested the advantages of N-CDs over conventional fertilizers such as easy uptake due to small size and water solubility, stable PL-enabled plant growth monitoring, high nitrogen content for plants, biocompatibility, and economical production of CD-based nano-fertilizers (Fig. 3D).155 A recent study on seed pretreatment of lentil seeds with varying concentrations of Spirulina-derived N-CDs resulted in a concentration-dependent seedling growth enhancement. 0.1 mg mL−1 N-CDs led to an increase in root length by 48%, seedling length by 105%, and biomass by 120% (Fig. 3E).156

In addition to promoting water uptake, CDs also facilitate the absorption of mineral nutrients in plants. The interaction between the hydrophilic (–OH and –COOH) groups attached to the surface of CDs and nutrients takes place via hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. This is accountable for the sustained and slow release of nutrients within the xylem.157 A study by Kou et al. on lettuce and tomatoes reported a significant increase in the contents of N, K, Ca, Mg, and Mn following treatment with CDs, which was consistent with the results of the chlorophyll content and supported the above-mentioned reasoning. The expression of genes related to aquaporins (membrane proteins for the transport of water, nutrients, and gases) was also upregulated by CDs. This resulted in increased water and mineral ion absorption and significant activation of photosynthesis and growth.153,158 Hu et al. in their study on coriander plant reported that CDs at 40 mg L−1 increased the contents of K, Ca, Mg, P, Mn, and Fe by 64.3 21.0, 26.2, 12.8, 56.0 and 125%, respectively, as compared to the control.159 An et al. reported increments in the N, P, and K contents by 4.4, 10.8, and 16.5%, respectively, in the lettuce plant treated with 0.02 mg mL−1. This indicated the enhanced uptake of chemical fertilizers from nutrient medium or soil.160 These studies indicate that seed priming with CDs can efficiently accelerate seed germination, enhance nutrient and water uptake and thereby improve seedling growth.


3.1.2. Carbon dots as photosynthetic enhancers. 
Photosynthesis is a process that converts solar energy to chemical energy in plants or photosynthetic organisms. This process encompasses two reactions: the light reaction and the dark reaction, conducted in the chloroplast. In the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts, light-harvesting pigments such as chlorophyll, xanthophyll, and carotenes work as antennae for capturing light energy. Through a series of electron transfer chains, the absorbed light is passed on to photosystem-I (PS-I) and photosystem-II (PS-II), which consist of protein complexes. The light reaction eventually generates oxygen by splitting water and energy-carrying molecules adenosine trinucleotide phosphate (ATP) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The ATP and NADPH so produced enter the dark reaction taking place in the stroma of chloroplasts, where they are involved in CO2 assimilation to carbohydrates. Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCO) is the key enzyme of the Calvin cycle that plays a critical role in carbon assimilation in the dark reaction of photosynthesis and thus, its activity directly influences the photosynthetic rate.50,161,162,163 Photosynthesis is accountable for more than 90% of crop biomass production.164 Therefore, crop growth and ultimately its yields are dependent on efficient photosynthesis.165 However, plants have evolved to have much lower photosynthetic capacity than the theoretical maximum.166 Out of total solar radiation, only 45% of it constitutes photosynthetically active radiation (400 to 700 nm), of which only 1–2% can be absorbed by the photosynthetic pigments of the plants.167 Along with the narrow absorption spectrum of photosynthetic pigments, photoinhibition under high-intensity light limits the enhancement of photosynthesis.168,169
Some of the previous endeavors to improve plant photosynthetic efficiency include environmental modeling, gene regulation, and genetic improvements.170,171 Plant nano-bionics, however, has been found efficient in improving the photosynthetic efficiency of plants in both ways, in vitro and in planta.172 CDs are efficient electron donors and acceptors and can accelerate the photosynthetic process by transferring electrons to chloroplasts and subsequently to light-harvesting complexes. Additionally, the PL of CDs can convert light or transfer energy to chloroplasts, thereby improving their photosynthetic activity. Furthermore, CDs can also contribute to plants' chlorophyll synthesis and CO2 assimilation.157,161,173 Previously, researchers have conjugated CDs into isolated chloroplasts and observed that the electron transport rates (ETR) were increased along with the enhancement of photosynthetic activity. CDs can be considered artificial antennae that facilitate chloroplasts to capture light wavelengths across a wide range, starting from UV to NIR. These studies demonstrated that CDs have great potential in agriculture to improve crop growth.32,161 Chandra et al. constructed a nanohybrid system consisting of CDs adsorbed on the chloroplast surface, which accelerated the entire electron transfer pathway towards the chloroplasts and eventually enhanced photosynthesis.55 To understand the role of CDs in photosynthesis, several significant factors such as ETR, photosystem activity, chlorophyll content, RuBisCO activity, etc., were used as parameters for the evaluation of photosynthetic enhancement.
Li et al. demonstrated that internalized CDs could absorb UV radiation and convert it into the PAR region, which is captured by chlorophyll, resulting in increased ETR, thus augmenting photosynthesis.173 Li et al. prepared CDs that show strong absorption in the UV region and emit intense blue and red light, correlating with the absorption spectrum of the chloroplast. The production of ATP was increased by 2.8-fold by the hybrid photosystem produced upon conjugation of CDs on the extracted chloroplast surface in vitro.57 A similar in vitro investigation on far-red CDs coated on chloroplast showed conversion of (UV-A) light to 625–800 nm far-red emission, directly absorbed and utilized by chloroplasts. The electron transfer efficiency between PS-II and PS-I was thereby increased, resulting in an increase in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production.174
NIR light constitutes 52% of the solar spectrum, not fully utilized by plants.172 NaYF4:Yb,Er is an efficient up-conversion nanomaterial and possesses the ability to transform NIR light to visible light (primarily green and red spectrum) through multiple-photon absorption. When combined with CDs, these up-conversion nanomaterials exhibit a synergistic effect by enhancing up-conversion emission. In mung bean plants, these NaYF4:Yb,Er@CD nanocomposites were found to effectively convert light and enhance photosynthetic activity.116 Another material called an aggregation-induced emission-based fluorescent material (AIEgen) in combination with CDs has been reported to exhibit photosynthetic enhancement. AIEgens are molecules that are hardly emissive in a molecularly dissolved state, but become strongly emissive upon aggregation owing to the restricted intermolecular motion. Xiao et al. engineered a hybrid photosynthetic system, consisting of chloroplast and aggregation-induced emission CD (CD-AIEgens) made from natural quercetin. CD-AIEgens accelerated the ETR in PS-II and improved the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts by intense absorption of UV light and AIE active emission.175 The positive effects of CDs on photosynthesis and associated plant growth have attracted the attention of researchers worldwide.
Besides light reactions, CDs also accelerate the dark reaction of photosynthesis. Carbon assimilation is equally crucial for plant growth. CDs have been reported to increase RuBisCO enzyme activity. Li et al. used Arabidopsis thaliana and Trifolium repens L. as modal plants. Additionally, 8 dicot plants were treated with different concentrations of CDs in a hydroponic solution. All the plants under study have shown improved growth characteristics such as increased RuBisCO enzyme activity by 30.9%, increased carbohydrate content, and a yield of up to 20% in these 8 cultivated dicot plants. Moreover, CDs on interaction with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which are widely distributed in the plants are degraded to produce CO2 and plant hormone analogs. The produced CO2 enters a dark reaction and is converted to carbohydrates, while the hormone analogs promote plant growth.154 Li et al., in their study on CD seed pre-treatment on rice seedlings, evidenced the above-mentioned fact by an in vitro experiment of CDs with HRP and then analyzing the degradation products.56 Agnol et al. proposed a possible mechanism involving the negatively charged oxygen groups on the CD surface in solution (evidenced by the negative zeta potential value). Herein particles orient themselves towards the positively charged arginine residue (Arg178), near the site of HRP, followed by the oxidation of –OH and –COOH groups by HRP.156
CDs have differentiated effects on C3 (rice) and C4 (corn) plants. A comparative evaluation of the effect of foliar spray of CDs on C3 and C4 plants was conducted by Tan et al.; rice utilizes the C3 pathway to fix carbon through the Calvin cycle.178 ATP and NADPH formed during the light reactions are utilized to reduce CO2 to triose phosphate in the reaction of the C3 cycle.176 The higher rate of CO2 assimilation in rice plants (56%) compared to corn (16%) was attributed to corn being a C4 plant that possesses intrinsic pathways for reducing photorespiration and increasing rates of CO2 fixation. The higher efficiency of the C4 pathway for CO2 fixation is ascribed to the physical separation of the light reaction (mesophyll cells) and Calvin cycle (bundle sheath cells). Moreover, the C4 pathway ensures that the Calvin cycle enzyme RuBisCO has a higher concentration of CO2 around, and the oxygenase activity is suppressed.177 An increase in CO2 assimilation resulted in higher electron transport rates as CDs promote light assimilation and boost electron transfer efficiencies in PS-I and PS-II. The above observation was supported by stomatal conductance measurement which is a measure of the degree of stomatal opening involved in the regulation of the photosynthesis and transpiration process of plants. Greater stomatal conductance indicates higher CO2 intake from stomata, resulting in better CO2 availability and assimilation. CDs promote the stomatal conductance in rice with an improvement of 56% as compared to the control which indicates that CDs enhanced the gas exchange capacity and the overall productivity of the plants.178,179
Apart from this, the photosynthetic enhancement effect also depends on the mode of application of CDs. A comparative study by Milenković et al. on the effect of the mode of application on the photosynthetic enhancement of crop yield found that the foliar application of CDs is more effective than adding them to the growth solution. They found that a solution treatment with 10 mg mL−1 CDs had a similar effect on photosynthetic parameters to a low 1.0 mg mL−1 treatment through foliar application (Table 1).180 Similarly, foliar spray of 3900 mg mL−1 PVA-coated CDs significantly increased the photosynthesis rate, crop yield, soluble sugar, and protein content of lettuce. This study highlighted the advantages of foliar spray of PVA-coated CD nanocapsules. They used a water in oil-in-water (W/O/W) double-emulsion to encapsulate CDs for improved bioavailability on the leaf surface in contrast to easy drying and drain-off of the aqueous solution of CDs. The effect of different concentrations of such CDs is shown in Fig. 4B.181 Similarly, Huang et al. foliar sprayed the CDs on Italian lettuce plant. They revealed that the fresh weight of the lettuce was effectively enhanced up to 25.53%, 33.25%, and 39.50% using citric acid-CDs (CA-CDs), ethylenediamine-CDs (EDA-CDs), and Mg-, and N-CDs, respectively, over the control treatment. They also improve the nutrient qualities of lettuce.182 Li et al. reported that the foliar spray of 300 μg mL−1 CDs on rice seedlings significantly enhanced the ETR by 29.81%, the photosynthetic efficiency of PS-II by 29.88%, the chlorophyll content by 64.53%, the RuBisCO activity by 23.29%, the shoot dry weight by 64.31% and the root dry weight by 61.79%. They also emphasized the effect of QY of CDs on photosynthesis as direct energy transfer can potentially damage thylakoids. Herein, CDs with a moderate QY of 46.42% enhanced the photosynthetic efficiency of rice seedlings.173

Doping the CDs with various elements such as N, Mg, etc. also positively impacts the photosynthetic efficiency by causing a red-shift in their PL resulting in augmentation of photosynthetic coverage. For example, Li et al. prepared Mg- and N-doped CDs for plant photosynthesis, using carbonate for Mg2+ doping and graphitic-N form for N doping. This doping resulted in a red-shift of the PL. The rice plants were sprayed with Mg-, N-CDs at 50, 100, and 300 μg mL−1 at intervals of every two days for 16 days. At a concentration of 300 μg mL−1, growth enhancement was observed in terms of the height of rice seedlings (22.34%), fresh biomass (70.60%), chlorophyll a (14.39%), chlorophyll b (26.54%) contents, RuBisCO activity (46.62%), ETR (104.48%), PS activity (109.54%) and photosynthetic efficiency (127.16%). Additionally, the gene expression of chlorophyll metabolism-related enzymes in rice seedlings was measured, including the Mg-dechelatase subunit (ChlI and ChlD), chlorophyll synthase (ChlG), and chlorophyllase-2. At a concentration of 300 μg mL−1, Mg-, N-CDs remarkably increased the expressions of ChlI, ChlD, ChlG, and chlorophyllase-2 genes of rice seedlings by 93.55, 15.26, 115.02, and 29.75%, respectively.183 Similarly, foliar spray of N-CDs at a concentration of 5.0 mg L−1 on corn was found to increase the net photosynthesis rate (21.51%), carbohydrate content (66.43% in roots and 42.03% in shoots), fresh weight (24.03% in roots and 34.56% in shoots), and dry weight (72.30% in roots and 55.75% in shoots) as compared to un-doped CDs. N-Doping improved the light conversion efficiency of CDs, providing electrons to accelerate the light and splitting of water in PS-II. Along with other photosynthetic parameters, a 44.8% enhancement in the photosynthetic rate and improvement of the gene expression of the sucrose transporter (SUT) by 1.61-fold enhanced the growth of corn. The increase in SUT expression enhanced the sucrose transport capacity in the phloem, and therefore more carbohydrate was transported from leaves to fruits. They also promoted the foliar application of CDs in a controlled manner in agriculture.184
Wang et al. found that the foliar spray of CDs with UV absorption and NIR emission can strengthen photosynthesis by overexpressing PsbP and PsiK genes, promoting photosynthetic electron transfer and activating PS-II and PS-I in Nicotiana benthamiana besides enhancing other photosynthetic parameters. PsbP genes and PsiK genes are photosynthesis and chloroplast synthesis-related genes. In the study, the expression levels of the PsiK gene were dramatically increased by 32-fold as compared to the control. The expression levels of the PsbP gene were increased the most by 48-fold as compared to the control (Fig. 4C).185 Similarly, the NaYF4:Yb,Er@CDs nanocomposite on mung bean seedlings can improve photosynthesis and promote their growth due to the effect of light conversion. The foliar spray of 0.5 mg mL−1 of NaYF4:Yb,Er@CDs nanocomposite on mung bean seedlings enhanced the electron transfer rate of PS-II, photosynthetic efficiency, transpiration rate by 44% and stomatal conductance by 48.57% relative to the control. Phenotypically the enhanced growth was represented by increased leaf area, longest root/stem length, and high fresh/dry weight.116 A foliar spray of 10 mg L−1 of N-CDs for 60 days on tomato enhanced the net photosynthetic rate (168.31%) and fresh shoot biomass (55.86%) along with improved disease resistance as discussed below.186 However, 5 mg L−1 of CDs on maize seedlings enhanced the growth along with improved drought tolerance, evident by the increase in net photosynthesis rate by 122.9%, carbohydrate content by 35.4% in shoots, and 113.6% in roots, fresh weight of shoots and roots by 62.1 and 50.6%, and dry weight of shoots and roots by 29.2 and 37.5%, respectively as detailed below.187
The far-red emissive CDs are believed to be beneficial for photosynthetic enhancement as far-red light is easily absorbed by plants. For instance, an in vivo study on far-red CDs in hydroponic solution at varying concentrations (0, 1, 3, 5, 7 μg mL−1) was conducted to assess the growth of Rome lettuce for 7 days. They revealed that the hybrid photosynthetic system at a CD concentration of 5.0 μg mL−1 increased the ATP production, ETR (28.00%), and fresh (51.14%) and dry weights (24.60%) of plants, leading to enhanced plant growth (Fig. 4D).174 Another study found that an optimal concentration of 30 mg L−1 significantly improved the photosynthetic efficiency of lettuce by accelerating the electron transfer and increasing the RuBisCO activity.188 Additionally, a study on Italian lettuce by An et al. revealed that an appropriate concentration of CD solution had growth promotion effects on the plant, indicated by the fresh weight and dry weight of aerial parts (Fig. 4E).189 The above-mentioned growth enhancement effects of CDs on various plants support their large-scale application in agriculture for enhancing crop growth and increasing agricultural yield.

3.2. Carbon dots as stress ameliorators
Plants are susceptible to two types of stresses, namely abiotic and biotic. Abiotic stress is primarily caused by extreme environmental conditions such as drought, salt stress, high temperature, and UV radiation, while biotic stress is caused by phytopathogens. In addition to enhancing plant growth, CDs have also been shown to alleviate both biotic and abiotic stress on plants and improve crop yield. This will be discussed in further detail in this section.

3.2.1. Carbon dots as abiotic stress ameliorators. 
Abiotic stress refers to any environmental factor that can negatively affect plant growth and productivity. Abiotic stresses such as water stress, high salinity, extreme temperatures, and mineral deficiencies or metal toxicities significantly reduce crop productivity. In response to these conditions, plants have developed defense mechanisms, including the expression of stress-response genes, changes in molecular mechanisms, and production of antioxidant enzymes for reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification.190–193 However, when stress exceeds the plant's defense system, it leads to an increase in the generation of ROS, which can adversely affect plant growth and yield. ROS are O2-derived highly reactive species including radical ions such as superoxide (˙O2−), hydroxyl radical (˙OH), lipid-derived ions, H2O2, and singlet oxygen (1O2).194 According to an estimate, about 1% of O2 consumed by plants is involved to produce ROS in various cell organelles including chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes.195 The role of ROS in the plant body is concentration-dependent. Above the optimal concentration, ROS cause oxidative damage to biomolecules, whereas at relatively low concentrations they act as a second messenger in cell signaling mediating several responses.196
Malonaldehyde (MDA) is a product of lipid peroxidation and an increased level of MDA indicates oxidative damage. Consequently, it is commonly used as a biomarker for oxidative damage.197 Furthermore, it is well documented that proline is a strong antioxidant and an osmotic protector, and its level is high in case of stress.198 Hence, proline content reflects stress resistance to some extent.199 Therefore, chemicals such as MDA and proline are used to measure damage due to stress in plants.200 Additionally, as a response to oxidative damage to the cell, the activity of antioxidant enzymes also shoots up. The majority of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD) are major O2˙− scavengers and their action generate H2O2 and O2. However, peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) can degrade H2O2 to O2 and water, and thus, most of H2O2 is eliminated.201
CDs have been reported to exhibit free radical scavenging activity, attributed to the defects and unpaired electrons on their surface.202 Li et al. in their study on rice demonstrated the effect of heteroatom-free CDs on the alleviation of abiotic stresses for the first time. Herein, salt stress (0.15 M sodium chloride), light stress (2000 LUX), and herbicide stress {2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (5 μg mL−1), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate sodium (30 μg mL−1), glyphosate isopropylamine salt (0.5 μL mL−1) and pendimethalin emulsifiable concentrate (0.5 μL mL−1)} on rice plant were alleviated by CDs through increasing the antioxidant defense system and nutrient assimilation of rice plant Fig. 5A(a and b).203 Moreover, Su et al. studied the effect of CDs on the peanut plant against polyethylene glycol (PEG)-simulated drought stress. In this study, 80 mg L−1 CD concentration has shown the best results. They improve the root activity by 3.5-fold and the root length, seedling height, root number, root dry weight, shoot dry weight, root fresh weight, and shoot fresh weight by 1.5-fold compared to the control (Fig. 5B and C). In addition, the treatment with optimum concentration of CDs leads to enhanced drought resistance ability. The factors responsible for the relieved drought stress are ascribed to the increase in the activity of SOD, CAT, and POD. The increased activities of SOD, POD, and CAT inhibited the production of MDA.204 An investigation by Kou et al. showed that N- and S-CDs enhanced drought resistance in tomatoes and mung beans by boosting the activity of SOD and POD enzymes and upregulating the expression of aquaporin genes for improved water uptake (Fig. 5D).205 Very recently, Chen et al. studied the alleviation effect of CDs on tomato growth under drought stress. They utilized various dosages of CDs (0, 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg) in the kg−1 soil, which improved the soil quality by enhancing organic matter quantities, regulating the pH of the soil, and enzymatic activities. As a result, CDs enhanced the POD and CAT activity while reducing the SOD activity in the plant. They also revealed that 3 mg kg−1 CDs have higher activity for drought resistance. However, 10 to 30 mg CDs in kg−1 soil diminishes the POD and CAT activity and increases the SOD activity. Alteration of these activities increases the H2O2 accumulation in the plant causing oxidative damage.206 In a recent report by Wang et al., the positive effect of CDs on soybean crop growth under drought conditions has been described. They revealed that 5 mg CDs in kg−1 soil significantly improve the nitrogen content and water uptake capacity in soybean by the upregulation of GmNRT, GmAMT, GmLB, and GmAQP genes in the root. Thereby, the N-content increased by 18.5% and 14.8% in soybean shoot and root, respectively. Moreover, it also enhanced the nutrient contents in soybean grains by 3.4, 6.9, and 17.3% for proteins, fatty acids, and amino acids, respectively.207 A similar study by Ji et al. revealed that CDs significantly enhanced the soybean yield by 21.5% and protein content by 3.7% in soybean kernel. In this study, they foliarly applied 5 mg L−1 CDs on soybean; thereby its photosynthesis process and carbohydrate content in the crop were increased. Moreover, CDs also facilitate the N-content in the soil to improve the synthesis of amino acids as well as increase the water uptake capacity. They revealed that the N-content in soybean increased by 13.2% and 30.5% while that of amino acid by 257.5% and 57.5% in shoot and root, respectively. The positive effects of CDs in crop systems supported sustainable agriculture under adverse conditions.208

Wang et al. explored heat stress alleviation by CDs in Italian lettuce, wherein Salvia miltiorrhiza-derived CDs were employed to relieve heat stress. The study revealed that CDs enhanced the antioxidant enzyme activity and osmotic regulation (indicated by the decrease in proline content) and relieved the damage caused due to lipid peroxidation of the plant cell (indicated by the decrease in MDA levels), thereby improving the heat stress resistance (Fig. 6A).209 Moreover, the foliar spray of 5 mL CDs (5 mg L−1) on maize seedlings resulted in increased root exudate attracting plenty of beneficial soil microbes around roots, which in turn increased soil N and P content by 33.5 and 16.8% respectively, and water uptake by 37.2%. The root exudate increased due to increased carbohydrate contents owing to enhanced photosynthesis. This suggests that in addition to increased water uptake, CDs enhanced photosynthesis and increased root exudate which attracts nutrient-replenishing microbes to improve drought tolerance (Fig. 6B and C).187

Heavy metals in soil pose a serious threat to plant growth and health. Xiao et al. in their study on wheat demonstrated the effect of CDs on Cd2+ phytotoxicity. The study revealed that the CDs effectively relieved the stress in wheat by restoring the anthocyanin content, increasing the antioxidant enzyme activity, and inhibiting lipid peroxidation.210 Similarly, Li et al. studied the Cd2+ toxicity alleviation in citrus seedlings through a similar mechanism.211 Dučić et al. investigated the amelioration of copper (Cu) toxicity in maize, where CD treatment reduced Cu concentration in the root, since Cu was possibly trapped between the functional groups on CD surface.212
Soil salinity adversely affects plant growth as it leads to nutrient deficiency, osmotic stress, and ion toxicity. To alleviate salinity stress in grapevine, Gohari et al. used putrescine functionalized CDs (Put-CDs). Putrescine is the polyamine in plants responsible for salt stress and plant growth, which showed synergistic effects along with CDs on the grapevine. 10 mg L−1 of Put-CDs increased leaf weights (fresh and dry), K+ content, photosynthetic pigments, proline, phenolics, and antioxidant enzymatic activities. At the same time, they decrease the Na+, MDA, and H2O2 concentrations.213 Subsequently, the authors used proline functionalized CDs (Pro-CDs) for alleviating salinity stress in grapevines. 100 mg L−1 of Pro-CD priming enhanced the existing proline content of the plant under salinity stress. They also increase the enzymatic and non-enzymatic (phenolics and anthocyanins) antioxidants and decrease MDA and H2O2 which relieved the salinity stress.214
Plants deal with soil salination mainly via Ca2+ signaling and ROS-mediated signaling. A recent investigation on Arabidopsis revealed that the hydroponic application of CDs on sweet potatoes promoted Ca2+ signaling, enhanced nutrient uptake, and improved plants' soil salinity adaptability. Results suggest that the CDs have a Ca2+-mobilizing property, which can alleviate salinity stress by amplifying Ca2+ signaling and ROS scavenging activity.215 Recently, Chen et al. demonstrated that the utilization of 8 and 16 mg kg−1 of functionalized CDs in soil increased the tolerance of tomatoes to soil salinity and alkalinity of such soil. This may be due to the activation of the antioxidant enzyme system, enhancing osmotic regulation, nutrient uptake, and improving photosynthesis.208 The above-mentioned studies support that CDs are potential abiotic stress ameliorators that form the basis of their use in increasing agricultural yield and plant protection.


3.2.2. Carbon dots as biotic stress ameliorators. 
Biotic stress refers to damage induced by deleterious microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, viruses, phytoplasma, viroids, and nematodes, which hinder the sustenance of normal plant growth. This kind of stress is one of the main reasons for the pre- and post-harvest loss, leading to considerable setback to the agriculture sector.190,191,193 Among the different causes of biotic stresses, phytopathogens are of serious concern. Phytopathogens impose a negative effect on agricultural yield, risking food availability and nutritional security.216 The response of plants toward pathogens encounters is characterized by several signaling pathways.217 Biotic stress results in a decreased level of photosynthesis in crops owing to pathogenic infections in leaves, substantially causing a loss of yield. According to a report by Wang et al., biotic stress results in a significant loss of yield in various crops, including wheat, rice, maize, potato, soybean and cotton crops, by nearly 28.2, 37.4, 31.2, 40.3, 26.3, and 28.8%, respectively.218
Researchers have explored the antimicrobial activity of various nanoparticles for plant disease management. However, their eco-toxicity limits their application.219 CDs possess good biocompatibility, water solubility, and minimal toxicity towards eukaryotic cells, making them a favorable option for plant disease management. The antimicrobial activity of CDs was demonstrated by Liu et al. for the first time against Porphyromonas gingivalis, a Gram-negative anaerobic Bacillus, which showed that the CDs have potential efficacy to fight against the microorganism.220
Studies revealed that the surface chemistry of CDs plays a vital role in enhancing their antimicrobial activity, where surface functionalization and heteroatom doping improve the interaction between the CDs and microbial cell wall, thus enabling better adherence of CDs to the cell wall of bacteria for easy internalization of CDs (Fig. 7A).221 Mechanistically, the antimicrobial activity of CDs begins with the electrostatic interaction of positively charged CDs and negatively charged bacterial cell walls, which leads to adherence of CDs on the cell wall followed by internalization. Upon entering the bacterial cell, the CDs generate ROS, causing oxidative damage to biomolecules such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids (DNA/RNA), and so on. The ultimate cell death can be due to lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane followed by leakage of cytoplasmic contents and DNA damage-induced cell death.20,222,223 Wang et al. found that positively charged CDs possess a significant ability to inhibit bacterial growth, due to their strong antibacterial effect via interaction with the negatively charged components of the bacterial cell wall. The study suggests that the regulation of surface charge and synthesis of CDs with a controllable positive charge is crucial.224 Another study found that S- and N-doped CDs have antimicrobial activity on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The activity depends on the specific surface chemistry and size of CDs. N-CDs having positively-charged nitrogen functional groups interact with the negatively charged cell membrane and generate ROS, causing bacterial cell death. However, S-CDs, being negatively charged, inhibit bacterial growth through a size-dependent mechanism rather than surface chemistry.225 Alternatively, their antimicrobial activity can be enhanced by laser irradiation, where laser irradiation accelerates the generation of ROS. Surface charge and laser irradiation show synergistic effects.226

Muktha et al. demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of watermelon peel-derived CDs (W-CDs) and pomegranate peel-derived CDs (P-CDs) against Fusarium oxysporum, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli in comparison with the antifungal activity of fluconazole and antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin.229Fusarium oxysporum and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are phytopathogens, while others are human pathogens. However, Fusarium oxysporum is also known as tomato wilt fungus.227Pseudomonas aeruginosa is present naturally in most agricultural soils and is a possible plant pathogen. They cause plant root disease marked by black necrotic regions at the tips of the roots in Arabidopsis and sweet basil.228 In this study, after 16 h of incubation, the zone of inhibition was measured. 50 μL mL−1 concentration of P-CDs was effective against Fusarium oxysporum, while W-CDs did not have antifungal activity. At a concentration of 80 μL mL−1, P-CDs were effective against Staphylococcus aureus, while W-CDs were effective against Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P-CDs also showed growth inhibition of Escherichia coli at this concentration.229
In another investigation by Li et al., vitamin C-derived CDs were found to possess antibacterial properties against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negative (Bacillus sp. WL-6 and Escherichia coli) bacteria at 100 μg mL−1 CD concentration. Moreover, antifungal properties against two pathogenic fungi, Rhizoctonia solani and Pyricularia grisea, causing rice diseases, (rice sheath blight and blast) were shown at 300 μg mL−1 concentration (Fig. 7B and C). Additionally, these kinds of CDs were found to be completely degraded into CO, CO2, and H2O upon visible light irradiation in the presence of air after 20 days.230 Pandey et al. demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of citric acid and β-alanine derived CDs against diverse groups of Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, and Pectobacterium species. Some of them are clinically relevant pathogens while others are phytopathogens. The bacterial strain used were Escherichia coli DH5α, Pectobacterium carotovorum Ecc7, Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA101, Agrobacterium rhizogenes K599, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium 13311.236Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (formerly Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora) is a phytopathogen responsible for the development of soft rot and stem rot diseases in several crops such as Chinese cabbage, potato, and tomato.231Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil-born bacterium, is responsible for crown gall disease in woody plants such as apples, cherry, walnuts, grapevines, rose, etc., and occasionally in crops such as cotton, sugar beet, tomatoes, beans, and alfalfa.232 However, Agrobacterium rhizogenes is a soil-born Gram-negative bacteria that causes hairy root disease in dicot plants such as soybean, etc.233Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 is accountable for causing bacterial specks in tomatoes.234
The authors ascertained the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of CDs by using the agar-plate well diffusion method. Different concentrations of CDs (0.5, 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mg mL−1) were used in this study to assess antimicrobial activity. 1 mg mL−1 significantly inhibited the growth of Agrobacterium, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli. Meanwhile, 5 mg mL−1 of CDs inhibited the growth of Pectobacterium and Pseudomonas (Fig. 7(D–G)). CDs at 10 mg mL−1 concentration were found to effectively inhibit Pseudomonas growth with a mean inhibition zone of 32.33 mm, whereas a minimum inhibition zone of 31 mm was observed in the case of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Complete inhibition of bacterial cell growth for Escherichia coli required 16 hours of incubation. Except for Salmonella enterica which required 11 h of incubation, all other bacteria required 5–6 h of incubation with CDs (19 mg mL−1) for complete growth inhibition. Additionally, the antimicrobial activity of these CDs was found to be independent of light. This study suggests that light is not necessarily required for antimicrobial activity of CDs. Moreover, CDs undergo photo-degradation upon light irradiation and show induced cytotoxicity.235,236
Recently, Wang et al. explored the potential of plant root-derived N-CDs as green pesticides. The study reported the in vitro growth inhibitory effects of N-CDs on phytopathogens, Corynespora cassiicola and Phytophtora nicotianae.85Corynespora cassiicola is a phytoparasitic fungus that affects more than 280 plant species by causing target spots on leaves, stems, roots, and flowers.237 The affected plants include many economically important crops such as soybean, cotton, etc.238 Fungus Phytophthora nicotianae is a soil-borne, generally root pathogen causing crown rots, and may attack aerial parts, including stems, leaves, and fruits,239 of herbaceous and woody plants such as ornamentals, tomato, onion, pepper, citrus plants, etc.240 They reported 82.8% and 75.3% inhibitory rates against fungal pathogens, Corynespora cassiicola and Phytophtora nicotianae, respectively, when treated with 11 μL mL−1 of N-CDs. Additionally, N-CDs demonstrated growth enhancement of sorghum seedlings at the same concentration, however, they exhibited toxicity on plants at a higher concentration (500 μL mL−1).85 In a recent study by Zhao et al., seaweed-derived CDs exhibited intrinsic antifungal activity at 40 mg L−1 of CDs, which was able to induce 20% mortality in cucumber downy mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis) in vivo.86 Although the assessment of antimicrobial activity of CDs in most of the studies involved the utilization of human pathogens for conducting in vitro assays. Their application in agriculture can be encouraged because many human pathogens are capable of causing plant diseases and deteriorating crop health and thereby reducing the agricultural yield. The above-mentioned advancements in the antimicrobial activities of CDs suggest their potential application against plant pathogens and disease management, thereby alleviating the biotic stresses in plants. Moreover, the research on CD antimicrobial activity against well-known phytopathogens (Table S4†) is gaining momentum. However, the need for sustainable crop protection strategies necessitates further investigations on the antimicrobial activity of CDs from varied origin on different phytopathogens.
Besides the antimicrobial activity of CDs in plant disease management, CDs also significantly enhance the disease resistance ability of plants. Li et al. studied the effect of CDs on rice blight disease caused by the pathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia solani. Herein, foliarly applied 560 mg L−1 CDs enhanced the disease resistance ability of rice, which significantly increased the crop yield by 14.5%. Through investigation, they revealed that the main reason behind the enhancement of disease resistance is the increase in the thionin (Os06g32600) gene expression. Thionin is an antimicrobial peptide, a part of plant disease defense mechanisms. Mechanistically, CDs interact with DNA after entering the nucleus, loosening it, and boosting the expression of the thionin gene, which eventually leads to the enhancement of the disease resistance ability of rice plant.56
In another study, Luo et al. found that using 10 mg L−1 of N-CDs as a foliar application effectively reduced the symptoms of tomato bacterial wilt syndrome, caused by Ralstonia solanacearum, by 71.19% (Fig. 8A). The disease control efficacy of N-CDs was found to be 1.56-fold higher than un-doped CDs. The proposed mechanisms for this disease suppression were, first, free radical scavenging activity of N-CDs and activation of antioxidant enzymes for relieving oxidative stress (Fig. 8B). Second, activation of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid-dependent systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in tomatoes leading to in vivo pathogen growth arrest (Fig. 8C and D). Moreover, modification with polyacrylic acid (PAA) suppressed the disease resistance ability of N-CDs, due to decreased ROS scavenging and indirect resistance activation (SAR activation and antioxidant upregulation). The in vitro antimicrobial study of N-CDs, un-doped CDs, and PAA-N-CDs on Ralstonia solanacearum show no effect, indicating that suppression of the bacterial wilt can't be due to direct interaction between bacteria and CDs. This can be possibly due to the low concentration (10 mg L−1) used in the assay.186

4. Carbon dot-based sensors
Due to the unique properties of CDs such as tunable fluorescence, considerable electro-conductivity, biocompatibility, and photostability, they are a promising candidate for the design of optical and electrochemical sensors. Due to their wide fluorescence and quenching efficiency, CDs are mostly used for optical sensing and biosensing. In the fluorescence sensing mechanism, CDs show the quenching effect where the energy level of the donor molecule (CD) is nearly the same as the acceptor molecule (target analyte). In that case, the fluorescence of the donor molecule was quenched after the interaction of the acceptor molecule and further recovered by the addition of a suitable reagent. The estimation of fluorescence intensity is to be used for the quantitative or semi-quantitative estimation of analytes.15,16,19,241,242 In this section, CD-based sensors have been discussed for the detection of hazardous materials such as pesticides and herbicides in food and soil.
A fluorescence-based detection of the three pesticides diazinon, glyphosate, and semicarbazone has been developed by Tafreshi et al. using hydrothermally synthesized CDs from cauliflower crop. They mixed the CD solution (1.0 mg mL−1) with different concentrations of pesticides ranging from 0.25 to 5000 ng mL−1. A significant decrease in the fluorescence intensity of CDs has been observed by increasing pesticide concentration owing to the quenching phenomena. The sensor possesses good selectivity even in the presence of other herbicides like dialen super and bromacil, and has excellent performance in food sample such as tomato. This sensor could be also used for sensing in other agricultural products. However, it is difficult to distinguish the three pesticides in a sample.243 Ghosh et al. synthesized CDs from Calotropis procera leaves, with a QY of 71.95% having excitation and emission peaks at 340 and 416 nm, respectively. The authors did the sensing of isoprothiolane pesticide based on fluorescence quenching of CDs having a low limit of detection (LOD) up to the nano-molar concentration in water as well as in fruit and rice samples. Mechanistically, the study revealed that a fluorescence quenching of CDs appears when the electrostatic interactions take place between the surface functionality of CDs and the acetate bond of hydrolyzed isoprothiolane. Additionally, the selectivity of the assay was determined in the presence of various interfering substances such as metal and non-metal ions, and other pesticides, where the developed sensor exhibits high selectivity for isoprothiolane.87
The fluorescence property of the CDs can be remarkably tuned via heteroatom doping and/or surface functionalization. In this case, they create new defects on the CD surface and the overlapping of heteroatom and CD atomic orbitals takes place. As a result, they intensify the fluorescence property of CDs which significantly improves their performance in sensing applications. The doped-CDs can be single or multiple-atom doped.244,245 Liao et al. developed a fluorescent assay for the ratiometric detection of phosalone using dual-wavelength excitation N-CDs. The N-CDs exhibited two excitation bands at 235 and 327 nm with a single emission near 410 nm. When phosalone was added to the N-CD solution, one excitation band (235 nm) get quenched, however, a minimum change was displayed at 327 nm. So, these changes have been used for the sensing of phosalone. Additionally, they further evaluated the accuracy of the sensor compared to gas chromatography (GC) having a very similar sensing performance.246 Similarly, Song et al. developed a N-CD-based fluorescent assay for the ratiometric estimation of pirimicarb in real samples such as tea, apple, and cucumber. The authors found that the prepared N-CDs exhibit two emissive peaks at 400 and 582 nm, in which the emission peak at 400 nm was enhanced while that at 582 nm exhibited no changes after the addition of pirimicarb. The calculation of the peak ratio estimates the pirimicarb. In addition to this, they also determined the pH value of the sensing solution through this assay.247 Successively, Yahyai et al. synthesized sulfur and nitrogen-doped CDs for the development of a paper-based chemiluminescent sensor for the determination of bendiocarb pesticide in fruit juice and water. Herein, they did the sensing of bendiocarb in an acidic medium using S-, N-CDs in the presence of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and sulphite ion (SO3−2). They found that KMnO4 oxidized the S-, N-CDs, and SO3−2 to generate their excited state, which remarkably intensify the luminescence intensity by up to 25%. As a result, they significantly improve the sensitivity and detection ability of the sensor. In addition, the sensor shows an excellent recovery rate between 97.5 and 105.5 in real samples, which determines the high performance of the assay.248 In another study, Li et al. reported S-, N-, B-doped CDs functionalized with a flavonoid (Fla) (N-CDs–Fla, N, S-CDs–Fla and N, S, B-CDs–Fla) based fluorescent assay for the detection of three pesticides, fenitrothion, dithianon and dinoseb simultaneously. Among modified CDs, N-, S-CDs–Fla have high QY due to the N contents and N, S synergistic effect. The inner filter effect and FRET mechanistic study revealed that fenitrothion, dithianon, and dinoseb selectively affected the fluorescence intensity of N-CDs–Fla, N-, S-CDs–Fla, and N-, S-, B-CDs–Fla respectively. Hence, they are detected through their corresponding doped-CD assay. On the above result, they can distinguish these three analytes using three different modified CDs.249 In another study, Man et al. detected the O, O-dimethyl-O-2,2-dichlorovinyl phosphate (DDVP) pesticide using hydrothermally derived CDs from broccoli. The authors did the detection of DDVP based on the inhibition activity. They revealed that the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) shows catalytic activity against acetylcholine chloride (Ach) to generate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which oxidized Fe2+ into Fe3+, where Fe3+ quenched the fluorescence of CDs. However, DDVP inhibited such activity towards AChE, hence they were unable to produce H2O2. In that case, Fe2+ doesn't oxidize; therefore the fluorescence of CDs recovered became the basis of the pesticide concentration estimation. The proposed sensor efficiently detected the wide concentration of DDVP even in food samples such as apple, celery, and cabbage.250 Luo et al. developed B-, N-doped CDs and a CeO2-based fluorescent platform to detect methyl-paraoxon in herbal plant and water. They proposed that CeO2 shows a catalytic reaction towards methyl-paraoxon in a basic medium to convert it into para-nitrophenol and phosphate, where the inner filter effect exists showing that para-nitrophenol diminishes the fluorescence activity of B-, N-CDs within two minutes. This sensing strategy exhibits an excellent dual detection platform, fluorescence as well as visual towards methyl-paraoxon pesticide, where it can be detected visually using fluorescent laminates at 365 nm UV-lamp illumination.251
For further improvement of the sensitivity and working efficiency of CD-based sensors, the CDs have been modified with polymers or metal nanoparticles. Han et al. developed a ratiometric sensor for the detection of thiophanate methyl pesticide based on blue-emitting Cu2+ modified CDs (Cu–CDs) where they displayed dual emissive properties. The Cu–CDs were synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal method using 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol (PAN) and CuCl2. They revealed that the π–π bonding between PAN and pesticide residue existed due to the availability of an aromatic ring in PAN and pesticide. Additionally, the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) shows the existence of complex formation between the pesticide and Cu2+ ions. Both characteristics involve the fluorescence quenching of Cu–CDs which has contributed to the detection of thiophanate methyl.252 Progressively, silver nanoparticle (AgNP) modified CDs were prepared by Carneiro et al. for the sensing of five pesticides namely propanyl, parathion, dimethoate, chlorpyrifos, and pirimicarb at lower concentration up to 250 ng mL−1. The AgNPs were synthesized by the functionalization of sodium polyacrylate (Ag/PAA) and branched polyethyleneimine (Ag/bPEI), which show the fluorescence quenching of CDs through the FRET phenomena. 0.228 and 3.030 pmol L−1 concentration of Ag/PAA and Ag/bPEI respectively were utilized with 100 μg mL−1 concentration of CDs for sensing purposes, where it displayed the highest sensing performance. The authors adopted the ratiometric estimation I2/I1 and I3/I1 of the fluorescence intensity, where I1, I2, and I3 are the intensity of CDs, CDs/pesticide, and CDs/pesticide/AgNPs, respectively.253 In another context, a dual responsive fluorescent sensor was reported by Liang et al. for the detection of malathion in cabbage. Herein, they synthesized gold nanoparticle (AuNP) modified CDs, which exhibited absorption and emission wavelength at 524 and 527 nm, respectively. They concluded that when AuNPs bind to the CDs, the fluorescence property of CDs was quenched which was recovered by adding NaCl, where AuNPs aggregated and recovered the fluorescence of CDs. To further prohibit the AuNP aggregation, the nanomaterial solution was mixed with an aptamer. After adding malathion, it selectively binds to the aptamer. Hence, AuNPs further aggregated and turned from red to blue, which were visualized by the naked eye. Moreover, increasing the malathion concentration resulted in the enhancement of fluorescence intensity. Through this assay, the authors detected malathion with a broad concentration from 1 × 10−9 to 1 × 10−2 M with an excellent recovery rate of 88.7–107.6% (Fig. 9A).254

In a study by Gogoi and Chowdhury, the trifluralin herbicide was detected on a fluorescent sensing platform using Ca2+-modified polyethylene glycol-derived CDs. The introduction of Ca2+ significantly enhances the PL intensity of CDs. However, the PL was diminished by the interaction of trifluralin where 87% of depletion is calculated at the concentration of 149 μM trifluralin, and 45% quenching was shown by trifluralin in the soil at the concentration of 37.40 μM. Additionally, the interference study in the presence of other nitro or fluoride-containing analytes has been evaluated. In such cases, the quenching effect of nitromethane (16.6–166 μM), nitrobenzene (16.2–162 μM), dinitrobenzene and sodium fluoride (15.8–158 μM) was found to be 8, 14, 35 and 14% respectively, which show great promise towards the selective detection of trifluralin.255 Similarly, a glyphosate herbicide was detected by Bera and Mohapatra et al., using CdTe-modified CDs. The CdTe QDs show PL intensity at 619 nm which is lost by the adding CDs. In addition, the red-emissive fluorescence of CdTe QDs at 632 nm was reduced by the increase in CD concentration. However, this was recovered when glyphosate was added into CdTe QD solution at pH 8.0 due to the photoelectron transfer process. They found that the recovery of CdTe QD fluorescence was proportional to the addition of glyphosate concentration. However, such recovery was not found with other molecules like alanine or glycine. Besides, glyphosate enhances the 6-fold fluorescence intensity as compared to other pesticides.256 In a study, Liu et al. detected chlorpyrifos at the femtomolar scale in vegetables and fruits using a chemiluminescence (ECL) aptasensor. Herein, they prepared nanocomposites of AuNPs with molybdenum sulphide and cadmium sulphide (AuNPs@MoS2/CdS) and silver nanoparticles modified CDs (Ag–CDs) nanocomposites, where the emission band (500 nm) of AuNPs@MoS2/CdS nearly matches the absorption wavelength of Ag–CDs (300–600 nm). Therefore, they display the energy resonance transfer process between nanocomposites. This is due to the formation of a hybridized aptasensor, thereby the ECL intensity of AuNPs@MoS2/CdS was lowered. Furthermore, the addition of chlorpyrifos detached the aptameric part of Ag–CDs which recovered the ECL intensity of the sensor. This method was more suitable to detect the broad concentration of these pesticides.257 In a recent study, a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)-based fluorescent sensor was reported by Shirani et al. based on silicon doped-CDs (Si–CDs) for the detection of indoxacarb with an LOD of 1.0 nM. A sol–gel process was employed to generate the imprinting site using an indoxacarb template in the presence of APTES on the Si–CDs surface to form a MIP@Si–CDs sensor, where the fluorescence activity of MIP was quenched by the target indoxacarb analyte. The advantages of the MIP sensor are that it could be regenerated by simply centrifugation and water/ethanol washing and used up to 10 times without affecting its performance.258 Recently, a smartphone-enable sensing platform was developed by Su et al. using red emissive CDs and cobalt oxyhydroxide nanosheets (CoOOH–CDs) for the detection of 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) herbicide. In this system, the fluorescence of CDs has been quenched by CoOOH, where it gets reduced up to 88% using 3.75 μg mL−1 CoOOH. The detection of 2,4-D was based on the fluorescence recovery of CDs where it was recovered by the catalytic activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) towards ascorbic acid-2-phosphate trisodium salt (AAP) to generate ascorbic acid which detaches the CDs from CoOOH–CDs. However, 2,4-D inhibited such activity of ALP, which lowers the fluorescence intensity of CDs. Such detection of 2,4-D was monitored by using the smartphone device which offers on-site detection within 30 min having 100 μg L−1 LOD (Fig. 9B).259 Besides, the CD-based fluorescence sensors, electrochemical and colorimetric sensors are also reported for the detection of hazardous chemicals in food samples. However, very limited studies are reported in this field. Due to the extended length of the article, we excluded discussing more details about electrochemical and colorimetric sensors in the text, but we included them in Table S5.†
The reported CD-based sensor is a good candidate for the detection of various analytes including pesticides and herbicides in agricultural products. These are only based on the measure of their change in fluorescence intensity. However, further research is still required in this area to construct a highly sensitive sensor platform (electrochemical, microfluidics) other than fluorescence ones for rapidly sensing food and other products. Additionally, this work can be expanded to develop an integrated, flexible, and wearable sensor that serves as a promising candidate for on-site sensing of not only toxic chemicals and heavy metals but also plant growth, micronutrients, and the abiotic and biotic stress of plants, which can aid farmers in practicing better agriculture.260–262 The details of CD-based sensors for the detection of pesticides and herbicides are listed in Table S5.†
5. Challenges of carbon dots in sustainable agriculture
Despite the significant potential of CDs in the agricultural system, including as plant growth enhancers, controllers of biotic and abiotic stress, potent antimicrobial agents, and suitable materials for the fabrication of sensors, their applications in agriculture are still in the early stages and the transition from lab to field must overcome several barriers. The greenness of the synthesis methodology affects the bio-safety of CDs, which contributes to sustainability. However, CDs face purity issues, low QY and challenges of large-scale synthesis. For application in agriculture, high-quality CDs are required, thus, standardizing the purification steps during synthesis is crucial.263 While plant-based green synthesis has an average QY of around 14%, CDs synthesized from Calotropis procera leaves have reported a QY of 71.95%.87 Further research aiming to improve the QY of CDs through plant-mediated synthesis would help overcome this challenge. Nevertheless, CDs have shown antimicrobial effects and could substantially help plants against phytopathogens and pests, but they may also pose a potential threat to soil-beneficial microbial communities. CDs have shown enhancement of the nitrogen fixation capacity of Azotobacter chroococcum, in vitro.264 However, evaluation of the potential impact on non-target organisms is required for their safe application in agriculture.
CDs' effects are dose dependent on plants and vary from crop to crop. However, the reported literature only supports small-scale research in plant growth enhancement. Therefore, the dose needs to be carefully optimized to upsurge large-scale utilization. Moreover, the understanding of absorption, translocation, and distribution of CDs in plants is still in its infancy and needs further exploration. In addition, the mechanism of interaction between CDs and plants requires more investigation. Phytotoxicity associated with CDs is another bottleneck to conquer. Limited studies have proposed that some degree of toxicity is associated with CDs. This can certainly challenge their use in agriculture. Studies also revealed that higher doses of CDs adversely affect plant growth.130–132 Hence, dose optimization before the application would reduce the risk of phytotoxicity. At present, we lack adequate knowledge regarding the bioaccumulation of CDs in plants and animals and their subsequent entry into the food chain. Therefore, more research in this area would provide better clarity regarding the eco-toxicity of CDs and can certainly facilitate their application in agriculture. Apart from this, CD-based sensors are very promising for agricultural monitoring. However, the research in this field is in a nascent stage. Further research in this area would open new avenues for agricultural monitoring and plant bioelectronics. In spite of these challenges, CDs have considerable potential as promising agricultural enhancers and could contribute to efficient farming in the future. However, overcoming these barriers would smoothen their large-scale application.
6. Conclusions and futuristic outlook
The emergence of CDs as agricultural yield enhancers is a topic of growing interest among researchers. The present review highlights the applicability of CDs in agriculture with the advent of recent research developments. CDs represent a promising non-toxic and remarkable biocompatible CNM to be applied in agriculture. CDs have received success in addressing various challenges faced by the agriculture sector. With the exception of a few studies, CDs have shown enhancement effects on plants, including growth and resistance against biotic and abiotic stress. Studies on plant system and CD interaction revealed that CDs can accelerate seed germination, mineral nutrient uptake, and photosynthesis. Additionally, CDs' broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity makes them potential agents against various phytopathogens, and their intrinsic free-radical scavenging activity benefits plants in alleviating abiotic stress.
Although considerable developments have been made in this area of research on CDs, further research is needed to broaden the understanding of their potential application in agriculture. In this section, future research prospects of CDs in the field of agriculture will be discussed in brief, which can also be seen in Fig. 10.
 Fig. 10  Future aspects of applications of CDs in agriculture. 
To expand the application of CDs as antimicrobials against plant pathogens, further research is needed to investigate their in vivo application for plant disease management. Additionally, the agricultural industry experiences significant losses due to phytoviruses. Nano-phyto-virology is a developing field, which addresses the adverse effect of plant viral diseases and their nanotechnological management.265 CNTs and C60 fullerenes have been reported to inhibit the replication of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in Nicotiana benthamiana.266 Due to their potent antiviral activities against clinically relevant pathogens, CDs may also be promising against plant viruses.267 Considering the antimicrobial activity of CDs, seed treatment can also protect the seed against microbial infections, thus ensuring their safety and increasing their shelf-life. Excessive utilization of agro-chemicals including pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, fertilizers, and so on has deleterious effects on the environment, therefore, their controlled application is necessary. A recent study demonstrated the potential of CDs as a fungicide carrier with a high loading efficiency of 47.18%. The authors proposed that CDs can hold pesticides through hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonds.86 The nanocarrier application of CDs can be further investigated for controlled and smart delivery of agrochemicals, contributing to precision farming. Moreover, Schwartz et al. demonstrated efficient delivery of siRNA and gene silencing in Nicotiana bentamiana and tomato for crop improvement suggesting CDs' use in plant genomics and agriculture.268 Soil nutrients are essential for plant growth and a reduction in their quantity can negatively affect crop growth, thus, it is important to closely monitor the nutrient content in soil. Recently, carbon nanodot-neutral red-based sensing of nitrogen in soil and water samples using a smartphone with 0.1–3 μg mL−1 accuracy has been reported. This involves photometric and fluorescence-based sensing. This facilitates convenient on-site assessment of nitrite in soil.269 Such CDs and smartphone-based agriculture sensors have potential for the onsite assessment of other parameters (micro- and macro-nutrients, temperature, moisture, etc.) of soil. The fluorescence properties of CDs have been extensively exploited for bioimaging. Additionally, fluorescent labeling and sensing of microorganisms by CDs have been reported.270 On similar grounds, the fluorescence-based detection of plant phytopathogens can be a promising tool for crop disease management and preventing agricultural loss. Furthermore, since the phosphorescence of CDs holds applications in sensing and bioimaging, phosphorescence-based CDs sensors along with fluorescence-based ones can be promising for agricultural monitoring. CDs can be potentially applied in plant bioelectronics involving implantable sensors and epidermal/wearable sensors that can be attached to the leaf or stem for monitoring plant health.271,272

Environmental significance
This review presents an approach towards sustainable agriculture which is very much needed for ensuring food security and maintaining the resilience of the environment. This review addresses some challenges faced by the agriculture sector along with its relevance to the environment. Carbon dots (CDs) exhibit remarkable biocompatibility and negligible environmental toxicity when used in optimum concentration, making them appropriate for the growth of plant species in particular, without raising any environmental concern. Moreover, CDs as nano-fertilizers are promising alternatives for chemical fertilizers for plant growth enhancement, which can enhance agricultural productivity. This review also illustrates the application of CD based sensors for agricultural monitoring which aids in checking agrochemical overuse in the soil and environment beyond the permissible levels.
