    , Accepted 4th December 2017First published on 8th January 2018AbstractThe aim of increasing the production ratio of endohedral C60 by impinging foreign atoms against C60 is a crucial matter of the science and technology employed towards industrialization of these functional building block materials. Among these endohedral fullerenes, Li+@C60 exhibits a wide variety of physical and chemical phenomena and has the potential to be applicable in areas spanning the medical field to photovoltaics. However, currently, Li+@C60 can be experimentally produced with only ∼1% ratio using the plasma shower method with a 30 eV kinetic energy provided to the impinging Li+ ion. From extensive first-principles molecular dynamics simulations, it is found that the maximum production ratio of Li+@C60 per hit is increased to about 5.1% (5.3%) when a Li+ ion impinges vertically on a six-membered ring of C60 with 30 eV (40 eV) kinetic energy, although many C60 molecules are damaged during this collision. On the contrary, when it impinges vertically on a six-membered ring with 10 eV kinetic energy, the production ratio remains at 1.3%, but the C60 molecules are not damaged at all. On the other hand, when the C60 is randomly oriented, the production ratio reduces to about 3.7 ± 0.5%, 3.3 ± 0.5%, and 0.2 ± 0.03% for 30 eV, 40 eV, and 10 eV kinetic energy, respectively. Based on these observations we demonstrate the possibility of increasing the production ratio by fixing six-membered rings atop C60 using the Cu(111) substrate or UV light irradiation. In order to assess the ideal experimental production ratio, the 7Li solid NMR spectroscopy measurement is also performed for the multilayer randomly oriented C60 sample irradiated by Li+ using the plasma shower method combined with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Time-of-flight mass spectroscopy measurements are also performed to cross check whether Li+@C60 molecules are produced in the sample. The resulting experimental estimate, 4% for 30 eV incident kinetic energy, fully agrees with our simulation results mentioned above, suggesting the consistency and accuracy of our simulations and experiments.
1. Introduction
The global synthesis of endohedral fullerenes using foreign atom insertion in the most abundant fullerene, C60, has been a challenge in the science and technology towards industrialization of these functional building block materials.2 So far, a variety of atoms, such as Li, Na, K,3–8 Be,9,10,11,12 He, Ne,2,13 Xe,14 As, Ge,15 N,16–20 Se,21 and Po,22 have been tested to be encapsulated into C60 by bombardment. Amongst them, only Li@C60 has been produced by plasma techniques on a massive scale. In earlier experiments, Campbell and coauthors5,6 reported that a Li+ ion is captured inside C60 above 6 eV kinetic energy in accordance with earlier3 and recent38 theories and that the yield for capture becomes highest at 30 eV kinetic energy. Their estimate of the yield was, however, surprisingly high, ∼50% (∼30%), when Li+ ions hit the monolayer (overlayer) C60 molecules. Recently, Li+@C60 endohedral fullerene material has been produced with a production ratio of about ∼1%, using our plasma shower method,23–28 and has been made available commercially. The production ratio here is defined as the number of the product Li+@C60 molecules divided by the total number of the supplied C60 molecules. Since then, several investigations have been performed on this new nanomaterial.29–40 It has the potential to significantly increase the energy conversion efficiency of thin film organic solar cells29–31 and is also shown to be a suitable candidate for application in switches,32 ionic conductors,33 and other areas of fundamental interest.34–38 Importantly, the Diels–Alder reaction using one Li+@C60 to attach modifying groups has been demonstrated to be accelerated by about 2, 400 times compared to using pure C60.39 A similar speed-up has been achieved in the case of surrounding Li+@C60 by an OH group.40 This makes medical applications such as drug delivery systems more easier to achieve.
Due to these attractive aspects of Li+@C60, it is imperative to increase its production ratio. However, a detailed scientific understanding of the experimental setup is necessary before any progress can be made in this direction. In the plasma shower experimental device, Li atoms and C60 molecules are simultaneously and continuously supplied from the opposite sides of a vacuum chamber. On the one side, Li atoms are ionized and electrons are emitted at the same instance, forming a collisionless Li plasma that flows along magnetic-field lines, while on the other side, C60 molecules are adsorbed on a metal substrate such as stainless steel. Since the metal substrate is negatively biased about 30 V against the chamber ground, the electric field is generated in the sheath region less than ∼5 mm from the substrate, where no electrons exist and only Li+ ions in this region are accelerated.41 Therefore, the bias voltage, i.e., Li+ energy, can be very strictly controlled. Thus Li+ ions, which always collide vertically with C60 molecules in the top layer with 30 eV kinetic energy, are efficiently encapsulated in C60. This process is continued by the layer-by-layer adsorption of C60 and by the continuous flow of Li+ ions in the sheath region. Due to this synthesis technique, the C60 molecules can be freely rotating.
An important question here is, what is the upper limit of the production ratio? In earlier experiments, Campbell et al.5,6 have shown the yield dependence on the incident kinetic energy of Li+. Their estimate of the yield was significantly larger than the current production ratio ∼1% in our plasma shower method. This discrepancy is simply because their definition of the yield was the number of Li+@C60 molecules (possibly including largely deformed LiC60 complexes also) against the number of undamaged C60 molecules after Li+ irradiation. Therefore, it is highly desirable to estimate the upper limit of the production ratio, which should be the number of pure product Li+@C60 against the total number of supplied C60.
In the present paper, in order to predict the ideal production ratio per hit as a function of the incident kinetic energy of Li+ and to propose a strategy to further increase the production ratio of Li+@C60, we perform extensive first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with different kinetic energies, different angles, and different collision points, which are either at the center or off-center of five- and six-membered rings. In addition, we carry out an experiment to determine the upper limit of the production ratio and compare this result with that of the first-principles MD simulations.
2. Methodology
We use the latest version of the first-principles program TOMBO,14,45,46 in which not only plane waves (with 7 Ry cutoff energy) but also numerical atomic orbitals (1s, 2s and 2p for C and 1s for Li) confined within non-overlapping atomic spheres are used as basis functions (“all-electron mixed basis approach”) within a 14 Å simple cubic unit cell. All calculations are based on the local spin density approximation47 in density functional theory (DFT). As explained in the ESI,† the van der Waals interaction between carbon atoms can be effectively treated within this approximation. Upon each update of atomic positions, a full matrix diagonalization is repeated ten times to achieve self-consistency and to conserve the total energy.48 We simply set the initial kinetic energy of Li or Li+ at a value corresponding to the bias applied to the substrate. During the simulation, the total energy is conserved because we perform enough SCF loops to reduce the energy dissipation as far as possible. We do not apply any further constraint on the trajectory of Li or Li+. Therefore, the situation corresponds to the (microcanonical) NVE ensemble in MD. The basic time step is set at Δt = 0.5 fs.
In our simulation, we only consider one Li atom (or one Li+ ion) hitting one C60 molecule, therefore, there is no reason to expect two Li atoms encapsulated in one C60 molecule. In some experimental conditions where many Li atoms hit the same C60 molecule, two or more Li atoms may get encapsulated. In our plasma shower experiments, however, the number of Li atoms and C60 molecules is controlled in a way that one Li+ ion hits one C60 molecule in the topmost layer. Therefore, the probability that two Li atoms are encapsulated in the same C60 molecule6 must be quite low, although this probability is of course not zero. In such a situation, the production ratio can be regarded as the encapsulation probability per one Li attack against one C60 molecule, and we use this definition below to estimate it.
The following experimental equipments are used in the present study: Shimadzu's AXIMA-CFR MALDI mass spectrometer and a Bruker SolariX 9.4 Tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron (FT-ICR) resonance mass spectrometer for time-of-flight mass spectroscopy, and JEOL JNM-ECA 800, which uses an 18.8 Tesla superconducting magnet, for solid NMR measurements. Moreover, Shimadzu inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP AES, ICPE-9000) is used to determine the concentrations of the Li atoms and Li ions. For related chemical shift calculations to justify the experimental assignments, the Gaussian 09 package program49 with the B3LYP exchange–correlation functional is used; the basis set, 6-311++g(d,p) is used for the 7Li NMR calculations.
3. Computational results
Since the C60 molecules are generally spaced at an intermolecular distance of more than 9 Å, here we consider just one Li atom and one C60 molecule in our simulation cell for simplicity. Simulations are performed mainly with six different initial kinetic energies, Ekinetic = 10 eV, 20 eV, 30 eV, 40 eV, 50 eV, and 60 eV, provided to a Li atom placed at z = 5 Å from the C60 center (0,0,0) with an incident angle α from the normal (z) direction toward the impinging point at (x,y), where (0,0) is the center of the topmost five-/six-membered ring, and x and y are the directions toward the center of a single (or double) bond and the position slightly off (or just on) a carbon atom, respectively.
When a double bond is atop, it is surrounded by two adjoining six-membered rings with a tilt angle of 21° as well as two five-membered rings with a tilt angle of 32° as shown in Fig. 1(a). On the other hand, when a single bond is atop, it is surrounded by three six-membered rings with tilt angles of 21° and 36° and one five-membered ring with an angle slightly less than 21° as shown in Fig. 1(b). The angle between the adjacent two six-membered rings is 42°, while the angle between the adjacent five- and six-membered rings is 38°. We discuss the impingement on the six-membered ring followed by the five-membered ring. Here, we simulate a neutral Li atom hitting neutral C60. In this case, when Li comes close to C60, an electron transfer automatically occurs from Li to C60, resulting in Li+ and C60−, although the ionicity symbol is not explicitly written in what follows. This ion-pair formation is expected in actual Li+ injection on the C60−-adsorbed surface. In the other case, we simulate Li+ hitting neutral C60, separately. Concerning the results for the impingement on the six-membered ring, there was no difference between the Li+ + C60− simulation and the Li+ + C60 simulation, because electron transfer from Li to C60 mainly occurs through five membered rings only. Therefore, those results are not distinguished and are all summarized in Table 1, in which D, E, B, and G denote, respectively, the destruction of C60, encapsulation, bounce, and going through C60. The results differ according to the initial kinetic energy (of Li) Ekinetic, the impinging position (x,y), and the incident angle α. On the other hand, for the impingement on the five-membered ring, there were some differences between those simulations. Therefore, for this five-membered ring case, the results of the Li+ + C60− simulation and those of the Li+ + C60 simulation are separately listed in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.

3.1. Impingement on the six-membered ring
Because the results of the Li+ + C60− simulation and Li+ + C60 simulation are the same, we do not distinguish them and describe them together. For Ekinetic = 10 eV and α = 0°, the Li atom is successfully encapsulated in C60 for . When the Li atom vertically impinges at a slightly off-center position, (0.3,0) Å (no. 3 in Table 1; see Fig. 2), it is bounced at the off-center position near a double bond (t = 15 fs; Fig. 2(b)) to the other side (near a single bond) of the six-membered ring (t = 25 fs; Fig. 2(c)), and is encapsulated in C60 (t > 45 fs; Fig. 2(d)–(i)). In contrast, when α = 21° (no. 5) or α = 0° with  (no. 4), the Li atom bounces off the C60 cage surface without damaging it. Fig. 3 shows the snapshots of a case from no. 4, where the Li atom vertically hits the C60 molecule at (0.5,0) Å. Here, the Li atom attacks from one side of the ring (t = 8 fs; Fig. 3(b)) and is reflected to the other side (t = 20 fs; Fig. 3(c)), bounced off from the C60 without damaging it. This in-ring bounce-off leads to the Li atom being repelled from the C60 molecule (t = 26 to 54.5 fs; Fig. 3(d)–(f)), thereby not causing encapsulation. Overall, in the case of Ekinetic = 10 eV, C60 either keeps its structure or becomes Li@C60, although the production ratio of Li@C60 per hit is small. The production ratio per hit can be estimated from the ratio of the encapsulation area of the six-membered ring atop C60 and the cross section area of the C60 molecule. The encapsulation area is roughly 0.42π Å2, while the C60 cross section is roughly 3.52π Å2. Therefore, we estimate the production ratio per hit to be about 1.3% in the case of Ekinetic = 10 eV.
 Fig. 2  Snapshots of the simulation, when Li vertically collides at (0.3,0) Å of a six-membered ring at 0° with an initial kinetic energy of 10 eV (no. 3 of Table 1). It attacks near a double bond between the carbon atoms, and is bounced to the other side of the six-membered ring before being finally encapsulated in C60. The direction of view is along the x-axis. 
 Fig. 3  Snapshots of the simulation, when Li collides at (0.5,0) Å of a six-membered ring at 0° with an initial kinetic energy of 10 eV (no. 4 in Table 1). It attacks near the center of a double bond and moves to the other side of the six-membered ring before being bounced off the surface of C60. The direction of view is shown. 
If the initial kinetic energy Ekinetic is increased with α = 0°, the Li atom gets encapsulated through the six-membered ring for . For Ekinetic = 20 eV, a ∼ 0.2 Å and b ∼ 0.6 Å as indicated in no. 11; for 30 eV, a ∼ 0.2 Å and b ∼ 0.8 Å as indicated in no. 12; for 40 eV, a ∼ 0.3 Å and b ∼ 0.9 Å as indicated in no. 13 (*although going through (“G”) at (0.4, 0) etc. in no. 8) of Table 1. Unlike the 10 eV case, when the Li atom vertically hits near the center of the six-membered ring (no. 6–9), it passes through both the top and lower (not necessarily the bottom) six-membered rings, i.e., it does not get encapsulated but simply goes through the C60 molecule as indicated by symbol “G” in Table 1. Fig. 4 shows snapshots of the simulation no. 6, where the Li atom vertically hits the center of the six-membered ring, i.e., (0,0) with Ekinetic = 30 eV. It passes through both the topmost and lowermost six-membered rings, and simply goes through the C60 molecule.

For nonzero angles α > 0°, encapsulation occurs through the six-membered rings within an area expressed by  as no. 15, 16, 19, and 22–25 in Table 1; see also the discussion in section 5. Fig. 5 shows snapshots of the simulation no. 22, where the Li atom hits near a carbon atom at (0.8,0) Å with Ekinetic = 30 eV and α = 36°. At 5 fs (Fig. 5(b)), the Li atom hits a double bond. Subsequently, it hits another double bond on the opposite side before being pushed into the cage (t = 11 to 25 fs; Fig. 5(c)–(e)), very similar to the vertical impingement of the Li atom on the same system. After the in-ring bounce-off at t = 63 fs (Fig. 5(f)), the Li atom continuously bounces in the cage until its kinetic energy is eventually expended (t = 90 to 212 fs; Fig. 5(g)–(i)).

It attacks near the center of a single bond and is pushed into the cage. After encapsulation, it bounces repeatedly in C60. The direction of viewing is shown. 
Whereas, for  even with α = 0°, the Li atom is bounced on the C60 cage surface (as in no. 28 and 29 of Table 1) whilst pushing one or two carbon atoms inside the cage and significantly damaging C60. Fig. 6 shows snapshots of the simulation no. 29, where the Li atom attacks at a completely off-center position (0,2.0) Å with α = 0°. In this case, the Li atom uses the C60 molecule as a ‘launchpad’ to bounce away from it (t = 10 to 30 fs; Fig. 6(c)–(e)). In doing so, it significantly damages the structure of C60 as reflected by the inward movement of a C–C bond (t = 10 to 30 fs; Fig. 6(c)–(e)). This continues until this bond is ‘encapsulated’ (t = 74.5 to 309.5 fs; Fig. 6(f)–(i)). Due to this, a heavy structural reconstruction occurs whereby the vacancy caused by the movement of this bond facilitates the formation of a seven-membered ring (marked orange from Fig. 6(f) onwards), thereby closing the cage. In addition to the formation of this new ring as well as encapsulation of the C–C bond, the entire structure rotates on its axis, evident from the circular motion of the seven-membered ring (t = 359.5 to 719.5 fs; Fig. 6(j)–(l)). Thus, from these results, we summarize that encapsulation can take place for Ekinetic ≥ 8 eV, while Ekinetic = 30 eV (40 eV) is required, when Li is incident within an angle of 36° (42°). (The encapsulation area becomes smaller for finite angles α > 0 as discussed in section 5.) We estimate the production ratio per hit to be about (0.82 − 0.12)/(3.5) 2 ∼ 5.1% for Ekinetic = 30 eV if a six-membered ring is oriented upward.
 Fig. 6  Snapshots of the simulation when Li vertically collides at (0,3.0) Å of a six-membered ring with an initial kinetic energy of 30 eV (no. 29 of Table 1). It attacks carbon atoms directly below it and as a result bounces off the surface of C60 (t = 10–30 fs). Then, the two carbon atoms hit by the Li atom get encapsulated in C60. In this process, the carbon atoms that are colored orange form a seven-membered ring (t = 74.5 to 309.5 fs), thereby closing the cage structure. During the encapsulation of the two carbon atoms, the entire cage rotates around its axis as reflected by the change in the position of the seven-membered ring. The direction of viewing is along the x-axis. 
3.2. Impingement on the five-membered ring
In this case, the results of the Li+ + C60− simulation and the Li+ + C60 simulation are slightly different. First we describe the result of the former simulation, and second we just explain the cases where the result of the latter simulation is different from that of the former simulation.

3.2.1. Li+ + C60− simulations. 
For Ekinetic = 10 eV or 20 eV even with α = 0°, Li encapsulation does not occur for any of the collision points. No. 30 of Table 2 corresponds to the case when the impingement occurs at the center of the five-membered ring, signified by the symbol “B”. However, when Ekinetic is increased to 30 eV, encapsulation occurs when the Li atom hits a certain small area around the center of the five-membered ring with a zero or small tilt angle. Fig. 7 shows snapshots of simulation no. 36, where the Li atom collides at (0.3,0) Å with α = 21°. The atom hits one of the single bonds (t = 4 to 13 fs; Fig. 7(b)–(c)). As a result of this impact, the five-membered ring becomes larger and larger, and the Li atom penetrates into the cage structure (t = 22 fs; Fig. 7(d)). This inward movement is continued due to the high kinetic energy possessed by the atom, until it reaches the bottom of the cage (t = 35 to 58 fs; Fig. 7(e)–(f)). The Li atom continuously bounces in the cage until its kinetic energy is completely expended (t = 122 to 255 fs; Fig. 7(g)–(i)). However, if α is increased to 32°, the Li atom is bounced off the top five-membered ring (no. 39). Overall, for α = 0° and  with a and b written in no. 32 and 34 of Table 2, encapsulation can take place. The encapsulation area becomes smaller for finite angles α > 0 as expressed by  as in no. 36, 37, and 40–42 in Table 2. For  with α = 0°, the atom bounces off, leaving behind a swollen C60 molecule (C60 will soon recover the original form), in the case of 30 eV, while the atom is encapsulated with significant deformation of C60 (although soon recovered) in the case of 40 and 50 eV, as indicated in no. 34 of Table 2. Interestingly, the case for the Li atom vertically impinging on a five-membered ring with Ekinetic = 30 eV is very similar to that of the vertical impingement on a six-membered ring with Ekinetic = 10 eV. This implies that the production ratio per hit in this case is also nearly 1% if a five-membered ring is oriented upward; but this is not the correct estimate as discussed in section 5.
 Fig. 7  Snapshots of the simulation, when Li collides at (0.3,0) Å of a five-membered ring at a tilt angle of 21° with respect to the vertical plane of the molecule with an initial kinetic energy of 30 eV (no. 36 in Table 2). It attacks near the center of a single bond and penetrates into the cage. After encapsulation, it bounces repeatedly in C60. The direction of view is shown. 


3.2.2. Li+ + C60 simulations. 
Next, we describe the results of the Li+ + C60 simulation, which are summarized in Table 3. Here, in order to avoid redundancy, we just explain the cases where the result of the Li+ + C60 simulation is different from that of the Li+ + C60− simulation explained in section 3.2.1. Although encapsulation did not occur for the previous Li+ + C60− case of Ekinetic = 20 eV, Li+ is encapsulated by the vertical hit at the center of the five-membered ring with Ekinetic = 20 eV as indicated by the symbol “E” in no. 44 of Table 3. For the vertical impingement at  with Ekinetic = 50 eV, Li+ goes through the C60 cage although it was encapsulated inside C60− in the previous case.
For nonzero angles α > 0°, the values a and b for the encapsulation area  are slightly different from the previous Li+ + C60− simulations as indicated in no. 52–54 and 57–59 of Table 3.

4. Experimental results
In the plasma shower method, C60 molecules are sublimated and deposited on a metal substrate at one side of the vacuum chamber and simultaneously Li atoms are also sublimated and ionized to become Li+ + e− plasma at the other side of the chamber. Then, Li ions are accelerated in the sheath region within a distance ∼5 mm from the substrate biased at −30 V.
In the present study, in order to accurately estimate the production ratio per one Li attack, we prepared at the outset a multilayer C60 sample deposited on a stainless steel (SUS) substrate. The C60 film thickness was 5–50 μm, which corresponds to 5000 to 50000 layers. We set it inside the vacuum chamber and irradiated the Li ions using the same method as described above but with three different bias voltages: −6 V, −10 V, and −30 V. The irradiated sample was then dissolved by small amount of ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), and dripped into a large amount of normal hexane to precipitate. This precipitate was used as the sample after filtration and vacuum drying. The resulting sample was ∼15 mg for each bias voltage. For this sample, we first performed time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectroscopy measurements for −6 V, −10 V, and −30 V bias voltages. The upper and lower figures of Fig. 8(a)–(c) represent the results for the 6 eV, 10 eV, and 30 eV samples and the corresponding very simple predictive calculations, respectively. (a) for 6 eV shows only m/z = 720, 721, 722, and 723 peaks corresponding to pure 12C60 (100%), 12C5913C (66.7%), 12C5813C2 (21.9%), and 12C5713C3 (4.71%) according to the natural abundance of 13C (1.10%). Therefore, we conclude that no encapsulation takes place at 6 eV. Next, the lower figure of (b) for 10 eV shows m/z = 726, 727, 728, 729, and 730 peaks corresponding to 6Li+@12C60, 7Li+@12C60, 7Li+@12C5913C, 7Li+@12C5813C2, and 7Li+@12C5713C3, respectively, while the upper figure shows a slightly higher peak at m/z = 727 among many hydride peaks at all integer values. Thus, we found that a small amount of C60 became endohedral Li@C60 at 10 eV. Finally, (c) for 30 eV shows clear m/z = 720, 721, 722, 727, 728, and 729 peaks corresponding to 12C60, 12C5913C, 12C5813C2, 7Li+@12C60, 7Li+@12C5913C, and 7Li+@12C5813C2, respectively. Therefore, a relatively large amount of endohedral Li@C60 was created at 30 eV. At least in these TOF mass spectroscopy measurements, when the laser power was relatively small, we did not observe any sign indicating oligomerisation as discussed in ref. 50. This result is consistent with the simulations (see Table 1). Thus, we conclude that the threshold energy at which Li+ encapsulation becomes possible is between 6 and 10 eV.
 Fig. 8  The time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectra of the multilayer C60 samples irradiated by Li+ with (a) −6 V, (b) −10 V, and (c) −30 V bias voltages. 
We also performed a solid NMR measurement to determine the production ratio from the ratio of the solid 7Li NMR absorption cross sections. Fig. 9 shows the resulting solid 7Li NMR spectra of the ∼5 mg sample. The absorptions near 0 ppm and ∼−12 ppm correspond to exohedral 7LiC60 and endohedral 7Li@C60, respectively, according to the chemical shift. (Using the gauge including atomic orbital method, we found that the −12 ppm chemical shift is attributed to Li@C60.) The ratio of the two absorption peak areas is 0.02, indicating that 2% of Li attacking C60 is encapsulated inside C60. The experimental details are explained as follows:
1. 16 μg Li was sublimated, ionized, and irradiated to a ϕ = 20 mm SUS substrate with −30 V bias voltage. (Note that not all Li atoms were ionized to Li+. See the discussion given below.)
2. This process was repeated three times. Therefore, the total amount of Li irradiated to three ϕ = 20 mm SUS substrates was 48 μg (6.92 μmol).
3. According to the solid NMR spectra, we found that 2% of 6.92 μmol, i.e., 0.138 μmol Li, was encapsulated in C60.
 Fig. 9  
7Li solid NMR spectra obtained by the Li+ attack accelerated with a bias voltage of −30 V onto C60 multilayers; the main peak indicates the soft exohedral Li adsorptions and the side peak indicates Li+@C60. 
However, because some of the Li atoms were not ionized and not accelerated by the bias voltage, they were able to contribute to the exohedral 7LiC60 only. Therefore, the encapsulation ratio of 2% mentioned above is somewhat an underestimation for the ideal production ratio. To estimate the ideal production ratio, we used inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), and measured the amounts of Li atoms or Li ions adsorbed on the substrate separately under two conditions. One is under positive bias voltage, where only neutral Li atoms can be adsorbed on the substrate, and the other is under negative bias voltage, where both Li and Li+ can be adsorbed on the substrate. From this experiment, the Li+ and Li ratio was found to be ca. 1:1. It is obvious that the neutral Li atoms can only contribute to the exohedral 7LiC60. Therefore, if these neutral Li atoms were all ionized to Li+, an additional 2% of these Li+ would contribute to the endohedral 7Li@C60. Thus, we conclude that the total amount of the production ratio is ∼ 4%.
5. Discussion
The production ratios in section 3 are computed assuming that the impingement process occurs either only on the six-membered ring or the five-membered ring atop the C60 molecule. The situation where the six-membered ring is atop can be realized when C60 molecules are adsorbed on a Cu(111) surface42,43 or irradiated by UV light to form the bonds with (2 + 2) cycloadditional four-membered rings.44 However, the above estimate of the production ratio is incorrect, because there is also a possibility that encapsulation takes place through the surrounding rings. Moreover, in the current plasma shower setup, the C60 molecules are piled up layer-by-layer on a stainless steel substrate. In such a case, the molecules can be randomly oriented. This fact must be taken into consideration when estimating the correct production ratio.
Here we consider the results of the Li + C60 simulation. (The results of the Li+ + C60 simulation are similar.) For Ekinetic = 30 eV, when the double bond is atop the molecule (Fig. 1(a)), encapsulation is guaranteed to occur if the Li atom is impinged with α = 21° on either of the two six-membered rings within a radius of  (no. 16 in Table 1). Fig. 10 explains why the center of this encapsulation area is shifted toward x > 0. However, it bounces off the five-membered ring inclined by 32° (no. 39 in Table 2 and no. 55 in Table 3), owing to the small kinetic energy attacking the small region at a large angle. (For Ekinetic ≥ 40 eV, it is encapsulated through the five-membered ring; see no. 40–42 in Table 2 and no. 57–59 in Table 3). In the case of the single bond atop the molecule (Fig. 1(b)), encapsulation occurs in most rings. For the five-membered ring tilted 21°, the radius of encapsulation is b ∼ 0.0–0.3 Å for  (no. 36–38 in Table 2 and no. 52–54 in Table 3), whereas for the other one (tilted 21°) and two (tilted 36°) six-membered rings, it is b ∼ 0.0–0.5 Å (no. 16, 19, and 20 in Table 1) and b ∼ 0.2–0.3 Å (no. 22–25 in Table 1). From these observations, we estimate the production ratio per hit as follows:
• When a six-membered ring is atop, encapsulation is only possible through the topmost six-membered ring, whose area of encapsulation for 30 eV is about (0.82 − 0.12)π Å2. Therefore, the production ratio is 5.1% for 30 eV, 5.3% for 40 eV, 1.8% for 50 eV, and 0.4% for 60 eV.
• When a five-membered ring is atop, encapsulation is possible through either the topmost five-membered ring or the surrounding five six-membered rings; their areas of encapsulation for 30 eV are about 0.42π Å2 and 0.252πcos38° Å2, respectively. The correct production ratio is 3.3% rather than 1%. It becomes 2.8% for 40 eV, 1.5% for 50 eV, and 0.7% for 60 eV.
• When a double bond is atop (Fig. 1(a)), encapsulation is only possible through two six-membered rings, whose area of encapsulation for 30 eV is about 0.52πcos21° Å2 and the production ratio is 3.8%. The production ratio becomes 2.8% for 40 eV, 0.3% for 50 eV, and 0.0% for 60 eV.
• When a single bond is atop (Fig. 1(b)), the areas of encapsulation for 30 eV are about 0.052πcos21°, 0.452πcos21°, and 0.252πcos36° Å2, respectively, for one five-membered ring, one six-membered ring sharing the topmost single bond, and the other two six-membered rings. The resulting production ratio is 2.4%. It becomes 2.5% for 40 eV, 0.8% for 50 eV, and 0.3% for 60 eV.
 Fig. 10  Illustration of a Li atom (green ball) obliquely hitting (a) the center and (b) off-center of a six- or five-membered ring (cross sections of the electron distribution are drawn in orange). Due to the repulsive interaction, the encapsulation area is shifted rightwards (x > 0) from the center of the ring. 
All these results of production ratio are summarized in Table 4. In a C60 molecule, there are 20 six-membered rings, 12 five-membered rings, 60 double bonds, and 30 single bonds. Taking a weighted average of these ratios, we compute the net production ratio for a Li atom impinging on a randomly oriented C60 with Ekinetic = 30 eV to be about 3.6% (3.2% for 40 eV if we ignore the large deformation of C60 just after the bombardment) as written in Table 4. When Li+ hits randomly oriented neutral C60, the production ratio becomes 3.7% for 30 eV and 3.3% for 40 eV. The resulting production ratios in the case of random orientation have an error of evaluation, because they were determined from the data of the well defined angles 0°, 21°, 32°, 38°, and 42° only. We evaluated just the weighted average of the production ratios of several different orientations. This procedure corresponds to assuming the linear interpolation with respect to the angles. Therefore, there is obviously an error in evaluation, which needs to be clarified. In order to estimate the accuracy of this assumption, we newly performed many different first-principles molecular dynamics simulations of intermediate impingement angles 10.5° and 29.5° for 10 eV, 20 eV, 30 eV, and 40 eV for both a hexagon and pentagon as listed in the tables in the ESI.† To check the accuracy of our weighted average scheme (linear interpolation), we utilized the neural network algorithm of machine learning for the impingement scenarios. We used all 582 results for the well defined angles (0°, 21°, 32°, 38°, and 42°) as the training data for machine learning. There are four input data: angle (°), distance x (Å), kinetic energy (eV), and hexagon/pentagon. There are two output data: encapsulated and not encapsulated. All 239 results for the intermediate angles 10.5° and 29.5° were used for the test data. That is, we used the neural network to estimate the predictive value (hitting ratio) for these intermediate angles 10.5° and 29.5°. The resulting predictive value was 85%, which confirms the accuracy of the simple linear interpolation method. The maximum production ratio of 3.7 ± 0.5% at 30 eV is certainly consistent with our experimental value ∼4%.

Although we performed microcanonical simulations, the impact energy will be dissipated to surrounding C60 molecules by vibrational effects over a longer time period. This can be treated as a thermal effect for the time scale longer than the time period of C60 lattice vibrations, which is typically 1 ps. However, this thermal dissipation generally corresponds to an annealing process, which cannot significantly heat up undamaged C60 to cause destruction. That is, C60 without damage or expansion cannot merge with adjacent C60. A more important process is the fusion of C60 molecules within a short time period (simulation time scale) of typically 200–300 fs. That is, the C60 molecules largely expanded by the attack of Li/Li+ will be fused with the adjacent C60 molecules in this time period. These are the cases written as “D”. Therefore, the results of our present simulations are sufficient to estimate roughly the percentage of the polymerization of C60. In this sense, the production ratio that we presented in our manuscript is not an overestimation but the correct estimation. From an experimental point of view, we have not measured the correct temperature of the sample during the plasma shower experiment. The only thing we can comment on, currently, is that at least there is no temperature increase in the chamber. We are now planning to perform a precise measurement of the sample temperature using a new machine that we are now constructing at Tohoku University/Idea International.
Upon reducing the kinetic energy of the ion to 10 eV, encapsulation does not occur in tilted C60 molecules. Therefore, from the same procedure of weighted average, the ratio is ascertained to be ∼0.2%, nearly 18 times the reduction. However, if C60 molecules are adsorbed on a Cu(111) surface42,43 or irradiated by UV light to form bonds with (2 + 2) cycloadditional four-membered rings44 so as to fix a six-membered ring atop, there is a great chance to increase the production ratio by multiple hits of Li+ ions with the 10 eV kinetic energy. This is because there is no damage on C60 even if Li is not successfully encapsulated in this case.
We tried an experiment using the monolayer C60 adsorbed on the Cu(111) surface. Using the STM measurement, we confirmed that six membered rings of C60 molecules are oriented atop. Then, the C60 adsorbed Cu(111) sample was set with −10 V bias voltage and Li+ ions were irradiated using the plasma shower method. However, this preliminary experiment was not so successful, because, although 1.3% of Li+ might be successfully encapsulated at the first bombardment as expected from our simulation, the rest of the Li+ rebounded backward with ∼5 eV kinetic energy by transferring some part of the initial kinetic energy to C60. Due to the electric field in the sheath region (∼5 mm width from the C60/Cu(111) sample), the rebounded Li+ accelerated toward the sample again, but the acquired kinetic energy was only ∼5 eV at the second bombardment because of the law of conservation of energy in the conservative (electric) force field. This energy is not enough for encapsulation. In order to implement multiple hits with 10 eV, some new method such as applying an alternating bias voltage is required. This is an experimental challenge to be tried with big efforts in the near future.
6. Conclusion
The results of our extensive first-principles molecular dynamics simulations that the maximum production ratio of Li+@C60 per hit is 3.7 ± 0.5% when a Li+ ion impinges a randomly oriented C60 molecule with 30 eV kinetic energy are fully consistent with the result of our 7Li solid NMR spectroscopy measurement that the maximum production ratio of Li+@C60 is ∼4% when Li+ ions attack randomly oriented C60 molecules with 30 V bias voltage. When a Li atom impinges a randomly oriented C60 molecule, the maximum production ratio of Li@C60 per hit is slightly lower and 3.6%; the most efficient kinetic energy is the same 30 eV. This difference comes from the fact that encapsulation through the five-membered ring is somewhat affected by the electron transfer from a neutral Li atom to neutral C60 just before the impingement. There is no difference in encapsulation through the six-membered ring by electron transfer, because the electron transfer mainly occurs to the five-membered rings only. When the incident kinetic energy is less than 30 eV, the encapsulation becomes harder, although Li/Li+ can be encapsulated through the center of a six-membered ring of C60 by a vertical attack at Ekinetic ≥ 8 eV. The theoretically estimated encapsulation ratio when a Li+ ion (or a Li atom) with 10 eV kinetic energy vertically hits a C60 molecule oriented with a six-membered ring atop is 1.3%. In this case, there is no damage on C60 even if Li is not successfully encapsulated. Therefore, there is a great chance to increase the production ratio using a repeated attack of Li with 10 eV kinetic energy onto, for example, monolayer C60 adsorbed on a Cu(111) surface or multilayer C60 irradiated by UV light. On the other hand, if the kinetic energy becomes greater than 40 eV, the probability that Li/Li+ goes through the whole C60 or breaks the C60 increases, and the production ratio decreases.

Our previous study3 ignored the spin polarization in the exchange–correlation47 and used a steepest descent method instead of a full matrix diagonalization (Householder) method. Moreover, the present version14,45,46 of TOMBO is much more accurate than the previous one.3.

 	Fig. 2  Snapshots of the simulation, when Li vertically collides at (0.3,0) Å of a six-membered ring at 0° with an initial kinetic energy of 10 eV (no. 3 of Table 1). It attacks near a double bond between the carbon atoms, and is bounced to the other side of the six-membered ring before being finally encapsulated in C60. The direction of view is along the x-axis.	 

 	Fig. 3  Snapshots of the simulation, when Li collides at (0.5,0) Å of a six-membered ring at 0° with an initial kinetic energy of 10 eV (no. 4 in Table 1). It attacks near the center of a double bond and moves to the other side of the six-membered ring before being bounced off the surface of C60. The direction of view is shown.	 

 	Fig. 4  Snapshots of the simulation when Li+ vertically collides at (0,0) of a six-membered ring with an initial kinetic energy of 30 eV (no. 6 of Table 1). It passes through C60 without distorting the structure. The direction of viewing is along the x-axis.	 

 	Fig. 5  Snapshots of the simulation when Li collides at (0.8,0) Å of a six-membered ring at a tilt angle of 36° with respect to the vertical plane of the molecule with an initial kinetic energy of 30 eV (no. 22 in Table 1). It attacks near the center of a single bond and is pushed into the cage. After encapsulation, it bounces repeatedly in C60. The direction of viewing is shown.	 

 	Fig. 6  Snapshots of the simulation when Li vertically collides at (0,3.0) Å of a six-membered ring with an initial kinetic energy of 30 eV (no. 29 of Table 1). It attacks carbon atoms directly below it and as a result bounces off the surface of C60 (t = 10–30 fs). Then, the two carbon atoms hit by the Li atom get encapsulated in C60. In this process, the carbon atoms that are colored orange form a seven-membered ring (t = 74.5 to 309.5 fs), thereby closing the cage structure. During the encapsulation of the two carbon atoms, the entire cage rotates around its axis as reflected by the change in the position of the seven-membered ring. The direction of viewing is along the x-axis.	 

 	Fig. 7  Snapshots of the simulation, when Li collides at (0.3,0) Å of a five-membered ring at a tilt angle of 21° with respect to the vertical plane of the molecule with an initial kinetic energy of 30 eV (no. 36 in Table 2). It attacks near the center of a single bond and penetrates into the cage. After encapsulation, it bounces repeatedly in C60. The direction of view is shown.	 

 	Fig. 8  The time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectra of the multilayer C60 samples irradiated by Li+ with (a) −6 V, (b) −10 V, and (c) −30 V bias voltages.	 

 	Fig. 9  
7Li solid NMR spectra obtained by the Li+ attack accelerated with a bias voltage of −30 V onto C60 multilayers; the main peak indicates the soft exohedral Li adsorptions and the side peak indicates Li+@C60.	 

 	Fig. 10  Illustration of a Li atom (green ball) obliquely hitting (a) the center and (b) off-center of a six- or five-membered ring (cross sections of the electron distribution are drawn in orange). Due to the repulsive interaction, the encapsulation area is shifted rightwards (x > 0) from the center of the ring.
