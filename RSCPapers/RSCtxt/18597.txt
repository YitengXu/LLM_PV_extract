    , Accepted 18th April 2017First published on 20th April 2017AbstractThe inability to utilize near infrared (NIR) light has posed a stringent limitation for the efficiencies of most single-junction photovoltaic cells such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Here, we describe a strategy to alleviate the NIR light harvesting problem by upconverting non-responsive NIR light in a broad spectral range (over 190 nm, 670–860 nm) to narrow solar-cell-responsive visible emissions through incorporated dye-sensitized upconversion nanoparticles (DSUCNPs). Unlike typically reported UCNPs with narrow and low NIR absorption, the organic dyes (IR783) anchored on the DSUCNP surface were able to harvest NIR photons broadly and efficiently, and then transfer the harvested energy to the inorganic UCNPs (typically reported), entailing an efficient visible upconversion. We show that the incorporation of DSUCNPs into the TiO2 photoanode of a DSSC is able to elevate its efficiency from 7.573% to 8.568%, enhancing the power conversion efficiency by about 13.1%. We quantified that among the relative efficiency increase, 7.1% arose from the contribution of broad-band upconversion in DSUCNPs (about ∼3.4 times higher than the highest previously reported value of ∼2.1%), and 6.0% mainly from the scattering effect of DSUCNPs. Our strategy has immediate implications for the use of DSUCNPs to improve the performance of other types of photovoltaic devices.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been deemed a promising alternative to the classic, single-junction, silicon-based solar cells for conversion of clean sunlight energy into electricity,1–8 because of the low manufacturing cost and high energy conversion efficiency. The maximum energy conversion efficiency of a DSSC can theoretically reach ∼30%;9 however, the reported highest experimental efficiency is about 12%. This difference is principally caused by the inability to utilize infrared (IR) photons that constitute almost half of the solar energy reaching the Earth surface, i.e., the transmission losses.10–13 To solve this issue, extensive efforts have been focused on the development of near IR (NIR)-responsive photosensitizers for panchromatic DSSCs,14–17 but hampered by the poor electron injection efficiency and high charge recombination rate. Photon upconversion provides an alternative approach to address this transmission loss by converting unutilized sub-bandgap NIR photons into useful above-bandgap visible photons.18–33 It has been shown for a solar cell of 1.7 eV bandgap that is close to typically used DSSCs, the Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit can be boosted from 28.2% to as high as 43.6% using upconverters with a narrow absorption bandwidth of ∼0.5 eV.34 Along this line, several efforts have been attempted using inorganic rare-earth-doped upconversion materials placed as a rear reflector layer,35 or to form an upconversion-TiO2 nanocomposite,36,37 or as internal layers in DSSCs.38–41 Although the NIR response has been demonstrated in a compelling way, the overall efficiency and increase of those solar cells remain limited. This is because the upconversion materials utilized are only able to harvest NIR light with a narrow absorption width (10–20 nm) at around ∼980 or 785 nm and with a low light absorption cross section (∼10–20 cm2) and a relatively low quantum yield (<1%).42 Indeed, the absorption spectral range is ∼10 times narrower, while the absorption cross section is ∼1000–10000 times lower than that of organic dyes.43,44 This fundamental limit of inorganic rare-earth upconversion materials, associated with the instinct 4f–4f electronic transitions of the doped rare earth ions, prevents their use to make pronounced contribution to the efficiency increase in DSSCs. Toward this, a seminal work was reported on the use of an NIR dye to sensitize Yb3+/Er3+ codoped NaYF4 UCNPs in which excitation through absorption of the dye was realized,45 and this concept was later successfully extended to the core/shell (NaYbF4:Tm)/NaYF4:Nd UCNPs with efficient energy cascaded upconversion.46 Yet, the application of dye-sensitized upconversion nanoparticles (DSUCNPs) for photovoltaics remains unexplored.
In this work, we report the use of IR783-sensitized NaYF4:10%Yb,2%Er@NaYF4:30%Nd (core@shell) DSUCNPs, for the improvement of NIR light harvesting in a DSSC device. The organic dye molecules (IR783) attached to the UCNP surface are able to harvest NIR light in a broad range of 670–860 nm with a large molecular absorption cross section (∼10−17 cm2). The harvested photonic energy can then be efficiently transferred to the Nd3+ ions incorporated into the inorganic shell, which subsequently sensitize the Yb3+/Er3+ ion pairs in the inorganic core to generate strong UC emission that can be utilized by the N719 dye in DSSCs. We showed that the described DSUCNPs can result in a 13.1% improvement over the overall DSSC efficiency, reaching a power conversion efficiency as high as ∼8.6%.

Fig. 1 illustrates the working principle for the use of IR783-sensitized NaYF4:10%Yb,2%Er@NaYF4:30%Nd DSUCNPs to produce broadband NIR light harvesting and then spectral conversion into useful narrow visible light for the improvement of a DSSC device. The left part of Fig. 1 portrays the configuration of a DSSC structure where DSUCNPs are placed on top of the mesoporous TiO2 layer. The light-absorbing dyes (N719) in regular DSSC devices (without involving DSUCNPs) is only able to harvest ultraviolet–visible spectral range (350–670 nm) of standard AM1.5 sunlight, with radically reduced absorption capability at the edge of longer wavelength absorption (the right part of Fig. 1). An introduction of IR783-sensitized core@shell DSUCNPs into the DSSC device enables capturing NIR photons in a new spectral range of 670–860 nm (due to the absorption of IR783 dye, the red filled curve on the right of Fig. 1), and then the absorbed NIR photons following an energy transfer process, i.e., surface dye → Nd (shell) → Yb/Er (core) (the middle of Fig. 1), can be upconverted to 540/650 nm luminescence that matches the absorption spectrum of the N719 dye. In this way, the harvested NIR energy is upconverted to activate the N719 dye to produce charge carriers, improving the photovoltaic performance of a DSSC device.

Regarding the designated IR783-sensitized NaYF4:10%Yb,2%Er@NaYF4:30%Nd DSUCNPs, the involved hexagonal inorganic core@shell NaYF4:10%Yb,2%Er@NaYF4:30%Nd nanocrystals were synthesized by a high temperature co-precipitation method with experimental details described in the ESI.† Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the formation of a uniform core/shell structure with an average total size of ∼38.5 nm and a shell thickness of 7 nm (ESI, Fig. S1†). The spatial isolation of the Yb3+/Er3+ dopants in the core from the Nd3+ ions in the shell layer prevents possible cross-relaxation between the Er3+ and Nd3+ ions, thus allowing higher UC luminescence (UCL).45 The UCL spectra, excited at 800 nm, from core@shell UCNPs with varied amounts of Nd3+ ions indicated that the optimal concentration for Nd3+ ions in the shell was ∼30% (ESI, Fig. S2†). To enact the antenna effect of IR783 dyes, they were introduced into the optimized core@shell UCNP dispersion. The overlapping between the PL spectrum of the IR783 dye and the absorption of the Nd3+ ion suggests a Förster-type energy transfer from the IR783 dye to the Nd3+ ions (ESI, Fig. S3†), which can then sensitize the Yb ion and then the Er ion in the core, producing strong UCL at 540 (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) and 650 nm (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) of Er.46–48 The morphology of UCNPs remains unchanged with dye sensitization (ESI, Fig. S4†). The IR783 dye was demonstrated to be photostable under AM1.5 G simulated sunlight irradiation (ESI, Fig. S5†). It was found that the UCL of IR783-sensitized core@shell DSUCNPs exhibited a strong dependence on the concentration of the IR783 dye. The optimized dye concentration was determined to be ∼36.7 μg mL−1, resulting in a ∼9 fold UCL intensity enhancement (Fig. 2a). The number of IR783 dyes per NaYF4:10%Yb,2%Er@NaYF4:30%Nd core/shell nanoparticle was determined to be ∼620 (see the ESI†). The great intensity enhancement can also be substantiated by photographic images of UCL from the only core@shell NPs and the IR783-sensitized core@shell DSUCNPs in Fig. 2b. The effect of the IR783 dye on the absorption of core@shell NPs and DSSC device was also investigated and is shown in Fig. 2c.

(b) Photographic UCL images of colloidal core@shell UCNPs and IR783-sensitized core@shell DSUCNPs with the optimized IR783 concentration. (c) Contrasted absorption spectra of the core@shell UCNPs (black line), IR783-sensitized core@shell DSUCNPs (blue line), and TiO2 photoanode with N719 treated with IR783-sensitized core@shell DSUCNPs (red line). (d) The emission intensity of the green and red UCL bands of IR783-sensitized core@shell DSUCNPs before and after depositing onto the surface of TiO2 photoanode with N719. 
As one can see, as compared to the weak and narrow absorption of the core@shell UCNPs (black line, without IR783 sensitization), the introduction of IR783 dye molecules to the surface of core@shell UCNPs could significantly increase and broaden the absorption (670–860 nm, blue line), thus enhancing the NIR-absorbing ability by ∼12 fold. As expected, when incorporating IR783-sensitized core@shell DSUCNPs into the N719-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, the absorption of the photoanode was successfully extended to the NIR range (670–860 nm), along with two bands located at 350–470 and 470–600 nm originating from the N719 dye (dotted and connected red line, Fig. 2c). Moreover, the energy transfer between the DSUCNPs and the photosensitizer N719 in the photoanode was also confirmed by the UCL spectra of TiO2 photoanodes treated by DSUCNPs without and with N719 (Fig. 2d, and ESI Fig. S6†). The green UCL band (525/540 nm) from DSUCNPs was decreased about 7 times by the presence of N719 dye, corresponding to ∼87.5% energy transfer efficiency (Fig. 2d). Instead, limited energy transfer from the red UCL band to the N719 dye was observed (Fig. 2d), being ascribed to the low absorption of N719 dye at 650 nm (see Fig. 1). Taken together, these results indicate that the DSUCNPs are able to broadly absorb NIR light, and then convert into visible upconversion to efficiently activate the N719 dye, thus enabling broadband-NIR-responsive DSSCs (ESI, Fig. S7†).
To investigate the influence of DSUCNPs on DSSCs, we prepared three DSSCs, one is based on core@shell UCNPs (without IR783 sensitization, control cell), the second one is a regular DSSC (without both IR783 dye and core@shell UCNPs, control cell), and the third one is based on IR783 dye-sensitized core@shell DSUCNPs. The cell preparation process is schematically shown in Fig. 3a. We confirmed that the UCNPs and the DSUCNPs had been successfully deposited into the TiO2 photoanode, as can be seen by the change of surface morphology due to the addition of DSUCNPs in FESEM images (Fig. 3b). This conclusion was further supported by the observation of a new signal of Na, Y, F, Yb, Er and Nd elements, along with Ti and O, in the DSUCNP (or UCNP) containing TiO2 layer by using an Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS, ESI, Fig. S8†), and by the appearance of a new NaYF4 crystal phase via X-ray diffraction (XRD, ESI, Fig. S9†). The thickness of the TiO2 electrode layer was determined to be ∼20.1 μm, and of the DSUCNP layer to be ∼4.6 μm (ESI, Fig. S10†). To demonstrate the NIR harvest function by UCNPs and DSUCNPs, the prepared three cells were tested under an 800 nm NIR laser with a power of 1 W (Fig. 3c). The J–V curve of the regular DSSC cell exhibited no photovoltaic response to NIR light (η of 0.062% can be ignored), while the core@shell UCNP-treated DSSC showed an obvious enhancement of DSSC performance, confirming that the core@shell UCNPs endow DSSC devices with NIR light harvesting ability. As expected, the IR783-sensitized core@shell DSUCNPs make the DSSC device have the maximally improved response to NIR photons, resulting in a Voc of 0.679 V, a Jsc of 1.062 mA cm−2, a FF of 77.1%, and an η of 0.556%.

(b) Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of the pure TiO2 photoanode, the TiO2 photoanode treated with core@shell UCNPs, and the TiO2 photoanode treated with IR783-sensitized core@shell DSUCNPs. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSSC, DSSC-UCNPs and DSSC-DSUCNPs under 800 nm NIR laser light J–V curves (c) and AM1.5 G simulated sunlight irradiation (100 mW cm−2) (d). 
We then investigated the photocurrent density–voltage curves (J–V) of these three cells under direct AM1.5 G simulated sunlight irradiation (100 mW cm−2), and the results are shown in Fig. 3d with photovoltaic parameters summarized in its inset. As can be seen, the control DSSC (without both IR783 and UCNPs) shows a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.731 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.769 V, FF = 0.626 and η = 7.573%. By replacing the photoanode with a TiO2 photoanode treated with core@shell UCNP solution, a Jsc of 16.683 mA cm−2 and η of 8.166% were produced, yielding a 7.8% efficiency enhancement over the regular N719 DSSC. As a control, we also prepared the NaYF4@NaYF4 NPs without any dopants and applied them to the TiO2 photoanode, achieving a Jsc of 16.547 mA cm−2 and η of 8.019% (ESI, Fig. S11†), thus generating a 5.9% efficiency enhancement. This result confirmed that the enhancement of conversion efficiency by core@shell UCNPs was predominantly due to the scattering effect, and the contribution to efficiency improvement by the UC process was merely about 1.9%. When the IR783 dye was introduced to sensitize core@shell NPs for broadband harvesting of NIR sunlight, the DSSC device reached an enhanced Jsc of 17.115 mA cm−2 and η of 8.568%, showing a 13.1% efficiency enhancement over the regular N719 DSSC cell. The importance of the coexistence of both IR783 and core@shell NPs to generate the dye-sensitized upconversion for DSSC performance improvement was supported by the J–V results of two more control experiments (ESI, Fig. S12 and S13†). The first one is on the comparison of the J–V curves of the pure IR783 treated DSSC cell and regular DSSC cell (ESI, Fig. S12†); it was found that the pure use of the IR783 dye could result in a dramatic decrease of cell efficiency. The decrease might be attributed to the detachment of the N719 dye from the TiO2 surface by the IR783 dye. The second control experiment was on the comparison of the J–V curves of the DSSC treated with IR783-sensitized core@shell DSUCNPs, and the DSSC cell treated with a mixture of IR783 and NaYF4@NaYF4 NPs (ESI, Fig. S13†); it was clearly shown that the presence of IR783-sensitized core@shell NPs, namely dye-sensitized upconversion, can result in improved performance of DSSC (cell efficiency 8.568%) over a mixture of IR783 and NaYF4@NaYF4 NPs without upconversion (cell efficiency 8.030%). This control experiment indicated that among the 13.1% efficiency enhancement induced by DSUCNPs, 7.1% arose from the upconversion contribution (about ∼3.4 times higher than the highest value reported in the literature39), while ∼6.0% from the scattering effect of DSUCNPs (in good agreement with the scattering result of inert NaYF4@NaYF4 NPs, see Fig. S11†). This is reasonable, as the IR783 dye has a small size as an organic molecule, and thus induces no or rather limited scattering effect. Taken together, these results reveal that the DSUCNP composite of core@shell NPs and IR783 dyes not only plays an important role in the enhancement of harvesting NIR sunlight, but also depresses the detachment of the N719 dyes. The optimal treatment time and concentration of DSUCNPs were investigated and determined to be about 20 min and 20 mg mL−1, respectively (ESI, Fig. S14 and S15†).
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was investigated to further analyze the origin of the better photovoltaic performance of the DSSC treated with IR783-sensitized core@shell DSUCNPs, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. Notably, the IR783-sensitized core@shell DSUCNP treatment results in the most obvious increase in IPCE values over a wide range of wavelengths (300–750 nm) at one sun, being mainly ascribed to the scattering effect of DSUCNPs. However, it should be noted that the IPCE difference between the UCNP-treated and DSUCNP-treated cells at the spectral range of 300–750 nm remains unclear and needs further investigations, but possibly associated with the IR783-induced effects. More interestingly, the DSUCNP treated DSSC system showed an improved broad-band NIR response at ∼800 nm (760–830 nm), clearly corresponding to the absorption of IR783. Furthermore, the DSUCNP-treated cell showed broader and higher IPCE values than that from the UCNP-treated cell, due to higher and broader upconversion of DSUCNPs than UCNPs.

Conclusions
In summary, IR783-sensitized core@shell DSUCNPs have been utilized to enhance the NIR harvest of DSSC devices for the first time. At the optimal treatment time of 20 min and treatment concentration of 20 mg ml−1 for DSUCNPs, the solar cell efficiency was increased from 7.573% to 8.568%, which showed a 13.1% enhancement compared to the control cell (regular cell) without DSUCNPs. Furthermore, the upconversion contribution from harvesting NIR sunlight was quantified to be 7.1%, along with the scattering contribution of ∼6%. The upconversion contribution was significantly higher than that induced by bare core@shell UCNPs (1.9%) due to much more efficient upconversion of DSUCNPs than UCNPs and in a broad NIR spectral range (670–860 nm). Our strategy provides a facile and generic way to enable the most efficient harvesting of NIR sunlight for dye-sensitized and other types of solar cells.
