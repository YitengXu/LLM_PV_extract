    , Accepted 31st August 2013First published on 3rd September 2013AbstractTwo donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers (PBDTBT and PBDTBSe) based on bithienyl-benzodithiophene (BDT) as the donor (D) unit, fluorinated benzothiadiazole (BT) or benzoselenadiazole (BSe) as the acceptor (A) unit, were designed and synthesized. The optoelectronic properties of the two polymers, including the absorption spectra, electronic energy levels, hole mobility and photovoltaic properties, were fully studied and compared. The effects of the replacement of S by Se in the BT unit and F substitution on their optoelectronic properties were investigated in detail. The replacement of S by Se in the benzothiadiazole unit red-shifted the absorption spectra and increased the hole mobility of the D–A copolymers. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on the polymers as the donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) as the acceptor were fabricated, and the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs was optimized by optimizing the device fabrication conditions, including the solvent, donor–acceptor blend ratio, thermal annealing and solvent additive. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the optimized PSCs based on the polymers reached 5.06% and 2.20% for PBDTBT and PBDTBSe, respectively. The lower photovoltaic performance of the PSCs based on PBDTBSe is due to the poorer morphology of its active layer.
Introduction
Conjugated polymers have attracted great attention in the past three decades for their novel optoelectronic properties and applications in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs) etc. The most important properties of the conjugated polymers include absorption and photoluminescent spectra, the energy bandgap, electronic energy levels and charge carrier mobility. In particular, broad absorption with a lower bandgap, higher hole mobility and relatively lower HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy levels are pursued for the application of conjugated polymers as donors in PSCs,1 because broad absorption and a higher hole mobility of the polymer donor lead to a larger short circuit current (Jsc),1c and a lower HOMO energy level of the polymer donor will result in a larger open circuit voltage (Voc) of the PSCs.2
The D–A copolymerization of the donor (D) and acceptor (A) units is a popular and successful strategy in reducing the bandgap and decreasing the HOMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers.3,4 The D–A approach allows facile tuning of the frontier molecular orbital energies (HOMO and LUMO) and bandgaps by intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from a donor unit to an acceptor moiety within the repeat unit of the copolymers. In the D–A copolymers, the incorporation of an electron-withdrawing fluorine atom onto the periphery of the acceptor unit is attractive, since its small size is expected to minimize any undesired steric interactions, and also its strong electron affinity is expected to decrease the HOMO and LUMO energy levels.5 Furthermore, fluorination can decrease the bandgap of the polymer films in some cases, which arises from the improvement in the planarization of the conjugated backbone and F atom-induced intramolecular and/or intermolecular interactions.6 Indeed, the direct incorporation of fluorine onto the periphery of electron-deficient benzothiadiazole (BT),6b,7 benzotriazole8 and quinoxaline9 units has recently been shown to increase the photovoltaic performance of some (but not all) donor polymers, mainly through an increase in the Voc.
The replacement of sulfur (S) with selenium (Se) within aromatic rings in conjugated polymers tends to induce a red shift in the absorption spectrum. This is because the Se atom is much larger in size and less electronegative compared with the S atom, and thus Se-containing polymers are expected to be more effective in extending the absorption spectrum toward the infrared region. In addition, the Se-containing unit is more polarizable than the S analogue; thus, the interchain Se⋯Se interactions could improve the charge mobility of the polymers. Recently, it has been found that replacing S with Se in the thiophene π-bridge in diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-containing conjugated polymers (SeDPP-based polymers) can decrease the bandgap and enhance the charge transport properties in organic field effect transistor devices.10 However, the photovoltaic performance of the SeDPP-based low bandgap polymer was lower than its corresponding polymer with a thiophene π-bridge, mostly due to its higher HOMO level and thus the lower Voc of the photovoltaic device.10d Similarly, recent efforts to replace the sulfur atom in thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) with selenium to form the electron-deficient seleno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (SePD), which narrowed the bandgap of the resulting polymer, but reduced the Voc significantly and featured a lower PCE.11 Another developed Se-containing electron-deficient building block is benzoselenadiazole (BSe), which is a benzothiadiazole (BT) analogue, where S is replaced by Se.12 BSe-based polymers have been used in PSCs and gave an unsatisfactory PCE of 2.5%.12d On the other hand, very recently Tajima et al. reported a BSe-based low bandgap polymer with a promising PCE up to 5.18%, which was slightly higher than that of the BT-based analog (5.01%).13 The above contradictory results show that there is a need to develop a novel Se-based electron-deficient unit to build D–A type copolymers, and compare the properties of the resulting S- and Se-based copolymers for a more clear understanding of the effects of Se substitution.
In this study, we chose benzodithiophene (BDT) as the electron-rich unit and fluorinated BT or BSe as the electron-deficient unit to synthesize two new D–A copolymers (PBDTBT and PBDTBSe, see Fig. 1). The aim of the design of these polymers is to investigate the effects of Se substitution on the optoelectronic properties by comparing BT and BSe-based D–A type copolymers. BDT was employed as the electron-rich donor unit because of its rigidity, coplanarity by fusing benzene with two flanking thiophene units, high hole mobility, extended π-conjugated structure, and easy side chain modification for tuning the solubility.14 Some BDT-containing copolymers have shown great potential in PSCs with enhanced mobilities and high PCEs surpassing 7%.6b,15 Here, we attached alkylthienyl groups to the 4 and 8 positions of the BDT unit to afford a two-dimensional (2D)-conjugated BDT featuring more electron-rich donor groups and extended conjugation, which is expected to result in red-shifted absorption spectra, lower HOMO energy levels and a higher hole mobility.7a,15c On the other hand, the introduction of F atoms with high electron affinity to the BT and BSe moieties is designed to further lower both the HOMO and LUMO levels of the resulting polymers. The basic properties of the two polymers, such as their absorption spectra, energy levels, hole mobility in the films, and photovoltaic performance, were fully studied and compared. The effects of Se and F substitution on these properties was investigated in detail.

Experimental section
Measurements and characterization

1H NMR spectra and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker DMX-400 spectrometer with chloroform as the solvent and trimethylsilane as the internal reference. UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were measured on a Hitachi U-3010 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Mass spectrometry (MS) was performed on a Shimadzu spectrometer, and MALDI-TOF-MS spectra were determined on a Bruker BIFLEX III mass spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 thermogravimetric analyzer at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 and under a nitrogen flow rate of 100 mL min−1. The molecular weights of the polymers were measured by the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) method on a Waters 515-2410 instrument with polystyrenes as the standard and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a Zahner IM6e Electrochemical Workstation, with a Pt disk coated with the polymer film, Pt wire and Ag/AgCl as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode respectively, in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6)–acetonitrile solution. The morphology of the blend films was measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM, Digital Instrument Multimode Nanoscope IIIA) in the tapping mode.
PSC device fabrication and characterization
The PSC devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al, where the active layer is composed of a conjugated polymer as the donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) as the acceptor. The patterned ITO glass was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol and treated in an ultraviolet–ozone chamber (Jelight Co.) for 30 min. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)) was spin-cast on pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass from a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Baytron P VP AI 4083 from H. C. Starck) at 3000 rpm and subsequently dried at 150 °C for 30 min in air. Then the device was transferred to a glovebox, where a blend solution of the polymer and fullerene derivative (PC70BM) was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The concentration of the polymer/PC70BM blend solutions used in this work for the spin-coating active layer was 10 mg mL−1 (based on the polymer weight concentration), and chlorobenzene (CB) or o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) was used as the solvent, and a small amount of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used as an additive to improve the photovoltaic performance of the devices if necessary. Then, a pre-thermal annealing treatment was performed if necessary. Beside this, no further treatment to the blend film was performed before the deposition of the metal electrode. Finally, a Ca/Al metal top electrode was deposited under vacuum onto the active layer at a pressure of ca. 5 × 10−5 Pa. The active area of the device was ca. 4 mm2. The thickness of the active layer was controlled by changing the spin speed during the spin-coating process and was measured on an Ambios Tech. XP-2 profilometer. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source-Measure Unit. A xenon lamp (150 W) coupled with an AM 1.5 solar spectrum filter was used as the light source, and the optical power was 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves were measured by a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 150 W xenon lamp. The hole mobility was calculated by fitting the dark J–V curves for the hole-only devices to the SCLC model at low voltages, in which the current density is given by J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3 exp[0.891γ(V/L)0.5], where ε0εr represents the permittivity of the material, μ is the mobility, γ is the field activation factor and L the thickness of the active layer. The applied bias voltage is corrected for the built-in potential so that V = Vapplied − Vbi.

Synthesis of the copolymer PBDTBT

M1 (179.5 mg, 0.25 mmol) and M3 (226.4 mg, 0.25 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of dry toluene, and the solution was flushed with argon for 15 min, after which 15 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added into the solution. The mixture was again flushed with argon for 30 min. The polymerization was carried out at 120 °C for 36 h. Finally, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and slowly added to methanol (150 mL).

Results and discussion
Material synthesis
The synthetic routes of the monomers and the corresponding D–A copolymers are outlined in Scheme 1. Starting from 4,5-difluoro-1,2-benzenediamine, fluorinated BT6b (1a) and BSe12b (1b) were synthesized according to the reported procedures. To ensure sufficient solubility of the resulting copolymers, branched alkyl chains (2-ethylhexyl) were anchored on the fluorinated monomers M1 and M2 and the BDT-containing monomer M3. As a result, the final copolymers are soluble in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran (THF), CB and DCB. The copolymers were synthesized by a Stille coupling reaction between the dibromide monomers (M1 and M2) and the bis(trimethyltin) BDT monomer M3 using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst in good yields (∼70%). The crude copolymers were purified by successive extraction with methanol, hexane and chloroform. The chloroform solution was concentrated and the product re-precipitated in methanol to obtain the resulting copolymers. Table 1 summarizes the polymerization results and the thermal properties of the copolymers. The molecular weights and polydispersity indices (PDIs) of the copolymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with a polystyrene standard calibration and THF as the eluent. The two copolymers had relatively high weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of 31.7 and 39.4 kDa with moderate PDIs of 1.83 and 1.58 for PBDTBT and PBDTBSe, respectively (Table 1). It should be noted that the two polymers have similar molecular weights, which can eliminate any possible impact of different molecular weights on the optoelectronic properties of the polymers.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were employed to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymers. The TGA analysis reveals that the onset temperatures with 5% weight loss (Td) of the two polymers are above 370 °C (Fig. 2, Table 1), indicating that these 2D conjugated polymers based on alkylthienyl-substituted BDT possess good thermal stability. This result agrees with other BDT-based polymers with conjugated alkylthienyl side chains.7a,15c Additionally, it is clear that BT-containing polymer (PBDTBT) showed better thermal stability compared to the corresponding BSe-containing polymer (PBDTBSe).

Optical properties
The optical properties of the two polymers were investigated by UV-vis absorption in dilute chloroform solution and as thin solid films (Fig. 3). The detailed absorption data, including the absorption maximum wavelength (λmax) in both solution and films, the absorption edge (onset wavelength of the absorption peak, λedge) of the polymer films and optical bandgaps (Eoptg), are summarized in Table 2.

As shown in Fig. 3, the two polymers show similar broad absorption spectral features across the entire UV-vis region, both in chloroform solution and as solid films. It should be noted that the polymers show one additional high-energy band in addition to the apparent characteristic D–A dual-band.16 One high-energy peak located at approximately 350 nm can be assigned to the conjugated thiophene side chains. The other high-energy band at around 430 nm and the low-energy band located at about 580 nm correspond to the characteristic dual-band of the D–A system, which are attributed to localized π–π* transitions in the polymeric backbone and the ICT between the BDT donor and the BT or BSe acceptor moieties, respectively. The absorptions of the polymer films are broader and only a little red-shifted compared with that in solution (Fig. 3), which reveals that strong aggregation exists in solution for the fluorinated polymers.6b,8b In addition, these types of fluorinated polymer exhibit an additional absorption shoulder in solution and as thin films, implying additional polymer-chain stacking both in solution and in the solid state.6b,15 Such broad absorption and ordered packing of the polymer chains could result in a larger Jsc and charge carrier mobility. Furthermore, compared to PBDTBT, the absorption peaks of the BSe-based copolymer PBDTBSe is red-shifted by about 10 nm in the high-energy band and 30 nm in the low-energy band (Table 2). The more obvious red-shift in the low-energy band relative to the high-energy band indicates that heavy atom (Se) substitution can lead to a remarkable red-shift in the low-energy transition, while the high-energy band remains relatively constant in energy.17 The red-shift in the low-energy transition will result in a decrease of the bandgap value. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of PBDTBT and PBDTBSe are 1.74 and 1.66 eV, respectively, calculated from the absorption edges (λedge) of the solid state films (Table 2). Obviously, the BSe-based polymer PBDTBSe features a lower bandgap than the BT-based polymer PBDTBT. These results clearly indicate that replacing a S atom with a Se atom is a simple and effective way of lowering the bandgaps and red-shifting the absorption spectra of BT-containing D–A type copolymers to the long-wavelength region.8b,13,17
Electrochemical properties
Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the redox behavior of the polymers and to estimate their HOMO and LUMO energy levels. Fig. 4 shows the cyclic voltammograms of the two polymer films on a Pt electrode in a 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6–acetonitrile solution. The results of the electrochemical properties are also summarized in Table 2.
 Fig. 4  Cyclic voltammograms of the polymer films on a platinum electrode in an acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The cyclic voltammogram of ferrocene is included in the figure for calibration of the redox potentials. 
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels (EHOMO/LUMO) of these polymers were measured by CV (Fig. 4). The CV curve was recorded by using a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference, which was calibrated against the redox potential of the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple (Fc/Fc+ measured as 0.39 V vs. Ag/AgCl), whose ionization energy was assumed to be 4.80 eV below the vacuum level.18 Thus, EHOMO/LUMO = −e(Eox/red + 4.41) (eV), where Eox/red is the oxidation/reduction onset potential of the sample vs. Ag/AgCl. Based on the onset values of the oxidation potentials (0.93 and 0.89 V) of the two polymers, the EHOMO values of PBDTBT and PBDTBSe were calculated to be −5.34 and −5.30 eV, respectively. Additionally, the ELUMO values were calculated from the onset values of the reduction potentials (−1.18 and −0.94 V), which are −3.23 eV for PBDTBT and −3.47 eV for PBDTBSe. The HOMO levels are analogous to those of BDT-based low bandgap polymers (−5.30 to −5.50 eV),14b which can be expected to achieve a high Voc in PSCs, according to the dependence of Voc on the difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the accepter.4 The conjugated thiophene side units attached to the BDT unit can slightly lower the HOMO levels of the polymers around the corresponding ideal energy level of −5.40 eV.19 It is interesting to note that the electron-deficient fluorine groups substantially lowered the HOMO energy levels. Compared with the BT- and BSe-based analogue polymers,13 lower HOMO energy levels down-shifted by ca. 0.08 eV and 0.12 eV were achieved for PBDTBT and PBDTBSe respectively, which indicates that fluorinated PBDTBT and PBDTBSe could be promising photovoltaic materials with a high Voc. These results agree well with the previous reports by You that the incorporation of fluorine is effective in decreasing the HOMO energy levels.6b,8a Moreover, the lower-lying HOMO of PBDTBT compared with PBDTBSe is expected to increase the Voc of PSCs. The electrochemical bandgaps were also calculated to be 2.11 and 1.83 eV for PBDTBT and PBDTBSe, respectively, which were greater than Eoptg (Table 2) but within the range of error (0.2–0.5 eV).20
Photovoltaic properties
PSCs were fabricated from the two polymers as the donor and PC70BM as the acceptor, with a general device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM/Ca/Al. The active layers were spin-coated from a chlorobenzene (CB) or o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) solution of the donor and acceptor. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) was used as a processing additive to optimize the morphology, and pre-thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min was performed before the deposition of the metal top electrode in some devices. The corresponding Voc, Jsc, fill factor (FF), and PCE of the devices are summarized in Tables 3–5. Fig. 5 shows some current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs based on the polymer:PC70BM blends under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2.

 Fig. 5  Typical J–V characteristics of photovoltaic devices based on (a) PBDTBT with different solvents and donor/acceptor ratios, (b) PBDTBSe with different fabricated conditions, and (c) PBDTBT with DIO as a processing additive. 
First, we found that the different processing solvents (CB versus DCB) has some effect on the photovoltaic properties of the devices based on the two polymers. As shown in Table 3, the devices (D3, D4, D9, D10) with DCB as the processing solvent showed higher PCEs than those of the corresponding devices using CB as the solvent (D1, D2, D7, D8) under the same fabrication conditions, which is mainly attributed to the increase of the FF and Jsc to some extent. Then the blend ratio of the polymer donor and PC70BM acceptor was optimized (D3–6 and D9–10). As the mixing ratio of PBDTBT and PC70BM increased from 1:1 to 1:2, the PCE of the device increased from 3.55% for D3 with a D–A weight ratio of 1:1 to 3.93% for D4 with a weight ratio of 1:2 (Fig. 5a, Table 3). When the weight ratio was increased further, the PCEs dropped sharply (e.g. PCE of D6 with a weight ratio of 1:4 dropped to 1.50%). The main reason for this is the decrease of both the Voc and Jsc of the PSCs. Therefore, the optimal blend ratio for this polymer was determined to be around 1:2. However for the PBDTBSe-based PSCs, the optimal blend ratio appears to be 1:1, because the PSCs with a weight ratio of 1:1 (D7 and D9) exhibited higher PCEs than the devices with a weight ratio of 1:2 (D8 and D10). A noteworthy fact is that the devices based on these fluorinated polymers show a significant improvement (∼0.2 V) in the Voc relative to those of the non-fluorinated analogues.13 Most of the PSCs based on the two polymers gave Voc values higher than 0.8 V, and some of them even exceed 0.9 V (D1, D3, D4, D11, and D15). As discussed in the “Electrochemical properties” section, the electron-withdrawing nature of F lowers the HOMO energy levels of the fluorinated polymers compared to those of the non-fluorinated analogues.13 Since the Voc is largely determined by the difference between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of PCBM, the reduction of the polymer HOMO energy level largely accounts for the increase in Voc after the F substitution.
Thermal treatment has proved successful for controlling the nanomorphology of the active layers. Moreover, use of an appropriate temperature and time of thermal annealing plays a key role in optimizing the morphology and enhancing the performance of PSCs.22 Here we obtained optimal conditions of pre-thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min, and found some interesting results. From Table 4, one can see that the influence of pre-thermal annealing depends on the processing solvent and the blend ratio of the donor and acceptor. For PBDTBT-based devices, when the blend ratio was 1:1, device D11 with CB as the solvent gave an improved PCE of 3.81% compared to D1, whereas device D14 with DCB as the solvent showed a decreased PCE of 3.33% relative to D3. However, when the blend ratio was changed to 1:2, device D12 with CB as the solvent gave a decreased PCE of 2.97%, whereas device D15 with DCB as the solvent showed an increased PCE of 4.06%, which opposes the results observed in the blend ratio of 1:1. On the other hand, for the PBDTBSe-based devices, an improved PCE of 1.69% was achieved with a blend ratio of 1:1 and DCB as the solvent. The changing trend of the PCEs is mainly in accord with the changing tendencies of the Jsc and FF of the corresponding devices (Fig. 5b, Table 4).
Besides the thermal annealing treatment, the processing solvent additive, such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), also can affect the morphology of the active layer and the corresponding photovoltaic properties of the PSCs. As shown in Fig. 5c and Table 5, the processing additive DIO has a great influence on the PCEs of the PSCs based on the two polymers. When a small amount (3%, v/v) of DIO was added as the processing additive, the Jsc and FF can be improved significantly, resulting in improved PCEs even though the Voc dropped to some extent. A maximum PCE of 5.06% was achieved in the PSC (D20) based on PBDTBT, with Voc = 0.88 V, Jsc = 10.73 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.536. As for the PBDTBSe-based PSCs, a PCE of 2.08% (D23) was achieved when the blend ratio of PBDTBSe/PC70BM was 1:1 with 3% DIO as the additive. As the blend ratio is changed to 1:2, the PCE is further improved to 2.20% (D25) with Voc = 0.81 V, Jsc = 5.36 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.506. The improved efficiencies may originate from the increased absorption of light, enhanced charge carrier mobility, or the improved efficiency of charge carrier collection from the optimal morphology with DIO as the processing additive.
From the above results, it can be seen that there is a great difference in the photovoltaic performance between the two similar polymers. Obviously, the main reason is the substantial improvement in Voc and Jsc for the PBDTBT-based cells compared to PBDTBSe. For the PBDTBSe-based PSCs, the decreased Voc can be readily understood from its higher-lying HOMO energy level compared with that of PBDTBT (see Table 2). With regard to the reduced Jsc, the absorption properties should not be principally responsible, because the red-shifted absorption spectrum and the lower bandgap of PBDTBSe relative to PBDTBT should lead to a higher Jsc.

Fig. 6 displays the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the PSCs. For the PSCs based on the two polymers with different fabrication conditions, the shapes of the EQE curves are similar, but the EQE values of the devices with thermal annealing and the DIO additive are enhanced. The highest EQE values are 52% (at 495 nm) and 40% (at 515 nm) for the PSCs based on PBDTBT/PC70BM and PBDTBSe/PC70BM respectively. Although the EQE value is not very high, the response covers a reasonable broad spectral range from 300 to 750 nm and a relatively high EQE value above 40% at 350–650 nm, which explains the high Jsc values of the PBDTBT-based devices. For the PSCs based on PBDTBSe/PC70BM, the response extends to 750 nm, which is longer than that of the PBDTBT/PC70BM system by ca. 20 nm and consistent with its red-shifted absorption spectrum. The lower EQE values of the PBDTBSe-based devices agree with the lower Jsc values of the corresponding PSCs.

Hole mobility
In consideration of the influence of Se and F substitution on the charge-carrier mobilities of the resulting polymers and the relative effects of charge-carrier mobilities in the blend films on the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells, the hole mobilities of the pure polymers and blend films in the active layers (for polymer/PC70BM, 1:2) were measured by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method with the hole-only device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au.18 The hole mobility was calculated by fitting the dark J–V curves for the hole-only devices to the SCLC model at the higher voltages, in which the current density is given by J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3 exp[0.891γ(V/L)0.5]. Fig. 7 displays the ln(JL3V−2) versus (VL−1)0.5 curve for the measurement of the hole mobility of the copolymers. According to the above equation and the curves shown in Fig. 7, the calculated hole mobilities are 4.47 × 10−3 and 1.03 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the pure PBDTBT and PBDTBSe films, respectively. As for the blend films, the hole mobilities of PBDTBT and PBDTBSe are 1.01 × 10−4 and 1.11 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are an order of magnitude lower than the corresponding pure polymers. For both the pure polymer and the blend active layer, the hole mobility of PBDTBSe is an order higher than for PBDTBT, indicating that the replacement of S in the BT unit with Se is beneficial in enhancing the hole mobility of the D–A copolymers.23

Morphology characterization
In order to gain more insight into the observed difference in device performance (especially the Jsc) of the two polymers and investigate the effect of the thermal annealing and DIO additive on the photovoltaic properties, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to measure the morphological properties of the BHJ films. As shown in Fig. 8b and h, the polymer/PC70BM (1:2, w/w) blend films spin-coated from DCB solution show a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 5.82 and 6.55 nm in the topography for PBDTBT and PBDTBSe, respectively. It should be mentioned that the larger RMS value of the PBDTBSe-based blend film could be one reason for the lower photovoltaic performance of PBDTBSe, as it may lead to inefficient charge separation, decreasing the Jsc and the device efficiency. In addition, the hole mobilities of 4.47 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDTBT could already be high enough to balance its hole transportation with the electron transportation of PCBM, and the higher hole mobility of 1.03 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDTBSe may lead to hole accumulation at the anode/active layer interface which degrades the photovoltaic performance of PBDTBSe.

The scanned area is 5 × 5 μm2. 
When the blend film of the active layer based on PBDTBT/PC70BM was annealed at 110 °C for 10 min, or when DIO was used as an additive during the spin-coating process, the phase images (Fig. 8d and f) look very different to the films processed with pristine DCB (Fig. 8b). Regular fibril domains form in the phase images, and the surface becomes relatively smooth with reduced RMS roughnesses of 4.16 and 4.61 nm respectively (see Fig. 8d and f). This observation indicates that the surface composition distribution of the blend film may be changed by the annealing or the addition of DIO. It is known that enriched PC70BM at the interface between the active layer and the metal cathode lowers the barrier and thus facilitates charge collection.24 Therefore, after annealing or adding 3% DIO (v/v), the vertical composition/phase separation may be optimized, so a higher Jsc, improved FF and thus larger PCE can be realized. For the PBDTBSe/PC70BM (1:2, w/w) blend film, compared to the phase image without DIO (Fig. 8h), Fig. 8j with 3% DIO (v/v) as the additive displayed a smaller RMS roughness of 5.13 nm. The decrease of the surface roughness and the appropriate phase separation are also responsible for the enhancement of the Jsc and FF with the addition of DIO.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized two new fluorinated benzothiadiazole- and benzoselenadiazole-based D–A copolymers (PBDTBT and PBDTBSe), and demonstrated a detailed comparison between the two copolymers in terms of spectroscopic, thermal, electrochemical, charge transporting and photovoltaic properties. Obvious red-shifted UV-vis absorption was observed for the fluorinated benzoselenadiazole-based copolymers. The reduction of the bandgap energy by the replacement of S with Se is more due to the lowering of the LUMO energy level than the raising of the HOMO energy level of the copolymers. Moreover, the results showed that the incorporation of electron-deficient fluorine groups substantially lowers the HOMO energy levels, which contributes to the high Voc in the PSCs. The BHJ PSCs were prepared with the two polymers as the donor and PC70BM as the acceptor. The fabricated conditions, including the solvent, blend ratio, thermal annealing and additive, were fully optimized. The optimized photovoltaic performance (Voc = 0.88 V, Jsc = 10.73 mA cm−2, FF = 0.536 and PCE = 5.06%) obtained for PBDTBT showed a significantly higher Voc and Jsc than the benzoselenadiazole-based copolymer counterparts (Voc = 0.81 V, Jsc = 5.36 mA cm−2, FF = 0.506 and PCE = 2.20%), mostly due to the deeper-lying HOMO and better morphological properties of the active layer, respectively. Although PBDTBSe exhibits a broader absorption spectrum and a higher hole mobility, the PSCs still gave inferior Jsc, FF and PCE values due to the serious aggregation and low compatibility between the polymer and PC70BM. As a new electron-deficient unit, we believe that fluorinated benzoselenadiazole will be an effective acceptor unit used to build high-performance D–A copolymers in the foreseeable future if one can tune its compatibility with the PC70BM acceptor by copolymerizing with a suitable donor unit.
