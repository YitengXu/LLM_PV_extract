    , Accepted 5th October 2018First published on 8th October 2018AbstractIn this work, organic solar cells (OSCs) were fabricated with a blend of PC71BM and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2 employed as a binary photoactive layer and with a dihydronaphthyl-based C60 bisadduct (NCBA) small-molecule acceptor used as a third component material. We demonstrate that the short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), power conversion efficiency (PCE), and thermal stability can all be enhanced simultaneously. In addition, the crystallinity can be finely optimized and the photon harvesting ability was enhanced for short-wavelength light by adjusting the NCBA doping ratio, leading to efficient exciton dissociation and charge-carrier transport. At the same time, the ternary photoactive layer, with a small amount of NCBA as a third component material, reduced monomolecular recombination and bimolecular recombination under open-circuit and short-circuit conditions, respectively. Such a ternary structure with NCBA as a third component material helped enhance the crystallinity and fix the surface morphology of the photoactive layer, thus reducing the decay ratio while increasing the thermal annealing treatment time. Consequently, the PCE reaches 9.1% for ternary OSCs with a 12 wt% NCBA doping ratio in a blended acceptor, with 87.2% of the initial PCE value maintained after 100 h of thermal annealing treatment at 90 °C, which is much higher than that obtained for the PCE of binary OSCs.
1. Introduction
The photoactive layer of common binary organic solar cells (OSCs) consists of a blend of donor and acceptor materials.1–4 To improve power conversion efficiency (PCE), donor materials should have advantages of deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels, a low bandgap, a broad visible-light absorption spectrum, and higher hole mobility,5–7 and the acceptor materials should have advantages of shallow lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, high electron mobility, and strong electron affinity to accept electrons.8–10 As we know, the PCE of OSCs is proportional to the product of the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit density (JSC), and fill factor (FF). The VOC is governed by the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the donor, while the JSC is mainly determined by the visible-light absorption and charge carrier transport and collection.11 However, the common electron acceptor (PC71BM) shows a narrow visible-light absorption window with a deep LUMO energy level, which has limited photon harvesting and energy level differences.
Recently, ternary structure OSCs have attracted more attention due to their broad visible-light absorption, enhanced LUMO energy level for the acceptor and simple processing conditions used in single-junction OSCs.1,12 The ternary photoactive layer generally contains three components: the dominating donor:acceptor (D:A) system and the third component [the electron donor (D1:D2:A) and the electron acceptor (D:A1:A2) can be used as third component materials].1,13,14 The main fundamental working mechanisms of third component materials can be summarized in the following way: exciton dissociation, energy transfer, charge transfer and visible-light absorption and so on are all different work mechanisms of the photoactive layer compared with those of a common binary OSC. Thus, the selection of third component materials plays a vital role in photovoltaic performance.15,16 The Chunru group has synthesized fullerene derivatives of dihydronaphthyl-based C60 bisadduct (NCBA), with the chemical structure as shown in Fig. S1b.†17,18 The structure has the advantage of improved absorption in the 300–500 nm region, a shallower LUMO energy level and a higher thermally driven crystallization temperature compared with PC71BM.19
In this work, we report an improvement in ternary organic solar cell (OSC) performance based on the use of blended thin films of PC71BM and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2 as a binary photoactive layer and dihydronaphthyl-based C60 bisadduct (NCBA) as a third component material. The charge-carrier dynamics in the ternary OSCs were investigated by photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectroscopy. The photovoltaic performance and thermal stability of the ternary OSCs were also investigated systematically.
2. Experimental details
The fabricated method and parameters are shown in the ESI.† The OSC devices were fabricated with an inverted structure: ITO/ZnO/p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. Hole-only and electron-only SCLC devices were built using the structures “ITO/PEDOT:PSS/p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM/Au” and “Al/p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM/Al”, respectively. The energy level diagram for the OSC device is shown in Fig. S1.† The average value for the photovoltaic parameters was obtained from five OSCs fabricated in parallel.
3. Results and discussion
The OSC has the structure of the ITO/ZnO/p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:blend acceptor/MoO3/Ag, with the blend acceptor consisting of NCBA and PC71BM (the weight concentration of NCBA in the blend acceptor varies from 0 to 18 wt%, and neat NCBA). Fig. 1(a) presents the current–density–voltage (J–V) curves with 0, 12, and 18 wt% NCBA as a third component material and neat NCBA as an electron acceptor under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5-G illumination; all OSC parameters are shown in Table 1. Both the VOC and the other photovoltaic parameters (JSC, FF, and PCE) show different change trends for increasing NCBA concentration. The binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM OSC exhibits lower photovoltaic performance (VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE values of 0.78 V, 14.9 mA cm−2, 63.8%, and 7.41%, respectively). The photovoltaic performance is notably enhanced with increasing NCBA concentration, with the best values achieved with 12 wt% NCBA as the third component material (VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE values of 0.79 V, 17.1 mA cm−2, 67.9%, and 9.17%, respectively). However, after continued increases in the NCBA concentration, different change trends were observed for the VOC and the other photovoltaic parameters (JSC, FF, and PCE). The VOC value was continuously enhanced from 0.79 V (12 wt% NCBA concentration) to 0.8 V (18 wt% NCBA concentration), reaching the highest VOC value with neat NCBA as an acceptor material (VOC = 0.81 V). The JSC, FF, and PCE values exhibited a strong decrease (JSC, FF, and PCE values of 15.4 mA cm−2, 65.2%, and 8.03%, respectively, with 18 wt% NCBA). The worst photovoltaic performance was observed with neat NCBA as the acceptor material, even if the VOC value was significantly enhanced (JSC, FF, and PCE values of 12.2 mA cm−2, 54.4%, and 5.37%, respectively). Fig. 1(b) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for the binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM-based OSC and the optimized photovoltaic performance of the ternary OSC. The JSC values calculated from the EQE spectrum are 14.3 and 16.4 mA cm−2, corresponding to NCBA concentrations of 0 and 12 wt%, respectively (the JSC values, measured under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G illumination, were 14.9 and 17.1 mA cm−2, respectively), with the average error of both the measured and calculated JSC values lower than 5%.20 This finding clearly illustrates the agreement with the higher JSC of the OSC mentioned above. We focus next on investigating the reason for the different change trends for the NCBA concentration dependent photovoltaic parameters. At the same time, the reduction in JSC is mainly due to electrical losses rather than optical losses (as shown in the IQE curve in Fig. 1b). From the absorption spectrum of binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM thin films and ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM thin films, we found that the charge carrier recombination decreases when NCBA partially replaces PC71BM, as revealed in the IQE curve and the absorption spectrum. These results suggest that the IQE was enhanced because the photogenerated charge carriers weakened the charge carrier recombination within the photoactive layer before extraction from the photoactive layer to the electrode.

Enhancement of the VOC value depends on the NCBA concentration, with the highest VOC value achieved with the difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor (EAcceptorLUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor (EDonorHOMO),21,22 as defined by the following empirical formula:23,24  
However, after doping NCBA into the binary photoactive layer, the LUMO energy level of the blend acceptor was influenced as a function of NCBA concentration, with the new VOC values defined by the following empirical formula:25,26  where Ne is the quasi-frontier orbital density of the acceptor materials; VOC Binary1, VOC Binary2, and VOC Ternary are the VOC values of the binary OSCs and ternary OSC, respectively; Ne1 and Ne2 are the quasi-frontier orbital densities of acceptors 1 and 2 in the blend acceptor, respectively; and f1 and f2 are the weight composition ratios of acceptors 1 and 2 in the blend acceptor, respectively. The LUMO energy levels of PC71BM and NCBA are 3.7 eV and 3.9 eV, respectively. After partial replacement of PC71BM by NCBA, the LUMO energy level of the blend acceptor was enhanced with increased NCBA concentration, which favours enhancement of the difference between the LUMO of the blend acceptor and the HOMO of the donor. Thus, the VOC value is enhanced with increasing NCBA concentration, achieving the highest value with neat NCBA as an electron acceptor, even with poor photovoltaic performance. Among JSC, FF and PCE values showing the same change trends, the highest JSC value was achieved with 12 wt% NCBA replacing PC71BM (JSC = 17.1 mA cm−2). The JSC value is mainly determined by the visible-light absorption and charge carrier transport and collection, while the FF value is governed by the charge carrier recombination.27,28 Thus, we will investigate the effect of NCBA as a third component material on visible-light absorption and charge carrier mobility.
Fig. S2(a)† shows the visible absorption coefficients for NCBA, PC71BM and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2 at the same thickness (approximately 30 nm). Among the three materials, p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2 presented much higher absorption coefficients than the NCBA and PC71BM acceptor, indicating that p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2 had the predominant absorption contribution in these photoactive layers. The NCBA molecule shows a broader absorption spectrum over the wavelength range 450–650 nm compared with the PC71BM molecule but weaker visible absorption over the wavelength range 300–420 nm. Over the whole visible light wavelength range, NCBA shows lower visible absorption coefficients compared to the PC71BM thin film and the 89% absorption intensity of the PC71BM molecule. For a partial replacement of PC71BM by NCBA (at a concentration of 12 wt%), the complementary absorption spectrum in the range 300–450 nm for ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) thin films compared with binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM thin films is shown in Fig. S2(b)† (all thin films have a thickness of approximately 100 nm). The weak absorption spectrum in the range 500–690 nm is displayed compared with that in the binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM thin films. The visible-light absorption ratio for the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) thin films is reduced to approximately 4% compared with that of the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM (3:2) thin films.
PL and TRPL spectroscopy techniques were employed to investigate the working mechanism of the ternary photoactive layer, with the results shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b). The photoactive thin films were excited at a wavelength of 676 nm, with the neat p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2 thin films exhibiting a strong PL emission intensity and an emission peak at approximately 735 nm [as shown in Fig. 2(a)]. However, after doping electron acceptor materials into the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2 thin films, the significant fluorescence quenching among the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA binary thin films and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM ternary thin films gives quenching ratios of 89.4%, 85.8%, and 93.5% of the initial p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2 PL intensity, respectively. This result illustrates the more efficient exciton dissociation process at the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2/blend-acceptor-material interface compared with those of the binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2/PC71BM and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2/NCBA interface.29,30 After doping PC71BM and NCBA into p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2, the strongly reduced fluorescence lifetime (η) values are shown in Fig. 2(b), along with the further reduced η values for the NCBA:PC71BM blend as an electron-acceptor material. The η values for the neat p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2, binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2: PC71BM, and ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) are 7.5, 3.9, 2.6, and 2.2 ns, respectively. The short η value for the ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) thin films is attributed to the higher efficiency of exciton dissociation and to the fast speed of charge-carrier transport at the three interfaces of p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2/NCBA, p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2/PC71BM, and NCBA/PC71BM, which avoids electron–hole-pair recombination within the photoactive layer. This result indicates a potential route for improving NCBA exciton utilization efficiency, in addition to improving exciton dissociation at the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2/NCBA and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2/PC71BM interfaces.31–33

The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was employed to measure the charge-carrier mobility of ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM devices as a function of NCBA concentration. The SCLC curves are shown in Fig. 3, with all the hole-mobility (μh) and electron-mobility (μe) values summarized in Table 2. The μh value exhibited a slight decrease with a lower NCBA concentration and a significant decrease with neat NCBA as an electron acceptor; μh values of 2.74 × 10−3, 2.62 × 10−3, 2.42 × 10−3, and 0.95 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 correspond to the NCBA concentrations of 0, 12, 18, and 100 wt%, respectively, while the μe values are 2.25 × 10−3, 2.54 × 10−3, 2.15 × 10−3, and 1.05 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The enhancement of μe could be ascribed to the fact that a small amount of NCBA can boost the exciton dissociation and enhance the charge-carrier transfer at the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2/blend-acceptor interface.34 The μh value decreased linearly with increasing NCBA concentration, which is attributed to μh weakening associated with exciton dissociation and the fact that hole transport and collection are governed by the donor/anode modified layer interface.15,35 While the excess NCBA replaces PC71BM (the NCBA concentration is higher than 12 wt%), it leads to a significant decrease in the μe value, which possesses the disadvantages of charge-carrier extraction from the photoactive layer to the electrode.5 Simultaneously, the charge-carrier mobilities are determined by the crystallinity and the surface morphology of the photoactive layer.36–38 Thus, different change trends for μe and μh are observed depending on the NCBA concentration. The balance of electron and hole mobility plays vital roles in photovoltaic performance.39,40 The μe/μh value of 0.97 for 12 wt%-NCBA-based OSCs indicates more balanced charge-carrier transport within the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM photoactive layer, resulting in a higher FF and better photovoltaic performance. However, the excess NCBA concentration will cause lower charge-carrier mobility and imbalanced charge-carrier transport, which causes the electrons to accumulate at the cathode interface, thus decreasing photovoltaic performance.41 We next investigate the effect of NCBA concentration on the crystallinity and the surface morphology of the photoactive layer.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to detect the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM ternary thin film crystallinity, as shown in Fig. S3.† The crystallinities are related by Bragg's law,42λ = 2dsinθ,where λ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation (0.154 nm), θ is the peak-position half-angle, and the lamellar spacing (d) is the inter-planar distance. The diffraction peak angles (100) are related to the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2 molecule, and the 2θ sharp peak angles are 6.43°, 6.58°, 6.64°, and 6.68°, corresponding to NCBA concentrations in the blend acceptor of 0, 12, 18, and 100 wt%, respectively; the d values are 2.751, 2.683, 2.659, and 2.643 nm, respectively. The d value is slightly decreased upon doping NCBA into p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM binary thin films, which is attributed to the enhanced arrangement and the decreased molecular distance of both p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2 molecules.43,44 At the same time, the reflected diffraction-peak intensity is strongly enhanced and achieves the highest value with neat NCBA as the acceptor material. This phenomenon is caused by the enhancement of the molecular crystallinity of p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2 that is well mixed into the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2 rich phase.17,18 However, with neat NCBA replacing PC71BM as the electron acceptor, the crystallinity and the uniform intermixing of p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM thin films were completely changed and perhaps led to weakened exciton dissociation, which damages the electron-transport interpenetrating network and results in the formation of morphological traps and/or recombination centres within photoactive layers.45,46 In other work, it was reported that the photoactive layer with neat NCBA as an electron acceptor and lower bandgap materials as donor materials caused the large phase size of the NCBA molecule and the formation of several electron traps in the donor/NCBA interfaces, leading to damaged charge-carrier transport within the photoactive layer.47,48
Three-dimensional (3D) and phase images from atomic-force-microscopy (AFM) reveal the surface morphology of p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM ternary thin films dependent on the NCBA concentration [as shown in Fig. S4(a)–S4(d)†]. For the binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM and ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM thin films, it was clear that the statistical average roughness of the ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM thin films had slightly increased from 3.8 nm (0 wt%) to 4.5 nm after adding only 12 wt% NCBA, and further increased to 5.2 nm with 18 wt% NCBA replacing PC71BM. However, the higher statistical average roughness value of 12.75 nm was obtained when neat NCBA was used as the electron acceptor. At the same time, the higher statistical average roughness will damage the contact between p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM thin films and the charge-carrier extraction layer, leading to worse charge carrier transport and collection.49,50 As shown in the AFM phase images (Fig. S4b, d, f and h†), while the weight ratio of NCBA in the thin films is above 12%, aggregations in the ternary photoactive layer were formed due to the high crystallinity. However, when using the neat NCBA as an electron acceptor, the aggregations in the photoactive layer were damaged despite the higher crystallinity. The aggregations can degrade the surface morphology of the films and the device performance.

J
sat is the saturation current density, Jph is the photocurrent density, Veff is the effective voltage, Gmax is the maximum exciton generation rate, and Jph/Jsat is the charge-collection efficiency. To characterize the exciton-generation and exciton-dissociation processes in the photoactive layer that are dependent on the NCBA concentration, we plotted the Jph–Veff curves and calculated Jsat, Gmax, and Jph/Jsat under short-circuit and maximum power-point conditions (the Jph–Veff curves are shown in Fig. 4 and all the parameters are listed in Table 3). Jph and Veff are defined by the following formulae:2,51Jph = JL − JD,Veff = V0 − Va,where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0, Va is the applied voltage, and Jsat is the Jph value after reaching a saturated state (the Veff value is higher than 2 V).2Jph has a nearly linear dependence on the voltage at a low Veff value (lower than the VOC value), while it gently increases and reaches the saturated state between the VOC and Veff values. Jsat is only limited by the Gmax value, and follows the following formula:52Jsat = qLGmax,where L is the distance between the anode and the cathode. Jph values of 14.9, 17.1, 15.4, and 12.2 mA cm−2 correspond to p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM-based ternary OSCs with NCBA concentrations of 0, 12, 18, and 100 wt%, respectively; the Jsat values are 16.3, 18.5, 16.9, and 14.3 mA cm−2, respectively; the charge-collection efficiencies (Jph/Jsat) under short-circuit conditions are 91.4%, 92.2%, 91.1%, and 85.4%, respectively; and the Jph/Jsat values are 73.5%, 74.4%, 73.8%, and 59.4%, respectively, under maximum power-point conditions. Thus, the binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM and ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76)-based OSCs show higher Jph/Jsat values under short-circuit and maximum power-point conditions, implying efficient charge carrier transport and collection in the photoactive layers. The Gmax values of 1.02 × 10281, 1.16 × 1028, 1.06 × 1028, and 0.89 × 1028 m−3 s−1 correspond to the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM-based OSCs with NCBA concentrations of 0, 12, 18, and 100 wt%, respectively. The highest Gmax value is reached for the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76)-based OSC and is attributed to the harvesting of numerous photons and the generation of a significant amount of photogenerated charge carriers. Thus, the ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76)-based OSCs show optimized photovoltaic performance (JSC and FF) and photovoltaic parameters (Jph, Jsat, Gmax, and Jph/Jsat under short-circuit and maximum power-point conditions), which is attributed to the combination of efficient visible-light harvesting, better exciton dissociation, and improved charge-carrier transport and collection in the ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) photoactive layer. The Jph/Jsat under short-circuit conditions and maximum power output conditions imply the exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge carrier collection efficiency (ηcoll). However, the slightly lower photovoltaic parameters for the ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64)-based OSCs and significant reduction of the photovoltaic parameters for the binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA-based OSCs imply a lower photogenerated charge-carrier generation rate, a lower exciton dissociation ratio, and weakened charge carrier transport and charge carrier collection ability, which leads to lower photovoltaic performance and photovoltaic parameters.53

Charge carrier recombination in the ternary OSCs was examined by measuring the JSC and VOC values dependent on incident light intensity (3–100 mW cm−2). Fig. S5(a), S5(c), and S5(e)† show the characteristic J–V curves for the binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM-based OSC, ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76)-based OSC, and ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64)-based OSC for incident light intensities ranging from 3 to 100 mW cm−2. Fig. S5(b), S5(d), and S5(f)† show the normalized current densities for the three characteristic OSC J–V curves plotted in Fig. S5(a), S5(c), and S5(e),† respectively. With light irradiated onto the top of the photoactive layer, the photocurrent density is defined as:54Jphoto (I, V) = edG(I)PC(I, V),where d is the device thickness, G(I) is the generation rate of free electron–hole pairs per unit volume, and PC(I, V) is the charge-carrier collection efficiency. While the applied voltage is lower than the maximum power point (Vmax, approximately 0.65 V), the current density becomes insensitive to the applied voltage and achieves a saturated state at −0.5 V. This applied-voltage region (from −0.5 V to Vmax) is defined as the short-circuit condition. The saturation current (applied voltage is −0.5 V) is expressed as:55G(I) = Jphoto (V = −0.5 V).
When the applied voltage is −0.5 V, the maximum number of charge carriers can be swept out and collected by the individual electrodes, and the geminate recombination (monomolecular and bimolecular recombination) is avoided within the photoactive layer and at the photoactive layer/electrode interface, which is suitable for studying the charge-carrier recombination dynamics. PC(I, V) can be calculated by:56  
Thus, PC is close to 1 under the short-circuit condition.57,58 However, the current density is the sum of the current densities under dark conditions (Jdark), and the photocurrent density (Jphoto) and is defined as:58,59J(I, V) = Jphoto(I, V) + Jdark(V).
However, under the open-circuit condition (the applied voltage ranges from Vmax to VOC), the geminate recombination (monomolecular and bimolecular recombination) or single bimolecular recombination mainly dominates and numerous photogenerated charge carriers undergo charge-carrier recombination under the open-circuit condition; complete charge-carrier recombination occurs when the applied voltage is VOC.23 The PC value dependence on the incident light intensity is most prominent, with PC(I,Vapplied) ≈ PC(V).60
From Fig. S5(b), S5(d), and S5(f),† the normalized J–V curve shows different subtle spread speeds under the short-circuit condition as a function of NCBA concentration, indicating that bimolecular recombination exists at any applied voltage for the three OSCs and is weakened for binary OSCs and lower NCBA concentration ternary OSCs. However, while the excess NCBA replaces PC71BM, the ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64)-based OSCs achieve the same normalized photocurrent density and incur a higher applied voltage, while lower current intensities occur under the same applied voltage and incident light intensity compared with binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM-based OSCs and ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM(3:0.24:1.76)-based OSCs.
To investigate the dependence of photogenerated charge-carrier recombination and charge-transport processes in photoactive layers on the NCBA concentration, the photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC, FF and PCE of the three OSCs) were measured under different light intensities. The VOC value dependence on light intensity, as depicted in Fig. 5(a), can be described by the equation:61,62  where k is Boltzmann's constant. When the applied voltage equals the VOC value, all the photogenerated charge carriers will be recombined within the photoactive layer. The p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM binary OSCs and ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76)-based OSCs exhibit n values with lower slope (1.10 and 1.12, respectively), while the n-value slopes are significantly higher for ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64)-based OSCs, namely, 1.32. For the ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64)-based OSCs, the n values are significantly higher than 1, indicating that monomolecular recombination and bimolecular recombination are involved within the photoactive layer and that electrons and holes may prefer to be recombined at a trap state or a recombination centre.62 However, the n-value slopes are close to unity for p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM binary OSCs and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) ternary OSCs, implying that monomolecular recombination can be effectively suppressed and that only bimolecular recombination is involved within the photoactive layer. This result agrees well with the higher FF values for a small amount of NCBA replacing PC71BM.11,63
 Fig. 5  (a) JSC, (b) FF, (c) VOC and (d) PCE dependence on the light intensity for three OSCs. 
As seen in Fig. 5(b), for the three OSCs, the highest FF values of 72.1%, 76.5% and 63.6% were achieved, corresponding to the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM-based binary OSC, p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76)-based ternary OSC and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA-based binary OSC under 10 mW cm−2 visible light illumination, respectively. For 100 mW cm−2 visible light illumination onto the top of the OSC, the lowest FF values were reached (FF values of 63.7%, 67.5% and 53.6% respectively). Both the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM-based binary OSC and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76)-based ternary OSC exhibited a similar variation in the FF as a function of light intensity, while the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA-based binary OSC showed a higher slope. Under the maximum power point condition (MPP), the bimolecular recombination is a significant loss mechanism responsible for a decrease in FF values with increasing light intensity.64,65 The similar FF decrease ratio under different light intensities indicates that the same charge carrier recombination mechanism underlies the operation of the two OSCs under the MPP.58,66,67
The JSC values of the three OSCs were measured under different light intensities, as depicted in Fig. 5(c), can be described by the equation:61,62JSC ∝ Plightαwhere α is an exponential factor.60,68 The extracted α values are 0.974, 0.971, and 0.922 corresponding to the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM binary OSC, ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76)-based OSC, and ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64)-based OSC, respectively. The α is closer to unity, suggesting weak bimolecular recombination under the short-circuit conditions in the photoactive layers, while significant deviation of the α value from 1 indicates strong bimolecular recombination.62 The bimolecular recombination in binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM-based OSCs and ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76)-based OSCs can be effectively suppressed for efficient charge-carrier collection. However, the α value is significantly lower than 1 for ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64)-based OSCs, indicating that the bimolecular recombination within the photoactive layer under short-circuit conditions cannot be negligible.

Fig. 5d shows the dependence of the PCE value on the light intensity for the three OSCs. The value for the slope lies between the difference in PCE value under 10 mW cm−2 and 100 mW cm−2 solar simulation and the light intensity difference between 10 mW cm−2 and 100 mW cm−2 solar simulation. The ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64)-based OSCs show the highest slope value compared with the other two OSCs. Thus, the ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64)-based OSCs show better photovoltaic performance, especially under weak light intensity.
Transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) were employed to investigate the charge-carrier lifetime (τ) and the charge-carrier density (n), which are used to further assess the charge-carrier recombination dynamics and to corroborate the degree of suppressed charge-carrier recombination.69,70 Under the open-circuit condition, photogenerated charge carriers are recombined within the photoactive layer. n was obtained by fitting the TPV transient to an exponential and is defined as:70–72  C = ΔQ/ΔV0,  where A is the device area, and C is the capacitance, which is defined as the voltage change when a small number of photogenerated charge carriers are generated under weak incident light exposure to the photoactive layer, which was extrapolated back to V = 0. The τ values are found to follow an exponential dependence on VOC of the form:73–75        where λ is the recombination exponent; no and τΔno are the concentration and lifetime, respectively, of the photogenerated charge carriers generated by laser pulse illumination; m is the slope of τ(VOC); ϑ is the slope of n(VOC); and δ is the reaction order.75,76
As shown in Fig. 6(a), the τ value for the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) ternary OSC under the open-circuit condition was increased to 9.96 ms compared to 8.13 ms in the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM binary OSC under 1 Sun illumination under the open-circuit voltage condition. However, a significantly decreased τ value for the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64) ternary OSC was achieved, i.e., 6.75 ms. From Fig. 6(b), the charge-extraction time measured under a laser pulse under short-circuit conditions decreased to 0.41 ms for the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) ternary OSC compared with 0.67 and 1.1 ms for the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM binary OSC and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64) ternary OSC, respectively. These results indicate that charge traps were reduced and that the charge-extraction efficiency was higher in these OSCs compared to that of the other two OSCs. The highest n value was observed for the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) ternary OSC, while the n values for the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM binary OSC and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64) ternary OSC were slightly decreased by 10% and significantly decreased by 25%, respectively, under the open-circuit voltage condition under 1 Sun illumination (n3:2 = 7.8 × 1015, n3:0.24:1.76 = 8.8 × 1015, and n3:0.36:1.64 = 6.5 × 1015). Fig. 6(c) plots τ versus n for the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM binary OSC, p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) ternary OSC, and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64) ternary OSC under 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1 Sun illumination (the slope illustrates the λ value, which is defined as the recombination exponent). Furthermore, the λ value was also significantly decreased with 12 wt% NCBA replacing PC71BM (λ = 1.54), while higher λ values for both the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM (3:2) binary OSC and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64) ternary OSC were observed (λ = 1.81 and 1.98, respectively), leading to weakened charge-carrier recombination in the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) ternary OSC. These results indicate that both monomolecular and bimolecular recombinations are involved in the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM (3:2) binary OSC and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64) ternary OSC, which is attributed to the effect of trapping and release in energetic traps, as well as to trapping by morphological traps.77 At the same time, after excess NCBA replaced PC71BM, increased energy-level disorder was introduced into the photoactive layer, leading to charge-carrier recombination between free and trapped charge carriers.78,79

(c) τ vs. n for the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM binary OSC, p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) ternary OSC, and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64) ternary OSC under 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1 Sun illumination. 
We further investigated the thermal-stability as a function of thermal annealing time for the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM, ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76), and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64) OSCs that have undergone continuous thermal annealing at 90 °C for 100 h. Fig. 7 shows the dependence of the normalized photovoltaic parameters (VOC, FF, JSC and PCE) on thermal annealing time for the OSCs. After 100 h of thermal annealing treatment, the three OSCs each exhibit different decrease ratios. In the initial stage (during 0 to 20 hours), all the devices show significant attenuation, and the decrease ratio for the binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM OSC, ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA: PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76)-based OSC and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2: NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64)-based OSC is 0.72, 0.88 and 0.89, respectively. For the increased thermal annealing time, the binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM OSC exhibits a significant decrease, with only 52% of the initial PCE maintained at the end of the experiment (the decrease ratio of VOC, FF and JSC are 15.2%, 19.5% and 21% respectively). However, for the ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76)-based OSC and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64)-based OSC, the data show a gentle attenuation even for a long-term thermal annealing treatment, with a final PCE value of over 80% realized under 100 hours thermal annealing treatment (the decrease ratios for VOC, FF and JSC are 4%, 7.5% and 6.8%, respectively, for the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76)-based OSC, while the decrease ratios for VOC, FF and JSC are 4%, 7.3% and 6.6%, respectively, for the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64)-based OSC). Compared with the binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM OSC, the two ternary OSCs exhibit better thermal-stability and a similar decay ratio. This result implies better thermal annealing for the ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM thin films.
 Fig. 7  Normalized photovoltaic parameters (VOC, FF, JSC and PCE) as a function of thermal annealing time. The black square, red circle, and blue triangle represent the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM binary OSC, p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) ternary OSC, and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64) ternary OSC, respectively. 
We further investigated the effect of thermal annealing treatment on the crystallinity and surface morphology of the photoactive layer. Fig. S6 and S7† show the XRD curves and AFM images [the 3D and phase images measured using AFM for binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM for (a and b), ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) for (c and d), and ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64) thin films for (e and f)], respectively, for binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM, ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76), and ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64) thin films after 100 h of thermal annealing treatment at 90 °C. After the thermal annealing treatment, the diffraction peak intensities were found to significantly decrease, with many complex peaks introduced for the binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM thin film. Furthermore, the statistical average roughness for the binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM thin film was strongly enhanced (a value of approximately 180 nm), which is attributed to the disrupted molecular arrangement and weakened crystallinities.44,80 However, both the ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64) thin films exhibited a slight decrease in the diffraction peak intensities and a negligible increase in statistical average roughness, i.e., 6.8 and 6.5 nm, respectively. From the AFM phase images, the strong aggregations in the binary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM thin film are shown under 100 hours of thermal annealing treatment. However, for the ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.36:1.64) thin films under 100 hours of thermal annealing treatment, the data show a stable surface morphology for the photoactive layer.
The higher crystallinity and the smooth surface morphology of the photoactive layer favour the interface contact between the ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM and charge-carrier extraction layer, leading to better photovoltaic performance as a function of thermal annealing time. We concluded that the small amount of NCBA replacing the PC71BM molecule enhances the crystallinities and fixes the surface morphology of the ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM thin film, resulting in improved photovoltaic performance and thermal stability.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, in this paper, we report highly efficient OSCs with p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2 as donor materials and a blend of NCBA and PC71BM as an acceptor material. The best PCE, 9.1%, was achieved with p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) as a photoactive layer, which is much larger than the 7.65% and 5.37% PCE values obtained for the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM binary OSC and p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA binary OSCs, respectively. The improvement in PCE is mainly attributed to an increase in JSC and FF due to enhanced photon harvesting, improved exciton dissociation, increased charge-carrier mobility, and reduced monomolecular recombination and bimolecular recombination under open-circuit and short-circuit conditions, respectively. At the same time, replacing the PC71BM molecule with a small number of NCBA molecules led to an enhancement of the crystallinity and the thermal stability of the ternary p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2:NCBA:PC71BM thin films after a long thermal annealing treatment time. Thus, the p-DTS-(FBTTh2)2: NCBA:PC71BM (3:0.24:1.76) ternary OSC exhibited remarkable photovoltaic performance and thermal stability.
