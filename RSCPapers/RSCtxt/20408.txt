, Accepted 15th June 2023First published on 16th June 2023AbstractAnion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) are a promising next-generation technology for producing clean hydrogen using cost-effective, non-platinum group metal (non-PGM) based electrocatalysts. Despite their potential advantages, their low energy conversion efficiency presents a significant obstacle to their commercialization. Herein, we developed an oxygen deficient yolk–shell structured Co3O4 as the oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst for AEMWEs. The yolk–shell structure provided a large surface area, and the introduction of oxygen vacancies to the yolk–shell structured Co3O4 modulated the electronic structure and enhanced the OER activity. The abundant voids in the yolk–shell structure facilitated mass transport and effectively reduced mass transport loss in the AEMWE, resulting in excellent performance at high current density. This work suggests that the yolk–shell structured electrocatalysts can effectively improve the performance of AEMWEs, thereby addressing the major obstacle that is currently delaying their commercialization.
Introduction
An effective solution to the global energy crisis and climate change is to increase energy conversion efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. Efficient conversion and storage of sustainable renewable energy, such as solar and wind energy, is a key strategy to address the global energy crisis.1 However, these energies are intermittent and sensitive to conditions such as weather, season, and geographic location.2 Therefore, a technology for converting and storing renewable energy with intermittent characteristics into chemical energy is essential.3
Power-to-Gas (P2G) is a technology that converts electric power into chemical energy by producing fuel.2,4 Water electrolysis, which generates hydrogen (H2) from water using electric power, is gaining attention as an effective method for converting electric power into chemical energy. Among various water electrolysis technologies, anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWE) are considered a next-generation water electrolysis technology.5 AEMWEs employ a locally basic ionomer membrane as the electrolyte, enabling the use of earth abundant and cost-effective non-platinum group metals (non-PGMs) as electrode materials.6 In addition, the unique zero-gap configuration of AEMWEs minimizes the ohmic loss and realizes high-efficiency water electrolysis even at high current densities (>0.5 A cm−2).7 Despite these advantages, AEMWEs have lower performance and efficiency than the conventional proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs), delaying the commercialization of AEMWEs.8 To improve the performance of AEMWEs, it is necessary to use high-performance electrodes, especially highly active electrocatalysts.
Water electrolysis involves an oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 4OH− → 2H2O + 4e– + O2) and a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 2H2O + 2e– → 2OH− + H2). Although the HER is the fundamental reaction for hydrogen generation, the OER is the rate determining step (RDS) in water electrolysis, as the HER requires two electrons while the OER requires four electrons.9 Improving the efficiency of water electrolysis can be achieved by enhancing the OER kinetics through the development of highly active OER electrocatalysts. Generally, platinum group metal (PGM)-based OER electrocatalysts, such as RuO2 and IrO2, are considered the best electrocatalysts.10 However, their high cost and scarcity limit their use as an electrocatalyst. Therefore, the development of earth-abundant and cost-effective non-PGM based highly active OER electrocatalysts is required.11 Recently, various non-PGM based OER electrocatalysts, such as transition metal oxides, transition metal hydroxides, transition metal selenides, and transition metal phosphides, have been developed and shown high catalytic activity for the OER.12–15 Among various non-PGM based OER electrocatalysts, spinel cobalt oxide (Co3O4) is the preferred non-PGM based OER electrocatalyst because of its good stability and high activity in alkaline water electrolysis.16 In particular, Co3O4, which has high electrical conductivity, can realize high-performance AEMWE by minimizing the ohmic loss and ensuring durability.17
Herein, we developed a yolk–shell structured oxygen-defective Co3O4 electrocatalyst (R-Co3O4-YS) for the OER. The yolk–shell structure is structurally stable and provides a large surface area, making it suitable as a structure for OER electrocatalysts.18 The introduction of oxygen defects into the surface of Co3O4 improved the conductivity and regulated the surface adsorption energy of OH−, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity for the OER.19,20 Furthermore, the AEMWE equipped with R-Co3O4-YS demonstrated better performance compared to that equipped with RuO2. Particularly, the AEMWE equipped with R-Co3O4-YS exhibited excellent performance even at high current densities (>0.5 A cm−2), which is the operating condition of commercial water electrolyzers. This work demonstrates that the unsatisfactory performance of AEMWEs that is currently delaying their commercialization can be overcome through the development of highly active electrocatalysts.
Experimental
Preparation of yolk–shell-structured Co3O4 microspheres and oxygen deficient yolk–shell-structured Co3O4 microspheres
Yolk–shell structured Co3O4 microspheres (Co3O4-YS) were prepared by a one-step spray pyrolysis process. At first, the solution for spray pyrolysis was prepared by dissolving 0.2 M Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Samchun Chemical Co., Ltd) and 0.7 M sucrose (C12H22O11, Samchun Chemical Co., Ltd) in 1 L of distilled water. During the spray pyrolysis process, droplets were generated from the spray solution using a 1.7 MHz ultrasonic spray nebulizer consisting of six vibrators. The droplets were carried to a quartz reactor with a length of 1200 mm and diameter of 50 mm maintained at 700 °C using air as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 10 L min−1. The droplets were dried and decomposed to yolk–shell structured Co3O4 microspheres by a carbon combustion mechanism and their powder was collected in a Teflon bag filter. The schematic diagram and digital photo of the spray pyrolysis system are shown in Fig. S1.† Oxygen deficient yolk–shell structured Co3O4 microspheres (R-Co3O4-YS) were prepared by reducing yolk–shell structured Co3O4 microspheres with sodium borohydride (NaBH4). 10 mM NaBH4 solution and 0.5 g yolk–shell structured Co3O4 microspheres were mixed and stirred for 15 min. After the chemical reaction, samples were collected by centrifugation, thoroughly washed with DI water, and dried at room temperature.
Characterization
The morphological characteristics of the samples were investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN) and field emission-transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM, JEM-2100F). The crystal structures of the samples were analyzed using X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD, X'Pert PRO with Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å) at the Korea Basic Science Institute (Daegu). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the samples was performed using an ESCALAB-250 with Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). The surface area and porosities of the samples were analyzed via the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, using high-purity N2. The structural characteristics of the samples were investigated via Raman spectroscopy (Jobin Yvon LabRam HR800, excited by a 632.8 nm He/Ne laser) at room temperature.
Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical measurements were conducted with a rotating disk electrode (RDE, 0.198 cm2 of GC, Pine Instrument) in a three-electrode system. An RDE and Pt mesh were used as the working electrode and counter electrode. Hg/HgO (1 M KOH) was used as the reference electrode. 1 M KOH aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. All potentials were converted to the RHE reference scale. Polarization curves were calibrated by iR-correction. The ink solution was prepared using 20 mg of electrocatalysts, 100 μL of 5 wt% Nafion solution and 900 μL of ethanol.
The prepared ink solution was ultra-sonicated for 15 minutes. 5 μL of the ink was dropped on the RDE and dried. The OER polarization curves were obtained at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The Tafel slope was obtained by fitting the polarization curves with the Tafel formula (η = blogj + a, in which η is the overpotential, j is the current density and b is the Tafel slope).21 The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was calculated by measuring the double layer capacitance (Cdl). Cdl was measured by cyclic voltammetry with different scan rates of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 80 mV s−1 in the non-faradaic region. The ECSA was then calculated by using the following equation: ECSA = Cdl/Cs, where Cs was 40 μF cm−2.22 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed at 1.68 V vs. RHE from 100 kHz to 1 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV. The durability test was performed at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 16 h.
AEMWE testing
The AEMWE comprises a titanium flow channel (anode), a graphite flow channel (cathode), a gold-plated current collector, an anion exchange membrane (AEM, Sustainion®X37-50 Grade T, Dioxide Materials), and an end plate. For the anode, the ink solution was sprayed onto commercial nickel foam after mixing the appropriate amounts of catalysts, deionized (DI) water, isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, and ionomer (Fumion® FAA-3-solut-10). The loading mass of the OER electrocatalyst was 5 ± 0.5 mg cm−2. For the cathode, the ink solution was prepared by mixing Pt/C (40 wt%, HISPEC 4000, Johnson Matthey) with a Nafion binder on carbon cloth with a microporous layer. The loading mass of the HER electrocatalyst was approximately 1.0 mgPt cm−2. The AEMWE was supplied with a 1 M KOH solution at a flow rate of 50 mL min−1. The active area of the AEMWE was 3.8 cm2. The polarization curves of the AEMWE were measured using a DC power supply. The durability of the AEMWE was tested at 0.5 A cm−2 for 160 hours. The AEM electrolyzer power was calculated by multiplying the cell voltage and current density to calculate the cell efficiency. A lower heating value (LHV) was used as an H2 power out. The cell efficiency was calculated using the following equation.  where ΔHH2,LHV is the LHV reaction enthalpy for water electrolysis (241.8 kJ mol−1). nH2,measured is the measured hydrogen production rate (mol s−1), I is the current applied (A) and V is the voltage applied (V). The turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated as (a × i)/(4 × n × F) for the OER in the AEMWE. In this equation, i represents the current density and F denotes Faraday's constant (96485 C mol−1). The value of n represents the number of moles of the electrocatalyst, while the factor of 4 accounts for the number of electrons transferred during the OER.
Results and discussion
The formation mechanism of yolk–shell structured Co3O4 microspheres (Co3O4-YS) with oxygen vacancies is described in Scheme 1. The spray pyrolysis process was used to prepare Co3O4-YS, and the schematic diagram of the equipment is shown in Scheme 1a. The formation mechanism of Co3O4-YS is exhibited in Scheme 1b. The spray solution, which included cobalt nitrate and sucrose, was transformed into droplets using an ultrasonic humidifier. The generated droplets were carried into the hot furnace by a carrier air gas. In the initial step, the droplets were dried and decomposed to form spherical cobalt oxide and carbon composite immediately. Co3O4-YS was formed by the carbon combustion mechanism, which has been reported in the previous literature, and its powder was collected in the bag filter.23 The entire series of processes were a single step, and yolk–shell particles were successfully synthesized within seconds. Finally, oxygen vacancies were formed on the surface of Co3O4-YS by simply immersing in NaBH4 solution, as shown in Scheme 1c.

The morphological characteristics of Co3O4-YS are exhibited in Fig. 1. The low magnification SEM and TEM images in Fig. 1a and b revealed that the prepared microspheres had an overall uniform yolk–shell structure.

The slight difference in size distribution between particles is due to the size of droplets generated by the ultrasonic humidifier. Co3O4-YS had multiple shells, which might be formed by repeated carbon combustions, as shown in Fig. 1c. The multiple shells could provide plentiful OER active sites, and nanopores are observed between the nanocrystals constituting the yolk–shell formed by carbon combustion at high temperature during spray pyrolysis. This could effectively improve the electrolyte penetration, accelerate the bubble release rate, and avoid random particle aggregation during the OER process. The HR-TEM image in Fig. 1d exhibited clear lattice fringes separated by 0.24 nm, which corresponds to the (311) crystal plane of the cubic-Co3O4 phase.24 The SAED pattern in Fig. 1e also confirmed the formation of the cubic-Co3O4 phase. The elemental mapping images in Fig. 1f revealed that the Co3O4 nanocrystals were uniformly distributed throughout the yolk–shell structure. The prepared Co3O4-YS was formed at a high temperature by the carbon combustion mechanism.
Regarding the OER, the formation of oxygen vacancies in highly crystalline pure Co3O4 could effectively modulate the electronic structure and greatly enhance the inherent conductivity, resulting in enhanced OER properties. The morphological characteristics of Co3O4-YS with oxygen vacancies (referred to as R-Co3O4-YS), which were obtained by simply immersing in NaBH4 solution, are shown in Fig. 2. The low magnification SEM and TEM images in Fig. 2a and b showed that the yolk–shell structure of overall microspheres was well preserved after the NaBH4 treatment, indicating that the NaBH4 treatment did not affect the morphology of the yolk–shell structure. Na and B components in Fig. S2† were rarely observed, which verified that NaBH4 has been sufficiently removed after treatment. However, the surface of the yolk–shell microspheres became partly rough and some of the nanosheets were observed as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 2c and d. Furthermore, the edges of nanocrystals consisting of yolk–shell microspheres became fuzzy, rough, and also smaller. This was related to a surface-restructuring process from nanoparticles to nanosheets during the NaBH4 reduction process.25,26 The nanosheets formed on the Co3O4-YS had exposed facets, which contributed to improved OER properties, where the electrocatalytic reaction usually occurs on the interface between the electrocatalysts and the electrolyte/intermediates. The lattice fringes after the NaBH4 treatment in Fig. 2d exhibited an identical value of 0.24 nm, corresponding to the (311) crystal plane of the cubic-Co3O4 phase. On the other hand, the SAED patterns in Fig. 2e demonstrated the spinel polycrystalline structure of Co3O4 as well as lower crystallinity after NaBH4 treatment. The elemental mapping images in Fig. 2f reveal that the structure of Co3O4-YS was well maintained after the NaBH4 treatment. The specific surface area and pore structure of yolk–shell microspheres were examined by BET–BJH measurements. The isotherm curves of the two samples represented type II characteristics with an H2 hysteresis loop, indicating that the yolk–shell microspheres had macropores corresponding to the void space of the yolk–shell as shown in Fig. S3a and c.† The specific surface areas of the two samples (Co3O4-YS and R-Co3O4-YS) are calculated as 16.03 and 20.49 m2 g−1, which showed that there were negligible changes in the specific surface area and pore size distribution (Fig. S3b and d†) after NaBH4 reduction. It revealed that the specific surface area or pore structure was not affected even though some of the nanocrystals were transformed into the nanosheet form after NaBH4 treatment.

The crystalline phase and structure of Co3O4-YS and R-Co3O4-YS were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 3a. It was clearly confirmed that Co3O4-YS and R-Co3O4-YS could be indexed to the cubic Co3O4 phase (PDF #43-1003), verifying that the crystalline phase was well maintained after NaBH4 treatment. As confirmed by TEM images in Fig. 2c, the XRD pattern of R-Co3O4-YS showed slightly broadened peaks indicating an increase in the disorder of lattices. The NaBH4 treatment modified the surface state of the pristine Co3O4, offering more exposure of active sites. Furthermore, the average crystallite sizes of the Co3O4 (311) plane in Co3O4-YS and R-Co3O4-YS were calculated to be about 36.8 and 29.7 nm, respectively, using the Debye–Scherer equation.

To specifically demonstrate the modification of the surface state after NaBH4 treatment, X-ray spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to analyze Co3O4-YS and R-Co3O4-YS. Deconvolution of XPS Co 2p peaks at binding energies of 780.1 eV (Co 2p3/2) and 795.2 eV (Co 2p1/2) with a spin–orbit splitting of 15.1 eV confirmed the presence of cubic Co3O4 in Co3O4-YS and R-Co3O4-YS.
Furthermore, two additional peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 were deconvoluted, with 779.9/795.1 eV and 781.4/797.0 eV corresponding to Co3+ and Co2+, respectively.27,28 Comparison of the two samples Co3O4-YS and R-Co3O4-YS revealed that the ratio of Co2+/Co3+ clearly increased, as shown in Fig. 3b. This indicated that Co3+ ions on the surface of the yolk–shell microspheres have been partially reduced to Co2+ ions, which corresponded to the generation of oxygen vacancies. The high-resolution O 1s spectrum also proved the generation of oxygen vacancies, as shown in Fig. 3c. The higher ratio of the O2-type fitting peak at 531.8 eV, related to defect sites that originated from low oxygen coordination, indicated that R-Co3O4-YS possessed more oxygen vacancies.29 XPS analysis revealed that the introduction of oxygen defects induced changes in the electronic structure of Co3O4. Furthermore, Wang's group confirmed through XAFS analysis that the introduction of oxygen defects in Co3O4 results in a decrease in the energy of Co K-edge, leading to modifications in its electronic structure. Moreover, Raman analysis was conducted to study the crystal structure and surface defects. The five distinct Raman bands at about 189.3, 476.9, 515.3, 614.3, and 684.0 cm−1 for the two samples could be related to the F(1)2g, E2g, F(2)2g, F(3)2g, and A1g symmetry of crystalline cubic Co3O4, respectively. The A1g symmetry of R-Co3O4-YS displayed a significant negative shift, which demonstrated the creation of more oxygen vacancies.30,31 All of these results verified that yolk–shell structured Co3O4 microspheres after NaBH4 treatment could be achieved, featuring Co3O4 nanosheets decorated on the surface of Co3O4-YS with enriched edge sites and oxygen vacancies, which would be beneficial for the OER.32
The catalytic activity of Co3O4-YS and R-Co3O4-YS for the OER was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in 1 M KOH (Fig. 4a) and benchmarked against the commercial RuO2 OER electrocatalyst. The overpotential of RuO2 at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 was 342 mV. The overpotentials of Co3O4-YS and R-Co3O4-YS at the same current density were 405 mV and 373 mV, respectively, indicating that oxygen vacancies enhanced the OER activity. However, both required higher overpotentials at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 than RuO2. Interestingly, as the potential increased, the current densities of Co3O4-YS and R-Co3O4-YS increased rapidly. The overpotentials required to achieve a current density of 30 mA cm−2 were 398 mV (R-Co3O4-YS), 433 mV (Co3O4-YS) and 440 mV (RuO2). Commercial water electrolyzers typically operate at high current densities (≥0.5 A cm−2), so achieving low overpotential at high current densities is particularly important.33 Co3O4-YS requires a lower overpotential than RuO2 at high current density and exhibits a lower onset potential than Co3O4-YS, which is expected to greatly improve the performance of the AEMWE. In order to investigate the OER kinetics, Tafel slopes were calculated from LSV, as shown in Fig. 4b. The Tafel slopes were 49 mV dec−1 (Co3O4-YS), 49 mV dec−1 (R-Co3O4-YS), and 62 mV dec−1 (RuO2), respectively. As for the value of the Tafel slope, Co3O4-YS and R-Co3O4-YS showed lower values than RuO2.

The electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) were calculated by measuring the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) from the cyclic voltammetry in the non-faradaic region with different scan rates, as shown in Fig. S4a and b.† LSV normalized by ECSA represents the OER activity per ECSA, which is one of the parameters representing the intrinsic OER activity (Fig. S6†).34 The OER activity per ECSA of R-Co3O4-YS was better than that of Co3O4-YS, indicating that oxygen vacancies enhanced the intrinsic OER activity.35 Additionally, the LSV normalized by BET surface areas also exhibited the same results (Fig. S7†). To further investigate the charge transfer resistance (Rct), the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of Co3O4-YS and R-Co3O4-YS, and RuO2 was performed at 1.727 VRHE (Fig. 4c). The charge transfer resistance of R-Co3O4-YS was 2.1 Ω, which was smaller than that of Co3O4-YS (3.3 Ω), indicating that the oxygen vacancies significantly reduced the charge transfer resistance.36 The durability of R-Co3O4-YS was investigated using the chronopotentiometry test for 16 h at 10 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 4d. During the durability test, the potential change was stable.
The AEMWE was assembled to investigate the effect of OER kinetics of the electrocatalyst on the devices.37 The detailed configuration is shown in Fig. 5a. To systematically analyze the effect of the OER electrocatalyst on the performance of the AEMWE, all conditions except for the OER electrocatalyst were kept the same. To minimize the polarization loss of the AEMWE due to the HER, Pt/C was used as the HER electrocatalyst. A commercially available anion exchange membrane (X37-50, Dioxide materials) was used in the AEMWE. The polarization curves of the AEMWE were obtained by measuring the cell voltages at a fixed current density, as shown in Fig. 5b.

(d) Turnover frequency (TOF) of RuO2 and R-Co3O4-YS. (e) Overvoltage (η) subdivisions of the AEMWE by ohmic loss (ηohm), activation loss (ηact), and mass transport loss (ηmass). 
The AEMWE equipped with RuO2 showed better performance than the AEMWE equipped with R-Co3O4-YS at lower current densities (<1.0 A cm−2). However, the performance of the AEMWE equipped with R-Co3O4-YS was better at high current densities at which commercial electrolyzers actually operate. To achieve a current density of 2.0 A cm−2, the AEMWE required 1.932 Vcell (R-Co3O4-YS) and 2.016 Vcell (RuO2). Cell efficiency, which is another indicator of cell performance and indicates energy conversion efficiency, was calculated at low (0.5 A cm−2), medium (1.0 A cm−2) and high (2.0 A cm−2) current densities, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5c. Similar to the results of the polarization curves, the AEMWE equipped with R-Co3O4-YS showed higher energy conversion efficiencies at current densities above about 1.0 A cm−2. The utilization of RuO2 and R-Co3O4-YS at the molecular level was analyzed through turnover frequency (TOF) calculation.38 The TOF at a current density of 2.0 A cm−2 is 0.250 O2 s−1 (R-Co3O4-YS) and 0.13792 O2 s−1 (RuO2). This indicates that, at the molecular level, R-Co3O4-YS has better catalytic activity than RuO2, as shown in Fig. 5d.
In order to analyze the effect of the OER electrocatalyst on the AEMWE more specifically, the polarization curve was divided into three overvoltages: ohmic loss (ηohm), activation loss (ηact), and mass transport loss (ηmass), as shown in Fig. 5e. Since all conditions other than the OER electrocatalyst were the same, the voltage loss of the AEMWE was caused by the OER electrocatalysts. The ohmic loss of the AEMWE is affected by the electronic and ionic conductivity of each component, such as the current collector, flow channel, AEM, electrocatalysts, etc.39 The total ohmic resistance of the AEMWE was measured by high-frequency resistance (HFR) in EIS analysis. AEMWE equipped with RuO2 and R-Co3O4-YS showed similar HFR values of 0.063 and 0.062 ohm cm−2. Therefore, the ohmic loss of the AEMWE equipped with RuO2 and R-Co3O4-YS was almost the same at the same current density. In addition, since the HFR values were similar, the HFR-free polarization curves of the AEMWEs equipped with RuO2 and R-Co3O4-YS were similar to the polarization curve (Fig. S8†). The activation loss of the AEMWE is affected by the kinetics.40 The AEMWE equipped with RuO2 showed a relatively lower activation loss than R-Co3O4-YS, indicating that RuO2 still has better intrinsic OER activity. Interestingly, mass transport loss of the AEMWE equipped with R-Co3O4-YS was much lower than that of RuO2. In addition, the difference became larger as the current density increased.41 The abundant voids of the yolk–shell structure facilitate mass transport, minimizing voltage loss caused by the mass transport loss. The performance at high current densities (1.0 A cm−2) is particularly important because commercial water electrolyzers operate at high current densities. The AEMWE equipped with R-Co3O4-YS, which has enhanced OER activity due to the introduction of oxygen vacancies, has higher activation loss than RuO2, but the unique yolk–shell structure of R-Co3O4-YS effectively lowered the mass transport loss, realizing the high-performance AEMWE.42,43 To investigate mass transport behavior in the yolk–shell structure, we synthesized non-yolk–shell Co3O4 (Co3O4-dense). Subsequently, oxygen defects were introduced into Co3O4-dense, which was named R-Co3O4-dense. SEM images of Co3O4-dense and R-Co3O4-dense are presented in Fig. S9 and S10,† respectively. The AEMWE equipped with R-Co3O4-dense exhibited higher mass transport losses compared to that with R-Co3O4-YS across all current ranges (Fig. S11†). These results indicate that the yolk–shell structure is advantageous for mass transport.
The durability of the AEMWE equipped with R-Co3O4-YS was evaluated at 0.5 A cm−2 for 160 h, as shown in Fig. S12.† The AEMWE exhibited a relatively stable degradation rate of 0.001 V h−1. The gas generated during the durability test was collected to calculate the faradaic efficiency of the AEMWE, as shown in Fig. S12.†44 The Faraday efficiency was found to be approximately 98–99%, indicating that most of the current passing through the AEMWE produces gas through the normal water electrolysis reaction. Furthermore, the change in cell efficiency during the durability test was calculated and is shown in Fig. S13.† Remarkably, despite the long-term durability test, the AEMWE exhibited a very slow degradation rate of 0.04% per hour.
Conclusions
In summary, we developed a yolk–shell structured oxygen-defective Co3O4 electrocatalyst (R-Co3O4-YS) for the OER. The yolk–shell structure was structurally stable and provided a large surface area, making it suitable as a structure for OER electrocatalysts. The introduction of oxygen vacancies to the yolk–shell structured Co3O4 (Co3O4-YS) modulated the electronic structure and enhanced the OER activity. The abundant voids in the yolk–shell structure of R-Co3O4-YS facilitated mass transport and effectively reduced mass transport loss in the AEMWE, resulting in excellent performance at high current density. The structural and electrochemical results presented in this study suggest that the yolk–shell structure is a promising structure for water electrolysis electrocatalysts, and offer valuable insight for the development of nanostructures for water electrolysis.
