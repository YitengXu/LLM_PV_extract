    , Accepted 16th October 2019First published on 16th October 2019AbstractThe Janus structure, by combining properties of different transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers in a single polar material, has attracted increasing research interest because of its particular structure and potential application in electronics, optoelectronics and piezoelectronics. In this work, Janus SnSSe monolayer is predicted by means of first-principles calculations, and it exhibits dynamic and mechanical stability. By using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and spin–orbit coupling (SOC), the Janus SnSSe monolayer is found to be an indirect band-gap semiconductor, whose gap can easily be tuned by strain. High carrier mobilities are obtained for SnSSe monolayer, and the hole mobility is higher than the electron mobility. For SnSSe monolayer, a uniaxial strain in the basal plane can induce both strong in-plane and much weaker out-of-plane piezoelectric polarizations, which reveals the potential as a piezoelectric two-dimensional (2D) material. High absorption coefficients in the visible light region are observed, suggesting a potential photocatalytic application. Calculated results show that SnSSe monolayer has a very high power factor, making it a promising candidate for thermoelectric applications. Our works reveal that the Janus SnSSe structure can be fabricated with unique electronic, optical, piezoelectric and transport properties, and can motivate related experimental works.
I. Introduction
After the exploration of graphene,1 the search for new 2D materials with unique structures and electronic properties has been in progress due to potential applications in the field of optoelectronics and energy conversion and storage. Many 2D materials have been synthesized experimentally or predicted theoretically, such as TMD, group-VA, group IV–VI and group-IV monolayers.2–9 Among these, TMD monolayers are prominent due to their finite direct band gaps, large on–off ratios, high carrier mobilities and strong optoelectronic responses.10–12 Due to the lack of inversion symmetry, 2H TMD monolayers posses a spin–orbit splitting in the valence band, allowing for valley-selective excitation of carriers.13 Using symmetry analysis, the piezoelectric coefficients of TMD monolayers have been calculated with density functional perturbation theory (DFPT).14 Many studies of heat transport properties of TMD monolayers have been reported, and strain effects on their heat transport properties have been investigated.15–20
In general, the two-layer chalcogen atoms in TMD monolayers are the same element. If the two-layer chalcogen atoms are different, a Janus monolayer will be constructed, and then the symmetry will be reduced. Recently, Janus monolayer MoSSe has been successfully synthesised by different experimental strategies, leading to an out-of-plane structural asymmetry.5,21 Compared to commonly used 2D materials, the out-of-plane piezoelectric effects of monolayer and multilayer Janus TMD MXY (M = Mo, W; X/Y = S, Se, Te) have been achieved, and the out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient is found to be the strongest in multilayer MoSTe.22,23 The carrier mobility of monolayer MoSSe can be improved by building bilayer or trilayer structures.24 The mechanical and electronic properties of Janus monolayer MXY (M = Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W; X/Y = S, Se, Te) have been systematically investigated using density functional theory (DFT).25 A significant Rashba spin splitting can be induced by the intrinsic out-of-plane built-in electric field in monolayer Janus WSeTe.26 Janus MoSSe and PtSSe monolayers are predicted to be potential wide solar-spectrum water-splitting photocatalysts.27,28 The electronic and optical properties of MoSSe–WSSe vertical and lateral heterostructures have been studied by first-principles calculations.29 The lattice thermal conductivities of MoSSe/ZrSSe/PtSSe monolayer were predicted by the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation to be much lower than those of the MoS2/ZrS2/PtS2 monolayers.30–32
In this work, inspired by the already synthesized 1T structure of SnS2/SnSe2,6,7 we systematically investigate the electronic structures, carrier mobilities, piezoelectric properties, optical properties and transport coefficients of Janus SnSSe monolayer. We predict that dynamically and mechanically stable SnSSe monolayer has distinctive electronic, optical, piezoelectric and transport properties.
II. Computational detail
Within DFT,33 a full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave method is used to investigate electronic structures of SnSSe monolayer by using WIEN2k code.34 We use the popular GGA of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE)35 as the exchange–correlation potential, and the SOC was included self-consistently.36–39 To attain reliable results, we use a 30 × 30 × 1 k-point mesh in the first Brillouin zone (BZ) for the self-consistent calculation, make harmonic expansion up to lmax = 10 in each of the atomic spheres, and set Rmt × kmax = 8. The charge convergence threshold is set as 0.0001|e| per formula unit, in which e is the electron charge. The electronic transport coefficients of Janus SnSSe monolayer are calculated through solving Boltzmann transport equations within the constant scattering time approximation (CSTA), as implemented in the BoltzTrap package.40 To attain accurate transport coefficients, a 110 × 110 × 1 k-point mesh is used in the first BZ for the energy band calculation. The phonon calculations are carried out by VASP+PHONOPY code41–44 with a supercell of 6 × 6 × 1 using the finite displacement method. The kinetic energy cutoff is set to 500 eV. We calculate the elastic tensor and piezoelectric stress tensors within DFPT,45 using the VASP code.
Due to 3D periodic boundary conditions, the 2D elastic coefficients C2Dij and piezoelectric stress coefficients e2Dij have to be renormalized by the length of unit cell along the z direction (Lz): C2Dij = LzC3Dij and e2Dij = Lze3Dij. For 2D materials, it is noted that the calculated optical properties and electrical conductivity also depend on Lz,46,47 which should be normalized by multiplying Lz/d, where d is the thickness of 2D material. However, d is not well defined like graphene. In this work, Lz = 20 Å is used as d.
III. Structure and stability
The crystal structure of Janus SnSSe monolayer is shown in Fig. 1, and the rhombus primitive cell and the rectangle supercell are marked. It is useful for the calculations of carrier mobilities and piezoelectric coefficients to use a rectangle supercell. With Pt sandwiched between the S and Se layers, the symmetry of Janus SnSSe monolayer (no. 156) is lower than that of the SnS2 or SnSe2 monolayer (no. 164) due to the lack of the reflection symmetry with respect to the central Sn atoms. To avoid spurious interaction between neighboring periodic images, the vacuum space along the z direction is set to more than 18 Å to separate periodic images. The optimized lattice constant of Janus SnSSe monolayer is 3.784 Å with GGA, which is between the constants of SnS2 (3.69 Å) and SnSe2 (3.86 Å).48 To confirm the stability of SnSSe monolayer, the phonon dispersion of Janus monolayer SnSSe is plotted in Fig. 2, which shows no imaginary modes, suggesting that monolayer SnSSe is dynamically stable. Due to the three atoms in the unit cell, 3 acoustic and 6 optical phonon branches are observed. Due to D3h symmetry of SnSSe monolayer, the optical lattice-vibration modes at the Γ point can be defined as: Γoptical ≡ A2′′(IR) + A1′(R) + E′(IR + R) + E′′(R)(1)where IR and R mean infrared- and Raman-active mode, respectively. The optical phonon frequencies of SnSSe at the Γ point are 9.40 THz (A2′′), 6.40 THz (A1′), 5.29 THz (E′) and 3.85 THz (E′′). The mechanical stability of SnSSe monolayer can be examined by using the elastic constants Cij. Due to hexagonal symmetry, two independent elastic constants C11 and C12 are calculated, C11 = C22 = 62.50 N m−1 and C12 = 17.68 N m−1, and C66 = (C11 − C12)/2 = 22.41 N m−1, which satisfy the Born criteria of mechanical stability,49 namely C11 > 0, C66 > 0(2)The Young's modulus C2D(θ) can be calculated on the basis of the elastic constants. The Young's modulus C2D(θ) along the in-plane θ can be expressed as follows:50 (3)where A = (C11C22 − C122)/C66 − 2C12. C2D(θ) is shown in Fig. 2, and it shows strong mechanical isotropy for SnSSe monolayer. The calculated C2D(θ) is 57.50 N m−1, which is smaller than that of MoSSe (113.0 N m−1),30 indicating that monolayer SnSSe is less rigid than MoSSe monolayer. The Poisson's ratio ν(θ) is also isotropic, and the calculated ν is 0.28. The shear modulus G2D equals C66. The related data are summarized in Table 1. The phonon calculations and elastic constants prove that Janus monolayer SnSSe is dynamically and mechanically stable. Monolayer SnX2 (X = S, Se) materials have been synthesized,6,7 and MoSSe monolayer has also been successfully fabricated.5,21 A similar growth method to that of monolayer MoSSe can be used to realize Janus monolayer SnSSe.

IV. Electronic structure
It has been proved that the SOC has important effects on electronic structures of 2D materials, like Janus TMD monolayers,51 Janus monolayer SbTeI and BiTeI52,53 and monolayer Sb and Bi.54 Thus, the SOC is included for electronic structure calculations of Janus SnSSe monolayer, and the related energy bands with GGA and GGA+SOC are plotted in Fig. 3. By using GGA, an indirect gap of 0.95 eV was obtained with the valence band maximum (VBM) at the Γ point and conduction band minimum (CBM) at the M point. It is noted that the bands around VBM are very flat, which can produce very large effective masses of VBM. When including SOC, the gap reduces to 0.83 eV, and a spin–orbit splitting at the Γ point in the valence bands near the Fermi level is 0.266 eV. The electronic structures of SnSTe (a0 = 3.89 Å) and SnSeTe (a0 = 4.00 Å) are also calculated, and their energy bands are plotted in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† The calculated results show that they are all metals.

Strain can effectively tune the electronic structures of TMD and Janus TMD monolayers.51,55–59 Here, the effects of biaxial strain on the electronic structures of SnSSe monolayer are examined. To simulate biaxial strain, a/a0 is used with a/a0 < 1 (a/a0 > 1) being compressive (tensile) strain, where a and a0 are the strained and unstrained lattice constant, respectively. The energy band gap (gap) and spin–orbit splitting value at the Γ point (Δ) as a function of a/a0 are shown in Fig. 4, and the related energy band structures with a/a0 from 0.94 to 1.06 are plotted in Fig. 5. It is found that the energy band gap increases monotonously with a/a0 changing from 0.94 to 1.06, which is different from the other Janus TMD monolayers (up-and-down trend).51 With a/a0 increasing from 0.94 to 1.04, Δ decreases monotonously, and then a rapid decrease from 1.04 to 1.06 occurs. This is because the VBM changes from the Γ point to another point along the Γ–K direction. The strain can tune the positions of the conduction band extremum (CBE), and the second CBE changes from K point to Γ point, when strain varies from compressive strain to tensile strain. The conduction band convergence can be realized by tensile strain, which can be observed at the a/a0 = 1.06 point. The more localized valence bands can be induced by tensile strain. These can have an important influence on electronic transport properties of SnSSe monolayer. The uniaxial strain effects on electronic structures of SnSSe are also considered, and the energy band gap and spin–orbit splitting value at the high symmetry Γ point under uniaxial strain along x and y directions by using GGA+SOC are given in Fig. S2 of the ESI.† Calculated results show that the gap shows an up-and-down trend along both x and y directions, and the spin–orbit splitting has a complex dependency on uniaxial strain. The up-and-down trend of the gap as a function of strain can also be found in many 2D materials, like MoS2,60 Janus TMD monolayers,51 GeS61 and so on.

V. Carrier mobility
As is well known, the carrier mobility of a semiconductor is an important factor for great potential in electronics and optoelectronics. To evaluate the carrier mobility, deformation potential (DP) theory has been proposed by Bardeen and Shockley,62 which can be used to calculate the intrinsic carrier mobility of 2D materials. In this theory, the carrier mobility of a 2D material (μ2D) is defined as: (4)where T is temperature, m* is the effective mass in the transport direction, and  is the average effective mass. C2D is the elastic modulus derived from C2D = [∂2E/∂2δ]/S0, where E is the total energy after applying uniaxial strain (δ = Δl/l0) and S0 is the area at equilibrium. In addition, El is the DP constant defined by El = ΔE/δ, where ΔE is the energy shift of the band edge of CBM or VBM with respect to the vacuum level. After attaining μ2D, the relaxation time τ can be calculated by: τ = μ2Dm*/e(5)
By using DP theory, the carrier mobilities of SnSSe monolayer in both zigzag and armchair directions are calculated, and the rectangular supercell is used with armchair and zigzag being defined as x and y directions in Fig. 1. The calculated effective masses for electrons and holes with GGA and GGA+SOC are shown in Table 2. It is found that the effective masses for electrons between GGA and GGA+SOC are very close, but those for holes are very different. This can be explained from their energy structures in Fig. 3. When including SOC, the bands near CBM have little change with respect to the GGA results, but the flat bands around VBM disappear. Thus, it is very important for calculating effective masses of holes to consider SOC. The DP constant El is calculated by linearly fitting the band energies of the VBM and CBM with respect to the vacuum energy as a function of Δx/x and Δy/y, which is plotted in Fig. 6. On the basis of the calculated effective mass, elastic constant, and deformation potential constant, the carrier mobility and relaxation time for the electrons and holes of monolayer SnSSe along x and y directons are calculated, which are shown Table 2. Predicted carrier mobilities between electrons and holes show very strong anisotropy, and the weakly anisotropic ones along x and y directions for the same carrier type are observed. The hole carrier mobilities of SnSSe monolayer are higher than those of monolayer SnS2 (187.44 cm2 V−1 s−1) and SnSe2 (115.65 cm2 V−1 s−1),48 but its electron carrier mobilities are lower than their ones. The calculated τ is useful for attaining the electronic transport coefficients of SnSSe monolayer.

VI. Piezoelectric properties
In noncentrosymmetric materials, the piezoelectric effect can be produced, when mechanical stress is applied. In 2D materials, the third-rank piezoelectric stress tensors eijk and strain tensor dijk, employing Voigt notation, can be connected by the elastic tensor:14 e = dC(6) (7) (8) (9)By performing symmetry analysis, the number of independent tensor coefficients can be further reduced. Due to a 3m point-group symmetry of SnSSe monolayer, the piezoelectric stress and strain tensors, and elastic tensor become: (10) (11) (12)
Here, d11 and d31 are derived by eqn (6) and (10)–(12): (13)
The nonprimitive orthorhombic unit cell of SnSSe monolayer (Fig. 1) is used as the computational unit cell for eij. The calculated eij and dij of SnSSe monolayer are shown in Table 3, along with those of the already synthesized MoSSe monolayer. Calculated results show that the piezoelectric coefficients of SnSSe are lower than those of MoSSe. However, d11 is comparable with that of α-quartz (d11 = 2.27 pm V−1),63 a commonly used 3D piezoelectric material. It is noted that SnS2 and SnSe2 monolayers display inversion symmetry and therefore no piezoelectricity.

VII. Optical properties
The optical properties of the SnSSe monolayer can be described by the complex dielectric function ε(ω), the imaginary part ε2(ω) of which is determined by a summation over empty band states as follows:64 (14)where ε0, Ω and ħω are the vacuum dielectric constant, the volume and the energy of the incident phonon; v, c and u represent the valence bands, conduction bands and the polarization vector in the incident electric field; u.r and ψk are the momentum operator and the wave function at the k point. The real part ε1(ω) of the dielectric tensor can be obtained by the Kramers–Kronig relation. According to the dielectric function, the absorption coefficient α(ω) can be given using the following equation:65 (15)
Here, we use the rhombus primitive cell to investigate the optical properties of monolayer SnSSe. It is noted that the unit-cell volume Ω is not well-defined for 2D materials, and their optical properties depend on the length of unit cell along the z direction.46 The dielectric function and absorption coefficient of SnSSe monolayer are calculated along xx/yy and zz directions, and are plotted in Fig. 7 and 8.
 Fig. 7  Using GGA+SOC, calculated optical dielectric function of monolayer SnSSe, including real parts (top) and imaginary parts (bottom) along xx/yy and zz directions. 
 Fig. 8  Using GGA+SOC, the optical absorption coefficients of SnSSe monolayer along xx/yy and zz directions from 0 eV to 12 eV (top) and from 0 eV to 3.5 eV (bottom), and the visible light region (1.6–3.1 eV) is shown. 
Along xx/yy and zz directions, strong anisotropy in the optical spectra can be observed due to distinct optical selection rules. In the low frequency region, ε1(ω) along the xx/yy direction is higher than that along the zz direction. ε2(ω) along the xx/yy direction shows a sharp increase at about 1.18 eV at the first onset of the optical transitions, which is lower than the one (2.00 eV) along the zz direction. The main peak region of ε2(ω) along the xx/yy direction centres around 4 eV, and 6.3 eV along the zz direction. From the ultraviolet to the visible light region, strong absorption intensity can be observed along the xx/yy direction, and the absorption coefficient values reach up to more than 104 cm−1 in the visible light region, implying high efficiency in the utilization of solar energy. The absorption intensity along the zz direction is lower than that along the xx/yy direction in the visible light region. However, the very strong absorption intensity along the zz direction is observed around 6.5 eV, which is higher than that along the xx/yy direction.
VIII. Electronic transport properties
Based on CSTA Boltzmann theory within the rigid band approach (RBA), the electronic transport coefficients of SnSSe monolayer are calculated. To simulate the doping effects, the n(p)-type doping is achieved by simply moving the position of Fermi level into conduction (valence) bands within RBA. Here, the rhombus primitive cell is used to investigate the electronic transport properties of SnSSe monolayer, and the studied transport direction corresponds to the zigzag (y) direction of the rectangle supercell. The Seebeck coefficient S is independent of relaxation time τ, and the room temperature S as a function of doping level (N) is shown in Fig. 9 with both GGA and GGA+SOC. The SOC can reduce p-type S of SnSSe monolayer, and it has little effect on S in n-type doping, which can be understood by considering SOC effects on the bands around the Fermi level. One reason is that the SOC can remove the valence band degeneracy near the VBM, leading to reduced p-type S. Another reason is that the SOC can reduce the effective masses of VBM (from Table 2), producing a detrimental S in p-type doping due to: (16)where m*, T and n are the effective mass of the carrier, temperature and carrier concentration, respectively. Thus, it is very important for electronic transport studies to consider SOC. It is noted that the calculated electrical conductivity σ/τ and power factor S2σ/τ depend on τ. By using calculated τ from Table 2, the room temperature σ and S2σ as a function of N are shown in Fig. 10, using GGA+SOC. For n-type doping, τ = 2.99 × 10−14 s, and τ = 1.14 × 10−13 s in p-type doping. Calculated results show that SnSSe monolayer has very excellent S2σ. Ultra low lattice thermal conductivity in monolayer SnS2 or SnSe2 has been predicted from a first principles study.48 The lattice thermal conductivity of Janus MoSSe/PtSSe/ZrSSe monolayer is lower than that of MoS2/PtS2/ZrS2 monolayer.30–32 Thus, the SnSSe monolayer should have ultra low lattice thermal conductivity, which suggests that Janus monolayer SnSSe may be a potential thermoelectric material. Finally, the power factor S2σ of SnSSe monolayer as a function of temperature with a series of doping levels in both p- and n-type doping are plotted in Fig. 11 using GGA+SOC. It is found that n-type doping is suitable for thermoelectric applications in the low temperature area, while p-type doping is suitable for the medium temperature region.

IX. Discussions and conclusion
Monolayer SnX2 (X = S, Se) materials have recently been synthesized,6,7 and Janus TMD monolayer MoSSe with a sandwiched S–Mo–Se structure has also been synthesized by replacing the top S atomic layer in MoS2 with Se atoms.5,21 Thus, it is possible to achieve Janus SnSSe monolayer by replacing the top S (Se) atomic layer in SnS2 (SnSe2) with Se (S) atoms. In fact, growing Janus SnSTe and SnSeTe monolayers is also possible. Compared to SnS2 and SnSe2 monolayers, the most important difference is that Janus SnXY (X/Y = S, Se, Te) monolayer breaks inversion symmetry, and therefore piezoelectricity can be produced. In addition to this, the electronic structures, phonons, elastic properties, optical properties and transport properties of SnS2 and SnSe2 monolayers can be tuned by constructing Janus monolayers. It has been proved that SnS2 and SnSe2 monolayers have ultra low lattice thermal conductivities, due to the low phonon velocity, low Debye temperature, weak bonding interactions and strong anharmonicity.48 The Janus SnXY (X/Y = S, Se, Te) monolayer should also have ultra low lattice thermal conductivity, and it may be a promising candidate for thermoelectric applications. Finally, the energy bands of SnSSe monolayer with HSE+SOC are calculated, which are shown in Fig. S4 of the ESI.† The HSE+SOC gap is 1.46 eV, which is larger than 0.83 eV using GGA+SOC.
In summary, the electronic structures, carrier mobilities, piezoelectric properties, optical properties and transport coefficients of Janus SnSSe monolayer are systematically studied using reliable first-principles calculations. Janus monolayer SnSSe with 1T phase is found to exhibit mechanical and dynamic stability and high experimental feasibility. Calculated results show that SnSSe monolayer is an indirect gap semiconductor, and the SOC can produce important influences on energy band structures, effective masses of VBM and electronic transport coefficients of Janus SnSSe monolayer. The hole mobilities of monolayer SnSSe are higher than the electron ones, and are also higher than those of monolayer SnS2 or SnSe2.48 The piezoelectric coefficient d11 of SnSSe monolayer is comparable with that of α-quartz, a commonly used 3D piezoelectric material.63 The high absorption coefficients in the visible light region can be observed along the xx/yy direction. The electronic transport calculations suggest that Janus monolayer SnSSe may be a potential thermoelectric material. Our works can stimulate further experimental works to synthesize SnSSe monolayer, and will motivate further studies of other Janus monolayers, such as SnSTe and SnSeTe monolayers.
