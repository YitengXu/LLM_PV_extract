    , Accepted 21st July 2016First published on 21st July 2016AbstractDouble perovskites LaSrCoFeO6−δ (LSCF) and LaSrCoFeO6−δ with a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous structure (3DOM-LSCF) were successfully synthesized by a facile combustion process. Their crystal structure, morphology, BET surface area, band gap and catalytic properties were characterized in detail. Phase pure double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF can be obtained by calcination at 550–950 °C for 4 h. The ordered and interconnected pore structure generated by using a PMMA template can be maintained successfully in the 3DOM-LSCF catalyst. Both catalysts had good catalytic performance in either CH4 selectivity or total yield. Production of CH4 from CO2 and H2O can reach 351.32 μmol g−1 for LSCF and 557.88 μmol g−1 for 3DOM-LSCF under photothermal conditions (350 °C + vis-light) in 8 h. The high solar-to-methane (STM) energy conversion efficiency was 1.217% for LSCF and 1.933% for 3DOM-LSCF in the photothermal mode. The results also show that the yield of CH4 in the photothermal mode is 5 times that in the thermal reduction mode. The double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF are promising catalytic materials for the photothermal reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbon fuels.
Introduction
The rapid development of industries has been accompanied by increasing concentrations of atmospheric pollutants. Global warming caused by emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere is widely regarded as one of the most severe environmental issues of recent years. The atmospheric concentration of CO2 has gradually increased mainly owing to human activities.1 Besides, thermal pollution is also the most current pollution and it is a result of large-scale industrialization. The extremely large amounts of waste heat will be useful if it can be harvested and used for sustainable energy generation. In addition, as we know, solar energy can be used not only for thermal power generation, but also for chemical manufacture.2 The discovery of new cost-effective and highly active catalysts for direct energy conversion using solar energy, transforming CO2 and heat emission into hydrocarbon fuels and storage is of prime importance to address climate change challenges and develop storage options for renewable energies.
Photocatalysis, as an efficient, green, and promising solution to the current energy crisis and environmental deterioration, has attracted considerable interest. In general, the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 is a possible avenue to convert CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels, because reducing the amount of CO2 will not only meet the purpose of environmental protection but also provide raw materials for the chemical industry. Since Halmann discovered the photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 into organic compounds in 1978 (ref. 3) and Hiroshi and co-workers reported the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into organic compounds over suspending semiconductor particles in water,4 growing interest in the development of semiconductor photocatalysts has evolved. The present invention combines photo, thermal, electric and chemical processes to develop a new method, maximizing the efficiency and the conversion rate of thermal radiation to chemical potential, in the form of CO2 reduction to CO, C and O2 and H2O reduction to H2 and O2 in the same system. The dissociation of CO2 and H2O may occur in the same system simultaneously or either one of them can be performed alone. Photothermal catalysis, which combines photo and thermal reaction conditions to reduce CO2 with H2O vapor to form CH4, has received more attention.2,20 In our previous study we have shown that the photothermal process has improved catalytic performance better than reduction of CO2 with H2O vapor to CH4 under thermal-only conditions.20 The photothermal catalytic process was good as it combined the advantages of the photochemical and thermochemical catalytic processes, while promoting and supporting them together in the one reaction system to provide high efficiency and reaction rate.
To date, many kinds of photocatalysts have been investigated as catalysts for CO2 reduction.3,5–9 For heterogeneous photocatalysts, many efforts are still focused on TiO2-based6,8,10,11 materials while other catalysts such as SrTiO3,12 Zn2GeO4,13 ZnGa2O4,14 CaFe2O4,15 ALa4Ti4O15 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba),16 NiO/InTaO4,17 BiVO4,18 ZnO@Cu–Zn–Al,19 WO3,20 NaNbO3 (ref. 21) and so forth have also been reported. Among them, perovskite oxides with a general formula ABO3 possess unique properties, such as the metal–insulator transition, spin blockade, colossal magnetoresistance, ferroelectricity, and superconductivity, which make them attractive in technological applications such as electrocatalysis, catalysis, sensor devices, magnetoresistance devices, and spintronics.22–24 Perovskite-type La1−xSrxCo1−yFeyO3−δ oxides with mixed electronic and ionic conductivities are mainly known as good candidates for cathode materials used in solid oxide fuel cells25 and for membrane materials with high oxygen permeability as well as phase/chemical stability.26 La1−xSrxCo1−yFeyO3−δ, as powders intended for membrane reactors, were found to exhibit excellent catalytic properties for the partial oxidation of natural gas.25 They also act as highly efficient catalysts towards methane and propane combustion,27 toluene combustion,28 methanol decomposition to CO and H2,29 VOC combustion,30 and in automobile exhaust systems and gas sensors.31 La1−xSrxCo1−yFeyO3−δ perovskites possess oxygen vacancies,32–35 which may act as Lewis acid sites necessary for the reaction of phenol catalytic alkylation.36 In addition, double perovskite oxides with a general formula AA′BB′O6 or A2BB′O6 (where A and A′ are alkaline-earth and/or rare-earth metals and B and B′ are transition metals) have been widely investigated for their catalytic, magnetic, and dielectric properties and colossal magnetoresistance (CMR).37,38 After the discovery of room temperature CMR and tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) in double perovskites Sr2FeMoO6 and Sr2FeReO6, respectively,39,40 there has been growing interest worldwide in searching for effective methods to synthesize double perovskite materials.41–43 Unfortunately, traditional methods involve high-temperature solid-state reactions, leading to the destruction of porous structures and hence to low surface areas, unfavorable for the enhancement of the catalytic performance of the obtained perovskite materials. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop an effective strategy for the controlled preparation of porous perovskite materials that have a large surface area. Recently, this problem has been solved using the colloidal crystal templating method, by which one can create a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) structure. Perovskite-type oxides with a 3DOM structure possess relatively large surface areas, high thermal stability, and good catalytic performance.44,45 The unique ordered macroporous structure can provide easy mass transfer of reactant molecules, facile accessibility to active sites, and convenient loading of active components.46 Therefore, 3DOM-structured ABO3 is considered to be one of the most promising catalytic materials.47–49 Therefore, we report the preparation, characterization, and comparison of the catalytic properties of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF for the thermal and photothermal reduction of CO2 with H2O vapor to CH4. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of temperature on the morphology, crystal structure, band gap, catalytic performance and thermal and photothermal reaction mechanisms of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF for the CO2 reduction.
In a typical experiment, double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF were prepared by a convenient and efficient modified combustion process. The samples were calcined in air for 4 h at different temperatures between 550 and 950 °C. The 3DOM-LSCF catalyst with a well-defined 3DOM structure could be prepared using a PMMA template. The catalytic experiments were carried out in a gas-closed circulation system. The volume of the reaction system was about 150 mL. The evaluation of catalytic activity was performed at 150, 250, and 350 °C without light (thermal) and 350 °C with visible light (photothermal); the light source used was a 300 W Xe lamp with a UV-light filter (λ > 420 nm). Samples were taken every hour and quantitative analysis was performed on GS-Tek (Echromtek A90) equipment with a capillary column. The quantification of the CH4 product yield was based on the external standard and the use of calibration curves (ESI S1†).
Results and discussion
The prepared double perovskite LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF powders were calcined in air for 4 h at different temperatures between 550 and 950 °C to investigate the evolution of crystalline phases. X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the heat-treated double perovskite LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF powders are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The diffraction peaks of two samples are in good agreement with the standard file, which corresponds to the pure perovskite phase with a cubic system (space group Pmm, ref. code 01-089-5720). All the characteristic diffraction peaks, which belong to the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF, are observed in the patterns of all the samples indicating that the obtained catalysts possessed an AA′BB′O6 double perovskite-type structure with a disordered cubic structure. Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of LSCF calcined in air at 750 °C for 4 h with diffraction peaks at 2θ = 22.97°, 32.77°, 40.41°, 47.04°, 52.96°, 58.52°, 68.73°, 73.57°, and 78.25°, which could be perfectly indexed to the (1 0 0), (1 1 0), (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 1 0), (2 1 1), (2 2 0), (3 0 0), and (3 1 0) crystal faces of double perovskites, respectively. Fig. 1b shows the XRD pattern of 3DOM-LSCF calcined under the same conditions with diffraction peaks at 2θ = 23.10°, 32.81°, 40.47°, 47.10°, 53.10°, 58.59°, 68.84°, 73.60°, and 78.38°, which could be perfectly indexed to the (1 0 0), (1 1 0), (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 1 0), (2 1 1), (2 2 0), (3 0 0), and (3 1 0) crystal faces of double perovskites, respectively. In the XRD pattern of 3DOM-LSCF, the main peak indexed to the (1 1 0) crystal face shifted to a higher angle than that of the peak of LSCF, which means that the lattice parameters of 3DOM-LSCF decrease and diffraction peaks move to the high angle side. Furthermore, the diffraction peaks shifted to a higher angle, showed higher intensity and became sharper with increasing temperature, indicating that the perovskite crystal structure is affected by temperature. The crystallite size of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF also increased with increasing temperature. This has affected the surface electronic structure and electrical transport properties of the catalysts. The results of Rietveld structure refinement for the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF are summarized in Table 1. The stability of complex perovskite structures can be well explained with the use of tolerance factors (t). For the materials studied here, the tolerance factors can be determined by eqn (1): (1)where rLa, rSr, rCo, rFe and rO are the ionic radii of La, Sr, Co, Fe and O ions, respectively.51,52 Shannon's ionic radii52 are frequently employed to determine the tolerance factors. Hines et al. suggested (solely by analysis of the tolerance factor) that the perovskite will be cubic if 0.9 < t < 1.0 and orthorhombic if 0.75 < t < 0.9.53 For the double perovskite LaSrCoFeO6−δ, the tolerance factor is 0.9785, which has the cubic structure. According to the XRD patterns, the double perovskite LaSrCoFeO6−δ crystal structure is cubic and it was modelled as shown in Fig. 1c (super cell) and Fig. 1d for one cell, with a lattice constant of 3.86 Å. Moreover, earlier investigation of synthesis of LSCF by a solid-state reaction method indicated that the perovskite phase was formed after calcination at 1200 °C for 6 h.50 The products calcined at this temperature will have low porosity and a non-ideal microstructure. In this study, the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF were obtained in pure phase at a lower temperature and in a short time. Therefore, in this method the prepared perovskite using a PMMA template had good phase purity and high porosity which are promising for great catalytic performance.

The specific surface areas, porous structures, and size distributions of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF are characterized by using nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K on a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 HD88 system (Fig. 2). It is seen that the two samples show a mesoporous structure. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms can be classified as type IV isotherms, typical of mesoporous materials. According to the IUPAC classification, the hysteresis loop is type H3.54 This type of hysteresis is usually found for solids consisting of aggregates or agglomerates of particles forming slit shaped pores, with a non-uniform size and/or shape. The BET specific surface area of the 3DOM-LSCF is 21.68 m2 g−1 which is 2.6 times higher than 8.46 m2 g−1 of the LSCF and characteristic of mesoporous double perovskite 3DOM-LSCF with an adsorption average Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore width of 17.50 nm and a total pore volume of 0.095 cm3 g−1. The result also shows that the BET surface area and the total pore volume of 3DOM-LSCF are much higher than those of LSCF. The high BET surface area and large total pore volume strongly support the fact that the 3DOM-LSCF has a mesoporous structure. The enlarged specific surface area would create more reaction sites to facilitate the access of reactants. It is reasonable to believe that the 3DOM-LSCF would be more favorable for the improvement of the reaction activity of the photothermal reduction of CO2 with H2O vapor to CH4 than double perovskite LSCF synthesized without a PMMA template.

The morphologies of the PMMA template, and the prepared double perovskites LSCF at 750 °C and 3DOM-LSCF at different temperatures for 4 h in air were observed by SEM. Fig. 3a and b show the SEM images of the colloidal crystal template assembled by PMMA microspheres. It can be seen that the template is uniform and orderly with a particle size of 720 nm. In the preparation process of the PMMA template, Bragg diffraction will occur by the orderly array in the visible wavelength range. A clear color change can be observed for the obtained colloidal crystal template while changing the viewing angle, which is the typical diffraction behaviour of an orderly array. The appearance of the Bragg diffraction phenomenon also demonstrates the good order and uniform assembly of the template.

The synthesis route to double perovskite 3DOM-LSCF is shown schematically in Scheme 1 and details can be found in ESI S1.† The SEM images of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3, all samples had highly porous, agglomerated structures with an estimated particle size between 50 and 120 nm; the small particle sizes might lead to higher catalytic activity for CO2 conversion. From the SEM images in Fig. 3e–l, it could be seen that all the 3DOM-LSCF catalysts obtained by the colloidal crystal template method have the 3DOM structure. All the PMMA colloidal templates were completely removed after calcination at 550 °C and this temperature did not affect the formation of the 3DOM structure. The macropores in the structure of 3DOM-LSCF are almost ordered, have a hemispherical shape and connected with each other through small windows. Their pore sizes estimated from the SEM image are about 450–550 nm, which correspond to a shrinkage of 23.6–37.5% compared with the initial sizes of PMMA microspheres of about 720 nm. This shrinkage is caused by melting of the microspheres and sintering of the produced perovskite-type compound. Nevertheless, the long-range orderly and uniform porous structure of the 3DOM-LSCF catalyst is not destroyed by this large shrinkage. The wall thickness of the macroporous double perovskite 3DOM-LSCF catalyst estimated from the SEM images is about 100–150 nm. The wall seems to be composed of linearly fused grains of the produced perovskite-type compound. Three small windows in the macropores formed as a result of the contact between the PMMA microspheres template removed after calcination could be seen. These interconnected macropores are favorable for the internal part of 3DOM materials to exchange substances outside. Through SEM analysis results, it could be seen that the 3DOM structure of 3DOM-LSCF is deformed and broken when the temperature is higher than 850 °C. Thus, combined with the XRD analysis results, the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF prepared at 750 °C with a good morphology and fine crystalline phase were selected for thermal and photothermal catalytic performance.

To get more detailed information on the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF, TEM images are presented in Fig. 4. From the TEM images of Fig. 4a, b, d and e, it could be seen that the small nanoparticles with an average size of 50–120 nm were aligned together. From Fig. 4d and e, it is obvious that 3DOM-LSCF possessed a high-quality 3DOM structure which was composed of interconnected macropores with nanocrystal skeletons, in good agreement with the SEM observations. The wall thickness of the 3DOM-LSCF is in the range of 100–200 nm. Besides, there were nanovoids with a diameter of 20–30 nm, which were randomly distributed on the walls of the macropores. Moreover, the TEM images in Fig. 4c and f also show clear lattice spacing (d values) of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF. The interplanar spacings of (1 1 0) of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF were 0.273 nm and 0.272 nm, respectively, corresponding to the (1 1 0) lattice spacing of the cubic phase of the perovskite crystal structure, which were the same as XRD Rietveld structure refinement results for double perovskite LaSrCoFeO6−δ. However, the interplanar spacing of (1 1 0) planes of 3DOM-LSCF is smaller than that of the LSCF sample.

A Bruker-AXS 133 eV XFlash 4010 detector attached to the SEM is used to measure the elemental composition and distribution of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF. From the EDS spectrum and the elemental mapping images in Fig. 4g and h, it is clearly seen that the elements La, Sr, Fe, Co and O dominate the composition of the double perovskite LaSrCoFeO6−δ. These mapping images are solid proofs that the La, Sr, Fe, Co and O are uniformly distributed in the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF.
Optical properties are one of the most important properties of any material for the evaluation of its photocatalytic activity. Fig. 6a shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF. The double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF had good light absorption properties in both ultraviolet and visible light regions. Hence, the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF can exhibit photocatalytic activity under UV light and visible light. The lower cut-off wavelength of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF was observed at 436 nm and 439 nm, respectively. No other peak related to impurities and structural defects was observed in the spectra which confirms that the synthesized crystals have good crystallinity. Furthermore, band gap energy was calculated on the basis of the maximum absorption band of the crystal and found to be 2.84 eV and 2.83 eV for the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF, respectively (Fig. 5a). As shown in Fig. 5b and c, the Mott–Schottky measurements were performed to determine the relative positions of the CB and VB edges. The positive slope of the plot revealed typical n-type characteristics of semiconductors.55 As for n-type semiconductors, the flat-band potentials (Efb) can be used to approximately estimate the CB potentials (ECB).56,57 The ECB values of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF were about −0.41 and −0.86 V, respectively. Based on the above results and the band gap energy obtained by DRS, the VB potentials (EVB) were calculated to be +2.43 V and +1.97 V for the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF, respectively (Fig. 5d). These results clearly confirm that the ECB and EVB of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF are suitable for CO2 photoreduction. The edge of the VB of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF was more positive than Eo(H2O/H+) (H2O → 1/2O2 + 2H+ + 2e−, Eoox = 0.82 V vs. NHE) (Fig. 5d). The edge of the CB was thus estimated to be −0.42 V, which is more negative than Eo(CO2/CH4) (CO2 + 8e− + 8H+ → CH4 + 2H2O, Eored = −0.24 V vs. NHE). This indicates that the photogenerated electrons and holes in the irradiated double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF can react with adsorbed CO2 and H2O to produce CH4, as described in the following equation: CO2 + H2O → CH4 + O2.58 Moreover, the color of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF is black, which indicates that these catalysts could absorb more visible light and would exhibit higher photocatalytic efficiency.

XPS was performed in order to study the chemical state and surface composition of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF (Fig. 6a–d). Table 2 reports the binding energies of elements constituting the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF. As shown in Fig. 6a and b the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF with both Fe and Co regions show the evidence of the coexistence of at least two oxidation states and had the same results.59–61 In the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF, the B position is occupied by iron or cobalt, in the two oxidation states 2+ and 3+ whose relative amount could be estimated only for the ion present at higher concentration. The Fe 2p peak fitting of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF was performed according to the constraints of the Fe2+ and Fe3+ components and the respective shake-up satellites indicated by Liu.62 Both catalysts show the two oxidation states characterized by the components at 709.99 and 713.61 eV of Fe2+ and Fe3+ respectively for LSCF and 709.90 and 713.49 eV of Fe2+ and Fe3+ respectively for 3DOM-LSCF. The high binding energy of the second component of iron in the figure is attributed to Fe3+, which could also account for the presence of the small amount of Fe4+.71 Analogously, the Co 2p region was fitted with the Co2+, Co3+ and the respective shake-up satellites.59,60 In the case of cobalt, the Co2+ component is located at higher binding energy than the Co3+. As shown in Fig. 6 the binding energy values of Co 2p (Co2+) are obtained at 781.38 eV and 779.77 eV for LCSF and 783.08 eV and 779.90 eV for the 3DOM-LCSF catalyst.59Fig. 6c shows the experimental and fitted O 1s photoelectron spectra of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF. The O 1s peaks typical of all catalysts consist of three components at about 528.37, 530.65 and 532.19 eV attributed to lattice, surface and adsorbed oxygen, respectively.61 The thermal and photothermal catalytic activities for CO2 conversion with H2O vapor to CH4 over double perovskite LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF catalysts have been compared and it has been shown that the catalytic activity toward this reaction depends on Co3+/Co2+, Fe3+/Fe2+, and Oads/Olattice ratios and exposure of lattice planes of the catalysts.61,63

At the same time, the BE values of La 3d5/2 and Sr 3d5/2 of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF (Fig. 6d) no more differ. Considering the basic characteristics of the perovskite surface one should take into account that in the ABO3 structure, lattice oxygen anions have only two coordinations with small and strongly polarizing B cations and they are only weakly polarized by big A cations. When chemisorbed oxygen species (oxygen ions) lie on the perovskite surface they are coordinatively unsaturated and their coordination with B is lowered to one.36 So, one could expect that if the relative concentrations of La and Sr at the A position and Co and Fe at the B position are different, the formal charge of the oxygen species chemisorbed on this surface will also be different. Moreover, XPS analysis results confirmed that the double perovskite LaSrCoFeO6−δ with mixed ions and mixed valence states of A, A′-site (La3+/Sr2+) and B, B′-site (Co2+/Co3+, Fe2+/Fe3+) possesses self-formed oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancies in the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF could be controlled by changing the crystal structure, A, A′, B, B′ sites, molar ratios of elements and the 3DOM structure of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF.
The thermal and photothermal catalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 with H2O vapor to CH4 over double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF catalysts was evaluated under thermal-only conditions at 150, 250, and 350 °C and photothermal conditions (350 °C + vis-light) (Fig. 7 and Table 3). Fig. 7a and b show comparison of the catalytic activity of thermal reduction at different temperatures of 150, 250, and 350 °C and the photothermal reduction of CO2 with H2O vapor to CH4 over double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF catalysts. The yield, turn over number (TON) and solar-to-methane (STM) energy conversion efficiency of the thermal and photothermal reduction of CO2 with H2O vapor to CH4 over double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF catalysts are summarized in Tables 4 and 5 (ESI S3†). Fig. 7a and b show that increasing the temperature greatly increased the thermal catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 7a and b after 8 h, the methane production yields of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF are in the order of 350 °C + vis-light > 350 °C > 250 °C > 150 °C. The detailed values of the catalytic performance under photothermal conditions after 8 h were found to be 557.88, 120.86, 39.02, and 2.81 μmol g−1 for 3DOM-LSCF and 351.32, 65.88, 24.94 and 1.89 μmol g−1 for LSCF. Fig. 7b shows that the yield of methane over the 3DOM-LSCF catalyst under photothermal conditions after 8 h (557.88 μmol g−1) is about 1.6 times that of the LSCF catalyst (351.32 μmol g−1). The results also show that the best catalytic performance is achieved under photothermal conditions and it is 5 times higher than the catalytic performance under thermal-only conditions. The results may depend on the comparative surface area, pore volume, and crystallite size.63–65 The band gap energy is also correlated with the photocatalytic activity. The double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF have a similar band gap but the 3DOM-LSCF catalyst has the positions of the CB and VB more suitable for CO2 photoreduction than the LSCF catalyst. It has a more negative CB and less positive VB than the LSCF catalyst. In addition, the BET specific surface area of the 3DOM-LSCF catalyst is 21.86 m2 g−1, which is larger than the BET specific surface area of 8.46 m2 g−1 of the LSCF catalyst. In addition, the high catalytic performance of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF may depend on the photo-thermal coupling effect, self-formed oxygen vacancies, small crystallite size and highly porous materials. Furthermore, the 3DOM-LSCF may possess self-formed heterostructures with a 3DOM structure all playing positive roles in the separation process of photogenerated electrons and holes. In such a way, the presence of the heterostructure interface effectively suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, and the photocatalytic activity is greatly enhanced.

The reusability of the catalyst is important for its practical applications. In order to evaluate the activity stability of the catalyst, reusability experiments were carried out. From Fig. 7c, it can be seen that the catalytic activity of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF remains high after reusing 5 times and the catalytic activity of the 3DOM-LSCF catalyst is better than that of the LSCF catalyst. The double perovskite 3DOM-LSCF has shown considerable stability in the catalytic process.
In addition, it is difficult to directly compare the methane production rate of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF with rates reported for other photocatalysts because of the variance in experimental conditions (such as light intensity, illumination area, and photocatalyst dosage), morphological features, surface areas, and co-catalysts. However, the catalytic performance of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF is comparable to and perhaps better than that of other reported photocatalysts that convert CO2 into methane using solar irradiation and without using noble metal co-catalysts, as shown in Table 6 (ESI S3†).
The reaction mechanism of the thermal and photothermal reduction of CO2 with H2O vapor to CH4 over double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF catalysts was proposed based on previous studies20,66,67 and is illustrated in Fig. 9. The rate of photocatalytic reaction can be controlled by several steps: photoexcitation of the double perovskite LaSrCoFeO6−δ surface, creating electron–hole pairs, followed by their transfer to CO2 and H2O. The surface defects and hydration are often considered to be important for heterogeneous catalysis as well, since these particular factors also play important roles in the reactant–surface binding and the formation of bonds between the surface atoms and H2O and CO2 molecules. To correlate surface structures with photocatalytic activity, interaction between H2O and CO2 molecules and the surface of the photocatalyst was examined.68–73 An understanding of the interaction between the catalyst surface and the CO2 and H2O molecules is vital for developing its role in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The CO2 and H2O molecules could be adsorbed on the double perovskite LaSrCoFeO6−δ surface. A variety of possible binding configurations of H2O and CO2 on the perfect and defective catalyst surfaces in terms of geometries, energies, and net charges were explored. Five models were constructed to determine the adsorption energy of the system (Fig. 8). Li Liu and co-workers70,71 showed that the adsorbed CO2 molecules are partially negatively charged, indicating that CO2 accepted electrons from the surface and formed a partially and negatively charged CO2δ− species. This negatively charged CO2δ− intermediate has also been described in experimental74,75 and theoretical work.76,77 For defective surfaces, surface oxygen defects were found to play an important role and can significantly influence the interaction of CO2 with the surface: the oxygen vacancies are the active sites on the defective surfaces; the nearby oxygen vacancies can significantly enhance the adsorption energy of CO2 molecules compared to perfect surfaces; CO2 can not only be activated but can also be further dissociated into CO and O at the surface oxygen defect site and the oxygen vacancy defect can be healed by the oxygen atom released during the dissociation process. Through analysis of the dissociative adsorption mechanism of CO2 on defective surfaces, the results show that the dissociative adsorption of CO2 favours the stepwise dissociation mechanism and the dissociation process can be described in eqn (2): CO2 + Vo → CO2δ−/Vo → COadsorbed + Osurface(2)

Furthermore, H2O adsorbed on perfect surfaces could spontaneously dissociate into an H atom and an OH group. The presence of oxygen defects was found to strongly promote H2O dissociation on the (0 1 0) surface. The results revealed that the interaction of CO2 and H2O with catalyst surfaces was dependent on the structure, crystal plane and active sites on the surfaces.70,71
In order to understand the reaction process, a possible catalytic mechanism of the double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF for the reduction of CO2 with H2O vapor to CH4 is shown in Fig. 9 and equations. The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O vapor on semiconductor oxide catalyst surfaces using solar energy to yield fuels/chemicals (CH4, CH3OH, etc.) involves two major steps, splitting of H2O to yield H2, which in turn helps in the reduction of CO2 to different hydrocarbon products in the second step. The complex sequences of process steps that follow, involving two, four, six or eight electrons for reduction, lead to the formation of formic acid/CO, formaldehyde, methanol and methane respectively7 depending on the type of catalyst and reaction conditions employed.
The first step involving the photocatalytic splitting of water follows the well-accepted elementary steps as shown in eqn (3)–(8): LaSrCoFeO6−δ + hν → e− + h+(3) H2Oads + h+ → OH− + H+(4) H+ + e− → ˙H(5) OH− + h+ → ˙OH(6) 2˙OH → H2O2 + h+ → O2− + 2H+(7) O2− + h+ → O2(8)
The second step for the activation and reduction of CO2 to CH4 could then follow20,67,78,79 the steps shown in eqn (9)–(14): CO2ads + e− → ˙CO2−(9) ˙CO2− + ˙H → CO + OH−(10) CO + e− → ˙CO−(11) ˙CO− + ˙H → ˙C + OH−(12) ˙C + H+ + e− → ˙CH → ˙CH2 → ˙CH3(13) ˙CH3 + H+ + e− → CH4(14)
A possible thermocatalysis mechanism for the activation and reduction of CO2 to CH4 is shown in eqn (15)–(19) and the total reaction under photothermal coupling is shown in eqn (20): LaSrCoFeO6−δ + H2O → LaSrCoFeO6 + H2(15) LaSrCoFeO6−δ + δ/2CO2 → LaSrCoFeO6 + δ/2C(s) (high Vo)(16) LaSrCoFeO6−δ + CO2 → LaSrCoFeO6 + CO (low Vo)(17)
Vo (oxygen vacancies) CO + H2 → C + H2O(18) C + 2H2 → CH4(19)
The total reaction under photo-thermal coupling CO2 + 2H2O → CH4 + 2O2(20)
Tabata and co-worker80 reported that CO2 could be decomposed completely to carbon with oxygen-deficient ferrites and Zn(II), Mn(II) and Ni(II) bearing ferrites81–84 at low temperature near 300 °C. In this study, with water as a hydrogen source and under optimized reaction conditions, the double perovskite LaSrCoFeO6−δ with self-formed oxygen vacancies could split H2O into the H element below 350 °C. The combination of the two splitting reactions improved the conversion of CO2 to CH4 with high selectivity and high yield. High CH4 selectivity was due to the splitting of CO2 tending to form more C (eqn (16)) as the single intermediate product under low temperature (<500 °C) conditions. Moreover, when temperature increases, the electrical conductivity increases,85,86 which means that the yield of CH4 is affected by the electrical conductivity of catalysts. Furthermore, the high temperature improved the mass transfer and reaction kinetics. Usually conducting a reaction at a higher temperature delivers more energy into the system and increases the reaction rate because of more collisions between particles. However, the main reason for the increase of the rate of reaction with increasing temperature is that more of the colliding particles will have the necessary activation energy resulting in more successful collisions. The simultaneous thermochemical reaction of CO2 and H2O with the oxygen deficient double perovskite LaSrCoFeO6−δ at a relatively low temperature can convert CO2 into CH4 with high efficiency as well as solve the problem of catalytic carbon deposition whereby the catalyst surface might be covered by a carbon layer in the catalytic reaction process. The generated carbon from the splitting of CO2 will react with the H element to convert into CH4 (eqn (19)). Thus, CO2 can be converted to CH4 through the two reaction steps by oxygen vacancies. In summary, we demonstrate the simultaneous thermochemical reaction of CO2 and H2O with the oxygen deficient double perovskite LaSrCoFeO6−δ catalyst at a relatively low temperature to achieve highly efficient conversion of CO2 into CH4. The exploration of these catalysts with oxygen vacancies confirmed that the transformation of CO2 into CH4 was achieved by active oxygen vacancies. The repeatability of the catalyst decreased because of the decrease of the oxygen vacancy concentration.
Conclusions
Double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF were successfully synthesized by a convenient and efficient modified combustion process. The 3DOM-LSCF catalyst with a 3DOM structure could be prepared using a PMMA template. Their crystal structure, morphology, BET surface area, band gap and catalytic properties were characterized in detail. Phase pure double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF were produced after calcination at 550–950 °C for 4 h. The slow light effect of the 3DOM structure can enhance the absorption efficiency of solar irradiation. Moreover, the 3DOM-LSCF with self-doped and self-formed heterostructures can effectively extend its spectral response from the UV to the visible region owing to surface plasmon resonance and it is favorable for enhancing the separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs. The results show that both LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF catalysts had good catalytic performance and high selectivity for the reduction of CO2 with H2O vapor to CH4 under thermal and photothermal reaction conditions. The catalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 with H2O vapor to CH4 under photothermal conditions is 5 times better than that under thermal-only conditions. Under the same reaction conditions, the double perovskite 3DOM-LSCF catalyst exhibits higher catalytic activity than the LSCF catalyst. The double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF retain high catalytic activity after reusing five times, which shows their considerable stability in the catalytic process. The reaction mechanism of the photothermal reduction of CO2 with H2O to CH4 over double perovskites LSCF and 3DOM-LSCF was proposed in more detail. From the results, we believe that the excellent catalytic performance of 3DOM-LSCF might be associated with its 3DOM structure with a highly porous structure, high surface areas, small crystallite size, mixed ions, mixed valence, self-formed heterostructures, and self-formed oxygen vacancies which can improve the CO2 and H2O absorption and reaction on the catalyst surface. These materials are considered as promising catalytic materials for the photothermal conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbon fuels, environmental cleaning, energy storage, catalysis and cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells.
