    , Accepted 25th June 2015First published on 30th June 2015AbstractHybrid nanostructures of low-dimensional metal oxide (MO) semiconductors based on two-dimensional (2D) graphene nanosheets have been considered as one of the most promising nanomaterials for an extensive variety of applications. Unfortunately, it is still challenging to rationally design and fabricate MO/graphene hybrids with highly controllable nanostructures and desirable properties, which are of paramount importance for practical applications. Here, we report a novel, facile and “green” glycerol-mediated self-assembly method, using α-Fe2O3 semiconductor as an illustrative example, for the controlled growth of MO with a well-defined nanostructure on 2D graphene nanosheets. Based on this new method, we first demonstrate the ability to exquisitely tune the α-Fe2O3 nanostructure from zero-dimensional quantum dots (∼3.2 nm) to one-dimensional mesoporous nanorods, and eventually to 2D mesoporous nanosheets over the entire surface of graphene nanosheets. A possible formation mechanism has been proposed based on the systematic investigation of the morphological evolution and growth processes of α-Fe2O3 on graphene. The as-synthesized samples exhibit excellent performance for the photo-Fenton treatment of polluted water at neutral pH under visible light irradiation. Moreover, TiO2 and Fe3O4 quantum dots (∼5.2 and 3.3 nm, respectively) ultradispersed on graphene are also successfully synthesized by this method, demonstrating its versatility for the rational fabrication of novel MO/graphene hybrids with huge potential applications.
Introduction
The ever-growing concerns about the environment and increasing social demands for alternative energy resources in the 21st century have been witnessed worldwide. They have intensely boosted tremendous interest in the search for novel and high-performance nanomaterials for environmental protection and energy storage/conversion.1,2 Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have attracted much research attention in a broad range of promising fields, from energy storage and conversion, and photocatalysis, to bio-sensing and antibacterial materials, due to their advantageous characteristics such as improved electrochemical activity and stable mechanical property, environmental benignity, as well as relatively low cost.3,4 Among these materials, graphene has a number of unique properties, such as intrinsically high electrical conductivity, good physical and chemical stabilities, large specific surface area, and high compatibility with many other materials.5 In the past decade, hybrid nanostructured materials have been considered as one of the most promising candidates for fulfilling a large number of energy and environmental needs, owing to their advantageous characteristics that not only combine the individual properties of the components but also produce strong synergistic effect by integration of the individual components.6,7 Taking advantage of such distinctive merits, 2D hybrid nanostructures constructed with metal oxides (MOs) nanounits as the main active agents and graphene nanosheets as the functional substrates have been receiving particularly intensive research efforts in many state-of-art applications, such as in photocatalysts, lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and solar cells.8 Conventional solution-based synthetic approaches, including direct hydrothermal synthesis and indirect synthesis by mixing the MOs with graphene oxide (GO) followed by subsequent chemical reaction processing, have been widely reported.9–13 However, such methods could be disadvantaged by several unexpected difficulties, ranging from high complexity of the synthesis methods to nonuniform dimensional development of the nano-MOs and their uneven distribution on the graphene surfaces.
To overcome such challenges, recently, several appealing approaches have been demonstrated to realize a rational combination of MOs on graphene nanosheets for renewable energy and environmental applications. For example, Zhang et al. executed the strategy of using a glucose-mediated hydrolysis approach to anchor TiO2 nanoparticles (∼15–20 nm in size) on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets for photocatalysis.14 The improved photocatalytic performance highlighted the effectiveness of homogeneously anchoring nanoparticles on graphene sheets for photocatalysis. Dai et al. used a two-step approach to grow Co3O4 nanocrystals (∼12–25 nm in size) in situ on reduced mildly oxidized graphene oxide to obtain a high-performance, low-cost bi-functional electrode catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction.15 This approach successfully addressed the issue of controlling the well-distributed nucleation of nano-Co3O4 on rGO nanosheets, which exhibited promising catalytic activity. In addition to the above-mentioned examples, other works related to the nano-MOs loaded on rGO have also been reported.16–23
Despite the exciting progresses to date, such methods unfortunately still possess inevitable drawbacks of being incapable of controlling the target nano-MOs’ size and the homogeneity of nano-MOs grown on rGO, especially when a high mass loading of MOs active content is desired for more advanced applications. In addition, most reported synthesis works are only described to obtain one specific shape of nano-MOs for a certain utility, but precisely tuning the in situ morphologies and dimensionalities of the target loading nanostructures on graphene — which is of great importance for rational design and fabrication of hybrid nanomaterials with desired properties — still remains a forbidding challenge to accommodate various material synthesis demands from the view of diverse practical applications.
Recently, Yi and co-workers have reported that various ZnO nanostructures (one-dimensional (1D) nanotubes and 2D nanowalls) can be fabricated on graphene using conventional e-beam lithography followed by selective growth of ZnO via chemical vapor deposition.24 However, this approach is tedious and uneconomical, and cannot to be extended to larger scale production. Qiao et al. have synthesized three kinds of Mn3O4 nanoparticles with different shapes (spheres, cubes, and ellipsoids) grown on graphene through a two-step liquid-phase procedure.25 Nevertheless, the degree of homogeneity of the Mn3O4 nanoparticles with different shapes is relatively low and the distribution of the Mn3O4 nanoparticles on graphene is not uniform. Therefore, it is extremely desirable to develop a novel, facile, economical synthetic approach to precisely control the morphology or dimensionality of the MOs nanostructures over the entire surface of graphene.
Herein, we report a novel, facile and “green” glycerol-mediated self-assembly (GMSA) method, using α-Fe2O3 as an illustrative example, for the controllable in situ growth of nano-MOs with well-defined nanostructures on graphene sheets. Based on this GMSA method, we first demonstrate the ability to exquisitely tune the α-Fe2O3 nanostructures from zero-dimensional (0D) quantum dots (QDs) to 1D mesoporous nanorods (NRs), and eventually to 2D mesoporous nanosheets (NSs) on graphene. The density of α-Fe2O3 dispersed on graphene can also be precisely controlled by easily tuning the dosage of Fe3+ content, surprisingly without changing the appealing α-Fe2O3 nanostructures obtained in the hybrid nanocomposites. Then, a possible formation mechanism has been proposed based on the systematic investigation of the morphological evolution and growth processes of α-Fe2O3 on graphene. Furthermore, to demonstrate their potential application for water treatment, the as-synthesized samples are used as heterogeneous catalysts for the photo-Fenton degradation of organic pollutant at neutral pH under visible light irradiation. Besides, TiO2 and Fe3O4 QDs uniformly grown in situ on graphene are also successfully synthesized by a similar method, which demonstrates the promising versatility of our GMAS method.
Results and discussion
GO was synthesized by the Hummers method,26 and its properties were characterized by AFM, TEM, XRD and Raman spectrometry as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Fig. S1a and b† demonstrate that the ultrathin smooth GO nanosheets (≤3 layers) with a broad size distribution are individually separated. The Raman characteristic peaks at 1348 and 1596 cm−1 are attributed to the D and G bands of GO, respectively (Fig. S1c†). The typical 002 reflection at 2θ = 11.5° of the GO can be easily observed in Fig. S1d.† Ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O), an inexpensive and nontoxic reagent, was selected as the iron source. Urea was adopted for synthesis of the samples because it can provide a steady alkaline source to promote the hydrolysis of Fe3+. It is noted that glycerol is used as a mediator for the self-assembly of tiny primary particles for the first time, due to its high affinity with oxides or hydroxides of iron, environmental-friendliness and easy removal from the nanomaterials.27–29 By controlling the dosage of glycerol, the morphology of α-Fe2O3 grown in situ on graphene sheets can be precisely tuned from 0D QDs to 1D NRs, and eventually to 2D NSs. A typical product, ultradispersed α-Fe2O3 QDs on graphene (named as QDs-Fe/G), was synthesized with the addition of 30 mL of glycerol. A low magnification TEM image of QDs-Fe/G (Fig. 1a) shows that the product is composed of many free-standing and ultrathin sheets with a morphology similar to the original GO sheets, and no naked graphene sheets or free α-Fe2O3 QDs can be observed. A moderate magnification TEM image (Fig. 1d) clearly shows that QDs-Fe/G retain well the 2D nanostructure of the original GO sheets, and a large number of α-Fe2O3 QDs with uniform diameter are ultradispersed on graphene sheets, which can maximize the 2D structural advantage of graphene sheet in the hybrid α-Fe2O3/graphene nanostructures. Meanwhile, no obvious large or aggregated α-Fe2O3 QDs can be observed. A size analysis of the QDs is presented in the histogram (Fig. 1d, inset), illustrating a narrow size distribution with an average diameter of 3.2 nm. It should be noted that the size of the QDs is comparable to the diffusion length of photo-generated holes (ca. 2–4 nm) in Fe2O3,30 which can enhance the photochemical activity of the QDs-Fe/G. With different contrasts, the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1g) of QDs-Fe/G demonstrates that highly crystalline α-Fe2O3 QDs are randomly distributed on two sides of the graphene sheets. The lattice spacing of 0.257 nm is assigned to the (110) crystallographic plane of α-Fe2O3.

Interestingly, 2D α-Fe2O3 NSs overlaid on graphene sheets (named as NSs-Fe/G) are easily synthesized when 12 mL glycerol is added to the reaction system while keeping other conditions unchanged. A low magnification TEM image (Fig. 1c) of NSs-Fe/G shows that the α-Fe2O3 NSs are uniformly covering the graphene sheets, forming a unique sheet-on-sheet nanostructure. With a closer examination (Fig. 1f), it is found that the α-Fe2O3 NSs have a size of ca. 45–75 nm. Unexpectedly, the high magnification TEM image of the NSs-Fe/G (Fig. 1f, inset) shows that large numbers of mesopores appear in the α-Fe2O3 NSs, which is distinctly different to previous reports.31–33 An HRTEM image of NSs-Fe/G (Fig. 1i) further verifies the presence of mesopores (marked with white dash dot line) with the size of ca. 2–4 nm. A well-defined crystalline lattice can be identified with a d spacing of 0.27 nm corresponding to the (104) plane of α-Fe2O3. When 5 mL glycerol is added to the reaction system, the morphology of α-Fe2O3 on graphene sheets evolves from 2D NSs to 1D NRs. This product is named NRs-Fe/G. As shown in Fig. 1b and e, the graphene sheets are densely and homogeneously covered by monodispersed NRs over their whole profile. The length of the NRs is ca. 30–70 nm and the average aspect-ratio is 4.5. The high magnification TEM image (Fig. 1e, inset) and HRTEM (Fig. 1h) of NRs-Fe/G show that the α-Fe2O3 NRs have a mesoporous structure (marked with white dash dot line) with pore size in the range of 4–10 nm. A d spacing of 0.27 nm corresponding to the (104) plane of α-Fe2O3 can be also identified in Fig. 1h. It is noted that the mesoporous architecture of the α-Fe2O3 nanounits in the NSs-Fe/G and NRs-Fe/G can not only accommodate the volume swing, but also facilitate transport/collection of charge carries and utilization of incident light.
The phase structure and purity of the as-prepared samples are examined by XRD. As shown in Fig. 2a, all the diffraction peaks in the patterns are readily indexed to a pure phase of α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS Card no. 33-0664). The broadening of the diffraction peaks of QDs-Fe/G further confirms its ultrafine feature. Moreover, a diffraction peak (ca. 26°) corresponding to the restacking of graphene sheets cannot be observed, illustrating that the agglomeration of graphene sheets can be effectively prevented by the α-Fe2O3 grown in situ on graphene. In Fig. 2b the Raman peak at 223 cm−1 is attributed to the A1g mode of α-Fe2O3, and the peaks at 287 and 401 cm−1 are assigned to the Eg mode of α-Fe2O3.34 The characteristic peaks of the D and G bands of graphene can also be easily observed on the Raman spectra. The intensity ratio of D band to G band (ID/IG) is usually used to evaluate the disorder. Compared with original GO (0.834), increased values of ID/IG are observed for QDs-Fe/G (1.010), NRs-Fe/G (1.010) and NSs-Fe/G (1.009). This could be ascribed to the introduction of α-Fe2O3 which increases the defects and disorder in the GO sheets.35 The as-synthesized samples were further characterized by nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms (Fig. S2a–c, ESI†). The BET surface areas of QDs-Fe/G, NRs-Fe/G, and NSs-Fe/G are 263, 249, and 317 m2 g−1, respectively, which are very high and superior to those of the previously reported hybrid Fe2O3/graphene materials.31,33,36,37 This is due to the unique nanostructures and uniform dispersity of the α-Fe2O3 nanounits in the hybrids. The TGA results show that the mass ratios of α-Fe2O3:graphene in the as-synthesized hybrids are close to 3:1 (Fig. S3, ESI†). The XPS full survey spectra (Fig. 2c) reveal that the as-prepared samples contain C, O, and Fe elements with characteristic peaks appearing at binding energies of 284.6 (C 1s), 530.0 (O 1s), and 710.6 eV (Fe 2p), respectively. These results are in good agreement with the information derived from HAADF images and corresponding EDS mapping images (Fig. 3). The Fe 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 2d) indicate that the levels of Fe 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 are, 710.6 and 724.2 eV, respectively, with the satellite peak at ca. 719 eV, which is characteristic of Fe2O3.38,39 The C 1s fine spectra of the as-synthesized samples and original GO are shown in Fig. 4a, which sufficiently illustrate the reduction of GO during the hydrothermal treatment. In the hydrothermal process, the overheated supercritical water can play the role of reducing agent for partly removing the oxygen-containing functional groups (i.e. epoxide, hydroxyl, and carboxyl functional groups) on GO, thus leading to the reduction of GO.40,41 The hydrothermal reduction process is believed to be analogous to the H+-catalyzed dehydration of alcohol, where the water acts as a source of H+ for the protonation of OH.41

In addition, the reduction of GO can also be verified by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 4b), where a dramatic decrease or disappearance of the absorption bands associated with oxygen-containing functional groups (C–O and CO) can be identified easily. Fig. 4c shows that a peak at ca. 531 eV attributed to the C–O–Fe bond is detected in all the as-synthesized samples, which indicates the intimate interactions between graphene and α-Fe2O3 nanounits. Meanwhile, the slight red shift of the characteristic peak for the C–C bond also confirms the intimate integration of graphene with α-Fe2O3 (Fig. 4b). Besides, severe agglomerations of the α-Fe2O3 nanostructures with different morphologies are witnessed under the same synthesis conditions in the absence of GO, which indirectly demonstrates the strong chemical interactions between graphene and α-Fe2O3 (Fig. S4a–c, ESI†).
To investigate the effects of experimental conditions on the morphology of α-Fe2O3 on graphene sheets, a series of experiments were carefully carried out. It was found that the morphology of α-Fe2O3 can be effectively tuned by controlling the dosage of glycerol. Fig. 5a–f show the TEM images of six samples obtained with different volumes of glycerol. As shown in Fig. 5a, rod- and tetrahedron-like nanostructures of α-Fe2O3 randomly dispersed on graphene are synthesized with 0 mL glycerol. When the volume of glycerol is increased to 5 mL, the tetrahedron-like nanostructures of α-Fe2O3 disappear gradually and uniform α-Fe2O3 NRs are formed, which are dispersed homogeneously and densely on graphene sheets (Fig. 5b). Upon increasing the volume of glycerol from 5 to 7 mL, 1D NRs and 2D NSs of α-Fe2O3 concurrently appear on the graphene sheets (Fig. 5c). As the volume of glycerol is further increased to 12 mL, the α-Fe2O3 NRs vanish completely and numerous α-Fe2O3 NSs are uniformly packed on graphene, forming an extraordinary sheet-on-sheet nanostructure (Fig. 5d). However, the 2D α-Fe2O3 NSs fade away when the amount of glycerol is increased to 17 mL and the surface of graphene sheets are partly covered by the 0D α-Fe2O3 QDs (Fig. 5e). Expectedly, when the volume of glycerol is increased to 30 mL, the 2D α-Fe2O3 NSs are completely disappeared and the entire surface of the graphene sheets is occupied by the ultradispersed α-Fe2O3 QDs (Fig. 5f). Still, as the volume of glycerol is further increased from 30 to 40 mL, the morphology of obtained product will be well retained, similar to that of the QDs-Fe/G. It is worth noting that the density of α-Fe2O3 grown in situ on graphene can also be precisely controlled by simply tuning the dosage of Fe3+, surprisingly without changing the appealing α-Fe2O3 nanostructures (e.g., QDs, mesoporous NRs) of the hybrid materials (Fig. S5a–f, ESI†). In addition, time-dependent experiments were also carried out to further investigate the growth processes of the samples. As to the growth of QDs-Fe/G, the ultradispersed nature of α-Fe2O3 grown on graphene is clearly observed for all samples collected at different reaction times (Fig. 6a–c), indicating that the generation of primary nanoparticles in quite fast and the aggregation of primary nanoparticles is well avoided. However, the growth processes of NRs-Fe/G and NSs-Fe/G are entirely different from that of QDs-Fe/G. For NRs-Fe/G, at the early stage, the nanostructures of α-Fe2O3 on graphene sheets are composed of 1D NRs and 0D nanoparticles (Fig. 6d). As the reaction proceeds, the amount of 1D NRs increases at the expense of 0D nanoparticles (Fig. 6e). Eventually, the surface of the graphene sheets is homogenously covered by 1D NRs (Fig. 6f). As can be seen in Fig. 6g–i, the growth process of NSs-Fe/G is similar to that of NRs-Fe/G, which involves a formation of primary nanoparticles followed by a slow assembly of primary nanoparticles to form 2D NSs.

Based on above experimental observations, the formation mechanism of α-Fe2O3 on graphene sheets is proposed and illustrated in Fig. 7. Firstly, brown GO suspensions with a certain amount of urea and FeCl3·6H2O were prepared, and Fe3+ ions are favorably adsorbed on the surface of GO sheets via electrostatic interactions. Then, different volumes of glycerol were added into the suspensions, which were stirred for 30 min to form orange homogeneous suspensions. Subsequently, during the hydrothermal process, large quantities of primary nanoparticles are generated, accompanied by the decomposition of urea and the reduction of GO. Simultaneously, the glycerol molecules with abundant hydroxyl groups are favorably adsorbed on the surface of the generated primary nanoparticles, forming large steric barriers and slowing down the growth rate of primary nanoparticles.39,42 However, primary nanoparticles are unstable and exhibit the tendency of self-aggregation, owing to their high surface energy. Thus, by further prolonging the hydrothermal treatment, α-Fe2O3 with different nanostructures are formed in situ on graphene sheets via the self-assembly of primary nanoparticles. It is noted that the glycerol molecules play a crucial role in the process of self-assembly of the primary nanoparticles. When the dosage of glycerol is high (≥30 mL), the surface of these primary nanoparticles are fully covered by the glycerol molecules, forming steric barriers strong enough to hinder the aggregation of primary nanoparticles and slowing down the growth of primary nanoparticles, thus leading to the 0D ultradispersed QDs on graphene sheets. When the volume of glycerol is decreased, the amount of glycerol molecules covering the surface of the primary particles will be decreased correspondingly. Therefore, the steric hindrance can no longer totally impede the aggregation of primary nanoparticles, leading to the formation of 1D NRs and 2D NSs via the 1D and 2D self-assembly of primary particles, respectively. On the other hand, the glycerol molecules embedded in the 1D and 2D nanostructures can be easily removed via solvent extraction during washing while the entire nanostructure of α-Fe2O3 is kept intact, resulting in the formation of mesoporous structures. Moreover, ultrafine MO nanoparticles such as TiO2 and Fe3O4 uniformly grown in situ on graphene are also successfully synthesized under the guidance of the above mentioned GMSA concepts (Fig. S6a and c, ESI†). The size analysis of the TiO2 and Fe3O4 is presented in the histograms (Fig. S6a and c† (inset)), illustrating a narrow size distribution with the average diameters of 5.2 and 3.3 nm, respectively. Fig. S6b and d† reveal that the TiO2 and Fe3O4 on graphene are well crystallized with the anatase phase (JCPDS Card no. 21-1272) and Fe3O4 (JCPDS Card no. 19-0629), respectively. These preliminary experimental results forcefully demonstrate the versatility of the proposed GMAS method.

Recently, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have emerged as alternative strategies for water purification in the context of addressing global environmental pollution.43 Among the AOPs, Fenton and photo-Fenton technologies are widely studied, owing to their high degradation efficiency and general applicability.44,45 However, traditional Fenton and photo-Fenton technologies require highly acidic conditions (pH 2–3) to avoid the hydrolysis of ferrous and ferric ions.46,47 Meanwhile, the generation of a large amount of residual sludge containing iron ions also makes this process tedious and uneconomical.48 To address these disadvantages, we adopt the as-synthesized samples as heterogeneous catalysts for the photo-Fenton reaction, and investigate their efficiencies in the degradation of RhB dye at neutral pH under visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 8a, the blank experiment reveals that RhB is barely decomposed under visible light irradiation, and the control experiments show that only limited degradation is observed in the presence of H2O2 or H2O2/α-Fe2O3. Even in the presence of both H2O2 and α-Fe2O3/graphene (α-Fe2O3/G), the degradation of RhB still remains rather low (40%). However, when the QDs-Fe/G, NRs-Fe/G and NSs-Fe/G are added, the photo-Fenton efficiencies can reach up to 92%, 84%, and 75%, respectively. The photo-Fenton degradation rate of RhB is also evaluated by using the pseudo-first-order model. As shown in Fig. 8c, the apparent rate constants of QDs-Fe/G, NRs-Fe/G and NSs-Fe/G are calculated as 0.0165, 0.0125 and 0.0086 min−1, respectively, which are shown to be much higher than that of H2O2 alone (0.0015 min−1), H2O2/α-Fe2O3 (0.0026 min−1), and H2O2/α-Fe2O3/G (0.0033 min−1). In addition, the colorless and recalcitrant phenol is employed as a target contaminate to further confirm the photo-Fenton activity of the as-synthesized sample. Fig. 8b shows that only very limited degradation rates for phenol (<15%) are achieved by the H2O2, H2O2/α-Fe2O3, and H2O2/α-Fe2O3/G. However, when the QDs-Fe/G, NRs-Fe/G and NSs-Fe/G are added in the photo-Fenton system, the degradation efficiencies can reach up to 50%, 31%, and 27%, respectively. The apparent rate constants of different samples in degradation of phenol can be ranked as the following sequence: H2O2 (0.0003 min−1) < α-Fe2O3-H (0.0004 min−1) < α-Fe2O3/G-H (0.0011 min−1) < NSs-Fe/G-H (0.0020 min−1) < NRs-Fe/G-H (0.0025 min−1) < QDs-Fe/G-H (0.0048 min−1), further demonstrating that the as-synthesized samples possess excellent photo-Fenton activity at neutral pH under visible light irradiation. Meanwhile, the temporal absorption spectrum changes of QDs-Fe/G for the degradation of RhB and phenol clearly show decreasing intensity of absorption spectra as time progressed, as shown in the insets of Fig. 8c and d.
 Fig. 8  Photo-Fenton efficiencies of the samples in the degradation of RhB (a) and phenol (b) at neutral pH under visible light irradiation and the degradation rate constants of RhB (c) and phenol (d) for different samples. Insets of (c) and (d) display the temporal absorption spectrum change of QDs-Fe/G for the photo-Fenton degradation of RhB and phenol, respectively. 
Furthermore, the apparent quantum efficiencies based on the total optical power impinging on the samples for the degradation of RhB and phenol have also been calculated with: φx = ± (d[x]/dt)(d[hv]inc/dt)−1, where d[x]/dt is the rate of change of the concentration of the targeted contaminant and d[hv]inc/dt is the total optical power impinging on the reaction liquid.49 For RhB, Fig. 9a shows that the apparent quantum efficiencies of QDs-Fe/G, NRs-Fe/G, and NSs-Fe/G are 3.53%, 3.15%, and 2.64%, respectively, which are much higher than that of H2O2 (0.94%) alone and H2O2/commercial α-Fe2O3 (1.45%). Besides, the higher photonic efficiencies of the as-synthesized samples than those of H2O2 alone and H2O2/commercial α-Fe2O3 for photo-Fenton degradation of phenol can also be observed clearly (Fig. 9b), illustrating the excellent photocatalytic performances of the as-prepared samples.

The pH of the solution is generally considered as an important factor for the photo-Fenton activity of the catalyst. Therefore, the effect of pH on the photo-Fenton efficiencies of QDs-Fe/G in the degradation of RhB has been further studied. As shown in Fig. S7,† although the photo-Fenton activity of the QDs-Fe/G is decreased by increasing pH, RhB removal as high as 64% is still achieved at a pH of 9.0, demonstrating that the disadvantage of requiring highly acidic conditions as for traditional Fenton and photo-Fenton technologies can be overcome by employing the QDs-Fe/G catalyst. In addition, the iron leaching from the QDs-Fe/G has also been investigated under different pH (Table S1†). It can be seen that a high concentration of iron ions (19.80 mg L−1) is detected in the solution at an acidic pH of 3.0. When the pH is increased to 5.0, only 0.341 mg L−1 of iron ions is detected. With the further increase of pH to 7.0 and then 9.0, negligible iron leaching from the QDs-Fe/G can be observed.
The physicochemical stability of the as-synthesized sample, using the QDs-Fe/G as an illustrative example, has been investigated by FTIR spectrometry and ICP-OES spectrometry. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), no obvious changes can be observed in the FTIR spectra of the original QDs-Fe/G and the used QDs-Fe/G. In addition no iron leaching from the QDs-Fe/G can be detected by the ICP-OES spectrometer during the whole reaction process. These results highlight the high physicochemical stability of the QDs-Fe/G as photo-Fenton catalysts. The high photo-Fenton activity and high stability of the as-synthesized samples may be attributed to the synergistic coupling effects in these samples: (1) the unique morphologies of 0D QDs (ca. 3.2 nm), 1D mesoporous NRs, and 2D mesoporous NSs are beneficial for shortening the radial distance for the diffusion of photo-excited carriers to the α-Fe2O3/graphene interface.31,37 (2) 2D graphene sheets could be regarded as ideal conductive substrates, which may improve the electron transport.36,50–52 (3) The well-dispersed nature of α-Fe2O3 nanostructures have taken full advantage of the 2D nanoarchitecture of graphene, which may further enhance the synergistic effects of α-Fe2O3 and graphene.53 (4) The intimate integration of graphene with α-Fe2O3 can not only promote effective and rapid charge transfer between the graphene and α-Fe2O3, but also enhance the stability of the hybrid nanostructures. (5) The high surface areas of QDs-Fe/G, NRs-Fe/G and NSs-Fe/G not only promote the adsorption of the organic pollutants, but also provide more active sites for the photo-Fenton reaction.33 (6) Compared with commercial α-Fe2O3, the as-prepared samples exhibit a remarkable optical absorption in the visible light region (Fig. S9, ESI†), which may be beneficial for the increase of the number of photo-excited carriers.36
To elucidate the mechanism involved in the photo-Fenton degradation of organic contaminant, trapping experiments for both ˙OH and O2˙− have been conducted in this work to determine the specific reactive species that played a major role,35,54–56 as shown in Fig. S10.† It is found that the addition of tert-butanol as the scavenger of ˙OH radicals causes an obvious decrease of the degradation efficiency of RhB, while the degradation of RhB is not significantly affected by the presence of ascorbic acid as the scavenger of O2˙− radicals, demonstrating that the ˙OH radicals may be the main active oxidative species in the photo-Fenton degradation of RhB. The concentration change of ˙OH radicals with reaction time has also been investigated by using terephthalic acid (TA) as probing agent, because the ˙OH radicals can react with TA in basic solution to generate a fluorescent substance (i.e., 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (TAOH)) with its peak centered at ca. 426 nm.57 As shown in Fig. 10, stronger and stronger fluorescent signals associated with TAOH are observed for the QDs-Fe/G upon visible light irradiation at increased irradiation times, further illustrating the role played by ˙OH radicals in the degradation of RhB. Based on this result, a possible mechanism for the photo-Fenton degradation of organic pollutants can be proposed below: Fe3+ on surface of the catalyst + hv → Fe2+ on surface of the catalyst(1) Fe2+ on surface of the catalyst + H2O2 → Fe3+ on surface of the catalyst + ˙OH + OH−(2) Contaminant adsorbed on the catalyst + ˙OH → degradation intermediates + CO2 + H2O(3)
 Fig. 10  The time-dependent fluorescence spectra of TAOH formed by the reaction of TA with ˙OH radicals generated by the QDs-Fe/G under visible light irradiation. 
Firstly, the photo-Fenton reactions are triggered by the photoreduction of Fe3+ on the surface of the heterogeneous catalyst under visible light irradiation. Then the Fe2+ formed in first step accelerates the decomposition of H2O2 and the generation of ˙OH radicals, as well as the regeneration of Fe3+. Finally, the ˙OH radicals can attack the organic contaminant adsorbed on the catalyst, thus leading to the degradation of the organic contaminant.58 It is noted that the Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle on the surface of heterogeneous catalyst not only benefits the stability of the catalyst, but also reduces the amount of sludge produced in the photo-Fenton system.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a novel, facile and “green” GMSA method for controllable in situ growth of α-Fe2O3 nanostructures on graphene sheets. The morphological evolution and growth process of the hybrid α-Fe2O3/graphene nanostructures have been investigated and a possible mechanism is proposed. It is found that the morphology of α-Fe2O3 grown in situ on graphene can be exquisitely tuned by controlling the dosage of glycerol in the reaction system. The density of α-Fe2O3 on graphene can also be controlled by simply tuning the dosage of Fe3+. The as-synthesized samples have exhibited excellent performance when used as photo-Fenton catalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants in water. Moreover, ultrafine TiO2 and Fe3O4 QDs uniformly grown on graphene were also successfully synthesized by this method, which as a novel platform can be potentially applied to the rational design and synthesis of many other novel hybrid MOs/graphene nanostructures with promising potential applications in water treatment, LIBs, supercapacitors, and water splitting, etc.
Experimental section
Synthesis
All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Deionized water was used throughout. GO was synthesized by the Hummers method.26 Various α-Fe2O3 nanostructures on graphene were prepared by the GMSA method. In a typical procedure, 5 mL of 0.2 M FeCl3 aqueous solution and 0.3 g urea were added into 30 mL of GO aqueous solution and sonicated for 0.5 h. Then different volumes of glycerol were added to the mixture and stirred for 0.5 h at room temperature. After that, the above suspensions were transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave, which was sealed and maintained at 150 °C for 24 h. The obtained precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed several times with absolute ethanol and deionized water. Finally, the synthesized samples were dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. The detailed synthesis processes of TiO2 and Fe3O4 QDs grown on graphene were shown in the ESI.†
Characterization
The morphologies of the samples were observed with a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope (TEM), JEOL JEM-1400 TEM and Bruker BioScope atomic force microscope (AFM). X-ray diffraction patterns were collected by a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). Raman spectra were taken on a Renishaw inVia Micro-Raman spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using a Thermo ESCALAB 250 with Al Kα X-ray (hν = 1486.6 eV) radiation. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurements were carried out by an ASAP2020 instrument. The Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum One B spectrometer. The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were achieved by a Shimadzu UV2550 spectrophotometer. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed by a TGA/SDTA851e thermogravimetric analyzer under standard atmosphere from 25 to 800 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1.
Photo-Fenton degradation of organic pollutants
The photo-Fenton activities of the as-synthesized samples were evaluated by measuring the decomposition of rhodamine B (RhB) and phenol, which were regarded as typical organic pollutants in water. A 300 W short-arc xenon lamp (Perkin-Elmer, PE300BF) equipped with a 400 nm cut-off filter was used as light source. The wavelength distribution of short-arc xenon lamp is displayed in the ESI (Fig. S11†). The illumination intensity at the center of the reactor was 120 mW cm−2 (measured by an optical power meter (Coherent, FieldMaxII-TO)). The reactor was made of open cylindrical Pyrex with diameter 4 cm and height 7 cm. The distance between light source and the surface of the solute was approximately 20 cm. For photo-Fenton degradation of RhB, 10 mg of sample was suspended in 50 mL of RhB solution (C0 = 50 mg L−1), and the mixture was stirred for 30 min to reach an adsorption equilibrium in the dark. The pH of solution was adjusted to 7.0 ± 0.2 with dilute aqueous solution of NaOH and HCl. 0.5 mL of the H2O2 aqueous solution (3%) was added to the reaction solution at the beginning of the irradiation. The temperature of the reactor was maintained at 25 °C by continuous circulating water. For the photo-Fenton degradation of phenol (C0 = 20 mg L−1), a similar experimental method was employed, except that 15 mg sample and 1.0 mL H2O2 aqueous solution were added. About 1.5 mL of the suspension was collected at regular intervals and analysed for residual contaminant concentration. The concentration of RhB and phenol were determined by the absorption peaks at 554 and 270 nm, respectively, using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Hach, DR5000). Moreover, the photo-Fenton activities of the samples were also evaluated by comparing the apparent reaction rate constants (k). The k could be calculated using: k = −(1/t)ln(C/C0), where k is the apparent reaction rate constant; C0 and C are the initial concentration and the reaction concentration of the targeted contaminant, respectively. The iron leaching from the sample in the photo-Fenton reaction system was detected by an ICP-OES spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Optima 5300DV). ˙OH radical reactions were performed as follows. 15 mg of the sample was suspended in 50 mL aqueous solution containing 2 mM NaOH and 0.5 mM terephthalic acid. Then, the suspension was stirred in the dark for 30 min before the lamp was turned on. A fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, F7000) was used to measure the fluorescence signals. The excitation light wavelength used in recording fluorescence spectra was 315 nm.
