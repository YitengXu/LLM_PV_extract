    , Accepted 6th June 2016First published on 6th June 2016AbstractWith the aim of producing materials with enhanced optical and photocatalytic properties, titanate nanotubes (TNTs) modified by cobalt doping (Co-TNT) and by Na+ → Co ion-exchange (TNT/Co) were successfully prepared by a hydrothermal method. The influence of the doping level and of the cobalt position in the TNT crystalline structure was studied. Although no perceptible influence of the cobalt ion position on the morphology of the prepared titanate nanotubes was observed, the optical behaviour of the cobalt modified samples is clearly dependent on the cobalt ions either substituting the Ti4+ ions in the TiO6 octahedra building blocks of the TNT structure (doped samples) or replacing the Na+ ions between the TiO6 interlayers (ion-exchange samples). The catalytic ability of these materials on pollutant photodegradation was investigated. First, the evaluation of hydroxyl radical formation using the terephthalic acid as a probe was performed. Afterwards, phenol, naphthol yellow S and brilliant green were used as model pollutants. Anticipating real world situations, photocatalytic experiments were performed using solutions combining these pollutants. The results show that the Co modified TNT materials (Co-TNT and TNT/Co) are good catalysts, the photocatalytic performance being dependent on the Co/Ti ratio and on the structural metal location. The Co(1%)-TNT doped sample was the best photocatalyst for all the degradation processes studied.
1. Introduction
Over the past years, the nanostructured materials have become one of the most important research topics and have established a remarkable development in several scientific areas. In particular, the use of nanocrystalline semiconductors on photocatalytic treatment of wastewaters has been generating great interest in the scientific community.
Though a wide variety of materials have been tested for photocatalysis, including SnO2,1,2 ZnO,3,4 CeO25,6 and CuO,7 TiO2 has been the most extensively used semiconductor in the removal of a large number of organic pollutants from water systems.8–11 However, TiO2 has a major drawback in processes associated with solar photocatalysis due to its wide bandgap (3.2 eV), making it difficult to implement an overall technological process based on TiO2. The high recombination rate of photo-charge carriers is also a handicap for this semiconductor large scale application. Therefore, the synthesis of TiO2-based materials with a broader range of light absorption and a lower charge recombination rate would be an important achievement towards the development of successful photoactive materials.12
Stimulated by the discovery of carbon nanotubes, one-dimensional nanostructured materials have become an intense research topic in nanotechnology owing to their unusual properties and a wide variety of potential applications. Among them, titanate nanotubes (TNTs) are remarkable materials since they combine the conventional properties of TiO2 nanoparticles with the properties of layered titanates, such as photocatalytic activity and ion-exchange ability.12–15 Additionally they have an open mesoporous morphology with a higher specific surface area than TiO2, which is a very important parameter for surface-based applications such as photocatalysis. Despite their high charge recombination rate and wide bandgap (ca. 3.3 eV), the TNTs' ion-exchange ability makes them potential materials for effective photocatalysts and solar energy cell applications.12,15–19 However, to be used under visible solar light irradiation, new TNT sensitization processes are needed and will be welcomed. Therefore, the synthesis of TNT-based materials with either a broader range of light absorption and/or a lower charge recombination rate would be an important achievement towards the development of successful photoactive materials. However, one issue is how to produce more photo-induced electrons and holes; another one is how to improve the separation efficiency of these electrons and holes.
It is well known that doping with transition metal ions can introduce new energetic levels in the forbidden zone that will act as electron traps, resulting in the production of some defects and thus in a decrease of the charge carrier recombination. Therefore, doping by metal ions is generally accepted as a swift method to improve TNTs' photo-activity under UV-vis radiation.20,21 Beyond doping, also sensitization with organic dyes or semiconductor nanoparticles has been used to improve TNTs' photocatalytic performance.22
Despite the fact that many of these photocatalysts are effective for the degradation of organic pollutants, the design of materials exhibiting a higher activity under visible light is still a challenge. Moreover, the stability and efficiency of these catalysts are still low and need to be improved. Searching for new TNT-based photocatalysts with high photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation, a novel chemical route to synthesize homogenous cobalt-doped titanate nanotubes (Co-TNT) with high adsorption ability for methylene blue was recently reported by our group. In particular, it was shown that the amount of adsorbed dye was much higher than the one predicted for monolayer formation, which suggests the possibility of intercalation of the dye molecule between the TiO6 layers of the TNT structure. Moreover, it was also shown that the methylene blue sensitized Co-TNT structures are highly stable under UV radiation and present a strong and broad absorption in the visible region.15
This work reports on the synthesis of nanocrystalline TNT-based materials modified by both cobalt doping (Co-TNT) and Co ion-exchange (TNT/Co) prepared via a hydrothermal treatment of an amorphous undoped and Co-doped precursors recently reported by our group.15,16 The influence of the Co content and/or the Co position in the TNT structure on the optical and photocatalytic properties of the materials was studied. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was firstly investigated using terephthalic acid (TA) as a probe molecule to study the catalytic production of the hydroxyl radical (OH˙). Their photocatalytic performance was subsequently studied using phenol, naphthol yellow S (NYS) and brilliant green (BG) as model pollutants. The best catalytic sample was then tested on a mixture of all the pollutants. The results show that either Co-TNT or TNT/Co modified samples are better catalysts than the pristine TNTs, the photocatalytic performance being dependent on the cobalt content and on the cobalt position in the TNT crystalline structure.
2. Materials and methods
In this work, all reagents used were of analytical grade or chemical grade (Aldrich and Fluka) and were used as received. Double-distilled water was used for solution preparation.
2.1. Synthesis of undoped and Co-doped TNT precursors
The TNT precursor was prepared using a procedure published elsewhere.12,23 A titanium trichloride solution (10 wt% in 20–30 wt% HCl) diluted in a ratio of 1:2 in standard HCl solution (37%) was used as the titanium source. To this solution a 4 M ammonia aqueous solution was added dropwise under vigorous stirring, until complete precipitation of a white solid. The resulting suspension was kept for 15 h at room temperature and then filtered and vigorously rinsed with deionized water in order to remove the remaining ammonia and chloride ions. This white solid was used afterwards to prepare the TNT sample.
An identical synthesis route was used to synthesize the Co-doped TNT precursor by adding the required molar amount (nominal percentage of 5% or 1%) of cobalt to the titanium trichloride solution using the following procedure: 0.1178 g (for Co 5%) and 0.0236 g (for Co 1%) of metallic cobalt powder was carefully dissolved in ca. 1 mL of concentrated HNO3. The deep purple solution was heated to evaporate the solvent and ca. 2 mL of HCl (37%) solution was added to evaporate the residual nitrates, with the formation of a yellow steam. After no yellowish steam was observed, the solution was diluted with 2 M HCl to the 100 mL final volume. This solution was added to 50 mL of TiCl3 solution. After precipitation with 4 M ammonia solution, the Co-doped TNT precursors were obtained as a bluish grey solid (1% of Co) and a greenish dark grey solid (5% of Co).
2.2. Synthesis of TNT, Co-TNT and TNT/Co samples
The undoped and Co-doped TNT samples were synthesized in an autoclave using 10 g of undoped and Co-doped precursors, respectively, in ca. 70 mL of NaOH 10 M aqueous solution. The samples were prepared at 160 °C for autoclaving for 24 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the suspensions were filtered and the powders were washed several times with deionized water until a filtrate with pH = 7 was attained. The obtained undoped and Co-doped samples were identified as TNT, Co(1%)-TNT and Co(5%)-TNT.
The Co ion-exchanged titanate nanotubes were synthesized using 10 g of TNT previously prepared in 60 mL of cobalt nitrate aqueous solution, by adding the required Co molar amount of 5%. The resulting suspension was kept for 7 h under stirring at room temperature. Afterwards, the suspensions were vigorously rinsed with deionized water in order to remove the remaining cobalt ions. The obtained Co ion-exchanged sample was identified as TNT/Co(5%). Afterwards, the solids were dried and stored.
2.3. Photocatalytic degradation assays
The photodegradation experiments were conducted using a 250 mL refrigerated photo-reactor.24 A 450 W Hanovia medium-pressure mercury-vapour lamp was used as a radiation source, the total irradiated energy being 40–48% in the ultraviolet range and 40–43% in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Phenol, naphthol yellow S (NYS) and brilliant green (BG) were used as contaminant models to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the TNT-based samples under UV-vis irradiation. The catalytic photodegradation assays were performed by adding 20 mg of powder to 150 mL of 20 ppm phenol, 20 ppm NYS, and 10 ppm BG aqueous solutions. In order to test the photodegradation of a combination of pollutants, an assay was also performed with a mixture of phenol, NYS, and BG, following an identical procedure. Prior to irradiation, suspensions were stirred in darkness for 60 minutes to ensure adsorption equilibrium. During irradiation, suspensions were sampled at regular intervals, centrifuged and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or UV-vis analysis, depending on the organic compound (see below). For convenience, the adsorption time is marked as 60 minutes in the graphics.

2.3.1. Hydroxyl radical (OH˙) evaluation through a terephthalic acid (TA) method. 
The evaluation of the hydroxyl radical production was carried out using terephthalic acid (TA) as a probe molecule. The hydroxyl radical (OH˙), formed during catalytic irradiation, converts the terephthalic acid into 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (HTA), a fluorescent product easily detected and quantified by fluorescence spectroscopy. The photocatalytic experiments were performed by applying the same conditions described in Section 2.3 but using a 3 mM TA solution prepared in 0.01 M NaOH aqueous solution. During irradiation, suspensions were sampled at regular intervals, centrifuged and analysed by fluorescence spectroscopy.

2.4. Characterization
The structural characterization of the samples was performed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a Philips Analytical X-ray diffractometer (PW 3050/60) with automatic data acquisition (X’ Pert Data Collector (v2.0b) software), employing Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) working at 40 kV/30 mA. The diffraction patterns were collected in the 2θ range of 5° to 60° with a 0.02° step size and an acquisition time of 2.0 s/step. The Kα2 contribution was removed before the XRD pattern analyses. The 2θ angular position of the diffraction peaks and their full-width at half-maximum, β, were calculated by fitting the experimental diffraction lines with a Pseudo-Voigt function. The β values were corrected taking into account the instrumental broadening. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired using a JEOL 200CX electron microscope operating at 300 kV. The elemental composition of the samples was evaluated by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) using a ThermoNoran model SystemSix spectroscope coupled to the TEM equipment. Specific surface areas were obtained by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (B.E.T.) method, from nitrogen (Air Liquide, 99.999%) adsorption data at −196 °C, using a volumetric apparatus from Quantachrome mod NOVA 2200e. The samples, weighing approximately 55 mg, were previously degassed for 2.5 h at 300 °C at a pressure lower than 0.133 Pa. Room temperature micro-Raman spectra were measured using a Jobin–Yvon T64000 spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled CCD detector using the 514.5 nm excitation line of an Ar+ laser, with an incident power of 0.4 mW or 4 mW on the sample surface in approximately 1 μm spot, a 20× objective lens with a spectral resolution of 1 cm−1 and backscattering geometry. Several spectra were recorded in different places of each sample using two incident powers of 0.4 mW and 4 mW, with no significant differences being detected. The powder diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained using an UV-vis spectrometer Shimadzu UV-2600PC equipped with an ISR 2600plus integrating sphere, in the wavelength range of 200−1400 nm. XPS analyses were performed using a Kratos AXIS Ultra HSA, using VISION software for data acquisition and CASAXPS software for data analysis. The spectra were collected with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.7 eV), operating at 15 kV (90 W), in the fixed analyser transmission mode (FAT mode), with a pass energy of 40 eV for regions ROI and 80 eV for survey. Data acquisition was performed at a pressure lower than 1 × 10−6 Pa, and it was used as a charge neutralization system. The effect of the electric charge was corrected with reference to the carbon peak (285 eV). The deconvolution of spectra was carried out using either XPSPEAK41 or CasaXPS software, in which the peak fitting is performed using a Gaussian–Lorentzian peak shape and Shirley (or Linear) type background subtraction.
Fluorescence spectra of 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid were measured on a SpexFlourolog 3-22/Tau 3, with excitation and emission wavelengths at 315 and 425 nm, respectively. The phenol solutions were monitored using a GC-MS, the conversion of products was monitored by taking samples and analysing them using a Shimadzu QP2100-Plus GC/MS system with a capillary column Tecknokroma TRB-5MS. An UV-vis spectrophotometer Shimadzu UV-2600PC was used for monitoring the absorption of the NYS and BG solutions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural and morphological characterization
All the prepared TNT-based powders were analysed by XRD, their diffractograms are displayed in Fig. 1. The XRD pattern of the undoped TNT powders shows 2θ peaks centered at 10.22°, 24.34°, 28.40°, and 48.43° corresponding to (100), (102), (111) and (303) crystal planes respectively, in agreement with a Na2Ti3O7 layered titanate structure,12,16,25–28 and in good match with Na2Ti3O7 JCPDS file no. 72-0148. In particular, the diffraction peak at 2θ = 10.22° is related to the distance between the TiO6 octahedra sheets that form the layered TNT structure and host the Na+ ions between them. Shifts of this peak are usually indicative of the Na+ replacement by other ionic species, e.g. H+ and Ce4+.12,28 This can be clearly seen in the diffractogram of the Co ion exchanged TNT/Co(5%) sample, for which the above-mentioned peak shifts from 2θ = 10.22° to 8.74°, as a result of the incorporation of cobalt via Na/Co ion exchange between the TiO6 sheets. It should be noted that the observed decrease of the 2θ position implies an increase of the interlayer distance, which is expected since the ionic radius of Na+ is smaller than that of hydrated Co2+.29

In what concerns the XRD pattern of the Co(1%)-TNT powder, it is similar to that obtained for the undoped TNT sample, with no shift of the peak related to the TiO6 interlayer distance. This indicates that no Na/Co replacement took place for this sample, the doping most probably occurring by substitution of Ti4+ by Co2+ in the TiO6 octahedra of the TNT crystal structure.15 Regarding the XRD pattern of the doped Co(5%)-TNT sample, it shows a clear shift of the aforementioned peak related to the TiO6 interlayers, although to a less extent of that observed for the ion-exchanged TNT/Co(5%) sample. This strongly suggests that some cobalt ions were incorporated between the TiO6 layers during the Co(5%)-TNT sample synthesis process, beyond the expected cobalt doping via the Ti4+ → Co2+ replacement in the TiO6 octahedra. It should also be noted that the XRD patterns of all Co-modified TNT samples show no signs of undesirable crystalline phases, e.g. cobalt clusters, cobalt oxides or Co–Ti oxide phases, which are known to exist in the bulk Co–Ti–O phase diagram.15,30
The effect of ionic Co presence on the structure of TNTs was studied by analysing the lattice parameters and the unit cell volume of the synthesized samples. Based on the interplanar distance between the (hkl) planes of the Na2Ti3O7 monoclinic system, the lattice parameters of the different synthesized samples were calculated. The lattice parameters obtained as well as the unit cell volumes are given in Table 1. The lattice parameters of the undoped TNT sample are in good match with that of Na2Ti3O7 JCPDS file no. 72-0148, with a unit cell volume (Vcell) deviation of only 3.3% in comparison to the standard value. Concerning the Co(1%)-TNT sample, it presents only a slight increase of the unit cell volume in relation to the value determined for the undoped TNT sample. However, the Vcell values increase significantly for the Co(5%)-TNT and TNT/Co(5%) samples, which supports the above-mentioned hypothesis that some cobalt ions were incorporated between the TiO6 layers during the Co(5%)-TNT sample synthesis process, beyond the intended cobalt doping via replacing the Ti4+/Co2+.

The morphology of the pristine and Co-modified TNT powders was evaluated by TEM. Fig. 2 shows a micrograph of each prepared sample. As can be seen, all samples present similar morphology, consisting of homogeneous nanotubes with a diameter of ∼7 nm and a high length/diameter aspect ratio. No influence of either the Co doping or the Co ion-exchange step was noticed on the morphology of the samples (Fig. S1, ESI†).15 For the 5% cobalt modified samples, i.e. Co(5%)-TNT and TNT/Co(5%) samples, the presence of Co in addition to Ti, O and Na elements was confirmed by EDS (not shown). This analysis was not possible for the Co(1%)-TNT sample due to equipment limitations.

The specific surface area of the samples was evaluated by the B.E.T. method (Fig. S2, ESI†). The pristine TNT sample shows a value of 288.60 m2 g−1. In comparison, the Co-doped samples present a slight decrease of the specific surface area: 241.59 m2 g−1 and 267.22 m2 g−1 values were obtained for the Co(5%)-TNT and Co-(1%)TNT samples, respectively. In contrast, the Co ion-exchange TNT/Co(5%) sample presents a specific surface area of 298.88 m2 g−1, higher than that obtained for the pristine powder, this result being also consistent with substitution of sodium by cobalt in the TNT lamellar structure, as previously shown by Morgado et al.31
Raman spectroscopy was used to further investigate the local structure of the as-prepared samples. Fig. 3 shows the Raman spectra of all the prepared TNT based samples. Raman spectra of TNT show bands near 120, 155, 192, 276, 377, 449, 670, 825, and 914 cm−1. To the best of our knowledge, theoretical calculations regarding the vibrational modes of the titanate nanotubes have not yet been reported. However, a comparison of the Raman spectra of the synthesized samples with those reported in the literature shows that the set of observed bands agree well with that of Na2Ti3O7.28,32,34
 Fig. 3  Raman spectra of the pristine TNT, Co(1%)-TNT, Co(5%)-TNT and TNT/Co(5%) samples. 
It should also be noted that a direct comparison of the TNTs' Raman spectra with that of TiO2 has strong limitations. It is known that titania exist in three common crystalline structures; rutile (tetragonal), anatase (tetragonal), and brookite (orthorhombic), and belong to space groups D4h (P42/mnm), D4h (I41/amd), and D2h (Pbca) respectively. However, at room temperature, bulk Na2Ti3O7 exhibits a lamellar monoclinic structure within the space group C2h2 (P21/m).34 Moreover, rutile TiO2 has four Raman active modes (A1g + B1g + B2g + Eg) located at 144, 448, 612, and 828 cm−1 and anatase TiO2 has six Raman active modes (A1g + 2B1g + 3Eg) at 144, 192, 395, 515/519 and 638 cm−1. Therefore, the Na2Ti3O7 Raman spectra and the respective structures are different from those of anatase and rutile phases, although some peaks appeared in the vicinity of the active modes owing to the TiO2 derived origin. Furthermore, 69 vibrational modes are predicted for Na2Ti3O7 bulk structures distributed among the irreducible representations as follows: 24Ag + 11Au + 12Bg + 22 Bu.34 Additionally, as the nanotubes have a scroll-like structure there is no radial symmetry, therefore it is not appropriate to apply standard factor group analysis.
According to previous studies, Raman peaks at 155 and 192 cm−1 correspond to the Na–O–Ti lattice modes, while those located at ca. 276, 449, 670 and 693 cm−1 can be ascribed to the Ti–O–Ti stretching in edge-shared TiO6.28,32,33 The band at 914 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of the shorter Ti–O bonds whose oxygen is not shared among the distorted TiO6 units. The analysis of the obtained spectra indicates a clear influence of the Co doping level and the ion position in the structure of the samples. The Raman spectrum of the Co(1%)-TNT sample is similar to that obtained for the undoped TNT sample, without any detectable peak shifts within the spectral resolution used. This seems to support the hypotheses that, at this low doping level, only the substitution of Ti4+ by Co2+ in the TiO6 octahedra occurs. However, the Raman spectra of both the doped Co(5%)-TNT and ion-exchanged TNT/Co(5%) samples display quite different features. The samples' spectra show that both the highest frequency mode (914 cm−1) and the lowest frequency modes (155 and 192 cm−1) have their wavenumbers and intensities affected either by the higher doping level or by the Co ionic position, in a similar manner to that reported by Marques et al. for Ce4+ doping/intercalation within the titanate nanotubes.28 Besides, the Co(5%)-TNT sample shows an increase in the intensity ratio between the modes at 825 cm−1 and 670 cm−1. The Raman modes at 825 cm−1 and 914 cm−1 are not observed for the ion-exchanged TNT/Co(5%) sample, instead a new mode appeared at about 860 cm−1. Furthermore, the spectrum of the Co(5%)-TNT sample presents a clear broadening and shifting of the wavenumber modes at 449 cm−1 and 670 cm−1 to 435 cm−1 and 693 cm−1, respectively. The fact that these modes correspond to the Ti–O–Ti stretching in edge-shared TiO6 strengthens the aforementioned hypothesis that some ionic cobalt was incorporated between TiO6 layers during the Co(5%)-TNT sample synthesis process, beyond the expected Co doping via the Ti4+/Co2+ substitution into the TiO6 octahedra. The ion-exchange TNT/Co(5%) sample shows a similar behaviour although less pronounced, the peak at 670 cm−1 shifting to 683 cm−1. Additionally, the disappearance of the 914 cm−1 mode and the appearance of a new mode at 860 cm−1 observed for the ion-exchanged TNT/Co(5%) sample may be seen as a signature of substitution of Na+ by ionic hydrated Co into TNT interlayers.19,34,35 The TNTs' interlayer modification can also be pursued in the low wavenumber range, where the lattice Raman mode at 192 cm−1 shifts to 190 cm−1 and the intensity of the mode at 155 cm−1 decreases (or vanishes) with the substitution of Na+ by ionic hydrated Co.28 Thus, the different degrees of structural rearrangement of the prepared samples induced either by Co doping or by Co ion-exchange can be clearly attributed to the Raman modes of the samples and are in accordance with the XRD data previously discussed.
3.2. UV-vis and XPS characterization
The optical characterization of the samples was carried out by measuring their diffuse reflectance, R, in the UV-vis region. R is related to the absorption Kubelka–Munk function, FKM, by the relation FKM (R) = (1 − R)2/2R, which is proportional to the absorption coefficient.36 The samples' absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the light absorption edge of the TNT powders is clearly red-shifted after Co modification. The Co-containing samples absorb radiation in the visible region, the Co(5%)-TNT sample being the one with higher light absorption capability.
 Fig. 4  Optical spectra of the pristine TNT, Co(1%)-TNT, Co(5%)-TNT and TNT/Co(5%) samples. 
The observed optical red shift of the Co-doped samples can be attributed to the insertion of the Co 3d orbitals within the forbidden band and the subsequent charge-transfer transition between the d-electrons of the dopant and the conduction band of the TNT, besides the defects associated with oxygen vacancies generated for charge balancing when Co2+ replaces the Ti4+ in the TiO6 octahedra TNT building blocks.15
The UV-vis spectra of Co-doped TNT samples also exhibit an absorption band at around 480–650 nm, a typical feature associated with transition metal doped semiconductors which may arise from the charge transfer and d–d transitions of the metal.37
According to Morgado et al. the introduction of Co2+ 3d states into the trititanate crystal structure results in their splitting, leading to the formation of lower and higher 3d energy states.31
This hypothesis should be experimentally supported by an increase of the d–d transitions with increasing Co content. The analysis of the results obtained for the doped Co(1%)-TNT and Co(5%)-TNT samples does not allow reaching this conclusion; indeed the Co(5%)-TNT absorption band centred at 580 nm is weaker than that of Co(1%)-TNT. This result strongly suggests a co-existence of cobalt in the crystalline lattice and in the interlayers in accordance with the XRD and Raman data. Moreover, this is also supported by some similarities between the optical behaviour of the Co(5%)-TNT and TNT/Co(5%) samples, especially for wavelengths below 480 nm. Concerning the optical red shift of the ion-exchanged TNT/Co(5%) sample, the intercalated Co ions in the interlayer region may form a one-dimensional Co chain, the overlapped Co-3d orbitals along the channel resulting in a delocalized 1D band below the Fermi level which extends the absorption edge into the visible region, similarly to what happens when Fe is intercalated in TNT based structures.38
The optical bandgap energies of the samples were calculated using the procedure previously described,1 by plotting the function fKM = (FKM·hν)1/2vs. hν (Tauc plot), where h stands for Planck's constant and ν for the radiation frequency, and by extrapolating the linear portion of the curve to zero absorption (Fig. S3, ESI†). The values of 3.27 ± 0.03 eV, 2.43 ± 0.05 eV and 2.27 ± 0.02 eV were obtained for TNT, Co(1%)-TNT and TNT/Co(5%) samples respectively. No accurate bandgap energy was possible to infer for the Co(5%)-TNT sample since no well-defined band absorption edge was observed due to its near continuous absorption in the UV-vis region.
To gain a deeper insight into the electronic structure of the synthesized materials, all samples were analysed by XPS. Fig. 5a and b shows the survey spectra of the pristine TNT and Co(5%)-TNT samples. The spectra of Co(1%)-TNT and TNT/Co(5%) (Fig. S4, ESI†) samples are similar to that obtained for Co(5%)-TNT.

In addition to the Na 1s, Ti 2p, and O 1s photoelectron peaks typical for the TNT (Fig. 5a), the Co(5%)-TNT, Co(1%)-TNT, and TNT/Co(5%) XPS survey spectra show a Co 2p doublet peak (Fig. 5b). The high resolution spectra of Ti 2p (Fig. 5c), O 1s (Fig. 5d), and Co 2p (Fig. 5e and f) regions for Co(5%)-TNT, Co(1%)/TNT and TNT/Co(5%) are presented in Fig. 5.
The XPS spectrum of the TNT sample shows the Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks at 458.641 and 464.441 eV, respectively (Fig. 5c). An identical profile was observed for the Co(1%)-TNT and TNT/Co(5%) samples (Fig. S4, ESI†). However, the Co(5%)-TNT sample shows a slight shift of these peaks to 458.241 and 464.157 eV, respectively, due to the higher Co doping level (Fig. 5c). For the TNT- and Co-modified samples, the doublet splitting energies of the Ti 2p peaks vary from 5.7 to 5.9 eV, which also agrees with the presence of titanium only as Ti4+ in all the samples.39,40 Indeed, no signals are perceptible in the 456.2–457.4 eV range which can be ascribed to Ti3+.41,42 The main peak in the O 1s core-spectra at ca. 530 eV (Fig. 5d) corresponds to lattice oxygen and has some contribution of the sodium Auger peak (Na KLL).
The high resolution spectra of the Co 2p region for the TNT/Co(5%) and Co(5%)-TNT samples are presented in Fig. 5e. Concerning the ion-exchange TNT/Co(5%) sample, the binding energies related to the Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 peaks are ∼780 and ∼796 eV, respectively. Also the satellite lines of these two peaks, which are characteristic of the Co(II) oxidation state, are clearly visible at higher energies. A comparative analysis of this spectrum with that of the doped Co(5%)-TNT sample shows a shift of the Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 peaks towards higher energies and a decrease of the respective satellite features, which indicate the existence of Co(II) and Co(III) oxidation states.43 These results are in accordance with those previously reported by Wu et al. and seem to support the assumption that during the hydrothermal process the precursor powders were firstly dissolved in NaOH solution before the formation of the TNT sheets.44,45 Accordingly, some ionic cobalt is dissolved, probably in both Co2+ and Co3+ oxidation states, remaining in solution afterwards and thus leading to Co-doped TNT samples with cobalt in two distinct positions: replacing some Ti4+ in the TiO6 octahedra and between the interlayers. Once the nanotube thickness is inferior to the XPS radiation penetration, the quantification of the cobalt content in the prepared TNT based samples was also performed. A cobalt content value of 1.7 at%, corresponding to a Co/Ti ratio of 6.38%, was estimated for the ion-exchanged TNT/Co(5%) sample. On the other hand, cobalt content values of 0.21 at% (Co/Ti = 0.83%) and 1.41 at% (Co/Ti = 6.26%) were obtained for the doped Co(1%)-TNT and Co(5%)-TNT samples, respectively. It is worth noting that the samples' Co content as determined by XPS is close to the samples' nominal Co content. Additionally, the Na+ content of the ion-exchanged TNT/Co(5%) sample is lower than the content of the doped samples, in accordance with the expected higher level of Na+/Co2+ substitution in the TNT interlayer structure of that sample.
3.3. Photo-induced hydroxyl radical production
Anticipating the use of the prepared materials as photocatalysts, the evaluation of their photocatalytic performances for the hydroxyl radical (OH˙) production, one of the most oxidative species in advanced oxidative treatments, was first studied. Terephthalic acid (TA) was used as a probe molecule and the generation and quantification of OH˙ were analysed by fluorescence spectroscopy, via the detection of the hydroxylated reaction intermediates formed. Fig. 6 shows the amount of intermediates (HTA) produced after 20 minutes of irradiation of TA/catalyst suspensions. All the tested samples demonstrated catalytic activity for this reaction, the Co(1%)-TNT sample being the best catalyst for the photo-induced hydroxyl radical production.
 Fig. 6  HTA concentration variation during 20 minutes of irradiation of a TA solution (3 mM, 150 mL) using 10 mg of each photocatalyst. 
Taking the TA photolysis performance as reference, an increase of 75.0% in the radical production was attained using the Co(1%)-TNT sample as a catalyst, while increases of 63.9% and 60.5% were attained for Co(5%)-TNT and TNT samples, respectively. The slight decrease in the OH˙ production observed for these samples after 20 minutes of irradiation can be explained by the partial photodegradation of HTA. Using the cobalt ion-exchanged TNT/Co(5%) sample, a relative increase of 46.4% in the reaction yield was observed. These results allow concluding that the cobalt doping leads to an enhancement of the TNT photocatalytic performance for this reaction.
They also agree with the published results, for which a catalytic activity enhancement is usually attributed to doped samples and is dependent on the metal substitution degree; lower metal substitution levels usually leading to better catalytic performances.46–48
3.4. Adsorption and photocatalytic studies
The photocatalytic ability of the pristine and Co-modified TNT samples for photocatalytic degradation processes of pollutants was examined by monitoring the degradation of several organic model compounds. To evaluate their photocatalytic flexibility, phenol, a more anionic compound – naphthol yellow S (NYS) – and a more cationic compound – brilliant green (BG) – were chosen as model pollutants. Due to their importance in heterogeneous photocatalytic processes, the adsorption characteristics of each catalyst/pollutant system, were investigated prior to the photocatalytic experiments and are summarized in Fig. 7. Contrarily to phenol and BG, the NYS did not show any affinity for adsorption either on the pristine TNTs or on the TNT modified samples. The immobilization of BG seems to be almost independent of the surface nature. Indeed, values between 374 and 354 mg g−1 were obtained for the TNT and Co(5%)-TNT samples, respectively.
 Fig. 7  Phenol, BG and NYS adsorption ability using pristine TNT, Co(1%)-TNT, Co(5%)-TNT and TNT/Co(5%) samples as adsorbents. 
Concerning the phenol adsorption, a value of 111.4 mg g−1 was obtained for the pristine TNT sample. Regarding the doped samples, the amount of adsorbed phenol increases from 223.6 to 347.2 mg g−1 when the nominal cobalt increases from 1% (Co(1%)-TNT sample) to 5% (Co(1%)-TNT sample). For the ion-exchanged TNT/Co(5%) a value of 265.2 mg g−1 was determined.

3.4.1. Organic pollutant photodegradation. 
To decide the most appropriate duration of photodegradation experiments for each pollutant, some preliminary photolysis runs were carried out. A period of 90 minutes was considered adequate for the 20 ppm phenol solution, a period of 45 minutes for the degradation of the 20 ppm NYS solution, and 45 minutes for the degradation of the 10 ppm BG solution.
3.4.1.1. Phenol. 
The photocatalytic efficiency of the pristine and Co-modified TNT samples, on the degradation of a 20 ppm phenol solution, was studied for 90 minutes (Fig. 8). Concerning the irradiation period, all the tested samples demonstrated ability to photodegrade this pollutant. After 30 min of irradiation, the phenol degradation was practically completed (98.3%) using the Co(1%)-TNT sample as a photocatalyst, which contrasts with the 83.8% of degradation achieved by the less catalytic sample, the pristine TNT powder. For the same irradiation period, photodegradation percentages of 93.9 and 87.6 were attained using the Co(5%)-TNT and TNT/Co(5%) samples, respectively. These results are in agreement with published studies corroborating that metal doping usually enhances the catalytic properties of the pristine material.46–48 It is interesting to highlight that the best results were accomplished by the sample with the lowest cobalt doping level.
 Fig. 8  Concentration of phenol versus time of irradiation using pristine TNT, Co(1%)-TNT, Co(5%)-TNT and TNT/Co(5%) samples as catalysts. 
Although the Co(5%)-TNT and TNT/Co(5%) samples are both catalysts for this degradation process, an additional time of 30 minutes was required to complete the phenol degradation using the Co(5%)-TNT sample, and 30 more minutes were required to attain an identical degradation level using the TNT/Co(5%) sample.
3.4.1.2 Brilliant green (BG). 
The photocatalytic efficiency of the TNT and Co-modified TNT samples on 10 ppm BG solution degradation was evaluated during 45 minutes of irradiation. For comparative purposes the dye photolysis was also evaluated. Fig. 9a depicts the dye spectra during irradiation, in the presence of the Co(1%)-TNT sample as a catalyst. As previously discussed, the extensive dye adsorption is easily confirmed by the intensity decrease of the 624 nm peak at t = 0 spectrum. As can be seen, during irradiation all of the characteristic dye absorption bands decrease gradually with time, which indicates a progressive degradation of the dye.
 Fig. 9  (a) Electronic spectra of a 10 ppm BG solution during 45 minutes of irradiation using Co(1%)-TNT as a photocatalyst and (b) concentration of BG versus irradiation time using the prepared samples as catalysts. 
Moreover, the disappearance of the lower wavelength absorption bands (typical for aromatic rings), for longer irradiation times, indicates the degradation of the by-products meanwhile formed. Fig. 9b depicts the BG degradation over the irradiation time, for all the samples tested. After 60 min of dark period, 74.5%, 70.4%, 73.5% and 73.5% of the initial dye were removed from solution by adsorption, using TNT, Co(5%)-TNT, Co(1%)-TNT and TNT/Co(5%) respectively, as adsorbents. These values suggest that BG adsorption is a non-selective process for this set of samples. After turning on the lamp all the samples demonstrated catalytic activity for the dye photodegradation reaction. After 20 min of irradiation, the best sample for the BG removal was TNT/Co(5%) with a 99.3% decrease on the dye concentration. The second best photocatalyst seems to be Co(1%)-TNT with 96.9% of removal. However considering that the Co(1%)-TNT sample adsorbs more dye then the Co(5%)-TNT sample, the dye degradation at 20 min is better for the latter catalyst (97.4%). Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that after 45 minutes the removal performances of all Co-modified samples were identical and better than that of the pristine TNT sample.
3.4.1.3. Naphthol yellow S (NYS). 
The photocatalytic efficiency of the prepared samples in the degradation of a NYS dye 20 ppm solution was tested during 45 minutes. For comparative purposes the NYS dye photolysis was also evaluated. Fig. 10a shows the electronic spectra of NYS in the presence of Co(1%)-TNT as a catalyst. As can be seen, the intensity of all the characteristic absorption bands of the dye decreases with increasing irradiation time, which indicates a gradual degradation of this pollutant. However the unexpected gap between the 10 and 20 minutes spectral profiles suggests the existence of two distinct stages during this process. This phenomenon was not observed for the photolysis and/or other catalysed experiments.
 Fig. 10  (a) Electronic spectra of a 20 ppm NYS solution during 45 minutes of irradiation using Co(1%)-TNT as a photocatalyst and (b) concentration of NYS versus irradiation time using the prepared samples as catalysts. 
The reduction of the NYS dye concentration during photo-irradiation, using TNT, Co(1%)-TNT, Co(5%)-TNT and TNT/Co(5%) as catalysts, is shown in Fig. 10b. Since no NYS adsorption occurs prior to irradiation, the adsorption period was not considered in the graphs. After 30 min of irradiation, the dye degradation was complete using Co(1%)-TNT as a photocatalyst. For the same period, a reduction of 74.3% of the NYS concentration was achieved using the Co(5%)-TNT sample, whereas only a reduction of 45% was attained using either the pristine TNT or the TNT/Co(5%) sample as catalysts.
After 45 min of irradiation, the use of the Co(5%)-TNT sample enabled achieving a reduction of 90.8% of the NYS concentration, but only a reduction of 66.5% and 60.0% of the dye concentration was observed when using the TNT/Co(5%) and TNT samples, respectively. Therefore, among the prepared samples the best catalyst for the NYS photodegradation is the Co(1%)-TNT sample. Longer irradiation times are required for the other three samples to accomplish the desired dye photodegradation process.
The overall analysis of the results obtained for the photodegradation of phenol, BG, and NYS strongly supports that the existence of Co as a doping element in the TNT crystal structure is more advantageous for the oxidative processes that lead to the degradation of the dyes than when cobalt is located between the TiO6 interlayers.
Taking into account the present results and the reported band structure calculations for Co-doped TiO2,49,50 a mechanism for the light-activated charge-transfer processes in the Co-modified TNTs is proposed in Fig. 11. Accordingly, the valence band (VB) of the Co-modified TNTs is derived primarily from O 2p-levels, the conduction band (CB) from the Ti 3d-levels, and the crystal-field split Co 3d-levels forming localized bands within the original bandgap. For Co-doped TiO2, Ha et al.49 estimated that the partially filled Co 3d band is located 2.2 eV below the conduction band. Therefore, when an aqueous Co modified TNT suspension is irradiated with energy greater than TNTs' bandgap energy, electrons (e−) and holes (h+) are generated in the semiconductor's conduction and valence bands, respectively, the Co 3d band increasing the availability of the photogenerated charge carriers. The photogenerated electrons could easily transfer to the adsorbed oxygen and a rapid formation of O2˙ species can occur. The formed O2˙ active species will participate in the photocatalytic oxidation processes, while the photogenerated holes will react with OH− or H2O oxidizing them to OH˙ radicals. The combined action of h+ and the other highly oxidant species, including OH˙, is responsible for the pollutant degradation.

3.4.2. Pollutant mixture photodegradation. 
Supported by the above-described results and considering that in real world the simultaneous degradation of several pollutants is required in numerous situations, the degradation of a mixture composed of phenol, naphthol yellow S and brilliant green was carried out. The Co(1%)-TNT sample was selected as a catalyst for this study since it was shown to have the best catalytic performance. The concentration of each pollutant in the mixture solution was identical to that used in each individual photodegradation study. The period of irradiation was extended to 150 min once the amount of catalyst used was also the same. The obtained results are depicted in Fig. 12. Considering first the photolysis experiments, it should be noted that the use of a pollutant mixture solution leads to a slower overall degradation process in comparison to that occurring in single solutions.
 Fig. 12  Comparative decrease of the phenol (a), BG (b) and NYS (c) concentration in a pollutant mixture solution, upon 150 minutes of irradiation, using Co(1%)-TNT as a catalyst and during photolysis. 
The phenol photodegradation rate was the process most negatively affected by the “mixture effect”. Actually, for a period of 90 minutes, 83.1% of phenol present in the single phenol solution was degraded via photolysis (Fig. 8) while a value of only 68.6% has been achieved for the pollutant mixture solution (Fig. 12a). Similarly, for 45 min of irradiation, 82.7% of the BG dye was degraded when in single solution (Fig. 9b), whereas only 72.7% was degraded when taken in the mixture solution (Fig. 12b). Also upon 45 minutes of irradiation, the photolysis leads to a degradation of 27.5% (Fig. 10b) and 16.7% (Fig. 12c) of the NYS dye in the single solution and in the pollutant mixture solution, respectively.
Considering now the photocatalytic experiments on the pollutant mixture solution, the Co(1%)-TNT sample demonstrated the catalytic activity as expected. After 150 min of irradiation, less than 1% of phenol, 1% of BG, and 26.4% of NYS remained in the mixture solution (Fig. 12a–c). During the photodegradation period, the pollutant that was faster removed from the solution was the BG dye (45 min, 97.5% degraded). To achieve an identical phenol degradation level, an irradiation time of 135 min was required.
It is interesting to notice that, during the adsorption period, the NYS present in the pollutant mixture demonstrated some ability to be adsorbed by the Co(1%)-TNT. Indeed, 16.5% of the dye was adsorbed, contrasting with the absence of NYS adsorption when used individually with the same photocatalyst, as previously described in Section 3.4 and shown in Fig. 7. This fact is more interesting if it is taken into consideration that a relatively smaller amount of solid was available for the simultaneous adsorption of three pollutants. Preliminary studies, involving the stepwise adsorption of these three pollutants, were performed and the results seem to indicate the occurrence of a multi-layer adsorption process, the NYS adsorption being dependent on the previous adsorption of BG. A systematic investigation of this phenomenon was not the goal of this work. However, the importance of these studies for the correct evaluation of the catalytic performances of materials should be carefully considered.
3.4.2.1. Kinetic studies. 
The pollutant photodegradation data previously discussed allow going further into the kinetics of the several degradation processes studied (Fig. 13).
 Fig. 13  Kinetics of the photodegradation reaction of phenol and of BG, in single solutions and in a pollutant mixture solution via photolysis (a and b) and using Co(1%)-TNT as a photocatalyst (c and d). 
The photocatalytic degradation rate of most organic pollutants follows the pseudo-first order kinetics: (1)where C is the pollutant concentration at time t, C0 is the pollutant concentration at time zero and kap is the apparent reaction rate constant. Therefore, by plotting ln (C0/C) versus t, the experimental data can be fitted by a straight line, whose slope is the apparent first-order rate constant kap. Fig. 13 shows the characteristic plots of the phenol and BG kinetic degradation processes, using either single solutions or a pollutant mixture solution, and for an irradiation period of 30 min.
The plots corresponding to the photolysis are shown for comparative purposes (Fig. 13a and b). It should be noted that no satisfactory fittings were obtained for the NYS dye photodegradation. The apparent first-order rate constants obtained for the photodegradation processes of phenol and BG in single solutions catalysed by the Co(1%)-TNT powders are kap = 0.130 ± 0.005 s−1 and kap = 0.109 ± 0.0043 s−1, respectively, the phenol in single solution being the faster pollutant to be degraded. The opposite occurs when one considers the pollutant mixture solution, the phenol degradation rate being kap = 0.035 ± 0.001 s−1, lower than that obtained for the degradation of BG, kap = 0.060 ± 0.005 s−1. It is also interesting to note that, when using Co(1%)-TNT as a photocatalyst, the differences between the kap values obtained for the single solutions and that deduced for the pollutant mixture solution (Fig. 13c and d) are larger than the difference between that values considering photolysis (Fig. 13a and b). These results reinforce the importance of the studies with pollutant mixture solutions for the accurate assessment of the photocatalytic performance of materials.

4. Conclusions
Titanate nanotubes modified by both cobalt doping and Co ion-exchange were successfully prepared by a hydrothermal method. The influence of the nominal cobalt doping level and the cobalt position in the TNT structure was studied. XRD, Raman and XPS data strongly support that Co doping was accomplished for the doped samples by Ti4+/Co2+ substitution in the TiO6 octahedra of the TNT crystalline structure, whereas the incorporation of cobalt between the TiO6 layers via the replacement of Na+ ions by hydrated Co ions occurred for the ion-exchanged samples. Beyond the expected doping by Ti4+/Co2+ substitution, structural analyses of the doped sample with a higher cobalt content (Co(5%)-TNT) suggest the co-existence of some cobalt ions between the TiO6 layers. This particular result seems to agree with the assumption that during the hydrothermal process the precursor powders were firstly dissolved in NaOH solution before the formation of the TNT sheets. Consequently, some ionic cobalt is dissolved, remaining afterwards in solution and thus leading to Co-doped TNT samples with cobalt in two distinct positions.
Although no perceptible influence of the Co ion position was observed on the morphology of the prepared samples, the optical behaviour of the Co-modified TNT samples is clearly dependent on either the cobalt ions substituting the Ti4+ ions into the TiO6 octahedra or replacing the Na+ ions between the TiO6 layers. The UV-vis spectra of the samples showed that all the Co-modified TNT samples absorb radiation in the visible region, Co(5%)-TNT being the one with a higher light absorption capability. The optical red shifts shown by the Co-modified samples may be attributed to the insertion of the Co 3d orbitals within the forbidden band and the subsequent charge-transfer transition between the d-electrons of the dopant and the conduction band of the TNT. For the Co-doped TNT samples, the UV-vis spectra also exhibit a typical absorption band associated with transition metal doped semiconductors which arises from charge transfer and d–d transitions of the metal. A comparative analysis of the optical behaviour of the doped and ion-exchanged samples also strongly suggests a co-existence of cobalt in the TiO6 octahedra and between the TiO6 sheets in the Co(5%)-TNT sample, in accordance with the XRD and Raman data.
The catalytic ability of these materials for the photodegradation of pollutants was also investigated. First, the catalytic production of the hydroxyl radical was evaluated. Subsequently, phenol, NYS and BG were used as model pollutants. Anticipating real world situations, photocatalytic experiments using a mixture solution of these three pollutants were performed. It was shown that the Co modified TNT materials (Co-TNT and TNT/Co) are good catalysts, the photocatalytic performance being dependent on the Co/Ti ratio and on the structural Co position. The Co(1%)-TNT doped sample showed the best photocatalytic activity for all the degradation processes studied.
