    , Accepted 22nd December 2020First published on 22nd December 2020AbstractTin-based ASnI3 perovskites have been considered excellent candidates for lead-free perovskite solar cell applications; however, our atomistic understanding of the role of the A-cations, namely, CH3NH3 (methylammonium, MA), CH3PH3 (methylphosphonium, MP) and CH(NH2)2 (formamidinium, FA), in the physical chemistry properties is far from satisfactory. For the first time, we report a density functional theory investigation of the MPSnI3 perovskite and non-perovskite phases as well as their comparison with the MASnI3 and FASnI3 phases, where we considered the role of the A-cation orientations in the structural stability of the ASnI3 phases. The orthorhombic structure is the most stable studied phase, which agrees with experimentally reported phase-transition trends. In contrast with the cation size and the weak hydrogen bonding interactions, which contribute to structural cohesion between the inorganic framework and A-cation, the dipole–dipole interactions play an important role to drive the structures to the lowest energy configurations. From our analysis, the inorganic framework dominates the optical properties, band structure, and density of states around the band edges. Broader absorption and smaller band gap energies occur for the perovskite structures compared to the low-dimensional hexagonal/pseudo-hexagonal non-perovskites.
1 Introduction
Perovskites have been recognised to have present and future prospects in the optoelectronics field, with applications including solar cells,1 light-emitting diodes,2 lasers,3 spintronics4etc. In addition to their cost benefits, perovskites have unique fingerprints such as high absorption coefficients, tunable band gaps and high charge carrier diffusion lengths.5,6 In a short time, the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of lead-based perovskite (APbX3) solar cells has increased from 3.8%7 to more than 25.0%,8 and there are solid expectations to reach the Shockley–Queisser PCE limit of 33.7% for a single junction cell.9,10 However, encapsulation and recycling procedures cannot eliminate dangers arising from the large-scale production of lead-based perovskites.11–13 Thus, the search for lead-free photovoltaic devices with long-term stability has attracted great attention in the last 10 years.
Among lead-free candidates, lead mono-replacement by tin has been shown to be a promising lead-free alternative due to the similar electronic properties of tin perovskites to their Pb-based counterparts. However, ASnX3 suffers a similar degradation process to Pb-perovskites, which has motivated a complete or partial replacement of the A- and X-sites of both tin and lead-based perovskites in order to improve the stability.14–20 However, tin-based perovskites present additional destabilizing factors like non-uniformity of films and a self-doping process induced by tin oxidation.21,22
All these factors have contributed to yield inferior device efficiencies of ASnX3 perovskites, and hence there is great interest to improve our atomistic understanding of A-cation effects on the structural stability of ASnI3 perovskites. A composition engineering strategy has been suggested to improve the physical properties of Sn-based perovskites.23 Moreover, intensive research has been done to overcome the stability and other limitations of 3D halide perovskites, such as the investigation of 2D,24–26 1D,27 and 0D28 low-dimensional perovskites.
Here, we employed Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the role of the A-cations, namely, CH3NH3 (methylammonium, MA), CH3PH3 (methylphosphonium, MP) and CH(NH2)2 (formamidinium, FA), in the structural-stability and optoelectronic properties of ASnI3 perovskites. To the best of our knowledge, we report for the first time a study on the properties of MPSnI3 perovskites, which have been considered under experimental study after the recent synthesis of MPSnBr3.29 To study the role of the A-cations in the structural stability and optoelectronic properties, we explored several orientations of the A-cations for different phases of ASnI3 perovskites, namely, cubic (C), tetragonal (T), orthorhombic (O) and hexagonal (H).
We found that the orthorhombic structure is the most stable phase for all investigated ASnI3 perovskites. The anisotropy of the A-cation plays a major role in the relative energy of the phases and octahedral distortions. Hydrogen-bonding interactions between the A-cation and the inorganic framework enhance the structural cohesion, hence the structural stability of ASnI3 perovskites. Conversely, the inorganic framework dominates the optoelectronic properties, and broader absorption spectra are expected for perovskite structures rather than hexagonal/pseudo-hexagonal non-perovskites. Further details are given in the results section.
2 Theoretical approach and computational details
2.1 Total energy calculations
Our calculations are based on DFT30,31 within the semilocal Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof32 (PBE) formulation for the exchange–correlation energy functional. To solve the Kohn–Sham (KS) equations, we employed the all-electron Projector Augmented-Wave (PAW) method,33,34 as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP),35,36 version 5.4.1. The monovalent A-cation in the ABX3 perovskites can be inorganic species (e.g., Cs, K and Rb) or organic molecules such as CH3NH3,37,38 which can rotate freely due to the weak binding with the crystal frame formed by the interconnected BX6 octahedra. Thus, to improve the description of the weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions in the hybrid lead-free ASnI3 perovskites, we employed the vdW D3 correction proposed by Grimme39,40 for all total energy calculations. Furthermore, for the lowest energy configurations, we employed the hybrid functional proposed by Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)41 to obtain an improved description of the fundamental energy band gaps.
A plane-wave cutoff energy of 473 eV, which is 12.5% larger than the largest recommended cutoff energy in the POTCARs for the selected species (H, C, N, P, Sn, and I), was employed for the expansion of the KS orbitals, except to obtain the equilibrium volumes, V0, which requires a higher cutoff energy, i.e., 842 eV, due to the slow convergence of the stress tensor as a function of the number of plane-waves. We optimized V0 of several crystal structures, namely, cubic, orthorhombic, hexagonal, and tetragonal, which have different shapes and sizes, and hence the Brillouin zones (BZ) are also different. To minimize the error in the relative energy among different structures, which is crucial to compare the energetic stability of structures with small energy differences, the integration of all BZs was performed using the same k-point density, i.e., 40 Å−1, which corresponds to a k-mesh of 6 × 6 × 6 for the cubic/pseudo-cubic structures, and different k-meshes for the remaining structures. Those convergence parameters were obtained by systematic convergence calculations, Section S3.0 in the ESI.† For additional properties, such as the density of states and optical properties, the k-point density was further increased to 80 Å−1.
For the self-consistent solution of the KS equations, we employed a total energy convergence criterion of 10−6 eV, and the equilibrium geometries were reached once the atomic forces on each atom were smaller than 0.010 eV Å−1. For the optical property calculations, we employed a CSHIFT parameter of 1 meV for the Kramers–Kronig transformation, which is important to obtain an accurate description of the optical band gap.

The arrows stand for different orientations of the A-cation in the inorganic framework cage, in which the Sn positions delineate the lattice parameters. For FASnI3, an experimentally reported tetragonal unit cell with two formula units42 was considered. 
2.2 Bulk crystal structures
We have the aim to acquire an atomistic understanding of the effects induced by the A-cations on the relative energy stability, and structural and optoelectronic properties of lead-free ASnI3 perovskites. Thus, we selected three A-cations, namely, MA (CH3NH3), MP (CH3PH3) and FA (HC(NH2)2), in which the effective radius increases from MA (2.17 Å) to FA (2.53 Å).43 The crystal structure of MASnI3 was identified by experimental X-ray diffraction as cubic (space group Pmm) at a temperature of 295 K, which undergoes a solid-to-solid phase transition to tetragonal (space group I4/mcm) at 140 K.44,45 Likewise, an increase in temperature induces a phase-transition in the crystal FASnI3 structure from the orthorhombic phase (space group Pnma) at 100 K to tetragonal (space group P4/mbm) at 175 K, and later to cubic (space group Pmm) at 275 K.42,45 However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no experimental characterization of MPSnI3 crystal structures.
The cubic, orthorhombic and tetragonal perovskite ASnI3 structures are based on the three-dimensional (3D) corner-sharing connectivity of SnI6 octahedra, whose unit cells differ mainly in the size and orientation of the A-cations and their dipole moments. To investigate the orientation effects of the A-cation on the SnI6 octahedral connectivity, we included a hexagonal non-perovskite phase within the P63mc space group, which was experimentally observed for FAPbI3.46,47 These ASnI3 hexagonal structures have two formula units (Z = 2) per unit cell and exhibit one-dimensional (1D) face-sharing SnI6 octahedral connections in the [001] directions and no octahedral connectivity in the [100] and [010] directions.
Overall, our procedure allows us to investigate the effects induced by the A-cation orientations, size, and dipole–dipole interactions in different ASnI3 polymorphs as well as the connectivity of the SnI6 octahedra. For each structure, we considered different orientations/alignments of the A-cations at the respective Wyckoff positions (Fig. 1). Along the stress tensor calculations, we employed constraints to preserve the Bravais lattice, e.g., for the orthorhombic structure it was required that a0 ≠ b0 ≠ c0 and α = β = γ = 90°. Regarding the pseudo structures, the pseudo-hexagonal structures were obtained without constraints, while the pseudo-cubic structures were obtained within angle constraints (α = β = γ = 90°).
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Relative energy stability
From Fig. 2, the orientations of the organic A-cations within the inorganic cage of the ASnI3 polymorphs are crucial to determine the energetic stability of the bulk configurations. The dependence of the energy on the cation orientations has also been observed for the lead-based counterpart (MAPbI3).48 In order to shed light on how the orientations influence the relative stability of the bulk configurations, we have investigated three main factors: the A-cation size, formation of hydrogen bonds, and dipole–dipole interactions.
 Fig. 2  Relative total energy, ΔEtot, in meV f.u.−1 of cubic/pseudo-cubic (C/PC), hexagonal/pseudo-hexagonal (H/PH), orthorhombic (O) and tetragonal (T) ASnI3 structures with various cation orientations, using the ideal cubic structure as the energy reference. The right column shows the volume per formula unit of the structures. 

3.1.1 A-cation size effects. 
We found that the equilibrium volume per formula unit increases from MASnI3 perovskites (e.g., average and standard deviation of 242.50 ± 3.16 Å3) to FASnI3/MPSnI3 (254.60 ± 5.07 Å3/253.23 ± 3.56 Å3), which is related to the increase of the steric radius of the A-cations from MA (2.03 Å) to FA (2.24 Å) and MP (2.38 Å).49 However, for a given cation the C–N(P) and N(P)–H bond lengths present similar values among the different polymorphs and, hence, suggest that the size of the cation does not play a significant role in determining the relative energy, Fig. S5 to S7 (ESI†), and the change of the cation does not affect substantially the trend of the relative energy among the polymorphs. Furthermore, the results indicate that other effects play a role in the equilibrium volume, as can be seen by the dependence of the volume on the orientation of the A-cations.


3.1.2 Hydrogen bonds. 
To analyse the effects of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) on the relative energy stability of ASnI3 polymorphs, we obtained all hydrogen–iodide distances within a cutoff distance of 3.5 Å, as well as the XHI angles (X = C, N or P). All perovskites follow the same trend, i.e., shorter and directional hydrogen–iodide distances are observed for the NH⋯I and PH⋯I moieties in comparison with CH⋯I, where the hydrogen-bonding distances of CH⋯I tend to be larger than 3.0 Å for all ASnI3, Fig. S27 (ESI†). Hence, with the N–I/P–I distances shorter than the C–I distances, the A-cations tend to be slightly displaced from the center of the unit cell towards the direction of the –NHx and –PH3 groups, which are features of weak H-bonds.50 However, since all polymorphs with lower and higher relative energies present the same trends, those weak H-bonds do not play a major role in determining the relative energy stability. Except for a few deviations, we found a linear relation between the XHI angles and the H-bond distances, in which the H-bond lengths are smaller when increasing the angles towards 180°.
Since the structural cohesion of ASnI3 depends on the attractive forces between the A-cations and the inorganic framework, the weak H-bonds also contribute to the structural stability. In particular, the planar FA-cation has four hydrogen donors from –(NH2)2 to stabilize the inorganic frame, while MA and MP have only three (–NH3 and –PH3). Hence, as observed from the absolute values of the cohesive energy in Table 1, the structural cohesion tends to be higher for FASnI3 than for the MASnI3 structures, which are both more cohesive than MPSnI3. This is in line with previous work which also reported a stronger interaction of the inorganic framework with FA rather than MA.51

Despite the geometric similarity between MA- and MP-cations, the hydrogen of –PH3 forms a weaker H⋯I bond, leading to weaker structural cohesion for MPSnI3. Indeed, by considering the absolute cohesive energy per hydrogen donor the MA > MP sequence is found, which agrees with the sequence we found for the shortest H-bonds of those moieties, Table 1. It has been shown from DFT and nonadiabatic ab initio molecular dynamics simulations that water molecules interact strongly with both the organic part and iodide ions by forming hydrogen bonding.52 In this sense, since water and oxygen molecules exert a negative effect on the Sn–I stability,53 due to their weaker structural cohesion, the MPSnI3 structures can be more affected by a moisture and oxygen-rich environment than MASnI3 and FASnI3.


3.1.3 Dipole–dipole interactions. 
Changes in the orientations of the anisotropic A-cations change the direction of the dipole moment, which affects the dipole–dipole interactions within the unit cells and its images, and hence it plays a crucial role in the relative energy of ASnI3 as for the lead-based counterparts.54 To gain insight on the role of cation substitutions in the dipole–dipole interactions, we calculated the dipole moments of isolated A-cation molecules, namely, 2.34 D, 1.95 D and 0.26 D for MA, MP and FA, respectively. Except for MP, which has no previously computed dipole moment to our knowledge, our results are in agreement with previously reported values for the MA- and FA-cations.54–57
In the ASnI3 structures, based on the structural analysis, the dipole moment cannot be canceled employing unit cells in the cubic and pseudo-cubic structures as those structures have only one A-cation per unit cell. Moreover, a null net dipole moment could be found in structures with more than one formula unit in the cell, but it is not observed in the hexagonal/pseudo-hexagonal structures because of the symmetry and dimensionality of the inorganic framework, where weak hydrogen-bonding H⋯I interactions induce the A-cations to orientate towards the inorganic layers.
As indicated in Fig. 3, the head-to-tail orientation of MA decreases ΔEtot for the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases of MASnI3 perovskites. On the other hand, the dipole moment of the MP- and FA-cations tends to have minor effects on ΔEtot of MPSnI3 and FASnI3. For instance, dipole moment cancellation occurs in the lowest energy tetragonal structure but does not occur exactly in the lowest-energy orthorhombic structure of MPSnI3 and FASnI3 perovskites.
 Fig. 3  The lowest energy cubic, orthorhombic, tetragonal and hexagonal structures of (a) MASnI3, (b) MPSnI3 and (c) FASnI3 perovskites. Relative total energies (in meV f.u.−1) are shown below each structure using the cubic structure as a reference. The numbers in parentheses represent the relative energy of the respective pseudo-cubic and pseudo-hexagonal structures. 
Nevertheless, cancellation of the dipole moment occurs for orthorhombic structures degenerate in energy with the lowest energy, i.e., with energies higher than the lowest energy by only 3 meV f.u.−1 and 6 meV f.u.−1 for FASnI3 and MPSnI3, respectively. The lower number of formula units in the hexagonal/pseudo-hexagonal and cubic/pseudo-cubic unit cells decreases the combination of relative A-cation orientations, which reduces the variability of the structures and, thus, the ΔEtot range among the structures. Thus, based on our analyses, the A-cation orientation and dipole–dipole interactions are important to drive the structures to the lowest energy configurations, which is not the case for the H-bonds and size effects of the cations.

3.2 Enthalpy of formation
The stability of hybrid perovskites is an important parameter to enable potential practical applications. Thus, to gain information on this matter we calculated the enthalpy of formation, ΔHof, which can help to understand the stability of perovskites.58 At T = 0 K, ΔHof is a direct measurement of the spontaneity of reactions, i.e., the standard Gibbs energy of formation. Here, the ΔHof values of the ASnI3 phases were obtained by considering the net conversion and the following equation of state: ΔHof = E(ASnI3(s)) − E(AI(s)) − E(SnI2(s)),(1)where E(ASnI3(s)), E(AI(s)), and E(SnI2(s)) are the total energies of the respective bulk compounds. The total energies of SnI2, MAI and FAI solids were evaluated upon the structural optimization of the respective experimental structures,59–61 while that of MPI was obtained by replacing Br for I in a recently synthesized MPBr(s) structure,29 and relaxing the geometry. The results are shown in Table 1.
The ΔHof values suggest a higher thermodynamic stability at 0 K for the MPSnI3 phases rather than the respective phases of MASnI3 and FASnI3 perovskites. Furthermore, stable formation for MPSnI3 is predicted in the present study in addition to the lead-based counterparts in other theoretical work;62–64 structure-wise, its stability can be more affected by moisture and extrinsic factors. Our results are in line with the observation that FASnI3 perovskites are more stable than MASnI3 upon illumination,65 because lower sensitivity to intrinsic and extrinsic factors is expected for more cohesive structures, and the cohesive forces between the organic cation and the inorganic framework may increase the stability of the structures, with FASnI3 more stable than MASnI3.
In the FASnI3 and MASnI3 perovskites, the orthorhombic structure occurs at lower temperatures, which is followed by the tetragonal and lastly by the cubic phase with increasing temperature.42,66 Hence, the highest stability of the orthorhombic phase predicted by our results at 0 K agrees with the experimental observation. For instance, the cubic and pseudo-cubic phases of FASnI3 are slightly unstable at 0 K. Overall, considering both the perovskite and non-perovskite phases, ΔHof varies from 0.09 eV f.u.−1 to 0.11 eV f.u.−1 among different phases. Due to the small difference in the stability among the phases, entropy effects can easily change the trend observed at low temperature, e.g., tetragonal or cubic being more stable depending on the temperature.
3.3 Structural properties
The effects of the A-cation's anisotropy, hydrogen bonds, orientation, and size influence the tilting of the SnI6 octahedra. To study how these effects manifest in the symmetry of the structures, we obtained the space group of the lowest energy perovskites through the FINDSYM program.67 We found that the orthorhombic phase of MASnI3 presents space group Pnma (point group D2h) and a−b+a− tilt (Glazer tilting notation).68 Although experimental studies did not report the space group of the orthorhombic MASnI3 phase,44,66 our results agree with experimental and theoretical studies of the orthorhombic MAPbI3 prototype,69,70 where the four MA cations have a well defined alignment. The MASnI3 tetragonal phase presented the same octahedral tilting and symmetry of the orthorhombic phase; therefore, due to the high dipole moment of the MA-cation, the anti-ferroelectric configuration (interlocked cation orientation) is favored by the DFT solution.
The FASnI3 orthorhombic structure seems to have different crystal forms, such as Amm2, Pnma and Imm2.42,46,71 We found that our lowest energy orthorhombic structure is degenerate in energy with a structure that has the Pbam space group, which is in line with experimental evidence.72 However, the reduced rotational motion of FA-cations at low temperature influences our lowest energy orthorhombic structure to present lower symmetry (i.e., the Cc space group). The inorganic frame of the tetragonal FASnI3 phase shows an octahedral-network tilting of a0a0c+ along the c-axis and satisfies the rules of the P4/mbm space group. These results provide important insights on the role of the organic cation in the tilting of perovskites. Due to the orientation of the MP-cation, the orthorhombic structure does not present the same a−b+a− tilting observed for MASnI3. However, the tetragonal structure has a−b+a− because of the anti-ferroelectric alignment of cations.
The random and free-cation orientation leads to a net spherical environment for the cation at high temperatures. However, since the freedom of the A-cations is reduced at low temperature, the frozen picture of the MA (the Schönflies symmetry is C3v), MP (C3v) and FA-cations (C2v) leads to symmetry reduction from Oh to P1 (generally) for all studied cubic/pseudo-cubic ASnI3 phases. The tilting of the SnI6 networks is linked to the octahedral distortions, such as Sn–I bond length anharmonicity (tin off-center), reduction of the tin effective coordination number (ideal ECNSn = 6) and the deviation of ISnI adjacent/diagonal bond angles of SnI6 from the ideal values of 90/180 (ΘISnI).
From Table 1, it can be seen that the cancellation of the dipole moment by the organic cation alignment contributes to reduce these distortions in the tetragonal phase, as well as in the orthorhombic phase of MASnI3. The impact of octahedral distortions can be better assimilated in the cubic and pseudo-cubic structures, in which the three diagonals of the single octahedron (distances between two non-adjacent iodide ions) are direct measurements of the a0, b0, and c0 parameters, which also correspond to the distance between adjacent tin cations. Hence, all factors that lead to the octahedral distortions will affect the lattice parameters, which will lead to the increase of the volume of the unit cell from orthorhombic, to tetragonal and finally to cubic.
In comparison with the available experimental data, the a0 and c0 lattice parameters of the MASnI3 tetragonal phase show small deviations from the experimental values (−0.69% and 0.00%, respectively),44 as also is the case for the parameters of the tetragonal FASnI3 structure, i.e., the errors are of 0.23/0.97% for the a0/c0 lattice parameters. For the cubic structures, our calculated lattice parameters listed in Table 1 are also close to the available experimental lattice parameters,42,44,45i.e., the theoretical–experimental difference is of only −0.32% and 0.64% for MASnI3 and FASnI3, respectively.
3.4 Charge density analysis
Here, to study charge transfer effects in the ASnI3 perovskites, we employ Bader charge partition analysis73,74 as well as the analysis of the charge density accumulation and depletion regions in the systems, focusing on the lowest energy ASnI3 structures. The effective Bader charges, QBeff, were obtained from the difference between the number of valence electrons of the neutral atom (Zval) and its respective Bader charge (QB), i.e., QBeff = Zval − QB, where the values for the A-cations are the sum of the Bader charges of their constituent atoms, and represent the net charge transfer within the cation, Fig. 4 and Fig. S29 (ESI†). Electron density difference plots were evaluated using the difference between the density of ASnI3 and its separated constituents, i.e., the inorganic framework and A-cations.
 Fig. 4  Effective Bader charge analysis for A, Sn and I-ion sites of the cubic/pseudo-cubic (C/PC), hexagonal/pseudo-hexagonal (H/PH), tetragonal (T), and orthorhombic (O) phases of MASnI3, MPSnI3 and FASnI3 perovskites. 
We found that the carbon atoms of the MA- and FA-cations work as charge donors to N, which also gains charge from hydrogen atoms of –NHx moieties. Due to the charge reduction of hydrogen, Coulomb attractions between those hydrogen atoms and iodide of the inorganic frameworks form weak H⋯I hydrogen bonds. Hence, due to the higher electronegativity of iodide in –N–H⋯I, a net charge transfer of approximately 0.75e, mainly from the NHx moieties to the inorganic framework, occurs in the majority of phases, as observed in previous theoretical work for the cubic MASnI3 perovskite.75
For MPSnI3 perovskites, since C is slightly more electronegative than P, it acts as an electron acceptor, and hence there is charge depletion in the PH3 moieties. However, the electronic coupling between the P and H orbitals leads to a slight charge accumulation on hydrogen atoms of –PH3. Hence, smaller effective charge transfer occurs from the hydrogen of –PH3 to iodide, which justifies the weaker H-bonds and cohesive stability of MPSnI3 in comparison with MASnI3 and FASnI3 perovskites. Overall, since the effective charges on Sn- and I-ions are close to 0.90e and −0.55e, respectively, the Sn–I bond lengths in the SnI6 octahedra are not purely ionic.
Additional evidence for the charge transfer and bond length character of SnI6 bonds was acquired through the density difference and Electron Localization Function (ELF) analysis, Fig. 5. As suggested by the Bader analysis, the charge transfer from the A-cations arises from the NHx and PH3 groups. Hence, our charge density analysis is in agreement with the strength of the H-bonds involving the hydrogen of those moieties. Moreover, as indicated by the electron localization function plots of Fig. 5, the Sn–I bonds of SnI6 moieties have an intermediate character between covalent and ionic for all studied ASnI3 perovskites.
 Fig. 5  Top: Electron density difference between the ASnI3 perovskites and frozen-isolated A and SnI3 fragments, where green and purple represent electron density accumulation and depletion, respectively. Bottom: Electron localization function along the tin-iodide planes, where the localization increases from blue to red in the color-filled map. The results for the remaining lowest energy phases are given in the ESI.† 
3.5 Optoelectronic properties
To achieve thorough comprehension of the optoelectronic properties of the lowest energy phases of ASnI3, as well as the role of the organic cation, we calculated the band structure, the density of states, and the absorption coefficient. The band structure and the local density of states for different angular momenta are shown in Fig. 6, which indicates that the band structures are dominated by the states of SnI6 moieties, i.e., by the overlap of Sn s-, Sn p- and I p-states. In the same energy range, which covers the range of photovoltaic interest, the lowest contribution of the organic cation states in the valence and conduction bands occurs for the MASnI3 phases. Indeed, the states of the MA-cation are not observed 4.00 eV below or above the valence band maximum (VBM). Moreover, the band structures of the frozen SnI3− framework have the most similar band shape to the MASnI3 bands, see Fig. S30 (ESI†). On the other hand, localized states of the organic cation occur below and above the VBM for FASnI3 perovskites, where localized N p-states occur almost 3.00 eV below the VBM and above a similar contribution of N p- and C s-states occurs near 2.00 eV. Particularly, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the hexagonal and pseudo-hexagonal structures has a small contribution of localized N p- and C s-states.
 Fig. 6  Band structure and density of states per ASnI3 formula unit for the cubic (C), pseudo-cubic (PC), orthorhombic (O), tetragonal (T), hexagonal (H) and pseudo-hexagonal (PH) MASnI3, MPSnI3 and FASnI3 phases. The valence band maximum (VBM) was set at 0 eV. 
The plots of the band structure and density of states show a high similarity among all perovskite structures, i.e., a small and direct fundamental band gap, mainly for structures of the same phase. On the other hand, larger indirect band gaps were obtained for all non-perovskite hexagonal/pseudo-hexagonal phases. The direct fundamental band gap of the cubic and pseudo-cubic structures occurs at the R point , while it is located at the Γ point  for the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases, with the exception of the tetragonal phase of FASnI3, which has the direct fundamental band gap at the Z point . Due to the higher dimensionality of the inorganic framework in the perovskite structures, the bands are more dispersive than the non-perovskites.
To obtain information on the charge carrier effective masses we calculated the effective masses of holes and electrons employing a parabolic fitting of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied bands. For the fittings, we considered 15% of the length of each k-point line around the band edges, Tables S8 and S9 in the ESI.† For instance, we found 0.128 m0 and 0.265 m0 for the hole and electron effective masses along the R−Γ line of the cubic MASnI3 perovskite, which are in good agreement with previous theoretical results at the DFT level75 or using the GW approach with spin–orbit coupling.76 Considering the overall average values, the non-perovskite hexagonal/pseudo-hexagonal structures have substantially larger hole effective masses than the perovskite structures, whereas the opposite trend is found for the electron effective mass. The variations in the hole effective mass among the perovskite structures are less significant when compared to the electron effective mass.
As indicated in Fig. 7, we calculated the absorption coefficient from the frequency dependent imaginary dielectric function. All ASnI3 perovskites have absorption coefficients higher than 105 cm−1, with the absorption onset in the near-infrared, covering the visible and going beyond the ultra-violet range in the case of the perovskite structures. However, the absorption onset of the one-dimensional hexagonal/pseudo-hexagonal structures occurs at higher energies, i.e., in the ultra-violet. In this sense, the non-perovskite hexagonal/pseudo-hexagonal phases are inadequate for solar cell applications due to their smaller absorption range as well as the larger direct band gap compared to perovskite structures, thus requiring higher excitonic energies (i.e., ultraviolet photons). The 3D connectivity of the inorganic framework is the key point for the higher and desirable absorption of perovskite-based solar cells. Another important point to consider 3D perovskite structures as an absorbing layer is the composition of sunlight at the earth's surface, of which about 52% is in the infrared region, and 43% in the visible-light range, while only about 5% corresponds to ultraviolet photons.77
 Fig. 7  Absorption coefficient as a function of the photon energy for the cubic (C), pseudo-cubic (PC), orthorhombic (O), tetragonal (T), hexagonal (H) and pseudo-hexagonal (PH) phases of (a) MASnI3, (b) MPSnI3 and (c) FASnI3 as well as for the corresponding frozen SnI3− inorganic framework. 
To further analyze the optical absorption of the ASnI3 perovskites, we obtained the optical band gaps, defined as the energy value at the onset of optical absorption. This analysis gives useful information about the possibility of dipole forbidden optical transitions in semiconductor materials.78 Here, all optical band gaps match the fundamental gaps, indicating that optical absorption at the smallest direct band gap is not hindered by symmetry considerations. Furthermore, previous work on the BSE method for the exciton binding energy of pseudo-cubic hybrid perovskites (ABX3; A = MA, FA; B = Sn, Pb; X = Cl, Br, I) reported that tin-iodide perovskites present the lowest exciton binding energies, which are of 9 meV and 1 meV for MASnI3 and FASnI3.79 Moreover, other work reported a smaller value of 8 meV for the exciton binding energy of tetragonal MASnI3.80
From the right side plots of Fig. 7, obtained by the evaluation of the absorption coefficient of frozen inorganic frameworks without the cations, we found a smaller effect of the organic cation on the absorption coefficient of ASnI3. Our results suggest that the organic cation can affect the optoelectronic properties (e.g., the absorption of solar cells) if it can change or break the inorganic connectivity. This is not the case of the MA, MP and FA cations, which are not so large in order to break the 3D connectivity of perovskites. Hence, the lack in our procedure of a description of disorder in the tetragonal, cubic and hexagonal phases is not a limitation to have good insights about the optoelectronic properties of tin-based perovskites.
In Table 2, we summarize the fundamental band gap obtained at the PBE + D3 level. For lead-based perovskites, error cancellations between the GGA and relativistic spin–orbit coupling gives good agreement between theoretical and experimental fundamental/optical band edges. However, due to the lower effect of spin–orbit interactions, the GGA-based functionals underestimate the experimental band edge of ASnI3 perovskites.81,82 The trends indicate that the fundamental band gaps of perovskite structures (SnI6 corner-sharing in a 3D connection) are closer to each other than the non-perovskite hexagonal/pseudo-hexagonal structure (SnI6 face-sharing in a 1D framework connection) due to the dimensionality difference. Regardless of the magnitude difference, our results suggest sensitivity of the band gap energy with respect to phase transitions.

Indeed, molecular dynamics simulations of the MASnI3 perovskite showed that the band gap increases from 1.02 to 1.25 eV with increasing temperature from 275 to 325 K.83 Overall, our band gap values are in perfect agreement with other theoretical work based on semilocal functionals,81,82,84–86 which have been experimentally estimated as 1.20 eV and 1.41 eV for MASnI3 (tetragonal) and FASnI3 (orthorhombic).46 Hence, the high-cost functional indicates better agreement than semilocal functionals, within only 0.05 eV below the experimental value of the tetragonal MASnI3 phase. Although the accuracy of the values can be improved with the increase of the exact exchange energy of Hartree–Fock,81,87 deviations can arise from the differences of the calculated and experimental structures. The DFT-1/2 method predicted a higher band gap energy than the experimental structures for the tetragonal MASnI3 (1.52 eV) and orthorhombic FASnI3 (1.54 eV) phases, but with low computational cost, similar to standard DFT.88
4 Conclusions
Based on DFT calculations, we found that the hydrogen bonds (H⋯I) are stronger for the hydrogen atoms of the polar –NHx and –PH3 groups rather than non-polar –CHx groups, leading to structural defects in the I–Sn–I moieties of SnI6 octahedra, including structures with an almost null net dipole moment. The dipole–dipole interactions play a crucial role in the relative stability of ASnI3 structures, in which the hydrogen bonds are present in lower/higher energy configurations. The stability of the perovskite-like structures agrees with the observed phase-transition sequence of orthorhombic to tetragonal and cubic structures, with the orthorhombic structure as the most stable at lower temperature. Overall, the A-cation affects the energetic and structural stability, but does not have a major effect on the optoelectronic properties.
Indeed, since the optoelectronic properties have a strong contribution from the inorganic frameworks, mainly of the I p-, Sn s- and Sn p-states, the effect of the organic cation can be considered as indirect and minimal, affecting mainly the lattice deformations, which do not break the inorganic framework connectivity. Moreover, the perovskite-like structures (cubic, tetragonal and orthorhombic 3D corner-connected SnI6 octahedra) present similar features regarding the electronic properties as well as the optical responses, which are clearly different from the one-dimensional faced-sharing SnI6 octahedra of the non-perovskite hexagonal structure. As a consequence of the dimensionality difference, the non-perovskite structures have larger fundamental/optical band gap energies and light-absorption onset in the ultra-violet range, while the perovskite-like structures present mainly a larger light absorption coefficient in the visible, which allows for higher harvesting of solar energy.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic unit cells of ASnI3 perovskites, where silver, purple and blue spheres represent the Sn, I and A-cation sites, respectively. The arrows stand for different orientations of the A-cation in the inorganic framework cage, in which the Sn positions delineate the lattice parameters. For FASnI3, an experimentally reported tetragonal unit cell with two formula units42 was considered.	 

 	Fig. 2  Relative total energy, ΔEtot, in meV f.u.−1 of cubic/pseudo-cubic (C/PC), hexagonal/pseudo-hexagonal (H/PH), orthorhombic (O) and tetragonal (T) ASnI3 structures with various cation orientations, using the ideal cubic structure as the energy reference. The right column shows the volume per formula unit of the structures.
