    , Accepted 21st September 2019First published on 23rd September 2019AbstractSpinel-structured NiCo2O4 nanosheets with dual-metal active sites, an ultrathin structure, and abundant oxygen vacancies were decorated for the first time on a nanoporous Mo-doped BiVO4 photoanode for PEC water oxidation. As expected, the NiCo2O4/Mo:BiVO4 photoanode achieved a remarkable photocurrent density of 4.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) under AM 1.5G illumination. These new findings provide a promising strategy for the design of dual-metal OER cocatalysts for enhancing the PEC performances of photoelectrodes.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting to produce hydrogen is a promising pathway for developing new energy sources.1–3 However, its practical application is still difficult because of the high overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and inefficient photo-conversion activity of semiconductor photoanodes.4,5 Recently, monoclinic bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has attracted great attention owing to its suitable band gap energy (∼2.4 eV) and favorable valence band position.6–9 Undesirably, the PEC water oxidation activities of BiVO4 photoanodes are still much lower than the theoretical expectation (7.5 mA), suffering from the high charge recombination and sluggish OER process at the electrode/electrolyte interface.10,11 Generally, the modification of OER cocatalysts is a crucial strategy for improving the PEC water oxidation performance by reducing the surface charge recombination, minimizing the overpotential and providing more active sites. For example, various OER cocatalysts, including CoPi,12 CoOx,13 Co3O4,14 NiOx,15 FeOOH and NiOOH,16,17 have been widely modified on BiVO4 photoanodes for enhancing the PEC performances. More recently, it has been extensively reported that compared with single OER cocatalysts, dual-layer cocatalysts exhibited more efficient PEC activity. For example, Choi et al. demonstrated for the first time that a BiVO4/FeOOH/NiOOH photoanode exhibited a photocurrent density of 4.5 mA cm−2 (1.23 VRHE) by creating a more favorable Helmholtz layer potential drop at the OER cocatalyst/electrolyte junction.16 However, note that the deposition sequences, thickness, and amounts of dual-layer OER cocatalysts play a crucial role in determining the PEC performances. Actually, dual-metal OER cocatalyst modified BiVO4 photoanodes have already been reported, and they generally possess an amorphous structure.18–20 Therefore, the development of dual-metal OER cocatalysts with high crystallinity may be a promising and practical strategy for promoting the water oxidation activities of BiVO4 photoanodes.
Spinel-structured nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4), in which Ni ions occupy octahedral sites and Co ions are distributed between both octahedral and tetrahedral sites, possesses much better electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity than single nickel- and cobalt-oxides.21–23 Moreover, owing to its superior physical and chemical stability, low cost, and natural abundance, NiCo2O4 has been extensively utilized as a promising electrode material for energy storage and conversion. For example, spinel NiCo2O4 nanoparticles were successfully applied as the hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells and a power conversion efficiency of 18.23% was obtained.24 Lin et al. reported that hierarchical NiCo2O4 hollow microcuboids exhibit excellent activity toward electrocatalytic overall water splitting, with a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 1.65 VRHE.25 In addition, NiCo2O4 nanostructures have also been utilized as photocatalysts for the degradation of methylene blue and photocathodes for PEC water splitting.26–28 Therefore, inspired by the outstanding photovoltaic, electrocatalytic and photocatalytic properties of NiCo2O4, its application as an OER cocatalyst may be a potential strategy for significantly improving the PEC performances of BiVO4 photoanodes.
Herein, we demonstrate a special dealloying method for fabricating ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets with dual-metal active sites and abundant oxygen vacancies, which have been utilized for the first time as an OER cocatalyst for promoting the water oxidation activities of BiVO4 photoanodes. As expected, the NiCo2O4/Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes achieved a remarkable photocurrent density of 4.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) light irradiation, which is much higher than that of the pristine BiVO4, NiO/Mo:BiVO4 and Co3O4/Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes, respectively. Further studies reveal that the ultrathin structure, dual-metal active sites and oxygen vacancies of NiCo2O4 cocatalysts could effectively promote charge separation and accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out to investigate the morphology and structure of the as-prepared NiCo2O4. As shown in Fig. 1A and B, the obtained NiCo2O4 exhibits folded nanosheet morphology with ultrathin features. To investigate the specific surface area and pore characteristics, N2 physical adsorption results are shown in Fig. S1.† It can clearly be seen that these ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets exhibit a relatively high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 53.24 m2 g−1 with an average pore size of 14.73 nm (Table S1†), which should be favourable for providing more catalytically active sites and increasing the semiconductor/electrolyte contact area.29 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shown in Fig. 1C clearly reveals that all the diffraction peaks could be well indexed to the spinel NiCo2O4 crystalline structure (JCPDS No. 20-0781), and no additional peaks arising from impure phases have been detected. Fig. S2† shows the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of ultrathin nanosheets, and the lattice spacing of 0.245 nm could be well indexed to the (311) crystal plane of NiCo2O4. Furthermore, their surface chemical states have been studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the high-resolution spectra of Ni 2p3/2, Co 2p3/2 and O 1s with Gaussian fitting are shown in Fig. 1D–F, respectively. Compared with bulk NiCo2O4 (Fig. S6†), ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets possess stronger Ni2+ and Co2+ peaks in the Ni 2p and Co 2p spectra (Fig. 1D and E), which may be due to the formation of oxygen defect sites.30 As shown in Fig. 1F, four peaks can be clearly identified in the O 1s spectrum, including lattice oxygen (OL, 529.7 eV),31,32 hydroxyl oxygen (OOH, 531.3 eV),33 vacancy oxygen (OV, 532.3 eV) and adsorbed oxygen (OH2O, 533.5 eV).34 Notably, a high proportion of OV peaks has been detected in ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets, further confirming their abundant oxygen vacancies. Generally, oxygen vacancies could be refilled by the oxidation process,35,36 and these ultrathin nanosheets were treated by H2O2 oxidation. As shown in Fig. S6,† the peak intensity of Ni2+, Co2+ and OV obviously decreased, suggesting that the number of oxygen vacancies was reduced dramatically. Moreover, the peak intensity of OH2O was also decreased due to the filling of oxygen vacancies, confirming that oxygen vacancies could reduce the adsorption energy of H2O, which is consistent with the previous literature.37 These results clearly reveal that spinel NiCo2O4 nanosheets with an ultrathin structure and abundant oxygen vacancies have been fabricated.

Owing to the novel ultrathin structure, abundant oxygen vacancies, and dual-metal active sites, their application as oxygen evolution cocatalysts in PEC water splitting should be promising. Thus, these spinel NiCo2O4 nanosheets were loaded on a nanoporous Mo:BiVO4 photoanode, and their morphology is shown in Fig. 2A and B. This photoanode was composed of worm-like nanoparticles with an average diameter of 200 nm, and the thickness is about 1 μm. However, compared with the pristine BiVO4 and Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes (Fig. S7†), no obvious structural changes have been detected, which should be attributed to their relatively low amount, wide dispersion and ultrathin thickness. Moreover, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. S8†) clearly reveals that except for the SnO2 peaks originating from the FTO substrate, all diffraction peaks could be well indexed to monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS No. 14-0688). However, no evident crystal structures and morphology features for the NiCo2O4 nanosheets could be observed in the NiCo2O4/Mo:BiVO4 photoanode, which is consistent with the TEM observation at low-magnification (Fig. S9†). Fig. 2C shows the HRTEM image of the NiCo2O4/Mo:BiVO4 sample, and the lattice spacing of 0.308 nm could be well indexed to the (121) crystal plane of BiVO4 (JCPDS No. 14-0688). Interestingly, an ultrathin disordered layer with a thickness of about 3 nm was uniformly coated on the surface of BiVO4 nanocrystals, which could be indexed to ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanolayers. In addition, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping clearly reveals that Ni and Co elements could be observed in the whole BiVO4 detection-region (Fig. 2D–J), further confirming the uniform dispersion of NiCo2O4 on BiVO4 photoanodes.

Their PEC water oxidation properties were evaluated in a 0.5 M KH2PO4 (pH = 7) electrolyte under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). For comparison, the PEC performances of pristine and Mo-doped BiVO4 photoanodes have also been tested. As shown in Fig. 3A, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves clearly show that compared with the relatively low activities of pristine BiVO4 photoanodes (0.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE), Mo-doping could effectively boost the PEC current up to 1.7 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. Amazingly, after the modification with ultrathin NiCo2O4 cocatalysts, the photocurrent density significantly increased up to 4.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, accompanied by a notable negative shift (0.1 VRHE) of the onset potential. Furthermore, the photoelectric conversion capabilities were evaluated by applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) analyses. Based on the LSV curves in Fig. 3A, the maximum ABPE of 1.2% at 0.78 VRHE was obtained using the NiCo2O4/Mo:BiVO4 photoanode, which is much higher than that of Mo:BiVO4 (0.2% at 0.97 VRHE) and pristine BiVO4 (0.09% at 0.9 VRHE) photoanodes (Fig. 3B) under the same conditions. The IPCE values of these three samples were obtained at 0.6 VRHE (Fig. 3C). At 350 nm, the IPCE value for the NiCo2O4/Mo:BiVO4 photoanode is around 33%, while only 2% and 4% have been obtained for pristine and Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes, respectively. In addition, the interfacial water oxidation kinetics was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the charge transfer resistance was exhibited by the arcs in the Nyquist plots. As shown in Fig. 3D, a much smaller arc radius was obtained for the NiCo2O4/Mo:BiVO4 photoanode under AM 1.5G illumination at 1.23 VRHE. According to the fitting results (Table S2†), the NiCo2O4/Mo:BiVO4 photoanode shows a remarkably decreased resistance (138.3 Ω) to charge transfer processes compared with Mo:BiVO4 (1560 Ω) and pristine BiVO4 (1907 Ω), confirming the significantly enhanced interface charge transfer efficiency resulting from excellent electrical conductivity of NiCo2O4. PEC overall water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen of the NiCo2O4/Mo:BiVO4 photoanode was conducted at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G illumination, and the H2 and O2 evolution amounts were measured by online gas chromatography (GC) every 20 min. As shown in Fig. S15B,† the amounts of H2 and O2 linearly increased when prolonging the light-irradiation time, indicating that a stable water splitting activity was achieved in this PEC system. The produced H2 amount is 66 μmol after 60 min, which is close to the theoretical amount of H2 calculated from Fig. S15A,† and the faradaic efficiency for water splitting in this PEC system is ∼89%. These results clearly reveal that the ultrathin NiCo2O4 could considerably improve the PEC water splitting activities of BiVO4 photoanodes.

Apart from the ultrathin structure and oxygen vacancies, the dual-metal active sites of NiCo2O4 nanosheets should also play a crucial role in enhancing the PEC properties. To further confirm this speculation, the PEC performances of Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes modified with single nickel- (NiO)38 and cobalt-oxide (Co3O4)14 cocatalysts have also been studied (Fig. S16†). As shown in Fig. 4A, the photocurrent densities of Co3O4/Mo:BiVO4 and NiO/Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes are about 2.8 and 2.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, respectively, which are far below that of the NiCo2O4/Mo:BiVO4 photoanode (4.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE). Moreover, the electrochemical OER performances of NiO, Co3O4 and NiCo2O4 were measured in 1 M KOH in the dark to further explore the effect of dual-metal active sites on the catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 4B, a smaller overpotential and a steeper water oxidation current density could be observed for the NiCo2O4 sample, demonstrating that it exhibits better oxygen evolution activities than single nickel- (NiO) and cobalt-oxide (Co3O4) catalysts. In addition, NiCo2O4 exhibits a smaller semicircle in the EIS curves (Fig. S17†), revealing the favorable charge transfer kinetics at electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Fig. 4C shows the results of photo-luminescence (PL) spectroscopy, which is a powerful technique for exploring the recombination processes of photogenerated excitons.39 It can be clearly seen that the NiCo2O4/Mo:BiVO4 photoanode shows a much smaller PL intensity than both NiO/Mo:BiVO4 and Co3O4/Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes, reflecting a higher charge separation efficiency. Furthermore, time-resolved PL spectra have been measured to reveal the lifetime of the photoinduced charges. As shown in Fig. 4D, the NiCo2O4/Mo:BiVO4 has a longer charge lifetime (48.04 ns) than NiO/Mo:BiVO4 (21.72 ns) and Co3O4/Mo:BiVO4 (25.59 ns) photoanodes, corresponding to a slower charge recombination under the excited state. These results clearly reveal that NiCo2O4 with dual-metal active sites could greatly promote the surface charge separation as well as the water oxidation process.

All samples were excited with 355 nm light from a pulsed laser. 
On the basis of the above results, a possible mechanism to clarify the effects of ultrathin NiCo2O4 on the significantly improved PEC performance is presented in Scheme 1. When the NiCo2O4/Mo:BiVO4 photoanode was irradiated with simulated sunlight, the photogenerated holes favorably transfer from Mo:BiVO4 to the reaction interface because the ultrathin thickness of NiCo2O4 nanolayers leads to a short hole diffusion path, and oxygen vacancies could facilitate hole migration. Owing to the high oxidation of holes, high-proportioned Ni(II)/Co(II) was oxidized to Ni(III)/Co(III), which was further oxidized into Ni(IV)/Co(IV) by holes. Then, the unstable Ni(IV)/Co(IV) was reduced to the Ni(II)/Co(II) state during the water oxidation process. Thus, Ni/Co dual-metal active sites and the ultrathin structure in this system could provide more active sites for the surface reaction, and the abundant oxygen vacancies can lower the adsorption energy of H2O, facilitating hole transfer and thus accelerating the OER kinetics.

In summary, we demonstrated a facile strategy for rationally constructing ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets with dual-metal active sites and oxygen vacancies to significantly improve the PEC performance of BiVO4 photoanodes. More specifically, the NiCo2O4/Mo:BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a remarkable photocurrent density of 4.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5G irradiation, which is about more than 7 times higher than that of pristine BiVO4 photoanodes (0.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE). In addition, the improved PEC performances should be ascribed to the dual-metal active sites, ultrathin structure and abundant oxygen vacancies of the NiCo2O4 OER cocatalyst. This work may provide new insights into the design and synthesis of dual-metal OER cocatalysts for applications in PEC systems.
