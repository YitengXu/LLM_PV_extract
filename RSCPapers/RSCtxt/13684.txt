    , Accepted 7th February 2022First published on 10th March 2022AbstractElectrochemical CO2 reduction integrated with renewable electricity has been regarded as a promising approach for reducing CO2 emissions and producing value-added chemicals. However, the technical and economic benefits of C1- and C2-chemical production via electrolysis are still ambiguous, especially when performed in flow cells. In this study, life cycle and economic assessments are conducted to evaluate the energy impacts, environmental impacts, and economic benefits of various value-added chemicals (C1- and C2-) via electrochemical CO2 reduction based on flow cells. The results show that C2-chemical production has more positive energy impacts but more negative environmental impacts than C1-chemical production. C2H4 production has the lowest net energy ratio (NER) (1.19), followed by CH4 (1.56), C2H5OH (1.80), HCOOH (3.01), and CO (3.77). In contrast, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of C1-chemicals (CO: −0.6078 and HCOOH: −0.6130 t CO2-eq. per (t CO2 gas injection)) are the lowest. Besides, sensitivity analysis indicates that the NER and GHG emissions are mainly affected by cell voltage (Ecell), followed by the single-pass conversion (SPC) of CO2 and faradaic efficiency (FE). Moreover, economic assessments demonstrate that C2-chemicals have a higher net present value (NPV) but a longer payback time than C1-chemicals. Economic sensitivity analysis shows that reducing the electricity price and Ecell, as well as increasing FE, are effective pathways to promote the industrialization of this technology. This work provides a direction to promote the technical and economic benefits of electrochemical CO2 reduction via flow cells.
1. Introduction
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have grown by 1.3% between 2009 and 2018, reaching up to 37 gigaton CO2 per year.1 Suffering from the accumulation of GHG emissions, anthropogenic climate changes (e.g., global warming, drought, and extreme events) have become one of the greatest challenges in present society. To mitigate the climate changes and reach the goal of “carbon neutrality”, several efforts have been devoted to developing technologies of CO2 reduction and conversion, such as CO2 capture and storage,2 thermochemical CO2 conversion,3 biotransformation,4 photoelectrochemical CO2 conversion,5 and electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR).6 Among these various technologies, ECR combined with renewable electricity provides an effective approach to reduce GHG emissions, which can simultaneously produce value-added chemicals (e.g., CO,7 C2H4,8 and HCOOH9). Besides, this technology can fix CO2 at mild conditions (i.e., ambient temperature and pressure); therefore, it is regarded as a promising pathway to promote “carbon neutrality”.
Many studies have focused on the design of catalysts for CO2 reduction reaction and their reaction mechanisms using H-type cells, but ignored the importance of designing suitable electrolyzers and systems. Suffering from the low solubility of CO2 in aqueous electrolyte (33 mM at ambient temperature and pressure), ECR performed in H-type cells can only achieve a current density of <50 mA cm−2, which is much lower than that of industrial benchmarks (e.g., 200–500 mA cm−2 for CO production).10 Thus, flow cells with gas diffusion electrodes are introduced into the ECR to increase the performance by directly providing gaseous CO2 as the reactant, which significantly enhances the mass transfer of CO2 to the active sites of catalysts. Ren et al. reported that cobalt phthalocyanine mediated CO2 to CO with a high FE (>95%) at 150 mA cm−2 in a zero-gap membrane flow cell, and that the cell voltage (Ecell) was lower than 2.6 V.11 Arquer et al. presented an ionomer bulk heterojunction catalyst and achieved a C2H4 partial current density of 1.3 A cm−2 with a 45% cathodic energy efficiency.12 Wang et al. reported that a C2H5OH FE of 52% with a partial current density of 156 mA cm−2 was obtained on amorphous N-doped carbon/Cu catalysts.13 Zhang et al. showed an outstanding CH4 FE of 82% at 391 mA cm−2, representing the best performance for CO2-to-CH4.14 In addition, Xing et al. developed a Bi@Sn core–shell nanoparticle catalyst that achieved a HCOOH FE of 92% at 250 mA cm−2 and a high energy efficiency of 56%.15 These research studies demonstrated the industrialized feasibility and significant performance of ECR performed in flow cells.
However, it is still ambiguous which specific target product of ECR has a positive climate and energy benefits to the environment, especially based on the flow cells. Besides, the economic benefits of ECR performed in flow cells to various value-added chemicals are ignored, and which specific target product has a more positive economic benefit is also unclear. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an effective method to evaluate the technical impacts of specific processes or products and has been carried out in several research studies. For instance, Khoo et al. evaluated the potential environmental impacts of ECR to C2H4 in both small- and large-scale setups using LCA.16 Sternberg et al. compared the environmental impacts of C1-chemicals but ignored the C2+-chemicals.17 Thonemann et al. developed a methodology to evaluate the environmental impacts of ECR to formic acid from laboratory to industrial scales.18 Paulillo et al. presented a comprehensive LCA of HCOOH production via ECR using an ionic liquid as the electrolyte.19 Kibria et al. conducted a technoeconomic analysis of ECR to C1- and C2-chemicals but ignored the environmental impacts.20 Although several studies have conducted LCA analysis to evaluate the environmental impacts of one specific target product, few reports focus on the technical and economic assessments of different target products (i.e., C1- and C2-chemicals) of ECR, especially based on flow cells.
Hence, LCA and economic assessments are carried out to evaluate the energy impacts, environmental impacts, and economic benefits of ECR to C1- and C2-chemicals. The two main attributes of ECR in the environment are reducing greenhouse gas emissions and producing value-added chemicals. In this work, the net energy ratios (NER) and GHG emissions are investigated to assess the energy requirements and environmental impacts, respectively, without giving any consideration for other key environmental impacts (e.g., acidification potential, eutrophication potential, and human toxicity potential). Economic benefits are evaluated by quantifying the net present value (NPV). In addition, the sensitivity analyses of the key parameters were carried out, such as the cell voltage, the FE of the products, the single-pass conversion rate of CO2 (SPC), current density, electricity price, cost of CO2, and cost of target products. This work provides a comprehensive comparison of ECR to C1- and C2-chemicals based on flow cells from technical and economic analyses and offers a new perspective for chemical production by ECR from the industrial feasibility direction.
2. Methods
2.1 Evaluation methodology
Based on ISO 14044 guidelines, the LCA of various value-added chemicals production (i.e., CO, CH4, HCOOH, C2H4, and C2H5OH) via ECR were performed using OpenLCA.21 A consensus framework (i.e., goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, impact assessment, and interpretation phase) is provided from the ISO guidelines. According to the requirement of materials and energy in this consensus framework, the Centrum voor Milieuwetenschappen Leiden (CML) method was followed to evaluate the environmental impacts.21 Besides, all data in this study are derived from recent academic resources about ECR to value-added chemicals using flow cells.
2.2 Goal and scope definition
This work aims to evaluate the differences in energy requirements, potential environmental impacts, and economy of chemical production (i.e., CO, CH4, HCOOH, C2H4, and C2H5OH) via electrochemical CO2 reduction based on flow cells. According to several recent lab-scale studies of electrochemical CO2 conversion using flow cells, CO, CH4, HCOOH, C2H4, and C2H5OH are regarded as the end chemicals. The system boundaries of C1- and C2-chemical production via ECR are shown in Fig. 1, including the processes of CO2 absorption, CO2 desorption, CO2 compression, electrolysis, and separation.
 Fig. 1  System boundary of C1- or C2-chemical production via electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. 
To compare their differences intuitively and exclude the variations in chemical fuel yield, we define one ton CO2 injection as the functional unit with 2018 as the base year. The reasons for this selection are shown as follows. The main contribution of the technology of ECR is reducing CO2 emissions. Besides, selecting the input variable, per ton of CO2 injection, as the functional unit has the same effect as output quantity (i.e., per MJ chemicals production). When it is determined, the actual amount of CO2 injection derived from coal-fired power plants (i.e., per ton of CO2 injection), the amount of CO2 injected into the electrolyzer can be decided by calculating the efficiency and GHG emissions during capture and compression. Moreover, in this work, lab-scale data about electrolysis are derived from recent articles, which show that C1- and C2-chemical production delivers different performances as shown in Table 2. By-products under 5% FE are not considered in the analysis. Then, based on the amounts of CO2 injection into the electrolyzer, the energy output can be determined by calculating the lower calorific values of the C1- and C2-chemicals.

2.3 Life-cycle inventories

2.3.1 CO2 absorption, desorption, and compression. 
Flue gas (13 mol% CO2, 5 mol O2, 75 mol% N2, 7 mol% H2O, 400 ppm SOx, and 450 ppm NOx),22 derived from coal-fired power plants, is captured using monoethanolamine (MEA) through chemical absorption due to its low energy requirement and high CO2 capture rate. Specifically, flue gas is first sent to the absorber column through a draught fan and then CO2 was absorbed by MEA solution (30 wt%) in the column to form the enriched MEA solution. Then, the enriched MEA solution is sent to the stripper column, in which CO2 is desorbed from the enriched MEA solution with the input of thermal energy. The fan efficiency and specific energy requirement of the draught fan are set as 70% and 0.2196 GJ per t CO2.23 It is worth mentioning that the CO2 desorption process requires a large amount of thermal energy input. In this study, the thermal energy requirement for the CO2 desorption process is set as 3 GJ per t CO2.24 Finally, the released MEA with 90% efficiency of desorption is recycled to the absorber column. Besides, the CO2 capture efficiency is set as 90%.24 The high purity gaseous CO2 is condensed through polytropic compression and then supplied to the electrolyzer for further processing. The energy requirement (Wt,n) during polytropic compression is calculated based on eqn (1): (1)where k = 1.2 is the variable coefficient, R = 8.314 J (mol K)−1 is the gas constant, P1 = 210 kPa is the outlet pressure of the stripper column, P2 = 20 MPa is the storage pressure of CO2, T1 = 323.15 K is the outlet temperature of the stripper column, and n is the mole of gaseous CO2.


2.3.2 Electrolysis. 
In this study, it is assumed that ECR is performed in flow cells at an industrial feasible level (i.e., current density >100 mA cm−2).10 A typical flow cell has two chambers (i.e., cathode and anode chamber) that are separated by an anion exchange membrane. The anode chamber was circulated with 1 M KOH solution to support the oxygen evolution reaction that occurred on a nickel foam electrode. Humid gaseous CO2, as the cathodic reactant, was supplied to the cathode chamber. Then, CO2 was reduced to C1- or C2-chemicals at the catalyst surface combined with H2O and e−. The total energy requirement (J) for each unit is calculated based on eqn (2): J = UzF/FE(2)where U represents the cell voltage, F represents the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1), z represents the electrons transferred in the reaction, and FE represents the faradaic efficiency of one typical product.


2.3.3 Separation. 
Generally, the amount of CO2 feed is not reduced and escapes through the exit due to the limited mass transfer of diffusion in the flow channels. Thus, the SPC of ECR is lower than 30%25 and the gas products from the cathode always consist of 5–70% unreacted gaseous CO2.26 A large amount of energy is required to separate and recycle the unreacted CO2. The pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology, due to its low cost and high energy efficiency, has been widely used to separate gaseous mixtures.20,27,28 Thus, to obtain high-purity gaseous carbon-based fuels, PSA was applied for the separation of gas products in this study. The unreacted CO2 was sent to the electrolyzer and recycled after product separation. Moreover, distillation is an industrially used process for the separation of liquid products,1,17,20,28 and thus is used for the separation of liquid products in this study.

2.4 Economic analysis
NPV is usually used to perform economic analysis by evaluating whether a project can be profitable or not. NPV is calculated based on operating costs, time value of revenue, and others.29 In this study, to determine the capital costs of CO2 capture, we compared various approaches based on current studies, such as chemical adsorption28 and direct capturing of CO2 from the atmosphere.23 Chemical absorption using MEA is used for the CO2 capture process due to its relatively low energy requirement and high CO2 capture rate, and the cost of the capture process (i.e., absorption and desorption) is set as $ 70 per (t CO2).28
Besides, it is assumed that the process of converting CO2 to carbon-based fuels is performed in an electrolysis plant. The lifetime of the electrolysis plant and tax internal rate of return are 20 years and 10%, respectively.30 Current research on ECR using flow cells mainly focuses on lab-scale production. Considering the similarity of flow cells for ECR and alkaline water electrolysis, relevant data (per unit electrolyzer: 920 $ per m2) based on alkaline water electrolyzer models are selected to calculate the cost of the system.28 Based on current density and FE, the area of the electrodes is calculated (CO: 4431 m2, CH4: 17415 m2, HCOOH: 2006 m2, C2H4: 31077 m2, C2H5OH: 17507 m2).
Moreover, 100 t day−1 carbon-based chemicals (CO, CH4, HCOOH, C2H4, and C2H5OH) can be obtained based on the industrialization scale. The Department of Energy (DOE) reported that the electricity from the solar industry is dropped from 0.28 to 0.06 $ per kW per h in 2017 and predicted that cheap electricity (0.02–0.03 $ per kW per h) will be achieved in 2030 when combined with excess renewable energy.20 An electricity price of 0.04 $ per kW per h is achieved in this study. Moreover, we assumed that the maintenance costs and working time of the plants are 2.5% and 350 days per year, respectively. All of the supplements (e.g., electrolyte) and replacements (e.g., membrane and catalysts) are contained in the maintenance costs.
To enhance the utilization of CO2 and obtain pure gaseous carbon-based chemicals, PSA is used for gaseous product separation because of its low operating costs. Based on a recent study, the operating cost of PSA for electrochemical CO2 reduction is set as 1000 $ per d.28 In addition, distillation is usually applied to separate the liquid chemicals, such as alcohols and formic acid. The operating cost for liquid products through distillation is set as 6000 $ per d.31 In this study, further processes (e.g., transportation of chemicals) are not considered though these costs also have a great influence on NPV. Finally, NPV is recorded by combining FE, current density, cost of chemicals, and cell voltage.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Energy and environmental impacts
The requirements of energy (e.g., electricity) and materials (e.g., KOH production) are calculated to evaluate the differences of C1- and C2-chemicals in energy impacts. The mass and energy flow of ECR to C1- and C2-chemicals production during each process (i.e., CO2 absorption, CO2 desorption, CO2 compression, electrolysis, and products separation) are shown in Tables 1 and 2. NER represents the ratio of the energy input (e.g., electricity) to the energy output (i.e., chemicals), and a higher NER for one specific product means a higher energy input is required based on equal energy output. To be specific, the energy output is calculated by the lower calorific value of the chemicals. The lower calorific value of CO, CH4, HCOOH, C2H4, and C2H5OH are 12.64, 35.88, 19.67, 63.4, 26.77 MJ cm−3, respectively. Thus, the value of NER for ECR to C1- and C2-chemicals are calculated to assess their energy impacts, based on one ton flue gas injection.
The energy input and NER of different chemicals production via electrochemical conversion processes are shown in Fig. 2(A). Firstly, it is assumed that the energy input to the system (e.g., electricity supply) is positive (>0) and the energy output (i.e., C1- and C2-chemicals production) is negative (<0). All chemical productions have the same CO2 capture and compression processes; thus, ECRs to CO, CH4, HCOOH, C2H4, and C2H5OH production show equal energy requirements for the processes of CO2 capture (19.56 GJ per (t CO2 gas injection)) and compression (0.42 GJ per (t CO2 gas injection)). The greatest difference in energy input for the production of different chemicals can be ascribed to the processes of electrolysis and chemical production, which affect the NER finally. In the process of electrolysis, the energy requirements of ECR to CO, CH4, HCOOH, C2H4, and C2H5OH production are 13.91, 27.27, 15.21, 24.65, and 44.66 GJ per (t CO2 gas injection), respectively. Suffering from higher overpotential and lower faradaic efficiency (FE), C2-chemical production demands higher energy requirements during the electrolysis process compared to C1-chemical production. Moreover, for the chemical production process, the energy output of ECR to CO, CH4, HCOOH, C2H4, and C2H5OH production is −10.04, −32.67, −12.22, −40.44, and −38.48 GJ per (t CO2 gas injection), respectively. These differences in chemical production are caused by their different overpotential and energy requirements during electrolysis. It is found that C2-chemicals show higher energy output due to their higher energy density compared to C1-chemicals. The lowest NER of 1.19 is achieved in the production process of C2H4 followed by CH4 (1.56), C2H5OH (1.8), HCOOH (3.02), and CO (3.77). The result suggests that C2H4, as one important precursor (e.g., synthesis of polyethylene), has the most positive energy impact. In addition, long-chain hydrocarbons (e.g., C2H4 and C2H5OH) present lower NER values compared with the short-chain products (e.g., CO and HCOOH), indicating more positive energy impacts.
 Fig. 2  Energy (A) and environmental (B) impacts of C1- and C2-chemical production via electrochemical CO2 conversion. 
The global warming potential is closely related to GHG emissions, and thus GHG emissions are calculated to evaluate the environmental impacts of the production of different chemicals. Specifically, N2O, CH4, and CO2 are the main contributors to GHG emissions and their CO2 equivalence values are 265, 28, and 1, respectively, based on a time horizon of 100 years.34 Nevertheless, the consumption (e.g., combustion and synthesis) of C1- and C2-chemicals is not considered in the system boundary, and thus the contribution of CH4 to GHG emission is ignored. Fig. 2(B) and Table 3 shows the total GHG emissions of ECR to C1- and C2-chemical production. Obviously, ECR to HCOOH production has the lowest GHG emissions (−0.6130 t CO2-eq. per (t CO2 gas injection)), followed by CO (−0.6078 t CO2-eq. per (t CO2 gas injection)), C2H4 (−0.5518 t CO2-eq. per (t CO2 gas injection)), CH4 (−0.5378 t CO2-eq. per (t CO2 gas injection)), and C2H5OH (−0.4391 t CO2-eq. per (t CO2 gas injection)). The result shows that both C1- and C2-chemical production reveals positive environmental impacts (GHG emissions < 0), which are beneficial for the environment. Besides, owing to their high FEs (>90%) and low overpotential, C1-chemicals (i.e., CO and HCOOH) present lower GHG emissions than C2-chemicals (i.e., C2H4 and C2H5OH).

In summary, compared to C1-chemicals (i.e., CO and HCOOH), C2-chemicals (i.e., C2H4 and C2H5OH) with lower NERs seem to be more available as targeted products, though these C2-chemicals own higher GHG emissions due to their low FEs during the process of electrolysis. The short-chain hydrocarbons possess low energy density and a small market size,20 resulting in their limited application in present society. In contrast, C2-chemicals have a large market size and high energy density. For instance, C2H4, which is widely used in plastic production, is expected to have a projected market size of USD 159 billion in 2027 according to Globe Newswire.16 For HCOOH, its value of market size is only USD 878.7 million in 2027, far less than the former.16 In addition, CH4 production via ECR leads to higher GHG emission though it has competitive NER.
3.2 Sensitivity analysis
To further evaluate the influences of the variation of key parameters (i.e., Ecell, FE, and SPC), sensitivity analyses of different chemicals' production via ECR are investigated. Fig. 3(A) depicts the sensitivity analysis of the key parameters (i.e., Ecell, FE, and SPC) in NER. Obviously, the NER values of both C1- and C2-chemicals are significantly affected by Ecell and SPC of CO2. When Ecell increases by one volt, the NER values of CO, CH4, HCOOH, C2H4, and C2H5OH production increase by 0.39, 0.13, 0.31, 0.13, and 0.18, respectively. Besides, with the increase in SPC by 0.4, the NER values of CO, CH4, HCOOH, C2H4, and C2H5OH production decrease by 0.32, 0.09, 0.12, 0.07, and 0.10, respectively. Moreover, FE has the minimal effect on NER, especially for C1-chemicals. Upon increasing FE by 10%, the NER values of CO, CH4, HCOOH, C2H4, and C2H5OH production decrease by 0.07, 0.03, 0.05, 0.02, and 0.06, respectively. These results indicate that further efforts should be focused on the optimization of Ecell and SPC of CO2 to decrease the NER value of ECR for carbon-based fuel production.
 Fig. 3  Sensitivity analysis of the key parameters of the NER of C1- and C2-chemical production (A), and the effects of the variations of key parameters on the GHG emissions of C1- and C2-chemical production (B) via electrochemical CO2 conversion (Ecell: −1–+1 V; FE: −10%–+10%; SPC: −5%–+40%). 

Fig. 3(B) depicts the effects of the variation of key parameters on the GHG emissions of C1- and C2-chemical production via ECR. Except for C2H5OH, the GHG emissions of C1- and C2-chemical production are mainly affected by Ecell, followed by the SPC of CO2 and FE. For example, the GHG emissions of ECR to CO can be reduced by 0.0211 t CO2-eq. per (t CO2 gas injection) when the Ecell value decreases by one volt. With the optimization of the SPC of CO2 (+40%) and FE (+10%) for CO production, GHG emissions can be only decreased by 0.0169 and 0.0055 t CO2-eq. per (t CO2 gas injection), respectively. Differently, for ECR to C2H5OH production, both the FE and Ecell values play critical roles in the variations of GHG emissions. As the FE of C2H5OH enhances by 10%, the GHG emissions can be reduced by 0.0293 t CO2-eq. per (t CO2 gas injection). This is because the Ecell and FE values govern the energy efficiency of ECR, which are closely related to the energy requirements during electrolysis, and further affect the total GHG emissions of the whole system.
The results from the sensitivity analysis demonstrate that increasing the SPC of CO2 and decreasing the Ecell value are the two most important pathways to enhance the energy and environmental benefits. Specifically, increasing the SPC of CO2, different from other parameters (e.g., current density, FE, Ecell, and energy efficiency), received little attention up to now. Notably, several research studies have reported that the SPC of CO2 was usually lower than 10%,25 especially at high current densities. In a typical flow cell with membrane electrode assembly, continuous alkaline conditions are formed at the surface of the catalyst layer with the reduction of CO2 (CO2 + H2O + e− → CxHyOz + OH−). Therefore, except for the partially unreacted CO, amounts of gaseous CO2 react with hydroxide to form (bi)carbonate under alkaline conditions (CO2 + OH− → HCO3−, CO2 + OH− → CO32− + H2O), competing with ECR. Then, these formed (bi)carbonate ions are transported through the anion exchange membrane to the anode via electromigration and concentration-dependent diffusion, and further react with H+ to regenerate CO2 and H2O.35 The SPC of CO2 is related to the following process of product separation. This competing reaction with (bi)carbonate and the crossover of (bi)carbonate ions result in the low SPC of CO2, which means that high energy is required to support the process of product separation and reduce the energy and environmental benefits of the system. Recently, an article reported that an SPC of 68% was obtained through electrochemical CO reduction to C2H4, C2H5OH, and acetate using a flow electrolyte electrolyzer.36 Limited by the mass transfer of CO2 and the activities of the catalysts, the SPC of CO2 in the flow cell is dissatisfactory. Thus, more studies should be devoted to the design of electrolyzers to enhance the SPC and reduce the energy requirements during product separation. In addition, Ecell is also another key parameter that affects the NER and GHG emissions, particularly for C2-chemical production. With the decrease in Ecell, the ECR to C1- and C2-chemicals show more positive energy and environmental impacts. Ecell reflects the overpotential, which is influenced by catalysts, electrode structures, electrolyzers, pH of electrolytes, and others. Therefore, to improve the competitiveness of ECR to chemical production, novel and cheap materials (e.g., M–N–C catalysts),7,37–40 electrode design (e.g., 3D porous electrodes),41–43 flow cells (e.g., membrane electrode assembly),44–47 electrolyte design (e.g., ionic liquid)48,49 should be focused. In addition, dispersibility,50 wettability,51 and hydration52 should be further explored to increase the performance of ECR to carbon-based chemical production.
3.3 Economic analysis and sensitivity analysis
To evaluate the economic benefits of C1- and C2-chemical production via ECR, an economic analysis was carried out. Firstly, the construction costs and NPV of these carbon-based fuels are calculated, as shown in Fig. 4(A). The system of ECR to C2H4 has the highest construction cost of 43.99 $ millions, followed by the system of ECR to C2H5OH (24.78 $ millions), CH4 (24.65 $ millions), CO (6.27 $ millions), and HCOOH (2.29 $ millions). Owing to the low FE (<70%) and low current density (<200 mA cm−2), C2-chemical production requires higher costs for electrolyzer construction which is in contrast to C1-chemical production. However, the NPVs of the systems of ECR to CO, CH4, HCOOH, C2H4, and C2H5OH production are 86.79, −80.85, 132.77, 116.25, and 194.38 $ millions, respectively. Except for CH4, all products indicate positive economic benefits. This negative NPV of CH4 production can be ascribed to the cheaper value of methane (0.18 $ per kg), followed by CO (0.60 $ per kg), HCOOH (0.76 $ per kg), C2H5OH (1.00 $ per kg), and C2H4 (1.32 $ per kg). In addition, the results depict that the NPV of C2-chemicals is more positive than that of C1-chemicals. High market price, large market size, and high energy density promote the economic benefits of ECR to C2-chemicals. For example, ethylene, as one of the most important precursors, is widely used in the polymer industry (e.g., the production of polyethylene). Moreover, the results indicate that the payback times of ECR to CO, HCOOH, C2H4, and C2H5OH production are 1, 1, 3, and 2 years, as shown in Table 4. It is suggested that C1-chemical production (i.e., CO and HCOOH) can achieve revenues faster than C2-chemical production (i.e., C2H4 and C2H5OH) because of the lower construction costs of ECR to C1-chemicals. The minimum-selling price of C1- and C2-chemicals is calculated, as shown in Table 4. It is suggested that the minimum-selling prices of ECR to CO, CH4, HCOOH, C2H4, and C2H5OH production are 0.26, 0.5, 0.22, 0.85, and 0.24 $ per kg, respectively, respectively. Compared to current market prices,20 both C1- (i.e., CO and HCOOH) and C2-chemical production (i.e., C2H4 and C2H5OH) deliver positive economic benefits.

To further evaluate the effects of key parameters (i.e., cost of products, electricity price, cost of CO2, current density, FE of products, and Ecell) on NPV, economic sensitivity analysis is performed as shown in Fig. 4(B)–(F). For C1-chemical production (i.e., CO, CH4, and HCOOH), the results indicate that NPV is mainly affected by electricity price and Ecell. For example, the NPVs of ECR to CO and HCOOH production can be increased to 97.57 and 139.05 $ millions with one volt reduction in Ecell value. Besides, the NPVs of CO and HCOOH production can be added up to 93.53 and 137.48 $ millions while decreasing the electricity price to 0.035 $ per kW per h. The cost of both products and CO2 have significant influences on the NPV of ECR to C1-chemicals. It is suggested that NPV can be enhanced to 91.86 (CO) and 137.84 (HCOOH) $ millions, respectively, when the costs of products reduce by 20 $ per t. Moreover, reducing the cost of CO2 is also an important pathway to increase the economy of the system. However, these optimizations (e.g., cell voltage) cannot change the negative economic benefits of CH4 production because of its low market price. For C2-chemical production from ECR, Fig. 4(E) and (F) show that the FE value of the product and current density have great influences on their NPVs, apart from the electricity price and Ecell. For ECR to C2H4 production, when the current density decreases by 100 mA cm−2, it presents an NPV of −433.84 $ millions. When reducing the FE of C2H4 by 10%, its NPV decreases to 90.456 $ millions. Moreover, a similar variation of NPV is found for ECR to C2H5OH production.
In summary, the economic analysis and sensitivity analysis indicate that ECR to C2-chemical production has more positive economic benefits, but requires high economic inputs initially. However, C1-chemical production has a shorter payback time, which can achieve revenues in a much faster time. Moreover, we conclude that Ecell and electricity price have the most important effects on the variation of NPV. Both of them govern the electricity inputs and the capital operation costs. Specifically, the Ecell value reflects the overpotential during electrolysis, which is affected by several factors, such as catalyst, ion concentration, pH, temperature, and structure. Furthermore, for ECR to C2-chemicals production, both current density and FE have critical roles on their NPVs, which can be ascribed to their lower performance compared to C1-chemical production. Thus, further studies of ECR should be focused on the material design (e.g., cheap and high activity catalysts), electrolyte design (e.g., ionic liquid), electrode design (e.g., interface engineering), and system optimizations. Moreover, to promote the application of this technology, renewable electricity (e.g., wind and solar)53 should be introduced in the system optimization which can extremely reduce the electricity price. Except enhancing the economy of the system, these optimizations can further reduce GHG emissions and thus contribute to mitigate global warming.
4. Conclusions
This research evaluates the technical and economic benefits of ECR to CO, CH4, HCOOH, C2H4, and C2H5OH production based on flow cells through life cycle and economic assessments. The results show that C2H4 has the most positive energy benefits and the lowest NER (1.19), compared to other C1- and C2-chemicals. Besides, C1-chemicals show more positive environmental impacts and lower GHG emissions (CO: −0.6078 t CO2-eq. per (t CO2 gas injection); HCOOH: −0.6130 t CO2-eq. per (t CO2 gas injection)) compared to C2-chemicals (C2H4: −0.5321 t CO2-eq. per (t CO2 gas injection); C2H5OH: −0.4391 t CO2-eq. per (t CO2 gas injection)). Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of key parameters indicates that NER and GHG emissions are mainly affected by the Ecell and SPC of CO2. Furthermore, economic analysis is carried out and the results show that the NPV of C2-chemical production is larger than that of C1-chemical production and that C2H5OH has the largest NPV (194.38 $ millions). Economic sensitivity analysis indicates that reducing electricity price, decreasing Ecell, and increasing current density can enhance the economy of ECR to C1- and C2-chemical production.
Although some studies reported that ECR to chemicals reached the industrial benchmark, this technology is still at its preliminary stage and is far to reach that of thermocatalytic technology. The latter (i.e., thermocatalytic technology) has been a more mature process and more appropriate for the current industrial system. However, with the development of electrolyzer and system design, ECR with 100% renewable energy can be more beneficial for the environmental impacts compared to the thermocatalytic technology. In addition, other technologies, such as photochemical transformation, are also green alternative pathways for reducing CO2 emissions and producing chemicals but deliver a low yield of chemicals due to their current lower performance compared to electrochemical transformation. In brief, this work provides a theoretical guide to develop a more energy-efficient CO2 utilization product by comparing the technical and economic benefits of electrochemical CO2 reduction to C1- and C2-chemical production based on flow cells.
