However, previous studies mostly focused on vertically stacked TMDC/perovskite heterostructures and only on relatively thick perovskites (over 100 nm), whereby a large imbalance between the thicknesses of the perovskite and TMDC monolayer exists, which hinders further exploration of interface interactions from a possible coupling between the two components.

A superior photoresponse compared to the isolated monolayer WS2 and CsSnBr3 films was demonstrated, which could be ascribed to the facilitation of the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs due to the formation of a type-II band alignment at the WS2/CsSnBr3 junction. Exciton dynamics analysis confirmed such carriers were transferring across the interface, especially an excessive receipt of holes in the monolayer WS2. The thickness of CsSnBr3 had a critical influence on the photoresponse, whereby 50 nm CsSnBr3 realized the optimal balance between the light absorbance and built-in potential effect. Our study provides a simple way to obtain TMDC/Sn-based metal halide perovskite photodetectors.
Introduction
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as WS2, MoS2, and WSe2, are considered as promising nanoscale materials for developing future ultrathin and energy-efficient optoelectronic devices, such as photodetectors, light-emitting diodes, and optical transistors, owing to their unique optical and optoelectronic features.1–3 In particular, TMDC monolayers normally possess a direct bandgap in the visible region and three-atom-thick ultrathin 2D structure, as well as displaying strong light–matter interactions, high carrier mobility, and superior flexibility, which make them superb candidates as sensing materials in photodetectors.4–6 However, the inferior light absorbance resulting from their atomically thin layer thickness is a huge obstacle for their photosensing application.5,7–9 Moreover, even for some TMDC monolayers, such as WSe2, with a high total light absorbance (10%) within the solar spectrum and long exciton diffusion length (150 nm), an inferior optoelectronic conversion efficiency may still be demonstrated in TMDC-based solar cells because of the high exciton binding energy in TMDC materials, which hinders the separation of the photoexcited electron–hole pairs.5,10–14 Therefore, integrating monolayer TMDCs with other materials equipped with a superb light absorbance coefficient and small exciton binding energy should be a possible route to realize superior nanoscale TMDC-based photodetectors. The application of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures via depositing a layer of material with a high optical absorbance coefficient on top of a TMDC provides an effective way to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of TMDCs in optoelectronics.
Perovskites with the formula ABX3, in which A, B, and X stand for an organic or metal monovalent cation, a divalent metal cation (e.g., Pb2+, Sn2+), and a halide anion (Cl−, Br−, or I−), respectively, are a family of direct bandgap semiconductors with strong optical absorbance in the visible spectral range and are considered as great candidates for next-generation solar cells.15,16 Due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties, including bipolar carrier transport, long carrier diffusion length, high charge mobility, and low trapping-state density, perovskites have recently been applied as absorbance layers for TMDC-based photodetecting devices.17,18 In such a strategy, the TMDC/perovskite photodetectors are not only equipped with the excellent photostability and exciton long diffusion length of the TMDC, but also with the high light absorbance and weak exciton binding energy of the perovskite, which provides a promising new route for the realization of high-performance photodetectors. So far, extensive investigations regarding the integration of TMDCs with organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites for photosensing have been performed.19–21 For example, the performance of a tungsten diselenide (WSe2) monolayer-based photodetector was improved by 3 orders of magnitude by the integration of methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) via laser healing. Furthermore, in a heterostructure of a monolayer of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, efficient hole transfer from the perovskite to the MoS2 monolayer within 320 fs after photoexcitation was demonstrated. However, the aforementioned hybrid perovskites with an organic functional group at the A site have significant drawbacks too, namely instability and moisture degradation.22
Metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) in which the A site is occupied by a sole monovalent metal cation have demonstrated superior photophysical properties in various optoelectronics applications.23 In particular, compared with the routine hybrid inorganic perovskite NCs, they are capable of revealing superior stability because of the absence of the active organic functional groups at the A site.24 Moreover, the common metal halide perovskite have lead (Pb) at the B sites for assuring a high optoelectronics conversion efficiency and tend to demonstrate a lower structural-defects density due to the stability of the Pb2+ ion. However, the toxicity of Pb can cause serious concerns that will likely limit the future application of Pb-based metal halide perovskite optoelectronics devices. Tin (Sn), which is in the same group 14 as Pb but has a benign nature, is widely considered as a promising candidate for replacing Pb in the B site of perovskite.25 Besides, metal halide perovskite NCs are normally fabricated by solution processing, such as spin-coating and drop-casting, due to its convenience and low cost, but can easily lead to poor uniformity, coverage, and crystallinity because of the rapid crystallization of the perovskite NCs during the solution processing.26 For photodetector applications, such morphological and structural flaws will promote a severe recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs and dramatically impede carrier diffusion, thereby resulting in an inferior photoresponse behavior. In particular, such instability is much more severe for Sn-based perovskite due to the easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+, called “self-doping”, because of the p-type dopant (acceptor) nature of Sn4+.27 Therefore, how to realize the suppression of such “self-doping” is critical for Sn-based metal halide perovskites, and it has been demonstrated that the reduction of “self-doping” is beneficial to increase the carrier lifetime and diffusion length for Sn-based perovskites, like CsSnBr3.28–30
For overcoming such obstacles laid by the solution processing, the physical vapor deposition (PVD) process, such as thermal evaporation, was introduced due to its own specific beneficial features, like compatibility with vacuum deposition in electronics devices fabrication, accurate control of the evaporation rate, and achievement of an ultrathin thickness.28 Moreover, it has been reported that two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets can reveal an increased exciton binding energy, enhanced absorption cross-section, and shortened PL lifetime compared to those of low-dimensional 0D and 1D perovskite NCs.31 In particular, lateral sizes up to several hundred nanometers can be realized, which will cause a high carrier mobility and diffusion length and is beneficial to perovskite-based photodetectors.22 Therefore, high-efficiency photodetectors could be obtained through enlargement of the metal halide perovskite NCs’ dimensional size. Meanwhile, vacuum annealing is an effective way not only for the generation of high crystallinity perovskite NCs due to the shortage of oxygen in the environment but also for increasing the NCs size.
Recently, vertically stacked TMDC/perovskite heterostructures with improved optoelectronics performance and ultrafast charge transfer were demonstrated.32–35 However, previous studies on these heterostructures were limited only to relatively thick perovskites (50–320 nm) obtained by either spin-coating, vacuum deposition, or mechanical exfoliation.17,35,36 Thus, there is a large imbalance between the thicknesses of the perovskite and TMDC monolayer in these vertical stacks, hindering further exploration of the interface interactions and the observation of new phenomena that might originate in a possible coupling between the two components. Moreover, in these TMDC/perovskite-based devices, normally Pb-based metal halide perovskite is applied and Sn-based ones have been seldom reported.
In this study, CVD-grown WS2/thermally evaporated CsSnBr3 heterostructures were fabricated and their photoresponse performance as well as their photophysical properties and morphological and structural characteristics were investigated. Robust WS2 triangular domains with an edge length around 120 μm were generated on Si/SiO2 via tuning the CVD process, while the apparent selective deposition of CsSnBr3 with a preferential (200) orientation on WS2 by thermal evaporation could be achieved. A superior photoresponse behavior compared to the isolated monolayer WS2 and CsSnBr3 films was demonstrated, which could be ascribed to the facilitation of the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs due to the formation of a type-II band alignment at the WS2/CsSnBr3 junction. Exciton dynamics analysis confirmed such carriers could transfer across the interface, especially through the excessive receipt of holes in the monolayer WS2. The thickness of CsSnBr3 had a critical influence on the effect of the built-in potential, and in our case the 50 nm CsSnBr3 realized the optimal balance between the light absorbance and effects from the built-in potential at the WS2/CsSnBr3 junction.
Experimental
WS2 nanosheets were fabricated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processing in a tubular furnace, as depicted in Fig. 1(a). WO3 and sulfur powder were placed in the positions at the center and at the near inlet gas entrance of a quartz tube, which was filled with inert nitrogen gas, and heated to temperatures of 830 °C and 150 °C, respectively. The size of the as-prepared WS2 nanosheets could be tuned by the reaction time, which was varied from 5 to 20 min. The CsSnBr3 perovskite films were fabricated by co-evaporation of the CsBr and SnBr2 source materials simultaneously. The CsSnBr3 films were annealed at a temperature of 75 °C during the thermal evaporation process, whereby in situ annealing was performed to form the crystalline CsSnBr3. The thickness of the CsSnBr3 films could be tuned via adjusting the thermal evaporation rates of CsBr and SnBr2. Photodetectors of WS2/CsSnBr3 with a planar structure were formed as shown in Fig. 1(b), with thermally evaporated Ag electrodes on Si/SiO2 substrates, whose width and length of the channel were kept at 20 and 100 μm, respectively. The Si/SiO2 substrates were ultrasonically cleaned by acetone, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and deionized (DI) water subsequently, and then dried by pure nitrogen (N2). All the CsSnBr3 films were fabricated in a multisource thermal evaporator (LiNing 386 SA organic multisource thermal evaporation system, Shenyang, China) with two separate chambers designed for organic and metal materials evaporation, respectively. The base vacuum of the chamber was kept at 2 × 10−4 Pa, and the thicknesses of the CsBr and SnBr2 were monitored by the respective quartz crystal oscillators. A detailed description of the fabrication procedure is provided in the ESI.†

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (JSM-6360LV), atomic force microscopy (AFM) (MFP-3D), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku 18 KW/D/max2550VB/PC) were employed for the respective analysis of the morphology and microstructure of the isolate WS2 and CsSnBr3 as well as the WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructures. The UV-vis absorbance spectra were recorded using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 950) and the steady-state PL was analyzed using a fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer LS55) with the excitation wavelength of 300 nm and in the range of 310–1000 nm. Time-resolved PL (TRPL) analysis was performed on an Edinburgh FLS1000 instrument with an excitation laser wavelength of 300 nm from a Xe lamp and at collection wavelengths of 638 and 680 nm. The photoresponse characterization was performed using a self-made system consisting of an arc lamp, grating spectrograph, reflection lens, probe station, and Keithley 4200A semiconductor analyzer. The incident power and wavelength could be modulated freely via adjustment of the grating spectrograph and reflection lens. It should be noted that the probe station was pumped by a mechanical pump to keep the photodetector in vacuum during the test. In our case, the incident light power was kept in the range of 0.075–0.375 mW cm−2 while the incident light wavelength was in the range of 330–900 nm.
Results and discussions
1. Morphology and structure of WS2/CsSnBr3
CVD-grown WS2 on Si/SiO2 revealed triangular domains, as shown in the AFM image in Fig. 2(a) and (c). It was noteworthy that the largest length of the triangular edge was around 120 μm, as shown in the FESEM image in Fig. 2(e), which was apparently longer compared to those reported elsewhere.17,37,38 The formation of the larger area WS2 domains not only indicated the effective tuning of the CVD process, but also benefited the further perovskite deposition and photodetector fabrication. The thickness of the WS2 domain was also measured via AFM, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a), and showed a thickness of around 0.7 nm, consistent with the thickness of monolayer WS2 widely reported.17,39,40 The 3D image of the monolayer WS2 is also shown in Fig. 2(a), which indicated a flatter surface of WS2 triangles and relatively rough surface of Si/SiO2 with randomly distributed particles. Details of the surface morphology analysis are listed in Table 1 and Fig. S1, S3, S4 in the ESI,† showing in particular how large humps appeared at the WS2 triangle edge. Such a phenomenon agreed well with the top view images shown in Fig. 2(a) and those particles should be ascribed to the nucleation sites of WS2 during the CVD processing. Apparently, the growth of monolayer WS2 domains was achieved by the extension of WS2 edges via continuous nucleation. Moreover, we also speculate that the atomically smooth and dangling-bond-free surface of WS2 reduces the diffusion barrier for the CsBr and SnBr2 precursors, allowing them to move fast enough to attach to a growing edge of the CsSnBr3 nucleus, thus promoting lateral growth to create a uniform CsSnBr3 layer. Such speculations can be supported by the report that the perovskite is capable of being deposited on WS2 by epitaxial growth, which also resulted from the clean and atomically smooth interface, which is beneficial for improving interfacial contact and interaction.41–44

Fig. 2(b) shows the surface morphology of the 50 nm thermally evaporated CsSnBr3 on Si/SiO2 substrates. Dense films with a thickness of around 49 nm could be found. It should be noted that a rougher surface (Ra = 2.758 nm) compared to that of the WS2 domains (Ra = 0.784 nm) was presented. Meanwhile, an obvious selective deposition of uniform CsSnBr3 on the surface of WS2 was observed. Although the exact mechanism for this selectivity is not fully clear, the higher surface energy of WS2 compared to the Si/SiO2 substrate may be a key factor leading to the selective growth of the perovskite.42,43 A similar behavior has also been observed for other metal halides.42–44 Dramatically different growth behaviors of CsSnBr3 on WS2 and Si/SiO2 were also revealed by the AFM images in Fig. 2(c) and (d). In particular for the case of 10 nm CsSnBr3, a triangular area with a smaller thickness of CsSnBr3 deposited following the shape of the WS2 domain together with the dense and closely packed CsSnBr3 grains on Si/SiO2 could be obviously observed. Meanwhile relatively sparsely distributed CsSnBr3 grains on WS2 compared to those on adjacent Si/SiO2 were illustrated after 50 nm CsSnBr3 deposition. It was noteworthy that the actual thickness of the 50 nm thermally evaporated CsSnBr3 on Si/SiO2 was around 49 nm, while the thickness of the CsSnBr3 film on WS2 was around 4 nm smaller than that on Si/SiO2, which could be attributed to the apparently different growth behavior of CsSnBr3 on WS2 substrates.
To further investigate the thickness of the CVD-grown WS2 grains, Raman spectroscopy was employed due to its superior capability to analyze and identify 2D materials. Raman spectra were collected from the CVD-grown WS2 and WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructure with various CsSnBr3 thicknesses and are shown in Fig. 2(h), in which all the samples showed peaks at 175, 351, and 418 cm−1, assigned to the LA, 2 LA, and A1g modes of WS2, respectively. Such a phenomenon demonstrated not only the successful synthesis of monolayer WS2 but also its robustness, because little variation of the Raman spectrum was observed after CsSnBr3 deposition. In particular, the remaining strong 2 LA peaks in the heterostructure indicated the intactness of the underlying WS2 monolayer. It should be noted that there should be Raman peaks at 118, 140, and 180 cm−1 corresponding to the characteristic F2g, Eg, and A1g modes of the pristine CsSnBr3, as shown in Fig. 2(h). However, the WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructures in our case did not seem to exhibit such characteristics peaks of CsSnBr3. Such a behavior might be ascribed to the overlapping of the dominant 180 cm−1 A1g mode of pristine CsSnBr3 with the 175 cm−1 LA mode of WS2, while the F2g and Eg modes of CsSnBr3 were too weak to be distinguished. However, the successful formation of CsSnBr3 on WS2 could be verified by the structural (XRD pattern) and photophysical (steady-state PL) analysis, as described later in the text.
To further investigate the surface morphology of the CVD-grown WS2 and WS2/CsSnBr3 on Si/SiO2 substrates, FESEM was employed and the images are shown in Fig. 2(e)–(g). It can be found that a WS2 triangular domain with the edge length around 120 μm was generated just like that shown in the AFM image in Fig. 2(a). Meanwhile, bright spots on the triangular edges could be observed, which was consistent with the large lumps on the WS2 edges as demonstrated by the AFM images in Fig. 2(a) and (d). It was noteworthy that in the red circle around the right corner of Fig. 2(e), we can clearly observe a small triangular WS2 domain with the center particle inside it. Such a phenomenon demonstrates the initial growth stage of the second layer WS2 on the previously monolayer WS2. Regarding the influence of the WS2 surface on the morphology of CsSnBr3, since the 0.7 nm thickness of the monolayer WS2 was quite low, together with the very low roughness of 0.972 nm as shown in Fig. 2(a) and Table 1, respectively, we believe that the effect of such a flat and thin WS2 monolayer on the morphology of subsequently grown CsSnBr3 with a relatively larger thickness (>10 nm) would be quite limited.
After 10 nm CsSnBr3 deposition, a totally different CsSnBr3 morphology on WS2 and Si/SiO2 was observed, as shown in Fig. 2(f). Island-like CsSnBr3 domains could be seen densely distributed on the Si/SiO2 substrates, while a CsSnBr3 film with nm-sized pinholes was generated on the WS2 triangular domains. Such a distinguished growth behavior agreed well with the AFM images shown in Fig. 2(c). Fig. 2(g) exhibits the FESEM images of the surface morphology of the 50 nm CsSnBr3 deposited on WS2 domains and Si/SiO2, whereby a dramatic difference is illustrated. Densely packed CsSnBr3 particles on Si/SiO2, as well as uniform CsSnBr3 film with randomly distributed particles on it, could be observed, which corroborated the selective growth of CsSnBr3 on WS2 as previously suggested based on the AFM images. Apparently, the CsSnBr3 perovskite preferred to form uniform films on the WS2 domains via lateral growth, while it just simply piled up and formed stacks on bare Si/SiO2, which led to its higher thickness on Si/SiO2 than that on WS2. It was noteworthy that the particles on the WS2 roughly with heights of 20–30 nm, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a), also had no obvious influence on the subsequent CsSnBr3 growth, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The underlying particles in the center and at the edge of WS2 simply protruded through the CsSnBr3 thin films and did not damage the dense CsSnBr3 films’ morphology.
Fig. 2(i) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of WS2/CsSnBr3 on the Si/SiO2 substrate. Two newly emerged peaks around 15° and 31° appeared, corresponding to the (100) and (200) faces of cubic CsSnBr3, which confirmed the formation of a cubic perovskite structure. It was noteworthy that the (200) preferential orientation of CsSnBr3 became dominant, while the (002) diffraction peak of WS2 gradually diminished with the thickness of CsSnBr3 increasing from 10 to 70 nm, indicating the dramatic improvement of the CsSnBr3 crystallization and fading influence of the WS2 beneath on the CsSnBr3 structure with increasing CsSnBr3 thickness, agreeing well with the uniform CsSnBr3 films on WS2 shown in the FESEM images.
2. Photophysical properties of WS2/CsSnBr3
For clarifying the influence of WS2 on the photophysical properties of CsSnBr3, UV-visible absorbance and steady-state PL analyses were performed. Fig. 3(a) and (c) show the UV-visible absorbance spectra for pristine CsSnBr3 with various thicknesses on quartz and Si/SiO2 substrates, respectively. Meanwhile, the absorbance of the Si/SiO2 substrate is also presented. From Fig. 3(a), we can observe that there was one prominent absorbance around 470 nm, corresponding to the band-edge absorbance for the pristine 50 and 70 nm CsSnBr3 on quartz, while CsSnBr3 with smaller thicknesses of 10 and 30 nm did not exhibit such apparent absorbance in the UV range, which could be attributed to the diminished absorbance for thin CsSnBr3 films. Moreover, a dramatically different absorbance behavior was observed for the CsSnBr3 films on Si/SiO2 substrates, as shown in Fig. 3(c). The UV-visible absorbance spectrum of the Si/SiO2 substrate revealed three dominant absorbances around 340, 520, and 1100 nm. The 10 nm CsSnBr3 revealed quite a similar absorbance performance to that of Si/SiO2, while the absorbance peaks obviously demonstrated a red-shifting with the increasing CsSnBr3 thickness on Si/SiO2. For further investigation of the mechanism leading to such a red-shift of the absorbance spectra, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations of the UV-vis absorbance spectra of CsSnBr3 with various thicknesses on Si/SiO2 and the isolated Si/SiO2 substrate were obtained via tuning the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k), and these are presented in Fig. 3(c) and (e). It can be seen that the simulated curves agreed well with the actual absorbance behavior, which demonstrated that the red-shifting of the CsSnBr3 absorbance peaks on the Si/SiO2 substrate resulted from the variation of the reflection and refraction of the incident light after the deposition of CsSnBr3 on Si/SiO2. Therefore, the shifting of the absorbance peaks was not related to any electronic structural change of CsSnBr3. Furthermore, WS2/CsSnBr3 (10 and 30 nm) on quartz revealed hybrid absorbance combining the values for WS2 (530 and 640 nm) and CsSnBr3 (around 470 nm), while the heterostructure with 50 and 70 nm CsSnBr3 could diminish the influence of the underlying WS2 due to the large thickness of the top layer CsSnBr3 (see Fig. 3(b)). Moreover, WS2/CsSnBr3 on Si/SiO2 exhibited quite a different absorbance behavior compared to that on quartz. In particular, the absorbance of WS2 on Si/SiO2 was consistent with that of pristine Si/SiO2, indicating that the influence from the Si/SiO2 substrate was overwhelming due to the thin monolayer thickness of WS2. Meanwhile, there was an apparent red-shift of the absorbance peaks initially around 340 and 520 nm with the increasing CsSnBr3 thickness, which could also be ascribed to the variation of the reflection and refraction of the incident light after the deposition of CsSnBr3 on Si/SiO2. Meanwhile, the energy bandgaps Eg of the isolated WS2 and CsSnBr3 were derived based on the absorbance observed on the quartz in Fig. 3(a) and (b) by Tauc plot, as shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI,† which gave Eg values of 1.81 and 2.63 eV, respectively, agreeing well with those previously reported.41 It was noteworthy that there were two absorbance peaks for WS2 on quartz as shown in Fig. 3(b) (530 and 640 nm), which correspond to values of 1.94 and 2.34 eV and indicated the two band-edge excitonic transitions of the 2D-WS2 monolayer. Such an absorbance behavior resulted from the spin–orbit (SO) split levels in the valence band and conduction band,45–48 which will be discussed in detail in a later section.

Fig. 3(f) compares the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra recorded on the isolated WS2 monolayer, isolated CsSnBr3 layer, and the WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructure with various CsSnBr3 thicknesses on Si/SiO2. It could be found that the monolayer WS2 and CsSnBr3 isolated layer revealed PL emissions at 640 and 670 nm, respectively, which were consistent with those reported in the literature.28,29,37,41 After 10 nm CsSnBr3 deposition, the WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructure exhibited both WS2 and CsSnBr3 PL emission, with an intensity ratio of 0.455 for ICsSnBr3/IWS2. With the increase in the thickness of CsSnBr3 to 50 nm, the PL emission ratio of ICsSnBr3/IWS2 is almost equal. A further increase in the thickness of CsSnBr3 to 50 nm leads to PL emission ratio of ICsSnBr3/IWS2 reaching 1.321, indicating an enhanced emission from the thicker CsSnBr3 layer. However, when the thickness of CsSnBr3 reached 70 nm, the PL intensities from both the WS2 and CsSnBr3 layers in the WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructure were dramatically quenched with the ratio of 0.901 for ICsSnBr3/IWS2. For the heterostructure of WS2/70 nm CsSnBr3, the PL intensity from the CsSnBr3 layer was quenched by a factor of 83.4% and from the WS2 monolayer by a factor of 80.8% compared to the PL intensity from the isolated layers, which indicated not only the good coupling between WS2 and CsSnBr3 but also the type-II (staggered) band alignment of the heterostructure at the WS2 and CsSnBr3 interface. The details of the steady-state PL intensity are summarized in Table 2. In a type-II heterostructure, the PL intensity of both components will be quenched because the photogenerated electron–hole pairs will be dissociated and transferred to different materials. The details of the photoresponse mechanism will be discussed in a later section.

For further investigation of the photoresponse behavior of the WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructure, especially regarding the possible carrier or energy transfer between WS2 and CsSnBr3, the PL intensity map collected from the isolated WS2 monolayer and WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructure on a Si/SiO2 substrate following excitation at 3.1 eV is shown in Fig. 4. Based on the absorbance spectra shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), the 3.1 eV incident photon was capable of generating electron–hole pairs in both CsSnBr3 and WS2. The PL intensity map indicated that the PL intensity of WS2 at 640 nm was obviously quenched after 10 nm CsSnBr3 deposition on it, while PL emission from CsSnBr3 at 670 nm was clearly demonstrated. With increasing the CsSnBr3 thickness to 70 nm, the PL intensity quenching at both 640 and 670 nm in the heterostructure area was overwhelming, which agreed well with the PL intensity performance shown in Fig. 3(f). The simultaneous PL emission quenching of both WS2 and CsSnBr3 not only demonstrated the type-II band alignment but also denied the possibility of any energy transfer between WS2 and CsSnBr3, which would lead to a PL emission enhancement of the materials receiving energy.

The electronic structure, including the positions of the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of the WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructure were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Fig. 5. The interface of the WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructure displayed a type-II band alignment; whereby, photoexcited electrons will transfer from WS2 to CsSnBr3 while holes will transfer in the opposite direction. The band offset, especially on the VBM side of ∼1 eV, provides a strong driving force to separate the photogenerated electron–hole pairs into different materials. Therefore, the CsSnBr3 can serve as not only an absorbing material but also a charge-transfer layer, which is very beneficial for WS2-based photodetectors. Meanwhile, WS2 could be a good candidate as a promising inorganic charge-transfer layer for perovskite-based photodetectors due to its superior stability and transparency.
 Fig. 5  XPS spectra of WS2 (a) and CsSnBr3 (b); energy band gap derived based on XPS and Tauc plot and UV-vis absorbance spectra. 
As we previously indicated there were two absorbance peaks (530 and 640 nm), which correspond to values of 1.94 and 2.34 eV and stand for the two band-edge excitonic transitions of the 2D-WS2 monolayer, which result from the spin–orbit (SO) split levels in the valence band and conduction band, indicated as VBM1, VBM2 and CBM1, CBM2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5(c). Upon photoexcitation, excitons are generated in both components of the heterostructure. Because the CBM of CsSnBr3 is lower than CBM1 and CBM2 of the 2D-WS2 monolayer, first, photogenerated electrons will transfer from WS2 to CsSnBr3. Second, on the VBM side, the hole driving force for VBM1 is larger than that for VBM2, which will lead to transfer from the VBM of CsSnBr3 to the VBM1 of WS2. Therefore, in the 2D-WS2 monolayer after photoexcitation, the remaining holes will not have sufficient electrons, while in the CsSnBr3, the remaining electrons will not have enough holes to recombine in to generate PL emission, leading to the simultaneous PL quenching of both components in the heterostructure. Third, the photogenerated electrons transferred to the conduction band of CsSnBr3 from WS2 will occupy the available states in the CsSnBr3 conduction band and therefore hamper the photogeneration of electron–hole pairs in the high absorbance CsSnBr3 and therefore the subsequent radiative recombination of photons, which will also lead to PL quenching from CsSnBr3. Fourth, the substrates in the heterostructure involving 2D-TMDC also have a tremendous influence on the carrier transfer due to the strong electronic doping induced by carrier transfer across the contact interface. It has been reported that the Si/SiO2 substrate is capable of realizing an electron-doping effect on 2D-MoS2 via electrons flowing to the monolayer MoS2 from the Si/SiO2 substrate.49 Therefore, in our case, the electron transfer from 2D-WS2 to CsSnBr3 was enhanced because of the Si/SiO2 substrates. Finally, it is noteworthy that the driving force for electron transfer was much smaller compared to that of hole transfer in the heterostructure based on the band offset in Fig. 5(c). Therefore, the dominant reason for the PL emission quenching of the heterostructure was hole transfer from CsSnBr3 to WS2.
To further explain the carrier dynamics in WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructures, TRPL spectroscopy was conducted to investigate the exciton decay behavior in heterostructures. Fig. 6(a)–(d) show the TRPL decay curves of the isolated CsSnBr3, isolated monolayer WS2, and WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructure with various CsSnBr3 thicknesses at 638 and 680 nm, corresponding to the PL emissions of WS2 and CsSnBr3, respectively. The detailed PL decay trace parameters are summarized in Table 3. For isolated CsSnBr3 films, all the TRPL curves could be well fitted by a biexponential function, in which the fast decay component could be ascribed to the surface recombination of electron–hole pairs while the slow component could be attributed to the edge state recombination.41,50 The exciton lifetime of the isolated CsSnBr3 increased from 2.15 to 4.64 ns at 680 nm with increasing the thickness from 10 to 70 nm, and was comparable to those reported in the previous literature,51 also manifesting the satisfactory quality of the thermally evaporated CsSnBr3 in our study. Such TRPL trace behavior was consistent with the PL behavior of the CsSnBr3 films, as shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI.† For the isolated monolayer WS2, the TRPL decay curve could be well fitted by a biexponential function, resulting in a lifetime of τ1 = 390 ps and τ2 = 3.08 ns, respectively, in which the fast decay could be attributed to many-body effects while the slow decay could be ascribed to the exciton radiative decay of WS2.52–54 The isolated WS2 revealed a PL decay life time of 1.92 ns, which is comparable with those previously reported.53 For the WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructure, all the TRPL curves could also be well fitted by a biexponential function, in which the fast decay component (τ1) resulted from charge transfer between CsSnBr3 and WS2 while the slow decay component (τ2) originated from recombination at the edge states.45 It was found that the PL decay life time at 680 nm, namely the emission from CsSnBr3, was diminished compared to that for the isolated CsSnBr3. Such behavior agreed well with the PL quenching of CsSnBr3 revealed in the previously PL emission mapping analysis (see Fig. 4). In particular for the cases with relatively large thicknesses of 50 and 70 nm CsSnBr3, the life time apparently decreased from 4.16 and 4.64 ns to 3.28 and 3.07 ns, respectively, indicating the dramatic PL quenching of CsSnBr3 in the heterostructure due to the holes transferring from CsSnBr3 to WS2. However, for the PL emission of the heterostructure at 638 nm, corresponding to the PL emission of WS2, the decay life time was obviously increased compared to the 1.92 ns for the monolayer WS2. In particular for the heterostructure with relatively large CsSnBr3 thicknesses of 30, 50, and 70 nm, the life time reached values over 3 ns. The mechanism of this might be ascribed to the dominant hole transfer from CsSnBr3 to WS2 due to the higher driving force compared to that for electron transfer from WS2 to CsSnBr3 (see Fig. 5(c)), generating an excessive receipt of carriers in WS2, leading to the extension of the excitons life time. However, because of the simultaneous loss of electrons from WS2 in the heterostructure, the recombination of the electrons and holes was still seriously hampered, leading to a quenched PL emission from WS2. Such a phenomenon should also occur at the CsSnBr3 side, but the electron receipt byCsSnBr3 was much limited compared to the hole receipt by WS2 because of the much smaller driving force for electron transfer from WS2 to CsSnBr3. Therefore, the exciton life time extension was not so serious for CsSnBr3. The aforementioned TRPL results confirmed the type-II heterostructure of WS2/CsSnBr3 and the strong coupling between CsSnBr3 and WS2 due to the clean and atomically smooth interface realized by the vapor deposition of CsSnBr3.

For further investigation of the carrier dynamics, investigations of the carrier mobility of the isolated WS2, isolated CsSnBr3, and WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructures were performed based on a MOSFET structure, in which the p-Si substrate was applied as the back gate while the other setup remained unchanged and as described in Fig. 1(b). A summary of the carrier mobility under dark and 330 nm photoexcitation conditions is presented in Table 4. It could be found that the isolated WS2 and CsSnBr3 both demonstrated a p-type behavior and the hole mobility upon photoexcitation was much larger compared to that under the dark condition due to the increase in the number of carriers after photoexcitation. It should be noted that the hole mobility increased with the increase in thickness for the isolated CsSnBr3 due to the enhanced light absorbance in thicker perovskite films from the increased number of carriers. Moreover, the heterostructures revealed dramatic improvements in hole mobility, especially for the case of 50 nm CsSnBr3. The hole mobility was elevated from 25.52 and 101.29 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1040.15 and 1675.08 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the dark and 330 nm photoexcitation conditions, respectively. Such apparently improved hole mobility was consistent with the photoresponse performance, as we discuss in a later section. Fig. S7(a) (ESI†) exhibits the Ids–Vg curves of the isolated WS2, isolated 50 nm CsSnBr3, and WS2/50 nm CsSnBr3 heterostructure upon photoexcitation at 330 nm while Fig. S7(b) (ESI†) reveals the Ids–Vg curves of the WS2/50 nm CsSnBr3 for the dark and 330 nm photoexcitation conditions in logarithm and linear scales, which demonstrated an obviously improved hole mobility of the heterostructure compared to those of the isolated WS2 and CsSnBr3. Such superior hole mobility could be ascribed to the existence of built-in potential resulting from the WS2/CsSnBr3 junction as described in Fig. 5(c). The details of the CsSnBr3 thickness dependence of the hole mobility of the WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructure under the dark and 330 nm photoexcitation conditions are illustrated in Fig S8 and S9 in the ESI.†

4. Photoresponse behavior of the WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructure
The WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructures were applied as photosensitive materials in a planar photodetector and an illustration and optical image of the planar structure on the Si/SiO2 substrate are presented in Fig. 7(a). Fig. 7(b) describes the dependence of the photocurrent (Iph = Iillumination − Idark) and responsivity (R) on the power of the incident light for the heterostructure of WS2/50 nm CsSnBr3 and the isolated 50 nm CsSnBr3 at a bias of 5 V. The responsivity (R) is an important figure of merit to assess the photoresponse performance of photodetectors, which is defined as R = Iph/P, where P stands for the effective incident laser power on the working area. Fig. 7(b) exhibits the dependence of the photocurrent and R on the incident power (at λ = 330 nm, U = 5 V), revealing a monotonical increase in the photocurrent and decrease in R with the increasing incident light power. Such a photoresponse behavior has been widely reported and normally ascribed to the serious recombination of photogenerated carriers under larger incident light power. Namely, the photocurrent scales sublinearly with the incident power, and therefore, R drops with increasing power. Comparison of the R values of the heterostructure and the WS2 monolayer demonstrated the apparent improvement of R from the heterostructure; whereby, at a light power of 0.75 μW mm−2, the R of the heterostructure reached 1.2 A W−1, which was almost double the value for the isolated 50 nm CsSnBr3 films and over 20 times larger compared to that for the isolated WS2. Such apparent improvements could be ascribed to the excellent light-absorption efficiency of the CsSnBr3 perovskite layer together with the improved charge carriers’ extraction efficiency due to the built-in potential at the interface between WS2 and CsSnBr3, which is beneficial to the generation and separation of photogenerated carriers. Details of the power dependence of the photoresponse are presented in Fig. S10–S13 in the ESI.†

The photocurrent (I)–voltage (U) curves at various incident light wavelengths (λ) (at an incident power of 3.75 μW mm−2) were obtained for the heterostructures with various CsSnBr3 thicknesses and for the isolated WS2, as shown in Fig. S14 and S15 in the ESI.† It could be found that the photocurrent demonstrated an obvious rectification photodiode behavior due to the existence of a Ag/CsSnBr3 Schottky junction. Fig. 7(c) reveals the incident λ-dependent photoresponse at a bias of 5 V (at a fixed incident light power of 3.75 μW mm−2) for the heterostructures with various CsSnBr3 thicknesses, and for the isolated CsSnBr3 and isolated WS2. It could be found that the heterostructure of WS2/50 nm CsSnBr3 demonstrated an obviously superior R compared to that of the isolated 50 nm CsSnBr3 in the λ range from 330 to 660 nm, with an optimal R of 1.6 A W−1 at 330 nm. Such a photoresponse behavior agreed well with the absorbance performance shown in Fig. 3(b), revealing the highest absorbance in the UV range. The superior R of the heterostructure could be ascribed to the formation of the WS2/CsSnBr3 junction, which facilitated the photogenerated carrier separation via the built-in potential at the interface, as described in the previous text. Meanwhile, not like in the case of 50 nm CsSnBr3, the isolated 70 nm CsSnBr3 exhibited a superior R compared to that of the WS2/70 nm CsSnBr3 heterostructure. Such a photoresponse could be ascribed to the greater thickness of CsSnBr3, which could screen out the influence of the underlying monolayer WS2. Therefore, for the 70 nm CsSnBr3, the junction of WS2/CsSnBr3 together with the built-in potential could be ignored. For the other heterostructures with 10 and 30 nm CsSnBr3 layers and for the isolated 10 and 30 nm CsSnBr3, the R was relatively inferior and the maximum R was below 0.5 A W−1 in the UV range, which may be attributed to the smaller CsSnBr3 thickness, leading to insufficient light absorbance.
For evaluation of the light-detection capability, the noise equivalent power (NEP) and specific detectivity (D*) were calculated at λ = 330 nm and power = 3.75 μW mm−2 and the details are explained in Table 5. It was found that the WS2/50 nm CsSnBr3 heterostructure demonstrated an obviously improved detection capability compared to the isolated WS2 and 50 nm CsSnBr3, whose NEP and D* values varied from 1.57 × 10−7 W and 2.01 × 1011 Jones (cm Hz1/2 W−1) for the isolated WS2 and 3.67 × 10−7 W and 8.62 × 1010 Jones for the isolated 50 nm CsSnBr3, to 1.50 × 10−7 W and 2.11 × 1011 Jones for the WS2/50 nm CsSnBr3 heterostructure, respectively, indicating the superior weak-light-detection capability of the heterostructure.

Besides, the temporal photoresponse of the isolated WS2 and 50 nm CsSnBr3 as well as the WS2/50 nm CsSnBr3 heterostructure was tested and the results are presented in Fig. 7(d)–(f). The rise time is defined as the time needed for the photocurrent to increase from 10% to 90% of the final value, while the fall time is defined as the time required for the photocurrent to drop from 90% to 10% of the initial value upon photoswitching. The photodetectors demonstrated good on–off switching with typical rise and fall times for the isolated WS2, isolated 50 nm CsSnBr3, and WS2/50 nm CsSnBr3 heterostructure of 0.53 and 0.89 s, 0.34 and 0.47 s, and 0.15 and 0.62 s, respectively, at incident light λ of 330 nm and power of 3.75 μW mm−2. It could be noticed that the rise time for the heterostructure apparently decreased while its fall time was comparable to those of the isolated CsSnBr3, indicating the obvious improvement of the on–off ratio upon the setting up of the heterostructure, which could be attributed to the generation of the built-in potential at the WS2/CsSnBr3 interface. Moreover, multiple repetition cycles could be performed, as shown in Fig. 7(g), demonstrating the robustness of such switching performance. Table S1 (ESI†) compares the photoresponse of our WS2/CsSnBr3 photodetectors with other Sn-based photodetectors in the literature. It can be found that our R was orders of magnitude superior compared to others, while the response time was either comparable or inferior. It should be noted that we applied simple planar structure photodetectors instead of routine vertical transistor structures for simplicity.
Conclusion
CVD-grown monolayer WS2/thermally evaporated CsSnBr3 heterostructures on Si/SiO2 substrates were obtained and displayed superior photoresponse behaviors compared to the isolated monolayer WS2 and CsSnBr3 films, ascribed to the facilitation of the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs due to the formation of a type-II band alignment at the WS2/CsSnBr3 junction. The simultaneous PL quenching from both WS2 and CsSnBr3, as well as the results from exciton dynamics analysis, confirmed carrier transfer across the interface, especially the excessive receipt of holes in the monolayer WS2 and leading to an abnormal extension of the excitons life time based on the TRPL results at 638 nm WS2 PL emission. The beneficial effect of the built-in potential on the carriers’ separation was also supported by the dramatically increased hole mobility of the heterostructure compared to that of the isolated CsSnBr3 and WS2 based on the transfer curves of the MOSFET. It was proved that CVD can achieve large-area monolayer WS2 domains with edge lengths over 120 μm, while the selective growth of thermally evaporated CsSnBr3 on monolayer WS2 with the (200) preferential orientation could be observed. A thickness of 50 nm for CsSnBr3 realized the optimal balance between the light absorbance in CsSnBr3 and the effects from the built-in potential at the WS2/CsSnBr3 junction, above which the effects of the built-in potential could be ignored. The Si/SiO2 substrates demonstrated an overwhelming influence on the absorbance behavior of the WS2/CsSnBr3 heterostructure. Our study provides a practical way to fabricate large-area TMDC/Sn-based perovskite photodetectors.
