    , Accepted 7th April 2020First published on 24th April 2020AbstractThe PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend is a kind of state-of-the-art non-fullerene photovoltaic blend. Herein, the effects of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) additives on the neat and blend film morphologies and the related ultrafast photophysical processes are studied. It is found that both DIO and CN can lead to an enhanced structural order in the in-plane direction and increased average lifetime of excitons in neat PBDB-TF films. The face-on orientation of PBDB-TF still exists in the DIO-processed PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend film, while in the case of the CN-processed blend film, molecular packing orientation is similar to that of the pristine blend film. The blend samples prepared with the two additives show increased initial exciton yields. Interestingly, in the blend samples prepared with the DIO additive, the recombination loss via the formation of polymer triplet excitons can be effectively suppressed, in comparison to the pristine and CN-processed samples. Both the DIO- and CN-processed devices show increased short-circuit current densities. The DIO-processed device is also found to have a superior fill factor due to suppressed recombination loss. The work provides a comprehensive insight into the ultrafast photophysical processes in varied blend morphologies induced by additives and their effect on the photovoltaic parameters of the devices.
1. Introduction
As a promising green and renewable energy conversion technology, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention over the past decades.1–5 Benefiting from the rapid development of non-fullerene acceptors, the BHJ PSCs have recently achieved great progress with the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single junction PSCs being continuously refreshed.2,6–8 In contrast to fullerene derivatives, the non-fullerene acceptors have the advantages of tunable absorption in the visible/near infrared region, tunable energy levels and charge-transporting properties, providing extensive opportunities for enhancing PCE when blended with well-matched donor polymers.9 It is known that the processing conditions of the active layer play a crucial role by manipulating the blend morphology and realizing high PCEs of the PSCs. Strategies including thermal and solvent annealing,10–17 mixed solvents18–20 and the use of solvent additives5,8,21–24 have been developed to optimize the blend film morphology. Among the various processing strategies, introduction of a small amount of solvent additives is a widely used and effective processing methodology to manipulate the donor:acceptor blend morphology in PSCs. Superior photovoltaic performance of the PSCs with an improved fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current density (JSC) has been achieved. For example, the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC:PC71BM ternary PSCs processed with 3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive exhibited the PCE of 14.08%,25 the PM6:PZ1 blend PSCs processed with 3% chloronaphthalene (CN) additive showed the best PCE of 11.2% among the all-polymer solar cells,26 and more recently, the non-fullerene acceptor-based PM6:Y6 blend solar cells processed with 0.5% CN additive pushed the PCE value to 15.7%.8 The impact of solvent additives on the blend morphology has been extensively studied through structural characterization, such as atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, resonant soft X-ray scattering, grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering/grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), etc.5,8,19,21–24,27–29 Typically, the enhanced photovoltaic performance is attributed to improved crystallization and donor/acceptor phase separation, and consequently the efficient exciton dissociation and improved charge transport and extraction. There is still a controversial issue regarding the effect of the solvent additives on the BHJ performance.21,23,30 The fundamental understanding on how the additives affect the ultrafast photophysical processes and consequently the photovoltaic performance of PSCs through varying the active layer morphology remains to be clarified.31 In PSC devices, absorption of photons by the active layer leads to the formation of excitons, which undergo ultrafast dissociation at the BHJ interfaces to produce charge transfer (CT) states and free charge carriers.30,32–35 The Coulombically bound CT states can be either separated into free charges by a field- or thermal-assisted process and successively extracted as photocurrent by overcoming bimolecular recombination or relaxed to the ground state via the geminate recombination process.30 The photophysical processes govern the charge yields and loss channels, which strongly affect the final photovoltaic performance of the devices. Understanding the underlying photophysical processes occurring in an ultrafast timescale for the blend films with different morphologies is essential to deeply understand the correlation between the blend morphology and the final photovoltaic performance of the devices. In recent years, the time-resolved femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopic technique has been used as a powerful tool to investigate ultrafast photophysical pathways occurring in PSCs during photoexcitation.36–45 The studies of the influence of the solvent additives on exciton dissociation and excited states dynamics in non-fullerene acceptor-based blends are rare.5
Here, we have investigated the effect of solvent additives on the neat and blend film morphologies and the related exciton and excited state behaviors by probing charge photogeneration and recombination dynamics in the typical PBDB-TF (also named as PM6):IT-4F photovoltaic system.46,47 The time-resolved spectroscopic characterization was carried out in order to figure out how the photophysical processes are varied upon using different solvent additives. The intrinsic exciton dynamics upon addition of additives in neat PBDB-TF and IT-4F films were also investigated. It is found that the average exciton lifetimes and exciton yields in the DIO or CN-processed neat PBDB-TF films are significantly increased with regard to the pristine neat film. The exciton yields are also increased in the additive-processed neat IT-4F films, but the average exciton lifetimes are almost unchanged. Correspondingly, the initial exciton densities in the additive-processed blend films are increased in comparison to that of the pristine blend film. The increased number of excitons and the prolonged exciton lifetime of PBDB-TF in the additive-processed blend films are favorable for excitons to diffuse and dissociate into charges contributing to a large photocurrent. It is also found that bimolecular recombination loss via the formation of polymer triplet excitons is suppressed in the DIO-processed blend film, leading to a higher FF in the resultant PSCs.
2. Results and discussion
The chemical structures of PBDB-TF and IT-4F are presented in Fig. 1. Polymer donor PBDB-TF possesses a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of −5.54 eV and a wide band gap of 1.89 eV. The narrow bandgap molecular acceptor IT-4F exhibits good complementary absorption with PBDB-TF and the PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1) blend film covers a wide range of 400–900 nm, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b). The offset of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) between PBDB-TF (−3.65 eV) and IT-4F (−4.15 eV) is 0.50 eV, which is sufficient for efficient electron transfer from PBDB-TF to IT-4F. Although the HOMO offset of the two materials is merely 0.04 eV (the HOMO of IT-4F is −5.58 eV), efficient hole transfer from molecular acceptor IT-4F to PBDB-TF still occurs and a similar status in other non-fullerene blends was also reported.48 All of the energy levels are taken directly from the literature.2

The effect of DIO and CN additives on ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the neat PBDB-TF and IT-4F films was firstly studied. UV-vis absorption spectra of the neat PBDB-TF and IT-4F films prepared with different solutions (chlorobenzene (CB), CB:0.5% DIO and CB:1% CN) are presented in Fig. 2(a). The selected contents of DIO (0.5%) and CN (1%) are based on the reported optimal values and our device results, respectively.2 In the case of neat PBDB-TF films, introduction of DIO or CN additive does not result in an obvious redshift in the absorption spectra. Similar to the case of PBDB-TF, the use of CN causes no apparent change of the spectral feature of IT-4F. Whereas, when it is processed with DIO additive, the IT-4F absorption spectra undergo an evident redshift and a slight intensity increase. These are attributed to the enhanced intramolecular charge transfer effect. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1) blend films exhibit an absorption spectra superposition of the neat components and show the same trend as the neat IT-4F films processed with DIO or CN additives. The PL spectra of the neat PBDB-TF and IT-4F films as well as the PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1) blend films prepared with different solutions (CB, CB:0.5% DIO and CB:1% CN) are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Interestingly, the neat PBDB-TF films prepared with DIO/CN additives exhibit dramatically increased PL intensity, which could be attributed to improved aggregation of the molecular chains. The non-radiative decay may be to some extent suppressed due to aggregation and thus the PL intensity is increased. The speculation is consistent with the trend of PBDB-TF exciton lifetime in different PBDB-TF films that will be discussed in the TA results below. The PL intensity of the neat IT-4F films processed with DIO/CN additive is also slightly increased. The sample prepared with DIO additive presents a redshift of PL spectra, which is in good agreement with its absorption spectra. It can be observed that the emission of all blend films is strongly quenched compared with the relevant neat films, implying efficient charge transfer in these blend films.
GIWAXS patterns were obtained to evaluate the effect of different additives on molecular stacking in the neat and blend films prepared with different conditions. The GIWAXS patterns of the neat PBDB-TF and IT-4F films as well as the PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1) blend films prepared with CB, CB:0.5% DIO and CB:1% CN solutions are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen in Fig. 3(a) that the pristine PBDB-TF film shows preferential (100) (alkyl stacking) diffraction in the out-of-plane (OOP) scattering direction and weak (100) diffraction in the in-plane (IP) direction. For the neat PBDB-TF film prepared with 0.5% DIO additive, the strong (100) diffraction in the IP direction and the obvious (010) (π–π stacking) scattering in the OOP direction are also present in addition to the slightly decreased (100) diffraction peak in the OOP direction. In the case of the CN-processed neat PBDB-TF film, the GIWAXS pattern is similar to those of the neat PBDB-TF film processed with DIO; however, the (100) diffraction intensity in the OOP direction is comparable to the pristine PBDB-TF film, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). These results point to the fact that the pristine neat PBDB-TF film prefers edge-on orientation. In contrast, the neat PBDB-TF films prepared with DIO/CN additives exhibit the coexistence of edge-on and face-on orientation as well as much sharper π–π stacking scattering in the OOP direction. These results indicate that a small amount of DIO/CN additive may strongly affect the aggregation and orientation of PBDB-TF in neat films. The lamellar d-spacing corresponding to PBDB-TF side chains is calculated to be ca. 19.75 Å in the pristine and DIO-processed neat PBDB-TF films according to the scattering data shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), while the value is slightly increased to 20.39 Å in the CN-processed film. The π–π stacking distance is 4.08 Å in the pristine PBDB-TF film and the value is reduced to ca. 3.72 Å in the neat PBDB-TF films prepared with DIO/CN additives. These results indicate that the molecular packing is more compact upon adding DIO/CN additives. The neat IT-4F film shows a slightly enhanced random distribution of (100) diffraction with the aid of DIO, as shown in Fig. 3(b), while in the case of CN-processed IT-4F film, the π–π stacking is not changed obviously compared with its pristine neat film. It is noteworthy that the PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1) blend film processed with CN shows a similar diffraction feature of a dominant (100) diffraction in the OOP direction to that of the pristine blend film. However, in the DIO-processed blend film, an obvious (100) diffraction is present in the IP direction accompanied by a strong (100) diffraction in the OOP direction. From these data, it is seen that the neat PBDB-TF film has a strong preferential edge-on arrangement with respect to the substrate. When it is processed with DIO/CN additives, an obvious face-on arrangement arises accompanied by a strong π–π stacking in the OOP direction, while in the case of the PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1) blend films, only the DIO additive can induce a strong (100) diffraction of PBDB-TF in the IP direction. It is likely that DIO and CN have different chemical structures so they selectively dissolve the side chains or the π-conjugated backbones of the active materials and result in different arrangements of polymer chains in the blend films. Similar results have been reported for DIO-processed blend films and the coexistence of both edge-on and face-on arrangements of conjugated materials is beneficial for 3D charge transport.8,19,49 Although higher crystallinity is a common indicator for the formation of better charge transport channels,4 it is not clear how the additives affect the charge generation and/or charge recombination by influencing the photophysical pathways of exciton dissociation and excited states dynamics via different blend morphologies.

TA measurements were performed to further explore the effects of additives on charge photogeneration and recombination dynamics in neat and blend films. TA measurements were conducted at low fluence to avoid annihilation effects. The neat PBDB-TF and IT-4F films were first studied to determine the exciton signal location and the intrinsic exciton decay dynamics as well as the additive effects. The selected TA spectra of the neat PBDB-TF films and the relevant spectral component kinetics of neat PBDB-TF and the exciton kinetics of the neat IT-4F films are depicted in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the TA spectra of the neat PBDB-TF films shown in Fig. 4(a)–(c) are dominated by the ground-state bleach (GSB) peaks at 580 nm/630 nm and a broad photo-induced absorption (PIA) band from 800 nm to 1400 nm. However, the spectra of the pristine PBDB-TF film evolve over time, while the spectra of DIO/CN-processed PBDB-TF films decay without obvious spectral evolution. Furthermore, the PBDB-TF films prepared with DIO/CN additives exhibit more structured GSB than the pristine PBDB-TF film, indicating that excitons and charged species preferentially occupy the ordered rather than the amorphous polymers.50 The broad PIA features can be ascribed to the inhomogeneous local environment and structural diversity of the films. All of the three neat PBDB-TF films show the maximum PIA around 1170 nm assigned to the PBDB-TF excitons. Moreover, the intensity of PIA signal located at 650–780 nm is greatly decreased in DIO-processed PBDB-TF film and this PIA band is absent with a negative signal instead in the case of CN-processed film. Since the spectral signals of GSB, the stimulated emission (SE) and PIA in this region are highly overlapped, it can be inferred that the SE intensity of the additive-processed PBDB-TF films is much stronger than that of the pristine PBDB-TF film, consistent with the steady PL intensity trend shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The TA kinetics of the neat PBDB-TF and IT-4F films are shown in Fig. 4(d)–(f) and their normalized results are plotted in Fig. 4(g)–(i). As is evident from Fig. 4(d), much stronger GSB signals (580 nm) are observed for the neat PBDB-TF films processed with DIO and CN, implying that the total densities of excited states in the films are higher than that of the pristine PBDB-TF film. The GSB kinetics and exciton kinetics of the DIO-processed PBDB-TF film are almost the same and follow a similar trend as those of the CN-processed PBDB-TF film. It is noted that the GSB and the exciton kinetics in additive-processed PBDB-TF films exhibit much slower decay than those of the pristine PBDB-TF film, which reveals the possible presence of the PBDB-TF polarons in additive-processed PBDB-TF films. It is also noted that the population of IT-4F exciton shows a significant increase in the DIO-processed IT-4F film compared to the pristine and the CN-processed IT-4F films. Interestingly, unlike PBDB-TF, the exciton kinetics of IT-4F does not show distinct changes with the use of DIO/CN additives. The relevant TA spectra of the neat IT-4F films are given in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Thereafter, the PBDB-TF exciton signals are fitted using a three exponential decay function, ΔOD(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + A3exp(−t/τ3) + γ0, and the fitting parameters are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† It is common for polymers to be fitted to multiple decay components, since the disorder gives rise to multiple populations of conjugated polymers.9 We note that the intrinsic recombination of excitons in pristine PBDB-TF film is much faster than that in DIO/CN additive-processed films. The average lifetimes of the excitons are 12, 154 and 130 ps for the pristine, and DIO- and CN-processed PBDB-TF films, respectively. Short-lived excitons would be more likely to recombine prior to dissociating at the donor/acceptor interfaces leading to additional losses during charge generation processes in pristine blend films. The exciton kinetics of PBDB-TF films processed with DIO/CN additives are quite similar. The long-lived species are formed in the additive-processed neat PBDB-TF films, which is mainly attributed to the more ordered nature of the films, as verified by the GIWAXS data.

Fig. 5(a)–(c) shows the selected TA spectra of the PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1) blend films prepared without or with additives. Three distinct regions can be observed: a negative GSB signal at 510–667 nm, an overlapped region of GSB, SE and PIA at 667–780 nm and a positive PIA signal from 820 nm to 1400 nm. Although the TA features of the blend films are broad, the central positions of different species can be assigned by scrutinizing the TA spectral evolution with delay time and comparing with the TA spectra of the neat PBDB-TF and IT-4F films. The PBDB-TF-dominated GSB kinetics (at 580 nm) shown in Fig. 5(d)–(f) appears instantaneously within the instrument response time followed by a second rise, indicating that the delayed charge generation resulted from the hole transfer from IT-4F to PBDB-TF in the blend films. In the overlapped spectral region, the TA spectra of DIO-processed blend film show a strong GSB at 750 nm dominated by IT-4F according to the TA spectra of the neat IT-4F film in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The PIA peak centered at 965 nm can be mainly ascribed to IT-4F, while the peaks centered at 1170 arising within the instrumental response time and 1250 nm emerging after the initial stage (≈10 ps) can be assigned to PBDB-TF. Obviously, the exciton signals are still visible in the 820–1400 nm region at early times and they are more pronounced in DIO-processed blend film. The exciton signal decays faster in the blend films than in the neat PBDB-TF film, indicating that some population of excitons has been quickly quenched by charge transfer. Since the PIA signals of excitons and charged species are overlapped, the TA signal arising at a longer time represents the feature of charged species. As shown in Fig. 5(g)–(i), the pristine and CN-processed blend films demonstrate similar GSB kinetics and PIA kinetics, while in the case of DIO-processed blend film, both GSB and PIA signals decay faster in comparison to the pristine and CN-processed blend films, which can be correlated to the coexistence of the edge-on and face-on arrangement of the PBDB-TF domains in the blend film. An additional slow but significant rise of PIA signal assigned to PBDB-TF is observed in the blend films, as shown in Fig. 5(i). The charged species of PBDB-TF have a broad PIA and an additional rise detected in the near-infrared (NIR) range of 1100–1400 nm. Such a rise of the PIA has previously been assigned to hole transfer,30,51 exciton diffusion,52 the formation of triplet excitons49 or an increased absorptivity of charges in other blend films when they are loosely bound.6,53–55 In our experiments, no clear evidence was observed that the PIA rise is resulting from the increased absorptivity of loosely bound charge carrier pairs. Exciton diffusion and subsequent dissociation at the D/A interfaces may be one of the origins for such a PIA signal rise. However, diffusion-limited exciton dissociation contributes little to the signal rise since the excitons are absent at that timescale. Hence, the most likely explanation for the PIA rise may be the hole transfer or/and the generation of triplet excitons. However, as shown in Fig. 5(g), the signal rise of the polymer bleach due to the hole transfer can be seen only during the first 30 ps. The additional PIA rise of the blend films would be likely caused by the other physical processes, for instance, the formation of the polymer triplet excitons in a subnanosecond scale.

In order to verify this speculation, the TA characteristics of the pristine PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend films exposed to an ambient atmosphere were also measured for comparison. As shown in Fig. 6(a), all of the TA signals, especially the GSB dominated by PBDB-TF, decay more rapidly in an ambient atmosphere, which proves that this spectral feature of the second rise of the PIA kinetics corresponds to the formation of polymer triplet species,49,56,57 although we note that a small amount of residual rise signal is present, which could also consist of PBDB-TF charged species due to spectral overlap. The formation of the triplet species via intersystem crossing from S1 to T1 can be ruled out since it is absent in the triplet feature of the neat films. The PBDB-TF triplet formation is likely to arise from a recombination process of charged species on a sub-nanosecond timescale.58–60 The intensity-dependent kinetics for the pristine PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend film is shown in Fig. 6(b), where a higher proportion of triplets are generated with higher pump intensity. It is therefore rational to assign this process to a second-order process caused by bimolecular recombination of charged species rather than a first-order process. It is noted that the intensity of the initial PIA signal scales linearly with the pump intensity, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), indicating that the measurements are not affected by higher-order annihilation processes. A similar phenomenon was also observed in fullerene-based blend films.49 As presented in Fig. 5(i), the TA results suggest that the triplet formation is effectively suppressed in DIO-processed PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend film. The PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend film was also pumped at 750 nm to selectively excite the acceptor to populate the polymer charged species via hole transfer from acceptor to donor. The TA spectra are presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†) and the GSB kinetics at 580 nm are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). It can be seen that the timescale of hole transfer in the three PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend films is several tens of picoseconds, which is identical to the results obtained with a pumping wavelength at 500 nm. More importantly, as shown in Fig. 7, for the PIA kinetics of the PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1) blend films at 1250 nm, the second rise of PIA signals for PBDB-TF triplet excitons is more pronounced and the trend for different blend films agrees well with those under 500 nm excitation shown in Fig. 5(i). Since IT-4F is selectively excited in the blend films, it is evident that the formation of polymer triplet excitons originates from the recombination of charged species. The second rise of the PIA of polymer triplet excitons in DIO-processed blend film reaches its maximum at about 200 ps, while these signals do not reach their maximum until 500 ps in the pristine and CN-processed films, indicating that the formation of triplet exciton is effectively suppressed in the DIO-processed blend film compared to the pristine and CN-processed blend films. As discussed above, it is clear that the TA spectra of the blend films are influenced by the blend film morphologies. The coexistence of both edge-on and face-on orientations of PBDB-TF domains, such as in the DIO-processed blend film, is favorable to suppress charge recombination via weakening the formation of triplet excitons on PBDB-TF.

PSCs based on the different PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend layers were fabricated to explore the correlation between the photophysical process and photovoltaic performance of PSCs. The PBDB-TF:IT-4F active layer was spin-coated from CB, CB:0.5% DIO and CB:1% CN solutions, respectively. The concentration of 1% CN is optimal according to the photovoltaic characteristics of the devices processed with various contents of CN (Fig. S7, ESI†). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the corresponding PSCs are shown in Fig. 8(a) and the relevant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S2 in the ESI.† More than 10 devices for each type were fabricated. These devices show good reproducibility and their average parameters are also summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The device based on the pristine PBDB-TF:IT-4F layer produces a low JSC of 17.60 mA cm−2. The higher JSCs of 19.91 mA cm−2 and 20.07 mA cm−2 are achieved in DIO- and CN-processed PSCs, respectively. Dark J–V characteristics (Fig. S8, ESI†) of the DIO and CN-processed devices show low leakage current compared with the control device based on the pristine blend film. Especially, the DIO-processed device presents the highest rectification ratio among the three devices. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) data are shown in Fig. 8(b). When a small amount of DIO and CN additives was used, the EQE spectra of the resultant devices increased with a maximum EQE of about 80% at 570 nm. The integrated JSC values from the EQE curves are 17.68, 19.25 and 19.24 mA cm−2 for the pristine, and DIO- and CN-processed devices, respectively. The results agree well with the JSC values obtained from the J–V measurements with deviations below 5%. The JSCs are consistent with the TA findings of increased initial exciton densities in both DIO- and CN-processed PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend films. The DIO-processed device exhibits an outstanding FF of 76.2%, while the FFs of the pristine and CN-processed devices are 71.4% and 72.0%, respectively. The FF is one of the important parameters for solar cells that could reflect the status of charge recombination in the blend films.61–63 The higher FF means that the charge recombination under the weak internal electric field is effectively suppressed in the DIO-processed device. Under the large internal electric field, the photogenerated charges can be quickly swept out of the devices without recombination for all the three kinds of devices. However, under a weak internal electric field (large positive bias), the charges may undergo recombination via the formation of triplet excitons leading to a decreased FF in the pristine and CN-processed devices. In the DIO-processed PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend PSCs, this kind of recombination can be effectively suppressed as discussed above. With a small amount of DIO additive, the JSC and FF of the resultant PSCs increased by about 13% and 7% compared to the control PSC based on the pristine PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend film, respectively. However, the VOC of the DIO-processed device is a little lower than those of the pristine and CN-processed devices. A similar phenomenon of a decreased VOC upon the use of DIO additive has been reported previously by Jain, et al.64 They found that the use of DIO can improve the bulk properties, such as crystallinity and domain purity of the active layer, but it increases the energetic disorder at the donor/acceptor interface with an increased interfacial Urbach energy, resulting in a decreased VOC. The molecular packing orientation has also been proved to affect the CT state energy.65 It is reported that edge-on and face-on orientations correspond to CT state energies of 1.86 and 1.74 eV for the rubrene:C60 blends, respectively. Herein, the enhanced PBDB-TF face-on orientation in DIO-processed PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend film may be the origin of its lower VOC than that of the CN-processed device. The charge carrier mobilities of the PBDB-TF:IT-4F blends processed with different conditions were also measured by using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method. The electron and hole mobilities (μe and μh) were extracted from the slopes of J0.5–V curves by modeling the current in the SCLC region (Fig. S9, ESI†) and the results are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). For the pristine device, the μe and μh are 0.47 × 10−4 and 2.00 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The μe and μh values are estimated to be 1.42 × 10−4/3.30 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.01 × 10−4/3.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the blends processed with DIO and CN, respectively. After using the additives, both the μe and μh are increased and the charge transport balance is also improved.

3. Conclusions
In summary, the influence of solvent additives on the charge generation and recombination dynamics in the high-performing PBDB-TF:IT-4F blends has been investigated by ultrafast spectroscopic techniques. Both DIO and CN additives can increase the average lifetimes and densities of excitons in neat PBDB-TF films. This means that the DIO and CN additives may improve the generation and dissociation of excitons in the corresponding PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend films and thus lead to a large photocurrent in PSCs. It is also found that the DIO-processed blend film can suppress the formation of polymer triplet excitons, which is one pathway of charge recombination losses. This phenomenon is correlated to the coexistence of edge-on and face-on orientation of PBDB-TF domains in the DIO-processed blend film. The work provides a comprehensive insight into the ultrafast photophysical processes occurring in varied blend morphologies induced by additives and their effect on the photovoltaic parameters of the devices.
4. Experimental section
Materials
Polymer donor PBDB-TF and non-fullerene acceptor IT-4F purchased from Solarmer Co. were used as received.
Thin film characterization
The UV-vis absorption and PL spectra were collected on an Agilent Cary 60UV-Vis spectrophotometer and a PerkinElmer LS55 spectrofluorometer, respectively. The GIWAXS experiments were carried out at the BL1W1A beamline of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (λ = 1.54 Å). Femtosecond transient visible and NIR absorption spectroscopies were carried out by using an Astrella (Coherent Corporation, USA) Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (1 kHz repetition rate, and 800 nm laser pulse with 100 fs pulse width). The output of the amplifier was split with one beam used to generate the pump pulse with a TOPAS-Prime (Light Conversion) optical parametric amplifier and the second to generate a white light probe using either a sapphire crystal for the visible range or a proprietary crystal for the NIR spectral region (Helios fire, Ultrafast Systems, USA). The spectra and decays were detected by a Helios fire TA spectrometer (800–1600 nm) with a 6 ns delay stage. TA measurements were performed using low excitation fluences of 1.9 μJ cm−2 at 500 nm and 1.2 μJ cm−2 at 750 nm to avoid nonlinear photophysics.
Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
The PSCs were fabricated with the inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-TF:IT-4F/MoO3/Al. The ITO glass substrates were cleaned with a routine procedure, which was followed by UV-ozone treatment for 25 min before use. Approximately 30 nm-thick ZnO film was deposited atop the ITO by spin-coating a ZnO precursor solution. The ZnO precursor was prepared according to the reported procedure.66 The PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1 in weight) CB solution, with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1, was spun cast on the ZnO layer and the samples were annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. The samples were then transferred in a vacuum chamber and the layers of 10 nm MoO3 and 100 nm Al were thermally deposited. The active area of the PSC devices is about 8 mm2. The J–V characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit and a Class AAA XES-50S2 solar simulator (SAN-EI Electric Co., Ltd) under AM 1.5G illumination at a calibrated light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 inside a glove box. The EQE curves were obtained in air by using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R 3011 (Enli Technology Co., Ltd).
