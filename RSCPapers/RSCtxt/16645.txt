ChinaReceived 19th June 2013, Accepted 20th August 2013First published on 27th August 2013AbstractFor colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), shape control and doping as two widely applied strategies are crucial for enhancing and manipulating their functional properties. Here we report a facile and green synthetic approach for high-quality colloidal Mn doped ZnO NCs with simultaneous control over composition, shape and optical properties. Specifically, the shape of doped ZnO NCs can be finely modulated from three dimensional (3D) tetrapods to 0D spherical nanoparticles in a single reaction scheme. The growth mechanism of doped ZnO NCs with interesting shape transition is explored. Furthermore, we demonstrate the tunable optical absorption features of Mn doped ZnO NCs by varying the Mn doping levels, and the enhanced photocatalytic performance of Mn doped ZnO NCs under visible light, which can be further optimized by delicately controlling their shapes and Mn doping concentrations. Our results provide an improved understanding of the growth mechanism of doped NCs during the growth process and can be potentially extended to ZnO NCs doped with other metal ions for various applications.IntroductionColloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) represent an important class of functional materials with unique size- and shape-dependent optical, electronic, magnetic and catalytic properties. In the past decade, these versatile materials have attracted increasing attention, owing to their appealing tunable physical properties, excellent solution-processability and a wide range of potential applications emerging in areas of solar energy conversion,1–3 photocatalytic systems,4–6 light-emitting devices,7,8 photodetectors9 and bio-imaging.10–12 To date, a variety of solution-phase synthetic approaches, including use of appropriate surfactants,13–15 seed-mediated growth,16,17 oriented attachment18–20 and ion exchange reactions,21–23 have been developed to achieve colloidal semiconductor NCs with controlled size and many different shapes, such as zero dimensional (0D) dots,24,25 1D rods,26,27 2D platelets,28–30 and 3D tetrapods.31–33Doping that involves the intentional incorporation of suitable impurities (cations or anions) into the host lattices is fundamentally crucial for semiconductors, which provides another effective approach by tuning the composition to enhance the properties of semiconductor NCs for targeted functions.34,35 For instance, high-quality ZnSe NCs doped with cation transition metals Mn2+ or Cu2+ exclusively exhibited a tunable dopant emission as alternative light emitters to CdSe NCs;36,37 while the introduction of transition metals Mn2+ or Co2+ into ZnO NCs, often known as diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS), might result in the interesting magnetic and magneto-optical properties and holds great promise in spintronics.38,39 In another study, Asahi and co-workers suggested that the substitutional anion-doping of N in TiO2 powder could lead to an enhanced optical absorption and improved photocatalytic activity under visible light.40 Recent developments on doping of colloidal NCs showed that the crystallographic phase, size, shape and optical emission properties of upconversion NCs could be rationally tuned through the lanthanide doping.41–43 More recently, Pradhan et al. reported a dopant-induced reversible phase transition of ZnS nanoplatelets between wurtzite (WZ) and zincblende (ZB) phases in a colloidal solution through the insertion/ejection of Mn2+ ions.44 These findings demonstrated that in colloidal NCs where the crystal growth was normally confined in a limited size regime, doping was much more complex than that in bulk semiconductors, and the growth process of doped NCs and the resulting properties could be strongly influenced by doping.It should be pointed out that the concepts of doping used for colloidal NCs and bulk semiconductors are somewhat different. In bulk semiconductors, doping means introduction of trace amounts of dopants into intrinsic semiconductors to change their electrical properties and when doping concentration is on the order of one per ten thousand atoms, the doping is called heavy doping. However, in colloidal NCs doping simply refers to the incorporation of dopants into the host lattices and the doping concentration can be a few percent, or even over ten percent, in which case alloyed NCs are actually formed.41,43 In the present work, the concept of doping used for colloidal NCs is adopted.Despite the remarkable advances of synthetic chemistry on colloidal NCs in recent years,45,46 the knowledge on the growth mechanism of doped NCs is still limited. On the basis of theoretical calculations, Norris et al. proposed a trapped dopant model for Mn doped II–VI semiconductor NCs, in which doping was controlled by the impurity adsorption on the NC surface and the Mn doping efficiency in ZnSe NCs varied with the size and shape.34,35 Cao et al. further suggested that the Mn doping in CdS/ZnS core/shell NCs was mainly determined by three processes: dopant adsorption, dopant replacement and host-lattice growth.47 The authors also found that Mn doping efficiency was ultimately independent on the size, shape and crystal structure of doped NCs, quite different from Norris' model. More recently, Peng and co-workers demonstrated that there were at least four temperature-dependent processes involved in doping NCs, and they observed that the Mn dopant ions could be completely eliminated from the doped ZnSe NCs through “lattice diffusion” and “lattice ejection” at ca. 300 °C.48 Although enormous efforts have been made by the researchers, achieving well-defined size and shape control of colloidal doped NCs still remains a great challenge, and the underlying reaction mechanism during the growth of doped NCs is not fully understood.As one of the well-known oxide semiconductors, ZnO NCs have been extensively studied as excellent host materials for doping due to their fundamental importance and technological applications in many areas.49,50 Our previous studies on doped ZnO NCs showed that effective Mg doping could modify the initial growth seeds and significantly influence the phase, shape and optical properties of doped ZnO NCs.51 Hence it is reasonable that doping ZnO NCs with other chosen metal ions, such as transition metals, may lead to the emergence of new targeted material properties, and further insight into the growth mechanism of doped NCs can be gained by exploring the interactions between dopant ions and growth kinetics during the growth process. To the best of our knowledge, colloidal transition metal Mn2+ ion doped ZnO NCs with tailored compositions and shapes have been rarely addressed in the literature, and these novel materials may have great potential as low cost, nontoxic and efficient visible light photocatalysts toward solving the global energy and environment problems.52Herein, we report a facile and green synthetic approach for colloidal Mn doped ZnO NCs with well-defined compositions and shapes. By careful manipulation of the reaction kinetics, the shape of Mn doped ZnO NCs could be finely modulated, from 3D tetrapods to 0D spherical nanoparticles (NPs), in a single reaction system without the use of any foreign surfactants. With a combination of advanced characterization techniques, the growth mechanism of doped NCs with interesting shape transition was explored. In addition, we demonstrated the enhanced visible light photocatalytic performance of the Mn doped ZnO NCs by degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) solutions, and further investigated the impact of shapes and Mn doping concentrations of doped ZnO NCs on the resulting photocatalytic activities under visible light.Experimental sectionMaterialsZinc stearate (Zn(St)2), 1-octadecanol (ODA, 97%), manganese(II) chloride (MnCl2) and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH, 98%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. 1-Octadecene (ODE, tech 90%) and cadmium acetate (Cd(Ac)2) were purchased from Acros Organics. Stearic acid (HSt, 95%) was purchased from Aldrich. Rhodamine B (RhB, 96%) was purchased from J&K Chemicals. All the organic solvents were of analytical grade from Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagents. All chemicals were used directly without further purification.Preparation of manganese stearate (Mn(St)2)The Mn precursor, manganese stearate (Mn(St)2), was prepared according to the method reported by Peng et al.53 Briefly, 20 mmol of HSt was dissolved in 30 g of methanol under slight heating (ca. 50 °C), forming a clear solution. A TMAH solution containing 20 mmol of TMAH in 10 g of methanol was then neutralized with the above HSt solution under stirring for 30 min. Into this solution, 10 mmol of MnCl2 dissolved in 10 g of methanol was added dropwise under vigorous stirring, resulting in the precipitation of white Mn(St)2 from the solution. The obtained Mn(St)2 was washed repeatedly with warm methanol and acetone alternately to eliminate the possible residual MnCl2, TMAH or HSt from the solid. The final product was dried at 80 °C under vacuum overnight and then ground into fine powder before use.Synthesis of Mn doped ZnO tetrapods (TPs)Mn doped ZnO tetrapods were synthesized using a procedure modified from our earlier publication. Briefly, designated amounts of Zn(St)2 and Mn(St)2, with a total amount of 1 mmol, were loaded into a 100 mL three-necked flask with 20 g of ODE, and then heated to ca. 290 °C under an argon atmosphere to form a clear and colorless solution. Into this solution was rapidly injected a separate solution of ODE (5 g) containing 5 mmol of ODA at 200 °C. After the injection, the color of the reaction solution turned yellowish and then to orange in ca. 2 min, indicating the formation of Mn doped ZnO nanocrystal seeds. To obtain high-quality Mn doped ZnO tetrapods, the reaction was typically kept at ca. 290 °C for 8 min and then cooled to room temperature.Synthesis of Mn doped ZnO spherical nanoparticles (NPs)In our reaction system, high-quality Mn doped ZnO spherical NPs could be obtained by extending the reaction for Mn doped ZnO tetrapods to ca. 1 h at 290 °C. The resulting NCs were precipitated by addition of excess ethyl acetate and then washed repeatedly with a standard procedure, and finally dissolved in chloroform or toluene for further characterization.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)Survey TEM was conducted using a Philips CM 200 microscope operated at 160 kV and a JEOL JEM 1230 microscope operated at 80 kV. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern was taken on a Philips CM 200 microscope with a camera length of 20 cm. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were performed on FEI TECNAI G2 F20 and JEOL JEM 2100F microscopes operated at 200 kV. TEM samples were prepared by dropping a dilute solution of NCs onto carbon-coated copper grids and then dried in air.Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on a PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 40 mA using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The crystallographic information was collected with a step size of 0.016° in the 2θ range from 25 to 80°. Samples for XRD analyses were prepared by depositing concentrated solutions of purified NCs onto glass substrates.Optical measurementsThe UV-vis absorption experiments were carried out on a Shimadzu UV 3600 spectrophotometer equipped with deuterium and tungsten–halogen lamps. The photoluminescence (PL) measurement was conducted on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS-920 spectrophotometer with a xenon lamp excited at 300 nm. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on Thermo Nicolet 380 and Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometers after 32 scans with a resolution of 4 cm−1 in the range of 400 to 4000 cm−1. The specimens for FTIR measurements were prepared by directly spotting hot aliquots from the reaction solution which were sampled at different reaction times onto KBr crystal plates.X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES)The X-ray absorption experiments were performed on beamline U7C at the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL), China. The Mn K-edge XANES spectra were collected in a fluorescence yield mode in air at room temperature by using a Si (111) double crystal monochromator. The XANES data were normalized and processed using the program Athena.54 In our experiments, Mn, MnO, MnO2, Mn3O4 and Mn(St)2 were chosen as bulk references.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurementsThe EPR experiments were performed at X-band frequency (9.5 GHz) on a Bruker A-300 spectrometer. The EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature (300 K) and 100 K, respectively. The samples for EPR measurements were thoroughly washed and equal amounts of purified NC powders were loaded into the EPR quartz tubes for test. The obtained spectra were processed by using Bruker WinEPR software.Inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectroscopy (ICP-AAS)ICP-AAS measurements were conducted with a Thermo Electron SOLAAR M6 atomic absorption spectrometer. The samples for ICP-AAS were prepared by digesting the purified NCs with concentrated nitric acid (63%) for the elemental analyses of Zn and Mn.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)XPS investigation was conducted on a Thermo ESCALAB-250 spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation source (1486.6 eV) with a power of 150 W. The photoelectrons were collected with a pass energy of 20 eV for the core level scans. Samples for XPS were prepared by depositing purified NC solutions onto silicon slides. The XPS binding energies were calibrated by referring the C 1s peak to 284.6 eV, which originated from the surface contaminated carbons.Photocatalytic activity measurementsThe photocatalytic activity of the materials was evaluated by investigating the visible light photocatalytic degradation of RhB in aqueous solution in a cylindrical quartz photoreactor. The visible light was obtained via a 300 W xenon lamp with a cut-off filter of 420 nm, while the temperature of the reaction solution was maintained at room temperature by circulating with cool water. Considering that pH may have a great influence on the performance of photocatalysts, the pH value of RhB solution with 1 μmol RhB in 100 mL deionized water was measured to be ca. 5.7 and all the photocatalytic experiments were carried out at this pH value. Typically, 40 mg of each sample was dispersed in 100 mL of deionized water and then ultrasonicated for ca. 1 h. To this solution, 1 mL of 1 mM RhB aqueous solution was added. Before illumination, the above suspension was stirred continuously in the dark for 30 min to reach an adsorption–desorption equilibrium of dye molecules on the surface of photocatalysts. At regular time intervals, ca. 2 mL of aliquots were sampled during irradiation and centrifuged to remove the photocatalyst powders. The concentration of the remaining dyes was monitored by measuring the absorbance of the solution at the maximum in the UV-vis spectrum.Results and discussionIn the present work, high-quality Mn doped ZnO NCs were grown by employing a simple, green and reproducible synthetic route that involved alcoholysis of mixed metal precursors in a non-coordinating solvent at elevated temperatures. For the successful incorporation of dopants into host lattices, one of the key steps is to choose appropriate dopant and host precursors with balanced reactivity.55 Compared with Zn2+, Mn2+ is a relatively hard Lewis acid, and thus the Mn precursor with the same carboxylate ligand as Zn2+ is somewhat less reactive, suggesting that Mn(St)2 may be a suitable Mn precursor for doping ZnO NCs in our case.36 In this text, the reactions and products are named after the nominal concentration of the Mn precursor in the reagents. For example, 10% Mn reaction represents the reaction starting with 0.1 mmol of Mn(St)2 and 0.9 mmol of Zn(St)2.Fig. 1A shows a typical low-magnification TEM image of the 10% Mn doped ZnO tetrapods as an illustrative example, suggesting that the growth of high-quality Mn doped ZnO tetrapods with high yields (see Fig. S1†) can be simply achieved by introducing suitable amounts of the Mn dopant precursor, Mn(St)2 in this work, into the ZnO NC reaction system developed by Peng and co-workers.56 Statistical analysis on quantities of Mn doped ZnO tetrapods revealed that the branching arms of the tetrapods had relatively uniform diameters of ca. 4.8 nm with lengths in the range of 11–13 nm. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) studies of these individual tetrapods indicated that the branching arms were highly crystalline with hexagonal WZ structure and grown along their [0001] directions, as seen in Fig. 1B and S2.† Although there have been several reports on tetrapods with various materials grown in the solution-phase over the past decade,15,57,58 direct observation of the central regions with atomic resolution in nanoscale domains still remains challenging, mainly due to the presence of the standing arms pointing upward, which hinder most central regions of the tetrapods. One possible way to overcome this problem is to image bipods or tripods, which are tetrapods with several arms missing. A combination of detailed HRTEM investigations and atomic simulation (Fig. 1C and D and S3†) demonstrated that the Mn doped ZnO tetrapod consisted of a cubic ZB core and hexagonal WZ arms, matching well with a polymorphism model.31 As a consequence, the branching of tetrapods was realized through the growth of WZ arms along their [0001] directions from the atomically identical {111} facets of the ZB core. This fact was also supported by studies on the initial growth seeds of tetrapods, as shown in Fig. S4.† At the primary growth stage of 2–3 min, the Mn dopants were already incorporated into the initial seeds with a concentration of ca. 6 at.%, giving rise to the nucleation of a ZB core followed by the growth of multiple WZ arms, similar to the case of Mg doped ZnO tetrapods.51 Further HRTEM analyses revealed the presence of stacking faults (SFs) distributed along the long axis of the arms at the arm/core interfaces in all investigated samples (as seen in Fig. 1C, S4D and S5†). The occurrence of stacking faults, typically with one or two layer interruption in the stacking sequence, was found to be intimately associated with the large lattice strain within doped NCs arising from the size mismatch between the dopant and host cations.59 It should be mentioned that when no Mn dopants were introduced into the precursors, no undoped ZnO tetrapods but only faceted ZnO NPs with the WZ phase were obtained regardless of the reaction time under similar reaction conditions (see Fig. S6†). In the present work, tetrapods are only formed by introducing suitable Mn, Cd or Mg dopant precursors into the starting materials, as reported in our previous study.51 The Mn dopants can be well incorporated into the ZnO host lattices at the primary growth stage, modify the crystalline structure and finally lead to the formation of tetrapods.

(B) HRTEM image of a single tetrapod with one branching arm pointing upward, indicating the hexagonal WZ structure of the arm. (C) HRTEM image of the central region of a bipod and (D) the corresponding 2D atomic simulation, respectively, clearly showing the presence of stacking faults (SFs) commonly observed at the ZB core/WZ arm interfaces, as indicated by the arrows. In the present work, it is of particular interest to observe the shape transition of Mn doped ZnO NCs from 3D tetrapods to 0D spherical NPs, by extending the reaction time at elevated temperatures. Fig. 2A shows the typical low-magnification TEM image of the approximately spherical 10% Mn doped ZnO NPs with diameters of ca. 8 nm. HRTEM analyses and atomic simulation of the NPs (Fig. 2B–D and S7†) demonstrated the single-crystalline nature of the resulting Mn doped ZnO NPs with a pure hexagonal WZ phase, in accordance with the SAED pattern of the NPs as shown in Fig. S8.† Fig. 2  (A) Typical TEM image of Mn doped ZnO spherical NPs from the 10% Mn reaction, highlighting their size and shape monodispersity.

(D) Three-dimensional (3D) rendering of an atomic model of Mn doped ZnO spherical NPs with the WZ structure (not in scale). To further investigate the phase purity and crystal structure of Mn doped ZnO NCs, the tetrapods and spherical NPs from the 10% Mn reactions were probed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 3A, all the diffraction peaks of the doped ZnO NCs could be readily indexed to the hexagonal WZ structure of ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451). It is worth noting that the ZB phase of the core in tetrapods cannot be distinguished from the highly broadened reflection lines by XRD, most likely due to the fact that the ZB core domains are in a very small minority within tetrapods and are usually hidden by multiple branching arms with strong reflections. Furthermore, the diffraction peaks of Mn doped ZnO NCs were shifted slightly toward the lower 2θ side as compared with pure ZnO, indicating the increased lattice constants of doped NCs. The lattice expansion upon Mn doping in this work was due to the substitution of Zn2+ (ionic radius, 0.74 Å) sites by larger Mn2+ (ionic radius, 0.80 Å) in the host lattices. In each case, the significant broadening of diffraction peaks was arising from the much limited crystallite sizes at the nanoscale, which was in line with the results by TEM measurements. Fig. 3  (A) Powder XRD patterns of Mn doped ZnO tetrapods and NPs from the 10% Mn reactions. The diffraction peaks of bulk WZ ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451) and pure ZnO NPs synthesized under similar reaction conditions are included for comparison. (B) UV-vis absorption spectra of Mn doped ZnO tetrapods and NPs from the 10% Mn reactions, exhibiting the emergence of an absorption band toward the visible region and a slight blue-shift of the absorption edge in comparison with that of pure ZnO NPs. (C) Mn K-edge XANES spectra of Mn doped ZnO tetrapods and NPs from the 10% Mn reactions. All spectra are normalized and shifted for clarity. The optical properties of ZnO NCs are greatly influenced by the Mn incorporation. Fig. 3B shows the typical UV-vis absorption spectra of 10% Mn doped ZnO tetrapods and spherical NPs. A slight blue-shift of the absorption edge was identified in all the Mn doped ZnO NCs with respect to that of pure ZnO. Such a blue-shift of the optical band gap, determined from the Tauc plots as shown in Fig. S9,† was mainly due to the energy band reconstruction of ZnO NCs via Mn doping. In addition, doping transition metal Mn2+ ions into ZnO NCs could also facilitate the extension of the optical absorption toward the visible light region. Consequently, we observed an apparent broad band in the range of 380–500 nm from the 10% Mn doped ZnO NCs, similar to previous reports by several groups.50,60,61 A series of experiments were performed to verify whether this broad band was originating from the absorption of MnO or scattering. The UV-vis spectra of MnO NPs and the mixture of MnO and ZnO NPs exhibited no obvious visible light absorption (see Fig. S10†), consistent with the wide band gap of MnO (ca. 4.2 eV), indicating that this broad band was not arising from MnO. In this work, all the solutions of Mn doped ZnO NCs are transparent and clear, and can be readily filtered by 0.22 μm PTFE filters with no obvious changes in UV-vis spectra, excluding the presence of any aggregations, as shown in Fig. S11† by taking the 10% Mn doped ZnO NCs as a good example. In addition, the particle sizes of the Mn doped ZnO NCs are significantly small with respect to the wavelengths of light under UV-vis (280–600 nm). Therefore Rayleigh scattering will be theoretically applied for the solutions of Mn doped ZnO NCs and the intensity of the scattered light I should vary as the sixth power of the particle size d, and vary inversely with the fourth power of the wavelength λ (I ∝ d6/λ4).62 For a specific sample, the particle size is fixed, and we can obtain I ∝ 1/λ4, which is quite different from our experimental findings in Fig. 3B. We demonstrated that the broad visible band in Mn doped ZnO NCs was not caused by scattering. As we know, there are generally three types of electronic transitions associated with transition metal doped ZnO: (1) dopant d–d internal transition, (2) charge transfer transition either from the dopant d-state to the host conduction band (CB) or from the host valence band (VB) to the dopant d-state, and (3) band-to-band transition from the VB to CB in the host.63 For Mn doped ZnO, the absorption band in the visible light region is still controversial.64 Based on the results and reported studies,65–67 we suggested that in the present work the origin of this broad visible band in Mn doped ZnO NCs was ascribed to the charge transfer between Mn dopants and VB as well as d–d transition in the crystal field, similar to reported work for Co2+ doped ZnO NCs.67 It is worth noting that no significant photoluminescence (PL) emission was detected at room temperature from these Mn doped ZnO NCs. The recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes was greatly inhibited through the incorporation of Mn dopants, indicating the presence of a large number of carrier traps within these nanostructures.X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) at the Mn K-edge was conducted to elucidate the oxidation state and the local environment of Mn dopants within doped ZnO NCs, providing more direct information for Mn dopants. Fig. 3C reports the Mn K-edge XANES spectra for the 10% Mn doped ZnO tetrapods and NPs. Bulk metallic Mn, Mn(St)2 and various manganese oxides are also included as references. From Fig. 3C, one can see that the spectra of Mn doped ZnO NCs have a similar absorption edge with those of MnO and Mn(St)2, but are quite different from those of metallic Mn, MnO2 and Mn3O4. This fact implies that the incorporated Mn species preserved the bivalent oxidation state. In addition, the appearance of a pronounced pre-edge peak at ca. 6537 eV and a pre-edge shoulder at ca. 6543 eV, as evidenced from the XANES features, demonstrated that the Mn dopants were in a tetrahedral configuration of ZnO with a lattice-substitution mode, excluding the presence of MnO or Mn(St)2 as any secondary phases.68 On the basis of the above results, we can conclude that the Mn dopants have been well incorporated into the host lattices on Zn2+ sites (as seen in Fig. S12†), and the alloyed NCs of Mn, Zn and O are actually formed with no separation of Mn or manganese oxide related clusters within Mn doped ZnO NCs.Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was further employed to probe the distribution of Mn dopants in doped ZnO NCs. Before EPR measurements, Mn doped ZnO NCs were thoroughly washed to remove the surface adsorbed Mn2+ ions. The EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature (300 K) and 100 K, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4 and S13.† The EPR intensity by integration of the spectrum is found to typically increase with decreased temperature or increased Mn doping concentrations (Fig. 4). In each case, we find that only a broad signal appears most of the time, probably due to concentrated Mn2+ ions with enhanced dipolar interactions, which is frequently observed in Mn doped II–VI NCs.69 From these spectra, we can obtain the g factor in the Zeeman interaction term to be ca. 2.009 in all cases. This value is larger than that of Mn2+ ions on the surface of doped ZnO NCs (g = 1.978), and agrees well with that reported for Mn2+ ions located on substitutional Zn2+ sites in ZnO NCs (g = 2.002),70 demonstrating the incorporation of Mn2+ ions on Zn2+ lattice sites in the interior of doped NCs, consistent with the XANES result. In addition, the presence of Mn in doped ZnO NCs was also established by detailed elemental analyses by EDX and XPS on selected samples, as shown in Fig. S14 and S15.† Although we have observed a quite unresolved six-line structure from the sample of 5% Mn doped ZnO NPs at 100 K (Fig. 4A), it is rather difficult to get more reliable information such as the hyperfine splitting constant for the Mn2+ ions by EPR due to the high local Mn concentrations. Thus in the future work, we will try to directly detect and characterize the dopants within doped ZnO NCs to reveal their distribution in tetrapods and NPs by using advanced annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM). Fig. 4  (A) EPR spectra of 5% Mn doped ZnO NPs at 100 K and 300 K and (B) EPR spectra of 5% and 10% Mn doped ZnO tetrapods at 100 K. Controlled synthesis of Mn doped ZnO NCs with tailored compositions and shapes, from high-quality tetrapods to spherical NPs, has been readily achieved by finely tuning the reaction kinetics of the synthetic scheme (as seen in Fig. S16 and S17†). By employing Mn(St)2 as the Mn precursor, the final Mn doping concentrations of doped ZnO NCs could be tuned in a wide range by varying the molar ratio of the Mn precursor in the starting materials, as determined by the ICP-AAS measurements (see Fig. 5 and Table S1 in the ESI†). From the view point of controlled synthesis of doped NCs, we mainly focused on doped ZnO NCs with Mn precursor concentrations in the range of 5–20 mol% in this work. When doping ZnO NCs, a color transition from white of pure ZnO to yellowish and then brown of Mn doped ZnO NCs occurred with increasing Mn doping levels (as seen in Fig. S18†). The absorption spectra of Mn doped ZnO NCs, either in the shape of tetrapods or spherical NPs, exhibited an enhanced and tunable optical response in the visible light region as the Mn doping concentrations increased (see Fig. 5A and B), which was desirable for efficient visible light photocatalysis. It should be mentioned that the synthetic reaction for high-quality Mn doped ZnO tetrapods might become less controllable and more nanorods would appear in the products apart from tetrapods, specifically when the amount of Mn(St)2 in precursors increased to ca. 50 mol% (Fig. S17E†), revealing that the synthetic reaction for the formation of doped ZnO NCs was strongly influenced by the Mn doping. As observed from Fig. S19,† the lattices of doped ZnO NCs expanded continuously with increasing Mn incorporation, which was consistent with the substitution of larger Mn2+ ions on Zn2+ sites, reflecting a substantial increase of the lattice strain within doped ZnO NCs at elevated Mn doping levels.71 Fig. 5  (A and B) UV-vis spectra of Mn doped ZnO tetrapods and spherical NPs with different Mn precursor concentrations as indicated in the plots, respectively. The absorption spectra of pure ZnO NPs are also added for comparison. (C) Mn doping concentrations in the resulting doped NCs with different shapes as a function of the Mn precursor concentrations in the reagents. Further experiments were conducted to elucidate the growth mechanism of Mn doped ZnO NCs with interesting shape transition from tetrapods to spherical NPs. In this regard, the 10% Mn reaction was taken as an example and the entire growth process was closely monitored by extracting aliquots during the synthesis for TEM measurement (Fig. 6A–D). In addition, FTIR spectra of the aliquots taken at different reaction time intervals were also recorded to provide more direct information about the molecular reaction (Fig. 6E–G and S20†). All spectra were normalized to the CC vibration peak at 1641 cm−1 originating from the solvent ODE. In comparison with the CO stretch at 1741 cm−1 from the side product of ester, the IR signals from Zn–O bonds are rather weak and not so sensitive to the local structure evolution of oxide NCs. Therefore, in this work the COO− asymmetric stretch (1541 cm−1) from the metal precursors and the CO stretch (1741 cm−1) from the side product ester were employed as a semi-quantitative probe for monitoring the consumption of metal precursors and formation of oxide NCs (Fig. 6F and G).56 At the early stage of the reaction, high-quality tetrapods were primarily formed with a rapid consumption of metal precursors (Fig. 6A), and then developed into bullet-shaped nanorods in a few minutes (Fig. 6B). Closer observation under HRTEM (Fig. S21†) revealed that the branching arms of tetrapods were readily detached from the main body at the arm/core interfaces, leading to the formation of bullet-shaped nanorods with similar size and shape. From these experimental results, it could be inferred that this phenomenon was closely related to the large lattice strain within doped NCs at the phase interfaces of tetrapods, through the creation of stacking faults under elevated Mn doping.72 Our conclusion was further supported by the findings in Cd doped ZnO tetrapods with Cd(Ac)2 as the dopant precursor (Fig. S22†). The choice of doping Cd was mainly due to the much larger ionic radius of Cd2+ (0.95 Å) than that of Zn2+ (0.74 Å), and therefore elevated Cd doping in ZnO NCs would certainly generate more defects with significant lattice strain at the phase interfaces, as evident in Fig. S22.† Upon prolonged reaction at ca. 290 °C, the bullet-shaped nanorods were gradually converted into spherical NPs (Fig. 6C and D). It is important to notice that during this process the NC volumes remained nearly constant (see Fig. S23†) while the metal precursors were almost depleted to zero (Fig. 6E and F) prior to the shape transition from bullet-shaped nanorods to final spherical NPs, indicative of an intra-particle ripening process.53,73 If only a simple intra-particle material diffusion is going on here during the shape transition of tetrapods into spherical NPs, then the number of NCs and average volumes shall remain nearly constant. The final NPs should have a size of ca. 12.2 nm, with a volume ca. 3.6 times that of the obtained spherical NPs in our work, indicating that the shape transition of tetrapods into spherical NPs was not a simple intra-particle ripening, further supporting our conclusion. From our experiments, it was found that the high reaction temperature and extended reaction time were two important factors that could facilitate greatly the shape transition of doped NCs. Fig. 6  Temporal evolution of the morphologies of Mn doped ZnO NCs from the 10% Mn reaction: (A) 8 min, (B) 15 min, (C) 30 min, and (D) 60 min. Note that the TEM images were obtained directly from the extracted aliquots of NCs without size-selective precipitation. (E) Temporal evolution of FTIR spectra recorded from the 10% Mn reaction. (F and G) Temporal variation of the relative intensities of the COO− asymmetric stretch (1541 cm−1) from the metal precursors and the CO stretch (1741 cm−1) from the side product ester, respectively. The CC stretch at 1641 cm−1 is selected as the standard. During the ripening process, the material of doped NCs was redistributed on the same NC in an intra-particle diffusion manner, toward a thermodynamically more favourable shape. In this regard, we carried out more experiments to address the influence of shape transition on doping in colloidal NCs. ICP-AAS measurement of the 10% Mn doped ZnO NCs during the synthesis revealed that as the reaction proceeded for ca. 1 h with a dramatic shape transition of doped NCs, the Mn doping concentration was only slightly decreased from 5.38 at.% to 4.70 at.% (Fig. S24†), implying that the shape of doped ZnO NCs had no obvious influence on the Mn doping efficiency. This result also suggested that in our case the self-purification or ejection of Mn dopants from the doped ZnO NCs was nearly negligible even at a high reaction temperature for ca. 1 h.34 This fact was supported by the UV-vis observation on the dopant-related absorption features (Fig. S25†), which further confirmed that the majority of the substitutional Mn dopants remained inside of the doped NCs rather than adsorbed on the surfaces.As we know, in some reaction systems surface ligands or foreign ions in the growth medium may play crucial roles in controlling the growth of colloidal NCs.74–76 In this regard, a series of control experiments were conducted to study the impact of free ligands HSt and additional Cl− ions, which might be left in the preparation of the Mn precursor if washed unclearly, on the formation of doped NCs. Preliminary results showed that the added free ligands HSt could affect the reaction by slowing the formation of oxide NCs at the early stage but without altering the reaction pathway and shape transition of doped NCs, as seen in Fig. S26;† while the introduction of certain amounts of Cl− ions in precursors as a mixture of Mn(St)2 and MnCl2 indeed resulted in a significant aggregation of the products just in a few minutes (Fig. S27†). With these results, we concluded that free surface ligands HSt and foreign Cl− ions could play important roles in affecting the synthetic reaction for doped NCs, by slowing the reactivity of metal precursors or accelerating the aggregation of products, respectively.To summarize, further insight was gained by exploring the interaction between growth kinetics and dopant ions. On the basis of the above results, the growth mechanism of doped ZnO NCs with interesting shape transition, from 3D tetrapods to 0D spherical NPs, is illustrated in Scheme 1 with a two-step process. The shape transition of doped NCs was triggered by the detachment of branching arms from the tetrapods, due to the significant lattice strain at the phase interfaces within doped NCs under elevated Mn doping. Then the resulting bullet-shaped nanorods underwent a subsequent ripening process in an intra-particle diffusion manner and were gradually converted into the more stable spherical NPs. Note that during this process, the atoms of doped NCs were redistributed on the same NC, and the ZB phase of the core was changed into the stable WZ phase. Scheme 1  Schematic presentation highlighting the shape transition of Mn doped ZnO NCs from high-quality tetrapods to spherical NPs with two reaction steps. (i) The detachment of branching arms, from the tetrapods at the arm/core interfaces, leads to the formation of bullet-shaped nanorods; (ii) the intra-particle ripening process gradually converts the bullet-shaped nanorods into spherical NPs. The effective incorporation of Mn2+ ions into ZnO crystalline lattices can greatly enhance the visible light photocatalytic properties of doped ZnO NCs. To evaluate the photocatalytic activities of Mn doped ZnO NCs, degradation of RhB in aqueous solution was investigated under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). Fig. 7A shows the results of RhB photodegradation over Mn doped ZnO NCs with different shapes and Mn doping concentrations. Note that the adsorption capacity of RhB molecules on Mn doped ZnO tetrapods is generally higher than that of pure ZnO NPs, possibly due to their larger specific surface areas in branching nanostructures. It was evident that all the samples of Mn doped ZnO NCs exhibited excellent visible light photocatalytic activities for the RhB degradation. After 100 min of irradiation, the 10% Mn doped ZnO tetrapods were found to degrade ca. 86% of the initial RhB dye, while the degradation over 10% Mn doped ZnO spherical NPs was less effective, approaching ca. 74% in the same irradiation time. It is well known that the photocatalytic activities of semiconductor materials are closely related to their morphology, structure, chemical composition and surface properties.77 Therefore the much improved photocatalytic performance of Mn doped ZnO tetrapods over spherical NPs is probably associated with their special 3D branching nanostructures. Moreover, there may be more active sites and exposed reactive facets within these anisotropic tetrapods, which would facilitate the separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes, and contribute to the improvement of the photocatalytic activities. We also studied the effect of Mn doping concentrations on the photocatalytic activities of doped ZnO NCs. The introduction of dopant energy levels within the bandgap through Mn doping has a significant influence on the photocatalytic activities of doped ZnO NCs. It is important to notice that an enhanced optical response in the visible region, induced by elevated Mn doping, does not simply result in improved photocatalytic performance of materials. Moreover, there was an optimal Mn doping concentration in ZnO NCs for the visible light photocatalysis. When the Mn doping concentration was further increased, the Mn dopant sites could also act as efficient recombination centers with increased recombination rate due to the reduced average distance between trapped carriers.65 The excess Mn dopant sites could greatly decrease the number of charge carriers and deteriorate the visible light photocatalytic performance of doped ZnO NCs, as identified from Fig. 7A. Preliminary results revealed that the 5% Mn doped ZnO tetrapods exhibited the highest visible light photocatalytic activity, degrading ca. 94% of the RhB in 100 min. Fig. 7  (A) Degradation of RhB solutions over ZnO and Mn doped ZnO NCs with different Mn concentrations and shapes under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). The photolysis of RhB is added for comparison. (B) UV-vis spectral variations of RhB solution over 10% Mn doped ZnO tetrapods under visible light; the inset shows the picture of 10% Mn doped ZnO tetrapod powders. (C) Schematic illustration of a proposed photocatalytic mechanism of Mn doped ZnO NCs under visible light (λ > 420 nm). The bandgap energy of ZnO is ca. 3.40 eV and the Mn dopant energy levels are localized within the bandgap of ZnO. To gain further insight into the photocatalytic reaction, the UV-vis spectral changes of RhB solution over 10% Mn doped ZnO tetrapods during the photodegradation are shown in Fig. 7B. The absorption band of RhB solution exhibits two typical features: one is the rapid decrease of absorption bands in both UV and visible regions, and the other is the blue-shift of the absorption maximum. Under visible light irradiation, the absorption maximum of RhB solution shifts gradually from 553 to 498 nm with the color of dispersion changing from pink to nearly colorless. These spectral changes are associated with the complete N-deethylation of RhB dye during the initial period and a concomitant oxidation destruction of the aromatic rings during photocatalysis.78On the basis of our experimental results and reported literature, a proposed mechanism for the visible light photocatalysis of Mn doped ZnO NCs is illustrated in Fig. 7C. As we know, the effective Mn doping in ZnO NCs could modify the energy band of ZnO, through the creation of localized Mn dopant energy levels within the bandgap. Under visible light illumination, the photogenerated electrons could easily transfer from the VB of ZnO to the localized Mn energy levels, along with the d–d transitions between the Mn dopant energy levels.66,67 The excited electrons were readily trapped in these Mn dopant sites, while the photogenerated holes were left in the valence band of ZnO and migrated to the surface of doped NCs, yielding active radical species (mainly ˙OH) to decompose the RhB dye. Therefore through the incorporation of suitable amounts of Mn dopant ions in ZnO NCs as effective trapping sites, the photogenerated electrons and holes could be efficiently separated and the recombination of these charge carriers was greatly inhibited, resulting in improved photocatalytic activities under visible light.ConclusionsIn conclusion, we have demonstrated the colloidal synthesis of high-quality Mn doped ZnO NCs with desired compositions and shapes, by using a facile and green synthetic approach in a non-coordinating solvent. In this system, the introduction of Mn dopants can greatly influence the crystal growth and the resulting properties of doped NCs as follows: (1) the incorporated Mn dopants can modify the crystalline structure at the primary growth stage and lead to the occurrence of the ZB phase, essential for the formation of tetrapods; (2) distinct size mismatch between dopant Mn2+ and host Zn2+ ions under elevated Mn doping results in the appearance of significant lattice strain, facilitating the detachment of branching arms from tetrapods, critical for the shape transition of doped ZnO NCs; (3) the incorporation of Mn2+ ions into ZnO NCs can extend their absorption to the visible light region, desirable for efficient visible light photocatalysis.By employing Mn(St)2 as the suitable Mn precursor, the Mn doping concentrations of doped ZnO NCs could be tuned in a wide range by varying Mn precursor concentrations. Specifically, the shape of doped ZnO NCs could be finely modulated from 3D tetrapods to 0D spherical NPs in a single reaction scheme. The growth mechanism of doped ZnO NCs with interesting shape transition was explored and suggested as a two-step process, which involved the detachment of branching arms from tetrapods at the phase interfaces and the subsequent intra-particle ripening. In addition, we demonstrated the tunable optical absorption features of doped ZnO NCs by varying the Mn doping levels, and the enhanced photocatalytic performance of Mn doped ZnO NCs under visible light with respect to pure ZnO, which could be further optimized by controlling their shapes and Mn doping concentrations.These findings could not only pave the way for the rational design of complex nanostructures with controlled composition, phase and shape to achieve desirable functions, but also provide a more comprehensive understanding of the growth mechanism of doped NCs during the growth process. Due to the simplicity and generality of the present synthetic route, we believe that insight revealed on the basis of Mn doping in ZnO NCs can be potentially extended to ZnO NCs doped with other metal ions, such as Co2+, Ni2+ and Cd2+, for various applications in photocatalysis, solar cells, sensors and spintronic devices.AcknowledgementsThis work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant no. 51172204, 51072181, and 51372224 and Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China under Grant no. 2012M511360.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (A) TEM image of Mn doped ZnO tetrapods from the 10% Mn reaction. (B) HRTEM image of a single tetrapod with one branching arm pointing upward, indicating the hexagonal WZ structure of the arm. (C) HRTEM image of the central region of a bipod and (D) the corresponding 2D atomic simulation, respectively, clearly showing the presence of stacking faults (SFs) commonly observed at the ZB core/WZ arm interfaces, as indicated by the arrows.	 

 	Fig. 2  (A) Typical TEM image of Mn doped ZnO spherical NPs from the 10% Mn reaction, highlighting their size and shape monodispersity. (B and C) HRTEM images of Mn doped ZnO NPs with the hexagonal WZ structure, viewed from different directions. (D) Three-dimensional (3D) rendering of an atomic model of Mn doped ZnO spherical NPs with the WZ structure (not in scale).	 

 	Fig. 3  (A) Powder XRD patterns of Mn doped ZnO tetrapods and NPs from the 10% Mn reactions. The diffraction peaks of bulk WZ ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451) and pure ZnO NPs synthesized under similar reaction conditions are included for comparison. (B) UV-vis absorption spectra of Mn doped ZnO tetrapods and NPs from the 10% Mn reactions, exhibiting the emergence of an absorption band toward the visible region and a slight blue-shift of the absorption edge in comparison with that of pure ZnO NPs. (C) Mn K-edge XANES spectra of Mn doped ZnO tetrapods and NPs from the 10% Mn reactions. All spectra are normalized and shifted for clarity.	 

 	Fig. 4  (A) EPR spectra of 5% Mn doped ZnO NPs at 100 K and 300 K and (B) EPR spectra of 5% and 10% Mn doped ZnO tetrapods at 100 K.	 

 	Fig. 5  (A and B) UV-vis spectra of Mn doped ZnO tetrapods and spherical NPs with different Mn precursor concentrations as indicated in the plots, respectively. The absorption spectra of pure ZnO NPs are also added for comparison. (C) Mn doping concentrations in the resulting doped NCs with different shapes as a function of the Mn precursor concentrations in the reagents.	 

 	Fig. 6  Temporal evolution of the morphologies of Mn doped ZnO NCs from the 10% Mn reaction: (A) 8 min, (B) 15 min, (C) 30 min, and (D) 60 min. Note that the TEM images were obtained directly from the extracted aliquots of NCs without size-selective precipitation. (E) Temporal evolution of FTIR spectra recorded from the 10% Mn reaction. (F and G) Temporal variation of the relative intensities of the COO− asymmetric stretch (1541 cm−1) from the metal precursors and the CO stretch (1741 cm−1) from the side product ester, respectively. The CC stretch at 1641 cm−1 is selected as the standard.	 

 	Scheme 1  Schematic presentation highlighting the shape transition of Mn doped ZnO NCs from high-quality tetrapods to spherical NPs with two reaction steps. (i) The detachment of branching arms, from the tetrapods at the arm/core interfaces, leads to the formation of bullet-shaped nanorods; (ii) the intra-particle ripening process gradually converts the bullet-shaped nanorods into spherical NPs.	 

 	Fig. 7  (A) Degradation of RhB solutions over ZnO and Mn doped ZnO NCs with different Mn concentrations and shapes under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). The photolysis of RhB is added for comparison. (B) UV-vis spectral variations of RhB solution over 10% Mn doped ZnO tetrapods under visible light; the inset shows the picture of 10% Mn doped ZnO tetrapod powders. (C) Schematic illustration of a proposed photocatalytic mechanism of Mn doped ZnO NCs under visible light (λ > 420 nm). The bandgap energy of ZnO is ca. 3.40 eV and the Mn dopant energy levels are localized within the bandgap of ZnO.
