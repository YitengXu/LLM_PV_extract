    , Accepted 8th March 2019First published on 12th March 2019AbstractGold nanoraspberries were synthesized by a seed-mediated synthesis with polyethylene glycol-functionalized bisphosphonates. The original structure shifted the optical absorption to infrared, revealing very efficient photothermal properties within the 2nd biological transparency window and leading to cancer cell necrosis at moderate intracellular doses and low (safe) laser power.
Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have unique surface plasmonic resonance leading to remarkable light conversion into heat.1 These optical properties provide GNPs the potential of being efficient photothermal therapy (PTT) agents. For cancer PTT, it is necessary to activate the GNPs in the near-infrared (NIR) region to minimize light absorption of laser radiation by surrounding biological tissues.2 Two biological transparency windows can be distinguished: the first from 650 nm to 950 nm (NIR-I) and the second from 1000 to 1350 nm (NIR-II). In practice, NIR-I is not optimal due to limited tissue penetration depth lower than 2 cm.3 NIR-II is recognized to offer more efficient tissue penetration when considering absorption and scattering effects in tissue.4 To modulate the plasmonic resonance to the NIR, anisotropic GNPs such as nanorods, nanostars and nanoshells have been proposed and experimented for cancer thermotherapy.5 Both rods and stars GNPs are obtained by seed-mediated synthesis methods using surfactants6 limiting their clinical translation7 together with the complexity of replacing these surfactants.8 Additionally, GNPs used in hyperthermia often have sizes between 50 and 150 nm to reach relevant heating within NIR light absorption9 and leading to large hydrodynamic sizes higher than 100 nm.5b,10 In this case, they are quickly uptaken and sequestered by the reticulo endothelial system (RES). Nanostructures working in the NIR-II remain rare and still have challenges to face,11e.g. (i) the need of a size below 50 nm to be used in the intravenous route, (ii) a design with gold only to avoid potential long-term toxicity due to other metals and (iii) the use of biocompatible agents for nucleation and coating. The structures reported up to now for efficient heating in the NIR-II either have sizes12 over the 200 nm cutoff for penetration within tumors blood capillaries,13 or are composed of potentially toxic14 elements such as Ag/CTAB2 or Cu.15 Recently gold-only raspberry-like structures coated with chitosan have been reported with plasmonic absorption in the NIR-I, but not in the NIR-II.16
Herein, we describe the synthesis of a unique gold-core raspberry-shell structure based on a seed-mediated approach using hydroxyl methylene bisphosphonate (HMBP) molecules bearing polyethylene glycol (PEG) for in vivo stealth17 and terminal carboxylic function (COOH) for direct bio-functionalization.18 HMBPs compounds are clinically approved for numerous treatments in bone disorder pathologies19 but also as anti-cancer agents, anti-parasitic agents and bone imaging agents.20 Furthermore, we demonstrated in previous work that HMBP-S-PEG45-COOH polymer was capable of effectively stabilizing monocrystalline GNPs in physiological medium, and could be efficiently further functionalized.21
We propose a protocol involving HMBP compounds based on a seed-mediated procedure used for the synthesis of gold nanorods and nanostars.6 We substituted HMBP-S-PEG45-COOH for CTAB or PVP in order to avoid any step of ligand exchange. The surfactant plays an important role in the synthesis of nanorods and nanostars since it acts as a “surface poison” by passivating definite crystalline faces and allows the control of the morphology and size growth.6a,22 The objective was to determine whether the structure of HMBP-S-PEG45-COOH influences crystal growth to obtain a precise geometry and to characterize the optical properties derived therefrom. Thus, we adapted the three stages of the synthesis “by growth on seeds” (Scheme S1, ESI†) as follows: (a) the growth solution was prepared with HMBP-S-PEG45-COOH as a ligand and reductant to stabilize the Au(I) complex and with ascorbic acid to accelerate the reaction at room temperature. (b) 10 nm “seeds” were then added to the growth solution. (c) Multicore growth was proceeded on each GNP “seed”. In order to favor a homogeneous process, we chose to use 10 nm GNPs@HMBPene as seeds because they present a low dispersion in size and can be synthesized in relatively large quantities.23 We monitored the synthesis of GNPs by in situ UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 1a). From the first minute of the reaction, GNPs absorbed over the entire spectral range at the beginning of crystalline growth. The intensity increase is correlated to the GNPs growth. The synthesis process was ended after one hour at room temperature. The absorption spectrum is remarkably wide compared to other GNPs used for PTT such as nanorods and nanostars.5 Transmission electron microscope (TEM) imaging showed that HMBP-S-PEG45-COOH successfully yielded uniform GNPs with multicore morphology (Fig. 1b). The nanoraspberries were 36.8 ± 3.0 nm in diameter. High-resolution TEM image (Fig. 1c) further showed that each particle contains multiple crystal domains. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) (Fig. S2, ESI†) of the images directly reflected the polycrystalline nature of the GNPs. The nanostructures are formed by several small GNPs (6.4 ± 0.7 nm diameter), which were observed to be single crystals, grown around a central Au seed (10 nm diameter). It was also observed that there is a layer (1–2 nm) of organic based material coating GNPs attributed to the PEG shell. For this reason, we propose a mechanism of formation by gold growth of a network of compact spheres around each GNP seed (Scheme S1, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  Kinetic growth mechanism and structural characterization of nanoraspberries. (a) UV absorbance spectra of the synthesis as a function of time. (b) TEM image (c) high-magnification TEM image. The nanostructure consists of multiple small GNPs, of which many are observed to be single crystals. (d) STEM-EDS analysis which provides an elemental distribution of gold (green), phosphorus (red) and sulfur (blue) from the HMBP-S-PEG45-COOH and their overlap. 
Theoretical diameter D can be calculated with a “nanoraspberry model” (see details within ESI†) leading to a theoretical diameter of 37.6 nm in perfect agreement with the 36.8 ± 3.0 nm experimental value, confirming the multicore growth on each NP seed. We deduce that the pure gold structure corresponds to a 10 nm core surrounded by a 17 nm raspberry shell. The nanoraspberry size can be modulated by varying the concentration ratio between Au precursor and Au seeds (Fig. S1, ESI†). Hence, the “non-spherical” nature of the as-synthesized nanoraspberries turns into an absorption spectrum which covers the first and second NIR regions at the difference of the other raspberry-like structures reported.16
Consequently, they represent promising PTT agents in the NIR. Fig. 1d shows the elemental distribution of Au, P and S obtained from STEM-EDS analysis. Although the distribution of the three elements is relatively homogeneous across the particle, P and S signals were observed to cover over a slightly larger region over the particle, compared to the Au signals. As shown in the overlap map, P (red) and S (blue) signals, from HMBP-S-PEG45-COOH molecules, appear to be on the outline of the Au (green) map, which is an indication that P and S are on the nanoparticle surface. Usually when a given element is located only on the surface of a particle, the elemental map shows enrichment over the edges or sides.24 However this is not exactly observed here in the P and S maps, likely because the entire particle is made up of multiple small particles with their surfaces overlapping one another on a two-dimensional image. Hence homogeneous P and S distribution around Au signals indicates also the homogeneous HMBP-S-PEG45-COOH coating within the entire multicore NPs volume. The coating efficiency is also confirmed by FTIR (Fig. S3, ESI†). The presence of PEG chains is clearly visible with a strong C–O vibration at 1100 cm−1. Moreover, CO vibration bands at 1610 cm−1 are also clearly identified demonstrating the presence of the carboxylic group at the surface of GNPs for further bio-coupling.
The stability of nanomaterials is a key parameter for biomedical applications. Nanoraspberries were stable over time (up to two days) in PBS and HBSS, buffers commonly used for in vivo applications, and for 24 h in cell culture medium, with an onset aggregation at 48 h (Fig. 2a). The hydrodynamic diameter and surface zeta potential of the nanoraspberries were found to be 41.3 ± 18.4 nm and −15.0 ± 1.3 mV, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†). Considering the average size of the nanoraspberries (36.8 nm in diameter) and a layer of PEG coating,25 this hydrodynamic diameter value suggests very low aggregation of the nanomaterials. The negative zeta potential confirms the carboxylate function at the outer surface of the GNP. The number of HMBP-S-PEG45-COOH molecules per nanoraspberry was determined by elemental analysis (ICP) and was found to be 0.09 HMBP-S-PEG45-COOH molecule per Au atom. This important number of HMBP-S-PEG45-COOH is a consequence of the higher specific surface provided by the raspberry shape compared to a spherical one. It is in agreement with the results obtained by the elemental analysis mapping (Fig. 1d) suggesting the presence of HMBP-S-PEG45-COOH homogeneously anchored within all the volume and not only at the surface. Assuming a multicore structure made of 6.4 nm spheres, the coating density can be estimated to a surface area of 18 Å2 for each PEGylated ligand molecule (details within the ESI†) in good agreement with results obtained from the surface modification with phosphonate moieties.23,26 Hence, the high PEG density should decrease the uptake by the RES and improve the long-term GNPs biodistribution.27

(b) Typical infrared images of nanoraspberries and nanorods at [Au] = 1 mM, after 5 minutes illumination at 680, 808 and 1064 nm, generating photothermia (0.3 W cm−2). (c) Average temperature elevation (ΔT, in °C) for PTT at 0.3 W cm−2 with lasers 680, 808 and 1064 nm at [Au] = 1 mM for nanoraspberries and nanorods. (d) Average temperature elevation (ΔT, in °C) for PTT at 0.3 W cm−2 with lasers 680, 808 and 1064 nm with concentrations ranging from [Au] = 0.125 mM to [Au] = 2 mM for nanoraspberries (left), nanorods 680 (center) and nanorods 810 (right). (e) Quantification of apoptotic and necrotic cells 24 hours post treatment by flow cytometry with annexin V and propidium iodide labeling, and for the both 808 and 1064 nm laser treatment at final sample concentration of [Au] = 0.5 mM and 2 mM. 
Nanoraspberries were tested as PTT agents (Fig. S5, ESI† for experimental settings and typical curves) and compared with gold nanorods considered as state-of-the art for PTT applications, exhibiting a plasmon maximum at 680 nm (nanorods 680) and at 810 nm (nanorods 810) (Fig. S6, ESI† for absorbance curves and Table S2 for absorption coefficients). A comparison of the heating efficiency of these particles when submitted to different laser wavelengths (680, 808 and 1064 nm) at 0.3 W cm−2 was first performed at gold concentration of 1 mM (Fig. S7, ESI† for 0.5 mM). Heating was recorded with an infrared camera (Fig. 2b) and expressed as the temperature plateau reached after 5 minutes of laser illumination (Fig. 2c). The concentration-renormalized specific absorption rate (SAR) parameter28 was then further computed for all conditions (Fig. S8, ESI†). SAR of nanoraspberries are in the range of 10000 W g−1 of Au, similar to SAR reported for other state-of-the-art nanoheaters, such as gold nanostars, or gold nanoshells.9 Heating of nanorods was maximum at wavelengths close from their optical absorbance maximum, i.e. 808 nm for nanorods 810 and 680 nm for nanorods 680. The lowest heating was observed for the three GNPs at 1064 nm, but corresponded to a 10-fold decrease for nanorods 680 and only 1.5-fold for nanoraspberries. The latest were the most efficient nano-heaters at 1064 nm (NIR-II), generating a significant heating of more than 10 °C.
The heating efficiency of nanoraspberries and nanorods was further studied for gold concentrations ranging from 0.125 mM to 2 mM (Fig. 2d). Note that the differences in temperature efficiencies are more visible at lower concentrations, which is of interest for biomedical applications to reach an efficient therapy with a low GNPs amount. Note also that the temperature increase tends to saturate at high concentrations. Over the panel of concentrations studied, nanoraspberries are competitive with nanorods and state of the art nano-heaters5b,9 when illuminated at 680 and 808 nm, but they exhibit a better heating at 1064 nm. Consequently, they appear more polyvalent for biomedical applications depending on tumour depth and accessible laser setting. Note finally that the seed-mediated gold nanoraspberries combine the advantages of a gold-only composition, biocompatible ligands, small size suited for intravenous delivery, and efficient NIR-II heating. Finally, the heat conversion parameter η was determined for all nanoparticles, at the three wavelengths (Fig. S9, ESI†). The values of η are close to about 65% and do not vary significantly for the three wavelengths used. This demonstrates that (i) the three objects, with their specific size and shape, exhibit a similar ability for photothermal conversion, and (ii) the ratio of the light absorption to the light scattering cross sections is roughly the same for the three wavelengths under investigation, confirming the competitiveness of nanoraspberries with state-of-the-art nanorods. As a consequence of the fact that all three nanomaterials have similar conversion efficiencies (η), at high concentration the temperature elevation ΔT is found in the same 20 °C range for a power density of 0.3 W cm−2. This reflects the linear relationship between η and ΔT28 (see ESI† for details). Besides, ΔT linearly increases with laser intensity at fixed gold concentration, and at an intensity of 0.6 W cm−2 saturation with increasing [Au] is reached at ∼40 °C for all samples (Fig. S10, ESI†).
PTT is a strategy to induce cancer cells death. As a consequence, the efficiency of nanoraspberries needs to be evaluated within those targets. Nanoraspberries were incubated with PC3 prostatic cancer cells for 17 hours. The cell capture was quantified by ICP (Fig. S11, ESI†). Two conditions were selected corresponding to 0.9 and 3.8 pg of Au per cell, for an incubation at [Au] = 10 and 40 μM, respectively. After internalization, cells were treated for 10 minutes at low power of 0.3 W cm−2 with both 808 nm (NIR-I) and 1064 nm (NIR-II) lasers. The therapeutic efficiency was then assessed 24 hours post treatment by flow cytometry. At 3.8 pg of gold per cell, an almost complete cancer cell death was reached after treatment by the lasers 808 nm and 1064 nm with only 1.8% and 2.7% remaining viable cells, respectively. For a lower gold concentration of 0.9 pg of gold per cell, PTT treatment left 23.5% (808 nm) and 26.6% (1064 nm) viable cells (Fig. 2e). Fig. S12, ESI,† indicates the proportion of early apoptotic cells (annexin V positive) and necrotic (propidium iodide (PI) positive) cells showing the possibility to reach high percentages of necrotic cells with PTT treatments at low laser power. In the same conditions, cell death induced by the laser 808 nm and 1064 nm were comparable, as expected from the large absorbance spectra of the nanoraspberry in the NIR, confirming their potential for PTT treatments at different wavelengths and safe (0.3 W cm−2) laser power.
In conclusion, we successfully designed and produced gold nanoraspberries through an all-in-one seed-on-growth mediated synthesis, taking advantage of HMBP-S-PEG45-COOH as dual reducing and chelating agent. The agreement between a theoretical model and the evolution of the UV-Vis absorption spectrum in real time confirmed a mechanism of formation by gold growth on individual seeds. The nanostructures optical properties were clearly spanning in the NIR with a very large plasmonic resonance allowing their irradiation at different wavelength within both NIR-I and NIR-II. Nanoraspberries were finally found to be promising agents for PTT, and successfully heated the cells at cytotoxic levels at safe laser power.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Kinetic growth mechanism and structural characterization of nanoraspberries. (a) UV absorbance spectra of the synthesis as a function of time. (b) TEM image (c) high-magnification TEM image. The nanostructure consists of multiple small GNPs, of which many are observed to be single crystals. (d) STEM-EDS analysis which provides an elemental distribution of gold (green), phosphorus (red) and sulfur (blue) from the HMBP-S-PEG45-COOH and their overlap.	 

 	Fig. 2  Biological behavior and PTT properties. (a) Evolution of the hydrodynamic diameter (in z average) for the nanoraspberries dispersed in HBSS, PBS and RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, over 48 h. (b) Typical infrared images of nanoraspberries and nanorods at [Au] = 1 mM, after 5 minutes illumination at 680, 808 and 1064 nm, generating photothermia (0.3 W cm−2). (c) Average temperature elevation (ΔT, in °C) for PTT at 0.3 W cm−2 with lasers 680, 808 and 1064 nm at [Au] = 1 mM for nanoraspberries and nanorods. (d) Average temperature elevation (ΔT, in °C) for PTT at 0.3 W cm−2 with lasers 680, 808 and 1064 nm with concentrations ranging from [Au] = 0.125 mM to [Au] = 2 mM for nanoraspberries (left), nanorods 680 (center) and nanorods 810 (right). (e) Quantification of apoptotic and necrotic cells 24 hours post treatment by flow cytometry with annexin V and propidium iodide labeling, and for the both 808 and 1064 nm laser treatment at final sample concentration of [Au] = 0.5 mM and 2 mM.
