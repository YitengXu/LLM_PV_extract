    , Accepted 2nd May 2016First published on 23rd May 2016AbstractThis feature article discusses the highly promising and versatile electrospinning methods and electrospun materials employed for the fabrication of solar cells. Electrospinning is attractive for creating one dimensional mesostructured organic, inorganic and hybrid nanomaterials of controlled dimensions, prepared as random or oriented continuous nanofibers (NFs), with possibilities of ordered internal morphologies such as core–sheath, hollow or porous fibres, or even multichanneled microtube arrangements. The dimensionality, directionality and compositional flexibility of electrospun NFs and mats are increasingly being investigated for the targeted development of electrode and electrolyte materials, where the specific properties associated with nanoscale features such as high surface areas and aspect ratios, low density and high pore volume allow performance improvements in solar energy conversion devices.

1. Introduction
During the last decade, the dramatic growth of advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices, and related technologies, has been inherently associated with the development of innovative nanomaterials. Around the world academic and industrial researchers have focused their studies on designing and synthesizing new nanomaterials exhibiting tailor-made properties for various application domains including information and communication technologies,1,2 biotechnologies and health care technologies,3 sensing,4–6 and energy conversion and storage.7–9
In this particular field, nanostructured materials appear to be valuable components to decrease the weight of energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors,10–12 or to boost the performances of photovoltaic and thermoelectric devices.13–16 The preparation of nanomaterials requires the development of specific methods and processes by scientists in order to control the shape of these nano-objects, their dimensions and their chemical composition. Among the techniques and tools developed for the preparation of nanomaterials, electrospinning appears to be one of the most powerful and versatile methods. Indeed this wonderful technique that was discovered more than one hundred years ago by Coley,17 and later developed by Formhals,18 allows for the fabrication of a large variety of nanostructured and mesostructured inorganic, organic, and hybrid materials.
Nowadays the tremendous interest of the scientific community in electrospinning originates first from its unique capability of creating nanostructures from ceramic materials. This remarkably simple technique is applicable to all condensable materials, spanning from polymer solutions to molten materials, and it allows the production of ceramic nanofibers (NFs) with either a dense, porous, or hollow structure when it is combined with conventional sol–gel processing followed by high temperature calcination. One of the great advantages of this technique is the possibility to tune accurately the chemical composition and the dimensions of the synthesized nanomaterials. Besides, the control of the directional arrangement of the nano-objects as well as the surface coverage can be achieved on various surfaces.19 From an application point of view electrospinning is a cost-effective method that can be easily scaled-up making it very economically attractive and compatible with industrial requirements.12 For the above mentioned reasons, electrospinning methods were developed and employed in recent years for the fabrication of various material electrodes suitable for energy conversion and storage applications.20
In this review, we will discuss some of the most interesting features associated with the electrospinning technique for the preparation of nanomaterials of interest, particularly for photovoltaic energy conversion. We will introduce the key principles of the electrospinning process and highlight the potential of electrospun materials by presenting the various morphologies that can be obtained, and the diverse compositions of binary or ternary metal oxide semiconductors or doped materials that can be achieved.
We will attempt to provide a detailed overview of the various materials made so far by electrospinning and shed light on the recent developments involving electrospun materials in emerging photovoltaic technologies such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), organic solar cells (OPV) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs).
2. Electrospinning background and basic principles
2.1 Electrospinning process
Electrospinning is a kind of spinning based on the use of electrostatic force. It has been employed as a powerful tool to produce high-quality organic and/or inorganic fibers, which reveal nanometer scale diameters and larger surface areas than the conventional fibers obtained from other spinning techniques such as melt-spinning and dry-spinning.20 A schematic illustration of electrospinning and NF-synthetic processes is shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  (a) Electrospinning equipment. (b) Inorganic precursor/polymer composite electrospun nanofiber (‘as-spun nanofiber’). (c) Metal oxide nanofiber after high-temperature heat treatment in an air atmosphere. (d and e) SEM images of the as-spun NFs and the metal oxide NFs corresponding to (b) and (c), respectively. 

Fig. 1(a) shows a typical electrospinning set-up, which is basically composed of three major parts: (i) a small diameter-needle syringe including electrospinning solution (composed of a highly viscous polymer and various precursors (e.g. inorganic precursors), which are dissolved in solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), deionized (DI) water, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and ethanol), (ii) a high voltage power supplier, and (iii) a grounded collector (usually a conducting metallic plate). The nonwoven one-dimensional NFs are simply synthesized by applying a high voltage (electric field) between a needle syringe tip and the grounded collector.
Firstly, the electrospinning solution is fed by a syringe pump and an electric field is applied to induce an electrified jet. During electrospinning, the hemispherical surface of the solution at the tip of the needle is electrically charged and continuously elongated to develop a cone-shape (referred to as a ‘Taylor cone’) upon increasing the voltage.21 When the applied electric field reaches a sufficient value (over critical value), repulsive force between the charged surface and evaporation of solvent is larger than the surface tension of the solution.22 A charged jet of the solution is then injected from the tip of the spinneret. Even though the jet is stable near to the end of the needle, the erupted solution goes through an unstable elongation process and a rapid whipping of the jet arises in space between the capillary tip and collector. Meanwhile, a solvent is evaporated, and the precursors and/or polymer fibers are collected on a ground plate in the form of a nonwoven matrix. Fig. 1(b) shows the long and thin electrospun fibers (the so-called ‘as-spun fibers’) obtained using a strong polymer template allowing the jet to be unbreakable. The as-spun fibers can be easily changed to metal oxide NFs by subsequent thermal treatment in an air atmosphere, resulting in the simultaneous removal of the matrix polymer and crystallite growth due to the oxidation of the inorganic precursor (Fig. 1(c)). As an example, Fig. 1(d) and (e) show the SEM images of as-spun Sn precursor/PVP composite fibers and SnO2 NFs calcined at 500 °C for 2 h, clearly revealing the morphological change before and after high temperature calcination.
2.2 Parameters influencing the electrospinning process
The electrospinning process is greatly influenced by several parameters, which can be categorized as follows:
(i) Operating parameters such as applied power voltage, the solution flow or feeding rate, the shape or gauge of needle, and the tip-to-collector distance.
(ii) Solution parameters such as the type of polymer matrix and solvent, solubility and viscosity of the solutions, molecular weight of the polymer, precursor type and its compatibility with other components.23
(iii) Environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity.24
Through optimized handling of these parameters, one can prepare NFs with desired morphology, microstructure, and composition. To illustrate this versatility, we show some examples of various morphological evolutions of the electrospun NFs as functions of processing parameters (Fig. 2). Fig. 2(a)–(c) show the morphologies and microstructures of electrospun TiO2 fibers synthesized by using different polymers such as polystyrene (PS), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc).25 As shown in Fig. 2(a), TiO2 NFs prepared by the removal of the PS template are composed of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) of ca. 30 nm, which are obtained from fast phase separation driven by immiscibility between the PS polymer and Ti precursors. PMMA has better miscibility with the Ti-precursor than PS. This feature leads to the formation of a smooth cladding surface layer, which is distinctly different from inner TiO2 NPs (Fig. 2(b)). In the case of PVAc-driven TiO2 fibers (Fig. 2(c)), the TiO2 fibers showed a fibrillar structure elongated along the fiber direction. It is important to note that the solidification of TiO2 depends on the phase separation between selected polymers and Ti precursors. As a consequence, the phase separation in the PS matrix occurs suddenly in the immiscible system, resulting in the formation of polycrystalline TiO2 fibers consisting of small NPs. In contrast, in the case of the PVAc matrix, the phase separation proceeds slowly, and then Ti precursor-rich domains and PVAc-rich domains co-exist and allow the domain stretching in the 1D direction during the electrospinning process. After calcination, the PVAc matrix is removed, resulting in the formation of open pores while Ti precursor-rich domains are converted to TiO2 phases. In parallel with the polymer parameter, electrospinning solution feeding speed (low, intermediate and fast flow rates) has significant effects on the morphology control of the NFs. For example, Fig. 2(d)–(f) show the SEM and TEM images of as-spun fibers and calcined SnO2 NFs at a very high flow rate (25 μL min−1).26 When a fast injection rate is used, the solution jet was stretched in the spinning direction. The large amount of solvent erupted from the end of the tip results in the tremendous evaporation of solvent every moment, which allows unstable fluctuations of solution. The as-spun Sn precursor/PVAc composite fibers, as shown in Fig. 2(d), showed rough surface morphologies with elongated bumpy voids along the fiber direction. During heat-treatment, a number of furrows in the as-spun fibers were converted into elongated open holes at the surface and inner part of the fibers. The small and large crevices indicated by blue arrows and dotted yellow frames in Fig. 2(d)–(f) are clear evidence for the effect of flow rate control assisted by the phase separation. In addition, facile synthesis of core–shell, multi-walled tubular and multichannel structures via an electrospinning route has been successfully demonstrated (Fig. 2(g)–(i)). Fig. 2(g) shows the SEM image of a coaxial bundle of anatase TiO2 hollow NFs prepared by dual-nozzle electrospinning.27 In a typical procedure, a spinneret including two viscous and immiscible solutions is simultaneously fed through two co-axial capillaries.
 Fig. 2  The SEM images show the morphologies of electrospun NFs, depending on various parameters such as (a–c) different kinds of polymers; (d–f) solution feeding rate; (g–i) the shape of the needle; (j–l) pressing. (a)–(c) show the SEM images of TiO2 NFs prepared from (a) PS, (b) PMMA and (c) PVAc (reproduced with permission from ref. 25. Copyright 2005 Taylor & Francis Group). (d)–(f) show the SEM image of (d) as-spun Sn precursors/PVAc composite fibers, (e) SEM image and (f) TEM image of calcined SnO2 NFs at the high feeding rate (reproduced with permission from ref. 26.

(j) and (k) show the SEM images of the as-spun fibers of Ti precursors/PVAc composites (j) before and (k) after hot-pressing, and (l) shows the SEM image of hot-pressed TiO2 nanofibers after calcinations at 450 °C (reproduced with permission from ref. 30. Copyright 2006 American Chemical Society). 
The matrix polymer in the core and shell is eliminated, and the Ti-precursor loaded in only the matrix shell undergoes oxidation and crystallization to form crystalline TiO2 fibers during calcination. In a similar way (the so-called ‘multi-fluidic coaxial electrospinning’), independent TiO2 nanofibers (Fig. 2(h))28 and Y-shaped TiO2 nanofibers (Fig. 2(i)),29 which are embedded in the center of TiO2 microtubes, were also synthesized. In order to improve the adhesion strength between fiber mats and underlying substrates, a thermo-compression step was introduced prior to the calcination step. Fig. 2(j)–(l) show the morphological difference between as-spun fibers and hot-pressed fibers.30 The as-spun fibers without hot-pressing treatment exhibit typical nanofiber mats (Fig. 2(j)), and on the other hand, hot-pressed fibers show an interconnected network structure due to the partial melting of the PVAc matrix polymer at low glass transition temperature (Fig. 2(k)). Subsequently, after the calcination step at 450 °C for 30 min, highly porous TiO2 NFs composed of single crystalline anatase nanorods (NRs) are achieved (Fig. 2(l)).
3. Electrospun materials for DSSCs
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are photo-electrochemical devices capable of converting solar radiation directly into electricity. Basically, they consist of a photoanode and a counter electrode separated by an electrolyte that can be a liquid or an ionic liquid containing a redox couple. Alternatively, a hole transporting material (HTM) can be used to replace the liquid element. The breakthrough in the photon to electron conversion efficiency of DSSCs was achieved in the early 1990s when Grätzel and O'Regan used a colloidal TiO2 film to fabricate a mesoporous photoanode in replacement of bulk materials employed so far.31,32 Since this discovery, DSSCs have attracted considerable interest due to their low cost fabrication process, their short energy payback time and their relatively high conversion efficiency and stability.33 Besides, this technology is compatible with large area surfaces, and in the last few years industrial developments have successfully demonstrated its potential for building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).34,35
In a typical DSSC, the photoanode is composed of a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) coated with a nanostructured film of a wide band gap metal oxide semiconductor. The counter electrode usually employed is a TCO coated with a thin layer of platinum. In these devices light is absorbed by a photo-sensitizer attached to the metal oxide surface through an anchoring function. Upon irradiation, the electrons are injected from the excited state of the dye into the conduction band of the semiconductor and transported to the counter electrode through an external circuit. In the meantime the oxidized dye is regenerated thanks to the redox system present in the electrolyte which is itself reduced at the counter electrode. The detailed description of the basic working principles can be found elsewhere.36,37
Among the fruitful strategies to improve the performances of DSSCs, one consists of increasing the short-circuit current density (Jsc) delivered by the solar cells by improving the light harvesting efficiency of the photoanodes. On one hand, this can be achieved by synthesizing new sensitizers showing a higher molar absorption coefficient and revealing absorption domains better matching the solar emission spectrum.38 On the other hand, this goal can also be achieved by developing nanostructured electrode materials presenting light scattering properties and showing dramatically enhanced specific surface areas, in order to increase the number of dye molecules that can bind to the surface.39
One should also keep in mind that, in DSSCs, the open circuit photovoltage (Voc) is given by the difference in the Fermi level of electrons in the metal oxide and the redox potential of the electrolyte. Therefore by tuning the chemical composition of the photoanode materials (by employing various metals and doping elements) it is possible to adapt the Fermi level of the semiconductor and to increase the Voc of the solar cells. These strategies based on the fine tuning of the electrode materials have initially sparked the strong interest of materials scientists for integrating electrospun components into photovoltaic devices.
3.1 Electrospun materials as photoanodes in DSSCs

3.1.1 TiO2 photoanodes prepared by electrospinning. 
Screen-printing coating of TiO2 NPs is the most popular and convenient technique to prepare the mesoporous thin films that are utilized as photoanodes in DSSCs. Typical TiO2 mesoporous layers show thickness in the range of 2–16 μm and are made of colloidal NPs with diameters of 15 to 40 nm. In most cases, the particles are prepared from controlled sol–gel hydrolysis of titanium alkoxides. In these layers the surface states influence strongly the photo-induced charge transfer that occurs between the sensitizer and the metal oxide and the connectivity between the particles greatly influences the transport of free electrons through the mesoporous nanoparticle network.
Recently one-dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanostructures such as nanotubes (NTs)40 or nanorods (NRs)41 have attracted interest for the fabrication of DSSCs with either liquid or quasi-solid-state electrolytes. Indeed, the devices based on the 1D nanostructures demonstrated higher photocurrent generation compared to conventional NP-based systems. This improvement was attributed to the reduced grain boundaries with 1D structures compared to those of the sintered NPs. One of the first examples of the use of the electrospinning technique for the preparation of photoanodes with 1D nanostructures was reported by Song et al. in 2004.42 In this pioneering work, the authors faced difficulties in ensuring the adhesion of the TiO2 NFs on the conductive glass. Adhesion of the NFs produced from electrospinning is a general problem and several strategies have been developed to solve it. In particular, Song et al. have pre-treated NFs prior to calcination with solvent vapour (THF) in order to partially melt the polymer matrix in which the inorganic precursors are embedded with the goal of promoting interconnection of the fibers. After heat treatment fibers made of anatase crystallites were formed and the TiO2 web electrodes maintained their porous structure and showed a better adhesion on the substrate. The resulting photoanodes were subsequently treated with TiCl4 that contributed to a dramatic increase of the current density up to 11.24 mA cm−2 and to boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 5% for the solar cells (Table 1).

Alternative to vapour exposure treatment, Onozuka et al. reinforced the adhesion between fibers and substrates by dipping for a short period the as-spun fibers in DMF which is a poor solvent for PVAc employed in this case as a sacrificial template.39 After the calcination step, the NFs made of anatase TiO2 crystallites, as revealed by XRD patterns, showed a good adhesion with the pre-deposited dense layer of TiO2. Different thicknesses of TiO2 fibers were investigated and the highest efficiency for the corresponding solar cells reached 4.14% for a 3.9 μm thick electrode. In addition to solvent treatments, more recently Du et al. demonstrated that the TiCl4 treatment also reinforces the strength and adhesion of the TiO2 NF films.43 Single-crystalline NRs of TiO2 have also been prepared from electrospun NFs and similar adhesion difficulties were encountered.41 Herein, alternative to solvent treatments, a mechanical hot-pressing step was employed to ensure the adhesion of the as-spun Ti precursor/PVAc composite fibers with the FTO. Upon this kind of treatment, each fibril gave rise to NRs which were converted to anatase single crystals after calcination. A DSSC was fabricated using these TiO2 NR electrodes sensitized with a ruthenium dye (N3) and a gel-based electrolyte (PVdF–HFP) was used instead of a liquid electrolyte. An efficient penetration of the highly viscous gel electrolyte into the TiO2 electrode was observed through large pores in the web. The well-aligned 1D TiO2 NRs and the good penetration of gel ensured a high Jsc of 14.77 mA cm−2 for the resulting quasi-solid-state solar cells leading to a rather good power conversion efficiency of 6.2% (Table 1).
While controlling finely this mechanical hot-pressing step, during the calcination process Hwang et al. were able to obtain a highly porous fiber-based photoanode with a large pore volume of circa 2.41 m3 g−1 and a large surface area of 112 m2 g−1.44 It was therefore appealing to use them in the quasi-solid state and solid-state DSSC configuration where the penetration of the hole transporting material is often problematic. Using these hierarchically structured TiO2 NFs with large pores, the efficiency of solar cells reached 6.54%. This improvement was attributed to a better pore filling by the plastic crystal-based solid-state electrolytes that lowered series resistance and improved charge collection (Table 1).
In 2009, the efficiency of electrospun TiO2 NR photoelectrodes was greatly improved to reach 9.52%.45 This impressive value is still the efficiency record for non-doped electrospun materials. The optimization in the sol–gel chemistry and the electrospinning process led to fibers consisting of NR structures with diameters of circa 15 nm and lengths of 60–100 nm. These NR fibers allowed the preparation of electrodes showing a higher active surface area and a larger pore volume than classical fibers. To increase further the surface area of the electrodes, Hwang et al. developed a template approach with SiO2 NPs.46 TiO2 NFs were fabricated by a simple electrospinning method starting from mixed solution containing the precursors together with colloidal SiO2. The etching step with an HF solution allowed us to create wormhole-like pores in the TiO2 NFs. These large pores facilitate electrolyte diffusion for oxidation reactions (regeneration of the dyes) and also contribute to a higher dye loading. Actually the surface area of these electrospun photoanodes was found to be nine times higher than the usual pristine TiO2-based photoanode. Following this strategy a rather high PCE of 8.50% was reached for the solar cells (Table 1). A similar approach was developed by Nair et al. but in this work the etching of SiO2 from the electrospun TiO2–SiO2 composite was carried out using NaOH. The performances of the resulting solar cells were slightly above 7% in this case (Table 1).47 To fabricate 1D mesoporous TiO2 NFs with wormhole-like pores, Lin et al. developed a simple electrospinning method combined with a sol–gel process in which they used a small fraction of room-temperature ionic liquid as the mesopore formation template.48 The porosity of the NFs was tuned by varying the amount of ionic liquid content in the feeding solution during the electrospinning process. The ionic liquid entrapped in the fibers was subsequently removed by washing it with anhydrous ethanol before their calcination. After this step, highly porous NFs with a surface area of up to 90 m2 g−1 were obtained. Using these NFs, an efficiency of up to 5.64% was reached compared to 3.75% without the use of ionic liquids (Table 1). As an alternative to ionic liquids, paraffin oil microemulsion droplets were also tested as the soft template for the preparation of electrospun NFs to form multiscale ultraporous NRs.49 TiO2 NRs with a composite structure of mesopores and macropores were prepared following this procedure. Subsequently, they were formulated as pastes and deposited by screen-printing. The efficiency of DSSCs based on these NRs as photonanodes was lower than the one of conventional NPs mainly because they showed a lower active surface area (Table 1). However when the material was employed as a scattering layer on top of NPs the conversion efficiency was enhanced up to 8.53%.
More commonly the template role is played directly by the polymers employed in the starting solution. Several groups have reported that when the polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) matrix is swapped to polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) or to a mixture of PVP and PVAc, the morphology of TiO2 varies from continuous fibers to rice-shaped50,51 and to leaf-shaped52 nanostructures. Indeed, the nature of the matrix has a strong impact on the structural characteristics of the final NFs such as surface area, crystallinity and shapes and ultimately it impacts the photovoltaic properties (Table 1).53 To increase the active surface area of NFs Koo et al. recently developed a co-electrospinning technique involving PVPs of different molecular weights.54 The TiO2 nanowires (NWs) prepared from different molecular weight fractions of PVP showed a higher surface area and a roughened aspect compared to NWs prepared from a single fraction (67.65 m2 g−1 against 23.93 m2 g−1). A clear effect on the dye loading was evidenced, but despite improving this parameter, the PCE of the corresponding solar cells remained below 4% (Table 1). Zhang et al. demonstrated that when two non-miscible polymers are employed such as PVP and polyethylene oxide (PEO) it is possible to obtain core–shell nanostructures (see Fig. 3) where TiO2–PVP blend covers a PEO core nanofiber.55 After calcination, hollow NFs were obtained with superior characteristics in terms of surface area and pore volume compared to the classical NFs. Devices fabricated with the hollow NFs exhibit higher Jsc and Voc due to higher dye loading and better electrolyte penetration in the mesopores of the films compared to conventional NFs. To synthesize similar hollow nanostructures Wang et al. developed a coaxial electrospinning procedure.56 Instead of PEO, paraffin oil was employed as a sacrificial template. A syringe containing paraffin oil was connected to the inner capillary of the spinneret containing the Ti precursor and PVP solution. After calcination, NTs with an inner diameter of circa 275 nm and a wall thickness of around 115 nm were obtained. These nanostructures showed an anatase-type crystalline phase. The device performances comprising them were limited (around 4.3%) because of a lower dye loading compared to a classical NP-based photoanode. Nevertheless this drawback was partially overcome by a faster electron transport in the NTs which improves charge collection and gives rise to a longer electron lifetime, leading to higher Voc.

Template-assisted synthesis was also demonstrated with an amphiphilic triblock copolymer as the structure directing agent.57 Using this strategy photoanodes with a surface area of 112 m2 g−1 and rather large pores, 6 ± 0.5 nm were fabricated. The large size of the pores enabled the use of P3HT as the hole transporting material. Solid state DSSCs were fabricated from the NFs synthesised with or without the template. In this work TiO2 was sensitized with an organic dye (D131) and the resulting PCE was 4 times higher compared to that of the mesoporous NFs prepared via the template-assisted method. The larger Jsc attained in this case was attributed to a higher dye loading and a better pore filling with the HTM (Table 1).
Apart from the composition of the initial Ti-precursor/polymer blend, the effect of critical parameters such as the feeding rate during the electrospinning process or temperature during the calcination step was investigated. It was clearly evidenced that the temperature of the calcination step plays a crucial role in the formation of different structures. This was illustrated by several teams and notably Kumar et al. who annealed their fibers prepared from the Ti precursor and PVAc at different temperatures ranging from 400 °C to 800 °C.58 Upon varying the growth conditions, pure anatase, mixed, and pure rutile TiO2 phases were obtained. The transformation of regular fibers into porous rod/hollow tube structures and into spindle network structures was influenced by polymer degradation and crystallite reformation processes. The variations of shape and crystallinity resulted in photovoltaic performances spanning from 0.79% to 4.56% (Table 1). The critical effect of the calcination temperature was also highlighted by Lin et al. who developed a template-free alkali hydrothermal route to synthesize NFs.59 A prickle-like structure was formed by controlling precisely the parameters of the calcination step. When this step is performed at 150 °C for 12 h prickle-like branches grow off the TiO2 nanofiber backbone leading to a significantly larger surface area (154 m2 g−1) than conventional fibers (36 m2 g−1). After optimization of the device fabrication, a PCE of circa 7.9% was achieved using the prickle-like nanostructures. The influence of the feeding rate during the electrospinning process was investigated as well. Mali et al. prepared NFs with different diameters by varying the feeding rate during the deposition.60 At a low feeding rate i.e. 1.0 mL h−1, thin fibers (296 nm wide) were formed whereas for a higher feeding rate i.e. 2.5 mL h−1 wider fibers (639 nm wide) were obtained. Bigger fibers do not necessarily lead to a greater active surface area as it was evidenced in this work. Indeed the NFs deposited at 1.5 mL h−1 (421 nm) showed the highest efficiency of 5.39%, and this performance was attributed to a higher dye loading related to a higher surface area (147.8 m2 g−1) (Table 1).
After analysing in detail the literature, it turns out that NFs offer better charge transport properties but the device performances remain very often lower than the ones obtained for devices based on NPs. Several groups tried to take advantage of both nanostructures by combining NPs and NFs. In 2008, Chuangchote et al. electrospun NF layers of 1 μm thick on top of a TiO2 NP-based photoanode.61 The Jsc of the NF-containing cells was found to be higher compared to the ones containing solely NPs (Table 1). The authors attributed this effect to improved charge transport properties in these electrodes but also to a light scattering effect originating from the NF layer. Similar properties were observed by Lee et al. who used different thicknesses of electrospun NFs on top of NPs (Table 1).62 With the same philosophy, Zhu et al. prepared nest-shaped NPs by electrospinning to act as a scattering layer (Fig. 4).63 The photocurrent of DSSCs containing the nest-shaped NPs was relatively high due to the improvement of light harvesting and lower electron transfer resistance (Table 1). This resulted in a relatively high efficiency of 8.02%.

Joshi et al. proposed a different strategy and synthesized a nanoparticle (NP)/nanofiber (NF) composite by dispersing various amounts of electrospun NFs in conventional TiO2 NPs.64 Their study revealed that the presence of electrospun TiO2 NFs noticeably improves the management of light in the active layer through the scattering effect without substantially sacrificing the dye uptake. A PCE of 8.8% was obtained with such electrodes. The (1D) assembly of TiO2 NPs was also investigated as a scattering layer. Indeed Gao et al. prepared a blend of conventional TiO2 NPs and PVP dispersed in ethanol and used it as an electrospinning precursor solution. Their work showed that the 1D assembly of NPs can enhance simultaneously electron transport and light scattering (Table 1).65 A similar effect was recently demonstrated using electrospun TiO2 NRs constituted of NPs.66,67 To take advantage of light scattering and of a large surface area, Yang et al. prepared photoanodes consisting of two layers of electrospun TiO2 NFs showing different diameters, respectively, 60 and 100 nm.68 For this device architecture, it was demonstrated that the smaller-diameter nanofiber layer with a large surface can adsorb a large quantity of dyes. As a result this layer efficiently harvests sunlight and transports photo-generated electrons; on the other hand the bigger-diameter nanofiber layer reflects and traps sunlight in the photoanode. The PCE of this type of DSSC can be increased up to 8.4%.
The scattering effect of electrospun materials revealing various shapes was investigated in detail by Zhu et al. who synthesized and compared rice grain- or nanofiber-shaped TiO2.69 Both types of nanomaterials showed a similar diameter and surface area.
To compare their scattering ability, a 2 μm thick layer of these materials was deposited on top of a 10 μm thick layer of conventional TiO2 NPs. Photovoltaic parameters of the devices showed that the both Jsc and Voc of the rice-grain shape TiO2-based device were higher (Table 1). The enhancement of Jsc was attributed to a better light scattering effect while the improvement of Voc was attributed to reduced grain boundaries leading to a lower recombination rate. These features are particularly interesting for increasing the Jsc in solar cells. Several groups have demonstrated that 1D nanostructures generally show reduced grain boundaries that play an important role in the recombination processes allowing them to improve simultaneously Jsc and Voc.
This brief overview illustrates that electrospinning can lead to a large structural diversity of TiO2 nanostructures by simply tuning the chemical composition of the precursor solution or relevant processing parameters such as the calcination temperature or the mechanical hot-pressing. Electrospun TiO2 materials can be deposited directly on the substrates, or they can be formulated as printable pastes.70 Moreover, following appropriate procedures, they can even be vertically aligned perpendicular to the substrate.71


3.1.2 Electrospun TiO2 doped or coated with metals. 
Another strong advantage of electrospinning relies on the possibility to tune very easily the chemical structure and the crystallinity of the final nanostructures by simply adjusting the composition of the precursor's solution (polymer matrix and metal precursor components). Complex chemical compositions including various nanostructures can be obtained. Examples of such heterostructures include TiO2–Al2O3 NFs or TiO2 doped with various metals.72–75 An interesting approach in photovoltaics consists of using Au or Ag nanostructures in the photo-active layer in order to take benefit of the surface plasmonic effect to enhance absorption.
Naphade et al. explored this concept and prepared electrospun NFs from titanium and gold precursors mixed in PVP.73 After the calcination step the presence of tiny Au NPs dispersed uniformly in the semiconducting oxide matrix was evidenced by TEM and EDX analysis. The Au content was close to 1 wt% in the TiO2 NFs and the size of the NPs was in the range of 5 to 10 nm (Fig. 5). Those Au-doped TiO2 NFs were used in the scattering layer of a DSSC device. It was shown that Au loaded fibers help improving mainly the current density and the fill factor of the devices. This was attributed to the better light harvesting properties of the doped fibers tentatively attributed to plasmon–polariton modes and to a lower charge recombination attributed to nanoscale Schottky junctions in the NFs. PCE close to 7.8% was achieved with these materials (Table 2).

Alternatively, Archana et al. doped TiO2 NFs with Niobium.76 In this case Nb was directly incorporated into the metal oxide lattice. The primary effect was a decrease in grain size within the doped-NFs compared to the non-doped ones. It was found that the active surface area was also reduced, impacting negatively the amount of dye loaded on the doped electrodes. However, surprisingly the Jsc of DSSCs with the Nb-doped TiO2 photoanode was found to be higher compared to the reference device (Table 2). This phenomenon was attributed to a higher concentration of additional charges induced by the Nb doping. Unfortunately a higher rate of recombination (originating from the smaller grain size) between the photoanode and the electrolyte was also observed leading to average performances of around 4.7%. The same authors investigated nickel doping of TiO2 NFs by electrospinning titanium(IV) isopropoxide and nickel sulfate hexahydrate with PVAc. After calcination, NWs of Ni-doped TiO2 showing a diameter of 60 nm and a specific surface area of circa 80 m2 g−1 were obtained. The fibers contained up to 5% Ni atoms and this amount was sufficient to shift the band gap of the Ni doped TiO2 toward the visible region.77 Once incorporated into devices the fibers with 2% Ni showed high Voc (881 mV) related to their higher flat-band, and a rather high Jsc (12.01 mA cm−2), resulting in a PCE of 6.75% (Table 2). Ni-doped TiO2 with higher content of Ni revealed lower PCE mainly because these NFs showed mixture phases of rutile and anatase in their structure.
Finally Archana et al. have performed the synthesis of tungsten-doped TiO2 (W-TiO2) NWs by electrospinning and have evaluated their performance in DSSCs.78 Similarity in the ionic radii between W6+ and Ti4+ and availability of two free electrons per dopant were the justification for this study. Tungsten hexachloride was used as the source of W in the electrospun materials. The results showed that W-doping first hindered the grain growth leading to a larger available surface for grafting dyes, and second increased the electron lifetime on account of increased electron density. The NWs containing only 2 at% W-TiO2 gave 90% higher Jsc (15.39 mA cm2) compared to non-doped materials and the PCE of the best device was close to 9%.
Alternative to elemental doping with metals, electrospun TiO2 nanofibers can be coated by metal nanoparticles to provide efficient photoanodes.
This approach is quite popular in photocatalysis79 but only a few examples have been reported for solar cell applications. In 2011, Shi and coworkers prepared silver nanoparticle coated TiO2 nanofibers by incorporating silver nitrate (AgNO3) during the electrospinning process. After the calcination step, AgNO3 decomposes to form Ag nanoparticles homogeneously distributed in the fiber mat. This resulted in a significant increase of photocurrent density compared to pristine solar cells. The improvement was attributed to a better light harvesting efficiency due to the plasmon enhanced optical absorption induced by Ag nanoparticles, and to an improved electron collection efficiency resulting from faster electron transport in the Ag doped TiO2 nanofiber photoanode.80 More recently silver-decorated porous TiO2 nanofibers were made by simple electrospinning, etching, and chemical reduction processes. The Ag NPs were well dispersed on the TiO2 surface and in the photoanode film after heat treatment. The Ag NPs exhibited light scattering and plasmonic effects, thus leading to improved light absorption at visible wavelengths. Consequently, the PCE of the DSSCs was improved from 6.2% to 8.8% relative to pure TiO2 NFs.81 Owing to the large development of electrospun nanofibers coated by metal nanoparticles for catalysis, it appears that further improvements can be expected by implementing these materials as photoanodes in DSSCs.


3.1.3 Electrospun TiO2 doped with carbon materials. 
Over the past few years carbon-based materials such as graphene and nanotubes (NTs) have emerged as valuable components for (opto)electronic applications thanks to their unique semi-conducting properties and their robustness. Several research groups have employed them to prepare blends via the electrospinning process with TiO2. In 2012, Madhavan et al. prepared electrospun TiO2–graphene composite NFs.82 The presence of the graphene phase in the NFs was clearly evidenced using Raman spectroscopy and TEM. In order to maintain consistency and stability for the NFs the amount of graphene was voluntarily limited to 1 wt%. Tests with higher contents resulted in stress and breakage of the fibers during the calcination step because of the mismatch between coefficients of thermal expansion of the two materials. One benefit of the incorporation of graphene was the reduced recombination rate of photo-induced electrons and holes in TiO2 composite NFs. As a consequence a rather good PCE of 7.6% was obtained with graphene-loaded electrodes, which is higher than the PCE of 6.3% measured with pristine TiO2 NFs used as reference materials in this study (Table 2).
Similar observations, i.e. annihilation of the electron–hole recombination processes in solar cells, were reported by Motlak et al. for graphene oxide-doped TiO2 NFs.83 However the performances of the DSSCs based on this material remained low (Table 2). To improve the performances the authors performed additional doping of the TiO2 graphene oxide photoanode with nitrogen.84 Nitrogen doping was found to produce new electronic states, narrowing the band gap and greatly improving the electron transport in TiO2 NF films, thereby reducing the charge recombination rate of photon-generated electrons.
Apart from graphene derivatives, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were also employed to tune the electronic properties of electrospun materials. For example, TiO2 NFs or NRs with embedded multiwall carbon nanotubes were synthesized.85,86 In the case of composites with NRs of TiO2, the doping rate, ranging from 0.05 to 0.15 wt%, was simply controlled by adjusting the amount of nanotubes in the mother solution. Similar to graphene, it was established that carbon nanotubes can significantly reduce the recombination process. Besides, they can actively participate in the collection and transport of photo-generated electrons to the electrode. A very low amount of CNTs of 0.1 wt% was found to be optimum to reach high efficiency in solar cells (Table 2), and higher concentration leads to a dramatic drop in the measured Jsc. This phenomenon was explained by a lower absorption of the dyes when large amounts of CNTs are used because sensitizers cannot anchor to the surface of CNTs. After optimization of the device fabrication, PCE reached 10.24% which is the highest reported for a DSSC using an electrospun photoanode (Fig. 6 and Table 2).86

3.1.4 Alternative metal oxides for the electrospun photoanode. 
Despite the fact that the record efficiencies of DSSCs are obtained using nanostructures made of TiO2, other metal oxides have been successfully implemented as photo-electrodes in DSSCs87 such as SnO2,88,89 Nb2O5,90,91 In2O392 and ZnO.93 For instance, some of these materials possess good chemical stability and they exhibit electron mobility in the bulk that is 1 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than the one of TiO2.94–96 For this reason, some research teams have undertaken studies devoted to replacing TiO2 by other types of metal oxide semiconductors.87 Among the large variety of binary metal oxides ZnO appears to be a particularly interesting alternative material, and indeed using ZnO NPs, power conversion efficiencies up to 7.5% have been reported.93,97,98 ZnO is a wide-bandgap metal oxide that usually crystallizes in the hexagonal wurtzite phase. The conduction band edges of ZnO and TiO2 are close (around −4.3 eV versus vacuum level) but the former shows significantly enhanced electron mobility in the bulk (200–300 cm2 V−1 s−1) than the latter (0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1).99,100
Moreover this material can also be prepared by electrospinning following pretty much the same procedures developed for TiO2. The first example of electrospun ZnO NFs used as a photoanode was reported by Kim et al. in 2007.101 ZnO fibers were prepared from a DMF solution containing a Zn-precursor and PVAc. After hot-pressing and calcination steps, fibers with grain size averaging 36 nm and showing the expected wurtzite type phase were obtained. The small surface area of the ZnO nanomaterials (around 24 m2 g−1) was the limiting factor in this work, preventing the authors to obtain high Jsc values for the solar cells and consequently a low PCE of 1.34% was reported (Table 3). In 2009, Zhang et al. tried to optimize this approach by preparing electrospun ZnO fiber electrodes with various thicknesses varying from 1.5 μm to 5.0 μm.102 Due to the mismatch between the thermal expansion coefficient of the glass substrate and ZnO, some cracks in the layer occur after calcination steps (Fig. 7(a) and (b)). In order to prevent the film from such defects and to promote the adhesion of the fibers onto the FTO substrate the authors investigated the spontaneous formation of a buffer layer. They employed a Zn(OAc)2 surface treatment prior to the deposition to form a dense layer that acts as a “self-relaxation layer” (Fig. 7(c)). After the calcination step, the active area of the ZnO NFs was 30 m2 g−1. DSSCs were fabricated with N719 as a sensitizer and the power conversion efficiency of such cells was improved to 3% (Table 3). This enhancement was explained by higher Jsc compared to previous studies, originating from a slightly larger surface area and the suppression of recombination processes between the electrode and the electrolyte as confirmed by impedance spectroscopy measurements.

Later, with the objective to boost the light harvesting efficiency of ZnO NW-based electrodes, 3D architectures were developed by McCune and co-workers.103 In their work a specific electrospinning process was set up to grow a 3D multilayered ZnO NW array with a caterpillar-like structure. Practically, the 3D structure was obtained by layer-by-layer growth based on electrospinning. ZnO NFs are prepared on top of previously grown NWs that serve as seeding layers for the growth of the next generation of NWs. As a consequence the last layer of ZnO NWs grow upward, in a 360° fashion, along the entire length of the NFs, leading to multidimensional nanostructures (Fig. 8). After the third deposition step, the morphology changes from the layer on top of each other to a caterpillar-like structure that owns extremely high density of NWs (between 8 × 1010 and 1 × 1011 cm−2) with a small diameter (∼50 nm). This unique nanostructure significantly enhances the surface area of the ZnO arrays, leading to higher short-circuit currents in solar cells. Additionally, this design resulted in closer spacing between the NWs and more direct conduction pathways for electron transfer. Thus, the open-circuit voltage was significantly improved as a direct result of the reduction in electron recombination. A PCE as high as 5.2% was achieved, which is among the highest reported values to date for ZnO nanowire-based DSSCs.

In 2015, Song et al. also developed ZnO electrospun photoanodes constituted by mixtures of NPs and NWs leading to a PCE close to 2.6%.104 They intended to improve these performances by incorporating CNTs into their NP–NW blends and they reached 3.8% after treating the final electrodes with TiCl4. Electrospinning was also employed to blend ZnO with TiO2 and graphene following the procedure initially developed by Madhavan et al.82,105 Mixing ZnO with TiO2 was motivated by the fact that the conduction band of TiO2 is located at −4.2 eV whereas that of ZnO is slightly lower in energy −4.3 eV. This difference can be beneficial to increase the lifetime of the electrons by promoting electron transfer from the TiO2 conduction band to that of the ZnO. Graphene was investigated in this work as a separation layer. Its role was to favour the separation of the photo-induced excitons and preventing their recombination thanks to the band bending that occurs at the interface with the ZnO–TiO2 blend. The use of ZnO–TiO2 blend as a photoanode yielded a PCE of 2.7% whereas upon employing the graphene doped blend, the PCE reached 3.7% (Table 3). Co-axial electrospinning techniques initially developed for the formation of a TiO2 hollow structure were implemented by Du et al. to form NFs consisting of a TiO2 core surrounded by a ZnO sheath.106 This strategy was successful and led to the effective suppression of some recombination processes that yielded a PCE of 5.2%.
Apart from ZnO, tin oxide (SnO2) is also identified as a useful transparent conducting oxide for nanoelectronics due to its high electron mobility in bulk (10–125 cm2 V−1 s−1) and its wider band gap (circa 3.6 eV). Krishnamoorthy et al. extended the technique they developed to form vertically aligned TiO2 NFs to SnO2.71,107 They demonstrated a large-scale production of aligned SnO2 NFs using a multi-nozzle electrospinning method combined with an air-shield enclosed rotating drum collector. The height and the diameter of the NWs were 19 ± 2 μm and 75 ± 25 nm, respectively, and XRD patterns revealed that the SnO2 NWs are polycrystalline rutile structures. DSSCs using this nanostructured material as a photoanode gave a short-circuit Jsc of 9.9 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.525 V and a PCE of 2.53% (Table 3). These results were comparable to DSSCs consisting of randomly aligned NWs produced by hydrothermal synthesis, or thick mesoporous SnO2 NPs.108 The rather low Voc usually observed for DSSCs fabricated with a SnO2 photoanode (typically below 600 mV) is due to the position of its conduction band which is located at a lower energy level compared with TiO2. Kumar et al. explored further the versatility of electrospinning by precisely controlling the precursor concentration (anhydrous tin(II) chloride) in the polymeric solution (DMF–ethanol–PVAc) to obtain either fibers or flower shaped nanostructures of SnO2.109 The nanoflowers were made of nanofibrils with diameters ranging from 70 to 100 nm, which in turn consisted of linear arrays of single crystalline NPs of 20 to 30 nm size (Fig. 9). XPS and XRD analysis of the nanostructures showed that both nanoflowers and NFs have the same chemical composition and show the same cassiterite phase, however the nanoflowers revealed a superior crystallinity. DSSCs were fabricated using the different materials, highlighting the better performances of the nanoflower-based device in which PCE reached 3% (Table 3).

Surprisingly the Voc of the solar cells was impressively high for a SnO2-based device at 0.7 V. This was tentatively explained by a faster charge collection in the nanoflower structures due to their superior crystallinity, allowing us to suppress significantly the surface defects and interfacial recombination processes between the semiconductor and the electrolyte.
In order to solve the Voc issue usually observed with SnO2 photoanodes while keeping their transport ability, Gao et al. developed SnO2 nanotubes and SnO2–TiO2 core–shell NFs.110 Nanotubes were obtained starting from precursor solutions with lower concentration compared to the ones that usually lead to NFs. It was hypothesized that upon heating, the diluted SnCl2 precursors dispersed in the PVP solution tend to diffuse to the surface of the NFs and to decompose to form SnO2 NPs whereas using the more concentrated solutions, fibers are formed after decomposing the precursors without any migration. This formation mechanism of SnO2 hollow structures was also investigated by other teams who proposed complementary interpretations.111,112 Coating of TiO2 on SnO2 NFs and nanotubes was performed by dipping the SnO2 NFs and nanotube electrodes into a TiCl4 aqueous solution followed by sintering. XRD analysis showed that both SnO2 and TiO2 were in a rutile phase. The surface area was increased from circa 39 m2 g−1 to 52 m2 g−1 after coating with TiO2 the SnO2 nanotubes.
The devices using the bare and coated NFs and nanotubes show that the Voc and Jsc of the coated photoanode are considerably higher than those obtained with the bare ones (Table 3). These results were expected because the conduction-band edge of SnO2 is 300 mV more positive than that of TiO2, which leads to a faster interfacial electron recombination and lower trapping density. Therefore, the significant increase in Voc and Jsc indicates that the interfacial electron combinations in SnO2 NF and nanotube photoanodes are effectively suppressed by coating them with TiO2. Gao et al. recently developed a new procedure to tune the architecture of the SnO2–TiO2 NFs.113 They managed to grow TiO2 needles at the surface of the NFs from a TiCl3 solution heated at 75 °C. High Jsc (20.5 mA cm−2) was achieved with this new architecture that was attributed to a lower charge recombination and a faster electron transport.
In 2013 Ahn et al. used a similar approach to cover the SnO2 nanotubes with TiO2 nanosheets grown via hydrothermal reaction (Fig. 10).110,114 These nanotubes were dispersed in mesoporous TiO2 films. The coated nanotubes exhibit a superior light harvesting efficiency originating from a better light scattering ability.

These photoanodes also show a bimodal porosity consisting of small and big pores that enable the good penetration of the electrolyte making them suitable for quasi-solid state DSSCs. SnO2–TiO2 coated nanotubes showed better efficiency, reaching 7.7% with electrodes containing 10 wt% of coated nanotubes.
In 2010 Wu et al. developed a scattering layer of SnO2 and ZnO on top of a ZnO NW-based photoanode.115 The electrospun PVP-hosted SnO2/ZnO NFs were swollen using methanol vapor followed by high-temperature calcination at 600 °C to form a layer composed of SnO2 and ZnO nanocrystals with a diameter of ∼10 nm. The NFs of ZnO and SnO2 were also obtained without vapor treatment. Jsc, Voc, and FF of the devices fabricated with this type of scattering layer are enhanced compared to pristine ones. IPCE spectra and IMPS results show that the dye-sensitized SnO2–ZnO films do not contribute directly to the generation of photocurrent, and the enhancement of Jsc can mainly be attributed to the reflection of photons back into the nanowire photoanode. Lately some teams have reported the use of electrospun In2O3 as a photoanode for DSSCs but its efficiency was limited below 0.5%.116,117 To improve these results, in 2015, Miao et al. attempted to use electrospinning methods for the synthesis of indium oxide nanotubes doped with rare earth elements such dysprosium, holmium and erbium.118 The structural analysis of these new photoanodes confirmed that the different rare earth elements were incorporated into the cubic crystal lattice of In2O3. The band gap of the doped indium oxide photoanode was slightly larger due to charge transfer transition between these ions and indium oxide conduction bands and also to the formation of localized band edges at the doped sites in the In2O3 lattice. DSSCs based on these doped photoanodes show better performances than the undoped ones. Doping with erbium gave the best result with a PCE of 1.4% compared to 0.5% obtained with undoped In2O3 (Table 3).
Besides the simple binary metal oxides, ternary metal oxides have also been considered as photoelectrode materials in DSSCs. In contrast, electrospinning of multication oxides has been rarely explored. In comparison with simple binary oxides, multication oxides show more possibilities to tune the materials' chemical and physical properties by altering the compositions. By varying the relative element ratio, the band gap energy, the work function, and the electric resistivity of the ternary oxides can be readily tuned. Considering the availability of a wide range of multication oxides and their tuneable properties, it is therefore interesting to investigate their applications in DSSCs and for their preparation electrospinning appears as a particularly well-adapted method. Up to now, electrospun ternary oxides such as SrTiO3 fibers119–121 have been principally investigated for photo-catalysis and only a few articles have focused on electrospun Zn2SnO4 nanomaterials for photovoltaic applications.122–125 The main motivation in developing nanostructures made of Zn2SnO4 relies on its lower sensitivity to acidic conditions compared to ZnO and its higher electron mobility in bulk compared to TiO2. In 2013, Choi et al. prepared electrospun Zn2SnO4 photoanodes that were sensitized with N719 and also organic dyes.126 The Zn2SnO4 photoanodes were prepared by electrospinning of a mother solution made of Zn(OAc)2, Sn(OAc)4 and PVAc, followed by a hot-pressing step to ensure the adhesion to the FTO surface that partially melts the PVAc onto the FTO before a calcination step. Calcination at 450 °C gives porous and smooth amorphous NFs as confirmed by TEM and X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. 11). The specific surface area for this NF network was found to be 124 m2 g−1, which is similar to conventional TiO2 NP electrodes. The results obtained using organic and organometallic sensitizers clearly showed that Zn2SnO4 photoanodes gave better performances when they are combined with organic sensitizers. Power conversion efficiency with organic dyes leads to a PCE up to 3.7% whereas the PCE with N719 was limited to 1.4% for similar photoanode thicknesses (3 μm) (Table 3). The better efficiency with organic dyes originated from much higher Jsc attributed to a better dye loading and their higher extinction molar coefficient compared to N719. This work paved the way for further improvements. Indeed, recently, hierarchically structured Zn2SnO4 beads synthesised by the hydrothermal method and deposited by the electrospray technique have demonstrated a PCE of 6.3%.127

3.2 Electrospun materials as electrolytes in DSSCs
We have seen previously that electrospun NFs and mats are nowadays increasingly being investigated for the development of photoanode materials, where nanoscale features such as high aspect ratios and large surface areas combined with high pore volume allow improvements of the performances of solar cells. However electrospinning is such a powerful technique that it can also be applied for the processing of other key elements in DSSCs such as electrolytes and counter electrodes. For the real use of DSSCs and future applications in BIPV for instance, in addition to high PCEs, a long device lifetime is required. Because of this requirement, highly volatile electrolytes, such as acetonitrile-based ones, have to be replaced because they are inappropriate for achieving high stability.
One of the clearly identified problems in employing them is the difficulty in achieving a robust seal, and their tendency to evaporate and leak. Many research groups have been searching for alternatives to liquid electrolytes, such as inorganic or organic hole conductors, ionic liquids, and gel electrolytes. In particular, polymer gel electrolytes have attracted interest due to their appealing properties such as thermal stability, non-flammability, small vapour pressure, good pore filling properties and high ionic conductivity, which are achieved by trapping a liquid electrolyte in polymer cages formed in a host matrix. A wide variety of polymers have already been employed and studied over the years such as poly(acrylonitrile),128 poly(ethyleneglycol),129 poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),130 and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF–HFP)131 to name a few. So far PVdF–HFP looks to be the most promising system due to its high ionic conductivities at room temperature and its stability and compatibility with the TiO2 photoanode and the Pt counter electrode.
In 2008, Priya et al. investigated a method to process polymer gel electrolytes via electrospinning to generate a fibrous membrane of PVdF–HFP.132 The membrane was prepared from a 16 wt% solution of PVdF–HFP in a mixture of acetone/N,N-dimethylacetamide at 80 °C. The resulting membrane thickness was reduced from 30 to 15 μm after a drying step followed by a hot-pressing step. The average length of the NFs was estimated to be 600 nm while the ionic conductivity of the membrane was measured at circa 1 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 °C (Table 4). To fabricate the DSSC, the membrane was simply sandwiched between the sensitized photoanode (sensitizer N719) and the counter electrode and the cell was filled with the iodine electrolyte before being thermally sealed. Photovoltaic measurements showed that the final device exhibits higher Voc but lower Jsc than the reference device containing solely a liquid electrolyte. The reduction in the back electron transfer from the TiO2 CB to the I3− ions because of a lower concentration of I3− species in the electrolyte near the mesoporous TiO2 was hypothesised to explain the enhancement of the Voc value. Unfortunately this phenomenon is also detrimental to the Jsc, and because of lower ionic conductivity, the dye regeneration kinetic is not as fast as in liquid cells. The photoconversion efficiency was lower compared to the liquid device but the cells demonstrated higher fatigue resistance. Indeed the PVdF–HFP based device retained 96% of its efficiency after two weeks (compared to 85% for reference devices). Later Ahn et al. further enhanced the performances of PVdF–HFP-based devices by developing a new system composed of liquid crystal embedded polymer electrolytes.133 The role of the liquid crystal was to act as a plasticizer. As a result ionic conductivity was enhanced in the presence of this additive and reached values close to the ones observed with the standard liquid electrolyte (Table 4). The quasi solid-state DSSC fabricated from electrospun fibers comprising the additive reached a maximum PCE of 6.82%. With the same philosophy, i.e. boosting the ionic conductivity by means of additives, Vijayakumar et al. have developed PVdF–HFP layers with various amounts of cobalt sulphide (CoS) using the electrospinning technique.134 Nanocomposite membranes were activated by an ionic liquid electrolyte. The authors found that, even with a limited amount (up to 3 wt%) of CoS NPs uniformly dispersed in the matrix, the charge transport was increased and that the diffusion of the redox couple in the electrolyte system was facilitated. The photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs assembled using this new material was found to be 7.34%. It is worth noting that the incorporation of the CoS NPs is not detrimental to the stability of the cells. The same team also studied the swelling of PVdF–HFP electrospun fibers using an ionic liquid electrolyte giving a power conversion efficiency of 6.42% and an excellent stability over more than 30 days.135 Following the same approach polyaniline (PANI) was mixed into the PVdF–HFP membrane.136 PANI facilitates electrical conduction and ultimately accelerates redox reaction kinetics. As a result the power conversion efficiency was improved from 6.42% for pristine layers to 7.20% with 3 wt% of PANI in the PVdF–HFP matrix.

Lately, Sethupathy et al. electrospun another type of blend based on poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-polyacrylonitrile) (PVdF–PAN) and Fe2O3 NPs.137 Similar to CoS in composites with PVdF–HFP, Fe2O3 NPs increased ionic conductivity in the deposited layer, but the PCE of the devices was limited to 4.90% in this case (Table 4).
3.3 Electrospun materials as counter electrodes in DSSCs
Platinum counter electrodes have been widely used in DSSCs, because platinum is an efficient electro-catalyst for the reduction of I3− ions.138 Nowadays, platinum still appears as a reference system in this field but this metal is also known for being an expensive element that prevents further massive developments at the industrial level. Besides, side reactions (such as oxidation and complex formation) with the corrosive I−/I3− redox couple can reduce its catalytic activity, which can jeopardize the long-term stability of DSSCs.139,140 For the above mentioned reasons it comes out highly desirable to replace this component in DSSCs or to significantly diminish the quantity of Pt necessary to fabricate them. The first example of electrospun Pt-free counter-electrodes was published in 2010.141 In this work Platinum was replaced by carbon NFs synthesized according to the following process: in the first step, NFs were simply prepared from a DMF–poly(acrylonitrile) solution that was electrospun using standard conditions, and then the fibers were collected and subsequently heated at 1200 °C to give rise to the formation of carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Those fibers were then dispersed into poly(oxyethylene-tridecylether) and printed using a doctor-blade onto a FTO glass substrate. Processing the NFs by blending them with a polymer matrix appeared mandatory since alone they could not provide strong enough attachment to the FTO surface.
When processed into a paste, the NFs, which were originally tens of micrometers long, were broken into sub-micrometers to micrometers. That impacted the conductivity which was one order of magnitude lower (1538 S m−1 to 164 S m−1). Photovoltaic performances of the Pt-free electrodes (PCE of 5.5%) were slightly lower than the reference Pt-based counter-electrode, mainly originating from an increase of the total series resistance of the device. With the goal of maintaining the efficiency for the regeneration process of the redox species and significantly reducing the quantity of Pt used in the counter electrodes, Pt NPs were incorporated into electrospun carbon fibers (CNFs). In this study, the CNFs were prepared by electrospinning polyacrylonitrile nanofibers followed by thermal treatments of stabilization and carbonization. Then, crushed CNFs were soaked into a Pt precursor solution and heated at 400 °C. The CNF–Pt composites were then mixed with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and sodium salt in deionized water was added as a binder to give a printable paste. That paste was applied onto the FTO coated glass substrate by doctor blading. Using this material, the total resistance of the DSSC decreases and the devices with a CNF–Pt-based counter electrode exhibit a PCE of 8%.142 These authors also developed electrospun nano-belts consisting of overlaid TiC/C composite NFs where the surface was decorated with Pt NPs.143 This approach led to Pt counter-electrodes where the quantity of Pt was 10 times inferior compared to conventional devices. Their catalytic activity was good enough to reach a PCE of circa 7.2%, but this was not sufficient to outperform the above-mentioned performances. More recently, Elbohy et al. integrated graphene nano-platelets into electrospun CNFs and they subsequently grown Pt nano-needles onto the CNF surface through a redox reaction between H2PtCl6 and HCOOH.144 Synergistic effects of graphene integration and Pt nano-needle decoration on DSSC performance were observed. They were attributed to higher electro-catalytic performance due to the larger interfacial area, faster I3− reduction rate, lower charge transfer resistance, and lower series resistance for electron transport. Overall this yielded a PCE of 9.77% (Table 5).

In order to get rid of platinum, nickel is a plausible alternative. However to reach respectable efficiency it has to be either nitride,145 embedded in graphene as nickel phosphide146 or processed as a nanoparticle.147 Joshi et al. followed the last strategy and produced a counter electrode from nickel NPs embedded in carbon nanotubes and NFs.148 To form the nickel-embedded CNT-coated electrospun NFs, poly(acrylonitrile) and Ni(AcAc)2 were dissolved in DMF and then the precursor solution was electrospun. The NFs were then annealed in a mixed H2 and argon flow to reduce Ni2+ to the Ni atom. This forces the aggregation of Ni at the NF surface to form catalytic NPs. Following that step, NFs were fully carbonized before growing nanotubes by introducing a flow of argon and ethylene. The resulting materials were then crushed, mixed with carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt to give a paste that can be deposited by doctor blading onto a FTO glass substrate to give the counter electrode. The new counter electrode was roughly half the thickness of the reference electrode but it revealed greater porosity and surface area and therefore better catalytic activity. Despite being lower, the DSSC performances with Ni-based electrodes were very close to the ones of Pt-based devices (7.96% versus 8.32%) (Table 5). In 2015, Saranya et al. swapped from Ni NPs to a bimetallic Fe–Ni system and followed the electrospinning procedure.149 They were able to attain the equivalent electrochemical parameters to the Pt-based counter-electrode with this new material and reported very close photovoltaic efficiencies (Table 5). Mohamed et al. selected (Co–Cr) NPs to be embedded into CNFs to boost their electro-catalytic activity.150 However, their approach was not fully successful as the performances were lower. Therefore they replaced Cr in their material by Ni and they achieved slightly better performances close to 4.5% (Table 5).151
Conducting polymers were also considered for developing original Pt-free counter electrode materials. In 2012, Peng et al. used electrospun conductive polyaniline–polylactic acid (PLA) composite NFs for the fabrication of rigid and flexible devices.152 PLA was necessary to increase the viscosity and surface tension of the solution to form NFs during electrospinning, and PANI was doped with camphor sulfonic acid (CSA) to make it more conductive. One strong advantage of this approach is the absence of the annealing process to form the electrode. The as-spun PANI–CSA–PLA NFs are stacked and bonded with the substrate firmly, immediately after deposition resulting in an interconnected nanofibrous network (Fig. 12). A quite promising PCE of 5.3% was obtained for the devices containing the PANI–CSA–PLA counter-electrode. Because the annealing step is not necessary with this kind of material, the process is fully compatible with flexible substrates, and the authors demonstrated its applicability on polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) (Table 5).

In 2013 Kim et al. developed platinum NFs in order to get rid of the FTO that is used in the counter electrode.153 The electrospinning process allowed the authors to prepare Pt NFs from a PVP solution containing the Pt source (H2PtCl6·6H2O) and thermal annealing was employed to decompose the PVP and reduce the precursor to give pure metallic Pt. By controlling the electrospinning time it is possible to control the NF density on the bare glass substrate onto which they are deposited. The NF density clearly impacts the sheet conductance and the charge transfer resistance. The benefits of this approach were limited as Pt is still used to fabricate the electrodes and the PCE remains moderate (Table 5). In 2015, Zhou et al. reported a similar approach to form Pt NW mats as counter electrodes that were used in flexible cells.154 Even if the electrocatalytic behaviour of those Pt counter electrodes was found to be similar to conventional Pt/FTO counter electrodes the photovoltaic performances were relatively poor (3.82%). Kesterite is another class of materials that was recently investigated as a counter-electrode in DSSCs. Indeed, Mali et al. have successfully synthesized PVP- and CA (cellulose acetate)-assisted Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) NFs via an electrospinning technique.
Surface morphology reveals that the PVP-assisted CZTS NFs have a smooth surface and that the diameters of the fibers can be adjusted from 100–150 nm to 10–20 nm diameters just by swapping from the PVP to CA matrix. The XRD and TEM results revealed that the PVP-assisted CZTS NFs are single kesterite crystalline, whereas CA-assisted CZTS NFs are kesterite polycrystalline in nature. Promising performances of solar cells close to 3.9% were obtained with these Pt-free electrodes.155
3.4 Electrospun materials for flexible DSSCs
The integration of electronic devices into everyday objects that are non-planar and foldable can open new areas of applications. Therefore flexible electronics have been extensively investigated in the last decade for displays, thin-film transistors, batteries, solar cells, and others. The development of lightweight and mechanically resilient solar power sources is of increasing interest for transportable applications.156 Typically in flexible devices the electrode is deposited on a conducting plastic substrate. However, thermal degradation at high temperatures of most of the polymers used for the fabrication of the plastic substrates prevents the development of flexible DSSCs. Here the critical challenge is to achieve the good connectivity of TiO2 particles in a photo-electrode fabricated by a low-temperature process (below 150 °C) because most of the plastic substrates suffer from thermal degradation at the high temperatures (>450 °C) employed in the conventional sintering process. Several low-temperature methods such as chemical sintering157 or mechanical pressing158 have been proposed to improve the interconnectivity of TiO2 nanoparticles. Nevertheless, the degree of interconnectivity of particles or the adhesion between the resulting photoelectrode film and the substrate remains often unsatisfactory. To tackle this challenge, in 2012, Li et al. suggested a novel, low-temperature process for the fabrication of photo-electrodes composed of reinforced electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fibers and TiO2 NPs. Fig. 13(a) shows the spray-assisted electrospinning as a novel process of PVDF/TiO2 NP composites.159 The as-spun PVDF NFs with diameters of ca. 400 nm were synthesized by electrospinning, as shown in Fig. 13(b). Surface analysis of the as-spun PVDF/TiO2 NP composite fibers (CFs) demonstrated that TiO2 NPs were uniformly sprayed in the pore volume between the NFs. This material was tested with respect to organic binder-free films (BFs) which are conventional electrodes for flexible DSSCs processed at low-temperature. The PCE of these solar cells was poor, around 1%, however the PVDF/TiO2 photoanode revealed superior mechanical properties and a high stability even after 1000 bending cycles. Further developments on flexible substrates were achieved by implementing a bilayer photoanodic film composed of carbon nanotubes with TiO2 nanorods as under layers and branched TiO2 nanotubes as light scattering top layers. Flexible DSSCs were fabricated using these materials by combining electrospray deposition, compression, and microwave treatment at low temperature (<150 °C) leading to a PCE close to 4.2%.160

Apart from the low temperature of processing that is required by plastic substrates, the brittleness of inorganic photo-electrodes is another major problem that results in fractures and delamination under external bending forces. Consequently, under deformation the DSSCs show usually poor mechanical stability. To overcome this problem the development of a nanowire morphology with an orientation perpendicular to the substrate seems preferable. Indeed this configuration allows us to gain crack resistance, due to the efficient release of bending stress.161 However the implementation of electrospinning techniques for the preparation of vertically oriented nanotructures remains challenging. Another interesting approach consists of developing polymer–TiO2 hybrid composites162 or TiO2–inorganic photoelectrodes showing higher mechanical robustness. This strategy appears indeed to be more compatible with the electrospinning process. To illustrate this, one can mention the work of Zhu et al. who reported a photoanode that combines excellent bendability and flexibility and high-temperature durability.163
These authors reported a hybrid mat consisting of anatase-phased TiO2 nanofibers and amorphous SiO2 nanofibers prepared via the method of dual-spinneret electrospinning followed by pyrolysis. The hybrid fibrous mat was impregnated with binder-free TiO2 nanoparticles and sintered at 480 °C to form a flexible composite photoanode for DSSCs. The freestanding hybrid mat of TiO2–SiO2 nanofibers was then pressed on ITO/PET and after sintering at 150 °C, a flexible and bendable photoanode film was obtained. The performances of the corresponding flexible devices were rather low, around 1%, but the free-standing mesoporous electrodes developed in this work allow us to envision future developments of substrate-free flexible DSSCs.
4. Other types of photovoltaic devices
4.1 Organic solar cells
Organic bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells are devices usually fabricated by mixing p-type organic semi-conductors (such as a pi-conjugated polymer or a small molecule) and n-type semiconductors (that can be a fullerene derivative, a small molecule or a polymer). In organic BHJ solar cells electrospinning technics have been rarely explored compared to DSSC developments. However one can cite some studies that were devoted to the preparation of electrodes, electron transport layers, and also the photoactive layer of the devices.
Since 2010, electrospinning has been used as a tool to fabricate NFs made of either coaxially assembled P3HT and PCBM,164,165 or pure PCDTB.166 P3HT–PCBM blends are not directly electrospinnable. To overcome this problem, in 2012, P3HT:PCBM-containing fibers were produced in a coaxial fashion by utilizing poly(caprolactone) (PCL) as an electrospinnable sheath material (Fig. 14).164 The pure P3HT:PCBM fibers were obtained after electrospinning by selectively removing the PCL sheath with cyclopentanone. The resulting fibers show an average diameter of 120 ± 30 nm. They were incorporated into the active layer of a BHJ device and this resulted in improved operating parameters and PCE, as compared to thin-film devices of identical chemical composition. The best-performing fiber-based devices exhibited a PCE of 4%. This increased performance was related to the in-plane alignment of P3HT polymer chains within the fibers resulting from the electrospinning process, which leads to increased optical absorption and subsequent exciton generation. The NFs of PCDTBT of different diameters were obtained following a similar strategy with a sacrificial poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) matrix which is electrospun along the active polymer.
 Fig. 14  A schematic depicting P3HT:PCBM fiber generation from the coaxial fibers and the subsequent deposition of nanofibers within the active layer of the BHJ–OPV device, along with (a) a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrograph; (b) a TEM micrograph of P3HT:PCBM (core)–PCL (sheath) fibers (2.5 μm and 200 nm scale bars, respectively); (c) an SEM micrograph of P3HT:PCBM nanofibers after the removal of the PCL sheath (2 μm scale bar), and (d) a high-resolution TEM micrograph of the P3HT:PCBM fibers after the removal of the sheath PCL (25 nm scale bar).

PCDTBT:PEO NFs were electrospun onto a neat layer of PCDTB and after the selective removal of PEO, PCBM was spin-coated onto the fibers to complete the active layer. The higher Jsc of 11.54 mA cm2 for the cell with NFs (compared to 9.95 mA cm2 for conventional BHJ solar cells) was attributed to better exciton dissociation and charge transport. This was observed for the NFs with the lower diameter of 20 nm in which the dimension is close to the exciton diffusion length in organic materials. Some parameters such as the relative humidity level during the electrospinning process were investigated.167 Indeed Kim et al. studied the impact of external conditions on the formation of P3HT:PEO NFs. They found that the humidity rate modifies the kinetics of evaporation of the solvent during the process and therefore the structure of the final NFs. When humidity is high beads of pure P3HT are formed at the surface of NFs and as a consequence the photo-conversion efficiency of the corresponding devices drops significantly.
Apart from the materials of the active layer, electrode materials were also investigated. In particular some NWs were made of copper by electrospinning. In this work CuAc2/PVAc was electrospun on the substrate.168 After a calcination step under ambient conditions CuO NFs are obtained and subsequently annealed under a H2 atmosphere to give rise to pure Cu NFs with a diameter of 100 nm. The Cu NWs are well-interconnected and the transmittance as well as the sheet resistance of the resulting electrodes can be adjusted by playing with the NF coverage of the surface. This copper electrode compares favourably with other types of electrodes such as graphene-based electrodes which possess higher sheet resistance for similar transmittance. Moreover unlike ITO, the transmittance is relatively flat along the visible spectrum which is valuable for photovoltaic applications. The potential of the Cu-electrode was evaluated in BHJ device configuration with P3HT/PCBM as an active layer leading to a promising PCE of 3%. Interestingly the Cu-NF electrodes also exhibit good mechanical properties allowing their implementation on flexible substrates. ZnO was also investigated as an electron collecting electrode in BHJ devices because this semi-conductor possesses a high electron mobility. Elumalai et al. fabricated ZnO NW electron transport layers in inverted organic solar cells.169 The 1D structure of ZnO NWs greatly enhances charge collection compared to ZnO NPs. The NFs contributed to a better charge collection and FF leading to performances close to 3.5%.
4.2 Electrospun materials for perovskite solar cells
Metalorganic lead halide perovskites have emerged recently as a very promising class of hybrid materials for photovoltaics. Indeed perovskite solar cells combine high efficiency (>18%) with low cost fabrication via low-temperature solution processes. Perovskites can be integrated into various device configurations including the ones inspired by DSSCs and BHJ solar cells. Similar to DSSCs most of the approaches that include electrospun materials in perovskite solar cells concern the fabrication of the mesoporous photoanode. Dharani et al. prepared and used electrospun TiO2 NF mats as photoanodes and studied the effect of the TiO2 film thickness after sensitization with perovskite. They demonstrated a PCE of 9.82% for thicknesses of circa 400 nm.170
Later, Mahmood et al. made a hyper-branched TiO2 photoanode by using a procedure that combined electrospinning and a hydrothermal method to grow NRs on the spun NFs.171 An impressive PCE of 15.5% was obtained with a perovskite sensitizer using this unique hyper-branched structure. The technique was further extended by adding extra layers of these hyper-branched NFs to give a thicker photoanode. The results with perovskite were disappointing because of the difficulty in growing perovskite in the pores, but using N719 as a sensitizer a PCE of 11.2% was demonstrated.
The hyper-branched structure exhibits a higher diffusion coefficient and a longer electron lifetime compared to simple NFs and conventional NPs. In order to overcome the poor pore filling with perovskite in the mesoporous photoanode, Xiao et al. developed a process to grow CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite directly onto TiO2 NFs.172 First TiO2:PbO doped NFs were prepared by electrospinning, and then the mats were dipped into HI solution and dried. TiO2:PbI2 NFs were obtained and these fibers were subsequently used as substrates to spin-coat a solution of PbI2 on top. After this step the material was then immersed in a solution of CH3NH3I to form the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer. This method allowed the author to have a relatively high thickness of mesoporous films and therefore have better light harvesting. This strategy was successful and diminished the loss of photo-generated electrons thanks to the efficient collection and transport of charges in the NFs. The photo-conversion efficiency reached 9% without using any hole transporting material. Similar to DSSCs some work has also been done on alternative metal oxides such as Zn2SnO4. Following previously described methods, Zn2SnO4 NFs were prepared through electrospinning techniques. Highly porous fibers were obtained after calcination at 700 °C and then used for sensitization with perovskite. A maximum PCE of 7.38% was obtained for the best cell but interestingly it showed a moderate hysteresis compared to NP-based devices.173
So far no electrospun CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite material has been obtained however some perovskites made of bismuth ferrite were successfully synthesized by electrospinning by Fei et al.174 Up to now these materials have shown a low photovoltaic effect.
5. Conclusion and outlook
In this review, we summarize almost all aspects of electrospun materials for application in emerging solar cell technologies including dye-sensitized solar cells, organic solar cells and perovskite solar cells. The synthesis of novel materials, the development of fabrication procedures leading to unique nanostructures, the determination of their properties and performances in real devices and the latest developments are presented in detail underlining the valuable contribution of electrospinning to the development of innovative and efficient materials for solar energy conversion. The increasing success of electrospinning as a tool for engineering nanomaterials is strongly related to the versatility of the technique that allows the preparation of a large variety of systems. The chemical composition, the shape, the crystallinity, the orientation and the surface coverage of electrospun materials can be easily controlled by adjusting key parameters. So far, most of the examples in the field of solar cells are dealing with the preparation of nanostructured electrode materials in DSSCs but electrospinning has been successfully employed more recently to fabricate organic bulk-heterojunction solar cells and perovskite solar cells. These developments open new doors for future laboratory research and improvement in solar energy conversion systems.
In other fields of applications such as energy storage devices, the market of electrospun materials is predicted to grow gradually and considerably owing to the advantages of the technique as discussed above. Besides, in the last decade, electrospinning machines compatible with industrial processes have been developed to realize the large-scale production of electrospun fibers. Therefore it is expected that photovoltaic technologies will benefit from these recent developments.
The increasing development of electrospun materials and methods in laboratory research and industry will surely contribute to pushing the forthcoming electrospinning products with low cost and low environmental impact toward industrialization in the field of energy conversion systems.
